The '''Arden Park-East Boston Historic District''' is a  neighborhood in the City of [[Detroit]], Michigan, bounded on the west by [[Woodward Avenue]], on the north by East Boston Boulevard, on the east by Oakland Avenue, and on the south by Arden Park Boulevard. <ref name="city">[http://www.ci.detroit.mi.us/historic/districts/arden_park.pdf The Detroit Historic District Commission]</ref>  The area is immediately adjacent to the larger [[Boston-Edison Historic District]], on the opposite side of Woodward Avenue, and is in close proximity to [[Atkinson Avenue Historic District|Atkinson Avenue]].  There are 92 homes in the district, all on East Boston and Arden Park Boulevards.<ref name="be">[http://www.historicbostonedison.org/apeb.shtml Arden Park East Boston from Boston-Edison]</ref>  Arden Park Boulevard and East Boston Boulevard feature prominent grassy medians with richly planted trees and flowers. The setbacks of the homes are deep, with oversized lots. The district was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1982.<ref name = "nris"/>

==History==
The neighborhood was originally platted in 1892 by Joseph R. McLaughlin and Edmund J. Owen along two streets east of Woodward: specifically, East Boston Boulevard and East Chicago Boulevard.<ref name="det1701">[http://www.detroit1701.org/ArdenPark_Hist.htm Detroit 1701]</ref> and given the name "McLaughlin and Owen's Subdivision."<ref name="be"/><ref name="mo">[http://www.cis.state.mi.us/platmaps/dt_image.asp?BCC_SUBINDEX=1068 Plat map of McLaughlin and Owen's Subdivision] from the state of Michigan.</ref>  The lots were spacious to attract the city's wealthier residents.<ref name="mod">[http://www.modeldmedia.com/developmentnews/arden51.aspx Model D Media]</ref>  The subdivision was sold twice before being purchased by Max Broock, a prominent real estate developer, in 1910.<ref name="be"/>  At Broock's urging, the name of "East Chicago" was changed to "Arden Park," giving the thoroughfare its present name.<ref name="city"/>

==Homes and early residents==
Although the neighborhood was first platted in 1892, most of the homes built in the community date to the first two decades of the Twentieth Century.<ref name="det1701"/>  This time period coincided with an economic boom in Detroit, and many newly-minted millionaires hired architects to design prestigious dwellings in the neighborhood.<ref name="det1701"/>  [[Architectural styles]] represented in Arden Park-East Boston include [[Italian Renaissance]], [[Colonial Revival]], [[Tudorbethan architecture|Tudor]], [[Bungalow]] style and [[Prairie Style]].

Some of the neighborhood's first residents included automotive icons [[Frederick Fisher]] and [[John Francis Dodge|John Dodge]], retail pioneer [[J.L. Hudson]]<ref name="city"/>, as well as [[Alexander Y. Malcomson]],<ref name="marq">Albert Nelson Marquis, [http://books.google.com/books?id=wEevJkgsgoYC&printsec=frontcover&num=100&as_brr=3#PPA312 ''The Book of Detroiters''], 1908, A. N. Marquis & Co., p. 312</ref> Clayton and Albert Grinnell.  Another retail magnate, Stanley Kresge, Jr.<ref name="be"/> of K-Mart fame, resided in the community.  The home of Frederick Fisher, on Arden Park Boulevard, was built in 1918 in the Italian Villa style to the plan of architect George D. Mason. The residence--which comprises nearly {{convert|12000|sqft|m2}}--is built entirely of Indiana limestone and features elaborate stone-carvings and ironwork. 

The neighborhood's most prominent landmark is the [[Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament]]. Next door to the cathedral, is the personal residence of Detroit's Roman Catholic Cardinal Archbishop.
