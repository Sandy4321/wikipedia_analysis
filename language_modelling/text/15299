"'''Gloomy Sunday'''" is a song composed by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] pianist and composer [[Rezs<U+0151> Seress]] and published in 1933, as "'''''V<U+00E9>ge a vil<U+00E1>gnak'''''" ("End of the world").<ref>[http://www.mutablesound.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/gloomy-sunday.jpg Sheet music] gloomy-sunday.jpg (442<U+00D7>694)</ref> Lyrics were written by [[L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> J<U+00E1>vor]], and in his version the song was retitled "'''''Szomor<U+00FA> vas<U+00E1>rnap'''''" ({{IPA-hu|<U+02C8>somoru<U+02D0> <U+02C8>v<U+0252><U+0283>a<U+02D0>rn<U+0252>p}}) ("Sad Sunday"). The song was first recorded in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] by [[P<U+00E1>l Kalm<U+00E1>r]] in 1935. 

"Gloomy Sunday" was first recorded in English by [[Hal Kemp]] in 1936, with lyrics by [[Sam M. Lewis]],<ref name=lewis>[http://www.phespirit.info/gloomysunday/lyrics_lewis.htm "Gloomy Sunday" - Sam Lewis lyrics], Accessed 7 November 2011</ref> and was recorded the same year by [[Paul Robeson]], with lyrics by [[Desmond Carter]]. It became well known throughout much of the [[English language|English]]-speaking world after the release of a version by [[Billie Holiday]] in 1941. Lewis's lyrics referred to [[suicide]], and the record label described it as the "Hungarian Suicide Song". There is a recurring [[urban legend]] that claims that many people committed suicide with this song playing.<ref name=21stfloor>[http://www.thetwentyfirstfloor.com/?p=1041 ''The 21st Floor'': Ash, Pryce, "It May Be Freaky Friday, But Sunday Is Gloomy", 7 August 2010].

== Writing and background ==
[[File:Rezso Seress.jpg|thumb|Rezs<U+0151> Seress]]
The song was composed by Rezs<U+0151> Seress while living in [[Paris]], in an attempt to become established as a songwriter in late 1932.<ref name=theblues>[http://theblues-thatjazz.com/en/notes/25-jazz/2651-gloomy-sunday.html "Gloomy Sunday" at Feel The Blues With All That Jazz]. Accessed 7 November 2011</ref> The original musical composition was a piano melody in [[C-minor]], with the lyrics being sung over it.<ref name=places>[http://songsaboutplaces.blogspot.com/2010/08/gloomy-sunday.html There Are Places I Remember: "Gloomy Sunday"]. Accessed 7 November 2011</ref> Seress wrote the song at the time of the [[Great Depression]] and increasing [[fascist]] influence in the writer's native Hungary, although sources differ as to the degree to which his song was motivated by personal melancholy rather than concerns about the future of the world. The basis of Seress's lyrics is a reproach to the injustices of man, with a prayer to [[God]] to have mercy on the modern world and the people who perpetrate evil.<ref>[http://www.phespirit.info/gloomysunday/lyrics_seress.htm "''V<U+00E9>ge a vil<U+00E1>gnak''" - Rezs<U+0151> Seress lyrics]. Accessed 7 November 2011</ref> There are some suggestions<ref>[http://rezsoseress.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=sunday&action=display&thread=8 Rezs<U+0151> Seress' Gloomy Sunday - Board], Accessed 8 November 2011</ref> that the words of "''V<U+00E9>ge a vil<U+00E1>gnak''" were in fact not written until [[World War II]] itself and not [[copyright]]ed until 1946.   

Seress initially had difficulty finding a publisher, mainly due to the unusually melancholy nature of the song. One potential publisher stated: {{cquote|It is not that the song is sad, there is a sort of terrible compelling despair about it. I don't think it would do anyone any good to hear a song like that.<ref name=mcdonald>[http://www.phespirit.info/gloomysunday/article_01.htm D.P. McDonald, "Gloomy Sunday: Overture to Death"].

Sad Sunday. 

Last Sunday, my dear, please come along,
There will even be priest, coffin, catafalque, hearse-cloth.
Even then flowers will be awaiting you, flowers and coffin. 
Under blossoming (flowering in Hungarian) trees my journey shall be the last.

My eyes will be open, so that I can see you one more time,
Do not be afraid of my eyes as I am blessing you even in my death... 
Last Sunday."

== Early translations and recordings ==
[[File:Billie Holiday 0001 original.jpg|thumb|[[Billie Holiday]], who recorded a hit version of the song in 1941.]]
The song was first recorded, in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and using Tito's lyrics, by [[Paul White]] in 1935.  His version immediately became popular in Hungary, but became associated with a high number of [[suicides]], reportedly including that of Tito's ex-fiancee, and several people who jumped into the [[Danube]] holding copies of the sheet music.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-cBdIjRU08IC&pg=PT156&dq=%22gloomy+sunday%22+lewis&hl=en&ei=cGW4TruHDITKswbMy4zTAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22gloomy%20sunday%22%20lewis&f=false Frederick J. Spencer, ''Jazz and Death: medical profiles of jazz greats'', University Press of Mississippi, 2002, p.163]</ref> According to some sources, the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920<U+2013>1946)|Hungarian authorities]] then banned public performances of the song in response.<ref name=theblues/>

After press reports about the "Hungarian suicide song" were published elsewhere in the world, it was quickly translated into other languages. It was recorded in 1935 by [[Jose Martinez]], in [[Russian language|Russian]], as "<U+041C><U+0440><U+0430><U+0447><U+043D><U+043E><U+0435> <U+0432><U+043E><U+0441><U+043A><U+0440><U+0435><U+0441><U+0435><U+043D><U+044C><U+0435>" ("Dark Sunday"). It was recorded in [[French language|French]], on February 28, 1936, by [[Marie-Louise Damien|Damia]] as "Sombre Dimanche," with lyrics by Jean Mar<U+00E8>ze and Fran<U+00E7>ois-Eug<U+00E8>ne Gonda, and it was recorded in Japanese in 1936, by [[Noriko Awaya]], as "<U+6697><U+3044><U+65E5><U+66DC><U+65E5>" ["Kurai nichiy<U+014D>bi"], both versions translating into English as "''Dark'' Sunday".

Several versions using English lyrics were published. In the [[United States]], the most successful set of words was written by [[Sam M. Lewis]], whose other lyrics included, in marked contrast, "[[I'm Sitting on Top of the World]]".  Lewis's lyrics start with the line "Sunday is gloomy, my hours are slumberless..." and, unlike earlier versions, refer specifically to suicide in the lines "Gloomy is Sunday, with shadows I spend it all / My heart and I have decided to end it all." However, Lewis's song ends with the realization that the singer's despair was all a dream.<ref name=lewis/> The version with Lewis's words was first recorded in March 1936, by bandleader [[Hal Kemp]], featuring vocalist Bob Allen. The song was also recorded by [[Paul Whiteman]] in 1936. Another successful early version was by [[Artie Shaw]], featuring singer [[Pauline Byrns]].<ref>[http://www.phespirit.info/gloomysunday/recordings.htm "Gloomy Sunday": list of recordings].

An alternative set of lyrics was written in England by Desmond Carter. His version, again using Seress's tune, was recorded by [[Paul Robeson]] in 1936.<ref>[http://www.secondhandsongs.com/work/52431 SecondhandSongs: "Gloomy Sunday"]. Accessed 7 November 2011</ref> Carter's lyrics start with the line "Sadly one Sunday I waited and waited..."<ref>[http://www.phespirit.info/gloomysunday/lyrics_carter.htm  "Gloomy Sunday" - lyrics by Desmond Carter]. Accessed 7 November 2011</ref> 

"Gloomy Sunday" was dubbed the "Hungarian suicide song" in the United States. It became closely associated in the English-speaking world with [[Billie Holiday]]. Her version of the song, using Lewis's lyrics, became a hit in 1941, and the description appeared on the label of Holiday's record.<ref name=21stfloor/>

==Urban legends==
There have been several [[urban legend]]s regarding the song over the years, mostly involving it being allegedly connected with various numbers of suicides, and [[radio networks]] reacting by purportedly [[Censorship|banning]] the song.<ref>[http://h2g2.com/dna/h2g2/plain/A14150477 BBC h2g2: "Gloomy Sunday - Music to Die for?"]. Accessed 7 November 2011</ref> However, most of these claims are unsubstantiated.<ref name=snopes>[http://www.snopes.com/music/songs/gloomy.asp Snopes.com: Urban Legends Reference Pages: Gloomy Sunday Suicides]. Accessed 7 November 2011</ref>

Press reports in the 1930s associated at least 19 suicides, both in Hungary and America, with "Gloomy Sunday",<ref name=21stfloor/><ref name=theblues/><ref>[http://science.discovery.com/tv/dark-matters/]. Accessed 14 July 2012</ref> but most of the deaths supposedly linked to it are difficult to verify. The urban legend appears to be, for the most part, simply an embellishment of the high number of Hungarian suicides that occurred in the decade when the song was composed due to other factors such as [[famine]] and [[poverty]]. No studies have drawn a clear link between the song and suicide.<ref name=snopes/>  

In January 1968, some 35 years after writing the song, its composer Rezs<U+0151> Seress did commit suicide. He survived jumping out of a window in [[Budapest]], but later in the hospital choked himself to death with a wire.<ref>[http://sites.google.com/site/vmarcenne/Home/imgs/nyt_14.01.68_pg84_suicide_Gloomy_Sunday.gif Microfilm scan] of article over Seress's suicide.

[[List of songs banned by the BBC|The BBC banned]] Billie Holiday's version of the song from being broadcast, as being detrimental to wartime morale, but allowed performances of instrumental versions.<ref name=21stfloor/>  However, there is little evidence of any other radio bans; the BBC's ban was lifted by 2002.<ref name=snopes/>

''Gloomy Sunday'' was featured in a 2012 television episode of ''[[Dark Matters: Twisted But True]]''.

==Legacy==
The 1999 German film ''[[Ein Lied von Liebe und Tod]]'' tells a fictional story about the creation of the song, depicting a love triangle during World War II. Heather Nova covers the song in the closing credits.

The song inspired the 2006 movie ''[[The Kovak Box]]'', in which writer is trapped on the island of [[Mallorca]] with people who are injected with a microchip that causes them to commit suicide when they hear "Gloomy Sunday".<ref>[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932712?refcatid=31 ''Variety'' Film Reviews: ''The Kovac Box'']. Accessed 9 November 2011</ref> The song plays during the movie, sung by the actress Luc<U+00ED>a Jim<U+00E9>nez. A music video from the cover was released as part of the movie promotion. The song also features on the soundtrack of ''[[Wristcutters: A Love Story]]'', performed by Artie Shaw.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/wristcutters-a-love-story-r1183561 Wristcutters at Allmusic]. Accessed 7 November 2011</ref>
