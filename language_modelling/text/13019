{{Life in Malaysia}}
'''Religion in Malaysia''' is complex, with the country being multicultural and multiconfessional. The dominant religion is Islam, whose followers make up 60 per cent of the population. Islam is recognised as the state religion of [[Malaysia]], although the country has a secular constitution. Debate exists about whether Malaysia should be a secular or Islamic state, with politics often becoming entwined with religion. Due to contention with an Islamic opposition, the ruling government has slowly become more Islamic, with Islam beginning to have more influence over day to day life in Malaysia. The government promotes the spread of Islam, which is under the control of individual states.

Religion often follows ethnic lines, with most Muslims being Malays. The code of Islam enforced is [[Sunni]]. Islam was introduced by traders, becoming firmly established in the 15th century. Islam is generally tolerant, integrating some former customs and being tolerant. The government promotes a moderate form of Islam known as ''Islam Hadhari''. Any teaching which deviate from the official Sunni code are illegal, and no other forms of Islam are allowed. The country has both civil and [[Shariah]] courts, with all muslims having to follow Shariah laws. These are enforced by the government and police forces.

The large Chinese population in Malaysia practices a mix of beliefs, with influences from traditional chinese religions such as Buddhism and Daoism. Hinduism is practised by the majority of [[Malaysian Indian]]s. In recent years the government has demolished many Hindu temples, causing concern among the Indian population. Christianity has established itself in some communities, especially in [[East Malaysia]]. It is not tied to any specific ethnic group. Other religions, such as [[Baha'i]] and [[Sikhism]] also have adherents in Malaysia.

Relations between different religious groups are generally quite tolerant. Christmas, Chinese New Year, and Deepavali have been declared national holidays alongside Islamic holidays. various groups have been set up to try and promote religious understanding among the different groups, with religious harmony seen as a priority by Malaysian politicians. However, it is illegal to convert Muslims to other religions, and disputes have arisen over the use of the word "Allah" for God in religions other than Islam. Restrictions on religious freedom exist, especially for Muslims, who are often not allowed to legally convert to other religions, and are forced into rehabilitation camps if they attempt to.

* 60.4% [[Islam]]
* 19.2% [[Buddhism]]
* 9.1% [[Christianity]]
* 6.3% [[Hinduism]]
* 2.6% [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and other traditional [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese religions]]
* 1.5% other faiths, including [[animism]], [[folk religion]], and [[Sikhism]]
* 0.9% reported having no religion or did not provide any information.

The majority of [[Malaysian Malay]]s people are Muslim.<ref name="Matic"/> The majority of [[Malaysian Indian]]s follow Hinduism (84.5%), with a significant minority identifying as Christians (7.7%), Muslims (3.8%), over 150,000 [[Sikh]]s, and 1,000 [[Jain]]s. There are also a large number of [[Sikh]]s and [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>]]s found in the country. There are around 100,000 Sikhs mainly Punjabis in Malaysia. Whereas, there are around 50,000 Baha'is of various races in Malaysia.

Most [[Malaysian Chinese]] follow a combination of [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[ancestor-worship]]<ref name="Matic"/> but, when pressed to specify their religion, will identify themselves as Buddhists and will list themselves as such for bureaucratic purposes. Statistics from the 2000 Census indicate that 75.9% of Malaysia's ethnic Chinese identify as Buddhist, with significant numbers of adherents following Taoism (10.6%) and Christianity (9.6%), along with small [[Hui people|Hui-Muslim]] populations in areas like [[Penang]].<ref name="Census 2000" />

Christianity is the predominant religion of the non-Malay [[Bumiputra]] community (50.1%) with an additional 36.3% identifying as Muslims and 7.3% follow [[folk religion]].<ref name="Census 2000"/> The indigenous tribes of [[East Malaysia]] have mostly converted to Christianity, although Christianity has made fewer inroads into [[Peninsular Malaysia]].<ref name="Matic"/> In addition to Christian missionaries from overseas, there are ongoing efforts by the government and NGOs to convert the animist communities to Islam, especially amongst the peninsular tribes who are not entitled to bumiputra status.

==Law and politics==
[[Islam]] is the religion of the Federation, although Malaysia is a multi-religious society and the Malaysian constitution guarantees [[religious freedom]].<ref name="StateReligion">{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71347.htm |title=Malaysia |publisher=United States Department of State |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> Religious beliefs follow ethnic lines.<ref name="MSU">{{cite web|url=http://asia.isp.msu.edu/wbwoa/southeast_asia/malaysia/religion.htm |title=Malaysia - Religion |publisher=Michigan State University |accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref> Holidays have been declared for holy days in numerous religions,<ref name="StateReligion"/> although only Islam has more than one national holiday.<ref name="MSU"/> Whether a religion obtains approval of the government is determined by the Registrar of Societies, part of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Only upon approval do they qualify for government benefits. However, unrecognised groups such as the [[Falun Gong]] can practise by registering themselves under the Companies Act, although this means that technical violations of the act can result in a fine.<ref name="StateReligion"/>

The government believes the constitution provides a strong enough guarantee of religious freedom and should not be changed. Some restrictions are made on Malay texts from non islamic religions in Peninsula Malaysia, however there are much less restrictions in East Malaysia. Headscarves are mandatory for non-muslims in certain situations.<ref name="StateReligion"/> The [[MyKad]] identity card states whether the holder is a muslim or not.<ref name="MSU"/>

As Islam is the state religions, the government provides financial support to Islamic establishments and enforces the [[Sunni]] form of Islam. State governments can impose Islamic law on Muslims, and the government will offer grants to private Muslim schools that allow a government-approved curriculum and supervision. The government also indirectly funds non-Islamic communities, although to a much smaller degree. The government generally does not interfere with the religious practices of non-Muslim communities. Public schools offer an Islamic religious instruction course which is compulsory for Muslim students, and non-Muslim students take a morals and ethics course.<ref name="StateReligion"/>

The government prohibits any publications that it feels will incite racial or religious disharmony,<ref name="StateReligion"/> and has asked that religious matters not be discussed in public due to their sensitivity.<ref name="Secret">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/6150340.stm |title=Life as a secret Christian convert |last=Pressly |first=Linda |publisher=BBC |date=15 November 2006 |accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> It claims nobody has been arrested under the [[Internal Security Act]] for religious reasons.

Both [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) and the opposition [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party]] (PAS) party have attempted to deliver political messages using mosques in the states they govern. All civil servants must attend government-approved religion classes. BN has banned opposition-affiliated imams from mosques, enforced restrictions on sermons, replaced opposition sympathetic mosque leaders and governing committees, and closed down unauthorised mosques affiliated with the opposition. The state government of Selangor in August 2005 withheld visas from foreign imams in order to try and increase the number of local imams. PAS, which controls the state of [[Kelantan]] restricts imams affiliated with BN from their mosques. It is thought that support for a moderate Islam led to the 2004 election victory of BN over PAS in the state of [[Terengganu]].<ref name="StateReligion"/> Both parties became more islamic in the 1980s and 1990s in order to try and obtain more of the Malay vote.<ref name="Pressure"/> Political problems are often portrayed as religious issues.<ref>{{Citation

These Islamic courts have unanimously ruled that all ethnic Malays must remain Muslims.

The debate over laws about conversion has been strong in academic and political circles, with the many non-Muslims against the law conflicting with the Muslim group who strongly support the law, causing the government a dilemma. It is illegal to disseminate any non-Islamic religious material to Muslims.

In February 2005 the Malaysian Bar Council organised the discussion of an interfaith commission, although several Islamic groups refused to participate claiming the commission would "weaken Islam". Several Muslim groups boycotted and condemned an interfaith council, claiming Islam should only be discussed by Muslims.

In 2006 a memorandum was presented to the prime minister by non-Muslim cabinet members asking for a review of constitutional provisions affecting the rights of non-Muslims. After protests by Muslim leaders in the governing coalition, this was withdrawn.

Although most people in Malaya were Muslim by the 15th century, the tolerant form of islam brought by the Sufi meant that many traditional practices were incorporated into islamic traditions.<ref name="MSU"/> Islam is generally practiced liberally, although in the last 20 years strict adherence to Islamic practice has increased.<ref name="MSU"/> The code of Islam official in Malaysia is [[Sunni]], and the practise of any other form of Islam is heavily restricted. The government opposes what it calls "Deviant" teachings, forcing those who are deemed to follow these teachings to undergo "rehabilitation". In June 2006 56 deviant teachings had been identified by the government, including Shi'a, transcendental meditation, and Baha'i teachings. In June 2005 religious authorities reported that there were 22 "deviant" religious groups with around 2,820 followers in Malaysia. No statistics are given on rehabilitations, and the government actively monitors Shi'a groups. Restrictions have been imposed on Imams coming from overseas.<ref name="StateReligion"/> 

The Malaysian government promotes a moderate version of Sunni Islam called ''Islam Hadhari''. ''Islam Hadhari'' was introduced by former Prime Minister [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]]. It is meant to encourage a balanced approach to life, and encourages inclusivity, tolerance, and looking outwards. The qualities it values are knowledge, hard work, honesty, good administration, and efficiency. The Islamic party [[PAS]] desires a stricter interpretation of Islam and the promotion of Islamic law. Due to Islam being the state religion, many mosques and other religious services are supported by the government.<ref name="MSU"/> Control of the mosques is usually done on a state rather than a federal level.<ref name="StateReligion"/> The charitable [[Zak<U+0101>t]] tax is collected by the government, and the government supports those wishing to make the [[Hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]].<ref name="MSU"/>

Traditional Chinese beliefs have become a strong influence in life, and new sects have arisen trying to integrate different religious teachings. Beliefs in Malaysia have also often adopted influence from local animism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com.my/volume10/buddhism.html |title=Buddhism and Chinese Religions |publisher=The Encyclopaedia of Malaysia |author1=Benny Liow Woon Khin |author2=Ong Seng Hua |accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref>

Around 19 per cent of the current population<U+00A0>classify themselves as Buddhist. Each religious building is autonomous, and most Malaysian Chinese follow the [[Mahayana]] branch. Thai and Sinhalese minorities in Malaysia follow the [[Therevada]] branch. A Malaysian Buddhist Council has been created to promote the study and practice of Buddhism and promote solidarity among Malaysian Buddhists. [[Vesak]] day is a national holiday, and joint celebrations take place in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor by both branches of Buddhism. Buddhist temples often contain Daoist deities, with most deities being from the [[Provinces of the People's Republic of China|Chinese provinces]] of [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]]. Malaysia has over 150 Daoist temples served by 12000 priest, with the Daoist communities sharing links with those in [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] and [[Mainland China]]. Although the religion is not as organised as others, a Malaysia Daoist Association was formed in 1995 and a Daoist Organisation League was formed in 1997.<ref name="MSU"/>

==Hinduism==
[[Image:Man at Penang Thaipusam.jpg|thumb|Thaipusam ([[Thaipusam]], [[Malaysia]])]]
The majority of the Tamil's who make up 9 per cent of Malaysia's population practice Hinduism. Hinduism was influential prior to Islam, but current adherents are mostly descended from migrant communities from [[Tamil Nadu]] who came to Malaya to work on British rubber plantations. A small community of migrants from North India also exists.<ref name="MSU"/>

Urban temples are often dedicated to a single deity, while rural temples are often home to many different deities. Most were brought with immigrants. Most temples follow [[Saivite]] tradition from Southern India, for the worship of [[Siva]]. The Hindu holiday of [[Deepavali]] is a national holiday.<ref name="MSU"/> Practice of the Hindu religion in Malaysia is strongly linked with the cultural identity of Indians who reside there. Someone who converts to another religion may be ostracised by their family and the Indian community.<ref name="POI">{{Citation

==Christianity==
About 10 per cent of the population of Malaysia are Christians, including Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indian minorities. The most common denominations are [[Anglican]], [[Methodist]], and [[Roman Catholic]]. Most Christians are found in [[East Malaysia]], where Good Friday is a public holiday in the states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]]. [[Christmas]] is a national holiday, although Easter is not.<ref name="MSU"/>

Traders with links to Christianity from the Middle East arrived in what is now Malaysia in the 7th century. Catholicism was brought by the Portuguese in the 15th century, followed by Protestantism with the Dutch in 1641. As Portuguese influence declined Protestantism began to eclipse Catholicism. Christianity spread further through missionaries who arrived during British rule in the 19th century and introduced christianity to East Malaysia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com.my/volume10/history.html |title=History of Christianity in Malaysia |author=Hermen Shastri |publisher=Encyclopaedia of Malaysia |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> Initial conversions focused mainly on the [[Straits Settlements]]. When missionaries began to spread through the peninsula, they were discouraged from converting Malays, focusing on Chinese and Indian immigrants.<ref name="Sacred">{{Cite book

Christianity has become restricted as Malaysia has become more Islamic. Restrictions have been placed on the construction of new churches, although existing ones are allowed to operate. The city of [[Shah Alam]] has not allowed any churches to be built. Christians are not allowed to attempt the conversion of Muslims and their literature must have a note saying it is for non-Muslims only. Similarly, the movie [[The Passion of the Christ]] was restricted only to Christian viewers.<ref name="MSU"/> In April 2005 two christians were arrested for distributing Christian material in front of a mosque, although charges were later dropped. The restrictions of the dissemination of Malay-language Christian material is much less strict in East Malaysia than in the west. [[Good Friday]] is also an official holiday in East Malaysia, although not a national one.<ref name="StateReligion"/>

The use of the Malay word "Allah" for God has caused a dispute in Malaysia, with [[malay language]] bibles banned due to the use of this word.<ref name="MSU"/> It was argued that as the bibles could be used to spread religions other than Islam, they were against the constitution. Other ministers opposed this discrimination. In 2005 [[Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz]] tried to enforce this, although some of his ministers argued the national language could be used for any purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asianews.it/index.php?art=3144&l=en |title=No Bible in local languages |publisher=AsiaNews |date=26 April 2005 |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> The bible in the indigenous [[Iban language]] was allowed as they had no alternate word besides Allah for God.<ref name="MSU"/>

==Other==
A small [[Sikh]] community exists in Malaysia, brought by the British to form police units. They follow [[Sikhism]], and open their [[Gurdwara|places of worship]] to all races ages and genders. No Sikh holiday has been declared a national holiday,<ref name="MSU"/> although there are 120,000 in the country. Sikhs have, like Christians, come under pressure not to use the word "Allah" for God in their religious texts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6985866.ece |title=Stones thrown at Malaysian Sikh temple following religious row |last=Parry |first=Richard Lloyd |publisher=The Sunday Times |date=13 January 2010 |accessdate=17 July 2011}}</ref>

A small [[Jew]]ish community existed on the island of [[Penang]]. Jews first came into contact with the Malay peninsula during the 11th century when Jewish traders traded with the [[Kedah Sultanate]] and [[Langkasuka]]. Many Jews in Malaysia came from Persia. After the communist takeover in China, more Jews fled to Southeast Asia. However, the Jewish community declined, with many emigrating to countries such as Australia. Due to not having enough members to hold some Jewish rituals, the only [[synagogue]] in Penang, established in 1932, was shut down in 1976. The last burial in Penang's Jewish cemetery took pace in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.penangstory.net.my/mino-content-paperhimanshu.html |title=The Jews of Penang |author=Himanshu Bhatt |publisher=Penang Story |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> By 1990s the community had disappeared, and it is now thought that there are only two Jews who hold Malaysian passports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishnews.net.au/life-in-jewish-malaysia |title=Life in Jewish Malaysia |last=Harris |first=Andrew |date=17 July 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref>

A small [[Baha'i]] group exists in Malaysia, with members from Chinese, Eurasian, Indian, Indigenous communities. It was introduced to Malaya by a Farsi couple in 1950, with the first National Spiritual Assembly being elected in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bahai.org.my/ |title=Malaysian Baha'i Community |publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Malaysia |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref>

Traditional beliefs are still practiced by the [[Orang Asal]] people. Loosely classified as animism, the beliefs are not recognised by the state as a religion. Animistic beliefs are passed down through oral tradition due to the lack of a writing system in indigenous groups, who call their beliefs ''agama adat'' (traditional or customary religions). The different religions are rather varied, with different names and concepts for their supreme god and other supernatural deities. Most of the beliefs are heavily influenced by the environment, with physical features such as mountains, trees, valleys, and rivers being sacred. A close relationship with nature is nurtured, and the relationship of humans and nature is a strong part of the religion, with everyday activities such as hunting and gathering having spiritual significance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com.my/volume10/indigenous.html |title=Indigenous Beliefs |author=Ghazali bin Basri |publisher=Encyclopaedia of Malaysia |accessdate=17 July 2011}}</ref>
