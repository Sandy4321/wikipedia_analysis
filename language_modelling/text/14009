'''Niagara Falls BOMARC Missile Site''' is a closed [[United States Air Force]] [[CIM-10 Bomarc]] missile site.  It was located adjacent to the [[Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station]], {{convert|5.1|mi|km}} east-northeast of [[Niagara Falls, New York]].  It was closed in 1969.

==History==
The site was constructed beginning in 1959 as a [[CIM-10 Bomarc]] surface-to-air anti-aircraft missile base.  It was activated on 1 June 1960, concurrently with the '''35th Air Defense Missile Squadron'''.  The missiles were declared operationally ready on 1 December 1961.

The site stood alert until 31 December 1969 when the missiles were inactivated along with the 35th ADMS.   It stood vacant for a number of years until being turned over to [[Niagara Falls International Airport]].  It has now been redeveloped with no evidence of its [[Cold War]] military past.
