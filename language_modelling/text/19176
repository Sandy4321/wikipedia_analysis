'''Garth Ennis''' (born 16 January 1970) is a [[Northern Irish]] [[comics]] writer, best known for the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] series ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'' with artist [[Steve Dillon]] and his successful nine-year run on [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Punisher]] franchise. He has collaborated with artists such as [[Steve Dillon]] and [[Glenn Fabry]] on ''Preacher'', [[John McCrea]] on ''Hitman'', and [[Carlos Ezquerra]] on both ''Preacher'' and ''Hitman''.

==Career==
Ennis began his comic-writing career in [[1989 in comics|1989]] with the series ''Troubled Souls''. Appearing in the short-lived but critically acclaimed British anthology ''[[Crisis (comic)|Crisis]]'' and illustrated by McCrea, it told the story of a young, [[Wiktionary:apolitical|apolitical]] [[Protestant]] man caught up by fate in the violence of the Irish '[[The Troubles|Troubles]]'. It spawned a sequel, ''For a Few Troubles More'', a broad [[Belfast]]-based comedy featuring two supporting characters from ''Troubled Souls'', Dougie and Ivor, who would later get their own American comics series, ''[[Dicks (comics)|Dicks]]'', from [[Caliber Comics|Caliber]] in 1997, and several follow-ups from [[Avatar Press|Avatar]].

Another series for ''Crisis'' was ''True Faith'', a religious satire inspired by his schooldays, this time drawn by [[Warren Pleece]]. Like the two ''Troubles'' stories it was collected as a graphic novel in 1990, but religious protests led to it being quickly withdrawn from sale, apparently on the orders of publisher [[Robert Maxwell]]. It was later republished in 1997 by Vertigo.

Ennis shortly after began to write for Crisis' parent publication, ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]''. He quickly graduated on to the title's flagship character, [[Judge Dredd]], taking over from original creator [[John Wagner]] for a period of several years.  Ennis's most notable ''Dredd'' stories include ''Muzak Killer'' (a pastiche of mainstream pop music), ''Emerald Isle'' (a tongue-in-cheek story set in Ennis's native Ireland), and the twenty-part epic ''[[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Judgment Day]].'' Ennis also contributed the surreal ''Time Flies'' (with artist [[Philip Bond]]), dealing with time travel paradoxes and Nazis.

Ennis' first work on an American comic came in [[1991 in comics|1991]] when he took over [[DC Comics]]'s horror title ''[[Hellblazer]]'', which he wrote until [[1994 in comics|1994]], and for which he currently holds the title for most issues written.<ref name="vert-hell">{{Citation  | last = Irvine | first = Alex | author-link = Alexander C.

The creative partnership established went on to create ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]''. From [[1993 in comics|1993]] to [[1995 in comics|1995]] Ennis and [[John McCrea]] worked on another DC title, ''[[The Demon (comics)|The Demon]]'', during which they introduced super-powered contract killer Tommy Monaghan, also known as [[Hitman (comics)|Hitman]], whose own series would allow their creative partnership to continue when ''The Demon'' ended.  Towards the end of the initial ''[[Hellblazer]]'' run, Ennis and Dillon collaborated on a one-shot called ''[[Heartland (comics)|Heartland]]'', exploring one of the secondary characters of their run.  Several years after leaving, Ennis briefly returned for the five-part ''Son of Man'' story with artist [[John Higgins (comics)|John Higgins]].

Ennis' landmark work to date is the 66-issue epic ''[[Preacher (comic)|Preacher]]'', which he co-created with artist [[Steve Dillon]].  Running from [[1995 in comics|1995]] to [[2000 in comics|2000]], it was a tale of a [[preacher]] with [[supernatural]] powers, searching (literally) for [[God]] who has abandoned [[Earth|his creation]].  Mixing influences from [[western movie]]s and religious themes, it drew plaudits for Ennis from all sections of the media; the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' newspaper voted one of the ''Preacher'' collections its ''book of the week'', and [[film director]] [[Kevin Smith]] described it as "More fun than going to the movies."

While ''[[Preacher (comic)|Preacher]]'' was running, Ennis began a series set in the [[DC Comics|DC]] universe called ''[[Hitman (comics)|Hitman]]''.  Despite being lower profile than ''[[Preacher (comic)|Preacher]]'', ''[[Hitman (comics)|Hitman]]'' ran for 60 issues (plus specials) from [[1996 in comics|1996]] to [[2001 in comics|2001]], veering wildly from violent action to humour to an examination of male friendship under fire.

Other comic projects Ennis wrote during this time period include ''[[Goddess (Vertigo)|Goddess]]'', ''[[Bloody Mary (Helix)|Bloody Mary]]'', ''[[The Unknown Soldier (comics)|Unknown Soldier]]'', and ''[[Pride & Joy (Vertigo)|Pride & Joy]]'', all for DC/Vertigo, as well as origin stories for ''[[The Darkness (comics)|The Darkness]]'' for [[Image Comics]] and ''[[Shadowman (comics)|Shadowman]]'' for [[Valiant Comics]].

After the end of ''Hitman'', Ennis was lured to Marvel Comics with the promise from Editor-in-Chief [[Joe Quesada]] that he could write ''The [[Punisher]]'' as long as he cared to.  The initial 12-issue maxi-series was illustrated by Steve Dillon, who also did a 37-issue series (even illustrating it and co-writing an issue while Ennis briefly stepped down as writer) which only ended when Ennis decided to change direction.  Instead of largely comical tone of these issues, he decided to make a much more serious series, re-launched under Marvel's [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] [[imprint]].  This run has inspired several limited series (such as ''Born'' and ''Barracuda'') and one-shots (''The End'', ''The Cell'', and ''The Tyger'').  The creators of the new Punisher movie, [[Punisher: War Zone]], have attributed Ennis's Punisher MAX run as one of the major influences for that film.<ref>[http://insidepulse.com/article.php?contentid=20202 ''Wizard''.] Molino, Rachel. "'Punisher: War Zone' Q&A with Ray Stevenson." December 8, 2008.</ref> While at Marvel, Ennis also wrote stories for ''[[Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]'', ''[[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'', and ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]''.

In [[2001 in comics|2001]] he briefly returned to UK comics to write the epic ''[[Helter Skelter (Judge Dredd story)|Helter Skelter]]'' for ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' - this series cannot be considered a success, with Ennis himself saying that there is "not a hope" to return to writing Dredd as he was generally not happy with his run.  "I<U+2019>m too close to Dredd, I like him too much. I can<U+2019>t tamper with the formula; nor can I take the piss the way I do with superheroes," he said.<ref>Will Cooling, [http://insidepulse.com/2004/08/16/20202/ Caught in the Nexus: Garth Ennis], August 16, 2004</ref>

Other comics Ennis has written include  ''[[War Story]]'' (with various artists) for DC; ''[[The Pro (comics)|The Pro]]'' for [[Image Comics]]; ''[[The Authority]]'' for [[Wildstorm]]; ''Just a Pilgrim'' for Black Bull Press, and ''[[303 (comic book series)|303]]'', ''[[Chronicles of Wormwood]]'' (a six issue mini-series about the [[Antichrist]]), and a [[Western (genre)|western]] [[comic book]], ''[[Streets of Glory]]'' for [[Avatar Press]].<ref>[http://www.comicsbulletin.com/rage/118515260256692.htm Interview with Ennis about ''Streets of Glory''], [[Comics Bulletin]]</ref>

His work has won him a good deal of recognition in the comics industry, including nominations for the [[Comics Buyer's Guide]] Award for Favorite Writer in 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000.

Unexpectedly, in [[2006 in comics|2006]], it was announced that Ennis would write a new creator-owned extended series titled ''[[The Boys (comics)|The Boys]]'', originally published by Wildstorm. After just six issues, ''The Boys'' was cancelled by Wildstorm.  Ennis later explained that this was because DC Comics (of whom Wildstorm was an imprint before it was dissbanded) were uneasy with the anti-superhero tone of the work. The series was picked up by Dynamite Entertainment, and is now ongoing.  ''The Boys'' sees Ennis reunited with artist [[Darick Robertson]], the two had previously worked together on the Marvel series ''Fury: Peacemaker'' and ''Punisher: Born''.  ''The Boys'' is expected to run for sixty issues.

Ennis wrote the first arc of WildStorm's ''[[Midnighter]]'' (a spin-off of ''[[The Authority]]'') and one stand alone issue before leaving the title. Ennis has also worked with [[John Woo]] on a 5-issue comic book mini-series called ''[[Seven Brothers (comic book)|Seven Brothers]]'' for [[Virgin Comics]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060902235153/http://www.newsarama.com/virgincomics/7Bros/7Ennis.html Garth Ennis on ''Seven Brothers''], interview with [[Newsarama]]</ref>

In [[2008 in comics|2008]] Ennis ended his five-year run on ''Punisher'' MAX to debut a new Marvel title, ''[[War Is Hell (comics)|War Is Hell]]: The First Flight of the [[Phantom Eagle]]''. The limited series, with artist [[Howard Chaykin]], features the little-used character [[Phantom Eagle]], a WWI pilot who originally appeared in Marvel Comics during the 1960s.<ref name="forum.newsarama.com">[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=142228 Nick Lowe on Marvel Max's ''War is Hell'' series], Newsarama, January 7, 2008</ref><ref name=PW021908>Laura Hudson, [http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6533463.html Ennis Moves from Punisher to Phantom Eagle], ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', February 19, 2008</ref> In 2008, Ennis also wrote a new ''[[Dan Dare]]'' miniseries published by [[Virgin Comics]].

In June 2008, at Wizard World, [[Philadelphia]], Ennis announced several new projects, including a [[metaseries]] of war comics called ''[[Battlefields (comics)|Battlefields]]''<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=16640 WW Philly: Ennis Tells Dynamite Stories of "Battlefields"], [[Comic Book Resources]], June 1, 2008</ref><ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=158881 WW Philly: Garth Ennis Brings War Stories to Dynamite], Newsarama, June 1, 2008</ref> from Dynamite made up of mini-series including ''Night Witches'',<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080818-Ennis-Battlefields.html Garth Ennis on Battlefields: Night Witches], Newsarama, August 15, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17795 Garth Ennis Takes to the "Battlefields"], Comic Book Resources, August 21, 2008</ref> ''Dear Billy''<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18943 Garth Ennis Writes To <U+201C>Dear Billy<U+201D>], Comic Book Resources, November 25, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/100828-Ennis-Battlefields.html Ennis & His Editor - Talking Battlefields and War Comics], Newsarama, November 28, 2008</ref> and ''Tankies'',<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/020920-Ennis-Tankies.html Garth Ennis on Battlefields: The Tankies], Newsarama, February 20, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20217 Garth Ennis Talks "Battlefields: The Tankies"], Comic Book Resources, February 27, 2009</ref> another ''Chronicles of Wormwood'' mini-series and ''[[Crossed (comics)|Crossed]]''<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=16780 Double-Crossed: Ennis & Burrows talk <U+201C>Crossed<U+201D>], Comic Book Resources, June 12, 2008</ref> both at Avatar, a six-issue miniseries about Butcher (from ''The Boys'') and a Punisher project reuniting him with artist Steve Dillon (subsequently specified to be a weekly mini-series entitled ''[[Punisher: War Zone (comics)|Punisher: War Zone]],'' to be released concurrently with [[Punisher: War Zone|the film of the same name]]).<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=158898 WW PHILLY: THE GARTH ENNIS PANEL], Newsarama, June 1, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17971 Ma's Home!
