The '''''Batman'' film series''' consists of six [[superhero film]]s based on the [[DC Comics]] [[Batman|character of the same name]]. The films have been financed and distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] Pictures. In the film series, Batman has been portrayed by [[Michael Keaton]] (''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', ''[[Batman Returns]]''), [[Val Kilmer]] (''[[Batman Forever]]''), [[George Clooney]] (''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'') and [[Christian Bale]] (''[[Batman Begins]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'').

==Development==
In the late 1970s, Batman's popularity was waning.<ref name=CBS/> [[CBS]] was interested in producing a ''Batman in Outer Space'' film. Producers [[Michael Uslan]] and [[Benjamin Melniker]] purchased the [[film rights]] of Batman from [[DC Comics]] in April 1979. It was Uslan's wish "to make the definitive, dark, serious version of Batman, the way [[Bob Kane]] and [[Bill Finger]] had envisioned him in 1939. A creature of the night; stalking criminals in the shadows."<ref name=CBS>{{cite news | author = Bill "Jett Ramey | url = http://www.batman-on-film.com/interview_muslan_2.html | title = An Interview With Michael Uslan - Part 1 | work = Batman-on-Film | date = 2005-11-08 | accessdate = 2008-05-04}}</ref> [[Richard Maibaum]] was approached to write a script with [[Guy Hamilton]] to direct, but the two turned down the offer. Uslan was unsuccessful with [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]]ing ''Batman'' to various movie studios because they wanted the film to be similar to the [[camp (style)|camp]]y [[Batman (TV series)|1960s TV series]]. [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[United Artists]] were among those to turn down the film.<ref name=Columbia>{{cite news | author = Bill "Jett" Ramey | url = http://www.batman-on-film.com/interview_muslan_3.html | title = An Interview With Michael Uslan - Part 2 | work = Batman-on-Film | date = 2005-11-11 | accessdate = 2008-05-04}}</ref> 

A disappointed Uslan then wrote a script titled ''Return of the Batman'' to give the film industry a better idea of his vision for the film. Uslan later compared its dark tone to that of ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns|The Dark Knight Returns]]'', which his script pre-dated by six years.<ref name=CBS/> In November 1979, producers [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]] joined the project.<ref name=Guber>{{cite book | author = Nancy Griffin; Kim Masters | title = Hit & Run: How Jon Peters and Peter Guber Took Sony For A Ride In Hollywood | publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] | date =1997| location = | pages =158-174 | id = ISBN 0-684-80931-1 | chapter = Hit Men}}</ref> The four producers felt it was best to pattern the film's development after that of ''[[Superman (film)|Superman]]'' (1978).<ref name=production>{{cite news | author = Alan Jones | title = ''Batman'' in Production | publisher = [[Cinefantastique]] | pages=75-88 | date = November 1989 | accessdate = 2008-05-13}}</ref> Uslan, Melniker and Guber pitched ''Batman'' to [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], but the studio turned it down.<ref name=road>[[Michael Uslan]], [[Benjamin Melniker]], [[Peter Guber]], [[Tom Mankiewicz]], [[Sam Hamm]], ''Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight&mdash;The Road to Gotham City'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref> Though no movie studios were yet involved, in late 1981 the project was publicly announced with a budget of $15 million.

Christopher Nolan reprised his duties as director, and brought his brother, [[Jonathan Nolan|Jonathan]], to co-write the script.

On January 22, 2008, after he had completed filming ''The Dark Knight'', Ledger died of a sleeping pill overdose, leading to intense attention from the press and more people showing interest in the film. [[Warner Bros.]] had created a [[viral marketing]] campaign for ''The Dark Knight'', developing promotional websites and trailers highlighting screen shots of Ledger as the Joker, but after Ledger's death, the studio refocused its promotional campaign.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Marshall Crook; Peter Sanders|title=Advertising: Will Marketing Change After Star's Death?|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120113527501911813.html|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=2008-01-24|accessdate=2008-06-04|pages=B1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/24/ledger.films/index.html?iref=mpstoryview|title=Ledger's Death Puts Last Films in a Bind|work=[[CNN]]|date=[[2008-01-24]]|accessdate=2008-07-10}}</ref> The film was released on July 16, 2008; prior to its [[box office]] debut in North America, record numbers of advance tickets were sold for ''The Dark Knight''.
