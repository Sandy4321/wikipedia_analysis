'''Kumquats''' are a group of small fruit-bearing [[tree]]s in the [[flowering plant]] family [[Rutaceae]], either forming the genus ''Fortunella'', or placed within ''[[Citrus]] sensu lato''. The edible [[fruit]] closely resembles that of the [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] (''Citrus sinensis''), but is much smaller and oval, being approximately the size and shape of an [[olive]].

They are slow-growing [[evergreen]] [[shrub]]s or short [[tree]]s, from {{convert|2.5|to|4.5|m|ft|0}} tall, with sparse branches, sometimes bearing small [[Spine (botany)|thorn]]s. The [[leaf|leaves]] are dark glossy green, and the [[flower]]s pure yellow, similar to other citrus flowers, borne singly or clustered in the leaf-[[axil]]s. The kumquat tree produces 30 to 50 fruit each year.{{Dubious|date=March 2010}} The tree can be [[Aquatic plant|hydrophytic]], with the fruit often found floating on water near shore during the ripe season. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

The plant is native to [[south Asia]] and the [[Asia-Pacific]]. The earliest historical reference to kumquats appears in [[literature]] of [[China]] in the 12th century. They have long been cultivated in [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], the [[Philippines]] and [[southeast Asia]]. They  were introduced to [[Europe]] in 1846 by [[Robert Fortune]], collector for the [[London Horticultural Society]], and shortly thereafter into [[North America]].

The English word <i>kumquat</i> is derived from Cantonese (see 'Etymology,' below).

==Classification==
[[Carl Peter Thunberg]] originally classified the kumquats as ''Citrus japonica'' in his 1784 book [[Flora Japonica]].  In 1915 [[Walter Tennyson Swingle|Walter T. Swingle]] reclassified them in a segregate genus, ''Fortunella'', named in honor of Robert Fortune. 6 species of ''Fortunella'' have generally been recognised - ''F. japonica'', ''F. margarita'', ''F. crassifolia'', ''F. hindsii'', ''F. obovata'' and ''F. polyandra''. ''The Flora of China'' returns the kumquat to ''Citrus'' and combines the species into the single species ''Citrus japonica''.<ref>Zhang Dianxiang, Thomas G. Hartley, David J. Mabberley, Rutaceae in Flora of China 11: 51-97 (2008)</ref>
==Varieties==
===Round Kumquat===
The Round Kumquat (also '''Marumi Kumquat''' or '''Morgani Kumquat''') is an evergreen tree, producing edible golden-yellow colored fruit. The fruit is small and usually round but can be oval shaped. The peel has a sweet flavor but the fruit has a sour center. The fruit can be eaten raw but is mainly used to make marmalade and jelly. It is grown as an ornamental plant and can be used in bonsai. This plant symbolizes good luck in China and other Asian countries, where it is sometimes given as a gift during the [[Lunar New Year]]. It's more commonly cultivated than most other kumquats as it is cold tolerant. It can be kept as a houseplant.

When the kumquats are divided into multiple species the name ''Fortunella japonica'' (''Citrus japonica'') is retained by this group.

===Oval Kumquat===
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}
===Hong Kong Kumquat===
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}
===Jiangsu Kumquat===
The Jiangsu Kumquat or '''Fukushu Kumquat''' bears edible fruit that can be eaten raw. The fruit can be made into jelly and marmalade. The fruit can be round or bell shaped, it's bright orange when fully ripe. It may also be distinguished from other kumquats by its round leaves that make this species unique within the genus. It is grown for its edible fruit and as an ornamental plant. It cannot withstand frost.

When the kumquats are divided into multiple species the name ''Fortunella obovata'' (''Citrus obovata'') is used for this group.

==Cultivation and uses==
Kumquats are cultivated in China, [[South Korea]], [[North Korea]], Taiwan, [[Southeast Asia]], [[Japan]], the [[Middle East]], [[Europe]] (notably [[Corfu]], [[Greece]]), southern [[Pakistan]], and the southern United States (notably Florida, Louisiana and California). 

They are much [[hardiness (plants)|hardier]] than other citrus plants such as [[orange (fruit)|oranges]]. The 'Nagami' kumquat requires a hot summer, ranging from 25<U+00B0>C to 38<U+00B0>C (77<U+00B0> to 100<U+00B0>F), but can withstand frost down to about {{convert|-10|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} without injury. They grow in the tea hills of Hunan, China, where the climate is too cold for other citrus fruits, even the [[Mikan]] (also known as the Satsuma) orange. The trees differ also from other citrus species in that they enter into a period of winter dormancy so profound that they will remain in it through several weeks of subsequent warm weather without putting out new shoots or blossoms. Despite their ability to survive low temperatures, kumquat trees grow better and produce larger and sweeter fruits in warmer regions.

===Uses===
[[File:KoumQuatLiqueur.jpg|thumb|Koum Quat [[liqueur]]s from [[Corfu]], [[Greece]]]]
Kumquats are often eaten raw. As the rind is sweet and the juicy centre is sour and salty, the raw fruit is usually consumed either whole<U+2014>to savour the contrast<U+2014>or only the rind is eaten. The fruit is considered ripe when it reaches a yellowish-orange stage and has just shed the last tint of green.

Culinary uses include candying and kumquat preserves, [[marmalade]], and [[Jelly (fruit preserves)|jelly]]. Kumquats can also be sliced and added to salads. In recent years kumquats have gained popularity as a [[garnish]] for [[cocktail]] beverages, including the [[martini]] as a replacement for the more familiar olive. A kumquat [[liqueur]] mixes the fruit with [[vodka]] or other clear spirit.

The [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] often preserve kumquats in [[salt]] or sugar. A batch of the fruit is buried in dry salt inside a [[glass]] jar. Over time, all the juice from the fruit is [[diffusion|diffused]] into the salt.  The fruit in the jar becomes shrunken, wrinkled, and dark brown in colour, and the salt combines with the juice to become a dark brown [[brine]]. A few salted kumquats with a few teaspoons of the brine/juice may be mixed with hot water to make a remedy for sore throats.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} A jar of such preserved kumquats can last several years and still keep its taste.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In the [[Philippines]] and [[Taiwan]] kumquats are a popular addition to [[green tea]] and [[black tea]], either hot or iced.

In [[Vietnam]], kumquat [[bonsai]] trees (round kumquat plant) are used as a decoration for the [[T<U+1EBF>t]] (Lunar New Year) holiday. Kumquat fruits are also boiled or dried to make a candied snack called ''m<U+1EE9>t qu<U+1EA5>t''.

Variants of the kumquat are grown specially in [[India]].

==Composition==
[[Image:Heidi kumquat.JPG|thumb|left|Morgach kumquat fruit]]
The [[essential oil]] of kumquat peel contains much of the aroma of the fruit, and is composed principally of [[limonene]], which makes up around 93% of the total.<ref name="KoyasakoBernhard">{{cite journal|last=Koyasako, A|coauthors=Bernhard, R.A. |year=1983|title=Volatile Constituents of the Essential Oil of Kumquat|journal=Journal of Food Science|publisher=Wiley & Sons|volume=48|issue=6|pages=1807<U+2013>1812|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119541583/abstract|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.1983.tb05090.x|first1=A.}}</ref>.   Besides limonene and [[alpha-Pinene]] (0.34%), both [[monoterpene]]s, the oil is unusually rich (0.38% total) in [[sesquiterpene]]s such as <U+03B1>-[[bergamotene]] (0.021%), [[caryophyllene]] (0.18%), <U+03B1>-[[humulene]] (0.07%) and <U+03B1>-[[muurolene]] (0.06%), and these contribute to the spicy and woody flavour of the fruit.  [[Carbonyl]] compounds make up much of the remainder, and these are responsible for much of the distinctive flavour; these compounds include [[ester]]s such as [[isopropyl propanoate]] (1.8%) and [[terpinyl acetate]] (1.26%); [[ketone]]s such as [[carvone]] (0.175%); and a range of [[aldehyde]]s such as [[citronellal]] (0.6%) and [[2-Methylundecanal|2-methylundecanal]].  Other oxygenated compounds include [[nerol]] (0.22%) and trans-[[linalool oxide]] (0.15%).<ref name="KoyasakoBernhard"/>

==Etymology==
[[Image:Quinotos.jpg|thumb|right|Kumquat fruit cross-section]]
The English name "kumquat" derives from the [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] word ''gam1 gwat1'' (given in [[Jyutping]] [[romanization]]; {{zh|c=[[wiktionary:<U+91D1>|<U+91D1>]][[wiktionary:<U+6A58>|<U+6A58>]]|p=j<U+012B>nj<U+00FA>|l=golden orange}}). Cantonese speakers more often write the word today as [[wiktionary:<U+67D1>|<U+67D1>]][[wiktionary:<U+6A58>|<U+6A58>]], also pronounced ''gam1 gwat1'' (''g<U+0101>n j<U+00FA>'' in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]], literally "large tangerine orange"). 

Names in other Asian languages include:
*[[Japanese language|Japanese]]: ''kinkan'' ([[wikt:<U+91D1><U+67D1>|<U+91D1><U+67D1>]])
*[[Korean language|Korean]]: ''geumgyul'' (<U+AE08><U+ADE4>, <U+91D1><U+6A58>)
*[[Southern Min Language|Hokkien]]: ''g<U+012B>m-gam'' ({{zh|t=<U+91D1><U+67D1>}})
*[[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]: ''j<U+012B>nj<U+00FA>'' ([[wikt:<U+91D1><U+6A58>|<U+91D1><U+6A58>]])
*[[Nepali language|Nepali]]: ''muntala''
*[[Thai language|Thai]]: ''somch<U+00ED>d'' (<U+0E2A><U+0E49><U+0E21><U+0E08><U+0E35><U+0E4A><U+0E14>)
*[[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: at least three dialect terms are used. In southern Vietnam the fruit is generally known as ''t<U+1EAF>c'', in central Vietnam as ''kim qu<U+1EA5>t'', and in northern Vietnam as ''qu<U+1EA5>t'' (for ''Round Kumquat'') (not be confused with the bird named "qu<U+1ED1>c" or "cu<U+1ED1>c") and ''qu<U+1EA5>t ng<U+1ECD>t'' (for ''Oval Kumquat'').

==Hybrids and Homophones==
[[Hybrid]] forms of the kumquat include the following.
*[[Limequat]] - lime + kumquat
*[[Orangequat]] - Satsuma mandarin + kumquat
*[[Calamondin]] - tangerine + kumquat 
*[[Citrangequat]] - citrange + kumquat
*Procimequat - limequat + kumquat
*[[Sunquat]] - lemon + kumquat 
*[[Yuzuquat]] - yuzu + kumquat

Though [[loquat]]s are not related botanically to kumquats, the terms originate in the same Chinese word designating "orange."
