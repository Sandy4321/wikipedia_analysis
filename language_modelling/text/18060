The '''Caproni Ca 335 Maestrale''' ([[Mistral (wind)|Mistral]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] single-engined two-seat fighter-bomber/[[Surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance]] aircraft of the 1930s.  It was designed by [[Caproni]] to meet a requirement of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Belgian Air Component|Air Force]], with it being planned that the aircraft would be built under licence by the Belgian company [[SABCA]] as the '''SABCA S.47'''.  Only a single aircraft was built, production plans being stopped by the [[Battle of Belgium|German invasion of Belgium]] in May 1940.

==Development and design==
In October 1937, the Belgian aircraft manufacturer [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Anonyme Belge de Constructions A<U+00E9>ronautiques]] (SABCA) made a marketing agreement with the Italian company [[Caproni]], with SABCA selling some of Caproni's military aircraft in certain markets, including the [[Caproni Ca 135]], [[Caproni Ca 310|Ca 310]] and the [[Caproni Ca.313|Ca 312]], which were to be designated SABCA S.45bis, S.46 and S.48 respectively.  As part of this agreement, Caproni were to develop a replacement for the Belgium Air Force's [[Fairey Fox]] [[biplane]]s, which were used as two-seat fighters and reconnaissance aircraft, but were obsolete.<ref name="Green v7 p38"> Green 1967, p.38.</ref>  

The task of designing the new type for SABCA, the Caproni Ca 335 Maestrale, was given to Chief Engineer [[Cesare Pallavicino]],<ref name="baha s47"> Bergmann, Holger. "[http://www.baha.be/Webpages/Navigator/Photos/MilltaryPics/interbellum/sabca_s_47.htm Sabca S 47]". ''[[http://www.baha.be/ Belgian Aviation History Association]]''. 7 May 2008. Retrieved 18 January 2010.</ref> who based the design on his earlier [[Caproni A.P.1|A.P.1]] attack aircraft.<ref name="Green v7 p38"/> It was a low-winged [[Cantilever#In_aircraft|cantilever]] [[monoplane]] of mixed construction, with a metal skinned steel-tube fuselage and wood and fabric wings, powered by a single [[Hispano-Suiza 12Y]]crs [[V12 engine]].  It had a hydraulically-actuated retractable [[conventional landing gear|tailwheel undercarriage]], with the mainwheels retracting backwards into the wing.  The pilot and observer were provided with individual, widely separated cockpits, with the observer having defensive armament of a single machine gun, and the pilot firing a [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404]] ''moteur-canon'' firing through the propeller hub and two wing mounted machine-guns, while a small bomb-bay housed two 50&nbsp;kg (110&nbsp;lb) bombs, while a further ten 50&nbsp;kg (22&nbsp;lb) bombs could be carried under the wings.<ref name="Green v7 p38-9"> Green 1967, pp. 38<U+2013>39.</ref><ref name="baha s47"/>

The Ca 337 prototype was built at Caproni's [[Ponte San Pietro]] factory, making its maiden flight there on 16 February 1939.<ref name="baha s47"/>  It was then dismantled and sent to SABCA's factory at [[Brussels]] by train. After re-assembly, it flew again on 19 September 1939. Initial testing was successful, resulting in SABCA purchasing a license for manufacture of the Ca 335, and demonstrating it, now designated SABCA S.47, to officials of the Belgian Ministry of Defence and representatives of a number of other nations.  While the Belgian Air Force were impressed by the S.47, and had a requirement for 24 of them, SABCA's factory was busy with orders for 41 [[Breguet 693]]s for the Belgian Air Force and for France, and 10 [[Koolhoven F.K.58]]s for France, delaying a formal order being placed.<ref name="Green v7 p39-0"> Green 1967, pp. 39<U+2013>40.</ref>  

On 14 March 1940, the prototype was being demonstrated to the French ''[[Armee de l'Air]]'' st [[Orl<U+00E9>ans]] when it was damaged in a minor landing accident. It had not been repaired when the [[Battle of France|Germans invaded France and the Low Countries]], stopping SABCA's production plans. The prototype S.47 was captured by the advancing German forces on 13 June 1940.  Attempts by Caproni to reclaim the S.47 were unsuccessful, it remaining in France until 1943, eventually being scrapped.<ref name="baha s47"/><ref name="Green v7 p39"> Green 1967, p.39.</ref>
