Injured for most of the 2004 season, Valverde managed to appear in only 29 games.

====2005====
He gained the Diamondbacks [[closer (baseball)|closer]] role after replacing [[Brian Bruney]] in 2005. He ended the season with a 2.44 ERA and 15 saves in 61 games.

====2006====
Valverde had some troubles in June 2006, and management sent him to the Diamondbacks' [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] affiliate, the [[Tucson Sidewinders]]. He returned to the closer role in early September and pitched well in his return. Valverde finished the 2006 season with a record of two [[win (baseball)|wins]], three [[loss (baseball)|losses]], an [[earned run average|ERA]] of 5.84 and 18 [[save (baseball)|saves]].

====2007====

==Pitching style==
[[File:Valverde pitching motion.png|thumb|right|Valverde's pitching motion from 2010]]

Valverde throws just two pitches, a [[four-seam fastball]] (93<U+2013>96&nbsp;mph) and a [[forkball]] (84<U+2013>87). He throws a slightly higher percentage of forkballs to left-handed hitters. He is comfortable using the pitch in almost all counts, although he throws it most often when it is 0<U+2013>2 or 1<U+2013>2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brooksbaseball.net/player_cards/player_card.php?player=407878|title=Brooks Baseball <U+00B7> Home of the PitchFX Tool <U+2013> Player Card: Jose Valverde|publisher=Brooks Baseball|accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref> Valverde's control is sometimes spotty, as he has an above average career rate of 3.9 [[base on balls|walks]] per nine innings.<ref>http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=pit&lg=all&qual=0&type=1&season=2011&month=0&season1=1901&ind=0&team=0,ss&rost=0&players=0&sort=0,d</ref> This balances a dominating 10.3 [[strikeouts]] per nine innings ratio.<ref name= "BREF" />

Valverde is also known for his energetic, highly emotional style on the mound. He frequently celebrates outs and saves very demonstratively. Some have questioned the sportsmanship of his behavior, including former teammate [[Miguel Montero]] of the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] who has called him "unprofessional".<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jspymd=20100620&content_id=11389732&notebook_id=11394516&vkey=notebook_ari&fext=.jsp&c_id=ari Ex-mates Montero, Valverde trade barbs] MLB.com June 20, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.azcentral.com/sports/diamondbacks/articles/2010/06/20/20100620tigers-valverde-rips-diamondbacks-montero.html Jose Valverde rips Miguel Montero, blasts Diamondbacks] ''Arizona Now'' June 20, 2010</ref>
