A G N Kazi started his career as Assistant Commissioner in Bihar and Orissa but opted for Pakistan during the partition of India in 1947. He joined the Government of Sindh and held pivotal positions such as Secretary to Governor and Secretary Finance.

In 1969 he was appointed Secretary for Industries and Natural Resources and a year later as Finance Secretary of the Government of [[Pakistan]]. As Secretary Finance he succeeded eminent personalities such as Sir Victor Turner, Abdul Qadir, Mumtaz Hasan Hafiz Abdul Majid and M M Ahmed. He held this pivotal assignment during the unfortunate crisis of 1971.

In 1994, A G N Kazi finally retired after fifty long years of service and never took up any regular government assignment.
