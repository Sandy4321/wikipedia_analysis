'''Gnangara Road''' is an arterial east-west road in [[Perth]], [[Australia]]. It is located within the northern suburbs of Perth, from [[Madeley, Western Australia|Madeley]] in the west, to [[Henley Brook, Western Australia|Henley Brook]] in the east. Gnangara Road provides a connection between [[Great Northern Highway]] (via [[West Swan Road]]) and [[Wanneroo Road]]. The construction of the [[Ocean Reef Road]] extension in 2011 altered the road network in the Landsdale area  in [[Landsdale, Western Australia|Landsdale]].<ref name=WannerooRoads>{{cite web|title=Roads|url=http://www.wanneroo.wa.gov.au/Council/Capital_Works/Roads|work=Capital Works|publisher=City of Wanneroo|accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref> The plans show Gnangara Road as discontinuous between Mirrabooka Avenue and [[Alexander Drive]], with the Mirrabooka Avenue and Ocean Reef Road extensions linking the two sections. Following construction, those linking road sections were named as Gnangara Road, allowing the road to remain continuous.

==History==
{{expand section|history prior to 2012|date=January 2013}}
Gnangara Road was upgraded to a four lane dual carriage way between Drumpellier Drive and Pinaster Parade, near [[Ellenbrook, Western Australia|Ellenbrook]]. The works began in May 2012, and included traffic lights at the intersection of Gnangara Road and Drumpellier Drive, drainage, and kerbing.<ref>{{cite news|title=Four-lane carriageway|url=http://www.inmycommunity.com.au/news-and-views/local-news/Four-lane-carriageway/7623249/|accessdate=12 June 2012|date=23 May 2012|newspaper=Community Newspaper Group}}</ref> The upgrade works were completed on schedule, in December 2012, at a cost of more the $3.3 million.<ref name=GRcash>{{cite news|last=Frank|first=Caroline|title=Gnangara Road cash promised|url=http://www.inmycommunity.com.au/news-and-views/local-news/Gnangara-Road-cash-promised/7625520/|accessdate=3 July 2012|newspaper=The Advocate|date=27 June 2012}}</ref><ref name="New-carriageway">{{cite news|last=Miles|first=Stephen|title=New carriageway will improve traffic flow|url=http://www.inmycommunity.com.au/news-and-views/local-news/New-carriageway-will-improve-traffic-flow/7638640/|accessdate=24 January 2013|newspaper=The Advocate|date=9 January 2013}}</ref>

Due to the resulting works of the [[Ocean Reef Road]] extension Gnangara Road has been removed as being state route 83 and has now been reassigned as state route 84 from the Ocean Reef Road intersection with Sydney Road to [[West Swan Road]].

==Future Works==
Gnangara Road in the [[City of Swan]] is planned to ultimately be upgraded to a six lane dual carriage road between Alexander Drive and Beechboro Road North, and a four lane dual carriage road between Beechboro Road North and Pinaster Parade.<ref name=FundsForRoad>{{cite news|title=Funds sought for road|url=http://eastern.inmycommunity.com.au/news-and-views/local-news/Funds-sought-for-road/7563587/|accessdate=12 June 2012|date=28 July 2010|newspaper=Community Newspaper Group}}</ref>

The state government has committed $6.6 million to construct a second carriageway between [[Beechboro Road|Beechboro Road North]] and Drumpellier Drive, and an additional $14 million to complete the remaining {{convert|7.9|km}} up to Alexander Drive between 2013 and 2015.<ref name="New-carriageway" /> The works will include installing traffic lights will be constructed at the intersection with [[Beechboro Road|Beechboro Road North]],<ref name="New-carriageway" /><ref name=HillsGaz /> which was the site of 131 accidents during the five-year period to 2010,<ref name=FundsForRoad /> and rated fifth in the [[RACWA|RAC]]<U+2019>s 2012 list of Western Australia<U+2019>s worst intersections.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gnangara sweetener|url=http://www.inmycommunity.com.au/news-and-views/local-news/Gnangara-sweetener/7636457/|accessdate=24 January 2013|newspaper=Community Newspaper Group|date=28 November 2012}}</ref>

It was announced in April 2012 that a single lane roundabout will be constructed at Gnangara Road's eastern terminus with West Swan Road and Henry Street. Construction works will begin after the relocation of water and electrical services, and are expected to take 12 to 15 months.<ref name=HillsGaz>{{cite news|last=Frank|first=Caroline|title=New Gnangara-West Swan roundabout announced|url=http://hills.inmycommunity.com.au/news-and-views/local-news/New-Gnangara-West-Swan-roundabout-announced/7618365/|accessdate=12 June 2012|newspaper=Hills Gazette|date=05 Apr 2012}}</ref>
