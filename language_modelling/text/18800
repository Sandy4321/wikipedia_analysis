'''''Holmes on Homes''''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[television series]] airing on [[HGTV Canada|Home & Garden Television]] in Canada, and also on several other [[Alliance Atlantis]] networks in Canada (including [[BBC Canada]] and [[Life Network]]), as well as in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], and on [[Discovery Home]] in the [[United States]].  It has been consistently the highest-rated show on the Canadian HGTV (HGTV having once claimed that an episode had gotten its highest-ever ratings), with shows airing upwards of 20 times a week at the peak of its popularity.  It has won the [[Gemini Awards|Gemini]] viewer's choice award, a testament to the popularity of the show in Canada.

Originally, ''Holmes on Homes'' ran as a series of 30-minute episodes (with one one-hour special ''Whole House Disaster''), but moved to a one-hour format midway through the third season due to popular demand.  Several longer specials have aired: the one-hour season finale to the first season ''Whole House Disaster'', the one-hour ''Holmes for the Holidays'' at the end of the third season, the two-hour ''House to Home'' season finale for the fourth season, and the two-hour specials ''Out of the Ashes'' and ''Holmes Inspection'' in the fifth season.  To date, only half-hour episodes from the first two seasons are available outside Canada, although the latest episode is available for viewing on HGTV's website[http://www.hgtv.ca/microsites/holmesonhomes/video/].  As of the fall of 2006, the show is in its sixth season.  In Canada, the first four seasons of half-hour and hour long episodes are also available on DVD.

Mike has also appeared on the [[Ellen Degeneres]] show. In her characteristic exuberance, Ellen mock [http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/artslife/story.html?id=e48d5b94-6884-4fc8-93ce-2504836214af&k=76103&p=1 proposed] to Mike during his first appearance on [[October 4]], [[2006]][http://www.680news.com/news/local/article.jsp?content=20061004_134658_2848]. He appeared again on her [[October 6]], 2006 show to introduce a young couple whose home renovation project had gone very wrong. At his [[December 7]], 2006 appearance, Mike brought an update on the young couple's home (complete with photos).

==Premise==
The show's premise revolves around [[general contractor]] [[Mike Holmes]] visiting homeowners in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] who have had less than impressive previous renovation experiences (on one occasion, Holmes looks at the issue of [[mould]] in the household, and no previous contractors were involved).  The typical episode has homeowners describing their experiences with the previous contractor, and Holmes showing some of the flaws in the previous work.  The previous work is often substandard, and in many cases, contrary to [[building code]]s.  Typically, after beginning the repair work, Holmes and his crew of contractors often find that their small repair project has escalated into a larger one due to surprises that they find and are forced to fix; only on rare occasions have the show's crew ''not'' been forced to tear everything down and start over.  However, in the end, Holmes presents the homeowners with a completely finished place, often with a few extra surprises.  Throughout the rebuilding process, Holmes often comments on the professionalism of the people hired for the job or lets other contractors talk about how to build things correctly - on some occasions Holmes has vented out his frustrations in front of the camera.

Because of the show being a television series, costs for the homeowners, who are likely to be strapped for cash due to the previous contractors, are kept to a minimum (often half of the regular cost of repair).  Some contractors hired on the show have even donated time, materials, and labor to help homeowners in need.

Throughout the series, Holmes also encourages viewers to be more vigilant of persons who may try to steal money through fraudulent contracting work, and gives out various pieces of advice on picking the right contractors, home inspectors, and other tradespersons.  Throughout the show, Holmes and company also show what to do and what not to do in the construction industry, especially for do-it-yourself renovators.

The show is not heavily sponsored by Home Depot, although many assume it incorrectly. They do not supply trailers, tools or materials to Holmes on Homes, nor any of its contractors. Mike Holmes is a consultant for their At Home services department and that is one of the only affiliations the show has with Home Depot, aside from DVD sales.  Most Canadian Home Depot stores sell [[DVD]]s of the show; as of this writing (early 2006) many Home Depots include a life-sized cardboard cutout of Mike Holmes with his arms crossed. 

Holmes on Homes gets their donated materials from many other companies interested in helping the show's cause. Not all materials are donated.

== History ==
Holmes originally was hired on ''Just ask Jon Eakes'', a home improvement show (also on HGTV) hosted by Jon Eakes, for some behind-the-scenes work. Mike Holmes approached the show's producers Scott Clark McNeil and Michael Quast with an idea for a new kind of home improvement show. Although submissions to be on the show were initially few and far between, with Holmes doing work on small botched jobs early on in the series, the number of submissions quickly ballooned by the show's fourth season. They are currently filming season 6 while taking submissions for Spring 2007's season 7.

== Construction crew ==
Although Holmes serves as the show's host, he brings with him several other equally skilled contractors who are regulars on the series (although not in all seasons):

* Damon Bennett - Damon was introduced in the fourth season of the series.

* Steve Buck - Steve became a series regular in the sixth season.
