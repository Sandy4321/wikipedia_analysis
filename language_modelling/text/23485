'''''Chocobo World''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|''Odekake Chokobo RPG''|<U+304A><U+3067><U+304B><U+3051><U+30C1><U+30E7><U+30B3><U+30DC>RPG|}} is a [[handheld electronic game]] developed by [[Square Co.]] (now [[Square Enix]]) for the [[PocketStation]] [[video game console]]. The game's data is stored on the [[compact disc]]s of ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'', which shares functionality with ''Chocobo World'' <U+2013> with features such as transferring [[Gil (Final Fantasy)|Gil]] (a currency) between the two fictional worlds.

It was present in all localizations of ''Final Fantasy VIII'', but the PocketStation was only released in [[Japan]] (the game's original locale).<ref>{{cite web | author=IGN staff | title=FFVIII PocketStation Opens Up Chocobo World | publisher=www.ign.com | year=July 15, 1999 | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/068/068855p1.html | accessdate=2006-07-18}}</ref> However, ''Chocobo World'' was later implemented into the [[personal computer]] [[game port|port]] of ''Final Fantasy VIII'', which was released in [[Japan]], [[North America]] and the [[PAL region]]. 

In ''Chocobo World'', the game player controls a Chicobo (a baby [[Chocobo]]) named Boko on his quest to save his friend Mog from the clutches of an evil demon. The game's presentation closely follows the "[[virtual pet]]" concept conceived by [[Bandai]]'s [[Tamagotchi]]. Players care for Boko with a focus on raising his experience through battling monsters; raising him in ''Chocobo World'' makes him a powerful ally to [[Final Fantasy magic#Summon Magic|summon]] in ''Final Fantasy VIII''.

==Gameplay==

{{seealso|Final Fantasy VIII#Gameplay}}
''Chocobo World'' is a [[console role playing game]] comprised of black and white [[pixel]] graphics. The game can be played exclusively, but is intended as a [[minigame]] to ''Final Fantasy VIII''.<ref name="guidecite">{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VIII North American instruction manual | pages=38-40 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts | language=English | id=SLUS-00892GH}}</ref> To play in conjunction with ''Final Fantasy VIII'', the player must find character Boko in the world of ''Final Fantasy VIII''. This accomplished, the player is permanently given a [[user interface]] for communicating between the two virtual worlds. Here the player may send Boko into ''Chocobo World'' to gain experience and collect items, which are transferred back to ''Final Fantasy VIII''.

===Exploration===
In ''Chocobo World'', Boko perpetually wanders around a nondescript landscape in search of "events" to interact with, such as enemy battles, friendly encounters with Moomba and Cactuar, and "special" events. Depending on how the player sets the "Move" option, Boko may break from his path to navigate to the nearest event perpendicular to his direction of travel. Players can also turn off the "Event Wait" option, eliminating the need for player input to advance, although choosing this option prevents Boko from encountering special events. At any time, players can intervene and halt Boko's [[Game AI|computer-controlled]] movement in favor of manually controlling him.

Events are shown on the map as black dots, while Boko's location is represented by a flickering black dot. When an event is cleared, it vanishes on the map, only to be replaced by another in a random location. When Boko gains a level of experience through battling enemies, the map resets and randomly redistributes events across the world.

===Battle system===
[[Image:Chocobo world screenshot blobra.png|thumb|right|Boko faces a [[Final_Fantasy_bestiary_(F-M)#Flan|Blobra]] on the battle screen]]
Battles are the most common event the player encounters in ''Chocobo World''. Upon confronting an enemy, the player is thrust into the battle screen. Once engaged in battle, the player's only option is to fight until either the enemy or Boko is defeated. Combatant health is represented by numerical "[[hit point]]s" (HP) displayed on the far sides of the playing screen; whoever's count of hit points reaches zero first loses the battle. Combat relies on a variant of the [[Active Time Battle]] (ATB) system featured in ''Final Fantasy VIII''. In battle, Boko and his opponent each have a time counter; the first combatant's counter to reach zero is allowed to attack, upon which both time counters reset and the process repeats itself. By alternately pressing the left and right buttons, players can speed up Boko's time counter, reducing the time required for him to attack. Upon winning a battle, Boko receives a magic stone which is randomly placed on a [[tic-tac-toe]]-style board. If three stones line up in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row, Boko gains a "level" of experience, which increases his hit point count in ''Chocobo World'' and his strength in ''Final Fantasy VIII''. If the player finds Mog within ''Chocobo World'', he will assist Boko in battle as a last resort, i.e., if Boko himself is defeated, Mog will attack the enemy (an attack analogous to the [[Limit Break]] in ''Final Fantasy'' games). If Mog's attack fails to defeat the enemy, he leaves his partner and Boko loses the battle. After losing any battle, Boko must rest to restore his hit points, but the player is allowed to continue the game without penalty for defeat.

In some events, Boko is approached by Moomba, who gives his friend a weapon. A weapon is simply a series of four numbers that determines Boko's attacking power. During battle, the computer randomly chooses one of the four digits on the weapon number to determine the damage Boko inflicts, or the number his attack subtracts from the enemy's hit point count. If, for example, the weapon is 8531, then Boko's damage dealt to the enemy will be randomly chosen from the digits "8," "5," "3," and "1."

Players can have their Chicobos battle each other using the PocketStation's [[optical communication]] function.<ref name="guidecite">{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Square Electronic Arts | title=Final Fantasy VIII North American instruction manual | pages=38-40 | publisher=Square Electronic Arts | language=English | id=SLUS-00892GH}}</ref> 

===Collecting items===
Another event in ''Chocobo World'' involves Cactuar finding items for Boko. Cactuar appears on the event screen and gives Boko one of four items, labeled A, B, C, and D. Although these items are useless in ''Chocobo World'', they can be "imported" to the world of ''Final Fantasy VIII'' to be accessed in the player's item inventory. Depending on the player's rank, the probability of Cactuar finding "D" rank items is greatest, but they are among the most common items in ''Final Fantasy VIII'' (e.g., basic [[List of items in Final Fantasy#Status recovery|status recovery]] items). Conversely, the probability of Cactuar finding "A" rank items is lowest, but they are very rare items.

==Story==
Mog, a [[moogle]], wants to hunt for treasure on Scary Mountain with his friends [[Cactuar]], [[Races of Final Fantasy#Moomba|Moomba]], and Boko. The others are too frightened, so Mog ventures to the Mountain alone. Three days pass without Mog's return, worrying his friends, who embark on a quest to find him. Boko leads the group, while Cactuar volunteers to gather items and Moomba offers to find weapons.

==Development==
''Chocobo World'' was conceptualized by [[Hiroyuki Itou]], who had developed for ''[[Final Fantasy (series)|Final Fantasy]]'' video games since ''[[Final Fantasy III]]'', which was released in [[1990 in video gaming|1990]]. The game was programmed by newcomer [[Takashi Katano]]<U+2014>who later held lead programmer roles in ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]''<U+2014>and designed by [[Hiroyuki Yotsuji]].

===Windows version===
In 2000, ''Chocobo World'' was [[game port|ported]] to [[Windows]]. The game was grouped with the Windows port of ''Final Fantasy VIII'' as a [[stand-alone]] program, containing the same functionality-sharing as their predecessors. Square Co. also provided a download of ''Chocobo World'' on their website,<ref>{{cite web | author=Dan Calderman | title=Chocobo World Playable on PC | publisher=www.rpgamer.com | year=2000 | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q1-2000/010600c.html | accessdate=2006-07-18}}</ref> as did [[Electronic Arts|Electronic Arts Japan]].<ref>http://www.japan.ea.com/archive/ff8/download.html</ref>

==Audio==
The Windows port of ''Chocobo World'' consists of six compositions from ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', arranged by an uncredited person. The tracks heard in the game include the Chocobo Theme "Odekake de Chocobo," the resting theme "Good Night, Until Tomorrow," a slightly altered battle theme, "Hurry, Faster!," and truncated versions of "Waltz de Chocobo," the victory theme, "Fanfare," and of "Dear to the Heart."
