'''Michel Foucault''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA pronunciation]]: {{IPA|/mi<U+0283>el fuko/}}; [[English]]-speakers' pronunciation varies) ([[October 15]], [[1926]] &ndash; [[June 25]], [[1984]]) was a [[French philosophy|French philosopher]]. He held a chair at the [[Coll<U+00E8>ge de France]], giving it the title "The [[History]] of [[Systems]] of [[Thought]]." His writings have had an enormous impact: Foucault's influence extends across the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] and into applied and [[professional]] areas of study. He was a key figure of [[Twentieth-Century French Philosophy]]. 

Foucault is known for his critical studies of various [[social institution]]s, most notably [[psychiatry]], [[medicine]], parameters of [[educational]] timeframes, and the [[prison]] system, and also for his work on the history of [[human sexual behavior|sexuality]].  His [[work]] concerning [[Power (sociology)|power]] and the relation between power and [[knowledge]], as well as his ideas concerning "[[discourse]]" in relation to the [[history of Western thought]], have been widely discussed and applied.

His work is often described as [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] or [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] by commentators and critics; during the 1960s, however, he was more often associated with the [[Structuralism|structuralist]] movement. Although he was initially happy with this description, he later emphasised his [[distance]] from the structuralist approach, and he always unequivocally rejected the 'post-structuralist' and  'postmodernist' labels.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Foucault was born in 1926 in [[Poitiers]] as Paul-Michel Foucault to a notable [[provincial]] [[family]]. His father, Paul Foucault, was an eminent [[surgeon]] and hoped his son would join him in the profession. Foucault later dropped 'Paul' from his name to distance himself from his father, who tried to alter his homosexuality {{Fact|date=February 2007}}.  His early education was a mix of success and mediocrity until he attended the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Coll<U+00E8>ge Saint-Stanislas, where he excelled. During this period, Poitiers was part of [[Vichy France]] and later came under German occupation. After [[World War II]], Foucault gained entry to the prestigious [[<U+00C9>cole Normale Sup<U+00E9>rieure]] (rue d'Ulm), the traditional gateway to an [[academic]] [[career]] in the [[humanities]] in [[France]]. From an early age he showed signs of [[premature balding]] and by his mid 20's lost most of his hair.

===The <U+00C9>cole Normale Sup<U+00E9>rieure===
Foucault's personal life during the <U+00C9>cole Normale was difficult&mdash;he suffered from [[Clinical depression|acute depression]], even attempting [[suicide]]. He was taken to see a psychiatrist. Perhaps because of this or in spite of it, Foucault became fascinated with [[psychology]]. Thus, in addition to his [[licence]] (degree) in philosophy he also earned a licence in psychology, which was at that time a very new qualification in France, and was involved in the clinical arm of the discipline where he was exposed to thinkers such as [[Ludwig Binswanger]].

Like many '' '[[<U+00C9>cole Normale Sup<U+00E9>rieure|normalien]]s' '', Foucault joined the [[French Communist Party]] from 1950 to 1953. He was inducted into the party by his mentor [[Louis Althusser]]. He left due to concerns about what was happening in the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Stalin]].  Various people such as historian [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]] have reported that Foucault never actively participated in his cell, unlike many other party members.

===Early career===
Foucault passed his ''[[agr<U+00E9>gation]]'' in 1950. After a brief period lecturing at the <U+00C9>cole Normale, he took up a position at the [[University of Lille]], where from 1953 to 1954 he taught psychology. In 1954 Foucault published his first book, ''Maladie mentale et personnalit<U+00E9>,'' a work which he would later disavow. It soon became apparent that Foucault was not interested in a teaching career, and he undertook a lengthy exile from France. In 1954 Foucault served France as a cultural delegate to the [[University of Uppsala]] in [[Sweden]] (a position arranged for him by [[Georges Dum<U+00E9>zil]], who was to become a friend and mentor). In 1958 Foucault left Uppsala for briefly held positions at [[Warsaw University]] and at the [[University of Hamburg]].

Foucault returned to [[France]] in 1960 to complete his doctorate and take up a post in [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Clermont-Ferrand]]. There he met [[Daniel Defert]], with whom he lived in a non-monogamous partnership for the rest of his life. In 1961 he earned his doctorate by submitting two theses (as is customary in France): a "major" thesis entitled ''Folie et d<U+00E9>raison: Histoire de la folie <U+00E0> l'<U+00E2>ge classique'' and a 'secondary' thesis which involved a translation and commentary on [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View''. ''Folie et d<U+00E9>raison'' (ironically published in English as ''[[Madness and Civilization]]'') was extremely well-received. Foucault continued a vigorous publishing schedule. In 1963 he published ''Naissance de la Clinique'' (''[[Birth of the Clinic]]''), ''[[Raymond Roussel]]'', and a reissue of his 1954 volume (now entitled ''Maladie mentale et psychologie'') which he would again disavow.

After Defert was posted to [[Tunisia]] for his [[military service]], Foucault moved to a position at the [[University of Tunis]] in 1965. In 1966 he published ''Les Mots et les choses'' (''[[The Order of Things]]''), which was enormously popular despite its length and difficulty. This was during the height of interest in [[structuralism]] and Foucault was quickly grouped with scholars such as [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Claude L<U+00E9>vi-Strauss]], and [[Roland Barthes]] as the newest, latest wave of thinkers set to topple the [[existentialism]] popularized by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Foucault made a number of skeptical comments about Marxism, which outraged a number of Left wing critics, but he quickly tired of being labelled a 'structuralist'. He was still in [[Tunis]] during the [[May 1968|May 1968 student rebellions]], where he was profoundly affected by a local student revolt earlier in the same year. In the fall of 1968 he returned to France, where he published ''L'arch<U+00E9>ologie du savoir'' (''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]'') &mdash; a methodological response to his critics &mdash; in 1969.

===Post-1968: Foucault the activist===
In the aftermath of 1968, the French government created a new experimental university at [[Vincennes]]. Foucault became the first head of its philosophy department in December of that year and appointed mostly young leftist academics (such as [[Judith Miller (philosopher)|Judith Miller]]) whose radicalism provoked the Ministry of Education to withdraw the department's accreditation. Foucault notoriously also joined students in occupying administration buildings and fighting with police.

Foucault's tenure at Vincennes was short-lived, as in 1970 he was elected to France's most prestigious academic body, the [[Coll<U+00E8>ge de France]] as Professor of the History of Systems of Thought. His political involvement now increased, Defert having joined the ultra-[[Maoist]] [[Gauche Proletarienne]] (GP). Foucault helped found the [[Prison Information Group]] (in French: Groupe d'Information sur les Prisons or GIP) to provide a way for [[prison]]ers to voice their concerns. This fed into a marked politicization of Foucault's work, with a book, ''Surveiller et Punir'' (''[[Discipline and Punish]]''), which "narrates" the micro-power structures that developed in Western societies since the [[18th century|eighteenth century]], with a special focus on [[prison]]s and [[school]]s.

===The late Foucault===
In the late 1970s, political activism in France tailed off with the disillusionment of many left wing militants. A number of young Maoists abandoned their beliefs to become the so-called [[New Philosophers]], often citing Foucault as their major influence, a status about which Foucault had mixed feelings. Foucault in this period embarked on a 6 volume project ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', which he was never to complete. Its first volume, ''The Will to Knowledge'', was published in 1976. The second and third volumes did not appear for another eight years, and they surprised readers by their subject matter, (classical Greek and Latin texts) approach and style, particularly Foucault's focus on the subject, a concept he had previously neglected.

Foucault began to spend more time in the [[United States]], at [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]] (where he had lectured on his first ever visit to the [[United States]] in 1970) and especially at [[UC Berkeley]]. In 1975 he took [[LSD]] at [[Zabriskie Point]] in [[Death Valley National Park]], later calling it the best experience of his life. In 1978 Foucault made two tours of [[Iran]], undertaking extensive interviews with political protagonists in support of the new revolutionary Islamic government there. His many essays on [[Iran]] were published in the Italian newspaper ''Corriere Della Sera'', only appeared in French in 1994 and in then in English in 2005. These essays caused some controversy, with some commentators arguing that Foucault was insufficiently critical of the new regime. 

In [[San Francisco]] of the 1970s and early 1980s, Foucault participated in the subcultures of [[Gay bathhouse|anonymous gay sex]] and [[Sadism and masochism|sadomasochism]] <U+2014> it is suspected that it was there that he contracted [[HIV]], in the days before the [[disease]] was described as such. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

It is unknown to what extent Foucault understood the cause of the disease or its transmission, but some biographers and critics have described his sex life at this time as the practical exploration of his ideas about normality and abnormality, and of the link between pleasure and death.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Daniel Defert stated "When he went to San Francisco for the last time, he took it as a [[limit-experience]]."{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Foucault died of an [[AIDS]]-related illness in [[Paris]] June 26th, 1984.

Although the nearly-finished fourth volume of his History of Sexuality is being held by his estate indefinitely, an English translation of an early draft is rumored to have left France with a foreigner described by Foucault as a "gifted professional colleague" known only as "young Monsieur Maundrell".

==Works==
===''Madness and Civilization (1961)''===
{{main|Madness and Civilization}}
The English edition of ''Madness and Civilization'' is an abridged version of ''Folie et d<U+00E9>raison: Histoire de la folie <U+00E0> l'<U+00E2>ge classique'', originally published in 1961. (A full translation titled ''The History of Madness'' has been published by [[Routledge]] : ISBN 0-415-27701-9) This was Foucault's first major book, written while he was the Director of the Maison de France in Sweden. It examines ideas, practices, institutions, art and literature relating to [[insanity|madness]] in Western history.

Foucault begins his history in the [[Middle Ages]], noting the social and physical exclusion of [[leprosy|lepers]]. He argues that with the gradual disappearance of leprosy, madness came to occupy this excluded position. The [[ship of fools]] in the 15th century is a literary version of one such exclusionary practice, the practice of sending mad people away in ships. In 17th century Europe, in a movement which Foucault famously describes as the Great Confinement, "unreasonable" members of the population were locked away and institutionalised. In the eighteenth century, madness came to be seen as the obverse of Reason, and, finally, in the nineteenth century as [[mental illness]].

Foucault also argues that madness lost its power to signify the limits of social order and to point to the truth and was silenced by Reason. He examines the rise of scientific and "humanitarian" treatments of the insane, notably at the hands of [[Philippe Pinel]] and [[Samuel Tuke]]. He claims that these new treatments were in fact no less controlling than previous methods. Tuke's country retreat for the mad consisted of punishing the madmen until they learned to act "reasonably". Similarly, Pinel's treatment of the mad amounted to an extended [[aversion therapy]], including such treatments as freezing showers and use of a straitjacket. In Foucault's view, this treatment amounted to repeated brutality until the pattern of judgment and punishment was [[Internalization|internalized]] by the patient.

===''The Birth of the Clinic''===
Foucault's second major book, ''The Birth of the Clinic: An Archaeology of Medical Perception'' (''Naissance de la clinique: une arch<U+00E9>ologie du regard m<U+00E9>dical'' in French) was published in 1963 in France, and translated to English in 1973. Picking up from ''Madness and Civilization'', ''The Birth of the Clinic'' traces the development of the medical profession, and specifically the institution of the ''clinique'' (translated as "clinic", but here largely referring to teaching hospitals). Its motif is the concept of the medical ''regard'' (a concept which has garnered a lot of attention from English-language readers, due to Alan Sheridan's unusual translation, "[[medical gaze]]").

===''The Order of Things''===
{{main|The Order of Things}}
Foucault's ''Les Mots et les choses. Une arch<U+00E9>ologie des sciences humaines'' was published in 1966. It was translated into English in 1970 under the title ''The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences'' (Foucault had preferred ''L'Ordre des Choses'' for the original French title, but changed the title as there was already another book of this title).

The book opened with an extended discussion of [[Diego Vel<U+00E1>zquez]]'s painting ''[[Las Meninas]]'' and its complex arrangement of sight-lines, hiddenness and appearance. Then it developed its central claim: that all periods of history possessed certain underlying conditions of truth that constituted what was acceptable as, for example, [[scientific]] discourse. Foucault argued that these conditions of discourse changed over time, in major and relatively sudden shifts, from one period's [[episteme]] to another.

Foucault's critique of Renaissance values in Les mots et les choses has been very influential to cultural history. The various consciousness shifts that he points out in the first chapters of the book have led several scholars to scrutinize the bases for knowledge in our present day as well as critiquing the projection of modern categories of knowledge onto subjects that remain intrinsically unintelligible, in spite of historical knowledge. 

''The Order of Things'' brought Foucault to prominence as an intellectual figure in France. A review by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] attacked Foucault as 'the last rampart of the [[bourgeoisie]]'.

===''The Archaeology of Knowledge''===
{{main|The Archaeology of Knowledge}}
Published in 1969, this volume was Foucault's main excursion into methodology. He wrote it in order to deal with the reception of ''Les Mots et les choses''. It makes references to Anglo-American [[analytical philosophy]], particularly [[speech act]] theory.

Foucault directs his analysis toward the "statement", the basic unit of [[discourse]] that he believes has been ignored up to this point. "Statement" is the English translation from French ''<U+00E9>nonc<U+00E9>'' (that which is enunciated or expressed), which has a peculiar meaning for Foucault. "<U+00C9>nonc<U+00E9>" for Foucault means that which makes [[proposition]]s, [[utterance]]s, or [[speech acts]] meaningful. In this understanding, statements themselves are not [[proposition]]s, [[utterance]]s, or [[speech acts]]. Rather, statements create a network of rules establishing what is meaningful, and it is these rules that are the preconditions for [[proposition]]s, [[utterance]]s, or [[speech acts]] to have meaning. Statements are also 'events'. Depending on whether or not they comply with the rules of meaning, a grammatically correct sentence may still lack meaning and inversely, an incorrect sentence may still be meaningful. Statements depend on the conditions in which they emerge and exist within a field of discourse. It is huge collections of statements, called discursive formations, toward which Foucault aims his analysis. It is important to note that Foucault reiterates that the analysis he is outlining is only one possible tactic, and that he is not seeking to displace other ways of analysing discourse or render them as invalid.

According to Dreyfus & Rabinow {{Fact|date=February 2007}}, Foucault not only brackets out issues of [[truth]] (cf. [[Husserl]]) he also brackets out issues of [[meaning]]. Rather than looking for a deeper meaning underneath discourse or looking for the source of meaning in some transcendental subject, Foucault analyzes the discursive and practical conditions of the existence for truth and meaning. In order to show the principles of meaning and truth production in various discursive formations he details how truth claims emerge during various epochs on the basis of what was actually said and written during these periods of time. He particularly describes the [[Renaissance]], the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and the 20th Century. He strives to avoid all interpretation and to depart from the goals of [[hermeneutics]]. This does not mean that Foucault denounces truth and meaning, but just that [[truth]] and [[meaning]] depend on the historical discursive and practical means of truth and meaning production. For instance, although they were radically different during Enlightenment as opposed to Modernity, there were indeed meaning, truth and correct treatment of madness during both epochs ([[Madness and Civilization]]). This posture allows Foucault to move away from an [[anthropological]] standpoint, denouncing ''a priori'' concepts of the nature of the human subject, and focus on the role of discursive practices in constituting subjectivity. 

Dispensing with finding a deeper meaning behind discourse would appear to lead Foucault toward [[structuralism]]. However, whereas structuralists search for homogeneity in a discursive entity, Foucault focuses on differences. Instead of asking what constitutes the specificity of European thought he asks what differences develop within it over time. Therefore, he refuses to examine statements outside of their role in the discursive formation, and he never examines ''possible'' statements that could have emerged from such a formation. His identity as a historian emerges here, as he is only interested in analysing statements in their historical context. The whole of the system and its discursive rules determine the identity of the statement. But, a discursive formation continually generates new statements, and some of these usher in changes in the discursive formation that may or may not be realized. Therefore, to describe a discursive formation, Foucault also focuses on expelled and forgotten discourses that never happen to change the discursive formation. Their difference to the dominant discourse also describe it. In this way one can describe specific systems that determine which types of statements emerge.

===''Discipline and Punish''===
{{main|Discipline and Punish}}
''Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison'' was translated to English in 1977, from the French ''Surveiller et punir: Naissance de la prison'', published in 1975.

[[Image:Panopticon.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[Panopticon]], discussed in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'']]

The book opens with a graphic description of the brutal public execution in 1757 of [[Robert-Fran<U+00E7>ois Damiens]], who attempted to kill [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. Against this it juxtaposes a colourless prison timetable from just over 80 years later. Foucault then inquires how such a change in French society's punishment of convicts could have developed in such a short time. These are snapshots of two contrasting types of Foucault's "Technologies of Punishment". The first type, "Monarchical Punishment", involves the repression of the populace through brutal public displays of [[execution (legal)|execution]]s and [[torture]]. The second, "Disciplinary Punishment," is what Foucault says is practiced in the modern era. Disciplinary punishment gives "professionals" (psychologists, programme facilitators, parole officers, etc.) power over the prisoner, most notably in that the prisoner's length of stay depends on the professionals' opinion. 

Foucault also compares modern society with [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s "[[Panopticon]]" design for prisons (which was unrealized in its original form, but nonetheless influential): in the Panopticon, a single guard can watch over many prisoners while the guard remains unseen. The dark dungeon of pre-modernity has been replaced with the bright modern prison, but Foucault cautions that "visibility is a trap". It is through this visibility, Foucault writes, that modern society exercises its controlling systems of power and knowledge (terms which Foucault believed to be so fundamentally connected that he often combined them in a single hyphenated concept, "power-knowledge"). Increasing visibility leads to power located on an increasingly individualized level, shown by the possibility for institutions to track individuals throughout their lives. Foucault suggests that a "carceral continuum" runs through modern society, from the maximum security prison, through secure accommodation, probation, social workers, police, and teachers, to our everyday working and domestic lives. All are connected by the (witting or unwitting) supervision (surveillance, application of norms of acceptable behaviour) of some humans by others.

===''The History of Sexuality''===
{{main|The History of Sexuality}}
Three volumes of ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' were published before Foucault's death in 1984. The first and most referenced volume, ''[[The Will to Knowledge]]'' (previously known as ''An Introduction'' in English <U+2014> ''Histoire de la sexualit<U+00E9>, 1: la volont<U+00E9> de savoir'' in French) was published in France in 1976, and translated in 1977, focusing primarily on the last two centuries, and the functioning of sexuality as an analytics of power related to the emergence of a science of sexuality (''scientia sexualis'') and the emergence of [[biopower]] in the West. In this volume he attacks the "repressive hypothesis," the widespread belief that we have, particularly since the nineteenth century, "repressed" our natural sexual drives. He shows that what we think of as "repression" of sexuality actually constituted sexuality as a core feature of our identities, and produced a proliferation of discourse on the subject. 

The second two volumes, ''[[The Use of Pleasure]]'' (''Histoire de la sexualite, II: l'usage des plaisirs'') and ''[[The Care of the Self]]'' (''Histoire de la sexualit<U+00E9>, III: le souci de soi'') dealt with the role of sex in [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] antiquity. Both were published in 1984, the year of Foucault's death, with the second volume being translated in 1985, and the third in 1986.  In his lecture series from 1979 to 1980 Foucault extended his analysis of government to its 'wider sense of techniques and procedures designed to direct the behaviour of men', which involved a new consideration of the 'examination of conscience' and confession in early Christian literature. These themes of early Christian literature seemed to dominate Foucault's work, alongside his study of Greek and Roman literature, until the end of his life. However, Foucault's death from AIDS left the work incomplete, and the planned fourth volume of his ''History of Sexuality'' on Christianity was never published.  The fourth volume was to be entitled ''[[Confessions of the Flesh]]'' (''Les aveux de la chair'').  The volume was almost complete before Foucault's death and a copy of it is privately held in the Foucault archive. It cannot be published under the restrictions of Foucault's estate. <ref>{{cite book|title=[[Religion and culture: Michel Foucault]]|author=Michel Foucault, edited by Jeremy R. Carrette|year=1999|id=ISBN 0-415-92362-X}}</ref>

===Power/Knowledge===
Power/Knowledge was a work by Foucault that explains his theory of how power is created and transferred throughout an "economy" of [[discourse]] (or conversation). It shows how power is transferred along conduits of dialogue according to the knowledge one has. Barry Allen says that it is only to have a statement pass among others as "known or true". Therefore, knowledge does not necessarily have to be true, but it only needs to be passed on as true for the statement to have an effect on the speakers in the discourse. [http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Speech/rccs/theory54.htm]

===Lectures===
From 1970 until his death in 1984, from January to March of each year except 1977, Foucault gave a course of public lectures and seminars weekly at the [[Coll<U+00E8>ge de France]] as the condition of his tenure as professor there. All these lectures were tape-recorded, and Foucault's transcripts also survive. In 1997 these lectures began to be published in French with six volumes having appeared so far. So far, four sets of lectures have appeared in English: ''Psychiatric Power 1973-1974'', ''Abnormal 1974-1975'', ''Society Must Be Defended 1975 - 1976'', and ''The Hermeneutics of the Subject 1981-1982''. Notes of Foucault's lectures from UC Berkeley has also appeared as ''Fearless Speech''.

*''Society Must Be Defended'' (1975-76)
In this course, Foucault analyzed the historical and political discourse of "race struggle".

===Terminology===

*[[biopower]]/[[biopolitics]]
*[[Disciplinary institutions]]
*[[episteme]] (''<U+00E9>pist<U+00E9>m<U+00E9>'')

==Foucault on age of consent==

{{main|Sexual Morality and the Law}}

Michel Foucault has also had some participation in political life.

In 1977, while a Commission of the French [[Parliament]] discussed a change in the French [[Penal Code]], he signed a [[French petitions against age of consent laws|petition]], along with [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Louis Althusser]], among others, asking for the [[abrogation]] of some articles of the law in order to [[abolition of age of consent laws|decriminalize all consensual relations]] between adults and minors below the age of fifteen (the [[age of consent]] in France).{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

These ideas are expressed in his text ''[[Sexual Morality and the Law]]'', chapter 16 of his book ''Politics, Philosophy, Culture <U+2013> Interviews and other writings 1977-1984''.

He believed that the [[penal system]] was replacing the [[punishment]] of [[criminal acts]] by the creation of the figure of an individual [[danger|dangerous]] to society (regardless of any actual crime), and predicted that a society of dangers would come, where sexuality would be a kind of roaming danger, a <U+201C>phantom<U+201D>. He stressed that this would be possible thanks to the establishment of a <U+201C>new medical power<U+201D>, interested in profits coming from the treatment of this <U+201C>dangerous individual<U+201D>.
<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Politics, Philosophy, Culture <U+2013> Interviews and other writings 1977-1984]]|author=Michel Foucault, edited by Lawrence D. Kritzman|year=1988|id=ISBN 0-415-90082-4}}</ref>.

==Criticisms of Foucault==
Many thinkers have criticized Foucault, including [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Camille Paglia]], [[J<U+00FC>rgen Habermas]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Nancy Fraser]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] (1990), [[Slavoj <U+017D>i<U+017E>ek]] and historian [[Hayden White]], among others. While each of these thinkers takes issue with different aspects of Foucault's work, all of these approaches share the same basic orientation: they argue that Foucault rejects the values and philosophy associated with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] while simultaneously secretly relying on them. This criticism is developed, for example, in Derrida (1978).  It is claimed that this failure either makes him dangerously [[Nihilism|nihilistic]], or that he cannot be taken seriously in his disavowal of normative values because in fact his work ultimately presupposes them.

It is important to note, however, that there has been considerable debate over these criticisms and that they are not universally accepted as valid by all critics. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} Foucault himself on a number of occasions explained that he believed strongly in human [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]] and that his philosophy was a fundamentally optimistic one, as he believed that something positive could always be done no matter how bleak the situation. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} One might also add that his work is actually aimed at refuting the position that [[Reason]] (or "rationality") is the sole means of guaranteeing [[truth]] and the validity of ethical systems. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} Thus, to criticise Reason is not to reject all notions of truth and [[ethics]] as some of these critics claim. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Foucault has also been criticised for his use of historical information, with claims that he frequently misrepresented things, got his facts wrong, extrapolated from insufficient data, or simply made them up entirely. For example, some historians argue that what Foucault called the "Great Confinement" in ''[[Madness and Civilization]]'' did not in fact occur during the 17th century, but rather in the 19th century,<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Les M<U+00E9>decines de la Folie]]|author=Pierre Morel and Claude Qu<U+00E9>tel|year=1985|id=ISBN 2-01-011281-4}}</ref> which casts doubt on Foucault's association of the confinement of madmen with the Age of Enlightenment. Despite concerns about his accuracy, Foucault's analysis and methods have influenced a number of other historians such as [[Roger Chartier]] and his studies about the "invention of the author." 

''Madness and Civilization'' was also famously criticised by [[Jacques Derrida]] who took issue with Foucault's reading of [[Ren<U+00E9> Descartes]]' ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''. Derrida's criticism led to a break in their friendship and marked the beginning of a fifteen-year<U+2013>long feud between the two. (At one point, in a 1983 interview with Paul Rabinow, Foucault seemed to criticize Derrida's reading of [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]'' in ''Of Grammatology'', considering the writing/speech distinction unimportant.) They eventually reconciled in the early 1980s (reportedly, this reconciliation was due in part to Foucault's defense of Derrida after the latter was alleged to have been caught with marijuana in Prague).

There are also notable exchanges with [[Lawrence Stone]] and [[George Steiner]] on the subject of Foucault's historical accuracy, as well as a discussion with historian [[Jacques Leonard]] concerning ''Discipline and Punish''. Foucault's "histories" have nonetheless drawn considerable attention from "mainstream" historians as Foucault's works frequently dealt with unique or overlooked historical problems.

==Foucault's changing viewpoint==
The study of Foucault's thought is complicated because his ideas developed and changed over time. Just how they changed and at what levels is a matter of some dispute amongst scholars of his work. Some scholars argue that underneath the changes of subject matter there are certain themes that run through all of his work. But as [[David Gauntlett]] (2002) suggests: 

{{Quotation|Of course, there's nothing wrong with Foucault changing his approach; in a 1982 interview, he remarked that 'When people say, "Well, you thought this a few years ago and now you say something else," my answer is<U+2026> [laughs] "Well, do you think I have worked [hard] all those years to say the same thing and not to be changed?"' (2000: 131). This attitude to his own work fits well with his theoretical approach <U+2014> that knowledge should transform the self. When asked in another 1982 interview if he was a philosopher, historian, structuralist, or Marxist, Foucault replied 'I don't feel that it is necessary to know exactly what I am. The main interest in life and work is to become someone else that you were not in the beginning' (Martin, 1988: 9).|David Gauntlett|Media, Gender and Identity, London: Routledge, 2002)}}

In a similar vein, Foucault preferred not to claim that he was presenting a coherent and timeless block of knowledge; rather, as he says:

{{Quotation|I would like my books to be a kind of tool-box which others can rummage through to find a tool which they can use however they wish in their own area<U+2026> I would like the little volume that I want to write on disciplinary systems to be useful to an educator, a warden, a magistrate, a conscientious objector. I don't write for an audience, I write for users, not readers.|Michel Foucault (1974)|'Prisons et asiles dans le m<U+00E9>canisme du pouvoir' in Dits et Ecrits, t. II. Paris: Gallimard, 1994, pp. 523-4).}}

==Intellectual contexts==
===Influences on Foucault's work===
Thinkers whose work has apparently or admittedly had a strong impact on Foucault's thought include:
*[[Louis Althusser]] &mdash; French structuralist Marxist philosopher and Foucault's sometime teacher and mentor.
*[[Roland Barthes]] &mdash; French (post) structuralist literary critic who was at one time very close to Foucault.
*[[Georges Bataille]] &mdash; French Nietzschean political and aesthetic philosopher.
*[[Maurice Blanchot]] &mdash; Literary critic and novelist whose views on non polemical critique had a strong impact on Foucault
*[[Jorge Luis Borges]]  &mdash; Argentine author of short stories frequently referred to in Foucault's Works
*[[Georges Canguilhem]] &mdash; French historian of science.
*[[Gilles Deleuze]] &mdash; French philosopher. A great friend and ally of Foucault's in the early 1970s.
*[[Georges Dum<U+00E9>zil]] &mdash; French structuralist mythologist, known for his reconstruction of [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] mythology.
*[[Martin Heidegger]] &mdash; German philosopher whose influence was enormous in post-war France. Foucault rarely referred to him, but called him 'the essential philosopher'.
*[[Jean Hyppolite]] &mdash; French [[Hegel]] scholar and Foucault's sometime [[kh<U+00E2>gne]] teacher.
*[[Immanuel Kant]] &mdash; German philosopher regarded as one of the most influential thinkers of modern Europe and the last major philosopher of the Enlightenment.
*[[Karl Marx]] &mdash; Marx's influence in French intellectual life was dominant from 1945 through to the late 1970s. Foucault often opposed unthinking forms of Marxist ideology, but was not averse to referring to Marx's own work on occasion.
*[[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] &mdash; French philosopher and sometime teacher of Foucault. [[Phenomenologist]] instrumental in popularising [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]]'s [[structuralism]] for a philosophical audience.
*[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] &mdash; German philosopher whose work greatly influenced Foucault's conception of society and power. Towards the end of his life, Foucault stated: "I am a Nietzschean".

===Influence of Foucault's work===
Foucault's work is frequently referred to in disciplines as diverse as [[art]], [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[communication studies]], [[public relations]], [[rhetoric]], [[cultural studies]], [[linguistics]], [[sociology]], [[education]], [[psychology]], [[literary theory]], [[feminism]], [[queer theory]], [[management|management studies]], [[philosophy of science|the philosophy of science]], [[urban design]], [[museum studies]], and many others. Quantitative evidence of the impact of his work can be found in the sheer volume of citations in standard academic journal indexes such as the Social Sciences Citation Index [http://www.isinet.com/products/citation/ssci/] (more than 9000 citations). A keyword search of the [[Library of Congress]] catalogue [http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&CNT=25+records+per+page&CMD=nkey+Foucault] reveals over 750 volumes in a variety of languages relating to his writings, and a search on [[Google Scholar]] [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=michel+foucault] reveals thousands of citations.

==Trivia==
In the famous 1971 debate between Michel Foucault and [[Noam Chomsky]] on Dutch Television, Foucault was asked to wear a bright red wig when giving his presentation (he refused) and was partially paid for the appearance with a chunk of hashish, which Foucault apparently called "Chomsky Hash."  Although the conversation was friendly, Chomsky afterward referred to Foucault's views as "completely amoral."[http://www.firstthings.com/article.php3?id_article=5194&var_recherche=meyer]

===Anthologies===
In French, almost all of Foucault's shorter writings, published interviews and miscellany have been published in a collection called ''Dits et <U+00E9>crits'', originally published in four volumes in 1994, latterly in only two volumes.

In English, there are a number of overlapping anthologies, which often use conflicting translations of the overlapping pieces, frequently with different titles. Richard Lynch's [http://www.foucault.qut.edu.au/lynch.html bibliography] of Foucault's shorter work is invaluable for keeping track of these multiple versions. The major collections in English are:
*''Language, counter-memory, practice'', ed. Donald F. Bouchard (1977)
*''Power/Knowledge'', ed. Colin Gordon (1980)
*''The Foucault Reader'', ed. [[Paul Rabinow]] (1984)
*''Politics, Philosophy, Culture'', ed. Lawrence D. Kritzman (1988)
*''Foucault Live'' (2nd Ed.), ed. [[Sylv<U+00E8>re Lotringer]] (1996)
*''The Politics of Truth'', ed. Sylv<U+00E8>re Lotringer (1997)
*''Ethics : subjectivity and truth'' (Essential Works Vol. 1), ed.Paul Rabinow (1997)
*''Aesthetics, Method, Epistemology'' (Essential Works Vol.2), ed. James D. Faubion (1998)
*''Power'' (Essential Works Vol. 3), ed. James D. Faubion (2000)
*''The Essential Foucault'', eds. Paul Rabinow and Nikolas Rose (2003)
