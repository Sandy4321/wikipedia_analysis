The structure is recognized as having been first constructed in 1839,<ref name=MCGI/> although this represents an earlier structure built on the site.  The current date on the [[pediment]] states 1845, which is the date that the current structure was erected<U+2014>having been completed the following year.<ref name=COURT/>  It was commissioned by state representative and state senator Alvin H. Hart, who lobbied successfully for Lapeer to continue to serve as the [[county seat]].  Hart sold the structure to the Board of Supervisors of Lapeer County for $4,500 in 1853.  The first local [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange]] in Michigan was founded at this site in 1872.  Since its construction, the only alteration to the structure occurred when three doorways were cut into the [[portico]] in 1938.<ref name=MCGI/>
