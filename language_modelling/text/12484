[[Wing Commander]] [[General]] '''Franti<U+0161>ek Pe<U+0159>ina''' (pronounced "PEAR-zhi-nah") ([[April 8]] [[1911]], [[Mork<U+016F>vky]] u [[B<U+0159>eclav District|B<U+0159>eclavi]];<ref name="HN1">[http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3032966.html World War II: Interview with Czech Ace Frantisek Perina] HistoryNet Page1</ref> died [[May 6]] [[2006]] in [[Prague]]) was a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] fighter pilot, an ace during [[World War Two]] with the French [[Armee de l'Air]], who also served twice with Britain's [[Royal Air Force]].

==Biography==
Born into a farming family in [[South Moravian Region]], Pe<U+0159>ina didn't visit the city of [[Brno]] until he was 14.<ref name="HN1"/> He undertook a full elementary school education, followed by three in grammar school, and then transferred to a vocational school, serving an apprenticeship and training as a [[machinist]]. After qualifying, he spent six months in the job before seeing an airshow, and applying to train for the [[Czech Air Force]].<ref name="HN1"/>

===Czech Air Force===
Reporting to [[Prostejov]] airfield on [[October 1]], [[1929]], after under taking Army officer training he trained to fly on the [[Letov <U+0160>-10|Letov S-10 Sardinka (sardine)]], the [[Letov <U+0160>-14]] and the [[Avia S.18|Avia S.18 Komar (mosquito)]].<ref name="HN1"/> Graduating in 1931, he then spent two years as a first class airman, before promotion to sergeant. In 1932 he attended fighter school in [[Cheb]], [[Sudetenland]], training for four months in air-to-air and air-to-ground gunnery, as well as aerobatics on various biplane and single wing fighters. He returned to his unit, and then was attached to the 34th fighter squadron at [[Olomouc]] on [[Letov <U+0160>-18|Letov <U+0160>-20 Smolik]] [[biplane]]s.<ref name="HN2">[http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3032966.html?page=2&c=y World War II: Interview with Czech Ace Frantisek Perina] HistoryNet Page2</ref>

In 1937 Pe<U+0159>ina represented the [[Czechoslovakian]] air force at the International Air Show in [[Z<U+00FC>rich]], [[Switzerland]] in an [[Avia B-534]]. There he met the German contingent, headed by [[World War One]] ace [[Ernst Udet]] in his capacity as chief of the Luftwaffe's office of supply and procurement, and [[Erhard Milch]], second-in-command of the Luftwaffe - the team were equipped with [[Heinkel He-51]]'s and the new [[Messerschmitt Bf-109]]. Pe<U+0159>ina later commented that the Germans he met were mostly gentlemen, not Nazis. Pe<U+0159>ina took third place in both aerobatics and in the climb-and-dive competition, and fourth in the cross-country flight: always behind German pilots in superior equipment.<ref name="HN3">[http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3032966.html?page=3&c=y World War II: Interview with Czech Ace Frantisek Perina] HistoryNet Page3</ref>

After the 34th fighter squadron were requested to transfer, as the station commander at Olomouc wanted Pe<U+0159>ina to stay he was transferred to the 36th Fighter Squadron when it was rotated to the airfield with reconnaissance pilot [[Josef Frantisek]],<ref name="HN7">[http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3032966.html?page=7&c=y World War II: Interview with Czech Ace Frantisek Perina] HistoryNet Page7</ref> staying with them through the 1938 [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Sudeten Crisis]].<ref name="HN2"/> He was then posted to military school to serve as Rotmistr (warrant officer), but in the aftermath of the Sudeten Crisis the Czechoslovakian air force began to form new squadrons, and he joined the 52nd Fighter Squadron as its chief pilot.<ref name="HN3"/>

After a border war with [[Hungary]], aged 28 (the age at which officers could marry, as it was presumed they had an income to support a family), he married Anna Klimesova on June 24, 1939, and left for [[Poland]] without his wife on June 26 (she was delayed through paperwork), with the intention of joining the [[French Foreign Legion]] in [[North Africa]].

===Armee de l'Air===
Following the first dissolution of [[Czechoslovakia]] and the annexation of Bohemia and Moravia by [[Nazi Germany]], and after the Germans invaded Poland on September 1, 1939; France declared war on Germany and the Czechs obtained a contract from the [[French Air Ministry]] to transfer from the Foreign Legion to the [[Arm<U+00E9>e de l'Air]].<ref name="HN3"/>

Initiated at [[Ch<U+00E2>tres, Seine-et-Marne]], Pe<U+0159>ina flew the [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company|Curtiss]] [[P-36 Hawk|H-75A]].<ref name="RadioCZ">[http://www.radio.cz/en/article/78611 Frantisek Perina - Czechoslovakia's ace pilot who made his name in the Battle of France] radio.cz - 5 August, 2006</ref> On December 1, 1939, Pe<U+0159>ina was assigned to the 1<U+00E8>re Escadrille of Groupe de Chasse I, Escadre de Chasse 5 based at [[Suippes]], near [[Reims]]. Amusingly, the squadron was made up of the French pilots who had attended the Zurich air festival, and commanded by Capitaine [[Jean Accart]]. His friends decided to rename him '''Fran<U+00E7>ois Renop<U+00E9>,''' in case he was taken prisoner - the Germans would treat a French prisoner much better than they would an exiled Czech.<ref name="HN4">[http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3032966.html?page=4&c=y World War II: Interview with Czech Ace Frantisek Perina] HistoryNet Page4</ref>

Following the end of the [[Phoney War]], Perina made his name in the very first days of Germany's [[Battle of France|western offensive]]. On [[May 10]], [[1940]] after Nazi Germany began executing its [[Manstein Plan|Manstein battle plan]] against France, the [[Netherlands]], and [[Belgium]], Perina shot down four planes in two sorties - he was promoted to sergent-chef. The next day he shot down his fifth, resulting in Perina became the first Czech Ace in the Second World War - a day after that he shot down two additional planes.<ref name="RadioCZ"/> Promoted to adjutant (officer), he became well known throughout France thanks to media coverage of his exploits.<ref name="HN4"/>

After the Germans occupied Sedan, Pe<U+0159>ina squadron moved to [[St. Dizier]] on the [[Marne River]] on [[May 14]]. In June 1940 as the [[Luftwaffe]] focused on Paris, Pe<U+0159>ina and colleagues tried to turn back a bombing formation. While his colleagues focused on the bombers, Perina focused on a fighter escort of 60 [[Messerschmitt]] [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109's]], shooting down one plane but badly shot himself. In interview on his 95th birthday, he recalled:

<blockquote>I had to gain them some time, and I could think of nothing other than to attack. I had to stop them somehow. I distracted them, and I even managed to shoot one down, but then I myself was hit. My plane took 15 cannon hits, 80 by machine gun. My leg and my arm were injured, although I didn't feel a thing. I knew I probably wasn't going to make it back.
</blockquote>

After being hospitalised in [[Coulomiers]] east of Paris, he left the hospital and escaped to Paris as the Germans advanced, and then to Chartres. He then joined GC I/5 at [[Carcasonne]], retrieving a Curtiss with a flat tailwheel tire from another airfield and flying in two hours to the [[Free French Forces]] in [[St. Denis Siq]] airfield, located in [[Oran]] near [[Algiers]], [[Algeria]]. Having been awarded but never received the customary [[Croix de Guerre]] for his first air-to-air victory, the Free French decorated Pe<U+0159>ina as a [[L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur|Ch<U+00E9>valier de la L<U+00E9>gion d'Honneur]], and was also awarded the Croix de Guerre with six palms. Having left his uniform in France, he ordered a new one in Oman and travelled by train to [[Casablanca]], where he boarded a ship to [[England]].<ref>[http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3032966.html?page=6&c=y World War II: Interview with Czech Ace Frantisek Perina] HistoryNet Page6</ref>

===Royal Air Force===
After a 29day boat trip, Pe<U+0159>ina was allocated to the [[No. 312 Squadron RAF]] (Czechoslovak) Squadron, flying [[Hawker Hurricanes]].<ref name="HN7"/> He saw little action before suffering from acute [[appendicitis]], treated at hospital in [[Ely]], [[Cambridgeshire]]. He returned to 312 after recovery, and moved with the squadron to [[Ayr]], [[Scotland]] in 1941 to convert to [[Supermarine Spitfire]] MkV's.

Having not scored a kill in his service in the RAF, on June 3, 1942 while escorting bombers he shot down two [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]'s from a formation of four, for which one was confirmed and a second probable. Pe<U+0159>ina was than assigned to serve as sector gunnery officer for one year, and then for the rest of the war to Fighter Command as part of the Czech liaison establishment, until May 8, 1945.<ref name="HN7"/>

===Returned to Czechoslovakia===
Pe<U+0159>ina returned to the Czechoslovakia, where his wife Anna had been imprisoned from 1942 to 1945. He became the Commanding Officer of a gunnery school, and became an aerobatic pilot with his own [[B<U+00FC>cker B<U+00FC> 133|B<U+00FC>cker B<U+00FC> 133 Jungmeister]] aerobatic biplane provided by the air ministry. However, as the communists took power and the [[cold war]] developed, there was questioning of the possible westernised loyalty of those pilots who had served with the [[Allies]]. In December [[1949]] after an argument with [[Bed<U+0159>ich Reicin]], Pe<U+0159>ina was expelled from the army and forced to flee again. In April 1949, Pe<U+0159>ina, his wife Anna and a friend of them flew to [[West Germany]], belly landing at [[Passau]], just eight miles from the [[East Germany|Russian zone]].

===Return to the RAF===
After his wife recovered from injuries received during the crash in hospital in [[Wiesbaden]], he rejoined the RAF for five years, but being over 36 was not allowed to fly again. He joined the RAF rifle shooting team, but even after [[Arthur Tedder|Air Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder]] tried to persuade him to stay, Pe<U+0159>ina who had applied to for a United States Visa in London in 1949 emigrated to [[Canada]].<ref name="HN8">[http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3032966.html?page=8&c=y World War II: Interview with Czech Ace Frantisek Perina] HistoryNet Page8</ref>

===North America===
While in Canada he gained a job building fibreglass fishing boats from 1953, but also trained as a commercial pilot - but being over the age of 42, could not find work.<ref name="HN8"/> At Christmas 1959 the couple's US Visa's were granted, and he joined the new plastics division of [[ejection seat]] specialist the [[Weber Aircraft]] in [[Burbank]], [[California]] (later a subsidiary of French based [[Zodiac Group]]). Supervising 347 people, his division made lavatories and kitchens for [[Douglas]], [[Lockheed]] and [[Boeing]] including the [[Boeing 747]]; and seats for the [[Project Gemini]] space capsules.<ref name="HN8"/> Following his retirement on March 15, 1979; Pe<U+0159>ina and his wife retired to [[Arizona]], but finding it too hot quickly moved to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].<ref name="HN8"/>

===Return to Czech Republic===
In [[1993]] Pe<U+0159>ina and his wife returned to Czech Republic, following the removal of the Communist regime. Many citizens, not least those in the newly-emerging military, greeted him with a 'hero's welcome'. Pe<U+0159>ina commented that he simply wants to die on home soil, that it was the country that he fought for and stressed repeatedly that he loves the Czech countryside.<ref name="RadioCZ"/> Having been awarded many Czech and Allied orders and medals, he was made a General of the [[Czech Army]]. 

Pe<U+0159>ina died on Saturday, May 6, [[2006]] aged 95, in Prague<U+2019>s military hospital of an unspecified chronic disease and exhaustion. His wife Anna Pe<U+0159>inov<U+00E1> (n<U+00E9>e Klime<U+0161>ov<U+00E1>) had died several days before his admission to hospital on April 21, Radio Prague reported. One school in Prague has been given his name.<ref>[http://www.zs-perina.cz/stranky/skola_uvod.php ZS Perina School]</ref>
