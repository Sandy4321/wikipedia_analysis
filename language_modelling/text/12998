==Career==
===Club===
====Olimpia Asunci<U+00F3>n====
He joined [[Olimpia Asunci<U+00F3>n]] youth division at the age of nine, where he became the top scorer during several seasons until the head coach of [[Olimpia Asunci<U+00F3>n|Olimpia's]] first team, [[Lu<U+00ED>s Alberto Cubilla|Luis Cubilla]], invited Roque to practice with the first team squad at the age of fifteen. His professional debut on the first team was in 1998, at the age of sixteen. Roque's club performance led Olimpia Asunci<U+00F3>n to a Paraguayan championship in 1998 and 1999, and the winning of the [[Paraguayan Footballer of the Year]] award.

====FC Bayern Munich====
Because of his excellent performances with Olimpia and the [[Paraguay national football team]], Roque signed for Bayern Munich in the second half of 1999. Santa Cruz has been unexceptional at Bayern Munich - although he scored five goals in his first season with the club, a series of injuries and heavy competition at forward for the German giants has limited his impact.

===National team===
====Paraguay U20====
Santa Cruz made a name for himself at the 1999 U-20 [[FIFA World Youth Championship]], where he scored three goals for a surprising Paraguay team. His performance there led to a call-up to the full [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay national team]] for the [[Copa Am<U+00E9>rica]] at the age of 17.

====Paraguay Senior====
Santa Cruz made his senior debut at age 17 for Paraguay at [[Copa Am<U+00E9>rica]] leading his national team in scoring with three goals. He also scored a total of seven goals in the 2002 and 2006 World Cup qualification rounds, and appeared in the [[Football World Cup 2002|2002 World Cup]], where he scored one goal while helping his team advance to the elimination rounds. 

Santa Cruz was in doubt for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] as he was recovering from a serious knee injury. However, he recovered in time for the start of the tournament and played all three group stage matches for Paraguay. Santa Cruz was not able to score a goal, but he did assist [[Nelson Cuevas]] and had a good game in the 2-0 victory over [[Trinidad & Tobago national football team|Trinidad & Tobago]]. Despite the win, Paraguay failed to qualify to the second round of the tournament.
