'''<U+00C6>thelred, Lord of the Mercians''' (or '''Ealdorman <U+00C6>thelred of Mercia''') (died 911) became ruler of English [[Mercia]] shortly after the death of its last king, [[Ceolwulf II of Mercia|Ceolwulf II]] in 879. His rule was confined to the western half, as eastern Mercia was then part of the [[Viking]]-ruled [[Danelaw]]. <U+00C6>thelred's ancestry is unknown. He was probably the leader of an unsuccessful Mercian invasion of Wales in 881, and soon afterwards he acknowledged the lordship of King [[Alfred the Great]] of [[Wessex]]. The alliance was cemented by the marriage of <U+00C6>thelred to Alfred's daughter [[<U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d]].

In 886 Alfred took possession of London, which had suffered greatly from several Viking occupations; as it had traditionally been a Mercian town, he handed control to <U+00C6>thelred. In 892 the Vikings renewed their attacks, and the following year <U+00C6>thelred led an army of Mercians, [[Wessex|West Saxon]]s and Welsh to victory over a Viking army at the [[Battle of Buttington]]. He spent the next three years fighting them alongside Alfred's son, the future King [[Edward the Elder]]. At some time in the decade 899 to 909, <U+00C6>thelred's health may have declined, and <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d may have become the effective ruler of Mercia.

After <U+00C6>thelred's death, <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d ruled as Lady of the Mercians until her own death in 918. The couple's only child, a daughter called [[<U+00C6>lfwynn]], then ruled briefly until deposed by her uncle, King Edward.

==Background==
[[File:England Aethelred 910 EN.svg|right|300px|England in the time of <U+00C6>thelred]]
Mercia was the dominant kingdom in southern England in the eighth century, and maintained its position until it suffered a decisive defeat by King [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]] of Wessex at the [[Battle of Ellandun]] in 825. Egbert briefly conquered Mercia, but it recovered its independence in 830, and thereafter the two kingdoms became allies, which was to be an important factor in English resistance to the Vikings.<ref>Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', pp.&nbsp;11<U+2013>12</ref> The Mercians traditionally held overlordship over Wales, and in 853 King [[Burgred]] of Mercia obtained the assistance of King [[<U+00C6>thelwulf of Wessex|<U+00C6>thelwulf]] of Wessex in an invasion of Wales in order to reassert their hegemony. The same year, Burgred married <U+00C6>thelwulf's daughter.<ref>Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', p. 12; Charles-Edwards, ''Wales and the Britons'', p. 486</ref>

In 865 the Viking [[Great Heathen Army]] landed in [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]], and used it as a starting point for an invasion. The East Anglians were forced to buy peace, and the following year the Vikings invaded [[Northumbria]], where they established an obscure Englishman called [[Ecgberht I of Northumbria|Egbert]] as puppet king in 867. They then moved on to [[Nottingham]] in Mercia, where they spent the winter of 867<U+2013>868. Burgred was joined by King [[<U+00C6>thelred of Wessex|<U+00C6>thelred]] of [[Wessex]] and his brother, the future King Alfred, for a combined attack on the Vikings, but they refused an engagement and in the end the Mercians bought peace with them. The following year, the Vikings conquered East Anglia.<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp.&nbsp;247<U+2013>248</ref> They returned to Mercia in 872; two years later they expelled Burgred, and Ceolwulf became king with their support. Ceolwulf was described by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' as "a foolish king's [[thegn]]" who was a puppet of the Vikings, but the historian [[Ann Williams (historian)|Ann Williams]] regards this view as partial and distorted: he was accepted as a true king by the Mercians and by King Alfred.<ref name=WilliamsCeolwulf/>

In 877 the Vikings divided Mercia, taking the eastern part for themselves and leaving Ceolwulf with the west.<ref name=WilliamsCeolwulf>Williams, "Ceolwulf"</ref><ref name=Costambeys/> The Vikings went on to attack Wessex, leaving Ceolwulf free to renew Mercian claims of hegemony in Wales. At almost the same time as Alfred's victory over the Vikings in 878 at the [[Battle of Edington]], Ceolwulf defeated and killed [[Rhodri Mawr]], king of the north Welsh territory of [[Gwynedd]].<ref>Charles-Edwards, ''Wales and the Britons'', pp.&nbsp;486<U+2013>488</ref> After Ceolwulf's disappearance in 879, Mercia began to fall under the hegemony of Wessex.<ref name=WilliamsCeolwulf/>

[[File:Charter S349.jpg|thumb|Charter S 349<ref>S 349</ref> of Alfred the Great, witnessed by <U+00C6>thelred, described by Keynes and Lapidge as "a magnificently blatant forgery"<ref>Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', p. 235, n. 28</ref>]]
<U+00C6>thelred's descent is unknown, and he does not appear to have been closely related to his immediate predecessors, although his name suggests possible descent from earlier Mercian kings.<ref name=Bailey112-113>Bailey, "<U+00C6>lfwynn", pp.&nbsp;112<U+2013>113</ref> He may have been related to King Alfred's Mercian father-in-law, <U+00C6>thelred Mucel, and brother-in-law, <U+00C6>thelwulf, who appears to have been a member of <U+00C6>thelred's court from the mid 880s.<ref name=Abels181/><ref><U+00C6>thelwulf 21, PASE</ref> <U+00C6>thelred may have been the man of the same name who attested two Mercian charters in the late 860s,<ref name=Keynes19>Keynes, "King Alfred and the Mercians", p. 19</ref> but he is not listed in the two surviving charters of Ceolwulf. Lists of witnesses to charters show that <U+00C6>thelred's [[witan]] (council) shared bishops and at least two [[ealdormen]] with Ceolwulf, but Celowulf's thegns all disappeared.<ref name=Abels181>Abels, ''Alfred the Great'', p. 181</ref>

It is not known when <U+00C6>thelred took over following Ceolred's death or disappearance, but in the view of [[Thomas Charles-Edwards]], a historian of medieval Wales, <U+00C6>thelred was almost certainly "Edryd Long-Hair", the leader of a Mercian army which invaded Gwynedd in 881, and was defeated by Rhodri Mawr's sons at the [[Battle of the Conwy]]. This was described by Welsh annals as "revenge by God for Rhodri". The defeat forced <U+00C6>thelred to abandon his ambitions in north Wales, but he continued to exercise overlordship over the south-eastern Welsh kingdoms of [[Glywysing]] and [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]].<ref>Charles-Edwards, ''Wales and the Britons'', pp.&nbsp;490<U+2013>491</ref> According to Alfred's Welsh biographer [[Asser]], <U+00C6>thelred's "might and tyrannical behaviour" forced these kingdoms to submit to the protection of King Alfred's lordship.<ref>Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', pp. 96, 262<U+2013>263, n. 183</ref> By 883, <U+00C6>thelred had accepted Alfred's lordship. Charles-Edwards suggests that in 881<U+2013>882 he tried to maintain his dominance in south-east Wales, but Alfred offered his protection to Glywysing and Gwent, and in 882<U+2013>883 <U+00C6>thelred accepted that West Saxon power made continued independence impossible. Charles-Edwards comments:
:The implication of all this is that the Mercian submission to Alfred&nbsp;<U+2013> a crucial step in the creation of a single English kingdom&nbsp;<U+2013> occurred not just because of one battle, Alfred's victory over the Great Army at Edington in 878, but also because of another, more distant battle, "God's revenge" on the Mercians at [[River Conwy|the Conwy]], when Anarawd of Gwynedd and his brothers defeated <U+00C6>thelred and so brought about that collapse of the Mercian hegemony in Wales from which Alfred was only too pleased to benefit.<ref>Charles-Edwards, ''Wales and the Britons'', p. 493</ref>

When <U+00C6>thelred made a grant to [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]] Abbey in 883, he did it with the approval of King Alfred, thus acknowledging Alfred's lordship.<ref name=Costambeys/> Thereafter he usually acted with Alfred's permission, but issued some charters in his own name without reference to Alfred, such as at a meeting in [[Princes Risborough|Risborough]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] in 884, showing that English Mercia extended quite far south-east towards London.<ref>Keynes, "King Alfred and the Mercians", pp.&nbsp;20<U+2013>21, 29</ref>

After the Battle of Edington in 878, Alfred established a network of fortified settlements, called [[burh]]s, in Wessex to protect his people and territory against Viking attacks, and when <U+00C6>thelred accepted Alfred's lordship the burhs were extended into Mercia. One of the burhs was [[Worcester]], where <U+00C6>thelred worked with its bishop and used the standing Roman walls in the town's defences. Over the next two generations Worcester was transformed from an ecclesiastical settlement to a town with a diverse population of craftsmen.<ref>Fleming, ''Britain after Rome'', pp.&nbsp;246<U+2013>248</ref>

London suffered severely from Viking attacks and was several times occupied by Viking armies. In 886 Alfred took possession of London, and according to Asser he "restored" the city and "made it habitable again". He then handed control to <U+00C6>thelred.<ref>Fleming, ''Britain after Rome'', pp. 242, 253<U+2013>255; Abels, ''Alfred the Great'', pp. 174<U+2013>176</ref> Historians, however, disagree about the circumstances.<ref>Keynes, "King Alfred and the Mercians", p. 22</ref> According to [[Frank Stenton]], Alfred recovered London by force from the Vikings and handed it to <U+00C6>thelred because it had previously been a Mercian town, and he respected the traditions of other kingdoms.<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp.&nbsp;258<U+2013>259</ref> Marios Costambeys takes a similar view, arguing that Alfred's decision was probably due to the need to maintain unity among the English who were outside Viking territory.<ref name=Costambeys/> [[Alfred Smyth]] suggests that the ''Chronicle's'' account reflects bias in Alfred's favour, and that <U+00C6>thelred took charge because he had a greater role in London's recovery than the West Saxon chronicler was willing to admit.<ref>Smyth, ''King Alfred the Great'', p. 519</ref> Some versions of the ''Chronicle'' state that Alfred besieged London in 883, and [[Simon Keynes]] argues that Alfred probably took London at that time and that the "occupation" in 886 may have been a restoration of London's defences following Viking attacks close to the city in 885.<ref>Keynes, "King Alfred and the Mercians", pp.&nbsp;21<U+2013>24</ref>

Anglo-Saxon London, called [[Anglo-Saxon London|Lundenwic]], was located a mile west of Roman [[Londinium]], but Lundenwic was undefended, and the restoration was carried out inside the walls of the old Roman city, especially an area close to the [[River Thames]] now called [[Queenhithe]], but which was then known as ''<U+00C6>thelred's Hythe'' after its Mercian ruler. <U+00C6>thelred moved quickly to restore the area; in 889 he and Alfred granted property there to the [[Bishop of Worcester]], and in 899 they made another grant to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Both bishops were, like <U+00C6>thelred, Mercians and strong allies of King Alfred, who had the right to all tolls from markets along the river bank.<ref>Fleming, ''Britain after Rome'', pp.&nbsp;254<U+2013>256</ref>

After the restoration of London, Alfred received the submission of "all the English people who were not under subjection to the Danes",<ref>Keynes, "King Alfred and the Mercians", pp.&nbsp;24<U+2013>25</ref> and the alliance between Wessex and Mercia was cemented by the marriage of <U+00C6>thelred to Alfred's oldest daughter, <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d. She is first recorded as <U+00C6>thelred's wife in a charter of 887, but Keynes thinks that the marriage may have taken place two or three years earlier,<ref>Keynes, "King Alfred and the Mercians", p. 27</ref> and the historian Maggie Bailey dates it to between 882 and 887, with the most likely political context being the occupation of London in 886.<ref name=Bailey112-113/> <U+00C6>thelred was probably much older than his wife.<ref name=Costambeys>Costambeys, "<U+00C6>thelred"</ref> They had a daughter, <U+00C6>lfwynn, and according to the twelfth century chronicler, [[William of Malmesbury]], she was their only child.<ref name=Bailey113>Bailey, "<U+00C6>lfwynn", p. 113</ref> In King Alfred's will, drawn up in the 880s, <U+00C6>thelred was left a sword worth 100 [[mancus]]es.<ref>Keynes and Lapidge, ''Alfred the Great'', pp. 177, 313, 323, n. 91</ref>

In 892, two Viking armies attacked eastern England, and <U+00C6>thelred took part in the defence. After the defeat of one Viking leader, [[Hastein]], Alfred became godfather to one of Hastein's two sons and <U+00C6>thelred to the other. Soon afterwards, the English captured Hastein's wife and children, but they were returned to him because the sons were godsons of the English leaders.<ref name=Costambeys/><ref>Charles-Edwards, "Alliances, Godfathers", p. 57</ref> In 893, <U+00C6>thelred brought troops from London to join Alfred's son Edward against a Viking army at [[Thorney, Buckinghamshire|Thorney]] in Buckinghamshire, but the Vikings were too strong for a direct attack so they were allowed to leave English territory. Later in the year, a larger Viking force marched from Essex through Mercia to the Welsh border, followed by <U+00C6>thelred with a joint force of Mercians and West Saxons. Welsh kings joined <U+00C6>thelred to meet the Vikings at the Battle of Buttington, where according to Smyth "these invaders were utterly routed&nbsp;... in what was the most decisive battle in the war", although Marios Costambeys states that the Vikings eventually cut their way out and retreated back to Essex.<ref name=Costambeys/><ref>Smyth, ''Scandinavian York and Dublin'', pp.&nbsp;33<U+2013>35</ref> The Viking army finally dispersed in 896. For much of the time, Alfred had been in the [[west country]] defending [[Devon]]shire, and in the view of Richard Abels: "King Alfred had little to do directly with the great victories enjoyed by the English in 893<U+2013>896. His son, Edward, and his ealdormen, in particular his son-in-law, <U+00C6>thelred, had won the glory."<ref>Abels, ''Alfred the Great'', pp.&nbsp;304<U+2013>305</ref>

In the last years of the ninth century, three sub-ealdormen ruled Mercia under <U+00C6>thelred. <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d's uncle, <U+00C6>thelwulf, controlled western and possibly central Mercia, while the south and east were ruled by [[<U+00C6>thelfrith of Mercia|<U+00C6>thelfrith]], the father of [[<U+00C6>thelstan Half-King]]. Alhhelm was responsible for the lands bordering the northern Danelaw. <U+00C6>thelwulf and Alhhelm are not recorded after the turn of the century, and <U+00C6>thelfrith may have been <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d's chief lieutenant when <U+00C6>thelred's health collapsed soon afterwards.<ref name=Hart116/> Keynes sees <U+00C6>thelfrith as an ealdorman of West Saxon origin, probably appointed by Alfred to look after his interests in south-east Mercia.<ref>Keynes, "King Alfred and the Mercians", p. 21, n. 90</ref>

Evidence from charters show that <U+00C6>thelred and <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d supported religious communities. In 883 they freed Berkeley Abbey from obligations to the king's ''feorm'' (payments in kind), and in 887 they confirmed the possession of land and transferred manpower to [[Pyrton]] Minster in Oxfordshire. In 901 they gave land to [[Wenlock Priory|Much Wenlock Abbey]], and donated a gold chalice weighing thirty mancuses in honour of its former abbess, [[Mildburh|Saint Mildburgh]].{{efn|No original charter of Edward survives, and S 221,<ref>S 221</ref> in which <U+00C6>thelred and <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d granted land to Much Wenlock Abbey, is the only original to survive from his reign.<ref>Lapidge, ''Anglo-Latin Literature'', p. 13</ref>}} In 903 they negotiated a settlement over a former monastic estate which the bishops of Worcester had been trying to recover since the 840s, and [[Werferth|Bishop W<U+00E6>rferth]] wrote "we never could get anywhere until <U+00C6>thelred became lord of the Mercians".<ref>Blair, ''The Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'', p. 306; Baxter, ''The Earls of Mercia'', p. 179</ref>

===Later life===
Some historians believe that at an unknown time in the decade 899 to 909, <U+00C6>thelred's health collapsed and <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d became the effective ruler of Mercia.<ref name=Costambeys/> Cyril Hart and Maggie Bailey believe that it occurred by 902. Bailey cites "Mercian Register"{{efn|The "Mercian Register" (also known as the "Annals of <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d") is the name given by historians to entries from 902 to 924 in several versions of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' which report events from a Mercian point of view, counteracting the West Saxon bias of the "Main Chronicle".<ref>Keynes, "Edward, King of the Anglo-Saxons", pp.&nbsp;42<U+2013>43</ref>}} entries from 902 showing <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d acting alone or in conjunction with Edward in military operations.<ref name=Bailey113/><ref name=Hart116>Hart, "Athelstan Half King", p. 116</ref> Irish annals called the ''Three Fragments'' also suggest that <U+00C6>thelred was unable to take an active part in government from about 902,<ref>Wainwright, "Aethelfl<U+00E6>d, Lady of the Mercians", pp.&nbsp;308<U+2013>309</ref> although he did attend a meeting in 903 with King Edward, <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d and <U+00C6>lfwynn.<ref>Keynes, "Edward, King of the Anglo-Saxons", pp.&nbsp;52<U+2013>54</ref> In 1998 Keynes suggested that <U+00C6>thelred may have been incapacitated by illness at the end of his life,<ref>Keynes, "King Alfred and the Mercians", p. 37, n. 159</ref> but in a summary of his career in 2014 Keynes does not mention this, stating that <U+00C6>thelred and <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d cooperated with King Edward in campaigns against the Vikings.<ref name=Keynes1999/> Martin Ryan also makes no mention of a decline in <U+00C6>thelred's health, describing him as joining Edward in encouraging thegns to purchase land in Viking territories.<ref>Ryan, "Conquest, Reform and the Making of England", pp. 296<U+2013>299</ref> In Michael Livingston's view, he campaigned with Edward in Northumbria in 909, and may have died as a result of wounds sustained at the [[Battle of Tettenhall]] in 910.<ref>Livingston, "The Roads to Brunanburh", pp.&nbsp;5<U+2013>6</ref>

According to William of Malmesbury, King Edward's eldest son, the future King [[<U+00C6>thelstan]], was sent to be brought up at the court of <U+00C6>thelred and <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d after Edward re-married in about 900. This is supported by one independent piece of evidence. According to a transcript dating from 1304 in York's archives, in 925 <U+00C6>thelstan gave a grant of privileges to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]] in [[Gloucester]] "according to a pact of paternal piety which formerly he pledged with <U+00C6>thelred, ealdorman of the people of the Mercians". When King Edward died in 924, <U+00C6>thelstan initially faced opposition at the West Saxon court, but was accepted as king in Mercia.<ref>Foot, ''<U+00C6>thelstan'', pp. 34, 206</ref>

After <U+00C6>thelred's death in 911, <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d ruled as "Lady of the Mercians", but she did not inherit the Mercian territories of London and Oxford, which were taken by Edward. <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d died in 918, and their daughter <U+00C6>lfwynn briefly ruled Mercia until deposed by Edward the Elder, who took the territory under his direct control.<ref>Costambeys, "<U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d"</ref>
[[File:St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester - geograph.org.uk - 443171.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester]], where <U+00C6>thelred and <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d were buried|240px]]

===St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester===
Gloucester seems to have been the main seat of <U+00C6>thelred's and <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d's power,<ref>Keynes, "England, c.900<U+2013>1016", p. 462</ref> and before 900 they founded a new minster there, dedicated to St Peter. In 909 a West Saxon and Mercian army raided Viking territory and seized the bones of the Northumbrian king and martyr, [[Oswald of Northumbria|St Oswald]], from [[Bardney]] in Lincolnshire. The bones were translated to the new Gloucester minster, which was renamed St Oswald's Priory in his honour. Both <U+00C6>thelred and <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d were buried there.<ref>Heighway, "Gloucester and the new minster of St Oswald", pp. 103, 108</ref> The historian Martin Ryan sees the new minster as something like a Mercian royal mausoleum, to replace the one at [[Repton]] destroyed by the Vikings.<ref>Ryan, "Conquest, Reform and the Making of England", p. 298</ref>

==<U+00C6>thelred's status==
<U+00C6>thelred's status is unclear, and this is reflected in the varying titles given to him by different historians. He is sometimes called "ealdorman",<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 259; Heighway, "Gloucester and the new minster of St Oswald", p. 102</ref> but also "Lord of the Mercians"<ref name=Keynes1999>Keynes, "<U+00C6>thelred"</ref><ref name=Williams/> and "subking".<ref>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 212</ref> Coinage issued in English Mercia in Ceolred's time named him as king, but in <U+00C6>thelred's time it named the West Saxon king,<ref>Lyon, "The Coinage of Edward the Elder", p. 67</ref> yet <U+00C6>thelred issued some charters in his own name, implying royal authority.<ref name=Williams>Williams, "<U+00C6>thelred"</ref> West Saxon sources refer to him as an ealdorman, emphasising Mercian subordination to the West Saxon monarchy, whereas Mercian ones describe him as Lord of the Mercians, and Celtic ones sometimes as King of Mercia.<ref name=Bailey113/><ref>Keynes, "Edward, King of the Anglo-Saxons", p. 43</ref> The late tenth-century chronicler [[<U+00C6>thelweard (historian)|<U+00C6>thelweard]], who used sources independent of surviving versions of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', called him "King of the Mercians".<ref name=Costambeys/>

King Edward's influence over Mercia is unclear, and he may have had less power than his father. Edward's charters show <U+00C6>thelred and <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d as accepting his royal authority, but their own charters make no reference to an overlord, and some use expressions such as "holding, governing and defending the sole rule of the Mercians", which come close to describing them as king and queen.<ref>Ryan, "Conquest, Reform and the Making of England", pp.&nbsp;296<U+2013>298</ref>

[[Pauline Stafford]] comments that "Alfred's dominance in the 890s over <U+00C6>thelred, Lord of the Mercians, was as debatable at the time as it still is."<ref>Stafford, "'The Annals of <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d', p. 112</ref>
In the view of Ann Williams, "though he accepted West Saxon overlordship, <U+00C6>thelred behaved rather as a king of Mercia than an ealdorman",<ref name=Williams/> and Charles Insley states that Mercia remained an independent kingdom until 920.<ref>Insley, "Southumbria", pp.&nbsp;329<U+2013>330</ref> To the Welsh and Irish looking east, Mercian rulers still kept all their old regality until <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d's death in 918, and Nick Higham argues that: "Celtic visions of <U+00C6>thelred and <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d as king and queen certainly offer a different, and equally valid, contemporary take on the complex politics of this transition to a new English state."<ref>Charles-Edwards, ''Wales and the Britons'', p. 494; Higham,  "Endpiece", p. 308</ref>

Keynes takes the West Saxon view, arguing that Alfred created the "kingdom of the Anglo-Saxons", inherited by his son Edward the Elder in 899, and <U+00C6>thelred ruled Mercia under the king. Keynes points out that according to Asser, the Welsh king [[Anarawd ap Rhodri|Anarawd]] submitted to Alfred on the same terms as <U+00C6>thelred<U+2014>"Namely that in every respect he would be obedient to the royal will". Keynes regards the designation "K. [King] <U+00C6>thelred II" in the ''Handbook of British Chronology'' as a "delightfully provocative" extension of the "received wisdom" that Mercia retained a real measure of independence in <U+00C6>thelred's time.<ref>Keynes, "Edward, King of the Anglo-Saxons", pp.&nbsp;40<U+2013>62</ref><ref>Fryde, ''Handbook of British Chronology'', p. 17</ref>{{efn|[[<U+00C6>thelred of Mercia|<U+00C6>thelred I]] was King of Mercia in the late seventh century.}} However, Keynes also says:
:<U+00C6>thelred usually acted with the permission of or in association with King Alfred, but occasionally he acted independently of him. Although sometimes described as plain ''dux'' or ealdorman, his status was clearly quite different from that of other ''duces'', for he is also accorded styles which aspire to divine grace and which appear to verge on the royal. In other words, there is no mistaking that the Mercians retained a conception of their ruler as a rightful successor to earlier kings, and a conception of their land as a kingdom with its own identity; but there is also no mistaking that <U+00C6>thelred moved in an Alfredian world.<ref>Keynes, "King Alfred and the Mercians", p. 29</ref>
