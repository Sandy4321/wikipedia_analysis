'''Sigmund Freud''' ([[May 6]], [[1856]]&ndash;[[September 23]], [[1939]]; ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA pronunciation]]: [{{IPA|<U+02C8>zi<U+02D0>km<U+028A>nt <U+02C8>fr<U+0254><U+028F>t}}]) was an [[Austria|Austrian]] [[neurology|neurologist]] and the founder of the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic school]] of [[psychology]]. Freud is best known for his studies of [[sexual desire]], [[Psychological repression|repression]], and the [[unconscious mind]]. 

The name Freud is generally [[pronounced]] [{{IPA|f<U+0279><U+0254><U+026A>d}}] in [[English language|English]] and [{{IPA|fr<U+0254><U+028F>t}}] in [[German language|German]]. He is commonly referred to as "[[List of people known as father or mother of something|the father of psychoanalysis]]" and his work has been tremendously influential in the popular imagination&ndash;popularizing such notions as the unconscious, [[defence mechanism]]s, [[Freudian slips]] and [[dream symbolism]] <U+2013> while also making a long-lasting impact on fields as diverse as [[literature]], [[film]], [[Marxism|marxist]] and [[feminist]] theories, [[literary criticism]], [[philosophy]], and of course, [[psychology]].

==Life==
[[Image:Sigmund-Freud-1907.jpg|thumb|200px|Sigmund Freud, 1907]]

'''Sigismund Schlomo Freud''' was born into a [[Jew]]ish family in Freiberg ([[P<U+0159><U+00ED>bor]]), [[Moravia]], in the [[Austrian Empire]] (now belonging to the [[Czech Republic]]). In 1877, at the age of 21, he abbreviated his given name to "Sigmund." Although he was the first-born of three brothers and five sisters among his mother's children, Sigmund had older half-brothers from his father's previous marriage. His family had limited finances and lived in a crowded apartment, but his parents made every effort to foster his intellect (often favoring Sigmund over his siblings), which was apparent from an early age. Sigmund was ranked first in his class in six of eight years of schooling. He went on to attend the [[University of Vienna]] at 17, from 1873 to 1881. 

Overall, little is known of Freud's early life, as he destroyed his personal papers at least twice, once in 1885 and again in 1907. Additionally, his later papers were closely guarded in the [[Sigmund Freud Archives]] and were only made available to his official biographer [[Ernest Jones]] and a few other members of the inner circle of [[psychoanalysis]].

In 1886, Freud returned to [[Vienna]] and, after opening a private practice specializing in nervous and brain disorders, he married.  He experimented with [[hypnotism]] with his most hysteric and [[neurosis|neurotic]] patients, but he eventually gave up the practice.  He found that he could get his patients to talk by putting them on a couch and encouraging them to say whatever came into their minds (a practice termed [[free association (psychology)|free association]]).

In his 40s, Freud "had numerous [[Psychosomatic illness|psychosomatic]] disorders as well as exaggerated [[fear]]s of dying and other [[phobia]]s" (Corey, 2001, p. 67). During this time, Freud was involved in the task of exploring his own dreams, memories and the dynamics of his [[personality]] development. During this self-analysis, he came to realize the hostility he felt towards his father (Jacob Freud) and "he also recalled his childhood sexual feelings for his mother ([[Amalia Freud]]), who was attractive, warm, and protective" (Corey, 2001, p. 67). Corey (2001) considers this time of emotional difficulty to be the most creative time in Freud's life.

After publishing successful books on the unconscious mind in 1900 and 1901, Freud was appointed to a professorship at the University of Vienna, where he began to develop a loyal following.

Freud had little tolerance for colleagues who diverged from his psychoanalytic doctrines.  He attempted to expel those who disagreed with the movement or even refused to accept certain central aspects of his theory (Corey, 2001): the most notable examples are [[Carl Jung]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]].  Freud wrote a stinging attack on both Jung and [[Alfred Adler]] in a piece called "On the History of the Psycho-Analytic Movement."

In 1930, Freud was awarded the [[Goethe Prize]] by the city of Frankfurt, in recognition of his contributions to psychology.  His mother died the same year, at the age of ninety-five.  In 1933, as Hitler and the Nazis seized power in Germany, Freud's books were burnt publicly by the [[Sturmabteilung|S. A.]].

[[Image:Sigmund_Freud_memorial_plaque2.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Memorial plaque of Sigmund Freud at his birthplace in [[P<U+0159><U+00ED>bor]], [[Czech Republic]].]]
Following the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] ''[[Anschluss]]'', Freud fled Austria with his family with the financial help of his patient and friend [[Princess]] [[Marie Bonaparte]]. On [[June 4]], [[1938]], they were allowed across the border into [[France]] and then they traveled from [[Paris]] to [[Hampstead]], [[London]], [[England]], where they lived at 20 Maresfield Gardens (now the [[Freud Museum]]). As he was leaving Germany, [[Gestapo]] forced him to sign a statement that he had been treated respectfully. Freud wrote a statement: "I warmly recommend Gestapo for everyone."

In England, in 1938, Freud's longing to be embraced by society as an important scientist was partly realized when two secretaries of the [[Royal Society]] brought the book of the Society for Freud to sign.  Freud wrote to his friend [[Arnold Zweig]]: "They left a facsimile of the book with me and if you were here I could should show you the signatures from [[Isaac Newton|I. Newton]] to [[Charles Darwin]].  Good company!"

Freud [[tobacco smoking|smoked]] [[cigar]]s for most of his life; even after having his [[jaw]] removed due to [[cancer|malignancy]], he continued to smoke until his death on [[September 23]], [[1939]].  He smoked an entire box of cigars daily.  After contracting cancer of the mouth in 1923 at the age of 67, he underwent over 30 operations to treat the disease, and for several years wore a painful [[prosthesis]] to seal off his mouth from his nasal cavity. In the end, Freud could no longer tolerate the pain associated with his cancer. He requested that his personal physician visit him at his London home for the purpose of helping him end his own life. Freud's death was by a physician-assisted [[morphine]] overdose.

===Family / Descendants===
Sigmund Freud's eldest daughter, [[Anna Freud]], was also a distinguished psychologist, particularly in the fields of child and [[developmental psychology]]. Sigmund is the grandfather of [[painter]] [[Lucian Freud]] and [[comedian]]/[[politician]]/[[writer]] [[Clement Freud]], and the great-grandfather of [[journalist]] [[Emma Freud]], [[fashion designer]] [[Bella Freud]] and media magnates [[Matthew Freud]] and [[Ria Willems]].
Sigmund Freud was also both a blood uncle and an uncle-in-law to [[public relations]] and [[propaganda]] wizard [[Edward Bernays]]. Bernays's mother, Anna Freud Bernays, was sister to Sigmund.  Bernays's father, Ely Bernays, was brother to Sigmund's wife, Martha Bernays Freud.

==Innovations==
Freud has been influential in two related but distinct ways.  He simultaneously developed a theory of the human [[mind]] and human [[behavior]], as well as clinical techniques for attempting to help [[neurotic]]s.

===Early work===
A lesser known interest of Freud's was [[neurology]].  He was an early researcher on the topic of [[cerebral palsy]], then known as "cerebral paralysis."  He published several medical papers on the topic and showed that the disease existed far before other researchers in his day began to notice and study it.  He also suggested that [[William Little (English surgeon)|William Little]], the man who first identified cerebral palsy, was wrong about lack of [[oxygen]] during the birth process being a cause.  Instead, he suggested that complications in birth were only a symptom of the problem.  It was not until the [[1980s]] that Freud's speculations were confirmed by more modern research.

Freud was an early user and proponent of [[cocaine]] as a stimulant. He wrote several articles on the [[antidepressant]] qualities of the drug and he was influenced by his friend and confidant [[Wilhelm Fliess]], who recommended cocaine for the treatment of the "nasal reflex neurosis." Fliess operated on Freud and a number of Freud's patients whom he believed to be suffering from the disorder, including [[Emma Eckstein]], whose surgery proved disastrous. 

Freud felt that cocaine would work as a cure-all for many disorders and wrote a well-received paper, "On Coca," explaining its virtues. He prescribed it to his friend [[Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow]] to help him overcome a morphine [[addiction]] he had acquired while treating a disease of the nervous system. Freud also recommended it to many of his close family and friends. He narrowly missed out on obtaining [[scientific priority]] for discovering cocaine's [[anesthesia|anesthetic]] properties (of which Freud was aware but on which he had not written extensively), after [[Karl Koller]], a colleague of Freud's in Vienna, presented a report to a medical society in 1884 outlining the ways in which cocaine could be used for delicate [[eye]] surgery. Freud was bruised by this, especially because this would turn out to be one of the few safe uses of cocaine, as reports of addiction and overdose began to filter in from many places in the world. Freud's medical reputation became somewhat tarnished because of this early enthusiasm. Furthermore, Freud's friend Fleischl-Marxow developed an acute case of "cocaine psychosis" as a result of Freud's prescriptions and died a few years later. Freud felt great regret over these events, which later biographers have dubbed "The Cocaine Incident." 

Freud hoped that his research would provide a solid scientific basis for his therapeutic technique.  The goal of Freudian therapy, or [[psychoanalysis]], was to bring to [[consciousness]] repressed thoughts and feelings.  According to some of his successors, including his daughter Anna Freud, the goal of therapy is to allow the patient to develop a stronger [[Ego, super-ego, and id|ego]]; according to others, notably [[Jacques Lacan]], the goal of therapy is to lead the [[analysand]] to a full acknowledgement of his or her inability to satisfy the most basic desires.  

Classically, the bringing of unconscious thoughts and feelings to consciousness is brought about by encouraging the patient to talk in free association and to talk about dreams.  Another important element of psychoanalysis is a relative lack of direct involvement on the part of the analyst, which is meant to encourage the patient to project thoughts and feelings onto the analyst.  Through this process, [[transference]], the patient can reenact and resolve repressed conflicts, especially childhood conflicts with (or about) parents.

===The unconscious===

Perhaps the most significant contribution Freud has made to modern thought is his conception of the dynamic [[unconscious]]. During the 19th century, the dominant trend in [[western world|Western]] thought was [[positivism]], the belief that people could ascertain real knowledge concerning themselves and their environment and judiciously exercise control over both. Freud, however, suggested that such declarations of free will are in fact delusions; that we are not entirely aware of what we think and often act for reasons that have little to do with our conscious thoughts. The concept of the unconscious was groundbreaking in that he proposed that awareness existed in layers and that there were thoughts occurring "below the surface." [[Dream]]s, which he called the "royal road to the unconscious", provided the best access to our unconscious life and the best illustration of its "logic", which was different from the logic of conscious thought. Freud developed his first [[topology]] of the psyche in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1899) in which he proposed the argument that the unconscious exists and described a method for gaining access to it. The [[preconscious]] was described as a layer between conscious and unconscious thought&mdash;that which we could access with a little effort. Thus for Freud, the ideals of [[the Enlightenment]], positivism and rationalism, could be achieved through understanding, transforming, and mastering the unconscious, rather than through denying or repressing it.

Crucial to the operation of the unconscious is "[[Psychological repression|repression]]." According to Freud, people often experience thoughts and feelings that are so painful that people cannot bear them. Such thoughts and feelings&mdash;and associated memories&mdash;could not, Freud argued, be banished from the mind, but could be banished from consciousness.  Thus they come to constitute the unconscious. Although Freud later attempted to find patterns of repression among his patients in order to derive a general model of the mind, he also observed that individual patients repress different things. Moreover, Freud observed that the process of repression is itself a non-conscious act (in other words, it did not occur through people willing away certain thoughts or feelings). Freud supposed that what people repressed was in part determined by their unconscious. In other words, the unconscious was for Freud both a cause and effect of repression.

Later, Freud distinguished between three concepts of the unconscious: the [[descriptive unconscious]], the [[dynamic unconscious]], and the [[system unconscious]]. The descriptive unconscious referred to all those features of mental life of which we are not subjectively aware.  The dynamic unconscious, a more specific [[social construct|construct]], referred to mental process and contents which are defensively removed from consciousness as a result of conflictual forces or "dynamics". The system unconscious denoted the idea that when mental processes are repressed, they become organized by principles different from those of the conscious mind, such as condensation and displacement.  

Eventually, Freud abandoned the idea of the system unconscious, replacing it with the concept of the [[Ego, super-ego, and id]] (discussed below). Throughout his career, however, he retained the descriptive and dynamic conceptions of the unconscious.

===Psychosexual development===
{{main|Psychosexual development}}
Freud also believed that the [[libido]] developed in individuals by changing its object, a process designed by the concept of ''[[sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]''.  He argued that humans are born "polymorphously perverse", meaning that any number of objects could be a source of pleasure. He further argued that, as humans developed, they become fixated on different and specific objects through their stages of development&mdash;first in the [[oral stage]] (exemplified by an infant's pleasure in nursing), then in the [[anal stage]] (exemplified by a toddler's pleasure in controlling his or her bowels), then in the [[phallic stage]]. Freud argued that children then passed through a stage in which they fixated on the mother as a sexual object (known as the [[Oedipus Complex]]) but that the child eventually overcame and repressed this desire because of its taboo nature. (The lesser known [[Electra complex]] refers to such a fixation upon the father.) 

Freud hoped to prove that his model was universally valid and thus turned to ancient [[mythology]] and contemporary ethnography for comparative material. Freud named his new theory the [[Oedipus complex]] after the famous [[Greek tragedy]] ''[[Oedipus the King|Oedipus Rex]]'' by [[Sophocles]].  <U+201C>I found in myself a constant love for my mother, and jealousy of my father. I now consider this to be a universal event in childhood,<U+201D> Freud said. Freud sought to anchor this pattern of development in the dynamics of the mind.  Each stage is a progression into adult sexual maturity, characterized by a strong ego and the ability to delay gratification (cf. ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'').  He used the Oedipus conflict to point out how much he believed that people desire [[incest]] and must repress that desire. The Oedipus conflict was described as a state of psychosexual development and awareness. He also turned to [[cultural anthropology|anthropological]] studies of [[totemism]] and argued that totemism reflected a ritualized enactment of a tribal [[Oedipal conflict]].

It is interesting to note that originally Freud believed childhood [[sexual abuse]] to be the cause of [[hysteria]]&mdash;but he then recanted this so-called "seduction theory" ("[[The Index of Sexual Abuse]]"), claiming that he had found many cases in which apparent memories of childhood sexual abuse were based more on imagination than on real events. Instead he began to emphasize the Oedipus Theory, which asserts that everyone unconsciously wishes to possess their parents.

===Ego, super-ego, and id===
{{main|Ego, super-ego, and id}}
In his later work, Freud proposed that the psyche was divided into three parts: [[Ego, super-ego, and id]]. 
Freud released this structural model of the mind in the 1920 essay ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'', and fully adopted in ''The Ego and The Id'' (1923) as an alternative to his previous topographical scheme (conscious, unconscious, preconscious).

===Defense mechanisms===
According to Freud, the defence mechanisms are the method by which the ego can solve the conflicts between the super-ego and the id. The use of defence mechanisms may attenuate the conflict between the id and super-ego, but their overuse or reuse rather than confrontation can lead to either anxiety or [[guilt]] which may result in psychological disorders such as depression. His daughter Anna Freud had done the most significant work on this field, yet she credited Sigmund with defence mechanisms, as he began the work. The defence mechanisms include: [[denial]], [[reaction formation]], [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]], [[psychological repression|repression]]/[[suppression]] (the proper term), [[psychological projection|projection]], [[intellectualisation]], [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalisation]], compensation, [[sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]] and [[regressive emotionality]].

*''Denial'' occurs when someone fends off awareness of an unpleasant truth or of a reality that is a threat to the ego.  For example, a student may have received a bad grade on a report card but tells himself that grades don't matter. (Some early writers argued for a striking parallel between Freudian denial and [[Nietzsche]]'s ideas of ''[[ressentiment]]'' and the ''revaluation of values'' that he attributed to "herd" or "slave" morality.)
*''Reaction formation'' takes place when a person takes the opposite approach consciously compared to what that person wants unconsciously.  For example, someone may engage in violence against another race because, that person claims, the members of the race are inferior, when unconsciously it is that very person who feels inferior.
*''Displacement'' takes place when someone redirects emotion from a "dangerous" object to a "safe" one, such as punching a pillow to avoid hitting a friend.
*''Repression'' occurs when an experience is so painful (such as war trauma) that it is unconsciously forced from consciousness, while ''suppression'' is a conscious effort to do the same.
*''Psychological projection'' occurs when a person "projects" his or her own undesirable thoughts, motivations, desires, feelings <U+2014> basically parts of oneself <U+2014> onto someone or something else.  An example of this would be to say that Alice doesn't like Bob, but rather than to admit she doesn't like Bob, she will project her sentiment onto Bob, saying that Bob doesn't like her.
*''Intellectualisation'' involves removing one's self, emotionally, from a stressful event.  Intellectualisation is often accomplished through rationalisation rather than accepting reality; one may explain it away to remove one's self.
*''Rationalization'' involves constructing a logical justification for a decision that was originally arrived at through a different mental process.  For example, Jim may have bought a tape player to listen to self-help tapes, but he tells his friends he bought it so that he can listen to classic rock mixes for fear of his actual reason being rejected.
*''Compensation'' occurs when someone takes up one behaviour because one cannot accomplish another behaviour.  For example, the second born child may clown around to get attention since the older child is already an accomplished scholar.
*''Sublimation'' is the channeling of impulses to socially accepted behaviours. For instance, the use of a dark, gloomy poem to describe life by such poets as [[Emily Dickinson]].

===The life and death instincts===
Freud believed that humans were driven by two conflicting central desires: the life drive ([[Eros (Freud)|Eros]]) (incorporating the sex drive) and the death drive ([[Thanatos]]). Freud's description of Eros and Libido included all creative, life-producing drives. The [[Death Drive]] (or death instinct) represented an urge inherent in all living things to return to a state of calm, or, ultimately, of non-existence. The presence of the Death Drive was only recognized in his later years, and the contrast between the two represents a revolution in his manner of thinking.

===Social psychology===

[[Image:PICT4139.JPG|thumb|250px|Freud leaves Vienna for exile in London, 1938 (Memorial to the German Resistance, Berlin)]]

Freud gave explanations of the genesis of religion in his writings, included in a reflection on [[crowd psychology]]. In ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' (1913), he proposed that humans originally banded together in <U+201C>primal hordes<U+201D>, consisting of a male, a number of females and the offspring of this [[polygamous]] arrangement. According to Freud<U+2019>s psychoanalytical theory, a male child early in life has sexual desires for his mother <U+2013> the [[Oedipus Complex]] <U+2013> which he held to be [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]]. [[Ethnology|Ethnologists]] would later criticize this point, leading to ethno-psychoanalytic studies. According to Freud, the father is protective, so his sons love him, but they are also jealous of their father for his relationship with their mothers. Finding that individually they cannot defeat the father-leader, they band together, kill and eat him in a ritual meal, thereby ingesting the substance of the father<U+2019>s hated power <U+2013> but their subsequent guilt leads the sons to elevate their father's memory and to worship him. The [[super-ego]] then takes the place of the father as the source of internalized authority.  A ban was then put upon [[incest]] and upon [[marriage]] within the clan, and symbolic animal [[sacrifice]] was substituted for the ritual killing of a human being.

In ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'' (1939) Freud reconstructed biblical history in accord with his general theory, but biblical scholars and historians would not accept his account since it defied the viewpoint of the accepted criteria of historical evidence. However, his point was probably more in proposing a [[just-so story]] and an interpretation of [[leadership]] based on [[mass psychology]], using the [[Prophet]]ic figure of Moses. His ideas about [[religion]] were also developed in ''[[The Future of an Illusion]]'' (1927). When Freud spoke of religion as an [[illusion]], he maintained that it is [[fantastic]] structure from which a man must be set free if he is to grow to [[maturity]]; and in his treatment of the unconscious he moved toward [[atheism]]. In this sense, Freud approached the [[Marxism|Marxist theory]] of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]. Freud isolated two main principles: [[Thanatos]] is the drive towards the disillusion of all life, whereas, [[Eros]] is to strive towards stopping that drive. When one goal is reached, the other becomes out of reach, and vice versa. 

In ''[[Group Psychology]] and Ego Analysis'' (''Massenpsychologie und Ich-Analysis'', 1920), Freud explored crowd psychology, continuing [[Gustave Le Bon]]'s early work. When the individual joins a crowd, he ceases repressing his instincts, and thus relapses into [[primitive culture]], according to Freud's analysis. However, crowds must be distinguished into natural and organized crowds, following [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]]' distinction. Thus, if intellectual skills (the capacity to [[doubt]] and to distance oneself) are systematically reduced when the individual joins a mass, he may eventually be "morally enlightened". Prefiguring ''Moses and Monotheism'' and ''The Future of an Illusion'', he states that the love relationship between the leader and the masses, in the Church or in the Army, are only an "idealist transformation of the conditions existing in the primitive horde". Freud then compares leader's relationship with the crowd to a relation of [[hypnosis]], a force to which he relates [[Mana]]. Pessimistic about humanity's chances of [[liberty]], Freud writes that "the leader of the crowd always incarnate the dreaded primitive father, the crowd always want to be dominated by an illimited power, it is grasping at the highest degree for [[authority]] or, to use [[Gustave Le Bon|Le Bon]]'s expression, it is hungry for subservience".

According to Freud, [[self-identification]] to a common figure, the leader, explained the phenomenon of masses' obedience. Each individual connected themselves vertically to the same ideal figure (or [[idea]]), each one thus have the same self-ideal, and hence identify together (horizontal relation). Freud also quoted [[Wilfred Trotter]]'s ''The Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War'' (1914). Along with ''Moses and Monotheism'', ''Massenpsychologie...'' would be one of the articles most quoted by Wilhelm Reich and the [[Frankfurt School]] in its [[Freudo-Marxism|Freudo-Marxist]] synthesis.

==Freud's legacy==
[[image:1freud-enlargement.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Freud on the Austrian 50-Schilling Note]]

=== Psychotherapy ===
{{main|Psychotherapy}}
Freud's theories and research methods were controversial during his life and remain so today, but few dispute his far-reaching impact on [[psychologists]] and academics.

Most importantly, Freud popularized the "talking-cure"--the notion that a person could be treated simply by talking over his or her problems, which was almost unheard of in the 19th century.  Even though many psychotherapists today partly or wholly reject the specifics of Freud's theories, this basic model of treatment stems largely from his work.

In addition, Freud's development of "unconscious" sources of behavior and his emphasis on motivational structures of the human mind have had a lasting impact on psychological theory and research.  However, most of Freud's specific theories--like his stages of psychosexual development--and especially his methodology, have fallen out of favor in modern experimental psychology.

Some psychotherapists, however, still follow an approximately Freudian system of treatment.  Many more have modified his approach, or joined one of the schools that branched from his original theories (see [[Neo-Freudian]]).  Still others reject his theories entirely, although their practice may still reflect his influence.

[[Psychoanalysis]] today maintains the same ambivalent relationship with medicine and academia that Freud experienced during his life.

=== Philosophy ===
While Freud saw himself as a scientist, his theories have had a tremendous impact on the [[humanities]]--especially on the [[Frankfurt school]] and [[critical theory]].  In addition, many philosophers have discussed his theories and their implications, in the broader context of Western thought.  Freud's model of the mind is often seen as a critical challenge to the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] model of rational [[Human agency|agency]], which was a key element of much [[modern philosophy]].

* '''Rationality'''. While many enlightenment thinkers viewed rationality as both an unproblematic ideal and a defining feature of man, Freud's model of the mind drastically reduced the scope and power of reason.  In Freud's view, reasoning occurs in the conscious mind--the ego--but this is only a small part of the whole.  The mind also contains the hidden, irrational elements of id and superego, which lie outside of conscious control, drive behavior, and motivate conscious activities.  As a result, these structures call into question humans' ability to act purely on the basis of reason, since lurking motives are also always at play.  Moreover, this model of the mind makes rationality itself suspect, since it may be motivated by hidden urges or societal forces (e.g. defense mechanisms, where reasoning becomes "rationalizing").

* '''Transparency of Self'''.  Another common assumption in pre-Freudian philosophy was that people have immediate and unproblematic access to themselves.  Emblematic of this position is [[Ren<U+00E9> Descartes]]'s famous line, "I think therefore I am."  However, for Freud, many central aspects of a person remain radically inaccessible to the conscious mind (without the aid of psychotherapy), which undermines the once unquestionable status of first-person knowledge.

===Critical reactions===
{{Unreferenced}}
Although Freud's theories were quite influential, he never faced a shortage of criticism during his lifetime or afterward, from those who described his theories as inadequate, ludicrous, or repugnant. 

Some critics, like [[Juliet Mitchell]], have suggested that Freud's basic claim <U+2014> that many of our conscious thoughts and actions are driven by unconscious desires and fears <U+2014> should be rejected because it implicitly challenges the possibility of making universal and objective claims about the world.  Some proponents of science conclude that this invalidates Freudian theory as a means of interpreting and explaining human behavior.

Another frequently criticized aspect of Freud's theories is his model of psychosexual development.  Some have attacked Freud's claim that infants are sexual beings, and, implicitly, Freud's expanded notion of sexuality.  Others have accepted Freud's expanded notion of sexuality, but have argued that this pattern of development is not universal, nor necessary for the development of a healthy adult.  Instead, they have emphasized the social and environmental sources of patterns of development.  Moreover, they call attention to social dynamics Freud de-emphasized or ignored, such as class relations.  This branch of Freudian critique owes a great deal to the work of [[Herbert Marcuse]].  

Freud has also come under fire from many [[feminist]] critics. Freud was an early champion of both sexual freedom and education for women (Freud, "[[Civilized Sexual Morality and Modern Nervousness]]"). Some feminists, however, have argued that at worst his views of women's sexual development set the progress of women in [[Western culture]] back decades, and that at best they lent themselves to the ideology of female inferiority. Believing as he did that women are a kind of mutilated male, who must learn to accept their "deformity" (the "lack" of a penis) and submit to some imagined biological imperative, he contributed to the vocabulary of [[misogyny]]. Terms such as "[[penis envy]]" and "[[castration|castrating]]" (both used to describe women who attempted to excel in any field outside the home) contributed to discouraging women from obtaining education or entering any field dominated by men, until the 1970s. 

On the other hand, [[feminist theory|feminist theorists]] such as [[Juliet Mitchell]], [[Nancy Chodorow]], [[Jessica Benjamin]], [[Jane Gallop]], and [[Jane Flax]] have argued that psychoanalytic theory is essentially related to the feminist project and must, like other theoretical traditions, be adapted by women to free it from vestiges of sexism. Freud's views are still being questioned by people concerned about women's equality. Another feminist who finds potential use of Freud's theories in the feminist movement is [[Shulamith Firestone]]. In "Freudianism: The Misguided Feminism", she discusses how Freudianism is essentially completely accurate, with the exception of one crucial detail: everywhere that Freud writes "penis", the word should be replaced with "power". 

Finally, Freud's theories are often criticized for not being real science. This objection was raised most famously by [[Karl Popper]], who claimed that all proper [[scientific theories]] must be potentially [[falsifiable]]. If a theory cannot possibly be falsified, then it cannot be considered [[science|scientific]]. Popper argued that Freud's theories of psychology can never be properly "verified," because no type of behavior could ever falsify them (e.g. someone who denies having any sort of Oedipal conflict is interpreted as repressing it).  However, [[Popper]]'s own theory about falsifiability as the criterion for science has come under criticism, and Freud's theories still have many adherents.

Dr. J. Von Schneidt was the first to propose that most of Freud's psychonalytical theory was a byproduct of his cocaine use. Cocaine enhances dopaminergic neurotransmission increasing sexual interest and obsessive thinking. Chronic cocaine use can produce unusual thinking patterns due to the depletion of dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex.

===Biographies===

The area of biography has been especially contentious in the [[historiography]] of psychoanalysis, for two primary reasons: first, the vast majority of historical material on Freud has been, since his death, made available only at the permission of his biological and intellectual heirs (his daughter, Anna Freud, was extremely protective of her father's reputation); second, much of the data and theory of Freudian psychoanalysis hinges upon the personal testimony of Freud himself, and so to challenge Freud's legitimacy or honesty has been seen by many as an attack on the roots of his enduring work.

The first biographies of Freud were written by Freud himself: his ''On the History of the Psychoanalytic Movement'' (1914) and ''An Autobiographical Study'' (1924) provided much of the basis for discussions by later biographers, including "debunkers" (as they contain a number of prominent omissions and potential misrepresentations). A few of the major biographies on Freud to come out over the 20th century were:
*Helen Walker Puner, ''Freud: His Life and His Mind'' (1947) &mdash; Puner was remarkably insightful on Freud, especially concerning Freud's  unanalyzed relationship to his mother, Amalia. 

* [[Ernest Jones]], ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'', 3 vols. (1953&ndash;1958) &mdash; the first "authorized" biography of Freud, made by one of his former students with the authorization and assistance of Anna Freud, with the hope of "dispelling the myths" from earlier biographies. There can be no doubt that Jones wrote more of a hagiography than a history of Freud. Although correct on the biographical facts of Freud's life, Jones diagnosed his own analyst, Ferenczi, as "psychotic."  In the same breath, Jones also maligned Otto Rank, Ferenczi's close friend and Jones's most important rival for leadership of the movement in the 1920s. These two libels are expressions of a personal vendetta by Jones that seriously harm his reputation for honesty.

* [[Henri F Ellenberger]], ''The Discovery of the Unconscious'' (1970) &mdash; was the first book to, in a compelling way, attempt to situate Freud within the context of his time and intellectual thought, arguing that he was the intellectual heir of [[Franz Mesmer]] and that the genesis of his theory owed a large amount to the political context of turn of the 19th century Vienna. (Swiss link: http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_F._Ellenberger) 

* Frank Sulloway, ''Freud: Biologist of the Mind'' (1979) &mdash; Sulloway, one of the first professional/academic historians to write a biography of Freud, positioned Freud within the larger context of the [[history of science]], arguing specifically that Freud was, in fact, a biologist in disguise (a "crypto-biologist", in Sulloway's terms), and sought to actively hide this.

* [[Peter Gay]], ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1988) &mdash; Gay's work was published as a response to the anti-Freudian literature and the "Freud Wars" of the 1980s (see below).

The creation of Freud biographies has itself even been written about at some length&mdash;see, for example, Elisabeth Young-Bruehl, "A History of Freud Biographies," in ''Discovering the History of Psychiatry'', edited by Mark S. Micale and [[Roy Porter]] (Oxford University Press, 1994).
