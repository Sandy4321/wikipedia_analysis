'''''The Dark Side of the Moon''''' is a [[concept album]] by English [[Progressive rock|progressive rock]] group [[Pink Floyd]]. Released in March 1973, the album built on the ideas Pink Floyd had explored in their live shows and previous recordings, but it lacks the extended instrumental excursions that characterised their work following the departure in 1968 of founding member, principal composer and lyricist, [[Syd Barrett]].  The album's themes include conflict, greed, aging, and [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state.<ref name="makingof">{{Citation | title = Classic Albums: The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon | format = DVD | publisher = Eagle Rock Entertainment | date = 2003-08-26 }}</ref>

The album was developed as part of a forthcoming tour of live performances, and premi<U+00E8>red several months before studio recording began.  The new material was further refined during the tour, and was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London.  Pink Floyd used  some of the most advanced recording techniques of the time, including [[multitrack recording]] and [[tape loop]]s.  [[Analog synthesizer|Analogue synthesizers]] were given prominence in several tracks, and a series of recorded interviews with staff and band personnel provided the source material for a range of philosophical quotations used throughout.  Engineer [[Alan Parsons]] was directly responsible for some of the most notable sonic aspects of the album, including the [[Non-lexical vocables in music|non-lexical]] performance of [[Clare Torry]].

''The Dark Side of the Moon'' was an immediate success, topping the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] for one week.  It subsequently remained on the charts for 741&nbsp;weeks (fourteen years), the longest duration of any album in history.  With an estimated 45&nbsp;million units sold, it is Pink Floyd's most commercially successful album and one of the [[List of best-selling albums worldwide|best-selling albums worldwide]].  It has twice been [[Audio mastering|remastered]] and re-released, and has been covered by several other acts.  It spawned two singles, "[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]" and "[[Us and Them (song)|Us and Them]]".  In addition to its commercial success, ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' is one of Pink Floyd's most popular albums among fans and critics, and is frequently ranked as one of the greatest rock albums of all time.

==Background==
Following the release of ''[[Meddle]]'', in December 1971 the band assembled for an upcoming tour of Britain, Japan, and the United States.  Rehearsing in Broadhurst Gardens in [[London]], there was the looming prospect of a new album although their priority at that time was the creation of new material.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=71&ndash;72.}}</ref>  In a band meeting at drummer [[Nick Mason]]'s home in [[Camden Town|Camden]], bassist [[Roger Waters]] proposed that a new album could form part of the tour.  Waters' idea was for an album dealing with things that "make people mad", focusing on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle and dealing with the apparent mental problems suffered by former band member Syd Barrett.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=165.}}</ref><ref name="darkside30">{{Citation |last=Harris | first=John | title='Dark Side' at 30: Roger Waters  | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/articles/story/5937470/dark_side_at_30_roger_waters | publisher = rollingstone.com | date=2003-03-12 | accessdate=2009-02-18 }}</ref> The band had explored a similar idea with 1969's ''[[The Man and the Journey]]''. In a recent interview for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' David Gilmour said "...&nbsp;I think we all thought<U+2014>and Roger definitely thought<U+2014>that a lot of the lyrics that we had been using were a little too indirect.  There was definitely a feeling that the words were going to be very clear and specific."<ref name="gilmour">{{Citation |first= John|last= Harris |title='Dark Side' at 30: David Gilmour  |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/articles/story/5937468/dark_side_at_30_david_gilmour| publisher = rollingstone.com |date=2003-03-12 |accessdate=2009-02-18 }}</ref>

Generally, all four members agreed that Waters' idea for an album unified by a single theme was a good idea.<ref name="gilmour"/>  Bassist and principal lyricist Roger Waters, guitarist David Gilmour, drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] participated in the writing and [[Record producer|production]] of the new material<U+2014>something of a rarity in later Pink Floyd albums.  Waters created the early [[Demo (music)|demo tracks]] at his [[Islington]] home, in a small recording studio he had built in his garden shed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=166.}}</ref>  Parts of the new album were taken from previously unused material: the opening line of "[[Breathe (Pink Floyd song)|Breathe]]" came from an earlier work by Waters and [[Ron Geesin]] written for the soundtrack of ''[[Music from The Body|The Body]]'';<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=73&ndash;74.}}</ref> the basic structure of "[[Us and Them (song)|Us and Them]]" was taken from a piece originally written for the film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]''.<ref name="makingof"/>  The band rehearsed at a warehouse in London owned by [[The Rolling Stones]], and then at the [[Rainbow (London)|Rainbow Theatre]].  They also purchased extra equipment, including new speakers, a [[Public address|PA system]], a 28-track mixing desk with four [[wikt:quadraphonic|quadraphonic]] outputs, and a custom-built lighting rig.  Nine tonnes of kit was transported in three [[Truck|lorries]]; this would be the first time the band had taken an entire album on tour, but it would allow them to refine and improve the new material,<ref name="Masonp167"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=85&ndash;86.}}</ref> which by then had been given the provisional title of ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' (an allusion to lunacy, rather than astronomy).<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=159.}}</ref>  On discovering that that title had already been used by another band, [[Medicine Head]], it was temporarily changed to ''Eclipse''.

Not annoyed at them but because we wanted to use the title."<U+2014>David Gilmour<ref name="Poveyp154"/>|group="nb"}}

''Dark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics'', as it was now known, was performed in the presence of an assembled press (and [[Bootleg recording|bootleggers]]) on 17 February 1972<U+2014>more than a year before its eventual release<U+2014>at the Rainbow theatre, receiving critical acclaim.<ref name="Poveyp155">{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|pp=154&ndash;155.}}</ref>  Michael Wale of ''[[The Times]]'' described the piece as "...&nbsp;bringing tears to the eyes.

The new material was performed live, in the same order in which it would eventually be recorded, but obvious differences included the lack of [[synthesizer]]s in tracks such as "[[On the Run (Pink Floyd song)|On the Run]]", and [[Bible]] readings in place of [[Clare Torry]]'s vocals on "[[The Great Gig in the Sky]]".<ref name="Poveyp155"/>

The band's 1972&ndash;1973 [[Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon Tour 1972-1973|Dark Side of the Moon Tour]] through Europe and North America gave them the opportunity to make continual improvements to the scale and quality of the performances.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=159.}}</ref>  Studio sessions were squeezed between tour dates; rehearsals began in England on 20&nbsp;January, but in late February the band travelled to France and recorded music for ''[[La Vall<U+00E9>e (film)|La Vall<U+00E9>e]]'', a French film by director [[Barbet Schroeder]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=168.}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|This material was later released under the title ''[[Obscured by Clouds]]''.<ref name="Poveyp155"/>|group="nb"}}  They then performed in [[Japan]] and returned to France in March to complete work on ''La Vall<U+00E9>e''.  After a series of dates in North America, the band flew to London to begin recording the album from 24&nbsp;May to 25&nbsp;June.  More concerts in Europe and North America followed, and also the recording in October of ''[[Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii]]'', before the band again returned on 9&nbsp;January 1973 to complete work on the album.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=157.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|pp=164&ndash;173.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|p=60.}}</ref>

==Concept==
''The Dark Side of the Moon'' builds upon previous experiments Pink Floyd had attempted in their live shows and recordings, but without the extended instrumental excursions which, according to critic [[David Fricke]], had become characteristic of the band after founding member Syd Barrett left in 1968.  Guitarist David Gilmour, Barrett's replacement, would later refer to these instrumentals as "that psychedelic noodling stuff".<ref name="makingof"/>  Gilmour and Waters cite 1971's ''[[Meddle]]'' as a turning-point toward what would be realised on the album.<ref name="makingof"/>

Lyrical themes include conflict, greed, ageing, death, and mental illness (or "insanity"), the latter inspired in part by Barrett's deteriorating mental state; he had been the band's principal composer and lyricist.<ref name="makingof"/>  The album is notable for its use of [[Musique concrete|musique concr<U+00E8>te]] and conceptual, philosophical lyrics, as found in much of the band's other work.

Each side of the album is a continuous piece of music.  The five tracks on each side reflect various stages of human life.  The album begins and ends with a fading heartbeat, explores the nature of the human experience, and according to Waters, "empathy".<ref name="makingof"/>  "[[Speak to Me]]" and "Breathe" together stress the mundane and futile elements of life along with the ever-present threat of madness and the importance of living one's own life<U+2014>"Don't be afraid to care".<ref>{{Harvnb|Whiteley|1992|pp=105&ndash;106.}}</ref>  "On the Run", a synthesizer-driven instrumental, evokes the stress and anxiety of modern travel, in particular Wright's fear of flying, by shifting the scene to an airport.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=78&ndash;79.}}</ref>  "[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]" looks at the manner in which the passage of time can control one's life, followed by a retreat into solitude and withdrawal in "[[Breathe (Reprise)]]".  The first side of the album ends with "The Great Gig in the Sky"&mdash;a soulful metaphor for death.  Opening with the sound of [[cash register]]s and loose change, the first track on side two, "[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]", mocks greed and [[consumerism]], with tongue-in-cheek lyrics and wealth-related [[sound effect]]s.  "Money" has been the most commercially successful track from the album, with several cover versions produced by other bands.<ref>{{Harvnb|Whiteley|1992|p=111.}}</ref>  "[[Us and Them (song)|Us and Them]]" addresses [[ethnocentrism]] and [[conflict]] and the use of simple dichotomies to describe personal relationships.  "[[Brain Damage (song)|Brain Damage]]" looks at a [[mental illness]] resulting from the elevation of fame and success above the needs of the self.  In particular the line "And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes" reflects the mental breakdown of former band-mate Syd Barrett.  The album ends with "[[Eclipse (song)|Eclipse]]", which espouses the concepts of [[alterity]] ("otherness") and unity, while forcing the listener to recognise the common traits shared by humanity.<ref name="Reisingpp181184">{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|pp=181&ndash;184.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Whiteley|1992|p=116.}}</ref>

The album was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]], in two sessions, between May 1972 and January 1973.  The band were assigned staff engineer [[Alan Parsons]], who had previously worked as assistant tape operator on ''[[Atom Heart Mother]]'', and who had also gained experience as a recording engineer on [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Abbey Road (album)|Abbey Road]]'' and ''[[Let It Be]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=171.}}</ref><ref name="anotherphase">{{Citation | title = Another Phase of the Moon page 1 | url = http://www.soundandvisionmag.com/features/444/another-phase-of-the-moon.html | last = Richardson | first = Ken | publisher = soundandvisionmag.com | date = 2003-05 | accessdate = 2009-03-19}}</ref>  The recording sessions made use of the most advanced studio techniques of the time.  The studio was capable of [[Multitrack recording|16-track]] mixes which offered a greater degree of flexibility than the eight or four track mixes they had previously used, although the band would often use so many tracks that to make more space available second generation copies were made.<ref name="Harrispp101102">{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=101&ndash;102.}}</ref>

Beginning on 1&nbsp;June, the first track to be recorded was "Us and Them", followed six days later by "Money".  Waters had created [[Sound effect|effects]] [[Tape loop|loop]]s from recordings of various money-related objects, including coins thrown into a food-mixing bowl taken from his wife's pottery studio. These loops were later re-recorded to take advantage of the band's decision to record a [[Quadraphonic sound|quadraphonic]] mix of the album (Parsons has since expressed dissatisfaction with the result of this mix, attributed to a lack of time and the paucity of available multi-track tape recorders).<ref name="anotherphase"/>  "Time" and "The Great Gig in the Sky" were the next pieces to be recorded, followed by a two-month break during which the band spent time with their families and prepared for an upcoming tour of the US.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=103&ndash;108.}}</ref>  Their recording sessions suffered regular interruptions; Roger Waters, a supporter of [[Arsenal F.C.]], would often break from recording to see his team compete.  The band would occasionally stop work to watch [[Monty Python's Flying Circus]] on the television, leaving Parsons to work on material recorded up to that point.<ref name="Harrispp101102"/>  David Gilmour has since disputed this claim; in an interview in 2003 he said: "We would sometimes watch them but when we were on a roll, we would get on."<ref>{{Citation | title = There is no dark side of the moon, really&nbsp;...| url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/06/23/1056220536301.html | last = Waldon | first = Steve | publisher = theage.com | date = 2003-06-24 | accessdate = 2009-03-19}}</ref><ref name="parsons">{{Citation | last= Harris | first = John |title='Dark Side' at 30: Alan Parsons |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/articles/story/5937469/dark_side_at_30_alan_parsons | publisher = rollingstone.com |date=2003-03-12 |accessdate=2009-02-18 }}</ref>

Returning from the US in January 1973, they recorded "Brain Damage", "Eclipse", "[[Any Colour You Like]]" and "On the Run", simultaneously fine-tuning the work they had already done in the previous sessions.  A foursome of female vocalists was assembled to sing on "Brain Damage", "Eclipse" and "Time", and saxophonist [[Dick Parry]] was booked to play on "Us and Them" and "Money".  With director [[Adrian Maben]] the band also filmed studio footage for ''[[Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=158.}}</ref>  Once the recording sessions were complete, the band began a tour of Europe.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=109&ndash;114.}}</ref>

===Instrumentation===
The album is particularly notable for the metronomic sound effects during "Speak to Me", and the tape loops that open "Money".  Nick Mason, responsible for most of the sound effects used on Pink Floyd's discography, received a rare solo composing credit for "Speak to Me".<ref name="Schaffnerp164"/>  The track serves as an introduction, with cross-fades of elements from other pieces on the album.  Mason created a rough version at his home, before completing it in the studio.  A piano chord, replayed backwards, serves to augment the build-up of effects, which are immediately followed by the opening of "Breathe".<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=172.}}</ref>  The sound effects on "Money" were created by splicing together Waters' recordings of clinking coins, tearing paper, a ringing cash register and a clicking adding machine to create a [[beat (music)|7-beat]] [[tape loop|effects loop]] (later adapted to four tracks in order to create a "walk around the room" effect in quadraphonic presentations of the album).<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=104&ndash;105.}}</ref>  At times the sonic experimentation on the album required the engineers and all band members to operate the mixing console's faders simultaneously to mix down the intricately assembled [[multitrack recording]]s of several of the songs (particularly "On the Run").<ref name="makingof"/>

Along with the conventional [[rock music|rock]] band instrumentation, Pink Floyd added prominent [[synthesizers]] to their sound.  For example, the band experimented with an [[EMS VCS 3]] on "Brain Damage" and "Any Colour You Like", and a [[EMS Synthi A|Synthi A]] on "Time" and "On the Run".<!-- VCS 3 and Synthi A are technically the same, only using different housings! -->  They also devised and recorded unconventional sounds: an assistant engineer running around the studio's echo chamber (during "On the Run"),<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=118&ndash;120.}}</ref> and a specially treated [[bass drum]] made to simulate a human [[heart rate|heartbeat]] (during "Speak to Me", "On the Run", "Time", and "Eclipse").  This sound is most prominent as the intro and the outro to the album, but it can also be heard sporadically on other tracks<U+2014>the songs "Time" and "On the Run" have the low thudding.<ref name="makingof"/>  The assorted clocks ticking then chiming simultaneously (during "Time") were initially created as a [[Quadraphonic sound|quadraphonic]] test by Parsons.<ref name="Schaffnerp164">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=164.}}</ref>  Parsons recorded each timepiece at an antique clock shop, and although the material had not been created specifically for the album, elements of it were eventually used in the track, accompanied by a series of [[Rototom]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=173.}}</ref>

===Voices===
Several tracks, including "Us and Them" and "Time", are notable for demonstrating Richard Wright and David Gilmour's ability to harmonise their voices.  In ''[[Classic Albums: Pink Floyd - The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon|The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', a 2003 DVD documentary on the production of the album, Roger Waters attributes this to the fact that their voices both sound extremely similar.  To take advantage of this, Parsons perfected the use of other studio techniques such as the [[doubletracking]] of vocals and guitars, and other vocal multitracking which allowed Gilmour to harmonise with himself. He also made prominent use of [[flanging]] and phase shifting effects on vocals and instruments, odd trickery with [[reverberation|reverb]],<ref name="makingof"/> and the panning of sounds between channels (most notable in the [[quadraphonic]] mix of "On the Run", when the sound of the [[Hammond B3]] organ played through a [[Leslie speaker]] rapidly swirls around the listener).<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2005|p=161.}}</ref>

The album's credits include [[Clare Torry]], a session singer and songwriter, and a regular at Abbey Road.  She had worked on pop material and numerous cover albums, and after hearing one of those albums Parsons invited her to the studio to sing on "The Great Gig in the Sky".  She declined this invitation as she wanted to watch [[Chuck Berry]] perform at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]], but arranged to come in on the following Sunday.  The band explained the concept behind the album, but were unable to tell her exactly what she should do.

Snippets of voices between and over the music are a feature of the album.  During recording sessions, Roger Waters recruited both the staff and the temporary occupants of the studio to answer a series of questions printed on [[flashcards]].  The interviewees were placed in front of a microphone in a darkened studio&nbsp;three,<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=175.}}</ref> and shown such questions as "What's your favourite colour?" and "What's your favourite food?", before moving on to themes more central to the album (such as madness, violence, and death).  Questions were answered in the order they were presented, provoking surprising responses. The question "When was the last time you were violent?" was immediately followed by "Were you in the right?"<ref name="makingof"/>  The recording of road manager Roger "The Hat" Manifold was the only one obtained through a conventional sit-down interview as initially the band could not find him, and by then the flashcards had been mislaid.  When asked about a violent encounter he'd had with another motorist, Manifold's replied "...&nbsp;give 'em a quick, short, sharp shock&nbsp;...", and when asked about death he responded "live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me&nbsp;..."<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=165.}}</ref>  Another roadie, Chris Adamson, was on tour with Pink Floyd at the time and recorded his explicit diatribe that opens the album: "I've been mad for fucking years<U+2014>absolutely years".<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|p=133.}}</ref>  Pink Floyd's road manager Peter Watts (father of actress [[Naomi Watts]])<ref>{{Citation | title = How Naomi told her mum about Oscar | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/02/22/1077384633676.html | last = Sams | first = Christine | publisher = smh.com.au | date = 2004-02-23 | accessdate = 2009-03-17}}</ref> contributed the repeated laughter during "Brain Damage" and "Speak to Me".

===Completion===
Following the completion of the dialogue sessions, producer [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]] was hired to provide "a fresh pair of ears".  Thomas' background was musical rather than engineering.  He had worked with Beatles manager [[George Martin]], and was acquainted with Pink Floyd's manager [[Steve O'Rourke]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=177.}}</ref>  All four members of the band were engaged in a disagreement over the style of the mix.  Waters and Mason preferred a "dry" and "clean" mix, making more use of the non-musical elements, but Gilmour and Wright preferred a subtler and more "echoey" mix.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=178.}}</ref>  Thomas later claimed there were no such disagreements, stating "There was no difference in opinion between them, I don't remember Roger once saying that he wanted less echo.  In fact, there were never any hints that they were later going to fall out.  It was a very creative atmosphere.  A lot of fun."<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|p=135.}}</ref>  Although the truth remains unclear, Thomas' intervention resulted in a welcome compromise between Waters and Gilmour, leaving both entirely satisfied with the end product.  Thomas was responsible for significant changes to the album, including the perfect timing of the echo used on "Us and Them".  He was also present for the recording of "The Great Gig in the Sky" (although Parsons was responsible for hiring Torry).<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=134&ndash;140.}}</ref>  Interviewed in 2006, when asked if he felt his goals had been accomplished in the studio, Roger Waters said:

{{Quote|When the record was finished I took a reel-to-reel copy home with me and I remember playing it for my wife then, and I remember her bursting into tears when it was finished. And I thought, "This has obviously struck a chord somewhere", and I was kinda pleased by that.  You know when you've done something, certainly if you create a piece of music, you then hear it with fresh ears when you play it for somebody else. And at that point I thought to myself, "Wow, this is a pretty complete piece of work", and I had every confidence that people would respond to it.|Roger Waters|<ref name="Billboard"/>}}

{{Quote|It felt like the whole band were working together.  It was a creative time.  We were all very open.|Richard Wright|<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|p=3.}}</ref>}}

==Packaging==
The album was originally released in a gatefold LP sleeve designed by [[Hipgnosis]] and [[George Hardie (artist)|George Hardie]], and bore Hardie's iconic refracting prism on the cover.  Hipgnosis had designed several of the band's previous albums, with controversial results; EMI had reacted with confusion when faced with the cover designs for ''[[Atom Heart Mother]]'' and ''[[Obscured by Clouds]]'', as they had expected to see traditional designs which included lettering and words.  Designers [[Storm Thorgeson]] and [[Aubrey Powell (designer)|Aubrey Powell]] were able to ignore such criticism as they were employed by the band.  For ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' Richard Wright instructed them to come up with something "smarter, neater<U+2014>more classy".<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|p=143.}}</ref>  The prism design was inspired by a photograph that Thorgeson had seen in a brainstorming session with Powell.  The artwork was created by Hipgnosis employee George Hardie.  Hipgnosis offered the band a choice of seven designs, but all four members agreed that the prism was by far the best.  The prism design represents three elements; the band's stage lighting, the album lyrics, and Richard Wright's request for a "simple and bold" design.<ref name="makingof"/>  The spectrum of light continues through to the gatefold before being recombined on the back&mdash;an idea that Roger Waters came up with.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=165&ndash;166.}}</ref>  Added shortly afterwards, the gatefold design also includes a visual representation of the heartbeat used throughout the album, and the back of the album cover contains Thorgeson's suggestion of another prism recombining the spectrum of light, facilitating interesting layouts of the sleeve in record shops.<ref name="Harrispp141147">{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=141&ndash;147.}}</ref> The light band emanating from the prism on the album cover is actually missing one colour, Indigo. A normal [[Prism (optics)|prism]] would display a band of Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet. 

Inside the sleeve were two posters, one bearing pictures of the band in concert with the words PINK FLOYD broken up and scattered about, and the other an image of the [[Giza pyramid complex|Great Pyramids of Giza]] taken on [[Infrared photography|infrared film]] by Powell and Thorgeson.<ref name="Harrispp141147"/>  Also included was a sheet of stickers of the pyramids.  In 2003 [[VH1]] named the album's cover the 4th-greatest album cover of all time,<ref name="Vh1">{{Citation | title = The Greatest: 50 Greatest Album Covers | url = http://www.vh1.com/photos/gallery/?fid=1478677&pid=1542318 | publisher = vh1.com | accessdate = 2009-03-17}}</ref> and in 2009 listeners of the UK radio station Planet Rock voted it the greatest album cover of all time.<ref>{{Citation | title = Top Rock Album | url = http://www.planetrock.com/top-rock-album.htm | publisher = planetrock.com | accessdate = 2009-04-14}}</ref>

Since the departure of founding member Barrett in 1968, the burden of lyrical composition had fallen mostly on Waters' shoulders.<ref name="Masonp167">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=167.}}</ref>  He is therefore credited as the author of the album's lyrics, making ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' the first of five consecutive Pink Floyd albums with lyrics credited only to him.<ref name="sleeve notes">{{Citation | title = Pink Floyd&nbsp;<U+2014>Dark Side of the Moon&nbsp;<U+2014>sleeve notes | publisher = TRO Hampshire House Publishing Corp. | year = 1973}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The sleeve notes for ''Wish You Were Here'', ''Animals'', and ''The Wall'' credit Roger Waters as sole lyricist.

{{Quote|That's crap. There's no question that Dave needs a vehicle to bring out the best of his guitar playing.  And he is a great guitar player.  But the idea which he's tried to propagate over the years that he's somehow more musical than I am is absolute fucking nonsense.

With the exception of Wright, the band boycotted the press reception at the [[London Planetarium]] on 27&nbsp;February,<ref name="Poveyp175"/> as the quadraphonic mix was not yet complete.

===Label===
Much of the album's early stateside success has been attributed to the efforts of Pink Floyd's US record company, [[Capitol Records]].  Newly appointed chairman [[Bhaskar Menon]] set about trying to reverse the relatively poor sales of the band's previous studio album, ''Meddle''.  Meanwhile, disenchanted with Capitol the band and manager O'Rourke had been quietly negotiating a new contract with [[Columbia Records]], with [[CBS]] president [[Clive Davis]].  ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' was the last album that Pink Floyd were obliged to release before formally signing a new contract.  Menon's enthusiasm for the new album was such that he was responsible for a huge promotional advertising campaign, which included radio-friendly truncated versions of "Us and Them" and "Time".<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=158&ndash;161}}</ref>  In some countries&mdash;notably the UK&mdash;Pink Floyd had not released a single since 1968's "[[Point Me at the Sky]], and unusually "Money" was released as a single on 7 May,<ref name="Poveyp175">{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=175.}}</ref> with "[[Any Colour You Like]]" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]].

Some surprise was expressed when the band elected not to use the older quadraphonic mix from Parsons (mixed shortly after the original release), and instead chose to have their current engineer [[James Guthrie (record producer)|James Guthrie]] create a new [[5.1]]&nbsp;channel surround sound mix on the SACD format.<ref name="anotherphase"/><ref>{{Citation | title = Tales from the Dark Side | url = http://www.soundandvisionmag.com/features/445/tales-from-the-dark-side.html | last = Richardson | first = Ken | publisher = soundandvisionmag.com | date = 2003-06 | accessdate = 2009-03-19}}</ref>  Guthrie has worked with the band since co-producing and engineering their 1979 release, ''[[The Wall]]'', and had previously worked on surround versions of ''The Wall'' for DVD-video, and Waters's ''In the Flesh'' for SACD.  Speaking in 2003, Alan Parsons expressed some disappointment with Guthrie's SACD mix:

{{Quote|I'm generally rather disappointed. It's not very discrete.  There is some discrete information in there.  But I found myself, about two-thirds of the way through, kind of forgetting that this was surround.  James was possibly a little too true to the original mix.  He could have taken some risks, as I did on the quad.  One of the parameters I always work with when I'm mixing for surround is: Keep the Interest.  If there's nothing going on, then stick something in the back.|Alan Parsons|<ref name="anotherphase"/>}}
<!-- need more about guthrie's mix here to avoid [[wp:npov]] -->

Speaking of the surround sound mix for "On the Run", Parsons said: "After hearing his mix for a while, I think I'm hearing stereo with a bit of surround."  He praised the mix for other songs, particularly "The Great Gig in the Sky": "I tip my hat to James for sorting out the correct bits of Clare's vocals. And he has improved on the stereo mix, which is a bit wishy-washy. The stereo is heavy on the Hammond organ, and Clare's a little too far down. In my quad mix, the Hammond is barely there, which shows you I really wasn't being faithful to the stereo mix. The quad sounds pretty good, but James still has the edge. His mix is definitely cleaner, and he's brought Clare out a bit more."<ref name="anotherphasep2">{{Citation | title = Another Phase of the Moon page 2 | url = http://www.soundandvisionmag.com/features/444/another-phase-of-the-moon-page2.html | last = Richardson | first = Ken | publisher = soundandvisionmag.com | date = 2003-05 | accessdate = 2009-03-19}}</ref>  This 30th-anniversary edition won four Surround Music Awards in 2003,<ref>{{Citation | title = Surround Music Awards 2003 | url = http://www.surroundpro.com/2003/surround2003/sma.shtml | publisher = surroundpro.com | date = 2003-12-11 | accessdate = 2009-03-19}}</ref> and has since sold more than 800,000&nbsp;copies.<ref name="iTunes"/>  The cover design was created by a team of designers which again included Storm Thorgerson.

''The Dark Side of the Moon'' was also re-released in 2003 on 180-gram virgin vinyl (mastered by Kevin Gray at AcousTech Mastering) and included slightly different versions of the original posters and stickers that came with the original vinyl release, along with a new 30th anniversary poster.<ref>{{Citation | title = Pink Floyd&nbsp;<U+2014>Dark Side of the Moon&nbsp;<U+2014>180 Gram Vinyl LP | url = http://store.acousticsounds.com/browse_detail.cfm?Title_ID=11084 | publisher = store.acousticsounds.com | accessdate = 2009-03-29}}</ref>  In 2007 the album was included in ''[[Oh, by the Way]]'', a box set celebrating the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd,<ref>{{Citation | last = Kreps | first = Daniel | title = "Oh By The Way": Pink Floyd Celebrate Belated 40th Anniversary With Mega Box Set | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/10/25/oh-by-the-way-pink-floyd-celebrate-belated-40th-anniversary-with-mega-box-set/ | publisher = rollinstone.com | date = 2007-10-25 | accessdate = 2009-08-22}}</ref> and a [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-free version was released on [[iTunes]].<ref name="iTunes">{{Citation | last = Musil | first = Steven | title = 'Dark Side of the Moon' shines on iTunes | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9738439-7.html | publisher = news.cnet.com | date = 2007-07-01 | accessdate = 2009-08-12}}</ref>

==Legacy==
The success of the album brought previously unknown wealth to all four members of the band; Richard Wright and Roger Waters bought large country houses, and Nick Mason became a collector of upmarket cars.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=164&ndash;166.}}</ref>  Some of the profits were invested in the production of ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Parker|O'Shea|2006|pp=50&ndash;51.}}</ref>  Engineer Alan Parsons would go on to have a successful career of his own, although Roger Waters and David Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the success of the album.  Nick Mason however has praised his role.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=173&ndash;174.}}</ref>  Parsons received a [[Grammy Award]] for "best engineered album" in 1973,<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=163.}}</ref> and reflecting on its success, in a recent interview for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' he said "I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on Dark Side of the Moon, which has an element of truth to it. But I still wake up occasionally, frustrated about the fact that they made untold millions and a lot of the people involved in the record didn't."<ref name="parsons"/>

The enduring legacy of ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' is however in its influence on modern music, the musicians who have performed cover versions of its songs, and even in modern urban myths.  It is often seen as a symbolic point in the history of rock music, and a common comparison is one made between Pink Floyd and [[Radiohead]], specifically their 1997 album ''[[OK Computer]]''.  Although [[Robert Christgau]] commented that Radiohead's offering lacked "soul", calling it "arid" and "ridiculous" and comparing it unfavourably to Pink Floyd,<ref>{{citation | url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv997-97.php | title=Consumer Guide Sept. 1997 | last=Christgau | first=Robert | author-link = Robert Christgau | publisher = robertchristgau.com | magazine=[[Village Voice]] | date = 1997-09-23 | accessdate = 2008-09-29}}</ref> the two albums share a common theme: the loss of a creative individual's ability to function in the modern world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|pp=208<U+2013>211.}}</ref>  [[Mungolian Jetset]]'s [[Knut S<U+00E6>vik]] has mentioned drawing inspiration from ''The Dark Side of the Moon'', in their recent work ''We Gave it All Away&nbsp;...&nbsp;Now We Are Taking It Back''.<ref>{{Citation | last = Tantum | first = Bruce | title = Flights of Fancy | url = http://newyork.timeout.com/articles/clubs/77626/flights-of-fancy | publisher = newyork.timeout.com | date = 2009-08-26 | accessdate = 2009-08-23}}</ref>  On 8 February 1995 the opening sequence of "Time" was played as a wakeup call for the crew of space mission [[STS-63]].<ref>{{Citation | title = Chronology of Wakeup Calls | url = http://history.nasa.gov/wakeup%20calls.pdf | format = PDF | last = Fries | first = Colin | publisher = NASA History Division | page = 27 | accessdate = 2009-03-16}}</ref>

A range of performers have used samples of ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' in their own material.  [[Milli Vanilli]] used the tape loops from Pink Floyd's "Money" to open their eponymously named track "[[All or Nothing (Milli Vanilli album)|Money]]", followed by [[Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch]] on ''[[Music for the People (Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch album)|Music for the People]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|pp=189<U+2013>190.}}</ref>  The album has been [[Cover version|covered]] by several acts, both live and recorded.

===Covers===
One of the more notable covers of ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' is ''Return to the Dark Side of the Moon: A Tribute to Pink Floyd''.  Released in 2006, the album is a progressive rock tribute featuring artists such as [[Adrian Belew]], [[Tommy Shaw]], [[Dweezil Zappa]], and [[Rick Wakeman]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Prato | first = Greg | title = Return to the Dark Side of the Moon: A Tribute to Pink Floyd | url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:apfixqudld0e | publisher = allmusic.com | accessdate = 2009-08-22}}</ref>  In 2000 [[The Squirrels]] released ''The Not So Bright Side of the Moon'', which features a cover of the entire album.<ref>{{Citation | title = The Not So Bright Side of the Moon | url = http://www.thesquirrels.com/poplust/newcd.htm | publisher = thesquirrels.com | accessdate = 2009-03-27}}</ref>  The New York dub collective [[Easy Star All Stars]] in 2003 released ''[[Dub Side of the Moon]]''.<ref>{{Citation | title = Dub Side of the Moon | url = http://www.easystar.com/releases/show/2 | publisher = easystar.com | accessdate = 2009-03-27}}</ref>  ''From the Dark Side of the Moon'' is a song-by-song "re-imagining" of the album by former [[October Project]] vocalist [[Mary Fahl]], but because of the [[V2 Records]] label's reorganisation, the recording has not been officially released.

===''Dark Side of the Rainbow''===
The ''[[Dark Side of the Rainbow]]'', or ''The Dark Side of Oz'', is the title of a rumour circulated on the Internet since at least 1994<U+2014>that the ''Dark Side of the Moon'' was written as a soundtrack to the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Observers playing the film and the album simultaneously have reported apparent synchronicities, such as [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] beginning to jog as the band sings "no one told you when to run".<ref>{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|p=57.}}</ref>  David Gilmour and Nick Mason have both denied a connection between the two works, and Roger Waters has described the rumours as "amusing".<ref>{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|p=59.}}</ref> Alan Parsons has stated that the film was not mentioned during production of the album.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|p=70.}}</ref>
