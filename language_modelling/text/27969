'''Spite Your Face Productions''', or SYF, is an [[animation]] production company based in [[London]], England, consisting of animation directors Tony Mines and Tim Drage. They have created a variety of animated content for broadcast, web and DVD, but are best known for their series of [[stop-motion]] animated [[LEGO]] shorts.

Since 2001, SYF have worked on five animated projects for the LEGO company and their respective clients, including [[SONY]], [[Marvel Entertainment]], [[Lucasfilm]] and [[Python Pictures]]. They have also produced LEGO animations independently. SYF refer to these works as 'Bricksploitation films' to distinguish them from those of the fan community. Some of their films have been distributed internationally on DVD,<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0353751/ Monty Python & the Holy Grail in Lego (2001)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but all have enjoyed great success online, and are amongst the earliest [[viral video]] hits.

== Trivia ==
{{Trivia|date=June 2008}}
At time of release, ''Spider-Man: The Peril of Doc Ock''  held the top spot on iFilm, Atomfilm and Yahoo Movies simultaneously. Only SYF's own ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail in Lego'' nudging it in second place.

''Star Wars: The Han Solo Affair''  was the first short film to be made under the Star Wars license since 1978, when a [[Boba Fett]] animated short was featured in [[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]. It was also the first licensed stand-alone Star Wars animation since the [[Nelvana]] Ewoks and Droids animations ended in 1987.

SYF only produced the animated segments for the 2002 [[LEGO Studios]] range. They were not involved in the 2000 edition animations, ''Jewel Quest'' and ''Jurassic Bark'', as is often cited.<ref>[[Brickfilm]]</ref>

They were also not involved in the [[White Stripes]]' "[[Fell in Love with a Girl]]" video, as has been cited.<ref>[http://www.mvdbase.com/video.php?id=29702 mvdbase.com - the White Stripes - "Fell in love with a girl"<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

SYF Director Tony Mines has also directed television commercials, notably for Kellogg's [[Coco Pops]].<ref>http://chillibean.net/perl/reels-9.6.pl?xhtml=CGZT653W&T=WL</ref>
