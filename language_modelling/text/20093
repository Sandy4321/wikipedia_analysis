A typical arrangement for a compound engine is that the steam is first expanded in a high-pressure ''(HP)'' [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], then having given up heat and losing pressure, it exhausts directly into one or more larger volume low-pressure ''(LP)'' cylinders. Multiple-expansion engines employ additional cylinders, of progressively lower pressure, to extract further energy from the steam.<ref>{{harvnb|Hills|1989|p=147}}</ref>

Invented in 1781, this technique was first employed on a Cornish [[beam engine]] in 1804. Around 1850, compound engines were first introduced into Lancashire textile mills<!-- , and the pressure of the steam increased, and the principle was applied to horizontal rotative engines, which became the standard engine in later mills -->.

==Compound systems==
There are many compound systems and configurations, but there are two basic types, according to how HP and LP piston strokes are phased and hence whether the HP exhaust is able to pass directly from HP to LP ([[Arthur Woolf|Woolf compounds]]) or whether pressure fluctuation necessitates an intermediate "buffer" space in the form of a steam chest or pipe known as a ''receiver'' ([[McNaught engine|receiver compounds]]).<ref name="Raiput">{{Citation

In a single-expansion (or 'simple') steam engine, the high-pressure steam enters the cylinder through a [[Cutoff (steam engine)|cut-off]] valve (archaically known as a regulator). The [[piston]] moves down the cylinder, and when it is at about 25%<U+2013>33% of its stroke, the cut-off valve shuts and the steam expands, pushing the piston to the end of its stroke, the exhaust valve opens and expels the depleted steam to the atmosphere, or to a condenser.  <!-- not in compound  --> <!-- Yes in compound - the final exhaust may be to a condenser -->As steam expands in a high-pressure engine, its temperature drops; because no heat is released from the system, this is known as [[adiabatic process|adiabatic expansion]] and results in steam entering the cylinder at high temperature and leaving at low temperature. This causes a cycle of heating and cooling of the cylinder with every stroke which is a source of inefficiency. The steam cut-off point when using a [[slide valve]] is less than 30% of the stroke. <!-- Early cut off accentuates the effects of the clearance problem   haven t understood what this is-->Early cut-off causes the [[moment (physics)|turning moment]]<!--perhaps 'turning moment' should be a redirect, if this link is correct--> on the shaft to be more uneven, requiring a larger [[flywheel]] to smooth this out.<ref name=Raiput/>

===Compounding engines===
A method to lessen the magnitude of this heating and cooling was invented in 1804 by British engineer [[Arthur Woolf]], who patented his ''Woolf high pressure compound engine'' in 1805. In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler first expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower pressure (LP) cylinders. The complete expansion of the steam occurs across multiple cylinders and, as there is less expansion in each cylinder, less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine.

There are other advantages: as the temperature range is smaller, cylinder condensation is reduced. Loss due to condensation is restricted to the LP cylinder. Pressure difference is less in each cylinder so there is less steam leakage at the piston and valves. The turning moment is more uniform, so balancing is easier and a smaller flywheel may be used. Only the smaller HP cylinder needs to be built to withstand the highest pressure, so reducing the overall weight. Similarly, components are subject to less strain so can be lighter. The  reciprocating parts of the engine are lighter reducing the engine vibrations.
The compound could be started at any point in the cycle, and in the event of mechanical failure the compound could be reset to act as a simple, and thus keep running.<ref name=Raiput/>

To derive equal work from lower pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume. Therefore the bore, and often the stroke, are increased in low-pressure cylinders resulting in larger cylinders.

Double-expansion (usually just known as 'compound') engines expand the steam in two stages. The pairs may be duplicated{{Clarify|reason=what pairs?|date=June 2010}} or the work of the large LP cylinder can be split across two smaller cylinders, with one HP cylinder exhausting into either LP cylinder, giving a 3-cylinder layout where the cylinder and piston diameter of all three are about the same making the reciprocating masses easier to balance.

Two-cylinder compounds can be arranged as:
* '''Cross-compound''' <U+2013> the cylinders are side-by-side.
* '''Tandem compound''' <U+2013> the cylinders are end-to-end, driving a common connecting rod
* '''Angle-compound''' <U+2013> the cylinders are arranged in a vee (usually at a 90<U+00B0> angle) and drive a common crank.{{cref|Cylinder phasing}}<!--Not sure what name is best for this note link, nor where best to put it-->

The adoption of compounding was widespread for stationary industrial units where the need was for increased power at decreasing cost, and almost universal for [[marine steam engine|marine engines]] after 1880. It was not widely used in railway locomotives where it was often perceived as complicated and unsuitable for the harsh railway operating environment and limited space afforded by the [[loading gauge]] (particularly in Britain). Compounding was never common on British railways<!--small 'r'!--> and not employed at all after 1930, but was used in a limited way in many other countries.<ref name="van Riemsdijk, Compound Locomotives" >{{Citation

However, the first successful attempt to fly a heavier-than-air fixed-wing aircraft solely on steam power occurred in 1933, when [[Doble steam car#Besler Brothers|George and William Besler]] converted a [[Travel Air 2000]] biplane to fly on a 150 hp angle-compound V-twin steam engine of their own design instead of the usual [[Curtiss OX-5]] inline or radial aviation gasoline engine it would have normally used.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=AygDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA9&dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Science%22&hl=en&ei=QeBUTc_hNsH-8AaqrZyPBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Popular%20Science%201933%20plane%20%22Popular%20Science%22&f=true "World's First Steam Driven Airplane"] ''Popular Science'', July 1933, detailed article with drawings</ref><ref>{{Cite video

===Multiple expansion engines {{anchor|Multiple expansion engines|Triple-expansion steam engine}}===
[[Image:Triple expansion engine animation.gif|thumb|An animation of a double-acting inverted triple-expansion marine engine.<br />High-pressure steam (red) enters from the boiler and passes through the engine, exhausting as low-pressure steam (blue) to the condenser.]]

It is a logical extension of the compound engine (described above) to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency. The result is the '''multiple-expansion engine'''. Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as ''triple-'' and ''quadruple-expansion engines'' respectively. These engines use a series of double-acting cylinders of progressively increasing diameter and/or stroke and hence volume. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into three or four equal portions, one for each expansion stage. The image to the right shows an animation of a triple-expansion engine. The steam travels through the engine from left to right. The valve chest for each of the cylinders is to the left of the corresponding cylinder.

== History ==
===Early work===
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
*1781 <U+2013> [[Jonathan Hornblower]], the grandson of one of [[Thomas Newcomen|Newcomen]]'s engine erectors in Cornwall, patented a double-cylinder compound reciprocating [[beam engine]] in 1781. He was prevented from developing it further by [[James Watt]], who claimed his own patents were infringed.<ref>Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online, retrieved 29 March 2007.</ref>

*1804 <U+2013> A method to lessen the magnitude of the continual heating and cooling of a single-expansion steam engine that leads to inefficiency was invented by British engineer [[Arthur Woolf]]. Woolf patented his stationary ''Woolf high-pressure compound engine'' in 1805.

===Double-expansion===
*1845 <U+2013> [[William McNaught (Glasgow)]] devised a method of fixing an additional high-pressure cylinder within an existing beam engine. To do so involved using a long pipe to connect the cylinders, and an extra set of valves to balance them. In effect this acted as a receiving chest, and a new type of compound had been invented. This system allowed greater control of the steam intake and cut-offs. An engine could be slowed by either a throttle which reduced the pressure of the steam, or by adjusting the cut-off on either cylinder. The latter was more efficient as no power was lost. The cycle was smoother as the two cylinders were not in phase.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hills|1989|p=157}}</ref>

*1865 [[SS Agamemnon (1865)]] was launched, equipped with a 300[[hp]] compound steam engine. The engine was designed by Alfred Holt, one her owners. The efficiency obtained enabled this ship to sail 8,500 miles before coaling. This made her competitive on routes between China and Britain.<ref name="Clark"><{{cite book |last=Clark|first=Arthur H. |date= 1911|title=The Clipper Ship Era 1843-1869 |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924020891416#page/n5/mode/2up |location=New York |publisher=G.P.

Though the first mills were driven by [[water power]], once steam engines were adopted the manufacturer no longer needed to site the mills by running water. Cotton spinning required ever larger mills to fulfil the demand, and this drove the owners to demand increasingly powerful engines. When boiler pressure had exceeded 60psi, compound engines achieved a thermo-dynamic advantage, but it was the mechanical advantages of the smoother stroke that was the deciding factor in the adoption of compounds. In 1859, there was 75,886&nbsp;ihp (indicated horsepower{{cref|ihp}}) of engines in mills in the Manchester area, of which 32,282 ihp was provided by compounds though only 41,189 ihp was generated from boilers operated at over 60psi.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hills|1989|p=160}}</ref>

To generalise, between 1860 and 1926 all Lancashire mills were driven by compounds. The last compound built was by [[Buckley & Taylor|Buckley and Taylor]] for [[List of mills in Shaw and Crompton#V to Z|Wye No.2 mill, Shaw]]. This engine was a cross-compound design to 2,500 ihp, driving a 24&nbsp;ft, 90 ton flywheel, and operated until 1965.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hills|1989|p=281}}</ref>

In the marine environment, the general requirement was for autonomy and increased operating range, as ships had to carry their coal<!--and water?--> supplies. The old salt-water boiler was thus no longer adequate and had to be replaced by a closed fresh-water circuit with condenser. The result from 1880 onwards was the '''multiple-expansion engine''' using three or four expansion stages (''triple-'' and ''quadruple-expansion engines''). These engines used a series of double-acting cylinders of progressively increasing diameter and/or stroke (and hence volume) designed to divide the work into three or four, as appropriate, equal portions for each expansion stage. Where space is at a premium, two smaller cylinders of a large sum volume might be used for the low-pressure stage. Multiple-expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged in-line, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing 'system' was used on some marine triple-expansion engines. Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration. This made the 4-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the [[Olympic class ocean liner|Olympic class]]), but was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration-free [[steam turbine]].

The development of this type of engine was important for its use in steamships as by exhausting to a condenser the water could be reclaimed to feed the boiler, which was unable to use [[seawater]]. Land-based steam engines could simply exhaust much of their steam, as feed water was usually readily available. Prior to and during [[World War II]], the expansion engine dominated marine applications where high vessel speed was not essential. It was however superseded by the steam turbine when speed was required, for instance in warships and [[ocean liner]]s. [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']] of 1905 was the first major warship to replace the proven technology of the reciprocating engine with the then-novel steam turbine.

===Application to railway locomotives===
{{Main|Compound locomotive}}
For railway locomotive applications the main benefit sought from compounding was economy in fuel and water consumption plus high power/weight ratio due to temperature and pressure drop taking place over a longer cycle, this resulting in increased efficiency; additional perceived advantages included more even torque.

While designs for compound locomotives may date as far back as [[James Samuel]]'s 1856 patent for a "continuous expansion locomotive",<ref>{{Citation

}}</ref> the practical history of railway compounding begins with [[Anatole Mallet]]'s designs in the 1870s. [[Mallet locomotive]]s were operated in the United States up to the end of mainline steam by the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]]. The designs of [[Alfred George de Glehn]] in France also saw significant use, especially in the rebuilds of [[Andr<U+00E9> Chapelon]]. A wide variety of compound designs were tried around 1900, but most were short-lived in popularity, due to their complexity and maintenance liability. In the 20th century the [[superheater]] was widely adopted, and the vast majority of steam locomotives were simple-expansion (with some compound locomotives converted to simple).

==Notes==
{{cnote|Cylinder phasing|
With two-cylinder compounds used in railway work, the pistons are connected to the cranks as with a two-cylinder simple at 90<U+00B0> out-of-phase with each other (''quartered'').

When the double-expansion group is duplicated, producing a 4-cylinder compound, the individual pistons within the group are usually balanced at 180<U+00B0>, the groups being set at 90<U+00B0> to each other. In one case (the first type of [[Vauclain compound]]), the pistons worked in the same phase driving a common crosshead and crank, again set at 90<U+00B0> as for a two-cylinder engine.

With the 3-cylinder compound arrangement, the LP cranks were either set at 90<U+00B0> with the HP one at 135<U+00B0> to the other two, or in some cases all three cranks were set at 120<U+00B0>.}}

{{cnote|ihp|
The power of a mill engine was originally measured in [[Horsepower#Nominal horsepower|Nominal Horse Power]], but this system understated the power of a compound [[William McNaught (Glasgow)]] system suitable for compounds, ihp or indicated horse power. As a rule of thumb ihp is 2.6 times nhp, in a compound engine.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hills|1989|p=145}}</ref>}}
