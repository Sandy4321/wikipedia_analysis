'''''Cut the Crap''''' was [[The Clash]]'s final album. It was originally released in 1985 as the follow-up to ''[[Combat Rock]]'' (1982), and was the first Clash record since [[Topper Headon]] was dismissed from the group in 1982 and [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]]' departure from the group in 1983.

According to guitarist [[Vince White]] the working title of the record was '''''Out Of Control''''', the title was changed to ''Cut The Crap'' by [[Bernie Rhodes]] shortly before its release without consulting the band. [[Bernie Rhodes]] also produced the record, using the alias of ''Jose Unidos'' (presumably to suggest [[Joe Strummer]] was the producer).

Critical and commercial reception to the record was poor aside from the single "[[This Is England (song)|This Is England]]." Jones's absence coupled with drummer [[Topper Headon]] having been kicked out (unable to cope with his on-going [[heroin]] addiction) led many to regard ''Cut the Crap'' as a [[Joe Strummer]] solo album. Indeed, the album was apparently set against Jones' ''[[This is Big Audio Dynamite]]'' (1985) as just that.<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/thewhiteriot/review20.html]</ref>  The poor quality of the record was blamed mostly on the shortcomings of the new members, though in actuality neither the new members nor [[Paul Simonon]] even got to play on the record{{Fact|date=September 2007}}. One of the main reasons for the albums' shortcomings was Joe Strummer becoming disillusioned with the group and also grieving the deaths of his parents. Another was manager [[Bernie Rhodes]]' insistence on being more involved in the making of the band's records, producing the album and crediting himself as a co-writer much to the bands' annoyance.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  Strummer would later disown the album. In an interview in 1989 he commented about the new members "I often think of those guys. I hope it didn't mess up their lives too much".  Accordingly, the album has been disowned by purists of Clash history, including the former band; it was not even mentioned in the Clash [[documentary film|documentary]] ''[[Westway to the World]]''.

"This Is England" was the only song from ''Cut the Crap'' included on the ''[[The Essential Clash]]'' and ''[[Singles Box]]'' compilations.  No track from the album was included on the three disc Clash box set ''[[Clash on Broadway]]''.

In January 2000 this album, along with the rest of the Clash's catalog, was remastered and re-released with a bonus track "Do It Now".

"This Is England" was featured on the Singles Box Set (released in 2006) along with the single's b-sides "Do It Now" and "Sex Mad Roar".

A bootleg is currently available which essentially captures some of "The Clash II" (as the new line-up is sometimes described) performances of the songs on ''Cut the Crap''.
