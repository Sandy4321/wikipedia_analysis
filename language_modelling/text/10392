'''RAF Wickenby''' was a purpose built bomber base constructed late 1942 and early 1943. It lies halfway between Wickenby and [[Holton cum Beckering]], to the south-east of [[Wickenby]] close to the B1399 in [[West Lindsey]], {{Convert|8|NM|abbr=on|lk=in}} north-east of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]].<ref name="aip"/>

==Construction==
It had two T2 type hangars and one B1 type. The B1 and one of the T2 hangars can still be seen on the airfield site. The T2 near the threshold of runway 21 was recently acquired by the airfield owners and after many years of industrial use in now, once more, an [[Hangar|aircraft hangar]].

The airfield covered about {{convert|600|acre|km2}}, and had the usual three runway configuration with peripheral tracks, hard standings, a brick watchtower and numerous brick and metal buildings for the aircrews and ground staff. A number of the buildings were to the east (Communal Site, Living Quarters, [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force|WAAF]] Quarters) and stretched to and beyond the Lissington road - a road travelled many an evening by the airmen and women who visited their favourite watering hole, the ''White Hart''<ref>[http://www.12sqn.net/wickenby/pub.html White Hart]</ref> at [[Lissington]]. The Sick Quarters were to the south of the airfield together with a Communal Site and Living Quarters.

Wickenby was occupied in September 1942 by [[No. 12 Squadron RAF|No. 12 Squadron]] (a/c code PH) who brought with them [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington]] II/III's, but during the winter of 1942/3 they converted to the [[Avro Lancaster]]. The Squadron flew the Lancaster throughout the rest of the war. On November 7, 1943, C Flight was expanded to become [[No. 626 Squadron RAF|626 Squadron]] (a/c code UM), also flying the Lancaster. Wickenby played a large part in the bomber offensive, taking part in many of the major raids including: [[Berlin]], [[Munich]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Essen]], [[Mailly-le-Camp]], and [[Caen]]. Aircraft from Wickenby were also involved in [[Minelayer|mine-laying]] (gardening), and operations [[Operations Manna and Chowhound|Manna]] and Exodus. On September 24, 1945, 12 Squadron moved to a more permanent site at [[RAF Binbrook|Binbrook]]. 

12 Squadron still exists to this day flying [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]] aircraft out of [[RAF Lossiemouth|Lossiemouth]]. Having spent its entire existence at Wickenby, 626 Squadron was disbanded on October 14, 1945. The base was later taken over by No. 93 Maintenance Unit<ref>[http://raf-lincolnshire.info/93mu/93mu.htm 93 MU]</ref> and subsequently No. 92 Maintenance Unit<ref>[http://raf-lincolnshire.info/92mu/92mu.htm 92 MU]</ref> who used the runways to dismantle ordinance until 1956 when the base was closed. Civil aviation and maintenance began in 1963, and the land was sold between 1964-6. During the relatively short period of active service 1080 lives were lost from RAF Wickenby. This sacrifice is commemorated by the RAF Wickenby Memorial<ref>[http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/798954 RAF Wickenby Memorial]</ref> in the form of Icarus on an obelisk at the entrance to the airfield. The memorial was placed there by members of the Wickenby Register, an association of former 12/626 Squadron personnel and associate relatives.

==Post-war use==
The north part of the former airfield is now known as [[Wickenby Aerodrome]], which is a grass and concrete airfield.<ref>[http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/798959 Wickenby Airport]</ref> A road from Holton cum Beckering to [[Snelland]]<ref>[http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/329979 Wickenby Airfield]</ref> runs right over the former airfield. Companies based at the airfield are Thruster Aircraft who make [[Ultralight aviation|microlight planes]]; Fly365 Ltd who fly pleasure flights; and Rase Distribution - a haulage firm. Planes using the airfield have to make contact first with the control tower at [[RAF Waddington]].
The Watch Office is the home of the RAF Wickenby Memorial Collection and the Wickenby Archive, a collection of memorabelia and archive dedicated to the memory of the Squadrons who served here.
