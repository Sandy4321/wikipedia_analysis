'''WSB-TV''', [[virtual channel|channel]] 2, is an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-[[network affiliate|affiliated]] [[television station]] located in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[United States]]. The station's studios and offices are located on [[Peachtree Street|West Peachtree Street]] in [[Midtown Atlanta]], and its [[WSB-TV tower|transmission tower]] borders the city's [[Poncey-Highland]] and [[Old Fourth Ward]] neighborhoods.

WSB-TV is the [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] television property of [[Cox Media Group]], and is one of several flagship properties of Atlanta-based [[Cox Enterprises]], which has owned the station since its inception: Cox also owns [[sister station|sister]] radio stations [[WSB (AM)|WSB]] (750 AM), [[WSB-FM]] (98.5 FM), [[WSBB-FM]] (95.5 FM), [[WSRV (FM)|WSRV]] (97.1 FM), and [[WALR-FM]] (104.1 FM), and publishes ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]''.

==History==

===As an NBC affiliate===
WSB-TV first began broadcasting on September 29, 1948, originally broadcasting on channel 8. It is the second-oldest station south of Washington, D.C.; only [[Richmond, Virginia]]'s [[WTVR-TV]] (channel 6) is older. The station was founded by [[James M. Cox]], publisher of ''The Atlanta Journal'', and who also owned WSB radio ([[WSB (AM)|AM 750]] and 104.5 FM, now on [[WSB-FM|98.5 FM]]). Cox owned WSB AM-FM-TV under the banner of [[Miami Valley]] Broadcasting Inc., which later changed its name to the current Cox Enterprises. The station was originally a primary [[NBC]] affiliate, owing to its radio sister's longtime affiliation with [[NBC Red Network|NBC Radio]]. It also carried some ABC programming (from 1949, shared with [[WAGA-TV]], channel 5) until WLWA-TV (channel 8; now [[WXIA-TV]], channel 11) [[signon|signed on]] in 1951.

At that time, its present channel 2 [[table of allotments|allocation]] was licensed to the ''Journal's'' rival newspaper ''The Atlanta Constitution'', who had plans to establish WCON-TV there. In 1950, the two newspapers [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution|merged]]. At the time, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] did not allow one entity to own two television stations in the same market. As a result, WCON-TV and WSB-TV merged, operating under WSB-TV's license but using the stronger channel 2. The channel 8 allocation was eventually given to WLWA as an ABC affiliate. When that station moved to channel 11 in 1953, channel 8 was reserved as a [[non-commercial educational]] allocation by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), and is now [[WGTV (TV)|WGTV]], the [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] television station of [[Georgia Public Broadcasting]].

In 1955, the WSB stations moved into the noted "White Columns" building, designed and built according to the [[Colonial Revival]] style, a defining characteristic of Atlanta architecture. They would remain there for 43 years, until a much more [[Modern architecture|modernist]] concrete and glass facility was built adjacent to it (on the same property) in 1998. The new building, which has been dubbed "Digital White Columns" by some, is located just off Atlanta's famed [[Peachtree Street]], on the [[cul-de-sac|dead-end]] northern portion of West Peachtree Street which is actually ''east'' of Peachtree Street. This is near the [[Brookwood Hills]] area, and just east of the "Brookwood split", a [[highway interchange]] where the [[Downtown Connector]] splits into Interstates [[Interstate 75 in Georgia|75]] and [[Interstate 85 in Georgia|85]] on the north end. The older building was [[demolition|razed]] shortly after the new building was occupied. The original [[column]]s that stood on the front [[portico]] of the old building were placed in a garden area alongside the new building. Brand new white columns have been placed inside the [[atrium (architecture)|glass-enclosed]] [[lobby (room)|lobby]] of the newer building. WSB-TV is located less than one block south of the building formerly utilized by WXIA when that station moved its operations to [[WATL]]'s studios in 2008.

The station was the original local television broadcaster of the relocated [[Atlanta Braves]] baseball team, carrying the games from 1966 to 1972, until the Braves telecasts moved to WTCG (now [[WPCH-TV]]) in 1973. Its sister [[WSB (AM)|AM]] station was the longtime radio flagship of the Braves, carrying the broadcasts for 38 out of the 46 years that the franchise has been in Atlanta, dating back to 1966. [[Ernie Johnson (baseball pitcher)|Ernie Johnson, Sr.]], a former Braves pitcher and father of [[Ernie Johnson, Jr.|his namesake]] [[Turner Sports]] broadcaster, with future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] announcer [[Milo Hamilton]] (who simultaneously pulled double-duty anchoring Channel 2's sportscasts during this time) were the main announcers for what was then the largest television network in baseball.

In 1972, the station aired the name of a murdered rape victim in violation of Georgia's [[Rape shield law#Identification of alleged rape victims by media outlets|shield law]]. The station successfully overturned the law before the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn]]''.

===As an ABC affiliate===
{{Expand section|on WSB-TV's history under its current ABC affiliation|date=September 2010}}
ABC was the highest-rated network for most of the late 1970s and, at that time, was looking for stronger affiliates across the country, including Atlanta. ABC's longtime Atlanta outlet, WXIA, frequently traded second place with WAGA. However, WSB-TV was the far-and-away market leader despite being affiliated with last-place NBC. During the summer of 1980, both stations conducted an experiment unusual for a large market: WXIA aired NBC daytime shows in the morning and ABC daytime shows in the afternoon, while WSB aired ABC shows in the morning and NBC shows in the afternoons. By the time the experiment ended in September 1980, WSB-TV officially swapped affiliations with WXIA, and joined ABC.

On March 12, 2011, WSB-TV and [[WGCL-TV]] turned on their [[ATSC-M/H]] signals for the first time, becoming the first stations in the Atlanta area to offer [[Mobile DTV]] broadcasts.

With the loss of [[ABC Monday Night Football|NFL football on ABC]] in 2006, WSB-TV has aired [[Atlanta Falcons]] preseason games in recent years, making it one of two stations in Atlanta that air Falcons games not televised on the broadcast networks despite not having weekly regular-season network coverage.  (The other is [[Fox Sports South]], which airs the Falcons' ''[[ESPN Monday Night Football|ESPN Monday Night]]'' and ''[[NFL Network Thursday Night Football|NFL Network Thursday Night]] appearances.)

WSB-DT went on the air on April 17, 1998, making it one of the first regular-service [[digital television]] stations in the country (the -DT suffix is not mandated by the FCC, thus it is WSB-TV even for digital). The over-the-air [[digital subchannel]] 2.2 started carrying the [[Retro Television Network]] on January 28, 2008.<ref name="abizc">{{cite news|title=TV classics come to WSB with RTN|author = ''[[Atlanta Business Chronicle]]''|date=2007-11-20 |accessdate=2007-12-12|publisher = [[American City Business Journals]], Inc. |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2007/11/19/daily13.html?t=printable}}</ref> Prior to this, the channel was [[dead air|blank]], or later with a small [[station ID]] in the lower corner. RTV programming was replaced with Me-TV on June 1, 2011.

WSB-TV also has a [[mobile DTV]] feed of subchannel 2.1, labelled "WSB MH", broadcasting at 1.83 Mbit/s.<ref>[http://www.rabbitears.info/market.php?request=atscmph]</ref><ref>[http://www.mdtvsignalmap.com/ Mobile DTV Signal Map from the National Association of Broadcasters]</ref>

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
Don McClellan, celebrating 50 years at the station, shut down the station's analog signal for the last time on June 12, 2009 at 12:30 p.m., during a [[remote broadcast|live broadcast]] from the station's [[transmitter plant|transmitter room]] on the noon newscast, as part of the [[Digital television transition in the United States|digital television transition]]. The station's digital signal remained on [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel 39.<ref name="FCCForm387">[http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn=101231057&formid=387&fac_num=23960 CDBS Print<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It uses [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]] to display WSB-TV's [[virtual channel]] as 2 on digital television receivers.

During late August and into September 2009, the station removed its analog [[Television transmitter|transmitter]] from the top of the tower, and moved its side-mounted digital antenna up from its previous lower location on the tower.

In March 2009, the station filed applications for two digital fill-in [[broadcast translator|translator]]s (both of which also carry the WSB-TV callsign), due to expected loss of signal strength toward the east and northeast of Atlanta as a result of the shortcomings of the [[ATSC]] digital broadcast standard. The station's [[Gainesville, Georgia|Gainesville]]-[[city of license|licensed]] translator broadcasts on UHF channel 46, and began operations on June 26. It is located on the same [[radio tower]] as Cox's [[WSRV (FM)|WSRV]] FM and [[WSBB-FM]], and reaches as far into Atlanta's north-northeastern [[suburb]]s as [[Lilburn, Georgia|Lilburn]]. The [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]]-licensed translator broadcasts on UHF channel 31, with its transmitter located southwest of [[Winder, Georgia|Winder]], and its signal also reaches as far west as Lilburn. WSB-TV requested [[special temporary authority]] to begin immediate operation of these stations, pending approval of its regular applications.

The [[broadcast range|signal coverage]] of both stations largely overlap with one another, and are almost entirely within the estimated coverage area of the main station, however [[distributed transmission]] ([[co-channel|on-channel]] [[Repeater#Usage|boosters]]) will not be used. The translators are intended to overcome the terrain obstructions caused by [[Stone Mountain]] to the east of the WSB transmitter, and were in operation by January 2011. The Athens station uses virtual channels 2.5 and 2.6 instead of 2.1 and 2.2, while the Gainesville station uses 2.7 and 2.8, allowing viewers to choose whichever station whose signal is better receivable at a given time (certain [[ATSC tuner]]s may have trouble with two stations using the same virtual channel, and even if not, the user would have to enter the channel number and press "channel-up" or "channel-down" buttons to access the alternates, which would not be separately labeled or identified by the tuner).

In late June 2009, the station also applied for a translator on channel 14 just southwest of [[Rome, Georgia|Rome]]. That translator would cover a significant portion of [[northwest Georgia]] from the same tower as [[WQTU (FM)|WQTU]] (102.3 FM) and [[WSRM (FM)|WSRM]] (93.5 FM), and the same site as [[WGPB (FM)|WGPB]] (97.7 FM), [[W212AR]] (90.3 FM), and [[W215BA]] (90.9 FM).<ref>[http://transition.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?type=0&list=1&dist=1&dlat2=34&mlat2=14&slat2=2&dlon2=85&mlon2=13&slon2=50&size=10]</ref> There is no STA request for this station however, and {{as of|2011|September|lc=on}} it is still listed as only an application. In October 2010, WSB-TV applied for and later received a [[construction permit]] for another translator southwest of Atlanta in [[Newnan, Georgia|Newnan]] on channel 17. This translator will be co-located on the same tower as Cox-owned [[WALR-FM]] (104.1), and less than {{convert|.25|mi|km}} west of another tower holding [[WBZY (FM)|WBZY]] (105.3 FM; which is not owned by Cox).<ref>[http://transition.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?type=0&list=1&dist=1&dlat2=33&mlat2=24&slat2=43&dlon2=84&mlon2=50&slon2=3&size=10]</ref>

==News operations==
[[File:WSB open.png|thumb|right|210px|WSB nightly newscast open.]]
WSB-TV presently broadcasts 41 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with six hours on weekdays and Sundays, and five hours on Saturdays); as such, WSB-TV is one of the few [[Big Three television networks|Big Three]] network affiliates to offer more than 35 hours of local news content each week and one of the few Big Three affiliates to carry a midday newscast on weekends. In addition, WSB-TV's weekend newscast output is larger than that of Fox owned-and-operated station [[WAGA]] (channel 5), which offers a larger overall weekly (and weekday) newscast output than WSB-TV. Appropriately for a station with roots in a newspaper, local news programming has had a strong presence on channel 2 since its debut, and it has led the news [[audience measurement|ratings]] in Atlanta for as long as records have been kept.

One factor behind its dominance is talent continuity, as many of the station's personalities have been on the air for 15 years or more. Monica Pearson (known as Monica Kaufman until 2005) had been the station's top anchorwoman since 1975, and was one of the first African-American female anchors in the South. Starting in 1994, her co-anchor had been John Pruitt, who started at channel 2 in 1973 before beginning a 16-year run at WXIA. Glenn Burns has been the main weatherman since 1981. Chuck Dowdle served as the station's [[sports director]] from 1985 until his retirement in December 2009. Pearson, Pruitt, Burns and Dowdle served as WSB's main anchor team from Pruitt's return to Channel 2 in 1994 until 2010 <U+2013> longer than any news team in Atlanta. On December 17, 2010, Pruitt retired from WSB-TV after 46 years in the business; this was followed two-and-a-half years later by Pearson's retirement on July 25, 2012, after a 37-year career.

WSB-TV became the second station in the Atlanta market (behind [[WXIA-TV]]) and the second Cox-owned station (behind [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]'s [[WFTV (TV)|WFTV]]) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[High-definition television|high definition]], on September 27, 2006 during its noon broadcast. With the switch came a new HD-ready set and a graphics package designed by [[Giant Octopus (company)|Giant Octopus]].

In mid-November 2009, reporter Tom Jones and a cameraman escaped serious injury when the [[telescopic cylinder|telescoping]] [[radio mast]] of their [[electronic news-gathering]] van (holding a [[microwave]] [[television antenna|antenna]] for the [[remote pickup unit]] used for [[outside broadcasting]]) contacted 115-[[kilovolt]] [[high-voltage]] [[Overhead power line|powerlines]] while leaving the [[Fulton County Jail]]. [[Georgia Power]] staff were surprised that anyone survived, but the two were treated for minor burns and [[smoke inhalation]] at [[Grady Memorial Hospital]] and released later in the day. The massive [[electric spark]] caused an explosion, left a [[Explosion crater|crater]] underneath the van, arced to and broke a water main, and caused a brief [[power outage]]; the vehicle was a [[total loss]].<ref>[http://broadcastengineering.com/eng/archive/news-photog-reporter-escape-injury-eng-van-accident-112409/ News photographer, reporter escape serious injury in ENG van accident], ''Broadcast Engineering'', November 24, 2009.</ref><ref>[http://www.ajc.com/news/wsb-tv-employees-survive-203866.html WSB-TV employees survive truck explosion], ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', November 18, 2009.</ref><ref>[http://www.tvtechnology.com/feature-box/0124/tv-eng-van-explodes/204092 TV ENG Van Explodes], ''TVTechnology'', November 19, 2009.</ref>

In July 2010, WSB-TV expanded its weekday morning newscast to 2<U+00BD> hours, with the start time moved to 4:30 a.m. It announced a news partnership with [[Telemundo]] affiliate [[WKTB-LD]] on August 23, 2010.<ref name=ajc-wktbwsb>{{cite news|title=Channel 2 WSB-TV, Telemundo in partnership|url=http://www.ajc.com/business/channel-2-wsb-tv-597602.html|accessdate=July 2, 2011|newspaper=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=August 23, 2010}}</ref> On May 26, 2011, WSB-TV debuted an hour-long 4 p.m. newscast, which replaced ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'' when the daytime talk show ended its 25-year run.<ref>[http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2010/11/23/47241/wsb-atlanta-announces-4-pm-newscast/ WSB Atlanta Announces 4 P.M.

==Out-of-market coverage==
Unlike the co-owned ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', WSB-TV has not abandoned service to outlying counties. In [[northwest Georgia]], it is carried in the counties covered by the [[Chattanooga]] DMA: [[Catoosa County, Georgia|Catoosa]], [[Dade County, Georgia|Dade]], [[Murray County, Georgia|Murray]], [[Walker County, Georgia|Walker]] and [[Whitfield County, Georgia|Whitfield]]. WSB is also carried in the far [[northeast Georgia]] counties in the [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]]/[[Spartanburg, South Carolina|Spartanburg]]/[[Asheville]] DMA in [[Elbert County, Georgia|Elbert]], [[Franklin County, Georgia|Franklin]], [[Hart County, Georgia|Hart]] and [[Stephens County, Georgia|Stephens]] counties.

In [[central Georgia]], WSB-TV is available to subscribers of co-owned cable provider [[Cox Communications]] in the [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]] area, although ABC programming is usually [[blackout (broadcasting)|blacked out]] by another local ABC affiliate, [[WGXA-DT2]]. Given the long distance to Middle Georgia, it is likely that WSB-TV is [[uplink]]ed to the [[AMC-10]] [[satellite TV|TV satellite]]. WSB is also carried in [[Vidalia, Georgia|Vidalia]] in the [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] DMA.

In south Georgia (as far south as the [[Florida]] border), it is carried on Cox Communications systems due to a historical lack of an ABC affiliate in the [[Albany, Georgia|Albany]] [[media market]] covering [[southwest Georgia]]. Since the market's NBC affiliate [[WALB]] began carrying ABC on its 10.2 [[digital subchannel]] in 2010, [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]]s for syndicated programming have become common. Given the long distance to South Georgia, it is likely that WSB-TV is [[uplink]]ed to the [[AMC-10]] [[satellite TV|TV satellite]]. [[Charter Communications]] also carries WSB for its subscribers in the town of [[Douglas, Georgia|Douglas]] in [[Coffee County, Georgia|Coffee County]].

In [[western North Carolina]] it was previously carried in the [[Cherokee County, North Carolina|Cherokee County]] town of [[Murphy, North Carolina|Murphy]], alongside [[Asheville, North Carolina]] ABC affiliate [[WLOS]].
