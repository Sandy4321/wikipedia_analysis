'''Freddy Quinn''' (born [[September 27]], [[1931]] in [[Hardegg (Nieder<U+00F6>sterreich)|Niederfladnitz]], [[Nieder<U+00F6>sterreich]]) is an [[Austria]]n singer and actor whose popularity within the [[German language|German-speaking]] world soared in the late [[1950]]s and [[1960s]].  Similar to [[Hans Albers]] two generations before him, Quinn adopted the [[persona]] of the rootless wanderer who goes to [[sea]] but longs for a home, family and friends.  Quinn's Irish-sounding name comes from his Irish born salesman father. His mother was an Austrian journalist.  He is often associated with the [[Schlager]] scene.

<blockquote>
Heimatlos sind viele auf der Welt,<br>
heimatlos und einsam wie ich.<br>
<U+00DC>berall verdiene ich mein Geld,<br>
doch es wartet keiner auf mich.<br>
Keine Freunde, keine Liebe,<br>
keiner denkt an mich das ganze Jahr.<br>
Keine Freunde, keine Liebe,<br>
wie es fr<U+00FC>her, fr<U+00FC>her einmal war.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
''In this world many people have no home to come to,<br>
''they have no home and are just as lonesome as I am.<br>
''I earn my money all over the place,<br>
''but no one is waiting for me.<br>
''No friends, no love,<br>
''no one thinks of me all year round.<br>
''No friends, no love,<br>
''the way it used to be back then.''

Freddy Quinn was born '''Franz Eugen Helmut Manfred Niedl-Petz''' in [[Lower Austria]] and grew up in [[Vienna]]. As a child he lived in the U.S. with his father but moved back to live with his mother in Europe. However, having left the landlocked country of [[Austria]] for [[Germany]], he was "discovered" in [[St. Pauli]], [[Hamburg]], and was offered his first record contract in [[1954 in music|1954]]. He represented Germany at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1956]] in [[Lugano]], [[Switzerland]] with the atypical song, "So geht das jede Nacht", about an unfaithful girlfriend who dates lots of men. His other songs are mostly about the endless sea and the solitary life in faraway lands. His first hit record was "Heimweh" ("[[Homesickness]]", aka "Brennend hei<U+00DF>er W<U+00FC>stensand", "Dort wo die Blumen bl<U+00FC>h'n" and "Sch<U+00F6>n war die Zeit", [[1956 in music|1956]]), a German version of [[Dean Martin]]'s "[[Memories Are Made of This]]". Other hits, often just as '''Freddy''', followed: "Die Gitarre und das Meer" (1959), "Unter fremden Sternen" (1959), "Irgendwann gibt's ein Wiedersehn" (1960), "[[La Paloma]]" (1961), "Junge, komm bald wieder" (1963). His popularity petered out in the [[1970s]], but Quinn continued performing in front of audiences who were growing old with him.

Starting in the late 1950s, Quinn also acted in several movies, again frequently cast as the seafaring loner. Titles include ''Freddy, die Gitarre und das Meer'' (1959), ''Freddy unter fremden Sternen'' (1959), ''Freddy und das Lied der S<U+00FC>dsee'' (1962), and ''Heimweh nach St. Pauli'' (1963). Subsequently, Quinn also performed on the stage in such diverse roles as Prince Orlofsky in ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'', the king in ''[[The King and I]]'', and Lord Fancourt Babberly in ''[[Charley's Aunt]]''.

Freddy Quinn was also an accomplished [[circus]] performer who stunned television audiences as a [[tightrope walking|tightrope walker]] performing live and without a safety net. On another occasion, which was also televised, he rode a [[lion]] inside a circus cage while the lion was balancing atop a moving surface.

In [[2004]] Quinn was charged with [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax evasion]]. He had declared [[Switzerland]] as his main residence while he had in fact been living in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]. He pleaded guilty, paid all his tax debts (more than [[Euro|<U+20AC>]] 900,000), and eventually was fined <U+20AC> 150,000.

Freddy Quinn still lives in Hamburg.
