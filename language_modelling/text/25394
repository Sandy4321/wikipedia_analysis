'''Jos<U+00E9> Abello Silva''' (born [[1945]]) was a top ranking member of [[Colombia]]'s notorious [[Medell<U+00ED>n Cartel]]. He was considered among the major [[drug traffickers]] in the [[Santa Marta]] region and the reputed chief of Caribbean coast operations on the cartel's behalf. During [[January 1987]], Abello Silva was included in a group of 128 major narcotics figures whose capture was ordered by [[Colombian President|President]] [[Virgilio Barco]]. Although he was captured in [[Barranquilla]] during that same month, he was released shortly thereafter, apparently with the help of Miguel Pinedo Barros, a senator in [[La Guajira]] and reputed protector of cocaine traffickers. 

He was indicted by a [[USA|United States]] federal [[grand jury]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], during 1987 on charges of conspiring to import and distribute cocaine into the United States. The [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] said that Abello "was considered a major transporter for the Medell<U+00ED>n cartel," responsible for "major shipments of cocaine and [[marijuana]] into the states." Abello was the cartel's chief of operations for Colombia's northern coast.  Specifically, the DEA estimated that Abello Silva's trafficking ring was responsible for the importation of more than 1,700 pounds of cocaine into the United States.<ref>Associated Press, October 11, 1989</ref>

==Arrest, Extradition and Sentencing==

Abello Silva was arrested Tuesday, [[October 11]], [[1989]], while dining at a restaurant in [[Bogot<U+00E1>]]. According to the Colombian Administrative Security Department, at the time of his arrest Abello was the seventh-ranking man in the Medell<U+00ED>n cartel hierarchy.  On [[October 16]], [[1989]], Abello Silva was transferred the custody of [[U.S. Marshals Service]] agents and was immediately put on a plane to [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].  His extradition brought to five the number of accused drug traffickers sent to the United States since  President [[Virgilio Barco]] re-established extradition on [[August 18]], [[1989]], in response to a string of assassinations attributed to the cocaine cartels. 

===Trial===

By the time he came to [[trial]] during [[April 1989]], the [[prosecution]] charged that Abello Silva had undergone [[plastic surgery]] to alter his appearance, had arranged numerous killings in Colombia, and had attempted to [[bribe]] the Colombian police who arrested him. According to the U.S. government, Abello Silva was guilty as charged and probably guilty of many other crimes. Abello Silva, however, claimed he is innocent, that he is a wealthy cattle rancher, automobile importer, and part-time bullfighter. He also claimed he was the victim of the complementary interests of a jailed Colombian intent on escaping punishment and a U.S. public prosecutor intent on showing progress in the that country's fight against drug dealers.<ref>R L Fricker.

===Sentencing===
On [[May 19]], [[1990]], [[Federal district]] Judge Thomas Brett in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] sentenced Jose Abello Silva to 30 years in prison and fined him $5 million dollars. Abello Silva was convicted on one count of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to import cocaine and [[marijuana]] into the United States and one count of conspiracy to possess drugs with the intent to distribute. In passing the sentence, Judge Thomas Brett said the [[treaty]] under which the defendant was extradited from Colombia during Fall 1989 provided a maximum sentence of 30 years. 

===Appeal===
Abello Silva attempted to [[appeal]] the court's decision, but the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]] concluded that he failed to substantially show the denial of a constitutional right as required by 28 [[U.S.C.]] [[<U+00A7>]] 2253(c)(2). His conviction became final on [[October 5]], [[1992]], and he filed this motion on [[January 26]], [[1999]]. Not only was his motion time-barred under the [[AEDPA]] but the trial court undoubtedly possessed jurisdiction over his offenses which violated 21 U.S.C. <U+00A7><U+00A7> 841, 846, 960(b)(1)(B), (G), and 963. No. 94-1905.<ref>''United States of America, Plaintiff - Appellee v. Jose Rafael Abello-Silva, Defendant-Appellant (N.D. Okla.) (D.C. No. 99-CV-298-C'')</ref>
