'''''Acidithiobacillus caldus''''' formerly belonged to the genus ''Thiobacillus'' prior to the year 2000, at which point it was reclassified along with a number of other bacterial species into one of three new genera that better categorize sulfur-oxidizing [[acidophiles]]..<ref name=Kelly>Kelly, Donovan P. and Ann P. Wood (2000). "Reclassification of some species of ''Thiobacillus'' to the newly designated genera ''Acidithiobacillus'' gen. nov., ''Halothiobacillus'' gen. nov. and ''Thermithiobacillus'' gen. nov."''International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology'''''50''': 511-516.</ref>. As a member of the [[Gammaproteobacteria]] class of [[Proteobacteria]], ''A. caldus'' may be identified as a [[Gram-negative]] bacterium that is frequently found in pairs<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. Considered to be one of the most common microbes involved in [[biomining]], it is capable of oxidizing reduced inorganic sulfur compounds (RISC's) that form during the breakdown of [[sulfide]] minerals<ref name=Rzhepishevska>Rzhepishevska, Olena I., et al. (2007). "Regulation of a novel ''Acidithiobacillus caldus'' gene cluster involved in metabolism of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds."''Applied Environmental Microbiology'''''73''' (22): 7367-7372.</ref>. The meaning of the prefix 'acidi-' in the name ''Acidithiobacillus'' comes from the Latin word 'acidus', signifying that members of this genus love a sour, acidic environment<ref name=Kelly>Kelly, Donovan P. and Ann P.

The species name, ''caldus'', is derived from the Latin word for 'warm' or 'hot', denoting this species' love of a warm environment.  

== History ==

''Thiobacillus caldus'' was reclassified into ''Acidithiobacillus'', one of three new genera (also including ''Halothiobacillus'' and ''Thermithiobacillus'') created to further classify members of the genus which fall into the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-classes of the ''Proteobacteria''<ref name=Kelly>Kelly, Donovan P. and Ann P. Wood (2000). "Reclassification of some species of ''Thiobacillus'' to the newly designated genera ''Acidithiobacillus'' gen. nov., ''Halothiobacillus'' gen. nov. and''Thermithiobacillus'' gen. nov."''International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology'''''50''': 511-516.</ref>. ''Thiobacillus'' species exhibit a tremendous amount of diversity in [[physiology]] as well as DNA composition, which was one reason for reclassification of this species into a new genus containing four species of [[acidophiles]] (microorganisms which function best in an acidic environment), some of which are also capable of oxidizing iron[II] and [[sulfide minerals]]<ref name=Kelly>Kelly, Donovan P. and Ann P. Wood (2000). "Reclassification of some species of ''Thiobacillus'' to the newly designated genera ''Acidithiobacillus'' gen. nov., ''Halothiobacillus'' gen. nov. and''Thermithiobacillus'' gen. nov."''International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology'''''50''': 511-516.</ref>. 

''A. caldus'', originally isolated from [[spoils]] of unneeded rocks encountered when mining coal, was the first [[acidophilic]] species of [[thermophilic]] ''Thiobacilli'' to be described<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. The [[type strain]] of this species, DSM 8584, also known as strain KU, has been deposited in the [[Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen ]], a collection of microorganisms in Germany<ref name=Kelly>Kelly, Donovan P. and Ann P. Wood (2000). "Reclassification of some species of ''Thiobacillus'' to the newly designated genera ''Acidithiobacillus'' gen. nov., ''Halothiobacillus'' gen. nov. and''Thermithiobacillus'' gen. nov."''International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology'''''50''': 511-516.</ref>. 

== Morphology ==

''Acidithiobacillus caldus'' is a short, [[rod]]-shaped, [[Gram-negative]] bacterium that possesses [[motility]] via a single polar [[flagellum]] located on its outer cell wall, which displays characteristics of a typical [[Gram-negative]] cell wall<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of ''Thiobacillus caldus'' sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. It is approximately 1 <U+03BC>m by 1-2 <U+03BC>m in length and frequently is found in pairs<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. 

Different strains of ''Acidithiobacillus caldus'' have been shown to vary in size when compared to one another. One of the smaller strains, BC13, has a diameter of approximately 0.7 <U+03BC>m and is about 1.2 <U+03BC>m in length, whereas strain KU is a little lengthier, with a diameter of approximately 0.8 <U+03BC>m and a length of about 1.8 <U+03BC>m<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. 

== Physiological Tolerance ==

''Acidithiobacillus caldus'' displays tolerance to a broad range of conditions, including acidic pH levels and temperature with the best growth occurring at a pH of 2.0 to 2.5 and a temperature of 45&nbsp;<U+00B0>C<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of ''Thiobacillus caldus'' sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. Optimal growth results in a short [[generation time]] of approximately 2-3 hours, depending on the environmental factors present<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of ''Thiobacillus caldus'' sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. ''A. caldus'' is not considered to be [[halophilic]] because it displayed no signs of growth in environments containing [[NaCl]]<ref name=You>You, Xiao-Yan, et al. (2011). "Unraveling the Acidithiobacillus caldus complete genome and its central metabolisms for carbon assimilation." ''Journal of Genetics and Genomics'''''38''' (6): 243-252.</ref>. 

=== Temperature ===

''Acidithiobacillus caldus'' is moderately [[thermophilic]] and thrives at an optimum temperature of 45&nbsp;<U+00B0>C<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. Certain strains, such as strain KU, have still been shown to exhibit growth on a [[tetrathionate]] medium in conditions with a temperature range as low as 32&nbsp;<U+00B0>C and as high as 52&nbsp;<U+00B0>C<ref name=You>You, Xiao-Yan, et al. (2011). "Unraveling the Acidithiobacillus caldus complete genome and its central metabolisms for carbon assimilation." ''Journal of Genetics and Genomics'''''38''' (6): 243-252.</ref>. When grown on a medium containing sulfur, strain BC13 has been found to tolerate temperatures as high as 55&nbsp;<U+00B0>C<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. It is thought in the scientific community that there is a genetic basis for the extreme temperature tolerance depictive of ''A. caldus'' as compared to other species in its genus, such as ''A. ferrooxidans'' and ''A. thiooxidans''<ref name=Valdez>Valdes, Jorge, Inti Pedroso, Raquel Quatrini, and David S. Holmes. (2008). "Comparative genome analysis of ''Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans'', ''A. thiooxidans'' and ''A. caldus'': insights into their metabolism and ecophysiology." ''Hydrometallurgy'' '''94''': 180-184.</ref>.

=== pH ===

As with all [[acidophilic]] microorganisms, ''A. caldus'' thrives best in an environment with a low, acidic pH with a preferred pH range of 2.0-2.5<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. This microorganism is capable of coping with a large pH gradient across the cellular membrane, keeping its [[intracellular]] pH around a nearly neutral level of 6.5<ref name=Mangold>Mangold, Stephanie, et al. (2013). "Response of ''Acidithiobacillus caldus'' toward suboptimal pH conditions." ''Extremophiles'''''17''' (4): 689-696.</ref>. Certain strains, including KU and BC13, have been found to display signs of growth in a broad, acidic pH range, with a slow growth rate involving a longer [[generation time]], approximately 45 hours, at a pH of 4.0 and a rate of 6-7 hours at a pH of 1.0<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. ''A. caldus'' has its shortest generation time of 2-3 hours in conditions involving a pH between 2.0 and 2.5<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. No growth was observed at a pH of 0.5<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>, showing that some conditions are simply too acidic to support the growth of even extreme acidophiles.

== Metabolism ==

''A. caldus'' is capable of oxidizing reduced inorganic sulfur compounds along with other [[substrates]] including molecular [[hydrogen]], [[ferrous]] iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>), and [[formate]], in addition to numerous organic compounds and [[sulfide minerals]]<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. It displays [[chemolithotrophic]] growth when exposed to substrates containing sulfur, [[tetrathionate]], or [[thiosulfate]], with [[sulfate]] being produced as the end-product<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. Reduced sulfur compounds are utilized by ''A. caldus'' in order to support its [[autotrophic]] growth in an environment which lacks sunlight<ref name=Kelly>Kelly, Donovan P. and Ann P. Wood (2000).

It has been found that the growth of ''A. caldus'' is enhanced when the air used for [[sparging]], a process by which bubbles of a chemically [[inert]] gas are pumped through a liquid, is supplemented with 2% (w/v) CO<sub>2</sub><ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. Neither 0.05% [[yeast extract]] (a yeast product formed when a cell's walls are removed and its internal contents are extracted<ref name=Herbst>Herbst, Sharon (2001). Food Lover's Companion. Hauppauge, New York: Barron's Educational Series, Inc.</ref>), [[Casamino acids]] (an [[amino acid]]/[[peptide]] mixture common to microbial [[growth media]] formed from the acid [[hydrolysis]] of [[casein]]<ref name=Mueller>Mueller, J. Howard and Everett R. Johnson. (1941). "Acid hydrolysates of casein to replace peptone in the preparation of bacteriological media".

B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. Instead, growth is seen to occur [[mixotrophically]] with [[tetrathionate]] and yeast extract or glucose<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. It has been noted that strain BC13 is capable of growth on a [[glucose]] medium, but not after being transferred to a glucose medium from one that contained sulfur in addition to glucose<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>.

The principle function of bacteria involved in [[bioleaching]] is to oxidize [[ferrous]] iron to [[ferric]] iron (Fe<sup>3+</sup>), which carries out the oxidization of sulfur and provides energy for essential metabolic functions<ref name=Rzhepishevska>Rzhepishevska, Olena I., et al.

"Regulation of a novel ''Acidithiobacillus caldus'' gene cluster involved in metabolism of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds."''Applied Environmental Microbiology'''''73''' (22): 7367-7372.</ref>. The hydrolysis of [[tetrathionate]] by the key enzyme tetrathionate hydrolase (tetH), composed of 503 amino acids, yields pentathionate, [[thiosulfate]], and sulfur, while elemental sulfur is oxidized by [[sulfite]] into [[sulfate]]<ref name=Rzhepishevska>Rzhepishevska, Olena I., et al.

== Genomics ==

Most of what is known about the genus ''Acidithiobacillus'' comes from experimentation and genomic analyses of two of its species: ''A. ferrooxidans'' and ''A. caldus''. With a length of 2,932,225 base pairs, the genomic sequence of ''A. caldus'' is GC-rich with a [[GC content]] (mol%) in the range of 63.1-63.9% for strain KU<ref name=You>You, Xiao-Yan, et al. (2011). "Unraveling the ''Acidithiobacillus caldus'' complete genome and its central metabolisms for carbon assimilation." ''Journal of Genetics and Genomics'' '''38''' (6): 243-252.</ref> and 61.7% for strain BC13<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. [[DNA hybridization]] studies have revealed that strains KU and BC13 exhibited 100% [[homology]] with each other, yet showed no [[DNA hybridization]] of significance (2-20%) with other species in the genus including ''A. ferrooxidans'' and ''A. thiooxidans'', or with other similar [[Proteobacteria]], such as ''Thiomonas cuprina'' or ''Thiobacillus thioparus''<ref name=Kelly>Kelly, Donovan P. and Ann P. Wood (2000).

== Applications ==

Since its discovery in 1994, ''A. caldus'' has been found to have a significant practical application in the industrial field of [[biomining]] and mineral biotechnology, contributing to the enhanced recovery of desired minerals from rocks known as [[ores]]<ref name=Rzhepishevska>Rzhepishevska, Olena I. et al. (2007). "Regulation of a novel ''Acidithiobacillus caldus'' gene cluster involved in oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds." ''Applied and Environmental Microbiology'' '''73''' (22): 7367-7372.</ref>. Metals such as gold have been recovered from [[ores]] which contain [[pyrite]] (also known as [[Fool's Gold]]) and [[arsenopyrite]], two [[sulfide]] minerals that are often associated with considerable amounts of this precious metal<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>

[[Biomining]] refers to both biooxidation, where the sulfide mineral surrounding the desired metal is oxidized to expose the metal of interest, and [[bioleaching]], where the sulfide mineral is [[solubilized]] to obtain the metal of interest<ref name=Rzhepishevska>Rzhepishevska, Olena I. et al. (2007). "Regulation of a novel ''Acidithiobacillus caldus'' gene cluster involved in oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds." ''Applied and Environmental Microbiology'' '''73''' (22): 7367-7372.</ref>. Due to the [[exothermic]] nature of [[bioleaching]], the [[thermophilic]] nature of ''A. caldus'' allows for less cooling and quicker rates of bioleaching overall<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. Bacteria belonging to the genus ''Acidithiobacillus'' possess the ability to oxidize sulfidic [[ores]] and thereby [[solubilize]] metals<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. This ability has contributed to a general public interest in this microorganism because of its application in the industrial [[bioleaching]] of metals from ores and because of its effective means by which to recover [[precious metals]]<ref name=Hallberg>Hallberg, Kevin B. and E. B<U+00F6>rje Lindstr<U+00F6>m. (1994). "Characterization of Thiobacillus caldus sp. nov., a moderately thermophilic acidophile." Microbiology 140 (12): 3451-3456.</ref>. Bacteria involved in [[bioleaching]] function primarily to produce Fe<sup>3+</sup> from the oxidation of ferrous iron, which is then used to carry out sulfur oxidization, which provides an essential energy source for important cellular metabolic functions<ref name=Rzhepishevska>Rzhepishevska, Olena I., et al.
