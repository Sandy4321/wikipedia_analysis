'''Anthony Clarke Booth''' [[Victoria Cross|VC]]  (21 April 1846 <U+2013> 8 December 1899) was an [[England|English]] recipient of the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces.

Born in [[Carrington, Nottingham]],<ref>BBC Nottingham [http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/nottingham/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8346000/8346899.stm Retrieved 19 June 2011.]</ref> he was 32 years old, and a [[sergeant]] in the [[80th Regiment of Foot (Staffordshire Volunteers)]] (later [[The South Staffordshire Regiment]]), [[British Army]] during the [[Zulu War]] when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

==Action==
On 12 March 1879 on the [[Intombe River]], [[South Africa]] (Zulu War), during an attack by very large numbers of the enemy, Colour-Sergeant Booth rallied a few men on the south bank of the river and covered the retreat of 50 soldiers and others for a distance of three miles. Had it not been for the coolness displayed by this NCO not one man would have escaped. He later achieved the rank of [[Colour Sergeant]]. 

The London Gazette has him as a colour sergeant, but on the day of the Battle of Ntombe, (or [[Battle of Intombe]]) he was actually a sergeant, his promotion came the following day to replace a colour sergeant killed in the action. The gazetting of his VC was delayed due to the fact the surviving officer from the action Lt. Henry Hollingworth Harward was court-martialled for cowardice, the trial commenced on 20 February 1880 and concluded on 27 February 1880.  Harward escaped the charges brought against him for deserting his men and he resigned his commission in May 1880. During the course of the trial Booth's award appeared in the [[London Gazette]] on 24 February 1880.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Museum of the Staffordshire Regiment in [[Whittington, Staffordshire]].
