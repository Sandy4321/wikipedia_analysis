The '''''Type 1936B''''' class of [[destroyer]]s was a class of five destroyers built for the German [[Kriegsmarine]] between 1941 and 1942, of which only three - [[German destroyer Z36|''Z36'']], [[German destroyer Z35|''Z35'']], and [[German destroyer Z43|''Z43'']] - were commissioned and saw service. The ''Z36'' and ''Z35'' were lost in the [[Gulf of Finland]] after hitting friendly [[Naval mine |mines]],<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = ''Z36'' History | work = Kriegsmarine | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.german-navy.de/kriegsmarine/ships/destroyer/zerstorer1936b/z36/history.html | format = | doi = | accessdate = 21 Apr 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = ''Z35'' History | work = Kriegsmarine | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.german-navy.de/kriegsmarine/ships/destroyer/zerstorer1936b/z35/history.html | format = | doi = | accessdate = 21 Apr 2009 }}</ref> while ''Z43'' was scuttled near the end of the war.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = ''Z43'' History | work = Kriegsmarine | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.german-navy.de/kriegsmarine/ships/destroyer/zerstorer1936b/z43/history.html | format = | doi = | accessdate = 21 Apr 2009 }}</ref> 

==Design==
The Type 1936B destroyer class differed from the previous Type 1936A class in several ways. One was that the twin {{convert|15|cm|in|adj=on}} turrets, positioned fore and aft, were removed because the older Type 1936As had been found to be too unstable in heavy seas. <ref name=class>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Type 1936B destroyer class history | work = Kriegsmarine | publisher =www.german-navy.de | date = | url = http://www.german-navy.de/kriegsmarine/ships/destroyer/zerstorer1936b/index.html | format = | doi = | accessdate = 5 May 2010 }}</ref> These two twin turrets were removed and replaced with five single 15 cm (5.9 in) turrets.<ref>These had been originally intended for use on the planned [[O class battlecruiser]]s but diverted when they were canceled due to time constraints</ref> along with more anti-aircraft defences.<ref name=class/> Apart from some other minor modifications, the ships retained the main characteristics of the 1936A class. They displaced {{convert|2527|t|LT}}, and were manned by a crew of 321 officers and men.<ref name=battleship>{{cite web |ref=harv|date= 2010 |year= 2010|url = http://www.battleships-cruisers.co.uk/german_destroyers.htm|title = German Destroyers|format = |publisher = Battleships-Cruisers.co.uk| accessdate = May 7, 2010 | last=Battleships-Cruisers.co.uk| first= |quote=}}</ref>  Although they had a maximum speed of {{convert|36.5|kn|lk=on}}, their range was {{convert|2600|nmi|km}} at {{convert|19|kn|lk=on}}.<ref name=battleship/> The main armament of five [[15 cm SK C/28]] guns <ref name=battleship/> could be depressed to -10<U+00B0> and elevated to 35<U+00B0>.<ref name=navweap>{{cite web |ref=harv|date= 2010 |year= 2010|url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_59-55_skc28.htm|title = German 15 cm/55 (5.9") SK C/28|format = |publisher = navweaps.com| accessdate = May 7, 2010 | last= DiGiulian | first= Tony|quote=}}</ref>  The turrets had an arc of fire of 360<U+00B0>, able to fire at any given point.<ref name=navweap/> The guns fired {{convert|45.3|kg|lb|adj=on}} armor piercing or high explosive shells at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|875|m/s|ft/s}} to a range of {{convert|23000|m|yd}}.<ref name=navweap/> The destroyers also carried four {{convert|37|mm|in|adj=on}} anti-aircraft guns and six {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} anti-aircraft guns in pairs.<ref name=battleship/> They had eight 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes and, when fitted as a minelayer, could carry 76 mines. <ref name=battleship/>
