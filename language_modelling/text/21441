'''Kick start''' refers to a method of starting an [[internal combustion engine]] (usually that of a [[motorcycle]]) by pushing a [[Ratchet (device)|ratchet]]ing lever with one's foot. Kick start mechanisms were almost universally a part of motorcycle engines before the mid-1970s, and were phased out of production over the next twenty years or so as [[electric starter]]s became standard equipment. There are still some motorcycles produced that have both a kick and electric starters. 

Many [[moped]]s and [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]] also carry both a kick start and an electric start, the former being useful in case the latter fails, as scooter and moped batteries tend to be smaller and, as a result, run down much faster than other forms of automotive batteries. Also, it is usually not possible to [[push start]] a moped or scooter with [[automatic transmission]].

Larger motorcycles featured a manual [[compression release]] mechanism that made starting easier while modern units did this automatically through a cable attached to the kick start lever.

Today, dedicated off-road motorcycles and many [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV]]s use kick start systems due to the increased weight of electric starters.  The majority of the inexpensive two-wheelers and sometimes three-wheelers in developing countries also use kick start levers.

The first kick start motorcycle was a British [[The Scott Motorcycle Company|Scott Motorcycle]] two-stroke twin manufactured in 1910.<ref>{{Citation |last1= Brown |year=1996 |first1=Roland |title=The Encyclopedia of Motorcycles |publisher=Smithmark |isbn=0831728485 |page=12}}</ref>
