<!-- Created with subst: of [[Template:Hurricane season single]]. -->The '''1936 Atlantic hurricane season''' officially began on [[June 1]], [[1936]], and lasted until [[November 30]], [[1936]]. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most [[tropical cyclone]]s form in the [[Atlantic basin]].

The 1936 season was fairly active, with 17 tropical cyclones including a tropical depression. Seven became hurricanes, of which one became a major hurricane. Despite the activity, conditions were generally unfavorable throughout the season. In addition, the season was unusual in the fact that no storms moved across large portions of the [[Caribbean Sea]].<ref name="tropdist">{{cite web|author=I. R. Tannehill|year=1936|title=Tropical Disturbances of 1936|publisher=U.S. Weather Bureau|accessdate=2006-09-09|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/064/mwr-064-12-0427.pdf}}</ref> Seven storms, including three hurricanes, struck the [[United States]]. The season also set many records for the earliest date for a numbered storm, though all were surpassed by the extreme activity of the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005 season]].

On [[June 9]], a [[1925-1949 Pacific hurricane seasons#1936 Season|tropical storm]] made landfall on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of [[Guatemala]]. It moved northeastward across [[Central America]], and entered the western [[Caribbean Sea]] on [[June 11]]. The storm quickly re-organized, and again developed into a tropical storm on [[June 12]]. It moved north-northeastward, resulting in light winds as it paralleled the eastern coasts of [[Belize]] and the [[Yucatan Peninsula]]. After reaching the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with peak winds of 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h), the storm turned to the northeast, then to the east. On [[June 15]], the tropical storm made landfall about 20&nbsp;miles (32&nbsp;km) to the south of [[Fort Myers, Florida]], and after crossing the state it passed over [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] before entering the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It weakened as it accelerated northeastward through the [[Bahamas]], and on [[June 17]] the system dissipated to the north of [[Bermuda]].<Ref name="mwr">{{Cite web|author=I. R.

While crossing Central America, the storm produced heavy rainfall. In southern [[Florida]], winds from the storm ranged from 30&nbsp;mph (48&nbsp;km/h) to a peak of 39&nbsp;mph (63&nbsp;km/h) in Miami. The storm produced heavy rainfall in southern Florida, ranging from 8 to 15&nbsp;inches (200 to 380&nbsp;mm). The rainfall caused flooding of highways and lowlands, drowned several livestock, and some damage. The storm caused three indirect deaths when a [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] airplane crashed in [[Tampa Bay]] while in search of small boats.<ref name="mwr"/>

An area of disturbed weather was first detected near the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] on [[June 18]]. It tracked west-northwestward, and developed into a tropical storm the following day. The storm continued to the west-northwest until [[June 21]], when the storm turned to the west-southwest. Having remained a minimal tropical storm for all of its lifetime, the 40&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;km/h) storm struck northeast [[Mexico]] on the 21st, and dissipated the next day. The storm caused higher than normal tides along the [[Texas]] coastline, and no damage or deaths were reported.<ref name="mwr"/>

A small tropical storm developed on [[June 26]] while located 125&nbsp;miles (200&nbsp;km) east of [[Brownsville, Texas]]. It moved northwestward and rapidly strengthened, attaining hurricane status with peak winds of 80&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h) by early on [[June 27]]. Later on the 27th, the hurricane made landfall near [[Port Aransas, Texas|Port Aransas]] with a pressure of 990&nbsp;[[mbar]]. The storm rapidly weakened over land, and dissipated on [[June 28]] near [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]. A small craft warning was issued for the [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] area on the morning of the storm making landfall, and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Weather Bureau]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|Hurricane Warning]] just 45 minutes prior to the hurricane striking land.<ref name="mwr"/>

Upon making landfall, the storm caused a 3.8&nbsp;feet (1.2&nbsp;m) [[storm tide]], and many small boats were capsized or driven ahore. The hurricane produced wind gusts of up to 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h) in [[Ingleside, Texas|Ingleside]] and up to 80&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h) in Port Aransas, destroying cooling towers at a local oil refinery and damaging a few houses.

On [[July 26]], a small tropical storm formed near the western tip of [[Cuba]] from a tropical disturbance. It moved quickly northwestward, then turned northward, reaching a peak intensity of 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h). On [[July 27]], the storm accelerated northeastward and made landfall on southeastern [[Louisiana]] with a pressure of 1003&nbsp;[[mbar]]. The storm rapidly weakened over land and dissipated late on the 27th.

The hurricane continued to strengthen, and hit the western [[Florida Panhandle]] with peak winds of 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h) on [[July 31]]. It weakened rapidly over land, and dissipated over western [[Alabama]] on [[August 1]].<ref name="mwr"/>

In south Florida, the storm caused a storm tide of 5.5&nbsp;feet (1.7&nbsp;m) when it made landfall, causing flooding of up to 1.5&nbsp;feet (0.5&nbsp;m) in coastal areas. Though winds reached 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h), damage was minimal there. In [[Valparaiso, Florida|Valparaiso]] in the Florida Panhandle, the hurricane produced wind gusts of up to 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h), along with a storm tide of 6&nbsp;feet (1.8&nbsp;m). Damage from the storm was relatively minor, totaling to $123,000 (1936&nbsp;USD, $1.78&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD).

After turning to the northeast, the hurricane reached a peak intensity of 110&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h) on [[September 22]] while located about 500&nbsp;miles (800&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Bermuda]]. It turned to the north and slowly weakened. A [[surface weather analysis|cold front]] turned the hurricane to the northeast, and the system became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] on [[September 25]] a short time before making landfall on southern [[Nova Scotia]]. Hours after hitting land, the extratropical remnant was absorbed by the approaching cold front. Impact, if any, is unknown.<ref name="mwr"/>{{clear}}

===Tropical Depression===
A tropical depression formed in the western [[Atlantic Ocean]] on [[September 25]]. It moved west-northwestward, making landfall on eastern [[Florida]] before entering the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on [[September 28]]. The depression turned to the northwest, and struck land near [[Apalachicola, Florida|Apalachicola]] as a minimal system. It dissipated over land on [[October 1]]. The minimum central pressure in the depression was 1006&nbsp;[[mbar]]. The depression produced winds of up to 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h) in [[Tarpon Springs, Florida|Tarpon Springs]]. Effects were minimal.<ref name="mwr"/>{{clear}}

An area of disturbed weather persisted across the northwestern [[Caribbean Sea]] in early October. It tracked northwestward over the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]], and subsequent to the development of a low-level circulation the system organized into a tropical storm on [[October 9]] while located about 60&nbsp;miles (100&nbsp;km) northwest of the [[Campeche, Campeche|capital]] of [[Campeche]]. After moving northward, the storm turned sharply southward, and made landfall in northern [[Tabasco]] as a minimal tropical storm on [[October 10]]. The system quickly weakened over land, and dissipated over [[Chiapas]] on [[October 11]]. The system dropped heavy rainfall across southeastern [[Mexico]], though damage, if any, is unknown.<ref name="mwr"/><ref name="unisys"/>

==Accumulated Cyclone Energy Rating (ACE)==

The table below shows the [[Accumulated Cyclone Energy|ACE]] for each storm in the season. Broadly speaking, the ACE is a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the duration of its lifetime; thus, hurricanes that lasted a long time (such as Thirteen) have higher ACEs. Despite the high number of storms, most were relatively short-lived and weak, and the ACE only suggested a near-normal season. The ACE rating is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 35 knots (39 mph/63 km/h) or tropical storm strength.
