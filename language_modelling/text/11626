<!-- Please do NOT change the first name to "Jean-Baptiste", it is NOT correct!! -->
'''Jean''' <ref>His official forename was not "Jean-Baptiste" as often cited. The name on his birth certificate is "Reinhardt, Jean". His biographer Michael Dregni states that "Jean Reinhardt" is the name used on all official documents. {{cite book|first=Michael|last=Dregni|title=Django: The Life and Music of a Gypsy Legend|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-19-516752-X|pages=4<U+2013>5}}</ref> '''"Django" Reinhardt''' ({{IPA-fr|d<U+0292><U+0251><U+0303><U+0261>o <U+0281>en<U+0251><U+0281>t}}; 23 January 1910 - 16 May 1953) was a pioneering virtuoso [[jazz]] guitarist and composer.

Born into a family of [[Romani]] gypsies Reinhardt invented an entirely new style of jazz guitar technique (sometimes called 'hot' jazz guitar) that has since become a [[Gypsy jazz|living musical tradition]] within French [[gypsy]] culture. With violinist [[St<U+00E9>phane Grappelli]], he co-founded the [[Quintette du Hot Club de France]], described by critic Thom Jurek<ref>http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:dzfqxql0ldte~T1</ref> as "one of the most original bands in the history of recorded jazz." Reinhardt's most popular compositions have become [[jazz standards]], including  "[[Minor Swing (song)|Minor Swing]]", "Daphne",  "[[Belleville]]", "Djangology", "Swing '42" and "[[Nuages (song)|Nuages]]" (French for "Clouds").

==Biography==
===Childhood===
Born in [[Liberchies]], [[Pont-<U+00E0>-Celles]], Belgium, Reinhardt's nickname "Django" is [[Romani language|Romani]] for "I awake."<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Dregni|title=Django: The Life and Music of a Gypsy Legend|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-19-516752-X|pages=1, 5}}</ref> He spent most of his youth in [[Romani people|Romani]] (Gypsy) encampments close to Paris, playing [[banjo]], guitar and violin from an early age. His family made [[Caning (furniture)|cane furniture]] for a living, but included several keen amateur musicians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|page=14}}</ref>

He started first on the violin and eventually moved on to a [[Guitjo (six-string)|banjo-guitar]] that had been given to him as a gift. His first known recordings (in 1928) were of him playing the banjo. During this period he was influenced by two older gypsy musicians, the banjoist [[Gusti Mahla]] and the guitarist [[Jean "Poulette" Castro]]. Able to make a living in music from his early teens onwards, he received little formal education and only acquired the rudiments of literacy in adult life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|page=13}}</ref>

===The injury===
At the age of 18, Reinhardt was injured in a fire that ravaged the caravan he shared with [[Florine "Bella" Mayer]], his first wife.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Dregni|title=Gypsy Jazz: In Search of Django Reinhardt and the Soul of Gypsy Swing|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-531192-1|pages=46<U+2013>50}}</ref> They were very poor, and to supplement their income Bella made imitation flowers out of [[celluloid]] and paper.  Consequently, their home was full of this highly flammable material. Returning from a performance late one night, Reinhardt apparently knocked over a candle on his way to bed. While his family and neighbours were quick to pull him to safety, he received first- and second-degree burns over half his body.  His right leg was paralysed and the third and fourth fingers of his left hand were badly burned. Doctors believed that he would never play guitar again and intended to amputate one of his legs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|pages=43<U+2013>44}}</ref> Reinhardt refused to have the surgery and left the hospital after a short time; he was able to walk within a year with the aid of a cane.

His brother [[Joseph Reinhardt]], an accomplished guitarist himself, bought Django a new guitar. With rehabilitation and practice he relearned his craft in a completely new way, even as his third and fourth fingers remained partially paralysed. He played all of his guitar solos with only two fingers, and used the two injured digits only for chord work.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|pages=31<U+2013>35}}</ref>

In 1929, Reinhardt's estranged wife Florine gave birth to a son named Henri "Lousson" Reinhardt (aka Lousson Baumgartner).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotclub.co.uk/gypsyworld/index.php?title=Lousson_Reinhardt|title=Lousson Reinhardt|work=Gypsy Jazz Encyclopedia|accessdate=7 April 2010}}</ref>

===Discovery of jazz===
The period between 1929 and 1933 were formative years for Reinhardt. He decisively abandoned the banjo-guitar in favour of the guitar. He was particularly impressed with [[Louis Armstrong]], whom he called "my brother".<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|page=50}}</ref> Shortly afterwards he made the acquaintance of a young violinist with very similar musical interests &mdash; St<U+00E9>phane Grappelli. In the absence of paid work in their radical new music, the two would [[jam]] together, along with a loose circle of other musicians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|page=26}}</ref>

===Formation of the quintet===
In 1934, Reinhardt and Parisian violinist Grappelli were invited to form the "[[Quintette du Hot Club de France]]" with Reinhardt's brother [[Joseph Reinhardt|Joseph]] and [[Roger Chaput]] on guitar, and [[Louis Vola]] on bass.<ref>{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Dregni|title=Django Reinhardt and the Illustrated History of Gypsy Jazz|publisher=Speck Press|year=2006|isbn=978-1-933108-10-0|pages=45<U+2013>59}}</ref> Occasionally Chaput was replaced by Reinhardt's best friend and fellow Gypsy [[Pierre Ferret|Pierre "Baro" Ferret]]. The vocalist [[Freddy Taylor]] participated in a few songs, such as "[[Georgia On My Mind]]" and "[[Nagasaki (song)|Nagasaki]]". [[Jean Sablon]] was the first singer to record with him more than 30 songs from 1933. They also used their guitars for percussive sounds, as they had no true percussion section. The Quintette du Hot Club de France was one of the few well-known jazz ensembles composed only of string instruments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|pages=64<U+2013>66}}</ref>
In Paris on 14 March 1933 Reinhardt recorded two takes each of "Parce que je vous aime" and "Si, j'aime Suzy", vocal numbers with lots of guitar fills and guitar support, using three guitarists along with an [[accordion]] lead, violin, and bass.<ref name="djangomontreal.com">http://www.djangomontreal.com/doc/Disco33.htm</ref> In August of the following year recordings were also made with more than one guitar (Joseph Reinhardt, Roger Chaput, and Django), including the first recording by the Quintette.<ref name="ReferenceA">http://www.djangomontreal.com/doc/Disco34.htm</ref> In both years, it should be noted, the great majority of recordings featured a wide variety of horns, often in multiples, piano, and other instruments.<ref name="djangomontreal.com"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Reinhardt also played and recorded with many American jazz musicians such as [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Benny Carter]], [[Rex Stewart]] (who later stayed in Paris), and a jam-session and radio performance with [[Louis Armstrong]]. Later in his career he played with [[Dizzy Gillespie]] in France. Reinhardt and the Hot Club of France used the [[Selmer Maccaferri]], the first commercially available guitars with a [[Cutaway (guitar)|cutaway]] and later with an aluminium-reinforced neck.

===World War II===
When [[World War II]] broke out, the original quintet was on tour in the United Kingdom. Reinhardt returned to Paris at once,<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|pages=98<U+2013>99}}</ref> leaving his wife behind. Grappelli remained in the United Kingdom for the duration of the war. Reinhardt reformed the quintet, with [[Hubert Rostaing]] on [[clarinet]] replacing Grappelli's violin. In 1943, Reinhardt married Sophie "Naguine" Ziegler in [[Salbris]], with whom he had a son, [[Babik Reinhardt]], who became a respected guitarist in his own right.<ref>www.hotclub.co.uk/html/babik.html</ref>

Reinhardt survived the war unscathed, unlike many Romanis who perished in the [[Porajmos]], the [[Nazi]] regime's systematic murder of several hundred thousand European Romanis. He was well aware of the dangers he and his family faced, and made several unsuccessful attempts to escape occupied France. Part of the explanation of his survival is that he enjoyed the protection of (surreptitiously) Jazz-loving Nazis such as Luftwaffe officer Dietrich Schulz-K<U+00F6>hn, nicknamed "Doktor Jazz".<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/djangoreinhardt.shtml BBC Radio 4  ''Django, Jazz and the Nazis'']</ref>

Reinhardt's problems were doubled by the fact that the Nazis also officially disapproved of Jazz .<ref>[http://holocaustmusic.ort.org/politics-and-propaganda/third-reich/jazz-under-the-nazis/ Jazz under the Nazis]</ref> Reinhardt became interested in other musical directions, attempting to write a Mass for the Gypsies and Symphony (since he could not write music, he would perform improvisations to be notated by an assistant). His modernist piece ''Rhythm Futur'' was intended to be acceptably un-jazz-like. <!--Reinhardt's pot war poverty, fishing painting and wandering, ref Dregni-->

===US tour===
[[File:Django Reinhardt (Gottlieb 07301).jpg|thumb|Django Reinhardt, Aquarium, New York, 1946]]

After the war, Reinhardt rejoined Grappelli in the UK, and then went on in fall 1946 to tour the [[United States]] as a special guest soloist with [[Duke Ellington]] and His Orchestra, when he got to play with many notable musicians and composers such as [[Maury Deutsch]]. At the end of the tour he played two nights at [[Carnegie Hall]]; he received a great ovation and took six curtain calls on the first night. Despite Reinhardt's great pride in touring with Ellington (one of his two letters to Grappelli relates this excitement), he was not really integrated into the band, playing only a few tunes at the end of the show, backed by Ellington, with no special arrangements written personally for him. After the tour he got an engagement at Caf<U+00E9> Society Uptown, where he did four solos a day, backed by the resident band, which drew large audiences.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|pages=138<U+2013>139}}</ref>

Reinhardt was reportedly given an untuned guitar to play with (discovered after strumming a chord) and it took him five whole minutes to tune it. Having failed to take along a Selmer Mod<U+00E8>le Jazz, the guitar he made famous, he had to play on a haphazardly borrowed electric guitar, which failed to bring out the delicacy of his style.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|page=138}}</ref>

Django Reinhardt was among the first people in France to appreciate the music of [[Charlie Parker]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]], whom he sought when he arrived in New York. They were both on tour at the time, however. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

He had been promised some jobs in California but these failed to materialize and he got tired of waiting. He returned to France in February 1947.<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|page=141}}</ref>

===After the quintet===
After returning to France, Reinhardt spent the remainder of his days re-immersed in Romani life, having found it difficult to adjust to the modern world. He would sometimes show up for concerts without a guitar or amp, or wander off to the park or beach, and on a few occasions he refused even to get out of bed. Reinhardt was known by his band, fans, and managers to be extremely unpredictable. He would often skip sold-out concerts to simply "walk to the beach" or "smell the dew".<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|pages=145<U+2013>160}}</ref>

In Rome in 1949, Reinhardt recruited three Italian jazz players (on bass, piano, and snare drum) and recorded his final (double) album, "Djangology". He was once again united with Grappelli, and returned to his acoustic Selmer-Maccaferri. The recording was discovered and issued for the first time in the late 1950s.<ref>[http://www.paulvernonchester.com/DjangoInRome.htm ''Django in Rome'' by Paul Vernon Chester]</ref>

===Final years===
In 1951, he retired to [[Samois-sur-Seine]], near [[Fontainebleau]], where he lived until his death. He continued to play in Paris jazz clubs and began playing electric guitar, despite his initial hesitation towards the instrument. His final recordings made in the last few months of his life show him moving in a new musical direction; he had assimilated the vocabulary of [[bebop]] and fused it with his own melodic style.<ref>{{cite book|first=Benjamin|last=Givan|title=The Music of Django Reinhardt|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-472-03408-6|pages=158<U+2013>94}}</ref>

While walking from the [[Avon, Seine-et-Marne|Avon]] train station after playing in a Paris club he collapsed outside his house from a [[brain hemorrhage]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|page=160}}</ref>
It was a Saturday and it took a full day for a doctor to arrive <ref>{{cite book|last=Delaunay|first=Charles|title=Django Reinhardt|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1961|isbn=0-306-80171-X|page=161}}</ref> and Reinhardt was declared [[dead on arrival]] at the hospital in Fontainebleau.

==Legacy==
{{Main|Gypsy jazz}}
For about a decade after Reinhardt's death, interest in his musical style was minimal, with the fifties seeing [[bebop]] superseding [[swing music|swing]] in jazz, the rise of [[rock and roll]], and electric instruments taking over from acoustic ones in popular music. His second son, [[Babik Reinhardt|Babik]], was a guitarist in the contemporary jazz style. His first son, Lousson, was more of a traditionalist, but followed the Romani lifestyle and rarely performed in public. Reinhardt's friends and sidemen [[Pierre Ferret]] and his brothers continued to perform their own version of gypsy swing.

There was a revival of interest in Reinhardt's music from the mid sixties, with acoustic music having become popular through the [[folk music|folk]] movement. Several of Reinhardt's near-contemporaries recorded for the first time in the sixties and seventies, for instance Paul "Tchan Tchou" Vidal. Reinhardt's own brother [[Joseph Reinhardt|Joseph]] had initially sworn to abandon music on hearing of Reinhardt's death, but was persuaded to start performing and recording again.

In 1973 St<U+00E9>phane Grappelli formed a successful Quintette-style band with British guitarists [[Diz Disley]] and [[Denny Wright]]. Grappelli would go on to form many other musical partnerships, including [[John Etheridge]] and [[Nigel Kennedy]]. He was also to acquire his own emulators, for instance [[Dutch people|Dutch]] violinist [[Tim Kliphuis]].

New generations began to emerge, for instance, [[Jimmy Rosenberg|Jimmy]] and [[Stochelo Rosenberg]] and their relatives from the [[Netherlands]]. Another musical clan is the Reinhardt brothers and cousins from [[Germany]], distant relatives of Reinhardt's. [[Boulou Ferr<U+00E9>]], son of "Matelot" Ferret was a child prodigy who entered the Paris Conservatoire at the age of 13, and studied under [[Olivier Messian]]. He continues to perform, with his brother Elios, and can mix bebop and even classical music with gypsy swing. [[Bir<U+00E9>li Lagr<U+00E8>ne]] and [[Angelo Debarre]] were other prodigies. There is now a third generation of direct descendants: Reinhardt's grandson (by his son Babik), David Reinhardt, leads his own trio; his grandson by Lousson, Dallas Baumgartner, is a guitarist who follows in his father's footsteps by traveling and keeping a low public profile.

Most of the above-mentioned are Roma who learned music by the 'gypsy method', involving intense practice, direct imitation of older musicians (often family members) and playing by ear, with little formal musical study (or, indeed, formal education of any kind). Since about the late 1970s, study materials of a more conventional kind such as workshops, books and videos have become available, allowing musicians worldwide to master the style.

Non-Roma prominent gypsy-style guitarists include [[John Jorgensen]], [[Jon Larsen]] (and his [[Hot Club de Norv<U+00E8>ge]], established 1979), [[Andreas <U+00D6>berg]], [[Frank Vignola]], [[George Cole]], [[Stephane Wrembel]] and [[Reynold Philipsek]]. Their music is sometimes jokingly referred to as "Gadjo jazz", where ''Gadjo'' is the Romani term for a non-Romani. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Young players such as [[Adrien Moignard]] and [[Gwenole Cahue]] represent the rising generation. Another sign of the rising popularity of gypsy jazz is the increasing number of festivals, such as the [[Samois-sur-Seine]] festival (started about 1980), and the various [[DjangoFest]]s held in the USA.

==Reinhardt in popular culture==
Reinhardt has been portrayed in several films, such as in the opening sequence of the 2003 animated film ''[[Les Triplettes de Belleville]]''. The third and fourth fingers of the cartoon Reinhardt are considerably smaller than the fingers used to play the guitar. Reinhardt's legacy dominates in [[Woody Allen]]'s 1999 ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]''. This spoof biopic focuses on fictional American guitarist Emmet Ray's obsession with Reinhardt, with soundtrack featuring [[Howard Alden]]. He is also portrayed by guitarist [[John Jorgenson]] in the movie ''[[Head in the Clouds]]''.

In the Italian western ''[[Django (film)|Django]]'', the title character is presumably named after Reinhardt. In the climax of the movie, his hands are smashed by his enemies and he is forced to fire a gun with his wounded hands. Reinhardt is also the idol of the character Arvid in the movie ''[[Swing Kids (film)|Swing Kids]]'', where the character's left hand is smashed by a member of the [[Hitler Jugend]], but is inspired by Reinhardt's example to keep playing. Similarly, in real life, [[Black Sabbath]] guitarist Tony Iommi suffered an industrial accident at 17, where the tips of his right middle and ring fingers were amputated on the last day of his job as at a sheet metal factory. His boss, in an effort to encourage Iommi to follow his dream of being a professional guitarist, [[Iommi#Early history|played a Django Reinhardt record for him for inspiration]].

Reinhardt's music has been used in the soundtrack of many films, including in ''[[The Matrix]]''; ''Rhythm Futur'', ''Daltry Calhoun'', ''[[Metroland (film)|Metroland]]'', ''[[Chocolat (2000 film)|Chocolat]]'', ''[[The Aviator]]'', ''[[Alex and the Gypsy]]'', ''[[Kate and Leopold]]'' and ''[[Gattaca]]''; the score for [[Louis Malle]]'s 1974 movie, ''[[Lacombe Lucien]]''; the background for the [[Steve Martin]] movie ''[[L.A. Story]]''; and the background for a number of [[Woody Allen]] movies, including ''[[Stardust Memories]]''. He also appeared as a character in Allen's ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]''. Reinhardt's music has also been featured in the soundtracks of several video games, such as the 2002 game ''[[Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven]]'', ''[[Mafia II]]'' <ref>[http://www.mafia2game.com/community/us/features_song_list.php The MAFIA II full song list]</ref> and several times in the 2007 game ''[[BioShock]]''.

Reinhardt has been the subject of several songs, most notably "Django" (1954), a gypsy-flavoured piece that jazz pianist [[John Lewis (pianist)|John Lewis]] of the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]] wrote in honour of Reinhardt; numerous versions of the song have been recorded, including one on the 1973 [[Lindsey Buckingham]]/[[Stevie Nicks]] self-titled debut album; it also appears on [[Joe Bonamassa]]'s 2006 LP ''You & Me''. The lyrics of the Norwegian song "Tanta til Beate" by [[Lillebj<U+00F8>rn Nilsen]] mentions Reinhardt several times.

He is mentioned in [[Jump Little Children]]'s song "Mexico": "I won't let you leave, not with all my Django, [[Emmylou Harris|Emmylou]] and [[Steve Earle|Steve]]".

In 2010 the French and Belgian Google homepages displayed a logo commemorating the centenary of his birthday on  [http://www.google.fr/logos/djangoreinhardt10.gif 23 January 2010.]

Reinhardt is loosely suggested as the main character in the music video for "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" by Brian Setzer.  {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The [[Django (web framework)|Django web framework]] is named after him.

==Influence==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2008}}
Many guitar players, and musicians, have expressed admiration for Django Reinhardt, or have cited him as a major influence.  These include British rock guitarists [[Jimmy Page]], [[Jeff Beck]], and [[Eric Clapton]], all three of whom are regularly listed by publications such as [[Rolling Stone]] or [[Guitar Player Magazine]] as being within the top 10 greatest or most influential guitar players (often with Reinhardt, himself).  Other notable guitar players influenced by Reinhardt, include [[Jimmy McCulloch]], classical guitarist [[Julian Bream]]; [[country music|country]] artist [[Chet Atkins]], who placed Reinhardt #1 on a list of the ten most influential guitarists of the 20th century (and himself fifth); [[Latin music|Latin]]rocker [[Carlos Santana]]; blues legend [[B.B. King]]; [[Pete Townsend]] of [[The Who]]; Australian acoustic guitar player [[Tommy Emmanuel]]; [[The Wiggles]]' [[Murray Cook]]; [[Pierre Bensusan]]; [[Phish]]'s [[Trey Anastasio]]; [[The Libertines]]' [[Carl Barat]], [[Shawn Lane]]; [[Hank Marvin]]; [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]; [[Derek Trucks]]; [[Mark Knopfler]]; [[Les Paul]]; [[Joe Pass]]; [[Peter Frampton]]; [[Denny Laine]];  [[Jon Larsen]]; [[Steve Howe (guitarist)|Steve Howe]]; [[Charlie Christian]]; [[Frank Vignola]]; [[Barney Kessel]]; [[George Benson]]; [[Wes Montgomery]]; [[Martin Taylor (guitarist)|Martin Taylor]]; [[Michael Angelo Batio]]; [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]]; [[Robert Fripp]]; [[Ren<U+00E9> Thomas]]; and [[Jeff Martin (Canadian musician)|Jeff Martin]]. [[Willie Nelson]] wore a Django Reinhardt T-shirt on tour in Europe in 2002, stating in an interview that he admired Django's music and ability. 

[[Jose Feliciano]] attributes his unique style, in part, to that Reinhardt. In 2009 he composed an album inspired by those musical influences and entitled it ''Djangoisms''. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The [[Grateful Dead]]'s [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Black Sabbath]]'s [[Tony Iommi]], both of whom lost fingers in (separate) accidents, were particularly inspired by Django's ability to become an accomplished guitar player/musician, despite the diminished use of his own permanently injured hand, following an accident.

Some musicians, inspired by Reinhardt, have paid tribute to him by invoking his name in their own work or personal life. [[Jimi Hendrix]] is said to have conceived of, or used, the name [[Band of Gypsys]] because of Reinhardt's music. Jazz trio [[The Lost Fingers]] named themselves after Reinhardt's injured fingers.

A number of musicians have even named their sons Django in honour of, or respect for, Reinhardt.  They include [[Dawelie Reinhardt]], [[David Crosby]], former [[Slade]] singer [[Noddy Holder]], [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], [[Richard Durrant]], as well as actors [[Nana Visitor]], [[Alexander Siddig]] and [[Raphael Sbarge]]. Jazz musician [[Django Bates]] and singer-songwriter [[Django Haskins]] were also named after him.

Songs written in Reinhardt's honour include "Django," an instrumental guitar piece by renowned blues-rock guitarist [[Joe Bonamassa]]. The piece was influenced by the violin introduction of "Vous et Moi" (Blues et Mineur 1942, Brussels) where Reinhardt himself played the violin. Vous et Moi (You and Me) became the title of Bonamassa's sixth album where the track first appeared in 2006.  Slightly longer live versions appear on ''[[LIVE...From Nowhere In Particular]]'' (2009), and in DVD from the 4 May concert at [[Royal Albert Hall]].  "Django," composed by [[John Lewis (pianist)|John Lewis]], which has become a jazz standard performed by musicians such as Miles Davis.  The [[Modern Jazz Quartet]] titled one of their albums [[Django (Modern Jazz Quartet album)|Django]] in honour of him. The [[Allman Brothers Band]] song "[[Jessica (Allman Brothers Band song)|Jessica]]" was written by [[Dickey Betts]] in tribute to Reinhardt &mdash; he wanted to write a song that could be played using only two fingers. This aspect of the artist's work also motivated [[Black Sabbath]] guitarist [[Tony Iommi]], who was inspired by Reinhardt to keep playing guitar after a factory accident that cost him two fingertips. Composer Jon Larsen has composed several crossover concerts featuring Django inspired music together with symphonic arrangements, most famous are "White Night Stories" (2002) and "Vertavo" (1996).

In 2005, Django Reinhardt ended on the 66th place in the election of ''The Greatest Belgian'' (''[[De Grootste Belg]]'') in [[Flanders]] and on the 76th place in the [[Walloon language|Walloon]] version of the same competition ''[[Le plus grand Belge]]''.
