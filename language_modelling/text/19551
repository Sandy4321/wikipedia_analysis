'''STRAT-X''', or '''Strategic-Experimental''', was a nine month long study conducted during 1966<U+2013>1967 that comprehensively investigated the future of the [[Nuclear weapons and the United States|U.S. nuclear deterrent force]]. At the time, the [[Soviet Union]] were making significant strides in [[nuclear weapons delivery]], and also constructing [[anti-ballistic missile]] defenses to protect strategic facilities. To address a potential technological gap between the two [[superpower]]s, then [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] entrusted the STRAT-X study to the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]], who compiled a twenty-volume report. The report looked into more than one hundred different weapon-basing ideas, before eventuating in the [[MGM-134 Midgetman]] and [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper]] [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s, the {{Sclass|Ohio|submarine}}s, and the [[Trident missile|Trident]] [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s, among others. STRAT-X has been acknowledged by independent journalists as greatly influencing the U.S. nuclear posture.

==Background==
In the mid-1960s, reports surfaced about the planned deployment of numerous powerful and highly-accurate Soviet [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs).<ref name=AFM.com>{{cite book |author=Grier, Peter |title=Air Force magazine |url=http://www.airforce-magazine.com/Pages/HomePage.aspx |format= |accessdate=24 February 2012 |type=magazine |edition= |series= |volume=93 |date= |year=2010 |month=January |origyear= |publisher=[[Air Force Association]] |location=Arlington, Virginia |oclc=5169825 |doi= |id=ISSN 0730-6784 |page= |pages= |chapter=STRAT-X |chapterurl=http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Documents/2010/January%202010/0110stratx.pdf }}</ref> Although the ICBM models were not discussed, one of the Soviet ICBMs that entered service shortly after these reports was the [[R-36 (missile)|R-36]], a family of missiles with powerful warheads capable of destroying [[Minuteman missile|Minuteman]] [[Missile launch facility|hardened silos]]. The R-36, some variants of which are still in service, was larger than the [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper]] missile, while its {{Convert|8.8|t|lb|adj=on}} [[throw weight]] is the greatest of any ICBM ever.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/icbm/r-36m.htm |title=R-36M / SS-18 SATAN |author= |date=29 July 2000 |work=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |publisher=FAS.org |accessdate=24 February 2012}}</ref> Were these ICBMs to be used operationally, they would have  posed a significant risk to U.S. ICBMs.{{#tag:ref|"First, increasingly numerous ICBMs posed a threat to America's own weapons."<ref name=AFM.com/>|group="N"|name="N"}}

At the same time, the Soviets were designing and constructing increasingly sophisticated [[anti-ballistic missile]] defence systems to protect strategically-important facilities, as well as cities, greatly mitigating the threat posed by U.S. ICBMs and thus the concept of [[nuclear deterrence]].<ref name=AFM.com/> These developments compelled the then [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] to commission a [[Research|study]] to look into ways of maximizing the [[Nuclear weapons and the United States|U.S. nuclear arsenal]] that could survive a Soviet [[preemptive strike]].<ref name=AFM.com/>

==Study==
The study was named "STRAT-X" in order not to reveal its intentions, and also to eliminate partiality towards [[Nuclear triad|sea-, air- or land-based systems]]. It was conducted by the Research and Engineering Support Division of the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] (IDA), which had conducted a study in early 1966 titled "Pen-X", upon which STRAT-X was based.<ref name=FAS_ULMS>{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/slbm/ssbn_ulms.htm |title=ULMS |author= |date=30 May 1997 |work=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |publisher=FAS.org |accessdate=24 February 2012}}</ref> STRAT-X was chaired by President of the IDA, General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]], while Fred Payne preside over its "working" panel. The panel also included executives from major independent corporations and [[Defense contractor|defence contractors]] such as [[Boeing]], [[Booz Allen Hamilton]], [[Thiokol]] and [[TRW]].<ref name=AFM.com/> The Advisory Committee were mostly [[military officer]]s, including George H. Miller and Levering Smith.<ref name=FAS_ULMS/>

On 1 November 1966, McNamara signed an order authorizing STRAT-X, officially initiating the study. During STRAT-X, the working panel was "encouraged to examine system concepts unrestrained by considerations of potential management problems or political influences."<ref name=AFM.com/> The Secretary wanted new ideas about "path-breaking" weapons systems, either offensive or [[Self-defense|defensive]], without defense bureaucracy.<ref name=AFM.com/> [[Submarine launched ballistic missile|Sea-]], land- and air-based missile systems were investigated except for [[Strategic bomber|manned bombers]] and orbital systems. Also, the group were asked to consider the cost effectiveness of all systems uniformly, as well to predict possible [[Brinkmanship (Cold War)|Soviet responses]]. The latter was particularly interesting, as documents were written from the perspective of the [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Soviet Minister of Defense]] General [[Andrei Grechko]], complete with the [[Anti-capitalism|disapproval of capitalism]] and a mention of the eventual triumph of [[socialism]].<ref name=AFM.com/><ref name=WP.com/> In the end, a twenty-volume report covered no less than 125 different weapon-basing ideas, nine of which were reviewed in great detail.<ref name=AFM.com/><ref name=FAS_ULMS/><ref name=WP.com>{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.wordpress.com/2010/01/06/the-strat-x-report-and-its-impact/ |title=The STRAT-X Report and Its Impact |author=Burr, William |date=6 January 2010 |work=[[National Security Archive]] |publisher= |accessdate=24 February 2012}}</ref>

===Findings and consequences===
[[File:Small ICBM Hard Mobile Launcher USAF.jpg|thumb|A Hard Mobile Launcher that was designed to carry the [[MGM-134 Midgetman]] missile.<ref name=AFM.com/>|alt=Long vehicle in green black and dirt brown camouflage executing a turn on light-colored paved road for camera.]]

Of the nine prospective weapons-basing systems, five were land-based. These were: "Rock Silo"<U+2014>a system, where missiles would be stored in hardened silos in [[granite]] [[bedrock]] in [[Western United States|Western]] and [[Northern U.S.]]; "Soft Silo"<U+2014>a similar system but with easily- and cheaply-constructed silos; "Rock Tunnel"<U+2014>a system where missiles would be transported around in deep underground networks before emerging at launch points; "Soft Tunnel"<U+2014>a similar tunnel but built more cheaply and easily; and "Land Mobile"<U+2014>a [[Transporter erector launcher|truck-based system]] where road-transporters traveled at speeds up to {{Convert|35|mph|km/h}} constantly around a dedicated and winding road system in {{Convert|65,000|sqmi|km2}} of public land.<ref name=AFM.com/>

Of the remaining four, three were sea-based. These were: "Canal-Based"<U+2014>a systems where missiles would be sailed in [[canal]]s to confuse Soviet [[Military operation plan|military planners]]; "Ship-Based"<U+2014>a system where ships carrying missile cannisters would travel around the world, hiding among other traffic; and "Submarine-Based"<U+2014>a system where [[ballistic missile submarine]]s would roam the ocean while carrying missile cannisters outside their [[pressure hull]]s.<ref name=AFM.com/> The single air-based based consideration was the "Air Launched ICBM", which required large aircraft carrying [[Standoff (missile)|standoff ballistic missiles]] to launch their payloads at the Soviet Union.<ref name=AFM.com/>

Despite the numerous options investigated during this successful study, not one of these were, in the end, fully implemented, partly as a result of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. The STRAT-X "Land Mobile" option, however, resulted in the the [[MGM-134 Midgetman]] and [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper]] missiles. Nevertheless, the former was only a prototype, while 50 out of the original 100 of the latter were fielded (the Peacekeeper had since been retired).<ref name=AFM.com/> In October 1974, the [[United States Air Force]] successfully conducted an air-launch of a Minuteman missile from a [[C-5 Galaxy]], demonstrating the credibility of the "Air Launch ICBM" option of STRAT-X.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/information/heritage/milestones.asp?dec=1970-1980&sd=01/01/1970&ed=12/31/1989 |title=History Milestones

However, the ''Ohio'' class carries its missiles ''inside'' its hull, as opposed to ''outside'' as in STRAT-X reports.<ref name=AFM.com/> The two sea-based systems were in service, as of 2011.<ref name=FBMS>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_display.asp?cid=4100&tid=200&ct=4 |title=Fleet Ballistic Missile Submarines <U+2013> SSBN |author= |date=10 November 2011 |work=Navy.mil |publisher=U.S. Navy |accessdate=24 February 2012}}</ref>

==Legacy==
STRAT-X has far-reaching effects on the development and deployment of U.S. nuclear forces. In a 2002 report by the [[RAND Corporation]], STRAT-X was described as "one of the most influential analyses ever conducted" for the [[U.S. Department of Defense]].<ref name=AFM.com/> Journalist Peter Grier, in his [[Air Force Magazine|''Air Force'' magazine]] article "STRAT-X" described the study as "a wide-ranging look at the future of U.S. weapons that shaped the [[nuclear triad]] for decades, and remains a model for such efforts today".<ref name=AFM.com/><ref name=WP.com/>
