'''New York State Route 61''' is a [[state highway]] located almost entirely in the city of [[Niagara Falls]] in [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]], [[New York]]. The road runs across Niagara Falls in a northwest-southeast direction, terminating at [[New York State Route 384|NY 384]] at its southern extent and [[New York State Route 104|NY 104]] at its northern tip. The NY 61 designation was assigned in 1962.

Conceptually, the road, known as ''Hyde Park Boulevard'', forms the eastern border of downtown Niagara Falls. It is the second-shortest two-digit route in New York after [[New York State Route 71|NY 71]] in [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]].

==Route description==
NY 61 begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 384|NY 384]] (Buffalo Avenue) on the industrial banks of the [[Niagara River]] in eastern [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]]. The route, named ''Hyde Park Boulevard'' for its entire length, heads north initially as an undivided four-lane highway; however, after two blocks, the roadway widens to include a center turn lane. NY 61 continues onward through the densely populated neighborhoods of Niagara Falls to Packard Road, where the route begins to parallel Gill Creek, a small stream leading south to the Niagara River. After five blocks, NY 61 meets Ferry Avenue, a one-way street carrying southbound [[U.S. Route 62 (New York)|U.S. Route 62]], in the shadow of the Niagara Falls Courthouse. NY 61 meets northbound US 62 three blocks later at Walnut Avenue. At the intersection, Gill Creek passes under both US 62 northbound and NY 61 as it switches to the east side of Hyde Park Boulevard.<ref name=google>{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&ie=UTF8&t=h&ll=43.106623,-79.023457&spn=0.089484,0.22934&z=13 |accessdate=2008-03-14}}</ref>

The pairing of Gill Creek and NY 61 lasts for one more block before separating ahead of Pine Avenue,<ref name=google /> once known as [[New York State Route 62A|NY 62A]]<ref>{{cite map |url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=p6 |title=Niagara Falls Quadrangle - New York |year=1996 |publisher=[[New York State Department of Transportation]] |accessdate=2008-03-14}}</ref> but now designated as [[U.S. Route 62 Business (Niagara Falls, New York)|U.S. Route 62 Business]].<ref>{{cite map |publisher=[[American Map]] |title=Road Atlas - United States, Canada, Mexico |year=2008 |page=76 |isbn=0-8416-2837-8}}</ref> The intersection between Pine and Hyde Park Boulevard marks the southwestern limits of Hyde Park, one of the largest parks in the vicinity of the city. For the next dozen blocks, NY 61 acts as the divider between the residential neighborhoods of downtown Niagara Falls and the open spaces of Hyde Park, passing [[Sal Maglie Stadium]] as it heads north. At Linwood Avenue, the homes return to both sides of NY 61 as it approaches Porter Road, here carrying [[New York State Route 182|NY 182]]. While Porter Road ends here, NY 182 turns north, joining NY 61 for two blocks to Ontario Avenue, where it turns west toward the [[Whirlpool Rapids Bridge]].<ref name=google />

North of Ontario Avenue, the buildings surrounding NY 61 become more commercial and industrial in nature as it approaches the [[CSX Transportation]] Niagara [[classification yard|Yard]]. The route crosses over the western end of the yard before intersecting Lockport Road. The Niagara Falls [[Amtrak]] station, which Hyde Park Boulevard passes by but provides no access to it, is located just off Lockport Road on 27th Street.<ref name=google />

Away from the yard, the surroundings become residential once more for another four blocks before entering a heavily industrial neighborhood around an intersection with [[New York State Route 31|NY 31]]. Farther north in [[Lewiston (town), New York|Lewiston]], the center turn lane becomes a hard median as it widens in preparation for a pseudo-interchange with Highland Avenue. The median reverts back to its previous width shortly after Highland merges into Hyde Park Boulevard; however, the median ends two blocks later at a service road for the [[Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant]]. NY 61, now a four-lane undivided highway once again, continues for another {{convert|0.25|mi|km}} to the top of the Niagara River gorge, where it ends at [[New York State Route 104|NY 104]] south of the Moses Power Plant and adjacent to the campus of [[Niagara University]].<ref name=google />
