'''Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts''' [[Cross of Liberty (Estonia)|VR]] I/1 and III/1 (23 February 1874 &ndash; 18 January 1956) was the most influential [[politician]] of [[Interwar period|interwar]] [[Estonia]]. He had an important role in gaining independence from the [[Russian Empire]] in 1918 and organizing Estonian troops for the [[Estonian War of Independence|War of Independence]]. During the [[History of Estonia#Republic of Estonia|1920s and early 1930s]], P<U+00E4>ts led the most right-wing party of the major political parties of the time. In 1934, he organized a coup d'etat and created [[Era of Silence|an authoritarian regime]], which resulted in adopting a new constitution in 1938, after which he became the first [[President of Estonia]]. During his presidency, the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Soviet Union occupied Estonia]] in 1940, P<U+00E4>ts was arrested and deported to Russia, where he died in 1956.

==Early life==
Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts was born on 23 February 1874 in [[Tahkuranna Parish]], [[P<U+00E4>rnu County]], [[Estonia]], then part of the [[Governorate of Livonia]] of the [[Russian Empire]]. According to locals, Konstantin was born in a barn of a roadside farm, since his mother couldn't reach a doctor.<ref name="hot.ee">[http://www.hot.ee/vabadussoda/pats.htm Eesti esimene president Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts]</ref> 

The father of Konstantin, Jakob (Jaagup) P<U+00E4>ts, was a housebuilder from [[Heimtali]], [[Viljandi County]], but was forced to move after getting into conflict with local nobility. His mother, Olga Tumanova, was from a mixed Estonian-Russian family and therefore P<U+00E4>ts's father converted from [[Lutheranism]] to [[Orthodox Christianity]]. Konstantin, his older brother, two younger brothers and his younger sister were all brought up in strong Orthodox traditions. 

Konstantin started his education in the Orthodox parish school of [[Tahkuranna]].<ref name="hot.ee"/> After one year, the family moved to [[Raek<U+00FC>la (P<U+00E4>rnu)|Raek<U+00FC>la]] borough near [[P<U+00E4>rnu]], where Konstantin started attending the [[Russian language]] Orthodox parish school. Later he attended the clerical seminar in [[Riga]], but after deciding not to become a priest, he left for the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in P<U+00E4>rnu.<ref name="Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts - president.ee">[http://www.president.ee/et/eesti-vabariik/eesti-riigipead/4148/layout-headofstate.html Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts - president.ee]</ref>

From 1894 to 1898 he attended the Faculty of Law of [[Tartu University]], that he graduated as [[Candidate of Law|cand. jur.]] After graduation, P<U+00E4>ts served in the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian]] 96th Infantry Regiment of Omsk in [[Pskov]] and was promoted an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]].<ref name="Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts - president.ee"/> After rejecting an academic career in Tartu, he moved to [[Tallinn]] in 1900, to start a political career.

==Career==
===Journalism===
In Tallinn, Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts started his career as an assistant at the advocacy of [[Jaan Poska]]. In [[Tartu]], [[Jaan T<U+00F5>nisson]] had already founded his national newspaper ''[[Postimees]]'' in 1891, P<U+00E4>ts was planning to found his own in Tallinn. The first inspiration came from writers [[Eduard Vilde]] and [[Anton Hansen Tammsaare]], who couldn't get a licence from the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)#Russian Empire|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] because of their [[social democracy|social democratic]] views. Instead they used P<U+00E4>ts as an unknown lawyer with an affiliation in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]].<ref name="Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus p. 27">''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 27</ref>

P<U+00E4>ts was considered by the authorities to establish a newspaper that was loyal to the Empire and would "unite all Orthodox Estonians", however in reality his newspaper had a radical political content. The first issue of the ''[[Teataja]]'' ("The Publisher") came out on {{OldStyleDate|23 October|1901|10 October}}, starting a rivalry not only between ''Postimees'' and ''Teataja'', but also between Jaan T<U+00F5>nisson and Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts for the leading national figures. Instead of the ideological and nationalist ''Postimees'', ''Teataja'' emphasized the importance of economic activity. The work was made difficult by strong government censorship.<ref name="Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus p. 27"/>

===Early political career===
P<U+00E4>ts's first political goal was to take power in the towns, where [[Baltic Germans]] still controlled the municipal governments. P<U+00E4>ts served as a municipal adviser in Tallinn from 1904<ref name="Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts - president.ee"/> and together with Jaan Poska, he organized an electoral block between Estonians and liberal Russians, that managed to win at the 1904 Tallinn municipal elections. P<U+00E4>ts became a member of the city council and in April 1905, he became the deputy mayor, meaning he headed the city council.<ref name="hot.ee"/> His active work at the town government left him little time for his newspaper. A group of revolutionaries, led by [[Hans P<U+00F6><U+00F6>gelmann]], had taken control in ''Teataja'''s staff and published anti-government articles and called people for a revolution.<ref name="Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus p. 27"/>

During the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|1905 Revolution]], P<U+00E4>ts was already an activist on self-government reform, where he supported [[national autonomy]] in the [[Baltic governorates]].<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 54</ref> In the escalation of the revolution, his newspaper was closed and its staff members arrested. P<U+00E4>ts found out about this in advance and managed to escape to [[Switzerland]], only to find out that he had been condemned to death in Russia.<ref name="hot.ee"/> 

In 1906 he moved to [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], where he continued his literary and journalist career. Much of his work on was published anonymously in Estonia. He also advised local municipalities on land reform questions. P<U+00E4>ts later moved to [[Solnechnoye, Saint Petersburg|Ollila]], which was located at the Russian border near [[Saint Petersburg]]. There he became one of the editors for the Estonian newspaper ''Peterburi Teataja'' ("The Publisher of Saint Petersburg") in 1908, although he resided still in Finland. In Ollila, he was reunited with his family, with whom he had parted when he escaped to Switzerland in 1905.<ref name="hot.ee"/> 

After his wife had gotten seriously ill, P<U+00E4>ts found out that he was no longer condemned to death in Russia. He moved back to Estonia, to face only minor charges. From February 1910, he served time in [[Kresty Prison]] in Saint Petersburg, while his wife died of [[tuberculosis]] in Switzerland, where P<U+00E4>ts had sent her for treatment. During his imprisonment, he was able to study foreign languages and write articles, to be published in newspapers.<ref name="hot.ee"/>  P<U+00E4>ts was released in March 1911. The governor of the [[Governorate of Estonia]] complained about P<U+00E4>ts<U+2019>s activity in Estonia in 1905 and pleaded for the government not to let him return<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 95</ref> and he was banned from living in the Governorates of Estonia and [[Governorate of Livonia|Livonia]] for six years. However, strong connections with Jaan Poska helped him return to Estonia, where he founded another newspaper, ''Tallinna Teataja'' ("The Publisher of Tallinn").<ref name="hot.ee"/> 

From February 1916, P<U+00E4>ts served as an officer in Tallinn and in July 1917, he was elected as Chairman of the Supreme Committee of the Estonian Military, where he actively worked to form Estonian units in the [[Imperial Russian Army|Imperial Army]]. During the war, he also organized the cooperation between Estonians and liberal [[Baltic German]] estate owners.<ref name="hot.ee"/>

===Autonomy and German Occupation===
[[File:Salvation Committee.jpg|thumb|left|Members of the [[Estonian Salvation Committee]] in 1918: Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts, [[J<U+00FC>ri Vilms]] and [[Konstantin Konik]].]]
[[File:Manifest Eestimaa rahvastele.jpg|thumb|left|Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts was one of the authors of the [[Estonian Declaration of Independence]].]]
In 1917, when [[German Empire|German]] forces were advancing on Estonia, P<U+00E4>ts was able to avoid the mobilization. Since the control after the [[February Revolution]] was in the hands of the [[Russian Provisional Government]], Estonians were pursuing for an autonomy within the Russian Empire. In local debates on whether to form one or two autonomous governorates in Estonia, Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts, who supported a single autonomous governorate, took yet another victory from Jaan T<U+00F5>nisson, who supported the division of the time with autonomies. After Estonian mass protests in Petrograd, the Provisional Government formed the [[autonomous Governorate of Estonia]] on {{OldStyleDate|12 April|1917|30 March}}.

The [[Estonian Provincial Assembly]] (Maap<U+00E4>ev) was elected, P<U+00E4>ts joined and became one of the leading figures of the Estonian Country People's Union, which took 13 of the 55 seats. Left- and right-wing politiciana gained an equal number of seats in the Provincial Assembly, which made it difficult to appoint a speaker for the assembly. [[Jaan T<U+00F5>nisson]] of the centre-right nominated the candidacy of Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts, who however lost with only one vote to the almost unknown Artur Vallner. At first, P<U+00E4>ts chose not to join any of the [[parliamentary group]]s, but eventually joined the most right-wing Democratic group.<ref>name="Meie parlament ja aeg">[http://www.nlib.ee/html/expo/p90/p90-0.html]</ref> P<U+00E4>ts replaced [[Jaan Raamot]] as Chairman of the Provincial Government on {{OldStyleDate|25 October|1917|12 October}}.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 158</ref> During the [[October Revolution]], Bolsheviks took control in Estonia and the Provincial Assembly was disbanded. After failing to give over official documents, P<U+00E4>ts was arrested three times, until he finally went underground.<ref name="hot.ee"/> 

Since Bolshevik power in Estonia was relatively weak, the Council of Elders of the Maap<U+00E4>ev declared on {{OldStyleDate|28 November|1917|15 November}}, that the assembly was the only legally elected and constituted authority in Estonia. Since even the Council of Elders was too big to work underground, the three-membered [[Estonian Salvation Committee]] was formed on 19 February 1918 and Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts became one of its members.

German forces advancing Tallinn and [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]n forces evacuating, the Salvation Committee used the ''[[interregnum]]'' and issued the [[Estonian Declaration of Independence]] on 24 February 1918. Instantly the [[Estonian Provisional Government]] was formed and Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts became the [[Prime Minister of Estonia|Chairman of the Council of Ministers]] and Minister of Internal Affairs.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 168</ref>

On 25 February 1918, German forces captured Tallinn and arrested Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts on 16 June 1918. He was sent to several prison camps in [[Latvia]] until he finally placed in a camp in [[Grodno]], [[Poland]].<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 175</ref> He was released at the end of the war on 17 November 1918.

After the Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers [[J<U+00FC>ri Vilms]] mysteriously died in Finland, Jaan Poska led the underground republic. After Germany surrendered, Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts's 2nd cabinet of the Provisional Government took office on 12 November 1918, making P<U+00E4>ts the Prime Minister of the Provisional Government and the Minister of Internal Affairs.

After P<U+00E4>ts arrived to Tallinn and the Maap<U+00E4>ev had gathered, P<U+00E4>ts's 3rd cabinet of the Provisional Government was formed on 27 November 1918, with P<U+00E4>ts as Prime Minister of the Provisional Government and the Minister of War, leaving it up to him to organize national defence.

===War of Independence===
[[File:Tallinn24Feb1918.jpg|thumb|right|Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts gave the first traditional speech at the [[Independence Day]] parade on 24 February 1919.]]
[[File:EstConstAssmb.jpg|thumb|right|Weak representation in the left-wing dominated [[Estonian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] left Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts with little power in composing the land reform law and the [[Constitution of Estonia|1920 constitution]].]]
P<U+00E4>ts founded the [[Estonian Defence League]] to provide defence for the advancing [[Red Army]]. On 28 November 1918, Soviet Russian forces captured [[Narva]], which resulted the [[Estonian War of Independence]]. During a government meeting, Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts banged his fist on the table and refused to compromise with the Communists. This persuaded other government members to start a war against Soviet Russia. In January 1919, Estonians forced the Bolsheviks to retreat and by 24 February 1919, entire Estonian territory was under the control of the Provisional Government. In his speech at the 1919 Independence Day parade, he said: "We have to secure our economy so we could become less dependent from our allies. In order to avoid bankrupcy, we have to found our state on agriculture".<ref name="hot.ee"/> This became the basis for the [[Economy of Estonia|Estonian economy]] for the next 20 years.

In April 1919, the [[Estonian Constituent Assembly]] was elected, but the Estonian Country People's Union achieved only 8 of the 120 seats, leaving the majority to centre-left wing parties. On 8 May 1919, [[Otto Strandman|Otto August Strandman]] took over as the first Prime Minister. In the summer of 1919, P<U+00E4>ts opposed going into war with the Baltic German ''[[Baltische Landeswehr|Landeswehr]]'', but as he was in opposition, the government decided to start the [[Estonian War of Independence#Course of the war#Landeswehr war|Landeswehr War]], which ended in Estonian-Latvian victory. After the war had ended on 2 February 1920, the majority left wing Constituent Assembly adopted the radical land reform law and the [[Constitution of Estonia#History#First Constitution (1920<U+2013>1933)|first constitution]], which brought upon a very proportional parliament, short government cabinets and no separate and stable head of state.

===Democratic republic===
In September 1918, P<U+00E4>ts formed a new political party, the agrarian-conservative Farmers' Assemblies. In [[Estonian parliamentary election, 1920|1920 elections]], the party won 21 seats in the 100-member [[Riigikogu]] and from 25 January 1921 to 21 November 1922, Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts was the [[State Elder]] and led the first constitutional government cabinet. It was a centre-right coalition with three centrist parties. The cabinet fell soon after the centre-left Estonian Labour Party criticized P<U+00E4>ts's right-wing politics and left the coalition. After stepping down as head of government, P<U+00E4>ts served as [[Riigikogu#Speakers of the Riigikogu|President (speaker) of the Riigikogu]] from 20 November 1922 to 7 June 1923.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 246</ref>

In [[Estonian parliamentary election, 1923|1923 elections]], Farmers' Assemblies took 23 seats. On 2 August 1923, P<U+00E4>ts became State Elder for the second time. A similar centre-right coalition with three centrist parties lasted again until the Estonian Labour Party left the coalition, forcing P<U+00E4>ts to step down on 26 March 1924. From 15 December 1925 to 9 December 1927, [[Jaan Teemant]] of the Farmers' Assemblies was the State Elder.

In [[Estonian parliamentary election, 1926|1926 elections]], Farmers' Assemblies took again 23 seats and Jaan Teemant continued as State Elder. Already in 1927, P<U+00E4>ts criticized members of the parliament, saying that they have been causing the instability of government coalitions, rather than ideological differences.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 298</ref>  At the 6th Congress of Farmers' Assemblies in 1929, the party was in opposition to [[August Rei]]'s leftist government and P<U+00E4>ts, among others, demanded changes in the constitution, a smaller parliament, a separate presidential office and fight against corruption.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 319</ref> 

In [[Estonian parliamentary election, 1929|1929 elections]], Farmers' Assemblies took 24 seats and P<U+00E4>ts served his third term as State Elder from 12 February 1931 to 19 February 1932. It was an ideologically wide coalition with the Estonian Socialist Workers' Party and the centre-right Estonian People's Party. On 26 January 1932, Farmers' Assemblies and the left wing-agrarian Settlers' party joined their groups in Riigikogu, only to be followed by the formation of the National Centrist Party by four centrist parties in Riigikogu. P<U+00E4>ts's cabinet resigned, making Jaan Teemant the new State Elder.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 354</ref>

In [[Estonian parliamentary election, 1932|1932 elections]] the newly formed United Farmers' Party took 42 seats in Riigikogu and one of the party's leaders, [[Karl August Einbund]], became the State Elder. On 3 October 1932, the coalition between the United Farmers Party and National Centre Party broke up since the latter wanted to [[devaluation|devalue]] the [[Estonian kroon]] during the [[Great Depression]]. A month-long government crisis started. Since there were only three major parties in the parliament, the third being the Estonian Socialist Workers' Party, no functioning coalition could be found until special authority was given to Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts to form a [[grand coalition]] between all three major parties. His cabinet took office on 1 November 1932. On 25 November 1932, P<U+00E4>ts's government got even more power from the disunited parliament to deal with the economic crisis. His government cabinet was forced to resign on 18 May 1933, after the National Centre Party, still favouring devaluation, left the coalition and the United Peasants' Party had lost many of its members to the reactivated Settlers' party.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 364</ref>

Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts was relatively successful in internal politics. After adopting the constitution, his party was in all the government cabinets, except for [[Friedrich Karl Akel]]'s and August Rei's cabinets and Jaan T<U+00F5>nisson's fourth cabinet. This makes it 4,017 days (89%) in the government (of 4,497 between 1921<U+2013>1933). P<U+00E4>ts was himself the State Elder four times, a total of 1,476 days (33%). Interestingly, he never filled any other position in the government besides the head of government (except for the additional minister positions in the Provisional Government).

P<U+00E4>ts served as the chairman of the Farmers' Assemblies party only unofficially and he was considered to be a bad partyman and often formed the opposition within the party. Therefore he seldom took part of their official meetings. Only in 1933, he was made honorary chairman of the party.<ref>Laaman, Eduard; ''Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts. Poliitika- ja riigimees''; Noor-Eesti kirjastus, Tartu, 1940; p. 176</ref>

Lack of government stability led to several new constitution proposals, but only the third proposal by the right-wing populist [[Vaps Movement]] was accepted on a referendum in 1933. P<U+00E4>ts was elected on 21 October 1933 to head the non-aligned transitional government to the [[Constitution of Estonia#History#Second Constitution (1934<U+2013>1938)|second constitution]]. Until 24 January 1934, he served as State Elder, but after the new constitution came into force, he became Prime Minister in duties of the State Elder. The new constitution was a drift from democracy, giving a lot of power to the president (still named "State Elder").<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 380</ref> On 27 February 1934, P<U+00E4>ts imposed a law, prohibiting members of the military to take part in politics. This action forced several thousand members of the army to secede from the Vaps Movement.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 381</ref> P<U+00E4>ts was one of the candidates in the presidential elections,<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 382</ref> but he was accompanied by threats by the Vaps Movement to take power and rumors of a forthcoming coup. Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts then carried out a ''coup d'<U+00E9>tat'' on 12 March 1934. He was supported by general [[Johan Laidoner]] and the army.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 383</ref>

===Era of Silence===
[[File:Oruloss.JPG|thumb|right|Oru palace in [[Toila]] was used as the summer residence of P<U+00E4>ts during his authoritarian and presidential years. The palace was destroyed in [[World War II]].]]
[[File:Tallin-Estonian president site.jpg|thumb|left|The presidential palace in [[Kadriorg]] was finished during P<U+00E4>ts's presidency in 1938.]]
A state of emergency was declared and the [[Vaps Movement]] was disbanded, with about 400 members arrested, including the presidential candidate [[Andres Larka]]. Johan Laidoner was appointed Commander in Chief of the Armies. On 15<U+2013>16 March 1934, the parliament approved of P<U+00E4>ts's actions, hoping to save the democracy. P<U+00E4>ts postponed the presidential elections for "emotions being too high because of anti-government agitation by the Vaps Movement".<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 283</ref>

In August 1934, P<U+00E4>ts appointed [[Karl August Einbund]] as Minister of Internal Affairs, making him the third leading figure of the era next to P<U+00E4>ts and Laidoner. In September, the Agitation and Propaganda Department was created,<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 391</ref> in October, all parliamentary work was stopped after the opposition criticized the political restrictions<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 392</ref> and in December, censorship was introduced.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 394</ref> 

In February 1935 the Fatherland Union (''Isamaaliit'') was formed to replace political parties,<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 399</ref> while all other political organizations were disbanded in March. P<U+00E4>ts thought that political organizations should unite the society, not fragmentize it.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 401</ref> 

As P<U+00E4>ts believed that a nation should be organized not by political views into parties, but by vocation into respective chambers, a series of [[Corporate chambers (Estonia)|state corporative institutions]] were introduced, based on [[Corporatism#Fascist corporatism|corporatism in Fascist Italy]]. P<U+00E4>ts had promoted the idea of corporate chambers already in 1918, but the idea did not gain support from strong left-wing parties at the time. P<U+00E4>ts was main the proponent of the formation of the chambers and the first two were also founded while his government cabinets were in office in 1924 and 1931. Fifteen more chambers were established between 1934 and 1936, bringing the total number to 17.<ref>{{cite book|last=Karjah<U+00E4>rm|first=Toomas |year=2002|chapter=Konstantin P<U+00E4>tsi poliitilised ideed [Political ideas of Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts] |title=Konstantin P<U+00E4>tsi tegevusest : artiklite kogumik [On the work of Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts : collection of articles] |editor1-last=Arjakas |editor1-first=K<U+00FC>llo |editor2-last=Velliste |editor2-first=Anne |publisher=Museum of Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts |location=Tallinn |language=Estonian |url=http://www.konstantinpaetsimuuseum.ee/Konstantin_Patsi_tegevusest_artiklite_kogumik.doc |isbn=	9985783417}}</ref>

On 7 December 1935, a ''coup d'<U+00E9>tat'' attempt by the Vaps Movement was exposed. More than 750 people were arrested throughout the state, crushing the movement conclusively.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 410</ref> Leaders of the movement were eventually given punishments as hard as 20 years of forced labour,<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 416</ref> they were pardoned in December 1937.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 437</ref> 

Meanwhile, [[Jaan T<U+00F5>nisson]] had criticized P<U+00E4>ts's inability to bring the new constitution into effect. In July 1935, T<U+00F5>nisson was ousted from the ''[[Postimees]]'' board.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 405</ref> In October 1936, four former State Elders, [[Juhan Kukk]], [[Ants Piip]], [[Jaan Teemant]] and Jaan T<U+00F5>nisson, sent a joint letter to P<U+00E4>ts, demanding civil freedoms.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 421</ref>

During the authoritarian regime, it was easier for the government to pass reforms, since there was no longer an organized opposition. P<U+00E4>ts ruled mostly through presidential [[decree]]s, because the parliament was needed to pass real laws. The economy grew and the infrastructure, industry and education were developed. The [[Estonianization]] of personal names was supported, the most prominent example being Karl August Einbund, who changed his name to Kaarel Eenpalu.

Regarding the 1934 constitution too undemocratic, P<U+00E4>ts organised the passing of a new constitution through a plebiscite and a constituent assembly. The [[Corporate chambers (Estonia)|corporate chambers]] were to be the basis of forming the assembly.<ref name="HF">[http://books.google.com/books?id=9wHNrF7nFecC&dq  A History of Fascism, 1914-1945 By Stanley George Payne] ISBN 1857285956</ref> Its formation was approved (with 76% in favour) in a plebiscite in 1936. The 1936 National Assembly elections were boicotted by the opposition in most electoral districts.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 423</ref>

On 28 July 1937, the assembly adopted the [[Constitution of Estonia#History#Third Constitution (de facto 1938<U+2013>1940, de jure 1938<U+2013>1992)|third constitution]], that was based on P<U+00E4>ts's draft.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 432</ref> A bicameral parliament was to be elected and the president was to be elected by the parliament, not by the people. On 3 September 1937, a 120-day period of transition began, during which P<U+00E4>ts ruled as [[President-Regent]].<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 434</ref>

On 1 January 1938, the new constitution came into force and the [[Estonian parliamentary election, 1938|1938 parliamentary elections]] were held. Opposition candidates were allowed to take part, however they were given little or no attention in the media. P<U+00E4>ts's supporters took 64 of the 80 seats in the lower chamber, Riigivolikogu. The president, who was yet to be elected, was also able to directly appoint into office 10 of the 40 members of the higher chamber, Riigin<U+00F5>ukogu.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 440</ref> 

The parliament, together with municipal appointees elected Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts the first [[President of Estonia]]. No other candidates were nominated and P<U+00E4>ts was elected with 219 votes in favour and 19 ballots left empty.<ref name="hot.ee"/><ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 443</ref> He took office on 24 April 1938 and appointed Kaarel Eenpalu as Prime Minister on 9 May 1938. On 5 May 1938, all political prisoners, mostly Communists and members of the Vaps Movement, were given amnesty. There is no consensus, whether the so-called "[[Era of Silence]]" ended in 1938 with the adoption of the new constitution, or in 1940 with the Soviet occupation.

===Late republic and Soviet Occupation===

After the beginning of [[World War II]] Estonia declared its neutrality, but was compelled to sign the [[Soviet<U+2013>Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty]] on 28 September 1939 to allow Soviet [[military bases]] in Estonia. On 12 October 1939, P<U+00E4>ts appointed [[J<U+00FC>ri Uluots]] as a new, moderate Prime Minister.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 468-470</ref>

In May 1940, P<U+00E4>ts believed that the best option for Estonia would be to follow Soviet guidelines until the [[Operation Barbarossa|German-Soviet war]]. In case of such war, "Estonia would be saved".<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 483</ref> However on 16 June 1940, the Soviet Union delivered an ultimatum to the Estonian government, which was forced to accept it. Complete [[Occupation of the Baltic States|occupation by the Soviet Union]] followed on 17 June 1940. 

On 21 June 1940, P<U+00E4>ts was forced to assign the communist [[Johannes Vares]] as the new Prime Minister. For an entire month P<U+00E4>ts signed ca. 200 decrees for the new Soviet regime.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, II osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2004; p. 28</ref> Among other things, he gave the decree to change the electoral law, allowing the new regime to organize preliminary elections. Only the lower chamber of the Riigikogu, the Riigivolikogu, was convened, its members being only Communists. On [[Victory Day#June 23 in Estonia|Victory Day]] of 23 June 1940, P<U+00E4>ts declared, that "the greatest thing we have accomplished, is the creation of the Estonian state. To her we have given our strongest love, our loyalty, our work and our life." From 29 June 1940, P<U+00E4>ts remained under permanent house arrest.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, II osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2004; p. 15</ref> Even in early July, P<U+00E4>ts declared to the German ambassador, that he doesn't believe in the [[Sovietization]] of Estonia.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, II osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2004; p. 16</ref>

On 21 July 1940, [[Estonian SSR]] was proclaimed, P<U+00E4>ts was forced to leave the office and was deported to [[Leningrad]] with his family on 30 July 1940. After a few weeks, they were sent to [[Ufa]], where they lived in a small house for a year. On 26 June 1941, Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts was arrested, parted from his family and sent to a prison in [[Bashkir ASSR]].<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, II osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2004; p. 62</ref>

In 1952, P<U+00E4>ts was sent to forced treatment in [[Kazan]] prison hospital. His forced psychiatric hospitalization was justified by his "persistent claiming of being the President of Estonia". Forced treatment was ended in 1954 and P<U+00E4>ts was sent to a mental hospital in [[J<U+00E4>mejala]], Estonia. Recognition by the locals and too much attention resulted him being sent to Burashevo psychiatric hospital in [[Kalinin Oblast]] (now Tver Oblast), where he eventually died on 18 January 1956.

==Legacy==
{{ref improve section|date=March 2011}}
P<U+00E4>ts's ideology went through major changes during his career. During the [[1905 Revolution]], he was considered to be a socialist, as many of the progressive ideas were considered socialist at the time. During his exile years, he became more social liberal, trying to use the best of both ideologies. During independent Estonia, he acted as a conservative with even elements of [[statism]] during his authoritarian years.<ref>Adams, J<U+00FC>ri. ''Tundmatu Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts. // Eesti riik II.''; Ilmamaa, Tartu, 2001; p. 11, 13-14</ref>

Several aspects of P<U+00E4>ts's career are still under critical public debate. P<U+00E4>ts has been seen as a politician, who destroyed democracy in pre-war Estonia. According to some historians, he and his close allies used the 1934 coup for their own personal gains and not to keep the Vaps Movement from taking power. Several members of the P<U+00E4>ts family gained important positions in ranging from clerical to cultural fields.<ref>Turtola, Martti; ''President Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts''; T<U+00E4>nap<U+00E4>ev, 2003; p. 187</ref> Others have criticised the long time that took to adopt a new constitution (more than four years).

His actions before and during the Soviet occupation have been questioned even more. One of the more prominent critics has been [[Magnus Ilmj<U+00E4>rv]]. In 1918, P<U+00E4>ts refused to compromise with the Communists, but in 1940, he gave Estonia to Soviets without many objections. This controversy has led to theories, that P<U+00E4>ts's bad health didn't let him realistically analyze the situation.<ref name="Adams, J<U+00FC>ri p. 27-28">Adams, J<U+00FC>ri; ''Tundmatu Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts. // Eesti riik II''; Ilmamaa, Tartu, 2001; p. 27-28</ref>

Other theories maintain that P<U+00E4>ts trusted the Soviet officials and had befriended some of the Soviet leaders. It is also possible, that the [[NKVD]] controlled P<U+00E4>ts's health or the information that reached him. Another theory suggests, that P<U+00E4>ts knew of the outbreaking war between [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] and was only looking for a way for Estonia to survive the short period in between.<ref name="Adams, J<U+00FC>ri p. 27-28"/>

One more theory insists that P<U+00E4>ts knew of the difficulty of the situation and tried to keep Estonians as safe as possible by avoiding war with the Soviets. As a lawyer, he also had to understand that his decisions were not valid when forced by an occupying power.<ref name="Adams, J<U+00FC>ri p. 27-28"/> Under international law a war would have invalidated the [[Tartu Peace Treaty]].

According to international law and the Estonian constitution, P<U+00E4>ts's actions were of no affect from the beginning of the occupation, or at least from 21 June 1940, when [[Andrei Zhdanov]] dictated the formation of government cabinet led by Johannes Vares. The laws passed by the Vares government and promulgated by P<U+00E4>ts were illegal in any case as they were not ratified by the upper chamber as required by the Estonian constitution.

Legally, his duties went to the last Prime Minister J<U+00FC>ri Uluots, who let [[Otto Tief]] [[National Committee of the Republic of Estonia|form a government]] in 1944, before the Soviet reoccupation. After Uluots died in [[Stockholm]] in 1945, presidential duties went to the oldest member of Tief's cabinet, August Rei, who formed the [[Estonian Government in Exile]] in 1953. The last Prime Minister in duties of the President, [[Heinrich Mark]], handed over his credentials to the incoming President [[Lennart Georg Meri]] on 8 October 1992.

In 1918, P<U+00E4>ts made a proposal for an Estonian-Finnish [[personal union]]. However, Finnish leaders weren't so eager about the union and the idea was rejected.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 240</ref> P<U+00E4>ts still bore the idea in his mind, as testified by his so-called "political testament", written in July 1940. In 1922, during his first term as State Elder, he made the first Estonian [[state visit]], to Finland. He also made unofficial visits to Finland in 1931,<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 349</ref> 1935<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 406</ref> and 1937. [[President of Finland]], [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]] visited Estonia twice during P<U+00E4>ts's authoritarian rule, in 1934<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 389</ref> and in 1936.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 418</ref>

In 1933, P<U+00E4>ts also made a state visit to [[Latvia]]<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 378</ref> and the [[Baltic Entente]] between Estonia, Latvia and [[Lithuania]] was signed in 1934 during his authoritarian regime. This agreement was another attempt to draw Finland closer to Estonia, but saw no results.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 390</ref> During the 1930s, Estonian and Polish officials made several state visits to both countries. 

In late 1930s, the Soviet Union excited interest for the Baltic states, causing Estonia to move closer to Germany in its foreign policy. This change was marked by appointing the amassador to Germany, [[Friedrich Karl Akel]], as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Estonia)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] in 1936.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 417</ref> On 3 December 1938, Estonia declared its neutrality.<ref>''XX sajandi kroonika, I osa''; Eesti Ents<U+00FC>klopeediakirjastus, Tallinn, 2002; p. 453</ref>

==Remains==
In 1988, Estonians Henn Latt and Valdur Timusk decided to search for Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts's remains in Russia. They reached Burashevo village, 15&nbsp;km from Kalinin (now [[Tver]]), where P<U+00E4>ts had been a patient in the hospital. They met his last doctor, who described P<U+00E4>ts's funeral in 1956. On 22 June 1990, his grave was dug up and the remains were reburied to Tallinn Metsakalmistu cemetery on 21 October 1990.<ref>http://www.sakala.ajaleht.ee/?id=373818</ref><ref>http://www.videvik.ee/?id=1939</ref>

==Economic and cultural activities==
P<U+00E4>ts actively participated in economic activities. In periods between 1919 to 1933, he was chairman of the insurance company "Estonian Lloyd". From 1925 to 1929, P<U+00E4>ts was the chairman of the council of the [[Corporate chambers (Estonia)|Chamber of Commerce and Industry]] and continued as its honorary councillor from 1935. He also served as the chairman of the board of the Harju Bank and chairman of the Tallinn Exchange Committee. He ran a farm in [[Kloostrimetsa]], near Tallinn - a place which now functions as the [[Tallinn Botanic Garden]].<ref name="Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts - president.ee"/>

P<U+00E4>ts was the chairman of Estonian-Finnish-Hungarian Association from 1925 to 1936 and continued as honorary chairman from 1936. From 1927 to 1937, he was the chairman of the "Fenno-Ugria" foundation.<ref name="Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts - president.ee"/>

P<U+00E4>ts received honorary doctorates from Tartu University in 1928, [[Tallinn Technical University]] and [[Andhra University]] (in [[India]]) in 1938, along with honorary membership of the [[Learned Estonian Society]] in 1938 and the [[Estonian Academy of Sciences]] in 1939. In 1938, he became honorary member of the Estonian Naturalists' Society (''Loodusuurijate Selts'') and the Estonian Institute of Natural Resources (''Loodusvarade Instituut''). He was also named honorary alumnus of the fraternal [[corporation (university)#Estonia|student corporation]] [[Fraternitas Estica]] and honorary citizen of [[Tallinn]], [[Narva]], [[P<U+00E4>rnu]] and [[Tartu]] and [[Tahkuranna Parish]].<ref name="Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts - president.ee"/>

==Personal life==
[[File:Konstantin and Helma P<U+00E4>ts.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts and his wife Helma.]]
Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts married Helma (Vilhelmine) Peedi in 1901. They had two sons, Leo and Viktor. Konstantin left his family for exile in 1905 and his second son was born while he still resided in Switzerland. They were united when Konstantin moved to Ollila, Finland. His wife died of lung disease in 1910 while he was imprisoned in Saint Petersburg, P<U+00E4>ts never remarried. His children were raised by his wife's unmarried sister Johanna Pung.<ref name="hot.ee"/> 

P<U+00E4>ts was seen as a kind person, who was able to give good speeches, was grown in a rural area and therefore had a heart for the land. He took a special interest in issues related to children. He often donated money to large families and organized events for students, which he also took part of. He was also known to take long walks in the morning and to get into conversations with park workers.<ref name="hot.ee"/>

==Descendants==
Konstantin's eldest son, Leo P<U+00E4>ts, managed to escape to Finland in 1939. He eventually moved on to Sweden, where he died in 1988.<ref>http://kultuur.elu.ee/ke489_sugupuu.htm Sugupuu kui s<U+00FC><U+00FC>distuse alus</ref> Konstantin's second son, Viktor P<U+00E4>ts, died in a Siberian prison in 1952. He had two sons, Matti and Enn, but Enn died of starvation in an orphanage in 1944. All living descendants of Konstantin P<U+00E4>ts are the children and grandchildren of Matti P<U+00E4>ts, who returned from Siberia with his mother in 1946.<ref>http://www.kool.ee/?7828 Eesti esimene president</ref>
