'''Charlotte of Savoy''' (11 November 1441<ref>Charles Cawley, ''Medieval Lands, Savoy'', retrieved 1 May 2010</ref> <U+2013> 1 December 1483) was the second wife and only [[Queen consort]] of [[Louis XI of France]]. She had three surviving children, one of whom succeeded Louis as King [[Charles VIII of France]], with her eldest daughter, [[Anne of France]], acting as his [[regent]].

== Family ==

She was a daughter of [[Louis, Duke of Savoy]], and [[Anne of Cyprus]]. Her maternal grandparents were [[Janus of Cyprus]] and [[Charlotte de Bourbon-La Marche]]. Her maternal grandmother, for whom she was probably named, was a daughter of [[John I, Count of La Marche]], and [[Catherine de Vend<U+00F4>me]].

She was one of 19 children, 14 of whom survived infancy.

==Betrothal and marriage==
On 11 March 1443, when Charlotte was just over a year old, she was betrothed to Frederick of Saxony (28 August 1439- 23 December 1451), eldest son of [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony]].<ref>Cawley</ref> For reasons unknown, the betrothal was annulled. Less than eight years later on 14 February 1451, Charlotte married [[Louis XI of France|Louis, Dauphin France]] (future Louis XI), eldest son of [[Charles VII of France]] and [[Marie of Anjou]]. The bride was only nine years old and the groom twenty-seven. The marriage, which had taken place without the consent of the French king,<ref>Cawley</ref> was Louis' second; his first wife, [[Margaret Stewart (Dauphine of France)|Margaret of Scotland]], had died childless in 1445. Upon her marriage, Charlotte became Dauphine of France.

In spite of her virtues, Louis neglected her. For example, upon his succession to the throne of France, he immediately abandoned her in Burgundy - where the two had been in exile - to secure his inheritance, leaving the young Queen dependent upon the aid of [[Isabella of Bourbon]], wife of [[Charles I, Duke of Burgundy|Charles, Heir of Burgundy]]. A contemporary of Charlotte's noted that "while she was an excellent Princess in other respects, she was not a person in whom a man could take any great delight";<ref>Sharon L. Jansen, ''Anne of France: Lessons For My Daughter'', 2004, p.2, Google Books, retrieved on 1 May 2010</ref> She was, however, praised for the taste and excellence of her personal library.<ref>Jansen, p.3</ref>

On 22 July 1461, Charlotte became Queen consort of France. She held that position until her husband's death on 30 August 1483.

Charlotte gave her husband eight children; however, only three survived infancy; these were the future King [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]], and princesses  [[Anne of France]] (better known as Anne de Beaujeu), who would act as regent of the kingdom, and [[Joan of France, Duchess of Berry|Jeanne of France]], who later became the consort of [[Louis XII of France]].

After a solitary life, Charlotte died on 1 December 1483 in [[Amboise]], just a few months after her husband's death.
She is buried with him in the [[Notre-Dame de Cl<U+00E9>ry Basilica]] [http://www.clery-saint-andre.com/basilique.html] in [[Cl<U+00E9>ry-Saint-Andr<U+00E9>]] ([[Loiret]]) in the [[arrondissement of Orl<U+00E9>ans]].
