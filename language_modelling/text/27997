==Synopsis==
Ever since he defeated Ye Zhong, Yan Fei had decided to bow out of the gambling scene. However, things were not as peaceful as he had hoped. His wife, Luo Qifang, got embroiled in a mysterious case of casino murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. 

Eight years have passed and Yan Fei has become the most philanthropic gambler king on Coral Island. His generous deeds greatly move the authorities that they decide to release Qifang on a reduced sentence. Just then, illusionary gambler Luo Shenfeng challenges Yan Fei to give up his monopoly of the gambling business. Yan Fei refuses and thus gets into several rounds of tussles with Shenfeng. 

Yan Fei<U+2019>s grown-up son, Yan Xing, is finally back from abroad. The latter dreams of being a reigning gambling king just like his father. To his great disappointment, his father forbids it and refuses to pass on any of his skills to him for fear that he<U+2019>ll get enmeshed into the whirlpool of the gambling scene. 

Instead, Yan Fei chooses to impart his skills to his 3 disciples, Wu Youkang, Dong Meiyao and Ding Wei, in the hope that 1 of them can take over his gambling empire. But because of this decision, Yan Fei creates a rift in his relationship with his son. The rebellious junior decides to go against his wish and makes a bid for the coveted throne as well. 

Antagonist Huang Yunjiu, changes his looks and poses as a professional gambler so he can rid Qifang to avenge his wife<U+2019>s death. He first befriends Luo Shenfeng to join forces against Yan Fei. Later, he schemes to ensnare the gullible Yan Xing into his plot of revenge by baiting him with the promise of the gambling king<U+2019>s throne. 

Yan Xing succumbs to temptations and acknowledges Yunjiu as his mentor. He turns his back on his parents, breaking their hearts. Huang Yunjiu sends assassins after Qifang but a nurse, Jiang Yexue, saves her. Yexue was once forced into an immoral deal with Luo Shenfeng when she tried to pay off her brother<U+2019>s gambling debts. Luckily for her, Yan Fei appeared and helped her out of it. Since then, she begins to develop feelings for him. 

One of Yan Fei<U+2019>s disciple, Dong Meiyao, turns out to be Yunjiu<U+2019>s daughter. She is forced by her father to betray Yan Fei, thus causing the latter to lose his memory. Yan Xing makes use of this opportunity to force his mother back to the gambling arena. With no one to turn to, Qifang is at a loss. The discovery of her amnesic husband<U+2019>s amorous relationship with Jiang Yexue adds to her sorrows.

Yan Fei finally regains his memory. When he finds out his son had forced his mother into a life and death gamble, he decides to take his wife<U+2019>s place, hoping that he can bring back Yan Xing<U+2019>s conscience.

Who will emerge the ultimate winner?
