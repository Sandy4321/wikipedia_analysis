'''Humayun Azad''' ([[Bangla]]: <U+09B9><U+09C1><U+09AE><U+09BE><U+09AF><U+09BC><U+09C1><U+09A8> <U+0986><U+099C><U+09BE><U+09A6>) (Rarhi Khal, [[Dhaka]] [[Bangladesh]], [[28 April]], [[1947]] - [[Munich]], [[Germany]], [[11 August]], [[2004]]) was a prolific [[Bengali language|Bangladeshi]] [[author]] and [[scholar]]. He wrote more than seventy titles. He was widely known for his anti-establishment, anti-religion and  anti-military voice and was reputed for caustic remarks.

== Professional and literary life ==
After graduating from the [[University of Dhaka]] in ''[[Bengali language]] and Literature'', Humayun Azad, in 1976, obtained his PhD in [[linguistics]] from the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He later served as  a teacher of [[Bangla|Bengali]] Language and literature at the [[University of Dhaka]] and in his early career produced pioneering works on Bangla linguistics, notably [[Bangla|Bengali]] [[syntax]]. He was regarded as a leading linguist of the one-thousand-year-old Bangla (Bengali) language. 

Towards the end of 1980s he started to write newspaper column focusing on contemporary socio-political issues. His commentaries continued throughout the 1990s and were later published as books as they grew in numbers. Through his writings of 1990s, he established himself as a freethinker and appeared to be an [[atheist]]. He fearlessly and openly criticized in his works [[religious extremism]], including [[Islam]], the major religion in Bangladesh. 

Professor Humayun Azad published the first comprehensive feminist book in [[Bangla|Bengali]] on the subject of women titled ''Naari'' (Bangla for 'Woman') in 1992. Largely akin to [[The Second Sex]] by [[Simone de Beauvoir]] in contents and ideas, ''Naari'' became a best-seller and earned Humayun Azad popularity as an author. In this work Humayun Azad painstakingly compiled the feminist ideas of the West that underlie the feminist contributions of the subcontinent's socio-political reformers and drew attention to the anti-women attitude of some legendary [[Bengali writers]] including [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. The work, critical of the patriarchal and male-chauvinistic attitude of religions towards women, attracted negative reaction from conservative censors. The [[Government of Bangladesh]] banned the book in [[1995]]. The ban was eventually lifted in [[2000]], following a legal battle that Humayun Azad won in the High Court of the country.

== Assassination attempt ==
On [[February 27]], [[2004]], he became the victim of a vicious [[assassination]] attempt by unidentified assailants near the campus of the [[University of Dhaka]]. An [[Islamist]] group named Jamayatul Mujahedin Bangladesh had taken the responsibility of the incident. But this has not yet been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. As he was returning to his Fuller Road residence from the yearly book fair held at the [[Bangla Academy]] premises, the assailants stopped him on the road and hacked at his neck and face with machetes, cracking bombs to disperse the crowd who tried to rescue him. He subsequently fell into a coma for four days, but eventually survived after receiving intensive treatment at the Combined Military Hospital in [[Dhaka]]. He was then taken to Bumrungrad hospital in [[Bangkok]] for further treatment of his critically damaged face. The incident created a huge backlash among the progressive liberals in the society and the public in general who were appalled at the lack of security that made this attack  on one of the most renowned scholars in the country possible. The students of the university were especially agitated at this heinous crime against their beloved teacher on their very own campus and marched in protest. 

The assassination attempt took place following the publication of his [[novel]] ''Pak Sar Jamin Saad Baad'', a story based on religious groups in Bangladesh who collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War|independence war]]. In it he tried to expose the attitudes and activities of the [[Islamist]]s, [[Pakistan]] sympathizers and the nationalists in Bangladesh. He created a scenario that vividly portrayed the [[fanatic]] and barbaric nature of these groups. Afterwards, Dr. Azad expressed that he had suffered severe mental trauma since the attack, but he also vowed to continue writing against the rise of Muslim militants in Bangladesh.

Muslim scholars in Bangladesh, on the other hand, condemned the assassination attempt but simultaneously claimed that the novel injured the sentiments of the majority. They demanded that the novel be banned and a [[blasphemy]] law be passed so that no such book could be published in the future, a reaction not too dissimilar to their treatment of his earlier ''Naari''.

=== Death ===
On [[August 11]], [[2004]], Professor Azad died in his apartment in [[Munich]], [[Germany]], where he had moved just a week prior to conducting research on the nineteenth century German romantic poet [[Heinrich Heine]]. His body was brought home and he was laid to eternal rest in Rarhikhal, his rural homeland.

== Literary Achievements ==
Literary career of Humayun Azad started with poetry. However, his poems did not show any notable poetic fervour. On the other hand his literary essays, particularly those based on original research, carried significant value. 

He earned reputation as a newspaper columnist towards the end of 1980s. These were merciless attacks on social and political injustice, hypocrisy and corruption. He was uncowed in protesting military rule. His collected his critical remarks in a book styled ''Humayun Azader Probochonguccho'' which is apparently an influence of Flaubert's ''Dictionary of Accepted Ideas'' .

Publication of ''Naari'', a feminist work on woman,  earned him general popularity and paved way for establishing himself in the literary world of Bangladesh. He started to write novels in 1990s which sold well. His writings show deep sense of hatred for politicians, military and the Islamists. In fiction he profusely used erotic themes which quickly appealed to the younger generation.  

Nevertheless, his prose shows a well-knit and compact style of his own. His formation of sentence, choice of words and syntax are very characteristic of him. Although he often fell victim to the temptation of using fiction as a vehicle of conspicuous political and philosophical message, he distinguished himself with his catachrestic style and diction.
