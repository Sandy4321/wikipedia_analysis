'''Colonialism''' is the building and maintaining of [[colony|colonies]] in one territory by people from another territory.<ref name="Colonialism">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/colonialism/ Colonialism]. ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.''</ref>  [[Sovereignty]] over the colony is claimed by the [[metropole]].  [[Social structure]], [[government]] and [[economics]] within the territory of the colony are changed by the colonists.

Colonialism normally refers to a period of history from the 15th to the 20th century when people from Europe built colonies on other continents.  The reasons for the practice of colonialism at this time include:
*The [[Profit (economics)|profits]] to be made.
*To expand the [[Power in international relations|power]] of the metropole.
*To escape [[persecution]] in the metropole.
*To [[Religious conversion|convert]] the indigenous population to the colonists' religion.

Some colonists also felt they were helping the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous population]] by bringing them [[Christianity]] and [[civilization]].  However, the reality was often subjugation, displacement or death.<ref name="Smallpox: Eradicating the Scourge">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/smallpox_01.shtml Smallpox: Eradicating the Scourge]. ''BBC - History.''</ref>

A colony is part of an empire and so colonialism is closely related to [[imperialism]].

==Types of colonialism==
Historians often distinguish between two forms of colonialism, chiefly based on the number of people from the colonising country who settle in the colony:
*[[Settler colonialism]] involved a large number of colonists, typically seeking fertile land to farm.
*[[Exploitation colonialism]] involved fewer colonists, typically interested in extracting resources to export to the [[metropole]].  This category includes [[trading posts]] but it also includes much larger colonies where the colonists would provide much of the administration and own much of the land and other [[capital (economics)|capital]] but rely on indigenous people for [[labour (economics)|labour]].

There is a certain amount of overlap between these models of colonialism.  In both cases people moved to the colony and goods were exported to the metropole.

A [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|plantation colony]] is normally considered to fit the model of exploitation colonialism.  However, in this case there may be other immigrants to the colony - [[Slavery|slaves]] to grow the [[cash crop]] for export.

In some cases, settler colonialism took place in substantially pre-populated areas and the result was either an ethnically mixed population (such as the [[mestizo]]s of the [[Americas]]), or a racially divided population, such as in [[French Algeria]] or [[Southern Rhodesia]].

A [[League of Nations mandate]] was legally very different from a colony.  However, there was some similarity with exploitation colonialism in the mandate system.

==History of colonialism==
{{Main|History of colonialism|Chronology of colonialism}}
[[Image:Colonisation 1800.png|thumb|300px|World map of colonialism in 1800.]]
The historical phenomenon of colonisation is one that stretches around the globe and across time, including such disparate peoples as the [[Hittites]], the [[Incas]] and the [[British people|British]], although the term ''colonialism'' is normally used with reference to discontiguous European overseas empires rather than contiguous land-based empires, European or otherwise.

Land-based empires are conventionally described by the term ''imperialism'', such as [[Age of Imperialism]] which includes Colonialism as a sub-topic, but in the main refers to conquest and domination of nearby lesser [[geographic powers]].  Examples of land-based empires include the [[Mongol Empire]], [[Chinese Empire]], the Empire of [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], the [[Persian Empire]], the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The [[Ottoman Empire]] was created across [[Mediterranean]], [[North Africa]] and into [[South-Eastern Europe]] and existed during the time of European colonization of the other parts of the world.
[[Image:Imperialism2.png|thumb|300px|This map of the world in 1900 shows the large colonial empires that powerful nations established across the globe]]
[[Image:Colonialism in 1945 updated legend.png|thumb|right|300px|World map of colonialism at the end of the Second World War in 1945.]]

After the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ''[[Reconquista]]'' period when the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] fought against the [[Muslim]] domination of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], in the 12th and 13th centuries, the Portuguese started to expand overseas. European colonialism began in 1415, with [[Portugal]]'s conquest of the Muslim port of [[Ceuta]], Northern Africa. In the following decades Portugal braved the coast of Africa [[Economic history of Portugal#15th century|establishing trading posts, ports and fortresses]]. Colonialism was led by Portuguese and [[Spain|Spanish]] exploration of the Americas, and the coasts of [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[India]], and East Asia.

On [[June 7]], [[1494]], [[Pope Alexander VI]] divided "newly discovered" lands outside Europe between Spain and Portugal along a north-south meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa).  This division was never accepted by the rulers of England or France. (See also the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] that followed the papal decree.)

The latter half of the sixteenth century witnessed the expansion of the English colonial state throughout Ireland.<ref> Ciaran Brady, The Chief Governors (Cambridge, 1994); Colm Lennon, ''Sixteenth-Century Ireland: The Incomplete Conquest''(Dublin, 1994)</ref> Despite some earlier attempts, it was not until the 17th century that [[early Modern Britain|Britain]], [[France]] and [[the Netherlands]] successfully established overseas empires outside Europe, in direct competition with Spain and Portugal and with each other. In the 19th century the [[British Empire]] grew to become the largest empire yet seen (see [[list of largest empires]]).

The end of the 18th and early 19th century saw the first era of [[decolonization]] when most of the European colonies in the Americas gained their independence from their respective [[metropole]]s.  Spain and Portugal were irreversibly weakened after the loss of their New World colonies, but [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] (after the union of England and [[Scotland]]), France and the Netherlands turned their attention to the Old World, particularly [[South Africa]], India and South East Asia, where coastal enclaves had already been established. The [[German Empire]] (now [[Federal Republic of Germany|Republic]]), created by most of [[German-speaking Europe|Germany]] being united under [[Prussia]] (omitting [[Austria]], and other ethnic-German areas) also sought colonies in [[Deutsch Ost Afrika|German East Africa]]. Territories in other parts of the world were also added to the trans-oceanic, or extra-European, [[German colonial empire]]. [[Italy]] occupied [[Eritrea]], [[Somalia]] and [[Libya]]. During the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War|First]] and the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], Italy invaded Abyssinia, and in 1936 the [[Italian East Africa|Italian Empire]] was created.
[[Image:colonisation2.gif|thumb|right|300px|World Colonization 1492<U+2013>2008]]

The industrialization of the 19th century led to what has been termed the era of [[New Imperialism]], when the pace of colonization rapidly accelerated, the height of which was the [[Scramble for Africa]].

In 1823, the United States, while expanding westward for the Pacific, had published the Monroe Doctrine in which it gave fair warning to western European expansionists to stay out of American affairs. Originally, the document targeted the spread of colonialism in Latin America and the Caribbean, deeming it oppressive and intolerable. By the end of the 19th century, interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine by individuals such as Theodore Roosevelt, viewed it as an American responsibility to ensure Central American, Caribbean, and South American economic stability that would allow those nations to repay their debts to their colonizers. In fact, under Roosevelt<U+2019>s presidency in 1904, the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine was added to the original document in order to justify colonial expansionist policies and actions by the U.S. under Roosevelt (Marks, 1979)<ref name="Marks III 1979">Marks III, Frederick W., Velvet on Iron: The Diplomacy of Theodore Roosevelt, University of Nebraska Press, 1979.</ref>. Roosevelt defended the amendment to congress in 1904 when he expressed: 
 
<blockquote>
All that this country desires is to see the neighboring countries stable, orderly, and prosperous. Any country whose people conduct themselves well can count upon our hearty friendship. If a nation shows that it knows how to act with reasonable efficiency and decency in social and political matters, if it keeps order and pays its obligations, it need fear no interference from the United States. Chronic wrongdoing, or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society, may in America, as elsewhere, ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation, and in the Western Hemisphere the adherence of the United States to the Monroe Doctrine may force the United States, however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power (Roosevelt, 1904).
</blockquote> 

In this case imperialism would now, for the first time in American history, begin to manifest itself across the bordering waters and incorporating the Philippines, Guam, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii as American territories.

America was successful in <U+201C>liberating<U+201D> the territories of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. U.S. government replaced the existing government in Hawaii in 1893; it was annexed into the American union as an offshore territory in 1898.  Between 1898 and 1902, Cuba was a territory of the United States along with Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, which were all colonies gained by the United States from Spain. In 1946, the Philippines was granted independence from the United States and Puerto Rico still to this day remains a territory of the United States along with America Samoa, Guam, and The U.S. Virgin Islands. In Cuba, the Platt Amendment was replaced in 1934 by the Treaty of Relations which granted Cuba less intervention by U.S. government on matters of economy and international relations.  1934 would also be the year that, under the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, that the Good Neighbor Policy was adopted in order to limit American intervention in South and Central America.  <ref name="Marks III 1979"/><ref>Anderson, Benedict, Under Three Flags; Anarchism and the Anti-Colonial Imagination, Verso, New York, 2005.</ref>

During the 20th century, the overseas colonies of the losers of [[World War I]] were distributed amongst the victors as [[Mandate (international law)|mandates]], but it was not until the end of [[World War II]] that the second phase of decolonization began in earnest.

==Neocolonialism==
The term [[neocolonialism]] has been used to refer to a variety of things since the decolonisation efforts after [[World War II]].  Generally it does not refer to a type of colonialism but rather colonialism by other means.  Specifically, the accusation that the relationship between stronger and weaker countries is similar to [[exploitation colonialism]], without the stronger country having to build or maintain colonies.  Such accusations typically focus on economic relationships and interference in the politics of weaker countries by stronger countries.

==Post-colonialism==
{{Main|Post-colonialism|Postcolonial literature}}

Post-colonialism (aka post-colonial theory) refers to a set of theories in philosophy and literature that grapple with the legacy of colonial rule. In this sense, postcolonial literature may be considered a branch of [[Postmodern literature]] concerned with the political and cultural independence of peoples formerly subjugated in colonial empires. Many practitioners take [[Edward Said]]'s book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978) to be the theory's founding work (although French theorists such as [[Aim<U+00E9> C<U+00E9>saire]] and [[Frantz Fanon]] made similar claims decades before Said).

Edward Said analyzed the works of [[Honor<U+00E9> de Balzac|Balzac]], [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]] and [[Lautr<U+00E9>amont]], exploring how they were both influenced by and helped to shape a societal fantasy of European racial superiority. Post-colonial fictional writers interact with the traditional colonial [[discourse]], but modify or subvert it; for instance by retelling a familiar story from the perspective of an oppressed minor character in the story. [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]]'s ''[[Subaltern (post-colonialism)|Can the Subaltern Speak?]]'' (1998) gave its name to the [[Subaltern Studies]].

In ''A Critique of Postcolonial Reason'' (1999), Spivak explored how major works of European [[metaphysics]] (e.g., [[Kant]], [[Hegel]]) not only tend to exclude the subaltern from their discussions, but actively prevent non-Europeans from occupying positions as fully human [[subject (philosophy)|subjects]]. Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807) is famous for its explicit ethnocentrism, in considering the [[Western culture|Western civilization]] as the most accomplished of all, while Kant also allowed some traces of [[racialism]] to enter his work.

==Impact of colonialism and colonisation==
{{Main|Impact and evaluation of colonialism and colonisation}}

Debate about the perceived negative and positive aspects (spread of virulent [[Pandemic|diseases]], unequal social relations, exploitation, [[enslavement]], [[infrastructure]]s, [[History of medicine#Modern medicine|medical advances]], new institutions,technological advancements etc.) of colonialism has occurred for centuries, amongst both colonizer and colonized, and continues to the present day.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1713275,00.html Come Back, Colonialism, All is Forgiven]</ref> The questions of [[miscegenation]]; the alleged ties between colonial enterprises, [[genocides]] &mdash; see the [[Herero Genocide]] and the [[Armenian Genocide]] &mdash; and the [[Holocaust]]; and the questions of the nature of imperialism, [[dependency theory]] and [[neocolonialism]] (in particular the Third World debt) continue to retain their actuality.

===Impact on health===

Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. Disease killed the entire native ([[Guanches]]) population of the [[Canary Islands]] in the 16th century. Half the native population of [[Hispaniola]] in 1518 was killed by [[smallpox]]. Smallpox also ravaged [[Mexico]] in the 1520s, killing 150,000 in [[Tenochtitl<U+00E1>n]] alone, including the emperor, and [[Peru]] in the 1530s, aiding the European conquerors.<ref name="Smallpox: Eradicating the Scourge"/> [[Measles]] killed a further two million Mexican natives in the 1600s.

===Food security===
After 1492, a [[Columbian exchange|global exchange]] of previously local crops and livestock breeds occurred. Key crops involved in this exchange included the tomato, maize, potato and manioc going from the New World to the Old. At the founding of the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1368, [[China]]'s population was reported to be close to 60 million, and toward the end of the dynasty in 1644 it might have approached 150 million.<ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761580643/ming_dynasty.html Ming Dynasty].

Colonialism is not a modern phenomenon.<ref name="Colonialism"/> A variety of ancient and more recent examples whereby ethnically distinct groups settle in areas other than their original settlement that are either adjacent or across land or sea. From about 750 BC the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] began 250 years of expansion, settling [[Colonies in antiquity|colonies]] in all directions. [[Phoenicia]]n civilization was an enterprising [[thalassocracy|maritime trading culture]] that spread across the Mediterranean during the period 1550 BC to 300 BC. Other examples range from large empire like the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Arab Empire]], the [[Mongol Empire]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] or small movements like ancient [[Scottish people|Scots]] moving from [[Ireland|Hibernia]] to [[Scotland|Caledonia]] and Magyars into [[Pannonia]] (modern-day [[Hungary]]). [[Turkic peoples]] spread across most of [[Central Asia]] into [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] between the 6th and 11th centuries. Recent research suggests that [[Madagascar]] was uninhabited until [[Malay World|Malay]] seafarers from [[Indonesia]] arrived during the 5th and 6th centuries A.D. Subsequent migrations from both the Pacific and Africa further consolidated this original mixture, and [[Malagasy people]] emerged.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-359466/article-9050264 Malagasy languages], [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]</ref>   

Before the expansion of the [[Bantu languages]] and their speakers, the southern half of Africa is believed to have been populated by [[Pygmies]] and [[Khoisan]] speaking people, today occupying the arid regions around the [[Kalahari]] and the forest of Central Africa. By about 1000 AD Bantu migration had reached modern day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]]. The [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Maqil|Banu Ma'qil]] were a collection of [[Arab]] [[Bedouin]] tribes from the [[Arabian peninsula]] who migrated westwards via [[Egypt]] between the 11th and 13th centuries. Their migration strongly contributed to the [[arabization]] and [[islamization]] of the western [[Maghreb]], which was until then dominated by [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes. [[Ostsiedlung]] was the medieval eastward migration and settlement of [[Ethnic Germans|Germans]]. The 13th century was the time of the great [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] migrations across [[Eurasia]].  Between the 11th and 18th centuries, the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] expanded southward in a process known as [[History of Vietnam#Ming occupation and the rise of the Le dynasty|nam ti<U+1EBF>n]] (southward expansion).<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/11.htm The Le Dynasty and Southward Expansion]</ref>  

More recent examples of internal colonialism are the movement of ethnic [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] into [[Tibet]]<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4954926.stm Han Chinese describe life in Tibet], April 29, 2006, BBC News</ref><ref>[http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10880709 Revolt in Tibet | A colonial uprising], March 19, 2008, The Economist</ref> and [[Xinjiang|Eastern Turkestan]]<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2008/03/2008525184819409441.html Xinjiang: China's 'other Tibet'], March 25, 2008, Al Jazeera</ref>, ethnic [[Javanese people|Javanese]] into [[Western New Guinea]] and [[Kalimantan]]<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s253467.htm Ethnic violence continues to rage in Central Kalimantan]</ref> (see [[Transmigration program]]), [[Demography of Brazil|Brazilians]] into [[Amazonia]]<ref>[http://news.mongabay.com/2007/0827-atbc.html Scientists demand Brazil suspend Amazon colonization project]</ref>, Israelis into the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza]], ethnic [[Arabs]] into Iraqi [[Kurdistan]], and ethnic [[Russians]] into [[Siberia]] and [[Central Asia]].<ref>Robert Greenall, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4420922.stm Russians left behind in Central Asia], [[BBC News]], [[23 November]] [[2005]].</ref> The local populations or tribes, such as the [[aboriginal people]] in Canada, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Japan<ref>[http://www.hurights.or.jp/asia-pacific/no_04/06reporton.htm Report on a New Policy for the Ainu: A Critique]</ref>, Siberia and the United States, were usually far overwhelmed numerically by the settlers.

In some cases, for example the  [[Vandal]]s, [[Huguenot]]s, [[Boer]]s, [[Matabele]]s and [[Sioux]], the colonizers were fleeing more powerful enemies, as part of a chain reaction of colonization.

[[The Empire of Japan]] was in some ways modelled on Western colonial Empires.
