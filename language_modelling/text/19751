'''C<U+00E9>cile DeWitt-Morette''' (b. 1922) is a French mathematician and physicist. She founded an important summer school at [[Les Houches]] in the [[French Alps]]. For this and her publications she was awarded the   American Society of the French Legion of Honor 2007 Medal for Distinguished Achievement.<ref name=legion/> Attendees at the summer school included over twenty students who would go on to be Nobel Prize winners<ref name="dyk"/> including [[Pierre-Gilles de Gennes]], [[Georges Charpak]] and [[Claude Cohen-Tannoudji]], who identify the school for assisting in their success.<ref name=senior/> 

==Life==
C<U+00E9>cile Morette was born in 1922 and brought up in [[Normandy]]; she originally decided to become a surgeon. She moved to mathematics after taking a sample course to develop her education. She had to deal with a tragedy when her mother, her sister and her grandmother were killed in the Allied bombing of [[Caen]] to support the [[D-Day]] landings. At the time Morette was studying in Paris. She completed her Ph.D (''Sur la Production des m<U+00E9>sons dans les chocs entre nucl<U+00E9>ons'') in 1947.<ref name=works>[http://godel.ph.utexas.edu/Members/cdewitt/pubsCecile.pdf List of publications], University of Texas, accessed March 2010</ref>

The following year she was invited by [[Robert Oppenheimer]] to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].<ref name=senior/> Oppenheimer had just taken up the position left vacant by [[Albert Einstein]].<ref name="IAmBecome">{{cite news

She rationalised this by deciding to start a school in France in 1951. The school started with a course in [[quantum mechanics]] and was intended to assist France following the [[Second World War]]. She founded the summer school at [[Les Houches]] in the [[French Alps]].<ref name="houches">{{cite web|url=http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://houches.ujf-grenoble.fr/&ei=e3ufS86hFMyK4gbp4LWXDg&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAsQ7gEwAA&prev=/search%3Fq%3DL%2527Ecole%2Bde%2BPhysique%2Bdes%2BHouches%2Baccueille%26hl%3Den%26rlz%3D1C1GGLS_en-GBGB366GB366|title=L'Ecole de Physique des Houches (English translation)|language=French|accessdate=16 March 2010}}</ref> She tells stories of how she obtained the funding by tricking her way into a minister's office and then persuaded her male colleagues to support the idea by pretending that the idea was theirs.<ref name=senior>[http://www.seniorwomen.com/articles/articlesIntCecile.html C<U+00E9>cile DeWitt-Morette], Emil Mitchell, Senior Women, accessed March 2010</ref>  Morette was able to marry the American physicist [[Bryce DeWitt]] and they had four children.<!--this sentence doesn't belong here, but needs a cite--> Morette was to lead this school for the next 22 years.

Morette found that she did suffer some discrimination in America. She had originally adopted her husband's name, but found that her work was attributed to him. Later they were both visiting Professors at a University that downgraded Morette, claiming that they did this under a clause to prevent two family members having power. This was despite the significant contribution by Morette.<ref name=senior/>

In 1953 a trustee of the unusual [[Gravity Research Foundation]], Agnew Bahnson, contacted [[Bryce DeWitt]] with a proposal to fund a gravity research institute. The proposed name was agreed as the "Institute for Field Physics" and it was established in 1956 at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] under the direction of Bryce and Morette.<ref>[http://cwp.library.ucla.edu/Phase2/DeWitt-Morette,_Cecile@862345678.html CWP at physics.UCLA.edu // Cecile DeWitt-Morette<!-- bot-generated title -->] at cwp.library.ucla.edu</ref>

In 1972 Morette and her husband led an expedition to [[Mauritania]] to confirm that light was deflected in line with the theory of [[General relativity]]. These measurements were made during the [[solar eclipse]] there. Comparison of the pictures with those made six months later confirmed that, in line with theory, light was indeed bent when passing by massive objects.<ref>[http://www.maa.org/features/010906jan_archives.html Archives of American Mathematics Spotlight: The Bryce S. DeWitt Papers], Kristy Sorensen, accessed March 2010</ref> Morette and her husband joined the faculty of the University of Texas in 1972. She began to work increasingly in Physics rather than in Mathematics and she became a Professor in 1985.<ref name=senior/>

Bryce DeWitt died in 2004 from cancer. In 2007 Professor C<U+00E9>cile DeWitt-Morette was awarded the American Society of the French Legion of Honor 2007 Medal for Distinguished Achievement in New York. She was then the Jane and Roland Blumberg Centennial Professor Emerita of Physics at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].<ref name=legion>[http://www.ph.utexas.edu/news.html Department of Physics News], University of Texas at Austin, accessed March 2010</ref>
