== History ==
=== Composition ===
The song's lyrics are, for the most part, about the group's flight to London in August 1965 and their accompanying English tour, as illustrated by the opening couplet: "Eight miles high and when you touch down, you'll find that it's stranger than known."<!--See talk page for discussion of this lyric--><ref name="timeless2"/>  Although commercial airliners fly at an [[altitude]] of six to seven miles, it was felt that "eight miles high" sounded more poetic than six and also recalled the title of [[The Beatles]]' song "[[Eight Days a Week (song)|Eight Days a Week]]".<ref name="timeless2"/>

According to Clark, the lyrics were primarily his creation, with a minor contribution being David Crosby's line, "Rain grey town, known for its sound", a reference to London being home to the [[British Invasion]] that was dominating the U.S. charts at the time.<ref name="einarson"/><ref name="timeless2"/><ref name="mcguinn">{{cite web|author=McGuinn, Camilla|title=Eight Miles High|publisher=[[Roger McGuinn]]'s Official Blog|url=http://rogermcguinn.blogspot.com/2009/02/roadie-report-45-eight-miles-high-by.html|accessdate=2009-11-08}}</ref>  Other lyrics found in the song that explicitly refer to The Byrds' stay in England include the couplet: "Nowhere is there warmth to be found/Among those afraid of losing their ground", which is a reference to the hostile reaction of the UK music press and to the English group [[The Birds (band)|The Birds]] serving the band with a [[copyright infringement]] [[writ]], due to the similarities in name.<ref name="mcguinn"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Fitzsimmons, Mick|title=Sold on Song: Eight Miles High|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/songlibrary/eightmileshigh.shtml|accessdate=2009-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|page=95|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref>  In addition, "Round the squares, huddled in storms/Some laughing, some just shapeless forms" describes the fans who waited for the band outside their hotels, while the line "Sidewalk scenes and black limousines" refers to the excited crowds that jostled the band as they exited their chauffeur driven cars.<ref name="mcguinn"/>

Although the basic idea for the song had been discussed during the band's flight to England, it didn't actually begin to take shape until The Byrds' November 1965 tour of the U.S.<ref name="einarson"/>  In order to alleviate the boredom of travelling from show to show during the tour, Crosby had brought along [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] recordings of Ravi Shankar's music and the John Coltrane albums ''[[Impressions (John Coltrane album)|Impressions]]'' and ''[[Africa/Brass]]'', which were on constant rotation on the tour bus.<ref name="timeless5">{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|page=141|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|page=75|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965<U+2013>1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0}}</ref>  The influence of these recordings on the band would manifest itself in the music of "Eight Miles High" and its B-side "Why".<ref name="timeless5"/>

Clark began writing the song's lyrics on November 24, 1965, when he scribbled down some rough ideas for later development, following a discussion with [[guitarist]] [[Brian Jones]], prior to The Byrds making a concert appearance supporting [[The Rolling Stones]].<ref name="einarson"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|page=72|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965<U+2013>1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0}}</ref>  Over the following days, Clark expanded this fragment into a full poem, eventually setting the words to music and giving them a [[melody]].<ref name="einarson"/>  Clark then showed the song to McGuinn and Crosby, with the former suggesting that the song be arranged to incorporate the influence of Coltrane.<ref name="einarson"/>  Since Clark's death, however, McGuinn has contended that it was he who conceived the initial idea of writing a song about an airplane ride and that he and Crosby both contributed lyrics to Clark's unfinished draft.<ref name="einarson"/> In his book, ''Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of The Byrds' Gene Clark'', author John Einarson disputes this claim and ponders whether McGuinn's story would be the same were Clark still alive.<ref name="einarson"/>

The [[master recording]] of "Eight Miles High" was recorded on January 24 and 25, 1966, at Columbia Studios in Hollywood, with [[record producer]] Allen Stanton guiding the band through the recording process.<ref name = "Rogan 1998 620">{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|page=620|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref>  John Einarson has noted that the influence of Coltrane's [[saxophone]] playing and, in particular, his song "India" from the ''Impressions'' album, can be clearly heard in "Eight Miles High"<U+2014>most noticeably in McGuinn's reoccurring [[twelve-string guitar]] solo.<ref name="einarson"/>  In addition to this striking guitar [[Motif (music)|motif]], the song is also highlighted by [[Chris Hillman]]'s driving and hypnotic bass line, Crosby's chunky [[rhythm guitar]] playing and the band's ethereal [[Vocal harmony|harmonies]].<ref name="einarson"/><ref name="timeless"/><ref name="priore">{{cite book|author=Priore, Domenic.|page=81|year=2007|title=Riot On Sunset Strip: Rock 'n' Roll's Last Stand in Hollywood|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-04-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Eder, Bruce|title=Eight Miles High|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=Rovi Corporation|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/eight-miles-high-mt0004752042|accessdate=2009-11-10}}</ref>

"Eight Miles High" also exhibits the influence of sitarist Ravi Shankar, particularly in the droning quality of the song's vocal melody and in McGuinn's guitar playing.<ref name="lavezzoli">{{cite book|author=Lavezzoli, Peter.|pages=155<U+2013>157|year=2007|title=The Dawn of Indian music in the West|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=0-8264-2819-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Crosby, David.|page=99|year=1990|title=Long Time Gone: The Autobiography of David Crosby|publisher=Mandarin Paperbacks|isbn=0-7493-0283-6}}</ref>  However, the song does not actually feature the sound of the [[sitar]], despite The Byrds having appeared brandishing the instrument at a contemporary [[News conference|press conference]] held to promote the single.<ref name="timeless"/>  In a 1966 promotional interview, which was added to the expanded [[Compact Disc|CD]] reissue of the ''Fifth Dimension'' album, Crosby said that the song's ending made him "feel like a plane landing."

An earlier version of "Eight Miles High" was recorded at [[RCA Records|RCA]] Studios in Los Angeles on December 22, 1965, but [[Columbia Records]] refused to release that recording because it had not been produced at a Columbia-owned studio.<ref name="timeless"/><ref name= "Rogan 1998 620"/>  McGuinn has since stated that he believes this original version of the song to be more spontaneous sounding than the better known Columbia release.<ref name="timeless"/>  That opinion was echoed by Crosby, who commented "It was a stunner, it was better, it was stronger. It had more flow to it. It was the way we wanted it to be."<ref name="timeless"/>  This original version of "Eight Miles High" initially saw release on the 1987 archival album ''[[Never Before (album)|Never Before]]'' and was also included as a [[bonus track]] on the 1996 [[Legacy Recordings|Columbia/Legacy]] CD reissue of ''Fifth Dimension''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Connors, Tim|title=Fifth Dimension|work=Byrdwatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|publisher=Euclid Business Network|url=http://ebni.com/byrds/lp5d.html|accessdate=2009-11-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|year=1996|title=Fifth Dimension (1996 CD liner notes)}}</ref>

== Release and legacy ==
===U.S. radio ban===
"Eight Miles High" was released on March 14, 1966 in the U.S. and May 29, 1966 in the UK, reaching number 14 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and number 24 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="timeless4"/><ref name="whitburn"/><ref name="brown"/><ref name="hjort"/>  Following its release, the band faced allegations of advocating the use of [[Psychoactive_drug#Recreational_use|recreational drugs]] from ''[[Gavin Report|Bill Gavin's Record Report]]'', a weekly newsletter circulated to U.S. radio stations.<ref name="timeless2"/>  This resulted in "Eight Miles High" being banned in a number of states within a week of the report being published, a factor which contributed to the single's failure to break into the ''Billboard'' Top 10.<ref name="timeless2"/> The Byrds and their [[publicist]], [[Derek Taylor]], countered by strenuously denying that the song was drug-related, with Taylor issuing an indignant press release unequivocally stating that the song was about the band's trip to England and not drug use.<ref name="timeless"/>  However, by the early 1980s, both Crosby and Clark were prepared to admit that the song was not entirely as innocent as they had originally declared, with the former stating "Of course it was a drug song! We were stoned when we wrote it."<ref name="timeless"/>  Clark was less blunt, explaining in interview that "it was about a lot of things. It was about the airplane trip to England, it was about drugs, it was about all that. A piece of poetry of that nature is not limited to having it have to be just about airplanes or having it have to be just about drugs. It was inclusive because during those days the new experimenting with all the drugs was a very vogue thing to do."<ref name="einarson"/>

Research analyst Mark Teehan, writing for Popular Musicology Online, has challenged the widely held view among critics, music historians and The Byrds themselves that the U.S. radio ban hurt sales of "Eight Miles High".<ref name="pmo"/>  Having examined the local music surveys and the ''Billboard'' regional retail sales charts, as they relate to the national charting of "Eight Miles High", Teehan has uncovered evidence suggesting that the progressive and uncommercial nature of the song was a much bigger factor in its failure to reach the ''Billboard'' Top 10.<ref name="pmo"/>  The author's research revealed that "Eight Miles High" failed to reach the Top Five in any of his sample of 23 regional markets, and most telling, among the thirty radio stations included within this sample, it reached the Top 10 on only seven of them (23%).<ref name="pmo"/>  

Teehan also points out that although the ''Gavin Report'' recommended that radio stations withdraw the single from airplay, many stations did not comply with this request.<ref name="pmo"/>  In addition, Teehan notes that the radio ban was not suggested by the ''Gavin Report'' until April 29, 1966, almost seven weeks after the single had initially been released<U+2014>ample time for it to have made its mark on the charts.<ref name="pmo"/>  Teehan has also uncovered evidence showing that "Eight Miles High" was already decelerating on the national charts prior to the end of April 1966.<ref name="pmo"/>  The author concludes that the groundbreaking song lacked strong commercial appeal by virtue of its complexity, unique sound and excessive length (commercial radio stations were reluctant to play songs that were over two-and-a-half minutes long during the mid-1960s), and that it also suffered from uncoordinated and inefficient promotion by Columbia Records.<ref name="pmo"/>

===Influence and reception===
[[File:The Byrds Raga Rock.png|220px|thumb|right|The Byrds at the "Eight Miles High" press conference in March 1966, posing with a sitar in order to illustrate the Indian influences present in the song.]]
The song's use of Indian and [[Free jazz|free-form jazz]] influences, along with its impressionistic lyrics, were immediately influential on the emerging genre of psychedelic rock.<ref name="hjort"/><ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|title=Psychedelic/Garage Overview|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=Rovi Corporation|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/psychedelic-garage-ma0000002800|accessdate=2012-05-30}}</ref>  As such, a number of authors and music historians, including Eric V. D. Luft, Domenic Priore and Dwight Rounds, have described "Eight Miles High" as being the first ''bona fide'' psychedelic rock song.<ref>{{cite book|author=Luft, Eric V. D.|page=155|year=2009|title=Die at the Right Time!: A Subjective Cultural History of the American Sixties|publisher=Gegenstaz Press|isbn=0-9655179-2-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Priore, Domenic|page=38|year=200|title=SMiLE: The Story of Brian Wilson's Lost Masterpiece|publisher=Sanctuary|isbn=1-86074-627-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Rounds, Dwight|page=59|year=2007|title=The Year the Music Died: 1964-1972: A Commentary on the Best Era of Pop|publisher=Bridgeway Books|isbn=1-933538-69-4}}</ref>  In his book ''Riot On Sunset Strip: Rock 'n' Roll's Last Stand in Hollywood'', Priore also cites "Eight Miles High" as being the record that kicked off the psychedelic craze, explaining "prior to 'Eight Miles High,' there were no pop records with incessant, hypnotic basslines juxtaposed by droning, trance-induced improvisational guitar."<ref name="priore"/>

The song was also responsible for the naming of the musical subgenre [[raga rock]], when journalist Sally Kempton, in her review of the single for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', first used the term to describe the record's experimental fusion of eastern and western music.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|page=88|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965<U+2013>1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0}}</ref>  However, although Kempton was the first person to use the term "raga rock" in print, she had actually borrowed the phrase from the promotional material that The Byrds' press office had supplied to accompany the "Eight Miles High" single release.<ref name="bellman"/>  In his 1968 [[Pop Chronicles]] interview, McGuinn denied that the song was in fact an example of "raga rock", while Crosby, speaking in 1998, dismissed the term, stating "they kept trying to label us; every time we turned around, they came up with a new one ... it's a bunch of bullshit."<ref name="pc35"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Connors, Tim|title=The Byrdwatcher Interview with David Crosby: Part Five|publisher=Euclid Business Network Incorporated|url=http://ebni.com/byrds/newsbwidc5.html|accessdate=2012-06-21}}</ref>  Nonetheless, the experimental nature of the song placed The Byrds firmly at the forefront of the burgeoning psychedelic movement, along with [[The Yardbirds]], The Beatles, [[Donovan]] and The Rolling Stones, who were all exploring similar musical territory concurrently.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Contemporary reviews for the single were mostly positive, with [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine describing the song as a "Big beat rhythm rocker with soft lyric ballad vocal and off-beat instrumental backing."<ref name="hjort"/>  ''[[Record World]]'' magazine also praised the song, commenting "It's an eerie tune with lyrics bound to hypnotize. Will climb heights."<ref name="hjort"/>  In the UK, ''Music Echo'' described the song as "wild and oriental but still beaty".  The publication also suggested that with the release of "Eight Miles High" The Byrds had jumped ahead of The Beatles in terms of creativity, stating "[By] getting their single out now they've beaten The Beatles to the punch, for Paul [McCartney] admitted recently that the Liverpool foursome are working on a similar sound for their new album and single."<ref name="hjort2"/>  In recent years, [[Richie Unterberger]], writing for the [[Allmusic]] website, has described "Eight Miles High" as "one of the greatest singles of the '60s."<ref name="unterberger"/>

In 1999, the song was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award|Grammy Hall of Fame]], an honor reserved for "recordings of lasting qualitative or historical significance that are at least 25 years old."<ref>{{cite web|title=GRAMMY Hall of Fame: Past Recipients|work=GRAMMY.org|publisher=The Recording Academy|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/hall-of-fame|accessdate=2012-06-22}}</ref>  In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked "Eight Miles High" at number 151 on their list of ''[[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]''<ref>{{cite web|title=The 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner  Media|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/the-byrds-eight-miles-high-19691231|accessdate=2012-05-30}}</ref> and in March 2005, [[Q magazine|''Q'' magazine]] placed the song at number 50 on their list of the ''100 Greatest Guitar Tracks''.<ref>{{cite web|title=100 Greatest Guitar Tracks|publisher=Rockandrollreport.com|url=http://rockandrollreport.com/the-q-magazine-100-greatest-guitar-tracks-ever/|accessdate=2009-11-08}}</ref>
