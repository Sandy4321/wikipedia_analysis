'''MV ''TransAtlantic''''' is a [[United States|U.S.-flagged]] [[container ship]] owned and operated by [[TransAtlantic Lines LLC]].  <!--1 Construction -->The {{convert|100|m|ft|adj=on}} long ship was built at Wuhu Shipyard in [[Wuhu City|Wuhu]], [[China]] in 1997 as ''Steamers Future''.  <!--2 History --><!--2.1 Under the Singaporean flag -->  Originally owned by Singapore's [[Keppel Corporation]], she has had three owners, been registered under three flags, and been renamed ten times.

<!--2.2 Under the United States flag --><!--2.2.1 Sealift charter -->From 2004 to 2009, the ship, under the name '''''Baffin Strait''''' (T-AK W9519), was one of [[Military Sealift Command]]'s seven chartered container ships, and delivered 250 containers every month from [[Singapore]] to [[Diego Garcia]].<ref name="msc0">[http://web.archive.org/web/20090505163309/http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/ships.asp?ship=8&type=ContainerShip MSC Baffin Strait Page]</ref><ref name="dgar">

<!-- Capacity -->
Although much of its career has been spent crossing oceans, the ship's container-carrying capacity of {{TEU|384|first=yes}} (384 20-foot [[shipping container]]s) places it in the range of a [[Container_ship#Size_categories|small feeder ship]].<ref name="fearnleys"/><ref name="man">MAN Diesel, 2009, p.6.</ref>  The ship's [[gross tonnage]], a measure of the volume of all its enclosed spaces, is 4,276.<ref name="dnv-sum"/><ref name="imo1982">International Maritime Organization, 2002.</ref>  Its [[net tonnage]], which measures the volume of the cargo spaces, is 2,129.<ref name="dnv-sum"/><ref name="imo1982"/>  Its total carrying capacity in terms of weight, is {{DWT|5,055|long|first=yes}}, the equivalent of almost 170 [[Sherman tank]]s.<ref name="dnv-sum"/>

It burns between {{convert|16.6|to|38.3|USgal}} per hour of [[diesel fuel]] and weighs between {{convert|3900|lb|kg}} and {{convert|4200|lb|kg}}.

On the evening of 22 April 2009, ''Baffin Strait'' was involved with a collision with the [[car carrier]] ''Jasmine Ace'' while both vessels were anchored in Singapore.<ref name="jasmine">[http://psix.uscg.mil/IIR/IIRSearchResults.aspx?ActID=iSQtj+XOnkU= Investigation Activity Report: JASMINE ACE; Collision On: 4/22/2009]</ref>  A severe squall moved into the area while ''Jasmine Ace'' was taking fuel.<ref name="jasmine"/>  The squall caused the ship to drag its anchor.<ref name="jasmine"/>  The car carrier drifted downwind, causing its starboard quarter to strike ''Baffin Strait''{{'s}} starboard side.<ref name="jasmine"/>   As a result, ''Baffin Strait''{{'s}} anchor also began to drag, and the crew dropped a second anchor to hold the ship.<ref name="jasmine"/>  The two ships were "married for several minutes", during which time the ''Jasmine Ace'' started her engine.<ref name="jasmine"/>  The ''Baffin Strait''{{'s}} damage included "disfigured" steel on the starboard bulwark and damage to the starboard [[running light]].<ref name="jasmine"/>

<!-- End of Charter --------------------------------------------------- -->
On 27 March 2009, Military Sealift Command announced a [[request for proposal]]s (number N00033-09-R-5502) for the Diego Garcia service.<ref name="gib-1">Gibson, 2009, p. 1.</ref>  The charter contract would be for a one-year probation period, followed by three one-year options, and concluding with an eleven-month option.<ref name="gib-1"/>  The fixed-price [[time charter]] would be supplemented by reimbursements for costs such as the ship's fuel.<ref name="gib-1"/>  The RFP stipulated that the charter would be awarded to the lowest-priced proposal which the Navy found technically acceptable.<ref name="gib-2">Gibson, 2009, p. 2.</ref>

Six companies submitted proposals, with TransAtlantic proposing the MV ''Rio Bogota'' (which it intended to rename ''Heidi B'') to replace the ''Baffin Strait''.<ref name="gib-2"/>  While the Navy was assessing the proposals, rival shipping company Sealift Incorporated secured the rights to operate ''Rio Bogota'', and TransAtlantic countered by altering its proposal to offer the ship MV ''LS Aizenshtat'' instead.<ref name="gib-2"/><ref name="gib-3">Gibson, 2009, p. 3.</ref>  The Navy deemed both companies' proposals technically acceptable and their past performance satisfactory.<ref name="gib-3"/>  Sealift's proposed rate, was more than $3 million less than TransAtlantic's ($39,031,093 versus $42,415,356), and they were awarded the charter.<ref name="gib-3"/>  After winning the contract, Sealift purchased ''Rio Bogota'' on 21 August 2009.<ref name="gib-3"/>

[[File:Mv-transatlantic-pierside-san-juan.jpg|thumb|''TransAtlantic'' pierside in San Juan, Puerto Rico, 2011.]]After finishing the Diego Garcia contract, the ship sailed from Singapore on 19 November 2009 for a shipyard period in Wilmington, North Carolina by way of the Suez Canal.  

On 16 January 2010, while pierside in Wilmington, the ship was picketed by members of the [[Seafarers International Union]].<ref name="wect">{{cite web |url=http://www.wect.com/story/11834325/union-holds-informational-picket-for-better-wages-and-benefits |title=Union holds informational picket for better wages and benefits |first=Claire |last=Hosmann |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2010-01-16 |month= |year= |work= |publisher=WECT Channel 6 |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans_title= |format= |arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |doibroken= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc = |embargo= |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate=2011-08-11 |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=}}</ref>  According to the union's Assistant Vice President, Bryan Powell, crewmembers' "wages are substandard.

On 31 March 2010, industry journal [[TradeWinds (newspaper)|''Tradewinds'']] reported that ''Baffin Strait'' was the first vessel ever to be involuntarily disenrolled from the United States Coast Guard's Alternative Compliance Program, in which the Coast Guard delegates inspections and certificate issuance to the vessel's classification society.<ref name="acp">{{cite web |url=http://www.tradewinds.no/weekly/w2010-04-01/article556589.ece |title=Vessel ejected from US scheme |first=Bob Rust |last=Stamford |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2010-03-31 |month= |year= |work= |publisher=Tradewinds AS |location=Oslo, Norway |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans_title=A history of deficiencies has led US officials to kick out a US-flag vessel. |format= |arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |doibroken= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc = |embargo= |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate=2011-08-05 |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript=}}</ref> The move was prompted by deficiencies to the ship's firefighting and lifesaving programs reported by Coast Guard inspectors in Singapore remaining

Notes from PSIX

4000038 - San Juan, PR	April 29, 2011
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Demonstrate that the sprinkler system can operate at the required design output independent of the vessel's draft. The current output at the sprinkler pump is 50 psi; the required output must be a least 82 psi as per the approved design calculations to ensure each sprinkler head meets the required flow rate and coverage.

nstall an orifice in the discharge line for the cargo hold sprinkler pump to regulate the discharge pressure to 93.5 psi. To be completed at the next dry-dock.

Demonstrate that the ballast pumps are capable of pumping at 125 % of the sprinkler pump output regardless of the water head in the cargo hold; this is to prevent the buildup of free surface. Currently with both ballast pumps in operation they are just keeping up with the output of the sprinkler pump.
