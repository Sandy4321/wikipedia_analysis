==History==
[[File:Cathay City.JPG|thumb|Cathay Pacific City, the headquarters|alt=Cathay Pacific City]]

===Early years===
Cathay Pacific was founded in [[Hong Kong]] on 24 September 1946 by American [[Roy Farrell]] and Australian [[Sydney de Kantzow]].<ref name=hist>{{cite web|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_INTL/aboutus/cxbackground/history|title=History - Those Were the Days|publisher=Cathay Pacific|accessdate=2009-04-02}}</ref> Both men were ex-air force pilots who had flown [[the Hump]], a route over the [[Himalaya]]n mountains.<ref name=hump>{{cite web|title=Cathay Pacific Airways Limited|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Cathay-Pacific-Airways-Limited-Company-History.html|publisher=FundingUniverse|accessdate=2009-07-09}}</ref> Each man put up [[HK$]]1 to register the airline.<ref name=HKD1>{{cite web|title=Airline Profile - Cathay Pacific|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/landingpage/cathay%20pacific.html|work=Flightglobal.com|publisher=Reed Business Information|accessdate=2009-07-09}}</ref> Although initially based in [[Shanghai]], the two men moved to Hong Kong where they formally began Cathay Pacific.<ref name=hist/> They named it ''[[Cathay]]'' the ancient name given to [[names of China|China]], derived from "Khitan", and ''Pacific'' because Farrell speculated that they would one day fly across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] (which happened in the 1970s). The Chinese name for the company "<U+570B><U+6CF0>" comes from a Chinese idiom meaning "Grand and Peaceful State".<ref name=name>{{cite web|url=http://www.airhighways.com/cathay_pacific.htm|title=Cathay Pacific sees opportunity in Shenzhen|publisher=, Air Highways|accessdate=2006-03-08}}</ref>

According to legend, the airline was conceived by Farrell and some foreign correspondents at the bar of the Manila Hotel.<ref name=hist/> On Cathay Pacific's maiden voyage, Farrell and de Kantzow flew from Hong Kong to [[Manila]], and later on to Shanghai.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cathay Pacific chief executive meets President Arroyo as airline celebrates 60 years of serving the Philippines|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/ceb/2006/10/12/life/cathay.pacific.chief.executive.meets.president.arroyo.as.airline.celebrates.60.years.of.serving.the.philippines..html|date=12 October 2006|publisher=Sun.Star Cebu|accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref> They had a single [[Douglas DC-3]], nicknamed ''Betsy''.

===Expansion in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s===
The airline prospered in late 1950s and into the 1960s by buying its archrival, [[Hong Kong Airways]], on 1 July 1959.<ref name=HKA>{{cite book|title=Beyond Lion Rock|last=Young|first=Gavin|authorlink=Gavin Young|year=1988|publisher=Hutchinson|isbn=978-0091737245|page=117}}</ref> Between 1962 and 1967, the airline recorded double digit growth on average every year and the world's first to operate international services to [[Fukuoka]], [[Nagoya]] and [[Osaka]] in [[Japan]].<ref name=hist/> Eighteen years after the airline was founded, it carried its one millionth passenger and acquired its first jet engine aircraft [[Convair 880]] in 1964.<ref name=hump/><ref name=Horizon>{{cite web|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_INTL/aboutus/cxbackground/history?refID=9cf4b9b4b92eb010VgnVCM10000010d21c39____|title=History - New Horizons|publisher=Cathay Pacific|accessdate=2009-06-21}}</ref> In the 1970s, Cathay Pacific installed a computerised reservation system and flight simulators. In 1979, the airline acquired its first [[Boeing 747]] and applied for traffic rights to begin flying to [[London]] in 1980. Expansion continued into the 1980s, with nonstop service to [[Vancouver]] in 1983, with continuing service on to [[San Francisco]] in 1986 when an industry-wide boom encouraged route growth to many [[Europe]]an and [[North America]]n centres.<ref name=Horizon/> On 15 May 1986, the airline went public and listed in the Main Board of the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{cite web|title=List of listed companies on Main Board|url=http://www.hkex.com.hk/data/factbook/2006/e/32.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing]]|page=225|date=2006|accessdate=2009-07-09}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref>

===The 1990s===
[[File:CX333 TPE.JPG|thumb|[[Airbus A330-300]] at [[Taipei Taoyuan International Airport]]|alt=A Cathay Pacific Airbus A330-300 at [[Chennai International Airport]]]]

In January 1990, Cathay Pacific and its parent company, [[Swire Pacific]], acquired a significant shareholding in [[Dragonair]], and a 75% stake in cargo airline [[Air Hong Kong]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|title=History - Year 1990 - 1994|url=http://www.dragonair.com/da/en_INTL/aboutus/aboutdragonair/history?refID=b1c01dfcac000110VgnVCM10000021d21c39____|publisher=[[Dragonair]]|accessdate=2009-07-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History - Air Hong Kong|url=http://www.airhongkong.com.hk/ahk/en/F300/History/index.jsp|publisher=[[Air Hong Kong]]|accessdate=2009-07-09}}</ref> During the early 1990s, the airline launched a programme to upgrade its passenger service. Also, the green and white striped livery was replaced with the current "brushwing" livery. Later, the airline began a US$9 billion fleet replacement program during the mid-1990s that resulted with it having one of the youngest airline fleets in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=History - A Change of Image|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_HK/aboutus/cxbackground/history?refID=0555b9b4b92eb010VgnVCM10000010d21c39____|publisher=Cathay Pacific|accessdate=2009-07-09}}</ref> In 1996, [[CITIC Pacific]] increased its holdings in Cathay Pacific from 10% to 25%, while the Swire Group holding was reduced to 44% as two other Chinese companies, [[China National Aviation Corporation|CNAC]] and CTS also bought substantial holdings.<ref name=hump/>

On 1 July 1997, administration of Hong Kong was transferred from the [[UK]] to the [[People's Republic of China]]. Most of the airline's aircraft were registered in Hong Kong and bore a registration beginning with "VR". Under the terms of an agreement within the [[Sino-British Joint Liaison Group]] (JLG), all registrations were changed to the prefix "B" by December 1997 , which is used by the People's Republic of China and the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yearbook.gov.hk/1997/ch15/e15v.htm|title=Hong Kong - A New Era - Civil Aviation|publisher=[[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong SAR Government]]|accessdate=2009-07-02}}</ref> Cathay Pacific aircraft formerly carried a painted Union Jack on the tail but these were removed several years prior to the 1997 takeover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.net/photo/Cathay-Pacific-Airways/Boeing-747-267B/0000646/L/|title=Cathay Pacific - Picture of the Boeing 747-267B aircraft at Vancouver|publisher=Airliners.net|accessdate=2009-05-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.net/photo/Cathay-Pacific-Airways/Boeing-747-267B/0815216/L/|publisher=Airliners.net|title=Cathay Pacific - Picture of the Boeing 747-267B aircraft at Hong Kong|accessdate=2009-05-24}}</ref>

In February 1999, Cathay Pacific co-founded the [[Oneworld]] Alliance.<ref name=OW>{{cite web|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_INTL/aboutus/cxbackground/factsheet?refID=2105cd5d499cf010VgnVCM32000011d21c39____|title=Fact Sheet - Oneworld|publisher=Cathay Pacific|accessdate=2009-07-02}}</ref> The same year, they completed their new headquarters, dubbed Cathay Pacific City, which is located at [[Hong Kong International Airport]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Cathay Pacific wins award for providing a smoke-free workplace at its Hong Kong Headquarters|publisher=Cathay Pacific|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_HK/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=cfac25318ffaa010VgnVCM22000022d21c39____|date=6 January 2005|accessdate=2009-07-02}}</ref> Previously the airline's headquarters were at the Swire House, which was a complex named after the airline's parent company.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Airline Directory|publisher=[[Flight International]]|date=30 March 1985|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%200928.html|page=68|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref> The airline was hurt by the [[Asian financial crisis]] of the late 1990s, but recorded a record [[HK$]]5 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] profit in 2000.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Cathay Pacific posts record annual profit for 2000|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_HK/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=e2ed4e786c29a010VgnVCM22000022d21c39____|publisher=Cathay Pacific|date=7 March 2001|accessdate=2009-07-02}}</ref>

===New Hong Kong airport and transpolar flights===
On 5 July 1998, [[Kai Tak Airport|Hong Kong Kai Tak Airport]] witnessed its last commercial departing flight, Cathay Pacific Flight 251 to [[London Heathrow Airport]], after over 73 years of operation. The next day, Cathay Pacific Flight 889, from [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York John F. Kennedy International Airport]], piloted by Captain Mike Lowes and First Officer Kelvin Ma, was the maiden flight to arrive at the new [[Hong Kong International Airport]], located at [[Chek Lap Kok]], west of Hong Kong.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Commemorative certificate for first-day passengers|url=http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/media/press-releases/ex_128.html|publisher=[[Airport Authority Hong Kong]]|date=5 July 1998|accessdate=2009-07-05}}</ref> This flight was also the world's first [[Non-stop flight|non-stop]] [[Polar route|transpolar]] flight from New York to Hong Kong. The flight, dubbed ''Polar One'', takes approximately 16 hours to travel between Hong Kong and New York, saving about three to four hours on journey time, compared to the one stop service via [[Vancouver]]. It is Cathay Pacific's longest non-stop flight, as well as one of the longest non-stop flights by distance in the world at {{convert|8055|mi|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name=PolarOne>{{cite press release|title=Cathay Pacific's non-stop New York flight 'strengthens Hong Kong's hub'|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_HK/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=aa24e27ed1faa010VgnVCM22000022d21c39____|publisher=Cathay Pacific|date=11 June 2004|accessdate=2009-07-05}}</ref>

The airline operated the first commercial non-stop transpolar flight from [[Canada]] on 19 May 2000, with Cathay Pacific Flight 829 from [[Toronto]] to Hong Kong. The flight flew directly over [[Hudson Bay]] and passed within {{convert|50|nmi|km mi}} of the North Pole, it took just 14 hours and 59 minutes and saved almost three hours from the normal route, which included a technical stop in [[Anchorage]]. It is Cathay Pacific's second longest non-stop flight with a distance of {{convert|7809|mi|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name=PolarYYZ>{{cite press release|title=Cathay Pacific operates first transpolar flight from Canada|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_HK/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=cfff110706caa010VgnVCM22000022d21c39____|publisher=Cathay Pacific|date=19 May 2000|accessdate=2009-07-23}}</ref>

===The 49ers - industrial troubles===
In 2001, the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association (HKAOA) launched a "work to rule" campaign to further its campaign for pay improvements and changes to roster scheduling practices. The action involved pilots refusing to work flights that were not scheduled on their roster. Although this alone did not cause extensive disruption, rostered pilots began calling in sick for their flights. Combined with the work to rule campaign, the airline was unable to cover all of its scheduled flights and cancellations resulted. Cathay Pacific steadfastly refused to negotiate with the HKAOA under threat of industrial action.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pilots' work-to-rule causing delays at Cathay Pacific|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDP/is_2001_July_9/ai_76664432/|publisher=Kyodo News International, Inc.|date=4 July 2001|accessdate=2009-09-04}}</ref>

On 9 July 2001, reportedly following a comprehensive review of the employment histories of all its pilots, the company fired 49 of its 1,500 pilots. This group became known colloquially as "the 49ers". Nearly half of the fired pilots were captains, representing five percent of the total pilot group. Of the 21 officers of the HKAOA, nine were fired, including four of the seven union negotiators.<ref name=Hopkins>{{cite web|last=Hopkins|first=George E.|title=Cathay Pacific Pilots on the Brink|url=http://www.cathaypilotsunion.org/generaldocs/USalpaarticle02.pdf|format=PDF|date=May/June 2002|publisher=Air Line Pilot|page=20|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref>

[[File:cathay b747-400 b-hua takeoff arp.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 747-400]] takes off|alt=A Cathay Pacific Boeing 747-400 taking off]]

Then-HKAOA president Captain Nigel Demery took the view that "the firing was pure intimidation, a union-bust straight up, designed to be random enough to put the fear in all pilots that they might be next, no reason given, "<ref name=Hopkins/> The dismissals were challenged in a number of legal proceedings, but none were reinstated. The airline later offered the 49 pilots it terminated in 2001 the chance to reapply for pilot positions with its cargo division, guaranteeing such applicants first interviews, subject to passing psychometric testing. Nineteen former employees applied and twelve were offered jobs.<ref>{{cite news|last=Parry|first=Simon|title=Sacked pilots win back Cathay jobs after 4-year break|url=http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showpost.php?s=21c6a887a8f684e25aeaecb446f2ed0f&p=4715707&postcount=425|date=10 July 2005|publisher=[[South China Morning Post]]|accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref>

Current relations between the company and the HKAOA are cordial. The replacement of Captain Demery by Captain Murray Gardner is said to have had a lot to do with this change in relationship. Captain Gardner favoured a more diplomatic and conciliatory approach to dealing with management, and workplace relations between the two groups have been largely conciliatory since 2002.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gardner|first=Murray|title=Formal Offer on the 49ers|url=http://www.cathaypilotsunion.org/ILO/2186RefE1-FormalOfferonthe49ers.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Cathay Pilot Union|date=16 December 2004|accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref>

On 11 November 2009, 18 of The 49ers succeeded in the Hong Kong Court of First Instance concerning their joint claims for breach of contract, breach of the Employment Ordinance and defamation.

Judge Anselmo Reyes ruled the airline had contravened the Employment Ordinance by dismissing the pilots without a valid reason, adding that they had been sacked primarily because of union activities. He also held that remarks by former director and chief operating officer Philip Chen Nanlok and chief executive Tony Tyler after the sackings were defamatory.

The judge handed the pilots a victory in their long-running legal battle,with individual awards of HK$3.3 million for defamation together with a month's pay and HK$150,000 for the sackings. The judgement is being appealed.

===Acquisition and downsizing of Dragonair===
On 9 June 2006, the airline underwent a shareholding realignment under which [[Dragonair]] became a wholly owned subsidiary but continued to operate under its own brand. By acquiring Dragonair, this meant gaining more access to the restricted, yet rapidly growing, Mainland China market and more opportunities for sharing of resources. [[China National Aviation Corporation|CNAC]], and its subsidiary, [[Air China]], acquired a 17.5 percent stake in Cathay Pacific, and the airline doubled its shareholding in Air China to 17.5 percent. [[CITIC Pacific]] reduced its shareholding to 17.5 percent and [[Swire Group]] reduced its shareholding to 40 percent.<ref name=Swire/><ref>{{cite web|title=History - Into the New Millennium|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_HK/aboutus/cxbackground/history?refID=f5b5b9b4b92eb010VgnVCM10000010d21c39____|publisher=Cathay Pacific|accessdate=2009-07-09}}</ref><ref name=KAmerge>{{cite web|title=Cathay, Air China Deal Enables Dragonair Purchase|url=http://www.btnonline.com/businesstravelnews/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002840345|publisher=Business Travel News|accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref>

Dragonair had originally planned significant international expansion. It was already operating services to [[Bangkok]] and [[Tokyo]], and was to have a dedicated cargo fleet of nine [[Boeing 747-400BCF]] aircraft by 2009 operating to [[New York City|New York]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[San Francisco]] and [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]].<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.dragonair.com/da/en_INTL/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=66cc5b81f2510110VgnVCM22000022d21c39____|title=Dragonair to more than double size of cargo fleet by end-2008|publisher=[[Dragonair]]|date=6 May 2004|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref> It had also acquired three [[Airbus A330-300]] aircraft to commence services to [[Sydney]] and [[Seoul]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.travelweekly.com.au/articles/14/0c01f914.asp|title=Dragonair gets green light for Sydney/Hong Kong services|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|work=Travel Weekly|date=19 April 2004|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref>

Following the acquisition by Cathay Pacific, Dragonair's proposed expansion plans underwent a comprehensive route compatibility analysis with the Cathay network, in an effort to reduce duplication. Dragonair services to Bangkok and Tokyo were terminated, and new services launched to Sendai, Phuket, Manila and Kathmandu. With the merging of similar departments at the two previously separate airlines, some Dragonair staff have had their employment contracts transferred to Cathay Pacific, and others made redundant due to the efficiencies gained in the merger. This has resulted in an approximately 37 percent decrease in the number of staff contractually employed by Dragonair.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dragonair.com/da/en_INTL/aboutus/aboutdragonair/fastfacts?refID=4418ebe4f0bef010VgnVCM10000021d21c39____|title=Fast Facts - Number of Staff|publisher=[[Dragonair]]|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref>

Although there has been speculation that Dragonair will cease as a brand and be fully absorbed into Cathay Pacific, this is unlikely as Dragonair enjoy significant market awareness in regional Chinese markets.<ref name=KAmerge/>

To celebrate the airline's 60th anniversary in 2006, a year of road shows named the "Cathay Pacific 60th Anniversary Skyshow" was held where the public could see the developments of the airline, play games, meet some of the airline's staff, and view vintage uniforms. Cathay Pacific also introduced anniversary merchandise and in-flight meals served by famous restaurants in Hong Kong in collaboration with the celebrations.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Cathay Pacific takes 60th Anniversary Skyshow On the road|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_HK/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=abb9f0b86b9ab010VgnVCM22000022d21c39____|publisher=Cathay Pacific|date=20 May 2006|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref>

In June 2008, Cathay Pacific entered into a [[plea bargain]] with the [[United States Department of Justice]] in respect of antitrust investigations over air cargo price fixing agreements. It was fined [[US$]]60 [[million]]. The airline has subsequently set up an internal Competition Compliance Office, reporting to Chief Operating Officer John Slosar, to ensure that the Group complies with all relevant competition and antitrust laws in the jurisdiction in which it operates. The breaches for which Cathay Pacific Cargo were being investigated in the U.S. were not illegal under Hong Kong competition law.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Major International Airlines Agree to Plead Guilty and Pay Criminal Fines Totaling More Than $500 Million for Fixing Prices on Air Cargo Rates|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/June/08-at-570.html|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]|date=26 June 2008|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|title=Announcement Plea Agreement with United States Department of Justice|url=http://downloads.cathaypacific.com/cx/investor/20080626CX_Announcement%28B%29_en.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Cathay Pacific|date=26 June 2008|accessdate=2009-09-04}}</ref>

[[File:Cathay Pacific, Boeing 747-400, SIN.jpg|thumb|left|A Cathay Pacific boeing 747-400 at [[Singapore Changi Airport]]]]

In March 2009, the airline reported a record full-year loss of [[HK$]]8.56 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] for 2008, which was also the carrier's first since the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]]. The record loss included fuel-hedging losses of HK$7.6 billion and a HK$468 million charge for a price-fixing fine in the [[United States|U.S.]] It had to scrap its final dividend. The hedging losses were a result of locking in fuel prices at higher than prevailing market price. As of the end of 2008, Cathay Pacific has hedged about half of its fuel needs until the end of 2011. The airline at the time estimated that it would face no further cash costs from the hedges if the average market price stood at US$75, enabling it recoup provisions it made in 2008.<ref name=2008loss>{{cite news|last=Leung|first=Wendy|title=Cathay Pacific to delay planes, review routes on loss|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aCGfshxczTzM|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|date=11 March 2009|accessdate=2009-08-19}}</ref>

The flattening out of fuel prices resulted in Cathay Pacific recording a paper fuel hedging gain for its half year reports for 2009. However, as a result of the global economic situation, the Group reported an operating loss. Given the current economic climate, and in line with the steps being taken by other major airlines around the world, the airline has undertaken a comprehensive review of all its routes and operations. This has resulted in frequencies being reduced to certain destinations, ad hoc cancellations on other routes, deferred capital expenditure, parked aircraft and introduced a Special Leave Scheme for staff to conserve money.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chan|first=Sue Ling|title=Cathay, Singapore Face Tough Decisions|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aVooYceFNyjc|publisher=Bloomberg L.

He noted that it could take 20 passengers in [[Economy class|economy]] to make up for the lost revenue of one fewer [[First class (aviation)|first class]] passenger flying to [[New York City|New York]] from [[Hong Kong]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Akkermans|first=Joost|last2=Leung|first2=Wendy|title=Cathay Pacific's Tyler doesn't expect recovery soon|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aX0f0iiNtAJs|publisher=Bloomberg L.

On 28 November 2002, the airline took delivery of its first [[Airbus A340-600]] aircraft at a ceremony at the [[Airbus]] factory in [[Toulouse]].

On 7 August 2007, Cathay Pacific announced that it had placed an additional order for five more wide-body Boeing 777-300ER aircraft for a total price of about [[US$]]1.4 billion, increasing its commitment to a total of 23 of the aircraft type.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Cathay Pacific Airways Orders Five Additional Boeing 777-300ERs|url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2007/q3/070807a_nr.html|publisher=[[Boeing]]|date=7 August 2007|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref> On 30 October 2007, the airline's [[CEO]], Tony Tyler, stated that the carrier has no plans regarding the purchase of either the [[Boeing 787]] or the [[Airbus A380]] for the time being.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cathay Pacific: no plans for 787 or A380|url=http://www.abcmoney.co.uk/news/302007155134.htm|publisher=ABCmoney. co. uk|date=30 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref> On 8 November 2007, the airline announced that it had placed an order for seven additional Boeing 777-300ERs and 10 747-8F freighters with a list price of US$5.2 billion.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Boeing and Cathay Pacific Announce Order for 10 747-8Fs and Seven 777-300ERs|url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2007/q4/071108c_nr.html|publisher=[[Boeing]]|date=8 November 2007|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref> In addition, it has also took 14 options for the new freighter at that time.

On 11 March 2009, it was reported that the delivery of two aircraft due in 2008 was delayed after a strike at [[Boeing]]. Additionally, the delivery of two Boeing 747-8 freighters due this year have been pushed back to 2010 amid delays at the planemaker.<ref name=2008loss/>

The delivery positions on new [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-300]] and [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-300ER]] have been deferred due to the [[Late-2000s recession|economic recession]].

On 8 June 2010, it was reported that Cathay Pacific was in talks with both Boeing and Airbus about adding the [[Boeing 787]] and/or the [[Airbus A350]] to their fleet.  Tony Tyler, Cathay Pacific's CEO, was reported to have said that the airline is more interested in acquiring smaller, long-range jets that are better suited for carrying cargo, than it is in acquiring either the [[Boeing 747-8|Boeing 747-8I]] or the [[Airbus A380]].  Acquisition of the Boeing 787 and/or the Airbus A350 would allow Cathay Pacific to both add new destinations to its network, and to replace those [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-400s]] and [[Airbus A340|Airbus A340-300s]] that currently operate on its long-haul routes alongside [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-300ERs]].<ref>http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-06-07/cathay-pacific-is-in-talks-to-purchase-long-range-jets-shuns-super-jumbos.html</ref>

Since its conception in 1946, the airline had operated many types of aircraft. The first two aircraft were two World War II surplus Douglas DC-3s named ''Betsy'' and ''Niki''. ''Betsy'' (VR-HDB), the first aircraft for Cathay Pacific, is now a permanent exhibit in the [[Hong Kong Science Museum]]. ''Niki'' (VR-HDA) was lost, but a similar DC-3 was purchased as a replacement. It was refurbished and repainted by the airline's Engineering Department and maintenance provider, [[Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company]], and it now wears the second Cathay Pacific livery from the late 1940s. This aircraft received ''Niki'''s old VR-HDA aircraft registration and is now on public view in the car park outside the Flight Training Centre of Cathay Pacific City.<ref name=DC3>{{cite press release|title=Vintage Aircraft Brings the Past Alive at Cathay Pacific Headquarter's in Airlines 60th Anniversary Year|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_NZ/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=45b8001674c7d010VgnVCM32000011d21c39____|publisher=Cathay Pacific|date=5 September 2006|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref>
