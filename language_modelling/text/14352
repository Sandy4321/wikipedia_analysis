'''Colonel Thomas de Burgh''' 1670 <U+2013> 18 December 1730), often named in his lifetime as '''Thomas Burgh''', was an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[military engineer]], [[architect]], and Member of the [[Parliament of Ireland]]. He designed a number of the large public buildings of [[Dublin]] including the old Custom House (1704<U+2013>6), [[Trinity College Library, Dublin|Trinity College Library]] (1712<U+2013>33), [[Dr Steevens' Hospital]] (1719), the Linen Hall (1722), and the [[Collins Barracks (Dublin)|Royal Barracks]] (1701 onwards).

== Early life ==

Thomas de Burgh was the son of [[Right Reverend|Rt Rev]] Ulysses Burgh (d. 1692) of Drumkeen, [[County Limerick]], who was Dean of Emly and later [[Bishop of Ardagh]]. His mother was Mary, daughter of William Kingsmill of Ballibeg, [[County Cork]]. His brothers, Richard de Burgh of Dromkeen and Drumrusk and William de Burgh of Bert were both Members of Parliament. He was descended, through [[Edmond Albanach de Burgh|Edmond de Burgh]], from [[William de Burgh]] (1135<U+2013>1206), who first settled in Ireland in 1185, becoming Justiciar. 

Thomas was educated at Delany's school in Dublin, and [[Trinity College, Dublin]], where he matriculated on 22 November 1685 and left without taking a degree. Prior to the outbreak of the [[Williamite War in Ireland|1688 wars]] he is likely to have left Ireland for London with his father. He returned to Ireland in the army of [[King William III]], as a lieutenant in [[Baron Lovelace|Lord Lovelace]]'s regiment of foot, and served at the [[Siege of Limerick]].<ref name=dia>{{cite web |url=http://www.dia.ie/architects/view/764 |title=Burgh, Thomas |work=Dictionary of Irish Architects 1720-1940 |publisher=[[Irish Architectural Archive]] |accessdate=2010-07-21}}</ref> This may have been followed by a brief spell in the Irish engineers from 1691. In any case, de Burgh was commissioned as a Captain in 1692 in the [[Royal Regiment of Foot]]. In this capacity he served in the [[Low Countries]] at the battles of [[battle of Steenkerque|Steenkerke]] (1692) and [[Battle of Landen|Landen]] (1693), and as engineer at the [[Siege of Namur (1695)|siege of Namur]] (1695). During this time, he absorbed the ideas of the Dutch engineer [[Menno van Coehoorn]] (1641<U+2013>1740).<ref name=dia/> In 1697 he became Third Engineer on the Irish establishment.<ref>Bunbury, T (2004) ''The Landed Gentry & Aristocracy of Co. Kildare''. Irish Family Names, Dublin</ref>

In 1700, de Burgh replaced the [[Surveyor General of Ireland]], [[William Robinson (architect)|William Robinson]], and one year later also became Barracks Overseer in Ireland. Under his command barrack building was expanded and the rebuilding of [[Dublin Castle]], begun under Robinson, was completed. The Royal House at [[Chapelizod]] (County Dublin) and [[Chichester House]] in Dublin were repaired as well as the numerous coastal fortifications.

As well as a Colonel of Engineers (lieutenant-colonel, 11 April 1706), de Burgh held a Captain's commission in Brasier's regiment of foot from 1707 to 1714.

== Public life ==

In 1704 Burgh was admitted as a [[freeman]] of the city of Dublin in recognition of his work in enriching Dublin's architecture. He was later admitted to the [[Dublin Philosophical Society]]. He served as [[Naas (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Member of Parliament for Naas]] from 1713 to 1730 and as a government minister. He was appointed High Sheriff of [[County Kildare]] in 1712, Governor of the [[Royal Hospital Kilmainham]] in 1707 and served as a Trustee of St Steven's Hospital from 1717- 1730.

From 1705 to 1714 he was Lieutenant of Ordnance for Ireland,<ref name=dia/> an appointment which, held with that of Surveyor General, made him the most influential officer in the Irish Ordnance. In this role he was responsible for overseeing the construction and renovation of all military buildings in Ireland as well as other public works. De Burgh had his commission successivley renewed over the twenty seven years following his appointment as Surveyor General in 1700.

== Architect ==
De Burgh was responsible for the design of several public buildings in Dublin:
* Custom House (1704<U+2013>6), (replaced by [[James Gandon]]'s [[The Custom House|Custom House]] in 1791)
* [[Trinity College Library, Dublin|Trinity College Library]] (1712<U+2013>33)
* [[Dr Steevens' Hospital]] (1719)
* Linen Hall (1722)
* [[Collins Barracks (Dublin)|Royal Barracks]] (1701 onwards)
* the Armoury, [[Dublin Castle]]
* Ballyburley House

Burgh was also responsible for the building of several churches, including St Mary's and [[St Werburgh's Church, Dublin|St Werburgh's]] (1715). He is known to have built a number of private houses, most of which no longer exist, including the O'Brien family house at Dromoland, [[County Clare]], in about 1719. 

His own country house at Oldtown near [[Naas]], [[County Kildare]], was the only building into which he introduced [[Palladian]] ideas. He acquired the land in 1696 and the house was built thirteen years later. His architectural style was otherwise "restrained" and notable mainly for massing on different planes, using a central five-bay front crowned by a large pediment, and arcading on the ground floor. Oldtown remained the family home, although a fire destroyed the original main house and a wing in the 1950s.<ref>Rolf Loeber, "Burgh, Thomas (1670<U+2013>1730)", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', online edn, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004</ref>

He worked on several engineering projects, including improvements to Dublin Harbour and the proposed [[Newry Canal]], although this was not built until after his death.<ref name=dia/> Burgh published a pamphlet entitled "A method to determine the areas of right-lined figures universally, very useful for ascertaining the contents of any survey" (Dublin, 1724). 

In 1728 de Burgh lost the commission to build the new [[Irish Houses of Parliament|Parliament House]] in Dublin to [[Edward Lovett Pearce]] (1699<U+2013>1733), who succeeded de Burgh as Surveyor General on his death, after an illness, in 1730.<ref name=dia/>

== Family ==

Burgh was married to Mary, a daughter of [[Right Reverend|Rt Rev]] William Smyth, [[Bishop of Kilmore]], on 10 July 1700. They had five sons and four daughters. His town house was in Dawson Street (now rebuilt) and his country estate was Oldtown in County Kildare. He also owned lucrative collieries in [[County Antrim]].

He was succeeded as MP for Naas by his eldest son, Thomas de Burgh (1707<U+2013>1759). His other children were:<ref>Burke, E. (1912) ''Landed Gentry of Ireland'', London</ref>
