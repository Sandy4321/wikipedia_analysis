[[File:Boston 1772.png|thumb|left|Boston in 1772, compared with Boston in 1880]]
Boston was founded on September 17, 1630, by [[Puritan]] colonists from England.<ref name="history"/> The Puritans of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] are sometimes confused with the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]], who founded [[Plymouth Colony]] ten years earlier in what is today [[Bristol County, Massachusetts|Bristol County]], [[Plymouth County, Massachusetts|Plymouth County]], and [[Barnstable County, Massachusetts]]. The two groups, which differed in religious practice, are historically distinct. The separate colonies were not united until the formation of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] in 1691.

The [[Shawmut Peninsula]] was connected to the mainland by a narrow [[isthmus]] and was surrounded by the waters of [[Massachusetts Bay]] and the Back Bay, an [[estuary]] of the [[Charles River]]. Several prehistoric [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] archaeological sites that were excavated in the city have shown that the peninsula was inhabited as early as 5000 BC.<ref>

Boston's early European settlers first called the area ''Trimountaine'', but later [[List of locations in the United States with an English name|renamed the town after]] [[Boston, Lincolnshire]], England, from which several prominent colonists had emigrated. [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]'s original governor, [[John Winthrop]], gave a famous sermon entitled "[[City upon a Hill|A Model of Christian Charity]]", popularly known as the "City on a Hill" sermon, which espoused the idea that Boston had a special covenant with God. (Winthrop also led the signing of the [[Cambridge Agreement]], which is regarded as a key founding document of the city.) Puritan ethics molded a stable and well-structured society in Boston. For example, shortly after Boston's settlement, Puritans founded America's first public school, [[Boston Latin School]] (1635).<ref name="BPS" /> Between 1636 and 1698, six major [[smallpox]] epidemics in Boston had caused a substantial number of deaths.<ref>"[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2008&page=24 Emerging Infections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United States (1992)]".

In the 1770s, British attempts to exert more-stringent control on the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen colonies]]<U+2014>primarily via taxation<U+2014>led to the [[American Revolution]].<ref name="history"/>
The [[Boston Massacre]], the [[Boston Tea Party]], and several early battles<U+2014>including the [[Battle of Lexington and Concord]], the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], and the [[Siege of Boston]]<U+2014>occurred in or near the city. During this period, [[Paul Revere]] made his famous midnight ride. After the Revolution, Boston had become one of the world's wealthiest international trading ports because of the city's consolidated seafaring tradition.  Exports included rum, fish, salt, and tobacco.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.universityarchives.com/browse.asp?sn=39159-001&show=True&thumbnails=True |title=Colonial Boston |accessdate=2009-05-02 |publisher=University Archives}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> During this era, descendants of old Boston families were regarded as the nation's social and cultural elites; they were later dubbed the ''[[Boston Brahmin]]s''.<ref name="US History">{{cite web |url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3865.html |title=Boston, Massachusetts |accessdate=2009-05-02 |publisher=U-S-History.com}}</ref>

The [[Embargo Act of 1807]], adopted during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the [[War of 1812]] significantly curtailed Boston's harbor activity. Although foreign trade returned after these hostilities, Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital investments in the interim. Manufacturing became an important component of the city's economy, and by the mid-19th century, the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance. Until the early 20th century, Boston remained one of the nation's largest manufacturing centers and was notable for its [[Clothing|garment]] production and [[leather]]-goods industries.<ref name="economy"/>
A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region made for easy shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads facilitated the region's industry and commerce. From the mid-19th to late 19th century, Boston flourished culturally.  It became renowned for its rarefied literary culture and lavish artistic patronage. It also became a center of the [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement.<ref>

[[File:Boston-view-1841-Havell.jpeg|thumb|left|View of Boston from [[Dorchester Heights]], 1841]]

In the 1820s, Boston's population began to swell, and the city's ethnic composition changed dramatically with the first wave of European [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]]. Irish immigrants dominated the first wave of newcomers during this period. By 1850, about 35,000 [[Irish people|Irish]] lived in Boston.<ref>

Between 1631 and 1890, the city tripled its physical size by [[land reclamation]]<U+2014>by filling in marshes, mud flats, and gaps between wharves along the waterfront<ref>

Beginning in 1807, the crown of Beacon Hill was used to fill in a 50-[[acre]] (20&nbsp;[[hectare|ha]]) mill pond that later became the [[Haymarket Square (Boston)|Haymarket Square]] area. The present-day [[Massachusetts State House|State House]] sits atop this lowered Beacon Hill. Reclamation projects in the middle of the century created significant parts of the [[South End, Boston|South End]], the [[West End, Boston|West End]], the [[Financial District, Boston|Financial District]], and [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]]. After [[Great Boston Fire of 1872|The Great Boston Fire of 1872]], workers used building rubble as landfill along the downtown waterfront. During the mid-to-late 19th century, workers filled almost 600&nbsp;acres (2.4&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of brackish Charles River marshlands west of [[Boston Common]] with gravel brought by rail from the hills of Needham Heights. Also, the city annexed the adjacent towns of [[South Boston]] (1804), [[East Boston]] (1836), [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] (1868), [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] (including present day [[Mattapan, Massachusetts|Mattapan]] and a portion of [[South Boston]]) (1870), [[Brighton, Massachusetts|Brighton]] (including present day [[Allston, Boston|Allston]]) (1874), [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts|West Roxbury]] (including present day [[Jamaica Plain, Boston|Jamaica Plain]] and [[Roslindale, Boston|Roslindale]]) (1874), [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] (1874), and [[Hyde Park, Boston|Hyde Park]] (1912).<ref>{{cite book |title=Historical Atlas of Massachusetts |page=37 |year=1991 |publisher=University of Massachusetts}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Holleran |first1=Michael |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Boston's Changeful Times: Origins of Preservation and Planning in America |trans_title= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=j_L08ikdUrkC |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=August 22, 2010 |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=2001 |month= |origyear= |publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]] |location= |isbn=0-8018-6644-8 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=Pg. 41 |pages= |at= |trans_chapter= |chapter=Problems with Change |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=j_L08ikdUrkC&lpg=PA41&ots=29xS9xlq3c&pg=PA39#v=onepage&f=false |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}</ref> Other proposals, for the annexation of  [[Brookline-Boston annexation debate of 1873|Brookline]], Cambridge,<ref>{{cite news |title=BOSTON'S ANNEXATION SCHEMES.; PROPOSAL TO ABSORB CAMBRIDGE AND OTHER NEAR-BY TOWNS |author=Staff writer |first= |last= |authorlink= |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C05E1DC1F39E233A25754C2A9659C94639ED7CF |agency= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=March 26, 1892, Wednesday |page= 11 |pages= |at= |accessdate=August 21, 2010 |language= |trans_title= |quote= |archiveurl=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C05E1DC1F39E233A25754C2A9659C94639ED7CF |archivedate=March 27, 1892 |ref= }}</ref> and Chelsea,<ref>{{cite news |title=Has the time for Chelsea's annexation to Boston come?

By the early and mid-20th century, the city was in decline as factories became old and obsolete, and businesses moved out of the region for cheaper labor elsewhere.<ref name="history"/>
Boston responded by initiating various [[urban renewal]] projects under the direction of the [[Boston Redevelopment Authority]] (BRA), which was established in 1957. In 1958, BRA initiated a project to improve the historic West End neighborhood. Extensive demolition was met with vociferous public opposition.<ref>
{{cite news |author=Collins, Monica |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2005/08/07/born_again/ |title=Born Again |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=August 7, 2005 |accessdate=2007-05-08}}
</ref>
BRA subsequently reevaluated its approach to urban renewal in its future projects, including the construction of [[Government Center, Boston|Government Center]]. In 1965, the first [[Community Health Center]] in the United States opened, the Columbia Point Health Center, in the [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] neighborhood. It mostly served the massive [[Columbia Point (Boston)|Columbia Point]] public housing complex adjoining it, which was built in 1953. The health center is still in operation and was rededicated in 1990 as the Geiger-Gibson Community Health Center.<ref>

By the 1970s, the city's economy boomed after 30 years of economic downturn. A large number of high rises were constructed in the [[Financial District, Boston|Financial District]] and in Boston's [[Back Bay]] during this time period. This boom continued into the mid-1980s and later began again. Boston now has the second largest skyline in the Northeast (after New York) in terms of the number of buildings reaching a height of over {{convert|500|ft|m}}.  Hospitals such as [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], and [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] lead the nation in medical innovation and patient care. Schools such as [[Boston University]], the [[Harvard Medical School]], [[Northeastern University]], and [[Boston Conservatory]] attract students to the area. Nevertheless, the city experienced conflict starting in 1974 over [[desegregation busing]], which resulted in unrest and violence around public schools throughout the mid-1970s. In 1984, the City of Boston gave control of the Columbia Point public housing complex to a private developer, who redeveloped and revitalized the property from its rundown and dangerous state into an attractive residential mixed-income community called Harbor Point Apartments, which opened in 1988 and was completed by 1990. It was the first federal housing project to be converted to private, mixed-income housing in the United States, and served as a model for the federal [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]] [[HOPE VI]] public housing revitalization program that began in 1992.<ref name="Roessner">
Cf. Roessner, p.293. "The HOPE VI housing program, inspired in part by the success of Harbor Point, was created by legislation passed by Congress in 1992."

==Geography==
[[File:Boston Landsat.jpg|thumb|left|Simulated-color satellite image of the Boston area taken on [[NASA]]'s [[Landsat 3]]]]

Owing to its early founding, Boston is very compact.  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 89.6&nbsp;square miles (232.1&nbsp;km<U+00B2>)<U+2014>48.4&nbsp;square miles (125.4&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) (54.0%) of land and 41.2&nbsp;square miles (106.7&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) (46.0%) of water. Boston is the country's [[List of United States cities by population density|fourth most densely populated]] city that is not a part of a larger city's [[metropolitan area]].<ref>After New York City, San Francisco, and Chicago. Many cities, such as [[Paterson, New Jersey]], are denser but are part of a larger city's metropolitan area.</ref> This is largely attributable to the [[History of Boston, Massachusetts#Geographic expansion|rarity of annexation]] by [[New England town]]s.  Of United States cities with more than 600,000 people, only [[San Francisco]] is smaller in land area. Boston is surrounded by the "[[Greater Boston]]" region and is bordered by the [[New England town|cities and towns]] of [[Winthrop, Massachusetts|Winthrop]], [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]], [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]], [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]], [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]], [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]], [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]], [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]], and [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]]. The [[Charles River]] separates Boston proper from Cambridge, Watertown, and the neighborhood of Charlestown. To the east lies [[Boston Harbor]] and the [[Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area]] (BHINRA), which includes part of the city's territory, specifically [[Calf Island]], [[Gallops Island]], [[Great Brewster Island]], [[Green Island]], [[Little Brewster Island]], [[Little Calf Island]], [[Long Island]], [[Lovells Island]], [[Middle Brewster Island]], [[Nixes Mate]], [[Outer Brewster Island]], [[Rainsford Island]], [[Shag Rocks]], [[Spectacle Island (Massachusetts)|Spectacle Island]], [[The Graves]], and [[Thompson Island]].

===Neighborhoods===
{{Main|Neighborhoods in Boston}}

Boston is sometimes called a "city of neighborhoods" because of the profusion of diverse subsections.  There are 21 official neighborhoods in Boston used by the city.<ref>Official [[List of Boston neighborhoods|Boston neighborhoods]], defined here [http://www.cityofboston.gov/neighborhoods/default.asp].</ref>  These neighborhoods include: [[Allston, Massachusetts|Allston]]/[[Brighton, Massachusetts|Brighton]], [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]], [[Bay Village, Boston, Massachusetts|Bay Village]], [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]], [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]], [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]]/[[Leather District, Boston|Leather District]], [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]], Downtown/[[Financial District, Boston|Financial District]], [[East Boston]], [[Fenway-Kenmore|Fenway/Kenmore]], [[Hyde Park, Boston|Hyde Park]], [[Jamaica Plain, Boston|Jamaica Plain]], [[Mattapan]], [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]], [[North End, Boston|North End]], [[Roslindale, Boston|Roslindale]], [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]], [[South Boston]], [[South End, Boston|South End]], [[West End, Boston|West End]], and [[West Roxbury, Boston|West Roxbury]].

===Climate===

Boston has a climate that is [[continental climate|continental]] in nature but with maritime influences owing to its coastal location, a phenomenon common to coastal southern New England. The climate is classified as either [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] or [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] ([[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification|Koppen]] ''Dfa'', ''Cfa'' respectively). Summers are typically warm, rainy, and humid, while winters are cold, windy, and snowy. Spring and autumn are usually mild, but conditions are widely varied, depending on wind direction and jet stream positioning. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore affect Boston, minimizing the influence of the [[Atlantic|Atlantic Ocean]].

[[File:USA Massachusetts Boston Foliage.jpg|thumb|left|Boston's skyline in the background, with [[Autumn leaf color|fall foliage]] in the foreground]]

The hottest month is July, with a mean temperature of {{convert|73.9|F|1}}. The coldest month is January, with a mean of {{convert|29.3|F|1}}. Periods exceeding {{convert|90|<U+00B0>F|0}} in summer and below {{convert|10|<U+00B0>F|0}} in winter are not uncommon but rarely extended, with about 14 days per year seeing the former extreme,<ref name = NCDC /> and the most recent subzero reading occurring on January 22, 2005.<ref name = "Boston Extremes" /> <!-- from template --> Extremes have ranged from {{convert|<U+2212>18|to|104|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|0}}, recorded on February 9, 1934 and July 4, 1911, respectively.<ref name = "Boston Extremes" />

Fog is prevalent, particularly in spring and early summer, and the occasional tropical storm or [[hurricane]] can threaten the region, especially in early autumn. Due to its situation along the North Atlantic, the city is often subjected to [[sea breeze]], especially in the late spring, when water temperatures are still quite cold and temperatures at the coast can be more than {{convert|20|F-change|0|abbr=on}} colder than a few miles inland, sometimes dropping by that amount near midday.<ref>

From May to September, the city experiences [[thunderstorm]]s that are occasionally severe; large [[hail]], damaging [[wind]]s and heavy downpours accompany such severe events. Although downtown Boston has never been stuck by a violent [[tornado]], the city itself has seen its fair share of [[tornado warning]]s, but damaging storms are more common to areas north, west, and northwest of the city.

===Crime===
[[File:BPDHeadquarters.JPG|thumb|right|Headquarters of the [[Boston Police Department]]]]
The city has seen a great reduction in violent [[crime]] since the early 1990s. Boston's low crime rate over the past decade or so has been credited to the [[Boston Police Department]]'s collaboration with neighborhood groups and church parishes to prevent youths from joining gangs, as well as involvement from the [[United States Attorney]] and [[District Attorney]]'s offices. This helped lead in part to what has been touted as the "Boston Miracle". Murders in the city dropped from 152 in 1990 (for a murder rate of 26.5 per 100,000 people) to just 31<U+2014>not one of them a juvenile<U+2014>in 1999 (for a murder rate of 5.26 per 100,000).<ref name="End of a Miracle">{{cite web |author=Winship, Christopher |month=March |year=2002 |url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/soc/faculty/winship/End_of_a_Miracle.pdf |format=PDF |title=End of a Miracle? |publisher=Harvard University |accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref>

In the first decade of the 21st century, however, the annual murder count has fluctuated by as much as 50% compared with the year before, with 60 murders in 2002, followed by just 39 in 2003, 64 in 2004, and 75 in 2005. Although the figures are nowhere near the high-water mark set in 1990, the aberrations in the murder rate have been unsettling for many Bostonians and have prompted discussion over whether the Boston Police Department should reevaluate its approach to fighting crime.<ref name="End of a Miracle"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/police/ore.asp |title=Boston Police Department's Monthly Crime Statistics |year=2005 |publisher=CityOfBoston.gov |accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://boston.areaconnect.com/crime1.htm |title=Boston MA Crime Statistics (2004 <U+2013> New Crime Data) |year=2007 |publisher=areaConnect.com |accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref>

Boston is also one of the birthplaces of the [[hardcore punk]] genre of music. Boston musicians have contributed significantly to this music scene over the years (''see also [[Boston hardcore]]''). Boston neighborhoods were home to one of the leading local [[third wave ska]] and [[ska punk]] scenes in the 1990s, led by bands such as [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]] and [[The Allstonians]]. The 1980s' hardcore punk-rock compilation ''[[This Is Boston, Not L.A.]]'' highlights some of the bands that built the genre. Several nightclubs, such as [[The Channel (nightclub)|The Channel]], Bunnratty's in [[Allston, Massachusetts|Allston]], and [[The Rathskeller]], were renowned for showcasing both local punk-rock bands and those from farther afield. All of these clubs are now closed.

Boston has been a noted religious center from its earliest days.  The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston]] serves nearly 300 parishes and is based in the [[Cathedral of the Holy Cross]] (1875) in the South End, while the [[Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts]], with the [[Cathedral Church of St. Paul, Boston|Cathedral Church of St. Paul]] (1819) as its episcopal seat, serves just under 200 congregations.  Two [[Protestant]] faiths are headquartered in Boston: [[Unitarian Universalist Association|Unitarian Universalism]], with its headquarters on Beacon Hill, and the [[Church of Christ, Scientist|Christian Scientists]], headquartered in Back Bay at the [[The First Church of Christ, Scientist|Mother Church]] (1894).  The oldest church in Boston is [[King's Chapel]], the city's first Anglican church, founded in 1686 and converted to Unitarianism in 1785.  Other notable churches include Christ Church (better known as [[Old North Church]], 1723), the oldest church building in the city, [[Trinity Church, Boston|Trinity Church]] (1733), [[Park Street Church]] (1809), [[First Church in Boston]] (congregation founded 1630, building raised 1868), [[Old South Church]] (1874), and [[Mission Hill]]'s [[Basilica and Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help]] (1878).

[[Logan International Airport]], located in the [[East Boston, Massachusetts|East Boston]] neighborhood, handles most of the [[scheduled air transport|scheduled passenger service]] for Boston.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.massport.com/logan/about.asp |title=About Logan |year=2007 |publisher=Massport |accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref> Surrounding the city are three major [[general aviation]] relievers: [[Beverly Municipal Airport]] to the north, [[Hanscom Field]] in [[Bedford, Massachusetts|Bedford]], to the west, and [[Norwood Memorial Airport]] to the south. [[T. F.
