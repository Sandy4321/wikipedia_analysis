'''''The Wall''''' is the eleventh studio album by English [[progressive rock]] group [[Pink Floyd]]. Released as a [[double album]] on 30&nbsp;November 1979, it was subsequently performed live with elaborate theatrical effects, and adapted into a feature film, ''[[Pink Floyd<U+2014>The Wall]]''.

As with the band's previous three LPs, ''The Wall'' is a [[concept album]] and deals largely with themes of abandonment and personal isolation. It was first conceived during their 1977 [[In the Flesh Tour]], when bassist and lyricist [[Roger Waters]]'s frustration with the spectators' perceived boorishness became so acute that he imagined building a wall between the performers and audience. The album is a [[rock opera]] that centres on Pink, a character Waters modelled after himself, with some aspects based on the band's original leader, [[Syd Barrett]].  Pink's life experiences begin with the loss of his father during the [[World War II|Second World War]], and continue with ridicule and [[abuse]] from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother and finally, the breakdown of his marriage. All contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, represented by a metaphorical wall.

''The Wall'' features a notably harsher and more theatrical style than Pink Floyd's previous releases. Keyboardist [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] left the band during the album's production but remained as a salaried musician, performing with Pink Floyd during [[The Wall Tour|''The Wall'' Tour]]. Commercially successful upon its release, the album was one of the best selling of 1980, and as of 1999, it had sold over 23 million RIAA certified units (11.5 million albums) in the United States. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine placed ''The Wall'' at number 87 on its list of ''[[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]''.

==Background==
Pink Floyd's [[In the Flesh Tour]] was their first playing in large stadiums, and in July 1977<U+2014>on the final date at the [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Montreal Olympic Stadium]]<U+2014>a small group of noisy and excited fans near the stage irritated Waters to such an extent that he spat at one of them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scarfe|2010|p=51}}</ref>  He was not the only band member who felt disaffected at the show, as guitarist [[David Gilmour]] refused to perform the band's usual [[twelve-bar blues]] encore.<ref name="Masonpp235236">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=235<U+2013>236}}</ref>  Later that night, while returning from hospital to treat an injury sustained to his foot while play-fighting backstage with manager [[Steve O'Rourke]], Waters spoke with music producer [[Bob Ezrin]], and a friend of Ezrin's, a psychiatrist sharing their car, about the feelings of alienation he was experiencing on the tour. He articulated his desire to isolate himself by constructing a wall across the stage between the performers and the audience.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=256<U+2013>257}}</ref> He later said, "I loathed playing in stadiums ... I kept saying to people on that tour, 'I'm not really enjoying this ... there is something very wrong with this.'"<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=257}}</ref> While Gilmour and Wright were in [[France]] recording solo albums, and [[Nick Mason]] was busy producing [[Steve Hillage]]'s ''[[Green (Steve Hillage album)|Green]]'', Waters began to write new material.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=258}}</ref> The spitting incident became the starting point for a new concept, which explored the protagonist's self-imposed isolation after years of traumatic interactions with authority figures and the loss of his father as a young child. To execute ''The Wall'' concept was to attempt to analyse the performer's psychological separation from the audience, using a physical structure as a metaphorical and theatrical device.<ref name="Masonpp235236"/>

In July 1978 the band reconvened at [[Britannia Row Studios]], where Waters presented two new ideas for concept albums.  The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title ''Bricks in the Wall''.<ref name="BLAKE259">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=259}}</ref> The second, a project about a man's dreams across one night that dealt with marriage, sex, and the pros and cons of monogamy and family life versus promiscuity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=305}}</ref> The first option was chosen by the group for the new Pink Floyd project and the second idea eventually became Waters's first solo effort, a concept album titled, ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]''.<ref name="BLAKE259"/>

By September, the band were experiencing financial difficulties.<ref name="Blakepp258259">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=258<U+2013>259}}</ref> Financial planners Norton Warburg Group (NWG) had invested <U+00A3>1.3<U+2013>3.3 million (up to <U+00A3>{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK|3300000|1978|r=-3}}}} in contemporary value{{Inflation-fn|UK}}) of the group's money in high-risk [[venture capital]] to reduce their [[Taxation in the United Kingdom|tax liabilities]]. The strategy failed as many of the businesses NWG invested in lost money, leaving the band facing tax rates potentially as high as 83 per cent. Pink Floyd terminated their relationship with NWG, demanding the return of uninvested funds.<ref name="Schaffnerpp206208">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=206<U+2013>208}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Pink Floyd eventually sued NWG for <U+00A3>1M, accusing them of fraud and negligence. NWG collapsed in 1981. [[Andrew Warburg]] fled to Spain, Norton Warburg Investments (a part of NWG) was renamed to Waterbrook, and many of its holdings were sold at a loss. Andrew Warburg was jailed for three years upon his return to the UK in 1987.<ref name="Schaffnerpp206208"/>|group="nb"}} The band thus urgently needed to produce an album to make money. Because the project's 26 tracks presented a challenge greater than the band's previous albums, "Waters decided to bring in an outside producer and collaborator."<ref name="BLAKE259"/> He later said, "I needed a collaborator who was musically and intellectually in a similar place to where I was." <ref name="Blake 2008 260">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=260}}</ref>

At the suggestion of Waters's then-girlfriend, Carolyne Christie, who had worked as Ezrin's secretary, the band hired him to co-produce the album.<ref name="Blakepp258259"/> He had worked with [[Alice Cooper]], [[Lou Reed]] and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and he produced [[Peter Gabriel]]'s debut solo album.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fitch|Mahon|2006|p=25}}</ref> From the start, Waters left Ezrin in no doubt as to who was in charge: "You can write anything you want. Just don't expect any credit".<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=212}}</ref>  Ezrin, Waters, and Gilmour read Waters's concept, keeping what they liked, and discarding what they thought was not good enough. Waters and Ezrin worked mostly on the story, improving the concept.<ref name="Schaffnerpp211213">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=211<U+2013>213}}</ref>  His 40-page script was presented to the rest of the band, with positive results: "The next day at the studio, we had a table read, like you would with a play, but with the whole of the band, and their eyes all twinkled, because then they could see the album."<ref name="Blake 2008 260"/>  He broadened the storyline, distancing it from the autobiographical work Waters had written, and instead basing it on a composite, or ''gestalt'' character named Pink.<ref name="Blakepp260261">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=260<U+2013>261}}</ref> Engineer Nick Griffiths later said of the Canadian producer: "Ezrin was very good in ''The Wall'', because he did manage to pull the whole thing together. He's a very forceful guy. There was a lot of argument about how it should sound between Roger and Dave, and he bridged the gap between them."<ref name="Schaffnerp213"/> Waters wrote most of the album's material, with Gilmour sharing credit on "Comfortably Numb", "Run Like Hell", and "Young Lust",<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=278}}</ref> and Ezrin co-writing "The Trial".<ref name="Schaffnerpp211213"/>

==Concept and storyline==
''The Wall'' is a rock opera<ref>{{Citation | title = Rock Milestones: Pink Floyd <U+2013> The Wall | url = http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/383755/Rock-Milestones-Pink-Floyd-The-Wall/overview | publisher = nytimes.com | accessdate =30 May 2010}}; {{Citation | title = Pink Floyd's Roger Waters Announces The Wall Tour | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1635892/20100412/pink_floyd.jhtml | publisher = mtv.com | accessdate =30 May 2010}}; {{Citation | title = Top 14 Greatest Rock Operas/Concept Albums Of All Time | url = http://music.ign.com/articles/706/706219p4.html | publisher = ign.com | accessdate =30 May 2010}}</ref> that explores abandonment and isolation, symbolised by a metaphorical wall. The songs create an approximate storyline of events in the life of the protagonist, Pink, a character based on Waters,<ref>{{Harvnb|Scarfe|2010|p=57}}</ref> whose father was killed during the Second World War. Pink is oppressed by his overprotective mother, and tormented at school by tyrannical, abusive teachers. Each of these [[psychological trauma|traumas]] become metaphorical "bricks in the wall". The protagonist eventually becomes a rock star, his relationships marred by infidelity, drug use, and outbursts of violence. As his marriage crumbles, he finishes building his wall, completing his isolation from human contact.<ref name="Blakepp260261"/><ref name="Schaffnerpp210211">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=210<U+2013>211}}</ref>

Hidden behind his wall, Pink's crisis escalates, culminating in an hallucinatory on-stage performance where he believes that he is a [[fascist]] [[dictator]] performing at concerts similar to [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] rallies, at which he sets men on fans he considers unworthy.<ref name="Schaffnerpp210211"/>  Tormented with guilt, he places himself on trial, his inner judge ordering him to "tear down the wall", opening Pink to the outside world. The album turns full circle with its closing words "Isn't this where...", the first words of the phrase that begins the album, "...we came in?", with a continuation of the melody of the last song hinting at the cyclical nature of Waters' theme.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fitch|Mahon|2006|pp=71, 113}}</ref>

The album includes several references to former band member [[Syd Barrett]], including "[[Nobody Home]]", which hints at his condition during Pink Floyd's abortive US tour of 1967, with lyrics such as "wild, staring eyes", "Hendrix perm" and "Gohills Boots". "[[Comfortably Numb]]" was inspired by Waters's injection with a [[muscle relaxant]] to combat the effects of [[hepatitis]]  during the In the Flesh Tour, while in Philadelphia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=274}}</ref>

==Recording==
The album was recorded in several locations. In France, Super Bear Studios was used between January and July&nbsp;1979, with Waters recording his vocals at the nearby [[Studio Miraval]]. [[Michael Kamen]] supervised the orchestral arrangements at [[CBS 30th Street Studio|CBS Studios]] in [[New York]], in September. Over the next two months the band used [[Cherokee Studios]] and [[The Village (studio)|The Village Recorder]] in [[Los Angeles]]. A plan to work with the [[Beach Boys]] at the Sundance Productions studio in Los Angeles was cancelled. For a week in November they worked at the Producers Workshop, also in Los Angeles.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=232}}</ref>

[[James Guthrie (record producer)|James Guthrie]], recommended by previous Floyd collaborator [[Alan Parsons]], arrived early in the production process.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fitch|Mahon|2006|p=26}}</ref> He replaced [[Audio engineering|engineer]] Brian Humphries, emotionally drained by his five years with the band.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=238}}</ref>  Guthrie was hired as a co-producer, but was initially unaware of Ezrin's role: "I saw myself as a hot young ''producer''&nbsp;...&nbsp;When we arrived, I think we both felt we'd been booked to do the same job."<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=262}}</ref>  The early sessions at Britannia Row were emotionally charged, as Ezrin, Guthrie and Waters each had strong ideas about the direction the album would take. Relations within the band were at a low ebb, and Ezrin's role expanded to that of an intermediary between Waters and the rest of the band.<ref name="Blakep263">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=263}}</ref>  As Britannia Row was initially regarded as inadequate for ''The Wall'' the band upgraded much of its equipment,<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=240}}</ref> and by March another set of demos were complete. However, their former relationship with NWG placed them at risk of bankruptcy, and they were advised to leave the UK by no later than 6&nbsp;April 1979, for a minimum of one year. As [[tax exile|non-residents they would pay no UK taxes]] during that time, and within a month all four members and their families had left. Waters moved to Switzerland, Mason to France, and Gilmour and Wright to the [[List of islands of Greece|Greek Islands]]. Some equipment from Britannia Row was relocated in Super Bear Studios near [[Nice]].<ref name="Schaffnerp213">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=213}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=262<U+2013>263}}</ref>  Gilmour and Wright were each familiar with the studio and enjoyed its atmosphere, having recorded there during the production of their solo albums. While Wright and Mason lived at the studio, Waters and Gilmour stayed in nearby houses. Mason later moved into Waters's villa near [[Vence]], while Ezrin stayed in Nice.<ref name="Masonpp243244">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=243<U+2013>244}}</ref>

{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center|quote=The rest of the band's children were young enough to stay with them in France but mine were older and had to go to school. I was missing my children terribly.|source=Richard Wright<ref name="Blakep267"/>|align=right|width=33%}}

Ezrin's poor punctuality caused problems with the tight schedule dictated by Waters.<ref name="Blakep264">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=264}}</ref> Mason found the producer's behaviour "erratic", but used his elaborate and unlikely excuses for his lateness as ammunition for "tongue-in-cheek resentment".<ref name="Masonpp243244"/>  Ezrin's share of the royalties was less than the rest of the band and he viewed Waters as a "[[bullying|bully]]", especially when the bassist mocked him by having badges made that read NOPE (No Points Ezrin), alluding to his lesser share of the album's royalties.<ref name="Blakep264"/>  Ezrin later admitted that he had marital problems and was not "in the best shape emotionally".<ref name="Blakep264"/>

More problems became apparent when Waters's relationship with Wright broke down. The band were rarely in the studio together. Ezrin and Guthrie spliced Mason's previously recorded drum tracks together, and Guthrie also worked with Waters and Gilmour during the day, returning at night to record Wright's contributions. Wright, worried about the effect that the introduction of Ezrin would have on the band's internal relationships, was keen to have a producer's credit on the album (their albums up to that point had always stated "Produced by Pink Floyd").<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=265}}</ref>  Waters agreed to a trial period with Wright producing, after which he was to be given a producer's credit, but after a few weeks he and Ezrin expressed dissatisfaction with the keyboardist's methods. A confrontation with Ezrin led to Wright working only at nights. Gilmour also expressed his annoyance, complaining that Wright's lack of input was "driving us all mad",<ref name="Blakep266">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=266}}</ref> and Ezrin later reflected "<U+2026>&nbsp;it sometimes felt that Roger was setting him up to fail. Rick gets performance anxiety. You have to leave him alone to freeform, to create&nbsp;<U+2026>"<ref name="Blakep266"/>  Wright had his own problems, a failing marriage and the onset of depression, exacerbated by his non-residency. The band's holidays were booked for August, after which they were to reconvene at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles, but [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] offered the band a better deal in exchange for a Christmas release of the album. Waters therefore increased the band's workload accordingly; booking time at the nearby Studio Miraval.<ref name="Masonp245">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=245}}</ref>  He also suggested recording in Los Angeles ten days earlier than agreed, and hiring another keyboardist to work alongside Wright, whose keyboard parts had not yet been recorded. Wright, however, refused to cut short his family holiday in [[Rhodes]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=264<U+2013>267}}</ref>

Accounts of Wright's subsequent departure from the band differ. In his autobiography, [[Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd|''Inside Out'']], Mason says that Waters called O'Rourke, who was travelling to the US on the ''[[QE2]]'', and told him to have Wright out of the band by the time Waters arrived in LA to mix the album.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=246}}</ref>  In another version recorded by a later historian of the band, Waters called O'Rourke and asked him to tell Wright about the new recording arrangements, to which Wright allegedly responded "Tell Roger to fuck off&nbsp;<U+2026>".<ref name="Blakep267">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=267}}</ref>  Wright disagreed with this recollection, stating that the band had agreed to record only through the spring and early summer, and that he had no idea they were so far behind schedule. Mason later wrote that Waters was "stunned and furious",<ref name="Masonp245"/> and felt that Wright was not doing enough to help complete the album.<ref name="Masonp245"/>  Gilmour was on holiday in Dublin when he learnt of Waters's ultimatum, and tried to calm the situation. He later spoke with Wright and gave him his support, but reminded him about his minimal contribution to the album.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simmons|1999|p=88}}</ref>  Waters, however, insisted that Wright leave, else he would refuse to release ''The Wall''. Several days later, worried about their financial situation, and the failing interpersonal relationships within the band, Wright quit. News of his departure was kept from the music press.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=267<U+2013>268}}</ref>  Although his name did not appear anywhere on the original album,<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=219}}</ref><ref name="Blakep269">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=269}}</ref> he was employed as a session musician on the band's subsequent ''The Wall'' tour.<ref name="Blake285286">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=285<U+2013>286}}</ref>

By August 1979 the running order was largely complete. Wright completed his duties at Cherokee Studios aided by session musicians [[Peter Wood (musician)|Peter Wood]] and [[Fred Mandel]], and [[Jeff Porcaro]] played drums in Mason's stead on "[[Mother (Pink Floyd song)|Mother]]".<ref name="Blakep269"/>  His duties complete, Mason left the final mix to Waters, Gilmour, Ezrin and Guthrie, and travelled to New York to record his d<U+00E9>but solo album, ''[[Nick Mason's Fictitious Sports]]''.<ref name="Masonp249">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=249}}</ref>  In advance of its release, technical constraints led to some changes being made to the running order and content of ''The Wall'', with "[[What Shall We Do Now?]]" being replaced by the similar but shorter "[[Empty Spaces]]", and "[[Hey You (Pink Floyd song)|Hey You]]" being moved from its original place at the end of side three, to the beginning. With the November 1979 deadline approaching, the band left the now-incorrect inner sleeves of the album unchanged.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bench|O'Brien|2004|pp=70<U+2013>72}}</ref>

Mason's early drum sessions were performed in an open space on the top floor of [[Britannia Row Studios]]. The 16-track recordings from these sessions were mixed down and copied onto a 24-track master, as guide tracks for the rest of the band to play to. This gave the engineers greater flexibility,{{#tag:ref|As well as being more flexible, repeated replay of magnetic tape can, over time, reduce the quality of the recorded material.|group="nb"}} but also improved the audio quality of the final mix as the original 16-track drum recordings were finally synced to the 24-track master, and the duplicated guide tracks removed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=239<U+2013>242}}</ref>  Ezrin later related the band's alarm at this method of working<U+2014>they apparently viewed the erasure of material from the 24-track master as "witchcraft".<ref name="Blakep263"/>

While at Super Bear studios Waters had agreed to Ezrin's suggestion that several tracks, including "Nobody Home", "The Trial" and "Comfortably Numb", should have an orchestral accompaniment. [[Michael Kamen]], who had previously worked with [[David Bowie]], was booked to oversee these arrangements, which were performed by musicians from the [[New York Philharmonic]] and [[New York Symphony]] Orchestras, and a choir from the [[New York City Opera]].<ref name="Blakepp271272">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=271<U+2013>272}}</ref>  Their sessions were recorded at CBS Studios in New York, although Pink Floyd were not present. Kamen eventually met the band once recording was complete.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=247}}</ref>

{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center|quote=I think things like "Comfortably Numb" were the last embers of mine and Roger's ability to work collaboratively together.|source=David Gilmour<ref name="Blakep275"/>|align=left|width=33%}}
"[[Comfortably Numb]]" has its origins in Gilmour's debut solo album, and was the source of much argument between Waters and Gilmour.<ref name="Schaffnerp213"/>  Ezrin claimed that the song initially started life as "<U+2026>Roger's record, about Roger, for Roger", although he thought that it needed further work. Waters re-wrote the song and added more lyrics for the chorus, but his "stripped-down and harder" recording was not to Gilmour's liking. The guitarist preferred Ezrin's "<U+2026>grander Technicolor, orchestral version", although Ezrin preferred Waters's version. Following a full-scale argument in a [[North Hollywood, California|North Hollywood]] restaurant, the two compromised; the song's body eventually included the orchestral arrangement, with Gilmour's second and final guitar solo standing alone.<ref name="Blakep275">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=275}}</ref>

===Sound effects and voices===
Ezrin and Waters oversaw the capture of the various sound effects used on the album. Waters recorded the phone call used on the original demo for "[[Young Lust (song)|Young Lust]]", but neglected to inform its recipient; Mason assumed it was a prank call and replaced the receiver in anger.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=237}}</ref>  The call is a direct reference to an incident on the band's In The Flesh Tour, when Waters's call to his wife Judy was answered by a man's voice. Waters also recorded ambient sounds along [[Hollywood Boulevard]], by hanging a microphone from a studio window. Engineer Phil Taylor recorded some of the screeching tyre noises on "Run Like Hell" from a studio car park, and a television set being destroyed was used on "[[One of My Turns]]". Back in the UK at Britannia Row Studios, Nick Griffiths recorded the smashing of crockery for the same song.<ref name="Blakepp269271">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=269<U+2013>271}}</ref>  Various television broadcasts were used on the album and one actor, recognising his own voice, accepted a financial settlement from the group in lieu of legal action against them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=250}}</ref>

The maniacal schoolmaster present throughout the album was voiced by Waters, and actress Trudy Young supplied the [[groupie]]'s voice.<ref name="Blakepp269271"/>  Backing vocals were performed by a range of artists, although a planned appearance by the [[Beach Boys]] on "The Show Must Go On" and "Waiting for the Worms" was cancelled by Waters, who instead settled for [[Bruce Johnston]] and [[Toni Tennille]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=214}}</ref>  Ezrin's suggestion of releasing "[[Another Brick in the Wall, Part II|Another Brick in the Wall part II]]" as a single with a disco-style beat did not initially find favour with Gilmour, although Mason and Waters were more enthusiastic. The bassist was originally opposed to the idea of releasing a single at all, but became more receptive once he listened to Ezrin and Guthrie's mix of the song. With two identical verses the song was felt to be lacking, and so a copy was sent to Griffiths in London, along with a request for him to find groups of children to perform several versions of the lyrics.<ref name="Blakepp271272"/>  Griffiths contacted Alun Renshaw, head of music at the nearby Islington Green school, who was more than enthusiastic about the idea:

{{Quote | I wanted to make music relevant to the kids<U+2014>not just sitting around listening to Tchaikovsky. I thought the lyrics were great<U+2014>"We don't need no education, we don't need no thought control&nbsp;<U+2026>"  I just thought it would be a wonderful experience for the kids.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=273}}</ref>}}

Griffiths at first recorded small groups of pupils and then invited more in, telling them to affect a [[Cockney]] accent, and to shout rather than sing. He multitracked the voices, making the groups sound much larger than they were, before sending his recordings back to Los Angeles. The result was that Waters was "beaming", and the song was released, becoming a Christmas number one hit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=273<U+2013>274}}</ref> There was some controversy when the British press reported that the children hadn't been paid for their efforts; they were eventually given copies of the album, and the school received a <U+00A3>1,000 donation (<U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|1000|1980|r=-3}}}} in contemporary value{{Inflation-fn|UK}}).<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=215<U+2013>216}}</ref>

==Packaging==
The cover design is one of Pink Floyd's most minimal<U+2014>a white brick wall and no text (the logo and band name is presented on a sticker). Waters had fallen out with [[Hipgnosis]] designer [[Storm Thorgerson]] several years earlier, when the latter had included the cover of ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'' in his book ''Walk Away Rene'', and ''The Wall'' is therefore the first Pink Floyd album cover since ''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn'' not created by the design group.<ref name="Blakep279">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=279}}</ref>  The LP's sleeve art and custom picture labels by cartoonist [[Gerald Scarfe]] tied in with the album's concept, with each of the four sides showing the eponymous wall in various stages of construction, accompanied by characters from the story.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simmons|1999|pp=76<U+2013>95}}</ref>

When the completed album was played for an assembled group of executives at Columbia's headquarters in California, several were reportedly unimpressed by what they heard.<ref name="Blakepp275276"/>  Matters had not been helped when [[Columbia Records]] offered Waters smaller publishing rights on the grounds that ''The Wall'' was a double album, a position he did not accept. When one executive offered to settle the dispute with a coin toss, Waters asked why he should gamble on something he owned. He eventually prevailed.<ref name="Masonp249"/> The record company's concerns were alleviated when "Another Brick in the Wall Part 2" reached number one in the UK, US, Norway, Portugal, Israel, West Germany and South Africa.<ref name="Blakepp275276">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=275<U+2013>276}}</ref> It was [[Music recording sales certification|certified]] platinum in the UK in December 1979, and platinum in the US three months later.<ref name="Poveyp348">{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=348}}</ref>

===Covers===
''The Wall'' has been covered by several acts, including Canadian alternative country band [[Luther Wright and the Wrongs]], who recorded a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] cover of the entire album titled ''[[Rebuild the Wall]]''.<ref>{{Citation | title = Luther Wright | url = http://www.lutherwright.com/thewall.php | publisher = lutherwright.com | accessdate =6 October 2009}}</ref>  Celebrating ''The Wall'''s 20th anniversary, as part of his "Out of Phase" project producer and artist Peter Mossman released ''The Wall 2000'', an [[ambient techno|ambient]] [[electronica|electronic]] version of the album.<ref>{{Citation | title = Pink Floyd Tribute: The Wall 2000 | url = http://www.amazon.com/Pink-Floyd-Tribute-Wall-2000/dp/B00004KD3A | publisher = amazon.com | accessdate =6 October 2009}}</ref>

===Tour===
During each performance of the band's subsequent ''[[The Wall Tour]]'', a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} high wall of cardboard bricks was gradually built between the band and audience. Gaps allowed the spectators to view various scenes in the story, as Scarfe's animations were projected onto the completed parts of the wall. Several characters from the story were realised as giant inflatables, including a pig, replete with a crossed hammers logo. The tour opened at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] on 7&nbsp;February 1980.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=280<U+2013>282}}</ref>  One of its more notable elements was the band's performance of "Comfortably Numb". While Waters sang his opening verse in front of the wall, Gilmour waited in darkness at the top of the wall, for his cue. When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly illuminate him, astonishing the audience. Gilmour stood on a [[flight case]] on castors, held steady by a technician, both precariously balanced atop a tall hydraulic platform.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=284<U+2013>285}}</ref>  At the end of the concert, the wall was made to collapse, once again revealing the band.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=252}}</ref> Along with the songs in the album, the tour featured an instrumental medley, "[[The Last Few Bricks]]", which was played before "Goodbye Cruel World" to allow the construction crew to complete the scenographic wall.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=233}}The band also played "[[What Shall We Do Now?]]", which was kept off the original album due to time constraints.</ref>

Scarfe was employed to produce a series of animations for ''The Wall''. At his studio in London he employed a team of 40&nbsp;animators to create a series of nightmarish visions of the future, including a dove of peace exploding to reveal an eagle, a schoolmaster, and Pink's mother.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=223<U+2013>225}}</ref>  During the tour relationships within the band were at an all-time low; four [[Winnebago Industries|Winnebago]]s were parked in a circle, with the doors facing away from the centre. Waters remained isolated, using his own vehicle to arrive at the venue, and stayed in separate hotels from the rest of the band. Wright, returning to perform his duties as a salaried musician, was the only member of the band to profit from the venture, which lost about <U+00A3>400,000.<ref name="Blake285286"/>

Scarfe's animations were also to have been used in [[Pink Floyd<U+2014>The Wall|the film]] based on the album, accompanied by live concert footage, but the latter proved too impractical to film. [[Alan Parker]] agreed to direct the film, which kept the animated sequences but also used professional actors in each scene, with no dialogue. [[Bob Geldof]] took the role of Pink. A modified soundtrack was also created for some of the film's songs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=288<U+2013>292}}</ref>  ''Pink Floyd The Wall'' was released in July 1982.<ref name="Blakep263"/>

In 1990 Waters and producer [[Tony Hollingsworth]] created ''[[The Wall <U+2013> Live in Berlin]]'', staged for charity at a site once occupied by part of the [[Berlin Wall]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp= 342<U+2013>347}}</ref> Between 2010 and 2012, Waters performed the album worldwide on his tour, ''[[The Wall Live (concert tour)|The Wall Live]]''<ref name=cbsnews>{{cite news |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/12/entertainment/main6388449.shtml?tag=mncol;lst;1 | work=CBS News | title=Roger Waters to Restage "The Wall" on 2010 Tour | date=12 April 2010|accessdate=5 November 2010}}</ref>.
