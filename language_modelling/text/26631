'''Oregon Route 58''' is an [[Oregon]] [[state highway]] that runs between the city of [[Goshen, Oregon|Goshen]], just south of [[Eugene]], and [[U.S. Route 97]] between [[Chemult, Oregon|Chemult]] and [[La Pine, Oregon|La Pine]].  It is known as the '''Willamette Highway''', which is [[State highways in Oregon|Highway 18]], and it is a key transportation link between the [[Willamette Valley]] and [[Central Oregon]].  The highway, signed east-to-west, runs northwest to southeast.

==Route description==

Oregon Route 58 begins (at its western terminus) at an interchange with [[Interstate 5]] and [[Oregon Route 99]] near Goshen, located between the cities of Eugene and [[Creswell, Oregon|Creswell]].  It heads due southeast from there, following the course of the [[Willamette River]] into the foothills of the [[Cascade Mountains]].  The highway passes several lakes, including [[Dexter Lake]] and [[Lookout Point Lake]], and provides access to the town of [[Lowell, Oregon|Lowell]].  Further into the mountains, it passes through the cities of [[Oakridge, Oregon|Oakridge]] and [[Westfir, Oregon|Westfir]].  It continues into the mountains, to the summit of [[Willamette Pass]], after which it descends into central Oregon.  Oregon Route 58 terminates at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 97]].

Oregon Route 58 is of high importance as a freight corridor.  It is the primary route between the [[Willamette Valley]] and south-central Oregon, including the [[Klamath Falls, Oregon|Klamath Falls]] region.  It also is the preferred route to points further southeast, including [[Reno, Nevada]].  Finally, it is an important alternate route for traffic moving up and down the West Coast, as bad weather frequently closes [[Interstate 5]] at the [[Siskiyou Mountains|Siskiyou Pass]] during the winter.  It should be noted that the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] main line between Oregon and [[California]] roughly follows OR 58 and US 97.  While a rail line exists through Siskiyou Pass, it is difficult for trains to use even in good weather, due to an excessively steep grade, and is often uneconomical to use in winter weather.  It is common for West Coast truck traffic to prefer OR 58 and US 97 to Interstate 5 for the same reason.

Two scenic byways--the [[West Cascades Scenic Byway]] and the [[Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway]]--intersect with OR 58.
