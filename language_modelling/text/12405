==Education==
Modi'in Illit has 30 elementary schools and 20 secondary schools (seminaries and [[yeshivas]]). The city is home to many commercial enterprises. Because of its sizable English-speaking immigrant population, it has become a center for high-quality [[outsourcing]] by American companies. There are approximately 80 [[synagogue]]s. A significant number of men study the Torah full time.

==Local politics==
Rabbi [[Meir Kessler]] is the [[chief rabbi]] and Rabbi [[Yaakov Gutterman]] is the town's mayor. The first [[Local council (Israel)|head of council]] of Modi'in Illit was Yosef Schwinger, appointed by the [[Ministry of the Interior (Israel)|Ministry of the Interior]]. Yaakov Gutterman replaced him in 2002, and has been reinstated twice because no candidates ran against him.

===Legal status of the settlement===
Modi'in Illit is an Israeli settlement in the West Bank. Israeli settlements in the [[Israeli-occupied territories]] are widely regarded as illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.<ref name=Asser /> Israel argues that the international conventions relating to occupied land do not apply to the Palestinian territories because they were not under the legitimate sovereignty of any state in the first place.<ref name="bbc">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1682640.stm The Geneva Convention], BBC News, 24 August, 2004.</ref>

Modi'in Illit received city status in 2008, by [[Aluf]] [[Gadi Shamni]]. The Israeli [[NGO]] [[B'Tselem]] appealed the decision to the [[Ministry of Interior (Israel)|Ministry of Interior]]. Btselem claimed that the upgrading of Modi'in Illit's status to that of a municipality was of concern because the land on which Mod'in Illit was built was declared state land through a manipulative application of [[Mecelle|Ottoman Law]], resulting in the confiscation of lands belonging to neighbouring [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] villages. B'Tselem also stated that the upgraded status would lead to an increase of the settler population of Modi'in Illit, and thus the change in status would be illegal. For these reasons, B'Tselem expressed "vehement opposition" to the change of status.<ref name="btselem">[http://www.btselem.org/Download/20051104_Modiin_Ilit_Letter_Eng.pdf B'Tselem's position on turning Modi'in Illit into a municipality], B'Tselem - The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, November 4, 2005.</ref> In connection with separate allegations that the city has allowed illegal construction to take place, the [[Israel Defence Forces]] told Israel's Interior Ministry in May 2008 that Modi'in Illit was "in a state of lawlessness."<ref name=Eldar>Eldar, Akiva.

===Attacks on residents ===
On Monday morning, December 29, 2008 around 8 am, an Arab worker fixing a heating system on a 6th story apartment on Rebbi Yehuda HaNasi Street in Ahuzat Brachfeld struck his supervisor with a sledgehammer to his head.<ref>http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/129080</ref> The attacker then proceeded to the street and attacked several passersby, stabbing several of them. After he managed to stab four Jews and beat up several others, he was shot and seriously wounded by an emergency response team member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART1/832/232.html?hp=0&loc=3&tmp=6958|title=Modi'in Illit: Four Stabbed in Attack|publisher=[[Maariv]]|author=Sharon, Ronny; Matzik, Ilan|date=December 29, 2008|accessdate=2009-08-18}} {{he icon}}</ref>-->
