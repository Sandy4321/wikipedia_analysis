The '''manta ray''' ('''''Manta birostris''''') is the largest species of the [[batoidea|rays]]. The largest known specimen was more than {{convert|7.6|m|ft}} across, with a weight of about {{convert|1300|kg|lb}}. It ranges throughout [[tropical]] waters of the world, typically around coral reefs. They have the largest brain-to-body ratio of the sharks, rays and skates ([[Elasmobranchii]]).<ref>

Mantas have a variety of common names, including '''Atlantic manta''', '''Pacific manta''', '''devilfish''', and just '''manta'''. At one time it was thought that there were many species of manta. However, the modern scientific consensus has been that there is just one species,<ref>{{cite book|author=Last, P.R.|coauthor=Stevens, J.D.|title=Sharks and rays of Australia|location=Melbourne, Australia|publisher=CSIRO|year=1994|isbn=0643051430}}</ref> a view supported by mitochondrial DNA studies.<ref>{{cite book |type=MS thesis |first=Timothy Brian |last=Clark |title=Population Structure of Manta birostris (Chondrichthyes: mobulidae) from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans |publisher=Texas A & M University |year=2002 |oclc=52083914}}</ref>
 
Recent studies have suggested that manta rays actually comprise at least two different species, the giant manta ('''''Manta birostris'''''), which migrates, and another smaller one called the reef manta ('''''[[Manta alfredi]]'''''), which does not.<ref name="SOS">{{cite web

The genus is generally considered to be in need of worldwide revision. Even the accepted name ''Manta birostris'' is often incorrectly ascribed to Walbaum (1792).

==Taxonomy==
Manta rays are bottom-feeders, and adapt in the open ocean [[filter feeder]]s. This feeding strategy allowed them to grow larger than other ray species. Some ancestral characteristics degenerated due to the feeding change. For example, all that remains of the oral teeth is a small band of [[vestigial]] teeth on the lower jaw, almost hidden by the skin. The number and size of their dermal [[denticle]]s are also reduced. Manta rays have a much thicker [[mucus]] body coating than other rays. Their [[spiracle]]s have become small and non-functional, as all water is consumed orally. Mantas have a tail similar to [[stingray]]s, but they have lost their stinger and are harmless to divers.<ref>[http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/topics/lh_manta_faq.htm Manta Ray (Manta birostris) FAQ]</ref>

==Behaviour==
[[Image:Manta-ray australia.jpg|thumb|left|Underside of manta ray with [[remora]]s at [[Ningaloo Reef]]|alt=Night-time photo of manta and remoras]]
Mantas feed on [[plankton]], [[fish]] [[larvae]] and the like, filtered from the water passing through their gills as they swim. They catch small prey organisms on flat horizontal plates of russet-colored spongy tissue spanning spaces between the manta's gill bars.

Manta rays frequently visit [[cleaning station]]s where small fish such as [[wrasse]], [[remora]], and [[Pomacanthidae|angelfish]] swim in the manta's gills and over its skin to feed, in the process cleaning it of parasites and dead tissue.

Large sharks and in some circumstances [[orca]]s, are manta's main predators.<ref>

Mantas [[Breach (whale)|breach]] the surface and launch into the air.

The breeding behaviour observed for manta rays is similar to other closely related rays. Copulation occurs near the surface, no deeper than a metre below. It begins with the male chasing the female, for up to half an hour. The male bites the pectoral fin and then moves its claspers into the cloaca, holding it there for a minute to a minute and a half.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Kazunari |last1=Yano |first2=Fumihiko |last2=Sato |first3=Tomoko |last3=Takahashi |month=September |year=1999 |title=Observations of mating behavior of the manta ray, ''Manta birostris'', at the Ogasawara Islands, Japan |journal=Ichthyological Research |volume=46 |issue=3 |doi=10.1007/BF02678515 |pages=289<U+2013>96}}</ref>

==In captivity==
Manta rays are very rarely kept in captivity, primarily due to their size. Only four aquariums in the world display manta rays.<ref>

Rehabilitated, and outgrowing her aquarium, [[uShaka Marine World]], Nandi moved to the larger [[Georgia Aquarium]] in August 2008, where she resides in its 6.2-million-gallon "Ocean Voyager" exhibit. A second manta ray joined that aquarium's collection in September 2009, dubbed "Tallulah." A third manta ray has recently been added to the Ocean Voyager exhibit.<ref>{{cite news

The [[Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium]] also houses manta rays in the "Kuroshio Sea" tank, the second-largest aquarium tank in the world. On June 16, 2007, the first manta ray born in captivity was born at the aquarium. Although the pup born in 2007 did not survive, the aquarium has also since seen the birth of two more manta rays in 2008 and 2009.<ref>

The [[Lisbon Oceanarium]] also hosted a manta ray before releasing it in 2007. A manta ray was hosted again in 2008.

==In culture==

The ancient [[Peru]]vian [[Moche]] people  worshipped the sea and its animals. Their art often depicts manta rays.<ref>

In 2009, [[SeaWorld Orlando]] debuted ''[[Manta (SeaWorld Orlando)|Manta]]'', a [[flying roller coaster]] themed to resemble the manta ray, along with an exhibit featuring other ray species. A [[Manta (SeaWorld San Diego)|similar attraction]] will debut at [[SeaWorld San Diego]] in 2012.

The original [[Opel Manta]] A sports coupe build in the 70s in Germany derives its name from its distinctive front section that is designed to imitate the shape of the Manta rays "face".

The American alternative rock band [[Pixies]] has also recorded songs called "Manta Ray" and "Dancing the Manta Ray." In 2010, the alternative band [[Ludo]] released a song titled "Manta Rays."<ref>
