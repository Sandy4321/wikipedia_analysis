The '''rat trick''' was a gimmick popularized by fans of the [[Florida Panthers]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) during their [[1995<U+2013>96 Florida Panthers season|1995<U+2013>96 season]] and trip to the [[1996 Stanley Cup Finals]].  The term, a play on [[hat trick]], was coined by Panthers goaltender [[John Vanbiesbrouck]] after teammate [[Scott Mellanby]] killed a rat in the locker room prior to the team's home opener, then scored two goals.  By the time the Panthers reached the 1996 playoffs, fans were throwing thousands of rats onto the ice after every Panthers goal, resulting in an off-season rule change by the NHL that allowed for referees to penalize the home team if fans disrupt the game by throwing objects onto the ice.

==Origin==
The [[1995<U+2013>96 NHL season|1995<U+2013>96 season]] was the third in the NHL for the Panthers, who had been awarded as an expansion franchise in 1992.  The team was comprised of journeymen veterans, rookies, and led [[NHL All-Star Game|all-star]] goaltender [[John Vanbiesbrouck]].<ref name="Rat Pack">{{cite web |last=Montville |first=Leigh |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1008229/index.htm |title=Rat Pack |work=Sports Illustrated |date=1996-06-10 |accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref>  As the team prepared for it's home opener against the [[Calgary Flames]] on October 8, 1995, a rat entered the dressing room, startling several players.  [[Scott Mellanby]] reacted by shooting the rat across the locker room with his stick, killing it. He then went out and scored two goals in a 4<U+2013>3 victory over the Flames, leading the Panthers to their first win of the season.<ref name="Rink Rats">{{cite web |last=Montville |first=Leigh |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1007428/index.htm |title=Rink Rats |work=Sports Illustrated |date=1995-11-20 |accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref>  Vanbiesbrouck described the incident to reporters after the game, stating that while Mellanby failed to score a [[hat trick]] (three goals in one game), he did manage a "rat trick".<ref name="Rink Rats" />

During the next game, a fan threw a plastic rat onto the ice following a Panthers goal.  The following game, a few more rats hit the ice.<ref name="Rat Pack" />  Eventually, over 100 rats were tossed to the ice following Panthers goals,<ref name="NYT-0526">{{cite web |last=Nobles |first=Charlie |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E6D91139F935A15756C0A960958260 |title=Panthers Enjoying The Year Of the Rat |work=New York Times |date=1996-05-26 |accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref> as the Panthers emerged as the top team in the league by mid November.<ref name="Rink Rats" />  Florida finished the regular season in third place in the [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/seasons/nhl19271996.html |title=1995<U+2013>96 NHL standings |publisher=hockeydb.com |accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref> and qualified for the playoffs for the first time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/display_standings.php?tmi=5763 |title=Florida Panthers records |publisher=hockeydb.com |accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref>

==1996 Stanley Cup playoffs==
The Panthers defeated the [[Boston Bruins]] in five games, then the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in six to reach the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] finals.  They then defeated the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in seven games to win the [[Prince of Wales Trophy]] as the rat tossing craze reached it's peak as 3,000 rats rained onto the ice following goals.<ref name="NYT-0526" />  While officially frowning on the practice of throwing rats, the team nonetheless brought on [[Orkin]] as a sponsor and employed a crew of 40 rink attendants dressed up as exterminators to clear the ice after each Florida goal.<ref name="Rat Pack" />

The "year of the rat" in south Florida reached a fever pitch as the Panthers made their first trip to the [[Stanley Cup]] finals.  Area supermarkets sold "rat cakes"<U+2014>cupcakes with rats drawn in frosting<U+2014>while baseball's [[Florida Marlins]] showed the Panther's game seven victory against the Penguins, in Pittsburgh, on the jumbotron and had the Panthers' arena announcer on hand to announce when the team scored a goal.<ref name="Rat Pack" />  The Panthers, who had sold out only 15 of 42 home games during the regular season, sold out their first two games against Philadelphia and Pittsburgh in seven minutes.<ref name="NYT-0526" />

In the first game of the finals, a 3<U+2013>1 Colorado victory, fans of the [[Colorado Avalanche]] responded by throwing rat traps onto the ice in Denver following Avalanche goals.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lapointe |first=Joe |title=Colorado's Answers: Rat Traps and Roy  |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E1D81F39F936A35755C0A960958260 |date=1996-06-5 |accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref>  The Avalanche won the second game to lead the series 2<U+2013>0 as the teams returned to Miami for games three and four.  During the first period of game three, Colorado goaltender [[Patrick Roy]] famously refused to duck under his net, as other goalies had, to hide from the barrage of rats after he surrendered a goal in the first period.  During the intermission, Roy announced to his team that there would be "no more rats".  True to his word, Roy did not surrender another goal, as the Avalanche won game three, then shut out the Panthers 1<U+2013>0 in game four to sweep the series, and win Colorado's first Stanley Cup.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pang |first=Darren |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=pang_darren&id=1648803 |title=Roy: More than a great goalie |publisher=ESPN |date=2003-10-29 |accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref>

==Rule change==
Directly as a result of Florida's rat trick craze, the league amended its rules prior to the [[1996<U+2013>97 NHL season|1996<U+2013>97 season]] to prevent a reoccurrence of this phenomenon and the delays to the game that accompanied it.  The league declared that if fans threw debris onto the ice, the referee can have the public address announcer warn the fans to stop.  After a warning, the referee can then issue a delay of game penalty to the home team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E5D81431F937A2575BC0A960958260 |title=Results plus |work=New York Times |date=1996-08-14 |accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref>  The league, however, created a special exemption for articles "thrown onto the ice following a special occasion", specifically excluding the traditional tossing of hats onto the ice following a hat trick goal from being subject to the penalty.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26355 |title=Rule 63 <U+2013> Delaying the Game |publisher=National Hockey League |accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref>
