'''Trengwainton''' is a garden situated in [[Madron]], near [[Penzance]], [[Cornwall]], England, UK, which has been in the ownership of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] since 1961. The garden is noted for its collection of exotic trees and shrubs and offers views over [[Mount's Bay]] and [[The Lizard]].

A dwelling has been on the site since at least the 16th century. The [[walled garden]], which was built in Elizabethan times, seems to have been constructed as a response to the period of persistently cooler weather known as the [[Maunder Minimum]]. The wall prevented warm air from escaping from the garden on cool nights, thereby allowing frost-sensitive fruit trees to survive, despite the cooling climate.<ref>Tim Ball, "Environment Canada and the UN(IPCC) ignore major climate change mechanism," in ''The Landowner'', August<U+2013>September, 2012, p. 41.</ref>

In 1814 the estate was bought by [[Price Baronets|Rose Price]] the son of a Jamaican sugar plantation owner. Trengwainton was sold following the loss of income resulting in the 1833 [[Emancipation Act]] which freed slaves on the family<U+2019>s Worthy Estate in [[Jamaica]]. In 1867 the property was bought by T S Bolitho whose family still live in Trengwainton House. Rose Price planted trees and built the walled gardens, which are said to be based on the dimensions of [[Noah<U+2019>s Ark]] and in 1925 Sir Edward Bolitho and his head gardener Alfred Creek continued the development of the garden. They were opened to the public, for the first time, in 1931. The [[Victoria Medal of Honour]] for Horticulture was awarded to Sir Edward in 1961 and in the same year he donated 98 acres to the National Trust.<ref>National Trust celebrates its 50 years at <U+2018>gem<U+2019> of a garden.
