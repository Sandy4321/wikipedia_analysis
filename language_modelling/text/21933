== History ==
The plan for the GNU operating system was publicly announced on September 27, 1983, on the net.unix-wizards and net.usoft [[newsgroup]]s by [[Richard Stallman]].<ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=new UNIX implementation |first=Richard |last=Stallman |date=September 27, 1983 |newsgroup=net.unix-wizards |id=771@mit-eddie.UUCP |url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.unix-wizards/msg/4dadd63a976019d7 |accessdate=August 18, 2008 }}</ref><ref name="internethist">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qi-ItIG6QLwC |title=The Internet: A Historical Encyclopedia.

The goal was to bring a wholly free software operating system into existence. Stallman wanted computer users to be "free", as most were in the 1960s and 1970s&nbsp;<U+2013> free to study the source code of the software they use, free to share the software with other people, free to modify the behavior of the software, and free to publish their modified versions of the software. This philosophy was later published as the [[GNU Manifesto]] in March 1985.<ref name="internethist" />

Richard Stallman's experience with the [[Incompatible Timesharing System]] (ITS),<ref name="intervention" /> an early operating system written in [[assembly language]] that became obsolete due to discontinuation of [[PDP-10]], the computer architecture for which ITS was written, led to a decision that a [[porting|portable]] system was necessary.<ref name="rms-zagreb-talk" />{{rp|at=[http://fsfeurope.org/documents/rms-fs-2006-03-09.en.html#choosing-the-unix-design 00:40:52]}}<ref name="opensource2.0">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=q9GnNrq3e5EC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Open Sources 2.0: The Continuing Evolution |first1=Chris |last1=DiBona |first2=Mark |last2=Stone |first3=Danese |last3=Cooper |month=october |year=2005 |pages=38<U+2013>40 |isbn=9780596008024}}</ref> It was thus decided that GNU would be mostly compatible with Unix.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=53zaxy423xcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Beginning Portable Shell Scripting: From Novice to Professional (Expert's Voice in Open Source)|month=November|year=2008|pages=177<U+2013>178 |isbn=9781430210436 |author1=Seebach |first1=Peter}}</ref> At the time, Unix was already a popular [[proprietary software|proprietary]] operating system. The design of Unix was modular, so it could be reimplemented piece by piece.<ref name="opensource2.0" />

Much of the needed software had to be written from scratch, but existing compatible third-party free software components were also used such as the [[TeX]] typesetting system, the [[X Window System]],<ref name="internethist" /> and the [[Mach (kernel)|Mach]] microkernel that forms the basis of the [[GNU Mach]] core of [[GNU Hurd]] (the official kernel of GNU).<ref name="linuxinterface">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ps2SH727eCIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Linux Programming Interface: A Linux and UNIX System Programming Handbook|pages=5<U+2013>6|month=october|year=2010 |isbn=9781593272203 |author1=Kerrisk |first1=Michael}}</ref> With the exception of the aforementioned third-party components, most of GNU has been written by volunteers of the GNU Project; some in their spare time, some paid by companies,<ref name="cygnus">{{cite book |url=http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/tiemans.html |title=Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |publisher=O'Reilly & Associates, Inc. |month=January |year=1999 |isbn=1-56592-582-3}}</ref> educational institutions, and other non-profit organizations. In October 1985, Stallman set up the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF). In the late 1980s and 1990s, the FSF hired software developers to write the software needed for GNU.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LlCnYt2snHYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Software Industry | pages=187<U+2013>196 |isbn=9783642315091 |author1=Buxmann |first1=Peter |last2=Diefenbach |first2=Heiner |last3=Hess |first3=Thomas |date=2012-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=50maN7VmpusC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Practical UNIX and Internet Security, 3rd Edition | publisher=O'Reilly & Associates, Inc. |month=February |year=2003 | pages=18 |isbn=9781449310127}}</ref>

As GNU gained prominence, interested businesses began contributing to development or selling GNU software and technical support. The most prominent and successful of these was [[Cygnus Solutions]],<ref name="cygnus" /> now part of [[Red Hat]].<ref>[http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-232971.html Red Hat buys software firm, shuffles CEO - CNET News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The official kernel of GNU Project is the [[GNU Hurd]] microkernel; however, as of 2012, the [[Linux kernel]] is officially part of the GNU Project in the form of [[Linux-libre]], a variant of Linux with all proprietary components removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/GNU_Linux-libre |title=GNU Linux-libre |date=2012-12-17 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref>

== Copyright, GNU licenses, and stewardship ==
The GNU Project recommends that contributors assign the copyright for GNU packages to the Free Software Foundation,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Copyright-Papers.html |title=Copyright Papers | work = Information For Maintainers of GNU Software |publisher=Gnu.org |date=2011-06-30 |accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.html |title=Why the FSF gets copyright assignments from contributors |publisher=Gnu.org |date=2011-07-15 |accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref> though the Free Software Foundation considers it acceptable to release small changes to an existing project to the [[public domain]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-recommendations.html |publisher=Free Software Foundation |title=How to choose a license for your own work |deadurl=no |accessdate=2012-07-12}}</ref> However, this is not required; package maintainers may retain copyright to the GNU packages they maintain, though since only the copyright holder may enforce the license used (such as the GNU GPL), the copyright holder in this case enforces it rather than the Free Software Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/esr/Licensing-HOWTO.html |title=Licensing HOWTO |publisher=Catb.org |date=2002-11-09 |accessdate=2012-09-22}}</ref>

For the software developed under the GNU Project, Stallman wrote a license called the [[GNU General Public License]] (first called Emacs General Public License), with the goal to guarantee users freedom to share and change free
software.<ref>https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-1.0.txt</ref> Stallman wrote this license after his experience with [[James Gosling]] and a program called UniPress, over a controversy around software code use in the GNU Emacs program.<ref name="twobits">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MEmMl-tY8jEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Two Bits: The Cultural Significance of Free Software|chapter=Writing Copyright Licenses|month=june|year=2008|isbn=9780822342649|author1=Kelty|first1=Christopher M}}</ref><ref>[http://www.free-soft.org/gpl_history/ The History of the GNU General Public License<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> For most of the 80s, each GNU package had its own license: the Emacs General Public License, the GCC General Public License, etc. In 1989, FSF published a single license they could use for all their software, and which could be used by non-GNU projects: the GNU General Public License (GPL).<ref name="twobits" /><ref>[https://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull5.html GNU's Bulletin, vol. 1 no. 5 - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

This license is now used by most GNU programs, as well as a large number of free software programs that are not part of the GNU Project; it is also the most commonly used [[free software license]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://osrc.blackducksoftware.com/data/licenses/index.php |title=Open Source License Data |work=Open Source Resource Center |publisher=[[Black Duck Software]] |accessdate=September 24, 2012 }}</ref> It gives all recipients of a program the right to run, copy, modify and distribute it, while forbidding them from imposing further restrictions on any copies they distribute. This idea is often referred to as [[copyleft]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=c7ppFih2mSwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Decoding Liberation: The Promise of Free and Open Source Software|pages=46<U+2013>52|month=august|year=2007|isbn=9780415978934|author1=Chopra|first1=Samir|last2=Dexter|first2=Scott}}</ref>

In 1991, the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL), then known as the Library General Public License, was written for the [[GNU C Library]] to allow it to be linked with proprietary software.<ref>[http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/bsdl-gpl/origins-lgpl.html The origins of Linux and the LGPL<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 1991 also saw the release of version 2 of the GNU GPL. The [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (FDL), for documentation, followed in 2000.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2VElII9QeakC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Innovation Happens Elsewhere: Open Source as Business Strategy|pages=133<U+2013>134|month=april|year=2005|isbn=9781558608894|author1=Goldman|first1=Ron|last2=Gabriel|first2=Richard P}}</ref> The GPL and LGPL were revised to version 3 in 2007, adding clauses to protect users against [[hardware restrictions]] that prevent user to run modified software on their own devices.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gmfFsdIAejkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Linux Essentials |chapter=Free Software and the GPL |year=2012 |isbn=9781118197394 |author1=Smith |first1=Roderick W}}</ref>

In addition to GNU's own packages, the GNU Project's licenses are also used by many unrelated projects, such as the [[Linux kernel]], which is often used with GNU software. A minority of the software used by GNU, such as the X Window System, is licensed under [[permissive free software license]]s.

== Logo ==
The logo for GNU is a [[wildebeest|gnu]] head. Originally drawn by Etienne Suvasa, a bolder and simpler version designed by Aurelio Heckert is now preferred.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/graphics/agnuhead.html |title=A GNU Head |publisher= Free Software Foundation (FSF)|date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/graphics/heckert_gnu.html |title=A Bold GNU Head |publisher= Free Software Foundation (FSF)|date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref> It appears in GNU software and in printed and electronic documentation for the GNU Project, and is also used in Free Software Foundation materials.
