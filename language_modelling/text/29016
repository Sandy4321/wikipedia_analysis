'''Ethan Allen''' ({{OldStyleDate|January 21, 1738||January 10, 1737}}<ref name="Birthdate">Allen's date of birth is made confusing by two calendrical differences.  The first is the conversion between the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s, which offsets the date by 11 days.  The second is that, at that time, the New Year began on March 25.  As a result, while his birth is officially recorded as happening on January 10, 1737, conversions due to these changes make the date in the modern calendar January 21, 1738.  Adjusting for the movement of the New Year to January changes the year to 1738; adjusting for the conversion between Julian and Gregorian calendars changes the date from January 10 to 21.  See [[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 2 and [[#Hall|Hall]], p. 5.</ref> <U+2013> February 12, 1789) was a farmer, businessman, land speculator, philosopher, writer, and [[American Revolutionary War]] patriot, hero, and politician.

He was an early [[American revolution]]ary and [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] leader who fought against the [[Province of New York]]'s attempts to take control of the [[New Hampshire Grants]].  He is probably most widely known for his participation in the May 10, 1775 [[capture of Fort Ticonderoga]],  and for later political and military activities leading first to the formation of the [[Republic of Vermont]] and then to [[Vermont]]'s statehood.

In addition to his military and political activities, he wrote accounts of his exploits in the war that were widely read in the 19th century, as well as philosophical treatises and documents relating to the politics of Vermont's formation.  His business dealings included successful farming operations, one of Connecticut's early iron works, and land speculation in the Vermont territory.  He was twice married, fathering eight children.

==Early life==
[[Image:PostcardLitchfieldCTEthanAllenBirthplace1916.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Birthplace, [[Litchfield, Connecticut|Litchfield]], [[Connecticut]]]]
===Childhood===
Ethan Allen was born in [[Litchfield, Connecticut|Litchfield]], [[Connecticut]], the first-born child of Joseph and Mary Baker Allen. The family moved to [[Cornwall, Connecticut|Cornwall]] shortly after his birth. Seven siblings, all of whom survived to adulthood, joined the family between Allen's birth and 1751. His brothers [[Ira Allen|Ira]] and [[Heman Allen (of Cornwall)|Heman]] were also prominent figures in the early history of Vermont.<ref name="Jellison3">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 3</ref>

While not very much is known about Allen's childhood, the town of Cornwall was frontier territory in the 1740s, but, by the time Allen reached his teens, the area, while still a difficult area in which to make a living, began to resemble a town, with wood-frame houses beginning to replace the rough cabins of the early settlers.  When Allen's father Joseph died in 1755, he was one of the largest landowners in the area, ran a successful farm, and had served as town [[selectman]].<ref name="Jellison4">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 4</ref>  Allen had, before his father's death, begun studies under a minister in the nearby town of [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] with the goal of gaining admission to [[Yale University|Yale College]].  Allen's brother Ira recalled that, even at  a young age, Ethan was curious and interested in learning.<ref name="Jellison5">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 5</ref>

===Marriage and early adulthood===

Unfortunately for Allen, his father's death put an end to his studies.  While he volunteered for militia service in 1757 in response to French movements resulting in the [[Battle of Fort William Henry]], his unit received word while en route that the fort had fallen, and turned back.<ref name="Jellison7">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 7</ref>  Even though the [[French and Indian War]] continued to be fought over the next several years, Allen did not apparently participate in any further military activities, and is presumed to have tended the farm, at least until 1762.  In that year, he became part owner of an iron furnace in Salisbury.<ref name="Hall12_3">[[#Hall|Hall]], pp. 12<U+2013>13</ref>  He also married Mary Brownson, a woman five years his senior, from the nearby town of [[Roxbury, Connecticut|Roxbury]] in July 1762.  They first settled in Cornwall, but moved the next year to Salisbury with their infant daughter Loraine, where he bought a small farm, and proceeded to develop the iron works.<ref name="Jellison8_9">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 8<U+2013>9</ref>  The expansion of the iron works was apparently costly to Allen; he was forced to sell off portions of the Cornwall property to raise funds, and eventually sold half of his interest in the works to his brother Heman.<ref name="Jellison9">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 9</ref>  In October 1765, the Allen brothers sold their interest in the iron works.

By most accounts, Allen's marriage was an unhappy one.  His wife was rigidly religious and prone to criticism, and was barely able to read and write, in contrast to Allen's interest in learning, and sometimes flamboyant behavior.<ref name="Jellison8">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 8</ref>  In spite of this, the marriage, which produced five children (of which only two reached adulthood), survived until Mary's death in 1783.

Exploits in those years also introduced Allen to the wrong side of the justice system, which became a recurring feature of his life.  In one incident, he and his brother Heman went to the farm of a neighbor, some of whose pigs had escaped onto their land, and seized the pigs.  The neighbor sued to have the animals returned to him; Allen argued the case in their defense, but lost the case.  Ethan and Heman were fined ten shillings, and the neighbor received another five shillings in damages.<ref name="Jellison10_1">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 10<U+2013>11</ref>  He was also called to court in Salisbury for inoculating himself against [[smallpox]], a process that at the time required the sanction of the town selectmen.<ref name="Jellison12">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 12</ref>

===Reason: the Only Oracle of Man===
When he moved to Salisbury, Allen met [[Thomas Young (American revolutionary)|Thomas Young]], a doctor living and practicing just across the provincial boundary in New York.  The learned doctor, only five years older than Allen, taught the young Allen a great deal about philosophy and political theory, while Allen was able to bring to Young his appreciation of nature and life on the frontier.  Young and Allen eventually decided to collaborate on a book that was to be an attack on organized religion, as Young had convinced Allen to become a [[Deism|Deist]].  They worked on the manuscript until 1764, when Young moved away from the area, taking the manuscript with him.<ref name="Jellison15_7">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 15<U+2013>17</ref>

It was not until many years later, after Young's death, that Allen was able to recover the manuscript.  He expanded and reworked the material, and eventually published it as ''Reason: the Only Oracle of Man''.<ref name="Jellison17">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 17</ref>

===Moving around===
While Heman remained in Salisbury, where he ran a general store until is death in 1778, Ethan's movements over the next few years are poorly documented.<ref name="Jellison30">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 30</ref>  He is known to have been living in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] in the spring of 1766, where his son Joseph was born, and where apparently investigated opportunities offered by a lead mine.  He was asked to leave Northampton in July 1767 by the authorities; no obvious reason is known.<ref name="Jellison30"/>  He then briefly returned to Salisbury before settling in nearby [[Sheffield, Massachusetts]], with his younger brother Zimri.  It is likely that his first visits to the [[New Hampshire Grants]] occurred during these years.  While Sheffield would be the family home for ten years, Allen was often absent for extended periods.<ref name="Jellison31">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 31</ref>

==The New Hampshire Grants==
{{see also|New Hampshire Grants}}
As early as 1749, [[Benning Wentworth]], New Hampshire's governor, had begun selling land grants in the area west of the [[Connecticut River]], to which New Hampshire had always laid somewhat dubious claims.  Many of these grants were sold at relatively low prices to land speculators.  In 1764, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]] issued an order resolving the competing claims of New York and New Hampshire in favor of New York.  New York, which had also issued land grants that overlapped some of those sold by Wentworth, insisted that holders of the Wentworth grants pay a fee to New York to have their grants validated.  As this fee approached the original purchase price, and many of the holders were land-rich and cash-poor, there was a great deal of resistance to this demand.  By 1769 the situation in the Grants had deteriorated to the point where surveyors and other figures of New York authority were being physically threatened and driven from the area.<ref name="Jellison20_6">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 20<U+2013>26</ref>

===Allen asked for assistance===
A number of the holders of Wentworth grants were originally from northwestern Connecticut, and some of them, including [[Remember Baker]] and [[Seth Warner]], were relatives of Allen.  In 1770, a group of Wentworth grant holders asked Allen to defend their case before New York's Supreme Court, a move that presented Allen with his first big stage.<ref name="Jellison31"/>  This move to leadership was not unusual; he was known among his contemporaries to be willing to step forward and take control.<ref name="Jellison32">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 32</ref>  The trial, which pitted politically powerful New York grant-holders, including New York's Lieutenant Governor [[Cadwallader Colden|Colden]], [[James Duane]] (who was prosecuting the case), and also [[Robert Livingston (1708<U+2013>1790)|Robert Livingston]], the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (who was presiding over the case), against Allen's small group, began in July 1770.  The trial was brief, and the outcome unsurprising, as the court refused to accept the introduction of Wentworth's grants as evidence, citing their fraudulently-issued nature.<ref name="Jellison32_6">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 32<U+2013>36</ref>  Before departing for Bennington with the news, Allen was visited by Duane, who offered Allen payments which Duane described in his diary as payment "for going among the people to quiet them".<ref name="Jellison37">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 37</ref>  Allen denied taking any money; even if he did, he was unlikely to honor Duane's request.<ref name="Jellison37"/>  According to Allen's account, he was outraged, and left his visitors with veiled threats, indicating that attempts to enforce the judgment would be met with resistance.<ref name="Jellison38">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 38</ref>

[[Image:Catamount2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Catamount Tavern]], late in the 19th century]]
While many historians have believed that Allen took these actions because he already held Wentworth grants of his own, there is no evidence that he was issued any such grants until after he had been asked to take up the defense of grants held by others.  In between May 1770, when he first began working on the defense, and the trial in July, he acquired, for the price of $50, grants from Wentworth to about 1,000 acres of land in [[Poultney, Vermont|Poultney]] and [[Castleton, Vermont|Castleton]].<ref name="Jellison33">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 33</ref>

===Green Mountain Boys===
On Allen's return to Bennington, settlers met at the [[Catamount Tavern]] to discuss their options.  These discussions resulted in the formation of the [[Green Mountain Boys]], with local militia companies in each of the surrounding towns.  Allen was named their Colonel Commandant, and cousins Seth Warner and Remember Baker were captains of two of the companies.<ref name="Jellison39_40">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 39<U+2013>40</ref>  Further meetings resulted in the creation of committees of safety, and laid down rules by which to resist attempts by the New York provincial government to establish its authority.  These included denying surveyors sent by the province the ability to survey ''any'' land in the Grants, not just land owned through the Wentworth grants.<ref name="Jellison50">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 50</ref>

[[Image:GreenMtBoys.jpg|thumb|left|The flag of the [[Green Mountain Boys]]]]
While Allen participated in some of the defensive actions to drive surveyors away, he also spent much time exploring the entire territory, probably ranging as far north as the site of [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]] in his wanderings.  After selling off some of his Connecticut properties, he began buying wild lands further north in the territory, which, as the southern settlements grew and people began to move further north, he sold at a profit.<ref name="Jellison56_7">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 56<U+2013>57</ref>

Friction with the provincial government rose notably when, in October 1771, Allen and a company of Boys drove off a group of Scottish settlers near [[Rupert, Vermont|Rupert]].  Allen detained two of the settlers and forced them to watch the torching of their newly-constructed cabins.  He then ordered them to leave, saying "Go your way now, and complain to that damned scoundrel your Governor, God damn your Governor, Laws, King, Council, and Assembly".<ref name="Jellison58">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 58</ref>   When the settlers protested his language, Allen continued the tirade, threatening to send any troops from New York to Hell.  In response, New York's governor, [[William Tryon]], issued warrants for the arrests of those responsible, and eventually put a price of <U+00A3>20 on the heads of six participants, including Allen.<ref name="Jellison59_60">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 59<U+2013>60</ref>  Allen and his cohorts countered by issuing offers of their own.
{{Quote box|align=right|width=30%|<U+00A3>25 REWARD<U+2014>Whereas James Duane and John Kempe, of New York, have by their menaces and threats greatly disturbed the public peace and repose of the honest peasants of Bennington and the settlements to the northward, which are now and ever have been in the peace of God and the King, and are patriotic and liege subjects of Geo. the 3rd. Any person that will apprehend these common disturbers, viz: James Duane and John Kempe, and bring them to Landlord Fay's at Bennington shall have <U+00A3>15 reward James Duane and <U+00A3>10 reward for John Kempe, paid by|Ethan Allen, Remember Baker, Robert Cochran<ref name="Jellison62">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 62</ref>}}

Over the next few years, the situation continued to deteriorate.  Governor Tryon and the Boys exchanged threats, truce offers, and other writings, which were frequently written by Allen in florid and didactic language, while the Boys continued to drive surveyors and incoming tenants on New York-granted lands away.  Most of these incidents did not involve bloodshed, although individuals were at times manhandled, and the Boys sometimes did extensive property damage when driving tenants out.  By March 1774, the harsh treatment of settlers and their property by Allen and the Boys prompted Tryon to increase the reward for them to <U+00A3>100 a head.<ref name="Jellison62_91">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 62<U+2013>91</ref>

===Onion River Company===
Allen persisted with actions against the New York-issued grantholders and their tenants, even though a number of the Wentworth proprietors were tiring of the business.  In 1772 he, his cousin Remember Baker, and his brothers Ira, Heman, and Zimri, formed the Onion River Company, which was basically a land-speculation organization devoted to purchasing land in and around the [[Winooski River]] (known then as the Onion River).  The success of this business depended on the successful defense of the Wentworth grants.  Early purchases of the company included about 40,000 acres of land from Edward Burling and his partners; land was sold at a profit to [[Thomas Chittenden]] among others, and the settlements on the company's land grew to become the city of [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]].<ref name="Jellison77_86">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 77<U+2013>86</ref>

The outrage of the Wentworth proprietors, however, was renewed when, in 1774, Governor Tryon passed the Outlawry Act, which contained harsh provisions clearly targeted at the actions of the "Bennington Mob".<ref name="Jellison92">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 92</ref>{{fact|date=March 2009|reason=need cite for Tryon or others using "Bennington Mob"}}  Vermont historian Samuel Williams called it "an act whcih for its savage barbarity is probably without parallel in the legislation of any civilized country".<ref name="Jellison92"/>   Its provisions included the penalty of death for interfering with a magistrate, and the criminalization of meetings of more than three people "for unlawful purposes" in the Grants.<ref name="Jellison92"/>  The Boys countered with rules of their own, forbidding anyone in the Grants from holding "any office of honor or profit under the colony of N. York".<ref name="Jellison94">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 94</ref>

Allen spent much of the summer of 1774 writing a "pamphlet" entitled ''A Brief Narrative of the Proceedings of the Government of New York Relative to Their Obtaining the Jurisdiction of that Large District of Land to the Westward of the Connecticut River''.  The length of the "pamphlet"'s name was justified; it was a 200-page polemic arguing the position of the Wentworth proprietors.<ref name="Jellison94_5">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp 94<U+2013>95</ref>  Allen had the work, which Jellison describes as "rebellion in print", printed in Connecticut, and began selling and giving away copies in early 1775.<ref name="Jellison96">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 96</ref>

===Westminster massacre===
In February 1775, Allen traveled into the northern parts of the Grants, as was his custom, for solitude, and to hunt game and land opportunities.<ref name="Jellison97">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 97</ref>  A few days after his return, news came that blood had finally been shed over the land disputes.  Most of the resistance activity had until then taken place on the the west side of the [[Green Mountains]]; on March 13, a small riot in the shire town of Westminster, on the east side of the mountains, resulted in the death of two men.<ref name="Jellison98_9">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 98<U+2013>99</ref>  Allen and a troop of Boys traveled to Westminster, where, under Allen's influence, the town's convention adopted a strongly-worded resolution authorizing the drafting of a plea to the King to remove them "out of so oppressive a jurisdiction".<ref name="Jellison99_0">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 99<U+2013>100</ref>  The preparation of the petition was assigned to a committee which included Allen.<ref name="Jellison100">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 100</ref>

Less than a week after the Westminster convention ended, while Allen and the committee worked on their petition, the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolution]] began.<ref name="Jellison101">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 101</ref>

==Early Revolutionary War==
===Capture of Fort Ticonderoga===
{{main|Capture of Fort Ticonderoga}}
In late April, following the [[battles of Lexington and Concord]], Allen received word from members of an irregular Connecticut militia that they were planning to [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|capture Fort Ticonderoga]], requesting his assistance in the effort.<ref name="Jellison109">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 109</ref>   Allen, whether motivated by patriotic impulses (as he describes in his account of the events), or by the realization that the action might improve the political position of his side in the grants disputes, agreed, and began rounding up the Green Mountain Boys.<ref name="Jellison102_4">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 102<U+2013>104</ref>  On May 2, 60 men from Massachusetts and Connecticut met with Allen in Bennington, where they discussed the logistics of the expedition.<ref name="Jellison109"/>  By May 7, these men joined Allen and 130 Boys at Castleton.  The next morning, Allen was elected to lead the expedition, and a dawn raid was planned for May 10. <ref name="Jellison110">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 110</ref> Two small companies were detached to procure boats, and Allen took the main contingent north to Hand's Cove in [[Shoreham, Vermont|Shoreham]] to prepare for the crossing.<ref name="Jellison111">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 111</ref>

On the afternoon of May 9, quite unexpectedly, [[Benedict Arnold]] arrived on the scene.  Flourishing his Massachusetts-issued colonel's commission, he asserted his right to command the expedition.  The assembled men refused to acknowledge his authority, inisisting they would only follow Allen's lead.<ref name="Jellison113">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 113</ref>  In a private discussion, Allen and Arnold reached an accomodation, the essence of which was that Arnold and Allen would both be at the front of the troop when the attack on the fort was made.<ref name="Jellison114">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 114</ref>

Around 2 am, a few boats were finally procured for the crossing.  However, only 83 men made it to the other side of the lake before Allen and Arnold, concerned that dawn was approaching, decided to attack.<ref name="Jellison115">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 115</ref>  At this point, Allen claims, in his account of the affair, to have made a speech to the men.  This is likely untrue, as it is not evidenced in journals kept by other participants.<ref name="Jellison116">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 116</ref>  Then, in the early dawn, the small force marched on the fort, surprising the lone sentry.  Allen went directly to the fort commander's quarters, seeking to force his surrender.   Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham, the assistant to the fort's commander, Captain William Delaplace, was awoken by the noise, and called to wake the captain.<ref name="Randall95">[[#Randall|Randall]], p. 95</ref>  Stalling for time, he demanded to know by what authority the fort was being entered. Allen, who later claimed that he said it to Captain Delaplace, said, "In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!"<ref name="Randall96">[[#Randall|Randall]], p. 96</ref>  Delaplace finally emerge from his chambers, fully dressed, and surrendered his sword.<ref name="Randall96"/>  The rest of the fort's garrison surrendered without firing a shot.<ref name="Jellison119">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 119</ref>

===Raids on St. John's===
A detachment of the boys under Seth Warner's command went to nearby [[Fort Crown Point]] and captured the small garrison there.<ref name="Jellison122">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 122</ref> On May 14, following the arrival of 100 men recruited by Arnold's captains, and the arrival of a [[schooner]] and some [[bateaux]] that had been taken at [[Whitehall (village), New York|Skenesboro]], Arnold and 50 of his men sailed north to raid [[Fort Saint-Jean (Quebec)|Fort St. John's]], on the [[Richelieu River]] downstream from the lake, where a small British warship was reported by the prisoners to be anchored.<ref name="Randall101">[[#Randall|Randall]], p. 101</ref><ref name="Smith155">[[#Smith14I|Smith]], p. 155</ref>  Arnold's raid was a success; he seized the sloop [[HMS ''Royal George'' (1776)|HMS ''Royal George'']], supplies, and a number of bateaux.<ref name="Smith157">[[#Smith14I|Smith]], p. 157</ref>

Allen, shortly after Arnold's departure on the raid, decided, after his successes at the southern end of the lake, to take and hold Fort St. John's himself.  To that end, he and about 100 Boys climbed into four bateaux, and began rowing north.<ref name="Jellison130">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 130</ref>  After two days without significant food (which they had forgotten to provision in the boats), Allen's small fleet met Arnold's on its way back to Ticonderoga near the foot of the lake.<ref name="Randall105">[[#Randall|Randall]], p. 105</ref>  Arnold generously opened his stores to Allen's hungry men, and tried to dissuade Allen from his objective, noting that it was likely the alarm had been raised and troops were on their way to St. John's.  Allen, likely both stubborn in his determination, and envious of Arnold, persisted.<ref name="Jellison129_0">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 129<U+2013>130</ref>

When Allen and his men landed above St. John's and scouted the situation, they learned that a column of 200 or more regulars was approaching.  Rather than attempt an ambush on those troops, which significantly outnumbered is tired company, Allen withdrew to the other side of the river, where the men collapsed with exhaustion and slept without sentries through the night.  They were awakened when British sentries discovered them and began firing grapeshot at them from across the river.  The Boys, in a panic, piled into their bateaux and rowed with all speed upriver.  When the expedition returned to Ticonderoga two days later, some of the men were greatly disappointed that they had nothing to show for the effort and risks they took.<ref name="Jellison130_1">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 130<U+2013>131</ref>

===Promoting an invasion===
Following Allen's failed attempt on St. John's, many of his men drifted away, presumably drawn by the needs of home and farm.  Arnold then began asserting his authority over Allen for control of Ticonderoga and Crown Point.  Allen publicly announced that he was stepping down as commander, but remained hopeful that the [[Second Continental Congress]] was going to name "a commander for this department ... Undoubtedly, we shall be rewarded according to our merit".<ref name="Jellison132">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 132</ref>  Congress, for its part, at first not really wanting any part of the affair, effectively voted to strip and then abandon the forts.  Both Allen and Arnold protested these measures, pointing out that doing so would leave the northern border wide open.<ref name="Jellison133_4">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 133<U+2013>134</ref>  They both also made proposals to Congress and other provincial bodies for carrying out an invasion of Quebec.  Allen, in one instance, wrote that "I will lay my life on it, that with fifteen hundred men, and a proper artillery, I will take [[Montreal]]".<ref name="Jellison134">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 134</ref>  Allen also attempted correspondence with the people of Quebec and with the Indians living there in an attempt to sway their opinion toward the revolutionary cause.<ref name="Jellison135_7">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 135<U+2013>137</ref>

On June 22, Allen and Seth Warner appeared before Congress in Philadelphia, where they argued for the inclusion of the Green Mountain Boys in the [[Continental Army]].  After deliberation, Congress directed General [[Philip Schuyler]], who had been appointed to lead the Army's Northern Department, to work with New York's provincial government to establish (and pay) a regiment consisting of the Boys, and that they be paid Army rates for their service at Ticonderoga.<ref name="Jellison138">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 138</ref>  On July 4, Allen and Warner made their case to New York's Provincial Congress, which, despite the fact that the Royal Governor had placed a price on their heads, agreed to the formation of a regiment.<ref name="Jellison139">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 139</ref>  Following a brief visit to his family, the returned to Bennington to spread the news, and Allen went to Ticonderoga to join Schuyler, while Warner and others raised the regiment.<ref name="Jellison141">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 141</ref>

===Allen loses command of the Boys===
When the regimental companies in the Grants had been raised, they held a vote in [[Dorset, Vermont|Dorset]] to determine who would command the regiment.  By a wide margin, Seth Warner was elected to lead the regiment.  Brothers Ira and Heman were also given command positions, but Ethan was not given any position at all in the regiment.<ref name="Jellison142">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 142</ref>  The thorough reject stung; Allen wrote to Connecticut's Governor Trumbull, "How the old men came to reject me I cannot conceive inasmuch as I saved them from the incroachments of New York."<ref name="Jellison143">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 143</ref>

The rejection likely had several causes. The people of the Grants were tired of the disputes with New York, and they were tired of Allen's posturing and egotistic behavior, which the success at Ticonderoga had enhanced.  Finally, the failure of the attempt on St. John's was widely seen as reckless and ill-advised, attributes they did not appreciate in a regimental leader.<ref name="Jellison144">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 144</ref>  Warner was viewed as a more stable and quieter choice, and was someone that also commanded respect.  The history of Warner's later actions in the revolution may be seen as a confirmation of the choice made by the Dorset meeting.<ref name="Jellison145">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 145</ref>

Ethan, in the end, took the rejection in stride, and managed to convince Schuyler and Warner to accompany the regiment as a civilian scout.<ref name="Jellison146">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 146</ref>

===Capture===
[[Image:EthanAllenBeforePrescott1775.jpeg|thumb|right|Engraving depicting Allen before his captors in [[Montreal]]]]
{{see also|Invasion of Canada (1775)|Battle of Longue-Pointe}}

The American invasion of [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Quebec]] departed from Ticonderoga on August 28.  On September 4, the army had occupied the [[<U+00CE>le aux Noix]] in the Richelieu River, a few miles above Fort St. John's, which they then [[Siege of Fort Saint-Jean|prepared to besiege]].<ref name="Smith322_4">[[#Smith14I|Smith]], pp. 322<U+2013>324</ref>  On September 8, Schuyler sent Allen and Massachusetts Major [[John Brown of Pittsfield|John Brown]], who had also been involved in the capture of Ticonderoga, into the countryside between St. John's and Montreal to spread the word of their arrival to the [[habitant]]s and the Indians.<ref name="Lanctot65">[[#Lanctot|Lanctot]], p. 65</ref>  They were successful enough in gaining support from the habitants that Quebec's governor, General [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]], reported that "they have injured us very much".<ref name="Jellison151">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], p. 151</ref>

On his return from that expedition 8 days later, General [[Richard Montgomery]], who had assumed command of the invasion due to Schuyler's instance, likely not wanting the troublemaker in his camp, again sent him out, this time to raise a regiment of [[Canadien]]s.  Accompanied by a small number of Americans, he again set out, traveling through the countryside to [[Sorel, Quebec|Sorel]], before turning to follow the [[Saint Lawrence River]] up toward Montreal, recruiting upwards of 200 men.<ref name="Jellison151_2">[[#Jellison|Jellison]], pp. 151<U+2013>152</ref>

On September 24, he and Brown, whose company was guarding the road between St. John's and Montreal, met at [[Longueuil, Quebec|Longueuil]], and came up with a plan to attack Montreal.  Allen and about 100 men crossed the Saint Lawrence that night, but Brown and his men, who were to cross the river at [[Laprairie, Quebec|Laprairie]], did not.  General Carleton, alerted to Allen's presence, mustered every man he could, and, in the [[Battle of Longue-Pointe]], scattered most of Allen's force, and captured him and about 30 men.<ref name="Lanctot77_8">[[#Lanctot|Lanctot]], pp. 77<U+2013>78</ref>

His capture ended his participation in the revolution until 1778, as he was imprisoned by the British.

==Imprisonment==
Allen was shipped to England and imprisoned in [[Pendennis Castle]], [[Cornwall]], where he suffered considerable mistreatment.  Not wishing to hang Allen because of political repercussions, the British returned him to North America. Arriving at Halifax in June 1776, Allen was paroled in New York City in October where, with the financial assistance of his brother Ira, he lived comfortably, if out of action, until the spring of 1778.<ref name="Boatner">{{cite book |last=Boatner |first=Mark M. |title=Encyclopedia of the American Revolution |pages=17<U+2013>18}}</ref>

That spring, Allen was jailed for a parole violation that he admitted was "partly true".<ref name="Boatner"/>  On May 3, 1778 Ethan Allen was marched to [[New York Harbor]] and compelled to board a [[sloop]] to [[Staten Island]]. He was there admitted to [[John Campbell of Strachur|General Campbell<U+2019>s]] quarters and invited to eat and drink with the general and several other British [[field officer]]s. Allen stayed there for two days and was treated politely. On the third day Allen was exchanged for Colonel [[Archibald Campbell (British Army officer)|Archibald Campbell]], who was conducted to the exchange by Colonel [[Elias Boudinot]], the American [[commissary general]] of prisoners appointed by General [[George Washington]].  Following the exchange, Allen reported to Washington at Valley Forge.  On May 14, he was breveted a colonel in the Continental Army in "reward of his fortitude, firmness and zeal in the cause of his country, manifested during his long and cruel captivity, as well as on former occasions."<ref name="Boatner"/>

==Vermont independence==
Allen then moved back to Vermont, which had become a hotbed of malcontent, harboring little affection for either the British or for the nascent United States.  Vermont was also harboring a significant number of deserters from the armies of both. Allen settled a [[homestead (buildings)|homestead]] in the [[River delta|delta]] of the [[Winooski River]] in what became the modern city of [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]]. Allen became active in Vermont politics and was appointed a major general of the Vermont militia in 1779, using the position to harass New York settlers as part of the New Hampshire Grants controversy between New York, New Hampshire and the Continental Congress.<ref name="Boatner" />

In 1778, Allen appeared before the [[Continental Congress]] on behalf of a claim by Vermont for recognition as an independent [[U.S. state|state]]. Due to the New York (and New Hampshire) claim on Vermont, Congress was reluctant to grant independent statehood to Vermont. Allen then negotiated with the governor of [[Canada]] between 1780 and 1783 in order to establish Vermont as a British [[province]] and to gain military protection for its residents. Because of this, the US charged him with treason; however, because the negotiations were demonstrably intended to force action on the Vermont case by the Continental Congress, the charge was never substantiated.

==Second marriage==

Ethan met his second wife, a [[widow]], Frances Montresor Brush Buchanan, in 1784.  They married within a few months on February 16, 1784.  They had three children:
* [[Fanny Allen|Fanny]] (1784<U+2013>1819)
* Hannibal Allen (1786<U+2013>1813)
* Ethan Allen Jr. (1787<U+2013>1855)

==Death==
Allen died 22 days after his birthday on February 12, 1789, at the age of 51, in Burlington, Vermont.  He was buried in Green Mount Cemetery, Burlington, Vermont.<ref>[http://jrm.phys.ksu.edu/Genealogy/Needham/d0004/I467.html I467: Ethan B. ALLEN (1738<U+2013>1789)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
