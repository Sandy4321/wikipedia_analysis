'''''Homerun''''' ([[Written Chinese|Chinese]]: <U+8DD1><U+5427><U+FF01><U+5B69><U+5B50> [[pinyin]]: p<U+01CE>o b<U+00E0> h<U+00E1>i z<U+01D0>) is a 2002 [[Singapore]]an [[film]]. A remake of the award-winning [[Iran]]ian film ''[[Children of Heaven]]'', ''Homerun'' is a comedy about two poor siblings and their adventures over a lost pairs of [[shoes]]. The movie emphasises the importance of friends and kinship. Set in 1965, the year Singapore [[Singapore in Malaysia#Seperation|separated from]] [[Malaysia]], the film satirises [[Foreign relations of Singapore#Malaysia|political relations between the two countries]], leading to its [[Censorship in Malaysia|banning]] in Malaysia.

The movie was written and directed by acclaimed Singaporean film-maker [[Jack Neo]], and produced by [[MediaCorp Raintree Pictures]]. It stars [[Huang Wenyong]], [[Xiang Yun]], [[Shawn Lee]] and [[Megan Zheng]]. Filming took place in the rural outskirts of [[Kuala Lumpur]] during November and December 2002, but [[Filmmaking#Post-production|post-production]] delays pushed back the film's release date.

Released in [[cinema (place)|cinema]]s on [[7 August]] [[2003]], ''Homerun'' grossed over [[S$]]2.3 million during its nine-week [[box office]] run. It was nominated for two awards at the 2003 [[Golden Horse Awards]]; Megan Zheng, then 10, became the first Singaporean to win a Golden Horse. Generally, however, [[film criticism|critical reception]] of the movie was mixed.

==Plot==
Set in [[1965]], the film's storyline revolves around the lives, family and friends of two poor [[Singapore]]an children, Chew Kiat Kun ([[Shawn Lee]]) and his younger sister Seow Fang ([[Megan Zheng]]). With their father ([[Huang Wenyong]]) in debt to a local rice merchant ([[Richard Low]]), and their mother ([[Xiang Yun]]) late in her third pregnancy, the family struggles to make ends meet. The children make the best of what little they have, while their father works long hours doing odd jobs.

The family's problems are compounded when Kiat Kun accidentally loses Seow Fang's only pair of [[shoes]] after taking them to be repaired. The children conduct a frantic search but find nothing; a [[karung guni|karung guni man]] had claimed the shoes as unwanted rubbish. The Chew siblings are frustrated by the situation until their father inspires Kiat Kun to share his shoes with his sister, trading off between classes so they can both attend school. Unfortunately, this plan brings additional problems: Seow Fang is chastised for wearing oversized shoes to school, while Kiat Kun is repeatedly late as he must wait for his sister to exchange shoes with him.

[[Image:Homerun screenshot 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kiat Kun's friends and Beng Soon's friends arguing after an agreement is reneged on, in a political allusion.<ref name="noneed"/>]]

At school, a wealthy schoolmate of Kiat Kun's named Tan Beng Soon ([[Joshua Ang]]) runs a [[football (soccer)|football]] team with his friends. Kiat Kun and his friends strike a bargain with Beng Soon to play on the team using the other boys' football shoes, in exchange for helping them cheat on their homework. However, the boys quarrel, causing an angry Beng Soon to renege on the deal and remove Kiat Kun and his friends from the team. 

Without their assistance, Beng Soon and his friends are punished for producing substandard homework. Although the boys try to resolve their differences, they eventually give up on reaching an agreement. Beng Soon's grades continue to fall, and his parents decide to send him to study in England.

Meanwhile, Seow Fang sees her classmate wearing her lost shoes to school. She and Kiat Kun follow the girl home, but after realising her father is blind, they decide not to reclaim the shoes. However, a few days later, Seow Fang notices that her classmate is wearing a new pair; upon confronting her, she discovers that the girl has discarded the old pair at the [[kampung]] rubbish dump. The Chew siblings frantically search the rubbish dump for her shoes, but only discover them as they are destroyed during a [[trade union]]ist riot.

[[Image:Homerun screenshot 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The climax of the film, in which Kiat Kun is pushed to the limit but trips and finishes first &mdash; a parallel to Singapore's political history.<ref name="historyworkroom"/>]]

Kiat Kun is dejected until he learns that the third prize in the 1965 National Primary School Cross Country Competition is a pair of shoes. Because he was sick on the day his school selected representatives for the race, he pleads with his [[physical education|P.E.]] teacher to let him enter. The teacher, initially reluctant, relents when Kiat Kun rushes to get his cough medicine, demonstrating his running ability. As the competition begins, Kiat Kun notices that Beng Soon is also participating.

Once the starting gun fires, Kiat Kun pushes himself to the limit and eventually establishes himself among the lead runners. Kiat Kun appears assured of third place, but trips on a stone and finishes first; Beng Soon ends the race in third place. While Kiat Kun is running, Mrs Chew goes into labour, forcing Seow Fang to run across a long path littered with broken glass to find a midwife. Finally, Mrs Chew gives birth to a healthy baby boy and Beng Soon gives Kiat Kun and Seow Fang new pairs of shoes before going to study in England.

==Political commentary==

Elements of ''Homerun'' compare and contrast Singapore's situations in 1965 and in 2003. For example, while Mrs Chew is giving birth, [[Lee Kuan Yew]]'s voice can be heard on a radio in the background, announcing Singapore's [[Singapore in Malaysia|separation from Malaysia]].<ref name="historyworkroom">{{cite web| first = Stephanie| title = Homerun as history| publisher = The History Workroom| date = 2007-06-11| url = http://historyworkroom.com/?p=23| accessdate = 2008-03-08 }}</ref> Other events in the movie parallel those in Singapore's history, such as the riot at the rubbish dump alluding to the [[Self-governance of Singapore#Partial internal self-government (1955<U+2013>1959)|labour strikes and riots]] of the 1960s,<ref name="historyworkroom"/> as well as the threat of [[terrorism]] in the new millennium.<ref name="kidding"/> One of Kiat Kun's friends is nicknamed "[[Little Red Dot]]",<ref name="filmsasia">{{cite web| last = Hsiang| first = Wong Lung| coauthors = Soh Yun-Huei| title = Homerun| publisher = Films Asia| url = http://www.filmsasia.net/gpage155.html| accessdate = 2008-03-08}}</ref> a phrase used by former [[Indonesia]]n president [[Jusuf Habibie]] to disparage Singapore.<ref>{{cite web| title = Sound relations with Malaysia vital, says Hsien Loong| publisher = Utusan Online| date = 2003-05-03| url = http://pgoh13.free.fr/spore_vital.html| accessdate = 2008-03-08 }}</ref> The final scene in the movie shows the Chew siblings standing before a long muddy path, which symbolises the uncertainly faced by both the [[History of the Republic of Singapore#1966 to 1979|newly independent nation]] in 1965 and the [[History of the Republic of Singapore#1966 to 1979#The 2000 - present|country in transition]] in 2003.<ref name="kidding"/>

A number of scenes in ''Homerun'' contain references to [[Singapore-Malaysia relations|political disputes between]] Singapore and [[Malaysia]]. The [[Water conflicts between Malaysia and Singapore|water dispute]] is portrayed by Kiat Kun (Singapore) quarrelling with Beng Soon (Malaysia) over the right to draw water from the kampung well.<ref name="hopenoban">{{cite news  | title = Homerun producers hope movie will be screened intact in Malaysia| publisher = ''[[Channel NewsAsia]]''| date = 2003-09-03}}</ref><ref name="malaysiaban">{{cite news | title = Malaysia to ban Jack Neo's Homerun| publisher = ''[[The Sunday Times (Singapore)|The Sunday Times]]''| date = 2003-09-14}}</ref><ref name="noneed">{{cite news | last = Ho| first = Karl| title = No need to ban Homerun| publisher = ''[[The Straits Times]]''| date = 2003-09-17}}</ref> In another scene, one of Kiat Kun's friends produces a sheet of paper with details of the deal Beng Soon reneged on, prompting one of Beng Soon's friends to remark that this was like "writing a letter to a girlfriend and revealing it to the world". This echoes a comment made by Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]], comparing Singapore's disclosure of letters between the two countries to "revealing letters sent to one's girlfriend".<ref name="noneed"/> When asked about the references, Jack Neo said: "I'll leave this to the audience's imagination".<ref name="malaysiaban"/>

On [[12 September]] [[2003]], [[Censorship in Malaysia|Malaysian censors]] announced their decision to ban the screening of ''Homerun'' in Malaysia,<ref name="malaysiaban"/><ref name="noneed"/><ref name="klban">{{cite news | title = KL SLAPS BAN ON S'PORE'S HOMERUN| publisher = ''[[Bernama|Bernama Daily]]''| date = 2003-09-13}} </ref> citing scenes which "are easily interpreted by some Malaysian audiences' [sic] as containing political elements related to current issues".<ref name="noneed"/> Raintree filed an appeal,<ref name="malaysiaban"/><ref name="noneed"/><ref name="klban"/> arguing that the positive messages in the film were more salient than the political satire,<ref name="hopenoban"/><ref name="klban"/> but it was unsuccessful. Malaysian moviegoers polled by ''[[Life!]]'' and the ''[[China Press]]'' expressed disappointment with the ban, calling it "unnecessary" and stated a desire to watch the film via [[copyright infringement|pirated VCD]].<ref name="noneed"/>

==Reception==

Critical reception of ''Homerun'' was mixed. Sanjuro of LoveHKFilm.com wrote that the movie "succeeds in delivering a relatively simple, intimate story that should prove moving for even the most jaded audience",<ref>{{cite web| first = Sanjuro | title = Homerun (Singapore 2003)| publisher = LoveHKFilm| date = 2005| url = http://lovehkfilm.com/panasia/homerun.htm| accessdate = 2008-03-09}}</ref> while Nick England of the [[San Diego Asian Film Festival|San Diego Asian Film Foundation]] described ''Homerun'' as "a film with certain beauteous qualities that we can genuinely enjoy, but end up choking on when it is all over with".<ref>{{cite web| last = England| first = Nick | title = 'Homerun' a solid double but no dinger| publisher = San Diego Asian Film Foundation| url = http://www.sdaff.org/features_view.php?news_id=83| accessdate = 2008-03-09}}</ref> In contrast, FilmsAsia reviewer Soh Yun-Huei panned its use of political satire, which she felt "[causes] the film to be devoid of innocence and replaced with a sense of agenda and manipulation".<ref name="filmsasia"/>
