==Arrest for quoting Churchill==
On April 26, 2014 Paul Weston was arrested on the steps of the [[Winchester]] Guildhall for breaching a Section 27 Dispersal Notice as he was reading out a passage from [[Winston Churchill]]'s 1899 book ''[[The River War]]'' that is critical of Islam.<ref name=tele>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10792895/Election-candidate-arrested-over-Churchill-speech.html|title=Election candidate arrested over Churchill speech|author=Martin Evans|date=April 28, 2014|newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref> He had been reported to the police by a member of the public after they had asked him if he had permission to give the speech and he replied that he did not. At the police station Weston was then rearrested for a Racially Aggravated Crime after the breach of Section 27 had been dropped.<ref>{{cite news|title=Paul Weston could face 2 years in jail for quoating Churchill |date= April 28, 2014 | url=http://libertygb.org.uk/v1/index.php/home/root/news-libertygb/6390-video-paul-weston-could-face-2-years-in-jail-for-quoting-churchill|publisher=Liberty GP}}</ref> The passage read out by Weston can be seen below.

<blockquote>How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property <U+2013> either as a child, a wife, or a concubine <U+2013> must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.<ref>Winston S. Churchill, The River War, First edition, Vol. II (London: Longmans, Green & Co., 1899), pp. 248<U+2013>250.</ref></blockquote>

In Weston's speech the term '[[Mohammedanism]]' is replaced with '[[Islam]]' and, at no point, until arrested, did Weston identify the words as a passage from Churchill's book. After the arrest took place Paul Weston told an interviewer: "I was never actually going to mention it at all, if I hadn't been arrested I would have mentioned that it was Winston Churchill, having been arrested, I thought, there is absolutely no point informing the police about this because they will then perhaps be slightly less forward in taking action; and I thought, if it really has come to the point where you can be arrested for saying these words then don't tell them who originally said it. And let them prosecute you, arrest you, prosecute you, just to show the rest of the world how utterly sunk this poor old country of Britain is today."<ref>Paul Weston Interview April 27th 2014 | April 27 2014 | http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQzV_-latew</ref> The story was picked up by [[ITV News]]<ref name=itv140428>{{cite news|title=Euro election candidate arrested after quoting Churchill | date=April 28, 2014 |url= http://www.itv.com/news/update/2014-04-28/euro-elections-candidate-arrested-over-hate-speech/}}</ref>, [[The Daily Telegraph]]<ref name=tele/>, [[Fox News]]<ref>{{cite news|title=British politician arrested after speech quoting Churchill<U+2019>s take on Islam | date=April 29, 2014 | url= http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/04/29/british-politician-arrested-after-speech-quoting-churchills-take-on-islam/|newspaper=FoxNews}}</ref>, and [[The Daily Mail]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Arrested for Quoting Winston Churchill | date=April 28, 2014 | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2614834/Arrested-quoting-Winston-Churchill-European-election-candidate-accused-religious-racial-harassment-repeats-wartime-prime-ministers-words-Islam-campaign-speech.html|author=Lizzie Parry}}</ref>

In the days after [[Daniel Hannan]], the [[MEP]] for [[South East England (European Parliament constituency)|South East England]], whom Weston was running against at the time, wrote in his ''[[Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'' blog: "Why should it fall to me to defend him? Where are the lion-hearted liberals who are so quick to denounce political arrests in distant dictatorships? I realise that 'political arrest' is a strong phrase, but it's hard to think of any other way to describe a candidate for public office being taken into police custody because of objections to the content of his pitch."<ref>{{cite news|author=Daniel Hannan | title=Britain has just witnessed a political arrest.
