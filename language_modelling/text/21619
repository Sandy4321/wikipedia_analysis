'''Wasalu Muhammad Jaco''' (born February 16, 1982), better known by his stage name '''Lupe Fiasco''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|l|u<U+02D0>|p|e<U+026A>}} {{respell|LOO|pay}}), is an American [[rapper]], [[record producer]], and [[entrepreneur]]. As an [[entrepreneur]], Lupe is the [[chief executive officer]] of 1st and 15th Entertainment. He rose to fame in 2006 following the success of his debut album, ''[[Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor]]''. He also performs as the frontman of [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Japanese Cartoon (band)|Japanese Cartoon]] under his real name.

Raised in [[Chicago]], Fiasco developed an interest in [[hip hop music|hip hop]] after initially disliking the genre for its use of [[vulgarity]]. After adopting the name Lupe Fiasco and recording songs in his father's basement, 19-year-old Fiasco joined a group called Da Pak. The group disbanded shortly after its inception, and Fiasco soon met rapper [[Jay-Z]] who helped him sign a record deal with [[Atlantic Records]]. In 2006, Fiasco released his debut album ''Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor'' on the label, which received three [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations. He released his second album, ''[[Lupe Fiasco's The Cool]]'', in December 2007. The lead single "[[Superstar (Lupe Fiasco song)|Superstar]]" peaked at number 10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. He released ''[[Lasers (album)|Lasers]]'' on March 8, 2011 after a two-year delay.

In addition to music, Fiasco has pursued other business ventures, including fashion. He runs two clothing lines, Righteous Kung-Fu and Trilly & Truly; he has designed sneakers for [[Reebok]]. He has been involved with charitable activities, including the Summit on the Summit expedition, and in 2010 he recorded a benefit single for victims of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]]. Fiasco is also noted for his [[anti-establishment]] views, which he has expressed in both interviews and his music.

===1999<U+2013>2005: Career beginnings===
[[File:Lupe Fiasco 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Lupe Fiasco performing at the [[Intonation Music Festival]], 2006.]]
When Fiasco was 17, he began creating music as a solo artist in his father's basement, even though his parents were not keen on having their son be a rapper. He scoured flea markets and secondhand stores, where he was able to find an old [[mixing board]] and a [[record player]], stacks of [[vinyl records]], and mic stands.<ref name="Biography Today, p.61"/>  At age 19, Fiasco joined a group called Da Pak, which was influenced by other California [[gangsta rap]]pers such as [[Spice 1]] and [[Ice Cube]]. Da Pak signed to [[Epic Records]] and released one single before splitting up.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> Fiasco later described the experience, saying "We had a song out about cocaine, guns, and women, and I would go to a record store and look at it and think, 'What are you doing?' I felt like a hypocrite. I was acting like this rapper who would never be judged, and I had to destroy that guy. Because what Lupe Fiasco says on this microphone is going to come back to Wasalu Jaco. When the music cuts off, you have to go home and live with what you say."<ref>"Biography Today", pp.61<U+2013>62</ref> 

After turning away from gangsta rap, he developed a greater appreciation of the lyricism of [[Jay-Z]] and Nas. His mother also gave him a record of the influential group [[The Watts Prophets]], one of the first bands to use spoken words with music.<ref name="Biography Today, p.62">"Biography Today", p.62</ref>  Although he was without a group for the first time, Fiasco continued to record music. One of these first self-recorded tracks was "Could Have Been", which described the career options he could have pursued had he not begun rapping.<ref name="Blues&Soul">{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/646/return_of_the_cool/|title=Lupe Fiasco: 'Paris, Tokyo'|last=Lewis|first=Pete|date=March 3, 2008|accessdate=April 16, 2008|work=[[Blues & Soul]]|publisher=Blues & Soul Publications, Inc.}}</ref>  He viewed the song as a turning point in his career that marked a drastic change in the subject matter of his music.<ref name="Blues&Soul"/>  "Could Have Been" was released as a demo tape and discovered by [[MTV]] despite the fact that no video was created for the song.<ref name="Blues&Soul"/>

Fiasco later signed a solo deal with [[Arista Records]], but was dropped when president and CEO [[L.A. Reid]] was fired.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> During his short tenure at Arista, he met Jay-Z, who was the president of [[Def Jam Recordings]] at the time. Jay-Z referred to him as a "breath of fresh air", saying that he reminded him of a younger version of himself.<ref name="Biography Today, p.62"/> Jay-Z later helped him get a record deal at [[Atlantic Records]].<ref name="Biography Today, p.62"/> While Fiasco was working on his debut solo album, he released his mixtape series ''Fahrenheit 1/15'' over the internet, which gained notoriety by word-of-mouth.  At this time, Fiasco's remix of [[Kanye West]]'s "[[Jesus Walks]]" entitled "Muhammad Walks", became very popular in the Muslim community.<ref>"Biography Today", pp.62<U+2013>63</ref>  

He remixed another one of West's songs, "[[Diamonds from Sierra Leone]]", and renamed it as "Conflict Diamonds".

He explains, "The store is where everything is at...Food to me represents growth and progression. You eat food and you get strength. You need it to live. Liquor is not a necessity; it is a want. It destroys you. It breaks you down. I can see why it's prohibited in Islam...I've always felt like liquor represents the bad, the food represents the good, and everyone is made up of a little of both."<ref>"Biography Today", p.64</ref>  ''Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor'' was officially released on September 19, 2006.

While waiting for ''Lasers'' to be released, Fiasco completed another album, titled ''Food and Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album''.<ref name="Ahmed">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/blogs/2010/09/08/interview-lupe-fiasco-talks-lasers-delay-japanese-cartoon-and-food-liquor-ii/|title=Interview: Lupe Fiasco Talks "Lasers" Delay, Japanese Cartoon, and "Food & Liquor II"|last=Ahmed|first=Insanul|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|publisher=Complex Media|date=November 8, 2010|accessdate=December 7, 2010}}</ref>  He is unsure if the ''Food and Liquor II'' will ever be released, though he released the song "Go To Sleep" from the record "out of desperation" to put out new music.<ref name="Ahmed"/> He also pursued numerous side projects in the midst of the delay.

Japanese Cartoon was influenced by a variety of musical genres, with Fiasco saying, "I<U+2019>ve always been a fan of all music...Hip hop is just something I actually know how to do but I always had aspirations to participate in other forms of music. Once I got to create some hip hop, it was like, 'Okay, what am I going to do now?' So my artistic side was like, 'Yo, let's do some rock music.'"<ref name="Ahmed"/>

More than two and a half years after the album's completion, ''Lasers'' was released March 8, 2011.

==Lyrical style==
Fiasco, along with rappers [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Rhymefest]], and [[Talib Kweli]], has been credited as a pioneer of the [[conscious hip hop]] movement, which focuses on social issues.<ref name="Plenty to Say">{{cite news|title=Plenty to say|last=Neems|first=Jeff|work=[[Waikato Times]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=December 16, 2006|accessdate=December 10, 2011}}</ref>  Subjects touched upon on ''Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor'' include [[Single parent|absent parents]], [[terrorism]], [[Islam]] and [[religion]], [[war]], and [[prostitution]].<ref name="Plenty to Say"/>  Fiasco attributes his interest in social issues to his highly cultured upbringing, as he describes his mother as "very intellectual" and his father as a "[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]".<ref name="Plenty to Say"/>  He rejects the [[misogyny]] [[Misogyny in hip hop culture|common in hip hop]], which he discusses in the song "[[Hurt Me Soul]]".<ref name="Euphoria">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/16/entertainment/et-fiasco16|title=Fiasco moves them to the brink of euphoria|last=Weiss|first=Jeff|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=January 16, 2008|accessdate=December 9, 2011}}</ref>  Despite this, Fiasco is strongly opposed to [[censorship]] in music: "If we're going to [censor things] that are offensive, then we are going to have to blind and deafen everyone. Come on, man. Let's focus on education and literacy and poverty."<ref name="Offensive">{{cite news|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/article/day-of-outrage-targets-offensive-lyrics-in-hip-hop/|title='Day of Outrage' targets offensive lyrics in hip-hop|last=Ahmed|first=Azam|date=August 7, 2007|accessdate=December 10, 2011|work=The Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Company}}</ref> 

Fiasco mixes various lyrical techniques in his songwriting.  The rapper views hip-hop as a medium conducive to [[storytelling]], a primary element of his lyrics due to his background in theater.<ref name="Plenty to Say"/>  He wrote [[Play (theatre)|plays]] as a child, which had a strong effect on his songwriting approaches.<ref name="Plenty to Say"/>  Fiasco utilizes both [[Metaphor|metaphors]] and literal statements in his work, which he describes as "getting from point A to point B in as few words as possible".<ref name="Plenty to Say"/>  His use of metaphors is exemplified by the song "Gotta Eat" from ''Lupe Fiasco's The Cool'', which is told from the perspective of a [[cheeseburger]] and addresses the poor nutrition in black communities in the United States.<ref name="SF Weekly"/>

==Philanthropy and business ventures==
In 2001, Fiasco co-founded 1st & 15th Entertainment with Charles "Chilly" Patton. 1st & 15th is a [[vanity record label]] under [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] named after the traditional twice-monthly paycheck dates.<ref name="Biography Today, p.62"/>  Although Fiasco was initially to serve as vice-president, he became CEO after Patton was convicted on drug charges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphoprx.com/2007/06/04/lupe-fiascos-record-label-partner-sentenced-to-44-years-denies-involvement-in-drug-ring/ |title=Lupe Fiasco's Record Label Partner Sentenced To 44 Years, Denies Involvement In Drug Ring |work=Hip Hop Rx |date=June 4, 2007 |accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=10554 |title=Lupe Fiasco<U+2019>s Business Partner Sentenced to 44 Years in Drug Case |work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]] |publisher=[[Harris Publications]]|date=June 4, 2007|accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref> Fiasco and singer [[Matthew Santos]] were two of the most recognizable signed artists. In November 2009, Fiasco announced he would discontinue the 1st & 15th label: "It was just such a 'this isn't right for you right now. This isn't gonna work for you right now.
