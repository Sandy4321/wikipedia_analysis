'''Dacre Castle''' is a [[moat]]ed [[tower house]] in the village of [[Dacre, Cumbria|Dacre]], {{convert|4|mi}} south-west of [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]], [[Cumbria]]. It was constructed in the mid-14th century, probably by [[Margaret de Multon, 2nd Baroness Multon of Gilsland|Margaret Multon]], against the background of the threat of Scottish invasion and raids, and was held in the Dacre family until the 17th century. The tower house is {{convert|66|ft}} tall, built out of local [[sandstone]], topped by [[crenellate|crenellations]], with four turrets protruding from a central block, and includes an ornate [[lavabo]] in the main hall. Renovated during the 1670s and 1960s after periods of disrepair, the castle is now used as a private home.

==History==
Dacre Castle was probably built by [[Margaret de Multon, 2nd Baroness Multon of Gilsland|Margaret Multon]], the wife of [[Ralph Dacre, 1st Baron Dacre|Ralph Dacre]], in the middle of the 14th century.<ref name="Emery 1996 204<U+2013>205">{{harvnb|Emery|1996|pp=204<U+2013>205}}</ref> The Dacre family had risen in prominence in Cumbria during the 12th and early 13th centuries, and William Dacre, Ralph's father, had acquired a [[licence to crenellate]] the property of Dunmallogt in 1307, quite close to the future site of Dacre Castle.<ref name=Emery1996P204>{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=204}}</ref> Ralph married Margaret in 1317, becoming extremely wealth as a result, and received permission to found [[Naworth Castle]] in 1335.<ref name=Emery1996P204/> Margaret built Dacre Castle at some point between Ralph's death in 1339 and 1354, with the intention of creating a fortified home.<ref name="Emery 1996 204<U+2013>205"/> Many tower houses were built across the region during the period in response to the threat of Scottish raids and invasions.<ref>{{harvnb|Pounds|1994|pp=286<U+2013>287}}</ref> There may have been an older building already on the site, possibly [[moat]]ed, but this is uncertain.<ref name=Emery1996P204/>

After Margaret's death, the castle continued to be owned by the Dacre family until the death of Randal Dacre in 1634, when it passed briefly to the Crown.<ref name=Emery1996P205>{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=205}}</ref> By 1675 the castle had become derelict and was restored by the then [[Lord Dacre]], [[Thomas Lennard, 1st Earl of Sussex|Thomas Lennard]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mackenzie|1896|p=309}}; {{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=204}}; {{harvnb|Pettifer|2002|p=40}}</ref> A new entrance to the castle was constructed and square, 17th-century windows installed.<ref>{{harvnb|Mackenzie|1896|p=309}}; {{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=204}}</ref> After Thomas's death in 1715 the castle was sold to Edward Hassell.<ref>{{harvnb|Lysons|Lysons|1816|p=89}}; {{harvnb|Murray|1869|p=83}}</ref> The condition of the castle deteriorated again in the 18th century, becoming overgrown and dilapidated, and by the 19th century the Hassell family were using it as a farmhouse.<ref>{{harvnb|Lysons|Lysons|1816|p=89}}; {{harvnb|Murray|1869|p=83}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1221000 | title=List Entry Summary: Moated Site of Dacre Castle | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=English Heritage}}</ref>

In 1961, the castle was leased for 22 years by Anthony and Bunty Kinsman, at a cost of <U+00A3>1,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Kinsman|1971|pp=3, 10}}</ref> The property required extensive structural repairs and renovations in order to be made habitable, which the Kinsmans undertook over the next two years. The construction work cost <U+00A3>8,596, and some financial support was provided by the Ministry of Works in exchange for the castle being opened to the public for the next fifteen years.<ref>{{harvnb|Kinsman|1971|pp=4<U+2013>7, 10, 17, 64}}</ref> The new oak doors in the castle were fitted with iron hinges that had originally been used in nearby [[Lowther Castle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kinsman|1971|p=19}}</ref> In 1967, the castle was visited by Princess Sharada Shah, the daughter of the King [[Mahendra of Nepal]], as part of an official trip to the UK.<ref>{{harvnb|Kinsman|1971|p=115}}</ref>

In the 21st century the castle is owned by the Hassell-McCosh family and is rented out as a private home.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cwherald.com/a/archive/ghost-of-chance-to-see-something-special-during-castle-open-days.325885.html | title=Ghost of Chance to See Something Special During Castle Open Days | date= 1 May 2009| separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=Cumberland and Westmoreland Herald}}</ref> It is protected under UK law as a [[grade I listed building]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1221000 | title=List Entry Summary: Moated Site of Dacre Castle | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=English Heritage}}</ref>

==Architecture==
Dacre Castle lies in a valley, overlooking a stream and fields.<ref name=EmeryPettiferP204P40>{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=204}}; {{harvnb|Pettifer|2002|p=40}}</ref> It comprises a [[tower house]] surrounded by a three-sided moat, creating an enclosed courtyard to the east {{convert|73|m}} by {{convert|55|m}} across.<ref name=EmeryPettiferP204P40/> The moat is between {{convert|9|m}} to {{convert|15|m}} wide and up to {{convert|4.5|m}} deep, with a protective bank on the south and west sides; originally a wall would have surrounded the outside of the courtyard.<ref>{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=204}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1221000 | title=List Entry Summary: Moated Site of Dacre Castle | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=English Heritage}}</ref> The courtyard originally held various buildings, possibly stables and offices, but the tower house was designed to operate independently, without the need for attached facilities.<ref>{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=204}}; {{harvnb|Mackenzie|1896|p=310}}; {{harvnb|Pounds|1994|p=287}}</ref> Architecturally, the design of Dacre resembles [[Harewood Castle|Harewood]] and [[Langley Castle]]s.<ref name=Emery1996P204/>

The tower house is in the north-east corner of the enclosure and takes the form of a square, central block, with two large turrets on one side and two smaller turrets resembling angular [[buttress]]es on the other.<ref name=EmeryP204MackenzieP310>{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=204}}; {{harvnb|Mackenzie|1896|p=310}}</ref> It is made of large blocks of local [[sandstone]] and the roof is [[crenellate]]d.<ref>{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=205}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1221000 | title=List Entry Summary: Moated Site of Dacre Castle | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=12 October 2013 |publisher=English Heritage}}</ref> The central block is {{convert|36|ft}} by {{convert|20|ft}} inside, and is {{convert|66|ft}} tall, with {{convert|8.5|ft}} thick walls.<ref name=EmeryP204MackenzieP310/> The building was originally entered through the south-west turret on the ground-floor, but since the 17th century the entrance way has been directly into the central block up an exterior staircase.<ref name=Emery1996P204/>

The ground floor of the central block contains two vaulted chambers and the first-floor forms a hall containing an ornate [[lavabo]], with smaller chambers in the turrets.<ref>{{harvnb|Kinsman|1971|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=204}}</ref> The second floor similarly forms a single large chamber, {{convert|17|ft}} high, with rooms in each of the adjacent turrets, and is traditionally called the "Room of the Three Kings", after the legend described by [[William of Malmesbury]].<ref name=EmeryP204MackenzieP310/>{{#tag:ref|The link between Dacre Castle and the "three kings" comes from [[William of Malmesbury]]'s 12th-century account of [[Constantine III of Scotland]], [[Owen I of Strathclyde]] and King [[<U+00C6>thelstan]] of England meeting at Dacre in the year 927.<ref>{{harvnb|Mackenzie|1896|p=308}}</ref>|group="nb"}} In the 14th century, these large chambers would have been subdivided into smaller rooms.<ref name=Emery1996P205/> The renovations in the 1960s uncovered a possible [[priest hole]] behind the fireplace in the Room of the Three Kings, {{convert|7|ft}} by {{convert|4|ft}}; this chamber was re-sealed to avoid the cost of restoring it.<ref>{{harvnb|Kinsman|1971|p=18}}</ref>
