The '''1761 Milestone''' is a [[milestone]] on 640 South Main Street in [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]]. The stone originally marked the junction of a [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial]] highway from Great Road and an east-west route from [[Boston, Massachusetts]] to the state of [[Connecticut]]. The stone was rediscovered during the installation of an electrical road (likely a [[tram]]). In 1898, the stone was reportedly restored to its original location by the local chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]]. The stone is embedded in a low retaining wall at the corner of South Main Street and Smithfield Road. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 24, 1982 and is historically significant as Colonial-era highway marker.

== History ==
The 1761 Milestone is a historic marker that marked the junction of a Colonial highway. In 1761, it was located at the intersection of Great Road, from [[Providence, Rhode Island]] to [[Mendon, Massachusetts]], and an east-west route from [[Boston, Massachusetts]] into [[Connecticut]]. Currently, the marker rests near the intersection of South Main Street and Smithfield Road (previously Great Road) and occupies the land designated by the Woonsocket Assessor as plat 4-C, lot 69.<ref name=nom /><ref name="Capace">{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Rhode Island |first1=Nancy |last1=Capace |location=St. Clair Shores, Michigan |page=368 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qHPYeCvnASoC&pg=PA368&dq=1761+Milestone&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0ed_U_j3H8XJPITugPAK&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=1761%20Milestone&f=false |isbn=9780403096107

The {{convert|2|ft|m}} by {{convert|3|ft|m}} marker is described by the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nomination form as an "odd-shaped piece of grey slate, somewhat broken and effaced..."<ref name=nom /> It bears a boldly cut inscription of an unknown stonecutter; the inscription is likened to 18th-century handwriting and lacks a calligraphic pattern.<ref name=nom /> The marker reads "Miles to [B]oston 1761", but according to ''Rhode Island: A Guide to the Smallest State'' it read, "Miles to Boston 47".<ref name=nom /><ref name="book2">{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bKHQOOx1eGEC&pg=PA3&dq=rhode&ei=6Mb4SLTlB5W6M8_1lPYK#v=onepage&q=rhode&f=false | title=Rhode Island: A Guide to the Smallest State | publisher=US History Publishers | author=Federal Writers' Project |year=1937 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | pages=380}}</ref>

In 1898, it was reported that the stone was unearthed during the installation of electrical road (likely for a tram) and restored to its original location by the Woonsocket chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]].<ref name="book1">{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2CraV3m4UN0C&pg=437#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The American Monthly Magazine, Volume 12 | publisher=R.R.

== Importance ==
The National Register of Historic Places nomination states the marker is at its original site and is historically important because "[t]his milestone is the only extant Woonsocket property which well recalls this era in the early history of American overland transportation, and it is one of but a handful of such stones surviving in Rhode Island that marks inter-colonial highways."<ref name=nom>{{cite web|url=http://www.preservation.ri.gov/pdfs_zips_downloads/national_pdfs/woonsocket/woon_woonsocket-multiple-resource-nomination.pdf|title=National Register MRA for Woonsocket, Rhode Island|publisher=State of Rhode Island|accessdate=2013-11-19}}</ref> It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 24, 1982.<ref name=nris />
