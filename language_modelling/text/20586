'''Marco Polo''' ({{IPA-en|<U+02C8>m<U+0251>rko<U+028A> <U+02C8>po<U+028A>lo<U+028A>|-|en-us-marco polo.ogg}}; {{IPA-it|<U+02C8>marko <U+02C8>p<U+0254><U+02D0>lo}}) (''c''. 1254 &ndash; January 8, 1324) was a [[merchant]] from the [[Venetian Republic]] who wrote ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Il Milione]]'', which introduced Europeans to Central Asia and China. He learned about trading whilst his father and uncle, [[Niccol<U+00F2> and Maffeo Polo|Niccol<U+00F2> and Maffeo]], voyaged through Asia and met [[Kublai Khan]]. In 1269, they returned to Venice to meet Marco for the first time. The three of them embarked on an epic journey to Asia, returning after 24 years to find Venice at war with [[Genoa]]; Marco was imprisoned, and dictated his stories to a cellmate. He was released in 1299, became a wealthy [[merchant]], married and had 3 children. He died in 1324, and was buried in [[San Lorenzo, Venice|San Lorenzo]].

''Il Milione'' was translated, embellished, copied by hand and adapted; there is no authoritative version. It documents his father's journey to meet the Kublai Khan, who asked them to become ambassadors, and communicate with the [[pope]]. This led to Marco's quest, through Acre, into China and to the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol court]]. Marco wrote of his extensive travels throughout Asia on behalf of the Khan, and their eventual return after {{mi to km|15000}} and 24 years of adventures.

Their pioneering journey inspired Columbus and others. Marco Polo's other legacies include [[Venice Marco Polo Airport]], the [[Marco Polo sheep]], and several books and films. He also had an influence on European cartography, leading to the introduction of the [[Fra Mauro map]].

{{See also|Niccol<U+00F2> and Maffeo Polo}}
The exact time and place of Marco Polo's birth are unknown, and current theories are mostly conjectural. However, the most quoted specific date is somewhere "around 1254",<ref group="Note">Many sources state this date; {{Harvnb|Britannica|2002|p=571}} states, "born in or around 1254. (This date, like nearly all the others concerning major events in his life, is conjectural.)"</ref> and it is generally accepted that Marco Polo was born in the [[Venetian Republic]]. While the exact birthplace is unknown, most biographers point towards [[Venice]] itself as Marco Polo's home town.<ref group="Note">Some sources (e.g. {{Harvnb|Burgan|2002|p=7}}) suggest that Polo was born in [[Kor<U+010D>ula]], an island in [[Dalmatia]], now [[Croatia]]. The [http://www.korculainfo.com/marco_polo_korcula.htm Korcula info] website states, "Polo is reputed to have been born in Korcula itself, although evidence to support this thesis is at best sketchy." A "Birthpace of Marco Polo" exists on the island ([http://www.korcula.net/mpolo/ website]).</ref><ref name="Bergreen25">{{Harvnb|Bergreen|2007|p=25}}</ref> His father Niccol<U+00F2> was a merchant who traded with the [[Middle East]], becoming wealthy and achieving great prestige.<ref name="Brittanica571"/><ref name="WB">{{Harvnb|Parker|2004|pp=648<U+2013>649}}</ref> Niccol<U+00F2> and his brother Maffeo set off on a trading voyage, before Marco was born.<ref name="WB"/> In 1260, Niccol<U+00F2> and Maffeo were residing in [[Constantinople]] when they foresaw a political change; they liquidated their assets into jewels and moved away.<ref name="Brittanica571">{{Harvnb|Brittanica|2002|p=571}}</ref> According to ''The Travels of Marco Polo'', they passed through much of Asia, and met with the [[Kublai Khan]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Yule|Cordier|1923|loc=ch.1<U+2013>9}}</ref> Meanwhile, Marco Polo's mother died, and he was raised by an aunt and uncle.<ref name="WB"/> Polo was well educated, and learned merchant subjects including foreign currency, appraising, and the handling of cargo ships,<ref name="WB"/> although he learned little or no [[Latin]].<ref name="Brittanica571"/>

[[Image:Marco Polo. Map of explore.jpg|thumb|Map of the journey]]
In 1269, Niccol<U+00F2> and Maffeo returned to Venice, meeting Marco for the first time. In 1271, Marco Polo (at seventeen years of age), his father, and his uncle set off for Asia on the series of adventures that were later documented in Marco's book. They returned to Venice in 1295, 24 years later, with many riches and treasures. They had travelled almost {{convert|15000|mi|km|0}}.<ref name="WB"/>

Upon their return, Venice was at war with [[Genoa]], and Marco Polo was taken prisoner. He spent the few months of his imprisonment dictating a detailed account of his travels to fellow inmate, [[Rustichello da Pisa]],<ref name="WB"/> who incorporated tales of his own as well as other collected anecdotes and current affairs from China. The book became known as ''The Travels of Marco Polo'', and depicts the Polos' journeys throughout Asia, giving Europeans their first comprehensive look into the inner workings of the [[Far East]], including China, India, and Japan.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bram|1983}}</ref> Marco Polo was finally released from captivity in August 1299,<ref name="WB"/> and returned home to Venice, where his father and uncle had purchased a large house in the central quarter named ''contrada San Giovanni Crisostomo''. The company continued its activities and Marco soon became a wealthy merchant. Polo financed other expeditions, but never left Venice again. In 1300, he married Donata Badoer, the daughter of Vitale Badoer, a merchant.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bergreen|2007|p=532}}</ref> They had three daughters, called Fantina, Bellela and Moreta.<ref>{{Harvnb|Power|2007|p=87}}</ref>

===Death===
[[File:Venezia - Chiesa di S.Lorenzo.JPG|thumb|The ''San Lorenzo di Venezia'' church building in the [[sestiere]] of [[Castle|Castello]] of [[Venice]], where Polo is buried. The photo was taken after the church was rebuilt.]]
In 1323, Polo was confined to bed, due to illness. On January 8, 1324, despite physicians' efforts to treat him, Polo was on his deathbed. To write and certify the will, his family requested Giovanni Giustiniani, a priest of San Procolo. His wife, Donata, and his three daughters were appointed by him as [[Executor|co-executrices]]. The church was entitled by law to a portion of his estate; he approved of this and ordered that a further sum be paid to the convent of [[San Lorenzo, Venice|San Lorenzo]], the place where he wished to be buried.<ref name="DeathBergeen">{{Harvnb|Bergreen|2007|pp=339-342}}</ref> He also set free a "[[Tatars|Tartar]] [[slave]]" who may have accompanied him from Asia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Britannica|2002|p=573}}</ref>

He divided up the rest of his assets, including several properties, between individuals, religious institutions, and every guild and fraternity to which he belonged. He also wrote-off multiple debts including 300&nbsp;lire that his sister-in-law owed him, and others for the convent of San Giovanni, San Paolo of the Order of Preachers, and a cleric named [[Friar]] Benvenuto. He ordered 220&nbsp;[[Solidus (coin)|soldi]] be paid to Giovanni Giustiniani for his work as a notary and his prayers.<ref name="DeathBergeen"/> The will, which was not signed by Polo, but was validated by then relevant "signum manus" rule, by which the testator only had to touch the document to make it abide to the rule of law,<ref>Biblioteca Marciana, the institute that holds Polo's original copy of his testament. http://marciana.venezia.sbn.it/admin/filemanager/file/UserFiles/File/testamento-polo.txt</ref> was dated January 9, 1324. Due to the Venetian law stating that the day ends at sunset, the exact date of Marco Polo's death cannot be determined, but it was between the sunsets of January 8 and 9, 1324.<ref name="DeathBergeen"/>
<!-- info by the Biblioteca Marciana gives the date of death at some time in June of 1324 -->

==The Travels of Marco Polo==
{{See|The Travels of Marco Polo}}
[[Image:Marco Polo traveling.JPG|thumb|A [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] from ''Il Milione''.]]
An authoritative version of Marco Polo's book does not exist, and the early manuscripts differ significantly. The published versions of his book either rely on single scripts, blend multiple versions together or add notes to clarify, for example in the English translation by [[Henry Yule]]. Another English translation by A.C. Moule and [[Paul Pelliot]], published in 1938, is based on the Latin manuscript which was found in the library of the [[Cathedral of Toledo]] in 1932, and is 50% longer than other versions.<ref name="book">{{Harvnb|Bergreen|2007|pp=367-368}}</ref> Approximately 150 variants in various languages are known to exist, and without the availability of a [[printing press]] many errors were made during copying and translation, resulting in many discrepancies.<ref name="NAG p.1">{{Harvnb|Edwards|p=1}}</ref>

===Stories===
[[File:Marco Polo, Il Milione, Chapter CXXIII and CXXIV Cropped.jpg|thumb|A page from ''Il Milione'', originally published during Polo's lifetime.]]
The book starts with a preface about his father and uncle traveling to [[Bolghar]] where Prince [[Berke|Berke Khan]] lived. A year later, they went to [[Ukek]] <ref name="YuleCH2">{{Harvnb|Yule|Cordier|1923|loc=ch. 2}}</ref> and continued to [[Bukhara]]. There, an envoy from [[Levant]] invited them to meet [[Kublai Khan]], who had never met Europeans.<ref>{{Harvnb|Yule|Cordier|1923|loc=ch. 3}}</ref> In 1266, they reached the seat of the Kublai Khan at [[Khanbaliq|Dadu]], present day Beijing, China. Khan received the brothers with hospitality and asked them many questions regarding the European legal and political system.<ref>{{Harvnb|Yule|Cordier|1923|loc=ch. 5}}</ref> He also inquired about the [[Pope]] and Church in [[Rome]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Yule|Cordier|1923|loc=ch. 6}}</ref> After the brothers answered the questions he tasked them with delivering a letter to the Pope, requesting 100 Christians acquainted with the [[Liberal arts|Seven Arts]] (grammar, rhetoric, logic, geometry, arithmetic, music and astronomy). Kublai Khan requested that an envoy bring him back [[Chrism|oil of the lamp in Jerusalem]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Yule|Cordier|1923|loc=ch. 7}}</ref> The long ''[[sede vacante]]'' between the death of [[Pope Clement IV]] in 1268 and the election of his successor delayed the Polos in fulfilling Khan's request. They followed the suggestion of Theobald Visconti, then papal legate for the realm of [[Egypt]], and returned to Venice in 1269 or 1270 to await the nomination of the new Pope, which allowed Marco to see his father for the first time, at the age of fifteen or sixteen.<ref name="YuleCH9">{{Harvnb|Yule|Cordier|1923|loc=ch. 9}}</ref>
[[File:Marco Polo - costume tartare.jpg|thumb||left|Polo in costume.]]
In 1271, Niccol<U+00F2>, Maffeo and Marco Polo embarked on their voyage to fulfill Khan's request. They sailed to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], and then rode on camels to the Persian port of [[Hormozg<U+0101>n Province|Hormuz]]. They wanted to sail to China, but the ships there were not seaworthy, so they continued overland until reaching Khan's summer palace in [[Xanadu|Shangdu]], near present-day [[Zhangjiakou]]. Three and one-half years after leaving Venice, when Marco was about 21 years old, Khan welcomed the Polos into his palace.<ref name="WB"/> The exact date of their arrival is unknown, but scholars estimate it to be between 1271 and 1275.<ref group="Note">[[Drog<U+00F6>n Ch<U+00F6>gyal Phagpa]], a [[Tibet]]an monk and confidant of Kublai Khan, mentions in his diaries that in 1271 a foreign friend of Kublai Khan visits&nbsp;<U+2014> quite possibly one of the elder Polos or even Marco Polo himself, although, no name was given. If this is not the case, a more likely date for their arrival is 1275 (or 1274, according to the research of Japanese scholar Matsuo Otagi).({{Harvnb|Britannica|2002|p=571}})</ref> On reaching the Mongol court, the Polos presented the sacred oil from Jerusalem and the papal letters to their patron.<ref name="Brittanica571"/>

Marco knew four languages, and the family had accumulated a great deal of knowledge and experience that was useful to Khan. It is possible that he became a government official;<ref name="WB"/> he wrote about many imperial visits to China's southern and eastern provinces, the far south and [[Burma]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://web.soas.ac.uk/burma/pdf/Polo.pdf|title=The Travels pf Marco Polo, The Venetian (1298)|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-07-14|author=W. Marsden|editor=Thomas Wright|date=2004}}</ref>

Kublai Khan declined the Polos' requests to leave China. They became worried about returning home safely, believing that if Khan died, his enemies might turn against them because of their close involvement with the ruler. In 1292, Khan's great-nephew, then ruler of [[Iran|Persia]], sent representatives to China in search of a potential wife, and they asked the Polos to accompany them, so they were permitted to return to Persia with the wedding party<U+2014>which left that same year from [[Quanzhou|Zaitun]] in southern China on a fleet of 14 [[Junk (ship)|junks]]. The party sailed to the port of [[Singapore]], travelled north to [[Sumatra]] and around the southern tip of [[India]], eventually crossing the [[Arabian Sea]] to [[Ormus|Hormuz]]. From here, the Polos left the wedding party and travelled overland to the port of Trebizond on the [[Black Sea]], the present day [[Trabzon]].<ref name="WB"/>

===Further exploration===

{{See also|Age of Discovery}}
Other less well-known European explorers had already travelled to China, such as [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], but Polo's book meant that their journey was the first to be widely known. [[Christopher Columbus]] was inspired enough by Polo's description of the [[Far East]] to visit those lands for himself; a copy of the book was among his belongings, with handwritten annotations.<ref>{{Harvnb|Landstr<U+00F6>m|1967|p=27}}</ref> [[Bento de G<U+00F3>is]], inspired by Polo's writings of a Christian kingdom in the east, travelled {{mi to km|4000}} in three years across Central Asia. He never found the kingdom, but ended his travels at the [[Great Wall of China]] in 1605, proving that Cathay was what [[Matteo Ricci]] called "China".<ref>{{Harvnb|Winchester|2008|p=264}}</ref>

===Commemoration===
The [[Marco Polo sheep]], a subspecies of ''[[Domestic sheep|Ovis aries]]'', is named after the explorer,<ref>{{Harvnb|Bergreen|2007|p=74}}</ref> who described it during his crossing of [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] (ancient [[Mount Imeon]]) in 1271.<ref group="Note">{{Harvnb|Yule|Cordier|1923|loc=ch.18}} states, "Then there are sheep here as big as asses; and their tails are so large and fat, that one tail shall weigh some 30&nbsp;lb. They are fine fat beasts, and afford capital mutton."</ref> In 1851, a three-masted [[Clipper]] built in Saint John, New Brunswick also took his name; [[Marco Polo (ship)|''the Marco Polo'']] was the first ship to sail around the world in under six months.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lubbock|2008|p=86}}</ref> The airport in [[Venice]] is named [[Venice Marco Polo Airport]],<ref>{{citation|last = Brennan|first=D.|title = Lost in Venice |publisher = WalesOnline |date = 2009-02-01 |year = 2009 |month = February |url = http://www.walesonline.co.uk/travel/travel-news/2009/02/01/lost-in-venice-91466-22826493/|accessdate = 2009-07-15}}</ref> and the [[Frequent-flyer program|frequent flyer program]] of Hong Kong [[flag carrier]] [[Cathay Pacific]] is known as the "Marco Polo Club".<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.cathayforbusiness.com/freqfly/marcopoloclub.asp|title=The Marco Polo Club|publisher=[[Cathay Pacific|Cathay Pacific Airways Limited]]|data=2009|author=Cathay Pacific Airways|accessdate=2009-07-13}}</ref> The Travels of Marco Polo are fictionalised in [[Brian Oswald Donn-Byrne]]'s ''Messer Marco Polo'' and [[Gary Jennings]]' 1984 novel ''[[The Journeyer]]''.

===Cartography===
[[Image:FraMauroDetailedMapInverted.jpg|thumb|The [[Fra Mauro map]], published ''c.''&nbsp;1450 by the Venetian monk [[Fra Mauro]].]]
Marco Polo's travels may have had some influence on the development of European cartography, ultimately leading to the [[Age of Discovery|European voyages of exploration]] a century later.<ref name="Falchetta">{{Harvnb|Falchetta|2006|p=592}}</ref> The 1453 [[Fra Mauro map]] was said by [[Giovanni Battista Ramusio]] to have been an improved copy of the one brought from [[Cathay]] by Marco Polo:
{{Quote|That fine illuminated world map on [[parchment]], which can still be seen in a large cabinet alongside the choir of their monastery (the Camaldolese monastery of San Michele di Murano) was by one of the brothers of the monastery, who took great delight in the study of [[cosmography]], diligently drawn and copied from a most beautiful and very old [[Nautical chart|nautical map]] and a world map that had been brought from [[Cathay]] by the most honourable Messer Marco Polo and his father.|[[Giovanni Battista Ramusio]]<ref name="Falchetta"/>}}
