'''Howard Harris''' (born February 9, 1958) is a former All-American wrestler at [[Oregon State Beavers wrestling|Oregon State University]] who won the 1980 NCAA wrestling heavyweight championship and was named the outstanding wrestler of the tournament.

==High School==
Harris attended [[McNary High School]] in Keizer, OR, winning the state team championship as a junior in 1975. In 1976, his senior year, McNary placed second in state but Harris won an individual state championship at 191&nbsp;lbs.<ref name = "osaa wrestling champs">{{cite web|title = OSAA Wresting Individual Championships through 2006|url = http://www.osaa.org/wrestling/records/championsthrough2006.pdf}}</ref> He completed his high school wrestling career with a mark of 80-5. In addition to his wrestling talents he was an Oregon All-State football player, racking up a total of 1448 rushing yards and 17 touchdowns.<ref name = "McNary HOF" />

==College==
Harris is one of the greatest wrestlers in the history of Oregon State University. He was a four-time All-American at 190&nbsp;lbs and heavyweight, and holds the school record for career wins (169) and single season pins (40, 1980). He won the NCAA Heavyweight championship in 1980 with a perfect record of 46-0 and is one of only five wrestlers to pin every opponent in the NCAA tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.wrestlingusa.com/02%20wusa%20web%20root/allmajorpages/bestofalltimes/bestcollegewretler.html|title = Wrestling USA Magazine, Best of All Times}}</ref> His dominance at the NCAA tournament garnered him the Outstanding Wrestler Award, the first [[African-American]] to win the award.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.osubeavers.com/ot/varsity-o-hall-of-fame.html|title = Oregon State University Sports Hall of Fame}}</ref>

Many major college wrestling programs wanted to sign Harris after his dominant senior year of high school. The day before letters of intent could be signed he announced he would wrestle for [[Oklahoma Sooners#Wrestling|Oklahoma]]. His high school coach, National Wrestling Hall of Fame inductee Jerry Lane, contacted Oregon State wrestling coach [[Dale O. Thomas|Dale Thomas]], a two-time national coach of the year and National Wrestling Hall of Fame member himself. Thomas met with Harris that day and convinced Harris that staying in the state would give him an opportunity at a national championship and set him up for success once his college days were over.<ref>Jeff Welsch and George P. Edmonston Jr. ''Tales from Oregon State Sports''. Sports Publishing LLC, 2003. p. 173-4.</ref>

==Olympics==
Harris was a member of the 1980 United States Olympic Team. However, the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|United States boycott]] of the [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympics]] in Moscow meant Harris couldn't compete. He did compete in the 1981 World Cup of Wrestling where he faced Olympic Champion Sanasar Ognesyan.
