'''Michael Joseph Jackson''' (August 29, 1958&nbsp;<U+2013> June 25, 2009) was an [[United States|America]]n [[recording artist]], [[entertainer]] and [[businessman]]. The seventh child of the [[Jackson family]], he made his debut on the professional music scene in 1968 at the age of 11 as a member of [[The Jackson 5]]. He then began a solo career in 1971 while still a member of the group. Referred to as the "[[List of honorific titles in popular music|King of Pop]]" in subsequent years,<ref name="edeath">{{cite web |last=Ryan|first=Joal| title= Michael Jackson, Pop's Thrilling King, Dead at 50|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b131173_michael_jackson_pops_thrilling_king.html |date=2009-06-25|publisher=E!

In the early 1980s, he became a dominant figure in [[popular music]] and the first [[African American]] entertainer to amass a strong [[crossover (music)|crossover]] following on [[MTV]]. The popularity of his [[music video]]s airing on MTV, such as "[[Beat It]]", "[[Billie Jean]]" and "[[Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]"<U+2014>widely credited with transforming the music video from a promotional tool into an art form<U+2014>helped bring the relatively new channel to fame. Videos such as "[[Black or White]]" and "[[Scream/Childhood|Scream]]" made Jackson an enduring staple on MTV in the 1990s. With stage performances and music videos, Jackson popularized a number of physically complicated dance techniques, such as the [[robot (dance)|robot]] and the [[moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]]. His distinctive musical sound and vocal style influenced many [[hip hop]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[contemporary R&B]] artists across several generations.

Jackson donated and raised millions of dollars for beneficial causes through his [[Heal the World Foundation|foundation]]s, charity [[singles (music)|singles]], and support of 39 charities. Other aspects of his personal life, including his often [[Michael Jackson's health and appearance|changing appearances]] and eccentric behavior, generated significant controversy which damaged his public image. Though he was accused of [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|child sexual abuse in 1993]], the criminal investigation was closed due to lack of evidence and Jackson was not charged. The singer had experienced health concerns since the early 1990s and conflicting reports regarding the state of his finances since the late 1990s. Jackson married twice and fathered three children, actions which caused further controversy. In 2005, Jackson was [[People v. Jackson|tried and acquitted]] of further sexual abuse allegations and several other charges.

One of the few artists to have been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] twice, his other achievements include multiple ''[[Guinness World Records]]''<U+2014>including one for "Most Successful Entertainer of All Time"<U+2014>13 [[Grammy Award]]s, 13 [[List of artists who reached number one in the United States#J|number one singles]] in his solo career, and the sale of 750 million records worldwide.<ref name="worldwidesales">{{cite web |title=Michael Jackson's Groundbreaking Career, By The Numbers |last=Ditzian |first=Eric |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1614815/20090626/jackson_michael.jhtml|publisher= [[MTV]]|date= 2009-06-27|accessdate=2009-06-27}}</ref> At the time of his death, he was preparing for ''[[This Is It (Michael Jackson concerts)|This Is It]]'', a series of 50 concerts that would have been held in [[London]] beginning July 13, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/05/20/michael.jackson.tour/|title=Michael Jackson delays some shows until '10|first=Alan|last=Duke|publisher=CNN|date=May 20, 2009|accessdate=June 26, 2009}}</ref>

==Life and career ==
===1958&ndash;75: Early life and The Jackson 5===
Michael Joseph Jackson was born August 29, 1958 in [[Gary, Indiana]] (an industrial suburb of [[Chicago]]) to a working-class family.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 20">George, p. 20</ref> The son of [[African-American]] parents [[Joseph Jackson|Joseph Walter "Joe" Jackson]] and [[Katherine Jackson|Katherine Esther]] ([[Married and maiden names|n<U+00E9>e]] Scruse),<ref name = "Nelson George overview 20"/> he was the seventh of nine children. His siblings are [[Rebbie Jackson|Rebbie]], [[Jackie Jackson|Jackie]], [[Tito Jackson|Tito]], [[Jermaine Jackson|Jermaine]], [[La Toya Jackson|La Toya]], [[Marlon Jackson|Marlon]], [[Randy Jackson (musician)|Randy]] and [[Janet Jackson|Janet]].<ref name = "Nelson George overview 20"/> Joseph Jackson was a steel mill employee who often performed in an R&B band called The Falcons with his brother Luther. Jackson was raised as a [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]] by his devout mother.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 20"/>

Jackson claimed that he was physically and emotionally abused by his father from a young age, enduring incessant rehearsals, whippings and name-calling. But he also credited his father's strict discipline as playing a large part in his success. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://crime.about.com/od/current/p/michael_jackson.htm | title = Michael Jackson - The King of Pop or Wacko Jacko? | publisher = crime.about.com | accessdate = 2009-06-27}}</ref><ref name="MJ's secret childhood">{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/vh1_news_presents/82010/episode_about.jhtml |title=Michael Jackson's Secret Childhood |publisher=[[VH1]] |accessdate=June 20, 2008}}</ref> In one altercation<U+2014>later recalled by Marlon Jackson<U+2014>Joseph held Michael upside down by one leg and "pummeled him over and over again with his hand, hitting him on his back and buttocks".<ref name = "tara 20-22">Taraborrelli, pp. 20<U+2013>22</ref> Joseph would also trip or push his male children into walls. One night while Jackson was asleep, Joseph climbed into his room through the bedroom window. Wearing a fright mask, he entered the room screaming and shouting. Joseph said he wanted to teach his children not to leave the window open when they went to sleep. For years afterwards, Michael said he suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom.<ref name = "tara 20-22"/>

Jackson first spoke openly about his childhood abuse in a 1993 interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]]. He said that during his childhood he often cried from loneliness and would sometimes start to vomit upon seeing his father.<ref name = "campbell (1995) 14-16">Campbell (1995), pp. 14<U+2013>16</ref><ref name = "lewis 165-168">Lewis, pp. 165<U+2013>168</ref><ref>George, pp. 45<U+2013>46</ref><ref>Taraborrelli, p. 620</ref> In Jackson's other high profile interview, ''[[Living with Michael Jackson]]'' (2003), the singer covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse.<ref name = "tara 20-22"/> Jackson recalled that Joseph sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed and that "if you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you".<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 602</ref>

Jackson showed musical talent early in his life, performing in front of classmates and others during a Christmas recital at the age of five.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 20"/> In 1964, Jackson and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers<U+2014>a band formed by brothers Jackie, Tito and Jermaine<U+2014>as backup musicians playing [[congas]] and [[tambourine]], respectively. Jackson later began performing backup vocals and dancing; at the age of eight, he and Jermaine assumed lead vocals, and the group's name was changed to [[The Jackson 5]].<ref name = "Nelson George overview 20"/> The band toured [[Midwestern United States|the Midwest]] extensively from 1966 to 1968. The band frequently performed at a string of black clubs and venues collectively known as the "[[chitlin' circuit]]", where they often opened for [[striptease]]s and other adult acts. In 1966, they won a major local talent show with renditions of [[Motown sound|Motown]] hits and [[James Brown]]'s "[[I Got You (I Feel Good)]]", led by Michael.<ref name=RRHF>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/the-jackson-five |title=The Jackson Five |accessdate=May 29, 2007 |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]}}</ref>

The Jackson 5 recorded several songs, including "[[Big Boy (The Jackson 5 song)|Big Boy]]", for the local record label [[Steeltown Records|Steeltown]] in 1967 and signed with [[Motown Records]] in 1968.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 20"/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine later described the young Michael as "a prodigy" with "overwhelming musical gifts", noting that Michael "quickly emerged as the main draw and lead singer" after he began to dance and sing with his brothers.<ref name="rollingstone"/> Though Michael sang with a "child's piping voice, he danced like a grown-up hoofer and sang with the R&B/gospel inflections of [[Sam Cooke]], James Brown, [[Ray Charles]] and [[Stevie Wonder]]".<ref name="rollingstone">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/michaeljackson/biography|title=Michael Jackson: Biography|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=February 14, 2008}}</ref> The group set a chart record when its first four singles ("[[I Want You Back]]", "[[ABC (song)|ABC]]", "[[The Love You Save]]" and "[[I'll Be There]]") peaked at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name = "Nelson George overview 20"/> During The Jackson&nbsp;5's early years, Motown's public relations team claimed that Jackson was nine years old<U+2014>two years younger than he actually was<U+2014>to make him appear cuter and more accessible to the mainstream audience.<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 17</ref> Starting in 1972, Jackson released a total of four solo studio albums with Motown, among them ''[[Got to Be There]]'' and ''[[Ben (album)|Ben]]''. These were released as part of the Jackson&nbsp;5 franchise, and produced successful singles such as "[[Got to Be There (song)|Got to Be There]]", "[[Ben (song)|Ben]]" and a remake of [[Bobby Day]]'s "[[Rockin' Robin (song)|Rockin' Robin]]". The group's sales began declining in 1973, and the band members chafed under Motown's strict refusal to allow them creative control or input.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 22">George, p. 22</ref> Although the group scored several top&nbsp;40 hits, including the top&nbsp;5 [[disco]] single "[[Dancing Machine]]" and the top&nbsp;20 hit "[[I Am Love]]", the Jackson&nbsp;5 left Motown in 1975.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 22"/>

===1975&ndash;81: Move to Epic and ''Off the Wall''===
The Jackson 5 signed a new contract with [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] in June 1975, joining the Philadelphia International Records division, later [[Epic Records]].<ref name = "Nelson George overview 22"/> As a result of legal proceedings, the group was renamed The Jacksons.<ref name = "tara 138<U+2013>144">Taraborrelli, pp. 138<U+2013>144</ref> After the name change, the band continued to tour internationally, releasing six more albums between 1976 and 1984. From 1976 to 1984, Michael Jackson was the lead songwriter of the group, writing hits such as "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]", "[[This Place Hotel]]" and "[[Can You Feel It]]".<ref name="RRHF" />

In 1978, Jackson starred as [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]] in the [[musical]] ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]''.<ref>Taraborrelli, pp. 163<U+2013>169</ref> The musical scores were arranged by [[Quincy Jones]], who formed a partnership with Jackson during the film's production and agreed to produce the singer's next solo album, ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]''.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 23">George, p. 23</ref> In 1979, Jackson broke his nose during a complex dance routine. His subsequent [[rhinoplasty]] surgery was not a complete success; he complained of breathing difficulties that would affect his career. He was referred to [[Steven Hoefflin|Dr. Steven Hoefflin]], who performed Jackson's second rhinoplasty and other subsequent operations.<ref name = "tara 205<U+2013>210">Taraborrelli, pp. 205<U+2013>210</ref>

Jones and Jackson jointly produced ''Off the Wall''. Songwriters included Jackson, [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave's]] [[Rod Temperton]], [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. Released in 1979, it was the first album to generate four US top&nbsp;10 hits, including the chart-topping singles "[[Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough]]" and "[[Rock with You (Michael Jackson song)|Rock with You]]".<ref name = "Nelson George overview 37-38"/> ''Off the Wall'' reached number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and has since been certified for 7&nbsp;million shipments in the US and eventually sold over 20 million copies worldwide.<ref name="Off the Wall 20 million">{{cite web |url=http://www.virginmedia.com/music/classicalbums/michaeljackson-offthewall.php |title=Michael Jackson: Off the Wall&nbsp;<U+2014> Classic albums&nbsp;<U+2014> Music&nbsp;<U+2014> Virgin media |publisher=[[Virgin Media]] |accessdate=December 12, 2008}}</ref><ref name="RIAA certifications">{{cite web |url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Michael%20Jackson&format=ALBUM&go=Search&perPage=100

===1982&ndash;85: ''Thriller'', ''Motown 25'', ''We Are the World'' and business career===

In what would turn out to be the apex of his career, the album remained in the top&nbsp;10 of the ''Billboard'' 200 for 80&nbsp;consecutive weeks, 37 at the peak.

The period of ''Thriller'' was an extraordinarily lucrative one for Jackson, whose lawyer [[John Branca]] had negotiated what he boasted then as the highest royalty rate ever in the music industry, approximately $2 per album. Meanwhile, Jackson raked in profits from ''The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller'', a documentary by Jackson and [[John Landis]] which quickly sold over 350,000 copies. In addition, he began profiting from his image in earnest, as Michael Jackson dolls and other novelties hit the market.<ref name=TIME/>

[[File:MichaelJacksonMoonwalk.ogg|thumb|Jackson moonwalks during his performance on ''Motown 25'']]
Beyond its record-breaking success among fans, ''Thriller'' instituted multiple changes within the music industry. First, it raised the importance of albums, while challenging notions about how many prospective hits an album should contain.<ref name=vh1>{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/jackson_michael/bio.jhtml |title=Michael Jackson |publisher=VH1 |year= (2007) |accessdate=February 22, 2007}}</ref> Second, it restored to the industry a sense of confidence in its ability to release high-level artistry during a time when profits had been sinking due to what one industry analyst called "the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop".<ref name=TIME>{{cite news | first= Jay | last= Cocks |authorlink=Jay Cocks | title= Why He's a Thriller | date= March 19, 1984| publisher= ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950053-1,00.html | accessdate= March 17, 2007}}</ref> Third, it helped bring MTV into its heyday, even as MTV helped fuel ''Thriller's'' success.

Jackson suffered a setback on January 27, 1984. While filming a [[Pepsi Cola]] commercial at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles, he suffered [[second degree burn]]s to his scalp after pyrotechnics accidentally set his hair on fire. Happening in front of a full house of fans during a simulated concert, the incident was the subject of heavy media scrutiny and elicited an outpouring of sympathy.<ref name = "tara 279<U+2013>287">Taraborrelli, pp. 279<U+2013>287</ref> PepsiCo settled a lawsuit out of court, and Jackson gave his $1.5&nbsp;million settlement to the [[Brotman Medical Center]] in [[Culver City, California]], where he had been treated, allowing the hospital to acquire the best available technology for treating severe burns; Brotman subsequently renamed its burn ward "Michael Jackson Burn Center" in his honor.<ref name = "tara 279<U+2013>287"/> Jackson had his third rhinoplasty shortly afterwards and grew self conscious about his appearance.<ref name = "tara 205<U+2013>210"/>

[[Image:Michael Jackson with the Reagans.png|thumb|Jackson at the White House South Portico with President Ronald Reagan and first lady [[Nancy Reagan]], 1984]]
On May 14, 1984, Jackson was invited to the [[White House]] to receive an award presented by [[U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]. The award was given for his support of charities that helped people overcome [[alcoholism|alcohol]] and [[drug abuse]].<ref>Taraborrelli, pp. 304<U+2013>307</ref> He won eight awards during the [[Grammy Awards of 1984|1984 Grammys]]. Unlike later albums, ''Thriller'' did not have an official tour to promote it, but the 1984 [[Victory Tour]], headlined by The Jacksons, showcased much of his new solo material to more than two million Americans.<ref>Taraborrelli, pp. 315<U+2013>319</ref> He donated his $5 million share from the Victory Tour to charity.<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 320</ref>

Jackson co-wrote the charity single "[[We Are the World]]" with [[Lionel Richie]], which was released worldwide to aid the poor in Africa and the US. He was one of 39 music celebrities who performed on the record. The single became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with nearly 20&nbsp;million copies sold and millions of dollars donated to [[famine relief]].<ref>Taraborrelli, pp. 340<U+2013>344</ref>

While working with Paul McCartney on the two hit singles "[[The Girl Is Mine]]" and "[[Say Say Say]]", the pair became friendly, occasionally visiting one another. In one discussion, McCartney told Jackson about the millions of dollars he had made from music catalogs; he was earning approximately $40&nbsp;million a year from other people's songs. Jackson then began a business career buying, selling and distributing publishing rights to music from numerous artists. Shortly afterwards, ATV Songs<U+2014>a music catalogue holding thousands of songs, including most of the songs written by [[Lennon-McCartney]] between 1963-1973<U+2014>was put up for sale.<ref name = "tara 333-337">Taraborrelli, pp. 333<U+2013>337</ref><ref name = "1995 music deal">{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E7DD1439F93BA35752C1A963958260 |title=Michael Jackson sells Beatles songs to Sony |work=The New York Times |date=November 8, 1995 |accessdate=July 23, 2008}}</ref>

Jackson took immediate interest in the catalog but was warned that he would face strong competition. Excited, he skipped around saying, "I don't care. I want those songs. Get me those songs Branca [his attorney]". Branca then contacted the attorney of McCartney, who clarified that his client was not interested in bidding; "It's too pricey". After Jackson had started negotiations, McCartney changed his mind and tried to persuade Yoko Ono to join him in a joint bid, she declined, so he pulled out. Jackson eventually beat the rest of the competition in negotiations that lasted 10 months, purchasing the catalog for $47.5 million. When McCartney found out he said, "I think it's dodgy to do things like that. To be someone's friend and then buy the rug they're standing on". <ref name = "tara 333-337"/><ref name="Guardian document finances">{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1506781,00.html |title=Bad Fortunes |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=June 15, 2005 |accessdate=July 23, 2008}}</ref>

In 1986, the [[tabloid|tabloid press]] ran a story claiming that Jackson slept in a [[Hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen chamber]] to slow the aging process; he was pictured lying down in a glass box.

Jackson bought and befriended a pet chimpanzee called [[Bubbles (chimpanzee)|Bubbles]], an act which extended his eccentric persona. In 2003, the singer claimed that Bubbles shared his toilet and cleaned his bedroom.<ref name="BBC, Jackson's image problems"/> Later, it was reported that Jackson bought the bones of [[Joseph Merrick|The Elephant Man]]. Although untrue, it was a story that Jackson again disseminated to the tabloid press.<ref name = "tara 355-361"/><ref name="BBC, Jackson's image problems"/> These stories inspired the pejorative nickname "Wacko Jacko", which Jackson acquired the following year.

Jackson's skin was a medium-brown color for the entire duration of his youth, but starting in the early 1980s, his skin gradually grew paler. This change gained widespread media coverage, including rumors that Jackson was bleaching his skin.<ref name = "campbell (1995) 14-16"/> In the mid-1980s, Jackson was diagnosed with [[vitiligo]] and [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]]; the latter was in [[remission (medicine)|remission]] in Jackson's case, and both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight.

Jackson founded the "[[Heal the World Foundation]]" in 1992.

As he landed on the canvass, he maintained a motionless "clenched fist, standing statue stance", dressed in a gold and black military outfit and sunglasses; he remained completely motionless for several minutes while the crowd cheered. He then slowly removed his sunglasses, threw them away and began to sing and dance. His routine included four songs: "[[Jam (song)|Jam]]", "Billie Jean", "Black or White" and "Heal the World".

{{main|1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson}}
Jackson gave a 90-minute interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]] in February 1993, his first television interview since 1979. He grimaced when speaking of his childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. He denied previous tabloid rumors that he bought the bones of [[the Elephant Man]] or slept in a [[hyperbaric]] oxygen chamber. The entertainer went on to dispel suggestions that he bleached his skin, stating for the first time that he had [[vitiligo]]. The interview was watched by 90&nbsp;million Americans, becoming the fourth most-viewed non-sport program in US history. It also started a public debate on the topic of vitiligo, a relatively unknown condition before then.

In early 1996, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) issued a press release charging Jackson with [[antisemitism]] regarding lyrics in the song "[[They Don't Care About Us]]", the fourth single from HIStory.<ref name="adl">ADL Outraged that Michael Jackson has reinstated anti-semitic lyrics into video version of "They Don't Care About Us", http://www.adl.org/presrele/ASUS_12/2662_12.asp</ref> The song had originally been recorded with lyrics that included the phrase "Jew me, sue me", and "Kick me, kike me". The ADL complained and Jackson responded by saying he would re-record the lyrics before the album went into production. However the ADL's press release charged that Jackson had performed the song live and included the lyrics in question during the live performance.<ref name="adl"/> The dispute over the lyrics upset long-time Jackson friend [[Steven Spielberg]], who considered the song anti-semitic.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4612963.stm|title=Obituary: Michael Jackson|publisher=BBC News|date=June 26, 2009|accessdate=June 28, 2009}}</ref>

The [[HIStory World Tour]] began on September 7, 1996, and finished on October 15, 1997. Jackson performed 82 concerts in 58 cities to over 4.5&nbsp;million fans. The show, which visited 5 continents and 35 countries, became Jackson's most successful in terms of audience figures.<ref name = "lewis 95-96">Lewis, pp. 95<U+2013>96</ref> During the Australian leg of the HIStory World Tour, Jackson married [[Dermatology|dermatologist]] nurse Deborah Jeanne Rowe, with whom he fathered a son, Michael Joseph Jackson, Jr. (also known as "Prince"), and a daughter, Paris Michael Katherine Jackson.<ref name = "tara 580<U+2013>581"/><ref>Taraborrelli, p. 597</ref> The pair first met in the mid-1980s, when Jackson was diagnosed with [[vitiligo]].

In 1997, Jackson released ''[[Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix]]'', which contained remixes of hit singles from ''HIStory'' and five new songs. Worldwide sales stand at 6 million copies as of 2007, making it the [[List of best-selling remix albums worldwide|best selling remix albums ever released]].

Throughout June 1999, Jackson was involved in a number of charitable events. He joined [[Luciano Pavarotti]] for a [[benefit concert]] in Modena, Italy. The show was in support of the [[non-profit organization]] [[War Child (charity)|Warchild]], and raised a million dollars for the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|refugees of Kosovo]], as well as additional funds for the children of Guatemala.<ref name="Charity concert Italy">{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1426933/19990505/carey_mariah.jhtml |title=Ricky Martin, Mariah Carey, Michael Jackson, Others To Join Pavarotti For Benefit

===2000&ndash;02: Label dispute, ''Invincible'' and third child===
In 2000, Jackson was listed in the book of ''Guinness World Records'' for his support of 39 charities, more than any other entertainer or personality.<ref>Lewis, pp. 8<U+2013>9</ref>
At the time, Jackson was waiting for the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him; this allowed him to promote his old material how he liked and prevented Sony from getting a cut of the profit. Jackson expected this to occur early in the new millennium, however, due to the fine print and various clauses in the contract, this revert date is still many years away. Jackson began an investigation, and it emerged that the attorney who represented the singer in the deal was also representing Sony, creating a [[conflict of interest]].<ref name = "tara 610<U+2013>611"/> Jackson was also concerned about another conflict of interest. For a number of years, Sony had been pushing to buy all of Jackson's share in their music catalog venture. If Jackson's career or financial situation were to deteriorate, he would have to sell his catalog. Thus, Sony had something to gain from Jackson's career failing.<ref name = "tara 614<U+2013>617"/> Jackson was able to use these conflicts as leverage to exit his contract early.<ref name = "tara 610<U+2013>611"/> Just before the release of ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]'', Jackson informed the head of Sony Music Entertainment, [[Tommy Mottola]], that he was leaving Sony.<ref name = "tara 610<U+2013>611"/> As a result, all singles releases, video shootings and promotions concerning the ''Invincible'' album were canceled. Jackson made allegations in July 2002 that Mottola was a "devil" and a "racist" who did not support his African-American artists, using them merely for his own personal gain.<ref name = "tara 610<U+2013>611"/> He charged that Mottola had called his colleague [[Irving Lorenzo|Irv Gotti]] a "fat [[nigger]]".<ref>{{cite interview |last=Jackson |first=Jermaine |subjectlink=Jermaine Jackson |interviewer=[[Connie Chung]]| title=Interview with Jermaine Jackson |date=(December 31, 2002) |program=''[[Connie Chung Tonight]]'' |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0212/31/cct.00.html |accessdate=July 2, 2008}}</ref> Sony disputed claims that they had failed to promote ''Invincible'' with sufficient energy, maintaining that Jackson refused to tour in the US.<ref>{{cite web|author=Burkeman, Oliver|title=Jacko gets tough: but is he a race crusader or just a falling star?|publisher=The Guardian|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/jul/08/oliverburkeman|date=July 8, 2002|accessdate=July 23, 2008}}</ref>

Six years after his last studio album and after spending much of the late 1990s out of the public eye, Jackson released ''Invincible'' in October 2001 to much anticipation. To help promote the album, a special [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special|30th Anniversary celebration]] at Madison Square Garden occurred in September 2001 to mark the singer's 30th year as a solo artist. Jackson appeared onstage alongside his brothers for the first time since 1984.<ref name="guardian">{{cite web|author=Branigan, Tania|title=Jackson spends <U+00A3>20m to be Invincible|publisher=The Guardian|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/sep/08/taniabranigan|date=September 8, 2001|accessdate=July 23, 2008}}</ref> The show also featured performances by [[M<U+00FD>a]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], [[Whitney Houston]], '[[N Sync]], and Slash, among other artists.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 50-53"/> In the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Jackson helped organize the [[United We Stand: What More Can I Give]] [[benefit concert]] at [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The concert was aired on October 21, 2001, and included performances from dozens of major artists, including Jackson, who performed his song "[[What More Can I Give]]" as the finale.<ref name = "tara 614<U+2013>617"/> ''Invincible'' was a commercial success, debuting atop the charts in 13 countries and going on to sell approximately 10&nbsp;million copies worldwide. It received double-platinum certification in the US.<ref name="RIAA certifications"/><ref name="KOP achievements"/><ref name = "tara 614<U+2013>617">Taraborrelli, pp. 614<U+2013>617</ref> However, the sales for ''Invincible'' were notably low compared to his previous releases, due in part to a diminishing pop music industry, the lack of promotion, no supporting world tour and the label dispute.<ref name = "tara 614<U+2013>617"/> The album spawned three singles, "[[You Rock My World]]", "[[Cry (Michael Jackson song)|Cry]]" and "[[Butterflies (Michael Jackson song)|Butterflies]]", the latter without a music video.

Jackson's third child, Prince Michael Jackson II (also known as Blanket) was born in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/topics/michael-jackson/ |title=Michael Jackson |publisher=Daily Mirror |accessdate=May 29, 2009}}</ref> The mother's identity was never released by Jackson, but he has said the child was the result of [[artificial insemination]] from a [[Surrogacy|surrogate mother]] and his own [[Spermatozoon|sperm cells]].<ref name="tara 599-600">Taraborrelli, pp. 599<U+2013>600</ref> In November of that year, Jackson brought his new born son onto the balcony of his hotel room in [[Berlin]], as fans stood below. Holding him in his right arm, with a cloth loosely draped over the baby's face, Jackson briefly extended the baby over the railing of the balcony, four stories above ground level, causing widespread criticism in the media. Jackson later apologized for the incident, calling it "a terrible mistake".<ref name="Balcony incident">{{cite web |first=Jennifer |last=Vineyard |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458799/20021120/jackson_michael.jhtml

===2003&ndash;07: Documentary, trial and business ventures===
In 2003, Sony put out a compilation of Jackson's [[Number Ones (Michael Jackson album)|hits]] on [[compact disc|CD]] and [[DVD]]. In the US, the album peaked at number 13 and was certified platinum by the RIAA; in the UK it was certified for shipments of at least 1.2 million units.<ref name="RIAA certifications"/><ref name="BPI">{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/index.asp |title=BPI Searchable database&nbsp;<U+2014> Gold and Platinum |publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]] |accessdate=January 25, 2009}}</ref> In a [[Granada Television]] documentary titled ''[[Living with Michael Jackson]]'', the singer was seen holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with [[Gavin Arvizo]], who would later accuse him of [[child sexual abuse]].<ref name = "tara 640">Taraborrelli, p. 640</ref> In the same documentary Jackson was observed spending large amounts of money in an apparently frivolous manner, including as much as $6 million in a single store.<ref name="usatoday finances"/> Shortly after the documentary aired, Jackson was charged with seven counts of [[child sexual abuse]] and two counts of [[Alcoholic beverage#United States of America|administering an intoxicating agent]] in order to commit that [[felony]].

Jackson denied the sexual abuse allegations, saying that the sleepovers were in no way sexual in nature. Jackson's friend [[Elizabeth Taylor]] defended him on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', saying that she had been there when they "were in the bed, watching television. There was nothing abnormal about it. There was no touchy-feely going on. We laughed like children and we watched a lot of [[Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group|Walt Disney]].

The assessment made by Katz was that Jackson had become a regressed 10-year-old and did not fit the profile of a [[pedophile]].<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 648</ref>

The ''[[People v. Jackson]]'' trial began in [[Santa Maria, California|Santa Maria]], [[California]], two years after Jackson was originally charged. During this period the singer became dependent on [[morphine]] and [[Pethidine|Demerol]], a dependency which he subsequently overcame. He also suffered from stress-related illnesses and severe weight loss, that would alter his appearance.

Sony BMG released ''[[Visionary: The Video Singles]]'' to the European market: a series of 20 of his biggest hit singles of the 1980s and 1990s. Each single was issued weekly over a five-month period in [[DualDisc]] format (DVD video on one side, CD audio on the other), and the whole group of discs was made available as a boxed set afterwards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mjvisionary.com/mjvisionary.html |title=M J Visionary|publisher=[[Sony BMG]]|accessdate=November 11, 2006}}</ref> The box set was released in the US on November 14, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sonymusicstore.com/store/catalog/MerchandiseDetails.jsp?selectionId=700406&sms=extsite-sony.com |title=Michael Jackson Visionary ...The Video Singles |publisher=Sony BMG |accessdate=November 14, 2006}}</ref>

===Vocal style===
Jackson sang from childhood, and over time his voice and vocal style changed noticeably, either through puberty or a personal preference to align his vocal interpretation to the themes and genres he chose to express. Between 1971 and 1975, Jackson's voice "descended ever so slightly from boy soprano to his current androgynous high tenor".{{failed verification}}<ref name="rollingstone"/> In the mid-1970s, the singer adopted a "vocal hiccup" as seen in "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]". The purpose of the hiccup<U+2014>somewhat like a gulping for air or gasping<U+2014>was to help promote a certain emotion, be it excitement, sadness or fear.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 22"/> With the arrival of ''Off the Wall'' in the late 1970s, Jackson's abilities as a vocalist were well regarded; Allmusic described him as a "blindingly gifted vocalist".<ref name="AMG OTW"/> At the time, ''Rolling Stone'' compared his vocals to the "breathless, dreamy stutter" of [[Stevie Wonder]]. Their analysis was also that "Jackson's feathery-timbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling [[falsetto]] that's used very daringly".<ref name="RS OTW"/> 1982 saw the release of ''Thriller'', and ''Rolling Stone'' were of the opinion that Jackson was then singing in a "fully adult voice" that was "tinged by sadness".<ref name="RS Thriller"/>
