'''''Riding Into the Sunset''''' is a [[public art|public]] [[sculpture]] by Electra Waggoner Biggs, depicting [[Will Rogers]] on his horse, Soapsuds, and is located on the [[Campus of Texas Tech University|campus]] of [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas]]. Three additional castings were commissioned.<ref>http://www.willrogers.com/memorial/art/art.html</ref> The sculpture is a contributing object to the [[Texas Technological College Historic District]]; a [[National Register of Historic Places]] listing.<ref>http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/common/view_narrative.asp?narrative=96000523.htm&title=Texas%20Technological%20College%20Historic%20District&filepath=E:\atlas_text\nr_listed\html</ref>

== Location and installation ==
A [[wiktionary:campus legend|campus legend]] holds that the statue was originally intended to be positioned with Will Rogers facing due west, so that it would appear he was riding into the sunset. However, that position would cause Soapsuds' posterior to face due east, towards downtown [[Lubbock, Texas]], potentially insulting the Lubbock business community. To address this issue, the statue was turned 23&nbsp;[[degree (angle)|degrees]] to the east, causing Soapsuds' rear to face in the direction of the [[Campus of Texas A&M University|Texas A&M campus]] in [[College Station, Texas]].<ref name=Rogers>{{cite web|title=Will Rogers & Soapsuds|publisher=Texas Tech University|url=http://www.ttu.edu/traditions/rogers.php|accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref>
