The '''Time War''' is an event referred to on several occasions in the long-running [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', beginning from its revival in 2005. The conflict was between the Time Lords and the [[Dalek]]s, resulting in their mutual destruction, which the series suggests was caused by the Doctor himself.<ref>In "[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]" (2005) the Doctor claims credit for the destruction of the Dalek fleet, and adds that the Time Lords perished along with the Daleks. In "[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]" (2005)The Doctor says that his planet "burned" like Earth of the far future, and is "rocks and dust" as a result of the war. In "[[The Satan Pit]]" (2006) the [[List of Doctor Who villains#Beast|Beast]] describes the Doctor as "the killer of his own kind."</ref> [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] also referred to this conflict as "the last great Time War," implying that there had been others.

The term "Time War" can also be applied to at least two types of time-spanning conflicts in the ''Doctor Who'' universe. The first type of time war is where the two sides are fighting the war across different points in history, separated by centuries or millennia. The second type of time war is where Time itself is used as a weapon, with pre-emptive strikes, time-loops, temporal paradoxes, and the reversal of historical events. The last great Time War appears to be of the latter variety.

It is implied in the various spinoff media that there have been several previous Time Wars, but that all traces of them have been removed from history. One such war is mentioned in the 1995 [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel ''[[Sky Pirates!]]'' by [[Dave Stone]]. Lasting thirty thousand years, it is fought between the [[Time Lord]]s and other races that are developing time travel. The Time Lords destroy one such race, the [[Charon (Doctor Who)|Charon]], before they even exist.<ref name="skypirates">{{cite book |last= Stone |first=  David | title=Sky Pirates! | pages=39 |year=1995 |publisher=Virgin Publishing Ltd |isbn=0-426-20446-8 }}</ref> This war takes place a generation after the time of [[Rassilon]], the founder of Time Lord society. 

==The last great Time War==
The last great Time War is first alluded to in the first episode of the 2005 series, "[[Rose (Doctor Who)|Rose]]". There, the [[Ninth Doctor]] explains to his [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]], [[Rose Tyler]], that the reason behind the [[Auton|Nestene Consciousness']] invasion of [[Earth]] was because its food planets were destroyed in "the war." Later in the episode, the Doctor states that he fought in the war, but he was unable to save the [[List of Doctor Who planets#P|Nestenes' planet]].

In the following episode, "[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]" (2005) set five billion years in the future, Jabe of the [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Forest of Cheem|Forest of Cheem]] expresses amazement that the Doctor, a Time Lord, still exists, implying that the war had consequences up and down history. At the end of that episode, the Doctor confesses to Rose that the war had destroyed his home planet, leaving him the only surviving Time Lord.

In "[[The Unquiet Dead]]" (2005) the Doctor encounters the ghostly [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Gelth|Gelth]], [[extraterrestrial life in popular culture|aliens]] from another dimension, whose bodies had been destroyed by the war. The Gelth say that the war was unseen by "lower species," but devastating to the "higher" ones.

In "[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]" (2005), it is revealed that the Time Lords' adversaries in the war were the [[Dalek]]s. The Doctor claims responsibility for the destruction of ten million Dalek ships, but also admits that the Time Lords "burned" with them. What actually started the war was not stated, but executive producer [[Russell T. Davies]] commented in an episode of the documentary series ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'' that the origins of the war dated back to ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'' (1975) where the Time Lords send the [[Fourth Doctor]] into the past in an attempt to avert the Daleks' creation, or affect their development to make them less aggressive. 

Further details of the War are sketchy; in "[[The Sound of Drums]]" (2007) [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] says that he was resurrected by the Time Lords because they believed he would be a "perfect warrior for a time war"; in "[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]" (2006) the [[Tenth Doctor]] mentions that he fought on the front lines, and was present at the Fall of [[List of Doctor Who planets#A|Arcadia]]. "The Sound of Drums" states that the Doctor was responsible for destroying both the Dalek fleet and his home planet [[Gallifrey]], after the [[Dalek variants#Dalek Emperor|Dalek Emperor]] gained control of something known as the Cruciform. Although at least the single Dalek in "Dalek" had survived, the Doctor dismisses the possibility that other Time Lords may have survived as well, saying that he would have sensed it if they had. However, unknown to him, the Master also survived, albeit in human form.

====Aftermath====
Despite speculation in some fan quarters, there is no real evidence that the Time Lords were erased from history due to the Time War. Indeed, races such as the Forest of Cheem and the [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Krillitane|Krillitanes]] know of the Time Lords, although they describe them as extinct. Similarly, although the Daleks are described as having "vanished out of time and space" by Jack Harkness in the two-part first season finale, they are still known as a legend by the future inhabitants of Earth. 

Why the Doctor does not encounter other time travelling Time Lords or return to Gallifrey at a time before its destruction is not made explicit in the series (but see [[#Eighth Doctor Adventures|below]] for a possible explanation from the novels). The Doctor does run into a Time Lord from a different era other than his own, specifically his own fifth incarnation, in the mini-episode [[Time Crash]].

The destruction of the Time Lords creates a vacuum that may have left history itself more vulnerable to change. In "[[The Unquiet Dead]]" (2005), the Doctor tells Rose that time is in flux, and history can change instantly &mdash; a more fluid definition to that which had been seen in earlier stories, which had implied that history was either immutable (''[[The Aztecs (Doctor Who)|The Aztecs]]'', 1964) or capable of being changed only by very powerful beings (''[[Pyramids of Mars]]'', 1975; ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'', 1988). The Doctor himself significantly alters history when he brings down the government of [[Harriet Jones]], whom he originally predicted would be elected for three terms and become the architect of Britain's "Golden Age". 

The most dramatic demonstration of this was in "[[Father's Day (Doctor Who)|Father's Day]]" (2005), when Rose creates a [[physical paradox|paradox]] by crossing her own timestream to save her father's life just before his destined death in a traffic accident. This summons the terrifying [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Reaper|Reapers]], who descended to "sterilise the wound" in time by devouring everything in sight. The Doctor states that if the [[Time Lord]]s were still around, they could have prevented or repaired the [[paradox]]. 

The consequences of creating a paradox are also why the Doctor cannot go back in time and save the Time Lords. Indeed, such actions may have directly contributed to their near-extinction: "They're all gone," the [[Ninth Doctor]] laments, "and now I'm going the same way." However, the [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]]'s use of the retrofitted [[TARDIS]] as a [[List of Doctor Who items#P|paradox machine]] in "[[The Sound of Drums]]" (2007) demonstrates another possible implementation of a paradox, while in the episode "[[Blink (Doctor Who)|Blink]]" (2007) Billy Shipton states that the [[Tenth Doctor]] warned him that trying to alter his own timeline after having been sent into the past would "destroy two-thirds of the universe."

In episode "[[School Reunion (Doctor Who)|School Reunion]]" (2006) while being tempted by the power of the Skasis Paradigm, which would give him the ability to reorder the universe, the Doctor muses that he can "stop the war." In "[[Rise of the Cybermen]]" (2006) the Doctor notes that when the Time Lords were around, travel between parallel universes was less difficult, but with their demise, the paths between worlds are now closed.

Other races also suffered casualties. The [[Auton|Nestene consciousness]] lost its homeworld and its protein-source planets, and the [[Gelth]] lost their physical form, being reduced to gaseous beings. The Time War also provides a convenient in-story explanation for any contradictions in series continuity: for example, Earth's destruction by an expanding sun in "The End of the World" as opposed to the original depiction of its demise around the year 10,000,000 (''[[The Ark (Doctor Who)|The Ark]]'', 1966) can be attributed to changes in history due to the War.

====Survivors====
Although the Doctor initially believes himself to be the last survivor of the Time War, in "[[The Parting of the Ways]]" (2005) he discovers that, in addition to the lone Dalek in "Dalek" the Dalek Emperor itself had also survived, and had gone on to build a whole new Dalek race, using the organic material of Human cadavers by completely rewriting their DNA. Whether this means that other Time Lords may have survived as well is unclear; though, as noted above, the Doctor is convinced that he would know of them (''tapping his head'': "In here") if they had. The destruction of the Emperor and his fleet at the conclusion of the 2005 series by a [[Time vortex (Doctor Who)|time vortex]]-augmented [[Rose Tyler]] is accompanied by her declaration that "the Time War ends." 

In "[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]" (2006) it is revealed the elite [[Dalek variants#Cult of Skaro|Cult of Skaro]] survived by fleeing into the [[List of Doctor Who planets#Others|Void]] between dimensions and survived the original end of the Time War, taking with them the [[List of Doctor Who items#G|Genesis Ark]], a Time Lord prison ship containing millions of Daleks. The new Dalek army released from the Ark is eventually sucked back into the Void, due to the actions of the Tenth Doctor, but the specially-equipped Cult of Skaro uses an "emergency temporal shift" to escape that fate. They reappear in New York, 1930 in "[[Daleks in Manhattan]]"/"[[Evolution of the Daleks]]" (2007); all but the [[Dalek Caan]] are killed in the story, leaving Caan as the last known living Dalek. Caan uses another emergency temporal shift to escape after the other three are killed.

In the 2007 episode "[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]" (2007) the [[Face of Boe]] says that while the Doctor is the "last of his kind," he is also somehow "not alone." This duality is explained in "[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]" (2007) where it is revealed that [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] had managed to survive his race's extinction by hiding in human form at the end of the universe, similar to how the Doctor had hidden from the [[List of Doctor Who villains#Family of Blood|Family of Blood]] in "[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]." Both used a device known as the [[List of Doctor Who items#C|Chameleon Arch]], which rewrites Time Lord DNA, changing the subject's species and giving them new memories, while storing the original biological configuration and consciousness in a fob-watch for safekeeping.

More nebulous, is the fate of the Doctor's former companion Romana. Davies has stated that he considers Roman's adventures during the period in which the series was cancelled (including leaving E-Space and becoming President of the Time Lords during the period of the Time War with the Daleks), meaning that Romana most likely perished in the final battle. However, since Davies and other writers have yet to officially acknowledge this on revelation onscreen, many  fans still consider Romana to still be in the "E-Space" universe and only presumed to be dead, for reasons yet to be revealed.

===''Doctor Who Annual 2006''===
The ''Doctor Who Annual 2006'', published by [[Panini Comics|Panini]] in August 2005, contains an article entitled ''Meet the Doctor'' by [[Russell T. Davies]], which provides some additional background information on the Time War as seen in the television series, also mentioning in passing events depicted in the novels, audios, and comic strips. Although the [[canon (fiction)#Doctor Who|canonicity]] of such material is debatable, the fact that Davies is the chief writer and executive producer of the television series may add some weight to the information given. Whether or not any of the material will be used as part of the television series is also unclear.

The article describes the Time Lord policy of non-intervention, but states that on a "higher level," they protected the [[Time vortex (Doctor Who)|time vortex]], and kept the peace. It further claims that two previous "Time Wars" had been fought: the first a skirmish between the Halldons (a race mentioned in the [[Terry Nation]] story ''We Are the Daleks'' from the ''[[Radio Times]]'' 10th Anniversary Special, 1973) and the Eternals (''[[Enlightenment (Doctor Who)|Enlightenment]]''). The second was the brutal slaughter of the Omnicraven Uprising, with the Time Lords intervening on both occasions to settle matters. 

The conflict between the Daleks and the Time Lords is described as "the Great (and final) Time War." Initial clashes included the Dalek attempt to infiltrate the High Council of the Time Lords with duplicates (''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]'', 1984), and the open declaration of hostilities by one of the Dalek Puppet Emperors (possibly ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]''); the Daleks claim these are merely in retaliation for the Time Lords' sending the Doctor back in time to change Dalek history in ''Genesis of the Daleks''.

The article says that historical records are uncertain, but mentions two specific events in the lead-up to the war.  The first was an attempted Dalek-Time Lord peace treaty initiated by President [[Romana]] under the Act of Master Restitution (a possible reference to the otherwise-unexplained trial of [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] on [[Skaro]] at the beginning of the [[Fox Network|FOX Network]] [[Doctor Who (1996)|''Doctor Who'' television movie]], 1996). The second was the Etra Prime Incident (''[[The Apocalypse Element]]''), which some say "began the escalation of events." Weapons used by the Time Lords included [[History of the Time Lords#On screen|Bowships]], Black Hole Carriers and [[N-form (Doctor Who)|N-Forms]] (the last from Davies' 1996 New Adventures novel ''[[Damaged Goods]]''), while the Daleks wielded "the full might of the Deathsmiths of Goth" (from the comic strip story ''Black Legacy'' by [[Alan Moore]] and [[David Lloyd (comic artist)|David Lloyd]], in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine|Doctor Who Weekly]]'' #35-#38), and launched a massive fleet into the vortex (possibly in ''[[The Time of the Daleks]]'').

The timelines of lesser races and planets shifted without the inhabitants of the worlds affected being aware of the [[retcon|changes in history]], as they were a part of them (presumably including [[Human]]s). "Higher species" who were able to notice the changes included the [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Forest of Cheem|Forest of Cheem]], who were distraught at the bloodshed; the [[Auton|Nestene Consciousness]], which lost all its planets, and further mutated; the [[List of Doctor Who villains#Animus|Greater Animus]], which died; the [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Eternal|Eternals]], who apparently fled this reality in despair, never to be seen again; and the [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Gelth|Gelth]], who were forced to take incorporeal form and hide themselves at the edge of the universe. The war lasted for years, and exactly how it ended is also not precisely known.

The article ends with a description of hierogylphics related to the Time War, carved on a mountainside on the distant planet Crafe Tec Heydra. There, under an image of a lone survivor walking away, the message "You are not alone" has been scratched, perhaps indicating that the Doctor was not the sole survivor of the conflict. <ref>{{cite book | last = Davies | first = Russell T | authorlink = Russell T Davies | title = The Doctor Who Annual 2006 | year = 2005 | publisher = Panini Books | location = Tunbridge Wells | id = ISBN 1-904419-73-9 | pages = 20<U+2013>21 | chapter = Meet the Doctor}}</ref> This is also the same message that the Face of Boe delivers to the Doctor in "Gridlock." On [[Martha Jones]]'s [http://www.myspace.com/marthajonesuk MySpace] page, it is revealed that she and the Tenth Doctor, just prior to the events of "[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]" (2007) visited the Eye of Orion (previously seen onscreen at the start of ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', 1983), where a shrine to the Time War stood. This may or may not be the same place mentioned in the ''Doctor Who Annual''.

===Gallifrey audio series===
''Gallifrey'' is the umbrella title of a series of audio plays by [[Big Finish Productions]], set on Gallifrey during Romana's tenure as President. In ''[[Gallifrey: Panacea]]'', the final chapter of the third series, the Time Lord [[Irving Braxiatel]] speaks of "rumours out there in the big wide universe &mdash; more than rumours, in fact &mdash; that something's coming to Gallifrey, something worse than you could possibly imagine."  

Because of these rumours, Braxiatel engineers the removal of the Time Lord biodata archive from Gallifrey, in order that the Time Lords might someday be restored after their planet meets its doom. Former Big Finish producer [[Gary Russell]] indicated in a forum posting on ''[[Outpost Gallifrey]]'' that this was a reference to the television series' Time War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallifreyone.net/forum/showpost.php?p=2886596&postcount=23|title="Gallifrey 3.5: Panacea" (requires free registation to view)|first=Gary|last=Russell|authorlink=Gary Russell|publisher=[[Outpost Gallifrey]]|date=[[2006-09-03]]|accessdate=2006-09-11}}</ref>

Like all spin-off media, its [[canon (fiction)#Doctor Who|canonicity]] in relation to the television series is unclear.

==Other Time Wars in ''Doctor Who''==
===Eighth Doctor Adventures===
In a [[story arc]] stretching through several of the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]], sometime in the Doctor's future, a war is fought between the Time Lords and an unnamed Enemy. In this story arc, Gallifrey is also destroyed as a result of the Eighth Doctor attempting to prevent the war from beginning (''[[The Ancestor Cell]]'', 2000). This cataclysm also creates an [[event horizon]] in time that prevents anyone from entering Gallifrey's relative past or travelling from it to the present or future. Presumably, if the novels and the television series events are to be reconciled, at some point Gallifrey is restored, only to be destroyed again in the Time War. The last Eighth Doctor Adventures novel, ''[[The Gallifrey Chronicles]]'', establishes that the Doctor has the ability to restore the planet and its inhabitants, but ends without revealing if he does so.

Series executive producer [[Russell T. Davies]] wrote in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' #356 that there is no connection between the War of the books and the Time War of the television series, comparing Gallifrey being destroyed twice with Earth's two World Wars.  He also said that he was "usually happy for old and new fans to invent the Complete History of the Doctor in their heads, completely free of the production team's hot and heavy hands."<ref>{{cite journal | first=Russell T | last=Davies | authorlink=Russell T Davies | title=The Evasion of Time| journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] | issue=356| pages=66<U+2013>67 | date=[[25 May]] [[2005]] }}</ref>

Despite Davies' unequivocal statement that the two wars are distinct, [[Lance Parkin]], in his ''Doctor Who'' chronology ''AHistory'', suggests in a speculative essay that the two destructions of Gallifrey may be the same event seen from two different perspectives, with the Eighth Doctor present twice (and both times culpable for the planet's destruction). This is supported due to the novels' destruction of Gallifrey involving an evil future version of the Eighth Doctor.<ref>{{cite book | first=Lance | last=Parkin | authorlink=Lance Parkin | editor=Additional material by [[Lars Pearson]]. | year=2006 | title=AHistory: An Unauthorised History of the Doctor Who Universe  | publisher=Mad Norwegian Press | location=Des Moines | id=ISBN 0-9725959-9-6 | pages=292<U+2013>293 }}</ref>

Another version of the Eighth Doctor Adventures' War, referred to as the "War in Heaven," also appears in the ''[[Faction Paradox]]'' novels conceived by [[Lawrence Miles]].

===''Doctor Who'' comic strip===
In three comic strip stories written by [[Alan Moore]] and published in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine|Doctor Who Monthly]]'', the Time Lords, assisted by [[Special Executive|The Special Executive]], fight a time war early in their history against the Order of the Black Sun, based some thirty thousand years in their future. 

The first strike of the war, from the Time Lords' point of view, is when a Black Sun agent travels back in time, and attacks the Time Lords just as they are about to turn the star Qqaba into a power source for their time experiments. This also causes the apparent demise of the stellar engineer [[Omega (Doctor Who)|Omega]]. The Time Lords do not know why the Black Sun (whom they had never encountered before the attack) should have wanted to strike at them, and surmise that it was for something they had yet to do (''Star Death'', ''DWM'' #47; ''The 4-D War'', ''DWM'' #51).

Years later, at a diplomatic conference, a representative of the Order is murdered by the [[Sontaran]]s, and the murder is blamed on the Time Lords. This provides the motivation for the war's beginnings, as from the Order's point of view, the Time Lords are the ones who strike first (''Black Sun Rising'', ''DWM'' #57).
