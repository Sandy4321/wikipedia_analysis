The '''Wine Country''' is a region of [[Northern California]] in the [[United States]] known worldwide as a premium [[wine]]-growing region.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fodor's Escape to the Wine Country: California's Napa, Sonoma, and Mendocino|publisher=Fodor's|isbn=9780679009184|year=2002|first=Thom|last=Elkjer}}</ref> [[Viticulture]] and wine-making have been practiced in the region since the mid-19th century. There are over 400 [[winery|wineries]] in the area north of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]],<ref name="fodors" /> mostly located in the area's valleys, including [[Napa Valley AVA|Napa Valley]] in [[Napa County, California|Napa County]], and the [[Sonoma Valley AVA|Sonoma Valley]], [[Alexander Valley AVA|Alexander Valley]], [[Dry Creek Valley AVA|Dry Creek Valley]], [[Bennett Valley AVA|Bennett Valley]], and [[Russian River Valley AVA|Russian River Valley]] in [[Sonoma County wine|Sonoma County]]. Wine grapes are also grown at higher elevations, such as [[Atlas Peak AVA|Atlas Peak]] and [[Mt. Veeder AVA|Mount Veeder]] [[American Viticultural Area|AVAs]].<ref>[http://wine.appellationamerica.com Appelation America.com]</ref> The region is defined not only in terms of viticulture, but also its [[ecology]], [[geology]], [[architecture]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Mary|last=Whitesides|title=Wine Country: Architecture and Interiors|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|year=2004}}</ref> [[cuisine]],<ref>Michael Chiarello, ''Michael Chiarello's Casual Cooking: Wine Country Recipes for Family and Friends'', Chronicle Books, San Francisco, California.</ref> and culture.<ref>Molly Chappellet, ''Gardens of the Wine Country'', Chronicle Books, San Francisco, California.</ref> The majority of the grape harvest, in terms of both area and value, derives from Sonoma County.<ref>[http://www.sonoma-county.org/edb/pdf/2007/Sonoma_County_indicators_2007.pdf Sonoma County Indicators: 2007]</ref>

Communities associated with the Wine Country include [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]], [[Kenwood, California|Kenwood]], [[Healdsburg, California|Healdsburg]], [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]],  [[Napa, California|Napa]], [[Yountville, California|Yountville]], [[St. Helena, California|St. Helena]], [[Calistoga, California|Calistoga]], [[Geyserville, California|Geyserville]], [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]], [[Sebastopol, California|Sebastopol]], [[Guerneville, California|Guerneville]], historic [[Fort Ross]] and [[Ukiah, California|Ukiah]].

==History==
[[Image:Yountville station.jpg|thumb|210px|left|[[Yountville, California|Yountville]] historic rail station, Napa Valley.]]

The earliest [[prehistory]] of the Wine Country involves habitation by several [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes since approximately 8000 BC.<ref>Stewart, Suzanne B., ''Time before Time: Prehistory and Archaeology in the Lake Sonoma Area''. Sacramento, CA: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1985.</ref>  The principal tribes living in this region were the [[Pomo]], [[Coast Miwok]], [[Wappo]] and [[Patwin]], whose early peoples practiced certain forms of [[agriculture]], but probably not involving the cultivation of grapes.  During the [[Mexico|Mexican]] Colonial period and after, [[Europe]]an settlers brought in more intensive agriculture to the Wine Country, including growing grapes and wine production. Some of the historical events that led to the establishment of California as a state transpired in the Wine Country. In particular, the town of [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]], is known as the birthplace of American California. [[Agoston Haraszthy]] is credited with being one of the forefathers of the [[California wine]] industry in Sonoma by his planting of grapes in the lower [[Arroyo Seco Creek]] [[drainage basin|watershed]] of Sonoma County.<ref>Charles Sullivan, ''Zinfandel: A History of a Grape and Its Wine'', Berkeley and Los Angeles, California: University of California Press, 2003.</ref>

As home to both Buena Vista winery, California's oldest commercial winery, and Gundlach Bundschu winery, California's oldest family-run winery, the [[Sonoma Valley]] is known as the birthplace of the California wine industry.

==Ecology==

A [[biodiversity|diversity]] of [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] and [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[organism]]s populate the Wine Country and its [[riparian zone]]s.  Winter-run [[Chinook salmon]] (''Oncorhynchus tsawytscha''), [[Delta smelt]] (''Hypomesus transpacificus'') and [[steelhead]] (''Onchorhynchus mykiss'') are the most prominent [[fish]]es.  [[Anadromous]] fish movements in Sonoma Creek and the [[Napa River]] as well as the [[Laguna de Santa Rosa]] have been studied extensively not only in the mainstems, but in many of the tributaries.  These investigations have demonstrated a historical decline in spawning and habitat value for these species, primarily due to sedimentation<ref name=SEC>''Sonoma Creek Watershed Limiting Factors Analysis'', Sonoma Ecology Center, with support from the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], December 2004.</ref> and secondarily to removal of riparian vegetation since the 19th century. 

A variety of [[salamander]]s, [[snake]]s and [[frogs]] are also present in the Wine Country.  The federally listed as threatened [[California red-legged frog]] is present in the northern reach draining the south slopes of [[Annadel State Park]].<ref> San Francisco Bay Area Conservancy Program [http://openspacecouncil.org/projects/conservancy/baosc_conservancy_2004.11.09_fifth_year_report.pdf Fifth Year Report] pg 19 </ref> Several [[endangered species]] (mostly associated with the [[Napa Sonoma Marsh]]) present include [[California clapper rail]] (''Rallus longirostris''), California [[Black Rail]] (''Laterallus jamaicensis''), California [[brown pelican]] (''Pelicanus occudentalis''), California freshwater shrimp (''[[Syncaris pacifica]]''), [[Salt marsh harvest mouse]] (''Reithrodontomys raviventris'' ), [[Suisun Shrew]] (''Sorex ornatus sinuosus)'', [[Sacramento splittail]] (''Pogonichtys macrolepidotus''). The above are [[endangered species]] with the exception of the splittail, steelhead and black rail, which species are federally designated as Threatened.<ref> [http://sfep.abag.ca.gov/pdf/habitat_goals/Habitat_Goals%5BPart3%5D.pdf Baylands Ecosystem Habitat Goals]</ref>

Upland ecosystems drained include mixed [[California oak woodland]], [[chaparral]] and [[savannah]] [[woodland]].<ref> [http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/ca162.htm California's woodlands]</ref> In these upland reaches one finds plentiful [[Black-tailed Deer]], [[coyote]], skunk, raccoon, opossum, [[wild turkey]], [[turkey vulture]], [[red-tailed hawk]] and occasionally bobcat and [[mountain lion]]. Prominent higher elevation trees include: [[Coast live oak]], [[Garry Oak]], [[Pacific madrone]], [[California Buckeye]],  [[Douglas fir]], whereas [[Valley oak]] is prevalent on the Wine Country valley floors.<ref>[http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr100/psw_gtr100d.pdf Wildlife:The Importance of Hardwood Habitat for Wildlife in California], [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]], [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], 1987</ref>

==Tourism==

The Wine Country has undergone a boom in tourism. In 1975 there were only 25 Napa Valley wineries; today there are well over 400 wineries in Napa and Sonoma Counties.<ref name="fodors">{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/miniguides/mgresults.cfm?destination=california_wine@211|title=Fodor's California Wine Country Online|year=2006}}</ref> Tourists come to the region not only for wine-tasting, but also for [[hiking]], [[bicycle|bicycling]], [[hot air balloon]]ing, and historic sites, as well as the extensive culinary choices. Numerous notable chefs and restaurateurs are present in the Wine Country, including [[Thomas Keller]], [[John Ash]], and Sondra Bernstein.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=0743255216|first=Sondra|last=Bernstein|title=The Girl & the Fig Cookbook: More than 100 Recipes from the Acclaimed California Wine Country Restaurant|year=2004}}</ref> Besides the obvious winery attractions, the Wine Country is known for its [[hot springs]] baths, [[petrified forest]]s and other natural areas.

The Wine Country tourism boom has its downside, exemplified by traffic congestion on [[California State Route 29|State Route 29]], particularly on summer weekends, when the number of tourists often exceeds the [[carrying capacity]] of the road. The Napa Valley is also experiencing pressures for increased urbanization and roadway upgrading.<ref>[http://www.napatraffic.info/Trancas%2029.htm Trancas Road/California State Route 29 Intersection Improvements]</ref>
