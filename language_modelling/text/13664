'''Lough Lene''' is situated in North Westmeath (in Irish "Iarmh<U+00ED> ") between the villages of [[Castlepollard]], [[Collinstown]] and [[Fore Abbey|Fore]].
It possesses a rich and varied history. It also boasts the existence of prehistoric burial sites old ruins, many ancient village type communal circular dwellings locally called [[Ringforts]], [[stile]]s, and [[mass path]]. Lough Lene also has claims to being the home to Kings and tyarant Vikings, such as [[Turgesius]] who had one of his forts upon the hill on the south-west overlooking the lake from the Ranaghan side, before being killed by [[M<U+00E1>el Sechnaill mac Ma<U+00ED>l Ruanaid]].

In addition, the lake has close links with the religious nuns, see [[Collinstown]] and Saints and monks associated with [[Fore Abbey]].

==Legend & Historical==

The name of the lake has appeared in a variety of ways including Lane, L<U+00E9>in and Leibhinn. Sir Henry Piers believed the lake's name translated as Lake of Learning, tying in with his translation of Fore as the Town of Books. However, other souces seem more inclined to the tradition that the lake was named after the daughter of the fabled Mannanan Mac Lir. [[Children of Lir]] 
The lake is described in Lewis's Topographical as being an irregular oval shape, possibly 3.2 km (2 miles) long by 1.7 km (1 mile) broad, A freshwater lake, most sources focus on the clarity of the water, with the term "gin clear " being used frequently to describe it. It sits approximately 97 m (312 ft) above sea level and covers approximately 500 hectares. It plays a vital part in local life from being the water supply for Collinstown to playing an essential part in the social, historical and recreational life of the area.

Nun's Island on Lough Lene, where once a convent protected devoted women to God once lived. Baile na gCailleach, the old Irish name for the town of Collinstown, when translated means "the town of the veiled women, or "the town of the old hags". This was an irreverent name which referred to the nuns of the convent on the island of Lough Lene.

The two other islands are Castle Island, and [[Turgesius]]' island. (see also Turgesius at)[http://www.ncte.ie/viking/colm2.htm]

European survey revealed that Nun's Island was a complex stone structure with causeway-like features, while Castle Island showed the best potential, with a large assemblage of worked timbers. Two logboats were also recovered in 1968,  one with dovetail joints. This work continues today [http://www.askaboutireland.ie/image_large?asset_id=7657]. These Roman-period log-boats were constructed fore inland  lake fishing, about 8m long, 1.5m wide, and 80cm deep, were made of oak, Yew, and possibly willow. The boats were paddle propelled,  Other notable constructional features are that they were complex boats: Carved; Dugout (extended); Mortice-and-tenon; and Sewn.


==Recent Times==
Gin-clear Lough Lene In more recent times, since [[Ireland]] joined with Europe, Lough Lene is also known as the first in-land and fresh-water lake to obtain a European Blue Flag for it's pollution free gin-clear water. This has been allocated with remarkable regularity to Lough Lene due to the surrounding agricultural communities<U+2019> commitment to preserving this water resource and habitat, for fish and wild-life. Lough Lene clear lake water also acts as a reservoir for many neighbouring surrounding villages and supplies from the Lough-Park pumping station, neighbouring surroundings such as [[Castlepollard]] and Collinstown and Fore. Collinstown in association with Glenidan, and Richardstown have come together to form a successful G.A.A. club called the [[Lough Lene Gaels]]: [http://www.geocities.com/loughlenegaels]

==Water sport Activities== 
Bathing, [[sailing]], [[wind-surfing]], for beginners, swimming facilities, dressing-rooms, pic-nic areas, are available to tourists at the lake point locally referred to as "the Cut" about 2km north from the Collinstown cross-roads. "The Cut" [http://mapage.noos.fr/lough-lene/images/lough-lene3.JPG]is situated on the east end of the lake.
