The '''[[Second Boer War]]''' was fought from [[11 October]] [[1899]] until [[31 May]] [[1902]], between the [[British Empire]] and the two independent [[Boer]] republics of the [[Orange Free State]] and the [[South African Republic]] (Transvaal Republic). It was a lengthy war involving large numbers of troops which ended with the conversion of the Boer republics into British colonies, with a promise of limited [[self-governance|self-government]]. These colonies later formed part of the [[Union of South Africa]].

During the Boer war 22,000 troops were treated for wounds inflicted during battle and the Medical Department of the army mobilized 151 staff and regimental units. There were 28 field ambulances, five stationary hospitals and 16 general hospitals established to deal with casualties. Numerous voluntary organizations set up further hospitals and medical units and first aid posts. One thousand or so Indians from [[Natal]] were shipped over to help in the recovery effort in transporting the wounded off the battlefields. Even [[Mahatma Gandhi]] who was practising as a lawyer at the time in [[Durban]] was a volunteer, helping recovery efforts in the Battles of Colenso and Spionkop. A second unit was established by [[Johannesburg]] and [[Cape Town]] Jews aiding both armies.

==Implications in recovery==
In the early battles of the war, the recovery team carrying stretchers would walk onto the battlefield in the firing zone as soon as a man was wounded and carry him off. Soldiers participating in the battle would also help. However, in doing so this reduced the numbers in active battle and the Boers soon gained a reputation for rapid firing at any moving person, soldier or paramedic. As a result, being wounded in the war and recovery was seriously affected, often forcing the casualties to be retrieved after dusk, meaning they had either died or could not be located very easily in the dark.

During the early weeks of the war, the Boers were reported to be using poisoned bullets which worsened the infection of British soldier wounds. Although the rifles used in the war were not intended to inflict massive damage, the Boers used German [[Mauser]] rifles which were known for creating clean wounds. However the bullets they used, described as "Dum-dums" were made from a soft [[lead]] which would expand upon impact or were modified by cutting through the outer case of a normal bullet to affect the way the opposing army was wounded. Boer bullets retrieved from wounded soldiers in the battlefields were often found to contain a green fat coating, which had been used to lubricate the chamber and rifle barrel. However, many wounded in battle that survived, described the wounds inflicted by the Boers as painless initially but would increase in pain gradually. Many described the experience as being "tapped with a hammer" or "being less painful than the drawing of a tooth". However, many suffered considerably. One British Sergeant shot during the Siege of Ladysmith described the woundin as follows:

"As the morning came, firing was very heavy and two Boers were shooting over the very rock behind which I lay...As the sun rose, the heat became intense and the wound gave me anxiety and pain and I could not stop bleeding. I took the puttee off my right leg and tied it tightly above the left knee and tried to stop the dripping but without avail. However, I found that the blood on the ground had congealed in the intense heat."    

==Surgical developments==
Of the 22,000 that were treated for wounds during the Second Boer War, the majority survived, largely due to the efficiency of the medical teams which cared for the affected. The [[Royal Army Medical Corps]], which had formed after the redunduncies of the [[Crimean War]], played a key role in the treatment of the wounded in the Boer War, and the salaries of medical corps soldiers had gradually increased and training improved, improving the system and quality of the medical services. Surgery had made considerable advancement in the late nineteenth century, and the army surgery facilities were considered state of the art at the time. In 1899 the RAMC had recruited a number of specialist surgeons in its ranks to treat the wounded, including many of notable prestige, including [[Frederick Treyes]], [[Watson Chyne]], Sir [[Wiliam MacCormac]], [[William Stokes]], [[Kendal Franks]] and [[G.L. Cheatle]]. [[George Henry Makins]], a prominent surgeon during the Boer War published a textbook of military surgery in 1901.

==Treatment==
Casualties during the Boer War were generally recovered in stages. Battalion doctors located on the battlefields would take the wounded by stretcher to a dressing station for initial treatment. This included the widespread use of field dressings consisting of a sterile gauze pad stitched to the bandage and covered with waterproofing. Each pack contained two dressings and numerous safety pins. Later they would be taken to ambulances or stationary hospitals where the complex recovery by the surgeons coould be carried out. However, given the number of casualties in relation to staff, it was often days before a wounded soldier could see a doctor for full treatment, increasing the extent of the infection of the wounds.
