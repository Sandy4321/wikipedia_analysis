'''''Wizard Of Wor''''' is an [[arcade game]] from 1980, developed by [[Midway Games|Midway]], and later ported to the [[Commodore 64]] as well as the [[Atari_2600|Atari 2600]]. The title of the game is often incorrectly spelled as "Wizard of War". The game was released as part of the compilation game [[Midway Arcade Treasures 2]] in [[2004]].

==Gameplay==
''Wizard Of Wor'' is an action-oriented game for one or two players. The game takes the form of several [[maze]]-like dungeons infested with [[monster]]s. The players' characters, called Worriors, have to kill all the monsters.

Each dungeon is in the form of a single-screen rectangular grid with walls and corridors in various formations. The Worriors and the monsters can travel freely through the corridors. Player one has blue Worriors and player two has yellow Worriors.

The various monsters include the following:
* Burwor: A blue [[lion]]-type creature.
* Garwor: A yellow [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]]-type creature.
* Thorwor: A red [[scorpion]]-like creature. Has the ability to turn invisible, thus it can only been seen with the [[radar]].
* Worluk: A [[hornet]]-type creature.
* Wizard Of Wor: A blue [[wizard]].
Normally, each dungeon starts filled with Burwors. Shooting a Burwor makes a Garwor appear, if one is not already present. Shooting a Garwor makes a Thorwor appear, if one is not already present. Later dungeons may include multiple Garwors and/or Thorwors at the same time. Each dungeon has doors at the left and right edges, which connect with each other, making the dungeon wrap around. Whenever these are used, they will deactivate, making them work as a normal wall. After a certain amount of time, they will reactivate. They can be used by both Worriors and monsters.

The Worluk and the Wizard Of Wor only appear in special "bonus dungeons". There are two types of bonus dungeon, one for the Worluk and one for the Wizard Of Wor. In the Worluk dungeon, Worriors move slower than normal. The Wizard Of Wor is able to [[teleport]] randomly across the dungeon. If the Worluk or Wizard Of Wor escapes through the door at the left or right edge before being shot, the bonus dungeon is lost. In these bonus dungeons, the doors at the left and right edges are permanently active.

The Wizard of Wor himself is a [[Cyborg]] (he has a human face, but robotic eyes and hands) who possesses powers of [[teleportation]] and attacks the player with Magic. He lacks visible legs. He uses a speech synthesizer to taunt the player.


In a two-player game, the players are also able to shoot each other's Worriors, earning bonus points but causing the other player to lose a life.

==Legacy==
Wizard Of Wor today has a cult following among nostalgic gamers, and is often coined as one of the archetypal one-on-one dungeon fighter games. Also, while the music of the game was simple and for the most part it only consisted from a few measures played with one instrument, fans of the game often recite the melody at the infamous "GET READY GO" screen, similarly to the soundtrack of [[Jaws]].{{fact}}


At one point in the film [[Monster House (film)|Monster House]], the "ha-ha-ha-ha" sound bite can be heard.
