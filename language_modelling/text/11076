'''Rock music''' is a genre of [[popular music]] that developed during and after the 1960s, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom. It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s [[rock and roll]], itself heavily influenced by [[rhythm and blues]] and [[country music]]. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as [[blues]] and [[folk music|folk]], and incorporated influences from [[jazz]], [[classical music|classical]] and other musical sources. 

Musically, rock has centred around the [[electric guitar]], usually as part of a [[rock group]] with [[bass guitar]] and [[drum kit|drums]]. Typically, rock is song-based music with a 4/4 beat utilizing a [[verse-chorus form]], but the genre has become extremely diverse and common musical characteristics are difficult to define. Like [[pop music]], lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political in emphasis. The dominance of rock by white, male musicians has been seen as one of the key factors shaping the themes explored in rock music. Unlike pop music, rock places an emphasis on musicianship, live performance, and an ideology of authenticity.

By the late 1960s a number of distinct rock music sub-genres had emerged, including hybrids like [[folk rock]], [[blues-rock]], [[country rock]] and [[jazz fusion|jazz-rock fusion]], many of which contributed to the development of [[psychedelic rock]] influenced by the [[counterculture|counter-cultural]] psychedelic scene. New genres that emerged from this scene included [[progressive rock]], which extended the artistic elements; [[glam rock]], which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse and enduring major sub-genre of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], which emphasized volume and power. In the second half of the 1970s, [[punk rock]] both intensified and reacted against some of these trends to produce a raw, energetic form of music characterized by overt political and social critiques. Punk was an influence into the 1980s on the subsequent development of other sub-genres, including [[New Wave music|New Wave]], [[post punk]] and eventually the [[alternative rock]] movement. From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of [[grunge]], [[Britpop]], and [[indie rock]]. Further fusion sub-genres have since emerged, including [[pop punk]], [[rap rock]], and [[rap metal]], as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history, including the [[garage rock]]/[[post punk revival]] at the beginning of the new millennium. 

Rock music has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements, leading to major sub-cultures including [[Mod (subculture)|mods]] and [[Rocker (subculture)|rockers]] in the UK and the "[[hippie]]" counterculture that spread out from San Francisco in the US in the 1960s. Similarly, 1970s [[punk culture]] spawned the visually distinctive [[Goth (subculture)|goth]] and [[emo]] subcultures. Inheriting the folk tradition of the [[protest song]], rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race, sex and drug use, and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult [[consumerism]] and conformity.

The sound of rock is traditionally centered around the [[electric guitar]], which emerged in its modern form in the 1950s with the popularization of rock and roll.<ref>J. M.

C. Brewer, "Bass Guitar" in J. Shepherd, ed., ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Volume II: Performance and Production'' (New York, NY: Continuum, 2003), ISBN 0826463223, p. 56.</ref> and percussion produced from a [[drum kit]] that combines drums and cymbals.<ref>R. Mattingly, "Drum Set", in J. Shepherd, ed., ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Volume II: Performance and Production'' (New York, NY: Continuum, 2003), ISBN 0826463223, p. 361.</ref> This trio of instruments has often been complemented by the inclusion of others, particularly keyboards such as the [[piano]], [[Hammond organ]] and [[synthesizer]]s.<ref>P. Th<U+00E9>berge, ''Any Sound you can Imagine: Making Music/Consuming Technology'' (Middletown, CT, Wesleyan University Press, 1997), ISBN 0819563099, pp. 69-70.</ref> A group of musicians performing rock music is termed a [[rock band]] or [[rock group]] and typically consists of two and five members. Most traditionally, a rock band takes the form of a [[quartet]] whose members cover one or more roles, including [[vocals|vocalist]], [[lead guitar|lead guitarist]], [[rhythm guitar|rhythm guitarist]], [[bass guitarist]], [[drummer]] and occasionally that of [[keyboard player]] or other [[instrumentalist]].<ref>D. Laing, "Quartet", in J. Shepherd, ed., ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Volume II: Performance and Production'' (New York, NY: Continuum, 2003), ISBN 0826463223, p. 56.</ref>

Rock music is traditionally built on a foundation of simple unsyncopated rhythms in a 4/4 [[Meter (music)|meter]], with a repetitive snare drum [[Beat (music)#Backbeat|back beat]] on beats two and four.<ref name=Ammer2004>C. Ammer, ''The Facts on File Dictionary of Music'' (New York, NY: Infobase, 4th edn., 2004), ISBN 0816052662, pp. 251-2.</ref> Melodies are often derived from older [[musical modes]], including the [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] and [[Mixolydian]], as well as [[major (music)|major]] and [[minor (music)|minor]] modes. Harmonies range from the common [[Triad (music)|triad]] to parallel [[Perfect fourth|fourths]] and [[Perfect fifth|fifths]] and dissonant harmonic progressions.<ref name=Ammer2004/> Rock songs from the mid-1960s onwards often used the [[Verse-chorus form|verse-chorus structure]] derived from blues and folk music, but there has been considerable variation from this model.<ref>J. Covach, "From craft to art: formal structure in the music of the Beatles", in K. Womack and Todd F. Davis, eds, ''Reading the Beatles: Cultural Studies, Literary Criticism, and the Fab Four'' (New York, NY: SUNY Press, 2006), ISBN 0791467155, p. 40.</ref> Critics have stressed the eclecticism and stylistic diversity of rock.<ref>T. Gracyk, ''Rhythm and Noise: an Aesthetics of Rock'', (London: I. B. Tauris, 1996), ISBN 1860640907, p. xi.</ref> Because of its complex history and tendency to borrow from other musical and cultural forms, it has been argued that "it is impossible to bind rock music to a rigidly delineated musical definition."<ref>P. Wicke, ''Rock Music: Culture, Aesthetics and Sociology'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), ISBN 0521399149, p. x.</ref> 

Unlike many earlier styles of popular music, rock lyrics have dealt with a wide range of themes in additional to romantic love, including sex, rebellion against the establishment, social concerns and life styles.<ref name=Ammer2004/> These themes were inherited from a variety of sources, including the [[Tin Pan Alley]] pop tradition, folk music and rhythm and blues.<ref>B. A. Farber, ''Rock 'n' roll Wisdom: What Psychologically Astute Lyrics Teach About Life and Love'' (Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2007), ISBN 0275991644, pp. xxvi-xxviii.</ref> The predominance of white, male and often middle class musicians in rock music has often been noted<ref>C. McDonald, ''Rush, Rock Music and the Middle Class: Dreaming in Middletown'' (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2009), ISBN 0253354080, pp. 108-9.</ref> and rock has been seen as an appropriation of black musical forms for a young, white and large male audience.<ref>S. Waksman, ''Instruments of Desire: the Electric Guitar and the Shaping of Musical Experience'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2001), ISBN 0674005473, p. 176.</ref> As a result it has been seen as articulating the concerns of this group in both style and lyrics.<ref>S. Frith, ''Taking Popular Music Seriously: Selected Essays'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), ISBN 0754626792, pp. 43-4.</ref>

Since the term rock began to be used in preference to rock and roll from the mid 1960s, it has often been contrasted with pop music, with which it has shared many characteristics, but from which it is often distanced by an emphasis on musicianship, live performance and a focus on serious and progressive themes as part of an ideology of authenticity that is frequently combined with an awareness of the genre's history and development.<ref name=Warner2003>T. Warner, ''Pop Music: Technology and Creativity: Trevor Horn and the Digital Revolution'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2003), ISBN 0-7546-3132-X, pp. 3-4.</ref> According to [[Simon Frith]] "rock was something more than pop, something more than rock and roll. Rock musicians combined an emphasis on skill and technique with the romantic concept of art as artistic expression, original and sincere".<ref name=Warner2003/> In the new millennium the term ''rock'' has sometimes been used as a [[blanket term]] including forms such as [[pop music]], [[reggae music]], [[soul music]], and even [[hip hop]], with which it has been influenced but often contrasted through much of its history.<ref>R. Beebe, D. Fulbrook and B. Saunders, "Introduction" in R. Beebe, D. Fulbrook, B.

The foundations of rock music are in rock and roll, which originated in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world. Its immediate origins lay in a mixing together of various [[African-American music|black musical]] genres of the time, including [[rhythm and blues]] and [[gospel music]], with [[country music|country and western]].<ref name="Bogdanov2002BrithofR&R">R. Unterberger, "Birth of Rock & Roll", in V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, eds, ''All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul'' (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), ISBN 0-87930-653-X, pp. 1303-4.</ref> In 1951, [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]] disc jockey [[Alan Freed]] began playing rhythm and blues music for a multi-racial audience, and is credited with first using the phrase "rock and roll" to describe the music.<ref>T. E. Scheurer, ''American Popular Music: The Age of Rock'' (Madison, WI: Popular Press, 1989), ISBN 0-87972-468-4, p. 170.</ref>

There is much debate as to what should be considered the [[first rock and roll record]]. One contender is "[[Rocket 88]]" by [[Jackie Brenston]] and his Delta Cats (in fact, [[Ike Turner]] and his band The Kings of Rhythm), recorded by [[Sam Phillips]] for [[Sun Records]] in 1951.<ref name=Campbell2008>M. Campbell, ed., ''Popular Music in America: and the Beat Goes on'' (Boston, MA: Cengage Learning, 3rd edn., 2008), ISBN 0-495-50530-7, pp. 157<U+2013>8.</ref> Four years later, [[Bill Haley]]'s "[[Rock Around the Clock]]" (1955) became the first rock and roll song to top [[Billboard magazine]]'s main sales and airplay charts, and opened the door worldwide for this new wave of popular culture.<ref>P. Browne, ''The Guide to United States Popular Culture'' (Madison, WI: Popular Press, 2001), ISBN 0-87972-821-3, p. 358.</ref>

It has been argued that "[[That's All Right (Mama)]]" (1954), [[Elvis Presley]]'s first single for Sun Records in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], was the first rock and roll record,<ref>{{Citation | last = N. McCormick | title = The day Elvis changed the world | journal = The Telegraph | date = 24 June 2004 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3619493/The-day-Elvis-changed-the-world.html | archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5wQTh7wT7| archivedate =11 February 2011}}.</ref> but, at the same time, [[Big Joe Turner]]'s "[[Shake, Rattle & Roll]]", later covered by Haley, was already at the top of the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Billboard R&B charts]]. Other artists with early rock and roll hits included [[Chuck Berry]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Little Richard]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], and [[Gene Vincent]].<ref name=Campbell2008/> Soon rock and roll was the major force in American record sales and [[crooner]]s, such as [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]], [[Perry Como]], and [[Patti Page]], who had dominated the previous decade of popular music, found their access to the pop charts significantly curtailed.<ref>R. S. Denisoff, W. L. Schurk, ''Tarnished Gold: the Record Industry Revisited'' (New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction, 3rd edn., 1986), ISBN 0-88738-618-0, p. 13.</ref>

Rock and roll has been seen as leading to a number of distinct sub-genres, including rockabilly, combining rock and roll with "hillbilly" country music, which was usually played and recorded in the mid-1950s by white singers such as [[Carl Perkins]], Jerry Lee Lewis, [[Buddy Holly]] and with the greatest commercial success, Elvis Presley.<ref name=AllmusicRbilly>{{Citation | last = | title = Rockabilly | journal = Allmusic | url = {{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d187|pure_url=yes}} | archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5wQb3jHWo| archivedate =11 February 2011}}.</ref> In contrast [[doo wop]] placed an emphasis on multi-part vocal harmonies and meaningless backing lyrics (from which the genre later gained its name), which were usually supported with light instrumentation and had its origins in 1930s and '40s African American vocal groups.<ref>R. Shuker, ''Popular Music: the Key Concepts'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2nd edn., 2005), ISBN 0-415-34770-X, p. 35.</ref> Acts like [[The Crows]], [[The Penguins]], [[The El Dorados]] and [[The Turbans]] all scored major hits, and groups like [[The Platters]], with songs including "[[The Great Pretender]]" (1955), and [[The Coasters]] with humorous songs like "[[Yakety Yak]]" (1958), ranked among the most successful rock and roll acts of the period.<ref name=Bogdanov2002DooWop/> The era also saw the growth in popularity of the [[electric guitar]], and the development of a specifically rock and roll style of playing through such exponents as Chuck Berry, [[Link Wray]], and [[Scotty Moore]].<ref>J. M. Curtis, ''Rock Eras: Interpretations of Music and Society, 1954<U+2013>1984'' (Madison, WI: Popular Press, 1987), ISBN 0-87972-369-6, p. 73.</ref>

In the United Kingdom, the [[trad jazz]] and [[English folk music|folk]] movements brought visiting [[blues music]] artists to Britain.<ref name=Schwartz2007>R. F. Schwartz, ''How Britain Got the Blues: the Transmission and Reception of American Blues Style in the United Kingdom'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), ISBN 0-7546-5580-6, p. 22.</ref> [[Lonnie Donegan]]'s 1955 hit "[[Rock Island Line (song)|Rock Island Line]]" was a major influence and helped to develop the trend of [[skiffle music]] groups throughout the country, many of which, including [[John Lennon]]'s [[The Quarrymen]], moved on to play rock and roll.<ref>J. Roberts, ''The Beatles'' (Mineappolis, MN: Lerner Publications, 2001), ISBN 0-8225-4998-0, p. 13.</ref>

Commentators have traditionally perceived a decline of rock and roll in the late 1950s and early 1960s. By 1959, the death of Buddy Holly, [[The Big Bopper]] and [[Richie Valens]] in a plane crash, the departure of Elvis for the army, the retirement of Little Richard to become a preacher, prosecutions of Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry and the breaking of the [[payola]] scandal (which implicated major figures, including Alan Freed, in bribery and corruption in promoting individual acts or songs), gave a sense that the initial rock and roll era had come to an end.<ref name=Campbell2008>M.

The period of the later 1950s and early 1960s, between the end of the initial period of innovation and what became known in the USA as the "[[British Invasion]]", has traditionally been seen as an era of hiatus for rock and roll. More recently some authors have emphasised important innovations and trends in this period without which future developments would not have been possible.<ref>B. Bradby, "Do-talk, don't-talk: the division of the subject in girl-group music" in S. Frith and A. Goodwin, eds, ''On Record: Rock, Pop, and the Written Word'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 1990), ISBN 0-415-05306-4, p. 341.</ref><ref name=Keightley2001/> While early rock and roll, particularly through the advent of rockabilly, saw the greatest commercial success for male and white performers, in this era the genre was dominated by black and female artists. Rock and roll had not disappeared at the end of the 1950s and some of its energy can be seen in the [[Twist (dance)|Twist]] dance craze of the early '60s, mainly benefiting the career of [[Chubby Checker]].<ref name=Keightley2001/> Having died down in the late 1950s, doo wop enjoyed a revival in the same period, with hits for acts like [[The Marcels]], [[The Capris]], Maurice Williams and [[Shep and the Limelights]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002DooWop>R. Unterberger, "Doo Wop", in V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T.

Dale, ''Education and the State: Politics, Patriarchy and Practice'' (London: Taylor & Francis, 1981), ISBN 0-905273-17-6, p. 106.</ref> Some of the most significant girl group hits were products of the [[Brill Building]] Sound, named after the block in New York where many songwriters were based, which included the number 1 hit for the Shirelles "[[Will You Love Me Tomorrow]]" in 1960, penned by the partnership of [[Gerry Goffin]] and [[Carole King]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002Brill>R.

[[Cliff Richard]] had the first [[British rock and roll]] hit with "[[Move It]]", effectively ushering in the sound of [[British rock]].<ref>D. Hatch and S. Millward, ''From Blues to Rock: an Analytical History of Pop Music'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1987), ISBN 0-7190-1489-1, p. 78.</ref> At the start of the 1960s, his backing group [[The Shadows]] was the most successful group recording instrumentals.<ref>A. J. Millard, ''The Electric Guitar: a History of an American Icon'' (Baltimore, MD: JHU Press, 2004), ISBN 0-8018-7862-4, p. 150.</ref> While rock 'n' roll was fading into lightweight pop and ballads, British [[rock group]]s at clubs and local dances, heavily influenced by blues-rock pioneers like [[Alexis Korner]], were starting to play with an intensity and drive seldom found in white American acts.<ref name=Bogdanov2003BritishBlues>B.

Also significant was the advent of [[soul music]] as a major commercial force. Developing out of rhythm and blues with a re-injection of gospel music and pop, led by pioneers like [[Ray Charles]] and [[Sam Cooke]] from the mid-1950s, by the early '60s figures like [[Marvin Gaye]], [[James Brown]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Curtis Mayfield]] and [[Stevie Wonder]] were dominating the R&B charts and breaking through into the main pop charts, helping to accelerate their desegregation, while [[Motown]] and [[Stax/Volt]] Records were becoming major forces in the record industry.<ref name=Bogdanov2002Soul>R.

=== Surf music ===
{{Main|Surf music}}
The instrumental rock and roll pioneered by performers such as [[Duane Eddy]], Link Wray, and [[The Ventures]] was developed by [[Dick Dale]] who added distinctive "wet" [[reverb]], rapid alternate picking, as well as Middle Eastern and Mexican influences, producing the regional hit "[[Let's Go Trippin']]" in 1961 and launching the surf music craze. Like Dale and his [[Del-Tones]], most early surf bands were formed in Southern California, including the [[Bel-Airs]], the [[The Challengers (band)|Challengers]], and [[Eddie & the Showmen]].<ref>J. Blair, ''The Illustrated Discography of Surf Music, 1961<U+2013>1965'' (Ypsilanti, MI: Pierian Press, 2nd edn., 1985), ISBN 0-87650-174-9, p. 2.</ref> [[The Chantays]] scored a top ten national hit with "[[Pipeline (song)|Pipeline]]" in 1963 and probably the best known surf tune was 1963's "[[Wipe Out (song)|Wipe Out]]", by the [[Surfaris]], which hit number 2 and number 10 on the Billboard charts in 1965.<ref>J.

The growing popularity of the genre led groups from other areas to try their hand. These included [[The Astronauts (US band)|The Astronauts]], from [[Boulder, Colorado]], [[The Trashmen]], from [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], who had a number 4 hit with "Surfin Bird" in 1964 and [[The Rivieras]] from [[South Bend, Indiana]], who reached number 5 in 1964 with "California Sun".<ref name=Bogdanov2002Surf>R.

Surf music achieved its greatest commercial success as vocal music, particularly the work of the [[Beach Boys]], formed in 1961 in Southern California. Their early albums included both instrumental surf rock (among them covers of music by Dick Dale) and vocal songs, drawing on rock and roll and [[doo wop]] and the close harmonies of vocal pop acts like the [[Four Freshmen]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002Surf/> Their first chart hit, "[[Surfin']]" in 1962 reached the Billboard top 100 and helped make the surf music craze a national phenomenon.<ref name=Bogdanov2002Beachboys>W.

T. O." (1964) and [[Rip Chords]] with "Hey Little Cobra", which both reached the top ten, but the only other act to achieve sustained success with the formula were [[Jan & Dean]], who had a number 1 hit with "Surf City" (co-written with Brian Wilson) in 1963.<ref name=Bogdanov2002Surf/> The surf music craze and the careers of almost all surf acts was effectively ended by the arrival of the British Invasion from 1964.<ref name=Bogdanov2002Surf/> Only the Beach Boys were able to sustain a creative career into the mid-1960s, producing a string of hit singles and albums, including the highly regarded ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' in 1966, which made them, arguably, the only American rock or pop act that could rival The Beatles.<ref name=Bogdanov2002Beachboys/>

There was, however, particularly in the early stages, considerable musical crossover between the two tendencies.<ref name=Bogdanov2002BI/> By 1963, led by the Beatles, beat groups had begun to achieve national success in Britain, soon to be followed into the charts by the more rhythm and blues focused acts.<ref name=Bogdanov2002BritishR&B>R.

In 1964 the Beatles achieved a breakthrough to mainstream popularity in the United States.

By the 1960s, the scene that had developed out of the [[American folk music revival]] had grown to a major movement, utilising traditional music and new compositions in a traditional style, usually on acoustic instruments.<ref name=Mitchell2007p95>G.

Psychedelic music's [[LSD]]-inspired vibe began in the folk scene, with the New York-based [[Holy Modal Rounders]] using the term in their 1964 recording of "[[Hesitation Blues]]".<ref name=Hicks2000>M.

Psychedelic rock particularly took off in California's emerging music scene as groups followed the Byrds from folk to folk rock from 1965.<ref name=Bogdanov2002Psych/> The psychedelic life style had already developed in San Francisco and particularly prominent products of the scene were [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Country Joe and the Fish]], [[The Great Society (band)|The Great Society]] and [[Jefferson Airplane]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002Psych/> The Byrds rapidly progressed from purely folk rock in 1966 with their single "[[Eight Miles High]]", widely taken to be a reference to drug use. In Britain arguably the most influential band in the genre were The Yardbirds,<ref name=Bogdanov2002Psych/> who, with Jeff Beck as their guitarist, increasingly moved into psychedelic territory, adding up-tempo improvised "rave ups", Gregorian chant and world music influences to songs including "Still I'm Sad" (1965) and "Over Under Sideways Down" (1966).<ref name="Buckley2003Yardbirds">A.

Psychedelic rock reached its apogee in the last years of the decade. 1967 saw the Beatles release their definitive psychedelic statement in ''[[Sgt.

Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, [[Brian Jones]] of the Rolling Stones, [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] of Fleetwood Mac and [[Syd Barrett]] of Pink Floyd were early "acid casualties", the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Cream broke up before the end of the decade and many surviving acts moved away from psychedelia into more back-to-basics "roots rock", the wider experimentation of progressive rock, or riff laden heavy rock.<ref name=Bogdanov2002Psych/>

In the late 1960s jazz rock emerged as a distinct sub-genre out of the blues rock, psychedelic and progressive rock scenes, mixing the power of rock with the musical complexity and improvisational elements of jazz. Many early US rock and roll musicians had begun in jazz and carried some of these elements into the new music. In Britain the sub-genre of blues rock, and many of its leading figures, like [[Ginger Baker]] and [[Jack Bruce]] of Cream, had emerged from the [[British jazz]] scene. Often highlighted as the first true jazz-rock recording is the only album by the relatively obscure New York-based [[The Free Spirits]] with ''Out of Sight and Sound'' (1966). The first group of bands to self-consciously use the label were R&B oriented white rock bands that made use of jazzy horn sections, like [[Electric Flag]], [[Blood, Sweat and Tears]] and [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], to become some of the most commercially successful acts of the later 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name=Bogdanov2002JazzRock/>

From the psychedelic rock and the Canterbury scenes came [[Soft Machine]], who, it has been suggested, produced one of the artistically successfully fusions of the two genres. Perhaps the most critically acclaimed fusion came from the jazz side of the equation, with [[Miles Davis]], particularly influenced by the work of Hendrix, incorporating rock instrumentation into his sound for the album ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' (1970). It was a major influence on subsequent rock-influenced jazz artists, including [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Chick Corea]] and [[Weather Report]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002JazzRock/> The genre began to fade in the late 1970s, as a mellower form of fusion began to take its audience,<ref name=AMJazzRock>{{Citation | last = | title =Jazz-rock | journal = Allmusic | url =http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/jazz-rock-d2776 | archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5wRb6iIh2 | archivedate =12 February 2011}}.</ref> but acts like [[Steely Dan]],<ref name=AMJazzRock/> Frank Zappa and [[Joni Mitchell]] recorded significant jazz-influenced albums in this period, and it has continued to be an major influence on rock music.<ref name=Bogdanov2002JazzRock>R.

The origins of glam rock are associated with [[Marc Bolan]], who had renamed his folk duo to [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] and taken up electric instruments by the end of the 1960s.

Punk rock was developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands eschewed the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock.<ref name=BogdanovPunk>J. Dougan, "Punk Music", in V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T.

Punk embraces a [[DIY ethic|DIY]] (do it yourself) ethic, with many bands self-producing their recordings and distributing them through informal channels.<ref>A.

By late 1976, acts such as the [[Ramones]] and [[Patti Smith]], in New York City, and the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[The Clash]], in London, were recognized as the vanguard of a new musical movement.<ref name=BogdanovPunk/> The following year saw punk rock spreading around the world. Punk quickly, though briefly, became a major cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom. For the most part, punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream. An associated [[punk subculture]] emerged, expressing youthful rebellion and characterized by distinctive [[Punk fashion|clothing styles]] and a variety of [[Punk ideologies|anti-authoritarian ideologies]].<ref>R.

By the beginning of the 1980s, faster, more aggressive styles such as hardcore and [[Oi!]] had become the predominant mode of punk rock.<ref>H. A.

If hardcore most directly pursued the stripped down aesthetic of punk, and New Wave came to represent its commercial wing, post-punk emerged in the later 1970s and early '80s as its more artistic and challenging side. Major influences beside punk bands were [[The Velvet Underground]], The Who, Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart, and the New York based [[no wave]] scene which placed an emphasis on performance, including bands such as [[James Chance and the Contortions]], [[DNA (band)|DNA]] and [[Sonic Youth]].<ref name="Bogdanov2002PostPunk">S.

Although many established bands continued to perform and record, heavy metal suffered a hiatus in the face of the punk movement in the mid-1970s. Part of the reaction saw the popularity of bands like Mot<U+00F6>rhead, who had adopted a punk sensibility, and Judas Priest, who created a stripped down sound, largely removing the remaining elements of blues music, from their 1978 album ''[[Stained Class]]''.<ref name=Bogdanov2002JudasPriest>S.

Inspired by NWOBHM and Van Halen's success, a metal scene began to develop in Southern California from the late 1970s, based on the clubs of L.A.'s [[Sunset Strip]] and including such bands as [[Quiet Riot]], [[Ratt]], [[M<U+00F6>tley Cr<U+00FC>e]], and [[W.A.S.P.

In the late 1980s metal fragmented into several subgenres, including [[thrash metal]], which developed in the US from the style known as [[speed metal]], under the influence of hardcore punk, with low-register guitar riffs typically overlaid by [[Shred guitar|shredding]] leads.<ref name=Bogdanov2002HeavyMetal>J.

American working-class oriented heartland rock, characterized by a straightforward musical style, and a concern with the lives of ordinary, [[blue collar]] American people, developed in the second half of the 1970s. The term heartland rock was first used to describe [[American Midwest|Midwestern]] [[arena rock]] groups like [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]], [[REO Speedwagon]] and Styx, but which came to be associated with a more socially concerned form of roots rock more directly influenced by folk, country and rock and roll.<ref>R.

Exemplified by the commercial success of singer songwriters [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Bob Seger]], and [[Tom Petty]], along with less widely known acts such as [[Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes]] and [[Joe Grushecky|Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers]], it was partly a reaction to post-industrial urban decline in the East and Mid-West, often dwelling on issues of social disintegration and isolation, beside a form of good-time rock and roll revivalism.<ref name=AllmusicHeartland/> The genre reached its commercial, artistic and influential peak in the mid-1980s, with Springsteen's ''[[Born in the USA]]'' (1984), topping the charts worldwide and spawning a series of top ten singles, together with the arrival of artists including [[John Mellencamp]], [[Steve Earle]] and more gentle singer/songwriters such as [[Bruce Hornsby]].<ref name=AllmusicHeartland/> It can also be heard as an influence on artists as diverse as [[Billy Joel]],<ref>{{Citation | last = J.

Heartland rock faded away as a recognized genre by the early 1990s, as rock music in general, and blue collar and white working class themes in particular, lost influence with younger audiences, and as heartland's artists turned to more personal works.<ref name=AllmusicHeartland/> Many heartland rock artists continue to record today with critical and commercial success, most notably Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty and John Mellencamp, although their works have become more personal and experimental and no longer fit easily into a single genre. Newer artists whose music would perhaps have been labelled heartland rock had it been released in the 1970s or 1980s, such as Missouri's [[The Bottle Rockets|Bottle Rockets]] and Illinois' [[Uncle Tupelo]], often find themselves labeled [[alt-country]].<ref>{{Citation | last =S.

The term alternative rock was coined in the early 1980s to describe rock artists who did not fit into the mainstream genres of the time. Bands dubbed "alternative" had no unified style, but were all seen as distinct from mainstream music. Alternative bands were linked by their collective debt to punk rock, through hardcore, New Wave or the post-punk movements.<ref name=Bogdanov2002USAlternative>S. T.

Few of these early bands, with the exceptions of R.E.M. and The Smiths, achieved mainstream success, but despite a lack of spectacular album sales, they exerted a considerable influence on the generation of musicians who came of age in the '80s and ended up breaking through to mainstream success in the 1990s. Styles of alternative rock in the U.S. during the 1980s included [[jangle pop]], associated with the early recordings of R.E.M., which incorporated the ringing guitars of mid-1960s pop and rock, and college rock, used to describe alternative bands that began in the college circuit and college radio, including acts such as [[10,000 Maniacs]] and [[The Feelies]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002USAlternative/> In the UK Gothic rock was dominant in the early 1980s, but by the end of the decade indie or dream pop<ref>{{Citation |title=Twee as Fuck: The Story of Indie Pop |first=|last=N.

In the early 2000s, a new group of bands that played a stripped down and back-to-basics version of guitar rock, emerged into the mainstream. They were variously characterised as part of a garage rock, post-punk or New Wave revival.<ref>{{Citation | last = H.

[[File:Woodstock redmond hair.JPG|thumb|left|The 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]] was seen as a celebration of the counter-cultural lifestyle.]]
The worldwide popularity of rock music meant that it became a major influence on culture, fashion and social attitudes. Different sub-genres of rock were adopted by, and became central to, the identity of a large number of [[sub-culture]]s. In the 1950s and 1960s, respectively, British youths adopted the [[Teddy Boys|Teddy Boy]] and [[Rocker (subculture)|Rockers]] subcultures, which revolved around US rock and roll<ref name="Brake; 1990; 73-9"/> The [[counter-culture]] of the 1960s was closely associated with psychedelic rock.<ref name="Brake; 1990; 73-9">M.

Gibson, ''Fashion Cultures: Theories, Explorations, and Analysis'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2000), ISBN 0-415-20685-5, p. 260.</ref> Paradoxically, followers of rock music have often mistrusted the world of fashion, which has been seen as elevating image above substance.<ref name="Bruzzi et al; 2000; 260"/> Rock fashions have been seen as combining elements of different cultures and periods, as well as expressing divergent views on sexuality and gender, and rock music in general has been noted and criticised for facilitating greater sexual freedom.<ref name="Bruzzi et al; 2000; 260"/><ref>G. Lipsitz, ''Time Passages: Collective Memory and American Popular Culture'' (Minneapolis MI: University of Minnesota Press, 2001), ISBN 0-8166-3881-0, p. 123.</ref> Rock has also been associated with various forms of drug use, including the [[stimulant]]s taken by some mods in the early to mid-1960s, through the LSD linked with psychedelic rock in the late 1960s and early 1970s; and sometimes to [[cannabis]], [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]], all of which have been eulogised in song.<ref>R.

Rock has been credited with changing attitudes to race by opening up [[African-American culture]] to white audiences; but at the same time, rock has been accused of appropriating and exploiting that culture.<ref>M. Fisher, ''Something in the Air: Radio, Rock, and the Revolution that Shaped a Generation'' (Marc Fisher, 2007), ISBN 0-375-50907-0, p. 53.</ref><ref>M. T. Bertrand, ''Race, Rock, and Elvis'' (Chicago IL: University of Illinois Press, 2000), ISBN 0-252-02586-5, pp. 95<U+2013>6.</ref> While rock music has absorbed many influences and introduced Western audiences to different musical traditions,<ref>J. Fairley, "The 'local' and 'global' in popular music" in in S. Frith, W. Straw and J. Street, eds, ''The Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), ISBN 0-521-55660-0, pp. 272<U+2013>89.</ref> the global spread of rock music has been interpreted as a form of [[cultural imperialism]].<ref>R. Shuker, ''Understanding Popular Music'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 1994), ISBN 0-415-10723-7, p. 44.</ref> Rock music inherited the folk tradition of [[protest song]], making political statements on subjects such as war, religion, poverty, civil rights, justice and the environment.<ref>T. E. Scheurer, ''American Popular Music: The Age of Rock'' (Madison, WI: Popular Press, 1989), ISBN 0-87972-468-4, pp. 119<U+2013>120.</ref> Political activism reached a mainstream peak with the "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" single (1984) and [[Live Aid]] concert for Ethiopia in 1985, which, while successfully raising awareness of world poverty and funds for aid, have also been criticised (along with similar events), for providing a stage for self-aggrandisement and increased profits for the rock stars involved.<ref>D. Horn and D. Bucley, "Distasters and accidents", in J. Shepherd, ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Media, Industry and Society'' (London: Continuum, 2003), ISBN 0-8264-6321-5, p. 209.</ref>

Since its early development rock music has been associated with rebellion against social and political norms, most obviously in early rock and roll's rejection of an adult-dominated culture, the counter-culture's rejection of consumerism and conformity and punk's rejection of all forms of social convention,<ref>P. Wicke, ''Rock Music: Culture, Aesthetics and Sociology'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2nd edn., 1995), ISBN 0-521-39914-9, pp. 91<U+2013>114.</ref> however, it can also be seen as providing a means of commercial exploitation of such ideas and of diverting youth away from political action.<ref>E. T. Yazicioglu and A. F. Firat, "Clocal rock festivals as mirrors into the futures of cultures", in R. W. Belk, ed., ''Consumer Culture Theory'' (Bingley: Emerald Group Publishing, 2007), ISBN 0-7623-1446-X, pp. 109<U+2013>114.</ref>
