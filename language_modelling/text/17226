===Music===
Maye sang in a tenor and falsetto. He recorded on over a dozen labels to include Modern, Tower, Specialty, ABC-Paramount, and Buddha.  In a Phil Milstein interview, Maye stated, <U+201C>I am the best singing athlete that ever lived. I am not bragging. It's just a fact.<U+201D> <ref>www.spectropop.com/ArthurLee Maye</ref>

==Early baseball and music careers==

Arthur Lee Maye<U+2019>s dual career began at Los Angeles, CA<U+2019>s Jefferson High school. Here he sang with [[Jesse Belvin]] and future members of the [[Platters]], [[Penguins]], [[Coasters]], and [[Medallions]].    Maye starred in baseball for both Jefferson High and local semi-pro teams.   Milwaukee Braves scout Johnny Moore not only saw his potential as a hitter with line drive power but clocked him in the 100-yeard dash at under 10-seconds. <ref>http:bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj</ref>.  Moore convinced the Braves to draft and sign him.  Arthur Lee Maye later explained, <U+201C>Baseball was my first love.  I could always sing at fifty, but I couldn<U+2019>t play baseball at fifty.<U+201D> <ref>www.spectropop.com/ArthurLee Maye</ref> He began his professional baseball career in 1954 with a Milwaukee Braves Pioneer League farm team in Boise, Idaho.  At this time he also started his professional recording career.  He joined [[Richard Berry]] and [[Jerry Coleman]] and recorded  <U+201C>The Fine One<U+201D>  b/w  <U+201C>Please Baby Please<U+201D> as the <U+201C>5<U+201D> Hearts on the Flair label (The company put the <U+201C>5<U+201D> in quotes as only three sang on the record).   They next released <U+201C>Sweet Thing b/w <U+201C>Rock Bottom<U+201D> under the name <U+201C>Rams.<U+201D>     Maye also sang the <U+201C>di-di-di<U+2019>s<U+201D> behind Richard Berry on the original <U+201C>[[Louie Louie]].<U+201D><ref>www.spectropop.com/ArthurLee Maye</ref>

==Minor League Baseball career and the Crowns==

Maye played for the Braves minor league teams in Boise, Eau Claire, Yakima, Evansville, Jacksonville, Wichita, Austin, and Louisville.   He also formed the musical group The Crowns.  The Crowns had back to back LA area hits on the Modern label with "Truly" and "Love Me Always."  On the Specialty label in 1956, they sang their best known record, "Gloria."  They also had an important 1956 record on the DIG label titled <U+201C>This is the Night for Love.<U+201D>   Maye said of his cross country stops, <U+201C>I'd watch all of them, any entertainer when I was in a town. You learn from each other. My stage presence wasn't polished, so I'd go to learn how to get my stage presence from the other top guys who did it for a living".   <ref>www.spectropop.com/ArthurLee Maye</ref >   In 1959 he batted .339 with 17 home runs for the Braves top Louisville farm team and broke into the Major Leagues.

==Major League Baseball career==

Maye hit over .300 in his first two seasons of Major League Baseball. <ref> www.baseball-reference.com/m/mayele01</ref>  A back injury and respiratory illness would slow his progress in 1962 and 1963.<ref>http:bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj</ref> In 1964, Maye hit .304, scored 96 runs, drove in 74 runs, and led National League in doubles with 44. In 1965, an ankle injury hurt his season and career.  He was traded to Houston's Astros and the Astrodome during the 1965 season.  He hit .288 with 9 home runs in 1966.   The Astros traded him to Cleveland before the 1967 season.  In 1968, Maye hit .281. <ref>http://www.baseball-reference.com/m/mayele01</ref> Maye was traded to the Washington Senators during the 1969 season.  He had personality issues with Manager [[Ted Williams]]<ref>spectropop.com/ArthurLeeMaye/index.htm</ref>  but respected his knowledge and hit .290. He played his final year in 1971 with the White Sox, hitting .205. <ref>www.baseball-reference.com/m/mayele</ref>   Lee Maye said, <U+201C>The greatest thrill is not getting to the major leagues. It<U+2019>s staying there.  I played 13 seasons when they had only 16 teams and I think that was a great accomplishment for me.<U+201D>  <ref>www.historicbaseball.com/players/m/maye_Lee </ref>

==Baseball and music conflict==
 
Arthur Lee Maye<U+2019>s baseball and music career often conflicted.  He sang under the name Arthur Lee Maye but played baseball under Lee Maye.  Another [[Lee May]] (Lee Andrew May) broke into [[Major League Baseball]] in 1965 and soon put up bigger home run and RBI numbers.<ref>www.baseball-reference.com/m/mayle01.shtml</ref>  Playing baseball fulltime created a time lag problem. Maye said, "When I was playing baseball all the requisite hours, I was a year behind in music, and I never got a chance to catch up with the music trend that I should have been with. I truly was behind the time, and I acknowledge that. Baseball and singing collided".<ref>spectropop.com/ArthurLeeMaye/index.htm<</ref>   He also acknowledged that baseball prevented his going on tour to promote his songs.  "When you're playing baseball and singing it's a very tough career for both of those", because you have to be at both places at the same time of the year, and you can't do that".<ref>spectropop.com/ArthurLeeMaye/index.htm</ref>

==Post baseball career==

Maye worked with [[Amtrak]] until his retirement.

==Music career revival==

In the mid 1980's, Maye returned to the recording studio with Dave Antrel and his Antrel Records, recording <U+201C>Moonlight<U+201D> b/w <U+201C>Happy and In Love.<U+201D>   <U+201C>Moonlight<U+201D> has been included on several compilation CDs, played a role in the novel '64 Intruder, and gets airplay on doo-wop radio programs.  Maye had a European tour planned when he became stricken with liver cancer.  The sponsor of Maye's page at Baseball-Reference.com called Maye  <U+201C>A truly classy Man<U+201D>.<ref>www.baseball-reference.com/m/mayele01.shtml</ref>
