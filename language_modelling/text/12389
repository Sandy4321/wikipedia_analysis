The '''Hudson Valley Rail Trail''' is a [[Road surface|paved]] {{convert|4|mi|km|adj=on}} east<U+2013>west [[rail trail]] in the [[Lloyd, New York|town of Lloyd]] in [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]], [[New York]], stretching from the [[Poughkeepsie Bridge]] through the [[Highland, Ulster County, New York|hamlet of Highland]]. The trail was originally part of the [[Poughkeepsie Bridge Route]], a rail [[Transport corridor|corridor]] that crossed the [[Hudson River]] via the Poughkeepsie Bridge. Controlled by a variety of railroads throughout the 19th&nbsp;and 20th&nbsp;centuries, the bridge was damaged and became unusable after a 1974 fire. By the 1980s the corridor's then-owner, [[Conrail]], had routed all rail traffic in the region [[Selkirk hurdle|north through Selkirk]], and was eager to relieve itself of the bridge and adjoining [[Right-of-way (transportation)|rights-of-way]]. In 1984, it sold the entire property for one dollar to a convicted felon who did not maintain it or pay taxes on it. The section of the corridor west of the Hudson was seized by Ulster County in 1991 and transferred to the town of Lloyd.

During the 1990s, a [[Broadband Internet access|broadband utility]] seeking to lay [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] cable paid the town to pass through the former corridor. The town used part of its payment to pave the route and open it as a public rail trail in 1997. The creation of the trail was supported by a local [[Rotary International|Rotary club]], which built a pavilion along the trail. The pavilion includes an antique [[caboose]], which was donated to the association which maintains the trail. While the trail originally ended at Route&nbsp;[[U.S. Route 44 in New York|44]]<U+2013>[[New York State Route 55|55]], it was extended eastward between 2009 and 2010, intersecting [[U.S. Route 9W|Route&nbsp;9W]] and continuing to the Poughkeepsie Bridge. The extension was paid for by [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|stimulus funding]].

The bridge, now a pedestrian walkway, connects the trail with the [[Dutchess Rail Trail]] to the east, creating a {{convert|30|mi|km|adj=on}} rail trail system that spans the Hudson. The trail is expected to be extended west, where it will border [[New York State Route 299|Route&nbsp;299]]. As it passes through Highland, the trail is carried by several bridges, connects to four parking areas, and traverses a [[Wetland|wetlands complex]].

The Hudson Valley Rail Trail is part of the former rail [[Transport corridor|corridor]] that comprised the [[Poughkeepsie Bridge Route]]. It ran east through the [[Highland, Ulster County, New York|hamlet of Highland]] in the [[Lloyd, New York|town of Lloyd]] over the [[Hudson River]] via the [[Poughkeepsie Bridge]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2003/07/13/top%20stories/9708023.txt |title=Troubled waters: Supporters of walkway over river can't agree on funding |date=2003-07-13 |accessdate=2011-01-10 |first=Hallie |last=Arnold |newspaper=[[Daily Freeman]] |location=Kingston, NY |publisher=[[Journal Register Company]]}}</ref> Highland has historically been Lloyd's largest population center.{{sfn|Sylvester|1880|p=128}} The corridor was, throughout its history, operated by the [[Central New England Railway|Central New England]], [[Reading Company|Philadelphia and Reading]],{{sfn|Adams|1996|p=213}} [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven]], [[Erie Railroad|Erie]], [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway|Ontario and Western]], [[Lehigh and New England Railroad|Lehigh and New England]] and [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]] railroads. Under the ownership of Penn Central, traffic along the bridge route was discouraged in favor of a [[Selkirk Subdivision|northern route]] through [[Selkirk, New York|Selkirk]]; the use of newer technology at the Selkirk [[Rail yard|yard]] to improve efficiency was cited as the primary reason.{{sfn|Mabee|2001|p=242}} At one point the Poughkeepsie corridor had been the primary thoroughfare for freight being shipped to [[New England]], and the New Haven yard at nearby [[Maybrook, New York|Maybrook]] was once "the largest railroad yard east of the [[Mississippi River]]". Rail traffic over the Poughkeepsie Bridge stopped entirely after the bridge was damaged in a 1974 fire.{{sfn|Penna|Sexton|2002|p=211}}

After Penn Central went bankrupt, [[Consolidated Rail Corporation|Conrail]] assumed control of the corridor, but opposed renovating it due to budgetary concerns.{{sfn|Mabee|2001|pp=252<U+2013>253}} Rail traffic up to the bridge continued until March 1982, when Conrail received permission from the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] to completely cease using the corridor; the tracks were removed the following year.{{sfn|Mabee|2001|p=255}} Donald L. Pevsner, a transportation lawyer from [[Florida]], secured a [[Right of first refusal|first-refusal option]] for purchasing the corridor to create restaurants and tourist attractions, but allowed it to expire on November&nbsp;1, 1984 because he could not secure financial backing;{{sfn|Mabee|2001|pp=261<U+2013>262}} he claims that Conrail expressed a desire to sell the corridor, at that point a [[Attractive nuisance doctrine|potential liability]], to the "first warm body" that would buy it.<ref>{{Cite interview |interviewer=Jason Schaaf |url=http://www.hudsonrivervalley.org/themes/pdfs/pevsnerdonald |last=Pevsner |first=Donald |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2011-01-12 |format=PDF |pages=3<U+2013>4 |title=Donald Pevsner: Worked on Bridge Preservation |program=[http://www.hudsonrivervalley.org/themes/walkwayhistory.html Walkway Over the Hudson Oral Histories] |callsign=[[Hudson River Valley Institute]] |quote=I said, 'how would you like to sell me the bridge for a dollar including the right of way between the shore and the New Paltz over pass of the Thruway, if I could find somebody that responsively with insurance, with maintenance, you know without having it become a dangerous derelict,' what we call in legal terms an attractive nuisance ...

In 1991, [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]] seized the right-of-way west of the Poughkeepsie Bridge and gave over {{convert|5|mi|km}} of the abandoned corridor to the town of Lloyd.{{sfn|Mabee|2001|p=264}}

Parcels of the right-of-way between Lloyd and the neighboring [[New Paltz, New York|town of New Paltz]] were sold off by the county shortly before ownership of the remaining corridor was transferred to Lloyd and converted to a [[rail trail]].{{sfn|Mabee|2001|p=264}}<ref name="rotary">{{Cite journal |url=http://www.hudsonvalleyrailtrail.net/downloads/hvrt_newsletter_fall_2009.pdf |title=Highland Rotary<U+2019>s Major Role In The Rail Trail |journal=Signals |publisher=Hudson Valley Rail Trail Association |location=Highland, NY |volume=6 |issue=3 |format=PDF |date=2009-08-11 |accessdate=2011-01-10 |page=3 |first=Rafael |last=D<U+00ED>az}}</ref> Roughly $400,000 in funding to convert the corridor to a trail was acquired through an [[easement]] between the town of Lloyd and a [[Broadband Internet access|broadband utility]] for the laying of [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] cable,<ref name="D<U+00ED>az">{{Cite journal |url=http://www.hudsonvalleyrailtrail.net/downloads/hvrt_newsletter_spring_2010.pdf |title=Eastward Expansion Is Ahead of Schedule |journal=Signals |publisher=Hudson Valley Rail Trail Association |location=Highland, NY |volume=7 |issue=2 |format=PDF |date=2010-05-21 |accessdate=2011-01-10 |page=3 |first=Rafael |last=D<U+00ED>az}}</ref> though only $70,000 was needed to [[Road surface|pave]] the trail.<ref name="rotary" /> The trail remains a right-of-way for the fiber optic line.{{sfn|Penna|Sexton|2002|p=211}} The development of the trail was supported by Highland's [[Rotary International|Rotary club]], which has since built several utilities for trail users, including a pavilion, garden and parking lot.<ref name="rotary" /> The corridor was officially opened as a trail in 1997.{{sfn|Mabee|2001|p=273}} Initially {{convert|2.5|to|3|mi|km}} long,<ref name="D<U+00ED>az" />{{sfn|Mabee|2001|p=273}} it stretched from Riverside Road in the west to Vineyard Avenue in the east; the removal of an [[overpass]] on Vineyard Avenue, as well as a blockage under a bridge on [[U.S. Route 9W]], prevented the trail from continuing east to the Poughkeepsie Bridge.{{sfn|Mabee|2001|p=273}}
