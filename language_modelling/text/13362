The '''''Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act''''' ("CCAA")<ref>{{Cite web|title = Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-36) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/index.html | accessdate = 2011-09-28}}</ref> is a statute of the [[Parliament of Canada]] that allows insolvent corporations owing their creditors in excess of $5 million to restructure their business and financial affairs. 

==Proceedings under the CCAA==
{{See also|Commercial insolvency in Canada}}

===Eligibility===
The scope of the CCAA is quite broad. It applies to any debtor company (or group of affiliated companies) that owes more than $5 million,<ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 3 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-2.html#h-3}}</ref> other than:
*banks
*insurance companies
*trust and loan companies
*railway and telegraph companies<ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 2, definition of "company" | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-1.html#h-2}}</ref>

and:
* is either bankrupt or insolvent
* has committed an act of bankruptcy under the  ''[[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]''("BIA") or is deemed insolvent under the ''Winding-Up and Restructuring Act''("WRA"), whether or not proceedings have been initiated under either of those Acts
* has made an assignment, or has been made subject to a bankruptcy order, under the BIA, or
* is being wound up under the WRA<ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 2, definition of "debtor company" | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-1.html#h-2}}</ref>

===Application to the court===
Any interested person may apply to the court for an order under the Act.<ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-5.html}}</ref> This is normally the debtor company, but a creditor can also do so.<ref>{{Cite web| author = Stephanie A.F. Grace |title = Creditor Initiated CCAA Proceedings | url = http://www.airdberlis.com/Templates/Articles/ArticleEdit.aspx?ArticleID=596&page=14 | publisher = [[Aird & Berlis]] | date = 2009-12-02 | accessdate = 2011-09-12}}</ref>The court having jurisdiction is the superior court for the province in which the company's head office or chief place of business in Canada, or, in the absence of that, where any of its assets are situated.<ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 9 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-4.html#h-4}}</ref>

===Powers of the court===
Where a compromise or arrangement has already been negotiated with the secured<ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 5 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-2.html#h-3}}</ref> or unsecured<ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 4 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-2.html#h-3}}</ref> creditors - essentially creating a [[pre-packaged insolvency]] - the court may summarily order that it proceed to be voted on by each class of creditors concerned, and, where necessary, by the shareholders as well. Whether a creditor is secured or unsecured is governed by the BIA.<ref>{{Cite web| author = Jackie Moher |title = SCC Holds No Priority for GST Claims in CCAA Proceedings | url = http://www.blakes.com/english/view_bulletin.asp?ID=4539 | publisher = [[Blake, Cassels & Graydon]] | date = 2011-02-02 | accessdate = 2011-09-28}}</ref>

Where no such compromise or arrangement has been negotiated, the court, on application, may issue an order, lasting for 30 days,
* staying,
* restraining from continuing, or
* prohibiting from commencing,
any proceedings against the debtor company, while negotiations are held to secure a compromise or arrangement with creditors and shareholders. The court may extend the protection for any period it sees fit.
<ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11.02 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-5.html}}</ref>

In addition, the court has broad discretion in administering any other issues that may arise.<ref>{{Cite web| author = John Sandrelli |title = Jurisdiction of the court in CCAA proceedings: Inherent jurisdiction vs statutory discretion | url = http://www.fmc-law.com/upload/en/publications/20052006/2634262_Jursidiction_of_the_Court_in_CCA.pdf | publisher = [[Fraser Milner Casgrain]] | date = 2005-09-15/16 | accessdate = 2011-09-12}}</ref> As the Act says,
{{cquote| ...the court, on the application of any person interested in the matter, may ... make any order that it considers appropriate in the circumstances.<ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-5.html}}</ref>|width=100%|cquote}}

In addition, the court may order
* the appointment of a monitor to report back on how the company's situation is progressing, and to advise the court appropriately<ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11.7 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-11.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 23 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-16.html#h-8}}</ref>
* the approval of arrangements similar to [[debtor-in-possession financing]] for sustaining the company's operations<ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11.4 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-9.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| author = Carole Hunter, Jonathan Levin and Edmund F.B.

* the coordination of its proceedings with corresponding foreign proceedings<ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, Part IV | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/FullText.html}}</ref>

===Debtor protection===
No person may terminate or amend <U+2014> or claim an accelerated payment or forfeiture of the term under <U+2014> any agreement, including a security agreement, with any debtor company subject to the CCAA by reason only that proceedings commenced under the CCAA or that the company is insolvent.<ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, s. 34(1) | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-20.html}}</ref>

Agreements can be assigned<ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 11.3 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-9.html}}</ref> or disclaimed<ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 32 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-19.html}}</ref> by the debtor company as a result of the proceeding, by following prescribed procedures.

===Approval of the compromise or arrangement===
Negotiated compromises and arrangements may deal with any matter, including claims against directors and amendments to the [[articles of incorporation]] or [[letters patent]] incorporating the company. When they have been approved by each participating class of creditors (by a two-thirds vote by value of the claims involved) the court may then approve it, and it will be binding on all persons, including trustees in bankruptcy.

They cannot be approved by the court if provision is not made for settling "super priority" claims (as they are known under the BIA) relating to:
* compensation and reimbursement claims by employees other than officers and directors
* pension plan contributions (except where agreement has been reached with the relevant pension regulator)
* source deductions due on employee withholdings<ref>{{Cite web|title = CCAA, S. 6 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-36/page-3.html}}</ref>

==Comparison of CCAA with other bankruptcy protection proceedings==

The CCAA has been described as being similar in nature to [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code | Chapter 11]] proceedings in the United States and to [[Administration (law) | administration proceedings]] and [[Insolvency Act 1986 | company voluntary arrangements]] ("CVAs") in the United Kingdom. Differences between the various proceedings include the following highlights:
