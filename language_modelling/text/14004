'''Leon<U+012B>ds Breik<U+0161>s''' was a noted 1930s [[Latvia]]n [[poet]], [[journalist]] and patriot.<ref name=Bisters/> His Latvian-based country style sits with contemporaries including [[Aleksandrs Pelecis]], [[J<U+0101>nis Medenis]], [[Gunars Freimanis]], [[Bronislava Martuzeva]] and [[Anda Lice]], who all suffered the terror of [[Bolsheviks]] in 1941.<ref name=LatPoet/><ref name=LatLit/><ref name=Lat20th/> He wrote the noted poems "Latvian's creed", "Prayer", and "Sacred Legacy", which became a noted nationalist song with music by Janis Norvilis.<ref name=Lat20th/> Having numerous poetry and political publications in his name in the 1930s, his third and last poetry collection was published posthumously, after his death in a [[Soviet]] [[gulag]] in [[Saratov]] in September 1942.<ref name=HolLat/>

==Early life==
Leondis Breikss was born on April 8, 1908, the second of five children born to Peteris and his wife Amalija.<ref name=Bisters/> The youngest four children were all born in [[Russia]], as Petris then was the steward of Prince [[Alexei Golytzin]]'s manor in [[Yelizarovo, Orekhovo-Zuyevsky District, Moscow Oblast|Yelizarovo]], then in [[Zaponorskaya Volost]] of [[Bogorodsky Uyezd]], part of the [[Moscow Governorate]].<ref name=Bisters/>

Peteris and his wife were originally from [[Vitini]], Latvia, where he had inherited his father Janis's house. Although the children were educated in Russian, at home their parents gave them a Latvian-based upbringing. The family were [[Lutheran]], but the nearest church was in Moscow, some {{convert|150|km}} away. So the family regularly attended the local [[Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church]], and for each of the three younger children born while in residence on his estate, Prince Golytzin paid for a Lutheran minister to make the journey from Moscow to [[baptise]] them.<ref name=Bisters/>

In summer 1913, during a local peasant uprising, the neighbouring manor was destroyed. After Peteris had ejected rioters from Prince Golytzin's manor, he sent his family to Moscow for safety. But during this time, those who did not speak the [[Russian language]] were considered [[German people|German]], and so Peteris waved good bye to his family as they departed on a train for [[Vecpiebalga]] to live with his relatives, travelling via [[Koknese]].<ref name=Bisters/> Aged 5, like his father Leondis attended the local school, and also fished the local [[River Ogre]]. The family often visited his mothers parents in [[Pakalniesi]], who were part of the local [[Hernhutian]] movement. From the 18th century onwards, and during the later-half of the 19th century, [[Piebalga]] district where the family now lived was home to many early Latvian nationalists, including the former house of linguist [[Atis Kronvalds]] and a monument to his acts of patriotism. The family also visited the home of local teacher and writer [[Matiss Kaudzite]], to whom the children would read [[Pushkin]].<ref name=Bisters/>

By Autumn 1913, Peteris had found employment as the manager's assistant in a textile factory in [[Serpuhovo]], so the family returned to Russia. They arrived in the middle of a [[scarlet fever]] epidemic, in which the eldest sister died. After the outbreak of [[World War I]], Peteris decided to move back to Moscow to keep his family safe, gaining the position as manager of the French manufacturer [[Girot]]'s silk factory. On September 8, 1915, youngest sister Tamara Anna was born, who after [[World War II]] brought Leonids poetry to the attention of the Latvian community in the [[United States]]. During the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], and following the abdication of [[Tsar Nikolai II]], food and fuel were in short supply under the [[Bolsheviks]]. Being now close to the post-revolutionary cauldron in Moscow, Peteris moved the family again to a [[Sovkhoz|state-farm (sovkhoz)]] close to [[Tula, Russia|Tula]].<ref name=Bisters/>

Following the end of WW1, the country of Latvia declared independence on November 18, 1918, which started the [[Latvian War of Independence]].<ref name=Lat20th/> After agreement of a truce on February 1, 1920, Russia and Latvia signed a peace treaty on August 11, formally recognised by the [[League of Nations]] on January 26, 1921.<ref name=Lat20th/> After the death of his younger sister (third child), the Brekiss family received a permit to leave Russia on October 3, 1920. Departing Moscow in a lorry convey in December 1920, the family of five leave Russia with only that which they can carry, travelling first to [[Zilupe]] and then catching a train to [[Riga]].<ref name=Bisters/>

==Early writing==
Having been mainly educated in Russian language, but also having knowledge of Latvian as well as the [[German language]], 12 year old Leonids found it hard to fully understand the [[Slavic language]] letters.<ref name=Bisters/> Educated privately at the Lutheran [[Marija Millere]] [[grammar school]], the family also attended the local Lutheran church, which had an [[altarpiece]] titled "Jesus blessing children" by [[Janis Rozent<U+0101>ls]].<ref name=Lat20th/>

Looking to express his isolation of living in his homeland while not being able to speak its language, Leonids starts to write expressively in Russian aged 13. Moving quickly to Latvian, his early writings are sorrowful expressions for his lost sisters, using the metaphor of lost birds trying to make their way home.<ref name=LatPoet/><ref name=LatLit/> Beginning to develop his style, he writes of religious-based principles of the wrongdoings to other people, as well as reflectively about the summer that he spent in Vitini. This also led to his writing of Latvian patriotism, expressed through both the history of Piebalga district and its early heroes.<ref name=LatPoet/><ref name=LatLit/> After trusting his mother and reading her some of his poetry, she sought the advice of theology professor Voldemars Maldonis of the [[University of Latvia]].<ref name=Bisters/><ref name=LatPoet/><ref name=LatLit/>

Aged 13, Leonids won his first prize for poetry from youth magazine ''Cirulitis'' (''Little Lark'').<ref name=LatPoet>{{cite book|title=Latvian Poetry|author=J. Burtnieks|publisher=A. Baumanis|year=1946}}</ref> The following year newspaper ''Kurzemnieks'' published his poem "On Christmas eve", published under his [[pen name]] of '''Sirijs'''.<ref name=LatPoet/><ref name=LatLit/> On April 13, 1924, his poem "I want to sing a song once" was published in newspaper ''Jaunatnes dzive'' (''Life of Youth''), later claimed to be his first commissioned publication.<ref name=Bisters/><ref>''Latvian literature in biography'' (1992, p. 58)</ref>

Continuing his studies at Riga State Grammar school No. 1, his fellow students include [[Arnolds Lusis]], latterly the [[archbishop]] of the Latvian Evangelical Lutheran church, who was exiled from 1966. [[Aleksandrs Dauge]], editor of magazine ''Latvju Jaunatne'' (''Latvian Youth''), began to feature his poems. Dauge also acts as a mentor, encouraging Leonids to develop his poetry using the natural wildlife and geography of Latvia to express his poetry. Leonids returns the compliment by featuring Dauge in his poetry during this period, which develops the basic artistic expressive theme of his poetry: sincere simplicity; the hymn-like patriotic; and religious disposition; united with a nature image.<ref name=Bisters/><ref name=LatPoet/><ref name=LatLit/>

After graduating in 1927 from the grammar school, with his father in a secure well-paying position with [[Latvian Railways]], in 1928 having spent the year writing, Leonids enrolled on a legal course at the University of Latvia. The following year he joined the student fraternity Fraternitas Latviensis, which helps develop his two loves: poetry, through its reading evenings; and politics, in which he starts writing on in published articles by criticising the speeches of the Latvia politicians.<ref name=Bisters/> On January 24, 1929, along with [[Alfred Valdmanis]] and [[Ilona Leimane]], Breikss joined the Council of the Academic section of the [[Latvian National Federation]], a right-wing nationalist party with strong antisemitic views, led by [[Arveds Bergs]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Alfred Valdmanis and the Politics of Survival |last=Bassler |first=Gerhard P. |year=2000 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto; Buffalo |isbn=0-8020-4413-1 |oclc=41347251|page=30 }}</ref>

At the time of his [[confirmation]] on [[Whitsunday]] of 1928 (an experience he would return to many times in his poetry), his parents had by this time moved to a farm in [[Lower Kurzeme]] near [[Auce]], situated next to [[Lake Kreklini]], an extension of [[Lake Ezerupe]]. It was from his time on the farm, walking through and picking apples from the orchard, that he wrote the poem "My motherland".<ref name=Bisters/><ref name=LatPoet/><ref name=LatLit/>

==Writer and journalist==
Encouraged by Bergs, Leonids left university having not graduated and was employed on the editorial board of newspaper ''Latvis''. His poetry was encouraged by both his employer and Bergs, a lawyer turned right-wing politician who worked in the press section of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, later shot in December 1940 in [[Orenburg]] prison.<ref>[http://www.am.gov.lv/data/Izstades/Diplomatija-un-maksla/07_05.jpg Ieraksts Latvijas diplom<U+0101>tisk<U+0101>s p<U+0101>rst<U+0101>vniec<U+012B>bas Lielbrit<U+0101>nij<U+0101> pasu re<U+0123>istr<U+0101>cijas <U+017E>urn<U+0101>l<U+0101> par pases Nr.191 izsnieg<U+0161>anu Arvedam Bergam (London<U+0101>, 1919. gada 2. j<U+016B>nij<U+0101>)]</ref><ref>Uldis Lasmanis.

In 1931, aged 23, [[Valters un Rapa]] [[publishing house]] publishes Leonids's first poetry collection ''Reverberant waters''. This is a collection of the best of all of his poetry so far created, and includes the hymn-like patriotic poem "A sacred legacy is this land to our nation", later put to music by [[Janis Norvilis]] as "Sacred Legend".<ref name=LatPoet/><ref name=LatLit>{{cite book|title=Latvian Literature|author=J<U+0101>nis Andrups & Vitauts Kalve|publisher=Goppers|year=1954}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Memento mori: a guide to contemporary memorial music|author=Robert Chase|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2007}}</ref>

In 1931, Leoinds had joined the right-wing and antisemitic political party [[Perkonkrusts]], led by [[Gustavs Celmi<U+0146><U+0161>]]. He left the party very publicly in 1933 in an article published in ''Latvis''. After this he became highly critical of the [[Saeima]], writing the article "Their time has arrived!" ("Vinu laiks ir klat!"), published by ''Universitas'' magazine just before the President dissolved the Saeima and outlawed Perkonkrusts in May 1934.<ref>''Universitas'', No. 5, 1933</ref> Both Leoinds and the publisher were unsuccessfully sued by the public prosecutors office, in the political aftermath of the parliaments dissolution.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Revue Canadienne Des <U+00C9>tudes Sur Le Nationalisme|volume=32|publisher=[[University of Prince Edward Island]]|page=89|year=2005}}</ref> After this he tempered his political articles, but believed in President [[Karlis Ulmanis]], who would later quote Leonids in various speeches.<ref>July 25, 1937, at Workers' Festival</ref><ref>''Sejejs'' (''Sower'') magazine, No. 4, 1939</ref><ref>March 18, 1939, exhibition "Work and leisure"</ref>

In 1933, his semi-autobiographic novel ''Will-o'-the-wisp'' was published, which covers his student life and early experiences of journalism.<ref name=LatPoet/><ref name=LatLit/> He then gathers this short stories together in the publication ''My dream land'', published by Gulbis in 1935, the same year in which his second collection of poems ''Our family'' was published, dedicated to his mother.<ref name=LatPoet/><ref name=LatLit/> Sections from this collection were read at the dedication ceremony of the [[Freedom Monument]] in 1934, which commemorates the Latvian War of Independence.<ref>{{cite book|title=Imagining the Nation: History, Modernity, and Revolution in Latvia|author=Daina Stukuls Eglitis|page=129}}</ref>

By 1934 Leonids was working in the Writing and Books section of the Ministry of Social Affairs, under painter and historian [[Ernests Braslins]], founder of the founder of the [[Dievturi]] congregation. During this time he wrote the poems "Christ" and "Prayer", in which he asks God for strength and resilience against evil.<ref name=LatPoet/><ref name=LatLit/> Still wanting to be a [[lawyer]], but with little time to study to complete his degree, his writing output from his green-inked typewriter increased, covering a vast array of topics but mainly around the areas of culture and religion. In 1936 Leonids served as editor and contributor to the multi-author short story collection ''Work songs''.<ref name=LatPoet/><ref name=LatLit/><ref>{{cite book|title=A century of Latvian poetry: an anthology|publisher=Calder|year=1957}}</ref>

==National service==
From 1937, Leonids served his two years of [[national service]] in the [[Latvian Army]]. After his basic training he was awarded the rank of corporal, but even while serving he continued to write, publishing over 30 pieces including "Latvian's prayer".<ref name=LatPoet/><ref name=LatLit/> Selected for officer training in Riga in 1939, he was joined there by Stanislavs Reinis, who would later fill-in the history of Leonids time in the army and during the two year course.<ref name=Bisters/>

In 1935, Leonids had met Anna Bildere (b. 1918, Riga). From 1939 their friendship developed, marrying at St. John<U+2019>s church, Riga on May 25, 1940. After a reception at the Latvian Railways headquarters, they honeymooned along the River Ogre close to Vecpiebalga. They returned to live in an apartment in Riga rented from [[bibliographer]] [[Janis Misins]], where within his extensive library the pair began to translate [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' into Latvian.<ref name=Bisters/>

==World War II==
{{see also|Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940}}
After the signing of the [[Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop Pact|Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop]] [[non-aggression pact]] on August 23, 1939, the [[Wehrmacht]] [[invasion of Poland]] began on September 1, 1939. After the Soviet-Japanese ceasefire agreement took effect on September 16, Stalin ordered his own invasion of Poland on September 17.{{Sfn|Goldman|2012|pp=163<U+2013>64}} This triggered Latvia and the USSR to sign a treaty in Moscow on October 6, 1939, to protect the USSR's south western border. This allowed the Soviets to invade part of south-eastern region of Finland ([[Karelia]] and [[Salla]]) in the [[Winter War]], which after 105 days were annexed.<ref name=Lat20th/>

After the death in March 1940 [[Edvarts Virza]], in an unstable Latvian political environment that was highly aware of the aggressive powers to both its east and west, Soviet forces began to enforce the secret parts of the Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop Pact on its neighbours, [[annexation|annexing]]: [[Estonia]]; [[Lithuania]],; [[Bessarabia]]; Northern [[Bukovina]]; and the [[Hertza region]]. On the 14/15 June 1940, [[Red Army]] unit invaded the Russian/Latvian [[Maslenki]] border point, allowing Soviet tank units to [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940|invade and occupy Riga on June 17]].<ref name=Lat20th>{{cite book|title=History of Latvia: the 20th century|author=Daina Bleiere|publisher=Jumava|year=2006}}</ref>

Dismissed by the Soviet occupation forces from his work at the Ministry of Social Affairs, as they formed the [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic (LPSR)]], Leonids and Anna like many Latvians began a life of hardship between occasional hard but low paying work. They initially worked in the repatriation of Baltic Germans to Germany, but after that worked manually in construction and farming.<ref name=Bisters/>

Leonids also continued writing, composing the poem "Latvian's creed" during this period and planning the publication of his third poetry book. But a public profile as a noted nationalist writer and political commentator was not useful at this time, with [[Cheka]] informants everywhere, and both the Latvian Police and Soviet secret police making regular night time raids on any perceived antagonists. Leonids was also listed in Unam's Latvian biographic dictionary "I know him", which served as a guide to the Soviet forces as to whom they should interrogate.<ref name=Lat20th/>

===Arrest===
After dismissing his mother's suggestion of fleeing Soviet occupation by travelling to Germany, the couple announce to their families at Leonids 33rd birthday party that they are expecting their first child. On April 17, 1941, just after midnight with his parents in residence at the couple's apartment in Riga, Leonids is arrested by a combined force of Cheka and Soviet-controlled [[State police]]. Only allowed to say goodbye to his pregnant wife, the State police then took Leonids away, while Cheka guards then ransacked the property and over the following 24 hours kept all occupants in standing positions, and interrogated all visitors.<ref name=Bisters/>

Over the following months, despite repeated attempts the family fail to confirm if the authorities hold Leoinds, let alone where he is or if he is still alive. In June 1941 the Cheka tell Leonids father that he has been arrested and convicted of "Anti-state activity according to article 58". After a number of visits to Riga Central Prison that all proved unfruitful, at midnight on June 14, 1941, the Cheka arrested Leonids' brother Peteris.<ref name=Bisters/>

On July 1, 1941, [[Occupation of Latvia by Nazi Germany|the Wehrmacht invaded Latvia]], entering Riga on the same day.<ref name=Lat20th/> While playing Leonids/Norvilis "Sacred Legacy", the last announcement from the radio presenter was: "''Dievs, sveti Latviju''" (God bless Latvia).<ref name=Lat20th/> Going to the now open prison, the family did not find Leonids among the 126 ordered shot dead prisoners of the fleeing Soviet forces.<ref name=Lat20th/>

To encourage pro-Nazi Germany feelings among the occupied Baltic states, and increase the locals hatred of the USSR, the German propaganda ministry encouraged the use and publishing of the works of both classical local writers and those missing from the time of the USSR's occupation.<ref name=Lat20th/><ref name=HolLat/> This resulted in Anna working with editor Anslavs Eglitis to compile Leoinds third poetry collection ''Songs for the earth and the sky'' with the full support of the occupying Nazi forces, published by [[Latvju Gramata]] in 1942.<ref name=LatPoet/><ref name=LatLit/> On June 15, 1943, under the watchful eye of the occupying Nazi forces, the Latvian people held a ceremony to commemorate the deported, which included a playing of Leonids/Norvilis "Sacred Legacy".<ref name=Lat20th/>

===Detention and death===
From surviving prisoners testimonies, much written and compiled by fellow prisoner Martins Bisters who was himself arrested on January 7, 1941, and did not return to Latvia until 1955; much is known of Leonid's detention but not his exact place or date of death.<ref name=Bisters>{{cite web|url=http://www.breikss.com/|title=Leonids Brekiss |publisher=Martins Bisters|date=January 12, 2014}}</ref>

Severely physically tortured in the Cheka building in Riga, the interrogation of Leonids was focused on members of the Latvian national resistance organization, specifically journalists: [[Edgars Samts]], [[Voldemars Krastins]], plus students Leonids Vezis and Atis Ansis Zalitis (all later shot at Astrakhan prison on November 28, 1941). During their investigation, the Cheka also arrested writers [[Anslavs Eglitis]] and [[Martins Zivers]] on May 27, 1941, in connection with their case against Leonids. All were eventually convicted based on paragraphs of article 58, which allowed convicts to be both harshly sentenced and deported. Transferred to Riga Central prison in May 1941, where on June 11 he signed a "Protocol on ceasing investigation". On June 20, 1941, Leonids was convicted based on the 58th paragraph by a Captain of the LPSR.<ref name=Bisters/>

On June 24, 1941, 3,150 Latvian prisoners including Leonids were driven in cattle wagons by road to [[Kryazh]] station.<ref name=Lat20th/><ref name=HolLat/> There, 900 were then shipped by boat down the [[River Volga]] to a former horse farm now converted into a gulag at [[Astrakhan]]; the rest of the Latvian's were shipped by train further into [[Siberia]].<ref name=Lat20th/><ref name=HolLat/> After a long march during which they were stoned by the local population, by late August 1941 Leonids was resident in the Astrakhan Khan Palace Prison, with his bunk mate Bisters. The two adjacent camps were run on starvation rations and full of disease, including [[dysentery]]. Along with the nationalists the Soviet guards shot there fellow Latvian intellectuals: [[Ernests Brastins]]; [[Aleksandrs Grins]]; [[Arveds Valtes Avots]]; [[Hugo Helmanis]]; [[Andrejs Kampis]]; [[Karlis Krauzis]]. By Autumn 1942, only 50 skeleton-like people remained, who were then transferred to fish processing plants around Astrakhan.<ref name=Bisters/><ref name=Lat20th/>

In September 1942, Leonids and Bisters were transferred by rail with Russian prisoners. As the Wehrmacht under ''[[Case Blue]]'' had broken through towards [[Stalingrad]], many prisoners were moved deeper and further north into Russia, towards the [[Arctic Circle]]. Transferred to a prison camp in [[Saratov]], during which Leonids was suffering from severe stomach pains, Bisters and Leonids were separated on arrival into a camp that was suffering from a [[typhoid]] epidemic.<ref name=Bisters/><ref name=Lat20th/> A few weeks later, Bisters was transferred to [[Krasnoyarsk]], where fellow Latvian detainee's said that when ordered to leave their cells in Saratov, Leonids body had simply laid strewn on the floor. Later unsupported testimoney suggests that Leonids may have been shot at Saratov, but his date and cause of death, plus his resting place remain to this day unknown.<ref name=Bisters/><ref name=Lat20th/><ref name=HolLat>{{cite book|title=The Holocaust in Latvia, 1941<U+2013>1944: the missing center|author=Andrew Ezergailis|publisher=Historical Institute of Latvia|year=1996}}</ref>

==Post war and legacy==
