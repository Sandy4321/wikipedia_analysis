'''Stop Climate Chaos Scotland''' (SCCS) is a coalition of organisations in Scotland that are campaigning on climate change, including trade and student unions, environmental and international development organisations, faith and community groups.  The coalition has close links with the Stop Climate Chaos coalition in London although it is a separately constituted organisation.

Stop Climate Chaos Scotland played a key role in the development of the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2009/12/contents Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009], the strongest climate change legislation in the world.  Stop Climate Chaos Scotland now works to ensure that the commitments set out in the Scottish Climate Change Act become a reality and that Scotland meets its targets to reduce emissions by 42% by 2020 and 80% by 2050.  As Scotland<U+2019>s own emissions account for only a relatively small percentage of the global total, SCCS is also working with civil society groups in other countries to promote the Scottish climate change example.
