The '''{{by|2005}} [[American League Division Series]]''' ('''ALDS'''), the opening round of the 2005 [[American League]] playoffs, began on Tuesday, October 4, and ended on Monday, October 10, with the champions of the three AL divisions<U+2014>along with a "wild card" team<U+2014>participating in two best-of-five series. They were:

*(1) [[Chicago White Sox]] (Central Division champion, 99<U+2013>63) vs. (4) [[Boston Red Sox]] (Wild Card, 95<U+2013>67): White Sox win series, 3<U+2013>0.
*(2) [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] (Western Division champion, 95<U+2013>67) vs. (3) [[New York Yankees]] (Eastern Division champion, 95<U+2013>67): Angels win series, 3<U+2013>2.

''The higher seed (#1 is the highest) had the home field advantage.''

'''''NOTE:''' The Yankees were designated the Eastern Division champions due to winning the season series 10<U+2013>9 against the Red Sox. The Angels received home field advantage rather than the Yankees due to their winning the season series 6<U+2013>4 against New York.''

2005 was the first year since [[2001 American League Division Series|2001]] that the [[Minnesota Twins]] had not participated in the ALDS. Other than the White Sox' victory in the AL Central, the participants were identical to those of the previous year.

The two victorious teams went on to meet in the [[2005 American League Championship Series|AL Championship Series]] (ALCS). The victorious White Sox advanced to defeat the [[2005 National League Championship Series|National League champion]] [[Houston Astros]] and win the [[2005 World Series]].

Little did the [[Red Sox]] know when starter [[Matt Clement]] hit [[Scott Podsednik]], the first batter he faced, that the rout was on.  But the young pitcher never regained his control and finished by allowing seven runs on eight hits, three of which were homers, in only {{frac|3|1|3}} innings.  The [[White Sox]] also scored in the third, fourth, sixth, and eighth innings.  The Red Sox were held to two runs by Jos<U+00E9> Contreras, who went {{frac|7|2|3}} innings, giving up just two [[earned runs]] on eight hits.  Four White Sox players hit home runs, including Podsednik, who had gone homerless in the regular season. It was his first home run since September 30, 2004.

Mark Buehrle gave up two runs in the first and two runs in the third inning and David Wells ({{frac|6|2|3}} innings, two earned runs, seven hits) looked tough, giving up only two hits in the first four innings.  But in the White Sox half of the fifth, the White Sox struck pay-dirt.  They scored five runs in the inning, three of which were [[unearned]], due to an error by Boston<U+2019>s [[Tony Graffanino]].  Buehrle (seven innings, four earned runs, eight hits) earned the win, with the save going to Bobby Jenks.

For the first time since 1993, the White Sox secure their place in the [[American League Championship Series|ALCS]] by beating the Red Sox in the third consecutive game.  The tough battle featured [[Freddy Garcia]] (five innings, five hits, three earned runs) and [[Tim Wakefield]] ({{frac|5|1|3}} innings, six hits, four runs).  Neither pitcher was very impressive, but both kept their team in the game.  The White Sox struck first, scoring two in the third with the Red Sox replying in the fourth.  In the sixth, [[Paul Konerko]], with [[Jermaine Dye]] on base, hit a home run to put the White Sox in the lead for good.  The Red Sox got one back in the bottom of the inning on a [[Manny Ram<U+00ED>rez]] monster [[homer]], but that was all they would get. [[Orlando Hern<U+00E1>ndez|El Duque, Orlando Hern<U+00E1>ndez]], came in to pitch with the bases loaded in the same inning with no outs.  He induced [[Jason Varitek]] to foul out, [[Tony Graffanino]] to pop out to short, and [[Johnny Damon]] to strike out to end the inning without giving up another run.  He proceeded to pitch three total innings, giving up one hit. [[Bobby Jenks]] came in to finish it, earning his second [[Save (baseball)|save]] of the series.

The Yankees were able to get to AL Cy Young Award winner, Bartolo Col<U+00F3>n early. With the bases loaded in the top of the first, rookie Robinson Can<U+00F3> lifted a line drive over the reaching hand of left fielder Garrett Anderson. The double would clear the bases, giving the Yankees a 3<U+2013>0 lead. Again in the second inning, the Yankees would score, this time on a single by Jason Giambi that scored Derek Jeter. Yankee pitching had lacked for most of the 2005 season, and starter Mike Mussina was injured for some of the year. But in Game 1, Mussina looked at his best. Mussina started out by keeping the Angels out of the run column for {{frac|5|2|3}} innings. Although the Angels scored another run in the ninth, Mariano Rivera shut the door and gave the Yankees a 1<U+2013>0 series lead.

In Game 2, the starters were [[John Lackey]] for the Angels and [[Chien-Ming Wang]] for the Yankees. The Yankees scored the first run of the game in the second when [[Robinson Can<U+00F3>]] doubled to left, allowing [[Hideki Matsui]] to come home. They made it 2<U+2013>0 in the fifth after [[Alex Rodr<U+00ED>guez]] walked and then moved to third on [[Jason Giambi]]'s double. Rodr<U+00ED>guez would score on [[Gary Sheffield]]'s ground out. The Angels got on the board in the bottom of that inning on [[Juan Rivera (baseball)|Juan Rivera]]'s [[home run]]. In the sixth, Alex Rodr<U+00ED>guez's [[error]] allowed [[Orlando Cabrera]] to make it to first base. He would move to second on [[Vladimir Guerrero]]'s ground out and score on [[Bengie Molina]]'s single, tying the game at two. In the next inning, Wang's throwing error would allow [[Jeff DaVanon]] and [[Steve Finley]] to score on Cabrera's single, giving the Angels a 4<U+2013>2 lead. In the eighth, Molina's home run extended the Angels lead to three. In the ninth, [[Jorge Posada]]'s homer cut the lead back the two, but the Angels still won the game to even the series.

In Game 3, it was [[Randy Johnson]] pitching for the Yankees while [[Paul Byrd]] pitched for the Angels. Johnson ran into trouble early, giving up a three-run homer to [[Garret Anderson]] in the first and a two-run homer to [[Bengie Molina]] in the third to give the Angels a 5<U+2013>0 lead. After allowing men on first and third with no outs in the fourth,  Johnson was taken out of the game right in front of an entire stadium of booing fans. The Yankees rallied in the bottom of the inning. First, [[Hideki Matsui]] homered to put the Yanks on the board 5<U+2013>1. Then [[Robinson Can<U+00F3>]] and [[Bernie Williams]] would single in. Can<U+00F3> scored on [[Jorge Posada]]'s ground out and Williams on [[Derek Jeter]]'s single. After [[Brendan Donnelly]] relieved Byrd, [[Jason Giambi]]'s single scored Jeter and cut the Angels' lead to one. In the next inning, after Matsui walked, Can<U+00F3> doubled to left and a throwing error by Cabrera allowed Matsui to score and Can<U+00F3> to remain to first base. [[Scot Shields]] relieved Donnelly. Shield gave up a sacrifice fly to [[Bernie Williams]] that scored Can<U+00F3>, giving the Yankees a 6<U+2013>5 lead, but that lead was short-lived. Reliever [[Aaron Small]] gave up two runs in the sixth to give the Angels the lead again. [[Tom Gordon]] allowed two unearned runs in the seventh and two earned runs in the eighth to give the Angels an 11<U+2013>6 lead. Jeter's home run in the bottom of the eighth made it 11<U+2013>7 Angels, but that was all the Yankees could muster up as the Angels won the game with that score and were only one win away from the [[2005 ALCS|ALCS]].

The Yankees cut the lead to one in the bottom of the inning when [[Alex Rodriguez]] scored on [[Gary Sheffield]]'s single off Angels starting pitcher [[John Lackey]]. In the bottom of the next inning, [[Robinson Can<U+00F3>]] singled and [[Jorge Posada]] walked. They would score on singles from [[Rub<U+00E9>n Sierra]] and [[Derek Jeter]].

Game 5 had the same starting pitchers as in Game 1, [[Bartolo Col<U+00F3>n]] for the Angels and [[Mike Mussina]] for the Yankees. Colon left the game in the second inning due to a hand injury and was relieved by [[Ervin Santana]]. He had a bad start, allowing walks to [[Robinson Can<U+00F3>]] (who was caught out stealing), [[Bernie Williams]], and [[Jorge Posada]]. Williams scored on [[Bubba Crosby]]'s single and Posada on [[Derek Jeter]]'s sacrifice fly as the Yankees took an early 2<U+2013>0 lead. Mussina, however, could not hold the Yankees' advantage and was not as sharp as he was in Game 1. First, he gave up a solo home run to [[Garret Anderson]] to cut the lead to one. Then, [[Bengie Molina]] singled to center. After getting two outs, Mussina walked [[Steve Finley]]. Then [[Adam Kennedy]] hit the ball to right center. It would have been an easy out, but [[Bubba Crosby]] and [[Gary Sheffield]] collide on the outfield wall, allowing Molina and Finley to score to give the Angels a 3<U+2013>2 lead. Mussina allowed two more runs in the third to extend to Angels lead to three. [[Randy Johnson]] relieved him and kept the Angels scoreless for the rest of the game, allowing just three hits. Jeter's solo home run in the seventh off Santana cut the lead to two, but it wouldn't be enough as the Angels won the game 5<U+2013>3 and would face the [[Chicago White Sox]] in the [[2005 American League Championship Series|ALCS]].
