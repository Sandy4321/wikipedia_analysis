==History==
Indian Books Centre was established by Lala Murari Lal Gupta Chharia in the early 1980s,  with his elder son Naresh Kumar Gupta. Another imprint, ''M/s. Divine Books'' was also founded in 1976 for publishing religious, philosophical and [[Ayurvedic]] books. After the demise of Lala-ji in 2010, the imprint was looked after by his grandson Varun Gupta under the guidance of Naresh & Sunil Gupta. 

A new Firm, ''M/s. Vasu Publications'' has also began to publish important works of Indological and [[Oriental studies]].

A new series in the name of Lala-ji, ''Lala Murari Lal Charia [[Oriental]] Series'' was started to pay homage to and enrich the memory of Lala-ji . The series publishes multi-volume Indological & Oriental works.
