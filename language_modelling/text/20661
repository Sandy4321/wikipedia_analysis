'''Andr<U+00E9>-Marie Amp<U+00E8>re''' ([[January 20]] [[1775]] &ndash; [[June 10]] [[1836]]), was a French [[physicist]] who is generally credited as one of the main discoverers of [[electromagnetism]]. The [[SI]] unit of measurement of [[Current (electricity)|electric current]], the [[ampere]], is named after him. 

==Early days==
Amp<U+00E8>re was born in [[Lyon]] (and lived from 1782 to 1797 in the nearby burg of [[Poleymieux-l<U+00E8>s-Monts-d'Or]]), and, as a [[child prodigy]], took a passionate delight in the pursuit of knowledge from his very infancy, and is reported to have worked out long arithmetical sums by means of pebbles and biscuit crumbs before he knew the figures. His father began to teach him [[Latin]], but ceased on discovering the boy's greater inclination and aptitude for mathematical studies. The young Amp<U+00E8>re, however, soon resumed his Latin lessons, to enable him to master the works of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli|Bernoulli]]. 

In later life he was accustomed to say that he knew as much about mathematics when he was eighteen as ever he knew; but, a [[polymath]], his reading embraced nearly the whole round of knowledge &mdash; history, travels, poetry, philosophy and the natural sciences.  

In [[1796]] he met Julie Carron, and an attachment sprang up between them. In [[1799]] they were married. From about 1796 Amp<U+00E8>re gave private lessons at Lyons in [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]] and languages; and in [[1801]] he removed to Bourg, as professor of [[physics]] and chemistry, leaving his ailing wife and infant son ([[Jean Jacques Amp<U+00E8>re]]) at Lyon. She died in 1804, and he never recovered from her death. In the same year he was appointed professor of mathematics at the ''[[lyc<U+00E9>e]]'' of Lyon.

==Contributions to physics and further studies==
[[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre]]'s recommendation obtained for him the Lyon appointment, and afterwards ([[1804]]) a subordinate position in the polytechnic school at Paris, where he was appointed professor of mathematics in 1809. Here he continued to pursue his scientific research and his diverse studies with unabated diligence.  He was admitted as a member of the Institute in [[1814]].  

Amp<U+00E8>re's fame mainly rests on the service that he rendered to science in establishing the relations between electricity and magnetism, and in developing the science of electromagnetism, or, as he called it, electrodynamics.  On [[September 11]], [[1820]] he heard of [[Hans Christian <U+00D8>rsted|H. C. <U+00D8>rsted's]] discovery that a magnetic needle is acted on by a voltaic current.  Only a week later, on [[September 18]], he presented a paper to the Academy containing a far more complete exposition of that and kindred phenomena.

==Legacy and final days==
The whole field thus opened up he explored with characteristic industry and care, and developed a mathematical theory which not only explained the electromagnetic phenomena already observed but also predicted many new ones.  

He died at [[Marseille]] and is buried in the [[Cimeti<U+00E8>re de Montmartre]], Paris. The great amiability and childlike simplicity of Amp<U+00E8>re's character are well brought out in his ''Journal et correspondence'' (Paris, [[1872]]). Forty-five years later, mathematicians recognised him.
