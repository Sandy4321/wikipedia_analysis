The '''raccoon''' (''Procyon lotor''), also known as the '''common raccoon''',<ref>Zeveloff, p. 42</ref> '''North American raccoon''',<ref>Zeveloff, p. 1</ref> '''northern raccoon'''<ref>{{cite journal | last=Larivi<U+00E8>re | first=Serge | year=2004 | title=Range expansion of raccoons in the Canadian prairies: review of hypotheses | journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin | volume=32 | issue=3 | pages=955<U+2013>963 | publisher=Allen Press | location=Lawrence, Kansas | issn = 0091-7648}}</ref> and [[Colloquialism|colloquially]] as '''coon''',<ref>Zeveloff, p. 2</ref> is a medium-sized [[mammal]] native to [[North America]]. As a result of escapes and deliberate [[introduced species|introductions]] in the mid-20th century, raccoons are now also distributed across the [[Europe]]an mainland, the [[Caucasus]] region and [[Japan]]. Their original [[habitat]]s are deciduous and [[mixed forest]]s, but due to their adaptability they have extended their range to mountainous areas, [[Salt marsh|coastal marshes]], and even [[urban areas]], where some home owners consider them to be [[Pest (organism)|pests]].

With a body length between 41 and 71&nbsp;cm (16.1<U+2013>28.0&nbsp;in) and a weight between 3.9 and 9.0&nbsp;kg (8.6<U+2013>19.8&nbsp;lb), the raccoon is the largest [[Procyonidae|procyonid]]. Two of its most distinctive characteristics besides its good memory are its [[Domino mask|facial mask]] and extremely sensitive front [[paw]]s. Both of these features are topics of the [[mythology]] of several [[Native Americans|Native American]] tribes. The diet of the [[Omnivore|omnivorous]] and usually [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] raccoon consists of about 40% [[invertebrates]], 33% [[plant]] foods and 27% [[vertebrates]]. Captive raccoons sometimes douse their food before eating it, which is most likely a [[vacuum activity]] imitating foraging at shores.

Thought to be loners in the past, there is now evidence that raccoons engage in gender-specific [[social behavior]]s. Related females often share a common area, while unrelated males live together in small groups up to four animals in order to maintain their positions against potential invaders, especially foreign males during the mating season. [[Home range]] sizes vary anywhere from 0.03&nbsp;km<U+00B2> for females in cities to 49.5&nbsp;km<U+00B2> for males in [[prairie]]s. After a gestation period of about 65 days, two to five young are born in spring, which are subsequently raised by their mother until dispersion in late fall. Although raccoons can get as old as 16 years, their average life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1 years. [[Hunting]] and traffic accidents are the two most common causes of death in many areas.

== Taxonomy ==
=== Nomenclature ===

[[Image:Raccoon (Procyon lotor) 2.jpg|thumb|Portrait]]

The word ''raccoon'' is derived from the [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]] word ''ahrah-koon-em''<U+2014>other transcripts exist<U+2014>which was the pronunciation used by Chief [[Powhatan]] and his daughter [[Pocahontas]] for the animal, meaning <U+201C>[the] one who rubs, scrubs and scratches with its hands<U+201D>.<ref>Holmgren, p. 23</ref> Similarly, [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonists]] adopted the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word {{lang|es|''mapache''}} from the [[Nahuatl]] word ''mapachitli'' of the [[Aztec]]s, meaning <U+201C>[the] one who takes everything in its hands<U+201D>.<ref>Holmgren, p. 52</ref> In many languages, the raccoon is named for its characteristic dousing behavior in conjunction with that language's term for ''bear'', for example {{lang|de|''Waschb<U+00E4>r''}} in [[German language|German]], {{lang|it|''orsetto lavatore''}} in [[Italian language|Italian]] and ''araiguma'' ({{lang|ja|<U+6D17><U+718A>}}) in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] abbreviation ''coon'' is used in words like ''coonskin'' for [[fur clothing]] and in phrases like ''old coon'' as a self-designation of [[trapper]]s.<ref>Holmgren, pp. 75<U+2013>76; Zeveloff, p. 2</ref>

In the first decades after its discovery by the members of the expedition of [[Christopher Columbus]], who was also the first person ever to leave a written record about the species, the raccoon was thought to be related to many different species by early [[taxonomist]]s, including dogs, cats, badgers and especially bears.<ref>Holmgren, pp. 42<U+2013>67</ref> One of them was [[Carolus Linnaeus]] who placed the raccoon in the genus ''[[Ursus]]'', first as ''Ursus cauda abrupta'' (<U+201C>long-tailed bear<U+201D>) in the second edition of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', then as ''Ursus Lotor'' (<U+201C>washer bear<U+201D>) in the tenth edition.<ref>Holmgren, pp. 64, 67; Zeveloff, p. 5</ref> In 1780, [[Gottlieb Conrad Christian Storr]] placed the raccoon in its own genus ''[[Procyon (genus)|Procyon]]'', which can be translated to mean either <U+201C>before the dog<U+201D> or <U+201C>doglike<U+201D>.<ref>Holmgren, p. 68; Zeveloff, p. 6</ref> It is also possible that Storr had its [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] lifestyle in mind and chose the star [[Procyon]] as eponym for the species.<ref>Hohmann, p. 44; Holmgren, p. 68</ref>

=== Evolution ===

Based on evidence from [[fossil]]s found in [[France]] and [[Germany]], the first known members of the family ''[[Procyonidae]]'' lived in Europe in the late [[Oligocene]] about 25&nbsp;[[mya (unit)|mya]].<ref>Zeveloff, p. 19</ref> Similar tooth and skull structures suggest that procyonids and [[Mustelidae|mustelids]] share a common ancestor, but molecular analysis speaks for a closer relationship between the raccoons and [[bear]]s.<ref>Zeveloff, pp. 16, 18, 26</ref> After crossing the [[Bering Strait]] at least six million years later, the center of the then existing species' distribution was probably located in [[Central America]].<ref>Zeveloff, pp. 20, 23</ref> [[Coati]]s (''Nasua'' and ''Nasuella'') and raccoons (''Procyon'') may have both descended from a species in the genus ''[[Paranasua]]'' between 5.2 and 6.0&nbsp;mya,<ref>Zeveloff, p. 24</ref> though this assumption, which is based on morphological comparisons of fossils, conflicts with a genetic analysis done in 2006 which suggests that raccoons are in fact more closely related to the [[Bassariscus|ringtails]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Koepfli | first=Klaus-Peter | coauthors=Gompper, Matthew E.; Eizirik, Eduardo; Ho, Cheuk-Chung; Linden, Leif; Maldonado, Jesus E.; Wayne, Robert K. | year=2007 | month=June | title=Phylogeny of the Procyonidae (Mammalia: Carnivora): Molecules, morphology and the Great American Interchange | journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume=43 | issue=3 | pages=1076<U+2013>1095 | publisher=Elsevier | location=Amsterdam | issn=1055-7903 | url=http://si-pddr.si.edu/dspace/bitstream/10088/6026/1/Koepfli_2007phylogeny_of_the_procy.pdf | format=[[PDF]] | accessdate=2008-08-10}}</ref> Unlike other procyonids, including the [[crab-eating raccoon]] (''Procyon cancrivorus''), the ancestors of the common raccoon left [[Tropics|tropical]] and [[Subtropics|subtropical]] areas and migrated farther north about 2.5&nbsp;mya, which has been confirmed by fossils found in the [[Great Plains]] and dating back to the middle of the [[Pliocene]].<ref>Hohmann, p. 46; Zeveloff, p. 24</ref>

=== Subspecies ===

After their discovery, the following five species of raccoon [[Endemism|found only]] on small [[Central America]]n and [[Caribbean]] islands were often regarded as distinct species: the small-toothed and light [[Cozumel raccoon]], the square-skulled and larger [[Tres Marias raccoon]], the very similar [[Bahaman raccoon|Bahamas]] and [[Guadeloupe raccoon]] and the [[Extinction|extinct]] [[Barbados raccoon]]. However, after studies of their morphological and genetic traits in 1999, 2003 and 2005, all but the Cozumel raccoon (''Procyon pygmaeus'') were listed as subspecies of the common raccoon in the third edition of [[Mammal Species of the World]] published in 2005.<ref>Zeveloff, pp. 42<U+2013>46</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last=Helgen | first=Kristofer M. | coauthors=Wilson, Don E. | year=2003 | month=January | title=Taxonomic status and conservation relevance of the raccoons (''Procyon'' spp.) of the West Indies | journal=Journal of Zoology | volume=259 | issue=1 | pages=69-76 | publisher=The Zoological Society of London | location=Oxford | issn=0952-8369}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Helgen | first=Kristofer M. | coauthors=Wilson, Don E. | editor=S<U+00E1>nchez-Cordero, V<U+00ED>ctor; Medell<U+00ED>n, Rodrigo A. | title=Contribuciones mastozool<U+00F3>gicas en homenaje a Bernardo Villa | url=http://books.google.de/books?id=PQphdAd9KKcC | accessdate=2008-08-09 | year=2005 | publisher=Instituto de Ecolog<U+00ED>a of the Universidad Nacional Aut<U+00F3>noma de M<U+00E9>xico | location=Mexico City | isbn=978-9703226030 | pages=230 | chapter=A Systematic and Zoogeographic Overview of the Raccoons of Mexico and Central America}}</ref><ref>{{MSW3 Wozencraft | pages=627<U+2013>628 | id=14001658}}</ref> Apart from these [[island raccoons]], most of the other 19 subspecies differ only slightly in coat color, size and other physical characteristics.<ref>MacClintock, p. 9; Zeveloff, pp. 79<U+2013>89</ref> However, several very small subspecies found along the southern coast of [[Florida]] and on the adjacent islands, such as the Ten Thousand Island raccoon (''Procyon lotor marinus''), are an exception to this rule.<ref>Zeveloff, pp. 82<U+2013>83</ref>

== Description ==
=== Physical characteristics ===

[[Image:Raccoon skull Pengo.jpg|thumb|Skull]]
[[Image:Mm Hand.jpg|thumb|Bottom side of the front paw]]
[[Image:Waschbaer fg01.jpg|thumb|Track]]

Head to hindquarters, raccoons measure between 41 and 71&nbsp;cm (16.1<U+2013>28.0&nbsp;in), not including their bushy [[tail]] which can measure between 19.2 and 40.5&nbsp;cm (7.6<U+2013>15.9&nbsp;in), but is usually not much longer than 25&nbsp;cm (9.8&nbsp;in).<ref>Hohmann, p. 77; Lagoni-Hansen, p. 15; Zeveloff, p. 58</ref> The shoulder height is between 22.8 and 30.4&nbsp;cm (9.0<U+2013>12.0&nbsp;in).<ref>Lagoni-Hansen, p. 16</ref> The body weight of an adult raccoon varies considerably with habitat and can range from 1.8 to 13.6&nbsp;kg (4.0<U+2013>30.0&nbsp;lb), but is usually between 3.9 and 9.0&nbsp;kg (8.6<U+2013>19.8&nbsp;lb).<ref>Zeveloff, pp. 58<U+2013>59</ref> The smallest speciemen are found in Southern Florida, while those near the northern limits of the raccoon's range tend to be the largest.<ref>Zeveloff, p. 59</ref> Usually, males are 15 to 20% heavier than females.<ref>Lagoni-Hansen, p. 18</ref> At the beginning of winter, a raccoon can weigh twice as much as in spring due to its fat storage.<ref>MacClintock, p. 44; Zeveloff, p. 108</ref> The heaviest recorded wild raccoon weighed 28.4&nbsp;kg (62.6&nbsp;lb), by far the largest size recorded for a procyonid.<ref>MacClintock, p. 8; Zeveloff, p. 59</ref>

The most characteristic physical feature of the raccoon is the area of black [[fur]] around the eyes which contrasts sharply with the surrounding white face coloring. This is reminiscent of a <U+201C>[[Domino mask|bandit's mask]]<U+201D> and has thus enhanced the animal's reputation for mischief.<ref>Zeveloff, p. 61</ref> The slightly rounded ears are also bordered by white fur. It is assumed that raccoons recognize the facial expression and posture of other members of their species more quickly due to the conspicuous facial coloration and the alternating light and dark rings on the tail. The dark mask may also reduce glare and thus enhance night vision.<ref>Hohmann, pp. 65<U+2013>66; MacClintock, pp. 5<U+2013>6; Zeveloff, p. 63</ref> On other parts of the body the long and stiff [[guard hair]]s, which shed moisture, are usually grayish.<ref name="z60">Zeveloff, p. 60</ref> Raccoons with a very dark coat are more common in the [[Germany|German]] population because individuals with such a coloring were among the ones being initially released to the wild.<ref name="stellungnahme">{{cite web | url=http://www.projekt-waschbaer.de/aktuelles/stellungnahme/ | title=<U+00D6>kologische und <U+00F6>konomische Bedeutung des Waschb<U+00E4>ren in Mitteleuropa <U+2013> Eine Stellungnahme | accessdate=2008-06-26 | last=Michler | first=Frank-Uwe | coauthors=K<U+00F6>hnemann, Berit A. | year=2008 | month=May | work=<U+201E>Projekt Waschb<U+00E4>r<U+201C> | language=German}}</ref> The dense [[underfur]], which accounts for almost 90% of the coat, insulates against cold weather and is composed of 2.0 to 3.0&nbsp;cm (0.8<U+2013>1.2&nbsp;in) long hairs.<ref name="z60" />

The raccoon, whose method of [[locomotion]] is usually considered to be [[plantigrade]], can sit on its hind legs to examine objects with its front [[paw]]s.<ref>Zeveloff, p. 71<U+2013>72</ref> As it has short legs compared to its compact torso, a raccoon is not able to run fast or to jump far.<ref>Hohmann, p. 93; Zeveloff, p. 72</ref> Raccoons can swim with an average speed of about 4.8&nbsp;km/h (3.0&nbsp;m/h) and are able to stay in the water for several hours.<ref>MacClintock, p. 33; Zeveloff, p. 72</ref> The [[dentition]]<U+2014>40 teeth with the dental formula 3142/3142<U+2014>is adapted to their [[Omnivore|omnivorous]] lifestyle: the [[carnassial]]s are not as sharp and pointed as those of a [[carnivore]], but the [[Molar (tooth)|molars]] are also not as wide as those of a [[herbivore]].<ref>Zeveloff, p. 64</ref> The [[penis bone]] of males is about 10&nbsp;cm (3.9&nbsp;in) long and strongly bent at the front end.<ref>MacClintock, p. 84</ref> Seven of the 13 identified vocal calls are used in communication between the mother and her kits, one of these being the birdlike twittering of newborn kits.<ref>Hohmann, p. 66; MacClintock, p. 92; Zeveloff, p. 73</ref>

=== Senses ===

The most important sense for the raccoon is its [[Somatosensory system|sense of touch]].<ref>Hohmann, p. 55; Zeveloff, p. 70</ref> The <U+201C>hyper sensitive<U+201D><ref>Hohmann, p. 55</ref> front paws with five freestanding [[finger]]s are surrounded by a thin layer of [[callus]] for protection. Almost two thirds of the area responsible for [[Perception|sensory perception]] in the [[cerebral cortex]] is specialised for the interpretation of tactile impulses, more than in any other studied animal.<ref>Hohmann, p. 56</ref> With their [[vibrissa]]e above their sharp, not retractable [[claw]]s, they are able to identify objects before touching them.<ref>Hohmann, p. 57; Zeveloff, p. 70</ref> It is not known why it has no negative effects to its tactile perception when a raccoon stands in cold water below 10<U+00B0>C for hours.<ref>Hohmann, pp. 60, 62</ref> However, the paws lack an opposable [[thumb]] and thus the agility of the [[hand]]s of [[primate]]s.<ref>Zeveloff, p. 70</ref>

The eyes of raccoons, which are thought to be [[Color blindness|color-blind]] or at least color-weak, are especially well-adapted for sensing green light.<ref>Hohmann, p. 63; MacClintock, p. 18; Zeveloff, p. 66</ref> Although they see well in twilight due to the [[tapetum lucidum]] behind the [[retina]] and their [[Accommodation (eye)|accommodation]] of 11 [[Dioptre]] is comparable to that of humans, [[visual perception]] is of subordinate importance to raccoons because of their poor long-distance vision.<ref>Hohmann, pp. 63, 65; MacClintock, pp. 18<U+2013>21; Zeveloff, pp. 66<U+2013>67</ref> In addition to being useful for orientation in the dark, their [[olfaction|sense of smell]] is important for intraspecific communication.<ref>Hohmann, p. 67</ref> Urine, feces, and glandular [[secretion]]s, usually distributed with their [[anal glands]], are used for marking.<ref>Hohmann, pp. 68<U+2013>70; MacClintock, p. 17; Zeveloff, pp. 68<U+2013>69</ref> With their broad [[hearing (sense)|sense of hearing]], they can perceive high tones up to 50<U+2013>85&nbsp;[[Hertz|kHz]] as well as very quiet noises like those produced by [[earthworm]]s underground.<ref>Hohmann, pp. 66, 72; Zeveloff, p. 68</ref>

=== Intelligence ===

Only a few studies have been undertaken to determine the mental abilities of raccoons, most of them based on their sense of touch. In a study by the [[Ethology|ethologist]] H. B. Davis in 1908, raccoons were able to open 11 of 13 complex locks in less than 10 tries and had no problems subsequently when the locks were rearranged or turned upside down. Davis concluded that they unterstood the abstract principles of the locking mechanisms and that their [[learning speed]] was equivalent to that of [[rhesus macaque]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Davis | first=H. B. | year=1907 | month=October | title=The Raccoon: A Study in Animal Intelligence | journal=The American Journal of Psychology | volume=18 | issue=4 | pages=447<U+2013>489 | publisher=University of Illinois Press | location=Champaign, Illinois}}</ref> Studies in 1963, 1973, 1975 and 1992 concentrated on their memory and have shown that raccoons can remember the solution to once learned tasks up to three years later. Gerti Dr<U+00FC>cker and B. Rensch showed in 1963, that raccoons are able to distinguish two 2.5&nbsp;cm (0.98&nbsp;in) and 2.64&nbsp;cm (1.04&nbsp;in) big orbs, placed inside a dark box, one year after the first test. In a study by B. Pohl in 1992, they instantly remembered the concept of equal and different symbols three years after the short initial learning phase.<ref>Hohmann, pp. 71<U+2013>72</ref> [[Stanislas Dehaene]] reports in his book ''The number sense'', that raccoons can distinguish boxes containing two or four grapes from those containing three.<ref>{{cite book | last= Dehaene | first= Stanislas | title= The number sense | year=1997 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York | isbn=0-19-511004-8 | pages=12}}</ref>

== Behavior ==
=== Social behavior ===

[[Image:Raccoons eat deer.png|thumb|Group eating]]

Studies done in the 1990s by the [[Ethology|ethologists]] Stanley D. Gehrt and [[Ulf Hohmann]] have indicated that raccoons show a gender-specific [[social behavior]] and are not typically loners as previously thought.<ref name="gehrt">Stanley D. Gehrt: ''Raccoon social organization in South Texas.'' 1994 (dissertation at the University of Missouri)</ref><ref>Hohmann, pp. 133<U+2013>155</ref> Related females often live in a so-called ''fusion-fission-society'', that is, they share a common area and occasionally meet at feeding grounds or sleeping places.<ref>Hohmann, pp. 141<U+2013>142</ref> Unrelated males often form loose ''male social groups'' to maintain their position against invaders, especially foreign males during the mating season.<ref>Hohmann, pp. 152<U+2013>154</ref> Such a group does not usually consist of more than four individuals.<ref>Hohmann, p. 140</ref> Since some males show aggressive behavior towards unrelated kits, mothers will isolate themselves from other raccoons until their kits are big enough to defend themselves.<ref>Hohmann, pp. 124<U+2013>126, 155</ref> In respect of these sharp differences between the social structures of raccoons, Hohmann called their society a ''three class society''.<ref>Hohmann, p. 133</ref> [[Zoology|Zoologist]] Samuel I. Zeveloff is more cautious in his interpretation and concludes that at least the females are solitary most of the time and, according to Erik K. Fritzell's study in [[North Dakota]] in 1978, males in areas with low population densities are as well.<ref>Zeveloff, pp. 137<U+2013>139</ref> Concerning the behavior patterns of raccoons, however, Gehrt points out that <U+201C>typically you'll find 10 to 15 percent that will do the opposite<U+201D>.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://chicagowildernessmag.org/issues/summer2002/raccoons.html | title=The City Raccoon and the Country Raccoon | accessdate=2008-07-28 | last=Riddell | first=Jill | year=2002 | work=Chicago Wilderness Magazine | publisher=Chicago Wilderness Magazine}}</ref> of what is expected.

Shape and sizes of [[home range]]s vary depending on gender and habitat, with adults claiming areas more than twice as large as juveniles.<ref>MacClintock, p. 61</ref> While the size of home ranges in the ill-suited habitat of North Dakota's [[prairie]]s lay between 6.7 and 49.5&nbsp;km<U+00B2> for males and between 2.3 and 16.3&nbsp;km<U+00B2> for females, the average size was 0.49&nbsp;km<U+00B2> in a [[marsh]] at [[Lake Erie]].<ref>MacClintock, pp. 60<U+2013>61</ref> Irrespective of whether the home ranges of adjacent groups overlap or not, they are most likely not actively defended outside the mating season and if food supplies are sufficient. It is assumed that odor marks on prominent spots serve the purpose of establishing home ranges and identifying individuals.<ref>Zeveloff, pp. 68<U+2013>69</ref> However, urine and feces left on shared latrines may provide additional information about feeding grounds, since it has been observed that raccoons meet there later for collective eating, sleeping and playing.<ref>Hohmann, pp. 142<U+2013>147</ref>.

=== Diet ===

[[Image:Mm im Apfelbaum.jpg|thumb|On an apple tree]]

Though usually nocturnal, raccoons are sometimes active at daylight to take advantage of available food sources.<ref>Zeveloff, p. 99</ref> Their diet consists of about 40% [[invertebrate]]s, 33% [[plant]] foods and 27% [[vertebrate]]s.<ref>Hohmann, p. 82</ref> Since its diet consists of such a variety of different foods, Zeveloff argues that the raccoon <U+201C>may well be one of the world's most [[Omnivore|omnivorous]] animals<U+201D>.<ref>Zeveloff, p. 102</ref> While their diet in spring and early summer consists mostly of [[insect]]s, [[worm]]s and other animals already available early in the year, raccoons prefer [[fruit]]s and [[Nut (fruit)|nut]]s that emerge in late summer and autumn for their rich calorie content in order to build up fat storages for winter.<ref>Hohmann, pp. 85<U+2013>86, 88; MacClintock, pp. 44<U+2013>45</ref> Contrary to popular belief, raccoons eat [[bird]]s and small [[mammal]]s only occasionally, since the demanding hunt to catch them usually does not pay off.<ref>Hohmann, p. 83</ref> Instead, [[fish]] and amphibians are their main vertebrate prey animals.<ref>Hohmann, p. 83</ref> When food is plentiful, raccoons can develop strong individual preferences for specific foods.<ref>MacClintock, p. 44</ref> In the northern parts of their range, raccoons go into a [[winter rest]], reducing their activity drastically as long as a permanent snow cover makes searching for food impossible.<ref>MacClintock, pp. 108<U+2013>113</ref>

[[Image:Procyon lotor 7 - am Wasser.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Captive raccoons often douse their food before eating.]]

=== Dousing ===

Raccoons sample food and other objects with their front paws in order to visualize them and to remove unwanted parts. In addition, it increases the tactile sensibility of their paws if this is done underwater, since the water softens the thin callus.<ref>Hohmann, p. 55; Zeveloff, p. 7</ref> However, the behavior of captive raccoons to carry their food to a watering hole to <U+201C>wash<U+201D>, or douse, it before eating, has not been observed in the wild.<ref>Lagoni-Hansen, p. 41; MacClintock, pp. 56<U+2013>57</ref> [[Natural history|Naturalist]] [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] (1707<U+2013>1788) believed that raccoons do not have adequate [[salivary gland]]s to moisten food, necessitating dousing, which is certainly incorrect.<ref>Holmgren, p. 70; Lagoni-Hansen, p. 41; MacClintock, p. 57; Zeveloff, p. 7</ref> Captive raccoons douse their food more frequently when a watering hole with a layout similar to a stream bottom is not farther than 3.0&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) away.<ref>MacClintock, p. 57</ref> The widely accepted theory is that dousing is a [[vacuum activity]] imitating foraging at shores for aquatic foods. This is supported by the observation that such foods are doused more frequently in the wild.<ref>Hohmann, pp. 44<U+2013>45; Lagoni-Hansen, pp. 41<U+2013>42; MacClintock, p. 57; Zeveloff, p. 7</ref> Cleaning dirty food does not seem to be an act of <U+201C>washing<U+201D>.<ref>MacClintock, p. 57</ref> Observations that even wild raccoons may dunk very dry food are doubted by other experts.<ref>Holmgren, p. 22 (pro); Lagoni-Hansen, p. 41 (contra)</ref>

=== Reproduction ===

[[Image:Common Raccoon (Procyon lotor) in Northwest Indiana.jpg|thumb|Kit (estimated eight weeks old)]]

Raccoons usually [[Mating|mate]] between late January and mid-March in a period triggered by increasing daylight.<ref>Hohmann, p. 150; MacClintock, p. 81; Zeveloff, p. 122</ref> However, there are large regional differences not completely explainable by solar conditions. For example, while raccoons in southern states typically mate later, the mating season in [[Manitoba]] also peaks relatively late, in this case in March, and may even occur as late as June.<ref>Zeveloff, p. 122</ref> During the mating period, the males restlessly roam their home ranges in search of females in an attempt to court them while they are in their three to four day long conception periods.

After roughly 63 to 65 days of [[gestation]] (though anwhere from 54 to 70 days is possible), a litter of typically two to five young is born.<ref>Hohmann, p. 131; Zeveloff, pp. 121, 126</ref> The average litter size varies strongly with habitat, ranging from 2.5 in [[Alabama]] to 4.8 in [[North Dakota]], for example.<ref>Lagoni-Hansen, p. 50; Zeveloff, p. 126</ref> Larger litter sizes are more common in areas with a high mortality rate, for example due to hunting or long, cold winters.<ref>Bartussek, p. 32; Zeveloff, p. 126</ref> While male yearlings usually reach their sexual maturity after the main mating season, female yearlings can compensate for high mortality rates as well and may be responsible for about 50% of all young born in some years.<ref>Hohmann, p. 163; MacClintock, p. 82; Zeveloff, pp. 123<U+2013>127</ref> Males have no part in raising young.<ref>MacClintock, p. 83</ref> The kits are blind and deaf at birth, though their mask already stands out on their light fur.<ref name="zp127">Zeveloff, p. 127</ref> The birth weight of the 9.5&nbsp;cm (3.7&nbsp;in) long kits is between 60 and 75&nbsp;g (2.1<U+2013>2.6&nbsp;oz).<ref name="zp127" /> They open their eyes for the first time after around 21 days.<ref name="zp127" /> Once the kits weigh about 1&nbsp;kg (2.2&nbsp;lb), they begin to explore outside of the den, consuming solid food for the first time after 6 to 9 weeks.<ref>Hohmann, p. 119; MacClintock, pp. 94<U+2013>95</ref> After this point, mothers lactate them with decreasing intensity, usually not longer than 16 weeks in total.<ref>Zeveloff, p. 129</ref> In fall, after their mother has shown them dens and feeding grounds, the juveniles split up.<ref>Hohmann, pp. 126<U+2013>127.

=== Life expectancy ===

Both captive and wild raccoons have been known to live up to 16 years. However, the species' life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1 years, depending on the local conditions in terms of traffic volume, hunting, and weather severity.<ref>Zeveloff, pp. 118<U+2013>119</ref> It is not unusual for only half of the young born in one year to survive until their first birthday.<ref>Hohmann, p. 163; Zeveloff, p. 119</ref> After this point, however, the yearly mortality rate drops to between 10 and 30%.<ref>Hohmann, p. 163</ref> One of the main causes of death for young raccoons besides losing their mother is [[starvation]] during the winter, especially if it is a cold and long one.<ref>MacClintock, p. 73</ref> The most frequent natural cause of death in North America is the disease called [[distemper]], which can reach [[epidemic]] proportions and kill most raccoons living in a given area (see section on [[Raccoon#Diseases|diseases]] below).<ref name="ergebnisse">{{cite web | url=http://www.projekt-waschbaer.de/erste-ergebnisse/ | title=Erste Ergebnisse | accessdate=2008-06-24 | last=Michler | first=Frank-Uwe | coauthors=K<U+00F6>hnemann, Berit A. | year=2008 | month=June | work=<U+201E>Projekt Waschb<U+00E4>r<U+201C> | language=German}}</ref> In areas with heavy traffic and extensive hunting, these factors can account for up to 90% of all deaths of adult raccoons.<ref>Hohmann, p. 162</ref> Predation by [[bobcat]]s, [[coyote]]s and other [[predators]] is not a significant cause of death, especially because larger predators have been exterminated in many areas inhabited by raccoons.<ref>Zeveloff, pp. 111<U+2013>112</ref>

== Range ==
=== Habitat ===

[[Image:Raccoon in bayou.jpg|thumb|Searching for food at a lakeshore]]

Although they have thrived in sparsely wooded areas in the last decades, raccoons depend on vertical structures to climb up when feeled threatened.<ref>Hohmann, pp. 93<U+2013>94; Zeveloff, p. 93</ref> Therefore, they avoid open terrain and areas with high concentrations [[Fagus|beech trees]] as their bark is too smooth to climb.<ref>Hohmann, p. 94</ref> [[Tree hollow]]s of old [[oak]]s or other trees and rock crevices are preferred by raccoons as sleeping, winter and litter dens. If such dens are unavailable or inconvenient to access, raccoons utilize [[burrow]]s dug by other mammals, dense [[undergrowth]], or tree crotches.<ref>Hohmann, pp. 97<U+2013>101; Zeveloff, pp. 95<U+2013>96</ref> In a study in the German low mountain range [[Solling]], more than 60% of all sleeping places were used only once, but those used at least 10&nbsp;times accounted for about 70% of all uses.<ref>Hohmann, p. 98</ref> Since amphibians, [[crustacean]]s and other animals found at the shore of lakes and rivers are an important part of their diet, bottomland [[deciduous]] or [[Mixed forests|mixed forests]] and [[marsh]]es sustain the highest population densities. While population densities range from 0.5 to 3.2 animals per square kilometer in prairies and do not usually exceed six animals per square kilometer in upland hardwood forests, more than 20 raccoons can live per square kilometer in bottomland forests and marshes.<ref>Hohmann, p. 160; Zeveloff, p. 97</ref>

=== Distribution in North America ===

Raccoons are common throughout North America from [[Canada]] south to [[Panama]], where the subspecies ''Procyon lotor pumilus'' coexists with the [[crab-eating raccoon]] (''Procyon cancrivorus'').<ref>Hohmann, pp. 12, 46; Zeveloff, pp. 75, 88</ref> The population on [[Hispaniola]] was exterminated by [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonists]], who hunted them for their meat, as early as 1513.<ref>Holmgren, p. 58</ref> Raccoons were also exterminated in [[Cuba]] and [[Jamaica]], where the last individuals were seen in 1687.<ref>Holmgren, pp. 58<U+2013>59</ref> The three island raccoon subspecies that have not been driven to extinction were classified as [[Endangered species|endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] in 1996 (see section on [[Raccoon#Subspecies|subspecies]]).<ref>{{IUCN2007 | assessors=Mustelid Specialist Group | year=1996 | id=18268 | title=Procyon insularis | downloaded=2008-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{IUCN2007 | assessors=Mustelid Specialist Group | year=1996 | id=18269 | title=Procyon maynardi | downloaded=2008-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{IUCN2007 | assessors=Mustelid Specialist Group | year=1996 | id=18270 | title=Procyon minor | downloaded=2008-08-10}}</ref>

There is evidence that raccoons were only numerous along rivers and in the woodlands of the [[Southeastern United States]] in pre-Columbian times.<ref>Zeveloff, pp. 77</ref> Their initial spread may have begun a few decades before the 20th century because raccoons were not mentioned in earlier reports of pioneers exploring the central and north-central parts of the United States.<ref>Zeveloff, pp. 78</ref> Since the 1950s, raccoons have expanded their range from [[Vancouver Island]] as their northernmost locale, as well as far into the north of the four south-central Canadian provinces.<ref>Zeveloff, p. 75</ref> Entirely new habitats that have recently become occupied by raccoons aside from urban areas include mountain ranges like the [[Western Rocky Mountains]], prairies, and [[Salt marsh|coastal marshes]].<ref>Zeveloff, p. 76</ref> After a population explosion starting in the 1940s, the estimated number of raccoons in North America in the late 1980s was 15 to 20 times higher than in the 1930s when raccoons were comparatively rare.<ref>Zeveloff, pp. 75<U+2013>76</ref> Urbanisation, the expansion of agriculture, deliberate introductions and the extermination of predators like wolves have probably caused this increase in abundance and distribution.<ref>Zeveloff, pp. 76<U+2013>78</ref>

=== Distribution outside North America ===

[[Image:Waschbaer-verbreitung.png|right|thumb|Distribution in Germany: Raccoons killed or found dead by hunters in the hunting years 2000/01, 01/02 and 02/03 in the administrative districts of Germany]] 

As a result of escapes and deliberate [[introduced species|introductions]] in the mid-20th century, the raccoon is now distributed in several European and Asian countries. Sightings have occurred in all bordering countries of Germany, which hosts the largest population outside of North America.<ref>Lagoni-Hansen, pp. 89<U+2013>90</ref> Another stable population exists in the north of [[France]] where several pet raccoons were released by members of the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] near the [[Laon-Couvron Air Base]] in 1966.<ref>Hohmann, p. 13</ref> 1243 animals were released in nine regions of the former [[Soviet Union]] between 1936 and 1958 with the intent of later hunting them for their fur. Two of these series of introduction were successful: the one in the south of [[Belarus]] between 1954 and 1958 and especially the one in [[Azerbaijan]] between 1941 and 1957. With an annual harvest of between 1,000 and 1,500 animals, it was estimated in 1974 that the size of the population distributed in the [[Caucasus]] region was around 20,000 animals and the density was four animals per km<U+00B2>.<ref>Lagoni-Hansen, pp. 90<U+2013>92</ref> In [[Japan]], up to 1,500 raccoons were imported as pets each year after the success of the [[anime]] series ''[[Rascal the Raccoon]]'' (1977). In 2004, the descendants of discarded or escaped animals lived in 42 of 47 [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20040916f1.html | title=Raccoons <U+2013> new foreign menace? | accessdate=2008-08-24 | last=Yoshida | first=Reiji | date=2004-09-16 | work=The Japan Times Online | publisher=The Japan Times Ltd.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080219a5.html | title=Raccoons take big bite out of crops | accessdate=2008-08-24 | date=2008-02-19 | work=The Japan Times Online | publisher=The Japan Times Ltd.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last=Ikeda  | first=Tohru | coauthors=Asano, Makoto; Matoba, Yohei, Abe, Go | year=2004 | title=Present Status of Invasive Alien Raccoon and its Impact in Japan | journal=Global Environmental Research | volume=8 | issue=2 | pages=125<U+2013>131 | publisher=Center for Global Environmental Research, National Institute for Environmental Studies | location=Tsukuba, Japan | issn=1343-8808 | url=http://www.airies.or.jp/publication/ger/pdf/08-02-03.pdf | format=[[PDF]] | accessdate=2008-09-07}}</ref>

==== Distribution in Germany ====

On [[April 12]] [[1934]], two pairs of raccoons were released into the German nature at the [[Edersee]] in the north of [[Hesse]] by forest superintendent Wilhelm Freiherr Sittich von Berlepsch upon request of their owner, the poultry farmer Rolf Haag.<ref>Hohmann, pp. 9<U+2013>10</ref> He released them two weeks before receiving permission from the [[Prussia]]n hunting office to <U+201C>enrich the [[fauna]]<U+201D>, as Haag's request stated.<ref>Hohmann, p. 10</ref> Several prior attempts to introduce raccoons in Germany were not successful.<ref>Hohmann, p. 11; Lagoni-Hansen, p. 84</ref> A second population originated in [[East Germany]] in 1945 when 25 raccoons escaped from a fur farm at Wolfshagen to the east of [[Berlin]] after an air strike. The two populations are parasitologically distinguishable: 70% of the raccoons of the Hessian population are infected with the [[roundworm]] ''[[Baylisascaris#Baylisascaris procyonis|Baylisascaris procyonis]]'', but none of the [[Brandenburg]]ian population.<ref>Hohmann, p. 182</ref> The estimated number of raccoons was 285 animals in 1956 and over 20,000 animals in 1970 in the Hessian region and between 200,000 and 400,000 animals in 2008 in the whole of Germany.<ref>Hohmann, p. 11</ref><ref name="ergebnisse" />

The raccoon was a protected species before being declared a [[Game (food)|game animal]] in 14 [[States of Germany|states]] since 1954.<ref>Hohmann, pp. 18, 21</ref> Hunters and [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]] argue that the raccoon spreads uncontrollably, threatening protected bird species and superseding domestic [[carnivore|carnivorans]].<ref name="stellungnahme" /> This view is opposed by the zoologist Frank-Uwe Michler who outlines that there is no evidence that a high population density of raccoons has negative effects to the general [[biodiversity]] of an area.<ref name="stellungnahme" /> Hohmann holds that extensive hunting can not be justified by the absence of natural predators, because predation is also not a significant cause of death in North America.<ref>Hohmann, pp. 14<U+2013>16</ref>

=== Urban raccoons ===

[[Image:Urban raccoon and skunk.JPG|thumb|A [[skunk]] and a raccoon share cat food morsels in a [[Hollywood]], [[California]], back yard.]]

Due to its adaptability, the raccoon has been able to use [[urban area]]s as a habitat. The first sightings occurred in a [[suburb]] of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], in the 1920s. Since the 1950s, raccoons have been present in [[metropolis]]es like [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Chicago]], and [[Toronto]].<ref name="untersuchungen">{{cite paper | first=Frank-Uwe | last=Michler | title=Untersuchungen zur Raumnutzung des Waschb<U+00E4>ren (''Procyon lotor, L. 1758) im urbanen Lebensraum am Beispiel der Stadt Kassel (Nordhessen) | pages=7 | date=2003-06-25 | url=http://www.projekt-waschbaer.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Diplomarbeit-Waschbaer-Michler.pdf | format=[[PDF]] | accessdate=2008-07-01}}</ref> Since the 1960s, [[Kassel]] has hosted Europe's first and densest population in a large urban area with about 50 to 150 animals per square kilometer (129<U+2013>388 animals per square mile), a figure comparable to those of urban habitats in North America.<ref>Hohmann, p. 108</ref><ref name="untersuchungen" /> Home range sizes of urban raccoons are only 0.03 to 0.38&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (0.01<U+2013>0.15&nbsp;mi<U+00B2>) for females and 0.08 to 0.79&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (0.03<U+2013>0.31&nbsp;mi<U+00B2>) for males.<ref name="Stand der Wissenschaft">{{cite web | url=http://www.projekt-waschbaer.de/stand-der-wissenschaft/ | title=Stand der Wissenschaft | accessdate=2008-07-01 | last=Michler | first=Frank-Uwe | coauthors=K<U+00F6>hnemann, Berit A. | work=<U+201E>Projekt Waschb<U+00E4>r<U+201C> | publisher=Gesellschaft f<U+00FC>r Wild<U+00F6>kologie und Naturschutz e.V. | language=German}}</ref> In small towns and suburbs, many raccoons sleep in a nearby forest after foraging in the settlement area.<ref>Bartussek, p. 20</ref><ref name="untersuchungen" /> Fruit and insects in gardens and leftovers in the garbage are easily available food sources.<ref>Bartussek, p. 21</ref> A large number of additional sleeping places also exist in these areas, such as hollows in old garden trees, cottages, garages, abandoned houses, and attics.

== Diseases ==

Raccoons can carry raccoon [[rabies]], a lethal disease caused by the [[Neurotropic virus|neurotropic]] rabies [[virus]] carried in the saliva and transmitted by bites.<ref>Zeveloff, p. 113</ref> Its spread began in Florida and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the 1950s and was facilitated by the introduction of infected individuals to [[Virginia]] and [[North Dakota]] in the late 1970s.<ref>Zeveloff, p. 113</ref> Of the 6,940 documented rabies cases reported in the United States in 2006, 2,615 (37.7%) were in raccoons.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Blanton | first=Jesse D. | coauthors=Hanlon, Cathleen A.; Rupprecht, Charles E. | date=2007-08-15 | title=Rabies surveillance in the United States during 2006 | journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association | volume=231 | issue=4 | pages=540<U+2013>556 | publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association | location=Schaumburg, Illinois | issn=0003-1488}}</ref> The [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]], as well as local authorities in several U.S. states and Canadian provinces, have developed oral [[vaccination]] programs to fight the spread of the disease in endangered populations.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/oral_rabies/index.shtml | title=National Rabies Management Program Overview | accessdate=2008-08-01 | date=2007-11-28 | work=Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service | publisher=United States Department of Agriculture}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://health.state.tn.us/FactSheets/raccoon.htm | title=Raccoons and Rabies | accessdate=2008-08-01 | date= | work=Tennessee.gov <U+2013> The Official Web Site of the State of Tennessee | publisher=Tennessee Department of Health}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.westislandchronicle.com/article-cp104472042-Quebec-uses-bait-to-vaccinate-raccoons-to-keep-rabies-out-of-Montreal.html | title=Quebec uses bait to vaccinate raccoons to keep rabies out of Montreal | accessdate=2008-08-01 | date=2008-05-17 | work=The Chronicle | publisher=Media Transcontinental}}</ref> Although raccoon rabies is as dangerous to humans as any other strain, only one fatal case has been reported.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Silverstein | first=M.

Unlike rabies and at least a dozen other pathogens carried by raccoons, [[distemper]], an [[epizootic]] virus, does not affect humans.<ref>MacClintock, p. 72; Zeveloff, p. 114</ref> This disease is the most frequent natural cause of death in North American raccoon populations and affects individuals of all age groups. For example, 94 of 145 raccoons died during one outbreak in Clifton, Ohio in 1968.<ref name="ergebnisse" /><ref>Zeveloff, p. 112</ref> It may occur conjoined with a following inflammation of the brain ([[encephalitis]]), causing together the same symptoms like rabies.<ref>Zeveloff, p. 113</ref> In Germany, the first eight cases of distemper were reported in 2007.<ref name="ergebnisse" /> Some of the most important [[Bacterium|bacterial]] diseases that affect raccoons are [[leptospirosis]], [[listeriosis]], [[tetanus]] and [[tularemia]]. Although internal [[parasite]]s weaken their [[immune system]], well-fed individuals can carry a great many roundworms in their digestive tract without showing symptoms.<ref>MacClintock, pp. 73<U+2013>74; Zeveloff, p. 114</ref> When cleaning latrines, a breathing protection should be worn to not ingest larvae of the ''Baylisascaris procyonis'' roundworm contained in the feces, since this parasite seldom causes a severe illness in humans.<ref>Hohmann, pp. 169, 182</ref>

In the [[mythology]] of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], the raccoon was often the subject of [[folk tale]]s.<ref>Holmgren, pp. 25<U+2013>46</ref> Stories like ''How raccoons catch so many [[crayfish]]'' from the [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] centered on its skills at foraging.<ref>Holmgren, pp. 41<U+2013>43</ref> In other tales, the raccoon played the role of the [[trickster]] who outsmarts other animals like coyotes and [[wolf|wolves]].<ref>Holmgren, pp. 26<U+2013>29, 38<U+2013>40</ref> Among others, the [[Dakota Sioux]] believed that the raccoon had [[spirit powers]] due to its mask which resembled the facial paintings used during [[ritual]]s.<ref>Holmgren, pp. 15<U+2013>17</ref> The [[Aztec]]s linked supernatural abilities especially to females.<ref>Holmgren, pp. 17<U+2013>18</ref>

In Western culture, several autobiographical novels about living with a raccoon exist, mostly written for [[Children's literature|children]]. The most well known is [[Sterling North]]'s ''[[Rascal (book)|Rascal]]'', in which he tells how he raised a kit during the [[World War I|First World War]]. In recent years, [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] raccoons played a main role in the animated television series ''[[The Raccoons]]'', the computer-animated film ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'' and the video game series ''[[Sly Cooper (series)|Sly Cooper]]''.

=== Hunting and fur trade ===

[[Image:Lanpher Furs Auto Coat Raccoon S71.jpg|thumb|upright|Automobile coat made out of raccoon fur (1906, U.S.)]]

The fur of raccoons is used for [[fur clothing]], especially for [[Coat (clothing)|coat]]s and the characteristic [[coonskin cap]]. [[Native American]] tribes not used the fur for winter clothing, but also used the tails as accessoires.<ref>Holmgren, p. 18</ref> In the 19th century, when coonskins occasionally even served as means of payment, several thousand raccoons were killed each year in the United States.<ref>Holmgren, p. 74; Zeveloff, p. 160</ref> This number rose quickly when automobile coats became popular after the turn of the century. In the 1920s, wearing a raccoon coat was regarded as [[status symbol]] among [[college student]]s.<ref>Holmgren, p. 77</ref> Attempts to breed raccoons in [[Fur farming|fur farms]] in the 1920s and 1930s in North America and Europe turned out not to be profitable and were given up after prices for long-haired pelts dropped in the 1940s.<ref>Zeveloff, p. 161</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Schmidt | first=Fritz | title=Das Buch von den Pelztieren und Pelzen | year=1970 | publisher=F. C. Mayer Verlag | location=Munich | language=German | pages=311<U+2013>315}}</ref> Although raccoons had become rare in the 1930s, at least 388,000 were killed during the hunting season of 1934/35.<ref>Holmgren, p. 77; Zeveloff, pp. 75, 160, 173</ref>

After persistent population increases began in the 1940s, the seasonal hunt reached about one million animals in 1946/47 and two million in 1962/63.<ref>Zeveloff, pp. 75, 160</ref> The broadcast of three television episodes about the [[Frontier#American_frontier|frontiersman]] [[Davy Crockett]] and the film ''[[Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier]]'' in 1954 and 1955 led to a high demand for coonskin caps in the United States.<ref>Zeveloff, p. 170</ref> Ironically, most likely neither Crockett nor the actor who plated him actually wore a cap made from raccoon fur.<ref>Zeveloff, p. 170</ref> The seasonal hunt reached an all-time high with 5.2 million animals in 1976/77 and ranged between 3.2 and 4.7&nbsp;million for most of the 1980s, before falling to 0.9 to 1.9&nbsp;million in the first half of the 1990s due to low pelt prices.<ref>Zeveloff, p. 160<U+2013>161</ref>

=== As food ===

While being primarily hunted for their fur, raccoons were also a source of food for many Native Americans, as well as for early [[American pioneer]]s.<ref>Holmgren, pp. 18<U+2013>19, Zeveloff, p. 165</ref> Today, several thousand raccoons are eaten each year in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ngpc.state.ne.us/wildlife/raccoon.asp | title=Raccoon | accessdate=2008-06-30 | work=Nebraska Wildife Species Guide | publisher=Nebraska Game and Parks Commission}}</ref> Its culinary use is mainly identified with certain regions of the [[American South]] like [[Arkansas]] where the ''Gillett Coon Supper'' is  an important political event.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/AR/200002687.html | title=Gillett Coon Supper | accessdate=2008-06-26 | last=Berry | first=Marion | work=Local Legacies: Celebrating Community Roots | publisher=The Library of Congress}}</ref> The first edition of ''[[The Joy of Cooking]]'', released in 1931, had a recipe for preparing raccoon. Recipes usually suggest removing the scent glands and fat before [[roasting]] in order to tone down the strong [[Game (food)|game]] flavor.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/martin/wildrecipes/infrac.php | title=Wild Game Recipes - Raccoon Information | accessdate=2008-06-26 | date=2006-02-17 | work=Martin County Center | publisher=NC State University}}</ref>

=== As pets ===

Raccoons are sometimes kept as [[pet]]s, though this is discouraged by many experts because the raccoon is not a [[domestication|domesticated]] species and may act unpredictably and aggressively.<ref>Bartussek, p. 44</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://fohn.net/raccoon-pictures-facts/pet-raccoons.html | title=Pet Raccoons? | accessdate=2008-06-22 | date=2005 | work=Raccoon Tracks}}</ref> Where keeping raccoons as pets is not forbidden, such as in Wisconsin and other U.S. states, an [[exotic pet]] permit may be required.<ref>MacClintock, p. 129</ref><ref>{{cite paper | last=Bluett | first=Robert | coauthors=Craven, Scott | title=The Raccoon (''Procyon lotor'') | pages=2 | publisher=Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System | date=1999 | url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/pdf/G3304.pdf | format=[[PDF]] | accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref> It is also possible for a pet raccoon to be taken by local authorities for a rabies test should it bite another person. However, raccoons acquired from a reputable [[breeder]] can make suitable pets if kept according to their needs by a responsible owner.<ref>MacClintock, p. 130</ref>

Sexually mature raccoons often show aggressive natural behaviors such as biting during mating season.<ref>Bartussek, p. 44; Hohmann, pp. 185<U+2013>186</ref> [[Neutering]] them at around five or six months of age decreases the chance of this happening.<ref>Hohmann, p. 186</ref> Raccoons can develop [[obesity]] and other disorders due to unnatural diet and lack of exercise.<ref>Hohmann, p. 185</ref> When fed with [[cat food]] over a long time period, as is often done, raccoons can develop [[gout]].<ref>Hohmann, p. 180</ref> Veterinarian Bernhard B<U+00F6>er argues that they should not be kept alone because they may grow lonely without contact with other raccoons.<ref>Hohmann, p. 184</ref> Since they will most likely wreak havoc in the household due to their natural curiosity, raccoons are usually kept in a [[Pen (enclosure)|pen]], which is required by law in some countries such as Germany.<ref>Bartussek, p. 44; Hohmann, pp. 184, 187; MacClintock, p. 130<U+2013>131</ref> <!-- Captive raccoons can be trained to be active during the day and sleep at night... I cannot find a reliable source for this statement made by another editor. --> It is usually impossible to teach raccoons to obey commands.<ref>Bartussek, p. 44</ref>

When orphaned, kits can be cared for and [[Reintroduction|reintroduced]] by a [[wildlife rehabilitation|wildlife rehabber]], though it is often uncertain whether or not they adapt well to life in the wild.<ref>MacClintock, p. 130</ref> Feeding kits, which still require a liquid food source, with [[cow milk]] instead of kitten replacement milk or similar products can be dangerous to their health.<ref>Bartussek, p. 44; Hohmann, pp. 175<U+2013>176</ref>
