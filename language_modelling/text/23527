'''Silverchair''' were an Australian [[alternative rock]] band.<ref name="McF">McFarlane, Encyclopedia entry for 'silverchair'</ref> The band formed as '''Innocent Criminals''' in Merewether, [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], New South Wales, Australia, in 1992, with their current lineup of vocalist and guitarist [[Daniel Johns]], bass guitarist [[Chris Joannou]], and drummer [[Ben Gillies]]. Silverchair has been highly successful in the Australian recording industry, receiving the industry's flagship awards, the [[ARIA Awards]], a record 21 times.<ref name=ARIAWins>{{cite web|url=http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history-by-artist.php?letter=S&artist=Silverchair |title=Winners by artist: Silverchair|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]|accessdate=4 February 2008}}</ref> The band has also received six [[APRA Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apra.com.au/awards/music/Nom08_SongOfYear.asp|title=APRA Music Awards <U+2013> 2008 Nominations|publisher=[[Australasian Performing Right Association]]|accessdate=19 June 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080615013632/http://www.apra.com.au/awards/music/Nom08_SongOfYear.asp |archivedate = 15 June 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref name="2008APRAAwards">{{Cite news|author=Cameron Adams|date=17 June 2008|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23875283-2902,00.html|title=Silverchair's Straight Lines wins top APRA award|work=Herald Sun |location=Australia|accessdate=19 June 2008}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref>

They got their big break in mid-1994 when they won a national demo competition conducted by SBS TV show <U+201C>Nomad<U+201D> and Triple J. The band was soon signed by [[Murmur (record label)|Murmur]], and were successful on the Australian and international rock stages. In 2003, following the release of ''[[Diorama (album)|Diorama]]'', the band announced a [[wikt:hiatus|hiatus]], during which time members recorded with side projects [[The Dissociatives]], [[The Mess Hall]], and [[Tambalane]]. Silverchair were reunited at the 2005 [[Wave Aid]] concerts, and went on to release ''[[Young Modern]]'' and play the [[Across the Great Divide tour]] with [[Powderfinger]].

Silverchair's sound has evolved throughout their career, differing sounds on specific albums steadily growing more ambitious over the years, from grunge on their debut to their more recent orchestral prog-infused chamber-pop. The songwriting and singing of Daniel Johns has been noted as improving steadily while the band has developed an increased element of complexity in later works.
Silverchair have sold in excess of six million records to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chairpage.com/news/item/33/|title=Silverchair  Signs with Eleven: Eleven signs with EMI|publisher=Silverchair|accessdate=12 September 2009}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Formation and early releases (1992<U+2013>1996) ===
In 1992, teenage singer/guitarist [[Daniel Johns]] and his school friend, drummer [[Ben Gillies]], started playing music together at their primary school. When they moved on to [[Newcastle High School (Australia)|Newcastle High School]], schoolmate [[Chris Joannou]] joined the pair on bass. They formed the band "Innocent Criminals" with second guitarist Tobin Finnane who soon left.<ref name="McF"/><ref name=AMGBio /> They played numerous shows around the [[Hunter Valley]] region in their early teens, as well as successfully participating in YouthRock in 1994, a competition for school-based bands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youthrock.com.au/html/history.html |title=Past performers|publisher=YouthRock|accessdate=3 February 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080422185727/http://www.youthrock.com.au/html/history.html |archivedate = 22 April 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Early in the year Innocent Criminals recorded demos of "Acid Rain", "Cicada", "Pure Massacre" and "Tomorrow" at Platinum Sound Studios.<ref name="McF"/>

The band's mainstream breakthrough came when they won a national competition in April called "Pick Me", conducted by the [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] TV show ''Nomad'' and alternative radio station [[Triple J]] with a demo of their original song "Tomorrow".<ref name="McF"/> As part of the prize, Triple J recorded the song and ABC filmed a [[music video|video]], aired on 16 June.<ref name="McF"/><ref name=AMGBio /> Innocent Criminals were then given the opportunity to change their name before the release of "Tomorrow" as a single. They were in fact forced to change their name due to trademark issues as the name "Innocent Criminals" was the name of an American Band. This was the primary reason for the change.

In an AT&T Blue Room interview in 2007 Silverchair discussed the actual origin of their band's name. They took the name from the C.S. Lewis book titled, "[[The Silver Chair]]". They admitted in the interview that they came up with what they thought was a good story, but realize now that it would have been much easier to just say it was from a book.

When the band changed its name from Innocent Criminals they had originally intended to be called 'Slitherchair'. After being mispronounced at a gig as Silverchair they decided to adopt that name.

Following a bidding war between rival labels, Silverchair signed a three-album recording contract with [[Sony Music]] subsidiary [[Murmur (record label)|Murmur Records]]; Sony A&R manager John Watson, who was jointly responsible for signing the group, subsequently left the label to become the group's manager. Their Triple J recording was released in August 1994 and the single spent six weeks at #1 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Singles Chart]].<ref name=AUSCharts>{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Silverchair |title=Silverchair Discography|publisher=australian-charts.com|accessdate=3 February 2008}}</ref> In 1995, a re-recorded version of "Tomorrow" (and a new video) was made for the US market, becoming the most played song on US modern rock radio that year.<ref name=AMGBio /> 

Silverchair<U+2019>s debut album, ''[[Frogstomp]]'', was recorded in just nine days, and released in 1995. At the time of recording, the band members were only 15&nbsp;years old, and still attending high school.<ref name=AMGBio /><ref name=RSFrog /> ''Frogstomp'''s lyrical concepts were fiction-based, drawing inspiration from television, hometown tragedies, and perceptions of the pain of friends. The album was well received; [[Allmusic]] and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated it in four and four-and-a-half stars respectively, praising the intensity of the album, especially "Tomorrow".<ref name=RSFrog /><ref name=AMGFrogstomp /> A #1 hit in Australia and New Zealand, ''Frogstomp'' went on to hit the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] Top 10, making Silverchair the first Australian band to do so since INXS. The album sold more than 2.5&nbsp;million copies worldwide.<ref name=AMGBio>Erlewine, Allmusic biography</ref> As ''Frogstomp'' and "Tomorrow" continued to gain popularity through that year, the group toured with [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and played on the roof of [[Radio City Music Hall]], while also continuing with their education in Newcastle that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amo.org.au/artist.asp?id=1626 |title=Artist :: Silverchair|publisher=[[Australian Music Online]]|accessdate=12 March 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080731052441/http://www.amo.org.au/artist.asp?id=1626 |archivedate = 31 July 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> 

In a January 1996 murder case, the defendant counsel for Brian Bassett, 16, and Nicholaus McDonald, 18, claimed that the pair listening to "[[Israel's Son]]", from ''Frogstomp'', caused the murder of Bassett's parents to take place. The band issued a statement that they did not condone or intend any such acts of violence, and the defense case was rejected.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Attorney wants to open teen's murder trial with rock song|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=18 January 1996}}<!-- http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64653616.html | http://www.silverchair.nu/sc_nu/faq/index.html#6C1 --></ref>

=== Critical and commercial success (1997<U+2013>2001) ===
While experiencing the success of ''Frogstomp'' in Australia and the United States, Silverchair began recording their second studio album, ''[[Freak Show (album)|Freak Show]]'', which they released in 1997. The album yielded three Top&nbsp;10 singles in Australia&nbsp;<U+2013> "[[Freak (Silverchair song)|Freak]]", "[[Abuse Me (Silverchair song)|Abuse Me]]", and "[[Cemetery (song)|Cemetery]]". The fourth single, "[[The Door (song)|The Door]]", reached #25.<ref name=AUSCharts /> The songs focused on the anger and backlash that the expectations of ''Frogstomp'' brought upon the band.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Freak Show Review|work=JUICE|author=Simon Wooldridge|date=February 1997}}</ref> ''Freak Show'' was certified gold in the United States,<ref name=USCertifs>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Silverchair&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |title=Gold and Platinum <U+2013> Silverchair|publisher=[[RIAA]]|accessdate=17 February 2008}}</ref> and global sales eventually exceeded 1.5&nbsp;million copies.<ref name=rage>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rage/guest/1999/silverchair.htm |title=Silverchair|publisher=[[abc.net.au]]|work=[[Rage (TV program)|Rage]]|date=4 September 1999|accessdate=18 March 2008}}</ref>

After graduating from school the band was able to spend much more time creating their next album, ''[[Neon Ballroom]]'', released in 1999. The band originally intended to take a 12-month-break, but in the end decided to devote their time to making music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/2000/daniel.htm |title=Daniel Johns of silverchair speaks to Richard Kingsmill|publisher=[[abc.net.au]]|work=[[Triple J]]|author=Richard Kingsmill|accessdate=4 February 2008|date=29 November 2000|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080608001909/http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/2000/daniel.htm |archivedate = 8 June 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> ''Neon Ballroom'' produced four singles; "[[Anthem for the Year 2000]]", "[[Ana's Song (Open Fire)]]", "[[Miss You Love]]", and "[[Paint Pastel Princess]]", three of which reached the top&nbsp;50 of the ARIA Charts.<ref name=AUSCharts />

Both ''Freak Show'' and ''Neon Ballroom'' topped the ARIA Albums Chart, making them the band's second and third, respectively, to do so.<ref name=MakeHistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/dig/stories/s1895177.htm |title=Silverchair Make Chart History|publisher=[[abc.net.au]]|work=DIG Radio|date=12 April 2007|accessdate=8 February 2008}}</ref> The albums charted well overseas; ''Freak Show'' reached #2 in Canada, and ''Neon Ballroom'' reached #5.<ref name=AMGCharts>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p144747|pure_url=yes}} |title=Silverchair > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=8 February 2008}}</ref> "Freak", "Abuse Me", and "Cemetery" all made the top&nbsp;10 in Australia,<ref name=AUSCharts /> and "Abuse Me" reached #4 on the [[Alternative Songs|Hot Modern Rock Tracks]] and [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] charts.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p144747|pure_url=yes}} |title=Silverchair > Charts & Awards > Billboard Singles|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=12 March 2008}}</ref> "Anthem for the Year 2000" was the highest charting single from ''Neon Ballroom'', at #3,<ref name=AUSCharts /> while "Ana's Song (Open Fire)" peaked at #12 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks, the fourth song Spawn Again is one of the band's most heavy and metal influenced song.<ref name=AMGCharts />

In 1999, Johns announced that he had developed an [[eating disorder]] due to anxiety. Johns noted that the lyrics to "Ana's Song (Open Fire)" dealt with his disorder, where he would "eat what he needed <U+2026> to stay awake."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/silverchair/articles/story/5921593/silverchair_frontman_reveals_battle_with_anorexia |title=Silverchair Frontman Reveals Battle with Anorexia|work=Rolling Stone |date=11 July 1999|accessdate=5 February 2008|author=Blair R. Fisher}}</ref> Johns later revealed that he had written ''Neon Ballroom'' while he was suffering from the disorder, and that he "hated music, really everything about it" at the time, but felt that he "couldn't stop doing it; I felt like a slave to it.".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/05/1086377186083.html |title=Anorexia almost killed me: Daniel Johns |work=Sydney Morning Herald |author=Christine Sams|date=6 June 2004|accessdate=5 February 2008}}</ref>

Silverchair toured extensively in support of ''Neon Ballroom'', propelling it to stronger worldwide sales than they had achieved with ''Freak Show''. ''Rolling Stone'''s Neva Chonin attributed the success to the album's more "mature" sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/silverchair/albums/album/91180/review/5943644/neon_ballroom |title=Silverchair: Neon Ballroom|work=Rolling Stone |author=Neva Chonin|date=18 March 1999|accessdate=5 February 2008}}</ref> In Europe and South America it became the group's most successful album to date, with Silverchair touring live and making appearances at festivals in [[Reading Festival|Reading]] and [[Edgefest]], amongst others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chairpage.com/press_releases/item/450/ |title=Reading Festival <U+2013> Reading, UK|publisher=Silverchair|accessdate=5 February 2008}}</ref> Silverchair's only live performance in 2000 was at the [[Falls Festival]] on New Year's Eve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chairpage.com/press_releases/item/228/ |title=Silverchair, The Falls Festival, Lorne, Victoria, 31/12/00|publisher=Silverchair|author=Les Thomas |work=Massive Magazine|accessdate=6 February 2008}}</ref> On 21 January 2001, the band played to 250,000 people at [[Rock In Rio]], a show they described as the highlight of their career.<ref name=Longway>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/longway/artist_index/silverchair.htm|publisher=[[abc.net.au]]|work=Long Way To The Top|title=Silverchair|accessdate=3 February 2008}}</ref> Following the tour, the band announced that they would be taking a 12-month-break.<ref name=Longway />

After the release of ''Neon Ballroom'', Silverchair's three album contract with Sony Music ended. The band were subsequently pursued by record labels during their hiatus. At the end of the break, they announced that they would be signing with  [[Atlantic Records]] for North and South America, as well as forming their own label, [[Eleven: A Music Company]], for Australia and Asia. After the announcement, Sony released ''[[The Best of Volume 1]]'' without the band's consent.<ref name=Longway />

=== ''Diorama'' (2001<U+2013>2002) ===
{{Listen|filename=Silverchair-LuvYourLive-25s.ogg|title="Luv Your Life"|description="Luv Your Life" was typical of Johns's new-found method of writing songs on piano, and also featured an orchestral arrangement by Van Dyke Parks.}}

In June 2001, Silverchair entered a studio in Sydney with producer [[David Bottrill]] ([[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[King Crimson]]) to start work on their fourth album, ''[[Diorama (album)|Diorama]]''.

=== Extended break and side projects (2003<U+2013>2005) ===
In 2000, while also working with Silverchair, Johns and [[Paul Mac]] released an internet-only [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''[[I Can't Believe It's Not Rock]]''.  After the announcement of Silverchair's hiatus, the pair re-united and formed [[The Dissociatives]], releasing a [[The Dissociatives (album)|self-titled album]] in 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/review/album/s1079132.htm |title=The Dissociatives|publisher=[[abc.net.au]]|work=[[Triple J]]|date=2 April 2004|accessdate=9 February 2008}}</ref> as well as providing the theme music for the popular [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC-TV]] music quiz show ''[[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]]'' (a reworking of [[The Bee Gees]]' 1966 [[Spicks and Specks (song)|hit]] of the same name).

After performing at Wave Aid, Silverchair reunited and began preparations for their next album. In 2006, ''[[Young Modern]]'' was demoed in the [[Hunter Valley]], and recorded at Los Angeles' Seedy Underbelly Studios with producer [[Nick Launay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigpondmusic.com/Album/Silverchair/Young-Modern.aspx |title=Young Modern|publisher=[[Bigpond Music]]|accessdate=18 March 2008}}</ref> [[Van Dyke Parks]] again worked with the band, who travelled to [[Prague]] to record with the [[Czech Philharmonic Orchestra]].<ref name=AmaYM>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Young-Modern-Silverchair/dp/B000NQR8AQ |title=Silverchair <U+2013> Young Modern|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=10 February 2008}}</ref> Silverchair produced the album independently, to ease the pressures faced previously when working with a record label.<ref name=AMGBio />

The band toured extensively before releasing the album, performing at [[Homebake]] and numerous other shows.

The album was released in 2007, as was the first single, "[[Straight Lines (song)|Straight Lines]]". "[[Reflections of a Sound]]", "[[If You Keep Losing Sleep]]", and "[[Mind Reader (song)|Mind Reader]]", were subsequently released.

According to Silverchair's website, as of 7 June 2009, Silverchair has begun work on the follow-up to ''Young Modern'', having spent three weeks recording in Australia with future sessions earmarked for the summer. No release date has been set, but the band uploaded in-studio videos working on several tracks to their official website.

On 3 December 2009 Daniel Johns called into [[Triple J]]'s Robbie, Marieke and The Doctor breakfast show and discussed Silverchair's new album which the band are currently working on in Newcastle. He told them "the main difference is there's a lot of experimentation with instruments and synths... I think there's only guitar on four songs out of fifty so far," but added the new material is "surprisingly rocky given there<U+2019>s no guitar."<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/media/s2760836.htm Triple J <U+2013> Robbie, Marieke and The Doctor show (audio interview) 3 December 2009]</ref>

In April, through a message on the band's official website, Chris Joannou announced that the band will perform two new songs called "16" and "Machina Collecta" at May's [[Groovin the Moo]] festival.[[File:Israels Son1.jpg|thumb|Silverchair performing in Bendigo May 2010]] The two songs looked likely to feature prominently on the new album but whilst he said work was progressing well, he confirmed there was, as yet no title for the upcoming album and that the band were simply referring to it as "Album #6".<ref>[http://www.chairpage.com/news/ Silverchair <U+2013> News 30 April 2010]</ref>

=== "Indefinite hibernation" ===
On 25 May 2011 the band announced through their LAS fan club that their career had come to a halt. The official website stated:

<blockquote>"We formed Silverchair nearly 20 years ago when we were just 12 years old. Today we stand by the same rules now as we did back then ... if the band stops being fun and if it's no longer fulfilling creatively, then we need to stop. [...] Despite our best efforts over the last year or so, it's become increasingly clear that the spark simply isn't there between the three of us at the moment. Therefore after much soul searching we wanted to let you know that we're putting Silverchair into "indefinite hibernation" and we've decided to each do our own thing for the foreseeable future."<ref>{{cite web|title=Chairpage News|url=http://chairpage.com/news/}}</ref></blockquote>

== Musical style ==
{{Listen|filename=Silverchair-Straight Lines (song)-25s.ogg|title="Straight Lines"|description="Straight Lines", ARIA's 2007 Song of the Year, was described as an "instant rock classic" by [[Allmusic]], with reviewer Clayton Bolger asserting ''Young Modern'' was drastically different to the straight-forward [[grunge]] on early albums, and the "few musical surprises" on ''Neon Ballroom'' and ''Diorama''.<ref name=AMGYM />}}

Silverchair are generally classified as an [[alternative rock]]/[[post-grunge]] band, although their loyalty to specific genres has changed as they have matured. Much of the band's early post-grunge work was inspired by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Alice in Chains]] and [[Black Sabbath]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/silverchair/articles/story/5925227/qa_daniel_johns |title=Quick Silverchair Messenger|work=Rolling Stone |date=27 December 1996|accessdate=18 March 2008}}</ref> Gillies agreed, noting the band were inspired by the "[[Seattle Sound]]", as well as [[The Beatles]] and [[The Doors]], and were highly impressionable in their youth.<ref name=Seattle>{{Cite news|title=Seattlest Interview: Silverchair Drummer Ben Gillies|work=Seattlest|author=Clint Brownlee|date=18 July 2007}}</ref> In their early years the perceived stylistic similarities led to Silverchair being derisively dubbed "Nirvana in Pyjamas" by the Australian media<ref>[http://www.howlspace.com.au/en2/silverchair/silverchair.htm Howlspace <U+2013> silverchair]</ref><ref>[http://www.hsc.csu.edu.au/society_culture/popular_culture/focus_studies/focus_grunge/pcgrunge.html HSC Online <U+2013> Grunge]</ref> (a sarcastic conflated reference to the band's youth and the popular Australian  children's TV series ''[[Bananas in Pyjamas]]'').

In writing ''Young Modern'', Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, in spite of a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was produced, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns has said he dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Daniel%20Johns%20of%20Silverchair/ |title=Interviews > Daniel Johns of Silverchair|publisher=SuicideGirls|author=Erin Broadley|date=16 August 2007|accessdate=16 February 2008}}</ref> Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expressnightout.com/content/2007/07/young_moderns_silverchair.php |title=Young Moderns: Silverchair|work=[[Express (newspaper)|Express]]|author=Tim Follos|date=24 July 2007|accessdate=3 October 2008}}</ref>

Joannou believed that ''Young Modern'' was simpler than ''Diorama'' but "still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements". He said that much of the success of him and the band resulted from Silverchair trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reaxmusic.com/articles/view/silverchair_interview_with_chris_joannou-426 |title=Silverchair: Interview with Chris Joannou|author=Stephanie Bolling|work=reax|accessdate=16 February 2008}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref>

Gillies notes that Silverchair will often "run the risk of losing fans" in their work,<ref name=Seattle /> and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in ''Diorama'' and ''Young Modern''.<ref name=Seattle /> However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact "that we haven<U+2019>t been pigeonholed, and people really don<U+2019>t know what to expect" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band "appreciate what we<U+2019>ve achieved and what we<U+2019>ve got" in their careers.<ref name=Seattle />

=== Reception ===
''Frogstomp'' was described as similar to Nirvana and Pearl Jam; [[Allmusic]]'s Stephen Thomas Erlewine noting it followed in "the alternative rock tradition" of the bands.<ref name=AMGFrogstomp /> The band's songwriting was poor at that stage, with Erlewine stating that "their songwriting abilities aren't as strong" as those of their peers.<ref name=AMGFrogstomp>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r218511|pure_url=yes}} |title=Frogstomp > Overview|publisher=Allmusic|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|accessdate=13 February 2008}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' however, claimed that the band had risen above their peers, applauding Johns' "ragged vocals".<ref name=RSFrog>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/silverchair/albums/album/129990/review/5941363/frogstomp |title=Silverchair: Frogstomp|work=Rolling Stone |date=2 February 1998|accessdate=13 February 2008}}</ref> ''Freak Show'' saw the band show more of their own musical style, rather than copying others,<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r246793|pure_url=yes}} |title=Freak Show > Overview|publisher=Allmusic|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|accessdate=13 February 2008}}</ref> and thus received more praise for its songwriting than its predecessor. [[Yahoo! Music]]'s Sandy Masuo described the lyrics as "moving" and "emotional".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/review/12062572 |title=Freak Show|publisher=[[Yahoo! Music]]|author=Sandy Masuo |date=12 April 1997|accessdate=13 February 2008}}</ref>

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' approved of the further advancement in ''Neon Ballroom'', commenting on "plush strings on these adult arrangements".<ref name=EW /> There were once again significant advancements in songwriting; Johns was described as "furious, motivated, and all grown up".<ref name=EW>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,274828,00.html |title=Neon Ballroom {{!}} Music Review|work=Entertainment Weekly |author=Tom Lanham|date=19 March 1999|accessdate=13 February 2008}}</ref> However, ''Rolling Stone'' said the album seemed confused, commenting that Silverchair "can't decide what they want to do" with their music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/silverchair/albums/album/91180/review/5943644/neon_ballroom |title=Silverchair: Neon Ballroom|work=Rolling Stone |author=Neva Chonin|date=18 March 1999|accessdate=13 February 2008}}</ref> Meanwhile, ''Diorama'' was seen as an extension of the band's originality, with its "[h]eavy orchestration, unpredictable melodic shifts and a whimsical pop sensibility".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/silverchair/albums/album/201588/review/5944466/diorama |title=Silverchair: Diorama|work=Rolling Stone |author=[[Mark Kemp]]|date=8 August 2002|accessdate=13 February 2008}}</ref> According to [[PopMatters]]' Nikki Tranter, the album stood out in an otherwise dull Australian music market.<ref name=PopMattersDiorama>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/s/silverchair-diorama.shtml |title=Silverchair: Diorama|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|author=Nikki Tranter|date=6 September 2002|accessdate=13 February 2008}}</ref>

Allmusic's Clayton Bolger described ''Young Modern'' as an improvement by the band, praising "catchy melodic hooks, inspired lyrical themes, and stunning string arrangements". He claimed the album was the pinnacle of the band's development.<ref name=AMGYM>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1041337|pure_url=yes}} |title=Young Modern > Review|publisher=Allmusic|author=Clayton Bolger|accessdate=13 February 2008}}</ref> PopMatters' Nick Pearson saw the opposite, claiming that "[o]nce you reach the level of intellectual maturity where you can tell the difference between cryptic but poetic lyrics and nonsensical crap, you have outgrown Silverchair".<ref name=PMYM /> Pearson called the album an attempt to secure a safer territory and assure sales, after the success of past works, calling it more boring than its predecessors.<ref name=PMYM>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/music/reviews/33751/silverchair-young-modern/ |title=Silverchair: Young Modern|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|author=Nick Pearson|date=22 May 2007|accessdate=13 February 2008}}</ref> Other reviewers noted influences from cult British band [[XTC]].<ref>{{cite web|author=&#8212;John Everson |url=http://www.popstops.net/silverchair5.htm |title=Foo Fighters, Silverchair, Sound the Alarm <U+2014> Pop Stops for8/2/07 by John Everson |publisher=Popstops.net |date=2007-08-02 |accessdate=2011-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/7446253/a/Young+Modern.htm |title=Silverchair - Young Modern CD Album |publisher=Cduniverse.com |date=2007-07-24 |accessdate=2011-07-14}}</ref>
