'''''Cats''''' is a [[Musical theatre|musical]] composed by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] based on ''[[Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats]]'' by [[T. S. Eliot]].  It introduced the standard '[[Memory (song)|Memory]]'.

The show first opened in London in 1981 and then on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1982.  It won numerous awards, including both the [[Laurence Olivier Award]] and the [[Tony Award]] for Best Musical.  The London production ran for 21 years, and the Broadway production for eighteen years, in both cases setting historical long-run records.  It has been performed around the world in numerous productions and has been translated into more than 20 languages.  ''Cats'' was also made into a [[Cats (film)|1998 video]] that has been broadcast on television.  Actresses [[Elaine Paige]] and [[Betty Buckley]] became particularly associated with the musical.

==Production history==
''Cats'' was first shown in [[London]]'s [[West End theatre|West End]], at the [[New London Theatre]], on May 11, 1981. It had a troubled beginning as [[Judi Dench]], cast in the role of [[Grizabella]], snapped a tendon during rehearsals prior to the London opening.  The role of Grizabella was subsequently taken over by [[Elaine Paige]]; the role was beefed up for Paige and the song '[[Memory (song)|Memory]]' (originally to be sung by Geraldine Gardner in the role of the red cat Bombalurina) was given to Paige. It was originally produced onstage by [[Cameron Mackintosh]] and Lloyd Webber's [[Really Useful Group]]. It was directed by [[Trevor Nunn]], associate director and choreographer [[Gillian Lynne]], designed by [[John Napier (designer)|John Napier]] with lighting by [[David Hersey]]. It played a total of 8,949 performances in London. Its final performance in London's West End was on its 21st birthday, May 11, 2002, and broadcast on a large screen in [[Covent Garden]] to the delight of fans who could not acquire a ticket for the final performance. It held the record as London's longest running musical until October 8, 2006, when it was surpassed by [[Les Mis<U+00E9>rables (musical)|Les Mis<U+00E9>rables]].

[[Image:CatsOriginalLondonCast.jpg|thumb|left|275px|The original 1981 London cast of ''Cats''.]]The show made its debut on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on October 7 1982, at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] with the same production team. On June 19 1997, ''Cats'' became the [[List of the 100 Longest-Running Broadway shows|longest-running musical]] in Broadway history with 6,138 performances. It played a total of 7,485 performances in New York. Its New York record was surpassed on January 9 2006, by ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', which was also composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber. ''Cats''' final performance on Broadway was on 10 September 2000.

In 1998, [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] produced a video version<ref name=briefhistory>{{cite web

It was directed by [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]], with choreography and musical staging by the show's respected original creator [[Gillian Lynne]] in London's [[Adelphi Theatre]], and was released on VHS and DVD, as well as broadcast on Television worldwide.

==Detailed synopsis==
===Act One&nbsp;<U+2014> When Cats are Maddened by the Midnight Dance===
[[Image:CatsGroup.jpg|thumb|right|Cast of the video version of ''Cats''.]]
After the overture, the cats gather on stage and explain the [[Jellicle]] tribe and their purpose ('Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats'). The cats spot the human audience and explain how the different cats of the tribe are named ('The Naming of Cats'). This is followed by a dance from Victoria the White Cat that signals the beginning of the Jellicle Ball and Munkustrap tells us that tonight is the night when Old Deuteronomy will choose a cat to be reborn into a new life on the Heaviside Layer.

[[Munkustrap]] appears and introduces [[Jennyanydots]] ('The Old Gumbie Cat'), a large tabby cat. She "sits and sits and sits" all day, while at night she rules over the mice and cockroaches, teaching various activities to them. Jennyanydots finishes, greets the other cats, but is interrupted. The music instantly changes, and The [[Rum Tum Tugger]] makes an extravagant entrance ('The Rum Tum Tugger'). The Rum Tum Tugger is a tom with a wild mane and leopard spots on his chest. He is very fickle and unappeasable, "for he will do as he do do and there's no doing anything about it".

A shabby old grey cat stumbles out and looks around. It is [[Grizabella]]. All the cats back away. The cats sing of her saddened, unfortunate state ('Grizabella: The Glamour Cat'). Grizabella leaves and the music changes to a cheerful upbeat. [[Bustopher Jones]], a fat cat in "a coat of fastidious black", appears ('Bustopher Jones: The Cat About Town'). Bustopher Jones is among the elite of the cats, and visits prestigious [[gentleman's club]]s.  A loud crash startles the tribe.  Could this be [[Macavity]]?  The cats run off the stage in fright. Hushed giggling signals the entrance of [[Mungojerrie]] and [[Rumpleteazer]], a pair of near-identical cats. They are petty burglars, very mischievous, and enjoy causing trouble for human families ('Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer').

Finally, the Jellicle patriarch, [[Old Deuteronomy]], shows up ('Old Deuteronomy'). He is a large old cat that <U+201C>has lived many lives<U+201D> and <U+201C>buried nine wives (And more, I am tempted to say <U+2013> ninety-nine)<U+201D>. He is the one who will choose which Jellicle cat will go to the [[Heaviside Layer]].  In most productions, at this point, the cats perform a song ('The Awefull Battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles') for Old Deuteronomy. It is a story about two dog tribes clashing in the street and subsequently being scared away by the Great [[Rumpus Cat]]. After a few words from Old Deuteronomy on the destiny of Jellicle Cats and Pollicle Dogs, a second loud crash, presumably from Macavity, sends the alarmed cats scurrying. But Old Deuteronomy calls them back and the main celebration begins ('The Jellicle Ball'), in which the cats sing, dance and display their "terpsichorean powers".

After the Ball, Grizabella reappears, refusing to be left out of the festivities. Once again, she is shunned by the other cats, but that does not stop her from singing a short version of '[[Memory (song)|Memory]]'.

===Act Two&nbsp;<U+2014> Why Will the Summer Day Delay&nbsp;<U+2014> When Will Time Flow Away?===
After the Jellicle Ball, Old Deuteronomy sings of <U+201C>what happiness is<U+201D> ('The Moments of Happiness'). Gus&nbsp;<U+2014> short for Asparagus&nbsp;<U+2014> shuffles forward ('Gus: The Theatre Cat'). He is the cat that once was a famous actor but now he is old and <U+201C>suffers from palsy which makes his paws shake<U+201D>. He is accompanied by [[Jellylorum]], who tells of his exploits. Gus then remembers how he once played the infamous [[Growltiger]], Terror of the Thames ('Growltiger's Last Stand'). He tells the story about the pirate's romance with Griddlebone and how he was overtaken by the Siamese and forced to walk the plank.  Skimbleshanks is sleeping in the corner ('Skimbleshanks: The Railway Cat'), a cat  who is unofficially in charge of the night train to Glasgow. He is very clever and very important because if he is gone <U+201C>the train can<U+2019>t start<U+201D>.

With a third crash and an evil laugh, the "most wanted" cat, Macavity appears. He is a <U+201C>master criminal<U+201D> and never is found at the scene of the crime. He is a horrifying looking cat and a <U+201C>villain<U+201D> of the Jellicle Tribe. Macavity shows up and captures Old Deuteronomy. As the other cats try to follow him, [[Demeter (cat)|Demeter]] and Bombalurina sing what they know about Macavity, as they have had some sort of past with him ('Macavity: The Mystery Cat').  When they are finished, Macavity returns disguised as Old Deuteronomy. When revealed by Demeter, he fights with Munkustrap.

The Rum Tum Tugger suggests that the cats find [[Mr. Mistoffelees]] ('Magical Mr. Mistoffelees'). Mr. Mistoffelees is black and small and can perform many feats of magic that no other cat can do. The magical cat succeeds in bringing back Old Deuteronomy. He is praised by all the cats. The Jellicle choice can now be made.

Old Deuteronomy sits down and Grizabella appears for the final time. Old Deuteronomy allows her to have a chance to address the cats. Her faded appearance and lonely disposition have little effect on her song ('Memory'). The appeal succeeds and she is chosen to be the one ('Journey to the Heaviside Layer'). A large tire (although it may be something else, i.e., a huge paw, a chair festooned with ivy, a literal 'stairway to heaven', etc.) rises up with Old Deuteronomy and Grizabella. Once at the top Grizabella finishes the journey herself. Old Deuteronomy gives his closing speech to the human audience ('The Ad-dressing of Cats') and the show comes to a close.

==Characters==
===Principal characters===
These descriptions, in alphabetical order, are based on more recent versions of the show, although there are minor variations from production to production.

*'''Asparagus / [[Gus the Theatre Cat|Gus]]''' - The theatre cat. The same actor usually plays Asparagus as a general chorus cat, and a younger version of Gus, up to the song "Gus the Theatre Cat", in which he portrays an older Gus, and Growltiger, then afterwards continues to play younger Gus, "Asparagus." 
*'''[[Bombalurina (cat)|Bombalurina]]''' - A saucy red female. She sings a duet with Demeter.
*'''[[Bustopher Jones]]''' - A fat cat, a "twenty-five pounder." Dresses in a snappy tuxedo and spats. Respected by all, as the upper class "St James' Street Cat." In most productions, the actor playing Gus also plays Bustopher, though in early productions the part was handled by the actor playing Old Deuteronomy.<ref name=olc>{{cite web|url=http://www.reallyuseful.com/rug/shows/cats/cast/origlondon1981.htm|title=Original London Cast List|accessdate=2008-08-23|work=Really Useful Group site}}</ref>
*'''[[Demeter (cat)|Demeter]]''' - A very skittish female cat. She unmasks Macavity when he disguises as Old Deuteronomy.
*'''[[Grizabella]]''' - The former Glamour Cat who has lost her sparkle and now only wants to be accepted. Grizabella left the tribe when she was younger to see the world for herself. In doing so she faced the harshness of the outside world.
*'''[[Griddlebone]]''' - A fluffy white Persian cat, and Growltiger's lover in "Growltiger's Last Stand," where she sings "The Ballad of Billy M'caw" or the mock [[Italian language|Italian]] aria "In Una Tepida Notte" (depending on production) with Growltiger. Almost always played by the actress playing Jellylorum. Does not appear in productions which omit "Growltiger's Last Stand".
*'''[[Growltiger]]''' - A theatrical character Gus recalls playing in his youth, and who appears in Gus' memory of the production of "Growltiger's Last Stand." In some productions he is portrayed as a vicious pirate; in others he's more of a parody of a pirate. Does not appear in productions which omit "Growltiger's Last Stand."
*'''[[Jellylorum]]''' - A female who watches out for the kittens, along with Jennyanydots. She has a close relationship with Gus. Named after T. S. Eliot's own cat. The actress who plays Jellylorum usually also plays Griddlebone in "Growltiger's Last Stand."
*'''[[Jemima (cat)|Jemima]]''' - A kitten who is also a Rum Tum Tugger fan and friends with Electra, Etcetera, and Victoria. Can be sometimes used interchangeably with Sillabub, though Jemima is used in most international productions &nbsp;<U+2014> Sillabub was a name created for the American productions. However, the Japanese and Swedish casts include both Sillabub and Jemima as different characters.
*'''[[Jennyanydots]]''' - The old Gumbie cat. She sits all day and rules the mice and cockroaches at night.
*'''[[Macavity]]''' - He is the show's only real villain. The character is a literary [[allusion]] to the [[Sherlock Holmes]] character [[Professor Moriarty]]. Usually played by the same actor as Plato or Admetus.
*'''[[Mr. Mistoffelees]]''' - A young tom with magical powers. His signature dance move is "The Conjuring Turn," twenty-four [[Glossary_of_ballet#Fouett.C3.A9_rond_de_jambe_en_tournant|fouett<U+00E9>s en tournant]]. In UK and US productions, Mistoffelees has an alter-ego named Quaxo, who appears as a general chorus cat throughout the show, and is dressed slightly differently. In other productions Quaxo is a separate character. 
*'''[[Mungojerrie]]''' - Half of a pair of notorious cat-burglars, with Rumpleteazer.  Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer are most commonly remembered for their unique dance number where at the end, they both latch onto each other and do a "double windmill" across the stage.
*'''[[Munkustrap]]''' - The show's ''de facto'' narrator. A black and silver tom who is storyteller and protector of the Jellicle tribe. He is thought to be second in command after Old Deuteronomy.
*'''[[Old Deuteronomy]]''' - The lovable patriarch of the Jellicle Tribe. He is very old and dignified. The leader of the Jellicle Tribe.
*'''[[Rumpleteazer]]''' - Female half of a pair of notorious cat-burglars, with Mungojerrie.
*The '''[[Rum Tum Tugger]]''' - The ladies' tom. His temperament ranges from clownish to serious, and often sexual depending on the production; however, he is always flirtatious, and usually portrayed as a feline equivalent of [[Mick Jagger]] or [[Elvis Presley]], and recognisable by his wild mane.
*'''[[Skimbleshanks]]''' - The railway cat. An active orange tabby cat, who lives on the trains and acts as an unofficial chaperone.
*'''[[Victoria the White Cat|Victoria]]''' - A pure white kitten gifted in dancing. The "official" Jellicle Ball begins with her solo dance.

===Other characters===
Chorus and dance roles. Many characters are production-specific versions of the same role. Often non-principal characters are omitted from smaller productions.
*'''[[Macavity (character)#Plato|Admetus]]''' - A young cat, who in many productions, also doubles as Macavity.  Generally productions have either Admetus or Plato filling the same function.
*'''[[Alonzo (cat)|Alonzo]]''' - A black and white tom in most productions; in the US and the early European productions, he is depicted as being a black and gold tabby. Sometimes considered the third in command after Munkustrap as he also fights Macavity.  
*'''[[Jellicle cats#Bill Bailey|Bill Bailey]]''' - Primarily from the London production, a young white and brown male. Sometimes interchangeable with the character of Tumblebrutus.
*'''[[Jellicle cats#Carbucketty|Carbucketty]]''' - The name was one of T. S. Eliot's ideas for cat names for a "knockabout cat." Sometimes interchangeable with the character of Pouncival.
*'''[[Jellicle cats#Cassandra|Cassandra]]''' - A brown and cream [[Abyssinian (cat)|Abyssinian]] queen, with a braided tail. Unique and somewhat mysterious.
*'''[[Jellicle cats#Coricopat and Tantomile|Coricopat]]''' - Male twin to Tantomile. The conventional stage action suggests that Coricopat and Tantomile are psychic cats, they sense the presence of danger before it becomes apparent to the other characters.
*'''[[Jellicle cats#Electra|Electra]]''' - A tabby kitten who seems to be friends with Etcetera as well as a fan of Rum Tum Tugger.
*'''[[Jellicle cats#Etcetera|Etcetera]]''' - A happy, energetic kitten who is a big Rum Tum Tugger fan. She is generally a pale tabby pattern.
*'''[[Jellicle cats#Exotica|Exotica]]''' - A female character who first appeared in the video version, and was a role initially created specially for [[Femi Taylor]]. The character also appears in the South African and World Tour.
*'''[[Jellicle cats#George|George]]''' - A young patchy male kitten that only appeared in the London production.
*'''Ghengis''' or '''Gilbert''' - The leader of the crew of Siamese cats who lead to Growltiger's demise. Usually played by the actor who portrays Mungojerrie, Tumblebrutus, or Coricopat. In Japan Gilbert is a separate character.
*'''[[Macavity#Plato|Plato]]''' - Teenage male cat; the actor usually doubles as Macavity. He does a [[pas de deux]] with Victoria during the Jellicle Ball.
*'''[[Jellicle cats#Pouncival|Pouncival]]''' - A playful tom kitten, generally interchangeable with Carbucketty.
*'''[[Rumpus Cat]]''' - A spiky-haired cat with glowing red eyes, as mentioned in "The Awefull Battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles," seen as a sort of superhero figure among the Jellicles. Does not appear in productions which omit the song "The Awefull Battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles." Usually played by Alonzo or Admetus. In some productions the actor is launched through the floor stage via a "star trap".
*'''[[Jemima (cat)#Sillabub|Sillabub]]''', the Broadway version of Jemima, although the Japanese and Swedish productions include both.
*'''[[Tumblebrutus]]''' - A playful young adult cat in his prime. Tumblebrutus is a brown and white tabby, characterized by a large, flame-like brown patch over his left eye. Very energetic, this young tom is featured in many dance numbers and has many featured soloes throughout the show. He is the Broadway version of Bill Bailey. 
*'''[[Jellicle cats#Coricopat and Tantomile|Tantomile]]''' - Female twin of Coricopat. The name was created by T.S. Eliot for a "Witch's Cat".<ref name=playbill>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatre-musical.com/cats/poems.html|title=A Brief History of the Poems

==Revisions to the show==
Andrew Lloyd Webber revised the Growltiger's Last Stand sequence for the Broadway production of Cats. In the original London show, the duet for Growltiger and Griddlebone was a setting of an unpublished T.S. Eliot poem, ''"The Ballad of Billy M'Caw"''. For Broadway, he replaced the Ballad with a pastiche of Italian aria (reminiscent of [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s [[Madama Butterfly]]). This new version was subsequently incorporated into most productions of Cats worldwide (A notable exception was the Hungarian production at the [[Mad<U+00E1>ch Sz<U+00ED>nh<U+00E1>z]] in Budapest which opened in 1983 and is still running in repertory as of early 2008 celebrating its 25th anniversary on March 25, 2008, as the longest running musical in Hungarian theatre history. Production in Helsinki and Prague also used the original version.) The Ballad remained in the London production until some time in the early 1990s when it was replaced with the Italian aria pastiche. It was re-instated for the UK Tours, following the show's closure in London. Lloyd Webber has said that he is pleased with the reinstatement of The Ballad of Billy McCaw as he didn't care for the "Italian aria" version<ref name=aria>{{cite web|url=http://www.catstour.co.uk/introduction.html|title=Cats UK Tour|accessdate=2008-04-23|work=Cats UK Tour }}</ref>.

The song "[[Mungojerrie]] and [[Rumpleteazer]]" has had three different versions in the past. In the original [[London]] production, Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer sang their song in 12/8 time to a jazzy accompaniment. Andrew Lloyd Webber later re-wrote the melody for the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, in which the character, [[Mr. Mistoffelees]], (also called Quaxo), would sing about Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer in the third person. The tempo remained upbeat (now in 2/4 time) and the mood of the song was similar to the original version. Lloyd Webber's new melody was used for all subsequent productions of Cats, although the song was eventually returned to its protagonists to sing (making the Broadway and London productions identical).

In recent productions, a lyric in '[[Growltiger's Last Stand]]' was changed in order to remove any racially insensitive language. "With a frightful burst of fireworks the [[Chink]]s they swarmed aboard!" became "with a frightful burst of fireworks, the [[Siamese (cat)|Siamese]] swarmed aboard!", although the lyric "Heathen Chinese" remains in the tale of the Pekes and the Pollicles.
