==Trivia==
*With this event, [[Joey Styles]] became the first (and as of 2007, the only) play-by-play announcer to call an entire pro wrestling PPV broadcast by himself, without a color commentator. Styles would later reference this in his ([[kayfabe]]) walkout on [[WWE RAW]] before returning to ECW. However, Tommy Dreamer was a guest commentator during the three-way dance.
*The event was put in jeopardy when [[iN DEMAND]] cancelled the show in response to the [[Mass Transit incident (ECW)|"Mass Transit" incident]]. However, iN DEMAND eventually changed their minds after much pleading from ECW promoter [[Paul Heyman]].
*''Barely Legal'' was released as part of a two-disc set with [[ECW One Night Stand#2006|One Night Stand 2006]] on [[July 11]], [[2006]]. It had previously been released in [[2000]] by Pioneer Entertainment as part of its "The Best of ECW" line of DVDs. The Pioneer release trimmed out many of the ring entrances, removed the music on the entrances not edited out (with the exception of songs ECW owned the rights to, including changing "[[Enter Sandman]]" from the [[Metallica]] version to [[Mot<U+00F6>rhead]]'s cover), and edited out the backstage promos and part of [[Shane Douglas]]'s promo in the ring. The release included with One Night Stand's DVD censored offensive language and changed the majority of the entrance music to music produced by [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] to avoid licensing fees.

==Production==
Getting the pay-per-view on in the first place was a struggle. [[iN DEMAND]], which at the time was called '''Viewer's Choice''', was very hesitant at putting ECW on pay-per-view because they felt that ECW was too vulgar and brutal, and did not air the show. Paul Heyman claimed that this was part and partial due to the fact that [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) was being reprimanded over its violent content at the time, but it was still getting PPVs. [[Request TV]] agreed to give ECW a pay-per-view under the condition that it aired at 9:00 p.m. rather than the usual 8:00 p.m. time slot. A power transformer blew out shortly after the show went off the air due to all the power being used by the building. It is believed, had the show gone on even 10 seconds too late, they would have lost the feed.
