'''''The Last of Us Remastered''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[survival horror]] video game developed by [[Naughty Dog]] and published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]. An enhanced port of 2013's ''[[The Last of Us]]'', ''Remastered'' was released for the [[PlayStation 4]] on July 29, 2014. Among minor gameplay additions, the game features enhanced graphics and rendering upgrades including increased [[draw distance]], an upgraded combat mechanic and higher [[frame rate]].

The game is set twenty years after an outbreak destroyed much of civilization, exploring the possibility of a fungus infecting humans . The [[Single-player video game|single-player]] story follows Joel, tasked with escorting the young Ellie across a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] United States, in an attempt to create a potential cure against the infection to which Ellie is immune. Players make their way through various locations, fighting against the Infected and hostile human survivors. The [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] lets up to eight players engage in cooperative or competitive game matches.

The game received critical acclaim. Reviewers were impressed with the graphics upgrades, praising all of the enhancements and additions. It also became a commercial success, selling over one million units within its first month.

In ''Remastered'', character textures were increased by a factor of four, shadows were doubled and a new lighting process was implemented. The [[motion blur]] when turning the [[Virtual camera system|camera]], used to hide slower loading textures, was reduced, and the game's environments look "crisper".<ref name="Re-Infection"/> In addition, new settings were introduced to allow players to customize the game's audio channels, and the [[Loader (computing)|loading]] times were reduced, due to the game streaming from the hard drive as opposed to the disc.<ref name="Re-Infection"/> One of the biggest developmental challenges was fitting all content onto one [[Blu-ray Disc]]. The changing of the in-game textures, and the inclusion of ''Left Behind'', were the cause for this difficulty.<ref name="Standard"/> According to lead developer Christian Gyrling, ''Remastered'' "looked broken up until a week before shipping".<ref name="Verge"/>

Development on ''Remastered'' began shortly following the release of ''The Last of Us'' in June 2013. Though initially under light development, the team began working harder on ''Remastered'' when they saw the demand for it;<ref name="Ages"/> work on the game's [[Source code|code]] did not begin until a larger team was introduced to ''Remastered'' in February 2014.
