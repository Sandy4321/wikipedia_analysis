==History==

{{seealso|History of Georgia Tech}}
A publication known as ''The Georgia Tech'' was Georgia Tech's first student newspaper. It was established in 1894 and was the second student publication to be established on campus. ''The Georgia Tech'' published a "Commencement Issue" that reviewed sporting events and gave information about each class.<ref name="ens">{{cite book|first=Robert C.|last=McMath|coauthors=Ronald H.

The ''Technique'' has been published weekly ever since, with the exception of a brief period that the paper was published twice weekly.<ref name="whatis"/> This period ran from January 14, 1948 to September 6, 1956.  ''The Georgia Tech'' and the ''Technique'' operated separately for several years following the ''Technique''{{'}}s establishment, though the two publications eventually merged in 1916.<!-- The following ref states that the student publication the Technique merged with was the Yellow Jacket; it was not. --><ref name="anakhistory"/> Several sources claim that ''The Technique'' is among a number of student organizations to be founded by the [[ANAK Society]].<ref name="anakhistory"/><ref>{{cite web|url= http://video.library.gatech.edu/cgi-bin/Griffin/griffin.pl?showpic=GP593&lastpicnum=20&search=technique&fieldtype=key&dispic=yes | title=Georgia Tech ANAK Society|work=Georgia Tech Archives Finding Aids|publisher=Georgia Tech Library|accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref>

==Present-day publication==
The ''Technique'' is published weekly during the Fall and Spring semesters, with the exceptions of "[[Dead Week]]," finals week and [[Spring Break]] and is published biweekly during the Summer semester. As of the 2005-2006 publication year, the paper has also taken a hiatus the week prior to Spring Break. General staff meetings are held on Tuesdays, when the majority of story assignments are made to a mostly volunteer writing staff.<ref>{{cite news|first=Alan|last=Back|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2002-01-18/opinions/2|title=STAFF EDITORIAL: Oldest living Technique writer tells all (at long last)|work=The Technique|date=2002-01-18|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> Deadline is on Wednesday nights during weeks when the paper is published,<ref name="aatt">{{cite news|first=Kyle|last=Thomason|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2005-08-26/news/13|title=All about the Technique|work=The Technique|date=2005-08-26|accessdate=2007-04-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060110211432/http://www.nique.net/issues/2005-08-26/news/13 |archivedate = January 10, 2006}}</ref> and the copy is sent to the printer on Thursday morning. The paper is then distributed around the campus on the Friday of that week. The ''Technique''{{'}}s office is located in the northwest corner of the Student Services Building.<ref name="aatt"/>

The paper is operated by a staff of approximately 50 paid and unpaid students, as well as two permanent, paid, non-student staff members. As Georgia Tech has no journalism school, the ''Technique'' welcomes all students within the Institute to contribute to its content. The ''Technique'' is funded primarily by advertisements, and to a lesser extent by Tech's [[Student Government Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sga.gatech.edu/files/Budget_2006-2007.xls|title=FY 2006-2007 Student Activity Fee Budget, As Passed|format=Excel document|accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref>

==Sections==
The ''Technique'' is generally between 16 and 40 pages long, the length of an issue being dependent upon the number of advertisements purchased for a given week. The paper is organized into five sections:
*News
:Includes Georgia Tech-specific crime reports<ref>{{cite news|first=Kenny|last=Baskett|url=http://nique.net/issues/2007-02-09/news/5|title=Campus Crime|date=2007-02-09|accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref> and news.
*Focus
:Includes [[Human interest story|human interest stories]].
*Entertainment
:Includes reviews of [[music]], [[movie]]s, [[performance arts]], and [[video game]]s, [[cartoon]]s, a [[crossword puzzle]], sudoku puzzles, and the [[The Technique#Two Bits|Two Bits]] column.
*Opinions

*Sports
:Includes summaries of recent [[Georgia Institute of Technology#Athletics|Georgia Tech sports]] games and sports features.

==Special editions==
===To Hell With Georgia===
The most well-known of the special issues the ''Technique'' publishes is a satire of The [[University of Georgia]]'s student newspaper (''[[The Red and Black]]'').<ref name="thwga">{{cite news|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2000-12-01/campus%20life/4|title=Nique staff does Athens in lavish style|work=The Technique|date=2000-12-01|accessdate=2007-03-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929140447/http://www.nique.net/issues/2000-12-01/campus+life/4 |archivedate = September 29, 2007}}</ref> The tradition of this parody dates back to the very first issue of the ''Technique'', which was published with the intent of taunting Georgia Tech's rival school, and has its roots in the [[Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate|embittered rivalry]] between Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia. It is published just before the two schools compete in football and is one of the last issues of the Fall semester. The parody is known as "To Hell With Georgia," after the school's popular cheer.<ref name="thwga"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lcc.gatech.edu/~herrington/3020sp99sites/tbook/index.html|title=Traditions: "The Good Word"|work=T-Book|accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref> On years where the schools play their [[american football|football]] match at UGA's [[Sanford Stadium]], ''Technique'' staff distribute the issue across UGA's campus.<ref name="thwga"/>  In 2009, the THWGA issue was printed with an incorrect year in the masthead, though the date was corrected in the version posted online.

===Freshman Issue===
The Freshman Issue is another special edition of the ''Technique''. It is the first issue published each academic year and is by far the longest issue, with each of the sections about as long as a normal issue. The content usually centers on the themes of welcoming Freshmen and welcoming returning students back to Tech. The Freshman Issue also contains a special section dedicated to helping Freshmen become more acquainted with Tech and its customs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nique.net/issues/2006-08-25/pdf|title=2006 Freshman Issue|work=The Technique|date=2006-08-25|accessdate=2007-02-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070208163209/http://www.nique.net/issues/2006-08-25/pdf |archivedate = February 8, 2007}}</ref> It is generally the only issue in which content from previous issues is reprinted.

===Other special editions===
Other special editions include the Homecoming issue, the [[April Fool's Day|April Fool's]] issue (historically known as the Techlique, which includes a section of fake news parodying Tech in a similar style to the "To Hell With Georgia" issue) and the "Best of Tech" issue, which is the final issue of the Spring semester.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://technique.library.gatech.edu/pdfs/best_of_tech-2006-04-21.pdf|title=The Best & Worst of Tech|work=The Technique|date=2006-04-21|accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref>

==Recurring features==
===Two Bits===
The ''Technique'' featured an anonymous humor column called "Two Bits," which is authored by the mysterious Two Bits Man, a sarcastic, everyday [[virtuoso]] who concerns himself with Tech- and university-specific subjects.<ref>{{cite news|name=Two Bits Man|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2006-09-01/entertainment/6|title=A lesson in love, a lecture on hate: that's the Tech way|work=The Technique|date=2006-09-10|accessdate=2007-03-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929140430/http://www.nique.net/issues/2006-09-01/entertainment/6 |archivedate = September 29, 2007}}</ref> His articles range from relentless sickly sniffles to school-wide subjects of controversy or interest. Popular targets for his scorn include Georgia Tech's [[Parking]] department and School of [[Physics]], whereas he consistently praises the President Emeritus [[G. Wayne Clough]], who he refers to as "Funk Masta G. Wayne".<ref>{{cite news|name=Two Bits Man|url=http://nique.net/issues/2007-01-19/entertainment/8|title=Two Bits shares an attempt at lyrical poetry about Funkmasta G.

===Sliver Box===
One of the ''Technique''{{'}}s most popular features is the Sliver Box, an analogue of the Vent feature of the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', which allows readers to submit any comment they wish.<ref name="sliver">{{cite news|first=Lauren|last=Griffin|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2005-02-18/opinions/3|title=Avoid common sliver misconceptions|work=The Technique|date=2005-02-18|accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref> Comments are submitted on the ''Technique''{{'}}s website and as many Slivers that will fit appear in the week's paper, usually in order of submission. Slivers are subject to minimal censorship,<ref name="sliver"/> with only full names of non-public figures, personal information and strong profanities typically removed or altered. Other entries are occasionally removed or truncated, usually in cases of spamming of the Sliver submission system. According to the paper, the Box is used to fill empty room left between advertisements<ref name="sliver"/> in order to maintain a [[modular]] layout style. It is not uncommon for students to have conversations using the Sliver Box. Slivers were originally comments made by editorial board members during deadline night and were placed in narrow boxes ("Slivers") at the bottom of each page.<ref name="sliver"/> Comments made on deadline night and opinions of [[editorial board]] members still occasionally find their way into the Sliver Box.
