'''Reactions to [[Occupy Wall Street]]''' have varied. The ongoing protests and demonstrations have garnered both praise and criticism from varying parts of the world.
=== Public opinion ===
National polls from October to December 2011 were mixed, with agreement/approval ratings for Occupy Wall Street varying from 59% to 22%, but approval was fairly consistently larger than disapproval, with large numbers often not giving an opinion. On December 19, ''[[MSNBC]]'' reported a study which showed small-business owners "are almost evenly split on whether they support the protest movement."<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45367550/ns/business-small_business/t/business-owners-divided-occupy-wall-street/#.Tu1l0ZjrRSV Business Owners Divided on Occupy Wall Street - Business - msnbc.com] 11/19/2011, Retrieved 12/18/11</ref>  Among the general public, opinions of OWS have varied over time, and there are contradictions between the data collected by various polling agencies.

During an October 6 news conference, President Obama said, "I think it expresses the frustrations the American people feel, that we had the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression, huge collateral damage all throughout the country ... and yet you're still seeing some of the same folks who acted irresponsibly trying to fight efforts to crack down on the abusive practices that got us into this in the first place."<ref name="Obama news conference: Obama: Occupy Wall Street protests show Americans' frustration"/><ref name="Obama acknowledges Wall Street protests as a sign"/><ref name="Obama Speaks on Occupy Wall Street Oct 6"/> When [[Jake Tapper]] of ABC News pushed Obama to explain the fact that his administration hasn't prosecuted any Wall Street executives who didn't play by the rules, he replied, "One of the biggest problems about the collapse of Lehman's and the subsequent financial crisis and the whole subprime lending fiasco is that a lot of that stuff wasn't necessarily illegal; it was just immoral or inappropriate or reckless."<ref name="Wall Street Corruption, Solyndra, and Fast & Furious: Today's Q's for O"/><ref name="Obama: Not all pre-crisis financial ploys illegal"/> On October 18, when interviewed by ABC news, he said "in some ways, they<U+2019>re not that different from some of the protests that we saw coming from the Tea Party.

[[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Democratic Leader Rep.]] [[Nancy Pelosi]], said she supports the growing nationwide Occupy Wall Street movement. Pelosi said she includes herself in the group of Americans dissatisfied with [[United States Congress|Congress]] and stated, "I support the message to the establishment, whether it's Wall Street or the political establishment and the rest, that change has to happen.

[[House Majority Leader]] [[Eric Cantor]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Virginia|Va]]), in a speech to a Values Voter Summit, characterized the movement as "growing mobs" and said that Obama's "failed policies" and rhetoric "condon[ing] the pitting of Americans against Americans" were to blame. In response, White House Press Secretary [[Jay Carney]] accused Cantor of "unbound" hypocrisy, given the Majority Leader's support of the Tea Party protests, adding, "I don't understand why one man's mob is another man's democracy." Carney characterized both movements as examples of American democratic traditions.<ref name="Obama, Cantor spar over Occupy Wall Street"/>

Former Speaker of the House of Representatives and [[Newt Gingrich presidential campaign, 2012|2012 Republican presidential candidate]] [[Newt Gingrich]] was quoted as saying at the 2012 Bloomberg/Washington Post Debate, "Let me draw a distinction. Virtually every American has a reason to be angry. I think virtually [every] American has a reason to be worried.

Noting the growing union support, an article in the progressive-leaning ''[[Mother Jones magazine|Mother Jones]]'' magazine said that union support could splinter and derail the protests rather than sustain them because while unions are tightly organized, hierarchical, and run with a clear chain of command, Occupy Wall Street is the opposite in that they are "a horizontal, autonomous, leaderless, modified-consensus-based system with roots in anarchist thought."  However, the article went on to suggest that if the unions and OWS joined together they could work to create a progressive movement that "effectively taps into the rising feeling among many Americans that economic opportunity has been squashed by corporate greed and the influence of the very rich in politics."<ref name="Occupy Wall Street, Powered by Big Labor"/>  As the success of the movement has become apparent, union organizers have begun to embrace some of their social media skills, bold tactics, and the simplicity of the 99% slogan.

=== Federal Reserve response ===
During a hearing before the Joint Economic Committee October 4, 2011, [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] Chairperson [[Ben Bernanke]] said, "[P]eople are quite unhappy with the state of the economy and what<U+2019>s happening. They blame, with some justification, the problems in the financial sector for getting us into this mess, and they<U+2019>re dissatisfied with the policy response here in Washington. And at some level, I can<U+2019>t blame them. Certainly, 9 percent unemployment and very slow growth is not a good situation."<ref name="thinkprogress"/> On November 2, he again expressed sympathy with frustrations about the economy but also said many of the complaints levied at the Fed, including those made against the steps it took during the financial crisis, are misguided.  <U+201C>The concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>A very simplistic interpretation of that [criticism] was that we were doing that because we wanted to preserve banker salaries.

[[Douglas Rushkoff]], writing for CNN, said that even though the protesters are not ready to articulate an exact array of problems or how to solve them,

{{Quotation|Anyone who says he has no idea what these folks are protesting is not being truthful. Whether we agree with them or not, we all know what they are upset about, and we all know that there are investment bankers working on Wall Street getting richer while things for most of the rest of us are getting tougher. What upsets banking's defenders and politicians alike is the refusal of this movement to state its terms or set its goals in the traditional language of campaigns...They mean to show that there is an inappropriate and correctable disconnect between the abundance America produces and the scarcity its markets manufacture.<ref name="DouglasRushkoff" />}}

In a special for CNN, Sonia Katyal and Eduardo Pe<U+00F1>alver said that

{{quotation|What has puzzled many observers about the Occupy Wall Street protests is precisely the lack of an obvious connection between their disobedience (the occupation of parks and streets) and their political and economic complaints. This is why Occupy's turn toward foreclosed housing is so important.  While it takes heroic acts of imagination to connect the dots between the occupation of Zuccotti Park and worries about economic inequality, political corruption and the excessive power of banks, the connection between these issues and the occupation of foreclosed housing is obvious.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>}}

MSNBC's ''Technolog'' noted that policymakers had failed to address economic problems, and news media had failed to cover the unemployment crisis: "Tracking CNN, MSNBC and Fox, ThinkProgress found 7,583 mentions of the word 'debt,' compared to 427 mentions of 'unemployment' on all three networks combined." [[Nielsen Online|NM Incite]] said 22% of [[Twitter|tweets]] using the #OccupyWallStreet [[hashtag]] voiced general support for the movement, 11% indicated participation in it,<!-- we should measure this in terms of what it means for the number of tweeters who say they are participating --> 5% described celebrity support, 11% were complaints against the movement, 13% shared news, 6% shared videos, 4% blamed government, 2% blamed Obama, and 1% blamed capitalism.

Police reaction has varied. Some incidents have been criticized. The [[New York City Police Department]] has assigned Rick Lee, a First Precinct community relations detective, to duty at the demonstration. He is one of the department's main liaisons with the protesters on behalf of the police department, and advises protesters on such matters as, avoiding arrest and getting along with police as well as attempting to get information of protesters plans.

=== Criticism ===

{{POV section|New_version_of_text_summarizing_how_RS_have_characterized_criticism_of_OWS|date=December 2011}}
There has been criticism of the Occupy Wall Street movement by various groups and individuals. According to recent polling, most Republican voters have an unfavorable view of the movement by a large margin.<ref name="QuinnipiacNov3"/>

In an opinion piece in the ''Wall Street Journal'', pollster [[Douglas Schoen]] wrote that the protesters reflect "values that are dangerously out of touch with the broad mass of the American people" and have "a deep commitment to left-wing policies: opposition to free-market capitalism and support for radical redistribution of wealth, intense regulation of the private sector, and protectionist policies to keep American jobs from going overseas", and that politicians who support them will be hurt in the 2012 elections.<ref name="WSJ-Schoen">{{cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204479504576637082965745362.html |title=Polling the Occupy Wall Street Crowd |first=Douglas |last=Schoen |date=18 |month=October |year=2011 |work=The Wall Street Journal |quote=Last week, senior White House adviser David Plouffe said that "the protests you're seeing are the same conversations people are having in living rooms and kitchens all across America. . . . People are frustrated by an economy that does not reward hard work and responsibility, where Wall Street and Main Street don't seem to play by the same set of rules." Nancy Pelosi and others have echoed the message.  Yet the Occupy Wall Street movement reflects values that are dangerously out of touch with the broad mass of the American people<U+2014>and particularly with swing voters who are largely independent and have been trending away from the president since the debate over health-care reform.  The protesters have a distinct ideology and are bound by a deep commitment to radical left-wing policies.

Mike Brownfield of [[The Heritage Foundation]] argued that rejection of the capitalist system and the policies that OWS protesters advocate, including limits on trade and student loan forgiveness, would not lead to improved economic conditions for unemployed Americans. According to Brownfield, the Foundation believes it is "right to decry out-of-control bailouts and corporate subsidies" and there are valid concerns regarding the economy, unemployment rates and low job creation. However, Heritage argued that capitalism is key to improving the economy and that the movement is focusing on the wrong solutions to the problems they protest: it should be protesting the expansion of government instead of calling for more government intervention.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.heritage.org/2011/10/18/morning-bell-wall-street-is-the-wrong-place-to-occupy/ |title=Morning Bell: Wall Street is the Wrong Place to Occupy |last1=Brownfield |first1=Mike |date=October 18, 2011 |work=blog.heritage.org |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref>

Some residents of the area surrounding Zuccotti Park have voiced complaints about the demonstrations. A caller to a radio show complained that the park has been rendered "unusable" by the protesters, and that "a general atmosphere of incivility," together with loud shouting and drums, prevailed; another complained that the drums from the protest, which he said "start in the morning" and get louder in the evening until 11:30&nbsp;pm, made it difficult for his children to sleep or do their homework. Another resident complained that protesters had been vandalizing and urinating in the vestibule to his apartment building.<ref name="NY Post Bloomberg article"/>  Responding to a caller to his radio show complaining about noise and incivility at the park, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said "we couldn't agree more."<ref name="NY Post Bloomberg article"/> The Mayor has been criticized for alienating both supporters and critics for his stance that seems supportive of the protests one day and opposed on others.

CNBC correspondent [[Jane Wells]] reported that the Occupy Wall Street movement sparked parodies which connect the movement to pop culture icons from ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' and others. An image of [[Luke Skywalker]] holding a protest sign was published: "It wasn't glamorous but I had a steady living working on my uncle's moisture farm... my aunt and uncle were unjustly murdered and the farm destroyed. I was forced to leave my home and join an extinct cult just to survive. I am now a member of an upstart movement to take down a greedy corrupt establishment. I AM THE 99%."
