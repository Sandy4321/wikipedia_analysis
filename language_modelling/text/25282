Jigsaw successfully defended his title for a year and was forced to vacate it for the 2005 edition of the Young Lions Cup tournament.<ref name=ChikaraFans/> Jigsaw feuded the rest of the year with fellow Chikara veteran [[Hallowicked (wrestler)|Hallowicked]] and defeated him in a two out of three falls match on November 13, 2005.<ref name=ChikaraFans/> In early 2006 Jigsaw entered the [[Tag World Grand Prix 2006|Tag World Grand Prix]] teaming with [[Arik Cannon]], but the team were eliminated in the second round of the tournament by [[Osamu Nishimura]] and [[Katsushi Takemura]].<ref name=ChikaraFans/> Jigsaw would then enter a feud with Icarus, whom he would defeat on July 22, 2006, in a [[Lucha libre#Luchas de apuestas|mask vs. hair match]].<ref name=ChikaraFans/> The remainder of the year Jigsaw spent teaming with Mike Quackenbush and [[Shane Storm]].<ref name=ChikaraFans/> 2007 started off with Jigsaw, Quackenbush and Storm winning the inaugural [[King of Trios]] tournament.<ref name=ChikaraFans/> Afterwards the trio went on a losing streak and on October 27, 2007, Jigsaw turned on Storm and pinned him in a tag team match to end the union for good.<ref name=ChikaraFans/> After competing in a trios match on November 16, 2007, Jigsaw left Chikara, in order to concentrate on his work with [[Ring of Honor]].<ref name=ChikaraFans/>

At ''Breakout'' in January 2008, Jigsaw teamed with [[M-Dogg 20|Matt Cross]] to take on [[The Briscoe Brothers]].

===Return to Chikara (2008<U+2013>present)===
Jigsaw made a return to Chikara, sans mask, in September 2008, saving his Mike Quackenbush from a violent assault at the hands of the UnStable alliance ([[Vin Gerard]], [[Colin Delaney]] and STIGMA (the former Shane Storm)).<ref name=ChikaraFans/> Despite his help, Quackenbush refused to accept him back into the promotion.<ref name=ChikaraFans/> The following month, Vin Gerard attempted to recruit Jigsaw to the UnStable, noting that the two had a lot in common regarding their former identities under masks and their rejections from the Chikara locker room.<ref name=ChikaraFans/> Jigsaw refused to accept the spot and superkicked STIGMA, with Quackenbush aiding him in chasing the ''rudos'' away.<ref name=ChikaraFans/> On December 14, 2008, Quackenbush and [[Tim Donst]] were slated to face Delaney and STIGMA in a tag team match.<ref name=ChikaraFans/> However, during the match Donst suffered an injury, which led to Jigsaw entering the match with his mask back on. The match ended with Jigsaw pinning STIGMA with the Jig 'n' Tonic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=2056|title=<U+201C>Duel and Duality<U+201D> <U+2013> 12/14/2008|publisher=Chikara Fans|accessdate=2010-01-08}}</ref>

In early 2009 Jigsaw and Quackenbush scored their third win in a row, which meant that they could now challenge for the [[Chikara Campeonatos de Parejas]].<ref name=ChikaraFans/> The championship match took place on April 25, but Jigsaw and Quackenbush were unable to defeat the reigning champions [[The Osirian Portal]] (Amasis and Ophidian).<ref name=ChikaraFans/> With Quackenbush out with a knee injury, he positioned Jigsaw as the mentor for the stable of younger wrestlers, called The Future Is Now, which consisted of [[Jimmy Olsen (wrestler)|Jimmy "Equinox" Olsen]], [[Ricochet (wrestler)|Helios]] and [[Lince Dorado]].<ref name=ChikaraFans/> During the rest of the year he also feuded with Gran Akuma, whom he would defeat in the main event on November 21.<ref name=Throwing>{{cite web|url=http://chikarafans.com/?page_id=5033|title=<U+201C>Throwing Life<U+2019>s Instructions Away<U+201D> <U+2013> 11/21/2009|publisher=Chikara Fans|accessdate=2010-01-08}}</ref>
