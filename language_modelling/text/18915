'''Michael J. Coppola''' (born in 1946), also known as '''"Mikey Cigars"''', is an American mobster in the [[Genovese crime family]]. He shouldn't be confused with [[Michael "Trigger Mike" Coppola]], also of the Genovese crime family. Michael Coppola has been a member of the Genovese crime family since the 1960s. He is currently believed to be a [[caporegime]] (captain) in the family and is a close associate of [[Tino Fiumara]]. Coppola served almost 5 years in prison from 1979 to 1983 for conspiracy and extortion.<ref>http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/mike_coppolla/index.html</ref>

==Alleged murder==
In 1996 Coppola was charged in the 1977 killing of John "Johnny Cokes" Lardiere.<ref name="Fugitive">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/nyregion/13mbrfs-mob.html</ref> According to authorities, Lardiere was released for 26 hours from prison to spend the Easter holidays with his family. Rumors had been spreading among the crime family while he was locked up that he had turned against the mob, and that he'd disrespected the boss. When Lardiere got out of his car, Coppola was standing in front of him with a .22 automatic pistol, complete with a silencer. When Coppola squeezed the trigger, the gun jammed. Lardiere was both amused and annoyed by the man and allegedly said "What're you gonna do now, tough guy?". Coppola responded by pulling up his pant leg, and removing a .38 revolver from an ankle holster and shooting Lardiere four times. When police arrived at the crime scene, they knew immediately it was a mob hit. The shooter had left behind his weapons and a hat. In 1996 and unidentified mobster who'd been arrested on murder and extortion charges, decided to cooperate with authorities. He said that Lardiere's killer was Michael Coppola. The informant told police that he'd heard the entire story of Lardiere's murder from Coppola at a party.

==Wanted fugitive==
Coppola left his gun and hat at the murder scene. Since the advancement of forensics since 1977, a judge ordered Coppola to submit a D.N.A. test in 1996. When the F.B.I. requested a D.N.A. sample which could of proved he was at the murder scene on August 8, 1996, Coppola went on the lam with his wife.<ref name="FBI">http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/07/02/2009-07-02_mobster_wont_rat_out_pals_in_genovese_crew.html</ref> He spent most his time moving between apartments in [[San Francisco]] and [[New York City]].<ref name="Coppola">http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/slay_rap_for_mob_puff_baddy_ai2Y5rWLh0hDkCWeD7zm4K</ref> During his time on the run, he was featured on [[America's Most Wanted]]. On March 9, 2007, after 11 years on the run Coppola and his wife Linda were found and arrested.<ref name="Fugitive"/> While conducting a search of their [[Upper West Side]] home they found a book entitled "The Methods of Attacking Scientific Evidence".<ref name="Coppola"/> Coppola pleaded guilty to fugitive charges and was given a 42 month (3 and a half years) sentence. Coppola was pictured grinning throughout the trial. His wife Linda also pleaded guilty to harboring a fugitive and received probation. Louis Rizzo Jr., Coppola's step son was also convicted for conspiracy to harbor a fugitive and sentenced to 3 years in prison.<ref>http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2008/05/longtime_fugitive_michael_copp.html</ref> Rizzo's release date is November 11, 2009.

==Arrest and trial==
In 2009 the F.B.I. believed that Coppola was going to become a government witness and testify against the Genovese family.<ref name="FBI"/> The F.B.I. was willing to free him of all charges and enter the [[Witness Protection Program]] if he cooperated. The F.B.I. believed he was involved in the the killing of [[Lawrence Ricci]] on the orders of [[Tino Fiumara]], one of the men the F.B.I. was hoping to prosecute with Coppola's cooperation.<ref name="FBI"/> Coppola waived a speedy arraignment and spent the next two nights sleeping at F.B.I. headquarters in lower Manhattan at an undisclosed hotel. He also met with a government arranged lawyer known as a "shadow counsel". On the third day however, Coppola refused to cooperate. His defense lawyer Henry Mazurek said that Coppola only dragged out the process in concern for his wife, who he feared would also be arrested and charged.<ref name="FBI"/>

In July 2009 he was put on trial for the murder of John "Johnny Cokes" Lardiere and for extorting the Local 1235 of the [[International Longshoremen's Association]] for over 30 years.<ref name="Trial">http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/brooklyn/mikey_cigars_convicted_of_racketeering_TghPo7hysFzueOxzcvI6TK</ref> A witness refuted the story that Lardiere taunted the killer and said all he heard was a "horrifying scream".<ref>http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/brooklyn/witness_doing_boom_boom_didn_hear_7mWJQOYXadKSZjapeN2boO</ref> On July 21, 2009 Coppola was acquitted of the murder,<ref name="Trial"/> partially due to the D.N.A. test proving inconclusive since it matched 11 million white men in America. He was however, found guilty of extortion and possessing false identification while he was a fugitive.<ref name="Trial"/> As of October 2009, be has yet to be sentenced, but faces up to 20 years in prison. Coppola nodded and mouthed the words, "It's O.K.," to his wife after the verdict.<ref>http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/07/22/2009-07-22_michael_mikey_cigars_coppola_beats_murder_rap.html</ref> He is currently serving his original fugitive sentence at the [[Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn]] while waiting for his current sentence to be announced.
