'''Sergei Vasilievich Rachmaninoff''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0421><U+0435><U+0440><U+0433><U+0435><U+0439> <U+0412><U+0430><U+0441><U+0438><U+043B><U+044C><U+0435><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+0420><U+0430><U+0445><U+043C><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432>}}, ''Sergej Vasil<U+2019>evi<U+010D> Rachmaninov'', [[1 April]], [[1873]] ([[Gregorian calendar|N.S.]]) or 20 March 1873 ([[Julian calendar|O.S.]]) &ndash; [[28 March]] [[1943]]) was a [[Russia|Russian]] [[composer]], [[pianist]], and [[conducting|conductor]]. ("Sergei Rachmaninoff" was the spelling the composer himself used while living in the [[Western world|West]] throughout the latter half of his life.  However, alternative transliterations of his name include ''Sergey'' or ''Serge'', and ''Rachmaninov'', ''Rachmaninow'', ''Rakhmaninov'' or ''Rakhmaninoff''.)

[[Image:Sergei Rachmaninoff LOC 33969u.jpg|thumb|right|Sergei Rachmaninoff]]
Rachmaninoff is regarded as one of the most influential pianists of the twentieth century. He had legendary technical facilities and rhythmic drive, and his large hands were able to cover the interval of a [[interval (music)|thirteenth]] on the keyboard (a hand span of approximately twelve inches). His large handspan roughly corresponded with his height; Rachmaninoff was 6 feet 6 inches (1.98m) tall [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006245/bio].  He also had the ability to play complex compositions upon first hearing.  Many recordings were made by the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] recording label of Rachmaninoff's performing his own music, as well as works from the standard repertory.  

His reputation as a composer, on the other hand, has generated controversy since his death.  The 1954 edition of ''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' notoriously dismissed his music as ''"monotonous in texture ... consist[ing] mainly of artificial and gushing tunes ..."'' and predicted that his popular success was ''"not likely to last"''. [http://www.arlindo-correia.com/041202.html]  To this, Harold C. Schoenberg, in his ''Lives of the Great Composers'', responded, ''"It is one of the most outrageously snobbish and even stupid statements ever to be found in a work that is supposed to be an objective reference."''  Indeed, not only have Rachmaninoff's works become part of the standard repertory, but their popularity among both musicians and audiences has, if anything, increased during the second half of the twentieth century, with some of his [[symphony|symphonies]] and other [[orchestra]]l works, [[song]]s and [[choral]] music recognized as masterpieces alongside the more familiar piano works.

His compositions include, among others, four [[piano concerto|piano concerti]], three [[symphony|symphonies]], two [[piano sonata]]s, three [[opera]]s, a [[choir|choral]] symphony (''[[The Bells]]'', based on the [[The Bells|poem]] by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]), the ''[[All-Night Vigil]]'' for unaccompanied choir (often known as Rachmaninoff's [[Vespers]]),  the [[Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini]], 24 Preludes (including the famous [[Prelude in C-sharp minor (Rachmaninoff)|Prelude in C-sharp minor]]), 17 [[<U+00C9>tudes-Tableaux (Rachmaninoff)|<U+00C9>tudes-tableaux]], [[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff) | Symphonic Dances]] and many [[Lied|songs]], of which the most famous are "V molchanyi nochi taynoi" ("In the silence of night") and the wordless ''[[Vocalise (Rachmaninoff)|Vocalise]]''. Most of his pieces are in a melancholy, late [[romantic music|Romantic]] style akin to [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], although strong influences of [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin|Chopin]] and [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] are apparent. Further inspiration included the music of [[Mily Balakirev|Balakirev]], [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]], [[Nikolai Karlovich Medtner|Medtner]] (whom he considered the greatest contemporary composer and who, according to Schoenberg's ''Lives'', returned the compliment by imitating him) and [[Adolf von Henselt|Henselt]].

==Life==
=== Youth ===
Rachmaninoff was born in [[Semyonovo]], near [[Velikiy Novgorod|Novgorod]] in [[Northwestern Federal District|north-western]] [[Russia]], into a noble family of [[Tatar]] descent, who had been in the service of the Russian tsars since the 16th century. His parents were both amateur pianists, and he had his first [[piano]] lessons with his mother on their family estate at [[Oneg]]; however, his parents noticed no outstanding talent in the youngster. Because of financial difficulties, the family moved to [[Saint Petersburg]], where Rachmaninoff studied at the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory|Conservatory]] before moving to [[Moscow]]. There, he studied piano under [[Nikolay Zverev]] and [[Alexander Siloti]] (who was his cousin and a former student of [[Franz Liszt]]). He also studied [[harmony]] under [[Anton Arensky]], and [[counterpoint]] under [[Sergei Taneyev]]. It should be noted that, in his younger days, Rachmaninoff was found to be quite lazy, failing most of his classes and spending much time skating. It was the strict regime of the Zverev home (a place for many young musicians, including [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]]) that instilled discipline in the boy.

Already, in his early years, he showed great skill in composition. While still a student, he wrote the one-act [[opera]], ''[[Aleko (opera)|Aleko]]'' (for which he was awarded a gold medal in composition), his first piano concerto and a set of piano pieces, ''Morceaux de Fantaisie'' (Op. 3, 1892), including the popular and famous [[Prelude in C-sharp minor (Rachmaninoff)|Prelude in C-sharp minor]]. (According to Francis Crociata<U+2019>s liner notes to [[RCA|RCA's]] 10-CD set of Rachmaninoff<U+2019>s recordings, the composer later became annoyed by the public<U+2019>s fascination with this piece, composed when he was just 19.  He would often tease an expectant audience by asking, <U+201C>Oh, must I?<U+201D> or claiming inability to remember anything else.)   Rachmaninoff confided in Zverev his desire to compose more, requesting a private room where he could compose in silence, but Zverev saw him only as a pianist and severed his links with the boy. After the success of ''Aleko'', however, Zverev welcomed him back as a composer and pianist. His first serious pieces for the piano were composed and performed as a student, at the age of thirteen, during his residence with Zverev. In 1892, at nineteen, he completed his [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 1]] (Op. 1, 1891), which he revised in 1917.

=== Initial setbacks === 
[[Image:Rachmaninoff.jpg|thumb|250px|Rachmaninoff, from a 1921 [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]] advertisement]]
Rachmaninoff's [[Symphony No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)|Symphony No. 1]] (Op. 13, 1896) premiered on [[27 March]] [[1897]] in one of a long-running series of "Russian Symphony Concerts", but was torn apart by critics. In a particularly vitriolic review by [[C<U+00E9>sar Cui]], it was likened to a depiction of the plagues of Egypt and suggested that it would be admired by the "inmates" of a music conservatory in hell. It is often mooted that the criticisms stem from inadequacy of the performance. The [[conducting]] of [[Alexander Glazunov]] is often remembered as a problem: he liked the piece, but was a weak conductor and starved of rehearsal time. Rachmaninoff's wife later suggested that [[Glazunov]] may have been drunk and, although this was never intimated by Rachmaninoff, it would not seem out of character. The disastrous reception, coupled with his distress over the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]'s objection to his marrying his cousin, Natalia Satina, contributed to a period of severe [[depression (mood)|depression]].  

He wrote little music over the following years, until he began a course of [[autosuggestive therapy]] with [[psychologist]] [[Nikolai Dahl]], an amateur musician himself. Rachmaninoff quickly recovered his confidence.  An important result of these sessions was the composition of the [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 2]] (Op. 18, 1900&ndash;01), which was dedicated to Dr. Dahl. The piece was very well received at its premiere at which Rachmaninoff was soloist, and remains one of his most popular compositions.

Rachmaninoff's spirits were further bolstered when, after years of engagement, he was finally allowed to marry Natalia. They were married in a suburb of [[Moscow]] by an army [[priest]] on April 29, 1902, and their union lasted until the composer's death. After several successful appearances as a conductor, Rachmaninoff was offered a job as conductor at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] in 1904, although political reasons led to his resignation in March of 1906, after which he stayed in [[Italy]] (in [[Florence]] and then [[Marina di Pisa]]) until July. He spent the following three winters in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]], intensively working as a composer and returning to the family estate of [[Ivanovka]] every summer.

===Emigration to the U.S.===
Rachmaninoff made his first tour of the [[United States]] as a pianist in 1909, an event for which he composed the [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 3]] (Op. 30, 1909). This successful tour made him a popular figure in America.

Following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], which meant the end of the old Russia, Rachmaninoff with his wife and two daughters left [[Saint Petersburg]] for [[Stockholm]] on 22 December 1917. They never returned to the home country afterwards. Rachmaninoff then settled in [[Denmark]] and spent a year giving concerts in [[Scandinavia]]. He left from [[Kristiania]] ([[Oslo]]) to [[New York]] on [[1 November]] [[1918]], which marked the beginning of the American period of the composer's life. After Rachmaninoff's departure, his music was banned in the [[Soviet Union]] for several years. His compositional output slowed, partly because he was required to spend much of his time performing to support his family, but mainly because of [[homesickness]]; he felt that, when he left Russia, it was as if he had left behind his inspiration.

Settling in the U.S., Rachmaninoff began making recordings for [[Thomas Edison]] in 1919, recording on an upright piano that the inventor admitted was not very good, but the discs provided the composer with some much-need income.  The next year he signed an exclusive contract with the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] and continued to make recordings for Victor until February 1942. 

The falloff in Rachmaninoff's output was dramatic.  Between 1892 and 1917 (mainly living in Russia), Rachmaninoff wrote 39 compositions with [[opus number]]s.  Between 1918 and his death in 1943, mainly living in the U.S., he completed only six.

As the years went on, and he became more and more aware of the fact that he would never again return to his beloved homeland, he was overwhelmed with melancholia.  Most people who knew him later in life described him as the ''saddest'' man they had ever known.  Nevertheless, his [[Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini]], today one of his best-known works, was written in Switzerland in 1934.

He went on to compose his [[Symphony No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Symphony No. 3]] (Op. 44, 1935&ndash;36) and the ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'' (Op. 45, 1940), his last completed work. He fell ill during a concert tour in late 1942, and was subsequently diagnosed with advanced [[melanoma]]. 

Rachmaninoff and his wife became American citizens on [[1 February]] [[1943]]. His last recital, given on [[17 February]] 1943 at the [[University of Tennessee]] Alumni Gymnasium, prophetically featured [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 2 in B flat Minor (Chopin)|Piano Sonata No. 2 in B flat Minor]] which contains the famous [[funeral march]]. A statue commemorating Rachmaninoff's last concert stands in the World's Fair Park in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]].

===Death===
[[Image:1 Sergei 800.jpg|thumb|The grave of Sergei Rachmaninoff in [[Kensico Cemetery]]]] Rachmaninoff died on [[March 28]], [[1943]], in [[Beverly Hills, California]], just a few days before his 70th birthday, and was interred on [[June 1]] in [[Kensico Cemetery]] in [[Valhalla, New York]].  In the final hours of his life, he insisted he could hear music playing somewhere nearby.  After being repeatedly assured that was not the case, he said:  "Then it is in my head".

== Works ==

:''See [[List of compositions by Sergei Rachmaninoff]] and [[:Category:Compositions by Sergei Rachmaninoff]]''

Rachmaninoff wrote five works for piano and orchestra: four concerti, and the [[Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini]].  Of the concerti, the [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Second]] and [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Third]] are the most popular, and are considered to be in the upper echelon of the virtuoso Romantic piano concerto literature.  The Third, in fact, is widely considered one of the most difficult of all piano concertos, and thus is a favorite among virtuoso pianists.
[[Image:Rachmaninov_hyperion.jpg|thumb|Rachmaninov playing the piano (from a Hyperion cover)]]
Works for piano solo include the [[Preludes (Rachmaninoff)|Preludes]], Opp. 23 and 32 which, together with the ''[[Prelude in C-sharp minor (Rachmaninoff)|Prelude in C-sharp minor]]'', Op. 3 No. 2, from ''[[Morceaux de Fantaisie (Rachmaninoff)|Morceaux de Fantaisie]]'', traverse all 24 major and minor keys. Especially difficult are the ''[[<U+00C9>tudes-Tableaux (Rachmaninoff)|<U+00C9>tudes-Tableaux]]'', which are literally very demanding ''study pictures''. There are also the ''[[Six Moments Musicaux|Moments Musicaux]]'', Op. 16, and the ''[[Variations on a Theme of Chopin (Rachmaninoff)|Variations on a Theme of Chopin]]'', Op. 22. He wrote two [[piano sonata]]s, both of which are monumental works and fine post-romantic examples of the genre.  Rachmaninoff also composed works for two pianos, four hands, including two Suites (the first subtitled ''Fantasie-Tableaux''), a version of ''Symphonic Dances'' Op. 45, and a ''Russian Rhapsody'' Op. posth.

Rachmaninoff wrote three symphonies, the [[Symphony No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)|first]] of which, in D minor, was a monumental failure. He tore up the score and for many years it was believed lost; however after his death, the orchestral parts were found in the Leningrad Conservatory and the score was reconstructed, leading to its second performance (and American premiere) on [[19 March]] [[1948]] at an all-Rachmaninoff concert marking the fifth anniversary of the composer's death.  The [[Symphony No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|second]] and [[Symphony No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|third]] are both considered among his greatest works. Other orchestral works include [[The Rock (Rachmaninoff)|The Rock]], ''[[Capriccio on Gypsy Themes (Rachmaninoff)|Capriccio on Gypsy Themes]]'', ''[[Isle of the Dead#The music|The Isle of the Dead]]'', and the ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]''. 

Rachmaninoff wrote two major ''[[a capella]]'' choral works: the ''[[Liturgy of St John Chrysostom]]'' and the ''[[All-Night Vigil]]'' (also known as the ''Vespers''). ''[[The Bells]]'', a work for choir and orchestra, is based on the translated poetry of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]; its four-movement program signifies the circle of life: youth, marriage, maturity, and death. The ''All-Night Vigil'' and ''The Bells'' are widely considered to be some of his finest works.

His chamber music includes two piano trios, which are named ''Trio El<U+00E9>giaque'', and a [[Cello Sonata (Rachmaninoff)|Cello Sonata]].  In his chamber music, the piano tends to be perceived by some to dominate the ensemble.

He completed three operas, being ''[[Aleko (opera)|Aleko]]'', ''[[The Miserly Knight]],'' and ''[[Francesca da Rimini]]''. He left unfinished ''Monna Vanna'', which was started in 1907, but did not see its first performance until 1984.

==Composition style==
Rachmaninoff's style is fundamentally Russian: his music shows the influence of the idol of his youth, [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]. His harmonic language expanded above and beyond that of Tchaikovsky, however. Rachmaninoff's frequently used motifs include the ''[[Dies Irae]]'', often just the fragments of the first phrase: this is especially prevalent in ''The Bells'', ''The Isle of the Dead'', the ''Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini'', and in all three Symphonies. The Second Symphony, in particular, has a marvelous and little known occurrence of the ''Dies Irae'': in the second movement he uses it as the basis for the harmony in counterpoint to one of his archetypal soaring melodies.

Also especially important is the use of bell-like sounds: this occurs in many pieces, most notably in the cantata ''The Bells'', the ''Second Piano Concerto'' and the B minor prelude. He was also fond of Russian Orthodox chants. He uses them most obviously in his Vespers, but many of his melodies found their origins in these chants. The opening melodies of the First Symphony is derived from chants. (Note that the opening melody of the Third Piano Concerto is not derived from chants, which is a misconception many musicians have in mind. Rachmaninoff, when asked, said that it had written itself.)

In scherzo-like movements, he often used a modified [[rondo]] form, usually opening with a light, swift rhythmical idea, then supplying a breath of fresh air in the form of a beautifully romantic melody, to then end the piece in a similar scherzo-fashion. Examples of this may be found in the last movement of the Second Concerto, the scherzo of the Cello Sonata, and the scherzo of the Second Symphony. He also frequently employed the fugue as a developmental device.

Rachmaninoff had great command of [[counterpoint]] and [[fugue|fugal]] writing. The above-mentioned occurrence of the ''Dies Irae'' in the Second Symphony is but a small example of this. Very characteristic of his writing is [[chromatic scale|chromatic]] counterpoint. 

His later works, such as the [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 4]] (Op. 40, 1926) and the ''[[Variations on a Theme of Corelli]]'' (Op. 42, 1931), are composed in a more emotionally detached style, making them less popular with audiences despite the striking originality of the music.  In these later compositions, Rachmaninoff sought a greater sense of compression and motivic development in his works at the expense of [[melody]]. Nevertheless, some of his most beautiful (nostalgic and melancholy) melodies occur in the [[Symphony No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Third Symphony]], [[Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini|Paganini Rhapsody]], and [[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]], the last-named of which is considered his [[swan song]], and which has references to the ''Alliluya'' of the Vespers and the first theme of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)|First Symphony]] (neither of which would have been recognized by most hearers at the premiere).

== Pianism ==
Rachmaninoff's pianism is generally considered among the finest of the twentieth century.  It displayed features characteristic of the Russian school of piano playing: effortless technical ability; interpretative freedom that is now frowned on; creative freedom in dynamics and phrasing.  

=== Recordings on shellac and paper rolls ===
Rachmaninoff made his first recordings for [[Edison Records]] on their "Diamond Disc" records, since they claimed the best [[audio fidelity]] in recording the [[piano]] at the time. Rachmaninoff did not consider himself a great pianist and believed his own performances to be variable in quality; he therefore requested to personally approve any recorded performances to be commercially issued. Despite this, the Edison Company issued multiple alternative takes of Rachmaninoff's recordings, a common occurrence in the [[gramophone record]] industry at the time, possibly for reasons of simple carelessness or because of the ease of mass production of records from multiple masters.

Rachmaninoff was so angered by this that he left Edison and subsequently started recording for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] (in 1920) and its successor, [[RCA|RCA Victor]]. The company was pleased to abide by Rachmaninoff's restrictions, and proudly advertised him as one of the great artists who recorded for the Victor Company. Rachmaninoff also made a number of [[piano rolls]]; initially disbelieving that a roll of punched paper could provide an accurate record, he was invited to listen to a master roll of his first recording in 1919 for the [[Ampico]] company.  After the performance, he was quoted as saying ''"Gentlemen &mdash; I, Sergei Rachmaninoff, have just heard myself play!"''  He continued to record for [[Ampico]] until around 1929.

=== Gramophone recordings ===
Many of Rachmaninoff's recordings are acknowledged as classics.  Particularly renowned are his renditions of [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'' and [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s ''[[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|Funeral March Sonata]]'', which many consider the finest performance of that work, along with many shorter pieces.  He recorded all four of his piano concertos with the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], including two versions of the second concerto with [[Leopold Stokowski]] conducting, and a world premiere recording of the ''Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini'', soon after the first performance (1934) with the Philadelphians under Stokowski.  The first, third, and fourth concertos were recorded with [[Eugene Ormandy]].

Rachmaninoff wanted to record several other major piano works, including [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|Waldstein Sonata]]'', [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s ''[[Piano Sonata (Liszt)|Sonata in B minor]]'' and his own ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'' in a two-piano collaboration with [[Vladimir Horowitz]], but RCA turned him down.  He also wanted to record his second symphony; instead Ormandy recorded it in an abridged version that was used for many years.  (Ormandy finally recorded the uncut second symphony in 1973 for RCA Victor.)

Rachmaninoff also made three greatly admired recordings as a conductor with the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], including his own ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Third Symphony]]'', his symphonic poem ''[[Isle of the Dead]]'', and an abbreviated version of his ''[[Vocalise]]''.

His final recordings were made for RCA Victor in February 1942; a Musicians Union recording ban prevented him from making further recordings before his death the following year.

Whenever Rachmaninoff played in a concert that was broadcast, he specifically requested that one of his recordings be played instead by the station or network.  However, at least one private recording of him playing in public has survived and was included by RCA Victor in its boxed set of his complete recordings (1919-42), released in 1973 on LP and later reissued on CD.<ref>RCA Victor liner notes</ref>
