'''Ellen Amanda Hayes''' (September 23, 1851<U+2013>October 27, 1930) was an American mathematician and astronomer. Born in [[Granville, Ohio]], she graduated from [[Oberlin College]] in 1878 and began teaching at [[Adrian College]].  From 1879 to her 1916 retirement, she taught at [[Wellesley College]], where she became head of the mathematics department in 1888 and head of the new department in [[applied mathematics]] in 1897.<ref>Grinstein and Campbell, 63</ref>  Hayes was also active in [[astronomy]], determining the orbit of newly-discovered [[267 Tirza]] while studying at the [[Leander McCormick Observatory]] at the [[University of Virginia]].<ref>Grinstein and Campbell, 65</ref>

Hayes wrote a number of mathematics textbooks.  She also wrote ''Wild Turkeys and Tallow Candles'' (1920), an account of life in Granville, and ''The Sycamore Trail'' (1929), a historical novel.<ref>http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/hayes.htm</ref>

Hayes was a controversial figure not just for being a rare female mathematics professor in 19th century America, but for her embrace of radical causes like questioning the Bible and gender clothing conventions, [[suffrage]], [[temperance]], [[socialism]], the [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike]], and [[Sacco and Vanzetti]]. She was the [[Socialist Party USA|Socialist Party]] candidate for [[Massachusetts Secretary of State]] in 1912, the first woman in state history to run for statewide office. She did not win the race, but did receive more votes than any Socialist candidate on the ballot, including 2500 more than their gubernatorial candidate.<ref>Grinstein and Campbell, 64</ref>

Her will left her brain to the [[Wilder Brain Collection]] at [[Cornell University]].  Her ashes were buried in Granville, Ohio.<ref>Grinstein and Campbell, 64</ref>
