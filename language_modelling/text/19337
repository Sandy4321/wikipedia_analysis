'''Baharna Arabic''' also known as '''Baharnah''' and '''Bahrani Arabic''') is a [[Varieties of Arabic|variety]] of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] spoken by the [[Bahrani]]s of [[Bahrain]] and some parts of [[Saudi Eastern Province]], and also in [[Oman]].

In Bahrain, the dialect is spoken in the capital, [[Manama]], and in Bahrani villages.  Others speak a [[Gulf Arabic|Gulf dialect]] which is more similar to those spoken in [[Kuwait]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]].

In Saudi Arabia, [[Qatif]] and neighbouring towns and villages are the main center of the dialect.  These are distinct from the dialects of [[Al-Hasa]], the other major population center in the Eastern Province.

The differences between Bahrani Arabic and neighboring dialects suggest differing historical origins.  Most of the others in the region are relatively recent immigrants, many of them originally [[Bedouin]] Najdi tribes.  Those now speak Gulf dialects which are very distinct from Najdi and Bedouin dialects, and which are much more similar to the Bahrani dialects.  In Bahrain, the main differences between Bahrani speech and others' speech are evident certain grammatical forms and especially pronunciation and accent.  Most of the vocabulary, however, is shared between both dialects and distinctly Bahraini, arising from a shared modern history.  Many Bahrani words were borrowed from Hindi or English.

=== Words borrowed from other languages ===

* ''b<U+0101>nka'' 'ceiling fan' 
* ''s<U+014D>m<U+0101>n'' 'equipment' from [[Hindi]].
* ''l<U+0113>tar'' 'lighter' from [[English language|English]].
* ''w<U+012B>l'' 'wheel' from [[English language|English]]
* ''t<U+0113>m'' 'time' from [[English language|English]]
* ''dareesha'' '' from [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]
* ''dowshag'' from [[Persian language|Persian]]

Bahrani dialect has borrowed some vocabulary from [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Hindi]] and more recently from [[English language|English]].  Despite commercial and cultural intercourse with Persia in the past, the Persian element is relatively very small and is concerned mainly with novelties introduced from Persia.

== Features ==

Bahrani Arabic (called ''Ba<U+0127>r<U+0101>ni'' by its speakers) has the main features of [[Gulf Arabic|gulf Arabic dialects]] (e.g. Kuwait, UAE, Qatar) in addition to its own unique features.  General features include Standard Arabic ''q'' becoming ''g'' (''qamar'' vs ''gamar'' 'moon'), ''k'' becoming ''ch'' in some positions (''kalb'' vs ''chalb'' 'dog').  ''J'' becomes ''y'' in some villages (''ji<U+0127><U+0127>e'' vs ''yi<U+0127><U+0127>e'' 'watermelon').  Final Standard Arabic -ah becomes -e in some positions.
Unique features include changing th and dh into f and d.Many younger speakers avoid such pronunciations, however.

Bahrani grammar is similar to other Gulf dialects but includes the distinctive 'ee' sound that is used at the end of sentences to indicate a [[tag question]] it means yes , e.g.:
*''Ente r<U+0101>ye<U+0127>, ee?'' You are going, yes?
