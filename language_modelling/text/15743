==Early life==
Bavetta was born in Brooklyn, New York on December 10, 1939. His father was an officer for the [[New York Police Department]] and his mother was a homemaker.<ref name="biography"/> Bavetta attended [[Power Memorial Academy]] in New York City (the same school future NBA star [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] attended) and is a 1962 graduate of [[St. Francis College]] in New York<ref name="bio" /> and played on the schools' basketball teams.<ref name="USAToday">{{cite news |title=Bavetta proves he's officially capable |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2004-02-19-bavetta_x.htm |last=DuPree |first=David |publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' |date=February 19, 2004 |accessdate=July 28, 2007}}</ref> He began officiating after his brother, Joe, who officiated for the American Basketball Association, convinced him that it would be an interesting career.<ref name="USAToday" />  A [[Wall Street]] [[broker]] for [[Salomon Brothers]] with an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] in finance, Bavetta began officiating games between fellow brokers in the Wall Street League, played at New York's Downtown Athletic Club, and later worked high school games.<ref name="USAToday" />  For ten years, he officiated Public and Catholic High School leagues in New York and later nine years in the Eastern Professional Basketball League, which later became the [[Continental Basketball Association]].<ref name="bio" />

==NBA officiating career==
In mid-1960s, he began to attend regional referee tryouts in the hopes of becoming an NBA referee; however, he was rejected for nine straight years due to his small physique and unimposing size.<ref name="biography"/> Bavetta was finally hired by the NBA in 1975 following the retirement of [[Mendy Rudolph]].<ref name="Sheridan" /> He debuted December 2, 1975 at [[Madison Square Garden]] in an NBA game between the [[New York Knicks]] and the [[Boston Celtics]]. His first ten years in the league were tough as he was constantly ranked bottom among NBA referees in performance evaluations and led the league in technical fouls and ejections called.<ref name="biography"/>

To improve his officiating, Bavetta refereed games for the New Jersey pro league and [[Rucker League]] in [[Harlem]] during the off-seasons and studied NBA rulebooks. In 1983, he became the first referee to undergo rigorous physical trainings. He ran six to eight miles and took three-hour naps everyday. His effort paid off when he emerged as one of the best referees.<ref name="biography"/> In the 1980s, he was named chief referee, who has the power to approve or overrule calls made by other officials. He was assigned to officiate his first playoff game in 1986.<ref name="biography"/>

Bavetta's most memorable game occurred during a 1980s nationally televised contest between the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] and Boston Celtics when he was forced to officiate an NBA game by himself after his partner, [[Jack Madden]], broke his leg in a collision with Celtics [[Guard (basketball)|guard]] [[Dennis Johnson]].<ref name="NBRAnews" /><ref name="Nance">{{cite news |title=Whistle-blower Bavetta shows no signs of slowing |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2006-02-07-bavetta-questions_x.htm |last=Nance |first=Roscoe |work=[[USA Today]] |date=February 7, 2006 |accessdate=July 29, 2007}}</ref>  At one point in the game, Celtics [[Forward (basketball)|forward]] [[Larry Bird]] and 76ers guard [[Julius Erving]] began to strangle each other and were ejected by Bavetta.<ref name="NBRAnews" />  Bavetta believed that this game assisted in the progression of his career in the NBA.<ref name="Nance" />

From 1990 to 2000, Bavetta regularly refereed playoff games and was ranked at the top among referees in terms of performance evaluation. In 2000, he was one of the highest-paid referees in the NBA, earning over $200,000 a year.<ref name="biography"/> Bavetta's career was threatened when he was accidentally hit in the nose by Pacers forward [[Jalen Rose]], who was trying to punch Knicks center [[Patrick Ewing]] during a 1999 game between the [[Indiana Pacers]] and the  New York Knicks. Bavetta did not leave the game immediately, opting to wait until later in the day to have surgery. He returned the next day to officiate a [[New Jersey Nets]] game.<ref name="biography"/>

On February 8, 2006, Bavetta officiated his 2,135th NBA game, setting a league record for most games officiated that was previously held by [[Jake O'Donnell]].<ref name="Sheridan" />  Bavetta said the secret to his longevity was "wearing five pairs of socks", which he claims helped keep his feet in good shape.<ref name="Sheridan" />  Contributing to his good health, Bavetta says he runs five to eight miles every day.<ref name="Sheridan">{{cite news |title=At 66, Bavetta to break record for most games refereed |url=http://insider.espn.go.com/nba/insider/columns/story?columnist=sheridan_chris&id=2322757&lpos=spotlight&lid=tab3pos1&action=login&appRedirect=http%3a%2f%2finsider.espn.go.com%2fnba%2finsider%2fcolumns%2fstory%3fcolumnist%3dsheridan_chris%26id%3d2322757%26lpos%3dspotlight%26lid%3dtab3pos1 |last=Sheridan |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Sheridan (sportswriter) |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |date=February 9, 2006 |accessdate=July 28, 2007}}</ref>  For his longevity in the league, he has received the nickname "the [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] of referees".<ref name="biography"/>

During the [[2006<U+2013>07 NBA season|2006<U+2013>07 season]], Bavetta officiated a December 16, 2006 game between the New York Knicks and [[Denver Nuggets]]. The game involved a [[Knicks<U+2013>Nuggets brawl|brawl]] where all ten players on the court were ejected by Bavetta and his officiating crew.<ref name="boxscore">{{cite news |title=Nuggets, Knicks in wild free-for-all; 10 players tossed |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=261216018 |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=December 16, 2006 |accessdate=July 28, 2007}}</ref>  The league eventually suspended seven players for a total of 47 games and fined both teams $500,000.<ref name="suspension">{{cite news |title=Suspensions total 47 games from Knicks-Nuggets fight |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2701228 |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |date=December 20, 2006 |accessdate=July 28, 2007}}</ref>

===Charitable works===
Bavetta is also actively involved in charitable works. He has established and financed the Lady Bavetta Scholarships since 1986 in honor of his daughters, awarded to high school minority children based on their needs.<ref name="USAToday"/><ref>{{cite web |title=NBA 2008<U+2013>09 Officials Media Guide |url=http://www.nba.com/media/2008-09-RefereeGuide.pdf |publisher=[[NBA.com]] |accessdate=May 24, 2009 |format=PDF}}</ref> He has volunteered since 1992 with Double H-Hole in the Woods Ranch working with children with cancer and HIV. He also works with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and serves as the Upstate New York Regional Director for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.<ref name="bio"/>

During the [[2007 NBA All-Star Weekend]], Bavetta raced [[Turner Network Television]] (TNT) studio analyst and former NBA player [[Charles Barkley]] for a $75,000 charitable donation ($50,000 contributed by the NBA and $25,000 by TNT) to the [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas, Nevada]] [[Boys & Girls Clubs of America]],<ref name="Runners">{{cite web |title=I'm a Runner: Dick Bavetta |url=http://www.runnersworld.com/article/printer/1,7124,s6-243-297--11839-0,00.html |last=Butler |first=Sarah Lorge |publisher=''[[Runner's World]]'' |accessdate=July 29, 2007}}</ref> but lost by a narrow margin.<ref name="race">{{cite news |title=Barkley's race with 67-year-old ref steals show on All-Star Saturday |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/allstar/2007-02-17-saturday-competitions_x.htm |last=Dixon |first=Oscar |publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' |date=February 19, 2007 |accessdate=July 29, 2007}}</ref>  The distance of the race was three and one half full lengths of the court<ref name="race" /> (or 329&nbsp;feet).  Bavetta lost the race despite a last-second dive and Barkley running the last portion of the race backwards.<ref name="race" />  The dive resulted in an abrasion injury to Bavetta's right knee.<ref name="2007AllStar" />

==Controversies==
===Altercations with Earl Strom===
According to [[Darryl Dawkins]]'s autobiography, Bavetta was officiating an NBA game during the mid-1970s between the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] and [[New Jersey Nets]] with [[Earl Strom]] as his partner for that game.<ref name="Dawkins">{{cite web |title=The big dunk |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/dawkins/030520.html |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |accessdate=June 10, 2007}}</ref>  Bavetta overruled Strom on a crucial last-second [[Personal foul (basketball)|personal foul]] call against the Nets, which would have been a victory for the 76ers.<ref name="Dawkins" />  When the game ended and players were walking to their respective locker rooms, the door to the referees' locker room flew open and Bavetta came staggering out.<ref name="Dawkins" />  His uniform was allegedly ripped and he was wearing a big welt over his eye, running to get away from Strom.<ref name="Dawkins" />  Strom stepped out into the hallway and hollered after Bavetta, "You'll take another one of my fucking calls again, right, you motherfucker?"<ref name="Dawkins" /> Strom was later fined for the incident.<ref name="Jake">{{cite web |title=Did NBA give Jake a fair shake? |url=http://cbs.sportsline.com/b/page/pressbox/blineburyf121395.htm |last=Blinebury |first=Fran |publisher=[[CBS SportsLine.com]] |date=December 13, 1995 |accessdate=June 10, 2007}}</ref>

Bavetta had another altercation with Strom when he choked him during halftime of an NBA game in 1989 for allegedly siding with the home crowd. Strom reportedly apologized two weeks later.<ref name="biography"/>

===Allegation of game fixing===
Bavetta was one of three referees for the Game 6 of the [[2002 NBA Playoffs|2002 Western Conference Finals]] between [[Sacramento Kings]] and the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Former referee [[Tim Donaghy]] has alleged that at least one of the referees working this game had subjective motives for wanting the Lakers to defeat the Kings, and made officiating calls to effectuate this outcome.<ref name="refallegations">{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3436401|title=2002 Lakers-Kings Game 6 at heart of Donaghy allegations|date=June 11, 2008|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=April 21, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3437716|title=Delaney: NBA, feds have not contacted me about claim|date=June 12, 2008|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=May 22, 2009}}</ref> The NBA has not permitted Bavetta to speak publicly regarding the incident, though ''The New York Times'' reported on June 12, 2008 that the FBI is investigating allegations that Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference finals had been manipulated to further the series to a seventh game.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/12/sports/basketball/12refs.html|title=The Gravity of Donaghy<U+2019>s Accusations Is Unclear|date=June 12, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=May 22, 2009|first=Howard|last=Beck}}</ref>
