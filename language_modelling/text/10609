Perceptor ('''Percepto''' in [[France]], '''Supervista''' in [[Italy]]) transforms into a [[microscope]] (which also functions as a [[telescope]]). 

Perceptor is a scientist, one of the most brilliant minds the whole of Cybertron can offer. He is always looking to learn more, and his discoveries have proven invaluable time and time again. Though his specialties lie in metallurgy, electrical engineering, and other sciences closely related to Transformer physiology, his thirst for knowledge has made him kind of a scientific jack-of-all-trades. 

According to the voice actor Paul Eiding, Perceptor was voiced with inspiration from [[C-3PO]] and [[The Absent-Minded Professor]] with a British accent. The long, hard part of Perceptor sticks up, protruding conspicuously from its head. <ref>http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-news/interviews-27/tfw2005-interviews-generation-1-perceptor-paul-eiding-168579/</ref>

===Marvel Comics===
<!--  Commented out: [[Image:Circuitbreaker-autobots.jpg|right|thumb|Circuit Breaker leads a giant Autobot she created from parts of other Autobots against the Decepticon Battlechargers in Marvel's Transformers comics.]] -->

Perceptor was originally part of an Autobot group in the "Dead End" region of Cybertron. Serving as the group's scientist, Perceptor would nonetheless lead a mission to save the captured [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]] from being executed by the local Decepticon commander [[Straxus|Lord Straxus]]. Later, he was opposed to the plan to save the captive scientist Spanner, but was outvoted. Accompanying the others to blow up the Decepticon base, they were horrified to discover that the Decepticons had built Spanner into the Space Bridge itself. Destroying the Bridge as a mercy-killing, Perceptor and his comrades ([[Beachcomber (Transformers)|Beachcomber]], Blaster, [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]], [[Powerglide (Transformers)|Powerglide]], [[Seaspray (Transformers)|Seaspray]] and [[Warpath (Transformers)|Warpath]]), with no chance of escaping to Cybertron, crossed the bridge to Earth.

After an attack by [[Megatron]], they were then captured by [[Circuit Breaker (Transformers)|Circuit Breaker]] and her [[Rapid Anti-Robot Attack Team]], taken to her lab and then dissected. After capturing the [[Aerialbots]] she encountered a new problem - the Decepticon [[Battlechargers]] [[Runabout (Transformers)|Runabout]] and [[Runamuck (Transformers)|Runamuck]] were causing mayhem across America. Using the parts from all the captured Autobots she created a giant Autobot with herself in control, striking a deal with them that if they would co-operate she would let them go. Circuit Breaker then used them to battle the two Decepticons, who were attacking the [[Statue of Liberty]]. After defeating the Decepticons with Circuit Breaker the Autobots were released.

After a side-adventure in the U.K. comics in which they encountered (and were almost killed by) the future Decepticon [[Galvatron]], Perceptor's group linked up with the main Autobots - only to learn of the death of [[Optimus Prime]]. 

In issue #27, "King of the Hill!", Perceptor summoned his fellow Autobots [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]], [[Hot Spot (Transformers)|Hot Spot]], [[Jetfire]], [[Omega Supreme]], [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] and [[Silverbolt]] in order to decide who should take leadership of the Autobots. After an attack by the giant Decepticon [[Trypticon]] the leader was chosen - [[Grimlock]]. 

He soon regretted this, as Grimlock became more and more tyrannical. After Blaster returned (having gone rogue over Grimlock's leadership) Perceptor was one of those who welcomed him back. 

After Prime's return as a [[Powermaster]], Perceptor continued to serve loyally, battling the Decepticons in the [[Arctic]] and getting jumped by the [[Seacons]] in the process. Perceptor was deactivated when Starscream blew up the Decepticon island ship with Perceptor aboard in Transformers #50.

Perceptor's body was seen among the deactivated Autobots Ratchet was doing his best to revive in Transformers #56, "Back from the Dead".

The future movie continuity also appeared in the "Space Pirates" arc of the UK comic, where he was defeated in the Quintesson attack on Autobot City.

Perceptor would appear in the [[Transformers: Generation 2]] comics as one of the Autobot scientists studying the victims of the [[Swarm (Transformers)|Swarm]], indicating he was revived by [[Nucleon (Transformers)|Nucleon]] at some point.

===Animated series===
[[Image:PerceptorProfile.jpg|left|thumb|Perceptor in robot mode.]]
Perceptor made his first appearance in "Dinobot Island Part 2" when he assisted Chip Chase at understanding some unusual phenomena occurring in that episode. 

His first major role is in "Microbots" when Megatron acquired ''the Heart of Cybertron'', which was decimating the Autobots. He used his shrinking device to shrink himself, [[Bumblebee (Transformer)|Bumblebee]] and [[Brawn (Transformers)|Brawn]], so they could infiltrate Megatron's body and disable ''the Heart of Cybertron'', which he later destroyed.

In the episode "The God Gambit" [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]] collected data in space on a potential new power source, but was attacked by [[Astrotrain]], [[Thrust (Transformers)|Thrust]] and [[Starscream]]. Crashing on the moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], the local priests worshiped the Decepticons as "''Sky Gods''", but rebels were able to reactivate Cosmos and call for aid from the Autobots. [[Optimus Prime]] sent [[Omega Supreme]] with Perceptor and [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]]. Astrotrain set himself up as the chief god of the moon and forced the natives to gather energy crystals. The trip to Titan drained Omega of most of his energy, but Perceptor and Jazz were able to gather enough crystals to reactivate Omega and defeat the three Decepticons. Vowing to not let the Autobots gain the crystals, Astrotrain set up a chain reaction destroying them. The Autobots aided the natives to escape the explosion and helped them settle in another area of the moon.
Perceptor appeared in "Cosmic Rust", using a special rust-proof formula on the Statue of Liberty. He was kidnapped by Decepticons to treat Megatron's hideous rusting. He diagnoses it as "Cosmic Rust", and uses some of the formula on Megatron. He himself was also infected, as well as all the Autobots. He and Wheeljack got the Matter Duplicator to duplicate the rust-proof formula, as the key ingredient was extinct. With this, the cosmic rust was gone, and the Autobots were saved.

Perceptor would continue to appear throughout season 3, acting as [[Rodimus Prime]]'s scientific advisor. Perceptor was one of the pre-1986 Autobots to survive [[The Transformers: The Movie]], along with [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]], [[Cliffjumper]], [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]], [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]], [[Warpath (Transformers)|Warpath]], [[Powerglide (Transformers)|Powerglide]], the [[Aerialbots]],and the [[Dinobots]]. His role as chief Autobot scientist meant he could be used instead of either [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] and [[Wheeljack]], whose toys were being discontinued; both were killed off in Transformers: The Movie.

In episode 78, "Madman's Paradise", Spike and Carly hosted a banquet for a visiting ambassador. Daniel got bored and wandered off. [[Grimlock]] followed him, and they fell into a lost chamber where Quintessons banished their criminals to other dimensions. They slipped through to the sorcerous other-dimensional realm of Menonia, and were tricked into fighting on the [[Red Wizard (Transformers)|Red Wizard]]'s side, only to find out that he was the Quintesson criminal, who overthrew the [[Golden One]]. [[Ultra Magnus]], [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]], [[Eject (Transformers)|Eject]], Rewind, [[Ramhorn]], and [[Steeljaw]] followed, and using Blaster's amplification, they help the Golden One defeat the Red Wizard. With the help of Perceptor, the Autobots and Daniel are returned to Cybertron.

Perceptor last appeared in episode 93, "The Face of Ninjika". Battling over a Quadrant Lock Disc, Autobot, Decepticon, and Quintesson forces cross a rip in space and become trapped there, landing on the planet Zimojin. An inhabitant named Katsudan removes Perceptor's Autobot sigil and uses it as the head and face for an ancient robot named Ninjika, explaining it resembles the missing face of this broken defender. 

Perceptor made an appearance in 1989, in Transformers: Victory in Japan. [[Wheeljack]], along with Perceptor and [[Minerva (Transformers)|Minerva]] were called upon to save God [[Ginrai]], who they converted into Victory Leo.

===Fun Publications===
[[Image:perceptor-fp.jpg|left|thumb|Classic Perceptor]]
Based on the Transformers Classics toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story (ignoring all events of the Marvel U.K. and ''Generation 2'' comics). 

Although Perceptor has yet to be depicted in the comics, he did have a toy made for the line, which was the basis for his form when he appeared in the Classicverse Lithograph sold of BotCon 2007.  

In the story "Games of Decepticon" Springer uses a jamming device given to him by Perceptor to disrupt the Cerebro Shells used by [[Bugbite]] to control the Decepticons.

===Dreamwave Productions===
Perceptor would make his first chronological appearance in the third volume of ''The War Within'', as an Autobot scientist supporting the peace between the Autobots, Decepticons and [[Ultracons]]. [[Megatron]]'s return with a massive army of Seeker clones forced Perceptor to seek a desperate solution - locating the missing Optimus Prime. Recruiting the [[Turbomaster]]s, Perceptor hoped to use his equipment to find where Optimus had been transported to - but Flash interfered with it and was transported instead. Dreamwave's closure would prevent this story from being finished.

Later, he appeared in the second volume of the Generation One series as part of an Autobot resistance movement opposed to [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]]. He appears pleading with the Cybertronian Council to investigate Shockwave's modifications to other Transformers, but would later join Prime's attack on Iacon.

===Devil's Due Publishing===
[[Image:Gijoe-transformers.jpg|right|thumb|Transformers Perceptor, [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Grimlock]] and [[Arcee]] meet [[G.I. Joe]] in the pages of Devil's Due comics crossover between the two popular series.]]

Perceptor featured in the second G.I. Joe vs the Transformers tale from [[Devil's Due Publishing]], as one of the resistance group under [[Ultra Magnus]].

Perceptor returned in the third series of G.I. Joe vs. The Transformers. Grimlock, Arcee, Bumblebee and Perceptor were sent to Earth to aid G.I. Joe in removing the influence of Cybertonian technology on the planet. Several of the Joes, such as [[Snake-Eyes]], [[Hawk (G.I. Joe)|Hawk]] and [[Roadblock (G.I. Joe)|Roadblock]], end up piloting large, human-like robots themselves. When Cobra attacks the Joe base, the Autobots helped repel the Cobra Battle Android Trooper armies. An investigation reveals a secret facillity literally beneath the Joe's own HQ. Megatron's head is found, inactive and on the floor. Perceptor is enraged, believing Hawk had violated their agreement by messing around with Cybertronian technology. He is soon convinced that Hawk did not know this was happening. The existence of  the facillity's project, Serpentor, is discovered. A robot himself, smaller than the ones the Joe's pilot, he has the ability to take over mechanical systems with coils. Though the Transformer technology gives him trouble, all of the Joe's mechas are corrupted. Perceptor ends up personally battling [[Scarlett (G.I. Joe)|Scarlett's]] mecha, though she is not in it. Serpentor soon literally buries the entire team in rubble, leaving to conquer Cybertron.

Pursuing Serpentor to Cybertron (and unable to convince Hawk to stay behind) the group were quickly captured by Serpentor's new army, but were freed by [[Snake-Eyes]] and Scarlett. Wounded by the [[Cobra Commander]] possessed Serpentor, Perceptor later recovers, laughing at Roadblock tales.

===3H Enterprises===
Perceptor appeared in a flashback scene in issue #2 of the Transformers: Universe - Wreckers comic, where Rodimus Prime consulted Quickmix, Skids, Perceptor and Rad on his plans to send out ships to gather information on threats from space after the defeat of Unicron.

===IDW Publishing===
Perceptor made his first [[IDW Publishing]] appearance in ''[[The Transformers: Spotlight|Spotlight]]'' issue on [[Kup]], as the head of a team aboard the [[Ark (Transformers)|Ark-17]] trying to rescue the veteran Autobot. However, the radiation filled surroundings and Kup's madness led to the failure of all rescue attempts. Perceptor then attempted to reason with [[Springer (Transformers)|Springer]], agreeing with [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]] that it was a waste of lives and resources - until [[Trailbreaker]] arrived.

Perceptor was on the Autobot Orbital Command Hub in ''Spotlight: Blaster''. He was present when Blaster was recovered and returned to the Autobots.

===Toys===
*'''Generation 1 Perceptor''' (1985)
:Based on a black Microman toy, but in red as an Autobot. The toy version of Perceptor actually contained a magnifying lens and could be used as a small, low-powered microscope.

The name Perceptor reappeared in the ''Transformers: Armada'' line, this time as the name of a [[Mini-Con]] combiner formed from the members of the [[Street Action Team]].

Perceptor's bio told how the three beings that make up Perceptor - Grindor, High Wire and Sureshock - are, despite the war raging over them, unflaggingly, unfailingly positive. They try to help all those they meet, and it is this common unity that explains why they work so well together as Perceptor. It stands as a symbol of Mini-Con unity, battling the Decepticons on their own terms, with their unbelievable coordination giving them an edge. However, this comes at a price - [[Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)|Megatron]] desires their abilities, and will stop at nothing to possess them.

====Dreamwave Productions====
In the Energon comic series by Dreamwave comics Perceptor appeared in issues 27-29 of the series. He originally appeared as part of the Autobot reinforcements under [[Jetfire]] who headed to Earth to fend off the [[Terrorcon]] invasion. Perceptor was part of the team who travelled to [[Los Angeles]] to battle the [[Insecticons|Insecticon]] clones, alongside [[Landquake]], [[Cliffjumper]], [[Bulkhead (Transformers)|Bulkhead]] and [[Tow-Line]]. They were in danger of being overwhelmed by the sheer number of clones until they were rescued by a surprising source - [[Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)|Megatron]], resurrected in a new body by [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]]. Megatron decimated the Insecticon clones, leaving the Autobots to help with the devastation.

===IDW Publishing===
Perceptor appeared in IDW's Transformers Collectors Club exclusive comic story, set during the events of [[Transformers: Cybertron]]. He appeared as one of the Mini-Cons loyal to the Mini-Con council, battling the rebel forces of [[Thrust (Transformers)|Thrust]] and [[Sunstorm (Transformers)|Sunstorm]]. However, when [[Unicron]] attacked Cybertron once again, Perceptor was one of those who battled [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], forcing him to flee. However in ''Revelations part 6'', [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]] returned to Cybertron, bearing word of [[Vector Prime (Transformers)|Vector Prime]]'s death in battle. Perceptor was amongst those that mourned his loss.

===Toys===
*'''''Armada'' Perceptor'''

[[Image:Perceptor-universe.jpg|left|thumb|''Universe'' Perceptor]]
*'''''Universe'' Perceptor''' (2004)
:Armada Perceptor would be re-released in the Universe line in darker colors packaged alongside Universe [[Sunstorm (Transformers)|Sunstorm]] and [[Inferno (Transformers)|Inferno]]. His only appearance in the Transformers: Universe storyline was as one of the Decepticons under the command of [[Reptilion]] in the Botcon 2004 voice actor play.  He battled [[Silverbolt (Beast Wars and Beast Machines)|Silverbolt]], [[Rattrap (Transformers)|Rattrap]] and [[Waspinator]] in order to secure two groups of dimensionally displaced Autobots from the [[Transformers: Robots in Disguise|RiD]] universe. However, the three groups of Autobots, together with a time-lost Autobot shuttle from the Great War, were able to defeat the Decepticons.

*'''''Energon'' Perceptor''' (2004)
:''Armada'' Perceptor (now called Cliffjumper in Japan) returned with a completely new mold for ''Energon''.
:His bio now indicated that while he had gained the admiration and respect of his comrades as a warrior, his greatest desire was to spend time with his human friends ([[Rad (Transformers)|Rad]], Alexis, Carlos and especially [[Kicker (Transformers)|Kicker]]) to learn as much as he could about Earth, its people and its culture. However, he will still battle against the odds to defend it from the Decepticons.
:In late 2005 Energon Perceptor was repackaged for the ''Transformers: Universe'' line. The toy was identical to the Energon version. This character has not appeared in any Universe story yet.

*'''''Cybertron'' Perceptor''' (2006)
:Perceptor is a recolor of the ''Energon'' toy and does not appear in the TV cartoon series.  The three members of the Street Action Team are now part of the Mini-Con 'versus' packs and were sold individually along with a member of the Decepticon Mini-Con [[Deep Space Team]].  Although each Mini-Con has a bio on their package; Perceptor, being a combined form, does not.  He is described as the most powerful warrior among the Mini-Cons and the only one to defeat their Decepticon rivals.

Perceptor was recently confirmed for the third season by show artist Derrick J Wyatt.  His appearance is very G1-based although he now has a large cranium, what appear to be glasses, and has very scrawny limbs. A leaked model sheet revealed that his vehicle mode is that of a pick-up truck, the rear of which can transform into a mini-laboratory.

Unlike all of the other characters in the series, Perceptor is voiced by a computer through [[Speech synthesis]].

===Animated series===
In the episode "Transwarped" it was revealed that he was the one who built [[Omega Supreme]]. He next appeared in "Decepticon Air", unsuccessfully trying to convince [[Sentinel Prime]] not to take command of the Autobots following [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave's]] attack on [[Ultra Magnus]]. He also appeared in "This is Why I Hate Machines", protesting against Sentinel's extreme suggestion to fire on a Decepticon-controlled Omega Supreme.
