'''Tomomi Tsuruta''' ([[March 25]], [[1951]] - [[May 13]], [[2000]]), better known by his [[ring name]] '''Jumbo Tsuruta''', was a professional wrestler who wrestled for [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] for most of his career.

== Career ==

Tsuruta was very athletic, participating in [[swimming]], [[basketball]], and [[sumo]] while attending Hikawa Senior High School in Yamanashi-shi, Yamanashi Prefecture.  While at [[Chuo University]], he began an [[amateur wrestling]] career. He adapted to the business quickly, having classic matches in the first few years of his career. He won the [[All Japan Amateur Wrestling Championship]] in [[freestyle wrestling|freestyle]] and [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] as a [[superheavyweight]] (at the time, an unlimited class for those weighing over 100 [[kilograms]]) in the years [[1971]] and [[1972]].  He also competed in the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]].  Scouted by AJPW promoter [[Shohei Baba|Giant Baba]], he was sent to the local [[Amarillo, Texas]] promotion in the U.S. to train as a pro under [[Dory Funk Jr.]] The name "Jumbo" was given to him by a fan contest in Japan to replace his given name, which was seen as too [[Femininity|feminine]].

During his 26 year career, he fought in 3,329 matches. He fought [[Stan Hansen]], [[Dick Beyer|The Destroyer]], [[Bruiser Brody]], [[Genichiro Tenryu]], [[Terry Funk]], [[Dory Funk Jr.]], and [[Mitsuharu Misawa]].  He also fought world-renowned champions such as  [[Harley Race]], [[Verne Gagne]], [[Jack Brisco]], [[Ric Flair]], [[Nick Bockwinkel]] (from whom he won the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship]] on [[April 24]], [[1983]]), and [[Rick Martel]]. Tsuruta was the first [[AJPW Triple Crown World Heavyweight Championship|AJPW Triple Crown World Heavyweight Champion]] (unifying the Pacific Wrestling Federation, All Japan United National, and All Japan International titles), defeating [[Stan Hansen]] on [[April 18]], [[1989]] in [[Tokyo]]. 

His level of work while still an active, full-time wrestler never declined and if anything, his highest rated work came in the last five years of his career, in his seminal feuds with Genichiro Tenryu and Mitsuharu Misawa. His skills allowed him to continue as a top line worker into his forties, well past his athletic prime. In the wake of his death, the press called him the strongest wrestler in the history of Japanese wrestling.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Illness, life after wrestling and death==
In the summer of 1992, he was diagnosed with [[Hepatitis B]] and never fully recovered, completing the "October Giant Series" tour before disappearing from the company for almost a year. For the rest of his career, he participated mostly in comedic matches because his health prevented him from working a full physically demanding schedule. He announced his retirement on [[February 20]], [[1999]] and held a ceremony on [[March 6]], [[1999]], after being forced out of his front-office position by [[Motoko Baba]] in the aftermath of her husband's death.

Four days later, he and his family moved to the [[United States]] so that he could take an Assistant Professor position at the [[University of Portland]] in [[Oregon]]. Tsuruta had degree in law and earned his teaching credential in 1994, later becoming a professor at his old University.

His health deteriorated, however, as he had been diagnosed with kidney cancer, which eventually spread to his liver, and by the end of the year he was back in Japan. In April he left for Australia, where he had an operation to remove the cancer, while there a kidney donor was found in Manila. Tsuruta died in the National Hospital in the [[Philippines]] on [[May 13]], [[2000]], from complications of the [[kidney transplant]]. He was 49 and was survived by his wife and three sons.
