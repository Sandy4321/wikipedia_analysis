The history of Porter and Chester Institute began in 1946 with the founding of the '''Porter School of Engineering Design''' in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].

In 1973, the Porter School of Engineering Design and the Chester Institute for Technical Education of Stratford, Connecticut, merged into one institution. Subsequently, the name Porter and Chester Institute was adopted, and the curricula contents and operational policies of the two institutions were standardized. At the same time, the Porter School, which was located in [[Rocky Hill, Connecticut]], became the Rocky Hill Campus of Porter and Chester Institute.

The Waterbury Campus was established in 1977. In 1979, the Enfield Campus was added. In 1986 the Waterbury Campus was expanded and moved to Watertown, and in 1987 the Rocky Hill Branch was also moved to larger quarters in Wethersfield.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/1090537031.html?dids=1090537031:1090537031&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug+05%2C+2006&author=ANN+MARIE+SOMMA%3B+Courant+Staff+Writer&pub=Hartford+Courant&desc=INSTITUTE+MOVING+TO+AMES+LOCATION&pqatl=google|title=Institute Moving to Ames Location|last=SOMMA|first=Ann Marie|date=August 5, 2006|work=Hartford Courant|accessdate=25 February 2010|location= Hartford, Conn. }}</ref>
