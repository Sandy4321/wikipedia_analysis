'''Sir Charles Arundell''' (died 9 December 1587), was an [[Kingdom of England|English]] gentleman, [[lord of the manor]] of [[South Petherton]], [[Somerset]], notable as an early [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[recusant]] and later as a leader of the English exiles in France. He has been suggested as the author of ''[[Leicester's Commonwealth]]'', an anonymous work which attacked [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]'s [[favourite]], the [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]]. 

==Early life and background== 
Arundell was the son of [[Thomas Arundell of Wardour Castle|Sir Thomas Arundell]] (who was [[attainder|attainted]] and executed in 1552) and of Margaret Howard (died 1571), a sister of [[Catherine Howard|Queen Catherine Howard]]. His maternal grandparents were [[Lord Edmund Howard]] (died 1539), the third son of [[Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk]], and [[Joyce Culpeper]] (c. 1480<U+2013>1531).<ref>Douglas Richardson, ''Magna Carta Ancestry'', 2nd ed., vol. I, p. 44</ref> His great aunt [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Elizabeth, Countess of Wiltshire]], was the mother of [[Anne Boleyn]], who was thus the first cousin of Arundell's mother as well as being the mother of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]],<ref name=cokayne>George Edward Cokayne & Vicary Gibbs, ''The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct or Dormant'', vol. I (London: St Catherine Press, 1910), p. 263</ref> and his ancestors on his mother's side included the [[Varangia]]n chieftain [[Rurik]] (''ca.'' 830<U+2013>879), founder of the [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikid dynasty]] which went on to rule [[Tsardom of Russia|Muscovy]] and several other states.<ref>''Descendants of Rurik, Prince of Novgorod'', [http://www.florida-crackers.net/camillia/Rurik/D23.html 23rd generation], accessed 21 November 2012</ref>

Little is known of Arundell's early life. He had an older brother, [[Matthew Arundell|Matthew]], and two sisters, Dorothy and Jane. In 1554, two years after their father's execution, the Arundell brothers were restored in blood and the elder eventually succeeded in regaining most of their father's estates in [[Dorset]] and [[Wiltshire]], including [[Wardour Castle]].<ref>'[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=c5AZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PT360#v=onepage&q&f=false Wardour Castle]', in John Preston Neale & Thomas Moule, ''Jones' views of the seats, mansions, castles, etc. of noblemen'' (Jones and Co., 1829)</ref>

==Life==
Matthew Arundell, as head of the family, regained most of Sir Thomas Arundell's lost estates, while to Charles Arundell came the manor of [[South Petherton]] in [[Somerset]].<ref name=barrell/>

Unlike his brother, Arundell was openly a recusant. With their cousin [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Lord Henry Howard]] (later created [[Earl of Northampton]]), he was briefly imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] at Christmas 1580, after both had been denounced by [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]], as traitors and spies of [[Philip II of Spain]]. Both were ostensibly friends of the Queen and slowly succeeded in clearing themselves of the charges of treason.<ref name=barrell>Charles Wisner Barrell, 'Queen Elizabeth's master showman shakes a spear in her defense', in ''The Shakespeare Fellowship Quarterly'', Spring 1947</ref> Oxford was a distant kinsman of the Arundells, and Charles Arundell's introduction of Oxford to a seminary priest, Richard Stephens, may have led to Oxford's conversion to Rome.<ref>Daphne Pearson, ''Edward De Vere (1550-1604): the crisis and consequences of wardship'' (London:Ashgate, 2005), [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ep_GHLFWQXkC&pg=PA103#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 103]</ref> 

Following his release, Arundell spent several months under house arrest. Neither he nor Howard ever returned to court favour,<ref name=barrell/> and after the [[Throckmorton Plot]] of 1583 in support of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], Arundell fled to Paris with [[Thomas Paget, 3rd Baron Paget|Thomas, Lord Paget]], the elder brother of the conspirator [[Charles Paget (conspirator)|Charles Paget]].<ref name=leimon>Simon Adams and Alan Bryson, revised by Mitchell Leimon, 'Walsingham, Sir Francis (c.1532<U+2013>1590), principal secretary', in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (2007)</ref>

In August 1584 there appeared in England ''[[Leicester's Commonwealth]]'', a brilliant and anonymous tract of Roman Catholic [[propaganda]] which attacked the Queen's [[favourite]], the [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]], and the political and religious policy of the English government, in particular the [[History of the Puritans under Elizabeth I|Puritan]] sympathies of Leicester, who was portrayed as an amoral opportunist.<ref>Alan Haynes, ''The White Bear: The Elizabethan Earl of Leicester'' (Peter Owen, ISBN 0-7206-0672-1), p. 151</ref> At that time Arundell was seen as a leader of the English Roman Catholic exiles.<ref>H. R. Woudhuysen, 'Sidney, Sir Philip (1554<U+2013>1586), author and courtier', in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2007)</ref> As early as 1947 Arundell was described as "the now generally admitted author of that Elizabethan masterpiece",<ref name=barrell/> and in his critical edition of ''Leicester's Commonwealth'' (1985), Dwight C. Peck argued that Arundell was probably the anonymous author.<ref>Dwight C. Peck, ed., ''Leicester's Commonwealth: The Copy of a Letter Written by a Master of Art of Cambridge (1584) and Related Documents'' (Athens, Ohio, & London: 1985), pp. vi<U+2013>xii</ref> Recently historians have inclined to the view that several English Catholic exiles based in France may have worked on the text, including Charles Arundell, his associate Charles Paget, and Paget's brother, Thomas, Lord Paget.<ref>Victor Houliston, ''Catholic Resistance in Elizabethan England'', Ashgate Publishing (2007), p. 13; Michael C. Questier, ''Catholicism and Community in Early Modern England'', Cambridge University Press (2006), p. 89</ref> 

Arundell was reported to have pawned his valuables to raise money for an armed landing in England to be led by the [[Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland|Earl of Westmorland]] in support of Mary, Queen of Scots. In Paris he worked with the [[James Beaton (archbishop of Glasgow)|Archbishop of Glasgow]], Mary's trusted representative in France.<ref>Duncan James Salkeld, ''Shakespeare among the Courtesans'' (2012), p. 121</ref><ref>Dennis Flynn, ''John Donne and the Ancient Catholic Nobility'' (Indiana University Press, 1995) [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nUvvE-g0jScC&pg=PA136#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 136]</ref> Arundell was a cousin of the [[Douglas Sheffield, Baroness Sheffield|wife]] of [[Edward Stafford (diplomat)|Sir Edward Stafford]] (1552<U+2013>1605), the English ambassador in Paris,<ref name=leimon/> and had a role in putting Stafford into secret contact with [[Bernardino de Mendoza]] (''c.'' 1540<U+2013>1604), the ambassador in Paris of Philip of Spain. Early in 1587, Arundell acted secretly as a mediator between them to offer Stafford's services to Philip as a spy, when Arundell received two thousand [[Crown (English coin)|crowns]] to pass on to Stafford.<ref>James McDermott, 'Stafford, Sir Edward (1552<U+2013>1605), diplomat', in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2007)</ref> 

Arundell died in Paris in 1587&mdash;in the year of the [[Singeing the King of Spain's Beard]], during the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585<U+2013>1604)|Anglo-Spanish War]] which had begun in 1585&mdash;perhaps having been poisoned.<ref>''The Shakespeare Fellowship Quarterly'', Volume 7 (Shakespeare Fellowship American Branch, 1946), p. 14</ref> It is sometimes claimed that his knighthood was bestowed on him by Philip of Spain, but he died in possession of the manor of South Petherton, which was inherited by his brother, Sir Matthew, and in the ''[[inquisition post mortem]]'' taken on 12 March 1588 he is named as "Sir Charles Arundell of London, Knt."<ref name=barrell/>
