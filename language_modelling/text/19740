Ramanujan, born and raised in [[Erode]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]], first encountered formal mathematics at age ten. He demonstrated a natural ability at math, and he was given books on advanced [[trigonometry]] by S. L. Loney.<ref>{{cite book |last=Berndt |first=Bruce C. |title= Ramanujan: Essays and Surveys|year= 2001 |publisher= [[American Mathematical Society]] |isbn= 0-8218-2624-7 | pages=p9}}</ref> He mastered the book by age thirteen, and he even discovered his own theorems. He demonstrated his true genius at school, winning accolades and awards from his school. By the age of seventeen, Ramanujan was conducting his own mathematical research on [[Bernoulli number]]s and the [[Euler<U+2013>Mascheroni constant]]. He received a scholarship to study at Government College in [[Kumbakonam]]. He failed his non-mathematical coursework, and lost his scholarship. He then joined another college to pursue independent mathematical research. In 1909, he married a nine-year old bride, Janaki Ammal, as per his parents' wishes. To make a living, he worked as a clerk in the accountant general's office at the Madras Port Trust Office.<ref name="lostnote"/> In 1912-1913, Ramanujan sent samples of his theorems to three academics at [[University of Cambridge]]. Only [[G. H. Hardy]] recognized his brilliant work, and he asked Ramanujan to study under him at Cambridge. 

Ramanujan compiled over 3500 results (mostly [[identities]] or [[equation|equations]]) during his short lifetime.<ref>{{cite book |last=Berndt |first=Bruce C. |title= Ramanujan's Notebooks Part V|year= 2005 |publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media|SpringerLink]] |isbn= 0-387-94941-0 | pages=p4}}</ref> Although a small number of these results were actually false and some were already known to other mathematicians, most of his results have now been proven to be correct.<ref name="Rediscovering Ramanujan">{{cite web |url= http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1617/16170810.htm |title=Rediscovering Ramanujan}}</ref> He stated results that were both original and highly unconventional, and these have inspired a vast amount of further research.<ref name=feaono>{{cite web |url = http://www.ams.org/notices/200606/fea-ono.pdf |author=Ken Ono|title = Honoring a Gift from
Kumbakonam}}</ref> However, some of his major discoveries have been rather slow to enter the mathematical mainstream. Recently, Ramanujan's formulae have found applications in the field of [[crystallography]] and in [[string theory]]. The ''Ramanujan Journal'', an international publication, was launched to publish work in all the areas of mathematics that were influenced by Ramanujan.

==Life==
===Childhood and early life===
Ramanujan was born in [[1887]] in [[Erode]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]], at the place of residence of his maternal grandparents. His father, K.Srinivasa Iyengar worked as an accountant and hailed from the fertile district of [[Thanjavur]]. His mother, Komalatammal was a housewife. They lived in Saarangapani Street in a south-Indian-style home (now a museum) in the town of Kumbakonam. In 1898, at the age of 10, Ramanujan entered the town high school, THSS, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.<ref>{{citeweb |url = http://www.geocities.com/townhss |title =   Town Higher Secondary School}}</ref> By the age of 11, he had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of two college students, who were lodgers at his home. He was later lent books on advanced trigonometry written by S.L. Loney.<ref> {{citeweb | url = http://www.amazon.com/trigonometry-Loney-Michigan-Historical-Reprint/dp/1418185094 |title=Trignometry book }}</ref> and he completely mastered this book by the age of 13 and was discovering sophisticated theorems of his own. His biographer reports that by 14 his true genius was evident. He achieved merit certificates and academic awards throughout his school career and was also assisting the school in the [[logistics]] of assigning its 1200 students (each with their own needs) to its 35-odd teachers, completing mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and showing familiarity with [[infinite series]]. When he was sixteen and in the sixth form, he came across the book, ''A synopsis of elementary results in pure and applied mathematics'' written by George S. Carr.<ref>{{citeweb | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=FTgAAAAAQAAJ&dq=a+synopsis+of+elementary+results+in+pure+and+applied+mathematics&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=iR6nr3NpCm&sig=nQsrxKSgkf0k3HAgPbpnxGhfz2M |title = George Carr}}</ref> This book, a collection of 6000 theorems, served to introduce Ramanujan to the real world of mathematics, but in a highly personal style that relegated the proofs, if any, to mere footnotes.<ref>{{citeweb |url = http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Lab/3550/ramanuj.htm |author=Dinoj Surendran|title = The most touching story in mathematics}}</ref> By the age of 17, he had independently developed and investigated the [[Bernoulli numbers]] and had calculated [[Euler-Mascheroni constant|Euler's constant]] up to 15 decimal places. His peers of the time commented later, "We, including teachers, rarely understood him" and "stood in respectful awe" of him.<ref name="The man who knew infinity">{{citeweb |url = http://www.amazon.com/dp/0349104522/ |ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181609394&sr=1-1 |title=The man who knew infinity}}</ref>
 
Ramanujan received a scholarship to study at Government College in [[Kumbakonam]] but was so intent on studying mathematics that he could not focus on any other subjects and failed most of them, losing his scholarship in the process. He failed again in the next college he joined but continued to pursue independent research in mathematics. At this point in his life, he lived in extreme poverty and was often near the point of [[starvation]].

===Adulthood in India===
In 1909, Ramanujan was married to a nine-year old bride, Janaki Ammal, as per the customs of India at that time and began searching for a job. With his collection of mathematical results, he travelled door to door around the city of [[Madras]] (now Chennai) looking for a clerical position. Eventually, he found a position in the accountant general's office and subsequently in the accounts section of the Madras Port Trust. Ramanujan wanted to focus his time completely on mathematics and needed financial help to carry on his research. He solicited support from many influential Indians and published several papers in Indian mathematical journals, but was unsuccessful in his attempts to foster sponsorship. It might be the case that he was supported by Ramachandra Rao, then the collector of the [[Nellore]] district and a distinguished civil servant. Rao, an amateur mathematician himself, was the uncle of the well-known mathematician, [[K. Ananda Rao]], who went on to become the Principal of the Presidency College.

Following his supervisor's advice, Ramanujan, in late [[1912]] and early [[1913]], sent letters and samples of his theorems to three Cambridge academics: [[H. F. Baker]], [[E. W. Hobson]], and [[G. H. Hardy]]. The first two professors returned his letters without any comments. On the other hand, Hardy had the foresight to quickly recognize Ramanujan as a genius. Upon reading the initial unsolicited missive by an unknown and untrained Indian mathematician, G.H. Hardy and his colleague [[J.E. Littlewood]] after discussion, concluded, "not one [theorem] could have been set in the most advanced mathematical examination in the world."<ref name ="The man who knew infinity">{{citeweb |url = http://www.amazon.com/dp/0349104522/ |ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1181609394&sr=1-1 |title=The man who knew infinity}}</ref> Although Hardy was one of the most eminent mathematicians of his day and an expert in a number of fields that Ramanujan was writing about, he commented that, "many of them [theorems] defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before"<ref name="The man who knew infinity"/>.

===Life in England===
After some initial scepticism, Hardy replied with comments, requesting proofs for some of the discoveries, and began to make plans to bring Ramanujan to Cambridge. Ramanujan was at first apprehensive to travel overseas due to religious reasons, but eventually his well-wishers prevailed upon him and he agreed to come to England. He spent nearly five years in Cambridge collaborating with Hardy and Littlewood and published a part of his findings there. Hardy and Ramanujan had highly contrasting personalities. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures, beliefs and working styles. Hardy was an atheist and an apostle of proof and mathematical rigour, whereas, Ramanujan was a deeply religious man and relied very strongly on his intuition. While in England, Hardy tried his best to fill the gaps in Ramanujan's education without interrupting his spell of inspiration. 

Ramanujan was awarded a B.A. degree in March 1916 for his work on [[Highly composite numbers]] which was published as a paper in the Journal of the London Mathematical Society. He was the second Indian to become a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1918 and he became one of the youngest Fellows in the entire history of the Royal Society. He was elected "for his investigation in Elliptic Functions and the Theory of Numbers." On [[1918-10-13]] he became the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.<ref>{{citeweb |url= http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/Ramanujan.HTM |title = Srinivasa Ramanujan: A Remarkable Mathematical Genius}}</ref>

===Illness and return to India===
Plagued by health problems all through his life, living in a country far away from home, and obsessively involved with his mathematics, Ramanujan's health worsened in England, perhaps exacerbated by [[stress (medicine)|stress]], and by the scarcity of [[vegetarian food]] during the [[World War I|First World War]]. He was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and a severe [[vitamin]] deficiency and was confined to a sanatorium. Ramanujan returned to Kumbakonam, India in 1919 and died soon thereafter at the age of 32. His wife, S. Janaki Ammal, lived in Chennai (formerly Madras) until her death in 1994.<ref>{{citeweb |url = http://www.imsc.res.in/~rao/ramanujan/newnow/janaki.pdf |title =Ramanujan<U+2019>s wife: Janakiammal (Janaki)}}</ref>

A [[1994]] analysis of Ramanujan's medical records and symptoms by Dr. D.A.B. Young concluded that it was much more likely he had hepatic [[amoeba|amoebiasis]], a parasitic infection of the liver.  This is supported by the fact that Ramanujan had spent time in Madras, where the disease was widespread.  He had had two cases of [[dysentery]] before he left India. When not properly treated, dysentery can lie dormant for years and lead to hepatic amoebiasis.<ref name="lostnote"/> It was a difficult disease to diagnose, but once diagnosed would have been readily curable.<ref name="lostnote"/>

===Personality===
Ramanujan has been described as a person with a somewhat shy and quiet disposition, a dignified man with pleasant manners.<ref name="Ramanujan's Personality">{{cite web |url= http://www.imsc.res.in/~rao/ramanujan/newnow/pcm5.htm
|title=Ramanujan's Personality}}</ref> He was also known to be extremely sensitive. On one occasion, he had prepared a buffet for a number of guests, and when one guest politely refused to taste a dish he had prepared, he left immediately and took a taxi to Oxford. He also lived a rather spartan life while at Cambridge. He frequently cooked vegetables alone in his room.<ref name="The man who knew infinity"/>

===Spiritual life===
Ramanujan believed in Hindu gods all his life and lived as an observant [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[Brahmin]]. "Iyengar" refers to a class of brahmins in southern India who worship the god [[Vishnu]], the preserver of the universe. His first Indian biographers describe him as rigorously orthodox. Ramanujan credited his acumen to his family [[goddess]], [[Namagiri]], and looked to her for inspiration in his work. He often said, "An equation for me has no meaning, unless it represents a thought of God."<ref>{{citeweb | url = http://lagrange.math.trinity.edu/aholder/misc/quotes.shtml | title = Quote by Srinivasa Ramanujan Iyengar}}</ref>

==Mathematical achievements==
In mathematics, there is a distinction between having an insight and having a proof. Ramanujan's talent suggested a plethora of formulae that could then be investigated in depth later. It is said that Ramanujan's discoveries are unusually rich and that there is often more in it than what initially meets the eye. As a by-product, new directions of research were opened up. Examples of the most interesting of these formulas include the intriguing infinite [[Series (mathematics)|series]] for [[pi|<U+03C0>]], one of which is given below

:<math> \frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{9801} \sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{(k!)^4 396^{4k}} </math>

This result is based on the negative [[fundamental discriminant]] d = <U+2013>4<U+00D7>58 with class number ''h''(''d'') = 2 (note that 57<U+00D7>13<U+00D7>58 = 26390) and is related to the fact that,

:<math> e^{\pi \sqrt{58}} = 396^4 - 104.000000177\dots. </math>

Ramanujan's series for <U+03C0> converges extraordinarily rapidly (exponentially) and forms the basis of some of the fastest algorithms currently used to calculate <U+03C0>. 

His intuition also led him to derive some previously unknown [[identity (mathematics)|identities]], such as

:<math> \left [ 1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos(n\theta)}{\cosh(n\pi)} \right ]^{-2} + \left [1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cosh(n\theta)}{\cosh(n\pi)} \right ]^{-2} = \frac {2 \Gamma^4 \left ( \frac{3}{4} \right )}{\pi} </math>

for all <math>\theta</math>, where <math>\Gamma(z)</math> is the [[gamma function]].  Equating coefficients of <math>\theta^0</math>, <math>\theta^4</math>, and <math>\theta^8</math> gives some deep identities for the [[hyperbolic secant]].

In 1918, G. H. Hardy and Ramanujan studied the partition function ''P''(''n'') extensively and gave a very accurate non-convergent asymptotic series that permitted exact computation of the number of partitions of an integer. Hans Rademacher, in 1937, was able to refine their formula to find an exact convergent series solution to this problem. This astonishing non-intuitive formula was a spectacular achievement in analytical number theory. Ramanujan and Hardy's work in this area gave rise to a powerful new method called the circle method which has found tremendous applications.<ref name="Partition Function">{{cite web |url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartitionFunctionP.html |title=Partition Formula}}</ref>

===The Ramanujan conjecture===
:''Main article: [[Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture]]

Although there are numerous statements that could bear the name ''Ramanujan conjecture'', there is one statement that was very influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this conjecture with conjectures of A.Weil in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That [[Ramanujan conjecture]] is an assertion on the size of the [[tau function]], which has as generating function the discriminant modular form <U+0394>(''q''), a typical [[cusp form]] in the theory of [[modular forms]]. It was finally proved in [[1973]], as a consequence of [[Pierre Deligne]]'s proof of the [[Weil conjectures]]. The reduction step involved is complicated. Deligne won a Fields Medal for his work on Weil conjectures.<ref name=feaono/>

===Ramanujan's notebooks===
While he was still in India, Ramanujan recorded the bulk of his results in four notebooks of [[loose leaf]] paper. These results were mostly written up without any derivations. This is probably the origin of the misperception that Ramanujan was unable to prove his results and simply thought up the final result directly. Mathematician [[Bruce Berndt]], in his review of these notebooks and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan most certainly was able to make the proofs of most of his results, but chose not to.

This style of working may have been for several reasons. Since paper was very expensive, Ramanujan would do most of his work and perhaps his proofs on [[slate (writing)|slate]], and then transfer just the results to paper. Using a slate was common for mathematics students in India at the time.  He was also quite likely to have been influenced by the style of G. S. Carr's book, which stated results without proofs. Finally, it is possible that Ramanujan considered his workings to be for his personal interest alone; and therefore only recorded the results.<ref name = "Bruce Berndt on Ramanujan">{{cite web |url = http://www.amazon.com/Ramanujans-Notebooks-Part-Bruce-Berndt/dp/0387949410 |title = Ramanujans Notebooks}}</ref>

The first notebook has 351 pages with 16 somewhat organized chapters and some unorganized material. The second notebook has 256 pages in 21 chapters and 100 unorganized pages, with the third notebook containing 33 unorganized pages. The results in his notebooks inspired numerous papers by later mathematicians trying to prove what he had found.  Hardy himself created papers exploring material from Ramanujan's work as did [[G. N. Watson]], B. M. Wilson, and [[Bruce Berndt]].<ref name = "Bruce Berndt on Ramanujan">{{cite web |url = http://www.amazon.com/Ramanujans-Notebooks-Part-Bruce-Berndt/dp/0387949410 |title = Ramanujans Notebooks}}</ref> A fourth notebook, the so-called [[Ramanujan's lost notebook|"lost notebook"]], was rediscovered in 1976 by George Andrews.<ref name="lostnote"/>

==Other mathematicians' views of Ramanujan ==
Ramanujan is generally hailed as an all time great mathematician like Euler, Gauss or Jacobi for his natural genius{{citeweb | url=http://www.imsc.res.in/~rao/ramanujan.html |title=<sup>5<sup>}} [[G. H. Hardy]] quotes: "The limitations of his knowledge were as startling as its profundity. Here was a man who could work out [[modular equation]]s and theorems... to orders unheard of, whose mastery of [[continued fraction]]s was... beyond that of any mathematician in the world, who had found for himself the functional equation of the [[zeta function]] and the dominant terms of many of the most famous problems in the analytic theory of numbers; and yet he had never heard of a [[doubly-periodic function]] or of [[Cauchy's integral theorem|Cauchy's theorem]], and had indeed but the vaguest idea of what a function of a [[complex variable]] was..."<ref>{{citeweb |url = http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Ramanujan.html | title = Ramanujan quote}}</ref> Hardy went on to claim that his greatest contribution to mathematics came from Ramanujan.

Quoting K. Srinivasa Rao,<ref name=imscraman>{{citeweb | url=http://www.imsc.res.in/~rao/ramanujan.html|author=K Srinivasa Rao |title=Srinivasa Ramanujan (December 22, 1887 - April 26, 1920)}}</ref> "As for his place in the world of Mathematics, we quote Bruce C Berndt: "Paul Erd<U+0151>s has passed on to us G. H. Hardy's personal ratings of mathematicians. Suppose that we rate mathematicians on the basis of pure talent on a scale from 0 to 100, Hardy gave himself a score of 25, J.E. Littlewood 30, [[Hilbert]] 80 and Ramanujan 100.'"

In his book ''Scientific Edge'', noted physicist [[Jayant Narlikar]] says that "Srinivasa Ramanujan, discovered by the Cambridge mathematician G.H. Hardy, whose great mathematical findings were beginning to be appreciated from 1915 to 1919. His achievements were to be fully understood much later, well after his untimely death in 1920. For example, his work on the highly composite numbers (numbers with a large number of factors) started a whole new line of investigations in the theory of such numbers.<U+201D> Narlikar also goes on to say that his work was one of the top ten achievements of [[20th century|20<sup>th</sup> century]] Indian science and "could be considered in the [[Nobel Prize]] class."<ref>{{citeweb |url = http://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Edge-Indian-Scientist-Modern/dp/0143030280 | title = Narlikar's book}}</ref> The work of other 20<sup>th</sup> century Indian scientists which Narlikar considered to be of Nobel Prize class were those of [[Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman]], [[Meghnad Saha]] and [[Satyendra Nath Bose]].

==Recognition==
Ramanujan's home state of Tamil Nadu celebrates [[December 22]] (Ramanujan's birthday) as 'State IT Day', memorializing both the man and his achievements, as a native of Tamil Nadu.

A stamp picturing Ramanujan was released by the [[Government of India]] in 1962 <U+2014> the 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Ramanujan's birth <U+2014> commemorating his achievements in the field of number theory. 

A prize for young mathematicians from developing countries has been created in the name of Srinivasa Ramanujan by the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] (ICTP), in cooperation with the [[International Mathematical Union|IMU]], who nominate members of the prize committee.

During the year [[1987]] (Ramanujan's [[centennial]]), the printed form of ''Ramanujan's Lost Notebook'' by Springer-Narosa was released by the late Indian prime minister, [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who presented the first copy to S. Janaki Ammal Ramanujan (Ramanujan's late widow) and the second copy to [[George Andrews]] in recognition of his contributions in the field of number theory.
