'''David Keith Stewart''' (born February 19, 1957) is an American [[professional baseball]] [[pitcher]], [[Coach (baseball)#Pitching coach|pitching coach]], [[sports agent]] and front office executive. He is currently the [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] of the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. He played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) from 1978 through 1995 for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], [[Philadelphia Phillies]], [[Oakland Athletics]], and [[Toronto Blue Jays]].

Stewart was a [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star]] and a 20-game winner for four consecutive years. He was known for his [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason]] performance <U+2013> winning one [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award]] and two [[League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award]]s <U+2013> and for staring down batters when pitching to them.  He served as a pitching coach for the [[San Diego Padres]], [[Milwaukee Brewers]], and  Blue Jays after his retirement from pitching. He later served as a sports agent, based in [[San Diego]], until he was hired by the Diamondbacks at the end of the 2014 season.

==Early life==
Stewart was born in [[Oakland, California]]. His father, David, was a [[longshoreman]] and his mother, Nathalie, worked at a [[cannery]].<ref name="SI"/> His father didn't want Stewart to play sports, because he felt you couldn't make a living hitting a ball, so his older brother taught him how to play.<ref name="SI"/> He attended [[St. Elizabeth High School (Oakland, California)|St. Elizabeth High School]] in Oakland, where he he earned All-American honors in both baseball (where he played [[catcher]]) and in football (where he was a [[linebacker]] and [[tight end]]). He also averaged 16 points a game as a [[small forward]] on the basketball team.<ref name=different>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&dat=19881013&id=83whAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vogFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4717,3625991|title=Schenectady Gazette - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}</ref><ref name=Boys>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pfgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=Dave+Stewart+dodgers+catcher+1975+draft&source=bl&ots=Qb5q1GmDjV&sig=TRRfyRr4hCemT8VChUdvnb2v2-k&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rawlVOK3Js-roQTahICIBw&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=Dave%20Stewart%20dodgers%20catcher%201975%20draft&f=false|title=Dave Stewart:Most Valuable Pitcher|work=Boy's Life Magazine|first=Robert E.|last=Hood|date=August 1991|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}</ref> He was offered 30 college scholarships to play football, but turned them all down to sign with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], who selected him in the 16th round of the [[1975 Major League Baseball Draft]].<ref name=Boys/>

==Professional career==
===Early career===
The Dodgers decided to turn him into a [[pitcher]] because of his strong arm.<ref name=different/> He made his major league debut on September 22, 1978 as a pitcher. He did not find his niche in the major leagues until some time later. After returning to the minor leagues, he resurfaced in the Majors again in 1981. Teams were unsure how he would be best utilized, and Stewart split time starting and [[relief pitcher|relieving]] for the Dodgers. On August 19, 1983, the Dodgers traded Stewart with a [[player to be named later]] ([[Ricky Wright]]) to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] for [[Rick Honeycutt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&dat=19830820&id=3ldWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6-4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4504,2266526|title=The Spokesman-Review - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&dat=19830821&id=31dWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6-4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2607,2600799|title=The Spokesman-Review - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}</ref>

Stewart continued as a relief pitcher with the Rangers. On September 13, 1985, the Rangers traded Stewart to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] for [[Rich Surhoff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&dat=19850914&id=fJEqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wVgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5529,3439169|title=The Victoria Advocate - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}</ref> In the offseason, Stewart negotiated with the [[Yomiuri Giants]] of [[Nippon Professional Baseball]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19860123&id=BgMiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=maYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3190,1750294|title=Reading Eagle - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}</ref> but they did not agree to terms on a contract. Stewart resigned with the Phillies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19860201&id=SqNPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PgYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7016,104131|title=Ocala Star-Banner - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}</ref>

In May 1986, the Phillies released Stewart after he appeared in 12 games for the team, recording a 6.00 [[earned run average]] (ERA). He signed with the [[Oakland Athletics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-01-12/sports/1991012074_1_baltimore-orioles-orioles-finished-rader|title=A's Stewart once spurned by Orioles Baltimore had shot to sign him in '86|work=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}</ref> Stewart successfully converted to a starting role with the A's, posting a 9<U+2013>5 record. During the season, he punched [[Pat Corrales]], the [[manager (baseball)|manager]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]], during a game, which initiated a bench-clearing brawl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-07-02/sports/sp-476_1_dave-stewart|title=Stewart Lands Punch to Manager Corrales, but Indians Knock Out A's, 9-0|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}</ref>

Also in 1986, Stewart developed a [[forkball]] to supplement his [[fastball]] and [[slider]].<ref name="JamesNeyer2004">{{cite book|last1=James|first1=Bill|last2=Neyer|first2=Rob|title=The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers: An Historical Compendium of Pitching, Pitchers, and Pitches|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7FfRLE6I5EEC&pg=GBS.PA394.w.1.3.0|accessdate=May 25, 2012|date=June 15, 2004|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743261586|pages=394<U+2013>395}}</ref>

===1987<U+2013>90===
In 1987 he won 20 games while posting a 3.68 ERA and [[strikeout|striking out]] 205 batters. His new-found stardom would not be short-lived as he won 20 or more games in each of the next three seasons (1988<U+2013>1990). Remarkably, he pitched over 250 innings in each of those four seasons, frequently posting complete games and led a powerful Athletics club to the [[World Series]] each of those years. In 1988 he went 21<U+2013>12, 3.23 ERA while leading the AL with 14 complete games and 275 2/3 innings pitched. In 1989 he went 21<U+2013>9 with a 3.32 ERA, and in 1990 he went 22<U+2013>11, finishing 3rd in the AL with a 2.56 ERA and led the league in innings pitched (267), complete games (11) and shutouts (4)

In [[1989 World Series|1989]], the Athletics won the World Series championship, with Stewart, who won two of the four games while giving up just three runs (2<U+2013>0 1.69 ERA including a complete game shutout in the opener), being named [[World Series MVP Award|World Series MVP]]. In 1990, the A's won their third straight pennant, beating the [[Boston Red Sox]] in the [[1990 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]], and Stewart was named the ALCS MVP going 2<U+2013>0 with a 1.13 ERA. However, Oakland was upset in the World Series with a sweep by a decidedly underdog [[Cincinnati Reds]] squad. Despite going 0<U+2013>2 in the series Stewart still posted a very respectable 2.77 ERA.

On June 29, 1990, Stewart [[no-hitter|no-hit]] his future team, the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], at [[Rogers Centre|SkyDome]], the first no-hitter by an African American since [[Jim Bibby]] in 1973 and, the last thrown by an Athletic before [[Dallas Braden]] pitched a [[perfect game]] on May 9, 2010. In a game that started minutes after Stewart's no-hitter finished, Dodger [[Fernando Valenzuela]] (a pitching mate of Stewart's on the Dodgers' [[1981 World Series]] champions) no-hit the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] at [[Dodger Stadium]] <U+2013> the first time in Major League history that no-hitters had been thrown in both leagues on the same day. Coincidentally, [[ESPN]] broadcast both games back-to-back that night.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/gallery/featured/GAL1137746/21/26/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Most Popular}}</ref>

===1991<U+2013>95===
Stewart was also a part of the [[1992 Oakland Athletics season|1992 Oakland]] team which lost in the [[1992 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] to the Blue Jays.  Toronto went on to win the [[1992 World Series|World Series]] that year, catching Stewart's eye and prompting him to sign with them in [[1993 Toronto Blue Jays season|1993]].  The Blue Jays made it to the [[1993 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] once again, and triumphed over the [[1993 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] 4 games to 2, with Stewart winning ALCS MVP honors for the second time in his career.  The Blue Jays then went on to defeat the [[1993 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] 4 games to 2 in the [[1993 World Series|World Series]].  Stewart remained with the Blue Jays for the 1994 season, then returned to Oakland to finish his career in 1995.

Over his career, he started 18 games in the postseason, compiling a stellar 2.84 ERA and 10<U+2013>6 record.  In the LCS, he was especially dominant, going 8<U+2013>0.  Including the postseason, Stewart posted a 9<U+2013>1 career record against [[Roger Clemens]].

==Post-playing career==
Stewart served as the assistant to [[Sandy Alderson]], the [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] of the Athletics, in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/11588600/dave-stewart-hired-arizona-diamondbacks-general-manager|title=Dave Stewart hired to be Arizona Diamondbacks general manager - ESPN|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}</ref> In 1997, [[Kevin Towers]], the [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] of the [[San Diego Padres]], hired Stewart as his assistant.
