'''Massachusetts National Cemetery''' is a [[U.S. National Cemetery]] located in [[Bourne, Massachusetts]], in [[Barnstable County]] on [[Cape Cod]], approximately 65&nbsp;miles (105&nbsp;km)  southeast of [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and adjacent to the [[Otis Air National Guard Base]]. As of fiscal year 2008, 46,380 have been interred there.

== History ==

On June 18, 1973, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the National Cemetery Act which transferred 82 of the [[United States Army|United States Army<U+2019>s]] national cemeteries to the [[Veteran's Administration]] (VA). The following year, the VA<U+2019>s National Cemetery System adopted the regional cemetery concept plan in which one large national cemetery would be built within each of the 10 standard federal regions, as established by the [[General Services Administration]]. A policy was established that new cemeteries would only be created on land already owned by the federal government.

No new national cemetery had been built in the [[New England]] region in nearly forty years, since 1936, when the [[Long Island National Cemetery]] opened.

During the mid-1970s, when the National Cemetery System was looking to expand, it determined that the largest veteran population in the northeast was centered in the Boston area. A search soon commenced to find a suitable site for a national cemetery, nearby. The difficult task of locating land which would be available to the government at no cost eventually led to the identification of a 749-acre (3.0&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) tract on the 22,000-acre (89&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) Otis Air Force Base as the most likely site. The base occupied land that was leased to the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DOD). A portion of this lease was terminated and the title for {{convert|749.29|acre}} was transferred to the VA<U+2019>s National Cemetery System in 1976. The Otis tract became the first parcel of land acquired by the National Cemetery System for the specific purpose of building a new national cemetery since 1949.

The Massachusetts National Cemetery was dedicated on October 11, 1980 and became the third new national cemetery to open in nearly 30&nbsp;years. [[Calverton National Cemetery|Calverton N.C.]] in [[New York]], and [[Riverside National Cemetery|Riverside N.C.]] in [[California]], were the first and second, respectively. The site was officially named the '''Veterans Administration National Cemetery of Bourne, Mass.''', but over time the lengthy appellation changed in practice, if not in fact, to simply, "Massachusetts National Cemetery".

== Monuments and memorials ==

Massachusetts National Cemetery has a memorial trail where, {{As of|2005|alt=as of February 2005}}, 47&nbsp;memorials and a [[carillon]] have been erected in memory of veterans from [[World War I]] to the modern era.
