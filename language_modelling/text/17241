The '''Manchester Evening News Arena''' or '''M.E.N. Arena''' (commonly referred to as just '''The M.E.N.''' or simply '''Manchester Arena''') is a large indoor arena in [[Manchester]], England. It is currently sponsored by the [[Manchester Evening News]] and has a capacity of 3,000 to a maximum capacity of 23,000 depending on the event being staged, making it one of the largest indoor arenas in Europe. It was opened in 1995, and was initially sponsored by NYNEX (a British cable television provider, as opposed to the NYNEX Corporation, a telephone service provider in the United States) as the '''NYNEX Arena'''. The Arena took its current name in 1998 after the NYNEX brand name had disappeared as a result of a merger with [[Mercury Communications]] in 1997.

The M.E.N. Arena is one of the world's busiest indoor arenas and concert venue.<ref name="smgeurope">{{cite web |url=http://www.smg-europe.com/venue-profile.php?iVenuesId=8 |author= |title=Manchester Evening News arena |publisher=smg-europe.com}} Retrieved on 28&nbsp;March 2008.</ref> The arena was built to coincide with Manchester's two bids to host the Olympic games in 1996 and 2000 (which were won by [[Atlanta]] in 1996 and Sydney in 2000).

The M.E.N. Arena was one of the first indoor venues in Europe to be built following the traditionally American sports arena layout of 360 degree seating, and is the only arena in the UK to have this feature (London's O2 Arena also has 360 degrees seating, but only in one tier, whereas the M.E.N. arena features it on both tiers). Other European indoor venues built to the same concept include the [[K<U+00F6>lnarena]] in [[Cologne]], [[Zagreb Arena]] in [[Zagreb]], [[Spaladium Arena]] in [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Belgrade Arena]] in [[Belgrade]], [[O2 Arena (Prague)|O<sub>2</sub> arena]] in [[Prague]], [[Color Line Arena]] in [[Hamburg, Germany|Hamburg]], and similarly [[The O2 arena (London)|The O<sub>2</sub> arena]] in London.

The M.E.N.'s seating capacity is one of Europe's most dynamic for an indoor venue. It is often chosen by touring acts because its design and layout makes the venue ideal for any type of performance. One day the arena could host an ice rink, the next day a concert, the next day a basketball match. The seating is split into an upper tier (bowl) and a lower tier, separated by 35 hospitality suites.

==History==
The Manchester Evening News arena was constructed as part of Manchester's unsuccessful bid for the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] Games.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parkinson-Bailey|first=John J.|title=Manchester: An Architectural History |publisher=Manchester University Press (|date=25 May 2000|edition=Hardcover|pages=250|isbn=0719056063|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ush5WC9BM_gC&lpg=PP1&pg=RA1-PA250#v=onepage&q=&f=false|accessdate=2 October 2009}}</ref> It cost <U+00A3>52&nbsp;million to build with <U+00A3>35.5M from government grants and <U+00A3>2.5M from the European Economic Development Fund. The structure was designed by DLA Ellerbe Beckett, Ove Group, and Austin-Smith:Lord. The arena was opened on 15&nbsp;July 1995. On the opening night, 15,000 spectators watched [[Jayne Torvill]] and [[Christopher Dean]] perform; the crowd was a record for an ice event.<ref name="Inglis101">Inglis (2004), p.&nbsp;101.</ref> Attendance records were set in 1997 when 17,425 people watched Manchester Storm play [[Sheffield Steelers]], a record for an ice hockey match in Europe. When 14,151 people watched [[Manchester Giants]] play [[London Leopards]] it set a new British record for attendance at a basketball match.<ref name="Inglis101"/>

==Arena success==
The M.E.N. Arena has attracted a huge number of customers since opening its doors in 1995, as it is Europe's largest concert venue. The opening event held there was a performance by [[Torvill and Dean]], as part of their farewell tour. The venue attracts over a million customers each year for concerts and family shows alone, making the venue one of the world's busiest indoor arenas, in regard to this the M.E.N. Arena was named "International Venue Of The Year" in 2002 by concert industry insiders in the 'Pollstar' awards, and was nominated in the same category in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. The M.E.N. Arena was also named "Busiest Arena Venue In The World", based on ticket sales for concerts in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 beating competition from other indoor arena's including New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] and London's [[Wembley Arena]]. (2007 figures) The Arena has also been named the 'World's Busiest Arena' of the last five years (2001<U+2013>2007) based solely on ticket sales for concerts, attracting five and a half million customers to concerts. The MEN Arena was voted Europe's Favorite Arena' at the TIP Awards for 2008 voted for by the numerous touring companies that bring the shows to the venue. 

In 2007, the Arena was named 'World's Busiest Arena' for concerts for a record fifth time, the top ten venues in 2007 were:<ref>{{cite web |title=From unwanted empty shell to the world<U+2019>s busiest venue |work=[[Manchester Evening News]] |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article3134279.ece |author=Will Pavia |date=5&nbsp;January 2008}} Retrieved on 31&nbsp;August 2008.</ref>

== Visitor transport information ==
The venue adjoins [[Manchester Victoria station|Victoria train station]]. This therefore provides good access to the arena from train lines calling here. A Metrolink tram stop is also located in the train station. This provides services to Bury in one direction and the city centre, onwards to Altrincham and Eccles, in the other. NB Those travelling from Eccles will have to change either at Cornbrook or St Peter's Square. 

Visitors traveling by train to Manchester Piccadilly can either walk to the arena or catch a Metrolink tram from Piccadilly to Victoria. A number of bus routes always run to the area of the arena. 

The arena has its own large car park nearby but by its nature endures delays upon departure after the event, as everyone tries to exit at the same time. Other smaller car parks are located around the city centre. On street parking can be found in the area and on the various streets around the main Deangate street area.
