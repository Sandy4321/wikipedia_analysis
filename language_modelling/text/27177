The '''Ebionites''' (from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; '''<U+05D0><U+05D1><U+05D9><U+05D5><U+05E0><U+05D9><U+05DD>''', '''Ebyonim''', "the Poor Ones") were an early [[sect]] of mostly [[Jew]]ish [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] of [[Jesus]], who flourished in and around the [[land of Israel]], as one of several [[Jewish Christian]] communities coexisting from the 1st to the 5th century of the [[Common Era]].<ref name="Tabor 1998"/> Where they took their name from is unclear, since the word appears in several religious texts, such as the [[Dead Sea scrolls]],<ref name="Eisenman & Wise 1992">{{cite book| author = Eisenman, Robert; Wise, Michael| title = The Dead Sea Scrolls Uncovered| publisher = Spring | year = 1992 | id = ISBN 1852303689}}</ref> the ''[[Epistle of James]]'',<ref name="Eisenman 1997">{{cite book| author = Eisenman, Robert| title = James the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls | publisher = Viking | year = 1997 | id = ISBN 1842930265}}</ref> and the ''[[Gospel of Luke]]'' which features one of Jesus' most well-known [[beatitudes|blessings]]: "Congratulations, you [[Poverty#Religious poverty|poor]]!

Since there is no authenticated [[Ebionites#Archaeology|archaeological evidence]] for the existence of the Ebionites, their nature and history cannot be definitely reconstructed from surviving references. The little that is known about them comes from [[Talk:Ebionites/Sources|biased references]] by early and influential [[theology|theologian]]s and writers in the [[Christian Church]], who considered them to be "[[heretics]]" and "[[Judaizers]]".<ref name="Klijn & Reinink 1973">{{cite book| author = Klijn A.F.J.; Reinink, G.J.| title = Patristic Evidence for Jewish-Christian Sects| publisher = Brill | year = 1973 | id = ISBN 9004037632 }}</ref> However, according to the select few modern [[Quest for the Historical Jesus#The Third Quest|scholars who have studied the historicity of the Ebionites]], they existed as a community distinct from [[early Christianity]] before and after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem in 70 C.E.]], but were marginalized and persecuted by [[gentile]] Christians despite the possibility that they may have been more faithful than [[Paul of Tarsus]] to the authentic [[Ministry of Jesus#Teachings|teachings]] of the [[historical Jesus]].<ref name="Schoeps 1969">{{cite book| author = Schoeps, Hans-Joachim| title = Jewish Christianity: Factional Disputes in the Early Church.

==History==
{{Jewish Christianity}}
In 140 C.E., [[Justin Martyr]], in the earliest [[Talk:Ebionites/Sources|text]] known to us, describes an unnamed sect estranged from the Church who observe the [[Law of Moses]], and who hold it of universal obligation.<ref>Ante-Nicene Fathers, Justin Martyr</ref> In 180 C.E, [[Irenaeus]] was the first to use the term "Ebionites" to describe a heretical judaizing sect, which he regarded as [[Legalism (theology)|stubbornly clinging to the Law]].<ref>Ante-Nicene Fathers, Irenaeus </ref> In 212 C.E., [[Origen]] remarks that the name derives from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word "evyon", meaning "poor".<ref>Ante-Nicene Fathers, Origen, De Principiis</ref> The most complete yet questionable [[Talk:Ebionites/Sources|account]] comes from [[Epiphanius of Salamis]], who wrote a [[heresiology]] in the 4th century, denouncing 80 heretical sects, among them the Ebionites.<ref name="Koch 1976">{{cite book| author = Koch, Glenn Alan| title = A Critical Investigation of Epiphanius' Knowdedge of the Ebionites: A Translation and Critical Discussion of 'Panarion' 30| publisher = University of Pennsylvania| year = 1976}}</ref> These are mostly general descriptions of their religious ideology, though sometimes there are quotations from their [[Ebionites#Writings|gospel]]s, which are otherwise lost to us.

Often depending upon another for their assessment, the [[Fathers of the Church]] distinguished the Ebionites from  the [[Carpocrates|Carpocratians]], the [[Cerinthus|Cerinthians]], the [[Elkasaites]], the [[Nasoraean]]s, the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]s, the [[Nazoraean]]s, and the [[Sampsaeans]], which were all early sects of Jewish disciples of Jesus who held traditional or [[Fathers of Christian Gnosticism|gnostic]] [[Christian views of Jesus|Christian views]] rejected by the Ebionites. [[Eusebius]], however, mentions that a minority of Ebionites came to embrace some of these views despite keeping their name.<ref>Ante-Nicene Fathers, Eusebius</ref> 

Although it is an open question whether the Ebionites, denounced by the Church Fathers, were direct descendants of the earliest "[[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|Christian church of Jerusalem]]" (which thrived from ''c.'' 30 to 135 C.E.) or the first "[[Cenacle|Judeo-Christian synagogue]]" (built on Mount [[Zion]] between 70 and 132 C.E.),<ref name="Klijn & Reinink 1973"/><ref name="Pixner 1990">{{cite paper|    author = Pixner, Bargil|    title = Church of the Apostles found on Mt. Zion|    date = 1990|   url = http://www.centuryone.org/apostles.html| accessdate = 2007-03-11}}</ref> some scholars argue that the first self-identified Ebionites were poor Jewish [[peasant]]s who began to follow [[John the Baptizer]] ''c''. 23 C.E.. After the death of John, many of them joined the "[[kingdom of God]]" movement started by Jesus, whom they believed was the prophetic [[Messiah]]. After the [[death of Jesus]], the movement organized itself into the Jerusalem church overseen by Jesus' brother [[James the Just]].<ref name="Tabor 2006"/> 

It was during the stewardship of James, whose authority was accepted by remote communities, that [[Paul of Tarsus]] joined the movement. This eventually led to a dispute with regard to the [[Brit milah|circumcision]] of [[gentile]] converts, which Paul maintained was unnecessary. The book of the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'' records the compromise that James allegedly brokered during the [[Council of Jerusalem]] ''c''. 49 C.E., which only required that gentile converts observe [[Noahide Laws]] without having to circumcize.<ref>Acts of the Apostles 15</ref> However, in 58 C.E., Paul complains, in one of his epistles, that some of the [[twelve apostles]] of Jesus question his honesty and continue to counter his mission with their "[[Judaizers#Judaizing Teachers|judaizing teachings]]".<ref>Second Epistle to the Corinthians 11:4-5, 11:13-15, 12:11</ref> 

After the controversial execution of James in 62 C.E (which may have triggered the [[First Jewish-Roman War]] from 66 to 73 C.E.),<ref name="Eisenman 1997"/> the movement fled Jerusalem to [[Pella, Jordan]], across the Jordan river, under the stewardship of [[Simeon of Jerusalem]], another of Jesus' brothers. After Simeon's execution ''c''. 106 C.E., the Ebionites begin to disperse throughout [[Southwest Asia]], but are eclipsed by [[Pauline Christianity]], and vanish from the historical record after their encounters with the Church Fathers in the following centuries. 

The legacy of the Ebionites is debated. Once the Jerusalemite leadership of the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|mother church]] of all [[Christendom]] was decimated during [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] in 135 C.E., [[Jewish Christians]] gradually lost the struggle for the claim to being the true followers of Jesus, due to marginalization and [[Persecution of Christians#Persecution of Christians by Christians|persecution]] by both Jews and Christians.<ref name="Maccoby 1987"/> Scholar Jans-Hoachim Schoeps, however, argues that the primary influence of the Ebionites was on the [[nontrinitarian]] origins of [[Islam]] due to their exchanges with the first Muslims.<ref name="Schoeps 1969"/> 

The Ebionites might be represented in history as the sect encountered by the Muslim historian Abd al-Jabbar ''c.'' 1000 C.E., almost 500 years later than most Christian historians allow for their survival.<ref name="Pines 1966">{{cite book| author = Pines, Shlomo| title = The Jewish Christians Of The Early Centuries Of Christianity According To A New Source | publisher = Proceedings of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities II, No. 13| year = 1966 | id = ISBN 102-255-998}}</ref> An additional possible mention of surviving Ebionite communities existing in the lands of north-western [[Arabia]], specifically the cities of [[Tayma]] and Tilmas, around the 11th century, is said to be in ''Sefer Ha'masaoth,'' the "Book of the Travels" of Rabbi [[Benjamin of Tudela]], a [[sephardic]] rabbi of Spain.<ref name="Adler 1907">{{cite book| author = Adler, Marcus N.| title = The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela: Critical Text, Translation and Commentary, pp 70-72| publisher = Phillip Feldheim| year = 1907}}</ref> 12th century Muslim historian Mohammad al-Shahrastani, in his book ''Religious and Philosophical Sects'', mentions Jews living in nearby [[Medina]] and [[Hejaz]] who accepted Jesus as a prophetic figure and followed traditional Judaism, rejecting mainstream [[Christian views of Jesus|Christian views]].<ref name=" Shahrastani 1842">{{cite book| author = Shahrastani, Muhammad| title = The Book of Religious and Philosphical Sects, William Cureton edition, page 167| publisher = Gorgias Press| year = 2002}}</ref>

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several small yet competing [[new religious movement]]s, such as the [[Ebionite Jewish Community]], have emerged claiming to be revivalists of the views and practices of early Ebionites,<ref name="Self Help Guide 2006">{{cite paper|    author = Self Help Guide|    title = Jesus Christ|    date = 2006 |   url = http://selfhelp-guide.com/heros4u/jesus_christ.htm| accessdate = 2006-02-21}}</ref> although their idiosyncratic claims to authenticity cannot be verified. The [[counter-missionary]] group [[Jews for Judaism]] favorably mentions the historical Ebionites in their literature in order to argue that "[[Messianic Judaism]]", as promoted by missionary groups such as [[Jews for Jesus]], is [[Pauline Christianity]] misrepresenting itself as Judaism.<ref name="Kravitz 2001">{{cite book| author = Kravitz, Bentzion| title = The Jewish Response to Missionaries: Counter-Missionary Handbook | publisher = [[Jews for Judaism]] International | year = 2001}}</ref>

==Views and practices==
===Judaism===

Most [[patristic]] sources portray the Ebionites as traditional yet [[ascetic]] Jews, who zealously followed the [[Law of Moses]], revered [[Jerusalem]] as the holiest city,<ref>Ante-Nicene Fathers, Irenaeus</ref> and restricted [[Kashrut#Maintenance of a separate culture|table fellowship]] only to [[gentile]]s who [[Conversion to Judaism|converted to Judaism]].<ref>Ante-Nicene Fathers, Justin Martyr</ref>

===Essenism or Gnosticism?===

[[Epiphanius of Salamis]] is the only Church Father who describes some Ebionites as departing from traditional [[Jewish principles of faith]] and [[Orthopraxis|practice]]; specifically by engaging in excessive [[Mikvah|ritual bathing]],<ref>Epiphanius, Panarion 19:28-30</ref> possessing an [[angelology]] which claimed that the [[arianism|Christ is a great archangel]] who was incarnated in Jesus when he was [[adoptionism|adopted as the son of God]],<ref>Epiphanius, Panarion 30.14.5, 30.16.4</ref> opposing [[Korban|animal sacrifice]],<ref>Epiphanius, Panarion 30.16.5</ref> [[antinomianism|rejecting doctrines and traditions]] believed to have been added to the [[Law of Moses]], including scribal alterations of the texts of scripture,<ref>Epiphanius, Panarion 30.18.7-9</ref> and practicing [[Vegetarianism and religion#Judaism|religious vegetarianism]].<ref>Epiphanius, Panarion 30.22.4</ref> 

According to [[Robert Eisenman]], [[James Tabor]], [[Martin A. Larson]] and other scholars the Ebionites were therefore a messianic [[Essene]] sect within Judaism. In this view, the Ebionites originated with, and drew much of their original inspiration, [[Essene#Rules.2C customs.2C theology and beliefs|rules, customs, theology, beliefs]] and even their name from either the alleged Essene roots of [[John the Baptizer]] and [[James the Just]] or other Essene sects. The [[Qumran]] community, for example, referred to themselves by many epithets, including "the poor".<ref name="Eisenman 1997"/><ref name="Tabor 2006"/><ref name="Larson 1989">{{cite book| author = [[Martin A. Larson|Larson, Martin A]]| title = The Essene-Christian Faith| publisher = Truth Seeker| year = 1989 | id = ISBN 0-939482-16-9}}</ref> 

The reliability of Epiphanius' claims, however, is questioned by some scholars.<ref name="Klijn & Reinink 1973"/><ref name=" Van Voorst 1989">{{cite book| author = Van Voorst, Robert E.| title = The Ascents of James: History and Theology of a Jewish-Christian Community| publisher = Society of Biblical Literature| year = 1989| id = ISBN 1555402941}}</ref> [[Shlomo Pines]], for example, argues that all these [[heterodox]] views and practices originated in [[Fathers of Christian Gnosticism|Gnostic Christianity]] rather than [[Essenism]], and are characteristics of the [[Elcesaites|Elcesaite]] sect, which Epiphanius mistakenly attributed to the Ebionites.<ref name="Pines 1966"/>

===Jesus===
 
The majority of [[Church Fathers]] are in agreement in claiming that the Ebionites rejected many of the central [[Christian views of Jesus]] such as the [[pre-existence]], [[divinity of Jesus|divinity]], [[virgin birth]], [[atonement|atoning]] [[death of Jesus|death]], and [[vision hypothesis|physical resurrection of Jesus]].<ref name="Klijn & Reinink 1973"/> The Ebionites are described as emphasizing the [[unitarianism|oneness of God]] and the humanity of Jesus as the biological son of both [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], who by virtue of his [[Tzadik|righteousness]], was [[Chosen people|chosen]] by God to be the [[messiah|messianic]] "[[Prophet#Prophets in the Tanakh .28Hebrew Bible.29|prophet]] like [[Moses]]" foretold in ''[[Deuteronomy]]'' 18:14-22, when he was [[Anointing|anointed]] with the [[Shekhinah|holy spirit]] at his baptism.<ref name="Maccoby 1987"/><ref name="Tabor 1998"/>

Of the books of the [[New Testament]], the Ebionites are said to have accepted only an Aramaic version of the ''[[Gospel of Matthew]]'', referred to as the ''[[Gospel of the Hebrews]]'', as additional [[scripture]] to the [[Hebrew Bible]]. This version of ''Matthew'', [[Irenaeus]] reports, omitted the first two chapters (on the [[nativity of Jesus]]), and started with the [[baptism of Jesus]] by [[John the Baptizer|John]].<ref>Ante-Nicene Fathers, Irenaeus</ref>

Like traditional Christians, Ebionites believed Jesus invited his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] to live according to an [[Tikkun olam|ethic of social justice]] that would be standard in the future [[kingdom of God]]: Since Jesus [[revelation|revealed]] what the ethic of the [[Messianic Age]] will be, his disciples should immediately adjust their lives to this ethic in this age.<ref name="Shand 2006">{{cite paper|    author = Shand, Richard|    title = The Ministry of Jesus|    date = 2006 |   url = http://www.mystae.com/restricted/reflections/messiah/ministry.html | accessdate = 2006-12-19}}</ref> Ebionites, however, interpreted these teachings to mean that all [[Jew]]s and [[gentile]]s must observe the [[613 mitzvot|commandments]] in the [[Law of Moses]],<ref>Ante-Nicene Fathers, Justin Martyr</ref> in order to become [[Tzadik|righteous]] and seek [[Devekut|communion with God]];<ref>Ante-Nicene Fathers, Hippolytus</ref> but that these commandments must be understood in the light of Jesus' [[expounding of the Law]],<ref name="Tabor 1998"/> which he is said to have revealed during his [[Sermon on the Mount|sermon on the mount]].<ref name="Viljoen 2006">{{cite paper|    author = Viljoen, Francois P.|    title = Jesus' Teaching on the Torah in the Sermon on the Mount|    date = 2006 |   url = http://www.geocities.com/neotestamentica/archive/401/401gviljoen-sample.pdf | accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref> The Ebionites may have held a form of "[[inaugurated eschatology]]" positing that the [[ministry of Jesus]] had ushered in the Messianic Age so that the kingdom of God might be understood as present in an incipient fashion, while at the same time awaiting consummation in the [[world to come|future age]].<ref name="Maccoby 1987"/><ref name="Tabor 1998"/>

===John the Baptizer===

In one excerpt from the so-called ''[[Gospel of the Ebionites]]'' collected by [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], [[John the Baptizer]] is portrayed as a [[Vegetarianism and religion|vegetarian]] [[Nazirite]] [[Teacher of Righteousness|teacher]] and a forerunner to Jesus. Scholars argue that [[Jewish Christians]] viewed the ministry of John as an alternative to what they perceived to be the culture of corruption surrounding the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].<ref name="Eisenman 1997"/><ref name="Tabor 2006"/><ref name="Larson 1989"/>

===James the Just===

Although he is not mentioned in [[patristic]] sources for the Ebionites, [[James the Just]], the brother of Jesus, was the hereditary leader of the [[Jerusalem church]]; followed by other members of the [[Desposyni]] (the blood relatives of Jesus) who many [[Jewish Christians]] regarded as the legitimate [[Apostolic Succession|apostolic successors]] to James as [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem#Bishops of Jerusalem|patriarchs of the Jerusalem church]], rather than [[Saint Peter|Peter]]. Jewish Christians also viewed James as the legitimate [[Kohen Gadol|high priest of Israel]], by virtue of his [[Tzadik|righteousness]], in opposition to the high priest recognized by the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name="Eisenman 1997"/><ref name="Tabor 2006"/><ref name="Larson 1989"/>

===Paul of Tarsus===

[[Patristic]] sources report Ebionites as denouncing [[Paul of Tarsus]] as an [[apostate]] from the Law,<ref>Ante-Nicene Fathers, Irenaeus</ref> for his slander of the [[pillars of the church]], and condemnation of their "[[Judaizers#Judaizing Teachers|judaizing teachings]]" as a threat to the spread of his [[schism (religion)|schismatic religion]].<ref>Second Epistle to the Corinthians 11:5, 11:13-15, 12:11</ref> [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] claims that some Ebionites fought back by [[gossip]]ing that Paul was a Greek who converted to Judaism in order to marry the daughter of ([[Annas]]?) a [[Kohen Gadol|high priest of Israel]], apostasized when she rejected him;<ref>Epiphanius, Panarion 16.9</ref> and later, according to scholar [[Hyam Maccoby]], developed the early Christian church as a [[Gnosticism and the New Testament#The Pauline Epistles|Gnostic Jewish mystery religion]].<ref name="Maccoby 1987"/>

==Writings==

Few writings of the Ebionites have survived, and these are in uncertain form.  The [[Clementine literature|''Recognitions of Clement'' and the ''Clementine Homilies'']], two 3rd-century Christian works, are regarded by general scholarly consensus as largely or entirely [[Jewish Christians|Jewish Christian]] in origin and reflect Jewish Christian ideology. These can be found in volume 8 of the Ante-Nicene Fathers.  The exact relationship between the Ebionites and these writings is debated, but [[Talk:Ebionites/Sources|Epiphanius's description of some Ebionites in ''Panarion'' 30]] bears repeated and striking similarity to the ideas in the ''Recognitions'' and ''Homilies''. Scholar Glenn Alan Koch speculates that Epiphanius likely relied upon a version of the ''Homilies'' as a source document.<ref name="Koch 1976"/>

The 1908 [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] mentions four classes of Ebionite writings:<ref name="Arendzen 1909">{{cite encyclopedia|    title = Ebionites|    encyclopedia = [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|    volume = V|    pages|    publisher =  Robert Appleton Company|    date = 1909|    accessdate = 2007-03-13}}</ref>
* ''[[Gospel of the Ebionites]]''. According to [[Irenaeus]], the Ebionites used only the ''[[Gospel of Matthew]]''. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] (''Historia Ecclesiae'' IV, xxi, 8) mentions a ''[[Gospel of the Hebrews]]'', often identified as the Aramaic original of Matthew, written with Hebrew letters. Such a work was known to [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]] (according to Eusebius, ''Historia Eccl''., ), [[Origen]] (according to [[Jerome's De Viris Illustribus|Jerome's De viris illustribus ii]], and to [[Clement of Alexandria]] (''Strom.'', II, ix, 45). [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] attributes this gospel to [[Nazarenes]], and claims that Ebionites only possessed an incomplete, falsified, and truncated copy. (''[[Adversus Haereses]]'', xxix, 9). The question remains whether or not Epiphanius was able to make a genuine distinction between Nazarenes and Ebionites.
* [[New Testament apocrypha]]: The ''Circuits of Peter'' and ''Acts of the Apostles'', including the work usually titled the ''Ascents of James''. The first-named books are substantially contained in the Homilies of Clement under the title of Clement's ''Compendium of Peter's itinerary sermons'', and also in the ''Recognitions'' attributed to Clement. They form an early Christian didactic fiction to express Jewish Christian views, i.e. the primacy of [[James the Just]], their connection with the [[Holy See|episcopal see of Rome]], and their antagonism to [[Simon Magus]], as well as [[gnostic]] doctrines. Scholar Robert Van Voorst opines of the ''Ascents of James'' (R 1.33-71), "There is, in fact, no section of the Clementine literature about whose origin in Jewish Christianity one may be more certain".<ref name=" Van Voorst 1989"/> Despite this assertion, he expresses reservations that the material is genuinely Ebionite in origin. 
* The Works of [[Symmachus the Ebionite]], i.e. his [[Koine Greek]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]], used by Jerome, fragments of which exist, and his lost ''[[Hypomnemata]]'', written to counter the canonical Gospel of Matthew. The latter work, which is totally lost (Eusebius, ''Hist. Eccl.'', VI, xvii; Jerome, ''De vir.'' ill., liv), is probably identical with ''De distinctione pr<U+00E6>ceptorum'', mentioned by Ebed Jesu (Assemani, ''Bibl. Or.'', III, 1).
* The ''Book of Elchesai'' (Elxai), or of "The Hidden power", claimed to have been written about 100 CE and brought to Rome in c. 217 CE by Alcibiades of Apamea. Ebionites who accepted its gnostic doctrines were judged to be [[apostate]]s and called [[Elcesaites]]. (Hipp., ''Philos.'', IX, xiv-xvii; Epiphanius., ''Adv. Haer.'', xix, 1; liii, 1.)

It is also speculated that the core of the ''[[Gospel of Barnabas]]'', beneath a polemical medieval [[Islam|Muslim]] overlay, may have been based upon an Ebionite or gnostic document.<ref name="Toland 1718">{{cite book| author = [[John Toland|Toland, John]]| title = Nazarenus, or Jewish, Gentile and Mahometan Christianity| publisher = <U+2026> | year = 1718}}</ref> The existence and origin of this source continues to be debated by scholars.<ref name=" Blackhirst 2000">{{cite paper|    author = Blackhirst, R.|    title = Barnabas and the Gospels: Was There an Early Gospel of Barnabas?, J. Higher Criticism, 7/1, pp 1-22|    date = 2000|   url = http://depts.drew.edu/jhc/Blackhirst_Barnabas.html| accessdate = 2007-03-11}}</ref>

==Archaeology==
In his 2004 book ''Buried Angels'', biblical scholar Jacob Rabinowitz suggests that a body of archaeological evidence discovered by Franciscan [[biblical archaeology|biblical archaeologists]] in [[Jerusalem]], [[Hebron]] and [[Nazareth]] may be a record of the original Ebionite community. The items, consisting of [[ossuary|ossuaries]], figures and ritual objects, incorporate [[Christian cross|the cross]] as a decorative motif combined with other biblical symbols. The Franciscans describe the finds as the work of a late 3rd or 4th century heretical judaizing sect, but since the dating is very approximate, the material could as well be 1st century. The objects themselves may be significant examples of [[early Christian art and architecture|early Christian art]], whatever their exact date, and Rabinowitz' argument, supported by citations of [[New Testament]], [[Church Fathers|patristic]], and [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] material, and in accord with the visual evidence, are notable.<ref name=" Rabinowitz 2004">{{cite book| author = Rabinowitz, Jacob | title = [http://www.invisiblebooks.com/Angels.pdf Buried Angels]| publisher = Invisible Books | year = 2004}}</ref>
