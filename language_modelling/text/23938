'''American football''' (known as '''football''' in the [[United States]] and '''gridiron''' in some other countries) is a [[team sport|sport]] played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field 120 [[yards]] long by 53.33 yards wide with goalposts at each end. The [[offense (sports)|offense]] attempts to advance an oval ball (the [[Football (ball)#American and Canadian football|football]])<ref name="Oxford">{{cite web|url=http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/american-football|title=American football|work=[[Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=November 18, 2012}}</ref> down the field by [[Rush (gridiron football)|running]] with or [[Forward pass#American and Canadian football|passing]] it. They must advance it at least ten yards in four [[Down (gridiron football)|downs]] to receive a new set of four downs and continue the drive; if not, they [[turnover on downs|turn over]] the football to the opposing team. Most points are scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a [[touchdown]] or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|field goal]]. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.

American football evolved in the United States, originating from the sport of [[rugby football]]. The first game of American football was played on [[1869 New Jersey vs. Rutgers football game|November 6, 1869]], between two college teams, [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers]] and [[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton]], under rules resembling rugby and [[association football|soccer]]. A set of rule changes drawn up from [[1880 college football season|1880]] onward by [[Walter Camp]], the "Father of American Football", established the [[snap (gridiron football)|snap]], eleven-player teams and the concept of downs, and later rule changes legalized the [[forward pass]], created the [[neutral zone (gridiron football)|neutral zone]] and specified the size and shape of the football.

American football as a whole is the most popular [[sport in the United States]]; [[professional football (gridiron)|professional football]] and [[college football]] are the most popular forms of the game, with the other major levels being [[high school football|high school]] and youth football. The NFL's championship game, the [[Super Bowl]], is the most popular single-day sporting event in the United States and among the most-watched club sporting events in the world.

==History==
{{Main|History of American football}}

===Early history===
American football evolved from the sport of [[rugby football]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugby.neu.edu/PDF/guide.pdf|title=Spectators Guide to Rugby|publisher=New England Rugby. [[Northeastern University]]|format=PDF|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}</ref> The first American football game was played on [[1869 New Jersey vs. Rutgers football game|November 6, 1869]] between [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers]] and [[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton]]. The game was played between two teams of 25 players each, used a round ball, and resembled a combination of rugby and [[association football|soccer]] in its rules; the ball could not be picked up or carried, but it could be kicked or batted with the feet, hands, head or sides, with the ultimate goal of advancing it into the opponent's goal. Rutgers won the game 6-4.<ref name="Rutgers">{{cite web|url=http://scarletknights.com/football/history/first-game.asp|title=Rutgers - The Birthplace of Intercollegiate Football|publisher=[[Rutgers University]]|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}</ref><ref name="No Christian End">{{cite journal|title=No Christian End! The Beginnings of Football in America|publisher=[[Professional Football Researchers Association]]|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/No_Christian_End.pdf|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}</ref>

Collegiate play continued for several years in which matches were played using the rules of the host school. Representatives of Yale, [[Columbia University|Columbia]], Princeton and Rutgers met on October 19, 1873 to create a standard set of rules for all schools to adhere to. Teams were set at 20 players each, and fields of 400 by 250 feet were specified. Harvard abstained from the conference, as they favored a rugby-style game that allowed running with the ball.<ref name="No Christian End" />

An 1875 Harvard-Yale game played under rugby-style rules was observed by two impressed Princeton athletes. These players introduced the sport to Princeton, a feat the [[Professional Football Researchers Association]] compared to "selling [[refrigerator]]s to [[Eskimo]]s."<ref name="No Christian End" /> Princeton, Harvard, Yale and Columbia then agreed to intercollegiate play using a form of [[rugby union]] rules with a modified scoring system.<ref name="Camp and His Followers" /> These schools formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, although Yale did not join until 1879. Yale player [[Walter Camp]], now regarded as the "Father of American Football,"<ref name="Heroes of Football">{{cite book|last=Madden|first=John|author2=Bill Gutman|title=John Madden's Heroes of Football: The Story of America's Game|publisher=[[Dutton Children's Books]]|year=2006|page=7|isbn=0-525-47698-9}}</ref> passed rule changes in 1880 that reduced the team size from 15 to 11 players and instituted the [[snap (gridiron football)|snap]] to replace the chaotic and inconsistent [[scrum (rugby)|scrum]].<ref name="Camp and His Followers"/>

===Evolution of the game===

[[File:Walter Camp - Project Gutenberg eText 18048.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A photograph of [[Walter Camp]], the "Father of American Football", taken from 1878 when Camp was captain of [[Yale University|Yale]]'s football team]]
The introduction of the snap resulted in unexpected strategy changes. Previously, the strategy had been to punt if a scrum resulted in bad field position. A group of Princeton players realized that, as the snap was uncontested, they now could hold the ball indefinitely to prevent their opponent from scoring. In 1881, both contestants in a Yale-Princeton game used this strategy to maintain their undefeated records. Each team held the ball, gaining no ground, for an entire half. This "block game" proved extremely unpopular with spectators and fans of both teams.<ref name="Camp and His Followers" />

A rule change was necessary to prevent this strategy, and a reversion to the scrum was considered until Camp passed a rule in 1882 that stated that a team would have three [[down (gridiron football)|downs]], or tackles, to advance the ball five [[yard]]s. Failure to do so would forfeit control of the ball to the other team. This change made American football a separate sport from rugby, and the resulting five-yard lines added to the field made it resemble a [[gridiron (cooking)|gridiron]] in appearance. Other major rules changes included a reduction of the field size to 110 yards [[yards]] long by 53.33 yards wide, and the adoption of a scoring system that awarded four points for a touchdown, two for a safety and a [[Conversion (gridiron football)|goal following a touchdown]], and five for a [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|goal from field]]. In 1888 tackling below the waist was legalized.<ref name="Camp and His Followers">{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Camp_And_Followers.pdf|title=Camp and His Followers|publisher=[[Professional Football Researchers Association]]|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}</ref>

Football remained a violent sport despite these innovations. Dangerous mass-formations like the [[flying wedge]] resulted in serious injuries and occasional deaths among players.<ref>Bennett (1976), pp 20</ref> A 1905 peak of 19 fatalities nationwide resulted in a threat by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to abolish the game unless major changes were made.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=Guy M. |year=1969 |title=Teddy Roosevelt's Role in the 1905 Football Controversy |journal=The Research Quarterly |volume=40 |pages=717<U+2013>724 }}</ref> Sixty-two schools met in New York City to discuss rule changes on December 28, 1905, and these proceedings resulted in the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later named the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA).<ref name=NCAA>{{cite web|title=The History of the NCAA|publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]|url=http://www.ncaa.org/about/history.html |accessdate=November 24, 2012|archiveurl =//web.archive.org/web/20070430205324/http://www.ncaa.org/about/history.html|archivedate=April 30, 2007}}</ref>

The legal [[forward pass]] was introduced in 1906 after its suggestion by [[John Heisman]], although its impact was limited due to the restrictions placed on its use. Further 1906 rules changes included the reduction of the time of play from 70 to 60 minutes and the increase of the distance requirement for a first down to 10 yards over three downs. To reduce infighting and dirty play between teams, the [[Neutral zone (gridiron football)|neutral zone]] was created along the width of the football.<ref name="Blondy Wallace and the Biggest Football Scandal Ever: 1906">{{cite journal|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/06-An-209.pdf|title=Blondy Wallace and the Biggest Football Scandal Ever: 1906|last1=Braunwart|last1=Carroll|first1=Bob|journal=The Coffin Corner|publisher=[[Professional Football Researchers Association]]|accessdate=November 25, 2012}}</ref> Field goals were lowered to three points in 1909<ref name=NFL1911>{{cite web|title=NFL History 1869<U+2013>1910|publisher=[[NFL.com]]|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080102045951/http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1869-1910#1892|archivedate=January 2, 2008|accessdate=November 24, 2012|url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1869-1910#1892}}</ref> and touchdowns raised to six points in 1912.<ref name=NFL1911>{{cite web|title=NFL History 1911<U+2013>1920|publisher=[[NFL.com]]|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080115043331/http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1911-1920#1920|archivedate=January 15, 2008|accessdate=November 24, 2012|url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1911-1920#1920}}</ref> The field was also reduced to 100 yards long, but two 10-yard-long end zones were created, and teams were given four downs instead of three to advance the ball 10 yards.<ref name="Danzig1956">{{cite book |title=The History of American Football: Its Great Teams, Players, and Coaches |last=Danzig |first=Allison |authorlink= |year=1956 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. |isbn= |pages=70<U+2013>71 }}</ref> The roughing-the-passer penalty was implemented in 1914, and eligible players were first allowed to catch the ball anywhere on the field in 1918.<ref>Vancil (2000) pp 22</ref>

===The professional era===

[[File:Pudge heffelfinger.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[William Heffelfinger|William "Pudge" Heffelfinger]], widely regarded as the first professional football player]]
The first instance of [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional play in American football]] was on November 12, 1892, when [[William Heffelfinger|William "Pudge" Heffelfinger]] was paid $500 to play a game for the [[Allegheny Athletic Association]] in a match against the [[Pittsburgh Athletic Club (football)|Pittsburgh Athletic Club]]. This is the first recorded instance of a player being paid to participate in a game of American football, although many athletic clubs in the 1880s offered to help players attain employment, gave out trophies or watches that players would pawn for money, or paid double in expense money. Despite these extra benefits, the game had a strict sense of amateurism at the time, and direct payment to players was frowned upon, if not outright illegal.<ref name=birth>{{cite web|title = The Birth of Pro Football| publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] | url = http://www.profootballhof.com/history/general/birth.jsp | accessdate =March 19, 2013}}</ref>

Over time, professional play became increasingly common, and with it came rising salaries and unpredictable player movement, as well as the illegal payment of college players who were still in school. The [[National Football League]] (NFL), a group of professional teams that was originally established in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association, aimed to solve these problems. This new league's stated goals included an end to bidding wars over players, prevention of the use of college players, and abolition of the practice of paying players to leave another team.<ref name="The First 25 Years">{{cite journal|last=Clary|first=Jack|year=1994|title=The First 25 Years|journal=The Coffin Corner|publisher=[[Professional Football Researchers Association]]|volume=16|issue=4|pages=1, 4<U+2013>5|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/16-04-570.pdf}}</ref> The NFL by 1922 had established itself as the premier professional football league.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sports Capitalism: The Foreign Business of American Professional Leagues|first=Frank P.|last=Jozsa| publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|year=2004| isbn=978-0-7546-4185-8|page=270|quote=Since 1922, [the NFL] has been the top professional sports league in the world with respect to American football}}</ref>

The dominant form of football at the time was played at the [[college football|collegiate level]], but the upstart NFL received a boost to its legitimacy in 1925 when an NFL team, the [[Pottsville Maroons]], defeated a team of [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] all-stars in an [[1925 NFL Championship controversy#Background|exhibition game]].<ref name="The Curse">{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2007-01-11/news/the-curse/full|title=The Curse|last=Nelson|first=Robert|date=January 11, 2007|work=[[Phoenix New Times]]|accessdate=January 30, 2013}}</ref> A greater emphasis on the passing game helped professional football to further distinguish itself from the college game during the late 1930s.<ref name="The First 25 Years" /> Football in general became increasingly popular following the [[1958 NFL Championship game]], a match between the [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] and the [[New York Giants]] that is still referred to as the "Greatest Game Ever Played". The game, a 23<U+2013>17 overtime victory by the Colts, was seen by millions of television viewers and had a major impact on the popularity of the sport. This helped football to become the most popular sport in the United States by the mid-1960s.<ref name="Greatest game ever played">{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/release.aspx?release_id=1805|title=Greatest game ever played|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=March 20, 2013}}</ref>

A rival, the [[American Football League]] (AFL), arose in 1960 and challenged the NFL's dominance. The AFL began in relative obscurity but survived for several years due to a television contract with the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network. Competition for players heated up in 1965, when the AFL [[New York Jets]] signed rookie [[Joe Namath]] to a then-record US $437,000 contract. A five-year, $40 million [[NBC]] television contract followed, which helped to sustain the young league. The bidding war for players ended in 1966, when the two leagues agreed on [[AFL-NFL merger|a merger]] that would take full effect in 1970. This agreement provided for a common draft that would take place each year, and it instituted an annual championship game to be played between the champions of each league. That game began play in 1966 and came to be known as the [[Super Bowl]].<ref name="The Second 25 Years">{{cite journal|last=Clary|first=Jack|year=1994|title=The Second 25 Years|journal=The Coffin Corner|publisher=[[Professional Football Researchers Association]]|volume=16|issue=5|pages=4<U+2013>5|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/16-05-575.pdf}}</ref>

College football maintained a tradition of postseason [[bowl games]]. Each bowl game would be associated with a particular conference, and earning a spot in a bowl game was the reward for winning a conference. This arrangement was profitable, but it tended to prevent the two top-ranked teams from meeting in a true national championship game, as they would normally be committed to the bowl games of their respective conferences. Several systems have been used since 1992 to determine a national champion of college football. The first was the [[Bowl Coalition]], in place from 1992 to 1994. This was replaced in 1995 by the [[Bowl Alliance]], which gave way in 1997 to the [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS).<ref name=BCS>{{cite web | title = BCS Chronology |publisher=FOX Sports on MSN| year = 2006 | url = http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/history | accessdate =March 19, 2013|archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20070915010233/http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/history |archivedate = September 15, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The BCS arrangement has been [[BCS controversies|controversial]], and will be replaced in 2014 by a [[College Football Playoff|four-team playoff system]].<ref name="Presidents get playoff plan right">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8099205/college-football-time-celebrate-approval-four-team-playoff|title=Presidents get playoff plan right|author=[[Gene Wojciechowski|Wojciechowski, Jean]]|date=June 26, 2012|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=March 20, 2013}}</ref>

Football is the most popular sport in the United States. In a 2013 poll conducted by [[Harris Interactive]], professional and college football were the first and third most popular sports, respectively, and 45% of participants ranked some form of the game as their favorite sport; professional football has ranked as the most popular sport in the poll since 1965, when it surpassed [[baseball]] for the first time.<ref name="The Harris Poll: NFL continues 47-year run as America's most popular sport">{{cite web|url=http://nflcommunications.com/2013/01/17/the-harris-poll-nfl-continues-47-year-run-as-americas-most-popular-sport/|title=The Harris Poll: NFL continues 47-year run as America's most popular sport|date=January 17, 2013|publisher=NFL Communications|accessdate=March 20, 2013}}</ref> The Super Bowl is the most popular single-day sporting event in the United States<ref name="The Second 25 Years" /> and is among the biggest club sporting events in the world.<ref name="Elite clubs on Uefa gravy train as Super Bowl knocked off perch">{{cite news|title=Elite clubs on Uefa gravy train as Super Bowl knocked off perch|last=Harris|first=Nick|date=January 31, 2010|work=[[The Independent]]|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/elite-clubs-on-uefa-gravy-train-as-super-bowl-knocked-off-perch-1884429.html|accessdate=November 28, 2012}}</ref>

====Backs and backfield====
[[File:Hurricanes Quarterback.JPG|thumb|A quarterback under center, ready to take the snap]]
The main backfield positions are the [[quarterback]] (QB), [[halfback (American football)|halfback/tailback]] (HB/TB) and [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] (FB). The quarterback is the leader of the offense. Either he or a coach calls the plays. Quarterbacks typically inform the rest of the offense of the play in the [[Huddle#American football|huddle]] before the team lines up. The quarterback lines up behind the center to take the snap and then hands the ball off, throws it or runs with it.<ref name="NFL in a nutshell" />

The primary role of the halfback, who is also known as the tailback, is to carry the ball on running plays. Halfbacks may also serve as receivers. Fullbacks tend to be larger than halfbacks and function primarily as blockers, but they are sometimes used as runners in short-yardage situations<ref name="Football Players' Roles in Team Offense and Defense">{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/football-players-roles-in-team-offense-and-defense.html|title=Football Players' Roles in Team Offense and Defense|publisher=[[For Dummies|Dummies.com]]|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}</ref> and often are not used in passing situations.<ref name="Fullbacks back en vogue">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=5238185|title=Fullbacks back en vogue|last=Pasquarelli|first=Len|date=June 1, 2010|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=November 22, 2012}}</ref>

The [[Lineman (American football)|offensive line]] consists of several players whose primary function is to [[Blocking (American football)|block]] members of the defensive line from tackling the ball carrier on running plays or [[Quarterback sack|sacking]] the quarterback on passing plays.<ref name="Football Players' Roles in Team Offense and Defense" /> The leader of the offensive line is the [[Center (gridiron football)|center]] (C), who is responsible for snapping the ball to the quarterback, blocking,<ref name="Football Players' Roles in Team Offense and Defense" /> and for making sure that the other linemen do their jobs during the play.<ref name="Centers: The Unsung Heroes of Football">{{cite web|url=http://www.active.com/football/Articles/Centers-The-Unsung-Heroes-of-Football|title=Centers: The Unsung Heroes of Football|last=Wood|first=Ryan|publisher=Active.com|accessdate=November 22, 2012}}</ref> On either side of the center are the [[Guard (gridiron football)|guards]] (G), while [[Tackle (gridiron football)#Offensive tackle|tackles]] (T) line up outside of the guards.

====Receivers====
[[File:Santana moss leaping catch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Washington Redskins]] wide receiver [[Santana Moss]] catches a pass over two [[Atlanta Falcons]] defenders.]]
The principal receivers are the [[wide receiver]]s (WR) and the [[tight end]]s (TE).<ref name="Football's Offensive Team: The Receivers">{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/footballs-offensive-team-the-receivers.html|title=Football's Offensive Team: The Receivers|last1=Long|first1=Howie|last2=Czarnecki|first2=John|authorlink1=Howie Long|publisher=[[For Dummies|Dummies.com]]|accessdate=November 22, 2012}}</ref> Wide receivers line up on or near the line of scrimmage, split outside of the line. The main goal of the wide receiver is to catch passes thrown by the quarterback,<ref name="Football Players' Roles in Team Offense and Defense" /> but they may also function as decoys or as blockers during running plays. Tight ends line up outside of the tackles and function both as receivers and as blockers.<ref name="Football Players' Roles in Team Offense and Defense" />

===Defensive unit===
[[File:Arian Foster fumble.jpg|thumb|[[Dallas Cowboys]] defensive players force [[Houston Texans]] running back [[Arian Foster]] to fumble the ball.]]
The role of the defense is to prevent the offense from scoring by [[Tackle (gridiron football)|tackling]] the ball carrier or by forcing [[Turnover (gridiron football)|turnovers]] ([[interception]]s or [[fumble]]s).<ref name="NFL in a nutshell" />

====Defensive line====
The [[Lineman (American football)|defensive line]] consists of [[defensive end]]s (DE) and [[defensive tackle]]s (DT). Defensive ends line up on the ends of the line, while defensive tackles line up inside, between the defensive ends. The primary responsibilities of defensive ends and defensive tackles is to stop running plays on the inside and outside, respectively, to pressure the quarterback on passing plays, and to occupy the line so that the [[linebackers]] can break through.<ref name="Football Players' Roles in Team Offense and Defense" />

====Linebackers====
Linebackers line up behind the defensive line but in front of the defensive backfield. They are divided into two types: middle linebackers (MLB) and outside linebackers (OLB). Linebackers are the defensive leaders and call the defensive plays. Their diverse roles include defending the run, pressuring the quarterback, and guarding backs, wide receivers and tight ends in the passing game.<ref name="Football's Defensive Team: The Linebackers">{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/footballs-defense-team-the-linebackers.html|title=Football's Defensive Team: The Linebackers|last1=Long|first1=Howie|last2=Czarnecki|first2=John|authorlink1=Howie Long|publisher=[[For Dummies|Dummies.com]]|accessdate=November 23, 2012}}</ref>

====Defensive backfield====
[[File:Brent Grimes-Hamburg Sea Devils.jpg|thumb|left|Cornerback [[Brent Grimes]] of the [[Hamburg Sea Devils]] intercepts a pass.]]
The [[defensive back]]field, often called the "secondary," consists of [[cornerback]]s (CB) and [[Safety (gridiron football position)|safeties]] (S). Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS).<ref name="Football Players' Roles in Team Offense and Defense" /> Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, typically opposite of a receiver so as to be able to cover him, while safeties line up between the cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary. Safeties are the last line of defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.<ref name="Football Players' Roles in Team Offense and Defense" />

===Special teams unit===
The special teams unit are responsible for all kicking plays. The special teams unit of the team in control of the ball will try and execute field goal attempts, punts and kickoffs, while the opposing's unit will aim to block or return them.<ref name="NFL in a nutshell" />

====Field goals and kickoffs====
[[File:Jeff Reed kickoff 2006.jpg|thumb|Kicker [[Jeff Reed (American football)|Jeff Reed]] of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] executes a kickoff.]]
Three positions are specific to the field goal and PAT (point after touchdown)  unit: the [[placekicker]] (K or PK), [[Holder (American football)|holder]] (H) and [[long snapper]] (LS). The long snapper's job is to snap the football to the holder, who will catch and position it for the placekicker. There is not usually a holder on kickoffs, because the ball is kicked off of a tee; however, a holder may be used in certain situations, such as if wind is preventing the ball from remaining upright on the tee. The player on the receiving team who catches the ball is known as the [[kickoff returner]] (KR).<ref name="The Role of Special Teams in a Football Game">{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/the-role-of-special-teams-in-a-football-game.html|title=The Role of Special Teams in a Football Game|last1=Long|first1=Howie|last2=Czarnecki|first2=John|authorlink1=Howie Long|publisher=[[For Dummies|Dummies.com]]|accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

====Punts and punt returners====
The positions specific to punt plays are the [[punter (football)|punter]] (P), long snapper, and [[Gunner (American football)|gunner]]. The long snapper snaps the football directly to the punter, who then drops and kicks it before it hits the ground. Gunners line up split outside of the line and race down the field, aiming to tackle the [[punt returner]] (PR) - the player that catches the punt.<ref name="Football Special Teams: Players on a Punt Team">{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/football-special-teams-players-on-a-punt-team.html|title=Football Special Teams: Players on a Punt Team|last1=Long|first1=Howie|last2=Czarnecki|first2=John|authorlink1=Howie Long|publisher=[[For Dummies|Dummies.com]]|accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

==Rules==

[[File:2006 Navy - Tusla.jpg|thumb|A player (dark jersey) scores a touchdown while a defender (in white) looks on. The goal line is marked by the small orange pylon.]]

===Scoring===
In American football, the winner is the team that has scored the most points at the end of the game. There are multiple ways to score in a football game.

The [[touchdown]], worth six points, is the most valuable scoring play in American football. A touchdown is scored when a live ball is advanced into, caught in, or recovered in the end zone of the opposing team.<ref name="NFL in a nutshell" /> The scoring team then attempts a [[try]] or [[Conversion (gridiron football)|conversion]], more commonly known as the point(s)-after-touchdown (PAT), which is a single scoring opportunity. A PAT is attempted from the two- or three-yard line, depending on the level of play. If scored by a placekick or dropkick through the goal posts, it is worth one point, and is typically called the extra point.<ref name="Duke">{{cite journal|last=Sackrowitz|first=Harold|year=2000|title=Re<U+FB01>ning the Point(s)-After-Touchdown Decision|journal=Department of Statistical Science|publisher=[[Duke University]]|volume=13|issue=3|pages=29<U+2013>30, 33<U+2013>34|url=http://www.stat.duke.edu/~dalene/chance/chanceweb/133.sackrowitz.pdf|accessdate=October 23, 2012}}</ref> If it is scored by what would normally be a touchdown, it is called the [[two-point conversion]]<ref name="Duke" /> and is worth two points.

A [[Field goal (gridiron football)|field goal]], worth three points, is scored when the ball is placekicked or dropkicked through the uprights and over the crossbars of the defense's goalposts.<ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. 57-59">NFL Rules 2012, p.&nbsp;57<U+2013>59.</ref><ref name="NCAA Rules 2011-2012, p. 79-80">NCAA Rules 2011<U+2013>2012, p.&nbsp;79<U+2013>80.</ref><ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, p. 66">NFHS Rules 2012, p. 66.</ref> After a PAT attempt or successful field goal the scoring team must kick the ball off to the other team.<ref name="Beginner's Guide to Football">{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/beginnersguidetofootball|title=Beginner's Guide to Football|publisher=[[National Football League]]|accessdate=September 30, 2012}}</ref> A [[Safety (gridiron football score)|safety]] is worth two points and is scored by the defense. It occurs when the ball carrier is tackled in his own end zone.<ref name="NFL in a nutshell" /> After a safety has been scored, the team that conceded the safety must return the ball to the scoring team via a [[Safety kick#Resuming play after a safety|free kick]], which in professional football often resembles a punt.<ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. 60">NFL Rules 2012, p. 60</ref>

===Field===

[[File:Edward Jones Dome endzone view.jpg|left|thumb|A football field as seen from behind one end zone. The tall, yellow goal posts mark where the ball must pass for a successful field goal or extra point. The large, rectangular area marked with the team name is the end zone.]]

Football games are played on a rectangular field that measures 120 [[yard]]s (110 [[meter]]s) long and 53.33 yards (48.76 m) wide. Lines marked along the ends and sides of the field are known respectively as the end lines and side lines, and goal lines are marked 10 yards (9 m) outward from each end line. Weighted pylons are placed on the inside corner of the intersections of the goal lines and end lines.

White markings on the field identify the distance from the end zone. Inbound lines, or [[hash marks]], are short parallel lines that mark off one-yard increments. Yard lines, which run the width of the field, are marked every five yards. A line one yard wide is placed at each end of the field. This line is marked at the center of the two-yard line in professional play and at the three-yard line in college play. Numerals that display the yard lines in multiples of ten are placed along both sides of the field.<ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. v, 1">NFL Rules 2012, p. v, 1.</ref><ref name="NCAA Rules 2011-2012, p. 18-19, 23-24">NCAA Rules 2011<U+2013>2012, p.&nbsp;18<U+2013>19, 23-24.</ref><ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, p. 11-12, 13, 28">NFHS Rules 2012, p.&nbsp;11<U+2013>12, 13, 28.</ref>

Goalposts are at the center of the plane of each of the two end lines. The crossbar of these posts is ten [[foot (unit)|feet]] (3 meters) above the ground, with vertical uprights at the end of the crossbar 18 feet 6 [[inch]]es (6 m) apart for professional and collegiate play and 23 feet 4 inches (7 m) apart for high school play.<ref name="Sonar Domes">{{cite web|title=Sports Know How|url=http://www.sportsknowhow.com/football/field-dimensions/nfl-football-field-dimensions.html|work=Professional (NFL) Football Field Dimension Diagram|publisher=http://www.sportsknowhow.com|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> The uprights extend vertically 10 yards on professional fields, a minimum of 10 yards on college fields, and a minimum of ten feet on high school fields. Goal posts are padded at the base, and orange ribbons are normally placed at the tip of each upright.<ref name="NCAA Rules 2011-2012, p. 18">NCAA Rules 2011<U+2013>2012, p. 18.</ref><ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. 2">NFL Rules 2012, p. 2.</ref><ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, p. 14">NFHS Rules 2012, p. 14.</ref>

===Duration and time stoppages===

The visiting team is allowed to call 'heads' or 'tails'; the winner of the toss is allowed to decide from between choosing whether to receive or kick off the ball or choosing which goal they want to defend, but they can also defer their choice until the second half. The losing team, unless the winning team decides to defer, is allowed to choose the option the winning team did not select, and receives the option to receive, kick, or select a goal to defend to begin the second half. Most teams choose to receive or defer, because choosing to kick the ball to start the game would allow the other team to choose which goal to defend.<ref name="TMQ's all-haiku NFL preview">{{cite web|title=TMQ's all-haiku NFL preview|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=easterbrook/080902|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=October 1, 2013|author=[[Gregg Easterbrook|Easterbrook, Gregg]]|date=September 4, 2008}}</ref> Teams switch goals following the first and third quarters.<ref name="How Football Game Time Is Measured in Quarters">{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-football-game-time-is-measured-in-quarters.html|title=How Football Game Time Is Measured in Quarters|publisher=[[For Dummies|Dummies.com]]|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}</ref> If a down is in progress when a quarter ends, play continues until the down is completed.<ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. 14-18">NFL Rules 2012, p.&nbsp;14<U+2013>18</ref><ref name="NCAA Rules 2011-2012, p. 47-53">NCAA Rules 2011<U+2013>2012, p.&nbsp;47<U+2013>53.</ref><ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, p. 38-45">NFHS Rules 2012, p.&nbsp;38<U+2013>45</ref>

===Advancing the ball and downs===

[[File:Delhomme goes deep.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carolina Panthers]] quarterback [[Jake Delhomme]] (number 17) in the motion of throwing a forward pass.]]

There are two main ways that the offense can advance the ball: [[Rush (gridiron football)|running]] and [[Forward pass#American and Canadian football|passing]]. In a typical play, the quarterback calls the play, and the center passes the ball backwards and under his legs to the quarterback in a process known as the [[Snap (American and Canadian football)|snap]]. The quarterback then either hands the ball off to a back, throws the ball or runs with it himself. The play ends when the player with the ball is tackled or goes out of bounds, or a pass hits the ground without a player having caught it. A forward pass can only be legally attempted if the passer is behind the line of scrimmage.<ref name="Beginner's Guide to Football" />

The offense is given a series of four plays, known as [[Down (American and Canadian football)|downs]]. If the offense advances ten or more yards in the four downs, they are awarded a new set of four downs. If they fail to advance ten yards, possession of the football is turned over to the defense. In most situations, if the offense reaches their fourth down they will [[Punt (American football)|punt]] the ball to the other team, which forces them to begin their drive from further down the field; if they are in [[field goal range]], they might also attempt to score a field goal.<ref name="Beginner's Guide to Football" /> A group of officials, the chain crew, keeps track of both the downs and the distance measurements.<ref name="The Orchestration of the Chain Gang">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/01/sports/football/01chainside.html?_r=0|title=The Orchestration of the Chain Gang|last=Branch|first=John|date=December 31, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref> On television, a yellow line is electronically superimposed on the field to show the first down line to the viewing audience.<ref name="Yellow line">{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/outdoors/sports/4301993|title=The Tech Behind the Football's Broadcast-Only First Down Line: The Tech Behind the Football's Broadcast-Only First Down Line|last=St. John|first=Allan|date=December 18, 2009|publisher=[[Popular Mechanics]]|accessdate=2 November 2012}}</ref>

===Kicking===

There are two categories of kicks in football: scrimmage kicks, which can be executed by the offensive team on any down from behind or on the line of scrimmage,<ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. 50">NFL Rules 2012, p. 50.</ref><ref name="NCAA Rules 2011-2012, p. 34">NCAA Rules 2011<U+2013>2012, p. 34.</ref><ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, p. 32">NFHS Rules 2012, p. 32.</ref> and free kicks.<ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. 6">NFL Rules 2012, p. 6.</ref><ref name="NCAA Rules 2011-2012, p. 30">NCAA Rules 2011<U+2013>2012, p. 30.</ref><ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, p. 27">NFHS Rules 2012, p. 27.</ref> The free kicks are the [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]], which starts the first and third quarters and overtime and follows a try attempt or a successful field goal, and the [[Safety kick#Resuming play after a safety|safety kick]], which follows a safety.<ref name="NCAA Rules 2011-2012, p. 34">NCAA Rules 2011<U+2013>2012, p. 34.</ref><ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. 8-9">NFL Rules 2012, p.&nbsp;8<U+2013>9.</ref><ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, p. 31-32">NFHS Rules 2012, p.&nbsp;31<U+2013>32.</ref>

On a kickoff, the ball is placed at the 35-yard line of the kicking team in professional and college play and at the 40-yard line in high school play. The ball may be drop-kicked or place-kicked. If a place kick is chosen, the ball can be placed on the ground or on a tee, and a holder may be used in either case. On a safety kick, the kicking team kicks the ball from their own 20-yard line. They can punt, drop-kick or place-kick the ball, but a tee may not be used in professional play. Any member of the receiving team may catch or advance the ball, and the ball may be recovered by the kicking team once it has gone at least ten yards or has been touched by any member of the receiving team.<ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. 29-30">NFL Rules 2012, p.&nbsp;29<U+2013>30.</ref><ref name="NCAA Rules 2011-2012, p. 61-64">NCAA Rules 2011<U+2013>2012, p.&nbsp;61<U+2013>64.</ref><ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, p. 15, 46, 52-53">NFHS Rules 2012, p. 15, 46, 52-53.</ref>

The three types of scrimmage kicks are place kicks, drop kicks, and punts.

Officials are responsible for enforcing game rules and monitoring the clock. All officials carry a [[whistle]] and wear black-and-white striped shirts and black hats except for the referee, whose hat is white. Each carries a [[Penalty flag|weighted yellow flag]] that is thrown to the ground to signal that a [[Penalty (gridiron football)|foul]] has been called.

*The '''referee''' is charged with oversight and control of the game and is the authority on the score, the down number, and any and all rule interpretations in discussions between the other officials. He announces all penalties and discusses the infraction with the offending team's captain, monitors for illegal hits against the quarterback, makes requests for first-down measurements, and notifies the head coach whenever a player is ejected.
*The '''umpire''', who is positioned in the backfield, watches play along the line of scrimmage to make sure that no more than 11 offensive players are on the field prior to the snap and that no offensive linemen are [[Ineligible receiver downfield|illegally downfield]] on pass plays. He monitors the contact between offensive and defensive linemen and calls most of the [[Holding (American football)|holding]] penalties. The umpire records the number of timeouts taken and the winner of the coin toss and the game score, assists the referee in situations involving possession of the ball close to the line of scrimmage, determines whether player equipment is legal, and dries wet balls prior to the snap if a game is played in rain.
*The '''head linesman''' lines up opposite the line judge. He watches for any line-of-scrimmage and illegal use-of-hands violations and assists the line judge with illegal shift or illegal motion calls. The head linesman also rules on out-of-bounds calls that happen on his side of the field, oversees the chain crew and marks the forward progress of a runner when a play has been whistled dead.

[[File:First down marker.png|thumb|upright|A modern down indicator box is mounted on a pole and is used to mark the current line of scrimmage. The number on the marker is changed using a dial.]]
*The '''line judge''' supervises player substitutions, the line of scrimmage during punts, and game timing. He notifies the referee when time has expired at the end of a quarter and notifies the head coach of the home team when five minutes remain for halftime. In the NFL, the line judge also alerts the referee when [[Two-minute warning|two minutes remain in the half]]. If the clock malfunctions or becomes inoperable, the line judge becomes the official timekeeper.
*The '''back judge''' ensures that the defensive team has no more than 11 players on the field and determines whether catches are legal, whether field goal or extra point attempts are good, and whether a [[pass interference]] violation occurred.
*The '''side judge''' mainly duplicates the functions of the back judge but is positioned twenty yards downfield from the line of scrimmage and opposite to the back judge.
*The '''field judge''' monitors and controls the [[play clock]], counts the number of defensive players on the field, and watches for offensive pass interference and illegal use-of-hands violations by offensive players. He also makes decisions regarding catches, recoveries, the ball spot when a player goes out of bounds, and illegal touching of fumbled balls that have crossed the line of scrimmage.
Another set of officials, the [[chain crew]], are responsible for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10 yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down. The chain crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure. A typical chain crew will have at least three people - two members of the chain crew will hold either of the two sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down, and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.<ref name="The Orchestration of the Chain Gang ">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/01/sports/football/01chainside.html?_r=0|title=The Orchestration of the Chain Gang |last=Branch|first=John|date=December 31, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}</ref>

===Minor professional leagues===
Several football leagues have been formed as rival leagues to the NFL. The [[XFL]] was created in 2001 by [[Vince McMahon]] and lasted for only one season. Despite television contracts with NBC and [[UPN]] and high expectations, the XFL suffered from poor television ratings and a low quality of play.<ref name="No More Springtimes for the XFL as League Folds">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/11/sports/pro-football-no-more-springtimes-for-the-xfl-as-league-folds.html|title=No More Springtimes for the XFL as League Folds|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|date=May 11, 2001|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}</ref> The [[United Football League (2009<U+2013>)|United Football League]] (UFL) has suspended its [[2012 UFL season|2012]] season, its fourth, due to financial issues.<ref name="Just What Is Going on with the UFL?">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/sportsnet/just-what-going-ufl-850157|title=Just What Is Going on with the UFL?|last=Keiser|first=Thomas|date=October 20, 2012|work=[[International Business Times]]|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}</ref> The [[United States Football League]] (USFL) operated for three seasons from 1983 to 1985 but collapsed due to poor business decisions and monetary problems.

The most successful minor league was the American Football League (AFL), which existed from 1960 to 1969. The AFL operated as a minor league from [[1960 American Football League season|1960]] to [[1964 American Football League season|1964]] and then signed a five-year, [[United States Dollar|USD]] $36 million television deal with NBC and competed directly against the NFL. AFL teams signed NFL players to contracts, and their popularity grew to challenge that of the NFL. The two leagues merged in the [[1970 NFL season|1970 season]], and all AFL teams joined the NFL. An earlier minor league, the [[All-America Football Conference]], was in play from 1946 to 1949. Two AAFC teams, the [[Cleveland Browns]] and the [[San Francisco 49ers]], became members of the NFL.<ref name="Off-the-field competition yields game-changing merger">{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/01/22/afl_history_2/|title=Off-the-field competition yields game-changing merger|last=Cross|first=B.

Large team sizes are an additional difficulty, due to the Olympics' set limit of 10,500 athletes and coaches. These issues are similar to those that rugby union faced prior to being admitted into the Olympics in the form of [[rugby sevens]], a modified version of the sport, but football also has the issue of global visibility. [[Nigel Melville]], the CEO of [[USA Rugby]], noted that while rugby union has a major international presence through the [[International Rugby Board]], "American football is recognized globally as a sport, but it's not played globally". In order to solve these concerns, major effort has been put into promoting [[flag football]], a modified version of American football, at the international level.<ref name="Football in Olympics is a dream that could become a reality" />

[[Canadian football]], the predominant form of football in Canada, is closely related to American football - both sports developed from rugby, and the two sports are considered to be the chief variants of [[gridiron football]]. Although Canadian football developed independently from American football, the two games share a [[Comparison of American and Canadian football|similar set of rules]], but there are several key rule differences: in the Canadian game, the field measures 150 yards (137 m) by 65 (59 m) yards and has 20-yard end zones, teams have three downs instead of four, there are twelve players on each side instead of eleven, fair catches are not allowed, and a [[Single (football)|single point]] is scored if the offensive team kicks the ball out of the defense's end zone.<ref name="Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212839/gridiron-football|title=Gridiron football|pages=1, 13<U+2013>14|publisher=[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online]]|accessdate=January 10, 2013}}</ref> The [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) is the major Canadian league and is the second-most popular sporting league in Canada, behind only the [[National Hockey League]].<ref name="Head to Head: CFL vs. NFL">{{cite web|url=http://www.carillonregina.com/?p=2097|title=Head to Head: CFL vs. NFL|last1=Buchinski|first1=Colin|last2=Neu|first2=Dietrich|date=January 6, 2011|work=[[The Carillon]]|accessdate=January 10, 2013}}</ref>

Below the Arena Football League are what ''[[New York Times]]'' writer Mike Tanier described as the "most minor of minor leagues:" [[Indoor American football|indoor football]] leagues. Like in arena football, teams in indoor football leagues play in arenas, but games are only attended by a small number of fans, and most players are [[semi-professional]] athletes. Indoor football leagues are unstable, with franchises regularly moving from one league to another or merging with other teams, and teams or entire leagues dissolving entirely. The [[Indoor Football League]], [[Southern Indoor Football League]], [[Ultimate Indoor Football League]], [[Continental Indoor Football League]] and [[American Professional Football League]] are examples of prominent indoor leagues.<ref name="Staying in the Game on Football's Fringe">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/28/sports/football/staying-in-the-game-on-footballs-fringe.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|title=Staying in the Game on Football's Fringe|last=Tainer|first=Mike|date=June 27, 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>
