'''Mariah Carey''' (born March 27, 1970) is an [[United States|American]] [[Pop music|pop]]/[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[singer-songwriter]], [[record producer]] and actress.  She made her recording debut, in 1990, under the guidance of [[Columbia Records]] executive [[Tommy Mottola]], and became the first recording artist to have her first five singles top the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. Following her marriage to Mottola, in 1993, a series of hit records established her position as Columbia Records' highest-selling act.

Following her separation from Mottola, in 1997, she introduced elements of [[hip hop music|hip hop]] into her album work, to much initial success, but her popularity was in decline when she left Columbia, in 2001. She signed a record $80 million dollar deal with [[Virgin Records]], only to be dropped from the label and bought out of her contract in the following year. This radical turn of events was due to the highly publicized physical and emotional breakdown, as well as the poor reception that was given to ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'', her film and soundtrack project. In 2002, Carey signed with [[Island Records]], and, after a relatively unsuccessful period, she returned to the top of pop music, in 2005, with her album, ''[[The Emancipation of Mimi]]''.<ref>Lamb, Bill.

Carey spent much of her time at home, alone, and turned to music to occupy herself. She began to sing at around the age of three, when her mother began to teach her, after Carey imitated her mother practicing [[Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Rigoletto]]'' in Italian.<ref>Shapiro, pg. 18<U+2013>19.</ref>

Carey graduated from [[Harborfields High School]], in [[Greenlawn, New York]]. She was frequently absent, because of her work as a [[demo (music)|demo]] singer for local recording studios; her classmates consequently gave her the nickname "[[Mirage]]".<ref>Shapiro, pg. 31.</ref> Her work in the Long Island music scene provided opportunities to work with musicians, such as [[Gavin Christopher]] and [[Ben Margulies]], with whom she co-wrote material for her demo tape. After she moved to New York City, she worked part-time jobs to pay the rent and she completed 500 hours of beauty school.<ref>Handelman, David. "Miss Mariah." ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''. December 1997.</ref> Eventually, she became a backup singer for [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[freestyle music|freestyle]] singer [[Brenda K. Starr]].

=== 1988<U+2013>1992: Early career ===
In 1988, Carey met Columbia Records executive [[Tommy Mottola]] at a party, where Starr gave Carey's demo tape to him. Mottola played the tape when he left the party and was impressed. He returned to find Carey but she had left. Nevertheless, Mottola tracked her down and signed her to a recording contract. This [[Cinderella]]-like story became part of the standard publicity that surrounded Carey's entrance into the industry.<ref name="Vibe-Apr1996">Gardner, Elysa. "Cinderella Story." ''[[Vibe (magazine)|VIBE]]''. April 1996.</ref>

Carey co-wrote the tracks on her 1990 debut album ''[[Mariah Carey (album)|Mariah Carey]]'' and she has co-written most of her material since. During the recording, she expressed dissatisfaction with the contributions of producers such as [[Ric Wake]] and [[Rhett Lawrence]], whom the executives at Columbia had enlisted to help to make the album more commercially viable.<ref>Shapiro, pg. 47, 60.</ref> Critics were generally enthusiastic (See [[Mariah Carey (album)#Critical reception|Critical reception section of the album article]]). Backed by a substantial promotional budget, the album reached number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, where it remained for several weeks. It yielded four number-one singles and made Carey a star in the United States but it was less successful in other countries. Critics rated the album highly, which assisted Carey's [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] wins for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]], and<U+2014>for her debut single, "[[Vision of Love]]"<ref>{{cite web

Carey conceived ''[[Emotions (album)|Emotions]]'', her second album, as an homage to [[Motown Records|Motown]] [[soul music]] (see [[Motown Records#The Motown Sound|Motown Sound]]), and she worked with [[Walter Afanasieff]] and [[Robert Clivill<U+00E9>s|Clivill<U+00E9>s]] & [[David Cole (producer)|Cole]] (from the [[dance music|dance]] group [[C+C Music Factory]]) on the record. It was released soon after her debut album <U+2014> in late 1991 <U+2014> but was neither as critically or commercially successful (See [[Emotions (album)#Promotion and reception|Promotion and reception section of the album article]]). The title track "[[Emotions (song)|Emotions]]" made Carey into the only recording act whose first five singles have reached number one on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart, although the album's follow-up singles failed to match this feat. Carey had lobbied to produce her own songs and, beginning with ''Emotions'', she has co-produced most of her material. "I didn't want [''Emotions''] to be somebody else's vision of me," she said. "There's more of me on this album."<ref>Shapiro, pg. 62.</ref>

Although Carey performed live occasionally, stage fright prevented her from embarking on a major tour.<ref>Kaufman, Gil. [http://www.vh1.com/news/editorial/?page=1&contentId=1583255 "20 Things [that&#93; You Didn't Know About Mariah Carey"]. ''[[VH1]]''. March 12, 2008.

The duet was released as a single, reached number one in the U.S. and led to a record deal for Lorenz,<ref name="Allmusic"/> whose debut album Carey later co-produced.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trey Lorenz > Credits

===1993<U+2013>96: First marriage, and international success ===

[[Kenneth Edmonds|Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds]] consulted on the album ''[[Music Box (album)|Music Box]]'', which was released later that year and became Carey's most successful worldwide.

She scored a couple of huge hits, "Hero" and "Dreamlover", where she did inject some personality and intensity into the leads.

"Hero," with its message of self-sufficiency, aims for the inspirational grandeur of "Greatest Love of All", while "Just to Hold You Once Again" and "All I've Ever Wanted" chase the tail of "I Will Always Love You."

In 1995, Columbia released Carey's fourth studio album, ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'', which combined the pop sensibilities of ''Music Box'' with downbeat R&B and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] influences. A remix of "[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]", its first single, featured rapper [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]. Carey said that Columbia reacted negatively to her intentions for the album: "Everybody was like 'What, are you crazy?'. They're very nervous about breaking the formula."<ref>Shapiro, pg. 92.</ref> The New Yorker noted that "It became standard for R&B stars, like Missy Eliott and Beyonc<U+00E9>, to combine melodies with rapped verses." John Norris of MTV News has stated that the remix was "responsible for, I would argue, an entire wave of music that we've seen since and that is the R&B-hip-hop collaboration. You could argue that the 'Fantasy' remix was the single most important recording that she's ever made." Norris echoed the sentiments of TLC's Lisa Lopes, who told MTV that it's because of Mariah that we have "R&B." ''Daydream'' became her biggest-selling album in the U.S. and its singles achieved similar success <U+2014> "Fantasy" became the second single to debut at number one in the U.S. and topped the [[Canadian Singles Chart]] for twelve weeks; "[[One Sweet Day]]" (a duet with [[Boyz II Men]]) spent a record-holding sixteen weeks at number one in the U.S.; and "[[Always Be My Baby]]" (co-produced by [[Jermaine Dupri]]) was the most successful record on U.S. radio in 1996, according to ''Billboard'' magazine. The album also generated career-best reviews for Carey,<ref>Shapiro, pg. 94<U+2013>96.</ref> and publications such as ''The New York Times'' named it as one of 1995's best albums; the ''Times'' wrote that its "best cuts bring R&B candy-making to a new peak of textural refinement [...] Carey's songwriting has taken a leap forward and become more relaxed, sexier and less reliant on thudding clich<U+00E9>s."<ref>Holden, Stephen. "Mariah Carey Glides Into New Territory." ''The New York Times''. pg. 76, October 13, 1995.</ref> and ''AllMusic'' adds, "Daydream is her best record to date, and features a consistently strong selection of songs and a remarkably impassioned performance by Carey. A few of the songs are second-rate <U+2014> particularly the cover of Journey's "Open Arms" <U+2014> but Daydream demonstrates that Carey continues to perfect her craft and that she has earned her status as an R&B diva."<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r224030|pure_url=yes}} |title=((( Daydream > Overview ))) |publisher=allmusic |date=1995-10-03 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref> The short but profitable [[Daydream World Tour]] augmented sales of the album.

===1997<U+2013>2000: New image, ''Butterfly'' and ''Rainbow'' ===
Carey and Mottola officially separated in 1997. Although the public image of the marriage was a happy one, she said that, in reality, she had felt trapped by her relationship with Mottola, whom she often described as controlling.<ref>Shapiro, pg. 97<U+2013>98.</ref> They officially announced their separation in 1997 and their divorce became final in the following year. Soon after the separation, Carey hired an independent publicist and a new attorney and manager.

==Artistry==
Carey has said that from childhood she has been influenced by R&B and soul musicians such as [[Billie Holiday]], [[Sarah Vaughan]],<ref name="Norent, Lynn 1991">Norent, Lynn.

I grew up with this music".<ref>Shapiro, pg. 124.</ref> She has expressed appreciation for rappers such as [[The Sugarhill Gang]], [[Eric B. & Rakim]], the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] and [[Mobb Deep]],<ref name="Vibe-Apr1996"/> with whom she collaborated on the single "[[The Roof (Back in Time)]]" (1998).

During Carey's career, her vocal and musical style, along with her level of success, has been compared to [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Celine Dion]]. Carey and her peers, according to Garry Mulholland, are "the princesses of wails [...] virtuoso vocalists who blend chart-oriented pop with mature [[middle of the road (music)|MOR]] [[torch song]]".<ref>Mulholland, Garry. ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music'' (2003). pg. 57. UK: Flame Tree Publishing. ISBN 1-904041-70-1.</ref> In ''She Bop II: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop and Soul'' (2002), writer Lucy O'Brien attributed the comeback of [[Barbra Streisand]]'s "old-fashioned showgirl" to Carey and Dion, and described them and Houston as "groomed, airbrushed and overblown to perfection".<ref name="SheBopII">O'Brien, Lucy.

UK: Guinness Publishing Ltd. ISBN 0-85112-072-5.</ref> Despite the fact that Carey is often credited with co-writing her material, she has also been accused of plagiarism on several occasions. Many of these cases were eventually settled out of court.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,28109,00.html |title=Mariah Carey's 'Hero': The Envelope Please |author=Roger Friedman |work=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] | date=June 26, 2001}}June 26, 2001.

In an interview with the singer, Ron Givens of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' described it this way, "[f]irst, a rippling, soulful ''ooh'' comes rolling effortlessly from her throat: alto.

[[Love]] is the subject of the majority of Carey's lyrics, although she has written about themes such as [[racism]], [[social alienation]], [[death]], [[world hunger]], and [[spirituality]]. She has said that much of her work is partly autobiographical, but ''TIME'' magazine wrote: "If only Mariah Carey's music had the drama of her life.
