'''Route 52''' is a [[state highway]] in the southern part of the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]]. The highway runs {{convert|2.74|mi|km|2|abbr=on}} from Palen Avenue in  [[Ocean City, New Jersey|Ocean City]], [[Cape May County, New Jersey|Cape May County]] north  to [[U.S. Route 9 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 9]] (New Road) in [[Somers Point, New Jersey|Somers Point]], [[Atlantic County, New Jersey|Atlantic County]]. It is composed mostly of a series of four-lane undivided bridges over [[Great Egg Harbor River|Great Egg Harbor]] from Ocean City to Somers Point known as the '''Howard S. Stainton Memorial Causeway'''. The remainder of the route is a four-lane undivided surface road called MacArthur Boulevard that runs from the causeway to U.S. Route 9. This section of the route includes the [[Somers Point Circle]], where Route 52 intersects [[County Route 559 (New Jersey)|County Route 559]] and [[County Route 585 (New Jersey)|County Route 585]].

Route 52 was originally designated in 1951 to run the Somers Point Circle northwest to [[Mays Landing, New Jersey|Mays Landing]]. This routing never came about and in 1953, Route 52 was designated onto its current alignment. County Route 585 ran concurrent with the route south of the Somers Point Circle until 1971, when it was truncated to end at the Somers Point Circle. In 2006, construction began on the replacement of the Route 52 causeway that was built in the 1930s over the Great Egg Harbor, beginning with guardrail repairs that reduced traffic to two lanes. In 2008, the northbound lanes of the causeway were opened to traffic. Construction is underway on the southbound lanes, which are expected to be completed in later 2009. The entire project is planned to be completed by 2012, including other improvements such as the construction of fishing piers, boat ramps, bike paths, walking trails, gateways, and a new Ocean City Visitor Center. In addition, improvements will be made to MacArthur Boulevard that include the addition of a center left-turn lane and the replacement of the Somers Point Circle with a traffic light. This project is to receive $70 million from the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|stimulus bill]] signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] in 2009.

Stainton Memorial Causeway, which crosses over Great Egg Harbor on a [[drawbridge]] and then the longer Rainbow Harbor Channel. In between these two channels is an island where the Ocean City Visitor Center is located. After crossing the Rainbow Harbor Channel, the road runs along another island before crossing over the Great Egg Harbor Thoroughfare (part of the [[Intracoastal Waterway]]) and then a ship channel on another drawbridge, where the route enters [[Somers Point, New Jersey|Somers Point]] in [[Atlantic County, New Jersey|Atlantic County]].<ref name="sld"/><ref name="google"/> After the ship canal, Route 52 crosses onto the mainland and intersects with [[County Route 559 (New Jersey)|County Route 559]] (Somers Point Road) and [[County Route 585 (New Jersey)|County Route 585]] (Shore Road) at the [[Somers Point Circle]].<ref name="sld"/>  Past the Somers Point Circle, Route 52 becomes a two-lane, {{convert|40|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} road known as MacArthur Boulevard that heads north through commercial areas before entering residential areas.<ref name="google"/> Route 52 comes to an end at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 9 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 9]] (New Road), where the road continues northwest as West Laurel Drive, which heads through a residential neighborhood to an interchange with the [[Garden State Parkway]].<ref name="sld"/><ref name="google"/>

== History ==
The causeway between Ocean City and Somers Point was built in the 1930s with four lanes and no shoulders.<ref name=Inquirer>{{cite news |first=Jacqueline L. |last=Urgo | |title=Bottleneck at Shore will be a breeze|publisher=''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] '' |date=February 10, 2008}}</ref> Route 52 was designated 1951 to run from the Somers Point Circle northwest to [[New Jersey Route 48|Route 48]] (now [[U.S. Route 40 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 40]]) and [[New Jersey Route 50|Route 50]] in [[Mays Landing, New Jersey|Mays Landing]]. However, Route 52 was never built to run to Mays Landing. Two years later, in the [[1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering]], Route 52 was designated to run from the Ocean City side of the Great Egg Harbor causeway north to U.S. Route 9 in Somers Point.<ref name=alpsroads/> With the creation of the [[500-series county route (New Jersey)|500-series county routes]] in New Jersey in 1952, County Route 585 was designated to run along Route 52 between the southern terminus and the Somers Point Circle as part of its route between [[New Jersey Route 109|Route 109]] in [[Lower Township, New Jersey|Lower Township]] and [[U.S. Route 30 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 30]] and [[New Jersey Route 157|Route 157]] in [[Absecon, New Jersey|Absecon]].<ref name=alpsroads2>{{Cite web|author=Alpert, Steve|title=New Jersey Roads <U+2013> NJ State Highways <U+2013> CR 561-585|year=|publisher=Alps<U+2019> Roads|accessdate=2009-03-09|url=http://www.alpsroads.net/roads/nj/log/55.html#585}}</ref><ref name="chevron">{{cite map|publisher=[[Chevron Oil Company]]|title= Map of New Jersey |year=1969|cartography=[[H.M.

== Future ==
Construction is underway for a new $400 million [[causeway]] to replace the 1930s bridges over the Great Egg Harbor. The causeway is in need of replacement due to deteriorating conditions of the bridges, increasing automobile and marine traffic on the Great Egg Harbor, flooding from storms, and a high accident rate due to narrow lanes and a lack of shoulders.<ref name=njdot>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/commuter/roads/route52/faqs.shtm |title=Route 52 Causeway Bridge Replacement, Frequently Asked Questions, Construction Updates, Commuter Information|publisher=[[New Jersey Department of Transportation]]||accessdate=2009-03-09}}</ref>  On January 16, 2006, the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] reduced traffic on the existing bridges from four lanes to two lanes to limit the weight on the old structures. The highway was reopened to four lanes of traffic after guardrail repairs were made on May 17, 2006, with a new speed limit of {{convert|35|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/about/press/2006/051706.shtm|title= NJDOT doubles capacity of Route 52 Causeway|publisher=[[New Jersey Department of Transportation]]|date=May 17, 2006|accessdate=2009-03-09}}</ref> After years of delays, construction began on the new bridge in September 2006. Crews began the project by clearing a staging area on Garrets Island near the Ocean City side.<ref name=pressac>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Miller | |title=Five-year job to cost $400 million |publisher=''[[Press of Atlantic City]]'' |date=September 26, 2006}}</ref> The new bridge will be finished by 2012, with the northbound bridge completed in April 2008, the southbound bridge completed by later 2009, and the remainder of the project, which includes the removal of the two drawbridges, expected to be complete between June 2009 and December 2012.<ref name = Inquirer/><ref name=njdot2>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/about/press/2008/091208.shtm|title=NJDOT announces Route 52 Causeway southbound lane closure |publisher=[[New Jersey Department of Transportation]]|date=September 12, 2008|accessdate=2009-03-09}}</ref>  The southbound direction is currently reduced to one lane until May 2009 to allow for construction on the replacement of the causeway to continue.<ref name=njdot2/> 

In addition to the new causeway, the project will also call for the construction of fishing piers, boat ramps, bike paths, walking trails, and gateways at each end of the causeway, including a new visitor center with a scenic overlook on the Ocean City side.<ref name=Inquirer/> Also, other improvements will be made to the MacArthur Boulevard portion of Route 52 including the addition of a center left-turn lane and the replacement of the Somers Point Circle with a traffic light.<ref name=Inquirer/><ref name=njdot/> As a result of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|stimulus bill]] signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] on February 17, 2009, $70 million, or about 8 percent of the money allocated to New Jersey in the bill, is going to construction of the second half of the Route 52 causeway project.<ref name=pressac2>{{cite web |last=Miller |first=Michael |title=Slow economy may drop Route 52 causeway cost |publisher=''[[Press of Atlantic City]]'' |date=March 7, 2009 |url=http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/181/story/421862.html|accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref>
