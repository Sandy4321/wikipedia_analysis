The '''Museum of Scotland''', [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], is a building which, together with the adjacent [[Royal Museum]], comprises the [[National Museum of Scotland]].  It is dedicated to the [[History of Scotland|history]], [[Scottish people|people]] and [[culture of Scotland]]. The museum is on [[Chambers Street (Edinburgh)|Chambers Street]], in central Edinburgh. It is part of the [[National Museums of Scotland]]. Admission is free.

Opened in 1998, incorporating collections from the '''National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland''' and Scottish items from the Royal Museum, the museum possesses a distinctive look. 

==Collections==
Notable artefacts include:

* Sculptures by Sir [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], housing prehistoric [[jewellery]]
* The [[Monymusk Reliquary]]
* 10 of the [[Lewis chessmen]].  (The rest are owned by the [[British Museum]])
* A [[Union Flag]] and [[flag of Scotland|Scottish Flag]] raised by the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverians]] and [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] respectively at the [[Battle of Culloden]]
* Paintings by [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]]
* Sculptures by [[Andy Goldsworthy]], inspired by the work of Scottish geologist [[James Hutton]]

==Architecture==

The building's [[architecture]] was controversial from the start, and [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] resigned as patron of the museum, in protest at the lack of consultation over its design. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/13/newsid_2529000/2529117.stm] Initially conceived as an extension to the adjacent Victorian museum, it eventually came to be a museum in its own right, although the two are linked internally.

The museum is made up of geometric, [[Le Corbusier|Corbusian]] forms, but also has numerous references to Scotland, such as [[broch]]s and [[castle|castellated]], defensive, architecture.  It is clad in golden [[Moray]] [[sandstone]], which one of its architects, Gordon Benson, has called "the oldest exhibit in the building", a reference to [[Geology of Scotland|Scottish geology]].  The building was a 1999 [[Stirling Prize]] nominee.
