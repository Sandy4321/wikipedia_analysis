'''Catholic resistance to Nazism''' (1920s<U+2013>1945) refers to forms of opposition originating from within the [[Roman Catholic Church]], including resistance to the anti-Church policies of the Third Reich, and its infractions of Church doctrine, as well as to broader actions and policies of the Nazis throughout the [[Nazi Empire]]. It was undertaken by individuals and groups from all levels of Catholic hierarchy: from the papacy, to the [[Catholic religious order|religious orders]], to parish clergy, religious, and lay people. Ideologically, the Catholic Church rejected the pseudo-science of [[Nazi eugenics]] and [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial]] and nationalist idolatry which underpinned [[Nazi ideology]], and preached instead of the "unity of the human race". Organisationally, the Church offered networks and institutions within which people could gather, distance themselves from the regime, provide aid to Nazi victims, and find a platform from which to oppose Nazi policies. In certain occupied regions, Catholic resistance was "armed", elsewhere it was sometimes largely limited to defence of Church rights. The extent to which Catholics actively resisted varied considerably between regions, and over time. Historian [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]] has called 'the idea that the Catholic Church almost universally opposed Nazism, 'as questionable as the contrary thesis of a Communist mass movement against Hitler', and attributed the 1933 paralysis of Germany's [[Catholic Centre Party]] to what he perceived as Catholicism's "flirtation" with the new regime at that time.<ref name="BracherThe">Bracher, The German Dictatorship, p.461,462</ref> Historian Derek Hastings has written about a Catholic affinity for Nazism, which first grew and developed in Catholic Munich,  before the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] of 1923, and which was reasserted in 1933.<ref>Robert P.Ericksen, Complicity in the Holocaust, p.49</ref>

In the lead up to the 1933 Nazi takeover, [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|German Catholic]] leaders were outspoken in their criticism of Nazism. This changed in the first months of 1933 as all bans against Nazi membership were withdrawn and Catholics allowed enthusiasm for Nazi 'values' to emerge.  Hitler's focus on discipline, orderliness, anti-communism, and German national pride was not uncongenial to 'milieu Catholicism'.  Crucially, the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] was effected with the aid of the Catholic Centre Party - 'In this way, the transition in Adolf Hitler's reign from democratic to dictatorial power came at the hands of German Catholics'.<ref>Erickesen, Compliicity in the Holocaust, p.48, 52</ref> Following the Nazi takeover, the Catholic Church sought an [[Reich concordat|accord]] with the Government, was [[Gleichschaltung|pressured to conform]], and faced [[kirchenkampf|persecution]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} While head of the Bishop's Conference [[Adolf Bertram]] persisted in a policy of avoiding confrontation, the activities of certain Bishops such as [[Konrad von Preysing]], [[Joseph Frings]] and [[August von Galen]] came to form a coherent, systematic critique of many of the teachings of Nazism.<ref name="Theodore S. Hamerow p. 133" /> The churches in Germany did not advocate for the overthrow of the regime, but they provided the earliest and most enduring centres of systematic opposition to Nazi policies,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} and Christian morality and the anti-Church policies of the Nazis motivated many in the [[German Resistance]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The Catholic critique of Nazism was most prominently expressed in the 1937 encyclical of [[Pope Pius XI]]: ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' ("With Burning Anxiety"), which condemned Nazi racial theory and accused the regime of systematic hostility to the Church. An estimated one third of German priests faced some form of reprisal from the authorities. At [[Dachau Concentration Camp]] in 1940, the Nazis established a dedicated [[Priest Barracks of Dachau|Clergy Barracks]] for clerical dissidents from across the expanding Nazi Empire. Some 2,579 <U+2013> or 95% of inmates <U+2013> were Catholic. Pastoral letters and sermons defending human rights were issued by the German bishops and encyclicals from [[Pope Pius XII]] - such as ''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'' (1939) and ''[[Mystici Corporis Christi]]'' (1943) - continued a papal critique of Nazi Totalitarianism. Pius XII pursued a policy of impartiality in the [[Second World War]], maintained [[Pius XII and the German Resistance|links to the German Resistance]] and directed his church to provide aid to the persecuted. The generality and caution of his public statements has left a [[Canonization of Pope Pius XII|contested legacy]]. By lobbying officials, providing false documents, and hiding people in monasteries, convents, schools, among families and at the Vatican itself, the [[Rescue of Jews by Catholics during the Holocaust|Catholic Church saved many thousands of Jews]] from the [[Nazi Holocaust]]. Historian of the Holocaust [[Martin Gilbert]] wrote that, in every country under German occupation, priests played a major part in rescuing Jews. Historian [[Michael Phayer]] wrote that "''Rescuers and perpetrators were but a slight minority of Europe's Catholic population''."<ref name="Phayer">Phayer, 2000, p. xiii</ref>

In Germany, the Church opposed the regime's closure of Catholic schools, organisations and publications and restrictions on religious observance. Various churchmen spoke of moral dangers to Germany from the regime's violations of basic human rights. A number of Catholic priests were influential in the German Resistance <U+2013> among them [[Alfred Delp]], [[Augustin R<U+00F6>sch]] and [[Laurentius Siemer]]. Catholic notions of [[natural law]] heavily influenced the outlook of the Resistance<ref>Graml, Mommsen, Reichhardt & Wolf; The German Resistance to Hitler; B. T. Batsford Ltd; London; 1970; p.&nbsp;100<U+2013>101</ref> and religious motives inspired the actions of lay leaders of the movement, including the [[July Plot]]ers [[Jakob Kaiser]], [[Bernhard Letterhaus]] and [[Klaus von Stauffenberg]]; and [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]] activists [[Gertrud Luckner]] and [[Margarete Sommer]]. [[Catholic Action]] leader [[Erich Klausener]]; Catholic Youth leader [[Adalbert Probst]]; [[German Catholics<U+2019> Peace Association]] founder Fr [[Max Josef Metzger]]; and [[Provost (religion)|Provost]] [[Bernhard Lichtenberg]] were among the Catholic leaders martyred in Germany for challenging the regime. Historian of the [[German Resistance]], [[Anton Gill]] wrote that ordinary Catholics<ref>German Catholics had generally not voted Nazi ([[Mary Fulbrook]]; ''The Fontana History of Germany: 1918<U+2013>1990 The Divided Nation''; Fontana Press; 1991; p.55.) and "detestation of Nazism was overwhelming within the Catholic Church" ([[Ian Kershaw]]; ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation''; 4th Edn; Oxford University Press; New York; 2000; p.&nbsp;211<U+2013>12)</ref> in Germany demonstrated their disapproval of the regime by attending huge gatherings. Klausener spoke against political oppression to 60,000 gathered after Mass at the 1934 rally prior to his assassination.<ref name="Honourable Defeat p.59" /> Amid the Nazi crackdown that followed ''Mit brennender Sorge'', 800,000 attended the [[Aachen]] pilgrimage of 1937 and 60,000 attended the 700th anniversary of the bishopric of Franconia.<ref name="Honourable Defeat p.58" /> [[Ian Kershaw]] wrote that the churches "engaged in a bitter war of attrition with the regime, receiving the demonstrative backing of millions of churchgoers. Applause for Church leaders whenever they appeared in public, swollen attendances at events such as Corpus Christi Day processions, and packed church services were outward signs of the struggle of&nbsp;... especially of the Catholic Church - against Nazi oppression". While the Church ultimately failed to protect its youth organisations and schools, it did have some successes in mobilizing public opinion to alter government policies.<ref name="Ian Kershaw pp210-11"/> Nevertheless, many ordinary German Catholics offered at least passive acquiescence in, if not active support for, the Nazi dictatorship.<ref name="MaryFulbrook">Mary Fulbrook; The Fontana History of Germany: 1918<U+2013>1990 The Divided Nation; Fontana Press; 1991; pp.&nbsp;80<U+2013>81</ref>

Thousands of dissidents of all hierarchical ranks were sent to the concentration camps from around the [[Nazi Empire]] - among them saints [[Edith Stein]] and [[Maximillian Kolbe]], who died at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}. Groups like [[Hugh O'Flaherty]]'s "Rome Escape Line", the [[Assisi Network]] and Poland's ''[[Zegota]]'' protected Jews and others through Catholic networks. Catholic bishops such as the Netherlands' [[Johannes de Jong]], Belgium's [[Jozef-Ernest van Roey]] and France's [[Jules-G<U+00E9>raud Sali<U+00E8>ge]] issued major denunciations. Papal diplomats such as [[Angelo Roncalli]], [[Andrea Cassulo]], [[Filippo Bernardini]] and [[Angelo Rotta]] engaged in vigorous diplomatic lobbying and clandestine activities to protect victims of the Nazis. Convents across Europe played a significant role under the leadership of nuns like [[Margit Slachta]] and [[Matylda Getter]]. During the war, in certain regions, Catholic lay resistance was "armed", with partisans like the Italian ''[[Brigate Fiamme Verdi|Fiamme Verdi]]'' and "partisan chaplains" fighting guerrilla campaigns against the Nazis and their allies. In the [[Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles|Polish Holocaust]], the Catholic majority [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|faced a severe Nazi persecution]], with clergy targeted for extermination. The [[Polish Home Army]] was conscious of the link between morale and religious practice and the Catholic religion was integral to much Polish resistance.<ref name="Norman Davies p.402">Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Vikiing; 2003; p.402</ref> Resistance among the clergy was not universal. In the small Nazi puppet states of Slovakia and Croatia in particular, prominent churchmen collaborated with the Fascists, sparking a rift with the Vatican.

The Nazis disliked universities, intellectuals and the Catholic and Protestant churches.

Aggressive anti-Church radicals like [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Martin Bormann]] saw the conflict with the Churches as a priority concern, and anti-church and anti-clerical sentiments were strong among grassroots party activists.<ref name="Ian Kershaw p.381-382"/> But Catholics constituted about a third of the population, and in the short term, and from political considerations, Hitler was prepared to restrain his anti-clericalism, seeing danger in strengthening the Church by persecution, though he intended a show-down after the war:<ref name="Hitler p219">[[Alan Bullock]]; ''[[Hitler: a Study in Tyranny]]''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219"</ref> In his semi-autobiographical ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler presented a [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] vision, in which the universe is ordered around principles of struggle between weak and strong, rather than on conventional Christian notions long prominent in Germany.<ref>Laurence Rees; The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler; Ebury Press; 2012; p135.</ref>

In the 1920s and 1930s, Catholic leaders made a number of forthright attacks on Nazi ideology and the main Christian opposition to Nazism had come from the Catholic Church.<ref>[http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%20693.pdf ''The German Churches in the Third Reich'' by Franklin F.

"The agreement", wrote [[William Shirer]], "was hardly put to paper before it was being broken by the Nazi Government". On 25 July, the Nazis promulgated their sterilization law, an offensive policy in the eyes of the Catholic Church. Five days later, moves began to dissolve the Catholic Youth League. Clergy, nuns and lay leaders began to be targeted, leading to thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or "immorality".<ref name="William L.

By early 1937, the church hierarchy in Germany, which had initially attempted to co-operate with the new government, had become highly disillusioned. In March, [[Pope Pius XI]] issued the ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' encyclical - accusing the Nazi Government of violations of the 1933 Concordat, and further that it was sowing the "tares of suspicion, discord, hatred, calumny, of secret and open fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church".

Goebbels' orchestrated attack included a staged "morality trial" of 37 Franciscans.<ref name="Ian Kershaw p.381-382"/>

Rosenberg and Bormann actively collaborated in the Nazi program to eliminate Church influence - a program which included the abolition of religious services in schools; the confiscation of religious property; circulating anti-religious material to soldiers; and the closing of theological faculties.<ref>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Rosenberg.html Jewish Virtual Library - Alfred Rosenberg]</ref> As the war wore on, Hitler feared the idealism of Christians and said that while "bourgeois and Marxists" would not risk their lives, the truly dangerous people were "assassins whipped up by the black crows in confessionals [ie priests] or patriots from other countries now occupied". These "dunderheads", as Hitler called them, numbered a few hundred thousand in Germany and included "all leaders of opposition tendencies and particularly those of political Catholicism", and could be rounded up and shot within three days in the event of a mutiny.<ref>Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933<U+2013>1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.&nbsp;253<U+2013>254</ref>

==Catholic resistance in Nazi Germany (1933<U+2013>1945)==

===Foundations of Catholic resistance===
Though neither the Catholic nor Protestent churches as institutions were prepared to openly oppose the Nazi State, The churches provided the earliest and most enduring centres of systematic opposition to Nazi policies, and Christian morality and the anti-Church policies of the Nazis motivated many German resistors and provided impetus for the "moral revolt" of individuals in their efforts to overthrow Hitler.<ref name="Graml, Mommsen pp.198-199">Graml, Mommsen, Reichhardt & Wolf; ''The German Resistance to Hitler''; B. T. Batsford Ltd; London; 1970; pp.&nbsp;198<U+2013>199</ref> From the outset of Nazi rule in 1933, issues emerged which brought the Catholic church into conflict with the regime, and the historian Wolf cites events such as the [[July Plot]] of 1944 as having been "inconceivable without the spiritual support of church resistance".<ref name="Graml, Mommsen p.226">Graml, Mommsen, Reichhardt & Wolf; ''The German Resistance to Hitler''; B.

Smaller resistance groups were also heavily influenced by Christian morality.

===Limits of Catholic resistance in Germany===

The German Episcopate had various disagreements with the Nazi government, but it never declared an official sanction of the various attempts to overthrow the Hitler regime.<ref name="ReferenceB">Graml, Mommsen, Reichhardt & Wolf; The German Resistance to Hitler; B. T. Batsford Ltd; London; 1970; p.225</ref> The German bishops hoped for a [[quid pro quo]] that would protect Catholic schools, organisations, publications and religious observance.<ref>Theodore S. Hamerow; ''On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler''; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ISBN 0-674-63680-5; p. 199</ref>  The Vatican too persisted in seeking to maintain a "legal modus vivendi" with the regime.<ref name="ReferenceB" />

Clergy in the German Resistance had some independence from the state apparatus, and could thus criticise it, while not being close enough to the centre of power to take steps to  overthrow it. "Clerical resistors", wrote Theodore S. Hamerow, could "indirectly at least, articulate political dissent in the guise of pastoral stricture", but the problem for them lay in determining how far they should go in their criticism: "Should they confine themselves to religious and moral issues or should they deal with political and racial issues as well&nbsp;...". Faced with such questions, the German clergy generally determined that their first duty lay in the protection of their own church and its members, remaining within the limits of formal legality. Thus during the early years of Nazi Germany, clerical dissenters usually spoke out not against the established system, but "only against specific policies that it had mistakenly adopted and that it should therefore properly correct".<ref>Theodore S. Hamerow; ''On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler''; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ISBN 0-674-63680-5; p.&nbsp;131<U+2013>3</ref>

Before moving toward resistance, German Catholics and Protestants were also faced with overcoming nationalist sentiment, and an instinct to respect authority which was the inheritance of their religious and national outlooks.<ref name="Graml, Mommsen p.224">Graml, Mommsen, Reichhardt & Wolf; ''The German Resistance to Hitler''; B. T. Batsford Ltd; London; 1970; p.224</ref> In predominantly Protestant Germany, many Catholics were determined to prove that they were "good Germans" too, and avoid the trauma of another [[Kulturkampf]].<ref>Graml, Mommsen, Reichhardt & Wolf; ''The German Resistance to Hitler''; B. T. Batsford Ltd; London; 1970; p207</ref> Thus when Bishop August von Galen of Munich delivered his famous 1941 denunciations of Nazi euthanasia and the lawlessness of the Gestapo, he also said that the church had never sought the  "overthrow" of the regime.<ref name="Graml, Mommsen p.225"/> Yet from the early stages of Nazism, [[Nazi ideology]] and [[Catholic doctrine]] clashed - from [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s anti-Catholic stance in ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'', to the Nazi sterilization and euthanasia programs. The Nazis also moved early against the church's organisational interests - attacking Catholic schools and the Catholic press.<ref name="Graml, Mommsen p.224"/>

Hastings wrote that the early Nazi movement founded in Munich was essentially Catholic in religious orientation with Catholic student groups being influential in the founding of the movement and Catholic priests providing spiritual guidance.<ref>Hastings, 2009, p. 5, 6, 9, 14, 15, 64, 109, 110, 116, 119, 170, 179, 183-185 and pps 115, 120-122 for Catholic priest references.</ref> The events surrounding the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923 caused a rift between Catholic and Protestant members and thereafter the movement became predominately Protestant. Archbishop Betram sought to join the Nazi Party in 1932 with Archbishop Groeber joining the SS as a promotive member in 1933 and Bishop Hudal helping Nazi war criminals to escape after the war.<ref>Lapide, 1967, p. 92, 239; Phayer, 200, pp&nbsp;166<U+2013>169;"from the time Hitler came to power all the German bishops began declaring their appreciation of the important natural values of race and purity". This led German Catholics to dutifully obey and forget the warnings of the Bishops regarding immoral means in the defence of ones race".(Guenter Lewy, "The Catholic Church and Nazi Germany", p. 275)</ref>

According to Kershaw, the German church leadership expended considerable energies in opposing government interference in the churches and "attempts to ride roughshod over Christian doctrine and values", but this vigour, was not matched against  all areas of "Nazi barbarism". Thus for example, what protests the bishops did make regarding anti-Jewish policies, tended to be by way of private letters to government ministers.<ref name="Ian Kershaw pp210-11">Ian Kershaw; ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation; 4th Edn; Oxford University Press; New York; 2000; pp&nbsp;210<U+2013>11</ref> Kershaw wrote that, while the "detestation of Nazism was overwhelming within the Catholic Church", it did not preclude church leaders approving of areas of the regime's policies, particularly where Nazism "blended into 'mainstream' national aspirations" - like support for "patriotic" foreign policy or war aims, obedience to state authority (where this did not contravene divine law); and destruction of atheistic Marxism and Soviet Bolshevism. Traditional Christian anti-Judaism was "no bulwark" against Nazi biological antisemitism, wrote Kershaw, and on these issues "the churches as institutions felt on uncertain grounds". Opposition was generally left to fragmented and largely individual efforts.<ref>Ian Kershaw; ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation; 4th Edn; Oxford University Press; New York; 2000; p.&nbsp;211<U+2013>12</ref>

Historian [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]] has called 'the idea that the Catholic Church almost universally opposed Nazism, 'as questionable as the contrary thesis of a Communist mass movement against Hitler', and attributed the Centre Party's paralysis to Catholicism's 'flirtation with the new regime'.<ref name="BracherThe" /> Mary Fulbrook wrote that when politics encroached on the church, Catholics were prepared to resist, but that the record was otherwise patchy and uneven, and that, with notable exceptions, "it seems that, for many Germans, adherence to the Christian faith proved compatible with at least passive acquiescence in, if not active support for, the Nazi dictatorship".<ref name="MaryFulbrook" /> [[Pinchas Lapide]] wrote that in 1939 close to half the population of the Greater German Reich was Catholic and despite pressure to leave 22.7% of the [[SS]] were Catholics.<ref>Lapide, 1967, p. 237</ref>

===Institutional resistance===

Institutionally, the Catholic Church in Germany offered organised, systematic and consistent resistance to the policies of the Third Reich which infringed on ecclesiastical autonomy.<ref>Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ISBN 0-674-63680-5; p.210</ref> As one of the few German institutions to retain some independence from the state, it was able to continue to co-ordinate a level of opposition to Government, and  the churches, more than any other institutions, continued to provide a "forum in which  individuals could distance themselves from the regime".<ref name="Plotting Hitler's Death p.32">[[Joachim Fest]]; ''Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933<U+2013>1945''; Weidenfield & Nicolson; London; p.32</ref> In the words of Kerhsaw, the churches "engaged in a bitter war of attrition with the regime, receiving the demonstrative backing of millions of churchgoers. Applause for Church leaders whenever they appeared in public, swollen attendances at events such as Corpus Christi Day processions, and packed church services were outward signs of the struggle of&nbsp;... especially of the Catholic Church - against Nazi oppression". While the Church ultimately failed to protect its youth organisations and schools, it did have some successes in mobilizing public opinion to alter government policies.<ref name="Ian Kershaw pp210-11"/> The churches challenged Nazi efforts to undermine various Christian institutions, practices and beliefs and Bullock wrote that "among the most courageous demonstrations of opposition during the war were the sermons preached by the [[Clemens August Graf von Galen|Catholic Bishop of Munster]] and the Protestant Pastor, [[Martin Neimoller|Dr Niemoller]]&nbsp;..." but that nevertheless, "Neither the Catholic Church nor the Evangelical Church&nbsp;... as institutions, felt it possible to take up an attitude of open opposition to the regime".<ref>Alan Bullock; Hitler, a Study in Tyranny; HarperPerennial Edition 1991</ref>

===Resistance by clergy and religious===

====German Hierarchy====
The 1933 [[Reich concordat]] between Germany and the Vatican prohibited clergy from participating in politics and in the aftermath of the Nazi takeover and signing of the Concordat, the outspoken nature of opposition by German Catholic leaders towards the Nazi movement weakened considerably.<ref name="Plotting Hitler's Death p.31"/> But it was from the clergy that the first major component of the German Resistance to the policies of the Third Reich emerged. "From the very beginning", wrote Hamerow, "some churchmen expressed, quite directly at times, their reservations about the new order. In fact those reservations gradually came to form a coherent, systematic critique of many of the teachings of National Socialism."<ref name="Theodore S. Hamerow p. 133">Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ISBN 0-674-63680-5; p. 133</ref> Later, the most trenchant public criticism of the Third Reich came from some of Germany's religious leaders, as the government was reluctant to move against them, and though they could claim to be merely attending to the spiritual welfare of their flocks, "what they had to say was at times so critical of the central doctrines of National Socialism that to say it required great boldness", and they became resistors. Their resistance was directed not only against intrusions by the government into church governance and to arrests of clergy and expropriation of church property, but also to matters like Nazi euthanasia and eugenics and to the fundamentals of human rights and justice as the foundation of a political system.<ref>Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ISBN 0-674-63680-5; p.&nbsp;288<U+2013>9</ref>

A senior cleric could rely on a degree of popular support from the faithful, and thus the regime had to consider the possibility of nationwide protests if such figures were arrested.<ref name="Theodore S. Hamerow p. 133"/> While hundreds of ordinary priests and members of monastic orders were sent to concentration camps throughout the Nazi period, just one German Catholic bishop was briefly imprisoned in a concentration camp, and just one other expelled from his diocese.<ref>Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ISBN 0-674-63680-5; p.&nbsp;196<U+2013>7</ref> This reflected also the cautious approach adopted by the hierarchy, who felt secure only in commenting on matters which transgressed on the ecclesiastical sphere.<ref>Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ISBN 0-674-63680-5; p. 197</ref>

Hamerow characterised the resistance approach of senior Catholic clergy like August von Galen of Munich as "trying to influence the Third Reich from within". While some clergymen refused ever to feign support for the regime, in the Church's conflict with the state over ecclesiastical autonomy, the Catholic hierarchy adopted a strategy of "seeming acceptance of the Third Reich", by couching their criticisms as motivated merely by a desire to "point out mistakes that that some of its overzealous followers committed" in order to strengthen the government.<ref>Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ISBN 0-674-63680-5; p. 198</ref>  Cardinal Bertram of Breslau, the chairman of the German Conference of Bishops, developed a protest system which "satisfied the demands of the other bishops without annoying the regime".<ref name="Plotting Hitler's Death p.32"/> Firmer resistance by Catholic leaders gradually reasserted itself by the individual actions of leading churchmen like [[Joseph Frings]], [[Konrad von Preysing]], August von Galen and [[Michael von Faulhaber]]. But the German Episcopate was divided over relations with the Nazi regime - figures like Cardinal Bertram, favoured a policy of concessions, while figures like Bishop Preysing called for more concerted opposition.<ref>Guenter Lewy, The Catholic Church and Nazi Germany, p.xix-xx</ref> According to [[Michael Phayer]], in relation to the mistreatment of Jews, "no other German bishops spoke as pointedly as Preysing and Frings".<ref>Phayer, Michael. 2000.

On 22 March 1942, the German Bishops issued a pastoral letter on "The Struggle against Christianity and the Church".<ref>Joachim Fest; Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933<U+2013>1945; Weidenfield & Nicolson; London; p.377</ref> The letter launched a defence of human rights and the rule of law and accused the Reich Government of "unjust oppression and hated struggle against Christianity and the Church", despite the loyalty of German Catholics to the Fatherland, and brave service of Catholics soldiers. It accused the regime of seeking to rid Germany of Christianity:<ref name="Catholic Church p.74-80">''The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church''; [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|National Catholic Welfare Conference]]; Washington D.C.; 1942; p.&nbsp;74<U+2013>80.</ref>

Repeatedly the German bishops have asked the Reich Government to discontinue this fatal struggle; but unfortunately our appeals and our endeavours were without success.|22 March 1942 Pastoral Letter of the German Bishops}}

The letter outlined serial breaches of the 1933 Concordat, reitereated complaints of the suffocation of Catholic schooling, presses and hospitals and said that the "Catholic faith has been restricted to such a degree that it has disappeared almost entirely from public life" and even worship within churches in Germany "is frequently restricted or oppressed", while in the conquered territories (and even in the Old Reich), churches had been "closed by force and even used for profane purposes". The freedom of speech of clergymen had been suppressed and priests were being "watched constantly" and punished for fulfilling "priestly duties" and incarcerated in Concentration camps without legal process. Religious orders had been expelled from schools, and their properties seized, while seminaries had been confiscated "to deprive the Catholic priesthood of successors".<ref name="Catholic Church p.74-80"/>

The bishops denounced the Nazi euthanasia program and declared their support for human rights and personal freedom under God and "just laws" of all people:<ref name="Catholic Church p.74-80"/>

====Notable resistors====

;Faulhaber

Cardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] gained an early reputation as a critic of the Nazi movement.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica Online 2013">Encyclopedia Britannica Online: ''Michael von Faulhaber''; web Apr. 2013.</ref> Soon after the Nazi takeover, his three Advent sermons of 1933, entitled ''Judaism, Christianity, and Germany'', affirmed the Jewish origins of the Christian religion, the continuity of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible, and the importance of the Christian tradition to Germany.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica Online 2013"/> Though Faulhaber's words were cautiously framed as a discussion of ''historical'' Judaism, his sermons denounced the Nazi extremists who were calling for the Bible to be purged of the "Jewish" Old Testament as a grave threat to Christianity: in seeking to adhere to the central tenet of Nazism, "The anti-Semitic zealots&nbsp;..." wrote Hamerow, were also undermining "the basis of Catholicism. Neither accommodation, nor acquiescence was possible any longer; the cardinal had to face the enemy head on."<ref>Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ISBN 0-674-63680-5; p. 140</ref>

Hamerow wrote that Faulhaber would look to avoid conflict with the state over issues not strictly pertaining to the church, but on issues involving the defence of Catholics he "refused to compromise or retreat".<ref name="Theodore S. Hamerow pp.200-202">Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ISBN 0-674-63680-5; pp.&nbsp;200<U+2013>202</ref>  On November 4, 1936, Hitler and Faulhaber met. Faulhaber told Hitler that the Nazi government had been waging war on the church for three years and had instituted laws the Church could not accept - like the sterilization of criminals and the handicapped. While the Catholic Church respected the notion of authority, he told the Dictator, "when your officials or your laws offend Church dogma or the laws of morality, and in so doing offend our conscience, then we must be able to articulate this as responsible defenders of moral laws".<ref>Richard Bonney Confronting the Nazi War on Christianity: the Kulturkampf Newsletters, 1936<U+2013>1939; International Academic Publishers; Bern; 2009 ISBN 978-3-03911-904-2; pp. 122</ref> When in 1937 the authorities in Upper Bavaria attempted to replace Catholic schools with "common schools", he offered fierce resistance.<ref name="Theodore S. Hamerow pp.200-202"/>

While Hamerow viewed Faulhaber as essentially a defender of "Catholic interests", other sources credit him with greater defiance. According to the [[Encyclopedia Britannica]], "Throughout his sermons until the collapse (1945) of the Third Reich, Faulhaber vigorously criticized Nazism, despite governmental opposition. Attempts on his life were made in 1934 and in 1938. He worked with American occupation forces after the war, and received the West German Republic's highest award, the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica Online 2013"/> During the 1938 ''Kristallnacht'' pogrom, Faulhaber supplied a truck to rabbi of the [[Ohel Yaakov Synagogue]], to rescue sacred objects before the building was torn down. Following mass demonstrations against Jews and Catholics, a Nazi mob attacked Faulhaber's palace, and smashed its windows.<ref name="MartinGilbert">Martin Gilbert; ''Kristallnacht - Prelude to Disaster''; HarperPress; 2006; p.143</ref>

;Preysing
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2006-0217, Berlin, Ansprache des neuen Bischofs Preysing.jpg|thumb|upright|Bishop [[Konrad von Preysing]] was Bishop of Berlin, the capital city of Nazi Germany. He provided aid to the city's Jews and had links to the [[German Resistance]].]]

Among the most firm and consistent of senior Catholics to oppose the Nazis was [[Konrad von Preysing]]. Preysing served as Bishop of Eichstatt from 1932 to 1935 and in 1935 was appointed as Bishop of Berlin - the capital of Nazi Germany. Preysing was loathed by Hitler, who said "the foulest of carrio are those who come clothed in the cloak of humility and the foulest of these Count Presying! What a beast!".<ref>Richard Bonney ''Confronting the Nazi War on Christianity: the Kulturkampf Newsletters, 1936<U+2013>1939''; International Academic Publishers; Bern; 2009 ISBN 978-3-03911-904-2; pp.&nbsp;29<U+2013>30</ref> Von Preysing opposed the appeasing attitudes of Bertram towards the Nazis and was one of the most firm and consistent church opponents of Hitler. He spoke out in public sermons and argued the case for firm opposition at bishops' conferences. He also worked with leading members of the resistance [[Carl Goerdeler]] an [[Helmuth James Graf von Moltke]]. He was part of the five-member commission that prepared the papal encyclical ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' anti-Nazi encyclical of March 1937 and sought to block the Nazi closure of Catholic schools and arrests of church officials.<ref name="Honourable Defeat pp.58-59">[[Anton Gill]]; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; pp.&nbsp;58<U+2013>59</ref><ref name="Konrad Graf von Preysing">[http://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/index_of_persons/ Konrad Graf von Preysing]; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013</ref> In 1938, he became one of the co-founders of the ''Hilfswerk beim Bisch<U+00F6>flichen Ordinariat Berlin'' (Welfare Office of the Berlin Diocese Office). He extended care to both baptised and unbaptised Jews and protested the Nazi euthanasia programme.<ref name="Konrad Graf von Preysing"/> His Advent Pastoral Letters of 1942 and 1943 on the nature of human rights reflected the anti-Nazi theology of the [[Barmen Declaration]] of the [[Confessing Church]], leading one to be broadcast in German by the BBC. In 1944, Preysing met with and gave a blessing to [[Claus von Stauffenberg]], in the lead up to the [[July Plot]] to assassinate Hitler, and spoke with the resistance leader on whether the need for radical change could justify [[tyrannicide]].<ref name="Honourable Defeat pp.58-59"/> Despite Preysing's open opposition, the Nazis did not dare arrest him and several months after the end of the war he was named a cardinal by [[Pope Pius XII]].<ref name="Konrad Graf von Preysing"/>

;Galen

The Bishop of Munster, August von Galen was Preysing's cousin. Himself a German conservative and nationalist, in January 1934 he criticised Nazi racial policy in a sermon and in subsequent homilies, equated unquestioning loyalty to the Reich with "slavery" and spoke against Hitler's theory of the purity of German blood.<ref name="Honourable Defeat p.59">Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.59</ref> In response to Nazi Ideologist [[Alfred Rosenberg]]''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'', Galen derided the neo-pagan theories of Rosenberg as perhaps no more than "an occasion for laughter in the educated world", but warned that "his immense importance lies in the acceptance of his basic notions as the authentic philosophy of National Socialism and in his almost unlimited power in the field of German education. Herr Rosenberg must be taken seriously if the German situation is to be understood."<ref>Richard Bonney; ''Confronting the Nazi War on Christianity: the Kulturkampf Newsletters, 1936<U+2013>1939''; International Academic Publishers; Bern; 2009 ISBN 978-3-03911-904-2; pp. 128</ref>

When in 1933, the Nazi school superintendent of Munster issued a decree that religious instruction be combined with discussion of the "demoralising power" of the "people of Israel", Galen refused, writing that such interference in curriculum was a breach of the Concordat and that he feared children would be confused as to their "obligation to act with charity to all men" and as to the historical mission of the people of Israel.<ref name="Theodore S. Hamerow p. 139"/> Often Galen directly protested to Hitler over violations of the Concordat. When in 1936, Nazis removed crucifixes in school, protest by Galen led to public demonstration. Like Presying, he assisted with the drafting of the 1937 papal encyclical.<ref name="Honourable Defeat p.59"/>

In 1941, with the Wermacht still marching on Moscow, Galen the old nationalist, denounced the lawlessness of the Gestapo, the confiscations of church properties and the cruel program of Nazi euthanasia.<ref name="ReferenceC">Encyclopedia Britannica Online: ''Blessed Clemens August, Graf von Galen''; web Apr 2013.</ref> He attacked the Gestapo for converting church properties to their own purposes - including use as cinemas and brothels.<ref name="Honourable Defeat p.60">Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.60</ref> Galen protested the mistreatment of Catholics in Germany: the arrests and imprisonment without legal process, the suppression of the monasteries, the expulsion of religious orders. But his sermons went further than defending the church, he spoke of a moral danger to Germany from the regime's violations of basic human rights: "the right to life , to inviolability, and to freedom is an indispensable part of any moral social order", he said - and any government that punishes without court proceedings "undermines its own authority and respect for its sovereignty  within the conscience of its citizens".<ref name="Theodore S.

;Frings

Josef Frings became [[Archbishop of Cologne]] in 1942 and his consecration was used as a demonstration of Catholic self-assertion. In his sermons, he repeatedly spoke in support of persecuted peoples and against state repression. In March 1944, Frings attacked arbitrary arrests, racial persecution and forced divorces. That autumn, he protested to the Gestapo against the deportations of Jews from Cologne and surrounds.<ref name="Josef Frings">[http://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/index_of_persons/ Josef Frings]; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013</ref> In 1943, the German bishops had debated whether to directly confront Hitler collectively over what they knew of the murdering of Jews. Frings wrote a pastoral letter cautioning his diocese not to violate the inherent rights of others to life, even those "not of our blood" and even during war, and preached in a sermon that "no one may take the property or life of an innocent person just because he is a member of a foreign race".<ref name="yadvashem.org">http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/education/courses/life_lessons/pdfs/lesson8_4.pdf</ref> Following war's end, Frings succeeded Bertram as chairman of the Fulda Bishops' Conference in July 1945 and in 1946 he was appointed a cardinal by Pius XII.<ref name="Josef Frings"/>

====German Priests and religious====

[[File:RupertMayer.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Blessed [[Rupert Mayer]] SJ was sent to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] in 1939.]]

While Hitler did not feel powerful enough to arrest senior clergy before the end of the war, an estimated one third of German priests faced some form of reprisal from the Nazi government and 400 German priests were sent to the dedicated [[Priest Barracks of Dachau|Priest Barracks]] of [[Dachau Concentration Camp]] alone. Among the best known German priest martyrs were the Jesuit [[Alfred Delp]] and Fr [[Bernhard Lichtenberg]].<ref name="Ian Kershaw pp210-11"/>

While Bishop von Preysing was protected from Nazi retaliation by his position, his cathedral administrator and confidant, [[Bernard Lichtenberg]], was not. A strong opponent of Nazism, Lichtenberg had been active with the Catholic Centre Party.<ref name="Bernhard Lichtenberg">[http://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/index_of_persons/ Bernhard Lichtenberg]; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013</ref> Lichtenberg served at [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral]] from 1932, and was under the watch of the Gestapo by 1933, for his courageous support of prisoners and Jews. He became a confidante of Bishop von Preysing from 1935.<ref name="Bernhard Lichtenberg"/> He ran Preysing's aid unit (the ''Hilfswerke beim Bisch<U+00F6>flichen Ordinariat Berlin'') which secretly gave assistance to those who were being persecuted by the regime.<ref name="Honourable Defeat p.60"/> From the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' pogrom of November 1938 onward, Lichtenberg closed each nightly service with a prayer for "the Jews, and the poor prisoners in the concentration camps", including "my fellow priests there".<ref name="Honourable Defeat p.60"/><ref name="Martin Gilbert p.159">Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p. 159</ref> On 23 October 1942, he offered a prayer for the Jews being deported to the East, telling his congregation to extend to the Jews the commandment of Christ to "Love thy neighbour".<ref name="Martin Gilbert p.159"/> For preaching against Nazi propaganda and writing a letter of protest concerning Nazi euthanasia, he was arrested in 1941, sentenced to two years' penal servitude, and died en route to Dachau Concentration Camp in 1943.<ref name="Honourable Defeat p.60"/> He was subsequently honoured by [[Yad Vashem]] as [[Righteous among the Nations]].<ref name="catholicherald.co.uk">{{cite web|last=Coppen |first=Luke |url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/features/2011/01/19/ten-catholic-heroes-of-the-holocaust/ |title=Ten Catholic heroes of the Holocaust |publisher=[[Catholic Herald]] |date=2011-01-19 |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref>

The Blessed [[Rupert Mayer]], a Bavarian Jesuit and World War One army chaplain, had clashed with the National Socialists as early as 1923. Continuing his critique following Hitler's rise to power, Mayer was imprisoned in 1939 and sent to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]. As his health declined, the Nazis feared the creation of a martyr and sent him to the Abbey of Ettal, but Myer died in 1945.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/pontiff-praises-a-bavarian-foe-of-nazism |title=Pontiff Praises a Bavarian Foe of Nazism |publisher=[[Zenit News Agency]] |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=472 |title=Library : The Gentile Holocaust |publisher=Catholic Culture |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref>

[[Laurentius Siemer]], Provincial of the Dominican Province of Teutonia, became a steadfast opponent of the Nazi regime and had contacts with the Resistance. The Gestapo arrested Siemer in Cologne in 1935, as part of the "Currency Fraud Cases" targeting Catholic clergy, and held him in custody for several months. He was influential in the Committee for Matters Relating to the Orders, which formed in response to Nazi attacks against Catholic monasteries and aimed to encourage the bishops to intercede on behalf of the Orders and oppose the Nazi state more emphatically. He spoke to resistance circles on the subject of Catholic social teaching as the starting point for the reconstruction of Germany, and worked with [[Carl Goerdeler]] and others in planning for a post-coup Germany. Following the failure of the July Plot, Siemer evaded capture and hid out until the end of the war.<ref>[http://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/index_of_persons/ Laurentius Siemer]; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013</ref>

Also involved in the German Resistance was Christian workers' movement activist and Centre Party politician Fr. [[Otto M<U+00FC>ller (priest)|Otto M<U+00FC>ller]]. M<U+00FC>ller was among those who argued for a firm line from the German bishops against legal violations of the Nazis. In contact with the German military opposition before the outbreak of war, he later allowed individual opposition figures the use of the Ketteler-Haus in Cologne for their discussions and was involved with Catholic politicians and July Plotters [[Jakob Kaiser]], [[Nikolaus Gro<U+00DF>]] and [[Bernhard Letterhaus]] in planning a post Nazi-Germany. After the failure of the [[July Plot]], the Gestapo arrested M<U+00FC>ller, who was imprisoned in the Berlin Police Hospital, where he died.<ref>[http://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/index_of_persons/ Otto M<U+00FC>ller]; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013</ref>

Parish priests such as the [[L<U+00FC>beck martyrs]] <U+2013> [[Johannes Prassek]], [[Eduard M<U+00FC>ller (martyr)|Eduard M<U+00FC>ller]] and [[Hermann Lange]], and the Lutheran pastor [[Karl Friedrich Stellbrink]] - also participated in localised resistance.

Fr. [[Max Josef Metzger]], a World War One military chaplain, had founded the German Catholics' Peace Association in 1919 and sought links to the international pacifist movement. As a leading German pacifist, he was targeted by the Nazi authorities and arrested on several occasions by the Gestapo. He was arrested for the last time in June 1943 after being denounced by a mail courier for attempting to send a memorandum on the reorganisation of the German state and its integration into a future system of world peace to the [[Erling Eidem]], the Swedish Archbishop of Uppsala. Sentenced to death, he was executed on April 17, 1944.<ref>[http://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/index_of_persons/ Max Josef Metzger]; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013</ref>

An old guard of national-conservatives aligned to [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]] broke with Hitler in the mid-1930s. According to Kershaw, they "despised the barbarism of the Nazi regime. But were keen to re-establish Germany's status as a major power&nbsp;...". Essentially authoritarian, they favoured monarchy and limited electoral rights "resting on Christian family values".<ref name="Ian Kershaw p.823">Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; WW Norton & Company; London; p. 823</ref> "Hitlerism is poison for the German soul", wrote Goerdeler, "Hitler is determined to destroy Christianity".<ref>Theodore S. Hamerow; ''On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler''; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ISBN 0-674-63680-5; p. 250</ref> A younger group, dubbed the "[[Kreisau Circle]]" by the Gestapo, did not look to German imperialism for inspiration.<ref name="Ian Kershaw p.823"/> Forming from 1937, though multi-denominational, it had a strongly Christian orientation, and looked for a general Christian revival, and reawakening of awareness of the transcendental. Its outlook was rooted both in German romantic and idealist tradition and in the Catholic doctrine of [[natural law]].<ref>Graml, Mommsen, Reichhardt & Wolf; ''The German Resistance to Hitler''; B. T. Batsford Ltd; London; 1970; p.&nbsp;100<U+2013>101</ref> The Circle looked to a federalised Europe along the lines of the United States as the desirable "new order", resting heavily on German Christian and social ideals, with self-governing communities rooted in social justice. The Circle pressed for a coup against Hitler, but being unarmed was dependent on persuading military figures to take action.<ref name="Ian Kershaw p.823"/>

[[File:AR<U+00F6>sch.jpg|thumb|[[Augustin R<U+00F6>sch]] (centre) was the wartime Jesuit Provincial of Bavaria and one of three Jesuits in the inner [[Kreisau Circle]] of the German Resistance.]]

Among the central membership of the Circle were the Jesuit Fathers [[Augustin R<U+00F6>sch]], [[Alfred Delp]] and [[Lothar K<U+00F6>nig]].<ref>Peter Hoffmann; ''The History of the German Resistance 1933<U+2013>1945''; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p33.</ref> [[Konrad von Preysing|Bishop von Preysing]] also had contact with the group.<ref name="Anton Gill p.161">Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p. 161</ref> Another non-military German Resistance group, dubbed the "Frau Solf Tea Party" by Gestapo, included the Jesuit Fr [[Friedrich Erxleben]].<ref>William L.

The Kreisau group combined conservative notions of reform with socialist strains of thought - a symbiosis expressed by Delp's notion of "personal socialism".<ref name="Graml, Mommsen pp 86-87">Graml, Mommsen, Reichhardt & Wolf; The German Resistance to Hitler; B.

So long as people lacked dignity, they would be incapable of prayer or thought.<ref>Graml, Mommsen, Reichhardt & Wolf; The German Resistance to Hitler; B. T. Batsford Ltd; London; 1970; p.67</ref> In ''Die dritte Idee'' (The Third Idea), Delp expounded on the notion of a third way, which, as opposed to Communism and Capitalism, might restore the unity of the person and society.<ref>Graml, Mommsen, Reichhardt & Wolf; The German Resistance to Hitler; B. T. Batsford Ltd; London; 1970; p.142</ref>

The so-called "[[Solf Circle|Frau Solf Tea Party]]" group included another Jesuit, Fr [[Friedrich Erxleben]]. The purpose of the Solf Circle was to seek out humanitarian ways of countering the Nazi regime. It met at either Frau Solf or [[Elizabeth von Thadden]]'s home.

In effort to counter the strength and influence of spiritual resistance, Nazi security services monitored Catholic clergy very closely - instructing that agents be set up in every diocese, that the bishops' reports to the Vatican should be obtained and that the bishops' areas of activity must be found out. A "vast network" was established to monitor the activities of ordinary clergy: Nazi security agents wrote "The importance of this enemy is such that inspectors of security police and of the security service will make this group of people and the questions discussed by them their special concern".<ref>Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933<U+2013>1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ISBN 0-85211-009-X; pp.&nbsp;141<U+2013>2</ref> Priests were frequently denounced, arrested and sent to concentration camps, often simply on the basis of being "suspected of activities hostile to the State" or that there was reason to "suppose that his dealings might harm society".<ref>Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933<U+2013>1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ISBN 0-85211-009-X; pp. 142</ref>

[[Dachau Concentration Camp|Dachau]] was established in March 1933 as the first [[Nazi Concentration Camp]]. Chiefly a political camp, it was here that the Nazis established dedicated [[Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp|Clergy Barracks]].<ref>Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica: ''Dachau'', by Michael Berenbaum.</ref><ref name="Paul Berben pp. 276-277">Paul Berben; ''Dachau: The Official History 1933<U+2013>1945''; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ISBN 0-85211-009-X; pp.&nbsp;276<U+2013>277</ref> Of a total of 2,720 clergy recorded as imprisoned at Dachau, some 2,579 (or 94.88%) were Catholic and a total of 1,034 clergy were recorded overall as dying in the camp, with 132 "transferred or liquidated" during that time - although R. Schnabel's 1966 investigation found an alternative total of 2,771, with 692 noted as deceased and 336 sent out on "invalid trainloads" and therefore presumed dead.<ref name="Paul Berben pp. 276-277"/>

[[File:ZawistowskiAntoni.jpg|thumb|upright|The Blessed [[Antoni Zawistowski]] was tortured and died at Dachau in 1942. 1780 Polish clergy were sent to Dachau, and many are remembered among the [[108 Martyrs of World War II|108 Polish Martyrs of World War II]].]]

By far the greatest number of priest prisoners came from Poland - in all some 1,748 Polish Catholic clerics, of whom some 868 died in the camp.<ref name="Paul Berben pp. 276-277"/> Germans constituted the next largest group - 411 German Catholic priests were sent to Dachau, of whom 94 died in the camp and 100 were "transferred or liquidated".<ref name="Ian Kershaw pp210-11"/><ref name="Paul Berben pp. 276-277"/> France contributed the next main group, with 153 Catholic clerics, among whom ten died at the camp.<ref name="Paul Berben pp. 276-277"/> Other Catholic priests were sent from Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Hungary and Rumania, while from outside the Nazi Empire - 2 British and one Spaniard were incarcerated at Dachau, as well as one "stateless" priest.<ref name="Paul Berben pp. 276-277"/>

In December 1935, [[:de:Wilhelm von Braun (Jurist)|Wilhelm Braun]], a Catholic theologian from Munich, became the first churchman imprisoned at Dachau. The annexation of Austria saw an increase in clerical inmates. Berben wrote: "The commandant at the time, Loritz, persecuted them with ferocious hatred, and unfortunately he found some prisoners to help the guards in their sinister work".<ref>Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933<U+2013>1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ISBN 0-85211-009-X; p.&nbsp;143<U+2013>145.</ref> Despite SS hostility to religious observance, the Vatican and German bishops successfully lobbied the regime to concentrate clergy at one camp and obtained permission to build a chapel, for the priests to live communally and for time to be allotted to them for the religious and intellectual activity. From December 1940, priests were gathered in Blocks 26, 28 - and 30, though only temporarily. 26 became the international block and 28 was reserved for Poles - the most numerous group.<ref>Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933<U+2013>1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ISBN 0-85211-009-X; p.&nbsp;145<U+2013>6.</ref>

Conditions varied for prisoners in the camp. The Nazis introduced a racial hierarchy - keeping Poles in harsh conditions, while favouring German priests.<ref>Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933<U+2013>1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ISBN 0-85211-009-X; p.148.</ref> Many Polish priests simply died of the cold, not given sufficient clothing. A large number died in horrific Nazi medical experiments. Several Poles met their deaths via the "invalid trains" sent out from the camp, others were liquidated in the camp and given bogus death certificates. Some died of cruel punishment for misdemeanors - beaten to death or worked to exhaustion.<ref>Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933<U+2013>1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ISBN 0-85211-009-X; p.&nbsp;148<U+2013>9.</ref>

Religious activity outside the chapel was totally forbidden.<ref>Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933<U+2013>1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ISBN 0-85211-009-X; p.156.</ref> Priests would secretly take confessions and distribute the Eucharist among other prisoners.<ref>Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933<U+2013>1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ISBN 0-85211-009-X; p.157.</ref>

Amid the Nazi persecution of the Tirolian Catholics, the Blessed [[Otto Neururer]], a parish priest was sent to Dachau for "slander to the detriment of German marriage", after he advised a girl against marrying the friend of a senior Nazi.

===="Euthanasia"====
{{main|Nazi euthanasia and the Catholic Church}}

[[File:CAvGalenBAMS200612.jpg|thumb|upright|The Blessed [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]], [[Bishop of Munster]] spoke out against [[euthanasia in Nazi Germany]].<ref>Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p265</ref>]]

While the Nazi ''[[Final Solution]]'' liquidation of the Jews took place primarily on Polish territory, the murder of invalids took place on German soil, and involved interference in Catholic (and Protestant) welfare institutions. Awareness of the murderous programme therefore became widespread, and the Church leaders who opposed it - chiefly the Catholic Bishop of Munster, [[August von Galen]] and Dr [[Theophil Wurm]], the Protestant Bishop of Wurttemberg - were therefore able to rouse widespread public opposition.<ref name="Peter Hoffmann p.24">Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933<U+2013>1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.24</ref> The intervention led to, in the words of Evans, "the strongest, most explicit and most widespread protest movement against any policy since the beginning of the Third Reich."<ref name="Richard">Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; Penguin Press; New York 2009, p.98</ref>

From 1939, the regime began its program of [[euthanasia in Nazi Germany|euthanasia]], under which those deemed "racially unfit" were to be "euthanased".<ref name="autogenerated1">Encyclopedia Britannica Online: ''Blessed Clemens August, Graf von Galen''; web Apr 2013</ref> The senile, the mentally handicapped and mentally ill, epileptics, cripples, children with [[Down's Syndrome]] and people with similar afflictions were all were to be killed.<ref name="Honourable Defeat p.60" /> The program ultimately involved the systematic murder of more than 70,000 people.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Among those murdered, a cousin of the young [[Joseph Ratzinger]], future [[Pope Benedict XVI]].<ref name="catholicnewsagency.com">[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/column.php?n=1657 The Church and Nazi Germany: Opposition, Acquiescence and Collaboration II]; Catholic News Agency; 3 October 2011; retrieved 17 September 2013</ref>

The Papacy and German bishops had already protested against the Nazi sterilization of the "racially unfit". Catholic protests against the escalation of this policy into "euthanasia" began in the summer of 1940. Despite Nazi efforts to transfer hospitals to state control, large numbers of handicapped people were still under the care of the Churches. Caritas was the chief organisation running such care services for the Catholic Church. After Protestant welfare activists took a stand at the Bethel Hospital in August von Galen's diocese, Galen wrote to Bertram in July 1940 urging the Church take up a moral position. Bertram urged caution. Archbishop [[Conrad Groeber]] of Freiburg wrote to the head of the Reich Chancellery, and offered to pay all costs being incurred by the state for the "care of mentally people intended for death". Caritas directors sought urgent direction from the bishops, and the Fulda Bishops Conference sent a protest letter to the Reich Chancellery on 11 August, then sent Bishop [[Heinrich Wienken]] of Caritas to discuss the matter. Wienken cited the commandment "thous shalt not kill" to officials and warned them to halt the program or face public protest from the Church. Wienken subsequently wavered, fearing a firm line might jeopardise his efforts to have Catholic priests released from Dachau, but was urged to stand firm by Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber. The government refused to give a written undertaking to halt the program, and the Vatican declared on 2 December that the policy was contrary to natural and positive Divine law: "The direct killing of an innocent person because of mental or physical defects is not allowed".<ref>Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; Penguin Press; New York 2009, pp.&nbsp;95<U+2013>97</ref>

Bishop von Galen had the decree printed in his newspaper on 9 March 1941. Subsequent arrests of priests and seizure of Jesuit properties by the Gestapo in his home city of Munster, convinced Galen that the caution advised by his superior had become pointless. On 6, 13 and 20 July 1941, Galen spoke against the seizure of properties, and expulsions of nuns, monks and religious and criticised the euthanasia programme. In an attempt to cow Galen, the police raided his sister's convent, and detained her in the cellar. She escaped the confinement, and Galen, who had also received news of the imminent removal of further patients, launched his most audacious challenge on the regime in a 3 August sermon. He declared the murders to be illegal, and said that he had formally accused those responsible for murders in his diocese in a letter to the public prosecutor. The policy opened the way to the murder of all "unproductive people", like old horses or cows, including invalid war veterans: "Who can trust his doctor anymore?", he asked. He declared, wrote Evans, that Catholics must "avoid those who blasphemed, attacked their religion, or brought about the death of innocent men and women. Otherwise they would become involved in their guilt".<ref>Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; Penguin Press; New York 2009, pp.&nbsp;97<U+2013>98</ref> Galen said that it was the duty of Christians to resist the taking of human life, even if it meant losing their own lives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-9342909 |title=Encyclop<U+0107>dia Britannica's Reflections on the Holocaust |publisher=[[Britannica.com Inc.]] |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref>

"The sensation created by the sermons", wrote Evans, "was enormous".<ref name="Richard" /> Kershaw characterised Von Galen's 1941 "open attack" on the government's euthanasia program as a "vigorous denunciation of Nazi inhumanity and barbarism".<ref name="Ian Kershaw pp210-11"/> According to Gill, "Galen used his condemnation of this appalling policy to draw wider conclusions about the nature of the Nazi state.<ref name="Honourable Defeat p.60"/> Galen had the sermons read in parish churches. The British broadcast excerpts over the BBC German service, dropped leaflets over Germany, and distributed the sermons in occupied countries.<ref name="Richard" />

There were demonstrations across Catholic Germany - Hitler himself faced angry demonstrators at Nuremberg, the only time he was confronted with such resistance by ordinary Germans.<ref name="catholicnewsagency.com"/> The regime did not halt the murders, but took the program underground.<ref name="yadvashem.org"/> Bishop [[Antonius Hilfrich]] of Limburg wrote to the Justice Minister, denouncing the murders. Bishop [[Albert Stohr]] of Mainz condemned the taking of life from the pulpit. Some of the priests who distributed the sermons were among those arrested and sent to the concentration camps amid the public reaction to the sermons.<ref name="Richard" /> Bishop von Preysing's Cathedral Administrator, Fr [[Bernhard Lichtenberg]] met his demise for protesting directly to Dr Conti, the Nazi State Medical Director. On 28 August 1941, he endorsed Galen's sermons in a letter to Conti, pointing to the German constitution which defined euthanasia as an act of murder. He was arrested soon after and later died en route to Dachau.<ref>Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.61</ref> The regional Nazi leader, and Hitler's deputy [[Martin Bormann]] called for Galen to be hanged, but Hitler and Goebbels urged a delay in retribution till war's end.<ref>Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; Penguin Press; New York 2009, p.99</ref> With the programme now public knowledge, nurses and staff (particularly in Catholics institutions), now increasingly seeking to obstruct implementation of the policy, Hitler ordered a halt to the killing of adults (though maintained the easier to conceal murder of children).<ref>Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; Penguin Press; New York 2009, pp.&nbsp;99<U+2013>100</ref> Following the war, Pope Pius XII hailed von Galen a hero and promoted him to Cardinal.<ref name="catholicherald2004">{{cite web|url=http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/26th-november-2004/5/pope-to-beatify-lion-of-mnster |title=Pope To Beatify 'lion Of M<U+00FC>nster' |publisher=Catholic Herald Archive |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref>

In 1943, Pius issued the ''[[Mystici Corporis Christi]]'' encyclical, in which he condemned the practice of killing the disabled. He stated his "profound grief" at the murder of the deformed, the insane, and those suffering from hereditary disease&nbsp;... as though they were a useless burden to Society", in condemnation of the ongoing [[euthanasia in Nazi Germany|Nazi euthanasia program]]. The Encyclical was followed, on 26 September 1943, by an open condemnation by the German Bishops which, from every German pulpit, denounced the killing of "innocent and defenceless mentally handicapped, incurably infirm and fatally wounded, innocent hostages, and disarmed prisoners of war and criminal offenders, people of a foreign race or descent".<ref name="Richard J. Evans pp.529-30">Richard J. Evans; ''The Third Reich at War''; 2008 pp.&nbsp;529<U+2013>30</ref>

===Lay resistors===

[[File:E.Klausener0001.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Erich Klausener]], the head of [[Catholic Action]], was assassinated in In Hitler's bloody [[night of the long knives]] purge of 1934.<ref name="Ian Kershaw p.315">Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler a Biography''; 2008 Edn; W.W. Norton & Company; London; p.315</ref>]]

In his history of the German Resistance to Hitler, [[Anton Gill]] wrote that "more than anyone else, the Catholics showed their disapproval of the regime by huge gatherings" but that "this was the only collective resistance Catholics showed".<ref name="Honourable Defeat p.58">Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.58</ref> In 1935, in Hagen, Catholics gathered to protest against a performance of the Nazi playwright [[Edmund Kiss]]'s anti-Christian play ''Wittekind''. Police crushed the riot.<ref>Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.152</ref> In November 1936, the Oldenburg Nazis removed crucifixes from schools. Bishop Galen protested, which led to a public demonstration, and the cancellation of the order.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/223894/Blessed-Clemens-August-Graf-von-Galen Encyclopedia Britannica Online - ''Blessed Clemens August, Graf von Galen'']; web 3 July 2013</ref> In 1937, amidst harassment of the church and following the hundreds of arrests and closure of Catholic presses that followed the issuing of [[Pope Pius XI]]'s ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' encyclical, at least 800,000 people attended a pilgrimage centred on Aachen - a massive demonstration by the standards of the day - and some 60,000 attended the 700th anniversary of the bishopric of [[Franconia]] - about equal to the city's entire population.<ref name="Honourable Defeat p.58"/>

Following the outbreak of war, conscientious objectors were executed for treason, as with the Blessed [[Franz Jagerstatter]].<ref name="catholiceducation.org"/>

====Early resistance====

In the year following Hitler's "seizure of power", political players in Germany began wondering how the regime might be overthrown. The old political opponents of Nazism faced their final opportunity to halt the Nazification of Germany. The formerly influential Catholic aligned [[Catholic Centre Party|Centre Party]] and [[Bavarian People's Party]] were dissolved under terrorisation, and non-Nazi parties were prohibited under the proclamation of the "Unity of Party and State".<ref name="Peter Hoffmann p 7-8"/> The former Centre Party leader and Reich Chancellor [[Heinrich Br<U+00FC>ning]] looked for a way to oust Hitler, along with military chiefs [[Kurt von Schleicher]] and [[Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord]].<ref name="Peter Hoffmann p 25">Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933<U+2013>1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p 25</ref> [[Erich Klausener]], an influential civil servant and president of Berlin's [[Catholic Action]] group organised Catholic conventions in Berlin in 1933, and 1934. At the 1934 rally, he spoke against political oppression to a crowd of 60,000 following [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] - just six nights before Hitler struck in a bloody purge.<ref>Anton Gill; ''An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler''; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.59</ref>

The political temperature was also raised when the Conservative Catholic nobleman [[Franz von Papen]], who had helped Hitler to power and was serving as the Deputy Reich Chancellor, delivered an indictment of the Nazi government in his [[Marburg speech]] of 17 June 1934.<ref name="Peter Hoffmann p 25"/><ref>Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.xiv</ref> Papen's speech writer and advisor [[Edgar Jung]], a [[Catholic Action]] worker, seized the opportunity to reassert the Christian foundation of the state and the need to avoid agitation and propaganda.<ref name="John S. Conway pp.90-91" /> "It is time", the speech declared "to join together in fraternal friendship and respect for all our fellow countrymen, to avoid disturbing the labours of serious men and to silence fanatics". The speech was banned from the press.<ref name="John S. Conway pp.90-91">John S. Conway; The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933<U+2013>1945; Regent College Publishing; 2001; ISBN 1-57383-080-1 (USA);  pp.&nbsp;90<U+2013>91</ref> Jung had been a tireless opponent of the Nazis, and took every opportunity to undermine them. His speech pleaded for religious freedom, and rejected totalitarian aspirations in the field of religion. It was hoped the speech might spur a rising, centred on Hindenberg, Papen and the army.<ref name="Peter Hoffmann p 29">Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933<U+2013>1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p 29</ref>

Hitler decided to strike at his chief political opponents both within and without the Nazi movement in a bloody purge: the [[Night of the Long Knives]]. The purge lasted two days over 30 June and 1 July 1934.<ref>Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933<U+2013>1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p&nbsp;25<U+2013>26</ref> Leading rivals of Hitler in the Nazi movement were murdered, along with over 100 opposition figures, including high profile Catholic resistors. Erich Klausener became the first Catholic martyr. Hitler personally ordered the arrest of Jung and his transfer to Gestapo headquarters, Berlin. Like Klausener, he was murdered in the Long Knives purge.<ref name="John S. Conway pp.90-91"/> Papen, who was probably also listed for execution, protested, but fell back in line and did not challenge Hitler again.<ref name="Peter Hoffmann p 29"/>

The Church had resisted attempts by the new Nazi Government to close its youth organisations and [[Adalbert Probst]], the national director of the Catholic Youth Sports Association, was also eliminated in the purge - abducted and later found dead, allegedly "shot while trying to escape".<ref>John S. Conway; ''The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933<U+2013>1945''; p.92</ref><ref name="Lewis, Brenda Ralph 2000 p. 45">Lewis, Brenda Ralph (2000); ''Hitler Youth: the Hitlerjugend in War and Peace 1933<U+2013>1945''; MBI Publishing; ISBN 0-7603-0946-9; p. 45</ref><ref name="Lewis, Brenda Ralph 2000 p. 45"/>  The Catholic press was targeted too, with anti-Nazi journalist [[Fritz Gerlich]] among those murdered.<ref name="John S. Conway p.92"/>

On 2 August 1934, the aged President von Hindenberg died. The offices of President and Chancellor were combined, and Hitler ordered the Army to swear an oath directly to him. Hitler declared his "revolution" complete.<ref>Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933<U+2013>1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; pp.&nbsp;27<U+2013>28</ref>

====Catholic writers====
[[File:Gerlich.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Fritz Gerlich]], editor of Munich's Catholic weekly, ''Der Gerade Weg'', and critic of the Nazies, was among the high profile Catholic opposition figures targeted for assassination in the 1934 [[Night of the Long Knives]] purge.]]

The flourishing Catholic press of Germany faced censorship and closure under the Nazis. In 1933, the Nazis established a Reich Chamber of Authorship and Reich Press Chamber under the Reich Cultural Chamber of the Ministry for Propaganda. Writers had to be registered with the relevant chamber. On 10 May, "degenerate literary works" were burned by the thousand at the public squares of Berlin and other cities. As the Nazis asserted themselves, non-conformist writers were terrorised, their works burned, and fear pervaded. The June<U+2013>July 1934 [[Night of the Long Knives]] purge was the culmination of this early campaign.<ref>Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933<U+2013>1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.&nbsp;14<U+2013>15</ref> [[Fritz Gerlich]], the editor of Munich's Catholic weekly, ''Der Gerade Weg'', was killed in the purge for his strident criticism of the Nazi movement.<ref name="John S. Conway p.92"/>

The poet [[Ernst Wiechert]] delivered a speech at [[Munich University]], calling for love, compassion, truth, freedom and the law. He protested the government's attitudes to the arts, calling them "spiritual murder". He was arrested and taken to [[Dachau Concentration Camp]].<ref>Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933<U+2013>1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.30</ref>

The Blessed [[Nikolaus Gross]] was a Christian trade unionist, member of the Centre Party and director of the West German Workers' Newspaper ''Westdeutschen Arbeiterzeitung'', the newspaper of the Catholic Workers' movement. From early days an opponent of Nazism, he was declared an enemy of the state in 1938, and his newspaper was shut down. He continued to publish an underground edition and worked to rouse resistance among Catholic workers. Arrested in the [[July Plot]] round up, he was executed on 23 January 1945. He was declared a martyr and beatified by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2001.<ref>[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20011008&slug=saints08 Pope sets seven people on the path to sainthood; beatification opposed by man's son]; Seattle Times; 8 October 2001</ref><ref>[http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20011007_beat-gross_en.html Bl. Nikolaus Gross (1898<U+2013>1945)]; Vatican News Service; retrieved 12 September 2013</ref>

Writer and theologian [[Dietrich von Hildebrand]] was a vocal opponent of Hitler and Nazism. Blacklisted by the Nazi movement in the 1920s, he ran religious discussions in his Munich home from 1924 to 1930, which were attended by distinguished theologians such as [[Erich Przywara]], S.J., Mgrs [[Martin Grabmann]] and Konrad von Preysing. Following Hitler's seizure of power, he fled from Germany, first to Italy, and then to Vienna, Austria, where, with the support of Austrian Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] he founded and edited an anti-Nazi weekly paper, Der Christliche St<U+00E4>ndestaat ("The Christian Corporative State"). For this, he was sentenced to death in absentia by the Nazis. When Hitler annexed Austria in 1938, von Hildebrand was once again forced to flee, spending time in Switzerland, France (where he taught at the Catholic University of Toulouse until the Nazis invaded France in 1940), then to Portugal and finally to New York in 1940. There he taught philosophy at the Jesuit [[Fordham University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catholicauthors.com/vonhildebrand.html |title=Dietrich von Hildebrand |work=CatholicAuthors.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=2829&CFID=66142450&CFTOKEN=48642109 |title=Library : A Portrait of Dietrich von Hildebrand |publisher=Catholic Culture |date=1977-01-26 |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref>

Hundreds of arrests and closure of Catholic presses followed the issuing of [[Pope Pius XI]]'s ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' anti-Nazi encyclical.<ref name="Honourable Defeat p.58"/>

====Catholic Aid Agencies====

Members of Catholic aid agencies such as [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]] provided relief to victims of the Nazis and gathered intelligence on the fate of prisoners of the regime. Among the German laity, [[Gertrud Luckner]], was among the first to sense the genocidal inclinations of the Hitler regime and to take national action.<ref name="wnlibrary.com">[http://wnlibrary.com/Portabel%20Documents/T/The%20Catholic%20Church%20And%20The%20Holocaust%201930%20-%201965%20-%20Michael%20Phayer.pdf Michael Phayer; ''The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930<U+2013>1965'']; Indiana University Press; p.&nbsp;116<U+2013>117</ref> A pacifist and member of the [[German Catholics' Peace Association]], she had been supporting victims of political persecution since 1933 and from 1938 worked at the head office of the German Association of Catholic Charitable Organizations, "Caritas". Using international contacts she secured safe passage abroad for many refugees. She organized aid circles for Jews, assisted many to escape.<ref name="Gertrud Luckner">[http://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/index_of_persons/ Gertrud Luckner]; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013</ref> She cooperated with the priests [[Bernhard Lichtenberg]] and [[Alfred Delp]]. Following the outbreak of the war, she continued her work for the Jews through Caritas' war relief office - attempting to establish a national underground network through Caritas cells.<ref name="wnlibrary.com"/> She personally investigated the fate of the Jews being transported to the East and managed to obtain information on prisoners in concentration camps, and obtain clothing, food and money for forced labourers and prisoners of war.<ref name="Gertrud Luckner"/> Caritas secured safe emigration for hundreds of converted Jews, but Luckner was unable to organise an effective national underground network. She was arrested in 1943 and only narrowly escaped death in the concentration camps.<ref name="wnlibrary.com"/>

Social worker [[Margarete Sommer]] had been sacked from her welfare institute for refusing to teach the Nazi line on sterilization. In 1935, she took up a position at the Episcopal Diocesan Authority in Berlin, counselling victims of racial persecution for Caritas Emergency Relief. In 1941 she became director of the Welfare Office of the Berlin Diocesan Authority, under Bernhard Lichtenberg.<ref name="Margarete Sommer">[http://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/index_of_persons/ Margarete Sommer]; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013</ref> Following Lichtenberg's arrest, Sommer reported to Bishop [[Konrad von Preysing]].<ref name="Margarete Sommer"/> While working for the Welfare Office, Sommer coordinated Catholic aid for victims of racial persecution - giving spiritual comfort, food, clothing, and money. She gathered intelligence on the deportations of the Jews, and living conditions in concentration camps, as well as on SS firing squads, writing several reports on these topics from 1942, including an August 1942 report which reached Rome under the title "Report on the Exodus of the Jews".<ref name="Margarete Sommer"/>

====White Rose====

The [[White Rose]] group was formed by Munich University students and advocated non-violent resistance against the Hitler regime.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1751313/White-Rose#ref1111334 Encyclopedia Britannica Online - ''White Rose'']; web 29 June 2013</ref> From 1942, White Rose published leaflets to influence people against Nazism and militarism. They criticised the "anti-Christian" and "anti-social" nature of the war.<ref>Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.190</ref> Among the leaders of the group, [[Willi Graf]] had been involved with the banned Catholic Youth movement and [[Christoph Probst]] was baptised into the church on the day of his execution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.katjasdacha.com/whiterose/biographies/graf.html |title=The White Rose - Graf |work=Katjasdacha.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.katjasdacha.com/whiterose/biographies/probst.html |title=Christoph Hermann Probst |work=Katjasdacha.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref> The Lutheran [[Hans Scholl]] had read Bishop von Galen's 1941 sermons and had worked for Professor [[Carl Muth]], editor of the Catholic Magazine ''[[Hochland (magazine)|High Land]]'', which had been banned in 1941.<ref name="Anton Gill p.188"/> His sister [[Sophie Scholl]] had been influenced by [[Theodor Haecker]] to read [[John Henry Newman]]'s writings on conscience, sentiments echoed by Galen. The [[Scholl siblings]], [[Kurt Huber]], Willi Graf and [[Alexander Schmorell]] were caught and executed in 1943.<ref>Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; pp.&nbsp;194<U+2013>5</ref>

===Catholics in the German Resistance===

Though Catholics were prominent in the [[German Resistance]], according to Fest, it essentially consisted of a "motley collection of individuals who differed greatly in their social origins, habits of thought, political attitudes and methods of action" and was by and large slow to accept the need for violence to displace Hitler.<ref>[[Joachim Fest]]; ''Plotting Hitlers death:The German Resistance to Hitler 1933<U+2013>45''; Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1996 p.328</ref> A few civilian resistance groups developed, but the Army was the only organisation with the capacity to overthrow the government, and from within it a small number of officers came to present the most serious threat posed to the Nazi regime.<ref>Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.2</ref> The Foreign Office and the [[Abwehr]] (Military Intelligence) also provided vital support to the movement.<ref>Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.4</ref> But many of those in the military who ultimately chose to seek to overthrow Hitler had initially supported the regime, if not all of its methods. Hitler's 1938 purge of the military was accompanied by increased militancy in the Nazification of Germany, a sharp intensification of the persecution of Jews, and  daring foreign policy exploits, bringing Germany to the brink of war and it was at this time that the German Resistance emerged.<ref>Theodore S. Hamerow; ''On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler''; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ISBN 0-674-63680-5; pp.&nbsp;217<U+2013>219</ref>

The Resistance members were motivated by such factors as the mistreatment of Jews, harassment of the churches, and the harsh actions of Himmler and the Gestapo.<ref>[[Joachim Fest]]; Plotting Hitlers Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933<U+2013>45; Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1996 p.309</ref> In his history of the German Resistance, Peter Hoffmann wrote that "National Socialism was not simply a party like any other; with its total acceptance of criminality it was an incarnation of evil, so that all those whose minds were attuned to democracy, Christianity, freedom, humanity or even mere legality found themselves forced into alliance&nbsp;...".<ref>Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933<U+2013>1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.20</ref> The Nazi policy of ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' (forced conformity to the Nazi Party) met with such forceful opposition from the German churches, that Hitler decided to delay confrontation until the end of the war.<ref>[[Joachim Fest]]; ''Plotting Hitlers death:The German Resistance to Hitler 1933<U+2013>45''; Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1996 p.32</ref> The truce constituted a rare win of sorts for an opposition movement in Nazi Germany. The standoff fed the will of many German resistors, but the churches as institutions stopped short of ever offering a general resistance to Nazi rule.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

During the summer of 1938, wrote Hamerow, small groups of dissidents from the armed forces and civil service began to meet informally, the most prominent figure in these early days being [[Ludwig Beck]], the Army Chief of Staff, who began to contemplate a palace coup against Hitler.

In Rome, the Pope had continued to lobby world leaders for the avoidance of a conflict up until the very eve of war, and expressed his dismay that war had come in his October 1939 ''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'' encyclical.<ref name="britannica">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-236597 |title=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica's Reflections on the Holocaust |work=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-23}}</ref> With Poland overrun but France and the Low Countries yet to be attacked, Colonel [[Hans Oster]] of the Abwehr sent Munich lawyer and devout Catholic, [[Josef M<U+00FC>ller (CSU politician)|Josef M<U+00FC>ller]], on a clandestine trip to Rome to seek Papal assistance in the developing plot by the German military opposition to oust Hitler.<ref name="John Toland p.760">John Toland; ''Hitler''; Wordsworth Editions; 1997 Edn; p.760</ref> The Pope's Private Secretary, [[Robert Leiber]] acted at the intermediary between Pius and the Resistance.

The British agreed to negotiate, provided the Vatican could vouch for the opposition's representative. Pius, communicating with Britain's [[Francis d'Arcy Osborne]], channelled communications back and forth in secrecy.<ref name="Peter Hoffmann p.160"/> The Vatican agreed to send a letter outlining the bases for peace with England and the participation of the Pope was used to try to persuade senior German Generals Halder and Brauchitsch to act against Hitler.<ref name="John Toland p.760" />

Negotiations were tense, with a Western offensive expected, and on the basis that substantive negotiations could only follow the replacement of the Hitler regime. Hoffmann wrote that, when the [[Venlo Incident]] stalled the talks, the British agreed to resume discussions primarily because of the "efforts of the Pope and the respect in which he was held. Chamberlain and Halifax set great store by the Pope's readiness to mediate."<ref name="Peter Hoffmann p.160"/> Pius, without offering endorsement, advised Osbourne on 11 January 1940 that the German opposition had said that a German offensive was planned for February, but that this could be averted if the German generals could be assured of peace with Britain, and not on punitive terms. If this could be assured, then they were willing to move to replace Hitler. The Pope admitted to "discomfort" at his role as mediator, but advised that the Germans involved were not Nazis. The British government had doubts as to the capacity of the conspirators. On 7 February, the Pope updated Osbourne that the opposition wanted to replace the Nazi regime with a democratic federation, but hoped to retain Austria and the Sudetenland. The British government was non-committal, and said that while the federal model was of interest, the promises and sources of the opposition were to vague. Nevertheless, the resistance were encouraged by the talks, and Muller told Leiber that a coup would occur in February. Pius appeared to continue to hope for a coup in Germany into March 1940.<ref name="Peter Hoffmann p.160-163">Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933<U+2013>1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.&nbsp;160<U+2013>163</ref>

The negotiations ultimately proved fruitless. Hitler's swift victories over France and the Low Countries deflated the will of the German military to resist Hitler. Muller was arrested during the Nazis first raid on Military Intelligence in 1943. He spent the rest of the war in concentration camps, ending up at Dachau.<ref name="Weidenfeld p.131">[[Joachim Fest]]; Plotting Hitlers death:The German Resistance to Hitler 1933<U+2013>45; Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1996 p.131</ref>

}}

On 20 July 1944, an attempt was made to assassinate Adolf Hitler, inside his [[Wolf's Lair]] field headquarters in [[East Prussia]]. The plot was the culmination of the efforts of several groups in the German Resistance to overthrow the Nazi-led German government. The failure of both the assassination and the military ''coup d'<U+00E9>tat'' which was planned to follow it led to the arrest of at least 7,000 people by the [[Gestapo]].<ref name="shirer1393">Shirer 1960, p. 1393.</ref> According to records of the ''F<U+00FC>hrer Conferences on Naval Affairs'', 4,980 of these were executed.<ref name="shirer1393"/> During interrogations or their show trials a number of the conspirators cited the Nazi assault on the churches as one of the motivating factors for their involvement. The Protestant clergyman [[Eugen Gerstenmaier]] said that the key to the entire resistance flowed from Hitler's evil and the "Christian duty" to combat it.<ref>[[Joachim Fest]]; ''Plotting Hitlers death:The German Resistance to Hitler 1933<U+2013>45''; Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1996 p.326</ref>

The Bavarian Catholic Count [[Claus Von Stauffenberg]], had initially looked favourably on the arrival of the Nazis in power, but came to oppose the regime because of its persecution of the Jews and oppression of the church.<ref name="Graml, Mommsen p.231">Graml, Mommsen, Reichhardt & Wolf; The German Resistance to Hitler; B.

The planned Cabinet which was to replace the Nazi regime included Catholic politicians [[Eugen Bolz]], [[Bernhard Letterhaus]], [[Andreas Hermes]] and [[Josef Wirmer]].

==Catholic Resistance to the Holocaust==

The Catholic Church resisted the Holocaust by rejecting the racial ideology underpinning the mass exterminations; making certain public pronouncements against racial persecutions; and by lobbying officials, providing false documents, and hiding people in monasteries, convents, schools, among families and the institutions of the Vatican itself, leading many leading Jews to offer thanks to the Roman Church at the completion of the war.<ref name="yadvashem1">http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20684.pdf</ref> In every country under German occupation, priests played a major part in rescuing Jews.<ref>Martin Gilbert; ''The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust''; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p. 299</ref> Catholic historian [[Michael Phayer]] wrote that "''Rescuers and perpetrators were but a slight minority of Europe's Catholic population''."<ref name="Phayer" />

===Prelude to Holocaust===

On 11 November 1938, following ''[[Kristallnacht]]'', Pope Pius XI joined Western leaders in condemning the pogrom. In response, the Nazis organised mass demonstrations against Catholics and Jews in Munich, and the Bavarian Gauleiter [[Adolf Wagner]] declared before 5,000 protesters: "Every utterance the Pope makes in Rome is an incitement of the Jews throughout the world to agitate against Germany". Cardinal Faulhaber had supplied a truck to rabbi of the Ohel Yaakov synagogue, to rescue sacred objects before the building was torn down on Kristallacht. In retaliation, a Nazi mob attacked Faulhaber's palace, and smashed its windows.<ref name="MartinGilbert" /> On 21 November, in an address to the world's Catholics, the Pope rejected the Nazi claim of racial superiority, and insisted instead that there was only a single human race. [[Robert Ley]], the Nazi Minister of Labour declared the following day in Vienna: "No compassion will be tolerated for the Jews. We deny the Pope's statement that there is but one human race. The Jews are parasites." Catholic leaders including Cardinal Schuster of Milan, Cardinal van Roey in Belgium and Cardinal Verdier in Paris backed the Pope's strong condemnation of Kristallnacht.<ref name="MartinGilbert_a">Martin Gilbert; ''Kristallnacht - Prelude to Disaster''; HarperPress; 2006; p.172</ref> At his Berlin Cathedral, Fr. [[Bernhard Lichtenberg]] closed each evening service with a prayer "for the Jews, and the poor prisoners in the Concentration camps".<ref>Martin Gilbert; ''Kristallnacht - Prelude to Disaster''; HarperPress; 2006; p.40</ref>

From 1934, forced sterilisation of the hereditarily diseased had commenced in Germany. Based on [[eugenics|eugenic]] theories, it proposed to cleanse the German nation of "unhealthy breeding stock" and was taken a step further in 1939, when the regime commenced its "euthanasia". This was the first of the regime's infamous series of mass extermination programmes, which saw the Nazis attempt to eliminate "life unworthy of life" from Europe: first the handicapped, then Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, and others deemed "subnormal". Ultimately, the Jews suffered most in numerical terms, while Gypsies suffered the greatest proportional loss. The Jews later termed the tragedy [[The Holocaust]] (or ''Shoah'').<ref>Mary Fulbrook; The Fontana History of Germany: 1918<U+2013>1990 The Divided Nation; Fontana Press; 1991; pp.&nbsp;104<U+2013>5</ref>

Hitler's order for the T4 Euthanasia Program was dated 1 September, the day Germany invaded Poland. As word of the program spread, protest grew, until finally, Bishop August von Galen delivered his famous 1941 sermons denouncing the program as "murder". Thousands of copies of the sermons were circulated across Germany. Galen denounced the regime's violations of basic human rights: "the right to life , to inviolability, and to freedom is an indispensable part of any moral social order", he said - and any government that punishes without court proceedings "undermines its own authority and respect for its sovereignty  within the conscience of its citizens".<ref name="Theodore S. Hamerow p. 289-90"/> On 3 August 1941, in one of his series of denunciations, Galen declared:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=8064 |title=Library : The Bishop vs. the Nazis: Bl. Clemens von Galen in World War II Germany |publisher=Catholic Culture |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref>

{{quotation|"Thou shalt not kill." God engraved this commandment on the souls of men long before any penal code&nbsp;... God has engraved these [[Ten Commandments|commandments]] in our hearts&nbsp;... They are the unchangeable and fundamental truths of our social life&nbsp;...

As for the first commandment, "Thou shalt not have strange gods before me," instead of the One, True, Eternal God, men have created at the dictates of their whim, their own gods to adore: Nature, the State, the Nation, or the Race.}}

The words had profound resonance for the mass extermination programs yet to come, and forced the euthanasia program underground. Unlike the Nazi euthanasia murder of invalids, which the church led protests against, the ''[[Final Solution]]'' liquidation of the Jews did not primarily take place on German soil, but rather in Polish territory. Awareness of the murderous campaign was therefore less widespread.<ref name="Peter Hoffmann p.24"/> Such protests as were made by the Catholic bishops in Germany regarding anti-Semitic policies of the regime, tended to be by way of private letters to government ministers.<ref name="Ian Kershaw pp210-11" /> But the Church had already rejected the racial ideology underpinning the Nazi Holocaust.

The [[Nazi Concentration Camps]] had been established in 1933, as political prisons, but it was not until the invasion of Russia that the death camps opened, and techniques learned in the aborted euthanasia program were transported to the East for the racial exterminations. The process of gassing commenced in December 1941.<ref>Mary Fulbrook; The Fontana History of Germany: 1918<U+2013>1990 The Divided Nation; Fontana Press; 1991; pp.&nbsp;104<U+2013>110</ref> During the pontificate of [[Pope John Paul II]], the Catholic Church reflected on the Holocaust in ''[[We Remember: A Reflection on the Shoah]]'' (1998).

; 1942 Christmas address

After the invasion of the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany commenced its industrialised mass murder of the Jews, around late 1941/early 1942. Pius XII employed diplomacy to aid the victims of the Holocaust, and directed his Church to provide discreet aid to Jews.<ref name="britannica1"/> At Christmas 1942, once evidence of the mass slaughter of the Jews had emerged, Pius XII [[Pope Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address|voiced concern]] at the murder of "hundreds of thousands" of "faultless" people because of their "nationality or race" and intervened to attempt to block Nazi deportations of Jews in various countries. According to the Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica, he refused to say more "fearing that public papal denunciations might provoke the Hitler regime to brutalize further those subject to Nazi terror <U+2014> as it had when Dutch bishops publicly protested earlier in the year<U+2014>while jeopardizing the future of the church".<ref name="britannica4">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-236597 |title=Pius XII - World War II and the Holocaust |work=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref> Regardless, the Nazi authorities were distressed by the papal intervention.

; Diplomatic activities

Pius XII allowed the national hierarchies of the Church to assess and respond to their local situation under Nazi rule, but himself established the Vatican Information Service to provide aid to, and information about, war refugees.<ref name="britannica4"/> He gave his blessing to the establishment of safe houses inside the Vatican and in monasteries and convents across Europe and oversaw a secret operation for priests to shelter Jews by means of fake documents - with some Jews made Vatican subjects to spare them from the Nazis.

;Italy

In Italy, where the Pope's direct influence was strongest, the Pope ordered Catholic institutions to open themselves to the Jews, when the Nazi roundups finally came to the country, following Fascist Italy's capitulation. Anti-Semitism had not been a founding principle of Italian Fascism, although Mussolini's regime moved closer to Hitler with time. On 27 June 1943, [[Vatican Radio]] is reported to have broadcast a papal injunction: "He who makes a distinction between Jews and other men is being unfaithful to God and is in conflict with God's commands".<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p.311</ref> In July 1943, with the Allies advancing from the south, Mussolini was overthrown, and on 1 September, the new government agreed an armistice with the Allies.<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p.313</ref> The Germans occupied much of the country, commencing an effort to deport the nation's Jews.<ref>[http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/stories/historical_background/italy.asp Italy Historical Background]; [[Yad Vashem]]; retrieved 1 September 2013</ref> The Pope had helped the Jews of Rome in September, by offering whatever amounts of gold might be needed towards the 50&nbsp;kg ransom demanded by the Nazis. According to [[Martin Gilbert]], when the Nazis commenced the roundup of Roman Jews of 16 October, Pius had already "A few days earlier&nbsp;... personally ordered the Vatican clergy to open the sanctuaries of the Vatican City to all "non-Aryans" in need of refuge. By morning of October 16, a total of 477 Jews had been given shelter in the Vatican and its enclaves, while another 4,238 had been given sanctuary in the many monasteries and convents of in Rome. Only 1,015 of Rome's 6,730 Jews were seized that morning".<ref>[[Martin Gilbert]]; ''The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy''; Collins; London; 1986; pp.&nbsp;622<U+2013>623</ref> Upon receiving news of the roundups on the morning of 16 October, the Pope immediately instructed Cardinal Secretary of State, Cardinal Maglione, to make a protest to the German ambassador to the Vatican, [[Ernst von Weizsacker]]: "Maglione did so that morning, making it clear to the ambassador that the deportation of Jews was offensive to the Pope. In urging Weizsacker 'to try to save these innocent people,' Maglione added: 'It is sad for the Holy Father, sad beyond imagination, that here in Rome, under the very eyes of the Common Father, that so many people should suffer only because they belong to a specific race.'" Following the meeting, Weizsacker gave orders for a halt to the arrests.<ref name="spectator.org" /> As German round-ups continued in Northern Italy, the Pope opened his summer residence, [[Castel Gandolfo]], to take in thousands of Jews and authorised institutions across the north to do the same.<ref name="spectator.org"/>

; Hungary

Pius made a direct intervention in Hungary to lobby for an end to Jewish deportations in 1944, and on July 4, the Hungarian leader, [[Admiral Horthy]], told Berlin's representative that deportations of Jews must cease, citing protests by the Vatican, the King of Sweden and the Red Cross for his decision.<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p.335</ref> The pro-Nazi, anti-Semitic [[Arrow Cross]] seized power in October, and a campaign of murder of the Jews commenced. The neutral powers led a major rescue effort and Pius' representative, Angelo Rotta took the lead in establishing an "international Ghetto", around which the Swiss, Swedish, Portuguese, Spanish and Vatican legations affixed their emblems, providing shelter for some 25,000 Jews.<ref>[[Martin Gilbert]]; ''The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust''; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p.337</ref>

; Assessments of Pius XII

Upon the death of Pius XII in 1958, the Israeli Foreign Minister [[Golda Meir]] said: "When fearful martyrdom came to our people in the decade of Nazi terror, the voice of the Pope was raised for the victims. The life of our times was enriched by a voice speaking out on the great moral truths above the tumult of daily conflict. We mourn a great servant of peace."<ref name="spectator.org"/> Leading historian of the Holocaust, Sir [[Martin Gilbert]], has  said that Pope Pius XII should be declared a "righteous gentile" by Yad Vashem.<ref>{{cite news|last=Coppen |first=Luke |url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2010/07/07/pius-xii-%E2%80%98secured-visas-for-jews%E2%80%99-after-kristallnacht/ |title=Pius XII 'secured visas for Jews' after Kristallnacht |publisher=Catholic Herald |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref> But his insistence on Vatican neutrality and avoidance of naming the Nazis as the evildoers of the conflict became the foundation for contemporary and later criticisms from some quarters.<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica: ''Roman Catholicism - the period of the world wars.</ref> Hitler biographer John Toland, while scathing of Pius' cautious public comments in relation to the mistreatment of Jews, concluded that nevertheless, "The Church, under the Pope's guidance, had already saved the lives of more Jews than all other churches, religious institutions and rescue organizations combined&nbsp;...".<ref name="John Toland p.760"/> Assessing Pius' role as a protector of Jews during the war, David Klinghoffer wrote for the Jewish Journal in 2005 that "I'm not sure it's true, as [[David G. Dalin|Dalin]] argues, that Pius saved more Jews than any other Righteous Gentile in World War II. But it seems fairly certain that he was, overall, a strenuous defender of Jews who saved tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands.

[[Susan Zuccotti]] has written that the Vatican was aware of the creation of the Nazi extermination camps, and that she believed that with an "open condemnation of racism and the persecutions (of Jews)" by the Church, "other results could have been achieved."

====Vatican diplomats====

Vatican neutrality through the war permitted the Holy See's network of diplomats to continue to operate throughout the occupied territories of the Nazi Empire, enabling the dissemination of intelligence back to Rome, and diplomatic interventions on behalf of the victims of the conflict.

[[Eugenio Pacelli]] (later Pope Pius XII) served as [[Pius XI]]'s diplomatic representative in Germany (1917<U+2013>1929) and then as Vatican Secretary of State (1929<U+2013>1939), during which period he delivered multiple denunciations of Nazi racial ideology. As Secretary of State, Pacelli made some 55 protests against Nazi policies, including its "ideology of race".<ref name="spectator.org" /> As the newly installed Nazi Government began to instigate its program of anti-antisemitism, Pope Pius XI, through Cardinal Pacelli, who was by then serving as Vatican Secretary of State, ordered the successor Papal Nuncio in Berlin, [[Cesare Orsenigo]], to "look into whether and how it may be possible to become involved" in their aid. Orsenigo generally proved a poor instrument in this regard, concerned more with the anti-church policies of the Nazis and how these might effect German Catholics, than with taking action to help German Jews.<ref>Paul O'Shea; A Cross Too Heavy; Rosenberg Publishing; p. 232 ISBN 978-1-877058-71-4</ref> In the assessment of historian [[Michael Phayer]], Orsenigo did intervene on behalf of the Jews, but only seldom, and apart from his attempt to halt a plan to "resettle" Jews married to Christians, when directed by the Holy See to protest against mistreatment of Jews, he did so "timidly".<ref>Michael Phayer; ''The Catholic Church and the Holocaust 1930<U+2013>1965; Indiana University Press; 2000; p.45</ref>

The 1937 papal anti-Nazi encyclical ''Mit brennender Sorge'' was part drafted by Pacelli as Vatican Secretary of State. It repudiated Nazi racial theory and the "so-called myth of race and blood".<ref name="vatican2"/> Pacelli became Pope in 1939, and told Vatican officials that he intended to reserve the all important handling of diplomacy with Germany for himself.<ref>Michael Phayer; ''The Catholic Church and the Holocaust 1930<U+2013>1965; Indiana University Press; 2000; p.44</ref> He issued ''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'' with spoke of the equality of races, and of Jew and Gentile. Following a 21 June 1943 Vatican Radio broadcast to Germany which spoke in defence of Yugoslav Jews, Pius XII instructed the papal nuncio to Germany, Cesare Orsenigo to speak directly with Hitler about the persecution of the Jews. Orsenigo later met with Hitler at Berchtesgaden, but when the subject of the Jews was raised, Hitler reportedly turned his back, and smashed a glass on the floor.<ref>[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=1438&CFID=14594334&CFTOKEN=66641408 The Record of Pius XII's Opposition to Hitler]; by ''Inside the Vatican Staff''; published at CatholicCulture.Org; retrieved 16 October 2013</ref>

;Vichy France

With the Nazi Empire around its full extent in late 1942, the Nazis sought to extend their roundups of Jews, and resistance began to spread. In Lyon, [[Cardinal Gerlier]] had defiantly refused to hand over Jewish children being sheltered in Catholic homes, and on 9 September, it was reported in London that Vichy French authorities had ordered the arrest of all Catholic priests sheltering Jews in the unoccupied zone. Eight Jesuits were arrested for sheltering hundreds of children on Jesuit properties, and Pius XII's Secretary of State, Cardinal Maglione informed the Vichy Ambassador to the Vatican that "the conduct of the Vichy government towards Jews and foreign refugees was a gross infraction" of the Vichy government's own principles, and "irreconcilable with the religious feelings which Marshal Petain had so often invoked in his speeches".<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy; Collins; London; 1986; p.451</ref>

; Croatia

After the 1941 invasion of Yugoslavia, [[Independent State of Croatia|a puppet state was created in Croatia]]. In Italian-occupied Croatia, Nazi envoy [[Siegfried Kasche]] advised Berlin that Italian forces were not willing to hand over Jews and had "apparently been influenced" by Vatican opposition to German anti-Semitism, and no Jews were deported from Italy prior to the 1943 Nazi occupation.<ref name="Martin Gilbert p.466">Martin Gilbert; The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy; Collins; London; 1986; p.466</ref>

In Croatia, the Vatican used a Benedictine abbot, [[Giuseppe Marcone]], as its apostolic visitor - together with Archbishop [[Aloysius Stepinac]] of Zagreb - to pressure the [[Ante Paveli<U+0107>|Paveli<U+0107>]] regime to cease its facilitation of race murders.<ref name="Phayer p85">Phayer p85</ref> In the Spring of 1942, following a meeting with Pius XII in Rome, Stepinac declared publicly that it was "forbidden to exterminate Gypsies and Jews because they are said to belong to an inferior race".<ref name="autogenerated38">Michael Phayer; ''The Catholic Church and the Holocaust 1930<U+2013>1965; Indiana University Press; 2000; p.38</ref> In July and October 1943, Stepinac denounced race murders in the most explicit terms, and had his denunciation read from pulpits across Croatia.<ref>Michael Phayer; ''The Catholic Church and the Holocaust 1930<U+2013>1965; Indiana University Press; 2000; p.46</ref> [[Martin Gilbert]] wrote that "In the Croatian capital of Zagreb, as a result of intervention by [Marcone] on behalf of Jewish partners in mixed marriages, a thousand Croat Jews survived the war", while "Stepinac, who in 1941 had welcomed Croat independence, subsequently condemned Croat atrocities against both Serbs and Jews, and himself saved a group of Jews in an old age home".<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p.203</ref>

The Apostolic delegate to Turkey, [[Angelo Roncalli]], saved a number of Croatian Jews - as well as Bulgarian and Hungarian Jews - by assisting their migration to Palestine.

Bulgaria signed a pact with Hitler in 1941 and reluctantly joined the Axis powers. Mgr [[Angelo Roncalli]] - then Papal Nuncio in Turkey, later Pope John XXIII - was among those who lobbied [[Boris III of Bulgaria|King Boris]] for the protection of Jewish families. The King effectively thwarted Hitler's plans for the extermination of Bulgaria's Jews, and at war's end, Bulgaria had a larger Jewish population than it had had at the outset.<ref name="catholicherald1"/>

In 1943, Pius instructed his Bulgarian representative to take "all necessary steps" to support Bulgarian Jews facing deportation and his Turkish nuncio, [[Angelo Roncalli]] arranged for the transfer of thousands of children out of Bulgaria to Palestine.<ref name="spectator.org"/> The [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] lobbied firmly against the deportations of Jews, and in March 1943, the King rescinded the order to deport them, and released Jews already in custody - an event known in Bulgaria as the "miracle of the Jewish people".<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p.&nbsp;212<U+2013>214</ref>

According to Gilbert, "With [[Arrow Cross]] members killing Jews in the streets of Budapest, Angelo Rotta, the senior Vatican representative in Budapest, took a lead in establishing an "International Ghetto", consisting of several dozen modern apartment buildings to which large numbers of Jews - eventually 25,000 - were brought and to which the Swiss, Swedish, Portuguese, and Spanish legations, as well as the Vatican, affixed their emblems."<ref name="Martin Gilbert p337">Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p337</ref> Rotta also got permission from the Vatican to begin issuing protective passes to Jewish converts - and was eventually able to distribute more than 15,000 such protective passes, while instructing the drafters of the documents not to examine the recipients credentials too closely.<ref name="Martin Gilbert p341">Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p341</ref> A Red Cross official asked Rotta for pre-signed blank identity papers, to offer to the sick and needy fleeing the Arrow Cross, and was given the documents, along with Rotta's blessing.<ref name="Martin Gilbert p344">Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p344</ref> Rotta encouraged Hungarian church leaders to help their "Jewish brothers", and directed Fr [[Tibor Baranszky]] to go to the forced marches and distribute letters of immunity to as many Jews as he could.<ref name="Martin Gilbert p341"/> Baranszky, was executive secretary of the Jewish Protection Movement of the Holy See in Hungary, and was also honoured by Yad Vashem as a Righteous Gentil for saving over 3,000 Jewish lives, acting on the orders of Pope Pius XII.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/vnews/getstory.asp?number=30167 |title=A "Righteous Gentile" Defends Pius Xii |work=EWTN.com |date=2002-10-06 |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref>

On 15 November, the Hungarian Government established the "Big Ghetto" for 69,000, while a further 30,000 with protective documents went to the International Ghetto.<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p.341</ref> On 19 November 1944, the Vatican joined the four other neutral powers - Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Switzerland - in a further collective protest to the Hungarian Government calling for the suspension of deportations.<ref name="Martin Gilbert p344"/> The government complied, and banned the "death marches" - but Budapest was by that stage near anarchy, and deportations continued from 21 November. The Arrow Cross continued their orgy of violence, raiding the international Ghetto and murdering Jews, as Soviet forces approached the city. Rotta and Wallenberg were among the few diplomats to remain in Budapest. Following the Soviet conquest of the city, Wallenberg was seized by the Russians and taken to Moscow, from where he was never released. Gilbert wrote that of the hundred and fifty thousand Jews who had been in Budapest when the Germans arrived in March 1944, almost 120,000 survived to liberation - 69,000 from the Big Ghetto, 25,000 in the International Ghetto and a further 25,000 hiding out in Christian homes and religious institutes across the city.<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p&nbsp;347<U+2013>350</ref>

===Episcopal protests===

Various bishops protested the Nazi mistreatment of Jews. On July 11, 1942, the Dutch bishops, joined all Christian denominations in sending a letter to the Nazi General [[Friedrich Christiansen]] in protest against the treatment of Jews. The letter was read in all Catholic churches against German opposition. It brought attention to mistreatment of Jews and asked all Christians to pray for them:<ref name="ncregister.com">{{cite news|last=Lehner |first=Ulrich L. |url=http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/the_bishops_who_defied_the_nazis/ |title=The Bishops Who Defied the Nazis |publisher=[[National Catholic Register]] |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref>

When round-ups of foreign Jews in France first commenced, the French Catholic bishops, and the leading representative of French Jewry alike, took little action. The largely conservative French hierarchy was initially broadly sympathetic to the Vichy Government.<ref name="Richard_b">Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; Penguin Press; New York 2009, p.380</ref> A meeting of the Cardinals and Bishops of 21 July 1942, resulted in a letter to Marshall Petain calling only asking for better treatment of internees. But when the authorities began to round-up French Jews, attitudes changed. And when the Nazis pressured the Vichy Regime to reclassify French Jews as "foreigners", the bishops declared their opposition.<ref name="Richard_b" />

Bishops began to speak out and some encouraged secret rescue efforts of Jews, especially of Jewish children.<ref name="Richard_b" /> With the free press silenced, Charles Lederman, a Jewish Communist approached the [[Archbishop of Toulouse]], [[Jules-G<U+00E9>raud Sali<U+00E8>ge]], to alert public opinion to what was being done to the Jews. He told Sali<U+00E8>ge of the arrests, kidnappings and deportations.<ref name="yadvashem3">[http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%204805.pdf Jewish Rescue Operations in Belgium and France]; by [[Lucien Steinberg]]; published by [[Yad Vashem]]</ref> On 30 August 1942, Sali<U+00E8>ge wrote a famous pastoral letter, declaring that Jews were humans, who should not be loaded on trucks like cattle.<ref name="Richard_b" /> He told his parishioners: "The Jews are real men and women. Not everything is permitted against these men and women, against these fathers and mothers. They are part of the human species. They are our brothers like so many others. A Christian should not forget this".

In Croatia, in the Spring of 1942, Archbishop [[Aloysius Stepinac]] of Zagreb, following a meeting with Pius XII in Rome, declared publicly that it was "forbidden to exterminate Gypsies and Jews because they are said to belong to an inferior race".<ref name="autogenerated38"/>  When Himmler visited Zagreb a year later, indicating the impending roundup of remaining Jews, Stepinac wrote Paveli<U+0107> that if this occurred, he would protest for "the Catholic Church is not afraid of any secular power, whatever it may be, when it has to protect basic human values". When deportatation began, Stepinac and Marcone protested to [[Andrija Artukovic]].<ref name="Michael Phayer p85"/> According to Phayer, the Vatican ordered Stepinac to save as many Jews as possible during the upcoming roundup.<ref name="Michael Phayer p86"/> In July and October 1943, Stepinac condemned race murders in the most explicit terms, and had his condemnation read from pulpits across Croatia. The Germans took this to be a denunciation of the murder of both Serbs and Jews, and arrested 31 priests. Phayer wrote that, despite knowing that he would be a target of Communists if the Croat regime fell, "no leader of a national church ever spoke as pointedly about genocide as did Spepinac".<ref>Michael Phayer; ''The Catholic Church and the Holocaust 1930<U+2013>1965; Indiana University Press; 2000; p.47</ref> Though Stepinac personally saved many potential victims, his protests had little effect on Paveli<U+0107>.<ref name="Phayer p85"/>

During the [[History of the Netherlands (1939<U+2013>1945)|Nazi Occupation of the Netherlands]], when Jewish deportations began, many were hidden in Catholic areas. Parish priests created networks for hiding Jews and close knit country parishes were able to hide Jews without being informed upon by neighbours, as occurred in the cities.<ref name="yadvashem5">http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/pdf/resources/michman_holland.pdf</ref> Gilbert wrote, "as in every country under German occupation, so in Holland, local priests played a major part in rescuing Jews".<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p.299</ref>

[[Cardinal van Roey]], the head of the Catholic Church in Belgium intervened with the authorities to rescue Jews, and encouraged various institutions to aid Jewish children. One of his acts of rescue was to open a geriatric centre in which Jews were housed, at which kosher Jewish cooks would be required who could therefore be given special passes protecting them from deportation.<ref name="MartinGilbert_b" />

Many Belgian convents and monasteries sheltered Jewish children, pretending that they were Christian - among them the Franciscan Sisters in Bruges, the Sisters of Don Bosco in Courtrai, the Sisters of St Mary near Brussels, the Dominican Sisters at Lubbeek and others. Fr [[Joseph Andre]] of Namur found shelter for around 100 children in convents, returning them to Jewish community leaders after the war. Andre was very active in the rescue of Jews, handing over his own bed to Jewish refugees, and finding families to hide them, and distributing food as well as communications between families. He is credit with saving some 200 lives, and was forced into hiding in the final stages of the war.<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p.265</ref>

The Benedictine monk, [[Henri Reynders|Dom Bruno]] (Henri Reynders), was active with the [[Belgian Resistance]] and organised escape routes for downed allied pilots and for Belgian Jews. Jews were hidden in monasteries, schools and the homes of Catholics at Dom Bruno's request. He was declared [[Righteous Among the Nations]] by Israel in 1964.<ref name="catholicnewsagency">{{cite news|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/column.php?n=1670 |title=The Belgian Catholic Church: Resistance to the Nazis - By Harry Schnitker, Ph.D |publisher=Catholic News Agency |date=2011-11-21 |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref> He is credited with finding refuge for 320 Jewish children, and developed a disdain for Nazi anti-Semitism when exposed to it on a 1938 visit to Germany.

The Belgian Resistance viewed the defence of Jews as a central part of its activities. The [[Comit<U+00E9> de D<U+00E9>fense des Juifs]] (CDJ) was formed to work for the defence of Jews in the summer of 1942, and of its eight founding members, seven were Jewish and one, [[Emile Hambresin]] was Catholic. Some of their rescue operations were overseen by the priests [[Joseph Andr<U+00E9>]] and Dom Bruno. Among other institutions, the CDJ enlisted the help of monasteries and religious schools and hospitals. [[Yvonne N<U+00E8>vejean]] of the Oeuvre Nationale de l'Enfance greatly assisted with the hiding of Jewish children.<ref name="yadvashem3"/> According to Gilbert, over four and a half thousands Jewish children were given refuge in Christian families, convents, boarding schools, orphanages and sanatoriums because of the efforts of N<U+00E8>vejean.

[[Elisabeth of Bavaria, Queen of Belgium|The Queen Mother Elizabeth]] and [[:fr:L<U+00E9>on Platteau|L<U+00E9>on Platteau]] of the Interior Ministry also made a stance to protect Jews.<ref>http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%205956.pdf</ref>

Fr. [[Hubert C<U+00E9>lis]] of Halmaal was arrested for harbouring Jewish children, but was released after confronting his interrogator with the following words: "You are a Catholic, and have forgotten that the Virgin was a Jewess, that Christ was Jewish, that He commanded us to love and help one another&nbsp;...

The Hungarian Regent, [[Admiral Horthy]], though allied to Hitler, did not adopt Nazi racial ideology, and Hungarian Jews were not subject to deportations to death camps through 1942-3.<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p&nbsp;329<U+2013>30</ref> The Nazis occupied Hungary in 1944, and commenced widescale deportations of Jews.<ref name="Michael Phayer p.117"/> The process began in with Jews sent to Ghettos, and though local leaders of the Catholic, Protestant Reform Churches tried to help the Jews, Jews from all across Hungary outside of Budapest were deported to Auschwitz.<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p330</ref>

As rumour spread of the murder of the deportees, the Hungarian Ministry for the Interior criticised clergymen for issuing fake baptismal certificates. On June 26, 1944, confirmation of the mass murder at Auschwitz spurred the neutral powers in Budapest - including the Vatican - into action, and sought to thwart Nazi efforts to exterminate the Jews, by issuing protective visas. The virulently anti-Semitic [[Arrow Cross]] seized power in October, and the murderous campaign against the Jews was re-opened. Papal Nunico [[Angelo Rotta]] lead the neutral diplomats in establishing an "international Ghetto" under their protection.<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p&nbsp;32333<U+2013>336</ref> Rotta also encouraged Hungarian church leaders to help their "Jewish brothers", and directed Fr [[Tibor Baranszky]] to go to the forced marches and distribute letters of immunity to as many Jews as he could.<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p41</ref>

Local church men and women were also prominent in rescue efforts. Jesuit Prior Jakab Raile is credited with saving arounf 150 in the Jesuit residence of the city.<ref name="Martin Gilbert p337"/> [[Margit Slachta]] of the [[Sisters of Social Service|Hungarian Social Service Sisterhood]], told her sisters that the precepts of their faith demanded that they protect the Jews, even if it lead to their own deaths. Slachta responded immediately to reports in 1940 of early displacement of Jews. When in 1941, 20,000 Jewish labourers were deported, Slachta protested to the wife of Admiral Horthy. Following the Nazi occupation, Slachta's sisters arranged baptisms in the hope it would spare people from deportation, sent food and supplies to the Jewish ghettos, and sheltered people in their convents.<ref name="Michael Phayer p.117"/>  One of Slachta's sisters, The Blessed [[S<U+00E1>ra Salkah<U+00E1>zi]], was among those captured sheltering the Jews, and executed.<ref name="foxnews.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/09/17/hungarian-nun-who-saved-jews-in-world-war-ii-beatified/ |title=Hungarian Nun Who Saved Jews in World War II Beatified |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date= 17 September 2006|accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref> Slachta herself was beaten and only narrowly avoided execution.

In his study of the rescuers of the Jews, Martin Gilbert recounts that the monks of the Champagnat Institute of the Order of Mary in Budapest took in 100 children and 50 parents as boarders. Discovered, the Jews were killed, and six monks tortured, but released.<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p.338</ref> Similar numbers were protected and then discovered in the convents of the Sisters of the Divine Saviour and the Order of the Divine Love, with many of the Jews dragged out and murdered by the Arrow Cross.<ref name="Martin Gilbert p338">Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p338</ref>  The prioress of the Sisters of the Eucharistic Union was captured and tortured for sheltering Jews in her hospital. Despite warnings, she resumed her rescue efforts in the apartment of the Prelate Arnold Pataky.<ref name="Martin Gilbert p338"/> Hundreds more Jews were saved at the Convent of the Good Shepherd, the home of the Sisters of Mercyof Szatmar and the Convent of Sacre Couer.<ref name="Martin Gilbert p338"/>

;Baltic States

In Lithuania, priests were active in the rescue of Jews, among them Fr Dambrauskas of Alsedziai (who acted against the wishes of his bishop), the Jesuit Bronius Paukstis, Fr Lapis from Siauliai and Fr Jonas Gylys of Varena, who delivered sermons against the killing of Jews, and sought to comfort Jews marked for murder.<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p.75</ref>

In Scandinavia, the Catholic presence was small, but here the Christian Churches firmly opposed the deportations of Jews - [[Church of Norway]] bishops gave stern warnings, and the [[Church of Denmark|Danish Churches]] published strong protests and urged their congregations to assist Jews.

The Jews of Warsaw, who prior to the war numbered some half a million people, were forced into the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] in 1940. By November 1941, the Nazi governor of the city had decreed that the death penalty would be applied with utmost severity to those sheltering or aiding Jews in any way.<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; pp.&nbsp;110<U+2013>111</ref> [[Matylda Getter]], mother superior of the [[Franciscan Sisters of the Family of Mary]] took the decision to offer shelter to any Jewish children who could escape the Ghetto.<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p.114</ref> Getter's convent was located at the entrance to the Ghetto. When the Nazis commenced the clearing of the Ghetto in 1941, Getter took in many orphans and dispersed them among Family of Mary homes. As the Nazis began sending orphans to the gas chambers, Getter issued fake baptismal certificates, providing the children with false identities. Living in daily fear of the Germans, the Family of Mary rescued more than 750 Jews.<ref name="Michael Phayer p.117">Michael Phayer; The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930<U+2013>1965; Indiana University Press; p.117-</ref>

When [[Armia Krajowa|AK]] Home Army Intelligence discovered the true fate of transports leaving the Jewish Ghetto, the Council to Aid Jews - ''Rada Pomocy <U+017B>ydom'' (codename ''[[Zegota]]'') was established in late 1942, in co-operation with church groups. The organisation saved thousands. Emphasis was placed on protecting children, as it was near impossible to intervene directly against the heavily guarded transports. False papers were prepared, and children were distributed among safe houses and church networks.<ref>Norman Davies; ''Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw''; Vikiing; 2003; p.200</ref> Jewish children were often placed in church orphanages and convents.<ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Zegota.html |title=<U+017B>egota (1942<U+2013>1945) |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |date=1977-02-26 |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref> Poland was the only country in occupied Europe where such an organisation was established.<ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/> Zegota was instigated by the writer Zofia Kossak-Szczucka and Catholic democrat activists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/related_sites.asp |title=The Righteous Among The Nations |publisher=Yad Vashem |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref> Two women founded the movement, the Catholic writer and activist, [[Zofia Kossak-Szczucka]], and the socialist [[Wanda Filipowicz]].

====France====

Many French clergy and religious have been honoured by [[Yad Vashem]], and, wrote Gilbert "Many priests and nuns, and Catholic institutions throughout France did what they could to save Jews from deportation".<ref name="Martin Gilbert p.248">Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p.248</ref> The first deportation of Jews from Paris occurred on 27 March 1942. Mostly Polish-born, they were taken to Auschwitz. Deportations continued through the following months, and intensified in August. Gilbert wrote that, "Senior church figures took a leading role: just south of Lyons, Protestant and Catholic clerics, including [[Cardinal Gerlier]], the Archbishop of Lyons, joined forces with Jewish resistance groups to ding hiding places for five hundred adults and more than a hundred children&nbsp;... Not only Cardinal Gerlier, but also his Secretary, Monsieigneur [[Jean-Baptiste Maury]]&nbsp;... were honoured [by Yad Vashem] for their acts of rescue."<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p.224</ref> Thousands of priests, monks, nuns, and lay people performed acts of charity toward the persecuted Jews of France.<ref name="yadvashem4"/> On 28 August 1942, the Germans ordered the arrest of all Catholic priests sheltering Jews.<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p.225</ref>

[[The Times]] reported that Cardinal Gerlier had defiantly refused to surrender Jewish children being sheltered in Catholic homes, and that multiple arrests had been made, including of Jesuits who had been sheltering hundreds of children. The Vatican denounced the treatment of Jews in France to the Vichy French ambassador to the Holy See.<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p.&nbsp;226<U+2013>7</ref> Monsignor [[Gabriel Piguet]], the [[Bishop of Clermont-Ferrand]], allowed Jewish children to be hidden from the Nazis at the Saint Marguerite Catholic boarding school in Clermont-Ferrand and was arrested in his Cathedral on 28 May 1944.

Two thirds of the 300,000 Jews living in France at the outbreak of war survived the Nazi holocaust.<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p.251</ref> Thousands of priests, nuns and lay people acted to assist French Jews.

Despite the Italian Dictator's Mussolini's close alliance with Hitler's Germany, Italy did not adopt Nazism's genocidal ideology towards the Jews. The Nazis were frustrated by the Italian forces refusal to co-operate in the round ups of Jews, and no Jews were deported from Italy prior to the Nazi occupation of the country following the Italian capitulation in 1943.<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p.&nbsp;307<U+2013>8</ref> In Italian occupied Croatia, Nazi envoy [[Siegfried Kasche]] advised Berlin that Italian forces had "apparently been influenced" by Vatican opposition to German anti-Semitism.<ref name="Martin Gilbert p.466"/> As anti-Axis feeling grew in Italy, the use of [[Vatican Radio]] to broadcast papal disapproval of race murder and anti-Semitism angered the Nazis.<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ISBN 0-385-60100-X; p.308 & 311</ref> Mussolini was overthrown in July 1943, and the Nazi moved to occupy Italy, and commenced a round-up of Jews. Though thousands were caught, the great majority of Italy's Jews were saved. As in other nations, Catholic networks were heavily engaged in rescue efforts.

[[File:Assisi San Rufino BW 5.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Assisi Cathedral]]. The Bishop of Assisi established the [[Assisi Network]], in which the churches, monasteries and convents of [[Assisi]] served as a safe haven for several hundred Jews during the German occupation.]]

According to [[Martin Gilbert]], the Pope had helped the Jews of Rome in September 1943, by offering whatever amounts of gold might be needed towards the 50&nbsp;kg ransom demanded by the Nazis. At the same time, wrote Gilbert, the Capuchin [[P<U+00E8>re Marie-Beno<U+00EE>t|Father Benoit]] had saved large numbers of Jews by providing them with false identification papers, helped by the Swiss, Hungarian, Rumanian and French embassies, and a number of Italian officials. A few days before the October 15/16 roundup, Pius XII personally directed Vatican clergy to open the sanctuaries of the Vatican to all "non-Aryans" in need of refuge.<ref>Martin Gilbert; The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy; Collins; London; 1986; pp.&nbsp;622<U+2013>623</ref> 4715 of the 5715 Roman Jews listed for deportation by the Nazis were sheltered in 150 institutions - 477 in the Vatican itself. As German round-ups continued in Northern Italy, the Pope opened his summer residence, [[Castel Gandolfo]], to take in thousands of Jews and authorised institutions across the north to do the same.<ref name="spectator.org"/>

From his Vatican office, and in co-operation with Pius XII,<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/> Monsignor [[Hugh O'Flaherty]], an Irishman, operated an escape operation for Jews and Allied escapees. The [[Irish Independent]] credited him with having saved more than 6,500 people during the war.<ref name="independent.ie" /> From 1943, he began to offer shelter to allied servicemen seeking sanctuary in the Vatican. Using fake documents and a clandestine communications network, O'Flaherty defied the Gestapo's war criminal commander of Rome, [[Herbert Kappler]], and evaded capture through the German occupation of Rome. O'Flaherty's '"Rome Escape Line" hid British and American soldiers and Jews in safe houses around the city.<ref name="independent.ie"/>  Kappler had a white line drawn around the boundary of the Vatican and offered a bounty on O'Flaherty's head. O'Flaherty forgave Kappler after the war, and became a regular visitor to his prison cell - eventually presiding at his conversion to Catholicism. O'Flaherty's story was dramatised in the 1983 film ''[[The Scarlet and the Black]]'' and Ireland honours his work with the Hugh O'Flaherty International Humanitarian Award.<ref>[http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/features/2011/04/13/the-priest-who-converted-his-enemy/ The priest who converted his enemy]; by Stephen Walker, Catholic Herald; 13 April 2011.</ref><ref>[http://www.irishcatholic.ie/20121115/news/vatican-pimpernel-to-gain-official-recognition-S3008.html ]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref>

==Vatican Resistance==

Two Popes served through the Nazi period: [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922<U+2013>1939) and [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939<U+2013>1958). The [[Holy See]] strongly condemned Nazism through the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s, with Cardinal Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) being a particularly outspoken critic. However, following the outbreak of war, Vatican pronouncements became more guarded and Rome pursued its ancient policy of neutrality and openness to the role of peacebroker.<ref name="yadvashem1"/> During the war, Pius XII was praised by Western media as a "lonely voice" against tyranny in Europe and scorned by Hitler as a "Jew lover"<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/09/hitlers-pope-pius-xii-holocaust Vatican hopes secret files exonerate 'Hitler's pope']; Dalya Alberge; [[The Observer]]; 9 February 2013</ref> and a blackmailer on his back, whom he believed constricted his ally Mussolini and leaked confidential German correspondence to the world<ref>[[Hitler's Table Talk]] 1941<U+2013>1944: Religion in Eastern Territories, Cameron & Stevens, Enigma Books pp. 269, 671</ref>

===Pope Pius XI===

[[File:Papst Pius XI. 1JS.jpg|thumb|upright|Pope [[Pius XI]] issued the anti-Nazi encyclical [[Mit Brennender Sorge]] in 1937. It was in part drafted by his successor pontiff, Cardinal Pacelli ([[Pius XII]]).]]

The pontificate of Pius XI coincided with the early aftermath of the First World War. The old European monarchies had been largely swept away and a new and precarious order formed across the continent. In the East, the Soviet Union arose. In Italy, the Fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] took power, while in Germany, the fragile Weimar Republic collapsed with the Nazi seizure of power.<ref name="autogenerated4">Encyclopedia Britannica Online: ''Pius XI''; web Apr. 2013</ref>

In 1929, Pius signed the [[Lateran Treaty]] and a concordat with Italy, confirming the existence of an independent Vatican City state, in return for recognition of the Kingdom of Italy and an undertaking for the papacy to be neutral in world conflicts. In 1933, Pius signed a Concordat with the Germany - hoping to protect the rights of Catholics under the Nazi government. The terms of the Treaty were not kept by Hitler. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica: "From 1933 to 1936 [Pius XI] wrote several protests against the Third Reich, and his attitude toward fascist Italy changed dramatically after Nazi racial policies were introduced into Italy in 1938."<ref name="autogenerated4"/>

Pius XI saw the rising tide of Totalitarianism with alarm and delivered three papal encyclicals challenging the new creeds: against Italian Fascism [[Non abbiamo bisogno]] (1931; ''We Do Not Need to Acquaint You''); against Nazism [[Mit brennender Sorge]] (1937; "With Deep Anxiety") and against atheist Communist [[Divini redemptoris]] (1937; "Divine Redeemer"). He also challenged the extremist nationalism of the Action Francaise movement and anti-semitism in the United States.<ref name="autogenerated4"/>

''Non abbiamo bisogno'' condemned Italian fascism's "pagan worship of the State" and "revolution which snatches the young from the Church and from Jesus Christ, and which inculcates in its own young people hatred, violence and irreverence."<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica Online: ''Fascism - identification with Christianity''; web Apr. 2013</ref>

Pius XI's Secretary of State, Cardinal Pacelli (future Pius XI), made some 55 protests against Nazi policies, including its "ideology of race".<ref name="spectator.org">{{cite web|last=Hume |first=Brit |url=http://spectator.org/archives/2006/08/18/hitlers-pope/print |title=The American Spectator : Hitler's Pope? |publisher=[[The Spectator]] |date=2006-08-18 |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref> As Cardinal Pacelli, Pope Pius XII had assisted Pius XI, draft the Mit Brennender Sorge encyclical powerful critique of Nazi ideology. Pius XI commissioned the American Jesuit John La Farge to draft an encyclical demonstrating the incompatibility of Catholicism and racism: [[Humani generis unitas]] ("The Unity of the Human Race"). Following the death of Pius XI however, the less confrontational Pius XII did not issue the encyclical. He feared it would antagonize Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany at a time where he hoped to act as an impartial peace broker.<ref name="britannica.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-236596 |title=Encyclop<U+0107>dia Britannica's Reflections on the Holocaust |work=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref>

====Mit brennender Sorge====

By early 1937, the church hierarchy in Germany, which had initially attempted to co-operate with the new government, had become highly disillusioned. In March, [[Pope Pius XI]] issued the ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' ({{lang-de|"With burning concern"}}) encyclical. The Pope asserted the inviolability of human rights and  expressed deep concern at the Nazi regime's flouting of the 1933 Concordat, its treatment of Catholics and abuse of Christian values.<ref name="Honourable Defeat p.58" /> It accused the government of "systematic hostility leveled at the Church" and of sowing the "tares of suspicion, discord, hatred, calumny, of secret and open fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church" and Pius noted on the horizon the "threatening storm clouds" of religious wars of extermination over Germany.<ref name="William L. Shirer p234-5"/><ref name="vatican3"/>

The Vatican had the text smuggled into Germany and printed and distributed in secret.<ref name="Honourable Defeat p.58"/> Bishop [[Konrad von Preysing]] was an advisor in the drafting of the document.<ref>[[Joachim Fest]]; ''Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933<U+2013>1945''; Weidenfield & Nicolson; London; p.59</ref> Cardinal Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) also helped draft the encyclical, which was written partly in response to the [[Nuremberg Laws]]. The document does not refer to Hitler or the Nazis by name, but condemned racial theories and the mistreatment of people based on race.<ref name="britannica3"/>

Written in German, not the usual Latin, it was read from the pulpits of all German Catholic churches on one of the Church's busiest Sundays, [[Palm Sunday]]. According to Gill, "Hitler was beside himself with rage. Twelve presses were seized, and hundreds of people sent either to prison or the camps."<ref name="Honourable Defeat p.58"/>

===Pope Pius XII===

With Europe on the brink of war, Pius XI died on 10 Feb 1939 and [[Cardinal Pacelli]] was elected to succeed him as Pope Pius XII. As Vatican Secretary of State, Pacelli had been a critic of Nazism and the Nazi Government was the only government not to send a representative to his coronation.<ref name="spectator.org"/> Pius, a cautious diplomat, pursued the course of diplomacy to attempt to convince European leaders to avoid war.<ref name="autogenerated2"/><ref>[http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20684.pdf Yad Vashem] ''PIUS XII and the Holocaust'' by [[Jonathan Gorsky]]</ref> In his first encyclical, [[Summi Pontificatus]], which came only a month into the war, Pius condemned the war against Poland and looked to its "resurrection".<ref name="Summi Pontificatus">[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html Summi Pontificatus] - Pope [[Pius XII]], Oct. 1939.</ref>

====Encyclicals====

;Summi Pontificatus

''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'' was the first papal encyclical issued by Pope Pius XII, in October 1939 and established some of the themes of his pontificate.  During the drafting of the letter, the Second World War commenced with the Nazi/Soviet invasion of Catholic Poland - the "dread tempest of war is already raging despite all Our efforts to avert it". In a challenge to Nazism, the papal letter denounced racism, anti-semitism, war, totalitarianism, the attack on Poland and the persecution of the Church.<ref name="vatican7">[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html ''SUMMI PONTIFICATUS'' - Section 106]</ref> Pius reiterated Church teaching on the "principle of equality" - with specific reference to Jews: "there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision".<ref name="vatican1939"/> The forgetting of solidarity "imposed by our common origin and by the equality of rational nature in all men" was called "pernicious error".<ref name="vatican4"/> Catholics everywhere were called upon to offer "compassion and help" to the victims of the war.<ref name="vatican5"/> The Pope declared determination to work to hasten the return of peace and trust in prayers for justice, love and mercy, to prevail against the scourge of war.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html Pius XII, ''Summi Pontificatus''; 111; October 1939].</ref> The letter also decried the deaths of noncombatants.<ref name="vatican6"/>

Following themes addressed in [[Non abbiamo bisogno]] (1931); [[Mit brennender Sorge]] (1937) and [[Divini redemptoris]] (1937), Pius wrote of a need to bring back to the Church those who were following "a false standard&nbsp;... misled by error, passion, temptation and prejudice, [who] have strayed away from faith in the true God".<ref name="vatican.va">[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html ''SUMMI PONTIFICATUS'' - Section 6 & 7]</ref> Pius wrote of "Christians unfortunately more in name than in fact" having showed "cowardice" in the face of persecution by these creeds, and called for resistance:<ref name="vatican.va"/>

{{quotation|Who among "the Soldiers of Christ" - ecclesiastic or layman - does not feel himself incited and spurred on to a greater vigilance, to a more determined resistance, by the sight of the ever-increasing host of Christ's enemies&nbsp;... who&nbsp;... wantonly break the Tables of God's Commandments to substitute other tables and other standards stripped of the ethical content of the Revelation on Sinai, standards in which the spirit of the Sermon on the Mount and of the Cross has no place?|''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'' - [[Pope Pius XII]], Oct. 1939}}

Pius wrote of a persecuted Church<ref>108. "In the midst of this world which today presents such a sharp contrast to "The Peace of Christ in the Reign of Christ," the Church and her faithful are in times and in years of trial such as have rarely been known in her history of struggle and suffering".</ref> and a time requiring "charity" for victims who had a "right" to compassion. Against the invasion of Poland and killing of civilians he wrote:<ref name="vatican7"/>

{{quotation|[This is an] "Hour of Darkness"&nbsp;... in which the spirit of violence and of discord brings indescribable suffering on mankind&nbsp;... The nations swept into the tragic whirlpool of war are perhaps as yet only at the "beginnings of sorrows"&nbsp;... but even now there reigns in thousands of families death and desolation, lamentation and misery. The blood of countless human beings, even noncombatants, raises a piteous dirge over a nation such as Our dear Poland, which, for its fidelity to the Church, for its services in the defense of Christian civilization, written in indelible characters in the annals of history, has a right to the generous and brotherly sympathy of the whole world, while it awaits, relying on the powerful intercession of Mary, Help of Christians, the hour of a resurrection in harmony with the principles of justice and true peace.|''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'' - [[Pope Pius XII]], Oct. 1939}}

With Italy not yet an ally of Hitler in the war, Italians were called upon to remain faithful to the Church. Pius avoided explicit denunciations of Hitlerism or Stalinism, establishing the "impartial" public tone which would become controversial in later assessment of his pontificate: "A full statement of the doctrinal stand to be taken in face of the errors of today, if necessary, can be put off to another time unless there is disturbance by calamitous external events; for the moment We limit Ourselves to some fundamental observations."<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html ''SUMMI PONTIFICATUS'' - Section 28]</ref>

; Mystici Corporis Christi

Later in the war Pius issued ''[[Mystici Corporis Christi]]'' (June 29, 1943) on the subject of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] as the Mystical Body of Christ.<ref>Mystici Corporis Christi Pius XII, Encyclical Mystici Corporis Christi, Vatican City, 1943</ref> It followed the commencement of [[Nazi Germany]]'s programs of "[[euthanasia in Nazi Germany|euthanasia]]" of the handicapped, and [[The Holocaust|race-based murders]] of Jews and other minorities, and is therefore significant for its reiteration of Church teachings against racism and the killings of people with disabilities.

Pius' statement of "profound grief" at the murder of the deformed, the insane, and those suffering from hereditary disease&nbsp;... as though they were a useless burden to Society" was a condemnation of the ongoing [[euthanasia in Nazi Germany|Nazi euthanasia program]], under which disabled Germans were being removed from care facilities and murdered by the state as "life unworthy of life". It built upon the high profile condemnations offered by the Archbishop of Munster, August von Galen and others. It was followed, on 26 September 1943, by an open condemnation by the German Bishops which, from every German pulpit, denounced the killing of "innocent and defenceless mentally handicapped, incurably infirm and fatally wounded, innocent hostages, and disarmed prisoners of war and criminal offenders, people of a foreign race or descent".<ref name="Richard J. Evans pp.529-30"/>

====Vatican media and information services====
{{See also|Pope Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address}}

Pope Pius used the Vatican newspaper, L'[[Osservatore Romano]] and the new medium of radio to preach peace, and infuriated the Axis Powers. He established the Vatican Information Service to provide aid to, and information about, war refugees.<ref name="britannica236597">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-236597 |title=Encyclop<U+0107>dia Britannica's Reflections on the Holocaust |work=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> He used radio to preach against selfish nationalism and the evils of modern warfare.<ref name="britannica4"/> The Nazis considered Vatican Radio to be anti-German, and Germans were forbidden to listen to it.<ref name="catholicculture.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=1438&CFID=14594334&CFTOKEN=66641408 |title=Library : The Record of Pius XII's Opposition to Hitler |publisher=Catholic Culture |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref> At the outbreak of the war, Guido Gonella, the chief columnist of the Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, was arrested.

=====Vatican Radio=====

Vatican Radio was the mouthpiece of the Vatican, but was officially run by the Jesuits, who were in turn commanded by the Polish count Wladimir Ledachowski. Hebblethwaite wrote that the Nazis "regarded the German Jesuits to be their main enemy within, as Pius's Secretary, [the German Jesuit] [[Robert Leiber]], as a traitor". In January 1940, the Pope authorised for details of the Polish situation to be broadcast on Vatican Radio's German service. The German ambassador protested the German language broadcasts, and the Pope directed a pause. Other language services were still more explicit, leading the British press to hail Vatican Radio as "tortured Poland's" powerful advocate.<ref>Peter Hebblethwaite; Paul VI, the First Modern Pope; Harper Collins Religious; 1993; p.140</ref>

Following the Pope's first war time Christmas address of 1939, Goebbels noted in his diary: "The Pope has made a Christmas speech. Full of bitter, covert attacks against us, against the Reich, and against National Socialism. All the forces of internationalism are against us. We must break them".<ref>Fred Taylor; ''The Goebbels Diaries 1939<U+2013>1941''; Hamish Hamilton Ltd; London; 1982</ref>

The Nazis considered Vatican Radio to be anti-German, and Germans were forbidden to listen to it. In broadcasts to Spain and France, it denounced the "wickedness of Hitler" and Nazi racial theories and lies.<ref name="catholicculture.org"/> In his Easter 1941 radio address, the Pope denounced "atrocious forms of fighting and mistreatment of prisoners and civilians".<ref name="catholicculture.org"/> Following the Pope's 1941 Christmas address, the New York Times editorial wrote that Pius had placed himself squarely against Hitlerism: "The voice of Pius XII is a lonely voice in the silence and darkness enveloping Europe this Christmas."<ref name="catholicculture.org"/>

;1942 Christmas address

By 1942, the Nazis had commenced their industrialized slaughter of the Jews of Europe<U+2014>the ''[[Final Solution]]''.<ref>Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica : World War Two - German-occupied Europe</ref> Gypsies and others were also marked for extermination. In his [[Pope Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address|Christmas address]] of that year, Pius acknowledged the genocide.<ref name="britannicaoccupied">Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica : ''World War Two - German-occupied Europe''</ref> He again warned against the evils of worshipping the state, and forced labor and addressed the racial persecutions in the following terms:"Humanity owes this vow to those hundreds of thousands who, without any fault on their part, sometimes only because of their nationality or race, have been consigned to death or to a slow decline". The New York Times called Pius "a lonely voice crying out of the silence of a continent."  The speech was made in the context of the near total domination of Europe by the armies of [[Nazi Germany]] at a time were the war had not yet turned in favour of the Allies. Holocaust historian, Sir [[Martin Gilbert]], assesses the response of the Reich Security Main Office calling Pius a "mouthpiece" of the Jews in response to his Christmas address, as clear evidence that all sides knew that Pius was one who was raising his voice for the victims of Nazi terror.<ref name="catholicculture.org"/><ref>''Hitler's Pope?'' by Martin Gilbert; The American Spectator; 18.8.06</ref>

; Holocaust

Following Archbishop [[Jules-G<U+00E9>raud Sali<U+00E8>ge]]'s pastoral letter condemning Nazi anti-Semitism, L'Osservatore Romano praised Saliege, and Vatican Radio broadcast the letter. Bishop [[Pierre-Marie Theas]]'s expression of outrage at "The present anti-Semitic measures" and the French bishops' joint protest against Jewish deportations received full coverage in l'Osservatore Romano and on Vatican Radio. In June 1943, Vatican Radio broadcast to France: "He who distinguishes between Jews and other men is unfaithful to God and is in conflict with God's command" and to Germany on the rights of Jews under [[natural law]] and a defence of Yugoslav Jews.<ref name="catholicculture.org"/>

====Aid to German Resistance and Allies====
{{Main|Pius XII and the German Resistance}}

Following the outbreak of war, Pius followed Vatican precedent and pursued a policy of "impartiality" and sought to act as an intermediary peace broker. Despite this official policy, Pius passed intelligence to the Allies and made a series of condemnations of racism and genocide through the course of the war.<ref name="yadvashem1"/><ref name="autogenerated2"/> Germany regarded Pius as an Allied sympathizer who had violated his own policy of neutrality.<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica Online: ''Roman Catholicism - the period of the world wars''; web Apr 2013</ref>

With Poland overrun but France and the Low Countries yet to be attacked, Colonel [[Hans Oster]] of the Abwehr sent Munich lawyer and devout Catholic, [[Josef M<U+00FC>ller (CSU politician)|Josef M<U+00FC>ller]], on a clandestine trip to Rome to seek Papal assistance in the developing plot by the German military opposition to oust Hitler.<ref name="John Toland p.760" /> The Pope's Private Secretary, [[Robert Leiber]] acted at the intermediary between Pius and the Resistance. He met with M<U+00FC>ller, who visited Rome in 1939 and 1940.<ref name="Peter Hoffmann p.161 & 294"/> Later in the war, Leiber remained the point of contact for communications from Colonel-General [[Ludwig Beck]] in the lead up to the 1944 [[July Plot]].<ref name="Peter Hoffmann p.161 & 294"/> The Vatican considered M<U+00FC>ller to be a representative of Colonel-General von Beck and agreed to offer the machinery for mediation.<ref name="Peter Hoffmann p.160"/><ref name="William L. Shirer p648-9" /> The British agreed to negotiate, provided the Vatican could vouch for the opposition's representative. Pius, communicating with Britain's [[Francis d'Arcy Osborne]], channelled communications back and forth in secrecy.<ref name="Peter Hoffmann p.160"/> The Vatican agreed to send a letter outlining the bases for peace with England and the participation of the Pope was used to try to persuade senior German Generals Halder and Brauchitsch to act against Hitler.<ref name="John Toland p.760" />

Hoffmann wrote that, when the [[Venlo Incident]] stalled the talks, the British agreed to resume discussions primarily because of the "efforts of the Pope and the respect in which he was held. Chamberlain and Halifax set great store by the Pope's readiness to mediate."<ref name="Peter Hoffmann p.160"/> The British government had doubts as to the capacity of the conspirators and was non-committal. Nevertheless, the resistance were encouraged by the talks, and Muller told Leiber that a coup would occur in February.<ref name="Peter Hoffmann p.160-163"/> The negotiations ultimately proved fruitless. Hitler's swift victories over France and the Low Countries deflated the will of the German military to resist Hitler. Muller was arrested during the Nazis first raid on Military Intelligence in 1943. He spent the rest of the war in concentration camps, ending up at Dachau.<ref name="Weidenfeld p.131"/>

At a special mass at St Peters for the victims of the war, held in November 1940, soon after the commencement of the [[London Blitz]] bombing by the [[Luftwaffe]], Pius preached in his homily: "may the whirlwinds, that in the light of day or the dark of night, scatter terror, fire, destruction, and slaughter on helpless folk cease. May justice and charity on one side and on the other be in perfect balance, so that all injustice be repaired, the reign of right restored&nbsp;..."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/PSF/BOX52/a467t01.html |title=Harold->Taylor 9/30/42 |publisher=[[Franklin D.

; Relations with leaders of the Axis and Allies

Through the early stages of the war, Pius continued to hope for a negotiated peace to prevent the spread of the conflict. The similarly minded US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] re-established American diplomatic relations with the Vatican after a seventy-year hiatus and dispatched [[Myron C. Taylor]] as his personal representative.<ref>[http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/VATICAN1.HTML Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum - ''The Vatican Files'']</ref>  Pius warmly welcomed Roosevelt's envoy and peace initiative, calling it "an exemplary act of fraternal and hearty solidarity&nbsp;... in defence against the chilling breath of aggressive and deadly godless anti-Christian tendencies".<ref>[http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box51/a464g02.html Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum - ''Letter from Pius XII to FDR, 7 January 1940'']</ref>

On 4 May 1940, the Vatican advised the Netherlands envoy to the Vatican that the Germans planned to invade France through the Netherlands and Belgium on May 10.<ref>William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; p. 716</ref> In Rome in 1942, US envoy [[Myron C.

Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum - ''Statement by Myron C. Taylor to Pope Pius XII, 19 September 1942'']</ref>

When, in 1940, the Nazi Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop led the only senior Nazi delegation permitted an audience with Pius XII and asked why the Pope had sided with the Allies, Pius replied with a list of recent Nazi atrocities and religious persecutions committed against Christians and Jews, in Germany, and in Poland, leading the New York Times to headline its report "Jews Rights Defended" and write of "burning words he spoke to Herr Ribbentrop about religious persecution".<ref name="spectator.org"/>

Unsuccessfully, Pius attempted to dissuade the Italian Dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] from joining Nazi Germany in the war.<ref name="britannicareflections">[http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-236596 Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online - ''Reflections on the Holocaust'']; web Apr. 2013</ref> Following the Fall of France, Pius XII wrote confidentially to Hitler, Churchill and Mussolini proposing to offer to mediate a "just and honourable peace", but asking to receive confidential advice in advance of how such an offer would be received.<ref>William L.

Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; p. 995</ref> On July 25, the Italian King dismissed Mussolini. Hitler's told Jodl to organise for a German force to go to Rome and arrest the Government and restore Mussolini. Asked about the Vatican, Hitler said: "I'll go right into the Vatican. Do you think the Vatican embarrasses me? We'll take that over right away&nbsp;... later we can make apologies". His generals urged caution, and the plot was not carried out.<ref>William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; pp. 997<U+2013>1000</ref>

Pius had met President Roosevelt before the war. Despite profound fears of Stalinist Totalitarianism, Pius assured American Catholics working in armaments factories that it was acceptable to assist Russia with armaments, as the Russian people had been attacked.<ref name="yadvashem1"/> Pius feared the consequences of the [[Yalta Agreement]] which secured a sphere of Soviet influence in Europe and his church became the target of Communist repression in Eastern Europe, following the war.<ref name="autogenerated2"/> When Italy surrendered to the Allies in 1943, German troops occupied Rome. Thousands of anti-fascists and Jews took refuge in Church buildings during the occupation. Pius declared Rome an "open city", coming to be known as defensor civitatis ("defender of the city").<ref name="britannica4"/>

Following the Liberation of Rome and prior to the collapse of [[Vichy France]], Pius met General [[Charles de Gaulle]], leader of the Free French. At this time, he also held an audience with the British Prime Minister, [[Winston Churchill]]. Despite his long career in Germany, and as a Vatican diplomat, he never once met Adolf Hitler. Following the 4 June 1944 Liberation of Rome by the Allies, Cardinal Tisserant delivered a letter from De Gaulle, assuring the Pontiff of the filial respect and attachment of the French people, and noting that their long wartime suffering had been attenuated by the Pope's "testimonies of paternal affection". Pius thanked De Gaulle for his recognition of the charity works of the papacy for the victims of the war, and offered an Apostolic blessing upon De Gaulle and his nation.<ref name="Piere Blett pp 130-131">Piere Blett; ''Pie XII et la Seconde Guerre Mondiale''; 1997; ISBN 2-262-01324-1; pp. 130<U+2013>31</ref> De Gaulle himself came to meet the Pope on 30 June, following which, the French leader wrote of great admiration for Pius, and assessed him to be a pious, compassionate and thoughtful figure, upon whom the problems of world situation weighed heavily.<ref name="Piere Blett pp 130-131"/> De Gaulle's visit was reported by the Vatican Press in the manner of a head of state, though the Vichy Regime had not yet been toppled.<ref>Piere Blett; ''Pie XII et la Seconde Guerre Mondiale''; 1997; ISBN 2-262-01324-1; p. 132</ref>

German policy towards the Church was at its most severe in the territories it annexed to Greater Germany.

;1944 Uprising

Catholic religious fervour was a feature of the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]]. General [[Antoni Chru<U+015B>ciel]] issued instructions on how front-line troops could continue to pray, recite the rosary and offer confession, and that religious festivals be celebrated. Churches were destroyed, but congregations were not deterred. The religious orders, particularly nuns, devoted themselves to praying for the Uprising. Clergy were involved on many levels - as chaplains to military units, or tending to the ever increasing wounded and dying. "Nuns of various orders", wrote Davies, "acted as universal sisters of mercy and won widespread praise. Mortality among them higher than among most categories of civilians. When captured by the SS, they aroused a special fury, which frequently ended in rape or butchery".<ref>Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Vikiing; 2003; pp.&nbsp;403<U+2013>405</ref> According to Davies, the Catholic religion was integral to the struggle:<ref>Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Vikiing; 2003; p402</ref>

{{quotation|Any description of the Rising which does not present the role of religion in the experiences both of soldiers and civilians is not worth reading. As death in all its forms grew ever more prevalent, the Roman Catholic religion, with its emphasis on redemption and its belief in the afterlife, grew ever more relevant.

Priests held regular masses in all parts of the city, often in abbreviated open-air services among the ruins. They were on constant call to administer the last rites, and to conduct funerals&nbsp;... |Extract from ''Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw'', by Norman Davies}}

Among the hundreds of chaplains attached to the Home Army was [[Stefan Wyszy<U+0144>ski]], who later served as Cardinal Primate of Poland in the Communist era. His parish of Laski was a centre of liberal Polish Catholicism, located in the area of operations of the Home Army's Kampinos Group. The religious communities in general remained during the Uprising, converting their crypts and cellars to bomb shelters and hospitals, and throwing themselves into social work. The enclosed Convent of the Benedictine Sisters of Eternal Adoration lifted a centuries old ban on male visitors to serve as a strategic base for the Home Army and threw open its doors to refugees, who were nursed and fed by the sisters. The prioress received an ultimatum from the Germans, but refused to leave for fear of impact on morale. Davies wrote that the sisters began their evening prayers gathered around the tabernacle, surrounded by a thousand people, as German aircraft flew overhead and "the church collapsed in one thunderous explosion&nbsp;... rescue teams dug to save the living&nbsp;... a much diminished convent choir was singing to encourage them. At dawn a handful of nuns&nbsp;... filed out. Lines of insurgents saluted. And the German guns reopened fire."<ref>Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Vikiing; 2003; p&nbsp;405<U+2013>6</ref>

===Western Europe===

The [[History of the Netherlands (1939<U+2013>1945)|Nazi Occupation of the Netherlands]] was particularly protracted and saw a notably efficient cruelty towards the Jews, and harsh punishment for their protectors. While the Dutch civil service collaborated extensively with the occupying administration, the Dutch Church, and leaders like the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Utrecht|Archbishop of Utrecht]] [[Johannes de Jong]] firmly opposed the National Socialist movement and Dutch Catholics were forbidden from joining it. When Jewish deportations began, many were hidden in Catholic areas. Parish priests created networks for hiding Jews and close knit country parishes were able to hide Jews without being informed upon by neighbours, as occurred in the cities.<ref name="yadvashem5"/>

A significant Dutch Catholic dissident was the Carmelite priest and philosopher, the Blessed [[Titus Brandsma]].<ref name="ncregister.com"/> Brandsma was a journalist and a founder of the Netherlands' Catholic University, who publicly campaigned against Nazism from the mid-1930s. Chosen by the Dutch Bishops as spokesmen in the defence of freedom of the press, he was arrested by the Nazi authorities in January 1942 - telling his captors: ""The Nazi movement is regarded by the Dutch people not only as an insult to God in relation to his creatures, but also a violation of the glorious traditions of the Dutch nation. If it is necessary, we, the Dutch people, will give our lives fur our faith." Transferred to the brutal Amersfoort penal depot, he continued to minister to the other prisoners and challenged them to pray for their captors. He was later transferred to Dachau Concentration camp, where he was the subject of Nazi medical experiments and was issued with a lethal injection on 26 July 1942.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/7th-june-1968/3/beatification-can |title=Beatification Can |publisher=Catholic Herald Archive |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref>

===Italy===
{{main|Italian resistance movement}}

The Italian government switched sides in 1943 and Germany became an occupying force in Italy. Catholic participation in the [[Italian Resistance]] was significant. Catholic Partisans were an important element of the Italian anti-fascist Resistance which took up the fight against Nazi Germany and the actions of Italian clergy and nuns, as well as the interventions of Pope Pius XII saved thousands of Jews from deportation to Nazi death camps.

[[File:An Italian partisan in Florence, 14 August 1944. TR2282.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Man with rifle over his shoulder and ammunition in a belt|An [[Italian partisan]], in 1944. Around 4% of Resistance forces were formally Catholic organisations, but Catholics dominated other "independent groups" such as the ''[[Fiamme Verdi]]'' and ''Osoppo'' partisans.]]

As Italy lurched towards civil war, the Vatican urged moderation. At Easter 1944, Italian bishops were directed from Rome to "stigmatise every form of hatred, of vendetta, reprisal and violence, from wherever it comes". 191 priests were killed by fascists and 125 by the Germans, while 109 were killed by partisans. Though some joined pro-fascist bands, the Vatican backed the so-called anti-Fascist 'partisan chaplains' and 'red priests' fighting with the partisans, hoping that they would provide religious guidance to partisans being exposed to Communist propaganda.<ref>Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire - Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ISBN 978-0-7139-9681-4; pp.504</ref> [[Peter Hebblethwaite]] wrote that, by early 1944, some 20,000 partisans had emerged from [[Azione Cattolica|Catholic Action]], supported by sympathetic provincial clergy in the North, who pronounced the Germans to be "unjust invaders", whom it was lawful and meritorious to repel. "Bishops tended to be more cautious", wrote Hebblethwaite, [[Maurilio Fossati]], the Cardinal Archbishop of Turin "visited partisan units in the mountains, heard their confessions and siad Mass for them."<ref>Peter Hebblethwaite; ''Paul VI - the First Modern Pope; Harper Collins Religious; 1993; p.195</ref>

The armed [[Italian Resistance]] comprised a number of contingents of differing ideological orientation - the largest being the Communist [[:it:Brigate Garibaldi|Garibaldi Brigade]].<ref>''Left Catholicism 1943<U+2013>1955: Catholics and Society in Western Europe at the point of Liberation; edited by Gerd-Rainer Horn & Emmanuel Gerard; Leuven University Press; p.178</ref> Along with Communist, socialist, and monarchist anti-fascists, the Catholic partisans conducted guerrilla warfare against the occupying German Army and Mussolini loyalists between 1943 and 1945. Enjoying wide popular support from the overwhelmingly Catholic population, the Partisans played an important role in the success of the Allied Advance through Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/spring98/OSS.html |title=The OSS and Italian Partisans in World War II |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref>

Around 4% of Resistance forces were formally Catholic organisations, but Catholics dominated other "independent groups" such as the ''[[Fiamme Verdi]]'' and ''Osoppo'' partisans, and there were also Catholic militants in the Garibaldi Brigades, such as [[Benigno Zaccagnini]], who later served as a prominent [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] politician.<ref name="LIberation p.178">''Left Catholicism 1943<U+2013>1955: Catholics and Society in Western Europe at the point of LIberation; edited by Gerd-Rainer Horn & Emmanuel Gerard; Leuven University Press; p.178</ref> In Northern Italy, tensions between Catholics and Communists in the movement led Catholics to form the ''Fiamme Verdi'' as a separate brigade of Christian Democrats in Northern Italy.<ref>Charles T.
