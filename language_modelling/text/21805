[[File:Asian Financial Crisis EN-2009-05-05.png|thumb|Countries most affected by the Asian Crisis.]]
The '''Asian financial crisis''' was a period of [[financial crisis]] that gripped much of [[Asia]] beginning in July 1997, and raised fears of a worldwide economic meltdown due to [[financial contagion]].

The crisis started in [[Thailand]] with the financial collapse of the [[Thai baht]] caused by the decision of the Thai government to [[floating currency|float]] the baht, cutting its [[fixed exchange rate|peg]] to the [[USD]], after exhaustive efforts to support it in the face of a severe financial overextension that was in part [[real estate]] driven. At the time, Thailand had acquired a burden of [[foreign debt]] that made the country effectively [[bankrupt]] even before the collapse of its currency. As the crisis spread, most of [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Japan]] saw slumping currencies, devalued stock markets and other [[asset]] prices, and a precipitous rise in [[private debt]].<ref>Kaufman: pp. 195<U+2013>6</ref>

Though there has been general agreement on the existence of a crisis and its consequences, what is less clear are the causes of the crisis, as well as its scope and resolution. [[Indonesia]], [[South Korea]] and [[Thailand]] were the countries most affected by the crisis. [[Hong Kong]], [[Malaysia]], [[Laos]] and the [[Philippines]] were also hurt by the slump. The [[People's Republic of China]], [[India]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Brunei]] and [[Vietnam]] were less affected, although all suffered from a loss of demand and confidence throughout the region.

Foreign debt-to-GDP ratios rose from 100% to 167% in the four large [[ASEAN]] economies in 1993<U+2013>96, then shot up beyond 180% during the worst of the crisis. In South Korea, the ratios rose from 13 to 21% and then as high as 40%, while the other northern [[Newly industrialized country|newly industrialized countries]] fared much better. Only in Thailand and South Korea did debt service-to-exports ratios rise.<ref>http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Key_Indicators/2003/pdf/rt29.pdf</ref>

Although most of the governments of Asia had seemingly sound [[fiscal policies]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) stepped in to initiate a $40 billion program to stabilize the currencies of [[South Korea]], [[Thailand]], and [[Indonesia]], economies particularly hard hit by the crisis. The efforts to stem a global economic crisis did little to stabilize the domestic situation in [[Indonesia]], however. After 30 years in power, [[President of Indonesia|President]] [[Suharto]]  [[Fall of Suharto|was forced to step down]] on 21 May 1998 in the wake of widespread [[rioting]] that followed sharp price increases caused by a drastic devaluation of the [[rupiah]]. The effects of the crisis lingered through 1998. In the Philippines growth dropped to virtually zero in 1998. Only Singapore and Taiwan proved relatively insulated from the shock, but both suffered serious hits in passing, the former more so due to its size and geographical location between Malaysia and Indonesia. By 1999, however, analysts saw signs that the [[Economy of Asia|economies of Asia]] were beginning to recover.<ref>Pempel: pp 118<U+2013>143</ref>

==History==
Until 1997, Asia attracted almost half of the total [[Capital (economics)|capital]] inflow into [[developing countries]]. The economies of [[Southeast Asia]] in particular maintained high [[interest rates]] attractive to foreign [[investor]]s looking for a high [[rate of return]]. As a result the region's economies received a large inflow of [[money]] and experienced a dramatic run-up in [[asset]] prices. At the same time, the regional economies of [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Singapore]], and [[South Korea]] experienced high growth rates, 8<U+2013>12% GDP, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This achievement was widely acclaimed by financial institutions including the [[IMF]] and [[World Bank]], and was known as part of the "[[Four Asian Tigers|Asian economic miracle]]".

In 1994, noted economist [[Paul Krugman]] published an article attacking the idea of an "Asian economic miracle".<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/myth.html The Myth of Asia's Miracle] A Cautionary Fable by Paul Krugman.</ref> He argued that [[East Asia]]'s economic growth had historically been the result of increasing capital investment. However, [[total factor productivity]] had increased only marginally or not at all. Krugman argued that only growth in total factor productivity, and not capital investment, could lead to long-term [[prosperity]]. Krugman's views would be seen by many as prescient after the financial crisis had become apparent, though he himself stated that he had not predicted the crisis nor foreseen its depth.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The causes of the debacle are many and disputed. Thailand's economy developed into a bubble fueled by "hot money". More and more was required as the size of the bubble grew. The same type of situation happened in Malaysia, and Indonesia, which had the added complication of what was called "[[crony capitalism]]".<ref>Hughes, Helen. [http://www.cis.org.au/POLICY/Spr99/polspr99-1.htm Crony Capitalism and the East Asian Currency Financial 'Crises']. ''Policy''. Spring 1999.</ref> The short-term capital flow was expensive and often highly conditioned for quick [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. Development money went in a largely uncontrolled manner to certain people only, not particularly the best suited or most efficient, but those closest to the centers of power.<ref>Blustein: p. 73</ref>

At the time of the mid-1990s, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea had large private [[current account]] deficits and the maintenance of [[fixed exchange rate]]s encouraged external borrowing and led to excessive exposure to [[foreign exchange risk]] in both the financial and corporate sectors. In the mid-1990s, two factors began to change their economic environment. As the [[U.S. economy]] recovered from a recession in the early 1990s, the [[U.S. Federal Reserve Bank]] under [[Alan Greenspan]] began to raise U.S. interest rates to head off inflation. This made the U.S. a more attractive investment destination relative to Southeast Asia, which had been attracting hot money flows through high short-term interest rates, and raised the value of the U.S. dollar. For the Southeast Asian nations which had currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar, the higher U.S. dollar caused their own exports to become more expensive and less competitive in the global markets. At the same time, Southeast Asia's export growth slowed dramatically in the spring of 1996, deteriorating their current account position.

Some economists have advanced the growing exports of [[People's Republic of China|China]] as a contributing factor to [[ASEAN]] nations' export growth slowdown, though these economists maintain the main cause of the crises was excessive [[real estate]] [[speculation]].<ref>[http://www.newschool.edu/cepa/publications/workingpapers/archive/cepa0318.pdf The Three Routes to Financial Crises: The Need for Capital Controls]. Gabriel Palma (Cambridge University). Center for Economic Policy Analysis. November 2000.</ref> China had begun to compete effectively with other Asian exporters particularly in the 1990s after the implementation of a number of export-oriented reforms. Other economists dispute China's impact, noting that both ASEAN and China experienced simultaneous rapid export growth in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Asia-Pacific Profile |author=Bernard Eccleston, Michael Dawson, Deborah J. McNamara |year=1998 |publisher=Routledge (UK) |url=http://books.google.com/books?visbn=0415172799&id=l07ak-yd6DAC&pg=RA1-PA311&lpg=RA1-PA311&ots=XgqmmGV3CC&dq=%22Bangkok+Declaration%22+ASEAN&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html&sig=u2ddDhzn-yVhEn5Fwu3d8iih0OA|isbn=0415172799 }}</ref>

Many economists believe that the Asian crisis was created not by market psychology or technology, but by policies that distorted incentives within the [[lender]]<U+2013>[[borrower]] relationship. The resulting large quantities of [[Credit (finance)|credit]] that became available generated a highly [[leverage (finance)|leveraged]] economic climate, and pushed up asset prices to an unsustainable level.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/FIRESALE.htm FIRE-SALE FDI] by [[Paul Krugman]].</ref> These asset prices eventually began to collapse, causing individuals and companies to [[Default (finance)|default]] on debt obligations. The resulting panic among lenders led to a large withdrawal of credit from the crisis countries, causing a [[credit crunch]] and further bankruptcies. In addition, as foreign investors attempted to withdraw their money, the [[Foreign exchange market|exchange market]] was flooded with the currencies of the crisis countries, putting [[Depreciation (currency)|depreciative]] pressure on their exchange rates. To prevent currency values collapsing, these countries' governments raised domestic interest rates to exceedingly high levels (to help diminish [[Capital flight|flight of capital]] by making lending more attractive to investors) and to intervene in the exchange market, buying up any excess domestic currency at the [[fixed exchange rate]] with [[foreign reserves]]. Neither of these policy responses could be sustained for long. Very high interest rates, which can be extremely damaging to an economy that is healthy, wreaked further havoc on economies in an already fragile state, while the central banks were hemorrhaging foreign reserves, of which they had finite amounts. When it became clear that the tide of capital fleeing these countries was not to be stopped, the authorities ceased defending their fixed exchange rates and allowed their currencies to [[Floating exchange rate|float]]. The resulting depreciated value of those currencies meant that foreign currency-denominated [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] grew substantially in domestic currency terms, causing more bankruptcies and further deepening the crisis.

Other economists, including [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Jeffrey Sachs]], have downplayed the role of the real economy in the crisis compared to the financial markets. The rapidity with which the crisis happened has prompted Sachs and others to compare it to a classic [[bank run]] prompted by a sudden risk shock. Sachs pointed to strict monetary and contractory fiscal policies implemented by the governments on the advice of the IMF in the wake of the crisis, while [[Frederic Mishkin]] points to the role of [[asymmetric information]] in the financial markets that led to a "[[herd mentality]]" among investors that magnified a small risk in the real economy. The crisis has thus attracted interest from [[behavioral economics|behavioral economists]] interested in [[market psychology]]. Another possible cause of the sudden risk shock may also be attributable to the [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover of Hong Kong sovereignty on 1 July 1997]]. During the 1990s, hot money flew into the Southeast Asia region but investors were often ignorant of the actual fundamentals or risk profiles of the respective economies. The uncertainty regarding the future of Hong Kong led investors to shrink even further away from Asia, exacerbating economic conditions in the area (subsequently leading to the depreciation of the [[Thai baht]] on 2 July 1997).<ref>Stiglitz: pp. 12<U+2013>16</ref>

The foreign ministers of the 10 ASEAN countries believed that the well co-ordinated manipulation of their currencies was a deliberate attempt to destabilize the ASEAN economies. Former Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] accused [[George Soros]] of ruining Malaysia's economy with "massive [[currency speculation]]." (Soros [[George Soros#Currency speculation|claims to have been a buyer]] of the ringgit during its fall, having [[Short (finance)|sold it short]] in 1997.) Mahathir's claims were couched in [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] terms,<ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/3597972/Mahathirs-dark-side.html</ref> and in 2006 he apologized and withdrew the accusations.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200612/s1812946.htm</ref> 

At the 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting held in [[Subang Jaya]], [[Malaysia]], the foreign misisters issued a joint declaration on 25 July 1997 expressing serious concern and called for further intensification of ASEAN's cooperation to safeguard and promote ASEAN's interest in this regard.<ref>[http://www.asean.org/4010.htm Joint Comminuque The 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM)] The Thirtieth ASEAN Ministerial Meeting was held in Subang Jaya, Malaysia from 24 to 25 July 1997.</ref> Coincidentally, on that same day, the central bankers of most of the affected countries were at the EMEAP (Executive Meeting of East Asia Pacific) meeting in [[Shanghai]], and they failed to make the 'New Arrangement to Borrow' operational. A year earlier, the finance ministers of these same countries had attended the 3rd [[APEC]] finance ministers meeting in [[Kyoto]], Japan on 17 March 1996, and according to that joint declaration, they had been unable to double the amounts available under the 'General Agreement to Borrow' and the 'Emergency Finance Mechanism'. As such, the crisis could be seen as the failure to adequately build capacity in time to prevent [[Currency Manipulation]]. This hypothesis enjoyed little support among economists, however, who argue that no single investor could have had enough impact on the market to successfully manipulate the currencies' values. In addition, the level of organization necessary to coordinate a massive exodus of investors from Southeast Asian currencies in order to manipulate their values rendered this possibility remote.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==IMF Role==
Such was the scope and the severity of the collapses involved that outside intervention, considered by many as a new kind of [[colonialism]],<ref>Halloran, Richard. [http://www.bu.edu/globalbeat/pubs/ib24.html China's Decisive Role in the Asian Financial Crisis]. Global Beat Issue Brief No. 24. 27 January 1998.</ref> became urgently needed. Since the countries melting down were among not only the richest in their region, but in the world, and since hundreds of billions of dollars were at stake, any response to the crisis had to be cooperative and international, in this case through the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). The IMF created a series of [[Bail out (finance)|bailouts]] ("rescue packages") for the most affected economies to enable affected nations to avoid [[Default (finance)|default]], tying the packages to reforms that were intended to make the restored Asian currency, banking, and financial systems as much like those of the United States and Europe as possible. In other words, the IMF's support was conditional on a series of drastic economic reforms influenced by [[neoliberal]] economic principles called a "[[structural adjustment]] package" (SAP). The SAPs called on crisis-struck nations to cut back on government spending to reduce deficits, allow [[insolvency|insolvent]] banks and financial institutions to fail, and aggressively raise [[interest rate]]s. The reasoning was that these steps would restore confidence in the nations' fiscal [[solvency]], penalize insolvent companies, and protect currency values. Above all, it was stipulated that IMF-funded capital had to be administered rationally in the future, with no favored parties receiving funds by preference. In at least one of the affected countries the restrictions on foreign  ownership were greatly reduced.<ref>{{citation|last=Woo-Cumings|first=Meredith|authorlink=Meredith Jung-En Woo|title=South Korean Anti-Americanism|publisher=[[Japan Policy Research Institute]]|journal=Working Paper No. 93|date=July 2003|url=http://www.jpri.org/publications/workingpapers/wp93.html}} Korea:"[T]he ceiling on foreign ownership of publicly traded companies was raised to 50 percent from 26 percent; and the ceiling on individual foreign ownership went up from 7 percent to 50 percent."</ref> There were to be adequate government controls set up to supervise all financial activities, ones that were to be independent, in theory, of private interest. Insolvent institutions had to be closed, and insolvency itself had to be clearly defined. In short, exactly the same kinds of financial institutions found in the United States and Europe had to be created in Asia, as a condition for IMF support. In addition, financial systems had to become "transparent", that is, provide the kind of reliable financial information used in the West to make sound financial decisions.<ref>Noland: pp. 98<U+2013>103</ref>

However, the greatest criticism of the IMF's role in the crisis was targeted towards its response.<ref name="waldenbelloimf"/> As country after country fell into crisis, many local businesses and governments that had taken out loans in US dollars, which suddenly became much more expensive relative to the local currency which formed their earned income, found themselves unable to pay their [[creditor]]s. The dynamics of the situation were closely similar to that of the [[Latin American debt crisis]]. The effects of the SAPs were mixed and their impact controversial. Critics, however, noted the contractionary nature of these policies, arguing that in a [[recession]], the traditional [[Keynesian]] response was to increase government spending, prop up major companies, and lower interest rates. The reasoning was that by stimulating the economy and staving off recession, governments could restore confidence while preventing [[pure economic loss|economic loss]]. They pointed out that the [[U.S. government]] had pursued expansionary policies, such as lowering interest rates, increasing government spending, and cutting [[taxes]], when the United States itself entered a recession in 2001, and arguably the same in the fiscal and monetary policies during the 2008<U+2013>2009 Global Financial Crisis.

Although such reforms were, in most cases, long needed {{citation needed|date=October 2010}}), the countries most involved ended up undergoing an almost complete political and financial restructuring. They suffered permanent currency devaluations, massive numbers of bankruptcies, collapses of whole sectors of once-booming economies, [[real estate]] [[Boom and bust|bust]]s, high [[unemployment]], and [[social unrest]]. For most of the countries involved, IMF intervention has been roundly criticized. The role of the International Monetary Fund was so controversial during the crisis that many locals called the financial crisis the "IMF crisis".<ref>[http://www.imfsite.org/recentfin/crisis.html The IMF Crisis] Editorial. Wall Street Journal. 15 April 1998.</ref> Many commentators in retrospect criticized the IMF for encouraging the developing economies of Asia down the path of "fast track capitalism", meaning liberalization of the financial sector (elimination of restrictions on capital flows); maintenance of high domestic interest rates to attract portfolio investment and bank capital; and pegging of the national currency to the dollar to reassure foreign investors against currency risk.<ref name="waldenbelloimf">[http://www.ifg.org/imf_asia.html IMF's Role in the Asian Financial Crisis] by [[Walden Bello]].</ref>

===IMF and high interest rates===

The conventional high-interest-rate economic wisdom is normally employed by monetary authorities to attain the chain objectives of tightened money supply, discouraged currency speculation, stabilized exchange rate, curbed currency depreciation, and ultimately contained inflation.

In the Asian meltdown, highest IMF officials rationalized their prescribed high interest rates as follows:

From then IMF First Deputy Managing Director, Stanley Fischer  (Stanley Fischer,  "The IMF and the Asian Crisis," Forum Funds Lecture at UCLA, Los Angeles on  March  20, 1998):

<U+201D>When their governments "approached the IMF, the reserves of Thailand and South Korea were perilously low, and the Indonesian Rupiah was excessively depreciated. Thus, the first order of business was... to restore confidence in the currency. To achieve this, countries have to make it more attractive to hold domestic currency, which in turn, requires increasing interest rates temporarily, even if higher interest costs complicate the situation of weak banks and corporations...

"Why not operate with lower interest rates and a greater devaluation? This is a relevant tradeoff, but there can be no question that the degree of devaluation in the Asian countries is excessive, both from the viewpoint of the individual countries, and from the viewpoint of the international system. Looking first to the individual country, companies with substantial foreign currency debts, as so many companies in these countries have, stood to suffer far more from<U+2026> currency (depreciation) than from a temporary rise in domestic interest rates<U+2026>. Thus, on macroeconomics<U+2026> monetary policy has to be kept tight to restore confidence in the currency..."

From the then IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus himself ("Doctor Knows Best?"  Asiaweek,  17 July 1998, p.&nbsp;46):

"To reverse (currency depreciation), countries have to make it more attractive to hold domestic currency, and that means temporarily raising interest rates, even if this (hurts) weak banks and corporations."

==Thailand==
{{See|Economy of Thailand}}

From 1985 to 1996, [[Thailand]]'s economy grew at an average of over 9% per year, the highest economic growth rate of any country at the time. Inflation was kept reasonably low within a range of 3.4<U+2013>5.7%.<ref>http://www.columbia.edu/cu/thai/html/financial97_98.html</ref> The baht was pegged at 25 to the US dollar.

On 14 May and 15 May 1997, the [[Thai baht]] was hit by massive speculative attacks. On 30 June 1997, Prime Minister [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]] said that he would not [[devaluation|devalue]] the baht. This was the spark that ignited the Asian financial crisis as the [[Thai government]] failed to defend the baht, which was pegged to the basket of currencies, where U.S. dollar was the main component,<ref>Haider A. Khan, Global Markets and Financial Crises in Asia, University of Denver 2004</ref> against international speculators. Thailand's booming economy came to a halt amid massive [[layoff]]s in [[finance]], [[real estate]], and [[construction]] that resulted in huge numbers of workers returning to their villages in the countryside and 600,000 foreign workers being sent back to their home countries.<ref>Kaufman: pp. 193<U+2013>8</ref> The baht devalued swiftly and lost more than half of its value. The baht reached its lowest point of 56 units to the US dollar in January 1998. The Thai stock market dropped 75%. [[Finance One]], the largest Thai finance company until then, collapsed.<ref>Liebhold, David. [http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1227/thailand.finance.html Thailand's Scapegoat?] Battling extradition over charges of embezzlement, a financier says he's the fall guy for the 1997 financial crash. TIME.com. 27 December 1999.</ref>

The Thai government was eventually forced to float the Baht, on 2 July 1997. On 11 August 1997, the [[IMF]] unveiled a rescue package for Thailand with more than $17 billion, subject to conditions such as passing laws relating to bankruptcy (reorganizing and restructuring) procedures and establishing strong regulation frameworks for banks and other financial institutions. The IMF approved on 20 August 1997, another bailout package of $3.9 billion.

Thai opposition parties claimed that former Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] had profited from the devaluation,<ref>[http://www.pathfinder.com/asiaweek/97/1010/nat2.html Pressure from below: Supporters of the new, improved Constitution now have to help turn words into action] 10 October 1997</ref> It has been investigated by the court of justice and despite comments from former Thaksin cabinet member Sanoh that "There were four people who got involved in the Baht depreciation, i.e. Chavalit, Thaksin, Thanong and Pokin," <ref>http://www.antithaksin.com/041_Sanoh_View.html</ref> no case has been filed against Thaksin for this or any other parties.

By 2001, Thailand's economy had recovered. The increasing [[tax revenue]]s allowed the country to balance its budget and repay its debts to the IMF in 2003, four years ahead of schedule. The Thai baht continued to appreciate to 29 Baht to the Dollar in October 2010.

==Indonesia==
{{See also|Fall of Suharto|Economy of Indonesia}}

In June 1997, [[Indonesia]] seemed far from crisis. Unlike Thailand, Indonesia had low [[inflation]], a [[trade surplus]] of more than $900 million, huge foreign exchange reserves of more than $20 billion, and a good banking sector. But a large number of Indonesian corporations had been borrowing in U.S. dollars. During the preceding years, as the [[rupiah]] had strengthened respective to the dollar, this practice had worked well for these corporations; their effective levels of debt and financing costs had decreased as the local currency's value rose.

In July 1997, when Thailand floated the [[baht]], Indonesia's monetary authorities widened the rupiah [[trading band]] from 8% to 12%. The rupiah suddenly came under severe attack in August. On 14 August 1997, the managed floating exchange regime was replaced by a free-floating exchange rate arrangement. The rupiah dropped further. The IMF came forward with a rescue package of $23 billion, but the rupiah was sinking further amid fears over corporate debts, massive selling of rupiah, and strong demand for dollars. The rupiah and the [[Jakarta Stock Exchange]] touched a historic low in September. [[Moody's]] eventually downgraded Indonesia's long-term debt to '[[junk bond]]'.<ref>{{cite news | publisher = [[Wall Street Journal Online]] | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB882840058627490500.html?mod=googlewsj | title = Japan Stocks Slide Again On Fears About Stability | date = 26 December 1997 | accessdate = 2 September 2009 | first=Anita | last=Raghavan}}</ref>

Although the rupiah crisis began in July and August 1997, it intensified in November when the effects of that summer devaluation showed up on corporate balance sheets. Companies that had borrowed in dollars had to face the higher costs imposed upon them by the rupiah's decline, and many reacted by buying dollars through selling rupiah, undermining the value of the latter further. In February 1998, President [[Suharto]] sacked [[Bank Indonesia]] Governor [[J. Soedradjad Djiwandono]], but this proved insufficient. Suharto resigned under public pressure in May 1998 and Vice President [[Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie|B. J. Habibie]] was elevated in his place. Before the crisis, the exchange rate between the [[rupiah]] and the dollar was roughly 2,600 rupiah to 1 USD.<ref>http://www.oanda.com/convert/fxhistory August 13 = 2673; August 14 = 2790; August 15 = 2900; August 31 = 2930; October 31 = 3640; December 31 = 5535.

==South Korea==
{{See|Economy of South Korea}} <!-- there is very little "further information" on the imf crisis in South Korea at this link -->
{{South Korean economy}}
Macroeconomic fundamentals in [[South Korea]] were good but the banking sector was burdened with [[non-performing loan]]s as its large corporations were funding aggressive expansions. During that time, there was a haste to build great conglomerates to compete on the world stage. Many businesses ultimately failed to ensure returns and profitability. The South Korean conglomerates, more or less completely controlled by the government, simply absorbed more and more capital investment. Eventually, excess debt led to major failures and takeovers. For example, in July 1997, South Korea's third-largest car maker, [[Kia Motors]], asked for emergency loans. In the wake of the Asian market downturn, [[Moody's]] lowered the [[credit rating]] of South Korea from A1 to A3, on 28 November 1997, and downgraded again to B2 on 11 December. That contributed to a further decline in South Korean shares since stock markets were already bearish in November. The [[Korea Exchange|Seoul stock exchange]] fell by 4% on 7 November 1997. On 8 November, it plunged by 7%, its biggest one-day drop to that date. And on 24 November, stocks fell a further 7.2% on fears that the IMF would demand tough reforms. In 1998, [[Hyundai Motors]] took over Kia Motors. [[Samsung]] Motors' $5 billion dollar venture was dissolved due to the crisis, and eventually [[Daewoo]] Motors was sold to the American company [[General Motors]] (GM).

The [[South Korean won]], meanwhile, weakened to more than 1,700 per dollar from around 800. Despite an initial sharp economic slowdown and numerous corporate bankruptcies, South Korea has managed to triple its [[per capita GDP]] in dollar terms since 1997. Indeed, it resumed its role as the world's fastest-growing economy<U+2014>since 1960, per capita GDP has grown from $80 in nominal terms to more than $21,000 as of 2007. However, like the [[chaebol]], South Korea's government did not escape unscathed. Its [[national debt]]-to-[[GDP]] ratio more than doubled (app. 13% to 30%) as a result of the crisis.

In South Korea, the crisis is also commonly referred to as the '''IMF crisis'''.

==Philippines==
{{See|Economy of the Philippines}}
The [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas|Philippine central bank]] raised [[interest rate]]s by 1.75 percentage points in May 1997 and again by 2 points on 19 June. Thailand triggered the crisis on 2 July and on 3 July, the Philippine Central Bank was forced to intervene heavily to defend the [[Philippine peso|peso]], raising the overnight rate from 15% to 32% right upon the onset of the Asian crisis in mid-July 1997. The peso fell significantly, from 26 pesos per dollar at the start of the crisis, to 38 pesos as of mid-1999, and to 54 pesos as of first half August 2001.

The Philippine economy recovered from a contraction of 0.6% in GDP during the worst part of the crisis to GDP growth of some 3% by 2001, despite scandals of the administration of [[Joseph Estrada]] in 2001, most notably the "jueteng" scandal, causing the [[PSE Composite Index]], the main index of the Philippine Stock Exchange, to fall to some 1000 points from a high of some 3000 points in 1997. The peso fell even further, trading at levels of about 55 pesos to the US dollar. Later that year, Estrada was on the verge of impeachment but his allies in the senate voted against the proceedings to continue further. This led to popular protests culminating in the "[[EDSA II Revolution]]", which finally forced his resignation and elevated [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] to the presidency. Arroyo managed to lessen the crisis in the country, which led to the recovery of the Philippine peso to about 50 pesos by the year's end and traded at around 41 pesos to a dollar by end 2007. The stock market also reached an all time high in 2007 and the economy is growing by at least more than 7 percent, its highest in nearly 2 decades.

==Hong Kong==
{{See|Economy of Hong Kong}}

Although the two events were unrelated, the collapse of the [[Thai baht]] on 2 July 1997, came only 24 hours after the [[United Kingdom]] [[Transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|handed over sovereignty of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China]]. In October 1997, the [[Hong Kong dollar]], which had been pegged at 7.8 to the [[U.S. dollar]] since 1983, came under speculative pressure because [[Hong Kong]]'s inflation rate had been significantly higher than the U.S.'s for years. Monetary authorities spent more than US$1 billion to defend the local currency. Since Hong Kong had more than US$80 billion in foreign reserves, which is equivalent to 700% of its [[Money supply#Scope|M1]] money supply and 45% of its M3 money supply,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} the [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]] (effectively the city's central bank) managed to maintain the peg.

Stock markets became more and more volatile; between 20 October and 23 October the [[Hang Seng Index]] dropped 23%. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority then promised to protect the currency. On 15 August 1998, it raised overnight [[interest rate]]s from 8% to 23%, and at one point to 500%.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The HKMA had recognized that speculators were taking advantage of the city's unique currency-board system, in which overnight rates automatically increase in proportion to large net sales of the local currency. The rate hike, however, increased downward pressure on the stock market, allowing speculators to profit by [[short selling]] shares. The HKMA started buying component shares of the Hang Seng Index in mid-August.

The HKMA and [[Donald Tsang]], then the Financial Secretary, declared war on speculators. The Government ended up buying approximately HK$120 billion (US$15 billion) worth of shares in various companies,<ref>Bayani Cruz, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=48383&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=19980829&sear_year=1998 We will hold on to blue-chip shares: Tsang], [[The Standard]], 29 August 1998.</ref> and became the largest shareholder of some of those companies (e.g. the government owned 10% of [[HSBC]]) at the end of August, when hostilities ended with the closing of the August Hang Seng Index futures contract. In 1999, the Government started selling those shares by launching the [[Tracker Fund of Hong Kong]], making a profit of about HK$30 billion (US$4 billion).

==Malaysia==
{{See|Economy of Malaysia}}
Before the crisis, [[Malaysia]] had a large [[current account deficit]] of 5% of its [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. At the time, Malaysia was a popular investment destination, and this was reflected in [[Bursa Malaysia|KLSE]] activity which was regularly the most active stock exchange in the world (with turnover exceeding even markets with far higher [[capitalization]] like the [[NYSE]]). Expectations at the time were that the growth rate would continue, propelling Malaysia to [[developed country|developed status]] by 2020, a government policy articulated in [[Wawasan 2020]]. At the start of 1997, the KLSE [[Composite (finance)|Composite]] [[index (economics)|index]] was above 1,200, the ringgit was trading above 2.50 to the dollar, and the [[overnight rate]] was below 7%.

In July 1997, within days of the [[Thai baht]] devaluation, the Malaysian [[ringgit]] was "attacked" by [[speculation|speculators]]. The overnight rate jumped from under 8% to over 40%. This led to rating downgrades and a general sell off on the stock and currency markets. By end of 1997, ratings had fallen many notches from investment grade to [[junk]]{{dn}}, the KLSE had lost more than 50% from above 1,200 to under 600, and the ringgit had lost 50% of its value, falling from above 2.50 to under 4.10 to the dollar. The then premier, [[Mahathir Mohammad]] imposed strict capital controls and introduced a 3.80 peg against the [[US dollar]]

In 1998, the output of the real economy declined plunging the country into its first [[recession]] for many years. The [[construction]] sector contracted 23.5%, [[manufacturing]] shrunk 9% and the [[agriculture]] sector 5.9%. Overall, the country's gross domestic product plunged 6.2% in 1998. During that year, the ringgit plunged below 4.7 and the KLSE fell below 270 points. In September that year, various defensive measures were announced to overcome the crisis. The principal measure taken were to move the ringgit from a free float to a [[fixed exchange rate]] regime. [[Bank Negara]] fixed the ringgit at 3.8 to the dollar. Capital controls were imposed while aid offered from the IMF was refused. Various task force agencies were formed. The Corporate Debt Restructuring Committee dealt with corporate loans. [[Danaharta]] discounted and bought bad loans from banks to facilitate orderly asset realization. [[Danamodal]] recapitalized banks.

Growth then settled at a slower but more sustainable pace. The massive current account deficit became a fairly substantial surplus. Banks were better capitalized and NPLs were realised in an orderly way. Small banks were bought out by strong ones. A large number of PLCs were unable to regulate their financial affairs and were delisted. Compared to the 1997 current account, by 2005, Malaysia was estimated to have a US$14.06 billion surplus.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/my.html The CIA World Factbook - Malaysia]</ref> Asset values however, have not returned to their pre-crisis highs. In 2005 the last of the crisis measures were removed as the ringgit was taken off the fixed exchange system. But unlike the pre-crisis days, it did not appear to be a free float, but a managed float, like the [[Singapore dollar]].

==Singapore==
{{See|Economy of Singapore}}

As the financial crisis [[financial contagion|spread]] the economy of Singapore dipped into a short recession. The short duration and milder effect on its economy was credited to the active management by the government. For example, the [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]] allowed for a gradual 20% depreciation of the [[Singapore dollar]] to cushion and guide the economy to a soft landing. The timing of government programs such as the Interim Upgrading Program and other construction related projects were brought forward. Instead of allowing the labor markets to work, the National Wage Council pre-emptively agreed to [[Central Provident Fund]] cuts to lower labor costs, with limited impact on [[disposable income]] and local demand. Unlike in Hong Kong, no attempt was made to directly intervene in the [[capital market]]s and the [[Straits Times Index]] was allowed to drop 60%. In less than a year, the Singaporean economy fully recovered and continued on its growth trajectory.<ref>Ngian Kee Jin: p. 12</ref>

==China==
{{See|Economy of the People's Republic of China}}

The Chinese currency, the [[renminbi]] (RMB), had been [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged to the US dollar]] at a ratio of 8.3 RMB to the dollar, in 1994. Having largely kept itself above the fray throughout 1997<U+2013>1998 there was heavy speculation in the [[Western world|Western]] [[news|press]] that China would soon be forced to [[devalue]] its currency to protect the [[competitiveness]] of its exports vis-a-vis those of the [[ASEAN]] nations, whose exports became cheaper relative to China's. However, the RMB's non-[[convertibility]] protected its value from currency [[speculation|speculators]], and the decision was made to maintain the peg of the currency, thereby improving the country's standing within Asia. The currency peg was partly scrapped in July 2005 rising 2.3% against the dollar, reflecting pressure from the United States.

Unlike investments of many of the [[Southeast Asian]] nations, almost all of China's [[foreign investment]] took the form of [[factories]] on the ground rather than [[securities]], which insulated the country from rapid [[capital flight]]. While China was unaffected by the crisis compared to Southeast Asia and South Korea, GDP growth slowed sharply in 1998 and 1999, calling attention to structural problems within its economy. In particular, the Asian financial crisis convinced the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] of the need to resolve the issues of its enormous financial weaknesses, such as having too many [[non-performing loans]] within its [[banking system]], and relying heavily on trade with the United States.

==United States and Japan==
{{See|Economy of the United States|Economy of Japan}}

The "Asian flu" had also put pressure on the [[United States]] and [[Japan]]. Their markets did not collapse, but they were severely hit. On 27 October 1997, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones industrial]] plunged 554 points or 7.2%, amid ongoing worries about the [[Economy of Asia|Asian economies]]. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] briefly suspended trading. The crisis led to a drop in [[consumer confidence|consumer]] and spending [[confidence]] (see 27 October 1997 [[October 27, 1997 mini-crash|mini-crash]]). Indirect effects included the [[dot-com bubble]], and years later the [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]] and the [[Subprime mortgage crisis]]. Japan was affected because its economy is prominent in the region. Asian countries usually run a [[trade deficit]] with Japan because the latter's economy was more than twice the size of the rest of Asia together; about 40% of Japan's exports go to Asia. The [[Japanese yen]] fell to 147 as mass selling began, but Japan was the world's largest holder of currency reserves at the time, so it was easily defended, and quickly bounced back. GDP real growth rate slowed dramatically in 1997, from 5% to 1.6% and even sank into recession in 1998, due to intense competition from cheapened rivals. The Asian financial crisis also led to more [[bankruptcy|bankruptcies]] in Japan. In addition, with South Korea's devalued currency, and China's steady gains, many companies complained outright that they could not compete.<ref>Pettis: pp. 55<U+2013>60</ref>

Another longer-term result was the changing relationship between the U.S. and Japan, with the U.S. no longer openly supporting the highly artificial trade environment and exchange rates that governed economic relations between the two countries for almost five decades after [[World War II]].<ref>Pettis: p. 79</ref>

==Consequences==
===Asia===
The crisis had significant [[macroeconomics|macro]]-level effects, including sharp reductions in values of [[currency|currencies]], [[stock market]]s, and other [[asset]] prices of several [[Asian countries]].<ref>Tiwari: pp. 1<U+2013>3</ref> The nominal US dollar GDP of ASEAN fell by US$9.2 billion in 1997 and $218.2 billion (31.7%) in 1998. In South Korea, the $170.9 billion fall in 1998 was equal to 33.1% of the 1997 GDP.<ref name="autogenerated1">http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Key_Indicators/2001/rt11_ki2001.xls</ref> Many [[business]]es collapsed, and as a consequence, millions of people fell below the [[poverty line]] in 1997<U+2013>1998. [[Indonesia]], [[South Korea]] and [[Thailand]] were the countries most affected by the crisis.

The above tabulation shows that despite the prompt raising of interest rates to 32% in the Philippines upon the onset of crisis in mid-July 1997, and to 65% in Indonesia upon the intensification of crisis in 1998, their local currencies depreciated just the same and did not perform better than those of South Korea, Thailand, and Malaysia, which countries had their high interest rates set at generally lower than 20% during the Asian crisis. This created grave doubts on the credibility of IMF and the validity of its high-interest-rate prescription to economic crisis.

The economic crisis also led to a political upheaval, most notably culminating in the resignations of President [[Suharto]] in Indonesia and Prime Minister General [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]] in Thailand. There was a general rise in anti-Western sentiment, with [[George Soros]] and the [[IMF]] in particular singled out as targets of criticisms. Heavy U.S. investment in Thailand ended, replaced by mostly [[Europe]]an investment, though Japanese investment was sustained. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} [[Islam]]ic and other  [[separatism|separatist movements]] intensified in [[Southeast Asia]] as central authorities weakened.<ref>Radelet: pp. 5<U+2013>6</ref>

More long-term consequences included reversal of the relative gains made in the boom years just preceding the crisis. Nominal US dollar GDP per capital fell 42.3% in Indonesia in 1997, 21.2% in Thailand, 19% in Malaysia, 18.5% in South Korea and 12.5% in the Philippines.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The [[CIA World Factbook]] reported that the [[per capita income]] (measured by [[purchasing power parity]]) in Thailand declined from $8,800 to $8,300 between 1997 and 2005; in Indonesia it declined from $4,600 to $3,700; in Malaysia it declined from $11,100 to $10,400. Over the same period, world per capita income rose from $6,500 to $9,300.<ref>[http://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedfsp/y2007ifeb6.html The Asian financial crisis ten years later: assessing the past and looking to the future]. Janet L. Yellen. Speech to the Asia Society of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, 6 February 2007</ref> Indeed, the [[CIA]]'s analysis asserted that the [[economy of Indonesia]] was still smaller in 2005 than it had been in 1997, suggesting an impact on that country similar to that of the [[Great Depression]]. Within [[East Asia]], the bulk of investment and a significant amount of economic weight shifted from [[Japan]] and ASEAN to [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[India]].<ref>Kilgour, Andrea (1999). The changing economic situation in Vietnam: A product of the Asian crisis?</ref>

The crisis has been intensively analyzed by [[economist]]s for its breadth, speed, and dynamism; it affected dozens of countries, had a direct impact on the livelihood of millions, happened within the course of a mere few months, and at each stage of the crisis leading economists, in particular the international institutions, seemed a step behind. Perhaps more interesting to economists was the speed with which it ended, leaving most of the [[developed economies]] unharmed. These curiosities have prompted an explosion of literature about [[financial economics]] and a litany of explanations why the crisis occurred. A number of critiques have been leveled against the conduct of the [[IMF]] in the crisis, including one by former [[World Bank]] economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]]. Politically there were some benefits. In several countries, particularly [[South Korea]] and Indonesia, there was renewed push for improved [[corporate governance]]. Rampaging [[inflation]] weakened the authority of the Suharto regime and led to its toppling in 1998, as well as accelerating [[East Timor]]'s independence.<ref>Weisbrot: p. 6</ref>

===Outside Asia===
After the Asian crisis, international investors were reluctant to lend to [[developing countries]], leading to economic slowdowns in developing countries in many parts of the world. The powerful negative shock also sharply reduced the price of [[oil]], which reached a low of $8 [[per barrel]] towards the end of 1998, causing a financial pinch in [[OPEC]] nations and other oil exporters. This reduction in oil revenue contributed to the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]], which in turn caused [[Long-Term Capital Management]] in the United States to collapse after losing $4.6 billion in 4 months. A wider collapse in the financial markets was avoided when [[Alan Greenspan]] and the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] organized a $3.625 billion [[bail-out]]. Major emerging economies [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]] also fell into crisis in the late 1990s (see [[Argentine economic crisis|Argentine debt crisis]]).<ref>''The Crash'' transcript. PBS Frontline.</ref>

The crisis in general was part of a global backlash against the [[Washington Consensus]] and institutions such as the [[IMF]] and [[World Bank]], which simultaneously became unpopular in developed countries following the rise of the [[anti-globalization movement]] in 1999. Four major rounds of world trade talks since the crisis, in [[Seattle]], [[Doha]], [[Canc<U+00FA>n]], and Hong Kong, have failed to produce a significant agreement as developing countries have become more assertive, and nations are increasingly turning toward regional or bilateral [[free trade agreement]]s (FTAs) as an alternative to global institutions. Many nations learned from this, and quickly built up [[foreign exchange reserve]]s as a hedge against attacks, including Japan, China, South Korea. [[Pan Asian]] currency swaps were introduced in the event of another crisis. However, interestingly enough, such nations as Brazil, Russia, and India as well as most of East Asia began copying the Japanese model of weakening their currencies, restructuring their economies so as to create a [[current account]] surplus to build large [[foreign currency reserves]]. This has led to an ever increasing funding for US [[treasury bonds]], allowing or aiding housing (in 2001<U+2013>2005) and stock asset bubbles (in 1996<U+2013>2000) to develop in the United States.
