'''''Colossal Cave Adventure''''' (also known as '''''ADVENT''''', '''''Colossal Cave''''', or '''''Adventure''''')<ref>Crowther, 1976; Crowther & Woods, 1977.</ref> was the first computer [[adventure game]]. It was originally designed by [[William Crowther|Will Crowther]], a [[programmer]] and [[spelunking]] enthusiast who based the layout on part of the [[Mammoth Cave National Park|Mammoth Cave]] system in [[Kentucky]].<ref name=Montfort>Montfort, Nick (2003). Twisty Little Passages: An Approach To Interactive Fiction. Cambridge: The MIT Press. ISBN 0-262-13436-5</ref>  The Colossal Cave subnetwork has many entrances, one of which is known as Bedquilt.  Crowther reproduced portions of the real cave so faithfully that cavers who have played the game can easily navigate through familiar sections in the Bedquilt region on their first visit.<ref name="Bedquilt">Mel Park. Bev Schwartz meets the real [http://www.rickadams.org/adventure/b_cave.html Bedquilt]</ref>

== History ==
[[William Crowther|Will Crowther]] was a [[programmer]] at [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman|Bolt, Beranek & Newman]], which developed the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency Network|ARPANET]] (a forerunner of the [[Internet]]).  Crowther was a [[spelunker]], who applied his experience in [[Mammoth Cave National Park|Mammoth Cave]] (in [[Kentucky]]) to create a game that he could enjoy with his young daughters.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rickadams.org/adventure/a_history.html | title = Here's where it all began<U+2026> | work = The Colossal Cave Adventure page | author = Rick Adams }}</ref>

Crowther had explored the Mammoth Cave in the early 1970s, and created a vector map based on surveys of parts of the real cave, but the text game is a completely separate entity, created during the 1975-76 academic year <ref name=Jerz>Jerz, Dennis (2007) ''[http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/001/2/000009.html Somewhere Nearby Is Colossal Cave:  Examining Will Crowther's Original <U+201C>Adventure<U+201D> in Code and in Kentucky]'', Digital Humanities Quarterly</ref>  and featuring fantasy elements such as an axe-throwing [[dwarf]] and a magic bridge. 
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:You are standing.jpg|thumb|200px|Image of Advent running on an Osbourne Computer circa 1983]] -->

The version that is best known today was the result of a collaboration with [[Don Woods]], a graduate student who discovered the game on a computer at [[Stanford University]]<ref>[http://www.avventuretestuali.com/interviste/woods-eng L<U+2019>avventura <U+00E8> l<U+2019>avventura <U+00BB> Interactive Fiction? I prefer Adventure<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and made significant expansions and improvements, with Crowther's blessing.  A big fan of [[Tolkien]], he introduced additional fantasy elements, such as [[elf|elves]] and a [[troll]].

Until the 2007-2008 academic year, students at [[Stanford University]] were required to re-implement the game as an assignment in the first [[computer programming]] course.

''Colossal Cave'' also holds a prominent place in computing history: when Roberta Williams and her husband Ken found the game, and were subsequently unable to find anything similar, they were inspired to found On-Line Software (later Sierra Online, and then Sierra Entertainment), which created the first graphical adventure game (''Mystery House''), and then quickly came to dominate the entertainment software market for the next two decades.

== Technology ==
Crowther's original game consisted of about 700 lines of [[Fortran]] code, with about another 700 lines of data, written for BBN's [[PDP-10]]. (See the [http://jerz.setonhill.edu/if/crowther/ original source code]) The program required about 60K words (nearly 300KB) of core memory in order to run, which was a significant amount for PDP-10/KA systems running with only 128K words.

In 1977, [[Jim Gillogly]] of the [[RAND|RAND Corporation]] spent several weeks porting the code from Fortran to [[C (programming language)|C]] under [[Unix]], with the agreement of both Woods and Crowther.

The game was also ported to [[Prime Computer]]'s super-mini running [[PRIMOS]] in the late 1970s, utilising Fortran 4, and to IBM mainframes running VM/CMS in late 1978, utilizing PL/1.

Later versions of the game moved away from general purpose programming languages such as C or Fortran, and were instead written for special interactive fiction engines, such as Infocom's [[Z-machine]].

== Later versions ==

[[Image:Colossaladventure.gif|thumb|200px|Later versions of the game added pictures.]]
Many versions of ''Colossal Cave'' have been released, mostly entitled simply ''Adventure'', or adding a tag of some sort to the original name (e.g. ''Adventure II'', ''Adventure 550'', ''Adventure4+'', ...).  [[Microsoft]] released a version of ''Adventure'' with its initial version of [[MS-DOS]] 1.0 for the IBM PC (on a single sided disk, requiring 32KB of RAM). Russel Dalenberg's Adventure Family Tree page<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.io.com/~ged/www/family.html | title = Adventure Family Tree | format = ASCII Art | author = Russel Dalenberg | date = March 20 2004 }}</ref>
provides the best (though still incomplete) summary of different versions and their relationships.

Until Crowther's original version was found,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.int-fiction/browse_thread/thread/607acaf1a279d4dd/184277a1dfdf7bd9 |title=
Adventure: Crowther's original source code found; photos from inside the real Colossal Cave }}</ref> the "definitive original" was generally considered to be the version that Don Woods expanded in 1977.  As part of that expansion, Woods added a scoring system that went up to 350 points. Extended versions with extra puzzles go up to 1000 points or more. The AMP [[MUD]] had a multi-player ''Colossal Cave''.

Dave Platt's influential 550 points version was innovative in a number of ways. It broke away from coding the game directly in a programming language such as Fortran or C. Instead, Platt developed A-code <U+2014> a language for adventure programming <U+2014> and wrote his extended version in that language. The A-code source was pre-processed by an F77 "munger"  program, which translated A-code into a text database, and a tokenised pseudo-binary. These were then distributed together with a generic A-code F77 "executive", also written in F77, which effectively "ran" the tokenised pseudo-binary.

Platt's version was also notable for providing a randomised variety of responses when informing the player that, e.g., there was no exit in the nominated direction, for introducing a number of rare "cameo" events, and for committing some outrageous puns.

==Memorable words and phrases==
{{wikiquote}}

===Xyzzy===
{{main|Xyzzy}}
"Xyzzy" is a magic word that teleports the player between two locations ("inside building" and the "debris room"). Entering the command from other locations produces the disappointing response "Nothing happens."  As an in-joke, many later computer programs (not only games but also applications) include a hidden 'xyzzy' command -- the results of which range from the humorous to the straightforward.<ref name=xyzzy>{{cite web | url = http://www.rickadams.org/adventure/c_xyzzy.html | title = Everything you ever wanted to know about<U+2026>the magic word XYZZY | work = The Colossal Cave Adventure page | author = Rick Adams }}</ref>  The origin of the term 'xyzzy' is heavily debated among the game's fanbase, and Crowther and Woods stated that they don't remember its signifigance in caving jargon.

===Maze of twisty little passages===
''"You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike"'' is a memorable line from the game, popular in [[Hacker (free and open source software)|hacker]] culture (where "passages" may be replaced with a different word, as the situation warrants).  This phrase came to signify a situation when whatever action is taken does not change the result.

The "all alike" maze was created by Crowther; Woods created a second maze, described as "all different" <ref name=Jerz>Jerz, Dennis (2007) ''[http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/001/2/000009.html Somewhere Nearby Is Colossal Cave:  Examining Will Crowther's Original <U+201C>Adventure<U+201D> in Code and in Kentucky]'', Digital Humanities Quarterly</ref>.   In the "all different" maze, the player's current location is described in eleven different ways:
* Little maze of twisting passages
* Little maze of twisty passages
* Little twisty maze of passages
* Maze of little twisting passages
* Maze of little twisty passages
* Maze of twisting little passages
* Maze of twisty little passages
* Twisting little maze of passages
* Twisting maze of little passages
* Twisty little maze of passages
* Twisty maze of little passages
Don Woods was doing doctoral research in [[graph (data structure)|graph]] algorithms, and he designed this maze as (almost) a [[complete graph]], with two exceptions important to game play. One potential name variation, "little twisting maze of passages", is not used.

===Plugh===
When the player first arrives at an area known as "Y2", the player receives the message ''A hollow voice says "plugh".'' The magic word takes the player between the rooms "inside building" and "Y2". A popular theory is that the word is short for "plughole" (allegedly a caver term) but no evidence supports this claim, and the game does not feature a plughole in this location.

===Other lines===
Other memorable lines from the game are:
* ''Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding.  Anyway, nothing exciting happens.''
* ''A huge green fierce snake bars the way!'' 
* (When trying to kill the snake, a [[western dragon|dragon]], or such:) ''With what? Your bare hands?'' 
* (When trying to kill the bear) ''With what? Your bare hands? Against his bear hands?'' 
* (If you try to feed the bird:) ''It's not hungry (it's merely pinin' for the fjords).''  &mdash; a reference to [[Monty Python]]'s [[Dead Parrot|Dead Parrot sketch]]
* (If you hit the bear after feeding it:) ''The bear is confused. He only wants to be your friend.''
* The game responds to a frustrated player's swearing with ''watch it!'' and to commands to eat inappropriate things (''e.g.'', the bird, the snake) with ''Yecch!''
* A sign at a stone bridge warns, "Stop, pay troll."
* (If you type the word ''Blast'':) ''Blasting requires dynamite''
* (If you type the word ''Dynamite'':) ''I see no dynamite here''
* (If you type a word that describes an object you see in the forrest: ) ''The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite a bit of undergrowth, largely birch and ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of various sorts. This time of year visibility is quite restricted by all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour around the spruce and berry bushes.''

===Continued development===

According to author Dale Peterson, Don Woods continued releasing updated editions through to at least the mid-1990s.<ref>Peterson, Dale: "Genesis II: Creation and Recreation with Computers", (1983)</ref> Just as Woods picked up the development of Adventure where Crowther left off, other programmers continued the story in their own way.

====Dave Platt====
Dave Platt's 550-point version of ''Colossal Cave'' <U+2014> perhaps the most famous variant of this game other than the original, itself a jumping-off point for many other versions including Michael Goetz's 581 point [[CP/M]] version <U+2014> included a long extension on the other side of the [[Volcano]] View.  Eventually, the player descends into a maze of catacombs and a "fake Y2". If the player says "plugh" here the player finds himself or herself transported to a "Precarious Chair" suspended in midair above the molten [[lava]].  (The 581-point version was on SIGM011 from the [[CP/M Users Group]], 1984.)

Some games recognize "plugh" and will respond to it, usually by making a joke.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webhome.idirect.com/~dswxyz/sol/plugh.html|title=>plugh responses|author=David Welbourn}} A web page giving responses to "plugh" in many games of interactive fiction</ref>  The adventure game ''[[Prisoner 2]]'' contained a cavern with the word "PLUGH" written on the wall; if the player typed this word into the command parser, he was sent back to his starting point.

Down the hall from Platt, three programmers were developing a debugger for a commercial operating system (CP6).  They added a command to show a [[stack trace]], and called the command <U+201C>plugh<U+201D>.  The command passed all internal reviews for release until a technical writer refused to allow a funny word that didn<U+2019>t mean anything to be included in the product.  A lengthy development meeting determined that plugh stood for <U+201C>Procedure List Used to Get Here<U+201D>.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Dave Platt's 550-point F77 version had some memorable moments as well:

* ''Into view there bounces a horrible creature!! Six feet across, it resembles a large blob of translucent white jelly; although it looks massive, it is bouncing lightly up and down as though it were as light as a feather. It is emitting a constant throbbing sound, and it >ROAR<s loudly as it sees you.'' &mdash; this is a reference to [[Rover (The Prisoner)|Rover]] from ''[[The Prisoner]]''

Platt also had a number of "cameos" <U+2014> very rare random events of no consequence. For example:

* ''From the darkness nearby comes the sound of shuffling feet. As you turn towards the sound, a nine-foot [[cyclops]] ambles into the light of your lamp. The cyclops is dressed in a three-piece suit of [[worsted wool]], and is wearing a black silk [[top hat|top-hat]] and cowboy boots and is carrying an [[ebony]] walking-stick. It catches sight of you and stops, seeming frozen in its tracks, with its bloodshot eye bulging in amazement and its fang-filled jaw drooping with shock. After staring at you in incredulous disbelief for a few moments, it reaches into the pocket of its vest and pulls out a small plastic bag filled with a [[Cannabis|leafy green substance]], and examines it carefully. "It must be worth eighty pazools an ounce after all" mumbles the cyclops, who casts one final look at you, shudders, and staggers away out of sight.''

====Other versions====
Other versions added their own flavour to the proceedings. 

* ''With extreme difficulty, you take down from the wall a seven foot high, twenty foot long, three hundred and sixty degree view of Mars taken from the Viking lander.'' <U+2014> from the Witt's End extension in Mike Goetz's CP/M version (1983); this action would summon Rover (see above)

* ''I am sorry, but magic rug flying regulations specifically prohibit any activity other than (a) enjoying the view (recommended), (b) reviewing one's possessions (optional) and (c) clutching rug edges in sheer stomach-churning terror (not recommended).'' <U+2014> from Mike Arnautov's 770-point version (2003)

* ''A tiny elf runs straight at you, shouts "Phuce!", and disappears into the forest.''
