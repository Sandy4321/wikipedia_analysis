'''Ashmont''' is a station on the [[rapid transit]] [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] in [[Ashmont, Massachusetts|Ashmont]], [[Dorchester (MA)|Dorchester]], [[Boston, Massachusetts]], [[USA]]. It opened on [[September 1]], [[1928]], and is the terminal for the Red Line's Dorchester Branch. Ashmont is also the terminus of the [[streetcar]] [[Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line]], which loops around on each side of the station, with platforms between the sets of tracks. Buses run southbound on the west side of the station, some running around the loop with the streetcars.

When first built, no buses served the station; all lines ran [[streetcar]]s. Specifically, the following [[Boston Elevated Railway]] streetcar lines operated to Ashmont (using post-[[1942]] numbers), unloading on the east side and loading on the two west tracks on the west side:
*{{MBTABus|22}} [[Dudley (MBTA station)|Dudley]] via Talbot Avenue
*{{MBTABus|23}} [[Dudley (MBTA station)|Dudley]] via Washington Street, Dorchester
*{{MBTABus|27}} Milton?<!--nycsubway.org says Milton but there were tracks along the 27 bus route to Mattapan-->
[[Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway]] cars to [[Brockton (MA)|Brockton]] also used the station.

Two streetcar lines serving the area west of Ashmont were [[bustituted]] soon after opening, later becoming the {{MBTABus|25}} and {{MBTABus|26}} buses. They were rerouted to Ashmont for faster access to downtown. A new busway was built on the west side of the station in [[1929]]; this has since been connected to the old streetcar ramps. The first section of the [[Mattapan High Speed Line]] (originally {{MBTABus|28}}) also opened in [[1929]], serving the easternmost track on the west side.

The Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway line converted to bus in [[1932]], using the busway. The {{MBTABus|27}} was bustituted in [[1933]], and a new route ({{MBTABus|24}}, renumbered {{MBTABus|12}} ca. [[1967]]) serving the area east of the station was also added. Additionally the Eastern Mass started running buses over what are now the {{MBTABus|215}} and {{MBTABus|217}} routes.

The ramps were paved, and in [[1949]] [[trackless trolley]]s replaced the {{MBTABus|22}} and {{MBTABus|23}} lines.

==Reconstruction==
In 2005, the MBTA awarded a $35.2 million contract for the complete reconstruction of the 75 year old Ashmont Station. As of August 2006, razing of the station is nearly complete, save a walkover that allows commuters to access the inbound platform. Construction crews will now rebuild the station from the ground up, with the completion projected in 2009. Trolley service, however, is projected to resume in 2007. Highlights of the project include:

* New platforms and a viaduct for the trolley service to Mattapan
* Two new lobbies with access at the station
* An elevated busway that is level with the new lobbies
* Public access over the subway tunnel to Peabody Square
* Three new elevators and two new escalators
* CCTV security cameras and significantly enhanced lighting
* Charlie Card automated fare vending machines and fare gates

The station construction includes of a first-of-its-kind transit oriented development (TOD) on the station site. The 116 units of mixed income housing are a represent a state, city, MBTA, community and private developer's combined effort to provide housing adjacent to rapid transit, thereby reducing automobile usage. The housing project, developed by Trinity Financial will be completed in the Spring of 2008.

==Accessibility==
The station is [[wheelchair]]-accessible.
