'''"Willie" Iam McFaul''' (born January 10, 1943 in [[Coleraine]]) is a former [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] [[Football (soccer)|football]] player and now [[Coach (sport)|coach]].

McFaul joined [[Newcastle United]] from [[Linfield F.C.]] in his native Northern Ireland in 1966 after impressing in a friendly match.

He went on to serve Newcastle as player, coach, assistant manager and then finally, in 1985, as manager.  He was sacked in October 1988 after a poor start saw early season optimism turn into an ultimately futile struggle against relegation.

His reputation was as a caring and loyal manager, who got the best out of a number of players including [[Peter Beardsley]] and [[Paul Goddard]].  His biggest contribution to the game was probably his decision to make [[Paul Gascoigne]] an integral part of the first team despite being only 18 at the time. McFaul has since managed teams in Northern Ireland and worked as the coach of the [[Guam national football team|national team of Guam]].  In Northern Ireland he managed his hometown club Coleraine who are very close to his heart.  Sadly things didn't go to plan and his spell as manager coincided with a lowly period in Coleraine very proud history.  He did, however, discover Paul Gaston, who went on to captain Coleraine and play over 600 games for the club.

McFaul is now working as a scout for [[Norwich City]], professional connections having been made with Norwich Manager [[Glenn Roeder]] during Roeder's time as [[Newcastle United]] Manager.

Many Northern Ireland fans reflect that his true ability was never fully seen at international level due to it being the [[Pat Jennings]] era.
==Newcastle United Manager==
Willie McFaul was appointed caretaker manager of [[Newcastle United FC|Newcastle United]] In [[August]] [[1985]] after [[Jack Charlton]] had resigned after a pre season friendly against [[Sheffield United FC|Sheffield United]] after a row with the Newcastle fans over the sale of [[Chris Waddle]] and the failure to sign [[Eric Gates]] from [[Ipswich Town FC|Ipswich Town]].
His first game in charge was away to [[Southampton FC|Southampton]],where he made the bold decision to make 18 year old [[Paul Gascoigne]] the playmaker of the team.By the end of [[August]] Newcastle had beaten [[Liverpool FC|Liverpool]] 1-0,a result that was good enough to earn McFaul a permanent deal as manager.[[Ian Stewart]] and [[Alan Davies]] were early signings as Newcastle made a great start to the 85-86 season by [[November]] they were In the top 6,with McFaul signing giant striker [[Billy Whitehurst]] to boost the forward line.More Impressive results followed including a 2-2 draw with champions [[Everton FC|Everton]],and a 1-1 draw at [[Anfield]] against [[Liverpool FC|Liverpool]],as well as beating [[Brian Clough]]'s [[Nottingham Forest FC|Nottingham Forest]] away 2-1,and beating [[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]] 1-0 at St James' Park with [[Glenn Roeder]] getting the winner.Newcastle finished the season in 11th,a good position for McFaul given the chaos at the start of the season when he took over as manager.
Little transfer activity over the summer of [[1986]] meant that Newcastle had a bad start to 1986-1987 season and found themselves bottom of the table In [[November]],however McFaul was given money to spend and he brought In [[Andy Thomas]] and a club record <U+00A3>400,000 on [[Paul Goddard]] from [[West Ham United FC|West Ham United]],Goddard's arrival Inspired the team to wins over [[Chelsea FC|Chelsea]], [[West Ham United FC|West Ham]] and [[Nottingham Forest FC|Nottingham Forest]].Newcastle were still bottom In March [[1987]] and they found help from Gascoigne and Goddard,with Goddard equaling a club record of scoring In 7 straight games,to finish the season In mid table with [[Aston Villa FC|Aston Villa]] and [[Manchester City FC|Man City]] amongst the clubs to be relegated.[[Peter Beardsley]] was sold to [[Liverpool FC|Liverpool]] on the eve of the 87-88 season for a British record <U+00A3>1.7M to the anger of Newcastle's fans,so McFaul signed [[Brazil]]'s flamboyant striker [[Mirandinha]] to replace Beardsley and with [[Wimbledon FC|Wimbledon]] winger [[Glyn Hodges]] coming In as well as Irish teenager [[Michael O'Neill]],Newcastle had their best season under McFaul finishing 7th,with Gascoigne taking all the plaudits winning PFA young player of the year.The summer of [[1988]] brought McFaul's biggest challenge as manager of [[Newcastle United FC|Newcastle United]],with key players [[Paul Gascoigne]], [[Neil McDonald]] and [[Paul Goddard]] all being sold for a combined fee of <U+00A3>3.7M,to the dismay of the [[Toon Army]],with huge gaps In the team McFaul went on a shooping spree buying goalkeeper [[Dave Beasant]] for <U+00A3>700,000,defender [[Andy Thorn (footballer)|Andy Thorn]] for <U+00A3>800,000,winger [[John Hendrie]] for <U+00A3>500,000 and Hearts striker [[John Robertson]] for <U+00A3>800,000.Despite Beardsley's sale Newcastle fans were In great spirits for the opening game of the season,as 3,000 travelled down to [[Goodison Park]].Newcastle lost 4-0 with [[Tony Cottee]] 
bagging a [[hat trick]],a battling 2-2 draw with [[Spurs]] seemed to of been the start for McFaul,but no wins In the next 4 matches saw his Newcastle side under severe pressure and they pulled off a great win at champions [[Liverpool FC|Liverpool]] 2-1 with [[Mirandinha]] and Hendrie scoring.A 3-0 defeat at home to [[Coventry City FC|Coventry City]] spelt the end for McFaul,who had only been given the job 3 years earlier for a couple of matches had given his all for [[Newcastle United FC|Newcastle United]].
