During the fighting, the relative strengths of the two sides was fairly even and Indian infantry clashed with Pakistani forces that were entrenched in pillboxes, dug-outs and slit trenches that had been carved into the canal banks. The Pakistanis were supported with a large number of tanks, supported by fighter jets.<ref name="sainik"/> The battle resulted in an Indian victory after they were able to capture the town on 11 September 1965.

==Background==
Pakistan launched Operation Grand Slam on 17 August 1965 in an effort to relieve infiltrators who had been surrounded after the failure of Operation Gibraltar on 15 August and to attempt to cut off the Indian supply lines.<ref name="global">{{cite web |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1965.htm|title= Indo-Pakistan War of 1965|author= |date= |work= |publisher= globalsecurity.org|accessdate=}}</ref> With supply lines under severe stress due to Operation Grand Slam, India launched an offensive towards Lahore to open up a second front in the war and distract Pakistani attention from [[Kashmir]].<ref name="global"/>  After opening the Lahore front Indian troops advanced towards Lahore along three axes<U+2014>Amritsar-Lahore, Khalra-Burki- Lahore and Khem Karan-Kasur roads<U+2014>overwhelming the small Pakistani force.<ref name="Johri_1965">{{cite book

Indian infantry, supported by the only Indian armored division, quickly pushed back unprepared Pakistani defenders with the aim of encircling and possibly besieging Lahore. Due to the element of surprise India was able to capture a large amount of Pakistani territory from the town of Khalra, an Indian border town which lies on a straight road to Lahore through Burki.<ref name="sainik"/><ref name="Gupta_1965"/> In the meantime, the Pakistani Army mobilized the troops in the region and mounted a three-pronged counterattack to recapture lost ground. The Battle of Burki was subsequently fought on Khalra-Burki- Lahore road.<ref name="sainik"/><ref name="Johri_1965"/>

==Importance==
Pakistan's main goal was to force the Indian infantry into retreat before their armored support and supply lines could catch up. The Pakistani Army's aim also was to capture much of the territory it had lost earlier in the fighting.<ref name="Gupta_1965"/> The Indian infantry's aim was to capture and hold the town of Burki untill reinforcements, including armor and supplies, could arrive.<ref name="Gupta_1965"/><ref name="Major_1965"/>

==Battle==
India began their advance from Khalra under Major-General Har Krishan Sibal and tank operations under Lieutenant-Colonel Anant Singh with a village called Jahman being the first major Pakistani outpost to fall.<ref name="Gupta_1965"/> Pakistani troops pulled back towards the next major town, which was Burki, leaving small pockets of resistance at each village to slow down Indian advance.<ref name="Saxena_1965">{{cite book

On 8 September Pakistan began the counter attack with Pakistani artillery pounding the Indian advance on 8, 9 and 10 September.<ref name="Gupta_1965"/> This constant shelling slowed down the Indian advance but was unable to stop it completely.<ref name="Gupta_1965"/> This was followed by a counterattack by Pakistani armor consisting of considerable part of Pakistan's 1st Armored Division.<ref name="Major_1965"/> Indian infantry eventually clashed with Pakistani tanks at Burki, which resulted in most of the Pakistani armor being mauled by 10 September.<ref name="sainik"/> 

The Indian infantry were able to hold off the Pakistani armored onslaught untill Indian tanks from 18th Cavalry Regiment arrived. They were then able to  subsequently launch the main assault on 10 September with armor support. As most of the Pakistani tanks had already been destroyed, the Pakistani defenders had little armored support from the remaining tanks. A few Pakistani fighter jets were called in to provide air cover for Pakistani troops and to target Indian positions.<ref name="Singh_1965"/> However, the use of fighters against ground troops instead of bombers, and the use of mounted machine guns and ground [[strafing]] instead of bombs and missiles meant that little was achieved through air support.<ref name="Singh_1965"/> The limited numbed of jets and the easy availability of trench and defensive structures for cover added to the ineffectiveness of Pakistani air operations. As a result, after intense fighting Indian infantry captured Burki on 11 September and held it through out the rest of the war despite the use of defensive structures like trenches and pillboxes as well as anti-tank weapons by Pakistani defenders during the defence of Burki.<ref name="Major_1965"/>

==Aftermath==
After the capture of Burki, the Indian advance continued towards Dograi, a town in the immediate vicinity of Lahore. They subsequently went on to capture Dograi on 20 September, thus bringing the main city of Lahore within range of Indian tank fire.<ref name="Britannica_1965">{{cite book

The Pakistani commander, Major [[Raja Aziz Bhatti]], was later awarded the [[Nishan-e-Haider]], the highest military decoration given by Pakistan, posthumously. Each year he is honored in Pakistan on 6 September, which is also known as Defence Day.<ref name="Om_1965">{{cite book
