'''Kathryn Sloan (Katy) Clark'''<ref>http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U45727/</ref> (born 3 July 1967) is a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician and former [[trade union]] official, who has been the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[North Ayrshire and Arran (UK Parliament constituency)|North Ayrshire and Arran]] since [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005]].

==Early life==
She went to Ayr Grammar Primary School, then [[Kyle Academy]], both in [[Ayr]]. Clark was educated at the [[University of Aberdeen]], receiving an [[Bachelor of Laws|LLB]] in 1990. She was the chairwoman of the Labour club there. She received a [[Common Professional Examination|Diploma in Legal Practice]] from the University of Edinburgh in 1991. She is a [[solicitor]], in [[Edinburgh]] and [[Musselburgh]] from 1991-8, turned legal officer with [[UNISON]] in London, from 1998-2005. She joined the Labour Party at the age of seventeen and is a member of the [[Transport and General Workers' Union|TGWU]] and UNISON. Her great-great grandfather, former coal-miner [[Alexander Sloan]], was Labour MP for [[South Ayrshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Ayrshire]] from 1939 until his death in 1946.

==Parliamentary career==
She unsuccessfully contested the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] seat of [[Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Galloway and Upper Nithsdale]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], a traditional [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) marginal. She finished in third place, but the main story there being that the [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]] [[Ian Lang]] had lost his seat to the SNP's [[Alasdair Morgan]]. 

She was elected to the House of Commons at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]] for the new seat of North Ayrshire and Arran, based substantially on the former seat of Cunninghame North whose MP, [[Brian Wilson (Labour politician)|Brian Wilson]] had retired, and the towns of Stevenston and Kilwinning from the old Cunninghame South. She had a majority of 11,296, and made her [[maiden speech]] on 7 June 2005.[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050607/debtext/50607-15.htm#50607-15_spnew6]

She was nominated for House Magazine's 'Maiden Speech of the Year'.

Following the election, ''[[The Guardian]]'' named her as one of eight new MPs "to watch". One of the few stridently left-wing members of Labour's 2005 intake of MPs, she is a member of the [[Socialist Campaign Group]] and the [[Scottish Labour Party Campaign for Socialism]]; of the twenty-four members of the Campaign Group, she is the only one under the age of 50. Clark quickly established a reputation as a rebel within the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]], voting against [[ID cards]]. However, she does not consider herself to be a rebel, stating that her "views are consistent with Labour's traditions".[http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1588476,00.html]

Since being elected she has campaigned against the contracting out of lifeline ferry services in her constituency and for employment and retraining for workers at the Simclar factory in her constituency after the factory closed.  She has campaigned consistently on human rights issues and was one of 95 Labour MPs who opposed replacing Britain's Trident nuclear weapons system.

She supported a 'No' vote in the [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|2011 AV Referendum]].<ref>http://labour.no2av.org/labour-mps-lords-say-no-to-alternative-vote/</ref>
