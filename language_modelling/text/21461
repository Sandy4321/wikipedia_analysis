A church has been on the site since at least 1180, but the current structure dates from the [[15th Century]], though there have been several restorations in the intervening period.<ref name=info/> Formerly a [[spire]]d church, St. Peter's now has a [[bell tower]] which, like the rest of the building, is mainly covered in [[flint]].<ref name=info/> The interior of the church features paintings by [[George Frederick Bodley]] and Robert Cardinal,<ref name=shs/> and  a [[pipe organ]] originally made by [[Lewis & Co|T.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Lewis]].

==History==
The earliest documentary record of the church is in 1180, when it was a [[chapel of ease]] to St Gregory's church.<ref name=info>{{Citation | last = Hollinshead| first = Liz| author-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 2003| title = St Peter's Church, Sudbury, Suffolk: Information for Teachers| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = London| place = | publisher = [[Churches Conservation Trust]]| pages = | page = | format = | id = | isbn = | doi = | oclc = | url = http://www.visitchurches.org.uk/uploads/publications/57.pdf| accessdate =4&nbsp;March 2011}}</ref>  The church was built in three stages, beginning with the first two [[bay (architecture)|bays]] of the [[chancel]] and the base of the tower in about 1330<U+2013>48.  The later stages of building were in about 1360, and in about 1425<U+2013>50.  In 1643, during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], the [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]] [[William Dowsing]] damaged many of the items in the church.  A restoration took place in 1685, which included some alterations to the [[nave]] roof.<ref name=shs/>  A clock was installed in 1701, and during the first half of the 18th&nbsp;century a spire of metal and wood was added; this was replaced by another spire in 1810.<ref name=info/>  The church was restored again in 1858<U+2013>59 by [[William Butterfield]]; this included removal of the three galleries and the [[box pew]]s, re-laying the chancel floor, and replacement of the [[pulpit]].  Stained glass made by [[Hardman & Co.]] was installed in some of the windows, and more stained glass by Hardman was installed later in the century.<ref name=shs/>

In 1898 the chancel was restored and redecorated by [[George Frederick Bodley]].<ref name=shs/>  A wooden [[reredos]] was installed in the [[Lady Chapel]].<ref name=info/>  The stonework of the exterior was restored in 1911, when statues were inserted into three [[niche (architecture)|niches]] in the south porch.  A further restoration took place in 1968 when the upper part of the tower was replaced, the spire was taken down, and most of Bodley's paintings were removed from the chancel.  The church was declared redundant in 1972, and in 1976 was [[vesting|vested]] in the Redundant Churches Fund, the forerunner of the Churches Conservation Trust. A [[charitable trust]], The Friends of St. Peter's has been established to maintain and improve the church.<ref name=shs/>  Since being made redundant, the church has been used occasionally for services, and for a variety of events, including concerts, organ recitals and exhibitions.<ref name=info/><ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.achurchnearyou.com/sudbury-st-gregory/| title = Sudbury, St Gregory| accessdate = 5&nbsp;March 2011| publisher = [[Church of England]]}}</ref>

==Architecture==
===Exterior===
The church is constructed mainly in [[flint]], with some stone, brick and tiles.  Its plan is not quite rectangular, as it had to be confined into a limited space.  The northwest corner is cut across, and the chancel is not fully in alignment with the nave.  The plan consists of a six-bay nave with a [[clerestory]], north and south [[aisle]]s, a two-bay chancel with the organ chamber and [[vestry]] to the north and the Lady Chapel to the south, and an extended [[sanctuary#Sanctuary as a sacred place|sanctuary]] to the east, and a west tower incorporated in the body of the church.<ref name=info/> Its architectural styles are [[Decorated Gothic|Decorated]] and [[Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]]. The tower is in three stages with angle [[buttress]]es.  Its [[parapet]] consists of stepped [[battlement]]s, and at the corners are statues rather than [[pinnacle]]s.<ref name=shs/>  The aisles also have battlemented parapets, and there are more buttresses around the church.  The main entrance to the church is through the west door at the base of the tower.  Formerly the main entrance was through the south porch.<ref name=info/>  The three statues on the exterior of the porch represent Christ, with [[Saint&nbsp;Peter]] on one side and [[Pope Gregory I|Saint&nbsp;Gregory]] on the other.<ref name=shs/>

===Interior===
The [[arcade (architecture)|arcades]] are in six bays, the [[pier (architecture)|piers]] on the north arcade differing from those on the south.  The roof is [[ceiling|ceiled]] and divided into panels, with [[gilding|gilt]] [[boss (architecture)|bosses]] at the intersections.  It is the only [[Middle Ages|medieval]] nave roof in Suffolk to be ceiled and panelled in its original form.<ref name=shs/>  Some of Bodley's painting remains on the chancel arch.  In the south aisle is the octagonal 15th-century [[baptismal font|font]].  This was removed from the church in the 17th&nbsp;century to be used as a [[Watering trough|horse trough]], but was returned to the church when the horses refused to drink from it.<ref name=shs/>  In the chancel the [[reredos]] designed by Bodley measures {{convert|20|ft|m|1}} high by {{convert|7|ft|m|1}} wide, and depicts the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]].  On the sides of the chancel are 15th-century screens.  In the Lady Chapel the font is carved with a depiction of the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]], and the reredos is a copy of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Last Supper]].  Over the north and south doors are paintings of [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]].  These were painted by Robert Cardinall, and formerly hung in a position flanking the reredos at the east end of the church.<ref name=shs/>  The [[lectern]], [[pulpit]] and altar are [[Victorian era|Victorian]], as is the stained glass.<ref name=info/>  The three-[[manual (music)|manual]] organ was built in 1911 by [[Lewis & Co|T.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Lewis]].  It was renovated in 1942 by [[Henry Willis & Sons]], and rebuilt in 1987 by Bishop.  A major rebuild was carried out by [[J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd]] in 1999.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://npor.rcm.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=G00482 | title = Suffolk, Sudbury, St. Peter (G00482)| accessdate = 5&nbsp;March 2011| publisher = [[British Institute of Organ Studies]]}}</ref>  The [[ring of bells|ring]] consists of ten bells, the oldest three being cast in about 1470, and the most recent two in 1978.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=Sudbury%2C+S+Peter&Submit=+Go+&DoveID=SUDBURYSP| title = Sudbury, S Peter| accessdate = 5&nbsp;March 2011| publisher = [[Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers]]}}</ref>
