'''Cannon Mountain''' (formerly '''Profile Mountain''') is a 4,100 foot (1,250 m) peak in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] of [[New Hampshire]].  Known for both its technical rock and ice climbing (particularly on Cannon Cliff, pictured) and its skiing (the [[state ownership|state-owned]] [[Cannon Mountain Ski Area]]), the mountain was home to the [[Old Man of the Mountain]] until the formation collapsed on May 3, 2003.  It is the parent mountain of three mountains, with heights of 3,693, 3,700, and 3,769 feet (1,125, 1,127 and 1,148 m), collectively known as "[[The Cannon Balls]]." The mountain is a type of geological formation known as an [[Exfoliation (geology)|exfoliating]] [[granite dome]] which is layered like an onion. Cannon Mountain is located within [[Franconia Notch State Park]].

==History==
[[Image:Cannon Mountain NH.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cannon Mountain as viewed from Mount Liberty in June 2005.]]
In 1972, the US Board on Geographic Names officially changed the name from "Profile Mountain," which it had been called officially since 1917, to "Cannon Mountain."  The two names both are derived from natural rock formations featured on the mountain; the former being the famous "Old Man of the Mountain" and the latter being a series of boulders which, when viewed from the foot of the mountain, resemble an antique [[cannon]]. Before being called Profile Mountain, the mountain was also called '''Frank Mountain'''.

Cannon's ski area is one of the oldest in North America. Trails had been cut on the mountain prior to [[1933 in sports|1933]], but the mountain gained widespread recognition that year when the Taft Slalom was cut as the first racing trail in North America. The mountain gained lift service with the construction of the first [[aerial tramway]] in North America, in [[1938 in sports|1938]].  A new tram was erected in [[1980]] with a vertical ascent of <span style="white-space:nowrap">2,022&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(616.3&nbsp;m)</span> and a capacity of 140 people (two seventy-person cabins), roughly three times larger than the original lift.  

Cannon hosted the first Alpine Skiing World Cup races ever held in North America in 1967, with races being listed as occurring at Franconia.

The old tram base- and summit-stations remain intact, and one of the old cabins serves as the entranceway to the [[New England Ski Museum]], opened in [[1982]] at the mountain's base area.  The museum houses what it calls "the most extensive collection of historical ski equipment, clothing, film, photographs, literature, and artwork in the East" and is one of four museums in the U.S. to be recognized by the United States Ski Association as a Regional Museum.

The summit of Cannon Mountain is home to a UHF Amateur Radio repeater on 449.875Mhz as well as two repeaters of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WMUR-TV]].

==Recreation and tourism==
Cannon Mountain and the surrounding base area are used year-round for a variety of recreational purposes, including sports such as  [[hiking]], [[climbing]] and [[skiing]], as well as being a popular tourist destination.  
===Hiking===
There are a number of trails that criss-cross Cannon Mountain and the surrounding region (a map can be found [http://nhparks.state.nh.us/uploads/pdf/franconia-notch-hiking-map.pdf here]), but only one trail, the Kinsman Ridge Trail, can be taken un-interrupted from the trailhead to the summit.  This trail begins in the Aerial Tramway parking lot and ascends the north face of the mountain, which is shared by the ski area.  Two other features of the mountain which attract hikers are the [[Appalachian Trail]] and the [[Appalachian Mountain Club]]-maintained [[High Huts of the White Mountains#Lonesome Lake Hut|Lonesome Lake Hut]]. The base of the cliff face can be approached via an ambiguous path up the right side of the talus field.

===Climbing===

[[Image:CannonMountain-BlackDike.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Cannon's most prominent ice climb. The Black Dike]]
Cannon Cliff (pictured above) is the largest vertical rock face in the Northeast at roughly 1,000 feet (300 m) in height and more than a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) long.  As written in a [http://www.summitpost.org description] of climbing possibilities on Cannon, "Some of the [[aid climbing|aid]] lines are long and difficult enough to require a [[bivouac sack|bivy]], making Cannon the only Big Wall in the northeast."  Cannon is popular both in the summer months with [[free climbing|free-]] and aid-climbers alike, and in the winter it attracts both [[ice climbing|ice climbers]] and mixed climbers (climbers who ascend routes with some pitches of ice and some pitches of rock).  There is a log book climbers are asked to sign into and out of. If an unusual amount of time passes before a climber signs out, a search party is formed. Several guide books exist for Cannon and [[Franconia Notch]], most notably 'Secrets of the Notch' by Jon Sykes which covers both rock
and ice routes.
Notable rock climbing routes:
*Whitney-Gilman Ridge: [[Climbing#Grading|5.7]], 5 pitches.  This prominent [[ar<U+00EA>te]] in the center of the face is possibly Cannon's signature climb.  The 3rd pitch (the 'Pipe Pitch') features outstanding exposure over the Black Dike.  Protection is a mix of trad and fixed bolts and pitons. First ascent Bradley Gilman & Hassler Whitney August 3, 1929
*Moby Grape: 5.8, 9 pitches.  Ascends the tallest section of the cliff.  Starts with Reppy's Crack; superb climbing all the way up. First ascent Joe Cote & Roger Martin July 1972
Notable ice climbing routes:
*The Black Dike: 4+/5-, <span style="white-space:nowrap">500&nbsp;ft&nbsp;(150&nbsp;m)</span> tall;3 pitches. A popular mixed ice climb.  First ascent John Bouchard December 18, 1971 ([[Solo climbing|solo]])
*Omega: 5+, 3 pitches. Mixed climbing. Hardest ice climb in the region. First ascent John Bouchard & Rainsford Rouner 1976

===Skiing===
The [[Cannon Mountain Ski Area]] is state-owned and offers nine lifts servicing <span style="white-space:nowrap">165&nbsp;acres&nbsp;(0.7&nbsp;km<U+00B2>)</span> of skiing (158 with snowmaking).  In the 1930s, the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] cut 6 ski trails, many of which were later incorporated into the Cannon Mountain Ski Area and, until 1984, the [http://www.nelsap.org/nh/mittersill.html Mittersill Ski Area].  The Mittersill Ski Area and Taft CCC Ski Trail were incorporated into the Cannon Mountain Ski Area in 2009.

===Tourism===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cannontram.jpg|thumb|The Cannon Mountain Tramway]] -->
Cannon has a number of non-sport related features which make it a popular tourist attraction.  The aerial tramway operates year round, and in the summer is the only way up the mountain other than hiking.  Though the lift terminates at the summit of the ski area, which is not the peak of the mountain itself, two hiking trails (the Cannon Mountain Short Trail and the Rim Trail) provide a way to the summit. The tramway opens for the summer season in mid-May and closes in mid-October, which is open daily from 9am to 5pm. There, an observation tower provides a panoramic view of the [[White Mountains Region]].  A restaurant and gift shop are available at the summit tramway station.  Another attraction until the spring of [[2003]] was the Old Man of the Mountain; However, the "Old Man of the Mountain Historic Site" remains an attraction.  Also notable is [[Profile Lake]], a lake popular with both [[fly fishing|fly fisherman]] and [[angling|anglers]]. Lastly, the [[New England Ski Museum]] attracts skiers to the area in the off-season, as well.
