'''Acindynus''' was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] governor of Carrhae ([[Harran]]), active in the reign of Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] (r. 582<U+2013>602). He was accused of being a [[Paganism|pagan]] and was executed. The main sources about him are [[Syriac language|Syriac chronicles]], in particular the ''Chronicle'' of [[Michael the Syrian]] and the [[Chronicle of 1234]].<ref name="PLRE">{{harvnb|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|pp=10<U+2013>11}}.</ref> The source of both accounts was the lost chronicle of [[Dionysius Telmaharensis]].<ref name="Syriac">{{harvnb|Palmer|Brock|Hoyland|1993|pp=114<U+2013>115 (including footnotes)}}.</ref>

==Biography==
Acindynus was reportedly a governor of Carrhae ([[Harran]]) in [[Osroene]]. The term used, "[[Hegemony|hegemon]]", typically implies a civil governor, but the civil governors of Osroene were usually stationed at [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]. Acindynus was likely a military commander stationed in the secondary city.<ref name="PLRE"/>

The Syriac accounts agree that Emperor Maurice himself authorized Stephen, Bishop of Harran, to persecute the [[Paganism|pagans]] of his area. During the persecution, the accused were given a choice between a [[forced conversion]] to [[Christianity]] and death. Acindynus was known to be a Christian, but his scribe/secretary Iyarios (elsewhere called Honorius)
accused him of secretly practicing paganism.<ref name="PLRE"/><ref name="Syriac">{{harvnb|Palmer|Brock|Hoyland|1993|pp=114<U+2013>115 (including footnotes)}}.</ref>

Stephen proceeded to have Acindynus executed, either by [[impalement]] or [[crucifixion]]. The deceased governor was succeeded by Iyarios.<ref name="PLRE"/><ref name="Syriac"/>

==Iyarios==
[[Michael the Syrian]] offers some additional information on Iyarios. According to his account, Iyarios was an [[orphan]] abandoned by his parents. He believed the birthplace of the man to be in [[Roman Armenia|Armenia Prima]] (First Armenia). Iyarios was raised and educated in the vicinity of [[Nicopolis (Pontus)|Nicopolis]], trained to be a [[scribe]].<ref name="Syriac"/>

==Interpretation==
The events can be dated to circa 589. John Liebeschuetz connects the narrative to a wave of religious persecutions which started in 578. Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527<U+2013>565) had initiated the search for [[Crypto-Paganism|crypto-pagans]] among the ranks of the [[Christians]]. But the enforcement of his laws on the subject was "spasmodic". In other words, sudden bursts of activity in persecuting pagans alternated with periods where nobody was actively seeking suspects. In 578, the Byzantine authorities had received reports on an impending revolt of crypto-pagans in [[Baalbek]]. Theophilus, an official who had previously faced revolts by [[Jewish<U+2013>Roman wars|Jews]] and [[Samaritan Revolts|Samaritans]], was tasked with locating said crypto-pagans. Suspects were arrested, interrogated under [[torture]], and forced to name other "pagans". Soon, Theophilus had lists of names, including prominent citizens spread throughout the eastern provinces of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The persecution spread to the rest of these provinces.<ref name="City">{{harvnb|Liebeschuetz|2001|pp=263<U+2013>265 (including footnotes)}}.</ref>

Theophilus himself had visited Edessa in the course of his investigations. He claimed to have interrupted a sacrifice to [[Zeus]] taking place within the city. He proceeded to arrest [[Anatolius (Osroene)|Anatolius]] and Theodore, respectively the provincial governor of Osroene and his second-in-command. They were transported first to [[Antioch]] for their interrogation and secondly to [[Constantinople]] for their trial. Liebeschuetz sees these activities as a regular "witch-hunt", where everyone is a suspect. He points that many of the "pagans" executed were probably actual Christians.<ref name="City"/>

Liebeschuetz and other modern historians point to the involvement of the [[Monophysitism|Monophysites]] in these events. The last reign favorable to them was that of Emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] (r. 491<U+2013>518). Since 518, they were seen as [[heretics]], with "their churches and monasteries ... liable to be confiscated, and their bishops to be exiled and imprisoned". Yet, they participated enthusiastically in the search for crypto-pagans. They were probably seeing it as an opportunity to discredit their enemies, since many of the "suspects" happened to be prominent [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonians]]. For example, [[Gregory of Antioch|Gregory, Patriarch of Antioch]] (term 571<U+2013>593) was accused of participating in a [[human sacrifice]].<ref name="City"/>
