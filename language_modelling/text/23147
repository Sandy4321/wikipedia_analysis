'''Air Anglia''' was a wholly privately owned, independent<ref group=nb>independent from [[government-owned corporation]]s</ref> [[United Kingdom|British]] [[regional airline]] formed at [[Norwich International Airport|Norwich Airport]] in 1970. Created as a result of a merger of three smaller operators, the new [[entity]] became an important regional scheduled carrier during the 1970s, serving the Eastern half of Britain.<ref name="AQ_explained">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1973/1973%20-%200577.html "The forgotten schedules?"], ''Flight International'', 8 March 1973, p. 331</ref> In 1980 Air Anglia merged with three regional rivals to form [[Air UK]].

==History==
[[File:Air Anglia F-28-1000.jpg|thumb|[[Fokker F-27|Fokker F-28-1000 Fellowship]] in 1978]]
Air Anglia was the result of a three-way [[merger]] in 1970 between Anglian Air Charter, Norfolk Airways and Rig Air, three local [[air taxi]] operators based in the East of [[England]].<ref name="AQ_explained"/> The new airline established its corporate headquarters as well as its main operating and engineering base at the recently established airport at  [[Norwich]] in [[East Anglia]]. At the time of formation [[Norwich Union]] became its controlling shareholder.<ref name="AQ_explained"/>

Air Anglia established itself as an important regional scheduled operator, as well as one of the main [[fixed wing]] operators supporting the [[oil and gas industry in the United Kingdom|British oil and gas industry]] in the [[North Sea]] during the 1970s.<ref name="AQ_explained"/> 

In 1980 Air Anglia merged with [[British Island Airways]] (BIA), Air Wales and Air Westward to form Air UK, at the time the UK's biggest [[regional airline]] and its third-largest scheduled operator.<ref name="AirUK_successor">{{cite |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%203893.html |title=Air UK is Air Anglia and BIA successor |journal=[[Flight International]] |date=27 October 1979 |page=1343}}</ref>

===Commercial developments===
Air Anglia commenced operations with a small fleet of Douglas DC-3 "Dakota" [[piston]]-engined airliners (see heading image) as well as a number of smaller, "executive" type of aircraft inherited from its predecessors. With these aircraft it mainly operated oil and gas industry support flights from Norwich and [[Aberdeen]] as well as [[Humberside|Humberside Airport]].

In 1971 it started internal services from Norwich to Liverpool Dublin, Newcastle, Manchester, Edinburgh and Aberdeen.

In 1974 Air Anglia added a pair of [[Fokker F-27 Friendship]] [[turboprop]]s to its fleet. The introduction of these turboprops into the airline's fleet coincided with the launch of the company's first year-round scheduled services from its Norwich base to Aberdeen via Humberside and [[Teesside]] as well as from Norwich to [[Amsterdam]]. The scheduled services between Norwich, Humberside, Teesside and Aberdeen allowed Air Anglia to commercially exploit the regular positioning flights it had been operating between these points since its inception. Oil and gas industry related [[business travel]]lers constituted a high proportion of this traffic.<ref name="AQ_explained"/> The launch of Air Anglia's first international scheduled service to Amsterdam also led to the conclusion of a joint [[marketing]] agreement with [[Netherlands|Dutch]] flag carrier [[KLM]], at the time the biggest resident operator and dominant scheduled airline at Amsterdam's [[Schiphol Airport]]. Under this agreement KLM agreed to host Air Anglia's new Norwich<U+2014>Amsterdam scheduled service, as well as any subsequently launched scheduled services linking regional UK airports not served by the KLM group with Amsterdam Schiphol, in its [[computer reservation system|reservations computer]]. This gave travel agents worldwide instant access to Air Anglia's connecting flights to/from Amsterdam via KLM's Global Distribution System, thereby enabling Air Anglia to improve its passenger loads on these services as well as helping KLM to boost its long-haul loads by delivering it additional transfer traffic from the UK regions to its Schiphol base.

In addition to these year-round scheduled services, Air Anglia also operated seasonal, summer only scheduled services from Norwich, Humberside and Aberdeen to [[Jersey]]. Air Anglia's seasonal Aberdeen<U+2014>Jersey scheduled service was the longest non-stop scheduled operation using a turboprop aircraft in the [[British Isles]] at the time; the F27's scheduled flight time on that route was 2 hours and 45 minutes.

[[File:Air Anglia F-27-200 Friendship.jpg|thumb|[[Fokker F27 Friendship|Fokker F-27-200 Friendship]] in 1978]]
The addition of further Fokker "Friendship" turboprops to the airline's fleet over the coming years led to the introduction of year-round scheduled services from [[Aberdeen]], [[Edinburgh]], Humberside and [[Leeds Bradford International Airport|Leeds/Bradford]] to Amsterdam, as well as from Edinburgh via Leeds to [[Paris Orly Airport|Paris Orly]] and from Aberdeen to [[Stavanger]] and [[Bergen]].

During the second half of the 1970s Air Anglia also added a pair of Piper PA-31 "Navajo Chieftain" executive aircraft to its fleet. One of these aircraft was used to launch a new, year round "cross-country" scheduled service linking the airline's Norwich base with [[Newquay]] in [[Southwest England]] via [[Birmingham]] in the [[English Midlands]] and [[Swansea]] in [[Wales]].

In 1979 Air Anglia launched a year-round scheduled service linking [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] with Leeds and extended its domestic year-round scheduled services to [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]] as well. 1979 also saw the introduction of the first [[jet aircraft]] into Air Anglia's fleet, when the airline inaugurated daily, year-round scheduled [[jet aircraft|jet]] operations between Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Amsterdam as well as between Aberdeen, [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Paris]], and Edinburgh, Leeds and Paris with a pair of brand-new [[Fokker F28 Fellowship]] 4000 series aircraft.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%201876.html "Air Anglia introduces its first F.28-4000", ''Flight International'', 2 June 1979, p. 1794</ref><ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%202757.html "Short hauls ... Air Anglia ..."], ''Flight International'', 28 July 1979, p. 247</ref><ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1978/1978%20-%201659.html "Britain's first F.28 in service"] ''Flight International'', 26 August 1978, p. 603</ref>

At the time of Air Anglia's merger with BIA, Air Wales and Air Westward to form Air UK in January 1980 its core fleet consisted of two Fokker F28 "Fellowship" jets and ten Fokker F27 "Friendship" turboprops. This core fleet was supplemented with additional turboprop capacity temporarily leased in from other operators such as [[BMI (airline)|British Midland]] during the annual summer peak travelling season, as well as during periods when its own fleet was undergoing maintenance.

Air Anglia hoped that the merger with BIA as well as Air Wales and Air Westward to form Air UK would help improve the merged entity's competitive position vis-<U+00E0>-vis its rivals by giving it a bigger network covering all parts of the UK, which would result from combining Air Anglia's year-round scheduled services linking important oil and gas industry centres in the Eastern half of Britain with BIA's scheduled operations across the Western half of the British Isles. This, in turn, would result in a significant marketing advantage over its rivals. Air Anglia also hoped that this would ultimately translate into a better financial performance as well by enabling the new airline to take advantage of the resulting greater [[economies of scale]], which would permit it to spread its [[fixed costs]] over a greater level of activity. In addition, Air Anglia's amalgamation with BIA, a wholly owned [[subsidiary]] of [[British and Commonwealth Holdings|British and Commonwealth]] (B&C), presented an opportunity for Norwich Union to sell its shareholding in Air Anglia to B&C.<ref name="AirUK_successor"/>
