The '''White-headed Capuchin''' (''Cebus capucinus''), also known as the '''White-faced Capuchin''' or '''White-throated Capuchin''', is a medium-sized [[New World monkey]] of the family [[Cebidae]], subfamily [[Cebinae]]. Native to the forests of [[Central America]] and the extreme north-western portion of [[South America]], White-throated Capuchins are important to [[rainforest]] ecology by their role in dispersing seeds and [[pollen]].

Among the best known [[monkey]]s, the White-headed Capuchin is recognized as the typical companion to the [[organ grinder]]. In recent years the species has become popular in [[North America]]n media. It is a highly intelligent monkey and has been trained to assist for [[paraplegic]] persons.

It is a medium-sized monkey, weighing up to {{convert|3.9|kg|lb|lk=on|abbr=on}}.  It is mostly black, but with a pink face and white on much of the front part of the body, giving it its common name.  It has a distinctive [[prehensile]] tail that is often carried coiled up and is used to help support the monkey when it is feeding beneath a branch.

In the wild, White-headed Capuchins are versatile, living in many different types of forest, and eating many different types of food, including fruit, other plant material, [[invertebrate]]s, and small [[vertebrate]]s.  They live in groups that can exceed 20 animals and include both males and females.  They are noted for their tool use, including rubbing plants over their fur in an apparent use of [[herbal medicine]], and also using tools as weapons and for getting to food.  They are long-lived monkeys, with a maximum recorded age of over 54 years.


==Description==
Like other monkeys in the genus ''[[Cebus]]'', the White-headed Capuchin is named after the order of [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin friars]]: the [[cowl]]s worn by these friars closely resemble the monkey's head coloration.<ref>{{cite web|title=Capuchin Franciscans|url=http://capuchinfranciscans.org/sub_faq.html|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref><ref name=costa>{{cite book|title=The Natural History of Costa Rican Mammals|author=Wainwright, M.|year=2002|page=135<U+2013>139|isbn=0-9705678-1-2}}</ref>  The White-headed Capuchin has mostly black fur, with white to yellowish fur on the neck, throat, chest, shoulders, and upper arms.<ref name=field>{{cite book|title=Neotropical Rainforest Mammals A Field Guide|edition=Second Edition|author=Emmons, L.|page=130<U+2013>131|year=1997|isbn=0-226-20721-8}}</ref>  The face is pink.<ref name=field/>  A V-shaped area of black fur on the crown of the head is distinctive.<ref name=field/><ref name=pic>{{cite book|title=The Pictorial Guide to the Living Primates|aithor=Rowe, N.|page=95|year=1996|isbn=0-9648825-0-7}}</ref>  It has a [[prehensile]] tail that is often held coiled, giving the White-headed Capuchin the nickname "ringtail".<ref>{{cite web|title=Medical Dictionary Capuchin Monkey|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Capuchin+(monkey)|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:White-faced capuchin monkey 4.jpeg|thumb|right|White-headed Capuchin in [[Manuel Antonio National Park]], [[Costa Rica]]]]

The White-headed Capuchin is found in much of [[Central America]] and a small portion of [[South America]].  In [[Central America]], its range includes much of [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]].<ref name=tax>{{cite book|title=New Perspectives in the Study of Mesoamerican Primates|chapter=Taxonomy and Distributions of Mesoamerican Primates|author=Rylands, A., Groves, C., Mittermeier, R., Cortes-Ortiz, L., and Hines, J.|year=2006|page=40<U+2013>43|isbn=0-387-25854-X}}</ref>  It has also been reported to occur in eastern [[Guatemala]] and southern [[Belize]], but these reports are unconfirmed.<ref name=tax/>  In South America the White-headed Capuchin is found in the extreme north-western strip between the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Andes Mountains]] in [[Colombia]] and northwestern [[Ecuador]].<ref name=tax/>

They are found in many different types of forest, including mature and secondary forests, and including evergreen and deciduous forests, dry and moist forests, and [[mangrove]] and [[montane]] forests.<ref name=field/><ref name=henderson>{{cite book|title=Field Guide to the Wildlife of Costa Rica|author=Henderson, C.|year=2000|page=454<U+2013>455|isbn=0-292-73459-X}}</ref>  But they appear to prefer [[primary forest|primary]] or advanced [[secondary forest]]s.<ref name=colombia/> And higher densities of White-headed Capuchins appear to be found in older areas of forest and in areas containing evergreen forest, as well as areas with more water availability during the dry season.<ref>{{cite book | author = DeGama, H. and Fedigan, L. | editor = Estrada, A.; Garber, P.A.; Pavelka, M.S.M.; Luecke, L. | chapter = The Effects of Forest Fragment Age, Isolation, Size, Habitat Type, and Water Availability on Monkey Density in a Tropical Dry Forest | title = New Perspectives in the Study of Mesoamerican Primates| page = 165<U+2013>186 | isbn=978-0-387-25854-6 | year = 2006}}</ref>


The White-headed Capuchin is among the most commonly seen monkeys in Central America's national parks, such as [[Manuel Antonio National Park]], [[Corcovado National Park]], [[Santa Rosa National Park]] and [[Soberania National Park]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Watching Wildlife Central America|author=Hunter, L. & Andrew, D.|year=2002|page=97, 100, 110, 130|isbn=1-86450-034-4}}</ref>

==Behaviour==

===Social Structure===
The White-headed Capuchin is a [[diurnal animal|diurnal]] and [[arboreal]] animal.<ref name=field/>  It moves primarily by walking on all four limbs.<ref>{{cite book|title=New Perspectives in the Study of Mesoamerican Primates|chapter=Ontogenetic Influences on Positional Behavior in ''Cebus'' and ''Alouatta''|author=Bezanson, L.|year=2006|page=333<U+2013>344|isbn=0-387-25854-X}}</ref>  It forms troops of up to 24 monkeys with more females than males.<ref name=field/>  On average there are 0.71 males for every female.<ref name=perspective/>  The average troop size is 16 monkeys.<ref name=perspective/>[[Image:Cebus capucinus, Costa Rica.JPG|thumb|left|250px|White-headed Capuchin walking on four limbs]]

The troop is led by a dominant male and female.<ref name=costa/>  The females are generally related, as females tyically remain in their natal troop for life.<ref name=perspective/>  Although the males are not necessarily related to each other, they are less competitive with each other than South American capuchin monkeys and they associate with each other and cooperate with each other to drive away predators.<ref name=costa/>  This may because, unlike in South American capuchins, the dominant male in the troop does not necessarily dominate breeding.<ref name=costa/>  Troop males tend to emigrate to new troops together.<ref name=perspective/>  Male emigration to a new troop typically occurs about every 4 years.<ref name=tax2>{{cite book|title=New Perspectives in the Study of Mesoamerican Primates|chapter=Dominance and Reproductive Success in Wild White-Faced Capuchins|author=Jack, K. and Fedigan, L.|year=2006|page=367<U+2013>382|isbn=0-387-25854-X}}</ref>

White-headed Capucin troops occupy home ranges of between {{convert|32|and|86|ha|acre|abbr=off|lk=on}} square metres.<ref name=pic/>  They  cover between {{convert|1|and|3|km|mi|abbr=off|lk=on}} daily, averaging {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=off|lk=on}} per day.<ref name=colombia>{{cite book|title=Primates of Colombia|author=Defler, T.|page=237<U+2013>235|year=2004|isbn=1-881-17383-6}}</ref>  Although they engage in activity that has been described as "territorial", more recent research indicates that White-headed Capuchin groups tend to behave aggressively to other conspecific groups regardless of where they meet, and that the aggression is not necessarily intended to exclude the conspecifics from a specific home range.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Capuchin|chapter=Behavioral Ecology|author=Fragaszy, D., Visalberghi, E., & Fedigan, L.|year=2004|page=38<U+2013>39|isbn=0521667682}}</ref> 

Grooming pervades social interaction.  Lower ranking animals are more likely to groom higher ranking animals than vice versa.<ref name=groom>{{cite book|title=The Complete Capuchin|chapter=Social Interactions, Relationships and Social Structure|author=Fragaszy, D., Visalberghi, E., & Fedigan, L.|year=2004|page=202<U+2013>220|isbn=0521667682}}</ref> Females do more grooming than males, and groom other females more than they grrom males.<ref name=groom/>  Females associate closely among themselves.<ref name=groom/>  When non-group males attempt to supplant the existing group males, the females generally keep themselves and their infants away from any resulting fighting.<ref name=groom/>  However, the females sometimes form "coalitions" to attempt to help repel the intruders.<ref name=groom/>

White-headed Capuchins sometimes interact with other sympatric monkey species.  White-headed Capuchins sometimes travel with and even groom [[Geoffroy's Spider Monkey]]s.<ref name=pic/><ref name=colombia/>  However, aggressive interactions between the capuchins and spider monkeys also occur.<ref name=interact>{{cite journal|title=Interspecific Interactions between ''Cebus capucinus'' and other Species: Data from Three Costa Rican Sites|author=Rose, L., Perry, S., Panger, M., Jack, K., Manson, J., Gros-Louis, J., and Mackinnin, K.|journal=International Journal of Primatology|volume=24|issue=4|date=August 2003|url=http://people.ucsc.edu/~evogel/cv/Roseetal2003.pdf|pages=780<U+2013>785}}</ref>   Interactions between the White-headed Capuchin and [[Mantled Howler]] are infrequent, and sometimes result in the capuchins threatening the larger howlers.<ref name=colombia/>  However, affiliative associations between the capuchins and howlers do sometimes occur, mostly involving juveniles playing together.<ref name=interact/>  

Although South American species of capuchins often travel with and feed together with [[squirrel monkey]]s, the White-headed Capuchin only rarely associates with the [[Central American Squirrel Monkey]].<ref name=perspective/><ref name=move>{{cite book|title=On the Move|chapter=Social Manipulation Within and Between Troops Mediates Primate Group Movement|author=Boinski, S.|editor=Boinski, S. and Garber, P.|page=447<U+2013>448|year=2000|isbn=0-226-06340-2}}</ref>  This may be because the distribution of food in the areas where Central American Squirrel Monkeys occur and is such that the cost to the squirrel monkeys of associating with the capuchins in lost feeding opportunities would not offset the benefit to the squirrel monkeys in predator detection.<ref name=perspective/><ref name=move/>  The minimal dietary overlap between the White-headed Capuchin and Central American Squirrel Monkey may also contribute to the minimal interaction.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Capuchin|chapter=Community Ecology|author=Fragaszy, D., Visalberghi, E., & Fedigan, L.|year=2004|page=70|isbn=0521667682}}</ref>

Several non-primate animal species tend to follow groups of White-faced Monkeys or are otherwise attracted by their presence.  [[White-lipped Peccary|White-lipped Peccaries]] and [[Common Agouti]]s are attracted by feeding White-headed Capuchins, looking for fruit that the capuchins drop.<ref name=colombia/>  Several species of bird are also known to follow White-headed Capuchins looking for food.  These include the [[Double-toothed Kite]], the [[White Hawk]] and the [[Sharp-shinned Hawk]].<ref name=colombia/>

[[Image:White-faced Capuchin Monkey 2.jpeg|thumb|right|White-headed Capuchin foraging in the trees]]

===Diet===
White-headed Capuchins are [[omnivore]]s with varied diets.  Their primary foods are fruit and insects.<ref name=costa/>  They forage at all levels of the forest, and also forage on the ground.<ref name=colombia/>  The [[prehensile]] tail assists with feeding, helping support the monkey when foraging for food below the branches.<ref name=colombia/>

Fruit can make up between 1/2 and 2/3 of the capuchins' diet.  In one study in [[Panama]] they were noted eating 95 different fruit species.<ref name=costa/>  They generally only eat the ripe fruit, testing for ripeness by smelling, tasting and prodding the fruit.<ref name=costa/>  They typically eat only the pulp and juice, spitting out the seeds and fibers.<ref name=costa/>  Other plant matter eaten includes flowers, young leaves, seeds of certain plants, and [[bromeliad]]s.<ref name=costa/><ref>{{cite book|title=New Perspectives in the Study of Mesoamerican Primates|chapter=Food Choice by Juevenile Capuchin Monkeys|author=MacKinnon, K.|year=2006|page=354<U+2013>360|isbn=0-387-25854-X}}</ref>  They also drink water that gets trapped in the bromeliads.<ref name=costa/>  

Insect prey eaten includes beetle larvae, butterfly and moth [[caterpillar]]s, ants, wasps, and ant and wasp larvae.<ref name=costa/>  They also eat larger prey.  Such prey includes birds, bird eggs, frogs, lizards, crabs, [[mollusk]]s and small mammals.<ref name=costa/><ref name=life>{{cite video|title=[[Life of Mammals]]|people=[[David Attenborough]]|year2=2003|publisher=BBC Video}}</ref>  The population in [[Guanacaste]], [[Costa Rica]] in particular is noted for hunting [[squirrel]]s, [[magpie]]s, [[White-crowned Parrot]]s and baby [[coati]]s.<ref name=costa/>  The amount of [[vertebrate]] prey eaten varies by troop.<ref name=costa/>

===Tool use===
Capuchins are considered among the most intelligent of the New World monkeys; they have been the subject of many behavioural and intelligence studies. The capuchins' intelligence is thought to be a result of their feeding habits; they rely on ephemeral food sources which may be hard to find. In one particular study conducted in 2007, capuchins were found to be among the ten most intelligent primates, second to [[spider monkey]]s among New World monkeys.<ref name=intelligence>{{cite web|title=Chimps Knocked Off Top of the IQ Tree|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1654998.ece|author=Leake, D. & Dobson, R.|date=April 15, 2007|year=2007|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref>
 
The White-headed Capuchin is known to rub parts of certain plants into their fur.  Plants used in this manner include [[citrus]] fruits, vines of the genera ''[[Piper]]'' and ''[[Clematis]]'', monkey comb (genus ''[[Sloanea]]''), [[dumb cane]] and [[custard apple]].<ref name=costa/><ref name=life/>  Ants and [[millipede]]s are also used in this way.<ref name=costa/>  It is not definitively known what this fur rubbing is for.  But this may deter [[parasite]]s such as [[tick]]s and [[insect]]s, or it may serve as a [[fungicide]] or [[bactericide]] or [[anti-inflammatory]] agent.<ref name=costa/>  Alternatively, it may be a form of scent marking.<ref name=costa/>  

White-headed Capuchins also use tools in other ways.  They have been known to beat snakes with sticks in order to protect themselves or to get them to release an infant.<ref name=costa/>  In captivity, they have been known to use tools to get to food or to defend themselves, and in one case a White-headed Capuchin used a squirrel monkey as a projectile, hurling it at a human observer.<ref name=costa/>  Some populations also use trees or other hard surfaces as [[anvil]]s in order to crack [[mollusk]]s.<ref name=life/>

The White-headed Capuchin's intelligence and ability to use tools allows them to be trained to assist [[paraplegic]]s.<ref name=bronx>{{cite web|title=Bronx Zoo: Monkey House - White-throated Capuchin|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/469410855/|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref>  Other species of [[capuchin monkey]] are also trained in this manner.<ref>{{Citation|title=Monkeys as Helpers To Quadriplegics At Home |author=Blumenthal, D.|year=1987|date=1987-06-17|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>  White-headed Capuchins can also be trained for roles on [[television]] and [[movies]], such as Marcel on the television series ''[[Friends]]''<ref name=bronx/>  They were also traditionally used as [[organ grinder]] monkeys.<ref name=henderson/>

[[Image:White-faced capuchin monkey 6.jpeg|thumb|right|White-headed Capuchin Facial Expression]]

===Communication===
The White-headed Capuchin is characterised as being noisy.<ref name=field/>  Loud calls, such as barks and coughs, are used to [[animal communication|communicate]] threat warnings, and softer calls, such as squeals, are used in intimate discourse.<ref name=costa/>  Facial expressions and scent are also important to communication.<ref name=groom/>  They sometimes engage in a practice known as "urine washing", in which a monkey rubs urine on its feet.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Capuchin|chapter=The Body|author=Fragaszy, D., Visalberghi, E., & Fedigan, L.|year=2004|page=102|isbn=0521667682}}</ref>  The exact purpose of this practice is unknown, but it may be a form of [[olfactory]] signal.<ref name=groom/>

==Reproduction==

White-headed Capuchins use a [[polygamy|polygamous]] mating system in which a male may mate with multiple females.<ref name=colombia/>  Although the dominant male does not monopolize breeding, studies have shown that the dominant male does tend to father most of the young.<ref name=tax2>  This may be because the dominant male is more likely to copulate when the female is at peak fertility.<ref>{{cite book|title=New Perspectives in the Study of Mesoamerican Primates|chapter=Post-conceptive Mating in White-Faced Capuchins|author=Carnegie, S., Fedigan, L., and Ziegler, T.|year=2006|page=387<U+2013>405|isbn=0-387-25854-X}}</ref>

[[Copulation]] takes about 2 minutes.<ref name=colombia/>  [[Gestation]] period is 5 to 6 months.<ref name=colombia/>  Usually a single young is born, but twins occur occasionally.  Most births occur during the dry season from December to April.<ref name=pic/><ref name=colombia/>

The infant is carried across its mother's back for about 6 weeks.<ref name=colombia/>  After about 7 to 8 weeks it can stray from its mother for brief periods.<ref name=colombia/>  By about 6 months it can move around independently.<ref name=colombia/>  [[Weaning]] occurs between 6 and 12 months.  Females give birth every 26 months, on average.<ref name=perspective/>  While the mother rests, the young spands most of its time playing, either on its own or with other juveniles.<ref name=colombia/>

Like other capuchin species, White-headed Capuchins mature slowly.  Sexual maturity can be reached at 3 years.<ref name=henderson/>  But on average, females give birth for the first time at 7 years old.<ref name=perspective/>  Males attain reproductive maturity at 10 years old.<ref name=perspective/>  White-headed Capuchins can also have long life spans given their size.  Maximum recorded life span in  captivity is over 54 years.<ref name=perspective/>

==Conservation status==

The White-headed Capuchin is regarded as "least concern" from a conservation standpoint by [[IUCN]].  However, their numbers are impacted by the fact that they are sometimes captured as pets.<ref name=costa/>  Their status can also be harmed by [[deforestation]].  However, deforestation may impact their main predator, the [[Harpy Eagle]], more than it directly impacts the White-headed Capuchin, and so on a net basis deforestation may not be as harmful to the capuchin's status.<ref name=costa/>  White-headed Capuchin can adapt to forest fragmentation better than other species due to their ability to live in a wide variety of forest types and exploit a wide variety of food sources.<ref>{{cite book|title=New Perspectives in the Study of Mesoamerican Primates|chapter=Concluding Comments and Conservation Priorities|author=Garber, P., Estrada, A., and Pavelka, M.|year=2006|page=570<U+2013>571|isbn=0-387-25854-X}}</ref>  White-headed Capuchins are important to their ecosystems for a number of reasons, but especially on their capacity as seed and [[pollen]] dispersers.<ref name=costa/><ref name=henderson/>

==Taxonomy==
The White-headed Capuchin was one of the many species originally described by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his 18th century work, ''[[Systema Naturae]]''.<ref>{{la icon}} {{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

[[Image:White-faced Capuchin 1.jpeg|thumb|left|Some authorities consider this a member of the subspecies ''Cebus capucinus imitator'']]

Some authorities believe that there are three subspecies of White-headed Capuchin, based on small differences in appearance:<ref name=tax/>
* ''C. c. capucinus'', from the southern part of the range in [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]] and eastern [[Panama]]
* ''C. c. imitator'', from most of [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]] and western [[Panama]]
* ''C. c. limitaneus'', from [[Honduras]] and northern [[Nicaragua]]

However, other authorities do not recognize any separate subspecies, and regard ''C. c. imitator'' and ''C. c. limitaneus'' as synonyms of ''C. capucinus''.<ref name=msw3/>
