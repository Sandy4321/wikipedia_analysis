{{animal testing}}
'''The People's Petition''' was an [[online]] campaign to express support for [[Animal testing|medical experimentation using animals]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Within a year of launch the number of signatures exceeded 21,850 and included [[Tony Blair]], the then serving  [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].

== Purpose ==
Launched on [[20 April]], [[2006]] by the [[Coalition for Medical Progress]], a broad alliance that includes [[pharmaceutical companies]] and research agencies, the [[petition]] was proposed by a member of the public to represent the "[[silent majority]] who accept the need for animal studies". [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4923402.stm] David Taylor stated that, as neither a [[scientist]] nor doctor, he wanted a way "to show people who carry out [[medical research]] that I value and support their work." [http://www.thepeoplespetition.org.uk/aboutthissite/]

The petition offered the opportunity for individuals of any age or place of residence to express support for three assertions:
* Medical research is essential for developing safe and effective medical and veterinary treatments, requiring some studies using animals.
* Where there is no alternative available, medical research using animals should continue in the UK.
* People involved in medical research using animals have a right to work and live without fear of intimidation or attack.

== Response ==
By [[13 May]], the petition had recorded 13,000 signatures. The following day, in the wake of publicity around a number of acts of intimidation by [[animal rights]] activists, then British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced in the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'', that he intends to add his name to the petition. As an unusual move for a serving [[politician]], Blair described his intention as "a sign of just how important I believe it is that as many people as possible stand up against the tiny group of [[extremists]] threatening medical research and advances in [the UK]." [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=033OSJ0HAFW4JQFIQMFCFF4AVCBQYIV0?xml=/news/2006/05/14/nrights214.xml]

Animal rights groups criticised Blair's actions; the [[National Anti-Vivisection Society]] calling it "hugely irresponsible". The [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] praised Blair's stance in tackling extremists, but expressed concern that he was "blindly backing the animal experimenters" practising "outmoded science". [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uklatest/story/0,,-5821478,00.html]

Blair's announcement also drew praise, however. [[Jean-Pierre Garnier]], chief executive of [[GlaxoSmithKline]], stated he was encouraged by Blair's "personal commitment" and [[Colin Blakemore]], chief executive of the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]], thanked Blair "on behalf of medical researchers, who live in fear of such intimidation."

Other notable signatories include [[Caroline Flint]] and [[Tom Brake]], both [[Member of Parliament|MPs]], and [[Polly Toynbee]]. As of the end of 2006, the number of signatures exceeded 21,850.
