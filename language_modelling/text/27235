'''Hurricane Betsy''' was an intense and destructive [[tropical cyclone]] that brought widespread damage to areas of [[Florida]] and the central [[United States Gulf Coast]] in September&nbsp;1965. The storm's erratic nature, coupled with its intensity, minimized preparation time and contributed in making Betsy the first tropical cyclone in the [[Atlantic hurricane|Atlantic basin]] to accrue at least $1&nbsp;billion in damage.{{#tag:ref|All monetary figures are in 1965&nbsp;[[United States dollar]]s unless otherwise noted.|group="nb"}} While the storm primarily affected areas of southern Florida and [[Louisiana]], lesser effects were felt in [[The Bahamas]] and as far inland in the [[United States]] as the [[Ohio River Valley]]. Betsy began as a [[tropical depression]] north of [[French Guiana]] on August&nbsp;27, and strengthened as it moved in a general northwestwardly direction. After executing a slight [[anticyclonic rotation|anticyclonic loop]] north of the Bahamas, Betsy proceeded to move through areas of [[South Florida]] on September&nbsp;8, causing extensive crop damage. After emerging into the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the cyclone strengthened and reached its peak intensity equivalent to that of a [[Category 4 hurricane]] on September&nbsp;10 before making its final [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near [[Grand Isle, Louisiana]] shortly thereafter. Once inland, Betsy was slow to weaken, and persisted for two more days before degenerating into an [[extratropical storm]]; these remnants lasted until September&nbsp;13.

As a developing tropical cyclone, Betsy tracked over the northern [[Leeward Island]]s, producing moderate gusts and slight rainfall, though only minimal damage was reported. After tracking over open waters for several days, Betsy had significantly strengthened upon moving through the Bahamas. There, considerable damage occurred, particularly to crops on the archipelago's islands. For the island chain, Betsy was considered the worst hurricane since a [[1929 Bahamas hurricane|tropical cyclone]] impacted the region in [[1929 Atlantic hurricane season|1929]]. Widespread [[power outage]] and property damage ensued due to the storm's strong winds. Overall, damage on the Bahamas amounted to at least $14&nbsp;million, and one fatality occurred. From there Betsy tracked westward and made landfall on [[South Florida|southern Florida]], where it was considered the worst tropical cyclone since a [[1926 Miami hurricane|hurricane in 1926]]. Betsy's strong [[storm surge]] inundated large portions of the [[Florida Keys]], flooding streets and causing widespread damage. The only route out of the Keys onto the mainland was cut off by the storm. In the state alone, Betsy caused $139&nbsp;million in damage and five deaths.

Further inland, effects wrought by Betsy were considerably weaker, though precipitation caused by the storm extended as far northeast as [[Pennsylvania]]. Rainfall was primarily beneficial in [[Arkansas]], though localized flooding impacted [[rice]] and [[cotton]] crops. In [[Kentucky]] and [[Illinois]], strong winds caused moderate property damage. By the time the remnants of Betsy moved into the northeastern United States, the storm's winds and rainfall had substantially lessened, and as such resulting wind damage was negligible while precipitation benefited crops. In total, the damage wrought by Betsy throughout its existence equated to roughly $1.42&nbsp;billion, making it the [[list of costliest Atlantic hurricanes|costliest Atlantic hurricane]] until it was surpassed by [[Hurricane Camille]] four years later. In addition the hurricane caused 81&nbsp;deaths, primarily in Louisiana. After the season, the [[National Weather Service|United States Weather Bureau]] retired the [[tropical cyclone naming|name]] Betsy from their [[list of tropical cyclone names|rotating lists of tropical cyclone names]].

After Betsy stalled and assumed a southwesterly course towards southern Florida, precautionary measures ceased in the Carolinas but were initiated in Florida and The Bahamas. [[Mackey Airlines]] assisted in the evacuation of 227&nbsp;residents of West End Island to Miami, [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], and [[West Palm Beach, Florida]], over the course of three flights. Three additional [[Douglas DC-10]] airliners from Mackey Airlines evacuated 240&nbsp;people, primarily American tourists, from [[Nassau County, Florida|Nassau]] to Miami. Various commercial flights between the archipelago and Florida were cancelled due to the impending storm.

Betsy also drove a [[storm surge]] into [[Lake Pontchartrain]], just north of New Orleans, and the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a deep-water shipping channel to the east and south. Levees for the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet along Florida Avenue in the [[Lower Ninth Ward]] and on both sides of the Industrial Canal failed. The flood water reached the [[eaves]] of houses in some places and over some one story roofs in the Lower Ninth Ward. Some residents drowned in their attics trying to escape the rising waters.

These levee breaches flooded parts of [[Gentilly, New Orleans|Gentilly]], the [[Ninth Ward of New Orleans#Upper 9th Ward|Upper Ninth Ward]], and the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans as well as [[Arabi, Louisiana|Arabi]] and [[Chalmette, Louisiana|Chalmette]] in neighboring St. Bernard Parish. President [[Lyndon Johnson]] visited the city, promising New Orleans Mayor [[Vic Schiro]] federal aid.

It was ten days or more before the water level in New Orleans went down enough for people to return to their homes. It took even longer than that to restore their flooded houses to a livable condition. Those who did not have family or friends with dry homes had to sleep in the shelters at night and forage for supplies during the day, while waiting for the federal government to provide emergency relief in the form of trailers. In all, 164,000 homes were flooded at the second landfall.

Evidence suggests that cheap construction and poor maintenance of the structures led to the failure of the levees. However, popular rumor persists that they were intentionally breached, possibly as a means of salvaging the more prosperous [[French Quarter]].<ref>{{cite news

Many of the barges that had been traveling on the Mississippi River were engulfed by the hurricane. One of the barges contained 602 tons of deadly chlorine gas contained in cylinders. Chlorine gas, which was used frequently as a [[Chemical weapons in World War I|chemical weapon in World War I]], is a powerful irritant that can inflict damage to the eyes, nose, throat and lungs, and (at high concentrations and prolonged exposure) cause death by asphyxiation. It was estimated that the amount of chlorine loaded on the barge was enough to kill 40,000 people. The barge had sunk near [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], where an estimated 300,000 people lived. The residents in the harbor area were evacuated until the barge was recovered. President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered the Navy and Army Engineers to find and raise the barge. While it took months to locate and make the appropriate plans for raising the barge, the actual process of raising it took around two hours. The barge was reportedly recovered, without any problems, on November 18, 1965.<ref>{{cite news|title=Disaster Averted in Louisiana|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9lEpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wGYFAAAAIBAJ&dq=hurricane%20chlorine-gas%20barge%20tons&pg=1794%2C5406505|accessdate=20 September 2013|newspaper=The Lewiston Daily Sun|date=18 November 1965}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
{{See also|Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans}}
The [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]]' Hurricane Protection Program came into existence as a result of Betsy. The Corps built new levees for New Orleans that were both taller and made of stronger material, designed specifically to resist a fast-moving Category&nbsp;3 hurricane like Betsy. The resulting levee improvements failed when [[Hurricane Katrina]], a large, slow-moving, intense hurricane made landfall near [[New Orleans]] on August 29, 2005.
