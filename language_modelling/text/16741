'''''Brachychiton rupestris''''', [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''narrow-leaved bottle tree''' or '''Queensland bottle tree''', is a tree in the family [[Malvaceae]] native to [[Queensland, Australia|Queensland]], [[Australia]]. Discovered and [[Species description|described]] by Sir [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]] and [[John Lindley]] in 1848, it gains its name from its bulbous trunk, which can be up to {{convert|3.5|m|ft}} [[diameter at breast height]] (DBH). Reaching {{convert|10|<U+2013>|25|m|ft}} high, the Queensland bottle tree is [[deciduous]], losing its leaves briefly between September and December. The leaves are simple or divided, with one or more narrow leaf blades up to {{convert|11|cm|in|sigfig=1}} long and {{convert|2|cm|in|sigfig=1}} wide. The cream flowers appear from September to November, and are followed by the woody boat-shaped follicles, which are ripe from November to May. No subspecies are recognised. 

As a drought-deciduous [[Succulent plant|succulent]] tree, ''Brachychiton rupestris'' adapts readily to cultivation and is tolerant of a range of various soils  and temperatures. It is a key component and emergent tree in the endangered central semi-evergreen vine thickets<U+2014>also known as bottletree scrub<U+2014>of Queensland [[Brigalow Belt]]. Remnant trees are often left by farmers on cleared land for their value as shade and fodder trees.

==Description==
''Brachychiton rupestris'' grows as a [[Succulent plant|succulent]] tree reaching {{convert|10|<U+2013>|20|m|ft}} (rarely {{convert|25|m|ft}}) in height,<ref name="Guymer 1988"/> though plants in cultivation are usually shorter.<ref name=Cheung>{{cite web|author=Cheung, Puiyee |title=Brachychiton rupestris|work=Growing Native Plants|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens and Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research, Canberra.|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/gnp/interns-2005/brachychiton-rupestris.html|accessdate=2 December 2014}}</ref> The thick trunk is {{convert|5|<U+2013>|15|m|ft}} tall, with a {{convert|1|<U+2013>|3.5|m|ft}} [[diameter at breast height]] (DBH). It has dark grey bark and is marked by shallow [[Tessellation#In_nature|tessellation]] and deeper fissures. Smaller branches are light green or grey, as are the trunks of immature trees. Like those of all members of the genus, the leaves are [[phyllotaxis|alternately arranged]] along the stems.<ref name="Guymer 1988"/> 

''Brachychiton rupestris'' is [[deciduous]]. Trees in their native habitat are typically leafless between September and December; however the timing, duration and extent of leaf drop may be affected by extremes of rainfall or drought.<ref name="Guymer 1988"/> Sometimes trees shed leaves from only some branches.<ref name="kapitany">{{cite book|last=Kapitany|first=Attila|title=Australian Succulent Plants|publisher=Kapitany Concepts|location=Boronia, Victoria|date=2007|pages=214-16|isbn=0-646-46381-0}}</ref> On every tree the leaves vary in shape, ranging from narrow and elliptic to deeply divided.<ref name="Rowell 1980"/> The upper surface is glossy, contrasting with a pale undersurface. The adult leaf blades are {{convert|4|<U+2013>|11|cm|in}} long and {{convert|0.8|<U+2013>|2|cm|in|sigfig=1}} wide with pointed ([[wikt:acuminate|acuminate]] or [[wikt:apiculate|apiculate]]) tips. They have a raised [[wikt:midrib|midrib]] on the upper and lower surface, with 12-25 pairs of lateral veins that are more prominent on the upper surface, arising at 50-60 degrees from the midrib. The compound [[heteroblasty (botany)|juvenile leaves]] have 3-9 spear-shaped (lanceolate) or linear lobes. These each measure {{convert|4|<U+2013>|14|cm|in}} long and {{convert|0.3|<U+2013>|1|cm|in|sigfig=1}} wide.<ref name="Guymer 1988"/>

[[Panicle]]s of creamy-yellow flowers with red markings<ref name="Rowell 1980">{{cite book|author=Rowell, Raymond J.| title=Ornamental Flowering Trees in Australia| publisher=AH & AW Reed Pty Ltd|location= Wellington, New Zealand | year=1980 |pages=59| isbn=058950178X}}</ref> appear from September to November in the  species' native range. These arise from [[axillary bud]]s on end branches. Each panicle contains 10-30 flowers and is {{convert|3|<U+2013>|8|cm|in}} long. Each flower is {{convert|0.5|<U+2013>|1|cm|in|sigfig=1}} long and {{convert|1.3|<U+2013>|1.8|cm|in|sigfig=1}} wide. The length of the lobes of the [[perianth]] are more than half the perianth diameter.<ref name="Guymer 1988"/> Like all ''Brachychiton'' species, ''B. rupestris'' is [[Plant_reproductive_morphology#Terminology|monoecious]]<U+2014>each plant has distinct male and female flowers.<ref name="Guymer 1988"/> Male flowers have 15 [[stamen]]s, with pale yellow [[Stamen#Morphology_and_terminology|anthers]], while female flowers have cream or white [[Stigma (botany)|stigmas]] surrounded by rudimentary stellate (star-shaped) [[Gynoecium|carpels]], which sit atop the ovaries.<ref name="Guymer 1988"/>

Groups of 3 to 5 woody boat-shaped [[Follicle (fruit)|follicles]],<ref name="Rowell 1980"/>  each containing 4 to 8 (or occasionally up to 12) seeds, develop from November to May. Smooth on the outer surface and hairy inside, the follicles split along their length to reveal the seeds, which are covered by a hairy coating known as the [[Seed#Seed_coat_2|exotesta]]. The seeds are ovoid with a smooth surface, and are {{convert|6|<U+2013>|7|mm|in}} long by {{convert|3.5|<U+2013>|4.5|mm|in}} wide.<ref name="Guymer 1988"/>

The closely related Proserpine bottle tree (''[[Brachychiton compactus]]'') that occurs only in the vicinity of the town of [[Proserpine, Queensland|Proserpine]] can be distinguished by its more oval leaves, more compact flower heads and longer ellipsoid follicles.{{sfn|Rathie|2014|p=24}} The [[Species description|undescribed]] Ormeau bottle tree has brighter lime-green new foliage and leaves otherwise similar to the Proserpine bottle tree.{{sfn|Rathie|2014|p=26}}

The species came to the attention of the scientific community when explorer [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Sir Thomas Mitchell]] observed the trees on his expedition through Queensland in 1848 and published an account in ''Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia'' in the same year. He came across them as he ascended [[Mount Abundance]] near present-day [[Roma, Queensland|Roma]], remarking that "The trunk bulged out in the middle like a barrel, to nearly twice the diameter at the ground, or of that at the first springing of the branches above.

In 1988 Gordon Guymer of the [[Queensland Herbarium]] published a taxonomic revision of ''Brachychiton''; he classified ''B. rupestris'' in the [[Section (botany)|section]] ''Delabechea'' along with the related and newly described Proserpine bottle tree.<ref name="Guymer 1988"/> A third species in the section has been recognised but not yet described from southeast Queensland.{{sfn|Rathie|2014|p=26}} Unique to section ''Delabechea'', all three species all have bulbous trunks and can have large cavities in the vertical wood [[Ground_tissue#Parenchyma|parenchyma]].{{sfn|Rathie|2014|p=24}} The genus ''Brachychiton'' lies within an Australasian [[clade]] within the subfamily [[Sterculioideae]] (previously family [[Sterculiaceae]]) in a large broadly defined [[Malvaceae]].

The name ''Brachychiton'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''brachys'', short, and ''chiton'', tunic, a reference to the loose [[seed]] coats.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Brachychiton rupestris flower 4443.jpg|thumb|Female flower]]
''Brachychiton rupestris'' is found in central Queensland from latitude 22<U+00B0> S to 28<U+00B0> S, with the western limits of its range defined by the 500&nbsp;mm rainfall [[isohyet]]. It grows on the tops and slopes of hills or ridges in low hilly country, in clay-, shale- or basalt soils. It is an emergent or dominant tree in forests dominated by brigalow (''[[Acacia harpophylla]]''), hoop pine (''[[Araucaria cunninghamii]]'') or ooline (''[[Cadellia pentastylis]]'').<ref name="Guymer 1988"/> It is always present in the Central semi-evergreen vine thicket<U+2014>also known as Bottletree Scrub<U+2014>of the [[Brigalow Belt]], while other common species include broad-leaved bottle tree (''[[Brachychiton australis]]'') and belah (''[[Casuarina cristata]]''). The bottle tree is replaced by the [[Brachychiton populneus|kurrajong]] in similar communities in New South Wales.<ref name="sprat">{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicshowcommunity.pl?id=24|title=Semi-evergreen vine thickets of the Brigalow Belt (North and South) and Nandewar Bioregions|last=Department of the Environment|date=19 February 2014|work=Threatened Species & Ecological Communities|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref>
