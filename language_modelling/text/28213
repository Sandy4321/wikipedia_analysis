[[File:Usage des Nouvelles Mesures 1800.jpg|thumb|250px|Woodcut dated 1800 illustrating the new decimal units which became the legal norm across all France on 4 November 1800]]

The origins of the [[metric system]] date back to the sixteenth century when [[Simon Stevin]] published details his [[decimal]] notation and the seventeenth century when [[John Wilkins]] published a proposal for a decimal system of measurement based on natural units. The first practical realisation of the metric system came during the [[French Revolution]] when the existing system of measure which had fallen into disrepute was replaced by a decimal system based on the [[kilogram]] and the [[metre]].  The metric system was, in the words of [[Marquis de Condorcet|Condorcet]], "for all people for all time". The unit of length, the metre was based on the dimensions of the [[earth]] and the unit of mass, the kilogram, was based on the mass of [[water]] having a [[volume]] one one [[litre]] or one thousandth of a [[cubic metre]].  Reference copies for both units were manufactured and placed in the custody of the [[Academy of Sciences (France)|Academy of Sciences]].

During the first half of the nineteenth century, the metric system was adopted by the scientific community. In the middle of the century [[James Clerk Maxwell]] put forward the concept of a coherent system where a small number of units of measure were defined as [[base units]] and all other units of measure, call [[derived units]],  were defined in terms of the base units.  Maxwell proposed three base units - length, mass and time. This concept worked well with [[Classical mechanics|mechanics]], but attempts to describe [[Lorentz force|electromagnetic force]]s in terms of these units was beset with difficulties. By the end of the nineteenth century four principal variants of the metric system were in place for the measurement of electromagnetic phenomena - three based on the [[centimetre gram second system of units|centimetre-gram-second system of units]] (CGS system) and one on the metre-kilogram-second system of units (MKS system).  This impasse was resolved by [[Giovanni Giorgi]] who in 1901 proved that a coherent system that incorporated electromagnetic units had to have an electromagnetic units as the fourth base unit.

Until 1875 the French government owned the prototype metre and kilogram, but in that year the [[Metre Convention|Convention of the metre]] was signed and control of the standards relating to mass and length passed onto a trio of inter-government organisations, the senior of which was the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (in French the ''Conf<U+00E9>rence g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale des poids et mesures'' or CGPM). During the first half of the twentieth century, the CGPM cooperated with a number of other organisations and by 1960 it had responsibility for defining temporal, electrical, thermal, molecular and luminar measurements while other international organisations continued their roles in how these units of measurement were used.

In 1960, the CGPM launched the [[International System of Units]] (in French the ''Syst<U+00E8>me international d'unit<U+00E9>s'' or SI) which had 6 base units - the metre, kilogram, [[second]], [[ampere]], [[kelvin|degree kelvin]] (subsequently renamed the "kelvin") and [[candela]] and 22 derived units.  The [[Mole (unit)|mole]] was added as a seventh base unit in 1971. During this period, the metre was redefined in terms of the [[wavelength]] of the waves from a particular light source and the [[second]] was defined in terms of the [[frequency]] of [[radiation]] from another light source.  By the end of the century work was well under way to redefine the ampere, kilogram,  mole and kelvin in terms of the basic [[Physical constant|constants of physics]], thereby ensuring that all the base units were in theory available to everybody.  It is expected that this work will be completed by 2015.

==Universal measure==
In the early ninth century, [[Charlemagne]] introduced standard units of measure for length and for mass throughout the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. As the empire disintegrated these standard diverged and by the seventeenth century there were numerous units of measure within regions and different sizes having the same name across regions. The variations were promoted by local vested interests but hindered trade and taxation.<ref name="Larousse">{{LarousseXIXe | article = M<U+00E9>trique | volume = 11 | pages = 163<U+2013>64}}.</ref><ref name="Nelson">{{citation | first = Robert A. | last = Nelson | title = Foundations of the international system of units (SI) | journal = Phys.

In 1586, the Flemish mathematician [[Simon Stevin]] published a small pamphlet called ''De Thiende'' ("the tenth").<ref name=Stevin_MacTutor>{{MacTutor|id=Stevin|date=January 2004}}</ref> Decimal fractions had been employed for the extraction of square roots some five centuries before his time, but nobody used decimal numbers in daily life. He felt that this innovation was so significant that he declared the universal introduction of decimal coinage, measures, and weights to be merely a question of time.

=== Mouton ===
In 1670, [[Gabriel Mouton]], a French abbot and scientist, proposed a decimal system of measurement based on the circumference of the Earth. His suggestion was a unit, the milliare, be defined as a minute of arc along a meridian. He then suggested a system of sub-units, dividing successively by factors of ten into the centuria, decuria, virga, virgula, decima, centesima, and millesima.<ref name = Mouton>{{MacTutor|id=Mouton|date=January 2004}}</ref> His ideas attracted interest at the time, and were supported by both [[Jean Picard]] and [[Christiaan Huygens]] in 1673,<ref>{{cite web

[[image:Nicolas de Condorcet.PNG|200px|left|thumb|Marquis de Condorcet - "The metric system is for all people for all time"]]
In 1789 the French finances were in a perilous state and in May [[Louis XVI]] summonsed the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates General]].  On 14 July 1789, the mob stormed the [[Bastille]] and in August 1789 the nobility surrendered their privileges, including the right to control local weights and measures.  Louis XVI charged a group of experts including such notables as [[Lavoisier]], [[Condorcet]], [[Laplace]], [[Borda]] and [[Legendre]] to produce the system of measures that would replace the disparate system then in place. <ref name=Adletinto/>

There was also a wish that the units of measure should be for all people and for all time and therefore not dependant on an artifact owned by any one particular nation.  [[Talleyrand]], at the prompting of the savant [[Condorcet]], approached the British and the Americans in the early 1790's with proposals of a joint effort to define the metre.

unified, natural and universal system of measurement to replace the disparate systems then in use. This group,  which produced the metric system, which was then adopted by the revolutionary government of France.

On 13 July 1790 Thomas Jefferson presented a document ''[[Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States]]'' to congress in which he advocated a decimal system that used traditional names for units (such as ten inches per foot). The report was considered but not adopted by Congress.

[[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P<U+00E9>rigord|Talleyrand]] resurrected the idea of the seconds pendulum before the Constituent Assembly in 1790, suggesting that the new measure be defined at 45<U+00B0>N (a latitude that, in France, runs just north of Bordeaux and just south of Grenoble): despite the support of the Assembly, and of Great Britain and the newly independent United States, nothing came of Talleyrand's proposal.<ref name="Larousse"/>
The French Revolution and subsequent Napoleonic Wars marked the end of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The forces of change that had been brewing manifest themselves across all of France, including the way in which units of measure should be defined.  The savants of the day favoured the use of a system of units that were inter-related and which used a decimal basis.

=== Decimal time (1793) ===
Decimal time was introduced in the decree of 5 October 1793 under which the day was divided into 10 "decimal hours", the "hour" into 100 " decimal minutes" and the "decimal minute" into 100 "decimal seconds".  The "decimal hour" corresponded to 2&nbsp;hr&nbsp;24&nbsp;min, the "decimal minute" to 1.44&nbsp;min and the "decimal second" to 0.864&nbsp;s. The revolutionary week was 10&nbsp;days, but there were still twelve months in a year.<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate = 2011-03-07}}</ref>  The use of decimal time proved very unpopular, especially the ten day week and the calendar was officially discarded by Napoleon in 1806.

=== Draft metric system (1795) ===
The implementation of decimal time proved an immense task and under the article 22 of the law of 18 Germinal, Year III (7 April 1795) , the use of decimal time was no longer mandatory.<ref>{{cite web

[[image:Obs-Paris-meridienne.jpg|200px|left|thumb|The Paris meridian which passes through the [[Observatoire de Paris]]. The metre was defined along this meridian using a survey that stretched from [[Dunkirk]] to [[Barcelona]].]]

The metric system of measure was first given a legal basis in 1795 by the [[French Revolution]]ary government.  Article 5 of the law of 18 Germinal, Year III (7 April 1795) defined five units of measure. The units and their preliminary values were:<ref>{{cite web |url= http://aviatechno.free.fr/unites/nouveausys.php

*The [[metre]], for length - defined as being one ten millionth of the distance between the [[North Pole]] and the [[Equator]] through [[Paris]]
*The [[Hectare|are]]&nbsp;(100&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) for area [of land]
*The [[st<U+00E8>re]]&nbsp;(1&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>)  for volume of firewood
*The [[litre]]&nbsp;(1&nbsp;dm<sup>3</sup>)  for volumes of liquid
*The [[gram]], for mass - defined as being the mass of one cubic centimetre of water

Decimal multiples and submultiples of these units would be defined by Greek [[SI prefix|prefixes]] - "myria", "kilo", "hecta" (100), "deka", "deci", "centi" and "milli". Using [[C<U+00E9>sar-Fran<U+00E7>ois Cassini de Thury|Cassini's]] survey of 1744, a provisional value of 443.44 ''lignes'' was assigned to the metre which, in turn, defined the other units of measure.<ref>{{cite book
|author = Adler
|page = 106}}</ref>

The final value of the metre had to wait until 1799 when Delambere and Mechain presented the results of their [[History of the metre|survey between Dunkirk and Barcelona]] which fixed the length of the metre at 443.296 ''lignes''. The law 19 Frimaire An VIII (10 December 1799) defined the metre in terms of this value and the kilogram as being 18827.15 ''grains''.  These definitions enabled reference copies of the kilograms and metres to be constructed that were to used as standards for the next 90 years.

At the same time, a new decimal-based system for [[angular measurement]] was implemented. The right angle was divided into 100 [[Grad (angle)|''grads'']] which in turn was divided in 100 ''centigrads''.  An arc on the earth<U+2019>s surface formed by an angle of one ''centigrade'' was one kilometre.  The use of the ''centigrade'' was adopted for general use in a number countries and in 1948 the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) recommended that the degree centigrade (used for the measurement of temperature) be renamed the [[Celsius|degree Celsius]].<ref>{{cite web

===Meridianal definition===
[[Image:Dunkerque Belfort.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Belfry, Dunkirk - the northern end of the meridian arc]]
The question of measurement reform was placed in the hands of the [[Academy of Sciences (France)|Academy of Sciences]] who appointed a commission chaired by [[Jean-Charles de Borda]]. Borda could be said to have been a fanatic for decimalization: he had invented the "repeating circle", a surveying instrument which allowed a much-improved precision in the measurement of angles between landmarks, but insisted that it be calibrated in "''[[grad (angle)|grades]]''" ({{frac|100}} of a quarter-circle) rather than [[degree (angle)|degree]]s, with 100&nbsp;minutes to a ''grade'' and 100&nbsp;seconds to a minute.<ref>{{citation | title = Jean Charles de Borda | url = http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Borda.html | publisher = MacTutor | accessdate = 2010-08-13}}.</ref> For Borda, the seconds pendulum was a poor choice for a standard because the second (as a unit of time) was insufficiently decimal: he preferred a system of 10&nbsp;hours to the day, 100&nbsp;minutes to the hour and 100&nbsp;seconds to the minute<U+2026>

Instead, the commission <U+2013> whose members included [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]], [[Gaspard Monge|Monge]] and [[Nicolas de Condorcet|Condorcet]] <U+2013> decided that the new measure should be equal to one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the Equator (the quadrant of the Earth's circumference), measured along the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] passing through Paris.<ref name="Larousse"/> Apart from the obvious nationalistic considerations, the [[Paris meridian]] was also a sound choice for practical scientific reasons: a portion of the quadrant from Dunkerque to Barcelona (about 1000&nbsp;km, or one-tenth of the total) could be surveyed with start- and end-points at sea level, and that portion was roughly in the middle of the quadrant, where the effects of the Earth's oblateness were expected to be the largest.<ref name="Larousse"/>

[[image:Rodez-coquelicots480.JPG|200px|thumb|left|The north and south sections of the meridianal survey met at Rodez cathederal, seen here dominating the Rodez skyline.]]
The task of surveying the [[meridian arc]] fell to [[Pierre M<U+00E9>chain]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Delambre]], and took more than six years (1792<U+2013>98).<ref>The technical difficulties were not the only problems the surveyors had to face in the convulsed period of the aftermath of the Revolution: M<U+00E9>chain and Delambre, and later [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Arago|Arago]], were imprisoned several times during their surveys, and M<U+00E9>chain died in 1804 of yellow fever, which he contracted while trying to improve his original results in northern Spain.</ref> In the meantime, the commission calculated a provisional value from older surveys of 443.44&nbsp;''[[ligne]]s''.<ref name="lignes">All values in ''lignes'' are referred to the ''[[toise de P<U+00E9>rou]]'', not to the later value in ''[[mesures usuelles]]''. 1&nbsp;''[[toise]]''&nbsp;= 6&nbsp;''[[pied]]s''; 1&nbsp;''pied''&nbsp;= 12&nbsp;''[[pouce]]s''; 1&nbsp;''pouce''&nbsp;= 12&nbsp;''lignes''; so 864&nbsp;''lignes''&nbsp;= 1&nbsp;''toise''.</ref>

The project was split into two parts - the northern section of 742.7&nbsp;km from the Belfry, [[Dunkirk]] to [[Rodez|Rodez Cathederal]] which was surveyed by Delambre and the southern section of 333.0&nbsp;km from [[Rodez]] to the [[Montju<U+00EF>c|Montju<U+00EF>c Fortress]], [[Barcelona]] which was surveyed by M<U+00E9>chain.<ref>{{cite book

Delambre used a baseline of about 10&nbsp;km in length along a straight road, located close to [[Melun]].  In an operation taking six weeks, the baseline was accurately measured using four platinum rods, each of length two ''toise'' (about 3.9&nbsp;m).<ref>{{cite book
|author = Adler
|page = 227-230}}</ref> Thereafter he used, where possible, the triangulation points used by [[C<U+00E9>sar-Fran<U+00E7>ois Cassini de Thury|Cassini]] in his 1744 survey of France. M<U+00E9>chain's baseline, of a similar length, and also on a straight section of road was in the [[Perpignan]] area.<ref>{{cite book
|author = Adler
|page = 240-241}}</ref> Although M<U+00E9>chain's sector was half the length of Delambre, it included the [[Pyrenees]] and hitherto unsurveyed parts of Spain. After the two surveyors met, each computed the other's baseline in order to cross-check their results and they then recomputed the kilometre. Their result came out at 0.144&nbsp;''lignes'' shorter than the provisional value, a difference of  about 0.03%.<ref name="Larousse"/>

===''M<U+00E8>tre des Archives''===
While M<U+00E9>chain and Delambre were completing their survey, the commission had ordered a series of [[platinum]] bars to be made based on the provisional metre. When the final result was known, the bar whose length was closest to the meridianal definition of the metre was selected and placed in the National Archives on 22&nbsp;June 1799 (4&nbsp;messidor An&nbsp;VII in the Republican calendar) as a permanent record of the result:<ref name="Larousse"/> this standard metre bar became known as the ''m<U+00E8>tre des Archives''.

The [[metric system]], that is the system of units based on the metre, was officially adopted in France on 10&nbsp;December 1799 (19&nbsp;frimaire An&nbsp;VIII) and became the sole legal system of weights and measures from 1801.

It soon became apparent that M<U+00E9>chain and Delambre's result (443.296&nbsp;''lignes'')<ref name="lignes"/> was slightly too short for the meridianal definition of the metre. [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Arago|Arago]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Biot|Biot]] extended the survey to the island of Formentera in the western Mediterranean Sea in 1806<U+2013>9, and found that one ten-millionth of the Earth's quadrant should be 443.31&nbsp;''lignes'': later work increased the value to 443.39&nbsp;''lignes''.<ref name="Larousse"/> The modern value, for the WGS&nbsp;84 reference spheroid, is {{nowrap|1.000<U+2009>196<U+2009>57}}&nbsp;m or {{nowrap|443.383<U+2009>08}}&nbsp;''lignes''.<ref>The WGS&nbsp;84 reference spheroid has a semi-major axis of {{nowrap|6<U+2009>378<U+2009>137.0 m}} and a flattening of {{frac|{{nowrap|298.257<U+2009>223<U+2009>563}}}}.</ref>

Nevertheless, the ''m<U+00E8>tre des Archives'' remained the legal and practical standard for the metre in France, even once it was known that it did not exactly correspond to the meridianal definition. When, in 1867,  it was proposed that  a new international standard metre be created, the length was taken to be that of the ''m<U+00E8>tre des Archives'' "in the state in which it shall be found".<ref name="MComm">{{citation | title = The International Metre Commission (1870-1872) | url = http://www.bipm.org/en/si/history-si/commission.html | publisher = International Bureau of Weights and Measures | accessdate = 2010-08-15}}.</ref><ref name="BIPMhist">{{citation | title = The BIPM and the evolution of the definition of the metre | url = http://www.bipm.org/en/si/history-si/evolution_metre.html | publisher = International Bureau of Weights and Measures | accessdate = 2010-08-15}}.</ref>

===''Kilogramme des Archives''===
A '''grave''' is a metallic reference standard of one thousand [[gram]]s that was used for a few years until it was replaced by the [[kilogram]] standard in 1799.

On 7 April 1795, the <U+201C>gramme<U+201D>, upon which the kilogram is based, was decreed to be equal to <U+201C>the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to a cube of one hundredth of a metre, and at the temperature of the melting ice<U+201D>.<ref>''[http://smdsi.quartier-rural.org/histoire/18germ_3.htm Decree relating to the weights and measurements]''</ref> Although this was the ''definition'' of the gram, the regulation of trade and commerce required a <U+201C>practical realisation<U+201D>: a single-piece, metallic reference standard that was one thousand times more massive that would be known as <U+201C>grave<U+201D> (symbol '''G'''). This mass unit, whose name is derived from the word <U+201C>gravity<U+201D>, was used since 1793. Notwithstanding that the ''definition'' of the base unit of mass was the gramme (alternatively <U+201C>gravet<U+201D>), this new, practical realisation would ultimately become the base unit of mass. A provisional kilogram standard was made and work was commissioned to determine precisely how massive a cubic decimetre (later to be defined as equal to one [[litre]]) of water was.

Although the decreed definition of the kilogram specified water at 0&nbsp;<U+00B0>C <U+2014> a highly stable ''temperature'' point <U+2014> the scientists tasked with producing the new practical realisation chose to redefine the standard and perform their measurements at the most stable ''density'' point: the temperature at which water reaches maximum density, which was measured at the time as 4&nbsp;<U+00B0>C.<ref>''L<U+2019>Histoire Du M<U+00E8>tre, La D<U+00E9>termination De L<U+2019>Unit<U+00E9> De Poids'', link to Web site [http://histoire.du.metre.free.fr/fr/index.htm here.]</ref> They concluded that one cubic decimetre of water at its maximum density was equal to 99.92072% of the mass of the provisional kilogram made earlier that year.<ref>''[http://www.sizes.com/units/kilogram.htm History of the kilogram]''</ref> Four years later in 1799, an all-platinum standard, the <U+201C>Kilogramme des Archives<U+201D>, was fabricated with the objective that it would equal, as close as was scientifically feasible for the day, to the mass of cubic decimetre of water at 4&nbsp;<U+00B0>C. The kilogram was defined to be equal to the mass of the Kilogramme des Archives and this standard stood for the next ninety years.

Note that the new metric system did not come into effect until after the [[French Revolution]], when the new revolutionary government captured the idea of the metric system. The decision of the Republican government to name this new unit the <U+201C>kilogramme<U+201D> had been mainly politically motivated, because the name <U+201C>grave<U+201D> was at that time considered politically incorrect as it made for too easy puns about Robespierre's activities. Moreover, it resembled the aristocratic German title of the [[Graf]], an alternative name for the title of [[Count]] that, like other nobility titles, was inconsistent with the [[Libert<U+00E9>, <U+00E9>galit<U+00E9>, fraternit<U+00E9>|new French Republic notion of equality (<U+00E9>galit<U+00E9>)]].<ref>[http://www.bipm.org/en/si/history-si/name_kg.html BIPM - the name "kilogram"]</ref> Accordingly, the ''name'' of the original, defined unit of mass, <U+201C>gramme<U+201D>, which was too small to serve as a practical realisation, was adopted and the new prefix <U+201C>kilo<U+201D> was appended to it to form the name <U+201C>kilogramme<U+201D>. Consequently, the kilogram is the only [[SI base unit]] that has an [[SI prefix]] as part of its unit name.

== Worldwide adoption of the metric system ==

During the nineteenth century the metric system proved a convenient politcal compromise during the unification processes in the Netherlands, Germany and Italy.  Spain found it expedient in 1858 to follow the French example and within a decade [[Latin America]] had also adopted the metric system. There was conisderable resistance to metrication in the United Kingdom and in the United States, though once the United Kingdom announced its metrication program in 1965, the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] followed suite.  

=== France: Mesures usuelles (1812 - 1839)===
{{main|Mesures usuelles}}
The introduction of the metric system into France in 1795 was done on a district by district basis with Paris being the first district, but it was, in terms of modern standards, poorly managed. Although thousands of pamphlets were distributed, the Agency of Weights and Measures who oversaw the introduction underestimated the work involved.  Paris alone needed 500,000 metre sticks, yet one month after the metre became the sole legal unit of measure, they only had 25,000 in store.<ref>{{cite book |author = Adler |page = 269}}</ref> This, combined with other excesses of the Revolution and the high level of illiteracy made the metric system unpopular.

Napoleon himself ridiculed the metric system, but as an able administrator, recognised the value of a sound basis for a system of measurement and under the ''d<U+00E9>cret imp<U+00E9>rial du 12 f<U+00E9>vrier 1812'' (imperial decree of 12 February 1812), a new system of measure - the ''mesure uselles'' or "customary measures" was introduced for use in small retail businesses - all government, legal and similar works still had to use the metric system and the metric system continued to be taught at all levels of education.<ref name=Fevier>{{cite web

=== The Dutch metric system ===
The Netherlands first used the metric system and then, in 1812, the [[Mesures usuelles|mesures usuelles]] when it was part of the [[French Empire]]. Under the Royal decree of 27 March 1817 (''Koningklijk besluit van den 27 Maart 1817''), the newly-formed [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] abandoned the mesures usuelles in favour of the "Dutch" [[metric system]] (''Nederlands metrisch stelsel'') in which metric units were given the names of units of measure that were then in use.  Examples include the ''ons'' (ounce) which was defined as being 100&nbsp;g:<ref>{{cite book

===The German Zollverein ===
[[image:Alter Grenzstein Pontebba 01.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Old boundary stone in Pontebba, marking the former border between Austria-Hungary and Italy; the myriametre (10&nbsp;km) was in common use in Central Europe during the mid ninteenth century<ref name=Europa1842/>]]
At the outbreak of the French Revolution, much of modern-day Germany and Austria were part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] which has become a loose federation of kingdoms, principalities, free cities, bishoprics and other fiefdoms, each with its own system of measurement, though in most cases such system were loosely derived from the [[Carolignian]] system instituted by [[Charlemagne]] a thousand years earlier.

During the Napoleonic era, there was a move among some of the German states to reform their systems of measurement using the prototype metre and kilogram as the basis of the new units. [[Baden]], in 1810, for example, redefined the ''ruthe'' (rods) as being 3.0&nbsp;m exactly and defined the subunits of the ''ruthe'' as 1 ''ruthe'' = 10&nbsp;''fu<U+03B2>'' (feet) = 100&nbsp;''zoll'' (inches) = 1,000&nbsp;''linie'' (lines) = 10,000&nbsp;''punkt'' (points) while the ''pfund'' was defined as being 500&nbsp;g, divided into 30&nbsp;loth, each of 16.67&nbsp;g.<ref>{{cite book

After the [[Congress of Vienna]] there was a degree of commercial cooperation between the various German states resulting in the setting of the German Customs Union (''[[Zollverein]]'').  There were however still many barriers to trade until [[Bavaria]] took the lead in establishing the General German Commercial Code in 1856.  As part of the code the ''Zollverein'' introduce the ''Zollpfund'' (Customs Pound) which was defined to be exactly 500&nbsp;g and which could be split into 30&nbsp;'lot'.<ref name=Zollmuseum>{{cite web

In 1806, the Italian Republic was replaced by the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] with Napoleon as its emperor. By 1812, all of Italy from Rome northwards was under the control of Napoleon, either as French Departments or as part of the Kingdom of Italy ensuring the metric system was in use throughout this region.

After the [[Congress of Vienna]], the various Italian states reverted to their original system of measurements, but in 1845 the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia | Kingdom of Piedmont and Sardinia]] passed legislation to introduce the metric system within five years. By 1860, most of Italy had been unified under the King of Sardinia [[Victor Emmanuel II]] and under ''Law 132 of 28 July 28 1861''  the metric system became the official system of measurement throughout the kingdom.  Numerous ''Tavole di ragguaglio'' (Conversion Tables) were displayed in shops until 31 December 1870.<ref name = metricItaly/>

===Spain===

Until the ascent of the [[Bourbon]] monarchy in Spain in 1700, each of the regions of Spain retained their own system of measurement. The new Bourbon monarchy tried to centralise control and with it the system of measurement.  There were debates regarding the desirablility of retaining the [[Castilian]] units of measure or, in the interests of harmonisation, adopting the French system.<ref name = metricSpain>{{cite web

===United Kingdom and the Commonwealth===

During the next eighty years a number of Parliamentary select committees recommended the adoption of the metric system each with a greater degree of urgency, but Parliament prevaricated. A Select Committee report of 1862 recommended compulsory metrication, but with an "Intermediate permissive phase", Parliament responded in 1864 by legalising metric units only for 'contracts and dealings'.<ref name = Hyttel>

In 1895 another Parliamentary select committee recommended the compulsory adoption of the metric system after a two-year permissive period, the 1897 Weights and Measures Act legalised the metric units for trade, but did not make them mandatory.<ref name = Hyttel/> A bill to make the metric system compulsory and to enable British industrial base to fight off the challenge of the nascent German base passed through the House of Lords in 1904, but fell due to a general election.

Metrication in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa was essentially complete within a decade while metrication in India and Canada is not complete.

The United States Government acquired copies of the French metre and kilogram for reference purposes in 1805 and 1820 respectively. In 1866 the [[United States Congress]] passed a bill making it lawful to use the metric system in the United States.  The bill, which was permissive rather than mandatory in nature, defined the metric system in terms of [[customary units]] rather than with reference to the international prototype metre and kilogram.<ref>{{cite web

Four of the six dissenters represented manufacturing interests and the other two the United States Revenue service.  The grounds cited were the cost and inconvenience of the change-over.  Subsequent bill suffered a similar fate.<ref name=PopularScience/>.

== Development of a coherent metric system ==
From its inception, the metric system was designed in such a manner that the various units of measure were linked to each other. At the start of the nineteenth century, length, mass and temperature were the only base units that had been standardised.  The beginnings of a coherent system were in place with the units of area and volume linked to the unit of length, though at the time science did not understand the concepts of base units and derived units, nor how many physical quantities were inter-related.

===Time, work and energy===
In 1832 [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Carl-Friedrich Gauss]] made the first absolute measurements of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] using a decimal system based using the millimetre, gram, and second as the units of measure for length, mass, and time respectively, thereby implicitly making time a base unit of the metric system.<ref name=SIbrochureHistory>{{SIbrochure8th|page=109}}</ref>
[[Image:Joule's Apparatus (Harper's Scan).png|right|thumb|Joules apparatus for measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat.  As the weight dropped,[[ potential energy]] was transferred to the water, heating it up.]]
In a paper published in 1843, [[James Prescott Joule]] first demonstrated a means of measuring the [[energy]] transferred between different systems when work is done thereby relating [[Nicolas Cl<U+00E9>ment]]'s [[calorie]], defined in 1824, to [[Work (physics)|mechanical work]].<ref>{{cite web

In 1861 a committee of the [[British Science Association|British Association for Advancement of Science]] (BAAS) including [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin)]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and Joule among its members was tasked with investigating the "Standards of Electrical Resistance".

===Electrical units===
In the 1820's [[Georg Ohm]] formulating [[Ohms Law|law]] which can be extended to relate power to current, potential difference (voltage) and resistance. During the following decades the realisation of a coherent system of units that incorporated  the measurement of electromagnetic phenomena and Ohm's law was beset with problems - at least four different systems of units were devised.  In the three CGS systems, the constants <math>k_e</math> and <math>k_m</math> and consequently <math>\epsilon_0</math> and <math>\mu_0</math> were dimensionless.

:In the 1820's [[Andr<U+00E9>-Marie Amp<U+00E8>re]] discovered a relationship between the force between two current-carrying conductors, now known as [[Amp<U+00E8>re's force law|Ampere's law]] which can be written

:In 1833 Gauss pointed out the possibility of equating this force with its mechanical equivalent. This proposal received further support from [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] in 1851. <ref name=satellite>{{cite web

:'''Electrostatic system of units'''
:In 1783 Coulomb discovered and published the relationship between the force exerted between two charged bodies.  This relationship, now known as [[Coulomb's law]] can be written
::<math>F_\mathrm{e} = k_\mathrm{e} \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}</math> where <math>k_\mathrm{e} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}</math> (SI units)

In this system unit for charge is defined by setting the [[Coulomb force constant]] (<math>k_\mathrm{e}</math>) to unity and the unit for potential difference were defined to ensure the unit of energy calculated by the relation <math> E = QV</math> is one erg.

:Using this relationship, he proposed merging the EMU and the ESU systems into one system using the EMU units for magnetic quantities (subsequently named the [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]] and [[Maxwell (unit)|maxwell]]) and ESU units elsewhere. He named this combined set of units "[[Gaussian units]]".  This set of units has been recognised as being particularly useful in theoretical physics.{{SIBrochure8th|page 128}} 


:'''Practical system of units'''
:The CGS units of measure used in scientific work were not practical when used in engineering leading to the development of the practical system of electric units.  At the time that this system of units was proposed, the dimensions of electrical resistance was modelled as the ratio of length to time (ie a velocity). The most practical unit for resistance was multiples of {{nowrap|10<sup>8</sup> m/s}} - the base unit of length was the length of the Earth's quadrant, the base unit of time the second and the base unit of mass was {{nowrap|10<sup>-11</sup> g}}, the latter having been chosen to allow conversion back to the CGS system.<ref name=Maxwell2/> The names, but not the values, [[amp]], [[volt]], [[farad]] and [[ohm]] were carried over from the CGS system. The system was adopted at the International Electrical Congress (IEC) in 1881.<ref>{{cite web
|url = http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/history.html
|title = A brief history of SI
|publisher = NIST
|accessdate = 2011-03-29}}</ref> This system was formalised as the [[International System of Electrical and Magnetic Units]] at the 1893 congress of the IEC in Chicago where the volt, amp and ohm were formally defined.  The SI units with these names are very close, but not identical to the "practical units".

===A coherent system===
The electrical units of measure did not easily fit into the coherent system using length, mass and time as its base units as proposed in the 1861 BAAS paper.  Using [[dimensional analysis]] the dimensions of charge as defined by the ESU system of units was identical to the dimensions of current as defined by the EMU system  of units <math>M^\frac{1}{2}L^\frac{3}{2}T^{-1}</math> while resistance had the same dimensions as velocity in the EMU system of units, but had the dimensions of the inverse of velocity in the ESU system of units.<ref name=Maxwell2/>
 
From mid 1890s onwards [[Giovanni Giorgi]] and [[Oliver Heaviside]] corresponded with each other regarding these anomalous resuts.<ref name=IECGiorgi>{{cite web

|title = In the beginning... Giovanni Giorgi
|year = 2011
|publisher = [[International Electrotechnical Commission]]
|accessdate = 2011-04-05}}</ref> This led to Giorgi presenting a paper to the congress of the Associazione Elettrotecnica Italiana (A.E.I.)<ref>[[:it:Associazione Elettrotecnica Italiana]] (in Italian)</ref> in October 1901 in which he showed that a coherent electro-mechanical system of units could be obtained by adding a fourth base unit of an electrical nature (ampere, volt or ohm) to the three base units proposed in the 1861 BAAS report. This gave the constants ''k<sub>e</sub>'' and ''k<sub>m</sub>'' physical dimensions and hence the electrco-mechanical quantities <U+03B5><sub>0</sub> and <U+00B5><sub>0</sub> were also given physical dimensions.<ref name=IECGiorgi/>

It took more than thirty years before Giorgi's work was accepted in practice by international organisations and nearly another thirty years before they were incorporated as the basis of the ''Syst<U+00E8>me International d'Unit<U+00E9>s'' (International System of Units), the SI.

===Naming the units of measure===
In 1861, [[Charles Bright]] and [[Latimer Clark]] proposed the names of [[ohm]], [[volt]], and [[farad]] in honour of [[Georg Ohm]], [[Alessandro Volta]] and [[Michael Faraday]] respectively for the practical units based on the centimetre-gramme-second absolute system.  This was supported by Thomson (Lord Kelvin)<ref>{{cite web

==Convention of the metre==
{{main|Metre Convention}}
[[File:Metric seal.svg|thumb|left|150px|Seal of the [[International Bureau for Weights and Measures]] (BIPM)]]
With increasing international adoption of the metre, the short-comings of the ''m<U+00E8>tre des Archives'' as a standard became ever more apparent. Countries which adopted the metre as a legal measure purchased standard metre bars that were intended to be equal in length to the ''m<U+00E8>tre des Archives'', but there was no systematic way of ensuring that the countries were actually working to the same standard. The meridianal definition, which had been intended to ensure international reproducibility, quickly proved so impractical that is was all but abandoned in favour of the artifact standards, but the ''m<U+00E8>tre des Archives'' (and most of its copies) were "end standards": such standards (bars which are exactly one metre in length) are prone to wear with use, and different standard bars could be expected to wear at different rates.<ref>{{LarousseXIXe| article = M<U+00E8>tre | volume = 17 | page = 1587}}.</ref>

The International Conference on Geodesy in 1867 called for the creation of a new, international prototype metre<ref name="MComm"/><ref name="BIPMhist"/><ref>The term "prototype" does not imply that it was the first in a series and that other standard metres would come after it: the "prototype" metre was the one that came first in the logical chain of comparisons, that is the metre to which all other standards were compared.</ref> and to arrange a system where national standards could be compared with it. The international prototype would also be a "line standard", that is the metre was defined as the distance between two lines marked on the bar, so avoiding the wear problems of end standards. The French government gave practical support to the creation of an International Metre Commission, which met in Paris in 1870 and again in 1872 with the participation of about thirty countries.<ref name="MComm"/>

On 20 May 1875 an international treaty known as the ''Convention du M<U+00E8>tre'' ([[Metre Convention]]) was signed by 17 states.<ref>Text of the treaty: {{cite web
|url = http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/metre_convention.pdf
|title = Convention du m<U+00E8>tre
|language = French
|accessdate = 2011-03-08}}</ref><ref name="Nelson"/> This treaty established the following organisations to conduct international activities relating to a uniform system for measurements:
[[Image:US National Length Meter.JPG|right|thumb|U.S. national standard of the metre, showing the bar number (#27), the Tresca cross-section and one of the lines.]]
:*[[Conf<U+00E9>rence g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale des poids et mesures]] (CGPM), an intergovernmental conference of official delegates of member nations and the supreme authority for all actions;
:*[[Comit<U+00E9> international des poids et mesures]] (CIPM), consisting of selected scientists and [[metrologist]]s, which prepares and executes the decisions of the CGPM and is responsible for the supervision of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures;
:*[[Bureau international des poids et mesures]] (BIPM), a permanent laboratory and world centre of scientific metrology, the activities of which include the establishment of the basic standards and scales of the principal physical quantities, maintenance of the international prototype standards and oversight of regular comparisons between the international prototype and the various national standards.

The international prototype metres and kilograms were both made from a 90%&nbsp;[[platinum]], 10%&nbsp;[[iridium]] alloy which is exceptionally hard and which has good electrical and thermal conductivity properties. The prototype had a special X-shaped ([[Tresca]]) cross section to minimise the effects of torsional strain during length comparisons.<ref name="Nelson"/> and the prototype kilograms were cylindrical in shape. The London firm [[Johnson Matthey]] delivered 30 prototype metres and 40 prototype kilograms. At the first meeting of the [[CGPM]] in 1889 bar No.&nbsp;6 and cylinder No.&nbsp;X were accepted as the international prototypes.  The remainder were either kept as BIPM working copies or distributed to member states as national prototypes.<ref>{{cite journal

== Twentieth century ==

At the beginning of the twentieth century, the BIPM had custody of two artifacts - one to define length and the other to define mass. Other units of measure which did not rely on specific artifacts were controlled by other bodies. In the scientific world, quantum theory was in its infantcy and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] had yet to publish his theories of relativity.  By the end of the century, a coherent system of units was in place under the control of the bodies set up by the [[Treaty of the Metre]], the definition of the second relied on quantum theory, the definition of the metre relied on the theory of relativity and plans were being made to relegate the international prototype kilogram to the archives.

=== Metre ===
The first (and only) follow-up comparison of the national standards with the international prototype metre was carried out between 1921 and 1936,<ref name="Nelson"/><ref name="BIPMhist"/> and indicated that the definition of the metre was preserved to with 0.2&nbsp;<U+00B5>m.<ref name="Barrell">{{citation

In 1887 [[Michelson]] proposed the use of optical interferometers for the measurement of length, work which contributed to him being awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1907. In 1952 the CIPM proposed the use of wavelength of a specific light source as the standard for defining length and in 1960 the CGPM accepted this proposal using radiation corresponding to a transition between specified energy levels of the krypton 86 atom as the new standard for the metre. By 1975, when the second had been defined in terms of a physical phenomena rather than the earth's rotation and Einstein's assertion that the [[speed of light]] was constant, the CGPM authorised the CIPM to investigate the use of the speed of light as the basis for the definition of the metre.  This proposal accepted in 1983.

=== Kilogram ===
[[File:Prototype mass drifts.jpg|thumb|right|399px|Mass drift over time of national prototypes {{nowrap|K21<U+2013>K40}}, plus two of the IPK<U+2019>s [[#Glossary|sister copies]]: K32 and K8(41).<ref group="Note">Prototype No. 8(41) was accidentally stamped with the number 41, but its accessories carry the proper number 8.

There is the distinct possibility that ''all'' the prototypes gained mass over 100 years and that K21, K35, K40, and the IPK simply ''gained less'' than the others.]]

Although the definition of the kilogram remained unchanged throughout the twentieth century, the 3rd CGPM in 1901 clarified that the kilogram was a unit of [[mass]], not of [[weight]]. The original batch of 40 prototypes (adopted in 1889) were supplemented from time to time with further prototypes for use by new signatories to the [[Metre Convention]].<ref>{{cite journal

During the course of the century, the various national prototypes of the kilogram were recalibrated against the international prototype and therefore against each other. The initial 1889 starting-value offsets of the national prototypes relative to the IPK were nulled.<ref name="Girard">{{Cite journal |title=The Third Periodic Verification of National Prototypes of the Kilogram (1988<U+2013>1992) |author=G.{{nbsp}}Girard |journal=Metrologia |volume=31 |issue=4 |year=1994 |pages=317<U+2013>336 |doi=10.1088/0026-1394/31/4/007|bibcode = 1994Metro..31..317G }}</ref> and any subsequent mass changes being relative to the IPK.  A technique so steam cleaning the prototypes to remove any contaminants was developed in 1946 as part of the second recalibration.<ref>{{cite web

The third periodic recalibration in 1988-9 revealed that the average difference between International Prototype Kilogram and adjusted baseline for the national prototypes was 50&nbsp;<U+03BC>g - in 1889 the baseline of the national prototypes had been adjusted so that the difference was zero. As the IPK is the definitive kilogram, there is no way of telling whether the IPK had been losing mass or the national prototypes had been gaining mass.

===Time===
Until the advent of the atomic clock, the most reliable timekeeper available to mankind was the earth's rotation. It was natural therefore that the astronomers under the auspice of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) took the lead in maintaining the standards relating to time.<ref name=satellite/> During the twentieth century it became apparent that the earth's rotation was slowing down resulting in days becoming 1.4 milliseconds longer each century<ref name=LeapSeconds>{{cite web

In 1956 the 10th CGPM instructed the CIPM to prepare a definition of the second; in 1958 the definition was published stating that the second would be calculated by extrapolation using earth's rotational speed in 1900. <ref name=LeapSeconds/>  Astronomers from the [[US Naval Observatory]] (USNO) and the [[National Physical Laboratory]] determined a relationship between the frequency of radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom and the estimated rate of rotation of the earth in 1900.  Their value was adopted in 1968 by the 13th CGPM.

===Electrical units===
[[Image:FourMetricInstruments.JPG|thumb|200px| Four domestic quality contemporary measuring devices that have metric calibrations - a [[tape measure]] calibrated in [[centimetres]], a [[thermometer]] calibrated in [[degrees Celsius]], a [[kilogram]] weight (mass) and an electrical [[multimeter]] which measures [[volts]], [[ampere|amps]] and [[ohms]].]]
In 1921 the Treaty of the Metre was extended to cover electrical units with the CGPM merging its work with that of the IEC.  At the 8th CGPM in 1933 the need to replace the "International" electrical units with "absolute" units was raised. The IEC proposal that Giorgi's proposal be adopted was accepted, but no decision was made as to which electrical unit should be the fourth base unit. In 1935 Sears proposed that this should be the ampere, but [[World War II]] prevented this being formalised until 1946.  The definitions for absolute electrical system became effective from 1 January 1948.<ref name=satellite/>

===Temperature===
At the start of the twentieth century, the fundamental macroscopic laws of thermodynamics had been formulated and although techniques existed to measure temperature using empirical techniques, the scientific understanding of the nature of temperature was minimal.  Maxwell and Boltzmann had produced theories describing the inter-relational of temperature, pressure and volume of a gas on a microscopic scale but otherwise, in 1900, there was no understanding of the microscopic or quantum nature of temperature.<ref name=Pledge>{{cite book

A series of lookup tables defined temperature in terms of inter-related empirical measurements made using various devices.

When, in 1948 the CGPM was charged with producing a coherent system of units of measure, definitions relating to temperature had to be clarified.  At the 9th CGPM, the centigrade temperature scale was renamed the celsius temperature scale and the scale itself was fixed by defining the triple point of water as 0.01&nbsp;<U+00B0>C,<ref name=CGPM_9_3>{{cite conference

===Luminosity===
Prior to 1937,  the [[International Commission on Illumination]] (CIE from its French title, the Commission Internationale de l<U+00B4>Eclairage) in conjunction with the CIPM produced a standard for luminous intensity to replace the various national standards.

In 2007 the CIPM and the CIE agreed a program of cooperation with the CIPM taking the lead in defining the use of units of measure and the CIE taking the lead in defining the behaviour of the human eye.<ref>{{cite web

=== Mole ===
The mole was originally known as a gram-atom or a gram-molecule - the amount of a substance measured in grams divided by its [[atomic weight]].   Originally chemists and physicists had differing views regarding the definition of the atomic weight - both assigned a value of 16&nbsp;[[atomic mass units]] (amu) to oxygen, but physicists defined oxygen in terms of the <sup>16</sup>O isotope whereas chemists assigned 16&nbsp;amu to <sup>16</sup>O, <sup>17</sup>O and <sup>18</sup>O isotopes mixed in the proportion that they occur in nature.  Finally an agreement between the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]]<ref>{{cite web

This agreement was confirmed by ISO and in 1969 the CIPM recommended its inclusion in SI as a base unit.  This was done in 1971 at the 14th CGPM.<ref>{{SIBrochure8th|pp 114 - 115}}</ref>

The 9th CGPM met in 1948, fifteen years after the 8th CGPM. In response to formal requests made by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics and by the French Government to establish a practical system of units of measure, the CGPM requested the CIPM to prepare  recommendations for a single practical system of units of measurement, suitable for adoption by all countries adhering to the Metre Convention. <ref>{{cite conference

The CIPM's draft proposal, which was an extensive revision and simplification of the metric unit definitions, symbols and terminology based on the MKS system of units, was put to the 10th CGPM in 1954. In accordance with Giorgi's proposals of 1901, the CIPM also recommended that the ampere be the base unit from which electromechanical would be derived. The definitions for the ohm and volt that had previously been in use were discarded and these units became derived units based on the metre, ampere, second and kilogram. After negotiations with the CIS and IUPAP, two further base units, the degree kelvin and the candela were also proposed as base units.<ref>{{cite conference

When the metre was redefined in 1960, the kilogram was the only SI base unit that relied on a specific artifact.  Moreover, after the 1996-1998 recalibration a clear divergence between the various prototype kilograms was observed.

At its 23rd meeting (2007), the CGPM mandated the CIPM to investigate the use of natural constants as the basis for all units of measure rather than the artifacts that were then in use. At a meeting of the CCU held in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading, United Kingdom]] in September 2010, a resolution<ref>{{cite web

:*In addition to the speed of light, four constants of nature  - [[Planck's constant]], an [[elementary charge]], [[Boltzmann constant]] and [[Avogadro's number]] be defined to have exact values.
:*The international prototype kilogram be retired
:*The current definitions of the kilogram, [[ampere]], [[kelvin]] and [[Mole (unit)|mole]] be revised.
:*The wording of the definitions of all the base units be tightened up

The CIPM meeting of October 2010 found that "the conditions set by the General Conference at its 23rd meeting have not yet been fully met. For this reason the CIPM does not propose a revision of the SI at the present time";<ref>{{cite web
