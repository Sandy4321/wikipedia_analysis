'''''Supreme Commander''''' is a [[real-time strategy]] [[video game|computer game]] designed by [[Chris Taylor (game designer)|Chris Taylor]] and developed by his company, [[Gas Powered Games]]. The game is considered to be the [[spiritual successor]] to Taylor's 1997 game, ''[[Total Annihilation]]''.<ref name="Gamespot Q&A">{{cite web

}}</ref> the game was released on February 16, 2007 in [[Europe]] and February 20, 2007 in [[North America]]. A [[Expansion pack#Stand-alone expansion packs|standalone]] expansion, ''[[Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance]]'', was released on November 6 of the same year.

''Supreme Commander'' is focused on using a giant bipedal [[mech]] called an Armoured Command Unit (or ACU) to build a base, then upgrading units to reach higher technology tiers, and conquering opponents. The player can command one of three nations: the Aeon Illuminate, the Cybran Nation, or the United Earth Federation. ''Supreme Commander'' was highly anticipated in pre-release previews, and was received well by critics, with a [[Metacritic]] average of 86 out of 100.<ref name="supcompcrev-Metacritic"/>

== Gameplay ==
A game of ''Supreme Commander'' normally begins with the player solely possessing a single irreplaceable 'Armoured Command Unit', or ACU, the titular 'Supreme Commander'.  Normally the loss of this unit results in the loss of the game.  These [[mech]] suits are designed to be transported through [[Quantum mechanics|quantum gateways]] across the galaxy and contain all the materials and [[blueprint]]s necessary to create a 37th century army from a planet's native resources in hours. All standard units except Commanders and later-summoned Support Commanders are entirely [[robot]]ic in nature, and do not require a local pilot.

All units and structures belong to one of four technology tiers or 'Tech' levels. Upgrading structures and producing advanced engineers allows the player to produce higher quality units. The first tier is available at the start of the game and consists of small, relatively weak units and structures. The second tier expands a player's abilities greatly, especially in terms of stationary weapons and [[energy shield|shielding]], and introduces upgraded versions of tier one (t1) units. The third tier level has very powerful assault units designed to overcome the fortifications of the most [[Trench warfare|entrenched]] player. The fourth, "experimental" technology tier includes massive constructions that take many resources and a lot of time to construct.

''Supreme Commander'' features a varied skirmish AI. The typical ''Easy'' and ''Normal'' modes are present, but the ''Hard'' difficulty level has four possible variants. ''Horde AI'' will swarm the player with hordes of lower level units, ''Tech AI'' will upgrade its units as fast as possible and assault the player with advanced units, the ''Balanced AI'' attempts to find a balance between the two and the "Supreme AI" which decides which of the three hard strategies is best for the map. The single player campaign consists of eighteen missions, six for each faction. The player is an inexperienced Commander who plays a key role in their faction's campaign to bring the 'Infinite War' to an end. Though there are fewer campaign missions than most games, each mission can last hours. When the player accomplishes objectives, the map is expanded, sometimes doubling or tripling in size, and new challenges are revealed.

=== Resource management ===
Because humans have discovered replication technology, only two types of resources are required to wage war: [[Energy]] and [[Mass]].<ref name="InterviewGameSpy" /> They are primarily obtained by constructing [[Power station|power generators]] anywhere and mass extractors on limited mass deposit spots. Constructor units can gather energy by "reclaiming" it from [[organism|organic]] debris and mass from rocks and wrecked units. It is also possible to generate mass from vast amounts of energy using mass fabricator structures. Each player has a certain amount of resource storage, which can be expanded by the construction of storage structures. This gives the player reserves in times of shortage or allows them to stockpile resources. In addition, if resources are not stored or spent, they are simply wasted.

An adjacency system allows certain structures to benefit from being built directly adjacent to others.<ref name="Roriep5">Rorie (2007). p. 5</ref><ref name="InterviewIGN" /> Energy-consuming structures will use less energy when built adjacent to power generators and power generators will produce more energy when built adjacent to power storage structures. Likewise, factories will consume less energy and mass when built adjacent to power generators and mass fabricators/extractors respectively. The downside to this arrangement is the increased vulnerability of the structures to collateral damage if a power generator or mass fabricator is destroyed.<ref name="Roriep5"/>

=== Warfare ===
[[Image:SupCom ZoomAnimation.gif|right|200px|thumb|''Supreme Commander'' allows the player to zoom out far enough to view the entire map on screen.]]
''Supreme Commander'' uses a "strategic zoom" system that allows the player to zoom out far enough to view the entire map on the screen, at which point it resembles the [[minimap]], denoting individual units with icons.<ref name="InterviewGameSpy" /> Players can also zoom in close enough that the larger units such as battleships fill most of the screen. This system allows ''Supreme Commander'' to have vast units and maps. Scale is important in ''Supreme Commander''. A player can field up to a thousand units at a time, enabling epic battles with thousands of units on the field at once.

A [[battleship]] dwarfs [[submarine]]s,<ref name="InterviewIGN" /> much like a real-world situation would; an [[US Navy|American]] [[Iowa class battleship]] is almost five times as long as a [[German Navy|German]] [[type 212 submarine]].<ref name="IowaFAQ">{{cite web|title=USS Missouri (BB-63) Frequently Asked Questions |work=USS Missouri (BB-63) Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.factplace.com/mightymo.htm#Ship FactPlace.com |last=Schorr|first= Ben M |accessdate=2006-12-16}}</ref><ref name="marine.de">{{Cite web|url=http://www.marine.de/u31 |title=Uboote Klasse 212A |accessdate=2006-10-08 |language=German}}</ref> Both units and maps also use [[normal mapping|normal maps]] in order to allow for a large amount of detail. Late into the game, the larger "experimental" units, such as the Cybran ''Monkeylord'', an enormous spider-shaped assault unit, can actually crush other units.<ref name="InterviewIGN" />

Because of the wide range of planets colonized by humanity in the [[#Setting|setting]], the [[Theater (warfare)|theatres of war]] range from [[desert warfare|desert]] to [[arctic warfare|arctic]], and all [[battlespace]]s are employed.<ref name="GameSpy: Air">{{cite web

|date=2005-07-08}}</ref> Technologies emerging in [[modern warfare]] are frequently employed in ''Supreme Commander''. For example, [[stealth]] technology and both [[Tactical ballistic missile|tactical]] and [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|strategic]] [[missile defense]] systems can be used. An innovative feature is the [[ferry]] system.<ref name="Roriep6">Rorie (2007). p. 6</ref> In ''Supreme Commander'', [[Military Aviation#Military transport aviation and use of airborne troops|air transports]] can be ordered to use ferry routes. Other units can be ordered to move onto the ferry beacons, automatically shuttling them to the other end of the route. Combined with the ability to issue detailed orders from factories, a player can produce units far behind the lines and have them automatically ferried to the front.<ref name="Roriep6"/> By holding the shift key the player can view all orders he has issued, resembling a strategic map. Using this ''shift view'', orders already issued can be moved around easily, which allows for a quick change of plans. Further, when a unit is ordered to attack a target, the player can issue order to perform a ''coordinated attack'' to another unit. This order coordinates the arrival time of the units at the target automatically by adjusting the speed of the units involved.

== Setting ==
The setting of ''Supreme Commander'' is a [[future]] where humanity is able to travel through the galaxy quickly using a [[Quantum tunneling|quantum gateway]], which is a [[Portal (fiction)|portal]] opened from the fabric of space leading to a designated location potentially light-years away.<ref>{{cite web

=== Factions ===
The ''Supreme Commander'' universe features three fictional factions. Each is represented as possessing great zeal and differing ideas on the future of humanity as a whole.

* The '''United Earth Federation''' (or '''UEF''') is the faction representing the interests of a united, Earth-based government. The UEF developed from the ashes of the Earth Empire, and now seeks to reunite humanity and restore Earth's control over the galaxy.<ref>Rorie (2007). p. 2</ref> Their society and military tactics resemble modern society more than the Cybrans or Aeon do.

They fight for the liberation of their fellow [[Cybran]] from the oppressive United Earth Federation.<ref>Rorie (2007). p. 3</ref> The Cybran Nation is led by the brilliant-yet-eccentric Dr. Brackman, patriarch and chief designer of the Cybrans' cybernetic technology.<ref name="Cybran Background">{{cite web

* The '''Aeon Illuminate''' draw their roots from the Golden Age of expansion of the old Earth Empire. The descendants of the first humans to encounter alien intelligent life, a peaceful, yet highly advanced, society known as the Seraphim, who first introduced colonists to their philosophy, known as "The Way". Due to escalating paranoia and [[xenophobia]] among the Old Earth Empire, conflict soon broke out, resulting in the Seraphim's apparent extinction. The colonists of the alien planet, claiming to be "disciples" of the Seraphim, soon founded a civilization supposedly based upon their teachings.<ref>Rorie (2007). p. 4</ref> In a twist of irony, the Aeon Illuminate soon began a zealous assault on the galaxy, intending to "purge" all those who did not share in their beliefs.<ref name="Aeon Background">{{cite web

=== Plot ===
At the start of the single player campaign, the war between the three factions has raged for over a millennium. Every faction has its own problems. For example, the UEF is stretched far too thin, the Cybrans are hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned, and the Aeon [[Commander in Chief]] (namely, the Avatar of War) is stirring unrest amongst the Illuminate. The campaign focuses on a weapon the UEF is building,  a [[planet killer]] named Black Sun. Each side can modify it to their uses. The Cybrans plan to use it to destroy the quantum network, while the Aeon seek to use it to give a message of peace to all people, and as for the UEF, it can mean only one thing: the complete elimination of the other two. The player decides which faction to play as and what course it will take.

Playing through the UEF campaign will cause Black Sun to destroy the critical planets of both the Aeon and the Cybrans, leading the galaxy into a new era of human superiority and ending the thousand-year war.<ref>Rorie (2007). p. 14</ref> 

The Cybran campaign will cause QAI, an enormously intelligent and powerful AI, to spread the quantum virus and free all the symbionts under the control of the UEF. This virus itself disables every quantum gate in the galaxy, stopping [[Faster-than-light|superluminal]] travel for five years, thus allowing the Cybran Nation to flourish without being attacked by the others.<ref>Rorie (2007). p. 23</ref>

Finishing the Aeon campaign causes the [[Princess]] (the leader of the Aeon) to become part of the quantum gate network. This allows the Princess to speak into the mind of every human, and urge all three sides to lay down arms. All three factions make peace with each other after this message.<ref>Rorie (2007). p. 29</ref>

Upon finishing the game, each faction has a different teaser ending, hinting at a new enemy for the next title or [[Expansion pack|expansion]]. The Cybran ending shows QAI calling in unidentified enemies, to Dr. Brackman's horror, and saying "They are coming". The teaser Aeon ending simply depicts princess Rhianne opening her eyes in shock and saying "...no!", while the UEF teaser ending shows many unidentified [[Radar cross section|radar signatures]] appearing near the location of Black Sun on Earth - signs that the Seraphim are coming.

===Post-release===

The first review of ''Supreme Commander'' was written by Dan Stapleton of ''[[PC Gamer]]''. He praised the versatility of the strategic zoom, and expressed his loathing of the next game that wouldn't feature it. The dual-screen mode was highly regarded, the mission design was praised, and the emotional presence of the story was also recognized. However, a few points were docked due to the general lack of diverse unit types, and the game's system requirements. It received a ''PC Gamer'' Editor's Choice Award with a score of 91%.

One of the earliest online reviews after the game's release was written by Alec Meer on [[Eurogamer]].<ref name="supcompcrev-Eurogamer"/> Innovative new features such as the multi monitor support are praised in that review, and the scale element makes a positive impression. Meer remarked though, that ''Supreme Commander'' ''"feels like hard work"'', and that with the emphasis on epic scale, details are overlooked. Still, a rating of 9/10 was awarded.

[[IGN]] rated ''Supreme Commander'' with the rating of 9/10, with reviewer Charles Onyett giving the game the ''Editor's choice award''.<ref name="supcompcrev-IGNUS"/> Particularly the intuitive and helpful strategic zoom and base automation were praised, though the steep hardware requirements and naval pathfinding issues were found less appealing - while they would find their way to their designated target point, their routes were not always the most efficient. IGN [[United Kingdom|UK]], however, was less positive, while still awarding a rating of 8.9/10.<ref name="IGN_UK">{{cite web

}}</ref> The issues addressed by its international counterpart were deemed more severe, and the reviewer was not impressed by the interface, finding the amount of control it gives over the game lacking.

Conversely, the review in the [[Australia]]n version of ''[[GamePro]]'' voiced a negative opinion on the game, giving ''Supreme Commander'' a rating of five out of ten.<ref name="GamePro">{{cite web

}}</ref> ''GamePro'' assessed ''Supreme Commander'' as an over-ambitious game, with performance (measured in [[Frame rate|frames per second]]), even on high end systems, as a major negative point. The reviewers observed that the game gradually slowed down while playing, and that this process accelerated when using the 'shift' key view. This review was subject to controversy, resulting in two rating compiling websites, [[Metacritic]] and [[Game Rankings]], removing it from their websites.<ref>{{cite web

Overall, reviews of ''Supreme Commander'' were positive, with the game having a score of 86/100 on [[Metacritic]].<ref name="supcompcrev-Metacritic"/> In non-English language reviews the game was received positively as well. German reviewer Heiko Klinge gave ''Supreme Commander'' a score of 
82 out of 100. Especially the size and scope of the game were appreciated, while the steep learning curve was a less positive point for the German reviewer.<ref>{{cite web
