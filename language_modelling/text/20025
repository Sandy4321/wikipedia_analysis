Retrieved May 21, 2010.</ref> Initially the group was called "Forest Fires", but they determined that the name was "too safe". Nimmo suggested "Oh No" but they soon discovered it was already [[Oh No (musician)|the name of an American rapper]]. They then put the two names together.<ref>Brophy, Adam (March 6, 2008).

== Reception ==
In an album review, ''[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]]'' wrote, "Most of ''The War On Geometry'''s songs are pretty strong and combine a nice melange of influences, but some somewhat miss the mark. Nonetheless, it's a pretty great debut from a bunch of high-energy guys."<ref>Harper, Kate (October 27, 2008).

Retrieved May 27, 2010.</ref> ''[[Exclaim!]]'' wrote in its review, "Canada continues to dish out quality pop rock acts frosted with idiosyncrasies bred in the touch of winter seclusion."<ref>Gray, Scott A.
