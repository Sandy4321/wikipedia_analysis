'''Church architecture in Scotland''' incorporates all church building within the modern borders of Scotland, from the earliest Christian structures in the sixth century until the present day. The early Christian churches for which there is evidence are basic masonry-built constructions on the west coast and islands. As Christianity spread, local churches tended to remain much simpler than their English counterparts. By the eighth century more sophisticated [[ashlar]] block-built buildings began to be constructed. From the eleventh century, there were larger and more ornate [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] buildings, as with [[Dunfermline Abbey]] and [[St Magnus Cathedral]] in Orkney. From the twelfth century the introduction of new monastic orders led to a boom in ecclesiastical building, often using English and Continental forms. From the thirteenth century elements of the European Gothic style began to appear in Scotland, cumulating in buildings such as [[Glasgow Cathedral]] and the rebuilt [[Melrose Abbey]]. Renaissance influences can be seen in a move to a low-massive style that was probably influenced by contacts with Italy and the Netherlands.

From the mid-sixteenth century the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] revolutionised church architecture in Scotland. It resulted in a rejection of the elaborate ornamentation of existing churches. New churches were produced in a plain style, often with a T-plan that emphasised the pulpit and preaching. This style was adopted by both [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] and [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalian]] wings of the Scottish [[Church of Scotland|Kirk]], but there were some attempts to introduce Baroque elements into church building after the [[Restoration (Scotland)|Restoration]]. In the eighteenth century the influence of [[James Gibbs]] led to churches that employed classical elements, with a [[pediment]]ed rectangular plan and often with a steeple. This classicism continued into the early nineteenth century, but became increasingly controversial and began to be rejected for a version of the [[Gothic revival architecture|Gothic revival]], which flourished into the early twentieth century. Between the world wars, a form of [[neo-Romanesque]] became the norm for new churches. In the second half of the twentieth century new churches were highly influenced by [[Modern architecture|modernism]], resulting in rectangular and irregularly shaped buildings, built in new materials, although many of these were later demolished. As the level of new building reduced from the 1970s there was a move to functional and unambitious new churches, but in the 1980s there was a move back to more striking and original designs.

The introduction of Christianity into Scotland from Ireland from the sixth century led to the construction of the first churches. These may originally have been wooden, like that excavated at [[Whithorn]],<ref>J. R. Hume, ''Scotland's Best Churches'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), ISBN 0-7486-2179-2, p. 1.</ref> but most of those for which evidence survives from this era are basic masonry-built churches, beginning on the west coast and islands and spreading south and east.<ref name=Maxwell2005pp22-3>I.

===Romanesque===
{{See also|Romanesque architecture}}
[[File:Dalmeny Kirk.jpg|thumb|[[Dalmeny]] Kirk, one of the finest Romanesque churches in Scotland]]
After the eleventh century, as masonry techniques advanced, ashlar blocks became more rectangular, resulting in more stable walls that could incorporate refined architectural moulding and detailing that can be seen in [[corbel]]ling, [[buttress]]ing, [[lintel]]s and [[arch]]ing. At the same time there was increasing influence from English and continental European designs, known as Romanesque. The Romanesque style had its origins in Roman building techniques and early churches in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Medieval Italy|Italy]]<ref name="West1985p10">T. W. West, ''Discovering Scottish Architecture'' (Botley: Osprey, 1985), ISBN 0-85263-748-9, p. 10.</ref> and was characterised by massive reinforced walls and round arches that could bear the weight of rounded [[barrel vault]] roofs.<ref>M .Perry, M.

The oldest Romanesque church in Scotland is probably the [[St Margaret's Chapel, Edinburgh|small chapel]] built for M<U+00E1>el Coluim's wife [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]] on [[Castle Rock, Edinburgh]], with a vaulted semi-circular [[apse]].<ref name="West1985p10"/> In the twelfth century a number of new parish churches were built by lords on their land. They were often small aisless buildings with two or three connected cells, each of diminishing size, ending in a rounded apse. One of the best preserved is at [[Dalmeny]] in Lothian.<ref name="West1985p11">T. W. West, ''Discovering Scottish Architecture'' (Botley: Osprey, 1985), ISBN 0-85263-748-9, p. 11.</ref> 

[[St Regulus Chapel|St. Regulus Chapel]] at St. Andrews dates from around 1150 and was probably built as a [[reliquary]] church. Only the aisless choir and tall square tower survive. Its detailing derives from work on a church at [[Wharram-le-Street]] in England and it may have been carried out by the same Yorkshire masons.<ref name="West1985p12">T. W.

===Gothic===
{{See also|Gothic architecture}}
[[File:MelroseAbbey01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Melrose Abbey]], one of the most elaborate Gothic buildings in Scotland]]
The style that developed from the Romanesque, originating in twelfth-century France, is now known as Gothic. It was characterised by [[pointed arch]]es, [[ribbed vault]]s and [[flying buttress]]es.<ref name=Maxwell2005pp22-3/> It was brought to Britain by the [[Cistercians]], whose abbeys retained thick walls, but pierced them with [[lancet arch]]es with slender pointed arches. This style became characteristic of the [[Early English Period|early Gothic]] in Britain and can be seen at [[Dundrennan Abbey]], begun around 1142, which resembles religious foundations in northern England.<ref name="West1985pp15-16">T. W. West, ''Discovering Scottish Architecture'' (Botley: Osprey, 1985), ISBN 0-85263-748-9, pp.&nbsp;15<U+2013>16.</ref> The style can also be seen in the East end of [[Elgin Cathedral]], which incorporated typical European Gothic mouldings and tracery.<ref name=Maxwell2005pp22-3/> 

A more elaborate style known as [[decorated Gothic]], applying ornamentation to vaults and pillars, particularly using curved motifs, began to be adopted in the thirteenth century and was characteristic of Scottish church building in the fourteenth century. It was used at [[Dunblane Cathedral]], built in the thirteenth century, particularly to decorate the nave and East end. At [[Fortrose]] in the Highlands the elaborate decoration of this style is still visible in the south aisle. One of the finest examples is [[Sweetheart Abbey]] near [[Dumfries]], a Cistercian monastery, named after the burial of [[John, 5th Baron Balliol|John de Balliol]]'s heart alongside the body of his wife.<ref name="West1985p32&43">T.

[[File:RoslinChapelAppColJM.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Apprentice Pillar in [[Rosslyn Chapel]], one of the most elaborate surviving examples of the late Gothic style]] 
In the fifteenth century continental builders are known to have been working in Scotland. French master-mason John Morrow was employed at the building of [[Glasgow Cathedral]] and the rebuilding of [[Melrose Abbey]], both considered fine examples of Gothic architecture.<ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9">J.

===Renaissance===
{{Main|Renaissance architecture}}
The impact of the [[Renaissance]] on ecclesiastical architecture can be seen in the re-adoption of low-massive church building with round arches and pillars, in contrast to the [[perpendicular Gothic]] style that was particularly [[English Gothic architecture|dominant in England]] in the late Medieval era. The adoption of the low-massive style may have been influenced by close contacts with Rome and the Netherlands, and was perhaps a conscious reaction against English forms in favour of continental ones. It can be seen in the nave of [[Dunkeld Cathedral]], begun in 1406, the facade of [[St Mary's Collegiate Church, Haddington|St Mary's, Haddington]] from the 1460s and in the chapel of Bishop Elphinstone's [[Kings College, Aberdeen]] (1500<U+2013>09).<ref name=Glendinningetal1996pp3-4>M.

===Reformation===
{{See also|Scottish Reformation}}
[[File:Burntisland Parish Kirk.jpg|thumb|left|[[Burntisland]] Parish Kirk, its original wooden steeple now replaced by one of stone]]
From about 1560, the Reformation revolutionised church architecture in Scotland. Calvinists rejected ornamentation in places of worship. With no need for elaborate buildings divided up by ritual there was widespread destruction of Medieval church furnishings, ornaments and decoration.<ref name=BritScot2>{{citation |url=http://www.architecture.com/HowWeBuiltBritain/HistoricalPeriods/Scottish/KirksThroughoutTheAges/Introduction.aspx |publisher=architecture.com |title=Kirks throughout the ages |author=Royal Institute of British Architects |authorlink=Royal Institute of British Architects |accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref> There was a need to adapt old buildings and build new churches suitable for reformed services, particularly by putting the pulpit and preaching at the centre of worship. 

Many of the earliest buildings were simple gabled rectangles, a style that continued to be built into the seventeenth century. Examples include [[Dunnottar Castle]] in the 1580s, [[Greenock]] (1591) and [[Durness]] (1619),<ref name=Spicer2000p517>A. Spicer, "Architecture", in A. Pettegree, ed., ''The Reformation World'' (London: Routledge, 2000), ISBN 0-415-16357-9, p. 517.</ref> These new buildings often had windows on the south wall and none on the north, which became a unique feature of Reformation kirks. There were continuities with pre-Reformation materials, with some churches using rubble, as at [[Kemback]] in Fife (1582). Others employed stone and a few added wooden steeples, as at [[Burntisland]] (1592).<ref>A. Spicer, ''Calvinist Churches in Early Modern Europe'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2007), ISBN 0-7190-5487-7, pp. 53 and 57.</ref> The church of [[Greyfriars Kirk|Greyfriars, Edinburgh]], built between 1602 and 1620, used a rectangular layout with a largely Gothic form, but that at [[Dirleton]] (1612), had a more sophisticated classical style.<ref name=Spicer2000p517/> 

A variation of the rectangular church that developed in post-Reformation Scotland was the "T"-shaped plan, often used when adapting existing churches, which allowed the maximum number of parishioners to be near the pulpit. They can be seen at Kemback and [[Prestonpans]] after 1595. It continued to be used into the seventeenth century as at [[Weem]] (1600), [[Anstruther Easter]], Fife (1634<U+2013>44) and [[New Cumnock]] (1657). In the seventeenth century a [[Greek cross]] plan was used for churches such as [[Cawdor]] (1619) and [[Fenwick, East Ayrshire|Fenwick]] (1643). In most of these cases one arm of the cross would have been closed off as a laird's aisle, meaning that they were in effect "T"-plan churches.<ref name=Spicer2000p517/> Larger churches often had a steeple, as at [[Tron Kirk]], Edinburgh (1636<U+2013>47).<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p141>M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A.

By the later seventeenth century both the Presbyterian and episcopalian wings of the church had adopted the modestly sized and plain form of churches that had emerged after the Reformation.<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p141/> Most had a centralised plan with two or three arms, in a rectangular or T-planned arrangement. Steeples continued to be a major feature, either centrally on the long axis, or on an end gable, in as had been the case in pre-Reformation churches.<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p141/> As a result there was little of the [[baroque]] extravagance in church building seen on the Continent and England.<ref name=Gifford1989pp.62-7>J. Gifford, ''William Adam 1689<U+2013>1748'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream Publishing/RIAS, 1989), ISBN 1-85158-295-9, pp.&nbsp;62<U+2013>7.</ref> Some minor innovations may indicate a move back toward episcopacy in the Restoration era. [[Lauder#church|Lauder Church]] was built by [[Sir William Bruce, 1st Baronet, of Balcaskie|Sir William Bruce]] in 1673 for the [[Sir William Bruce, 1st Baronet, of Balcaskie|Duke of Lauderdale]], who championed the bishops in the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and the Gothic windows of which may have emphasised antiquity, but its basic Greek cross plan remained within the common framework of new churches.<ref name="Glendinningetal1996p141"/> The drive to episcopalian forms of worship may have resulted in more linear patterns, including rectangular plans with the pulpit on the end opposite the entrance. The major exceptions to the standard pattern are in the work of [[James Smith (architect)|James Smith]], who had become a [[Jesuit]] in his youth.<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p143/> These included the rebuilding of [[Holyrood Abbey]] undertaken for [[James II of England|James VII]] in 1687, which was outfitted in an elaborate style. In 1691 Smith designed the mausoleum of Sir [[George Mackenzie (lawyer)|George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh]], in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]], a circular structure modelled on the Tempietto di San Pietro, designed by [[Donato Bramante]] (1444<U+2013>1514).<ref name=Gifford1989pp.62-7/> The [[Latin Cross]] form, increasingly popular in [[Counter Reformation]] Catholicism, was also used, as in Smith's [[Kirk of the Canongate|Canongate Kirk]] (1688<U+2013>90), but here it never saw episcopal service as the Presbyterian revolution of 1689<U+2013>90 occurred before it was completed and the chancel was blocked up, making it, in effect, a T-plan.<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p143>M.

===Eighteenth-century Neo-Classicism===
{{See also|Neo-classical architecture}}
[[File:Saint Andrew's in the Square.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[St Andrew's in the Square]], Glasgow, one of the first Scottish churches influenced by [[James Gibbs]]]]
In the eighteenth century established patterns continued, with T-shaped churches with steeples on the long side, as at New Church, [[Dumfries]] (1724<U+2013>27), and [[Newbattle]] Parish Church (1727<U+2013>29). [[William Adam (architect)|William Adam]]'s [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]] Parish Church (1729<U+2013>32), was a Greek cross plan inscribed in a circle, while John Douglas's [[Killin]] Church (1744) was octagonal. Scots-born architect [[James Gibbs]] was highly influential on British ecclesiastical architecture. He introduced a consciously antique style in his rebuilding of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], London, with a massive, steepled [[portico]] and rectangular, side-aisled plan. Similar patterns in Scotland can be seen at [[St Andrew's in the Square]] (1737<U+2013>59), designed by Allan Dreghorn and built by the master mason Mungo Nasmyth, and at the smaller [[Donibristle]] Chapel (completed 1731), designed by [[Alexander McGill (architect)|Alexander McGill]]. Gibbs' own design for St. Nicholas West, Aberdeen (1752<U+2013>55), had the same rectangular plan, with a nave-and-aisles, barrel-vaulted layout with superimposed pedimented front.<ref name="Glendinningetal1996p143"/> After the Toleration Act of 1712, episcopalians began building a limited number of new chapels including Alexander Jaffray's St Paul's chapel in Aberdeen (1721), the meeting house designed by McGill in Montrose, an Edinburgh chapel opened in 1722 and [[St Andrew's-by-the-Green]] in Glasgow (1750<U+2013>52), which adopted a simpler version of Gibbs' pedimented rectangular plan.<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p143-4>M.

In the second half of the eighteenth century, Scotland's rapidly expanding economy and population resulted in the laying out of numerous [[new towns]] and remodelled settlements, resulting in a need for new churches to support the local residents. These included [[St Andrew's and St George's West Church]], George Street, in the [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town of Edinburgh]], designed by Andrew Frazer (1782<U+2013>87), followed in the tradition of Gibbs, with an oval plan, tetrastyle [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] portico and a tall steeple. The builder, [[Alexander Stevens]], probably also designed the steeple of [[The Parish Church of St Cuthbert|St Cuthbert's Church]] (1789<U+2013>90).<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p176>M.

{{See also|Neo-classical architecture}}
[[Image:St-Stephens-Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Gracco-Baroque St Stephen's, Edinburgh]]
In the early nineteenth century the Gibbs-influenced steepled tradition continued, as can be seen in [[Robert Nisbet]]'s [[Inveresk]] Church (1803<U+2013>10). A Grecian form was developed at [[William Burn]]'s [[North Leith]] Church (1813) and St John's Episcopal Church, Edinburgh (1816). The controversy over the style of the [[Scottish National Monument]] in 1816 led to the labelling of Greek temple motifs as "pagan" and relatively few columnar Greek churches were built after that in the capital. An exception was [[Archibald Elliot]]'s [[Broughton, Edinburgh|Broughton]] Church (1820<U+2013>21), which had a Doric temple front. More common in Edinburgh were churches that combined classical elements with other features, like the domed St George's, [[Charlotte Square]] (1811<U+2013>14), executed by [[Robert Reid (architect)|Robert Reid]], or the Gracco-Baroque of [[William Henry Playfair|William Playfair]]'s [[St Stephen's Church, Edinburgh|St Stephen's]] (1827<U+2013>28).<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p234>M.

MacKechnie, ''A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), ISBN 0-7486-0849-4, p.&nbsp;234.</ref> In Glasgow there was a tradition of grafting porticoes on to existing meeting-houses, which continued in [[James Gillespie Graham|Gillespie Graham]]'s West George Street Independent Church (1818), which was criticised as "[[anti-popery|popish]]", and John Baird I's Greyfriars United Secession Church (1821), which was fronted by a Roman Doric portico. Classical designs for the established Church included the redevelopment by William Stark of [[St George's-Tron Church]] (1807<U+2013>08), [[David Hamilton (architect)|David Hamilton]]'s St Enoch's Parish Church (1827) and St Paul's Parish Church (1835).<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p234/>

===Gothic revival===
{{See also|Gothic revival architecture}}
As elsewhere in Western Europe, in the nineteenth century there was a return to Medieval styles, grouped together into a Gothic revival. Early examples included Adams' St George's Episcopal Chapel in Edinburgh (1792), which included octagonal lantern on [[ogival arch]]es. Other examples included [[James Playfair]]'s chapel-like [[Farnell]] Church (c. 1789) and Richard Crichton's towered [[Craig, Angus|Craig]] Parish Church (1799). In the early nineteenth century examples influenced by the [[English Gothic architecture|English Perpendicular]] included [[Glen Orchy|Glenorchy]] Church (1810<U+2013>11), built by the [[Earl of Breadalbane]], John Paterson's octagonal reconstruction of St Paul's Church, [[Perth]] (c. 1800<U+2013>07) and Fetteresso Church, [[Stonehaven]] (1810<U+2013>12). Examples of a more explicitly perpendicular form can be seen in Gillespie Graham's [[Collace]] (1813), or David Hamilton's Old [[Erskine]] (1813<U+2013>14).<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p234/>

As urban populations grew, major neo-Gothic churches were built to accommodate them. After the passing of the [[Catholic Relief Act]], James Gillespie Graham designed St Andrew's Roman Catholic Chapel in Glasgow (1814<U+2013>17). There was also growth in the Episcopal Church, which benefited from the mainly Anglican migrant English workers. In Edinburgh these were modelled on the English Perpendicular, as at St Paul's York Place (1816<U+2013>18), the towered St John's Chapel (1816<U+2013>18) and St David's (Ramshorn) (1824<U+2013>26). In Glasgow, the Ramshorn Kirk's has a T-plan and symmetrical front with tall tower.<ref name="Glendinningetal1996p234"/>

The Kirk began to concern itself with providing churches in the new towns and relatively thinly supplied Highlands, establishing a church extension committee in 1828. Led by [[Thomas Chalmers]], by the early 1840s it had added 222 churches, largely through public subscription. When the [[Great Disruption]] occurred in 1843, and roughly a third of ministers and their congregations left the established church and its buildings to form the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]], Chalmers' organisational skills helped the Free Church build over 700 new places of worship by 1847. The established church took time to recover, but embarked on a rival programme of church building, increasing its number of parishes from 924 in 1843 to 1,437 by 1909.<ref name=Brooks1995pp17-18>C.

The intense competition for congregations also led to changes to make worship more attractive that were reflected in architecture.<ref name=Brown2012p95/> The Church of Scotland was among the first European Protestant churches to engage in liturgical innovation reflected in seating arrangements, abandoning [[box pew]]s for open benches. From the middle of the nineteenth century some of its churches, like Greyfairs in Edinburgh, began installing organs and stained glass windows, reflecting an attempt to return to forms of worship largely excluded since the late seventeenth century. At [[Duns]] the church was rebuilt (opened 1888) in a plan used in the Middle Ages, with a separate chancel, communion table at the far end, and the pulpit under the chancel arch. The influence of the [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiological movement]] can be seen in churches built at [[Crathie]] (opened 1893), which had an [[apse|apsidal]] chancel raised above the level of the nave, a stone pulpit and a brass lectern, and [[The Parish Church of St Cuthbert|St. Cuthbert's, Edinburgh]] (rebuilt 1894), with a marble communion table in a chancel decorated with marble and mosaic.<ref>N.

A sub-set of the Medieval revival were [[Neo-romanesque]] churches, often called "Norman" at the time, built in a style that incorporated Romanesque, [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Anglo-Saxon]] features within a low-massive framework. These were utilised by all the major denominations. Examples include the Church of Scotland buildings at [[Errol, Perth and Kinross|Errol]] (1831<U+2013>33); the Catholic St. Anthony's Chapel, [[Murthly]] (1845); McBridge Free Church, [[Rothesay, Bute|Rothsay]] (1845); and the Episcopalian St. Thomas, Rutland Place, Edinburgh (1842<U+2013>43).<ref name=Glendinningetal1996pp234&304>M.

The Gothic style developed fully in the later nineteenth century.<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p234/> Important figures included [[Frederick Thomas Pilkington]] (1832<U+2013>98), who adapted the Gothic style for the needs of the Free Church of Scotland, as at [[Barclay Viewforth Church]], Edinburgh (1862<U+2013>64).<ref name=Stamp1995pp108-10>G.

In the first half of the twentieth century, there continued to be isolated examples of Gothic church building, including L. G. Thomson's Reid Memorial Church, Edinburgh (1929<U+2013>33) and J. Taylor Thomson's [[St John's Renfield Church|St John Renfield Church, Glasgow]] (1927<U+2013>31). The most common forms in this period were plain and massive Neo-Romanesque buildings. Protestant examples included H. O. Tarbolton's [[Bangour]] Village Church (1924<U+2013>30) and L. G. Thomson's [[Fairmilehead]] Church (1937). Roman Catholic examples included [[Reginald Fairlie]]'s Immaculate Conception Church, [[Fort William, Scotland|Fort William]] (1933<U+2013>34), and Archibald Macpherson's St Matthew, [[Rosewell, Midlothian|Rosewell]] (completed 1926).<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p418>M.

[[File:St. Patrick's, Orangefield from west.jpg|thumb|left|St. Patrick's Church, Orangefield in (1934<U+2013>35) [[Greenock]], one of [[Gillespie, Kidd & Coia]] pre-war brick-style architecture]]
The reunification of the Church of Scotland in 1929 removed much of the need for new Presbyterian church-building, which was replaced by a tendency towards renovating nineteenth-century churches, toning-down ritualistic furnishings; replacing dark varnish by white or neutral colour schemes. The main tendency in church design in the 1930s was a move towards classicism. There were isolated large classical Protestant commissions, such as Bristo Baptist Church, Edinburgh (1933<U+2013>35), but the major buildings in this form were in the Catholic Church where there was a movement towards worshipper-centred basilican plans, after the pontificate of [[Pius X]] (1903<U+2013>14). This movement reached its peak in the 1960s after the [[Second Vatican Council]].<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p418/> The leading figure in pursing this style was Giacomo Antonio (Jack) Coia, who after the deaths of his partners, was the sole heir to the Glasgow-based practice of [[Gillespie, Kidd & Coia]]. From the later 1920s he pursued a brick style of Catholic architecture, pioneered by Macpherson in Edinburgh and combined with the classical tendencies of Fairlie's refacing of St Patrick's, [[Cowgate]] (1928<U+2013>29). Coia's first church, St Anne's, [[Dennistoun]] (1931), utilised the engineering techniques of [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], resulting in a broad, centralised space, with narrow arcades rather than aisles, with a monumental facade of red-brick. He used a more linear plan in subsequent designs, including St Patrick, [[Greenock]] (1934<U+2013>35), St Columba, [[Maryhill]] (1937), and St Columbkille, [[Rutherglen]] (1934<U+2013>40). The early Christian and Byzantine character of the most striking of these, St Patrick's, was enhanced by carvings by [[Archibald Dawson]]. Coia's use of selective details was probably indebted to Mackintosh. Later in the decade Coia took into partnership T. Warnett Kennedy. Kennedy's temporary, open-roofed Catholic chapel at the [[Empire Exhibition, Scotland 1938|Empire Exhibition]] (1938) was fronted by a Mackintosh-like grid of metalwork, and with his St Peter in Chains Church, [[Ardrossan]] (1938), with austere walls and towers, showed the influence of the "abstract compositions" of contemporary Swedish architecture and pointed to the future influence of modernism.<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p419>M.

===Modernism and Post-Modernism===

[[File:Mortonhall Crematorium - geograph.org.uk - 362793.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mortonhall]], Edinburgh, designed by [[Basil Spence]]]]
After the Second World War, there was another period of rapid church building, as the creation of new towns and [[council house]] estates necessitated the rapid supply of new churches.<ref name=Brown1997p164>C. G. Brown, ''Religion and Society in Scotland Since 1707'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 1997), ISBN 0-7486-0886-9, p. 164.</ref> The austerity, shortage of materials and need for rapid building, discouraged the development of innovative design. This was accompanied by the rejection by most architects of traditional forms in favour of  "[[International style (architecture)|international modernism]]", characterised by simple outlines, uncluttered internal spaces, absence of colour, and flat roofs.<ref name=Hume2012>J. R. Hume, [http://www.scotlandschurchestrust.org.uk/explore-our-churches/exploring-with-essays/post-war-churches-in-scotland/ "Post-War Churches In Scotland: Breaking The Mould"], ''Scotland's Churches Trust'', retrieved 29 December 2012.</ref>

The Catholic Church, whose traditional membership was most affected by the changes in housing, was the first to react to this situation, creating 76 new parishes between 1845 and 1960 in the west of the country alone. The Baptist and Episcopalian churches followed close behind, particularly in the new towns.<ref name=Brown1997p164/> Within the Church of Scotland, the closeness of congregation and clergy was expressed in the domestic plainness of 1950s duel-use [[hall church]]es, as at Reiach's [[Kildrum]] Parish Church, [[Cumbernauld]] (completed 1962), a steel framed building, clad in timber and brick with a flat roof.<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p471-2>M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, ''A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), ISBN 0-7486-0849-4, pp.&nbsp;471<U+2013>2.</ref> Of 129 buildings erected by the Church of Scotland between 1948 and 1959, 108 were on this basic pattern.<ref name=Brown1997p164/>

The influence of more radical [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionism]] and [[Modern architecture|Modernism]] can be seen in buildings such as [[Basil Spence]]'s [[Mortonhall]] Crematorium, Edinburgh (1964<U+2013>67), with a series of irregular chapels, with smooth-faced blockwork and Wheeler & Sproson's Boghall Church, [[Bathgate]] (1965), influenced by Beaux-Arts architecture.<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p471-2/> The pioneering contribution from the Church of Scotland was St. Columbia's, Glenrothes (1960), which had seating for the congregation on three sides of a central platform, with the choir and elders on the fourth side behind the pulpit.<ref>N. Yates, ''Liturgical Space: Christian Worship and Church Buildings in Western Europe 1500<U+2013>2000 Liturgy, Worship & Society'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008), ISBN 0-7546-5797-3, p. 156.</ref> 

[[File:St Pauls RC Church Glenrothes.jpg|thumb|left||alt=Modernist Church coated with white render with large modern stained glass window and a wooden cross protruding from the roof of the two storey tower element of the building |St. Paul's R.C. Church, Glenrothes, one of the first modernist churches produced by [[Gillespie, Kidd & Coia]]]]
In the Roman Catholic Church, the most important steps towards an [[expressionism|expressionist]] design were under taken by Gillespie, Kidd & Coia. This began with St Paul's Church in the new town of [[Glenrothes]] (1956<U+2013>57). This was a wedge-shaped construction of white-painted common brick focused on a dramatic, jagged metal cross by the sculptor [[Benno Schotz]]. From about 1960, all Gillespie, Kidd & Coia's churches were designed in this [[Late Modernism|Late Modernist]] style, as at St Bride's, [[East Kilbride]] (1963<U+2013>64), which had a rectangular plan. From the mid-1960s, they adopted a centralised, non-rectangular plan, with seating ranged round the altar, reflecting liturgical change. Sacred Heart Church, [[Cumbernauld]] (1964), was rectangular, of load-bearing brick, dramatically lit through dark coloured windows. Our Lady of Good Counsel, [[Dennistoun]] (1965) had a splayed plan and slanted ceiling. St Benedict Drumchapel (1965<U+2013>67) had a prow-like roof on curved, laminated timbers. These innovative designs inspired others to experiment, including J. McCarron's Our Lady of Sorrows, [[South Uist]] (1964<U+2013>65). However, many of these designs proved too radical and were later demolished by the Catholic Church, citing structural or maintenance problems.<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p475>M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, ''A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), ISBN 0-7486-0849-4, p.&nbsp;475.</ref> 

The end of this phase of church-building, as the production of new housing subsided in the 1970s, saw a return to conservatism in church design, which may have reflected a loss of confidence in the churches as attendances rapidly declined.<ref name=Hume2012/> M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie have identified a "post-Coia" style emerging in this period.<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p487>M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, ''A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), ISBN 0-7486-0849-4, p.&nbsp;487.</ref> The limited building, some replacing existing churches, tended to be by building companies using laminated timber beams, exposed brickwork and pyramidal roofs to produce utilitarian, if aesthetically unadventurous, constructions.<ref name=Hume2012/> From the late 1980s there were some original designs, including St Mary the Virgin, in [[Port Glasgow]] (1984) by Frank Burnet, Bell and Partners; St Anthony's Catholic church in [[Kirriemuir]] (1987), by James F. Stephen Architects; and the replacement church at St Joseph's Catholic Church, [[Faifley]] (1997) by Jacobsen and French.<ref name=Hume2012/> There was also the [[postmodern architecture|postmodern]] design of St John Ogalvy Catholic Church, [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]] (1982),<ref name="Glendinningetal1996p487"/> and the nearby [[Girdle Toll]] parish church, converted from a farmhouse (1992).<ref name=Hume2012/>
