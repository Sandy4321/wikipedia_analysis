The '''SR Merchant Navy Class,''' given the nickname "Spam Cans" or "Packets" by locomotive drivers after the doyen of the class, was originally a class of [[streamlined]] [[4-6-2]] steam locomotive designed for the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] by [[Oliver Bulleid]]. The first members of the class were constructed during the Second World War, with the final total eventually amounting to 30 locomotives. 

The 'Merchants' incorporated many innovations that revolutionised British steam locomotive design, such as thermic syphons.  The class was named after Merchant Navy shipping lines involved in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], and latterly those which used [[Southampton]] docks.  This was an astute publicity masterstroke for the Southern Railway.

Due to problems with some of the more novel features of Bulleid's design, all members of the class were subsequently rebuilt by [[British Railways]] during the late 1950s. The 'Merchants' operated until the end of Southern steam in July 1967, and a third of the class have happily been saved from the cutter's torch, and can be seen on heritage railways and the mainline throughout Britain.

==Background==

The gestation of the Merchant Navy Class Pacifics went as far back as 1938, when Sir Eustace Missenden, the Director of the Southern Railway, realised that the company lagged behind in terms of pioneering locomotive design.<ref name=Harvey />
Bulleid, who had been brought in from the [[LNER]] to replace Richard Maunsell as Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) believed that it was time for the Southern to lead the field with a new Pacific design.<ref name=Harvey />

This was due to the fact that the newest locomotive class on the railway was an 0-6-0 Q Class that was built to Victorian principles.<ref name=Morgan> Morgan, John Scott: ''The Story of the Q1s'' (KRB Publications: Bishop's Waltham, 2003) ISBN 0954485912</ref>
Intended primarily for express passenger and semi-fast work in South-East and South-West England, the new class was also designed to be equally adept at both freight workings due to the nominal 'mixed traffic' classification Bulleid applied to the class for them to be built in wartime.<ref name=Harvey />

== Construction history ==

Initially, ten were built as [[mixed-traffic locomotive]]s from 1941, the first being 21C1 ''Channel Packet''. <ref> Southern E-Group (2004)[http://www.semg.org.uk/steam/mn_01.html], Retrieved April. 16, 2007. For a picture of ''Channel Packet'' as built.</ref>They were classed as such for Bulleid to traverse the ban on the construction of express passenger locomotives imposed by the government during the war.<ref name=Creer>Creer,S & Morrison,B: '' The Power of the Bulleid Pacifics'' (Oxford Publishing Company: Oxford, 2001) ISBN 0860930823 A-D Pages: 7; 21; 40-41; 74-75.</ref>  

All locomotives were constructed at the former [[London and South Western Railway]] works at Eastleigh, with two batches being constructed under the auspices of the Southern Railway.  The locomotives were constructed with Bulleid's revolutionary use of welding in boiler construction as opposed to rivets.  This resulted in a higher boiler pressure than any other regular service locomotive, at 280psi.  They also sported Bulleid's novel, if highly troublesome, chain-driven valve gear, and were provided with 'air-smoothed' casings and [[Boxpok|Bulleid-Firth-Brown]] wheels.[http://www.hurstmereclose.freeserve.co.uk/assets/images/chains.jpg][http://www.watercressline.co.uk/tw/pics/wc-valve.jpg]  Electric lighting was also provided, powered by a steam generator below the footplate (cab), as well as a steam operated treadle that used steam pressure to open the firehole doors as an aid to the fireman.<ref name=BiR>''Bulleids in Retrospect,'' Transport Video Publishing, Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire </ref>

The Southern-built batch years were as follows:

* 21C1-21C10:  Completed 1941-1942

* 21C11-21C20: Completed 1944-1945

Both Southern-built batches had detail differences, the latter having a horizontal ridge in the air-smoothed casing, and certain design features were removed, such as the steam operated firehole door treadle.  The entire class was also subjected to modifications during the time they operated under the Southern Railway, the chief of which was the redesign of the footplate spectacle plates to the V-profile that all Bulleids depict post-Nationalisation.  Originally, the spectacle plates were 90 degrees to the air-smoothed casing, offering limited vision ahead for the driver.<ref name=Creer />

The Merchant Navy design spawned the construction from 1945 of the [[SR West Country Class|West Country]]/[[SR Battle of Britain Class|Battle of Britain]] classes, resulting in lighter locomotives with increased route availability.  This was necessary on the Southern's 'Withered Arm' West of Exeter, as Merchant Navy Class locomotives were banned from this section due to weight restrictions.<ref name=BiR />

== Naming the locomotives ==

The Southern Railway considered naming them after victories of World War II (a mocked-up nameplate "[[River Plate]]" was produced).<ref name=Burridge>Burridge, Frank: ''Nameplates of the Big Four'' (Oxford Publishing Company: Oxford, 1975) ISBN 0902888439</ref>  In the event, the chairman of the [[Union Castle Line]] suggested naming them after shipping companies which had called at [[Southampton]] Docks in peacetime. <ref> Southern E-Group (2004)[http://www.semg.org.uk/steam/mn_02.html], Retrieved April. 16, 2007. For details of the naming process.</ref> This idea had more suitability in 1941 due to the fact that the shipping lines were heavily involved in the Atlantic convoys to and from Britain during the [[Second World war]].<ref name=Burridge>Burridge, Frank: ''Nameplates of the Big Four'' (Oxford Publishing Company: Oxford, 1975) ISBN 0902888439</ref> 

==Livery and numbering== 
=== Southern ===

Livery was SR Malachite Green with "Sunshine Yellow" horizontal lining and lettering.  All class members that operated during the [[Second World War]] were eventually outshopped in  Southern Wartime Black livery, with green shaded 'Sunshine' lettering.  However, this was reverted back to Malachite Green upon the ending of hostilities.  

21C1 ''Channel Packet'' originally had an inverted horseshoe on the smokebox door, indicating its Southern origin, however, locomotive crews believed this to be 'unlucky.'  A resultant re-design meant that this became a roundel, the gap being filled by the date and place of construction, therefore acting as a builder's plate.  The background was painted red.

Early members of the class had cast iron numberplates and gilt 'Southern' plates on the tender, however these were subsequently replaced by transfers.

Bulleid advocated a continental style of locomotive nomenclature, based upon his experiences at the French branch of [[Westinghouse Electric]] before the [[First World War]], and those of his tenure in the rail operating department during that conflict. 
The SR number followed an adaptation of the [[UIC classification]] system where "2" and "1" refer to the number of unpowered leading and trailing axles respectively, and "C" refers to the number of driving axles <U+2013> in this case three. All the locomotives therefore carried the prefix 21C.<ref name=Burridge />

=== Post-1948 (nationalisation) ===

Initial livery after [[nationalisation]] in 1948 was modified Southern malachite green and sunshine yellow with "[[British Railways]]" on the tender, and the Bulleid numbering system was temporarily retained with an "S" prefix such as S21C1.  The second livery carried was the BR Experimental Express Passenger Blue with red or white lining, and was carried until 1952.  From then on, the locomotives carried BR Brunswick Green livery with orange and black lining, and this livery was perpetuated after rebuilding.  The locomotives were renumbered under the BR standard system in the series 35001 to 35030 from 1949.<ref>Ian Allan ABC of British Railways Locomotives, winter 1958/59 edition
</ref>  Rebuilt locomotives were also outshopped in BR Brunswick Green, with the BR crest on the tender sides.

A final batch of ten locomotives was built after [[nationalisation]], never to carry an SR number.<ref name=Herring> Herring, Peter: ''Classic British Steam Locomotives'' (Abbeydale Press: London, 2000) Section "Merchant Navy Class" ISBN 1861470576
</ref>  The [[British Railways|BR]] standard numbering system placed them in the series 35021-35030, and the batch was completed at Eastleigh between 1948-1949.  The BR batch had detail differences to the SR-built versions concerning fuel and water capacity.

== Individual Class members list ==

See [[List of SR Merchant Navy Class locomotives]] for names, numbers and rebuilding dates.

== Rebuilding ==

Between 1956 and 1960, British Railways rebuilt the entire class to a more conventional design by R. G. Jarvis, adopting many features from the BR Standard locomotives that had been introduced since 1950.<ref> Southern E-Group (2004)[http://www.semg.org.uk/steam/mn_51.html], Retrieved [[April 16]], [[2007]]. For more pictures of the rebuilt locomotives.</ref> The 'air-smoothed' streamlined casing was removed and replaced with conventional boiler cladding, and the chain-driven valve gear was replaced with modified [[Walschaerts valve gear]], whilst the boiler pressure was reduced from 280 to 250psi.  The first to be outshopped from Eastleigh was 35018 ''British India Line'' in 1956. The final example, 35028 ''Clan Line'', was completed in 1960. 

The rebuilt Merchant Navy Class was also to influence the design of the future rebuilding of 60 Light Pacifics. As a result of the rebuilding and the implementation of Walschaerts valve gear, the rebuilts were prone to hammerblow on the track, a complaint that was not evident with as-built locomotives due to the balancing required to operate the gear.<ref name=Herring /> 
The rebuilt locomotives were scrapped relatively soon after their rebuilding, an indication of the waste in resources made by BR, as some engines such as 35014 ''Rotterdam Lloyd'' were withdrawn as early as 1964.<ref name=BiR />  The last few engines in traffic survived until the end of steam on the Southern Region in the summer of 1967.

==Operational details==

The locomotives were largely successful, though their heavier axle loading meant that they were banned from certain areas of the Southern, and later, BR(S) network.  The locomotives were often prone to wheelslip, and required very careful driving when starting a heavy train from rest, but once into their stride they were noted for their free running, excellent steam production and being remarkably stable when hauling heavy expresses.<ref name=BiR />

A perennial problem with the unrebuilt Merchant Navy Class locomotives lay with the leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels that in turn splashed oil onto the boiler lagging in service.  Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash which provided a combustible material, and as a result of the heavy braking of the locomotives, sparks would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing.<ref> Southern E-Group (2004)[http://www.semg.org.uk/steam/mn_00.html], Retrieved [[April 16]], [[2007]]. For details on the lagging fires, they were common to both Merchant Navys and Light Pacifics.</ref>  The local fire brigade would invariably be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming into contact with the hot boiler, causing stress to the castings.  Many photographs show an unrebuilt with 'cockled' (warped) casings, a result of a lagging fire.<ref name=Herring />

Another problem was experienced with the exhaust, which beat down onto the air-smoothed casing when the engine was on the move, obscuring the driver's vision from the cab.<ref name=Creer />  The rebuilts were provided with LMS-style smoke deflectors and the lack of air-smoothed casing also helped reduce the problem.<ref name=Creer > Pages 74-75</ref>

==Preservation==
[[Image:35010 Blue Star at Colne Valley Railway.jpg|thumb|left|Number 35010 "Blue Star" on Static display awaiting restoration at the [[Colne Valley Railway]]]]
Many of the class have survived into preservation thanks to the famous [[Woodhams' Scrapyard|Barry Scrapyard]], where steam engines bought from British Railways for scrap were stored rather than cut up. One engine, 35028 ''Clan Line'', was bought by the Merchant Navy Locomotive Preservation Society direct from BR in 1967.<ref name=Herring />  

A third of the Pacifics have survived into the preservation era, although it is very likely that many will never steam again.  Also, no unrebuilt Merchant Navy Class locomotives are in existence.
