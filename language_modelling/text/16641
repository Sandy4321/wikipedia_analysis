'''Stocksbridge Park Steels Football Club''' is a [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Stocksbridge]], [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[England]], playing in the [[Northern Premier League Division One South]].  The club was formed in 1986 after a merger between two other clubs, and initially played in the [[Northern Counties East League]].  In the [[1993-94 in English football|1993&ndash;94]] season the team won the championship of this league but were ineligible to gain [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the [[Northern Premier League]] as their stadium did not meet the required standard.  Two seasons later Stocksbridge finished as Northern Counties East League runners-up and this time gained promotion to the [[Northern Premier League Division One]], where the team remained until the division was regionalised in 2007.  In the [[2005-06 in English football|2005&ndash;06]] season the team reached the play-offs for [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the [[Northern Premier League Premier Division|Premier Division]] but lost to [[Kendal Town F.C.|Kendal Town]] in a [[Penalty shoot-out (football)|penalty shoot-out]].  

The Stocksbridge team wear a yellow and blue kit and play at the Look Local Stadium, which was known as the Bracken Moor Stadium until the club secured a sponsorship deal with a local newspaper in 2006.  The stadium adjoins a cricket pitch and the club was required to erect a dividing fence in order to meet the requirements of the [[Northern Premier League]].  The team have yet to reach the first round of the [[FA Cup]], with their best performance being a run from the preliminary round to the fourth (final) qualifying round in the [[2003-04 in English football|2003&ndash;04]] season.  Their best performance in the [[FA Trophy]], the national competition for higher-level [[Non-league football|non-league]] clubs, was an appearance in the second round proper in the same season.

== History ==
Stocksbridge Park Steels F.C. was formed in 1986 as the result of the merger of [[Stocksbridge Works F.C.]], the works team of the local [[British Steel]] plant, with another local club, Oxley Park Sports F.C.<ref>{{cite book |   last=Bauckham|first=David |   title=Dugouts|   publisher=New Holland |   year=2006|   id=ISBN 1-8453-7478-9|page=p80}}</ref>  The new club was immediately admitted to the [[Northern Counties East League]] Division Two, the works club having previously played in Division Three of the same league,<ref name="FCHD" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fchd.info/STOCKSBW.HTM|title=Stocksbridge Works|publisher=The Football Club History Database|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> which was discontinued in 1986.<ref name="NCEL" />

The Steels spent five seasons in Division Two before being placed in  Division One when the lower division was discontinued upon league re-organisation in 1991.<ref name="NCEL" />  In the same year Mick Horne was appointed as the club's manager,<ref name="Horne" /> and he led the team to the championship of Division One in the [[1991-92 in English football|1991&ndash;92]] season.<ref name="FCHD" />

In Stocksbridge's first season in the Premier Division the team finished near the bottom of the table, but in the [[1993-94 in English football|1993&ndash;94]] season the Steels became Northern Counties East League champions.<ref name="gres" />  The club failed to gain promotion to the [[Northern Premier League]], however, as their stadium did not meet the required standard.<ref name="PP" />  The club finished second in the division two seasons later, losing the championship on [[goal difference]] to [[Hatfield Main F.C.|Hatfield Main]], and on this occasion were admitted to the [[Northern Premier League Division One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engnceleaghist.html|title=England - Northern Counties (East) League|publisher=RSSSF|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref>

Stocksbridge finished in the top half of the table in the club's first five seasons at the higher level, with a best finish of fourth place in the [[2000-01 in English football|2000&ndash;01]] season, but the following season the Steels finished only two places from the bottom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engnorthpremchamp.html|title=England - Northern Premier League|publisher=RSSSF|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref>  Shortly before the end of this season, manager Mick Horne tendered his resignation after 11 years in charge and was replaced by his assistant, former [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] player [[Wayne Biggins]].<ref name="Horne" />

Under Biggins' management, the Steels had their best ever runs in both the [[FA Cup]] and [[FA Trophy]] and set a club record with a 17&ndash;1 defeat of [[Oldham Town F.C.|Oldham Town]] in the [[FA Cup]] preliminary round in August 2002, but remained near the bottom of the league table.<ref name="FCHD" /><ref name="CD" />  After the Steels were defeated 6&ndash;0 by [[Shildon F.C.|Shildon]] in the final qualifying round of the [[2003-04 in English football|2003&ndash;04]] FA Cup, Biggins attempted to resign but the board of directors persuaded him to continue in his job.  However, he left in November 2003, with the club once again fighting a battle against [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]].<ref name="Bigg" />

Former assistant manager of local rivals [[Worksop Town F.C.|Worksop Town]] Peter Rinkcavage was appointed as Stocksbridge's new manager,<ref name="Rink" /> and in the [[2005-06 in English football|2005&ndash;06]] season he led the team to a sixth place finish, sufficient to qualify for the play-offs for promotion to the [[Northern Premier League Premier Division]].  After holding [[Kendal Town F.C.|Kendal Town]] to a 1&ndash;1 draw in the semi-final, the Steels lost a [[Penalty shoot-out (football)|penalty shoot-out]], ending their hopes of promotion.<ref name="FCHD" />

The following season Stocksbridge again finished in sixth place, although with only two teams promoted, it was not high enough to qualify for the play-offs.<ref name="U3">{{cite web|url=http://www.unibondleague.com/tables06_07.php|publisher=The Northern Premier Football League|title=UniBond First Division 2006/2007 |accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref>  Stocksbridge did, however, defeat [[Worksop Town F.C.|Worksop Town]] to win the [[Sheffield and Hallamshire Senior Cup]].<ref name="Star" />  Following this win manager Rinkcavage resigned in order to return to his former club, Worksop, as manager,<ref name="U2">{{cite web|url=http://www.unibondleague.com/news.php?nid=5055|publisher=The Northern Premier Football League|title=Rinkavage Accepts Worksop Manager Position  |accessdate=2007-12-27|date=2007-06-04}}</ref> with Gary Marrow replacing him for the [[2007-08 in English football|2007&ndash;08]] season,<ref name="Marr" /> for which the club was placed in the Southern section of the now-regionalised Division One.<ref name="FCHD" />

==Colours and crest==
[[Image:SteelsOldCrest.png|thumb|right|100px|The club crest prior to 2006]]
The Steels have generally worn a kit of yellow shirts with varying amounts of blue trim, blue shorts, and yellow stockings during their short history.<ref name="Hist2">{{cite web|url=http://www.stocksbridgepsfc.com/abouttheclub.php?page=history|publisher=Stocksbridge Park Steels F.C.|title=Stocksbridge Park Steels - History|accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref>  The club badge is predominantly yellow and blue to reflect this, and features a representation of a clock tower located on Nanny Hill, near the club's stadium, between two footballs displaying the year of the club's formation.  The date was added on the occasion of the club's twentieth anniversary in 2006.  The club is unusual in having an alternate crest for its away shirts with the colours reversed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballcrests.com/clubs/stocksbridge-park-steels-fc|title=Stocksbridge Park Steels F.C.|publisher=FootballCrests.com|accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref>  The team's nickname is "Steels" or "The Steels".<ref name="gres" /><ref name="FA" />

==Stadium==
The Steels have always played their games at what was originally called the Bracken Moor Stadium, the former home of Stocksbridge Works.<ref name="CD" />  In 2006 it was announced that the stadium was to be sponsored by local newspaper ''Look Local'' for a term of five years, resulting in its official name being changed to the Look Local Stadium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northernpremierleague.com/news.php?nid=2877|title=Major Sponsorship Boost for Stocksbridge Park Steels|publisher=The Northern Premier Football League|accessdate=2007-12-18|date=2006-02-17}}</ref>  The stadium has a maximum capacity of 3,500, with 450 seats.<ref name="SC" />

[[Image:BMG small.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Look Local Stadium]]
The ground was a cricket pitch until shortly after the [[Second World War]], when it was purchased by a local steelmaking company and converted into a football stadium. Stone-built changing rooms were erected in the mid 1960s, replacing a small hut, as was a seated stand and terracing.  The main stand has a distinctive angled awning which extends from the fascia and seats which came from [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]'s [[Hillsborough Stadium]].  Floodlights were installed at the stadium in 1990 and the terracing partially covered four years later.<ref name="PP">{{cite web|url=http://www.pyramidpassion.co.uk/html/stocksbridge_park_steels.html|title=Stocksbridge Park Steels FC|publisher=Pyramid Passion|accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref>

As one side of the ground directly adjoins a cricket pitch, the club was required to erect a dividing fence in order to gain entry to the [[Northern Premier League]].  The fence is temporary in nature and is removed during the cricket season.  It was partially funded by money raised from friendlies against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]].<ref name="PP" />

==Supporters==
[[Image:NPLOneGatesGraph.svg|thumb|right|250px|The average attendances by team in the Northern Premier League Division One in the 2006&ndash;07 season, with Stocksbridge highlighted]]
The average attendance at the Look Local Stadium was 176 in the [[2006-07 in English football|2006&ndash;07]] season, the tenth highest of twenty-four teams in the [[Northern Premier League Division One]], with the largest attendance being 332 for the visit of [[Buxton F.C.|Buxton]], the division's best-supported team.  The average figure was the same as in the previous season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tonykempster.co.uk/archive06-07/np1att.htm|title=Attendances - Northern Premier League Division One|publisher=Tony's English Football Site|accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref>  The highest attendance in the club's history was 2,000, for a friendly match against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] to mark the inauguration of the ground's floodlights in October 1991.<ref name="CD" />

The club has an active Supporters' Club which was set up in the mid 1990s.  The Supporters' Club organises events to raise funds for the football club, publishes a fanzine, and operates the club shop at the Look Local Stadium.<ref name="SC">{{cite web|url=http://www.parksteels.co.uk/page_1155146415953.html|publisher=Stocksbridge Park Steels Supporters' Club|title=Supporters Club|accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref>
