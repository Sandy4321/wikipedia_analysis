'''Algebraic statistics''' is the use of [[algebra]] to advance [[statistics]]. Algebra has been useful for [[design of experiments|experimental design]], [[parameter estimation]], and [[hypothesis testing]].

Traditionally, algebraic statistics has been associated with the [[design of experiments]] and [[multivariate analysis]] (especially [[time series]]). In recent years, the term "algebraic statistics" has been sometimes restricted, sometimes being used to label the use of [[algebraic geometry]] and [[commutative algebra]] in statistics.

==The tradition of algebraic statistics==
In the past, statisticians have used algebra to advance research in statistics. Some algebraic statistics led to the development of new topics in algebra and combinatorics, such as [[association scheme]]s.

===Design of experiments===
For example, [[Ronald A. Fisher]], [[Henry Mann|Henry B. Mann]], and [[Rosemary A. Bailey]] applied [[Abelian group]]s to the [[design of experiments]]. Experimental designs were also studied with [[affine geometry]] over [[finite fields]] and then with the introduction of [[association scheme]]s by [[R. C. Bose]]. [[Orthogonal array]]s were introduced by [[C. R. Rao]] also for experimental designs.

===Algebraic analysis and abstract statistical inference===
[[Haar measure|Invariant measures]] on [[locally compact group]]s  have long been used in [[statistical theory]], particularly in [[multivariate analysis]]. [[Arne Beurling|Beurling]]'s [[invariant subspace|factorization theorem]] and much of the work on (abstract) [[harmonic analysis]] sought better understanding of the [[Wold's theorem|Wold]] [[Wold decomposition|decomposition]] of [[stationary stochastic process]]es, which is important in [[time series]] statistics.

Encompassing previous results on probability theory on algebraic structures, [[Ulf Grenander]] developed a theory of "abstract inference".  Grenander's abstract inference and his [[Pattern theory|theory of patterns]] are useful for [[spatial statistics]] and [[image analysis]]; these theories rely on [[lattice theory]].

===Partially ordered sets and lattices===
[[Ordered vector space|Partially ordered vector space]]s and [[Riesz space|vector lattices]] are used throughout statistical theory. [[Garrett Birkhoff]] metrized the positive cone using [[Hilbert metric|Hilbert's projective metric]] and proved [[Perron<U+2013>Frobenius theorem|Jentsch's theorem]] using the [[contraction mapping]] [[contraction mapping theorem|theorem]].<ref>A gap in [[Garrett Birkhoff]]'s original proof was filled by [[Alexander Ostrowski]].

</ref> Birkhoff's results have been used for [[maximum entropy]] [[estimation]] (which can be viewed as [[linear programming]] in [[infinite dimensional optimization|infinite dimensions]]) by [[Jonathan Borwein]] and colleagues. 

[[Riesz space|Vector lattice]]s and [[Riesz space|conical measure]]s were introduced into [[statistical decision theory]] by [[Lucien Le Cam]].

==Recent work using commutative algebra and algebraic geometry==
In recent years, the term "algebraic statistics" has been used more restrictively, to label the use of [[algebraic geometry]] and [[commutative algebra]] to study problems related to [[discrete random variable]]s with finite state spaces. Commutative algebra and algebraic geometry have applications in statistics because many commonly used classes of discrete random variables can be viewed as [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]].

===Introductory example===
Consider a [[random variable]] ''X'' which can take on the values 0, 1, 2. Such a variable is completely characterized by the three probabilities 
:<math>p_i=\mathrm{Pr}(X=i),\quad i=0,1,2</math>
and these numbers clearly satisfy
:<math>\sum_{i=0}^2 p_i = 1 \quad \mbox{and}\quad 0\leq p_i \leq 1.</math>
Conversely, any three such numbers unambiguously specify a random variable, so we can identify the random variable ''X'' with the tuple (''p''<sub>0</sub>,''p''<sub>1</sub>,''p''<sub>2</sub>)<U+2208>'''R'''<sup>3</sup>.

Now suppose ''X'' is a [[Binomial random variable]] with parameter ''p = 1 <U+2212> q'' and ''n = 2'', i.e. ''X'' represents the number of successes when repeating a certain experiment two times, where each experiment has an individual success probability of ''q''. Then 
:<math>p_i=\mathrm{Pr}(X=i)={2 \choose i}q^i (1-q)^{2-i}</math>
and it is not hard to show that the tuples (''p''<sub>0</sub>,''p''<sub>1</sub>,''p''<sub>2</sub>) which arise in this way are precisely the ones satisfying
:<math>4 p_0 p_2-p_1^2=0.\ </math>
The latter is a polynomial equation defining an algebraic variety (or surface) in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, and this variety, when intersected with the [[simplex]] given by
:<math>\sum_{i=0}^2 p_i = 1 \quad \mbox{and}\quad 0\leq p_i \leq 1,</math>
yields a piece of an [[algebraic curve]] which may be identified with the set of all 3-state Bernoulli variables. Determining the parameter ''q'' amounts to locating one point on this curve; testing the hypothesis that a given variable ''X'' is Bernoulli amounts to testing whether a certain point lies on that curve or not.
