'''Italian cuisine''' as a national [[cuisine]] known today has evolved from centuries of social and political change. Its roots can be traced back to [[4th century BCE]] and into the Middle Ages which brought [[Arab]] and [[Normans|Norman]] influence to certain regions along with introduction of notable chefs such as Maestro Martino who cooked an elegant refined Italian cuisine. The cuisine significantly changed with discovery of the [[New World]] helped shape much of what is known as Italian cuisine today with introduction of items as [[potato]]es, [[tomato]]es, [[bell pepper]] and [[maize]], which are all central parts of the cuisine but were not introduced in scale until the [[18th century]].<ref>Del Conte, 11-21.</ref>  

Ingredients and dishes vary by region. There are many significant regional dishes that have become both national and regional. Many dishes that were once regional, however, have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day. Cheese and wine are also a major part of the cuisine, playing different roles both regionally and nationally with their many variations and [[Denominazione di origine controllata]] (DOC) (regulated appellation) laws.  [[Coffee]], and more specifically [[espresso]] has become highly important to the cultural cuisine of Italy.

==History==
Italian cuisine has evolved extensively over the centuries. Although the country known as Italy today had not officially formed until the 19th century, the cuisine can claim roots going back as far as 4th century BC.  Through various influences throughout the centuries, including neighboring regions, conquerors, high-profile chefs, political upheavals as well as the discovery of the New World, a concrete cuisine has formed to what is known today as one of the premiere cuisines in the world.

===Antiquity===
:''See also: [[Roman cuisine]]''
The first known [[food writer]] has been traced back to the [[4th century BCE]].  This writer was a Greek Sicilian named [[Archestratus]], who lived in [[Province of Syracuse|Syracuse]].  His writing was a poem that spoke of using "top quality and seasonal" ingredients of the freshest nature. He also stated that the flavors of the dishes should not be masked by [[spice]]s, [[herb]]s, or other seasonings with an importance put upon this style of preparation for [[fish]].  This style of cuisine seemed to be forgotten during the [[1st century]] AD when ''[[De re coquinaria]]'' was published with 470 recipes included many with heavy usage of spices, herbs which would hide much of the natural flavor of the dish they were used in, much of this would have been considered what would be eaten in the [[patrician]] household.  This does not suggest that the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] of the time did not appreciate high quality ingredients.  The Romans employed the best [[Greek people|Greek]] bakers to produce their [[bread]]s, imported pecorini from [[Sicily]] as the Sicilians were known for producing the best cheese makers.  The Romans were also known as being excellent rearer of pigs for butchering and gardening of [[artichoke]]s and [[leek]]s.<ref>Del Conte, 11.</ref>

===Middle Ages===
:''See also: [[medieval cuisine]]''
[[Muslim]]s invaded Sicily during the [[9th century]] as most of what is known today as Northern Europe was being attacked by [[Viking]] raiders.  As Sicily has already attained much of the culinary traditions from [[Rome]] and [[Athens]], the highly civilized culture combined with the Sicilian to bring what many consider the first real Italian cuisine in Sicily. The [[Arab]]s introduced [[spinach]], [[almond]]s and [[rice]] and some say [[spaghetti]] as it made its possible first appearance during the [[12th century]] AD when the [[Normans|Norman]] king made a survey of Sicily and noted that he saw people making long strings made from flour and water called ''atriya'', which eventually became ''trii'' which is another term used for spaghetti in southern Italy.  Normans also introduced casseroling, [[salt cod]] (baccal<U+00E0>) and [[stockfish]] which remain extremely popular today. <ref>Del Conte, 12.</ref>

[[Food preservation]] techniques were a necessity as refrigeration had not yet been invented.  The two types of preservation were either chemical or physical. Meats and fish would be smoked, dried or kept on ice.  Brine and salt were used to preserve items like pickles, herring and to cure pork meat.  Root vegetables were also preserved in brine after they had been [[parboiled]].  Other items used to preserve foods included [[oil]], [[vinegar]] or immersing animal proteins in their own congealed, rendered fat.  For preserving fruits, liquor, honey and sugar were used.<ref>Capatti, 253-254.</Ref>

The northern regions of future Italy started to show a mix of Germanic and Roman culture while the southern portion continued to reflect the influences of Arab culture as they controlled much of the [[Mediterranean]] trade routes, as such much of the Mediterranean cuisine had been spread by the Arab trade.<ref>Capatti, 2-4.</ref>  The oldest Italian book on cuisine is ''Liber de coquina'' written in [[Naples]] during the [[13th century]].  Dishes included "Roman-style" [[cabbage]] (''ad usum romanorum''), ''ad usum campanie'' which was "small leaves" prepared in the "Campanian manner", a bean dish reflecting the Marca di Trevisio, a ''torta'', ''compositum londardicum'' which are extremely similar to dishes prepared today in Italy. In two other books from the [[14th century]] recipes are found for Roman ''pastello'', Lavagna pie, use of [[salt]] from [[Sardinia]] or [[Chioggia]] again reflecting the importance of the regions of Italy and the foundations of integral dishes.<ref>Capatti, 6.</ref>

During the [[15th century]] Maestro Martino was chef to the [[Patriarch of Aquileia]] at the [[Vatican]]. His manuscript ''Libro de arte coquinaria'' began to illustrate a cuisine with a more refined and elegant design. In his book contains a recipe for ''Maccaroni Siciliani'' which was made by wrapping dough around a thin iron rod and dried in the sun. The macaroni was to be cooked in [[capon]] stock flavored with [[saffron]], illustrating the Arab influence. Of particularly note is Chef Martino's shedding the use of excessive spices in favor of fresh herbs.<ref>Del Conte, 12.</ref>  Martino's cuisine created a methodology that respected proper selection and modes of preparation.  The Roman recipes mentioned in the text includes recipes for ''coppiette'' and cabbage dishes. His [[Florentine]] dishes included eggs with a ''Bolognese torta'', ''Sienese torta'' and for [[Genoa|Genoese]] recipes such as ''piperata'', macaroni, [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[mushroom]]s, and [[spinach]] pie with [[onion]]s.<ref>Capatti, 9-10.</ref>

Martino's manuscript was included in a book printed during [[1475]] in [[Venice]] written by [[Bartolomeo Platina]] entitled ''[[De honesta voluptate et valetudine]]'' ("On Honest Pleasure and Good Health"). Platina puts Martino's "Libro" in cultural context reflexing different regions of Italy including the [[Po Valley]], [[Liguria]], [[Campania]], Piceno, [[Apulia]], and Sicily.  He speaks of ingredients coming from various regions [[perch]] from [[Lake Maggiore]], [[sardine]]s from [[Lake Garda]], [[grayling]] from [[Adda]], hens from [[Padua]], [[olive]]s from [[Bologna]] and Piceno, [[turbot]] from [[Ravenna]], [[rudd]] from [[Lake Trasimeno]], [[carrot]]s from [[Viterbo]], [[bass (fish)|bass]] from [[Tiber]], ''roviglioni'' and [[shad]] from [[Lake Albano]], [[snail]]s from [[Rieti]], [[fig]]s from Tuscolo, [[grape]]s from [[Narni]], [[oil]] from [[Cassino]], [[Orange_(fruit)|orange]]s from [[Naples]] and [[Moray eel|moray]] from [[Campania]]. Grains from [[Lombardy]] and Campania are also mentioned as is [[honey]] from Sicily and Taranto. The [[wine]]s he mentions are from the Ligurian coast, Grecco from Tuscany and San Severino and [[Trebbiano]] from Tuscany and Piceno.<ref>Capatti, 10.</ref>

===Early modern era===
The courts of Florence, Rome, Venice and Ferrara were integral to the creation of the fine cooking in Italy. The court of [[Estes]] in Ferrara was a central figure to the creation of this high-cuisine.  Christoforo Messisbugo steward to [[Ippolito d'Este]] published ''Banchetti Composizioni di Vivande'' in [[1549]]. In this work Messisbugo details banquets in the first-half of the book, in the second-half of the book contains a multitude of recipes for items such as pies and tarts (containing 124 recipes with various fillings). The work does emphasize the use of Eastern spices and sugar which was at this time otherwise beginning to diminish.<ref>Del Conte, 13.</ref>  

[[Image:Scappi.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Bartolomeo Scappi]] personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]]]]
In [[1570]] ''Opera'' was written by [[Bartolomeo Scappi]] personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]].  This was a five-volume work that to that date encompassed the most comprehensive example of Italian cooking. The work contained over 1,000 recipes, with information on banquets including displays and menus as well as illustrations of kitchen and table utensils. The difference between most books written for the royal courts and this volume is its shedding of game and other meats and includes instead domestic animals and courtyard birds which was more inline with the "modest household".  Recipes are also included how to clean and use lesser cuts of meats including tongue, head, and shoulder. The third book contains recipes for fish, or [[Lent]] cookery. Preparations for fish are simple including [[poach]]ing, [[broil]]ing, [[grill]]ed, or fried after being marinated. Particular attention is given to seasons in which fish should be caught and in which location. The final volume includes pies, tarts, fritters and includes a recipe for a Neapolitan pizza. This version of the Neapolitan pizza is not the savory version known today, it was instead a sweet version as tomatoes had not been introduced to Italy as-of-yet. There were recipes for [[corn]] and [[turkey]] however, which were items from the New World.<ref>Del Conte, 14,15.</ref>

[[Image:L'arte.jpg|thumb|left|100px|''L'arte di Ben Cucinare'' published by Bartolomeo Stefani in 1662]]
During the first decade of the 17th century chef Giangiacomo Castelvetro published ''Brieve Racconto di Tutte le Radici di Tutte l'Herbe et di Tutti i Frutti'' (''A Brief Account of all Vegetables, Herbs and Fruit'') which was translated into English by Gillian Riley.  Originally from [[Modena]], Castelvetro moved to [[England]] because of his [[Protestant]] background. The book included an in-depth listing of Italian vegetables and fruits as well as their preparation. The chef's preparation of vegetables featured them at times as a central part of the meal, not just accompaniments. The favored preparation (still popular in Italy today) was to simmer vegetables in salted water and serving them warm or cold with olive oil, salt, fresh ground pepper, lemon juice and [[verjus]] or orange juice. Another preparation includes roasting vegetables wrapped in damp paper over charcoal or embers with a drizzle of olive oil, again a technique still popular today in Italy.  Castelvetro's book is separated into seasons with mentions of hop shoots in the spring and truffles in the winter detailing the truffle scavenge with the use of pigs. New World items were not mentioned in this book as they did not become popular until the [[18th century]].<ref>Del Conte, 14,15.</ref>

In [[1662]] Bartolomeo Stefani chef to Gonzagas published ''L'Arte di Ben Cucinare''.  He was the last chef to publish a book of Italian high-cuisine, but the first to offer a full section on ''vitto ordinario'' ("ordinary food"). The book contained a section on a banquet given by Gonzagas for [[Queen Christina]] of [[Sweden]] with details for preparation prior to the banquet, preparation of the food and table settings including each guest having a setting of a knife, fork, spoon, glass, a plate instead of bowls often used up to this point and a napkin. Other books were published at this time to illustrate how ''scalco'' (server) should manage themselves while serving their guests. An important book to take up this topic was ''Galatheo'' by [[Giovanni della Casa]]. The book instructed waiters to not scratch their heads or other parts of themselves, not to spit, cough or sneeze while serving diners. The book also instructed diners to not use their fingers while eating as well as not wipe their sweat with their napkin.<ref>Del Conte, 15.</ref>

===Modern era===
Much of what is known as Italy today was still governed by [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[Austria]] in the 18th century. In turn it was at the beginning of the 18th century that the culinary books of Italy began to show the regionalism of Italian cuisine in order for Italian chefs to better show the pride of their regions instead of the high cuisine of France. The books written at the time were also no longer addressed to professional chefs but to [[bourgeois]] housewives who could address their home cook.<ref>De Conte, 16</ref>Originating in booklet form, periodicals such as La cuoca cremonese (The cook of Cremona) written in 1794 gives a sequence of ingredients according to season along with chapters on meat, fish and vegetables. As the century progressed these books increased in size, popularity and frequency, while the price to attain them dropped well within the reach of the general populace.<ref>Capatti, 158-159.</ref>

The 18th century peasant diet consisted of heavy foods. Taken more as an animosity toward the high cuisine of the affluent which was more refined and delicate, this diet gave the peasantry their own identity. Even medical texts of the time written by the elite warned peasants from eating refined foods as it was poor for their digestion and their bodies required a more substantial heavy meal to suppress their hunger. It was also thought that peasants had coarse stomachs which were unable to digest refined foods. It was also thought by some that peasants ate poorly because they wanted to eat poorly resulting from the fact that many peasants had to resort to eating rotten foods and moldy breads to survive.<ref>Capatti, 282-284.</ref>

[[Image:081 Vialardi frontes.jpg|thumb|right|100px|''Cucina Borghese'' published by Chef Giovanni Vialardi in 19th century]]
In [[1779]] Antonio Nebbi from [[Marche]] wrote ''Il Cucoco Maceratese''. In this book Nebbi addressed the importance of local vegetables plus [[pasta]] and [[gnocchi]]. Instead of pureed soups in the French style, they included [[Mediterranean]] vegetables along with pasta or rice. For stocks, vegetables and chicken were favored over meat. Similarly Vincenzo Corrado wrote ''Il Cucoco Galante'' in Naples in [[1773]] which featured regional vegetables and ingredients. Particular emphasis was given to ''Vitto Pitagorico'' (vegetarian food) in his words "Pitagoric food consists of fresh herbs, roots, flowers, fruits, seeds and all that is produced in the earth for our nourishment. It is so called because [[Pythagoras]], as is well known, only used such produce. There is no doubt that this kind of food appears to be more natural to man, and the use of meat is noxious." It was also this book that the tomato took its first central role with thirteen recipes. ''Zuppa alli Pomidoro'' first appears in Corrado's book which was the early rendition of [[Tuscan Pappa al Pomodoro]]. In Corrado's 1798 edition he introduced a "Treatise on the Potato" after the approval of France through [[Antoine-Augustin Parmentier]]'s successful promotion.<ref>De Conte, 17</ref>

In the 19th century changes could even be noticed in the writing of chef Giovanni Vialardi, chef to the first king of Italy. In his book ''A Treatise of Modern Cookery and Patisserie'' published in [[Turin]] Vialardi wrote on recipes "suitable for a modest household." Many of his recipes included regional dishes from Turin including twelve recipes for potatoes ''Genoese Cappon Magro'', still an integral regional dish today. Published in 1829, ''Il Nuovo Cuoco Milanese Economico'' written by [[Giovanni Felice Luraschi]] feature dishes regional to [[Milan]] including Kidney with Anchovies and Lemon and Gnocchi alla Romana, also essential to this day. Gian Battista and Giovanni Ratto published ''La Cucina Genovese'' in [[1871]] addressed the regional cuisine of [[Liguria]]. This book contained the first recipe for [[pesto]]. ''La Cucina Teorico-Pratica'' written by Ippolito Cavalcanti mentions the first recipe for pasta with tomatoes in his conversational tone not often seen before this time.<ref>De Conte, 18-19</ref>

==Regional cuisines==
[[Image:Italy Regions 220px (including Pelagie Islands).png|thumb|right|280px|The 20 ''[[Regione|Regioni]]'' of [[Italy]] ]]
Each area has its own proud specialties, primarily at regional level, but also even at provincial level. These regional variances can come from the influence of a bordering country (such as France or Germany), vicinity to the ocean or mountains as well as economic progress. Italian cuisine is not only highly regional, but is also distinguished by being very seasonal with high priority placed on the use of fresh, seasonal produce.

===Friuli-Venezia Giulia===
[[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] shares many traditions with the bordering former [[Yugoslavia]]. The famous [[San Daniele del Friuli]] [[ham]]s come from this region.  Carnia in the northern region is known for its [[bacon]] and Montasio [[cheese]]. Collico, Grave de Friuli, and Colli Orientali are regional [[wine]] favorites. The dishes of the region take on the influence of [[Austrian]], [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]], [[Slovenian]], and [[Croatian]] dishes. [[Beer]] halls of the region feature Viennese sausage, [[goulash]] and [[Bohemian]] [[hare]]. Many of the desserts of the region are [[flour]] based, such as [[strudel]]s. [[Polenta]] is a staple of Venezia Giulia where it finds its way into many variations including stirred dishes, baked dishes and can be seen served with [[sausage]], [[cheese]], [[fish]], or [[meat]]. Dishes made with [[pork]] are often seen in Venezia Giulia and can often be spicy and are often prepared over the open hearth called the ''fogolar''.<ref>Piras, 13.</ref>

===Veneto===
[[Image:Steinpilzrisotto.jpg|left|thumb|125px|A dish of risotto]]
[[Veneto]] is well known for [[risotto]] is a dish where the added ingredients differ by according to location, with [[fish]] and [[seafood]] being added closer to the coast and [[pumpkin]], [[asparagus]], [[radicchio]] and [[frogs' legs]] appearing further away from the [[Adriatic]]. [[Bean]]s and other [[legume]]s are seen in these areas with the dish ''[[pasta e fagioli]]'' being a unique combination of beans and pasta. Veneto features heavier dishes using exotic spices and sauces. Ingredients like [[stockfish]] or simple marinated [[anchovie]]s are found here as well. Less fish is eaten in Veneto and more meat and [[sausage]]s are preferred such as the famous [[sopressata]] and [[garlic]] [[salami]]. High quality [[vegetable]]s are prized here with red [[radicchio]] from [[Treviso]] being prized as well as [[asparagus]] from [[Bassano del Grappa]].<ref>Piras, 33.</ref>

[[Image:Hungarian goulash.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Goulash]] with [[gnocchi]]]]
Prior to the [[Council of Trent]] in [[1550]] [[Trentino-Alto Adige/S<U+00FC>dtirol]] was known for simplicity in cuisine. When the [[prelate]]s of the [[Church]] came they brought the art of fine cooking to the region. Fresh water fish is a specialty of this region. In later years the cuisine of the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Habsburg Empire]] were adopted. In the Alto Adige [[Alpine]] traditions are embraced which includes [[Slav]], [[Austrian]], and [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] cuisines. [[Goulash]] can again be found here as a regular [[Sunday]] dish. [[Potato]]es, [[dumpling]]s and homemade [[sauerkraut]] called ''crauti''. [[Lard]] is a popular ingredient in this region. The national [[pasta]], [[tomato]]es and [[olive oil]] can be found popularized in this region as well.<ref>Piras, 67.</ref>

===Lombardy===
[[Rice]] is a popular ingredient in [[Lombardy]] often found in [[soup]]s as well as [[risotto]].  Cheese is a popular course with ''[[robiola]]'' and ''[[grana padano]]'' being particularly important (the vast plains of central and southern Lombardy allowing for intensive cattle-raising). For the same reason [[Butter]] is a popular ingredient over oil and [[cream]] in generous amounts are often seen. Single pot dishes are popular here with the working class which take less labor to create.  In the areas of [[Bergamo]], [[Brescia]], and [[Valtellina]] [[polenta]] is popular. In [[Mantua]] village festivals feature ''tortelli di zucca'' ([[ravioli]] with [[pumpkin]] filling) accompanied by melted butter and followed by [[turkey]] stuffed with [[chicken]] or other stewed [[meat]]s.  <ref>Piras, 87.</ref>

===Liguria===

[[Liguria]] highly supports the use of local ingredients, the dishes found in this region will all feature the utmost freshness found in the local produce. Fresh herbs and vegetables as well as seafood find their way into the cuisine. [[Savory]] pies and cakes are popular in the region. [[Onion]]s and [[olive oil]] are found often in the cuisine which were helpful in their addition to [[vitamin C]] for the sailors who may have been lacking in the vitamin on long journeys. The Ligurians, constricted by a lack of terrain suited to wheat productions, made the most of [[chick-pea]] in [[farinata]] (plain or topped with [[onion]], [[artichokes]], [[sausage]], [[cheese]] or young [[anchovies]]) and polenta-like [[panissa]]. Hilly or mountainous districts used [[chestnuts]] as a ready source of carbohydrates and sugar.  Ligurian pastas include ''corzetti'' from the Polcevera valley, ''pansoti'', a triangular shaped ravioli filled with vegetables, ''piccagge'', pasta ribbons made with a small amount of egg and commonly served with [[artichoke]] sauce or [[pesto]], ''[[trenette]]'', made from wholewheat flour cut into long strips and served with pesto, boiled beans and potatoes, and ''trofie'', a Ligurian [[gnocchi]] made from wholegrain flour or white wheat flour, made into a spiral shape and cooked with beans and potatoes and often tossed in pesto.<ref>Piras, 167, 177.</ref>

===Lazio===
[[Image:Gnocchi with truffle.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Gnocchi]]]]
Hearty pasta dishes find their way into the cuisine of [[Lazio]], like the renowned [[amatriciana]] pasta dressing, based on spicy [[Chili pepper|red pepper]] and [[guanciale]], a kind of bacon-like cold cut (with more meat and less fat). The region prides itself on being able to use the lesser known cuts of pork and beef in tasty dishes, with examples in preparations like the entrail-based [[pajata]] and [[coda alla vaccinara]]. While these are memento to the ingenuity of plebeians and peasants having to make-do with little resources several other dishes are derived from the tables of Roman patricians, Popes and cardinals, thus relying on much more prized and valuable ingredients. Some [[Jewish]] influence can also be seen in the cuisine, with Jews having been part of Roman milieu since the times of [[Vespasianus]]. Local vegetables, especially [[globe artichoke]]s, are popular in the Roman cuisine.<ref>Piras, 291.</ref>

===Abruzzo and Molise===
[[Image:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|left|125px|[[Saffron]]]]
[[Chili]]es (''peperoncini'') are seen in the cuisine of [[Abruzzo]] where they are called ''diavolini'' ("little devils") for the spicy heat they add to dishes. ''[[Centerba]]'' ("Hundred Herbs") is a strong, spicy herbal liqueur drunk by the local people here. [[Pasta]], [[meat]], and [[vegetable]]s are central to the cuisine of [[Abruzzo]] and [[Molise]]. [[Lamb]] can be seen here often and is frequently and successfully combined with pasta. A special tool used to cut the local pasta is the ''chitarra'' (literally "guitar"), a fine stringed tool that the dough is pressed through. [[Saffron]] is a favorite spice of the region, grown in the town of [[L'Aquila]]. Although its popularity has  slightly waned in recent years it can still be seen in some dishes which are central to Italian cuisine.<ref>Piras, 319.</ref>

===Basilicata===
[[Pork]] is an integral part of [[Basilicata]]'s cuisine, often made into sausages or roasted on a spit by home cooks. Mutton and lamb are also popular meats in the region. Pasta is another common ingredient to the cuisine here, made from duram wheat and water. The accompanying sauces for the pasta are generally of the meat or vegetable based variety. Spicy [[peperoncini]] are also popular in Basilicata. The bitter [[digestif]] ''Amaro Lucano'' is from this region, but is actually popular all over Italy.<ref>Piras, 383.</ref>

===Calabria===
[[Image:Melon.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Different [[Melon]] proliferate in Calabria]]
The cuisine of [[Calabria]] has been highly affected by the constant conquerors and visitors of the region's past. The Arabs introduced oranges, lemons, raisins, artichokes and egg plants. [[Cistercian]] monks introduced agricultural practices to the region along with their skills in processing dairy products. French rule under the [[House of Anjou]], and later [[Napoleon]], along with Spanish influence, affected the language and culinary skills as seen in the naming conventions of items such as cake, ''gat<U+00F2>'', from the French ''gateau''. In time the region has taken on its own characteristics and distinct regional cuisine based on these influences. Seafood proliferates in the cuisine due to its orientation to the coast line with [[swordfish]] being of note along with [[shrimp]], [[lobster]], [[sea urchin]], [[squid]] and others. [[Melon]]s also grow well in this region with [[watermelon]], charleston gray, crimson sweet, [[cantelope]], ''tendrale verde'', ''piel de sapo'' and ''invernale giallo'' being popularly served in a chilled ''Macedonia di frutta'' (fruit salad) or wrapped in [[Prosciutto]].<ref>Piras, 401.</ref>

===Sicily===

{{Main|Cuisine of Sicily}}
[[Sicily]] is another region filled with culinary influences because of its location. The influence of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]]s can be found here: [[Dionysus]] has been said to have introduced wine to the region. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] later conquered the island and introduced lavish dishes based on [[goose]]. The [[Byzantines]] introduced sweet and sour flavors while during the 10th and 11th centuries the Arabs brought [[apricot]]s, [[sugar]], [[citrus]], sweet melons, [[rice]], [[saffron]], [[raisin]]s, [[nutmeg]], [[clove]], [[black pepper]], and [[cinnamon]] which are all still seen in the cuisine today. The [[Normans]] and [[Hohenstaufen]]s introduced a fondness for meat dishes. The [[Spain|Spanish]] introduced numerous items from the New World including [[cocoa]], [[maize]], [[turkey]], [[tomatoes]] and other produce items. [[Tuna]], [[sea bream]], [[sea bass]], [[cuttlefish]], [[swordfish]] and other seafood available off the coastline is an integral part of the modern cuisine.<ref>Piras, 423.</ref>

===Sardinia===
[[Sardinia]] was a region once fought over fiercely by many powers, the coastal cuisine of fish and seafood has only flourished after much history had passed as the inhabitants of the region wisely kept away from the coastline so highly cherished by invading traders of the area. Today rock lobster, [[scampi]], squid, tuna, sardines and other seafood and fish figure prominently into the cuisine. Suckling pig and wild boar figure prominently, often roasted on the spit or boiled in hearty stews of beans, vegetables and thickened with dry bread rounding out the meal. Fresh herbs such as mint and myrtle are popular in dishes as well. Sardinian bread is made in a drier format, which keeps longer than high-moisture breads as well, examples include ''civraxiu'', ''coccoi pinatus'', a highly decorative bread and ''pistoccu'' made with flour and water only, meant to travel distances with herders but served at home often with tomatoes, basil, oregano, garlic and a strong cheese.<ref>Piras, 457, 460.</ref>

==Meal structure==
Meals are structured in a cyclical order in Italy and variable contain no less than 3-4 courses.  Meals are seen as a time to spend with family and friends instead of immediate sustenance, as such the regular daily meals can be a bit longer than other cultures.  During holidays, many family feasts will last for many hours, if not the entire day.

In many homes today the traditional Italian menu is kept for high days and special events (as weddings) while the everyday menu only includes the first and second course, the side dish and coffee. One notable aspect of an Italian meal, is that the ''primo'' or first course, is usually the more filling dish and will consist of either risotto or pasta, both being rich in [[carbohydrate]]s. Modern Italian cuisine also includes single courses (all-in-one courses), providing carbohydrates and proteins at the same time (e.g. pasta and legumes).

;''Antipasti'': literally "before (the) food", hot or cold [[appetizer]]s
;''Primo'': "first course", usually consists of a hot dish like [[pasta]], [[risotto]], [[gnocchi]], [[polenta]] or [[soup]].
;''Secondo'': "second course", the main dish, usually fish or meat. Traditionally veal, pork and chicken  are the most commonly used meat, at least in the North, though beef has become more popular since World War II and wild game is very popular, particularly in [[Tuscany]]. Fish are those which are caught locally.
;''Contorno'': "side dish", may consist of a salad or cooked vegetables. A traditional menu features salad along with the main course.
;''Formaggio'' and ''frutta'': "cheese and fruits", the first dessert, usually served together
;''Dolce'': "dessert", such as cakes and cookies
;''Caff<U+00E8>'': coffee/espresso
;''Digestivo'': "digestives", liquors/liqueurs ([[grappa]], [[amaro (drink)|amaro]], [[limoncello]]) sometimes referred to as ''[[ammazzacaff<U+00E8>]]'' ("coffee killer")

==Dining out==
[[Image:Italian trattoria sign.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Trattoria]]]]
Italy offers many options for dining out or getting a drink.  Each type of establishment has a defined role and traditionally sticks to it.<ref>Evans, 198-200.</ref>  Below is a listing of various dining and drinking establishments one might find in Italy.

'''Places to dine out'''
*[[Agriturismo]] - Working farms that often offer accommodations and meals.  Often the meals are served to guests only.  Marked by green and gold sign with a knife and fork on it.<ref>Evans, 200.</ref>
*[[Bar (establishment)|Bar]]/Caff<U+00E9> - Popular locations which serve coffee, soft drinks, juice and alcohol.  Traditional hours are from 6am to 10pm.  Common foods sold include [[brioche]], [[panini]], [[tramezzini]] or [[spuntini]] (snacks) which can include [[olive]]s, potato crisps and small pieces of [[frittata]].<ref>Evans, 200.</ref>
*Birreria - A bar that offers beer found in central and northern regions of Italy.<ref>Evans, 200.</ref>
*Frasca/Locanda - [[Friulian]] wine producers that often open for the evening and many stay open late offering food along with their wines.<ref>Evans, 200.</ref>
*Osteria - Focused on simple food of the local region, usually only having a verbal menu.  Many are open at night only but some open for lunch from 12:30 to 3pm.  They will then reopen at 7pm for dinner with a late closing time.<ref>Evans, 201.</ref>
*Paninoteca - Sandwich specialty shop open during the day.<ref>Evans, 201.</ref>
*[[Pizzeria]] - Wood fired pizzas are a specialty of Italy.<ref>Evans, 203</ref>

==Coffee==
[[Image:Linea doubleespresso.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Espresso]]
{{see also|espresso}}
[[Image:Coffee Moka.JPG|thumb|left|150px|''Moka per il caff<U+00E8>'']]
Italian style coffee (''caff<U+00E8>''), also known as [[espresso]] is made from the same coffee beans as any other style of coffee. However, beans prepared for espresso are usually roasted dark, and are often a blend of coffee beans of various origins. Common misconception is that espresso contains more caffeine than coffee but the opposite is true.  The longer roasting period for the beans extracts more of the caffeine and thus giving espresso roast beans less caffeine content.The modern espresso machine invented in 1937 by Achille Gaggia uses a pump and pressure system with water heated up to 194-203<U+00B0>F and forced with high pressure through a few grams of finely ground espresso roast beans with a pressure of nine bars in 25-30 seconds resulting in about 25 milliliters or two tablespoons of liquid.<ref>Piras, 300.</ref>  

Home espresso makers are much more simplistic, but work under the same principle.  ''La Napolentana'' is a four part stove-top unit with grounds placed inside a filter loosely, the kettle portion is filled with water and once boiling, the unit is inverted to drip through the grounds.  The ''Moka per il caff<U+00E8>'' is a stove-top unit that is placed on the stove-top with loosely packed grounds, the water rises much like a percolator in the unit and then drips back through the grounds as.<ref>Piras, 301.</ref>

It is usually served in a [[demitasse]] in relatively small quantity. [[Caff<U+00E8> macchiato]] is a topped with a bit of steamed milk or foam; [[ristretto]] is made with less water, and is stronger; [[cappuccino]] is mixed or topped with steamed, mostly frothy, milk. It is generally considered a morning beverage; [[caffelatte]] is generally equal parts espresso and steamed milk, similar to [[caf<U+00E9> au lait]], and is typically served in a large cup. Latte macchiato (spotted milk) is a glass of warm milk with a bit of coffee.

==Wine==
[[Image:DOCG.jpg|thumb|right|150px|DOCG label on wine bottle]]
{{main article|Italian wine}}
Italy produces the largest amount of wine in the world.  It is also the largest exporter and consumer of wine as well.  Two-thirds of the wine produced is bulk wine used for blending in [[France]] and [[Germany]].  The amount of wine distilled into spirits in Italy exceeds the production of wine in the entirety of the [[New World]].  As seen, although Italy produces the largest amount of wine in the world, approximately 25% of it is of quality that is labeled and put into bottles for individual sale.<ref>Koplan, 301.</ref>  Fine wine is made in most regions of Italy.  Much like the variety of regional cuisines of Italy, the wines are extremely varied as well with twenty separate wine regions.<ref>Koplan, 311.</ref>

The top wine's in Italy are highly appealing and are generally extremely food-friendly wines.  Those producing great wines have been attempting to wash away the old image of jug wines so often associated with Italian wine production.  In order to promote this process the Italian government created a number of laws to regulate the wine industry.  The ''[[Denominazione di Origine Controllata]]'' ([[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]]) law passed in 1963 regulates the place of origin.  The laws associate with DOC have been regularly updated.  One of the updates in 1980, created the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata|Denominiazione di Origine Controllatta e Garantita]]'' ([[DOCG]]).  DOCG is reserved for only the best wines in Italy.  These laws regulate place of origin, quality, production methods and the type of grape used to produce the wine.  The designation of ''[[Indicazione Geografica Tipica]]'' (IGT) is a slightly less restrictive designation regulating place which is considered to help a wine maker graduate to the (DOC) level.<ref>Koplan, 307-308.</ref>

==Holiday cuisine==
Italians celebrate each holiday with a different cuisine, each in turn having a specific meaning. Moreover every single region has its own dedicated holiday recipes, having preserved them along centuries of political division which lasted until the 19th century.  In [[Sicily]] and other Italian communities worldwide, on March 19, La Festa di San Giuseppe ([[St. Joseph's Day]]), thanks are given to [[St. Joseph]] for preventing a famine in Sicily during the [[Middle Ages]].  The [[fava bean]] was the crop which saved the population from starvation, and is a traditional part of St. Joseph's Day altars and traditions. Other customs celebrating this festival include wearing red clothing, eating Sicilian pastries known as [[zeppole]] and giving food to the needy.

On [[Christmas Eve]] a symbolic fast is observed (the so-called "cena di magro", the "light dinner") excluding beef, pork and lamb meat and including many courses based mainly on fish and other seafood, but also on snails and frogs.  On [[Christmas]] Italians often serve [[tortellini]] as a first course. The typical cakes of the Christmas season are [[panettone]] and [[pandoro]], with people often being partial to one but not the other.On [[Easter|Easter Sunday]], lamb-based dishes are commonly served throughout both northern and southern Italy. Typical at Easter Sunday in [[Umbria]] and Tuscany is also a breakfast with Salami, boiled eggs, wine and Easter Cakes and pizzas.
