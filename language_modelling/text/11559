'''''[[National Lampoon]]'s European Vacation''''' is a [[1985 in film|1985]] [[comedy film]]. The  second film in the ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation|Vacation]]'' series, it was directed by [[Amy Heckerling]] and stars [[Chevy Chase]] and [[Beverly D'Angelo]]. [[Dana Hill]] and [[Jason Lively]] replace [[Dana Barron]] and [[Anthony Michael Hall]] as Griswold children Audrey and Rusty. After Anthony Michael Hall declined to reprise his role (he decided to star in ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]'' instead), [[film producer|producer]]s decided to recast both children.

This was the only ''Vacation'' movie that did not feature [[Randy Quaid]]'s "Cousin Eddie" character.  In the opening "Pig in a Poke" sequence, the family's name is shown as "Griswald", though in every other instance and film it is spelled "Griswold".

==Plot==

The film's plot is another family misadventure, full of over-the-top [[slapstick]]. Chase and D'Angelo again portray the married couple Clark and Ellen Griswold, living in suburban [[Chicago]] with two children, Rusty and Audrey.  The family competes in a game show called "Pig in a Poke" (based on [[Family Feud]], but with the families wearing pig costumes) and wins an all-expense-paid trip to [[Europe]], flying [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] Airways.  In a whirlwind tour of western Europe, chaos of all sorts ensues. Their fleabag London hotel desk clerk is a sloppy, tattooed Cockney wearing a tank top ([[Mel Smith]]). Clark drives his family endlessly round the busy [[Lambeth Bridge]] roundabout for hours, unable to maneuver his way out of traffic, mentioning the Big Ben clock and Parliament with each pass.  His wrong-way driving habits cause him to repeatedly knock over and injure the same frightened bicyclist ([[Eric Idle]]) who reappears in different scenes as if by coincidence, each time wearing more bandages than in the scene before. At [[Stonehenge]], Clark backs their car into a priceless, ancient stone monolith, knocking all the stones down like dominoes, which they do not even notice happened as they happily leave the scene.  (While the family are at Stonehenge, Clark shouts for Rusty who is standing right behind him. Rusty then replies, 'Yeah Dad?'. This conversation is a [[Callback (comedy)|callback]] to a similar one which took place in ''National Lampoon's Vacation'' after Clark crashed the car in the middle of the desert.)

In [[Paris]], Rusty throws his beret cap off the [[Eiffel Tower]] observation deck, causing a lady's [[dachshund]] to jump off after it; later young Rusty meets a hooker at a bawdy Paris can-can dance show. While in Paris, the family's [[video camera]] is stolen by a passerby whom Clark had asked to take a picture of the family. Also Clark, with his terrible [[French language|French]] manages to insult every native Frenchman.

The Griswolds burst in on a bewildered, elderly German village couple who they mistakenly think are relatives but who serve them dinner anyhow, not knowing each other's languages. Clark manages to turn a lively thigh-slapping [[Bavaria|Bavarian]] folk dance stage performance into an all-out street brawl, after which he, fleeing hastily, gets their [[Citroen DS]] stuck in a too-narrow medieval archway after knocking down several street vendors' stands. The family members get on each others' nerves while riding together in a train compartment. 

In [[Rome]], Ellen angrily discovers that private sexy photos of her from the family's previously stolen video camera have been used in a billboard advertising a [[pornographic]] movie, leaving her completely humiliated. After screaming her anger at Clark, Ellen storms off and encounters a man to whom she confesses her recent troubles, unaware that he is a thief; the man then gets her drunk and tries to have sex with Ellen. Believing that he's trying to [[rape]] her, Ellen tries to make a break for it, but when she resists, she is kidnapped by him and his fellow thieves, who also are holding a store manager for ransom, prompting Clark to rescue her.  At the end while flying back to the USA, Clark causes the plane to "knock" the Statute of Libery's torch upside down.     

Cameo appearances are made by [[John Astin]] (playing game show host "Kent Winkdale"), [[Moon Unit Zappa]], [[Robbie Coltrane]], [[Maureen Lipman]], [[Leslie Phillips]], [[Ballard Berkeley]], [[Eric Idle]] and a musical appearance by [[The Power Station]] ("Some Like It Hot").
