{{dablink|This article is about the 2007 tropical storm; for other storms of this name, see [[Hurricane Gabrielle]]}}
'''Tropical Storm Gabrielle''' was a short-lived [[tropical cyclone]] that passed over [[North Carolina]] before tracking out to sea. The seventh named storm of the [[2007 Atlantic hurricane season]], Gabrielle developed as a [[subtropical cyclone]] on September 8 about 385&nbsp;miles (625&nbsp;km) southeast of [[Cape Lookout, North Carolina]]. Unfavorable [[wind shear]] impacted the storm for much of its duration, although a temporary decrease in the shear allowed the cyclone to become a tropical storm. On September 9, Gabrielle made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] at [[Cape Lookout National Seashore]] in the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] with winds of 60&nbsp;mph (90&nbsp;km/h). Turning to the northeast, the storm quickly weakened and dissipated on September 11. 

In advance of the storm, [[tropical cyclone watches and warnings]] were issued for coastal areas, while rescue teams and the U.S. Coast Guard were put on standby. The storm dropped heavy rainfall near its immediate landfall location but little precipitation elsewhere. Along the coast, high waves, [[rip current]]s, and [[storm surge]] were reported. Slight localized flooding was reported. Gusty winds also occurred, though no wind damage was reported. Overall damage was minor, and there were no fatalities.

Subsequent to the flight, the center became slightly better organized, and based on the large wind field and the presence of an upper-level low to its west-southwest, the [[National Hurricane Center]] classified the system as Subtropical Storm Gabrielle early on September 8 while located about 385&nbsp;miles (625&nbsp;km) southeast of [[Cape Lookout, North Carolina]].<ref name="disc1">{{cite web|author=Beven & Roberts|date=September 8, 2007|title=Subtropical Storm Gabrielle Discussion One|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-09-07|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al07/al072007.discus.001.shtml?}}</ref>

Upon becoming a [[subtropical cyclone]], Gabrielle was located in an area of cooler air to its north, dry air to its south and west, southerly wind shear, and cooler water temperatures along its path.<ref name="disc1"/> Despite these unfavorable conditions, a curved convective band developed in its northern and western quadrants,<ref name="disc2">{{cite web|author=Mainelli & Avila|date=September 8, 2007|title=Subtropical Storm Gabrielle Discussion Two|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-09-08|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al07/al072007.discus.002.shtml?}}</ref> and the circulation became better defined.<ref name="disc3">{{cite web|author=Knabb|date=September 8, 2007|title=Subtropical Storm Gabrielle Discussion Three|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-09-08|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al07/al072007.discus.003.shtml?}}</ref> Subsequently, the rainbands in its northeastern quadrant dissipated, leaving the well-defined center far removed from the convection. By later that day, the circulation began to become more involved with the remaining convection. Based on evidence of a weak [[tropical cyclone#mechanics|warm-core]], the system was designated as Tropical Storm Gabrielle late on September 8 about 185&nbsp;miles (300&nbsp;km) southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina.<ref name="disc4">{{cite web|author=Knabb|date=September 8, 2007|title=Tropical Storm Gabrielle Discussion Four|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-09-08|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al07/al072007.discus.004.shtml?}}</ref>

==Preparations==
Upon becoming a subtropical cyclone, the National Hurricane Center issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm watch]] from [[Edisto Beach, South Carolina]] to [[Oregon Inlet]] in [[North Carolina]], including the [[Pamlico Sound]].<ref name="pa1">{{cite web|author=Beven & Roberts|date=September 7, 2007|title=Subtropical Storm Gabrielle Public Advisory One|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-09-07|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al07/al072007.public.001.shtml?}}</ref> As the storm approached the coast, the watch south of [[Cape Fear, North Carolina]] was discontinued, and a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] was issued from [[Surf City, North Carolina]] northward to the North Carolina&ndash;[[Virginia]] state border; a watch was also issued northward to [[Cape Charles Light]] on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]], and to [[New Point Comfort]] on the western shore of the [[Chesapeake Bay]],<ref name="pa3">{{cite web|author=Knabb|date=September 8, 2007|title=Subtropical Storm Gabrielle Public Advisory Three|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-09-08|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al07/al072007.public.003.shtml?}}</ref> which was upgraded to a warning the next day.<ref name="pa5">{{cite web|author=Beven|date=September 8, 2007|title=Tropical Storm Gabrielle Public Advisory Five|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-09-08|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/al07/al072007.public.005.shtml?}}</ref>

Initially, uncertainty in Gabrielle's track led the National Hurricane Center's five-day [[track forecast cone]] to include the Mid-Atlantic, southeastern New York, and southern New England.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Gabrielle Graphics Archive|year=2007|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2008-11-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/graphics/al07/loop_5W.shtml}}</ref> Forecasters predicted rough surf and rip currents, prompting the [[Coast Guard]] to preform reparations in the Northeastern United States. On [[Cape Cod]], [[Massachusetts]], an [[HU-25 Falcon]] jet flew along the coastline, broadcasting storm advisories to offshore vessels.

==Impact==

By early on September 9, the outer [[squall#tropical cyclones|rainbands]] began affecting southeastern [[North Carolina]].<ref name="pa5"/> Sustained winds of tropical storm force from the storm occurred along coastline, unofficially reaching 44&nbsp;miles per hour (71&nbsp;km/h) at [[Frisco, North Carolina|Frisco]].

Two offshore ships observed tropical storm-force winds, though the reports were considered to be over-estimated.<ref name="tcr"/> 

In some locations, the rainfall led to flooding, which prevented farmers from harvesting crops.

When the cyclone was named Gabrielle, it was the fourth time that the name was used for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean. The name was used previously in 1989 for [[Hurricane Gabrielle (1989)|Hurricane Gabrielle]], in 1995 for [[Tropical Storm Gabrielle (1995)|Tropical Storm Gabrielle]], and in 2001 for [[Hurricane Gabrielle (2001)|Hurricane Gabrielle]]. Because the damage from Tropical Storm Gabrielle was minimal, the name Gabrielle was not retired and is on the list of names for the [[2013 Atlantic hurricane season]].<ref name="names">{{cite web|title=Worldwide Tropical Cyclone Names|year=2007|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2008-09-13|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames.shtml}}</ref> As a relatively weak storm, Gabrielle produced an [[Accumulated Cyclone Energy]] (ACE) of 1.4500.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Levinson|title=2007 Atlantic North Pacific Ocean Tropical Cyclones|year=2007|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=2008-11-03|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/2007/2007-atlantic-trop-cyclones.html}}</ref> This value is an approximation of the kinetic energy used by a tropical system throughout its existence.<ref name="ACE">{{cite web| author=Carl Drews| publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder| date=August 24, 2007 | accessdate=2008-11-02| title=Separating the ACE Hurricane Index into Number, Intensity, and Duration|url=https://webfiles.colorado.edu/drewsc/www/hurricane/SeparatingTheACE.html}}</ref>
