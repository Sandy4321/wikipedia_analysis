The '''1960 [[Winter Olympics]]''', officially known as the '''VIII Olympic Winter Games''', were a winter [[multi-sport event]] held between 18 and 28 February, 1960 in [[Squaw Valley, California (Ski Area Valley)|Squaw Valley]], United States.  Squaw Valley was awarded the bid during the 50th IOC meeting in 1955, which was a surprise choice. Nearly nothing existed in Squaw Valley, which meant all of the venues and infrastructure had to be built or improved between 1956 and 1960 at a cost of $80,000,000. The Games featured the first athlete's village and was designed to be intimate, allowing spectators and athletes the ability to walk to nearly all the venues.  The [[Olympic Games ceremony|opening and closing ceremonies]] were produced by [[Walt Disney]] and televised by [[CBS]].  The 1960 Games were the first in which television broadcast rights were sold to the highest bidder.  It was the first time in 28&nbsp;years that an Olympic Games had been held in North America.  

Thirty nations and 665 athletes competed in four sports and 27 events.  Women's [[speed skating]] and [[biathlon]] made their Olympic debuts.  The organizers felt as though the participation in the [[bobsled]] events did not warrant the cost to build the venue, so for the first and only time bobsled was not on the Olympic program.  The [[Soviet Union at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Soviet Union]] dominated the medal count winning 21 medals, 7 of which were gold.  Soviet speed skaters [[Yevgeny Grishin]] and [[Lidiya Skoblikova]] were the only multiple gold medalists.  [[Sweden at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Swedish]] lumberjack [[Sixten Jernberg]] added a gold and silver to the 4 medals he won at the [[1956 Winter Olympics|1956 Winter Games]].  He would win three more in [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964]] to finish his Olympic career with 9 medals, becoming the most decorated Winter Olympian to date.

Politics had an impact in the lead up to the Games as tensions between the United States and Soviet Union intensified.  The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) was forced to debate the participation of China, Taiwan, North Korea and East Germany due to issues related to the [[Cold War]].  In 1957 the United States government threatened to deny visas to any athletes from [[Communism|Communist]] countries.  In response to IOC declared that it would revoke Squaw Valley's right to host the 1960 Games.  Bowing to international pressure the United States allowed athletes from Communist countries entry for the Games. 

==Host selection==
{{main|Bids for the 1960 Winter Olympics}}
Squaw Valley was an unexpected selection for the 1960 Winter Olympics. [[Innsbruck]], Austria had submitted a compelling bid and was considered the favorite while Squaw Valley was a struggling ski resort with minimal facilities.<ref name=squawusa>{{cite web|title=The VIII Winter Olympic Games|publisher=Squaw Valley Ski Corporation|url=http://www.squaw.com/winter/history_olympics.html|accessdate=2011-07-29}}</ref><ref name=Findling338>Findling & Pelle (2004), p. 338</ref> The only inhabitant and homeowner in the area was Alexander Cushing, who was inspired to an Olympic bid by a newspaper article mentioning that [[Reno, Nevada]] and [[Anchorage, Alaska]] had expressed interest in the Games.<ref name=squawusa/><ref name=squawioc>{{cite web|title=Squaw Valley 1960|publisher=International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/squaw-valley-1960-winter-olympics|accessdate=2011-07-29}}</ref> Cushing, president of the Squaw Valley Development Company, petitioned California Governor [[Goodwin Knight]] to support a bid to host the Olympic Games.  Knight's administration agreed and recommended that the [[California Legislature]] appropriate [[USD|$]]1,000,000 to the effort.<ref name=svor19>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 19</ref>  Based on the financial support received from the State of California the United State Olympic Committee (USOC) approved the bid on January 7, 1955.  Cushing and the USOC received a resolution passed by the [[United State Congress]] and signed by President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], calling on the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) to consider Squaw Valley's bid for the 1960 Games.<ref name=svor19/>  Preliminary reports were drafted and submitted to the IOC who was considering bids from [[Innsbruck]], [[St. Moritz]], Switzerland and [[Chamonix]], France.  Squaw Valley's bid was accepted with a caveat by IOC president [[Avery Brundage]] who warned the Organizing Committee that unless more funds were secured by April 1956, the bid would be awarded to Innsbruck.<ref>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), pp.19<U+2013>20</ref>  Another $4,000,000 was committed by the State Legislature, which met Brundage's requirements and on April 4, 1956 the right to host the 1960 Winter Olympics was officially awarded to Squaw Valley.<ref>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 20</ref>  Competitors and officials from European nations were incensed with the selection, they felt that the alpine ski courses were not up to specifications and that the altitude would prove to stressful on the athletes.<ref name=sroverview>{{cite web|title=1960 Squaw Valley Winter Games|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1960/|accessdate=2011-08-02}}</ref>

==Organization==
[[Image:SquawValley-Olympic-sign.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sign outside Olympic Village at Squaw Valley]]
At the time the Squaw Valley resort consisted of one chair lift, two rope tows, and a fifty-room lodge. Cushing presented the site as a blank canvas of unspoiled environment, where a world-class ski resort could be constructed.<ref name=Findling338/>  The obscurity of the location was underscored at the [[Olympic Games ceremony|closing ceremonies]] of the [[1956 Winter Olympics]].  The mayor of the current host city traditionally passed a flag to the mayor of the next host city signalling the transfer of the Games.  Since Squaw Valley was an unincorporated village it had no city government.  [[John Garland]], an IOC member from California, was asked to stand in and received the flag from the mayor of [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]].<ref name=Findling338/> 

After the Games were awarded to Squaw Valley the California Olympic Commission was formed to take the lead in organizing the Games.<ref name=Findling339>Findling & Pelle (2004), p. 339</ref>  Venues, an Olympic Village, and infrastructure had to be constructed and expanded in a four-year time frame.  With the expansion of roads, bridges, water and electrical capacity the resort of Squaw Valley became the city of Squaw Valley.  Hotels, restaurants, administration buildings, a Sheriff's office and a sewage pumping and treatment plant were all constructed to support the influx of visitors for the Games.<ref name=svor27-28>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), pp. 27<U+2013>28</ref> Organizers wanted the Olympics to be intimate with nearly all of the venues close to one another and the athletes' village.<ref name=sroverview/>  The [[Blyth Arena|Blyth Memorial Ice Arena]], three outside skating rinks, a 400-meter speed skating oval, and four dormitories to house athletes had to be constructed.  One venue deemed impractical to build was the bobsled run.  Organizers felt the lack of possible entrants and the high cost of building the run were sufficient deterrants to leave the bobsled events out of the 1960 Olympic program.<ref name=Findling339/><ref name=bobsled>{{cite web|title=Everything you need to know about bobsled|publisher=The Washington Post|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/olympics1998/sport/bobsled/articles/bobsled.htm|accessdate=2011-07-29}}</ref>  

Several design innovations and new technologies were used for the 1960 Games.  The speed skating, figure skating and ice hockey events were held on artificial ice for the first time in Olympic history.  A refrigeration plant capabable of heating 4,800 homes had to be built to generate and maintain the ice.  The heat generated from the refrigeration plant was used to warm spectators, provide hot water, and melt the snow off of roofs.  New timing equipment provided by [[Longines]] was installed that used a [[quartz]] clock to measure to the hundreths of a second.  [[IBM]] provided a computer that was capable of tabulating results and printing them in English and French.  Blyth arena, site of the opening and closing ceremonies, the figure skating and ice hockey competitions, was built with a {{convert|22|in|cm|abbr=on}} gap in the roof, which would slide closed as the weather cooled and the cables supporting the roof contracted.<ref name=ps138>{{cite journal|title=Backstage at Winter Olympics|last=Shipler|first=Guy|work=Popular Science|date=February 1960|pages=137-138|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vyoDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA136&dq=ibm+1960+winter+olympics&hl=en#v=onepage&q=ibm%201960%20winter%20olympics&f=false|accessdate=2011-08-12}}</ref>

Funding for Cushings initial bid to the IOC came from the California Legislature and investors in the "Squaw Valley Development Company" <U+2013> owners of the existing resort.<ref name=Findling338/>  To fund the construction the organizers turned to the federal government for assistance.  Squaw Valley was the first Games in the United States to receive federal funding; providing around a quarter of the $80 million required to host the event.  The monies were used to build the sports arena and provide military support during the Games.<ref name=ungar>{{cite book|title=Olympic Games: Federal Government Provides Significant Funding and Support|last=Ungar|first=Bernard L.|publisher=United States General Accounting Office|location=Washington D.C.|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5g2gPLrnPpAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Olympic+Games:+Federal+Government+Provides+Significant+Funding+and+Support&hl=en&ei=Oj4zToaUPNDSiALgg-jDCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=squaw&f=false|date=2000|page=19|isbn=0756715016|accessdate=2011-07-29}}</ref>  Further funding was secured from private sponsorships and from the State of California.  Governor Knight and his successor [[Edmund "Pat" Brown]] remained behind the project, seeing it as a means to showcase the state of California to the world.<ref name=Findling339/>

===Television===
Television was not new to the Olympic Games, broadcasts of events to international audiences had begun at the 1956 Games.<ref name=tv71>Toohey and Veal (2008), p. 71</ref>  What was unprecedented was the sale of exclusive rights to broadcast the Games.  The Organizing Committee decided to sell the television broadcast rights to [[CBS]] for $50,000.<ref name=worth>{{cite web|title=Are Olympic TV rights worth the price?|last=Spence|first=Jim|date=November 20, 1988|publisher=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/20/sports/views-of-sport-are-olympic-tv-rights-worth-the-price.html|accessdate=2011-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Olympics and Television|publisher=Museum of Broadcast Communications|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=olympicsand|accessdate=2011-07-29}}</ref>  Unknown at the time was how lucrative the sale of broadcast rights would become.   For example, CBS purchased the rights to broadcast the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] for $550,000.<ref name=worth/>  During the Games CBS broadcast 31&nbsp;hours of television focusing on ice hockey, speed skating, figure skating, alpine skiing and ski jumping.<ref>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 73</ref>  The impact of television was felt during the Games; in the men's slalom event, officials who were unsure if a skier had missed a gate asked CBS if they could review tape of the event.  This request gave CBS the idea for what is now known as [[instant replay]].<ref name=squawioc/>

==Politics==
[[File:Avery Brundage.jpg|thumb|right|IOC President Avery Brundage]]
Athletic competition between the Soviet Union and United States had grown intense during the 1950's.  Politically their opposing idealogies and interests in nations such as Germany, China and Korea created a delicate situation as the 1960 Winter Games approached.  Of particular interest was the question of whether China would be allowed to participate.<ref name=espy61>Espy (1979), p. 61</ref>  China last participated at the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Summer Games]] but had since withdrawn from the IOC due to a dispute over Taiwan's participation as a separate country.<ref>{{cite web|title=China and the Olympic Movement|last=Xiao|first=Li|publisher=China Internet Information Center|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/null/116819.htm|accessdate=2011-08-04}}</ref>  The United State supported Taiwan while the Soviet Union stood behind China.  Given the fact that the 1960 Games were to be held in America, there was concern among IOC members that the United States would not allow China, or any other [[Communism|Communist]] country to participate.<ref name=espy61/>  In 1957 IOC president Avery Brundage announced that if the United States refused entry to any country recognized by the IOC, then they would revoke Squaw Valley's invitation to host the Games.<ref>This was coupled with a warning that he would resign from the presidency if restrictions were not lifted</ref><ref>Espy (1979) pp. 61<U+2013>62</ref>  Bowing to international pressure, the United States allowed athletes from Communist countries to participate.  China continued to demand that Taiwan be expelled from the IOC, demands that were refused until China broke off relations ending any hope that they would participate in 1960.<ref>Espy (1979), pp. 62<U+2013>63</ref>

Problems similar to the issue with China broke out over North Korea and East Germany.  Prior to the [[Korean War]] the IOC had recognized the Olympic committee of Korea, which was headquartered in [[Seoul]].  North Korea was not recognized as a separate country by the IOC who maintained the existence of one Olympic committee.  A [[United Team of Germany|unified team]] compromise was proposed but rejected, which meant only athletes from South Korea participated due to their prior recognition.<ref>Espy (1979), pp. 66-67</ref>  Pressure for full recognition of East Germany continued despite the fact that both East and West Germany had participated as a unified team in 1956.  Part of the negotiations for a unified German team was that they be represented by a neutral flag.  Initially West German officials refused to agree to this stipulation citing the fact that the West German flag had been used at both the 1956 Winter and Summer Games.  Eventually the neutral flag was adopted and a unified German team participated.<ref> Espy (1979), p. 67</ref>

==Events==
The Games were held from 18 to 28 February.<ref name=squawioc/>  There were 27 events in eight sports contested.<ref name=sroverview/>  The sport of [[Biathlon at the 1960 Winter Olympics|biathlon]] was added to the program as was speed skating events for women.  After a poll was taken indicating that only nine countries would send a bobsled team, the organizers determined that bobsled would be removed from the Olympic program.  Despite petitions from the [[International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation]] to reconsider, the organizers felt they could not justify the costs of constructing a bobsled run for nine competing nations. It would be the only time in Winter Olympic history that the bobsled events were not held.<ref name=bobsled/><ref name=sroverview/>

===Opening ceremonies===
[[Image:Flagpole Egmont Copenhagen.jpg|200px|thumb|left|A plaque on an official flagpole commissioned by Walt Disney for the 1960 Games]]
The chairman of the "Pagentry Committee" was [[Walt Disney]], who was responsible for producing both the opening and closing ceremonies.<ref name=sroverview/>  He planned on an opening that would include 5,000 entertainers, the release of 2,000 pigeons, and a military gun salute of eight shots, one for each of the previous Winter Olympic Games.<ref>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), pp. 53-55</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Walt Disney:A Biography|last1=Krasniewicz|first1=Louise|last2=Blitz|first2=Michael|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Santa Barbara, USA|date=2010|page=132|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lZ3vTgpHgFoC&pg=PA132&dq=1960+winter+olympics+disney&hl=en#v=onepage&q=1960%20winter%20olympics%20disney&f=false|isbn=978-0-313-35830-2}}</ref>  The opening ceremonies were held on 18 February 1960 at Blyth Arena in the midst of a blizzard.  Heavy snow fell the morning of the 18th and caused traffic problems that delayed the ceremony by an hour.  The festivities began with a sustained drum role as the flags of each participating nation were raised on specially designed flag poles.  As the Greek standard bearer led the 30 participating countries in the traditional Parade of Nations the weather broke and the rest of the two-hour ceremony proceeded in sunshine.  Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] represented the United States government and declared the Games open.<ref name=sror53>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 53</ref>   The Olympic flame was lit by [[Ken Henry (speed skater)|Kenneth Henry]], Olympic champion of the 500&nbsp;meter speed skating race at the [[1952 Winter Olympics]] in [[Oslo]].  The Olympic oath was taken by [[Carol Heiss]] on behalf of all the athletes.  As the national delegations exited the stadium fireworks concluded the ceremonies.<ref>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 55</ref>

===Ice hockey===

The [[ice hockey]] tournament took place at Blyth Arena and the [[Squaw Valley Olympic Skating Rink]].<ref name=or121>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 121</ref>  Controversy over the amateur status of some of the players overshadowed the event.  [[Canada at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Canadian]] Olympic officials began to protest the use of "professional amateurs" by [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, and especially the [[Soviet Union at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Soviet Union]].  They alleged that the Soviets were giving their elite hockey players phantom jobs in the military that allowed them to play hockey full time, which gave Soviet teams an advantage that they used to dominate Olympic hockey tournaments for nearly 30&nbsp;years.<ref> Caraccioli (2006), p. 48</ref>  This issue started coming to light during the 1960 Games and would culminate in a Canadian boycott of Olympic hockey tournament at the [[1972 Winter Olympics]].<ref> Caraccioli (2006), p. xvii</ref>  The team from the [[United States at the 1960 Winter Olympics|United States]] won an improbable gold medal, defeating the favored Canadian and Soviet teams, who took silver and bronze respectively.<ref name=srhockey>{{cite web|title=Ice Hockey at the 1960 Squaw Valley Winter Games

[[File:Klas Lestander in Squaw Valley 1960.jpg|thumb|left|Klas Lestander during the 1960 Olympic biathlon competition]]
[[Biathlon]] made its Olympic debut in 1960.  The precursor to biathlon, [[military patrol]], was on the Olympic program for the [[1924 Winter Olympics|first Olympic Games]] in 1924.  Subsequently it was a [[demonstration sport]] at the [[1928 Winter Olympics|1928]], [[1936 Winter Olympics|1936]], and [[1948 Winter Olympics]], though the competition was only open to members of the military. Military patrol fell out of favor in 1948 due to antimilitary sentiments in the post [[World War II]] era.<ref>Crego (2003), p. 132</ref>  Biathlon took its place and was instated as a full Olympic sport in 1960.

===Speed skating===
{{main|Speed skating at the 1960 Winter Olympics}}
Women were allowed to compete in the Olympic [[speed skating]] competition for the first time in 1960.  The Soviet Union had requested the inclusion of women's speed skating events in the program for the 1956 Games but the request was rejected by the IOC.<ref>{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the Modern Olympic Movement|last1=Findling|first1=John E.|last2=Pelle|first2=Kimberly D.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport, USA|year=1996|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=InQ_9QaRTlMC&pg=PA258&dq=1956+winter+olympics&ei=9muQSYuiN4vKlQTQtpjGBQ#PPA258,M1|isbn=0-313-28477-6}}</ref>  The issue was revisited for the 1960 Games and since women had been competing internationally since 1936 and there was a World Championship for women's speed skating, the IOC agreed to four events; 500, 1,000, 1,500, and 3,000&nbsp;meters.<ref name=srss>{{cite web|title=Speed Skating at the 1960 Squaw Valley Winter Games|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1960/SSK/|accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref>  The events were held on the Squaw Valley Olympic Skating Rink, which was an outdoor skating oval, and featured artificial ice, a first for the Olympic speed skating competition.  Given the altitude and the artificial ice the rink was the fastest in the world as evidenced by [[Norway at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Norwegian]] [[Knut Johannesen]]<U+2019>s world record in the 10,000&nbsp;meter event.  At 15:46.6 he was the first skater ever to break the 16-minute barrier and eclipsed the previous world record by 46&nbsp;seconds.<ref name=srss/>  Despite Johannesen's victory the Soviets dominated the speeds skating events winning all but two of the races.  [[Yevgeny Grishin]] won both the 500 and 1,500&nbsp;meter races, though he shared the 1,500&nbsp;meter gold medal with Norwegian [[Roald Aas]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Speed Skating at the 1960 Squaw Valley Winter Games:Men's 1,500 metres|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1960/SSK/mens-1500-metres.html|accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref>  [[Lidiya Skoblikova]] from the Soviet Union was the other double gold medalist when she won the 1,500 and 3,000&nbsp;meter events.  [[Poland at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Polish]] skaters [[Helena Pilejczyk]] and [[Elwira Seroczy<U+0144>ska]] placed second and third in the 1,500&nbsp;meter event, earning Poland's only medals of the Games and becoming just the second and third Poles ever to win Winter Olympic medals.<ref>{{cite web|title=Poland|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/POL/|accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref>

===Alpine skiing===
{{main|Alpine skiing at the 1960 Winter Olympics}}
[[File:Ann Heggtveit 1960.jpg|thumb|left|Ann Heggtveit with her Olympic gold medal in the slalom]]
Despite the lack of facilities at Squaw Valley, the resort did have steep mountain slopes in close proximity, resulting in some of the most difficult [[alpine skiing]] courses in Olympic history.<ref name=judd/>  Both men and women competed in the downhill, giant slalom and slalom with all 6 events held between 20 and 26 February.<ref name=sras>{{cite web|title=Alpine Skiing at the 1960 Squaw Valley Winter Games|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1960/ASK/|accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref>  The men's downhill was won by [[France at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Frenchman]] [[Jean Vuarnet]] who changed the sport by becoming the first Olympic champion to use metal skis.<ref name=judd/>  [[Switzerland at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Swiss]] skier [[Roger Staub]] won the giant slalom and [[Ernst Hinterseer]] from [[Austria at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Austria]] was the slalom champion.  German [[Heidi Biebl]] won the women's downhill, [[Yvonne R<U+00FC>egg]] of Switzerland won the giant slalom and [[Anne Heggtveit]] from Canada won the slalom.  Skiers from 6 different nations won medals and [[Penny Pitou]] of the United States was the only multiple medal winner when she earned two silvers in the downhill and giant slalom.  <ref name=sras/>

===Closing ceremonies===
The Games were brought to a close on 28 February, in Blyth Memorial arena in front of 20,000 people.  Flags of the participating nations were followed by the athletes marching as a group with no national distinctions.  The flag bearers made a semi-circle around the [[rostrum]] and the national anthems of Greece, United States, and Austria were played as their respective flags were raised.<ref>The Greek flag honored Greece as the originators of the Olympic Games, the United States flag represented the host nation and the Austrian flag was raised because [[Innsbruck]], Austria had been selected to host the 1964 Winter Games.</ref>  IOC president Avery Brundage declared the Games closed at which point the Olympic flame was extinguished.  The Games concluded with the release of several thousand balloons.<ref>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), pp.  59-60</ref>

==Calendar==

The opening ceremony was held on 18 February, along with the first games of the hockey tournament. From 19 to 28 February, the day of the closing ceremony, at least one event final was held each day.<ref>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), pp. 54-59</ref>

==Venues==
The lack of facilities prior to the Olympics gave organizers freedom to tailor the layout of the venues to fit the needs of the athletes.<ref name=or33>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 33</ref>  Their vision was for an intimate Games in which athletes and spectators could walk between venues.<ref name=Findling338/>  This was accomplished with the exception of the cross-country events, which were held at [[McKinney Creek Stadium|McKinney Creek]] a {{convert|12|mi|km|abbr=on}} drive from Squaw Valley.<ref name=Findling339/>  In prior Winter Olympics the athletes were housed in hotels and billetted with local families.  Since no such facilities existed in Squaw Valley the organizers decided to build the first Olympic Village at the Winter Games.  Competitors slept in one of four dormitories and ate together in a dining room.  The complex was located centrally with access to all the sporting facilities.<ref name=or33/>

The peaks surrounding Squaw Valley were used for the alpine skiing events.  The ladies' downhill and men's slalom and giant slalom were on KT-22 mountain, while the ladies' slalom and giant slalom were contested on Little Papoose Peak.  Squaw Peak was the site of the men's downhill competition.  Prior to the Games concerns persisted that the courses would not meet international standards.  To addresses these concerns a test event was held in 1959 and attending delegates from the [[International Ski Federation]] (FIS) left assured that the events would comply with FIS rules and specifications.  Bleachers were constructed for officials, coaches and spectators along with broadcast booths for radio and television.<ref>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 93</ref>  The ski jump hill was located on Little Papoose Peak directly opposite of Blyth Memorial Arena.  Designed by Heini Klopfer, the hill was innovative in that it had 40, 60, and 80&nbsp;meter jumps.  Tall trees on both sides protected athletes from the wind and it was situated so that the sun would be at the jumper's back during the competition.<ref>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 103</ref>

McKinney Creek Stadium was built to host all of the cross-country races, which included the biathlon and a portion of the nordic combined competition.  It consisted of a timing building, two [[quonset hut]]s for competitors and course workers, a scoreboard and bleachers to accommodate 1,200 people.  Shooting ranges were interspersed throughout the biathlon cross-country course and were supervised by [[non-commissioned officer]]s of the United States military.<ref>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), pp. 109-118</ref>

Blyth Memorial Arena was the centerpiece of the Games.  It was host to the opening and closing ceremonies, the figure skating competition, several speed skating events as well as most of the games in the hockey tournament.<ref>The alternate site for ice hockey and speed skating was the Squaw Valley Olympic skating rink, which was an outdoor venue with aritificial ice.</ref>  All three of the sports were held indoors on artificial ice for the first time in Olympic history.<ref name=or121>Squaw Valley Organizing Committee (1960), p. 121</ref>  At full capacity the arena accommodated 11,000 people, 8,500 of which were seated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Then and if|last=Brown|first=Matthew|work=Nevada Magazine|date=January/February 2010|url=http://www.nevadamagazine.com/issues/read/then_and_if/|accessdate=2011-08-17}}</ref>  One end of the stadium could be openned and closed depending on the event.  During the ceremonies it was open to allow for the entrance of the athletes, during the competitions it was closed to accommodate more spectators.  A special machine was created to resurface the ice for all three competitions.  It could lay a new ice surface on the 400-meter speed skating track in 45&nbsp;minutes.  In addition to resurfacing the ice the machine created the snow dividers that dileniated the racing lanes.<ref name=or121/>  The roof was designed on a suspension principle using cables rather than vertical supports, this removed any visual impediments for the audience but it weakened the strength of the roof.  Given the amount of annual snowfall this was a concern, but designers planned on using heat generated by the refrigeration plant to melt the snow.<ref name=ps138/><ref name=or121/>  There were flaws in the design and miscalculations in the load the roof could bear, during a particularly heavy snowfall in 1983 a portion of the roof collapsed and the building was demolished.<ref>{{cite web|title=Havey Snow Failures in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California|last1=Coen|first1=Charles|last2=Crane|first2=David|publisher=Western Snow Conference|format=pdf|pages=146-147|url=http://www.westernsnowconference.org/proceedings/pdf_Proceedings/1987%20WEB/CoenHeavySnowFailures.pdf|accessdate=2011-08-17}}</ref><ref name=srhockey/>
