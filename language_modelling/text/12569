The '''State Policy Network''' ('''SPN''') is a [[nonprofit]] [[corporation]] which functions primarily as an [[umbrella organization]] for a [[consortium]] of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] [[think tank]]s which focus on [[state policy (United States)|state-level policy]]. Founded in 1992, it is headquartered in [[Arlington, Virginia]], with member groups located in all fifty states.

==Overview==

SPN characterizes itself as the "professional service organization" for a network of state-level think tanks across the United States.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Matthew Medvetz|first1=Thomas|title=Think Tanks and Production of Policy-knowledge in America|date=2007|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|page=168|isbn= 978-0549529002 |accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Marley|first1=Patrick|last2=Stein|first2=Jason|title=More Than They Bargained For: Scott Walker, Unions, and the Fight for Wisconsin|date=2013|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0299293831|page=37|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Dagan|first1=David|last2=Teles|first2=Steven|title=The Conservative War on Prisons|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/novemberdecember_2012/features/the_conservative_war_on_prison041104.php?page=all|accessdate=2 January 2015|publisher=Washington Monthly|date=November<U+2013>December 2012}}</ref>

==History==
The State Policy Network was founded in 1992 by [[Thomas A. Roe]],<ref name=AboutSPN>[http://www.spn.org/about/default.asp About SPN], State Policy Network website, accessed February 17, 2015</ref> a [[South Carolina]] businessman who was a member of the board of trustees of the [[Heritage Foundation]].<ref name=MotherJones20110425>{{cite news |first=Andy |last=Kroll |url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/04/state-policy-network-union-bargaining |title=The Right-Wing Network Behind the War on Unions |publisher=''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' |date=April 25, 2011 |accessdate=February 16, 2015}}</ref><ref name="capitalresearch">{{cite web |authorlink=John J.

Reagan's reply was "Do something about it," which led Roe to establish the [[South Carolina Policy Council]] and later the State Policy Network.<ref name=miller/> The network was an outgrowth of the Madison Group, a collection of state-level think tanks in states including [[South Carolina]], [[Colorado]], [[Illinois]], and [[Michigan]] that had been meeting periodically at the [[Loews Madison Hotel|Madison Hotel]] in [[Washington, DC]].<ref name=SPNhistory>[http://www.spn.org/about/page/history SPN History] accessed February 17, 2015</ref> [[Gary Palmer (politician)|Gary Palmer]], co-founder and president of the nonprofit conservative think tank the [[Alabama Policy Institute]] from 1989 until stepping down in 2014 to run successfully for US Congress, helped found the State Policy Network and served as its president.<ref name=palmer>{{cite news|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/conservative-candidate-character-conviction-knowledge-and-leadership_793445.html|title=A Conservative Candidate of Character, Conviction, Knowledge, and Leadership |magazine=[[The Weekly Standard]]|date=May 22, 2014|first=Fred|last=Barnes |accessdate=March 23, 2015}}</ref>

Initially, the network consisted of fewer than 20 member organizations. By 2014, there were 65, and at least one in each state.<ref name=palmer/> [[Lawrence W. Reed]], the first president of the [[Mackinac Center for Public Policy]], a [[Michigan]] [[free market]] [[think tank]], fostered new state-level regular member organizations through delivery of his think tank training course.<ref name=NYTguru/>

In December, 2013, ''[[The Guardian]]'', the British national daily newspaper, in collaboration with the ''[[Texas Observer]]'' in [[Austin]] and the ''[[Portland Press Herald]]'' in [[Maine]], obtained, published and analyzed 40 grant proposals from SPN regular member organizations.  The  grants proposals sought funding through SPN from the [[Daniel_C._Searle#Philanthropy|Searle Freedom Trust]]. According to ''The Guardian'', the proposals documented a co-ordinated strategy across 34 states, "a blueprint for the conservative agenda in 2014." The reports described the grants proposals as proposing campaigns designed to cut pay to state government employees, against worker and union rights, reduce public sector services in [[education policy|education]], [[healthcare policy|healthcare]], and [[workers' compensation]], promote [[school voucher]]s, thwart efforts to combat [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, eliminate [[income tax in the United States|income]] and [[sales tax in the United States|sales taxes]], and to study a proposed [[block grant]] reform to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].<ref name=Guardian12052013>{{cite news |last1=Pilkington |first1=Ed |last2=Goldenberg |first2=Suzanne |title=State conservative groups plan US-wide assault on education, health and tax |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=[[London]] |date=December 5, 2013 |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/05/state-conservative-groups-assault-education-health-tax |accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref><ref name=upi/><ref>{{cite news |date=December 5, 2013 |title=Washington County residents have mixed reactions to plan to eliminate taxes |first=Colin |last=Woodard |accessdate=February 22, 2015 |url=http://www.pressherald.com/2013/12/05/mainers-in-washington-county-have-mixed-reactions-to-freeme-plan-to-eliminate-taxes/ |newspaper=[[Portland Press Herald]] |location=[[Portland, Maine]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The Money Behind the Fight to Undermine Medicaid |first=Forrest |last=Wilder |date=December 5, 2013 |accessdate=February 22, 2015 |url=http://www.texasobserver.org/money-behind-fight-undermine-medicaid/ |newspaper=[[Texas Observer]] |location=[[Austin, Texas]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Conservative Think Tank Network Plotting "Coordinated Assault" on Medicaid, Education, Workers' Rights |first=Andy |last=Kroll |date=December 5, 2013 |accessdate=April 2, 2015 |magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |url=http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/12/state-policy-network-assault-worker-rights-medicaid}}</ref>

==Policy positions==
Policy initiatives supported by SPN members have included reductions in state health and [[welfare]] programs, [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutional]] amendments to limit state government spending, expanded access to [[charter school]]s, and [[school voucher]]s.<ref name=NYTguru/> Another area of activism has been opposition to [[public-sector union]]s.<ref name=MotherJones20110425/> Tracie Sharp, SPN's president, has said the organization focuses on issues such as "workplace freedom, education reform, and individual choice in healthcare."<ref name=Guardian12052013/>

The [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] magazine ''Mother Jones'' stated that in 2011 SPN and its member organizations were backing a "war on organized labor" by Republican state lawmakers.<ref name=MotherJones20110425/> Legislative actions taken by the GOP included the introduction and enactment of bills reducing or eliminating [[collective bargaining]] for teachers and other government workers and reducing the authority of unions to collect dues from government employees.<ref name=MotherJones20110425/> In [[Iowa]], Governor [[Terry Branstad]] cited research by SPN's Public Interest Institute when asking to amend laws to limit collective bargaining by public employees.<ref name=MotherJones20110425/>

==Political influence==

SPN and its member groups have supported a variety of conservative legislation in the states.<ref name=MotherJones20110425/>

In 1990, the [[Mackinac Center for Public Policy]] shared much of its "brain trust" with Republican governor [[John Engler]]'s election campaign. After the election the Mackinac Center worked successfully with the Engler administration to effect policy changes in areas such as the promotion of [[charter school]]s and increasing competition in state contracting.<ref name=miller/>

In 2006, three former presidents of SPN regular member organizations were in the [[United States House of Representatives]]: [[Mike Pence]] of [[Indiana]], [[Jeff Flake]] of [[Arizona]], and [[Tom Tancredo]] of [[Colorado]] and all were [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].<ref name=NYTguru>Jason Deparle, [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/17/us/politics/17thinktank.html Right-of-Center Guru Goes Wide With the Gospel of Small Government], ''[[New York Times]]'', November 17, 2006</ref> ''National Review'' described them as having "used SPN organizations as political springboards."<ref name=miller>{{cite news |first=John J. |last=Miller |title=Fifty flowers bloom: Conservative think tanks<U+2014>mini-Heritage Foundations<U+2014>at the state level |publisher=[[National Review]] |date=November 19, 2007 |volume=59 |issue=21 |pages=42<U+2013>44 |authorlink=John J. Miller}}</ref>

==Finances==

SPN files with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) as a [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization]].  Its independently audited 2013 [[Form 990]] shows $8.0 million in revenues and $8.4 million in expenditures, of which $1.3 million was used for [[Grant (money)|grants]] and payments to other organizations.<ref name=CNavigator>[http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=11196#.VOKqGVPF8me State Policy Network], Charity Navigator website, accessed February 17, 2015</ref><ref name=SPNIRS9902013>{{cite web |url=http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990_pdf_archive/570/570952531/570952531_201312_990.pdf?_ga=1.8376945.219813843.1424132108 |title=2013 Form 990 State Policy Network |accessdate=2015-02-17 }}</ref> The network received a [[Charity Navigator]] score of 89 out of 100 possible points for "accountability and transparency" in its most recent (December 2012) evaluation.<ref name=CNavigator />
