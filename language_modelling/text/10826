'''Hell-Bourg''' is a small village in the [[Salazie]] [[commune of France|commune (administrative division)]] of the [[overseas department|French overseas department]] of  [[R<U+00E9>union]]. It is the main community in the island's [[Cirque de Salazie]], and is named for the respected former admiral and island governor [[Anne Chr<U+00E9>tien Louis de Hell]]. Previously the village had been named ''B<U+00E9>maho''.<ref>[http://www.clicanoo.com/article.php3?id_article=97608 Anne Chr<U+00E9>tien Louis de Hell] (in [[French language|French]], due to the scarcity of detailed English sources)</ref> It is located at 1344 m (4412 ft) above sea level.<ref>[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RE/0/HellBourg.html Hell-Bourg, Reunion Page] (from the [[Global Gazetteer|Global Gazetteer Version 2.1]] private website)</ref>

==History==

===Spa town===

Originally B<U+00E9>maho/Hell-Bourg was founded as a small, but prosperous, [[spa town]] and prospered as such for most of a century after the 1830 discovery of a [[hot spring]] near the future village. A [[military hospital]] associated with the spring was also finished in 1857 and a road open for carriages finally reached the village in 1890.<ref name="TIME"/> 

The spring had been discovered in the bed of the brook ''Bras Sec'' ('Dry arm'), a tributary of the ''[[Rivi<U+00E8>re du Mat]]''. It had a flow of around 800-1,300 liters per hour, and a water temperature of 32[[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]], and its waters were [[iron]]-bearing, only midly [[chlorinated]] and [[Calcite|calcic]] and contained no [[sulfate|sulphates]]. They were soon being recommended for children, weak and [[Anemia|anaemic]] adults, as well as people suffering from [[gastritis]]. In 1852, the ''[[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Anonyme]] de l'Etablissement Thermal de Salazie'' was founded, which built the [[Mineral spa|spa]], a [[casino]] and a director's house. Many [[creole]]-style [[villa]]s of rich individuals followed.<ref name="FTW">[http://www.fotw.net/flags/re-salaz.html Presentation of Salazie] (from the [[Flags of the World]] website, with further references)</ref> 

The thermal baths were soon famous even beyond R<U+00E9>union - together with other spas at [[Cilaos]], in the island's south, and [[Antsirabe]] at Madagascar, they became a goal of travellers from as far as South Africa, Kenya or Mozambique, as well as a vacation spot for rich [[vanilla]] [[plantation]] owners from the island's east.<ref name="OFF">[http://www.la-reunion-tourisme.com/ville.php?v=4,,24 Salazie - Hell-Bourg] (from the official [[R<U+00E9>union]] tourism website, note: [[English language|English]] website version technically unreliable)</ref>

===Decline===

Later, the springs were purchased by the municipality of Salazie, which in turn ceded them to the Colonial administration. However, in 1920 the water temperature dropped and boiling was required to heat it to the accustomated state which in turn destroyed some of the chemical elements. The spa started to lose its attraction. An attempt to clear the springs with [[dynamite]] failed disastrously and caused a partial collapse of the spa and the destruction of the casino.<ref name="FTW"/> 

The spring was finally fully blocked by a [[cyclone]]-related landslide in 1948 (as were, temporarily, the roads leading to Hell-Bourg) and the village quickly lost the importance which had originally caused it to flourish in the difficult mountaineous region.<ref name="TIME">[http://www.ville-salazie.fr/v3/historique.html Les dates cl<U+00E9>s] (from the official [[Salazie]] website, in [[French language|French]], due to the scarcity of detailed English sources)</ref><ref name="FTW"/>

===Modern days===

After some decades of being mostly forgotten and occupied mainly by poorer farmers, tourism has since given it a modest income. As the only village on the island it is a member of [[Les Plus Beaux Villages de France]] ('The most beautiful villages in France'), an award given to about 150 of the most striking small communities in France. In connection with the requirements for the award, there are few to no visible modern elements like telephone or power poles in the village.<ref name="OFF"/>

The village, with its several small and midsized hotels, which include a small [[youth hostel]],<ref>[http://www.auberge-jeunesse-reunion.com/english.html Hell-Bourg - Salazie] (from the official R<U+00E9>union youth hostel website)</ref> is a base for [[hiking]] within the Cirque, especially to the small peak in the caldera center, the [[Piton d'Anchaing]] (4-6 hours return) or up to the island's central peak, the [[Piton des Neiges]] (2 days return). It is also home to a small [[museum]], several [[nineteenth century]] [[Creole peoples|Creole]] buildings, and a famously colorful local cemetery. The area is also is known for growing [[chou chou]].
