'''''Dampiera purpurea''''', commonly known as the '''mountain-''' or '''purple dampiera''', is a subshrub in the family [[Goodeniaceae]] native to Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland in eastern Australia. Its blue-purple flowers appear in spring and early summer (September to December), and it is pollinated by insects such as butterflies and bees. Adapting readily to cultivation, ''Dampiera purpurea'' is grown as a garden plant in Australia.

==Taxonomy==
The prolific botanist [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] described ''Dampiera purpurea'' in his 1810 work ''[[Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen]]''.<ref name=APNI/> Its species name is the [[Latin]] adjective ''purpureus'' "purple".<ref name=EJ84>{{cite book |author=Elliot Rodger W.; Jones, David L.; Blake, Trevor |title=Encyclopaedia of Australian Plants Suitable for Cultivation:Volume 3 - Ce-Er|year=1984|pages=470<U+2013>72|publisher=Lothian Press |location=Port Melbourne |isbn=0-85091-167-2}}</ref>

==Description==
''Dampiera purpurea'' is an erect multi-stemmed plant to 1 m (4 ft) high with obovate to elliptic leaves which are 0.9 to 6 cm (0.4-2.4 in) long and 0.5 to 4.2 cm (0.2-1.7 in) wide. The stems and undersides of leaves are covered in fine hair and rough in texture, while the leaves are bare of hair when mature. The flowers are mainly produced between August and January in the species native range. Three to five flowers arise each on groups of two to nine flower-bearing branches.<ref name=NSW>{{cite web |url=http://plantnet.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/NSWfl.pl?page=nswfl&lvl=sp&name=Dampiera~purpurea |title=''Dampiera purpurea'' |accessdate=2009-09-27 |author=|work= PlantNET - New South Wales Flora Online |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens & Domain Trust, Sydney Australia}}</ref> Reaching 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter, they are generally blue-purple in colour with yellow centres,<ref name=EJ84/> though pink and white flowers have been recorded.<ref name=Ben97>{{cite journal |last=Benson |first=Doug |coauthors=McDougall, Lyn |year=1997|title=Ecology of Sydney plant species:Part 5: Dicotyledon families Flacourtiaceae to Myrsinaceae|journal=Cunninghamia |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages= 330-544 |url=http://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/73332/Cun5Ben330.pdf}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
''Dampiera purpurea'' occurs in sclerophyll forest and heath in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]].<ref name=NSW/> In the Sydney region, it is found under such trees as smooth-barked apple (''[[Angophora costata]]''), yellow bloodwood (''[[Corymbia eximia]]''), red bloodwood (''[[Corymbia gummifera|C. gummifera]]''), blackbutt (''[[Eucalyptus pilularis]]''), monkey gum (''[[Eucalyptus cypellocarpa|E. cypellocarpa]]''), silvertop ash (''[[Eucalyptus sieberi|E. sieberi]]''), Sydney peppermint (''[[Eucalyptus piperita|E. piperita]]''), predominantly on sandstone-based soils but sometimes also clay soils, and generally in places with good drainage. the annual rainfall is 800 to 1600 mm.<ref name=Ben97/>

==Ecology==
''Dampiera purpurea'' is killed by bushfire, with new shoots arising from ground level. These can then flower in ten months, peaking around two to three years after a fire. It also regenerates by seed from fire.<ref name=Ben97/>

Butterflies of the families [[Lycaenidae]] and [[Hesperiidae]] and european honeybees forage at the flowers, and are likely pollinators.<ref name=Ben97/>

==Cultivation==
''Dampiera purpurea'' can be grown in cool to subtropical climates. It is a variable species, reflected by the many forms in cultivation.  Preferring a lightly shaded position, it also adapts to full sun and has some frost tolerance.
It is adaptable to most reasonably drained soils and will withstand dry periods once established, though best results are obtained though a steady supply of moisture in spring and summer.<ref name=Seale/> It can be more vigorous in heavier soils.<ref name=EJ84/> A light pruning after flowering keeps plants in shape.<ref name=Seale>{{cite book|author=Seale, Allan| title=Garden Companion to Australian Native Plants|publisher=Reed Books|location=Australia | year=1988 |page=90 | isbn=0730101878}}</ref><ref name=Greig>{{cite book|author=Greig, Denise| title=The Australian Gardener's Wildflower Catalogue| publisher=Angus & Robertson|location= Australia | year=1987 |page=132| isbn=0207154600}}</ref> Plants can be propagated by cuttings or division.<ref name=Wrigley>{{cite book|author=Wrigley John W.; Fagg, Murray|year=1979|title=Australian Native Plants|page=106|publisher=William Collins Publishers Sydney, Australia|isbn= 0-00-216416-7}}</ref>
