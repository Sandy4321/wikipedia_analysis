[[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] '''Douglas MacArthur''' (January 26, 1880 &ndash; April 5, 1964) was an [[United States|American]] [[General officer|general]] and [[Field Marshal (Philippines)|Field Marshal]] of the [[Philippine Army]]. He was a [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] during the 1930s and played a prominent role in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]] during [[World War II]]. He was a highly decorated soldier of the war, receiving the [[Medal of Honor]] for his early service in the [[Battle of the Philippines (1941<U+2013>1942)|Philippines]]. [[Arthur MacArthur, Jr.]] and Douglas MacArthur were the first father and son to each be awarded the medal. He was one of only five men ever to rise to the [[Military rank|rank]] of General of the Army and the only one to become a field marshal in the Philippine Army. 

The son of Arthur MacArthur, Jr., an Army officer who was awarded the Medal of Honor for the [[American Civil War]], Douglas MacArthur was raised as a [[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|military brat]] in the [[American Old West]]. He  attended the [[T.M.I.: The Episcopal School of Texas|West Texas Military Academy]], where he was [[valedictorian]], and the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, where he was First Captain and graduated top of the class of 1903. During the [[U.S. occupation of Veracruz]] he conducted a daring reconnaissance mission for which he was nominated for the Medal of Honor. In 1917 he was promoted from [[Major (United States)|major]] to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] and became chief of staff of the [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd ("Rainbow") Division]]. In the fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during [[World War I]] he rose to the rank of [[Brigadier General (United States)|brigadier general]], was again nominated for the Medal of Honor, awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] twice and the [[Silver Star]] seven times for gallantry.

After the war, he was appointed [[Superintendents of the United States Military Academy|Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point]], where he attempted to carry through a series of reforms. Posted to the [[Philippines]], he dealt with a [[mutiny]] that had broken out amongst the [[Philippine Scouts]]. In 1925 he became the Army's youngest major general. He served on the [[court martial]] of Brigadier General [[Billy Mitchell]] and was president of the [[United States Olympic Committee]] during the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in [[Amsterdam]]. In 1930 he became [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]]. As such, he was involved with the expulsion of the [[Bonus Army]] protesters fro [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1932, and the establishment and organization of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. He retired from the U.S. Army in 1937 to become [[Office of the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines|Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines]].

MacArthur was recalled to active duty in 1941 as commander of [[U.S. Army Forces in the Far East]]. A series of disasters followed, starting with the destruction of his air force December 8, 1941 and the invasion of the Philippines by the Japanese. MacArthur's forces were soon compelled to withdraw to [[Bataan]], where they held out until May 1942. In March 1942, MacArthur, his family and his staff left [[Corregidor]] in four [[PT boat]]s, and escaped to [[Australia]], where MacArthur became Supreme Commander, [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]]. For his defense of the Philippines, MacArthur was awarded the Medal of Honor. After more than two years of fighting he fulfilled a promise to return to the Philippines. He officially accepted Japan's surrender on September 2, 1945, and oversaw the [[occupation of Japan]] from 1945 to 1951. He led the [[United Nations Command (Korea)|United Nations Command]] in the [[Korean War]] from 1950 to 1951. On April 11, 1951, MacArthur was removed from command by President [[Harry S. Truman]] for disagreeing with Truman's policy on the Korean War.

==Education and early life==
Douglas MacArthur was born January 26, 1880 at the [[Tower Building of the Little Rock Arsenal|Arsenal Barracks]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], where his parents were stationed at the time. He was the youngest of three sons, the others being [[Arthur MacArthur III]], born on August 1, 1876, and Malcolm on October 17, 1878.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=23.}}</ref> Malcolm died of [[measles]] in 1883.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=25.}}</ref> His parents were [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Arthur MacArthur, Jr.]], at the time a U.S. Army [[captain (U.S. Army)|captain]], a recipient of the [[Medal of Honor]] for the [[American Civil War]], and Mary Pinkney Hardy MacArthur (nicknamed "Pinky") of [[Norfolk, Virginia]].<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|pp=13<U+2013>14.}}</ref> Douglas MacArthur was the grandson of jurist and politician [[Arthur MacArthur, Sr.]], a Scottish immigrant.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|pp=4<U+2013>5.}}</ref> Douglas was raised as a [[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|military brat]] on a succession of Army posts in the [[American Old West]]. In his memoir, ''Reminiscences'', MacArthur wrote that "I learned to ride and shoot even before I could read or write&mdash;indeed, almost before I could walk and talk."<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=15.}}</ref>

[[File:View copy.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Douglas MacArthur as a student at [[TMI <U+2014> The Episcopal School of Texas| West Texas Military Academy]] in the 1890s]]
This time on the frontier ended in July 1889 when the MacArthur family moved to [[Washington, DC]],<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=56.}}</ref> where Douglas attended the Force Public School on Massachusetts Avenue. His father was posted to [[San Antonio, Texas]] in September 1893. While there Douglas attended the [[T.M.I.: The Episcopal School of Texas|West Texas Military Academy]],<ref name="MacArthur, pp. 16-18"/> where he was an excellent student, winning the gold medal for the "highest standing in scholarship and deportment." He was also the school tennis champion, played quarterback on the undefeated school [[American football|football]] team, and shortstop on its baseball team. He was also [[valedictorian]], with a final year average of 97.33.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=60<U+2013>61.}}</ref> In May 1896, his father was promoted to [[lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] and in January he was reassigned to the [[Department of Dakota]] at [[St Paul, Minnesota]] and the family moved to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].<ref name="MacArthur, pp. 16-18">{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|pp=16<U+2013>18.}}</ref> MacArthur's father and grandfather unsuccessfully sought to secure Douglas a presidential appointment to the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, first from President [[Grover Cleveland]] and then from President [[William McKinley]].<ref name="James, pp. 62<U+2013>66">{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=62<U+2013>66.}}</ref> After these two rejections,<ref name="macvoa">{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/specialenglish/archive/2005-07/2005-07-24-voa2.cfm|title=Douglas MacArthur: Born to Be a Soldier|last=Thompson|first=Paul|date=July 24, 2005|publisher=Voice of America|accessdate=April 11, 2009}}</ref> he passed a competitive examination for a congressional appointment from Congressman [[Theobald Otjen]],<ref name="MacArthur, pp. 16-18"/> scoring 93.3 on the test, sixteen points higher than his nearest competitor.<ref name="James, pp. 62<U+2013>66"/> He later wrote: "It was a lesson I never forgot. Preparedness is the key to success and victory."<ref name="MacArthur, pp. 16-18"/>

MacArthur entered West Point on June 13, 1899<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=25.}}</ref> and his mother also moved there to a suite at Craney's Hotel, overlooking the grounds of the Academy.<ref name=SIWestPoint>{{cite web |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/westpoint/history_6a1_pop2.html |title=Douglas MacArthur and his mother |accessdate=December 12, 2007 |publisher= [[Smithsonian Institution]]}}</ref> [[Hazing]] was widespread at West Point at this time, and MacArthur and his classmate [[Ulysses S. Grant III]] were singled out for special attention by southern cadets as sons of generals with mothers living at Craney's. Cadet Oscar Booz left West Point after being savagely hazed and subsequently died of [[tuberculosis]]. Booz's parents attacked West Point policies and brought about a congressional inquiry in 1901. MacArthur was called to appear before a special Congressional committee where he was questioned about cadets implicated in hazing.  MacArthur downplayed his own hazing even though the other cadet that also testified gave the full story of MacArthur's hazing to the committee. In 1901, Congress outlawed acts "of a harassing, tyrannical, abusive, shameful, insulting or humiliating nature."<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=69<U+2013>71.}}</ref> MacArthur was a [[corporal]] in Company B in his second year, a [[first sergeant]] in Company A in his third year and First Captain, the highest ranking senior cadet, in his final year.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=79.}}</ref> He played left field for the baseball team and academically, he was an outstanding cadet, earning 2424.12 merits out of a possible 2470.00 or 98.14. He graduated first in his 93-man class.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=77.}}</ref> On graduation June 11, 1903 MacArthur was commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], it being the custom at that time for the top ranking cadets to be commissioned into the engineers.<ref>{{harvnb|Manchester|1978|pp=60<U+2013>61.}}</ref>

==Junior officer==
MacArthur spent his graduation furlough with his parents at [[Fort Mason]], where his father, now a [[Major General (United States)|major general]], was serving as commander of the [[Division of the Pacific]]. Afterward, he joined the 3rd Engineer Battalion, which departed for the [[Philippines]] in October 1903. MacArthur was sent to [[Iloilo]], where he supervised the construction of a wharf at [[Camp Jossman]]. He went on to conduct surveys at [[Tacloban City]], [[Calbayog City]] and [[Cebu City]]. In November 1903, while working on [[Guimaras]], he was ambushed by a pair of Filipino brigands or guerrillas, and shot and killed both with his pistol.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=87<U+2013>89.}}</ref> He passed his examinations for promotion to [[first lieutenant]] in [[Manila]] in March 1904 and was promoted to the rank in April.<ref>{{harvnb|Manchester|1978|p=65.}}</ref> In October 1904 his tour of duty was cut short when he contracted [[malaria]] and [[dhobi itch]] during a survey on [[Bataan]]. He returned to San Francisco, where he was assigned to the [[California Debris Commission]]. In July 1905 he became chief engineer of the Division of the Pacific.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=90<U+2013>91.}}</ref>   

In October 1905 MacArthur received orders to proceed to [[Tokyo, Japan]] for appointment as [[aide-de-camp]] to his father. They inspected Japanese military bases at [[Nagasaki]], [[Kobe]] and [[Kyoto]], then headed to [[India]] via [[Shanghai]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Java]] and [[Singapore]], reaching [[Calcutta]] in January 1906. In India they visited [[Madras]], [[Tuticorin]], [[Quetta]], [[Karachi]], the [[Northwest Frontier]] and the [[Khyber Pass]]. They then sailed to [[China]] via [[Bangkok]] and [[Saigon]], and toured [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[Tsingtao]], [[Peking]], [[Tientsin]], [[Hankow]] and Shanghai before returning to Japan in June. The next month they returned to the United States,<ref>{{harvnb|Manchester|1978|pp=66<U+2013>67.}}</ref> where Arthur MacArthur resumed his duties at Fort Mason, with Douglas still his aide. In September, Douglas received orders to report to the 2nd Engineer Battalion at the [[Washington Barracks]] and enroll in the Engineer School. This was normally the next rung on the ladder for engineer officers, and MacArthur was selected a year earlier than other members of his West Point class. While there he also served at "an aide to assist at [[White House]] functions" at the request of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]].<ref name="James, pp. 95<U+2013>97"/> 

In August 1907 MacArthur was sent to the engineer district office in Milwaukee, where his parents were now living. In April 1908 he was posted to [[Fort Leavenworth]], where he was given his first command, Company K, 3rd Engineer Battalion. 
<ref name="James, pp. 95<U+2013>97">{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=95<U+2013>97.}}</ref> He became battalion [[adjutant]] in 1909 and then engineer officer at Fort Leavenworth in 1910. MacArthur was promoted to [[Captain (United States)|captain]] in February 1911 and was appointed as head of the Military Engineering Department and the Field Engineer School. He participated in exercises at [[San Antonio, Texas]] with the [[Maneuver Division (United States)|Maneuver Division]] in 1911 and served in [[Panama]] on detached duty in January and February 1912. The sudden death of their father on September 5, 1912 brought Douglas and his brother Arthur back to Milwaukee to care for their mother, whose health had deteriorated. MacArthur requested a transfer to Washington, DC so his mother could be near [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. Army Chief of Staff, Major General [[Leonard Wood]], an old friend of the family, took up the matter with [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry L. Stimson]], who arranged for MacArthur to be posted to the Office of the Chief of Staff in 1912.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=105<U+2013>109.}}</ref>

==Veracruz Expedition==
On April 21, 1914, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] was alerted to a [[German Empire|German]] shipment of weapons for [[Victoriano Huerta]] and ordered the [[U.S. occupation of Veracruz]]. Secretary of War [[Lindley Miller Garrison]] designated Wood to command an expedition to [[Mexico City]] in the event that war broke out between the United States and [[Mexico]]. Wood handed over the job of Chief of Staff to Major General [[William Wallace Wotherspoon]], and selected a headquarters staff that included MacArthur, who was sent to reconnoiter the Veracruz area. MacArthur arrived at Veracruz on the [[battleship]] {{USS|Nebraska|BB-14|6}} on May 1, 1914.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=115<U+2013>117}}</ref>  

MacArthur realized that the logistic support of an advance from Veracruz would require the use of the railroad. Finding plenty of [[railroad car]]s in Veracruz but no [[locomotive]]s, MacArthur set out to verify a report that there were a number of locomotives in [[Alvarado, Veracruz]]. For $150 in [[gold]], he acquired a [[handcar]] and the services of three Mexicans, whom he disarmed. MacArthur and his party of three Mexicans, successfully located five engines in Alvarado, two of which were only [[switcher]]s, but the other three locomotives were exactly what was required. On the way back to Veracruz, MacArthur and his party were set upon by five armed men. The party made a run for it and outdistanced all but two of the armed men, whom MacArthur shot. Soon after the party were attacked by a group of about fifteen horsemen. MacArthur took three bullet holes in his clothes but was unharmed. One of his Mexican companions was lightly wounded before the horsemen finally decided to retire after MacArthur shot four of them. Further on, the party were attacked a third time by three mounted men. MacArthur received another bullet hole in his shirt, but the party, using their handcart, managed to outrun all but one of the mounted men. MacArthur shot both the mounted man and his horse, and the party had to remove the horse's carcass from the track before proceeding.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|pp=40<U+2013>42}}</ref> 

A fellow officer, Captain Constant Cordier of the [[4th Infantry Regiment (United States)|4th Infantry]], wrote to Wood recommending that MacArthur's name be put forward for the [[Medal of Honor]]. Wood duly did so, and Chief of Staff [[Hugh L. Scott]] convened a board to consider the award.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=121<U+2013>125}}</ref> The board questioned "the advisability of this enterprise having been undertaken without the knowledge of the commanding general on the ground..."<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=125}}</ref> This was [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Frederick Funston]], a Medal of Honor winner himself, who considered that awarding the medal to MacArthur would be "entirely appropriate and justifiable."<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=124}}</ref> However the board feared that "to bestow the award recommended might encourage any other staff officer, under similar conditions, to ignore the local commander, possibly interfering with the latter's plans..."; consequently, MacArthur received no award at all.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=125<U+2013>127}}</ref>

==World War I==

===Rainbow Division===
MacArthur returned to the War Department, where he was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] on December 11, 1915. In 1916 Scott appointed him to a committee to study [[motor transport]]. This was a new field at the time, and the job involved working closely with the [[U.S. Navy]], the [[American Automobile Association]], the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], and the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]].<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=129<U+2013>130}}</ref> In March 1916, a dispute between President Wilson and Secretary Garrison over the issue of preparedness for war led to the latter's resignation and replacement by [[Newton D. Baker]], who had MacArthur assigned to his office as a military assistant in charge of the new Bureau of Information in June.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|pp=43<U+2013>44}}</ref> MacArthur has since been regarded as the Army's first [[press officer]]. He prepared press releases related to the [[Pancho Villa Expedition]], the [[National Defense Act of 1916]] and the [[Selective Service Act of 1917]].<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=130<U+2013>131}}</ref> Following the declaration of war on [[German Empire|Germany]] on April 6, 1917, Baker and MacArthur put the case before President Wilson for the use of the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], and secured his agreement. To give effect to the decision, MacArthur suggested sending first a division organized from units of different states, so as to avoid the appearance of favoritism towards any particular state. Baker approved the creation of this formation, which became the [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd ("Rainbow") Division]], the head of the [[National Guard Bureau]], Major General William A. Mann as its commander and MacArthur as its chief of staff, with the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. At MacArthur's request, this commission was in the [[infantry]] rather than the engineers.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|pp=44<U+2013>46}}</ref>

The 42nd Division was assembled in August and September 1917 at [[Camp Mills]], New York, where its training emphasized open rather than [[trench warfare]]. It sailed in a [[convoy]] from [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] for France on October 18, 1917, with MacArthur making the passage on the [[Troopship|transport]] {{USS|Covington|ID-1409|6}}. The convoy's escort included the [[cruiser]] {{USS|Chattanooga|CL-18|6}}, commanded by his brother Arthur. On arrival MacArthur discovered that General Headquarters (GHQ) [[American Expeditionary Force]] (AEF) was considering breaking up the division for replacements. MacArthur approached Brigadier General [[James Harbord]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[John J. Pershing]]'s chief of staff, about the matter and managed to get the decision reversed.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|pp=51<U+2013>53}}</ref> However, on December 19, Mann was replaced as division commander by Major General [[Charles T. Menoher]].<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=148}}</ref> The division trained through the winter. MacArthur removed the metal band inside his cap, giving it a jaunty appearance, carried a [[Crop (implement)|riding crop]] and wore a bright [[turtleneck sweater]], earning him the accolade of the "[[Beau Brummell]] of the AEF."<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=156}}</ref>

===Second Battle of the Marne===
The 42nd Division entered the line in the quiet [[Lun<U+00E9>ville]] sector in February 1918. On February 26, MacArthur and Captain [[Thomas T. Handy]] accompanied a French [[Trench raiding|trench raid]] in which MacArthur assisted in the capture of a number of German prisoners. The commander of the [[:fr:7e corps d' arm<U+00E9>e (France)|French VII Corps]], Major General [[:fr:Georges de Bazelaire|Georges de Bazelaire]], decorated MacArthur with the [[Croix de guerre 1914<U+2013>1918 (France)|Croix de guerre]], the first such award to a member of the AEF. Menoher recommended MacArthur for the [[Silver Star]], which he later received.<ref name="James, p. 157">{{harvnb|James|1970|p=157}}</ref> On March 9, the 42nd Division launched three raids of its own on German trenches in the Salient du Feys. MacArthur accompanied a company of the [[168th Infantry Regiment (United States)|168th Infantry]]. This time, his "coolness and courageous leadership".<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=159}}</ref> was rewarded with the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]]. A few days later, MacArthur, who was strict about his men carrying their [[gas mask]] but often neglected to bring his own, was gassed. He was awarded the [[Purple Heart]] but recovered in time to show Secretary Baker around the area on March 19.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=159<U+2013>160}}</ref> Menoher told [[war correspondent]]s that "Colonel MacArthur is one of the ablest officers in the United States Army and also one of the most popular."<ref name="James, p. 157"/>          

MacArthur was promoted brigadier general on June 26, 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Manchester|1978|p=92}}</ref> At the time of his promotion, he was the youngest general in the AEF, although this record would not stand for long.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=172}}</ref> In late June the 42nd Division was shifted to [[Ch<U+00E2>lons-en-Champagne]] to oppose the impending German [[Second Battle of the Marne|Champagne-Marne Offensive]]. ''[[G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral d'Arm<U+00E9>e]]'' [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|Henri Gouraud]] of the [[Fourth Army (France)|French Fourth Army]] elected to meet the attack with a [[defense in depth]], holding the front line area as thinly as possible and meeting the German attack on his second line of defense. His plan succeeded, and MacArthur was awarded a second Silver Star.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|pp=57<U+2013>58}}</ref> The 42nd Division participated in the subsequent Allied counter-offensive, and MacArthur was awarded a third Silver Star for bravery under fire on July 29. Two days later, Menoher relieved Brigadier General Robert A. Brown of the 84th Infantry Brigade of his command and replaced him with MacArthur. Hearing reports that the enemy had withdrawn, MacArthur, who had not slept for four nights, went forward on August 2 to see for himself.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=187}}</ref> He later wrote: {{quote|It was 3:30 that morning when I started from our right at Sergy. Taking runners from each outpost liaison group to the next, moving by way of what had been No Man's Land, I will never forget that trip. The dead were so thick in spots we tumbled over them. There must have been at least 2,000 of those sprawled bodies. I identified the insignia of six of the best German divisions. The stench was suffocating. Not a tree was standing. The moans and cries of wounded men sounded everywhere. Sniper bullets sung like the buzzing of a hive of angry bees. An occasional shellburst always drew an angry oath from my guide. I counted almost a hundred disabled guns various size and several times that number of abandoned machine guns.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=60}}</ref>}}

===Meuse-Argonne Offensive===
MacArthur reported back to Menoher and Lieutenant General [[Hunter Liggett]] that the Germans had indeed withdrawn, and was awarded a fourth Silver Star.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=61}}</ref> He was also awarded a second Croix de guerre and made a ''commandant'' of the ''[[L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=193}}</ref> The 42nd Division earned a few weeks rest,<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=196<U+2013>197}}</ref> returning to the line for the [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel]] on September 12. The Allied advance proceeded rapidly and successfully, and MacArthur was awarded a fifth Silver Star for his leadership of the 84th Infantry Brigade.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=203<U+2013>204}}</ref> A sixth Silver Star was awarded for his participation in a raid on the night of September 25<U+2013>26.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=213}}</ref> The 42nd Division was relieved on the night of 30 September, moving to the [[Forest of Argonne|Argonne]] sector where it relieved the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Division]] there on the night of October 11. On a reconnaissance the next day, MacArthur was gassed again, earning a second Purple Heart. What he saw greatly disturbed him.

The 42nd Division's  participation in the [[Battle of the Argonne Forest]] began on October 14 when it attacked with both brigades. Progress was slow. That evening, asked for his intentions, MacArthur told Menoher that he intended to attack using [[bayonet]]s. A conference was called to discuss the attack, during which Summerall rang and demanded that Ch<U+00E2>ttillon be taken by 1800 the next evening. MacArthur gave him the same reply as before, which seemed to satisfy him. The group was unaware that Summerall had just relieved the commander of the 83rd Infantry Brigade.  An aerial photograph had been obtained that showed a gap in the German [[barbed wire]] to the northeast of Ch<U+00E2>ttillon. Lieutenant Colonel  Walter E. Bare, the commander of the [[167th Infantry Regiment (United States)|167th Infantry]], proposed an attack from that direction, where the defenses seemed least imposing, covered by a [[machine gun]] [[Barrage (artillery)|barrage]]. MacArthur adopted this plan.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferrell|2008|pp=47<U+2013>50}}</ref> MacArthur was wounded, but not severely, while verifying the existence of the gap in the barbed wire.<ref name="MacArthur, p. 66"/> The division's daily intelligence summary described the attack: {{quote|On the afternoon of October 16 the 84th Brigade by terrific and prolonged fighting against well organized and savage defense, succeeded in penetrating the Kriemhilde Stellung at its apex on the C<U+00F4>te-de-Ch<U+00E2>ttillon which is said to be the strongest point between the Argonne and the Meuse. At this point there is a heavily wooded slope with strong wire. Here a large garrison with artillery support and the usual large supply of machine guns on which the enemy base their defense, offered grim battle and was driven back by the furious attacks of our infantry. We now hold C<U+00F4>te-de-Ch<U+00E2>ttillon, and have organized the forward slope of the hill against possible counterattacks. Two enemy attacks to dislodge us during the afternoon were complete failures.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferrell|2008|p=64}}</ref>}}      

Summerall nominated MacArthur for the Medal of Honor and promotion to major general but he received neither.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=223}}</ref> Instead he was awarded an [[oak leaf cluster]] to his Distinguished Service Cross, "the citation of which," MacArthur wrote, "more than satisfied my martial vanity."<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=67}}</ref> The 42nd Division returned to the line for the last time on the night of November 4<U+2013>5.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=227<U+2013>228}}</ref> In the final advance on [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]], it became involved in what MacArthur considered "narrowly missed being one of the great tragedies of American history."<ref name="MacArthur, p. 68">{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=68}}</ref> An order to disregard unit boundaries led to units crossing into each others' zones. In the resulting chaos, MacArthur was taken prisoner by men of the 1st Division, who mistook him for a German general.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=232<U+2013>233}}</ref> His performance in the attack on the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] heights led to his being awarded a seventh Silver Star. On November 10, a day before the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|armistice]] that ended the fighting, Moneher became commander of [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]] and MacArthur was appointed commander of the 42nd Division. For his service as chief of staff and commander of the 84th Infantry Brigade, MacArthur was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]].<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=239<U+2013>240}}</ref> MacArthur's period in command was brief, for on November 22 he, like other brigadier generals, was replaced, and returned to the 84th Infantry Brigade. The 42nd Division was chosen to participate in the occupation of the [[Rhineland]], occupying the [[Ahrweiler]] district.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=241<U+2013>245}}</ref> In April 1919, they entrained for [[Brest, France|Brest]] and [[St Nazaire]], where it boarded ships to return to the United states.

==Between the wars==
===Superintendent of the United States Military Academy===
In 1919 MacArthur became [[Superintendents of the United States Military Academy|Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point]], which Chief of Staff [[Peyton March]] felt that had become out of date in many respects and was much in need of reform.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=77.}}</ref> Accepting the post meant that MacArthur became a permanent brigadier general in January 1920,<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=263.}}</ref> instead of being reduced to his substantive rank of major like many of his contemporaries.<ref>{{harvnb|Manchester|1978|p=117.}}</ref> When MacArthur moved into the superintendent's house with his mother in June 1919,<ref name="James, p. 265">{{harvnb|James|1970|p=265.}}</ref> he became the youngest superintendent since [[Sylvanus Thayer]] in 1817.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=261.}}</ref> However, whereas Thayer had faced opposition from outside the Army, MacArthur had to overcome "intense and sometimes fanatical resistance" from graduates and the academic board.<ref>{{harvnb|Leary|2001|p=10.}}</ref>

MacArthur's vision of what was required of an officer came not just from his recent experience of combat in France but also from that of the occupation of the Rhineland in Germany. The military government of the Rhineland had required the Army to deal with political, economic and social problems but he had found that many West Point graduates had little or no knowledge of fields outside the military.<ref name="James, p. 265"/> During the war, West Point had been reduced to an officer candidate school. Five classes had been graduated in two years and the class of 1922 was scheduled to graduate in June 1920. However, in May 1919, the three year course had been restored and the class of 1921 had been sent back to school, causing much resentment.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=262<U+2013>263.}}</ref> Cadet and staff morale was low and hazing "at an all-time peak of viciousness."<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=262.}}</ref> MacArthur's first battle turned out to be the easiest. Congress had set the length of the course at three years. MacArthur was able to get the four-year course restored.<ref name="Ambrose, p. 11">{{harvnb|Leary|2001|p=11.}}</ref>

During the debate over the length of the course the ''[[New York Times]]'' brought up the issue of the cloistered and undemocratic nature of student life at West Point.<ref name="Ambrose, p. 11"/> A prominent public critic of the curriculum was Professor [[Charles William Eliot]], the former [[President of Harvard University]], who took West Point to task for its narrow academic focus, poorly prepared courses, and the use of recent graduates with no teaching experience as instructors. He saw this as the root of the difficulties encountered by West Pointers in World War I in adapting to new new methods of warfare and administration.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=271<U+2013>272.}}</ref> Starting with Harvard University in 1869, civilian universities had begun grading students on academic performance alone, but West Point had retained the old "whole man" concept of education. MacArthur did not approve of this trend, but sought to modernize the system, expanding the concept of military character to include bearing, leadership, efficiency and athletic performance. He formalized the as hitherto unwritten [[Cadet Honor Code]] in 1922 when he formed the Cadet Honor Committee to review honor allegations.<ref>{{harvnb|Leary|2001|pp=24<U+2013>25.}}</ref> 

Recalling his own experience with hazing, MacArthur attempted to combat it by using officers rather than upperclassmen to train the [[plebe]]s. Instead of the traditional summer camp at [[Fort Clinton]], MacArthur had the cadets trained to use modern weapons by regular army sergeants at [[Fort Dix]], then march back to West Point with full packs.<ref name="James 1970 278<U+2013>279">{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=278<U+2013>279.}}</ref> MacArthur tried to modernize the curriculum by adding liberal arts, government and economics courses, but encountered strong resistance from the Academic Board. In Military Art classes the study of the campaigns of the [[American Civil War]] was replaced with the study of those of World War I. In History class, more emphasis was placed on the [[Far East]]. In English class cadets were required to read two newspapers per day and discuss the day's news for ten minutes. In Chemistry class instruction was added on the internal combustion engine. In [[Natural Philosophy]] class cadets were permitted to use [[slide rule]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Leary|2001|pp=16<U+2013>17.}}</ref> MacArthur expanded the sports program, increasing the number of intramural sports and requiring all cadets to participate.<ref>{{harvnb|Leary|2001|pp=20<U+2013>21.}}</ref> MacArthur allowed upper class cadets to leave the reservation. He also permitted them to start a cadet newspaper, ''The Brag'', the forerunner of today's ''West Pointer'', allowed cadets to travel to watch their football team play, and even gave them an allowance of $5.00 a month. Professors and alumni alike protested these radical moves.<ref name="James 1970 278<U+2013>279"/>  

In October 1922, MacArthur left West Point for the Philippines. Rumors circulated that after MacArthur became romantically involved with socialite [[Louise Cromwell Brooks]], the divorced wife of Walter Brooks Jr, and the stepdaughter of [[Edward T. Stotesbury]], a wealthy Philadelphia banker, General Pershing, who was fond of Brooks, had exiled MacArthur. This was denied by Pershing as "all damn poppycock." MacArthur married Brooks on February 14, 1922 at her family's Spanish-style villa in [[Palm Beach, Florida]].<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=291.}}</ref>  Most of MacArthur's reforms were soon discarded. But he had brought a new spirit to West Point and over the following years, his ideas would become accepted and his innovations slowly restored.<ref name="Ambrose, pp. 26-27">{{harvnb|Leary|2001|pp=26<U+2013>27.}}</ref>

===Army's youngest major general===
MacArthur reached the Philippines in October 1922 to assume command of the Military District of Manila. The islands were peaceful now and in the wake of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], the garrison was being reduced.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=295<U+2013>297.}}</ref> MacArthur's close friendships with Filipinos like [[Manuel Quezon]] offended some people. "The old idea of colonial exploitation," he later conceded, "still had its vigorous supporters."<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=84.}}</ref> In February and March 1923 MacArthur returned to Washington to see his mother, who was ill from a heart ailment. She recovered, but it was the last time he saw his brother Arthur, who died suddenly from [[appendicitis]] in December 1923. In June 1923 MacArthur assumed command of the 23rd Infantry Brigade of the [[Philippine Division]]. On July 7, 1924 MacArthur was informed that a [[mutiny]] had broken out amongst the [[Philippine Scouts]] over grievances concerning their pay and allowances. Over 200 scouts were arrested and there were fears of an insurrection. MacArthur, who was known to favor equal status for the Scouts, was appointed to command the Philippine Division, but his efforts to improve the salaries of Filipino troops were frustrated by financial stringency and racial prejudice. On January 17, 1925 he was promoted, becoming the Army's youngest major general.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=300<U+2013>305.}}</ref>

Returning to the United states, MacArthur took command of the [[Corps area|IV Corps Area]], based at [[Fort McPherson]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], on May 2, 1925. A few months later he assumed command of the III Corps area, based at [[Fort McHenry]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], which allowed MacArthur and Louise to move to her [[Horace Trumbauer]]-designed Rainbow Hill estate near [[Garrison, Maryland]]. It also meant he was closer to his mother, now living with Arthur's widow in Washington, DC.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=305<U+2013>306.}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://wikimapia.org/10016260/Brooklands-Rainbow-Hill |title=Brooklands/Rainbow Hill |accessdate=March 2, 2010}}</ref> However, it led to what he later described as "one of the most distasteful orders I ever received":<ref name="MacArthur, p. 85">{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=85.}}</ref> an order to serve on the [[court martial]] of Brigadier General [[Billy Mitchell]]. MacArthur was the youngest of the thirteen judges, none of whom had aviation experience and three of whom, including Summerall, the president of the court, were removed when defense challenges revealed bias against Mitchell. MacArthur later claimed he had voted to acquit, and [[Fiorello La Guardia]] claimed that MacArthur's "not guilty" ballot had been found in the judges' anteroom. Nonetheless, the verdict required only a two-thirds majority and Mitchell was found guilty as charged and convicted.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=307<U+2013>310.}}</ref> MacArthur felt "that a senior officer should not be silenced for being at variance with his superiors in rank and with accepted doctrine."<ref name="MacArthur, p. 85"/>

In 1927, MacArthur and Louise separated and she moved to New York City, leasing the 26th floor of the Hotel Beverly on East [[50th Street (Manhattan)|50th Street]] and [[Lexington Avenue (Manhattan)|Lexington Avenue]].<ref name="James, p. 322">{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=322.}}</ref> In August 1927 [[William C. Prout]], the president of the [[United States Olympic Committee]], died suddenly and the committee elected MacArthur as their new president. His main task was to prepare the U.S. team for the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in [[Amsterdam]]. On July 7, with only days to go before they were to leave aboard the {{USS|Joseph T. Dickman|APA-13|6}}, a dispute arose over [[Charlie Paddock]]'s status as an amateur, and whether he should be allowed to participate. MacArthur determined that Paddock should compete, and eventually the [[International Olympic Committee]] agreed with him. As a sports fan, MacArthur enjoyed the Olympics and was proud of the performance of his team. Upon returning to the United States, he received orders to assume command of the [[Philippine Department]].<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=325<U+2013>332.}}</ref> While he was in Manila, Louise obtained a divorce in [[Reno, Nevada]] on June 18, 1929, ostensibly on the grounds of "failure to provide".<ref>{{citation|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70717FD3D54157A93CAA8178DD85F4D8285F9 |title=Wife Divorces General M'Arthur |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=June 18, 1929 |accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref>

===Chief of Staff===
By 1930, MacArthur was still, at age 50, the youngest of the U.S. Army's major generals, but the most senior of those with four or more years left before reaching the age of compulsory retirement at age 64. He was also by far the best known, from his time at West Point and his presidency of the Olympic Committee.<ref name="James, pp. 340-347"/> President [[Herbert Hoover]] offered him the post of [[Chief of Engineers]] but he declined. The job went to Brigadier General [[Lytle Brown]] instead.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|pp=88<U+2013>89}}</ref> His seniority made MacArthur the natural choice to appoint as Chief of Staff. He left the Philippines on September 19, 1930 and for a brief time was in command of the IX Corps Area in San Francisco,<ref name="James, pp. 340-347">{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=340<U+2013>347}}</ref> living in the house his father had once occupied at Fort Mason. On November 21, 1930 MacArthur was sworn in as Chief of Staff, with the rank of general.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=89}}</ref>

The onset of the [[Great Depression]] caused Congress to make deep cuts in the Army's personnel and budget. Some 53 bases were closed and Major [[Adna R. Chaffee, Jr.]]'s experimental mechanized force had to be disbanded, but MacArthur managed to fight off attempts to reduce the number of regular officers from 12,000 to 10,000.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=357<U+2013>361}}</ref> The Army budget was repeatedly cut from $347 million in 1931 to $335 million the next year, $304 million in 1933 and $277 million in 1934 before being increased to $284 million in 1935.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=99}}</ref> As the international situation became more alarming, Macarthur obtained $355 million for 1936.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=448<U+2013>449}}</ref>    

MacArthur's main programs included the development of new mobilization plans. He grouped the nine corps areas together under four armies, which were charged with responsibility for training and frontier defense.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=367}}</ref> MacArthur negotiated the [[MacArthur-Pratt agreement]] with the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William V. Pratt]]. This was the first of a series of inter-service agreements over the following decades that defined the responsibilities of the different services with respect to aviation. This agreement placed coastal air defense under the Army, which then proceeded to initiate a design competition for an aircraft to fulfil that role, which eventually became the [[B-17 Flying Fortress]].<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=368<U+2013>371}}</ref> In March 1935, MacArthur activated a centralized air command, [[General Headquarters Air Force]] under Major General [[Frank M. Andrews]].<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=458<U+2013>460}}</ref>

[[File:Bonus marchers 05510 2004 001 a.gif|thumb|right|300px|Bonus Army marchers confront the police.|alt= Police with batons confront demonstrators armed with bricks and clubs. A policeman and a demonstrator wrestle over a U.S. flag.]]
One of MacArthur's most controversial acts came in 1932, when the "[[Bonus Army]]" of veterans converged on Washington. MacArthur sent tents and camp equipment to the demonstrators, along with mobile kitchens, until an outburst in Congress caused the kitchens to be withdrawn.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=93}}</ref> MacArthur was concerned that the demonstration had been taken over by [[Communism|communists]] and [[Pacifism|pacifists]] but the General Staff's intelligence division reported that only three of the march's twenty-six key leaders were communists. MacArthur and Brigadier General Perry L. Miles, the commander of the 16th Infantry Brigade at [[Fort Myer]], went over contingency plans for civil disorder in the capital. Mechanized equipment was brought to Fort Myer, where anti-riot training was conducted.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=391<U+2013>392}}</ref> 

On July 28, 1932, a clash with demonstrators resulted in two men being shot by the police and President Hoover ordered MacArthur to "surround the affected area and clear it without delay."<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=94}}</ref> MacArthur brought up the 2nd Squadron, [[3d Armored Cavalry Regiment (United States)|3rd Cavalry]], of which Major [[George S. Patton]] was the executive officer; the 3rd Battalion, [[12th Infantry Regiment (United States)|12th Infantry]]; five [[tank]]s of Company B, [[66th Armor Regiment (United States)|1st Tank Regiment]]; and other units from Fort Myer, [[Fort Meade]], [[Fort Washington, Maryland|Fort Washington]] and [[Fort Howard (Maryland)|Fort Howard]]. Miles was in charge of the operation but, against the advice of Major [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], MacArthur decided to accompany the troops. MacArthur had worn a white suit to work that morning, so he sent an orderly to fetch his uniform from Fort Myer, and his mother gave him the one with his ribbons and medal, as if for a formal function at short notice.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=398<U+2013>399}}</ref> The operation commenced at 1630. The troops advanced with bayonets and [[saber]]s drawn under a shower of bricks and rocks, but no shots were fired. By 2000, the troops had cleared the area and the President ordered MacArthur to clear the Bonus Army's camp ground on the [[Battle of Anacostia Flats|Anacostia Flats]]. This was done using [[Adamsite|tear gas]], which started a number of fires, and caused the only death. Compared with other riots before and since, the operation was well-handled, but still a public relations disaster.<ref>{{harvnb|Leary|2001|pp=36<U+2013>38}}</ref> 

[[File:CCC constructing road.gif|thumb|left|240px|CCC workers constructing a road.]]
In 1934 MacArthur unwisely sued journalists [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]] and [[Robert S. Allen]] for defamation after they described his treatment of the Bonus marchers as "unwarranted, unnecessary, insubordinate, harsh and brutal." In turn, they threatened to call Isobel Rosario Cooper as a witness. MacArthur had met Isobel, a [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] woman, while in the Philippines, and she had become his mistress. MacArthur had brought her to San Francisco and then Washington, installing her in a suite at [[The Chastleton]] on [[16th Street Northwest (Washington, D.C.)|16th Street Northwest]]. MacArthur and Isobel officially split up on September 1, 1934, when he mailed her a train ticket to the West Coast and an ocean liner passage to Manila. She did not use them, and stayed in the United States. MacArthur was forced to settle out of court, secretly paying Pearson $15,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Machester|1978|pp=144<U+2013>145, 156}}</ref>      

President Hoover was defeated in the [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 election]] by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. MacArthur and Roosevelt had worked together before World War I and despite political differences, remained personal friends.  MacArthur enthusiastically supported the [[New Deal]] by operating the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC). MacArthur ensured that detailed plans were drawn up so that action could be taken as soon as the CCC bill was passed. He also decentralized its administration to the corps areas, which became an important factor in the success of the program.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=415<U+2013>420}}</ref> Although MacArthur's support for a strong military, and his public criticism of pacifism and [[isolationism]],<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=376<U+2013>377}}</ref> made him unpopular with the Roosevelt administration, Roosevelt extended MacArthur's term as Chief of Staff.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=445<U+2013>447}}</ref> MacArthur finally finished his tour as Chief of Staff in October 1935. 
For his service as chief of staff, he was awarded a second Distinguished Service Medal. He had also been retrospectively awarded the Purple Heart for his World War I service, having revived the order in 1932.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|pp=102<U+2013>103}}</ref>

===Field Marshal of the Philippine Army===
When the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] achieved semi-independent status in 1935, [[President of the Philippines]] [[Manuel L. Quezon]], a personal friend since his father had been Governor General, asked MacArthur to supervise the creation of a Philippine Army. MacArthur elected not to retire at age 55 but to remain on the active list as a major general, and with President Roosevelt's approval he accepted the assignment. It was agreed that MacArthur would receive a salary and allowances, and the rank of [[Field Marshal (Philippines)|field marshal]] from the Commonwealth in addition to his major general's salary as [[Office of the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines|Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines]].<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=479<U+2013>484.}}</ref> It was his fifth tour in the Far East. MacArthur sailed from San Francisco on [[SS President Hoover|SS ''President Hoover'']] in October 1935,<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=103.}}</ref> accompanied by his mother and sister-in-law.Because his mother was in poor health, they were accompanied by Major Howard J. Hutter, the family physician. MacArthur also brought his long time [[aide de camp]], Captain Thomas J. Davis; and Major Eisenhower and Major [[James B. Ord]], a friend of Eisenhower's, as his assistants.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=485<U+2013>486.}}</ref> MacArthur's mother became gravely ill during the voyage and died in Manila on December 3, 1935. In 1937, MacArthur later took her remains back to the United States, where she was interred beside his father in [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. Also aboard the ''President Hoover'' was [[Jean MacArthur|Jean Marie Faircloth]], a vivacious, unmarried 37 year old socialite. Over the next two years, the two were frequently seen together.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=494<U+2013>495.}}</ref>

President Quezon officially conferred the title of field marshal on MacArthur in a ceremony at [[Malaca<U+00F1>ang Palace]] on August 24, 1936. He was presented with a gold baton and a unique uniform.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=505.}}</ref> The Philippine Army was patterned after that of [[Switzerland]]. It was formed from universal conscription. The idea was to train 40,000 men per annum at 128 camps. Training was to be conducted by a regular cadre, and the [[Philippine Military Academy]] was created along the lines of West Point to train its officers.<ref name="MacArthur, pp. 103-104"/> MacArthur and Eisenhower found that the process of forming the army was not far advanced. Few of the training camps had been constructed and the first group of 20,000 trainees would not report for duty until early 1937.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|p=504.}}</ref> Equipment and weapons were "more or less obsolete" American cast offs, and the budget of $6 million was completely inadequate.<ref name="MacArthur, pp. 103-104">{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|pp=103<U+2013>105.}}</ref> By 1939, the United States had supplied the Philippines with $6 million of equipment.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=547.}}</ref> Much hope was placed in the [[Philippine Army Air Corps]], but the first squadron was not organized until 1939. Eisenhower became so interested in the pilot training program that he learned to fly himself. However, Ord was killed in 1938 flying when a plane piloted by one of the Filipino airmen crashed,<ref>{{harvnb|James|1970|pp=531<U+2013>532.}}</ref> and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel [[Richard K.

In 1937, MacArthur accompanied Quezon on a visit to Japan, Mexico and the United States. Quezon was warmly welcomed in Mexico but virtually ignored in the United States. MacArthur's requests for equipment for the Philippine Army fell on deaf ears at the War Department, but at the Navy Department MacArthur and the Naval Advisor on his staff, [[Lieutenant]] Sidney L.

====Preparations====
On July 26, 1941 Roosevelt federalized the Philippine Army and recalled MacArthur to active duty in the U.S. Army as a major general and named him commander of [[U.S. Army Forces in the Far East]] (USAFFE). MacArthur was promoted to lieutenant general the following day.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|1953|p=19}}</ref> On December 20, MacArthur became a four star general yet again. At the same time, Sutherland was promoted to major general and Colonels Akin, Marshall, and Casey to brigadier general.<ref>{{harvnb|Rogers|1990|p=100}}</ref> On July 31, 1941 the Philippine Department had 22,000 troops assigned, 12,000 of whom were Philippine Scouts. The main component was the Philippine Division, under the command of Major General [[Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV|Jonathan M. Wainwright]].<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|1953|p=21}}</ref> Between July and December 1941 the garrison received 8,500 reinforcements.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|1953|p=50}}</ref> These included the 192nd and 194th Tank Battalions, each equipped with 54 [[Stuart tank|M3 light tanks]]m and the [[200th Coast Artillery (United States)|200th Coastal Artillery Regiment (AA)]], equipped with 12 [[3-inch Gun M1918|3-inch]] and 24 [[37mm Gun M1|37mm]] guns.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|1953|p=33}}</ref> After years of parsimony, much equipment was shipped. It included 125,000 steel helmets, 500,000 [[C-ration]]s and enough 55-gallon drums to hold {{convert|1000000|gal|l}} of gasoline. By November, a backlog of 1,100,000 shipping tons of equipment intended for the Philippines had accumulated in U.S. ports and depots awaiting vessels.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|1953|pp=35<U+2013>37}}</ref>   

In July 1941, the air force in the Philippines was largely equipped with obsolete [[P-26 Peashooter|P-26]] and [[Seversky P-35|P-35]] fighters and [[Martin B-10|B-10]] and [[B-18 Bolo|B-18]] bombers. This changed with the arrival of the [[19th Bombardment Group]] with 35 [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] bombers. The Philippines also received 107 new [[Curtiss P-40#Variants and development stages|P<U+2013>40E]] fighters.<ref name="Morton, pp. 42-43">{{harvnb|Morton|1953|pp=42<U+2013>43}}</ref> Along with the new aircraft, the Commander of [[U.S. Army Air Forces]], General [[Henry H. Arnold]] moved to replace the air commander, Brigadier General [[Henry B. Clagett]], "a heavy-drinking old timer who suffered from high blood pressure, hardening arteries, and tertiary malaria."<ref name="Miller, p. 22">{{harvnb|Miller|2002|p=22}}</ref> In September MacArthur was asked to select a new air commander and chose Major General [[Lewis H. Brereton]].<ref name="Miller, p. 22"/> On November 16, Brereton activated [[Far East Air Force (United States)|Far East Air Force]] (FEAF) with three subordinate commands, [[V Bomber Command]] under Colonel Eugene L. Eubank, [[V Interceptor Command]] under Clagett, and Far East Air Service Command under Colonel Lawrence S. Churchill. Colonel [[Harold H. George]] served initially as chief of logistics, but by December 8 was chief of staff for [[V Interceptor Command]].<ref>{{harvnb|Miller|2002|p=24}}</ref> MacArthur was allocated over $2 million for airfield development in August and another $7 million in October. Work on [[Del Monte Airfield]] was rushed to get it ready to receive B-17s by the beginning of December. In addition, $190,000 was allocated for the construction of a aircraft warning system but the unit intended to man it had only made it as far as San Francisco by December, and there were only two operational [[radar]] sets.<ref name="Morton, pp. 42-43"/>

====Disaster at Clark Field====
General Sutherland found out about the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] from commercial broadcasts at 0330 local time on December 8, 1941 and informed MacArthur. General Brereton arrived at MacArthur's headquarters at 0500 seeking permission to use the B-17s at [[Clark Air Base|Clark Field]] in a daylight raid on [[Formosa]].<ref name="Morton, pp. 79-82">{{harvnb|Morton|1953|pp=79<U+2013>82}}</ref> MacArthur had ordered all the B-17s to be moved to Del Monte but only half had been sent, and that only at Sutherland's insistence, as another 35 B-17s were expected to arrive shortly and Del Monte could not accommodate that many.<ref name="Morton, pp. 88-90">{{harvnb|Morton|1953|pp=88<U+2013>90}}</ref> Brereton was told to make preparations but to await MacArthur's orders. At 0800, the heavy bombers were ordered aloft to patrol without bombs to avoid being caught on the ground. Brereton renewed his request at 1000 and Sutherland authorized a photographic reconnaissance mission over Formosa. After the war, Brereton claimed that he received a phone call from Sutherland authorizing a bombing raid on [[Taiwan|Formosa]], and scheduled it for late afternoon. MacArthur and Sutherland disputed Brereton's account.<ref name="Morton, pp. 88-90"/> By 1130 the bombers were back on the field, being armed with {{convert|100|lb|kg|adj=on}} and {{convert|300|lb|kg|adj=on}} bombs.<ref name="Morton, pp. 79-82"/> At 1145 they were caught on the ground by a Japanese air raid that struck Clark and the nearby fighter base at [[Iba Airfield|Iba Field]]. The 200th Coast Artillery discovered that its 3-inch ammunition, all manufactured before 1932, contained a high percentage of duds. Most of the P-35s and P-40s got into the air but found themselves outclassed by the Japanese [[A6M Zero]]s, seven of which were shot down. The B-17s were destroyed on the ground. In all, the Fair East Air Force lost 18 B-17s, 53 P-40s, 3 P-35s and more than 25 other aircraft. Substantial damage was done to the bases, and casualties totaled 80 killed and 150 wounded.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|1953|pp=84<U+2013>88}}</ref>

====Corregidor====
[[File:MacArthur and Sutherland s265357.jpg|thumb|right|200px|MacArthur (center) with his Chief of Staff, Major General Richard K. Sutherland, in the Headquarters tunnel on Corregidor, Philippines, 1 March 1942.]]
Prewar defense plans assumed the Japanese could not be prevented from landing on Luzon and called for U.S. and Filipino forces to abandon Manila and retreat with their supplies to the [[Bataan]] peninsula. MacArthur decided to slow the Japanese advance with an initial defense against the Japanese landings. In the event, the Japanese landed at [[Lingayen Gulf]] on December 21,<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|1953|p=125.}}</ref> and advanced rapidly. MacArthur's confidence in the ability of his Filipino troops was reconsidered, and he ordered a retreat to [[Battle of Bataan|Bataan]].<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|1953|p=163.}}</ref> Manila was declared an [[open city]] and on December 25 MacArthur moved his headquarters to the island fortress of [[Corregidor]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rogers|1990|pp=118<U+2013>121.}}</ref> A series of air raids destroyed all the exposed structures on the island and USAFFE headquarters moved into the [[Malinta Tunnel]]. Later most of the headquarters USAFFE moved to Bataan, leaving only the nucleus with MacArthur.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rogers|1990|pp=125<U+2013>141.}}</ref> The troops on Bataan knew that they had been written off but continued to fight. Some blamed Roosevelt and MacArthur for their predicament. A ballad sung to the tune of "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]" called him "Dugout Doug."<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=65<U+2013>66.}}</ref> However, most clung to the belief that somehow MacArthur "would reach down and pull something out of his hat."<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|p=68.}}</ref> 

On January 1, 1942 MacArthur was offered and accepted a payment of $500,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|.5|1941|r=1}}}} million in current value) from President Quezon of the Philippines as payment for his pre-war service. Besides MacArthur, staff members of MacArthur also received payments: $75,000 to Sutherland, $45,000 to Richard Marshall, and $20,000 to Huff.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rogers|1990|p=165.}}</ref> Eisenhower after being appointed Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force, was also offered money by Quezon, but Eisenhower refused the offer.<ref>{{harvnb|Halberstam|2007|p=372.}}</ref> These payments were known only to a few in Manila and Washington DC, including President Roosevelt and Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, until they were made public by historian Carol Petillo in 1979. The revelation tarnished MacArthur's reputation.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=860&dat=19800130&id=SjAQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lo8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6803,1835463 |newspaper=Ellensburg Daily Record |title=But writer says she has proof - Claims MacArthur took half million denied|date=Jan 30, 1980 |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}</ref>

====Escape to Australia====
In February 1942, as Japanese forces tightened their grip on the Philippines, MacArthur was ordered by President Roosevelt to relocate to [[Australia]]. MacArthur discussed the idea with his staff that he resign his commission and fight on as a private soldier in the Philippine resistance but Sutherland talked out of it.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|p=98}}</ref> On the night of March 12, 1942, MacArthur, with Jean, Arthur, and a select group that included Sutherland, [[Charles A. Willoughby|Willoughby]], Diller, Akin, George, Casey and Marshall, left Corregidor in four PT boats. MacArthur, his family and Sutherland traveled in<!--this is the correct usage, don't change it--> ''[[PT 41]]'', commanded by Lieutenant [[John D. Bulkeley]]. The others followed in ''[[PT 34]]'', ''[[PT 35]]'' and ''[[PT 32]]''. MacArthur and his party reached Del Monte on March 14. The commander of U.S. Army Forces in Australia, Lieutenant General [[George Brett (general)|George Brett]], sent four B-17s to pick them up. Two turned back with engine trouble and one crashed just short of its goal. One made it but was not fit to carry passengers and returned before MacArthur and his party arrived. A message to Chief of Staff [[George C. Marshall]] at the War Department released three new U.S. Navy B-17s for the mission. Two of them arrived, and brought the entire group to Australia.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|1953|pp=359<U+2013>360}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rogers|1990|pp=190<U+2013>192}}</ref> 

[[File:Douglas MacArthur MOH Plaque, USMA.JPG|left|thumb|200px|MacArthur's Medal of Honor plaque affixed to MacArthur barracks, USMA]]
MacArthur arrived at [[Batchelor Airfield]] in the [[Northern Territory]] on March 17, about {{convert|60|mi|km}} south of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], before flying to [[Alice Springs]], where he took [[the Ghan]] through the Australian [[outback]] to [[Adelaide, South Australia|Adelaide]]. His famous speech, in which he said, "I came out of Bataan and I shall return", was first made at [[Terowie]], a small railway township in [[South Australia]] on March 20. Upon his arrival in Adelaide, MacArthur abbreviated this to the now-famous, "I came through and I shall return" that made headlines.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=105<U+2013>106}}</ref> Washington asked MacArthur to amend his promise to, "We shall return". He ignored the request.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,974392-6,00.html |title=Part 2 Down but Not Out |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 2, 1991 |accessdate=8 March 2010}}</ref> MacArthur turned command over to Wainwright.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|1953|pp=360<U+2013>366}}</ref> Bataan eventually surrendered on April 9,<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|1953|pp=463<U+2013>467}}</ref>  and Wainwright surrendered on Corregidor on May 6.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|1953|p=561}}</ref> 

For his leadership in the defense of the Philippines, General Marshall decided to award MacArthur the Medal of Honor, the decoration for which he had twice previously been nominated. It was admitted that MacArthur had not actually performed acts of valor in battle on Bataan but the 1927 award to [[Charles Lindbergh]] set a precedent. Legislation had already been introduced in Congress by [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] [[J. Parnell Thomas]] and [[James E. Van Zandt]] to give MacArthur the award but Marshall felt it would more proper for it to come from the President and the War Department.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=129<U+2013>130}}</ref> The April 1, 1942 citation, written by Marshall, read:
{{quote|''For conspicuous leadership in preparing the Philippine Islands to resist conquest, for gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action against invading Japanese forces, and for the heroic conduct of defensive and offensive operations on the Bataan Peninsula. He mobilized, trained, and led an army which has received world acclaim for its gallant defense against a tremendous superiority of enemy forces in men and arms. His utter disregard of personal danger under heavy fire and aerial bombardment, his calm judgment in each crisis, inspired his troops, galvanized the spirit of resistance of the Filipino people, and confirmed the faith of the American people in their Armed Forces.''<ref name=AMOHW>{{citation |accessdate=August 3, 2009 |url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/wwII-m-s.html |title = U.S. Army Center of Military History Medal of Honor citations archive |publisher= Army Medal of Honor website}}</ref>}}
MacArthur chose to accept the medal on the basis that "this award was intended not so much for me personally as it is a recognition of the indomitable courage of the gallant army which it was my honor to command."<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|p=132}}</ref> Arthur and Douglas MacArthur became the first father and son to be awarded the Medal of Honor. They remained the only pair until 2001 when [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was awarded one posthumously for his service during the [[Spanish American War]], [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.]] having received one posthumously for his service during World War II.<ref>{{citation |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0101/16/se.04.html |title=President Clinton Awards Medals of Honor to Corporal Andrew Jackson Smith and President Teddy Roosevelt |accessdate=8 March 2010}}</ref>

====General Headquarters====
On April 18, 1942, MacArthur was appointed Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]] (SWPA). Brett became Commander, Allied Air Forces, and [[Vice Admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[Herbert F. Leary]] became Commander, Allied Naval Forces. Since the bulk of land forces in the theater was Australian, General Marshall insisted an Australian be appointed as Commander, Allied Land Forces, and the job went to [[General (Australia)|General]] Sir [[Thomas Blamey]]. Although predominantly Australian and American, MacArthur's command also included small numbers of personnel from the [[Netherlands East Indies]], the [[United Kingdom]], and other countries.<ref name="Milner, pp. 18-23"/> MacArthur established a close relationship with the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[John Curtin]],<ref>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography

The staff of MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) was built around the nucleus that had escaped from the Philippines with him, who became known as the "Bataan Gang".<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|p=80}}</ref> Marshall pressed for Dutch and Australian officers to be assigned to GHQ, but the heads of all the staff divisions were American and such officers of other nationalities as were assigned served under them.<ref name="Milner, pp. 18-23">{{harvnb|Milner|1957|pp=18<U+2013>23}}</ref> GHQ was initially located in [[Melbourne]], at [[Trustees Executors & Agency Company Building|401 Collins Street]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rogers|1990|p=202}}</ref> On July 20, 1942, SWPA headquarters was moved to [[Brisbane]], this being the northernmost city in Australia with the necessary communications facilities,<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|1957|p=48}}</ref> taking over the [[MacArthur Central, Brisbane|AMP Insurance Society building]].

MacArthur formed his own [[signals intelligence]] organisation, known as the [[Central Bureau]], from Australian intelligence units and American [[Station 6]] cryptanalysts of who had escaped from the Philippines. The unit was commanded by MacArthurs Chief Signals Officer, Brigadier General [[Spencer B. Akin]],<ref>{{harvnb|Drea|1992|pp=18<U+2013>19}}</ref> with three experienced codebreakers, Major [[Abraham Sinkov]], [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] Roy Booth and Major Alastair Sanford of the [[Australian Army]], as his deputies.

====Papuan Campaign====
Anticipating that the Japanese would strike at [[Port Moresby]] again, the garrison was strengthened and MacArthur ordered the establishment of new bases at [[Merauke]] and [[Milne Bay]] to cover its flanks.<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|1957|pp=39<U+2013>41.}}</ref> The [[Battle of Midway]] in June 1942 led to plans to exploit this victory with a limited offensive in the Pacific. MacArthur's proposal for an attack on the main Japanese base at Rabaul met with objections from the U.S. navy, which favored a less ambitious approach, and objected to an Army general being in command of what would be an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious operation]], at least in the early stages. The resulting compromise called for a three stage advance, with the first, the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|seizure of the Tulagi area]] being conducted by the [[South Pacific Area]] while the later stages came under MacArthur.<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|1957|pp=46<U+2013>48.}}</ref>

The Japanese struck first, [[Invasion of Buna-Gona|landing at Buna]] in July,<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|1957|pp=53<U+2013>55.}}</ref> and at [[Battle of Milne Bay|Milne Bay]] in August. The Australians soon defeated the Japanese at Milne Bay,<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|1957|pp=77-88.}}</ref> but a series of defeats in the [[Kokoda Track campaign]] had a depressing effect back in Australia. On 30 August, MacArthur radioed Washington that unless action was taken, [[New Guinea Force]] would be overwhelmed. [[Major General (Australia)|Major General]] [[George Alan Vasey]] wrote that "GHQ is like a bloody barometer in a cyclone<U+2014>up and down every two minutes".<ref name="McCarthy, p. 225">{{harvnb|McCarthy|1959|p=225.}}</ref> MacArthur informed George Marshall that "the Australians have proven themselves unable to match the enemy in jungle fighting.

Having committed all the available Australian troops, MacArthur decided to send American troops. The [[U.S. I Corps]] commander, Major General [[Robert L. Eichelberger]], selected the [[32nd Infantry Division (United States)|32nd Infantry Division]], a poorly trained [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] division, to carry out a flanking movement.<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|1957|pp=91<U+2013>92.}}</ref> A series embarrassing American reverses in the [[Battle of Buna-Gona]] led to outspoken criticism of the American troops by Blamey.

MacArthur found it particularly difficult to work with Brett. Sutherland in particular experienced frustration with the stream of excuses from Brett as to why requested operations could not be carried out. In march, Brett informed Sutherland that he could not carry out a requested mission to the Philippines because "his exhausted pilots and worn-out planes had all they could do to keep the Japanese out of Port Moresby."<ref name="Roger, pp. 275-278">{{harvnb|Rogers|1990|pp=275<U+2013>278.}}</ref> On MacArthur's insistence, the mission was flown anyway by Brigadier General [[Ralph Royce]],<ref>{{harvnb|Craven|Cate|1948|pp=417<U+2013>418.}}</ref> the results of the Battle of the Coral Sea made Brett's assessment seem optimistic. Finally, on June 26, MacArthur asked General Marshall to replace Brett.<ref name="Roger, pp. 275-278"/> MacArthur was given a choice of [[Jimmy Doolittle|James H.

====Operation Cartwheel====
[[File:Elkton Plan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Elkton III Plan, March 1943.|alt=Topographic map of Papua New Guinea with arrows indicating an Allied advance along the northern coast towards the Admiralty Islands.]]
At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] approved the latest version of General MacArthur's plan for [[Operation Cartwheel]], an advance on Rabaul. Owing to a shortage of resources, particularly [[heavy bomber]] aircraft, the final stage of the plan, the capture of Rabaul itself, was postponed until 1944.<ref>{{harvnb|Hayes|1982|pp=312<U+2013>334.}}</ref> MacArthur explained his strategy:
{{quote|My strategic conception for the Pacific Theater, which I outlined after the Papuan Campaign and have since consistently advocated, contemplates massive strokes against only main strategic objectives, utilizing surprise and air-ground striking power supported and assisted by the fleet. This is the very opposite of what is termed "island hopping" which is the gradual pushing back of the enemy by direct frontal pressure with the consequent heavy casualties which will certainly be involved. Key points must of course be taken but a wise choice of such will obviate the need for storming the mass of islands now in enemy possession. "Island hopping" with extravagant losses and slow progress...is not my idea of how to end the war as soon and as cheaply as possible. New conditions require for solution and new weapons require for maximum application new and imaginative methods. Wars are never won in the past.<ref>{{harvnb|Willoughby|1966|p=100.}}</ref>}}

Lieutenant General [[Walter Krueger]]'s [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth Army]] headquarters arrived in SWPA in early 1943 but MacArthur still had only three American divisions, the 32nd and [[41st Infantry Division (United States)|41st Infantry Division]]s and the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]], and they were tired and depleted from the fighting at Buna and Guadalcanal. As a result, "it became obvious that any military offensive in the South-West Pacific in 1943 would have to be carried out mainly by the Australian Army, just as during the bitter campaigns of 1942."<ref>{{harvnb|Dexter|1961|p=12.}}</ref> 

In a country without roads, large-scale movement had to be by air or water. During the Buna fighting the Navy had balked at Blamey's requests to risk its warships in poorly chartered waters where the Japanese had air superiority, and MacArthur lacked the authority to compel the Navy to comply.<ref>{{harvnb|Rogers|1990|pp=345<U+2013>346.}}</ref> One solution was the [[Engineer Special Brigade (United States)|engineer special brigades]]. Each brigade had 550 landing craft, 360 officers and 7,000 men, organized into three boat and shore regiments.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1959|pp=21<U+2013>30.}}</ref> Each regiment was capable of transporting an American infantry regiment or an Australian infantry brigade up to {{convert|60|mi|km}}, and to establish, support and maintain a beachhead there.<ref>{{harvnb|Dexter|1961|pp=255<U+2013>266.}}</ref> Deliveries of landing craft to SWPA had been slow because they had to be shipped as deck cargo on freighters bound for Australia, limiting their numbers to about 60 per month, but a plan was developed to ship disassembled landing crafts and assemble them in Australia. MacArthur requested three brigades,<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1959|pp=31<U+2013>33.}}</ref> the first which, the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade, arrived in SWPA in February and March 1943.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1959|p=38.}}</ref> Their range could be greatly extended by the landing ships of Rear Admiral [[Daniel E.

Long-range [[P-38 Lightning]] fighters began arriving in late 1942 but deliveries to SWPA were suspended owing to the demands of [[Operation Torch]].<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|p=220.}}</ref>

[[File:C-47 transport planes loaded for Nadzab.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Generals Kenney and MacArthur watch C-47 transport planes loaded with paratroops for the drop at Nadzab.]]
The main offensive began with the [[landing at Lae]] by the [[9th Division (Australia)|Australian 9th Division]] and the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade on September 4, 1943. The next day MacArthur watched the [[landing at Nadzab]] by [[paratroops]] of the [[503rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|503rd Parachute Infantry]] from a B-17 circling overhead. The B-17 made the trip on three engines because one failed soon after leaving Port Moresby, but MacArthur insisted that it fly on to Nadzab.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|p=327.}}</ref> For this, MacArthur was awarded the [[Air Medal]]. His citation read: {{quote|On September 5, 1943, General MacArthur, in a B-17 bomber called the ''Talisman'', personally led the American paratroopers on the very successful and important jump against the Nadzab airstrip. General MacArthur flew through enemy infested airlanes and skillfully directed this historic operation which was accomplished with the greatest success and made possible the later landings of Australian airborne troops and the closing of the western inland approaches of the Markham Valley. He remained over the combat area until all paratroops had landed in initial contact with the enemy in this battle.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=179.}}</ref>}} Vasey's [[7th Division (Australia)|Australian 7th Division]] advanced on Lae, which fell on September 16. MacArthur advanced his timetable, and ordered the 7th Division to capture [[Battle of Kaiapit|Kaiapit]] and [[Ramu Valley campaign|Dumpu]], while the 9th Division mounted an [[Battle of Finschhafen|amphibious assault on Finschhafen]]. Here, the offensive bogged down. Part of the problem was that MacArthur had based his decision to assault Finschhafen on Willoughby's assessment that there were only 350 Japanese defenders at Finschhafen when there were actually nearly 5,000. A furious battle ensued.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=328<U+2013>329.}}</ref>

[[File:Landings to Western New Guinea.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Westward Drive along New Guinea February - July 1944]]
While MacArthur's troops advanced towards Rabaul, the Joint Chiefs of Staff moved towards a consensus that Rabaul could be neutralized rather than seized.<ref>{{harvnb|Hayes|1982|pp=425<U+2013>429.}}</ref> MacArthur did not agree, and still wished to establish a base there. In early November, Sutherland came to Washington to present Reno III, MacArthur's plan for a westward advance along to coast of New Guinea to the Philippines. The plan met with general approval, and was incorporated into plans for the war against Japan approved at the [[Sextant Conference]], although a decision on the final phases was deferred.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=364<U+2013>365.}}</ref>
<ref>{{harvnb|Hayes|1982|pp=487<U+2013>490.}}</ref> An opportunity to speed up the advance presented itself in February 1944 when airmen reported that there were no signs of enemy activity in the [[Admiralty Islands]]. MacArthur ordered a [[reconnaissance in force]] of the islands, despite Willoughby's assessment that there were 4,000 Japanese troops in the Admiralty Islands. MacArthur accompanied the assault force in {{USS|Phoenix|CL-46|6}}, the flagship of Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, who had recently replaced Carpender as commander of the Seventh Fleet and went ashore six hours after the first assault troops. It was obvious that Willoughby had been correct, but MacArthur judged that the position could be held. A night of "bizarre and bloody" fighting followed, but the Japanese attacks were beaten off and the island was ultimately overrun.<ref>{{harvnb|Willoughby|1966|pp=137<U+2013>141.}}</ref> For his part, MacArthur was awarded the [[Bronze Star]].<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=189.}}</ref>

MacArthur now proposed to bypass the Japanese forces at [[Hansa Bay]] and [[Wewak]], and assault [[Landing at Hollandia|Hollandia]] and [[Landing at Aitape|Aitape]]. These were out of range out the Fifth Air Force's fighters based in the Ramu Valley, but the timing allowed for the operation to be supported by the [[aircraft carriers]]s of the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]], although for no more than a couple of days.<ref>{{harvnb|Willoughby|1966|pp=142<U+2013>143.}}</ref> The operation was therefore risky. It also turned out to be a brilliant success. MacArthur caught the Japanese off balance, and cut off Lieutenant General [[Hataz<U+014D> Adachi]]'s [[Eighteenth Army (Japan)|Japanese XVIII Army]] in the Wewak area. Because the Japanese were not expecting an attack, the garrison was weak, and Allied casualties were correspondingly light. This also eased GHQ's logistical difficulties. However, the terrain turned out to be less suitable for large scale airbase development than first thought, forcing MacArthur to seek better locations further west. Moreover, while bypassing Japanese forces had great tactical merit, it had the serious strategic drawback of tying up large numbers of Allied troops in order to contain them. And last, but by no means least, Adachi was far from beaten. In the [[Battle of Driniumor River]], he would bring on "the New Guinea campaign's bloodiest and most strategically useless battle."<ref>{{harvnb|Taafe|1998|pp=100<U+2013>103.}}</ref>

===Philippines Campaign (1944<U+2013>45)===
====Leyte====
[[File:FDR conference 1944 HD-SN-99-02408.JPEG|thumb|right|200px|Conference in Hawaii, September 1944. Left to right: General MacArthur, President Roosevelt, Admiral Leahy, Admiral Nimitz.]]
In July 1944, President Roosevelt summoned MacArthur to meet with him in [[Hawaii]]. Also present were the local commanders, Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]], the Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Fleet and Commander in Chief, [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas]]; Admiral [[William Halsey, Jr.]], the commander of the [[United States Third Fleet|Third Fleet]]; and Lieutenant General [[Robert C. Richardson, Jr.]], the commander of U.S. Army forces in the theater. The Joint Chiefs of Staff were not present, except for Admiral Leahy. It was Roosevelt's first overseas trip without them. Roosevelt announced that the conference had been called "to determine the phase of action against Japan." Nimitz and MacArthur agreed that the next step should be to advance on the southern and central Philippines. They disagreed over whether the subsequent objective should be Formosa or Luzon, as MacArthur advocated. MacArthur emphasized the moral and political issues involved in a decision to liberate or bypass Luzon. He also spoke briefly of his plan to use the Australian Army to liberate Indonesia. The conference concluded amicably. Although the issue was not settled, both Roosevelt and Leahy were convinced of the soundness of MacArthur's plan.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=526<U+2013>533.}}</ref>

In September, Halsey's carriers made a series of air strikes on the central and southern Philippines. Opposition was feeble and Halsey decided that [[Leyte]] was "wide open" and possibly undefended. Halsey recommended that projected operations be skipped in favor of an assault on Leyte. George Marshall radioed MacArthur for his opinion of such a drastic change of plans. MacArthur was unavailable, as he was aboard {{USS|Nashville|CL-43|6}} ''en route'' for the [[Battle of Morotai|landing on Morotai]] and traveling under radio silence, so the decision fell on Sutherland. Sutherland knew full well that Halsey was terribly wrong. He also knew what MacArthur's response would be. George Marshall was dining in [[Quebec City]] with [[Mackenzie King]] and the other Joint Chiefs when he received Sutherland's affirmative reply. Within minutes they sent new orders to Nimitz and MacArthur.<ref>{{harvnb|Drea|1992|pp=152<U+2013>159.}}</ref>    

[[File:Douglas MacArthur lands Leyte1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|"I have returned" <U+2014> General MacArthur returns to the Philippines.]]
On October 20, 1944, troops of Krueger's Sixth Army [[Battle of Leyte|landed on Leyte]]. The assault troops soon secured most of their first day objectives. MacArthur watched from the {{USS|Nashville|CL-43|2}}. That afternoon he boarded the ship's motor [[whaleboat]] for Red Beach. When he arrived off the beach, the advance had not progressed far; [[sniper]]s were still active and the area was under sporadic mortar fire. The whaleboat grounded in knee-deep water. MacArthur requested a landing craft but the beachmaster was too busy to grant his request, so MacArthur waded ashore.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=552<U+2013>556.}}</ref> As he got ready to make his prepared speech, it started to rain. He said:{{quote|People of the Philippines: I have returned. By the grace of Almighty God our forces stand again on Philippine soil &mdash; soil consecrated in the blood of our two peoples. We have come dedicated and committed to the task of destroying every vestige of enemy control over your daily lives, and of restoring upon a foundation of indestructible strength, the liberties of your people.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=216.}}</ref>}}

[[File:Leyte beachhead.jpg|thumb|right|200px|General Douglas MacArthur (center), accompanied by Lieutenant Generals George C. Kenney and Richard K. Sutherland and Major General Verne D. Mudge (Commanding General, First Cavalry Division), inspecting the beachhead on Leyte Island, 20 October 1944. Note the crowd of onlookers.]]
Since Leyte was out of range of Kenney's land based aircraft, MacArthur was entirely dependent on carrier-based aircraft for air cover.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=228.}}</ref> Japanese air activity soon increased, with raids on [[Tacloban]], where MacArthur decided to establish his headquarters, and on the fleet offshore. MacArthur enjoyed staying on {{USS|Nashville|CL-43|2}}'s bridge during air raids, although several bombs landed close by, and the two nearby cruisers were hit,<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=561<U+2013>562.}}</ref> {{USS|Honolulu|CL-48|6}} by a [[torpedo]] and {{HMAS|Australia|D84|6}} by a [[kamikaze]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2australia.gov.au/waratsea/kamikaze.html|title=Australia's War 1939<U+2013>1945|work=Kamikaze|publisher=Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs|accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref> Over the next few days, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] staged a major counterattack in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. The Japanese carriers lured Halsey's Third Fleet away, while their battleships and cruisers converged on Kinkaid's Seventh Fleet. Kinkaid dealt with the southern prong of the attack in the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]], but due to "a series of fatal misunderstandings", Halsey left the [[San Bernardino Strait]] unguarded, resulting in the [[Battle off Samar]]. Had the Japanese battleships entered [[Leyte Gulf]], their guns could have destroyed the American transports and the supplies on the beaches, and isolated the troops ashore. Only heroic efforts by Rear Admiral [[Clifton Sprague]]'s [[escort carrier]]s, [[destroyers]] and [[destroyer escort]]s, and a premature decision to retire by Vice Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]], averted a disaster, which MacArthur attributed to command being divided between himself and Nimitz.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|pp=222<U+2013>231.}}</ref>  

Nor did the campaign ashore proceed smoothly. The timing of the assault so late in the year forced the combat troops, the pilots, and the supporting logistical units to contend with heavy [[monsoon]]al rains. During the first six weeks on Leyte, there were three [[typhoon]]s, and {{convert|35|in|mm}} of rain fell. This disrupted the program for airbase construction. Japanese aircraft made continual raids on Tacloban, destroying 27 aircraft in a single raid. MacArthur was forced to ask Nimitz to recall the carriers to support the Sixth Army. He also got Nimitz to lend some [[US Marine Corps]] [[night fighter]]s to help defend Tacloban. The carrier aircraft proved to be no substitute for the continual cover provided by land-based aircraft, and the lack of air cover permitted the Japanese Army to pour fresh troops into Leyte. The adverse weather and valiant Japanese resistance slowed the American advance ashore. In December, MacArthur landed the [[77th Sustainment Brigade (United States)|77th Infantry Division]] at [[Battle of Ormoc Bay|Ormoc Bay]], shutting the "back door" to Leyte.<ref name="MacArthur, p. 231">{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|pp=231<U+2013>234.}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=568<U+2013>569.}}</ref> By the end of December, Krueger's headquarters estimated that 5,000 Japanese remained on Leyte, and on December 26 MacArthur issued a communiqu<U+00E9> announcing that "the campaign can now be regarded as closed except for minor mopping up." However, Eichelberger's [[Eighth United States Army|Eighth Army]] would kill more than 27,000 Japanese on Leyte between then and the end of the campaign May 1945.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=602<U+2013>603.}}</ref> On December 16, 1944, MacArthur was promoted to the new [[5 star rank]] of [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]]. MacArthur had a Filipino [[silversmith]] make the rank badges from American, Australian, Dutch and Filipino coins.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=590<U+2013>591.}}</ref>

====Luzon====
MacArthur's next move was the [[Battle of Mindoro|invasion of Mindoro]], where there were good potential airfield sites around the [[San Jose, Occidental Mindoro|San Jose]] area. Willoughby estimated, correctly as it turned out, that the island had only about 1,000 Japanese defenders. The problem this time was getting there. A parachute drop was considered, but the airfields on Leyte lacked the space to hold the required transport aircraft. Kinkaid balked at sending escort carriers into the restricted waters of the [[Sulu Sea]], and Kenney could not guarantee land based air cover. The operation was clearly hazardous, and MacArthur's staff talked him out of accompanying the invasion on the {{USS|Nashville|CL-43|2}}. As the invasion force entered the Sulu Sea, a ''kamikaze'' struck ''Nashville'', killing 133 people and wounding 190 more, including the task force commander, Brigadier General William C. Dunkel. The landings were made unopposed on December 15, 1944, and within two weeks Australian and American engineers had three airstrips in operation; but "not since [[Operation Shingle|Anzio]] had the navy experienced so much difficulty supporting an amphibious operation after the initial landing." The resupply convoys were repeatedly attacked by ''kamikaze'' aircraft and the on December 26<U+2013>27 a Japanese naval force attacked the area, sinking a destroyer and damaging other ships.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=604<U+2013>609.}}</ref>

The way was now clear for the [[Battle of Luzon|invasion of Luzon]]. This time, based on different interpretations of the same intelligence data, Willoughby's G-2 Section at GHQ estimated the strength of General [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]]'s forces on Luzon at 137,000, while that of Sixth Army estimated it at 234,000. The Sixth Army Brigadier General [[Clyde D. Eddleman]] attempted to lay out the reasons for the Sixth Army's assessment, but MacArthur's response was "Bunk!" He felt that even Willoughby's estimate was too high. "Audacity, calculated risk, and a clear strategic aim were MacArthur's attributes," and he was prepared to disregard the intelligence estimates. Unfortunately, all the estimates were too low: Yamashita had more than 287,000 troops on Luzon.<ref>{{harvnb|Drea|1992|pp=180<U+2013>187.}}</ref> This time MacArthur travelled on the {{USS|Boise|CL-47|6}}, watching as the ship was near-missed by a bomb and torpedoes fired by [[midget submarine]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=619<U+2013>620.}}</ref> The GHQ communiqu<U+00E9> read:"The decisive battle for the liberation of the Philippines and the control of the Southwest pacific is at hand. General MacArthur is in personal command at the front and landed with his assault troops."<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|p=622.}}</ref> 

MacArthur's primary concern was the capture of the port of Manila and the airbase at [[Clark Air Base|Clark Field]], which were required to support future operations. MacArthur urged his front line commanders on.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|p=629.}}</ref> On January 25, 1945 he moved his advanced headquarters forward to [[Hacienda Luisita]], closer to the front than Krueger's at [[Calasiao, Pangasinan|Calasiao]].<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|p=623.}}</ref> on January 30, MacArthur ordered the 1st Cavalry Division's commander, Major General Vern D. Mudge, to conduct a rapid advance on Manila. On 3 February, they reached the northern outskirts of Manila and the campus of the [[University of Santo Tomas]] which had been turned into an [[internment camp]], liberating some 3,700 internees. They also captured the Malaca<U+00F1>ang Palace.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=632<U+2013>633.}}</ref> Unknown to the Americans, Rear Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi decided to defend Manila to the death. The

Although MacArthur had no specific directive from the Joint Chiefs to do so, and the fighting on Luzon was far from over, he committed the Eighth Army, Seventh Fleet and [[Thirteenth Air Force]] to a series of operations to liberate the remainder of the Philippines from the Japanese. A series of 52 amphibious landings were made in the central and southern Philippines between February and July 1945.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=737-741}}</ref> In the GHQ communiqu<U+00E9> on July 5, MacArthur announced the that the Philippines had now been liberated and all operations ended, although Yamashita still held out in northern Luzon.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|p=749}}</ref> Starting in May 1945, MacArthur used his Australian troops in the [[Borneo campaign (1945)|invasion of Borneo]]. MacArthur accompanied the [[Battle of North Borneo|assault on Labuan]] on {{USS|Boise|CL-47|2}}, and visited the troops ashore, along with Lieutenant General Sir [[Leslie Morshead]] and [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[William Bostock]]. En route back to his headquarters in Manila, he visited [[Davao]], where he told Eichelberger that no more than 4,000 Japanese remained alive on Mindanao. A few months later, six times that number would surrender. In July 1945, he set out in {{USS|Boise|CL-47|2}} once more to be with the Australian 7th Division for the [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|landing at Balikpapan]].<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=757-761}}</ref> MacArthur was awarded his fourth Distinguished Service Medal.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=260}}</ref> 

In April 1945, MacArthur became commander in chief U.S. Army Forces Pacific (AFPAC), in charge of all Army and Army Air Force units in the Pacific, except the [[Twentieth Air Force]]. At the same time, Nimitz became commander of all naval forces. Command therefore remained divided. GHQ became AFPAC headquarters in addition to SWPA. MacArthur created two new commands, AFMIDPAC under Richardson, and AFWESPAC under Lieutenant General [[Wilhelm D. Styer]], which absorbed [[USASOS]] and USAFFE.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=725-726}}</ref> This reorganization, which took some months to actually accomplish, was part of preparations for [[Operation Downfall]], the invasion of Japan. The first phase, the invasion of [[Kyushu]], known as Operation Olympic, was scheduled to commence on November 1, 1945.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=765-771}}</ref> The invasion was pre-empted by the [[surrender of Japan]] in August 1945. On September 2, MacArthur accepted the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|formal Japanese surrender]] aboard {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}, thus ending World War II.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=786-792}}</ref> In recognition of his role as a maritime strategist, the U.S. Navy awarded him the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]].<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=265}}</ref>

==Occupation of Japan==
{{Main|Occupation of Japan}}
MacArthur was ordered on August 29, 1945 to exercise authority through the Japanese government machinery, including Emperor [[Hirohito]].<ref>{{Harvnb|James|1975|pp=782<U+2013>783.}}</ref> MacArthur as [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] in Japan (SCAP) and his GHQ staff helped a devastated Japan rebuild itself, institute a democratic government, and chart a course that made Japan one of the world's leading industrial powers. The U.S. was firmly in control of Japan to oversee its reconstruction, and MacArthur was effectively the interim leader of Japan from 1945 until 1948.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=39<U+2013>139.}}</ref>  

[[File:macarthur hirohito.jpg|thumb|right|200px|General MacArthur and Emperor [[Hirohito]]]] 
In 1946, MacArthur's staff drafted a new [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] that renounced war and stripped the Emperor of his military authority. The constitution, which became effective on May 3, 1947, instituted a [[Westminster system]] form of government, under which the Emperor acted only on the advice of his ministers.  Included was the famous Article 9, which outlawed belligerency as an instrument of state policy and the maintenance of a standing army. The constitution also enfranchised women, guaranteed fundamental human rights, outlawed racial discrimination, strengthened the powers of Parliament and the Cabinet, and decentralized the police and local government.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=119<U+2013>139.}}</ref> 

A major [[land reform]] was also conducted, led by [[Wolf Ladejinsky]] of General Douglas MacArthur's SCAP staff. Between 1947 and 1949, approximately {{convert|4700000|acre|ha}}, or approximately 38% of Japan's cultivated land was purchased from the landlords under the government's reform program, and {{convert|4600000|acre|ha}} had been resold to the farmers who worked them. By 1950, 89% of all agricultural land was owner-operated and only 11% was tenant-operated.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=183<U+2013>192.}}</ref>  

During the Occupation, SCAP successfully, if not entirely, abolished many of the financial coalitions known as the [[Zaibatsu]], which had previously monopolized industry.<ref>{{harvnb|Schaller|1985|p=25.}}</ref> Along with the later American change of heart due in part to the need for an economically stronger Japan in the face of a perceived Soviet threat, these economic reforms were also hampered by the wealthy and influential Japanese who obviously stood to lose a great deal. As such, there were those who consequently resisted any attempts at reform, claiming that the Zaibatsu were required in order for Japan to compete internationally, and looser industrial groupings known as [[Keiretsu]] evolved. These reconstruction plans alarmed many in the United States Department of Defense and State Departments, believing they conflicted with the prospect of Japan and its industrial capacity as a bulwark against the spread of communism in Asia.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=222<U+2013>224, 252<U+2013>254.}}</ref> MacArthur's efforts to encourage [[trade union]] membership met with phenomenal success, and by 1947, 48% of the non-agricultural workforce was unionized. Some of MacArthur's reforms were rescinded in 1948 when his unilateral control of Japan was ended by the increased involvement of the State Department.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=174<U+2013>183.}}</ref>   

In an address to Congress on April 19, 1951, MacArthur declared: 
{{quote|The Japanese people since the war have undergone the greatest reformation recorded in modern history. With a commendable will, eagerness to learn, and marked capacity to understand, they have from the ashes left in war<U+2019>s wake erected in Japan an edifice dedicated to the supremacy of individual liberty and personal dignity, and in the ensuing process there has been created a truly representative government committed to the advance of political morality, freedom of economic enterprise, and social justice.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.koreanwar-educator.org/topics/brief/p_macarthur_speech.htm |title=General Douglas MacArthur's Address to Congress of the United States April 19, 1951|publisher=Korean War Educator|accessdate=March 23, 2010}}</ref>}}

MacArthur continued his habit of reading military history and biography.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|p=364.}}</ref> By 1950, the only remaining members of the old "Bataan Gang" were Willoughby, Marquat and Huff. From January 1949, his Chief of Staff was [[Edward Almond]]; other notable officers at SCAP were [[Far East Air Force (United States)|Far East Air Force]] commander Lieutenant General [[George E. Stratemeyer]]; Brigadier General [[Courtney Whitney]], Deputy Chiefs of Staff Major General [[Doyle Overton Hickey|Doyle O. Hickey]] and Lieutenant General [[Alonzo Patrick Fox|Alonzo P. Fox]]; and Captain [[Alexander Haig]].<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=380<U+2013>384.}}</ref> MacArthur handed over power to the Japanese government in 1949 but remained in Japan until relieved by President Truman on April 11, 1951. The [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]], signed on September 8, 1951, marked the end of the Allied occupation, and when it went into effect on April 28, 1952, Japan was once again an independent state.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=336<U+2013>354.}}</ref>

MacArthur was responsible for confirming and enforcing the sentences for [[war crime]]s handed down by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]].<ref name="MacArthur, pp. 318-319">{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|pp=318<U+2013>319.}}</ref> In late 1945, Allied military commissions in various cities of the Orient tried 5,700 Japanese, Taiwanese and Koreans for war crimes. About 4,300 were convicted, almost 1,000 sentenced to death, and hundreds given life imprisonment. The charges arose from incidents that included the [[Rape of Nanking]], the [[Bataan Death March]] and [[Manila massacre|the sack of Manila]].<ref>{{harvnb|Drea|Bradsher|Hanyok|Lide|Petersen|Yang|2006|p=7.}}</ref>

However, some historians criticize his work to exonerate Emperor [[Hirohito]] and all members of the imperial family implicated in the war (including Princes [[Prince Chichibu|Chichibu]], [[Prince Asaka Yasuhiko|Asaka]], [[Prince Takeda Tsuneyoshi|Takeda]], [[Prince Higashikuni Naruhiko|Higashikuni]] and [[Hiroyasu Fushimi|Fushimi]]) from criminal prosecutions. As early as November 26, 1945, MacArthur confirmed to admiral [[Mitsumasa Yonai]] that the emperor's abdication would not be necessary.<ref>{{harvnb|Dower|1999|p=323.}}</ref> MacArthur exonerated Hirohito and ignored the advice of many members of the imperial family and Japanese intellectuals who publicly asked for the abdication of the Emperor and the implementation of a regency. For example, [[Prince Mikasa]] (Takahito), Hirohito's youngest brother, even stood up in a meeting of the Privy Council, in February 1946, and urged his brother to take responsibility for defeat while the well-known poet [[Tatsuji Miyoshi]] wrote an essay in the magazine ''Shinch<U+00F4>'' titled "The Emperor should abdicate quickly."<ref>{{harvnb|Dower|1999|pp=321<U+2013>322.}}</ref> According to Herbert Bix, "months before the [[Tokyo tribunal]] commenced, MacArthur's highest subordinates were working to attribute ultimate responsibility for Pearl Harbor to [[Hideki Tojo]]"<ref>{{harvnb|Bix|2000|p=585.}}</ref> Bix argues that "immediately on landing in Japan, Bonner Fellers went to work to protect Hirohito from the role he had played during and at the end of the war" and "allowed the major war criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment."<ref name="Bix, p. 583">{{harvnb|Bix|2000|p=583.}}</ref> According to John Dower, "Hirohito was not merely presented as being innocent of any formal acts that might make him culpable to indictment as a war criminal. He was turned into an almost saintly figure who did not even bear moral responsibility for the war." "With the full support of MacArthur's headquarters, the prosecution functioned, in effect, as a defense team for the emperor."<ref name="Dower, p. 1999">{{harvnb|Dower|1999|p=326.}}</ref> 

As Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, MacArthur also gave immunity to [[Shiro Ishii]] and all members of the [[Unit 731|bacteriological research units]] in exchange for germ warfare data based on human experimentation. On  May 6, 1947, he wrote to Washington that "additional data, possibly some statements from Ishii probably can be obtained by informing Japanese involved that information will be retained in intelligence channels and will not be employed as 'War Crimes' evidence."<ref>{{harvnb|Gold|1966|p=109.}}</ref> The trial in Manila of General [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]], Japanese commander in the Philippines from 1944, was under MacArthur's direction and has been particularly criticized. Yamashita was hanged for the [[Manila massacre|massacre of Manila]] which he had not ordered and of which he was probably unaware. The massacre was ordered by Vice Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi who was nominally subordinate to General Yamashita.<ref>{{harvnb|Connaughton|Pimlott|Anderson|1997|pp=72<U+2013>73.}}</ref> Iwabuchi had killed himself as the battle for Manila was ending.<ref>{{harvnb|Manchester|1978|p=487.}}</ref>

==Korean War==
{{Main|Korean War}}
In 1945, as part of the surrender of Japan, the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] agreed to divide the [[Korean peninsula]] into two occupation zones at the [[38th parallel north]].<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=388-389.}}</ref> This resulted in the creation of two states: the western-aligned Republic of Korea (ROK) (usually referred to as [[South Korea]]) and the Soviet-aligned and [[Communism|Communist]] Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) (usually referred to as [[North Korea]]). Dr. [[Syngman Rhee]] was elected first [[President of South Korea]] and he invited MacArthur to attend the inauguration of the republic. MacArthur attended the occasion, which he called "a signal honor", promising Rhee if South Korea were attacked, he would "defend it as I would California." The occupying Soviet and American troops withdrew in 1948 and 1949 respectively, leaving behind military advisors.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=394-397.}}</ref>

[[File:IncheonLandingMcArthur.jpg|thumb|left|200px|MacArthur observes the naval shelling of Incheon from {{USS|Mount McKinley|AGC-7|6}}, September 15, 1950 with Brigadier General [[Courtney Whitney]] (left) and Major General [[Edward M. Almond]] (right).]]
On June 25, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, starting the [[Korean War]].<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|p=387.}}</ref> The [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 82]], which authorized a [[United Nations]] (UN) force to help South Korea. The Soviet Union failed to exercise its veto, as its delegates were boycotting sessions at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|p=434.}}</ref> The UN empowered the American government to select a commander of the UN forces, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously recommended MacArthur.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|p=436.}}</ref> He therefore became Commander in Chief of the United nations Command, which remaining SCAP in Japan and commander of the USAFFE. MacArthur's headquarters was located in the [[DN Tower 21|Dai Ichi Life Insurance Company Building]] in Tokyo, from which he and his successors directed operations in Korea.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|p=440.}}</ref> Rhee also placed all South Korean forces under MacArthur's command. As they retreated before the North Korean onslaught, MacArthur received permission to commit U.S. ground forces on July 1. All the first units to arrive could do was trade men and ground for time, falling back to the [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter|Pusan Perimeter]]. Lieutenant General [[Walton Walker]] established his Eighth Army headquarters at [[Taegu]] and assumed control of the perimeter.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=433-435.}}</ref> 

By the end of August, the crisis was subsiding. North Korean attacks on the perimeter had tapered off. While the North Korean force numbered 88,000 troops, Walker's forces now numbered 180,000, and he had more tanks and artillery pieces.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|p=451.}}</ref> In 1949, the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], General [[Omar Bradley]], had predicted that "large scale combined [[amphibious warfare|amphibious operations]]... will never occur again," but by July 1950, MacArthur was planning just such an operation.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|p=465.}}</ref> Meeting in Tokyo with Generals [[J. Lawton Collins]] and [[Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr.]] and Admirals [[Forrest Sherman]] and [[Arthur W. Radford]], MacArthur compared his plan with that of General [[James Wolfe]] at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]], and brushed aside the problems of tides, [[hydrography]] and terrain.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=467-469.}}</ref> In September, despite lingering concerns from superiors, MacArthur's soldiers and marines made a daring and successful [[Battle of Incheon|landing at Incheon]], deep behind North Korean lines. Launched with naval and close air support, the daring landing outflanked the North Koreans, recaptured [[Seoul]] and forced them to retreat northward in disarray.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=475-483.}}</ref> Visiting the battlefield on September 17, MacArthur surveyed six [[T-34]] tanks that had been knocked out by the marines, ignoring sniper fire around him, except to note that the North Korean marksmen were poorly trained.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|1989|pp=78-80.}}</ref>

On September 11, President Harry Truman issued orders for an advance beyond the 38th parallel into North Korea. In the wake of the victory at Inchon, the first South Korean troops advanced across the 38th parallel on October 1. MacArthur now planned another amphibious assault, on [[Wonsan]] on the east coast, but it fell to South Korean troops before the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] could reach it by ship. On September 25, the Chinese foreign minister, [[Zhou Enlai]], issued warnings via [[India]]'s ambassador to the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Kavalam Madhava Panikkar]], that an advance to the Yalu would force China into the war. In early October, troops of the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) had begun crossing into North Korea.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=486-493.}}</ref> In October, MacArthur [[Wake Island Conference|met with Truman on Wake Island]], where the president awarded MacArthur his fifth Distinguished Service Medal.<ref>{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|pp=360-363.}}</ref> Briefly questioned about the Chinese threat by President Truman, MacArthur dismissed it, saying that he hoped to be able to withdraw the Eighth Army to Japan by Christmas, and to release the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] for service in Europe in January. He regarded the possibility of Russian intervention as a more serious threat.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=507-508.}}</ref> 

A month later, things had changed. MacArthur flew to Walker's headquarters on November 24. MacArthur later wrote:{{quote|For five hours I toured the front lines. In talking to a group of officers I told them of General Bradley's desire and hope to have two divisions home by Christmas... What I had seen at the front line worried me greatly. The R.O.K. troops were not yet in good shape, and the entire line was deplorably weak in numbers. If the Chinese were actually in heavy force, I decided I would withdraw our troops and abandon any attempt to move north. I decided to reconoiter and try to see with my own eyes, and interpret with my own long experience what was going on...<ref name="MacArthur, pp. 372-373"/>}} MacArthur flew over the front line himself in his [[C-54]] but saw no signs of a Chinese build up. He therefore decided to wait ordering an advance or withdrawal. He was however, awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and honorary [[United States Aviator Badge|combat pilot's wings]].<ref name="MacArthur, pp. 372-373">{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|pp=372-373.}}</ref>

Walker's Eighth Army was attacked by the Chinese on November 25, 1950. Soon the UN forces were in retreat. MacArthur provided Collins with a series of nine successive withdrawal lines.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=537-538.}}</ref> On December 23, Walker was killed when his [[jeep]] collided with a truck. He was replaced by Lieutenant General [[Matthew B. Ridgway]], an officer Collins and MacArthur had already selected in case of such an eventuality.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|p=545.}}</ref> Ridgway noted that MacArthur's "prestige, which had gained an extraordinary luster after Inchon, was badly tarnished. His credibility suffered in the unforeseen outcome of the November offensive..."<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|p=559.}}</ref>

===Dismissal===
{{Main|Dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur}}
[[File:Truman-fires-mcarthur-49 04.gif|thumb|President Harry S. Truman's draft order terminating MacArthur as Supreme Commander, Allied Powers, Commander in Chief, Far East; and Commanding General, U.S. Army, Far East.]]
In February, the Eighth Army pressed north again, inflicting heavy casualties and recapturing Seoul in March 1951, Allied leaders had to once more consider whether they wanted MacArthur to invade North Korea or seek a peace. On March 24 MacArthur called on China to admit that it had been defeated, simultaneously challenging both the Chinese and his own superiors. Then on April 5, [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Joseph William Martin, Jr.]], the [[Minority leader of the United States House of Representatives]], released copies of a letter from MacArthur critical of President Truman's limited-war strategy to the press and read it aloud on the floor of the house.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=584<U+2013>589.}}</ref> The letter concluded with:
{{quote|It seems strangely difficult for some to realize that here in Asia is where the Communist conspirators have elected to make their play for global conquest, and that we have joined the issue thus raised on the battlefield; that here we fight Europe<U+2019>s war with arms while the diplomats there still fight it with words; that if we lose the war to communism in Asia the fall of Europe is inevitable, win it and Europe most probably would avoid war and yet preserve freedom. As you pointed out, we must win. There is no substitute for victory.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|p=590.}}</ref>}}

That day too, the Joint Chiefs of Staff drafted orders for MacArthur authorizing him to attack airbases in [[Manchuria]] and [[Shantung]] with [[nuclear weapons]] if Chinese air strikes originated from there.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|p=591.}}</ref> The next day, April 6, Truman summoned [[Secretary of Defense]] George Marshall, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Omar Bradley, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Dean Acheson]] and [[Averill Harriman]] to discuss what to do about MacArthur. The two generals were opposed to the idea of MacArthur's relief but Acheson was strongly in favor. The Joint Chiefs met on April 8 and agreed that MacArthur was not guilty of insubordination and had stretched but not violated any orders. They decided not to recommend MacArthur's relief. The next day Truman ordered MacArthur's relief by Ridgway. Lieutenant General [[James Van Fleet]] would assume command of the Eighth Army. The order went out on April 10 with Bradley's signature.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=591<U+2013>597.}}</ref> The relief led to a storm of controversy.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=607<U+2013>608.}}</ref> The war would go on until ended by the [[s:Korean Armistice Agreement|Armistice Agreement]] in July 1953.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|p=584.}}</ref>

==Later life==
[[File:Macarthurmemorial.JPG|thumb|200px|right|MacArthur Memorial in Norfolk]]
MacArthur flew to Washington, D.C. with his family via Hawaii. It was his and Jean's first visit to the continental United States since 1937, the visit during which they had been married; Arthur IV, now aged 13, had never been to the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|p=611}}</ref> MacArthur made his last official appearance in a farewell address to the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]]. This address, "one of the most impressive and divisive oratorical performances of recent American times," was interrupted by fifty ovations.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|p=613}}</ref> MacArthur ended the address saying: 
{{quote|I am closing my 52 years of military service. When I joined the Army, even before the turn of the century, it was the fulfillment of all of my boyish hopes and dreams. The world has turned over many times since I took the oath on the plain at West Point, and the hopes and dreams have long since vanished, but I still remember the refrain of one of the most popular barrack ballads of that day which proclaimed most proudly that "old soldiers never die; they just fade away."

And like the old soldier of that ballad, I now close my military career and just fade away, an old soldier who tried to do his duty as God gave him the light to see that duty.

Good Bye.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/douglasmacarthurfarewelladdress.htm |title=General Douglas MacArthur Farewell Address to Congress |accessdate=March 13, 2010}}</ref>}}

MacArthur encountered massive public adulation, which aroused expectations that he would run for the presidency as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1952|1952 election]]. However, a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] Committee investigation of his removal chaired by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Richard Brevard Russell, Jr.|Richard Russell]], largely vindicated the actions taken by President Truman, and contributed to a marked cooling of the public mood.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=621<U+2013>640}}</ref> [[Henry Luce]], the publisher of [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]], and a staunch supporter of MacArthur, wanted to make MacArthur [[Time Person of the Year|Time<U+2019>s Man of the Year]] for 1951, but was talked out of it by his editors.<ref>{{harvnb|Herzstein|2005|p=136}}</ref>

MacArthur repeatedly stated he had no political aspirations. In the 1952 Republican presidential nomination contest, MacArthur was not a candidate and instead endorsed Senator [[Robert Taft]] of Ohio. Rumors were rife Taft offered the vice presidential nomination to MacArthur. Taft did persuade MacArthur to be the keynote speaker at the [[1952 Republican National Convention]]. The speech was not well received. Taft lost the nomination to Eisenhower, MacArthur was silent during the campaign, which Eisenhower won by a landslide.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=648<U+2013>652}}</ref> Once elected, Eisenhower consulted with MacArthur and adopted his suggestion of threatening the use of nuclear weapons to end the war.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=653<U+2013>655}}</ref>

[[File:macarthurjustfadeaway.ogg|thumb|left|Closing words of MacArthur's final address to a joint session of Congress]]
MacArthur and Jean spent the last years of their life together in the penthouse of the Waldorf Towers, a part of the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]].<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=655<U+2013>656}}</ref> MacArthur was elected [[chairman of the board]] of [[Remington Rand]], a corporation which had annual sales of over $1.1 billion in 1961. In that year MacArthur earned a salary of $68,000, in addition to $20,000 pay and allowances as a general of the army.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=661<U+2013>662}}</ref> The Waldorf became the setting for an annual birthday party on January 26, thrown by the general's former deputy chief engineer, Major General [[Leif J. Sverdrup]]. At the 1960 celebration for MacArthur's 80th, many of his friends were startled by the general's obviously deteriorating health. The next day he collapsed and was rushed into surgery at [[St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center|St. Luke's Hospital]] to control a severely swollen [[prostate]].<ref name="Perret, pp. 581-583">{{harvnb|Perret|1996|pp=581<U+2013>583}}</ref>

After his recovery, MacArthur methodically began to carry out the closing act of his life. He visited the [[White House]] for a final reunion with [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]. In 1961, he made a "sentimental journey" to the Philippines, where he was decorated by President [[Carlos P. Garcia]] with the [[Philippine Legion of Honor]], rank of Chief Commander. MacArthur also accepted a $900,000 advance from [[Henry Luce]] for the rights to his memoirs, and began writing the volume that would eventually be published as ''Reminiscences''.<ref name="Perret, pp. 581-583"/> They began to appear in serialized form in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine in the months just prior to his death.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=684<U+2013>685}}</ref> 

President [[John F. Kennedy]] solicited MacArthur's counsel in 1961. The first of two meetings was shortly after the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]]. MacArthur was extremely critical of [[United States Department of Defense|the Pentagon]] and its military advice to Kennedy. MacArthur also cautioned the young President to avoid a U.S. military build-up in [[Vietnam]], pointing out domestic problems should be given a much greater priority.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|pp=681<U+2013>682}}</ref> Shortly before his death, he gave similar advice to the new President, [[Lyndon Johnson]].<ref>{{harvnb|James|1985|p=687}}</ref>

In 1962, West Point honored the increasingly frail MacArthur with the [[Sylvanus Thayer Award]] for outstanding service to the nation, which had gone to Eisenhower the year before. MacArthur's speech to the cadets in accepting the award had as its theme ''Duty, Honor, Country:'' {{quote|The shadows are lengthening for me. The twilight is here. My days of old have vanished, tone and tint. They have gone glimmering through the dreams of things that were. Their memory is one of wondrous beauty, watered by tears, and coaxed and caressed by the smiles of yesterday. I listen vainly, but with thirsty ears, for the witching melody of faint bugles blowing reveille, of far drums beating the long roll. In my dreams I hear again the crash of guns, the rattle of musketry, the strange, mournful mutter of the battlefield. But in the evening of my memory, always I come back to West Point. Always there echoes and re-echoes: Duty, Honor, Country. Today marks my final roll call with you, but I want you to know that when I cross the river my last conscious thoughts will be of The Corps, and The Corps, and The Corps. I bid you farewell."<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.west-point.org/real/ |accessdate=March 14, 2010 |title=MacArthur's Sylvanus Thayer Award acceptance speech at West Point, 1962}}</ref>}}

[[File:Macarthurtomb.JPG|thumb|right|200px|MacArthur's sarcophagus at the MacArthur Memorial in Norfolk]]
MacArthur died at [[Walter Reed Army Hospital]] on April 5, 1964, of [[biliary cirrhosis]].<ref>{{harvnb|Perret|1996|p=585}}</ref> President Kennedy had authorized a State Funeral, and President Johnson confirmed the directive when he ordered that General MacArthur be buried "with all the honor a grateful nation can bestow on a departed hero."<ref>{{harvnb|Mossman|Stark|1991|p=216}}</ref> On 7 April General MacArthur's body was moved to the 7th Regiment Armory, where it lay in the Clark Room throughout the day. A relief of the guard of honor was posted. Later in the morning Jean and the family group arrived at the armory for a private interfaith memorial service.<ref>{{harvnb|Mossman|Stark|1991|p=218}}</ref> The body was taken on a funeral train carrying the President to [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] and then was transported by a funeral procession to the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]],<ref>{{harvnb|Mossman|Stark|1991|pp=225<U+2013>231}}</ref> where it lay in state. An estimated 150,000 people filed by the bier.<ref>{{harvnb|Mossman|Stark|1991|p=236}}</ref> On April 11, the body was taken to [[Washington National Airport]] and flown to [[Naval Station Norfolk]]. It was finally laid to rest in the rotunda of The MacArthur Memorial.<ref>{{harvnb|Mossman|Stark|1991|pp=236<U+2013>253}}</ref>

In 1960 the mayor of [[Norfolk, Virginia]] had proposed, using funds raised by public contribution, to remodel the old Norfolk courthouse as a memorial to General MacArthur and as a repository for his papers, decorations, and mementos. General MacArthur accepted. Although he had no other ties with the state, his mother was a Virginian, born in Norfolk. Restored and remodeled, the building contains nine museum galleries whose contents reflect the general's fifty years of military service. At the heart of the memorial is a rotunda. In its center lies a sunken circular crypt with two marble sarcophagi, one for General MacArthur, the other for Jean,<ref>{{harvnb|Mossman|Stark|1991|p=253}}</ref> who continued to live in the Waldorf Towers until her own death in 2000.<ref name=macarthurmemorial>{{citation |accessdate=March 1, 2010 |url=http://www.macarthurmemorial.org/ |title=The MacArthur Memorial |location=Norfolk, Virginia}}</ref>
