'''Andr<U+00E9>s Mauricio Cabas''', or just '''Cabas''' (born [[October 7|7 October]] [[1977]]) is a [[Colombia|Colombian]] musician.  His music has become popular, perhaps due to his catchy and Caribbean sounding songs.

==Biography==

Cabas was born in [[Barranquilla]], [[Colombia]]. His father Eduardo, a musician and composer himself, taught Cabas music from the age of five. At six, Cabas formally studied [[piano]] and became skilled at this and various other instruments, including [[percussion]]. Through his teenage years, he acquired a taste for [[European classical music|classical music]], [[rock and roll]], [[electronic music]] and also for his native [[cumbia]] and [[fandango]] music.

As a young adult, Cabas travelled. He first visited [[Paris]] and later [[New York]]; it was in New York's nighclubs that he met prominent figures of [[jazz]] and [[Salsa music|salsa]], inspiring him to write and compose music. Perhaps paradoxically, New York was also an unhappy phase in Cabas' life, where he felt alienated and depressed<ref> Cabas.com ''[http://www.cabasmusic.com/portal/hgxpp001.aspx?26,1,8,O,E,0,MNU;E;1;2;MNU;, Cabas: Biography]''. Retrieved August 23, 2006.</ref>. The period resulted in his self-titled album, ''Cabas'', in [[2000]] which became a huge success in Colombia.  His single ''Mi Bomb<U+00F3>n'' (''My Bombon'') topped the country's charts for three consecutive months, earning him a Gold Disc and a double Platinum disc.

To consolidate this success, Cabas toured [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Ecuador]] in 2001.

In [[2002]], Cabas began to promote his music in other parts of [[Latin America]] and the [[United States]], receiving a good reception from critics <ref> Los40.com ''[http://los40.com.co/artista.asp?id=9047, Biographies'']. Retrieved August 23, 2006. ''"A national as well as international tour also marked Cabas' story, for in less than a month he visited the main cities of Colombia, as well as Quito and Guayaquil in Ecuador and Caracas in Venezuela, obtaining the best response from the public and the media, so much that after releasing his first record there were already fan clubs in each of these countries. In 2002, Cabas assumed the challenge of officially presenting his record in the United States, Mexico, Chile, Spain, Argentina and Puerto Rico, becoming in a phenomenon of extraordinary proportions for the international critics."''</ref> and an article in the [[Billboard magazine]] <ref> ElUniversal.com ''[http://www.eluniversal.com/estampas/anteriores/021103/protagonistas.shtml, El Mestizaje de Cabas]''. Retrieved August 23, 2006. ''"His first record, ''Cabas'', hasn't had a bad time at all. The ''Angeles Times'' gave it five stars and the Billboard magazine described it as a new musical revelation, and the main representant of "pornopop"."'' </ref>. He performed his first concert in the United States in late 2002. Cabas performed with artists such as [[Lenny Kravitz]] in [[Mexico]], and [[Shakira]] and [[Miguel Bos<U+00E9>]] in [[Spain]].

In [[2003]], his second album ''Contacto'' (''Contact'') could be said to define his style. ''Contact'' mixed percussion and [[drums]] with [[bass guitar|bass]] and rock beats, and the first single, ''La Caderona'' (''The Big-hipped woman'') had similar success to ''Mi Bomb<U+00F3>n''. Cabas' first [[music video]], from the song ''Leche'' (''Milk''), premiered on [[MTV Networks Latin America|MTV Latin America]]. Other singles such as ''Bolita de Trapo'' (''Little rug Ball'') also topped the charts in Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador. After this success, Cabas decided to launch a [[France|French]] tour.

His participation in a tribute concert to the musician [[Carlos Santana]] increased his exposure. Cabas won the [[Latin Grammy Award]] for ''Best New Artist'', a celebration in which he became notorious for simply walking to the awards instead of taking a limousine <ref> ElUniversal.com ''[http://www.eluniversal.com/estampas/anteriores/021103/protagonistas.shtml, El Mestizaje de Cabas]''. Retrieved August 23, 2006. ''"While all nominated artists arrived in limousines to the past Latin Grammy awards of 2002, he [Cabas] walked to the meeting place."'' </ref> the [[MTV Video Music Awards Latin America|MTV Latin Awards]] for ''Best Rock Album'' and ''Best Rock Interpretation'', and the ''People's Prize'' and ''Best Rock Video'' in the [[Lo Nuestro Awards]].

In [[2005]], Cabas recorded his third album, ''Puro Cabas'' (''Pure Cabas''), in [[El Cielo Recording Studios]], [[Monterrey]], Mexico, with the support of famous Colombian composer [[Kike Santander]], musician [[Sargento Garc<U+00ED>a]], and producers [[Toy Hernandez]] and [[Sacha Triujeque]]. ''Puro Cabas'' proved to be another huge success. Cabas' first single, ''La Cadena de Oro'' (''The Gold Locket''), was a major hit in Latin America, along with its music video that stayed in MTV's top ten for some time. This hit was followed immediately by his second single, ''Incre<U+00ED>ble'' (''Incredible''), and performances in various Latin American music festivals. ''Puro Cabas'' itself was one of the twenty best selling latin albums of [[2005]] according to [[iTunes]] <ref> Ticias.com ''[http://www.ticias.com/archives/2006/01/18/10066/%e2%80%9cpuro-cabas%e2%80%9d-entre-los-20-mejores-albumes-latinos-de-itunes-en-el-2005/, "''Pure Cabas''" amongst the 20 best 2005 latin albums of iTunes]''. Retrieved August 23, 2006.</ref>

In 2006, Cabas started to compose a series of 37 children songs commissioned by the Swiss-based ZERI Foundation. This was perhaps the greatest challenge ever for Cabas' creative mind. However, by September he completed the task and successfully recorded under the guidance of his father Eduardo songs in different styles that bring a positive message to children. The title song "Yo Quiero Vivir en Un Mundo Mejor" (I Want To Live in a Better World) is a sing along that immediately catches the imagination of the children. These songs accompany 36 fables which have been written by Gunter Pauli, the Belgian economist turned scientist who is dedicated to exposing kids to over 1,000 academic subjects without any jargon so that they can design solutions bringing water, food, housing, health, energy, jobs and education to all with what they have.  </ref> ZERI Foundation ''[http://www.zeri.org/initiative]'.' The DVD with all 37 songs and the 36 fables presented in English and Spanish will be released in January 2007.
