The '''list of North Carolina hurricanes''' includes 397&nbsp;[[tropical cyclone|tropical]] or [[subtropical cyclone]]s that have affected the [[U.S. state]] of [[North Carolina]]. Due to its location, many hurricanes have hit the state directly, and numerous hurricanes have passed near or through North Carolina in its history; the state is ranked fourth, after [[Florida]], [[Texas]], and [[Louisiana]], in the number of cyclones that produced hurricane force winds in a U.S. state.<ref name="chron">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2008|title=Chronological List of All Hurricanes which Affected the Continental United States: 1851-2005|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2008-04-03|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/ushurrlist18512007.txt}}</ref><ref name="change">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2006|title=Documentation of Atlantic Tropical Cyclones Changes in HURDAT|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2008-01-31|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/metadata_master.html}}</ref> Hurricanes in North Carolina history are responsible for over $11&nbsp;billion in damage (2008&nbsp;USD) and almost 1,000&nbsp;total fatalities.

== Climatology ==
According to statistical hurricane research between 1886 and 1996 by the North Carolina State Climatology Office, a tropical cyclone makes [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] along the coastline about once every four years. An estimated 17.5&nbsp;percent of all [[Atlantic hurricane|Atlantic]] tropical cyclones have affected the state.<ref name="ncclimate"/> Additionally, the remnants of a few [[Pacific hurricane|Pacific]] tropical cyclones impacted the state.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Roth|year=2008|title=Tropical Cyclone Rainfall for the Southeast|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|accessdate=2008-04-03|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/tcsoutheast.html}}</ref> [[Cape Hatteras]] is most affected by storms within the state, though [[Cape Lookout]] and [[Cape Fear]] are also regularly impacted; the increased activity in three areas is because it protrudes from elsewhere along the the Atlantic coastline.<ref name="ncclimate">{{cite web|author=State Climate Office of North Carolina|year=2006|title=Hurricanes in North Carolina|accessdate=2008-04-03|url=http://www.nc-climate.ncsu.edu/print/8}}</ref> After Southern Florida, Cape Hatteras has the lowest return period, or the frequency at which a certain intensity or category of hurricane can be expected within 86&nbsp;[[statute mile|mi]] (139&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) of a given location, in the country.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2006|title=Tropical Cyclone Climatology|accessdate=2007-10-02|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastprofile.shtml}}</ref> As the [[Outer Banks]] are a narrow strip of low-lying land, hurricanes occasionally leave portions of the land partially or fully submerged.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sprol.com|date=2005-09-15|title=When will a Category Five Hurricane strike the Outer Banks?|accessdate=2008-03-04|url=http://www.sprol.com/?p=259}}</ref> Additionally, the remnants of inland tropical cyclones have produced flooding and landslides in the state's western region.<ref name="0069rain">{{cite web|author=William Haggard, Thaddeus Bilton, and Harold Crutcher|publisher=Journal of Applied Meteorology|year=1973|title=Maximum Rainfall from Tropical Cyclone Stems which Cross the Appalachians|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-03-23|url=http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0450/12/1/pdf/i1520-0450-12-1-50.pdf}}</ref>

Tropical cyclones have affected North Carolina in every month between May and December; about 35&nbsp;percent of the storms impacted the state in September, and 80&nbsp;percent affected the state between August and October, which coincides with the peak of the hurricane season. The earliest storm to affect the state was [[Subtropical Storm Andrea (2007)|Subtropical Storm Andrea]] on [[May 7]], [[2007]], and the latest was a tropical storm that moved across the Outer Banks on [[December 2]], [[1925]]. The strongest storm to strike the state was [[Hurricane Hazel]] in 1954, which made landfall as a [[List of Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 4]] hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]].<ref name="hurdat">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2007|title=Atlantic hurricane best track|publisher=[[NOAA]]|accessdate=2008-04-03|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/easyhurdat_5107.html}}</ref>

== Pre-1900 ==

{{main|List of North Carolina hurricanes (pre&ndash;1900)}}
The list of North Carolina hurricanes before 1900 encompasses 139&nbsp;[[tropical cyclone]]s that affected the [[U.S. state]] of [[North Carolina]]. Collectively, cyclones in North Carolina during the time period resulted in over 775&nbsp;direct fatalities during the period. Seven cyclones affected the state in the [[1893 Atlantic hurricane season|1893 season]], which was the year with the most tropical cyclones impacting the state during the time period. From the beginning of the official Atlantic hurricane record in 1851 to 1899, there were 12&nbsp;years without a known tropical cyclone affecting the state.

Historical data prior to 1700 is sparse due to lack of significant European settlements along the coastline; the few storms listed are largely records from [[Roanoke Colony]] and later the [[Province of Carolina]]. Modern meteorologists believe early storms were tropical cyclones, though due to the time period confirmation is impossible.<ref name="nc">{{cite web|author=James E.

The period from 1980 to the present<!--as of 2007--> encompasses 104&nbsp;[[tropical cyclone|tropical]] or [[subtropical cyclone]]s that affected the state. Collectively, cyclones in North Carolina during the time period resulted in over $10&nbsp;billion in damage (2007&nbsp;[[USD]]), primarily from hurricanes [[Hurricane Fran|Fran]] and [[Hurricane Floyd|Floyd]]. Additionally, tropical cyclones in North Carolina were responsible for 75&nbsp;direct fatalities and at least 44&nbsp;indirect casualties during the period. Eight cyclones affected the state in the [[1985 Atlantic hurricane season|1985 season]], which was the year with the most tropical cyclones impacting the state. Every year included at least one tropical cyclone affecting the state.<!--Data based on article-->

==Deadly storms==
The table lists hurricanes by death tolls of over 20&nbsp;fatalities. Direct deaths are those that are directly caused by the storm passage, such as drownings or deaths from being struck by windblown objects. Indirect deaths, which are included in the toll of Hurricane Floyd, are those that are related to the storm, but not directly from its storm effects. Due to lack of data, many early hurricanes have overall death tolls that do not specify indirect or death.
