'''Peter Phillip Bonetti''' (born [[27 September]] [[1941]] in [[Putney]], [[London]]) of Swiss parents (who had emigrated from the Alpine Lakes region of Italy) was a [[football (soccer)|football]] [[goalkeeper]] for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], the [[St. Louis Stars (soccer)|St. Louis Stars]], [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] and [[England national football team|England]]. Bonetti was known for his safe handling, lightning reflexes and his graceful style, for which he was given the [[nickname]], ''"The Cat"''. He was one of several goalkeepers ([[Gordon West]] of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] was another) who specialised in a one-armed throw which could achieve a similar distance to a drop kick. 

==Playing career==
===Chelsea===
Chelsea signed him from the [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] youth team after his mother had written to then-manager [[Ted Drake]], requesting that he give her son a trial. He made his first team  debut in 1960 and a few weeks later helped the Chelsea youth side win the [[FA Youth Cup]]. From the [[1960-61 in English football|1960-61]] season onwards, he was Chelsea's first choice goalkeeper, a position he held more or less constantly for the next nineteen years. Chelsea were relegated in Bonetti's second full season, which saw the appointment of [[Tommy Docherty]] as manager. Bonetti emerged as a key figure in a talented young side which included [[Bobby Tambling]], [[Terry Venables]], [[John Hollins]] and [[Barry Bridges]]. The team went into the penultimate match of the season needing to beat promotion rivals [[Sunderland AFC|Sunderland]] to have a chance of going up. Chelsea won 1-0, with Bonetti making a brilliant last minute save to deny [[George Mulhall]] and maintain his side's promotion chances; a 7-0 win over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] secured instant promotion back to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].

The new Chelsea side challenged for honours during the [[1960s]], with Bonetti a key figure throughout, although more often than not the team narrowly missed out. Chelsea won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in [[Football League Cup Final 1965|1965]] with a 3-2 [[aggregate score|aggregate]] victory over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. Leicester put Chelsea under heavy pressure in the second leg at [[Filbert Street]], but an inspired performance from Bonetti helped secure a 0-0 draw for his side and thus the trophy. For most of the same season, Chelsea were on course to add both the league title and the [[FA Cup]] but ultimately missed out. They were beaten by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the FA Cup while the title challenge was ended with a few games left after a bust-up between Docherty and several of his first-team players - though not Bonetti - meaning that a much-weakened team was fielded in a key match against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], in which Bonetti conceded six goals.

Bonetti played in every game of Chelsea's [[UEFA Cup|Fairs Cup]] run the following season, putting in a series of impressives displays against the likes of [[AS Roma]], [[AC Milan]] and [[FC Barcelona]], though the side were eventually knocked out in the semi-finals, as they were in the FA Cup for the second consecutive year. The signing of [[Alex Stepney]] at the end of that season briefly threatened his position as Chelsea's first choice goalkeeper and he considered putting in a [[Transfer (football)|transfer]] request, but Stepney ultimately played only one game for the club and was sold to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] a few months later. Chelsea eventually reached an FA Cup final in 1967, where they faced [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], but the team underperformed on the day and Bonetti could do little to stop Spurs winning 2-1.

That was the closest he came to winning another trophy with Chelsea until 1970, by which time Docherty had been succeeded by [[Dave Sexton]]. In 1970, Chelsea again reached the [[FA Cup Final 1970|FA Cup final]] and this time faced reigning league champions [[Leeds United AFC|Leeds United]]. Over the two fiercely contested games, Bonetti had what was perhaps the finest moment of his playing career. Chelsea were outplayed for large spells in the first final at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] and he made a series of crucial saves to help them emerge with a 2-2 draw. Shortly into the replay at [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]], his left knee was badly injured after a challenge from Leeds' [[Mick Jones (footballer)|Mick Jones]]. He returned to the field after treatment, but was effectively playing on one leg for the rest of the match and was powerless to stop Jones scoring the opener a few minutes later. In spite of the injury, and being targeted by the Leeds forwards, he made crucial saves throughout the match, denying both [[Peter Lorimer]] and [[Terry Cooper]], and resisted more pressure from Leeds after Chelsea had taken the lead in [[extra time]] to help secure a 2-1 win. Such were Bonetti's performances that season, he was voted runner-up in the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] awards.

A year later, the team added the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] after another replayed win in the final, this time over [[Spain|Spanish]] giants [[Real Madrid]] in [[Athens]]. Chelsea took a 2-0 lead in the replay, but Real dominated for much of the second half and it was another inspired performance from Bonetti, who had missed a large part of that season through injury, which helped them hold on for a 2-1 win.

That was his last trophy with the club, although they narrowly missed out on more in the following years, losing in the 1972 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and in the semi-finals of the same competition to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] a year later. Financial and disciplinary problems within the club prevented them from building on their success and Bonetti left on a [[free transfer (soccer)|free transfer]] in 1975, joining the [[St. Louis Stars (soccer)|St. Louis Stars]] of the [[North American Soccer League]] (NASL).  That year, he played 21 games for the side and helped them top the Central Division that summer and reach the play-off semi-finals. He then returned to Chelsea again, where his experience proved invaluable in helping new manager [[Eddie McCreadie]]'s young side gain promotion in [[1976-77 in English football|1976-77]]. Two years later, in May 1979, he played his final game for Chelsea, a 1-1 draw with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], having made a total of 729 appearances for the club in nineteen years - only [[Ron Harris (footballer)|Ron Harris]] has made more - and kept over 200 [[clean sheet]]s. He conceded one goal or less in two-thirds of his games for Chelsea.

===England===
Bonetti's international career was somewhat unfortunate. He emerged in an era of talented English goalkeepers and thus faced stiff competition for a place in the side, particularly from [[Ron Springett]] and [[Gordon Banks]], and later on [[Peter Shilton]], which limited him to just seven [[Cap (football)|caps]]. He was a member of England's successful [[FIFA World Cup 1966|1966 World Cup]] squad, but didn't make an appearance. His career with the England national side is also largely remembered for one match - the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] quarter-final against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in [[Mexico]], when he was thrust into the starting line-up as a late replacement for Banks, who was suffering from [[food poisoning]]. During the match England let slip a 2-0 lead and lost 3-2 after [[extra time]], with Bonetti one of the [[scapegoat]]s, although he could be reasonably faulted for only one of the three goals conceded. That game was his only World Cup appearance and his last for England. He conceded one goal in his other six international matches.

==Retirement==
After leaving Chelsea, Bonetti moved to the [[Isle of Mull]] where he became a [[Mail carrier|postman]]. While living in [[Scotland]], he briefly came out of retirement to play several games for [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] as understudy to [[Hamish McAlpine]]. Following his retirement from playing, Bonetti moved into coaching and had spells with Chelsea, [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and the England national side. At one time he held the record for the most appearances for a single club by a goalkeeper, but was overtaken in the [[1990s]] by [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]'s [[Alan Knight]].

Since 2005, Bonetti has made several appearances for an Old England XI in various charity games, notably against celebrity sides, usually coming on for the last 10 minutes of each game.
