A '''defective script''' is a [[writing system|script]] that does not represent all the [[phoneme|phonemic]] distinctions of a language. It is different from an irregular script, such as the [[English alphabet]], which ''can'' distinguish all the phonemes of the language even if in practice it does not always do so. 

For example, [[Italian language|Italian]] has seven [[vowel]]s, but the [[Italian alphabet]] has only five vowel [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s to represent them; in general, the differences between {{IPA|/e, <U+025B>/}} and {{IPA|/o, <U+0254>/}} are simply ignored. Among the [[consonant]]s, both /s/ and /z/ are written <nowiki><s></nowiki>, and both {{IPA|/ts/}} and {{IPA|/dz/}} are written <z>, though not many words are distinguished by the latter. [[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] is not reliably distinguished. 

Such imperfections are nothing new. The [[Greek alphabet]] has been defective for its entire history. [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] had distinctive [[long vowel|vowel length]]: five short vowels, {{IPA|/i e a o u/}}, and seven long vowels, {{IPA|/i<U+02D0> e<U+02D0> <U+025B><U+02D0> a<U+02D0> <U+0254><U+02D0> o<U+02D0> u<U+02D0>/}}. When the [[Phoenician alphabet]] was adapted to Greek, the names of five letters were pronounced with initial vowels by the Greeks and used acrophonically to represent vowels. These were ''[[alpha (letter)|alpha ]]'', ''e'' (later called ''[[epsilon (letter)|e psilon]]''), ''[[iota (letter)|iota ]]'', ''o'' (later called ''[[omicron (letter)|o micron]]'', and ''u'' (later called ''[[upsilon (letter)|u psilon]]''): five letters for twelve vowel sounds. Later the [h] dropped  from the Eastern Greek dialects, and the letter ''heta'' (now pronounced ''[[eta (letter)|eta]]'') became available; it was used for {{IPA|/<U+025B><U+02D0>/}}. About the same time the Greeks created an additional letter, ''[[omega (letter)|omega]]'', probably by writing ''omicron'' with an underline, that was used for {{IPA|/<U+0254><U+02D0>/}}. [[Digraph (orthography)|Digraph]]s ''ei'' and ''ou'' were devised for {{IPA|/e<U+02D0>/}} and {{IPA|/o<U+02D0>/.}} Thus Greek entered its classical era with seven letters and two digraphs for twelve vowel sounds. Long {{IPA|/i<U+02D0> a<U+02D0> u<U+02D0>/}} were never distinguished from short {{IPA|/i a u/}}, even though the distinction was meaningful. Although the Greek alphabet was a good match to the consonants of the language, it was defective when it came to the vowels. 

A famously defective alphabet is the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] one. The modern script does not normally write short vowels, but for the first few centuries of the [[Islam]]ic era, many consonant letters were ambiguous as well. The Arabic alphabet derives from the Aramaic, and not only did the [[Aramaic language]] have fewer [[phoneme]]s than Arabic, but several originally distinct Aramaic letters had conflated (become indistinguishable in shape), so that in the early Arabic writings 18 letters had to do duty for 28 consonant phonemes &mdash; and in the middle of words, only 15 were distinct. For example, medial <<U+FBE9>> represented /b, t, <U+03B8>, n, j/, and <<U+FEA1>> represented /g, <U+0127>, x/. A system of [[diacritic]] marks, or ''pointing,'' was later developed to resolve the ambiguities, and over the centuries became nearly universal. However, even today unpointed texts of a style called ''ma<U+0161>q'' are found, where these consonants are not distinguished. 

Without short vowels or [[Gemination|geminate]] consonants being written, modern Arabic <U+0646><U+0638><U+0631> ''{{unicode|n<U+1E93>r}}'' could represent {{IPA|/na<U+00F0><U+02E4>ara/}} 'he saw', {{IPA|/na<U+00F0><U+02E4><U+02D0>ara/}} 'he compared', {{IPA|/nu<U+00F0><U+02E4>ira/}} 'he was seen', {{IPA|/nu<U+00F0><U+02E4><U+02D0>ira/}} 'he was compared', {{IPA|/na<U+00F0><U+02E4>ar/}} 'a glance', or {{IPA|/ni<U+00F0><U+02E4>r/}} 'similar'. However, in practice there is little ambiguity, as the vowels are more easily predictable in Arabic than they are in a language like English. Moreover, the defective nature of the script has its benefits: the stable shape of the root words, despite grammatical [[inflection]], results in quicker word recognition and therefore faster reading speeds; {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and the lack of short vowels, the sounds which vary the most between [[Varieties of Arabic|Arabic dialects]], makes texts more widely accessible to a diverse audience. 

However, in ''ma<U+0161>q'' and those styles of ''[[kufic]]'' writing which lack consonant pointing, the ambiguities are more serious, for here different roots are written the same. <U+FBE8><U+0637><U+0631> could represent the root ''{{unicode|n<U+1E93>r}}'' 'see' as above, but also ''{{unicode|n<U+1E6D>r}}'' 'protect', ''{{unicode|b<U+1E6D>r}}'' 'pride', ''{{unicode|b<U+1E93>r}}'' 'clitoris' or 'with flint', as well as several inflections and derivations of each of these root words.
