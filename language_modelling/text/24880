The '''Tartan Army''' are travelling supporters of the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Scottish national football team|national football team]]. They were named the ''World's Friendliest Fans''  during the [[Football World Cup 1998|1998 World Cup]], and have won numerous awards over the years from both [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]] for their combination of rabid support and friendly nature. Footballing legend [[Pel<U+00E9>]] is even considered an honorary member as is tv entertainer [[Borat]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

This friendly attitude is all the more surprising bearing in mind their [[List of Scotland national football team results|team's track record]], which is often neatly summed up as ''glorious failure''. They have never progressed past the first round of the FIFA [[Football World Cup|World Cup]], although they did qualify for five in a row - from 1974-90.

Some say that the amicability of the Tartan Army is due to the large volumes of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] imbibed before, during and after a game (similar to their counterparts in the [[Green and white army]]), a fact that few members would dispute. Countries drawn against Scotland welcome the arrival of their fans.<ref>{{cite news | title = Tartan Army to Woo UEFA

Allegations have been made against the Tartan Army that they carry a strong [[Anglophobia|anti-English]] sentiment, often being open and highly vociferous in their support of [[England national football team|England]]'s opponents {{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Some TA members, however, assert that since there is nothing unusual in bitter rivals wishing to see one another defeated (a phenomenon occurring in other rivalries the world over) these matters should be seen purely in the context of good-natured sporting rivalry and not as [[xenophobia]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

The Tartan Army was originally used to refer to fans of the [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scottish Rugby Team]].

An attempt was made to trademark the phrase "Tartan Army", and indeed, several small scale producers of merchandise featuring the words "tartan army", have been threatened with legal action. However, any such action would likely not succeed due to each clause being suffixed with "but not including any such goods relating to Scottish football." in the trademark registration.
