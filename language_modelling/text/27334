==Biography==
Gui Youguang was born in [[Kunshan]], a county in the south-east of [[Jiangsu]] Provice. His family was a big family in the past but was falling into decay with each passing day at that time. When Gui was only 8 years old, his 25-year-old mother died, leaving her three sons and two daughters to her husband. After that, Gui's family lived a much harder life. Under this circumstance, Gui was obliged to learn about sorrow and suffering at a very early age. Because of his cleverness and hard work, Gui was able to write quite good articles when he was only 9 years old. At the age of 10, he wrote an article of several thousand words, called ''Qi Xi Lun''(<U+4E5E><U+91AF><U+8BBA>). Gui then took the local examination, Tongzi Shi(<U+7AE5><U+5B50><U+8BD5>), to be qualified to take a further examination to be an official of the Ming Dynasty. He came first in this examination when he was 20 years old. 

However, Gui didn't go smoothly in his later forty years. He went to [[Nanjing]] to take part in the further examinations for eight times but all failed. In 1565, Gui finally got a [[Jinshi]](<U+8FDB><U+58EB>)(the lowest title for participants who are accepted by examiners) in his ninth examination. So, Gui became a [[Zhixian]](<U+77E5><U+53BF>)(an official position) in [[Changxing]](<U+957F><U+5174>) at the age of sixty. Three years later, Gui was transferred to be a Tongpan in [[Shunde]](<U+987A><U+5FB7>). In 1570, after Gui went to Beijing to celebrate Wanshoujie(<U+4E07><U+5BFF><U+8282>)(the birthday of the emperor), he was promoted to be the Taipusi Sichen in Nanjing(<U+5357><U+4EAC><U+592A><U+4EC6><U+5BFA><U+5BFA><U+4E1E>)(an official position). But he still stayed in Beijing to compile a book called ''Shizong Shi Lu''(<U+4E16><U+5B97><U+5B9E><U+5F55>) for the emperor. When Gui was just about to show his talent to realize his dreams, he got seriously sick suddenly.

In 1571, Gui died in Beijing at the age of 66 because of the illness.<ref>{{zh icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.zh5000.com/ZHJD/ctwh/2007-09-22/1605090708.html |title=<U+5F52><U+6709><U+5149>_<U+4E2D><U+534E><U+4E94><U+5343><U+5E74> |trans_title=Gui Youguang |date=2007-09-22}}</ref>

==Legacy==
In 1828, Tao Shu, the Jiangsu [[Xunfu]] of that time, got permission from the emperor. A school named Zhenchuan Shuyuan was built to memorize Gui Youguang after three years<U+2019> construction.
Then in 1903, Zhenchuan Shuyuan was closed.
One year later, An Yuan and some other people founded the Zhenchuan Primary School at the same place as Zhenchuan Shuyuan. After several years, Zhenchuan junior high school was added to Zhenchuan Primary School.
Now the school is called Anting Junior High School which is located in Anting Town, Jiading District, Shanghai.
