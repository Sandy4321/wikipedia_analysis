The '''East 80th Street Houses''' are a group of four attached [[rowhouse]]s on that street in the [[New York City]] [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]]. They are made of brick with various stone trims in different versions of the [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] [[architectural style]].

They were built in the 1920s as homes for wealthy New Yorkers of that era, including [[Vincent Astor]], [[Clarence Dillon]] and George [[Whitney family|Whitney]]. All were designated city landmarks by 1967,<ref name="116 landmark designation">{{PDFlink|[http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/116-E-80TH-ST.pdf 116 E. 80th St.]}}, [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]; January 24, 1967.</ref><ref name="120 landmark designation">{{PDFlink|[http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/120-EAST-80TH.pdf 120 E. 80th St.]}}, [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]; November 12, 1968.</ref><ref name="Dillon House designation">{{PDFlink|[http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/CLARENCE-DILLON-HOUSE.pdf Clarence Dillon House]}}, [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]; January 24, 1967.</ref><ref name="Junior League Designation">{{PDFlink|[http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/JUNIOR-LEAGUE.pdf Junior League]}}, [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]; April 12, 1967.</ref> the first group of houses on the [[Upper East Side]] so recognized.<ref group="note">The first landmark designations on the Upper East Side, after [[Gracie Mansion]] in 1966, were the ones made on January 24, 1967. They included two of the East 80th Street Houses (Morris and Whitney) and the [[Edward Harkness House]] at 1 East 75th Street. They were the only three residential properties designated on that date.</ref> In 1980, all four houses were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as intact surviving examples of high-style townhouses for affluent homebuyers of that time period.

==Buildings==
The four houses are located on the south side of East 80th Street between [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park]] and [[Lexington Avenue (Manhattan)|Lexington]] avenues, on land that rises gently from East 79th Street to the south. The block has an assortment of similarly sized buildings, most more modern. It is primarily residential with [[mixed use development|mixed use]] development on the neighboring avenues. The area is considered part of the [[Upper East Side]].

Westernmost in the row is 116 East 80th, the Lewis Spencer Morris House. It is a four-story, four-[[bay (architecture)|bay]] building of brick laid in [[brickwork#Flemish bond|Flemish bond]] with [[marble]] trim topped by a [[pediment]] that hides the attic. Continous belt [[course (architecture)|courses]] divide the first story from the [[English basement]] below and second story above. They are echoed by a continuous stone [[cornice]] at the roofline. [[Festoon]]s and medallions decorate the [[entablature]] above. A projecting central section, flanked by entrance bays, features a central entrance where marble surrounds and consoles support an entablature below an arched [[fanlight]].<ref name="NRHP nom" /><ref name="116 landmark designation" />

Next door, 120 East 80th, the George Whitney House, is a six-story house also in brick with marble trim. Its most notable feature is a central projecting semicircular marble [[portico]] where two [[fluting (architecture)|fluted]] [[Doric order|Doric]] columns support an entablature at a string course between the first and second stories. The portico is reinforced by a round-arched main entrance and pedimented second-story window above. The other second story windows have iron railings and splayed brick lintels. Above the third story a cornice with blocks sets off the slate-covered [[mansard roof]], pierced by three dormers with segmental arched roofs on the first of its stories and four on the second, recessed slightly and set off with a wood railing. The top of the mansard roof conceals the sixth story.<ref name="NRHP nom" /><ref name="120 landmark designation" />

Its eastern neighbor, 124 East 80th, the [[Clarence Dillon]] House, is also a six-story brick building in the [[Georgian architecture#Post-Georgian developments|Neo-Georgian]] style. Its front [[facade]] culminates in a pediment, which along with the high end chimneys conceals the two top stories. It, too, has a [[classical architecture|classically]] detailed entrance, flanked by [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[pilaster]]s supporting a segmented pediment. Brick [[quoin (architecture)|quoins]] accentuate the second and third stories.<ref name="NRHP nom" /><ref name="Dillon House designation" />

The last house in the row, the [[Vincent Astor]] House at 130 East 80th, is the only one not of brick. It is a three-story, five-bay Neo-[[Adam style|Adamesque]] building faced in French [[limestone]] laid in an [[ashlar]] pattern. It shares classical detailing with the two houses to the west. The entrance, two paneled doors surmounted by a fanlight, is sheltered by a small portico supported by Ionic columns. The window above echoes the fanlight with a [[blind arch]], and on either side two-story Ionic pilasters support a full entablature with dentil course and four [[patera]]e. Above it a pediment with gently [[roof pitch|pitched]] slate roof runs the full width of the house.<ref name="NRHP nom" /><ref name="Junior League Designation" />

==History==

The block between 79th, 80th, Park and Lexington was first developed in 1870 with a row of 19 three-story [[brownstone]]s on the north side of 79th, right after the street was built. No other houses were built there until 1907, when two sisters had a double-width Georgian built at 123 East 79th. Eight years later, in 1915, a relative of theirs had a house built at 121 East 79th, which went all the way through to the back of the block. Other grand houses were built on East 79th, but the land behind them on the site of the East 80th Street houses remained undeveloped into the 1920s.<ref name="NYT story">{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Christopher|title=Discreet Charm That's Nestled in an Urban Canyon|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/07/realestate/discreet-charm-that-s-nestled-in-an-urban-canyon.html|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 7, 1997|accessdate=March 30, 2010}}</ref>

The first of the houses to be built on East 80th Street was 116. The firm of Cross & Cross, known for other designs in New York of the era such as Tiffany's and the Links Club, built the neo-[[Federal style|Federal]] home for Lewis Spencer Morris, a descendant of [[Lewis Morris]], signer of the [[Declaration of Independence]]. It was joined in 1927 by Mott Schmidt's neo-Adamesque style home for [[Vincent Astor]] at 130.<ref name="NRHP nom" /> Astor also had Schmidt design a matching garage to replace the brownstone at 121 East 79th.<ref name="NYT story" />
 
Two years later, the two architects built one more house apiece on the block. Cross & Cross contributed the neo-Georgian building at 120 for George Whitney in 1929, and in 1930 Schmidt put the finishing touch on the block with a similar house for financier [[Clarence Dillon]] at 124.<ref name="NRHP nom" /> During the late 1920s the four wealthy residents of the East 80th Street houses, who liked the location because the rise in the land complemented by the low houses behind them on the south side of East 79th let the sun into their gardens, bought up the [[lot (real estate)|lots]] behind them on the north side of East 79th. They did this to prevent them from being acquired by [[land development|developers]] of new high-rise apartment buildings that would have blocked the sun.<ref name="NYT story" />

The four houses were among the last built in their styles before the [[Great Depression]] changed American ideas about luxury housing.<ref name="116 landmark designation" /> The residents kept the block and their vacant rear lots together until 1942, when they began to sell them off. The [[Junior League]] of New York moved into the Astor House later in the decade, and found it so well maintained it did not need a [[Irrigation sprinkler|sprinkler]] system in the yard.<ref name="Junior League Designation" /> The last parcel, the Astors' garage, was sold by [[Brooke Astor]] in 1964.<ref name="NYT story" />

Three years later, in 1967, the Morris and Dillon houses were the first houses on the [[Upper East Side]] recognized by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|Landmarks Preservation Commission]].<ref name="116 landmark designation" /><ref name="Dillon House designation" /> The Astor House followed three months later.<ref name="Junior League Designation" /> Late in 1968, the Whitney House completed the set.<ref name="120 landmark designation" />

Other than the Junior League, the houses have largely remained private residential properties. At the time they were listed on the National Register, in 1980, the Dillon House was owned by [[Iraq]] for diplomatic purposes.<ref name="NRHP nom" /> In 2008 the Whitney House was purchased for $3.2 million by a developer who planned to convert it into a six-unit [[Housing cooperative#The New York Cooperative|co-op]].<ref name="NCB press release">{{cite press release |title= NCB Arranges Nearly $48 Million in Financing for New York Area Housing in May |publisher=[[National Cooperative Bank]] |date=June 11, 2008 |url=http://www.ncb.coop/default.aspx?id=3972 |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}</ref><ref name="blockshopper page">{{cite web|title=120 E. 80th St., Upper East Side, NY 10021|url=http://manhattan.blockshopper.com/property/1015080064-/120_e_80th_street|publisher=blockshopper.com|accessdate=March 30, 2010}}</ref>
