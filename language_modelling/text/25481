The '''Joker''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] who appears in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The character was created by [[Jerry Robinson]], [[Bill Finger]], and [[Bob Kane]], and first appeared in ''[[Batman (comic)|Batman]]'' #1 (April 25, 1940). Credit for the character's creation is disputed; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility for the Joker's design, while acknowledging Finger's writing contribution. Although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention, allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero [[Batman]].

In his comic book appearances, the Joker is portrayed as a criminal mastermind. Introduced as a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]] with a warped, sadistic sense of humor, the character became a goofy prankster in the late 1950s in response to regulation by the [[Comics Code Authority]], before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s. As Batman's nemesis, the Joker has been part of the superhero's defining stories, including the murder of [[Jason Todd]]<U+2014>the second [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and Batman's ward<U+2014>and the paralysis of Batman's ally, [[Barbara Gordon]]. The Joker has had various possible origin stories during his over seven decades in publication. The most common story is that he falls into a tank of chemical waste which bleaches his skin white, turns his hair green and his lips bright red; the resulting disfigurement drives him insane. The antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance, the Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary.

The Joker possesses no superhuman abilities, instead using his chemical and engineering genius to develop poisonous or lethal concoctions, and thematic weaponry, including razor-tipped [[Playing card]]s, deadly [[Joy buzzer]]s, and acid-spraying lapel flowers. While the Joker sometimes works with other supervillains such as the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] and [[Two-Face]], and groups like the [[Injustice Gang]] and [[Injustice League]], these relationships often collapse due to the Joker's desire for unbridled chaos. The 1990s introduced a romantic foil for the Joker in his former psychiatrist, [[Harley Quinn]], who becomes his villainous sidekick. Although his primary obsession is Batman, the Joker has also fought other heroes including [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]]. 

One of the most iconic characters in popular culture,<ref name="ImpactIGN2"/><ref name="ImpactComplex"/> the Joker has been cited as one of the greatest comic book villains and fictional characters ever created.<ref name="ImpactLATimes"/><ref name="ImpactIGNHero"/> He appears in a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectable items, real-world structures (such as theme park attractions) and references in a number of media. The Joker has been Batman's adversary in live-action and animated incarnations, including the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series (played by [[Cesar Romero]]) and in film by [[Jack Nicholson]] in 1989's ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' and [[Heath Ledger]] in 2008's ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (earning Ledger a posthumous [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]). [[Mark Hamill]], [[Michael Emerson]], [[Troy Baker]], and others have voiced the animated character.

==Publication history==

===Creation===
[[File:Jerry-Robinson-Joker-Sketch-Card.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Sketch of a playing card with a grinning Joker|Jerry Robinson's 1940 concept sketch of the Joker]]
[[Jerry Robinson]], [[Bill Finger]] and [[Bob Kane]] are credited with creating the Joker, but each man had their own version of the character's conception and their role in it. Elements of the character's roots include a photo of actor [[Conrad Veidt]] as Gwynplaine (a man with a disfigured face, giving him a perpetual grin) in the 1928 film ''[[The Man Who Laughs (1928 film)|The Man Who Laughs]]'', which was seen by Finger, and a [[Joker (playing card)|joker playing card]] provided by Robinson. Finger said that he was also inspired by an image in [[Steeplechase Park]] at [[Coney Island]], and Robinson cited his 1940 sketch as the source of the Joker's design. Although Kane adamantly refused to share credit for many of his characters (and refused to credit Robinson until Kane's death), many comic historians credit Robinson with the Joker's creation and Finger with the character's development.<ref name="ImpactCBR"/><ref name="Creation1"/><ref name="Creation2"/><ref name="Creation4"/> In a 1994 interview with journalist [[Frank Lovece]], Kane said:

{{quote|Bill Finger and I created the Joker. Bill was the writer. Jerry Robinson came to me with a playing card of the Joker. That's the way I sum it up. [The Joker] looks like Conrad Veidt&nbsp;<U+2013> you know, the actor in ''The Man Who Laughs'', [the 1928 movie based on the novel] by [[Victor Hugo]].&nbsp;... Bill Finger had a book with a photograph of Conrad Veidt and showed it to me and said, 'Here's the Joker'. Jerry Robinson had absolutely nothing to do with it, but he'll always say he created it till he dies. He brought in a [[playing card]], which we used for a couple of issues for him [the Joker] to use as his playing card.<ref name="Creation101"/><ref name="KaneLovece"/>}}

Robinson credited himself, Finger and Kane for the Joker's creation. He said he created the character as Batman's larger-than-life nemesis when extra stories were quickly needed for ''Batman'' #1, and he received credit for the story in a college course:<ref name="Creation102"/>

{{quote|In that first meeting when I showed them that sketch of the Joker, Bill said it reminded him of Conrad Veidt in ''The Man Who Laughs''. That was the first mention of it&nbsp;... He can be credited and Bob himself, we all played a role in it. The concept was mine. Bill finished that first script from my outline of the persona and what should happen in the first story. He wrote the script of that, so he really was co-creator, and Bob and I did the visuals, so Bob was also.<ref name="Creation103"/>}}

Kane hired the 17-year-old Robinson as an assistant in 1939, after he saw Robinson in a white jacket decorated with his own illustrations.<ref name="Creation4"/><ref name="Creation3"/> Beginning as a [[letterer]] and background inker, Robinson quickly became primary artist for the newly created ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' comic book series. In a 1975 interview in ''Amazing World of DC Comics'', Robinson said he wanted a supreme arch-villain who could test Batman, but not a typical crime lord or gangster designed to be easily disposed. He wanted an exotic, enduring character as an ongoing source of conflict for Batman (similar to the relationship between [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Professor Moriarty]]), designing a diabolically sinister-but-clownish villain.<ref name="Creation5"/><ref name="Origin3"/>{{sfn|Tollin|1975|pp=2-3}} Robinson was intrigued by villains; his studies at [[Columbia University]] taught him that some characters are made up of contradictions, leading to the Joker's sense of humor. He said that the name came first, followed by an image of a playing card from a deck he often had at hand: "I wanted somebody visually exciting. I wanted somebody that would make an indelible impression, would be bizarre, would be memorable like the [[Hunchback of Notre Dame]] or any other villains that had unique physical characters."<ref name="Creation7"/><ref name="Creation8"/> He told Finger about his concept by telephone, later providing sketches of the character and images of what would become his iconic Joker playing-card design. Finger thought the concept was incomplete, providing the image of Veidt with a ghastly, permanent [[Risus sardonicus|rictus grin]]. Kane disputed Robinson's story; however, because Finger credited Robinson historians generally accept the latter's version of events.<ref name="Creation5"/> By 2011, Robinson, Finger, and Kane had died, leaving the story unresolved.<ref name="Creation2"/><ref name="Creation5"/><ref name="GoldenAge6"/>

===Golden Age===
[[File:Comic Book - The Joker (1940).jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Comic book panel of the grinning Joker|From the Joker's debut in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #1 (April 25, 1940)]]
The Joker debuted in ''Batman'' #1 (1940) as Batman's first villain, shortly after the latter's debut in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #27 (May 1939). The Joker initially appeared as a remorseless serial killer, modeled after a joker playing card with a mirthless grin, who killed his victims with "Joker venom": a toxin which left their faces smiling grotesquely.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=21}} The character was intended to be killed in his second appearance in ''Batman'' #1, after being stabbed in the heart. Finger wanted the Joker to die because of his concern that recurring villains would make Batman appear inept, but was overruled by then-editor [[Whitney Ellsworth]]; a hastily drawn panel, indicating that the Joker was still alive, was added to the comic.<ref name="ImpactCBR"/><ref name="GoldenAge1"/><ref name="GoldenAge3"/> The Joker went on to appear in nine of ''Batman''{{'}}s first twelve issues.<ref name="GoldenAge2"/>

The character's regular appearances quickly defined him as the archenemy of the dynamic duo, Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]; he killed dozens of people, and even derailed a train. By issue #13, Kane's work on the [[Print syndication|syndicated]] ''Batman'' newspaper strip left him little time for the comic book; artist [[Dick Sprang]] assumed his duties, and editor Jack Schiff collaborated with Finger on stories. During this period, the first changes in the Joker began to appear; when he kidnaps Robin the ransom is paid by check, and he cannot cash it without being arrested. Around the same time, DC Comics found it easier to market its stories to children without the characters' more mature elements.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=24, 27}}

The 1942 cover of ''Detective Comics'' #69, known as "Double Guns" (with the Joker emerging from a genie lamp, aiming two guns at Batman and Robin), is considered one of the greatest superhero comic covers of the Golden Age and is the only image of the character using traditional guns. Robinson said that other contemporary villains used guns, and the creative team wanted the Joker<U+2014>as Batman's adversary<U+2014>to be more resourceful.<ref name="Creation7"/><ref name="DoubleGuns"/>

===Silver Age===
The Joker was one of the few popular villains appearing regularly in Batman comics from the Golden Age into the Silver Age, as the series continued during the rise in popularity of mystery and romance comics. In 1951, Finger wrote an [[origin story]] for the Joker in ''Detective Comics'' #168, which introduced the concept of him formerly being the criminal [[Red Hood]], and his disfigurement the result of a fall into a chemical vat.<ref name="SilverAge1"/>

By 1954, the [[Comics Code Authority]] had been established in response to increasing public disapproval of comic book content. The backlash was inspired by [[Frederic Wertham]], who hypothesized that mass media (especially comic books) was responsible for the rise in [[juvenile delinquency]], violence and homosexuality, particularly in young males. Parents forbade their children from reading comic books, and there were several mass burnings.<ref name="ImpactCBR"/> The Comics Code banned gore, innuendo and excessive violence, stripping Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into a goofy, thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies.<ref name="GoldenAge1"/>{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=171}} The character appeared less frequently after 1964, when [[Julius Schwartz]] (who despised the Joker) became editor of the Batman comics, and the character remained largely absent throughout the decade.<ref name="ImpactCBR"/><ref name="GoldenAge1"/><ref name="GoldenAge5"/> The character risked becoming an obscure figure of the preceding era until this goofy prankster version of the character was adapted into the 1966 television series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', in which he was played by [[Cesar Romero]].<ref name="ImpactCBR"/><ref name="GoldenAge1"/> The campy show's popularity (including Romero's Joker) compelled Schwartz to keep the comics in a similar vein. As the show's popularity waned, however, so did that of the ''Batman'' comics.<ref name="ImpactCBR"/><ref name="GoldenAge5"/> After the TV series ended in 1968, the increase in public visibility had not stopped the comic's sales decline; editorial director [[Carmine Infantino]] resolved to turn things around, moving stories away from schoolboy-friendly adventures.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=173}} The Silver Age introduced several of the Joker's defining character traits: lethal [[joy buzzer]]s, acid-squirting flowers, trick guns, and goofy, elaborate crimes.<ref name="Personality2"/><ref name="JokerGadgets"/>

===Bronze Age===
[[File:Comic Book - Batman 251 Cover (1973).jpg|185px|thumb|alt="Batman" cover, with the Joker holding an ace of spades with Batman on it|Cover of ''Batman'' #251 (Sept. 1973) featuring "The Joker's Five-Way Revenge", which returned the Joker to his homicidal roots; art by Neal Adams]]
In 1973, after a four-year disappearance,<ref name="ImpactCBR"/> the Joker was revived (and revised) by writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artist [[Neal Adams]]. Beginning with ''Batman'' #251's "The Joker's Five-Way Revenge", the character returns to his roots as an impulsive, homicidal maniac who matches wits with Batman.<ref name="ImpactCBR2"/><ref name="BronzeAge6"/> This story began a trend in which the Joker was used, sparingly, as a central character.<ref name="BronzeAge10"/> O'Neil said his idea was "simply to take it back to where it started. I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories. I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after."<ref name="BronzeAge8"/> O'Neil's 1973 run introduced the Joker's legal insanity, the reason he was sent to Arkham Asylum (then Arkham Hospital) after its creation in 1974 instead of to prison.<ref name="BronzeAge20"/> Adams modified the Joker's appearance, changing his more average figure by extending his jaw and making him taller and leaner.<ref name="BronzeAge9"/>

DC Comics was a hotbed of experimentation during the 1970s, and in 1975 the character became the first villain to star in a comic book series, [[Joker (comic book)|''The Joker'']].{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=176}} Following the character's interactions with other supervillains, the series' first issue was written by O'Neil.<ref name="1975JokerComic"/> Stories balanced between emphasizing the Joker's criminality and making him a likable protagonist whom readers could support. Although he murdered thugs and civilians, he never fought Batman; this made ''The Joker'' a series in which the character's villainy prevailed over equivalent rivals, instead of a struggle between good and evil.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=177}} Because the Comics Code Authority mandated punishment for villains, each issue ended with the Joker being apprehended, limiting the scope of each story. The series never found an audience, and ''The Joker'' was cancelled after nine issues (despite a "next issue" advertisement for an appearance by the [[Justice League]]).<ref name="1975JokerComic"/>{{sfn|Duncan Smith|2013|p=380}}{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=177}}

When [[Jenette Kahn]] became DC editor in 1976, she redeveloped the company's struggling titles; during her tenure, the Joker would become one of DC's most popular characters.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=177}} While O'Neil and Adams' work was critically acclaimed, writer [[Steve Englehart]] and [[penciller]] [[Marshall Rogers]]'s eight-issue run in ''Detective Comics'' #471-476 (August 1977-April 1978) defined the Joker for decades to come<ref name="ImpactCBR2"/> with stories emphasizing the character's insanity. In "The Laughing Fish", the Joker disfigures fish by giving them a rictus grin (expecting [[copyright]] protection), killing bureaucrats who tell him that copyrighting a [[natural resource]] is legally impossible.<ref name="BronzeAge6"/><ref name="BronzeAge20"/><ref name="Bio101"/><ref name="BronzeAge7"/> Engelhart and Rogers' work on the series influenced the 1989 film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', and was adapted for 1992's ''[[Batman: the Animated Series]]''.<ref name="BronzeAge20"/><ref name="BronzeAge4"/> Rogers expanded on Adams' character design (adding a fedora and trench coat to the Joker's wardrobe),<ref name="BronzeAge9"/> and Englehart outlined his Joker: "He was this very crazy, scary character. I really wanted to get back to the idea of Batman fighting insane murderers at 3&nbsp;a.m. under the full moon, as the clouds scuttled by."<ref name="GoldenAge1"/>

==={{anchor|Modern age}}Modern Age===
Years after the end of the 1966 television series, sales of ''Batman'' continued to fall and the title was nearly canceled. Although the 1970s restored the Joker as an insane, lethal foe of Batman, it was during the 1980s that the ''Batman'' series started to turn around and the Joker came into his own as part of the "dark age" of comics: mature tales of death and destruction. The shift was derided for moving away from tamer superheroes (and villains), but comic audiences were no longer primarily children.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=182}}<ref name="ImpactCBR2"/> Several months after ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' launched the era by killing off Silver-Age icons such as [[Flash (comics)|the Flash]] and [[Supergirl]] and undoing decades of continuity, [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' (1986) re-imagined Batman as an older, retired hero and the Joker as a lipstick-wearing celebrity who cannot function without his foe.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=183}}<ref name="BronzeAge9"/><ref name="ModernAge1"/><ref name="ModernAge2"/><ref name="ModernAge4"/> The late 1980s saw the Joker exert a significant impact on Batman and his supporting cast. In the 1988<U+2013>89 story arc "[[Batman: A Death in the Family|A Death in the Family]]", the Joker murders Batman's sidekick (the second Robin, [[Jason Todd]]). Fans never accepted Todd; rather than modify his character, DC opted to let them vote for his fate and a 28-vote plurality had the Joker beat Todd to death with a crowbar. This story altered the Batman universe: instead of killing anonymous bystanders, the Joker murdered a core character in the ''Batman'' fiction; this had a lasting effect on future stories.<ref name="ModernAge5"/>{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=108}} Written at the height of tensions between the United States and Iran, the story's conclusion had Iranian leader [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] appoint the Joker his country's ambassador to the United Nations (allowing him to temporarily escape justice).<ref name="InfoDoG1"/>

[[Alan Moore]] and [[Brian Bolland]]'s 1988 graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]'' expands on the Joker's origins, describing the character as a failed comedian who adopts the identity of Red Hood to support his pregnant wife.<ref name="SilverAge1"/><ref>Greenberger and Manning, p. 38: "Offering keen insight into both the minds of the Joker and Batman, this special is considered by most Batman fans to be the definitive Joker story of all time."</ref> Unlike ''The Dark Knight Returns'', ''The Killing Joke'' takes place in mainstream continuity.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=188}} The novel is described as one of the greatest Joker stories ever written, influencing later comic stories (including the forced retirement of then-[[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] Barbara Gordon after she is paralyzed by the Joker) and films such as 1989's ''Batman'' and 2008's ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''.<ref name="ModernAge10"/><ref name="ModernAge11"/> [[Grant Morrison]]'s 1989 ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth]]'' explores the psychoses of Batman, the Joker and other rogues in the eponymous facility.<ref name="ModernAge12"/><ref name="ModernAge13"/>

The 1992 animated series introduced the Joker's female sidekick: [[Harley Quinn]], a psychologist who falls for<U+2014>and ends up in an abusive relationship with<U+2014>the Joker, becoming his [[supervillain]] accomplice. The character was popular, and was adapted into the comics as the Joker's romantic interest in 1999.<ref name="ModernAge15"/> In the same year, [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and [[Norm Breyfogle]]'s comic book, ''[[Anarky (comic book)|Anarky]]'', concluded with the revelation that [[Anarky|the titular character]] was the Joker's son. Breyfogle conceived the idea as a means to expand on Anarky's characterization, but O'Neil (by then the editor for the ''Batman'' series of books) was opposed to it, and only allowed it to be written under protest, and with a promise that the revelation would eventually be revealed incorrect. However, the ''Anarky'' series was cancelled before the rebuttal could be published.<ref name="Anarky"/> The Joker's first major storyline in [[The New 52]], DC Comics' 2011 reboot of story continuity, was 2012's "[[Death of the Family]]" by writer [[Scott Snyder]] and artist [[Greg Capullo]]. The story arc explores the [[Symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]] between Joker and Batman, and sees the villain shatter the trust between Batman and his adopted family.<ref name="GoldenAge2"/><ref name="ModernAge14"/> Capullo's Joker design replaced his traditional outfit with a utilitarian, messy, and disheveled appearance to convey that the character was on a mission; his face (surgically removed in 2011's ''Detective Comics'' #1) was reattached with belts, wires, and hooks, and he was outfitted with mechanics overalls.<ref name="ModernAgeDOTF"/> The Joker's face was restored in Snyder's and Capullo's "[[Batman: Endgame|Endgame]]" (2014), the concluding chapter to "Death of the Family", which featured the deaths of Joker and Batman.<ref name="NewsaramaEndgame"/><ref name="Guardian"/>

=={{anchor|Fictional character biography}}Character biography==
The Joker has undergone many revisions since his 1940 debut. The most common interpretation of the character is that he is disguised as the criminal Red Hood, and pursued by Batman. The Joker falls into a vat of chemicals which bleaches his skin, colors his hair green and his lips red, and drives him insane. The reasons why the Joker was disguised as the Red Hood, and his identity before his transformation have changed over time.<ref name="GoldenAge1"/>

The character was introduced in ''Batman'' #1 (1940), in which he announces that he will kill three of Gotham's prominent citizens (including Mayor Henry Claridge). Although the police protect Claridge, the Joker poisoned him before making his announcement and Claridge dies with a ghastly grin on his face. The Joker tries to poison Robin with the same Joker venom, Batman defeats him, sending him to prison.<ref name="JokerBioGeek2"/> The Joker commits whimsical, brutal crimes for reasons that, in Batman's words, "make sense to him alone."<ref name="Bio101"/> ''Detective Comics'' #168 (1951) introduced the Joker's first origin story as Red Hood: a criminal who, during his final heist, vanishes after leaping into a vat of chemicals to escape Batman. His resulting disfigurement led him to adopt the name "Joker", from the playing card he now resembled.<ref name="SilverAge1"/> The Joker's Silver-Age transformation into a figure of fun was established in 1952's "The Joker's Millions". In this story the Joker is obsessed with maintaining his illusion of wealth and celebrity as a criminal folk hero, afraid to let Gotham's citizens know that he is penniless and was tricked out of his fortune.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=27}} The 1970s redefined the character as a homicidal psychopath. "The Joker's Five-Way Revenge" has the Joker taking violent revenge on the former gang members who betrayed him;<ref name="BronzeAge10"/> in "The Laughing Fish" the character chemically adds his face to Gotham's fish (hoping to profit from a copyright), killing bureaucrats who stand in his way.<ref name="BronzeAge6"/>

''Batman: The Killing Joke'' (1988) built on the Joker's 1951 origin story, portraying him as a failed comedian pressured into committing crime as the Red Hood to support his pregnant wife. Batman's interference causes him to leap into a chemical vat, which disfigures him. This, combined with the trauma of his wife's earlier accidental death, causes him to go insane and become the Joker.<ref name="SilverAge1"/> However, he says that this story may not be true and prefers his past to be "multiple choice".<ref name="TKJ"/> In this graphic novel, the Joker shoots and paralyzes Barbara Gordon and tortures her father, [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]], to prove that it only takes one bad day to turn a sane man into a psychopath.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=188}} After Batman rescues Gordon and subdues the Joker, he offers to rehabilitate his old foe and end their rivalry. Although the Joker refuses, he shows his appreciation by sharing a joke with Batman.<ref name="PersonalityTKJ"/>

Though a number of [[backstory|backstories]] have been given, a definitive one has not yet been established for the Joker. An [[unreliable narrator]], the character is uncertain of who he was before and how he became the Joker: "Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another&nbsp;... if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"<ref name="Origin3"/><ref name="TKJ"/> A story about the Joker's origin appeared in ''Detective Comics'' #168 (February 1951), nearly a decade after the character's debut. Here, the character is a laboratory worker who becomes the Red Hood (a masked criminal) to steal a million dollars from his employer and retire. He falls into a vat of chemical waste when his heist is thwarted by Batman, emerging with bleached white skin, red lips, green hair and a permanent grin.<ref name="Origin1"/><ref name="Origin2"/>

This story was the basis for the most often-cited origin tale, Moore's [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''The Killing Joke''.<ref name="ModernAge11"/> The Joker quits his job, becoming a stand-up comedian to support his pregnant wife. Unsuccessful, he agrees to help mobsters with a robbery and dons the Red Hood. The heist goes awry; the comedian leaps into a chemical vat to escape Batman, surfacing disfigured. This, combined with the earlier accidental death of his wife and unborn child, drives the comedian insane and he becomes the Joker.<ref name="SilverAge1"/><ref name="ImpactCBR2"/> This version has been cited in many stories, including ''[[Batman: The Man Who Laughs]]'' (in which Batman deduces that the Red Hood survived his fall and became the Joker), ''Batman'' #450 (in which the Joker dons the Red Hood to aid his recovery after the events in ''A Death in the Family'', but finds the experience too traumatic) and "Death of the Family".<ref name="Origin2"/> Other stories have expanded on this origin; "[[Batman: Gotham Knights|Pushback]]" explains that the Joker's wife was murdered by a corrupt policeman working for the mobsters,<ref name="OriginPushback"/> and "Payback" gives the Joker's first name as "Jack".<ref name="Origin2"/>

However, the Joker's unreliable memory has allowed writers to develop other origins for the character.<ref name="Origin2"/> The [[Paul Dini]]-[[Alex Ross]] story, "Case Study", describes the Joker as a sadistic gangster who creates the Red Hood identity to continue the thrill of small-time criminality. He has his fateful first meeting with Batman, which results in his disfigurement. It is suggested that the Joker is sane, and feigns insanity to avoid the death penalty. In ''[[Batman Confidential]]'' (#7-12), the character, Jack, is a talented criminal who is bored with his work. He encounters (and becomes obsessed with) Batman during a heist, embarking on a crime spree to attract his attention. After Jack injures Batman's girlfriend, the Dark Knight vengefully scars his face with a [[Glasgow smile|permanent grin]]. Batman then betrays Jack to a group of mobsters, who torture him in a chemical plant. Jack escapes, but falls into an empty vat as gunfire punctures chemical tanks above him. The flood of chemicals (used in [[anti-psychotic]] medication) alters his appearance and completes his transformation.<ref name="ComicBatmanConfidential"/> The superhero [[Atom (comics)|Atom]] sees the Joker's memory of burning his parents alive (after they find him killing animals) in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #31,<ref name="BraveandBold31Review"/> and Snyder's "[[Batman: Zero Year|Zero Year]]" (2013) suggests that the pre-disfigurement Joker was a criminal mastermind leading a gang of Red Hoods.<ref name="OriginZeroYear"/><ref name="IGNEndgame"/>

The Joker has claimed a number of origins, including being the child of an abusive father who broke his nose and the long-lived jester of an Egyptian pharaoh. As Batman says, "Like any other comedian, he uses whatever material will work".{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=136}}

===Other versions===
{{Main|Alternative versions of Joker}}
A number of [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]s in DC Comics publications allow writers to introduce variations on the Joker, in which the character's origins, behavior and morality differ from the mainstream setting.<ref name="Multiverse"/> ''The Dark Knight Returns'' depicts the final battle between an aged Batman and Joker;<ref name="ModernAge1"/> others portray the aftermath of the Joker's death at the hands of a number of characters, including Superman.<ref name="JokerBioGeek3"/><ref name="OtherInjustice"/> Still others describe distant futures, in which the Joker is a computer virus or a hero trying to defeat the era's tyrannical Batman.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=38}} In some stories, the Joker is someone else entirely; "[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" features Batman's mother [[Martha Wayne]] as the Joker in response to her son's murder,<ref name="OtherFlashpoint"/> and in ''[[Superman: Speeding Bullets]]'' [[Lex Luthor]] becomes the Joker in a world where Superman is Batman.<ref name="OtherSpeeding"/>

==Characterization==
Renowned as Batman's greatest enemy, the Joker is known by a number of nicknames: the Clown Prince of Crime, the Jester of Genocide,<ref name="IGNRogues"/> the Harlequin of Hate, and the Ace of Knaves.<ref name="Nicknames"/> During the evolution of the [[DC Universe]], interpretations and versions of the Joker have taken two forms. The original, dominant image is that of an extreme [[Psychopathy|psychopath]],{{sfn|Langley|2013|p=130}} with genius-level intelligence and a warped, sadistic sense of humor.<ref name="CrackingUp"/><ref name="ComicsComix"/> The other version, popular in comic books from the late 1940s to the 1960s and in the 1960s television series, is an eccentric, harmless prankster and thief. The Joker is typically seen in a purple suit with a long-tailed, padded-shoulder jacket, a string tie, gloves, striped pants and [[Spats (footwear)|spats]] on pointed-toe shoes (sometimes with a wide-brimmed hat). This appearance is such a fundamental aspect of the character that when the 2004 animated series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' placed the Joker in a straitjacket, it quickly redesigned him in his familiar suit.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=69}}

The Joker is obsessed with Batman, the pair representing a yin-yang of opposing dark and light force; although it is the Joker who represents humor and colour and Batman who dwells in the dark.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=37}} Murder, theft, and terrorism, no crime is beyond the Joker, and his exploits are a theatrical performance that are funny to him alone. Although the Joker claims indifference to everything, he secretly craves Batman's attention and validation.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=105}}<ref name="BronzeAge6"/> The character was described as having killed over 2,000 people in ''[[The Joker: Devil's Advocate]]'' (1996). Despite this body count, he is always found [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]] and sent to Arkham Asylum, avoiding the death penalty.<ref name="JokerDevilsAdvocate"/>{{sfn|Langley|2013|p=162-163}} Many of the Joker's acts attempt to force Batman to kill; if the most orderly and self-controlled of humans can murder, anyone is capable of becoming a monster like the Joker. The villain displays no instinct for self-preservation, and is willing to die to prove his point.<ref name="ImpactMoral3"/>

===Personality===
[[File:ComicCon2008jerryrobinson.jpg|upright|thumb|alt=Smiling, bearded white-haired man|Joker co-creator [[Jerry Robinson]] in 2008; he conceived the Joker as an exotic, enduring arch-villain who could repeatedly challenge Batman.]]
The Joker's main characteristic is his apparent insanity, although he is not described as having any particular psychological disorder. Like a psychopath, he lacks empathy, a conscience, and concern over right and wrong. In ''A Serious House on Serious Earth'', the Joker is described as capable of processing outside sensory information only by adapting to it. This enables him to create a new personality every day (depending on what would benefit him) and explains why, at different times, he is a mischievous clown or a psychopathic killer.{{sfn|Langley|2013|pp=180-181}} ''The Killing Joke'' (in which the Joker is the unreliable narrator) explains the roots of his insanity as "one bad day": losing his wife and unborn child and being disfigured by chemicals, paralleling Batman's origin in the loss of his parents. He tries (and fails) to prove that anyone can become like him after one bad day by torturing Commissioner Gordon, physically and psychologically.<ref name="Personality2"/>{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=188}} Batman offers to rehabilitate his foe; the Joker apologetically declines, believing it too late for him to be saved.<ref name="PersonalityTKJ"/> Other interpretations show him fully aware of how his actions affect others and his insanity as merely an act.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=37}} Comics scholar [[Peter Coogan]] describes the Joker as trying to reshape reality to fit himself by imposing his face on his victims (and fish) in an attempt to make the world comprehensible by creating a twisted parody of himself. Englehart's "The Laughing Fish" demonstrates the character's illogical nature: trying to copyright fish which bear his face, and not understanding why threatening the copyright clerk cannot produce the desired result.{{sfn|Langley|2013|pp=183-184}}<ref name="BronzeAge20"/>

The Joker is alternatively depicted as sexual and asexual. In ''The Dark Knight Returns'' and ''Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth'', the Joker is seductive toward Batman; it is uncertain if their relationship has homoerotic undertones or if the Joker is simply trying to manipulate his nemesis. Frank Miller interpreted the character as fixated on death and uninterested in sexual relationships, while Robinson believes that the Joker is capable of a romantic relationship.{{sfn|Duncan Smith|2013|p=379}} His relationship with Harley Quinn is abusively paradoxical; although the Joker keeps her at his side, he heedlessly harms her (for example, throwing her out a window without seeing if she survives). Harley loves him but the Joker does not reciprocate her feelings, chiding her for distracting him from other plans.{{sfn|Langley|2013|pp=177-180}}

Snyder's "Death of the Family" describes the Joker as in love with Batman, although not in a traditionally romantic way. The Joker believes that Batman has not killed him because he makes Batman better, and he loves the villain for that.<ref name="ModernAge14"/><ref name="CharacterDOTF"/> The Joker and Batman represent opposites: the extroverted Joker wears colorful clothing and embraces chaos, while the introverted, monochromatic Batman represents order and discipline. The Joker is often depicted as defining his existence through his conflict with Batman. In 1994's "Going Sane" the villain tries to lead a normal life after Batman's (apparent) death, reverting when Batman reappears; in "Emperor Joker", an apparently omnipotent Joker cannot destroy Batman without undoing himself. Since the Joker is simply "the Joker", he believes that Batman is "Batman" (with or without the costume) and has no interest in what is behind Batman's mask, ignoring opportunities to learn Batman's secret identity.{{sfn|Manning|2011|pp=37-38}}<ref name="JokerBioGeek3"/> Given the opportunity to kill Batman, the villain demurs; he believes that without their game, winning is pointless.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=105}} The character has no desire for typical criminal goals like money or power; his criminality is designed only to continue his game with Batman.<ref name="JokerBioGeek"/>

The Joker does not express any fears, showing no effect when exposed to the supervillain [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]'s fear gas in ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' (1993).<ref name="DetectiveComic664"/> The villain has been temporarily rendered sane by several means, including [[telepathy|telepathic]] manipulation by the [[Martian Manhunter]]<ref name="PersonalityTKJ"/> and being resurrected in a life-restoring [[Lazarus Pit]] (an experience typically inducing temporary insanity in the subject). At these moments, the Joker is depicted as expressing remorse for his acts;<ref name="ComicLotDarkKnight145"/><ref name="ComicJLA15"/> however, during a medically induced period of partial sanity in ''[[Batman: Cacophony]]'' he tells his opponent: "I don't hate you 'cause I'm crazy. I'm crazy 'cause I hate you" and confirms that he will only stop murdering when Batman is dead.<ref name="CraveCacophony"/><ref name="ComicCacophony"/>

===Skills and equipment===
The Joker has no inherent superhuman abilities.<ref name="ImpactWhatCulture"/> He commits crimes with a variety of weaponized thematic props such as a deck of razor-tipped playing cards, rolling marbles, [[Jack-in-the-box]]es with unpleasant surprises and exploding cigars capable of leveling a building. The flower in his lapel sprays acid, and his hand often holds a lethal joy buzzer conducting a million volts of electricity, although both items were introduced in 1952 as harmless joke items.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=70}}<ref name="JokerGadgets"/> However, his chemical genius provides his most-notable weapon: Joker venom, a liquid or gaseous toxin which sends its targets into fits of uncontrollable laughter; higher doses can lead to paralysis, coma or death, leaving its victim with a ghoulish, pained rictus grin. The Joker has used venom since his debut; only he knows the formula, and is shown to be gifted enough to manufacture the toxin from ordinary household chemicals. Another version of the venom (used in "Joker's Last Laugh") makes its victims resemble the Joker, susceptible to his orders.<ref name="BronzeAge6"/><ref name="JokerBioGeek2"/><ref name="WeaponsVenom"/>{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=69, 124}} The villain is immune to venom and most poisons; in ''Batman'' #663 (2007), Morrison writes that being "an avid consumer of his own chemical experiments, the Joker's immunity to poison concoctions that might kill another man in an instant has been developed over years of dedicated abuse".<ref name="Batman663"/>{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=69}}

The character's arsenal is inspired by his nemesis' weaponry, such as [[batarang]]s. In "The Joker's Utility Belt" (1952), he mimicked [[Batman's utility belt]] with non-lethal items, such as Mexican jumping beans and sneezing powder.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=70}} In 1942's "The Joker Follows Suit" the villain built his versions of the [[Batplane]] and [[Batmobile]], the Jokergyro and Jokermobile (the latter with a large Joker face on its hood), and created a Joker signal with which criminals could summon him for their heists.{{sfn|Manning|2011|pp=70,75}} The Jokermobile lasted for several decades, evolving with the Batmobile. His technical genius is not limited by practicality, allowing him to hijack Gotham's television airwaves to issue threats, transform buildings into death traps, launch a gas attack on the city and rain poisoned glass shards on its citizens from an airship.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=75}}<ref name="IGNJokerStories"/>

The Joker is portrayed as skilled in [[melee]] combat, from his initial appearances when he defeats Batman in a sword fight (nearly killing him), and others when he overwhelms Batman but declines to kill him.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=24, 37-38, 105}} He is talented with firearms, although even his guns are theatrical; his long-barreled revolver often releases a flag reading "Bang", and a second trigger-pull launches the flag to skewer its target.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=70}}<ref name="Debut"/> Although formidable in combat, the Joker's chief asset is his mind.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=38}}

===Relationships===
{{see also|List of Batman Family adversaries}}
The Joker's unpredictable, homicidal nature makes him one of the most feared supervillains in the DC Universe; the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] says in the 2005 mini-series ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'', "When super-villains want to scare each other, they tell Joker stories."<ref name="BatmanUnauthorized"/><ref name="UnderworldUnleashed"/> Gotham's villains also feel threatened by the character; depending on the circumstances, he is as likely to fight with his rivals for control of the city as he is to join them for an entertaining outcome.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=83}} The Joker interacts with other supervillains who oppose Batman, whether he is on the streets or in Arkham Asylum. He has collaborated with criminals like the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], the [[Riddler]] and [[Two-Face]], although these partnerships rarely end well due to the Joker's desire for unbridled chaos, and uses his stature to lead others (such as [[Killer Croc]] and the Scarecrow).{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=83, 86}} The Joker's greatest rival is the smartest man in the world, Lex Luthor. Although they have a friendly partnership in 1950's ''World's Finest Comics'' #88, later unions emphasized their mutual hostility and clashing egos.{{sfn|Manning|2011|pp=86,93}}

Despite his tendency to kill subordinates on a whim, the Joker has no difficulty attracting henchmen with a seemingly infinite cash supply and intimidation: they are too afraid of their employer to refuse his demands that they wear red clown noses or laugh at macabre jokes.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=75}} Even with his unpredictability and lack of superhuman powers, the 2007 limited series ''Salvation Run'' sees hundreds of villains fall under his spell because they are more afraid of him than the alternative: Luthor.{{sfn|Manning|2011|pp=124, 126}} ''Batman'' #186 (1966) introduced the Joker's first sidekick: the one-shot character, Gaggy Gagsworth, who is short, and dressed like a clown; the character was later resurrected as an enemy of his replacement, Harley Quinn.<ref name="SidekickGaggy"/><ref name="SidekickGaggy2"/> Introduced in the 1992 animated series, Quinn is the Joker's former Arkham psychiatrist who develops an obsessive infatuation with him and dons a red-and-black [[harlequin]] costume to join him in the 1999 graphic novel ''Batman: Harley Quinn''. Although Quinn loves the Joker, he is obsessed with Batman and uses her to achieve his goals at her expense. Despite violent abuse, she returns to him.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=143, 152}}<ref name="SidekickGaggy2"/> The Joker is sometimes shown to keep [[hyena]]s as pets; this trait was introduced in the 1977 animated series ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]''.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=75}} A 1976 issue of ''[[Batman Family]]'' introduced [[Duela Dent]] as the Joker's daughter, though her parentage claim was later proven to be false.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=177}}

Although his chief obsession is Batman, the character has occasionally ventured outside Gotham City to fight Batman's superhero allies. In "To Laugh and Die in Metropolis" (1987) the character kidnaps [[Lois Lane]], distracting Superman with a nuclear weapon. The story is notable for the Joker taking on a (relative) god and the ease with which Superman defeats him<U+2014>it took only 17 pages. Asked why he came to Metropolis, the Joker replies simply: "Oh Superman, why not?"{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=121}} In 1995, the Joker fought his third major DC hero: [[Wonder Woman]], who drew on the Greek god of trickery to temper the Joker's humor and shatter his confidence.{{sfn|Manning|2011|p=121-122, 124}} The character has joined supervillain groups like the [[Injustice Gang]] and the [[Injustice League]], to take on superhero groups like the Justice League.<ref name="Teamup1"/><ref name="Teamup2"/>

The Joker is considered one of, if not, the most-recognizable and iconic fictional characters in popular culture (Batman's arguable equal),<ref name="ImpactIGN2"/><ref name="ImpactComplex"/><ref name="LubbockOnline"/> one of the best comic villains, and one of the greatest villains of all-time.<ref name="ImpactLATimes"/><ref name="ImpactIGNHero"/> The character was well-liked following his debut, appearing in nine out of the first twelve ''Batman'' issues, and remained one of Batman's most popular foes throughout his publication.<ref name="CBR75Greatest"/> The character is considered one of the four top comic book characters, alongside Batman, Superman, and [[Spider-Man]].<ref name="LubbockOnline"/> The character has been the focus of ethical discussion on the desirability of Batman (who adheres to an unbreakable code forbidding killing) saving lives by murdering the Joker (a relentless dealer of death).
