"'''Who Killed Archie?'''" is a storyline from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', which began on 25 December 2009, [[Christmas Day]], when the character [[Archie Mitchell]], played by [[Larry Lamb (actor)|Larry Lamb]], was murdered by an unseen person. Events leading up to and following the murder put several characters in the frame, in the style of a [[whodunnit]] mystery. The culprit was kept a tight secret within the production crew as well, with only seven people knowing the identity of the killer. The murderer was revealed as [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) during a [[Live television#Live television episodes|live episode]] titled "[[EastEnders Live]]", broadcast on 19 February 2010, the show's [[History of EastEnders#2010s|25th anniversary]]. Turner was told thirty minutes before the broadcast that Stacey was the killer, and actors rehearsed several possible endings. Finally, a two-hander episode between Stacey and Max on 26 March 2010 explained how she killed Archie.

==Storyline creation and development==
[[File:Queen Victoria, EastEnders.jpg|right|thumb|Archie Mitchell was murdered inside The Queen Victoria.]]

The storyline was created in spring 2009 during a story conference, where executive producer [[Diederick Santer]], storyliner [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]], series consultant and lead writer [[Simon Ashdown]], series producer Lorraine Newman, script producer Sharon Batten, and Controller of BBC Drama Production [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]]<ref name="aftermath">{{Cite episode |title=EastEnders Live: The Aftermath |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00qym8y |series=EastEnders Documentaries |serieslink=List of EastEnders television spin-offs |credits=[[George Lamb (presenter)|George Lamb]] (presenter), [[Kirsten O'Brien]] (presenter), Claire Popplewell (director)|network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC Three]] |airdate=19 February 2010 |minutes= |quote= }}</ref> were considering what to do for the Christmas Day 2009 and 25th anniversary episodes. They discussed the character Archie Mitchell and how everyone hated him, and decided on a storyline with characters' hatred and anger towards Archie building up before Christmas, with a peak on Christmas Day when he is killed and another for the reveal on the 19 February 2010 anniversary. They decided to keep the killer's identity a secret within the small group and decided to reveal it during a live episode so that the secret could be kept for as long as possible,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/twentyfive/diederick.shtml|title=Who Killed Archie?

The moment Turner was told Stacey was the killer was filmed for a live reaction show broadcast immediately after "EastEnders Live" on [[BBC Three]]. ''[[List of EastEnders television spin-offs#Other documentaries|EastEnders Live: The Aftermath]]'' was presented by Lamb's son [[George Lamb (presenter)|George]] and included other behind-the-scenes material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a204050/eastenders-killer-reaction-to-be-filmed.html|title='EastEnders' killer reaction to be filmed|last=Green|first=Kris|date=19 February 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=19 February 2010}}</ref> Turner received a call to see Santer about 20 minutes before the broadcast, where she was told that Stacey was the killer.

==Suspects and motives==
[[File:Adam Woodyatt.jpg|thumb|left|Woodyatt said it would have been plausible if his character Ian had been the murderer.]]
There were officially ten suspects for the murder,<ref name="numbers">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a203981/eastenders-live-by-numbers.html|title='EastEnders Live' by Numbers|last=Green|first=Kris|date=19 February 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=19 February 2010}}</ref> though the ten were not known to viewers or cast members, who speculated about the identity of the killer. On Christmas Eve, storylines showed Archie evicting his wife Peggy, daughters Ronnie and Roxy, Peggy's son Phil and Phil's son [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben]] ([[Charlie Jones (actor)|Charlie Jones]]) from their home, The Queen Victoria public house, after he became the landlord. Ronnie had a further motive as Archie had caused her to suffer a miscarriage and she blamed him for the death of her daughter [[Danielle Jones (EastEnders)|Danielle Jones]] ([[Lauren Crace]]) earlier in 2009.<ref name="suspects">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a191496/who-killed-archie-the-suspects-revisited.html|title='Who Killed Archie?': The Suspects Revisited|last=Green|first=Kris|date=25 December 2009|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=20 February 2010}}</ref> Peggy discovered that Archie had paid her daughter [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]) to skip bail, thus plunging the Mitchells into debt, and Sam returned on Christmas Day to discover she had been manipulated.<ref name="suspects"/> Phil was also a suspect after failing to kill Archie on Peggy's request earlier in 2009.<ref name="suspects"/> Simons explained that the killer was likely to be the most unsuspecting person, and stated that Roxy was "pretty much the only non-suspect,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/interviews/a191599/rita-simons-roxy-mitchell-eastenders.html|title=Rita Simons (Roxy Mitchell, 'EastEnders')|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=8 January 2010|accessdate=14 January 2010}}</ref> but said she felt the character would not go so far as to killer her father, even though she had seen his true colours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/01/06/i-m-just-a-wild-child-at-heart-i-can-t-help-it-115875-21945711/|title=I'm just a wild child at heart..

McDermott said his character, Ryan Malloy, "probably would have the balls to kill Archie" and it would be a possibility due to the character's past, although he accused Janine of the murder, making it unlikely unless he was "quite conniving."

==Plot==
===Events leading up the murder===
On Archie and Peggy's wedding day, the true identity of Danielle Jones as Ronnie's daughter is revealed. Archie has told Ronnie that her daughter, who he gave up for adoption as a baby, has died. Moments after Ronnie realises the truth, Danielle is hit by Janine's car and killed. Peggy throws Archie out and asks Phil to kill him, but Phil just forces him to leave.

When Archie returns, he attempts to reconcile with Peggy, but comes up with a plan to steal the Mitchells' business, The Queen Victoria public house, with Janine's help. However, Janine, along with Ryan, plans to steal it from Archie at the last minute. Peggy's daughter Sam, who has been in Brazil on the run from police due to her involvement in the murder of [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]), returns to Walford, thinking the charges have been dropped. She is subsequently arrested, and the Mitchells put up <U+00A3>250,000 bail to have her released. Archie convinces Sam to leave again, paying for her to go. Phil is then forced to take out a loan from Ian. Ian accepts, on the condition that if the loan is not paid back within a certain time, he becomes owner of The Queen Victoria. Archie and Janine learn of this and try to get Ian to sell the loan to them. When Ian's wife Jane leaves him, Janine gets him drunk and sleeps with him, making an audio recording of them together. Archie and Janine blackmail Ian into selling them the loan and he tells the Mitchells they are trespassing. Ronnie stands up to him and he pushes her into the bar, not knowing she is pregnant, though Roxy then reveals it. Ronnie has a miscarriage and Peggy tells Archie he has killed another of Ronnie's children, warning him to stay away from her. Peggy eventually hands over the keys and the family of Peggy, Phil, Ronnie, Roxy, Ben and Roxy's baby [[Amy Mitchell|Amy]] leave on 24 December 2009.

On Christmas Day, Archie tells Ian the CD of the recording is under Ian's Christmas tree for Jane, but Ian fails to find it. Archie tells Janine that they should skip Christmas dinner as he has made a surprise treasure hunt for her. Janine eventually finds an envelope containing a one-way ticket to Poland and Archie throws her out onto the street telling her he knows how she and Ryan tried to double-cross him. Archie is visited by Jack Branning who threatens to kill him if he hurts Ronnie again. Archie finds Ian searching his living room for the CD and Archie says it is on his laptop and he can make as copies at any time, threatening Ian with a phone call to Jane, before ejecting him from the pub. Sam returns and attempts to confront Archie but he shuts the door on her. Ronnie then arrives and tells him with no emotion that he will not make her care for him and she would not care if he died. Archie throws her out onto the street reminding her that it was the exact spot she pushed Danielle onto the night she died.

Archie is visited by Peggy and he pleads with her to come home to him as she is the woman he loves. Peggy says she is not just a sweet and innocent old lady and that he has no idea who he is messing with. She tells Archie if he does not leave the pub that night he will regret every cruel and evil act he has ever done. He tells her that unless she returns he will have the pub converted to flats. He then becomes emotional as he tells Peggy that he will be waiting for her as she walks out on him. Bradley walks in and punches Archie in the face twice but accidentally punches the bar as well, cutting his hand. He tells Archie to stay away from his girlfriend Stacey because she has said Archie raped her three months previously, and Bradley leaves. As Archie picks up his snowglobe from the floor, Stacey pushes the bust of Queen Victoria from the bar, and it hits him over the head.

===After the murder===
Ronnie finds Archie on the floor of The Queen Victoria and he apologises to her before he dies. When the police are notified of the death they arrest Ronnie, but later release her without charge. [[Jill Marsden|DCI Jill Marsden]] ([[Sophie Stanton]]) investigates the rest of the Mitchell family. Phil is given a false alibi by his friend [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), who finds a blood-stained shirt amongst his belongings. Phil explains that he found Archie dead and lost his balance, falling into the blood, but did not call the police because he panicked. They burn the shirt, and when Marsden visits them again, asking to see the clothes Phil was wearing at Christmas, Shirley produces a freshly laundered one. Shirley's flatmate [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Ferguson]]) reveals that Phil was not really with Shirley on Christmas Day, prompting Shirley to make an anonymous call stating she saw Janine enter The Queen Victoria on the day of the murder, deflecting suspicion from Phil. Peggy and Phil attempt to pin the murder on Sam, who retaliates by blaming Peggy. Both are questioned by Marsden at the police station, and though Peggy is released without charge, Sam is arrested for breaking her bail.

Ian has Archie's laptop, and though he deletes the audio file of him and Janine from it, it later comes to light, and he and Jane throw the laptop into the canal. Janine attempts to blackmail Ian, and when he rebuffs her, she tells the police about the recording and the laptop, leading to his arrest. Ian admits to stealing the laptop from The Queen Victoria on Christmas Day, but denies murder. The police charge him with murder, but when Janine admits the truth, the charges are dropped.

Marsden and her colleague [[Wayne Hughes (EastEnders)|DC Wayne Hughes]] ([[Jamie Treacher]]) attend Archie's funeral, but do not see Stacey spit on Archie's grave. Jack, a former police officer, tells Hughes he can help out with any "local information" they might need. Jack later learns that Archie raped Stacey, that she is now pregnant with Archie's baby, and that Bradley punched him on Christmas Day. Jack urges Bradley to tell the police what he did, desiring to keep Ronnie out of trouble. Marsden reveals she has a new forensic profile and a DNA screening process will begin. She asks all white males to volunteer for DNA screening, and when Bradley complies, Jack bribes Hughes to make the samples disappear. 

A ring Roxy inherited from Archie, which went missing at Christmas, is planted in Janine's flat. Marsden receives an anonymous tip-off and Janine is arrested after the ring is found in her teapot. She is interviewed, but is released due to lack of evidence. She realises that Peggy planted the ring in an attempt to frame her. When Shirley thinks Phil is seeing another woman, she tells him she is only interested in her for her alibi. He says it is not true, but she drunkenly threatens to withdraw the alibi, and walks to the police station. Roxy accuses Ronnie of murdering Archie. Ronnie denies it, but tells her that Archie once raped her. Peggy tells the two of them that when Archie was murdered, she found him lying on the floor, took her divorce papers from the bar and left him to die. Phil tells Peggy about his alibi, the shirt and that he found Archie dead on Christmas Day. Shirley then returns and says Phil has got away with it as she has not told the police anything.

Jack receives a call from Hughes to say that Bradley is about to be arrested and urges Bradley to leave Walford as quickly as possible. Bradley and Stacey quickly pack their bags at home. Max says an emotional goodbye to his son and Jack agrees to help them escape. They leave via the back door as Max delays the police at the front, and hide a few streets away. Jack also leaves by the back door but Marsden sees him and he is unable to meet Bradley and Stacey, who are nervously waiting. Bradley says they should go without Jack, but when they go to get a taxi, Bradley realises he has left the passports at home and goes back to get them, leaving Stacey to wait. However, Stacey grows impatient and phones him. The police notice him when his phone rings, and in a bid to escape them, he runs up a fire escape and crawls across the roof of The Queen Victoria with an officer following him. He shouts at Stacey to run, but stumbles and falls backwards from the roof to his death. Max and Stacey are devastated, and he pulls her away from the body. She tells him it is her fault, as Bradley did not kill Archie, she did. The following day, Marsden says the police will no longer be pursuing the investigation. Stacey then goes missing, and on the day of Bradley's funeral, Jack receives news that a court has found Bradley guilty of Archie's murder.

Max tracks down Stacey to a flat where Stacey explains that she was angry at Archie and was worried about what Bradley would do to him after he found out about the baby. A minute after Bradley confronted Archie, she found Archie on the floor and pushed the bust onto his head. Max eventually tells Stacey that nobody else needs to know that she killed Archie and sends her home.
