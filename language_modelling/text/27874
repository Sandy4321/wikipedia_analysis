'''Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami''' (born in California, 1942), a [[Hindu]] [[sannyasin|monk]], is the head of Kauai's Hindu Monastery and publisher of [[Hinduism Today]] magazine. Bodhinatha presides over three organizations: [[Saiva Siddhanta Church]], Himalayan Academy publications and Hindu Heritage Endowment.

Bodhinatha is the appointed successor of Satguru [[Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]], who was an influential [[Hindu]] [[Saivite]] [[guru]] lauded by [[Klaus Klostermaier]] as "the single-most advocate of Hinduism outside India".<ref>[[Klaus Klostermaier]], one of the world's leading specialists on Hindu studies, said in his ''A Survey of Hinduism: "Sivaya Subramuniyaswami ... did much to propagate a kind of reformed Saivism through his books. As founder-editor of ''Hinduism Today,'' an illustrated monthly, he became the single-most advocate of Hinduism outside India." -- A Survey of Hinduism, 3rd. edition, page 251</ref> He ordained Bodhinatha as leader of [[Saiva Siddhanta Church]] and 163rd Guru Mahasannidhanam of the [[Kailasa]] [[Parampara]] lineage,<ref name="gurudeva1">http://www.gurudeva.org/satgurus/bodhinatha/</ref> a position of authority in [[Saivism]].<ref>"Hinduism does not have an organised hierarchy but to followers of the Saiva tradition of Hinduism Sri Bodhinatha is a pope-like figure."

Bodhinatha Veylanswami was a keynote speaker at Hindu Convocation of the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in Melbourne, Australia, an "assembly of a number of the most outstanding Hindu spiritual leaders of India."<ref>[http://www.parliamentofreligions.org/index.cfm?n=7&sn=11 PROGRAM / Convocation of Spiritual Leaders of India | Council for a Parliament of the World's Religions]</ref> He mediated the seminal "Is Yoga Hindu?" session at the Parliament on December 2009,<ref>[http://blogs.abc.net.au/religion/2009/12/is-yoga-hindu.html ABC Religion Blog Is yoga Hindu?]</ref> which sparked the [[Hindu American Foundation]]'s "Take Back Yoga " campaign in 2010.

Bodhinatha is a popular speaker with Hindus, specially those of the Hindu diaspora living in the United States, Malaysia, Mauritius and Singapore. The "Indo-American News" wrote, "Bodhinatha is a formidable force in championing the cause of Hinduism. Soft-spoken yet imbued with immense knowledge and a keen wit, the satguru is a sought-after speaker the world over."<ref>http://www.indoamerican-news.com/IndoAmericanNews/091109/091109A1-14-WEB.pdf</ref>

== Biography ==
Bodhinatha began studying Vedanta and meditation in 1960, soon developing a deep interest in monastic life. In March, 1972, he received [[sannyas]] [[diksha]] from [[Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]] in Alaveddy, Sri Lanka. He received the name Veylanswami a few weeks later at the Murugan Temple in Palani Hills.<ref name="gurudeva1"/>

In 1988, in preparation for initiation as an [[acharya]] in the [[Saiva Siddhanta Church|Saiva Siddhanta Yoga Order]], Bodhinatha spent six months on pilgrimage in India with a sadhaka, spending time worshiping and meditating at ashrams and temples from as far north as Rishikesh to Tiruchendur in the South. Upon returning to Kauai, he was ordained as the first acharya of the religious order.<ref name="gurudeva1"/>

From 1993 Bodhinatha managed the formation and development of Hindu Heritage Endowment, a tax-exempt endowment that provides income to several Hindu initiatives and institutions across the world. There are over 80 individual funds within Hindu Heritage Endowment, which together exceed $10 million.<ref>[http://www.hheonline.org/Gurudeva_HHE_Intro.shtml Endowment Stories]</ref>

On October 21, 2001, the tenth evening of Subramuniaswami's 32-day [[prayopavesha]] fast, he asked Bodhinatha to come to his bedside which all the monks had gathered around. He sent for his aadheenakartar pendant, the symbol of the spiritual head of Kauai Aadheenam, then placed it on Bodhinatha's neck, declaring, "You are the guru now."<ref name="gurudeva1"/>
