A '''Gomco clamp''' is a specialized clamp for performing [[circumcision]]s. Gomco stands for the ''GOldstein Medical COmpany'' and invented the Gomco clamp on the earlier successes of the Yellen clamp.  

==Method==
* [[Anesthetic]] should be applied (though it is a historically recent addition, dating only to approximately the early 1990s).
* The [[foreskin]] is separated from the [[glans penis|glans]]. To do this, a [[dorsal slit]] in the foreskin is frequently employed.
* The bell of the Gomco clamp is placed over the glans, and the foreskin is pulled over the bell. 
* The base of the Gomco clamp is placed over the bell, and the Gomco clamp's arm is fitted.
* After the surgeon confirms correct fitting and placement (and the amount of foreskin to be excised), the nut on the Gomco clamp is tightened, causing the clamping of nerves and blood flow to the foreskin. 
* The Gomco clamp is left in place for about five minutes to allow clotting to occur, then the foreskin is severed using a scalpel.
* The Gomco's base and bell are then removed, allowing for bandaging of the penis. 

==Advantages==
* Arguably the archetypal bloodless circumcision technique. 
* The circumcision is relatively quick compared to the more recent [[Plastibell]].
* The physician performing the circumcision supervises at every step involving a utensil.
* The [[circumcision scar]] is an extremely predictable and uniform brown ring which is visible on virtually all American men born between 1950 and 1980. 

==Disadvantages==
* Involves several small parts which all must be sterile for the safety of the patient. 
* Procedure takes longer than the traditional [[Jewish Shield]] or [[Mogen Clamp]] techniques.

==Prevalence==
Probably over 75% of circumcised American men born between 1950 and 1980 were circumcised with a Gomco clamp or a variant. The presence of a light brown ring, typically one inch behind the corona, probably indicates a Gomco circumcision. 

==Adult circumcision==
