The '''1932 San Ciprian hurricane''' was a powerful [[Atlantic]] [[tropical cyclone]] that struck [[Puerto Rico]] during the [[1932 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The ninth tropical cyclone, fourth hurricane and third major hurricane of the 1932 season,<ref name="unisys">{{cite web|author=Unisys|year=1932|title=1932 Unisys Archive|accessdate=2007-04-12|url=http://weather.unisys.com/hurricane/atlantic/1932/index.html| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070311122640/http://weather.unisys.com/hurricane/atlantic/1932/index.html| archivedate= 11 March 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> the San Ciprian Hurricane formed on September 25 east of the [[Leeward Islands]] and moved due west where it quickly gained hurricane strength a day later. After peaking as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 4 storm]], the hurricane crossed the entire length of [[Puerto Rico]] at Category&nbsp;4 strength. The hurricane later struck the [[Dominican Republic]] as a Category&nbsp;1 storm. Weakened by its three landfalls, the storm continued to trek westward as a weak tropical storm before making its fourth and fifth landfalls in [[Belize]] and mainland [[Mexico]]. The storm then dissipated on October 3.<ref name="unisys"/>

The San Ciprian Hurricane took an unusual east to west path across [[Puerto Rico]], producing damage across the entire length of the [[United States territory]]. The next storm to follow a similar path was [[Hurricane Georges]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|author=Shawn P.

The hurricane also caused moderate damage in the [[Virgin Islands]].<ref name="mwr">{{cite web|author=W.J.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|1932 Atlantic hurricane 9 track.png}}
A possible [[tropical cyclone|Cape Verde-type hurricane]], the San Ciprian storm was detected by ships as a tropical storm on September 25.<ref name="unisys"/> A strong high pressure system to the north kept the storm moving due west. It reached hurricane strength hours later as it passed the islands of [[Antigua]] and [[St. Barthelemy]] at 3 p.m. On September 26, the hurricane passed through the rest of the [[Leeward Islands]] as it gained strength.<ref name="unisys"/><ref name="mwr"/> During its journey, the hurricane quickly strengthened to Category&nbsp;4 status and its winds peaked at 145&nbsp;mph (230&nbsp;km/h).<ref>{{cite web|author=NOAA|year=2007|title=HURDAT re-analysis of 1932 San Ciprian Hurricane|accessdate=2007-04-13|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/easy_1931-40.htm#1932_7}}</ref> At 10 p.m., the hurricane made landfall near [[Ceiba, Puerto Rico|Ceiba]], with the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] passing directly over the Ensenada Honda harbor. After striking [[Puerto Rico]], the storm continued westward where it made its second landfall near [[Santo Domingo]] on September 27. The storm weakened as it crossed into [[Haiti]] as a tropical storm.<ref name="mwr"/> After impacting [[Hispaniola]], the storm continued westward where it brushed past [[Jamaica]] to the south.<ref name="unisys"/> On October 1, the tropical storm made landfall in [[Belize]] (then known as British Honduras) and crossed over the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] before making its final landfall near [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], [[Mexico]]. It dissipated on October 3.<ref name="mwr"/>

Forecasters at the [[United States Weather Bureau]] issued [[tropical cyclone watches and warnings]] for the islands of [[St. Kitts and Nevis]] and [[St. Martin]].<ref>{{cite web|author=The Circleville Herald|year=1932|title=Warns of Storms|accessdate=2007-04-17|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=25977664&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=0&currentPage=0}}</ref>
In [[Puerto Rico]], forecasters began to issue warnings on September 26,<ref name="mwr"/> and [[police]] and municipality leaders were notified of the storm's approach. The Governor of [[Puerto Rico]] called an emergency meeting with the territories' police chief, the general of the National Guard, Commissioner of Health, and other officials to discuss the preparation for the storm and what actions must be taken after the storm passes.<ref name="pr">{{cite web|author=James R.

In the [[Dominican Republic]], the hurricane's approach triggered fears of a second disaster as that country was still recovering from the destruction by the [[1930 Dominican Republic Hurricane]] two years earlier.<ref name="sdh">{{cite web|author=Syracuse Herald|year=1932|title=San Domingo and Haiti in the storms path|accessdate=2007-04-18|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=51364509&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=0&currentPage=0}}</ref> The concern prompted residents to close businesses and evacuate; some sought to nearby churches for shelter.<ref name="tvm">{{cite web|author=United Press|year=1932|title=Long Trail of death and damage left by the storm|publisher=The Vidette-Messenger|accessdate=2007-04-18|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=56650985&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=0&currentPage=10}}</ref> In [[Jamaica]], meteorologists forecast the storm to move north of the island after passing over [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]].

==Impact==
The impact of the San Ciprian Hurricane was the worst [[Puerto Rico]] (including [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]) has seen since the [[1928 Okeechobee Hurricane]].<ref name="hnp"/> Damage from the 1932 hurricane also occurred in areas that escaped damage from the 1928 storm. Damage from the 1932 hurricane affected 49 municipalities in [[Puerto Rico]].<ref name="pr"/>

===Virgin Islands===
Weather stations in [[St. Croix]] and [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] reported 60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) winds and barometric pressures ranging from 1000 to 1001 [[bar (unit)|mbar]] (29.52 to 29.55 [[inHg]]).<ref name="mwr"/> The storm caused moderate damage in the [[Virgin Islands]] as heavy seas sank or heavily damaged small boats and ships in [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]].<ref name="hnp"/> The [[New York Times]] reported that the hurricane killed 15 people in the [[Virgin Islands]].<ref>{{cite news|author=New York Times|title=SAN JUAN DAMAGED BADLY|accessdate=2007-04-25|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00D1FFC3A5516738DDDA10A94D1405B828FF1D3 | work=The New York Times | date=1932-09-28}}</ref>

===Puerto Rico===
In [[Puerto Rico]], the hurricane produced heavy rainfall and two ships reported barometric pressures of 938 to 948&nbsp;mbar (27.70 to 27.99&nbsp;inHg).

Offshore, the rough seas brought by the hurricane caused heavy damage to shipping as the [[storm surge]] caused two boats to run aground near [[Ceiba, Puerto Rico|Ceiba]]. In San Juan, two more boats sustained severe damage. The storm surge and high winds also damaged or destroyed several warehouses.<ref name="mwr"/> Elsewhere in [[Puerto Rico]], the damage was even more severe as the hurricane's high winds destroyed many homes in outlying villages killing 109 people. The highest death toll came from the town of [[Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico|Rio Piedras]] which was directly in the path of the hurricane and many of the homes were in poor condition to withstand the hurricane's winds.<ref>{{cite web|author=Associated Press|year=1932|title=San Juan is Lashed Hard During Night|publisher=The Daily Times News|accessdate=2007-03-23|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=10773328&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=0&currentPage=10}}</ref> Damage to roads, power lines, and roads<ref name="pr"/> disrupted communications and access to the interior portion of [[Puerto Rico]].<ref name="ony">{{cite web|author=United Press|year=1932|title=Puerto Rico Swept By Extremely Forceful storm|publisher=Times Evening Herald|accessdate=2007-04-23|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=38738778&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=2&currentPage=10}}</ref> Heavy rainfall from the hurricane caused significant flooding that left many homes and buildings under 1.5&nbsp;feet (0.4&nbsp;meter) of water.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Port Arthur News|year=1932|title=Gulf Storm Looses Fury|accessdate=2007-04-25|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=44050563&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=8&currentPage=0}}</ref>
