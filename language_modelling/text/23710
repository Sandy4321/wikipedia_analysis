'''Arthur Berckmans''' (born [[May 3]], [[1929]]), better known as '''Berck''', is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[comics]] author, best known for ''[[Sammy]]''. 

==Biography==
Arthur Berckmans was born in [[Leuven]] in 1929.<ref name=Weyer>De Weyer, Geert (2005). "Berck". In Belgi<U+00EB> gestript, pp. 91-92. Tielt: Lannoo.</ref> He studied drawing at the [[Art academy]] of Leuven and at the [[Saint Lucas Institute]] in [[Brussels]]. His first job as an illustrator was in 1948 for the [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[Jesuit]] magazine ''Pro Apostolis''. He also illustrated some youth novels, and started to work at PubliArt, a publicity division of [[Le Lombard]], where he made many drawings and a few publicitary comics, appearing in many Belgian newspapers and magazines. 

In 1958, Berck was asked by ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin magazine]]'' to collaborate with [[Ren<U+00E9> Goscinny]] on a new comical series, ''Strapontin''. The series became a moderate success, and Berck created a few other series for the magazine, the most notable being ''Rataplan''.<ref name=Weyer/> 

In the meantime, he also started working for ''Zonneland'', the youth magazine of [[Altiora Averbode]], the editor of the abbey of [[Averbode]]. In later years, he contributed to ''Sjors'', one of the major [[Netherlands|Dutch]] comics magazines, where he created the series ''Lowietje''.

But his main breakthrough came when he worked for ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou magazine]]''. His first series, ''Mulligan'', did not make much of an impact, but when he teamed up with [[Raoul Cauvin]] for ''[[Sammy]]'', a series about an unlikely pair of bodyguards in Chicago at the time of [[Al Capone]] and [[Eliot Ness]], he quickly became one of the more popular artists of the magazine, and the albums got impressive sales. Berck ceased his work on all other series to focus solely on ''Sammy''. 

In 1994, Berck announced that he would retire. While this is usual in Belgium at the age of 65, it was an almost unprecedented move for a comics artist. ''Sammy'' was continued by the experienced artist [[Jean-Pol]].<ref name=Weyer/>
