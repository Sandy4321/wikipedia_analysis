'''Ellen Cicely Wilkinson''' [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]] (8 October 1891 <U+2013> 6 February 1947) was a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician  who served as [[Department for Education|Minister of Education]] from July 1945 until her death. As the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Jarrow (UK Parliament constituency)|Jarrow]], she became a national figure when, in 1936, she led the [[Jarrow March]] of the town's unemployed  to London, to petition for the right to work. Although unsuccessful at the time, the march provided an iconic image for the 1930s, and helped to form  post-Second World War attitudes to unemployment and social justice.

Wilkinson was born into a poor though ambitious Manchester family, and   embraced socialism at an early age.  After graduating from  the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] she worked for a [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] organisation and later as a trade union officer. Inspired by the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, Wilkinson joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|British Communist Party]], and preached revolutionary socialism while seeking constitutional routes to political power through the Labour Party. She was elected Labour MP for [[Middlesbrough East (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesbrough East]] in 1924, and supported the  [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 General Strike]].  In the 1929<U+2013>31 Labour government she served as [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the junior [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Health Minister]]. Following her defeat at Middlesbrough in 1931, Wilkinson became a prolific journalist and writer  before returning to parliament as Jarrow's MP in 1935. She was a strong advocate for the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican faction]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]], and made several visits to the battle zones.

During the Second World War Wilkinson served in [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]]'s [[Churchill war ministry|wartime coalition]] as a [[Parliamentary Secretary|junior minister]], mainly   at the [[Ministry of Home Security]] where she worked under [[Herbert Morrison]]. She supported Morrison's attempts to replace [[Clement Attlee]] as the Labour Party's leader; nevertheless, when he formed his postwar government Attlee appointed Wilkinson as [[Secretary of State for Education|Minister of Education]]. By this time her health was poor, the legacy of years of overwork. She saw her main task in office as the implementation of the wartime coalition's [[Education Act 1944|1944 Education Act]], rather than the more radical introduction of [[Comprehensive school (England and Wales)|comprehensive schools ]] favoured by many in the Labour Party. Much of her energy was applied to organising the raising of the school leaving age from 14 to 15. In the exceptionally cold English winter of 1946<U+2013>47 she succumbed to a bronchial disease, and died after an overdose of medication which the coroner at her inquest declared was accidental.

Ellen Wilkinson was born on 8 October 1891, at 41 Coral Street in the Manchester district of [[Chorlton-on-Medlock]].<ref>Bartley, p. 1</ref> She was the third child and second daughter of Richard Wilkinson, a cotton worker who became an insurance agent, and his wife, Ellen, n<U+00E9>e Wood.<ref name= odnbW>{{cite web|last= Harrison|first= Brian|title= Wilkinson, Ellen Cicely|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36902?docPos=1|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online edition|accessdate=3 October 2014}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> Richard Wilkinson  was a pillar of his local Methodist church, and combined a strong sense of social justice with forthright views on self-help; rather than espousing working-class solidarity  his view, according to Ellen, was: "I have pulled myself out of the gutter, why can't they?"<ref>Wilkinson  1938, p. 402</ref>   Entirely self-educated, he ensured that his children received the best schooling available, encouraged them to read widely, and inculcated strong Christian principles.<ref>Bartley, p. 2</ref><ref name= V4>Vernon, pp. 4<U+2013>5</ref>

At the age of six Ellen began attending what she described as "a filthy elementary school with the five classes in one room".<ref>Wilkinson  1938, p. 407</ref> A series of childhood illnesses  kept her at home for two years, but she used the time by learning  to read.<ref>Wilkinson  1938, p. 403</ref> On her return to school she made rapid progress, and  at the age of 11 she won a scholarship to Ardwick Higher Elementary Grade School.<ref>Vernon, p. 6</ref> Outspoken and often rebellious,<ref name= J19>Jackson, p. 19</ref> after two years she transferred to Stretford Road Secondary School for Girls, an experience she later remembered as "horrid and unmanageable".<ref name= B3>Bartley, pp. 3<U+2013>4</ref> She made up for the school's shortcomings by reading, with her father's encouragement, the works of [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]].<ref>Wilkinson 1938, p. 405</ref>

Teaching was one of the few careers then open to educated working-class girls, and in 1906 Ellen won a bursary of <U+00A3>25 that enabled her to begin training at the Manchester Pupil Teacher's Centre. For half the week she attended the Manchester Day Training College, and during the other half taught at Oswald Road Elementary School. Her classroom approach<U+2014>she sought to interest her pupils, rather than impose learning by rote<U+2014>led to frequent clashes with her superiors, and convinced her that her future did not lie in teaching.<ref>Vernon, pp. 7<U+2013>8</ref><ref>Wilkinson 1938, p. 408</ref> At the college, where she was encouraged to read more widely and to engage with the issues of the day, she discovered socialism through the works of [[Robert Blatchford]]. By this time she was impatient with religion;  socialism provided an attractive substitute.<ref>Jackson, p. 24</ref> At 16 she joined the Longsight branch of  the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP), and at one of her first branch meetings encountered [[Katherine Glasier|Katherine Bruce Glasier]], whose crusading brand of socialism made a deep impact.<ref name= B3/> Thirty years later Wilkinson told her colleague [[George Middleton (British politician)|George Middleton]] that Glasier had "brought me into the Socialist movement&nbsp;... It always makes me humble to think of her indomitable courage".<ref>Letter from Wilkinson to Middleton, quoted by Bartley, p. 5</ref> After meeting the suffragist [[Hannah Mitchell]], Wilkinson took up the cause of [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]],   the major women's rights issue of the day. Although initially engaged in everyday tasks such as distributing leaflets  and putting up posters,<ref>Vernon, p. 23</ref><ref name= Debs/> she made  a considerable impression on Mitchell, who later remembered her as "brilliant and gifted".<ref>Mitchell, p. 193</ref>

====University====
[[File:Universtity Of Manchester Whitworth Hall.jpg| thumb|Whitworth Hall, Manchester University's Oxford Road building]]
Determined to carve a career for herself outside teaching, in 1910  Wilkinson won a place at [[Victoria University of Manchester|Manchester University]]  by means of  the Jones Open History Scholarship.<ref>Vernon, p. 9</ref> There, she   found many opportunities to extend her political activities. She joined the university's branch of the [[Fabian Society]], and eventually became its joint secretary.<ref name= Debs>Debenham, pp. 221<U+2013>24</ref>  She continued her suffragist work by joining the Manchester Society for Women's Suffrage, where she impressed [[Margaret Ashton]], the  first woman member of Manchester City Council, by her efforts in the North Manchester and Gorton constituencies.<ref name= V40>Vernon, p. 40</ref> Through these and other campaigning activities Wilkinson met many of the contemporary leaders of the radical left<U+2014>the veteran campaigner [[Charlotte Despard]], the ILP leader [[William Crawford Anderson]], and [[Beatrice Webb|Beatrice]] and [[Sidney Webb]] among others.<ref name= V28>Vernon, pp. 28<U+2013>30</ref> She also  came under the influence of [[Walton Newbold]], an older student who later became the United Kingdom's first Communist MP. The two were briefly engaged, and although this was soon broken off, they remained close political associates for many years.<ref>Vernon, pp. 33<U+2013>37</ref>

In her final year at university  Wilkinson was co-opted to the executive committee of the University Socialist Federation (USF), an inter-institutional organisation formed to bring together socialist-minded students from all over the country. This  brought her new contacts, who would typically meet at Fabian summer schools to hear lectures by ILP leaders such as [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and [[Arthur Henderson]], and trade union activists such as [[Ben Tillett]] and [[Margaret Bondfield]].  Amid these distractions she continued to study hard, and won several prizes. In the summer of 1913 she sat her finals and was awarded her BA degree<U+2014>not the [[British undergraduate degree classification|First Class]] honours that her tutors had predicted, but an Upper Second. Wilkinson rationalised thus: "I deliberately  sacrificed my First&nbsp;... to devote my spare time to a strike raging in Manchester".<ref name= V28/><ref>Cole 1938, p. 67</ref>{{#tag:ref|In June 1914, 12 months after her graduation, Wilkinson's degree was upgraded to MA. In accordance with the university's regulations at that time, no thesis or further study was required.<ref name= V28 />|group= n}}

===Early career===

====Trade union organiser====
On leaving  university in June 1913,  Wilkinson became a paid worker  for  the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS).<ref>Jackson. p. 239</ref> She helped to organise the Suffrage Pilgrimage of July 1913, when more than 50,000 women marched from all over the country to a mass rally in [[Hyde Park, London]].<ref>Bartley, p. 6</ref><ref>{{cite news|last= Cochrane|first= Kira|title= Join the great suffrage pilgrimage|url= http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2013/jul/11/join-great-suffrage-pilgrimage|newspaper= The Guardian|date= 11 July 2013}}</ref>  She began to develop a fuller understanding of the mechanics of politics and campaigning, and became an accomplished speaker, able to hold her own even in the most hostile public meetings.<ref>Bartley, p. 7</ref>

When the First World War began in August 1914, Wilkinson, like many in the Labour movement, condemned it as an imperialist exercise that would result in the deaths of millions of workers. Nevertheless, she took the role of honorary secretary of the Manchester branch of the [[Women's Emergency Corps]] (WEC), a body which found suitable war work for women volunteers.  The advent of war curtailed most suffrage activity; the NUWSS became divided between pro-war  and pro-peace factions and ultimately split, the peacemongers (including Wilkinson's Manchester branch) eventually aligning themselves with the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] (WIL).<ref>Bartley, pp. 8<U+2013>9</ref> With little suffrage activity to organise, Wilkinson looked for another job, and in July 1915 was appointed as a national organiser for the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees (AUCE), with particular responsibility for the recruitment of women into the union.<ref>Vernon, pp. 44<U+2013>46</ref> In this post she fought for equal pay for equal work, and for the rights of unskilled and lower-paid workers when these interests conflicted with those of the higher-paid craft unions.<ref>Bartley, pp. 12<U+2013>13</ref> From 1918 she served as her union's nominee on several Trade Boards<U+2014>national consultative bodies which attempted to set minimum wage rates for low-paid workers.<ref>Vernon, pp. 49<U+2013>50</ref> In 1921 AUCE amalgamated with the National Union of Warehouse and General Workers to form the [[National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers]] (NUDAW).<ref>Bartley, pp. 14<U+2013>15</ref>

Wilkinson's work for the union brought  new alliances, and useful new friendships<U+2014>including one with [[John Jagger]], the union's future president.<ref>Bartley, p. 10</ref>  She remained an active Fabian, and after the Fabian Research Department became the Labour Research Department in 1917,   served on the new body's executive committee.<ref>Vernon, pp. 59<U+2013>60</ref>   She maintained her connection with the WIL, and its  1919 conference  adopted a non-pacifist stance that justified armed struggle as a means of defeating capitalism.<ref name= B19>Bartley, pp. 19<U+2013>20</ref> After visiting  Ireland for the WIL in 1920, she  became an outspoken critic of the British government's actions there, in particular its use of the "[[Black and Tans]]"  as a paramilitary force. She called for an immediate truce and the release of republican prisoners.<ref>Vernon, p. 43</ref><ref>Leeson, pp. 88 and 179</ref>{{#tag:ref|Ireland had been in a state of formal rebellion against the British government since December 1918, when the majority of Irish MPs boycotted the Westminster parliament and convened as [[D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann]] in Dublin.

====Communism====

|salign = left|source=  Margaret Cole, describing the British Left's reactions to the March 1917 revolution in Russia, in ''Growing Up Into Revolution'' (1949)<ref>Cole  1949, p. 86</ref> }}
Along with many others in the Labour movement, Wilkinson's attitudes were radicalised by the [[Russian Revolution]]  of 1917. She saw communism as the shape of the future, and when the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) was formed in the summer of 1920,<ref name= B16>Bartley, pp. 16<U+2013>17</ref> Wilkinson was one of a group of ILP members with [[Marxism|Marxist]] leanings who became founder members.<ref>Cole 1949, p. 96</ref> For the next few years the CPGB was the main focus of her political activity, although she kept her membership in the Labour Party, which at the time accepted dual CPGB/Labour memberships.<ref name= B23>Bartley, pp. 23<U+2013>25</ref>

In 1921  Wilkinson attended the Red Trade Union International Congress in Moscow,<ref name=V62>Vernon, pp. 62<U+2013>63</ref> where she met several [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leaders, including the Defence Minister [[Leon Trotsky]], and [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]], the educationist who was [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s wife; Wilkinson considered Krupskaya's speech the best at the Congress.<ref name= B16/> The main outcome of the gathering was the foundation of the [[Profintern|Red International of Labour Unions]], often known as the "Profintern". The aim of this organisation was to seek revolutionary change through industrial action, leading to the overthrow of world capitalism.<ref>Bartley, p. 18</ref> At home, although she failed to persuade her union, NUDAW, to affiliate to the Profintern,<ref name= V62/> Wilkinson continued to promote Russian achievements, especially its emancipation of women workers.<ref name= B19/> In November 1922, at a meeting celebrating the fifth anniversary of the Russian Revolution, Wilkinson said that the Russian people could look forward with hope, and asked whether the same could be said of the people condemned to live their lives in the slums of Manchester.<ref>{{cite news|title= Communism in Manchester|url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/476668095/5840BA3801B143B3PQ/2?accountid=17321|newspaper= The Manchester Guardian|date= 6 November 1922|page= 11}}</ref>

====Seeking elective office====
Wilkinson was an early and lifetime supporter of the [[National Council of Labour Colleges]], established in 1921 with NUDAW backing with the aim of educating working-class students in working-class principles.<ref>Vernon, pp. 57<U+2013>58</ref><ref>{{cite journal|authorlink= Syd Bidwell|last= Bidwell|first= Syd|title= National Council of Labour Colleges|url= https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/1963/no012/bidwell.htm|journal= International Socialism|issue= 12|date= Spring 1953|page= p. 25}}</ref>   She became a NUDAW-sponsored parliamentary candidate, and in 1923, while still a CPGB member, sought  nomination as the Labour Party's parliamentary candidate for the [[Manchester Gorton (UK Parliament constituency)|Gorton]] constituency.<ref name= B23/>  She was unsuccessful, but in November 1923 the Gorton ward  elected her to [[Manchester City Council]];<ref name= odnbW/> Hannah Mitchell, her co-worker in prewar suffrage campaigns, was a fellow councillor.<ref>Mitchell, p. 206</ref> In her short council career<U+2014>she served only until 1926<ref name= odnbW/><U+2014>Wilkinson's main areas of concern were unemployment, housing, child welfare and education.<ref name= B23/>

When the prime minister, [[Stanley Baldwin]], called a [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|general election]] for December 1923, Wilkinson  was adopted as Labour's parliamentary candidate for [[Ashton-under-Lyne (UK Parliament constituency)|Ashton-under-Lyne]].<ref name= B23/> She made no secret  of her Communist affiliations, stating that "we shall have only one class in this country, the working class".<ref>{{cite news|title= News report|newspaper= Ashton-Under-Lyne Reporter|date= 1 December 1923|page= 5}}</ref> In a   three-way contest she came third,   behind the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]  and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]  candidate.<ref name = V240>Vernon, pp. 240<U+2013>41</ref> The general election resulted in a [[hung parliament]], and a [[First MacDonald ministry|minority Labour government]] under Ramsay MacDonald took office.<ref>Blythe, p. 278</ref> During its short term in power, the Labour Party proscribed the Communist Party and outlawed dual membership.<ref name= B23/> Faced with a choice, Wilkinson left the CPGB, citing the party's "exclusive and dictatorial methods which make impossible the formation of a real left wing among the progressives of the Trade Unions and the Labour Party".<ref>Vernon, p. 64</ref>  After this, she was selected as Labour's candidate for the constituency of [[Middlesbrough East (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesbrough East]].<ref name= B26>Bartley, pp. 26<U+2013>27</ref>

During the nine days' duration of the May 1926 [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|General Strike]], Wilkinson toured the country to press the strikers' case at meetings and rallies. She was devastated when the [[Trades Union Congress]] called off the strike. Early in June she joined [[George Lansbury]] and other leading Labour and union figures on the platform at an [[Royal Albert Hall|Albert Hall]] rally which raised around <U+00A3>1,200 for the benefit of the miners, who continued on strike despite the TUC decision.<ref>Shepherd, p. 237</ref>  Wilkinson's reflections on the strike were recorded in ''A Workers' History of the Great Strike'' (1927), which she co-authored with [[Raymond Postgate]] and [[Frank Horrabin]],<ref>Vernon, p. 88</ref> and in a semi-autobiographical novel, ''Clash'', which she published in 1929.<ref name= V4/><ref>Bartley, p. 42</ref>

Throughout her career Wilkinson was an opponent of imperialism, and in February 1927 she attended the Founding Congress of the [[League Against Imperialism]] in [[Brussels]], where  she met and befriended the Indian nationalist leader [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref>Bartley, p. 83</ref>  In 1927 she was elected to the Labour Party's National Executive, which gave her a voice in the formulation of party policy.<ref>Bartley, p. 45</ref> Her advance was noted with approval by Beatrice Webb, who saw in her a future candidate for high office<U+2014>ahead of more senior Labour women such as Margaret Bondfield and [[Susan Lawrence]].<ref>Webb, p. 133</ref>  On 29 March 1928 Wilkinson voted in the House of Commons in favour of the bill that granted the vote to all women aged 21 or over.<ref>Bartley, p. 34</ref> During the debate  she said: "[W]e are doing at last a great act of justice to the women of the country&nbsp;... just as we have [previously] opened the door to the older women, tonight we are opening it to those who are just entering on the threshold of life and in whose hands is the new life of the future country that we are going to build".<ref>{{cite journal|title=  Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Bill|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1928/mar/29/representation-of-the-people-equal#S5CV0215P0_19280329_HOC_273|journal= Hansard|date= 29 March 1928|volume=  215|pages= col. 1402<U+2013>06}}</ref>

Almost from its inception the second MacDonald administration was overwhelmed by the twin crises of rising unemployment and the world trade recession that followed the financial crash in the latter part of 1929. The Labour Party was  divided;  the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]], [[Philip Snowden, 1st Viscount Snowden|Philip Snowden]],  favoured   a strict curb on public expenditure, while others, including Wilkinson,  believed   that the problem was not over-production, but under-consumption.   The solution, she argued, lay in increasing, not squeezing, the spending power of the poorest in society.<ref>Bartley, pp. 50<U+2013>51</ref> On the issue of unemployment, Wilkinson supported [[Oswald Mosley]]'s "Memorandum", a plan for economic reconstruction and public works that was rejected by the government on the grounds of cost; Mosley  resigned from the government in protest.<ref>Skidelsky, pp. 195<U+2013>209</ref><ref>Vernon, pp. 108<U+2013>09</ref>{{#tag:ref|Mosley  left the Labour Party in February 1931 to form the [[New Party (UK)|New Party]].

The divisions in the Labour Party became more acute during 1931, as the government struggled to meet the [[May Report]]'s recommended expenditure cuts  of <U+00A3>97 million, the majority (<U+00A3>67 million) to be found from reductions in unemployment costs.<ref>Marquand, p. 609</ref>  On 23 August 1931 the government collapsed. To implement the required cuts, MacDonald and a small number of Labour MPs formed a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] with the Conservatives and Liberals, while the bulk of the Labour Party, including Wilkinson,  went into opposition.<ref>Blythe, pp. 282<U+2013>83</ref> In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|general election]] that followed in October the Labour Party was utterly routed, retaining only 52 of its parliamentary seats.<ref name= V242/> In Middlesbrough East Wilkinson's vote was nearly the same as her 1929 total, but against a single candidate representing the National Government she was defeated by over 6,000 votes.<ref name= V240/>

===Out of parliament, 1931<U+2013>35===
Wilkinson  rationalised Labour's defeat in a ''[[Daily Express]]'' article, arguing that the party had lost  because it was "not socialist enough", a theme she built on in numerous radical newspaper and journal articles.<ref name= B57>Bartley, pp. 56<U+2013>57</ref> In a less serious vein  she published ''Peep at Politicians'', a collection of humorous pen-portraits of parliamentary colleagues and opponents. She wrote that [[Winston Churchill]] was "cheerfully indifferent as to whether any new [ideas] he acquires match the collection he already possesses", and described [[Clement Attlee]] as "too fastidious for intrigue, and too modest for over-ambition".<ref>Quoted in Vernon, p. 133</ref> Her second novel, ''The Division Bell Mystery'', set in the House of Commons, was published in 1932; Paula Bartley, Wilkinson's biographer, acknowledges that Wilkinson was not a first-class novelist, but "the autobiographical topicality of [her] books made them very appealing".<ref name= B57/>

In 1932 Wilkinson was invited by  the India League to join a small delegation,  to report on conditions in India. During the three-month visit she met [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]], then in prison, and became convinced that his co-operation was essential to any prospect of peace in the subcontinent. On her return home she delivered her conclusions in an uncompromising report, ''The Condition of India'', published in 1934.<ref>Vernon, p. 107</ref> She visited Germany shortly after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] came to power in 1933, and published a pamphlet, ''The Terror in Germany'', that documented early incidents of [[Nazi]] outrage.<ref>Vernon, p. 158</ref> She collaborated with a  refugee from [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] Italy, Edward Conze, to produce a further pamphlet, ''Why Fascism?'', which argued that only through socialism could the economic causes of fascism be overcome.<ref>Vernon, pp. 136<U+2013>37</ref> Meanwhile, her parliamentary prospects had been revived by her selection as Labour candidate for [[Jarrow (UK Parliament constituency)|Jarrow]],  a [[Tyneside]] shipbuilding town.<ref>Vernon, p. 138</ref> Jarrow had been devastated early in the 1930s by the run-down and closure of   [[Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company|Palmers]] shipyard, the town's main source of employment.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|November 1935 general election]] the National Government,  led by Baldwin since MacDonald's retirement earlier that year, won convincingly, although Labour increased its House of Commons representation to 158.<ref name= V242/> Wilkinson was returned at Jarrow with a majority of 2,350.<ref name= V240/>  Although the poverty in the town was acute, there were hopes that its chronic unemployment would shortly be alleviated by the erection of a large steelworks on the  derelict shipyard site.<ref>Wilkinson 1939, pp. 172<U+2013>73</ref>   However, the scheme was opposed by the steelmasters represented by the British Iron and Steel Federation (BISF), who  thought that any increase in steel production should be handled by expanding their existing facilities.<ref>Wilkinson 1939, pp. 175 and 184<U+2013>85</ref> On 30 June 1936 Wilkinson asked [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Walter Runciman]], the responsible minister, "to induce the Iron and Steel Federation to pursue a less selfish policy than it is pursuing at present".<ref>{{cite journal|title= Iron and Steel Works, Jarrow  |url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1936/jun/30/iron-and-steel-works-jarrow#S5CV0314P0_19360630_HOC_113|journal= Hansard|date= 30 June 1936 |volume=  314|pages= col. 205<U+2013>07}}</ref> Her request was ignored, and the matter delayed indefinitely  by the appointment of a committee to consider the general development of the iron and steel industry<U+2014>a committee, a ''[[The Times|Times]]'' letter-writer noted, dominated by BISF members.<ref>Wilkinson 1939, pp. 184<U+2013>85</ref> A deputation from Jarrow's town council met Runciman to protest against the decision, but were told  that "Jarrow must find its own salvation."<ref>Vernon, p. 141</ref><ref name= W198>Wilkinson 1939, p. 198</ref>

According to Wilkinson, Runciman's dismissive phrase "kindled the town".<ref name= W198/> Under the general leadership of its chairman,  David Riley, the town council began preparations  for a demonstration in the form of a march to London to present a petition to the government.<ref name= V142>Vernon, p. 142</ref> Marches of the unemployed, generally termed "hunger marches", had been taking place since the early 1920s, often under the auspices of the communist-led [[National Unemployed Workers' Movement]]. This political dimension had associated them in the public mind with far-left propaganda.<ref>Bartley, p. 88</ref> The Jarrow council determined to organise its march  free of  political connotations, and with the backing of every section of the town.<ref name= V142/>  This did not prevent [[Hensley Henson]], the [[Bishop of Durham]], from denouncing it as "revolutionary mob pressure"  and condemning the action of  the [[Bishop of Jarrow]], who gave the march his blessing.<ref name= B89>Bartley, p. 89</ref> Even within the Labour Party,  Wilkinson  found the leadership's attitude lukewarm, fearful of possible association with revolutionary socialism.<ref name= B91>Bartley, p. 91</ref><ref>Vernon, p. 143</ref>

On 5 October 1936  a selected group of 200 set out from Jarrow Town Hall on the 282-mile march,<ref name= B89/> aiming to reach London by 3 November  for the start of  the new session of parliament.<ref>Blythe, p. 191</ref> Wilkinson did not march all the way, but joined whenever her various commitments allowed.<ref>Bartley, p. 90</ref>  At that year's Labour Party  conference, held in Edinburgh, she hoped to rouse enthusiasm  but instead heard herself condemned  for "sending hungry and ill-clad men across the country".<ref>Wilkinson 1939, p. 204</ref> This negative attitude was mirrored by some of the local parties on the route of the march; in such areas, Wilkinson recorded with irony,   the Conservatives and Liberals  saw to the marchers' needs.<ref>Wilkinson 1939, pp. 205<U+2013>06</ref> On 31 October the marchers reached London, but Baldwin refused to see them.<ref>Bartley, p. 92</ref> On  4 November, Wilkinson presented  the town's petition to the House of Commons. Signed by 11,000 citizens of Jarrow, it concluded: "The town cannot be left derelict, and therefore your Petitioners humbly pray that His Majesty's Government and this honourable House should realise the urgent need that work should be provided for the town without further delay."<ref>{{cite journal|title= Petitions, Jarrow  |url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1936/nov/04/petitions-jarrow#S5CV0317P0_19361104_HOC_2|journal= Hansard|date= 4 November 1936 |volume=  317|pages= col. 75}}</ref> In the brief discussion that followed, Runciman opined that "the unemployment position at Jarrow, while still far from satisfactory, has improved during recent months".  In reply a Labour backbencher commented that "the Government's complacency is regarded throughout the country as an affront to the national conscience".<ref>{{cite journal|title=   Jarrow  |url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1936/nov/04/jarrow#S5CV0317P0_19361104_HOC_4|journal= Hansard|date= 4 November 1936 |volume= 317  |pages= col. 76<U+2013>77}}</ref>

The marchers returned to Jarrow by train, to find their unemployment benefit reduced because they had been "unavailable for work",  had any vacancies arisen.<ref>Bartley, p. 93</ref><ref>Blythe, p. 199</ref> The historians  Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart suggest that the success of the Jarrow march lay in the future; it "helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s", and thus paved the way to social reform.<ref>Pearce and Stewart, p. 359</ref> According to Vernon,  it  planted the idea of social justice into the minds of the middle classes.  "Ironically and tragically," Vernon says, "it was not peaceful crusading, but the impetus of rearmament which brought industrial activity back to Jarrow".<ref name= V146>Vernon, pp. 146<U+2013>47</ref>  In 1939 Wilkinson published an account of Jarrow's travails in her final book, ''The Town that was Murdered''. "Jarrow's plight", she wrote, "is not a local problem. It is the symptom of a national evil".<ref>Wilkinson 1939, p. 283</ref>

====International and domestic concerns====
A particular focus of Wilkinson's international concern was Spain.<ref>Bartley, p. 75</ref>  When a section of the army under [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]] attacked the democratically elected  [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] coalition government to precipitate the [[Spanish Civil War]], Wilkinson set up the Spanish Medical Aid Committee and the National Joint Committee for Spanish Relief.<ref>Bartley, pp. 76<U+2013>77</ref> She later argued in parliament against the  British government's non-intervention policies which, she insisted, "worked on the side of General Franco".<ref>{{cite journal|title= Spain |url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1937/may/06/spain-1#S5CV0323P0_19370506_HOC_482|journal= Hansard|date= 6 May 1937|volume= 323|pages= col.1359<U+2013>60}}</ref>  She visited Spain in April 1937 as a member of an all-women delegation led by the [[Katharine Stewart-Murray, Duchess of Atholl|Duchess of Atholl]], and afterwards wrote of feeling "a helpless, choking rage", as she witnessed the effects of aerial bombing on undefended villages.<ref>Jackson, p. 143</ref> On her second visit, in December 1937, she was accompanied by  Attlee, now leader of the Labour Party,  and [[Philip Noel-Baker]], a fellow Labour MP. Having observed the near-starvation of schoolchildren in Madrid, on her return to Britain she set up a "Milk for Spain" fund, together with other humanitarian initiatives.<ref>Bartley, pp. 79<U+2013>80</ref>

Although she had long broken her formal ties with the British Communist Party, Wilkinson retained strong links with communist organisations at home and abroad.  However, she was not prepared to risk losing her parliamentary seat, and thus kept her rebellious behaviour within bounds.<ref>Bartley, pp. 95<U+2013>96</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Collette|first=Christine|title= The Jarrow March|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/britain_wwone/jarrow_01.shtml|publisher= BBC History|date= 3 March 2011|accessdate= 19 October 2014}}</ref>  In 1937 Wilkinson was one of a group of  Labour figures<U+2014>[[Aneurin Bevan]], [[Harold Laski]] and [[Stafford Cripps]] were others<U+2014>who founded the left-wing magazine ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'';  in the first issue she wrote of the   need to fight unemployment, poverty, malnutrition and inadequate housing.<ref>Vernon, p. 171</ref>  Mindful of the dependence of many low-income families on credit, she introduced a bill to regulate [[Hire purchase|hire purchase agreements]], at the time a subject of frequent abuse, and with all-party support she secured the passage of the Hire Purchase Act 1938.<ref>Gardiner, pp. 531 and 682</ref>

Wilkinson was a strong opponent of the National Government's [[appeasement]] policies towards the European dictators. In the House of Commons on 6 October 1938 she condemned the actions of the prime minister, [[Neville Chamberlain]],{{#tag:ref|Baldwin retired as prime minister in May 1937, and Chamberlain succeeded him.<ref>Taylor, pp. 496<U+2013>97</ref>  |group= n}} in signing the [[Munich Agreement]]: "Only by throwing away practically everything for which this country cared and stood could he rescue us from the results of his own policy".<ref>{{cite journal|title= Policy of His Majesty's Government |url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1938/oct/06/policy-of-his-majestys-government#S5CV0339P0_19381006_HOC_207|journal= Hansard|date= 6 October 1938|volume=  339|pages= col. 524<U+2013>25}}</ref>  On 24 August 1939, as parliament considered the  recently-signed [[Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop Pact]], Wilkinson  attacked Chamberlain's failure to ally with Russia in a common front against Hitler. "Time after time", she told the   Commons, "we have had the prime minister&nbsp;... putting the narrow interests of his class and of the rich, before the national interest".<ref>{{cite journal|title= International Situation|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/aug/24/international-situation#S5CV0351P0_19390824_HOC_57|journal= Hansard|date= 24 August 1939|volume=  351|pages= col. 50<U+2013>55}}</ref>

===Second World War===
[[File:Blitz West End Air Shelter.jpg|thumb|Families sheltering in a London Tube station, c. 1940]]
Wilkinson  supported Britain's declaration of war on Germany, on 3 September 1939, although she was critical of Chamberlain's conduct of the war.<ref>Bartley, p. 102</ref> In May 1940, when [[Churchill war ministry|Churchill's all-party coalition]] replaced the National Government, Wilkinson was appointed Parliamentary Secretary at the [[Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance#Ministry of Pensions|Ministry of Pensions]]. In October 1940 she  transferred to the  [[Ministry of Home Security]], as one of [[Herbert Morrison]]'s three Parliamentary Secretaries, with  responsibilities for air raid shelters and [[Civil defense|civil defence]].<ref>Vernon, pp. 184<U+2013>85</ref> When aerial bombardment of British cities began in the summer of 1940, many Londoners used [[London Underground|Underground]] stations as improvised shelters, often living there for days  in conditions of increasing squalor.<ref>Vernon, pp. 185<U+2013>86</ref> By the end of 1941 Wilkinson had supervised the distribution of more than half a million indoor [[Air-raid shelter#Morrison shelter|"Morrison shelters"]]<U+2014>reinforced steel tables with wire mesh sides, under which a family could sleep at home.<ref>Vernon, p. 188</ref> Dubbed the "shelter queen" by the press, Wilkinson toured the bombed cities frequently, to share hardships and raise morale.<ref>Bartley, pp. 106<U+2013>08</ref> More controversially, she approved the conscription of women into the [[Auxiliary Fire Service]] for fire-watching duty, a policy that provoked considerable opposition  from women, who felt that their domestic duties were a sufficient burden. Even Wilkinson's own union, NUDAW, disapproved of the measure, but Wilkinson stood firm.<ref>Bartley, pp. 110<U+2013>11</ref>

The discipline of working in a ministerial post, together with the influence of Morrison, turned Wilkinson away from many of her former left-wing stances. She supported Morrison's decision in January 1941 to suppress the communist newspaper ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|The Daily Worker]]'' on the grounds of its anti-British propaganda,<ref name= B112/><ref>{{cite news|title= Suppression of Daily Worker Approved by 297 to 11|url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/484965756/EC823A6ACE594840PQ/1?accountid=17321|newspaper= The Manchester Guardian|date= 29 January 1941|page= 2}} {{subscription}}</ref> and voted for the wartime legislation that  banned strikes in key industries.<ref name= B112/>   Now accepted within the mainstream of the Labour Party, she served on several key policy committees, and in June 1943  became vice-chairman  of the party's National Executive.  She succeeded to the chair when the incumbent, [[George Ridley (Labour politician)|George Ridley]], died in January 1945.<ref>Vernon, p. 195</ref> In the 1945 [[New Year Honours]] list she was appointed a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]], only the third woman (after Margaret Bondfield and Lady Astor) to receive this honour.<ref name= B112>Bartley, pp. 112<U+2013>13</ref><ref>Vernon, p. 194</ref> In April 1945 she was part of a parliamentary delegation that travelled to San Francisco to begin work on the establishment of the [[United Nations]].<ref>Bartley, p. 116</ref>

===Postwar career===

====Leadership manoeuvres====
Wilkinson had formed a close relationship with Morrison, personally and politically, before and during their wartime ministerial association.<ref name= odnbW/> She thought that he, rather than the sedate Attlee, should be leading the Labour Party, and began openly promoting his leadership credentials.<ref>Bartley, p. 118</ref> Morrison himself informed Attlee that he intended to seek the leadership "in the interests of party unity".<ref>Jago, p. 163</ref>  In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|general election held in July 1945]]  Labour won a landslide victory,  with 393 seats against the Conservatives' 213.<ref>Bartley, p. 119</ref> This did not prevent Wilkinson and others from continuing to press for a change of leader, but Attlee forestalled further action by quickly accepting [[George VI|the king's]] invitation to form a government. He showed no resentment towards either Morrison or Wilkinson; the former was appointed [[Lord President of the Council]] and deputy prime minister, while Wilkinson was made  [[Department for Education|Minister of Education]], with a seat in the cabinet. [[Emmanuel Shinwell]], who became [[Minister of Fuel and Power]], later commented that "it is not bad tactics to make one's enemies one's servants".<ref>Vernon, pp. 196<U+2013>98</ref><ref>Bartley, p. 121</ref>

====Minister of Education====
Wilkinson  was the second woman, after Margaret Bondfield, to achieve a place in the British cabinet.<ref>{{cite conference|last1=Cracknell|first1= Richard|last2= Keen|first2= Richard|title= Women in Parliament and Government|url=  |publisher= House of Commons Library|date= 17 July 2014|page=  7}}</ref> As Minister of Education she saw as her main task the implementation of the [[Education Act 1944|1944 Education Act]]  passed by the wartime coalition.<ref>Bartley, pp. 123<U+2013>24</ref>   This Act provided universal free secondary education, and raised the minimum school leaving age  from 14 to 15  with effect from 1947. All children would take an examination<U+2014>the [[Eleven plus exam|"11-plus"]]<U+2014>which would determine whether their secondary education would be in a grammar (academic), technical or "modern" school. Many in the Labour Party  saw this tripartite arrangement as perpetuating  elitism, and  wanted a more radical scheme  based on what later became known as the "[[Comprehensive school|comprehensive]]" system. This envisaged large schools under a single roof, each with a range of appropriate courses of study for different levels of ability, and flexible movement between courses as children's aptitudes changed.<ref name= B125/><ref>Vernon, p. 203</ref> Wilkinson believed, however, that such a major reconstruction was unachievable at that time, and limited herself to more attainable reforms.<ref name= odnbW/> Her cautious attitude disappointed and angered some of the Labour left wing, who considered that a great opportunity to incorporate socialist principles into education had been missed.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Rubinstein|first= David|title= Ellen Wilkinson Re-Considered|url= http://www.jstor.org/stable/4288230|journal= History Workshop|issue= 7|date= Spring 1979|pages= pp. 161<U+2013>69}} {{subscription}}</ref>

[[File:Machanhill Primary School HORSA Huts - geograph.org.uk - 1281710.jpg|thumb|Temporary classroom huts, built to accommodate the rise in school pupils following the raising of the leaving age]]
Wilkinson made her first priority the raising of the school leaving age. This required the recruitment and training of thousands of extra teachers, and creating classroom space for almost 400,000 extra children.<ref name= B125>Bartley, pp. 125<U+2013>26</ref> Under the Emergency Training Scheme (ETS), ex-servicemen and women were given grants to train as teachers on an accelerated one-year programme; more than 37,000 had been or were being trained by the end of 1946.<ref>Vernon, pp. 207<U+2013>08</ref> The rapid expansion of school premises was   achieved by the erection of temporary huts<U+2014>some of which became long-term features of schools.<ref name= B125/> Wilkinson was determined that this reform be implemented by 1 April 1947<U+2014>the date set by the 1944 Act<U+2014>and in the face of parliamentary scepticism  insisted that her plans were on track.<ref>{{cite journal|title= School-leaving Age (Huts)|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1946/oct/31/school-leaving-age-huts#S5CV0428P0_19461031_HOC_27|journal= Hansard|date= 31 October 1946|volume= 428|pages= col. 758}}</ref>  Final cabinet approval to honour the projected date was  given on 16 January 1947.<ref>Vernon, p. 210</ref>

Other reforms during Wilkinson's tenure as minister included  free school milk, improvements in the school meals service, an increase in university scholarships,<ref name= B125/> and an expansion in the provision of part-time adult education through [[Community college#United Kingdom (excluding Scotland)|county colleges]].<ref>Vernon, pp. 215<U+2013>16</ref>   In October 1945 she went to Germany to report on how the destroyed German education system could best be reactivated.<ref name= B128>Bartley, pp. 128<U+2013>30</ref> She was astonished by the speed with which, five months after its defeat, the country's schools and universities were reopening. Other trips included visits to Gibraltar, Malta and Czechoslovakia.<ref>Vernon, pp. 211<U+2013>12</ref> In November 1945 she chaired an international conference in London that led to the establishment, a year later, of the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation]] (UNESCO).<ref name= B128/> In one of her final speeches in parliament, on 22 November 1946, she emphasised that UNESCO stood for "standards of value&nbsp;... putting aside the idea that only practical things matter". She prophesied that the organisation "will do great things", and urged the government to give it its full backing.<ref>{{cite journal|title= United Nations Educational Organisation|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1946/nov/22/united-nations-educational-organisation#S5CV0430P0_19461122_HOC_80|journal= Hansard|date= 22 November 1946|volume=  430|pages= col. 1219<U+2013>31}}</ref>

====Illness and death====
Wilkinson suffered for most of her life from bronchial asthma, which she aggravated over the years by heavy smoking and overwork.<ref name= V231/> She had often been ill during the war,<ref name= B131>Bartley, p. 131</ref>  and  had collapsed during a visit to Prague  in 1946.<ref name= V231>Vernon, pp. 231<U+2013>33</ref> On 5 January 1947 she attended the opening of the Old Vic Theatre School.<ref>Kynaston, p. 193</ref> The winter of 1946<U+2013>47 was exceptionally cold, and the   ceremony was held out of doors. Shortly afterwards, Wilkinson developed pneumonia;<ref name= B131/>   on 3 February she was found in her London flat in a coma, and on 6 February 1947 she died in St Mary's Hospital, Paddington.<ref name= V231/> At the   inquest the coroner  gave the cause of death as "heart failure following emphysema, with acute bronchitis and bronchial pneumonia, accelerated by barbiturate poisoning".<ref>{{cite news|title= Inquest verdict on Miss Wilkinson|url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/478719576/AD44E19975D54E3DPQ/5?accountid=17321|newspaper= The Manchester Guardian|date= 1 March 1947|page= 3}} {{subscription}}</ref> Wilkinson had been taking a combination of drugs for several months, to combat both her asthma and insomnia; the coroner believed she had inadvertently taken an overdose of barbiturates. With no evidence to indicate that the overdose was deliberate, he recorded a verdict of accidental death. Despite this, speculation that Wilkinson had committed suicide has persisted, one reason cited being the failure of her relationship with Morrison. In their 1973 biography of Morrison, Bernard Donoughue and G.W. Jones suggest that, given Wilkinson's poor health, the burdens of her ministerial office became too much for her. However, most historians and biographers have accepted the coroner's judgement.<ref name= V234>Vernon, pp. 234<U+2013>35</ref><ref name= B132>Bartley, pp. 132<U+2013>33</ref>

==Appraisal and legacy==
Wilkinson's short stature and distinctive red hair, combined with her uncompromising politics, gave rise to popular nicknames such as the "Fiery Particle" and "Red Ellen".<ref name= J19/><ref>Bartley, p. xi</ref> With her  bright, fashionable clothes and her forceful manner, she was easily noticeable<U+2014>an obituarist wrote that "wherever there was a row going on in support of some good or even fairly good cause, that rebellious redhead was sure to be seen bobbing about in the heart of the tumult".<ref>Ian McKay, quoted in Bartley, p. 134</ref> In her later career,  ambition and pragmatism  led her to temper her earlier Marxism and militancy and work within mainstream Labour Party policy; she came to  believe  that  parliamentary democracy offered a better route to social progress than any alternative.<ref>Bartley, p. 138</ref> Yet, Vernon says, "she never lost her resolute independence of thought, and sought power not for self glory but to succour the weak of the world".<ref name= V236>Vernon, p. 236</ref>
In a  tribute published when Wilkinson's death was announced, the former Conservative MP [[Thelma Cazalet-Keir]] summed up her personality: "Ellen Wilkinson was as far removed from being a bore as it is possible for any human being to be. Whatever she did, wherever she went, she created an atmosphere of excitement and interest&nbsp;... and not just because of her red hair and green dress".<ref>{{cite newspaper|last= Cazalet-Keir|first= Thelma|title= Miss Ellen Wilkinson: The Tributes of Three Women|url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/475064921/AD44E19975D54E3DPQ/1?accountid=17321|newspaper= The Observer|date= 9 February 1947|page = 7}} {{subscription}}</ref>

In the course of her career Wilkinson contributed to reforms in numerous policy areas: women's equal suffrage, women civil servants' equal pay, provision of air raid shelters for city dwellers, and protection of hire purchase borrowers' rights.<ref name= B134>Bartley, pp. 134<U+2013>35</ref> The historian David Kynaston cites  as her greatest practical achievement her success in meeting the timetable for the raising of the school leaving age;<ref>Kynaston, p. 575</ref>   her successor as education minister, [[George Tomlinson]], recorded how hard she had fought to avoid postponement of the reform, and expressed his sorrow that she died before the set date.<ref>George Tomlinson, quoted in {{cite journal|last= Hughes|first= H.D. "Billy"|title= In Defence of Ellen Wilkinson|url= http://www.jstor.org/stable/4288229|journal= History Workshop|volume= |issue= 7|date= Spring 1979|pages= pp. 157<U+2013>60}} {{subscription}}</ref> Wilkinson was sometimes criticised for extending her efforts too widely; a local newspaper, the ''North Mail'', complained in May 1937 that "Miss Wilkinson is working for too many causes to do justice to Jarrow".<ref>''North Mail'', 29 May 1937, quoted in Vernon, p. 148</ref> Nevertheless,   her book ''The Town that was Murdered'' brought to public notice the plight of Jarrow and the broader consequences of unbridled capitalism on working-class communities; the book, Harrison observes,  "educated the nation".<ref name= odnbW/>
{{Quote box|width=350px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align=left|quote=  "Ellen Wilkinson was small in stature, but there were occasions when she dwarfed her colleagues by the tenacity with which she stood up for the principles she held to be right".|salign = left|source= Violet Markham, 9 February 1947<ref>{{cite newspaper|last= Markham|first= Violet|title= Miss Ellen Wilkinson: The Tributes of Three Women|url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/475064921/AD44E19975D54E3DPQ/1?accountid=17321|newspaper= The Observer|date= 9 February 1947|page =  7}} {{subscription}}</ref>  }}
Wilkinson never married, although   she enjoyed numerous close friendships with men. Apart from her early   engagement to Walton Newbold, she was close to John Jagger for many years,<ref>Vernon, pp. 124<U+2013>25</ref> and in the early 1930 enjoyed a brief romantic attachment with Frank Horrabin.<ref name= odnbW/> Her long association with Morrison  began in her early Fabian days; Morrison was very reticent about this friendship, choosing not to mention Wilkinson in his 1960 autobiography despite their close political association. Vernon says that the relationship  almost certainly became "more than platonic", but as  Wilkinson's private papers were destroyed after her death, and Morrison maintained  silence over the matter, the full nature and extent of their friendship remains unknown.<ref  name= B132/><ref>Vernon, pp. 126<U+2013>29</ref>

On 25 January 1941 Wilkinson received the freedom of the town of Jarrow,<ref name= V146/> and in May 1946  was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Manchester.<ref name= V28/> Her name has been commemorated in [[The Ellen Wilkinson School for Girls]] in [[Ealing]], West London,<ref>{{cite web|title= The Ellen Wilkinson School for Girls: A Specialist College for Science and Mathematics|url= http://www.ellenwilkinson.ealing.sch.uk/|publisher= The Ellen Wilkinson School|accessdate= 23 October 2014}}</ref> and in the Ellen Wilkinson Primary School and Children's Centre in [[Newham]], East London.<ref>{{cite web|title= Ellen Wilkinson Primary School and Children's Centre|url= http://www.ellenwilkinson.newham.sch.uk/|publisher= Ellen Wilkinson Primary School and Children's Centre|accessdate= 23 October 2014}}</ref> In addition, the [[Ellen Wilkinson High School]] in Ardwick, which incorporated Wilkinson's old school, bore her name for some years before its closure  in 2000.<ref name= school/><ref>{{cite web|title= Establishment: Ellen Wilkinson High School|url= http://www.education.gov.uk/edubase/establishment/summary.xhtml?urn=105566&printable=1|publisher= Edubase (UK governmeent)|accessdate= 2 November 2014}}</ref>  The Ellen Wilkinson Building in the University of Manchester's campus houses parts of the [[School of Psychological Sciences, University of Manchester|School of Psychological Sciences]] and other departments.<ref>{{cite web|title= Ellen Wilkinson Building|url= http://www.psych-sci.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/maps/ellenwilkinson/|publisher= University of Manchester|accessdate= 23 October 2014}}</ref> A blue plaque  records the site of Wilkinson's birthplace,<ref>{{cite web|title= Ellen Wilkinson (1891<U+2013>1947) Stateswoman and Cabinet Minister, was born at 41 Coral Street on this site|url= http://openplaques.org/plaques/821|publisher= Open Plaques|accessdate= 23 October 2014}}</ref> and another, in the main quadrangle of the old university buildings,  records Wilkinson's attendance there from 1910<U+2013>13.<ref>{{cite web|title= Ellen Wilkinson (1891<U+2013>1947) Labour politician and first female Minister of Education graduate BA History 1913, MA 1914|url= http://openplaques.org/plaques/30174|publisher= Open Plaques|accessdate= 23 October 2014}}</ref>
