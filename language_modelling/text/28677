'''Jos<U+00E9> Ramon Fern<U+00E1>ndez''' "Marqu<U+00E9>s de La Esperanza" (1808<U+2013>1883), was the wealthiest sugar baron in Puerto Rico in the 19th century. He was also one of the most powerful men of the entire Spanish Caribbean.<ref name="HLE">[http://www.manati.info/biografias/marqu/marques_esperanza.htm Jos<U+00E9> R. Fern<U+00E1>ndez y Mart<U+00ED>nez "Marqu<U+00E9>s de La Esperanza"]</ref> His wealth and political connections gave him the power to convince the Spanish Colonial government in the island to split the  municipality of [[Manati, Puerto Rico|Manati]] in two, thus the creation of the municipality of [[Barceloneta, Puerto Rico|Barceloneta]].

==Early years==

Fern<U+00E1>ndez (birth name: Jos<U+00E9> Ramon Fern<U+00E1>ndez y Mart<U+00ED>nez) was one of three siblings born to Fernando Fern<U+00E1>ndez and Francisca Mart<U+00ED>nez in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. Fern<U+00E1>ndez's father was a naval captain who fought against [[pirates]] and  [[England|English]] merchant ships. In 1797, the Spanish Royal Crown granted him land in the towns of [[Bayamon, Puerto Rico|Bayamon]] and Manati in recognition of his service to [[Spain]]. In Bayamon he planted [[sugar cane]]s and raised cattle.<ref>[http://www.literarytraveler.com/literary_articles/rum_diary.aspx Traveler]</ref> His father named the property the "Santa Ana Plantation". In 1804, the elder Fern<U+00E1>ndez used a mixture of sugar and honey to process and distill rum. He aged his product in special barrels which were imported from [[Europe]]. The rum he produced was only for his own personal use and that of his family. In 1827, he ordered his 127 slaves to build an enormous [[windmill]] shaped like a [[tower]]. The windmill helped to extract the juice from the sugar canes. He would still resort to the use of [[Human resources|manpower]], whenever the wind wasn't strong enough for to operate the windmill.<ref name="SJH">[http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2003/vol7n34/RumRise-en.shtml  Puerto Rico Herald]</ref> The Elder Fern<U+00E1>ndez did the same with his other plantation in Manati, which he named "Hacienda La Esperanza".<ref name="HLE"/><ref name="JRF">[http://files.asme.org/asmeorg/communities/history/landmarks/5563.pdf HACIENDA LA ESPERANZA]</ref> 

Fern<U+00E1>ndez received his primary education in Puerto Rico. In 1819, when he was eleven years old his father sent him to [[Spain]] to study business administration. When he was seventeen he continued his education in [[England]] where he became fluent in the [[English language]]. He went to the [[United States]] in his early twenties and continued his education in [[New York City]]. There he befriended various businessmen who in the future will help him in his commercial endeavors.<ref name="HLE"/><ref name="JRF"/>

==Return to Puerto Rico==
Fern<U+00E1>ndez returned to Puerto Rico in 1826 and helped his father in the administration of the La Esperanza sugar plantation. He met and befriended George C. Lattimer, the United States consulate in San Juan. Together with Lattimer who was also a sugar broker, he founded Lattimer & Fern<U+00E1>ndez Co. The company, which was located in San Juan, was a distributor of sugar, molasses and rum and also dealt with other commodities such as food and textiles. Fern<U+00E1>ndez married Clemencia Dorado y Serrano and in 1834, decided to dedicate himself to his commercial interests instead of the agricultural ones. He established a warehouse in the town of [[Mayaguez, Puerto Rico|Mayaguez]] where he moved with his family.<ref name="HLE"/><ref name="JRF"/>

Fern<U+00E1>ndez was the president of the "Partido Incondicional Espa<U+00F1>ol" (Unconditional Spanish Party), a conservative political party in Puerto Rico. He was appointed to several political positions. He was in good political standing with Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] and the Spanish appointed Government of the island because of his political views which favored the monarchy and the Spanish colonization of the island. He became involved in with various businesses and in 1850, used his political influence to lobby for the establishment of a railroad line between San Juan and [[Arecibo]] with the financial backing of Augusto de Cottes and Cornelio Kortwright.<ref name="HLE"/><ref name="JRF"/>

An uprising against the monarchs of Spain forced Queen Isabella II to go into exile on September 1868. This revolt, which deposed Isabella, is known as the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Glorious Revolution]], and ushered the [[First Spanish Republic]] into power. The new government replaced Isabella with [[Amadeo I of Spain|Amadeo I]], son of [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|the Italian king]], after much deliberation.<ref>[http://womenshistory.about.com/library/bio/blbio_isabella_ii.htm Women history]</ref> The new provisional government allowed its colonies to send representatives to the Spanish Courts. Fern<U+00E1>ndez was among those who represented Puerto Rico. On February 5, 1869, the Spanish government bestowed the title of "Marqu<U+00E9>s de La Esperanza" (Marquis of Hope) upon Fern<U+00E1>ndez.<ref name="HLE"/><ref name="JRF"/>

When his father died he inherited "La Esperanza", which at the time was one of the largest and the most technically advanced sugar plantations in Puerto Rico. The 2,265 acres of land, where "La Esperanza" was situated, were rich in alluvial deposits an important element for the cultivation of the sugar cane. Fern<U+00E1>ndez owes his prosperity to the slaves who provided the manpower to run the plantation and to the factory equipment which included a steam engine with its two-flue boiler purchased from the West Point Foundry of New York, elaboration (Jamaican) train, a conveyor belt and four evaporators.<ref name="HLE"/><ref name="JRF"/>

Fern<U+00E1>ndez convinced the government to allow the establishment of the municipality of Barceloneta which required that the municipality of Manati be divided in two. His motives were for his own economic benefit and not for the political benefits of the residents of both municipalities. Fern<U+00E1>ndez was well aware that he would have to pay taxes from the movement of goods and slaves if he used the ports of Manati. The establishment of the mew municipality, allowed Fern<U+00E1>ndez to build his own port, thus obtaining movement for his merchandise free of taxes.<ref name="HLE"/><ref name="JRF"/>

==Legacy==
Fern<U+00E1>ndez incurred in many debts because of the money which he barrowed to mechanize his plantation. He was unable to pay his debts and when he died his family became involved in a family feud as to who was the rightful inheritor of the plantation. However it was the Colonial Company Ltd, who Fernandez owed the most money to, that had the final say in the matter. The Colonial Company Ltd. claimed ownership of the land.<ref name="HLE"/><ref name="JRF"/>

In 1975, the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust acquired the Hacienda La Esperanza. La Esperanza is one of the most valuable assets of the Puerto Rico conservation trust. In 1984 the conservation trust began work on the restoration of the structures of the area.<ref>[http://www.manati.info/images/hacienda_esperanza/esperanza.htm Hacienda La Esperanza]</ref>
