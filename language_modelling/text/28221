'''"Dixie"''', also known as '''"I Wish I Was in Dixie"''', '''"Dixie's Land"''', and by other titles, is a [[American popular music|popular American song]]. It is one of the most distinctively American musical products of the 19th century,<ref>Nathan 248.</ref> and probably the best-known song to have come out of [[blackface]] [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]].<ref>Sacks and Sacks 158.</ref> Although not a [[folk song]] at its creation, "Dixie" has since entered the American folk vernacular. The song likely cemented the word "[[Dixie]]" in the [[American English|American]] vocabulary as a synonym for the [[Southern United States]].

Most sources credit [[Ohio]]-born [[Dan Emmett|Daniel Decatur Emmett]] with the song's composition; however many other people have claimed to have composed "Dixie", even during Emmett's lifetime. Compounding the problem of definitively establishing the song's authorship are Emmett's own confused accounts of its writing, and his tardiness in having "Dixie" [[copyright]]ed. The latest challenge has come on behalf of the [[Snowden Family Band|Snowden Family]] of [[Knox County, Ohio|Knox County]], [[Ohio]], who may have collaborated with Emmett to write "Dixie".

The song originated in the blackface minstrel show of the 1850s and quickly grew famous across the United States. Its lyrics, written in a [[racism|racist]], exaggerated version of [[African American Vernacular English]], tell the story of a freed black [[History of slavery in the United States|slave]] pining for the plantation of his birth. During the [[American Civil War]], "Dixie" was adopted as a de facto [[national anthem|anthem]] of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. New versions appeared at this time that more explicitly tied the song to the events of the Civil War. Since the advent of the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]], many have identified the lyrics of the song with the iconography and ideology of the [[Old South]]. Today, "Dixie" is sometimes considered offensive, and its critics link the act of singing it to sympathy for the concept of slavery in the American South. Its supporters, on the other hand, view it as a legitimate aspect of Southern culture and heritage.

== Structure ==
"Dixie" is structured into 32 [[bar (music)|measure]] groups of alternating [[verse]]s and [[refrain]]s, following an AABC pattern. As originally performed, the verse featured a [[solo (music)|soloist]] alternating with a small group of singers; the refrain was sung in unison by the whole troupe. Traditionally, another eight measures of unaccompanied [[fiddle]] playing followed, coming to a partial close in the middle; since 1936, this part has rarely been printed with the sheet music. 

The song was traditionally played at a slower [[tempo]] than most listeners are familiar with today. Rhythmically, the music is "characterized by a heavy, nonchalant, inelegant strut",<ref>Nathan 247.</ref> and is in [[duple meter]], which makes it suitable for both dancing and marching. "Dixie" employs a single rhythmic [[motif (music)|motive]] (two [[sixteenth note]] [[Anacrusis|pickups]] followed by a longer note), which is integrated into long, melodic phrases. The melodic content consists primarily of [[arpeggio|arpeggiations]] of the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] [[triad (music)|triad]], firmly establishing the [[major (music)|major]] [[tonality]]. The melody of the chorus emulates natural inflections of the voice (particularly on the word "away"), and may account for some of the song's popularity.<ref>Nathan 249<U+2013>50</ref>

[[Image:Bryant's Minstrels walkaround 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Detail from a playbill of the Bryant's Minstrels depicting the first part of a walkaround, dated [[19 December]] [[1859]].]]

According to [[musicology|musicologist]] Hans Nathan, "Dixie" resembles other material that [[Dan Emmett]] wrote for [[Bryant's Minstrels]], and in writing it, the composer drew on a number of earlier works. The first part of the song is anticipated by other Emmett compositions, including "[[De Wild Goose-Nation]]" (1844), itself a derivative of "[[Gumbo Chaff]]" (1830s) and ultimately an 18th-century [[music of England|English]] song called "[[Bow Wow Wow (song)|Bow Wow Wow]]". The second part is probably related to even older material, most likely [[music of Scotland|Scottish]] folk songs.<ref>Nathan 259<U+2013>60.</ref> The chorus follows portions of "[[Johnny Roach]]", an Emmett piece from earlier in 1859.<ref>Nathan 254.</ref>

As with other [[blackface]] material, performances of "Dixie" were accompanied by dancing. The song is a [[walkaround]], which originally began with a few [[minstrel show|minstrels]] acting out the lyrics, only to be joined by the rest of the company (a dozen or so individuals for the Bryants). According to a musician named [[Oscar Coon]], Bryant's Minstrels performed a [[jig]] to "Dixie" called Beans of Albany. This is probably Albany Beef, the [[Scots-Irish]] dance that Emmett refers to in a book on fife instruction.<ref>Nathan 260.</ref> A single dancer used the fiddle solo at the end of the song to "strut, twirl his cane, or mustache, and perhaps slyly wink at a girl on the front row."<ref>Wootton, Ada Bedell (1936). "Something New about Dixie". ''The Etude''. Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 194.</ref>

== Lyrics ==
{{listen|filename=Dixie (1916).ogg|title="Dixie"|description=1916 Dixie rendition|description=1916 rendition of Dixie by the Metropolitan Mixed Chorus, with [[Frank Stanley]], [[Ada Jones]], and [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]]|format=[[Ogg]]}}

The lyrics of "Dixie" reflect the mood of the United States in the late 1850s toward growing [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] sentiment. The song presents the point of view, common to minstrelsy at the time, that [[history of slavery in the United States|slavery]] was overall a positive institution. The pining slave had been used in minstrel tunes since the early 1850s, including Emmett's "[[I Ain't Got Time to Tarry]]" and "Johnny Roach". The fact that "Dixie" and its precursors are [[dance music|dance tunes]] only further makes light of the subject.<ref>Spitzer and Walters 8.</ref> In short, "Dixie" makes the case, more strongly than any previous minstrel tune had, that slaves belong in bondage.<ref>Nathan 245.</ref> This is accomplished through the song's protagonist, who, in pseudo-[[African American Vernacular English|black dialect]], implies that despite his freedom, he is homesick for the [[plantation]] of his birth:

:I wish I was in de land ob cotton,
:Old times dar am not forgotten;
:Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.
:In Dixie Land whar I was born in,
:Early on one frosty mornin,
:Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.

The remaining verses drift into the common minstrel idiom of a comical plantation scenario, "supposedly [depicting] the gayer side of life for slaves on Southern plantations":<ref>Abel 30.</ref>

:Old Missus marry "Will-de-weaber,"
:Willium was a gay deceaber;
:Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.
:But when he put his arm around'er,
:He smilled as fierce as a forty-pound'er,
:Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.

The final verse mixes [[nonsense]] and dance steps with the freed-slave scenario:

:Dar's buck-wheat cakes an 'Ingen' batter,
:Makes you fat or a little fatter;
:Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.
:Den hoe it down an scratch your grabble,
:To Dixie land I'm bound to trabble.
:Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land.<ref>Nathan 362<U+2013>4.</ref>

The lyrics use many common phrases found in minstrel tunes of the day<U+2014>"I wish I was in . . ." dates to at least "[[Clare de Kitchen]]" (early 1830s), and "Away down south in . . ." appears in many more songs, including Emmett's "[[I'm Gwine ober de Mountain]]" (1843). The second [[stanza]] clearly echoes "Gumbo Chaff" from the 1830s: "Den Missus she did marry Big Bill de weaver / Soon she found out he was a gay deceiver."<ref>Nathan 260, 262.</ref> The final stanza rewords portions of Emmett's own "De Wild Goose-Nation": "De tarapin he thot it was time for to trabble / He screw aron his tail and begin to scratch grabble."<ref>Nathan 262.</ref> Even the phrase "Dixie's land" had been used in Emmett's "Johnny Roach" and "I Ain't Got Time to Tarry", both first performed earlier in 1859.

As with other minstrel material, "Dixie" entered common circulation among blackface performers, and many of them added their own verses or altered the song in other ways. Emmett himself adopted the tune for a pseudo-African American [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]] in the 1870s or 1880s. The chorus changed to:

:I wish I was in Canaan
:Oaber dar<U+2014>Oaber dar,
:In Canaan's lann de color'd man
:Can lib an die in cloaber
:Oaber dar<U+2014>Oaber dar,
:Oaber dar in de lann ob Canaan.<ref>Quoted in Nathan 252.</ref>

Both Union and Confederate composers produced war versions of the song during the [[American Civil War]]. These variants standardized the spelling and made the song more militant, injecting into the lyrics specific references to the conflict or to Northern or Southern pride. This [[Confederate States of American|Confederate]] verse by [[Albert Pike]] is representative:

:Southrons! hear your country call you!
:Up! lest worse than death befall you! . . .
:Hear the Northern thunders mutter! . . .
:Northern flags in South wind flutter; . . .
:Send them back your fierce defiance!
:Stamp upon the cursed alliance!<ref name="QuotedInAbel36">Quoted in Abel 36.</ref>

Compare [[Frances J. Crosby|Frances J. Crosby's]] [[Union (ACW)|Union]] lyrics:

:On! ye patriots to the battle,
:Hear Fort Moultrie's cannon rattle!
:Then away, then away, then away to the fight!
:Go meet those Southern traitors,
:With iron will.
:And should your courage falter, boys,
:Remember Bunker Hill.
::Hurrah! Hurrah! The Stars and Stripes forever!
::Hurrah! Hurrah! Our Union shall not sever!<ref>Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 156.</ref>

"The New Dixie!: The True 'Dixie' for Northern Singers" takes a different approach, turning the original song on its head:

:Den I'm glad I'm not in Dixie
::Hooray! Hooray!

:In Yankee land I'll took my stand,
:Nor lib no die in Dixie<ref>Quoted in Abel 42.</ref>

Soldiers on both sides wrote endless [[parody]] versions of the song. Often these discussed the banalities of camp life: "Pork and cabbage in the pot, / It goes in cold and comes out hot," or, "Vinegar put right on red beet, / It makes them always fit to eat". Others were more nonsensical: "Way down South in the fields of cotton, / Vinegar shoes and paper stockings".<ref>Quoted in Silber 51.</ref>

Aside from its being rendered in standard English, the chorus was the only section not regularly altered, even for parodies:

:Den I wish I was in Dixie, Hooray! Hooray!
:In Dixie Land, I'll took my stand,
:To lib an die in Dixie,
:Away, Away, Away down south in Dixie,
:Away, Away, Away down south in Dixie.<ref>Nathan 362<U+2013>3.</ref>

== Composition and copyright ==
[[Image:Dixe's_Land_Sheet_Music.jpg|thumb|500px|"I Wish I Was in Dixie's Land" Sheet music]]
According to tradition, [[Ohio]]-born minstrel show composer Daniel Decatur Emmett wrote "Dixie" around 1859. Over his lifetime, Emmett often recounted the story of its composition, and details vary with each account. For example, in various versions of the story, Emmett claimed to have written "Dixie" in a few minutes, in a single night, and over a few days.<ref>Sacks and Sacks 160.</ref> An 1872 edition of ''[[The New York Clipper]]'' provides one of the earliest accounts, claiming that on a Saturday night shortly after Emmett had been taken on as songwriter for the Bryant's Minstrels, Jerry Bryant told him they would need a new walkaround by the following Monday. By this account, Emmett shut himself inside his [[New York City|New York]] flat and wrote the song that Sunday evening.<ref>Sacks and Sacks 244.</ref>

Other details emerge in later accounts. In one, Emmett claimed that "Suddenly, . . .  I jumped up and sat down at the table to work. In less than an hour I had the first verse and chorus. After that it was easy."<ref>Clipping titled "Author of Dixie". Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 160.</ref> In another version, Emmett stared out at the rainy evening and thought, "I wish I was in Dixie." Then, "Like a flash the thought suggested the first line of the walk-around, and a little later the minstrel, fiddle in hand, was working out the melody"<ref>Clipping from "The War Song of the South". Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 160.</ref> (a different story has it that Emmett's wife uttered the famous line).<ref>Levin.</ref> Yet another variant, dated to 1903, further changes the details: "I was standing by the window, gazing out at the drizzly, raw day, and the old circus feeling came over me. I hummed the old refrain, 'I wish I was in Dixie,' and the inspiration struck me. I took my pen and in ten minutes had written the first verses with music. The remaining verses were easy."<ref>1 July 1904. "The Author of 'Dixie' Passes to Great Beyond". ''Mount Vernon Democratic Banner''. Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 160.</ref> In his final years, Emmett even claimed to have written the song years before he had moved to New York.<ref name="Sacks and Sacks 161">Sacks and Sacks 161.</ref> A ''[[Washington Post]]'' article supports this, giving a composition date of 1843.<ref>Quoted in "The Author of Dixie", ''The New York Clipper''. Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 244 note 19.</ref>

Emmett published "Dixie" (under the title "I Wish I Was in Dixie's Land") on [[21 June]] [[1860]] through [[Firth, Pond & Company|Firth, Pond & Co.]] in New York. The original [[manuscript]] has been lost; extant copies were made during Emmett's retirement, starting in the 1890s.

Emmett's tardiness in [[copyright]]ing the song allowed it to proliferate among other minstrel groups and [[variety show]] performers. Rival editions and variations multiplied in [[songbook]]s, [[newspaper]]s and [[broadside]]s. The earliest of these that is known today is a copyrighted edition for piano from the [[John Church Company]] of [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], published on [[26 June]] [[1860]]. Other publishers attributed completely made-up composers with the song: "Jerry Blossom" and "Dixie, Jr.", among others. The most serious of these challenges during Emmett's lifetime came from Southerner [[William Shakespeare Hays]]; this claimant attempted to prove his allegations through a Southern historical society, but he died before they could produce any conclusive evidence. By 1908, four years after Emmett's death, no fewer than 37 people had claimed the song as theirs.<ref>Abel 46. Sacks and Sacks give the same number of claimants but say "By the time of Emmett's death in 1904 . . . ."</ref>

"Dixie" is the only song Emmett ever claimed to have written in a burst of inspiration, and analysis of Emmett's notes and writings shows "a meticulous copyist, [who] spent countless hours collecting and composing songs and sayings for the minstrel stage . . . ; little evidence was left for the improvisational moment."<ref>Sacks and Sacks 164.</ref> ''The New York Clipper'' wrote in 1872 that "[Emmett's] claim to authorship of 'Dixie' was and is still disputed, both in and out of the minstrel profession."<ref>7 September 1872, "Cat and Dog Fight". ''The New York Clipper''. Quoted in Nathan 256.</ref> Emmett himself said, "Show people generally, if not always, have the chance to hear every local song as they pass through the different sections of [the] country, and particularly so with minstrel companies, who are always on the look out for songs and sayings that will answer their business."<ref>Quoted in Toll 42.</ref> He claimed at one point to have based the first part of "Dixie" on "Come Philander Let's Be Marchin, Every One for His True Love Searchin", which he described as a "song of his childhood days". Musical analysis does show some similarities in the [[melody|melodic]] outline, but the songs are not closely related.<ref>Quoted in Nathan 257.</ref> Emmett also credited "Dixie" to an old circus song.<ref name="Sacks and Sacks 161" /> Despite the disputed authorship, Firth, Pond & Co. paid Emmett $300 for all rights to "Dixie" on [[11 February]] [[1861]], perhaps fearing complications spurred by the impending Civil War.<ref>Sacks and Sacks, p. 212 note 4, call $300 "a sum even then considered small"; Abel, p. 31, says that it was "a sizable amount of money in those days, especially for a song." Nathan, p. 269, does not comment on the fairness of the deal.</ref>

=== African American origin? ===
On at least one occasion, Emmett attributed "Dixie" to an unnamed Southern black man,<ref name="Sacks and Sacks 161" /> and some of his contemporaries said that the song was based on an old [[African American music|African American]] [[folk song|folk tune]]. Taken at face value, these claims are hardly surprising, as minstrels often billed themselves as authentic delineators of slave material. Names of these chance-met black songwriters were rarely given.

[[Image:Ben and Lew Snowden in window.jpg|left|thumb|275px|Lew and Ben Snowden on banjo and fiddle in the second-story gable of their home, [[Clinton, Ohio|Clinton]], Knox County, Ohio, c. 1890s.]]

However, a [[Mount Vernon, Ohio|Mount Vernon]], [[Ohio]], tradition, which dates to the 1910s or 1920s at the latest,<ref>Sacks and Sacks 17.</ref> lends some credence to this notion. Many Mount Vernon residents claim that Emmett collaborated informally with a pair of black musicians named Ben and Lew Snowden. Those who remember the Snowden brothers describe them as "informal", "spontaneous", "creative", and "relatively free of concern over ownership" of their songs.<ref>Sacks and Sacks 162.</ref> The Snowden brothers were part of the [[Snowden Family Band]], which was well known for traveling about the region. That Emmett might have met and played with these local celebrities is hardly surprising. The story is well enough known that the grave marker for Ben and Lew Snowden, set in 1976 by the black [[American Legion]] post, reads, "They taught 'Dixie' to Dan Emmett".<ref>Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 3.</ref>

However, the Snowden theory has one serious hole. While Emmett likely did meet and play with Ben and Lew Snowden when he retired to [[Knox County, Ohio|Knox County]], the Snowden brothers would have been only small children at the time Emmett composed "Dixie". Howard L. Sacks and Judith Sacks suggest that the Ohio legend may in fact be off by a generation, and that Emmett could have collaborated instead with the Snowden parents, Thomas and Ellen. This idea dates to at least 1978, in a genealogical history of the Robert Greer family of Knox County.<ref>McMillan, Jean Irwin (1978). ''The Greer Family Genealogy: Descendants of Robert and Ann Emerson Greer''. Columbus: J. I. McMillan, p. 1. Quoted in Sacks and Sacks.</ref>

[[Circumstantial evidence]] suggests that this is possible. Emmett's grandparents owned the farm adjacent to the Snowden homestead, and Emmett's father was one of a few blacksmiths to whom Thomas Snowden could have brought his horses for shoeing. Furthermore, an unpublished biography of Emmett, written in 1935 by a friend of the Emmett family, Mary McClane, says that Emmett visited Mt. Vernon several times from 1835 until the 1860s and toured the surrounding area giving fiddle performances.<ref>Sacks and Sacks 168.</ref> Emmett certainly refers to Knox County in other songs, including "[[Seely Simpkins Jig]]", which refers to a fiddler there, and "[[Owl Creek Quickstep]]", which is named for an early settlement in the area.<ref>Sacks and Sacks 170.</ref>

Advocates of the Snowden theory believe that the lyrics of "Dixie" are a protest through [[irony]] and parody against the institution of slavery. The references to "Cimmon seed an' sandy bottom" in one version of the song may refer to [[Nanjemoy, Maryland|Nanjemoy]], [[Maryland]], Ellen Snowden's birthplace, and located in an area that was known for its persimmons and sandy, wet lowlands.<ref>This variant of "Dixie" appears in September 1895, ''Confederate Veteran'', 3: 268<U+2013>9; the first verse was also printed in Werlein's "I Wish I Was in Dixies [''sic''] Land", published in New Orleans in 1860. Abel 32 and Silber 51 call it a Northern parody. Nathan 359 and Sacks and Sacks 247 note 54, on the other hand, claim it is the closest representation of the original lyrics.</ref> Slaves rarely knew their exact birth date, instead recalling broad details that someone was born, for example, "Early on one frosty mornin'". A domestic slave, as Ellen Snowden had been, would have been well placed to witness a love affair between "Old Missus" and "Will-de-weaber". Food imagery, such as "buck-wheat cake" and "'Ingen' batter", further points to a writer who had some experience as a cook.<ref>Sacks and Sacks 171<U+2013>9.</ref>

A 1950 article by Ada Bedell Wootton claims that Ben and Lew Snowden sometimes played with Dan Emmett during the minstrel's retirement.<ref>Sacks and Sacks 197.</ref> At his death in 1923, Lew Snowden owned a small box of newspaper clippings asserting Emmett's authorship of "Dixie". He also had a small framed photograph of Emmett, a fixture on the Snowden house's wall for years, with the text "Author of 'Dixie'!" written under the minstrel's name. Nevertheless, many scholars, such as E. Lawrence Abel, dismiss the Snowden claims outright.<ref name="Abel 49">Abel 49.</ref>

== Popularity through the Civil War ==
[[Image:Bryants Minstrels Dixie.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Detail from a playbill for Bryant's Minstrels at the [[4 April]] [[1859]] premiere of "Dixie", [[Mechanics' Hall, New York City]]]]
Bryant's Minstrels premiered "Dixie" in New York City on [[4 April]] [[1859]] as part of their blackface minstrel show. It appeared second to last on the bill, perhaps an indication of the Bryants' lack of faith that the song could carry the minstrel show's entire finale.<ref>Nathan 245 states that the date of first performance is often given incorrectly.</ref> The walkaround was billed as a "plantation song and dance".<ref>Quoted in Abel 30.</ref> It was a runaway success, and the Bryants quickly made it their standard closing number.

"Dixie" quickly gained wide recognition and status as a minstrel standard, and it helped rekindle interest in plantation material from other troupes, particularly in the third act. It became a favorite of [[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln's]] and was played during his campaign in 1860 and at his [[inauguration]] in 1861. The ''New York Clipper'' wrote that it was "one of the most popular compositions ever produced" and that it had "been sung, whistled, and played in every quarter of the globe."<ref>10 August 1861. ''The New York Clipper''. Quoted in Nathan 269.</ref> [[Buckley's Serenaders]] performed the song in [[London]] in late 1860, and by the end of the decade, it had found its way into the repertoire of British sailors. As the American Civil War broke out, one New Yorker wrote, 

<blockquote>"Dixie" has become an institution, an irrepressible institution in this section of the country . . . As a consequence, whenever "Dixie" is produced, the pen drops from the fingers of the plodding clerk, spectacles from the nose and the paper from the hands of the merchant, the needle from the nimble digits of the maid or matron, and all hands go hobbling, bobbling in time with the magical music of "Dixie."<ref>Circa 1861. Clipping from the ''New York Commercial Advertiser''. Quoted in Nathan 271.</ref></blockquote>

The song even added a new term to the American lexicon: "Whistling 'Dixie'" is a [[slang]] expression meaning "[engaging] in unrealistically rosy fantasizing".<ref>2000. ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', 4th ed.</ref> For example, "Don't just sit there whistling 'Dixie'!" is a reprimand against inaction, and "You ain't just whistling 'Dixie'!" indicates that the addressee is serious about the matter at hand.

The [[Rumsey and Newcomb Minstrels]] brought "Dixie" to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] in March 1860; the walkaround became the hit of their show. That April, [[Mrs. John Wood]] sang "Dixie" in a [[John Brougham]] [[burlesque]] called ''[[Po-ca-hon-tas, or The Gentle Savage]]'', increasing the song's popularity in New Orleans. On the surface "Dixie" seems an unlikely candidate for a Southern hit; it has a Northern composer, stars a black protagonist, is intended as a dance song, and lacks any of the patriotic bluster of most national hymns and marches. Had it not been for the atmosphere of [[sectionalism]] in which "Dixie" debuted, it might have faded into obscurity.<ref>Silber 50.</ref> Nevertheless, the refrain "In Dixie Land I'll took my stand / To lib an die in Dixie", coupled with the first verse and its sanguine picture of the South, hit a chord. Woods's New Orleans audience demanded no fewer than seven encores.<ref name="Abel 32">Abel 32.</ref>

[[Image:Werlein's Dixie.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Unauthorized sheet music to "Dixie", published by [[P. P. Werlein]] and Halsey of New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1861.]]

New Orleans publisher [[Philip Werlein|P. P. Werlein]] took advantage and published "Dixie" in New Orleans. He credited music to J. C. Viereck and Newcomb for lyrics. When the minstrel denied authorship, Werlein changed the credit to W. H. Peters. Werlein's version, subtitled "Sung by Mrs. John Wood", was the first "Dixie" to do away with the faux black dialect and misspellings. The publication did not go unnoticed, and Firth Pond & Co. threatened to sue. The date on Werlein's [[sheet music]] precedes that of Firth, Pond & Co.'s version, but Emmett later recalled that Werlein had sent him a letter offering to buy the rights for $5.<ref>Nathan 267 note 42.</ref> In a New York musical publishers' convention, Firth, Pond & Co. succeeded in convincing those present that Emmett was the composer. In future editions of Werlein's arrangement, Viereck is merely credited as "[[arrangement|arranger]]". Whether ironically or sincerely, Emmett dedicated a sequel called "[[I'm Going Home to Dixie]]" to Werlein in 1861.<ref>Quoted in Nathan 269.</ref>

"Dixie" quickly spread to the rest of the South, enjoying vast popularity. By the end of 1860, secessionists had adopted it as theirs; on [[20 December]] the band played "Dixie" after each vote for secession at [[St. Andrew's Hall]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]].<ref name="Abel 32" /> On [[18 February]] [[1861]], the song took on something of the air of [[national anthem]] when it was played at the inauguration of [[Jefferson Davis]], arranged as a [[quickstep]] by [[Hermann Arnold]], and possibly for the first time as a band arrangement.<ref>A monument in Montgomery, Alabama, on the site of the inauguration reads, "Dixie was played as a band arrangement for the first time on this occasion". Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 4.</ref> Emmett himself reportedly told a fellow minstrel that year that "If I had known to what use they were going to put my song, I will be damned if I'd have written it."<ref>Letter from Col. T. Allston Brown to T. C. De Leon. Published in De Leon, ''Belles, Beaux, and Brains'' and quoted in Nathan 275.</ref>

In May 1861 Confederate [[Henry Hotze]] wrote:

<blockquote>It is marvellous with what wild-fire rapidity this tune "Dixie" has spread over the whole South. Considered as an intolerable nuisance when first the streets re-echoed it from the repertoire of wandering minstrels, it now bids fair to become the musical symbol of a new nationality, and we shall be fortunate if it does not impose its very name on our country.<ref>Hotze, Henry (5 May 1861). "Three Months in the Confederate Army: The Tune of Dixie". ''The Index''. Quoted in Harwell, ''Confederate Music'', 43; quoted in turn in Nathan 272.</ref></blockquote>

Southerners who shunned the song's low origins and comedic nature changed the lyrics, usually to focus on Southern pride and the war.<ref>Abel 35.</ref> Albert Pike's enjoyed the most popularity; the ''Natchez (Mississippi) Courier'' published it on [[30 May]] [[1861]] as "The War Song of Dixie", followed by Werlein, who again credited Viereck for composition. [[Henry Throop Stanton]] published another war-themed "Dixie", which he dedicated to "the Boys in Virginia".<ref name="QuotedInAbel36"/> The defiant "In Dixie Land I'll take my stand / To live and die in Dixie" were the only lines used with any consistency. The tempo also quickened, as the song was a useful quickstep tune. Confederate soldiers by and large preferred these war versions to the original minstrel lyrics. 

{{listen|filename=Dixie 2nd South Carolina String Band.ogg|title="Dixie's Land"|description=Civil War soldiers favored both war versions of the song and the original lyrics, as heard here. This performance is by Civil War re-enactors, the [[2nd South Carolina String Band]].|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Southerners who rallied to the song proved reluctant to acknowledge a [[Yankee]] as its composer. Accordingly, some ascribed it a longer tradition as a folk song. Poet [[John Hill Hewitt]] wrote in 1862 that "The homely air of 'Dixie', of extremely doubtful origin . . . [is] generally believed to have sprung from a noble stock of Southern [[stevedore]] melodies."<ref>Postscript to the poem "War". Quoted in Harwell, Richard B. (1950). ''Confederate Music'', p. 50. Quoted in turn in Nathan p. 256.</ref>

Meanwhile, many Northerners took offense to the South's appropriation of "Dixie". Before even the fall of [[Fort Sumter]], Frances J. Crosby published "Dixie for the Union" and "Dixie Unionized". The tune formed part of the repertoire of both Union [[band (music)|band]]s and common troops until 1863. Broadsides circulated with titles like "The Union 'Dixie'" or "The New Dixie, the True 'Dixie' for Northern Singers". Emmett himself arranged "Dixie" for the military in a book of [[Fife (musical instrument)|fife]] instruction in 1862, and a 1904 work by Charles Burleigh Galbreath claims that Emmett gave his official sanction to Crosby's Union lyrics.<ref>Galbreath, Charles Burleigh (October 1904). "Song Writers of Ohio", ''Ohio Archaeological Quarterly'', 13: 533-34. Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 156.</ref>

Northerners, Emmett among them, also declared that the "Dixie Land" of the song was actually in the North. One common story, still cited today, claimed that Dixie was a [[Manhattan]] slave owner who had sent his slaves south just before New York's 1827 banning of slavery. The stories had little effect; for most Americans "Dixie" was synonymous with the South.<ref>Introduction to sheet music for "I'm Going Home to Dixie". Quoted in Abel 39.</ref>

On [[10 April]] [[1865]], one day after the [[Appomattox Courthouse|surrender]] of General [[Robert E. Lee]], Lincoln addressed a White House crowd:

<blockquote>I propose now closing up by requesting you play a certain piece of music or a tune. I thought "Dixie" one of the best tunes I ever heard . . . I had heard that our adversaries over the way had attempted to appropriate it. I insisted yesterday that we had fairly captured it . . . I presented the question to the Attorney-General, and he gave his opinion that it is our lawful prize . . . I ask the Band to give us a good turn upon it.<ref>Sandburg, Carl. (1939) ''Abraham Lincoln, The War Years'', vol. IV, 207-8. Quoted in Nathan 275.</ref></blockquote>

"Dixie" slowly re-entered Northern repertoires, mostly in private performances. New Yorkers resurrected stories about "Dixie" being a part of Manhattan, thus reclaiming the song for themselves. The ''[[New York Weekly]]'' wrote, "... no one ever heard of Dixie's land being other than Manhattan Island until recently, when it has been erroneously supposed to refer to the South, from its connection with pathetic negro allegory."<ref>1871 edition of the ''New York Weekly'', quoted in Abel 43.</ref> In 1888 the publishers of a [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] songbook included "Dixie" as a "patriotic song", and in 1895 the [[Confederate Veterans' Association]] suggested a celebration in honor of "Dixie" and Emmett in Washington as a bipartisan tribute. One of the planners noted that:

<blockquote>In this era of peace between the sections . . . thousands of people from every portion of the United States will be only too glad to unite with the ex-confederates in the proposed demonstration, and already some of the leading men who fought on the Union side are enthusiastically in favor of carrying out the programme. Dixie is as lively and popular an air today as it ever was, and its reputation is not confined to the American continent . . . [W]herever it is played by a big, strong band the auditors cannot help keeping time to the music.<ref>Clipping from "The Author of Dixie", c. 1895. Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 156.</ref></blockquote>

However, "Dixie" was still most strongly associated with the South. Northern singers and writers often used it for parody or as a [[quotation]] in other pieces to establish a person or setting as Southern. For example, [[African American]]s [[Eubie Blake]] and [[Noble Sissle]] quoted "Dixie" in the song "Banana Days" for their 1921 [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Shuffle Along]]''. In 1905 the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] mounted a campaign to acknowledge an official Southern version of the song (one that would purge it forever of its African American associations).<ref name="Abel 49" /> Although they obtained the support of the [[United Confederate Veterans]] and the [[United Sons of Confederate Veterans]], Emmett's death the year before turned sentiments against the project, and the groups were ultimately unsuccessful in having any of the 22 entries universally adopted.

As African Americans entered minstrelsy, they exploited the song's popularity in the South by playing "Dixie" as they first arrived in a Southern town. According to Tom Fletcher, a black minstrel of the time, it tended to please those who might otherwise be antagonistic to the arrival of a group of black men.<ref>Watkins 101.</ref>

Still, "Dixie" was not rejected outright in the North. An article in the ''[[New York Tribune]]'', c. 1908, said that "though 'Dixie' came to be looked upon as characteristically a song of the South, the hearts of the Northern people never grew cold to it. President Lincoln loved it, and to-day it is the most popular song in the country, irrespective of section."<ref>Circa 1908, "How 'Dan' Emmett's Song Became the War Song of the South", New York ''Tribune''. Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 156.</ref> As late as 1934, the music journal ''[[The Etude]]'' asserted that "the sectional sentiment attached to ''Dixie'' has been long forgotten; and today it is heard everywhere<U+2014>North, East, South, West."<ref>Smith, Will (September 1934). "The Story of Dixie and Its Picturesque Composer". ''Etude'' 52: 524. Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 156.</ref>

"Dixie" had become Emmett's most enduring legacy. In the 1900 census of Knox County, Emmett's occupation is given as "author of Dixie".<ref>Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 223 note 3.</ref> The band at Emmett's funeral played "Dixie" as he was lowered into his grave. His grave marker, placed 20 years after his death, reads,

<center>To the Memory of</center>
<center>Daniel Decatur Emmett</center>
<center>1815<U+2014>1904</center>
<center>Whose Song 'Dixie Land' inspired the courage</center>
<center>and Devotion of the Southern People and now</center>
<center>Thrills the Hearts of a Reunited Nation.<ref>Quoted in Abel 46.</ref></center>

== "Dixie" opposed ==
Beginning in the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1950s and 1960s, however, African Americans have frequently challenged "Dixie" as a [[racism|racist]] relic of the Confederacy and a reminder of decades of white domination and [[racial segregation|segregation]]. These feelings were amplified when white opponents to civil rights began answering songs such as "[[We Shall Overcome]]" with the unofficial Confederate anthem.<ref>Neely-Chandler, Thomasina, quoted in Johnston.</ref>

The earliest of these protests came from students of Southern universities, where "Dixie" was a staple of a number of marching bands. In 1966 a student of the [[University of Mississippi]] named Irvin Walker noted, "Can you imagine what it's like to have all these white people stand up around you for the song, and you stay sitting there, a Negro?" His classmate, Earnest Watson, added, "I feel like standing up for the song if I'm a student. But you got to realize what it means to most of them. Sure, I wish they'd have some [[fight song]] I could stand up and cheer for. But not 'Dixie,' man. Not that one. That's the worst thing about going to the games. If they wouldn't play 'Dixie' so much, it'd be O.K."<ref>Frady, Marshall (1966). "If They Wouldn't Play 'Dixie' So Much...." ''Mademoiselle'', 36: 333. Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 155.</ref> In 1967 black cadets at [[The Citadel (Military College)|The Citadel]] refused to stand for "Dixie" or to sing and perform it at football games. Similar protests have since occurred at the [[University of Virginia]], the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], and [[Tulane University]]. In 2002, the University of Mississippi's vice chancellors attempted to compromise by adding more general American pieces to the band's playlist and by restricting the playing of "Dixie" to twice per game.

The debate has since moved beyond student populations. Members of the 75th [[United States Army Band]] protested "Dixie" in 1971. In 1989 three black Georgia senators walked out when the Miss Georgia Sweet Potato Queen sang "Dixie" in the Georgia chamber. Meanwhile, many black musicologists have challenged the song's racist origins. For example, Sam Dennison writes that "Today, the performance of 'Dixie' still conjures visions of an unrepentant, militarily recalcitrant South, ready to reassert its aged theories of white supremacy at any moment . . . This is why the playing of 'Dixie' still causes hostile reactions."<ref>Dennison, Sam (1982). ''Scandalize My Name: Black Imagery in American Popular Music'', p. 188. Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 4.</ref>

On the other hand, for many Southerners, "Dixie", like the [[Confederate flag]], is a symbol of Southern heritage and identity.<ref>Abel 51.</ref> Others consider the song a part of the patriotic American repertoire on a par with "[[America the Beautiful]]" and "[[Yankee Doodle]]". For example, Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] regularly included "Dixie" in his annual [[sing-along]] for the 4th Circuit Judicial Conference in [[Virginia]]. However, its performance prompted some African American lawyers to avoid the event. White lawyer George C. Freeman, Jr., who attended Rehnquist's June 1999 gathering, defended the song: "I think all that stuff about reliving history is overblown . . . I really think that the past is the past."<ref>Quoted in Timberg.</ref>

Performers who choose to sing "Dixie" today usually remove the faux dialect and combine the song with other pieces. For example, [[Rene Marie|Rene Marie's]] jazz version mixes "Dixie" with "[[Strange Fruit]]", a [[Billie Holiday]] song about a [[lynching]]. [[Mickey Newbury|Mickey Newbury's]] "[[An American Trilogy]]" (often performed by [[Elvis Presley]]) combines "Dixie" with the Union's "[[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]" and the African American spiritual "[[All My Trials]]". 

However, in modern times "Dixie" is usually heard as an instrumental piece. Thus, to countless people "Dixie" signifies nothing more than "Southern United States".<ref name="Sacks and Sacks 159">Sacks and Sacks 159.</ref> This interpretation has been reinforced through years of [[American popular culture]]. For example, the soundtracks of cartoons featuring Southern characters like [[Foghorn Leghorn]] often play "Dixie" to quickly set the scene. On the television series ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', which takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], the car horn of the [[General Lee (car)|General Lee]] plays part of the melody from the song. Sacks and Sacks argue that such apparently innocent associations only further serve to tie "Dixie" to its blackface origins, as these comedic programs are, like the minstrel show, "inelegant, parodic [and] dialect-ridden".<ref name="Sacks and Sacks 159" /> However, "Dixie" signals "Southern" in more serious fare, as well. [[Ken Burns]] makes use of instrumental versions in his ''[[The Civil War (documentary)|Civil War]]'' documentary, for example.
