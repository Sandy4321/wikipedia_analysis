{{History of Afghanistan}}
The '''Emirate of [[Afghanistan]]''' began with the reign of [[Habibollah Shah]] in 1823 and ended when Amir [[Amanullah Khan]] became Shah in 1926. This period was characterized by the expansion of European colonial interests in Central Asia. In 1919 Afghanistan gained [[Afghan Independence Day|independence from the United Kingdom]] after the [[Treaty of Rawalpindi]]. The emirate was briefly restored by [[Habibullah Ghazi]] in 1929.<ref name="afghan">{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.afghan-web.com/history/chron/index3.html |title=Chronological History of Afghanistan |publisher=''Afghan-web.com'' | language=| accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>
