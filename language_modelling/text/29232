'''Meggers''' is an [[impact crater]] that lies on the [[Far side (Moon)|far side]] of the [[Moon]]. Nearby craters of note include [[Olcott (crater)|Olcott]] to the southwest, and [[Innes (crater)|Innes]] and [[Seyfert (crater)|Seyfert]] farther away to the northwest. To the east lies [[Vernadskiy (crater)|Vernadskiy]].

The rim of Meggers is roughly circular in form, with slight outward bulges to the southeast and northeast. The crater merges with a comparably sized formation to the northwest, and the intervening rim is somewhat irregular in form. The interior floor of Meggers is slightly irregular.

To the west is the crater Meggers S, a formation almost as large as Meggers itself. It has a rough interior and a tiny crater lies across the southern rim.

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater mid-point that is closest to Meggers.
