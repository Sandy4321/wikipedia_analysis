<!-- His name is Jimmy and not James; Donal and not Donald -->'''Jimmy Donal''' "'''Jimbo'''" '''Wales''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>do<U+028A>n<U+0259>l <U+02C8>we<U+026A>lz}}; born August 7 or August 8, 1966{{Ref_label|A|note|none}}) is an American [[Internet entrepreneur]] and a co-founder and promoter of [[Wikipedia]].<ref name='WMF PR 2004-04-25'/><ref name="Economist2008"/>

Wales was born in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. He attended [[Randolph School|The Randolph School]] and a [[university-preparatory school]], and then earned bachelor's and master's degrees in finance. While in graduate school, he taught at two universities. Wales later took a job in finance, and worked as the research director of a Chicago futures and options firm for several years. In 1996, he and two partners founded [[Bomis]], a web portal that targeted males, and which hosted, and provided the initial funding for, the peer-reviewed encyclopedia [[Nupedia]] (2000<U+2013>2003) and its successor, Wikipedia.

In 2001, together with [[Larry Sanger]] and others, Wales helped launch Wikipedia, a free, [[open content]] encyclopedia which enjoyed rapid growth and popularity. As Wikipedia's public profile grew, Wales became the project's promoter and [[spokesman]]. Wales is historically cited as a [[Wikipedia:Founder|co-founder of Wikipedia]], though he has disputed the "co-" designation in declaring himself the sole founder.<ref name="Larry_Sanger_Springs_Citizendium"/><ref name="Parmy Olson"/> Wales serves on the [[Trustee|Board of Trustees]] of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], the non-profit charitable organization which operates Wikipedia. He holds its board-appointed "community founder" seat. In 2004, he co-founded [[Wikia]], a privately-owned, free Web-hosting service, with fellow Wikimedia trustee [[Angela Beesley]].

Wales has been married twice and has a daughter with Christine, his second wife, from whom he is separated. He describes himself as an [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] and, with reservations, a [[libertarian]]. His role in creating Wikipedia, which has become the world's largest encyclopedia, prompted ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine to name him in its 2006 list of the world's most influential people. Wales is the ''de facto'' leader of Wikipedia.<ref name="Economist2008"/><ref name="Holden Frith"/>

==Early life and education==
Wales was born in [[Huntsville, Alabama]] in the United States on August 7, 1966.<ref name=reasonmag/>{{Ref_label|A|note|none}} His father, Jimmy,<ref name=kazek/> worked as a grocery store manager while his mother, Doris, and his grandmother, Erma, ran the House of Learning,<ref name=bookstopshere/> a small private school in the tradition of the [[one-room school]]house, where Wales and his three siblings received their early education.<ref name=reasonmag/><ref name=bookstopshere/> As a child, Wales was a keen reader with an acute intellectual curiosity,<ref name="Economist2008"/> and, in what he credits to the influence of the [[Montessori method]] on the school's philosophy of education, "spent lots of hours pouring{{sic}} over the ''Britannicas'' and ''World Book Encyclopedias''".<ref name="qanda"/> There were only four other children in Wales' [[Educational stages#United States and Canada|grade]], so the school grouped together the first through fourth grade students and the fifth through eighth grade students.<ref name="qanda"/> Wales is sharply critical of the government's treatment of the school, citing the "constant interference and bureaucracy and very sort of snobby inspectors from the state" as a formative influence on his political philosophy.<ref name="qanda"/>

After eighth grade, Wales attended [[Randolph School]],<ref name = "Randolph"/> a university-preparatory school in Huntsville, graduating at sixteen.<ref name=trend/> Wales has said that the school was expensive for his family, but that "education was always a passion in my household ... you know, the very traditional approach to knowledge and learning and establishing that as a base for a good life."<ref name="qanda"/> He received his bachelor's degree in finance from [[Auburn University]] (notable for its free market economists-see [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]) and entered the [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] finance program at the [[University of Alabama]] before leaving with a master's degree to enter the Ph.D. finance program at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]].<ref name="qanda"/><ref name=reasonmag/><ref name=trend/> He taught at both universities during his postgraduate studies, but did not write the doctoral dissertation required for a Ph.D., something which he has ascribed to boredom.<ref name="qanda"/><ref name=reasonmag/>

==Career==
===Chicago Options Associates and Bomis===
In 1994, Wales took a job with Chicago Options Associates, a [[futures contract|futures]] and [[option (finance)|options]] trading firm in [[Chicago]], Illinois.<ref name="qanda"/><ref name="2.0"/><ref name="knowitall"/> By "speculating on interest rate and foreign-currency fluctuations," he had soon earned enough to "support himself and his wife for the rest of their lives," according to Daniel Pink of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine.<ref name=bookstopshere/> Wales has described himself as having been [[internet addiction|addicted to the Internet]] from an early stage and used to write computer code as a pastime.<ref name="karasz"/> During his studies in Alabama, he became an obsessive player of [[Multi-User Dungeons]] (MUDs)<U+2014>a type of virtual [[role-playing game]]<U+2014>and thereby experienced the potential of computer networks to foster large-scale collaborative projects.<ref name=trend/><ref name="am 2006 p93"/>

Inspired by the remarkable [[initial public offering]] of [[Netscape]] in 1995, he decided to become an internet entrepreneur,<ref name=trend/> and, in 1996, founded the web portal [[Bomis]] with two partners.<ref name=bookstopshere/><ref name="am 2006 p88"/> The website featured [[user-generated content|user-generated]] [[webring]]s and for a time sold erotic photographs.<ref name=accessforall/> Wales described it as a "guy-oriented search engine" with a market similar to that of ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' magazine;<ref name="qanda"/><ref name="reasonmag"/><ref name="wirednews">{{cite news

[[File:L Sanger.jpg|thumb|upright|Philosopher [[Larry Sanger]], whom Wales hired as editor-in-chief of [[Nupedia]]]]

===Nupedia and the origins of Wikipedia===
{{Main|Nupedia}}
Though Bomis had struggled to make money, it provided Wales with the funding to pursue his greater passion, an online [[encyclopedia]].<ref name=reasonmag/> While moderating an online discussion group devoted to the philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] in the early 1990s, Wales had encountered [[Larry Sanger]], a sceptic of the philosophy.<ref name="Economist2008"/> The two had engaged in detailed debate on the subject on Wales' list and then on Sanger's, eventually meeting offline to continue the debate and becoming friends.<ref name="Economist2008"/> Deciding to pursue his encyclopedia project years later, Wales invited Sanger<U+2014>who at that time was a doctoral student in philosophy at [[Ohio State University]]<U+2014>to be its [[Editor in chief|editor-in-chief]], and in March 2000, Nupedia ("the free encyclopedia"), a [[peer-review]]ed, [[Open content|open-content]] encyclopedia, was launched.<ref name="qanda"/><ref name="reasonmag"/> The intent behind Nupedia was to have expert-written entries on a variety of topics, and to sell advertising alongside the entries in order to make profit.<ref name="Economist2008"/> The project was characterized by an extensive peer-review process designed to make its articles of a quality comparable to that of professional encyclopedias.<ref name="Liane Gouthro"/>
{{bquote|The idea was to have thousands of volunteers writing articles for an online encyclopedia in all languages. Initially we found ourselves organising the work in a very top-down, structured, academic, old-fashioned way. It was no fun for the volunteer writers because we had a lot of academic peer review committees who would criticise articles and give feedback. It was like handing in an essay at grad school, and basically intimidating to participate in.|||Jimmy Wales on the Nupedia project|''[[New Scientist]]'', January 31, 2007<ref name=NEWSCMARKS/>}}

In January 2001, Sanger was introduced to the concept of a [[wiki]] by [[extreme programming]] enthusiast [[Ben Kovitz]] after explaining to Kovitz the slow pace of growth Nupedia endured as a result of its onerous submission process.<ref name="am 2006 p91"/> Kovitz suggested that adopting the wiki model would allow editors to contribute simultaneously and incrementally throughout the project, thus breaking Nupedia's bottleneck.<ref name="am 2006 p91"/> Sanger was excited about the idea, and after he proposed it to Wales, they created the first Nupedia wiki on January 10, 2001.<ref name="am 2006 p91"/> The wiki was initially intended as a collaborative project for the public to write articles that would then be reviewed for publication by Nupedia's expert volunteers. The majority of Nupedia's experts, however, wanted nothing to do with this project, fearing that mixing amateur content with professionally researched and edited material would compromise the integrity of Nupedia's information and damage the credibility of the encyclopedia.<ref name=signon/> Thus the wiki project, dubbed "Wikipedia" by Sanger,<ref name="Larry_Sanger_Springs_Citizendium"/> went live at a separate [[domain name|domain]] five days after its creation.<ref name="knowitall"/><ref name=roy/>

===Wikipedia===
{{Main|History of Wikipedia}}
Neither Sanger nor Wales expected very much from the Wikipedia initiative.<ref name="knowitall"/><ref name="am 2006 p93"/> Wales, anticipating "complete rubbish", hoped that if they were lucky, Wikipedia might yield a couple of rough draft entries for Nupedia.<ref name="knowitall"/> To the surprise of Sanger and Wales, within a few days of launching the number of articles on Wikipedia had outgrown that of Nupedia, and a small collective of editors had formed.<ref name="2.0"/><ref name="am 2006 p93"/> Many of the early contributors to the site were familiar with the model of the [[free culture movement]], and, like Wales, many of them sympathized with the [[open-source movement]].<ref name=signon/> Wales has said that he was initially so worried with the concept of open editing, anyone can edit the encyclopedia, that he would awake during the night and monitor what was being added.<ref name="utopia"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Tapscott |first1=Don |last2=Anthony D. |title=Wikinomics |page=71 |year=2008 |publisher=Penguin Group |isbn=1591841937}}</ref> Nonetheless, the cadre of early editors helped create a robust, self-regulating community that has proven conducive to the growth of the project.<ref name=reasonmag/>

Sanger developed Wikipedia in its early phase and guided the project.<ref name="Larry_Sanger_Springs_Citizendium"/><ref name="Michael Singer"/> The broader idea he ascribes to Wales, remarking in a 2005 memoir for [[Slashdot]] that "the idea of an open source, collaborative encyclopedia, open to contribution by ordinary people, was entirely Jimmy's, not mine, and the funding was entirely by Bomis", adding, "the actual development of this encyclopedia was the task he gave me to work on."<ref name=slashdot/> Sanger worked on and promoted both the Nupedia and Wikipedia projects until Bomis discontinued funding for his position in February 2002;<ref name=whyitmatters/> Sanger resigned as editor-in-chief of Nupedia and as "chief organizer" of Wikipedia on March 1 of that year.<ref name=resignation/><ref name=digitaluniverse/> In the early years, Wales had supplied the financial backing for the project,<ref name="Michael Singer"/><ref name=seattle/> and entertained the notion of placing advertisements on Wikipedia before costs were reduced with Sanger's departure and plans for a nonprofit foundation were advanced instead.<ref name="Seth Finkelstein"/>

====Controversy====
Wales has asserted that he is the sole founder of Wikipedia,<ref name="Parmy Olson"/> and has publicly disputed Sanger's designation as a co-founder. Sanger and Wales were identified as co-founders at least as early as September 2001 by ''[[The New York Times]]'' and as founders in Wikipedia's first press release in January 2002.<ref name="sanger-NYTimes"/><ref name="Wikipedia Press Release of 2002"/> In August of that year, Wales identified himself as "co-founder" of Wikipedia.<ref name="Yahoo!"/> Sanger assembled on his personal webpage an assortment of links that appear to confirm the status of Sanger and Wales as co-founders.<ref name="Larry_Sanger_Springs_Citizendium"/><ref name="SangerLinks"/> For example, Sanger and Wales are historically cited or described in early news citations and press releases as co-founders.<ref name="Larry_Sanger_Springs_Citizendium"/> Wales was quoted by ''[[The Boston Globe]]''  as calling Sanger's claim as "preposterous" in February 2006,<ref name="David Mehegan"/> and called "the whole debate silly" in an April 2009 interview.<ref name="William Paoletto"/>

In late 2005, Wales edited his own [[biography|biographical]] entry on the [[English Wikipedia]]. Writer [[Rogers Cadenhead]] drew attention to [[Data logging|logs]] showing that in his edits to the page, Wales had removed references to Sanger as the co-founder of Wikipedia.<ref name="cadenhead"/><ref name="Dan Mitchell"/> Sanger commented that "having seen edits like this, it does seem that Jimmy is attempting to rewrite history. But this is a futile process because in our brave new world of transparent activity and maximum communication, the truth will out."<ref name="wirednews"/><ref name="Rhys Blakely"/> Wales was also observed to have modified references to [[Bomis]] in a way that was characterized as downplaying the sexual nature of some of his former company's products.<ref name="knowitall"/><ref name="wirednews"/> Though Wales argued that his modifications were solely intended to improve the accuracy of the content,<ref name="wirednews"/> he apologized for editing his own biography, a practice generally frowned upon on Wikipedia.<ref name="wirednews"/><ref name="Rhys Blakely"/>

====Role====
[[File:Keynote from Jimmy Wales The State of the Wiki.jpg|thumb|Wales delivering the [[keynote]] speech ("The State of the Wiki") at [[Wikimania]], the conference for Wikimedia projects, in [[Buenos Aires]] in 2009]]
In a 2004 interview with [[Slashdot]], Wales outlined his vision for Wikipedia: "Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing."<ref name=roblimo/> The growth and prominence of Wikipedia made Wales an [[Internet celebrity]].<ref name=arendse/> Though he had never traveled farther than Canada and Mexico prior to founding the site, his participation in the Wikipedia project saw him flying internationally on a near-constant basis as its public face.<ref name="Economist2008"/><ref name=karasz/> Due to his internet celebrity status Jimmy Wales has recently participated in a brand endorsement campaign by the Swiss watch maker [[Maurice Lacroix]].

Although his formal designation is that of mere board member and chairman emeritus of the Wikimedia Foundation, Wales' [[social capital]] within the Wikipedia community has accorded him a status that has been characterized as [[benevolent dictator]], [[constitutional monarch]] and [[spiritual leader]].<ref name=wikipedia@nyt/><ref name=wikiworld/><ref name=egypt/> He is also the closest the project has to a spokesperson.<ref name="Economist2008"/> Despite involvement in other projects, Wales has denied intending to reduce his role within Wikipedia, telling ''The New York Times'' in 2008 that "Dialing down is not an option for me ... Not to be too dramatic about it, but, 'to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language,' that's who I am. That's what I am doing. That's my life goal."<ref name=wikiworld/>
[[File:Wm2007 press 002.jpg|thumb|left|Wales appearing as a member of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] Board of Trustees on a panel at Wikimania 2007.]]

===Wikimedia Foundation===
{{Main|Wikimedia Foundation}}
In mid-2003, Wales set up the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), a [[non-profit organization]] founded in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], and based in [[San Francisco, California]].<ref name=BBCTech/><ref name=cadelago/> All intellectual property rights and domain names pertaining to Wikipedia were moved to the new foundation,<ref name=telegraph/> whose purpose is to establish general policy for the encyclopedia and its sister projects.<ref name="am 2006 p93"/> Originally its [[Chairman (official)|chairman]], and an initial member of the [[Board of Trustees]],<ref name=WMFD/> Wales has held the honorary title of Chairman [[Emeritus]] of the foundation since 2006. He serves on the [[Trustee|Board of Trustees]], holding its board-appointed "community founder" seat.<ref name=terdiman/> His work for the foundation, including his appearances to promote it at computer and educational conferences, has always been unpaid.<ref name=accessforall/> Wales has often joked that donating Wikipedia to the foundation was both the "dumbest and the smartest" thing he had done. On the one hand, he estimated that Wikipedia was worth US$3 billion; on the other, he weighed his belief that the donation made possible its success.<ref name=NEWSCMARKS/><ref name=telegraph/><ref name=dw-world/><ref name=ioltechnology/>

Wales' association with the foundation has led to controversy. In March 2008, Wales was accused by former Wikimedia Foundation employee Danny Wool of misusing the foundation's funds for recreational purposes. Wool also stated that Wales had his Wikimedia credit card taken away in part because of his spending habits, a claim Wales denied.<ref name=moses/> Then-chairperson of the foundation [[Florence Devouard]] and former foundation interim Executive Director Brad Patrick denied any wrongdoing by Wales or the foundation, saying that Wales accounted for every expense and that, for items for which he lacked receipts, he paid out of his own pocket.<ref name=ryan/> Later in March 2008, it was claimed by Jeffrey Vernon Merkey that Wales had edited Merkey's Wikipedia entry to make it more favorable in return for donations to the Wikimedia Foundation, an allegation Wales dismissed as "nonsense".<ref name="Moses2"/><ref name="bbcpaidediting"/>

===Wikia and later pursuits===
In 2004, Wales and then-fellow member of the WMF Board of Trustees [[Angela Beesley]] founded the for-profit company [[Wikia]].<ref name="2.0"/> Wikia is a [[wiki farm]]<U+2014>a collection of individual wikis on different subjects, all hosted on the same website. It hosts some of the largest wikis outside Wikipedia, including [[Memory Alpha]] (devoted to ''Star Trek'') and [[Wookieepedia]] (''Star Wars'').<ref name=bjortomt/> Another service offered by Wikia was [[Wikia Search]], an open source [[web search engine]] intended to challenge [[Google]] and introduce transparency and public dialogue about how it is created into the search engine's operations,<ref name="fastcompany"/> but the project was abandoned in March 2009.<ref name=updateonwikia/> Wales stepped down as Wikia CEO to be replaced by angel investor [[Gil Penchina]], a former vice president and general manager at [[eBay]], on June 5, 2006.<ref name="CEO"/> Penchina declared Wikia to have reached profitability in September 2009.<ref name=lavallee/>

In addition to his role at Wikia, Wales is a public speaker represented by the Harry Walker Agency,<ref name=harrywalker/> which characterizes him as "the founder" of Wikipedia.<ref name=harrywalkerbio/>

He has also participated in a [[celebrity endorsement]] campaign for the Swiss watch maker [[Maurice Lacroix]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schmoozyfox.com/2010/03/a-new-kind-of-brand-ambassadors/ |title=A new kind of brand ambassadors |publisher=Schmoozy Fox |date= |accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref>

==Personal life==
[[File:Christine and Jimmy Wales.jpg||thumb|right|Jimmy Wales with his second wife Christine]]
Wales has been married twice, and has one child.<ref name="qanda"/><ref name="karasz"/> At the age of 20, Wales married Pam, a co-worker at a grocery-store in Alabama.<ref name="karasz"/> He met his second wife, Christine Rohan, through a friend in Chicago while she was working as a steel trader for [[Mitsubishi]].<ref name="qanda"/><ref name=trend/> The couple were married in [[Monroe County, Florida]] in March 1997,<ref name="FMC"/> and had a daughter before separating.<ref name=ryan/> Wales moved to [[San Diego]] in 1998, and after being dissuaded by the housing market there, relocated in 2002  to [[St. Petersburg, Florida]],<ref name=seattle/> where he has remained {{As of|2007|lc=yes}}.<ref name=trend/><ref name="Lewine"/>

Wales had a brief relationship with Canadian conservative columnist [[Rachel Marsden]] in 2008 that began after Marsden contacted Wales about her Wikipedia biography.<ref name=canadian/> After accusations that Wales' relationship constituted a [[conflict of interest]], Wales announced in March 2008 on his Wikipedia user page (and later on his personal blog) that there had been a relationship but that it was over and claimed that it had not influenced any matters on Wikipedia.<ref name="Sydney Morning Herald"/><ref name=USATODAY/> Marsden claimed that Wales had made statements to the contrary via instant messenger, and further claimed that Wales ended the relationship "via an announcement on Wikipedia".<ref name=agrell/>

[[File:JimmyWalesJI5.jpg|thumb|left|Wales in June 2008]]
==Thought and influences==
<!-- First paragraph: personal philosophy -->
Wales is a self-avowed "Objectivist to the core";<ref name="fastcompany"/> [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] being an individualist philosophy developed by writer [[Ayn Rand]] in the 20th century. Wales first encountered the philosophy through reading Rand's novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' while an undergraduate,<ref name="qanda"/> and in 1992 founded an electronic mailing list devoted to "Moderated Discussion of Objectivist Philosophy".<ref name="Economist2008"/><ref name=lrb/> Though he has stated that the philosophy "colours everything I do and think",<ref name="Economist2008"/> he has said "I think I do a better job<U+2014>than a lot of people who self-identify as Objectivists<U+2014>of not pushing my point of view on other people."<ref name=zenmonkeys/> When asked about Rand's influence by [[Brian Lamb]] in his appearance on [[C-SPAN]]'s ''[[Q&A (talk show)|Q&A]]'' in September 2005, Wales cited [[integrity]] and "the virtue of independence" as important to him personally. When asked if he could trace "the Ayn Rand connection" to having a political philosophy at the time of the interview, Wales reluctantly labeled himself a [[libertarianism|libertarian]], qualifying his remark by referring to the United States [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] as "lunatics" and citing "freedom, liberty, basically individual rights, that idea of dealing with other people in a matter that is not initiating force against them" as his guiding principles.<ref name="qanda"/> An interview with Wales served as the cover feature of the June 2007 issue of the libertarian magazine ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]''.<ref name=reasonmag/>

<!-- Second paragraph: Thought/interests that influenced Wikipedia involvement -->
Wales cites [[Austrian School]] economist [[Friedrich von Hayek]]'s essay "[[The Use of Knowledge in Society]]", which he read as an undergraduate,<ref name=knowitall/> as "central" to his thinking about "how to manage the Wikipedia project".<ref name=reasonmag/> Hayek argued that information is decentralised&nbsp;<U+2013> that each individual only knows a small fraction of what is known collectively&nbsp;<U+2013> and that as a result, decisions are best made by those with local knowledge rather than by a central authority.<ref name=reasonmag/> Wales reconsidered Hayek's essay in the 1990s, while reading about the [[open source movement]] (which advocated that software be [[free software|free]] and distributed). He was moved in particular by "[[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]", an essay and later book by one of the founders of the movement, [[Eric S. Raymond]], which "opened [his] eyes to the possibilities of mass collaboration".<ref name="knowitall"/> From his background in finance and working as a futures and options trader, Wales developed an interest in [[game theory]] and the effect of incentives on human collaborative activity, a fascination to which he credits enabling much of his effort with Wikipedia.<ref name=humanities/> He has rejected the notion that his role in promoting Wikipedia is [[altruistic]], which he defines as "sacrificing your own values for others", stating "[t]hat participating in a benevolent effort to share information is somehow destroying your own values makes no sense to me".<ref name="karasz"/>

<ref name="am 2006 p88">[[#CITEREFPoe2006|''The Atlantic Monthly'', September 2006]], p. 88. <small>"In 1996, Wales and two partners founded a Web directory called Bomis. [...] Wales focused on the bottom-up strategy using Web rings, and it worked. Bomis users built hundreds of rings<U+2014>on cars, computers, sports, and especially 'babes' (e.g., the Anna Kournikova Web ring), effectively creating an index of the 'laddie' Web. Instead of helping all users find all content, Bomis found itself positioned as the Playboy of the Internet, helping guys find guy stuff."</small></ref>
<ref name="am 2006 p91">[[#CITEREFPoe2006|''The Atlantic Monthly'', September 2006]], p. 91. <small>"The wiki [technology] quickly gained a devoted following within the software community. And there it remained until January 2001, when Sanger had dinner with an old friend named Ben Kovitz. [...] Over tacos that night, Sanger explained his concerns about Nupedia<U+2019>s lack of progress, the root cause of which was its serial editorial system. [...] Kovitz brought up the wiki and sketched out 'wiki magic,' the mysterious process by which communities with common interests work to improve wiki pages by incremental contributions. If it worked for the rambunctious hacker culture of programming, Kovitz said, it could work for any online collaborative project. The wiki could break the Nupedia bottleneck by permitting volunteers to work simultaneously all over the project. [...] Wales and Sanger created the first Nupedia wiki on January 10, 2001. The initial purpose was to get the public to add entries that would then be <U+201C>fed into the Nupedia process<U+201D> of authorization."</small></ref>
<ref name="am 2006 p93">[[#CITEREFPoe2006|''The Atlantic Monthly'', September 2006]], p. 93. <small>"Wales, though, was a businessman. He wanted to build a free encyclopedia, and Wikipedia offered a very rapid and economically efficient means to that end. The articles flooded in, many were good, and they cost him almost nothing. [...] In 2003, Wales [decided to] diminish his own authority by transferring Wikipedia and all of its assets to the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation, whose sole purpose is to set general policy for Wikipedia and its allied projects. [...] Wales<U+2019>s benign rule has allowed Wikipedia to do what it does best: grow. The numbers are staggering."</small></ref>
