'''New York State Route&nbsp;370''' ('''NY&nbsp;370''') is an east<U+2013>west [[state highway]] in [[Central New York]] in the United States. It extends for {{convert|35.23|mi|2}} from an intersection with [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] and [[New York State Route 104A|NY&nbsp;104A]] south of the [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne County]] village of [[Red Creek, New York|Red Creek]] to a junction with [[U.S. Route 11 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;11]] (US&nbsp;11) in the [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]] city of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. The western and central portions of the route pass through mostly rural areas; however, the eastern section serves densely populated areas of Onondaga County, including the villages of [[Baldwinsville, New York|Baldwinsville]] and [[Liverpool, New York|Liverpool]]. NY&nbsp;370 also passes through [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga County]], where it connects to [[New York State Route 34|NY&nbsp;34]], a major north<U+2013>south highway in Central New York.

NY&nbsp;370 was assigned as part of the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]] as a Red Creek<U+2013>Liverpool highway, replacing [[New York State Route 40 (1920s<U+2013>1930)|NY&nbsp;40]] west of [[Cato (village), New York|Cato]] and New York State Route&nbsp;37 from Cato to Baldwinsville. From Liverpool to Syracuse, modern NY&nbsp;370 was initially part of [[New York State Route 57|NY&nbsp;57]], a route that continued north from Liverpool to [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]]. That route was eliminated in 1982, at which time NY&nbsp;370 was extended eastward to Syracuse over NY&nbsp;57's former routing. Other minor changes, namely a series of realignments west of [[Victory, Cayuga County, New York|Victory]], have also occurred in the years since NY&nbsp;370 was assigned.

==Route description==
[[File:NY 370 west approaching Ridge Rd.jpg|thumb|left|Approaching Ridge Road on NY&nbsp;370 westbound in Wolcott]]
Maintenance of the route is also split in a similar fashion. West of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], the route is maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT). Within Syracuse, the highway is city-maintained.<ref name="inv-cayuga">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-repository2/INV_2010-03-02_cayuga.csv |title=Cayuga County Inventory Listing |date=March 2, 2010 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=December 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name="inv-onondaga">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-repository2/INV_2010-03-02_onondaga.csv |title=Onondaga County Inventory Listing |date=March 2, 2010 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=December 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name="inv-wayne">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-repository2/INV_2010-03-02_wayne.csv |title=Wayne County Inventory Listing |date=March 2, 2010 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=December 24, 2010}}</ref>

===Red Creek to Baldwinsville===
NY&nbsp;370 begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] and [[New York State Route 104A|NY&nbsp;104A]] south of the village of [[Red Creek, New York|Red Creek]] in the northeastern [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne County]] town of [[Wolcott (town), New York|Wolcott]]. The route heads southwest from this spot, utilizing a northeastward extension of [[Ridge Road (Western New York)|Ridge Road]]<ref name="yahoo">{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=43.154656&lon=-76.452135&zoom=12&q1=43.231669%2C-76.730855&q2=43.222882%2C-76.737679&q3=43.163232%2C-76.377361&q4=43.151133%2C-76.299298&q5=43.071086%2C-76.164587 |title=overview map of NY 370 |accessdate=December 24, 2010}}</ref> that was part of [[U.S. Route 104|US&nbsp;104]] prior to the construction of the [[super two]] highway now used by NY&nbsp;104.<ref name="1971map" /> After passing {{convert|0.7|mi|1}} of open farmland, the route breaks from Ridge Road and travels southeast toward the [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga County]] line. The rural surroundings follow NY&nbsp;370 across the county line and into the town of [[Victory, Cayuga County, New York|Victory]], where the highway briefly takes on a more easterly alignment as it intersects [[New York State Route 38|NY&nbsp;38]] in the town center. Past NY&nbsp;38, NY&nbsp;370 gradually curves southward for roughly {{convert|2.5|mi|1}} to reach the Victory<U+2013>[[Conquest, New York|Conquest]] town line. Here, it overtakes the east<U+2013>west Conquest<U+2013>Victory Town Line Road and heads eastward along the town line toward the [[Cato (village), New York|village of Cato]].<ref name="yahoo" />

Just west of Cato village, NY&nbsp;370 enters nearby [[Ira, New York|Ira]] and the town of [[Cato (town), New York|Cato]]. The route continues along the town line into the small village of Cato, where it becomes Main Street and meets [[New York State Route 34|NY&nbsp;34]] in the village center. At this point, NY&nbsp;370 leaves the town line and heads northeast into Ira at the eastern village line. While in Ira, the highway leaves the village of Cato and passes by Cato<U+2013>Meridian Central School, located in an otherwise nondescript area of the town dominated by farmland. At the school, the road curves back to the southeast to serve the village of [[Meridian, New York|Meridian]] and reenter the town of Cato. Here, the route reverts to a generally easterly alignment, one that it retains for the next {{convert|10|mi|0}} to [[Baldwinsville, New York|Baldwinsville]]. East of Meridian, NY&nbsp;370 crosses more cultivated fields as it intersects the south end of [[New York State Route 176|NY&nbsp;176]] and crosses into [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]].<ref name="yahoo" />

Across the county line, NY&nbsp;370 enters the town of [[Lysander, New York|Lysander]] and becomes known as West Genesee Road. It runs across another {{convert|2|mi|1}} of rolling farmland before it begins to parallel the [[Erie Canal]], here part of the [[Seneca River (New York)|Seneca River]]. At this point, the open fields gradually give way to pockets of residential development as the route approaches the village of Baldwinsville. West of the village limits, NY&nbsp;370 connects to [[New York State Route 690|NY&nbsp;690]] and [[New York State Route 31|NY&nbsp;31]] at NY&nbsp;690's northernmost grade-separated interchange. NY&nbsp;31<U+2014>which [[overlap (road)|overlap]]s with NY&nbsp;690 south of the junction<U+2014>leaves the freeway and joins NY&nbsp;370 for a {{convert|2|mi|1|sing=on}} overlap that takes both routes along the north bank of the canal and into the densely populated village. They remain overlapped through Baldwinsville's central business district, where they meet [[New York State Route 48|NY&nbsp;48]] at Oswego Street.<ref name="yahoo" />

===Syracuse area===
[[File:New York State Route 370 Onondaga Lake.jpg|thumb|Running alongside Onondaga Lake on NY&nbsp;370 westbound near Liverpool]]
At the eastern edge of the village center, NY&nbsp;31 and NY&nbsp;370 split, with NY&nbsp;31 retaining the Genesee Street name and heading northeast towards [[Oneida Lake]]. NY&nbsp;370, meanwhile, travels southeast on Salina Street, loosely paralleling the Erie Canal as it heads toward [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. The route intersects [[New York State Route 631|NY&nbsp;631]] before leaving Baldwinsville and heading into another rural section of Lysander. This open stretch ends at the canalside [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of Cold Springs, which serves as the beginning of the Syracuse suburbs. After passing through the community, NY&nbsp;370 crosses over the conjoined Erie Canal and Seneca River and enters the town of [[Salina, New York|Salina]]. Not far from the canal is a junction with John Glenn Boulevard, a four-lane arterial connecting NY&nbsp;370 to [[Interstate&nbsp;690]] (I-690).<ref name="yahoo" />

Past John Glenn Boulevard, NY&nbsp;370 passes over the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90 in New York|Interstate&nbsp;90]] or I-90) near exit&nbsp;38 and begins to approach the northern shore of [[Onondaga Lake]] as it enters the village of [[Liverpool, New York|Liverpool]] on 2nd Street. In the village's commercial center, NY&nbsp;370 intersects Oswego Street, which connects to I-90,<ref name="yahoo" /> once part of [[New York State Route 57|NY&nbsp;57]]<ref name="1981map" /> and now [[New York State Route 931G|NY&nbsp;931G]], an unsigned [[reference route (New York)|reference route]].<ref name="2009log" /> Here, NY&nbsp;370 turns onto Oswego Street for one block before veering southeastward onto Onondaga Lake Parkway, a four-lane highway running along the northeastern shoreline of Onondaga Lake. This section of the route also parallels the [[CSX Transportation]]-owned [[St. Lawrence Subdivision]], which crosses the highway by way of a low, {{convert|10|ft|9|in|sing=on}} overpass {{convert|1|mi|1}} southeast of Liverpool.<ref name="yahoo" />

The parkway ends {{convert|2|mi|1}} from Liverpool at the eastern tip of the lake, where the route connects to [[Interstate 81 in New York|I-81]] at exit&nbsp;24. NY&nbsp;370 continues through the interchange, following the two-lane Park Street into the city of Syracuse. In its first few blocks in the city, the highway passes under the [[Mohawk Subdivision]]<U+2014>CSX's [[main line (railway)|main line]] across [[Central New York]]<U+2014>and serves both [[NBT Bank Stadium]] and the [[Central New York Regional Market]]. East of the market, the route continues for one more block through an industrial area of Syracuse to Wolf Street, where NY&nbsp;370 ends at [[U.S. Route 11 in New York|US&nbsp;11]] and [[New York State Route 298 Truck|NY&nbsp;298 Truck]] {{convert|1.5|mi|1}} northwest of [[downtown Syracuse]].<ref name="yahoo" />

[[File:NY 370 west at NY 631.jpg|thumb|left|NY&nbsp;370 west at NY&nbsp;631 in Baldwinsville]]
The portion of NY&nbsp;370 east of Oswego Street in [[Liverpool, New York|Liverpool]] was originally designated as part of Route&nbsp;34, an unsigned [[legislative route]], in 1908.<ref name="1909book">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jZ0AAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA64 |author=State of New York Department of Highways |title=The Highway Law |year=1909 |publisher=J.

West of Victory, NY&nbsp;40 followed Upton Road and Canada Street before terminating at [[New York State Route 3|NY&nbsp;3]] (now [[New York State Route 104A|NY&nbsp;104A]]) in [[Red Creek, New York|Red Creek]].<ref name="1924nyt" /><ref name="1926map">{{cite map |title=Official Map Showing State Highways and other important roads |year=1926 |publisher=[[State of New York Department of Public Works]] |cartography=Rand McNally and Company}}</ref>

Although the portion of what is now NY&nbsp;370 from Cato to Liverpool was state-maintained by 1926,<ref name="1926map" /> it remained unnumbered until the late 1920s. At that time, the section west of then-[[New York State Route 31|NY&nbsp;31]] (now [[New York State Route 48|NY&nbsp;48]]) in Baldwinsville became NY&nbsp;37. The designation proved to be short-lived as it was renumbered to NY&nbsp;370 as part of the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]].<ref name="1930nyt">{{cite news |last=Dickinson |first=Leon A. |title=New Signs for State Highways |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 12, 1930 |page=136}}</ref><ref name="1927bb" /> At the same time, NY&nbsp;40 was split into several different routes. From Cato to just east of Red Creek, old NY&nbsp;40 became part of the new NY&nbsp;370, which also extended southeastward to NY&nbsp;57 in Liverpool. The small segment of former NY&nbsp;40 from NY&nbsp;3 to Upton Road was included in [[New York State Route 3E (1930<U+2013>1932)|NY&nbsp;3E]] (later [[U.S. Route 104|US&nbsp;104]]).<ref>{{cite map |title=Road Map of New York |year=1930 |publisher=[[Standard Oil Company of New York]] |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref>

The portion of NY&nbsp;370 west of Victory was realigned in the late 1950s to follow its modern alignment to a new terminus at US&nbsp;104 ([[Ridge Road (Western New York)|Ridge Road]]) southwest of Red Creek.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York with Special Maps of Putnam<U+2013>Rockland<U+2013>Westchester Counties and Finger Lakes Region |publisher=[[Esso]] |cartography=General Drafting |edition=1958 |year=1958}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York and New Jersey Tourguide<!--sic--> Map |publisher=[[Gulf Oil Company]] |cartography=Rand McNally and Company |year=1960}}</ref> After US&nbsp;104 (now [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]]) was rerouted to follow a new [[super two]] highway through the Red Creek area in the early 1970s,<ref name="1971map">{{cite map |title=New York Thruway |publisher=[[New York State Thruway Authority]] |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |year=1971 |edition=10th}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Shell Oil Company]] |cartography=[[H.M.
