The '''[[Russian language]] in [[Israel]]''' is spoken by some 1 million people, about 20% of the total population,{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=95}} mostly by immigrants who came from the [[former Soviet Union]] in the early 1990s and later years.{{sfn|Shohamy|2006|p=70}}{{sfn|Pokorn|2010|p=116}}{{sfn|Grabe|2010|p=155}}{{sfn|Kohn|2007|p=416}} It is a major foreign language in the country and is used in many aspects of life. After English, Russian is by far the most widely spoken non-official language in Israel. The government and businesses often provide information in Russian, and it is semi-official in some areas with high concentration of [[Russian Jew]]ish immigrants.{{sfn|Isurin|2011|p=13}}{{sfn|Spolsky|1999|p=236}}

== History ==
The first Russian-speaking Soviet Jews arrived in Israel in the 1970s, but the "great migration" did not start until the late 1980s, during the last years of the Soviet Union. 

About 100,000 Jews emigrated from the Soviet Union to Israel from 1971 to 1974. Most of them were from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]; the Baltic states of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]; and areas annexed by the [[Red Army]] in 1939<U+2013>1940, mostly [[Poland]]. Soviet authorities allowed this emigration to take place by calling it "family reunification," in order to avoid the appearance that anyone was unhappy living in the Soviet state.{{sfn|Eisen|p=584}} These emigrants held strongly [[Zionist]] views and took the opportunity to settle in their historic homeland.{{sfn|Allan Jones|p=27}} Less than half of those who emigrated in the 1970s wave came from [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] countries, i.e., [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], even though about 80% of Soviet Jews lived there at the time.{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=97}} 

The Soviet Union was generally anti-Semitic; Zionist activities inside its borders were considered [[treason]] that could lead to execution, and, after 1967, Israel was considered an enemy state.{{sfn|Byford|p=63}} It was not until ''[[Perestroika]]'' that Jewish activists were given freedom to operate. The emigration that took place from 1989 to 1993 is described as a "panic migration", due to the socio-economic crisis in the Soviet states, rather than a migration of "born-again" Jews.{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=96}} Many of them did not have any relation to [[Judaism]] or [[Zionism]] in their former place of residence.{{sfn|Gordon|2007|p=78}} Most immigrants of this period came from Russia and Ukraine, and to a lesser extent from Belarus and Central Asia.{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=98}} 

The "old immigrants" of the 1970, who mainly came to Israel for Zionist feelings, viewed people who came during the wave of the 1980s and 90s as people escaping a harsh economic situation who did not have much appreciation for their new homeland.{{sfn|Isurin|2011|p=14}} The last Soviet census of 1989 indicated 1,449,000 Jews living in the country, of which about 877,000 had moved to Israel by October 2000. The wave of immigration in this short period of time was the greatest influx of people to Israel since the date of its creation.{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=95}} Immigrants from the former Soviet composed 50<U+2013>70% of the newcomers.{{sfn|Gordon|2007|p=78}} The number of people who came to Israel in the late 1980s and early 1990s outnumbered the number of people who came during the 1970s by four times, which made it harder for them to be integrated into the mainstream society of such a small country.{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=98}}

A significant portion of former Soviet immigrants are not Jewish. Many ethnic Russians used false papers to come to Israel, in order to improve their living standards and enhance their personal financial situation.{{sfn|Gordon|2007|p=78}} An estimated 250,000 of immigrants are not Jews, but rather non-Jewish relatives of Jewish immigrants who received Israeli citizenship according to the [[Law of Return]].{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=97}}

== Today ==
[[File:Israel Multilingual sign at beach.jpg|thumb|250px|A multilingual sign at the beach, forbidding swimming]]
Although Hebrew courses are offered to every immigrant, some Russians have refused. About 26% of Russian immigrants barely speak or cannot speak Hebrew at all.<ref>http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4335235,00.html</ref> Russians often settle close to each other, forming Russian-speaking neighborhoods with store window advertisements in Russian and banks with at least a few Russian-speaking workers.{{sfn|Gordon|2007|p=78}} 

The process of integration into mainstream Israeli society is slow, because most Russian-speaking adults refuse to learn Hebrew and are not willing to give up their Russian cultural background easily. 

The 2007 book ''Israel today'' describes the situation: 
{{cquote|They speak only Russian to their children. They read one of the seven Russian-language newspapers that Russian-speakers have established, and they watch the private Russian TV station that has been set up in Israel and Russian stations abroad. Even after living years in Israel, hundreds of thousands of these Russian-speakers cannot carry on telephone conversation in Hebrew; many thousands of them cannot ask for directions in Hebrew. Despite these inconvenience, many Russian-speaker continue to reject the Hebrew language wherever and whenever they can.{{sfn|Gordon|2007|p=79}} }}

Today, Russian is in a much better position than Arabic, which is an official language in the country.{{sfn|Pokorn|2010|p=119}} The Russian-speaking adult population, which is less competitive in Hebrew than the youth, mostly tries to preserve the common Russian cultural background, even teaching it to their Israeli-born children.{{sfn|Rebhun|2004|p=106}}

== Status and usage ==
[[File:Arad, Israel Multilingual sign bookstore.jpg|thumb|250px|A Russian bookstore in [[Arad, Israel|Arad]] ]]

[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are the only official languages of the State of Israel.

Russian and a number of other immigrant languages are widely used in Israel, due the fact that ethnic Jews from dozens of countries from all around the world have settled in the area. Russian is the major immigrant language of Jews living in Israel. Since 1967, millions of [[Russian Jews]] have settled in the country, and a great influx of Jews from the post-Soviet states took place in the 1990s. Today, Russian is used in cultural events, the educational system and other public domains.{{sfn|Pokorn|2010|p=116}}

By 1999, about 5 to 10% of all jobs in Israel were held by Russian speakers. The Ministry of Transport published booklets and manuals in Russian. It is very likely to find Russian-speaking doctors at hospitals.{{sfn|Spolsky|1999|p=237}}

== Education ==
Most Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union were highly educated{{sfn|Baker|1998|p=202}} with almost 45% of them having some kind of higher education.{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=96}}

Despite the fact that the native language of a significant part of the country's population is Russian, the language occupies a modest role in Israel's education system. [[Hebrew University]] started teaching Russian in 1962. In public schools, the first Russian-language classes were opened in the 1970s in large cities. The number of students enrolled in these programs dropped in the 1980s as immigration from the Soviet Union slowed down. In the 1990s, a Russian-language program carried out by local governments called ''Na'leh 16'' included some 1,500 students. In 1997, about 120 schools in Israel taught Russian in one way or another.{{sfn|Spolsky|1999|p=238}}

== Media ==
Traditionally, Russian speakers read newspapers and listen to radio more often than Hebrew speakers.{{sfn|Rebhun|2004|p=106}}

''Nasha strana'' was the major Russian-newspaper in Israel during the 1970s, when it competed with ''Tribuna'' for the immigrant reader.{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=99}} In 1989, there was only one daily in Russian, though the number grew to six by 1996.{{sfn|Spolsky|1999|p=237}} Since the 2000s, the number of Russian-language newspapers started to decline due to the increasing number of television and online media.{{sfn|LeVine|2012|p=317}} Israeli television provides translation in Hebrew, Arabic, and Russian on a daily basis.{{sfn|Pokorn|2010|p=117}} In 2002, the Israeli Russian-speaking commercial Channel 9 was launched. It is also known as [[Israel Plus]].{{sfn|LeVine|2012|p=317}} In November 2007, a typical digital package included 45 channels in foreign languages, with 5 in Russian.{{sfn|Pokorn|2010|p=117}} Today, there are four dailies, 11 weeklies, five monthlies and over 50 local newspapers published in Russian in Israel, with a total circulation of about 250,000 during weekends.{{sfn|Dowty|2004|p=99}} Daily radio services in Russian are also available throughout Israel.{{sfn|Baker|1998|p=202}}
