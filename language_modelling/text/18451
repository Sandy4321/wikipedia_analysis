The '''Don Valley Parkway (DVP)''' is a controlled-access six-lane [[expressway]] in [[Toronto]]. The expressway connects the [[Gardiner Expressway]] in [[downtown Toronto]] with [[Highway 401]]. North of Highway 401, the expressway continues as [[Ontario Highway 404|Highway 404]] to [[Newmarket, Ontario|Newmarket]]. It runs through the parklands of the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River valley]], after which it is named. The parkway is patrolled by the [[Toronto Police Service]] and has a maximum speed limit of {{convert|90|km/h|abbr=on}}. It is {{convert|15.0|km|abbr=on}} in length.<ref name="T&A" />

The parkway was the second expressway to be built by [[Metropolitan Toronto]] (Metro). Planning for it began in 1954, the year of Metro's formation. The first section opened in 1961 and the entire route was completed by the end of 1966. South of Bloor Street, the expressway was constructed over existing roadways. North of Bloor Street, the expressway was built on a new [[right-of-way (transportation)|alignment]] through the valley, requiring the removal of several hills, rerouting of the Don River and the clearing of green space. North of Eglinton Avenue, the expressway follows the former Woodbine Avenue right-of-way north to Highway 401.

The parkway operates well beyond its intended capacity of 60,000 vehicles per day and is known for its daily traffic jams; some sections carry an average of 100,000 vehicles per day. Planned as part of a larger expressway network within Toronto, it was one of the few expressways built before the public opposition which [[Cancelled expressways in Toronto|cancelled many of the others]].

== Route description ==
The Don Valley Parkway begins at an interchange with the Gardiner Expressway near the mouth of the Don River in downtown Toronto. From there, it runs northwards on the eastern bank of the valley, between the river and the developed city to the east. Beyond the southern, older section of the city, the valley widens and the expressway continues northwards through the park lands along the river to Don Mills Road. The route leaves the valley, rises to meet Eglinton Avenue, descends into the valley again and goes through the park lands of Milne Hollow to Lawrence Avenue. It ascends to meet York Mills Road and ends at [[Highway 401]].

=== South of the Forks ===
At its southern end near the mouth of the Don River, the parkway begins in a multiple-level interchange with the ground-level [[Lake Shore Boulevard]], and the elevated Gardiner Expressway directly above the Boulevard. The Gardiner<U+2013>Don Valley ramps provide access to the section of the Gardiner Expressway west of the parkway. There is no access either from or to the Gardiner east of the parkway. To travel east from the southbound lanes of the parkway, motorists must exit via the off-ramp to Lake Shore Boulevard, which meets the Lake Shore at a signalized intersection.<ref name="T&A" /><ref name="dvp-gard-interchange">{{Google maps|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Don+Valley+Parkway,+Toronto,+Ontario,+Canada&sll=41.948685,-73.86686&sspn=0.084774,0.148487&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Don+Valley+Pkwy,+Toronto,+Toronto+Division,+Ontario,+Canada&ll=43.651968,-79.347897&spn=0.005155,0.013368&t=h&z=17 |title=Don Valley/Gardiner Expressway interchange |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}</ref>

=== Traffic congestion ===
The Don Valley Parkway, along with the [[Gardiner Expressway]], is one of Toronto's busiest municipal routes. It is the sole north<U+2013>south expressway into Toronto's downtown, a role it was not designed to support. The parkway was planned as one of a series of expressways to provide commuter routes to downtown from the expanding suburbs. Two other un-built expressways were planned: the [[Scarborough Expressway]], expected to handle traffic between downtown and the eastern suburbs, and the [[Spadina Expressway]], expected to serve traffic from the north-west.<ref name="400ext">{{cite book

The section immediately south of Highway 401 is often congested. Traffic studies have attributed congestion in the southbound lanes to the number of lanes merging from Highways 401 and 404 into the parkway and the lane changing that results from merging traffic from Highway 401 clashing with exiting traffic to the nearby York Mills exit.<ref>City of Toronto (2004), ''Don Valley Corridor Report'', pp. 87<U+2013>88</ref> Congestion in the northbound lanes is attributed to truck traffic coping with the steep grade of the valley, lane changing, and insufficient advanced signage for Highway 401. Most traffic in this section travels north on Highway 404, but only two of the five lanes lead to it.<ref>City of Toronto (2004), ''Don Valley Corridor Report'', pp. 89<U+2013>90</ref>

== History ==
The construction of the Don Valley Parkway was a major undertaking that changed much of the Don valley. While industrial areas existed both near the mouth of the Don River and the area of today's Leaside Bridge, several natural areas remained in those places where the steep sides of the valley had dissuaded large-scale urban development. The post-war growth period of Toronto provided an impetus to build a new automobile route into central Toronto, and the route through the valley was chosen to avoid expropriation of existing development and provide access for new development in the Metropolitan Toronto region. The construction of the six-lane highway modified the valley through the removal of hills, other earth works and the rerouting of the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]]. Since completion, the parkway has not been changed significantly, other than adding one partial interchange at Wynford Drive and updating its infrastructure to current standards.

===Conditions before construction===
[[File:DVP from Midtown.png|thumb|right|alt=A six lane highway descends into a forested valley, ascending out of the valley in the distance.|The parkway descends into Milne Hollow in the East Don Valley near Lawrence Avenue.]]
The Don River valley, formed during the last ice age, has played an important role in the development of Toronto from its beginning as the [[York, Upper Canada|Town of York]]. Using the power of the river, the first sawmill was erected at today's Todmorden Mills by 1795{{sfn|Darke|1995|p=27}} and other industry was founded soon after, including a grist mill, paper mill and brewery by 1828.{{sfn|Darke|1995|p=57}} Railways were introduced into the valley after 1850 with the building of railways into Toronto. By 1900, the Don River south of today's Bloor Street was straightened into a channel for boating purposes, with roadways and industry built on both banks.<ref name="cot-bbtd">{{cite web |publisher=City of Toronto |title=City of Toronto: Bring Back the Don, The Story of the Don |url=http://www.toronto.ca/don/watershed.htm |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}</ref> North of Bloor Street, the wide valley floor became dominated by industrial concerns of the Taylor family, including the [[Don Valley Brick Works]].{{sfn|Darke|1995|pp=85<U+2013>86}} The area from the Forks of the Don and north along the river valleys had been lumbered and farmed, such as at Milne Hollow, but several natural areas remained by the 1950s.{{sfn|Sauriol|1984|p=138}}

The Don Valley Parkway was not the first highway planned through the valley. In the 1930s, a "speedway" through the lower valley was promoted as possible depression relief. Unlike today's parkway, this road would have curved northwest near the Don Valley Brick Works and connected to Mount Pleasant at Davisville.{{sfn|Filey|2006|pp=151<U+2013>153}} The city did not have the money and appealed to 'civic-minded citizens' to donate the land on which the highway would be built. None came forward.{{sfn|Filey|2006|p=153}} In 1939, city transportation planner Norman Wilson proposed a boulevard that would follow the valley into the northeast.{{sfn|Sewell|2009|p=15}} In 1946, Toronto voters approved building a 'Don Valley Traffic Artery' following the same route as the "speedway" in the same plebiscite where Toronto voters approved the construction of the [[Yonge-University-Spadina|Yonge Subway]].{{sfn|Filey|2006|p=153}}<ref>{{cite news

In 1957, the [[Toronto and Region Conservation Authority|Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority]] (MTRCA) was formed, merging all conservation authorities responsible for Toronto watersheds (including the DVCA), with greater powers to manage valley lands.{{sfn|Rus|1998|p=28}} The MTRCA began [[expropriating]] privately-owned land in the valley for flood control, often creating or conserving open space uses.

=== Construction ===
[[File:DVP with downtown in background.png|thumb|left|alt=A six lane highway winds into a forested valley, with many buildings atop the plateau surrounding the valley|The parkway, facing south with downtown visible in the distance]]
The design of the project was contracted to the engineering consortium of Fenco-Harris, which completed the plans in the fall of 1955. The project included extending [[Bayview Avenue]] south along the Lower Don valley, and the realignment of [[Lawrence Avenue]] over the East Don River. The design for the section north of the Don River mouth incorporated the existing river-side Don Roadway on the east side of the River. The design also incorporated  a section of the old Don Mills Road leading up from the River, north of Gerrard, to Broadview Avenue and Danforth Avenue into the highway as a northbound on-ramp from Danforth. The project was designed to carry 60,000 vehicles per day.<ref name="ts25"/> Fenco-Harris designed the route to be "located on public lands as much as possible, thus minimizing the expropriation of private property. Greenbelt land has been used for right-of-way in preference to acreage which can be commercially developed." The route required the expropriation of less than 25 properties.<ref>{{cite news

The first planned route of the parkway was to follow the lower Don Valley before turning north and continuing along the Don Mills Road [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] north to the Toronto Bypass (today's Highway 401). [[Edward P. Taylor]], developer of the [[Don Mills, Ontario|Don Mills]] subdivision, situated at Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue, protested the plan heavily and the path was rerouted along the CPR railway from Don Mills Road and Eglinton Avenue north-east to meet the Woodbine Avenue right-of-way at Lawrence Avenue, and proceeded north to the Toronto Bypass. To facilitate the [[Flemingdon Park]] development, located south-east of Don Mills Road and Eglinton, the entire planned route south of Lawrence to the present interchange at Don Mills Road was moved east to its current alignment.<ref name="concrete">McClelland, Stewart (2007) pp. 242<U+2013>243</ref>

In the first five months of 1965, there were 136 accidents on the parkway, with four deaths and 86 injuries. Among the "death-dealing" deficiencies that had to be corrected were inadequate guardrails, exposed steep slopes and [[street light|light standards]] that were exposed to collision from passing high-speed traffic.<ref name="ts25"/> Call boxes with emergency telephones were installed on the parkway in 1966.<ref name="caa-callboxes">{{cite web

The ramp connecting Wynford with the northbound parkway required a tunnel under the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) Midtown railway lines.

From 1986 to 1988, the City studied traffic congestion in the 'Don Valley Corridor', an area from Leslie Street east to [[Victoria Park Avenue]].

In 1989, a public meeting was held on the future of the Don River, which was widely known for its pollution, and the Don Valley, considered an "industrial wasteland"<ref name="cot-bbtd"/> and which had seen its last industrial use (the Taylor, later Domtar, Paper Mill) close in 1982.<ref name="cot-bbtd"/> The Toronto City Council formed the "Task Force to Bring Back the Don", an organization of volunteers to work on conservation efforts in the Don Valley. Since that time, the task force has planted some 40,000 trees in the valley, planted thousands of wildflowers and overseen the creation of wetlands along the river.<ref name="cot-bbtd"/> Efforts continue to ameliorate the water quality of the river and improve the environment of the surrounding valley lands.<ref name="cot-bbtd"/> These efforts can be seen in the "Crother's Woods" north of Bloor Street and the Chester Marsh just south of Bloor Street, alongside the parkway.<ref name="cot-bbtd-wet">{{cite web |publisher=City of Toronto |title=City of Toronto: Bring Back the Don, Wetlands are the Best Lands |url= |accessdate=August 11,2010}}</ref>

In 2001, Toronto City Councillor Paul Sutherland proposed to add two toll lanes in each direction along the parkway, from Highway 401 to Eglinton Avenue.
