'''Bob Enyart''' is an [[United States|American]] [[television]] and [[radio]] [[talk show]] host, [[pastor]] and author, based since the 1980s in [[Denver, Colorado]]. 

Enyart is a conservative, [[Christian]], and frequently introduces himself as ''"America<U+2019>s most popular self proclaimed [[right-wing]], religious fanatic, homophobic, anti-choice talk show host".''

==Biography==
===Formative years===
Enyart was born [[1959]], of [[Italian people|Italian]] descent, and was raised [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]]. He attended both Catholic and [[public school]]s. He attended [[Arizona State University]], majoring in [[computer science]], and worked as a technician for [[McDonnell Douglas]] upon graduation. 

===Religious===
In September [[1973]], at age 14, Enyart converted from being a practising Catholic to fundamentalist Christianity, and was actively involved in evangelizing other teenagers while in high school. In the mid-[[1980s]], Enyart embraced Christian fundamentalism and left the corporate world behind.

===Broadcasting career===
Enyart gained attention with a local talk show, '''''Bob Enyart Live''''', on a small [[AM radio]] station in Denver, before taking his show to [[television]] via religious broadcaster [[LeSEA|LeSea Broadcasting]]'s local station [[KWHD|KWHD-TV]].  Later, LeSea would air Enyart nationwide on their network of television stations.  

On his show, Enyart combines confrontation, evangelism and humor to discuss current events, morality, government and criminal justice from a biblical perspective. The show is home to frequent debates on many various theological/doctrinal issues.  Topics range from forgiveness to judgement, to debating different denominational exegesis such as [[Calvinism]].  Bob Enyart proudly directly quoting of various scriptures to help drive home different points. Before a verse is read, Enyart recites a warning to all listening that "pure unadulterated truth is about to be uttered." His opening line is "Greetings to the brightest audience in the country."

LeSea which had been carrying ''Bob Enyart Live'' free of charge on their network, eventually dropped Enyart's show after gaining a paying customer for his time slot. A lack of funds forced Enyart to discontinue televised broadcasts. Later, Enyart would admit that his hesitancy to ask for donations was the cause of the television show<U+2019>s cancellation. Bob Enyart Live has been revived and is currently being carried on [[KLTT|KLTT-AM]] in Denver.

===Personal life===
His first wife and fellow religious activist, Krista filed for [[divorce]] in [[1989]]. While their marriage undoubtedly suffered from their arrests and jail time as a result of 'Operation Rescue', Enyart has claimed it ended due to his own struggles with sexual immorality and pornography. Krista agreed to give Enyart custody of their two boys. Enyarts second marriage would also end quickly in divorce.

During his TV show's nationwide run, Enyart married Cheryl Mayns, the ex-wife of a [[Jefferson County, Colorado]] sheriff's deputy.  Enyart was charged in [[1994]] and ultimately convicted of [[misdemeanor]] [[child abuse]] in the striking of Mayns' son Steven (then age 7) with a belt, leaving bruises and welts on the boy's buttocks.

Enyart regained custody of his sons from his first marriage in [[1999]] after his ex-wife Krista died.  They are involved with the design and operation of Enyart's websites.  Enyart is currently the pastor of Denver Bible Church in [[Denver, Colorado]].  

==Religious views==
Enyart speaks his mind harshly, humorously and occasionally (and admittedly) disrespectfully where he deems appropriate.  Enyart<U+2019>s motto "Do right and risk the consequences" is indicative of his style of argument and evangelism, he prefers to speak what he believes to be truth, regardless of the possibility that he may offend, or worse.

He advocates for a [[Constitutional Monarchy]] under the leadership of a [[monarch|King]], and would exclude a woman from becoming a [[Queen regnant|regnant]]. In an article published in the Denver weekly newspaper [[Westword]], Enyart said that "it's natural that men lead the household" and that households that are led by women turn out to be an "unhappy household." He also calls for the establishment of a criminal code under the [[Old Testament]] (or the [[Mosaic Law]] as Enyart likes to emphasize) as national law which includes the [[death penalty]] for offences such as [[homosexuality]], [[murder]], [[attempted murder]], [[adultery]] and [[abortion]].

Homosexuality was frequently singled out for criticism by Enyart, who sold T-shirts imprinted with the slogan ''"Homos Make Me Sick"'', and once played the song by the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]" as the names of [[AIDS]] victims scrolled by on the screen.

Enyart criticizes even the most right-wing conservatives, citing rulings and/or behaviors indicative of liberalism.  He has openly denounced and rebuked Supreme Court judge [[Samuel Alito]] and [[Dr. James Dobson]] for allegedly compromising on various conservative values and engaging in [[Legal Positivism]].

==Activism==
In [[1989]], Enyart became the director of Operation Rescue Colorado, the state chapter of the [[anti-abortion|pro life]] group [[Operation Rescue]] and was arrested numerous times during their non-violent "rescue" events attempting to prevent pregnant women from entering abortion clinics. Enyart's first wife, Krista, also participated in Operation Rescue and was also arrested at protests. Enyart resigned from Operation Rescue when he realized his marriage was in jeopardy. 

Enyart and members of his church have been active in picketing (and in some instances, being arrested) throughout the Denver area and elsewhere, to as far as Auckland New Zealand where they protested former U.S. President Bill Clinton for allegedly raping campaign supporter Juanita Broaddrick back in 1978.  Locally, Denver Bible Church members have participated in a protest in front of a [[Dairy Queen]] restaurant owned by  [[pro-choice]] Colorado Senator [[Ken Salazar]] and his wife.  Denver Bible Church members also participated in protests outside the [[Florida]] [[Hospice care|hospice]] where [[Terri Schiavo]] was taken off her feeding tube. 

Enyart has taken place in two debates on the [http://theologyonline.com theologyonline] discussion forum.  He was declared the winner of "Battle Royale VII: Does God exist?" (defending the affirmative) by technical knock out when rival atheist and former Christian pastor "Zakath" dropped out in the 9th round.  Enyart won "Battle Royale X: Does God know your entire future?" defending [[open theism]] against Dr. Samuel Lamerson by reader poll.

Enyart has endorsed Larry Kilgore, 2008 Republican primary candidate for Texas U.S. Senate.<ref>[http://www.larrykilgore.com/Endorsements.htm Endorsements]</ref>, and his shadowgov.com website is credited in Kilgore's <ref>[http://www.larrykilgore.com/Issues.html Issues]</ref> issues section. Enyart is a member of Colorado Right to Life, which was ousted from the [[National Right to Life Committee]] in June 2007 after criticizing [[James Dobson]].

==Controversy over published works==
Enyart authored ''"The First Five Days: The Rebirth of America",'' a fictional account of the first five days of God's criminal code being adopted in the U.S.A. by Enyart's ideal of a Christian "[[shadow government]]", and sold it through his TV and radio shows.  In [[1998]], [[Amazon.com]] dropped Enyart from its affiliate program and stopped selling his book after protests from [[gay rights]] advocates. Enyart has stated of his shadow government "It almost certainly will never take over. But we want to be prepared, just in case."

Enyart later began [[webcast]]ing a talk show on his websites KGOV.com and shadowgov.com where he continues to sell his books, Bible studies and other ministry materials.  In a promotion for his new [[internet]] venture, he spent about $20,000 purchasing [[O.J. Simpson]]'s memorabilia at a bankruptcy auction and at noon the next day, burned Simpson's Hall of Fame Award on the steps of the Los Angeles courthouse.  He has entered many public venues to discuss spanking and his child abuse trial, including 3 episodes of ABC's [[Politically Incorrect]] with Bill Maher, and Fox News Channel's [[The O'Reilly Factor]] with Bill O'Reilly, and the radio syndicated [[The Sean Hannity Show]].

==Trivia==
Enyart is the first cousin of [[Michael Galluccio]], one of two  homosexual men who became the first [[homosexuality|homosexual]] couple to legally adopt a child in the state of [[New Jersey]].
