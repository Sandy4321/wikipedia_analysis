'''Bilston Town Hall''' is an iconic Grade II Listed venue dating back to 1872 in [[West Midlands]], United Kingdom. After closing down in 1996, it was reopened in 2008 following a <U+00A3>2.5 million restoration and is now managed by Gazebo Theatre in Education Company as an independent venue. 

==History==
Built in 1872, Bilston Town Hall was designed by architects Bidlake and Lovatt.{{who}} A free library and reading room were also added soon after and further extensions took place in 1882. The building became the Bilston Urban District Council House in 1894 and the Bilston Borough Council House in 1933. The Town Hall saw many other uses, especially during the golden age of film in Wolverhampton. The ball room on the first floor was, at one time, leased to Professor Woods as a cinema. When he built Wood's Palace, on the other side of the road, the ballroom reverted to its original use and was used for regular dances as well as special functions. Night classes were also held at the town hall teaching subjects such as science and languages.

In 1966 Bilston Town was incorporated into the new county Borough of [[Wolverhampton]]. The town hall was closed in 1996 when it fell into disuse, and very soon after a local movement started to preserve it. Following 12 years of local pressure and <U+00A3>2.5 million restoration, the Grade II listed venue was re-opened with new tenants, Wolverhampton Homes and Gazebo Theatre in Education.
