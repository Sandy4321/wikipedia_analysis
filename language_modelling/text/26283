It is bounded to the north west by [[Victoria River Downs]], the north east by [[Camfield Station]], to the east by Cattle Creek Station and the south east by Moray Downs. Area to the south and west are Aboriginal Land holdings.<ref name=WHLand/>

==History==

The [[Indigenous Australian|traditional owners]] of the lands are the Gurindji peoples,<ref>{{cite book|title=Stories from Australia's history: Vincent Lingiari and the Wave Hill Walkout|author=Melanie Guile|year=2013|publisher=Macmillan Education|ISBN=9781458642042}}</ref> who have lived in the area for approximately 60,000 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://austhrutime.com/malakunanja.htm|title=Australia: The Land Where Time Began|author=M. H. Munroe|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref>

The area was first explored by Europeans in 1854 by [[Augustus Charles Gregory]], and later in 1879 by [[Alexander Forrest]] during his journey from the coast of [[Western Australia]] to the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line|Overland Telegraph Line]]. Both Wave Hill and [[Victoria River Downs Station|Victoria River Downs]] were established in 1883.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-factsheet/victoria-river-20081113-5yze.html|title=Victoria River|publisher=[[Sydney morning herald]]|date=2 December 2010|accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref>

By 1888 Buchanan was moving cattle off Wave Hill and to another holding, Sturt's Creek Station, where he was fattening the cattle for butchering on-site. This was providing prime fresh beef, at 6d per pound, to the men at the nearby [[gold]] diggings and at the port at [[Wyndham, Western Australia|Wyndham]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3312401 |title=Kimberley News |newspaper=[[The Northern Territory Times]] |location=Darwin, Northern Territory |date=10 March 1888 |accessdate=14 January 2013 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

The station manager in 1891 was Sam Johnston also known as ''Greenhide Sam'' who was described as ''as thorough a bushman as can be found in all of Australia''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48104584 |title=Central Australian Exploration. |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide, South Australia |date=2 April 1891 |accessdate=14 January 2013 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

Buchanan put the property up for [[auction]] in 1894, advertising the property as being {{convert|1100|sqmi|km2|0}} of high open downs, [[basalt]] plains with rich black soil covered in with [[mitchell grass]]. Wave Hill was stocked with horses and 15,000 head of cattle, of which 8,000 bullocks were ready for market.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article33102216 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[Western Mail (Western Australia)|Western Mail]] |location=Perth, Western Australia |date=16 December 1893 |accessdate=14 January 2013 |page=23 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

The [[explorer]] and [[author]], [[Michael Terry]], passed through Wave Hill as part of his expedition to drive from [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]] in [[Western Australia]] to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in 1927.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21837768 |title=From Darwin to Broome. |newspaper=[[Courier-Mail|The Brisbane Courier-Mail]] |location=Queensland. |date=28 May 1927 |accessdate=15 January 2013 |page=22 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

Following the disappearance of the [[Southern Cross (aircraft)|Southern Cross]] that was piloted by [[Charles Kingsford Smith]] in early April 1929 as part of the flight from [[Sydney]] to [[Wyndham, Western Australia|Wyndham]], messages had been sent using the Wave Hill wireless station.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32269970 |title=Story of the flight |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth, Western Australia |date=2 April 1929 |accessdate=15 January 2013 |page=15 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Several search-planes went to look for the ''Southern Cross'' including the ''Kookaburra'', flown by Leiutentant Keith Anderson with mechanic R. Hitchcock, which took off from [[Alice Springs]] on 10 April. The ''Kookaburra'' never landed at Wave Hill to resupply and was declared missing.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article96064422 |title=Kookaburra missing. |newspaper=[[Recorder (newspaper)|Recorder]] |location=Port Pirie, South Australia |date=12 April 1929 |accessdate=15 January 2013 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The ''Southern Cross'' was found 12 April on mudflats at the mouth of the [[Glenelg River (Western Australia)|Glenelg River]] in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] region of [[Western Australia]].

The station was struck by [[drought]] in 1932 with many [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] drying up and cattle being in poor condition. 4,200 head of Wave Hill stock had to be [[quarantine]]d at Anthony's Lagoon after an outbreak of [[pleuro-pneumonia]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21978938 |title=Drought in North-West. |newspaper=[[Courier-Mail|The Brisbane Courier]] |location=Queenlsnd. |date=17 August 1932 |accessdate=15 January 2013 |page=13 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

[[Shorthorn]] cattle were introduced into the herd in 1935. Sixteen bulls were brought in from Queensland and it was hoped that breeding with the shorthorn would improve the quality of the herd.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36767547 |title=Shorthorn bulls for Territory |newspaper=[[Courier-Mail|The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane, Queensland. |date=19 June 1935 |accessdate=15 January 2013 |page=19 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

Another drought struck in 1936 when the [[monsoon]] failed to deliver any significant rain, Wave Hill lost about one quarter of its stock from lack of water and feed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47754302 |title=NT suffering from drought |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide, South Australia |date=22 October 1936 |accessdate=15 January 2013 |page=12 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

[[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] station workers were ready to walk off the station in 1938 as a result of a shortage of food stuffs available to them over the [[wet season]]. Potatoes, onions and other essential commodities were not supplied in violation of the [[Pastoral Award]]. The station owners transferred the workers to other properties.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49447598 |title=Wave Hill Station |newspaper=[[Northern Standard (Darwin, NT)|Northern Standard]] |location=Darwin, Northern Territory |date=29 April 1938 |accessdate=14 January 2013 |page=13 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

Following another [[drought]] in 1954 most of the stock were [[droving|droved]] to [[Helen Springs Station]]. Six mobs of cattle each with about 1,300 head most of which were in very poor condition had to make the long trek of about {{convert|400|mi|km|0}} with very little grass available along the way. It was expected that only about 60% of the stock would survive the trip.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48111313 |title=Dramatic Bid To Save Station's Dying Cattle. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide, South Australia |date=23 April 1954 |accessdate=15 January 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

===Wave Hill Walk-Off===
{{Main|Gurindji strike}}
Wave Hill is best known for the Wave Hill Walk-Off or [[Gurindji strike]], referring to the walk-off and strike by 200 [[Gurindji people|Gurindji]] stockmen, house servants and their families in August 1966. The strike lasted until 1975 when the federal [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government of [[Gough Whitlam]] finally negotiated with Vesteys to give the Gurindji back a {{convert|3236|km2|sqmi|0}} portion of their land, a landmark in the [[Native title|land rights]] movement in Australia for [[Indigenous Australians]].<ref name="WHWO"/>
