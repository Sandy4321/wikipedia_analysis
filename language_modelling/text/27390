'''''A Treatise on the Astrolabe''''' is a [[medieval]] [[essay]] on the [[astrolabe]] by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]. It begins:

:Lyte Lowys my sone, I aperceyve wel by certeyne evydences thyn abilite to lerne sciences touching nombres and proporciouns; and as wel considre I thy besy praier in special to lerne the tretys of the Astrelabie. Than for as moche as a philosofre saith, "he wrappith him in his frend, that condescendith to the rightfulle praiers of his frend," therfore have I yeven the a suffisant Astrolabie as for oure orizonte, compowned after the latitude of Oxenforde; upon which, by mediacioun of this litel tretys, I purpose to teche the a certein nombre of conclusions aperteynyng to the same instrument.

or, in a more modern English spelling,

:Little Lewis my son, I perceive well by certain evidences thine ability to learn sciences touching numbers and [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportions]]; and as well consider I thy constant prayer in special to learn the treatise of the Astrolabe. Than for as much as a philosopher saith, "He wrappth him in his friend, that condescendth to the rightful prayers of his friend", therefore have I given thee a suffisant Astrolabe as for our horizons, compounded after the latitude of [[Oxford]]; upon which, by means of this little treatise, I purpose to teach thee a certain number of conclusions pertaining to the same instrument.

According to the introduction, the work was to have five parts:
#A description of the astrolabe
#A rudimentary course in using the instrument
#Various tables of [[longitude]]s, [[latitude]]s, [[declination]]s, etc.
#A "theorike" ([[theory]]) of the motion of the [[celestial bodies]], in particular a table showing the "very moving of the [[moon]]"
#An introduction to the broader field of "astrologie," a word which at the time referred to the entire span of what we now divide into [[astrology and astronomy]].

However, Chaucer only completed parts 1 and 2, plus a small collection of "Supplementary Propositions". 

The ''Treatise'' is considered the oldest work in [[English language|English]] describing a complex scientific instrument, and is admired for its clarity in explaining difficult concepts<U+2014>although since the astrolabe and related tools are no longer in common use, much of it is difficult for modern readers to understand.
