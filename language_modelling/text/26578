The '''Kandahar massacre''' occurred in the early morning of Sunday, 11 March 2012, when sixteen civilians were killed and six wounded in the [[Panjwayi District]] of [[Kandahar Province]], [[Afghanistan]].  Nine of the victims were children, and eleven of the dead were from the same family. Some of the corpses were partially burned. [[United States Army]] [[Staff Sergeant]] [[Robert Bales]] was taken into custody and charged with 17 counts of [[premeditated murder]] and six counts of assault and attempted murder.  The charge was later reduced to 16 counts, due to the double counting of one victim.

United States authorities said the killings were the act of a single soldier. Some eyewitnesses reported seeing multiple soldiers but others reported seeing only one.  Some eyewitnesses also said they had seen helicopter support.  On 15 March, an Afghan parliamentary probe team made up of several members of the [[National Assembly of Afghanistan]] speculated that up to 20 American soldiers were involved in the killings.  The team later said they could not confirm that multiple soldiers took part in the killings.

The American and [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) authorities apologized for the incident and promised a thorough and quick investigation.  Afghan authorities condemned the act, describing it as "intentional murder".  The [[National Assembly of Afghanistan]] passed a resolution demanding a [[public trial]], which was also demanded by Afghan demonstrators.  On 13 March 2012, the [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] said the soldier would be tried under U.S. military law.  On 1 June 2012, the U.S. Army brought additional charges against Bales related to misconduct.

One of the families targeted in the Kandahar shootings had returned to the area in 2011 after previous being displaced by the surge. Fearing the Taliban but encouraged by the U.S. government, the Army, and the Afghan government, they settled near the American military base because they thought it would to be a safe place to live.<ref name=home/><ref>{{cite news |title=Afghan Massacre: After Losing Homes in NATO Attacks, Victims Moved Near U.S. Base Hoping for Safety |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2012/3/14/after_afghan_massacre_grievers_left_to |work=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=14 March 2012 |accessdate=15 March 2012}}</ref>

Approximately three weeks before the incidents, [[Afghanistan<U+2013>United States relations|U.S.<U+2013>Afghan relations]] were strained by an incident where [[2012 Afghanistan Quran burning protests|copies of the Quran were burnt]] at the [[Bagram Air Base]].  A couple months before the shootings, U.S. Marines were [[Video of US troops urinating on Taliban fighters|videotaped urinating]] on dead Taliban fighters.

=== Allegations of issues at Fort Lewis ===
The alleged shooter, [[Robert Bales]], was based at [[Joint Base Lewis-McChord]] (JBLM).  The primary medical treatment facility at the base, [[Madigan Army Medical Center]], has come under investigation for downgrading diagnoses of soldiers with [[PTSD]] to lesser ailments.  Military support groups around the base have alleged that base commanders did not give returning troops sufficient time to recover before sending them on further deployments, and that the base's medical staff is understaffed and overwhelmed by the numbers of returning veterans with deployment-related medical and psychological trauma.<ref name="clues"/><ref name=finn>{{cite news |title=Shooting Of Civilians Refocuses Attention On Lewis-McChord Base

Soldiers from the base have been linked to other atrocities and crimes. The 2010 [[Maywand District murders]] involved JBLM-based soldiers.<ref name=clues /> Also in 2010, a recently discharged [[AWOL]] soldier from JBLM shot a police officer in [[Salt Lake City]].<ref>Murphy, Kim, "Soldier Held In Killings Is From A Troubled Base", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 13 March 2012, p. 1.</ref>  In April 2011, a JBLM soldier killed his wife and 5-year-old son before killing himself.<ref name=finn/> In January 2012, a JBLM soldier murdered a [[Mount Rainier National Park]] ranger.<ref name=clues>Whitlock, Craig, and Carol D.

Jorge Gonzalez, executive director of a veterans resource center near Fort Lewis, said that the Kandahar killings offer more proof that the base is dysfunctional: "This was not a rogue soldier. JBLM is a rogue base, with a severe leadership problem", he said in a statement.<ref name=katu>{{cite web|url=http://www.katu.com/news/national/Report-Soldier-accused-in-Afghan-killings-from-Lewis-McChord-142249635.html |title=Lewis-McChord soldier accused in killings of Afghan civilians |publisher=[[KATU]] |date=11 March 2012}}</ref> Base officials responded, saying that the crimes committed by its soldiers were isolated events which do not "reflect on the work and dedication of all service members."<ref>{{cite news |title=Lt.

A patrol was dispatched to find the missing soldier, but did not find him before he returned to base after the killings. He was reportedly taken into custody without incident.

American investigators suspect that the shooter may have departed the base before midnight, committed the murders in Balandi, then returned to the base around 1:30 a.m.  The shooter may have then departed the base at 2:30 a.m. and committed the murders in Alkozai.
