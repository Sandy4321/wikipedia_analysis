'''Aubrey Herbert Carrigan''' (born [[August 26]], [[1917]] in [[Zillmere, Queensland|Zillmere]]) is a former Australian [[first-class cricket]]er who played with [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] in the [[Sheffield Shield]].

==Career==
Carrigan, a middle order batsman and part time medium pace bowler, made his first-class debut in the 1945/46 season but had to wait until the following summer to make his first Sheffield Shield appearance as the competition had been in recess due to the war. It wasn't until his 20th first-class match that he made a century, an innings of 166 against South Australia in Brisbane, although he had previously amassed a pair of 90s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/18/18352.html| title=Queensland v South Australia 1947/48| publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}</ref> 

His bowling was used to good effect on occasions and he claimed 14 wickets at 30.92 in 1948/49.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/8/8413/f_Bowling_by_Season.html| title=First-class Bowling in Each Season by Aub Carrigan| publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}</ref> During his career he dismissed batsman to the calibre of [[Neil Harvey]] and [[Arthur Morris]].
 
==Captaincy==
After filling in for two matches in 1950/51, Carrigan was Queensland's captain for the entire 1951/52 Sheffield Shield season, where they finished equal second on the points table.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/Sheffield_Shield_1951-52.html| title=Sheffield Shield 1951/52 Table| publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}</ref> He also had the distinction of captaining his state to a first-class win over the [[West Indian cricket team in Australia in 1951<U+2013>52|touring West Indians]], who had won their last two Test series, in England in India respectively. They played a four day match, as a warm up for the 1st Test at the [[The Gabba|Brisbane Cricket Ground]] later in the week. A six wicket haul to [[Colin McCool]] restricted the tourists to just 198 in their first innings and Queensland, in reply, would amass 455 runs. Carrigan had come to the crease at 2-184 and went on to score 169 of the remaining 271 runs, before being bowled by [[Gerry Gomez]], with a new highest first-class score. The West Indies again struggled in the second innings, with another six wicket performance, this time to Mick Raymer, leaving the Queenslanders requiring just 29 runs to win, which they achieved without losing a wicket.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/19/19998.html| title=Queensland v West Indians 1951/52| publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}</ref>

It was his last summer with Queensland and he spend the 1952 off-season in England playing for the [[Church and Oswaldtwistle Cricket Club]] in the [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/8/8413/Lancashire_League_Matches.html| title=Lancashire League Matches played by Aub Carrigan| publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}</ref>
