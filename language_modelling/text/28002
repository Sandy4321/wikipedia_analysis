'''State Route 266''' (SR 266) is a state highway in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. The route is a connector between [[Nevada State Route 264]] and [[Nevada State Route 266]], intersecting [[SR 168 (CA)|SR 168]] and thus providing a connection to the rest of the [[Owens Valley]]. Portions of the route were added to the state highway system in 1931, and became part of SR 168 in the [[1964 state highway renumbering (California)|1964 state highway renumbering]]. SR 266 was officially designated in 1968.

==Route description==
[[File:CA Route 266.JPG|200px|thumb|Southern terminus of SR 266 at the Nevada state line]]

State Route 266 begins at the western terminus of [[Nevada State Route 266]] at the Nevada state line. The route travels west-northwest, then turns to the west for another {{convert|1.8|mi|km|long=on}} before approaching [[Oasis, Mono County, California|Oasis]], the only unincorporated community that the route passes through. At Oasis, SR 266 intersects [[California State Route 168|SR 168]], which serves as the gateway into the [[Owens Valley]] from Nevada. Upon leaving Oasis, SR 266 continues to the west briefly, then turns north-northwest. Within the last {{convert|7|mi|km|long=on}}, SR 266 slowly curves northwest as the route approaches the Nevada state line. The route ends at the state line at the southern terminus of [[Nevada State Route 264]].<ref name="TCR"/>

The section of SR 266 from the western terminus to the junction with SR 68 is designated by the [[California State Legislature]] as eligible by law for the [[State Scenic Highway System (California)|State Scenic Highway System]];<ref name="scenic">{{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=shc&group=00001-01000&file=260-284|title=CA Codes (shc:260-284)|publisher= California State Legislature|accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref> however, it has not officially been designated by [[Caltrans]] as such.<ref name="caltransscenic">{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LandArch/scenic_highways/|title=Officially Designated State Scenic Highways and Historic Parkways|publisher= California Department of Transportation|accessdate=June 24, 2012|date=December 7, 2007}}</ref> The entire route, consisting of two lanes for two-way traffic, traverses on the flat land in the [[Fish Lake Valley]] east of the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]], and it can serve as transportation of agricultural goods between California and Nevada via the route's only junction [[California State Route 168|State Route 168]]. In the event that SR 168 is closed, SR 266 connects to [[Nevada State Route 264]], which intersects with [[U.S. Route 6]] in order to provide an alternate access to California.<ref name="TCR">{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist9/planning/docs/tcr_sr266.pdf|title=State Route 266 - Transportation Concept Report|date=June 2008|publisher=[[California Department of Transportation|Caltrans]]}}</ref>

==History==
The segment of present day SR 266 from Oasis to the Nevada state line (now [[Nevada State Route 264]]) was incorporated into the State Highway System in 1931 as Legislative Route 63;<ref name="CAstat1931">{{cite CAstat|year=1931|ch=82}}</ref> it had formed part of the [[Midland Trail]], one of the first [[auto trail]]s crossing the entire country.<ref name=fhwa>{{cite web|last=Westgard|first=A.L.|title=Motor Routes to the California Expositions|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/westgard.cfm|work=Highway History|publisher=Federal Highway Administration|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref>  The route remained unchanged until 1965, when in that year the route's name was designated as Mono County Road 101.<ref name="CAstat1965">{{cite CAstat|year=1965|ch=1875}}</ref> In 1984, the definition was modified to redesignate the segment as an extension of State Route 168 in order for that route to be connected to Nevada.<ref name="CAstat1984">{{cite CAstat|year=1984|ch=409}}</ref> Two years later, in 1986, there was a construction of a new segment traveling east from Oasis and connecting to [[Nevada State Route 266]].
