'''Pennsylvania Route&nbsp;654'''  (designated by the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]] as '''PA&nbsp;654''')  is an {{convert|11.7|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[state highway]] located in [[Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Lycoming County]] in [[Pennsylvania]]. It is known as West Southern Avenue and Riverside Drive in South Williamsport and Riverside Drive and Euclid Avenue in [[Duboistown, Pennsylvania|Duboistown]].  The western terminus is at [[Pennsylvania Route 44|Route&nbsp;44]] in [[Limestone Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Limestone Township]].  The eastern terminus is at [[U.S. Route 15 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route&nbsp;15]] in [[South Williamsport, Pennsylvania|South Williamsport]].

== Route description ==
Route&nbsp;654 begins at an intersection with [[Pennsylvania Route 44|Route&nbsp;44]] in [[Limestone Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Limestone Township]], just east of the hamlet of [[Oval, Pennsylvania|Oval]]. Route&nbsp;654 proceeds to the northeast through several farms and leaves Limestone for [[Bastress Township, Pennsylvania|Bastress Township]], and almost immediately enters the hamlet of Bastress. After the intersection with Jacks Hollow Road, the route curves from the northeast to the northwest before an elongated curve back to the northeast north of the hamlet. At the intersection with Dincher Lane, Route&nbsp;654 turns eastward, leaving the clearings for a dense woodland that contains another curve, this time to the north. After making this curve, the highway enters the hamlet of [[Nisbet, Pennsylvania|Nisbet]], in [[Susquehanna Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Susquehanna Township]]. Unlike the forests that precede it, Route&nbsp;654 through Nisbet is a stretch of residences on both sides of the highway. After making a curve to the east, the right-of-way merges with nearby East Village Drive, where the name of the road changes to Riverview Drive. At this point, Route&nbsp;654 parallels the [[West Branch of the Susquehanna River]] and nearby railroad tracks. After the merge, the route returns to its wooded setting for several miles along the West Branch.<ref name="bing">{{bing maps|url=http://binged.it/v2sBew|title=Overview map of Pennsylvania Route 654|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}</ref>

After entering [[Armstrong Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Armstrong Township]], Route&nbsp;654 forks to the southeast as Euclid Avenue, as the right-of-way continues as Cochran Avenue. Both roads enter the borough of [[Duboistown, Pennsylvania|Duboistown]]. Route&nbsp;654 crosses through downtown, passing businesses on the west side of town. At the intersection with Arch Street, Route&nbsp;654 is provided a connection to the city of [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]]. After the intersection with Arch Street, Euclid Street continues further into downtown Duboistown, crossing through the center of town before intersecting with Riverside Drive and entering the community of [[South Williamsport, Pennsylvania|South Williamsport]]. Paralleling [[U.S. Route 15 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route&nbsp;15]] on the opposite side of the river, the route soon intersects and merges with Southern Avenue, which becomes to the route moniker through downtown South Williamsport, passing local businesses. At the intersection with South Market Street, Route&nbsp;654 intersects with the southbound lanes of U.S. Route&nbsp;15, which had just crossed over the Susquehanna. However, Route&nbsp;654 continues for another block, terminating at an intersection with Hastings Street, which covers the northbound direction of U.S. Route&nbsp;15.<ref name="bing" />
