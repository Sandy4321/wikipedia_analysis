The '''''Gainesville Daily Register''''' is six-day [[daily newspaper]] published in [[Gainesville, Texas]], weekday (Monday through Friday) afternoons and Sunday mornings. The newspaper covers primarily [[Cooke County, Texas]], and parts of [[Love County, Oklahoma]] to the north, [[Montague County, Texas]] to the west, and [[Grayson County, Texas]] to the east. It is owned by [[Community Newspaper Holdings]] Inc (CNHI).

The newspaper, formerly known as '''''Gainesville Daily Register and Messenger''''', was a family-owned publication until it was acquired by Donrey Media sometime in the 1970s. In the 1990s CNHI acquired the newspaper. The publication continues to be printed on-site.
