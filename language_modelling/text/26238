"'''The Dog and Pony Show'''"{{#tag:ref|A "[[Dog and pony show]]" is a colloquial term which has come to mean a highly promoted, often over-staged performance, presentation, or event designed to sway or convince opinion for political, or less often, commercial ends.<ref>{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary: Eleventh Edition|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TAnheeIPcAEC&pg=PA369&dq=a+dog+and+pony+show+websters+dictionary&hl=en&sa=X&ei=jneGU8SMMbKh7Aaa0oGIAg&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=a%20dog%20and%20pony%20show%20websters%20dictionary&f=false|edition=11|year=2004|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|isbn=978-0-87779-809-5|page=369}}</ref>|group="note"}} is the eighth episode of the [[List of The Drew Carey Show episodes#Season 3 (1997<U+2013>98)|third season]] of the American sitcom ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', and the 54th overall. The series focuses on the work and home life of a fictionalized version of actor and comedian [[Drew Carey]]. The episode first aired on November 12, 1997 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the United States. The episode's plot sees [[Nigel Wick|Mr. Wick]] ([[Craig Ferguson]]) pass off caring for his boss [[List of The Drew Carey Show characters#Mrs. Lauder|Mrs. Lauder]]'s ([[Nan Martin]]) [[Hungarian Puli]] to his employee [[List of The Drew Carey Show characters#Drew Carey|Drew]] ([[Drew Carey]]). When Drew has the prize-winning dog shaved and neutered, he and his friends decide to perform a [[striptease]] at local bar, The Warsaw Tavern, to make money to buy a replacement.

The episode was co-written by producers [[Robert Borden (TV producer)|Robert Borden]] and Deborah Oppenheimer, while [[Steve Zuckerman]] directed. It was inspired by the British comedy film ''[[The Full Monty]]'' and Carey invited four of the film's cast members to appear in the episode. "The Dog and Pony Show" was shot on October 15, 1997 at the [[Warner Bros. Television]] studios in [[Burbank, California]]. The set was closed to the usual taping audience while the cast performed their striptease routine. "The Dog and Pony Show" was seen by an estimated 12.4 million viewing households, finishing in 15th place in the ratings for the week it aired. Critical response was mostly positive, with reporters praising the script and the striptease routine.

==Plot==
When [[Nigel Wick|Mr. Wick]] ([[Craig Ferguson]]) is asked to look after [[List of The Drew Carey Show characters#Mrs. Lauder|Mrs. Lauder]]'s ([[Nan Martin]]) prize-winning [[Hungarian Puli]], he decides to pass the task on to his employee [[List of The Drew Carey Show characters#Drew Carey|Drew]] ([[Drew Carey]]). [[Kate O'Brien]] ([[Christa Miller]]) offers to take the dog, Lucky, to Drew's house; but she has to leave suddenly to pick up her boyfriend [[Oswald Lee Harvey|Oswald]] ([[Diedrich Bader]]). Drew does not see Kate's note and assumes Lucky is a stray. He takes it to the vet to get it shaved and neutered. When Kate sees the dog, she fears that she, Drew and Mr. Wick will be fired. She finds an advertisement for a pure bred Hungarian Puli, but it costs $4,500. Since no one has that kind of money, Oswald suggests they sell their bodies for money. Inspired by ''[[The Full Monty]]'', the guys decide to perform a striptease at The Warsaw Tavern to make the money they need. [[Lewis Kiniski]] ([[Ryan Stiles]]) backs out of the performance at the last minute, but [[Larry Almada]] ([[Ian Gomez]]) steps in as his replacement. 

With the bar full, the guys begin their routine, but are soon stopped by the police, who explain that due to [[Zoning in the United States|zoning regulations]], stripping is illegal at The Warsaw. Drew and the guys go before the city council, but their request is denied. Drew questions how the council can deny something without seeing it and the guys, including Lewis, decide to demonstrate their striptease routine before the council members. Their request is then approved. After performing the striptease at the bar, Drew counts out the money and finds that they have $4,800. Mr. Wick asks what they should do with the extra money and Drew replies that they should give it to the people that earned it. He then walks over to the audience and hands out the extra money to the cast members of ''The Full Monty'', apologising for them having seen his naked buttocks.

The episode received mostly positive attention from television critics.

But the bun fun, half-baked as it is, is exuberant and preceded by smarter writing than usual."<ref name="Partial"/> The reporter called the characters "unlikely [[Chippendales]]" and added that Carey had one of the best scripts he had in a while, which mixed "understated humor with unself-conscious undress."<ref name="Partial"/> 

Alan Pergament, writing for ''[[The Buffalo News]]'', awarded the episode 3 and a half stars out of five and said the episode "offers a delicious take on the surprise theatrical movie hit from England."<ref name="Pergament">{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-22950332.html|title=Two shows reflect tragedy of JonBenet|last=Pergament|first=Alan|date=November 12, 1997|work=[[The Buffalo News]]|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Pergament thought there were too many penis jokes, especially for the show's time slot, but called the dance scenes "hysterically funny."<ref name="Pergament"/> ''[[The Spokesman-Review]]'s'' John Martin stated that while he usually condemned the "cheap, tawdry use of nudity" to boost ratings, it was different with Carey and he thought the take on ''The Full Monty'' was "riotous" and "wild".<ref name="Martin">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&dat=19971111&id=nvIzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=U_EDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3313,629652|title=Carey show takeoff on 'Full Monty'|last=Martin|first=John|date=November 11, 1997|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref> Martin finished by saying "Carey may be the only comic in prime time who could pull this off, so to speak.
