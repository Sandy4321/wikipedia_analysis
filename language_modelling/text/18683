"Chance Offered for Labor Law Reform." ''Eugene Register-Guard.'' December 30, 1969.</ref> In 1943, he joined the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of War]], where he served as Chief of the Domestic Labor Standards Section of the Industrial Personnel Division of the Army Service Forces.<ref name="Designation" /><ref name="Obit" /><ref name="Kilpatrick" /> He was appointedChief of the Industrial Relations Branch of the Office of the Judge Advocate General of the Army in 1945. <ref name="Designation" /><ref name="Obit" /><ref name="Kilpatrick" /> He was named special assistant to the Judge Advocate General of the Army for procurement in 1948; Director of the Office of Industrial Relations at the Department of Defense (DOD) in 1951; and Director of the DOD Office of Domestic Programs in 1955.<ref name="Designation" /><ref name="Obit" /><ref name="Kilpatrick" /><ref>"Wage Bill Opposed." ''New York Times.'' March 21, 1957.</ref>

On December 20, 1957, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight Eisenhower]] appointed Fanning as a Member of the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB).<ref name="Appointed" /><ref name="NLRB">[http://www.nlrb.gov/about_us/overview/board/board_members_since_1935.aspx "Board Members Since 1935." National Labor Relations Board. No date.] Accessed 2010-02-06.</ref> At the time he joined the NLRB, the Board and its regional directors were handling about 16,000 cases a year.<ref name="Shabecoff" /> In a testament to his professionalism and bipartisanship, he was reappointed by Presidents Eisenhower, [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], [[Richard Nixon]], and [[Jimmy Carter]].<ref name="Appointed" /><ref>[http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=4930 Gregory, David L. "The Demise of Workers' Rights."] [[America (magazine)|America]].'' August 28, 2006.</ref> He was widely known for being exceptionally knowledgeable about Board rulings,<ref name="Obit" /> but was also a frequent dissenter on the Board and known for being favorable to [[trade union|labor unions]].<ref>Grodin, Joseph. "The Kennedy Labor Board." ''Industrial Relations: A Journal of Economy and Society.'' 3:2 (May 2008).</ref> Fanning did not deny this bias, noting in 1977, "I'm convinced that if a company has a union in its plant, the union was pretty much invited in by the actions of the company. People don't pay union dues if they are entirely happy. Many employers are now recognizing that if you are not greedy, you can keep a union out of your plant if you really want to. All you have to do is pay the prevailing wages or a little more."<ref name="Shabecoff" /> His reappointment to the NLRB by President Nixon in 1972 for a fourth five-year term set a record at the time.<ref>"Notes on People." ''New York Times.'' November 4, 1977.</ref>

Fanning was appointed Chair of the NLRB by President Jimmy Carter in April 1977.<ref name="Appointed" /> At the time he was sworn in, he had participated in more than 20,000 decisions.<ref name="Shabecoff">Shabecoff, Philip. "The Proposed Changes in the Labor Law." ''New York Times.'' November 24, 1977.</ref> The Board's workload, however, had dropped to about just 1,000 cases a year.<ref name="Shabecoff" /> Under Fanning's leadership, the NLRB adopted a "vote and impound" procedure so that union organizing elections could be held as scheduled despite objections raised by unions or employers (a procedure which significantly sped up the election process).<ref>"N.L.R.B. Revises Its Procedures to Speed Up Bargaining Elections." ''Associated Press.'' August 16, 1977.</ref> He supported proposed labor law reforms in 1977, but did not think they would matter much in terms of union organizing. "Nothing that the Board does and nothing that is in the law starts or stops a tide of unionization in a particular industry. Organizing always seems to have a momentum of its own."<ref name="Shabecoff" /> He also instituted administrative reforms within the agency, establishing regional offices for the Board's extensive [[administrative law judge]] division rather than keeping them in Washington, D.C.<ref>"N.L.R.B. Opens Office In New York for Judges." ''New York Times.'' September 30, 1979.</ref>

William A. Lubbers served as Deputy Chief Counsel to the NLRB under Fanning.  When Lubbers was nominated in late 1979 to be the General Counsel, his nomination was [[filibuster]]ed by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|Senators]] who felt that he was too close to the pro-labor Fanning.<ref>Shabecoff, Philip. "Nominee Opposed by Businesses Gets Temporary Job at N.L.R.B." ''New York Times.'' December 28, 1979; Shabecoff, Philip. "Conservatives Filibuster to Prevent Carter Nomination to Labor Board." ''New York Times.'' April 17, 1980.</ref>

Fanning stepped down as NLRB Chairman on August 14, 1981.<ref name="NLRB" /> He retired from the NLRB on December 16, 1982.<ref name="NLRB" /> During his 25 years with the labor board, he took part in more than 25,000 decisions.<ref name="Obit" />

==Retirement and death==
After his retirement from the NLRB, Fanning lived in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. He joined the [[Providence, Rhode Island]], law firm of Hinckley, Allen, Snyder & Comen, and worked part-time as counsel to the [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers]].<ref name="Obit" /> He also was appointed a member of the [[Foreign Service Labor Relations Board]].<ref name="Obit" /> The year he retired, however, his wife of 40 years, Eloise Cooney Fanning, died.<ref name="Obit" />

Fanning established the John H. Fanning Chair in Labor Relations at the CUA Columbus School of Law, the John H. Fanning Conference on Labor-Management Relations at Providence College, and the John H. and Eloise M. Fanning Memorial Scholarship at Providence College.<ref name="Obit" /><ref>[http://www.providence.edu/Admission/Undergraduate+Financial+Aid/Grants+and+Scholarships/Institutional+Donor+Endowed.htm "Institutional Donor Endowed Grants and Scholarships."
