''All Hope Is Gone'' is also the band's first studio album on a [[Record label#Major labels (music groups)|major label]] to be recorded in their home state of [[Iowa]].

==Recording and production==
After a negative experience with [[Record producer|producer]] [[Rick Rubin]] on 2004's ''Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)'',<ref name="ArtisanInterview">{{cite news| title=Slipknot loved record, not Rick Rubin| url=http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=pULuIhbzUzc|date=2007-05-03| accessdate=2007-11-29|publisher = YouTube}}</ref> the band announced that their fourth studio album would be produced by Dave Fortman who also worked with Mudvayne and Evanescence.<ref name="BMProducer"/><ref name="K!Jan08"/> Preparation of the album began in February 2008, at the [[Sound Farm Studio & Recording Environment|Sound Farm Studio]] in Iowa. Unlike past releases, all of the members were on time every day and became involved in the writing process. The band wrote over thirty songs for the album.<ref name="RevAugust">{{cite journal | last = Epstein| first = Dan| authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2008| month = August| title = Wait and Bleed| journal = [[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]| volume = | issue = | pages = 54-6| id = | url = | accessdate = 2008-06-14| quote = }}</ref> 

When questioned about the production of the album, vocalist Taylor explained that the cycle was not met without conflict. He went on to add that every Slipknot album has been met with conflict and that they embrace this as they realize it is what brings out their creativity.<ref name="CoreyInterview"/> However, he also enjoyed the writing process explaining that all band members were getting involved, adding that it was the first time he had ever brought in a whole track in, that track being "Snuff".<ref name="CoreyInterview"/>

==Musical and lyrical themes==
[[Image:All hope is gone.jpg<U+200E>|thumb|left|Album teaser uploaded on the band's MySpace profile.]]
For ''All Hope Is Gone'', the band has displayed interest in making it their heaviest album to date. The band made an expansion on the [[thrash metal]] riffing that was displayed on ''Vol. 3'', as well as more guitar solos. However, they also want to make it their most experimental record, and will be including more acoustic guitars and melodic vocals. During an interview in the February 2008 edition of ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'', percussionist Crahan expressed a willingness for him and fellow percussionist [[Chris Fehn]] to experiment with hi-hats and cymbals which has been absent in the additional percussion in any previous work.<ref name="RevFeb08">{{cite news |title = Slipknot's Clown Talks About Upcoming Album |publisher = Blabbermouth |date = 2008-01-09 |url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=88079 |accessdate = 2008-01-10}}</ref> In an interview on [[May 13]], singer Corey Taylor described ''All Hope Is Gone'' as a "dark cross" between the band's two most recent studio albums, ''Iowa'' and ''Vol. 3''.

Taylor, whose lyrics have traditionally been about his life, stated this album's lyrics will be less about his life and more, "bitching about what's wrong in life".<ref name="RipFace"/> Crahan said that the album is different than their first three because its "done by a bunch of crazy guys in their 30s. That doesn't mean we're slowing down or not as intense <U+2014> our brains are different, so we're bringing different emotions, different feelings and different anxieties to the table now. This record is another diagnosis of our insanity."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1588339/20080529/slipknot.jhtml|title= Slipknot's Clown Tells Rockstar Tourmates 'Get Out Of Our Way'|accessdate=2008-05-30 |author= Chris Harris|date= 2008-05-30|work= |publisher=MTV.com}}</ref> Taylor would later say of the album, "I think it's the best thing I've ever made."<ref>{{cite news |title = Slipknot Percussionist Talks About New Single 'Psychosocial' |publisher = Blabbermouth.net |date = 2008-06-19 |url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=99384 |accessdate = 2008-06-20}}</ref> During an interview in June 2008 Taylor explained that the album title was aimed at the fans expectations of the band, stating; "All hope of trying to figure us out is completely obliterated."<ref name="CoreyInterview">{{cite web |title = Exclusive Podcast: Slipknot<U+2019>s Corey Taylor Raises the Flag Before Setting it Aflame |publisher = ''MTV'' |date = 2008-07-04 |url = http://headbangersblog.mtv.com/2008/07/04/exclusive-podcast-slipknots-corey-taylor-raises-the-flag-before-setting-it-aflame-addresses-mayhem-fest-new-record/ |accessdate = 2008-07-07}}</ref> When questioned about the musical outlook of the album Taylor explained that the band has retained some of the melodic elements that they experimented with on ''Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)'' but implies that this album is much darker and edgier.<ref name="CoreyInterview"/>

It rumored that, due to the members being unmasked in their side projects, Slipknot was going to be recording and touring this album unmasked. However, these rumors have been dismissed by many band members. Percussionist Shawn Crahan addressed this issue during an interview on [[The Sauce (Fuse TV Series)|The Sauce]] when discussing the release of their 2006 DVD release ''[[Voliminal: Inside the Nine]]''.<ref name="TheSauce">{{cite episode| title = Shawn Crahan Interview| series = The Sauce| serieslink = The Sauce (Fuse TV Series)| airdate = 2007-04-23}}</ref> Bassist [[Paul Gray (Slipknot)|Paul Gray]] confirmed during an interview that the band will be returning with a new image; regarding the masks, he stated, "It'll still be Slipknot, but we're gonna upgrade, step things up a little."<ref name="K!Jan08">{{cite news |title = What time is it?

==Reception==
Anticipation for the band's fourth studio album began upon the release of Slipknot's previous album, ''Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)'', when [[Allmusic]] stated, "there's a sense that whatever Slipknot do next might be their ultimate broadcast to the faithful."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:dnfuxqtaldfe~T1|title= Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses - Review|accessdate=2008-06-15 |author= Johnny Loftus|date= |work= |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> In a preview for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Chris Steffen wrote that the "the band<U+2019>s multiple percussionists generate a din that<U+2019>s more suffocating than ever" on the track <U+201C>Gematria<U+201D>. He went on to call <U+201C>Snuff<U+201D> the "most melodic" song, comparing it to ''Vol. 3''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s "Circle". The album's second single, "Psychosocial", "is capped off with a time-signature shattering guitar/drum breakdown that will leave the best air-instrumentalists stumped."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/06/20/new-slipknot-album-a-first-listen-to-all-hope-is-gone/|title= New Slipknot Album: A First Listen to <U+201C>All Hope Is Gone<U+201D>|accessdate=2008-06-23 |author= Chris Steffen|date= 2008-06-08|work= |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref>
