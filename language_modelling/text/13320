The '''Athenaeum''' originated as a [[gentlemen's club]] in [[Liverpool]], England.  It has been in continuous use since the end of the 18th&nbsp;century.  The club was founded to ensure the up-to-date provision of newspapers and pamphlets, and to create a library for the use of the merchants and professional men in the city.  The original building was demolished, and replaced by a new building nearby, in 1924.  The members of the club are known as Proprietors, and they include both men and women.  The building contains a large library, and it is also used by the Proprietors for social functions.  It can be hired for use by outside individuals and organisations.

==History==

The club was founded on 22 November 1797.  Towards this date, Liverpool had been growing rapidly as a commercial centre.  The merchants and other professionals in the city needed a supply of up-to-date news. This was usually provided by newspapers and periodicals in coffee houses, but these were frequently overcrowded.  There was also a need for a library because the existing library, founded in 1758, was not considered to be adequate.  The founders of the club produced a prospectus entitled ''Outlines of a Plan for a Library and Newsroom'', which proposed "to procure a regular supply of newspapers, both town and country, all the periodical publications of any value, and all the pamphlets that have reference to subjects of local or general polity or commerce".<ref name=ath>{{Citation | url = http://www.theathenaeum.org.uk/| title = The Athenaeum| accessdate = 15&nbsp;August 2011| publisher = The Athenaeum, Liverpool}}</ref>  They commissioned the local architect [[John Foster (architect)|John Foster]] to design a building for them in Church Street.<ref name=pev>{{Citation | last =Pollard| first =Richard | authorlink = | last2 = Pevsner | first2 = Nikolaus | author2-link =Nikolaus Pevsner| series= The Buildings of England|title =Lancashire: Liverpool and the South-West |edition= | publisher =[[Yale University Press]] | year =2006 | location =New Haven and London | page = 313| url = | doi = | id = | isbn =0-300-10910-5 }}</ref>  This opened on 1&nbsp;January 1799, and its library opened on 1&nbsp;May 1800.<ref name=ath/> The early members of the club included "entrepreneurs, slavery-abolitionists, free-thinkers, and political radicals, who regarded themselves as the commercial and intellectual champions of Liverpool".<ref name=pye>{{Citation | last = Pye| first = Ken| author-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 2011| title = Discover Liverpool| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = Liverpool| place = | publisher = Trinity Mirror Media| pages = | page = 70| format = | id = | isbn = 978-1-906802-90-5| doi = | oclc = | url = | accessdate =}}</ref> 

At this time there were gentlemen's clubs in London, but these were more policial in nature, or were institutions for gambling.<ref name=ath/>  The opening of the Liverpool Athenaeum preceded the [[Athenaeum Club, London|club of the same name]] in London by 27&nbsp;years.<ref name=ath/><ref name=pye/>  The members of the Liverpool club arranged for express riders, messengers, and the regular coaches serving the city, to bring them all the latest news, information, and ideas.  In addition to books, the library gathered a collection that included navigation charts, maps and globes.  It also obtained items from the private library of one of its founder members, [[William Roscoe]].  In time the library grew into "one of the world's most highly regarded private literary collections".<ref name=pye/>  

The members are known as Proprietors.<ref name=ath/>  Notable Proprietors have included, in addition to William Roscoe; [[William Henry Duncan|William Duncan]], the first [[Medical Officer for Health]] in Britain, [[Ronald Ross|Sir&nbsp;Ronald Ross]], winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1902, [[Charles Scott Sherrington|Sir&nbsp;Charles Sherrington]], joint winner of the same award in 1932, the local architect [[James Picton|Sir&nbsp;James Picton]], and the [[Francis Chavasse|Rt&nbsp;Revd&nbsp;Francis Chavasse]], the second [[Bishop of Liverpool]].<ref name=ath/><ref name=pye/>  In the 1920s, the Corporation of Liverpool decided to widen Church Street to accommodate a new tram system, and this involved the demolition of the club's building.<ref name=pye/>  A new building for the club, designed by Harold Dod, was constructed in Church Alley, between Church Street and School Lane, and was opened in 1924.<ref name=pev/>

==Architecture and contents==

The club occupies three storeys above a row of shops in Church Alley.  Its architectural style is described as "Chaste American classicism, with a strong French accent".<ref name=pev/>  The ground floor entrance has a [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] depicting the head of the Greek goddess [[Athena]].  Inside the entrance, an elliptical staircase leads up to the club's premises.<ref name=pev/>  The largest rooms are the Newsroom, the Dining Room, and the Library, and in addition there are smaller meeting rooms.<ref name=ath/>  The Library is on the second floor, and is decorated in [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] style.  It has a shallow segmental vaulted ceiling, and contains three [[bay (architecture)|bays]] that are separated by pairs of columns.  In the Library are three large paintings by Edward Halliday depicting events in [[Greek mythology]] involving Athena.<ref name=pev/> 

==Present day==

The Athenaeum continues to function as a club, and its Proprietors include men and women.  The membership is limited to 500&nbsp;people.  There is a grade of associate membership for certain categories of people, including retired people aged over 60, and those living more than 25&nbsp;miles from the club.  New Proprietors have to be proposed and seconded by existing Proprietors before they are admitted.  The Library contains over 60,000&nbsp;items, which include books, maps and charts, drawings of Liverpool buildings in the 19th&nbsp;century, and pencil sketches of former Liverpool personalities.  The club is open for the use of Proprietors each weekday.  A social programme is arranged, including dinners and other meals with speakers.  There are special interest groups for history, literature, music, and for wine tasting.  The building may be hired for use by Proprietors, or by outside individuals and groups.  Both the Library and the Newsroom are licensed for [[Civil ceremony|civil ceremonies]].<ref name=ath/>
