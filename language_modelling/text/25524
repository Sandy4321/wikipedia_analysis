The '''Royal Philharmonic Orchestra''' ('''RPO''') is an orchestra based in London. It was formed in 1946 by [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]]. In its early days the orchestra secured profitable recording contracts and important engagements including the [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]] and the concerts of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]]. After Beecham's death in 1961 the orchestra's fortunes declined steeply; it battled for survival until the mid-1960s, when its future was secured after an [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] report recommended that it should receive public subsidy. A further crisis arose when it seemed the orchestra's right to call itself "Royal" would be withdrawn.

Since Beecham's death the RPO has had seven chief conductors including [[Rudolf Kempe]], [[Antal Dor<U+00E1>ti]], [[Andr<U+00E9> Previn]] and [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]]. At 2013 the incumbent was [[Charles Dutoit]]. Others closely associated with the orchestra have included [[Charles Groves|Sir Charles Groves]], [[Charles Mackerras|Sir Charles Mackerras]], [[Peter Maxwell Davies]], [[Yehudi Menuhin]] and [[Leopold Stokowski]]. 

In 2004 the orchestra acquired its first permanent London base, at the new [[Cadogan Hall]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]. The RPO also gives concerts at the [[Royal Festival Hall]], the [[Royal Albert Hall]] and venues around the UK and other countries. From its earliest days the orchestra has been active in the recording studios, making film soundtracks and numerous gramophone recordings; many of the LP recordings conducted by Beecham and others have been reissued on compact disc.

==History==
===Origins===
[[File:RPO-arms.jpg|thumb|Arms of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]
In 1932 the conductor [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]] had founded the the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] (LPO), which, with the backing of rich supporters, he ran until 1940, when finances dried up in wartime. Beecham left to conduct in Australia and then the US. The orchestra reorganised itself as a self-governing body and continued without him. On his return to England in September 1944 the LPO welcomed him back, and in October they gave a concert together which drew superlatives from the critics.<ref>[[William Glock|Glock, William]], "Music", ''[[The Observer]]'' 8 October 1944, p. 2; and "Sir T. Beecham's Return", ''The Times'', 9 October 1944, p. 8</ref> Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, declined to give him the unfettered control that he had exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again it would be as a paid employee of the orchestra.<ref>Reid (1961), p. 230</ref> Beecham responded, "I emphatically refuse to be wagged by any orchestra ... I am going to found one more great orchestra to round off my career."<ref name=reid231>Reid (1961), p. 231</ref> In 1945 he conducted the first concert of [[Walter Legge]]'s new [[Philharmonia Orchestra]] but was not disposed to accept a salaried position from Legge, his former assistant, any more than from his former players in the LPO.<ref name=reid231/>{{#tag:ref|Of the 75 players who constituted the LPO in 1944 only 18 had been in the LPO that Beecham left in 1940.<ref>Lucas, p.306</ref>|group= n}} His new orchestra to rival the Philharmonia would, he told Legge, be launched in "the most auspicious circumstances and ''<U+00E9>clat''".<ref>Osborne, p. 248</ref>

In 1946 Beecham reached an agreement with the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]]: his new orchestra would replace the LPO at all the Society's concerts.<ref name=reid231/> He thus gained the right to name the new ensemble the "Royal Philharmonic Orchestra", an arrangement approved by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]].<ref>"Orchestra Refuse to Drop 'Royal' from Title, '' The Times'', 19 August 1964, p. 10</ref>{{#tag:ref|The Society had its own orchestra from its foundation in 1813 until 1932, when it agreed with Beecham that the new LPO would play at all its concerts.<ref>Three Orchestras", ''The Times'' 24 September 1932, p. 8; and "The Royal Philharmonic", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 21 August 1946, p. 3</ref> The new Royal Philharmonic Orchestra was granted the right to use the name when playing for the Society or at any other performance conducted by or under the artistic control of Beecham.<ref>[[George Baker (record singer)|Baker, George]]. "Royal Philharmonic Orchestra", ''The Times'', 4 July 1964, p. 9</ref>|group= n}} Beecham arranged with the [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne Festival]] that the RPO should be the resident orchestra at Glyndebourne seasons. He secured backing, including that of record companies in the US as well as Britain, with whom lucrative recording contracts were negotiated.<ref name=reid231/> The music critic Lyndon Jenkins writes:

{{quote|Naturally, it quickly became known that he was planning another orchestra, at which the cry "He'll never get the players!" went up just as it had done in 1932. Beecham was unmoved: "I always get the players," he retorted. "Among other considerations, they are so good they refuse to play under anybody but me ..."<ref>Jenkins (2005), p. 99</ref>|}} 

===Beecham years===
Beecham appointed [[Victor Olof]] as his orchestral manager, and they started recruiting. At the top of their list were leading musicians with whom Beecham had worked before the war. Four had been founder-members of the LPO fifteen years previously: [[Reginald Kell]] (clarinet), [[Gerald Jackson]] (flute), James Bradshaw (timpani) and Jack Silvester (double-bass). From the current LPO they engaged the oboist Peter Newbury. Beecham persuaded the veteran bassoonist [[Archie Camden]], who had been pursuing a solo career, to return to orchestral work. The cellos were led by Raymond Clark, enlisted from the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]]. The principal horn player was [[Dennis Brain]], who already held the same post in Legge's Philharmonia, but managed to play for both orchestras.<ref name=j99/> Jenkins speculates that as Beecham knew all Britain's orchestral [[Concertmaster|leaders]] at first hand he decided not to try to lure any of them away. His choice was John Pennington, who had been first violin of the [[London String Quartet]] from 1927 to 1934, and had then had a career in the US as concertmaster, successively, of the [[San Francisco Symphony]], [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] orchestras.<ref name=j99>Jenkins (2005), pp. 99<U+2013>100</ref><ref>Lucas, p. 317</ref>

On 11 September 1946 the Royal Philharmonic assembled for its first rehearsal.<ref name=j99/> Four days later it gave its first concert, at the Davis Theatre, [[Croydon]].<ref>"Sir Thomas Beecham's New Orchestra", ''The Times'', 12 September 1946, p. 6</ref> Beecham telegraphed a colleague, "Press virtually unanimous in praise of orchestra. First Croydon concert huge success".<ref>Cardus et al, p 4</ref> Beecham and the orchestra played a series of out-of-town engagements before venturing a first London concert on 26 October. ''[[The Times]]'' then spoke of "a hall filled with golden tone which enveloped the listener".<ref>"Delius Festival", ''The Times'', 28 October 1946, p. 6</ref> Before its London debut the orchestra made its first recording, and within two years had made more than 100.<ref name=potts8/>

Within a few months Pennington was forced to resign when the British [[Musicians' Union (UK)| Musicians' Union]] discovered that he was not one of its members.<ref>Lucas, p. 319</ref>{{#tag:ref|At the time, union membership was compulsory for players in British orchestras.<ref>Orchestral Politics", ''The Times'', 26 August 1949, p. 8</ref>|group= n}} He was succeeded by his deputy Oscar Lampe, "a man who eschewed most social graces but played the violin divinely", according to Jenkins.<ref>Jenkins (2005), p. 100</ref> In the early days the orchestra comprised 72 players all on yearly contract to Beecham, giving him first call on their services, subject to reasonable notice, but not otherwise restricting their freedom to play for other ensembles.<ref name=potts8>Potts, p. 8</ref> A review of the London orchestral scene of the late 1940s said of the RPO and its main rival: "The Philharmonia and Royal Philharmonic share a very serious disability: that neither is a permanently constituted orchestra. Both assemble and disperse more or less at random <U+2026> there is no style which is distinctively RPO or Philharmonia."<ref>Hill, p. 214</ref>  

Brain continued to play first horn for both orchestras; otherwise, from the early 1950s, there was generally more stability of orchestral personnel. In particular the RPO became celebrated for its regular team of woodwind principals, in which Jackson was joined by [[Jack Brymer]] (clarinet), [[Gwydion Brooke]] (bassoon) and [[Terence MacDonagh]] (oboe).<ref>Jenkins (2000), p. 5</ref> ''[[The Independent]]'' described them as "arguably the finest ever wind section ... [they] became known as 'The Royal Family'."<ref>Melville-Mason, Graham. [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/gwydion-brooke-6148964.html "Gwydion Brooke <U+2013> Bassoonist in Sir Thomas Beecham's 'Royal Family'"], ''The Independent'', 5 April 2005</ref>{{#tag:ref|Jackson left the orchestra in 1958, and was succeeded by [[Geoffrey Gilbert]], whom ''The Times'' called "the most influential British flautist of the twentieth century". The quartet of woodwind soloists continued to be generally known as "the Royal Family"<ref>"Geoffrey Gilbert", ''The Times'', 22 May 1989, p. 20</ref>|group= n}}

The RPO toured the United States in 1950, the first British orchestra to visit America since the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] (LSO) in 1912. This was a long-cherished plan of Beecham's, who had been unable to take the LPO to the US in the 1930s. He arranged 52 concerts in 45 cities in 64 days. The tour was described by Brain's biographers Gamble and Lynch as a huge success.<ref name=gamble/> It began on 13 October in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and finished on 15 December in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]]. The concerto soloists were the pianist [[Betty Humby Beecham]] (the conductor's second wife) and orchestral principals: [[David McCallum, Sr.|David McCallum]] (violin), [[Anthony Pini]] (cello), and the four members of the "Royal Family".<ref name=gamble>Gamble and Lynch, p. 60</ref> In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Olin Downes]] wrote of "magnificent music-making by Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic".<ref>Downes, Olin. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B12F9395914728FDDAD0994DA415B8089F1D3 "Beecham Superb in Concert Here; Conducts Royal Philharmonic in Stirring Concert"], ''The New York Times'', 14 December 1950, p. 50 {{subscription}}</ref> The following year, assessing all the London orchestras, Frank Howes, music critic of ''The Times'', concluded that the RPO "comes nearest in quality and in consistency of style to the great international orchestras".<ref>Howes, Frank. "London Orchestras", ''The Times'', 8 June 1951, p. 6</ref>

The orchestra's first appearance at the [[the Proms|Proms]] took place in August 1952, conducted by [[Basil Cameron]].<ref>Cardus et al, p. 4</ref> Beecham made his Proms debut two years later, conducting the RPO in a programme of music by [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]]. ''The Times'' commented on "an evening of magnificent playing".<ref>"Promenade Concert <U+2013> Sir Thomas Beecham's D<U+00E9>but", ''The Times'', 6 September 1954, p. 9</ref> In 1957 Beecham and the RPO made a European tour, beginning at the [[Salle Pleyel]] in Paris and ending at the [[Musikverein]] in Vienna.<ref>Lucas, pp. 331<U+2013>332</ref> 

Beecham conducted the RPO in his last concert, given at [[Portsmouth Guildhall]] on 7 May 1960. The programme, all characteristic choices, comprised the ''[[Magic Flute]]'' Overture, Haydn's [[Symphony No. 100 (Haydn)|''Military'' Symphony]], Beecham's own [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] arrangement ''Love in Bath'', Schubert's [[Symphony No. 5 (Schubert)|Fifth Symphony]], ''On the River'' by [[Frederick Delius|Delius]], and the ''Bacchanale'' from [[Camille Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns|Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns]]'s ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson and Delilah]]'', with Delius's ''Sleigh Ride'' as an encore.<ref>Lucas, p. 338</ref> Beecham suffered a heart attack the following month, from which he did not recover; he died in March 1961.<ref>Lucas, p. 339</ref>

Kempe resigned, though he returned shortly afterwards. Helped by strong support from [[Malcolm Sargent|Sir Malcolm Sargent]], the orchestra successfully mounted its own concerts at a cinema in [[Swiss Cottage]], 3<U+00BD> miles to the north-west of the Festival Hall.<ref>Reid (1968), pp. 429<U+2013>434</ref> A 1965 report to the [[Arts Council]] by a committee chaired by [[Alan T. Peacock|Alan Peacock]] recommended that all four independent London orchestras should receive adequate public subsidy.<ref name=c6>Cardus et al, p. 6</ref> 

The severance of the tie with the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1963 turned out to be temporary,{{#tag:ref|The RPS resumed its association with the orchestra from the 1966<U+2013>67 season.<ref>Potts, p. 11</ref>|group= n}}  but for three years it threatened to deprive the RPO of the "Royal" in its title. The matter was resolved in 1966, when on the advice of [[Roy Jenkins]], who as [[Home Secretary]] had responsibility for such matters, [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] conferred the title unconditionally on the orchestra.<ref>"Orchestra Wins Royal Fight", ''The Times'', 16 July 1966, p. 12</ref> 
[[File:Clifford-Curzon.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Clifford Curzon]], soloist at the RPO's Silver Jubilee concert]]
The RPO celebrated its [[silver jubilee]] in 1971. On 15 September the orchestra returned to Croydon, where it had made its debut 25 years earlier. The theatre where it had first played had been demolished, and the anniversary concert was given at the [[Fairfield Halls]]. The programme consisted of the overture to ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|''Emperor'']] Concerto, and [[Gustav Holst|Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]''. [[Adrian Boult|Sir Adrian Boult]] conducted, and [[Clifford Curzon]] was the soloist.<ref>Cardus et al, pp. 12<U+2013>13</ref> Five members of the original orchestra were still in the RPO for the jubilee concert: Leonard Brain (brother of Dennis), principal cor anglais; Lewis Pocock, co-principal timpani; Ernest Ineson, double bass; John Myers, viola; and Albert Pievsky, violin.<ref name=c6/>

The RPO gave Kempe the title of "Conductor for Life" in 1970; he stepped down from the orchestra in 1975, the year before his death. He was succeeded as chief conductor by [[Antal Dor<U+00E1>ti]], who held the post from 1975 to 1978; as in his earlier spells with the LSO and BBC Symphony Orchestra, he was not greatly liked by his players, but raised their standard of playing and imposed discipline.<ref>"Great Orchestra's Predicament", ''The Times'', 28 June 1963, p. 18; and "Antal Dorati", ''The Times'', 16 November 1988, p. 18</ref>

In 1984 there was a new threat to the orchestra: a review carried out on behalf of the Arts Council by the journalist [[William Rees-Mogg]] opined that England lacked "a great eastern symphony orchestra": the suggestion was that the RPO should move to [[Nottingham]]. Another Arts Council report of the same period recommended that the RPO should supplement the LSO as resident orchestra at the [[Barbican Centre]]; neither proposal came to fruition.<ref>Morrison, p 152</ref> During the 1980s the British government imposed strict constraints on public spending; to make up for lost revenue, the RPO, in common with the other self-governing London orchestras, was forced into increased reliance on business sponsorship as a primary source of funds. The ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', recording this, comments, "Such sponsorship is, however, subject to changing circumstances and thus less secure in the long term."<ref>Temperley, Nicholas, et al.

Since 1993 the RPO has had a community and education programme, later given the title of "RPO Resound". It aims to increase "access to and engagement with world-class music-making."<ref name=about/> It has worked in venues including homeless shelters, hospices, youth clubs and prisons.<ref name=about>[http://www.rpo.co.uk/history.php "About the orchestra"], Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, accessed 4 June 2013</ref>
