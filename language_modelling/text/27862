'''Benjamin Ogle Tayloe''' (May 21, 1796 <U+2014> February 25, 1868) was an [[United States|American]] [[Businessperson|businessman]], [[bon vivant]], [[diplomat]], and influential political activist in [[Washington, D.C.]], in the first half of the [[19th century]]. Although he never held elective office, he was a prominent [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] and influential in presidential electoral politics in the 1840s and 1850s.<ref name="Watson78">Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 78.</ref> His home, the [[Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House|Tayloe House]], became a [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] for politically powerful people in the federal government and socially influential individuals in the United States and abroad. Tayloe was also a party in the important 1869 [[contract]] law case, ''[[Willard v. Tayloe]]'', 75 U.S. 557.

From 1815 to 1817, Tayloe studied law under [[United States Attorney General]] [[Richard Rush]].<ref name="Watson6">Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 6.</ref> When Rush was appointed [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Minister to Great Britain]] in 1817, Tayloe was named his Private Secretary.<ref name="Watson6" /> While in [[London]], he lived at 15 King Street, [[Portman Square]].<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 7.</ref> He visited often with many of Great Britain's most influential politicians and noblity, and became close friends with the young [[Painting|painter]] [[Washington Allston]] and the [[author]] [[Washington Irving]].<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 7-8.</ref> He was presented to the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent, George]], in 1818.<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 9-10.</ref> He also traveled widely in [[Europe]], [[Ireland]], and [[Scotland]],<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 8-12.</ref> and was an observer at the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1818.<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 12-13.</ref> He traveled to Paris in the spring of 1819, where [[United States Ambassador to France|Minister to France]] [[Albert Gallatin]] introduced him to [[Louis XVIII of France|King Louis XVIII]] and [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P<U+00E9>rigord|Talleyrand]].<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 15.</ref>

Tayloe returned to the United States in November 1819 and settled at Windsor (his inherited family estate in [[King George County, Virginia]]), where he began writing for various [[horse racing]] and [[horse breeding]] publications.<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 17, 20.</ref><ref>Belair Mansion, his maternal grandfather's residence, had been home to some of the earliest horse racing and horse breeding in the United States, and would continue to be so for three centuries. See: Fiehler and Baltz, "National Register of Historic Places Inventory <U+2013> Nomination Form: Belair Mansion," 1976.</ref>

Tayloe's father, Col. John Tayloe III, died on March 23, 1828.<ref>Hardy, ''Colonial Families of the Southern States of America,'' 1911, p. 502.</ref> Col. Tayloe had built six two-[[storey|story]] houses facing [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] at 14th Street NW in 1816, and in 1817 had leased them to John Tennison who ran them as a hotel.<ref>Moeller and Weeks, ''AIA Guide to the Architecture of Washington, D.C.,'' 2006, p. 133.</ref><ref name="Hogarth">Hogarth, ''Walking Tours of Old Washington and Alexandria,'' 1985, p. 28.</ref> The structures served as a hotel for the next three decades, the leaseholder and name changing several times: Williamson's Mansion Hotel, Fullers American House, and the City Hotel.<ref name="Hogarth" />

Although Tayloe preferred to live at Windsor, his wife asked that they move into the city where she was more comfortable.<ref name="Watson23">Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 23.</ref>

==Later career==
===Residence in Washington, D.C.===
[[File:Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House - 1886.jpg|thumb|150px|The Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House in 1886.]]
In 1828, Tayloe built his wife a [[Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House|house]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], directly across the street from the [[White House]].<ref name="Carrier">Carrier, ''Washington D.C.: A Historical Walking Tour,'' 1999, p. 76.</ref><ref name="Evelyn166">Evelyn, Dickson, and Ackerman, ''On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington, D.C.,'' 2008, p. 166.</ref><ref name="Smith256">Smith, "Historic Washington Homes," ''Records of the Columbia Historical Society,'' 1908, p. 256.</ref> The Tayloes did not immediately occupy their home, however. Tayloe had a strong political disagreement with the newly-elected President, [[Andrew Jackson]], and refused to move into the home.<ref name="Watson23" /><ref name="Lockwood159">Lockwood, ''Historic Homes in Washington: Its Noted Men and Women,'' 1889, p. 159-160.</ref> Instead, Tayloe leased the building to Thomas Swann, Sr., a [[lawyer]] (and the father of [[Thomas Swann|Thomas Swann, Jr.]], who became [[Governor of Maryland]] in 1866).<ref name="Watson23" /><ref name="Lockwood159" /> Swann vacated the home in November 1829, at which time Tayloe and his wife made the house their permanent residence.<ref name="Watson23" />

The Tayloe House was an important social gathering place for important Washingtonians in the four decades following its construction.<ref name="Carrier" /><ref name="Lockwood160">Lockwood, ''Historic Homes in Washington: Its Noted Men and Women,'' 1889, p. 160.</ref><ref name="Bednar99">Bednar, ''L' Enfant's Legacy: Public Open Spaces in Washington, D.C.,'' 2006, p. 99.</ref><ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 23-24.</ref> In 1829, when [[Henry Clay]] left the office of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], much of the [[furniture]] in his home was acquired by the Tayloes and used to decorate their home.<ref>Lockwood, ''Historic Homes in Washington: Its Noted Men and Women,'' 1889, p. 156.</ref> Tayloe House was the last house in Washington which President [[William Henry Harrison]] visited before he died in 1841.<ref name="Carrier" /><ref name="Smith256" /><ref name="Lockwood160" /><ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 27.</ref><ref>At least one source claims that President Harrison contracted the illness which eventually killed him while walking through the [[slush]] to the Tayloe house in order to offer Tayloe's brother employment in the federal civil service. See: Bowers, ''The Party Battles of the Jackson Period,'' 1922, p. 14.</ref>

Tayloe House was the scene of a murder in 1859. [[Philip Barton Key II]] was the son of [[Francis Scott Key]] and the nephew of [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Roger B. Taney]].<ref>Walther, ''The Shattering of the Union: America in the 1850s,'' 2004, p. 163-164.</ref> In the spring of 1858, Key began having an affair with [[Teresa Bagioli Sickles]], the wife of his friend [[Daniel Sickles]].<ref>Gallagher, ''Three Days at Gettysburg: Essays on Confederate and Union Leadership,'' 1999, p. 133.</ref> On February 26, 1859, Sickles learned of the affair.<ref name="Walther164">Walther, ''The Shattering of the Union: America in the 1850s,'' 2004, p. 164.</ref> The following day, he saw Key in Lafayette Square signalling to his wife.<ref name="Walther164" /> Sickles rushed out into the park, drew a single pistol, and shot the unarmed Key three times while the other men pleaded for his life.<ref name="Walther164" /> Key was taken into the nearby Tayloe House and died moments later.<ref name="Smith256" /><ref name="Lockwood160" /> Key's spirit, eyewitnesses and authors claim, now haunts Lafayette Square and can be seen on dark nights near the spot where he was shot.<ref>Apkarian-Russell, ''Washington's Haunted Past: Capital Ghosts of America,'' 2006, p. 88; Cohen, ''Civil War Ghosts,'' 1999, p. 49.</ref>

The Tayloe house became a noted meeting place for many of the leading political figures of early 19th century American politics. Tayloe was one of the most influential and active members of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] in the District of Columbia.<ref name="Watson78" /> Among the many frequent visitors to the house were [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]], Senator and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Henry Clay]], Senator and Secretary of State [[Daniel Webster]], Vice President and Secretary of State [[John C. Calhoun]], Senator [[Henry Clay]], Senator and Secretary of State [[Lewis Cass]], Secretary of State [[Edward Livingston]], [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] and Senator [[Robert Charles Winthrop]], [[General officer|General]] [[Winfield Scott]], Senator and Secretary of State [[Edward Everett]], Senator and Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]], [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Joseph Story]], and many others.<ref name="Adams">Adams and Keene, ''Alice Paul and the American Suffrage Campaign,'' 2008, p. 109.</ref><ref name="Oppel">Oppel and Meisel, ''Washington, D.C.: A Turn-of-the-Century Treasury,'' 1987, p. 10.</ref><ref name="Latimer">Latimer, ''Your Washington and Mine,'' 1924, p. 198.</ref><ref name="Bowers14">Bowers, ''The Party Battles of the Jackson Period,'' 1922, p. 14.</ref><ref name="Watson176">Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 176.</ref> Presidents [[John Quincy Adams]], [[Martin Van Buren]], William Henry Harrison, [[Zachary Taylor]], and [[Millard Fillmore]] also were frequent quests.<ref name="Adams" /><ref name="Latimer" /><ref name="Bowers14" /><ref name="Watson176" /> [[Anthony Trollope]] spent much of his free time being entertained by the Tayloes at their home during his visit to Washington, D.C., in the winter of 1862.<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 78.</ref>

===Plantation activities===
[[File:Uncle Jim - Benjamin Ogle Tayloe slave - age 94 - 1915.jpg|thumb|150px|"Uncle" Jim Lawson, an African American born into slavery and owned by Benjamin Ogle Tayloe. He was moved from Maryland to the Windsor plantation in Alabama around 1845. This photo depicts him at age 94 in 1915, still working on the Tayloe estate.]]
Tayloe purchased a [[cotton]] [[plantation]] in northeast [[Marengo County, Alabama|Marengo]] (now [[Hale County, Alabama|Hale]]) and southwest [[Perry County, Alabama|Perry]] counties between [[Uniontown, Alabama|Uniontown]] and [[Selma, Alabama]], in 1836.<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 25-26.</ref> A [[Slavery|slave owner]], Tayloe gradually moved most of his slaves from Virginia to Alabama, and invested most of his [[Capital (economics)|capital]] in the plantation.<ref name="Watson26">Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 26.</ref> The Tayloes spent the following year traveling in Europe.<ref name="Watson26" /><ref name="BigHouse">Scarborough, ''Masters of the Big House: Elite Slaveholders of the Mid-Nineteenth-Century South,'' 2006, p. 131.</ref> The plantation was managed by Tayloe's younger brother, Henry A. Tayloe.<ref name="BigHouse" /> Henry Tayloe proved a less than capable manager, however, and was relieved of his position in 1843.<ref name="BigHouse" /> The Tayloe property flourished afterward, and by 1851 Benjamin and his other brother, William, owned seven plantations (which included more than {{convert|13,146|acre}} and 465 slaves worth $334,250 <nowiki>[</nowiki>about $13.6 million in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars<nowiki>]</nowiki>).<ref name="BigHouse" /> 

The Tayloes were the largest absentee landlords in Alabama.<ref name="Phactao">"Plantation Houses of the Alabama Canebrake and Their Associated Outbuildings, 181-1942," National Register of Historic Places, February 12, 1993, p. 17.</ref> Oversee Robert Morgan earned $1,200 annually for his duties on the Benjamin Ogle Tayloe plantation, 2.4 times what most overseers in the [[Canebrake (region of Alabama)|Canebreak Region of Alabama]] did.<ref name="Phactao" /> Tayloe visited his property in Alabama only twice during his lifetime.<ref>Sellers, ''Slavery in Alabama,'' 1950, p. 182.</ref><ref>At least one source says Tayloe only visited the region once in his lifetime. See: "Plantation Houses of the Alabama Canebrake and Their Associated Outbuildings, 181-1942," National Register of Historic Places, February 12, 1993, p. 17.</ref>

Tayloe's views on slavery were somewhat moderate in nature. He strongly (but privately) disapproved of sexually abusing slaves and [[miscegenation]].<ref>Scarborough, ''Masters of the Big House: Elite Slaveholders of the Mid-Nineteenth-Century South,'' 2006, p. 28.</ref> He felt it inappropriate to ask his daughters to inherit slaves (except for a few household slaves, if the girls wished it).<ref>Scarborough, ''Masters of the Big House: Elite Slaveholders of the Mid-Nineteenth-Century South,'' 2006, p. 100-101.</ref> Although Tayloe supported slavery as a legal institution, he did not feel the issue should bring about the dissolution of the Union. During the [[Compromise of 1850|slavery crisis of 1850]], Tayloe favored maintaining Union over maintaining slavery in the [[Deep South]]. He wrote at the time:
:[[South Carolina|S.C.]] is ripe for disunion. ... Her glory has departed<U+2014>& she knows it. That is the rub. But the Union ''must'' & will be preserved<U+2014>as I think. Still S.C. may annoy our sisterhood with her old maidish complaints & reproaches. She is proud & poor<U+2014>having been rich! Poor S.C.!<ref>Scarborough, ''Masters of the Big House: Elite Slaveholders of the Mid-Nineteenth-Century South,'' 2006, p. 238.</ref>
Nonetheless, he generally opposed freeing the slaves, and believed that slavery and union could co-exist if only partisan political feeling could be reduced.<ref>Scarborough, ''Masters of the Big House: Elite Slaveholders of the Mid-Nineteenth-Century South,'' 2006, p. 245-246, 264.</ref> When [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Preston Brooks]] of South Carolina beat Senator [[Charles Sumner]] with a cane (leaving him severely wounded) on the floor of the U.S. Senate in 1856, Tayloe applauded Brooks' actions and said Sumner "deserved a sound thrashing<U+2014>& got it!"<ref>Scarborough, ''Masters of the Big House: Elite Slaveholders of the Mid-Nineteenth-Century South,'' 2006, p. 279.</ref> When [[Fort Sumter]] was [[Battle of Fort Sumter|shelled by Confederate forces]] (opening the [[American Civil War]]), Tayloe believed that peace could still be restored.<ref>Scarborough, ''Masters of the Big House: Elite Slaveholders of the Mid-Nineteenth-Century South,'' 2006, p. 309.</ref>

A prominent Whig, Tayloe supported Henry Clay for President in 1840. When Clay did not win the nomination, Tayloe supported William Henry Harrison, and his efforts on Harrison's behalf led the new President to consider him a confidante.<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 25-27.</ref> Tayloe also played an important role in the unsuccessful [[United States presidential election, 1844|1844 candidacy]] of Henry Clay for President of the United States.<ref name="Watson29" /> He also made many friends among the diplomatic corps, among them the [[List of Belgian ambassadors to the United States|Belgian Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]] [[Comte]] [[Auguste Vanderstraeten-Ponthoz]], with whom he met in 1843 (the Comte departed in 1844) and kept up a 20-year correspondence.<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 58.</ref>

After a long illness, Julia Tayloe died on July 4, 1846.<ref name="Lockwood160" /><ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 30.</ref>

===Willard Hotel lawsuit===
[[File:Willard Hotel - Franklin Pierce inauguration - Illustrated News - 1853.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Engraving depicting the Willard Hotel in 1853.]]
Tayloe divested himself of his hotel business in 1847. He had renovated the "hotel" on Pennsylvania Avenue in 1843 and 1844.<ref name="Watson29">Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 29.</ref> But by 1847 the structures were in disrepair and Tayloe was desperate to find a tenant who would maintain them and run the enterprise profitably.<ref name="WillardKellog">Willard, "Henry Augustus Willard: His Life and Times," ''Records of the Columbia Historical Society,'' 1917, p. 244-245.</ref><ref name="Goode204">Goode, ''Capital Losses: A Cultural History of Washington's Destroyed Buildings,'' 2003, p. 204.</ref> A chance encounter led to the founding of one of the most legendary hotels in the city's history. Tayloe had become engaged to Phoebe Warren, another young woman from Troy, New York.<ref name="WillardKellog" /> Miss Warren was traveling on the Steamer Niagara (a ship which traveled up and down the [[Hudson River]]) when she met Henry Willard, a [[Chief Steward]] aboard the vessel.<ref name="WillardKellog" /><ref name="Goode204" /> Miss Warren was so impressed with the way Willard handled the ship's and passengers' needs that she recommended him to her fiance<U+00E9>.<ref name="WillardKellog" /> Willard visited Washington, D.C., in October 1847 to meet with Tayloe, who subsequently leased the six hotel buildings to him.<ref name="WillardKellog" /> Willard combined them into a single structure in 1850 and enlarged it into a four story-hotel he called the [[Willard InterContinental Washington|Willard Hotel]].<ref name="Goode204" /><ref name="Tindall">Tindall, ''Standard History of the City of Washington From a Study of the Original Sources,'' 1914, p. 353-354.</ref><ref name="WillardKellog" /><ref>Burlingame, ''With Lincoln in the White House,'' 2006, p. 197.</ref>

Tayloe's lease to Willard later generated an important case before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. In 1854, Tayloe leased the property again to Willard, this time for 10 years at a rate of $1,200 per year.<ref name="SupremeCourt">''Willard v. Tayloe,'' 75 U.S. 557.</ref> The lease contained a provision that Willard could purchase the entire property at any time during the life of the lease for $22,500<U+2014>$2,000 in "cash" down payment and another $2,000 a year plus interest thereafter until the mortgage was paid.<ref name="SupremeCourt" /><ref name="Goode205">Goode, ''Capital Losses: A Cultural History of Washington's Destroyed Buildings,'' 2003, p. 205.</ref> During the lease, the Civil War broke out and property values in Washington, D.C., skyrocketed.<ref name="SupremeCourt" />  In 1863, Congress passed the [[National Banking Act]], which authorized the federal government to issue [[United States Note]]s (paper money) rather than certificates redeemable in gold. On April 15, 1864, two weeks before the lease was due to expire, Willard tendered the down payment to Tayloe in paper money.<ref name="SupremeCourt" /> Tayloe refused to issue the mortgage and turn over the deed, claiming that the hotel was now worth much more than $22,500 and that Willard had not paid in gold (the only form of cash available in 1854) as specified in the lease.<ref name="SupremeCourt" /><ref name="Goode205" /> Willard sued. The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia held against Willard.<ref name="SupremeCourt" />  Willard appealed.  In 1869, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the terms of the lease should not be interpreted as of the date it was agreed to (1854).<ref name="SupremeCourt" /><ref name="Goode205" /> Congress had made the use of gold and silver as currency illegal during the war, and this change in the law enabled Willard to pay the down payment in paper currency.<ref name="SupremeCourt" /><ref name="Goode205" /> The Court also held that the terms of the lease did not provide for a re-evaluation of the worth of the hotel, and that Willard was entitled to the original $22,500 purchase price.<ref name="SupremeCourt" /> For many years, the decision was the leading case in [[contract]] law regarding intent and enforcement.<ref>"Events Subsequent to the Contract As a Defence to Specific Performance," ''Columbia Law Review,'' May 1916, p. 411.</ref>

===Later life===
Tayloe married Phoebe Warren, one of his wife's friends, on April 17, 1849.<ref name="Lockwood160" /><ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 39.</ref> The Tayloe household became a hub of entertaining and political activity once more after Whig [[Zachary Taylor]] became President in 1849.<ref name="Watson40">Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 40.</ref> Tayloe remained an influential figure in national Whig politics even after Taylor's death on July 9, 1850, and the assumption of [[Millard Fillmore]] to the presidency.<ref name="Watson40" /> Tayloe made the first of two trips to Alabama to visit his business there in late 1850, and spent some time in the city of [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], before traveling to [[Havana]], [[Cuba]].<ref name="Watson40" /> Although Tayloe was an influential backer of Fillmore for re-election in 1852, he was on intimate terms with General [[Winfield Scott]], the candidate who defeated Fillmore for the Whig nomination for president.<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 41-42.</ref>

During this period, Tayloe was also a director of the Monument Association, which was striving to build the [[Washington Monument]].<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 43.</ref> He was elected president of the Board of Trustees of the Washington Orphan Asylum in 1855, and from 1865 until his death in 1868 was president of the Society of the Oldest Inhabitants (an association of citizens who had lived in the District of Columbia at least 20 years).<ref name="Watson45">Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 45.</ref> In the 1850s and 1860s he was regularly asked to run for [[List of mayors of Washington, D.C.|Mayor of Washington]], but declined every time.<ref name="Watson45" /> He was a very close friend of [[Francis Napier, 10th Lord Napier]], the [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to the United States|Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States]] from 1857 to 1859.<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 48.</ref>

In the critical [[United States presidential election, 1860|presidential election of 1860]], with the Whig Party in disarray, Tayloe worked to elect former Senator [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] (running as the candidate of the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]]).<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 68-69.</ref><ref>The Constitutional Union Party was made up of Whigs who wanted to avoid disunion over the issue of slavery. See: Rhodes, ''History of the United States: From the Compromise of 1850 to the McKinley-Bryan Campaign of 1896,'' 2009, p. 410.</ref> He attempted to convince the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Southern Democratic Party]] candidate, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John C. Breckinridge]], to withdraw his candidacy in favor of a "fusion" party that would defeat the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidate, [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 69-70.</ref> When Lincoln won the election, Tayloe met with the president-elect on November 8, 1860, and expressed his views on the need for Union in a letter which he handed to him.<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 71-72.</ref> Lincoln read it over twice, then said, "I am not yet elected President, and shall not be until I receive the vote of the [[Electoral college|electors]]."<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 72.</ref>

At the start of the Civil War, Tayloe was reputed to be the richest man in America.<ref name="Tidwell5960">Tidwell, ''April '65: Confederate Covert Action in the American Civil War,'' 1995, p. 59-60.</ref> But with the outbreak of war and the loss of his Alabama and Virginia lands, Tayloe lost more than half a million dollars (about $20.3 million dollars in inflation-adjusted 2010 dollars).<ref>"Some Notes From 'The Memorial of Benjamin Ogle Tayloe'," ''Tyler's Quarterly Historical and Genealogical Magazine,'' October 1920, p. 80.</ref><ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 87.</ref>

Some historians have alleged that Tayloe may have been a spy for the [[Confederate States of America]] during the Civil War. William Tidwell and others point out that he was a noted Southern sympathizer,<ref name="Tidwell5960" /><ref>Tidwell, Hall, and Gaddy, ''Come Retribution: The Confederate Secret Service and the Assassination of Lincoln,'' 1988, p. 74, 274.</ref> and that he had the education, skill, connections, and opportunity.<ref>Tidwell, Hall, and Gaddy, ''Come Retribution: The Confederate Secret Service and the Assassination of Lincoln,'' 1988, p. 68, 275.</ref> Tidwell has even alleged that Tayloe met with [[John B. Magruder]] and [[George Washington Custis Lee]] (son of [[Robert E. Lee]]), both men later to be [[General officer|generals]] in the [[Confederate States Army]], on April 21, 1861<U+2014>the day before Robert E. Lee left Washington, D.C., to join the rebel armies.<ref name="Tidwell74">Tidwell, Hall, and Gaddy, ''Come Retribution: The Confederate Secret Service and the Assassination of Lincoln,'' 1988, p. 74.</ref><ref name="Tidwell60">Tidwell, ''April '65: Confederate Covert Action in the American Civil War,'' 1995, p. 59-60.</ref> This left Tayloe in charge of a secret espionage ring in the city, it is claimed.<ref name="Tidwell5960" /><ref name="Tidwell74" /> Tayloe may also have helped provide funds to Confederate prisoners housed at the Old Capitol Prison in the city.<ref name="Tidwell60" /> It is even claimed that Tayloe may have helped conceive the kidnapping plot which later became a plan to kill President Lincoln.<ref>Tidwell, Hall, and Gaddy, ''Come Retribution: The Confederate Secret Service and the Assassination of Lincoln,'' 1988, p. 274, 281.</ref>

Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] lived in the house next door to Tayloe's. Seward was [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln#Powell attacks Secretary Seward|almost assassinated]] on the night of April 14, 1865, by [[Lewis Powell (assassin)|Lewis Powell]].<ref>Taylor, ''William Henry Seward: Lincoln's Right Hand,'' 2005, p. 243-245.</ref> Tayloe and his wife were one of the first people to enter the Seward house after the attack, and they stayed with the stricken Secretary of State all night long.<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 79-80.</ref>

==Death and estate==
Tayloe, his wife, and his son, Edward, left for an extended tour of Europe on May 16, 1866, touring England, Spain, France, Germany, Prussia, and Italy.<ref>Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 84-85.</ref> The family arried in Rome in January 1868.<ref name="Watson85">Watson, ''In Memoriam: Benjamin Ogle Tayloe,'' 1872, p. 84-85.</ref> Edward returned to the United States, and after his departure Tayloe began to experience weakness (but did not seem seriously ill).<ref name="Watson85" /> He became paralyzed on February 25, 1868, and died a few hours later.<ref name="Watson85" />

Phoebe Tayloe inherited the house upon his death.<ref name="Smith256" /><ref name="Lockwood161">Lockwood, ''Historic Homes in Washington: Its Noted Men and Women,'' 1889, p. 161.</ref> After she died in 1881, more than 200 marble statues, bronze sculptures, fine furniture, and paintings in the house were donated to the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]].<ref name="Smith256" /><ref name="Lockwood161" /><ref>Jarvis, ''Trolley Trips In and About Fascinating Washington,'' 1900, p. 98-99; ''Rand, McNally & Co.'s Pictorial Guide to Washington and Environs,'' 1903, p. 131.</ref>
