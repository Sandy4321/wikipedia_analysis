'''''Rock Band''''' is a [[music video game]] developed by [[Harmonix Music Systems]], published by MTV Games and Electronic Arts. It is the first title in the [[Rock Band|''Rock Band'' series]]. The [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] versions were released in the United States on November 20, 2007,<ref name="gamespy-preview">{{cite web | url = http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/harmonix-music-project/828392p1.html | title = ''Rock Band'' Preview | publisher = [[GameSpy]] | first = Sal | last = Accardo | date = October 18, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-07-24}}</ref> while the [[PlayStation 2]] version was released in the U.S. on December 18, 2007.<ref name="wii release">{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/rock-band-officially-rocking-wii |title=Rock Band Officially Rocking Wii| publisher=Next Generation |date=March 24, 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref>  The Wii version being released on June 22nd 2008. The game was released in Canada for the PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 on December 22, 2007 and for the PlayStation 2 on January 2, 2008. It was released in parts of Europe on the PS3, 360 and Wii on May 23, 2008 while the PS2 version was released on September 22.

''Rock Band'' allows up to four players to simulate the performance of popular [[rock music]] songs by playing with [[game controller|controller]]s modeled after musical instruments. Players can play the [[lead guitar]], [[bass guitar]], and [[drum kit|drums]] parts to songs with "instrument controllers", as well as sing through a [[USB]] [[microphone]]. Players are scored on their ability to match scrolling musical "[[note]]s" while playing instruments, or by their ability to match the singer's pitch on vocals. Players with the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions can interact through both online and offline multiplayer capabilities. In addition to the [[List of songs in Rock Band|58 core songs included on the game disc]], over 1000 [[Rock Band#Downloadable songs|downloadable songs]] have been released for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii versions, with more added each week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/371546/harmonix-no-dlc-for-rock-band-wiiyet|title=Harmonix: No DLC for Rock Band Wii...Yet|last=Crecente|first=Brian|date=March 24, 2008|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=2008-03-24}}</ref>

At launch, the game software was made available in a bundle that packaged it together with the instrument peripherals, as well as for purchase separately. Individual instrument peripherals were released at a later date. The game has received widespread critical acclaim,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/938870.asp | title = ''Rock Band'' (Xbox 360) | publisher = [[Game Rankings]] | accessdate = 2008-01-21}}</ref> with sales of four million units and global revenues of $600 million.<ref name="salesfigure">{{cite web |url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/indepth/gaming/s/reuters/081009/tecnology/ctech_us_videogames_bands_tech_life |title=Virtual battle of the bands rocks on |author=John Gaudiosi |date=October 9, 2008 |work=[[Reuters]] |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] |accessdate=2008-10-21}}{{Dead link|date=March 2009}}</ref> Players have also made 30 million downloadable song purchases since ''Rock Band''{{'}}s release.<ref name="dlcfigures">{{cite web | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28147206/ | title = 'Rock Band' is going a little bit country | publisher = [[MSNBC]] | first = Krintin | last = Kalning | date = December 10, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-12-16}}</ref> The game's success prompted the release of the sequels, ''[[Rock Band 2]]'', ''[[The Beatles: Rock Band]]'', ''[[Lego Rock Band]]'', ''[[Green Day: Rock Band]]'', and ''[[Rock Band 3]]''.

==Gameplay==

<!--Bass is on the left in this picture, notice the blue "bass groove" lines. It can be on either side, in this screenshot it's on the left. The blue "bass groove" allows a player to get a multiplier of 6x.  Please stop changing this. -->
[[Image:Rock-band-screen.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Gameplay of a full band playing [[Metallica]]'s "[[Enter Sandman]]". Each instrument is represented by a different interface: bass guitar (right), drums (middle), lead guitar (left), vocals (top). The Band Meter (green meter on left) measures the performance of each band member, while the Energy Meter (gold meter beneath each interface) tracks each player's Overdrive.]]

Reusing many gameplay elements from the [[Guitar Hero|''Guitar Hero'' series]], ''Rock Band'' players use peripherals modeled after musical instruments to simulate the performance of [[rock music]]. Players use these instruments by playing scrolling musical "notes" on-screen in time with the music. ''Rock Band'' expands upon the ''Guitar Hero'' series, in that it offers gameplay for drums and vocals, in addition to lead and bass guitar.

''Rock Band'''s gameplay and on-screen interface uses a combination of elements from ''Guitar Hero'' and ''[[Karaoke Revolution]]''.<ref name="kotaku-gameinformer">{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/notag/rock-band-details-explosion-269074.php|title=Rock Band Details Explosion|publisher=Kotaku|first=Luke|last=Plunkett|date=June 14, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> ''Rock Band'' has up to three tracks of vertically scrolling colored music notes, one section each for lead guitar, drums, and bass.<ref name="kotaku-gameinformer" /> The colored notes on-screen correspond to buttons on the guitar and drum peripherals.<ref name="kotaku-gameinformer" /> For lead and bass guitar, players play their notes by holding down colored fret buttons on the guitar peripheral and pushing the controller's strum bar; for drums, players must strike the matching colored drumhead, or step on the pedal to simulate playing bass drum notes. Along the top of the screen is the vocals display, which scrolls horizontally, similar to ''Karaoke Revolution''. The lyrics display beneath green bars, which represent the pitch of the individual vocal elements.<ref name="kotaku-gameinformer" /> When singing vocals, the player must sing in [[relative pitch]] to the original vocals. A pitch indicator displays the singer's accuracy relative to the original pitch. The remainder of the screen is used to display the band's virtual characters as they perform in concert.

During cooperative play as a band, all players earn points towards a common score, though score multipliers and "Overdrive" are tracked separately for each player.<ref name="kotaku-gameinformer"/> Overdrive is collected during select portions of a song by successfully playing all white notes within that section (or by using the guitar controller's [[tremolo arm|whammy bar]] during white sustained notes).<ref name="overdrive">{{cite web|url= http://rockband.scorehero.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1105|title=ScoreHero Invades Harmonix (Rock Band Impressions)|publisher=ScoreHero|date=October 19, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> Once the Energy Meter is filled halfway, players can deploy their Overdrive, resulting in the "Band Meter" (which tracks how well each player is doing) changing more dramatically. This allows players to strategically use Overdrive to raise the Band Meter and pass portions of a song they otherwise might have failed. Overdrive can be used to activate score multipliers, which vary based on a player's note streak. Players can deploy Overdrive independently of each other, as well as collect additional Overdrive while it is deployed and draining.<ref name="overdrive" />

Each band member can choose the difficulty at which they play (spanning Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert). If a player does not play well enough and falls to the bottom of the Band Meter, they will fail out of the song and their instrument will be muted from the audio mix. However, any active player can activate their Overdrive to bring failed players back into the song,<ref name="kotaku-gameinformer"/> "saving" the band member. However, a band member can only be saved twice; after the third failure, they cannot be brought back for that song. Failed players continuously drag the band's Band Meter down until they are saved. If the player is not saved before the Band Meter reaches the bottom, the band fails the song. Players can earn Overdrive bonuses from "Unison Phrases" and extra points from a "Big Rock Ending."

Unlike the PlayStation 2 and Wii version, players with the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 versions can create and customize their own in-game character, complete with adjustable hair, body physique, clothing, [[tattoo]]s, onstage movements, and instruments. Each character is permanently locked into a specific instrument. Using cash earned within the game, the player may purchase items at the in-game "Rock Shop," with which they can customize their rock star. The game features an art maker where players can combine different [[clip art]] elements to create custom face paint, tattoos, clothing designs, instrument artwork, and band logos.<ref name="ign-preview">{{cite web|title=Pre-E3 2007: Rock Band Hands-On|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/801/801493p1.html|author=Blevins, Tal and Jeremy Dunham|publisher=IGN|date=July 4, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref>

===Instrument peripherals===
[[Image:Rockband-guitar.jpg|thumb|125px|right|The [[Fender Stratocaster]] Controller, which features 10 [[frets]], a [[Tremolo arm|whammy bar]], and an [[effects unit|effects switch]].]]
The game features special ''Rock Band''-branded guitar controllers modeled after the [[Fender Stratocaster]] to be used for the lead and bass guitar gameplay. These are similar to the ''Guitar Hero'' controllers, as they feature five colored fret buttons on the neck, a strum bar, and a whammy bar. The Stratocaster controller has five additional fret buttons of smaller size located closer to the guitar's main body. These buttons can be used to play all notes in guitar solos (denoted by the note track turning blue) as [[hammer-on]]s and [[pull-off]]s, without the need to  strum.<ref name="kotaku-gameinformer"/> Additionally, the controller features an effects pickup switch that can toggle between five different effects, which are applied in solos and when Overdrive is activated. Overdrive for guitarists can be deployed by holding the controller in a vertical position or pressing the "Select/Back" button. The controller is offered in both wired and wireless versions.<ref name="rb-website" /> Harmonix has confirmed most ''Guitar Hero'' guitar controllers and additional third-party controllers are compatible with the game.<ref name="kotaku-gameinformer"/><ref name="rb-website" /> The Stratocaster controller is not compatible with Guitar Hero II or III.

[[Image:Rockband-drumset.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The drum controller, which features 4 pads, a bass drum pedal, and real drumsticks.]]
The drum controller features four rubber drum pads and a kick pedal. The pads have colored rings around the edges that correspond to the notes on-screen, representing the [[snare drum]] (red), [[hi-hat cymbal|hi-hat]] (yellow), [[tom-tom drum|tom-tom]] (blue), and [[crash cymbal]] (green). The kick pedal simulates the [[bass drum]], with on-screen notes represented as orange horizontal lines. A pair of authentic [[drum stick]]s are included with the controller. Drummers can improvise in special "freestyle [[fill (music)|drum fill]]" sections of songs, indicated by the columns for each note turning a solid color. Overdrive for drummers can be deployed by hitting the crash cymbal (green note for right-handed configuration) that appears directly after a freestyle drum fill. Harmonix representatives have suggested, "If you can play the drum parts on hard, you can pretty much play the drums [in reality]."<ref name="ign-preview"/><ref name="rb-website"/>

''Rock Band''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] microphone instrument is similar to the model used in the Harmonix-developed ''[[Karaoke Revolution]]'' games. For the most part, singers are judged on how closely they match the [[relative pitch]] of the song's vocalist. During "talking parts" that do not judge pitch, a [[phoneme]] detector will pick up individual vowels and consonants of the spoken lyrics.<ref name="kotaku-gameinformer" /><ref name="gameinformer-preview">{{Citation|title=Rock Band: The New Album|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|pages=62<U+2013>69|date=July 2007}}</ref> Some sections without vocals will display circle notes, allowing for the microphone to be used as a [[tambourine]] and [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]] by tapping it or making vocal cues. Overdrive for singers can be deployed by singing in freestyle vocal sections of songs, denoted by yellow artwork in the background of the vocals interface.

===Band World Tour mode===
[[Image:Rockband-band-world-tour.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The world map in Band World Tour, which allows the band to select a city, venue, and setlist.]]
"Band World Tour" is the game's primary multiplayer mode. It allows any combination of 2-4 local players to create a virtual band, play gigs, and tour a virtual representation of the world. Although online play is not supported for Band World Tour, players can use the "Band Quickplay" mode to play together as a band online.<ref name="bwt-no-online"><!-- alternative link: http://www.rockband.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5687&page=3 -->{{cite web | url = http://www.rockband.com/forums/showpost.php?p=82720&postcount=22 | title = Single post in "Uh oh..." thread - Official Rock Band Forums | accessdate = 2008-07-24 | quote = "Band World Tour (and consequently the endless setlist) doesn't have an online mode. It was something we really wanted in there but the time to do it [...] was seriously prohibitive. It is something we are totally working for in the future as not only do you want to play it but so do we (more than you know). That said we do have our band quickplay and the competitive modes online and it they are amazing. Sorry for the confusion." }}</ref> For the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game, Band World Tour mode lets bands play in 41 different venues spanning 17 cities, including [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[New York City|New York]], [[London]], [[Sydney]], [[Stockholm]], and [[Rome]].<ref name="venue">{{cite web|url=http://ps3.gamespy.com/playstation-3/rock-band/825937p1.html|title=On Location With Rock Band|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=October 9, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> After creating their band, characters, and logo, the players can begin playing concerts in small venues in their hometown until they unlock vans, tour buses and private jets, which unlock other cities and continents. Successful performances also earn the band fans, stars, and in-game cash.<ref name="gamespot-worldtour" /> Most cities and larger venues require the band to achieve a certain number of fans and stars before they are unlocked. In-game venues are inspired by real-life venues and often display local art styles from each of the represented cities.<ref name="venue" />

For the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, rather than complete predetermined lists of songs (like in previous ''Guitar Hero'' games), players complete unique sets of activities at each venue. Performances consist of single songs, multiple song sets, "make your own" setlists, and mystery setlists.<ref name="gamespot-worldtour">{{cite web|url= http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/puzzle/rockband/news.html?sid=6181200|title=Rock Band Exclusive - Rock Around the World | publisher=[[GameSpot]]|first=Brad|last=Shoemaker|date=October 17, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> Players are also faced with decisions that Harmonix refers to as "risk-versus-reward."<ref name="gamespot-worldtour" /> For certain performances, bands are faced with an optional challenge that requires the band to average a certain amount of stars for their gig in order to reap the rewards.<ref name="gamespot-worldtour" /> Bands can also choose to perform a benefit concert (earning no in-game money but gaining more fans) or "[[selling out|sell-out]]" (earning more in-game money but losing fans).<ref name="gamespot-worldtour" /> Additionally, for certain gigs, bands can compete for band personnel, as well as a recording deal with a record label.<ref name="gamespot-worldtour" /> The "Endless Setlist" provides players with all-day concert experience, as the setlist requires playing the entire game disc's setlist from start to finish.<ref name="scorehero-website-10192007">{{cite web|url= http://rockband.scorehero.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1107|title=Rock Band Exclusive: The Endless Setlist|publisher= ScoreHero|date=October 19, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref>

The PlayStation 2 and Wii versions of ''Rock Band'' contain a more stripped-down version of the Band World Tour mode, as 2<U+2013>4 local players will only be able to play by completing predetermined tiers of songs ordered by difficulty. Players cannot create their own characters, nor can they choose a city, venue, or a setlist to play.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/puzzle/rockband/news.html?sid=6184009|title=Rock Band Hands-On -- The PS2 Edition|publisher= [[GameSpot]]|first=Brad|last=Shoemaker|date=December 13, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref>

===Solo Tour modes===
"Solo Tour" is a single-player mode offered for the lead guitar, drum, and microphone peripherals (there is no support for bass). Rather than feature the open-ended gameplay and features of the next-generation versions of Band World Tour mode, Solo Tour is structured much in the same vein as the career mode in ''Guitar Hero'' games. Players choose/create their character (on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions only) and complete predetermined sets of songs ordered by difficulty, with each instrument's setlist ordered differently. By completing these sets of songs, additional songs are unlocked for play across all game modes. For the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, players can use money earned for each performance to purchase merchandise at the "Rock Shop". The character's cash carries over into Band World Tour mode, and vice versa.

===Other modes===
Players can quickly play any song on any instrument individually in "Solo Quickplay". For a competitive experience, players can individually compete against each other for each instrument type in the "Tug of War" (much like ''Guitar Hero''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s "Face-off", in which players trade playing sections of a song to move a meter in their favor) and "Score Duel" (much like ''Guitar Hero II''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s "Pro Face-off", in which each player plays the song in its entirety on the same difficulty level to earn points). These head-to-head modes are available both online (for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions) and locally.<ref name="ign-sept">{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/817/817823p1.html|title=IGN Rock Band Preview| publisher=IGN|first=Chris|last=Roper|date=September 4, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> "Band Quickplay" mode allows bands to quickly play any song; the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions allow any combination of 2<U+2013>4 local or online players to play as a band, while the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions only supports 2<U+2013>4 local players. Also included in ''Rock Band'' are "Tutorial Mode", which allows players to learn how to play each instrument, and "Practice Mode", which allows players to practice songs for each instrument.<ref name="rb-website">{{cite web|title = Rock Band Official Website|url=http://www.rockband.com/games/rockband|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref>

==Soundtrack==
{{Main|List of songs in Rock Band}}
All versions of ''Rock Band'' feature the same core 58 playable tracks on the game disc; 45 of these are featured tracks in the main setlist, while the other 13 tracks are "bonus songs" by independent or lesser-known bands, as well as bands made up of Harmonix employees.<ref name="rb-songlist">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockband.com/games/rockband|title=Rock Band Official Website: Song List|accessdate=2008-12-27}}</ref><ref name="final-soundtrack">{{cite web|url= http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/902/902400p2.html#rb1|title=Rock Band: The Complete Licensed Track List|publisher=IGN|first=Hilary|last=Goldstein|date=October 26, 2007|accessdate=2008-12-27}}</ref> In total, 51 of the 58 songs are master recordings. The Wii version of the game features 5 additional songs. Featured tracks include "[[Dani California]]" by [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], "[[(Don't Fear) The Reaper]]" by [[Blue <U+00D6>yster Cult]], "[[Enter Sandman]]" by [[Metallica]], "[[Here It Goes Again]]" by [[OK Go]], "[[Highway Star (song)|Highway Star]]" by [[Deep Purple]], "[[Learn to Fly]]" by [[Foo Fighters]], "[[Suffragette City]]" by [[David Bowie]], "[[Wanted Dead or Alive (Bon Jovi song)|Wanted Dead or Alive]]" by [[Bon Jovi]], and "[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]" by [[The Who]].  All but three songs on the ''Rock Band'' disc can be transferred to the user's hard drive on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 to be used for ''[[Rock Band 2]]''. Furthermore, an extra two songs from ''Rock Band'' cannot be carried over into ''Rock Band 3''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://weblogs.variety.com/the_cut_scene/2008/09/rock-band-1-to.html | title = Rock Band 1 to stay on sale as disc, no songs going online | first = Ben | last = Fritz | date = September 26, 2008 | publisher = ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' | accessdate = 2008-09-29}}</ref>

As both the PlayStation 2 and Wii version lack downloadable content, Harmonix is releasing a series of "Track Pack" standalone games that are sold in retail stores. Each volume contains several of the tracks available as downloadable content for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. ''Track Pack Vol. 2'' saw an expanded release on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, as well. One Track Pack, exclusively featuring the songs of [[AC/DC]]'s 1991 ''[[Live at Donington (AC/DC)|Live at Donington]]'' concert, was released in November 2008.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/54994 | title = First Rock Band Spin-off Revealed: AC/DC Live Coming As $30 Wal-Mart Exclusive | publisher = [[Shacknews]] | date = September 29, 2008 | first = Nick | last = Breckon | coauthors = Faylor, Chris | accessdate = 2008-09-29}}</ref>

==Development==
Harmonix Music Systems was previously responsible for making the [[Guitar Hero|''Guitar Hero'' series]], while [[RedOctane]] manufactured the peripherals and owned the rights to the series. However, in June 2006, RedOctane was bought by [[Activision]], while in September 2006, Harmonix was purchased by [[MTV Networks]]. As a result of the two purchases, Harmonix would no longer be able to develop future ''Guitar Hero'' games. Instead, [[Neversoft]], a subsidiary of Activision, would take over development; the company released ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'' on October 28, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/breaking-guitar-hero-development-goes-to-neversoft/69929/?biz=1|title=Breaking: ''Guitar Hero'' Development Goes to Neversoft|accessdate=2008-07-24|last=Brightman|first=James|date=January 16, 2007|publisher=GameDaily BIZ}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/puzzle/guitarhero2/news.html?sid=6157997|title=Guitar Hero going multi-platform|accessdate=2008-07-24|last=Sinclair|first=Brendan|date=September 20, 2006|publisher=GameSpot}}</ref> According to "[[The Business (radio)|The Business]]", the game cost $200 million to develop.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/tb/tb080128so_much_reality_tv_i/|title=So Much Reality TV It's Unreal!|date=January 28, 2008|accessdate=2008-01-30}}</ref> Harmonix's Vice President of Product Development, Greg LoPiccolo, stated that the game took about twenty months to develop, already having envisioned the possibility of different instruments before they were completed with the ''Guitar Hero'' series.<ref name="edge interview LoPiccolo">{{cite web | url = http://www.edge-online.com/magazine/harmonix-interview?page=0%2C0 | title = Harmonix Interview | publisher = ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' | date = October 20, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-10-21}}</ref>

In selecting the soundtrack for ''Rock Band'', the developers recognized that they needed to select songs that were recognizable, particularly on vocals; in contrast, when they were selecting songs for ''Guitar Hero'', they were able to pick songs that played better even if they were less recognizable.<ref name="av club interview">{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/articles/harmonix-music-systems,14273/ | title = Harmonix Music Systems | publisher = [[A.V. Club]] | first = Chris | last = Dahlen | date = 2008-07-17 | accessdate = 2009-05-12 }}</ref> They also consider songs that would help players come together socially, such as in [[The Who]]'s "[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]", where they retained the long synthesizer solo such that the band members would all start playing again after it for a big finish.<ref name="av club interview"/> The team were able to introduce songs from smaller artists that they felt were good additions, such as "Maps" by the [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]] and "Electric Version" by the [[New Pornographers]] to help also introduce players to those classes of music.<ref name="av club interview"/> For about half the songs, they hired a studio to sing along to the lyrics as a crowd would at a stadium, such that during the game, when players are performing well, the additional crowd sing-alongs would add to the performance experience.<ref name="av club interview"/>

Current Harmonix parent company MTV provided financial support to the development process, taking advantage of its stature to facilitate deals with record companies for licensing rights to songs.<ref name="USA Today" /> Several record companies pledged their support by offering [[master recording]]s.<ref name="Joystiq">{{cite web|url= http://www.joystiq.com/2007/04/02/usa-today-harmonix-announces-rock-band-for-xbox-360-ps3/|title="USA Today: Harmonix announces Rock Band for Xbox 360, PS3|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> Pressed for office space, Harmonix was forced to move its offices in the middle of ''Rock Band''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta period]] in order to support the company's 130-person staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/magazine/15-10/mf_harmonix_sb| title=A Glimpse Into Harmonix's Punk-Rock Design Process|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|first=Chris|last=Kohler|date=September 14, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> However, they continued to bring on more developers in order to complete the title on time.<ref name="rb postmortem">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4001/what_went_wrong_learning_from_.php | title = What Went Wrong?

Harmonix faced difficulty in making the Xbox 360 guitar wireless, as developers are charged a licensing fee to use Microsoft's wireless technology. Had Harmonix chosen to pay the fee, the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 bundles of ''Rock Band'' would have sold at different price points. Instead, Harmonix elected to choose a wired technology for the Xbox 360 bundle's guitar.<ref name="bbps" />

''Rock Band'' was first announced on April 1, 2007.<ref name="USA Today">{{cite web|url= http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2007-04-01-rock-band_N.htm |title=Music games won't be solo gigs anymore|first=Mike|last= Snider|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=April 1, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> Harmonix CEO Alex Rigopulos said in the announcement that ''Rock Band'' "takes the core premise of ''Guitar Hero'' and expands it tenfold. It lets you create a complete collaborative band."<ref name="USA Today" /> ''Rock Band'' was a featured game at the 2007 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] convention and provided one of the exhibition's highlights; Harmonix employees and Microsoft executive [[Peter Moore (business)|Peter Moore]] played the game on-stage, performing [[The Hives]]' "[[Main Offender (song)|Main Offender]]". Moore paused the game twice when he accidentally hit the guitar's Xbox Guide button.

A software update was released on March 21, 2008, which added new features to the game. The update included an in-game music store with preview and sorting options, revised microphone performance, and faster downloadable content loading.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rockband.com/forums/showthread.php?p=412007 | title = State of the Band - Rock Band Software Update Finalized! | publisher = Official Rock Band Forums | author = HMXspraynwipe | date = March 21, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-03-21}}</ref>

===Online community===
On October 25, 2007, Harmonix and MTV announced [http://www.rockband.com/ RockBand.com] would be transformed into an extensive community website at the game's launch, and that it would extend the features of the game. The community website was absent at the game's launch in order to fix bugs and complete features, but was deployed on December 19, 2007. The site allows for leaderboards, customizable band profile pages with stats, a classified area for bands to find additional members, band blogs, online forums, and other sharing features.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/community/rockbandcom-furthers-the-fantasy-314989.php|title=Rockband.com Furthers The Fantasy|publisher=Kotaku|last=Fahey|first=Mike|date=October 25, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> Many originally announced features, such as the ability for players to pose their avatars, take photo shoots and order T-shirts, bumper stickers, and figurines,<ref name="alex-oxm" /> were eventually made available on the website for ''Rock Band 2''.

==Release==
===Promotion===
MTV and Harmonix promoted ''Rock Band'' heavily in the months leading up to the game's release. The game made a nationwide promotional tour of the United States.<ref name="rb-tour">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6178281.html|title=Rock Band going on tour|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|first=Tor|last=Thorsen|date=September 6, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> Several tour buses made stops at major American cities to set up demo stations and showcase playable versions of the game for fans.<ref name="rb-tour" /> Many of the locations included college campuses. Additionally, fan-created "bands" were able to audition on-stage by playing the game; their performances were recorded and sent to MTV casting directors, who selected two bands to appear on ''[[Total Request Live]]'' in a "battle of the bands." The promotional tour commenced with a featured showcase at the [[MTV Video Music Awards]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] on September 9, 2007.<ref name="rb-tour" />

MTV will be investing in additional promotions that total about $30 million.<ref name="wsj">{{cite web|url= http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119370259805275665.html|title=For Those About to Pretend to Rock|publisher=Wall Street Journal|first=Nick|last=Wingfield|date=October 31, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> The game will be set up within the homes of ''[[The Real World]]'' participants, allowing for on-air visibility.<ref name="wsj" /> [[VH1]] also produced a brief spoof documentary in the style of ''[[Behind the Music]]'' titled "''Rock Band'' Cometh: The ''Rock Band'' Band Story," documenting a fictional band that plays the game.<ref name="wsj" />

The game has also appeared in demo [[Interactive kiosk|kiosks]] at [[Best Buy]], [[Wal-Mart]], and [[Sam's Club]] stores. The demo contains 15 songs and supports gameplay for all 4 instruments (although the actual in-store setup varies). The demo's drum set lacks a bass pedal, with the game automatically playing bass drum notes.

Other companies have also helped to promote ''Rock Band'' through free and reduced cost downloadable content.  [[Best Buy]] offered two free downloadable tracks by the band [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]] for customers that pre-ordered their ''[[Indestructible (Disturbed album)|Indestructible]]'' album online; these tracks were made available to all users in June 2008 for $.99/80MSP.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/52513 | title = Best Buy Promoting Exclusive Rock Band X360 DLC; Tracks Will Be Publicly Available in June (Updated) | publisher = [[Shacknews]] | date = May 5, 2008 | first = Chris | last = Faylor | accessdate = 2008-05-06}}</ref> [[McDonald's]] sponsored a month-long program that reduced the cost of two selected downloadable tracks to [[USD|$]]1 (approximately half the standard cost) for each week during the month of May 2008 as part of their Dollar Menu promotion.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/52540 | title = Rock Band DLC Goes On Sale Courtesy McDonald's | date = May 6, 2008-05-06 | publisher = [[Shacknews]] | first = Chris | last = Faylor | accessdate = 2008-05-06}}</ref>

===Technical issues and guitar incompatibility===
[[Image:RB Pedal Broken.JPG|thumb|200px|right|A snapped bass drum pedal. This is one common malfunction occurring in ''Rock Band'' peripherals]]
Upon release, many players reported hardware issues with ''Rock Band'' peripherals. Many complaints stemmed from the bass drum pedal snapping in half, the Stratocaster controller's strum bar being unresponsive, and it occasionally lagging when tilted to activate Overdrive.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://kotaku.com/gaming/buyer-beware/rock-band-guitar-controllers-failing-325595.php|title=Rock Band Guitar Controllers Failing|publisher=Kotaku|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|date=November 21, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> In response to these issues, Harmonix admitted the guitars bundled with initial shipment of the game bundles were subject to manufacturing issues  and has stated that they will replace all faulty peripherals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/rock-band/harmonix-replacing-broken-rock-band-guitars-327610.php|title=Harmonix Replacing Broken Rock Band Guitars|publisher=Kotaku|first= Brian|last=Crecente|date=November 28, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> Players affected by faulty peripherals can take advantage of the 60 day warranty on the peripherals and obtain replacements from EA. However, a [[class action lawsuit]] has been issued against Harmonix, MTV Games, Viacom, and Electronic Arts over the failures of the bass drum pedal, claiming the companies conspired to force consumers to pay for repairs or upgrade to the ''Rock Band 2'' drum kit.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/56041 | title = Harmonix Gets Rock Band 2 Class Action Lawsuit | first = Blake | last = Ellison | date = November 21, 2008 | publisher = [[Shacknews]] | accessdate = 2008-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamekiq.com/wordpress/2008/11/24/harmonix-ea-sued-for-rock-band-sued-for-faulty-broken-pedals/ | title = The Saga Continues: Rock Band Makers Sued for Faulty Pedals | first = Mark | last = Nolan | date = November 24, 2008 | publisher = [[GameKiq]] | accessdate = 2008-11-24}}</ref> Attempts were made to settle the lawsuit in 2008, but were unsuccessful.

Other players discovered at the game's launch that the [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar controller bundled with the PlayStation 3 version of ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'' was initially not compatible with the PlayStation 3 version of ''Rock Band'', despite Harmonix stating that any controllers that followed the open-controller standard would work.  While this incompatibility could have been resolved through technical solutions, both Harmonix and Activision cited the other party as being at fault for failing to correct the incompatibility. Harmonix developed a patch to fix the issue, but it was blocked by Activision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/playstation-3/activision-blocks-rock-band-patch-kills-ghiii-guitar-support-333236.php|title=Activision Blocks Rock Band Patch, Kills GHIII Guitar Support | publisher=Kotaku|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|date=December 12, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> Activision stated that MTV Games was unwilling to reach an agreement to pay Activision to use the ''Guitar Hero III'' technology in ''Rock Band''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/50387|title=Activision Responds to Harmonix/MTV Accusations: Harmonix 'Unwilling to Discuss an Agreement'|publisher=Shacknews|date=December 13, 2007|first=Chris|last=Remo|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> This incompatibility also applies to the Wii's Les Paul peripheral.

At a press conference at the 2008 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] convention, Activision confirmed that the Xbox 360 version of ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]'' will be able to use ''Rock Band''{{'}}s instruments, adapting the note tracks to account for the smaller number of drum pads, and that this compatibility was patched into ''Guitar Hero: Aerosmith'' as a result of additional arrangements.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2008/07/16/guitar-hero-world-compatible-with-rock-band/ | title = Activision: <U+2018>Guitar Hero: World Tour<U+2019> Is Compatible With <U+2018>Rock Band<U+2019> Instruments | publisher = MTV | date = July 16, 2008 | first = Stephan | last = Tolito | accessdate = 2008-07-16}}</ref><ref name="wired rb instruments">{{cite web | url = http://blog.wired.com/games/2008/07/xbox-rock-band.html | title = Xbox Rock Band Instruments Work With New Guitar Hero | date = July 15, 2008 | first = Chris | last = Kohler | publisher = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | accessdate = 2008-07-16}}</ref> Specific details between Harmonix and Activision's resolution to allow this have not yet been made.

Prior to release, EA CEO John Riccitielo remarked that the company would not be able to meet the high demand for ''Rock Band'' in the 2007 holiday season, stating, "We're not going to be able to put enough inventory to meet demand in North America or Europe this calendar year or this fiscal [year]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/rock-band/time-to-start-worrying-about-rock-band-availability-318040.php|title=Rock Band: Time to Start Worrying About Availability|publisher= Kotaku | first=Luke|last=Plunkett|date=November 1, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> This prompted many retailers to limit the number of preorders they sold before the game was released.

''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' published the first review of ''Rock Band'', scoring the Xbox 360 version a 9.5/10 and calling it "gaming's most intensely rewarding co-op experience." ''OXM'' also commented that the game's "payoff isn't visceral or technical; it's emotional."<ref name="oxm-review" /> [[IGN]] awarded the game a 9.4/10 score and an Editor's Choice Award for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions. IGN largely praised the game, calling it "one of the must-have games of the year" and suggesting it "may just be among the best party games ever released."<ref name="ign-review">{{cite web|url= http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/836/836118p1.html|title=Rock Band Review|author=Hilary Goldstein, Tal Blevins, Erik Brudvig, and David Clayman|publisher=IGN|date=November 16, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> [[1UP.com]] gave the next-generation versions of the game an A,<ref name="1up-review" /> stating that "''Rock Band'' unquestionably, unequivocally rocks." [[GameSpot]] rated the next-generation versions of the game a 9.0/10, calling ''Rock Band'' "one of the best party games of all time." They also gave the game their Editor's Choice award.<ref name="gamespot-review" /> The Xbox 360 version of ''Rock Band'' has an average critic score of 92%, according to [[Metacritic]], tying it for the 11th highest scored Xbox 360 game to date, as of October 2008.<ref name="metacritic-360">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/xbox360/scores/|title=Index of Xbox 360 Game Reviews by Score|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2008-10-29}}</ref> Similarly, the PlayStation 3 version of ''Rock Band'' has an average critic score of 92% on Metacritic, making it the 7th highest scored PlayStation 3 game to date, as of November 2008.<ref name="metacritic-ps3">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/ps3/scores/|title=Index of PlayStation 3 Game Reviews by Score|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref>

Most critics<ref name="1up-review" /><ref name="GI-review" /><ref name="gamespot-review" /><ref name="ign-review" /><ref name="oxm-review" /> have commended the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of ''Rock Band'' for the game's group gameplay, the depth of Band World Tour mode, and the introduction of a drum peripheral. Common complaints about the game focus on the different feel of the packaged Fender Stratocaster controller,<ref name="GI-review" /><ref name="ign-review" /><ref name="oxm-review" /> as well as the game's Solo Tour modes not being as enjoyable as the multiplayer offerings.<ref name="1up-review" /><ref name="ign-review" /> IGN's video review lamented the lack of a single player Band World Tour mode.

The PlayStation 2 version of the game was well received, but was subject to criticism for the omission of the character customization features, as well as the stripped-down Band World Tour mode. GameSpot rated it an 8.0/10, stating that "''Rock Band'' is still a lot of fun on the PS2<U+2014>it's just nowhere near the ideal version of the experience."<ref name="gamespot-review-ps2" /> IGN.com rated it an 8.4/10, noting that the removed features made the game feel like a "lessened" version, but that the game still "succeeds because it's infinitely fun to play with your friends."<ref name="ign-review-ps2" />

Reviews for the Wii version of ''Rock Band'' also criticize the lack of features compared to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. The Wii version is basically the same as its PlayStation 2 counterpart, but IGN criticized it for its late release and their effort in completing a full game. However, IGN notes that the drum controller is an improvement over the original version, stating, "The pads are quieter and the kick pedal will withstand more abuse."<ref name="ign-review-wii" />

===Sales===
As of October 9, 2008, the game has sold four million units and generated global revenues of $600 million.<ref name="salesfigure"/> The sales of ''Rock Band'' have helped [[Viacom]] to become the fifth largest video game publisher in the United States, although analysts estimate that Viacom is only breaking even on sales of the game.<ref name="dow jones sales"/> In a March 2011 list, the NPD Group listed ''Rock Band'' as the 5th highest grossing video game in the United States since 1995, earning $670.7 million in revenue.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cnbc.com/id/42253109?__source=yahoo|headline|quote|text|&par=yahoo | title = Call of Duty, Guitar Hero Top All-Time Best Selling List | publisher = [[CNBC]] | first = Chris | last = Morris | date = 2011-03-24 | accessdate = 2011-03-24 }}{{cite web | url = http://www.cnbc.com/id/42252946?slide=1 | title=  The Best Selling Video Games of This Generation | date = 2011-03-24 | accessdate = 2011-03-24 | publisher = [[CNBC]] }}</ref>

===Patent litigation===
On March 21, 2008, EA, MTV, and Harmonix were sued by the [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]] for violation of the 1999 {{US patent|5990405}}, which Gibson claims covers technology that simulates a concert performance via pre-recorded audio and a musical instrument; this follows similar action that Gibson has taken against the ''Guitar Hero'' series, which was later settled out of court.<ref>[http://www.joystiq.com/2009/04/25/activision-and-gibson-settle-guitar-hero-patent-lawsuit/ Activision and Gibson settle Guitar Hero patent lawsuit<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Gibson-Harmonix case was put on hold shortly after its filing to allow the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] to open a re-examination of the 405 patent. On subsequent review, the 405 patent was modified to more exactly define the type of musical instrument that the patent covers, as the original language had conflicted with {{US patent|5488196}}. Due to the change in language, Harmonix is seeking to have the case go forward and request a summary judgement, believing that the new language of 405 does not include the ''Rock Band'' controllers.<ref>[http://www.patentarcade.com/2009/10/back-on-stage-in-guitar-herogibson-suit.html Patent Arcade: Back on Stage in the Guitar Hero/Gibson Suit?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In mid 2010, the case was settled between all parties under non-disclosed terms.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/28868/Gibson_Settles_Another_Music_Game_Patent_Case.php | title = Gibson Settles Another Music Game Patent Case | first=  Leigh | last =Alexander | date = 2010-06-08 | accessdate = 2010-06-08 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref>

On July 10, 2008, [[Konami]] filed a separate lawsuit against Harmonix, [[Viacom]], and MTV attempting to block the sale of ''Rock Band'', over infringement of their patents on a "musical-rhythm matching game" issued in 2002 and 2003, including {{US patent|6390923}}.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&sid=aHQODoKwFYrA&refer=japan | title = Konami Sues Viacom Over 'Rock Band' Music Video Game | publisher = [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] | date = July 10, 2008 | first = Susan | last = Decker | accessdate = 2008-07-10}}</ref> An MTV spokesperson expressed that the lawsuit was "extremely surprising" and that they intend to defend themselves against the suit.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1590762/20080711/id_0.jhtml | title = 'Rock Band' Creators Sued By 'Rock Revolution' Publisher Konami | publisher = MTV | date = July 11, 2008 |first = Stephen | last = Totilo | accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref> On December 2, 2008, Viacom issued a countersuit against Konami, claiming that ''Rock Band'' significantly improves on Konami's original patent, and that their ''[[Rock Revolution]]'' game uses controllers that are similar to ''Rock Band''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&sid=a0AELrnWrYbg&refer=japan | title = Viacom's Harmonix Sues Konami Over 'Rock Revolution' | first = Susan | last = Decker | publisher = [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] | date = February 2, 2009 | accessdate = 2009-02-12}}</ref> Both suits were settled for undisclosed terms in September 2010.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/30495/Konami_Viacom_Settle_Rock_Band_Suit.php | title = Konami, Viacom Settle Rock Band Suit | first = Tom | last = Curtis | date = 2010-09-17 | accessdate = 2010-09-17 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref>
