'''''Golden Sun''''', released in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''<U+014C>gon no Taiy<U+014D> Hirakareshi F<U+016B>in'''''|<U+9EC4><U+91D1><U+306E><U+592A><U+967D> <U+958B><U+304B><U+308C><U+3057><U+5C01><U+5370>||literally "'''''Golden Sun: The Broken Seal'''''"}}, is the first installment of a [[Golden Sun (series)|series]] of fantasy [[Console role-playing game|role-playing]] video games developed by [[Camelot Software Planning]] and published by [[Nintendo]]. It was released in November 2001 for Nintendo's [[Game Boy Advance]], with a Game Boy Advance sequel, ''[[Golden Sun: The Lost Age]]'', in 2003. The game is notable for certain unique game elements, such as the use of special "[[Genie|Djinn]]" that empower the player and can be used against enemies.

''Golden Sun''{{'}}s story follows a band of magic-attuned "adepts" who are sent from their home town into the wide world of Weyard to prevent the potentially destructive power of [[alchemy]] from being released as it was in the past. Along the way the adepts gain new abilities, help out the local populations, and learn more about why alchemy was sealed away. The story continues in a sequel, ''[[Golden Sun: The Lost Age]]''.

Upon its release, the game was highly praised; [[IGN]] said that ''Golden Sun'' could "arguably be one of the best 2D-based Japanese RPGs created for any system."<ref name=ignreview>{{cite web|author=Harris, Craig|date=2001-11-09|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/165/165255p1.html|title=IGN ''Golden Sun'' Review|publisher=ign.com|accessdate=February 1 2007}}</ref> The game went on to sell over one million copies in Japan and the United States alone. A second sequel, ''[[Golden Sun: Dark Dawn]]'', will be released in 2010.

== Gameplay ==
[[Image:GoldenSunPsynergy.png|thumb|left|''Golden Sun''{{'}}s form of magic, psynergy, can be used in battle and in dungeons. Here, a cold spell is used to create a navigable path of frozen ice pillars from puddles of water.]]
''Golden Sun'' is a contemporary presentation of the traditional [[console role-playing game]] formula, where the player guides a cast of four characters as they journey through a fantasy-themed game world, interact with other characters, battle many monsters, acquire increasingly powerful magic spells and equipment, and take part in a building, predefined narrative.<ref>{{cite book|year=2002|editor=Camelot|title=Golden Sun Instruction Manual|page=3|publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> While many actions the player takes are compulsory, ''Golden Sun'' often allows the player to complete certain objectives out of order, and to visit previous locations, which can advance minor story elements.

Much of the game's time spent outside of battle takes place in [[dungeon crawl|dungeons]], caves, and other locales that feature puzzles integrated into their layout.<ref name=advice/> Among the various activities one must perform to make progress through the game world and story is pushing logs into rivers to cross them, shifting the track of a mine cart to allow access to new areas, and more.<ref name=advice>{{cite book|year=2002|editor=Camelot|title=Golden Sun Instruction Manual: Advice for Adepts|pages=50<U+2013>53|publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> Many of these puzzles revolve heavily around the usage of the game's resident form of [[magic (fantasy)|magic spells]], "Psynergy" ("Energy" in the Japanese version), and many specific utility Psynergy spells require the player to find and earn items that grant the spells in order to use them.<ref>{{cite book|year=2002|editor=Camelot|title=Golden Sun Instruction Manual: Psynergy|page=18|publisher=Nintendo}}</ref>

Successful exploration of the game's world and conduction of the game's battles is heavily dependent on the strategic usage of the extensive pool of Psynergy spells available.<ref name="psynergy">{{cite web|url=http://www.goldensun.rpgplanet.gamespy.com/gs/psynergy.php|title=Psynergy List|publisher=Goldensun.rpgplanet.gamespy.com|accessdate=July 10 2006}}</ref> Whereas many other [[Console role-playing game|RPGs]] limit the usage of their forms of magic to battles as offensive and defensive measures, Psynergy spells can be used both for battle, and for solving puzzles in the game's locales.<ref name=ae>{{cite web|date=2001-12-08|author=Flowe, Doug|url=http://www.armchairempire.com/Reviews/gba/golden_sun.htm|title=GBA Reviews: Golden Sun|publisher=armchairempire.com|accessdate=2007-09-19}}</ref> A portion of the game's Psynergy can only be used in combat; conversely, many spells are only used in the game's [[overworld]] and non-battle scenarios. At the same time, there are Psynergy spells can be used in both situations; for example, the "Whirlwind" spell that can be used to damage enemies in battle is also used out of battle to clear away overgrown foliage that may block the player's path.<ref>{{cite book|year=2002|editor=Camelot|title=Golden Sun Instruction Manual: Advice for Adepts|page=51|publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> Psynergy comes in four elements: [[Venus]] (manipulation of rocks and plants), [[Mars]] (revolving around fire and heat), [[Jupiter]] (based on wind and electricity), and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] (concerning water and ice).<ref>{{cite book|year=2002|editor=Camelot|title=Golden Sun Instruction Manual: Djinn|page=16|publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> The player gains more Psynergy spells as the game progresses, both through [[Experience point|leveling up]] and the acquisition of special Psynergy-bestowing items, and with each "utility" Psynergy spell the party gains access to more locations and secrets hidden in the game world. Players can return to previous locations in the game to finish puzzles which they could not solve earlier because of the lack of a specific Psynergy spell.<ref name=advice/>

=== Battle ===
[[Image:GoldenSunBattle.png|thumb|right|Battles in ''Golden Sun'' have many special effects. Here, a weapon specific attack is unleashed by the sword Gaia Blade.]]
''Golden Sun'' contains both [[random encounter|random monster encounters]], featuring randomly selected enemies,<ref name=allgame>{{cite web|url=http://allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&sql=1:35091|title=Allgame: ''Golden Sun''|publisher=allgame.com|accessdate=2007-09-20}}</ref> and compulsory battles involving set enemies, which advance the story. When a battle begins, a separate screen is brought up where the player's party and enemy party face-off on opposing sides. During a battle, the characters and the background rotate to give a pseudo-[[3D computer graphics|3D]] effect.<ref name="spaceworld"/>

The gameplay in relation to ''Golden Sun'''s battle mode is similar to traditional [[Console role-playing game|console RPGs]]. In each battle, the player is required to defeat each enemy by a variety of measures, including direct attacks with weapons, offensive Psynergy spells, powerful Djinni, and there is also defending, all the while keeping the player's own party alive through items and supportive Psynergy that restore life and supplement defense.<ref>{{cite book|year=2002|editor=Camelot|title=Golden Sun Instruction Manual: Shops, Inns, and Sanctums|page=34|publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> If the player's entire party is downed by reducing their [[hit points]] to zero, it is considered "Game Over", and the party is returned to the last Sanctum that the player visited with only Isaac alive with one hitpoint left, and suffers a monetary penalty. The successful completion of a battle yields [[experience points]], coins, powerful psynergy, and sometimes [[item (gaming)|items]].<ref name=rpg>{{cite web|author=Nguyen, Chase|url=http://www.allrpg.com/games/goldensun/index.php3?page=review&num=2|title=Golden Sun|publisher=allrpg.com|accessdate=2007-09-20|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070603152912/http://www.allrpg.com/games/goldensun/index.php3?page=review&num=2|archivedate=2007-06-03}}</ref>

In addition to the main game itself, there is also a competitive battling mode accessible from the menu screen. In this mode, players can enter their currently-developed team from their saved game files into an arena environment where they can either battle increasingly difficult CPU-controlled enemies with their full parties, or select three of their four party members to do battle against another player's three-character team. In neither case is there a reward or penalty for winning or losing.<ref>{{cite book|year=2002|editor=Camelot|title=Golden Sun Instruction Manual: The Arena|pages=52<U+2013>54|publisher=Nintendo}}</ref>

=== Djinn System ===
One of the most distinctive features of ''Golden Sun'' is the collecting and manipulation of magical creatures called [[Genie|Djinn]] ''(Singular: Djinni)''. Djinn, based on each of the four classical elements, can be found scattered in hiding throughout the game and are allocated to each character.  The Djinn form the basis of the game's statistic enhancement, as well as the system that dictates the character's Psynergy capabilities.<ref name=p19>{{cite book|year=2002|editor=Camelot|title=Golden Sun Instruction Manual: Djinn and their Abilities|page=19|publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> Attaching different Djinn to different characters modifies that character's [[character class]], subsequently modifying hit points, Psynergy points, and other statistics, as well as determining what Psynergy the character is able to perform.<ref name=p32>{{cite book|year=2002|editor=Camelot|title=Golden Sun Instruction Manual: Character Classes|page=32|publisher=Nintendo}}</ref>

In ''Golden Sun'', Djinn can either be "turned on" ("Set") or "turned off" ("On Standby"). When a Djinni is "Set" to a character, that Djinni exerts influence on that character's class<ref name=allgame /> (and therefore, his or her statistics and Psynergy collection) relative to both the character's innate element and that of the Djinni's.<ref name=p19/> As there are twenty-eight Djinn encompassing the four elements that can be mixed and matched to the four characters, a large array of possible class setups for all four characters are potentially available, allowing a variety of combat options.<ref>{{cite book|year=2002|editor=Camelot|title=Golden Sun Instruction Manual: Tips|page=50|publisher=Nintendo}}</ref>

In combat, a Djinni has several primary uses. Each Djinni has its own special ability which can be invoked during combat by the character it is attached to, which can include enhanced elemental attacks, [[Buff (MMORPG terminology)|buffing]] or debuffing spells, healing/restoration spells, and other effects. After a successful invoke, the Djinni shifts to "Standby" mode until it is "Set" on the character again.<ref>{{cite book|year=2002|editor=Camelot|title=Golden Sun Instruction Manual: Dijinn|page=44|publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> While in standby, the Djinn do not contribute to character classes or statistics, but can be used for summon sequences, which are attacks where the player summons a powerful elemental monster to inflict damage on every enemy. This is the game's most powerful method of attack, and also the riskiest, as it requires Djinn to be on Standby and therefore not be available to bolster the statistics of whatever character the Djinn are on.<ref>{{cite book|year=2002|editor=Camelot|title=Golden Sun Instruction Manual|pages=Appendix A|publisher=Nintendo|nopp=true}}</ref> Once a Djinni on Standby has been used for a Summon Sequence, it must rest a number of turns before it restores itself to Set position on a character. There are sixteen Summon Sequences in ''Golden Sun'', four for each element, and each summon sequence takes between one and four Djinn of the same element on Standby.

== Synopsis ==
=== Setting ===
''Golden Sun'', in both background and chain of events, takes place in a [[fantasy]] setting that may be considered fairly typical of classic-style RPGs. It is the world of "Weyard", a massive earth-like environment with several major continents and many oceans. Weyard is revealed by the game's sequel, ''[[Golden Sun: The Lost Age]]'', to be a setting modeled on the [[flat Earth]] ideal of the world; it is a flat, vaguely circular plane whose oceans perpetually spill off the edge of the world's entire perimeter into an endless abyss.<ref name="gaiafalls1">'''Male villager:''' The huge waterfall at the edge of the world is known as Gaia Falls. {{cite video game|title=Golden Sun: The Lost Age|developer=Camelot Software Planning|publisher=Nintendo|date=2003-04-14|platform=Game Boy Advance }}</ref><ref name="gaiafalls2">'''Old male villager:''' Well, at least Gaia Falls will put an end to a few silly arguments. After all, if it's got an edge and you can fall off it, the world is clearly FLAT! {{cite video game|title=Golden Sun: The Lost Age|developer=Camelot Software Planning|publisher=Nintendo|date=2003-04-14|platform=Game Boy Advance }}</ref> The plot progression of ''Golden Sun'' spans the two largest continents in the world's central region: The Eurasian-themed main continent of Angara to the north and the more African and Middle Eastern-inspired continent of Gondowan to the south.

Weyard is a world governed by the fictional, ancient concept of the [[classical elements]]. All matter on Weyard consists of any combination of the four base elements: Venus ([[Earth (classical element)|Earth]]), Mars ([[Fire (classical element)|Fire]]), Jupiter ([[Air (classical element)|Air]]), and Mercury ([[Water (classical element)|Water]]).<ref>{{cite book|year=2002|editor=Camelot|title=Golden Sun: A Forbidden Power Is Unleashed|pages=5<U+2013>6|publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> These four building blocks of reality can be manipulated by the omnipotent force of Alchemy, which used to reign supreme in the world's ancient past. Alchemy was sealed away in the past, however, and the world in the present age has become seemingly devoid of all magic. Various individuals throughout the world, however, each demonstrate an adeptness to manipulate one of the four elements through a [[ch'i|chi]]-like form of magic called Psynergy. These Adepts, as wielders of Psynergy are called, generally refrain from displaying their talents to outsiders of their various settlements.

=== Characters ===
{{main|List of characters in Golden Sun}}
The player controls a total of four characters of ''Golden Sun''. [[List of characters in Golden Sun#Isaac|Isaac]] is a seventeen-year-old Venus Adept from the village of Vale, who serves as the game's silent protagonist. [[List of characters in Golden Sun#Garet|Garet]], a seventeen-year-old Mars Adept also from Vale, is big and strong but slightly oafish and unfocused; nonetheless he is Isaac's closest companion. [[List of characters in Golden Sun#Ivan|Ivan]] is a fifteen-year-old Jupiter Adept who has lived with a famous merchant in the town of Kalay all his life, but whose real hometown is actually Contigo, a town on the continent of Atteka; he is a somewhat quiet, insightful boy. [[List of characters in Golden Sun#Mia|Mia]], a seventeen-year-old Mercury Adept from the wintry town of Imil, is a gentle healer from a heritage of Mercury Adept clansmen. She joins the group during the climb of the first Lighthouse. A fifth character seen and playable in the game's exposition sequence is the 17-year-old Mars Adept [[List of characters in Golden Sun#Jenna|Jenna]], another childhood friend to Isaac, and Felix's sister, in Vale.<ref name=adepts>{{cite book|year=2002|editor=Camelot|title=Golden Sun Instruction Manua: The Adepts|pages=14<U+2013>15|publisher=Nintendo}}</ref>

The primary antagonists of the game are [[List of characters in Golden Sun#Saturos and Menardi|Saturos and Menardi]], a pair of immensely powerful and talented Mars Adepts of a foreign race hailing from Prox, a town in the frigid north near Mars Lighthouse.<ref>{{cite book|year=2002|editor=Camelot|title=Golden Sun Instruction Manua: Isaac's Antagonists|page=15|publisher=Nintendo}}</ref> Their aim is to restore Alchemy to the world, and they are assisted by the powerful and mysterious Mercury Adept [[List of characters in Golden Sun#Alex|Alex]], of the same heritage as Mia, and Jenna's older brother, the 18-year-old Venus Adept [[List of characters in Golden Sun#Felix|Felix]], who is indebted to Saturos for the latter's saving Felix from death.<ref name=adepts/>

=== Plot ===
The force of Alchemy was prevalent in Weyard's ancient past, allowing for the development of great civilizations, but this eventually gave way to worldwide conflict that had subsided only with the sealing away of Alchemy.<ref name="agesago">'''In-game text:''' Ages ago, or so the stories tell, the power of Alchemy ruled over the world of Weyard. Alchemy wrought the base elements of humanity into thriving civilizations, like lead into gold. But in time, man's dreams gave birth to untold strife. Dreams of endless riches, of eternal life, of dominion over all that lived... Dreams of conquest and war. {{cite video game|title=Golden Sun: The Lost Age|developer=Camelot Software Planning|publisher=Nintendo|date=2003-04-14|platform=Game Boy Advance }}</ref> The keys to unlocking Alchemy, four magic jewels named the Elemental Stars, have been hidden within the mountain shrine, Mt. Aleph, which in turn has been guarded by the town of Vale at the mountain's base over the ages. Three years prior to the start of the game in the game's prologue, however, [[List of characters in Golden Sun#Saturos and Menardi|Saturos and Menardi]], along with a raiding party, raid Mt. Aleph with the intent to take the Elemental Stars for themselves, but fail to solve the riddles guarding them and are driven away by the mountain's trap, a magically generated thunderstorm and rock slide.<ref name="sattymenny">'''Menardi:''' How could we have anticipated Sol Sanctum would unleash such fury? / '''Saturos:''' It's a miracle that even the two of us were spared. / '''Menardi:''' That switch...

In the present, the teenaged adepts from Vale, [[List of characters in Golden Sun#Isaac|Isaac]], [[List of characters in Golden Sun#Garet|Garet]], and [[List of characters in Golden Sun#Jenna|Jenna]], join [[List of characters in Golden Sun#Kraden|Kraden]] in his research of Mt. Aleph,<ref name="alchemystudy">'''Dora:''' Where do you all plan to go today? / '''Garet:''' We're going to Mt. Aleph with Kraden. / '''Dora:''' Mountain climbing with Kraden, eh?

Alchemy. {{cite video game|title=Golden Sun|developer=Camelot Software Planning|publisher=Nintendo|date=2001-11-11|platform=Game Boy Advance }}</ref> but this coincides with a second raid of the sanctum by Saturos and Menardi, who are now assisted by the adepts [[List of characters in Golden Sun#Felix|Felix]]<ref name="felixmotive">'''Felix:''' I know I've caused you much grief, Jenna.

I've experienced a lot. {{cite video game|title=Golden Sun|developer=Camelot Software Planning|publisher=Nintendo|date=2001-11-11|platform=Game Boy Advance }}</ref> and [[Characters of Golden Sun#Alex|Alex]], and they coerce Isaac into giving them three of the four stars.<ref name="sattythreaten">'''Saturos:''' You heard us... If you wish to save your friends, then give us the Elemental Stars! / '''Menardi:''' Do you accept our terms? / '''Isaac:''' Yes. / '''Kraden:''' No, Isaac!

And if they want her back, they will bring us the Star. {{cite video game|title=Golden Sun|developer=Camelot Software Planning|publisher=Nintendo|date=2001-11-11|platform=Game Boy Advance }}</ref> The guardian of Mt. Aleph, [[List of characters in Golden Sun#The Wise One|the Wise One]], appears before Isaac and Garet and commands them to prevent Saturos' group from achieving their goal of restoring Alchemy to the world with the casting of the Elemental Stars into their respective Elemental Lighthouses situated across Weyard. Alchemy, as the Wise One describes, is a power that can be catastrophic if misused by the people of Weyard, so it should be kept sealed as it is.<ref name="threat">'''The Wise One:''' The world will be exposed to the threat of Alchemy. / '''Garet:''' Alchemy? A threat? / '''The Wise One:''' It can be a dangerous power if it is misused... If the Elemental Stars ignite the flames of the four lighthouses, that power will be released.

''Golden Sun'' climaxes at Venus Lighthouse; Saturos and Menardi activate the lighthouse with the Venus Star, but are again confronted by Isaac's party.<ref name="sattylightsbeacon">'''Saturos:''' I hope you don't think you've finished us off. / '''Mia:''' You may not be finished, but you can barely stand. / '''Menardi:''' Right now, yes...

== Development ==
''Golden Sun'' underwent a development cycle of between twelve and eighteen months by Camelot Software Planning, which is considered a long period of time for the development of a handheld video game,<ref name="development-time">{{cite web|author=IGN Staff|year=2001|title=Import Impressions: Golden Sun|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/097/097263p1.html|publisher=IGN|accessdate=January 6 2007}}</ref> and was described as a "testament" to the positive results a long development cycle can bring to a game.<ref name=ignreview/> It was shown in early, playable form at the Nintendo Spaceworld Expo in Japan on August 2000.<ref name="spaceworld">{{cite web|author=IGN Staff|year=2001|title=Golden Sun Preview|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/135/135255p1.html|publisher=IGN|accessdate=January 6 2007}}</ref> North American previewers received the game a few weeks before the release, and IGN noted that the experience of developing ''[[Shining Force]]'' for Sega helped Camelot develop a gripping RPG for the handheld.<ref name=ign2prev>{{cite web|author=IGN staff|date=2001-11-02|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/099/099610p1.html|title=First Look: US Golden Sun|publisher=gbign.com|accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref>

Originally, Camelot planned to create a single title instead of a series, and in the extremely early stages of their project they had created a game design document for the one ''Golden Sun'' game to be on the [[Nintendo 64]] console. When it became apparent the N64 was to be superseded by the [[Nintendo GameCube]], Camelot shifted their focus to making a game on the handheld [[Game Boy Advance]].<ref name="goldensun64">{{cite web|author=James Mielke|year=2008|title=Previews: We Love Golf! |url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3167178&p=44|publisher=1up|accessdate=April 13 2008}}</ref>

As a handheld title, ''Golden Sun'' was originally going to be a single game, but due to both the hardware limitations of putting the game on a single Game Boy Advance cartridge and the developers' own desire for what they wanted to do with the game, it was expanded to become two successive games, ''Golden Sun'' and ''[[Golden Sun: The Lost Age]]''. Scenario writer Hiroyuki Takahashi and director Shugo Takahashi had previously designed ''[[Shining Force III]]'', where the story involved playing through the perspectives of both the "good" side and the "bad" side of the characters. Thinking that it was an effective way of conveying the full story of a fictional game world, they incorporated elements of this storytelling methodology into the two-game setup of the ''Golden Sun'' series, having the player control the "good guys" in ''Golden Sun'' and members of the antagonistic party in ''The Lost Age''.<ref name="gameplan">{{cite web|author=Louie the Cat|year=2004|title=Rumor: Golden Sun for Gamecube?|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/rumorsArt.cfm?artid=4522|publisher=Nintendo World Report|accessdate=January 7 2007}}</ref>

Complaints about the game generally revolved around the overuse of text dialogue in the numerous cutscenes throughout the game, especially in the prologue, causing the game to get off to a cumbersome start.<ref name=ignreview /> In addition, some faulted ''Golden Sun'' for still relying on the "wander around, get into a random battle, win battle, wander around, random battle, etc." theme in many role-playing games.<ref name="thunder"/> ''Golden Sun'' rates a 9.2/10 on [[MobyGames]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-advance/golden-sun|title=Golden Sun for GBA- Moby Games|publisher=mobygames.com|accessdate=February 2 2007}}</ref> and an 8.5/10 on GameInformer.com (the main complaint being low replay value, it was still titled "GBA's Golden Child").<ref>{{cite web|author=Leeper, Justin|date=2002|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200201/R03.0731.1805.25876.htm|title=Game Informer Online|publisher=gameinformer.com|accessdate=February 1 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070301011655/http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200201/R03.0731.1805.25876.htm |archivedate = March 01, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The game has a 91% ranking on [[Metacritic]].<ref name=mc/>
