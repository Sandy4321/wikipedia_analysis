'''John McAfee''' (born September 18, 1945){{cn|date=November 2012}} is an American computer programmer and founder of [[McAfee]]. He was one of the first people to design [[anti-virus software]] and to develop a [[Computer virus|virus]] scanner.

==Early life==
McAfee was born in [[England]] and raised in [[Salem, Virginia]].<ref name="inventors_inventions">{{cite book|coauthors= |others=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|title=Inventors and Inventions |publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2007|volume=4|page=1030|isbn=0-7614-7767-5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YcPvV893aXgC&pg=PA1030&lpg=PA1030&dq=John+McAfee+grew+up+in+virginia#v=onepage&q=John%20McAfee%20grew%20up%20in%20virginia&f=false}}</ref> He received his [[bachelor's degree]] in mathematics from [[Roanoke College]] in 1967, and he received an honorary doctorate from [[Roanoke College]] in 2008.

== Ventures ==
McAfee was employed as a programmer by [[NASA]]'s [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies|Institute for Space Studies]] in [[New York City]] from 1968 to 1970. From there he went to [[UNIVAC|Univac]] as a software designer and later to [[Xerox]] as an [[operating system]] architect. In 1978 he joined [[Computer Sciences Corporation]] as a software consultant. Later, while employed by [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] in the 1980s, McAfee received a copy of the [[Brain (computer virus)|Pakistani Brain]] computer virus and began developing software to combat viruses.

In 1987 McAfee founded [[McAfee|McAfee Associates]], a computer anti-virus company. He was the first to distribute anti-virus software using the [[shareware]] business model. In 1989, he quit Lockheed and began working full-time at McAfee Associates, which he initially operated from his home in [[Santa Clara, California]]. The company was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1992, and  McAfee resigned from the company in 1994.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cavendish|first=Marshall|title=Inventors and Inventions, Volume 4|year=2007|isbn=0761477675|page=1033|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YcPvV893aXgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Inventors+and+Inventions&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KjSkUMOGD-Oc0AWtuoCADg&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Inventors%20and%20Inventions%20John%20McAfee&f=false}}</ref>  Two years after McAfee Associates went public, McAfee sold his remaining stake in the company.<ref name="latimesblog2"/> Network Associates was formed in 1997 as a merger of McAfee Associates and [[NetScout Systems, Inc.|Network General]]. This company later became [[Network Associates]], a name it retained for seven years until it was renamed McAfee. McAfee remains today as one of the largest anti-virus companies in the world.

Other business ventures that he founded included [[PowWow (chat program)|Tribal Voice]], which developed one of the first instant messaging programs,<ref>{{cite web|last=Pontin |first=Jason |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/Biztech/14405/ |title=From the Editor &#124; MIT Technology Review |publisher=Technologyreview.com |date=2005-05-01 |accessdate=2012-11-15}}</ref> [[PowWow (chat program)|PowWow]].

In August 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that McAfee's personal fortune had declined to $4 million from a peak of $100 million, the effect of the [[Global financial crisis of 2008<U+2013>2009|global financial crisis and recession]] on his investments.<ref name="latimesblog2">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/business/economy/21inequality.html?_r=1&hp |title=Rise of the Super-Rich Hits a Sobering Wall|newspaper = The New York Times |format = article| date = August 21, 2009 | first1=David | last1=Leonhardt | first2=Geraldine | last2=Fabrikant | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref>

Beginning in February 2010, McAfee started a new venture in the field of bacterial [[quorum sensing]]. His company QuorumEx<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quorumex.com/ |title=Quorum sensing inhibitor agents from the jungles and savannas of Belize |publisher=QuorumEx.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-15}}</ref> is headquartered in [[Belize]] and is working towards producing commercial all natural [[antibiotics]] based on anti-quorum sensing technology.<ref name="fast-company">{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/node/1615167/print|title=Plagued by Lawsuits, McAfee Founder Hunts for Cures in Belize|publisher=Fast Company|format=article|date= May 1, 2010}}</ref><ref name="gizmodo1">{{cite |url=http://gizmodo.com/5958877 |title=Secrets, Schemes, and Lots of Guns: Inside John McAfee<U+2019>s Heart of Darkness |author= Jeff Wise |publisher=[[Gizmodo]] |date=8 November 2012}}</ref>

==Personal life==
McAfee teaches [[yoga]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aryoga.com/McAfee/AYC0309.htm |title=Arkansas Yoga Center - John McAfee Workshop 2002 |publisher=Aryoga.com |date=2002-03-09 |accessdate=2012-11-15}}</ref> and has written several books about yoga.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/s/?search-alias=stripbooks&field-author-exact=John%20McAfee |title=John McAfee: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-15}}</ref>

In a 2012 article in ''Mensa Bulletin'', the magazine of [[American Mensa]], he stated that being the developer of the first commercial anti-virus program has made him "the most popular hacking target", adding "Hackers see hacking me as a badge of honor." He added that for his own security he has other people buy his computer equipment for him, uses pseudonyms for setting up computers and logging in, and changes his IP address several times a day.<ref>"The M Files" (interview feature), ''Mensa Bulletin'', January 2012, p. 21</ref>

==Legal problems==
On May 2, 2012, McAfee's property in [[Orange Walk Town]], [[Belize]], was raided by the [[Gang Suppression Unit]]. A GSU press release stated that he was arrested for unlicensed drug manufacturing and possession of an unlicensed weapon. McAfee was allegedly in the presence of his 17-year-old Belizean girlfriend.<ref>
