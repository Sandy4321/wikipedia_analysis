'''Robin Becker''' (born [[1951]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[poet]], critic, feminist, and professor.  She was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and is author of seven collections of poetry, most recently, The Horse Fair ([[University of Pittsburgh Press]], 2000). Her  ''All-American Girl'' (University of Pittsburgh Press), won the 1996 Lambda Literary Award in Poetry. Becker earned a B.A. in 1973 and an M.A. from [[Boston University]] in 1976. She resides in [[Boalsburg, Pennsylvania]] and spends her summers on the North Fork of [[Long Island]].

==Teaching Career==
Becker taught for seventeen years at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and currently and is Associate Professor of English and Women's Studies at [[Pennsylvania State University]],<ref>[http://forum.wgbh.org/lecture/meet-poet-robin-becker WGBH Forum Network: Meet the Poet: Robin Becker]</ref>  where she has taught since 1993.<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=431 Poetry Foundation > Robin Becker (1951 -- )]</ref> She also teaches workshops such as those at the Summer Program Poetry Workshops at [[The Fine Arts Center]] in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]].

== Literary Influences & Praise ==
<U+201C>Becker grew up listening to her grandmother<U+2019>s stories, learning from her the nuances of storytelling and her family<U+2019>s history in Ukraine. Becker was also greatly influenced by the women writers whose poetry was available in the 1970s, including [[Adrienne Rich]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Maxine Kumin]], [[Denise Levertov]], and [[Susan Griffin]]. <U+201C><ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=431 Poetry Foundation > Robin Becker (1951 -- )]</ref>

Her first two books were published by [[Alice James Books]], the first in 1977, ''Personal Effects'' (a three-poet anthology,  including Robin Becker, Helena Minton and Marilyn Zuckerman), which makes her one of the earliest cooperative members of the press, which was founded in 1973,<ref>[http://www.alicejamesbooks.org/about_ajb.html Alice James Books > About Us]</ref> <ref>[http://www.alicejamesbooks.org/personal_effects.html Alice James Books > ''Personal Effects'' Book Page]</ref> so it seems fitting that [[Ed Ochester]] has said that "Robin is one of the most varied of the poets on the Pitt list in her style and subject matter--and the foremost feminist poet of her generation.<U+201D><ref>[http://thebestamericanpoetry.typepad.com/the_best_american_poetry/2009/04/ed-.html ''The Washington Post'' > ''Poet<U+2019>s Choice'' > By Robert Pinsky > Sunday, July 16, 2006]</ref>

In her biography of Robin Becker, Heidi Ogrodnek writes, <U+201C>She is known for her work in Lesbian and Gay studies and served as visiting scholar at the Center for Lesbian and Gay studies at the CUNY in 1998. She has said, 'Feminist scholarship and Gay and Lesbian poetry have provided me with the tools with which to work.' Her collections of poetry develop precise, delicate imagery and<U+2026> depict her own transition from girlhood to womanhood<U+2026> Maxine Kumin has also been a tremendous inspiration to Becker...[she] learned that 'woman poets could celebrate their lives and not position themselves as victims in every story.'
