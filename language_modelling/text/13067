'''Maureen "Mo" Butcher''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Edna Dor<U+00E9>]] between 1988 and 1990.

==Creation and development==
1988 was a year of change on-screen in ''EastEnders''.<ref name="first10years">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-37057-2}}</ref> Since the show's inception in 1985 and up until 1988, one of the soap's main focal points, [[The Queen Victoria]] (The Vic) [[public house]], had been inhabited by the Watts family; however, actors [[Leslie Grantham]] and [[Anita Dobson]] who played landlords [[Den Watts|Den]] and [[Angie Watts]] resigned in 1988, meaning the soap's bosses had to find a new family to inhabit the Vic.<ref name="first10years"/> [[Pat Evans|Pat Wicks]] ([[Pam St Clement]]) and her boyfriend [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (entertainer)|Mike Reid]]) were instilled as the new landlords, and along with Frank came his family, including his mother Mo (Edna Dore), who moved to [[Walford]] in September.<ref name="first10years"/>

Mo was portrayed as a battle-axe.<ref name="EEHandbook">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|The EastEnders Handbook]] |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|id=ISBN 0685529576}}</ref> Author Hilary Kingsley has described Mo as a "tough, interfering busybody with a will of iron and a face of stone [...] To her grandchildren she was always indulgent, but to Frank she was always the boss, a woman with a whim or iron."<ref name="EEHandbook"/> Kingsley surmised that "only slowly did Walford begin to see a softer side to hard bitten old Mo".<ref name="EEHandbook"/> Kingsley described Mo as a woman who sought status, suggesting that she wished to be "Queen Bee" when she moved to Walford and regarded Frank's new wife Pat as "nothing more than a pushy interloper".<ref name="EEHandbook"/> Initial storylines centred upon clashes between Pat and Mo, with Frank trying to find a compromise between the bickering women in his life. Kingsley has commented that "gradually some sort of compromise was worked out and slowly Mo became more human."<ref name="EEHandbook"/>

In 1990, a topical storyline was aired in which Mo was given [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name="first10years"/> During the year, Mo was shown to grown increasingly more forgetful, and after tests, Frank was informed that Mo was suffering with dementia. The storyline was scripted to show the effect on the family when a parent/loved one suffers from Alzheiner's.<ref name="first10years"/> By November that year, Mo was in advanced stages of mental deterioration. It was at this stage that the character was written out of ''EastEnders'', Edna Dore having decided to end her contract.<ref name="first10years"/> On-screen, Mo was sent to live with her daughter in Colchester, having convinced herself that Frank wanted to kill her. Writer [[Colin Brake]] has suggested that the storyline had to be curtailed earlier than they would have liked due to Dore's desire to leave.<ref name="first10years"/>

Commenting on her time in the soap and reasons for her departure in 1999, Dore said, "I shall always be grateful to EastEnders. It gave me recognition. It was a marvellous opportunity to be known everywhere, although it totally changes your life. For a while I couldn't even go shopping without being stopped. But compared with the theatre or film it was lacking in job satisfaction because it was so quick. I did it for a couple of years. I didn't want to stay so long that I wouldn't be considered for other parts."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/WEEKEND+TV%3a+Edna+is+so+young+at+heart%3b+Fame+and+fortune+has+come+late...-a060253256|title=Edna is so young at heart.|publisher=''Coventry Evening Telegraph''|date=1999-07-31 |accessdate=2011-04-06}}</ref>

Mo was killed off-screen in 1992, succumbing to Alzheimer's; her death was confirmed on-screen in the New Year's Eve episode of 1992. Dore was at a New Year's Eve part when she discovered her character's fate from a friend. She commented in 2001, "I was at a New Year's Eve party when someone came up to me and said, 'Have you seen, you've been killed off?' And I heaved a sigh of relief and had another drink. Still I can't complain. I had a good time at ''EastEnders'' and the one advantage of having been in a soap is that I get far better paid for my roles now."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/WEEKEND+TV%3a+Is+there+life+outside+the+soap+bowl%3f-a079327404|title=Is there life outside the soap bowl?|publisher=''Coventry Evening Telegraph''|date=2001-10-20 |accessdate=2011-04-06}}</ref>
 
==Storylines==
Mo was born in [[Walthamstow]]. During her teenage years she married a man, Chike Butcher, who had worked for [[London Transport]] since he had left school.  Chike was promoted to a transport inspector at the age of forty-five, Mo felt she had achieved status. They had two children, Frank and [[Joan Garwood|Joan]]. Following Chike's death, Mo never remarried.

Mo arrives in [[Albert Square]] in September 1988 to be near her family. She disapproves of the way he is raising his teenage children [[Ricky Butcher|Ricky]] and [[Diane Butcher|Diane]] and immediately clashes with his fianc<U+00E9>e [[Pat Evans|Pat Wicks]], bringing up her past reputation as a [[prostitute]] and threatening to put a halt to their impending marriage. During her time in [[Walford]] Mo has an array of jobs; she first works in the kitchens of [[The Queen Victoria]], then on [[Arthur Fowler]]'s fruit and veg stall and then in [[Ali Osman]]'s caf<U+00E9>. However all her jobs come to an end due to her interference, causing her employers no end of grief.

Fiercely loyal to her family, Mo sticks by her son through his financial woes and tries her best to help him out by offering Frank her late husband Chike's life insurance money. She is shown to be extremely fond of her favourite grandchild [[Janine Butcher|Janine]] and takes a hand in persuading Frank to bring her to Walford to live with him. However despite being protective and doting on her family Mo is not blinkered to their faults, even in a rare moment supporting Pat in her decision to put Janine in therapy when her behaviour becomes out of control. Mo eventually warms to Pat, seeing that Frank does love her, and arranges for them to be married in great East End style, complete with a horse and carriage, [[Pearly Kings]], a street party and jellied eels.

Her busybody attitude results in few friendships in Walford for Mo, but she becomes close to [[Marge Green]], despite belittling her. Together they participate in the Walford [[Brownies (Girl Guides)|Brownies]], but Mo (a Brown Owl) is sacked for lying about her age. She also takes on the local council over the proposed closure of the [[community centre]].

In 1990, she became increasingly forgetful, and was eventually diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]] after flooding the B&B and setting fire to the house. Frank felt unable to look after her, and sent her to live with his sister Joan, who looked after Mo in [[Colchester]] until she died on New Year's Eve 1992.

After Frank died in 2008, his solicitor read the will in the Vic and presented [[Janine Evans|Janine]] with Mo's diary from 1990,  which was left to her as per Frank's instructions.
== Reception ==
Edna Dore's portrayal of Mo's descent into Alzheimer's has been described as "deeply moving" by John Millar of the ''[[Daily Record]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fab+idea+was+just+flogged+to+death.-a061261653|title=Fab idea was just flogged to death|publisher=''Daily Record''|date=1996-05-11 |accessdate=2011-04-06}}</ref> Former executive producer of ''EastEnders'', [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]], has suggested that Mo suffering from Alzheimer's in 1990 gave people permission to talk about an illness "that had been almost too distressing to discuss in public before."<ref name="EEHandbook"/> He alleged that viewers infromed him that ''EastEnders'' had given them a shorthand "like Mo" to discuss Alzheimer's.<ref name="EEHandbook"/> 

According to writer Colin Brake, the storyline involving Mo and the unruly Brownies was intended to be fun, but references to Brownies behaving badly caused great offence to the Brownie movement, and an official complaint was made and upheld. The broadcasting commission said the ''EastEnders'' Brownie episodes "came near to parody," were unfair to the Brownies and harmed the [[Girl Guides]]' image.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/471606831.html?dids=471606831:471606831&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+12%2C+1990&author=Michael+Hanlon+Toronto+Star&pub=Toronto+Star&desc=Poll+tax+blamed+for+pushing+Britons+into+debt&pqatl=google|title=Poll tax blamed for pushing Britons into debt|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|date=12 March 1990|accessdate=13 August 2009}}</ref> The BBC had to make a public apology for the misinterpretation of the movement.<ref name="first10years"/> Brake has suggested that the mishap was a "salutary lesson to those [...] in the script department to be very vigilant in ensuring, as far as possible, that no group or individual was offended by an unintentional slight in a script."<ref name="first10years"/>
