'''Fossil Lake''' (designated by the [[Bureau of Land Management]] as '''Fossil Lake Area of Critical Environmental Concern''') is a dry lakebed in the remote [[High Desert (Oregon)|high desert]] country of northern [[Lake County, Oregon|Lake County]] in the [[United States|U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]].  During the [[Pleistocene]] epoch, Fossil Lake and the surrounding basin were covered by an ancient lake.  Numerous animals used the lake resources.  Over time, the remains of many of these animals became fossilized in the lake sediments.  As a result, Fossil Lake has been an important site for fossil collection and scientific study for well over a century.  Over the years, [[Paleontology|paleontologists]] have found the fossil remains of numerous [[mammal]]s as well as [[bird]] and [[fish]] species there. Some of these fossils are 2&nbsp;million years old.  

== Geography and geology ==

Fossil Lake is located at the northeastern corner of the Christmas Valley basin in south-central Oregon.  The bedrock beneath the area was created by [[basalt]] flows laid down during the [[Pliocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] epochs. After a period of intense faulting during the middle Pleistocene, a large basin area was created by [[erosion]] and [[sedimentation]].  This basin filled with water during the wet climatic periods of the Pleistocene and post-Pleistocene to a depth of {{convert|200|ft|m}}.  Over the past 3,200 years, the surface water in the Christmas Valley basin including Fossil Lake has completely dried up, leaving a high-desert environment.<ref name="SDA">[http://www.blm.gov/or/resources/recreation/files/brochures/Sand%20Dunes.pdf Lost Forest Research Natural Area] (PDF), ''Christmas Valley Sand Dunes Area of Critical Environmental Concern'', Lakeview District, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Lakeview, Oregon, 2005.</ref><ref name="WH1">Moir, William H., Jerry F.

The lakebed at Fossil Lake was formed during the post-Pleistocene period from lake sediments and alluvial materials.  Pumice sands from [[Mount Mazama]] and [[Newberry Crater]] also appear in the surface soils throughout the Fossil Lake area.  The surface soils are underlain by a hard calcium carbonate [[Caliche (mineral)|caliche]] layer several inches thick.  This subsurface caliche layer is impervious to water drainage and is seldom penetrated by roots.  This unique surface structure has helped the [[ponderosa pine]]s in nearby [[Lost Forest Research Natural Area]] survive in the high-desert environment.<ref name="WH1"/><ref name="KLC">Chadwick, Kristen L. and Andris Eglitis, [http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsbdev2_026127.pdf ''Health Assessment of the Lost Forest Research Natural Area''] (PDF), Central Oregon Service Center for Insects and Diseases, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Bend, Oregon, February 2007, pp. 1<U+2013>2.</ref>

In 1877, there were still two small seasonal ponds at the Fossil Lake site surrounded by a large dry lakebed.  The two ponds were called the ''Fossil Lakes''.  Since then, both ponds have dried up completely.  In addition, the site name is now singular and only applies to the western dry-pond area.<ref name="LSM">McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, "Fossil Lake", ''Oregon Geographic Names'' (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 376.</ref>  

Today, the Fossil Lake site is a dry lakebed above fossil-bearing deposits in the Christmas Valley basin.  The area is generally flat with gentle swales.  The elevation of the lakebed is {{convert|4295|ft|m}} above sea level.  There are large moving [[Christmas Valley Sand Dunes|sand dunes]] east of the lakebed.  These dunes are made up of [[Lacustrine plain|lacustrine]] sediments, [[Aeolian processes|Aeolian]] deposits, and [[alluvial]] materials with large amounts of volcanic [[pumice]] and [[Volcanic ash|ash]] mixed into fine sand that have been blown off the surface of Fossil Lake.<ref name="KLC"/><ref name="BLM">[http://www.blm.gov/or/plans/files/LakeviewRMP/2003RMP.htm "Areas of Critical Environmental Concern"], ''Proposed Lakeview Resource Management Plan and Final Environmental Impact Statement'', Lakeview District,  Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Lakeview, Oregon, January 2003, pp. 2.65<U+2013>2.67.</ref>

== History ==

The first settlers arrived in the Christmas Lake Valley around 1865.<ref name="WH2">Moir, William H., Jerry F. Franklin, and Chris Maser, [http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/publications/pnw_1972_franklin001/Supplements/FRNA_Supp.No.3_LostForest_LF_1_17.pdf "History of Disturbance"] (PDF), ''Lost Forest Research Natural Area'', Pacific Northwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, United States Forest Service, Department of Agriculture, Portland, Oregon, 1973, p. 15.</ref>  In June 1877, [[John Whiteaker]] (a former governor of Oregon) visited the Christmas Valley basin.  During the trip, Whiteaker explored the Fossil Lake area, where he found a large dry lakebed with two small [[alkali]] ponds in low spots.  Whiteaker named the ponds the ''Fossil Lakes''.  In addition, he found numerous exposed fossils throughout the area, including [[elephant]], [[camel]], [[horse]], and [[elk]] fossils, as well as fossils from animals that Whiteaker could not identify.  He noted that horse and bird fossils were particularly plentiful.  He also found ancient human artifacts.  Whiteaker reported that fossils were scattered across a large swath of desert running from southwest to northeast.  He estimated that the fossil beds were {{convert|1|mi|km}} wide and over {{convert|4|mi|km}} long.  After his trip, Whiteaker delivered his fossils to [[Thomas Condon]], a well-known paleontologist and professor at the [[University of Oregon]].<ref name="LSM"/><ref>J. W. (John Whiteaker), [http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn84022653/1877-09-29/ed-1/seq-3/#date1=09%2F29%2F1877&index=0&date2=09%2F29%2F1877&words=bed+BEDS+fossil+FOSSIL+Fossil+fossils&searchType=advanced&sequence=0&lccn=sn84022653&proxdistance=5&rows=20&ortext=%22Fossil+Beds%22&proxtext=&phrasetext=&andtext=&dateFilterType=range&page=1 "A Trip to the Fossil Beds"], ''Eugene City Guard'', Eugene, Oregon, 29 September 1877, p. 3.</ref>

Later that year, Whiteaker's son, J.C. Whiteaker, returned to Fossil Lake with professor Condon.  The goal of this second expedition was to more carefully examine and record the numerous fossils scattered around the Fossil Lake site.  Condon's discoveries at Fossil Lake attracted the attention of other well-known paleontologists.<ref name="LSM"/><ref>Mack, Tony, [http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&dat=19930426&id=1cA9AAAAIBAJ&sjid=g4YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5388,1686620 "Thomas Condon: Oregon's Grand Old Fossil Man"], ''Horizons'' insert, ''The Bulletin'', Bend, Oregon, 26 April 1993, pp. 5<U+2013>6.</ref><ref name="PB">Brogan, Phil F., ''East of the Cascades'', Binfords and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1965, pp. 7<U+2013>8.</ref><ref name="RLH">Hatton, Raymond L., High Desert of Central Oregon, Binford and Mort, Caldwell, Idaho, 1977, pp. 126<U+2013>139.</ref>  

After the first site surveys in 1877, numerous paleontologists have visited Fossil Lake to collect fossils and conduct research.<ref name="SDA"/>   In 1879, Professor [[Edward D. Cope]] of the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University|Philadelphia Academy of Sciences]] visited Condon at the University of Oregon and then went to Fossil Lake to collect fossils.<ref name="PB"/><ref>"Southern Oregon", ''The Oregonian'', Portland, Oregon, 5 November 1879, p. 1.</ref><ref name="RLH"/>  Other paleontologists who collected at Fossil Lake during the latter part of the 19th&nbsp;century include [[Othniel Charles Marsh|O. C. Marsh]] of [[Yale University]]; [[Charles Hazelius Sternberg|Charles H. Sternberg]], an author and amateur paleontologist; Jacob L. Wortman of the [[American Museum Of Natural History]]; and [[Robert Wilson Shufeldt|Robert W. Shufeldt]], curator of the [[National Museum of Health and Medicine|Army Medical Museum]].  Both Sternberg and Wortman led expeditions that collected for professor Cope.  The [[Smithsonian Institution]] also began research at Fossil Lake in the late 1800s.  During this period, local settlers reported that fossils were often removed by the wagon load.<ref name="BLM"/><ref name="PB"/><ref>Ashwill, Melvin S., [http://www.oregongeology.org/pubs/og/OGv49n12.pdf "Paleontology in Oregon: Workers of the Past"] (PDF), ''Oregon Geology'', Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, Portland, Oregon, December 1987, pp. 147<U+2013>149.</ref><ref>Brogan, Phil F., "Fossil Lake Story Retold", ''The Sunday Oregonian'', Portland, Oregon, 7 March 1954, p. 35.</ref>

After 1906, the number of [[Homestead Act|homesteads]] in the Christmas Valley basin began to increase.  In that year, a post office was opened at ''Cliff'', just north of Fossil Lake.  Settlers used the Fossil Lake area for grazing sheep, cattle, and horses.  Due to the harsh high-desert conditions, most of the settlers had abandoned their [[Homestead (buildings)|farms]] by 1920. That was the year the Cliff post office was closed.  A prolonged drought in the 1920s and 1930s put an end to dry farming in the region.<ref name="WH2"/><ref>McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, "Cliff", ''Oregon Geographic Names'' (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 209.</ref><ref>Waring, Gerald A., [http://pubs.usgs.gov/wsp/0220/report.pdf "Christmas Lake Valley"] (PDF), ''Geology and Water Resources of a Portion of South-Central Oregon'', Water-Supply Paper 22O, United States Geological Survey, United States Department of Interior, Washington, District of Columbia, 1908, pp. 59<U+2013>61.</ref>  

In 1977, the Bureau of Land Management placed a temporary ban on vehicles in the Fossil Lake area.  The restriction applied to {{convert|6560|acre|ha}} around the dry lakebed.  In 1979, the Bureau of Land Management made the vehicle ban permanent.<ref name="SDA"/><ref name="BIS"/><ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19791009&id=yABWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=E-IDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2947,7303265 "Fossil Lake Area Closed to Vehicles Permanently"], ''Eugene Register-Guard'', Eugene, Oregon, 9 October 1979, p. B1.</ref>  In 1983, the Bureau of Land Management joined Fossil Lake, the neighboring Lost Forest Research Natural Area, and the [[Christmas Valley Sand Dunes]] into a single [[Area of Critical Environmental Concern]].  Collecting fossils in the Fossil Lake Area of Critical Environmental Concern without a permit from the Bureau of Land Management is prohibited.<ref name="SDA"/><ref name="KLC"/>

In early 1990s, the Bureau of Land Management began working with the [[South Dakota School of Mines]] to salvage fossils and conduct paleontological research at Fossil Lake.  This collaboration lasted well over a decade.  The fossils collected during that project are housed at the South Dakota School of Mines campus in [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]], [[South Dakota]].<ref name="BLM"/>

== Fossils ==

The fossil-bearing deposits at Fossil Lake cover at least {{convert|10000|acre|ha}}.  Over the years, there have been numerous expeditions to collect fossils at the Fossil Lake site.  The site has produced more [[Holocene]] fossils than any other location in the world except the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] in [[California]].<ref name="BLM"/>  Fossil discoveries have included at least 23 mammal species, 74 bird species, 7 fish species, and 11 mollusk species.  Some of the large mammal fossils found at the site include [[Columbian mammoth]]s, [[giant ground sloths]], [[dire wolves]], [[giant beaver]]s, [[Bison antiquus|pre-historic bison]], three species of camels, several horses species, [[peccary]], and an extinct bear.  Bird fossils include [[flamingo]]s, [[pelican]]s, and [[swan]]s, and large [[eagle]] species.  Fish fossils include [[tui chub]] and several [[salmon]] species.  Two-thirds of the fossil species collected at Fossil Lake are extinct.<ref name="SDA"/><ref name="BIS"/><ref name="BLM"/><ref>Brogan, Phil F., "Wind Whips Fossil bed", ''The Sunday Oregonian'', Portland, Oregon, 17 May 1970, p. RE14.</ref>

[[File:Mammuthus columbi.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Mammoths once lived around Fossil Lake]]
The extent of the fossil beds at the Fossil Lake site is still unknown.  However, there are specific rock layers for different periods of time, each containing fossils of different animals.  The fossil deposits from the Holocene epoch are between 8,000 abd 50,000&nbsp;years old.  There are also Fossil Lake artifacts that indicate that humans may have hunted in this area during the latter part of this period.  Some of the animals that were hunted may have been large mammals that are now extinct.  The oldest fossils from the site date back to the Pleistocene epoch.  These fossils are up to 2&nbsp;million years old.<ref name="BIS"/><ref name="BLM"/>

The Bureau of Land Management has identified several environmental concerns with regard to the Fossil Lake site.  First, the fossil deposits extend beyond the boundary of the existing restricted area.  As a result, there is a risk that vehicles or grazing livestock may damage unprotected fossils.  Second, illegal fossil collecting is a potential problem.  Finally, loose surface sediments at Fossil Lake continue to erode, exposing new fossils each year.  When fossils are first exposed, they are often found as articulated skeletons.  However, the remains are quickly scattered due to wind action.  Sandy sediments carried by the wind also cause rapid weathering once the fossils are exposed.  As a result, scientists try to collect the newly exposed fossils as soon as possible.<ref name="BLM"/>

Today, large fossil collections from the Fossil Lake site are maintained by the University of Oregon, the Smithsonian Institution, the South Dakota School of Mines, the [[University of California at Los Angeles]], and the [[University of California at Berkley]].<ref name="BLM"/><ref name="RLH"/><ref>[http://natural-history.uoregon.edu/collections/condon-fossil-collection "Condon Fossil Collection"], Museum of Natural and Cultural History, University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, 5 August 2014.</ref>

== Environment ==

[[File:Fossil Lake landscape, Lake County, Oregon.JPG|right|thumb|250px|High desert landscape at Fossil Lake]]
Based on [[National Weather Service]] data recorded at Cliff between 1908 and 1916 and other nearby weather reporting stations, the mean annual temperature in the Fossil Lake area is {{convert|43|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|0|}}.  The hottest and driest months are July and August, with a peak average temperature of {{convert|63|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|0|}}.  The coldest months are December and January.  The average daily temperature in December is {{convert|30|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|0|}} and {{convert|28|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|0|}} in January.  The mean annual [[precipitation]] at Fossil Lake is {{convert|8.7|in|cm}} per year.  The wettest months are December and January, with a smaller peak period in May and June.  However, weather patterns in this area are very erratic.  For example, there was an extremely severe drought throughout the 1920s and early 1930s.<ref name="WH1"/>

The Fossil Lake area supports a plant community dominated by [[Artemisia tridentata|big sagebrush]], [[Artemisia arbuscula|low sagebrush]], [[Artemisia cana|silver sagebrush]], [[Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus|green rabbitbrush]] (also called yellow rabbitbrush), [[Ericameria nauseosa|rubber rabbitbrush]], and [[Sarcobatus|greasewood]].  There are a number of perennial grasses common in the Fossil Lake area, including [[Poa secunda|Sandberg bluegrass]], [[Hesperostipa comata|needle-and-thread grass]], [[Oryzopsis hymenoides|Indian ricegrass]], [[Leymus triticoides|creeping wildrye]], and invasive [[Bromus tectorum|cheatgrass]].  Perennial flowering plants found in the Fossil Lake area include [[Leptodactylon pungens|prickly-phlox]], [[Psoralidium lanceolatum|lemon scrufpea]] [[Eriophyllum lanatum|common wooly sunflower]], and [[Townsendia|Townsend daisy]], and [[Grayia spinosa|spiny hopsage]].<ref>[http://www.blm.gov/or/districts/lakeview/plans/files/Sand_Dunes_Road_EA_FONSI.pdf "Sand Dunes Road Maintenance and Re-Alignment OR-L050-2009-0063-EA"] (PDF), ''Notice of Availability Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Impact'', Lakeview Resource Area, Bureau of land Management, United States Department of Interior, Lakeview, Oregon, 17 August 2009, pp. 6<U+2013>7.</ref><ref>Moir, William H., Jerry F.
