===Reception===
Critics were positive towards the song. In the ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' review of the album, critic David Browne wrote: "Songs like 'In My Place' and 'Warning Sign' marry lyrics imbued with deep regret and mistakes (<nowiki>''</nowiki>...You were an island / And I passed you by<nowiki>''</nowiki> in the touching latter song) with lyrical melodies and guitar hooks that twinkle and sparkle."<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Browne|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,345715,00.html|title=A Rush of Blood to the Head - Music Review|accessdate=2008-09-02|date=2002-09-02|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=''ew.com''}}</ref> Adrien Begrand of [[PopMatters]] wrote: "When the shimmering, pretty lead-off single 'In My Place' represents the album<U+2019>s weakest moment, you know you<U+2019>ve got something extraordinary. Currently storming the charts a la 'Yellow', 'In My Place' is another surprisingly simple song, carried by Jon Buckland<U+2019>s chiming guitar and Chris Martin<U+2019>s heartfelt vocals. It really shouldn<U+2019>t amount to much, but Coldplay make it work very well. When Martin sings, "Please, please, please/Come back and sing to me," he totally sells it, and you buy it. And why not?
