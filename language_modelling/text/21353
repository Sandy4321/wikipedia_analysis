The '''''Second Manifesto''''' was a [[1904]] declaration made by [[Joseph F. Smith]], the [[President of the Church|president]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in which Smith confirmed that the church was opposed to [[plural marriage]] and set down the principle that those entering into or solemnizing plural marriages would be excommunicated from the church.<ref name = IR>[http://search.ldslibrary.com/article/view/1547628#1547641 "Official Statement by President Joseph F. Smith"], ''[[Improvement Era]]'' '''7''':545<U+2013>546 (Apr. 1904).</ref>

==Background==
In [[1890]], church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] had issued the initial [[1890 Manifesto|Manifesto]], in which he renounced the LDS Church's long-standing practice of plural marriage. However, after the Manifesto, it became clear that a number of church members, including members of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], were continuing to enter into or solemnize [[polygamy|polygamous marriages]].<ref>Kenneth Cannon II, [http://www.sunstoneonline.com/magazine/searchable/mag-text.asp?MagID=37 "After the Manifesto: Mormon Polygamy, 1890<U+2013>1906"], ''[[Sunstone Magazine|Sunstone]]'', Jan.<U+2013>Apr. 1983, p. 27.</ref><ref>D.

Carmon Hardy (1992). ''Solemn Covenant: The Mormon Polygamous Passage'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press).</ref> Smith issued the ''Second Manifesto'' near the beginning of the [[Reed Smoot hearings]], [[United States Congress]]ional hearings into whether LDS Church [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] [[Reed Smoot]] should be permitted to sit as a [[United States Senator]] from [[Utah]]; Smoot's opponents alleged that the LDS Church hierarchy's continued tolerance or encouragement of plural marriage should exclude Smoot from sitting in the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

==Announcement==
[[Image:ldspresidentjosephfsmith.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Joseph F. Smith, author of the ''Second Manifesto'']]
The ''Second Manifesto'' was announced at the [[General conference (Latter Day Saints)|general conference]] of the church held on [[April 6]], [[1904]]. At a public meeting, Smith annouced that he would like to read an "official statement" that he had prepared so that his words "may not be misunderstood or misquoted". Smith read:

<blockquote>
Inasmuch as there are numerous reports in circulation that plural marriages have been entered into, contrary to the official declaration of President Woodruff of September 24, 1890, commonly called the manifesto, which was issued by President Woodruff, and adopted by the Church at its general conference, October 6, 1890, which forbade any marriages violative of the law of the land, I, Joseph F. Smith, President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, hereby affirm and declare that no such marriages have been solemnized with the sanction, consent, or knowledge of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

And I hereby announce that all such marriages are prohibited, and if any officer or member of the Church shall assume to solemnize or enter into any such marriage, he will be deemed in transgression against the Church, and will be liable to be dealt with according to the rules and regulations thereof and excommunicated therefrom.
<br />

<br />President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<ref name = CR>[http://search.ldslibrary.com/article/view/274597 ''Conference Report''], April 1904, p. 97.</ref>
</blockquote>

[[Francis M. Lyman]], [[president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], then presented the following resolution of endorsement, which was seconded by [[B.H. Roberts]] and [[Common consent|accepted]] unanimously by those in attendance at the conference:

<blockquote>
Resolved that we, the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in General Conference assembled, hereby approve and endorse the statement and declaration of President Joseph F. Smith just made to this Conference concerning plural marriages, and will support the courts of the Church in the enforcement thereof.<ref name = CR/>
</blockquote>

Smith's official statement was later published in the ''[[Improvement Era]]'', an official magazine of the church.<ref name = IR/>

==Aftermath==
A number of church leaders were opposed to the enforcement of the ''Second Manifesto'', including [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostles]] [[John W. Taylor (Mormon)|John W. Taylor]] and [[Matthias F. Cowley]]. As a result of their opposition, both were expelled from the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in [[1906]], and in [[1911]] Taylor was excommunicated for continued opposition.<ref>Victor W. Jorgensen & B. Carmon Hardy, "The Taylor<U+2013>Cowley Affair and the Watershed of Mormon History", ''Utah Historical Quarterly'' '''48''':4 (1980).</ref>

As the church began to excommunicate those who continued to enter into plural marriages, some of those individuals began the [[Mormon fundamentalist]] movement.

Unlike the [[1890 Manifesto]], the LDS Church has not canonized the ''Second Manifesto'', but it nevertheless remains an accurate description of the church's attitude towards its members that enter into or solemnize polygamous marriages.
