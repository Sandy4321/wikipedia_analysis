Various '''Franco-Indian alliances''' were formed between France and Indian polities between the 18th century to the ascent of [[Napoleon]]. Following the alliances of [[Joseph Fran<U+00E7>ois Dupleix|Dupleix]], a formal alliance was formed between by [[Louis XVI]]'s France during the late 18th century in an attempt to oust [[Great Britain]] from the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Later, numerous proposals of alliance were made by [[Tipu Sultan]], leading to the dispatch of a French fleet of volunteers to help him, and even motivating an effort by [[Napoleon]] to make a junction with India, through the 1798 [[Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt|Campaign of Egypt]].

==Early French involvement==

In the 17th century [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Bernier]] (1625&ndash;1688), a [[French people|French]] [[physician]] and traveler, became for 12 years the personal physician of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Aurangzeb]].

In the early 18th century, France was actively involved in the powerplay in [[India]]. The French General [[Joseph Fran<U+00E7>ois Dupleix|Dupleix]] was allied to [[Murzapha Jung]] in the [[Deccan]], and [[Chanda Sahib]] in the [[Carnatic Wars]], in the conflict against [[Robert Clive]]. These relationships were beneficial to the French, and French allies gifted areas such as the [[Alamparai Fort]] in return for the services provided by the French against the British. 

The French succeeded in the 1746 [[Battle of Madras]], and the French and Indians fought together and vanquished [[Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan|Anwaruddin]] in 1749, but failed in the [[Battle of Arcot]] in 1751 and finally surrendered in 1752.<ref>''Cambridge Ilustrated Atlas of Warfare'', p.160</ref> The French again had a success at the capture of [[Fort St. David]] in 1758 under [[Thomas Arthur, comte de Lally|Lally]], but were finally defeated at [[Masulipatam]] (1759) and [[Wandewash]] (1760).<ref>''Cambridge Ilustrated Atlas of Warfare'', p.160</ref>

==Alliance of Louis XVI==
[[File:Madhu Rao Narayan the Maratha Peshwa with Nana Fadnavis and attendants Poona 1792 by James Wales.jpg|thumb|The [[Maratha]] [[Peshwa]] [[Madhu Rao Narayan]] formed an alliance with [[Louis XVI]] in 1782. Here in [[Poona]], 1792.]]
French had lost preeminence in India with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], although five trading posts were being maintained there, leaving opportunities for disputes and power-play with [[Great Britain]].<ref>[http://www.tigerandthistle.net/tipu315.htm The National Galleries of Scotland]</ref> France was successful in supporting the [[American War of Independence]] in 1776, and wished to expel the British from India as well.<ref>[http://www.tigerandthistle.net/tipu315.htm The National Galleries of Scotland]</ref>

In 1782, [[Louis XVI]] sealed an alliance with the [[Peshwa]] [[Madhavrao II|Madhu Rao Narayan]]. As a consequence [[Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau|Bussy]] moved his troops to Ile de France ([[Mauritius]]) and later contributed to the French effort in India in 1783.<ref>[http://www.tigerandthistle.net/tipu315.htm The National Galleries of Scotland]</ref><ref>''The influence of sea power upon history, 1660-1783'' by Alfred Thayer Mahan p.461 [http://books.google.com/books?id=nc7H1eQiArQC&pg=PA461]</ref> [[Pierre Andr<U+00E9> de Suffren de Saint Tropez|Suffren]] became the ally of [[Hyder Ali]] in the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]] against British rule in India, in 1782-1783, fighting the British fleet on the coasts of India and [[Ceylon]].<ref>[http://historyproject.ucdavis.edu/ic/standard/5.00/5.3_1.00/13161.html The History Project, University of California]</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=Fk_RaalNQAQC&pg=PA183 ''Britain as a military power, 1688-1815'' by Jeremy Black, p]</ref> 

Between February 1782 until June 1783, Suffren fought the English admiral [[Sir Edward Hughes]], and collaborated with the rulers of Mysore.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=Fk_RaalNQAQC&pg=PA183 ''Britain as a military power, 1688-1815'' by Jeremy Black, p]</ref><ref>''Cambridge Ilustrated Atlas of Warfare'', p.159</ref> Suffren fought in the [[Battle of Sadras]] on February 17, 1782, the [[Battle of Providien]] on April 12 near [[Trincomalee]], the [[Battle of Negapatam (1782)]] on July 6 off [[Cuddalore]], after which Suffren seized upon the anchorage of Trincomalee compelling the small British garrison to surrender. An army of 3,000 French soldiers collaborated with Hyder Ali to capture [[Cuddalore]]. Finally the [[Battle of Trincomalee]] took place near that port on September 3. These battles can be seen as the last battles of the Franco-British conflict that encompassed the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]], and would cease with the signature of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Versailles (1783)]] establishing peace and recognizing America independence.

===Proposals of Tippu Sahib===
[[File:Louis XVI Receives the Ambassadors of Tipu Sultan 1788 Voyer after Emile Wattier 19th century.jpg|thumb|left|[[Louis XVI]] receives the ambassadors of [[Tippu Sultan]] in 1788, Voyer after [[Emile Wattier]], 19th century.]]
Following the 1783 Treaty of Versailles and the removal of French support, [[Tippu Sahib]], son of Hyder Ali, was unable to recover [[Mangalore]] from the British, although he managed to re-capture it after a 10-month 
[[Siege_of_Mangalore|siege]] in 1784.<ref>''Cambridge Ilustrated Atlas of Warfare'', p.162</ref> He finally made peace with the British in Spring 1784.<ref>''Cambridge Ilustrated Atlas of Warfare'', p.162</ref> 

In 1786, Tippu Sahib nevertheless sent an embassy to France through [[Constantinople]], although the embassy had to be cancelled.<ref>[http://www.tigerandthistle.net/tipu315.htm The National Galleries of Scotland]</ref> In July 1787, Tippu Sabib sent a new embassy directly to Paris, formed of three ambassadors Mohammed Dervich Khan, Akbar Ali Khan and Mohammad Osman Khan, who were accompanied by the French trader from [[Pondicherry]], M. Monneron. After arriving in [[Toulon]], the ambassadors were able to meet with Louis XVI in August 1788 in Versailles.<ref>[http://www.tigerandthistle.net/tipu315.htm The National Galleries of Scotland]</ref> However France, which was now at peace with London, did not wish to resume hostilities.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=n5IOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA11 ''Napoleon and Persia'' by Iradj Amini p.11]</ref> 

Tippu Sahib again proposed an offensive and defensive alliance to France in October 1794, and April 1796.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=n5IOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA11 ''Napoleon and Persia'' by Iradj Amini p.11]</ref> France was hampered in its support to India by the [[French Revolution]], but contacts would resume with the rise of Napol<U+00E9>on.<ref>''Cambridge Ilustrated Atlas of Warfare'', p.162</ref>

==Napoleon's attempted junction with India==
Tipu again made a proposal in October 1797 through [[Anne Joseph Hippolyte de Maur<U+00E8>s, Comte de Malartic|Malartic]], the Governor of [[Mauritius|Ile de France]] (Mauritius).<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=n5IOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA11 ''Napoleon and Persia'' by Iradj Amini p.11]</ref> Malartic, who could not deplete his forces in Ile de France, sent a group of 150 volunteers in the [[frigate]] ''La Preneuse'', on 7 March 1798.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=n5IOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA11 ''Napoleon and Persia'' by Iradj Amini p.11]</ref> ''La Preneuse'' arrived in [[Mangalore]] in April 1798.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=dLURAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA341 ''Historical Sketches of the South of India'' by Mark Wilks p.341]</ref> A group of French officers numbering 124, under the Command of [[Michel Joachim Marie Raymond|Michel Raymond]], was also leading an army of 14,000 for the [[Nizam]], Subhadar of the [[Deccan]] [[Ali Khan Asaf Jah II]], but they were neutralized following British diplomatic intervention.<ref>The dispatches of Field Marshal the Duke of Wellington <U+8457><U+8005>: Arthur Wellesley Wellington, Duke of Wellington, p.4 [http://books.google.com/books?id=2znSAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA4]</ref>

[[Bonaparte]], who wished to establish a French presence in the Middle East, took the opportunity of the [[Campaign of Egypt]] to plan a junction with Tipu against the British.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=o4vrUbMK5eEC&pg=PA13 ''Tricolor and crescent'' William E. Watson p.13-14]</ref> Napoleon assured to the [[Directoire]] that ''"as soon as he had conquered Egypt, he will establish relations with the Indian princes and, together with them, attack the English in their possessions."''<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=n5IOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA12 ''Napoleon and Persia'' by Iradj Amini, p.12]</ref> According to a 13 February 1798 report by [[Talleyrand]]: ''"Having occupied and fortified Egypt, we shall send a force of 15,000 men from [[Suez]] to India, to join the forces of Tipu-Sahib and drive away the English."''<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=n5IOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA12 ''Napoleon and Persia'' by Iradj Amini, p.12]</ref> The Directory, though troubled by the scope and cost of the enterprise, agreed so the popular general would be absent from the centre of power.<ref>Schom 1998, pp.72<U+2013>73</ref>

Napoleon was defeated by the Ottoman Empire helped with England at the [[Siege of Acre (1799)|Siege of Acre]] in 1799, and at the [[Battle of Abukir (1801)|Battle of Abukir]] in 1801, so that by 1802, the French were completely vanquished in the Middle-East.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=UBilxxaKRKkC&pg=PA11 Karsh, p.11]</ref> Soon however, from 1803, Napoleon went to great lengths to try to convince the Ottoman Empire to fight against [[Russia]] in the [[Balkans]] and join his anti-Russian coalition.<ref>Karsh, p.11</ref> Napoleon sent General [[Horace Sebastiani]] as envoy extraordinary, promising to help the Ottoman Empire recover lost territories.<ref>Karsh, p.11</ref> Napoleon also formed a [[Franco-Persian alliance]] in 1807, with the continuous aim of linking with India.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=BzMJys65u9wC&pg=PA97 ''The Islamic world in decline'' by Martin Sicker p.97]</ref>

Napoleon's interest in the Middle-East and India waned when he finally vanquished Russia at the [[Battle of Friedland]] in July 1807, leading to the Treaty of Tilsit, in December 1807.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=BzMJys65u9wC&pg=PA97 ''The Islamic world in decline'' by Martin Sicker p.97]</ref> France as an ally of Russia became a strong repellent to both the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Persia]]. Great Britain signed a mutual defense treaty with Shah [[Shuja al-Mulk]] of [[Afghanistan]] on 17 June 1809 in order to better resist the Franco-Persian threat, but by that time Persia had already denounced its alliance with France and was moving towards Great Britain.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=BzMJys65u9wC&pg=PA97 ''The Islamic world in decline'' by Martin Sicker p.97-98]</ref> These last events rendered the Franco-Indian alliance impossible to pursue further.
