On November 17, 2008, the [[U.S. Navy]] announced that the ''Sirius Star'' had been hijacked by [[Piracy in Somalia|Somali pirates]].  Lt. Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the [[United States Fifth Fleet|U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet]], said the pirates hijacked the very large crude carrier at about 10:00 a.m. on Saturday, November 15, while it was southbound, about {{convert|450|nmi|mi km|lk=in}} southeast of the coast of [[Kenya]] <U+2014> the farthest out to sea Somali pirates have struck.<ref name="CSM"/><ref name=ap1>Associated Press, "Somali Pirates Hijack Saudi Tanker", (Washington, D.C.), ''Express'', November 18, 2008, p. 8.</ref>  The attack also made ''Sirius Star'' the largest vessel ever to be hijacked.<ref name="largest"/>  It is estimated that for the pirates to reach the ''Sirius Star'', they must have voyaged south for three to four days.<ref name="Somali pirates hijack Saudi Arabian-owned oil tanker ">{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-11/18/content_10372938.htm|title=Somali pirates hijack Saudi Arabian-owned oil tanker |date=2008-11-18|work=www.chinaview.cn |publisher=XINHUA Net|accessdate=2008-11-18}}</ref>

At the time of the attack, the ship was carrying a full load of {{convert|2000000|oilbbl|m3|lk=in}} of crude oil {{emdash}} more than one-quarter of [[Saudi Arabia]]'s daily oil production output, and worth at least US$100&nbsp;million<ref>{{cite news |first=Catherine |last=Philp |title=Somali pirates hijack Saudi oil tanker with Britons on board |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article5172770.ece |publisher=The Times |date=2008-11-18 |accessdate=2008-11-17}}</ref> {{emdash}} and was bound for the United States via the [[Cape of Good Hope]].<ref name="Pirates capture Saudi oil tanker ">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7733482.stm|title=Pirates capture Saudi oil tanker |date=17 November 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-11-18}}</ref> According to officials from [[Puntland]], the pirates anchored ''Sirius Star'' at the Somali port of [[Harardhere]], contrary to early reports from the [[United States Navy]] that the ship was  anchored near [[Eyl]].<ref name=guardian>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/17/oil-tanker-pirates|title=

As a result of the full load of cargo, the height from the main deck to the waterline was relatively low; if her reported draft of 22 metres was correct, she had a freeboard of about {{convert|9|m}} .  Ships in this low-[[freeboard]] condition are easier to climb aboard and thus easier targets for pirates.  It is not clear if there was a security team on the vessel.<ref name="largest">{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hN1EMARGCe11pJ_7BXMKIedC_DVA|title=Saudi super-tanker taken to Somali pirate lair|date=2008-11-18|publisher=[[Google News]]|agency=[[Agence_France-Presse|AFP]]|accessdate=2008-11-18}}</ref>

===Ransom demand and deadline===
On November 19, the alleged pirate, Farah Abd Jameh, provided information regarding the ransom by audio tape broadcast over Al-Jazeera television.<ref name="timesbrown"/>  The tape specified that an unspecified cash ransom was to be delivered to the ''Sirius Star'', where it would be counted using machines that were able to detect counterfeit bills.<ref name="timesbrown"/>
{{Wikinews|Negotiations for hijacked Saudi oil tanker begin}}
On November 20, the pirates demanded a [[$US]]&nbsp;25&nbsp;million ransom having set a 10-day deadline. Mohamed Said stated: "We do not want long-term discussions to resolve the matter. The Saudis have 10 days to comply, otherwise we will take action that could be disastrous."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7739153.stm  Somali tanker pirates 'want $25m']</ref><ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article5196008.ece  Somali pirates demand $25m ransom for supertanker]</ref><ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1087488/Somali-pirates-demand-25m-ransom-safe-return-Sirius-Star-ship.html   Somali pirates demand $25m ransom for safe return of Sirius Star ship]</ref> British foreign secretary David Miliband ruled out Britain paying any form of ransom, saying "There is a strong view of the British Government, and actually the international community, that payments for hostage-taking are only an encouragement to further hostage-taking."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7739604.stm No ransoms for pirates, UK insists]</ref>

=== Effects of the hijacking ===
[[Image:Sirius_Star_2008a.jpg|thumb|200px|After hijack the vessel was anchored at [[Harardhere]], Somalia]]
The attack came soon after naval forces from [[NATO]], [[Russia]], and [[India]] began to patrol the Horn of Africa region, in response to the [[MV Faina|MV ''Faina'']] hijacking seven weeks earlier and many other incidents. However, these patrols focus further north, especially near the [[Gulf of Aden]], and the attack came as a surprise. A British intelligence expert commented that "there will never be enough warships" to secure so much of the Indian Ocean by patrol.<ref name=yahoo>{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081117/ap_on_re_af/ml_piracy|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5cTY6IAYX|archivedate=2008-11-20|title=Somali pirates seize supertanker loaded with crude|date=2008-11-17|publisher=Accociated Press via Yahoo News}}</ref> 

This attack has shown that the pirates are now operating in an area of over {{convert|1.1|e6sqmi|e6km2}},<ref name="Pirates take 'super tanker' towards Somalia">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/11/17/kenya.tanker.pirates/index.html?eref=rss_world|title=Pirates take 'super tanker' towards Somalia|date=17 November 2008|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2008-11-18}}</ref> which extends beyond the recently-established international patrols closer to the [[Horn of Africa]].<ref name=ap1>Associated Press, "Somali Pirates Hijack Saudi Tanker", (Washington, D.C.), ''Express'', November 18, 2008, p. 8.</ref>  [[BBC News]] has reported that news of the attack raised crude oil prices on global markets.<ref name="Pirates capture Saudi oil tanker " />
{{Quotation|The hijacking was shocking because it highlighted the vulnerability of even very large ships and pointed to widening ambitions and capabilities among ransom-hungry pirates who have carried out a surge of attacks this year off Somalia.  To attack so large a vessel and so far south of Somalia presents a nearly impossible security problem for the anti-piracy naval task force. |Lieutenant Nate Christensen, spokesman for the [[U.S. Navy]]'s [[United States Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleet]]|[[CNN]].com''<ref name="Pirates take 'super tanker' towards Somalia" />}}
