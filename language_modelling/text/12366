'''''Ghost World''''' is a 2001 [[Comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] directed by [[Terry Zwigoff]], based on the [[comic book]] [[Ghost World|of the same name]] and screenplay by [[Daniel Clowes]]. The story focuses on the life of two teenage friends, Enid and Rebecca, who are outside of the normal [[high school]] [[social order]] in an unnamed American city.

==Plot==
The film follows the lives of best friends Enid ([[Thora Birch]]) and Rebecca ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) during the summer after their high-school graduation. The girls are both social outcasts, but Becky is more popular with boys than Enid. Enid's diploma is awarded on the condition that she attend a remedial art class. Even though she is a talented artist, her art teacher, Roberta ([[Illeana Douglas]]), believes art must be socially meaningful and dismisses Enid's sketches as "light entertainment".

Shortly after graduation, the two girls see a [[Personals|personal ad]] in which a lonely man named Seymour ([[Steve Buscemi|Buscemi]]) asks a woman he met recently to contact him. With Becky at her side, Enid makes a prank phone call to Seymour, pretending to be the woman and inviting him to meet her at a diner, and when he goes there, the two girls secretly watch and make fun of him. However, Enid begins to feel sorry for him, so a few days later they follow him to his apartment building, where they find him selling vintage records in a garage sale. Enid buys an old [[blues]] album from him, and she and he gradually become friends. One of her favorite activities is trying to find women for him to date. Meanwhile, Enid has been attending her art class. In order to please Roberta, Enid persuades Seymour to lend her an old poster depicting a grotesquely caricatured black man, which was once used as a promotional tool by the fried-chicken franchise where Seymour holds a [[middle management]] position. In class, she presents the poster as a social comment about racism, and Roberta is so impressed with the concept that she later offers Enid a scholarship to an art college.

At this point, Enid's and Becky's lives have seriously diverged. While Enid has been spending time with Seymour, Becky has found a job and become more interested in clothing, boys, and other material things. Enid finds a job so the girls can rent an apartment together, but she is fired after only one day. Finally, Becky gives up on looking for an apartment with Enid after their personal differences erupt in an angry argument. Sometime after Enid loses her job, Seymour receives a phone call from Dana ([[Stacey Travis]]), the woman he had written to in the personal ad. Enid encourages him to develop a relationship with Dana, but becomes jealous when he begins avoiding Enid to spend time with Dana. At the end of the summer, Enid's and Seymour's lives fall apart. When Enid's poster is displayed in an art show, school officials find it so offensive they force Roberta to give her a failing grade; when Enid discovers she has lost her scholarship, she visits Seymour for solace, resulting in a drunken [[one-night stand]]. Seymour then breaks up with Dana before realizing he has no chance with Enid, and loses his job after the poster is displayed in a newspaper. Becky tells Seymour about Enid's phone prank, and he becomes hospitalized after attacking a boy who was with the girls at the time.

Finally, Enid gives in to her childhood fantasy of running away from home. Throughout the film, she has periodically spoken with an old man named Norman who was waiting at an unused bus stop for a bus that never arrived. After quitting her new job and meeting with Seymour in the hospital, Enid sees a bus finally arrive to pick up Norman, and the next day, while Seymour discusses the summer's events with his therapist, Enid goes to the bus stop and gets on the bus when it arrives. The film ends as the bus drives away.

===Critical reaction===
The film's critical reception has been highly positive; it currently has a 92% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and an 88 metascore on [[Metacritic]]. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, "I wanted to hug this movie. It takes such a risky journey and never steps wrong. It creates specific, original, believable, lovable characters, and meanders with them through their inconsolable days, never losing its sense of humor".<ref name= "ebert">{{cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | coauthors = | title = ''Ghost World'' | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = August 3, 2001 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20010803/REVIEWS/108030301/1023 | accessdate = 2009-03-19 }}</ref> In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', A.O.

Arnold wrote, "Unlike those shrill, hard-sell teen comedies on the other screens, ''Ghost World'' never becomes the kind of empty, defensive snark-fest that it targets.

Worst of all, she's rarely funny and never charming ... Enid's favorite targets are people who are older, poorer or dumber than she is, which is to say that the California wasteland fashioned by Mr. Zwigoff and Mr. Clowes seems made up almost entirely of stooges for Enid and Rebecca to tease and taunt".<ref name= "sarris">{{cite news | last = Sarris | first = Andrew | coauthors = | title = So You Wanna Be a Country-and-Western Star | work = [[The New York Observer]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = August 5, 2001 | url = http://www.observer.com/node/44812 | accessdate = 2009-03-19 }}</ref>

The score to ''Ghost World'' is composed by orchestrator and arranger David Kitay, an excerpt of his work for the film is heard on the last track of the soundtrack album.

Music in the film includes "[[Jaan Pehechan Ho]]" by [[Mohammed Rafi]], a dance number from the 1965 [[Bollywood]] musical ''[[Gumnaam]]'' (which Enid watches and dances to early in the film), and "Devil Got My Woman" by [[Skip James]] in 1931, as well as "Pickin' Cotton Blues" by the bar band, Blueshammer.

There are songs by other artists mentioned in the film, including [[Lionel Belasco]], which are reflective of the character Seymour, and of director [[Terry Zwigoff]] himself, who is a collector of 78 RPM [[Gramophone record|records]], as portrayed by Seymour. Other tracks are by [[Vince Giordano]], a musician who specializes in meticulous recreations of songs from old 78 RPM records. Track 14-19 are not in the film, being selections from Zwigoff's collection.

Referenced in the film is [[R. Crumb & His Cheap Suit Serenaders]], a band that Zwigoff played in. Enid asks Seymour about the band's second album, ''Chasin' Rainbows'', and Seymour replies, "Nah, that one's not so great."

Missing from the soundtrack is "What Do I Get" by [[The Buzzcocks]], which can be heard when Enid dresses up like a punk, and the song "A Smile and a Ribbon" by [[Patience and Prudence]].
