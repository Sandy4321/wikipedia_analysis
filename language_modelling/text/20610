'''Johnny D. Bright''' ([[June 11]], [[1930]] &ndash; [[December 14]], [[1983]]) was a professional [[Canadian football|football]] player in the [[Canadian Football League]] (primarily with the [[Edmonton Eskimos]]) and an outstanding [[college football|American college football]] player at [[Drake University]]. Born in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]], Bright is a member of the [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]], the [[National Football Foundation]]'s [[College Football Hall of Fame]], the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] Hall of Fame, the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] [[Edmonton Eskimos#Wall of Honour|Wall of Honour]], the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame, and the ''[[Des Moines Register|Des Moines Register's]]'' Iowa Sports Hall of Fame. 

In 1951, Bright was named a First Team [[College Football All-America Team|College Football All-American]], and was awarded the [[Nils V. "Swede" Nelson]] Sportsmanship Award. In 1969, Bright was named Drake University's greatest football player of all time. Bright is the only Drake football player to have his jersey number (#43) retired by the school, and in June, 2006, received honorable mention from ''[[ESPN]].com'' senior writer [[Ivan Maisel]] as one of the best college football players to ever wear #43.<ref name="Johnny Bright's Football Jersey Number Recognized">{{cite web | url = http://www.drakebulldogs.org/football/newsstory.php?nid=1151679923 | accessdate = 2006-07-08 | title = Johnny Bright's Football Jersey Number Recognized | publisher = DrakeBulldogs.org | date = 2006-06-30}}</ref>  In February, 2006, the football field at [[Drake Stadium]], in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], was named in his honor.<ref name="KCCI-TV8 Des Moines, Iowa - Drake Names Football Field After Johnny Bright: OSU Apologizes For Player's Actions">{{cite web | url = http://www.kcci.com/sports/7374962/detail.html?rss=des&psp=sports | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | title = KCCI-TV8 Des Moines, Iowa - Drake Names Football Field After Johnny Bright: OSU Apologizes For Player's Actions | publisher = KCCI.com | date = 2006-02-23}}</ref> In November, 2006, Bright was voted one of the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]]'s top 50 players (#19) of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network [[The Sports Network|TSN]].<ref name="TSN Top 50 CFL Players">{{cite web | url = http://www.tsn.ca/cfl/feature/?fid=10866 | accessdate = 2007-04-28 | author = | title = TSN Top 50 CFL Players | publisher = TSN.ca | date = 2006-11-28}}</ref>

In addition to his outstanding professional and college football careers, Bright is perhaps best known for his role as the victim of an intentional, most likely racially motivated, on-field assault by an opposing college football player from Oklahoma A&M (now [[Oklahoma State University - Stillwater|Oklahoma State]]) on [[October 20]], [[1951]], that was captured in a widely disseminated and [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning photo sequence, and eventually came to be known as the "[[Johnny Bright Incident]]."

==College football career==

Bright was a three-sport ([[American football|football]], [[basketball]], [[track and field]]) star at [[Central High School]] in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]]. Following his graduation from Central High in 1947, Bright accepted a track and field scholarship from Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, that allowed him to try out for the football and [[basketball]] squads.<ref name="Bright joins Iowa 'Hall'">{{cite web | url = http://desmoinesregister.com/sports/extras/hall/bright.html | accessdate = 2006-08-14 | author = Turnbull, Buck || title = Bright joins Iowa "Hall" | publisher = ''Des Moines Register''| date = 1970-03-24}}</ref> Bright eventually lettered in football, [[Athletics (track and field)|track]], and basketball, during his collegiate career at Drake.<ref name="Bright joins Iowa 'Hall'">{{cite web | url = http://desmoinesregister.com/sports/extras/hall/bright.html | accessdate = 2006-08-14 | author = Turnbull, Buck || title = Bright joins Iowa "Hall" | publisher = ''Des Moines Register''| date = 1970-03-24}}</ref>

Following a mandatory freshman [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] year, Bright began his collegiate football career in earnest in 1949, rushing for 975 yards and throwing for another 975 to lead the nation in total offense during his sophomore year, as the [[Drake Bulldogs]] finished their season at 6<U+2013>2<U+2013>1.<ref name="The Legend of Johnny Bright - Drake's Greatest Football Player">{{cite web | url = http://www.drakebulldogs.org/football/1124468492.pdf | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | title = 2005 Drake Bulldogs Football Media Guide: The Legend of Johnny Bright - Drake's Greatest Football Player | publisher = Drake University | date = 2005}}</ref>  In Bright's junior year, the [[Running back|halfback]]/[[quarterback]] rushed for 1,232 yards and passed for 1,168 yards, setting an [[NCAA]] record for total offense (2,400 yards) in 1950, and again lead the Bulldogs to a 6<U+2013>2<U+2013>1 record.<ref name="The Legend of Johnny Bright - Drake's Greatest Football Player">{{cite web | url = http://www.drakebulldogs.org/football/1124468492.pdf | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | title = 2005 Drake Bulldogs Football Media Guide: The Legend of Johnny Bright - Drake's Greatest Football Player | publisher = Drake University | date = 2005}}</ref>

Bright's senior year began with great promise. Bright was considered a pre-season [[Heisman Trophy]] candidate, and was leading the nation in both rushing and total offense with 821 and 1,349 yards respectively, when the Drake Bulldogs, winners of their previous five games, faced [[Missouri Valley Conference]] foe [[Oklahoma State Cowboys|Oklahoma A&M]] at Lewis Field (now [[Boone Pickens Stadium]]) in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]], on [[October 20]], [[1951]].

==The "Johnny Bright Incident"==

{{Main|Johnny Bright Incident}}
Bright's participation as a halfback/quarterback in the [[Drake University]] vs. Oklahoma A&M football game on [[October 20]], [[1951]] was controversial, as it marked the first time that such a prominent [[African-American]] athlete, with national notoriety (Bright was a pre-season [[Heisman Trophy]] candidate and led the nation in total offense going into the game) and of critical importance to the success of his team (Drake was undefeated and carried a five game winning streak into the contest, due in large part to Bright's rushing and passing dominance), had played against Oklahoma A&M in a home game at Lewis Field, in Stillwater.<ref name="Aggies Outlast Drake, 27-14">{{cite web | url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&CISOPTR=26&REC=2 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | author = White, Maury | title = Aggies Outlast Drake, 27-14 | publisher = Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') | date = 1951-10-21}}</ref> During the first seven minutes of the game, Bright had been knocked unconscious three times by blows from Oklahoma A&M [[defensive tackle]], [[Wilbanks Smith]]. While the final, elbow blow from Smith broke Bright's jaw, Bright was able to complete a 61-yard touchdown pass to Drake halfback [[Jim Pilkington]] a few plays later before the injury finally forced Bright to leave the game. Bright finished the game with 75 yards (14 yards rushing and 61 yards passing), the first time he had finished a game with less than 100 yards in his three year collegiate career at Drake.  Oklahoma A&M eventually won the game 27-14.<ref name="Aggies Outlast Drake, 27-14">{{cite web | url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&CISOPTR=26&REC=2 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | author = White, Maury | title = Aggies Outlast Drake, 27-14 | publisher = Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') | date = 1951-10-21}}</ref>   

[[Bob Spiegel]], a ''[[Des Moines Register]]'' reporter, interviewed several spectators after the game, eventually publishing a report in the [[October 30]], [[1951]] issue of the ''Register'' about what was soon to become known as the "[[Johnny Bright Incident]]."  According to Spiegel's report, several Oklahoma A&M students he interviewed overheard an Oklahoma A&M coach repeatedly say "get that nigger" whenever the A&M practice squad ran Drake football plays against the Oklahoma A&M starting defense.<ref name="Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports">{{cite web | url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&CISOPTR=36&REC=4 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | author = Hanson, Dave | title = Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports | publisher = Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') | date = 1980-11-13}}</ref> A businessman Spiegel interviewed told him that as he and his wife sat behind a group of Oklahoma A&M practice squad players as the game began, one of the players turned around said, "we're gonna get that nigger."<ref name="Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports">{{cite web | url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&CISOPTR=36&REC=4 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | author = Hanson, Dave | title = Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports | publisher = Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') | date = 1980-11-13}}</ref> After the first blow to Bright was delivered by Smith, the same player again turned around and told the businessman, "see that knot on my jaw? That same guy (Smith) gave me that the very same way in practice."<ref name="Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports">{{cite web | url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&CISOPTR=36&REC=4 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | author = Hanson, Dave | title = Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports | publisher = Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') | date = 1980-11-13}}</ref>

A [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning photographic sequence by ''Des Moines Register'' cameramen Don Ultang and John Robinson clearly showed that Smith's vicious, jaw breaking blow to Bright had occurred well after Bright had handed off the ball to Drake [[fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[Gene Macomber]], and that the blow was delivered well behind the play.<ref name="Bright's Jaw Broken, Drake Streak Ends, 27-14">{{cite web | url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&CISOPTR=40&REC=8 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | first = John | last = Robinson | authorlink =  | coauthors = Don Ultang | title = Bright's Jaw Broken, Drake Streak Ends, 27-14 | publisher = Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') | date = 1951-10-21}}</ref>  The photographic sequence of the incident was widely disseminated, won Robinson and Ultang the 1952 Pulitzer Prize, and eventually made the cover of ''[[Life Magazine]]''.

Because of the incident and because both Oklahoma A&M and the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] refused to take any disciplinary action against Smith, Drake University (along with fellow [[Missouri Valley Conference|Conference]] member [[Bradley University]]) withdrew from the Conference, in protest, for several years.<ref name="1951 John Bright incident causes Drake withdrawal from MVC">{{cite web | url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&CISOPTR=37&REC=1 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | author = Moorhead, Jim | title = 1951 John Bright incident causes Drake withdrawal from MVC | publisher = Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') | date = 1964-10-30}}</ref> The "Johnny Bright Incident" did bring about changes in collegiate football rules regarding illegal blocking, and also required the use of more protective helmets with face guards.<ref name="Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports">{{cite web | url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&CISOPTR=36&REC=4 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | author = Hanson, Dave | title = Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports | publisher = Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') | date = 1980-11-13}}</ref>

Bright's jaw injury limited his effectiveness for the remainder of his senior season at Drake, but he finished his college career with 5,983 yards in total offense, averaging better than 236 yards per game in total offense, and scored 384 points in 25 games.<ref name="The Legend of Johnny Bright - Drake's Greatest Football Player">{{cite web | url = http://www.drakebulldogs.org/football/1124468492.pdf | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | title = 2005 Drake Bulldogs Football Media Guide: The Legend of Johnny Bright - Drake's Greatest Football Player | publisher = Drake University | date = 2005}}</ref>  As a senior, Bright earned 70 percent of the yards Drake gained and scored 70 percent of the [[Drake Bulldogs|Bulldogs]]' points, despite missing the better part of the final three games of the season. Bright finished fifth in the balloting for the 1951 [[Heisman Trophy]], and played in the post-season [[East-West Shrine Game]] and the [[Hula Bowl]].

Drake University and fellow [[Missouri Valley Conference]] member [[Bradley University]] withdrew from the Conference in protest for several years, not only in response to the Bright incident, but because both Oklahoma A&M and the Conference refused to take any disciplinary action against Wilbanks Smith.<ref name="1951 John Bright incident causes Drake withdrawal from MVC">{{cite web | url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&CISOPTR=37&REC=1 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | author = Moorhead, Jim | title = 1951 John Bright incident causes Drake withdrawal from MVC | publisher = Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') | date = 1964-10-30}}</ref> The "Johnny Bright Incident", as it became widely known, eventually provoked changes in [[NCAA]] football rules regarding illegal blocking, and mandated the use of more protective helmets with face guards.<ref name="Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports">{{cite web | url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&CISOPTR=36&REC=4 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | author = Hanson, Dave | title = Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports | publisher = Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') | date = 1980-11-13}}</ref>

Recalling the incident without apparent bitterness in a 1980 ''Des Moines Register'' interview three years before his [[Johnny Bright#death|death]], Bright commented: {{cquote|There's no way it couldn't have been racially motivated. Bright went on to add: What I like about the whole deal now, and what I'm smug enough to say, is that getting a broken jaw has somehow made college athletics better. It made the NCAA take a hard look and clean up some things that were bad.<ref name="Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports">{{cite web | last = Hanson | first = Dave | url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&CISOPTR=36&REC=4 | title = Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports | format = | work = | publisher = Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') | accessdate = August 12 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>}}

When asked about Smith, whom he had not seen since the incident, Bright said he felt "null and void" about Smith, but added:{{cquote|The thing has been a great influence on my life.  My total philosophy of life now is that, whatever a person's bias and limitation, they deserve respect.  Everyone's entitled to their own beliefs.<ref name="Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports">{{cite web | last = Hanson | first = Dave | url = http://ddr.lib.drake.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/du-jb&CISOPTR=36&REC=4 | title = Bright not bitter:  Blow helped clean up sports | format = | work = | publisher = Drake University Digital Collections (reprinted with the permission of the ''Des Moines Register'') | accessdate = August 12 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>}}

==Professional football career==
Bright was the first pick of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in the first round of the 1952 [[National Football League]] draft. Bright spurned the NFL, electing to play for the [[Calgary Stampeders]] of the [[Canadian Football League]]. Bright was the first NFL first-round draft pick to bypass the NFL for the CFL. Bright later commented:  {{cquote|I would have been their (the Eagles') first [[African American|Negro]] player. There was a tremendous influx of [[Southern United States|Southern]] players into the NFL at that time, and I didn't know what kind of treatment I could expect.<ref name="CFL Legend:  Johnny Bright">{{cite web | last = Soutar | first = Ted | url = http://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&id=56 | title = CFL Legend:  Johnny Bright | format = | work = | publisher = CFL.ca | accessdate = August 12 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>}}

Bright joined the Calgary Stampeders as a [[fullback (American football)|fullback]]/[[linebacker]] in [[1952 in Canadian football|1952]], leading the Stampeders and the [[Canadian Football League West Division|CFL Western Conference]] in rushing with 815 yards his rookie season.<ref name="CFL Legend:  Johnny Bright">{{cite web | url = http://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&id=56 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | author = Soutar, Ted | title = CFL Legend:  Johnny Bright | publisher = CFL.ca | date = }}</ref>  Bright played fullback/linebacker with the Stampeders for the [[1952 in Canadian football|1952]], [[1953 in Canadian football|1953]], and part of the [[1954 in Canadian football|1954]] seasons. In 1954, the Calgary Stampeders dealt Bright to the CFL's [[Edmonton Eskimos]] in a mid-season trade. Bright would enjoy the most success of his professional football career as a member of the Eskimos.

Though Bright played strictly defense as a linebacker in his first year with the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] ([[1954 in Canadian football|1954]]), he played both offense (as a fullback) and defense for two seasons ([[1955 in Canadian football|1955]]-[[1956 in Canadian football|56]]), and played offense (fullback) permanently after that ([[1957 in Canadian football|1957]]-[[1964 CFL season|64]]). Bright, along with stand out Eskimo teammates [[Rollie Miles]], [[Normie Kwong]], and [[Jackie Parker]], helped lead the Edmonton Eskimos to successive [[Grey Cup]] titles in [[1954 in Canadian football#Grey Cup Championship|1954]], [[1955 in Canadian football#Grey Cup Championship|1955]], and [[1956 in Canadian football#Grey Cup Championship|1956]] (where Bright rushed for a Grey Cup record 171 yards in a 50-27 triumph over the [[Montreal Alouettes]]).<ref name="CFL Legend:  Johnny Bright">{{cite web | url = http://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&id=56 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | author = Soutar, Ted | title = CFL Legend:  Johnny Bright | publisher = CFL.ca | date = }}</ref> In [[1957 in Canadian football|1957]], Bright rushed for eight consecutive 100-yard games, finishing the season with 1,679 yards. In [[1958 CFL season|1958]], Bright rushed for 1,722 yards.<ref name="CFL Legend:  Johnny Bright">{{cite web | url = http://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&id=56 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | author = Soutar, Ted | title = CFL Legend:  Johnny Bright | publisher = CFL.ca | date = }}</ref> In [[1959 CFL season|1959]], following his third straight season as the CFL's rushing leader with 1,340 yards, Bright won the [[CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award]], the first [[African-American]] or [[African-Canadian]] athlete to be so honored. 

Bright was approached several times during his CFL career by NFL teams about playing in the [[United States]], but in the days before the blockbuster salaries of today's NFL players, it was common for CFL players such as Bright to hold regular jobs in addition to football, and he had already started a [[teacher|teaching]] career in 1957, the year Bright moved his family to [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]]. {{cquote|I'd established a home and [[Canada]] had been good to me. I might have been interested, if the offers could have matched what I was making from both football and teaching.<ref name="CFL Legend:  Johnny Bright">{{cite web | last = Soutar | first = Ted | url = http://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&id=56 | title = CFL Legend:  Johnny Bright | format = | work = | publisher = CFL.ca | accessdate = August 12 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>}}

Bright retired in [[1964 CFL season|1964]] as the CFL's all-time leading rusher ([[Mike Pringle (football)|Mike Pringle]] and [[George Reed]] have since surpassed him). Bright rushed for 10,909 yards in 13 seasons, had five consecutive 1,000 yard seasons, and led the CFL in rushing four times. While Bright is currently 15th on the All-Pro Rushing list, his career average of 5.5 yards per carry is the highest ([[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]r [[Jim Brown]] is second at 5.2 yards per carry).<ref name="CFL Legend:  Johnny Bright">{{cite web | url = http://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&id=56 | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | author = Soutar, Ted | title = CFL Legend:  Johnny Bright | publisher = CFL.ca | date = }}</ref> Bright had a CFL record thirty-six 100-plus-yard games, carrying the ball 200 or more times for five straight seasons. Bright led the [[Canadian Football League West Division|CFL Western Conference]] in rushing four times, winning the [[Eddie James Memorial Trophy]] in the process, and was a CFL Western Conference All-Star five straight seasons from [[1957 in Canadian football#CFL All Stars|1957]] to [[1961 CFL season#CFL All Stars|1961]]. Bright played in 197 consecutive CFL games as a fullback/linebacker. Bright's #24 jersey was added to the Edmonton Eskimos' [[Edmonton Eskimos#Wall of Honour|Wall of Honour]] at the Eskimos' [[Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)|Commonwealth Stadium]] in 1983. Bright was inducted into the [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]] on [[November 26]], [[1970]]. In [[November]], [[2006]], Bright was voted one of the CFL's top 50 players (#19) of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network [[The Sports Network|TSN]].<ref name="TSN Top 50 CFL Players">{{cite web | url = http://www.tsn.ca/cfl/feature/?fid=10866 | accessdate = 2007-04-28 | author = | title = TSN Top 50 CFL Players | publisher = TSN.ca | date = 2006-11-28}}</ref>
