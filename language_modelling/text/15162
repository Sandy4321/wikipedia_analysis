As many as 400 individual fires were recorded on 7 February. Following the events of 7 February 2009 and its aftermath, that day has become widely referred to as Black Saturday.

==Overview==
[[File:Major Victorian bushfires in the 2000s.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Major bushfires in Victoria in the 2000s, showing the Black Saturday fires in red]]

===Conditions===
The majority of the fires ignited and spread on a day of some of the worst bushfire-weather conditions ever recorded. Background temperatures reached 46 degrees Celsius (115&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) and northwesterly winds were over {{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. This had been precipitated by an [[Early 2009 southeastern Australia heat wave|intense heat wave]] and almost two months of little or no rain. A cool change hit the state in the early evening, bringing with it lower temperatures but gale-force southwesterly winds in excess of {{convert|120|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. This change in wind direction caused the long eastern flanks of the fires to become massive fire fronts that burned with incredible speed and ferocity towards towns that had earlier escaped the flames.

===Losses===
Beyond the 173 deaths, 120 of them caused by a single firestorm, the fires destroyed over 2,030 houses and more than 3,500 structures,<ref name="homeslost">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA20090313005|title=Victorian Bushfires|date=13 March 2009 |publisher=New South Wales Government|work=Parliament of New South Wales|accessdate=14 December 2009}}</ref> and damaged thousands more. Many towns northeast of [[Melbourne]], the state capital, were badly damaged, and [[Kinglake, Victoria|Kinglake]], [[Marysville, Victoria|Marysville]], [[Narbethong, Victoria|Narbethong]], [[Strathewen, Victoria|Strathewen]],and [[Flowerdale, Victoria|Flowerdale]] were all but completely destroyed.<ref name="Marysville 8 Feb">{{Cite news| title=Marysville almost destroyed in Victorian bushfires |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/marysville-devastated/2009/02/08/1234027832317.html |date=8 February 2009 | publisher= Sydney Morning Herald | work= Fairfax Media |accessdate=8 February 2009}}</ref><ref name="Marysville">{{Cite news|title='Absolute devastation': Victoria gutted by deadly bushfires |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/02/08/2485299.htm|date=8 February 2009 |work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=8 February 2009}}</ref> Houses in the towns of  Pheasant Creek (Pheasant Creek, Victoria) [[Steels Creek, Victoria|Steels Creek]], [[Humevale, Victoria|Humevale]], [[Clonbinane, Victoria|Clonbinane]], [[Wandong, Victoria|Wandong]], [[St Andrews, Victoria|St Andrews]], [[Callignee, Victoria|Callignee]], [[Taggerty, Victoria|Taggerty]], and [[Koornalla, Victoria|Koornalla]] were also destroyed or severely damaged, with fatalities recorded at each location. The loss of life on this day was much larger than previous bushfires in the country. The death toll of Black Saturday is almost double that of [[Ash Wednesday fires|Ash Wednesday 1983]].   

The fires affected 78 townships and displaced an estimated 7,562 people.<ref name="homeslost"/> Many of those displaced sought temporary accommodation, much of it donated in the form of spare rooms, caravans, tents, and beds in community relief centres.

===Causes===
The majority of the fires were ignited by fallen or [[Short circuit|clashing]] [[power lines]], or were [[Arson|deliberately lit]].<ref name='arson' /> Other suspected ignition sources included [[lightning]],<ref name='lightning grampians' /> cigarette butts,<ref name="Bendigo_cig_butts">{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,25027063-1243,00.html |title=Cigarette butt blamed for West Bendigo fire; two dead, 50 homes lost |date=9 February 2009 |work=News.com.au |accessdate=9 February 2009}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> and sparks from a power tool.<ref name="sparks">{{Cite news|title=Police track arsonists responsible for Victoria bushfires |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25032884-2702,00.html |date=10 February 2009 | publisher = The Australian | work= News Limited |accessdate=14 February 2009}}</ref> Also implicated in the underlying conditions was a major [[Drought in Australia|drought]] that had persisted for more than a decade, as well as a domestic {{nowrap|50-year}} warming trend that has been linked to human-induced [[climate change]],<ref name=CSIROFAQ/><ref>{{Cite news|author=Stoddard, Ed|author=Milliken, Mary|title=FACTBOX:  The world's water and climate change|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSTRE52900F20090310|accessdate=9 March 2009|publisher=Reuters|date=9 March 2009}}</ref> as well as an absence of fuel reduction burning.<ref name=" Fuel reduction target 'mystery'">{{Cite news|url= http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/fuel-reduction-target-mystery-20100217-odxb.html |title= Fuel reduction target 'mystery'|date= 18 February 2010 |work=theage.com.au |accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref> By early to mid-March, favourable conditions aided containment efforts, and helped to extinguish the fires.

[[File:Melbourne City Heatwave Min & Max Temps 09 (Concept).png|thumb|right|220px|Temperature graph for [[Melbourne]] during the peak of the heatwave]]
<!-- this includes some information from [[Early 2009 southeastern Australia heat wave]] -->
A week before the fires, an exceptional heatwave affected southeastern Australia. From 28<U+2013>30 January, [[Melbourne]] broke records by sweltering through three consecutive days above {{convert|43|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}}, with the temperature peaking at {{convert|45.1|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} on 30 January, the third hottest day in the city's history.

The heatwave was caused by a slow moving [[Atmospheric pressure|high-pressure system]] that settled over the [[Tasman Sea]], with a combination of an intense [[Tropical Cyclone|tropical low]] located off the [[North West Australia]]n coast and a [[monsoon trough]] over [[northern Australia]], which produced ideal conditions for hot tropical air to be directed down over southeastern Australia.<ref name="NatClimate">{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/statements/scs17d.pdf|title=The exceptional January<U+2013>February 2009 heatwave in southeastern Australia|date=12 February 2009 |publisher=National Climate Centre| work=Bureau of Meteorology |accessdate=18 November 2009}}</ref>

The February fires commenced on a day when several localities across the state, including [[Melbourne]], recorded their highest temperatures since records began in 1859.<ref name="HottestDay">{{Cite news|last=Townsend |first=Hamish | url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/city-swelters-records-tumble-in-heat-20090207-80ai.html | title=City swelters, records tumble in heat | date=7 February 2009 | publisher = The Age | work=  Fairfax Media | accessdate=7 February 2009 | location=Melbourne}}</ref> On 6 February 2009&mdash;the day before the fires started&mdash;the [[Premier of Victoria]] [[John Brumby]] issued a warning about the [[extreme weather]] conditions expected on 7&nbsp;February: "It's just as bad a day as you can imagine and on top of that the state is just tinder-dry.

==Events of Saturday 7 February==
[[File:Melbourne-temp-2009-02-07.png|thumb|300px|right|Melbourne air temperature on 7 February 2009 and the preceding and following days.]]
A total of 3,582 firefighting personnel, mainly from the [[Country Fire Authority|Country Fire Authority (CFA)]] and [[Department of Sustainability and Environment, Victoria|Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE)]], were deployed across the state on the morning of 7 February in anticipation of the extreme conditions. By mid-morning, hot northwesterly winds in excess of {{convert|100|km/h|mph}} hit the state, accompanied by extremely high temperatures and extremely low humidity; a total fire ban was declared for the entire state.

As the day progressed, all-time record temperatures were being reached. Melbourne hit {{convert|46.4|C|F}}, the hottest temperature ever recorded in an Australian capital city,<ref name="HottestDay"/> and humidity levels dropped to as low as six percent. The [[McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index]] reached unprecedented levels, ranging from 120 to over 200. This was higher than the fire weather conditions experienced on [[Black Friday (1939)|Black Friday]] in 1939 and [[Ash Wednesday fires|Ash Wednesday]] in 1983.<ref name="FireIndex">{{cite web|url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/02/bushfires-and-climate/#more-654|title=Bushfires and extreme heat in southeast Australia|last=Karoly|first=David|date=16 February 2009|publisher=Real Climate|accessdate=17 February 2009}}</ref>

By midday wind speeds were reaching their peak, and by 12:30&nbsp;pm powerlines fell in Kilmore East due to the high winds. These sparked a bushfire that would later generate extensive [[pyrocumulus]] clouds, and become the largest, deadliest, and most intense firestorm ever experienced in Australia's post-European history. The overwhelming majority of fire activity occurred between midday and 7:00&nbsp;pm, when wind speed and temperature were at their highest, and humidity at its lowest.

===Injuries===
[[File:09 vic bushfire damage Steels Creek 01.JPG|thumb|Bushfire damage to property in [[Steels Creek, Victoria|Steels Creek]]]]
A total of 414 people were injured during the Black Saturday bushfires. Due to the intensity and speed of the fires, most casualties of the bushfires either died, or survived with minor injuries. There were significantly fewer major burns than in previous bushfires, such as [[Ash Wednesday fires|Ash Wednesday]]. Of the people who presented to medical treatment centres and hospitals, there were 22 with serious burns and 390 with minor burns and other bushfire-related injuries.<ref name="Australian Medical Journal">[http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/191_01_060709/cam10194_fm.html Australian Medical Journal] article abstract</ref>

National and statewide burns disaster plans were activated. Twenty-two patients with major burns presented to the state<U+2019>s burns referral centres, of which eighteen were adults. One patient admitted to the [[Royal Children's Hospital]] and two at [[The Alfred Hospital]] died from their injuries. Adult burns patients at The Alfred spent 48.7 hours in theatre in the first 72 hours. There were a further 390 bushfire-related presentations across the state in the first 72 hours. Most patients with serious burns were [[triage]]d to, and managed at, burns referral centres. Throughout the disaster, burns referral centres continued to have substantial surge capacity.<ref name="Australian Medical Journal" />

{{Main|Responses to the Black Saturday bushfire crisis}}
{{See also|International reaction to the 2009 Victorian bushfires}}
Responses to the Black Saturday bushfires included immediate community response, donations, and international aid efforts. Later responses included Government inquiries including a Royal Commission, and recommendations and discussions from a wide variety of bodies, organisations, authorities and communities.

In September 2009 it was announced that Australia's most prominent [[fire ecology|fire ecologist]], Kevin Tolhurst, was developing a new course for the [[University of Melbourne]] on fire behaviour.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Costigan | first = Justine | title = Responding to Tragedy | work = Melbourne University Magazine |date = September 2009| pages = 15<U+2013>17 | url = http://mag.alumni.unimelb.edu.au/major-feature/responding-tragedy | accessdate = 3 September 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Later that month the [[City of Manningham]] announced it was developing the state's first integrated fire management plan in conjunction with the interim findings of the Royal Commission.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Crowe | first = Danielle | title = Hotspots register | work = Manningham Leader | date = 9 September 2009 | page = 5 | url = http://manningham-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/pilot-project-manningham-council-is-mapping-our-fire-hotspots/ | accessdate = 22 September 2009}}</ref> It is expected that eventually all Victorian councils responsible for both urban and rural land will need to develop such plans, which define fire risks in [[Landscape|open space]] areas, along major roads, and in parkland.

In September/October 2009, it was announced that a new fire hazard system would replace the previous one. The new system involves a six-tier scale to indicating such things as the level of risk and activity of the fire. This standardised ''[[Bushfires in Australia#Warnings|Fire Danger Rating]]'' (FDR) was subsequently adopted by all Australian states in late 2009. Every day during the fire season the [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)]] forecasts an outlook of the ''Fire Danger Index'' (FDI) by considering the predicted weather including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and dryness of vegetation.<ref name="Country Fire Authority">{{cite web |url=http://www.cfaconnect.net.au/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=873 |title=New Warning System Explained |publisher=[[Country Fire Authority]] |accessdate=1 February 2010}}</ref> On the highest risk days, residents are advised to leave the potentially affected areas.

The [[RSPCA Australia|RSPCA]] estimated that over a million animals perished in the bushfires.<ref name=age-4.4bill /> Additionally, many of the surviving [[Fauna of Australia|wildlife]] suffered from severe burns. For example, large numbers of [[kangaroo]]s were afflicted with burned feet due to territorial instincts that drew them back to their recently burned and smouldering home ranges.<ref name="AP-2009Feb11-Animals">{{cite news| last = Gelineau | first = Kristen | title = Millions of animals dead in Australia fires | agency = Associated Press | date = 11 February 2009 | url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hn9MswZT1UDQOM4JFexha4JktfeQD969HIS80 | accessdate = 11 February 2009 }}{{Dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref> The affected area, particularly around Marysville, contains the only known habitat of [[Leadbeater's Possum]], Victoria's faunal emblem,<ref>[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=95950 Last captive Leadbeater's possum dies]. ninemsn.com.au. 15 April 2006.</ref> putting this species under further threat.

Forested [[drainage basin|catchment areas]] supplying five of Melbourne's nine major dams were affected by the fires, with the worst affected being the [[Maroondah Reservoir]] and [[O'Shannassy Reservoir]].<ref name="age dash save water">{{Cite news| last = Ker | first = Peter | title = Dash to save Melbourne's drinking water | publisher = The Age | date = 17 February 2009 | url = http://www.theage.com.au/national/dash-to-save-melbournes-drinking-water-20090217-89wm.html | accessdate = 17 February 2009}}</ref> As of 17 February 2009, over ten billion litres of water had been shifted out of affected dams into others.<ref name="age dash save water" /> A [[Melbourne Water]] spokesperson said that affected dams may need to be decommissioned if the contamination from ash and other material were serious enough, and also said that forest regrowth in the burnt-out catchment areas could reduce runoff yields by up to 30% over the next three decades.<ref name="age dash save water" /><ref>{{Cite news| last = Roberts | first = Greg | title = Vic bushfires may affect water supplies | newspaper = The Age | date = 17 February 2009 | url = http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-national/vic-bushfires-may-affect-water-supplies-20090217-89zb.html | accessdate = 14 December 2009 | location=Melbourne}}</ref>

In early March 2009, smoke from the fires was discovered in the atmosphere over Antarctica at record altitudes.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Bushfire aftermath: smoke trapped over Antarctica | location = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 28 May 2009 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/05/28/2583676.htm | accessdate = 14 December 2009}}</ref>

===Climate change===
[[File:2009 Lake Mountain after bushfire DSC 0335.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lake Mountain]] toboggan run two months after the bushfires]]
While it is difficult to attribute an individual weather event, such as the current extended drought in southeastern Australia, to an overall climatic pattern such as [[global warming]], it is possible to correlate patterns with other patterns. Although the current drought could be the result of natural weather pattern variability, it is embedded in a 50-year warming trend that a number of experts attribute to human-induced increases in [[greenhouse gas emissions]],.<ref name=CSIROFAQ>{{cite web| title = Q&A: Victorian bushfires (fact sheet) | publisher = CSIRO | date = 12 February 2009 | url = http://www.csiro.au/resources/Victorian-Bushfires-QA.html#9 | accessdate =18 February 2009}}</ref><ref name=BryanWalshTime>{{Cite news| last = Walsh | first = Bryan  | title = Why Global Warming May Be Fueling Australia's Fires | publisher = Time | date = 9 February 2009 | url = http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1878220,00.html?imw=Y | accessdate = 12 February 2009}}</ref>

This warming trend is, in turn, expected to continue. A proportionate and consequential increase in the intensity and frequency of Australian fires is forecast.<ref name=CSIROFAQ/><ref name=BryanWalshTime /> Following the fires, commentators such as noted scientist [[Tim Flannery]],<ref name="Flannery Australian bushfires">{{Cite news|title = Australian bushfires: when two degrees is the difference between life and death |publisher = Guardian |date = 10 February 2009 |url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/feb/10/australia-bush-fires |accessdate = 18 February 2009 | location=London | first=Tim | last=Flannery}}</ref> [[Australian Greens]] leader [[Bob Brown]],<ref name=BryanWalshTime /> and leading and volunteer firefighters<ref name=firefightersunion /><ref name="glw firefighter" /> argued that the number of extreme fire days in Australia is likely to increase substantially due to [[climate change]], and that governments should therefore invest more in reducing emissions. A study by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the [[CSIRO]] which forecast that the risk of extreme fire-weather is likely to increase substantially throughout southeast Australia by 2050 was cited in support.<ref name="Fire-weather" />

A more recent report by [[Greenpeace]] and a state firefighters union predicted that "mega-fires" could occur once every three years in the bush around Melbourne.<ref>{{Cite news| author = Adair, Kieran | title = Firefighters warn of climate risk | work = Green Left Weekly | issue = 826 | date = 17 February 2010 | page = 3 | url = http://www.greenleft.org.au/2010/826/42495 | accessdate = 19 February 2010}}</ref> A month after its release the [[United Firefighters Union of Australia]] issued an [[open letter]] to the Prime Minister and Premier Brumby which stated that "we are well on the way to guaranteeing that somewhere in the country there will be an almost annual repeat of the recent disaster", and pleaded for emissions to be halved by 2020.<ref>{{cite web| title = An open letter from the United Firefighters Union of Australia to the Australian Prime Minister and Victorian Premier | publisher = [[United Firefighters Union of Australia]] | date = 11 March 2010 | url = http://www.ufua.asn.au/267.html | accessdate = 20 April 2010 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5p6oePPnL | archivedate = 20 April 2010}}</ref>

A study completed after the bushfires by the [[CSIRO]] found that the [[Indian Ocean Dipole]] was at least partially to blame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/health/australias-killer-bushfires-have-their-origins-in-indian-ocean_100170955.html|title=Australias killer bushfires have their origins in Indian Ocean|publisher=Thaindian News|accessdate=22 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/news/Indian-Ocean-Temp-And-Bushfire.html|title=Indian Ocean temperature link to bushfires|publisher=CSIRO|accessdate=22 November 2009}}</ref> It was determined that the phenomenon was also a factor in the extended drought that Australia suffered for many years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/02/05/2482667.htm|title=Indian Ocean driving Australia's big dry: study|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=22 November 2009}}</ref> and as this was a contributing factor in establishing the favourable fire conditions, it added further support to the contention that the dipole was an important factor in the fires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.science.unsw.edu.au/news/indian-ocean-drought|title=Indian Ocean causes Big Dry: drought mystery solved|publisher=University of New South Wales, Faculty of Science|accessdate=22 November 2009}}</ref>

===Economic impact===
[[File:Kinglake aerial.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the Kinglake area looking north, nine months after bushfires (burnt area top third of image)]]
The Bushfires Royal Commission gave a "conservative" estimate of the total cost of the Black Saturday bushfires of A$4.4 billion. This figure included a value of $645 million placed on the 173 lives lost using an accepted method the government uses to value lives, however did not include any assessment of the cost of the injuries received.<ref name=age-4.4bill>{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Darren|title=Black Saturday cost $4.4 billion|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/black-saturday-cost-44-billion-20100801-11116.html|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=15 February 2011|date=1 August 2010|location=Melbourne}}</ref> 

The largest contributor to the total cost was insurance claims, which the Insurance Council of Australia reported as $1.2 billion as of August 2010. This figure was composed of 84 per cent for property or contents, and 16 per cent for vehicles. However the report also estimated that up to 13 per cent of residential properties destroyed may have had no insurance, with many more under-insured, thus suggesting that the actual cost of asset damage in the bushfires was considerably higher than that recorded. The report from the commission said that: "...&nbsp;the level of insurance claims is likely to underestimate the true extent of property losses, but it is unable to calculate the extent of this underestimation".<ref name=age-4.4bill />

Also omitted from the $4.4 billion figure were the agricultural losses sustained in the fires, and the ongoing impacts on agriculture in following seasons. The Victorian Department of Primary Industries estimated losses shortly after the fires as 11,800 head of livestock, {{convert|62000|ha|acres}} of grazing [[pasture]], and {{Convert|32000|t|ton}} of [[hay]] and [[silage]].<ref name=age-4.4bill />

As of February 2011, two years after the fires, the ''Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority'' stated that based on figures from the end of 2010, permits had been issued for the rebuilding of only 731 of the 1,795, or 41 per cent of the principal places of residence destroyed in the fires.<ref name=age-slowpath>{{cite news|last=Johanson|first=Simon|title=Recovery a painfully slow path|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/recovery-a-painfully-slow-path-20110206-1aigz.html|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=15 February 2011|date=7 February 2011|location=Melbourne}}</ref>

====Lawsuits====
A [[class action]] lawsuit was initiated in the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]] on 13 February by [[Slidders Lawyers]] against electricity distribution company [http://www.sp-ausnet.com.au/ SP AusNet], in relation to the [[Kilmore East, Victoria|Kilmore East]] fire that became part of the Kinglake complex, and the [[Beechworth, Victoria|Beechworth]] fires.<ref name="age class action">{{Cite news| author = Houston, Cameron & Bachelard, Michael | title = Huge fire class action launched | publisher = The Age | date = 15 February 2009 | url = http://www.theage.com.au/national/huge-fire-class-action-launched-20090214-87pg.html?page=-1 | accessdate = 15 February 2009 | location=Melbourne}}</ref> A partner at the firm indicated that the claim would centre on alleged [[negligence]] by SP AusNet in its management of electricity infrastructure.<ref name="age class action" /> On 12 February police had taken away a section of power line as well as a power pole from near [[Kilmore East, Victoria|Kilmore East]], part of a two-kilometre section of line that fell on the morning of 7 February and was believed to have started the fire there.<ref name="age class action" />

A separate class action claim was expected to be commenced by [[Gadens Lawyers]] some time after 16 February, and [[Slater & Gordon]] indicated that they were awaiting the report of the to-be-established [[Royal Commission]], expected in late 2010, before initiating any claims.<ref name="age class action" />

Also on 13 February, five law firms from Victoria's Western Districts held a meeting to discuss a potential class action in relation to the [[Horsham]] fire, which was also thought to have been started by fallen power lines.<ref name="age class action" />

Over 600 bushfire victims signed up for a class action lawsuit against [[Singapore Power]], majority shareholder of SP Ausnet. The action alleges the power company failed to fit a $10 protective device on the power line, which contributed to it breaking and starting the devastating Kilmore East/Kinglake fire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/1072983/hundreds-sign-for-bushfire-class-action |title=Hundreds sign for bushfire class action |date=June 19m 2010 |work=[[Ninemsn]] |accessdate=16 June 2010}}</ref>

===Fire policy===
[[File:09 vic bushfire damage Yarra Glen 02.JPG|thumb|right|Yarra Glen three days after the fires showing differential property survival]]
In the wake of the fires, and the mounting casualty toll, there was debate about policies for dealing with bushfires and the management practices that may have contributed to them. Naomi Brown, chief executive of the ''Australasian Fire and Emergency Services Authorities Council'', argued that the high number of fatalities in these fires, as opposed to earlier fires such as the [[Ash Wednesday fires]], was partly attributable to increased population densities on Melbourne's fringes.<ref name="age strategies questioned" /> David Packham, bushfire expert and research fellow at [[Monash University]], argued that high fuel loads in bushland led to the destructive intensity of the fires, saying that "There has been total mismanagement of the Australian forest environment".<ref name="age strategies questioned">{{Cite news| last = Rood | first = David | title = Forest strategies questioned | publisher = The Age | date = 10 February 2009 | url = http://www.theage.com.au/national/forest-strategies-questioned-20090209-82d7.html?page=-1 | accessdate = 10 February 2009 | location=Melbourne}}</ref> 

In announcing that the fires would be investigated by a [[Royal Commission]], [[Premier of Victoria|Victorian Premier]] [[John Brumby]] suggested that the long-standing 'stay-and-defend-or-leave-early' policy would be reviewed, saying that while it had proven reliable during normal conditions, the conditions on 7&nbsp;February had been exceptional.<ref name="australian nsw commissioner policy">{{Cite news| title = Stay-at-home policy best, says NSW fire commissioner | publisher = The Australian | date = 9 February 2009 | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25032778-5006784,00.html | accessdate = 10 February 2009 | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Brumby said that "There were many people who had done all of the preparations, had the best fire plans in the world and tragically it didn't save them."<ref name="age strategies questioned" /> 

Commissioner Nixon, however, defended the policy, saying that it was "well thought of and well based and has stood the test of time and we support it".<ref name="abc nixon defends policy">{{Cite news| title = Nixon defends fire policy | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 9 February 2009 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/02/09/2486729.htm | accessdate = 10 February 2009}}</ref> Similarly, Commissioner of the [[New South Wales Rural Fire Service]], Shane Fitzsimmons, said that "Decades of science, practice and history show that a well-prepared home provides the best refuge in the event of fire".<ref name="australian nsw commissioner policy" /> Nixon also dismissed potential policies involving forced evacuations, saying "There used to be policies where you could make people leave but we're talking about adults".<ref name="abc nixon defends policy" /> Former Victorian police minister [[Pat McNamara (politician)|Pat McNamara]] argued that forced evacuations could have worsened the death toll, as many of the dead appeared to have been killed while attempting to evacuate the fire areas by car.<ref name="age strategies questioned" />

===Building codes===
In response to the Black Saturday bushfires new building regulations for Victorian bushfire-prone areas were fast tracked by Standards Australia.<ref name="StandardsUpdate">{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/victoria-looks-at-changes-to-building-standards-20090215-887t.html?skin=text-only|title=Victoria looks at changes to building standards|date=16 February 2009|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=15 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.standards.org.au/downloads/091002_Bushfire_Standard_Statement_FINAL.pdf| title= Media Release - Standards Australia to fast track completion of bushfire Standard | publisher=Standards Australia | accessdate=17 February 2009 | date=11 February 2009 }}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref> Through the ''Department of Planning and Community Development'' the Victorian government has published a range of new guidelines and standards for bushfire planning and building.<ref name=dpcd-bpb>{{cite web|title=Bushfire planning and building|url=http://www.dpcd.vic.gov.au/planning/planning-policy-and-projects/bushfire-planning-and-building-resource|work=Department of Planning and Community Development official website|publisher=State Government of Victoria|accessdate=22 April 2011|date=1 April 2011}}</ref> 

Based on this information, the ''Building Commission Victoria'' has released a range of publications to assist with people returning to properties, moving into temporary dwellings, [[retrofitting]] existing dwellings, and building new dwellings in bushfire areas.<ref name=pfs-bcv>{{cite web|title=Publications and Fact Sheets|url=http://www.buildingcommission.com.au/www/html/2436-publications-and-fact-sheets.asp|work=Official website|publisher=Building Commission Victoria|accessdate=22 April 2011|date=19 November 2010}}</ref> The new standard states that all properties (not just those in bushfire areas) will now require a "bushfire attack assessment", and will be given a Bushfire Attack Level (BAL) rating that outlines the type of construction required. The BAL takes into consideration such factors as the [[McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index|Fire Danger Index]], the slope, and surrounding vegetation. BALs range from "BAL-LOW", for properties with no specific construction requirements such as suburban buildings, to "BAL-FZ" for properties in the fire zone likely to experience direct exposure to the fire front, as well as high heat flux and ember attacks.<ref name=gtbab-bcv>{{cite web|title=A guide to building in Victoria after bushfires|url=http://www.buildingcommission.com.au/resources/documents/guide_to_building_after_bushfires_March10.pdf|work=Official website|publisher=Building Commission Victoria|accessdate=22 April 2011|date=19 November 2010}}</ref>

While a draft national building code for bushfire-prone areas proposed using {{convert|1000|K|C F|lk=on}} as the standard for the assumed temperature to which houses are subject when hit by bushfire, fire engineers argued that standards should be based on a {{convert|1090|K|C F}} temperature. This was in line with existing New South Wales building laws for bushfire-prone areas, although the temperature of fires can actually peak at approximately {{convert|1600|K|C F}}.<ref name="BuildingCodes">{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/foolhardy-to-set-building-code-that-underestimates-heat-of-fires-20090211-84r4.html?page=-1|title='Foolhardy' to set building code that underestimates heat of fires|date=12 February 2009|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=14 February 2009 | first=Debra | last=Jopson}}</ref> The ''Australian Building Codes Board'' incorporated the {{convert|1090|K|C F}} temperature in the standard, with the support of the CFA and [[Australasian Fire Authorities Council]].<ref name=gtbab-bcv />

====Banning housing in highest risk areas====
As part of the building codes debate, an expert panel recommended in 2010 that the state government ban housing in the highest fire risk areas, which are some of the most dangerous in the world.<ref name=aust-ban-dev>{{cite web |last=Rintoul |first=Stuart |title=Ban development in fire-prone areas, experts tell royal commission |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/ban-development-in-fire-prone-areas-experts-tell-royal-commission/story-e6frg6nf-1225830521084 |work=[[The Australian]]|publisher=[[News Limited]]|accessdate=19 February 2011|date=15 February 2010}}</ref> Professor Michael Buxton of [[RMIT University]] said that after the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires the government bought back tens of thousands of lots across the [[Dandenong Ranges]] because they were in extremely high fire risk areas; he backed another similar large-scale buyback scheme to move people away from unacceptably high risk areas.<ref name=aust-ban-dev />
 
Another member of the panel, international planning expert Professor Roz Hansen, said she was "disappointed and alarmed" about the decision to rebuild Marysville, stating that it was unlikely that a new development would have been permitted in the area. She further went on to say that in parts of Asia people had been forcibly moved out of unacceptably high risk cyclone and flooding areas in the public interest, despite the difficulties this involved.<ref name=abc-norebuild>{{cite web|last=Cowan|first=Jane|title=Marysville should never have been rebuilt, commission told|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/02/15/2819672.htm|work=ABC News|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=19 February 2011|date=15 February 2010}}</ref>
