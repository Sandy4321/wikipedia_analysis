'''Jetstar Airways''' is a an Australian [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airline]] headquartered in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], [[Australia]].<ref>"[http://www.jetstar.com/au/en/contact-us/corporate-addresses.aspx Corporate addresses]." Jetstar Airways. Retrieved on 12 August 2009.</ref> It is a subsidiary of [[Qantas]], created in response to the threat posed by low-cost airline [[Virgin Blue Airlines]]. The airline operates an extensive domestic network as well as regional and international services from its main base at [[Melbourne Airport]],<ref name="FI">{{cite news | title= Directory: World Airlines | work= [[Flight International]] | page= 98 | date= 2007-04-03}}</ref> using a mixed fleet of narrow- and wide-body jet liners. Parent company Qantas also has stakes in sister companies [[Jetstar Asia Airways]] and [[Valuair]] in [[Singapore]] (via its stake in [[Orange Star]]); and [[Jetstar Pacific Airlines]] in [[Vietnam]].

==History==
The airline was established by Qantas in 2003 as a low-cost domestic subsidiary. Qantas had previously acquired [[Impulse Airlines]] and operated it under the [[QantasLink]] brand from 2001 onwards, but following the decision to launch a LCC, re-launched the airline under the Jetstar brand.<ref name="FI"/> Domestic passenger services began on 25 May 2004, soon after the sale of tickets for her inaugural flight in February 2004. International services to [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]], commenced on 1 December 2005. Although owned by Qantas, its management operates largely independent of Qantas through the company formerly known as Impulse Airlines - an airline acquired by Qantas on 20 November 2001. Other International services started in 2005.

Despite its low-cost ethos, Jetstar currently offers a limited number of connecting services without through baggage checking&nbsp;<U+2014> though this has changed since international flights commenced in November 2006 when baggage connectivity and connecting services were added as a service offering for domestic flights connecting with international flights only.

Reserved seating is currently provided on all routes and on 4 October 2006, Jetstar became the first Australian airline to allow customers to select their seat upon booking.<ref>{{cite press release | publisher = Jetstar Airways | date = 19 June 2006 | title = Jetstar to move to allocated seating | url=http://www.jetstar.com/pdf/news/20060619a.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

The first flight of sister airline Jetstar Asia Airways took off from its Singapore hub to [[Hong Kong]] on 13 December 2004. This marked Qantas' entry into the Asian low-cost market and signified its intention to battle key competitor [[Singapore Airlines]] on its home ground. Qantas has a 42.5% stake in Jetstar Asia's ownership.

On 1 December 2003, when Qantas Airways Ltd announced this new low-cost carrier there was a virtual airline named Jetstar International Airlines already in existence, complete with a web site. As part of their startup promotion, Qantas sold 100,000 airline tickets for $29, and the virtual airline's web site was swamped with would-be customers, job-seekers, and prospective vendors. The virtual airline sued Qantas, claiming Copyright Infringement, Trademark Infringement, Illegal Cybersquatting, Conversion and Lanham Act Unfair Competition in United States District Court. Qantas settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.<ref>{{cite article | publisher = Fly Away Simulations | date = 22 April 2003 | title = Jetstar Virtual Airline Sues Qantas Over Trademark Infringement | url=http://flyawaysimulation.com/article851.html}}</ref>

On 1 December 2005, Jetstar commenced operations from [[Sydney]], Melbourne, [[Brisbane]] and the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] to [[Christchurch]] in [[New Zealand]]. On 7 December 2005, it was announced that Jetstar would establish the world's first global low cost airline flying initially to destinations within ten hours flying time of Australia but later to operate to [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]]. At the end of 2005, it was announced that Jetstar would fly to [[Perth, Western Australia]] from Melbourne's [[Avalon Airport]].

In July 2006, Jetstar and Jetstar Asia were brought together under the Jetstar brand.<ref>{{cite press release | publisher = Jetstar Airways | date = 26 July 2006 | title = Jetstar move to single brand and distribution approach to support growth in Asia | url=http://www.jetstar.com/pdf/news/20060726d.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>  Jetstar, Jetstar Asia and Valuair customers now make all online bookings through Jetstar.com.

In July 2007, Qantas acquired a 18% stake in Vietnam's [[Pacific Airlines]], to increase to 30% by 2010. The airline was relaunched on 23 May 2008 as Jetstar Pacific.

On 1 August 2008 Jetstar announced that it had signed an agreement with the [[Northern Territory]] Government to make [[Darwin International Airport]] an international hub with plans for seven aircraft to be based in Darwin. Under the agreement Jetstar would be required to be base three aircraft at Darwin by June 2009 with a further four by June 2012 with the Territory Government provide AU$5 million to set up the hub and a further AU$3 million for promotion of the new routes.<ref>{{cite news | publisher = Northern Territory News | date = 2008-08-02 | title = Jetstar wings in for Darwin hub  | url=http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2008/08/02/4930_ntnews.html}}</ref>

On 28 April 2009, Jetstar commenced daily direct services from Auckland to Gold Coast and Sydney. On 10 June the same year Jetstar commenced domestic New Zealand flights between Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Queenstown. Jetstar replaced [[Jetconnect]] on these routes using Airbus A320 aircraft.

* [[Noum<U+00E9>a]]

Recently, with the latest ordering of a fifth additional Airbus A330, there has been a greater impetus for the expansion to occur soon, particularly with [[Air Asia X]] taking market share on the low-cost Australia to Europe market.<ref>http://www.news.com.au/travel/story/0,28318,25955615-5014090,00.html</ref> The action to implement these, or other similar routes are therefore more likely to occur in the business climate and with these action taken by the business.

==Marketing and sponsorship==
From 2004-2006, the airline's former mascot, ''Julie The Jetstar Girl'' was played by actress [[Magda Szubanski]].

The advertising [[slogan]] of Jetstar is "All day every day low fares".  Two additional slogans have recently been used in its marketing campaigns; "Let's Fly Jetstar" (2004<U+2013>2006) & "It's All About Choice / Fly Away" (later "Low Fares, Good Times") (1 July 2006<U+2013>future)

In 2007, Jetstar won the low-cost carrier section of the Skytrax World Airline Awards.<ref>[http://www.worldairlineawards.com/Awards_2007/Lowcost.htm Jetstar wins Best Low-Cost Airline Award for 2007]</ref>

Jetstar Airways is the major sponsor of the [[National Rugby League]] team, the [[Gold Coast Titans]].<ref>[http://www.titans.com.au/index.php?page_id=55 "It's the Jetstar Gold Coast Titans" - Gold Coast Titans Media Release] retrieved 22 January 2009.</ref>

In July 2008 Jetstar Airways was named the Official Airline of the [[Australian national rugby league team]]. One of its A320s was decorated with special decals to advertise the relationship.<ref>[http://www.jetstar.com/~/media/files/pdf/news/2008/jul/080716.ashx "Australian Kangaroos coach and captain launch Jetstar partnership, <U+2018>Go Roos<U+2019> aircraft and ''PlayJetstarRugbyLeague.com''" - Jetstar Media Release] retrieved 22 January 2009.</ref>

Jetstar sponsorship logos appears at the credits for [[Channel Seven]] game show ''Deal Or No Deal'' under the banner of ''We choose to fly...''. They use it for two of [[Channel Seven]]'s programs ''Sunrise/Weekend Sunrise'' & ''The Morning Show'', under the banner of ''Travel Partner...''.

==Inflight service==
On all domestic routes Jetstar has a [[buy on board]] single class service offering food and drinks for purchase.<ref>"[http://www.jetstar.com/~/media/files/pdf/nz/jetshopcafe.pdf Jetshop.cafe]." ''Jetstar Airways''. Accessed 21 December 2008.</ref>

On all A330 international routes, Jetstar offers a two-class service.

'''StarClass'''

Jetstar offers StarClass on its A330-200 aircraft. The StarClass cabin is fitted with 38 leather premium class seats in a 2-3-2 configuration, similar to Qantas domestic Business Class. The service is inclusive of all meals and beverages, in-flight entertainment, International Qantas Club access where available, and includes an increased baggage allowance of 30&nbsp;kg.

'''Economy Class'''

Jetstar offers either pre-purchased meals on board or buy on board service with food and beverages.  Portable in-flight entertainment devices are available for an extra fee.

== Controversies ==

On 14 November 2009, Jetstar passenger Paralympian [[Kurt Fearnley]] was involved in a well publicised confrontation with Jetstar. When asked to check-in his wheelchair and transfer to an attendant propelled chair at check-in, rather than the preferred practice of transferring only at the gate, Fearnley refused to give up his independence and crawled through the terminal instead.<ref>http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/296066,wheelchair-banned--paralympian-crawls-through-australian-airport.html</ref> 

Again in November 2009, Jetstar came under more scrutiny after they refused to book a [[guide dog]] of a visually impaired couple. Jetstar later apologised for the incident and blamed it on a break down in communications.<ref>{{cite news | publisher = The Australian | date = 2008-08-02 | title = Jetstar refuses to allow guide dog on flight | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/travel/news/jetstar-denies-guide-dog-on-flight/story-e6frg8ro-1225806610668}}</ref>

On 15 December 2009, Jetstar passenger Mesha Sendyk was denied boarding for requesting a gate attendant not to be rude, after he challenged her over the size of her carry-on bag (which after checking met the airline's specifications). She eventually flew on another airline at her own additional cost. After she wrote a letter of complaint, Jetstar's customer care manager Michael Mirabito threatened her with a total ban from the airline's services.<ref>{{cite news | publisher = The Sydney Morning Herald | date = 2009-12-15 | title = Flying off the handle: a day with the Dalai Lama, a night with Jetstar | url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-news/flying-off-the-handle-a-day-with-the-dalai-lama-a-night-with-jetstar-20091215-kszu.html}}</ref><ref>http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-news/incident-report-20091215-ksvn.html</ref>

==Incidents==

* On 10 June 2009, Jetstar Flight 20 flying from [[Kansai International Airport]] to [[Gold Coast Airport]] experienced a fire in the cockpit apparently caused by a fault in the [[windshield]] electric heating system. The fire was extinguished by the pilots who subsequently diverted the plane to [[Guam International Airport]]. None of the 203 passengers and crew on board were harmed in the incident. Jetstar and the [[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]] are currently examining the full cause of the fire.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-news/emergency-landing-fire-on-board-jetstar-flight-to-gold-coast-20090611-c3vp.html Emergency landing: fire on board Jetstar flight to Gold Coast - Travel - smh.com.au<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref>

==Television series==
:{{main|Going Places (Australian TV series)}}
The [[Nine Network]] began airing the series ''[[Going Places (Australian TV series)|Going Places]]'' from October 2007. The eight-part series depicted the everyday lives of selected members of Jetstar's Sydney and Melbourne airport staff. The show followed the dramas of the check-in staff, mid-flight staff, and the induction program for new international recruits.
