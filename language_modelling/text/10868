'''Nancy Davis Reagan''' (born '''Anne Frances Robbins''' on [[July 6]], [[1921]]) is the widow of the former [[United States President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and was [[First Lady of the United States]] from 1981 to 1989. Born in [[New York]], her parents divorced soon after her birth; she grew up in [[Maryland]], living with an aunt and uncle while her mother pursued acting jobs.  As '''Nancy Davis''', she was an [[actress]] in the 1940s and 1950s, starring in films such as ''[[Donovan's Brain (film)|Donovan's Brain]]'', ''Night into Morning'', and ''[[Hellcats of the Navy]]''. She married Ronald Reagan in 1952, who was then president of the [[Screen Actor's Guild]]; they have two children. Nancy became the First Lady of California when Ronald Reagan was [[Governor of California]] from 1967 to 1975. 

She became the First Lady of the United States in January 1981 with Ronald Reagan's [[President of the United States|presidential]] victory, experiencing criticism early in her husband's first term due largely to her decision to replenish the [[China Room|White House china]]. She championed [[illegal drug|recreational drug prevention]] causes by founding the [[Just Say No|"Just Say No"]] drug awareness campaign, which was considered her major initiative as First Lady.  More controversy ensued when it was revealed in 1988 that she had consulted an [[astrologer]] to assist in planning the president's schedule after the [[Reagan Assassination Attempt|1981 assassination attempt]] on her husband's life.

The Reagans retired to their home in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel Air]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] in 1989. Nancy devoted most of her time to caring for her ailing husband, diagnosed in 1994 with [[Alzheimer's disease]], until his [[Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|death in 2004]]. As of 2007, Nancy Reagan has remained active in politics, particularly as relates to [[stem cell|stem-cell research]].

==Acting career==
[[Image:NRPOSE.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Nancy Davis poses for a publicity photo, 1950]]
Following her graduation, Davis held jobs in [[Chicago]] as a sales clerk in [[Marshall Field's]] department store and as a nurse's aide.<ref name= "First Lady Nancy Reagan"/> With the help of her mother's colleagues in theatre, including [[Zasu Pitts]], [[Walter Huston]], and [[Spencer Tracy]],<ref name="nyt-lw"/> she pursued a career as a professional actress.

Noted author [[Garry Wills]] believes that Davis was underrated as an actress overall, because her constrained part in ''Hellcats'' was her most widely seen performance.<ref name="cannon-gov"/> Davis  seems to have downplayed her Hollywood goals: MGM promotional material in 1949 said that her "greatest ambition" was to have a "successful happy marriage";<ref name="cannon-gov"/> decades later, in 1975, she would say, "I was never really a career woman but [became one] only because I hadn't found the man I wanted to marry. I couldn't sit around and do nothing, so I became an actress."<ref name="cannon-gov"/> Ronald Reagan biographer [[Lou Cannon]] nevertheless characterized her as a "reliable" and "solid" performer who held her own in performances with better-known actors.<ref name="cannon-gov"/> After her final film, she appeared in television dramas such as ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and ''[[The Tall Man (TV series)|The Tall Man]]'' until 1962, when she retired as an actress.<ref name= "The Films of Nancy Reagan">{{cite web |url= http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/nancy/films.asp |title= Nancy Reagan > Her Films |accessdate=2007-03-08 |publisher= Ronald Reagan Foundation}}</ref> During her career, she served on the board of directors of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] for nearly 10 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sag.org/history/presidents/reagan.html|title= Screen Actors Guild Presidents |accessdate=2007-03-08 |publisher= Screen Actors Guild}}</ref>

==Marriage and family==

During her career as an actress, Nancy Davis dated actors in Hollywood; she later called [[Clark Gable]], whom she dated briefly, the nicest of the stars she had met.<ref name="nyt-lw"/> On [[November 15]], [[1949]], she met Ronald Reagan,<ref name="cannon-gov-77">Cannon, Lou (2003), pp. 77<U+2013>78.</ref> who was then president of the Screen Actor's Guild.  Concerned that she would be confused with another actress of the same name who appeared on the [[Hollywood blacklist]], she contacted Reagan to help maintain her employment as a guild actress in Hollywood, and for assistance in having her name removed from the list.<ref name="nyt-lw"/> The two began dating and their relationship became publicly visible; one Hollywood press account described their nightclub-free times together as "the romance of a couple who have no vices."<ref name="cannon-gov-77"/> Ronald Reagan was skeptical about marriage, however, following his painful 1948 divorce from [[Jane Wyman]], and he still saw other women.<ref name="cannon-gov-77"/> He eventually proposed to Davis in the couple's favorite booth at the [[Beverly Hills]] restaurant [[Chasen's]].<ref name="cannon-gov-77"/> They married on [[March 4]], [[1952]]<U+2014>in a simple ceremony designed to avoid the press<ref name= "Little Brown Church">{{cite web |url= http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/golf/sns-ap-reagan-places,0,1844441.story?page=2|title= Noteworthy places in Reagan's life|accessdate=2007-04-11|date=[[2004-06-05]]|publisher=''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''}}</ref><U+2014>at the Little Brown Church in the [[San Fernando Valley]] of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].

The couple's first child, Patricia Ann Reagan (better known by her professional name, [[Patti Davis]]), was born on [[October 21]], [[1952]]. Their son, [[Ron Reagan|Ronald Prescott Reagan]], was born six years later, on [[May 20]]. Nancy Reagan is also stepmother to [[Michael Reagan]] and  the late [[Maureen Reagan]], the children of her husband's first marriage to Jane Wyman.

Nancy's relationship with her children was not always as close as that with her husband; she frequently quarreled with her biological children and her stepchildren. Her relationship with Patti was the most contentious; Patti flouted [[American conservatism]] and rebelled against her parents by joining the [[nuclear freeze|nuclear freeze movement]] and authoring many anti-Reagan books.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/reagan/peopleevents/pande05.html|title=The Reagan Children|last=Wolf|first=Julie|accessdate=2007-10-17 |date=2000 | publisher= PBS}}</ref> Nancy's disagreements with Michael were also shown publicly. In 1984, she was quoted on television as saying that the two were in an "estrangement right now". Michael responded that Nancy was trying to cover up for the fact she had not met his daughter, Ashley, who had been born nearly a year earlier.<ref>Reagan, Nancy (1989), pp. 148<U+2013>149</ref> They eventually made peace, however.

==First Lady of California, 1967&ndash;1975==
[[Image:Nancy Reagan as First Lady of California.jpg|thumb|right|Nancy as the First Lady of California]]
Reagan was First Lady of California during her husband's two terms as governor.

==On the campaign trail==
{{main|U.S. presidential election, 1976|U.S. presidential election, 1980}}
Governor Reagan's term ended in 1975, and he did not run for a third; instead, he met with advisors to discuss a possible bid for the [[President of the United States|presidency]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976]]. His advisors approved of the bid, but Reagan still needed to convince a reluctant Nancy.<ref>Benze, James G. (2005), p. 32</ref> Once she had approved, she contributed to his campaign by overseeing personnel, monitoring her husband's schedule, and occasionally providing [[press conference]]s.<ref name= "Benze, James G., Jr. (2005), p. 33"/> Reagan lost the 1976 Republican nomination to the incumbent President [[Gerald Ford]], but he ran again for the presidency in [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980]] and succeeded in winning the nomination and election. During this second campaign, Nancy's management of staff became more apparent.<ref name="Benze, James G., Jr. (2005), p. 33">Benze, James G., Jr. (2005), p. 33</ref> She arranged a meeting between feuding campaign staffers [[John Sears]] and [[Michael Deaver]] with her husband, which resulted in Deaver leaving the campaign and placing Sears in charge. After the Reagan camp lost the [[Iowa caucus]] and fell behind in [[New Hampshire]] polls, Nancy organized a second meeting and decided it was time to fire Sears and his associates; she gave Sears a copy of the press release announcing his dismissal.<ref name= "Benze, James G., Jr. (2005), p. 33"/>

===White House glamor===
Nancy Reagan became the First Lady of the United States when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as President in 1981. Early in her tenure as First Lady, Reagan stated her desire to create a home in the [[White House]]. Rather than use government funds to renovate and redecorate, she sought private donations.<ref name= "First Lady Nancy Reagan">{{cite web |url= http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=41 |title=First Lady Biography: Nancy Reagan|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher= National First Ladies Library}}</ref> Nancy drew controversy early on by announcing the purchase of 4,370 pieces of scarlet, cream and gold [[China Room|state china service]] for the White House at a cost of $210,399.<ref name= "WH China">{{cite web |url= http://www.lenox.com/cs/index.cfm?fuseaction=wh|title= "Lenox: White House"|accessdate=2007-06-02 |publisher= Lenox, Inc}}</ref> Although the china was paid for by private donations, some from the private Knapp Foundation, the purchase raised eyebrows, for it was ordered at a time when the nation was undergoing an [[Early 1980s recession|economic recession]].<ref>Klapthor, Margaret Brown (1999), p. 184</ref>

Another of Nancy Reagan's trademarks was her interest in fashion. After the presidencies of [[Gerald Ford]] (who favored the "Michigan Fight Song" over "[[Hail to the Chief]]") and [[Jimmy Carter]] (who dramatically reduced the formality of presidential functions), Nancy brought a [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]]-esque glamor back into the White House.<ref name= "Nancy's Closet">{{cite news |first= Kevin|last= West|title= Nancy's Closet|url=http://www.style.com/w/feat_story/090907/full_page.html|publisher= Style.com|accessdate=2007-10-20}}</ref> Her elegant fashions and wardrobe were also controversial subjects. Nancy favored the color red, calling it "a picker-upper," and wore it accordingly.<ref name= "Nancy's Closet"/>  She chose dresses and gowns made by luxury designers, including [[James Galanos]] and [[Oscar de la Renta]]; her 1981 Galanos inaugural gown was estimated to cost $10,000.<ref name= "Nancy's Closet"/>

This and her taste for splendor inspired the derogatory nickname "Queen Nancy".<ref name= "First Lady Nancy Reagan"/> In an attempt to deflect the criticism, she self-deprecatingly donned a [[baglady]] costume at the [[Gridiron Club|1982 Gridiron Dinner]] and sang "Second-Hand Clothes," mimicking the song "Second-Hand Rose".<ref name= "Husband's Past will shape Nancy Reagan's future">{{cite web |url= http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-06-13-nancy-reagan_x.htm|title= Husband's Past will shape Nancy Reagan |accessdate=2007-03-08 |publisher= ''USA Today''|date=[[2004-06-13]]|author=Page, Susan}}</ref>

===President Reagan's assassination attempt===
{{main|Reagan assassination attempt}}
On [[March 30]], [[1981]], President Reagan as well as Press Secretary [[James Brady]], Secret Service agent [[Timothy McCarthy]], and Washington Police Office [[Thomas Delahanty]] were shot as they left the [[Hilton Washington]] hotel. Nancy was alerted and arrived at [[George Washington University Hospital]] not long after the shooting took place.

[[Image:NRJUSTSAYNO.jpg|thumb|left|Reagan gives a speech at a "[[Just Say No]]" rally in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] in 1987.]]
Nancy Reagan launched the "[[Just Say No]]" drug awareness campaign in 1982, which was her primary project and major initiative as First Lady.<ref name= "First Lady Nancy Reagan"/> While visiting a school in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]], Reagan was asked by a schoolgirl what to do when offered [[illegal drug|drugs]]; Nancy's response was "Just say no."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1989/010489a.htm|title= Remarks at the Nancy Reagan Drug Abuse Center Benefit Dinner in Los Angeles, California|accessdate=2007-10-03 |publisher= Ronald Reagan Foundation |date= [[1989-01-04]] |quote= ...in Oakland where a schoolchild in an audience Nancy was addressing stood up and asked what she and her friends should say when someone offered them drugs.

She also appeared on television talk shows, recorded public service announcements, and wrote guest articles.<ref name= "First Lady Nancy Reagan"/>

In 1985, Nancy expanded the campaign to an international level by inviting the [[First Lady|First Ladies]] of various nations to the White House for a conference on drug abuse.<ref name="First Lady Nancy Reagan"/> On [[October 27]], [[1986]], President Reagan signed a drug enforcement bill into law, which granted $1.7 billion in funding to fight the crisis and ensured a mandatory minimum penalty for [[drug-related crime|drug offense]]s.<ref name="PBS Frontline">{{cite web |url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/cron/ | title= Thirty Years of America's Drug War | publisher = pbs.org | accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref> Although the bill was criticized by some, Nancy Reagan considered it a personal victory.<ref name= "First Lady Nancy Reagan"/> In 1988, she became the first First Lady invited to address the [[United Nations General Assembly]], where she spoke on international drug interdiction and [[trafficking]] laws.<ref name= "First Lady Nancy Reagan"/>

[[Image:NREAGANDRUG.jpg|thumb|Reagan hosts the First Ladies Conference on Drug Abuse at the White House, 1985]]
Critics of the "Just Say No" campaign and the American "[[War on Drugs]]" argued that the program  was too costly and questioned its purpose.<ref name="critics of just say no"/> Author Jeff Elliot states that the Reagan administration's synonymous use of the terms "drug use" and "drug abuse" was improper, referencing Dr. Michael Newcomb's claim that there is "no evidence that most people who experiment with drugs get hooked."<ref name="critics of just say no">{{cite web |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n5_v25/ai_13786316/pg_3|title= Just say nonsense - Nancy Reagan's drug education programs|accessdate=2007-10-10 |publisher= ''Washington Monthly''|date= May 1993|pages= 3|author=Elliott, Jeff}}</ref>

Nancy stated in her [[memoirs]], "I felt panicky every time [Ronald] left the White House,"<ref> Reagan, Nancy (1989), p. 21</ref> and made it her concern to know her husband's schedule: the events he would be attending, and with whom.<ref name= "First Lady Nancy Reagan"/> Eventually, this protectiveness led to her consulting an [[astrologer]], [[Joan Quigley]], who offered insight on which days were "good," "neutral," or should be avoided, which influenced her husband's [[White House]] schedule.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDF1030F93BA25750C0A966958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print|title=Stars and Strife|accessdate= 2007-11-16|date= [[March 18]], [[1990]]|publisher=''The New York Times''|author= Molly Ivins}}</ref> Days were color-coded according to the astrologer's advice to discern precisely which days and times would be optimal for the President's safety and success.<ref name= "First Lady Nancy Reagan"/> The [[White House Chief of Staff]], [[Donald Regan]], grew frustrated with this regimen, which created friction between he and the First Lady.

===Cold War===
In 1985, 1987, and 1988, while [[Cold War]] discussions took place regarding nuclear affairs between [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Leader]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and President Reagan, Nancy met with Gorbachev's wife, [[Raisa Gorbachev|Raisa]]. The two women usually had tea, and discussed differences between the [[USSR]] and the United States. Their relationship was anything but the friendly, diplomatic one between their husbands; Nancy found Raisa hard to converse with and somewhat shrewd.<ref name= "First Lady Nancy Reagan"/> Visiting the United States for the first time in 1987, Raisa irked Reagan with lectures on subjects ranging from architecture to socialism, reportedly prompting the American President's wife to quip, "Who does that dame think she is?"<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967592-1,00.html |publisher = ''Time'' Magazine| author = Chua-Eoan, Howard G. | title = "My Wife Is a Very Independent Lady" | date = [[June 6]], [[1988]] | accessdate = 2007-10-05}}</ref> Nancy had previously encouraged her husband to hold these "summit" conferences with Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev, and suggested they form a personal relationship beforehand.<ref name= "First Lady Nancy Reagan"/>

==Later life==
Though Nancy was a controversial First Lady, 56&nbsp;percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of her when her husband left office on [[January 20]], [[1989]], with 18&nbsp;percent having an unfavorable opinion and the balance not giving an opinion.<ref name= "Nancy Reagan's poll numbers">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/06/07/opinion/polls/main621632.shtml|title=A Look Back At The Polls|accessdate=2007-09-23|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|date=[[June 7]], [[2004]]|accessate=2007-10-14}}</ref>  Compared to fellow First Ladies when their husbands left office, Reagan's approval was higher than those of [[Rosalynn Carter]] and [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], however she was less popular than [[Barbara Bush]] and her disapproval rating was double that of Carter's.<ref name="Nancy Reagan's poll numbers"/>

===Activities===

In late 1989, the former First Lady established the Nancy Reagan Foundation, which aimed to continue to educate people about the dangers of substance abuse.<ref name= "Nancy Reagan">{{cite web |url=http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/nancy/nancy_bio.asp|title= Nancy Reagan: Her Life and Times|accessdate= 2007-05-12|publisher= Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation}}</ref> The Foundation teamed with the BEST Foundation For A Drug-Free Tomorrow in 1994, and developed the Nancy Reagan Afterschool Program. She continued to travel around the nation, speaking out against drug and alcohol abuse. After President Reagan revealed that he had been diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]] in 1994, she made herself his primary caregiver and became actively involved with the National Alzheimer's Association and its affiliate, the Ronald & Nancy Reagan Research Institute in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]].<ref name= "First Lady Nancy Reagan"/>
