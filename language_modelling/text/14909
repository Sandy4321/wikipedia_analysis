'''Hurricane Erin''' was the longest-lived hurricane in the [[2001 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The sixth tropical depression, fifth tropical storm, and first hurricane, Erin developed from a [[tropical wave]] on [[September 1]]. After strengthening to a 60&nbsp;mph  (95&nbsp;km/h) tropical storm as it moved to the west-northwest, [[wind shear]] weakened Erin and caused it to dissipate on [[September 5]]. The remnants re-organized into a tropical depression the next day, and Erin strengthened into a hurricane on [[September 9]] while moving northwestward. This was the latest date for the first hurricane of the season since [[Hurricane Diana (1984)|Hurricane Diana]] on [[September 10]], [[1984 Atlantic hurricane season|1984]].<ref name="hurdat">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2006|title=Hurdat Data for Tropical Cyclones 1851-2005|publisher=[[NOAA]]|accessdate=2006-11-06|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1851to2005_atl.txt}}</ref> Erin quickly intensified and reached peak winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h) later on September 9. At its closest approach, Erin passed 105&nbsp;miles (170&nbsp;km) east-northeast of [[Bermuda]] near peak intensity, and subsequently weakened as it turned to the east. A [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] turned Erin to the northeast, and after passing just east of [[Cape Race]], [[Newfoundland]] it became extratropical on [[September 15]]. The extratropical remnant continued northeastward and lost its identity near [[Greenland]] on [[September 17]].

Though it was initially predicted to pass within 15&nbsp;miles (24&nbsp;km) of Bermuda, Hurricane Erin caused little damage or effects on the island. Large swells from the hurricane produced rough surf and rip currents along the [[East Coast of the United States]]. In [[Newfoundland]], Erin dropped moderate amounts of rain and gusty winds, though no damage was reported. Throughout its path, Erin caused no casualties, no injuries, and minor damage.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Erin 2001 track.png}}
A [[tropical wave]] moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[August 30]]. It almost immediately displayed signs of [[tropical cyclone]] formation with the development of deep convection and curved [[rainband]]s. Organization continued, and late on the 30th [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak classifications]] began on the system.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Richard Pasch & Daniel Brown|year=2001|title=Hurricane Erin Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-11-05|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2001erin.html}}</ref> On [[August 31]], after passing well south of the [[Cape Verde]] islands, the system stopped its organization trend.<ref name="aug30two">{{cite web|author=Avila/Molleda|year=2001|title=August 30 Tropical Weather Outlook|publisher=NHC|Accessdate=2006-11-05|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-A/2001/Aug/2001083102.ABNT20}}</ref> Convection became sporadic,<ref name="tcr"/> and the system became poorly organized as it moved westward at 20&nbsp;mph (32&nbsp;km).

Located to the south of a mid-level [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]], the depression moved to the west-northwest. With weak to moderate upper-level [[wind shear]] over the system, the depression gradually organized, and intensified into Tropical Storm Erin on [[September 2]].<ref name="tcr"/> Though Erin had favorable upper-level outflow and developing convection, the inner core of the storm remained disorganized.<ref name="pasch6">{{cite web|author=Pasch|year=2001|title=Tropical Storm Erin Discussion Six|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-11-05|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2001/dis/al062001.discus.006.html}}</ref> The storm slowly strengthened, and attained an initial peak intensity of 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h) while located about 1150&nbsp;miles (1855&nbsp;km) east of the Lesser Antilles. Favorable conditions were expected to allow Erin to continue to strengthen to reach winds of 85&nbsp;mph (135&nbsp;km/h).<Ref name="stewart7">{{cite web|author=Stewart|year=2001|title=Tropical Storm Erin Discussion Seven|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-11-05|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2001/dis/al062001.discus.007.html}}</ref> However, an upper-level low to the northwest of Erin produced strong vertical shear over the storm, and Erin quickly weakened as the low-level circulation became exposed to the southwest of the deep convection. The shear slightly abated on [[September 4]], allowing Erin to briefly re-strengthen. However, the storm remained disorganized, and following an increase in southwesterly [[wind shear]] Erin began a weakening trend. On [[September 5]], Erin weakened to a tropical depression, and hours later the low-level circulation dissipated.<ref name="tcr"/>

The depression moved to the north-northeast, then turned to the north-northwest, and regained tropical storm status on [[September 7]].

Shortly after reaching its peak intensity, Erin passed 105&nbsp;miles (170&nbsp;km) east-northeast of [[Bermuda]], its closest approach to the island. The hurricane maintained peak strength for 18&nbsp;hours before slowly weakening. Its weakening trend was slower than usual due to warmer than usual water temperatures, and by late on [[September 10]] Erin weakenend to a [[Category 2]] hurricane. Multiple short-wave [[trough (meteorology)|troughs]] weakened the western portion of the subtropical ridge, and on [[September 11]] Erin decelerated as it turned to the east. A strengthening mid- to upper-level trough over eastern [[Canada]] turned the hurricane to the northeast. It gradually accelerated its forward motion, and on [[September 15]], after weakening to a strong tropical storm, Erin passed just east of [[Cape Race]], [[Newfoundland]].<ref name="tcr"/> Convection gradually diminished as it moved through the north [[Atlantic Ocean]],<ref name="erin51">{{cite web|author=Jarvinen|year=2001|title=Tropical Storm Erin Discussion Fifty-One|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-11-05|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2001/dis/al062001.discus.051.html}}</ref> and later on September 15 Erin became [[extratropical]]. The extratropical storm continued northeastward, and after crossing over southern [[Greenland]] Erin merged with a high-latitude cyclonic flow to the east of Greenland on [[September 17]].<ref name="tcr"/>

==Impact and preparations==
When the hurricane appeared to pose a threat to [[Bermuda]], its government issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watch]]. Around 24&nbsp;hours before Erin made its closest approach, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning.<ref name="tcr"/> Initial forecasts indicated Erin would pass within 15&nbsp;miles (24&nbsp;km) of the island. As a result, ferry and bus transport was suspended. Officials prepared a school to be used as an emergency shelter, though few people used it.<ref name="bermy2">{{cite web|author=Matthew Taylor|year=2001|title=Hurricane Erin Spares Bermuda|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2006-11-06|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=27035233&firstvisit=true&currentResult=1&currentPage=0}}</ref>

The storm produced rainfall on the island, yet no flooding was reported.<ref name="apberm"/> Little structual damage occurred on Bermuda, and there were no reported injuries or casualties.<ref name="rg"/>

Swells from Erin produced rip currents along the [[North Carolina]] coastline.

Erin produced moderate winds across [[Newfoundland]], including a maximum sustained wind report of 53&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h) with a gust of 67&nbsp;mph (108&nbsp;km/h) at [[Cape Race]]. The storm also produced moderate amounts of precipitation, peaking at 5.1&nbsp;inches (131&nbsp;mm) at [[Sagona Island]].<ref name="tcr"/> Along the coast, the passage of the storm led to wave heights of up to 30&nbsp;feet (9.3&nbsp;m), while offshore a buoy recorded a wave height of 47&nbsp;feet (14.2&nbsp;m).
