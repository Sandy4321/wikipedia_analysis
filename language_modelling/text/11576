A '''constitutional referendum''' will be held in [[Croatia]] on 1 December 2013. The proposed amendments to the [[Constitution of Croatia|constitution]] would define marriage as being between a man and a woman, resulting in [[same-sex marriage]] being banned.<ref name=BBC>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24873498 Croatia to hold referendum on same-sex marriage ban] BBC News, 8 November 2013</ref>

==Background==
A petition in favour of the change organised by a [[Catholicism|Catholic]] group 'In the Name of the Family' had collected over 700,000 signatures in May 2013. The referendum was approved following a vote in the [[Parliament of Croatia|Sabor]] on 8 November in which 104 of the 151 MPs voted in favour of the proposed changes to the constitution.<ref name=BBC/>

Voters will be asked the question "Do you agree that marriage is matrimony between a man and a woman?"<ref name=BBC/>

==Campaign==
Prime Minister [[Zoran Milanovi<U+0107>]] told [[Croatian Radiotelevision|HRT]] that he would probably vote against the proposals, whilst [[Tomislav Karamarko]], leader of the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] said he would vote in favour.<ref name=BBC/>

==Opinion polls==
A poll conducted in June 2013 revealed that 55.3% of Croats support the changes, while 31.1% said they were opposed.<ref>[http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/553-posto-hrvata-za-brak-zene-i-muskarca-u-ustavu-565686 55,3 posto Hrvata za brak <U+017E>ene i mu<U+0161>karca u Ustavu] Vecernji, 6 June 2013</ref>
