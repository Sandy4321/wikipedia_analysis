'''Richard Edward O'Connor''' [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] (4 August 1851 <U+2013> 18 November 1912) was an Australian politician and judge.

A barrister and later Queen's Counsel, O'Connor was active in the campaign for Australian [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] and was a close associate of [[Edmund Barton]]. He served as New South Wales Minister for Justice from 1891 to 1893 while a member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] (1888&ndash;98), and was a member of the constitutional committee at the Federal Convention that drafted the [[Australian Constitution]]. A member of the [[Barton Ministry|first federal ministry]] as [[Vice-President of the Executive Council]], O'Connor led the government in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] from 1901 to 1903, playing a key role in the development of that chamber's role in Australian politics.

O'Connor resigned from Parliament in 1903 to become one of the inaugural justices of the [[High Court of Australia]], which he had helped to create. He had a reputation as a liberal and independent-minded justice who occasionally voted with the progressives on industrial matters after 1906. He was also the first president of the [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration]] from 1905 to 1907, and he continued to serve on the High Court until his early death in 1912.

==Early life==

Richard Edward O'Connor was born in the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]] on 4 August 1851. His mother was Mary Anne, ''n<U+00E9>e'' Harnett, while his father was [[Richard O'Connor (librarian)|Richard]], an Irish-born [[Catholic]] who at that time served as librarian to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]], and would later become Clerk of the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]], chairing its first meeting.<ref name=o'connor1>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography

From a young age his closest friend was [[Edmund Barton]], in whose Cabinet O'Connor would later serve.<ref name=adb/> He won the Wentworth medal for the best English essay in 1870, and received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1871 and a [[Master of Arts]] in 1873.<ref name=Senate>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Rutledge|first=Martha|editor-last=Millar|editor-first=Ann|title=O'Connor, Richard Edward (1851<U+2013>1912)|encyclopedia=The Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate|volume=1|pages=27<U+2013>30|publisher=Melbourne University Press|year=2000|isbn=0-522-84921-0}}</ref>

While studying for his Master's degree from 1871 to 1874, O'Connor worked as a clerk in the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]], after which he was articled with [[Frederick Darley]] (afterwards [[Chief Justice of New South Wales|Chief Justice]]), remaining solvent with contributions to the ''[[Freeman's Journal]]'', the ''[[The Echo (Irish newspaper)|Echo]]'' and the ''Evening News''.<ref name=Senate/> He was admitted to the bar on 15 June 1876.<ref name=adb/> An enthusiastic debater, he was a regular participant at the Sydney School of Arts Debating Club, encountering future political foes and personal friends [[William McMillan (Australian politician)|William McMillan]] and [[George Reid (Australian politician)|George Reid]].<ref name=adb/> Establishing his own law practice, he served as [[Crown Prosecutor (Australia)|Crown Prosecutor]] for the northern district. He married Sarah Jane Hensleigh on 30 October 1879 at St Joseph's Catholic Church in [[Delegate, New South Wales|Delegate]] on the border between New South Wales and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (Sarah came from [[Bendock, Victoria|Bendock]]).<ref name=Senate/>

==Colonial politics==

In the dispute between [[protectionism|protection]] and [[free trade]] that formed the backbone of Australian colonial politics in the late nineteenth century, O'Connor was a committed protectionist. Despite this, [[Henry Parkes|Sir Henry Parkes]], the [[Premier of New South Wales]] and a free trader, had him appointed to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] on 8 February 1888.<ref name=nsw>{{Cite web

O'Connor also served as Solicitor General from 19 July to 13 September 1893.<ref name=nsw/> In these portfolios he worked for electoral reform and supported the cause of the [[Federation of Australia|Federation]].<ref name=adb/> After becoming Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council in 1892 he exercised considerable control over that body, but his influence was greatly diminished after he and Barton were forced to resign from the ministry on 14 December 1893,<ref name=nsw/>  having accepted briefs in a case in which they were required to argue against the railway commissioners, a government department.<ref name=adb/> O'Connor remained in the Legislative Council but embarked on an overseas tour, travelling to [[Egypt]], [[Italy]], [[England]] and [[Ireland]].<ref name=adb/>

In 1895, O'Connor returned to New South Wales and successfully defended the protectionist demagogue [[Paddy Crick]] against conspiracy charges relating to the [[George Dean]] attempted murder case; he was appointed [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1896 and acted as a judge on the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Supreme Court]] from November 1898 to March 1899.<ref name=adb/> He also remained active politically. As a founding member of the Australian Federation League in 1893, he was appointed a vice-president of the People's Federal Convention held at [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] in November 1896.<ref name=Senate/> He was elected as a delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)#1897<U+2013>1898 convention|Australian Federal Convention]] in 1897 and served on the constitutional committee with Barton and the former [[South Australia]]n [[Premier of South Australia|Premier]] [[John Downer|Sir John Downer]]. He organised the "nexus clause" which guaranteed the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] half as many members as the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], arguing that this would act as an incentive to keep parliamentary numbers, and therefore expenditure, comparatively low.<ref name=Senate/>

[[Image:Richard O'Connor MLC.jpg|130px|thumb|right|upright|New South Wales parliamentary portrait]]
O'Connor resigned from the Legislative Council on 16 July 1898,<ref name=nsw/> in order to contest the lower house seat of [[Electoral district of Young|Young]] against the sitting [[Australian Labor Party|Labour]] member, [[Chris Watson]]. He focused his campaign on Federation issues but was surprised to be easily defeated by 1,244 votes to 876.<ref name=green>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Antony|authorlink=Antony Green|title=Young &ndash; 1898|work=New South Wales Elections, 1856&ndash;2007|publisher=[[New South Wales Parliament]]|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1898/Young.htm|accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref> Financial difficulties necessitated his focus on legal work rather than campaigning during the second Constitution referendum in 1899, although he still managed to speak most nights.<ref name=adb/> Following the success of the Federation, O'Connor was to be a member of the first Commonwealth ministry, and was instrumental in the affair that became known as the [[Hopetoun Blunder]]. [[John Hope, 1st Marquess of Linlithgow|Lord Hopetoun]], Australia's first [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], had commissioned [[William Lyne|Sir William Lyne]] to form a government, since Lyne was Premier of the largest state, New South Wales. O'Connor was one of those who refused to serve under Lyne, who had been lukewarm on the issue during the Federation campaigns, and was significant in the negotiations that led to Lyne's resignation of the commission in Barton's favour. On 1 January 1901, O'Connor was appointed [[Vice-President of the Executive Council]], an honorary post, in [[Barton Ministry|Barton's Cabinet]].<ref name=adb/>

==Federal politics==

O'Connor stood for the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1901|1901 federal election]] in March and was elected in the fourth position, with 40% of the vote (electors cast six votes, with the six candidates with the highest totals winning election).<ref name=psephos>{{cite web|last=Carr|first=Adam|title=1901 Senate: New South Wales|work=[[Psephos]]|url=http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/1901/1901senatensw.txt|accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref> The only [[Protectionist Party|Protectionist]] Senator from New South Wales, he was appointed Leader of the Government in the Senate, and was instrumental in the evolution of that house as subordinate to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]],<ref name=adb/> although he encouraged the introduction of legislation into the Senate.<ref name=Senate/> 

[[Image:Senator Richard O'Connor.jpg|130px|thumb|left|upright|Parliamentary portrait, c. 1901]]
O'Connor, who had only one ministerial colleague in the upper house, tabled standing orders for the Senate on 10 May 1901 in conjunction with those tabled in the House of Representatives, but the chamber instead adopted a committee to formulate standing orders of its own.<ref name=adb/> He was a vigorous supporter of the [[White Australia policy]], although he also supported voting rights for [[Australian Aborigines|Aborigines]] and other "coloured persons who are naturalised subjects", and supported [[Dalgety, New South Wales|Dalgety]] as the site for the national capital.<ref name=Senate/> He was also an advocate of [[proportional representation]] for the Senate as representative of the "true majority",<ref name=adb/> and managed to guide the 1902 Customs Tariff Act through the Senate with minimal interference.<ref name=adb/> He worked during this period under great financial difficulty as his position as Vice-President of the Executive Council carried with it no salary beyond that of a Senator, and parliamentary sessions in [[Melbourne]] greatly interfered with the running of his Sydney law practice. He had been offered a knighthood by Barton in 1902 but refused, lest he appear as "Sir Richard" before the bankruptcy courts. The number of salaried ministers was capped by the Constitution, but O'Connor was forced to write to the [[Attorney General of Australia|Attorney General]], his friend [[Alfred Deakin]], that he could not continue to work without remuneration.<ref name=Senate/> As a result, Deakin arranged for O'Connor's ministerial colleagues to each contribute <U+00A3>200 a year to a fund for honorary ministers.<ref name=adb/>

On 29 July 1903, O'Connor introduced legislation for the establishment of a [[High Court of Australia]], describing it as vital in "maintaining the balance of the Constitution".<ref name=adb/> Attacked as extravagant, the Judiciary Act was nonetheless passed, and O'Connor resigned his portfolio on 24 September, resigning from the Senate on 27 September.<ref name=adb/> He and Barton, who had likewise resigned, were appointed the first Puisne Justices of the High Court, with [[Samuel Griffith|Sir Samuel Griffith]] as Chief Justice.<ref name=adb/>

==High Court justice==

[[Image:opening hca melb.jpg|150px|thumb|right|upright|The opening of the High Court in the chambers of the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]], 6 October 1903]]
O'Connor was a liberal justice who saw judges as "not only the interpreters, but also the guardians of the Constitution", advocating the Court's primacy over the [[Privy Council]] on these matters.<ref name=Senate/> He worked well with Griffith and Barton, although he was the most frequent dissenter in their decisions.<ref name=adb/> The Court demanded a high standard of advocacy and acquired a reputation for overturning decisions made by the state supreme courts, and the justices' travelling expenses were cut by [[Josiah Symon|Sir Josiah Symon]], Attorney General in the short-lived [[George Reid (Australian politician)|Reid government]], in December 1904.<ref name=adb/> O'Connor argued that abolishing [[tipstave]]s was a more efficient way of dealing with the Court's increasing expenses and no decision was reached until [[Isaac Isaacs]], taking office with the expansion of the Court in July 1906, was able to broker a compromise.<ref name=adb/>

O'Connor was appointed the first president of the [[Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration]] in February 1905, a position he accepted with reluctance. He found it difficult to keep up with both positions, despite taking "a good deal of trouble with [arbitration] decisions", and resigned from the Arbitration Court in 1907.<ref name=Senate/> With the appointment of [[H. B. Higgins]] to the High Court with Isaacs in 1906, that body had become far less unanimous, with O'Connor sometimes agreeing with the two new justices on industrial matters.<ref name=adb/> Assailed by ailing health but forced to continue working since he still lacked a pension, he travelled overseas in 1907&ndash;08 and 1912.<ref name=adb/>

==Death and legacy==

O'Connor, still a sitting justice, died from [[pernicious anaemia]] at [[St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney|St Vincent's Hospital]] in the suburb of [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]] on 18 November 1912, aged 61; he had suffered from chronic [[nephritis]] for some years.<ref name=adb/> He was buried in the Anglican section of [[Rookwood Cemetery]], though with Catholic rites. He was survived by his wife Sarah, who died in 1925, and by six of his seven children. Of his two daughters, Winifred married Alexander Maclay (son of the Russian anthropologist and explorer [[Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay]]), and Kathleen married the pianist [[Roy Agnew]]. His eldest and youngest sons, Richard and Roderic, were killed at [[Armenti<U+00E8>res]] in 1916; the others, Arthur and Desmond, survived.<ref name=Senate/> After his death he received tributes from, among others, Barton, who believed "that assiduous toil did much to shorten a life that was most precious", and Griffith, who described O'Connor as "absolutely fearless in the performance of his judicial duties".<ref name=adb/> [[Billy Hughes]], then serving as Attorney General in the [[Andrew Fisher|Fisher]] Labor government, recalled that O'Connor "never exhibited any trace of personal enmity".<ref name=Senate/> The suburb of [[O'Connor, Australian Capital Territory|O'Connor]] in [[Canberra]] is named in his honour.<ref name=ACT>{{cite web|title=O'Connor Neighbourhood Plan: A sustainable future for O'Connor|url=http://www.actpla.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/2520/oconnor-anp.pdf|author=Australian Capital Territory Planning and Land Management Authority|date=July 2003|page=13|accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref>
