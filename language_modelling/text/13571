'''Luck in science''' tries to describe some of the ways that unexpected discoveries are made in science. [[Louis Pasteur]]'s famous quote "Luck favours the prepared mind" suggests that luck can be harnessed, and today researchers try to understand what it means to have a "prepared mind".<ref name=DunbarFugelsangLuck>Dunbar, K., & Fugelsang, J.

Research suggests that scientists are taught various [[heuristics]] that allow their investigations to benefit from serendipity.<ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/><ref name="Oliver, J.E. 1991">Oliver, J.E.

==The prepared mind==
Kevin Dunbar and Jonathan Fugelsang say that somewhere between 33% and 50% of all scientific discoveries are unexpected. This helps explain why scientists often call their discoveries "lucky", and yet scientist themselves may not be able to detail exactly what role luck played (see also[[introspection illusion]]).<ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/>  

Professor of economics [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] calls science "Anti-fragile". That is, while some methods of investigation are fragile in the face of human error and randomness, the scientific method is more than resistant: it actually benefits from such randomness in many ways (it is anti-fragile). Taleb believes that the more anti-fragile the system, the more it will flourish in the real world.<ref name=Talib>Talib contributes a brief description of anti-fragility, http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_3.html</ref>

[[File:DunbarFugelsangLuckInScience.png|thumb|right|200px|A model based on the work of Kevin Dunbar and Jonathan Fugelsang who describe how scientific methods help identify when a finding is unexpected. This potentially leads to new knowledge.]]
Dunbar and Fugelsang suggest that the process of discovery often starts when a researcher finds bugs in their experiment. These unexpected results lead a researcher to try and fix what they ''think'' is an error in their methodology using local hypotheses (e.g. analogies typical of the discipline to explain the current error). This process is also local in the sense that the scientist is relatively independent or else working with one partner. Eventually, the researcher decides that the error is too persistent and systematic to be a coincidence. At that point the methods become more broad than local: The researcher will begin to think of theoretical explanations for the error, sometimes seeking the help of colleagues across different domains of expertise. The highly controlled, cautious, curious and even social aspects of the scientific method are thus what make it well suited for identifying persistent systematic errors (anomalies).<ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/><ref name="Oliver, J.E. 1991"/>

===The brain===
Fugelsang and Dunbar observe scientists while they work together in labs or analyze data, but they also use experimental settings, and even [[neuroimaging]].<ref name=DunbarFugelsangLuck/> [[fMRI]] investigation found that unexpected findings were associated with particular brain activity. Unexpected findings were found to activate the[[prefrontal cortex]] as well as the [[left hemisphere]] in general. This suggests that unexpected findings provoke more attention, and the brain applies more linguistic, conscious systems to help explain those findings. This supports the idea that scientists are using particular abilities that exist to some extent in all humans.<ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/><ref>Gazzaniga, M. (2000). Cerebral specialization and interhemispheric communication: does the corpus callosum enable the human condition? Brain, 123, 1293-326.</ref> 

On the other hand, Dunbar and Fugelsang say that an ingenious experimental design (and control conditions) may not be enough for the researcher to properly appreciate when a finding is "unexpected". This is because a scientist must know all about what is expected before they can be surprised, and this takes experience in the field.<ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/>

==Discoveries helped by luck==
Royston Roberts says that various discoveries required a degree of genius, but also some lucky element for that genius to act on.<ref name=Roberts>Roberts, Royston M. (1989). Serendipity: Accidental Discoveries in Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. New York.</ref>

[[File:Ilja Jefimowitsch Repin 002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Newton's reflections that led him to his theories about gravity started when he saw an apple fall from a tree]]
The story of Newton and a falling apple contains some small serendipity. [[Sir Isaac Newton]] was once sitting in his yard, thinking and enjoying a cup of tea, when he noticed an apple fall from a tree. The apple fell straight down, perpendicular to the ground, and Newton found himself wondering why the apple never falls upward or off to a side. Newton soon realized that it was a property of all matter to have an attractive force, including the apple, and even the moon - which moves as one would expect if it was passing the earth but nevertheless being attracted. It was another 20 years before Newton published his detailed [[theory of gravity]], but he later visited the tree that helped him provoke the idea.<ref name=Roberts/> 

According to Roberts, the common story that [[Alfred Nobel]]'s discovered [[dynamite]] by accident may not be true. On the other hand, Nobel did make a discovery with the help of luck soon after that. It started when Nobel cut his finger on a piece of glass one day at work and subsequently applied [[collodion]] in order to form a protective layer over the wound (similar in principle to [[liquid bandage]]). Nobel was kept up at night by the pain in his finger, so he started to think about a problem he was having back at work: Nobel was trying to create a powerful explosive using nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine, but the two would not combine. Nobel realized that collodion (which he was using to dress his wound) could allow the two substances to combine, and [[blasting gelatin]] (as powerful as dynamite but much safer to handle) was born.<ref name=Roberts/>

[[File:2008-07-06 Bottle of Goo Gone solvent.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pasteur was lucky to be using a particular kind of acid salt, but also lucky that he left his solution on a window sill overnight. Otherwise there would have been no chemical reaction, and his genius would have had nothing to notice and interpret.<ref name=Roberts/>]]The French scientist [[Louis Pasteur]] is responsible for various discoveries, some of which involved serendipity in some way. This seems to be the case with Pasteur's discovery that chemically identical molecules can have [[chirality]] (the way a right handed baseball glove will not work with the left hand). Roberts writes "Pasteur was puzzled: the salts of tartaric acid and racemic acid were said to be identical in chemical composition and crystalline shape, but they had different effects on polarized light."<ref name=Roberts/> Pasteur later prepared a solution of only racemic acid and found that it itself contained salt crystals with chirality and which effected light differently. This was somewhat lucky because the type of salt crystals that Pasteur was studying (sodium ammonium salt of racemic acid) is one of few salts that would be visibly different in Pasteur's time. Moreover, the salts only differentiate if the solution reaches a temperature below 26 degrees; Pasteur did not know about this temperature requirement, but he did happen to store the solution on a window sill over night and the cold Paris air activated it.<ref name=Roberts/>

Other major discoveries that were helped by luck in some way include products like[[teflon]], [[nylon]], and [[penicillin]]. Ideas include the theory of the [[big bang]], and the discovery of [[DNA]]. The [[Rosetta stone]], the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] and the ruins of [[Pompeii]] also emerged partly out of serendipity.<ref name=Roberts/>
