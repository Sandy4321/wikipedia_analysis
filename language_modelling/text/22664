'''Corporal Seamus Doyle''' is a fictional soldier from [[Gearbox Software]]'s [[Brothers in Arms]] video game series.  He is a secondary character that is important to the main story of [[Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood]].

==Doyle's Background==
Seamus Doyle was born in [[Ireland]] and immigrated to the [[United States]].  He was raised by his mother (he never knew his father, which is interesting because he was named after him) and lived also with his sister.  Doyle arrived in Boston where it can be assumed is where he grew up until [[World War II]] began and he volunteered to become a paratrooper.  Doyle is a very tough and dedicated soldier and is extremely friendly and is known to be a talking machine.  

==Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood==
Doyle is a member of the famed [[82nd Airborne Division]] and took part in the reclamation of Normandy from the German defenders.  However during the drop Doyle was one of thousands of misdrops during the early morning of June 6, 1944.  Doyle landed apparently with little trouble and ended up saving the life of Corporal Joe "Red" Hartsock (see: [[Sergeant Joe "Red" Hartsock]]) from the [[101st Airborne Division]] and spent most of the early stages of [[D-Day]] with Hartsock and his unit until he was able to link up with the rest of the 82nd.  During that time Doyle and Hartsock became best friends.

Afterwards, Doyle didn't meet up with Hartsock until the 101st and 82nd took the city of Baupte and by that time both Doyle and Hartsock had been promoted to the rank of [[Sergeant]].  From then on out Hartsock and his squad helped Doyle and the 82nd push all the way to their objective at St. Sauveur, which was a strategically vital city that would pave the way for the [[4th Infantry Division]] to take [[Cherbourg]].  During the assault on the city Doyle was leading Private Paige from Hartsock's squad and both were unfortunately killed by a single tank shell burst.  The blast vaporized Doyle and [[Private Will Paige]] caught a piece of [[shrapnel]] and soon died from the sucking chest wound after pulling a disoriented Hartsock to safety.  About the only thing that remained of Doyle was his 82nd Airborne patch which Hartsock found and fastened to his helmet.

==Misc. Info==
It isn't known whether or not Doyle took part in the 82nd Airborne's rocky first combat jump in [[Sicily]] or their second action in [[Salerno]] but it can be assumed that he did considering his rank as an [[NCO]] (non-commissioned officer).  Doyle was issued the [[M1 Garand]] rifle which he used to good effect during D-Day and the following days after.  Doyle also seemed to have a very strong friendship with Pvt. Paige and several other members from Hartsock's squad.
