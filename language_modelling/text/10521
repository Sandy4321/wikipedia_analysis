{{Main|History of Miami}}
{{See also|National Register of Historic Places listings in Miami, Florida|Timeline of Miami, Florida history}}

The Miami area was inhabited for thousands of years by indigenous cultures. The [[Tequesta]]s occupied the area for a thousand years before European encounter.

In 1566 the explorer, [[Pedro Men<U+00E9>ndez de Avil<U+00E9>s]], claimed it for [[Spanish Empire|Spain]]. A Spanish [[mission (station)|mission]] was constructed one year later in 1567. Spain and Great Britain alternatively "controlled" Florida, and Spain ceded it to the United States in 1821. In 1836, the US built [[Fort Dallas]] as part of its development of the Florida Territory and attempt to suppress and remove the [[Seminole]]. The Miami area subsequently became a site of fighting during the [[Seminole Wars#Second Seminole War|Second Seminole War]].

Miami is noted as "the only major city in the United States conceived by a woman, [[Julia Tuttle]]",<ref>Henry, Brian. (1995) "Miami Centennial Trivia," ''South Florida History,'' Vol. 23 No. 3 Summer, 1995. p. 33</ref> a local citrus grower and a wealthy [[Cleveland]] native. The Miami area was better known as "Biscayne Bay Country" in the early years of its growth. In the late 19th century, reports described the area as a promising wilderness.<ref>"The Day in St. Augustine&nbsp;<U+2014> The Hack Line to Biscayne Bay", ''[[The Florida Times-Union]]'', 1893-1-10. Retrieved on 2007-8-25.</ref> The area was also characterized as "one of the finest building sites in Florida."<ref>"A Trip to Biscayne Bay", ''The Tropical Sun,'' 1893-3-09. Retrieved on 2006-1-22.</ref> The [[Great Freeze]] of 1894<U+2013>95 hastened Miami's growth, as the crops of the Miami area were the only ones in Florida that survived. Julia Tuttle subsequently convinced [[Henry Flagler]], a railroad tycoon, to expand his [[Florida East Coast Railway]] to the region, for which she became known as "the mother of Miami."<ref>Muir, Helen. (1953) ''Miami, USA'' Henry Holt and Company. p. 55<br>{{citation|last = Weiner|first = Jacqueline|title = Statue of Miami's First Lady, Julia Tuttle, may be birthday present|journal=Miami Today|date = Week of April 1, 2010|url = http://www.miamitodaynews.com/news/100401/story2.shtml}}</ref> Miami was officially incorporated as a city on July 28, 1896 with a population of just over 300.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmsf.org/history/south-florida-brief-history.htm|title=South Florida: A Brief History|author=Williams, Linda K. & George, Paul S.|publisher=Historical Museum of South Florida|accessdate=August 24, 2009}}</ref> It was named for the nearby [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]], which was named for the historic [[Mayaimi]] Indians who lived around [[Lake Okeechobee]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

During the early 20th century, northerners were attracted to the city, and Miami prospered during the 1920s with an increase in population and infrastructure. The collapse of the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s]], the [[1926 Miami Hurricane]], and the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s slowed development. When [[World War II]] began, Miami, well-situated on the southern coast of Florida, became a base for US defense against [[U-boat|German submarines]]. The war brought an increase in Miami's population; by 1940, 172,172 people lived in the city.

After [[Fidel Castro]] rose to power in Cuba in 1959, many wealthy [[Cuba]]ns sought refuge in Miami, further increasing the population. The city developed businesses and cultural amenities as part of the [[New South]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, South Florida weathered social problems related to drug wars, immigration from Haiti and Latin America, and the widespread destruction of [[Hurricane Andrew]]. Racial and cultural tensions were sometimes sparked, but the city developed in the latter half of the 20th century as a major international, financial, and cultural center. It is the second-largest U.S. city (after [[El Paso, Texas]]) with a Spanish-speaking majority, and the largest city with a [[Cuban-American]] plurality.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

Miami and its metropolitan area grew from just over one thousand residents to nearly five and a half million residents in just 110 years (1896<U+2013>2006). The city's nickname, ''The Magic City'', comes from this rapid growth. Winter visitors remarked that the city grew so much from one year to the next that it was like magic.<ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Mouth of Miami River 20100211.jpg|thumb|right|The mouth of the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]] at [[Brickell Key]].]]

Miami and its suburbs are located on a broad plain between the [[Florida Everglades]] to the west and [[Biscayne Bay]] to the east, which also extends from [[Florida Bay]] north to [[Lake Okeechobee]]. The elevation of the area never rises above {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Miami-Environment.html|title=Miami Environment|publisher=Advameg|accessdate=July 19, 2007}}</ref> and averages at around {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/luceneweb/caption_direct.jsp?photoId=STS062-85-026|title= Miami, Florida metropolitan area as seen from STS-62|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|accessdate=August 19, 2007}}</ref> above mean sea level in most neighborhoods, especially near the coast. The highest undulations are found along the coastal [[Miami Rock Ridge]], whose substrate underlies most of the eastern Miami metropolitan region. The main portion of the city lies on the shores of Biscayne Bay which contains several hundred natural and artificially created [[barrier island]]s, the largest of which contains [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] and [[South Beach]]. The [[Gulf Stream]], a warm [[ocean current]], runs northward just {{convert|15|mi|km}} off the coast, allowing the city's climate to stay warm and mild all year.

===Geology===
[[File:Miamihighpoint.jpg|thumb|left|View from one of the higher points in Miami, west of downtown. The highest natural point in Miami is in [[Coconut Grove]], near the bay, along the [[Miami Rock Ridge]] at {{convert|24|ft|m}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~whitmand/Courses/Fl_geo_notes.html|title=Notes on the geology and Water Resources of South Florida|author=Dean Whitman|date=September 1997|work=Notes on Florida Geology|publisher=[[Florida International University]]|accessdate=January 11, 2011}}</ref>]]

The surface bedrock under the Miami area is called ''Miami [[oolite]]'' or ''Miami [[limestone]]''. This bedrock is covered by a thin layer of soil, and is no more than {{convert|50|ft|m}} thick. Miami limestone formed as the result of the drastic changes in sea level associated with recent [[glaciation]]s or ''[[ice age]]s''. Beginning some 130,000 years ago the [[Eemian Stage|Sangamonian Stage]] raised sea levels to approximately {{convert|25|ft|m}} above the current level. All of southern Florida was covered by a shallow sea. Several parallel lines of reef formed along the edge of the submerged Florida [[plateau]], stretching from the present Miami area to what is now the [[Dry Tortugas]]. The area behind this reef line was in effect a large lagoon, and the Miami limestone formed throughout the area from the deposition of oolites and the shells of [[bryozoans]]. Starting about 100,000 years ago the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] began lowering sea levels, exposing the floor of the lagoon. By 15,000 years ago, the sea level had dropped to 300 to {{convert|350|ft|m}} below the contemporary level. The sea level rose quickly after that, stabilizing at the current level about 4000 years ago, leaving the [[mainland]] of South Florida just [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

Beneath the plain lies the [[Biscayne Aquifer]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://capp.water.usgs.gov/gwa/ch_g/G-text4.html|title=USGS Ground Water Atlas of the United States|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=February 19, 2006}}</ref> a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach County]] to [[Florida Bay]], with its highest point peaking around the cities of [[Miami Springs, Florida|Miami Springs]] and [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]]. Most of the [[Miami metropolitan area]] obtains its drinking water from this aquifer. As a result of the aquifer, it is not possible to dig more than {{convert|15|to|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} beneath the city without hitting water, which impedes underground construction. For this reason, the [[rapid transit|mass transit]] systems in and around Miami are elevated or [[land grading|at-grade]].

Most of the western fringes of the city extend into the [[Everglades]], a subtropical marshland located in the southern portion of the U.S. state of Florida. [[American Alligator|Alligators]] have ventured into Miami communities and on major highways.

In terms of land area, Miami is one of the smallest major cities in the United States. According to the [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]], the city encompasses a total area of {{convert|55.27|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}. Of that area, {{convert|35.67|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|19.59|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} is water. That means Miami comprises over 400,000 people in {{convert|35|sqmi|km2}}, making it one of the most densely populated cities in the United States, along with New York City, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia. Miami is located at {{Coord|25|47|16|N|80|13|27|W|}}.{{GR|1|dateform=mdy}}

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Miami}}
[[File:Miamisummershower.png|thumb|left|Typical summer afternoon thunderstorm rolling in from the [[Everglades]].]]

Miami has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]] ''Am'')<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pdf/kottek_et_al_2006_A4.pdf
|title=World Map of K<U+00F6>ppen<U+2212>Geiger Climate Classification}}</ref> with hot and humid summers and short, warm winters, with a marked drier season in the winter. Its sea-level elevation, coastal location, position just above the [[Tropic of Cancer]], and proximity to the [[Gulf Stream]] shapes its climate. With January averaging {{convert|67.2|F}}, winter features mild to warm temperatures; cool air usually settles after the passage of a cold front, which produces much of the little amount of rainfall. Lows sometimes fall below {{convert|50|F}}, but very rarely below {{convert|35|F}}. Highs generally range between {{convert|70|-|77|F|C}}. The wet season begins some time in May, ending in mid-October. During this period, temperatures are in the mid 80s to low 90s (29<U+2013>35 <U+00B0>C), accompanied by high humidity, though the heat is often relieved by afternoon [[thunderstorm]]s or a [[sea breeze]] that develops off the Atlantic Ocean, which then allow lower temperatures, but conditions still remain very muggy. Much of the year's {{convert|55.9|in|mm|0}} of rainfall occurs during this period.

Extremes range from {{convert|27|<U+00B0>F|1}} on February 3, 1917 to {{convert|100|<U+00B0>F|0}} on July 21, 1940.<ref>{{cite web

[[Tropical cyclone|Hurricane season]] officially runs from June 1 through November 30, although hurricanes can develop beyond those dates. The most likely time for Miami to be hit is during the peak of the [[Cape Verde-type hurricane|Cape Verde]] season, which is mid-August through the end of September.<ref>{{cite web

{{Main|Neighborhoods in Miami}}
[[File:Biscayne Boulevard night 20101202.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Downtown Miami|Downtown]] area has the fastest-growing neighborhoods in the city.]]

Miami is partitioned into many different sections, roughly into North, South, West and Downtown. The heart of the city is [[Downtown Miami]] and is technically on the eastern side of the city. This area includes [[Brickell]], [[Virginia Key]], [[Watson Island, Miami, Florida|Watson Island]], and the [[Port of Miami]]. Downtown is [[South Florida]]'s central business district, and Florida's largest and most influential central business district. Downtown has the largest concentration of international banks in the U.S. along [[Brickell Avenue]]. Downtown is home to many major banks, [[courthouse]]s, financial headquarters, cultural and tourist attractions, schools, parks and a large residential population. East of Downtown, across [[Biscayne Bay]] is [[South Beach]]. Just northwest of Downtown, is the [[Civic Center (Miami)|Civic Center]], which is Miami's center for hospitals, [[research institute]]s and [[biotechnology]] with hospitals such as [[Jackson Memorial Hospital]], Miami VA Hospital, and the [[University of Miami]]'s [[Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine]].

The southern side of Miami includes [[Coral Way]], [[The Roads]] and [[Coconut Grove, Miami, Florida|Coconut Grove]]. Coral Way is a historic residential neighborhood built in 1922 connecting Downtown with [[Coral Gables]], and is home to many old homes and tree-lined streets. Coconut Grove was established in 1825 and is the location of Miami's City Hall in [[Dinner Key]], the [[Coconut Grove Playhouse]], [[CocoWalk]], many [[nightclub]]s, bars, restaurants and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] shops, and as such, is very popular with local [[college student]]s. It is a historic neighborhood with narrow, winding roads, and a heavy tree canopy. Coconut Grove has many parks and gardens such as [[Villa Vizcaya]], [[The Kampong]], [[The Barnacle Historic State Park]], and is the home of the Coconut Grove Convention Center and numerous historic homes and estates.

The western side of Miami includes [[Little Havana]], West Flagler, and [[Flagami]], and is home to many of the city's traditionally immigrant neighborhoods. Although at one time a mostly Jewish neighborhood, today western Miami is home to immigrants from mostly Central America and [[Cuba]], while the west central neighborhood of [[Allapattah, Florida|Allapattah]] is a multicultural community of many ethnicities.

The northern side of Miami includes [[Midtown Miami|Midtown]], a district with a great mix of diversity with many [[West Indian American|West Indians]], [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]], [[European Americans]], [[Bohemianism|bohemians]], and artists. [[Edgewater, Miami, Florida|Edgewater]], and [[Wynwood Art District|Wynwood]], are neighborhoods of Midtown and are made up mostly of high-rise residential towers and are home to the [[Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts]]. The wealthier residents usually live in the northeastern part, in Midtown, the [[Miami Design District|Design District]], and the [[Upper Eastside, Miami, Florida|Upper East Side]], with many sought after 1920s homes and home of the [[Miami Modern Architecture|MiMo Historic District]], a style of architecture originated in Miami in the 1950s. The northern side of Miami, also has notable African American and Caribbean immigrant communities such as [[Little Haiti]], [[Overtown (Miami)|Overtown]] (home of the [[Lyric Theater (Miami)|Lyric Theater]]), and [[Liberty City]].

Floribbean cuisine is widely available throughout Miami and South Florida, and can be found in restaurant chains such as [[Pollo Tropical]].

Cuban immigrants in the 1960s brought the [[Cuban sandwich]], [[medianoche]], [[Cuban espresso]], and [[croqueta]]s, all of which have grown in popularity to all Miamians, and have become symbols of the city's varied cuisine. Today, these are part of the local culture, and can be found throughout the city in window caf<U+00E9>s, particularly outside of supermarkets and restaurants.<ref>[http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Sandwiches/CubanSandwich.htm Cuban Sandwich, History of Cuban Sandwich, History of Cubano Sandwich].

===Dialect===
{{See also|North American English regional phonology|Southern American English#Atlantic}}

The Miami area has a unique dialect, (commonly called the "Miami dialect") which is widely spoken. The dialect developed among second- or third-generation [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]], including [[Cuban-American]]s, whose first language was English (though some [[non-Hispanic white]], [[black people|black]], and [[Race in the US|other races]] who were born and raised the Miami area tend to adopt it as well.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wlrn.org/post/miami-accents-why-locals-embrace-heavy-l-or-not?nopop=1 |title=Miami Accents: Why Locals Embrace That Heavy "L" Or Not|publisher=WLRN ([[WLRN-TV]] and [[WLRN-FM]])|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}</ref> It is based on a fairly [[General American|standard American accent]] but with some changes very similar to dialects in the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] (especially the [[New York dialect|New York area dialect]], [[New Jersey English#North Jersey English|Northern New Jersey English]], and [[New York Latino English]].) Unlike Virginia Piedmont, Coastal Southern American, and Northeast American dialects and Florida Cracker dialect (see section below), "Miami accent" is [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]]; it also incorporates a rhythm and pronunciation heavily influenced by Spanish (wherein rhythm is [[isochrony#syllable timing|syllable-timed]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-06-13/news/0406130047_1_cuban-accent-spanish-sound |title='Miami Accent' Takes Speakers By Surprise|work=Articles <U+2013> [[Sun-Sentinel|Sun-Sentinel.com]] |date=June 13, 2004|accessdate=2012-10-08}}</ref>
However, this is a native dialect of English, not learner English or [[interlanguage]]; it is possible to differentiate this variety from an [[interlanguage]] spoken by second-language speakers in that "Miami accent" does ''not'' generally display the following features: there is no [[epenthesis|addition]] of {{IPA|/<U+025B>/}} before initial consonant clusters with {{IPA|/s/}}, speakers do not confuse of {{IPA|/d<U+0292>/}} with {{IPA|/j/}}, (e.g., ''Yale'' with ''jail''), and /r/ and /rr/ are pronounced as [[Alveolar approximant|alveolar approximant [{{IPA|<U+0279>}}<nowiki>]</nowiki>]] instead of [[alveolar tap]] [{{IPA|<U+027E>}}] or [[alveolar trill]] [r] in Spanish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wlrn.org/post/miami-accents-how-miamah-turned-different-sort-twang |title=Miami Accents: How 'Miamah' Turned Into A Different Sort Of Twang|publisher=WLRN ([[WLRN-TV]] & [[WLRN-FM]])|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}</ref><ref>http://wlrn.org/post/miami-accents-why-locals-embrace-heavy-l-or-not</ref><ref>http://wlrn.org/post/miami-accents-how-miamah-turned-different-sort-twang</ref><ref>http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/09/07/3609984/english-in-the-305-has-its-own.html</ref>

Today, immigration to Miami has slowed significantly and Miami's growth today is attributed greatly to its fast urbanization and high-rise construction, which has increased its inner city neighborhood population densities, such as in [[Downtown Miami|Downtown]], [[Brickell]], and [[Edgewater (Miami)|Edgewater]], where one area in Downtown alone saw a 2,069% increase in population in the 2010 Census. Miami is regarded as more of a [[multiculturalism|multicultural mosaic]], than it is a [[melting pot]], with residents still maintaining much of, or some of their [[Culture|cultural traits]]. The overall culture of Miami is heavily influenced by its large population of Hispanics, and Blacks, mainly from the [[Caribbean]] islands.

[[File:Miami-florida-royal-caribbean-building.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Royal Caribbean International]] headquarters at the [[Port of Miami]].]]
Miami is home to one of the largest ports in the United States, the [[Port of Miami]]. It is the largest cruise ship port in the world. The port is often called the "Cruise Capital of the World" and the "Cargo Gateway of the Americas".<ref name=miamiport>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/portofmiami/|title=Port of Miami|work=Miami-Dade County|accessdate=October 28, 2008}}</ref> It has retained its status as the number one cruise/passenger port in the world for well over a decade accommodating the largest cruise ships and the major cruise lines.

===Public transportation===
[[File:Metrorail-Tri-Rail.png|thumb|right|The [[Miami Metrorail]] is the city's [[rapid transit]] system and connects the city's central core with its outlying suburbs]]
[[File:Tri-Rail at Delray Beach Station.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tri-Rail]] is Miami's [[commuter rail]] that runs north-south from Miami's suburbs in [[West Palm Beach]] to [[Miami International Airport]].]]
{{Main|Miami-Dade Transit}}

Public transportation in Miami is operated by [[Miami-Dade Transit]] and [[South Florida Regional Transportation Authority|SFRTA]], and includes [[commuter rail]] ([[Tri-Rail]]), heavy-rail [[rapid transit]] ([[Metrorail (Miami)|Metrorail]]), an elevated [[people mover]] ([[Metromover]]), and buses ([[Miami-Dade Transit#Metrobus|Metrobus]]). Miami has Florida's highest transit ridership as about 17% of Miamians use transit on a daily basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/acs/www/|title=American Community Survey|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}</ref>

Miami's heavy-rail rapid transit system, [[Metrorail (Miami)|Metrorail]], is an elevated system comprising two lines and 23 stations on a {{convert|24.4|mi|km|adj=on}}-long line. Metrorail connects the urban western suburbs of [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]], [[Medley, Florida|Medley]], and inner-city Miami with suburban [[The Roads]], [[Coconut Grove]], [[Coral Gables]], [[South Miami]] and urban [[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]] via the central business districts of [[Miami International Airport]], the [[Civic Center (Miami)|Civic Center]], and [[Downtown Miami|Downtown]]. A free, elevated [[people mover]], [[Metromover]], operates 21 stations on three different lines in greater [[Downtown Miami]], with a station at roughly every two blocks of Downtown and [[Brickell]]. Several expansion projects are being funded by a transit development sales tax surcharge throughout Miami-Dade County.

[[Tri-Rail]], a commuter rail system operated by the [[South Florida Regional Transportation Authority]] (SFRTA), runs from [[Miami International Airport]] northward to [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]], making eighteen stops throughout [[Miami-Dade County|Miami-Dade]], [[Broward County|Broward]], and [[Palm Beach County|Palm Beach]] counties.

Construction is currently underway on the [[Miami Intermodal Center]] and [[Miami Central Station]], a massive transportation hub servicing [[Metrorail (Miami)|Metrorail]], [[Amtrak]], [[Tri-Rail]], [[Miami-Dade Transit#Metrobus|Metrobus]], [[Greyhound Lines]], [[Taxicab|taxis]], [[rental cars]], [[MIA Mover]], private automobiles, bicycles and pedestrians adjacent to Miami International Airport. Completion of the Miami Intermodal Center is expected to be completed by winter 2011, and will serve over 150,000 commuters and travelers in the Miami area. Phase I of Miami Central Station is scheduled to begin service in the spring of 2012, and Phase II in 2013.

Two new light rail systems, Baylink and the Miami Streetcar, have been proposed and are currently in the planning stage. BayLink would connect [[Downtown Miami|Downtown]] with [[South Beach]], and the Miami Streetcar would connect Downtown with [[Midtown Miami|Midtown]].

===Rail===
Miami is the southern terminus of [[Amtrak]]'s Atlantic Coast services, running two lines, the [[Silver Meteor]] and the [[Silver Star (Amtrak train)|Silver Star]], both terminating in New York City. The Miami Amtrak Station is located in the suburb of [[Hialeah]] near the [[Tri-Rail and Metrorail transfer station|Tri-Rail/Metrorail Station]] on NW 79 St and NW 38 Ave. Current construction of the [[Miami Central Station]] will move all Amtrak operations from its current out-of-the-way location to a centralized location with [[Miami Metrorail|Metrorail]], [[MIA Mover]], [[Tri-Rail]], [[Miami International Airport]], and the [[Miami Intermodal Center]] all within the same station closer to Downtown. The station is expected to be completed by 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.micdot.com/miami_central_station.html|title=Miami Intermodal Center|publisher=Micdot.com|accessdate=October 30, 2010}}</ref>

[[Florida High Speed Rail]] was planned to connect Miami with [[Orlando]] and [[Tampa]] in a single line, but was canceled in 2011.

===Road===
[[File:Venetian Causeway South Beach.jpg|upright=2|thumb|The [[Venetian Causeway]] (left) and [[MacArthur Causeway]] (right) connect [[Downtown Miami|Downtown]] and [[South Beach]], [[Miami Beach]].]]
Miami's road system is based along the numerical "Miami Grid" where [[Flagler Street]] forms the east-west [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]] and [[Miami Avenue]] forms the north-south [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]]. The corner of Flagler Street and Miami Avenue is in the middle of [[Downtown Miami|Downtown]] in front of the Downtown [[Macy's]] (formerly the [[Burdine's]] headquarters). The Miami grid is primarily numerical so that, for example, all street addresses north of Flagler Street and west of Miami Avenue have "NW" in their address. Because its point of origin is in [[Downtown Miami|Downtown]], which is close to the coast, therefore, the "NW" and "SW" quadrants are much larger than the "SE" and "NE" quadrants. Many roads, especially major ones, are also named (e.g., [[Tamiami Trail|Tamiami Trail/SW 8th St]]), although, with exceptions, the number is in more common usage among locals.

All streets and avenues in [[Miami-Dade County]] follow the Miami Grid, with a few exceptions, most notably [[Coral Gables]], [[Hialeah]], [[Coconut Grove]] and [[Miami Beach]]. One neighborhood, [[The Roads]], is thusly named because its streets run off the Miami Grid in a 45-degree angle, and therefore are all named roads.

[[Miami-Dade County]] is served by four Interstate Highways ([[Interstate 75 (Florida)|I-75]], [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]], [[Interstate 195 (Florida)|I-195]], [[Interstate 395 (Florida)|I-395]]) and several U.S. Highways including [[U.S. Route 1 (Florida)|U.S. Route 1]], [[U.S. Route 27 (Florida)|U.S. Route 27]], [[U.S. Route 41 (Florida)|U.S. Route 41]], and [[U.S. Route 441 (Florida)|U.S. Route 441]].

Some of the major [[Florida State Roads]] (and their common names) serving Miami are:
*[[State Road 112 (Florida)|SR 112]] (Airport Expressway): [[Interstate 95]] to [[Miami International Airport|MIA]]
*[[State Road 821 (Florida)|SR 821]] (The [[HEFT]] or Homestead Extension of the [[Florida Turnpike]]): [[State Road 91 (Florida)|SR 91]]/[[Miami Gardens, Florida|Miami Gardens]] to [[U.S. Route 1 (Florida)|U.S. Route 1]]/[[Florida City, Florida|Florida City]]
*[[State Road 826 (Florida)|SR 826]] (Palmetto Expressway): [[Golden Glades Interchange]] to U.S. Route 1/[[Pinecrest, Florida|Pinecrest]]
*[[State Road 836 (Florida)|SR 836]] (Dolphin Expressway): Downtown to SW 137th Ave via [[Miami International Airport|MIA]]
*[[State Road 874 (Florida)|SR 874]] (Don Shula Expressway): 826/Bird Road to Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike/[[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]]
*[[State Road 878 (Florida)|SR 878]] (Snapper Creek Expressway): SR 874/[[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]] to U.S. Route 1/Pinecrest & [[South Miami, Florida|South Miami]]
*[[State Road 924 (Florida)|SR 924]] (Gratigny Parkway) [[Miami Lakes, Florida|Miami Lakes]] to [[Opa-locka, Florida|Opa-locka]]

===Bicycling===
In recent years the city government, under Mayor [[Manny Diaz (Florida politician)|Manny Diaz]], has taken an ambitious stance in support of [[bicycling]] in Miami for both recreation and commuting. Every month, the city hosts "Bike Miami", where major streets in Downtown and Brickell are closed to automobiles, but left open for pedestrians and [[bicyclist]]s. The event began in November 2008, and has doubled in popularity from 1,500 participants to about 3,000 in the October 2009 Bike Miami. This is the longest running such event in the US. In October 2009, the city also approved an extensive 20-year plan for bike routes and paths around the city. The city has begun construction of bike routes as of late 2009, and ordinances requiring bike parking in all future construction in the city became mandatory as of October 2009.<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/1460/story/1263994.html ]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref>
