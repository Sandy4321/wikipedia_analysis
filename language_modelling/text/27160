'''James Clark Morrison''' (born [[May 25]], [[1986]] in [[Darlington]], [[England]]) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[football (soccer)|footballer]], currently playing for [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]. His ability to run with the ball at pace makes him an effective option through the middle, as an attacking midfielder, or more often as a right winger.

==Career==
A former pupil of [[Hummersknott School]] in [[Darlington]], Morrison is a product of [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]'s youth academy. He starred in Middlesbrough's [[FA Youth Cup]] winning side in [[2003-04 in English football|2003&ndash;04]], putting in several eye-catching performances throughout the cup run, notably scoring in the final first leg 3&ndash;0 win against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. 

His initial outings in the first team displayed some promise too. He made his first-team debut on [[3 January]] [[2004]], coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2&ndash;0 [[FA Cup]] victory against [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]].<ref>{{cite news
