'''Linvoy Stephen Primus''' (born 14 September 1973) is an [[England|English]] [[Christian]] charity worker and former [[Association football|footballer]]. He played mainly for [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], and was primarily a [[defender (football)|central defender]], although he could play at [[right back]].

Born in [[Forest Gate]], England, to [[Caribbean]]-born parents, Primus began his professional career at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]; where he made four league appearances. Primus moved on a [[Free transfer (football)|free transfer]] to [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] and established himself as a [[first team]] regular in the lower divisions of English football before earning a <U+00A3>250,000 transfer to [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]. 

A [[Bosman ruling|Bosman transfer]] to Portsmouth followed after three successful seasons at the [[Berkshire]]-based club. Initially, Primus struggled to break into the team and had his progress hindered by injuries but the [[2002<U+2013>03 in English football|2002&ndash;03 season]] signalled a change in direction as Primus broke into the first team and won Portsmouth fan's player of the season as well as the [[PFA Fans' Player of the Year]] for his division. For the next three seasons Primus was in and out of the first team and worked under three different managers: [[Harry Redknapp]], [[Velimir Zajec]] and [[Alain Perrin]]. The [[2006<U+2013>07 FA Premier League|2006&ndash;07 season]] was the last injury-free season for Primus as a career threatening knee injury meant he would not make a single appearance the [[2007<U+2013>08 Premier League|following season]]. Primus went out on loan to former club Charlton and made 10 appearances and one further appearance for Portsmouth before retiring through injury in December 2009.

Primus, who is married and has two children, is also known for his Christian charity work. He is involved in the Christian charity 'Faith & Football' and walked the [[Great Wall of China]] to raise <U+00A3>100,000 for their cause. Other charitable causes he has been involved in are the [[Alpha course]], a cinema advertisement about Christianity and the formation of a [[Prayer_group#Prayer_groups|prayer group]] at Portsmouth. In 2007, he released his [[autobiography]], titled "Transformed", which details his [[conversion to Christianity]].

==Early life==
Primus was born the first child of Newton and Pauline Primus in Forest Gate Hospital, [[Forest Gate]], [[Greater London]] on 14 September 1973.<ref>{{cite book

Primus' father, who was born in [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|St. Vincent and the Grenadines]], worked for Thames Water as an engineer.<ref>{{cite book
| last= Primus| page = 15}}</ref> His parents are both practising Christians and took Linvoy to church and Sunday school when he was young. In his autobiography he wrote that church was "a cold unwelcoming place" for him as a child but also that it "instilled in [him] a very strong sense of right and wrong".<ref name="early church and Villa">{{cite book
| last= Primus| pages = 17&ndash;18}}</ref> Primus attributed his desire to become a footballer from watching [[Ricardo Villa|Ricky Villa]]'s winning goal for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in the [[1981 FA Cup Final#Replay|1981 FA Cup Final Replay]].<ref name="early church and Villa"/> He played his first game of football two years later in a match between two [[Cub Scout]] groups and, because of his performance, he was offered a trial with the Newham District Schools under-11's by one of the Cub Scout leaders who was also the manager. Primus played as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]] or [[Midfielder#Winger|right winger]] at this time, also in the team was future Portsmouth team mate [[Sol Campbell]] who played in [[Midfielder|midfield]].<ref>{{cite book
| last= Primus| page = 19}}</ref>

==Football career==
===Early career===
In Primus' early teenage years he played for his local [[Sunday league football]] club, Pretoria, based in [[Canning Town]] after being introduced by a school friend. [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] arranged a [[friendly match]] with Pretoria and Primus was offered the chance to join the Charlton associate schoolboys which he took. For the last two years of his school life, Primus travelled to [[London Borough of Greenwich|Greenwich]] twice a week to train with the team, in addition to this he played matches on a Sunday against the schoolboy teams of clubs such as [[Maidstone United F.C.|Maidstone United]] and [[Dover Athletic F.C.|Dover Athletic]].<ref>{{cite book
| last= Primus| pages = 19&ndash;22}}</ref><ref name="Southend Christians">{{cite web |url=http://www.southendchristianfellowship.org.uk/content.php?folder_id=77|title= My Story > Linvoy Primus|publisher=Southend Christian Fellowship|accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref> Primus initially struggled to cope; he cited the "dog eat dog" nature and the "ambitious and aggressive" parents as factors but nevertheless he decided to see it through later remarking that it was a "very strong character building experience".<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| pages = 23&ndash;24}}</ref>

===Charlton Athletic===

After finishing his [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSEs]], where he achieved three A grades,<ref>{{cite book
| last= Primus| page = 20}}</ref> Primus signed a two-year apprenticeship with Charlton. At this time he also received an offer from [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], who were in a higher division, but he rejected this because he felt his first team opportunities would be greater at Charlton.<ref name="Southend Christians"/> Primus was playing in various positions until the club's youth team coach, [[Colin Clarke (Scottish footballer)|Colin Clarke]], decided that he should play as a [[centre back]], "I see you as a centre back, that way you can see everything you want in front of you".<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| page = 24}}</ref>

[[Image:TheSirTrevorBrooking Stand.JPG|thumb|right|[[Boleyn Ground]], often known as Upton Park, the stadium where Primus made his Charlton debut|alt=A stand from a football stadium with laid out turf and two adjacent goals in the foreground. On the claret stands are the words written in sky blue capitals "Sir Trevor Brooking stand" on top of the larger words "West Ham United". There are men in orange jackets scattered around the stadium.]]

Under the [[Youth Training Scheme]], Primus was earning <U+00A3>35 a week while training with the [[Youth system|youth]] and [[Reserve team|reserve]] teams as well as having cleaning duties. He also had to study Leisure Management at a nearby college which he disliked. Primus, along with [[Jermaine Darlington]], was chosen to travel to Charlton's temporary stadium [[Selhurst Park]] to lay out the kits and the boots for the senior players and he admitted this may have earned him "[[Brownie points]]" with the youth management.<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| page = 25}}</ref> Primus began playing in the reserves under manager [[Alan Curbishley]] and at the end of his apprenticeship, Primus was offered a one-year professional contract by the new youth team coach [[John Cartwright (footballer)|John Cartwright]]. Darlington was the only other apprentice who was offered a contract.<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| pages = 27&ndash;28}}</ref>

Due to injuries to first team centre backs [[Simon Webster (footballer)|Simon Webster]] and [[Darren Pitcher]], Primus made his professional debut against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. The match took place at their substitute stadium [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]] in November 1992 and Primus was awarded [[man of the match]] for his performance. Primus played the next two matches against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] but was disappointed with his performance in both matches.<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| pages = 31&ndash;33| chapter = Shown the door}}</ref> Primus made two further first team appearances in the [[1992<U+2013>93 FA Premier League|1992&ndash;93 season]] but soon found himself lower down in the pecking order after other players returned from injury and Primus himself got injured.<ref name="Soccerbase">{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=6478|title= Soccerbase - Linvoy Primus|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=2010-01-08}}</ref> Primus felt that he had to leave the club: "I really felt as though I wasn't wanted and that my days were numbered."<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| page = 35}}</ref> Despite this, he signed a one-year extension with the Greenwich-based club. However, he suffered another muscle injury, and with further competition for places in the form of [[Dean Chandler]] and [[Richard Rufus]], he failed to make a single appearance for Charlton in the [[1993<U+2013>94 FA Premier League|1993&ndash;94 season]] and was released at the end of it.<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| pages = 38&ndash;39}}</ref>

===Barnet===

Primus first rejected a trial with [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] before accepting one with [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. Just three days before his trial with Cardiff was set to begin [[Ray Clemence]], the [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] manager, offered Primus a two-year contract with the club. It was later revealed that Clemence was told by his assistant, Terry Harvey, that he should sign him immediately: "Get in now and sign him, if he goes down to Cardiff and sees their stadium he will sign for them."<ref>{{cite book
| last= Primus| page = 40}}</ref> Primus was determined to prove Charlton wrong and says he "grew from a boy to a man" at Barnet. He also started [[Alcoholic beverage|drinking]] whenever he felt depressed about something and tried drugs such as [[MDMA|ecstasy]] and [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]].<ref name="Southend Christians"/><ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| page = 53}}</ref>

In the second game of the [[1994<U+2013>95 in English football|1994&ndash;95 season]] against [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], Primus made his debut as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] coming on for the injured [[Mark Newson]]. His next appearance for Barnet, against [[Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough]], was described as the "worst performance of [his] career" in his autobiography. He went on to say that he was "weighed down by the burden of expectation" and heard someone say he was the "worst player we've ever had at Barnet". He was often nervous before matches and recited the [[Lord's Prayer]] as a way of coping with his [[anxiety]].<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| pages = 43&ndash;45| chapter = From a boy to a man}}</ref> At the end of the season, Primus was runner-up in the voting for the Player of the Season and was man of the match on several occasions.<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| page = 49}}</ref> Barnet had a poor start to the [[1995<U+2013>96 in English football|next season]] and they were at the bottom of the table in mid-September. After beating [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] 2&ndash;0, Barnet went on an 11-game winning streak which ended at [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] despite Primus scoring a goal.<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| page = 51}}</ref> He would go on to score five goals in the season; more than any other season in his career.<ref name="Soccerbase"/> Once again, he was runner-up in the Player of the Season award; this time to the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Maik Taylor]].<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| page = 52}}</ref>

His [[1996<U+2013>97 in English football|third season]] for the club was an unsettled one. The club went through three different managers after the departure of Clemence: [[Terry Bullivant]] (twice), [[Terry Gibson]] and [[Alan Mullery]]. Nevertheless, Barnet narrowly avoided [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] to the [[Football Conference|Conference]] and Primus was awarded the Player of the Season and given the [[Captain (association football)|captaincy]] after a season which saw him make 46 league appearances. After Bullivant left for [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], however, Primus became unsettled and said "[I was] hankering after a move to join Terry [Bullivant] and Pards [Alan Pardew] at Reading".<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| pages = 54&ndash;56}}</ref>

===Reading===

Primus was signed for <U+00A3>500,000 at the start of the [[1997<U+2013>98 in English football|1997&ndash;98 season]] although he found himself being sued by the Stellar Sports Agency after the <U+00A3>8,000 fee was not paid because of difficulties with Primus' agent.<ref>{{cite web 
|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-uniteds-brazilian-deal-runs-aground-1253191.html|title=Football: United's Brazilian deal runs aground|publisher=''The Independent''|date=1997-07-29 |accessdate=2010-02-16|last=Nixon|first=Alan}}</ref> Also joining him in Berkshire was Barnet team mate [[Lee Hodges (footballer born 1973)|Lee Hodges]].<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| pages = 57&ndash;59| chapter = Tears of frustration}}</ref> Primus partnered [[Keith McPherson]] in defence but Reading started the season poorly with just one point from the first six games despite Primus saying "I played well from the word go".<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| page = 60}}</ref> Due to an injury crisis, Reading lost their penultimate league match with [[Nottingham Forest F.C|Nottingham Forest]] and were relegated from [[Football League First Division|Division One]]. This was Primus' first experience of relegation.<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| pages = 66&ndash;69}}</ref>

In the [[1998-99 in English football|next season]], Reading finished 10th and faced strong competition from new signing [[Elroy Kromheer]], but Primus became disillusioned at the financial situation he was in. He was on <U+00A3>1,500 a week and commented "[new signings were] on twice the wages I was being paid and I had seen the lifestyles they were enjoying".<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| pages = 72&ndash;73| chapter = It shouldn't be like this...}}</ref> Primus was promised an improved contract, however no such contract was given to him over the summer. By popular demand, manager [[Tommy Burns (footballer)|Tommy Burns]] was replaced by [[Alan Pardew]]. Fitness problems prevented Primus from getting much first team football at the start of the [[1999<U+2013>2000 Football League|1999<U+2013>2000 season]] until a change of diet helped him regain stamina. As the season progressed, the club offered Primus a new contract which he dismissed as "derisory" saying the club was "taking advantage of [his] good nature".<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| pages = 74&ndash;78}}</ref>

At the end of the season, Primus was free to leave under the [[Bosman ruling]] and received an offer from [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] which he accepted. [[Lennie Lawrence]], the manager who bidded for Primus was sacked soon afterwards, however, and the deal was cancelled to the dismay of Primus who said he felt as if "[his] whole world had collapsed". In the aftermath, Pardew put him in contact with [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] manager [[Tony Pulis]] and a trial was agreed.<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| pages = 83&ndash;85}}</ref>

===Portsmouth===
After friendly matches with [[Dorchester Town F.C.|Dorchester Town]] and [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]], Primus signed a contract with Portsmouth although he was disappointed with the low wages in comparison to other players.<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| pages = 88&ndash;90| chapter = All change at Pompey}}</ref> He did not get his Portsmouth career off to a good start, scoring an [[own goal]] on his debut away at [[Sheffield United F.C|Sheffield United]].<ref name="email convo"/> Pulis was sacked early on in the [[2000<U+2013>01 Football League|2000&ndash;01 season]] after a poor start and was replaced by fans' favourite [[Steve Claridge]].<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| pages = 94&ndash;97}}</ref> Portsmouth were still near the relegation zone after a poor run of form that also saw Primus being [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] for the first time in his career for a foul on [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]'s [[Louis Saha]].<ref name="p100">{{cite book| last= Primus| page = 100}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Old style with new class |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/Observer_Match_Report/0,,-31787,00.html |publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=2000-11-19 |accessdate=2010-02-18|last=Ridley|first=Ian}}</ref> [[Gilmore's groin]] ruled him out of action for five months from November of that season,<ref name="p100"/> during which Claridge was replaced by [[Graham Rix]],<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| page = 102}}</ref> this was after Primus formed a partnership with Jamaican international [[Darren Moore]].<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| page = 94}}</ref> 

Primus struggled to get a game under Rix but the appointment of [[Harry Redknapp]] in March 2002 gave him a new lease of life and he ended that season with two league goals in games against Bradford and Barnsley.<ref>{{cite web 
|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/1752859.stm|title=Bradford 3-1 Portsmouth|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2002-01-12 |accessdate=2009-09-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

Despite originally being told by Redknapp he was not of [[Football League First Division|Division One]] standard, let alone suitable for the [[Premier League]], Primus proved his manager wrong by seizing his chance when other players missed out through injury and suspension. By the end of the [[2002-03 in English football|2002<U+2013>03 season]] he had become a vital member of the side that won the First Division title, winning the Portsmouth fans' player of the season as well as the [[Professional Footballers' Association|PFA]] accolade for Division One.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fourfourtwo.com/blogs/fourfourtwoview/archive/2009/12/09/how-a-christian-soldier-set-a-primus-example.aspx|title=How a Christian soldier set a Primus example|publisher=''FourFourTwo''|date=2009-12-09 |accessdate=2010-01-04|last=Morgan|first=Steve}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.givemefootball.com/pfa-fans-awards/steven-gerrard-is-the-fans-favourite|title=Steven Gerrard is the fans' favourite|publisher=Give Me Football|date=2009-05-05 |accessdate=2010-01-04|last=Smith|first=Dave}}</ref> He scored once that season for Portsmouth in the League Cup against [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2239170.stm|title=Pompey 2-0 Peterborough|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2002-09-10 |accessdate=2009-11-04}}</ref> Primus credits his renaissance to his conversion to [[Christianity]] after a friend of his wife's invited him to church.<ref name="Faith in football">{{cite news |title=Faith In Football |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/southampton/faith/linvoy.shtml |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-09-01 |accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref>

[[Image:Sol-Campbell.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sol Campbell was Primus' partner in defence for the majority of the [[2006<U+2013>07 FA Premier League|2006&ndash;07 season]].]]

Despite the previous season's heroics, Primus was not used regularly in the early part of Portsmouth's first Premier League season. Harry Redknapp had ditched his 3&ndash;5&ndash;2 formation in favour of the more conventional 4&ndash;4&ndash;2 and partnered new record signing [[Dejan Stefanovi<U+0107>]] with [[Arjan de Zeeuw]]. During December, Portsmouth were in a terrible run of form and Redknapp decided to bring one of his most reliable players back into his plans for the [[derby match]] with [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. In spite of a 3&ndash;0 loss, Primus retained his starting place for the remainder of the season.

The following season saw Primus remain a regular member of the Portsmouth team under first Redknapp and then both his successors, [[Velimir Zajec]] and [[Alain Perrin]]. He scored his first Premier League goal at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on [[Boxing Day]] 2004.<ref>{{cite news |title=Palace 0-1 Portsmouth: Primus winner |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=153690&cc=5739 |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |date=2004-12-26 |accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref> He scored again on Boxing Day in 2006, when grabbing two headed goals against [[West Ham United]].<ref>{{cite web

Although Primus was a regular member of Perrin's team at the end of the [[FA Premier League 2004-05|2004&ndash;05 season]] and captained the side on occasions during pre-season, he rarely featured until Perrin's sacking in November. The return of [[Harry Redknapp]], who had been won over by his performances and was now one of his biggest admirers, to Portsmouth lead to Primus' immediate return to the side, and he was ever present in the side that achieved Premiership survival in the last 10 games of the season. Primus remained a regular in the Portsmouth defence for the [[2006<U+2013>07 FA Premier League|2006&ndash;07 season]], partnering England international [[Sol Campbell]] in the centre of defence,<ref>{{cite news |title=Sol Campbell Bio |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8049&cc=5739 |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |accessdate=2009-12-25}}</ref><ref name="Linvoy ESPN Bio">{{cite news |title=Linvoy Primus Bio |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=5382&cc=5739 |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |accessdate=2009-12-25}}</ref> and Redknapp hailed him as the unofficial Player of the Season; the official winner of the award was [[David James (footballer)|David James]].<ref name="Linvoy ESPN Bio"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Johnson named your Pompey Player of the Season|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/frattonlatest/Johnson-named-your-Pompey-Player.5293772.jp |publisher=Portsmouth News|accessdate=2009-12-25|date=2009-05-22|last=Allen|first=Neil}}</ref> He failed to make an appearance in 2007&ndash;08 due to a career threatening [[knee]] injury. He was treated with surgery performed by Dr. [[Richard Steadman]] who is known to have saved the careers of many Premiership footballers, including [[Alan Shearer]] and [[Ronaldo]]. After the operation, Primus commented "The difference between success and failure is what you do afterwards in your rehabilitation, not necessarily the actual operation."<ref>{{cite news |title=Fine line between playing on and retiring for Linvoy |url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/behind-the-scenes/Fine-line-between-playing-on.3615674.jp |publisher=Portsmouth News |date=2007-12-22 |accessdate=2009-12-25}}</ref> Despite his injury, he still managed to earn a new one-year deal at Portsmouth in May 2008.<ref>{{cite news |title=New deal for loyal Linvoy |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-sport/article-23483060-new-deal-for-loyal-linvoy.do |publisher=''London Evening Standard'' |date=2008-05-08 |accessdate=2009-12-25}}</ref>

===Charlton Athletic loan and Portsmouth return===
In August 2008, Primus returned to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on a loan deal, however the deal almost collapsed as negotiations broke down between Portsmouth manager [[Harry Redknapp]] and Charlton manager Alan Pardew. Pardew wanted the centre half for the whole of the [[2008<U+2013>09 in English football|2008&ndash;09 season]], but Redknapp was only happy to loan him out until Christmas of 2008 in order to gain match fitness, and it appeared the deal would be called off by Portsmouth.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pompey call off Primus loan |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_4055882,00.html |publisher=Sky Sports |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2008-08-27}}</ref> Finally Charlton agreed to the terms and Primus move to the Valley on a three month loan days before the transfer window closed.<ref>{{cite news |title=Primus moves to Charlton on loan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/charlton_athletic/7580640.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-08-28 |accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref> He scored his first goal for Charlton in a 5&ndash;2 home defeat to Sheffield United.

After a near two year absence, Primus made a comeback to the Portsmouth first team on 18 May 2009, the penultimate game of the 2008&ndash;09 season, as a late substitute appearance against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] at Fratton Park. He received a standing ovation from the home crowd and was cheered each time he touched the ball.<ref>{{cite news |title=Portsmouth v Sunderland as it happened (2152/2154) |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8056449.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2009-05-18 |accessdate=2009-05-19}}</ref>

Primus signed a one-year extension to his contract with Portsmouth in July 2009. Primus also agreed to take on an ambassadorial and advisory role to help guide emerging talent at Portsmouth, as well as a playing role.<ref>{{cite news |title=Primus extends stay at Portsmouth|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/8132817.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2009-07-03 |accessdate=2009-12-25}}</ref> On 8 December 2009, Primus announced his retirement due to a knee injury.<ref>{{cite news |title=Primus calls time on career|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/2763037/Linvoy-Primus-announces-his-retirement.html |publisher=''The Sun'' |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2009-12-25}}</ref> Portsmouth's chief executive [[Peter Storrie]] confirmed that Primus would retain his ambassadorial role.<ref name="Guardian Primus retires">{{cite news |title=Portsmouth's Linvoy Primus retires from football|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/dec/08/linvoy-primus-portsmouth-retirement |publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2010-01-04}}</ref>

==Personal life==
At the age of 17, Primus met his wife Trish through a mutual friend.<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| page = 35}}</ref> After 18 months of the relationship, they decided to have a child which Primus' parents strongly disapproved of. The footballer himself said in his autobiography, "Up until then I had been the model son and had brought no trouble to their door, but now they were upset at what they saw as my rebellion".<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| page = 37}}</ref> On November 1993, their first son Nathan was born.<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| page = 38}}</ref> He also has a daughter called Atlanta, born in April 1997.<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| page = 16}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| page = 55}}</ref> They were married on 9 June 1999.<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| page = 74}}</ref> 

In 2007, he released his autobiography, "Transformed", which was co-written by Peter Jeffs.<ref>{{cite news |title=Faith > Linvoy Primus| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/hampshire/content/articles/2007/09/05/linvoy_biog_feature.shtml |publisher=BBC Hampshire |date=2007-09-06|accessdate=2009-12-25}}</ref> The book received generally positive reviews: ''[[Christianity Magazine]]'' said the book was a "disarmingly honest account of Primus<U+2019>s triumphs and struggles on and off the pitch"<ref>{{cite news|title=Review: Transformed - football, faith and me|url=http://christianitymagazine.co.uk/reviews/books/transformed%20-%20football%20faith%20and%20me.aspx|publisher=''Christianity Magazine''|date=2007-11-01|accessdate=2010-01-09|last=Buckeridge|first=John}}</ref> while ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' described it as "an antidote to the 'me-me-me' tales that weigh down the shelves"<ref>{{cite news |title=Linvoy Primus: Transformed - Publisher and industry reviews| url=http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/products/linvoy+primus/peter+jeffs/linvoy+primus/5973542/ |publisher=Waterstone's |accessdate=2010-01-04}}</ref> but rival football magazine ''[[When Saturday Comes]]'' was more critical, pointing out its "sometimes ungrammatical and often ponderous style" and going on to say "[the] book is also full of cliches".<ref>{{cite news |title=BOOK REVIEWS  Players  Transformed| url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/1032/28/ |publisher=''When Saturday Comes'' |accessdate=2010-01-04|last=Brown|first=Matthew}}</ref>

==Charitable and Christian work==

Trish suffered from [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and was introduced to [[Christianity]] by stable owners, Keith and Sam, who invited the Primus family to join them at church on a Sunday. Initially, Primus was reluctant but Trish convinced him to accept and Primus remarked that it was a case of "well church is the last place we'd go, but why not?" The church was more "laid-back" in comparison to the one that Primus attended as a child and he, along with the rest of his family, became regular churchgoers.<ref>{{cite book| last= Primus| pages = 109&ndash;111}}</ref> Trish's depression was lifted and Primus later [[conversion to Christianity|converted to Christianity]], "In my heart I felt whole and complete, and I wanted to read the Bible at every opportunity."<ref name="Southend Christians"/>
