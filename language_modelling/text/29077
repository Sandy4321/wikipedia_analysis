'''Richard Basset''' (died between 1135 and 1144) was an English royal judge and sheriff during the reign of King [[Henry I of England]]. His father was also a royal justice. In about 1122 Basset married the eventual heiress of another other royal justice; the marriage settlement has survived. In 1129 and 1130 Basset was sheriff of a number of counties together with another nobleman. Basset and his wife founded a monastic house in 1125 from of their lands, which before the donation were equivalent to 15 [[Knight's fee|knight's fees]]. After Basset's death between 1135 and 1144 his lands were granted to his son.

==Early life==

Basset was the son of [[Ralph Basset]],<ref name=DD>Keats-Rohan ''Domesday Descendants'' p. 166</ref> who was also a royal justice under Henry I. It is unclear whether Richard was Ralph's eldest son or not. Richard inherited Ralph's estates in [[Normandy]], which were near [[Montreuil-au-Houlme]]. He also inherited his father's English estates at Colston Basset, Kingston Winslow, and Peatling Parva. Basset's brother Nicholas signed over his own inheritance to Richard.<ref name=Green231/> Ralph Basset was one of the "new men" of Henry I, and his son was also considered to be so.<ref name=Newman73>Newman ''Anglo-Norman Nobility'' p. 73</ref><ref name=Newman102>Newman ''Anglo-Norman Nobility'' p. 102</ref> William Basset, the [[abbot]] of the [[Benedictine Order|Benedictine]] monastery of the abbey of [[St Benet's Abbey|St Benet of Hulme]], may have been a relative, as he granted lands to Richard Basset in return for a <U+20A4>10 annual rent.<ref name=Newman149>Newman ''Anglo-Norman Nobility'' pp. 149<U+2013>150</ref> Another relative may have been the Robert Basset who nine times witnessed charters of [[Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester|Ranulf de Gernon]], [[Earl of Chester]].<ref name=Aristo213>Green ''Aristocracy of Norman England'' p. 213</ref>

==Royal service==

Basset served as [[Sheriff of Buckinghamshire]] and [[Sheriff of Huntingdonshire]], together with Aubrey de Vere, in 1129 and 1130.<ref name=DD/> He was also sheriff with de Vere in the counties of [[High Sheriff of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire|Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire]], [[High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire|Cambridgeshire]], [[High Sheriff of Essex|Essex]], [[High Sheriff of Hertfordshire|Hertfordshire]], [[High Sheriff of Leicestershire|Leicestershire]], [[High Sheriff of Northamptonshire|Northamptonshire]], [[High Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk|Norfolk and Suffolk]], and [[High Sheriff of Surrey|Surrey]].<ref name=Green231>Green ''Government of England'' pp. 231<U+2013>232</ref> The number of shrievalties was unusual, and is known from the [[Pipe Roll]] of 1130. According to the entries in the Pipe Roll, de Vere and Basset did not function as traditional sheriffs in their counties, farming the revenues, but were instead responsible for the entire royal revenue in those counties.<ref name=Henryi360>Hollister ''Henry I'' p. 360</ref>

As well as his service as a sheriff, Basset also served as a royal justice, hearing pleas in Leicestershire in 1129 and 1130.<ref name=Aristo249>Green ''Aristocracy of Norman England'' p. 249</ref> Other royal service included being sent to [[Peterborough Abbey]] in 1125 to oversee the abbey's lands after the death of the abbot. The revenues of a vacant abbey went to the king, and Basset's job was to secure Peterborough's income for King Henry.<ref name=Aristo267>Green ''Aristocracy of Norman England'' p. 267</ref> Between 1131 and 1133 Basset appears to have been a frequent attendee at the royal court, as he witnessed a number of documents. Included among these attestations are some originating at the councils held at Northampton in 1131 and another at Westminster in 1132. Basset witnessed no royal documents after 1133, when King Henry left for Normandy for the final time.<ref name=DNB>Green "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1647 Basset, Richard (d. in or before 1144)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>

After King Henry's death in 1135, Basset was not employed as a royal official, either as a justice or as a sheriff. He appears once as a witness to a charter of Stephen's in 1136, but the authenticity of this document has been questioned. He had built a castle in Normandy at [[Montreuil-au-Houlme]], but it was not held by him in 1136, when it was held against Stephen's opponents by [[William de Montpincon]].<ref name=DNB/>

==Lands==

Basset held lands that totaled approximately 176 [[Hide (unit)|hide]]s, but they did not form a compact estate, as they were spread over 11 counties.<ref name=Newman126>Newman ''Anglo-Norman Nobility'' p. 126</ref> In 1135, Basset's lands totalled 184.25 [[carucate]]s of land, and were considered to be the equivalent of 15 knight's fees. These lands would have been about {{convert|1500|acre|ha}}, calculateded at the normal rate of about {{convert|120|acre|ha}} per carucate.<ref name=Bartlett222>Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 222</ref>

Basset founded an [[Augustinian Order]] priory at [[Launde]] in Leicestershire,<ref name=Aristo403>Green ''Aristocracy of Norman England'' pp. 403<U+2013>404</ref> together with his wife.<ref name=DNB/> This priory, [[Launde Abbey|Launde Priory]], was founded by 1125, and was endowed with the village of [[Loddington]] in Leicestershire and a number of churches in that county and others.<ref name=VCH>Hoskins "[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=38161 Houses of Augustinian canons: The priory of Launde]" ''History of the County of Leicestershire''</ref>

==Family and death==

Basset married Matilda, the daughter and eventual heiress of [[Geoffrey Ridel (royal justice)|Geoffrey Ridel]], some time between 1120 and 1123.<ref name=DD/> Matilda had a brother Robert, who was mentioned in her [[marriage settlement]], by the terms of the settlement Robert Ridel was placed in the wardship of Basset until he was knighted and married.<ref name=Green231/> The document of the marriage settlement survives, and describes Matilda's [[dowry]] as being worth four [[knight's fee]]s.<ref name=Newman82/> Basset also received the right to arrange Matlida's sister's marriages and was to marry Robert Ridel to Basset's niece, with Robert's lands reverting to Basset if Robert had no children.<ref name=Newman82>Newman ''Anglo-Norman Nobility'' p. 82</ref> Not long after the settlement was written, Basset was in possession of the lands that should have been Robert's.<ref name=Green231/>

Basset witnessed a royal charter in 1135 but was dead by 1144, when his lands were granted by the [[Empress Matilda]] and her son [[Henry II of England|Henry]] to Richard's son [[Geoffrey II Ridel|Geoffrey Ridel]]. Other sons were Ralph Basset, who held lands near Drayton, and William Basset, who held lands near Sapcote.<ref name=DD/> William became a royal justice and sheriff like his father.<ref name=DNB/> The elder Basset had two daughters: Sibil, who married Robert de Cauz, and Matilda, who married John de Stuteville.<ref name=DD/> Ralph inherited the ancestral lands in Normandy.<ref name=Green231/> The Norman chronicler [[Orderic Vitalis]] wrote that Basset built a tower on his anccestral lands of Montreuil in Normandy, purely to increase his own importance.<ref name=Newman73/>
