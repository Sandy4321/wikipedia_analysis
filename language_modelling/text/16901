{{Quotation|Palazhchenko loves his trade.  In his book, '''My Unsystematic Dictionary''', Palazhchenko writes:  ''This very occupation, to imbibe the air of a foreign (and your own) language, to rake through the throng of words and, having found the right one, feel its texture, its size and then grope for the threads connecting the two languages, has always been my favorite thing to do<U+2026>'' - from <U+201C>Book Tackles Those Hard Words<U+201D>, The Moscow Times, June 3, 2002.<ref name=TMT/>}}

In 2005, the third book of this series, ''Unsystematic Dictionary-2005'' was published.<ref>[http://www.gorby.ru/rubrs.asp?art_id=24622&rubr_id=20&page=1 News article about the press conference for the book ''Unsystematic Dictionary-2005'']</ref>
