'''D12''', an [[initialism]] for '''The Dirty Dozen''', is an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group from [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. D12 has had chart-topping albums in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.d12world.com/chart_success.php |title=D12 Chart Success |publisher=D12 WORLD |accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref> D12 was formed in 1996, and achieved mainstream success after [[Eminem]] rose to international fame.<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Kerry L.|title=D12 > Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p457773/biography|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|date=May 20, 2008|accessdate=March 13, 2010}}</ref> D12 released the album ''[[Devil's Night (album)|Devil's Night]]'' in 2001 and ''[[D12 World]]'' in 2004, spawning numerous hits such as "[[Fight Music]]", "[[Purple Pills]]", "[[My Band]]", "[[How Come]]" and "[[Shit on You]]" throughout that period. Since 2006, [[Eminem]]'s hiatus and the death of the member [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]] resulted in them being less active in subsequent years.

==History==

===Early career (1996-2001)===
In order to make up the dozen, it was decided the six members at the time would each create an alter-ego. Proof's was Dirty Harry, Bizarre's was Peter S. Bizarre, Kuniva's was Hannz G. (which later became Rondell Beene), Kon Artis's was Mr. Porter, Bugz' was Robert Beck and Eminem created the famous character Slim Shady.

In 1997, they released their debut album, ''[[The Underground EP]]'', which was recorded between 1996 and 1997. In 1997 and through 1998, its members began establishing reputations locally. Bizarre was named ''Inner City Entertainment'''s "Flava of the Week" and went on to release an album called ''[[Attack of the Weirdos]]''. Along with Eminem, [[Rah Digga]] and [[Young Zee]], he became an honorary member of ''[[Outsidaz|The Outsidaz]]''. Proof won a [[freestyle music|freestyling]] competition run by ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]''. In 1999, Bugz released an EP called ''These Streets EP'', and made several appearances on other rapper's songs.

D12 went through many changes during the early days even becoming temporarily inactive when, after being heard by Dr. Dre, Eminem left to pursue a solo career. Around the time of Eminem's first record deal, Proof attempted to bring new life to D12. He managed to recruit local Detroit hip hop duo Da Brigade, which was composed of Kuniva, a local MC, and Denaun Porter, a longtime friend of Eminem and Proof. At the time, Porter was the group's producer and later produced Eminem's first album ''[[Infinite (Eminem album)|Infinite]]'', but was persuaded by his partner Kuniva to join him in the group as an artist. Later the group was joined by Bugz and needing one more member, Bugz introduced his long time friend Swift, who at the time was a member of rap duo Da Rabeez.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

====Death of Bugz (1999)====
Prior to a show in Detroit, Bugz attended a picnic at which an incident took place that led to his fatal assault. An argument with a man over a water-pistol fight escalated, the man went to his [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]] to retrieve a firearm which he then fired in Bugz' direction. He was shot four times as well as being hit by the assailant's vehicle as he fled the scene. The incident, on May 21, 1999, was captured on video and shown later that day on local news.

Members of the group were shaken by the tragic incident, darkening the mood within the collective. One of his final acts had been to request that Swift join the group.<ref name="d12worldswift">{{cite web|title=D12World.com: Swift member page |url=http://www.d12world.com/index.php?s=swift |publisher=D12 World|year=2001}}</ref> Following the death of Bugz, Eminem volunteered as replacement in order to fulfill the group's forthcoming obligations. This led to Eminem eventually rejoining the group.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eminem: Rolling The Dice On D12 |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/d/d12/news_feature_042304/index2.jhtml |publisher=MTVNews.com |author=Joseph Patel, with reporting by Rahman Bugg}}</ref>

At the time of his dead, Bugz was working on his first solo album, ''Mr. Obnoxious'', which was eventually released posthumously in February 2000. D12 recorded their debut album, ''[[Devil's Night]]'', in his memory. Eminem's third album, ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'', is also dedicated to him. The track "Good Die Young", released on D12's second album, ''[[D12 World]]'', is about Bugz. The album also includes a song titled "Bugz '97", which is a 1997 recording originally from the song "Desperados".

===Success (2001-2006)===
The group has released two albums, ''[[Devil's Night (album)|Devil's Night]]'' and ''[[D12 World]]''. Both albums debuted at number one on the Billboard music charts in the U.S. and topped the charts in many other countries. The two albums' hit singles included "[[Purple Pills]]", "[[Fight Music]]", "[[My Band]]", and "[[How Come]]".

In August 2001, D12 and [[Esham]] were kicked off the [[Warped Tour]] after members of the group allegedly physically attacked Esham over the lyrics of his song "Chemical Imbalance," which contained a reference to Eminem's daughter. Eminem was not present during the tour.<ref>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Moriates |title=Rappers Esham, D12 kicked off Warped Tour after alleged attack |url=http://dailybruin.com/archives/id/15893/ |work=The Daily Bruin |date=August 13, 2001 |accessdate=2008-07-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hasted |first=Nick |editor= |others= |title=The Dark Story of Eminem |year=2005 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=1-84449-726-7 |page=151 |chapter=The Waiting Room}}</ref>

The group was often overshadowed by Eminem's massive success, and toured without him for the second album while Eminem was busy recording ''[[Encore (Eminem album)|Encore]]''. Although shadowed by [[Eminem]]'s success, other members [[Bizarre (rapper)|Bizarre]] and [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]] managed to prevail with mildly successful solo careers with the releases of ''[[Hannicap Circus]]'' and ''[[Searching for Jerry Garcia]]'' in 2005. D12 (minus Eminem) appeared on [[Tech N9ne]]'s 2002 album entitled ''Absolute Power'' on the track "She-Devil". They also decided that Eminem would not be as prominent on their upcoming third album, which remains evident even after Proof's death. Their third album is estimated to be 70% completed without any input from Eminem. However, in June 2009, Eminem confirmed he was also working hard on the group's 3rd studio album on an announcement made on Rap city during an interview with Eminem and Denaun Porter.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hip-hop's Porter puts beats up for sale on Web |url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070621/ENT01/706210421/1033 |publisher=The Detroit News |date= June 21, 2007}}</ref> The group recorded a song for Eminem's album ''[[Recovery (Eminem album)|Recovery]]'' titled "Hit me With Your Best Shot," but it was not featured on the official album.<ref>{{cite web|last=Phillips |first=Rashad |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.10875/title.d12s-bizarre-talks-relapse-2-canibus-diss-track |title=D12's Bizarre Talks Relapse 2, Canibus Diss Track &#124; Get The Latest Hip Hop News, Rap News & Hip Hop Album Sales |publisher=HipHop DX |date=2010-03-23 |accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref>

===Death of Proof, hiatus and potential third album (2006-present)===
{{See also|Proof (rapper)}}
On April 11, 2006, Proof died from a gunshot wound at a club in Detroit, after allegedly fatally shooting Keith Bender, Jr., following an argument over a game of pool. Proof was then shot by the bouncer Mario Etheridge, Bender's cousin. At St. John Health's Conner Creek Campus, he was pronounced dead on arrival shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jessica|last=Robertson|title=D12 Rapper Proof Fatally Shot|date=2006-04-11|work=Rolling Stone @ RollingStone.com|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/9747473/d12_rapper_proof_fatally_shot}}</ref> He was buried on April 19 in The Fellowship Chapel, Detroit, to a full house of 2,660 with thousands mourning outside.<ref>{{cite news|title=D12, Eminem, 50 Cent and Others Attend Proof's Funeral|date=2006-04-20|publisher=SixShot.com|url=http://www.sixshot.com/news/6031}}</ref>

Swift was arrested in [[Novi, Michigan]] on April 21, 2006, after failing to appear in court. It was due to his attendance as an honorary [[pallbearer]] at the funeral of group member Proof. Already on probation for a [[DUI]] offence, for which he'd served two days in October 2005, he was sentenced by District Court Judge Brian MacKenzie to 93 days in jail for violating the terms of the probation. It resulted in the stalling of recording for D12's third album. Following his release, work commenced on the album.

On May 21, 2008, after 4 years drought and the passing of Proof, D12 released a new mixtape, ''Return of the Dozen Vol. 1''. The mixtape was designed to get D12 back on their feet, in preparation for new possible content. The mixtape lacked appearance from Eminem (who was working on his solo album, ''[[Relapse (Eminem album)|Relapse]]''). It contains several guest features from rappers such as [[Royce da 5'9"]] (whom they had a feud with) and King Gordy. Some tracks were solo performances from a D12 member, such "If You Want It" by Kuniva, in a similar way to how Eminem performed "Girls" from ''[[Devil's Night (album)|Devil's Night]]''.<ref name="return of the dozen 1">{{cite web|title=D12 Return of the Dozen (Vol 1) mixtape |url=http://www.rapbasement.com/features/features/d12-return-of-the-dozen.html|publisher=Rapbasement}}</ref>

D12 released their mixtape ''Return of the Dozen Vol. 2'' on April 12, 2011, which featured Fuzz Scoota. Eminem was only present on one track throughout the whole mixtape, though he wasn't present at all in the previous one. Due to Eminem being on tour for his album Recovery and because of Mr. Porter being his current hype man there are were four active members of D12 at the time (Bizarre, Kuniva, Fuzz and Swift). The others, while not currently active, were still members of D12. In a video posted on YouTube by Eminem & Royce da 5'9" on June 13, 2011, Eminem stated that he was back in the studio with D12 after not being a very active member for nearly three years.<ref name="return of the dozen 2">{{cite web|title=Facebook: D12 announce through Facebook that Eminem will feature in Return of the Dozen 2 |url=http://www.facebook.com/d12fb/posts/140443892691383 |publisher=Facebook}}</ref> D12 performed at the [[Kanrocksas Music Festival]] on August 5, 2011.<ref name="kanrocksas">{{cite web|title=D12 <U+2013> Artist Lineup <U+2013> Kanrocksas Music Festival|url=http://kanrocksas.com/lineup/single/d12 |publisher=Kanrocksas Music Festival}}</ref>

The track, "Outro", off the ''Return of the Dozen Vol. 2'' mixtape, had a music video released on September 1, 2011, though the video did not feature either Eminem or Mr. Porter. The group also stated intentions to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the release of the ''Devils Night'' album, though the celebration was held on the actual Devil's Night on October 30 in [[St. Andrew's Hall]] in Detroit, Michigan, even though the album was released months earlier on June 19, 2001.<ref name="D12 Release Music Video for 'Outro', Announce Party">{{cite news |publisher=AceShowbiz |title=D12 Release Music Video for 'Outro', Announce Party |date=September 2, 2011}}<!-- blacklisted |url=http://www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/00043371.html |accessdate=September 2, 2011--></ref> Fuzz Scoota was one of the original members of D12 but left in 1999. He then later joined back with D12 on April 7, 2011.<ref name="www.hiphopdx.com">{{cite web |title=D12 Welcomes New Member Fuzz Scoota |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.14672/title.d12-welcomes-new-member-fuzz-scoota |accessdate=29 October 2012}}</ref>

In 2012, Bizarre left the group, citing creative differences.<ref name=proter>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisis50.com/profiles/blogs/denaun-aka-kon-artist-leaves-d12 |title=Denaun aka Kon Artist Leaves D12 |publisher=ThisIs50.com |date=2012-03-25 |accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref> That same year, March 24, Mr. Porter announced that he had left D12 via a series of tweets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2012/03/26/mr-porter-leaves-d12-shifts-focus-to-solo-debut/ |title=Mr. Porter Leaves D12, Shifts Focus To Solo Debut |publisher=BallerStatus.com|date=2012-03-26}}</ref> In the Twitter posts, he said that he wanted to focus on being a solo artist, but clarified that holds no animosity toward other members of the group. The group now currently has only four members.

While promoting his recent mixtape, Kuniva was interviewed in August 2012 about the group's status. He replied that it's "not over, we're still coming." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hulkshare.com/utspp0dtrm68 |title=Kuniva talks about new mixtape, Slaughterhouse and D12 |date= 2012-08-27}}</ref> He went on to state that D12 had been back in the studio as a whole. Former D12 member [[Mr. Porter]] was asked on [[Twitter]] on January 26, 2013 about a possible new D12 album. He responded "Not happening bro sorry". This suggests that rumours of a third D12 album are false, or it is simply a clarification that he will not appear on the album. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MrPorter2012/status/295055478193520640 |title=Twitter / MrPorter2012: Not happening bro sorry RT |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref>

==Feuds==

===Natas===
A rivalry with a fellow Detroit-based group known as [[Natas (group)|Natas]] began in the late 1990s, when D12 opened for [[Lil' Kim]] at her Detroit show. It is alleged that Natas band member [[Esham]] Smith was attacked by a group of D12 associates after he was invited onstage and subsequently out performed them. Initially, D12 member Eminem was on good terms with Natas, but the two had a falling out when he criticized Esham's second album. In speaking with Murder Dog, Esham responded to D12 calling them "the Village People of rap," Eminem "a super bitch," and making reference to Eminem's daughter, Hailie, being in a coma, on the track "Chemical Imbalance". D12, in turn, responded with the song "Instigator", dissing Natas, while Proof made 2 diss tracks aimed specifically at Esham, "Every Sucker Has A Moment" and "Uh Huh", though the latter was not released.<ref>[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Esham?from=Main.Esham Esham - Television Tropes & Idioms]</ref>
Both sides tried to make amends prior to joining the [[Warped Tour]] 2001. However a fight was provoked, after Esham allegedly threw items at D12's tour bus. Smith sustained a broken nose, bruised eardrum, a temporary loss of hearing, and multiple cuts and bruises, according his label's spokeswoman. Natas member [[Mastamind]] sustained multiple cuts and bruises. Both groups were removed from the Warped Tour line up, and banned from ever performing at the festival again.<ref>Feud with Rap group Ntas (Rollingstone.com)[http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/d12-booted-from-warped-20010806] Retrieved 2012-02-23</ref>

===Royce da 5'9"===
When first signed to Aftermath entertainment, Eminem was not on good terms with the rest of D12, causing him to initially only focus on furthering the career of his [[Bad Meets Evil]] band mate [[Royce da 5'9"]]. Royce performed on Eminem's first solo album the [[Slim Shady LP]], and acted as his hypeman for the first weeks of his d<U+00E9>but tour. Eminem eventually reconciled with D12, and also began giving time to establishing their career. This caused a number of projects Royce had planned with Eminem, to be postponed indefinitely. In protest, he resigned as Eminem's hypeman, with the position being taken up by Proof. D12 saw this as a betrayal to Eminem, as the resignation came at the awkward time of halfway through his first tour. This resulted in an immediate falling out between Royce da 5'9" and D12, with a drawn-out, public rivalry between the rapper and five of the six members ensuing.<ref>Film Beef II, 62 mins in(Youtube.com)[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgPznfn-rek] Retrieved 2012-02-26</ref> Royce releasing three diss tracks aimed at the group. The first diss track, "Shit On You", was recorded over D12's Shit On You instrumental' and mainly attacked group member Bizarre. "Malcolm X" was the second diss track, which featured Tr<U+00E9> Little. D12 responded with "Smack Down" which was recorded over 50 Cent's "Back Down" instrumental. Proof also recorded a diss track entitled "Many Men". This was recorded over 50 Cent's "Many Men (Wish Death)" instrumental. Proof later released another diss with The Purple Gang called "Beef Is Ova". Royce responded with his third diss track, which was recorded over 50 Cent's "In Da Club" instrumental titled "Death Day". In the Summer of 2003, D12 member Proof confronted Royce da 5'9" outside a club in Detroit. Violence erupted between the rappers' entourage, leading to the Police being called, and Proof and Royce's arrest. The two were detained overnight in adjacent cells where they talked out their differences and ended the feud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgPznfn-rek&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL |title=Beef 2 |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref> A few years later Royce would feature on D12's mixtape, Return Of the Dozen, as well as on the line-up of their following tour of Europe and Canada.

===Canibus===
During the time Eminem and [[Mr. Porter]] started recording ''[[Recovery (Eminem album)|Recovery]]'' the rest of D12 were featured on a diss song towards Eminem with rapper [[Canibus]], who had already had a feud with Eminem off his new record ''[[Melatonin Magik]]'' which was called "Air Strike (Pop Killer)". Canibus name-dropped Eminem's long time deceased friend [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]], Canibus said "If Proof Was Alive He'd Be Dying Inside". D12 member Swift responded to the record publicly, and had the following to say about DZK (another rapper featured on the track). "[He] asked us to do a track with him when he already was teamed up with Canibus without us knowing. They dissed Em, took our verses and added them to the song so they can bring traffic and make it seem like we turning on Em... as a desperate attempt to be heard after ducking and dodging Em for 7 years. It was a straight hoe move."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapbasement.com/d12/112509-d12-responds-to-the-canibus-diss-of-eminem-that-included-verses-from-the-dirty-dozen.html |title=D12 Responds To Fake Eminem Diss &#124; D12 |publisher=Rap Basement |date=2009-11-25 |accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref>

==Chart success==
Their debut album, ''[[Devil's Night (album)|Devil's Night]]'', referring to the [[Devil's Night|tradition]] of setting unoccupied buildings on fire the night before [[Halloween]], was released in June 2001. It debuted at number one on the U.S. and number two on the UK chart,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> also reaching the top of the Canadian charts.
