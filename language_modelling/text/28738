[[File:JosephMartin.jpg|thumb|right|300px|General Joseph Martin (1740<U+2013>1808), born [[Caroline County, Virginia]], died [[Henry County, Virginia]].]]
'''Joseph Martin''' (1740<U+2013>1808) was a [[brigadier general]] in the [[Virginia militia]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], in which Martin's frontier diplomacy with the [[Cherokee|Cherokee people]] is credited with not only averting Indian attacks on the [[Scotch-Irish American]] and [[English American]] settlers who helped win the battles of [[Battle of Kings Mountain|Kings Mountain]] and [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]], but with also helping to keep the Indians' position neutral and from siding with the British troops during those crucial battles. Historians agree that the settlers' success at these two battles signaled the turning of the tide of the Revolutionary War<U+2014>in favor of the Americans.
 
Martin was born in [[Caroline County, Virginia]], and later lived at Albemarle County and then at Henry County, Virginia, at his plantation, "Belmont," on Leatherwood Creek in Martinsville, not far from the plantation of his friend [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] [[Patrick Henry]], "Leatherwood."

General Martin held many positions during his public life. As a very young man he first tried his hand at farming, next he worked for three years as an overseer on the huge plantation of his local Virginia kin, next he was a [[longhunter]], and an explorer on the frontier for friend Patrick Henry, then an early pioneer and builder of Martin's Station in the "wild west," a surveyor of the KY/NC and TN/VA borders, an Indian agent/Indian fighter for Patrick Henry, a member at peace treaties with the Indians, and along with Dr. Thomas Walker, Joseph Martin named the Cumberland region and the [[Cumberland River]], he served as a member of the legislatures of Virginia, Georgia, and North Carolina, he was lifelong friends with Gen. Thomas Sumter, he was also friends and brothers-in-law with Col. Benjamin Cleveland (both married Graves sisters), he was unsuccessfully nominated by Patrick Henry to the position of the first governor of the Southwest Territory, was the holder of some 80,000 acres across the Southeastern U.S. at one point. The city of [[Martinsville, Virginia]], was named in his honor during his lifetime.

But Joseph Martin Jr., the son of the English immigrant, was not cut out for a Virginia gentry planter's life. "Gambling was a favorite pastime." Martin's son, Revolutionary War officer Col. William Martin, in his accounts of his father's life in the, "[[Lyman Draper]] Manuscript Collection," writes that although his father gambled, he was not much of a drinker and let his son in on his secret; Martin sometimes pretended to over-drink so he might appear to be drunk in order that fellow gamblers would let down their guard. As a youth, Joseph Martin ran off from an apprenticeship during the [[French and Indian War]] of 1756, and joined the army at [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]], where he served alongside another Virginia youth, [[Thomas Sumter]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RvIOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA164&dq=%22general+joseph+martin%22&lr=&ei=-Cd6Sf60DpeMlQTVoNm-Bg#PPA164,M1 |title=The Magazine of History with Notes and Queries, Vol. VIII, William Abbatt (ed.), New York, 1908 |publisher=Google Books |date=October 10, 2007 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref> Following his early army service, Martin lit out for the rigors of the frontier, where he dressed in buckskin and was an early real estate speculator, trapper and fur trader and Indian fighter.<ref>Although Joseph Martin inherited from his father over 300 acres of land as well as a half-interest in a plantation on a tributary of the [[Potomac River]] that Joseph Martin Sr. held jointly with Col. Francis Warner of [[Essex County, Virginia|Essex County]], the son elected to dress in buckskin and spend his time inland on the frontier.[http://listsearches.rootsweb.com/th/read/MARTIN/2000-11/0975121791]</ref>
But this time on the frontier was after Martin had bought a large plot of land in Henry County with his earnings working for three years as an overseer for an uncle. Martin also gained 20,000 acres of land from Patrick Henry in a surveying contest at Powell Valley. Martin's youthful adventures on the frontier were grist for later stories... some of which were written by Martin's political foes and were slanted to paint a picture of him in an unkind light. One writer, a fan of Martin's political enemy, called him lazy and refused to describe him by his military ranking. General Joseph Martin may have been many things in his lifetime, but a quick study of his history and his accomplishments show that he was far from lazy. Eventually the soldiering, trapping and Indian fighting transformed the young Martin into a fearsome explorer.

Among Martin's earliest excursions on the frontier was one made on behalf of family friend Dr. Thomas Walker. Martin's son, Revolutionary War officer Col. William Martin, describes the naming of the area and the river in a letter to historian [[Lyman Draper]], "A treaty with the Cherokees was held at Fort Chiswell on New River, then a frontier. On the return of the chiefs home, Dr.[Thomas] Walker, a gentleman of distiction, and my father, [General] Joseph Martin, accompanied them. The Indians being guides, they passed through the place now called Cumberland Gap, where they discovered a fine spring. They still had a little rum remaining, and they drank to the health of the Duke of Cumberland. This gave rise to the name of Cumberland Mountain and Cumberland River."

In 1769, Martin journeyed to [[Powell River (Tennessee River)|Powell's Valley]] to attempt a settlement, a full {{convert|100|mi|km}} ahead of any previous settlement.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6npr_LGJH-cC&pg=PA274&lpg=PA274&dq=%22col.+william+martin%22+tennessee&source=bl&ots=J6eMitmFIN&sig=o0u3xyXnr4Iw5hUIJeb_vbVVOxc&hl=en&ei=aYC5ScO6FJX2MJrf_J4I&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=9&ct=result#PPA75,M1 |title=The Life of Daniel Boone, Lyman Copeland Draper, Ted Franklin Belue, Stackpole Books, 1998, ISBN 0-8117-0979-5 |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref> Martin and his party&nbsp;<U+2013> which included his son Brice and Mordecai Hord<ref>Born in [[Caroline County, Virginia]], Mordecai Hord was also an early settler of Henry County, where he settled on his plantation named ''Hordsville''.

But in the foray to Powell's Valley, Martin had established his credentials as a hard-bitten explorer. [[Daniel Boone]] and his party of explorers were stunned in 1769 when, upon their arrival in Powell's Valley, they discovered that Martin and his 20-man party had beaten them there.

"Martin was a robust figure in the history of the early frontier," according to the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] guide to the Old Dominion. "He was born in Albemarle County in 1740, ran away to fight Indians at 17, became an Indian agent, land agent, and officer of militia, fighting Indians all up and down the frontier. In 1774 he came to Henry County, established himself at Belle Monte on Leatherwood Creek, for nine years sat for his district in the general assembly, and in 1793 was made a brigadier general of state militia.  He was a brawny, picturesque man, more than six feet tall and the father of 18 children; wore buckled knee breeches and a great beard, braided and thrust inside his shirt."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z2VzSg9hfp0C&pg=PA611&dq=%22general+joseph+martin%22&lr=&ei=SCt6SZPaNpOmkQTouqTUBg |title='&#39;Virginia: A Guide to the Old Dominion'&#39;, Virginia Writers' Project, Federal Writers' Project, Oxford University Press, New York, 1956 |publisher=Google Books |date=January 1, 1972 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref>

Martin's diplomacy with the Cherokees in 1780<U+2013>81, wrote the American Historical Association, enabled the [[Continental Army]] to achieve victory over the English at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]], thus hastening the end of the conflict. On the eve of the [[Battle of Guilford Court House]], in February 1781, General [[Nathaniel Greene]] wrote Martin and seven other officers&nbsp;<U+2013> including [[John Sevier]], [[Arthur Campbell (Virginia)|Arthur Campbell]],  and [[William Christian (Virginia)|William Christian]]&nbsp;<U+2013> appointing them agents to treat with the Cherokees and Chicasaws "to afford the Said Tribes of Indians every mark of our good disposition towards them."

By the end of the Revolution, Martin's place as chief colonial Indian agent seemed secure.

Later, in a twist overlooked by most historians, Martin corresponded with [[Alexander McGillivray]], the leader of the [[Muscogee Creek|Creek]] Indians, who had [[Loyalist]] sentiments. In 1788 a letter from Martin to McGillivray was intercepted in which Martin professed to be interested in settling abroad. When the letter was discovered, the [[North Carolina General Assembly]] launched an investigation into Martin's conduct. But he was later exonerated when it turned out that he was acting as a spy on Patrick Henry's instructions to ferret out the nature of McGillivray's ties to the Spanish, who were then active in Florida.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=w_n6Cm3qjX0C&pg=PA344&dq=%22joseph+martin%22+%22patrick+henry%22&ei=HJ65SfeGCIjClQTz8sSiBQ#PPA344,M1 |title=The Conquest of the Old Southwest: The Romantic Story of the Early Pioneers Into Virginia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Kentucky, 1740<U+2013>1790, Archibald Henderson, The Century Company, New York, 1920 |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref>

General Martin and Governor Patrick Henry kept a longrunning correspondence through the years, some of which concerned real estate speculation. Other letters recounted Martin's dealings with the Indian tribes, as well as settlement efforts in Tennessee.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5hwLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=%22joseph+martin%22+%22patrick+henry%22&source=bl&ots=FxCfxmMUlR&sig=Hbj-jyV0kf5TQtmUBMT-fX05wFM&hl=en&ei=LJy5SdnYD5GYsAPB_9w-&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result#PPA28,M1 |title=Letters from Joseph Martin to Patrick Henry, Publications of the Southern History Association, Vol. VI, Published by the Association, Washington, D.C., 1902 |publisher=Google Books |date=May 16, 2006 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref> As late as 1790, Patrick Henry wrote Joseph Martin concerning a real estate investment, holding out that the hope, Henry noted, that Martin might finally capitalize on his long service to Virginia. "After all the Hazards you have run," Henry wrote, "that you have not acquired so much property as many others would have done in your situation, I was desirous to throw something in your way by which some fine lands would have been offered to you in our purchase." <ref name="WWHv3" />{{rp|409}}

==Career as an Indian agent==
[[File:Joseph Martin Henry Lee.gif|thumb|left|175px|Letter from Joseph Martin to Virginia Governor [[Henry Lee III|Henry Lee]] discussing [[Powell Valley]], ca 1791]]
Ultimately, General Martin lost his appointment as chief Indian agent. Martin's "manner of treating with the Indians necessarily prevented his appointment," Senator Richard Henry Lee informed Patrick Henry in September 1789. "At present no such office as a standing Indian agent is appointed. The Government of the Western Territory is charged with such affairs."<ref name="WWHv3" />{{rp|404}}

In some quarters Martin was seen as too lenient with the Indians, especially after an incident in 1786<ref>The previous year, in April 1785, Patrick Henry first warned Joseph Martin that the encroachment of settlers of the secessionist [[State of Franklin]], by usurping Cherokee lands without payment, was upsetting arrangements previously reached between the state of Virginia and the tribe. [http://books.google.com/books?id=eB5CAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA409&dq=%22joseph+martin%22+%22patrick+henry%22&ei=lrW5Sf_5Go-qkATYy937Cw#PPA294,M1]</ref> when several young Cherokee warriors were said to have murdered two white settlers near [[Clinch Mountain]]. The killings set off calls for retribution within the [[secessionist]] State of Franklin, and Martin found himself trying to mediate the dispute, and calm the settlers, while trying to prevent the angry Cherokees from joining with the Creeks.<ref>Early in the creation of the [[State of Franklin]], Joseph Martin had been elected by the Franklin Council to serve on the new colony's [[Privy Council]], but Martin wrote Henry that he had rejected the post, thinking that it would conflict with his duties as a Virginia agent to the Indians.[http://books.google.com/books?id=FpcLAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA275&dq=%22patrick+henry%22+%22joseph+martin%22&lr=&ei=zf-_ScKyC5DSkwSRqYmwCQ]</ref> Martin did little to disguise his contempt for the authorities of the State of Franklin, who, Martin wrote Henry, "immediately marched into the above mentioned Town, where they killed one Young [Indian] woman, and Shot Several others."<ref name="WWHv3" />{{rp|373}}

But Martin himself had not hesitated to wield military power against the Cherokees, especially when they killed several colonists at the instigation of Loyalist and English agents during the Revolution. In 1781, following a running battle between Indian forces and those of the colonists, [[Colonel]] [[Arthur Campbell (Virginia)|Arthur Campbell]],<ref>[[Campbell County, Tennessee]] was named for Virginia legislator Arthur Campbell.</ref> [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[John Sevier]] and Martin addressed a letter to the Indian chiefs, warning them about their actions. "You know you began the war," the bulletin began, "by listening to the bad councils of the [[King of England]] and the falsehoods told you by his agents." Further hostilities, the three colonial leaders warned, would result in a military campaign against the Indian villages.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DSUSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA278&dq=%27DANIEL+BOONE%22+%22JOSEPH+MARTIN%27&lr=&ei=7T27SaUdj8CVBM6HmdML#PPA346,M1 |title=History of Southwest Virginia, 1746<U+2013>1786, Washington County, 1777<U+2013>1870, Lewis Preston Summers, J.

But having eventually struck a hard-won peace with the tribes, Martin bridled at the actions of the State of Franklin. Henry empathized with Martin, writing the General in May 1785 that "the disorderly behavior of the Franklin people, as they call themselves, gives me concern. If they will not be subservient to the Rules and Regulations respecting Indian affairs, which prevail in all the States, they must expect none of the advantages of the Union."<ref>Henry, Martin and others saw the conduct of the State of Franklin settlers, who urged secession from the new union, as endangering much of what had been accomplished on the frontier. They also saw it in economic terms as driving a wedge between the newly created states and perhaps encouraging encroachment by the always-feared Spanish interests, especially on the Mississippi and in the western territories. As large land speculators, this fear was probably uppermost in the minds of many Virginia gentry.[http://books.google.com/books?id=eB5CAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA409&dq=%22joseph+martin%22+%22patrick+henry%22&ei=lrW5Sf_5Go-qkATYy937Cw#PPA374,M1]</ref>

"Partisans of the State in N[orth] Carolina afterwards found him obnoxious to their views," former Governor Henry wrote Virginia Senator [[William Grayson]] in urging Martin's reappointment in 1789, "and as I believe often endangered his Life For his duty called him to discourage their Disorderly conduct [and] thwart their favorite Schemes." Henry then commended Martin for his efforts to impose restraints upon the actions of the State of Franklin settlers, whose "frequent Butcherys of Indians & Refinement in cruelty sufficiently characterize these people who are Mr Martins decided Foes."<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=i5RADFeMCg8C&pg=PA202&dq=%22patrick+henry%22+%22joseph+martin%22&lr=&ei=7QTASduzMpvukQSQsKDwCw |title=The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. XIV-No. 1, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond, Virginia, 1906 |publisher=Google Books |date=May 1, 2009 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref>

Martin's attempts to restrain the [[State of Franklin]] settlers from a more-belligerent course made Martin unacceptable in some quarters, where he was seen as too 'soft' on the tribesmen. Martin also became controversial in some quarters are the [[Treaty of Hopewell]] in 1785, when Martin, [[Andrew Pickens (congressman)|Andrew Pickens]] and [[Benjamin Hawkins]], acting as government agents, concluded treaties with the Cherokees and the Choctaws. The Cherokee treaty particularly engendered later enmity from the Indian signatories, as well as the colonial state governments. The Indians saw the treaty as a thinly-veiled land grab, and the state governments saw the treaty as an attempt to encroach on local government authority, and attempts were made in [[United States Congress|Congress]] to void it. "No action of Martin's life brought down on him more condemnation than this [the Hopewell Treaty]," wrote historian Stephen B. Weeks of the incident.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gGOSEXzyo-oC&pg=PR10&lpg=PR10&dq=%22joseph+martin%22+%22thomas+jefferson%22&source=bl&ots=vPixDB826K&sig=Z7koXYwkWX5JWybeb7hqNVlHJJA&hl=en&ei=vsGzS7WjHJHYNaOEwJsJ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAUQ6AEwADhk#v=onepage&q=%22joseph%20martin%22%20&f=false |title=Joseph Martin, Stephen B.

Consequently, his appointment as agent was not renewed, despite Henry's repeated entreaties to political allies for Martin's reinstatement. (In a 1789 letter to Senator William Grayson, Henry reminded his political ally that Martin had been so effective in his Indian dealings during the Revolutionary War that British agents had offered rewards to their Indian allies for Martin's scalp.<ref name="books.google.com"/>)

But the forces allied against Martin overwhelmed Henry's defense, and in 1789, his career as Indian agent finished, General Martin sold his large holdings in the [[Powell River (Tennessee River)|Powell's Valley]] and near [[Cumberland Gap]] and returned to his lands in Henry County next door to Henry's<ref>"His wife and Family are my neighbours at Leatherwood & I can forward any letter to him," former Governor Henry wrote to [[United States Senator]] from Virginia [[William Grayson]] in 1789.[http://books.google.com/books?id=i5RADFeMCg8C&pg=PA202&dq=%22patrick+henry%22+%22joseph+martin%22&lr=&ei=7QTASduzMpvukQSQsKDwCw#PPA203,M1]</ref> to spend the rest of his life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~vahsswv/historicalsketches/martingenjoseph.html |title=General Joseph Martin, A Forgotten Pioneer, 1740<U+2013>1808, Gordon Aronhime, Southwest Virginia Historical Society, ancestry.com |publisher=Rootsweb.ancestry.com |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref> A year later, in 1790, when the  governorship of the [[Southwest Territory]] opened up, Patrick Henry suggested Gen.

==Legislative service==
In his peripatetic life on the frontier, Martin was called upon to serve in the legislatures of several states. He served as a member of the [[North Carolina]] Convention called to approve the [[United States Constitution]], and served several times in the [[North Carolina General Assembly]]. Martin was subsequently elected to the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], until he finally chose to retire because of advanced age.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DSUSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA278&dq=%27DANIEL+BOONE%22+%22JOSEPH+MARTIN%27&lr=&ei=7T27SaUdj8CVBM6HmdML#PPA749,M1 |title=History of Southwest Virginia, 1746<U+2013>1786, Washington County, 1777<U+2013>1870, Lewis Preston Summers, J.

Martin was also initially a member of the [[Watauga Association]], which supported the founding of the State of Franklin. Martin subsequently resigned his membership when he saw that it might compromise his role as Indian agent.

In 1799, Martin and his old friend Major John Redd of Henry County served as the two county representatives on the Virginia commission relating to the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cMPyo8TrY-IC&pg=PA235&lpg=PA235&dq=%22joseph+martin%22+%22thomas+jefferson%22&source=bl&ots=1oVQdcq2u4&sig=YZFu0ukQaLhlU-IKWeWBqKXexTg&hl=en&ei=yM6zS821OpWINv3woJEJ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CA0Q6AEwAjhu#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=The Virginia Report of 1799<U+2013>1800 Touching the Alien and Sedition Laws; Together with the Virginia Resolutions of December 21, 1799, Originally published by J.W.

==Family life, legacy and descendants==
Gen. Joseph Martin's first wife was Sarah Lucas. They were both born in Virginia and together had five children, including Revolutionary War officer, Col. William L. Martin, who eventually moved to Smith County, in Middle Tennessee. After Sarah Lucas Martin's death, Joseph Martin married Susannah Graves in Henry County, Virginia. They had 12 children, all of whom were born in Virginia, including: Col. Joseph Martin of Henry County, Va. He was one of five of Gen. Martin's sons who served in the [[War of 1812]]. Another Martin son, and veteran of the War of 1812, was Patrick Henry Martin. He was a young, trained lawyer, and died a bachelor on his trip home after the war. He was named in honor of Gen. Martin's friend and neighbor, Governor Patrick Henry. Gen. Martin's son, Capt. Lewis Graves Martin, also a veteran of the War of 1812, moved from Henry County, Virginia to Rutherford/Cannon County in Middle Tennessee, in 1816, where he married Belinda Rucker (daughter of Gideon Rucker, Sr. & Joyce Reade; both of whom were born in Va. and moved to Middle Tennessee). They had a large family before Belinda's death in the late 1830s. Capt. Lewis G. Martin remarried and removed to Missouri in 1840. Another Martin son, and veteran of the War of 1812, was Thomas Martin. He also moved to Middle Tennessee where he married Georgia Carr (daughter of Dabney Carr). Alexander Martin, another son and veteran of the War of 1812, also moved to Middle Tennessee. He married Elizabeth Carr (daughter of John Fyndall Carr, also a Tennessean from Virginia), and after some years, moved to Missouri. Another son of Gen. Martin and Susannah Graves was Esq. Judge John C. Martin, who also moved to Middle Tennessee in the days following the War of 1812, where he became a judge and chairman of the Cannon County courts, and served five terms as county executive. He was also responsible for the construction of the original Cannon County court house, erected in 1830. He married Sophia Rucker, sister to his brother Lewis' wife, Belinda. Other children of Gen. Martin include: Martha Martin Cleveland, Elizabeth Martin Waller (1768 - 1805), Brice Martin (1770 - 1856), Jesse Martin (1786 - 1836), Susan Martin King (1799 - ____)and others. Gen. Martin also had two children with his half-Cherokee [[common-law marriage|common law wife]] "frontier wife", Elizabeth Ward, daughter of frontiersman, Bryant Ward and his wife, "the beloved woman of the Cherokee," Nancy Ward. One of their children may have been Nancy Martin Hildebrand (1778 - 1837).

The Native Indian connection of two members of the Martin family has created some confusion for some Martin genealogy researchers; Gen. Joseph Martin's brother, Capt. John "Jack" Calvin Martin, Sr., of his N.C. Rock House Plantation, a.k.a. Rock Castle Plantation, is often confused with his brother Gen. Joseph Martin. Capt. John "Jack" Martin, Sr. moved from Virginia to N.C. with his brother William Martin, Sr.. In N.C. Capt. John "Jack" Martin, Sr. married a Miss Emory, who was half Native American. She died early in their marriage. Her widower, "Jack," then married her sister, a second Miss Emory. This same Capt. John "Jack" Martin, Sr. and his Emory wife were the parents of a John Calvin Martin, Jr. who served as a judge on the supreme court of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma, although he was only 1/4 Cherokee. This Oklahoma judge was the older cousin of the Tennessee judge of the same name; the son of Gen. Joseph Martin and wife Susannah Graves, as mentioned earlier; Esq. Judge, John C. Martin of Tennessee. There were two Martin cousins with the same name who both served as judges. Although they were born many miles and many years apart, their identities are sometimes confused by modern researchers looking at the names alone.

Another brother of Gen. Joseph Martin, William Martin, Sr., was the father of Gen. William "Buck" Martin, Jr., who served in the War of 1812 on Andrew Jackson's staff.

Gen. Martin, after helping adjudicate the western boundary line between [[North Carolina]], [[Kentucky]] and Virginia as far as the [[Cumberland Mountains]], retired to his plantation, ''Bellemont'' on Leatherwood Creek, which he purchased in 1796 from [[Benjamin Harrison V]] of [[Berkeley Plantation]], which was originally built by a Capt. John Martin who was possibly the great-uncle of General Joseph Martin. General Joseph Martin died at his Leatherwood plantation December 18, 1808, and was buried there in the family cemetery.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=99ERAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA113 dq=%22major+john+redd%22+%22joseph+martin%22&lr=&ei=U0J6SdnTBozSlQSYm9nXBg#PPA118,M1 |title=Reminiscences of Western Virginia, Major John Redd, The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. VII, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond, Va., 1899 |publisher=Google Books |date=May 1, 2009 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/genjosmartin/cemetery1.html&date=2009-10-25+22:34:52 The Martin Family Cemetery on Belmont(e) Plantation, geocities.com]</ref> Buried alongside him at the graveyard at ''Belmont'' are three other Joseph Martins: [[Colonel]] Joseph Martin, son of the general, and his son Joseph and grandson Joseph, who lived at ''Greenwood'' plantation.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=w3f7i_buckMC&pg=PA213&lpg=PA213&dq=%22joseph+martin%22+albemarle+county&source=bl&ots=R9KuWTlFV3&sig=-Z-ujkPnmEbndunZDIc4m26h55w&hl=en&ei=XnTVSsH5K5H6sQOx_8TaAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CCAQ6AEwBjge#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Tennessee Records: Tombstone Inscriptions and Manuscripts, Jeannette Tillotson Acklen, Reprinted by Heritage Books, 2007, ISBN 978-0-7884-2144-0 |publisher=Google Books |date=June 1, 1980 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref>[[File:Colonel William Martin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Col.

==Toby's freedom==
General Joseph Martin owned a [[slave]] named 'Toby' from the time Toby was about 25 years old, and in his letters to historian [[Lyman Draper]], Martin's son Col. William Martin told Draper that Toby, "a bright mulatto, a little under middle stature, of great physical powers, as well as mental" had served his father for many years and had distinguished himself in several battles. It was General Martin's intention, noted his son, that Toby be freed at Joseph Martin's death, but the General died [[intestate]]. But taking note of the General's affection for his longtime slave, as well as Martin's family's sentiments towards Martin's constant companion, the family elected "by mutual consent" to leave Toby out of the inventory of General Martin's estate, and Toby "has ever since been free, and has made himself a good estate."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vdQRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA443&lpg=PA443&dq=%22joseph+martin%22+tennessee+general+assembly&source=bl&ots=PVDvovvYQ9&sig=uZx4aJxTeYFMn9fC-X9MBuxH2O0&hl=en&ei=8n-8SfyWHZnMsAPMnY2eAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=2&ct=result#PPA446,M1 |title=Publications of the Southern History Association, Vol. IV, Published by the Association, Washington, D.
