'''Maryland Route 16''' (MD 16) is a two-lane north&ndash;south state highway in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maryland]], traversing [[Caroline County, Maryland|Caroline County]] and [[Dorchester County, Maryland|Dorchester County]].  It travels for {{convert|51.06|mi|km|2}} across the two counties.

==Route description==

===Dorchester County===
MD 16 begins at its end of state maintenance along Taylors Island Road on [[Taylors Island, Maryland|Taylors Island]], at the intersection with Hoopers' Neck Road.  It begins a two-lane road, usually with shoulders.  Shortly after it begins, it passes over a bridge for Slaughter Creek and begins to curve to the north.  It passes by [[Church Creek, Maryland|Church Creek]], where its name changes to Church Creek Road upon meeting the north end of [[Maryland Route 335]].  Church Creek Road continues east, continuing into the [[Cambridge, Maryland|Cambridge]] city limits and intersecting [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|U.S. Route 50]].  At US 50, MD 16 turns east onto the four-lane highway, which carries the names of Sunburst Highway inside the city and the Ocean Gateway outside, until the intersection with Mount Holly Road.  MD 16 turns north on this road, intersecting [[Maryland Route 14]] along the way.

As it approaches [[East New Market, Maryland|East New Market]], MD 16 leaves the carriageway, which changes to [[Maryland Route 392]] as the East New Market Bypass.  MD 16 turns northeast, passing through town as its Main Street.  While inside town, it intersects MD 14 again, and shortly after exiting town, the road's name changes to East New Market Ellwood Road.  It travels a distance further, passing over Cabin Creek some time before intersecting and running concurrent with [[Maryland Route 331]].  The two routes continue northward, and shortly after the roadway intersects the north end of [[Maryland Route 318]], the road passes into Caroline County.

===Caroline County===
Shortly after entering Caroline County, it passes into [[Preston, Maryland|Preston]] and becomes the town's Main Street, before MD 16 leaves the concurrency at Harmony Road, traveling north.  It passes into [[harmony, Maryland|Harmony]] and intersects [[Maryland Route 578]], Bethlehem Road, turning northwest at the intersection. As it passes to the east of [[Williston, Maryland|Williston]], it bridges Lake Williston shortly after passing by the unnamed and unsigned [[Maryland Route 617]].  MD 16 continues on the same basic trajectory until it intersects [[Maryland Route 404]] and [[Maryland Route 313]], south of [[Denton, Maryland|Denton]].

[[File:MD 16-MD 313-MD 404 shields.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Shields for MD 16, [[Maryland Route 313|MD 313]], and [[Maryland Route 404|MD 404]] along a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]].]]
MD 16, MD 313, and MD 404 overlap, now known as Shore Highway, with the three-route concurrency traveling east toward the Delaware state line.  MD 313 leaves Shore Highway south on Federalsburg Highway, and at the next intersection, MD 16 leaves the road as well, traveling slightly more northerly on Greenwood Road.  MD 16 then travels a few more miles before it enters [[Delaware]].  As the road passes across the state line, it retains its number as [[Delaware Route 16]], and its name changes to Hickman Road.<ref name="Google Maps MD 16"/>

==Points of interest==
Sites of note that the road serves include the [[Linchester Mill]] (circa 1682), a veteran's cemetery in [[Beulah, Maryland|Beulah]], the home of [[Revolutionary War]] hero [[William Richardson (soldier)|William Richardson]], and the ancestral farm of [[Charles Dickinson (historical figure)|Charles Dickinson]], infamous for his duel with [[Andrew Jackson]].

==History==
The portion of MD 16 between Church Creek and East New Market via Cambridge was chosen as one of the original state roads by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909.<ref name="1930 src report"/>  The portion of the highway between Bureau and the western junction with MD 313 and MD 404 south of Denton was also included in the planned state road system; that piece of highway was the first part of modern MD 16 completed in 1910.<ref name="1930 src report"/><ref name="1915 src report"/>  MD 16 was completed from Mount Holly to East New Market in 1911, from Cambridge to Mount Holly in 1913, from East New Market to Preston via Linchester in 1914, and from Church Creek to Cambridge in 1915.  The gap in the state highway within East New Market was closed in 1917.<ref name="1919 src report"/>

The next portions of MD 16 constructed were between Taylor's Island and Church Creek and between Preston and Bureau.  The segment of highway between Preston and Grove was surfaced by 1915.<ref name="1915 src report"/>  MD 16 between Grove and Bureau was under construction by 1919 and finished around 1920.  The state highway was constructed from the bridge to Taylor's Island to Church Creek between 1917 and 1919.<ref name="1919 src report"/>  The portion of MD 16 between MD 404 in Andersontown and the Delaware state line was completed between 1930 and 1933, concurrent with the connecting section of MD 404.<ref name="1930 src report"/><ref name="1933 map"/>

When numbers were assigned to state highways in Maryland in 1927, MD 16 had a concurrency with US 213 between Waddell's Corner and Preston.<ref name="1927 map"/>  MD 16 was extended north and east through Andersontown by 1939, giving the state highway additional concurrencies with MD 313 and MD 404.  Also in 1939, US 213 between Easton and Vienna was transferred to a new route via Cambridge; the old portion of US 213 was redesignated MD 331 and the new section of US 213 became concurrent with MD 16 between Cambridge and Mount Holly.<ref name="1939 map"/>  Within Cambridge, MD 16 followed Race Street north to Washington Street, which the highway followed east toward Mount Holly.<ref name="1940 map"/>

The next changes in MD 16 occurred in the 1950s.  MD 16 was extended west across Slaughter Creek to Taylors Island when a new bridge was completed in 1950.<ref name="1950 map"/>  MD 313 was moved to its present alignment between Federalsburg and Denton in 1954, thus forming the only triple concurrency in Maryland.<ref name="1954 map"/>  US 50, which had replaced US 213 in 1949, was expanded to a divided highway along its concurrency with MD 16 by 1955.<ref name="1949 map"/><ref name="1955 map"/><ref name="1954 src report"/>  Finally, MD 16 was relocated to bypass Cambridge in the late 1960s.  MD 16's old route through the city was transferred to newly designated MD 341 and an extension of MD 343 east to US 50.<ref name="1970 map"/>
