=== KJNB ===

The official student radio station of CSB/SJU allows students to host talk and music-oriented shows in one-hour segments. When KJNB first started out in 1954, it was located in the basement of Mary Hall. In 2001, the studio was moved to its current location in the lower level of Guild Hall in the center of campus. Broadcasts are streamed via http://kjnbradio.webs.com/, on closed-circuit campus TV Channel 6, and can be accessed on the radio anywhere in Collegeville on 99.5. KJNB does not advertise, and dead air is filled with randomly cycled music. KJNB is currently being renovated.

=== Channel Eight ===

Channel Eight is the local television station for CSB/SJU. Project Eight launched during the 2011<U+2013>2012 school year, the channel has begun featuring student produced television shows along with other campus related activities such as live broadcasts of Senate meetings.
