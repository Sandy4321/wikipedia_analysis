'''Petar Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107>''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: <U+041F><U+0435><U+0442><U+0430><U+0440> <U+0411><U+0430><U+045B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+045B>; 1898 <U+2013> April 1945) was a [[Bosnian Serb]] reserve officer, lawyer, and [[Chetnik]] commander of eastern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]] within occupied [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] during the [[Second World War]]. Beginning in the summer of 1941 until April 1942, he headed the Cabinet of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs]] for [[Milan Nedi<U+0107>]]'s puppet [[Government of National Salvation]] in [[Belgrade]]. In July 1942, Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> was appointed by Chetnik movement leader [[Dra<U+017E>a Mihailovi<U+0107>]] and his Supreme Command as the commander of the "Chetnik Operational Units in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina" during which Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborated]] with the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Italians]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] in actions against the [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. He and other Chetnik commanders carried out numerous massacres against the [[Bosniak|Bosnian Muslim]] and [[Croats|Catholic]] civilian population and those sympathetic to the Partisan movement. He was captured and killed in April 1945 near [[Banja Luka]] along with Chetnik leaders [[Pavle <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>]] and [[Zaharije Ostoji<U+0107>]], and Chetnik ideologue [[Dragi<U+0161>a Vasi<U+0107>]] by elements of the [[Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia]] (HOS) after an apparent trap was set.

==Early life==
Petar Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> was born in 1898 in [[Kalinovik]], a village of the [[Bosnia Vilayet]], a province of the [[Ottoman Empire]] that was [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|occupied]] by the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] in 1878. His father Maksim was a [[Chetniks|Chetnik]]  commander ({{lang-sh|vojvoda, <U+0432>o<U+0458><U+0432><U+043E><U+0434><U+0430>}}). Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> was a [[major]] in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]'s [[Military reserve force|reserves]]. He studied law, dealt with legal work, and was a governor's notary prior to the outbreak of the [[Second World War]].{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=17}}

==World War II==
===Ministry of Internal Affairs and Chetnik appointment===
Beginning in the summer of 1941 until April 1942, he headed the Cabinet of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs]] for [[Milan Nedi<U+0107>]]'s puppet [[Government of National Salvation]] in [[Belgrade]]. In April 1942, after an agreement between Chetnik movement leader [[Dra<U+017E>a Mihailovi<U+0107>]] and Nedi<U+0107>, he left with a Chetnik detachment to the eastern Bosnia part of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH).{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=17}} In April and May 1942, Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> along with [[Pavle <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>]] and [[Rade Korda]] took part in the German-launched "[[Third Enemy Offensive]]" against the Partisans.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=166}}

On 13 July 1942, Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> was appointed by Mihailovi<U+0107>{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=101}} and his Supreme Command as [[Bo<U+0161>ko Todorovi<U+0107>]]'s successor as the commander of the "Chetnik Operational Units in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina" at a conference held at [[Zimonji<U+0107> Kula]],{{sfn|Hoare|2006|pp=160, 303}} at which Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> openly announced his plans to destroy entire Muslim villages.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=101}}

===Italian contact and extermination efforts===
In the summer of 1942, when order had been established in significant parts of the Italian occupation zone, Chetnik detachment leaders including [[Petar Samard<U+017E>i<U+0107>]], [[Mom<U+010D>ilo <U+0110>uji<U+0107>]], [[Uro<U+0161> Drenovi<U+0107>]], [[Dobroslav Jev<U+0111>evi<U+0107>]], [[Ilija Trifunovi<U+0107>-Bir<U+010D>anin]], and their principal political spokesmen with [[Italian Second Army]] headquarters were recognized as [[auxiliaries]] by the Italians and early in the summer Italian commander [[Mario Roatta]] allowed for the delivery of arms, munitions, and supplies to the Chetniks. By July 1942, Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107>, acting as one of Jev<U+0111>evi<U+0107>'s military organizers, informed Mihailovi<U+0107> that the vast majority of the 7,000 Chetniks in Herzegovina were well-equipped with [[small arms|light weapons]] and had been "legalized" by the Italians. Combined with <U+0110>uji<U+0107>'s group, the Chetnik detachments legalized in the Italian zone stood at 10,000 or more troops.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=77}}

On 6 August 1942, in a continued Chetnik effort to purge their ranks and outsiders of those they thought could interfere with their work, Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> ordered subordinate commanders of all corps and brigades to submit lists and data on such individuals with suggestions on how to deal with them. Brigade commanders were required to send three assassins to kill any person who they labelled with the letter "Z" within 24 hours of receiving the name. Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> demanded that "the killing has to be done exclusively through the use of slaughtering knife".{{sfn|Dizdar|Sobolevski|1999|p=128}} In the same month, Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107>'s Chetniks carried out massacres in [[Fo<U+010D>a]] and in the villages of [[Bukovica]], killing about 1,000 Muslims, including about 300 women, children, and  elderly. In the field near [[Ustikolina]] and [[Jahorina]] in eastern Bosnia, Chetniks of Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> and [[Zaharije Ostoji<U+0107>]] massacred some 2,500 Muslims and burned villages. Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> also killed a number of sympathizers of the Partisans elsewhere.{{sfn|Dizdar|Sobolevski|1999|p=685}}{{sfn|Dedijer|Mileti<U+0107>|1990|p=581}}

In September 1942, Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> completed a tour of Chetnik units in Herzegovina and reported that the morale of the population was excellent, and that the actions of the Usta<U+0161>e and Partisans was drawing the populace to the Chetnik movement. He also reported that following the recent capture of Fo<U+010D>a from the Usta<U+0161>e, his men had killed 1,200 Usta<U+0161>e in uniform and about 1,000 "compromised Muslims" at a cost of only four Chetniks killed and five wounded.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=300}} In the Croatian town of [[Makarska]], his Chetniks killed 900 Croats.{{sfn|Dizdar|Sobolevski|1999|p=685}} His reports made it evident that his forces were partaking in a systematic effort to exterminate the Muslim and Catholic population of Herzegovina. One of these reports stated that during reprisal attacks against the towns of [[Ljubu<U+0161>ki]] and [[Imotski]] his Chetniks had skinned alive three Catholic priests, killed all men aged fifteen years or above, and burned 17 villages, with the express purpose of removing all Muslims from Herzegovina.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=300}}

===Operation Alfa===
In October 1942, Trifunovi<U+0107>-Bir<U+010D>anin arranged with Roatta for Chetniks under the command of Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> and Jev<U+0111>evi<U+0107> to take part in [[Operation Alfa]] with the Italians against the Partisans in [[Prozor-Rama|Prozor]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=233}} While in progress the Chetniks, acting on their own, burned villages and massacred between 500 and 2,500 Muslims and Catholics in the Prozor area.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=232<U+2013>233}}{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=100}}{{sfn|Goldstein|7 November 2012}}{{sfn|Dedijer|Mileti<U+0107>|1990|p=581}} Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> reported to Mihailovi<U+0107> that over 2,000 had been killed.{{sfn|Red<U+017E>i<U+0107>|2005|p=141}} Roatta objected to these "massive slaughters" of noncombatant civilians and threatened to halt Italian aid to the Chetniks if they did not end.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=146}}

In the same month, Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107>'s Chetniks, together with the Italians, killed 100 Croats sympathetic to the Partisan movement in the [[Dalmatia]]n villages of [[Gata, Croatia|Gata]], [[Niklica]] and [[<U+010C>islo]].{{sfn|Dedijer|Mileti<U+0107>|1990|p=581}} Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> issued an appeal to Partisan Serbs which blamed the establishment of the Partisan movement on [[Jews]] and "the scum of the earth". He blamed the Partisans for the destruction of traditional Serb society, religion and morals, claiming that they were corrupting women and the young, and promoting incest and immorality.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=160}} He further deplored to Serb Partisans that they were being led by "Jews, Muslims, Croats, Magyars, Bulgarians".{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=160}} He claimed that the Serb Chetniks controlled all of Serbia, [[Kingdom of Montenegro (1941-1944)|Montenegro]], the [[Sand<U+017E>ak]], Herzegovina and most of Bosnia, and that his "duped brothers" the Serb Partisans were to be found only in a few places in Bosnia. He urged them to defect to the Chetniks so that they could return to being "good Serbs" and contribute to the creation of a "free and Great Serb state".{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=300}}

===Relocation to northern Dalmatia and Lika===
[[File:Pavle <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> 13 February 1943 Muslim massacre report.jpg|thumb|<U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>'s report of 13 February 1943 informing Mihailovi<U+0107> of the massacres of Muslims in the districts of [[<U+010C>ajni<U+010D>e]] and [[Fo<U+010D>a]] in southeastern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and in the district of [[Pljevlja]] in the Sand<U+017E>ak in which Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107>'s Chetniks played a part.]]
In November and December 1942, the Italians helped about 4,000 of Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107>'s Chetniks in Herzegovina relocate to northern Dalmatia and [[Lika]] with another 4,000 to be relocated later.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=260}}

In February 1943, Chetniks under the command of Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107>, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>, Ostoji<U+0107>, and [[Vuk Kalaitovi<U+0107>]] massacred 9,200 Muslims, including approximately 1,200 Muslim men and about 8,000 women, children, and the elderly in the [[Pljevlja]] district in Sand<U+017E>ak, and [[<U+010C>ajni<U+010D>e]] and Fo<U+010D>a districts in Bosnia. They looted and burned down about 2,000 houses in the process.{{sfn|Dedijer|Mileti<U+0107>|1990|p=591}}

On 10 February 1943, a proclamation signed by Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107>, <U+0110>uji<U+0107>, [[Ilija Mihi<U+0107>]], and [[Radovan Ivani<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]], the Chetnik commanders of east [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], [[Herzegovina]], Dalmatia, and Lika, was issued. It declared to the people of those regions that the Chetniks had cleansed Serbia, Montenegro, and Herzegovina of the Partisans, and were about to do the same in their areas. The declaration denounced the Partisans as "criminals" and "paid Jews".{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=162}} The declaration called upon the Partisan [[rank and file]] to kill their political commissars and join the Chetniks, and claimed that hundreds of their comrades were surrendering to the Chetniks every day because they realised that they had been "betrayed and swindled by the Communist Jews".{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=162}}

On 28 February 1943, 2,807 of the 8,137 Chetniks operating in northern Dalmatia as part of the Italian [[Anti-Communist Volunteer Militia]] (MVAC) XVIIth Corps were under the command of Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107>.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=217}}

===Cairo and return===
In mid-February 1944, he left with British [[Special Operations Executive]] [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel]] [[Bill Bailey (officer)|S.W. "Bill" Bailey]] for [[Cairo]], where he was arrested and briefly detained in a British prison. Upon returning in late May he helped organize a Chetnik "Independent Group of National Resistance" and wanted to contact British forces who they expected to land in the southern [[Adriatic]] coast.{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=17}}

On 11 September 1944, Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> and Ostoji<U+0107> warned Chetnik headquarters that Muslims and Croats were joining the Partisans in large numbers and that Chetniks in Bosnia and Herzegovina lacked food and ammunition; they suggested Mihailovi<U+0107> request Allied occupation of Yugoslavia or suffer losing the war both politically and militarily. They assessed that the population had sensed that the Partisans were now supported by the three [[Allies of World War II|major Allied Powers]], but that the Chetniks had now been abandoned by them. On 20 October 1944, the Partisan and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] troops took Belgrade from the Germans. Soon after the Chetniks lost Serbia, the center of their movement.{{sfn|Red<U+017E>i<U+0107>|2005|pp=154<U+2013>155}} After the breakdown of the Chetnik movement in early 1945, Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> was no longer loyal to Mihailovi<U+0107>.{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=17}}

===Withdrawal and destruction===

Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> joined <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>'s forces in their trek towards [[Ljubljana Gap|Slovenia]], alongside Chetnik ideologue Dragi<U+0161>a Vasi<U+0107>, detachments commanded by Ostoji<U+0107>, and a large number of refugees,{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=447<U+2013>448}} totaling around 10,000.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=181}} This force was formed into the Chetnik 8th Montenegrin Army, consisting of the 1st, 5th, 8th and 9th (Herzegovina) divisions.{{sfn|Thomas|Mikulan|1995|p=23}} Earlier <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> and Mihailovi<U+0107> had argued over the best course of action. <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> had wanted to withdraw through Albania to Greece, but Mihailovi<U+0107> had told him to prepare for an Allied landing, the return of the king and the establishment of a national government.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=241}} From the time <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> joined Mihailovi<U+0107> in northeastern Bosnia, he was very critical of Mihailovi<U+0107>'s leadership and argued strongly for all remaining Chetnik troops to move to Slovenia. When Mihailovi<U+0107> remained unconvinced, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> decided to move to Slovenia independently of Mihailovi<U+0107>, and arranged for [[Dimitrije Ljoti<U+0107>]]'s [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] already in Slovenia to meet him near [[Biha<U+0107>]] in western Bosnia to assist his movement.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=447<U+2013>448}}

In order to get to Biha<U+0107>, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> made a safe-conduct agreement with elements of the [[Croatian Armed Forces (Independent State of Croatia)|Armed Forces of the NDH]] and with the Montenegrin separatist [[Sekula Drljevi<U+0107>]]. The details of the agreement are not known, but it appears that he and his troops were meant to cross the [[Sava]] river into [[Slavonia]] where they would be aligned with Drljevi<U+0107> as the "Montenegrin National Army" with <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> retaining operational command. <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> apparently tried to outsmart them and sent only his sick and wounded across the river, keeping his fit troops south of the river. He began moving his command westwards and, harassed by both the NDH troops and Partisans, reached the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] river. In the [[Battle of Lijev<U+010D>e Field]], north of [[Banja Luka]], the combined Chetnik force was defeated by a strong NDH force which was armed with German-supplied tanks.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=446<U+2013>448}}

Following this defeat and the defection of one of his sub-units to Drljevi<U+0107>, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> was induced to negotiate directly with the leaders of the NDH forces about the further movement of his Chetniks towards Slovenia. However, this appears to have been a trap, as he was attacked and captured by them on his way to the meeting. Exactly what occurred after his capture is not clear, but Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107>, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>, Vasi<U+0107>, Ostoji<U+0107> and  were subsequently killed, along with some Serbian Orthodox priests and others.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=447<U+2013>448}}

Both the NDH forces and Drljevi<U+0107> had reasons for ensnaring <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>. The NDH forces were motivated by the mass terror committed by <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> on the Muslim population in Sand<U+017E>ak and southeastern Bosnia while Drljevi<U+0107> was opposed to <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>'s support of a union of Serbia and Montenegro which ran counter to Drljevi<U+0107>'s separatism.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=447<U+2013>448}}
