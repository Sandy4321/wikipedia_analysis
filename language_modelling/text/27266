'''Ann C. Noble''' is a [[Sensory analysis|sensory]] [[chemist]] and retired professor from the [[University of California, Davis]]. During her time at the [[UC Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology]], Noble invented the "Aroma Wheel" which is credited with enhancing the public understanding of [[wine tasting]] and [[List of wine tasting descriptors|terminology]].<ref name="Oxford pg 35-36"> J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition pg 35-36 Oxford University Press 2006 ISBN 0198609906 </ref> At the time of her hiring at UC-Davis in 1974, Noble was the first woman hired as a faculty member of the Viticulture department.<ref name="Alley">L. Alley ''"[http://www.winespectator.com/Wine/Daily/News/0,1145,1804,00.html Wine Sensory Scientist Ann Noble Retires From UC Davis]"'' Wine Spectator August 21st, 2002 </ref> Noble retired from Davis in 2002 and in 2003 was named [[Emeritus]] Professor of [[Enology]]. Since retirement she has participated as a judge in the [[San Francisco Chronicle]] [[Wine Competition]].<ref name="San Fran"> San Francisco Chronicle ''"[http://www.winejudging.com/bios/ann_noble.htm Ann Noble bio]"'' Wine Judge: Accessed Dec. 16th, 2007 </ref>

==Career==
After earning her [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Food science]] from the [[University of Massachusetts]], Noble was hired by UC Davis in 1974 to work in their sensory research program.<ref name="Alley"/> After studying the techniques and application of [[wine]] tasting, Noble discovered that there was no objective framework or widely agreed upon terminology that a wine taster could use to describe things such as "earthy" [[aroma (wine)|aroma]]s or the different smells of various [[fruit]]s that can show up in a wine. In 1984, her research lead her to develop the "Aroma Wheel".<ref name="Oxford pg 35-36"/> Other research work went into how a wine's aroma and flavor can influence [[consumer]] choices as well as how wine tasters perceive of [[astringency]] in wine.<ref name="Alley"/>

===The Aroma Wheel===
[[Image:Fruity section of Aroma Wheel copyright A C Noble 1990 2002 wwwwinearomwheelcom.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A section of the Aroma Wheel invented by Ann C. Noble detailing the fruity aromas that are most commonly encountered in table wines. ''Used with permission from Ann Noble.'']]
The Aroma Wheel provides a visual graphic of the different categories and aroma components that one can encounter in wine. The terminology used is standardized for use by both professionals and amateur wine tasters. The aroma wheel does not contain terms to describe texture or [[mouthfeel]], however these are listed in the Australian "Mouthfeel Wheel". A separate Aroma Wheel has also been created for [[sparkling wine]]. The wheel breaks down wine aromas into 12 basic categories and then further sub-divided into different aromas that can fall into those main categories.<ref name="Oxford pg 35-36"/>
*[[Chemical]] &ndash; Includes aromas like [[sulfur]] and [[petroleum]]
*[[Pungent]] &ndash; Aromas like [[alcohol]]
*[[Oxidized]] &ndash; Aromas like [[acetaldehyde]]
*[[Microbiological]] &ndash; Aromas like [[yeast]] and [[lactic acid]]
*[[Floral]] &ndash; Aromas like ''[[Pelargonium]]'' geraniums and [[linalool]]
*[[Spicy]] &ndash; Aromas like [[licorice]] and [[anise]]
*[[Fruity]] &ndash; Aromas like [[blackcurrant]] and [[apricot]]
*[[Vegetation|Vegetative]] &ndash; Aromas like [[eucalyptus]] and [[artichoke]]
*[[Nut (fruit)|Nutty]] &ndash; Aromas like [[walnut]] and [[hazelnut]]
*[[Caramelized]] &ndash; Aromas like [[butterscotch]] and [[molasses]]
*[[Wood]]y &ndash; Aromas often imparted by [[oak (wine)|oak]] like [[vanilla]] and [[coffee]]
*[[Earthy]] &ndash; Aromas such as [[mushroom]] and [[mildew]]

The [[German Wine Institute]] has created a special [[German language]] version of the Aroma Wheel meant to be specially adapted to [[German wine]]s, with one wheel for white wines and one wheel for red wines.<ref>[http://www.deutscheweine.de/internet-de/nav/74c/74c492b8-e441-6117-3d28-952196117f51$08b709dd-d602-3401-be59-267b48205846.htm Deutscheweine.de: Das Wein-Aromarad]</ref> However, in the translation they removed the petroleum smell (and the entire "chemical" category) from the white wine wheel, despite the fact that mature [[Riesling]] wines - Germany's signature grape variety - are the best-known examples of wines that show this aroma. It seems that the motive for omitting the reference to petroleum was that many consumers perceive it as a "negative" aroma. The Institute's move has been criticized by foreign experts on German wines.<ref name="O.
