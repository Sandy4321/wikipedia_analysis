'''Egginton railway station''' was a former [[Train station|railway station]] in [[Egginton]], [[Derbyshire]].

It was opened by the [[North Staffordshire Railway]]. However it closed in 1878 when the  [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)]] opened its [[GNR Derbyshire and Staffordshire Extension|Derbyshire Extension]] and a joint station was built at [[Egginton Junction railway station|Egginton Junction]].

The buildings next to the Etwall Road level crossing, however, have survived and are still occupied.
