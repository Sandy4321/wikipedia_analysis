'''Malagasy cuisine''' encompasses the many diverse culinary traditions of the [[Indian Ocean]] island of [[Madagascar]], each reflecting various degrees of influence from the Southeast Asian, African, Indian, Chinese and [[Europe]]an migrants that have settled on the island since it was first populated by seafarers from [[Borneo]] between 100 CE and 500 CE. [[Rice]], the cornerstone of the [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] diet, was cultivated alongside [[tuber]]s and other Southeast Asian staples by these earliest settlers. Their diet was supplemented by scavenging and hunting wild game which contributed to the extinction of the island's [[megafauna]]. These food sources were later complemented by beef in the form of [[zebu]] introduced into Madagascar by East African migrants arriving around 1,000&nbsp;CE. Trade with [[Arab people|Arab]] and [[Indian people|Indian]] merchants and European transatlantic traders further enriched the island's culinary traditions by introducing a wealth of new fruits, vegetables and seasonings that were combined to produce the cuisine of Madagascar.

Throughout almost the entire island, the contemporary cuisine of Madagascar consists of a base of rice ({{lang-mg|vary}}, pronounced {{IPA-mg|<U+02C8>var<U+02B2>|}}), typically with an accompaniment termed ''laoka'' ({{IPA-mg|<U+02C8>lok<U+0259><U+0325>|}}) in the official dialect of the [[Malagasy language]]. The many varieties of laoka may be [[vegetarian cuisine|vegetarian]] or include animal proteins, and typically feature a sauce flavored with such ingredients as ginger, onion, garlic, tomato, [[vanilla]], salt, [[curry powder]] or&mdash;less commonly&mdash;other spices or herbs. In parts of the arid south and west, [[pastoralism|pastoral]] families may replace rice with maize, cassava and [[curd]]s made from fermented zebu milk. A wide variety of sweet and savory [[fritter]]s as well as other street foods are available across the island, as are diverse tropical and temperate-climate fruits. Locally produced beverages include fruit juices, coffee, herbal and black teas, and alcoholic drinks such as rum, wine and beer.

The range of dishes eaten in Madagascar in the 21st century offers insight into the island's unique history and the diversity of the peoples who inhabit it today. The complexity of Malagasy meals can range from the simple, traditional preparations introduced by the earliest settlers, to the refined festival dishes prepared for the island's [[Merina Kingdom|19th-century monarchs]]. Although the classic Malagasy meal of rice and its accompaniment remains predominant, over the past 100 years the other food types and combinations have been popularized by [[French people in Madagascar|French colonists]] and immigrants from [[Chinese people in Madagascar|China]] and [[Indians in Madagascar|India]]. Consequently, Malagasy cuisine is traditional while also assimilating newly emergent cultural influences.

They also gathered honey, fruits, bird and crocodile eggs, mushrooms, [[List of edible seeds|edible seeds]] and [[List of root vegetables|roots]], and brewed alcoholic beverages from honey and sugar cane juice.<ref name=autogenerated1>Sibree (1896), p. 333</ref>

[[Game (food)|Game]] was regularly hunted and trapped in the forests, including frogs, snakes, lizards, hedgehogs and [[tenrec]]s, tortoises, wild boars, insects, [[larva]]e, birds and [[lemur]]s.<ref name = "Stiles">{{Cite journal |last=Stiles |first=D. |title=Tubers and Tenrecs: the Mikea of Southwestern Madagascar |journal=Ethnology |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=251&ndash;263 |year=1991}}</ref>  The first settlers encountered Madagascar's wealth of megafauna, including [[Subfossil lemur|giant lemurs]], [[elephant bird]]s, [[giant fossa]] and the [[Malagasy hippopotamus]].

As more virgin forest was lost to tavy, communities increasingly planted and cultivated permanent plots of land.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Olson |first=S. |title=The robe of the ancestors: Forests in the history of Madagascar |journal=Journal of Forest History |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=174&ndash;186 |year=1984}}</ref> By 600&nbsp;CE, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and begun clearing the forests of the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|central highlands]]. Rice was originally dry planted or cultivated in marshy lowland areas, which produced low yields. [[Paddy field|Irrigated rice paddies]] were adopted in the highlands around 1600, first in [[Betsileo]] country in the southern highlands, then later in the northern highlands of [[Imerina]].<ref name=autogenerated4>Campbell (1993), p. 116</ref> By the time terraced paddies emerged in central Madagascar over the next century,<ref name=autogenerated4 /> the area's original forest cover had largely vanished.

Zebu, a form of humped cattle, were introduced to the island around 1000&nbsp;CE by settlers from east Africa, who also brought [[sorghum]], goats, possibly [[Bambara groundnut]], and other food sources. Because these cattle represented a form of wealth in east African and consequently Malagasy culture, they were eaten only rarely, typically after their ritual sacrifice at events of spiritual import such as funerals.<ref name = Gade105/> Fresh zebu milk and curds instead constituted a major part of the pastoralists' diet.<ref>Linton (1928), p. 386</ref> Zebu were kept in large herds in the south and west, but as individual herd members escaped and reproduced, a sizable population of wild zebu established itself in the highlands. [[Merina]] oral history tells that highland people were unaware that zebu were edible prior to the reign of King [[Ralambo]] (ruled 1575&ndash;1612), who is credited with the discovery, although archaeological evidence suggests that zebu were occasionally hunted and consumed in the highlands prior to Ralambo's time. It is more likely that these wild herds were first domesticated and kept in pens during this period, which corresponds with the emergence of complex, structured [[polity|polities]] in the highlands.<ref name=Gade105/>
[[File:Fish drying in the sun poisson seche Madagascar.jpg|thumb|225px|left|alt = rows of fish hang from string, drying in the sun |Fish are preserved through such traditional methods as drying, smoking and salting.<ref name = smoke/>]]
Foods were commonly prepared by boiling in water (at first using green bamboo as a vessel, and later clay or iron pots),<ref>Linton (1928), p. 367</ref> roasting over a fire or grilling over hot stones or coals.<ref name = "Stiles"/> [[Fermentation (food)|Fermentation]] was also used to create curds from milk, develop the flavor of certain dried or fresh tubers or produce alcoholic beverages from honey, sugar cane juice or other local plants.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The techniques of sun curing ([[drying (food)|drying]]), [[smoking (food)|smoking]] and [[salting (food)|salting]] were used to preserve various foods for transport, trade or future consumption. Many foods prepared in these ways, such as a smoked dried beef called ''kitoza'' ({{IPA-mg|ki<U+02C8>tuz<U+0259><U+0325>|}}) and salted dried fish, are still eaten in a similar form in modern-day Madagascar.<ref name = smoke>Grandidier (1899), p. 521</ref>

By the 16th&nbsp;century, centralized kingdoms had emerged on the west coast among the [[Sakalava]] and in the Central highlands among the Merina. The [[List of Malagasy monarchs|Merina sovereigns]] celebrated the new year with an ancient Merina ceremony called the Royal Bath (''[[Ralambo#Fandroana|fandroana]]''). For this ceremony, a beef [[confit]] called ''jaka'' ({{IPA-mg|<U+02C8>dzak<U+0259><U+0325>|}}) was prepared by placing beef in a decorative clay jar and sealing it with [[suet]], then conserving it in an underground pit for a year. The jaka would be shared with friends at the following year's festival. As a dessert, revelers would eat rice boiled in milk and drizzled with honey, a preparation known as ''tatao'' ({{IPA-mg|ta<U+02C8>tau<U+032F>|}}).

The advent of the [[Atlantic slave trade|trans-Atlantic slave trade]] increased maritime trade at Malagasy ports, including food products. In 1698, a trading vessel en route to the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] stopped first at Madagascar, where it obtained a stock of local Malagasy rice. The ship took the rice to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where this Malagasy grain&mdash;one of 11&nbsp;varieties of rice reportedly grown on the island by the late 18th&nbsp;century&mdash;soon became the chief export crop of the [[Southern United States|American South]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Oliver |first=Samuel |title=Madagascar: An historical and descriptive account of the island and its former dependencies.

The [[Opuntia|prickly pear cactus]] or ''raketa'' ({{IPA-mg|ra<U+02C8>ket<U+0259><U+0325>|}}), also known in southern Madagascar as ''sakafon-drano'' ({{IPA-mg|sa<U+02C8>kafu<U+02C8><U+0273><U+0256><U+02B3>an<U+02B7>|}}) or "water food", was brought from the [[New World]] to the French settlement at [[T<U+00F4>lanaro|Fort Dauphin]] in 1769 by Frenchman Count Dolisie de Maudave. The plant spread throughout the southern part of the island, where it became a fundamental food crop for [[Mahafaly]] and [[Bara people|Bara]] pastoralists. Consuming six or so of the fruits of this plant preempted the need to drink water, and once the spines had been removed, the [[Cladophyll|cladodes]] of the plant would nourish and hydrate the zebu cattle they tended. The introduction of this plant enabled the southern pastoralists to become more sedentary and efficient herders, thus boosting population density and cattle count in the region.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Kaufmann |first=J.C. |title=Forget the Numbers: The Case of a Madagascar Famine |journal=History in Africa |volume=27 |pages=143&ndash;157 |year=2000}}</ref>

The 18th&nbsp;century in the central highlands was characterized by increasing population density and consequent [[famine]]s, aggravated by warring among the principalities of Imerina. At the turn of the 19th century, King [[Andrianampoinimerina]] (1787&ndash;1810) successfully united these fractious Merina groups under his rule, then used [[slavery|slaves]] and [[unfree labor|forced labor]]&mdash;exacted in lieu of taxes for those without means to offer material payment&mdash;to systematically work the irrigated rice fields around [[Antananarivo]]. In this way, he ensured regular grain surpluses that were sufficient to consistently feed the entire population and export products for trade with other regions of the island. Marketplaces were established across the island to serve as central trading points for designated commodities such as smoked and dried seafood and meats, dried maize, salt, dried cassava and various fruits.<ref>Campbell (1993), p. 125</ref> Rice cakes, including ''mofo gasy'' ({{IPA-mg|<U+02C8>muf<U+02B7><U+02C8>gas<U+02B2>|}}) and ''menakely'' ({{IPA-mg|men<U+0259><U+0325><U+02C8>kel<U+02B2>|}}), were also sold by market vendors.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sibree |first=James |title=The Antananarivo annual and Madagascar magazine.

Under the Kingdom of Madagascar, [[plantation]]s were established for the production of crops exported to foreign markets such as England and France. Cloves were imported and planted in 1803, and coconuts&mdash;which had been relatively sparse on the island&mdash;were cultivated on plantations for the production of oil.

While French innovations enriched the cuisine in many ways, not every innovation was favorable. Since the French introduction of the prickly pear cactus in the 18th&nbsp;century, the lifestyle of southern pastoralists became increasingly reliant on the plant to ensure food and water for their zebu as well as fruit and water for themselves during the dry season between July and December. However, in 1925, a French colonist wishing to eradicate the cactus on his property in the southwestern town of [[Toliara]] introduced the [[cochineal]], an insect known to be a parasite of the plant. Within five years, nearly all the prickly pear cactus of southern Madagascar had been completely wiped out, sparking a massive famine from 1930&ndash;1931.<ref name = middleton>{{Cite journal |last=Middleton |first=Karen |title=Death and Strangers |journal=Journal of Religion in Africa |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=341&ndash;373 |year=1997}}</ref> Although these ethnic groups have since adapted in various ways, the famine period is commonly remembered as the time when their traditional lifestyle was ended by the arrival of foreigners on their land.<ref name = middleton/>

Since Madagascar gained independence from French colonial rule in 1960, Malagasy cuisine has reflected the island's diverse cultures and historic influences. Throughout the country, rice is considered the preeminent food and constitutes the main staple of the diet in all but the most arid regions of the south and west.<ref>Faubl<U+00E9>e (1942), p. 157</ref> Accompanying dishes served with rice vary regionally according to availability of ingredients and local cultural norms. Outside the home, Malagasy cuisine is served at simple roadside stalls (''gargottes'') or sit-down eateries (''hotely''). Snacks and rice-based meals may also be purchased from ambulatory street vendors. Upscale restaurants offer a wider variety of foreign cuisine and Malagasy dishes bearing French and other outside influences in preparation technique, ingredients and presentation alike.<ref name = Antal>Bradt (2011), p. 312</ref>

===Rice (vary)===
Rice (''vary'') is the cornerstone of the Malagasy diet and is typically consumed at every meal.<ref name = "Sibree1915">{{Cite book |last=Sibree |first=James |title=A Naturalist in Madagascar |publisher=J.B.

Juices are made from [[guava]], [[passion fruit]], pineapple, tamarind, baobab and other fruit. Fresh milk, however, is a luxury, and locally produced yogurts, ice creams or sweetened condensed milk mixed with hot water are the most common dairy sources of calcium. Cola and orange soft drinks are produced locally, as is ''Bonbon Anglais,'' a local sweet lemon soda. Coca-Cola products are popular and widely consumed throughout the island.<ref name=Bradt114>Bradt & Austin (2007), p. 114</ref>

Numerous alcoholic beverages are produced for local consumption and limited export.<ref name = Bradt101102/> The local [[pilsner]], Three Horses Beer, is popular and ubiquitous.

Rum serves a ritual purpose in many parts of Madagascar, where it is traditional to throw the first capful of a newly opened bottle of rum into the northeast corner of the room as an offering and gesture of respect to the ancestors.<ref>Nativel & Rajaonah (2009), p. 165</ref> At social gatherings it is common for alcoholic beverages to be accompanied with savory, fried snacks known collectively as ''tsakitsaky'', commonly including pan-fried peanuts, potato chips, nems, sambos and kaka pizon.<ref>Chan Tat Chuen (2010), pp. 49&ndash;57</ref>
