'''Nahuatl''' {{IPA|['na.wat<U+026C>]}}) and its variant spellings is a term applied to some members of the Aztecan or Nahuan sub-branch of the [[Uto-Aztecan]] language family, indigenous to central [[Mexico]]. Under the "Law of Linguistic Rights" it is recognized as a "national language" along with 62 other indigenous languages and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] which have the same "validity" in Mexico [http://www.sep.gob.mx/work/resources/LocalContent/62817/12/ley_gen_derechos_ling_indigenas_2.htm].  Nahuatl is most famous for its use by the [[Aztec]]s, a variant now known as [[Classical Nahuatl]].

==Overview==
Nahuatl is the most widely-spoken group of [[Native American (Americas)|Native American]] languages in Mexico or in North America as a whole. As is the case with most other Mexican indigenous languages, many of the speakers of Nahuatl are bilingual, having working knowledge of the [[Spanish language]]. In the past, a significant number of the Nahuatl speakers outside the Valley of Mexico were bilingual in languages other than Spanish, speaking both Nahuatl and, as their mother tongue, some other indigenous language. A famous example of bilingualism was ''[[Malintzin]]'' ("La Malinche"), the native woman who translated between Nahuatl and a [[Mayan languages|Mayan language]] (and who later learned Spanish as well) for [[Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s]].

There are an estimated 1.5 million people who speak one or another [[Nahuatl dialects|Nahuatl dialect]], some of these dialects being mutually unintelligible.  All of these dialects show influence from the Spanish language to various degrees, some of them much more than others. No modern dialects are identical with Classical Nahuatl, but those spoken in and around the [[Valley of Mexico]] are generally more-closely related to it than are peripheral ones.

Often the term ''Nahuatl'' is used specifically with reference to [[Classical Nahuatl]], the administrative language of the [[Aztec]] empire.  The Aztecs were preceded by, and surrounded by, other Nahuatl-speaking cultures, whose language certainly differed in some degree from theirs. These include the [[Tepaneca]], [[Acolhua]], [[Tlaxcala|Tlaxcalteca]], and Xochimilca; and Nahuatl was perhaps one of the languages spoken in Teotihuacan. As these groups became predominant, Nahuatl, and especially Classical Nahuatl after the ascendancy of the Aztec empire, was used as a [[lingua franca]] in much of [[Mesoamerica]] beginning from the [[12th century]] AD until the [[16th century]], at which time its prominence and influence were eclipsed by the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]]. Since we only have documentation available from that point on, and since the Spanish dealt especially with the Mexica in their administrative, religious and scholarly activities, Classical Nahuatl is for us the most available, as well as the most prestigious, early form of the language.


==Classification==
Sometimes a distinction is made among '''''Nahuan''''' languages between '''''Nahuatl''''' (variants with the characteristic ''tl'' [[phoneme]]), '''''Nahuat''''' (variants which have ''t'' in its place), and '''''Nahual''''' (variants which have ''l'' instead). Although the classification implied by emphasizing these differences is currently not given as much weight as in the past, the terms are still used. Sometimes '''''Nahuan''''' is used for the family as a whole; others use the term '''''Aztecan''''' for the family, or '''''Nahua''''' for the family and in any context where one does not want to specify the ''tl/t/l'' differences. Most commonly, however, '''''Nahuatl''''' is used as a generic name for the family or any variant of it.

Nahuatl is related to the languages spoken by the [[Hopi]], [[Comanche]], [[Paiute]] or [[Ute]], [[Pima]], [[Shoshone]], [[Tarahumara]], [[Yaqui]], [[Tepehu<U+00E1>n]], [[Huichol]] and other peoples of western North America, as they all belong to the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] linguistic stock or [[language family]] consisting of 61 individual languages. This is a grouping on the same order as [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], including a number of language families such as the Aztecan or Nahuatl family.

:<sup>**</sup>Some scholars continue to classify Aztecan and Sonoran together under a separate group (called variously "Sonoran", "Mexican", or "Southern Uto-Aztecan"). There is increasing evidence that whatever degree of additional resemblance there might be between Aztecan and Sonoran when compared with Shoshonean is probably due to proximity contact, rather than to a common immediate parent stock other than Uto-Aztecan.

==Geographic distribution==
[[Image:Nahuatl in Mexico.png|thumb|350px|Distribution of Nahuatl speakers per state.]]
A range of [[Nahuatl dialects]] are currently spoken in an area stretching from the northern Mexican state of Durango to Tabasco in the south. [[Pipil]], a Nahuatl dialect which happens to have its own name, is spoken as far south as El Salvador, by less than twenty speakers if it isnt already extinct. Another Nahuatl language, Pochutec, was spoken on the coast of [[Oaxaca|Oaxaca]] until [[circa]] 1930.  The largest concentrations of Nahuatl speakers are found in the states of [[Puebla (state)|Puebla]], [[Veracruz (state)|Veracruz]] [[Guerrero]] and [[Hidalgo]]. Significant populations are also found in [[Mexico (state)|Mexico State]], [[Morelos|Morelos]], and the [[Mexican Federal District]]. Smaller populations exist in [[Michoacan]], [[Jalisco]], [[Tabasco]], and [[Durango]].

It is likely that the speakers of Nahuatl languages originally came from the northern Mexican deserts and migrated into central Mexico in several waves. One of the last of these waves settled in what is now the [[Valley of Mexico]] and later founded what came to be known as the [[Aztec]] empire. During this period, if not before, Nahuatl became a [[Lingua franca|lingua franca]], used for trade purposes and as a prestige language in large parts of Mesoamerica, and causing the language to spread even further. For example, at the time of the Spanish conquest, the [[Quich<U+00E9>]] (Mayan) nobility spoke Nahuatl as well as the [[Quich<U+00E9> language]]. 

Currently the influx of Mexican workers into the United States has created small Nahuatl-speaking communties in the United States, particularly in New York and California.

==Phonology of Nahuan languages==
The Nahuan subgroup of Uto-Aztecan is classified partly by a number of shared phonological changes from reconstructed proto Uto-Aztecan to the attested Nahuan languages. The changes shared between the Nahuan languages are the basis for the reconstruction of the intermediate stage of proto Nahuan. Some of these changes shared by all Nahuan languages are: 

*Proto Uto-aztecan **t becomes Proto Nahuan lateral affricate *tl before proto Uto-aztecan **a 
*Proto Uto-aztecan initial **p is lost in Proto Nahuan.  
*Proto Uto-aztecan  **u merges with **i into Proto Nahuan *i
*Proto Uto-aztecan sibilants **ts and **s splits into *ts, *ch and *s, *{{IPA|<U+0283>}} respectively.
*Proto Uto-aztecan fifth vowel reconstructed as **{{IPA|<U+0268>}} or **{{IPA|<U+0259>}} merged with **e into proto Nahuan *e
*a large number of metatheses in which Proto Uto-aztecan roots of the shape **CVCV have become *VCCV. 

The table below presents some of the changes that are reconstructed from Proto Uto-aztecan to Proto Nahuan.

From the changes common to all Nahuan languages the subgroup has diversified somewhat and giving a complete overview of the phonologies of Nahuan languages is not suitable here. However, the table below shows a standardised phonemic inventory based on the inventory of Classical Nahuatl. Many modern dialects have undergone changes from proto Nahuan that have resulted in different phonemic inventories.

==Grammar==
:''For a grammatical sketch of a nahuan language see the article: [[Classical Nahuatl grammar]].''

The Nahuatl languages are [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]], [[Polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] languages that make extensive use of compounding, incorporation and derivation. That is, they can add many different [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es to a root until very long words are formed. Very long verbal forms or nouns created through incorporation and accumulation of prefixes are not uncommon in literary works. This also means that new words can be created at a moment's notice.

A minority of linguists consider the [[linguistic typology|typology]] of Nahuatl to be [[oligosynthetic language|oligosynthetic]]. This was first proposed by [[Benjamin Whorf]] in the early [[20th Century]].  However, by the mid-[[1950s]], this view was largely dismissed by the linguistic community.

===Words loaned to other languages===
:''Main article: [[words of Nahuatl origin]]''

Nahuatl has been an exceedingly rich source of words for the [[Spanish language]], as the following examples show. Some of them are restricted to Mexico or Mesoamerica, but others are common to all the Spanish-speaking regions in the world and a number of them have made their way into many other languages via Spanish.

:''achiote, acocil, aguacate, ajolote, amate, atole, axolotl, ayate, cacahuate, camote, capul<U+00ED>n, chamagoso, chapopote, chayote, chicle, chile, chipotle, chocolate, cuate, comal, copal, coyote, ejote, elote, epazote, escuincle, guacamole, guachinango, guajolote, huipil, huitlacoche, hule, jacal, j<U+00ED>cama, j<U+00ED>cara, jitomate, malacate, mecate, metate, metlapil, mezcal, mezquite, milpa, mitote, molcajete, mole, nopal, ocelote, ocote, olote, paliacate, papalote, pepenar, petaca, petate, peyote, pinole, piocha, popote, pozole, pulque, quetzal, tamal, tianguis, tiza, tomate, tule, zacate, zapote, zopilote.''

(The persistent ''-te'' or ''-le'' endings on these words are Spanish reflexes of the Nahuatl 'absolutive' ending ''-tl'', ''-tli'', or ''-li'', which appears on (most) nouns when they have no other [[affixes]].)

Nahuatl has provided the [[English language]] with some words for indigenous animals, fruits, vegetables, and tools. Most of these borrowings are second-hand, coming first through Spanish. The two most prominent are undoubtedly [[chocolate]] (from ''xoco(l)atl'', 'chocolate drink', perhaps literally 'bitter-water') and [[tomato]] (from ''(xi)tomatl''), but there are others, such as [[coyote]] (''coyotl''), [[avocado]] (''ahuacatl'') and [[chile pepper|chile or chili]] (''chilli''). The brand name [[Chiclets]] is also derived from Nahuatl (''tziktli'' 'sticky stuff, chicle'). Other English words from N<U+00E1>huatl are: [[Aztec]], (''aztecatl''); [[cacao]] (''cacahuatl'' 'shell, rind'); [[mesquite]] (''mizquitl''); [[ocelot]] (''ocelotl''). 

As a result of extensive Mexican-Philippine contacts, there are an estimated 250 words of Nahuatl origin in the [[Tagalog language]]. Some of them are: ''kamote'' 'sweet potato', ''sayote'' 'chayote', ''tiyangge'' 'seasonal market', ''tatay'' (from ''tata'', familiar vocative of ''tahtli'' 'father'), ''nanay'' (from ''nana'', familiar vocative of ''nantli'' 'mother'), ''guava'' 'guava, guayaba', ''tsokolate'' 'chocolate', ''tsanggo'' 'monkey', and the village of Zapote in [[Las Pi<U+00F1>as City]], Philippines.

Many well-known toponyms also come from Nahuatl, including ''Mexico'' (''m<U+0113>xihco'') and ''Guatemala'' (''cuauht<U+0113>mallan'').

==Writing systems==
At the time of the Spanish conquest, Aztec writing used mostly [[pictograph]]s supplemented by a few [[ideogram]]s. When needed, it also used syllabic equivalences; Father [[Dur<U+00E1>n]] recorded how the ''tlacuilos'' (codex painters) could render a prayer in Latin using this system, but it was difficult to use. This writing system was adequate for keeping such records as genealogies, astronomical information, and tribute lists, but could not represent a full vocabulary of spoken language in the way that the writing systems of the old world or of the [[Maya civilization]] could. The Aztec writing was not meant to be read, but to be told; the elaborate codices were essentially pictographic aids for teaching, and long texts were memorized.

The Spanish introduced the Roman script, which was then utilized to record a large body of Aztec prose and poetry, a fact which somewhat mitigated the devastating loss of the thousands of Aztec manuscripts which were burned by the Spanish. (See [[Nahuatl transcription]] and [[Aztec codices]].) Important lexical works (e.g. [[Fray Alonzo de Molina|Molina]]'s classic ''Vocabulario'' of 1571) and grammatical descriptions (of which [[Carochi]]'s 1645 ''Arte'' is generally acknowledged the best) were produced using variations of this [[orthography]].

The classical orthography was not perfect, and in fact there were many variations in how it was applied, due in part to dialectal differences and in part to differing traditions and preferences that developed. (The writing of Spanish itself was far from totally standardized at the time.) Today, although almost all written Nahuatl uses some form of Latin-based orthography, there continue to be strong dialectal differences, and considerable debate and differing practices regarding how to write sounds even when they are the same. Major issues are 
*whether to follow Spanish in writing the {{IPA|/k/}} sound sometimes as ''c'' and sometimes as ''qu'' or just to use ''k''
*how to write {{IPA|/k<U+02B7>/}} 
*what to do about {{IPA|/w/}}, the realization of which varies considerably from place to place and even within a single dialect
*how to write the "saltillo", phonetically a [[glottal stop]] ({{IPA|[<U+0294>]}}) or an {{IPA|[h]}}, which has been spelled with ''j'', ''h'', and a  straight apostrophe ('), but which traditionally was often omitted in writing. 
There are a number of other issues as well, such as 
*whether and how to represent vowel length 
*how and whether to represent sound variants (allophones) which sound like different Spanish sounds [phonemes], especially variants of ''o'' which come close to ''u''
*to what extent writing in one variant should be adapted towards what is used in other variants. 

The ''Secretar<U+00ED>a de Educaci<U+00F3>n P<U+00FA>blica'' (Ministry of Public Education) has adopted an alphabet for its bilingual education programs in rural communities in [[Mexico]] in which ''k'' is used and {{IPA|/w/}} is written as ''u'', and this decision has been influential. The recently established (2004) "[[Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Ind<U+00ED>genas]]" ([[INALI]]) will also be involved in these issues.

==History==
Nahuatl is often referred to as the Aztec language, or (especially in Spanish) as the Mexican language, because it was the language of the Mexica, i.e. the Aztecs. It was not spoken only by the Mexica, however, but by many other groups, including such predecessors and contemporaries of the Mexica as the Colhua, the [[Tepanec]], the [[Acolhua]], various [[Chichimeca]] groups, and the famous [[Toltec]]s in one interpretation of the term. Increasingly, suggestions have been appearing, from several diverse fields of Mesoamerican research, that Nahuatl may have been one of the languages spoken at the legendary [[Teotihuacan]].

===Literature===
Nahuatl literature is extensive (probably the most extensive of all [[Amerindian]] languages), including a relatively large corpus of [[poetry]] (see also [[Nezahualcoyotl]]); the ''[[Huei tlamahui<U+00E7>oltica]]'' is an example of literary Nahuatl from the seventeenth century.  Examples from the time immediately following the conquest include at least one census from the 1540s.  The two largest collections of poetry, the ''Cantares mexicanos'' and the ''Romances de los se<U+00F1>ores de la Nueva Espa<U+00F1>a'', were in all likelihood copied down in the 1560s or somewhat later.  The mammoth encyclopedia of Aztec culture known as the ''[[Florentine Codex]]'' was compiled by the Franciscan Fr. [[Bernardino de Sahagun]], with the assistance of tri-lingual students from the Colegio de Santacruz Tlatelolco at about the same time.
