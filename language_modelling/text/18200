The '''Polish-Soviet War''' (February [[1919]] <U+2013> March [[1921]]) was an armed conflict of [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]] and [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]] against the [[Second Polish Republic]] and the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], four [[nascent]] states in post-[[World War I]] [[Europe]]. The war was the result of conflicting expansionist attempts. Poland, whose statehood had just been re-established  by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] following the [[Partitions of Poland]] in the late 18th century, sought to secure territories which she had lost at the time of partitions; the Soviets' aim was to control those same territories, which had been part of [[Imperial Russia]] until the turbulent events of the [[World War I|Great War]]. Both States claimed victory<ref name="result" /> in the war: the Poles claimed a successful defense of their state, while the Soviets claimed a repulse of the Polish [[Kiev Offensive (1920)|eastward invasion of Ukraine]] and Belarus, which they viewed as a part of [[Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War|foreign intervention in the Russian Civil War]].

The frontiers between Poland and Soviet Russia had not been defined in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and post-war events created turmoil: the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]; the crumbling of the [[Imperial Russia|Russian]], [[German Empire|German]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] empires; the [[Russian Civil War]]; the [[Central Powers]]' withdrawal from the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|eastern front]]; and the attempts of [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukraine]] and [[Belarusian National Republic|Belarus]] to establish their independence. Poland's [[Chief of State]], [[J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski]], felt the time expedient to expand Polish borders as far east as feasible, to be followed by the creation of a Polish-led federation ([[Mi<U+0119>dzymorze]]) of several states in the rest of East-Central Europe as a bulwark against the potential re-emergence of both German and Russian [[imperialism]]. [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], meanwhile, saw Poland as the bridge that the [[Red Army]] would have to cross in order to assist [[Communist Party of Germany|other communist movements]] and help conduct other European revolutions.

By [[1919]], the Polish forces had taken control of much of Western Ukraine, with victory in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]]; the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] had tried unsuccessfully to create a Ukrainian state on territories to which both Poles and the Ukrainians laid claim. At the same time, the Bolsheviks began to gain the upper hand in the Russian Civil War and advance westward towards the disputed territories. By the end of 1919 a clear front had formed. Border skirmishes escalated into open warfare following Pi<U+0142>sudski's [[1920 Kiev Offensive|major incursion further east into Ukraine]] in April 1920. He was met by a nearly simultaneous and initially very successful Red Army [[counterattack]]. The Soviet operation threw the Polish forces back westward all the way to the Polish capital, [[Warsaw]]. Meanwhile, western fears of Soviet troops arriving at the German frontiers [[Interallied Mission to Poland|increased the interest of Western powers]] in the war. In midsummer, the fall of Warsaw seemed certain but in mid-August the tide had turned again as the Polish forces achieved an unexpected and decisive victory at the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]]. In the wake of the Polish advance eastward, the Soviets sued for peace and the war ended with a [[ceasefire]] in October 1920. A formal [[peace treaty]], the [[Peace of Riga]], was signed on [[18 March]], [[1921]], dividing the disputed territories between Poland and Soviet Russia. The war largely determined the Soviet-Polish border for the [[interbellum|period between the World Wars]].

== Names and dates ==
The war is referred to by several names. "Polish-Soviet War" may be the most common, but is potentially confusing since "Soviet" is usually thought of as relating to the [[Soviet Union]], which (by contrast with "[[Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]") did not officially come into being until December 1922. Alternative names include "Russo-Polish War<ref name=EB>See for instance [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9064493 Russo-Polish War] in [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]<br>''Russo-Polish War (1919<U+2013>20), military conflict between Soviet Russia and Poland, which sought to seize Ukraine (...) Although there had been hostilities between the two countries during 1919, the conflict began when the Polish head of state J<U+00F3>zef Pilsudski formed an alliance with the Ukrainian nationalist leader Symon Petlura (April 21, 1920) and their combined forces began to overrun Ukraine, occupying Kiev on May 7.''</ref> [or Polish-Russian War] of 1919<U+2013>20/21" (to distinguish it from earlier Polish-Russian wars) and "Polish-Bolshevik War".<ref name="PWN:wojna">{{pl icon}} [http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=3997498 Wojna polsko-bolszewicka].

In some Polish sources it is also referred as the "War of 1920" (Polish: ''Wojna 1920 roku'').<ref name="Wojna1920roku">For example: 1) [[Janusz Cisek|Cisek, Janusz]], ''S<U+0105>siedzi wobec wojny 1920 roku.

Other points of contention are the starting and ending dates of the war. For example, [[Encyclopedia Britannica]] begins its article with the date (1919-1920), but then says "Although there had been hostilities between the two countries during 1919, the conflict began when the Polish head of state J<U+00F3>zef Pilsudski formed an alliance with the Ukrainian nationalist leader Symon Petlyura (April 21, 1920) and their combined forces began to overrun Ukraine, occupying Kiev on May 7."<ref name=EB/> while the Polish [[Internetowa encyklopedia PWN]]<ref name="PWN:wojna"/> as well as some historians<U+2014>like [[Norman Davies]]<ref name="Davies_WERS-22">[[Norman Davies|Davies, Norman]], ''[[White Eagle, Red Star]]: the Polish-Soviet War, 1919<U+2013>20'', Pimlico, 2003, ISBN 0-7126-0694-7. (First edition: New York, St. Martin's Press, inc., 1972.) Page 22</ref><U+2014>clearly consider 1919 as the starting year of the war. The ending date is given as either 1920 or 1921; this confusion stems from the fact that while the [[ceasefire]] was put in force in fall 1920, the [[Treaty of Riga|official treaty ending the war]] was signed months later, in March 1921.

While the events of 1919 can be described as a border conflict and only in early 1920 did both sides realize that they were in fact engaged in an all-out war,<ref name="Davies_WERS-22"/> the conflicts that took place in 1919 are closely related to the war that began in earnest a year later.<ref name="Davies_WERS-22"/> In the end, the events of 1920 were only a logical, though unforeseen, consequence of the 1919 prelude.<ref name="Davies_WERS-22"/>

With the success of the [[Wielkopolska Uprising (1918<U+2013>1919)|Greater Poland Uprising in 1918]], Poland had re-established its [[statehood]] for the first time since the [[Partitions of Poland#Third Partition|1795 partition]] and seen the end of a 123 years of rule by three imperial neighbors: [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], [[German Empire|Germany]],  and [[Austria-Hungary]]. The country, reborn as a [[Second Polish Republic]], proceeded to carve out its borders from the territories of its former partitioners.

Poland was not alone in its newfound opportunities and troubles. Virtually all of the newly independent neighbours began fighting over borders: [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] fought with [[Hungary]] over [[Transylvania]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] with [[Italy]] over [[Rijeka]], Poland with [[Czechoslovakia]] over [[Cieszyn|Cieszyn/T<U+011B><U+0161><U+00ED>n]], with Germany over [[Pozna<U+0144>]] and [[Polish-Ukrainian War|with Ukrainians]] over [[Eastern Galicia]].

{{main|Polish-Soviet War in 1919}}
==== Chaos in Eastern Europe ====
In 1918 the German Army in the east, under the command of [[Max Hoffmann]], began to retreat westwards. The territories abandoned by the [[Central Powers]] (Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and [[History of Independent Bulgaria#World War I|Bulgaria]]) became a field of conflict among local governments created by Germany, other local governments that independently sprang up after the German retreat, and the Bolsheviks, who hoped to incorporate those areas into Soviet Russia.<ref name="Cienciala"/> As a result, almost all of Eastern Europe was in chaos.<ref name="FDH"/><ref name="AHP"/>

On [[November 18]], [[1918]], the [[Soviet Supreme Command]] issued orders to the [[Western Army (Russia)|Western Army]] of the [[Red Army]] to begin a [[Russian westward offensive of 1918-1919|westward movement]] that would follow the withdrawing German troops of Oberkommando Ostfront ([[Ober-Ost]]). The basic aim was to secure as much territory as possible with the few resources locally available. 

At the start of 1919, Polish-Soviet fighting broke out almost by accident and without any orders from the respective governments<ref name="Davies_WERS-22"/> when self-organized Polish military units in [[Vilnius]] (Wilno) clashed with Bolshevik forces of [[Litbel]], each trying to secure the territories for its own incipient government. Eventually the more organized Soviet forces quelled most of the resistance and drove the remaining Polish forces west. On [[January 5]], 1919, the Red Army entered [[Minsk]] almost unopposed, thus putting an end to the short-lived [[Belarusian People's Republic]]. At the same time, more and more Polish self-defense units sprang up across western Belarus and Lithuania (such as the [[Lithuanian and Belarusian Self-Defence]]).<ref name="Samoobrona">[[Grzegorz <U+0141>ukowski|<U+0141>ukowski, Grzegorz]] and [[Rafa<U+0142> E.

The newly organized [[Polish Army]] began sending the first of their units east to assist the self-defense forces, while the Russians sent their own units west.

In the spring of 1919, Soviet conscription produced a Red Army of 2,300,000.<ref name="Figes">{{en icon}} {{cite journal | author = Orlando Figes | year =1990 | month =November | title =The Red Army and Mass Mobilization during the Russian Civil War 1918-1920 | journal =Past and Present | volume = | issue =129 | pages =168-211 | id = | url =http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0031-2746(199011)129%3C168%3ATRAAMM%3E2.0.CO%3B2-J | format = | accessdate = }}</ref> Few of these were sent west that year, as the majority of Red Army forces were engaged against the Russian [[White movement]]; the Western Army in February 1919 had just 46,000 men.<ref name="Davies_WERS-39">[[Norman Davies|Davies, Norman]], ''White Eagle, Red Star: the Polish-Soviet War, 1919<U+2013>20'', Pimlico, 2003, ISBN 0-7126-0694-7.

By [[14 February]], the Poles, who had been advancing eastwards, secured positions along the line of [[Kobryn]], [[Pruzhany]], and the rivers [[Zalewianka]] and [[Neman River|Neman]]. Around [[14 February]], at [[Mosty]], the first organised Polish units made contact with the advance units of the Red Army. Bolshevik units withdrew without a shot.<ref name="PWN:wojna"/> A frontline slowly began to form from Lithuania, through Belarus to Ukraine.

==== First Polish-Soviet conflicts ====
The [[Battle of Bereza Kartuska (1919)|first serious armed conflict of the war]] took place around [[February 14]]<ref name="Davies_GP_292"/><ref name="Davies_WERS-22"/> - [[February 16]], near the towns of Maniewicze and Biaroza in Belarus.<ref name="Cienciala"/><ref name="PWN:wojna"/> By late February [[Target Vistula|the Soviet advance]] had come to a halt. Both Polish and Soviet forces had also been [[Polish-Ukrainian War|engaging the Ukrainian forces]], and unrest was growing in the territories of the Baltic countries (cf. [[Estonian Liberation War]], [[Latvian War of Independence]], [[Freedom wars of Lithuania]]).

[[Image:PBW December 1919.png|thumb|right|200px|Central and Eastern Europe in December 1919]]
In early March 1919, Polish units started an offensive, crossing the [[Neman River]], taking [[Pinsk]], and reaching the outskirts of [[Lida]]. Both the Russian and Polish advances began around the same time in April (Polish forces started a major offensive on April 16<ref name="PWN:wojna"/>), resulting in increasing numbers of troops arriving in the area. That month the Bolsheviks captured [[Grodno]], but soon were pushed out by a Polish counteroffensive.  Unable to accomplish their objectives and facing strengthening offensives from the White forces, the Red Army withdrew from their positions and reorganized. Soon the Polish-Soviet War would begin in earnest.

Polish forces continued a steady eastern advance.<ref name="PWN:wojna"/> They took [[Lida]] on April 17<ref name="PWN:wojna"/> and [[Nowogr<U+00F3>dek]] on April 18, and recaptured Vilnius on April 19, driving the [[Litbel]] government from their proclaimed capital.<ref name="Cienciala"/> On August 8, Polish forces took [[Minsk]]<ref name="PWN:wojna"/> and on the 28th of that month they deployed [[tank]]s for the first time. After heavy fighting, the town of [[Babruysk]] near the [[Berezina River]] was captured.<ref name="PWN:wojna"/> By October 2, Polish forces reached the [[Daugava]] river and secured the region from [[Desna (river)|Desna]] to [[Daugavpils]] (Dyneburg).<ref name="PWN:wojna"/>

Polish success continued until early 1920.<ref name="PWN:wojna"/> Sporadic battles erupted between Polish forces and the [[Red Army]], but the latter was preoccupied with the White counter-revolutionary forces and was steadily retreating on the entire western frontline, from [[Latvia]] in the north to Ukraine in the south. In early summer 1919, the White movement had gained the initiative, and its forces under the command of [[Anton Denikin]] were marching on [[Moscow]]. Pi<U+0142>sudski viewed the Bolsheviks as a lesser threat to Poland than their contenders,<ref name="Kenez">[[Peter Kenez]], ''A History of the Soviet Union from the Beginning to the End'', Cambridge University Press, 1999, ISBN 0-521-31198-5, [http://books.google.com/books?id=aIY9qb6iIEcC&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&sig=DOZgge7R-dNB7KTNOVV_QWrE8KI Google Print, p. 37]</ref> as the White Russians were not willing to accept Poland's independence, while the Bolsheviks did proclaim the [[Partitions of Poland]] null and void. By his refusal to join the attack on Lenin's struggling government, ignoring the strong pressure from the [[Triple Entente|Entente]], Pi<U+0142>sudski had likely saved the Bolshevik government in Summer<U+2013>Fall 1919. He later wrote that in case of a White victory, in the east Poland could only gain the "ethnic border" at best (the [[Curzon line]]).<ref name=Pidluts>{{ru icon}}{{uk icon}} Oleksa Pidlutskyi, ''Postati XX stolittia'', (Figures of the 20th century), [[Kiev]], 2004, ISBN 966-8290-01-1, {{LCCN|20||04440333}}.

In 1919, several unsuccessful attempts at peace negotiations were made by various Polish and Russian factions.<ref name="PWN:wojna"/> In the meantime, Polish-Lithuanian relations worsened as Polish politicians found it hard to accept the Lithuanians' demands for independence and territories, especially on ceding the city of [[Vilnius]] (Wilno), Lithuania's historical capital which had a Polish ethnic majority. Polish negotiators made better progress with the [[Latvia]]n Provisional Government, and in late 1919 and early 1920 Polish and Latvian forces were conducting [[Operation Zima|joint operations]] against Russia.<ref name="Kochan">[[Daniel Kochan]], [http://www.polska-zbrojna.pl/artykul.html?id_artykul=177 <U+0141>otewski sojusznik].

The [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Warsaw Treaty]], an agreement with the exiled Ukrainian nationalist leader [[Symon Petlura]] signed on [[April 21]], [[1920]], was the main Polish diplomatic success. Petlura, who formally represented the government of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (by then ''de facto'' defeated by Bolsheviks), along with some Ukrainian forces, fled to Poland, where he found [[political asylum|asylum]]. His control extended only to a sliver of land near the Polish border.<ref name=Watt>{{cite book | first= Richard| last= [[Watt]] | title=Bitter Glory: Poland and its Fate 1918-1939 | location= New York | publisher=Simon and Schuster | year=1979 | id=ISBN 0-671-22625-8 | pages = 119}}</ref> In such conditions, there was little difficulty convincing Petlura to join an alliance with Poland, despite recent conflict between the two nations that had been settled in favour of Poland.<ref name=Debo210>Richard K Debo, ''Survival and Consolidation: The Foreign Policy of Soviet Russia, 1918-1921'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=gQfUB0CXBO4C&pg=PA210&lpg=PA210&sig=h6VOdNEyN1vXvCG5O-UctzERPNc pp. 210-211], McGill-Queen's Press, 1992, ISBN 0-7735-0828-7.</ref> By concluding an agreement with Pi<U+0142>sudski, Petlura accepted the Polish territorial gains in Western Ukraine and the future Polish-Ukrainian border along the [[Zbruch River]]. In exchange, he was promised independence for Ukraine and Polish military assistance in reinstalling his government in Kiev.<ref name="Cienciala"/> 

For Pi<U+0142>sudski, this alliance gave his campaign for the Mi<U+0119>dzymorze federation the legitimacy of joint international effort, secured part of the Polish eastward border, and laid a foundation for a Polish dominated Ukrainian state between Russia and Poland.<ref name=Debo210/> For Petlura, this was a final chance to preserve the statehood and, at least, the theoretical independence of the Ukrainian heartlands, even while accepting the loss of Western Ukrainian lands to Poland.<ref name=ZerkDestiny>"In September 1919 the armies of the Ukrainian Directory in Podolia found themselves in the "death triangle". They were squeezed between the Red Russians of Lenin and Trotsky in the north-east, White Russians of Denikin in south-east and the Poles in the West. Death were looking into their eyes. And not only to the people but to the nascent Ukrainian state. Therefore, the chief ataman Petlura had no choice but to accept the union offered by Pi<U+0142>sudski, or, as an alternative, to capitulate to the Bolsheviks, as Volodymyr Vinnychenko or Mykhailo Hrushevsky did at the time or in a year or two. The decision was very hurtful. The Polish Szlachta was a historic enemy of the Ukrainian people. A fresh wound was bleeding, the West Ukrainian People's Republic, as the Pilsudchiks were suppressing the East Galicians at that very moment. However, Petlura agreed to peace and the union, accepting the Ukrainian-Polish border, the future Soviet-Polish one. It's also noteworthy that Pi<U+0142>sudski also obtained less territories than offered to him by Lenin, and, in addition, the war with immense Russia. The Dnieper Ukrainians then were abandoning their brothers, the Galicia Ukrainians, to their fate. However, Petlura wanted to use his last chance to preserve the statehood - in the union with the Poles. Attempted, however, without luck."<br>Oleksa Pidlutskyi, ''ibid''</ref> 

Yet both of them were opposed at home. Pi<U+0142>sudski faced stiff opposition from Dmowski's [[National Democrats (Poland)|National Democrats]] who opposed Ukrainian independence. Petlura, in turn, was criticized by many Ukrainian politicians for entering a pact with the Poles and giving up on Western Ukraine.<ref name=Pyrig>Prof. Ruslan Pyrig, "''Mykhailo Hrushevsky and the Bolsheviks: the price of political compromise''", ''[[Zerkalo Nedeli]]'', September 30 - October 6, 2006, available online [http://www.zerkalo-nedeli.com/nn/show/616/54623/ in Russian] and [http://www.zn.kiev.ua/ie/show/616/54623/ in Ukrainian].</ref> <ref name="Suny"/><ref name=ZerkDestiny/><ref name="Snyder">[[Timothy Snyder]], ''The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569-1999'', Yale University Press, ISBN 0-300-10586-X[http://books.google.com/books?id=xSpEynLxJ1MC&pg=PA139&lpg=PA139&sig=FdpjUHK5s9CgwEYKaDXPKvoyeH0 Google Books, p.139]</ref>

The alliance with Petliura did result in 15,000 pro-Polish allied Ukrainian troops at the beginning of the campaign,<ref name="Subtelny375">{{cite book| author=Subtelny, O. | title=Ukraine: A History| location= Toronto | publisher= University of Toronto Press | year = 1988 | pages = 375}}</ref> increasing to 35,000 through recruitment and desertion from the Soviet side during the war.<ref name="Subtelny375"/> But in the end, this would prove too few to support Petlura's hopes for indenpendent Ukraine, or Pi<U+0142>sudski's dreams of the Ukrainian ally in the Mi<U+0119>dzymorze federation.

[[Norman Davies]] notes that estimating strength of the opposing sides is very tricky; even generals often had incomplete reports of their own forces.<ref name="Davies_WERS-106pl"/>

By early 1920, the Red Army had been very successful against the [[White movement|White armies]].<ref name="Dparker"/> They defeated [[Denikin]] and signed peace treaties with Latvia and Estonia. The Polish front became their most important war theater and a plurality of Soviet resources and forces were diverted to it. In January 1920, the Red Army began concentrating a 700,000-strong force near the [[Berezina River]] and on Belarus.<ref name="Davies_GP_292"/> 

By the time Poles launched their Kiev offensive, The Red Southwestern Front had about 82,847 soldiers including 28,568 front-line troops. The Poles had some numerical superiority, estimated from 12,000 to 52,000 personnel.<ref name="Davies_WERS-106pl">Davies, ''White Eagle...'', Polish edition, p.106</ref> By the time of the Soviet counter-offensive in mid 1920 the situation had been reversed: Soviets had about 790,000 people - at least 50,000 or more than the Poles; Tukhachevsky estimated that he had 160,000 "combat-ready" soldiers; Pi<U+0142>sudski estimated enemy's forces at 200,000-220,000.<ref name="Davies_WERS-142pl">Davies, ''White Eagle...'', Polish edition, p.142-143</ref>

In the course of 1920, almost 800,000<ref name="Davies_WERS-142">[[Norman Davies|Davies, Norman]], ''White Eagle, Red Star: the Polish-Soviet War, 1919<U+2013>20'', Pimlico, 2003, ISBN 0-7126-0694-7.

Bolshevik commanders in the Red Army's coming offensive would include [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] (new commander of the Western Front), [[Aleksandr Yegorov]] (new commander of the Southwestern Front), the future Soviet ruler [[Joseph Stalin]], and the founder of the [[Cheka]] (secret police), [[Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky]].

The Polish Army was made up of soldiers who had formerly served in the various partitioning empires, supported by some international volunteers, such as the [[Ko<U+015B>ciuszko Squadron]].<ref name="KoscSq">[[Janusz Cisek]], ''Kosciuszko, We Are Here: American Pilots of the Kosciuszko Squadron in Defense of Poland, 1919-1921'', McFarland & Company, 2002, ISBN 0-7864-1240-2, [http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=0786412402&btnG=Search+Books&as_brr=0 Google Print]</ref> [[Boris Savinkov]] was at the head of an army of 20,000 to 30,000 largely Russian POWs, and was accompanied by [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]] and [[Zinaida Gippius]]. The Polish forces grew from approximately 100,000 in 1918 to over 500,000 in early 1920.<ref name="Davies_WERS-83"/> In August, 1920, the Polish army had reached a total strength of 737,767 people; half of that was on the frontline. Given Soviet losses, there was rough numerical parity between the two armies; and by the time of the [[battle of Warsaw]] Poles might have even had a slight advantage in numbers and logistics.<ref name="Davies_WERS-196;202pl">Davies, ''White Eagle...'', Polish edition, p.162 and p.202.</ref>

[[Logistics]], nonetheless, were very bad for both armies, supported by whatever equipment was left over from World War I or could be captured. The Polish Army, for example, employed guns made in five countries, and [[rifle]]s manufactured in six, each using different ammunition.<ref name="Davies_WERS-85"/> The Soviets had many military depots at their disposal, left by withdrawing German armies in 1918-19, and modern French armaments captured in great numbers from the White Russians and the Allied expeditionary forces in the Russian Civil War.

The Soviet High Command planned a new offensive in late April/May.

Until April, the Polish forces had been slowly but steadily advancing eastward. The new [[Latvia]]n government requested and obtained Polish help in capturing [[Daugavpils]]. The city [[Battle of Daugavpils|fell after heavy fighting]] in January and was handed over to the Latvians, who viewed the Poles as liberators.<ref name="Kochan"/> By March, Polish forces had driven a wedge between Soviet forces to the north (Byelorussia) and south (Ukraine).

On [[April 24]], Poland began its main offensive, [[Kiev Offensive (1920)|Operation Kiev]]. Its goal was the creation of independent Ukraine<ref name="Cienciala"/> that would become part of Pi<U+0142>sudski's project of a "[[Mi<U+0119>dzymorze]]" Federation. Poland's forces were assisted by 15,000 Ukrainian soldiers under [[Symon Petlura]], representing the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].<ref name="Subtelny375"/>

On [[April 26]], in his "Call to the People of Ukraine", Pi<U+0142>sudski assured that "the Polish army would only stay as long as necessary until a legal Ukrainian government took control over its own territory".<ref name="Odezwa">{{pl icon}}, [[W<U+0142>odzimierz B<U+0105>czkowski]], [http://www.omp.org.pl/index.php?module=subjects&func=viewpage&pageid=8 W<U+0142>odzimierz B<U+0105>czkowski - Czy prometeizm jest fikcj<U+0105> i fantazj<U+0105>?], O<U+015B>rodek My<U+015B>li Politycznej (quoting full text of "odezwa J<U+00F3>zefa Pi<U+0142>sudskiego do mieszka<U+0144>c<U+00F3>w Ukrainy").

The Polish 3rd Army easily won border clashes with the Red Army in Ukraine but the Reds withdrew with minimal losses. The combined Polish-Ukrainian forces entered an abandoned [[Kiev]] on [[May 7]], encountering only token resistance.<ref name="Cienciala"/>

The Polish military thrust was met with [[Red Army]] [[counterattack]]s on [[29 May]].<ref name="PWN:wojna"/> Polish forces in the area, preparing for an offensive towards [[<U+017D>lobin]], managed to push the Soviets back, but were unable to start their own planned offensive. In the north, Polish forces had fared much worse. The Polish 1st Army was defeated and forced to retreat, pursued by the Russian 15th Army which recaptured territories between the [[Western Dvina]] and [[Berezina]] rivers. Polish forces attempted to take advantage of the exposed flanks of the attackers but the enveloping forces failed to stop the Soviet advance. At the end of May, the front had stabilised near the small river [[Auta]], and Soviet forces began preparing for the next push.

On [[May 24]] 1920, the Polish forces in the south were engaged for the first time by [[Semjon Budyonny|Semyon Budionny's]] famous [[1st Cavalry Army]] (''Konarmia''). Repeated attacks by Budionny's [[Cossack]] cavalry broke the Polish-Ukrainian front on [[June 5]].<ref name="PWN:wojna"/> The Soviets then deployed mobile cavalry units to disrupt the Polish rearguard, targeting communications and logistics. By [[June 10]], Polish armies were in retreat along the entire front. On [[June 13]], the Polish army, along with the Petlura's Ukrainian troops, abandoned Kiev to the Red Army.

The commander of the Polish 3rd Army in Ukraine, General [[Edward Rydz-<U+015A>mig<U+0142>y]], decided to break through the Soviet line toward the northwest. Polish forces in Ukraine managed to withdraw relatively unscathed, but were unable to support the northern front and reinforce the defenses at the [[Auta River]] for the decisive battle that was soon to take place there.<ref name="Lawrynowicz">[http://www.hetmanusa.org/engarticle1.html Battle Of Warsaw 1920 by Witold Lawrynowicz; A detailed write-up, with bibliography].

Due to insufficient forces, Poland's 200-mile-long front was manned by a thin line of 120,000 troops backed by some 460 artillery pieces with no strategic reserves. This approach to holding ground harked back to [[Great War]] practice of "establishing a fortified line of defense". It had shown some merit on a Western Front saturated with troops, machine guns, and artillery. Poland's eastern front, however, was weakly manned, supported with inadequate artillery, and had almost no fortifications.<ref name="Lawrynowicz"/> 

Against the Polish line the Red Army gathered their Northwest Front led by the young General [[Mikhail Tukhachevski]]. Their numbers exceeded 108,000 infantry and 11,000 cavalry, supported by 722 artillery pieces and 2,913 machine guns. The Russians at some crucial places outnumbered the Poles four-to-one.<ref name="Lawrynowicz"/> 

Tukhachevski launched his offensive on [[July 4]], along the [[Smolensk]]-[[Brest-Litovsk]] axis, crossing the [[Auta]] and [[Berezina]] rivers.<ref name="PWN:wojna"/> The northern 3rd Cavalry Corps, led by [[Gayk Bzhishkyan]] (Gay Dmitrievich Gay, Gaj-Chan), were to envelope Polish forces from the north, moving near the Lithuanian and Prussian border (both of these belonging to nations hostile to Poland). The 4th, 15th, and 3rd Armies were to push decisively west, supported from the south by the 16th Army and Grupa Mozyrska. For three days the outcome of the battle hung in the balance, but the Russians' numerical superiority proved decisive and by [[July 7]] Polish forces were in full retreat along the entire front. However, due to the stubborn defense by Polish units, Tukhachevsky's plan to break through the front and push the defenders southwest into the [[Pinsk Marshes]] failed.<ref name="Lawrynowicz"/> 

Polish resistance was offered again on a line of "German trenches", a heavily fortified line of World War I field fortifications that presented a unique opportunity to stem the Russian offensive. However, the Polish troops were insufficient in number. Soviet forces selected a weakly defended part of the front and broke through. Gej-Chan and Lithuanian forces captured Wilno on [[14 July]], forcing the Poles to retreat again. In [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] to the south, General [[Semyon Budyonny]]'s cavalry advanced far into the Polish rear, capturing [[Brodno]] and approaching [[Lw<U+00F3>w]] and [[Zamo<U+015B><U+0107>]]. In early July, it became clear to the Poles that the Russians' objectives were not limited to pushing their borders westwards. Poland's very independence was at stake.<ref name="Lukowski">[[Jerzy Lukowski]], [[Hubert Zawadzki]], ''A Concise History of Poland'', Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-55917-0, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521559170&id=NpMxTvBuWHYC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=Polish+independence+1920&sig=UPANmW8JC1oZuaBL6mx2o-6xExw Google Print, p.203]</ref>

Russian forces moved forward at the remarkable rate of 20 miles a day. [[Grodno]] in Belarus fell on [[19 July]]; Brest-Litovsk fell on [[1 August]]. The Polish attempted to defend the [[Bug River]] line with 4th Army and Grupa Poleska units, but were able to stop the Red Army advance for only one week. After crossing the [[Narew River]] on [[2 August]], the Russian Northwest Front was only 60 miles from Warsaw.<ref name="PWN:wojna"/> The [[Brest-Litovsk fortress]] which was to be the headquarters of the planned Polish counteroffensive fell to the 16th Army in the first attack. Stalin in charge of the Russian Southwest Front, and was pushing the Polish forces out of Ukraine and then disobeyed orders and closed on Zamo<U+015B><U+0107> and [[Lw<U+00F3>w]], the largest city in southeastern Poland and an important industrial center, defended by the Polish 6th Army. Polish Galicia's Lviv (Lw<U+00F3>w) was soon [[Battle of Lw<U+00F3>w (1920)|besieged]]. So opening up a hole in the Russian lines as at the same time the way to the Polish capital lay open and five Russian armies approached Warsaw. Polish politicians tried to secure peace with Moscow on any conditions but the Bolsheviks refused.<ref name=Pidluts/>

Polish forces in Galicia near Lviv launched a successful counteroffensive to slow the Soviets down which stopped the retreat of Polish forces on the southern front. However, the worsening situation near the Polish capital of Warsaw prevented the Poles from continuing that southern counteroffensive and pushing east. Forces were mustered to take part in the coming battle for Warsaw.<ref>A.

==== Diplomatic Front, Part 2: The political games ====
With the tide turning against Poland, Pi<U+0142>sudski's political power weakened, while his opponents', including [[Roman Dmowski]]'s, rose. Pi<U+0142>sudski did manage to regain his influence, especially over the military, almost at the last possible moment<U+2014>as the Soviet forces were approaching Warsaw. The Polish political scene had begun to unravel in panic, with the government of [[Leopold Skulski]] resigning in early June.

Meawhile, the Soviet leadership's confidence soared.<ref name=LeninSpeach>At a closed meeting of the 9th Conference of the Russian Communist Party on September 22, 1920, Lenin said: "We confronted the question: whether [...] to take advantage of the enthusiasm in our army and the advantage which we enjoyed to sovietize Poland... the defensive war against imperialism was over, we won it... We could and should take advantage of the military situation to begin an offensive war... we should poke about with bayonets to see whether the socialist revolution of the proletariat had not ripened in Poland... that somewhere near Warsaw lies not [only] the center of the Polish bourgeois government and the republic of capital, but the center of the whole contemporary system of international imperialism, and that circumstances enabled us to shake that system, and to conduct politics not in Poland but in Germany and England. In this manner, in Germany and England we created a completely new zone of proletarian revolution against global imperialism... By destroying the Polish army we are destroying the Versailles Treaty on which nowadays the entire system of international relations is based.....Had Poland become Soviet....the Versailles Treaty ...and with it the whole international system arising from the victories over Germany, would have been destroyed."<br> English translation quoted from [[Richard Pipes]], RUSSIA UNDER THE BOLSHEVIK REGIME, New York, 1993, pp.181-182, with some stylistic modification in par 3, line 3, by A.

Western public opinion was strongly pro-Soviet. Britain's Prime Minister, [[David Lloyd George]], who wanted to negotiate a favourable trade agreement with the Bolsheviks<ref name="Cienciala"/> pressed Poland to make peace on Soviet terms and refused any assistance to Poland which would alienate the Whites in the Russian Civil War. In July 1920, Britain announced it would send huge quantities of World War I surplus military supplies to Poland, but a threatened general strike by the [[Trades Union Congress]], who objected to British support of "White Poland", ensured that none of the weapons destined for Poland left British ports. David Lloyd George had never been enthusiastic about supporting the Poles, and had been pressured by his more right-wing Cabinet members such as [[Lord Curzon]] and [[Winston Churchill]] into offering the supplies. On the 11 July, 1920, the government of Great Britain issued a ''de facto'' [[ultimatum]] to the Soviets.<ref name="ultim">''The Military History of the Soviet Union'', Palgrave, 2002, ISBN 0-312-29398-4, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0312293984&id=ZBNrnEcRNjsC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=11+July+1920+ultimatum&sig=k29sbe-Ds_qJYf7Ab3pb-ZwHSGs Google Print, p.41]</ref> The Soviets were ordered to stop hostilities against Poland and the Russian Army (the White Army in Southern Russia lead by Baron Wrangel), and to accept what later was called the "[[Curzon line]]" as a temporary border with Poland, until a permanent border could be established in negotiations.<ref name="Cienciala"/> In case of Soviet refusal, the British threatened to assist Poland with all the means available, which, in reality, were limited by the internal political situation in the United Kingdom. On the 17  July, the Bolsheviks refused<ref name="Cienciala"/> and made a counter-offer to negotiate a peace treaty directly with Poland. The British responded by threatening to cut off the on-going trade negotiations if the Soviets conducted further offensives against Poland. These threats were ignored.

The threatened general strike was a convenient excuse for Lloyd George to back out of his commitments. On [[August 6]], 1920, the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] published a pamphlet stating that British workers would never take part in the war as Poland's allies, and labour unions blocked supplies to the British expeditionary force assisting Russian Whites in [[Arkhangelsk]]. French Socialists, in their newspaper ''[[L'Humanit<U+00E9>]]'', declared: "Not a man, not a [[sou]], not a shell for reactionary and capitalist Poland. Long live the Russian Revolution! Long live the Workmen's International!" Poland also suffered setbacks due to sabotage and delays in deliveries of war supplies, when workers in Austria, Czechoslovakia and Germany refused to transit such materials to Poland.<ref name="Cienciala"/>

[[Lithuania]]'s stance was mostly anti-Polish and the country had joined the Soviet side in July 1919. The decision was dictated by a desire to incorporate the city of [[Wilno]] (in Lithuanian, Vilnius) and nearby areas into Lithuania and, to a lesser extent, Soviet diplomatic pressure, backed by the threat of the Red Army stationed on Lithuania's borders.<ref name="Lawrynowicz"/> 

Polish allies were few. [[France]], continuing her policy of countering Bolshevism now that the Whites in Russia proper had been almost completely defeated, sent a 400-strong [[French Military Mission to Poland|advisory group to Poland's aid]] in 1919. It was mostly comprised of French officers, although it also included [[British Military Mission to Poland|a few British advisers]] led by Lieutenant General Sir [[Adrian Carton De Wiart]]. The French officers included a future President of France, [[Charles de Gaulle]]; during the war he won Poland's highest military decoration, the [[Virtuti Militari]]. In addition to the Allied advisors, France also facilitated the transit to Poland from France of the "[[Blue Army]]" in 1919: troops mostly of Polish origin, plus some international volunteers, formerly under French command in World War I. The army was commanded by the Polish general, [[J<U+00F3>zef Haller]]. [[Hungary]] offered to send a 30,000 cavalry corps to Poland's aid, but the Czechoslovakian government refused to allow them through; some trains with weapon supplies from Hungary did, however, arrive in Poland.

In mid-1920, the Allied Mission was expanded by some advisers (becoming the [[Interallied Mission to Poland]]). They included: French diplomat, [[Jean Jules Jusserand]]; [[Maxime Weygand]], chief of staff to Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]], Supreme Commander of the victorious Entente; and British diplomat, Lord [[Edgar Vincent D'Abernon]]. The newest members of the mission achieved little; indeed, the crucial Battle of Warsaw was fought and won by the Poles before the mission could return and make its report. Nonetheless for many years, a [[mythology|myth]] persisted that it was the timely arrival of Allied forces that had saved Poland, a myth in which Weygand occupied the central role.<ref name="Cienciala"/><ref name="Szczep">{{pl icon}}[[Janusz Szczepa<U+0144>ski]], [http://www.mowiawieki.pl/artykul.html?id_artykul=404 KONTROWERSJE WOK<U+00D3><U+0141> BITWY WARSZAWSKIEJ 1920 ROKU] (Controversies surrounding the Battle of Warsaw in 1920).

On [[August 10]], 1920, Russian [[Cossack]] units under the command of [[Gay Dimitrievich Gay]] crossed the [[Vistula]] river, planning to take Warsaw from the west while the main attack came from the east. On [[August 13]], an initial Russian attack was repulsed. The Polish 1st Army resisted a direct [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|assault on Warsaw]] as well as stopping the [[battle of Radzymin|assault at Radzymin]].<ref name="PWN:wojna"/>

The Soviet [[commander-in-chief]], [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], felt certain that all was going according to his plan.

On the other hand, south of Warsaw, where the fate of the war was about to be decided, Tukhachevski had left only token forces to guard the vital link between the Russian northwest and southwest fronts. Another factor that influenced the outcome of the war was the effective neutralization of Budionny's 1st Cavalry Army, much feared by Pi<U+0142>sudski and other Polish commanders, in the [[Battle of Lw<U+00F3>w (1920)|battles around Lw<U+00F3>w]]. The Soviet High Command, at Tukhachevski's insistence, had ordered the 1st Cavalry Army to march north toward Warsaw and [[Lublin]], but Budionny disobeyed the order due to a grudge between Tukhachevski and [[Aleksandr Yegorov|Yegorov]], commander of the southwest front.

The Polish 5th Army under General [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Sikorski]] counterattacked on [[August 14]] from the area of the [[Modlin fortress]], crossing the [[Wkra]] River. It faced the combined forces of the numerically and materially superior Soviet 3rd and 15th Armies. In one day the Soviet advance toward Warsaw and [[Modlin]] had been halted and soon turned into retreat. Sikorski's 5th Army pushed the exhausted Soviet formations away from Warsaw in a lightning operation. Polish forces advanced at a speed of thirty kilometers a day, soon destroying any Soviet hopes for completing their enveloping manoeuvre in the north. By [[August 16]], the Polish counteroffensive had been fully joined by Marshal Pi<U+0142>sudski's "Reserve Army." Precisely executing his plan, the Polish force, advancing from the south, found a huge gap between the Russian fronts and exploited the weakness of the Soviet "Mozyr Group" that was supposed to protect the weak link between the Soviet fronts. The Poles continued their northward offensive with two armies following and destroying the surprised enemy. They reached the rear of Tukhachevski's forces, the majority of which were encircled by [[August 18]]. Only that same day did Tukhachevski, at his [[Minsk]] headquarters 300 miles east of Warsaw, become fully aware of the proportions of the Soviet defeat and ordered the remnants of his forces to retreat and regroup. He hoped to straighten his front line, halt the Polish attack, and regain the initiative, but the orders either arrived too late or failed to arrive at all.<ref name="Lawrynowicz"/>

The Soviet armies in the center of the front fell into chaos. Tukhachevski ordered a general retreat toward the [[Bug River]], but by then he had lost contact with most of his forces near Warsaw, and all the Bolshevik plans had been thrown into disarray by communication failures.<ref name="Lawrynowicz"/>

The Bolshevik armies retreated in a disorganised fashion; entire divisions panicking and disintegrating. The Red Army's defeat was so great and unexpected that, at the instigation of Pi<U+0142>sudski's detractors, the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]] is often referred to in Poland as the "[[Miracle at the Vistula]]". Previously unknown documents from Polish Central Military Archive found in [[2004]] proved that successful breaking of Red Army radio communications [[cipher]]s by Polish cryptographers played great role in the victory<ref>Grzegorz Nowik, "Zanim z<U+0142>amano Enigm<U+0119>.

Moving through weakly defended areas, Budyonny's cavalry reached the city of [[Zamo<U+015B><U+0107>]] on [[29 August]] and attempted to take it in the [[battle of Zamo<U+015B><U+0107>]];<ref name="PWN:wojna"/> however, he soon faced an increasing number of Polish units diverted from the successful Warsaw counteroffensive. On [[August 31]], Budyonny's cavalry finally broke off its siege of Lw<U+00F3>w and attempted to come to the aid of Russian forces retreating from Warsaw. The Russian forces were intercepted and defeated by [[Polish cavalry]] at the [[Battle of Komar<U+00F3>w]] near Zamo<U+015B><U+0107>, the greatest cavalry battle since 1813 and one of the last cavalry battles in history. Although Budionny's Army managed to avoid encirclement, it suffered heavy losses and its morale plummeted.<ref name="PWN:wojna"/> The remains of Budionny's 1st Cavalry Army retreated towards [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]] on [[6 September]]<ref name="PWN:wojna"/> and was defeated shortly thereafter at the [[Battle of Hrubiesz<U+00F3>w]].

Tukhachevski managed to reorganize the eastward-retreating forces and in September established a new defensive line running from the Polish-Lithuanian border to the north to the area of [[Polesie]], with the central point in the city of [[Grodno]] in Belarus. In order to break this line, the Polish Army had to fight the [[Battle of the Niemen River]]. Polish forces crossed the Niemen River and outflanked the Bolshevik forces, which were forced to retreat again.<ref name="PWN:wojna"/> Polish forces continued to advance east on all fronts,<ref name="PWN:wojna"/> repeating their successes from the previous year. After the early October [[Battle of the Szczara River]], the Polish Army had reached the [[Ternopil]]-[[Dubno]]-[[Minsk]]-[[Drisa]] line.

In the south, Petliura's Ukrainian forces defeated the Bolshevik 14th Army and on September 18th took control of the left bank of the [[Zbruch]] river. During the next month they moved east to the line Yaruha on the [[Dniester]]-Sharharod-[[Bar, Ukraine|Bar]]-Lityn.<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite book| author=Kubijovic, V. | title=Ukraine: A Consice Encyclopedia| location= Toronto | publisher= University of Toronto Press | year = 1963| }}</ref>

==== Conclusion ====
Soon after the Battle of Warsaw the Bolsheviks sued for peace. The Poles, exhausted, constantly pressured by the Western governments and the [[League of Nations]], and with its army controlling the majority of the disputed territories, were willing to negotiate. The Soviets made two offers: one on 21 September and the other on 28 September. The Polish delegation made a counteroffer on 2 October. On the 5th, the Soviets offered amendments to the Polish offer which Poland accepted. The [[armistice]] between Poland on one side and Soviet Ukraine and Soviet Russia on the other was signed on 12 October and went into effect on 18 October.<ref name="PWN:wojna"/> Long negotiations of the peace treaty ensued.

Meanwhile, Petliura's Ukrainian forces, which now numbered 23,000 soldiers and which controlled territories immediately to the east of Poland, planned an offensive in Ukraine for November 11 but were attacked by the Bolsheviks on November 10. By November 21, after several battles, they were driven into Polish-controlled territory.<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite book| author=Kubijovic, V. | title=Ukraine: A Consice Encyclopedia| location= Toronto | publisher= University of Toronto Press | year = 1963| }}</ref>

According to the British historian [[A.J.P. Taylor]], the Polish-Soviet War "largely determined the course of European history for the next twenty years or more. [<U+2026>] Unavowedly and almost unconsciously, Soviet leaders abandoned the cause of international revolution." It would be twenty years before the Bolsheviks would send their armies abroad to 'make revolution'.<ref name="Suny" /><ref name="Davies_WERS-ix">[[Norman Davies|Davies, Norman]], ''White Eagle, Red Star: the Polish-Soviet War, 1919<U+2013>20'', Pimlico, 2003, ISBN 0-7126-0694-7.

After the peace negotiations Poland did not maintain all the territories it had controlled at the end of hostilities. Due to their losses in and after the Battle of Warsaw, the Soviets offered the Polish peace delegation substantial territorial concessions in the contested borderland areas, closely resembling the border between the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] before the first [[partitions of Poland|partition]] of 1772.<ref name="Davies_GP_2">[[Norman Davies]], ''[[God's Playground]].

Military strategy in the Polish-Soviet War influenced [[Charles de Gaulle]], then an instructor with the Polish Army who fought in several of the battles. He and [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Sikorski]] were the only military officers who, based on their experiences of this war, correctly predicted how the next one would be fought. Although they failed in the [[interbellum]] to convince their respective militaries to heed those lessons, early in [[World War II]] they rose to command of their armed forces in exile. The Polish-Soviet War also influenced Polish military doctrine, which for the next 20 years would place emphasis on the mobility of elite cavalry units.<ref name="Cienciala"/>

Until 1989, while communists held power in a [[People's Republic of Poland]], the Polish-Soviet War was omitted or minimized in Polish and other [[Soviet bloc]] countries' history books, or was presented as foreign intervention during the [[Russian Civil War]] to fit in with communist ideology.<ref name="Ferro">[[Marc Ferro]], ''The Use and Abuse of History: Or How the Past Is Taught to Children'', Routledge, 2004, ISBN 0-415-28592-5, [http://books.google.com/books?id=hDkeOWop9TsC&pg=PA262&lpg=PA262&sig=gJ_rvqbpe1H7D8Qkf5aV-3ahstY Google Print, p.262]</ref>
