The '''<U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line''' ({{lang-no|<U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rdbanen}}) is a closed, but not abandoned, [[railway line]] between [[Ganddal]] and [[<U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd]] in [[Rogaland]], [[Norway]]. The {{convert|12.24|km|adj=on}} line was built as a [[narrow gauge]] [[branch line]] of the [[J<U+00E6>ren Line]] by the [[Norwegian State Railways]] (NSB) and opened in 1924. It runs through the villages of [[Foss-Eikeland]] and [[Figgjo]] in [[Sandnes]] to <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd in [[Gjesdal]]. Several proposals were made for the <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line to become the first part of the main line from [[Stavanger]] to [[Oslo]], but instead the [[S<U+00F8>rland Line]] was connected to the J<U+00E6>ren Line in 1944. At the same time, the <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line was upgraded to [[standard gauge]].

The line had up to ten daily round trips with [[diesel multiple unit]]s, until passenger traffic was terminated in 1955. Freight traffic remained until 1988, when most of the line was abandoned in 1988, although {{convert|3|km|sp=us|0}} was used until 2001. The line is owned by the [[Norwegian National Rail Administration]]. The station at [[Figgjo]] has been converted to a museum, and the {{convert|3|km|sp=us|adj=on|0}} section from there to <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd is used for recreational [[draisine]]s. There have been proposals to reopen the line either as part of the [[J<U+00E6>ren Commuter Rail]] or the planned [[light rail]] for [[Greater Stavanger]].

==Route==
The <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line runs {{convert|12.24|km|sp=us}} from Ganddal to <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd.<ref name=a227>Aspenberg (1994): 227</ref> The whole line was built with NSB's standard for main lines, with a maximum gradient of 1.5% and minimum curve radius of {{convert|300|m}}.<ref name=t12>Thime (1999): 12</ref> It branches off from the S<U+00F8>rland Line (previously the J<U+00E6>ren Line) north of [[Ganddal Station]], {{convert|18|km|sp=us}} south of Stavanger. When the line opened, Ganddal Station was located south of the creek Stokkelandselven, but it was moved further north in 1935 to simplify operations.<ref name=t23>Thime (1999): 23</ref> The line continues over Stokkelandsevlen on a {{convert|7.5|m|sp=us|adj=on}} long bridge, and follows the creek until it reaches Foss-Eikeland, {{convert|3.43|km}} from Ganddal.<ref name=t12 /> Foss-Eikeland had a {{convert|91|m|sp=us|adj=on}} long [[passing loop]] and a {{convert|40|m|adj=on}} long [[railway platform|platform]]. The station building was built in wood, had a single story and was {{convert|57|m2}}.<ref >Thime (1999): 35</ref>

After Foss-Eikeland, the line crosses Figgjo River on a {{convert|30|m|adj=on}} long [[truss bridge]]. It passes Br<U+00E5>stein Station and continues up the steepest gradient at 1.5% to Figgjo Station.<ref name=t12 /> It had a {{convert|69|m|adj=on}} passing loop and a {{convert|50|m|adj=on}} long platform, and a {{convert|97|m2|sp=us|adj=on}} single-story station building in wood.<ref>Thime (1999): 62</ref> <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Station was the largest on the line, with two tracks and a {{convert|120|m|sp=us|adj=on}} long platform, a {{convert|12.3|m|sp=us|adj=on}} long [[turntable (rail)|turntable]] and a {{convert|66|m2|sp=us|adj=on}} depot. The station was built in wood in two stories, and included living quarters for the station master.<ref>Thime (1999): 76</ref>

The line eventually received additional stops, and in 1955, there were stations at Holane, Vagle, Foss-Eikeland, Kalberg, Br<U+00E5>stein, Figgjo Fajanse, Figgjo, Figgjo fabrikker and <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd. Some trains operated to Sandnes Station, whilst others continued all the way to [[Stavanger Station]].<ref name=history>{{cite web |url=http://www.aalgaardbanens-venner.com/?q=node/4 |title=Historien |author=Friends of the <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line |accessdate=21 April 2010 | language=Norwegian}}</ref>

As of 1994, the line was intact and operational from Ganddal to Foss-Eigeland and the cement factory there. Here, an internal crane track has been welded across the line. From Foss-Eigeland to Figgjo, the track is intact. At Figgjo, a bridge has been demolished, and it is not possible to traverse that section. Except for a number of [[level crossing]]s where the tracks have been asphalted over, the line remains intact to <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd. At <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Station the tracks have been removed, but the station building and depot remains. The station at Foss-Eigeland has been converted to a church, while the station at Figgjo had been taken over by a wholesaler.<ref>Aspenberg (1994): 231</ref> The line has officially been closed, but has not been abandoned. The [[Norwegian National Rail Administration]] retains ownership and can in the future renovate the line for operation.<ref name=onhold>{{cite web |title=Jernbaneverket vil beholde <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rdbanen |work=[[Stavanger Aftenblad]] |last=<U+00C5>dn<U+00F8>y |first=<U+00C5>smund |date=30 July 2008 |page=3 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:<U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd stasjon og kirke.jpg|thumb|left|<U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Station in 1924]]

The first plans to build a railway line along the route of the <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line was as part of the main route between Stavanger and Oslo. In 1873, County Engineer Th. Sejersted proposed a line running through [[H<U+00F8>gsfjord]], [[Dirdal]], [[Hunnedalen]], [[Sirdal]] and [[Hylestad]] and onwards through [[Telemark]] to [[Kongsberg]]. Through Rogaland, it would run further east than the [[J<U+00E6>ren Line]], which was under construction from Stavanger to Egersund. When the plans for a [[S<U+00F8>rland Line]], which would connect Stavanger to Oslo via [[Kristiansand]], started to be developed in 1892, some of Sjersted's plans were reconsidered.<ref>Thime (1999): 7</ref>

On 27 September 1894, a committee was established to plan a branch from the J<U+00E6>ren Line to <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd. The following year, the committee recommended that a line be built branching from [[Orstad]] in [[Klepp]], which would cost 348,000 [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK). Gjesdal Municipality offered NOK&nbsp;60,000 of the capital, on the basis that NSB would build and operate it. The state, on the other hand, wanted the line to be [[private railways of Norway|private]].<ref name=t8>Thime (1999): 8</ref>

A new committee was established in 1910, led by Mayor Sven Nilssen of Gjesdal, who was also director at <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rds Ullvarefabrikker. His company paid for traffic counting along the route, and the committee concluded that there was sufficient traffic to build a line. Two routes were proposed: one branching from [[Sandnes Station]] and one from Ganddal Station. The Ganddal alternative had lower investment costs, but would give higher operating costs; in 1913, investments were stipulated at NOKnbsp;787,800. Although NSB's board supported the line, construction was placed on hold.<ref name=t8 />

In 1919, local politicians proposed that the line be built administratively as part of the J<U+00E6>ren Line, but this was rejected by the government.<ref name=t8 /> Instead, the ministry wanted to again consider the <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line as part of the S<U+00F8>rland Line, and proposed that the <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line be built with standard gauge<U+2014>which would be used for the S<U+00F8>rland Line<U+2014>instead of the narrow gauge used by the J<U+00E6>ren Line. However, there would be no need for standard gauge until the S<U+00F8>rland Line was extended to Rogaland, so the line was planned to be built with narrow gauge track, but all other installations would be prepared for standard gauge.<ref name=t9>Thime (1999): 9</ref>

[[File:Ganddal stasjon2.jpg|thumb|[[Ganddal Station]], where the <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line branches off from the [[S<U+00F8>rland Line]]]]
Siting of the <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line from Ganddal to <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd started in 1920. The final cost estimate was NOK&nbsp;2.82 million and the plan was passed by parliament on 20 July 1921 and construction commenced on 21 December.<ref>Thime (1999): 12</ref> The construction was organized by Just Broch and led by Olaf Bakke.<ref name=t13>Thime (1999): 13</ref> Between 200 and 250 people worked on the line during construction. Because of the [[depression of 1920<U+2013>21|recession]], the railway works were seen as way to create jobs. Most of the workers came from Stavanger and nearly all had families to support.<ref>Thime (1999): 14</ref> The first train to operate on the line went from Stavanger on 20 December 1924, with the official opening by [[Minister of Transport and Communications (Norway)|Minister of Labour]] [[Lars Oftedal]] taking place when it reached <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd.<ref name=t13 /> The line became the last state-owned railway in Norway to be opened with narrow gauge.<ref name=a227 />

At the start, there were one or two daily round trips with [[steam locomotive]]-hauled trains.<ref name=a228>Aspenberg (1994): 228</ref> In the first year of operation, the line transported 18,500 passengers. The initial ticket price from Sandnes to <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd was NOK&nbsp;1.50, compared to NOK&nbsp;1 for a bus ticket. This was in part because NSB operated with a standard price based on the length of the line, and the line was longer than the corresponding roads. After a while the NSB board accepted that tickets be priced as if they were the length of the road, and the price was reduced to NOK&nbsp;1.10. Because of competition from truck drivers picking up random passengers for NOK&nbsp;0.75, the price was then reduced to NOK&nbsp;0.80 in 1927. The line made a profit during until the late 1940s, after which it started to operate with a deficit. In 1948<U+2013>49, the line transported 79,700 passengers.<ref name=t15>Thime (1999): 15</ref>

In 1923, the [[Parliament of Norway]] voted for a plan for the S<U+00F8>rland Line to run via [[Bjerkreim]] instead of the city of Egersund, and then onwards via Gjesdal. This plan meant that the section from Ganddal to Stavanger would have [[dual gauge]]. During further planning, it became clear that the Gjesdal alternative, although {{convert|15|km}} shorter, had a greater elevation difference than that needed for connecting the S<U+00F8>rland Line to the J<U+00E6>ren Line. This changed the NSB board's and [[Rogaland County Municipality|Rogaland County Council]]'s opinion, and the J<U+00E6>ren alternative was chosen.<ref name=t9 /> The final decision to build via J<U+00E6>ren was made by parliament in 1937.<ref>Thime (1999): 11</ref>

An inter-municipal railway committee was established in 1941. Led by Sigval Bergesen, it considered the possibility of extending the <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Line towards Hunnedalen via [[Setesdalsheiene]] to [[Lunde, Telemark|Lunde]] in Telemark. The line would be built with a higher standard than the S<U+00F8>rland Line and have a shorter route, allowing travel time from Stavanger to Oslo to be reduced to four to five hours. A detailed plan was made for the extension from <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd to the county border with Telemark. To consider the proposal, parliament established a committee in 1949 to look at the various proposals. After considering the impact and value of the various railways that had been proposed in the 1940s, it recommended not building the Inner Trunk Line, as the expansion had been christened.<ref name=history />

[[File:<U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd Station.jpg|thumb|left|<U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd  Station, the terminus]]
In 1930, an [[NSB Class Cmb1]] diesel multiple unit was taken into use, and the number of daily trips increased to four. On days with heavy traffic, it hauled a trailer, which was normally stationed at [[Sandnes Station]].<ref name=a228 /> On 10 November 1935, the new Ganddal Station opened, simplifying the stopping at the station.<ref name=t23 /> During [[World War II]], the multiple units were disused, and instead the trains were hauled with steam locomotives. From 1 May 1944, the line was converted to standard gauge, and [[NSB Class 14]] multiple units were taken into use, running on [[wood gas]] until the end of the war. In 1945, there were four daily round trips, but at the start of 1946, the number of daily round trips increased to six, and from mid-1946, to ten. From 1947 to 1953, there were eight or nine daily round trips, and from 1953 ten. Class 14 was eventually replaced with [[NSB Class 86]] and [[NSB Class 87]] in 1953.<ref name=a228 /> By then, the driving time from <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd to Sandnes had been reduced from 38 to 25&nsbp;minutes.<ref name=t15 />

In the 1940s and 1950s, several companies started a competing bus service. There were accusations that the route was cross-subsidized and that [[price dumping]] was occurring along the route from Sandnes to <U+00C5>lg<U+00E5>rd.<ref name=history /> In the early 1950s, discussion started about closing the line, and on 1 November 1955, all passenger transport was terminated,<ref name=a230>Aspenberg (1994): 230</ref> after a decision in parliament on 26 May 1955.<ref>Thime (1999): 17</ref> This was the line with the most frequent passenger traffic in Norway to be closed.<ref name=a230 />

After it was decided that passenger transport on the railway was to be terminated, both NSB's [[Nettbuss|bus division]] and other private companies, particularly Sverre Hage's, wanted to have the [[concession (contract)|concession]] to operate the line. Both established a bus services with a frequency as if the other operator did not exist. At the peak of the conflict, NSB's operations were at one point stopped by the police, although in the end, the concession was granted to them. As a response, Haga applied for concession to operate passenger transport on the railway, but this was denied by the authorities. The transfer to bus operations increased the ticket prices and travel time.<ref name=history />

Freight trains to the various industrial companies along the line remained until the 1980s, when traffic sank drastically. From 1988, the line was closed from Foss-Eigeland, although the line from there to Ganddal was kept for use for a cement factory.<ref name=a230 /> Until 2001 only the three first kilometers of the line were used, for transport of concrete structures, but then the Norwegian National Rail Administration stopped all traffic on the line.<ref name=onhold />
