'''''Vandal Hearts''''' (<U+30F4><U+30A1><U+30F3><U+30C0><U+30EB><U+30CF><U+30FC><U+30C4>) is a [[Japan]]ese [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing]] [[video game]] by [[Konami]], developed by [[Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo#Konami structure|Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo]] for the [[Sony PlayStation]] and by [[Konami#Konami structure|Konami Computer Entertainment Nagoya]] for the [[Sega Saturn]]. The PlayStation version was distributed in [[Japan]], [[North America]], and [[Europe]]. The Saturn version was never released outside of [[Japan]].

It was among the first [[console role-playing game]]s to be released for the 32-bit systems. It was one of the earliest tactical role-playing games to be released in North America, and garnered a small [[cult following]]. The game proved popular enough to spawn a sequel, ''[[Vandal Hearts II]]'', exclusively for the PlayStation, as well as a planned title for the [[Nintendo DS]] [[handheld game console]].

== Story ==
Thousands of years ago, the holy man known to history as Toroah the Messiah traveled far and wide across the continent of Sostegaria, spreading his teachings throughout the land. After his death, his descendants and heirs assumed absolute political power over the region, forming the basis of the Holy Ashah Dynasty and ruling through a combination of religious doctrine and military power for millennia. The kings and queens of the Holy Ashah Dynasty, however, did not always rule wisely or justly, and, as time passed, the citizenry began to resent the power of their leaders.

Fifteen years ago, this growing discontent found its ultimate expression in the person of Arris the Sage, who united the disparate anti-royal factions throughout Sostegaria and shaped them into a powerful [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] army. Under the cunning leadership of Arris, this Liberation Army managed to outwit and outmaneuver the Royal Army, and finally smashed through to the palace of the Ashah Dynasty itself, and burnt it to the ground.

With the monarchy dissolved, the rebels establish a ruling council founded on the principles of [[democracy]] and [[popular sovereignty]]. From the ashes of the Holy Ashah Empire emerges the Republic of Ishtaria. The leaders of the revolution naturally assumed leadership positions within the new republic: all, that is, except for Arris himself, who suddenly disappeared and has not been seen of, nor heard of, ever since.

Today, the fledgling republic is in increasingly dire straits: the autocratic Minister of Defense, Hel Spites, and his elite [[anti-terrorism]] squad, the Crimson Guard, are using ever-increasing force to stamp out the last vestiges of resistance to Ishtarian rule, while they allow [[outlaw]]s to roam the countryside and [[pirates]] to sail the seas. Meanwhile, Ash Lambert and his colleagues at the third battalion of the Ishtarian Security Forces begin to suspect a conspiracy at the highest levels of government. Ash's attempts to draw attention to the situation, though, only draw the ire of the conspirators themselves, leaving only Ash and his allies to foil the their plans and restore order to the nation.

== Characters ==
===Playable===
* '''Ash Lambert''' (Hero) - The game<U+2019>s main protagonist, a man with a strong sense of justice. Ash's friend, Clive Beckett, supported him in the past and later made him a platoon leader of the Ishtarian Security Forces. Despite his position, Ash must struggle to maintain confidence under the stigma of being the son of a man who betrayed Arris. His Hero class is a special type of Knight that additionally learns healing and attack spells.
* '''Clint Picard''' (Knight/Armor) - Fellow member of the Security Forces. A somewhat reserved and quiet person, he is none the less a reliable friend. Events in his past have made him extremely cautious, especially when it comes to his comrades.
* '''Diego Renault''' (Archer/Hawknight) - A carefree member of the Security Forces who<U+2019>s outspoken personality greatly contrasts Clint<U+2019>s. He seems to have some sort of anxiety about the merchant town of Kerachi.
* '''Eleni Dunbar''' (Mage/Monk) - She was an orphan of the war. Eleni was found and adopted by General Magnus. When Magnus goes missing on the Island of Madness, Eleni, being a powerful mage despite her young age, decides to travel with Ash in order to find the current whereabouts of her father.
* '''Huxley Hobbes''' (Cleric/Monk) - Eleni<U+2019>s teacher, care taker and a humble old healer. When she decides to find her father, Huxley insists on accompanying the party as well, much to Diego<U+2019>s dismay.
* '''Kira Wulfstan''' (Archer/Hawknight) - A fierce fighter and mercenary for hire who saves the party from bandits while they battle on a collapsing bridge. She sometimes endanger herself unnecessarily in battle, seemingly without caring much for the consequences of her actions, something Clint berates her for. 
* '''Grog Drinkwater''' (Knight/Armor) - A master sailor. After his brother dissappeared during an incident with pirates, Grog lost all will to sail and decided to drown his problems and sorrows in wine. When Ash asks him to sail to the Island of Madness, Grog accepts, under the condition that Ash completes a task that seems nearly impossible.
* '''Dolan''' (Knight/Armor) - A sensible and responsible soldier under Magnus<U+2019> command who cares greatly for those under his command. When many of his men start slipping into madness, he frees what few remaining soldiers he has and flees to safety.
* '''Amon''' (Archer/Hawknight) - One of the soldiers under Dolan<U+2019>s command. Although a clever man he is also something of a pessimist. His exact relationship with Sara is somewhat ambiguous.
* '''Sara''' (Cleric/Monk) - A spirited soldier saved by Dolan. She<U+2019>s close with Amon, though she denies her feelings when other party members ask her about it.
* '''Zohar Abu Sa'id''' (Mage/Monk) - A mysterious wizard of legend who disappeared from history hundreds of years ago and is later found in another dimension.
* '''Darius''' (Archer/Hawknight) - A prisoner whom Clint encounters. He seems to have some connection with Huxley.

===Non-playable===
* '''Arris the Sage''' - During the Revolution, his cunning strategies would outsmart the Royal Army, and lead the Liberation Army to victory. Arris went missing soon afterwards, and hasn't been seen to the present day.
* '''Clive Beckett''' - Head of the Ishtarian Security Forces, and the only person who had faith in Ash when everyone else believed him to be the son of a traitor. Maybe he knows more of it than he's letting in on?
* '''Kane Spites''' - Head of the Crimson Guard, a position he was probably given as the son of the Defence Minister, Hel Spites. Kane sees Ash as his archrival, and hopes to cross swords with him one day.
* '''Magnus Dunbar''' - A national hero of Ishtaria, who was recently sent to Gillbaris Island on a top secret mission to find a special artefact. He never returned.
* '''Dolf Crowley''' - A mysterious man who's true aspirations are not clear. He sends Ash and his party to Gillbaris Island to find out what's happened to General Magnus.
* '''Hel Spites''' - A power hungry Defence Minister who uses the Crimson Guard to do his dirty work and expand the extent of his power. He is one of more corrupt members of the council and will stop at close to nothing to further his power and influence.
* '''Xeno Calimani''' - A dark wizard who's made some kind of deal with Dolf. He's a former student of Zohar's, and that was when he gained a desire for knowledge above everything else.
* '''Crimson Leaders''' - Special warriors who assist Kane in leading the Crimson Guard, each of whom have never been bested in personal combat. They include Sabina, Kurtz, Dallas and Lando.

== Gameplay ==
Battles are carried out on a series of grid maps made up of squares, which may include different heights such as steps and walls and squares not accessible like water, trees and buildings. Although the environment is [[3-D computer graphics|three dimensional]] the angles used make it appear similar  to an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] view. Every character participating in battle has a set number of squares that they can move, and one action (such as attacking, casting a [[Magic (gaming)|magic]] spell, or using an item) they can perform per turn. Once every friendly character has performed their actions for a turn, hostile characters take their turn. On every stage the player controlling the friendly characters goes first, and they can move their characters in any order they wish.

Many but not all stages are completed by killing all the enemy characters. Other stages have different win conditions, such as killing one particular enemy character, helping your characters escape a larger force, or killing certain enemies but saving others. On every stage the defeat of the player's leader character means failing the stage. Losing most other characters in the party does not cause defeat, just less points and gold. If a friendly character dies they are only gone from the current stage and can return in the next stage. On stages that include rescuing other characters, the death of these characters results in losing.

===Classes===
The game features a variety of characters who join the battle party throughout the course of the game. Every character fits into one of seven [[character class]]es: ''Swordsman'', ''Armor'', ''Archer'', ''Hawknight'', ''Monk'', ''Mage'' and ''Cleric''. The strengths of each class is determined through a hierarchy (similar to the [[hand game]] [[Rock, Paper, Scissors]]): melee fighters (such as Swordsmen and Armors) are most effective when fighting against Archers. Archers are most effective when fighting against airborne characters (such as Hawknights, or flying monsters). Hawknights are most effective when fighting against Swordsmen. The other three classes (Monks, Mages, and Clerics) are magic-users: the Monk pairs healing magic with average physical strength, where the Mage specializes in attack magic, and the Cleric specializes in healing magic. In addition, Mages are also most effective against Armor. Most magic-using classes have weak defensive capabilities when compared to other classes in the game and most attacking magic spells are stronger against heavily armored opponents.
