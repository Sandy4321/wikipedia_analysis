NY&nbsp;81 begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 145|NY&nbsp;145]] and Potter Hollow Road ([[New York State Route 910G|NY&nbsp;910G]]) in the hamlet of Cooksburg (of the town of [[Rensselaerville, New  York|Rennselaerville]]). NY&nbsp;81 proceeds eastward through Rennselaerville, as a two-lane rural roadway, paralleling and crossing some power lines. After turning to the southeast, NY&nbsp;81 crosses into [[Greene County, New York|Greene County]] town of [[Durham, New York|Durham]]. Entering the hamlet of Oak Hill, the route becomes a two-lane residential street, intersecting with the terminus of [[County Route 22 (Greene County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;22]] (CR&nbsp;22; Oak Hill Road). After CR&nbsp;22, NY&nbsp;81 bends eastward out of Oak Hill, intersecting with the northern terminus of [[County Route 27 (Greene County, New York)|CR&nbsp;27]]. Paralleling a nearby creek, [[County Route 67 (Greene County, New York)|CR&nbsp;67]] forks to the southeast, while NY&nbsp;81 continues on its right-of-way through Durham. NY&nbsp;81 bends northeastward, intersecting with the northern terminus of [[County Route 75 (Greene County, New York)|CR&nbsp;75]], where it turns eastward into the town of [[Greenville (town), New York|Greenville]]. In Greenville, NY&nbsp;81 is the main street, remaining a two-lane residential street. Intersecting with [[County Route 50 (Greene County, New York)|CR&nbsp;50]] (North Road).<ref name="bing">{{bing maps|url=http://binged.it/JcLIDD|title=Overview map of NY 81|accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref>

NY&nbsp;81 continues eastward through Greenville, returning to being a rural two-lane highway and entering the hamlet of West Greenville. A short distance eastward, NY&nbsp;81 enters the hamlet of Greenville, where it doubles as a residential-commercial street, where it crosses [[New York State Route 32|NY&nbsp;32]]. After NY&nbsp;32, the route forks to the southeast at an intersection with [[County Route 26 (Greene County, New York)|CR&nbsp;26]], which is quickly connected via [[County Route 26A (Greene County, New York)|CR&nbsp;26A]]. Gradually bending eastward through the town of Greenville, NY&nbsp;81 intersects with the northern terminus of [[County Route 41 (Greene County, New York)|CR&nbsp;41]] (Greenville Center Road). After CR&nbsp;41, NY&nbsp;81 bends to the southeast once again, winding past at an intersection with [[County Route 35 (Greene County, New York)|CR&nbsp;35]] (West Road), which terminates there. Making a dart eastward, NY&nbsp;81 turns to the southeast past the hamlet of Surprise, where the route becomes a rural two-lane roadway once again. Just after Surprise, NY&nbsp;81 enters the town of [[Coxsackie (town), New York|Coxsackie]], winding southeastward past an intersection with [[County Route 45 (Greene County, New York)|CR&nbsp;45]], entering the hamlet of Earlton. The route remains rural, crossing intersections with [[County Route 51 (Greene County, New York)|CR&nbsp;51]] and [[County Route 9 (Greene County, New York)|CR&nbsp;9]] (Old Plank Road), bending to the northeast. Intersecting with a former alignment of itself, NY&nbsp;81 turns eastward, intersecting with the eastern terminus of CR&nbsp;26.<ref name="bing" />

After CR&nbsp;26, NY&nbsp;81 crosses over the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 87|I-87]]) then parallels another former alignment of itself. Through Coxsackie, NY&nbsp;81 intersects with [[U.S. Route 9W|US&nbsp;9W]] in a small commercial strip. This serves as the eastern terminus of NY&nbsp;81, which continues eastward as [[New York State Route 385|NY&nbsp;385]] (Mansion Street).<ref name="bing" />
