'''John Lee''' (active 1850-1870) was a British painter, part of a group of Liverpool artists, influenced by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] style. Very little is known about Lee's life and only four paintings have been attributed to him with any certainty. He exhibited at the Liverpool Academy from 1859-67 and at the [[Royal Academy]] from 1863-67.
