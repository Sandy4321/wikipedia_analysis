Captain '''Colin Douglas Maud''' DSO* DSC* (21 January 1903 - 1980) was a [[Royal Navy]] officer who during World War II commanded the destroyers [[HMS Somali (F33)|''Somali'']] and [[HMS Icarus (D03)|''Icarus'']] and acted as  beachmaster of [[Juno beach]] at the [[Normandy landings|D-day landings]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Destroyer Captain |last=Hill |first=Roger |year=2004 |publisher=Periscope Publishing Ltd |isbn=1-904381-25-1 |pages=p. 213 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fYJioV_saO0C&pg=PA213&dq=%22Icarus%22+%2B%22colin+Maud%22&num=100&sig=HuzhU-R1TjA_p6OJDl6hgSdPmbg }}</ref> With a heavy black beard,<ref name="Aron1962"/> he "possessed the outward appearance of a latter-day buccaneer and was endowed with exceptional boldness and tenacity to go with it".<ref name="Dickens1974">{{cite book|author=Dickens, Peter |title=Narvik: battles in the fjords|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KGd1AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 March 2012|year=1974|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-0-87021-852-1|page=105}}</ref> His iconic blackthorn stick and dog Winnie provided an enduring image when portrayed by [[Kenneth More]] in the film ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]''. He was described as "one of the most popular officers in the British Navy".<ref name="Aron1962"/>

==Early life and education==
Maud was born on 21 January 1903 and educated at [[Edgeborough school]], [[Guildford]]<ref name=census>England and Wales census, 1911</ref> and [[Britannia Royal Naval College]]. 

==Royal Navy service==
===Early career===
Maud became a [[midshipman]] on 15 January 1921, and was appointed to {{HMS|Iron Duke|1912|2}} for 2 years.<ref name=NL>''Navy List'', British Admiralty, 1920 - 1956</ref> He was promoted to sub-lieutenant in 1924, and completed his Greenwich lieutenants' course and submarine courses before joining the submarine {{HMS|H26||2}} in 1925. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1925, and joined {{HMS|L25||2}} in April 1927. Between 1927 and 1931 he served in the destroyer {{HMS|Wallace|1918|2}} and the submarine {{HMS|L21||2}}. He became the commanding officer of the submarine {{HMS|H49||2}} in April 1932.<ref name=NL/>  He joined the [[V and W class destroyer|W-class destroyer]] {{HMS|Woolston|1918|2}} in 1932 and by October of the same year was second-in-command of the destroyer {{HMS|Achates|H12|2}}. He was promoted to lieutenant commander in 1933.<ref name=NL/>

===Destroyer command===
Between July 1935 and early 1937 he commanded the 1919-vintage destroyer {{HMS|Sardonyx|1919|2}}<ref name=NL/> before moving in May 1937 to the brand new destroyer ''Icarus'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/4412.html|title=Allied warships - HMS ''Icarus'' (D 03)|publisher=U-boat.net|accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref> which operated in the North Sea at the beginning of World War II.  On 29 November 1939, in company with the destroyers {{HMS|Kingston|F64|2}} and {{HMS|Kashmir|F12|2}}, ''Icarus'' depth charged and sank the [[German submarine U-35 (1936)|German submarine ''U-35'']].<ref name=uboat/>

On 3 March 1940, in company with ''Express'', ''Impulsive'' and ''Esk'', Maud's ''Icarus'' laid a minefield which claimed [[German submarine U-44 (1939)|''U-44'']] 10 days later.<ref name=uboat/> On 11 April 1940 ''Icarus'' captured the 8,514-ton German supply ship ''Alster'' and on 13 April took part in the [[Second Battle of Narvik]]. He received a clutch of awards during the summer of 1940: on 28 June 1940 the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=34885 |date=28 June 1940 |startpage=3999 |endpage= |supp=yes }}</ref> on 11 July 1940 a [[medal bar|bar]] to the same award, "for good services in the Royal Navy since the outbreak of War",<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=34893 |date=9 July 1940 |startpage=4257 |endpage= |supp=yes }}</ref> and on 16 August 1940 a [[mention in despatches]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=34925 |date=16 August 1940 |startpage=5068 |endpage= |supp=yes }}</ref> 

In early May 1941, Maud commanded ''Icarus'' during the [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|hunt for the ''Bismarck'']], escorting the battlecruiser {{HMS|Hood|51|2}} and the battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}}. Poor weather meant that the destroyers were unable to keep up with the capital ships, and when ''Hood'' had been sunk, ''Icarus'' joined in the search for survivors - of which there were only three.

As commanding officer of ''Icarus'', Maud participated in [[Operation Dynamo|the evacuation of Dunkirk]], in [[Operation Gauntlet|a raid on Spitzbergen]], in the [[Operation Pedestal|Malta convoys]], and in numerous Atlantic and Russian convoys. 

Maud took over as captain of the destroyer [[HMS Somali (F33)|''Somali'']] in September 1942 when her own captain, [[John Eaton (Royal Navy officer)|Jack Eaton]], was ill.  While covering the return of the Russian convoy [[Convoy PQ 18|PQ-18]], ''Somali'' was torpedoed by ''[[German submarine U-703|U-703]]'' on 20 September. She was hit in her engine room, and although taken under tow by {{HMS|Ashanti|F51|2}}, on 25 September heavy weather broke her back, and she sank. Maud was rescued by Leading Seaman William Goad, who dove into the freezing water with a rope, for which Goad was awarded the [[Albert Medal]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=35877 |date=22 January 1943 |startpage=493 |endpage= |supp=yes }}</ref>  Of the 102 men on board, only 35 were rescued. Maud had spent an hour in the Arctic water, and credited his survival to the fact that he had drunk a bottle of whisky after going overboard. As a result he ordered men under his command to carry a bottle of whisky, which proved to be a popular order.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ddnf.org.uk/about/ron_paterson.php|title=The Reverend Ron Paterson MBE (1916-2009)|publisher=The D-Day and Normandy Fellowship|accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref> On 1 December 1942 he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=35805 |date=27 November 1942 |startpage=5225 |endpage= |supp=yes }}</ref>

===Normandy beachmaster===
Appointed as principal beachmaster of [[Juno beach]] during the [[Normandy landings]] in the rank of acting captain, Maud was responsible for marshalling troops, supplies and equipment through the beach zone, for evacuating casualties and prisoners of war, and for salvaging wrecks and clearing beach obstacles. For conducting these difficult duties under fire, and for several weeks afterwards, he was awarded a [[Medal bar|bar]] to his Distinguished Service Order.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=36794 |date=10 November 1944 |startpage=5214 |endpage= |supp=yes }}</ref>

Eight days after the first landings, [[Charles de Gaulle]] and his entourage were met by Maud (who was incongruously wearing shorts) when they landed in France. While de Gaulle met [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Montgomery]], Maud drove [[Georges Thierry d'Argenlieu|Admiral d'Argenlieu]], [[Marie-Pierre K<U+0153>nig|General K<U+0153>nig]], [[Gaston Palewski]] and [[Claude Hettier de Boislambert|Colonel Boislambert]] to [[Bayeux]] in his jeep to prepare for de Gaulle's entrance to the city. The preparations included Maud driving round the streets of Bayeux carrying a [[French Resistance ]] leader shouting "General de Gaulle will speak at four o'clock on the Place du Chateau".<ref name="Aron1962">{{cite book|author=Aron, Robert |title=De Gaulle before Paris: the liberation of France, June-August, 1944|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F-UvAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 March 2012|year=1962|publisher=Putnam|pages=67-69}}</ref>

===Walcheren===
Maud was appointed as the deputy commander of the Flushing assault force during the [[Battle of Walcheren Causeway|Allied attack on Walcheren Island]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.combinedops.com/Walcheren.htm|title=Operation Infatuate - Walcheren 1 to 8 November 1944|publisher=Combined Operations|accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref> On 11 December 1945 he was [[mentioned in despatches]] "for distinguished service during the War in Europe".<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=37380 |date=7 December 1945 |startpage=5993 |endpage= |supp=yes }}</ref>

===Later career===
{{HMS|Cardigan Bay|K630|2}}, a new [[Bay-class frigate|Bay-class anti-aircraft frigate]], had been intended for the British Pacific Fleet. Maud commanded her from June 1945, taking her through her work up in Scotland, but when Japan surrendered, she was sent instead to the Mediterranean Fleet.  Maud left her there in October 1946<ref name=CBsoc>{{cite web |url=http://www.hmscardiganbayassociation.co.uk/Page3.html |title=The Med Fleet 1945-1948|publisher=HMS ''Cardigan Bay'' Association|accessdate=2012-03-27}}</ref> to take command of {{HMS|Berryhead|F18|2}}, a reserve depot ship in Plymouth. Maud was promoted to [[captain (naval)|captain]] on 30 June 1947.<ref name=uboat/> On 25 November 1947 he was granted permission to wear the order of a Commander of the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]], which had been bestowed by the Queen of the Netherlands in recognition of "services rendered to the Royal Netherlands Navy during the war".<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=38132 |date=21 November 1947 |startpage=5596 |endpage= |supp=yes }}</ref> From 1948 to 1949 he commanded {{HMS|Mull of Galloway|F26|2}} as Senior Officer, Reserve Forces, Clyde area.<ref name=NL/>  From April 1949 until May 1951 he was deputy to Rear Admiral [[James Wilfred Jefford|James Jefford]], serving as the second-in-command of the [[Pakistan Navy|Royal Pakistan Navy]].<ref name=NL/><ref name=obit>''[[The Times]]'' (London, England), Friday 16 May 1980; p.17; Issue 60626.
