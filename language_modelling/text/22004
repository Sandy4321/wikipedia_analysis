'''Herbert Armitage James''', [[Order of the Companions of Honour|C.H.]] (3 August 1844&nbsp;<U+2013> 15 November 1931) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] cleric and [[headmaster]] of three leading [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference|public schools]], who ended his "remarkable scholastic career", as it was later described by [[Austen Chamberlain]], by becoming President of [[St John's College, Oxford]]. After an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] education and early teaching career at [[Marlborough College]], he was headmaster of [[Rossall School]] from 1875 to 1886. It was said that he raised the school "to a pitch of all-round excellence which it had not known before". After suffering from health problems at Rossall, he served as [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[St Asaph's Cathedral|St Asaph]] from 1886 to 1889.  He returned to teaching in 1889, becoming headmaster of [[Cheltenham College]] and remaining in this post until 1895, despite being offered the position of headmaster of [[Clifton College]].  He then became headmaster of [[Rugby School]] and served there to great acclaim.  His Rugby School nickname of "The Bodger" is still in use at the school. He left Rugby School in 1909 to become President of St John's College, Oxford, a position he held until his death 22 years later.

He was a highly respected teacher and preacher, being described as one of the best preachers of his day.  He was widely praised for his work at Rossall, Cheltenham, Rugby and St John's. He was made a member of the [[Order of the Companions of Honour]] by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] in 1926. At a dinner in his honour held to mark this award, attended by over 200 friends and former students, he was described by Austen Chamberlain (the [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]]) as "one of the greatest and most forceful characters who had ever devoted himself to education". The [[Lord Chancellor]], [[George Cave, 1st Viscount Cave|Viscount Cave]], also spoke at the dinner to praise James's directness in his opinions and decisions, his weighty judgment, his high character and his kindly nature.

==Teaching career==
[[Image:1907 Penn Cricket Team v Rugby School.jpg|thumb|left|The [[University of Pennsylvania]] cricket team competing in a match against Rugby School in 1907, during James's time as headmaster.]]
He was Assistant Master at [[Marlborough College]] from 1872<U+2013>75 before being appointed [[Headmaster]] of [[Rossall School]] in 1875.<ref name="Obit"/> On the last day of his first year as headmaster, the whole school (with the exception of a couple of students) gathered outside the school to hiss and boo at James.<ref name=Rossall/>  Despite this, he held this position until 1886 and was regarded as having been "brilliantly successful, raising the school in the 11 years of his reign to a pitch of all-round excellence which it had not known before".<ref name="Obit"/> His students at Rossall included [[Henry Stuart-Jones]], who became a distinguished classical scholar.  One of Stuart-Jones's contemporaries later gave James the credit for making Stuart-Jones an "accurate and industrious scholar".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34232|title=Jones, Sir Henry Stuart- (1867<U+2013>1939)|first= H.

The strain of his position at Rossall School having affected his health, he was appointed [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[St Asaph's Cathedral|St Asaph]] in 1886.<ref name="Obit"/> In 1889, his health restored, he left St Asaph to become Principal of [[Cheltenham College]] (1889<U+2013>95).<ref name="Obit"/> He was again successful in this post, and was offered the position of Headmaster of [[Clifton College]], but was prevailed upon to stay.<ref name="Obit"/> He made participation in [[sport|games]] a compulsory part of the boys' education in 1889.<ref>{{cite book|title=Secondary Education in England, 1870-1902: Public Activity and Private Enterprise| last=Roach| first=John|year=1991|publisher=[[Routledge]]|accessdate=12 February 2008|page=131|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wDfV9KvZ4vgC&pg=PA131&dq=%22H+A+James%22+rugby+roach&ie=ISO-8859-1&sig=BdUzyT65acJ_nvMY6i-oHF2dF_M}}</ref>  He also started the building of a new chapel to mark the college's centenary in 1891.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://callisto.ggsrv.com/imgsrv/WrapPDF?banner=47b0ecfe&digest=cb57f6368c15e64ea6bccc8049058e48&contentSet=LT&recordID=0FFO-1896-OCT14-005-F|title=Ecclesiastical Intelligence|work=[[The Times]] ||date=14 October 1896|page=5|accessdate=12 February 2008}}</ref> When [[John Percival (bishop)|Dr Percival]] was appointed [[Bishop of Hereford]], James succeeded him in 1895 as Headmaster of [[Rugby School]].

He returned to Oxford in 1909 as President of [[St John's College]] (having been made an honorary fellow in 1895) and held this position until his death in 1931.<ref name="Obit"/>  He was regarded during this time as a leader for the causes of the church and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and was described as "winning all hearts with his geniality, his good sense, and his readiness to help all with whom he was brought into contact."<ref name="Obit"/> In 1918, during his time as college President, his photograph was taken for inclusion in the collection of the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?LinkID=mp76952| title=Herbert Armitage James (1844-1931), Headmaster of Rugby School | publisher=National Portrait Gallery |month=March|year=2008|accessdate=6 April 2008}}</ref>

He said that membership of the Companionship of Honour had been given only to a few who had rendered "special social service" to the country, and he rejoiced that James had been "enrolled" in this "select band".<ref name=Dinner/> He added that St John's College and Oxford University owed James a "debt of gratitude" for his "wise advice and guidance".<ref name=Dinner/> James, he said, "had never dealth in the fine shades, or in the analysis of tendencies, or the exploration of avenues. Whatever was right had to be done. Whatever was wrong he fought with all his might."<ref name=Dinner/>

Marlborough School paid tribute to James through a poem by [[Charles Larcom Graves]].  One stanza was later quoted in the obituary of James published by ''The Times'':<ref name="Obit"/>
{{cquote|''Unversed in any of the arts<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That aim at winning mass approval,<br />He found his way into our hearts<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From which he still defies removal.<br />He played our games; he gained our trust;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was both honoured and respected,<br />For he was vigorously just,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And absolutely unaffected.''}}

Chamberlain said that James had had a "remarkable scholastic career" and had exercised a "great and powerful influence" in the schools that he had served, leaving behind "a memory dear to all who had known him".  He said that James was regarded as "one of the greatest and most forceful characters who had ever devoted himself to education."<ref name=Dinner/>  The dinner itself was reported as a news item in ''[[The Times]]'' on the following day, with a list of the principal attendees and summaries of the main speeches, and of James's response, in which he said that he regarded the honour he had received as one bestowed on teaching.<ref name=Dinner/>
