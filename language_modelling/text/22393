[[Air Marshal (Australia)|Air Marshal]] '''Sir Colin Thomas Hannah''' [[Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]], [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order|KCVO]], [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Companion of the Order of the Bath|CB]] (22 December 1914{{spaced ndash}}22 May 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) and a [[Governor of Queensland]]. Born in [[Western Australia]], he was a member of the [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] before joining the RAAF in 1935. After graduating as a pilot, Hannah served in [[No. 22 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&nbsp;22]] and [[No. 23 Squadron RAAF|23 Squadrons]] from 1936 to 1939. During the early years of World War&nbsp;II, he was the RAAF's Deputy Director of Armament. He then saw action in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]] as commander of [[No. 6 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;6 Squadron]] and, later, [[No. 71 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;71 Wing]], operating [[Bristol Beaufort]] bombers. By 1944, he had risen to the rank of [[group captain]], and at the end of the war was in charge of Western Area Command in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]].

Hannah commanded [[RAAF Base Amberley|RAAF Station Amberley]], Queensland, in 1949&ndash;50, and saw service during the [[Malayan Emergency]] as senior air staff officer at [[Far East Air Force (Royal Air Force)|RAF Far East Air Force Headquarters]], Singapore, between 1956 and 1959. His other post-war appointments included [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]] from 1961 to 1965, [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) [[RAAF Air Command|Operational Command]] from 1965 to 1967, and AOC Support Command from 1967 to 1969. In January 1970, he was promoted to air marshal and became [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (CAS), the RAAF's senior position. [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|Knighted]] in 1971, Hannah concluded his three-year appointment as CAS a year early, in March 1972, to become Governor of Queensland. He attracted controversy in this role after making outspoken comments regarding the [[Government of Australia|Federal government]] of the day, and the British government refused to agree to his term being extended. Hannah retired in March 1977, and died the following year.

Born on 22 December 1914 in [[Menzies, Western Australia|Menzies]], Western Australia, Hannah was the son of Thomas Howard Hannah, a [[Civil service|public servant]] who later became a [[magistrate]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and his wife Johanna.

Hannah joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] on 15&nbsp;January 1935 as an air cadet at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|RAAF Station Point Cook]], Victoria. After graduating from [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 Flying Training School]] (No.&nbsp;1 FTS), he obtained his commission as a [[pilot officer]] in July 1936.<ref name="Dennis"/> His first posting was to [[No. 22 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;22 Squadron]] at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]], New South Wales.

Promoted to [[flight lieutenant]], Hannah was posted to Britain in July 1939 to undertake a [[Royal Air Force]] armaments training course, which he had barely begun when war was declared on 3&nbsp;September. He completed the course, and returned to Australia in March 1940. After brief postings to No.&nbsp;1 Armament School, Point Cook, and Station Headquarters Laverton, he was assigned to Air Force Headquarters, [[Melbourne]], in May. He was made an acting [[squadron leader]] in September 1940 and became Deputy Director of Armament the next year. In April 1942, Hannah was promoted to temporary [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]].<ref name="ADB"/> He undertook a general reconnaissance course the following May.<ref name="High Fliers"/>

In November 1943, Hannah was appointed commanding officer of [[No. 6 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;6 Squadron]] at [[Milne Bay]], Papua, flying [[Bristol Beaufort]] light bombers.<ref name="Dennis"/><ref>Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/06.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 99<U+2013>103]</ref> While on a familiarisation flight he came under [[friendly fire]] from [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]] on [[Kiriwina|Kiriwina Island]], but managed to avoid serious injury. He was raised to temporary [[group captain]] in December, and assumed command of [[No. 71 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;71 Wing]] the following month.<ref name="ADB"/> The Beauforts of No.&nbsp;6 Squadron and No.&nbsp;71 Wing took part in a series of [[Bombing of Rabaul (November 1943)|major attacks on Rabaul]], bombing and strafing airfields, infrastructure and shipping; this continued until February 1944, when the Japanese withdrew their aircraft from Rabaul.<ref>Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/06.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 93<U+2013>96]</ref><ref>Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/08.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 125<U+2013>133]</ref>  The same month, however, Hannah fell ill and had to be repatriated to Australia.

In December 1961, Hannah was appointed [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]], gaining promotion to acting [[air vice marshal]] in May 1962; the rank was made substantive in January 1963.<ref name="ADB"/> He was later described by his staff officer in this role as "brusque" and "impersonal" though not unsympathetic, his "uncommunicative" manner stemming from a preference to "do his own research, think out the substance of his project submissions, dictate to his stenographer, then amend to his own satisfaction", rather than delegate.<ref>Jacobs, ''Up and Away'', pp. 111<U+2013>112</ref> Hannah served as [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Operational Command (now [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]]) from February 1965 to December 1967, during which time the RAAF's fighter squadrons completed their conversion from the [[CAC Sabre]] to the supersonic [[Dassault Mirage III]].<ref name="ADB"/><ref>[http://www.airforce.gov.au/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series3/A3.htm Dassault Mirage III] at [[RAAF Museum]].

===Chief of the Air Staff===
Hannah was promoted to [[air marshal]] on 1&nbsp;January 1970, and succeeded Air Marshal [[Alister Murdoch|Sir Alister Murdoch]] as [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]].<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="Dennis"/> Murdoch had earlier recommended Hannah, known to be a strong advocate for [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Australian participation in the Vietnam War]], for the position of Commander Australian Forces Vietnam when it came up for rotation at the end of 1969. In the event, the post again went to an [[Australian Army|Army]] officer, and the Federal government ordered the withdrawal of the RAAF presence in Vietnam during Hannah's tour as CAS.<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 79<U+2013>80</ref> In March 1970, the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]], [[Malcolm Fraser]], commissioned a review of naval air power. Hannah fundamentally disagreed with any suggestion that the [[Royal Australian Navy]] should operate land-based aircraft, claiming that he was arguing not from a partisan perspective but to ensure that Australia's limited defence resources were not spread across three services. However, confidential RAAF papers from the time declared that its goal was always to "avoid giving the Navy the opportunity to establish a land-based air force".<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 312<U+2013>313</ref> Two years later, Hannah responded favourably to a recommendation from the [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee]], Admiral [[Victor Smith|Sir Victor Smith]], to use the soon-to-be-delivered [[General Dynamics F-111C|F-111 bomber]] for maritime support, among other roles.<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 392</ref>

In the 1971 New Year Honours, Hannah was raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE).<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=45263|supp=yes|startpage=34|date=31 December 1970|accessdate=on 22 November 2008}}</ref> His tour as CAS coincided with the RAAF's [[Golden Jubilee]], celebrated in March and April that year. He personally organised a fly-past of two [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] F-111s at [[air show]]s marking the occasion, generating favourable coverage to counteract the poor publicity surrounding the type's long-delayed entry into Australian service.<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 451</ref> However, he was also involved in two controversial decisions the same year. Firstly, he was a member of the committee to choose an [[Royal Australian Air Force Memorial|Air Force memorial]] to be located on [[ANZAC Parade, Canberra|ANZAC Parade]], Canberra. The selected design was an abstract sculpture that, according to official RAAF historian Alan Stephens, reflected "the selection panel's comprehensive failure to understand the nature of air force service".<ref name="Going Solo, pp. 452-453"/> Secondly, Hannah commissioned a replacement for the Air Force's winter uniform, traditionally a shade "somewhere between royal and navy blue" that had been personally chosen by the RAAF's first CAS, Wing Commander (later Air Marshal Sir) [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]], to distinguish it from the lighter Royal Air Force colour.<ref name="Going Solo, pp. 452-453"/> Hannah publicly debuted the uniform that he approved, an all-purpose middle-blue suit, at a Point Cook graduation parade on 8&nbsp;December 1971.<ref>Parnell; Boughton, ''Flypast'', p. 341</ref><ref name="RAAF">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 305</ref> It was the object of much adverse comment in the ensuing years; personnel complained of being mistaken for bus, train and postal employees. One of Hannah's successors as CAS, Air Marshal [[Errol McCormack]], ordered that the uniform revert to Williams' original colour and style commencing in 2000.<ref name="RAAF"/>

Hannah's planned three-year term as Chief of the Air Staff was cut short by some ten months when he accepted an offer to serve as [[Governor of Queensland]], becoming the first officer in the RAAF to receive a [[Viceroy|vice-regal]] appointment.

His term was relatively uneventful until 1975.
