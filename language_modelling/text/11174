==Early life==
John Coleman Herbst was born in 1909 in [[San Diego County, California]], in the rural [[San Diego North County, California]]|North County]] near [[Palomar Mountain]], an area he described as "Rancho Palomar".<ref name=CBIRoundupFebruary1945/> He was married in the 1930s and fathered a son named Tommy in 1933.<ref name=CBIRoundupFebruary1945>''CBI Roundup'', Volume 3, Number 3, February 23, 1945. [http://cbi-theater-1.home.comcast.net/~cbi-theater-1/china_command_post/command_post_022345.html "&nbsp;'Pappy,' Fighter Ace, Promoted."] Retrieved on November 18, 2009.</ref>

==World War II==
In 1941, Herbst was working as a tax consultant for an American oil company when he left civilian life and joined the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) to learn to fly fighters in combat.<ref name=Stanaway67/> After training, Herbst was posted to the [[United Kingdom]]. Some said Herbst scored against a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]].<ref name=Stanaway67/><ref name=CBIRoundupFebruary1945/> In early 1942, Herbst returned to the U.S. and joined the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) as a flight instructor on the [[Florida]] coast, where a recuperating [[David Lee "Tex" Hill]] witnessed his flying skill and fingered Herbst as an excellent candidate for [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|CBI Theater]] combat pilot.<ref name=Stanaway68>Stanaway, 1999, p. 68.</ref>

In 1944 upon his arrival in the CBI Theater, Herbst acquired the nickname "Pappy" because of his much greater age (34) relative to the other pilots.<ref name=Stanaway67/> A [[swastika]] was painted on his personal fighter aircraft in China, acknowledging his stated German kill without attempting to claim it through official U.S. channels.<ref name=CBIRoundupFebruary1945/> He named his aircraft "Tommy's Dad" in honor of his son. Herbst initially served with the 5th Fighter Group (provisional) without scoring any aerial victories but was transferred to the 76th Fighter Squadron on May 30, 1944.<ref name=Stanaway68/> While flying a [[P-51 Mustang|P-51B Mustang]] gathering weather data north of Kiatow on June 17, 1944, Herbst shot down a lone [[Nakajima Ki-43]] fighter to make his first USAAF kill.<ref name=Stanaway68/>

Nine days later on June 26, 1944, Herbst was made commander of the [[74th Fighter Squadron]], a position he held until February 1945.<ref>Molesworth, 2009, p. 120.</ref> Herbst transitioned to [[P-40 Warhawk|P-40N-20 Warhawks]] as flown by the 74th and soon prevailed again in combat. On August 6 near Hengyang flying against Nakajima Ki-43s, he scored his fourth USAAF aerial victory to become an ace, including the one RCAF victory.<ref>Molesworth, 2009, p. 95.</ref> In September, the 74th transitioned to [[P-51 Mustang]]s. The 74th FS transitioned to P-51C-7 Mustangs in August, and on September 3 Herbst shot down two Japanese aircraft that he reported as [[Aichi D3A]] "Val" dive bombers but were probably [[Mitsubishi Ki-51]] "Sonia" models instead.<ref name=Stanaway68/> These were the first P-51 victories of the 74th FS.<ref name=Stanaway68/> By September 16, Herbst's USAAF tally reached nine victories, five in a Mustang.<ref name=Stanaway68/>

After racking up 18 victories over Japanese aircraft, Herbst was promoted to lieutenant colonel in February 1945.<ref name=CBIRoundupFebruary1945/>

==Postwar==
In August 1945, Herbst teamed with Major Carl T. Sigman to write an article for ''[[Popular Science]]'' entitled "How Planes Fight the 'White Devil' of the Air", an explanation of the dangers of ice on aircraft, and how it is countered.<ref>Herbst, Major John C. and Major Carl T. Sigman. ''Popular Science'' Volume 147, Number 2, August 1945. [http://books.google.com/books?id=GSEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA114 "How Planes Fight the 'White Devil' of the Air", p. 114.] ISSN 0161-7370. Retrieved on November 18, 2009.</ref>

On November 9, 1945, Herbst became the commander of 445 Flight Test Squadron.<ref>Air Force Historical Research Agency. [http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=10765 445 Flight Test Squadron.] Retrieved on November 18, 2009.</ref>

In April 1946, Herbst and [[Robin Olds]] formed what a jet [[aerobatics]] demonstration team, flying the [[Lockheed]] [[P-80 Shooting Star]]. The two pilots performed a coordinated routine that thrilled the crowds at every stop, including an appearance at Washington, D.C.<ref name=Sherwood>Sherwood, John Darrell. ''Fast Movers: Jet Pilots and the Vietnam Experience'', pp. 10<U+2013>11. Simon and Schuster, 2001. ISBN 0743206363</ref>

Herbst married for the second time on July 3, 1946, to Jeanne Eve Murphy, an actress.<ref name=Billboard/>

==Death and legacy==
Herbst was mortally wounded at the age of 36 in front of 30,000 people at the [[San Diego County Fair]] on July 4, 1946 when his [[P-80 Shooting Star]] jet crashed after failing to pull up in a dive just west of the [[Del Mar Fairgrounds]]. Herbst's second wife of less than 24 hours witnessed the accident,<ref name=Billboard>''The Billboard'', Vol. 58, No. 28, July 13, 1946.

Both rushed to aid in the rescue,<ref name=Welch>Welch, Diane Y., and B. Paul Welch, 22nd District Agricultural Association.
