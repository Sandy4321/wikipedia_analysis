"'''White Horse'''" is a [[country music]] song performed by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. The song was written by Swift and [[Liz Rose]] and produced by [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]], with Swift's aid. The song was released on December 8, 2008 by [[Big Machine Records]], as the second [[single (music)|single]] from Swift's second studio album ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]''. Swift and Rose composed the song about one of Swift's ex-boyfriends, when Swift discovered he was not what she had perceived of him. It focused on the moment where Swift accepted the relationship was over. "White Horse" is, musically, a [[country pop]] song and uses sparse production to emphasize vocals. Lyrically, the track speaks of disillusionment and pain in a relationship, drawing references to [[fairytale]]s.

Critically, "White Horse" garnered generally positive reception. At the [[52nd Grammy Awards]], "White Horse" won the Grammy Awards for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song|Best Country Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance|Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]. The song also performed well commercially, although it did not duplicate the success of its predecessor, "[[Love Story (Taylor Swift song)|Love Story]]". In the United States, it peaked at number thirteen in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number two on [[Hot Country Songs]]. It was later certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The song's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by [[Trey Fanjoy]], who directed all of Swift's prior videos. The video features Swift as she decides to end a relationship via phone call. In the video, Swift recalls multiple memories with her love interest, both positive and negative. Swift promoted "White Horse" via live performances, including numerous during the [[Fearless Tour]] (2009<U+2013>10).

==Background==
Swift commenced composing "White Horse" almost a year before the release of ''Fearless'',<ref name="onsetwhitehorse">{{cite episode|title=On the Set Behind the Scenes 'White Horse'|minutes=22:00|series=Taylor Swift: On the Set|network=Great American Country|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> weeks after composing ''Fearless''{{'s}} lead single "[[Love Story (Taylor Swift song)|Love Story]]", songs which are quite disparate lyrically. Swift first solely wrote the first verse. She then made a phone call to [[Liz Rose]], co-writer of most tracks on Swift's eponymous debut studio album, ''[[Taylor Swift (album)|Taylor Swift]]'' (2006), asking for her aid in finishing the song; the two completed writing the song in approximately forty-five minutes.<ref name="cw">{{cite journal|last=Conaway|first=Alanna|date=June 1, 2009|title=Story Behind the Song: Love Story<U+2014>Chapter 2|journal=[[Country Weekly]]|volume=16|issue=16|pages=21|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> The song was inspired by a [[boyfriend]] of Swift's who she perceived to be a [[Prince Charming]] and, in the downfall of the relationship, then realized he was not.<ref name="onsetwhitehorse" /> She said he was the person who triggered the song, but, once in the midst of writing it, drifted in direction.<ref name="videoreplay">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/videos/misc/339966/video-replay-taylor-swift-white-horse.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift : Video Replay: Taylor Swift - White Horse|work=[[CMT]]|publisher=[[Viacom]]|accessdate=March 15, 2011}}</ref> It focused on the initial moment where she recognized the relationship was over. She said everything after that particular moment centered around recuperation and, because of that, considered it the most solemn aspect of a breakup: "To me, 'White Horse' is about what, in my opinion, is the most heart-breaking part of a break-up <U+2013> that moment when you realize that all the dreams you had, all those visions you had of being with this person, all that disappears."<ref name="cutbycut">{{cite web|url=http://www.bigmachinerecords.com/taylorswift/index.cfm?id=110|title=Cut By But|first=Taylor|last=Swift|authorlink=Taylor Swift|work=''Bigmachinerecords.com''|publisher=[[Big Machine Records]]|accessdate=March 12, 2010|archivedate=July 27, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rXkDwe4d}}</ref> About the difference in themes between "White Horse" and "Love Story", Swift explained that in divergent scenarios, she regarded [[fairytale]]s in different manners. She attributed the fact that because she did not expect to go through the event, then she became more inclined to come in terms with reality.<ref name="cmtfairytale">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1599049/taylor-swifts-fascination-with-fairy-tales-comes-through-on-new-album.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift's fascination with Fairy Tales comes through on new album|first=Lindsey|last=Roznovsky|date=November 10, 2008|work=''[[CMT News]]''|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=February 13, 2011}}</ref>

The song was not originally intended to be included on ''Fearless'', due to Swift believing solemness was already represented accurately on the album; therefore, Swift was planning on including the track on her third studio album, what would become ''[[Speak Now]]'' in 2010.<ref name="cutbycut" /> However, when Swift's Los Angeles [[Talent manager|managing agency]] set up an appointment with the executive producers of her favorite television series, ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', [[Betsy Beers]] and [[Shonda Rhimes]], they discussed including Swift's music on the series. Swift chose to play them "White Horse" live with an [[acoustic guitar]].<ref name="cutbycut" /> Beers and Rhimes were very impressed and told Swift they would respond her via telephone as soon as they could. Swift decided to not include the track on ''Fearless'', until the producers responded, which they did not for some time. When ''Grey's Anatomy''{{'}}s representatives called, Swift and [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]] recorded the song immediately, sent a CD to them, and they decided to use it on the television series.<ref name="cutbycut" /> "White Horse" debuted on the [[Grey's Anatomy|fifth season]] premiere of ''Grey's Anatomy'', "[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]", on September 25, 2008.<ref name="grey">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1595321/taylor-swift-lands-song-on-greys-anatomy-premiere.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift Lands Song on Grey's Anatomy Premiere|date=September 22, 2008|work=''CMT News''|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=March 14, 2011}}</ref>

The lyrics of "White Horse" are written in [[first person narrative|first person]], with Swift reflecting on an occasion when a relationship, which seemed like a fairytale in the commence, fell apart: "I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale/ I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet/ Lead her up the stairwell."<ref name="billboardreview" /><ref name="topabout" /> The track spoke about pain and disillusionment,<ref name="billboardreview" /> in the clear perspective of a reborn realist.<ref name="villagevoice" /> Several music critics, like Kate Kiefer of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', noted the lyrical disparity between "White Horse" and Swift's previous single, "[[Love Story (Taylor Swift song)|Love Story]]", where Swift viewed fairytales in a positive light, with a [[happy ending]].<ref name="billboardreview" /><ref name="paste" /> Kiefer assumed that "White Horse" withdrew everything she said in "Love Story".<ref name="paste" />

August Brown of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' compared the song with [[Dolly Parton]]'s "[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]" (1973), saying Parton would have recognized her own predicament in "White Horse" and may have congratulated Swift for attempting to move on.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/05/live-taylor-swift-at-the-staples-center.html#more|title=Live: Taylor Swift at the Staples Center|first=August|last=Brown|date=May 23, 2009|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref> Jonathan Keefe of [[Slant Magazine]] called "White Horse" a "lovely ballad" with a prominent hook and deemed it "easily the best song" on ''Fearless''.

On the week ending November 29, 2008, "White Horse" debuted and peaked at number thirteen on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

The accompanying [[music video]] for "White Horse" was directed by [[Trey Fanjoy]], who directed all of Swift's prior music videos. Swift commented that Fanjoy was her first choice to film the video because she understood the direction Swift wanted to take and how to make the video different than the prior ones they filmed.<ref name="onsetwhitehorse" /> The video's plot centered on infidelity. However, because the theme had appeared on the video for "[[Picture to Burn]]", the scenario was reversed, rather than removed entirely, for Swift thought it was inevitable to include it. It was conceptualized so that Swift was the person who someone was unfaithful to, but the one who someone was unfaithful with: "This girl falls in love with this guy and he's perfect. He's adorable. He's charming. He's endearing. She falls in love with him. Then, she comes to realize that he's been leading a double life. He was already in a relationship years before he ever met her [...] You find out that I'm the one that was ruining a relationship without even knowing it."<ref name="onsetwhitehorse" /> Swift chose actor [[Stephen Colletti]] to portray the role of her love interest. She had previously seen him on the reality television series ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County]]'', where she acknowledged him to be "cute", and later on ''[[One Tree Hill]]'', where she was impressed by his acting skills; thus, Colletti was contacted to portray the character.<ref name="onsetwhitehorse" /> Swift chose Colletti primarily because of his sweet and endearing demeanor. As a result, the character would seem very loyal, as though he would never betray his partner. Therefore, others did not expect for him to betray Swift either. "That's always the hardest thing, when someone has you fooled so much that you think they're never gonna hurt you. And then they do. That's when you get the worst heartbreak", Swift said.<ref name="onsetwhitehorse" />

The video was shot in one day in January 2009 in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name="onsetwhitehorse" /><ref name="mtvvideo">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1602658/taylor-swift-talks-about-emotional-new-video-white-horse.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift Talks About 'Emotional' New |Video For 'White Horse'|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|date=January 14, 2009|work=''[[MTV News]]''|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=March 15, 2011}}</ref> Frolicking scenes between Swift and Colletti were filmed first; the lunch, outdoor, and indoor scenes followed.<ref name="onsetwhitehorse" /> Coincidentally, on the day of filming, it rained heavily, something which Swift was enlightened by, since it corresponded to the video's gloomy and dark feel. Swift said it aided in making the video less colorful lighting-wise, and more fixated on muted tones.<ref name="onsetwhitehorse" /> The last scenes were more difficult for Swift because they involved crying. She attributed the difficulty to the number of people surrounding her and watching, something she was not accustomed to. However, Fanjoy, who was once an actress, guided her into thinking about what made her most solemn, and completing the scene effectively.<ref name="onsetwhitehorse" /> Fanjoy said the scenes demonstrated what an exceptional actress Swift was, adding she took direction very well.<ref name="onsetwhitehorse" /> The scene took approximately three hours to film.<ref name="mtvvideo" />

The video premiered on February 7, 2009 on [[CMT]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1604409/taylor-swifts-white-horse-video-to-premiere-exclusively-on-cmt.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift's "White Horse" Video to Premiere Exclusively on CMT|date=February 5, 2009|work=''CMT News''|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=March 15, 2011}}</ref> The video commences with a close-ups of Swift's and Caltletti's mouths as they speak via telephone. He begins, "All I want is you. Do you love me?" She affirms, and he asks for another chance. The video transitions to Swift sitting on the living room floor, next to a fireplace. She performs as she [[flashback|flashes back]] to memories with Colletti. The two frolic on a brown couch and play with a deck of cards. The video then transitions to Swift and her friend having lunch a restaurant, where Swift's friend informs her of Colletti's betrayal. The two converse and, then, Swift is seen walking on the streets during nighttime. She sees Colletti arriving at a house with groceries and, after staring at each other, a redheaded woman walks out of the house. In a panic, Swift runs away and the video transcends to the phone call, which commenced in the beginning of the video, with Colletti repeating, "Will you give me another chance?" A rapid flashback of cut-scenes is played and, after its conclusion, Swift denies his request, hangs up, and cries.
