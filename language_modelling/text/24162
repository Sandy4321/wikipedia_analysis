[[File:Byzantine Constantinople eng.png|right|250px|thumb|Map of Byzantine Constantinople. The Manast<U+0131>r Mosque is located near the central section of the land walls.]]
'''Manast<U+0131>r Mosque''' ({{lang-tr|Manast<U+0131>r Mescidi}}; also ''Mustafa <U+00C7>avu<U+015F> Mescidi'', where ''mescit'' is the Turkish word for a small mosque) is a former [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[church (building)|church]] converted into a [[mosque]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. Neither archeological excavations nor medieval sources have made it possible to find a satisfactory answer as to its original dedication as a church. It is however possible that the small building was part of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] monastery dedicated to the '''Holy [[Martyr]]s [[Menodora, Metrodora, and Nymphodora]]''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|<U+039C><U+03BF><U+03BD><U+1FC6> <U+03C4><U+1FF6><U+03BD> <U+0386><U+03B3><U+03AF><U+03C9><U+03BD> <U+039C><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03B4><U+03CE><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03C2>, <U+039C><U+03B7><U+03C4><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03B4><U+03CE><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03C2> <U+03BA><U+03B1><U+1F76> <U+039D><U+03C5><U+03BC><U+03C6><U+03BF><U+03B4><U+03CE><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03C2>}}}}), or an annex of the nunnery of '''Kyra Martha''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|<U+039C><U+03BF><U+03BD><U+1FC6> <U+03C4><U+1F20><U+03C2> <U+039A><U+1F51><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03C2> <U+039C><U+03AC><U+03C1><U+03B8><U+03B1><U+03C2>}}}}). The edifice is a minor example of [[Byzantine architecture]] in [[Constantinople]], and is important for historical reasons.

==Location==
The [[Middle Ages|medieval]] structure lies in [[Istanbul]], in the district of [[Fatih]], in the neighborhood of [[Topkap<U+0131> , Istanbul|Topkap<U+0131>]], on the south side of ''Turgut <U+00D6>zal Caddesi'', about six hundred meters south east of the Topkap<U+0131> Gate of the [[Walls of Constantinople|city walls]]. The building can be easily reached from the center by the [[Public_transport_in_Istanbul#Line_T1|T1 Tram]].

==History==
[[File:Manastir Mosque 2010-10-09 01.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The east side with the apses.]]
The origin of this building, which lies on the seventh hill of [[Constantinople]], is unclear. As its Turkish name suggests, it is possible that it was a small chapel belonging to a monastery, possibly that dedicated to the Holy [[Martyr]]s Menodora, Metrodora, and Nymphodora, which existed near the [[Walls_of_Constantinople#Gate_of_St._Romanus|Gate of St. Romanus]] (today Topkap<U+0131>, in [[Turkish Language|Turkish]] <U+201C>Gate of the gun<U+201D>), in the neighborhood of Constantinople named ''ta Elebichou''.<ref name=ja384>Janin (1953), p. 384.</ref> In the first half of the 14th century, a certain Phokas Maroulas, [[Epi tes trapezes|''domestikos'' of the imperial table]], restored the church and dedicated it to the [[Theotokos]], founding a small monastery.<ref name=ja384/>
[[File:Manastir Mosque 2010-10-09 02.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The north side with the brickwork.]]

According to another hypothesis, the small building could be an annex of the monastery of Kyra Martha. <ref name=ey86>Eyice (1955), p. 86.</ref> This was founded in 1268 by Maria, sister of Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]]. As a widow, she took the [[Simple vow|vows]] taking the name of Martha and founded the nunnery which bore her new name.<ref name=ey86/> The monastery became a personal possession of the [[Palaiologoi]].  

Shortly after the [[Fall of Constantinople]], Mustafa, a ''[[<U+00E7>avu<U+015F>]]'' ([[Page (servant)|page]]) of [[Mehmed II|Sultan Mehmed II]], converted the building into a ''mescit'' (oratory).<ref name=mw194>M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener (1977), p. 194.</ref> During the years 1956<U+2013>58 the buildings cluttering around the small mosque were torn down during the opening of ''Turgut <U+00D6>zal Caddesi'', and since then its usage as worship place ceased. It is now incorporated into the wall which protects one of [[Public_transport_in_Istanbul#Bus_system|Istanbul<U+2019>s bus garages]],<ref name=mw194/> and, due to its position, it cannot be visited without written permission from the bus company.

==Description==
Due to its small dimensions, the building cannot be identified as a church, but rather as an oratory belonging to a monastery. The edifice has a rectangular shape, and nowadays has a single [[nave]] with three projecting [[apse]]s to the east and a [[narthex]] to the west. The interior decoration has, for the most part, not survived. Only two hammered carved [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], part of the triple arcade between the narthex and the [[naos]], are still in place.<ref name=ja384/> The roof and the windows have also been modified. <ref name=mw194/>  Excavations during the 1960s have shown that the building's original plan was more complex. <ref name=mw194/>  The small church had three naves (possibly surmounted by a dome) and a tripartite [[bema]]. <ref name=mw194/>  On the west side lay an exonarthex topped by a vault, while in the south side a small chapel with esonarthexes on three sides was built.<ref name=mw194/> Based on its [[masonry]] and plan, the building can be dated to the late eleventh century,<ref name=mw194/> although according to other scholars <ref name=ma258>Mamboury (1953), p. 258.</ref> the [[brickwork]] texture could also stem from the [[Byzantine architecture#Comnenian and Paleologan periods|Palaiologan age]] (13th<U+2013>15th century).
