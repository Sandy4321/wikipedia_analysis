'''''The Apprentice''''' is a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award-winning British [[reality television series]] in which a group of aspiring young businessmen and women compete for the chance to win a <U+00A3>100,000-a-year job as "[[apprenticeship|apprentice]]" to the British business magnate [[Alan Sugar| Alan Sugar, The Baron Sugar]]. Winners have gone on to work at [[Amstrad]], an electronics manufacturing company founded by Sir Alan (but since sold to [[BSkyB]]),<ref>{{cite press release |title=First Day At The Office For The New Apprentice |publisher=[[Amstrad]] |date=2005-05-10 |url=http://www.amstrad.com/press/news/news_firstday.html |accessdate=2007-05-11 }}</ref><ref name="bbc-4511797">{{cite news |title=Apprentice TV winner to be chosen |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4511797.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-05-04 |accessdate=2007-05-11 }}</ref> or one of Sugar's other companies, [[Viglen]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,,1884521,00.html |title=Michelle Dewberry quits Viglen to start her own company |publisher=Guardian |date= 30 September 2006 |accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref> [[Amsprop]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6924004.stm |title=Q&A: Does Sky deal mean end for Amstrad? |publisher=BBC News, |date=31 July 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref> or Amshold.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/03_march/17/apprentice_notes.shtml "The Apprentice <U+2013> Notes to Editors"], ''BBC Press Office'', 17 March 2009</ref> ''The Apprentice'', billed as a "job interview from hell", is similar in format to the [[The Apprentice (US TV Series)|American series]] of the same name, which stars entrepreneur [[Donald Trump]].<ref name="bbc-3727649">{{cite news |title=Tycoon Sugar heads reality show |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3727649.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-05-19 |accessdate=2007-05-11 }}</ref>

==Format==
===Candidate selection===

Open auditions and interviews are held across the country before a series begins,<ref>{{cite news |first=Julie |last=McCaffrey |title=The Day I Tried To Become The Apprentice |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/tm_method=full%26objectid=18813383%26siteid=89520-name_page.html |publisher=[[The Daily Mirror]] |date=2007-03-27 |accessdate=2007-04-23 }}</ref> attracting thousands of applicants.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/apprentice/newsarticle/cid/3.html |title=The Apprentice - News Article |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref> The first and second series featured 14 candidates, increased to 16 in the third and fourth. The fifth series was also meant to have 16 candidates, but went ahead with only 15 after a last-minute withdrawal.

===Tasks===

The successful candidates are split into two teams, initially by sex (as candidate numbers are whittled down, the composition of the teams is periodically rearranged). The teams are then given a series of business-themed tasks designed to test their skills in salesmanship, negotiation, requisitioning, leadership, teamwork and organisation, with each episode covering a single task. At the start of each episode, the teams each choose a [[project manager]] to act as the team leader for the duration of the task,<ref name="sum">{{cite news |url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/primetime/the_apprentice |title=The Apprentice - Background |accessdate=2007-04-23 |publisher=What's On TV |year=2007 }}</ref> though in later episodes the project managers are sometimes nominated by Baron Sugar himself. The teams are followed in the execution of their tasks by Baron Sugar's advisers, [[Nick Hewer]] and [[Margaret Mountford]].<ref name="spy">{{cite news |first=Sam | last=Wollaston |title=Spying for Sir Alan |url=http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2044526,00.html |publisher=Guardian |date=2007-03-28 |accessdate=2007-04-23 }}</ref>

===Boardroom===

After completion of a task, the teams report back to the "boardroom", a studio mock-up of a real company boardroom.<ref name="Interview: Jasper Gerard meets Tim Campbell">{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article519904.ece |title=Interview: Jasper Gerard meets Tim Campbell|accessdate=2007-05-17 |publisher=[[The Sunday Times]] | date =8 May 2005}}</ref> Here Sir Alan, with the help of his advisers, reveals the results and discusses the teams' performance, exposing flaws in the candidates' strategies and personalities. Sugar, who is introduced in the programme as "Britain's most belligerent boss",<ref>''The Apprentice'' series four opening sequences.</ref> frequently delivers scathing criticisms couched in colourful language ("that was a total bloody disaster" ... "you haven't got a bloody clue" ... "I'll fire the whole bloody lot of you if I have to").

The losing team is then subjected to a further detailed examination by Baron Sugar, after which the team's project manager is required to choose two team members to accompany him or her into a final round of interrogation.<ref name="sum" /> These are nominally the two poorest performing members of the team, but in practice the project manager may act treacherously and make choices based on personality. The discussions often become acrimonious as each candidate tries to divert blame towards the others. Finally, Sir Alan dismisses one of the three with the catchphrase, "You're fired!", and that candidate is eliminated from the competition.<ref name="sum"/> 

The fired candidate is then shown being despatched into a waiting taxi for the "journey home", and is briefly interviewed in the taxi to reflect on his or her rejection from the competition. On rare occasions, two candidates have been fired in a single episode.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/apprentice/newsarticle/cid/34.html |title=Exit Rory and Ifti |publisher = BBC|accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref> The surviving candidates are sent back to the accommodation that is provided for the duration of the show.

===Interviews and Grand Finale===

When only four candidates remain (or five in later series), they undergo individual interviews, resulting in the selection of two finalists.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Episode 11 |episodelink=The Apprentice (UK Series Three)#Week 11: Interviews |series=The Apprentice Series Three |serieslink=The Apprentice (UK Series Three) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=2007-06-06 |season=3 |number=11 }}</ref> These two proceed to the Grand Finale and perform one last task with teams chosen from the previously fired contestants, after which one is told, "You're hired!", and wins the highly-paid executive job working with Sir Alan.<ref name="sum" />

In fact, two versions of the final boardroom sequence are filmed&mdash;showing each of the finalists winning. Between filming and transmission&mdash;a period of about six months&mdash;both finalists work for Sir Alan in temporary jobs. Sir Alan does not reveal his decision about who he is going to hire until shortly before transmission, and this determines which ending is shown. The BBC has issued contradictory statements about the decision procedure. The first version of events is that Sir Alan makes his decision on the day that the final boardroom sequence is filmed, based on the contestants' performance in the final task, and keeps it secret until just before transmission.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/apprentice/about/workings.shtml |title=The Workings of The Apprentice |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-06-10}}</ref> The second version is that Sir Alan decides ''after'' the six-month trial period.<ref name="10 things">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6729621.stm |title=10 things about the apprentices |publisher=BBC News |date=7 June 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref> Former contestant [[Saira Khan]] also stated that "His final decision is not based on the programme that people see. His final decision is based on these two people [who] have been working with him for the six months."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4753487.stm "The Apprentice's growing success"], BBC News, 10 May 2006</ref>

===Schedule===

Unlike most reality television programmes, the whole of ''The Apprentice'' is pre-recorded; typically the series is shot during the autumn for transmission the following year.<ref>{{cite news |title=Irish mum fired-up to be Sir Alan's apprentice |url=http://www.irishpost.co.uk/news/story.asp?j=5484&cat=news |publisher=The Irish Post |date=2007-04-04 |accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> 

The candidates live together in a large rented house or apartment for the duration of the competition.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Coffee To Go |episodelink=The Apprentice (UK Series Three)#Week 1: Coffee To Go |series=The Apprentice Series Three |serieslink=The Apprentice (UK Series Three) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=2007-03-28 |season=3 |number=1}}</ref> Owing to the twelve-week broadcast schedule, the audience is given the impression that the candidates stay for 12 weeks in the house and that there are breaks between tasks. The series is actually filmed in about two months,<ref name="10 things"/> and the filming schedule means that the tasks are generally performed one after the other.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/realitytv/a46405/the-apprentice-adam-hosker.html |title= 'The Apprentice': Adam Hosker |accessdate=2007-05-16 |publisher=DigitalSpy |year=2007}}</ref>

Compared to the US series, the UK version has a more rigid format that requires twelve episodes per series and at least four candidates for the final round of interviews. This meant that in the first two series multiple firings were not allowed at all (which was acknowledged in the second series when Sir Alan expressed his desire to fire both Alexa Tilley and [[Syed Ahmed]], but could only get rid of the former), and subsequent series allow Sir Alan to conduct either two double firings or one treble firing, the latter of which first occured in the Interviews week of 2009 when James McQuillan, Lorraine Tighe and Debra Barr were all fired.

Rumours of a UK version of ''The Apprentice'' were confirmed in early 2004 by [[FremantleMedia]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a13929/the-apprentice-coming-to-uk.html | title='The Apprentice' coming to UK | publisher=[[Digital Spy]] | date=18 March 2004 | accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref> Both BBC Two and [[Channel 4]] bid for the show<U+2019>s rights<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a14075/bbc-two-favourite-to-win-apprentice-rights.html |title=BBC Two favourite to win 'Apprentice' rights |accessdate=2007-05-16 |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |date=2004-04-01}}</ref> &ndash; the BBC was eventually successful.<ref name="alan">{{cite news |title=Talkback confirms Apprentice UK star

In August 2008, the American cable channel [[CNBC]] began to present the first series on Monday nights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20080807cnbc01 |title=Breaking News - "APPRENTICE UK" WILL START AIRING AUGUST 25TH ON CNBC |publisher=TheFutonCritic.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-22}}</ref> However, the programme aired in disparate time slots or not at all due to the network's abrupt shifting of their programme schedule in order to cover developments regarding the [[global financial crisis of 2008<U+2013>2009]]. The series did not air in full, and eventually as CNBC decided to focus their prime time schedule on financial news programming, the programme's rights moved to [[BBC America]], where it started transmission on 5 May 2009.

===Series Two===
{{main|The Apprentice (UK series two)}}

The day after the conclusion of Series One, the BBC confirmed that a second series would be broadcast in early 2006 and, despite initial doubts, Sugar's involvement was confirmed soon afterwards.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/realitytv/a21032/bbcs-apprentice-gets-second-series.html |title=BBC's 'Apprentice' gets second series |accessdate=2007-05-16 |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |date=2005-05-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/realitytv/a21043/confirmed-sugar-to-return-for-second-apprentice.html |title=Confirmed: Sugar to return for second 'Apprentice' |accessdate=2007-05-16 |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |date=2005-05-06}} Retrieved on 2007-08-04</ref> The second series began on 22 February 2006 and a spin-off programme was introduced on [[BBC Three]], called ''[[The Apprentice: You're Fired!]]'' and hosted by [[Adrian Chiles]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/realitytv/a27150/spinoff-show-planned-for-next-uk-apprentice.html |title=Spinoff show planned for next UK 'Apprentice' |accessdate=2007-05-16 |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |date=2005-12-10}}</ref>

Series Five began its run on BBC One on 25 March 2009 with 15 contestants. A sixteenth participant pulled out the day before filming began. The Grand Finale was aired on Sunday 7 June 2009, where Sir Alan hired Yasmina Siadatan over the runner up Kate Walsh.

===Series Six===

In May 2009, after an episode of ''The Apprentice: You're Fired!'', it was announced that the application process had begun for a sixth UK series. It will be filmed during autumn 2009 for transmission in early 2010. [[Margaret Mountford]] will not return for series six.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/theapprentice/a158546/margaret-mountford-quits-the-apprentice.html Margaret Mountford quits 'The Apprentice']</ref> It has also been reported that the BBC Trust have announced that transmission of the next series of 'The Apprentice' may be rescheduled if an general election is called, because of Alan Sugar's new political role. Baron Sugar has been made a Labour peer and is the government's newly-appointed enterprise champion and some critics have said his continued role in the show could compromise the BBC's political impartiality.

==The Board==
{{Apprenticecandidates}}
Along with "the boss," Sir Alan Sugar, two advisors follow the contestants during their weekly activities: [[Nick Hewer]] and [[Margaret Mountford]]. These three constitute "The Board"&mdash;the panel that evaluates the teams' performance.

Sir Alan Sugar is an English businessman and the founder of electronics company [[Amstrad]]. He has an estimated fortune of <U+00A3>830m and was ranked 84th in the [[Sunday Times Rich List 2007]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/pdfs/richlist_2007_08_football.pdf |format=PDF|title=The football millionaires |accessdate=2007-05-19 |publisher=[[Times Online]]}}</ref> Sugar was knighted in 2000 for services to business and holds two honorary [[Doctorate of Science]] degrees, awarded in 1988 by [[City University, London|City University]] and in 2005 by [[Brunel University]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.brunel.ac.uk/about/hongrads/2005/sugar |title=Honorary graduates - Sir Alan Sugar |publisher=[[Brunel University]] |accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> He is a donor to the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1829252.stm |title=Who's funding who? |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-02-19 |accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref> and has given money to charities such as [[Jewish Care]] and [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article1921905.ece |title=Show business |publisher=The Times |date=2007-06-13 |accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref> In July 2007, Sugar sold his stake in Amstrad to [[BSkyB]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6923517.stm |title=BSkyB agrees <U+00A3>125m Amstrad deal |publisher=BBC News |date=31 July 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref> and has since left the business.<ref>[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/02/sugar_leaves_amstrad/ "Alan Sugar leaves Amstrad"], ''The Register'', 2 July 2008</ref>

Early series of the show made frequent reference to Sugar's connection with Amstrad, but in the fourth series, following the deal with BSkyB, reference to Amstrad was dropped. Sugar is now billed simply as controlling a "vast business empire" (most of which is actually in property).<ref>[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/columnists/article2176362.ece "Alan Sugar is no shareholder idol"], ''The Times'', 1 August 2007</ref> Future winners will be employed by one of Sir Alan's other companies, such as [[Amsair]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Logged in as click here to log out |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/organgrinder/2007/07/sir_alans_amstrad_deal_what_do.html |title=Sir Alan's Amstrad deal: What does it mean for The Apprentice?

[[Nick Hewer]] is a former [[public relations]] officer. His involvement with Sir Alan began when his company was chosen to represent Amstrad in 1983. Hewer's role was as a PR manager, working with the media and press. He also became an integral part of Amstrad<U+2019>s corporate management.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/apprentice/board/id/11/type/boardmember.html |title=BBC - The Apprentice - The Board |accessdate=2007-05-16 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> He lives in France.<ref>{{cite news |first=Joanne |last=Moore |title=Dad tells of pride in Sir Alan<U+2019>s right hand man |url=http://www.gazetteandherald.co.uk/news/swindon/display.var.758161.0.dad_tells_of_pride_in_sir_alans_right_hand_man.php |publisher=[[Gazette and Herald]] |date=2006-05-11 |accessdate=2007-05-13 }}</ref>

[[Margaret Mountford]] has worked with Sugar as one of his main advisers for 20 years, and is a non-executive director of Amstrad [[Public limited company|PLC]]. She has many years<U+2019> corporate law experience as a partner in the law firm [[Herbert Smith]], where she met Sugar when working on Amstrad's flotation. She retired from the firm in March 1999, and was appointed to the Amstrad board on 22 September 1999. She is also a non-executive director at Georgica PLC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amstrad.com/about/margaret_mountford.html |title=Amstrad Board of Directors |accessdate=2007-05-16 |publisher=Amstrad}}</ref> In her column for the Daily Telegraph on 1 June 2009, Margaret announced the current series of The Apprentice (series five) will be her last, as she intends to devote more time to her studies.  She is currently studying for a PhD in papyrology at University College London, studying documents found in Egypt and written in ancient Greek.<ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/5422704/Interview-Margaret-Mountford-on-her-last-series-of-The-Apprentice.html |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |date=2009-06-01 |accessdate=2009-06-07}}</ref>

==Filming locations==
The tasks are mostly filmed in and around the London area, though the contestants have on occasion been sent as far afield as France, the Mediterranean and Morocco. In Series One, the team house was located in [[Chiswick]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/buying_and_selling/article1078478.ece |title=TV house open for business |publisher=[[Times Online]] |date=2005-02-27 |accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref> A location in [[Hampstead Heath]] was used in Series Two and another in [[Notting Hill]] for the third series.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/femail/article.html?in_article_id=436491&in_page_id=1879 |title=My love for Syed tore me apart |publisher=[[Daily Mail]] |date=2007-02-19 |accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/2007/06/11/sugar-s-trade-secrets-89520-19276857/ |title=Sugar's Trade Secrets |publisher=[[The Daily Mirror]] |date=2007-06-11 |accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref> In Series Four, the candidates' accommodation was a converted glass factory in [[Battersea]]<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/03/25/sv_apprentice.xml&page=3 "The Apprentice: Behind the scenes with Sir Alan Sugar"], ''Telegraph'', 25/03/2008</ref> and in Series 5, the candidates lived in a penthouse house at Portobello Lofts, [[Ladbroke Grove]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portobellodock.com/home.html |title=Portobello Dock |accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref>

''The Apprentice'' regularly features clips of aerial footage over the skyscrapers of the [[City of London|Square Mile]] and [[Canary Wharf]] financial districts, such as the 180-metre [[30 St Mary Axe|Gherkin]], [[HSBC Tower, London|HSBC Tower]], [[One Canada Square]], and the [[Citigroup Centre, London|Citigroup Centre]]. Amstrad<U+2014>Sugar's former company that was prominently referenced in early series<U+2014>does not have offices in either locale, and the company's real location, in [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]], [[Essex]] was rarely mentioned.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Episode 1 |episodelink=The Apprentice (UK Series One)#Week 1: Wilting Blooms |series=The Apprentice Series One |serieslink=The Apprentice (UK Series One) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC Two]] |airdate=2005-02-16 |season=1 |number=1 }}</ref>

The "boardroom" (and the reception area outside) is in fact a custom-built set in a West London television studio,<ref name="Interview: Jasper Gerard meets Tim Campbell"/> and the boardroom receptionist ("Frances" in Series One, Three, Four and Five, "Jenny" in Series Two) is an actress, not Sugar's real secretary.<ref name=triv>{{cite web |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/2007/06/11/sugar-s-trade-secrets-89520-19276857/ |title=Sugar's Trade Secrets |accessdate=2007-07-30 |publisher=[[Daily Mirror]]}}</ref>

The candidates' "walk of shame" exit sequences are actually filmed at the beginning of the series,<ref name=triv/> at the same time as the scene in which they are shown entering the Amstrad building at the start of the first episode. This explains why the clothes worn by fired candidates in their exit sequences sometimes differ from those worn in the boardroom scene ostensibly filmed only moments earlier.<ref name="clothes"/> In more noticeable cases, hairstyles have also been different.<ref name="clothes">{{cite episode |title=Episode 7 |episodelink=The Apprentice (UK Series Two)#Week 7: Select and sell merchandise to consumers at Oxford St Top Shop |series=The Apprentice Series Two |serieslink=The Apprentice (UK Series Two) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC Two]] |airdate=2006-04-05 |season=2 |number=7 }}</ref> The post-firing taxi ride merely takes the candidate around the block to allow their taxi interview to be filmed.

==Reception==
===Praise===
The programme has been given positive reviews by several newspapers. In the popular press, ''[[The Sun]]'' newspaper has called it "The thinking man's reality show", and ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' described it as "jaw-dropping viewing".<ref name=bbc-press>{{cite press release |publisher=BBC Press Office |date=7 February 2006 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/02_february/07/apprentice.shtml |title=The Apprentice - series two - starts 9.00pm on Wednesday 22 February 2006 on BBC TWO |accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> Broadsheet newspapers have given the programme a similarly positive reception, with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' calling it "The most addictive show in years",<ref name=bbc-press /> and ''[[The Guardian]]'' saying that it provided "A salutary lesson in aggressive buying and selling, hiring and firing". ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' said that it was "not just a game show: it's a business school."<ref name=bbc-press /> ''[[The Evening Standard]]'' was also favourable, describing the programme as "terribly compelling".<ref name=bbc-press />

===Criticism===
The programme has been criticised in the British media for suggesting that success in the business world requires possession of unsavoury qualities. [[Terence Blacker]] of ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper, for example, said that he believed that the programme falsely linked success with being "nasty, disloyal, greedy and selfish".<ref>{{cite news |first=Terence |last=Blacker |title=Why I'm not sold on 'The Apprentice' |url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/columnists_a_l/terence_blacker/article2488794.ece |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=2007-04-27 |accessdate=2007-05-11 }}</ref> [[Talk show]] host [[Sir Michael Parkinson]] has also expressed misgivings about the programme, describing it as being "full of vulgar, loud people who, for all the wrong reasons, are dobbing each other in".<ref>{{cite news |first=Nicola |last=Methven |title=Parky's Sugar Blast |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/showbiz/latest/tm_headline=parky-s-sugar-blast&method=full&objectid=18849716&siteid=89520-name_page.html |publisher=[[The Daily Mirror]] |date=2007-04-03 |accessdate=2007-05-10 }}</ref>

The premise of the show itself has been called into question by some members of the business world. Steve Carter, the head of recruitment firm Nigel Lynn, described the "brutality" of the recruitment process as being unrealistic.<ref name="Independent-NickJackson">{{cite news |first=Nick|last=Jackson|title= The Apprentice is just good television |url=http://education.independent.co.uk/careers_advice/article2525550.ece |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=2007-05-10 |accessdate=2007-05-11 }}</ref> In response to these criticisms, a [[spokesperson]] for ''The Apprentice'' has been quoted as saying "The show isn't designed as a tool for recruiters... but it does highlight and thoroughly test key business skills such as leadership, teamwork, dedication and strategic thinking &ndash; integral skills most recruiters are looking for".<ref name="Independent-NickJackson" />

Former contestant and runner-up [[Saira Khan]] has criticised the programme because the final two candidates both work with Sir Alan Sugar for a few months before he decides whom he will hire. Khan stated that "[Sir Alan Sugar's] final decision is not based on the programme that people see, his final decision is based on these two people who have been working with him for the six months." Khan also said that the show is more concerned with giving viewers a [[rags-to-riches]] ending than employing the most able candidate, and that the show promotes [[bullying]] in the workplace.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Apprentice's growing success |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4753487.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-05-10 |accessdate=2007-05-10 }}</ref>

Former contestants [[Lucinda Ledgerwood]] and [[James Max]] have criticised the tasks on the show as being too heavily sales-focused and designed for entertainment rather than as tests of all-round business skills.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7436437.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; Apprentice reject was 'too zany' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-06-05 |accessdate=2009-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/lucinda_ledgerwood/blog/2008/06/10/the_apprentice_lucinda_ledgerwood_blog__day_4 |title=Whoops!

A number of people have criticised the show's editing and production methods. Contestants [[Syed Ahmed]] and Tre Azam accused the show of dumbing down their appearances for entertainment.<ref>{{cite news |title='Apprentice' star complains about editing |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/realitytv/a45567/apprentice-star-complains-about-editing.html |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |date=2007-04-22 |accessdate=2007-07-12 }}</ref> Gerri Blackwood said that her boardroom scene was filmed again to make it look better.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sugar Show's sex shock |url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/posts/view/12782/Sugar-Show-s-sex-shock |publisher=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]] |date=2007-04-13 |accessdate=2008-03-26 }}</ref>

===Parodies and imitations===
The show has been imitated in the [[ITV]] programme ''[[Harry Hill's TV Burp]]''.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Apprentice's Jo Cameron |episodelink= |series=Harry Hill's TV Burp |serieslink=Harry Hill's TV Burp |credits=[[Harry Hill]], [[Jo Cameron]], [[Sharon McAllister]], [[Ruth Badger]] |network=[[ITV]] |station=[[ITV]] |airdate=2006-03-26 }}</ref> It was also mocked in the BBC impressionist programme ''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'', in which Sir Alan Sugar turns fired contestants into [[frogs]] and the candidates are portrayed as failed applicants of ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' who are seeking their [[15 minutes of fame]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0313056/episodes#season-5 |title=Dead Ringers Episode Guide-Series 5, Episode 2|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref> Several parodies have been uploaded onto the popular video publishing website, [[YouTube]], notably Michael Sophocles' overexaggerated celebration in Sir Alan's boardroom from Series Four.

[[Rory Bremner]] did an impression of Sir Alan on the show ''[[Bremner Bird and Fortune]]''; he was in the boardroom with the main London Mayoral candidates, [[Boris Johnson]], [[Ken Livingstone]] and [[Brian Paddick]], and after each of the candidates failed to get a single vote according to his results, he hired himself for the job claiming he "would make a profit on City Hall".

In early 2007, the show was mocked in the television programme ''Kombat Opera Presents The Applicants''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article1464145.ece |title=How does sir like his TV?

In June 2007, shortly after the conclusion of Series Three of ''The Apprentice'', rival UK channel [[ITV]] began airing ''[[Tycoon (TV series)|Tycoon]]'', described in ''The Times'' as "a shameless rip-off of The Apprentice".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article1955417.ece |title=Last night<U+2019>s TV |publisher=The Times |date=20 June 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-31}}</ref> [[Mark Thompson]], The BBC's director general, accused ITV of "copycatting" and said that ''Tycoon'' was "very like The Apprentice, and there's possibly a bit of Dragons' Den in there".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,2117447,00.html|title='ITV are copycats,' says BBC|first=Tara|last=Conlan|accessdate=2007-10-17 |publisher=Guardian |date=2007-07-03}}</ref> The series followed ''[[Dragons' Den]]'' star [[Peter Jones (entrepreneur)|Peter Jones']] search for a new business tycoon.<ref>{{cite news |first=Joanne |last=Oatts |title=Peter Jones and the 'Tycoons' |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/realitytv/a58129/peter-jones-and-the-tycoons.html |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |date=2007-07-07 |accessdate=2007-08-31 }}</ref> It proved relatively unsuccessful and was removed from a [[prime time]] slot on Tuesdays after achieving fewer than 2 million viewers, over 2.5 million below the channel's average.<ref>{{cite news |first=Neil |last=Wilkes |title=ITV yanks 'Tycoon' from prime slot |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a63023/itv-yanks-tycoon-from-prime-slot.html |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2007-08-31 }}</ref> The final episode attracted just 1.3 million viewers.<ref name="tycoonlow">{{cite news |first=Neil |last=Wilkes |title=Series low for 'Tycoon' finale |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a67519/series-low-for-tycoon-finale.html |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |date=2007-07-24 |accessdate=2007-08-31 }}</ref> The programme's winner, Iain Morgan, won a prize of over <U+00A3>200,000.<ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |title=Iain Morgan is winner of 'Tycoon' |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/realitytv/a67431/iain-morgan-is-winner-of-tycoon.html |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |date=2007-07-24 |accessdate=2007-08-31 }}</ref><ref name="tycoonlow"/>

In the fourth series of ''[[Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe]]'', [[Charlie Brooker|Brooker]] parodied ''The Apprentice'', with Brooker taking on the role of a Sugar-like character dressed in a crown and gown. Instead of saying "you're fired" he said "you're fucked" to the contestants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RsLY5b1GcI|title=Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe Special - Preview - BBC Four|publisher=BBC, on YouTube|date=2007-10-19|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref>

''The Apprentice'' has included various pieces of classical and popular music throughout. Numerous pieces from [[film soundtrack]]s are also used. Examples of the music used include the opening theme ("[[Montagues and Capulets|Dance of the Knights]]" from ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' by [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]) and "The Boardroom", "You're Fired" and "Closing Credits" from ''The Apprentice (Original Theme)'' by [[Dru Masters]].
