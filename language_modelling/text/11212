'''Kennewick Man''' is the name for the skeletal [[remains]] of a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] ([[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian]])  man found on a [[stream bed|bank]] of the [[Columbia River]] in [[Kennewick, Washington]], [[USA]], on July 28, 1996. The discovery of Kennewick Man was accidental; a pair of spectators (Will Thomas and David Deacy) found his [[Human skull|skull]] while attending the annual [[Hydroplane (boat)|hydroplane]] races.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kennewick-man.com/kman/news/story/2888895p-2924726c.html|title=Skull found on shore of Columbia|publisher=Tri-City Herald|author=Stang, John|date=2005-06-20|accessdate=2007-05-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070425113738/http://www.kennewick-man.com/kman/news/story/2888895p-2924726c.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-25}}</ref>

One of the most complete ancient skeletons ever found, bone tests have shown the skeleton to be somewhere between 5650 and 9510 years old. These findings triggered a nine-year legal clash between scientists, the federal government and Native American tribes who claim Kennewick Man as their ancestor.
The long dispute has made him an international celebrity.

In February 2004, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ruled that a cultural link between any of the Native American tribes and the Kennewick Man was not genetically justified, allowing scientific study of the remains to continue.<ref name=Bonnichsen>[http://archive.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/AAFB80F54839DD2D88256E300069CF95/$file/0235994.pdf?openelement ''Bonnichsen, et al. v. United States, et al.,''] no. 02-35994 (9th Cir. Feb. 4, 2004)</ref>

In July 2005, a team of scientists from around the United States convened in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] for ten days to study the remains, making many detailed measurements and determining the cause of death.

==Scientific significance==
[[Image:Kennewickstanford.jpg|thumb|The remains of the Kennewick Man]]
The remains had been scattered in the [[Columbia Park, Kennewick|reservoir]] due to erosion. Following delivery of the cranium by the coroner, they were examined by archaeologist [[James Chatters]]. After ten visits to the site, Chatters had managed to collect 350 bones and pieces of bone, which with the skull completed almost an entire skeleton.<ref name="Custred_2000">{{cite journal|author=Custred, Glynn|title=The Forbidden Discovery of Kennewick Man|journal=Academic Questions|volume=13|issue=3|year=2000|pages=12<U+2013>30|doi=10.1007/s12129-000-1034-8}}</ref> The cranium was fully intact with all the teeth that had been present at the time of death.<ref name="Chattersweb"/> All major bones were found, except the [[Human sternum|sternum]] and a few bones of the hands and feet.  The remains were determined to  be those of "a male of late middle age (40-55 years), and tall (170 to 176 cm), slender build".<ref name="Chattersweb">Chatters, James C. (2004).  Kennewick Man.  Retrieved from http://www.mnh.si.edu/arctic/html/kennewick_man.html.</ref>  Many of the bones were broken into several pieces.<ref name="Chatters_2000">{{cite journal|author=Chatters, James C.|year=2000|title=The Recovery and First Analysis of an Early Holocene Human|journal=American Antiquity|volume=65|issue=2|pages=291<U+2013>316|doi=10.2307/2694060|pmid=17216899|publisher=American Antiquity, Vol. 65, No. 2|jstor=2694060}}</ref> At the [[University of California at Riverside]], a small bone fragment was subjected to [[radiocarbon dating]]. This fixed the age of the skeleton at approximately 9,300 years (8,400 [[Radiocarbon dating#Calibration|uncalibrated]] "radiocarbon years"), not the nineteenth century, as had originally been assumed.<ref name="Custred_2000" /> After studying the bones, Chatters concluded they belonged to a [[Caucasoid]] male about {{convert|68|in|cm|0}} tall who had died in his mid fifties.<ref name="Custred_2000" />

Chatters found that bone had partially grown around a {{convert|79|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} stone projectile lodged in the ilium, part of the pelvic bone.<ref name="Chatters_2000" /> On x-ray, nothing appeared. Chatters put the bone through a CT scan, and it was discovered the projectile was made from a siliceous gray stone that was found to have igneous (intrusive volcanic) origins.<ref name="Chatters_2000" />  The projectile was leaf-shaped, long, broad and had serrated edges, all fitting the definition of a [[Cascade point]]. This type of point is a feature of the [[Cascade phase]], which occurred roughly 7500 to 12000 years ago.<ref name="Chatters_2000" />

To further investigate the mystery of the Kennewick man and determine if the skeleton belonged to the Umatilla Native American tribe, an extraction of DNA was analyzed, and according to the report of the scientists doing the DNA analysis: "available technology and protocols do not allow the analysis of ancient DNA from these remains."<ref>http://www.nps.gov/archeology/kennewick/index.htm#dna</ref> 

Anthropologist Joseph Powell of the [[University of New Mexico]] was also allowed to examine the remains and his conclusions were contradictory. He said that Kennewick Man was not European but rather resembled South Asians and the [[Ainu people]] of northeast Asia.<ref name="Custred_2000" /> The results of a graphic comparison, including size, of Kennewick Man to 18 modern populations conducted by Chatters et al. showed he was most closely related to the Ainu. However, when size was excluded as a factor, no association to any population was established.<ref name="Custred_2000" />

The biological diversity among ancient skulls in the Americas has further complicated attempts to establish how closely Kennewick Man is related to any modern Native American tribes.<ref name="Custred_2000" /> Skulls older than 8,000 years old have been found to possess greater physical diversity than do those of modern Native Americans. This range implies that there was a genetic shift in populations about 8,000 years ago. The heterogeneity of these early people shows that [[genetic drift]] had already occurred, meaning the racial type represented by Kennewick Man had been in existence for a considerable period of time.<ref name="Custred_2000" />

The discovery of Kennewick Man, along with other ancient skeletons, has furthered scientific debate over the exact origin and history of early Native American people.<ref name="Custred_2000" />  The prevailing hypothesis holds that a single wave of migration occurred, consisting of hunters and gatherers following large herds of game, which wandered across the  [[Bering land bridge]] around 12,000 years ago. Other hypotheses contend that there were numerous waves of migration to the Americas. The apparent diversity of ancient skeletal remains, which may include traits not typically associated with modern Native Americans, has been used as evidence to support these rival hypotheses. Recent (2008) evidence on the genetics of modern populations suggests that they originated in a single migration.<ref name="pmid18313026">{{cite journal |author=Fagundes NJ, Kanitz R, Eckert R, ''et al.'' |title=Mitochondrial population genomics supports a single pre-Clovis origin with a coastal route for the peopling of the Americas |journal=Am.

==Ownership controversy==
According to the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]], if human remains are found on federal lands and their cultural affiliation to a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe can be established, the affiliated tribe can claim them. The [[Umatilla (tribe)|Umatilla]] tribe requested custody of the remains, wanting to bury them according to tribal tradition. Their claim was contested by researchers hoping to study the remains.

The Umatilla argued that their [[oral history]] goes back 10,000 years and say that their people have been present on their historical territory since the dawn of time,<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=David Hurst|title=Skull Wars: Kennewick Man, Archaeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity|year=2001|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0465092253|url=http://books.google.com/?id=IWT4_ZQ2grsC&pg=PR22&dq=Umatilla+creation{{!}}oral+kennewick#v=onepage&q=Umatilla%20creation%7Coral%20kennewick&f=false|edition=Reprint|page=xxii}}</ref> so a government holding that Kennewick Man is not Native American is tantamount to the government's rejection of their religious beliefs.

[[Robson Bonnichsen]] and seven other anthropologists sued the United States for the right to conduct tests on the skeleton.  On February 4, 2004, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] panel rejected the appeal brought by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] and the Umatilla, [[Colville]], [[Yakama]], [[Nez Perce]] and other tribes on the grounds that they were unable to show any evidence of [[kinship]].<ref name=Bonnichsen/>

On April 7, 2005, during the 109th Congress, [[United States Senator]] [[John McCain]] introduced an amendment to NAGPRA which (section 108) would have changed the definition of "Native American" from being that which "is indigenous to the United States" to "is or was indigenous to the United States."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:SN00536:@@@L&summ2=m&|title=S.  536, 109th Cong., Native American Omnibus Act of 2005 (Reported in Senate)|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|year=2005|accessdate = 2008-02-26}}</ref> However, the 109th Congress concluded without enacting the bill.  By the bill's definition, Kennewick Man would have been classified as Native American, regardless of whether any link to a contemporary tribe could be found. Proponents of this definition argue that it agrees with current scientific understanding, which is that it is not in all cases possible for prehistoric remains to be traced to current tribal entities, partly because of social upheaval, forced resettlement and extinction of entire ethnicities caused by disease and warfare. Doing so would still not remove the controversy surrounding Kennewick Man as then it would have to be decided which Native American group should take possession of the remains if he could not be definitively linked with a current tribe. To be of practical use in a historical and prehistorical context, some argue further that the term "Native American" should be applied so that it spans the entire range from the [[Clovis culture]] (which cannot be positively assigned to any contemporary tribal group) to the [[M<U+00E9>tis people (Canada)|M<U+00E9>tis]], a group of mixed ancestry who only came into being as a consequence of European contact, yet constitute a distinct cultural entity.

The remains are now at the [[Burke Museum]] at the [[University of Washington]], where they were deposited in October 1998. They are still legally the property of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as they were found on land under its custody.<ref>http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/kman/</ref>
