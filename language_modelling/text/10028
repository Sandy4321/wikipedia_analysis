The '''Acra''' (alt: '''Akra''', {{lang-he|'''<U+05D7><U+05E7><U+05E8><U+05D0>''' or '''<U+05D7><U+05E7><U+05E8><U+05D4>'''}}, {{lang-el|{{Polytonic|'''A<U+03BA><U+03C1><U+03B1>'''}}}}), was a fortified compound in Seleucid [[Jerusalem]] of the second century BCE. Built by [[Antiochus Epiphanes]], ruler of the [[Seleucid Empire]], after his sacking of the city in 168 BCE, it played a significant role in the events surrounding the [[Maccabean Revolt]] and the formation of the [[Hasmonean Kingdom]].

The Acra is often referred to as the '''Seleucid Acra''' in order to distinguish it from the [[Ptolemaic Baris]], itself sometimes referred to as an Acra.

== History ==
=== Background ===
[[Antiochus III]]'s victory over [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] in the [[Battle of Panium]] brought [[Judea]] under Seleucid control. The [[Jewish]] population of Jerusalem had aided Antiochus during his siege of the Baris, home to the Egyptian garrison of Jerusalem,<ref name="ant2133">[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D12%3Awhiston%20chapter%3D3%3Awhiston%20section%3D3 Flavius Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, 12:133&ndash;138]</ref> and was rewarded with a charter affirming Jewish religious autonomy, including the barring of foreigners and impure animals from the [[Second Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]], and allocating official funds for religious practices in the Temple.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D12%3Awhiston%20chapter%3D3%3Awhiston%20section%3D3 Flavius Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, 12:138&ndash;146]</ref> Despite enjoying religious freedom, however, many Jews were enticed by and followed the prestigious and influential Greek lifestyle. The imperial culture offered a route to political influence and material wealth, and led to the formation of Hellenistic elites among the Jewish population, as well as to growing tensions between observant Jews and their Hellenized brethren.<ref name="goldman">{{cite journal |last1=Goldman |first1=Martin |year=2010 |title=Under the Influence<U+2014>Hellenism in ancient Jewish life |journal=Biblical Archaeology Review |volume=35 |issue=1 |url=http://www.bib-arch.org/bar/article.asp?PubID=BSBA&Volume=36&Issue=1&ArticleID=29 }}</ref>

[[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] ascended to the Seleucid throne in 175 BCE, and was shortly later petitioned by [[Jason (high priest)|Jason]], brother of [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] [[Onias III]], to take his brother's place. Jason, himself thoroughly Hellenized, furthermore promised to enlarge the tribute payed by the city and to establish within it the constituent elements of a Greek [[Polis]], a [[Gymnasium]] and an [[Ephebeum#E|Ephebion]].<ref>[http://st-takla.org/pub_Deuterocanon/Deuterocanon-Apocrypha_El-Asfar_El-Kanoneya_El-Tanya__9-Second-of-Maccabees.html 2 Maccabees 4:7&ndash;9]</ref> Jason's petition was granted, yet after a three year rule he was himself ousted and forced to flee to [[Ammon]].<ref>[http://st-takla.org/pub_Deuterocanon/Deuterocanon-Apocrypha_El-Asfar_El-Kanoneya_El-Tanya__9-Second-of-Maccabees.html 2 Maccabees 4:23,26]</ref>
Antiochus IV, meanwhile, had in 170 and 169 BCE twice invaded Egypt and routed the Ptolemaic armies.<ref>[http://st-takla.org/pub_Deuterocanon/Deuterocanon-Apocrypha_El-Asfar_El-Kanoneya_El-Tanya__9-Second-of-Maccabees.html 2 Maccabees 5:1]</ref><ref>[http://st-takla.org/pub_Deuterocanon/Deuterocanon-Apocrypha_El-Asfar_El-Kanoneya_El-Tanya__8-First-of-Maccabees.html 1 Maccabees 1:16&ndash;19]</ref> Yet Antiochus' victories were short-lived. His intended unification of the Seleucid and Ptolemic kingdoms alarmed the growing power of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and he was directed to withdraw his forces from Egypt.<ref>[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy45.html Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, XLV:12]</ref>
While Antiochus was thus engaged in Egypt, a false rumor spread in Jerusalem that he had been killed. In the subsequent uncertainty, Jason gathered a force of 1,000 followers and attempted to take Jerusalem by storm. Although repulsed, when word of the fighting reached Antiochus in Egypt, the king came to believe that his Judean subjects had sought to exploit his setback to rebel. In 168 BCE, therefore, Antiochus IV Epiphanes marched on Jerusalem and sacked it, looting the temple treasury and killing thousands of its residents.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=Daniel|title=2 Maccabees|publisher=Yad Yitzhak Ben Zvi|location=Jerusalem|year=2004|pages=144|isbn=9652172332|accessdate=March 11, 2010|language=Hebrew}}</ref><ref>[http://st-takla.org/pub_Deuterocanon/Deuterocanon-Apocrypha_El-Asfar_El-Kanoneya_El-Tanya__8-First-of-Maccabees.html 1 Maccabees 1:21&ndash;25]</ref><ref>[http://st-takla.org/pub_Deuterocanon/Deuterocanon-Apocrypha_El-Asfar_El-Kanoneya_El-Tanya__9-Second-of-Maccabees.html 2 Maccabees 5:11&ndash;14]</ref> Reversing his father's policy, Antiochus IV issued decrees outlawing traditional Jewish rites and persecuting observant Jews.

=== Construction of the Acra ===
To consolidate his hold on the city, monitor events on the [[Temple Mount]] and safeguard the Hellenized faction in Jerusalem, Antiochus stationed a Seleucid garrison in the city:<ref name="aehl2" /><ref name="wightman1">{{cite journal|last=Wightman|first=Gregory J.|year=1990|title=Temple Fortresses in Jerusalem Part I: The Ptolemaic and Seleucid Akras|journal=Bulletin of the Anglo-Israeli Archaeological Society|volume=9|pages=29<U+2013>40}}</ref>

{{cquote|And they built the city of David with a great and strong wall, and with strong towers, and made it a fortress [Greek: ''Acra''] for them: And they placed there a sinful nation, wicked men, and they fortified themselves therein: and they stored up armour, and victuals, and gathered together the spoils of Jerusalem; And laid them up there: and they became a great snare.

The Acra, a name derived from the Greek [[acropolis]] and signifying a fortified high place overlooking a town, came to be a symbol of anti-Jewish paganism, a fortress of the "impious and wicked".<ref name="wightman1" /> Dominating both the city and the surrounding countryside, it was populated not only by a Greek garrison but by their Jewish allies as well.<ref name="sievers">{{cite book|last=Sievers|first=Joseph|title=Josephus and the History of the Greco-Roman Period|editor=Parente & Sievers|publisher=Brill|year=1994|pages=195<U+2013>208|chapter=Jerusalem, The Akra, and Josephus|isbn=9789004101142}}</ref>

Seleucid steps met with considerable resistance among the Jewish population, and in 167 BCE a rural priest, [[Mattathias]] of [[Modiin]], led a rebellion against the empire<ref>{{cite book|last=Rocca|first=Samuel|title=The Forts of Judaea 168 BC &ndash; AD 73|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Oxford|year=2008|pages=4|isbn=9781846031717}}</ref> while Antiochus was occupied in the East. Both the Seleucid administration and the local Hellenized faction failed to grasp the magnitude of the revolt. In 164 BCE [[Judas Maccabaeus]] liberated Jerusalem and reconsecrated the Temple. The Acra and its inhabitants, however, still held out, and when Maccabaeus placed them under siege, they appealed to the Seleucid king, now [[Antiochus V]], for assistance. When the newly-arrived Seleucid army laid siege to [[Beth-Zur]], Maccabaeus was forced to abandon his siege of the Acra and face Antiochus in battle. In the subsequent [[Battle of Beth-zechariah]], the Seleucids enjoyed their first victory over the [[Maccabees]] and Maccabaeus was forced to withdraw.<ref>[http://www.livius.org/maa-mam/maccabees/1macc06.html 1 Maccabees 6:18&ndash;47]</ref> Thus spared from capitulation, the Acra persisted as a Seleucid stronghold for 20 more years, weathering several [[Hasmonean]] attempts to oust the Greek garrison.<ref name="wightman1" />

=== Destruction ===

Judas was killed in 160 BCE and succeeded by his brother, [[Jonathan Maccabeus]], who sought to construct a barrier cutting off the Acra's supply line.<ref name="deque" /> Jonathan had already assembled the manpower required for the task when he was forced to confront the invading army of [[Diodotus Tryphon]] at [[Beit She'an|Beth Shan (Scythopolis)]].<ref>[http://www.livius.org/maa-mam/maccabees/1macc12.html 1 Maccabees 12:37&ndash;41]</ref> Inviting Jonathan for a friendly conference, Tryphon had him seized and murdered.<ref>[http://www.livius.org/maa-mam/maccabees/1macc12.html 1 Maccabees 12:48]</ref> Jonathan was succeeded by another brother, [[Simon Maccabeus]], who besieged and finally subdued the Acra in 141 BCE.

Two sources provide information about the ultimate fate of the Acra, though their accounts are at times contradictory.
According to Josephus, after ousting its inhabitants, Simon razed the Acra and then quarried the hill on which it had stood to render it lower than the temple, purge the city of its evil memory and deny it to any future occupier of Jerusalem.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D13%3Awhiston%20chapter%3D6%3Awhiston%20section%3D7 Flavius Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, 13:215&ndash;217]</ref>

The account appearing in [[1 Maccabees]] paints a different picture:

{{cquote|And Simon decreed that every year they should celebrate this day with rejoicing. He strengthened the fortifications of the temple hill alongside the citadel [Greek: ''Acra''], and he and his men dwelt there.|||1 Maccabees 13:52.<ref>[http://www.livius.org/maa-mam/maccabees/1macc13.html 1 Maccabees 13:52]</ref>}}

Simon, therefore, did not demolish the Acra but rather populated it, and may have even resided in it himself. 1 Maccabees, however, does not mention its ultimate fate. It had been built to exercise control of the Jerusalem and its population, yet if situated in the [[City of David]], as most scholars agree, its location offered very little to the defence of Jerusalem against an external threat. It may have fallen out of use and taken apart when the [[Hasmonean Baris]] and Hasmonean Palace were built in Jerusalem's upper city, around the end of the second century BCE.<ref name="deque" />

[[Bezalel Bar-Kochva]] offers a different theory: The Acra was still standing in 139 BCE when [[Antiochus VII Sidetes]] demanded it back from Simon, along with [[Jaffa]] and [[Gezer]], two Hellenized cities Simon had captured.<ref>[http://www.livius.org/maa-mam/maccabees/1macc15.html 1 Maccabees 15:28]</ref> Simon was willing to discuss the two cities but made no mention of the Acra.<ref>[http://www.livius.org/maa-mam/maccabees/1macc15.html 1 Maccabees 15:32&ndash;35]</ref> It was at this point that he must have sealed the its fate, as a way to deny the Seleucids any future claim or hold on Jerusalem. Thus, when Antiochus VII subdued the city during [[Hyrcanus I]]'s reign, each and every one of his demands were met<U+2014>except the one demanding the stationing of a Seleucid garrison in the city.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D13%3Awhiston%20chapter%3D8%3Awhiston%20section%3D3 Flavius Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, 13:247]</ref> Hyrcanus may have been able to reject, and Antiochus to drop, this demand because there was nowhere to billet the garrison<U+2014>the Acra was probably no longer standing. This places the razing of the Acra somewhere in the 130s BCE.<ref name="kochva">{{cite book|last=Bar-Kochva|first=Bezalel|title=Judas Maccabeus|publisher=Cambridge|year=1989|pages=445<U+2013>465|url=http://books.google.co.il/books?id=SIKuW_bl6LAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=bezalel+bar+kochva&cd=6#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}</ref>

== Location ==
[[Image:Map of jerusalem 1903.jpg|thumb|right|240px|alt=an old map superimposing historical features in relationship to the then-current walled Old City of Jerusalem with the southeast ridge labeled as, Akra or Lower City|1903 map of Jerusalem, identifying the Acra with the entire south eastern hill.]]

The most detailed description of the nature and location of the Acra is found in [[Josephus]]' [[Antiquities of the Jews]], where it is described as residing in the lower city, upon a hill overlooking the Temple enclosure:

{{cquote|... and when he had overthrown the city walls, he built a citadel [Greek: Acra] in the lower part of the city, for the place was high, and overlooked the temple; on which account he fortified it with high walls and towers, and put into it a garrison of Macedonians. However, in that citadel dwelt the impious and wicked part of the multitude, from whom it proved that the citizens suffered many and sore calamities.|||Flavius Josephus|Antiquities of the Jews 12:252&ndash;253<ref name="josephus252">[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D12%3Awhiston%20chapter%3D5%3Awhiston%20section%3D4 Flavius Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, 12:252&ndash;253]</ref>}}

The location of the "lower part of the city", elsewhere referred to as the "lower city", at the time of Josephus (first century CE) is accepted to be Jerusalem's south-eastern hill, the city's original urban center traditionally known as the [[City of David]]. Lying to the south of the Temple Mount, however, this area is significantly lower that the mount itself. 30 meters separate the top of the Mount from ground level at the southern wall of the Temple enclosure and the ground only slopes further down from there.<ref name="wightman1" /> Josephus, a native of Jerusalem,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/306479/Flavius-Josephus|title=Flavius Josephus|last=Poole|first=Gary William|work=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica|accessdate=19 March 2010}}</ref> would have been well aware of this discrepancy, yet is nevertheless able to explain it away by describing how Simon had razed both the Acra and the hill on which it had stood. Archaeological research south of the Temple Mount, however, has failed to locate any evidence for such large scale quarrying.<ref name="wightman1" /> On the contrary, excavations in the region have uncovered substantial evidence of habitation from the beginning of the first millennium BCE down to Roman times,<ref name="eilat">{{cite book|last=Mazar|first=Eilat|title=The Complete Guide to the Temple Mount Excavations|publisher=Shoham Academic Research and Publication|location=Jerusalem|year=2002|pages=3<U+2013>73|isbn=9659029918}}</ref> casting doubt on an account that suggests that during Hellenistic times the area was significantly higher than it was at the time of Josephus or that a large hill had been cleared away.<ref name="kochva" /> This had led many researchers to disregard Josephus' account and his placing of the Acra, and suggest several alternate locations.<ref name="sievers" /> Since 1841, when [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]] suggested the area near the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] as the location of the Acra, at least 9 different locations in and around the [[Old City of Jerusalem]] have been proposed.<ref name="tsafrir">{{cite journal|last=Tsafrir|first=Yoram|year=1980|title=The Location of the Seleucid Akra in Jerusalem|journal=Cathedra|publisher=Yad Yizthak Ben-Zvi|location=Jerusalem|language=Hebrew|volume=14|pages=17<U+2013>40|url=http://www.ybz.org.il/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/cathedra14.pdf}}</ref>

=== Western hill ===
Several researchers have attempted to place the Acra in the Upper City, on Jerusalem's western hill, within the area currently occupied by the old city's [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]].<ref name="kochva" /><ref name="tsafrir" /><ref name="shotwell">{{cite journal|last=Shotwell|first=W.A.|year=1964|title=The Problem of the Syrian Akra|journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|volume=176|pages=10<U+2013>19}}</ref> These propositions seek to locate the Acra within ''Antiochia'', the Hellenistic polis supposedly established in Jerusalem according to [[2 Maccabees]]. This supposedly new city would have been [[Hippodamic]] in plan, and therefore would have required a flat expanse of land, which only the western hill would have been able to provide.<ref name="tsafrir" /> Furthermore, the eastern edge of the hill is adjacent to the Temple Mount and higher in altitude, two characteristics attributed to the Seleucid citadel.<ref name="shotwell" /> 

Opponents of this proposed location point out that there is very little evidence, archaeological or historical, for the establishment of a Hellenistic Polis in the city, let alone on the western hill which appears to have been only sparsely populated during Jerusalem's Hellenistic period. Excavations in the Jewish Quarter display evidence of habitation from the [[First Temple Period]], as well as a renewed [[Hasmonean]] and [[Herod the Great|Herodian]] settlement, yet scant evidence of Hellenistic occupation.<ref name="aehl2" /><ref name="tsafrir" /> Research into the disperal of stamped [[Rhodian]] [[amphorae]] handles has revealed that over 95% of the handles found in Jerusalem were excavated in the City of David, indicating the city had not yet expanded to the western hill during Seleucid rule.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Finkielsztejn|first=Gerald|year=1999|title=The Evidence of the Rhodian Amphora Stamps|journal=New Studies on Jerusalem|volume=5}}</ref> Furthermore, the western hill is separated from the [[Temple Mount]] by the steep [[Tyropoeon Valley]], a distinct tactical disadvantage for any force that may been required to intervene in events within the temple precinct.<ref name="shotwell" />

=== North of the Temple ===

The Acra was not the first Hellenistic citadel in Jerusalem. Sources indicate that an earlier citadel, the [[Ptolemaic Baris]], had also occupied a location overlooking the temple. Although its location as well is still a matter of debate, it is generally accepted to have stood north of the Temple Mount, at the site later occupied by the [[Antonia Fortress]].<ref name="wightman1" /> The Baris, which fell to Antiochus III at the turn of the second century BCE, however, is missing from all accounts of Maccabean Revolt.<ref name="kochva" /> On the other hand, while the Acra was supposedly built within a very short timespan, it was nevertheless formidable enough to weather long periods of siege. Coupled with the fact that the Baris was itself often referred to as an ''Acra'',<ref name="ant2133" /> this had led to the suggestion than the Baris and the Acra were in fact one and the same. Although both 1 Maccabees and Josephus supposedly describe the Acra as a new construction, this may not have actually been the case. [[Antiquities of the Jews]] 12:253 can be translated as meaning the "impious or wicked" had "remained" rather than "dwelt" in the citadel, indicating the Acra had been standing before the revolt and that only the Macedonian garrison was new.<ref name="loria">{{cite journal|last=Loria|first=Ben-Zion|year=1981|title=The Location of the Akra <U+2014> North of the Temple Mount|journal=Cathedra|publisher=Yad Yizthak Ben-Zvi|location=Jerusalem|language=Hebrew|volume=18|pages=31<U+2013>40|url=http://www.ybz.org.il/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/cathedra21.1.pdf}}</ref>

[[Koen Decoster]] proposes that Josephus wrote of "a citadel in the lower part of the city" to an audience that would have been familiar with the Jerusalem of the first century CE, a city that did feature two citadels: the Antonia Fortress and the Herodian palace. As Josephus' Roman Jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill, "a citadel in the lower city" could have referred to anything located east of the Tyropoeon Valley, including the Antonia which stood north of the Temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it. This is the place Josephus must have had in mind when he wrote of the Acra.<ref name="decoster">{{cite journal|last=Decoster|first=Koen|year=1989|title=Flavius Josephus and the Seleucid Acra in Jerusalem|journal=ZDPV|volume=105|pages=70<U+2013>84}}</ref>

Opponents of a northern location counter that not only is it unsupported by the available sources, but this places the Acra away from Jerusalem's population center. Unlike it predecessor and successor citadels, it was not meant as a defence against external threat, but rather to oversee the inhabited Jewish parts of the city, a role incompatible with a proposed northern location.<ref name="kochva" />

=== A fortified compound in the City of David ===

The available sources do indicate the Acra stood south of the temple, and as the composition of 1 Maccabees is contemporaneous with the events of the Maccabean revolt, its account of the Acra (1:35&ndash;38) is considered the most reliable.<ref name="wightman1" /> Josephus provides an unlikely account of the razing of a hill on which it had stood, yet his description of the end of the [[Great Revolt]] (70 AD) provides additional evidence for a southern location:

{{cquote|... but on the next day they set fire to the repository of the archives, to Acra, to the council-house, and to the place called Ophlas; at which time the fire proceeded as far as the palace of queen [[Helena of Adiabene|Helena]], which was in the middle of Acra;|||Flavius Josephus|[[The Jewish War]] 6:354<ref name="josephus354">[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0148%3Abook%3D6%3Asection%3D351 Flavius Josephus, The Jewish War, 6:354]</ref>}}

As the rest of the buildings mentioned in the account all stood in the lower city, this also places the Acra there. However, this account, attesting to the persistance of the name "Acra" for this part of Jerusalem many years after Hellenistic rule was over and its citadels long gone, can be seen as referring not to a distinct building but rather to an entire region of the city. Indeed, several clauses in 1 Maccabees may be read as making a similar point:

{{cquote|About five hundred men of the army of [[Nicanor (Seleucid general)|Nicanor]] fell, and the rest fled into the city of David.|||1 Maccabees 7:32.<ref>[http://www.livius.org/maa-mam/maccabees/1macc07.html 1 Maccabees 7:32]</ref>}}
{{cquote|And in his days things prospered in his hands, so that the Gentiles were put out of the country, as were also the men in the city of David in Jerusalem, who had built themselves a citadel [Greek: Acra] from which they used to sally forth and defile the environs of the sanctuary and do great damage to its purity.|||1 Maccabees 14:36.<ref>[http://www.livius.org/maa-mam/maccabees/1macc14.html 1 Maccabees 14:36]</ref>}} 

These suggest that after the sacking of Jerusalem by Antiochus IV in 168 BCE, the City of David or at least a part of it was rebuilt as a fortified Hellenistic quarter of Jerusalem.<ref name="wightman1" /> More than a citadel, it was a Macedonian colony where Jewish renegades and supporters of the new regime lived.<ref name="deque" /> This is also supported by archaeological evidence such as the dispersal of Rhodian amphorae handles and 18 box graves found on the eastern slope of the City of David. The latter are dated to the early second century CE are uncharacteristic of [[Second Temple]] era Jewish burial practices, yet similar to other known Hellenistic graveyards such as the one in [[Acre (Israel)|Acre (Ptolemais)]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=De-Groot|first=Alon|year=2004|title=Jerusalem in the Early Hellenistic Period|journal=New Studies on Jerusalem |volume=10|language=Hebrew}}</ref>

=== A citadel nevertheless ===

{{FixBunching|end}}
Even were the name "Acra" applied to a Hellenistic quarter rather than a mere citadel, there certainly did stand a citadel within this compound, if only for the need to billet the Macedonian garrison.<ref name="kochva" /> It was normal for a Hellenistic city to have a fortified citadel at or near the highest point of its walled area.<ref name="sievers" /> Thus, whether a part of a larger enclave or independent of its surroundings, there probably did stand a citadel at the northern tip of the City of David, just south of the Temple Mount. Archaeologists have tried to use the archaeological excavations in the area to pin-point its precise location.

[[Yoram Tsafrir]] has attempted to place the Acra underneath the southestern corner of the Temple Mount enclosure. Tsafrir points to a vertical seam, a straight joint, in the enclosure's eastern wall as evidence of different periods of construction.

[[Meir Ben-Dov]] places the Acra just south of the [[Huldah Gates]] in the southern wall of the Herodian platform. [[Benjamin Mazar]]'s excavations of the [[Ophel]], the area adjoining the southern portion of the platform, have unearthed the foundations of a massive structure and a large cistern, both possibly dating to the Hellenistic period. These have been tentatively identified as remnants of the Acra, with the structure, featuring rows of small interconnected rooms, believed to be the remains of a barracks. These were demolished and built-over during the [[Hasmonean]] period, matching the descriptions in Josephus. The Hasmonean constructions were, in turn, demolished to create a public square fronting the main gates to the Temple platform during the Herodian renovations.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ben-Don|first=Meir|year=1981|title=The Seleucid Akra <U+2014> South of the Temple Mount|journal=Cathedra|publisher=Yad Yizthak Ben-Zvi|location=Jerusalem|language=Hebrew|volume=18|pages=22<U+2013>35|url=http://www.ybz.org.il/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/cathedra18.1.pdf}}</ref><ref>Ben-Dov, Meir (1985).

Several cisterns under the Temple Mount itself have also been proposed as possible remnants of the Seleucid citadel. These include a {{convert|700000|impgal}} cistern shaped like an E and whose northern edge is adjacent to the proposed southern line of the Temple Mount precinct before its Herodian expansion.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ritmeyer|first=Leen|date=Mar/Apr 1992|title=Locating the Original Temple Mount|journal=Biblical Archaeology Review |location=Washington|volume=18|issue=2|url=http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBA&Volume=18&Issue=2&ArticleID=1}}</ref> This has been identified as the "be'er haqar" or "bor heqer" mentioned in the [[Mishnah]], Erubin Tract 10.14,<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/etm/etm057.htm Treatise Erubin X]</ref> and commonly translated, perhaps incorrectly, as the "cold well".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schwartz |first=Joshua|year=1986|title=Be'er Haqar, Bor Heqer and the Seleucid Akra|journal=Cathedra|publisher=Yad Yizthak Ben-Zvi|location=Jerusalem|language=Hebrew|volume=37|pages=3<U+2013>16|url=http://www.ybz.org.il/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/cathedra37.1.pdf}}</ref>

Additional evidence for the existence of the Acra may come from a fragmentary Greek inscription discovered by chance in the rubble of an Arab house in the old city of Jerusalem and published by [[Shimon Appelbaum]]. The upper fragment of a sandstone stele, the inscription may contain an oath taken by soldiers stationed in the Acra, though the reading of the name "Acra" has been contentious.<ref name="aehl2" /><ref>{{cite book|title=Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum|editor=Pleket H.W. and Stroud R.S. |publisher=Brill|year=1980|volume=XXX|pages=482<U+2013>484|isbn=9789004164956}}</ref>
