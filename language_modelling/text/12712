'''St Andrew's Church, Plymouth''' is an [[Anglican]] church in [[Plymouth]]. It is the original parish church of Sutton, one of the three towns which were later combined to form the city of Plymouth. The church is the largest parish church in the historic county of [[Devon]] and was built in the mid to late 15th century. It was designated as a Minster Church in 1999.

It is likely to be on the site of the original Saxon church and was once attached to the abbey of [[Plympton]].

==Description==

The church existed at least as early as the beginning of the 12th century but by the 15th century it needed to be enlarged because of the growth of the town. The building can be dated approximately as between 1430 and 1490.<ref>Nikolaus Pevsner</ref> It has been restored three times, in 1824 by [[John Foulston]] and again by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott|G. G. Scott]] in 1875. It was badly damaged in [[World War II]] and afterwards repaired (architect (Sir) [[Frederick Etchells]]). The Resurgam Door is a commemoration of this. The length is {{Convert|185|ft}} and the width {{Convert|96|ft}}. There are two aisles on each side of the [[nave]] and one each side of the [[chancel]]. The arcades are of the type which is standard in [[Cornwall]] at the period. The tower is {{Convert|136|ft}} high and was funded by Thomas Yogge, a prosperous merchant, {{Circa|1460}}.<ref>Pevsner, N. (1952); pp. 229-30</ref>

The organ is very large, in fact the largest west of Bristol, and was built by Rushworth and Dreaper to a design by George Harry Moreton, William Lloyd Webber and O. H. Peasgood. Dr Harry Moreton (1864-1961) was the organist of St Andrew's from 1885 to 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouthdata.info/PP-MoretonHarry.htm|title=Doctor Harry Moreton|publisher=PlymouthData|accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref>

==Blitz==

In March 1941, St Andrew's Parish Church was bombed and badly damaged. Amidst the smoking ruins a headmistress nailed over the door a wooden sign saying simply ''Resurgam'' (Latin for ''I shall rise again''), indicating the wartime spirit, a gesture repeated at other devastated European churches. That entrance to St Andrew's is still referred to as the "Resurgam" door and a carved granite plaque is now permanently fixed there.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.plymouth.gov.uk/placesofworship |work=Plymouth City Council website |title=Places of Worship |accessdate=2007-10-13}}</ref>

The Church was re-roofed and restored by (Sir) Frederick Etchells and re-consecrated on November 30th, 1957, St Andrew's Day. The restoration includes a new chancel as the old one had been made into a ruin.
