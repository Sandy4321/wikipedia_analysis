'''Roxanne Ellis''' ([[November 4]], [[1942]] - [[December 4]], [[1995]]) and '''Michelle Abdill''' ([[July 8]], [[1953]] - [[December 4]], [[1995]]) were a [[lesbian]] couple, murdered in [[Medford, Oregon]] by [[Robert Acremant]]. Before and during his trial, Acremant stated that the crime was partially motivated by  couple's lesbianism.

==Background==

In [[1990]] Michelle Abdill and Rhonda Ellis moved from [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], which they felt was becoming increasingly hostile to [[gays]] and [[lesbians]], to [[Medford, Oregon]] where they hoped the small town setting would give them a chance to start over and find acceptance. The couple met [[Colorado]], where Ellis &mdash; divorced with two children &mdash; worked as an obstetrics nurse. Abdill got a job in the same doctors office, and they eventually became [[life-partner]]s.<ref name='Burness'>{{cite news |first=Charles |last=Burness |title=Confessed Stockton Slayer Tells Motive |date=[[1996-08-22]] |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1996/08/22/MN50950.DTL&hw=roxanne+ellis&sn=004&sc=740 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate = 2007-07-31}}</ref>

The couple started a successful property management business, and were elected to the board of their church. They spent their spare time restoring their old [[American Craftsman|Craftsman-style]] house, visiting Ellis' 3-year-old granddaughter. They also worked as activists, fighting two Oregon state ballot initiatives in [[1992]] and [[1993]]; [[Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (1992)|Measure 9]] intended to amend the state constitution to declare [[homosexuality]] "abnormal, wrong, unnatural and perverse," and [[Oregon Ballot Measure 19 (1994)|Measure 19]]  intended to restrict library access to materials related to [[homosexuality]]. 

At the time of their murders, Ellis and Abdill had been together for 12 years.

==The Murders==

On [[December 4]], [[1995]], Ellis went to an appointment with 27-year-old Robert Acremant. to show him an apartment. Police believed the appointment was made earlier that day. Ellis failed to return several pages from her daughter, Lorri, during the day, and allegedly called at 4:00 p.m. to tell Lorri she was going shopping. 

Abdill left the office a 5:00 p.m. saying that she was leaving to help Ellis jump start car, after receiving a call that the car would not start. Later, Ellis' daughter drove over to the apartment complex where her mother was going to show the apartment, and saw her mother's pickup, but said it pulled away from her when she tried to follow it.<ref name='Burness' />

Ellis and Abdill were not seen again until their bodies were discovered four days later in the back of Ellis' pickup truck by a cable TV worker who reported the vehicle to police.<ref name='NYT'>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Gay Rights Leaders Missing, Found Dead | date=[[1995-12-10]] | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E5DE1639F933A25751C1A963958260 | work =The New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-31 | language = }}</ref> The women were bound and gagged.

==Publicity & Arrest==

The discovery of Ellis' and Abdill's bodies caused concern in the local [[gay community]]. The couple's activism on [[gay rights]] issues, and records of an earlier threat against them, roused suspicion that they had fallen victim to a [[hate crime]]. The[[ National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]] wrote to Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] to request that the [[Department of Justice]] assist local authorities in their investigation. The letter cited the Justice Department's guidelines, which said a crime motivated by bias "in whole or in part" should be considred a [[hate crime]].<ref name='Reno'>{{cite news |first=David |last=Tuller |title=Reno Asked to Investigate Slaying of Lesbians |date=[[1995-12-21]] |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/12/21/MN44602.DTL&hw=roxanne+ellis&sn=009&sc=405 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate = 2007-07-31}}</ref>

The nature of the crime, and the couple's activism, led to widespread publicity about the case. Police publicized a composite sketch of the suspect, based on a description of a witness who'd seen a man &mdash; Acremant &mdash; park Ellis' truck and walk away.<ref name='Court' />

The media coverage of the murders reach Acremant's mother, who had moved to Medford three weeks earlier with her son. Believing her son had committed the murders, Acremant's mother called a police tip line and told police of her suspicion, based on her son's behavior and his resemblance to the composite sketch.<ref name='LATimes'>{{cite news |first=Kim |last=Murphy |title=No Place to Rest |date=[[1995-12-10]] |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/22491409.html?dids=22491409:22491409&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Dec+20%2C+1995&author=KIM+MURPHY&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&edition=&startpage=1&desc=No+Place+to+Rest |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>  She  also showed police the labels of cardboard boxes used during her move to Medford with Acremant. Police matched  the address labels to those on the boxes used to cover the bodies of Ellis and Abdill.<ref name='Court' />

She later told ''The Oregonian'', "I called the police because I have to look God in the face. I will do anything in my power to make sure other people aren't hurt. But right now, he's sick."<ref name='Times2'>{{cite news |title=Robbery Cited In Killings of 2 Lesbians |date=[[1995-12-15]] |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60C15FC3C5D0C768DDDAB0994DD494D81 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>

Police contacted [[California]] authorities and found that Acremant was under investigation there in the [[October 3]] disappearance of one of his friends.  Acremant was then tracked down to a Stockton motel room and arrested on [[December 13]], [[1995]]

Upon arrest, Acremant confessed to the Ellis and Abdill murders, claiming his motive was robbery. After they refused to write checks off their property management business, Acremant shot both women [[execution-style]], each in the back of her head, after binding and gagging them with duct tape, and forcing them to lie down in the back of Ellis' pickup. <ref name='Court' />

Acremant also confessed to killing Scott George of [[Visalia, California]], on [[October 3]], [[1995]], and dumping his body down a mineshafton his father's property. After Acremant told his father where he'd hidden the body, police found what was believed to be George's body at the bottom of a mineshaft outside Acremant's father's ranch in [[Stockton, California|Stockton]].<ref name='LATimes' />

==Robert Acremant==

Robert Acremant served in the [[Air Force]] and earned a [[Masters Degree]] in [[Business Administration]] from  [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco's]] [[Golden Gate University]], in half the time usually required. Later, he worked as a district operations manager at [[Roadway Trucking]] in Los Angeles.<ref name='Houston'>{{cite news | first=Steven | last=Chi | coauthors= | title=Shooting Called 'American Way' | date=[[1995-12-18]] | publisher= | url =http://www.performative.com/hosts/hateCrimes/abdillEllis/articles.html#7 | work =The Houston Chronicle | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-31 | language = }}</ref>    

Acremant left his job at [[Roadway|Roadway Trucking]], to start his own software business, because he felt he would not get ahead at Roadway. He became frustrated by the failure of his software company<ref name='MailTrib'>{{cite news | first=Charles | last=Briggs | coauthors= | title=Death sentence upheald for lesbian couple's killer | date=[[2005-03-18]]] | publisher= | url =http://archive.mailtribune.com/archive/2005/0318/local/stories/12local.htm | work =The Mail Tribune | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-31 | language = }}</ref>, and his own failure to find a job and achieve financial security.<ref name='Houston'>{{cite news | first=Steven | last=Chi | coauthors= | title=Shooting Called 'American Way' | date=[[1995-12-18]] | publisher= | url =http://www.performative.com/hosts/hateCrimes/abdillEllis/articles.html#7 | work =The Houston Chronicle | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-31 | language = }}</ref>

His money frustrations were compounded by depression when he was rejected by a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] [[stripper]]  named Alla Kosova, whom he considered to be his [[girlfriend]], because he didn't have enough money to visit here in [[Las Vegas|Las Vegas]].<ref name='LATimes' />

==Motives==

===Robbery===
Acremant's statements about his motive have shifted over time. He has said that his intention was to rob Ellis and Abdill. Media reports said the robbery scheme was part of plan get enough money  to win back Kosova. 

However, the district attorney in the case noted  that some of the evidence undermines robbery as the only motive, as Acremont left the victims' purses, wallets, jewelry, cell phones and money at the scene. When Ellis' daughter arrived at the complex, she and Abdill's brother -- Dan Abdil -- spotted  Abdill's unlocked vehicle at the scene, with her purse in plain view, which prompted them to call the police.<ref name="LATimes" />

===Homophobia===

In [[August 1996]] Acremant wrote a letter his hometown newspaper the [[Stockton Record]] stating that he had intended to rob Ellis and Abdill, and that knowing they were lesbians made it easier to kill them. He also wrote that he had killed Scott Gordon, who was reportedly [[bisexual]], made a pass at him. Acremant also claimed tobe a victim of childhood sexual abuse.

In his three page letter, Acremant claimed he invented the robbery motive because he feared reactions from inmates who might learn that his murders were "hate crimes against bi- and homosexuals." 

In an interview with the [[Stockton Record]] from his jail cell Acremant said he had no problem with [[bisexual]] women but had "no compassion" for lesbians, bisexual or gay men."<ref name='Burness' />

Interviews and media reports confirm that Acremant knew the couple were lesbians. He had previous contact with with Ellis two weeks before the murders, when he had been shown the same apartment where hem met Ellis on [[December 4]], [[1995]].<ref name="Times2" />

Acremant also acknowledged that he had asked Ellis -- the victim with whom he spend the most time -- if they were lesbians and she said they were.<ref name='Reno' />

Interviews indicated he may have spent some of the time before Abdill's arrival asking Ellis about details of their life. In an interview with [[The Oregonian]] he said it made him "sick to my stomach" to learn that she was "someone's grandma."   In an interview with [[The San Francisco Examiner]] he revealed that he knew Acremant was 54 years old, and that she and Ellis had been together for 12 years.<ref name='LATimes' />

Acremant also told the Oregonian that there was a common thread to the Ellis and Abdill murders, and that of Scott George.<ref name='LATimes' />

Acremant later recanted his earlier claim to have killed Ellis and Abdill because of their [[sexual orientation]]. He attributed his murders of Abdill and Ellis, as well as George, to a "sudden urge, claiming that he he hadn't felt like killing Ellis and Abdill until he'd bound and gagged them and forced  them to lie down in the back of Ellis' truck. He also claimed to have killed George because he wanted to test the silencer he'd just built for his handgun.<ref name='Houston' />

====Alla Kosova====

At Acremant's trial in [[2997]], 24-year--old Kosova testified at Acremant's trial that she had indeed cut off their relationship, which began in April 1995, in August of the same year. She confirmed that they had a relationship, but said that it was purely financial in nature as far as she was concerned. 

Kosova said that Acremant spent up to $3000 a weekend on her at the club where she worked, had bought her two pairs of diamond earrings, and occasionally took her out to dinner. But they never had sex.

Their relationship ended when Acremant, who was not working, spent his savings, used up his retirement fund, and maxed-out his credit cards. When Acremant called her and claimed that a man in New York had stolen his money and he had none left, Kosova said she changed her number and severed ties with Acremant.

Aremant surfaced again in Kosova's life when he returned to Las Vegas after the murders of Ellis and Abdill. Acremant spent $5000 from the sale of his car paying women to dance for Kosova, which she said was a fantasy of his.

After taking her to dinner on [[December 10]], Kosova said Acremant pulled  out a gun and a stun gun as they sat in her truck, and told her he had killed three people; two just that week. He unscrewed the silencer on the gun and showed her the blood inside. 

Later, Kosova told a police officer who was a customer at the club what Acremant told her about the murders, but said he didn't take her seriously. 

Afterward, she told Acremant they were through. But after his arrest, the television program [[Inside Edition]] paid for Kosova to visit Acremant in the [[Jackson County, Oregon|Jackson County]] jail, for what she told him was "the final time." <ref name='Kosova'>{{cite news | first=Danni | last=Dodge | coauthors= | title=Acremant Fooled in Love | date=[[1997-10-15]] | publisher= | url =http://archive.mailtribune.com/archive/97/oct/101597n2.htm | work =The Mail Tribune | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-31 | language = }}</ref>

Kosova would return to television in [[September 2005]] as Alla Wartenberg, a successful business woman and  contestant during the fourth season of the television show [[The Apprentice (US Season 4)|The Apprentice]].<ref name='TSG'> {{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0912051alla1.html |title="Apprentice" Wannabe's X-Rated Past |accessdate=2007-07-31 |date=2005-09-12] |work=The Smoking Gun }}</ref>

==Guilty Plea & Death Penalty==

Upon his arrest, Acremant declared that he wished to be executed by [[lethal injection]]. One month later he entered a not guilty plea and his lawyers filed motions to overturn [[Oregon|Oregon's]] [[death penalty]].<ref name='Burness' /> 

On  [[September 11,]] [[1996]], Acremant pleaded guilty to the murders of Ellis and Abdill.

On October 27, 1997, an [[Oregon]] [[jury]] sentenced Acremant to death by  [[lethal injection]] for the murders of Roxanne Ellis and Michelle Abdill.<ref name='Court' />

On [[March 15]] [[2005]] Oregon's high court upheld Acreamant's death sentence. <ref name='Advocate'>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Ore. high court: Lesbians' killer must die | date=[[2005-03-17]] | publisher=PlanetOut News | url =http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2005/03/17/4 | work =Gay.Com | pages = | accessdate = 2007-07-31 | language = }}</ref>
