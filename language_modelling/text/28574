'''''View of the World from 9th Avenue''''' (sometimes '''''A [[parochialism|Parochial]] New Yorker's View of the World''''', '''''A New Yorker's View of the World''''' or simply '''''View of the World''''') is a 1976 illustration by [[Saul Steinberg]] that served as the cover of the March 29, 1976 edition of ''[[The New Yorker]]''. The work presents the view from [[Manhattan]] of the rest of the world showing Manhattan as the center of the world.

''View of the World'' has been parodied by [[Ted Rall]], [[Columbia Pictures]], ''The New Yorker'', ''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[Mad Magazine]]'', among others. The work has been imitated and printed without authorization in a variety of ways. The Columbia parody led to a ruling by the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] in ''[[Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.]]'' in favor of Steinberg because of [[copyright]] violations by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The work is regarded as one of the greatest magazine covers of all-time and is studied by art students around the world.

==Background==
Saul Steinberg created 85 covers and 642 internal drawings and illustrations for ''The New Yorker'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/14/news/mn-37147|title=Saul Steinberg; Artist Best Known for Covers and Cartoons in the New Yorker|accessdate=2012-10-04|date=1999-05-14|author=Woo, Elaine|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> including its March 29, 1976 cover, titled "View of the World from [[Ninth Avenue (Manhattan)|9th Avenue]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.condenaststore.com/-sp/The-New-Yorker-Cover-View-of-the-World-from-9th-Avenue-March-29-1976-Prints_i8553097_.htm|title=The New Yorker Cover, View of the World from 9th Avenue|accessdate=2012-10-04|date=1976-03-29|publisher=[[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications|Cond<U+00E9> Nast]] and Art.com, Inc.}}</ref> This is regarded as his most famous work.

==Detail==
The illustration is split in two parts, with the bottom half of the image showing [[Manhattan]]'s 9th Avenue, [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|10th Avenue]], and the [[Hudson River]] (appropriately labeled), and the top half depicting the rest of the world. It is a westward view over 10th Avenue.  The rest of the United States is the size of the three New York City blocks and is drawn as a rectangle bounded by North American neighbors [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]], with a thin brown strip along the Hudson representing [[New Jersey|"Jersey"]], the names of five cities ([[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]; [[Washington, D.C.]]; [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]; [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]; and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]) and three states ([[Texas]], [[Utah]], and [[Nebraska]]) scattered among a few rocks for the United States beyond New Jersey, which is in bolder font than the rest of the country beyond the Hudson. Washington, D.C. is depicted as a remote location near Mexico. The Pacific Ocean, perhaps half again as wide as the Hudson, separates the United States from three flattened land masses labeled China, Japan and Russia. Notably, the image depicts the world with a back turned to [[Europe]], which is absent from the painting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/72-the-world-as-seen-from-new-yorks-9th-avenue|title=72 - The World As Seen From New York's 9th Avenue |accessdate=2012-10-04|date=2007-02-07|work=big think|author=Jacobs, Frank}}</ref>

The work is composed in ink, pencil, [[colored pencil]], and [[watercolor]] on paper and measures {{convert|28|x|19|in|cm}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saulsteinbergfoundation.org/gallery_24_viewofworld.html|title=View of the World from 9th Avenue, 1976|accessdate=2012-10-04|publisher=SaulSteinbergFoundation.org}}</ref> When exhibiting this work along with alternate versions and sketches, the [[University of Pennsylvania]] summarized the work as a "bird's-eye view of the city from Ninth Avenue in a straight line westward, with space becoming ever more condensed..."

==Parodies==
''View of the World'' has been imitated without authorization in a variety of ways.<ref name=LaM/> The work has been imitated in postcard format by numerous municipalities, states and nations.<ref name=SS/> Fulford, writing in The ''[[National Post]]'', noted that the metaphor of the world as a suburb of Manhattan was "understood and borrowed" by the whole world. Local artists, especially poster artists, presented similarly compelling depictions of their own provincial perceptions. Fulford demonstrated the prominence of this work by mentioning that a high school in suburban [[Ottawa]] made imitating ''View of the World'' an assignment in its [[graphic arts]] class. He also noted that the results of this assignment was a worldwide variety of global foci from which the students viewed the world.<ref name=Apot>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertfulford.com/2005-06-21-steinberg.html|title=A 'parody of talent': A new book posits that Saul Steinberg did for art what James Joyce did for literature |accessdate=2012-10-05|date=2005-6-21|publisher=RobertFulford.com|author=Fulford, Robert}}</ref>

The illustration<U+2014>humorously depicting New Yorkers' self-image of their place in the world, or perhaps outsiders' view of New Yorkers' self-image<U+2014>inspired many similar works, including the poster for the [[1984 in film|1984 film]] ''[[Moscow on the Hudson]]''; that movie poster led to a lawsuit, ''[[Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.]]'', 663 F. Supp. 706 ([[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|S.D.N.Y.]] 1987), which held that [[Columbia Pictures]] violated the [[copyright]] Steinberg held on his work.

On June 5, 2003, during the first term of [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Presidency of George W. Bush|presidency]], [[Ted Rall]] presented ''A View of the World from Pennsylvania Avenue'' as a Parody of ''View of the World from 9th Avenue'' in a [[Universal Press Syndicate]] [[editorial cartoon]]. He replaced the letters representing ''The New Yorker'' with ''The Bushie''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilpost.it/2012/04/05/steinberg-new-yorker/a-view-of-the-world-from-pennsylvania-avenue/|title=A View of the World from Pennsylvania Avenue|publisher=[[Universal Press Syndicate]]/[[:it:Il Post|Il Post]]|author=Rall, Ted|accessdate=2012-10-05|date=2003-06-03}}</ref>

The cover was later satirized by Barry Blitt for the cover of ''The New Yorker'' on October 6, 2008. The cover featured [[Sarah Palin]] looking out of her window seeing only Alaska, with Russia in the far background.<ref>{{cite web|author=New Yorker Cover <U+2013> 10/6/2008|url=http://www.condenaststore.com/-sp/The-New-Yorker-Cover-October-6-2008-Prints_i8482999_.htm|title=New Yorker Cover <U+2013> 10/6/2008 at The New Yorker Store|publisher=Newyorkerstore.com|date=October 6, 2008|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}</ref>

The March 21, 2009 ''[[The Economist]]'' included a story entitled "How China sees the World"  that presents a parody that is also an homage to the original image, but depicting the viewpoint from Beijing's [[Chang'an Avenue]] instead of Manhattan. A caption above the illustration reads "Illustration by [[Jon Berkeley]] (with apologies to steinberg and ''The New Yorker'')". It accompanied an article that discussed the burgeoning Chinese economy at the time of the [[2007<U+2013>2012 global financial crisis|the contemporary financial crisis]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/13326106|title=How China sees the world: And how the world should see China |publisher=Economist.com|date=2009-03-21|accessdate=2012-10-08}}</ref>

The October 1, 2012 cover of ''[[Mad Magazine]]'' satirized the problems with the September release of [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iOS 6]] [[mobile operating system]] which included [[Maps (application)|Apple Maps]], a replacement for [[Google Maps]].<ref name=VotWf9AasoAM>{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2012/10/02/mad-magazine-apple-maps-parody/|title=View of the World from 9th Avenue... as seen on Apple Maps|accessdate=2012-10-04|date=2012-10-02|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Busis, Hillary}}</ref><ref name=AMWHwNYC>{{cite web|url=http://www.madmagazine.com/blog/2012/10/01/apple-maps-wreak-havoc-with-new-yorker-cover|title=Apple Maps Wreak Havoc with New Yorker Cover|accessdate=2012-10-04|date=2012-10-01|work=[[Mad Magazine]]}}</ref> The work presents what ''View of the World'' might look like if one had relied upon the September 2012 version of Apple Maps to locate various landmarks.<ref name=VotWf9AasoAM/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57524671-1/the-new-yorkers-view-from-9th-avenue-via-apple-maps/|title=The New Yorker's view from 9th Avenue -- via Apple Maps|accessdate=2012-10-05|date=2012-10-02|publisher=[[CNET]]|author=Mack, Eric}}</ref>

==Critical review==
On October 17, 2005, [[American Society of Magazine Editors]] unveiled its list of the top 40 magazine covers of the prior 40 years and ranked ''View of the World from 9th Avenue'' 4th. The listing stated that the work "...has come to represent Manhattan's telescoped perception of the country beyond the Hudson River. The cartoon showed the supposed limited mental geography of Manhattanites."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magazine.org/asme/magazine-cover-contests/asmes-top-40-magazine-covers-last-40-years|title=ASME's Top 40 Magazine Covers of the Last 40 Years|accessdate=2012-10-04|date=2005-10-17|publisher=[[American Society of Magazine Editors]]|author=}}</ref>
