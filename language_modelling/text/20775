'''The Virgin Tour''' is the debut [[concert tour]] by American recording artist [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. The tour supported her first two [[studio album]]s, ''[[Madonna (album)|Madonna]]'' (1983) and ''[[Like a Virgin]]'' (1984). Although, initially planned for an international audience, the tour was restricted within United States and Canada only. Warner Bros. decided to send Madonna on the tour, after ''Like a Virgin'' became a success. After its official announcement on March 15, 1985, Madonna and her team started working on it. Madonna wanted the tour to be a reflection of her own self and collaborated with designer [[Maripol]] for the costumes. [[Beastie Boys]] were signed as the opening act, while [[record producer]] [[Patrick Leonard]] was signed as the music director for the tour.

The stage was circular in shape and consisted of ramps around it, with lighting arrangements hanging about 30 feet above the stage. Four giant screens lined the outer perimeter of the stage, on three sides. The set list consisted of songs from ''Madonna'' and ''Like a Virgin''; the songs were performed by Madonna, who was backed by two dancers, as she moved energetically across the stage. The show ended with Madonna in a wedding dress, performing "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]" and "[[Material Girl]]".

The Virgin Tour received mixed reception from critics, but was a commercial success. As soon as the tour was announced, tickets were sold everywhere. [[Macy's]] New York department store was flooded with buyers, who bought the tour merchandise like the crucifix earrings and fingerless gloves. After its end, the Virgin Tour was reported to have grossed over $5&nbsp;million, with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Boxscore reporting a gross of $3.3&nbsp;million. The tour was recorded and released in VHS<U+2014>as ''[[Live <U+2013> The Virgin Tour]]''<U+2014>and received a [[RIAA certifications|gold]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). With the commencement of the Virgin Tour, people<U+2014>especially women<U+2014>thronged to see it wearing clothes inspired by Madonna. This frenzy regarding Madonna gave rise to a new term called [[Madonna wannabe]]<U+2014>a word that was ultimately officially recognized by the [[Webster's Dictionary]] in May 1991.

The Virgin Tour was officially announced on March 15, 1985, by Warner Bros. Records.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sippel|first=John|title=Madonna's First Major U.S. Tour To Begin April 10|journal=[[Billboard (magazine){{!}}Billboard]]|date=1985-04-06|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, inc|volume=97|issn=0006-2510|issue= 14|pages=42|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=MCQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT97&dq=madonna+virgin+tour&hl=en&ei=AMMtTJaIA8G78gbU2vD2Ag&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=madonna%20virgin%20tour&f=false|accessdate=2010-07-02}}</ref> Prior to the tour, Madonna's only live performances were limited to evening shows at nightclubs like [[Danceteria]], [[CBGB]] and [[Mudd Club]], and only the [[1984 MTV Video Music Awards]], where she performed her song "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]".<ref name="tara1"/> Following the success of the ''[[Like a Virgin]]'' album, the record label wanted to milk-in the success of the album by sending Madonna on a worldwide tour. However, the tour was restricted within United States and Canada. It did not visit Europe, Asia or other continents.<ref name="tara1">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=21}}</ref> Early on there were plans to schedule dates in England and Japan due to Madonna's large fan base in both countries, however the final schedule did not reflect the idea. In the end several more U.S. dates were added and the tour was moved to larger concert venues due to overwhelmingly strong ticket sales.<ref name="morton"/> Madonna was quite nervous to perform in front of a huge audience, and singing with a live band for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Liz|title=Madonna A Hit|url=http://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=nPUPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Z48DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2039,1532526&dq=madonna+virgin+tour&hl=en|accessdate=2010-07-01|newspaper=[[Daily Record (Washington)|Daily Record]]|date=1985-04-11}}</ref> During a 2009 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', interviewer Austin Scaggs asked Madonna regarding her feelings and emotions during the tour, since it was the first time she was playing in arenas. Madonna replied saying,
<blockquote>
"That whole tour was crazy, because I went from playing CBGB and the Mudd Club to playing sporting arenas. I played a small theater in Seattle, and the girls had flap skirts on and the tights cut off below their knees and lace gloves and rosaries and bows in their hair and big hoop earrings. I was like, 'This is insane!' After Seattle, all of the shows were moved to arenas. I've never done a bus tour. Everyone says they are really fun."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scaggs|first=Austin|date=2009-10-29|title=Madonna Looks Back: The Rolling Stone Interview|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|location=San Francisco|issue=1090|pages=51|issn=0035-791X}}</ref>
</blockquote>

==Development==
After the tour was confirmed, Madonna and her troupe started working on it. Madonna wanted it to be "loud and brazen, and a reflection of my street-style and DGAF attitude."<ref name="tara1"/> She wanted a concert where people can enjoy themselves as much as she would enjoy performing. Commenting on the development, Madonna said "I normally hate performances where there is just a singer singing, and a lame-ass band playing in the background; or shows where there is a rocker screaming his lungs out and jumping on the crowd. That just plain sucks! That's why I wanted something different, something that would be memorable."<ref name="tara1"/> For the show, Madonna collaborated with her designer friend [[Maripol]] for the clothes and the fashion. Maripol operated a small fabric boutique called Maripolitan in [[Greenwich Village]], where the designs and the clothes for the tour were decided by her and Madonna.<Ref name="voller2"/> Rehearsals for the show started in late February, with auditions and choosing the dancers going on in-between. Madonna specifically wanted male back-up dancers, citing that the "provocating moves that I do on stage works better with men beside me."<ref name="morton"/> To further promote the tour, Warner Bros. Entertainers Merchandise Management Corp. introduced  the Boy Toy collection, named after the belt buckle Madonna wore on the ''Like a Virgin'' album cover picture. It consisted of a rectangular buckle, with the words "Boy" and "Toy" emblazed on it in gold color.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rourke|first=Mary|title=A Mad, Mad World of `Madonnas'|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/64456024.html?dids=64456024:64456024&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+31%2C+1985&author=MARY+ROURKE&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=A+Mad%2C+Mad+World+of+%60Madonnas'&pqatl=google|accessdate=2010-07-02|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1985-05-31}}</ref> For choosing a music director for the tour, Madonna's manager [[Freddy DeMann]] contacted [[record producer]] [[Patrick Leonard]], who had just returned from the [[Victory Tour (The Jacksons tour)|Victory Tour]] by [[The Jacksons]].<ref name="fred"/> At first Leonard said no, feeling exhausted from the Victory Tour, but after he spoke to Madonna on the phone, he found her charming, and agreed to sign for the tour.<ref name="fred">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=637}}</ref>

[[Beastie Boys]], who worked as the opening band for singer [[John Lydon]]'s band, was signed as the opening act for the tour. [[MCA (musician)|Adam "MCA" Yauch]] of the group recollected: "One day, Russell Simmons, co-founder of [[Def Jam Recordings]], came in and said, 'Hey guess what<U+2014>Madonna's manager called. Do you guys want to go on tour with her?"<ref name="beast"/> DeMann had asked for another group called [[The Fat Boys]], but Simmons did not manage them and lied, saying "Oh, the Fat Boys have another gig that week. What about [[Run<U+2013>D.M.C.]]?" But they were too expensive according to DeMann, and hence ultimately Beastie Boys were chosen.<ref name="beast"/> [[Horovitz|Adam "Ad-Rock" Horovitz]] from the band commented: "It's not like any of us knew Madonna that much, but we all used to hang out at [[Dancetaria]] [club] so we knew about each other. I don't know why she thought it would be a good idea [to open for her tour], though. It was a terrible idea. But it was great for her in a way because we were so awful that by the time she came onstage, the audience had to be happy."<ref name="beast">{{cite journal|last=Light|first=Alan|title=The Story of Yo|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=1998-09-09|volume=14|issue=9|pages=152|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=-5EbyHNqgkwC&pg=PA152&dq=madonna+virgin+tour&hl=en&ei=9J0tTLjjLMOB8gab0-2rAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFoQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=madonna%20virgin%20tour&f=false|accessdate=2010-07-02|issn=0886-3032|authorlink=Alan Light}}</ref> The circular stage for the tour, consisted of three ramps around the perimeter, which were connected with each other.

==Concert synopsis==
The show opened with [[The Beastie Boys]] performing six of their songs for 30 minutes.<Ref name="pitt"/> They were accompanied by a DJ who [[scratching|scratched]] the music, with The Beastie Boys prancing around the stage, making lewd gestures towards the audience.<Ref name="pitt"/> As they finished their performance, the backdrops started displaying Madonna's images from her music videos.<Ref name="pitt"/> The band<U+2014>consisting of guitarists, bassists, a drummer and three synthesizer players<U+2014>came into focus, and the music started.<ref name="pitt"/> Madonna's voice was heard, declaring: "When I was young, I had a dream. I wanted to be a big star. I went to New York. I didn't know anybody. I wanted to dance. I wanted to sing&nbsp;... I worked really hard. And my dream came true.<ref>{{harvnb|Dunn|Jones|1996|p=243}}</ref> As the speech got over, Madonna appeared on top of the stairs, wearing a blue see-through crop-top, revealing her characteristic black bra. She also had lacy leggings and crucifixes around her ear and her neck. She posed on the stairs before reaching the microphone to sing "[[Dress You Up]]".<ref name="clerk">{{harvnb|Clerk|2002|p=41}}</ref> After dancing to the last note of the music, Madonna and the two male back-up dancers went to the back of the stage, as the music of "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]" began.<ref name="clerk"/> Taking a moment to ask the audience how they are feeling, Madonna declared, "I was never elected homecoming queen, but I sure feel like one now," and started the performance of "[[Into the Groove]]", playing a [[tambourine]].<Ref name="nytimes"/> A [[boom box]] was present on the stage during the performance, Madonna sitting and playing with it, and addressing it as her "box".<ref name="metz">{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=5}}</ref> She continued with "[[Everybody (Madonna song)|Everybody]]", while asking the audience to clap along with her.<Ref name="metz"/> As she finished the vigorous performance of "Everybody", the lights were dimmed and the introduction music of "[[Angel (Madonna song)|Angel]]" started. [[Lighting control console#Moving light controllers|Rotating lights]] fell on the stage. Madonna appeared sitting on top of the stairs and gradually descended. During the intermediate bridge, she and her dancers moved energetically around the whole stage, as white balloons fell on them from above.<ref name="clerk"/> Madonna continued singing as the lights were dimmed again. She finished the performance and disappeared behind the [[Stage (theatre)#Proscenium stage|wings]] for a costume change.<ref name="clerk"/>

She appeared on the stage wearing a black, fringed micro-top and similar skirt, with her belly-button exposed, and a number of crucifixes in different sizes, hanging from different parts of her body.<ref name="clerk2">{{harvnb|Clerk|2002|p=49}}</ref> As the guitar intro of "[[Gambler (Madonna song)|Gambler]]" started, Madonna stood on the side-stage and started dancing energetically, as flashlights fell on her. While singing the song, she sometimes opened her jacket and sometimes straddled a steel structure present on the side of the stage. The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main one.<ref name="clerk2"/> She then performed two slow tempo songs<U+2014>"[[Borderline (song)|Borderline]]" and "[[Crazy for You (song)|Crazy for You]]"<U+2014>while touching the hands of the audience members.<Ref name="morton"/> Madonna then returned to the microphone and started singing "Over and Over" from ''Like a Virgin''. It was followed by "[[Burning Up]]" during which she caressed one of the guitarist, ultimately disappearing for another constume change.<Ref name="voller1"/> As the music of the song "Like a Virgin" started, Madonna returned on the stage, wearing a wedding dress, holding a bouquet in her hand and a long white veil behind her. Accessorized by a white bow atop her head and lacy, three-quarter length gloves, she also had a crucifix on her waistband and another hanging from a long chain around her neck.<ref name="clerk"/> Madonna asked the audience "Do you want to marry me?" When the audience answered affirmatively, she threw the bouquet towards them and started singing the song.<ref name="kell">{{harvnb|Kellner|1995|p=272}}</ref> Madonna continued singing the song while rollling around the floor, and added a snippet of [[Michael Jackson]]'s [[Motown]]-style single, "[[Billie Jean]]". Balloons floated out towards the audience again as she pulled apart her veil and threw it towards the audience.<ref name="kell"/> She returned to the stage in the arms of one of the backup dancers, wearing a [[tube top|boob tube]] and a tight white skirt, carrying a bunch of notes in her left hand, and a number of garlands around her neck.<Ref name="clerk"/> In a self-parodying performance of the song "[[Material Girl]]", at the end of the performance Madonna asked the audience "Do you really think I'm a material girl?&nbsp;... I'm not&nbsp;... Take it [Throwing fake money]&nbsp;... I don't need money&nbsp;... I need love."<ref name="metz"/> As she began to strip off more clothes and jewelry, she was apprehended and marched offstage by an extra posing as her father. In Detroit, her father Tony Ciccone himself did the honors. The show ended with Madonna returning onstage once more to take her fur coat and doing a [[curtsey]].<ref name="clerk"/>

==Critical reception==
[[File:Madonna-like a virgin-bride.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A Barbie doll in a wedding dress, like the one Madonna wore on the tour at the time.]]
The tour received generally mixed reviews from critics. Jason Stratley from ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' said that "On stage, wiggling and writhing, a rock-video vision of messy, bleached- blond hair, bare skin, sequined paisley and dime store diamonds was the flash-and-trash rock queen Madonna. Behold the Madonna clones<U+2014>she is turning into one fine legend."<ref>{{cite news|last=Stratley|first=Jason|title=Madonna: Virgin Tour: Review|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB299716DE99183&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=2010-01-07|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=1985-05-03}}</ref> Jeff Sewald from the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' felt that "the modus operandi [of the tour] was clear. Madonna was not only selling her music to throngs of teen-agers and adults alike, but she was selling herself and the entire package proved to be a joy for the 14,500 screaming fans.

Like the early Monroe, Madonna may portray a bimbo, but there she's clearly no pushover. Though the audience was on its feet throughout, it often seemed that Madonna was operating beneath her potential in this pop format. It's important to demonstrate that she can handle herself live, but the simplicity of pop concerts doesn't begin to tax her ambition or talent. In fact, she has so little to do other than express this aggressive, sexy attitude that the show seemed long at just over an hour.<ref name="latimes">{{cite news|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|title=Pop Review: Madonna Makes A Hot Topic|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/64431631.html?dids=64431631:64431631&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+22%2C+1985&author=ROBERT+HILBURN&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=POP+REVIEW+MADONNA+MAKES+A+HOT+TOPIC&pqatl=google|accessdate=2010-07-01|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1985-04-22}}</ref> Heidi Sherman from ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' commented, "The Virgin Tour was Madonna's first, yet it put her in the same league as Prince and [[Bruce Springsteen]].

{{Main|Live <U+2013> The Virgin Tour}}

The 1985 ''Live <U+2013> The Virgin Tour'' [[VHS]] documents a [[Detroit, Michigan]] stop on the tour. "Angel", "Borderline" and "Burning Up" were part of the tour set list but were not included on the official VHS release. It was certified [[RIAA certifications|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for shipment of 50,000 copies and received a "Video Software Dealers Award" for the Most Popular Music Video in September 1986.<ref>{{cite journal|title=VSDA: Viva Las Vegas|date=1986-09-20|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|volume=98|issue=38|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> The video received mixed reviews from critics.

==Legacy==

When the tour first started, people<U+2014>especially women<U+2014>thronged to see it wearing clothes inspired by Madonna.<Ref name="voller1">{{harvnb|Voller|1999|p=21}}</ref> Debbi Voller, author of ''Madonna: The Style Book'', observed that "Hundreds of thousands of young girls came to the concert dressed like her, with bleached and tousled hair, see-through tops, bras, fingerless gloves and crucifixes. Magazines and TV shows ran lookalike competitions."<ref name="voller1"/> This frenzy regarding Madonna gave rise to a new term called [[Madonna wannabe]]<U+2014>a word that was ultimately officially recognized by the [[Webster's Dictionary]] in May 1991.<ref name="voller1"/> Madonna was mystified as to why all the women would want to copy her look. She commented,
<blockquote>
"I never set out to be a role model. I am a strong woman, a successful woman, and I don't conform to a stereotype. For so long women have been told that there are certain ways they mustn't look if they want to get ahead in life. And there I was dressing in a forbidden way and yet obviously in charge of my life. It was then I realized why were all of them out there in their seats, dressing like me."<ref name="voller1"/>
</blockquote>
While the tour was going on, the American lingerie industry reported that their turnover was suddenly up by 40 percent and that Madonna's image was responsible for this underwear revival.<ref name="voller2">{{harvnb|Voller|1999|p=22}}</ref> Sam Gower from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' commented, "In the sixties, women burned their bras, now they wear five at a time, and bare their belly buttons. Madonna has done for the corset and crucifix what punk did for the safety pin. [[Macy's]] New York department store was flooded with buyers, who bought the tour merchandise like the crucifix earrings and fingerless gloves."<ref name="voller2"/> The demand was so huge that Macy's had to refill the merchandise time again.<Ref name="voller2"/> Madonna's subversive antics on the tour provoked fiery and antics among the press. ''Rolling Stone'' said: "Like [[Marilyn Monroe]], Madonna is bent on epitomizing and championing a vision of female sexuality, and like Monroe she is often dismissed as an artist for doing so."<ref name="voller2"/> Suzanne Ferriss, author of ''On Fashion'' said that "Virgin Tour exemplified Madonna<U+2019>s extended desire to treat boys as toys and her chastity belt coming off at her own whim and desire. Her dance numbers with men during the tour shows them as her under linings, accessories that she toys with and totally dominates."<ref>{{harvnb|Benstock|Ferriss|1994|p=169}}</ref>
