'''Freia''' is an American owned [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[chocolate]] brand. The company was founded in 1889, but real success was seen only in 1892, when [[Johan Throne Holst]] (1868-1946) took over management. Holst realized that there was a potential market for edible milk chocolate, in addition to the dark chocolate and other minor products Freia were producing at the time. By the turn of the century, Freia was the leading Norwegian brand in [[sweets]].

Based on the success in Norway, the Throne-Holst family in 1916 founded the [[chocolate factory]] [[Marabou (chocolate)|Marabou]] in [[Upplands V<U+00E4>sby]] outside of [[Stockholm]] in [[Sweden]]. The name Freia (or Freja) could not be used due to a conflicting [[trademark]] in Sweden, and the name of the species of bird on the Freia logo (a [[Marabou Stork]]) was chosen instead.

On the basis of their famous [[Freia Melkesjokolade|Melkesjokolade]] Freia produces several other [[candy bars]], with added [[Nut (fruit)|nut]]s, [[raisin]]s, [[cookie]]s and [[Daim]] pieces.

Their slogan is "Et lite stykke Norge", this translates to "A small piece of Norway".

The company<U+2019>s flagship product has since then been [[Freia Melkesjokolade]] (Freia Milk Chocolate), and the brand has constantly been marketed in a [[national romantic]] spirit - as the essence of everything that is Norwegian. This image is somewhat deceptive, however, as Freia was purchased in 1993 by USA's [[Kraft Foods]], for [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] 3 billion.

Today the company is still famous for the [[Freia Melkesjokolade]], the [[Freia Kokesjokolade]] and the [[Kvikk Lunsj]], but also for [[candy]] and other [[food]] and [[dessert]] products.
