'''John Ono Lennon''', [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born '''John Winston Lennon'''; [[9 October]] [[1940]] &ndash; [[8 December]] [[1980]]) was an [[England|English]] [[Rock music|rock]] [[musician]], singer and songwriter, who gained worldwide fame as one of the founders and members of [[The Beatles]]. 

In his solo career, Lennon wrote and recorded songs such as "[[Give Peace a Chance]]" and "[[Imagine (song)|Imagine]]". Lennon revealed his rebellious nature and wit on [[television]], in [[film]]s such as ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', in [[book]]s such as ''[[In His Own Write]]'', and in press conferences and interviews. He was controversial through his work as a [[activism|peace activist]], [[drawing|artist]], and [[writer|author]]. 

Lennon had two sons: [[Julian Lennon]], with his first wife [[Cynthia Lennon]], and [[Sean Ono Lennon]], with his second wife, [[avant-garde]] artist [[Yoko Ono]]. After a self-imposed retirement from 1976-1980, Lennon reemerged with a comeback album, and was murdered one month later in New York City on [[8 December]] [[1980]]. In 2002, respondents to a [[BBC]] poll on the [[100 Greatest Britons]] voted Lennon into eighth place. In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked Lennon number 38 on its list of "The Immortals: The Fifty Greatest Artists of All Time" and ranked The Beatles at number 1.

Throughout the rest of his childhood and adolescence, Lennon lived with his Aunt Mimi and her husband [[George Smith (John Lennon)|George Smith]], who had no children of their own, in a [[middle class]] area of Liverpool in a house called "Mendips" ([[251 Menlove Avenue]]).

Lennon left The Beatles in September 1969 (Starr had previously left and then returned during 1968, and Harrison had left on [[10 January]] [[1969]], during the filming for ''[[Let It Be (album)|Let It Be]]'', but returned after a Beatles' meeting at Starr's house two days later).<ref name="Spitzp809"> Spitz - ''The Beatles: The Biography'' p809</ref> Lennon agreed not to make an announcement while the band renegotiated their recording contract, but McCartney released a question-and-answer interview that he had written himself in April 1970, declaring that he was no longer a member of The Beatles.<ref name="Spitzp853"> Spitz - ''The Beatles: The Biography'' p853</ref> Lennon's reaction when told was, "Jesus Christ!

In 1970, [[Jann Wenner]] recorded an interview with Lennon that was played on [[BBC]] radio in 2005. The interview reveals Lennon's bitterness towards McCartney and the hostility he felt that the other members had for Ono. Lennon said: "One of the main reasons The Beatles ended is because we got fed up with being sidemen for Paul. After [[Brian Epstein]] died we collapsed. Paul took over and supposedly led us.

While still a Beatle, Lennon and Ono recorded three albums of experimental music, ''[[Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins]]'', ''[[Unfinished Music No.2: Life with the Lions]]'', and ''[[Wedding Album]]''. His first "solo" album was ''[[Live Peace in Toronto 1969]]''<U+2014>recorded prior to the breakup of The Beatles<U+2014>recorded at a Rock 'n' Roll Festival in [[Toronto]] with [[The Plastic Ono Band]]. He also recorded three solo singles: the anti-war anthem, "Give Peace a Chance", "[[Cold Turkey]]", and "[[Instant Karma!]]". Following The Beatles' split in 1970, Lennon released the ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]'' album.

==Marriages and relationships==
<!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages.  -->
In one of his last major interviews, in September 1980, Lennon said that he had never questioned his [[chauvinistic]] attitudes towards women until he met Ono. Lennon was always distant with his first son, but was close to his second son, calling him, "My pride". Near the end of Lennon's life, he said that he accepted the role of [[househusband]], after taking on the role of a [[wife]] and mother in his relationship with Ono.<ref name=" LennonPlayboyInterview1980"/>

Cynthia Powell met Lennon at the [[Liverpool Art College]] in 1957.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp22"/>  Although Lennon was not her type, she was attracted to him.

Lennon was on tour and would not see Julian for three days, and shortly after went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, which would lead to speculation of an affair between the two. At McCartney's twenty-first birthday party, a drunken Lennon attacked Cavern Club MC [[Bob Wooler]] for saying "How was your [[honeymoon]], John?" (Wooler was referring to Lennon's marriage, and not Lennon's holiday in Spain with Epstein).<ref>Cynthia Lennon, John, pg 155</ref> In 1991, a fictionalized account of the Lennon/Epstein holiday was made into an independent movie called ''The Hours And Times''.<ref name="HoursandTimes">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104448/ |title=The Hours and Times |publisher=IMDb |date=[[1991]]|accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> Lennon was distant to Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. Julian later said, "I've never really wanted to know the truth about how dad was with me. There was some very negative stuff talked about me ... like when he said I'd come out of a whiskey bottle on a Saturday night.<ref name="LennonPlayboyInterview1980"/> Stuff like that.

Cynthia Lennon had become aware of Lennon's infidelities, but cites his increasing drug use for their growing apart. She was also aware of Lennon's friendship with Ono. Eventually, she actually suggested to Lennon that perhaps Ono was the woman for him.<ref>Cynthia Lennon: A Twist of Lennon, Avon 1978 p182</ref> When Lennon and The Beatles went to [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] to meditate, Cynthia and Lennon were separated on the train platform. A policeman, who did not recognize her, kept her from boarding the train. As she watched Lennon pull out of the station, she broke into tears. In the documentary ''Imagine'' she explained, "Normally I wouldn't have broken down, I'd have kept my cool... I knew I'd get there anyway.  But at that point I felt so sad.  This was symbolic of our life... I'm getting off at this station."<ref>Cynthia Lennon Interview, ''Imagine'', Documentary, Warner Brothers 1988</ref> Lennon later tried to sue Cynthia for divorce, claiming she had committed adultery and not him.<ref name="Colemanp464"> Coleman - ''Lennon: The Definitive Biography'' p464</ref> When it was discovered that Ono had become pregnant, Cynthia petitioned Lennon for divorce. During negotiations Lennon refused to give his wife any more than <U+00A3>75,000, saying, "What have you done to deserve it? Christ, it's like winning the bloody [[Football pools|pools]]." The case was settled out of court, with Cynthia receiving <U+00A3>100,000, <U+00A3>2,400 annually, custody of Julian and the Lennons' house (Kenwood).<ref name="Colemanp467"> Coleman - ''Lennon: The Definitive Biography'' p467</ref>

In an interview shortly before his death, Lennon said he was trying to re-establish a connection with the then 17-year-old Julian, and confidently predicted that "Julian and I will have a relationship in the future."

On [[31 January]] [[1975]], the Lennons reunited and, on [[9 October]] [[1975]] <U+2013> Lennon's 35th birthday <U+2013> Ono gave birth to a son, Sean Ono Lennon. Lennon issued a statement: "I feel higher than the [[Empire State Building]]" and soon retired from the music business.<ref name="HowstuffWorksAlfredLennon"/> He cited many reasons, but they were primarily the fact that he had been under contract since he was 22 years old and he was now free, rock 'n' roll was not as interesting as it once was, and the limited relationship he had had with first son made him decide to live a family life and become a househusband.<ref name="LennonPlayboyInterview1980"/>

Lennon and Ono used their honeymoon at the [[Amsterdam]] [[Hilton Hotel|Hilton]], in March 1969, as a "Bed-in for Peace" that attracted world-wide [[mass media|media]] coverage.<ref name="EternalFlame">{{cite web|first=Precious|last= Williams |url=http://news.scotsman.com/ViewArticle.aspx?articleid=2328156 |title= Eternal Flame |publisher=scotsman.com |date=[[2002-05-19]]|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> At the second "Bed-in" in Montreal, in June 1969, they recorded "Give Peace a Chance" in their hotel room.

In 1972, the [[Richard Nixon]] Administration wanted to silence Lennon by trying to have him [[deportation|deported]] from the U.S., as [[Richard Nixon]] believed that Lennon's support for [[George McGovern]] could lose him the next election.<ref name="JudgeReleasesLennonLetters">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/648607.stm|title= Judge releases Lennon letters |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2007-12-16}}</ref> Republican Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] suggested, in a February 1972 memo, that "deportation would be a strategic counter-measure" against Lennon.<ref name="ThurmondLennon">{{cite web |url= http://www.thenation.com/blogs/notion?pid=120879 |title= The US vs. John Lennon |publisher=thenation.com|accessdate=2007-12-17}}</ref> The next month the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] began deportation proceedings against Lennon, arguing that his 1968 [[misdemeanour]] conviction for cannabis possession in London had made him ineligible for admission to the U.S. Lennon spent the next four years in deportation hearings.<ref name="LennonFilmMakersCreditCampaign"/> [[Image:Lennon72.jpg|thumb|right|Lennon at an anti-war protest in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]] in 1972.]] While his deportation battle continued, Lennon appeared at rallies in New York City and on TV shows, including a week hosting the ''Mike Douglas Show'' in February 1972, where Jerry Rubin and Bobby Seale appeared as his guests.<ref name="LennonRubinMikeDouglas">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4786289.stm|title= Lennon and Rubin on the Mike Douglas show |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2007-12-16}}</ref>.

On [[23 March]] [[1973]], Lennon was ordered to leave the U.S. within 60 days, while Ono was granted permanent residence.<ref name="ImportantDates">{{cite web |url=http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/years/1973.htm |title=Nostalgia Central - important dates 1973 |publisher=nostalgiacentral.com|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> In response, Lennon and Ono held a press conference at the New York American Bar Association on [[1 April]] [[1973]] to announce the formation of the conceptual state of "[[Nutopia]]"; a place with "no land, no boundaries, no passports, only people", and all of its inhabitants would be ambassadors.<ref name="joinnutopia">{{cite web |url=http://www.joinnutopia.com/ |title=Declaration of Nutopia |publisher=joinnutopia.com|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> The Lennons asked for political asylum in the U.S. while waving the white flag of Nutopia; two white [[handkerchief]]s.

Lennon's order of deportation was overturned in 1975. After Lennon<U+2019>s murder, historian [[Jon Wiener]] filed a [[Freedom of Information]] request for FBI files on Lennon.<ref name="WienerJon1999"> Wiener <U+201C>Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI Files<U+201C> 1999</ref> The FBI admitted it had 281 pages in its files on Lennon but refused to release most of them, claiming they were national security documents. In 1983, Wiener sued the FBI with the help of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of Southern California. The case went to the Supreme Court before the FBI settled out of court in 1997; releasing all but ten of the contested documents.<ref name="LennonFBIfiles">{{cite web |url=http://www.LennonFBIfiles.com |title=Lennon's FBI files |publisher=LennonFBIfiles.com|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> The story is told in the documentary ''The U.S. vs. John Lennon'', by David Leaf and John Scheinfeld, released in theatres in September 2006, and on DVD in February 2007.

In 1976, Lennon's U.S. immigration status was finally resolved favourably, and he received his [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]]. With the departure of Nixon from the White House, his successor, [[Gerald Ford]], showed little interest in continuing the battle. When [[Jimmy Carter]] was inaugurated as president on [[19 January]] [[1977]], Lennon and Ono attended the Inaugural Ball.<ref name="LennonandCartersBall">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.activemusician.com/John-Lennon-Biography--t8i1613 |title=John Lennon Biography |publisher=Active Musician |accessdate=2008-03-02}}</ref><ref name="InauguralBalls">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://209.85.129.104/search?q=cache:SlgLd2psW3sJ:www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/politics/inauguration/history.pdf+%22Jimmy+Carter%22+%2B+%22Inaugural+Ball%22+%2B+Lennon&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=5&gl=uk |title=Inaugural History (page 20) |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=2008-03-02}}</ref>

In 1970, Lennon and Ono went through [[Primal therapy]] with Dr. [[Arthur Janov]] in Los Angeles, California. The therapy consisted of releasing emotional pain by screaming, but Lennon and Ono ended the sessions before completing a full course of therapy, as Ono constantly argued with Janov.<ref name="LennonPlayboyInterview1980"/><ref name="JanovTherapy">{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/carousel/pob11.html  |title=John Lennon and Primal therapy |publisher=ntlworld.com|accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref>

===Humour===
<!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages. -->
Each of The Beatles was known, especially during [[Beatlemania]], for their sense of humour. During live performances of "[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]", Lennon often changed the words to "I want to hold your [[mammary gland|gland]]", because of the difficulty hearing the vocals above the noise of screaming audiences. At the Royal Variety Show in 1963<U+2014>in the presence of members of the British royalty<U+2014>Lennon told the audience, "Those of you in the cheaper seats can clap your hands. The rest of you, if you'll just rattle your jewellery."<ref name="LiverpoolLifestyle">{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-life/liverpool-lifestyle/2007/11/26/what-will-liz-think-of-these-100252-20163545/ |title=What will Liz think of these? |publisher=liverpoolecho.co.uk|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> Lennon put on weight during 1965, and later said, "It was my fat-Elvis period."<ref>Lawrence ''John Lennon: In His Own Words'' 2005 p62</ref> 

During the "[[Get Back]]" sessions, Lennon introduced "[[Dig a Pony]]" by shouting, "I dig a [[pygmy]] by [[Charles Hawtrey (talkies)|Charles Hawtrey]] and the [[Hearing aid|Deaf Aids]]; phase one in which Doris gets her [[sex|oats]]!" The phrase was later edited to precede "[[Two of Us]]" on ''Let It Be''. Lennon often counter-pointed McCartney's upbeat lyrics, as in "[[Getting Better]]":

: McCartney: "I've got to admit it's getting better, a little better, all the time."

: Lennon: "Can't get no worse."<ref name="scoresp310"> Leonard <U+201C>The Beatles - Complete Scores<U+201D> 1993 p310</ref>

Lennon appeared in various television comedy shows, such as the ''[[Morecambe and Wise]]'' show with the rest of The Beatles, and played a doorman in a gents' toilet in ''[[Not Only But Also]]''.<ref name="MorecambeWise">{{cite web |first=Laurence Marcus |last=Stephen Hulse |url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/morecambeandwise.htm |title=The Morecambe and Wise Show |publisher=Television Heaven |accessdate=2008-03-02}}</ref><ref name="Notonlybutalso">{{cite web |first=Laurence Marcus |last=Stephen R.

==Writing and art==
<!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages. -->
[[Image:06041901.jpg|thumb|right|Lennon's comic, "The Daily Howl".]]
Lennon started writing and drawing early in life, with encouragement from his Uncle George, and created his own [[comic strip]] in his school book, which he called "The Daily Howl". It contained drawings<U+2014>frequently of crippled people<U+2014>and [[satire|satirical]] writings, often with a [[Word play|play on words]].

The first two books by Lennon are examples of [[literary nonsense]]: ''In His Own Write'' (1964) and ''[[A Spaniard in the Works]]'' (1965). Ono later allowed the works of Lennon to be published after his death: ''Skywriting by Word of Mouth'' (1986) and ''Ai: Japan Through John Lennon's Eyes: A Personal Sketchbook'' (1992), which contained Lennon's drawings illustrating the definitions of Japanese words. ''Real Love: The Drawings for Sean'' followed in 1999.

==Pseudonyms==
<!-- Put in-line references into this article from books (with page numbers) or from web pages.  -->
Throughout his solo career, Lennon appeared on his own albums (as well as those of other artists like [[Elton John]]) under such [[pseudonym]]s as Dr Winston O'Boogie, Mel Torment (a play on singer [[Mel Torm<U+00E9>]]), and The Reverend Fred [[Gherkin]]. He and Ono (as Ada Gherkin "ate a gherkin", and other [[sobriquet]]s) also travelled under such names, thus avoiding unwanted public attention.<ref name="SuperSeventies">{{cite web |url=http://www.superseventies.com/lennon4.html superseventies.com |title=Walls And Bridges review and pseudonyms |publisher=superseventies.com|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref>

Lennon also named his session musicians under various different band names during his career, including:<br>
* The Plastic Ono Band (for the ''Plastic Ono Band'' album)
* The Plastic Ono Band with the Flux Fiddlers (''[[Imagine]]'')
* The Plastic U.F.Ono Band (''Mind Games'')
* The Plastic Ono Nuclear Band/Little Big Horns and the Philharmonic Orchestrange (''Walls and Bridges'')

[[Image:ImagineFlowers.jpg|thumb|left|200px| The [[Strawberry Fields Memorial]] in [[Central Park]], New York City.]]

A crowd gathered outside the Dakota the night of Lennon's death. Ono sent word that their singing kept her awake and asked that they re-convene in Central Park the following Sunday for ten minutes of silent prayer.<ref name="TheCentralParkVigil">{{cite web |first=Fiorella Dorotea  |last=Gentile |url=http://www.johnlennon.it/english.htm |title=The Central Park Vigil |publisher=Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna - Rome |accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref>  On [[14 December]] [[1980]], millions of people around the world responded to Ono's request to pause for ten minutes of silence to remember Lennon: Thirty thousand gathered in Liverpool, and the largest group - over 100,000 - converged on New York's Central Park, close to the scene of the shooting.<ref>Clyde Haberman, "Silent Tribute to Lennon's Memory is Observed Throughout the World," ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[15 December]] [[1980]] pA1</ref>

Lennon continues to be mourned throughout the world and has been the subject of numerous [[memorial]]s and tributes, principally New York City's [[Strawberry Fields memorial|Strawberry Fields]], a memorial garden area in [[Central Park]] across the street from the Dakota building.
