'''Vard<U+00F8> Airport, Svartnes''' ({{lang-no|Vard<U+00F8> Lufthavn, Svartnes}}; {{Airport codes|VAW|ENSS|p=n}}) is a [[short take-off and landing]] airport located at [[Svartnes]] in [[Vard<U+00F8>]], [[Norway]]. Owned and operated by the state-owned [[Avinor]], it served 14,664 passengers in 2012. The airport has a {{convert|1145|by|30|m|sp=us|adj=on}} runway aligned 15<U+2013>33. It is served by [[Wider<U+00F8>e]] who operate [[Bombardier Dash 8]] aircraft to [[Kirkenes]] and other communities in [[Finnmark]]. The airport is located {{convert|4|km|sp=us}} from [[Vard<U+00F8>ya]] and the town center.

Svartnes was built by the German [[Luftwaffe]] 1943, where it served [[fighter aircraft]] to protect German convoys. The airport was abandoned in 1944 but reopened by the [[Norwegian Armed Forces]] for military passenger flights. Plans to start civilian operates were launched in the 1960s and from 1970 [[Norving]] started irregular flights to the airport. An upgrade to the terminal and runway were carried out between 1984 and 1990. Wider<U+00F8>e took over flights in 1991.

==History==
Svartnes was constructed by the Luftwaffe during the [[German occupation of Norway]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=h317>Hafsten: 317</ref> The background for the establishment was Soviet attacks on supply convoys operating to Kirkenes.<ref>Hafsten: 171</ref> During construction, on 12 July 1943, eight Soviet [[Ilyushin Il-2]]s attacked Svartnes, but all were shot down. While the war remained in the area Soviet air attacks continued on the air base.<ref>Hafsten: 173</ref> The airport was completed in the fall of 1943, it was exclusively used for fighter aircraft detachments of [[Jagdgeschwader 5]]. These were used as part of the defense of German ship traffic around [[Varangerhalv<U+00F8>ya]]. The original wooden runway was {{convert|1000|by|90|m|sp=us}}.<ref name=h317 /> The [[Wehrmacht]] operated a [[prisoner of war camp]] at the military base.<ref>Olsen: 64</ref> The air base fell into disuse following the German evacuation in 1944.<ref name=gynnild>{{cite web |url=http://avinor.moses.no/index.php?seks_id=135&element=kapittel&k=2 |title=Flyplassenes og flytrafikkens historie |work=Kulturminner p<U+00E5> norske lufthavner <U+2013> Landsverneplan for Avinor |publisher=[[Avinor]] |last=Gynnild |first=Olav |year=2009  |accessdate=25 January 2012 |archivedate=25 January 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DwQ1MXLE |deadurl=no}}</ref>

The wooden runway was pillaged by locals to accumulate building materials for reconstruction.<ref>Dancke: 367</ref> The Norwegian Armed Forces established itself in Vard<U+00F8> in the mid-1950s. The airport was renovated; a terminal was built consisting of two simple barracks, one used as a passenger terminal and the other as a tower, consisting of a glass addition on the roof. The {{convert|1100|by|80|m|sp=us|adj=on}} gravel runway received portable runway lights. The [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] served the airport with [[de Havilland Canada Twin Otter]] and [[Shorts Skyvan]] aircraft to transport military personnel.<ref name=gynnild />

The first plans for a civilian airport at Svartnes was launched by Varangfly, later renamed Norving, in 1964. Vard<U+00F8> was mentioned as one of five villages in Finnmark which the airline hoped to open with simple airfields which could serve [[air taxi]] and [[air ambulance]] flights.<ref>Melling: 52</ref> Two years later several major airlines proposed a network of [[short take-off and landing]] (STOL) airports in Northern Norway, and Vard<U+00F8> was proposed as a possible location.<ref>Melling: 54</ref> A county committee was established in 1966 to look into the matter. It considered seven locations in Finnmark, including Vard<U+00F8> and recommended in its report that planing continue. Simultaneously the Ministry of Transport and Communications was working on a plan for larger [[short take-off and landing]] airports. It decided that such airports will first be built in [[Helgeland]], then [[Lofoten]] and [[Vester<U+00E5>len]] and finally in [[Troms]] and Finnmark.<ref>Melling: 64</ref>

Norving started operating irregular air taxi flights to Vard<U+00F8> after they took delivery of an eight-seat [[Britten-Norman Islander]] in April 1970.<ref>Melling: 66</ref> In addition, the airline used the air field for air ambulance services.<ref name=gynnild /> Norving received permission to operate a scheduled taxi route from Vard<U+00F8> to [[Kirkenes Airport, H<U+00F8>ybuktmoen]] and [[B<U+00E5>tsfjord Airport (1973<U+2013>1999)|B<U+00E5>tsfjord Airport]] from the late 1970s.<ref>Melling: 161</ref>

Construction of a new terminal and upgrading the airport to regional standard started in 1984.<ref name=gynnild /> In February 1987 Vard<U+00F8> Municipality received operating permission from the government. The investments cost NOK&nbsp;11.4 million, of which NOK&nbsp;10 million was to be financed through a loan and the rest through subsidies from the government and the county. The latter was also responsible for covering the operating deficit.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kortbaneflyplass i Vard<U+00F8> |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=25 July 1987 |page=32 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The upgraded airport opened on 6 April 1987. The first two months Norving continued its taxi route service to the airport, but from 1 June a regular concession scheduled service was introduced. Wider<U+00F8>e took over the services in 1991. At first the airport was served using Twin Otters, but from the mid 1990s the Dash 8 was introduced.<ref name=gynnild /> From 1996, Svartnes and 25 other regional airports were taken over by the state and the Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor).<ref>{{cite news |title=Staten eier av flyplasser |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=10 December 1994 |page=25 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Wider<U+00F8>e lost the bid to operate the services between 2000 and 2003 to [[Arctic Air (Norwegian airline)|Arctic Air]], but resumed services in 2003.<ref name=gynnild /> [[Airport security]] was introduced on 1 January 2005.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tre usikre flyplasser i Midt-Norge |last=Solberg |first=P<U+00E5>l E. |work=[[Adresseavisen]] |date=30 September 2004 |page=4 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>
