The '''Centaurus''' was the final development of [[Bristol Engine Company]]'s series of [[sleeve valve]] [[radial engine|radial]] [[aircraft engine]]s, an 18-cylinder two-row design that eventually delivered over 3,000&nbsp;hp (2.2&nbsp;MW).<ref>Gunston 1989, p.33.</ref> It was one of the largest piston aircraft engines to enter production, and started seeing service towards the end of [[World War II]].

The [[Royal Navy Historic Flight]] currently operates a [[Hawker Sea Fury]], powered by a Bristol Centaurus.

==Design and development==
Like most Bristol Engines designs, the Centaurus was based on the mechanicals of an earlier design, in this case the "classic" 5.75&nbsp;in (146&nbsp;mm) piston from their original 1918 [[Bristol Jupiter|Jupiter]]. The Jupiter piston was still in use in the contemporary 14-cylinder [[Bristol Hercules|Hercules]], which was being brought into production during the design of the Centaurus. 
The Centaurus had a cylinder capacity of 3,270 in<U+00B3> (53.6&nbsp;[[Litre|L]]), making it one of the largest piston aircraft engines to enter production, while that of the Hercules was 2,364 cubic inches (38.7&nbsp;L). The nearly 40% higher capacity was achieved by increasing the stroke from {{convert|6.5|to|7|in|mm|abbr=on}}, and by changing to two rows of nine cylinders instead of two rows of seven, but the overall diameter of the Centaurus was only just over 6% greater.<ref name="Jane's">Bridgman (Jane's) 1998, p. 270.</ref> 

While Bristol maintained the Centaurus dated from 1938 (the year it was originally type-tested),<ref name="Jane's"/> production could not start until 1942 owing to the need to get the Hercules into production and improve the reliability of the entire engine line. Nor was there any real need for the larger engine at this early point in the war, when most military aircraft designs were intended to mount engines of 1,000&nbsp;hp or a little more. The Hercules' approximately 1,500&nbsp;hp was simply better suited to the existing airframes then in production.

In fact, the Centaurus did not see any use until near the end of the war, first appearing on an upscaled version of the [[Vickers Wellington]], the [[Vickers Warwick|Warwick]]. Other wartime, or just-postwar, applications included the [[Bristol Brigand]] and [[Bristol Buckmaster|Buckmaster]], [[Hawker Tempest]] and [[Hawker Sea Fury|Sea Fury]], and the [[Blackburn Firebrand]] and [[Blackburn Beverley|Beverley]]. The engine also saw post-war use in civilian airliners, including the ill-fated [[Bristol Brabazon]].

By the end of the war in Europe, around 2,500 examples of the Centaurus had been produced by Bristol.<ref name="Jane's"/>

A projected enlarged capacity version of the Centaurus was designed by [[Roy Fedden]], cylinders were produced for this engine but it was never built. Known as the '''Bristol Orion''' (a name used previously for a variant of the Jupiter engine) this development was also a two-row, 18 cylinder sleeve valve engine with the displacement increased to 4,142&nbsp;cubic inches (67.9 L).<ref>Gunston 2006, p.152.</ref>

==Variants==
The Centaurus was produced in 34 distinct variants ranging from the 2,000 hp (1,490 kW) Centaurus I to the 2,405 hp (1,793 kW) Centaurus 663 for the [[Airspeed Ambassador]] [[airliner]]. The most powerful variants were the 2,625 hp (1,957 kw) Centaurus 170, 173, 660, 661 and 662.<ref>Lumsden 2003, pp.125-128.</ref>
