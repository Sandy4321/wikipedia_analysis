'''Charles Rennie Mackintosh''' ([[June 7]], [[1868]] &ndash; [[December 10]], [[1928]]) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[architect]], [[designer]], and watercolourist who was a designer in the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] and also the main exponent of [[Art Nouveau]] in [[Scotland]].

==Life==
Born in [[Glasgow]], and suffering from a bad foot and eye problems, he was free to discover and draw sketches of a great deal of the Scottish countryside as a child. He attended the former [[Allan Glen's School]]<ref name=scotsman>[http://heritage.scotsman.com/profiles.cfm?cid=1&id=38872005 Scotsman.com <U+2013> Heritage and Culture <U+2013> Charles Rennie Mackintosh]</ref>.  At the age of 16 he was apprenticed to an [[architect]] named John Hutchison, where he worked from 1884 until 1889. Also during that time he became a draughtsman with Honeyman and Keppie, a new architectural practice, eventually becoming a partner in 1901. All along he attended evening classes in [[art]] at the Glasgow School of Art. It was at these classes that he first met [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]] (whom he later married), her sister [[Frances MacDonald]], and [[Herbert MacNair]] who was also a fellow apprentice with Mackintosh at Honeyman and Keppie. The group of artists, known as "The Four," exhibited in Glasgow, London and Vienna, and these exhibitions helped establish Mackintosh's reputation. The so-called "Glasgow" style was exhibited in Europe and influenced the Viennese [[Art Nouveau]] movement known as ''Sezessionstil'' (in English, ''The Secession'') around [[1900]]. 

He joined a firm of architects in [[1889]] and developed his own style: a contrast between strong right angles and floral-inspired decorative motifs with subtle curves, e.g. the Mackintosh Rose motif, along with some references to traditional Scottish [[architecture]]. The project that helped make his international reputation was the [[Glasgow School of Art]] ([[1897]]-[[1909]]).

He died in [[1928]] of [[throat cancer]].

===Unbuilt Mackintosh===
Although moderately popular (for a period) in his native Scotland, most of his more ambitious designs were not built. His designs of various buildings for the [[1901]] [[Glasgow International Exhibition]] were not constructed, as was his "Haus eines Kunstfreundes" ([[House for an Art Lover|Art Lover's House]]) in the same year. He competed in the [[1903]] design competition for [[Liverpool Cathedral]], but lost the commission to [[Giles Gilbert Scott]]. 

Although the House for An Art Lover was subsequently ([[1989]]-[[1996]]) built after his death, Mackintosh left many unbuilt designs.

*Alternative Concert Hall,

Although Mackintosh's architectural output was fairly small he had a considerable influence on European design. Especially popular in Austria and Germany, Mackintosh's work was highly acclaimed when it was shown at the Vienna Secession Exhibition in 1900. It was also exhibited in Budapest, Munich, Dresden, Venice and Moscow.

==Design work and paintings==

Mackintosh also worked in [[interior design]], [[furniture]], [[textile]]s and, [[metalwork]]. Much of this work combines Mackintosh's own designs with those of his wife, whose flowing, floral style complimented his more formal, rectilinear work. Like his contemporary [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], Mackintosh's architectural designs often included extensive specifications for the detailing, decoration, and furnishing of his buildings. His work was shown at the [[Vienna Secession]] Exhibition in [[1900]].

Later in life, disillusioned with architecture, Mackintosh worked largely as a [[watercolour]]ist, painting numerous landscapes and flower studies (often in collaboration with Margaret, with whose style Mackintosh's own gradually converged) in the [[Suffolk]] village of [[Walberswick]] (to which the pair moved in [[1914]]), and where he was arrested as a possible spy in 1915. 

By 1923, he had entirely abandoned architecture and design and moved to the south of [[France]] with Margaret where he concentrated on watercolour painting. He was interested in the relationships between man-made and naturally occurring landscapes. Many of his paintings depict [[Port Vendres]], a small port near the [[Spain|Spanish]] border, and the nearby landscapes.

==Retrospect==

Mackintosh's designs gained in popularity in the decades following his death. His House for an Art Lover was finally built in Glasgow's Bellahouston Park in [[1996]], and the [[University of Glasgow]] (which owns the majority of his watercolour work) rebuilt a terraced house Mackintosh had designed, and furnished it with his and Margaret's work (it is part of the University's [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery|Hunterian Museum]]). The [[Glasgow School of Art]] building (now renamed "The Mackintosh Building") is regularly cited by architectural critics as among the very finest buildings in the UK. The Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society tries to encourage a greater awareness of the work of Mackintosh as an important architect, artist and designer.
