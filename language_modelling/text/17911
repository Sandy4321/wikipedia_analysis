'''State Route 37''' (SR 37) is a primary [[state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Virginia]]. It forms a western bypass of [[Winchester, VA|Winchester]], connecting to [[Interstate 81 (Virginia)|Interstate 81]] at both ends. Although the road is a [[freeway]], neither I-81 connection is freeway standard; the south end (exit 310) is a [[diamond interchange]] with two [[traffic signal]]s, while, at the north end, drivers must use a short piece of [[U.S. Route 11 (Virginia)|U.S. Route 11]] to connect with I-81 at exit 317. In addition to local access, the highway connects to [[U.S. Route 50 (Virginia)|U.S. Route 50]] and [[U.S. Route 522 (Virginia)|U.S. Route 522]], two major highways that lead west and northwest into [[West Virginia]] and north to [[Interstate 70 (Maryland)|Interstate 70]] at [[Hancock, Maryland]]. An eastern bypass, known locally as "Route 37 East", has been proposed in statewide and local plans to complete the loop.<ref>[[Frederick County, Virginia]] Board of Supervisors, [http://www.co.frederick.va.us/boardofsup/Minutes/032702.htm Board Meeting Minutes] of [[March 27]], [[2002]]</ref><ref>Stephanie K.

==Route description==
[[Image:VA37southernTerminus.jpg|thumb|left|Approaching the southern terminus at I-81]]
Route 37 begins at an intersection with Hillandale Road (SR 642), a local [[frontage road]] along the east side of [[I-81 (VA)|I-81]], and Tasker Road (SR 847), which leads southeast to [[US 522 (VA)|US 522]] near [[Armel, Virginia|Armel]]. It immediately crosses I-81 at exit 310, a [[diamond interchange]] with two [[traffic signal]]s on SR 37, and then becomes a [[freeway]], soon junctioning [[US 11 (VA)|US 11]] ([[Valley Pike]]) with a [[partial cloverleaf]]. The next interchange is a diamond at [[Cedar Creek Grade]] (SR 622), and SR 37 reaches its approximate midpoint at [[US 50 (VA)|US 50]] ([[Northwestern Pike]]), another diamond. A [[trumpet interchange]] completed in 2001 connects to the [[Winchester Medical Center]], and the final diamond is with [[US 522 (VA)|US 522]] ([[Frederick Turnpike|Frederick Pike]]) at the northwestern corner. SR 37 ends at a partial Y interchange with [[US 11 (VA)|US 11]] ([[Martinsburg Pike]]), at which SR 37 traffic can only access US 11 north and only traffic from US 11 south can access SR 37, although a northbound exit to Cives Lane was added in about 2000 to allow SR 37 traffic to access US 11 south. About 1/2 mile (1 km) of US 11 is a [[divided highway]], connecting SR 37 with I-81 at exit 317.<ref name=maps>[[Google Maps]] street maps and [[USGS]] [[topographic map]]s, accessed via [http://mapper.acme.com/ ACME Mapper]</ref>

==History==
Route 37 was defined as the proposed '''Winchester By-Pass''' by 1963,<ref>{{CTB minutes|03-1963-01}}, p. 55</ref><!--note that the search returns a few earlier matches, but those are the part of I-81 bypassing Winchester--> and was included in the statewide Arterial Network when it was created in 1964.<ref>{{CTB minutes|03-1964-01}}, p. 27</ref> When [[I-81 (VA)|I-81]] opened past Winchester in November 1965,<ref>[[Virginia Department of Transportation]], [http://www.virginiadot.org/projects/constSTAN-I81-history.asp I-81 History], [[October 29]], [[2006]]</ref> it included an interchange south of Winchester, taking traffic between I-81 and [[US 11 (VA)|US 11]] along a short connecting road.<ref name=USGS-1969>[[United States Geological Survey]], [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/topo/250k/txu-pclmaps-topo-us-cumberland-1969.jpg Cumberland, MD.; W. VA.; PA.; VA.] (scale 1:250,000), 1956, revised 1969</ref> The north half of the bypass, from [[US 50 (VA)|US 50]] west of Winchester north and east to [[US 11 (VA)|US 11]] north of the city, opened in the late 1960s,<ref name=USGS-1969/> and the semicircle was completed in the late 1970s, with the linking of Route 37 to the existing I-81/US 11 connection. A new bridge carrying southbound SR 37 over I-81 was built, but otherwise the [[diamond interchange]] was not modified.<ref name=NBI>[[Federal Highway Administration]], [[National Bridge Inventory]] database, 2006</ref> The only change to the major bypass since it was constructed has been a new [[trumpet interchange]] serving the [[Winchester Medical Center]]; construction began in September 2000<ref>[[Winchester Star]], Long-Awaited Interchange on Way, [[September 22]], [[2000]]</ref> and was completed in November 2001.<ref>[[Winchester Star]], Halseth Enumerates VHS 2001 Growth, [[May 15]], [[2002]]</ref> A single ramp from SR 37 north to Cives Lane, allowing traffic at the north end of the bypass to access US 11 south, was built in about 2000.<!--I wish I could find more details--><ref>[[Frederick County, Virginia]] Board of Supervisors, [http://www.co.frederick.va.us/boardofsup/Minutes/061202.htm Meeting Minutes of 06/12/2002]: "Resolution Re: Changes in the Primary and secondary System Due to relocation, Construction and Right-of-Way Abandonment on Entrance and Exit Ramps on Route 37 at its Intersection with Route 11 North"</ref>
