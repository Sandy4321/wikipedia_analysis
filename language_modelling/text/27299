'''''Halloween II''''' is a 2009 American [[horror film]] written, directed, and produced by [[Rob Zombie]]. The film is a sequel to Zombie's [[Halloween (2007 film)|2007 remake]] of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), and the tenth film in the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' film series]]. Picking up where the 2007 remake ended, and then jumping ahead one year, ''Halloween II'' follows [[Laurie Strode]] as she deals with the aftermath of the previous film's events, [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Loomis]] who is trying to capitalize on those events by publishing a new book that chronicles everything that happened, and [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] as he continues his search for Laurie so that he can reunite with his sister. The film sees the return of lead cast members [[Malcolm McDowell]], [[Scout Taylor-Compton]], and [[Tyler Mane]], who portrayed Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, and Michael Myers in the 2007 film, respectively.

The sequel was first announced at the 30 Years of Terror Convention, which was held in 2008. Shortly after the release of the 2007 remake, Zombie expressed that he was not going to make another ''Halloween'' film. After more than a year of unsuccessful attempts to draft a script for a sequel, [[Bob Weinstein|Bob]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]], and Malek Akkad secured a contract for Zombie, who had a renewed interest in the film, to write and direct. For ''Halloween II'', Zombie decided to focus more on the connection between Laurie and Michael, and the idea they share similar psychological problems. Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor. For the characters of ''Halloween II'', it is about change. Zombie wanted to look at how the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to show the connection between Laurie and Michael, and provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look the director was going for with the film. When it came time to provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble finding a place to include [[John Carpenter]]'s original ''Halloween'' theme music. Although Carpenter's theme was used throughout Zombie's 2007 film, the theme was only included in the final shot of this film.

''Halloween II'' was officially released on August 28, 2009 in [[North America]], and was met with a negative reception from critics. On October 30, 2009 it was re-released in North America to coincide with the [[Halloween]] holiday weekend. The original opening of the film grossed less than the 2007 remake, with approximately $7 million. The film would go on to earn $33,392,973 in North America, with a worldwide total of $38,553,147. ''Halloween II'' was also released on DVD and Blu-ray, with a theatrical version and director's cut of the film offered.

==Plot==
<!--STOP. Wikipedia is not a substitute for watching a movie, and plot summaries should not contain every minor detail. They are here to SUMMARIZE basic events. For a horror movie, that means we don't need to explain how every single character was killed, and what everyone is doing that isn't relevant to the overall plot. Thank you. !-->

<!--In the THEATRICAL version of the film, which THIS describes, the time gap is ONE YEAR, not two.  The two year gap is ONLY IN THE DIRECTOR'S CUT.  Please do not change this.  Thank you.!-->

In a short flashback, Deborah Myers ([[Sheri Moon Zombie]]) visits her son, a young [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] (Chase Wright Vanek), at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Deborah gives Michael a white horse statuette as a gift. Michael says that the horse reminds him of a dream he had of Deborah's ghost, all dressed in white and leading a horse down the sanitarium halls toward Michael, telling him she was going to bring him home. Moving ahead fifteen years, after having shot an adult Michael ([[Tyler Mane]]), [[Laurie Strode]] ([[Scout Taylor-Compton]]) is found wandering around in a state of [[acute stress reaction|shock]] and covered in blood by Sheriff Brackett ([[Brad Dourif]]). Brackett takes Laurie to the [[emergency room]]. Meanwhile, the paramedics pick up the Sheriff's daughter Annie ([[Danielle Harris]]) and Michael's psychiatrist [[Samuel J. Loomis|Dr. Loomis]] ([[Malcolm McDowell]]), who are still alive after having been attacked by Michael, and take them to the hospital. Presumed dead, Michael's lifeless body is loaded into a separate ambulance. When the driver has a [[Traffic collision|traffic accident]] Michael awakens and escapes the ambulance, walking toward a vision of Deborah dressed in white and leading a white horse.

Michael appears at the hospital, and begins murdering everyone he comes across on his way to Laurie. Trapped in a security outpost at the gate, Laurie watches as Michael tears through the walls with an axe, but just as he tries to kill her, Laurie wakes up from the dream. It is actually one year later and Laurie is now living with the Bracketts. Michael's body has been missing since last Halloween<U+2014>still presumed dead<U+2014>and Laurie has been having recurring nightmares about the event. While Laurie deals with her trauma through therapy, Loomis has chosen to turn the event into an opportunity to write another book. Meanwhile, Michael has been having visions of Deborah's ghost and a younger version of himself, who instructs him that with Halloween approaching it is time to bring Laurie home; so he sets off for Haddonfield.

As Michael travels to Haddonfield, Laurie begins having hallucinations that mirror Michael's, which involve a ghostly image of Deborah and a young Michael in a clown costume. In addition, her hallucinations also begin to include her acting out Michael's murders, like envisioning herself taping Annie to a chair and slitting her throat while dressed in a clown outfit<U+2014>similar to how a young Michael murdered Ronnie White. While Laurie struggles with her dreams, Loomis has been going on tour to promote his new book, only to be greeted with criticism from people who blame him for Michael's actions and for exploiting the deaths of Michael's victims. When his book is finally released, Laurie discovers the truth: that she is really Angel Myers, Michael's long lost sister. With the truth out, she decides to go partying with her friends Mya ([[Brea Grant]]) and Harley ([[Angela Trimbur]]) to escape how she is feeling. Michael appears at the party and kills Harley, then makes his way over to the Brackett house and stabs Annie repeatedly.
<!--PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE ENDING TO THAT OF THE DIRECTOR'S CUT. THE PLOT IS SUPPOSED TO REFLECT THE THEATRICAL CUT OF THE FILM. THANK YOU.!-->
When Laurie and Mya arrive they find Annie bloodied and dying. Michael kills Mya and then comes after Laurie, who manages to escape the house. While Laurie manages to flag down a passing motorist, Sheriff Brackett arrives home and finds his daughter dead. Laurie gets into the motorist's car, but before they can escape Michael kills the driver and flips the car over with Laurie still in it. Michael takes the unconscious Laurie to an abandoned shed he has been camping out in. Laurie awakens to a vision of Deborah, and a young Michael, ordering her to say "I love you, mommy". The police discover Michael's location and surround the shed. Loomis arrives and goes into the shed to try to reason Michael into letting Laurie go. Inside, he has to inform Laurie, who believes that the younger Michael is holding her down, that no one is restraining her and that she must maintain her sanity. Just then, Deborah instructs the older Michael that it is time to go home, and Michael grabs Loomis and begins repeatedly slashing his face and stabbing him in the chest. Stepping in front of a window while holding Loomis's body, Michael is shot twice by Sheriff Brackett and falls onto the spikes of some farming equipment. Apparently released of the visions, Laurie walks over and tells Michael she loves him, then she stabs him repeatedly in the chest and finally in the face. The shed door opens and Laurie walks out, wearing Michael's mask. As she pulls the mask off, the scene transitions to Laurie in isolation in a psychiatric ward, grinning as a vision of Deborah dressed in white stands with a white horse at the end of her room.

In 2008, at the 30 Years of Terror Convention, ''Halloween'' producer Malek Akkad confirmed that a sequel to Rob Zombie's 2007 film was in the works. French filmmakers Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Muary were in negotiations to direct the sequel in November 2008,<ref>{{cite web|author=Kevin Powers|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/11/03/more-details-on-the-sequel-to-rob-zombies-halloween/|title=More Details on the Sequel to Rob Zombie's Halloween|publisher=First Showing|work=Dead Central|date=November 3, 2008|accessdate=November 4, 2008}}</ref> but on December 15, 2008 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Rob Zombie had officially signed on to write and direct the ''Halloween'' sequel.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Fleming|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117997402.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title=Zombie making 'Halloween' sequel|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 15, 2008|accessdate=December 16, 2008}}</ref> In an interview, Zombie expressed how the exhaustion of creating the first ''Halloween'' made him not want to come back for a sequel, but after a year of cooling down he was more open to the idea.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Fleming|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117997402.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title=Zombie making 'Halloween' sequel|publisher=Reed Business Information|work=Variety|date=December 15, 2008|accessdate=April 12, 2010}}</ref> The writer/director explained that with the sequel he was no longer bound by a sense of needing to retain any "John Carpenter-ness", as he "felt free to do whatever".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iesb.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7235:interview-rob-zombie-on-halloween-2&catid=44:interviews&Itemid=172|title=Interview: Rob Zombie on Halloween 2|publisher=IESB|author=Christina Radish|date=August 5, 2009|accessdate=April 10, 2010}}</ref> Producer Malek Akkad said the original intention, when they believed Zombie was not returning, was to create a "normal sequel".<ref name="Akkad">{{cite web|author=Ryan Rotten|title=Set Interview: Halloween 2's Malek Akkad|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/interviewsnews.php?id=10392|publisher=Shock Till You Drop|date=May 4, 2009|accessdate=May 4, 2009}}</ref> Akkad and his Trancus producing company hired various writers to come up with drafts for a new film, but none worked. Akkad and the Weinstein brothers then turned to Bustillo and Muary, whose film ''[[Inside (film)|Inside]]'' had recently been bought for distribution by the Weinstein Company. According to Akkad, the producers really wanted Zombie to return, as Akkad felt that there was something "lost in the translation" when the French filmmakers took over the project.<ref name="Akkad"/> After his work on the 2007 remake, Zombie had earned the trust of Akkad, who told him to ignore any rules they had set for him on the previous film. Akkad said that he wanted Zombie to move the franchise away from some of its established rules.<ref name="Akkad"/>

===Characters===
For the sequel, Tyler Mane, Malcolm McDowell, Scout Taylor-Compton, Danielle Harris, Sheri Moon Zombie, and Brad Dourif returned to the roles of Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, Deborah Myers, and Sheriff Brackett, respectively. [[Daeg Faerch]], who portrayed a young Michael Myers in the 2007 remake, was set to reprise his role for ''Halloween II''. By the time production was getting started for the sequel Faerch had grown too big for the part. Zombie had to recast the role, much to his own dismay, because Faerch's physical maturity did not fit what was in the script. Although Faerch is not in the sequel, the first trailer for Halloween II contained images of Faerch. Zombie pointed out that those images were test shots done and were not intended to be in either the trailer or the film.<ref name="Zombieint"/>

The actress stated that Zombie wanted to see Laurie Strode travel into "these really dark places".<ref name="Scoutint"/> Taylor-Compton clarified that when the film starts Laurie is still not aware that Michael is her older brother, and as the film progresses more and more pieces of information are given to her and she does not know how to deal with them. The actress explained that the darkness brewing inside Laurie is manifested externally, generally through her physical appearance and the clothes she chooses to wear<U+2014>Zombie characterized the look as "grungy".<ref name="Scoutint"/>

Zombie further described Laurie as a "wreck", who continually sinks lower as the film moves forward.<ref>{{cite web|author=Scott Collura|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/963/963622p3.html|title=Exclusive: The Shape of H2 (page 3)|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|work=</i>[[IGN]]<i>|accessdate=March 22, 2009}}</ref> Even Sheriff Brackett goes through changes.

Laurie; Loomis; they're having all kinds of problems in their life, but Michael just moves along.

===Music===
For the sequel, Zombie only used John Carpenter's original theme music in the final scene of the film, though the director admits that he and music composer Tyler Bates tried to find other places to include it. According to Zombie, Carpenter's music did not fit with what was happening in the film; whenever he or Bates would insert it into a scene it "just wouldn't feel right" to the director.<ref name="Zombievid"/> Zombie also used popular culture songs throughout the film, with "[[Nights in White Satin]]" appearing the most prominently.

Rob Nelson, of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', felt the use of Deborah and the white horse was nothing more than "silly", and he disagreed with Zombie's choice to film ''Halloween II'' in 16mm film, as opposed to wider format of 35mm that he used on his 2007 remake. Nelson also stated that the hospital scene was nothing more than a "butcher"-version of Carpenter's 1981 sequel, with the rest of the film feeling like it was rushed and "slapped together" at the last minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117940908.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|author=Rob Nelson|publisher=Reed Business Information|work=Variety|title=''Halloween II'' review|date=August 28, 2009|accessdate=April 12, 2010}}</ref> In contrast, ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' believed the hospital scene at the start of the film "[bested the 1981 sequel] in just about every respect". ''Time Out'' stated that Compton's portrayal of Laurie Strode showed an "intense, nontrivializing dedication to the role" that kept interest, while the storyline of Dr. Loomis's egocentricity hinders the overall storyline. ''Time Out'' also said that Zombie hurt the film by trying to show how "violence lingers with, and perverts, all who are touched by it", but then undercutting himself with "carnivalesque" violence.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://newyork.timeout.com/articles/film/77981/halloween-ii-film-review|journal=[[Time Out (company)|''Time Out'']]|title=''Halloween II'' review|issue=727|date=September 3-9, 2009|accessdate=April 12, 2010}}</ref> Although the ''[[New York Post]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Kyle Smith did not believe the character of Laurie Strode was a balance for Michael Myers or Dr. Loomis, he agreed the ghostly images of Deborah Myers were a "relief from the blood-streaked brutality" of Michael's murders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/horror_show_shtick_or_treat_7abHvNpV5DcQoYdfJZickK|title=Horror-Show Shtick or Treat|author=Kyle Smith|publisher=News Corporation|work=[[New York Post]]|date=September 2, 2009|accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref>

''[[The Boston Globe]]'s'' Tom Russo had varied reactions to the film. Russo pointed out that Zombie attempted to be more inventive with ''Halloween II'', but only achieved mixed results for his efforts. Russo referred to the dream sequences of Deborah Myers and the white horse as "pretentiously silly", but agreed that the scenes did help to break up the standard genre violence and even went so far as to compare the sensation created by those scenes to "[[Tim Burton]] doing straight horror". In the end, Russo claimed that "only the most hardcore fans" would want the film series to continue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2009/08/29/halloween_sequel_has_few_treats/|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|title=<U+2018>Halloween<U+2019> sequel has few treats|author=Tom Russo|date=August 29, 2009|accessdate=April 12, 2010}}</ref> Joe Neumaier, of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', stated that Zombie has found himself with ''Halloween II''. Neumaier describes the film as a successful "'character-based' monster-flick". Zombie's use of music from the 1970s, like [[The Moody Blues]]' "[[Nights in White Satin]] and [[10cc]]'s "The Things We Do For Love", is "terrifically odd" throughout the film. Neumaier also said that the imagery of Deborah Myers and the "ethereal white horse" were a "nice visual relief" from Michael's violent attacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2009/08/28/2009-08-28_halloween_ii_.html|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|title='Halloween II' scares up surprisingly good stab at redefining slasher genre by director Rob Zombie|date=August 28, 2009|accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref>
