The '''polka''' is a fast, lively Central European [[dance]] and also a [[musical genre|genre]] of [[dancing music|dance music]] familiar throughout Europe and the Americas. It originated in the middle of the 19th century in [[Bohemia]] and is still a common genre in [[Czech Republic|Czech]] and [[Slovakian]] [[folk music]]. Polka is still a very common folkmusic genre in Poland. In light classical music, many polkas were composed by both [[Johann Strauss I]] and his son [[Johann Strauss II]]; a couple of well-known ones were composed by [[Bed<U+0159>ich Smetana]], and [[Jarom<U+00ED>r Vejvoda]], the author of "<U+0160>koda l<U+00E1>sky" ("[[Beer Barrel Polka|Roll Out the Barrel]]").

The name comes from the [[Czech language|Czech]] word ''p<U+016F>lka'' &ndash; literally, "little half" &ndash; a reference to the short half-steps featuring in the dance. The word's familiar form has been influenced by the similarity to the Czech word ''polka'', meaning "Polish woman".<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=polka&searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary, "polka"]; [http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/polka Compact Oxford English Dictionary, "polka"]</ref> The name has led to the dance's origin being sometimes mistakenly attributed to Poland. It should also not be confused with the [[Polska (dance)|''polska'']], a [[Sweden|Swedish]] {{audio|3-4_rhythm_metre_meter_time_measure.ogg|3/4-beat}} dance with Polish roots; cf. [[polka-mazurka]]. A related dance is the [[redowa]]. Polkas almost always have a {{audio|2-4_rhythm_metre_meter_time_measure.ogg|2/4}} [[Metre (music)|time signature]]. [[Popular music]] has also been parodied several times by [[Weird Al Yankovic]] in the style of polka.

==Styles==
There are various styles of contemporary polka. One of the types found in the United States is the North American "Polish-style polka," which has roots in [[Chicago]]; two sub-styles are the 'Chicago honky' (using clarinet and one trumpet) and 'Chicago push' featuring the accordion, [[Chemnitzer concertina]], bass, drums, and (almost always) two trumpets.  North American "[[Slovenian-style polka]]" is fast and features piano [[accordion]], chromatic accordion, and/or [[diatonic button accordion]]; it is associated with [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]. In the USA, Slovenian-style is sometimes called "Eastern Style", associating it with the eastern US.  North American "Dutchman-style" features an [[oom-pah]] sound often with a [[tuba]], and has roots in the American [[Midwest]].  "[[Conjunto]]-style" polkas have roots in Northern [[Mexico]], [[Texas]], and is also called "[[Norte<U+00F1>o (music)|Norte<U+00F1>o]]".  Traditional dances from this region reflect the influence of polka-dancing European immigrants. In the 1980s and 1990s, several bands began to combine polka with various [[rock and roll|rock]] styles (sometimes referred to as "[[Punk rock|punk]] polka"), "[[alternative rock|alternative]] polka", or "[[San Francisco]]-style". "Duranguense" polka from [[Durango]] is another Mexican type of music. This uses electric guitars, violins, drums, saxophones, trombones, keyboards, trumpets, tuba-keyboards or a bass guitar, and it is in a rapid beat. Artists like Grupo Montez De Durango, Alacranes Musical, Horoscopos De Durango, Conjunto Atardecer, K-paz De La Sierra are well known to the genre. Irish traditional music has also adopted the polka into its repertory, and there it has come into its own distinct flavor. 

There also exist Peruvian polcas (becoming very popular in [[Lima]]). In the [[pampas]] of Argentina, the "polca" has a very very fast beat with a 3/4 compass. Instruments used are: acoustic guitar (usually six strings, but sometimes seven strings), electric or acoustic bass (sometimes fretless), accordion (sometimes piano accordion, sometimes button accordion), and sometimes some percussion is used. The lyrics always praise the [[gaucho]] warriors from the past or tell about the life of the [[gaucho]] campeiros (provincial gauchos who keep the common way).

==The polka in the classical repertoire==

[[Bed<U+0159>ich Smetana]] incorporated the polka in his opera ''[[The Bartered Bride]]'' ({{lang-cz|'''Prodan<U+00E1> nev<U+011B>sta'''}}) and in particular, Act 1.  

While the polka is Bohemian in origin, most dance music composers in [[Vienna]] (the capital of the vast [[Habsburg]] [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], which was the cultural centre for music from all over the empire) composed polkas and included the dance in their repertoire at some point of their career. The [[Strauss]] family in Vienna for example, while probably better-known for their [[waltz]]es also composed polkas which have survived obscurity. [[Josef Lanner]] and other Viennese composers in the 19th century also wrote many polkas to satiate the demands of the dance music-loving Viennese. In [[France]], another dance-music composer [[Emile Waldteufel]] also wrote many polkas in addition to his chief profession of penning waltzes.

The polka evolved during the same period into different styles and tempi. In principle, the polka written in the 19th century has a 4-theme structure; themes 1A and 1B as well as a 'Trio' section of a further 2 themes. The 'Trio' usually has an 'Intrada' to form a break between the two sections. The feminine and graceful 'French polka' (polka fran<U+00E7>aise) is slower in tempo and is more measured in its gaiety. Johann Strauss II's [[Annen Polka]] op. 114, [[Demolirer]] polka op. 269, the [[Im Krapfenwald'l]] op. 336 and the [[Bitte sch<U+00F6>n!]] polka op. 372 are examples of this type of polka. The [[polka-mazurka]] is also another variation of the polka, being in the tempo of a [[mazurka]] but danced in a similar manner as the polka. The final category of the polka dating around that time would be the 'polka schnell' which is a fast polka or ''[[galop]]''. It is in this final category [[Eduard Strauss]] is better known, as he penned the 'Bahn Frei' polka op. 45 and other examples. Earlier, [[Johann Strauss I]] and Josef Lanner wrote polkas which are either designated as a ''galop'' (quick tempo) or as a regular polka which may not fall into any of the categories described above. 

The polka was also a further source of inspiration for the Strauss family in Vienna when it was written only for plucked string instruments ([[pizzicato]]) resulting in the well-known 'Pizzicato Polka' jointly written by Johann II and Josef Strauss. Johann II also wrote a later 'New Pizzicato Polka' (Neu Pizzicato-Polka) op. 449 culled from music of his [[operetta]] 'F<U+00FC>rstin Ninetta'. Much earlier, he also wrote a 'joke-polka' ([[German language|German]] "scherz-polka") entitled 'Champagne-Polka' op. 211 which evokes the uncorking of champagne bottles.

Other composers who wrote music in the style of the polka were [[Jarom<U+00ED>r Weinberger]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]].

==Organizations in the United States of America==
The [[International Polka Association]] based in [[Chicago]], USA works to preserve the cultural heritage of polka music and to honor its musicians through the Polka Hall of Fame.

The United States Polka Association is based in Cleveland, Ohio, and the Polka America Corporation<ref>http://www.polkaamericacorporation.org</ref> is a non-profit organization based out of Ringle, Wisconsin.

[[Grammy Awards]] were first presented for polka in 1985. The first award went to America's Polka King, [[Frank Yankovic]], for his "70 Years of Hits" album on [[Cleveland International Records]], produced by [[Joey Miskulin]] and Dragutin Razum in 1986. [[Cleveland International Records]] had another Polka [[Grammy]] winner with [[Brave Combo's]] Polkasonic in 1999. Other Polka [[Grammy]] nominees on [[Cleveland International Records]] include Frank Yankovic's "America's Favorites" (1986), "Songs of the Polka King Vol. I" (Produced by [[Joey Miskulin]] and Slavko Slivovitz, 1996), "Songs of the Polka King Vol. II" (1997), and [[Brave Combo's]] "Kick Ass Polkas" (2000).  [[Jimmy Sturr]] & His Orchestra is arguably the most popular polka band in America, having won 17 out of the 23 [[Grammy Awards]] given for [[Grammy Award for Best Polka Album]].

''Polka Varieties'' was an hour-long television program of polka music originating from [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. It was the only television program for this type of music in the US. From 1956 to 1975, ''Polka Varieties'' ran solely in [[WEWS-TV]], Cleveland, on Sunday afternoons from 1:00 to 2:00, and was syndicated during its later years to 30 television markets. The program featured various popular Polish, Slovenian, Italian, and Bohemian-style bands. America's "Polka King" Frank Yankovic was the original band to perform on the show. Other bands included Richie Vadnal, George Staiduhar, Markic-Zagger, and Hank Haller. Original host Tom Fletcher was replaced by Paul Wilcox, whose presence became an indelible part of the show.<ref>http://www.newsnet5.com/newschannel5/913419/detail.html]</ref>
