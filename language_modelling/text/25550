'''Magnolia Hall'''  is an historic [[plantation]] located in the [[High Hills of Santee]] at 2025 Horatio-Hagood Road, [[Hagood, South Carolina|Hagood]], [[South Carolina]] in the [[United States]]. Its [[Greek Revival]] plantation house was built in 1821 by its owner Isaac Barnes and added onto in 1855 and 1860 by  Dr. Swepson Saunders, who had bought the property in 1853. 

Magnolia Hall was threatened with destruction by [[Union Army|Union troops]] in April, 1865, under the command of Brigadier General Edward E. Potter,
but apparently was saved by the actions of Dr. Saunder's slave cook in feeding the troops when they appeared. Dr. Saunders, who apparently had taken refuge somewhere between Magnolia Hall and [[Stateburg, South Carolina|Stateburg]], wrote to his wife that he had seen the burning houses in Stateburg and had expected to see their own house burning.<ref>Anderson, Christy, nomination form for Magnolia Hall, accessible by Internet Explorer through the link found at [http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/sumter/S10817743009/index.htm South Carolina Department of Archives and History file on Magnolia Hall]</ref>
