A [[format war]] took place in 2002 - 2008 between the [[Blu-ray Disc]] and [[HD DVD]] [[optical disc]] standards for storing [[High-definition video|high definition]] video and audio.

These standards emerged between 2000 and 2003 and attracted both the mutual and exclusive support of major [[consumer electronics]] manufacturers, [[personal computer]] manufacturers, television and movie producers and distributors, and software developers.

Blu-ray and HD DVD players became commercially available starting in 2006.  In early 2008, the war was decided when several studios and distributors shifted to Blu-ray disc. On February 19, 2008, [[Toshiba]] officially announced that it would stop the development of the HD DVD [[DVD player|players]], conceding the format war to the Blu-ray Disc format.<ref name="Toshiba announcement">{{cite news|url=http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2008_02/pr1903.htm  |title=Toshiba Announces Discontinuation of HD DVD Businesses |date=February 19, 2008 |publisher=Toshiba}}</ref>

==Background==
The Blu-ray/HD DVD conflict resembled the earlier [[videotape format war]] between [[VHS]] and [[BetaMax]], partly because  of [[Sony]]'s strong involvement in both episodes. These format wars have often proved destructive to both camps because consumers, afraid of committing to a losing standard, will refrain from purchasing either.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dranove |first=David |coauthors=Neil Gandal |title=Surviving a Standards War: Lessons Learned from the Life and Death of DIVX |publisher=Idea Group Inc.}}</ref> Format wars have been avoided in notable cases such as the [[DVD Forum]] for the unified [[DVD]] standard, the [[Grand Alliance (HDTV)|Grand Alliance]] for the [[HDTV]] standard, and the Wi-Fi Alliance for [[Wi-Fi|wireless networking]] standards.

The emergence of high definition players followed the entry of [[HDTV]] televisions into the mainstream market in the mid-2000s. Consumer-grade high definition players required an inexpensive storage medium capable of holding the larger amount of data needed for HD video.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB891992681208651500.html?mod=googlewsj |title= In HDTV Age, Successor to VCR Still Seems to Be a Long Way Off |accessdate=2007-10-18 |author=Evan Ramstad |date=1998-04-08 |work=online.wsj.com}}</ref> The breakthrough came with [[Shuji Nakamura]]'s invention of the [[blue laser|blue laser diode]], whose shorter wavelength opened the door to higher density [[optical media]] following a six year [[Patent infringement|patent dispute]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,103862-page,1/article.html |title=Opening the Door for New Storage Options |accessdate=2007-10-18 |author=Martyn Williams |date=2002-08-12 |work=pcworld.com |publisher=}}</ref>

Sony started two projects applying the new diodes: [[Ultra Density Optical]] and, with [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]], DVR Blue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.planetanalog.com/features/OEG20010615S0046 |title=Blue laser bolsters DTV storage, features |accessdate=2007-10-19 |author=S.B.

The DVD Forum, chaired by [[Toshiba]], was deeply split over whether to go with the more expensive blue lasers, whose discs initially required a protective caddy to avoid mis-handling, making the medium more expensive and physically different from DVDs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1829241.stm |title=Next Generation DVD Born |accessdate=2007-11-04 |date=2002-02-21 |work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> In March 2002, the forum voted to approve a proposal endorsed by [[Warner Bros.]] and other [[film studio|motion picture studios]] that involved compressing HD content onto dual-layer [[DVD-9]] discs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20020301S0091 |title=Picture's fuzzy for DVD |accessdate=2007-10-19 |author=Junko Yoshida |date=2002-03-01 |work=eetimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20011212S0060 |title=Forum to weigh Microsoft's Corona as DVD encoder |accessdate=2007-10-19 |author=Junko Yoshida |date=2001-12-12 |work=eetimes.com |publisher=}}</ref> In spite of this decision, the DVD Forum's Steering Committee announced in April 2002 that it was pursuing its own blue-laser high-definition solution.

The competing standards had [[Comparison of high definition optical disc formats|significant differences]] that made each incompatible with the other.

==Attempts to avoid a format war==
In an attempt to avoid a costly format war, the Blu-ray Disc Association and DVD Forum started to negotiate a compromise in early 2005. One of the issues was that Blu-ray's supporters wanted to use a Java-based platform for interactivity ([[BD-J]]), while the DVD Forum was promoting [[Microsoft]]'s "iHD" (which became [[HDi Interactive Format|HDi]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eetasia.com/ART_8800364355_499495_f3313299.HTM |title=Sides close to deal on HD disk format |accessdate=2007-10-19 |author=Junko Yoshida |date=2005-04-19 |work=eetasia.com |publisher=}}</ref> A much larger issue, though, was the physical formats of the discs themselves; the Blu-ray Disc Association's member companies did not want to risk losing billions of dollars in royalties as they had done with standard DVD.<ref name="stalemate">{{cite web |url=http://www.internetnews.com/storage/article.php/3671091 |title=Who Is Drawing Out The High-Def DVD Stalemate? |accessdate=2007-10-19 |author=Andy Patrizio |date=2007-04-12 |work=internetnews.com |publisher=}}</ref> An agreement seemed close, but negotiations proceeded slowly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8e6df286-c670-11d9-b69b-00000e2511c8.html |title=Sony-Toshiba DVD format talks stall |accessdate=2007-10-19 |author=Michiyo Nakamoto |date=2005-05-17 |work=ft.com |publisher=}}</ref>

At the end of June 2005, [[Sun Microsystems]], the developer of [[Java (programming language)|Java]], announced that the Blu-ray Association had chosen the Java-based BD-J interactivity layer instead of Microsoft's [[HDi Interactive Format|HDi]]. This was based on a BDA board vote favouring BD-J 10 to 4, despite a technical committee previously favoring HDi by a vote of 7 to 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6281492.html|title=Micro-managed copies}}</ref> At the same time, Microsoft and Toshiba jointly announced that they would cooperate in developing high-definition DVD players.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2005/06/68009 |title=Microsoft, Toshiba Gear Up |accessdate=2007-10-19 |author=David Cohn |date=2005-06-27 |work=wired.com |publisher=}}</ref> In a top-level meeting in July, Microsoft's Bill Gates argued that the Blu-ray standard had to change to "work more smoothly with personal computers".

On August 22, 2005, the Blu-ray Disc Association and DVD Forum announced that the negotiations to unify their standards had failed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/home/feeds/afx/2005/08/22/afx2188394.html |title=Sony, Toshiba fail to unify DVD format - report |accessdate=2007-10-19 |author= |date=2005-08-22 |work=forbes.com |publisher= |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> Rumors surfaced that talks had stalled; publicly, the same reasons of physical format incompatibility were cited.<ref name="stalemate"/><ref name="DaggersDrawn"/> In the end of September, Microsoft and [[Intel]] jointly announced their support for HD DVD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/n6BNgaGjf2Pdrz/Microsoft-Intel-Back-Toshibas-HD-DVD.xhtml |title=Microsoft, Intel Back Toshiba's HD-DVD |accessdate=2007-10-19 |author=Susan B.

[[Hewlett Packard]] (HP) proposed an ultimatum for the Blu-ray Disc Association: adopt Microsoft's [[vendor lock-in|proprietary]] [[HDi Interactive Format|HDi]] (instead of the Java based system) and a mandatory managed copy feature, or HP would support HD DVD instead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2144325/hp-calls-changes-blu-ray |title=HP calls for changes to Blu-ray |accessdate=2007-10-19 |author=Ken Young |date=2005-10-20 |work=vnunet.com}}</ref> In a research report, Gartner analysts Van Baker, Laura Behrens and Mike McGuire wrote that if HP's proposal were accepted, Blu-ray would become the winner of the format war.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2144595/hp-blu-ray-move-spells-doom-hd |title=HP's Blu-ray move spells doom for HD-DVD |accessdate=2007-10-19 |author=Robert Jaques |date=2005-10-25 |work=vnunet.com}}</ref> Though the Blu-ray Disc group did add mandatory managed copy to Blu-ray, they did not add HDi.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,175904,00.html |title=Blu-ray Won't Bow to HP's Demands |accessdate=2007-10-19 |date=2005-11-17 |work=foxnews.com}}</ref>

==Alliances==
The [[Blu-ray Disc Foundation]] was formed by [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]], [[LG Electronics|LG]], [[Panasonic]], [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]], [[Philips]], [[Samsung]], [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]], [[Sony]], and [[Thomson SA|Thomson]] on May 20, 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/200205/02-0520E/|title=Disclosure of Specifications for Large Capacity Optical Disc Recording Format Utilizing Blue-Violet Laser Blu-ray Disc Begins (May 20, 2002)}}</ref> Other early supporters included [[Dell]], [[HP]], [[Mitsubishi]] and [[TDK]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tdk.co.jp/teaah01/aah13400.htm|title=Blu-ray Disc Founders Open the Door for Blu-ray Disc Association To Welcome New Members

[[Acer (company)|Acer]], [[Alpine Electronics|Alpine]], [[Asus]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Hitachi Maxell]], [[Kenwood Electronics|Kenwood]], [[Lanix]], [[LG Electronics|LG]], [[Lite-On]], [[Meridian Audio, Ltd.|Meridian]], [[Onkyo]] and [[Samsung Group|Samsung]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=38952|title=Blu-ray Samsung backs HD DVD - Foot in both camps (April 16, 2007)}}</ref> provided non-exclusive support.

[[Toshiba]], [[Nippon Electric Corporation|NEC]], [[Sanyo]], [[Memory-Tech Corporation]] started [[HD DVD Promotion Group]]<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2004_09/pr2702.htm|title=New HD DVD Promotion Group to Expedite Commercialization of HD DVD Hardware and Software (September 27, 2004)}}</ref> on September 27, 2004. It also included [[Microsoft]], [[RCA]], [[Intel]], Venturer Electronics. In Europe, HD DVD was supported either exclusively or non-exclusively by Medusa Home Entertainment, [[Studio Canal]], Universum Films, Kinowelt Home Entertainment, DVD International, [[Opus Arte]], MK2, Momentum Pictures, Twister Home Video, among others.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

During the height of the format war, some studios supported both formats, including [[Paramount Pictures]] (including subsidiaries [[Nickelodeon Movies]], [[MTV Films]], [[DreamWorks Pictures]] and [[DreamWorks Animation]]), [[BBC]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/35662/98/|title=BBC says it will still support both high-def formats}}</ref> [[First Look Studios]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.highdefdigest.com/tags/show/First_Look|title=First Look Brings 'King of California,' 'Amateur' to HD DVD; Adds Blu-ray Support}}</ref> [[Image Entertainment]] (including the [[Discovery Channel]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Disc_Announcements/Discovery_Channel/TV_on_DVD/Discovery_Channel_Brings_Atlas_to_Blu-ray,_HD_DVD/261|title=Discovery Channel Brings 'Atlas' to Blu-ray, HD DVD}}</ref> [[Magnolia Pictures]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Disc_Announcements/Magnolia/Psst!_Magnolia_Jumps_Into_Blu-ray_with_Bubble/265| title=Psst!

==Deciding factors==
The format war's resolution in favor of Blu-ray was primarily decided by two factors: shifting business alliances, including decisions by major film studios and retail distributors,<ref>{{cite news | first=Yuri | last=Kageyama | coauthors= | title=Toshiba quits HD DVD business | date=2008-02-19 | publisher= | url =http://goldderbyforums.latimes.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/5626090474/m/446106051 | agency =Associated Press | pages = | accessdate = 2008-03-25 | language = | work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> and Sony's decision to include a Blu-ray player in the [[PlayStation 3]] [[video game console]].<ref name="PS3 Times"/><ref name="PS3 BBC"/>

===Studio, distributor alliances===
Studio alliances shifted over time. Before October 2005 and the release of either format, each had the exclusive support of three of the [[Major film studio#Today's Big Six|Big Six]]. HD DVD had Universal Studios, Paramount Pictures, and Warner Brothers Pictures, while Blu-ray Disc started out with Columbia Pictures, Walt Disney Pictures, and 20th Century Fox. Disney and Fox were both impressed by the extra DRM (BD+ and region coding) that the Blu-ray Disc format provided on paper (actually, BD+ and region coding were both cracked in their first year{{fact|date=November 2012}}).  Then HD DVD supporters Warner Bros. and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] added support for Blu-ray.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2005/tc2005105_6128_tc024.htm |title=A Warner Bros. Green Light for Blu-ray? |accessdate=2008-01-14 |last=Grover |first=Ronald |coauthors=Peter Burrows, Cliff Edwards |date=2005-10-05 |work=BusinessWeek }}</ref> But in August 2007, after supporting Blu-ray for over a year, Paramount announced it would release all high-definition content (except titles directed by [[Steven Spielberg]]) exclusively on HD DVD. At the same time, DreamWorks Animation SKG, which had not released any high-definition discs, announced it would release exclusively on HD DVD. Explaining their decisions, the companies cited perceived advantages to HD DVD's technology and lower manufacturing costs. The companies together received about $150 million in cash and promotional guarantees, including a Toshiba HD DVD marketing campaign with a tie-in to ''[[Shrek the Third]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viacom.com/NEWS/NewsText.aspx?RID=1042073|title=Paramount and DreamWorks Animation Each Declare Exclusive Support for HD DVD}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Brooks | last=Barnes | coauthors= | title=Two Studios to Support HD DVD Over Rival | date=2007-08-21 | publisher= | url =http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/21/technology/21disney.html | work =New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-13 }}</ref>

By August 2007, HD DVD appeared to have a modicum of fight left in it, as it was seeing its highest sales (though still substantially lower than Blu-ray), had support from major big-box retailers such as [[Wal-Mart]] due to low prices, and had the exclusive support of studios such as [[Paramount Pictures]], [[DreamWorks SKG]]/[[DreamWorks Animation|Animation]], [[Universal Studios]] and several Indie film studios. The format also had non-exclusive though favorable support (through occasional HD DVD exclusive titles) from [[Warner Bros.]], the largest home video releaser.

The fatal blow came on January 4, 2008 when [[Warner Bros.]], which has the largest market share of DVDs, announced plans to drop HD DVD support completely as of the beginning of June 2008. At the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in Las Vegas, some HD DVD-related events and private meetings with analysts and retailers were canceled, including an event scheduled for the eve of the show sponsored by the North American HD DVD Promotional Group. Toshiba management expressed disappointment over Warner's decision but said that Toshiba would continue promoting the competing format.<ref>{{cite news | first=Richard Waters | last=Waters | coauthors= Paul Taylor , Mariko Sanchanta | title=Sony DVD move deals blow to Microsoft | date=2006-01-06 | publisher= | url =http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9086260c-bc8a-11dc-bcf9-0000779fd2ac.html | work =Financial Times | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-06 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Toshiba Defiant After HD DVD Setback | date=2008-01-06 | publisher= | url =http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iA0y8iwFYWXZBt84MP_jrLjyVCsgD8U0JK4O0 | agency =Associated Press | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-06 }}{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}</ref> The following Monday, Toshiba reduced the price of its HD DVD players by 40 to 50 percent, calling price a "deal breaker for the mainstream consumer".<ref>{{cite news | first= Yinka| last= Adegoke| coauthors= | title=Toshiba cuts HD player prices in Blu-ray fight | date=2008-01-14 | publisher= | url =http://www.reuters.com/article/industryNews/idUSN1441663320080115 | work =Reuters | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-15 }}</ref> At the time, analyst Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates likened the price cut to the high-stakes [[Blackjack]] bet of "[[Blackjack#Player decisions|doubling down]]" in an effort to increase market share and "win back the studios".<ref>{{cite news | first=Michelle | last=Kessler | coauthors= | title=Toshiba turns up heat in DVD war with big price cut | date=2008-01-14 | publisher= | url =http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2008-01-14-toshibe-hd-dvd-prices_N.htm | work =USA Today | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-15 }}</ref> Richard Greenfield of Pali Capital called the move a gimmick and predicted that HD DVD would not become widely adopted.<ref>{{cite news | first=Chinmei | last=Sung | coauthors= Andy Fixmer | title=Toshiba Cuts Retail Prices of HD DVD Players by 50% | date=2008-01-14 | publisher= | url =http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&sid=a5pdEhG3.wuA&refer=japan | work =Bloomberg | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-15 }}</ref> [[Gartner]] analyst Hiroyuki Shimizu predicted that while the price cut might extend HD DVD's life somewhat, the limited title library would ultimately "inflict fatal damage on the format", leaving Blu-ray the victor by the end of 2008.<ref>{{cite news | first=Dan | last=Nystedt | coauthors= | title=Gartner: HD DVD Price Cuts Only Prolong Agony | date=2008-01-28 | publisher= | url =http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,141869-c,dvdtechnology/article.html | work =PC World | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-31 }}</ref>

Warner Bros.' sister studio [[New Line Cinema]] followed suit, canceling tentative plans to release titles on HD DVD.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/New_Line/Industry_Trends/New_Line_Details_Transition_to_Blu-ray/1351 |title=New Line Details Transition to Blu-ray |publisher=High-Def Digest |date=2008-01-08 |accessdate=2008-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hddvd.com/go.php/region-coding-delays-the-hd-dvd-release-of-new-line%e2%80%99s-hairspray/|title=hddvd.com - New line titles delayed for HD DVD due to lack of region coding}}</ref> Other small studios and producers moving exclusively to Blu-ray included [[National Geographic Society]], [[Constantin Film]], and [[Digital Playground]].<ref>[http://www.homemediamagazine.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?sec_id=2&&article_ID=12112 homemediamagazine.com]</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/04/did-warner-brothers-just-kill-hd-dvd/index.html?hp |title=Did Warner Bros.

Warner's move also caused a chain reaction among DVD distributors, most prominently in the form of [[Wal-Mart]]'s February 15, 2008 decision to phase HD DVD out completely by June 2008.<ref>[http://www.walmartfacts.com/articles/5673.aspx Wal-Mart - Wal-Mart Moving Exclusively Toward Blu-ray Format Movies and Players]</ref> Wal-Mart is the largest DVD retailer in the United States, and its decision prompted the ''New York Times'' to run a mock obituary for the HD DVD format.

===PlayStation 3===

Sony's decision to incorporate a Blu-ray Disc player as a standard feature of the [[PlayStation 3]] video game console also helped ensure the format's eventual triumph.<ref name="PS3 BBC">{{cite news | first=Will | last=Smale | coauthors= | title=How the PS3 led Blu-ray's triumph | date=2008-02-19 | publisher= | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7252506.stm| work =BBC News | pages = | accessdate = 2008-02-23 }}</ref> By the time Toshiba ceded the market, about 10.5 million of the Sony consoles had been sold worldwide versus an estimated 1 million HD DVD players <U+2013> including both standalone units and the add-on player for [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox 360]] console, which did not use the HD DVD add-on for gaming unlike the PS3 which had games that used the Blu-ray's added storage capacity.  This equipment gap was a factor in Blu-ray titles (including the ones bundled with the PS3) outselling their HD DVD counterparts two to one in the United States and three or four to one in Europe.

Sony's strategy came at a cost. The company initially priced the PlayStation 3 at $599, roughly double the price of the PlayStation 2 and substantially higher than competing consoles.  Despite this, the PS3 nonetheless sold at an estimated loss of more than US$200 per unit, resulting in losses estimated at about $3 billion.  But analysts, such as Richard Cooper with Screen Digest, expect Sony to recoup far more than that, through the sale of games on the system.<ref name="PS3 Times">{{cite news | first=Dan | last=Sabbagh | coauthors= | title=How the Blu-ray war was won - Sony outspent, outsold Toshiba | date=2008-02-21 | publisher= | url =http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article3405959.ece | work =[[The Times]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-02-23  | location=London}}</ref>

Toshiba's pull-out did not have an immediate significant effect on stand-alone Blu-ray player sales, which rose 2 percent from February to March 2008, after falling 40 percent between January and February, according to NPD Group.  NPD noted that [[upconverting]] DVD player sales rose 5 percent in the first quarter of 2008 over the same quarter of 2007 but did not release a comparison of first quarter Blu-ray sales compared to the same quarter of 2007. At the time of the report, upconverting DVD players cost around $70 versus $300 for Blu-ray players.<ref>{{cite news | first=Eric | last=Taub | coauthors= | title=Blu-ray: The Future Has Been Delayed | date=2008-04-30 | publisher= | url =http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/30/blu-ray-the-future-has-been-delayed/index.html?ref=technology | work =The New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2008-04-30 | language = }}</ref> But in spring 2009, the number of Blu-ray players nearly doubled its year to date 2009 sales over the same period 2008: about 9 million high-definition units sold in the U.S. from January through March, up from the 4.8 million that sold during first-quarter 2008, according to Adams Media Research.
