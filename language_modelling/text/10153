'''Shaw and Crompton''' is a town and [[civil parish]] within the [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham]], in [[Greater Manchester]], [[England]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer">{{cite web |url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/guides/gazette/gazframe.htm |title=A select gazetteer of local government areas, Greater Manchester County|author=Anon|publisher=[[Greater Manchester County Records Office]]|accessdate=2007-06-20|date=[[2003]]-[[07-31]]}}</ref> It lies {{convert|8.7|mi|km|1}} to the northeast of the city of [[Manchester]], {{convert|2.3|mi|km|1}} north of [[Oldham]], and {{convert|3.6|mi|km|1}} southeast of [[Rochdale]].

[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] a part of [[Lancashire]], Shaw and Crompton rose to prominence during the [[Industrial Revolution]] as a major centre of [[Spinning (textiles)|cotton spinning]] and [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile manufacturing]] in the 19th century. According to the national press, it had more [[millionaire]]s per capita at its zenith than any other town in the world.
 
Today, Shaw and Crompton, which covers {{convert|4.5|sqmi|sqkm|1}}, is a predominantly residential town of mixed affluence with a population of 21,721. The legacy of its industrial past can be seen in its six surviving [[cotton mill]]s, all of which are home to large distribution companies, among them [[Littlewoods Shop Direct Group]]'s [[Shaw National Distribution Centre]], which is a major employer in the area.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name Shaw is [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] in origin, coming from the word ''sceaga'', meaning "wood". The name Crompton is also of Anglo-Saxon derivation, from the words ''crom''/''crumb'', meaning "crooked", and ''ton'', for "hamlet or village".<ref name="Changing Face"/> A local historian stated that "this name aptly describes the appearance of the place, with its uneven surface, its numerous mounds and hills, as though it had been crumpled up to form these ridges."<ref name="Shaw Church">{{cite book |last=Allen |first=Rev. G |date=1907 |title= Shaw Church in By-gone Days |publisher= Coultas & Volans, York}}</ref>

===Early history===
[[Image:Old-crompton-map-1851.jpg|right|thumb|A map of Shaw and Crompton from 1851. Although this map demonstrates how rural the area was at this time, there is evidence of cotton mills and heavy industry. Many features, such as place names and roads exist to this day.]]
The first evidence of human activity in the area comes from [[Iron Age]] artefacts discovered on [[Crompton Moor]] by local archaeologists. A [[Roman road]] was built through the area leading from the [[Castra|Roman fort]] ''[[Rigodunum]]'' in neighbouring [[Saddleworth]]. The path of the road still exists and crosses Buckstones Road on the way to Grains Bar.<ref>{{cite book | author=Crompton Library |title=Physical evidence of the road |publisher=Oldham Education & Leisure |date=N.D}}</ref>

In 1076, following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], the area was given to [[Roger the Poitevin|Roger de Pictaventis]], the maternal nephew to [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]].<ref name="Crompton Norman Tudors"/> The first recorded use of the name Crompton for the township was discovered in legal documents dating from the early 13th century, when Gilbert de Notton was granted the estate from descendants of the Norman conquerors.<ref name="Crompton Norman Tudors">{{cite web|url=http://web.onetel.com/~rgcrompton/origins/1200info1.html|author=Crompton, R|title=Crompton: From the Normans to the Tudors |date=[[2003-09-24]] |accessdate=2007-04-03 }}</ref> Some decades later, the de la Legh family&mdash;again of Norman descent&mdash;acquired the land.

Until the [[Industrial Revolution]], Crompton was a [[township (England)|township]] made up of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland, and swamp with a small community of families.<ref name="Look Crompton"/> The manufacture of [[wool]] in the area can be traced back as far as 1474, and to ensure that trade was kept buoyant, a law existed from 1675 to 1814 to encourage Shaw and Crompton's wool production. It required that everyone was to be buried in woollen garments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitoldham.co.uk/heritage/crompton.htm |title=Heritage; The Oldham Boroughs; Crompton |author=visitoldham.co.uk |accessdate=2006-06-22}}</ref> However, as technologies developed and demand increased, the manufacture of cotton in Crompton became more important than wool, and by 1792 the woollen industry had died out, replaced by cotton milling.<ref name="Shaw and Royton Area"/>

====Crompton family====
[[Crompton (surname)|Crompton]] first appears as a family name in the 13th century, when the principal landowner, Hugh de la Legh, decided to change his family name to "de Crompton" (of Crompton), the town which he and his family both owned and lived in. The Crompton family has a well-documented history and can be traced back to the time of [[Magna Carta]], appearing in the Assize Roll for 1245. The family was a prosperous landowner in the area and collectively had private ownership of most of Shaw and Crompton's land from its [[medieval]] acquisition, right through to the early 20th century. The family owned a large manor by the name of [[Crompton Hall]], on the site of [[Crompton Fold]] (more commonly known now as [[Buckstones]]). Crompton Hall first appears in historical records as early as 1442, owned by Thomas de Crompton and his family.<ref name="Crompton Norman Tudors"/>

The original "medieval" Crompton Hall was demolished around 1848.<ref name="Crompton Norman Tudors"/> A second Crompton Hall, set in its own prominent forested grounds, was erected by the family&mdash;by then an influential and affluent investor in the local cotton industry&mdash;but following the death of the last remaining family members, the site was sold and, in 1952, the manor was demolished to make way for an exclusive development of [[bungalow]]s.<ref name="Crompton Norman Tudors"/> Some of the original forested grounds of Crompton Hall remain in the Buckstones area today, as a small but popular wood. The legacy of the Cromptons is apparent in the area and [[Crompton House|Crompton House Church of England High School]] still bears the family name.

===Industrial Revolution and cotton===
Shaw and Crompton owes much of its history to the [[Industrial Revolution]], in particular to 19th century cotton spinning, which brought rapid expansion, prosperity, and economic growth. By 1913, Shaw and Crompton had one sixth of the [[Spindle (textiles)|spindles]] of the [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham Parliamentary Borough]] (nearby [[Oldham]], which lay within this borough, was the largest and most productive cotton spinning town in the world.<ref name="Cotton of Oldham"/>) In the post-[[World War I|war]] boom of 1919&ndash;20, investors did not have the time to build new mills and so were prepared to pay vastly inflated sums for shares in existing companies. Many mills were refloated at valuations of up to [[Pound sterling|GB<U+00A3>]]500,000, or five times what they had cost to build before the war,<ref name="Look Crompton"/> resulting in the town being nicknamed "The Golden City" as the scramble for shares intensified.<ref name="Look Crompton"/> Because of this highly profitable share dealing, it was reported in the national press that Shaw and Crompton had more millionaires per capita than any other town in the world.<ref name="Changing Face">{{cite book |last=Stott |first=Frances |date=1996 |title= The Changing Face of Crompton |publisher= Oldham Education & Leisure |isbn= 0-902809-38-5}}</ref><ref name="Shaw Advertiser">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldhamadvertiser.co.uk/neighbourhood/shaw/s/201/201057_shaw.html|title=Shaw|author= Anon |publisher=''[[Oldham Advertiser]]''|date=[[2005-06-05]]|accessdate =2007-06-21}}</ref><ref name="Shaw Spin Web">{{cite web |url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/a_display.php?irn=239&QueryPage=&lang= |title=Oldham Towns; Shaw|author=Spinning the Web|publisher= Manchester City Council|accessdate=2006-12-07}}</ref>

Shaw and Crompton's damp climate provided the ideal conditions for cotton spinning to be carried out without the cotton drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for mass production for the global market. Together with Oldham, at its peak the area was responsible for 13% of the world's cotton production.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitoldham.co.uk/heritage/history.htm |title=Heritage; The History of Oldham; Oldham History |author=visitoldham.co.uk |accessdate=2006-06-22}}</ref> 

The global demand for cotton goods led to a local expansion in both industry and population. In 1801, Shaw and Crompton had a population of 3,482, but by 1911 that had increased to 14,750. The number of cotton mills in the township peaked at 36 in 1920.<ref name="Shaw Spin Web"/> However, events following [[World War II]], and competition from abroad, led to a severe depression in the British cotton industry. Production declined and eventually came to a halt; the final cotton was spun in Shaw and Crompton in 1989, in Lilac and Park mills.<ref name="Oldham Borough Guide"/>

{{main|List of Shaw and Crompton Mills}}
No less than 48 separate [[Cotton mill|textile mills]] have graced the Shaw and Crompton skyline over the past three centuries. Today, only six of them still exist with, four of those having survived for over a century; the oldest is the Duke Mill, which has remained firm on its foundation stone since 1883. Below is a table outlining all the documented mills built in Shaw and Crompton since the mid-18th century.<ref name="Cotton of Oldham">{{cite book |author=Gurr & Hunt |date=1998 |title=The Cotton Mills of Oldham |publisher= Oldham Education & Leisure |isbn=0-902809-46-6}}</ref>

Shaw was originally a sub-district of Crompton,<ref>{{cite book |last= Hanyes |first=H |date=2004 |title=Rochdale Photographic Memories |publisher= Francis Frith Collection |isbn= 1-85937-846-3}}</ref> and appears to have its origins as the centre of Crompton because of the siting of a small chapel there dating back to around the 16th century.<ref name="Look Crompton">{{cite book |last=Hunt |first=Julian | coauthors = Frances Stott |date=1988 |title=Looking Back at Crompton |publisher=Oldham Education & Leisure |isbn= 0-902809-17-2}}</ref> In 1835, Shaw was noted as a chapelry within the township of Crompton.<ref name="Shaw GENUKI">{{cite web |url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/Shaw/|title=Shaw |publisher=GENUKI|accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> The [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]] describes Shaw as a populous village within the Crompton district.<ref name="1911 Encyclo"/> However due to the urbanisation of the Shaw area, and the establishment of a post office in Shaw itself,<ref name="Oldham Borough Guide">{{cite web |url=http://www.british-publishing.com/Pages/OldhamOG/districts.html |title=Oldham Borough Official Guide; The Borough's Districts |publisher=British-publishing.com |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> the two areas and names merged to form the present day "Shaw and Crompton". The area of Shaw and Crompton is often called Shaw by local communities (and increasingly in maps and literature); this is in contrast to former times when the area was broadly known as Crompton. This contrast can be seen on the markings of prominent historical structures, which only bear the name "Crompton".

Shaw and Crompton contains two separate [[Ward (politics)|political wards]], appropriately named "Shaw" and "Crompton" (to the east and west respectively),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geoplanning.oldham.gov.uk/gis/map.aspx?ACTION=PLANNING |title=Interactive Planning Map |publisher=Oldham.gov.uk |accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> and residential suburbs, including [[High Crompton]], [[Rushcroft]], [[Buckstones]], [[Clough, Shaw and Crompton|Clough]], [[Jubilee, Shaw and Crompton|Jubilee]], [[Shaw Side]], [[Wrens Nest]], [[Cowlishaw]], [[Low Crompton]], [[Nook, Shaw and Crompton|Nook]], [[Goats, Shaw and Crompton|Goats]], [[Wood End, Shaw and Crompton|Wood End]] and [[Shore Edge]].

==Economy==
[[Image:LittlewoodsNDC1.jpg|left|thumb|Shaw National Distribution Centre: A major employer of the local and wider communties.]]
Shaw and Crompton has become a base for distribution companies as a result of the town's good transport links, its supply of large, disused mill properties, and its situation between Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Lancashire, and West Yorkshire.<ref name="Oldham Borough Guide"/> It is home to the [[Littlewoods Shop Direct Group]]'s [[Shaw National Distribution Centre]], which is a major employer of the local and wider community. The company occupies three former cotton mills and state-of-the-art purpose-built storage and sorting facilities on a {{convert|20|acre|ha|1|sing=on}} complex within the town. In 2007, the site became the retail company's only packing and distribution centre for non-bulk items.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1771117,00.html|title=Littlewoods sheds 1,200 staff |author=Tran, Mark|publisher=Guardian Unlimited|date=[[2006-05-09]]|accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> It employs nearly 1,000 staff, making it  the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham's largest private employer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldhamadvertiser.co.uk/news/s/220/220185_littlewoods_pledges_400_new_jobs_.html |title=Littlewoods pledges 400 new jobs|author=Anon|publisher=''[[Oldham Advertiser]]''|date=[[2006-11-22]] |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> Children's toy distributors Toy Options and bakers [[Warburtons]] also have distribution centres in the town. 

Warburtons has had one of its 11 major bakeries in Shaw and Crompton since 1965. The "Pennine" bakery produces around 500,000 loaves a week and distributes them to major multiples and independent retailers throughout Greater Manchester, [[Cheshire]], and [[Derbyshire]]. Located on Glebe Street, it employs around 200 staff and produces a wide range of Warburtons bread products.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.warburtons.presscentre.com/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=110254&NewsAreaID=111 |title=Warburtons Bakeries; North West; Pennine |publisher=Warburtons Virtual Press Office |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref>
Until the 1990s, Shaw and Crompton was the home of [[Osram]], the multinational lightbulb manufacturer, which occupied Duke Mill and was a significant employer in the area. Production has since been moved away from the United Kingdom.

Trent Mill Industrial Estate, on the edge of the town near [[Rushcroft]], takes its name from the mill that was once found there. The [[business park]] is home to several small industrial companies. It was partially destroyed by a fire that started in a plastics factory in the early hours of [[April 28]], [[2007]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6602739.stm|title=Firefighters tackle factory blaze|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=[[2007-04-28]]|accessdate=2007-04-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk/NEWSM03.html|title=Inferno wrecks plastics factory|author=Hooton, Richard and Torr, Martyn|publisher=''[[Oldham Evening Chronicle]]''|date=[[2007-04-30]]|accessdate=2007-04-30}}</ref>

The original planning application was put to a public vote in 2005, and included proposals for 316 parking spaces, improved bus facilities, pedestrian routes linked to Market Street, junction improvements to nearby streets, and the relocation of a local tyre-fitting company.<ref>{{cite press release|title = ASDA Shaw - Your views count | publisher = Dialogue|date=February 2005}}</ref> The supermarket cost [[Pound sterling|GB<U+00A3>]]20million to construct, and is the first ASDA store in the United Kingdom to use [[environmentally friendly]] construction techniques, which [[Wal-Mart]] intends to use as a blueprint for all its new ASDA supermarkets.<ref name="ASDA"/> It incorporates a [[Sustainable forestry|sustainable timber]] frame and an [[Energy conservation|energy-saving]] ventilation system, which together have eradicated the need for 500&nbsp;tonnes of steel and 450&nbsp;tonnes of carbon emissions.<ref name="ASDA"/>

==Landmarks==
Despite its comparatively small size, Shaw and Crompton has several landmarks, including a large war memorial.

===Crompton War Memorials===
====First and Second World Wars====
[[Image:PMBWarMemorial.jpg|right|thumb|Crompton War Memorial.]]
The main Crompton War Memorial, located on the High Street, consists of a [[Granite|Scottish granite]] plinth surmounted by a large bronze statue flanked by two Rolls of Honour containing the 346 names of those from Shaw and Crompton who fought and died in [[World War I]]. Panels listing the Roll of Honour from [[World War II]] were added and unveiled on [[November 12]], [[1950]] by Councillor H. M. Turner.<ref name="Crompton War Memorial">{{cite web |url=http://pmsa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/MR/MR-OLD06.htm |title= Crompton War Memorial |author=[[Public Monuments and Sculpture Association]] |date=[[2003-06-16]] |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> Commissioned by the Crompton War Memorial Committee, the statue was conceptualised in 1919 by [[Richard Reginald Goulden]], and unveiled on [[April 29]], [[1923]] by [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|General Sir Ian Hamilton]]. The original cost for the memorial alone was GB<U+00A3>4,000, but the total cost, including site and layout, was about GB<U+00A3>6,067.<ref name="Crompton War Memorial"/>

The inscription on the memorial reads:

<center>''IN MEMORY OF THE MEN OF CROMPTON WHO FOUGHT AND GAVE THEIR LIVES TO FREE MANKIND FROM THE OPPRESSION AND BRUTAL TYRANNY OF WAR,. 1914<U+2013>1919.''</center>

The symbolic memorial depicts a group in which the central figure is a man defending the future generations, represented by young children, against foreign aggression, represented by a beast. The memorial is also a time capsule. Inside it is a lead casket containing coins, a copy of the local newspaper, three cops of spun cotton, and a length of cloth manufactured in the local area.<ref name="Changing Face"/>

====Second Boer War====
A second, smaller war memorial is located in Jubilee Gardens. It is dedicated to the soldiers who fought in the [[Second Boer War]]. It consists of a plaque built into a stone wall that is located between two large bushes.

Its inscription reads:
<center>''IN MEMORY OF THE CROMPTON MEN WHO LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR 1899<U+2013>1902''</center>

It then lists eight men: four who were "killed in action", two who "died of wounds", and two who "died of disease".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roll-of-honour.org/Lancashire/ShawBoer.html|title= Crompton South African War Memorial |publisher=Roll-of-Honour.org |accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref>

====The Beacon====
[[Image:Shaw & Crompton Beacon.JPG|left|thumb|150px|Shaw and Crompton Beacon]]
In 1995, to mark the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War, a landmark known as The Shaw and Crompton Beacon was erected in Jubilee Gardens. 

The inscription on the plaque below reads:
<center>''THE SHAW AND CROMPTON BEACON<br>ERECTED BY THE PARISH COUNCIL IN 1995 TO<br>COMMEMORATE THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF<br>THE ENDING OF WORLD WAR TWO<br><small>THIS PLAQUE WAS PRESENTED BY MEMBERS OF THE BRITISH LEGION</small></center>

===Crompton Moor===
[[Image:Pingot Quarry Waterfall.jpg|right|thumb|Pingot quarry at [[Crompton Moor]] features an un-named [[waterfall]].]]

===Big Lamp===
[[Image:BigLamp.jpg|left|thumb|The Big Lamp as seen in 2006. [[Crompton Moor]] can be seen in the background.]]
The Big Lamp was a six-sided gas-powered public street lamp standing {{convert|20|ft|m|0}} high at the original cross-road junction of Manchester Road, Oldham Road, High Street, and Church Road. It was pulled down on [[June 17]] [[1925]], when electric lighting was introduced.<ref name="Changing Face"/> Its absence was so evident that the adjacent public house, then known as The Kings Arms, was renamed The Big Lamp.<ref name="Shaw pubs">{{cite book|title=A History of Crompton and Shaw Pubs|last=Magee|first=Rob|publisher=Neil Richardson|date=1998|isbn=1-852160-30-6}}</ref>

During the 1990s, the junction was redeveloped to accommodate the new Crompton Way bypass. A large [[roundabout]] was built, and a scaled-down replica of the original Big Lamp was erected in its centre. The new Big Lamp is electrically powered and stands about {{convert|6|ft|m|0}} high. Once the new lamp appeared, the roundabout became known as the Big Lamp Roundabout, and the public house reverted to its original name.<ref name="Shaw pubs"/>

==Transport==
Shaw and Crompton has had a [[railway|rail transport]] line and station since 1863, when it was used mostly for haulage.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jeffrey|last=Wells|title=The Oldham Loop part one: Manchester Victoria to Shaw and Crompton|publisher=Foxline Publishing|date=2002|isbn=978-1-870119-68-9}}</ref> Today [[Shaw and Crompton railway station]] is used by passenger trains running between Rochdale and Manchester on the [[Manchester to Rochdale via Oldham Line|Oldham Loop railway line]]. 

After initially being rejected, plans to turn the line into part of the [[Manchester Metrolink]] were accepted by the government on [[July 6]], [[2006]]. Work is expected to start in 2008.<ref name="Metrolink01">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/5152948.stm |author=Anon |title=Metrolink extension is announced |publisher=BBC News |date=[[2006-07-06]] |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> The conversion will be likely to result in the decommissioning of the conventional [[heavy rail]] service on this line, with trams running along most of the existing line, which it is planned to re-route into Oldham town centre.

The bus company [[First Manchester]] provides frequent services to Oldham and Rochdale, with buses running on to the [[Trafford Centre]] and the suburbs of Rushcroft, Wrens Nest, and Buckstones. There is also a 'Shaw Circular' route, bus 403, which is run by Swan's Travel, which serves the smaller roads of Shaw and Crompton.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmpta.gov.uk/uploads/publications/71/090307.pdf|format=PDF  |title=Oldham local transport public forum |publisher=GMPTE |accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> [[Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive|GMPTE]] co-ordinates the bus routes in the area. Services which run in the Shaw and Crompton area are:
*58 Rochdale - Shaw - Oldham - Middleton - Trafford Centre (First Manchester)
*59 Rushcroft - Shaw - Oldham - Middleton - Manchester (First Manchester)
*181 Rochdale (First Manchester only) - Shaw - Royton - Chadderton - Manchester (Bluebird/First Manchester)

*408 Buckstones - Shaw - High Crompton - Royton - Oldham - Abeyhills - Stalybridge (First Manchester)
*435 Buckstones - Shaw - High Crompton - Turf Hill - Rochdale ([[Rossendale Transport]])

Shaw and Crompton is located south of Junction 21 of the [[M62 motorway]], which connects the town with other parts of Greater Manchester, as well as counties of England as far as [[Merseyside]] and [[South Yorkshire]].

==Education==
{{seealso|List of schools in the North West of England}}
Almost every suburb of Shaw and Crompton is served by a school of some kind, including some with religious affiliations. All the schools in the town perform either at or above the national average for test results. [[Crompton House]], a secondary school for 11- to 16-year-olds, also has a [[sixth form college]] of [[further education]] for 16- to 18-year-olds on the same site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crompton-house.oldham.sch.uk/|title=Crompton House School|author=|publisher=crompton-house.oldham.sch.uk|date=|accessdate=2007-07-26}}</ref>

===Future developments===
Shaw and Crompton town centre is the subject of controversy due to a successful application to convert a local venue into a [[Lap dance|lapdancing]] club, despite its close proximity to a primary school, nursery, and a youth club. Although the proposals caused concern, there were no formal complaints from local residents, the police, or the local council<U+2019>s child protection unit during the application period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldhamadvertiser.co.uk/news/s/216/216746_parishioners_join_the_fight_against_lap_dancing_club.html |title=Parishioners Join the Fight Against Lap Dancing Club |author=Appleton, Dave |publisher=''[[Oldham Advertiser]]'' |date=[[2006-10-23]] |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> However, what was described as a legally watertight argument from the applicant, as well as assurances about security arrangements, were enough to secure licensing for the venue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldhamadvertiser.co.uk/news/s/216/216212_lapdancing_a_shaw_thing.html |title=Lapdancing a Shaw Thing |author=Greer, Stuart |publisher=''[[Oldham Advertiser]]'' |date=[[2006-10-09]] |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref>
