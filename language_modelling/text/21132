'''Politics of Argentina''' takes place in a framework of a [[federation|federal]] [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Argentina]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a pluriform multi-party system. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the two chambers of parliament. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.
{{Politics of Argentina}}
==History==
Argentina is a representative [[democracy]]. This has not always been the case. Since the 1930s, the democratic rule of the country has been repeatedly brought down by [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat|coups d'<U+00E9>tat]]. After [[World War II]] and the destitution of [[Juan Per<U+00F3>n]], the recurring economic and institutional crises fostered the rise of illegal [[military regime]]s.

The Law 8.831 or [[Ley S<U+00E1>enz Pe<U+00F1>a]] of 1912 established universal, secret and obligatory male suffrage. This marked the moment when the middle classes entered government, displacing the landowning elite. Female suffrage was not introduced until 1947, under Per<U+00F3>n.

[[Jorge Rafael Videla]]'s [[dictatorship]], started in 1976, began its fall in 1982 after the defeat in the [[Falklands war|Falklands/Malvinas war]], and ended in 1983 with the democratic election of [[president of Argentina|president]] [[Ra<U+00FA>l Alfons<U+00ED>n]]. Alfons<U+00ED>n faced important challenges, including a military [[rebellion|uprising]], and resigned in 1989, six months before the end of his term, but the country was not in clear danger of becoming subject to a dictatorship again. [[Carlos Menem]] was the president for six more years and made [[Olivos Pact|a pact]] with Alfons<U+00ED>n in order to achieve [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution|a constitutional reform]] that would allow him to be reelected. Following a [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] program, he ruled for four more years, until 1999, and then [[Fernando de la R<U+00FA>a]] was elected. This was the first time in decades that an Argentine president properly finished his term and passed on his charge to another democratically elected president.

De la R<U+00FA>a, however, could not manage the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|economic crisis]] and finally resigned on [[December 21]], [[2001]], amid [[December 2001 riots (Argentina)|violent riots]]. Several short-lived [[ad interim|interim]] presidents came and went, until Congress finally chose [[Eduardo Duhalde]] to rule until some sort of social and economic peace could be restored. Duhalde took care of the most critical matters and called for democratic elections, where [[N<U+00E9>stor Kirchner]] was chosen (for the first time employing the [[ballotage]] system). Kirchner took office on [[25 May]] [[2003]] and is the current [[president of Argentina]], to serve until 2007.

===Political parties===
[[Image:Buenos Aires-2687f-Monumento a Roca.jpg|thumb|250px|Julio A. Roca monument in Buenos Aires, Argentina]]
Argentina's two largest political parties are the [[Justicialist Party]] (''Partido Justicialista,'' or PJ), which evolved out of [[Juan Per<U+00F3>n]]'s efforts in the 1940s to expand the role of labor in the political process (see [[Peronism]]), and the [[Radical Civic Union]] (''Uni<U+00F3>n C<U+00ED>vica Radical,'' or UCR), founded in 1890. Traditionally, the UCR had more urban middle-class support and the PJ more labor support, but both parties are now broadly based.

A grouping of mostly left-leaning parties and former Peronists &mdash; the [[Front for a Country in Solidarity]] (''Frente por un Pa<U+00ED>s Solidario,'' or FrePaSo) &mdash; emerged in the 1990s as a serious political contender to the PJ, especially in the federal capital. In August 1997, the UCR and FrePaSo formed a coalition called the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education (informally ''la Alianza'' "the Alliance"). The Alliance succeeded in taking Fernando de la R<U+00FA>a (UCR) to the presidency, with Carlos <U+00C1>lvarez (FrePaSo) as vice-president; but <U+00C1>lvarez resigned in 2000 after a scandal related to bribes in the Senate (the President's party refused to support or investigate the denunciations), and the Alliance was in practice broken from that moment on.

After this episode, followed by the resignation of [[Fernando de la R<U+00FA>a]] (who had to the flee from the government house in a helicopter), on [[December 21]], [[2001]], the UCR's reputation was severely damaged, and the party lost many of its supporters. To some people, de la R<U+00FA>a's flight, coupled with the resignation of Ra<U+00FA>l Alfons<U+00ED>n in 1989, confirmed the idea that the Radical party was not fit to rule, though it must be noted that in both cases Peronist activists are believed to have fueled popular discontent and even incited revolts to bring about this result.

Smaller parties occupy various positions on the political spectrum and some are active only in certain provinces. In the years after Per<U+00F3>n's first years in office, several provincial parties emerged, often as a vehicle for the continued activities of Peronists, whose party was now banned, or as coalitions of politicians from all sectors wishing to take forward provincial interests. Provincial parties grew in popularity and number after the return of democracy in 1983, and took several of the provincial governor positions. Both these parties and the provincial branches of the UCR and PJ have frequently been dominated by modern ''[[caudillo]]s'' and family dynasties, such as the Sapags of [[Neuqu<U+00E9>n Province|Neuqu<U+00E9>n]] and the Rodr<U+00ED>guez Sa<U+00E1>'s of [[San Luis Province|San Luis]]. This has in turn been a factor in the ongoing factionalism within the two principal parties at national and local levels.

Historically, organized labor (largely tied to the Peronist Party) and the armed forces also have played significant roles in national life. Labor's political power was significantly weakened by free market reforms during the 1990s, as well as the cooptation of labor leaders by the Menem administration. They now seem to be returning to their former position, since the current government focuses on a productive model with local industry as one of the top priorities.

The armed forces are firmly under [[civilian control of the military|civilian control]]. Repudiated by the public after a period of military rule marked by [[human rights]] violations, economic decline, and military defeat, the Argentine military today is a downsized, volunteer force focused largely on international peacekeeping. While Menem and de la R<U+00FA>a simply reduced their funding, Kirchner has effected an "ideological cleansing", removing a large portion of the top ranks and replacing them with younger leaders with an explicit commitment to preserve human rights and submit to the decisions of the civilian government.

In recent times two newer parties have gained weight in the political scene. One of them, ARI, was formed on the initiative of [[Elisa Carri<U+00F3>]], formerly a member of the UCR, and presented itself as a non-compromising front against corruption and for progressive ideas. ARI took the place of the defunct Alliance in the ideological spectrum.

Carri<U+00F3> came close fourth in [[Elections in Argentina, 2003|the last presidential election]], after a very austere campaign. She is known as a devout, somewhat mystically oriented Catholic, and frequently criticizes what she sees as pettiness and short-term vision on the part of the current administration, employing an assortment of quotations from social philosophers and even the Bible; however, her influence has diminished lately, as the Kirchner administration harvests a measure of success and centre-left policies, and she becomes more extravagant. In the [[Elections in Argentina, 2005|2005 parliamentary elections]], her party list (led by herself) came second after [[Mauricio Macri]]'s [[Commitment to Change]] party for the Legislature of Buenos Aires.

The other party, called Recrear, is also led by a former Radical party member, [[Ricardo L<U+00F3>pez Murphy]], who was briefly a minister of Economy of Fernando de la R<U+00FA>a. Recrear captured the moderate right-wing spectrum of voters, especially urban voters of the middle and upper classes. L<U+00F3>pez Murphy came third in the last presidential elections, with a platform that emphasized a fight against corruption and for transparency, attempting to appeal to voters who were content with the neo-liberal outlook of the 1990s but would not give their vote to a candidate they viewed as corrupt (Carlos Menem). L<U+00F3>pez Murphy continued to criticize populism and state assistance. He was a candidate for the Senate in the province of Buenos Aires in the 2005 elections, with meagre results. Subsequently Recrear has joined forces with a group of provincial parties and Macri's Commitment to Change to form PRO - ''[[Republican Proposal|Propuesta Republicana]]'', a new centre-right coalition ahead of the [[Elections in Argentina, 2007|2007 elections]].

==Policy==
Each administration had different priorities. President [[Raul Alfons<U+00ED>n|Alfons<U+00ED>n]] took office on the giving up of power by the last [[military junta]], and his main task was to ensure a peaceful transition. In the end he was overcome by an economic crisis that led to a bout of [[hyperinflation]].

President [[Carlos Menem|Menem]] first had to control inflation and stabilize the economy, which he did by adopting a series of radical measures including [[fixed exchange rate|fixed parity]] between the [[Argentine peso]] and the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]].

He then engaged in a program to move Argentina's economy towards a [[Liberal theory of economics|liberal model]]. This plan included the [[privatization]] of the previously state-owned telecommunications company, oil conglomerate ([[Yacimientos Petrol<U+00ED>feros Fiscales|YPF]], airline ([[Aerol<U+00ED>neas Argentinas]]), railroads and utilities. As a result, large foreign direct investment flowed into Argentina, improving in some cases the infrastructure and quality of service of said companies.

In the social arena, during his tenure in government, Menem ended compulsory military [[conscription]], and [[pardon]]ed military officers and insurgents serving sentences for [[human rights]] abuses of the [[Dirty War]].

Menem's administration was also regarded by many as corrupt and frivolous. Many members of his administrations have been indicted for profiteering while in office. However, despite many investigations, his opponents have never found legal evidence that Menem had personally profited illegally from his administration. The executive had a visible influence on the decisions of the judiciary, especially the [[Argentine Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], and displayed a certain contempt for political minorities. Moreover, it did nothing to reduce political corruption and inefficiency, one of the most important and oldest problems in the Argentine government (Argentina's [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] for 1999 was 3 out of 10, ranking 71st in a survey of 99 countries). [http://www.icgg.org/corruption.cpi_olderindices_1999.html]

[[Fernando de la R<U+00FA>a]]'s term was notoriously ineffective on many accounts. Elected with a popular mandate to reinvigorate the economy and crack down on the corruption of the Menem administration, de la R<U+00FA>a was unable or unwilling to perform these tasks. He continued on the same economic course of Menem, which ultimately led to the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|2001 economic crash]] and de la R<U+00FA>a's resignation. The [[FrePaSo]] ministers of the administration, elected on a wave of hope for social changes, also disappointed with a perceived lack of investment in social schemes.

[[Eduardo Duhalde]]'s interim term was marked by the need to pacify the country and soften the impact of the crisis on the citizens after the forced [[devaluation]] of the local currency, which lost three quarters of its value in a matter of months. Duhalde employed a mixture of traditional [[Peronism|Peronist]] [[populism]] (in the form of a monetary subsidy for heads of families) and neo-[[Keynes]]ian economic principles to stabilize the economy and bring peace to the streets.

[[N<U+00E9>stor Kirchner]], who belongs to the moderate center-left wing of Peronism (rooted in the leftist Peronist factions of the 1970s), continued Duhalde's measures (even keeping his Minister of Economy, [[Roberto Lavagna]]) and added some heterodox economics. Heavy taxes on exports have served to keep local prices of valuable commodities on check, while collecting huge revenues (especially from [[Petroleum|oil]] products and agricultural exports like [[soybean]]). The restrictive monetary policy of the 1990s has become aggressively expansive; the [[Banco Central de la Rep<U+00FA>blica Argentina|Central Bank]] has injected large amounts of cash into the economy and bought dollars from the free currency market in order to accumulate reserves. The fiscal policy is also expansive; the government has raised private and public salaries by decree on several occasions, and has encouraged negotiations between the private sector and the labor movements. Inflation has again become a concern. The government has struck price-freezing agreements with certain sectors of the economy (producers of milk, some foods, natural gas, etc.) and put heavy pressure on others. Failure to comply on the part of [[Argentine beef]] producers has been met with [[2006 Argentine restriction of beef exports|a punitive suspension of exports]], starting March 2006, intended to increase domestic supply (this was then softened to a [[quota]] system).

==Current government==
The current chief of state and head of government is [[President of Argentina|President]] [[N<U+00E9>stor Kirchner]]. The Vice-President, [[Daniel Scioli]], belongs to the Legislative Branch, since he is also the president of the Senate. The cabinet, appointed by the President, underwent major changes on [[2005-11-28]], after the [[Elections in Argentina, 2005|elections]], and is currently composed of a Chief of Cabinet and 10 Ministers.

The Legislative Branch is a bicameral [[Argentine National Congress|Congress]], which consists of the [[Argentine Senate|Senate]] (72 seats), presided by the Vice-President, and the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] (257 seats), currently presided by [[Alberto Balestrini]] of the Province of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]]). The General Auditing Office of the Nation and the Ombudsman are also part of this branch.

The Judiciary Branch is composed of federal judges and others with different jurisdictions, and a [[Supreme Court of Argentina|Supreme Court]] with nine members, appointed by the President with approval of the Senate, who may be deposed by Congress. Two posts are currently vacant.
