===Feedback===
{{main|Effects of global warming}}
When a warming trend results in effects that induce further warming, the process is referred to as a positive feedback; when the effects induce cooling, the process is referred to as a negative feedback. The primary positive feedback involves water vapor. The primary negative feedback is the effect of temperature on emission of infrared radiation: as the temperature of a body increases, the emitted radiation increases with the fourth power of its [[absolute temperature]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/564843/Stefan-Boltzmann-law "Stefan-Boltzmann Law", Britannica Online]</ref> This provides a powerful negative feedback which stabilizes the climate system over time.

One of the most pronounced positive feedback effects relates to the evaporation of water. If the atmosphere is warmed, the [[saturation vapour pressure]] increases, and the quantity of water vapor in the atmosphere will tend to increase. Since water vapor is a greenhouse gas, the increase in water vapor content makes the atmosphere warm further; this warming causes the atmosphere to hold still more water vapor (a [[positive feedback]]), and so on until other processes stop the feedback loop. The result is a much larger greenhouse effect than that due to CO<sub>2</sub> alone. Although this feedback process causes an increase in the absolute moisture content of the air, the [[relative humidity]] stays nearly constant or even decreases slightly because the air is warmer.<ref name="soden1">{{cite journal| first=Brian J. | last=Soden | coauthors=Held, Isacc M. | journal=[[Journal of Climate]] | title=An Assessment of Climate Feedbacks in Coupled Ocean<U+2013>Atmosphere Models | date=[[2005-11-01]] | volume=19 | issue=14 | url=http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/reference/bibliography/2006/bjs0601.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2007-04-21 | quote=Interestingly, the true feedback is consistently weaker than the constant relative humidity value, implying a small but robust reduction in relative humidity in all models on average" "clouds appear to provide a positive feedback in all models | pages=3354<U+2013>3360 | doi=10.1175/JCLI3799.1}}</ref>

Feedback effects due to clouds are an area of ongoing research. Seen from below, clouds emit infrared radiation back to the surface, and so exert a warming effect; seen from above, clouds reflect sunlight and emit infrared radiation to space, and so exert a cooling effect. Whether the net effect is warming or cooling depends on details such as the [[list of cloud types|type]] and altitude of the cloud, details that have been difficult to represent in climate models.<ref name="soden1" />

A subtler feedback process relates to changes in the [[lapse rate]] as the atmosphere warms. The atmosphere's temperature decreases with height in the [[troposphere]]. Since emission of infrared radiation varies with the fourth power of temperature, [[longwave radiation]] emitted from the upper atmosphere is less than that emitted from the lower atmosphere. Most of the radiation emitted from the upper atmosphere escapes to space, while most of the radiation emitted from the lower atmosphere is re-absorbed by the surface or the atmosphere. Thus, the strength of the greenhouse effect depends on the atmosphere's rate of temperature decrease with height: if the rate of temperature decrease is greater the greenhouse effect will be stronger, and if the rate of temperature decrease is smaller then the greenhouse effect will be weaker. Both theory and climate models indicate that with increased greenhouse gas content the rate of temperature decrease with height will be reduced, producing a negative ''lapse rate feedback'' that weakens the greenhouse effect. Measurements of the rate of temperature change with height are very sensitive to small errors in observations, making it difficult to establish whether the models agree with observations.<ref>[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10850 Panel on Climate Change Feedbacks, Climate Research Committee, National Research Council, 2004: Understanding Climate Change Feedbacks.]</ref>

As the ice melts, land or open water takes its place. Both land and open water are on average less reflective than ice, and thus absorb more solar radiation. This causes more warming, which in turn causes more melting, and this cycle continues. Rapid [[Arctic shrinkage]] is already occurring, with 2007 being the lowest ever recorded [[sea ice]] area.

Warming is also the triggering variable for the release of methane from sources both on land and on the deep ocean floor, making both of these possible feedback effects. Thawing [[permafrost]], such as the frozen [[peat]] [[bog]]s in [[Siberia]], creates a [[positive feedback]] due to release of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>.<ref>{{cite news | first=Ian | last=Sample | title=Warming Hits 'Tipping Point' | date=[[2005-08-11]] | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,1546824,00.html | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | accessdate=2007-01-18}}</ref> Methane discharge from permafrost is presently under intensive study.

A rapid buildup of greenhouse gases amplified warming in the early [[Jurassic]] period (about 180 million years ago), with average temperatures rising by 5&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (9&nbsp;<U+00B0>F). Research by the [[Open University]] indicates that the warming caused the rate of rock [[weathering]] to increase by 400%. As such weathering locks away carbon in [[calcite]] and [[dolomite]], CO<sub>2</sub> levels dropped back to normal over roughly the next 150,000 years.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Cohen | first=Anthony S. | coauthors=''et al.'' | year=2004 | month=February | title=Osmium isotope evidence for the regulation of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> by continental weathering | journal=[[Geology (journal)|Geology]] | volume=32 | issue=2 | pages=157<U+2013>160 | doi=10.1130/G20158.1 | url=http://sheba.geo.vu.nl/~vonh/imagesanddata/data/Cohenetal2004.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2007-03-04}}</ref>

Sudden releases of methane from [[clathrate compound]]s (the [[clathrate gun hypothesis]]) have been hypothesized as both a cause for and an effect of other warming events in the distant past, including the [[Permian<U+2013>Triassic extinction event]] (about 251 million years ago) and the [[Paleocene<U+2013>Eocene Thermal Maximum]] (about 55 million years ago).

Scientists have studied global warming with [[computer models]] of the climate.

Models are also used to help investigate the [[Attribution of recent climate change|causes of recent climate change]] by comparing the observed changes to those that the models project from various natural and human-derived causes.

Although it is difficult to connect specific weather events to global warming, an increase in global temperatures may in turn cause broader [[effects of global warming|changes]], including [[Glacier mass balance|glacial retreat]], [[Arctic shrinkage]], and worldwide [[sea level rise]]. Changes in the amount and pattern of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] may result in [[flood]]ing and [[drought]]. There may also be changes in the frequency and intensity of [[extreme weather]] events. These changes are not likely to be reversible on timescales shorter than a thousand years.<ref name='Solomon2009'>{{cite doi | 10.1073/pnas.0812721106}}</ref> Other effects may include changes in agricultural yields, addition of new trade routes,<ref>{{cite news |first=Jennifer |last=Macey |title=Global warming opens up Northwest Passage |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/19/2037198.htm?section=business |publisher=ABC News |date=September 19, 2007 |accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref> reduced summer [[streamflow]]s, species [[extinction risk from climate change|extinctions]],<ref name="ar4syn">{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf |format=PDF | title=Climate Change 2007: Synthesis report | work=Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report | accessdate=2009-02-03 | date=2007-02-05 | publisher=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]}}</ref> and increases in the range of [[Vector (biology)|disease vectors]].

Some effects on both the [[natural environment]] and [[civilization|human life]] are, at least in part, already being attributed to global warming.

The black line in middle of the shaded area indicates 'best estimates'; the red and the blue lines the likely limits. From the work of [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|IPCC AR4]].]] Some economists have tried to estimate the aggregate net economic costs of damages from climate change across the globe. Such estimates have so far yielded no conclusive findings; in a survey of 100 estimates, the values ran from [[United States dollar|US$]]-10 per tonne of carbon (tC) (US$-3 per tonne of carbon dioxide) up to [[US$]]350/tC (US$95 per tonne of carbon dioxide), with a mean of US$43 per tonne of carbon (US$12 per tonne of carbon dioxide).<ref name="WGII SPM AR4" />

One widely publicized report on potential economic impact is the [[Stern Review]].

According to [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), economic sectors likely to face difficulties related to climate change include [[bank]]s, [[Climate change and agriculture|agriculture]], transport and others.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.unepfi.org/fileadmin/documents/CEO_briefing_climate_change_2002_en.pdf | format=PDF | title=Climate Risk to Global Economy |last=Dlugolecki |first=Andrew |coauthors=''et al.'' |work=CEO Briefing: UNEP FI Climate Change Working Group | publisher=[[United Nations Environment Programme]] |accessdate=2007-04-29 |year=2002}}</ref> Developing countries dependent upon agriculture will be particularly harmed by global warming.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rff.org/Publications/Resources/Documents/164/RFF-Resources-164_Thomas%20Schelling.pdf | title=Thomas Schelling: Developing Countries Will Suffer Most from Global Warming| accessdate=2008-03-01 | work=Resources 164 |format=PDF}} </ref>

==Adaptation and mitigation==
{{main|Adaptation to global warming|Mitigation of global warming|Kyoto Protocol|Geoengineering}}
The [[Scientific opinion on climate change|broad agreement]] among climate scientists that global temperatures will continue to increase has led some [[nation]]s, [[state]]s, [[corporation]]s and individuals to implement responses. These responses to global warming divide broadly between [[Adaptation to global warming|adapting]] to the [[effects of global warming]] and reducing or even reversing global warming itself. The latter is referred to as [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] and includes emission reduction, [[carbon sequestration]], and certain [[geoengineering]] techniques which seek to directly remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.

The slow pace of action to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions have led some scientists, such as [[Ken Caldeira]] and the [[Nobel Prize]] winning [[Paul Crutzen]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=geoengineering-how-to-cool-earth |title=Geoengineering: How to Cool Earth--At a Price |accessdate=27 January 2009 |publisher=Scientific American |date=October 2008 |author=Robert Kunzig}}</ref> to suggest [[geoengineering]] techniques. [[Geoengineering]] can be divided into mitigation techniques which remove greenhouse gases (e.g. [[carbon dioxide air capture]]), and adaptation techniques (e.g. the creation of [[stratospheric sulfur aerosols]]).

===Mitigation===

Many environmental groups encourage [[Individual and political action on climate change|individual action]] against global warming, often by the consumer, but also by community and regional organizations. Others have suggested a [[quota]] on worldwide fossil fuel production, citing a direct link between fossil fuel production and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.<ref>{{cite web| title=Climate Control: a proposal for controlling global greenhouse gas emissions | publisher=Sustento Institute | url=http://sustento.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/climate-control.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Rigged - The climate talks are a stitch-up, as no one is talking about supply. | first=George | last=Monbiot | url=http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2007/12/11/rigged/ | format=HTML | accessdate=2007-12-22}}</ref>

There has also been [[business action on climate change]], including efforts at increased energy efficiency and limited moves towards use of [[alternative fuels]]. In January 2005 the European Union introduced its [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]], a greenhouse gas [[emissions trading]] scheme through which companies, in conjunction with government, agree to cap their emissions or to purchase credits from those below their allowances. Australia announced its [[Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme]] in 2008. United States President [[Barack Obama]] has announced he will introduce an economy wide [[cap and trade]] scheme.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/newenergy | title=Barack Obama and Joe Biden: New Energy for America | accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref>

The world's primary international agreement on combating global warming is the [[Kyoto Protocol]], an amendment to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UNFCCC]] negotiated in 1997. The Protocol now covers more than 160 countries globally and over 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/kyoto_protocol/application/pdf/kpstats.pdf | format=PDF |title=Kyoto Protocol Status of Ratification | publisher=[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] | date=[[2006-07-10]] | accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> Only the [[United States]] and [[Kazakhstan]] have not ratified the treaty, with the United States historically being the world's [[greenhouse gas emissions by the United States|largest emitter]] of greenhouse gas.

The IPCC's Working Group III is responsible for crafting reports that deal with the mitigation of global warming and analyzing the costs and benefits of different approaches. In the 2007 [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]], they conclude that no one technology or sector can be completely responsible for mitigating future warming. They find there are key practices and technologies in various sectors, such as [[energy supply]], [[transport]]ation, [[industry]], and [[agriculture]], that should be implemented to reduced global emissions. They estimate that stabilization of [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] between 445 and 710 ppm by 2030 will result in between a 0.6 percent increase and three percent decrease in global [[gross domestic product]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://arch.rivm.nl/env/int/ipcc/pages_media/FAR4docs/final_PDFs_ar4/SPM.pdf | format=PDF | title=Summary for Policymakers | work=Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.

The issue of climate change has sparked debate weighing the benefits of limiting [[industrial process|industrial]] [[Air pollution|emissions]] of [[greenhouse gas]]es against the [[Economics of global warming|costs]] that such changes would entail.

A variety of issues are often raised in relation to global warming. One is [[ocean acidification]]. Increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increases the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in the oceans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.hq.nasa.gov/oceans/system/carbon.html |title=The Ocean and the Carbon Cycle |accessdate=2007-03-04 |date=[[2005-06-21]] |work=[[NASA]]}}</ref> CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in the ocean reacts with water to form [[carbonic acid]], resulting in acidification.

[[Global dimming]], the gradual reduction in the amount of global direct [[irradiance]] at the Earth's surface, may have partially mitigated global warming in the late 20th century. From 1960 to 1990 human-caused aerosols likely precipitated this effect. Scientists have stated with 66<U+2013>90% confidence that the effects of human-caused aerosols, along with volcanic activity, have offset some of the global warming, and that greenhouse gases would have resulted in more warming than observed if not for these dimming agents.<ref name="grida7" />

[[Ozone depletion]], the steady decline in the total amount of [[ozone]] in Earth's [[stratosphere]], is frequently cited in relation to global warming. Although there are [[Ozone depletion#Ozone depletion and global warming|areas of linkage]], the relationship between the two is not strong.
