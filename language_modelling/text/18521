She has been a Minister in four governments, and has authored a number of books in the areas of [[etymology]], [[law]] and [[animal welfare]]. Maneka Gandhi is an estranged member of the [[Nehru-Gandhi Family]].

==Early life==
Gandhi was born in [[Delhi]] and educated at [[Lawrence School, Sanawar]], and later at [[Lady Shriram College]] in [[New Delhi]]. She married [[Sanjay Gandhi]], the son of the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. A former model <ref name="model">[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050806/asp/weekend/story_5061896.asp Maneka had posed as a model for a few ads for DCM Towelling]. She, however, denies that she was a professional model.</ref> and editor of Surya India magazine, Gandhi entered politics in [[1982]] after her husband's death in a plane crash. She had a public falling out with [[Indira Gandhi]], "after [Maneka] signalled her intention to step into her late husband's shoes in the Congress" <ref>[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060423/asp/nation/story_6133996.asp Article in The Telegraph]</ref>

==Political career==
Gandhi was the petitioner in the case of [[Maneka Gandhi v Union of India]],<ref name="Maneka-Indian_Union">[http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/qrydisp.asp?tfnm=5154 Text of the Supreme Court judgment]</ref> a 1979 case involving [[Fundamental Rights in India#Right to freedom|freedom of movement]]. "The case involved the refusal by the government to grant a passport to [Gandhi], which thus restrained her liberty to travel."<ref name="Justiciability">[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/edumat/IHRIP/circle/justiciability.htm Justiciability of ESC Rights<U+2014>the Indian Experience]</ref> In its ruling in the case, the [[Supreme Court of India]] in a departure from its earlier stand taken in its ruling in [[A.K.Gopalan v. State of Madras]] (1950), expanded the scope and content of the right to life and liberty by introducing the concept of [[substantive due process]] to Indian law.<ref name="Justiciability"/> In writing that decision, the court found that "Democracy is based essentially on free debate and open discussion, for that is the only corrective of government action in a democratice [sic] setup."<ref> [http://www.sabrang.com/news/2004/03mar04.htm Sabrang Alternate News Network article]</ref><ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/~andrew/CommonLII/INSC/1978/17.html Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India], page 696.</ref>

Gandhi formed the [[Sanjay Vichar Manch]] ("Platform for Sanjay's Thought") in [[1983]] and joined the [[Janata Dal]] in [[1988]]. She was the general secretary of JD [[1988]]-[[1989]]. She won her first election in 1989 and served as Minister of the Environment from [[1989]] to [[1991]] in the cabinet of [[V.P. Singh]]. In [[1996]] and [[1998]], she was reelected to the [[Lok Sabha]] as an independent member from [[Pilibhit]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]] and served in the [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] led governments as Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment, and Minister for Culture. She created the Department for Animal Welfare and served as its Minister along with her other portfolios. While she was Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment, she played a historic role in the [[Indian pension reforms]] effort, through the early phase of `[[Project OASIS]]'. OASIS is an acronym for Old Age Social and Income Security. Maneka Gandhi played a key role in the initiation and early thinking on these issues, going upto the point where it was transferred to the Ministry of Finance (where [[Yashwant Sinha]] was minister) for implementation. This went on to become the celebrated [[New Pension System]] (NPS) which was implemented for new recruits into the central government from 2004 onwards.

She stood for the [[Indian general election, 2004|2004 Lok Sabha elections]] on the BJP ticket and is currently a Member of Parliament from Pilibhit. She has won every time she has contested from Pilibhit except once, even though she has changed parties often and contested on different tickets. This is considered to be an indicator of her personal popularity in the region, which has been attributed to her nurturing the constituency and her Punjabi origins.<ref> [http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/may082004/iv2.asp Deccan Herald article on her electoral record in Philibit]</ref><ref>[http://www.media-watch.org/articles/0999/394.html The Times of India article crediting her electoral victories herself as opposed to her family name]</ref> Her son [[Varun Gandhi]].

==Environmental activism==
Gandhi is an environmentalist who brought to the mainstream the issue of [[animal rights]] in India. She was appointed chairwoman of the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA) in 1995. Under her direction, unannounced inspections of laboratories where animals are used for scientific research were conducted, and abominable conditions and cruelty were documented and exposed. The CPCSEA imposed restrictions that brought some of the abuse to a stop. She started the organisation [[People for Animals]] in 1992 and it is the largest organisation for animal rights/welfare in India. She is a vegetarian  or rather a vegan and has advocated this lifestyle on ethical and health grounds. She also anchored a weekly Television program named ''"Heads and Tails"'' highlighting sufferings meted out to animals due to their commercial exploitation. She has also authored a book under the same title. Her other books were about Indian people names. She runs an NGO, People For Animals, which has its shelters across India. <ref>[http://www.amazon.ca/gp/search/701-8966233-9494705?search-alias=stripbooks&field-author=Gandhi%2C%20Maneka List of books authored by Maneka, from Amazon]</ref>

Her animal rights activism has done wonders for everyone and especially brought awareness about the conditions that animals  are treated.The way they are treated right from the day when they are born, to their night marish ride to the abattoir and how they are slaughtered in front of one another.

==Career in journalism==
As a journalist, Maneka Gandhi is popular for her shocking publication in Surya Magazine of photos showing [[sexual intercourse]] between [[Suresh Ram]] (son of the then Defence Minister [[Babu Jagjivan Ram]]) and Sushma Chaudhury, a [[University of Delhi]] student.<ref>[http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/proj_tabloid/tabloidhome1912.shtml Maneka centrespreads sex romp]</ref> Her daring publication of the photos ran the risk of violation of obscenity laws. The revealing pictures<ref>[http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/proj_tabloid/pg/big01.htm Sexually explicit photos] showing Suresh Ram and Sushma Chaudhary in compromising positions.</ref> were published apparently to discredit Jagjivan Ram, who defected from the [[Indira Gandhi]] government and helped bring [[Janata Party]] to power in 1977. He was one of the contenders for the post of [[Prime Minister of India]].<ref>[http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/proj_tabloid/politics.shtml A tale of sex and politics!] </ref>
