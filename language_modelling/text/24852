The '''Lutheran Church in America''' (LCA) was a U.S. [[Lutheran]] church body that existed from 1962 to 1987. It was headquartered in New York City and its publishing house was [[Fortress Press]].

The LCA's immigrant heritage came mostly from Germany, [[Sweden]], [[Slovakia]], Denmark and [[Finland]], and its demographic focus was on the East Coast (centered on [[Pennsylvania]]), with large numbers in the Midwest and some presence in the [[South Atlantic States|Southern Atlantic]] states.

Theologically, the LCA was often considered the most [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]] and [[Ecumenicism|ecumenical]] branch in American Lutheranism, although there were tendencies toward conservative pietism in some rural and small-town congregations. In church governance, the LCA was clerical and centralized, in contrast to the [[Congregational church|congregationalist]] or "low church" strain in American Protestant Christianity. With some notable exceptions, LCA churches tended to be more formalistically liturgical than their counterparts in the [[American Lutheran Church]]. Among the Lutheran churches in America, the LCA was thus the one that was most similar to the established Lutheran churches in Europe.

The LCA [[ordination|ordained]] the country's first female Lutheran [[pastor]], the Rev. [[Elizabeth Platz]], in November 1970. It subsequently ordained the nation's first female [[African American]] Lutheran pastor (1979), first [[Latino|Latina]] Lutheran pastor (1979), and first female [[Asian American]] Lutheran pastor (1982).

==Formation==

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, many of the independent U.S. Lutheran church bodies moved progressively toward greater unity. In 1960, for example, a number of such bodies joined to form the [[American Lutheran Church]].

The Lutheran Church in America was another product of these trends, forming in 1962 out of a merger among the following independent Lutheran denominations:
* The [[United Lutheran Church in America]] (ULCA), established in 1918 with the merger of three independent German-American synods: the [[General Synod (Lutheran)|General Synod]], the [[General Council (Lutheran)|General Council]] and the [[United Synod of the South]]. This group provided the bulk of the eventual LCA's membership.
* The [[Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America]] (Suomi Synod), established in 1890.
* The [[American Evangelical Lutheran Church]], traditionally a Danish-American Lutheran denomination, established in 1872.
* The [[Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church]], traditionally a Swedish-American Lutheran denomination, established in 1860.

The merger was largely engineered through the efforts of [[Franklin Clark Fry]], who had served as president of the [[United Lutheran Church in America]] since 1944 and president of the [[Lutheran World Federation]] since 1957. Fry was known by contemporaries as "Mr. Protestant," a moniker that captured his tireless work on behalf of greater ecumenical unity among Protestant church bodies.

The merger was made official and celebrated at a convention in [[Detroit| Detroit, Michigan]] on June 28, 1962. <ref>* {{cite book |last=Gilbert |first=W. Kent |title=Commitment to Unity: A History of the Lutheran Church in America |pages=p. 111}} </ref> Upon its inception, the LCA became the largest Lutheran church body in the United States.

==Merger into the ELCA==

On [[January 1]], [[1988]], the Lutheran Church in America ceased to exist when it, along with the [[American Lutheran Church]] and the [[Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches]], joined together to form the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA), today the largest Lutheran church body in the United States. At the time of the merger, the LCA remained the largest Lutheran church body in the United States, and it brought approximately 2.85 million members into the ELCA.
