==Synopsis==
[[Image:Puss in Boots - Project Gutenberg etext 19993.jpg|thumb|Puss in Boots consoles her master, illustrated in a 1927 story anthology]]
The division of property after a [[miller]]'s death leaves his [[youngest son]] with nothing but the [[granary]] [[cat]]. Disappointed, the son contemplates eating the animal, but the cat bargains with him, promising him riches in return for a bag and a pair of boots. Though dubious, the miller's son goes along with him and provides the items.

Puss-in-Boots takes the bag and catches a succession of items of game - rabbits, partridges, etc. - which he takes to the palace and presents to the king as presents from his master, the "[[Marquis de Carabas]]". Eventually the cat learns that the king and his beautiful daughter will be travelling by the river road. Puss-in-Boots tells the miller's son (who is ignorant of all this) to go and bathe in the river at the time that the royal party is due to pass. The boy does so, and as he bathes the cat steals his clothes, and runs to the road calling for help for his master, the Marquis de Carabas, who is drowning. The boy is "rescued" from the river, and his lack of clothes is explained as the work of robbers. He is therefore wrapped in rich robes and driven off in the king's coach.

The cat speeds ahead of the king's party to the lands of a powerful [[ogre]]. He threatens the people working in its fields that they will be chopped to bits if they don't say that the fields belong to the Marquis of Carabas. As the king's coach reaches the ogre's lands, the king asks after the ownership of the fields, and is told that they belong to the Marquis de Carabas. Puss-in-Boots goes ahead of the party, and confronts the ogre. He flatters the ogre on his magical shape-changing abilities and challenges him to turn into a mouse. The moment the ogre does so, Puss-in-Boots eats him, thus claiming the palace and lands in his master's name.

Upon reaching the ogre's palace, the royal party is welcomed by Puss-in-Boots in his master's name. The king marries the princess to the miller's son.

c.f. In Straparola's version, there is no ogre; the castle belongs to a nobleman who happened to die on a journey, and as consequence, the deceit is never revealed.

In Perrault's version, "Puss became a personage of great importance, and gave up hunting mice, except for amusement".

In Basile's and Jacobs's version, the miller's son had promised the cat to give him a funeral. The cat feigned death (in Basile's), or fell ill and looked dead (in Jacobs's). The miller's son went to throw the body in the trash. Angry, the cat rebuked him. In Basile's version, the cat, despite the pleas of the miller's son, left him; in Jacobs's, only after the miller's son summoned a doctor for her illness and pled with her did she agree to remain.

== Analysis ==
According to the [[Aarne-Thompson classification system]] of folktales, "Puss in Boots" is of the type 545B, ''The Cat as Helper''.

In many other variants of this type, such as ''[[Don Joseph Pear]]'' or ''[[How the Beggar Boy turned into Count Piro]]'', the helper is a fox.  In other variants, such as ''[[Lord Peter (fairy tale)|Lord Peter]]'', the cat is female, and marries the hero after having the enchantment removed.<ref>Maria Tatar, p 234, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', ISBN 0-393-05163-3</ref>

Compared to the rich materials provided in "[[Sleeping Beauty]]" or "[[Bluebeard]]", "Puss in Boots" is considerably more lighthearted in tone. Perrault was certainly known for his [[moralist]] tendencies, but if there is a lesson to be learned from "Puss in Boots" it seems to be that trickery and deceit pays off more rapidly (and handsomely) than do hard work and talent, or that clothes make the man.

To some readers today, an ethically discordant note is struck by the cat threatening the peasants who work for the ogre, bullying them into saying that they work for the Marquis de Carabas. This is most certainly the case, as his 'boots' are that of a "cavalier soldat" (cavalier soldier) who in truth annexes the ogre's land.  In a modern version, Puss in Boots instead doesn't learn until he meets the Peasants of the cruel ogre's tyranny, and strikes a deal with the peasants that if they call themselves the people of the Marquis de Carabas, then Puss will free them from the tyranny of the cruel ogre.

In some modern versions ogre is substituted by evil wizard, and the episode with peasants is omitted (king goes straight to the castle).
