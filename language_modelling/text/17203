The [[proton<U+2013>proton chain]] occurs around {{val|9.2|e=37}} times each second in the core of the Sun.

This mass is not destroyed to create the energy, rather, the mass is carried away ''in'' the radiated energy, as described by the concept of [[mass-energy equivalence]].

The power production by fusion in the core varies with distance from the solar center. At the center of the Sun, theoretical models estimate it to be approximately 276.5 watts/m<sup>3</sup>,<ref>[http://fusedweb.llnl.gov/CPEP/Chart_Pages/5.Plasmas/Sunlayers.html Table of temperatures, power densities, luminosities by radius in the Sun]</ref> a power production density that more nearly approximates reptile metabolism than a thermonuclear bomb.<ref group=note>A 50 kg adult human has a volume of about 0.05 m<sup>3</sup>, which corresponds to 13.8 watts, at the volumetric power of the solar center.

The tremendous power output of the Sun is not due to its high power per volume, but instead due to its large size.

The fusion rate in the core is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a slightly higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and [[thermal expansion|expand]] slightly against the [[weight]] of the outer layers, reducing the fusion rate and correcting the [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]]; and a slightly lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present level.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Haubold |first1=H.J.|last2=Mathai|first2=A.M.|date= May 18, 1994 |title=Solar Nuclear Energy Generation & The Chlorine Solar Neutrino Experiment|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9405040v1|accessdate=2009-09-24 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Myers|first=Steven T.|title=Lecture 11&nbsp;<U+2013> Stellar Structure I: Hydrostatic Equilibrium|date=1999-02-18|accessdate=15 July 2009|url=http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~smyers/courses/astro12/L11.html}}</ref>

The [[gamma ray]]s (high-energy photons) released in fusion reactions are absorbed in only a few millimeters of solar plasma and then re-emitted again in random direction and at slightly lower energy.

After a final trip through the convective outer layer to the transparent surface of the photosphere, the photons escape as [[visible light]]. Each gamma ray in the Sun's core is converted into several million photons of visible light before escaping into space. [[Neutrino]]s are also released by the fusion reactions in the core, but unlike photons they rarely interact with matter, so almost all are able to escape the Sun immediately. For many years measurements of the number of neutrinos produced in the Sun were [[Solar neutrino problem|lower than theories predicted]] by a factor of 3. This discrepancy was resolved in 2001 through the discovery of the effects of [[neutrino oscillation]]: the Sun emits the number of neutrinos predicted by the [[theory]], but neutrino detectors were missing {{frac|2|3}} of them because the neutrinos had changed [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]] by the time they were detected.<ref name="Schlattl">

===Radiative zone===
From about 0.25 to about 0.7 solar radii, solar material is hot and dense enough that [[thermal radiation]] is sufficient to transfer the intense heat of the core outward.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> This zone is free of thermal [[convection]]; while the material gets cooler from 7 to about 2 million kelvin with increasing altitude, this [[temperature gradient]] is less than the value of the [[adiabatic lapse rate]] and hence cannot drive convection.<ref name=NASA1/> Energy is transferred by [[radiation]]<U+2014>[[ions]] of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] emit [[photons]], which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The density drops a hundredfold (from 20 g/cm<sup>3</sup> to only 0.2 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) from the bottom to the top of the radiative zone.<ref name="autogenerated1"/><!-- http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008SoPh..251..101M -->

The radiative zone and the convection form a transition layer, the [[tachocline]].  This is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the radiative zone and the differential rotation of the convection zone results in a large shear<U+2014>a condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another.<ref>{{Cite book| url = http://books.google.com/?id=PLNwoJ6qFoEC&pg=PA193 | isbn = 9780849333552 | pages = 193<U+2013>235 | chapter = The solar tachocline: Formation, stability and its role in the solar dynamo | author = ed. by Andrew M.

===Convective zone===
In the Sun's outer layer, from its surface down to approximately 200,000&nbsp;km (or 70% of the solar radius), the solar plasma is not dense enough or hot enough to transfer the thermal energy of the interior outward through radiation; in other words it is opaque enough. As a result, thermal convection occurs as [[thermal|thermal columns]] carry hot material to the surface (photosphere) of the Sun. Once the material cools off at the surface, it plunges downward to the base of the convection zone, to receive more heat from the top of the radiative zone. At the visible surface of the Sun, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m<sup>3</sup> (about 1/6,000th the density of air at sea level).<ref name=NASA1/>

The thermal columns in the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the Sun as the [[granule (solar physics)|solar granulation]] and [[supergranulation]]. The turbulent convection of this outer part of the solar interior causes a "small-scale" dynamo that produces magnetic north and south poles all over the surface of the Sun.<ref name=NASA1/> The Sun's thermal columns are [[B<U+00E9>nard cells]] and therefore tend to be hexagonal prisms.<ref>

The visible surface of the Sun, the photosphere, is the layer below which the Sun becomes [[opacity (optics)|opaque]] to visible light.<ref name=Abhyankar1977/> Above the photosphere visible sunlight is free to propagate into space, and its energy escapes the Sun entirely. The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of [[Hydrogen anion|H<sup><U+2212></sup> ions]], which absorb visible light easily.<ref name=Abhyankar1977/> Conversely, the visible light we see is produced as electrons react with [[hydrogen]] atoms to produce H<sup><U+2212></sup> ions.<ref name="Gibson">

The photosphere is tens to hundreds of kilometers thick, being slightly less opaque than [[air]] on Earth. Because the upper part of the photosphere is cooler than the lower part, an image of the Sun appears brighter in the center than on the edge or ''limb'' of the solar disk, in a phenomenon known as [[limb darkening]].<ref name=Abhyankar1977/> Sunlight has approximately a [[black-body]] spectrum that indicates its temperature is about 6,000 [[kelvin|K]], interspersed with atomic [[absorption line]]s from the tenuous layers above the photosphere. The photosphere has a particle density of ~10<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;m<sup><U+2212>3</sup> (this is about 0.37% of the particle number per volume of [[Earth's atmosphere]] at sea level; however, photosphere particles are electrons and protons, so the average particle in air is 58 times as heavy).<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/sun_worldbook.html |title=Nasa&nbsp;<U+2013> Sun |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2007-11-29 |accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref>

During early studies of the [[optical spectrum]] of the photosphere, some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any [[chemical element]]s then known on Earth. In 1868, [[Norman Lockyer]] hypothesized that these absorption lines were because of a new element which he dubbed ''[[helium]]'', after the Greek Sun god [[Helios]]. It was not until 25 years later that helium was isolated on Earth.<ref name="Lockyer">

All matter in the Sun is in the form of [[gas]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] because of its high temperatures. This makes it possible for the Sun to rotate faster at its equator (about 25 days) than it does at higher latitudes (about 35 days near its poles). The [[solar rotation|differential rotation]] of the Sun's latitudes causes its [[magnetic field]] lines to become twisted together over time, causing [[Coronal loop|magnetic field loops]] to erupt from the Sun's surface and trigger the formation of the Sun's dramatic [[sunspot]]s and [[solar prominence]]s (see [[magnetic reconnection]]). This twisting action creates the [[solar dynamo]] and an 11-year [[sunspot cycle|solar cycle]] of magnetic activity as the Sun's magnetic field reverses itself about every 11 years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/02/16/sun.flips/index.html |title= Sci-Tech&nbsp;<U+2013> Space&nbsp;<U+2013> Sun flips magnetic field  |date= 2001-02-16|accessdate=2009-07-11 | work=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast15feb_1.htm |title=The Sun Does a Flip |publisher=Science.nasa.gov |date=2001-02-15 |accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref>

The solar magnetic field extends well beyond the Sun itself. The magnetized solar wind plasma carries Sun's magnetic field into the space forming what is called the [[interplanetary magnetic field]].<ref name=Russell2001/> Since the plasma can only move along the magnetic field lines, the interplanetary magnetic field is initially stretched radially away from the Sun. Because the fields above and below the solar equator have different polarities pointing towards and away from the Sun, there exists a thin current layer in the solar equatorial plane, which is called the [[heliospheric current sheet]].<ref name=Russell2001/> At the large distances the rotation of the Sun twists the magnetic field and the current sheet into the [[Archimedean spiral]] like structure called the [[Parker spiral]].<ref name=Russell2001/> The interplanetary magnetic field is much stronger than the dipole component of the solar magnetic field. The Sun's 50<U+2013>400&nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|<U+03BC>T]] (in the photosphere) magnetic dipole field reduces with the cube of the distance to about 0.1&nbsp;nT at the distance of the Earth.

===Sunspots and the sunspot cycle===
[[File:Solar-cycle-data.png|thumb|right|Measurements of solar cycle variation during the last 30 years]]
When observing the Sun with appropriate filtration, the most immediately visible features are usually its [[sunspot]]s, which are well-defined surface areas that appear darker than their surroundings because of lower temperatures. Sunspots are regions of intense magnetic activity where [[convection]] is inhibited by strong magnetic fields, reducing energy transport from the hot interior to the surface. The magnetic field causes strong heating in the corona, forming [[active region]]s that are the source of intense [[solar flare]]s and [[coronal mass ejection]]s. The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.<ref name="Sunspot2001">

The number of sunspots visible on the Sun is not constant, but varies over an 11-year cycle known as the [[solar cycle]]. At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none at all can be seen. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the sunspot cycle progresses, the number of sunspots increases and they move closer to the equator of the Sun, a phenomenon described by [[Sp<U+00F6>rer's law]]. Sunspots usually exist as pairs with opposite magnetic polarity. The magnetic polarity of the leading sunspot alternates every solar cycle, so that it will be a north magnetic pole in one solar cycle and a south magnetic pole in the next.<ref name="solarcycle">

The Sun is about halfway through its [[main sequence|main-sequence]] [[stellar evolution|evolution]], during which [[stellar nucleosynthesis|nuclear fusion]] reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than four million [[metric ton]]s of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing [[neutrino]]s and [[solar radiation]]. At this rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 Earth-masses of matter into energy. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years as a main sequence star.<ref>

The Apex of the Sun's Way, or the [[solar apex]], is the direction that the Sun travels through space in the Milky Way, relative to other nearby stars. The general direction of the Sun's galactic motion is towards the star [[Vega]] in the constellation of [[Lyra]] at an angle of roughly 60 sky degrees to the direction of the [[Galactic Center]].

The Sun's orbit around the Galaxy is expected to be roughly elliptical with the addition of perturbations due to the galactic spiral arms and non-uniform mass distributions. In addition the Sun oscillates up and down relative to the galactic plane approximately 2.7 times per orbit. This is very similar to how a [[simple harmonic oscillator]] works with no drag force (damping) term.

===Faint young Sun problem===
{{Main|Faint young Sun paradox}}

Theoretical models of the Sun's development suggest that 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago, during the [[Archean|Archean period]], the Sun was only about 75% as bright as it is today. Such a weak star would not have been able to sustain liquid water on the Earth's surface, and thus life should not have been able to develop. However, the geological record demonstrates that the Earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history, and that the young Earth was somewhat warmer than it is today. The consensus among scientists is that the young Earth's atmosphere contained much larger quantities of [[greenhouse gas]]es (such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and/or [[ammonia]]) than are present today, which trapped enough heat to compensate for the smaller amount of [[solar energy]] reaching the planet.<ref name="Kasting">

==History of observation==
===Early understanding and etymology===
[[File:Solvogn.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Trundholm Sun chariot]] pulled by a horse is a sculpture believed to be illustrating an important part of [[Nordic Bronze Age]] mythology. The sculpture is probably from around 1350 [[Anno Domini|BC]]. It is displayed at the [[National Museum of Denmark]].]]

The English proper noun ''sun'' developed from [[Old English]] ''sunne'' (around 725, attested in ''[[Beowulf]]''), and may be related to ''[[south]]''. Cognates to English ''sun'' appear in other [[Germanic languages]], including [[Old Frisian]] ''sunne'', ''sonne'' ("sun"), [[Old Saxon]] ''sunna'', [[Middle Dutch]] ''sonne'', modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''zon'', [[Old High German]] ''sunna'', modern [[German language|German]] ''Sonne'', [[Old Norse]] ''sunna'', and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''sunn<U+014D>''. All Germanic terms for the Sun stem from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''sunn<U+014D>n''.<ref name=BARNHART776>Barnhart, Robert K. (1995) The Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology, page 776. HarperCollins.

''In Search of the Indo-Europeans: Language, Archaeology and Myth'', page 129. [[Thames & Hudson]]. ISBN 0500276161</ref>

Theories have been proposed that Sun, as [[List of Germanic deities and heroes|Germanic goddess]], may represent an extension of an earlier [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] deity due to [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European linguistic]] connections between Norse ''S<U+00F3>l'', [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Surya]]'', [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] ''[[Sulis]]'', [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''[[Saul<U+0117>]]'', and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''[[Solnitse]]''.<ref name=MALLORY129/>

Humanity's most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as the luminous disk in the [[sky]], whose presence above the [[horizon]] creates day and whose absence causes night. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun was thought to be a [[solar deity]] or other [[supernatural]] phenomenon. [[Sun worship|Worship]] of the Sun was central to civilizations such as the [[Inca]] of [[South America]] and the [[Aztec]]s of what is now [[Mexico]]. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone [[megalith]]s accurately mark the summer or winter [[solstice]] (some of the most prominent megaliths are located in [[Nabta Playa]], [[Egypt]], [[Mnajdra]], Malta and at [[Stonehenge]], England); [[Newgrange]], a prehistoric human-built mount in [[Ireland]], was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]] at [[Chich<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>]] in Mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the [[pyramid]] at the vernal and autumn [[equinox]]es.

In the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|late Roman Empire]] the Sun's birthday was a holiday celebrated as [[Sol Invictus]] (literally "unconquered sun") soon after the winter solstice which may have been an antecedent to [[Christmas]]. Regarding the [[fixed star]]s, the Sun appears from Earth to revolve once a year along the [[ecliptic]] through the [[zodiac]], and so Greek astronomers considered it to be one of the seven [[planet]]s (Greek ''planetes'', "wanderer"), after which the seven days of the [[week]] are named in some languages.<ref name=oed>{{Cite web| url= http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50180718?query_type=word&queryword=planet | publisher = Oxford English Dictionary| title = planet, n.| accessdate=2008-02-07 | month=December | year=2007}} ''Note: select the Etymology tab ''</ref><ref name=almagest>{{Cite journal|first=Bernard R.|last=Goldstein|title=Saving the phenomena : the background to Ptolemy's planetary theory| journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy | volume=28 | issue=1 | year=1997 | pages=1<U+2013>12 | location=Cambridge (UK) |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997JHA....28....1G|accessdate=2008-02-06|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Ptolemy's Almagest|author= Ptolemy|coauthors=Toomer, G.

===Development of scientific understanding===
In the early first millennium [[B.C.E.]], [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers]] observed that the Sun's motion along the [[ecliptic]] was not uniform, though they were unaware of why this was; it is today known that this is due to the [[Earth]] moving in an [[elliptic orbit]] around the Sun, with the Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at [[Apsis|perihelion]] and moving slower when it is farther away at [[Apsis|aphelion]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Babylon to Voyager and beyond: a history of planetary astronomy|author=David Leverington|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=0521808405|pages=6<U+2013>7|ref=harv|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

One of the first people to offer a scientific or philosophical explanation for the Sun was the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Anaxagoras]], who reasoned that it was a giant flaming ball of metal even larger than the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] rather than the [[chariot]] of [[Helios]], and that the [[Moon]] reflected the light of the Sun.<ref>

The theory that the Sun is the center around which the planets move was first proposed by the ancient Greek [[Aristarchus of Samos]] in the 3rd century BCE, and later adopted by [[Seleucus of Seleucia]] (see [[Heliocentrism]]). This largely philosophical view was developed into fully predictive [[mathematical model]] of a heliocentric system in the 16th century by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. In the early 17th century, the invention of the [[telescope]] permitted detailed observations of [[sunspot]]s by [[Thomas Harriot]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and other astronomers. Galileo made some of the first known telescopic observations of sunspots and posited that they were on the surface of the Sun rather than small objects passing between the Earth and the Sun.<ref>

Just a few months after launch, however, an electronics failure caused the probe to go into standby mode, and it spent the next three years in this inactive state. In 1984 [[Space Shuttle Challenger]] mission STS-41C retrieved the satellite and repaired its electronics before re-releasing it into orbit.

Launched in 1991, Japan's [[Yohkoh]] (''Sunbeam'') satellite observed solar flares at X-ray wavelengths. Mission data allowed scientists to identify several different types of flares, and demonstrated that the corona away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had previously been supposed.

All these satellites have observed the Sun from the plane of the ecliptic, and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail. The [[Ulysses probe]] was launched in 1990 to study the Sun's polar regions. It first travelled to [[Jupiter]], to "slingshot" past the planet into an orbit which would take it far above the plane of the ecliptic. Serendipitously, it was well-placed to observe the collision of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] with Jupiter in 1994. Once Ulysses was in its scheduled orbit, it began observing the solar wind and magnetic field strength at high solar latitudes, finding that the solar wind from high latitudes was moving at about 750&nbsp;km/s which was slower than expected, and that there were large magnetic waves emerging from high latitudes which scattered galactic [[cosmic ray]]s.<ref>

Two identical spacecraft were launched into orbits that cause them to (respectively) pull further ahead of and fall gradually behind the Earth. This enables [[stereoscopic]] imaging of the Sun and solar phenomena, such as [[coronal mass ejections]].<ref name=inst>{{Cite web| date = March 8, 2006 | url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/spacecraft/index.html | title = STEREO Spacecraft & Instruments | work = NASA Missions | accessdate = May 30, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| title= Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI)|author= Howard R.

Viewing the Sun through light-concentrating [[optics]] such as [[binoculars]] is very hazardous without an appropriate filter that blocks UV and substantially dims the sunlight. An [[neutral density filter|attenuating (ND) filter]] might not filter UV and so is still dangerous. Attenuating filters to view the Sun should be specifically designed for that use: some improvised filters pass UV or [[infrared|IR]] rays that can harm the eye at high brightness levels.<ref>

Unfiltered binoculars can deliver over 500 times as much energy to the retina as using the naked eye, killing retinal cells almost instantly (even though the power per unit area of image on the retina is the same, the heat cannot dissipate fast enough because the image is larger). Even brief glances at the midday Sun through unfiltered binoculars can cause permanent blindness.<ref name="Marsh">

Partial [[solar eclipse]]s are hazardous to view because the eye's [[pupil]] is not adapted to the unusually high visual contrast: the pupil dilates according to the total amount of light in the field of view, ''not'' by the brightest object in the field. During partial eclipses most sunlight is blocked by the [[Moon]] passing in front of the Sun, but the uncovered parts of the photosphere have the same [[surface brightness]] as during a normal day. In the overall gloom, the pupil expands from ~2&nbsp;mm to ~6&nbsp;mm, and each retinal cell exposed to the solar image receives about ten times more light than it would looking at the non-eclipsed Sun. This can damage or kill those cells, resulting in small permanent blind spots for the viewer.<ref name="Espenak">

A rare [[optical phenomenon]] may occur shortly after sunset or before sunrise, known as a [[green flash]]. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being [[refraction|bent]] (usually through a [[temperature inversion]]) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is [[Rayleigh scattering|scattered]] more, leaving light that is perceived as [[green]].<ref>

[[Ultraviolet]] light from the Sun has [[antiseptic]] properties and can be used to sanitize tools and water. It also causes sunburn, and has other medical effects such as the production of [[vitamin D]]. Ultraviolet light is strongly attenuated by Earth's [[ozone layer]], so that the amount of UV varies greatly with [[latitude]] and has been partially responsible for many biological adaptations, including variations in human [[skin color]] in different regions of the globe.<ref>

{{See also|The Sun in human culture}}
Like other natural phenomena, the Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures throughout human history, and was the source of the word [[Sunday]]. Its formal name in the English language is, per the [[International Astronomical Union]], the Sun (capitalized as a proper noun).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/themes/naming/#spelling|title=Naming Astronomical Objects: Spelling of Names|publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]]|accessdate=29 March 2010}}</ref> The [[Latin]] name ''Sol'', for the [[Sol (mythology)|Sun god]] of the same name, {{pron-en|<U+02C8>s<U+0252>l}} (rhyming with ''doll'') in English, is widely known but not common in general English language use; the adjectival form is the related word ''solar''.<ref>William Little (ed.) ''Oxford Universal Dictionary'', 1955. See entry on "Sol".</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Sol "Sol"], Merriam-Webster online, accessed July 19, 2009</ref> "Sol" is, however, the modern word for "Sun" in many [[European languages]].<ref>This includes [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Galician language|Galician]].{{Cite web|title= Total Solar Eclipse in Other Languages|publisher=mreclipse.com|url=http://www.mreclipse.com/Special/SElanguage.html|accessdate=2009-07-17}} In addition, the [[Peru]]vian [[currency]] [[Peruvian nuevo sol|nuevo sol]] is named after the Sun (in Spanish), like its successor (and predecessor, in use 1985<U+2013>1991) the [[Peruvian inti|Inti]] (in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]). In [[Persian language|Persian]], ''sol'' means "[[solar year]]".</ref>
