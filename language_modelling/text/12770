'''''A Star-Crossed Wasteland''''' is the third studio album by American [[metalcore]] band [[In This Moment]]. The album was first released in Germany on July 9, 2010 and later in the United States by [[Century Media Records|Century Media]] and was named by [[Alternative Press]] as one of the most anticipated releases of 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/interviews/a/inthismomentinterview2009.htm |title=In This Moment, "One of The Most Anticipated Releases of 2010" |date=December 9, 2009 |publisher=barebonesmusic.com}}</ref> It's the first album recorded and produced with their new bassist, Kyle Konkiel.

==Background==
Before the band started their first headlining tour in late 2009, vocalist Maria Brink announced that they had begun writing songs for their upcoming third album to be released the following summer. In January, the band described the sounds of A Star-Crossed Wasteland in a [[Myspace]] posting, talking about their plans for 2010:

{{cquote|As far as direction for the new album everyone in the band is feeling a heavier/ darker vibe, We want the lush production and melodic layers from "The Dream" with the raw power and aggression from "Beautiful Tragedy" all mixed together...we are the kind of band that musically does what we want, from the heart, we do not follow trends or fads,  the new ITM album will be no exception, we are writing from our heart and I can promise you what you hear from us next will be 100% THE REAL DEAL, no flavor of the week bullshit here.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/interviews/a/inthismomentinterview2009.htm |title=2010 Here We Come |date=January 2, 2010 |publisher=myspace.com/inthismoment}}</ref> |}}

Brink says working with Churko was the obvious choice: "We worked with Kevin Churko on the last album, and that<U+2019>s who we want. He<U+2019>s our dude. He can take the second album that we just had, still go heavy, but not sound just like our first album and grow into something new and evolved. We want to move up without sounding like we<U+2019>ve gone backwards."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/interviews/a/inthismomentinterview2009.htm |title=In This Moment Interview |date=August 5, 2009 |publisher=about.com}}</ref>

Production and recording began in February 2010 at the Wolve's Den in Las Vegas. This is also the first studio album to feature new bass player, Kyle Konkiel. The album was completed in April and Brink announced the release date during an interview at the Revolver Golden God Awards.

==About the album==
In January 2009, Brink revealed two working song titles, The Gun Show and The World Is On Fire on her website. Lyrically, Brink drew inspiration from her personal life, mostly the ending of her relationship with [[Devildriver]] bassist [[Jon Miller]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/interview/2398/624/In-This-Moment.html |title=In This Moment Interview: Chris Howorth |date=July 10, 2010 |publisher=The Gauntlet}}</ref> She describes her experiences on the album title and it's meaning, "I wrote about my experiences and kinda this metaphorical story type thing. There is definitely an underlying theme for this whole entire album of this post-apocalyptic wasteland world and 'star-crossed lovers' is obviously where these two people are meant to basically fail and it's not gonna work out, so it's this Star-Crossed Wasteland world."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.101distribution.com/article/int10 |title=In This Moment: A Princess and her Cowboys |date=June 14, 2010 |publisher=101distribution.com}}</ref>

The sound of A Star-Crossed Wasteland takes elements from both [[Beautiful Tragedy]] and The Dream, but with a darker and heavier sound. Chris Howorth describes: "We went in a much heavier direction on this album. We feel it<U+2019>s our defining album. Just the right mix of aggression and melody."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themetalden.com/index.php?p=14265 |title=Rocket Interviews In This Moment Guitarist Chris Howorth |date=June 14, 2010 |publisher=themetalden.com}}</ref> Howorth also does the backing vocals for many of the songs such as "Iron Army", "The Road", and "The Last Cowboy". "The Promise" is a duet featuring vocals by Adrian Patrick, lead singer of Otherwise. Originally, the male vocal parts were intended for [[Ivan L. Moody]] of [[Five Finger Death Punch]].

==Promotion and tour==
A teaser trailer was released on May 19 containing a small snippet of a new song, "[[The Gun Show (In This Moment Song)|The Gun Show]]". A few weeks later, a new trailer was released featuring a extended clip of the song, a first look at the music video and also a glimpse of the album cover artwork. 

On June 1, "[[The Gun Show (In This Moment Song)|The Gun Show]]" premiered on [[Sirius XM Radio]] Liquid Metal channel along with a interview with Brink. Three other songs were also premiered that night including "Iron Army", "Standing Alone", and "Blazin". On June 14, clips of the album can be previewed on iTunes, a full month before the release date. Another track, "Just Drive" was made available for online streaming on July 3. The entire album was available for streaming on July 9.

===Tour===
In late 2009, Brink and Howorth revealed that they will be participating in a summer festival for 2010. It was later announced that they will be playing a part of [[Rockstar (drink)|Rockstar]] energy drink's [[Mayhem Festival 2010]], which will be co-headlined by [[Korn]] and [[Rob Zombie]]. The tour will last for five weeks, kicking off July 10 and ending on August 14.

===Singles===
* [[The Gun Show (In This Moment Song)|The Gun Show]] is the first single and was released on [[iTunes]] on June 1. The song was also available for streaming on their [[Myspace]] and [[Facebook]] page on June 8.
* "The Promise" will be the albums second single and first track for radio active rock. A video for the song has also been filmed around the same time as "The Gun Show".

Lenny Vowels of the 411mania.com gave ''A Star-Crossed wasteland'' 7 out of 10 stars which is "good" according to the 411 Legend and summarized his review by saying "As a whole, with this album, it seemed like In This Moment finally took the necessary steps towards becoming a bigger band in America. The album sounds quite a bit more mainstream than their previous two releases. It's not so much bad as it is hit-and-miss. Thankfully, it's mostly a hit. While I certainly can't say I'm a fan of everything on this album, the positive sides bring the goods. Maybe this will be the album that finally gets In This Moment the amount of exposure they need in the U.S."<ref name="411 Review">{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/music/album_reviews/146068 |title=In This Moment - A Star-Crossed Wasteland Review }}</ref>Phil Freeman of AllMusic compared the album's sound to the works of [[Italy|Italian]] [[gothic metal]] band [[Lacuna Coil]] and stated "Established fans of In This Moment will love A Star-Crossed Wasteland, but as their best album, it's also a perfect introduction for a newcomer."<ref name="AMG Review"/>
