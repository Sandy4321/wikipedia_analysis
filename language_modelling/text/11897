The '''Martinique macaw''' or '''orange-bellied macaw'''<ref name="Extinct Birds"/> (''Ara martinica'') is an [[hypothetical extinct species]] of [[macaw]] which may have been [[endemic]] to the island of [[Martinique]], an island in the eastern [[Caribbean Sea]]. It was scientifically named by [[Walter Rothschild]] in 1905, based on a 1630s description of "blue and orange-yellow" macaws by [[P<U+00E8>re Jacques Bouton]]. No other evidence of its existence is known, but it may have been identified in contemporary artwork. Some writers have suggested that the birds observed were actually [[blue-and-yellow macaw]]s (''Ara ararauna''). The "red-tailed blue-and-yellow macaw" (''Ara erythrura''), another species described by Rothschild in 1907 based on a 1658 account, is thought to be identical to the Martinique macaw, if either has ever existed.

The Martinique macaw is one of thirteen [[extinct]] macaw species that have been proposed to have lived in the Caribbean islands. Many of these species are now considered dubious because only two are known from physical remains, and there are no extant endemic macaws on the islands today. Macaws were frequently transported between the Caribbean islands and the South American mainland in both prehistoric and historic times, so it is impossible to know whether contemporaneous reports refer to imported or native species.

The Martinique macaw was [[scientifically described]] by [[Walter Rothschild]] in 1905, as a new [[species]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Anodorhynchus]]'', ''A. martinicus''. The [[taxon]] was solely based on a 1630s account by [[P<U+00E8>re Jacques Bouton]] of blue and orange-yellow [[macaw]]s from the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Martinique]].<ref>{{Cite journal  | last = Rothschild  | first = W.  | author-link =  | title = Notes on extinct parrots from the West Indies | journal = Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club  | series =   | volume = 16  | pages = 13<U+2013>15  | url = http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/32432777#page/37/mode/1up  | year = 1905 }}</ref> Rothschild reclassified the species as ''[[Ara (genus)|Ara]] martinicus'' in his 1907 book, ''[[Extinct Birds (Rothschild book)|Extinct Birds]]'', which also contained a restoration of the bird by [[John Gerrard Keulemans]].<ref name="Rothschild">{{Cite book

In 1906, [[Tommaso Salvadori]] noted that the Martinique macaw seemed similar to the [[blue-and-yellow macaw]] (''Ara ararauna'') of mainland South America, and may had been the same bird.<ref name="Salvadori"/> [[James Greenway]] suggested Bouton's description could have been based on a captive bird. "Edwards' [[Dodo]]", a 1626 painting by [[Roelant Savery]], shows several birds including a blue and yellow macaw, which is different from the mainland bird in having yellow undertail [[covert feathers]] instead of blue, but the origin of this macaw is unknown.<ref name =Greenway/> Exactly what Boulton was describing is likely to remain a mystery.<ref name = Fuller1987/> In 1936, a Cuban scientist claimed to have found a stuffed Martinique macaw specimen, which was supposed to have been collected in 1845. After examination it was shown to be a [[hoax]], combining a [[burrowing parakeet]] (''Cyanoliseus patagonus byroni'') with the tail of a [[dove]].<ref name="Cuban Macaw"/>

In the article that named the Martinique macaw, Rothschild also listed an "''Anodorhynchus coeruleus''", supposedly from [[Jamaica]]. Salvadori also questioned this in 1906, as he was unsure what Rothschild was referring to.<ref name="Salvadori">{{Cite doi|10.1111/j.1474-919X.1906.tb07813.x}}</ref> In his ''Extinct Birds'', Rothschild clarified that his first description was erroneous, as he had misread an old description.

===Extinct Caribbean macaws===
[[File:Blue and yellow macaw.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Unidentified parrot supposedly from Jamaica, which may be the Martinique macaw, by [[Eleazar Albin]], mid-1700s]] 
Macaws are known to have been transported between the Caribbean islands and from mainland South America both in historic times by Europeans and natives, and prehistoric times by [[Paleoamericans]]. Parrots were important in the culture of native Caribbeans, were traded between islands, and were among the gifts offered to [[Christopher Columbus]] when he reached the [[Bahamas]] in 1492. It is therefore difficult to determine whether the numerous historical records of macaws on these islands refer to distinct, [[endemic]] species, since they could have been based on escaped individuals or feral populations of foreign macaws of known species that had been transported there.<ref name = Olson/> As many as thirteen [[extinct]] macaws have been suggested to have lived on the islands until recently.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.3366/anh.2010.0016}}</ref> Only two endemic Caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains; the [[Cuban macaw]] (''Ara tricolor'') is known from nineteen museum skins and [[subfossils]], and the [[Saint Croix macaw]] (''Ara autochthones''), is only known from subfossils.<ref name = Olson>{{cite journal|last= Olson|first= S.

Many hypothetical extinct macaws were based only on contemporaneous accounts, but these species are considered dubious today. Several of them were named in the early 20th century by Rothschild, who had a tendency to name species based on little tangible evidence.<ref name = Fuller1987>{{cite book |title = Extinct Birds |pages = 233<U+2013>236 |first = E. |last = Fuller | year = 1987| publisher = Penguin Books (England) |isbn = 0-670-81787-2}}</ref> Among others, the [[Lesser Antillean macaw]] (''Ara guadeloupensis'') and the [[violet macaw]] (''Anodorhynchus purpurascens'') were based on reports of macaws on [[Guadeloupe]], the [[red-headed macaw]] (''Ara erythrocephala'') and the [[Jamaican red macaw]] (''Ara gossei'') were named for accounts of macaws on Jamaica, and the [[Dominican green-and-yellow macaw]] (''Ara atwoodi'') was supposedly from [[Dominica island]].<ref name="Rothschild"/>

Other species of macaw have also been mentioned, but many never received [[binomials]], or are considered [[junior synonyms]] of other species.<ref name="Extinct Birds"/> Williams and Steadman defended the validity of most named Caribbean macaw species, and wrote that each Greater and Lesser Antillean island had its own endemic species.<ref name = Williams/> Olson and Ma<U+00ED>z doubted the validity of the hypothetical macaws, and that all Antillean islands once had endemic species, but wrote that the island of [[Hispaniola]] would be the most likely place for another macaw species to have existed because of the large land area, though no descriptions or remains of such are known. They wrote that such a species could have been driven to extinction before the arrival of Europeans.<ref name = Olson/> The prehistoric distribution of indigenous macaws in the Caribbean can only be determined through further palaeontological discoveries.<ref name="Cuban skull">{{Cite journal

==Contemporary descriptions==
[[File:Ara Erythrura.jpg|thumb|upright|Keulemans' hypothetical 1907 restoration of ''Ara erythrura'']] 
Bouton's original description of the Martinique macaw is reproduced below, translated from French:
{{Quotation|The macaws are two or three times as large as the other parrots, [and] have a plumage much different in colour: those that I have seen have their plumage blue and orange-yellow (saffron). They also learn to talk and have a good body.<ref name="Rothschild"/><ref name = ExtinctionWebsiteAramartinica>{{cite web| publisher =The Extinction Website (2008) |url = http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/speciesinfo/martiniquemacaw.htm |title = Species Info: ''Ara martinica'' |accessdate = 5 October 2008 }}</ref>}}
A translation of the original French description of "''Ara erythrura''" by de Rochefort follows below:
{{Quotation|Among them are some which have the head, the upper side of the neck, and the back of a satiny sky blue; the underside of the neck, the belly, and undersurface of the wings, yellow, and the tail entirely red.<ref name="Rothschild"/>}}
In spite of the fact that the tail of "''Ara erythrura''" was described as entirely red, the plate in Rothschild's ''Extinct Birds'' showed a blue tip, which [[Charles Wallace Richmond]] complained about in his review of the book.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.2307/4070727}}</ref>
