'''Clare Balding''' (born 29 January 1971 in [[Kingsclere]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]]) is a [[BBC]] [[sports]] [[presenter]], [[journalist]] and [[jockey]].

== Background ==

In 1989 and 1990, she was a leading [[amateur]] [[flat racing|flat]] [[jockey]] and Champion Lady Rider in 1990.

She was educated at [[Downe House School|Downe House]], in [[Berkshire]], and studied [[English language|English]] at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]] where she was President of the [[Cambridge Union Society]] in Easter 1992 and graduated in 1993 with a 2:1 honours degree.

== Career ==
She became a trainee with BBC National Radio in 1994, working on [[BBC Radio Five Live|5 Live]], [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] (presenting the sport on the [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] Breakfast Show), [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] and [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]. In 1995, she made her debut as a television presenter during [[Royal Ascot]]. She became BBC horse racing presenter in December 1997 after the retirement of [[Julian Wilson (broadcaster)|Julian Wilson]] and has fronted coverage of a number of [[Grand National]]s.

She has reported from four [[Olympic Games]], for BBC radio in Atlanta and for BBC Television in Sydney, Athens and Beijing. She has presented two [[Paralympic Games]], the [[Winter Olympics]] from Turin and the [[Commonwealth Games]] from Melbourne. She is the face of the BBC's [[rugby league]] coverage, having presented Grandstand from a [[Rugby League Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup]] semi final, and having been so impressed by the vibrancy and physical challenge of the sport she requested to cover further rugby league events. 

Balding was the [[Royal Television Society]]'s "Sports Presenter of the Year" in 2003. In the same year, she won the "Racing Journalist of the Year Award" and has followed up with the award for "Racing Broadcaster of the Year".

She also presents the [[Lord Mayor's Show]] as well as other live events for the BBC such as [[Trooping the Colour]] and New Year's Eve. In March 2010 she presented [[Channel Four]]'s coverage of [[Crufts]].<ref>http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dfs-crufts-2010 "dfs crufts 2010" channel4.com Retrieved 11 March 2010</ref>

She also presents the walking programme ''Ramblings'' for [[BBC Radio 4]] (where she also stands-in on the ''[[Saturday Live (radio series)|Saturday Live]]'' programme), [[The Championships Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] for 5 Live and has written regular columns for ''[[The Observer]]'', the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' and ''[[Sporting Life (newspaper)|The Sporting Life]]''.

During the [[2009 Grand National]], Balding commented on winning jockey [[Liam Treadwell]]'s teeth, and suggested that he could "get them done" with his prize fund.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1167902/BBC-presenter-Clare-Balding-humiliates-Grand-National-winning-jockey-jibe-crooked-teeth.html|title= BBC presenter Clare Balding humiliates Grand National winning jockey with jibe about his crooked teeth|publisher= Mail Online|first= Paul|last= Revoir|date= 6 April 2009|accessdate= 28 April 2009}}</ref> The [[BBC]] received 1,477 complaints about the comment,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7985464.stm|title= Presenter sorry over teeth jibe|publisher= BBC News|date= 5 April 2009|accessdate= 6 April 2009}}</ref> leading to an apology from both the presenter and the BBC.

==Family and personal life ==
She has close family links to horse racing: her father, [[Ian Balding]], trained [[Mill Reef]], 1971 winner of the [[Epsom Derby]], [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]] and [[King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes]], and her brother, [[Andrew Balding]], trained the winner of the 2003 [[Epsom Oaks]]. The latter win led to a very emotional post-race interview with her brother. Furthermore, her grandfather was the trainer [[Sir William Bass, 2nd Baronet|Peter Hastings-Bass]] and her maternal uncle [[Earl of Huntingdon|the 17th Earl of Huntingdon]] former trainer to [[Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Her maternal grandmother Priscilla is descended from the [[Earl of Derby|Earls of Derby]].

In September 2006, she formalised her relationship with the [[BBC Radio 4]] continuity announcer and newsreader [[Alice Arnold]] by entering into a [[Civil partnerships in the United Kingdom|civil partnership]].<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=405769&in_page_id=1770 ''Daily Mail'': "Balding finally steps out with lesbian lover"].</ref> They live in [[Chiswick]], [[London]].

On 29 May 2009, Balding announced that she has [[Thyroid neoplasm|thyroid cancer]]. She told the ''Daily Mail'' newspaper that she had her thyroid gland removed and would have radioactive iodine treatment in July that year.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1189332/BBC-sports-presenter-Clare-Balding-battling-thyroid-cancer.html|publisher= ''Daily Mail''|title= "BBC sports presenter Clare Balding is battling thyroid cancer"|date= 29 May 2009|accessdate= 29 May 2009}}</ref> She promised to be back on television covering the Epsom Derby, by the following Saturday. On 21 August 2009 she announced on her website the results from a post-treatment scan which showed the radioactive iodine had been successful with no signs of the thyroid cancer having spread anywhere else.

In July 2010, Balding made a complaint to the [[Press Complaints Commission]] over an article by writer [[A. A. Gill]] in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' newspaper that mocked her sexuality and appearance<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-10817463|title= Clare Balding makes Sunday Times sex jibe complaint|publisher= BBC News|date= 30 July 2010|accessdate= 30 July 2010}}</ref> following a letter from editor [[John Witherow]] she found unsatisfactory.<ref>Caroline Davies [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/30/clare-balding-lesbian-complaint-gill "Clare Balding complains to press watchdog over 'dyke' jibe"], ''The Guardian'', 30 July 2010</ref>

== Charitable activity ==
