The '''Fritz J. and Dolores H. Russ Prize''' is an award established by The [[United States National Academy of Engineering]] (NAE) in October 1999. This Prize recognizes engineering achievement that "has had a significant impact on society and has contributed to the advancement of the human condition through widespread use." As of 2007, the Russ Prize is given for work in bioengineering. The NAE awards the prize [[biennially]], the winners receives $500,000  and a gold medallion. Along with the [[Gordon Prize]] and the [[Draper Prize]], the Russ Prize comprises the "[[List of prizes known as the Nobel of a field|Nobel Prizes of Engineering]]". The Prize is named after [[Fritz Russ]], the founder of [[Systems Research Laboratories]], and his wife [[Dolores Russ]].<ref name="award">{{cite web|url=http://www.nae.edu/nae/awardscom.nsf/weblinks/NAEW-4NHMED?OpenDocument|publisher=NAE|title=Fritz J. and Dolores H.
