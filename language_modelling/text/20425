'''''Litoria wilcoxii''''' is a species of [[frog]] in the family [[Hylidae]].<ref name=frost>{{cite web |url=http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/?action=names&taxon=Litoria+wilcoxii |title=''Litoria wilcoxii'' G<U+00FC>nther, 1864 |author=Frost, Darrel R. |year=2013 |work=Amphibian Species of the World 5.6, an Online Reference |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref> Also known as the '''stony-creek frog''',<ref>{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Michelle|title=Wildlife of Greater Brisbane|year=2007|publisher=Queensland Museum|location=Brisbane|isbn=978-0-9775943-1-3|pages=219}}</ref> '''eastern stony creek frog'''<ref>{{cite web|last=Hines|first=Harry B.|title=Litoria wilcoxii - eastern stony creek frog|url=http://wetlandinfo.derm.qld.gov.au/wetlands/factsfigures/FloraAndFauna/Species/litoria-wilcoxii.html|work=Queensland Government Wetlandinfo|publisher=Queensland Government|accessdate=1/12/2012}}</ref> and '''Wilcox's frog''',<ref>{{cite web|last=Deane|first=Lewis|title=Wilcox's Frog or Stony Creek Frog|url=http://dl.id.au/g.php?c=5&i=19|work=Australian Frogs Gallery|publisher=dl.id.au|accessdate=1/12/2012}}</ref>  it is [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Australia]], being found solely on the eastern coast between [[Ingham, Queensland|Ingham]], [[QLD]], and [[Sydney]], [[NSW]], and as far west as [[Atherton, Queensland|Atherton]], [[QLD]].<ref name=ryan>{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Michelle|title=Wildlife of Greater Brisbane|year=2007|publisher=Queensland Museum|location=Brisbane|isbn=978-0-9775943-1-3|pages=219}}</ref>
Its natural [[habitat]]s are subtropical or tropical dry [[forest]]s, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, [[river]]s, intermittent rivers, and pastureland.<ref name=IUCN/>

== Description==
''Litoria wilcoxii'' shows extreme [[sexual dimorphism]], meaning the males and females have different appearances. Females can reach a length of up to 70 mm and males 45 mm. Individuals are a smooth brown in colour with speckling and blotching in the groin. A thick black stripe extends from the nostril to the base of the forearm, encompassing the eye and [[tympanum (zoology)|tympanum]] The lower underside and groin can be from a light yellow to olive green, tending more often towards a beige brown. The thighs will reflect this colouration, though more brightly. Females fit this description year round, but males turn a bright yellow to yellow-orange during mating season.  As with most members of the ''[[Litoria]]'' genus, they have climbing discs on their fingers and toes.<ref name=ryan/> 

The stony creek frog's snout is very useful in the wild. It enables it to stay low under water so it can stay away from predators. The snout acts as a ventilation system. When swimming underwater, the snout will stick slightly above the water so  it can breathe.

==Reproduction==
<!--[[File:Litoria wilcoxii metamorph.jpg|thumb|Metamorph of ''L. wilcoxii'']]-->
Males call will a very soft purring from debris such as rocks, vegetation or the ground immediately next to the water body.<ref name=ryan/>

Once the female has located the male, the pair will enter [[amplexus]]. Eggs will be laid in a single submerged cluster attached to a sediment.<ref name=ryan/>

==Threats==
It is threatened by [[habitat loss]], destruction of its native environment, in particular spawning locations, is leading to a decline in the number of this species. 
As with a great variety of Australian frog species, [[chytridiomycosis]] poses great threats to the future of this species, with some locales experiencing 28% infection rate.<ref name="Amphibia Web">{{Cite web|url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Litoria&where-species=wilcoxii|title=Litoria wilcoxii|accessdate=2012-11-30|publisher=AmphibiaWeb|year=2004}}</ref>

==Taxonomy==
This species is almost identical physiologically to [[Lesueur's frog]] (''Litoria lesueuri''), and is identical physiologically to ''[[Litoria jungguy|L. jungguy]]''. It can be distinguished from Lesueur's frog by the presence of blue spots on the thigh, which are missing in ''L. wilcoxii''. Geographical distribution and genetic testing are the only methods of differentiating ''L. wilcoxii'' from ''L. jungguy''.
