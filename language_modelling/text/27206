'''Umberto Eco''' (born [[January 5]], [[1932]]) is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[medievalist]], [[Semiotics|semiotician]], [[philosopher]] and [[novelist]], best known for his novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' ''(Il nome della rosa)'' and his many essays. 

==Biography==
Eco was born in the city of [[Alessandria]] in the region of [[Piedmont]].
His father, Giulio, was an accountant before the government called upon him to serve in three wars. During World War II, Umberto and his mother, Giovanna, moved to a small village in the Piedmontese mountainside.  Eco received a [[Salesian]] education, and he has made references to the order and its founder in his works and interviews.<ref>[www.sdb.ph/sdb4/N7/20040644ENG.doc Don Bosco in Umberto Eco<U+2019>s latest book] N7: News publication for the salesian community p.4 June 2004</ref> 

His family name is supposedly an acronym of ''ex caelis oblatus'' (lat: a gift from the heavens), which was given to his grandfather (a [[Child abandonment|foundling]]) by a city official.[http://www.themodernword.com/eco/eco_biography.html]

His father was the son of a family with thirteen children, and urged him to become a lawyer, but he entered the [[University of Turin]] in order to take up medieval philosophy and literature, writing his thesis on [[Thomas Aquinas]] and earning his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in philosophy in 1954. During this time, Eco left the [[Roman Catholic Church]] after a crisis of faith.[http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/ueco.htm] 

After this, Eco worked as a cultural editor for the state broadcasting station [[RAI|Radiotelevisione Italiana]] (RAI) and also lectured at the University of Turin (1956&ndash;64). A group of [[avant-garde]] artists<U+2014>painters, musicians, writers<U+2014>whom he had befriended at RAI became an important and influential component in Eco's future writing career. This was especially true after the publication of his first book in [[1956]], ''Il problema estetico di San Tommaso'', which was an extension of his doctoral thesis. This also marked the beginning of his lecturing career at his alma mater.

In September 1962, he married Renate Ramge, a [[German people|German]] art teacher.

==Works==
In [[1959]], he published his second book, ''Sviluppo dell'estetica medievale'', which established Eco as a formidable thinker in medievalism and proved his literary worth to his father. After serving for 18 months in the Italian Army, he left RAI to become, in 1959, non-fiction senior editor of [[Casa Editrice Bompiani]] of [[Milan]], a position he would hold until [[1975]].

Eco's work on [[Middle Ages|medieval]] aesthetics stressed the distinction between theory and practice. About the Middle Ages, he wrote, there was "a geometrically rational schema of what beauty ought to be, and on the other [hand] the unmediated life of art with its dialectic of forms and intentions" &mdash; the two cut off from one another as if by a pane of glass. Eco's work in [[literary theory]] has changed focus over time.  Initially, he was one of the pioneers of "[[Reader Response]]".  

During these years, Eco began seriously developing his ideas on the "open" text and on [[semiotics]], penning many essays on these subjects, and in 1962 he published ''Opera aperta'' ("Open Work").

In ''Opera aperta'', Eco argued that literary texts are fields of meaning, rather than strings of meaning, that they are understood as open, internally dynamic and psychologically engaged fields.  Those works of literature that limit potential understanding to a single, unequivocal line are the least rewarding, while those that are most open, most active between mind and society and line, are the most lively and best &mdash; although valuation terminology is not his business.  Eco emphasizes the fact that words do not have meanings that are simply lexical, but rather operate in the context of utterance.  So much had been said by [[I. A. Richards]] and others, but Eco draws out the implications for literature from this idea.  He also extended the axis of meaning from the continually deferred meanings of words in an utterance to a play between expectation and fulfillment of meaning.  Eco comes to these positions through study of language and from semiotics, rather than from psychology or historical analysis (as did theorists such as [[Wolfgang Iser]], on the one hand, and [[Hans-Robert Jauss]], on the other). He has also influenced [[popular culture studies]] though he did not develop a full-scale theory in this field.

==Action in Anthropology==

{{cleanup-section|April 2007}}

Founded by Umberto Eco, et al in 1971, '''Versus: Quaderni di studi semiotici''' (VS in Italian academic jargon) is an influential semiotic journal in Italy that has been an important confrontation space for a large number of scholars of several fields coping with signs and signification. Its foundation and activities have contributed to consolidate the perception of semiotics as an academic field in its own right both in Italy and in Europe.

Versus has published original articles by most influential European semioticians, including Umberto Eco, [[A.J. Greimas]], [[Jean-Marie Floch]], [[Paolo Fabbri]], [[:fr:Jacques Fontanille]], [[:fr:Claude Zilberberg]], [[:it:Ugo Volli]] and [[Patrizia Violi]]. At the same time, almost every issue also contains articles by younger, less famous semioticians dealing with new research perspectives in semiotics.  In 1988, at the University of Bologna, Eco created an unusual program of anthropology of the West by non-Westerners (African and Chinese scholars, as defined by their own criteria), the [[Transcultura]] international network based on an idea earlier developed by [[Alain Le Pichon]] in West Africa. This program resulted in a first conference in Guangzhou, China, in 1991 on "Frontiers of Knowledge", followed by an Itinerant Euro-Chinese seminar on "Misunderstandings in the Quest for the Universal", along the silk trade route from Canton to Beijing, culminating in a book, "The Unicorn and the Dragon", where scholars from China (in particular [[:ch:TANG Yijie]], [[:ch:WANG Bin]] and [[:ch:YUE Dayun]]), as well as from Europe ([[:it:Furio Colombo]], [[Antoine Danchin]], [[Jacques Le Goff]], [[Paolo Fabbri]], [[:fr:Alain Rey]]...) discussed the question of the creation of knowledge in China and in Europe. In 2000 a seminar in [[Timbuktoo]] (Mali), followed by a reflection on the conditions of reciprocal knowledge in Bologna gave rise to a series of conferences in Europe (Brussels and Paris) and in India (Goa), which led to a conference in Beijing in 2007 on Order and Disorder, New concepts of War and Peace, Human and Rights, and Social Justice and Harmony, where Eco presented the opening lecture, followed by anthropologists from India ([[:in:Balveer Arora]], [[Varun Sahni]], [[Rukmini Bhaya Nair]]), from Africa ([[Moussa Sow]]), from Europe ([[Roland Marti]], [[:fr:Maurice Olender]]) and from Korea ([[CHA Insuk]]), China ([[:ch:HUANG Ping]], [[ZHAO Tinyang]]), as well as scholars from the domain of law or science ([[Antoine Danchin]], [[Ahmed Djebbar]], [[:de:Dieter Grimm]]).

This non conventional interest for an investigation of the West by non-Westerners can be seen to match the interest of Eco for the international auxiliary language [[Esperanto]].

==Novels==
Eco's fiction has enjoyed a wide audience around the world, with good sales and many translations. His novels often include references to arcane historical figures and texts and his dense, intricate plots tend to take dizzying turns.

Eco employed his education as a medievalist in his novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', a historical mystery set in a [[14th century]] monastery.  Franciscan friar [[William of Baskerville]], aided by his assistant Adso, a Benedictine novice, investigates a series of murders at a monastery that is set to host an important religious debate. Eco is particularly good at translating medieval religious controversies and [[heresies]] into modern political and economic terms so that the reader can appreciate their substance without being a theologian.  ''The Name of the Rose'' was later made into [[The Name of the Rose (film)|a motion picture]] starring [[Sean Connery]], [[F. Murray Abraham]] and [[Christian Slater]].

''[[Foucault's Pendulum (book)|Foucault's Pendulum]]'', Eco's second novel, has also sold well.  In ''Foucault's Pendulum'', three under-employed editors who work for a minor publishing house decide to amuse themselves by inventing a conspiracy theory.  Their conspiracy, which they call "The Plan", is about an immense and intricate plot to take over the world by a secret order descended from the [[Knights Templar]].  As the game goes on, the three slowly become obsessed with the details of this plan.  The game turns dangerous when outsiders learn of The Plan, and believe that the men have really discovered the secret to regaining the lost treasure of the Templars.

Eco's work illustrates the [[postmodernist]] concept of [[intertextuality]], or the inter-connectedness of all literary works. His novels are full of subtle, often multilingual, references to literature and history.  For instance, the character [[William of Baskerville]] is a logically-minded Englishman who is a monk and a detective, and his name evokes both [[William of Ockham]] and [[Sherlock Holmes]] (by way of ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'').  Eco cites [[James Joyce]] and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] as the two modern authors who have influenced his work the most (Source: 'On Literature').
