The '''Gambian National Army''' numbers about 2,500. A new batch of 620 recruits have recently joined. Recruits receive training from the Turkish-Gambian Training Team.

The army consists of infantry battalions, the national guard, and the navy, all under the authority of the Department of State for Defence (a ministerial portfolio held by President Jammeh). Prior to the 1994 coup, the Gambian army received technical assistance and training from the [[United States]], [[People's Republic of China]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Turkey]]. With the withdrawal of most of this aid, the army has received renewed assistance from [[Turkey]], [[Pakistan]] and Taiwan and new assistance from [[Libya]] and others. Pakistan sent an 18-month advisory team (the Pakistan Armed Forces Advisory Mission, or PAFAM) composed of 1 brigadier, 1 naval captain and 1 group captain from the PAF.

Members of the Gambian military have participated in [[ECOMOG]], the West African force deployed during the Liberian civil war beginning in 1990. Responsibilities for internal security and law enforcement rest with the Gambian police/gendarme force under the inspector general of police and the ministry of the interior.

All branches are jointly governed by a chief of defence staff, Lieutenant General Massaneh Kinteh, who succeeded Lieutenant General [[Lang Tombong Tamba]] who is currently on death row for involvement in a 2009 coup plot.

===Army===
{{unsourced-section|date=May 2012}}
Strength has been estimated at about ~1,600. The Gambia National Army (GNA) has been an infantry force of two battalions, together with an engineering squadron and logistics, signals and intelligence units, plus the presidential guard company.<ref>Jane's World ARmies, 2011</ref> The latter has upgraded its equipment to provide greater firepower and mobility. It now has several armoured cars (two of which are based at State House) and heavier calibre vehicle-mounted weapons. It is not clear to which branches of the Gambian Armed Forces (GAF) new recruits are deployed. An amendment to The Gambia Armed Forces Bill in April 2008 included the creation of three new special units to expand the GAF: the republican guards, the national guards and special forces. There is also an HIV/AIDS prevention programme unit within the GAF.

It should be noted that the numbers in these units are small. The presidential guard company is probably a large platoon of about 50 and the infantry companies almost certainly number less than 100 personnel each armed with light weapons. Army service is voluntary.
