==Early life and education==
Padman was born Russell Padman, in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], in 1954, and attended [[Melbourne High School (Victoria)|Melbourne High School]] in the Melbourne suburb of [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]]. She was the school [[cadet]] captain and won the rifle-shooting prize for two consecutive years. She obtained first degree in Electrical Engineering from Monash University in Australia. She joined research work on radio astronomy at the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] Division of Radio Physics in [[Sydney]], for two years.<ref>{{cite web|last=Legge|first=Kate|title=Sex changes a school of thought|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/sex-changes-a-school-of-thought/story-e6frg6z6-1226227729945|work=The Australian|accessdate=6 March 2014|date=26 December 2011}}</ref> 

In her autobiographical essay, ''Rachael's Story'', she discussed her lifelong [[gender identity]] as female, and one motive of her going to England was a hope for an opportunity to address her gender issues.<ref>[http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TSsuccesses/RachaelPadman.html Rachael's Story (autobiographical essay)]</ref> In 1977 she went to England to work for PhD in astronomy at an all-male [[St John's College, Cambridge]], and did research at [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in University of Cambridge. Among the first things she did on arrival in Cambridge was to approach John Randall at [[Charing Cross Hospital]] in London, who prescribed [[estrogen]]. In 1978, she [[Coming out|came out]] as [[transgender]], and started with her PhD supervisor, Richard Hills. She said ''Rachael'' spontaneously came up as name one morning.

She received her degree in 1982. She immediately went to US at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], as a Miller Research Fellow. After two years in 1984, she returned to Cavendish.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zagria|title=Rachael Padman (1954 - ) physicist.|work=A Gender Variance Who's Who|accessdate=6 March 2014|date=24 October 2008}}</ref>

==Career==
At Cavendish, Padman was appointed Deputy Project Scientist for the [[James Clerk Maxwell Telescope]] in [[Hawaii]] in 1984. She worked there for four years until she became a University Lecturer in the Department of Physics, University of Cambridge, in 1998. From 2005 she has been primarily involved in the administration of teaching in the Department of Physics. She is Director of Education in School of Physical Sciences. At Newnham she is both teaching physics and serves as Director of Studies in Natural Sciences.<ref name=guardian/>

She was publicly [[outed]] in the press in 1996, that resulted in a controversy that led to resignation a colleague. That year Padman was elected Fellow of Newnham College. The college was the only surviving all-women college under the University of Cambridge, and its statues allowed only female members in the institute. The Principal Dr Onora O'Neil knew that Padman had undergone a sex-change operation. A famed feminist [[Germaine Greer]], who was a member of the college's governing body, strongly opposed to the appointment as she claimed that Padman was still legally [[cismale]].<ref name="guardian"/><ref name="garner"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Mistiaen|first=Veronique|title=Can Cambridge's All-women College Survive The Change?|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-08-24/features/9708240082_1_all-women-college-single-sex-college-germaine-greer|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=7 March 2014|date=24 August 1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Baty|first=Phil|title=The essential guide to sexuality|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/the-essential-guide-to-sexuality/103547.article|work=TimesHigherEducation|publisher=TSL Education Ltd.|accessdate=7 March 2014|date=21 July 1997}}</ref> But Fellows at the Cambridge University, and students and staff of the college supported the college and Padman, and she was admitted without further opposition.<ref name=garner/><ref name=featherstone/> Clare Longrigg published an article titled "A Sister with No Fellow Feeling" in 25 June 1997 issue of ''[[The Guardian]]'' making charges on Padman and contained uncompromising remarks from Greer.

Padman was quite content on [[Jenny Bailey]], and her partner Jennifer Liddle, becoming Mayor and Mayoress of Cambridge in 2007, the first transgender people in such positions.<ref>{{cite web|title=First sex-swap mayor is sworn in|accessdate=7 March 2014|publisher=BBC|date=24 May 2007}}</ref> She commented: "It's wonderful to see that it's possible and it doesn't bother people.
