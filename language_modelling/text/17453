'''Alpha Kappa Alpha''' ('''<U+0391><U+039A><U+0391>''') is the first [[Greek alphabet|Greek-lettered]] [[sorority]] established and incorporated by [[African-American]] college women. The sorority was founded on January 15, 1908, at [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], by a group of nine students, led by [[Ethel Hedgeman Lyle]]. Forming a sorority broke barriers for African-American women in areas where little power or authority existed due to a lack of opportunities for minorities and women in the early 20th century.<ref>Tamara L. Brown, Gregory Parks, Clarenda M. Phillips, ''African American Fraternities and Sororities: The Legacy and the Vision''. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2005. p. 342</ref> Alpha Kappa Alpha was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] on January 29, 1913.

Consisting of college-educated women of many diverse backgrounds from around the world, including, but not limited to, [[Black race|African]], [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]], [[Asian people|Asian]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], [[Hispanic]] and [[India]]n descent, the sorority serves through a membership of more than 250,000 women in over 900 chapters in the United States and several other countries.<ref name=AKAmember/> Women may join through undergraduate chapters at a college or university or they may also join through a graduate chapter after acquiring  an undergraduate or advanced college degree.<ref name=AKAint>{{cite web |year=2006 |url=http://www.akainternational.org/main/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=26&Itemid=34    |title=Historical Overview|publisher=Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated.&nbsp;<U+2013> International Region|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref>

After the organization's establishment over a century ago, Alpha Kappa Alpha has helped to improve social and economic conditions through community service programs. Members have improved education through independent initiatives, contributed to community-building by creating programs and associations, such as the Mississippi Health Clinic, and influenced federal legislation by [[U.S. Congress|Congressional]] lobbying through the National Non-Partisan Lobby on Civil and Democratic Rights. The sorority works with communities through service initiatives and progressive programs relating to education, family, health, and business.

Alpha Kappa Alpha is part of the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]] (NPHC). The current International President is Carolyn House Stewart, and the sorority's document and pictorial archives are located at [[Moorland-Spingarn Research Center]].

===Beginnings: 1907<U+2013>1912===
In spring 1907, Ethel Hedgeman led efforts to create a sisterhood at Howard University. Howard faculty member Ethal Robinson encouraged Hedgeman by relating her own recollections of sorority life at the Women's College at [[Brown University]].<ref name="Ross-166">Ross, Jr., ''The Divine Nine'', p. 166.</ref><ref name="delta">{{cite book

<ref name=quander>{{cite web |url=http://www.thequanderquality.com/nellie2.htm |title=Nellie Quander, Page Two |publisher=The Quander Quality|accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref> Alpha Kappa Alpha continued to grow at Howard. By the end of the 1911<U+2013>1912 school year, there were more than twenty members of the sorority and the organization had become an influential part of student life at Howard.<ref>McNealey, E., ''Pearls of Service''.</ref>  
However, following the annual celebration known as "Ivy Day" on the campus of Howard University in the spring of 1912, founder and former Basileus, Nellie Quander came to the realization that seven neophytes (not the young ladies who had been accepted without initiation), along with several other newly initiated members of the sorority elected to make fundamental changes to the colors, letters, and constitution and to make the sorority more active outside the walls of Howard University. These women, twenty-two in total, claimed that they wanted to make the sorority "more" and that they wished for the organization to have a greater impact beyond the walls of Howard University. On January 13, 1913, the twenty-two women of the entire undergraduate chapter voted to transform the original Alpha Kappa Alpha into [[Delta Sigma Theta]] Sorority. The founders, among others, disagreed with their position. The organization was only four years old, and had already gained a formidable reputation on campus. Nellie Quander was steadfast in her efforts to maintain the integrity and tenets upon which Alpha Kappa Alpha was founded. She, along with the women who had become <U+0391><U+039A><U+0391>'s during the four years of the sorority's existence, and had now graduated, elected to remain Alpha Kappa Alpha. Nellie Quander set up a three person committee that successfully petitioned to incorporate <U+0391><U+039A><U+0391> as a perpetual entity. Alpha Kappa Alpha was nationally incorporated on January 29, 1913.

===Lawsuits, Forensic Audits, and IRS Review of Former President===
On June 20, 2009, eight Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority members filed a complaint in D.C. Superior Court demanding that International President Barbara McKinzie be fired for improper use of sorority funds and the money be returned to the sorority.<ref>{{cite news|first=James|last=Wright|title=AKA Battles Internal Discord|date=2009-08-13|publisher=New Journal and Guide|url=http://www.njournalg.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=149:aka-battles-internal-discord&catid=41:national-news&Itemid=74|work=The New Journal & Guide Online|accessdate=2009-08-19}}</ref> The lawsuit claims that Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated's Executive Board approved the spending of thousands of dollars on McKinzie's costs of living, including commissioning an expensive wax model of McKinzie. In response, McKinzie denied the allegations, referring to them as "without merit."<ref>"Members sue AKA president, cite $900K wax statue", ''Chicago Sun Times'', July 29, 2009.</ref> [http://www.friendsoftheweepingivy.com/PDF/PinkGreenVsBAM.pdf]  Also see the Shackleford Letter [http://www.friendsoftheweepingivy.com/PDF/Shackelford_Letter.pdf] 

In February 2010, Natalia M. Combs Greene, associate judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, dismissed the lawsuit, stating that it contained "hyperbolic allegations riddled with buzz words." She wrote, "This case is largely about several disgruntled <U+0391><U+039A><U+0391> members disillusioned with what they see as an increasingly opaque, authoritarian and self-serving leadership in their organization....The question remains, however, whether such behavior warrants judicial intervention." The judge also maintained the plaintiffs had "overwhelmed the record with seemingly unnecessary and frivolous exhibits, arguments, counts and facts detailing the sorority's 101-year history," and that many of the plaintiff's arguments "read as political speeches."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/03/AR2010020302370.html Judge dismisses suit against oldest black sorority]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://washington.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2010/02/01/daily31.html Alpha Kappa Alpha lawsuit dismissed]</ref>

On August 18, 2011, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals reversed the previous decision to dismiss the lawsuit citing, "On appeal, appellants argue that the trial court improperly concluded that (1) the court did not have jurisdiction over the individual appellees, (2)appellants, with one exception, lacked standing to bring their suit, and (3) appellants failed to state any cognizable claim against the sorority. We agree that the trial court improperly dismissed on these grounds and that the case must be remanded for further proceedings. In all other respects, the dismissal is reversed and
the case remanded for further proceedings." <ref>[http://www.friendsoftheweepingivy.com/PDF/Appeal%20Decision%2010-CV-220_MTD%5B1%5D.pdf%208%2018%202011.pdf]</ref> [http://www.fileden.com/files/2007/7/31/1311456//AKAReversal.pdf]

On March 22, 2012, a forensic audit of Alpha Kappa Alpha's 2010 financial records revealed troubling concerns with past president, Barbara McKinzie's development and access to a "secret" bank account. A financial audit of the nation<U+2019>s oldest black sorority found significant accounting problems including a secret set of books used by top officials to divert money, findings that bolster the claims in the previous lawsuit. The audit of the Chicago-based Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, which was completed in December 2011 and provided to The Associated Press, also found two former top officials continued to use sorority credit cards after their service ended, failing to appropriately document tens of thousands of dollars in charges. A pending 2009 lawsuit against the organization and officials including its former president, Illinois resident Barbara McKinzie, contains similar allegations. The audit by the Illinois-based accounting firm Ragland & Associates covers the year 2010 and is an annual audit paid for by the society. It finds that in that year McKinzie and two other top officials secretly created a second set of financial books to get around the sorority<U+2019>s accounting policies. According to the audit, "Nearly $1.7 million in payments were made to the former president, Barbara McKinie, without authorization. Approximately $282,000 in credit card charges on a second set of books appear to be fraudulent, including personal charges the sorority wasn<U+2019>t reimbursed for."<ref>[http://www.fileden.com/files/2007/7/31/1311456/Audit.pdf]</ref> [http://www.fileden.com/files/2007/7/31/1311456/Audit.pdf]

Alpha Kappa Alpha's tax returns for years 2007 through 2009 are being audited by the Internal Revenue Service.  The audit is in process and is expected to be concluded sometime in January 2012.  The areas in which they are auditing are in the post Boule expenses, unrelated business income, regional directors office expenses (non-accountable plan expenses), set-aside income that has been authorized by the board, and travel and entertainment not supported with documents, including the American Express credit card expenses."

====History and donations====
The foundation was the brainchild of Constance Holland, the sister of former Alpha Kappa Alpha International President Dr. Barbara Phillips, in 1978.  The foundation had official beginnings in 1980 and the sorority donated US$10,000 for the project. Eight years later, the organization first awarded $10,000 to fourteen students.  In 1991, EAF first awarded mini-grants to community organizations.  In 1998, EAF provided the first Youth Partners Accessing Capital (P.A.C.) award to an undergraduate member.

At the organization's twentieth anniversary in 2000, EAF published ''Perpetuating Our Posterity: A Blueprint for Excellence.'' The book served as a comprehensive history of the organization and as a source of advice for other beginning philanthropies. EAF went online with a [[website]] in 2003.

The organization celebrated a silver anniversary in [[Nassau, Bahamas]], in 2005. EAF is incorporated into International President Barbara A. McKinzie's centennial program for funding under '''E'''xcellent '''S'''cholarly '''P'''erformance.  Overall, EAF has donated more than $200,000 in grants and awarded 1,400 students with scholarships.<ref name=AKAEAF>{{cite web |url=http://aka1908.com/eaf/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080621150132/http://www.aka1908.com/eaf/ |archivedate=2008-06-21|title=Making a Difference&nbsp;<U+2014> Educational Advancement Foundation|publisher=Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated|accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref> Other major donors to EAF include [[Continental Airlines]] and [[Northern Trust]].<ref name=donorsEAF>{{cite web |url=http://www.akaeaf.org/donors/|title=Donors&nbsp;<U+2014> Educational Advancement Foundation|publisher=Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated&nbsp;<U+2014> Educational Advancement Foundation|accessdate=2007-05-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070621154831/http://www.akaeaf.org/donors/| archivedate= 21 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===P.I.M.S. (Partnerships in Mathematics and Science)===
Partnerships in Mathematics and Science (P.I.M.S.) began in Eva Evans's administration in 1994, and was a part of the S.P.I.R.I.T. program during the [[Linda White]] administration.<ref name="mcnealey152">McNealey, E., ''Pearls of Service'', p. 152.</ref> Eva Evans mentioned the need for a math and science program, "As a college sorority, we've always advanced an educational agenda. We always had high GPA requirements.  And more than ever, we're pushing the importance of math and science for our girls.  We need more black women in those fields."<ref name="log2">Graham, L., ''Our Kind of People'', p. 91.</ref> The program's purpose is to increase the successes of youth in mathematics and science, as well as technology. Campaigns to highlight the program's importance were sponsored by the [[National Science Foundation]] and historically black colleges from across the country.<ref name="mcnealey152"/> Several chapters provided two-week math and science summer camps on college and day school campuses, which consisted of hands-on-learning through laboratory interactions, field trips to important sites, youth camps, and speeches from influential experts in specific areas of studies.<ref name=programs/><ref name="McNealey153"/> For example, a P.I.M.S. program at Park Street Elementary School in [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], consisted of third through fifth grade girls and provided educational field trips in order to stimulate involvement in math and science.<ref name=NI/><ref name=marietta>{{cite web |url=http://www.marietta-city.k12.ga.us/parkstreet/html/ourschool.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070812152652/http://www.marietta-city.k12.ga.us/parkstreet/html/ourschool.htm |archivedate=2007-08-12

===Young Authors Program===
In Linda White's administrations, the Young Authors Program was born.  The purpose of the program is to encourage and raise involvement in reading and writing in kindergarten through third grade school children.
