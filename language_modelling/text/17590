==Plot summary==
{{spoiler}}
''Little Miss Sunshine'' is the story of the Hoovers, a remarkably [[dysfunctional family]] from [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. The film begins as Sheryl ([[Toni Collette]]) picks up her brother Frank ([[Steve Carell]]) from the hospital and takes him to the Hoover home to help him recover from his failed [[suicide]] attempt. There the clashing and desperate personalities of each family member come into contrast as they eat dinner that evening. The father of the Hoover family, Richard ([[Greg Kinnear]]), is a manic go-getter striving to find a way to sell his [[Motivational speaker|motivational]] nine-step technique to becoming a winner. His wife Sheryl, though reasonable and understanding, is constantly on the edge of her wits as Richard pushes his techniques on their children and spends family earnings to finance his program. Early on, Frank forms a distaste for Richard and bonds more with Dwayne ([[Paul Dano]]), the silent, angst-ridden, [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]-reading teenage son of the Hoover family. Dwayne has not spoken for nine months. Instead, he shakes his head or motions with his arms during conversation. When he cannot accurately convey a thought with these methods, he uses a notepad and a pen to write down his thoughts for others. Richard explains that he has taken a vow of silence and refuses to speak until he is accepted to the Air Force Academy as he wants to be a test pilot for the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]].

Richard's father, Edwin, ([[Alan Arkin]]), usually referred to as "Dad" or "Grandpa", speaks his thoughts loudly and frankly. He recently moved into the Hoover household after being kicked out of his retirement home for snorting [[heroin]]. Grandpa has since formed a strong bond with seven-year-old granddaughter, Olive ([[Abigail Breslin]]), and coaches her to perform in a [[beauty contest|beauty pageant]].

During dinner, the family members bicker and argue over a number of subjects, not the least of which is Frank. Olive asks Frank how he hurt his arms. Despite Richard's objections, Frank explains that he was once a highly regarded professor of the writings of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], but had gotten entangled in an unrequited homosexual love affair with a student which eventually resulted in Frank losing his job and apartment.

As dinner ends, Richard remembers to tell Olive about an answering machine message he received about the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Olive runs to the answering machine and learns that she has qualified for the contest's finals that are being held in [[Redondo Beach, California]] in two days. After Richard and Sheryl attempt to haphazardly concoct plans for getting Olive to the pageant, they finally decide that they have no choice but to pack all six family members into their yellow [[Volkswagen Type 2]] mini-bus for a two-day road trip.

Soon after they begin the trip, the [[clutch]] on the mini-bus breaks. A repairman reports that it cannot be fixed that day because he would have to order the parts.  However, he explains that they do not really need a clutch if they park on an incline so the mini-bus can get a moving start (or push the bus until it gets into gear).  Several times in the movie, the family members all get out to push the vehicle and then run frantically to get back in the side door as the mini-bus picks up speed.

The long journey from New Mexico to California is not without incident, as all characters [[Character development|develop]] along the way. Richard incessantly calls a business contact who promises to introduce his nine-step program to the world through a book, and possibly DVDs and other media. When he finally gets in touch with the business contact, Richard gets the bad news: no publishing houses want the book. Frank has a chance encounter at a gas station with the graduate student he fell in love with, and they have a short and awkward conversation while Frank tries to keep his wrists hidden; this meeting feeds Frank's depression. Olive starts to worry about her looks and weight after Richard warns her that [[ice cream]] is not a food that [[beauty contest]]ants usually eat because of their weight concerns. The rest of the family refutes Richard's claims and start eating ice cream to encourage Olive to do the same. Olive keeps her confidence thanks to Grandpa, who assures her that she is beautiful. Grandpa spends the beginning of the trip being a foul-mouthed nuisance, but tries to comfort his son after his business deal goes sour, emphasising how proud he is of his son taking a chance. At the end of the first and particularly difficult day of travel, Richard leaves his hotel room alone and travels to [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] on a scooter where he meets his business contact (played by [[Bryan Cranston]]), who once again confirms the bad news, saying that Richard's non-existent stature in the business world is the reason no one is interested in his book. Sheryl is incensed that Richard has made promises of an advance that they will not be getting. After he puts Olive to bed, Grandpa snorts [[heroin]], overdoses, and then dies in his sleep.

In the hospital, Sheryl has a [[breakdown]] and tells her family that what is most important in life is each other. The family is told by hospital staff of the various procedures they must take care of in dealing with Grandpa's passing, and that these things will take several hours to complete. Richard, upset at his father and trying to re-energize his own motivation, refuses to miss the pageant. With the help of other family members, Richard manages to push his father's dead body out the window and get it into the car, so the family can leave immediately, with Grandpa's body in the van's trunk.  

As they near their destination, the van's horn gets jammed and continually makes strange and humorous noises, at one point attracting the attention of a police officer. The police officer is so preoccupied with the hardcore [[pornographic magazine|porno]] magazines he finds in the trunk that he does not notice the dead body of Grandpa,. After resuming the trip, Dwayne fails an [[Ishihara color test|optical test for colorblindness]] and comes to the realization that this vision defect will prevent him from becoming an [[US Air Force|Air Force]] pilot. At the side of a road, he runs out of the van and has a [[nervous breakdown|breakdown]] of his own, in which he breaks his vow of silence. Consolation from family members is ineffective until Olive, saying nothing, tenderly hugs him. Dwayne gets back in the van and the race is on to make the pageant.

Running late, Richard drives the van through shrubs and small barricades to make it to the hotel, and Frank bolts from the van and makes it to the event to meet the contest coordinators and get Olive entered. Olive runs inside, but arrives a few minutes past the deadline. Fortunately, the event's A/V technician, out of spite toward the contest coordinator in charge (played by [[Beth Grant]]), enters Olive anyway. As Olive gets dressed and prepares, she and her family start to notice that all the other contestants are dolled-up little girls in excessive make-up, extreme hairdos and lavishly "sexy" costumes. Meanwhile, Richard calls a funeral home to remove his father's body, saying that Grandpa died while taking a nap in the van.

Outside, Dwayne contemplates life while talking with Frank on the beach. Dwayne remarks that the first 18 years of life are full of suffering, and are better off not experienced. Frank, citing Proust, says that the years of suffering in life are the years where we grow and learn. By indirectly saying Nietzsche's phrase, "Whatever does not kill you makes you stronger," Dwayne seems to come out of his long funk.

Inside the hotel, Olive contrasts with the other contestants in the pageant, whose doll-like, "sexy" looks and slick choreography are very different from her own more natural and awkward looks and moves. The final part of the contest - the talent competition - is next and Olive says that she's ready to do the dance steps Grandpa taught her. Richard and Dwayne agree that she should not go onstage, as she will only embarrass herself and see the audience laugh at her. Sheryl refuses to tell Olive what to do and lets Olive finish the pageant. When Olive appears onstage, the song "[[Superfreak]]" comes on and Olive begins a roughly choreographed stripper's dance.  In contrast to the implied sexual innuendo of the other little girls' performances, her own is frankly and humorously sexual, like her grandfather's conversations. She even rips off her tearaway trousers and throws them into the audience. Everyone watching is taken aback, including, at first, Olive's family. After overcoming their shock, the family cheers Olive on, and Miss California, who is one of the judges, seems to enjoy it; the A/V technician is supportive as well. The event administrators and the other judges are horrified and try to stop the music, but the A/V technician does not comply. The event host then tries to nudge Olive off the dance floor mid-routine but he is tackled by Richard. After the scuffle ends, Richard goes onstage to tell Olive her act is over, but suddenly decides to buck the event organizers and ends up dancing with Olive - doing the same funny moves to "Superfreak"; each member of the family eventually runs onstage to do the same. There is a joyful scene of the whole family dancing together exuberantly.

The family members are all spared jail time and charges if they swear to never enter Olive into another beauty pageant in [[California]] again. Leaving, they all seem to have bonded. They push the van again, hop in, break through the parking lot gate and leave for New Mexico.

==Trivia==
[[Image:Ewlms.jpg|[[Greg Kinnear]], [[Abigail Breslin]], and [[Steve Carell]] featured on the [[August 11]], [[2006]] cover of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.|thumb]]
* Originally written as an East Coast roadtrip movie from [[Maryland]] to [[Florida]], it was shifted to a journey from [[New Mexico]] to [[California]] due to shooting issues.
* The role of the suicidal uncle was originally written for [[Bill Murray]], the studios wanted [[Robin Williams]], but eventually went for [[Steve Carell]].
* Five identical [[Volkswagen Type 2]]s were used during filming.
* The movie was shot in sequence.
* Uncle Frank's full name was not mentioned in the film, but at the beginning, the name "Dr. Greenburg" can be seen on his hospital door.
* The script was purchased from first time screenwriter [[Michael Arndt]] for $250,000.
* No filming was done in New Mexico; the Albuquerque scenes were actually shot in southern California. This explains why the family eats take-out chicken in a bucket from Dinah's Family Restaurant, located in Los Angeles.
* In another dining scene, the family looks at menus from Pann's, a well-known family restaurant not far from [[Los Angeles International Airport]]. However, the scene actually was shot in another restaurant.
* The scenes that took place in [[Redondo Beach, California]] were actually filmed in [[Ventura, California]]. There are no freeways that lead to the beach.
* Many of the freeway scenes were filmed on [[California State Route 14]].
* The scene in the gas station was filmed in the [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] station on Lyons Road in [[Santa Clarita, California]].
* Although known to [[Comedy Central]] viewers for many years as a correspondent on the high-rated satirical news program ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', [[Steve Carell]], at the time he was cast for ''Little Miss Sunshine'', was a relative unknown in Hollywood. According to an article in ''Entertainment Weekly'',<ref>[[Entertainment Weekly]], [http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,1222576-4-4_1||233612|1_,00.html ''"Why everyone's buzzing about 'Little Miss Sunshine'"'']August 3, 2006. Retrieved Nov. 18, 2006.</ref> the producers of the film worried that he wasn't a big enough star and didn't have much acting experience. However, between the time the film was shot in the summer of 2005 and its release in the summer of 2006, Carell became a huge success as the star of the high-grossing film ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'' in [[August 2005]] and the [[Michael Scott (The Office)|leading character]] of the popular [[NBC]] [[Emmy]]-winning television series ''[[The Office (US TV series)|The Office]]'', which premiered in [[March 2005]] and for which Carell won a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] in [[2006]] for best lead actor in a comedy television series. In the span of just one year, Carell had become such a star that the producers had gone from protesting his casting to tapping him to do prominent promotion for the film.
* All the girls acting as participants in the beauty pageant, except [[Abigail Breslin]], were veterans of real beauty pageants. They looked the same and performed the same acts as they had in their real-life pageants.<ref>Kim Voynar, [http://www.efilmcritic.com/feature.php?feature=1897 ''"Interview with 'Little Miss Sunshine' Directors Valerie Faris & Jonathan Dayton"''], last updated 09/12/06.

* Greg Kinnear and Paul Dano also star in the 2006 movie adaptation of Eric Schlosser's ''[[Fast Food Nation (film)|Fast Food Nation]]''.
* On [[July 25]], 2006 Fox Searchlight Pictures invited VW bus owners to a screening of ''Little Miss Sunshine'' at [[Vineland Drive-In]] theater in [[City of Industry, California]]. 65 VW buses were present at the event.<ref>Fox Searchlight Pictures, [http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/littlemisssunshine/slideshow/ ''"Slide show"''], retrieved Nov. 18, 2006.</ref>
* The license plate of Frank's academic and romantic rival, Larry Sugarman (the #2 Proust scholar), reads "lost time", a reference to [[Marcel Proust]]'s principal novel ''<U+00C0> la recherche du temps perdu'' or ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''.
* Inside the convenience store, the price of Frank's slurpee and the pornographic magazines came to a total of $19.79. Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris had previously directed the "1979" music video by [[The Smashing Pumpkins]].
* [[Bryan Cranston]]'s character in ''Little Miss Sunshine'' has the same name - Stan Grossman - as Larry Brandenburg's character in the film ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]''.
* [[Paul Dano]]'s character has the same given name - Dwayne - as one of the main characters in the Kurt Vonnegut novel ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]''; in addition, the referenced main character has the family name "Hoover."
* A scene shot in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], as the family leaves the area for California, shows the family's bus traveling eastbound on the [[Arizona State Route 101]], crossing beneath the juncture of the [[Interstate 17]] freeway. In reality, they would be headed in the wrong direction.
