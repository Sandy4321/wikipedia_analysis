'''Hoye-Crest''' is a [[Summit (topography)|summit]] along [[Backbone Mountain]] just inside of [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett County]], [[Maryland]].  It is the highest point in Maryland at an elevation of {{convert|3360|ft}}.<ref name="SummitPost.org: Backbone Mountain">{{cite web|url=http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/152048/backbone-mountain.html|title=Backbone Mountain|publisher=SummitPost.org|accessdate=2008-06-02}}</ref>

The location, named for Captain Charles Hoye of the [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett County]] Historical Society, has a marker and offers a view of the [[North Branch Potomac River]] valley to the east.  The location is accessible via a path leading from [[U.S. Route 219]] to the west.

==Accessing Hoye-Crest==
There is no direct road access to [[Hoye-Crest]].  The best route is a hike in from a point along [[U.S. Route 219]] just south of [[Silver Lake, West Virginia|Silver Lake]], [[West Virginia]] at {{coord|39|14|43|N|79|29|30|W}}.  From here, you can begin ascending [[Backbone Mountain]] along an old road and hiking trail on [[Monongahela National Forest]] property that goes up to the [[West Virginia]]-[[Maryland]] state line.  From this point, you can head north along the state line.  Hoye-Crest itself sits on private property, although access is permitted.
