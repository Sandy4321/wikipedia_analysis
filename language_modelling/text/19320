'''''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''''' is the eighth [[studio album]] by the English [[Rock music|rock]] band [[the Beatles]]. Released on 1 June 1967, it was an immediate commercial and critical success, spending 22 weeks at the top of the albums chart in the UK and 15 weeks at number one in the US. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine declared it "a historic departure in the progress of music" and the ''[[New Statesman]]'' praised its elevation of [[pop music|pop]] to the level of fine art.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=697}} It won four [[Grammy Award]]s in 1968, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], the first rock [[LP record|LP]] to receive this honour.

In August 1966 the Beatles permanently retired from touring and began a three-month holiday from recording. During a return flight to [[London]] in November, [[Paul McCartney]] had an idea for a song involving an [[Edwardian era]] military band that would eventually form the impetus of the ''Sgt Pepper'' concept. Sessions for the Beatles' eighth studio album began on 24 November in [[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road Studio Two]], with the original intention to record an album of material that was to be thematically linked to their childhoods. Among the first tracks recorded for the project were "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]" and "[[Penny Lane]]", but after pressure from [[EMI]] the songs were released as a [[double A-side]] single; they were not included on the album.

In February 1967, after recording "[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]", McCartney suggested that the Beatles should release an entire album that would represent a performance by the fictional Sgt. Pepper band. This alter ego group would give them the freedom to experiment musically. During the recording sessions the band endeavoured to improve upon the production quality of their prior releases, adopting an experimental approach to composition, writing songs such as "[[With a Little Help from My Friends]]", "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]" and "[[A Day in the Life]]" knowing that they would not have to perform the tracks live. The producer [[George Martin]]'s innovative recording of the album included the liberal application of sound shaping [[signal processing]] and the use of a 40-piece orchestra performing [[Aleatoric music|aleatoric]] crescendos. Recording was completed on 21 April 1967. The cover, depicting the band posing in front of a collage of celebrities and historical figures, was designed by the English pop artists [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] and [[Jann Haworth]] based on a sketch by McCartney.
 
''Sgt. Pepper'' is regarded by musicologists as an early [[concept album]] that advanced the use of [[Cyclic form|extended form]] in popular music while continuing the artistic maturation seen on the Beatles' preceding releases. It has been described as one of the first [[art rock]] LPs, aiding the development of [[progressive rock]], and credited with marking the beginning of the [[Album Era]]. An important work of British [[psychedelia]], the multigenre album incorporates diverse stylistic influences, including [[vaudeville]], [[Circus music|circus]], [[music hall]], [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]], and [[Classical music|Western]] and [[Indian classical music]]. In 2003 the [[Library of Congress]] placed ''Sgt. Pepper'' in the [[National Recording Registry]], honouring the work as "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".<ref name="LoC2003"/> That same year ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked it number one in its list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]. As of 2014 it has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums worldwide|best selling albums of all time]]. The music scholar David Scott Kastan described it as "the most important and influential rock and roll album ever recorded".{{sfn|Kastan|2006|p=139}}

==Background==
{{quote box|quote= We were fed up with being the Beatles. We really hated that fucking four little mop-top approach. We were not boys, we were men&nbsp;... and thought of ourselves as artists rather than just performers.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=303}} |source=<U+2014>[[Paul McCartney]]|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

By 1966 [[the Beatles]] had grown weary of live performance.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=210}} In [[John Lennon]]'s opinion, they could "send out four waxworks&nbsp;... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites."{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=229}} In June, two days after finishing the album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'', the group set off for a tour that started in Germany.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=212}} While in [[Hamburg]] they received an anonymous telegram stating: "Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger".{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=7}} The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred [[Nippon Budokan]] arena.{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=7}} As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewisohn|1992|p=211}}; {{harvnb|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=7}}.</ref> The polite and restrained Japanese audiences shocked the band, because the absence of screaming fans allowed them to hear how poor their live performances had become. By the time that they arrived in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting the First Lady [[Imelda Marcos]], the group had grown unhappy with their manager, [[Brian Epstein]], for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=212<U+2013>213}} After their return to London [[George Harrison]] replied to a question about their long-term plans: "We'll take a couple of weeks to recuperate before we go and get beaten up by the Americans."{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=213}} His comments would prove prophetic, as soon afterwards Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being "[[more popular than Jesus]]" embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's [[Bible Belt]].{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=213}} A public apology eased tensions, but a miserable [[The Beatles' 1966 US tour|US tour in August]] that was marked by half-filled stadia and subpar performances proved to be their last.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewisohn|1992|pp=210: the Beatles grew tired of touring, 230: the Beatles' final commercial performance}}; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=213}}</ref> The author [[Nicholas Schaffner]] writes:

{{Quote|To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released ''Revolver'' LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|pp=58<U+2013>59}}}}

Upon the Beatles' return to England, rumours began to circulate that they had decided to break up.{{sfn|Julien|2008b|p=1}} Harrison informed Epstein that he was leaving the band, but was persuaded to stay on the assurance that there would be no more tours.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=213}} The group then took a seven-week holiday, during which they focused on individual interests. Harrison travelled to India for six weeks to develop his [[sitar]] playing under the instruction of [[Ravi Shankar]].{{sfn|Julien|2008b|p=2}} [[Paul McCartney]] and the producer [[George Martin]] collaborated on [[The Family Way (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] for the film ''[[The Family Way]]''.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=8}} Lennon acted in the film ''[[How I Won the War]]'' and attended art showings, such as one at the [[Indica Gallery]] where he met his future wife [[Yoko Ono]].{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=158, 160<U+2013>161}} [[Ringo Starr]] used the break to spend more time with his wife [[Maureen Starkey Tigrett|Maureen]] and son [[Zak Starkey|Zak]].<ref>{{harvnb|Harry|2000|pp=323, 333}}; {{harvnb|Julien|2008b|p=2}}.</ref>

==Concept and inspiration==
In November 1966, during a return flight to London from Kenya, where he had been on holiday with Beatles' [[tour manager]] [[Mal Evans]], McCartney had an idea for a song that eventually formed the impetus of the ''Sgt Pepper'' concept.{{sfn|Julien|2008b|p=2}} His idea involved an [[Edwardian era|Edwardian-era]] military band that Evans invented a name for in the style of contemporary [[San Francisco]]-based groups such as [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] and [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]].{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=168}} In February 1967 McCartney suggested that the Beatles should record an entire album that would represent a performance by the fictional band.{{sfn|Moore|1997|pp=20<U+2013>21}} This alter ego group would give them the freedom to experiment musically. He explained: "I thought, let's not be ourselves. Let's develop alter egos."{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=303<U+2013>304}} Martin remembered:

{{Quote|"Sergeant Pepper" itself didn't appear until halfway through making the album. It was Paul's song, just an ordinary rock number&nbsp;... but when we had finished it, Paul said, "Why don't we make the album as though the Pepper band really existed, as though Sergeant Pepper was making the record? We'll dub in effects and things." I loved the idea, and from that moment on it was as though ''Pepper'' had a life of its own.{{sfn|Martin|1994|p=202}}}}

In 1966, the American musician and bandleader [[Brian Wilson]]'s growing interest in the aesthetics of recording and his admiration for the Beatles' album ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' resulted in the [[the Beach Boys]]' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' [[LP record|LP]], which demonstrated his production expertise and his mastery of composition and arrangement.<ref>{{harvnb|MacFarlane|2008|pp=36<U+2013>37}}: Wilson's growing interest in the aesthetics of recording; {{harvnb|Kimsey|2009|p=235}}: Wilson's admiration for the Beatles' ''[[Rubber Soul]]''.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|During the early and mid-1960s, the American group the Beach Boys released music that displayed an increasing level of sophistication. Led by their principal songwriter and producer, Brian Wilson, they combined [[jazz]]-inspired [[vocal harmony]] with [[surf music]], creating their unique sound.{{sfn|MacFarlane|2008|p=36}} Wilson, writing the liner notes for ''Pet Sounds'', explained its inspiration: "In December 1965, I heard the album ''Rubber Soul''. It was definitely a challenge for me. I saw that every cut was very artistically interesting and stimulating. I immediately went to work on the songs for ''Pet Sounds''."{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=48}}}} The author Thomas MacFarlane credits the release with influencing many musicians of the time, with McCartney in particular singing its praises and drawing inspiration to "expand the focus of the Beatles' work with sounds and textures not usually associated with popular music."{{sfn|MacFarlane|2008|pp=36<U+2013>37}} He thought that his constant playing of the album made it difficult for Lennon to "escape the influence", adding: "It's very cleverly done&nbsp;... so we were inspired by it and nicked a few ideas."<ref>{{harvnb|Babiuk|2002|p=204}}: "It's very cleverly done"; {{harvnb|Julien|2008c|p=158}}: "escape the influence".</ref> Martin stated: "Without ''Pet Sounds'', ''Sgt.

==Recording and production==

[[File:Abbeyroadtomswain.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|alt=A colour image of a large room with a piano in the middle|[[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road Studio Two]], where nearly every track on ''Sgt. Pepper'' was recorded{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|pp=184, 190}}]]

According to the musicologist [[Walter Everett (musicologist)|Walter Everett]], ''Sgt. Pepper'' marks the beginning of McCartney's ascendancy as the Beatles' dominant creative force. He wrote more than half of the album's material while asserting increasing control over the recording of his compositions. He would from this point on provide the artistic direction for the group's releases.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=99}}{{refn|group=nb|In Emerick's opinion, the recording of ''Sgt. Pepper'' marks the emergence of McCartney as the Beatles' ''de facto'' producer, as Martin was increasingly absent near the end of late-night sessions that often lasted until dawn.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=163}} Emerick contends that <U+2013> by the time of the ''Sgt. Pepper'' sessions <U+2013> "it was evident that John's personality was changing. Instead of being opinionated about everything, he was becoming complacent; in fact, he seemed quite content to have someone else do his thinking for him."{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=174}}}} Sessions began on 24 November 1966 in [[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road Studio Two]], the first time that the Beatles had come together since September.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=232}} Afforded the luxury of a nearly limitless recording budget, they booked open-ended sessions that allowed them to work as late as they wanted.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=215}}{{refn|group=nb|[[EMI]] owned the Beatles' recordings and [[Abbey Road Studios]], so they did not deduct fees for studio time from the band's royalty payments during the recording and production of ''Sgt. Pepper''.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=215}}}} They began with three songs that they intended to issue on an album of material that would be thematically linked to their childhoods: "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]", "[[When I'm Sixty-Four]]" and "[[Penny Lane]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Everett|1999|p=99}}; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=212<U+2013>223}}.</ref> The first session saw the introduction of a new keyboard instrument called the [[Mellotron]], acquired by Lennon, its keys triggered one of three [[tape loops]] for flutes, strings or choirs, enabling its user to play in those three voices. McCartney performed the introduction to "Strawberry Fields Forever" using the flute setting.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|pp=135<U+2013>136}} The track's complicated production involved the innovative splicing of two takes that were recorded in different [[tempo]]s and [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]es.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=217<U+2013>220}} The [[EMI]] [[audio engineer]], [[Geoff Emerick]], remembers that during the recording of ''Revolver'', "we had gotten used to being asked to do the impossible, and we knew that the word 'no' didn't exist in the Beatles' vocabulary."{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=139}} In Martin's opinion, ''Sgt. Pepper'' "grew naturally out of ''Revolver''", marking "an era of almost continuous technological experimentation."<ref>{{harvnb|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=78}}: "continuous technological experimentation"; {{harvnb|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=82}}: ''Sgt.

Pepper'' is that with the latter there was no absolute deadline for completion. He also notes that recording sessions for ''Revolver'' were primarily booked during the afternoon and early evening, whereas sessions for ''Sgt. Pepper'' typically started after 7 pm.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=142}} He ascribes the difference in sound between the two albums to the fact that ''Revolver'' was primarily recorded in Abbey Road Studio Three, which is a much smaller room and a "dirtier sounding studio acoustically" than Studio Two.{{sfn|Scapelliti|2007|p=96}}}}

{{quote box|quote= Music papers started to slag us off&nbsp;... because [''Sgt.

"Strawberry Fields Forever" and "Penny Lane" were subsequently released as a [[double A-side]] in February 1967 after EMI and Epstein pressured Martin for a single.{{sfn|Moore|1997|pp=19<U+2013>20}} When it failed to reach number one in the UK, British press agencies speculated that the group's run of success might have ended, with headlines such as "Beatles Fail to Reach the Top", "First Time in Four Years" and "Has the Bubble Burst?"{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=714}} After the release the childhood concept was abandoned in favour of ''Sgt.

''Sgt. Pepper'' was recorded using [[Multitrack recording|four-track]] equipment. Although eight-track tape recorders were available in the US, the first units were not operational in commercial studios in London until late 1967.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=191}}{{refn|group=nb|Eight-track recorders were first used on a Beatles album in 1968, during sessions for the ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]''.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=176}}}} As with previous Beatles albums, the ''Sgt. Pepper'' recordings made extensive use of the technique known as [[Ping-pong recording|reduction mixing]], in which one to four tracks from one recorder are mixed and [[dubbing (music)|dubbed]] down onto a master four-track machine, enabling the Abbey Road engineers to give the group a virtual multitrack studio.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2009|p=29}} EMI's [[Studer]] J-37 four-track machines were well suited to reduction mixing, as the high quality of the recordings that they produced minimised the increased noise associated with the process.{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|p=199}} Preferring to overdub his bass part last, McCartney tended to play other instruments when recording a song's backing track. This approach afforded him the extra time required to write and record melodic basslines that complemented the song's final arrangement.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|pp=169<U+2013>170}} He also performed most of the album's lead guitar work.{{sfn|Scapelliti|2007|p=96}} When recording the orchestra for "[[A Day In The Life]]", Martin synchronised a four-track recorder playing the Beatles' backing track to another one taping the orchestral overdub. The engineer [[Ken Townsend]] devised a method for accomplishing this by using a 50&nbsp;Hz control signal between the two machines.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=244}}

A key feature of ''Sgt. Pepper'' is Martin and Emerick's liberal use of [[signal processing]] to shape the sound of the recording, which included the application of [[dynamic range compression]], [[reverberation]] and [[Limiter|signal limiting]].{{sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=133}} Relatively new modular effects units were used, such as running voices and instruments through a [[Leslie speaker]].{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=190}} Several innovative production techniques feature prominently on the recordings, including [[DI unit|direct injection]], [[pitch control]] and [[ambiophonics]].{{sfn|Hannan|2008|p=62}} Another is [[automatic double tracking]] (ADT), a system that uses tape recorders to create a simultaneous doubling of a sound. Although it had long been recognised that using multitrack tape to record doubled lead vocals produced an enhanced sound, before ADT it had been necessary to record such vocal tracks twice, a task that was both tedious and exacting. ADT was invented during the ''Revolver'' sessions in 1966, especially for the Beatles by Townsend, who disliked tracking sessions and regularly expressed a desire for a technical solution to the problem. The process soon became a common recording practice in popular music.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=216}} Martin playfully explained to Lennon that his voice had been "treated with a double vibrocated sploshing flange&nbsp;... It doubles your voice, John."{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|pp=82<U+2013>83}} Lennon realised that Martin was joking, but from that point on he referred to the effect as [[flanging]], a label that was universally adopted by the music industry.{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|pp=82<U+2013>83}} Another important effect was [[Pitch shift|varispeeding]].{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=190}} Martin cites "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]" has having the most variations of tape speed on ''Sgt. Pepper''. During the recording of Lennon's vocals, the tape speed was reduced from 50 cycles per second to 45, which produced a higher and thinner-sounding track when played back at the normal speed.{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=105}}

{{quote box|quote= Listening to each stage of their recording, once they've done the first couple of tracks, it's often hard to see what they're still looking for, it sounds so complete. Often the final complicated, well-layered version seems to have drowned the initial simple melody. But they know it's not right, even if they can't put it into words. Their dedication is impressive, gnawing away at the same song for stretches of ten hours each.{{sfn|Davies|2009|pp=273<U+2013>274}}|source=<U+2014>[[Hunter Davies]], 1968|width=33%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

In an effort to get the right sound, the Beatles attempted numerous re-takes of "Getting Better". When the decision was made to re-record the basic track, Starr was summoned to the studio, but called off soon afterwards as the focus switched from rhythm to vocal tracking.{{sfn|Davies|2009|p=270}} Starr, who after the completion of his basic drum parts saw his participation limited to minor percussion overdubs, later lamented: "The biggest memory I have of ''Sgt.

Concerns that some of the lyrics in ''Sgt.

McCartney acts as the [[master of ceremonies]] near the end of the "Sgt.

Despite widespread suspicion that the title of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" contained a hidden reference to LSD, Lennon insisted that it was derived from a [[pastel]] drawing by his four-year-old son [[Julian Lennon|Julian]].

She is buying an egg and it turns into Humpty Dumpty. The woman serving in the shop turns into a sheep and the next minute they are&nbsp;... in a rowing boat and I was visualizing that. There was also the image of the female who would someday come to save me <U+2013> a 'girl with kaleidoscope eyes' who would come out of the sky. It turned out to be Yoko&nbsp;... so maybe it should be 'Yoko in the Sky with Diamonds'."{{sfn|Sheff|1981|p=181}}

MacDonald considers "Getting Better" to contain "the most ebullient performance" on ''Sgt. Pepper''.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=241}} Womack credits the track's "driving rock sound" with distinguishing it from the album's overtly psychedelic material; its lyrics inspire the listener "to usurp the past by living well and flourishing in the present."{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=172}} He cites it as a strong example of Lennon and McCartney's collaborative songwriting, particularly Lennon's addition of the line: "couldn't get much worse", which serves as a "sarcastic rejoinder" to McCartney's chorus: "It's getting better all the time".{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=173}} McCartney describes Lennon's lyric as "sardonic" and "against the spirit of the song", which he characterises as "typical John."{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=106}}{{refn|group=nb|Lennon's contribution to the lyric includes a confessional regarding his having been violent with female companions: "I used to be cruel to my woman".{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=173}} He explained: "I was a hitter.

Womack interprets the lyric to "Fixing a Hole" as "the speaker's search for identity among the crowd", in particular the "quests for consciousness and connection" that differentiate individuals from society as a whole.{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=173}} MacDonald characterises it as a "distracted and introverted track", during which McCartney forgoes his "usual smooth design" in favour of "something more preoccupied".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=236}} He cites Harrison's electric guitar solo as serving the track well, capturing its mood by conveying detachment.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=236}} McCartney drew inspiration for the song in part from his work restoring a Scottish farmhouse.{{sfn|Everett|1999|pp=106<U+2013>107}} Womack notes his adaptation of the lyric: "a hole in the roof where the rain leaks in" from [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[We're Gonna Move]]".{{sfn|Womack|2007|pp=106<U+2013>107}} The song deals with McCartney's desire to let his mind wander freely and to express his creativity without the burden of self-conscious insecurities.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=314<U+2013>315}}

In Everett's view, the lyrics to "[[She's Leaving Home]]" address the problem of alienation "between disagreeing peoples", particularly those distanced from each other by the [[generation gap]].{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=107}} McCartney's "descriptive narration", which details the plight of a "lonely girl" who escapes the control of her "selfish yet well-meaning parents", was inspired by a piece about teenage runaways published by the ''[[Daily Mail]]''.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=108}} It is the first track on ''Sgt.

Moore notes that the writers judge the work from "opposing criteria", with Goldstein opining during the dawn of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] whereas MacDonald <U+2013> writing in 1995 <U+2013> is "intensely aware of [the movement's] failings."{{sfn|Moore|1997|p=37}}

Lennon adapted the lyric for "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" from an 1843 poster for [[Pablo Fanque]]'s circus that he purchased at an antique shop in [[Kent]] on the day of filming the [[Music video|promotional film]] for "Strawberry Fields Forever".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=237<U+2013>238}} Womack praises the track's successful blending of a print source and music: "The interpretive power of the mixed-media application accrues its meaning through the musical production with which the group imbues the Ur-text of the poster."{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=175}} MacDonald notes Lennon's request for a "fairground production wherein one could smell the sawdust", an atmosphere that Martin and Emerick attempted to create with a [[sound collage]] that comprised randomly assembled recordings of harmoniums, harmonicas and [[Calliope (music)|calliopes]].<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=237<U+2013>238}}; {{harvnb|Moore|1997|p=40}}.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Emerick first employed this method in 1966, while creating the ambiance for "[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]" from ''Revolver''.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=168}}}} MacDonald describes the song as "a spontaneous expression of its author's playful hedonism".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=238}} Everett thinks that the track's use of Edwardian imagery thematically links it with the album's opening number.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=110}}

MacDonald cites "When I'm Sixty-Four" as an example of the Beatles' versatility. He characterises the song as "aimed chiefly at parents", borrowing heavily from the English music hall style of [[George Formby, Sr.|George Formby]], while invoking images of the illustrator [[Donald McGill]]'s "seaside postcards".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=220<U+2013>221}} Its sparse arrangement includes chimes, clarinet and piano.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=220}} He notes that the track receives a "cool reception" from most younger listeners and Everett singles it out as a case of McCartney's "penchant for the audience-charming vaudeville&nbsp;... that Lennon detested".<ref>{{harvnb|Everett|1999|p=113}}: McCartney's "penchant for the audience-charming vaudeville"; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=221}}: a "cool reception"</ref> McCartney wrote the tune in the late 1950s as an instrumental piece, and a version of it was occasionally performed by the Beatles during [[The Beatles in Hamburg|shows in Hamburg]].<ref>{{harvnb|Everett|1999|p=112}}: written in the late 1950s; {{harvnb|Womack|2007|p=177}}: performed in Hamburg.</ref> He revisited the composition in 1966, around the time of his father's sixty-fourth birthday.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=112}} Moore characterises the song as a synthesis of [[ragtime]] and pop, noting that its position following "Within You Without You" <U+2013> a blend of Indian classical music and pop <U+2013> demonstrates the diversity of the album's material.{{sfn|Moore|1997|p=47}} McCartney requested the clarinets and asked that they be arranged "in a classical way", which according to Martin "got&nbsp;... round the lurking schmaltz factor&nbsp;... [and] gave added bite to the song, a formality that pushed it firmly towards satire."{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=34}} MacDonald notes that the song's inclusion amidst ''Sgt. Pepper''{{'s}} "multi-layered psychedelic textures&nbsp;... provid[es] a down-to-earth interlude".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=220<U+2013>221}} Moore credits Martin's clarinet arrangement and Starr's use of [[Percussion mallet#Brushes|brushes]] with establishing the music hall atmosphere, which is reinforced by McCartney's vocal delivery and the recording's use of [[chromaticism]], a harmonic pattern that can be traced to [[Scott Joplin]]'s "[[The Ragtime Dance]]" and ''[[The Blue Danube]]'' by [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]].{{sfn|Moore|1997|p=46}} Varispeeding was used on the track, raising the music's pitch by a [[semitone]] in an attempt to make McCartney sound younger.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=137}} Everett notes that the lyric's protagonist is sometimes associated with the Lonely Hearts Club Band, but in his opinion the song is thematically unconnected to the others on the album.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=113}}

Womack characterises "Lovely Rita" as a work of "full-tilt psychedelia" that contrasts sharply with the preceding track.{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=177}} He identifies the song as an example of McCartney's talent for "creating imagistic musical portraiture", but considers it to be among the album's weakest offerings, presaging what he describes as the "less effectual compositions" that the Beatles would record post-''Sgt. Pepper''.{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=177}} In his view, "the song accomplishes little in the way of advancing the album's journey toward a more expansive human consciousness".{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=177}} Despite his reservations, he considers the track to be "irresistibly charming".{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=177}} Moore agrees, describing the composition as a "throwaway" while praising what he characterises as its "strong sense of harmonic direction".{{sfn|Moore|1997|p=48}} MacDonald describes the song as a "satire on authority" that is "imbued with an exuberant interest in life that lifts the spirits, dispersing self-absorption".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=239}}

"[[Good Morning Good Morning]]" was inspired by a television commercial for [[Kellogg's]] Corn Flakes, from which Lennon adapted a jingle as the song's [[refrain]]. The track utilises the bluesy mixolydian mode in A, which Everett credits with "perfectly express[ing] Lennon's grievance against complacency."<ref>{{harvnb|Everett|1999|p=116}}: "grievance against complacency"; {{harvnb|Moore|1997|p=50}}: the bluesy [[mixolydian mode]] in A.</ref> Lennon regarded the song as "a throwaway piece of garbage", and McCartney viewed it as Lennon's reaction to the frustrations of domestic life.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=234}} Womack praises the song's varied [[time signature]]s, including 5/4, 3/4 and 4/4, calling it a "masterpiece of electrical energy".{{sfn|Womack|2007|pp=177<U+2013>178}} MacDonald notes Starr's "fine performance" and McCartney's "coruscating pseudo-Indian guitar solo", which he credits with delivering the track's climax.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=235}} A series of animal noises are heard during the [[Fade (audio engineering)|fade-out]] that are sequenced <U+2013> at Lennon's request <U+2013> so that each successive animal is large enough to devour the preceding one.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=235}} Martin spliced the sound of a chicken clucking at the end of the track to overlap with a guitar being tuned in the next one, making a seamless transition between the two songs.{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=75}}

"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)" serves as a bookend for the album and a segue to its finale. The hard-rocking song was written after the Beatles' assistant, Neil Aspinall, suggested that since "Sgt. Pepper" opened the album the fictional band should make an appearance near the end.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=248}} The [[reprise]] omits the brass section from the title track and features a faster tempo.{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=178}} MacDonald notes the Beatles' apparent excitement, which is tangibly translated during the recording.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=248}}

{{listen|pos=right|filename=The "Dream Sequence" from "A Day in the Life" by the Beatles 1967.ogg|title= The "dream sequence" from "A Day in the Life"|description=  Womack describes the "sarcastic brass retort" that ends the sequence as the "most decisive moment" on ''Sgt. Pepper''.{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=181}}}}

As the last chord of the "Sgt. Pepper" reprise plays, an acoustic guitar strumming offbeat [[Eighth note|quavers]] begins, introducing what Moore describes as "one of the most harrowing songs ever written."{{sfn|Moore|1997|p=52}} "A Day in the Life" consists of four verses by Lennon, a bridge, two [[Aleatoricism|aleatoric]] orchestral [[crescendo]]s and an interpolated middle part written and sung by McCartney. The first crescendo serves as a segue between the third verse and the middle part, leading to a bridge known as the "dream sequence", which features Lennon's vocalisations.{{sfn|Moore|1997|p=52}} In Martin's opinion, the "vocal wailings", which are treated with tape echo and slowly [[Panning (audio)|panned]] from right to left and back again before suddenly ending in the left speaker, contribute to the song's "reception as a 'marijuana dream'".<ref>{{harvnb|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=156}}: "vocal wailings", {{harvnb|Riley|1988|pp=227<U+2013>228}}: panning.</ref> The accompanying [[brass section]] loudly indicates the end of the sequence and the start of the fourth and final verse, after which the song enters the last crescendo before finishing with a piano chord that is allowed to fade out for nearly a minute.<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|1997|p=54}}; {{harvnb|Riley|1988|p=228}}: an aggressive [[brass section]].</ref> The idea to use an orchestra was McCartney's; he drew inspiration from the avant-garde composers [[John Cage]] and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]].{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=56}} The 24-bar crescendos feature forty musicians selected from the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra|London]] and [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]s and tasked with filling the space with what Womack describes as "the sound of pure apocalypse".{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=179}} Martin notes Lennon's request for "a tremendous build-up, from nothing up to something absolutely like the end of the world".{{sfn|Martin|1994|p=209}} Lennon recalled drawing inspiration for the lyrics from a newspaper: "I was writing the song with the ''Daily Mail'' propped up in front of me at the piano&nbsp;... there was a paragraph about 4000 [pot]holes in [[Blackburn]], Lancashire".{{sfn|Davies|2009|p=275}}{{refn|group=nb|The "lucky man who made the grade" was inspired by <U+2013> but not directly based on <U+2013> the recent accidental death of Beatles friend and [[Guinness]] heir Tara Brown. Lennon noted he "didn't copy the accident. Tara didn't blow his mind out, but it was in my mind when I was writing that verse."{{sfn|Davies|2009|p=276}} According to Martin the line: "he blew his mind out in a car" is a drug reference.{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=50}}}} He strongly disliked the sound of his own voice and often asked for generous amounts of [[tape echo]] to be added to his vocal in an effort to bury it deep in the mix. For "A Day in the Life", he wanted his voice to sound like Elvis Presley on "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]". Martin and Emerick obliged by adding 90 milliseconds of echo.{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|pp=52<U+2013>53}} Womack describes Starr's performance as "one of his most inventive drum parts on record", a part that McCartney encouraged him to attempt despite his protests against "flashy drumming".{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=179}} The thunderous piano chord that concludes the track and the album was produced by recording Lennon, Starr, McCartney and Evans simultaneously sounding an E major chord on three separate pianos; Martin then augmented the sound with a harmonium.{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=180}}{{refn|group=nb|Recordings of "[[A Day in the Life]]" began on 19 January 1967 with Lennon counting-in the first take by mumbling, "sugar plum fairy, sugar plum fairy".{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=179}} McCartney's lead vocal in the middle of the track was recorded the next day and the orchestral overdub session occurred on 10 February. Martin recorded four tracks of the orchestral musicians and layered them into a composite track.{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=59}} The final piano chord was recorded twelve days later.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=241, 244<U+2013>245, 247}}}} Riley characterises the song as a "postlude to the ''Pepper'' fantasy&nbsp;... that sets all the other songs in perspective", while shattering the illusion of "Pepperland" by introducing the "parallel universe of everyday life".{{sfn|Riley|1988|p=225}} MacDonald describes the track as "a song not of disillusionment with life itself, but of disenchantment with the limits of mundane perception".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=229}} According to him, it "remains among the most penetrating and innovative artistic reflections of its era", representing the Beatles' "finest single achievement".<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=228}}: "finest single achievement"; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=232}}: "among the most penetrating and innovative artistic reflections".</ref>

As "A Day in the Life" ends, a 15-[[kilohertz]] high-frequency tone is heard; it was added at Lennon's suggestion with the intention that it would annoy dogs.{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=182}}{{refn|group=nb|Lennon was unaware that most record players and speakers of the time were incapable of reproducing the tone, which many listeners would not hear until the release of the CD version in 1987.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=188}}}} This is followed by the sounds of backwards laughter and random gibberish that was pressed into the record's concentric run-out groove, which loops back into itself endlessly on any record player not equipped with an automatic needle return. Lennon can be heard saying: "been so high", followed by McCartney's response: "never could be any other way".{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=122}}{{refn|group=nb|When the audio contained in the run-out groove is played in reverse and slowed-down, McCartney can be heard shouting: "I will fuck you like Superman", with Starr and Harrison giggling in the background.{{sfn|Julien|2008c|p=164}} When the album was re-pressed for LP release in 2012, it took several attempts to successfully reproduce the run-out groove effect.<ref>{{cite web|last=Knopper |first=Steve |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-beatles-vinyl-album-remasters-20121112 |title=Inside the Beatles' Vinyl Album Remasters |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=12 November 2012 |accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref>}}

The 30 March 1967 photo session with Cooper also produced the back cover and the inside gatefold, which the musicologist Ian Inglis describes as conveying "an obvious and immediate warmth&nbsp;... which distances it from the sterility and artifice typical of such images."{{sfn|Inglis|2008|p=95}} McCartney explained: "One of the things we were very much into in those days was eye messages&nbsp;... So with Michael Cooper's inside photo, we all said, 'Now look into this camera and really say I love you! Really try and feel love; really give love through this! It'll come out; it'll show; it's an attitude.' And that's what that is, if you look at it you'll see the big effort from the eyes."{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=344<U+2013>345}} The album's inner sleeve featured artwork by the Dutch design team [[The Fool (design collective)|the Fool]] that eschewed for the first time the standard white paper in favour of an abstract pattern of waves of maroon, red, pink and white.{{sfn|Inglis|2008|p=95}} Included with the album as a bonus gift was a sheet of cardboard cut-outs designed by Blake and Haworth, a postcard-sized portrait of Sgt.

After finishing ''Sgt.

One of the best-known American critics at the time, Richard Goldstein, wrote a scathing contemporary review in ''The New York Times'' that described ''Sgt.

==Reappraisal==
{{quote box|quote= The Beatles themselves never pretended they were creating art with ''Sgt. Pepper'', or scrabbling after some musical integrity. They just wanted to do something different.{{sfn|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=2}}|source=<U+2014>[[George Martin]], from his book ''Summer of Love: The making of Sgt. Pepper'', 1994|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

While gathering material for his 1979 anthology, ''Stranded: Rock and Roll for a Desert Island'', the editor [[Greil Marcus]] polled the twenty rock critic contributors regarding their choice for the best rock album of all time, and while ''Rubber Soul'' was mentioned ''Sgt. Pepper'' was not.{{sfn|Marcus|2007|p=xxi}} He asserts that by 1968 the album appeared vacuous against the emotional backdrop of the political and social upheavals of American life, describing it as "a triumph of effects", but "a Day-Glo tombstone for its time".<ref>{{harvnb|Marcus|2007|p=258}}: "a Day-Glo tombstone for its time"; {{harvnb|Moore|1997|p=60}}: "a triumph of effects".</ref> He characterises the LP as "playful but contrived" and "less a summing up of its era than a concession to it".{{sfn|Riley|1988|p=205}} Marcus believes that the album "strangled on its own conceits" while being "vindicated by world-wide acclaim".{{sfn|Marcus|2007|p=248}}{{refn|group=nb|According to Riley, ''Rubber Soul'' and ''Revolver'' are "miracles of intuition" that are "greater than the sum of their parts" while in comparison "''Sgt. Pepper'' is tinged with conceit."{{sfn|Riley|1988|pp=204<U+2013>205}} He describes ''Sgt. Pepper'' as "a flawed masterpiece that can only echo the strength of ''Revolver''.{{sfn|Riley|1988|p=203}}}}

In 1981 Christgau stated that although few critics agreed with Goldstein at the time of his negative contemporary review, many later came to appreciate his sentiments.{{sfn|Moore|1997|p=59}} In the opinion of [[Lester Bangs]] <U+2013> the so-called "godfather" of [[punk rock]] journalism, also writing in 1981 <U+2013> "Goldstein was right in his much-vilified review&nbsp;... predicting that this record had the power to almost singlehandedly destroy rock and roll."{{sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=122}}{{refn|group=nb|The central theme of Goldstein's 1967 critique of ''Sgt. Pepper'' involves his complaints about substance overwhelming style, or in his words: "tone overtakes meaning".{{sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=130}} He places much of the blame for this on the album's copious use of production effects such as [[echo]] and [[Reverberation|reverb]], which he characterises as "posturing and put-on".{{sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=130}} He also criticises the album's lack of lyrical substance, stating: "even from fantasy, I expect authenticity".{{sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=130}}}} He notes: "In the sixties rock and roll began to think of itself as an 'art form'. Rock and roll is not an 'art form'; rock and roll is a raw wail from the bottom of the guts."{{sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=135}} The musicologist John Kimsey cites the preservation of authenticity as a guiding tenet of rock music and suggests that many purists denounce ''Sgt. Pepper'' in that respect, accusing the album of "mark[ing] a fall from primal grace into pretense, production and self-consciousness."{{sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=122}}{{refn|group=nb|Kimsey notes that with ''Sgt. Pepper'', "rock began to be called most emphatically an art form."{{sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=135}} According to Bangs, [[punk rock]] "is rock in its most basic, primitive form", a stylistic approach that is decidedly unselfconscious.{{sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=135}} In Riley's opinion, ''Sgt. Pepper'' "has a degree of self-consciousness throughout that primitive rock and roll snubs in favor of urgency and raw energy."{{sfn|Riley|1988|p=203}} In late 1967 ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine published an unfavourable review written by John Gabree, in which he questions where the proper credit for ''Sgt. Pepper'' should lie based on his having heard that "A Day in the Life" consisted of two songs that had been spliced together by Martin. Kimsey cites this as an example of detractors conflating ethical concerns with issues of aesthetics while casting doubt on the musical authenticity of the work.{{sfn|Kimsey|2008|pp=124<U+2013>125}}}} In his opinion, detractors regard the LP as less a breakthrough and more a "break ''with'' all that's good, true and rocking".{{sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=122}}{{refn|group=nb|According to Kimsey, rock purists like Bangs <U+2013> whom he characterises as a "punk ideologue" <U+2013> approach the problem of authenticity with the presupposition that true rock music is inherently "uncorrupted by skill or self-consciousness".{{sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=135}} He compares Bangs' conception of the "attitude-driven everyman" with [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s [[noble savage]], suggesting that Bangs' disdain for ''Sgt. Pepper'' is informed by a [[Romanticism|Romanticised]] rejection of [[Modernism]].{{sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=135}} According to Kimsey, "In this sense, ''Pepper'' can be said to have called forth, in dialectical fashion, the discourse of punk."{{sfn|Kimsey|2008|p=135}}}} According to Christgau: "Although ''Sgt. Pepper'' is thought of as the most influential of all rock masterpieces, it is really only the most famous. In retrospect it seems peculiarly [[wikt:apollonian#English|apollonian]] <U+2013> precise, controlled, even stiff <U+2013> and it is clearly peripheral to the rock mainstream".<ref>{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/rocktheater.php|title=Rock Theater|publisher=Robert Christgau|accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref> In Moore's estimation, "because its cultural impact was so large, it was simply being asked to do too much."{{sfn|Moore|1997|p=64}}

===Concept===
According to Womack, with ''Sgt. Pepper''{{'s}} first song "the Beatles manufacture an artificial textual space in which to stage their art."{{sfn|Womack|2007|p=170}} The reprise of the title song appears on side two, just prior to the climactic "A Day in the Life", creating a [[framing device]].{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=248}} In Starr's opinion, only the first two songs and the reprise are conceptually connected.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=99}} Lennon agreed and in 1980 he commented: "''Sgt. Pepper'' is called the first concept album, but it doesn't go anywhere&nbsp;... it works because we ''said'' it worked."{{sfn|Sheff|1981|p=197}} He was especially adamant that his contributions to the LP had nothing to do with the Sgt. Pepper concept. Further, he suggested that most of the other songs were equally unconnected, stating: "Except for Sgt. Pepper introducing Billy Shears and the so-called reprise, every other song could have been on any other album".{{sfn|Sheff|1981|p=197}} Martin became worried upon the album's completion that its lack of musical unity might draw criticism and accusations of pretentiousness.<ref>{{harvnb|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=150}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Moore|1997|p=64}}: (secondary source).</ref>

MacFarlane notes that <U+2013> despite these concerns <U+2013> ''Sgt. Pepper'' "is widely regarded as the first true concept album in popular music."{{sfn|MacFarlane|2008|p=33}} In his view, the Beatles "chose to employ an overarching thematic concept in an apparent effort to unify individual tracks."{{sfn|MacFarlane|2008|p=33}} Everett contends that the album's "musical unity results&nbsp;... from motivic relationships between key areas, particularly involving C, E, and G."{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=122}} Moore argues that the recording's "use of common harmonic patterns and falling melodies" contributes to its overall cohesiveness, which he describes as narrative unity, but not necessarily conceptual unity.{{sfn|Moore|2008|p=144}} MacFarlane agrees, suggesting that with the exception of the reprise the album lacks the melodic and harmonic continuity that is consistent with cyclic form.{{sfn|MacFarlane|2008|pp=33, 37}} In a May 1967 review published by ''[[The Times]]'', the music critic [[William Mann (critic)|William Mann]] made a similar observation, indicating a thematic connection between the title track, its reprise and "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!", while suggesting that <U+2013> aside from those songs <U+2013> the album's "unity is slightly specious".{{sfn|MacFarlane|2008|p=37}} In 1972 the musicologist Richard Middleton suggested that the album was "undercoded", in that listeners could grasp only a general understanding of the material that, in his opinion, was not particularly meaningful.{{sfn|Moore|1997|p=65}} Nonetheless, the author Martina Elicker asserts that ''Sgt. Pepper''{{'s}} release familiarised critics and fans alike with the notion of a "concept and unified structure underlying a pop album", thus originating the term [[concept album]].{{sfn|Elicker|2001|p=231}}{{refn|group=nb|According to Riley, "Strictly speaking, the Mothers of Invention's ''Freak Out!'' has claims as the first 'concept album', but ''Sgt. Pepper'' was the record that made that idea convincing to most ears."{{sfn|Riley|1988|p=11}}}}

==Legacy==

Musicologists regard ''Sgt. Pepper'' as a continuation of the artistic maturation seen on the Beatles' two preceding albums, ''Revolver'' and ''Rubber Soul''.{{sfn|O'Grady|2008|p=23}} Moore credits it with aiding the development of [[progressive rock]] through its self-conscious lyrics, its studio experimentation, and its efforts to expand the barriers of conventional three-minute tracks.<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|1997|pp=18, 70<U+2013>79}}; {{harvnb|Moore|2002|pp=64}}: the origins of progressive rock are "marked by the release of the Beatles' ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' in 1967"; {{harvnb|Moore|2002|pp=69}}: "The beginnings of progressive rock are normally traced to the Beatles' ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''".</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Moore describes ''Sgt. Pepper'' as "a precursor of progressive rock's infatuation with unified concepts."{{sfn|Moore|2008|p=139}} In the opinion of the author Kevin Holm-Hudson, the album "was pivotal in establishing the progressive aesthetic."{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2008|p=10}} The music journalist Thomas Blackwell credits the LP as being "virtually responsible for the birth of the progressive rock genre".<ref>{{cite web|last=Blackwell|first=Thomas|title=Sgt.

Pepper'' sessions.{{sfn|Julien|2008c|p=162}}}} He credits [[Edgard Var<U+00E8>se]]'s ''[[Po<U+00E8>me <U+00E9>lectronique]]'' as the piece of music that made this advance feasible, by "expand[ing] the definition of sound recording from archival documentation to the reification of the musical canvass"; he identifies "A Day in the Life" as the ''Sgt. Pepper'' track that best exemplifies this approach.{{sfn|MacFarlane|2008|pp=39<U+2013>40}} Although early [[Analog synthesizer|analogue synthesiser]]s were available <U+2013> [[Robert Moog]] was working on the second generation of the first commercially available keyboard around the same time as the ''Sgt. Pepper'' recording sessions <U+2013> none were used during the album's recording, which relied solely on electric and acoustic instruments and field recordings that were available at Abbey Road Studios.<ref>{{harvnb|Hannan|2008|p=46}}: no keyboards were used during the album's recording; {{harvnb|Martin|Pearson|1994|p=108}}: [[Robert Moog]] was working on the second generation keyboard.</ref> The musician and producer [[Alan Parsons]] believes that with ''Sgt. Pepper'' "people then started thinking that you could spend a year making an album and they began to consider an album as a sound composition and not just a musical composition. The idea was gradually forming of a record being a performance in its own right and not just a reproduction of a live performance."{{sfn|Julien|2008c|p=167}}

According to Julien, ''Sgt. Pepper'' represents the "epitome of the transformation of the recording studio into a compositional tool", marking the moment when "popular music entered the era of phonographic composition."{{sfn|Julien|2008c|pp=166<U+2013>167}} Its lasting commercial success and critical impact are largely due to Martin and his engineers' creative use of studio equipment while originating new processes.{{sfn|Hannan|2008|p=46}} Artistic experimentation, such as the placement of random gibberish in the run-out groove, is one of the album's defining features.{{sfn|Julien|2008b|p=7}} In the opinion of the Beatles historian [[Mark Lewisohn]], ''Sgt. Pepper'' represents the group's last unified effort, displaying a cohesion that would begin deteriorating immediately following the album's completion and that had entirely disappeared by the release of ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' in 1968.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=237}} Emerick notes the minimal involvement of Harrison and Starr, viewing ''Sgt. Pepper'' as a work of Lennon and McCartney that was less a group effort than any of their previous releases.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=141}}

Inglis notes that almost every account of the significance of ''Sgt. Pepper'' emphasizes the cover's "unprecedented correspondence between music and art, time and space".{{sfn|Inglis|2008|p=101}} After its release, album sleeves were no longer "a superfluous thing to be discarded during the act of listening, but an integral component of the listening that expanded the musical experience."{{sfn|Inglis|2008|p=101}} The cover helped to elevate album art as a respected topic for critical analysis whereby the "structures and cultures of popular music" could henceforth justify intellectual discourse in a way that <U+2013> before ''Sgt. Pepper'' <U+2013> would have seemed like "fanciful conceit".{{sfn|Inglis|2008|p=102}} He writes: ''Sgt. Pepper''{{'s}} "cover has been regarded as groundbreaking in its visual and aesthetic properties, congratulated for its innovative and imaginative design, credited with providing an early impetus for the expansion of the graphic design industry into popular music, and perceived as largely responsible for the connections between art and pop to be made explicit."{{sfn|Inglis|2008|p=102}} Riley describes it as "one of the best-known works that pop art ever produced".{{sfn|Riley|1988|p=212}} In the late 1990s the BBC included it in its list of British masterpieces of twentieth-century art and design.{{sfn|Inglis|2008|p=96}} In 2008 the iconic bass drum skin used on the front cover sold at auction for <U+20AC>670,000.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0711/beatles.html |title=Fab four times price for Beatles drumskin|date=11 July 2008|work=RT<U+00C9> news|publisher=RT<U+00C9> Commercial Enterprises Limited|accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|On 30 March 2013 a copy of ''Sgt.
