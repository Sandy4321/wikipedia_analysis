The '''Battle of St Kitts''', also known as the '''Battle of Frigate Bay''', took place on [[25 January|25]] and [[26 January]] [[1782]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]] between a British fleet under Rear-Admiral [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Sir Samuel Hood]] and a larger French fleet under the [[Comte de Grasse]].

When [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Hood]] returned to the West Indies in late [[1781]] after the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], he was for a time in independent command owing to [[George Rodney|Rodney]]'s absence in England. The French Admiral, the [[Comte de Grasse]], attacked the British islands of [[St Kitts]] and [[Nevis]] with a much superior force to the squadron under Hood's command. The attempt Hood made in January 1782 to save them from capture, with 22 ships to 29, was not successful, but the series of bold movements by which he first turned the French out of their anchorage at the Basse Terre of St Kitts, and then beat off the attacks of the enemy, were the most brilliant things done by any British admiral during the war.

Hood, with an inferior force first drove De Grasse from his anchorage at [[Basseterre]], anchored there himself and then repulsed De Grasse's repeated attacks the following. But despite outmanoeuvering De Grasse, Hood was unable to save the island from surrendering to the French.
