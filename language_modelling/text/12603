'''''Kahaani''''' ({{IPA-hns|<U+02C8>k ha<U+02D0>a<U+02D0> <U+0273>i<U+02D0>|IPA}}; {{lang-en|''Story''}}) is a 2012 [[Cinema of India|Indian]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller film]] directed, co-written and co-produced by [[Sujoy Ghosh]]. The film features [[Vidya Balan]], [[Parambrata Chatterjee]] and [[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]] in lead roles. Balan portrays the role of Vidya Bagchi, a pregnant woman in search of her missing husband in the city of [[Kolkata]] during the [[Durga Puja]] festivities, who is helped in her quest by Satyaki "Rana" Sinha (Chatterjee) and Khan (Siddiqui).

Made on a shoestring budget of {{INRConvert|8|c}}, ''Kahaani'' was developed by writer Advaita Kala, based on the initial idea from Ghosh. The film explores themes of [[feminism]] and [[motherhood]] in a predominantly male-dominated [[Socio-economic issues in India|Indian society]]. Filming took place on the streets of Kolkata with Ghosh employing the art of [[guerrilla filmmaking]] to avoid unwanted attention. Ghosh admitted to using several allusions to [[Satyajit Ray]]'s films such as ''[[Charulata]]'' (1964) and ''[[Aranyer Dinratri]]'' (1970). Additionally, critics compared the [[twist ending]] of the plot to the Hollywood film ''[[Taking Lives (film)|Taking Lives]]'' (2004). The film was noted for a deft portrayal of Kolkata and use of a significant number of crew and cast members from the city.

''Kahaani'' released worldwide on 9 March 2012 to major critical acclaim with praise directed to the screenplay, the cinematography and the performances of the lead actors. Word of mouth publicity and good critical response paved the way for ''Kahaani'' to emerge as a major commercial success at the box office, with a 50 day worldwide gross of {{INRConvert|104|c}}. The film resulted in renewed interest in Kolkata as a filming location, and the character of contract killer Bob Biswas became an [[internet phenomenon]] in India.

== Plot ==
The film opens with a poison-gas attack on a [[Kolkata Metro|Kolkata Metro Rail]] compartment, killing the passengers on board. Two years after the incident, a [[London]]-based pregnant [[software engineer]] Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan) arrives in [[Kolkata]] around [[Durga Puja]] festivities in search of her missing husband, Arnab Bagchi. A police officer Satyaki "Rana" Sinha (Parambrata Chatterjee) offers her help. Although Vidya claims that Arnab came on an assignment for the National Data Center (NDC), initial probes suggest that no person named Arnab was working in NDC.

Agnes D'mello, HR head at NDC, suggests to Vidya that her husband resembled Milan Damji (Indraneil Sengupta), an ex-employee of NDC. Before Agnes could obtain Damji's records, she is killed by Bob Biswas (Saswata Chatterjee), an assassin working undercover as a life insurance agent. Vidya and Rana break into the old office of NDC to collect documents on Damji. They barely manage to escape a close brush with Bob, also looking for the documents. Meanwhile, the attempts to obtain Damji's records rattle two [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] (IB) officials<U+2014>the IB chief K. Bhaskaran (Dhritiman Chatterjee) and his deputy Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui). Khan arrives in Kolkata and reveals that Damji was an IB agent gone rogue and was responsible for the poison-gas attack. In spite of warnings by Khan, Vidya continues her relentless search, fearing that Arnab's resemblance to Damji has led him into trouble.

The residential address on Damji's record leads Vidya and Rana to a dilapidated flat. An errand boy of the neighbourhood tea stall, Poltu, informs them that the resident of that flat occasionally had a visitor. Poltu identifies R. Sridhar, an officer of NDC, as the person who had visited Damji's flat. This leads Sridhar to instruct Bob to kill Vidya. Following a failed attempt to kill Vidya, Bob is run over by a [[Tempo (car)|tempo]] during a chase. Examination of Bob's mobile phone leads Vidya and Rana to an IP address sending instructions to kill her. They break into Sridhar's office to verify his IP address but Sridhar gets alerted electronically, and returns to his office pursuing the duo. Following a scuffle, Vidya shoots Sridhar accidentally which upsets Khan as he wanted Sridhar alive.

Khan reveals that Rana had been working for him all along, using Vidya as a tool. Although not happy at being used as a ploy, Vidya agrees to help Khan on his request but ignores Rana. Sridhar's computer data reveals a code which is deciphered to be Bhaskaran's phone number. Vidya calls Bhaskaran to tell him that she has retrieved sensitive documents from Sridhar's office and if Bhaskaran helps Vidya find her husband, she would hand over the documents to him. Bhaskaran tells Vidya to contact the local police as he is not associated with this. However, Vidya soon gets a call from an unknown number, warning her that she should hand over the documents to the caller if she wishes to see her husband alive. Khan thinks the caller is Milan Damji.

As instructed, Vidya goes to meet Damji, with Rana and Khan in pursuit. During their negotiations about the documents and the whereabouts of her husband, Damji attacks Vidya hitting her in the abdomen. He points his gun at Vidya to kill her, but is thwarted by the prosthetic abdomen which Vidya has been using to fake her pregnancy. She kills a baffled Damji and flees in the crowd before the arrival of police, leaving a thank you note for Rana and a pen drive containing data from Sridhar's computer. Rana, based on several past incidences, deduces that no Vidya or Arnab Bagchi ever existed. It is she who has been using the police and IB for her motive. The data from the drive leads to Bhaskaran's arrest. Vidya is revealed as the widow of Arup Basu (Abir Chatterjee), an IB officer and a colleague of Damji, who was killed in the poison-gas attack. In her mission to take revenge of her husband's death, Vidya was helped by retired IB officer Colonel Bajpai (Darshan Jariwala), who suspected the involvement of some top IB officials in the attack.

Ghosh began to work on the screenplay of the film while he was waiting for the release of his previous film ''[[Aladin (2009 film)|Aladin]]'' (2009), but the dismal response to ''Aladin'' was a setback. He had to approach several producers to back him, but was refused<ref name="abp 7 april ghosh"/> and discouraged from making the film owing to three major factors<U+2014>a pregnant woman as the lead star, a bunch of unknown Bengali actors as the supporting cast and Kolkata as a backdrop.<ref>{{cite news|title=''Kahaani'' everything that a film should not be: Sujoy Ghosh|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/bollywood/kahaani-everything-that-a-film-should-not-be-sujoy-ghosh_109182.htm|accessdate=10 April 2012|publisher=Zee News|date=9 April 2012|agency=PTI}}</ref> He finally resumed work in 2010, on the insistence of Balan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/2010/sep/080910-informer-4.htm|title=Finally Sujoy Ghosh's Kahani to go on floor|date=8 September 2010|newspaper=[[Mid Day]]|accessdate=19 March 2012|author=The Hitlist Team}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/news/2012/kahaani-child-of-vidya-balan-sujoy-ghosh-060312.html|title=Kahaani is a child of Vidya Balan: Sujoy Ghosh|date=6 March 2012|work=Oneindia.in|accessdate=19 Mar 2012}}</ref> According to the director, [[Yashraj Films]] nearly agreed to produce the film. However, Ghosh was asked to sign an agreement to direct three films which he eventually declined.<ref name="abp 7 april ghosh"/>

The idea of setting the film in Kolkata came from Bengali film actor [[Prosenjit Chatterjee]], who insisted upon Ghosh to shoot in the city.<ref name="KahaaniOfKahaani">{{cite news|url= http://expressbuzz.com/entertainment/news/the-story-behind-kahaani/366382.html|title=The story behind 'Kahaani'|first=Ayaz|last=Shaikh|date=26 February 2012|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref> Ghosh finalized Kolkata as the background due to several reasons including the director's acquaintance with the city, the mix of modernity and old world charm that the city presents,<ref name="KahaaniOfKahaani"/> and the budget constraints as making cinema in Kolkata is cheaper than [[Mumbai]] or [[Delhi]], the usual shooting location of the majority of [[Bollywood]] films.<ref name="moneycontrol ghosh iv">{{cite news|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/entertainment/if-kahaani-failed-id-have-to-pack-my-baggo-sujoy-ghosh_689018.html|title=If Kahaani failed I'd have to pack my bag & go: Sujoy Ghosh|publisher=Moneycontrol|date=4 Aprl 2012|accessdate=5 April 2012|agency=CNBC-TV18}}</ref>

In an interview with [[Rajeev Masand]] of [[CNN-IBN]], Ghosh admitted that with his two preceding directorial ventures ''[[Aladin (2009 film)|Aladin]]'' and ''[[Home Delivery (film)|Home Delivery]]'' performing miserably at the box ofiice, ''Kahaani'' was his last chance to create a niche.<ref name="ibn ghosh interview flop">{{cite video|people =Ghosh, Sujoy|year =2012|month= March

He related the skeleton of the story to one of his friends in Kolkata during the development of the story. That friend called him back a few days later, and just asked him about how his film was going. The friend mistakenly imagined some sequences which he assumed to be parts of the plot.

=== Casting ===

Vidya Balan was the first choice of both writer Advaita Kala and director Sujoy Ghosh to play the protagonist in ''Kahaani''.<ref name="real life znews"/> Ghosh planned to work with Balan since long and approached her even before Balan's 2010 film ''[[Ishqiya]]'' was released.<ref name=Ghosh@ZN>{{cite news|title='Aladdin' flopped as I failed to tell a story: Sujoy Ghosh|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/aladdin-flopped-as-i-failed-to-tell-a-story-sujoy-ghosh_105652.htm|agency=IANS|publisher=Zee News|accessdate=6 April 2012|date=10 February 2012}}</ref> When Ghosh narrated her the brief initial outline of the plot, Balan turned the offer down. After several rejections, she finally agreed to do the film when she read the completed script.<ref>{{cite news|title=Vidya played choosy before saying yes for 'Kahaani'|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/vidya-played-choosy-before-saying-yes-for-kahaani_105993.htm|publisher=Zee News|agency=IANS|accessdate=21 March 2012|date=16 February 2012}}</ref> On his fascination to cast Balan, Ghosh said, "The good thing about performers like Vidya is that when you give them something, they take it with them and bring something of their own. For me, having Vidya was a boon because she did so many things herself. What she has brought to her character is completely her own. She's a really chilled out actress any director can ask for."<ref name="KahaaniOfKahaani"/>

Apart from Balan, Ghosh chose a host of Bengali actors as he wanted to make the characters look and sound as real as possible.<ref name="Sujoy on toes @ HT">{{cite news|last=Ghosh|first=Debasmita|title=I wanted to be on my toes: Sujoy Ghosh|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/I-wanted-to-be-on-my-toes-Sujoy-Ghosh/Article1-822989.aspx|accessdate=22 May 2012|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=9 March 2012}}</ref> He said, "For me, having actors who look like the characters they play is half the job done.

Ghosh met Chatterjee in 2006 when the latter was showcasing his film ''[[The Bong Connection]]'' at the [[Mumbai Academy of the Moving Image]] festival. Impressed by Chatterjee's work in the film, Ghosh offered him the role in ''Kahaani''.<ref name=Parambrata@Rediff>{{cite web|title=Meet the other hero of Kahaani|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-interview-with-parambrata-chatterjee/20120316.htm|publisher=[[Rediff]]|date=16 March 2012|accessdate=16 March 2012|first=Patcy|last=N}}</ref> Chatterjee had earlier worked with Balan in the [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali film]] ''[[Bhalo Theko]]'' (2003), which was Balan's film debut.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-23/news-interviews/31229680_1_vidya-balan-sujoy-ghosh-film-kahaani|title=Vidya Balan my best co-star: Parambrata Chatterjee|date=23 March 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|accessdate=26 March 2012|agency=PTI}}</ref>

The casting director Roshmi Banerjee suggested Nawazuddin Siddiqui for the role of Khan. Siddiqui, who was doing only minor roles in Bollywood at that time, was surprised that for the first time he got a character where he would not have to portray a beggar.<ref name="abp 7 april ghosh"/> Saswata Chatterjee, another Bengali actor, was surprised as well when he was offered the role of the contract killer Bob Biswas.

Ghosh went against the expectations of casting a popular actor from Bollywood and signed on [[Abir Chatterjee]], an actor of Bengali film industry, to play the role of Balan's husband. According to him, popular Bollywood actors were not willing to work with him after the debacle of his two previous films. He also believed that a known face would have been a disadvantage because there would be popular expectations about increased screen-time for a known actor. He said, "My film is a thriller but the husband is seen in the earliest part of the film by the audience. A known star would have been a spoiler." <ref name="Sujoy @ India West">{{cite web|first=Vijayakar|title=Sujoy Ghosh: 'Kahaani' Could Be the Story of Any Mother|url=http://indiawest.com/news/3597-sujoy-ghosh-kahaani-could-be-the-story-of-any-mother.html|publisher=India West|accessdate=22 May 2012|date=19 March 2012}}</ref> Several other Bengali film and television actors such as Indraneil Sengupta and Kharaj Mukherjee were cast in supporting roles in the film.<ref name="Team Tolly @ TT">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120316/jsp/entertainment/story_15255285.jsp|title=The Kahaani of Team Tolly|date=16 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref>

=== Characters ===
Several characters were thought about in minute detail. Before the shooting of the film began, Balan started flaunting a baby bump to look as close to authentically pregnant as possible for her role. According to news reports, she met doctors and pregnant women to learn about the typical lifestyle and nuances of a pregnant woman, along with making a list of dos and don'ts of pregnancy. The actor made a list of superstitions followed by pregnant women.<ref>{{cite news|title=Vidya Balan gets into character of pregnant woman for 'Kahaani'|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/vidya-balan-gets-into-character-of-pregnant-woman-for-kahaani_104909.htm|accessdate=26 March 2012|publisher=Zee News|date=30 January 2012|agency=[[Asian News International]] (ANI)}}</ref> Balan said that during her college days, she often used to imitate pregnant ladies during stand up acting among friends.<ref name="cakewalk">{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-11/news-interviews/30615282_1_sujoy-ghosh-kahaani-pregnant-woman|title=Playing pregnant woman was cakewalk for Vidya Balan|newspaper=The Times of India|agency=IANS|date=11 January 2012|accessdate=9 May 2012|last=Chaubey|first=Abhishek}}</ref> That experience helped her during the shooting.<ref name="cakewalk"/>

Ghosh, while briefing the character of the contract killer Bob Biswas to the actor Saswata Chatterjee, used the phrase ''"Binito Bob"'' (meaning polite Bob), which crystallized the notion of Bob. Further discussions led to the inclusion of paunch and a bald patch. Saswata devised the mannerism of rubbing his nails together as some Indians believe doing that helps prevent hair fall. The mannerism was well-noted and praised by the viewers.<ref name="toi 30march12chatterjee"/> Ghosh expressed his gratitude to Chatterjee for portraying Bob Biswas in an effective manner. He emphasized that the character of Bob Biswas is akin to a common man, and Chatterjee portrayed it in a way that the viewers can expect Bob to be around them anytime and anywhere.<ref name="Pop art on Saswata # TOI">{{cite news|last=Mukherjee|first=Roshni|title=Pop art on Saswata Chatterjee's character|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-22/news-interviews/31224239_1_sujoy-ghosh-fan-frenzy-character|accessdate=11 June 2012|newspaper=Times of India|date=22 March 2012|agency=TNN}}</ref>

On the character of Rana, Parambrata mentioned, "Rana does not come from an affluent strata of society while I have a very educated and urban background. He has a rural upbringing. For the role, I had to visit some police stations and do some research on their work, mindset and other relevant things. I also got a lot of help from Sujoy and Vidya.

=== Filming ===
Filming took place on the streets of Kolkata with Ghosh often employing the art of [[guerrilla filmmaking]] (shooting in real locations without any previous knowledge of onlookers) to avoid unwanted attention.<ref name="GhoshInterview">{{cite news|title=Vidya Balan is a character driven actress: Sujoy Ghosh|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-11/news-interviews/31145194_1_kahaani-sujoy-ghosh-aladin|accessdate=11 March 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|agency=TNN|date=15 March 2012}}</ref> Ghosh chose a completely new team to work with, barring the music composers [[Vishal-Shekhar]] as he thought the presence of a fresh crew would always keep him on his toes.

The guest house where the protagonist stayed in the film was chosen by Ghosh, who happened to see the three-storied building through the window of a neighboring hotel on an evening in April 2010. The place was later booked for a schedule of 10 days for {{INRConvert|40|k}}.<ref name="StarChamber" /> Ghosh chose a room with windows overlooking a busy road and gave the place an old-fashioned look by replacing the designer grills of the window in the room with old-fashioned wooden ones, and by painting the room with some rough patches. The guest house employees were requested to keep the shooting schedule a secret.<ref name="StarChamber" />

=== Themes ===

According to [[Zee News]], ''Kahaani'' is a [[woman's film]] about "role reversals, breaking of stereotypes, turning clich<U+00E9>s inside out, a woman's journey, and the way she carves a niche for herself in the male-dominated mentalscape of the society."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/vidya-s-kahaani-has-a-male-heroine_107445.htm|title=Vidya's 'Kahaani' has a 'male' heroine!|publisher=Zee News|date=12 March 2012|accessdate=21 March 2012}}</ref> Trisha Gupta of ''[[The Indian Express]]'' refers to Vidya's journey through the streets of Kolkata as "a collective dream<U+2014>the unvoiced dream all women have, in which the city might belong to us as much as it does to men."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/she-belongs-to-the-city/925371/0|title=She belongs to the city|newspaper=Indian Express|date=19 March 2012|accessdate=30 March 2012|first=Trisha|last=Gupta}}</ref> In addition, Ghosh states that one aspect of his project, "is a study of motherhood" which he views as a transformation that women experience from a "petite little girl to the most powerful individual there who will go to any extent to protect her baby even if that includes slapping a physically powerful man if he is messing around. So, it is the protective instinct that draws her out and also something that drove me to write this story."<ref name=Sujoy@Rediff>{{cite web|last=Pathak|first=Ankur|title=There are two heroes in Kahaani: Vidya Balan and Kolkata|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-sujoy-ghosh-vidya-balan-is-the-hero-of-my-film/20120306.htm|publisher=Rediff|date=6 March 2012|accessdate=16 March 2012}}</ref> Some critics suggest that women's films are now more popular after ''[[The Dirty Picture]]'' which won Balan her first [[National Film Award for Best Actress]],<ref name=NFA@Rediff>{{cite web|title=Vidya Balan bags National Award for The Dirty Picture|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/vidya-balan-bags-national-award-for-the-dirty-picture/20120307.htm|accessdate=16 March 2012|publisher=Rediff|date=7 March 2012}}</ref> was well received,<ref>{{cite news|last=S|first= Arpana|title=Bollywood woman power: Vidya, Ekta carry the baton|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/Bollywood-woman-power-Vidya-Ekta-carry-the-baton/Article1-780176.aspx|newspaper=Hindustan Times|agency=IANS|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=9 December 2011}}</ref> and had a strong box-office response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/boxdetail.php?page=shownews&articleid=3790&nCat=|title=Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl mixed opening The Dirty Picture super hit|publisher=BoxofficeIndia.com|date=10 December 2011|accessdate=14 December 2011}}</ref> The symbolism of goddess [[Durga]] was utilized in the film, by comparing the protagonist's killing of the villain with the allegorical yearly return of goddess Durga to slay the demon.<ref name="mukherjee TT 4-12-12">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120412/jsp/opinion/story_15361368.jsp#.T6lsl9kqxJF|title=A tale of two cities|last=Mukherjee|first=Uddalak|date=12 April 2012|accessdate=8 May 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref>

A theme that recurred a few times in the film is the fleeting hint of romance between the cop Rana and the protagonist Vidya. Ghosh said in one interview that the delicate romance between these two characters was "the most progressive thing" he did in the film<U+2014>suggesting a boy falling in love with a pregnant woman. The director explained that the boy was initially "fascinated by someone who is literally a hero in his eyes," as Rana was awed by the computer skills of Vidya. Gradually, the fascinated boy moves into a zone where he tries to protect her. Ghosh said that this was his design, but could be performed on screen only because of the outstanding performance of the two actors involved.<ref name="ibn ghosh interview romance">{{cite video

=== Reception ===

The soundtrack received positive reviews with many critics praising the amalgam of Bengali with Hindi lyrics used in the songs. [[CNN-IBN]] mentioned, "''Aami Shotti Bolchi'' not only has interesting lyrics but also conveys the feel of Kolkata. The song is successful even if it expresses about only 20 percent of the local feel of Kolkata. ''Kahaani'' may not be a collector's item but it features right voices as per the overall mood of the album. ''Aami Shotti Bolchi'' and ''Ekla Cholo Re'' have the potential to fetch your attention."<ref>{{cite news|last=Vats|first=Rohit|title=Music review: 'Kahaani' focuses on nostalgia|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/music-review-kahaani-focuses-on-nostalgia/232715-45-76.html|accessdate=30 March 2012|publisher=IBNLive|date=24 February 2012 }}</ref> ''[[Mumbai Mirror]]'' rated the album with 3 stars out of 5 concluding that, "Good music certainly has its way of standing out among the ordinary."<ref>{{cite news|title=Kahaani music review|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-29/music-reviews/31110240_1_vishal-shekhar-special-appearance-guitars|accessdate=15 May 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=29 February 2012|author=[[Mumbai Mirror]]}}</ref> Reviewing the soundtrack, Anand Vaishnav for [[India Times]] commented that, "''Kahaani'' as an album, stays honest to the theme of the film."<ref>{{cite news|last=Vaishnav|first=Anand|title=Music Review&nbsp;<U+2014> Kahaani|url=http://www.indiatimes.com/bollywood/music-review-kahaani-12663.html|accessdate=15 May 2012|newspaper=[[India Times]]|date=15 February 2012}}</ref>

== Marketing ==
''Kahaani's'' first look poster was launched on 2 December 2011,<ref>{{cite news|title=First Look: Vidya Balan in Kahaani|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/FIRST-LOOK-Vidya-Balan-in-Kahaani/Article1-776399.aspx|accessdate=4 May 2012|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=2 December 2011}}</ref> while the official trailer was launched on 5 January 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=First look of Vidya Balan's Kahaani launched|url=http://www.ndtv.com/video/player/news/first-look-of-vidya-balans-i-kahaani-i-launched/220329?sp|accessdate=4 May 2012|publisher=NDTV|date=5 January 2012}}</ref> The first look poster, portraying a pregnant Vidya Balan as the lead protagonist and with no romantic element, received a warm response from the public who expected it to be just a good film that might do a moderate business at the best. The critics also set their expectations low owing to the director's last two box office failures.<ref name="ibn rathnam 28march" />

=== Promotions ===
''Kahaani'' was extensively promoted in various cities across the country. Balan appeared in public with a prosthetic pregnant belly during promotional events of the film. She mingled with people in various public places, including railway stations, bus stands and [[Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport|BEST]] buses in Mumbai,<ref name=ZNpromotion>{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/celebrity/vidya-s-arnab-bagchi-found_107140.htm|title=Vidya's Arnab Bagchi found!|date=6 March 2012|accessdate=26 March 2012|publisher=Zee News}}</ref> and shopping malls in [[Ahmedabad]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Trivedi|first=Tanvi|title=Vidya Balan to promote 'Kahaani' in Ahmedabad|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-05/news-interviews/31123542_1_kahaani-vidya-balan-pregnant-woman|accessdate=9 April 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=5 Mar 2012|agency=TNN}}</ref> Along with a baby bump, she often carried a sketch of her missing husband; showing it to people and asking for their help in finding him.<ref name=ZNpromotion/> Besides, the film was promoted in Kolkata at several shopping malls and a metro station.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/ENT-publicity-zara-hatke-2983254.html|title=Publicity zara hatke!|last=Risbood|first=Vaibhavi|newspaper=[[Daily Bhaskar]]|date=16 March 202|accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref> On 3 March 2012, Balan, along with the director Ghosh and co-star Parambrata, urged the crowd at the [[Tollygunge]] Metro station to watch the film. She also presented gift hampers to the five top customers of the designer store, Jhoomar, at Allenby Road, as part of the Free Spirited Woman program launched by the store. The response to the campaign was overwhelming as residents from the neighboring houses peeped out of their windows to capture Balan on their cameras while school and college students waited outside with their notebooks for a glimpse of her. Later on the same day, Balan distributed ''Kahaani's'' music CDs, t-shirts and a leaflet with Arnab Bagchi's photograph at the Avani Riverside Mall in [[Howrah]] and requested the public to watch the film stating that its a story of Kolkata and had been shot on the streets of the city.<ref name="Vidya Story @ TT">{{cite news|title=Vidya's story|url=http://vv.telegraphindia.com/1120305/jsp/entertainment/story_15211741.jsp|accessdate=22 May 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=5 March 2012}}</ref>

On 8 March 2012, Balan appeared on Indian channel [[Colors (TV channel)|Colors']] daily soap ''[[Uttaran]]'' to promote the film. On the show, Balan dressed as her character Vidya Bagchi was seen sticking posters of her husband Arnab Bagchi as part of her relentless search for her missing husband and then interacting with the female lead of the show.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tv/Vidya-Balan-identifies-with-tv-actors-dilemma/articleshow/12083893.cms/|title=Vidya Balan identifies with tv actors dilemma|last=Vyavahare|first=Renuka|newspaper=The Times of India|date=21 March 2012|accessdate=21 March 2012|agency=TNN}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Tina's 'Uttaran' tales with Vidya's 'Kahaani'|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/idiotbox/tina-s-uttaran-tales-with-vidya-s-kahaani_106430.htm|accessdate=21 March 2012|publisher=Zee News|agency=IANS|date=23 February 2012}}</ref> The identity of the actor who played the role of Arnab Bagchi, was also not revealed to keep the mystery element alive.<ref name=ZNpromotion/>

=== Online game ===
As per the marketing strategy, the film was associated with [[Ibibo|Ibibo.com]] to develop an online based game on their social networking website. The game ''The Great Indian Parking Wars'', required the gamers to park Vidya's taxi on a friend's street to help her in the journey to find her missing husband. Gamers also got in touch with Balan through her gaming profile on the website and won movie merchandise and tickets. The game was a hit among online gamers reaching about 50,000 hits within the first 10 days of its launch.<ref>{{cite news|title=Vidya Balan's 'Kahaani' hit among online gamers|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/and-more/vidya-balan-s-kahaani-hit-among-online-gamers_107968.htm|accessdate=21 March 2012|publisher=Zee News|date=20 March 2012|agency=IANS}}</ref>

=== Controversy ===

On 5 March 2012, the [[Kolkata Metro]] Railway authorities objected to a scene from the film where Balan waits on the platform to board a Metro train at the [[Kalighat]] station and is pushed perilously by a man standing next to her onto the tracks, as soon as the train arrives. The railway officials requested the film's producer to remove the scene from the promos and the film, as it would remind people of the past acts of suicides on the tracks which tarnished the image of India's first tube railway. In the past, a total of 224 cases were registered for suicides of which 124 resulted in death.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kahaani's dream, Kolkata Metro's nightmare|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/kahaani-s-dream-kolkata-metro-s-nightmare_107035.htm|publisher=Zee News|agency=IANS|date=5 March 2012|accessdate=21 March 2012}}</ref> Following a discussion with the Metro authorities, the filmmakers submitted a video of the entire controversial scene to the authorities and explained to them of not including anything in the film that tarnished the image of the Metro railway or prompted people to commit suicide on the tracks. The railway officials were convinced and withdrew their objections and the scene which was shot using computer-generated imagery, was retained in the film but was however removed from the promos.<ref>{{cite news|title=Metro clears Vidya's scene in 'Kahaani'|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/metro-clears-vidya-s-scene-in-kahaani_107083.htm|publisher=Zee News|accessdate=21 March 2012|date=5 March 2012|agency=PTI}}</ref>

A special screening of the film was organized on 16 March 2012 in [[Bengaluru]] by [[Cinepolis#International|Cinepolis]] for the women of an NGO [[SOS Children's Villages]] that supports children and women from underprivileged families.

However, a number of reviewers criticized the climax and certain features of the film, feeling that they deviated from the general style of the film. Rituparna Chatterjee of CNN IBN noted that the climax of the film was a "huge dampener" and explained, "The diabolic twist at that juncture got underplayed by capitulating to what is crassly referred to as what the Indian audiences demand from a Hindi film. What follows is a sobfest, a repeat of a candle light vigil scene from Balan's earlier film ''No One Killed Jessica'' and the apologetic explanation of why she does what she does.

=== Box office ===
[[File:Vidya Balan at success bash of 'Kahaani'.jpg|thumb|right|230 px|Balan and Parambrata Chatterjee (r-l) celebrating the success of ''Kahaani''.]]

Though the film received critical acclaim, it was a slow starter at the box office, opening to a poor response on the first day<ref name="BO1">{{cite web|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/boxnewsdetail.php?page=shownews&articleid=4138&nCat=|title=Weekend Expectation|publisher=BoxOfficeIndia.Com|accessdate= 10 March 2012|date=10 March 2012}}</ref><ref name="BO2">{{cite web|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/npages.php?page=shownews&articleid=4129&nCat=|title=Kahaani to overtake Chaar Din Ki Chandni|publisher=BoxOfficeIndia.com|date=7 March 2012|accessdate=10 March 2012}}</ref> but gradually picking up by the end of its first week of theatrical run.

== Visuals and motifs ==
=== Portrayal of Kolkata ===
[[File:Traffic in Kolkata.jpg|thumb|left|A road in Kolkata showing congested traffic and yellow taxis]]
Some reviewers noted that a major protagonist in the film is the city of [[Kolkata]] itself, commenting that the director portrayed Kolkata as "brimming with warm, sympathetic inhabitants",<ref name="rediff Review"/> offering a multitude of glimpses of everyday life of the city.<ref name="rediff Review"/> As one review mentioned, "Ghosh pays a fond yet understated tribute to the city's essence and elements<U+2014>yellow taxis, leisurely trams, congested traffic, claustrophobic metros, dilapidated brick houses, tapering alleys, ''[[Polianthes tuberosa|rajnigandhas]]'', ''lal paad saris'', piping hot ''[[luchi]]s'' and a gorgeous depiction of how the city acquires a whole new level of luminosity and ''shakti'' during the famed [[Durga Puja]]." It was also noted that the film did not bank on the usual stereotypes of Kolkata culture often used in Bollywood films, such as "O-emphasizing accent, dramatic play of conch shells, ''[[rasgulla]]''/''[[mishti doi]]'' excesses."<ref name="rediff Review"/>

The visual portrayal of the city was praised by a critic, who stated, "Dark, lingering, soulful, amusing, festive, enigmatic and unchanging<U+2014>Kolkata is multiple people in a city's body. This varied, pulsating and intriguing temperament is what is documented in its yellow-toned frames without distracting itself from the story or its telling."<ref name="rediff Review"/> The director admitted, "For me, Kolkata wasn't supposed to be an object. Kolkata is a person and had an emotional index. When Parambrata drives down Vidya to the guest house for the first time, I deliberately show how the evening is slowly setting in. That's how my Kolkata enters every frame and finally becomes a central character of my film."<ref name="dasguptatoi152012">{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/news-interviews/Kahaani-takes-Kolkata-beyond-cliches/articleshow/12273109.cms|title='Kahaani' takes Kolkata beyond cliches|last=Dasgupta|first=Priyanka|newspaper=The Times of India|agency=TNN|date=15 March 2012|accessdate= 15 March 2012}}</ref>

However, certain cinematic experts argued that the portrayal of Kolkata in ''Kahaani'' was "cosmetic", akin to a [[Lonely Planet]] exotica,<ref name="gautaman gt 14-3-12"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-24/news-interviews/31233578_1_srijit-mukherji-films-shooting/3|title=Hemlock is far from a morbid film: Srijit Mukherji|newspaper=The Times of India|last=Ojha|first=Satadru|date=24 March 2012|accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref> and that it lacked a warranted, deep menacing presence.<ref name="mukherjee TT 4-12-12"/> The experts further said that the film was sometime s lacked subtlety, and that the depiction of the city never matched the level of [[Satyajit Ray]]'s [[Calcutta trilogy]]<U+2014>where "...aided by bloodshed, greed and decadence, ...Calcutta..., even though a place of dreams, desires and hope, slides irreversibly into chaos, anxiety and a moral crisis, taking its residents with it.".<ref name="mukherjee TT 4-12-12"/>

=== Allusions and inspirations ===
[[File:Pratima Visarjan by Gaganendranath Tagore.png|thumb|The colour scheme of ''Kahaani'' was inspired by the painting ''Pratima Visarjan'' by Gaganendranath Tagore.]]
Ghosh admitted to several instances of allusions to [[Satyajit Ray]]'s films. In one scene in the film, Vidya asks the manager of the guest house as to why there is no hot water in the tap although the signboard of the guest house claims "running hot water". The manager explains that the errand boy of the guest house runs to deliver hot water in a kettle whenever hot water is required, and that is why the signboard says "running hot water". Similarly, in Ray's ''[[Joy Baba Felunath]]'' (1979), an elderly gentleman asked the same question to a hotel manager, and got the same reply in a somewhat scalding manner.<ref name="anandabazreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.anandabazar.com/archive/1120317/17cine1.html|title=''Asamanya''|last=Bandyopadhyay|first=Jagari|date=17 March 2012|accessdate=18 March 2012|work=[[Anandabazar Patrika]]|language=Bengali|trans_title=Extraordinary}}</ref>

In an interview with [[Pratim D. Gupta]] of ''[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]'', Ghosh commented that the way Balan looks out and moves from window to window in the guest house room is reminiscent of ''[[Charulata]]'' (1964) where the actress [[Madhabi Mukherjee]], playing a lonely wife, enjoys glimpses of the outside world through the blinds of windows. He acknowledged the inspiration of [[Framing (visual arts)|framing]] of the visuals from ''[[Mahanagar]]'' (1963), another film directed by Ray noted for its portrayal of Kolkata. According to the director, he was inspired by particular scenes of Ray's ''[[Nayak (1966 film)|Nayak]]'' (1966) to plan the portrayal of complex emotional issues between Vidya and the police officer Rana, especially Rana's awe in the presence of Vidya. Ghosh expressed his inspiration from Ray's ''[[Aranyer Dinratri]]'' (1970) by saying, "I remember an interview of Ray's where he had said that in ''Aranyer Dinratri'' he wanted the audience to be inside the car with the four guys all the time. So the camera never leaves the car. It stuck in my head. The same thing I have done here. You are like Vidya's fellow passenger."<ref name="gupta ghosh interview tt">{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120314/jsp/entertainment/story_15245793.jsp|title=Salaam namaste: Sujoy Ghosh on the whys and whats of Kahaani and on being a jedi bangali|work=The Telegraph|date=14 March 2012|accessdate=18 March 2012|last=Gupta|first=Pratim D.}}</ref>

Besides Ray's films, Ghosh also admitted inspiration from the visually striking films of 1970s and 1980s, "I remember the scene in ''[[Deewaar (1975 film)|Deewaar]]'' when [[Shashi Kapoor]] walks in, sees [[Nirupa Roy]] and takes his cap off and she breaks her bangles. Nothing more, nothing less. Just images. I have used that here. Vidya comes down the stairs and sees Param standing there... he takes his cap off... just before the morgue scene."<ref name="gupta ghosh interview tt"/> Critics have also compared the fake pregnancy twist of ''Kahaani'' with similar sequences in the 2004 psychological thriller ''[[Taking Lives (film)|Taking Lives]]''.<ref name="anandabazreview"/> The sequences towards the end of the film that explains the missing pieces of the mystery were compared with a similar technique utilized in ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995).<ref name="choprahindustan"/> The director wrote that the film was heavily influenced by the colour scheme of the ''Pratima Visarjan'', a water colour painting by [[Gaganendranath Tagore]].<ref name="abp 7 april ghosh"/>

== Impact ==
=== Kolkata ===

The city of [[Kolkata]], has become a preferred destination for filmmakers in [[Bollywood]], following the critical and commercial success of the film. Ghosh commented that, "I am overwhelmed with the kind of interest Kolkata has generated among the people in Mumbai and elsewhere. It is Kolkata and not any other city which people are talking about now."<ref name=Kolkata_Limelight@ZN>{{cite news|title='Kahaani' brings Kolkata back to limelight|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/kahaani-brings-kolkata-back-to-limelight_107407.htm|accessdate=30 March 2012|publisher=Zee News|agency=PTI|date=11 March 2012}}</ref> Several film-makers have pointed that the landscape, streets and lanes of [[Mumbai]] and [[Delhi]] were overused in the films in the last few decades, while Kolkata, on the other hand, has a different appeal with its [[metro train]]s, rickety [[tram]]s, [[Pulled rickshaw|hand-pulled rickshaws]], dingy bylanes, British era buildings and iconic structures like [[Howrah Bridge]] and [[Victoria Memorial (India)|Victoria Memorial]]. [[National Film Awards|National Film Award]] winning producer-director [[Onir]], whose film ''[[I Am (2010 film)|I am]]'' (2010) was partially shot in the city, said that the present generation of Bengali filmmakers want to shoot at Kolkata, "Since we know the city very well and have many memories attached to the place, the ideas flow in very easily while shooting in Kolkata."<ref name=Kolkata_Limelight@ZN/> Director [[Anurag Basu]], whose film ''[[Barfee]]'' was shot in Kolkata for over a month stated, "If I look from the eyes of the camera all other metros look the same but Kolkata has a unique character."<ref name=Kolkata_Limelight@ZN/> [[National Film Award for Best Actress|National Award]] winner [[Rituparna Sengupta]] commented, "From foreign locations, the films have shifted their focus to Indian culture and ''Kahaani'' is one of the examples where we saw the filmmaker looking at [[West Bengal]] for inspiration."<ref>{{cite news|title=Delighted to see filmmakers reviving Bengali culture: Rituparna|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-31/news-interviews/31266331_1_bengali-culture-hindi-film-hindi-movie|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=31 Mar 2012|agency=IANS}}</ref>

Once considered as the hub of art, culture and literature, Kolkata lost its dominance and presence in [[Indian Cinema]] after the death of renowned city-based filmmakers [[Bimal Roy]] and [[Pramathesh Barua]].<ref name=Kolkata_Limelight@ZN /> Since shooting for a [[Hindi language|Hindi]] film was not natural in a city dominated by [[Bengali language|Bengali]], Mumbai took over as a recurrent location in most of the films due to the presence of the Hindi film industry in Mumbai. Bengali filmmakers [[Aparna Sen]] and [[Rituparno Ghosh]] had in the past made films like ''[[36 Chowringhee Lane]]'' and the [[Amitabh Bachchan]] starrer ''[[The Last Lear]]'' where Kolkata featured prominently in the background. Two of [[Vidya Balan|Balan's]] previous films<U+2014>''[[Bhalo Theko]]'' (her cinematic debut) and ''[[Parineeta (2005 film)|Parineeta]]'' (2005) (her [[Bollywood]] debut), were also primarily shot in Kolkata.<ref name=Kolkata_Limelight@ZN /> With the city's increasing cosmopolitan culture and the Victorian aura still intact in some places, film-makers believe that the city also stands to benefit from the trend, stating the example of [[Switzerland]] which became an attractive tourist destination for Indian Cinema after [[Yash Chopra]] captured the locales of the snow-capped mountains in his films.<ref name=Kolkata_Limelight@ZN />

=== Monalisa Guest House ===

Monalisa Guest House, the tourist lodge which played host to a pregnant Vidya Bagchi in the film, became a tourist spot among the local crowd.<ref>{{cite news|title=Single screen theatres resurface to tell Vidya's Kahaani|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/Single-screen-theatres-resurface-to-tell-Vidya-s-Kahaani/Article1-835430.aspx|accessdate=5 April 2012|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=4 April 2012|agency=IANS}}</ref> The place, situated on [[Sarat Bose Road]] in the [[South Kolkata|southern part of the city]], attracted hundreds of visitors since the release of the film. While around 50<U+2013>60 visitors thronged the place daily to catch a glimpse of room number 15, where Balan stayed, the lodge witnessed the maximum crowd of about 300 people on 18 March 2012. According to the management, the film's release has increased the occupancy rate of the hotel from the previous 70 percent to 90 percent and many visitors left disheartened since the room where Balan stayed remained occupied after the film's release. Room number 15 is the only "suite" in the lodge with the highest per-day tariff of {{INRConvert|2|k}} while the other rooms ranges between {{INRConvert|980}} and {{INRConvert|1650}} per day. The management further stated that contrary to the old-fashioned look in the film, the rooms in the guest house are well equipped with basic modern facilities along with a computerized registration system to keep the records of the visitors, unlike the "thick and torn register" shown in the film. They added that the "running hot water" actually referred to the water heaters installed in the rooms and does not mean a boy supplying hot water in a kettle, as depicted in the film. Banking on the high demand and also with ''Kahaani'' as the [[Unique selling proposition|USP]] for the hotel, the hotel planned to increase the per-day tariffs by renovating the rooms with modern furniture and some photographs from the film.<ref name="StarChamber">{{cite news|title=Star chamber|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/star-chamber/468894/|accessdate=26 March 2012|newspaper=Business Standard|date=25 March 2012|first=Probal|last=Basak}}</ref>

== Sequel and remakes ==

At a special screening held for the film's cast and crew in Kolkata on 10 March 2012, Sujoy Ghosh admitted to his intentions of continuing the film as a part of an ongoing series. Ghosh was inspired by [[Satyajit Ray]]'s ''[[Feluda]]'' detective stories and desired to carry forward the stories of Vidya Bagchi on similar lines. He said, "... I knew I had stumbled on to a unique idea that I didn't want to let go of when I finished writing ''Kahaani''. What Vidya Bagchi does with her life after my ''Kahaani'', haunts me. I want to take the idea forward."<ref name="Jha franchise">{{cite news|first=Subhash K.|last= Jha|title=Kahaani to be a franchise?|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-16/news-interviews/31200857_1_sujoy-ghosh-s-kahaani-vidya-balan-franchise|accessdate=27 March 2012|newspaper= The Times of India|date=16 March 2012}}</ref> The positive critical reception and box office collection of the film strengthened the likelihood of a sequel. Ghosh further said, "''Kahaani'' was written for Balan. I can't imagine taking the character forward without her. She will have to green-light the franchise before it goes further."<ref name="Jha franchise"/>
