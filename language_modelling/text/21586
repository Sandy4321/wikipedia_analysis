The '''common dolphin''' is the name given to two species (and possibly a third) of [[dolphin]] making up the [[genus]] '''''Delphinus'''''.

Prior to the mid-1990s, most [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] only recognised one species in this genus, the common dolphin ''Delphinus delphis''. Modern [[cetologists]] usually recognise two species&nbsp;<U+2014> the [[short-beaked common dolphin]], which retains the systematic name ''Delphinus delphis'', and the [[long-beaked common dolphin]] ''Delphinus capensis''.

The '''common dolphin''' is not the dolphin of popular imagination despite its name; that distinction belongs to the [[bottlenose dolphin]] due to its widespread use in marine parks and its appearance in the [[television series]] ''[[Flipper (1964 TV series)|Flipper]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=American Cetacean Society&nbsp;<U+2014> Bottlenose Dolphin|url=http://www.acsonline.org/factpack/btlnose.htm|accessdate=2008-08-31|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080725121057/http://acsonline.org/factpack/btlnose.htm <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=2008-07-25}}</ref>  However, this dolphin was the most frequently represented in the art and literature of ancient Greece and Rome.<ref>Watson, L.  (1981).  Sea Guide to Whales of the World. p270.  ISBN 0-17-601535-3.</ref>

==Physical characteristics==
Both common dolphin species are medium-sized; adults range between {{convert|1.9|and|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, and can weigh between {{convert|80|and|235|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, although the range between {{convert|80|and|150|kg|lb|abbr=on}} is more common.<ref name=princeton>{{cite book|title=Whales, Dolphins and Other Marine Mammals of the World|author=Shirihai, H. & Jarrett, B.|year=2006|pages=174<U+2013>176|isbn=0-691-12757-3}}</ref>  Males are generally longer and heavier.<ref name=princeton/>  The color pattern on the body is unusual.  The back is dark and the belly is white, while on each side is an [[hourglass]] pattern colored light grey, yellow, or gold in front and dirty grey in back.<ref name=Audubon>{{cite book|title=Guide to Marine Mammals of the World|author=Reeves, Stewart, Clapham, Powell|page=388|isbn=0-375-41141-0}}</ref>  They have  long, thin rostra with up to 50<U+2013>60 small, sharp, interlocking teeth on each side of each jaw.<ref name="TheCommon">{{cite web|title=The Common Dolphin|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/17963/genus-Delphinus.html|accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref>

==Differentiating species==
[[File:Common Dolphin.jpg|thumb|left|Common dolphin, Ireland]]
Despite the historic practice of lumping the entire ''Delphinus'' genus into a single species, these widely distributed dolphins exhibit a wide variety of sizes, shapes and colors. Indeed, over the past few decades, over 20 distinct species in the genus have been proposed. Scientists in California in the 1960s concluded there were two species&nbsp;<U+2014> the long-beaked and short-beaked. This analysis was essentially confirmed by a more in-depth [[genetic study]] in the 1990s. This study also suggested a third species (''D. tropicalis'', common name usually '''Arabian common dolphin'''), characterized by an extremely long and thin beak and found in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, might be distinguished from the long-beaked species. The current standard [[taxonomic]] works recognize this as just a regional variety. '''D. tropicalis''' is a subspecies of '''D. capensis'''.

==Natural history==
[[File:CD 3.jpg|thumb|left|Common dolphin, Ireland]]
Common dolphins live in both warm-temperate and tropical waters ranging from [[40th parallel north|40]]<U+2013>[[60th parallel north|60<U+00B0>N]] to [[50th parallel south|50<U+00B0>S]]. Long-beaked common dolphins mostly inhabit shallow, warm costal water.<ref name=encyc/> Short-beaked common dolphins are common "along shelf edges and in areas with sharp bottom relief such as [[seamount]]s and [[escarpment]]s".<ref name="Audubon"/> Common dolphin have a varied diet consisting of many species of fish and squid. This includes both [[mesopelagic]] species and [[epipelagic]] schooling species. They have been recorded to make dives up to {{Convert|200|m|ft}} deep.

Common dolphins can live in aggregations of hundreds or even thousands of dolphins.<ref name=encyc>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals|author=Perrin, W.|chapter=Common Dolphins|editor=Perrin, W.; Wursig, B. and Thewissen, J.|pages=245<U+2013>248|year=2002|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=0-12-551340-2}}</ref>  They sometimes associate with other dolphin species, such as [[pilot whale]]s.<ref name=encyc/>  They have also been observed bow riding on [[baleen whale]]s, and they also bow ride on boats.<ref name=encyc/> They are fast swimmers (up to 60&nbsp;km/h), and [[Whale surfacing behaviour|breaching]] behavior and aerial acrobatics are common with this species.<ref name=princeton>{{cite book|title=Whales, Dolphins and Other Marine Mammals of the World|author=Shirihai, H. & Jarrett, B.|year=2006|pages=171<U+2013>174|isbn=0-691-12757-3}}</ref> They are also known to display altruistic behaviors to support injured members.<ref>Walker M., 2013.

===Conservation===
[[File:Common Dolphin of genus Delphinus.jpg|thumb|A [[Common Dolphin]] jumping off [[Morro Bay State Marine Recreational Management Area and Morro Bay State Marine Reserve|Morro Bay Nature Reserve]]]]
Common dolphins face a mixture of threats due to human influence. Moderate levels of metal pollutants, which are thought to negatively impact dolphin health,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Lavery, T.

In most other areas, the dolphins have not been hunted directly. Several thousand individuals have been caught in industrial trawler nets throughout their range. Common dolphins were abundant in the western Mediterranean Sea until the 1960s but occurrences there have tailed off rapidly. The reasons are not well understood, but are believed to be due to extensive human activity in the area. In the US, they are a protected species and sometimes are caught by accident in some trawler nets as bycatch, though despite this they are still quite common throughout their range. Despite these potential threats, the short-beaked common dolphin is considered to be Least Concern by the [[IUCN]] Red List, and the long-beaked common dolphin is listed as Data Deficient.<ref name=iucn>{{IUCN2008|assessors=Hammond, P.S., Bearzi, G., Bj<U+00F8>rge, A., Forney, K., Karczmarski, L., Kasuya, T., Perrin, W.F., Scott, M.D., Wang, J.Y., Wells, R.S. & Wilson, B.|year=2008|id=6336|title=Delphinus delphis|downloaded=7 October 2008}}</ref>

The short-beaked common dolphin ''Delphinus delphis'' is listed globally on Appendix II<ref name="Appendices">[http://web.archive.org/web/20110611112003/http://www.cms.int/documents/appendix/Appendices_COP9_E.pdf Appendices I and II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS)]. effective 5 March 2009</ref> of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS).<ref>[http://www.cms.int/reports/small_cetaceans/data/d_delphis/d_delphis.htm Convention on Migratory Species page on the Short-beaked common dolphin].

===Captivity===
Common dolphins are not common in captivity. But on at least three occasions, a beached common dolphin in California was nursed back to health at [[SeaWorld San Diego]], but deemed unfit to release back to the ocean. These common dolphins remained at SeaWorld with the bottlenose dolphin exhibit. On one occasion, a male common dolphin managed to impregnate one of the female bottlenose dolphins in the exhibit, leading to four hybrid births.<ref name=hybrid>{{cite journal|title=Captive-born bottlenose dolphin <U+00D7> common dolphin (''Tursiops truncatus'' <U+00D7> ''Delphinus capensis'') intergeneric hybrids|author=Zornetzer H.R.; Duffield D.A.|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology |volume=81 |issue=10 |pages=1755<U+2013>1762 |date=October 1, 2003|doi=10.1139/z03-150}}</ref> One of the resulting common dolphin/bottlenose dolphin hybrids remained at SeaWorld, San Diego (alternately under the name Cindy or Bullet) while the other was kept at [[Discovery Cove]]. They also participate in shows with bottlenose dolphin and pilot whale at Sea World.

Other than at SeaWorld, at least 90 common dolphins are known to have been captured from the wild and kept in captivity. Captured common dolphins are said to be difficult to keep in captivity.<ref name="TheCommon" />
