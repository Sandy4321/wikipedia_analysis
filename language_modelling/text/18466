'''A Douka''' is an ethical Japanese Tanka (poetry) with a lesson. Well-versed poems of Douka contain the central dogma, appealing to Japanese people and easy to memorize. 
==Douka and its popularity in Japanese culture==
<ref>Kimura[1998:441-445]</ref>
There is a wide range of Douka and its contents are said to cover not only lessons but also worldly wisdom. The writers of Douka<U+3000>are recorded to be many, but some of them composed originally [[Tanka]] and their Tanka was interpreted by others as Douka. 
===Writers of Douka===
[[Ninomiya Sontoku]], [[Ikkyu]], [[Arakida Moritake]], [[Ito Jinsai]], [[Muso Soseki]], [[Shimazu Tadayoshi]], [[Ota Nampo]], [[Matsudaira Sadanobu]], [[Tokugawa Mitsukuni]],[[Yoshida Shoin]], [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]], [[Takuan]], [[Takizawa Bakin]], [[Hirata Atsutane]], [[Ota Dokan]], [[Saigyo Hoshi]], [[Kyokutei Bakin]], [[Yamaoka Tesshu]], [[Watanabe Kazan]], [[Yamanoue no Okura]], [[Fujiwara Teika]], [[Sen no Rikyu]], [[Sakamoto Ryoma]], [[Toju Nakae]], [[Rennyo]], [[Minamoto no Sanetomo]], [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]], [[Takuan Soho]], [[Sugawara Michizane]], [[Nichiren]], [[Honinbo Sansa]] [[Motoori Norinaga]] and many others.

==History of Douka==
*[[Anrakuan Sakuden]] (<U+5B89><U+697D><U+5EB5><U+7B56><U+4F1D>?, 1554 - February 7, 1642) was an Edo period Japanese priest of the [[Jodo-shu ]] (Pure Land) of Buddhism; and a poet. He wrote a book Seisuisho (<U+9192><U+7761><U+7B11>, Laughs to Wake You Up), which is a collection of humorous anecdotes. In volume 3 of this book, the word Douka was first used. <ref>Kimura[1998:preface]</ref>However, the Japanese have liked composing Tankas with lessons from time immemorial. Later, Ishida Baigan started [[Shingaku]] (<U+5FC3><U+5B66>, lit. "heart learning") and used Douka in his religious movement. Douka is remembered in everyday life of Japanese.

Translation:
:[[Shinran]] was determined to enter the  Buddihst priesthood.  Cherry blossoms were in full blossom. It was in the evening and his senior monk said the ceremony would be made on the next day. Shinran made the following Tanka which meant that it should be made right now; if otherwise, on the following night, a typhoon might blow and I might die, or I might change my mind. 
:If you put your mind to it, you can do it;If you do not, you cannot -- that is true for all things. When something cannot be done, you are the one to blame For not putting your heart into it.[[Uesugi Yozan]]
:You should do it yourself before him, you should tell him to do it, you should let him hear it, you should let him do it, and you should praise him, then, you let him do it. [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] 
:You must be prepared to sacrifice yourself, then you will find a way, when you meet difficulties.[[Kuya]]
:You have plenty of time playing something. You are not reading books saying you have no time. Why ? (Reading  books is recommended)([[Motoori Norinaga]])<ref>Yanami[1936:194]</ref>
:The rumor that that person and I are in love is groundless, but what should I answer, if the question is to my conscience. (Unknown composer in Gosenshu)<ref>Yanami[1936:16]</ref>
:Your conscience is little by little benumbed without you knowing it. (Unknown composer)<ref>Yanami[1936:187]</ref>

:Don't bear a grudge against [[Kami]]. Wait some more time, and you will find fortune. ([[Kami]] of [[Kumano Shrine]] in Gyokuyo Wakashu)<ref>Yanami[1936:36]</ref>

:The heart with which one educates other persons is the same which educates myself. Learn by teaching someone else. (Moritake Araida from Yononaka Hyakushu)<ref>Yanami[1936:147]</ref>

:Someone who reminds you of your defects is precious, regardless of the position of the adviser. (Unknown composer)<ref>Yanami[1936:206]</ref>
