The '''Republican Party''', commonly referred to as the '''GOP''' (abbreviation for '''Grand Old Party'''), is one of the two major contemporary [[political parties in the United States]], the other being its historic rival the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

Founded by anti-slavery activists in 1854, the GOP dominated politics nationally and in most of the North for most of the period from 1860 to 1932. There have been 18 Republican presidents, the first being [[Abraham Lincoln]], who served from 1861 until his [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassination]] in 1865, and the most recent being [[George W. Bush]], who served two full four-year terms 2001 to 2009. The most recent Republican presidential nominee was former [[Massachusetts]] [[Governor of Massachusetts|governor]] [[Mitt Romney]] who lost in 2012.

==History==
{{Main|History of the United States Republican Party}}

===Founding and 19th century===
[[File:Abraham Lincoln head on shoulders photo portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Abraham Lincoln]], the first Republican U.S. President (1861<U+2013>1865).]]

Founded in the Northern states in 1854 by anti-slavery activists, modernizers, ex-[[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], and ex-[[Free Soil]]ers, the Republican Party quickly became the principal opposition to the dominant [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the briefly popular [[Know Nothing|Know Nothing Party]]. The main cause was opposition to the [[Kansas<U+2013>Nebraska Act]], which repealed the [[Missouri Compromise]] by which slavery was kept out of Kansas. The Northern Republicans saw the expansion of slavery as a great evil. The first public meeting where the name "Republican" was suggested for a new anti-slavery party was held on March 20, 1854 in a schoolhouse in [[Ripon, Wisconsin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/tp&CISOPTR=46379&CISOSHOW=46363 |title=''The Origin of the Republican Party'', A. F. Gilman, Ripon College, 1914 |publisher=Content.wisconsinhistory.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-17}}</ref> The name was partly chosen to pay homage to [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Democratic-Republican Party|Republican Party]].

The first official party convention was held on July 6, 1854, in [[Jackson, Michigan]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Birth of Republicanism |date=July 7, 1879 |newspaper=The New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A06E5D81E3FE63BBC4F53DFB1668382669FDE |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> By 1858, the Republicans dominated nearly all Northern states. The Republican Party first came to power in 1860 with the election of Lincoln to the Presidency and Republicans in control of Congress and again, the Northern states. It oversaw the preserving of the union, the end of slavery, and the provision of equal rights to all men in the [[American Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], 1861<U+2013>1877.<ref name=Gould2003>Gould</ref>

The Republicans' initial base was in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and the upper [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. With the [[Realigning election|realignment]] of parties and voters in the [[Third Party System]], the strong run of [[John&nbsp;C. Fremont]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1856|1856 Presidential election]] demonstrated it dominated most northern states.

Early Republican ideology was reflected in the 1856 slogan "free labor, free land, free men", which had been coined by [[Salmon&nbsp;P. Chase]], a Senator from Ohio (and future [[Secretary of the Treasury]] and [[Chief Justice of the United States]]).<ref name=Gienapp1989>{{cite book |last=Gienapp|first=W|title=The Origins of the Republican Party|page=168|publisher=|location=|year=1989|url=}}</ref> "Free labor" referred to the Republican opposition to slave labor and belief in independent artisans and businessmen. "Free land" referred to Republican opposition to plantation system whereby slaveowners could buy up all the good farm land, leaving the [[yeoman]] independent farmers the leftovers. The Party strived to contain the expansion of slavery, which would cause the collapse of the [[slave power]] and the expansion of freedom.<ref name=Foner>{{cite web |author=|title=Free soil, free labor, free men|work=|publisher=|location=|year=1970|url=|accessdate=2011-09-05}}</ref>

Lincoln, representing the fast-growing western states, won the Republican nomination in 1860 and subsequently won the presidency. The party took on the mission of preserving the Union and destroying slavery during the American Civil War and over [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. In the [[United States presidential election, 1864|election of 1864]], it united with [[War Democrats]] to nominate Lincoln on the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]] ticket.

The party's success created factionalism within the party in the 1870s. Those who felt that Reconstruction had been accomplished and was continued mostly to promote the large-scale corruption tolerated by President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] ran [[Horace Greeley]] for the presidency. The Stalwarts defended Grant and the [[spoils system]]; the [[Half-Breed (politics)|Half-Breeds]] pushed for reform of the [[civil service]].

The GOP supported business generally, hard money (i.e.,&nbsp;the [[gold standard]]), [[Tariffs in American history|high tariffs to promote economic growth, high wages and high profits]], generous pensions for Union veterans, and (after&nbsp;1893) the annexation of [[Hawaii]]. The Republicans supported the [[Pietism|pietistic]] Protestants who demanded [[Prohibition]]. As the northern post-bellum economy boomed with heavy and light industry, railroads, mines, fast-growing cities and prosperous agriculture, the Republicans took credit and promoted policies to sustain the fast growth.

Nevertheless, by 1890 the Republicans had agreed to the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] and the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] in response to complaints from owners of small businesses and farmers. The high [[McKinley Tariff]] of 1890 hurt the party and the Democrats swept to a landslide in the off-year elections, even defeating McKinley himself.

After the two terms of Democrat [[Grover Cleveland]], the election of [[William McKinley]] in [[United States presidential election, 1896|1896]] is widely seen as a resurgence of Republican dominance and is sometimes cited as a [[realigning election]]. McKinley promised that high tariffs would end the severe hardship caused by the [[Panic of 1893]], and that the GOP would guarantee a sort of pluralism in which all groups would benefit.

===20th century===
[[File:President Theodore Roosevelt, 1904.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[List of Presidents of the United States|26th]] President of the United States (1901<U+2013>1909)]]
The 1896 realignment cemented the GOP as the party of big business, while [[Theodore Roosevelt]] added more small business support by his embrace of [[trust busting]]. He handpicked his successor [[William Howard Taft]] in 1908, but they became enemies on economic issues. Defeated by Taft for the 1912 nomination, Roosevelt bolted the party and led the third party ticket of the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]]. The party returned to the White House throughout the 1920s, running on platforms of normalcy, business-oriented efficiency, and high tariffs. The national party avoided the prohibition issue after it became law in 1920.

[[Warren G. Harding]], [[Calvin Coolidge]] and [[Herbert Hoover]] were resoundingly elected in [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920]], [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924]], and [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928]] respectively. The [[Teapot Dome scandal]] threatened to hurt the party but Harding died and Coolidge blamed everything on him, as the opposition splintered in 1924. The pro-business policies of the decade seemed to produce an unprecedented prosperity until the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] heralded the [[Great Depression]].

===New Deal Era===
{{main|Old Right (United States)|Fifth Party System|History of the United States Republican Party#Fighting the New Deal Coalition: 1932<U+2013>1980}}
[[File:Dwight D. Eisenhower, official photo portrait, May 29, 1959.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Dwight Eisenhower]], [[List of Presidents of the United States|34th]] President of the United States (1953<U+2013>1961)]]The [[New Deal coalition]] of Democrat Franklin&nbsp;D. Roosevelt controlled American politics for most of the next three decades, excepting the two-term presidency of Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Blacks moved into the Democratic Party during the [[New Deal]] era; they could vote in the North but not in the South. After Roosevelt took office in 1933, [[New Deal]] legislation sailed through Congress and the economic moved sharply upward from the nadir in early 1933. However long-term unemployment remained a drag until 1940. In the 1934 midterm elections, 10 Republican senators went down to defeat, leaving them with only 25 against 71 Democrats. The House of Representatives likewise had overwhelming Democratic majorities.

The GOP split into a majority "Old Right" (based in the Midwest) and a liberal wing based in the Northeast that supported much of the New Deal. The Old Right sharply attacked the "Second New Deal" and said it represented class warfare and socialism. Roosevelt was reelected in a landslide in 1936 but everything went awry in his second term, as the economy plunged, strikes soared, and FDR failed to take control of the Supreme Court or to purge the Southern conservatives in the Democratic party. The GOP made a major comeback [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1938|in the 1938 elections]], and had new rising stars such as [[Robert A. Taft]] of Ohio on the right and [[Thomas E. Dewey]] of New York on the left.<ref>Milton Plesur, "The Republican Congressional Comeback of 1938", ''Review of Politics'' (1962) 24#4 pp:525<U+2013>562 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1405361 in JSTOR]</ref> Southern conservatives joined with most Republicans to form the [[conservative coalition]], which dominated domestic issues in Congress until 1964. Both parties split on foreign policy issues, with the anti-war isolationists dominant in the GOP and the interventionists who wanted to stop Hitler dominant in the Democratic party. Roosevelt won a third and fourth term in 1940 and 1944. Conservatives abolished most of the New Deal during the war, but did not attempt to reverse Social Security or the agencies that regulated business.

Historian [[George H. Nash]] argues:
:Unlike the "moderate", internationalist, largely eastern bloc of Republicans who accepted (or at least acquiesced in) some of the "Roosevelt Revolution" and the essential premises of President Truman's foreign policy, the Republican Right at heart was counterrevolutionary, anticollectivist, anti-Communist, anti-New Deal, passionately committed to limited government, free market economics, and congressional (as opposed to executive) prerogatives, the G.O.P. conservatives were obliged from the start to wage a constant two-front war: against liberal Democrats from without and "me-too" Republicans from within.<ref>George H. Nash, "The Republican Right from Taft to Reagan", ''Reviews in American History'' (1984) 12#2 pp 261<U+2013>265 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2702450 in JSTOR] quote on p. 261; Nash references David W. Reinhard, ''The Republican Right since 1945'', (University Press of Kentucky, 1983)</ref>

The Democrats elected majorities to Congress almost continuously after 1932 (the GOP won only in 1946 and 1952), but the Conservative Coalition blocked practically all major liberal proposals in domestic policy. After 1945, the internationalist wing of the GOP cooperated with Harry Truman's [[Cold War]] foreign policy, funded the [[Marshall Plan]], and supported NATO, despite the continued isolationism of the Old Right.

[[File:Richard M. Nixon, ca. 1935 - 1982 - NARA - 530679.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Richard Nixon]], [[List of Presidents of the United States|37th]] President of the United States (1969<U+2013>1974)]]
[[File:Official Portrait of President Reagan 1981.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ronald Reagan]], [[List of Presidents of the United States|40th]] President of the United States (1981<U+2013>1989)]]
The second half of the 20th century saw election or succession of Republican presidents [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]]. Eisenhower had defeated conservative leader Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] for the 1952 nomination, but conservatives dominated the domestic policies of the Eisenhower Administration. Voters liked Ike much more than they liked the GOP, and he proved unable to shift the party to a more moderate position. After 1970, the liberal wing faded away.<ref name="Nicol C. Rae 1989">Nicol C. Rae, ''The Decline and Fall of the Liberal Republicans: From 1952 to the Present'' (1989)</ref>

Ever since he left office in 1989, Reagan has been the iconic Republican; and Republican presidential candidates frequently claim to share his views and aim to establish themselves and their policies as the more appropriate heir to his legacy.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Priscilla Walton|author2=Bruce Tucker|title=American Culture Transformed: Dialing 9/11|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jbU2mBCgfXkC&pg=PA133|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=133<U+2013>36}}</ref> In 1994, the Party, led by House Minority Whip [[Newt Gingrich]] campaigning on the ''[[Contract with America]]'', was elected to majorities to both houses of Congress in the [[Republican Revolution]]. However Gingrich was unable to deliver on most of its promises, and after his failure to successfully impeach President Bill Clinton in 1998, he resigned. Since Reagan's day, presidential elections have been close. However the Republican presidential candidate won a majority of the popular vote only in 2004, while coming in second in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2008 and 2012.

===21st century===
The Senate majority lasted until 2001, when the Senate became split evenly but was regained in the 2002 elections. Both Republican majorities in the House and Senate were held until the Democrats regained control in the [[United States elections, 2006|mid-term elections of 2006]]. The Republican Party has since been defined by [[Social conservatism in the United States|social conservatism]], a [[preemptive war]] foreign policy intended to defeat terrorism and promote global democracy, a more powerful [[Executive (government)|executive branch]], [[supply side economics]], support for gun ownership, and deregulation.

In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|Presidential election of 2008]], the party's nominees were Senator [[John McCain]], of Arizona, for President and Alaska Governor [[Sarah Palin]] for Vice President. They were defeated by Senator [[Barack Obama]] of Illinois and Senator [[Joe Biden]] of Delaware. In 2009, Republicans [[Chris Christie]] and [[Bob McDonnell]] were elected to the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia.

2010 was a year of electoral success for the Republicans, starting with the upset win of [[Scott Brown]] in the Massachusetts special Senate election for the seat held for many decades by the Democratic Kennedy brothers. In the [[United States elections, 2010|November elections]], Republicans recaptured control of the House, increased their number of seats in the Senate, and gained a majority of governorships.<ref>Donald T. Critchlow, ''The Conservative Ascendancy: How the Republican Right Rose to Power in Modern America'' (2011) pp 280<U+2013>312</ref> Additionally, Republicans took control of at least 19 Democratic-controlled state legislatures.<ref>Khan. Huma. [http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-historic-win-state-legislatures-vote-2010-election/story?id=12049040#.T4eD_NnhdeM Will Redistricting Be a Bloodbath for Democrats?]. ABCNews.com. 2010-11-04. Retrieved 2012-04-13.</ref>

In the [[United States presidential election, 2012|Presidential election of 2012]], the Republican nominees were former Governor [[Mitt Romney]] of Massachusetts for President, and Representative [[Paul Ryan]] of Wisconsin for Vice President. The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] nominated incumbents [[Barack Obama]] and [[Joe Biden]]. The campaign focused largely on the Affordable Care Act and President Obama's stewardship of the economy, with the country facing high unemployment numbers and a rising national debt four years after his first election. Romney and Ryan were defeated by Obama and Biden. In addition, in the [[United States elections, 2012|November congressional elections]], while Republicans lost 7 seats in the House, they retained control. However, Republicans were not able to gain control of the Senate, continuing their minority status with a net loss of 2 seats.

By September 2014 the GOP was confident of making gains in the November election and perhaps taking control of the Senate by gaining six seats.<ref>A gain of only five seats would have led to a tie, which would have been broken by Vice President Joe Biden, a Democrat.</ref><ref>Anthony Salvanto, Doug Rivers, Andy Guess, "Republicans keep edge in latest Senate midterm estimate", [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/republicans-keep-edge-in-latest-senate-midterm-estimate/CBS News September 7, 2014]</ref>

The 2016 presidential campaign was already underway as ''The Wall Street Journal'' in September 2014 handicapped the dozen or so most prominently mentioned GOP "wannabes" or potential candidates. Two are policy wonks. Representative Paul Ryan focuses on economic policies. Senator [[Marco Rubio]] has dropped his previous emphasis on immigration issues, but has issued a long series of position papers on domestic and foreign policy. Two elder statesmen are waiting in the wings: former governor [[Jeb Bush]], and 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney. Two potential nominees are engaged in late 2014 in rebuilding their reputation after serious mishaps: governors [[Chris Christie]], and [[Rick Perry]]. Senator Ted Cruz is appealing to the most conservative elements by taking the position furthest to the right on economic, social, and national security issues. Three other governors are running as outsiders: [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]], [[Bobby Jindall]], and [[Mike Pence]]. Senator [[Rob Portman]] and former Senator [[Rick Santorum]] are long-shots. A unique position is held by Senator [[Rand Paul]], with his distinctive strongly libertarian appeals on economics, foreign policy, and social issues.<ref>Gerald F. Seib, "How the 2016 GOP Wannabes Spent Summer", ''The Wall Street Journal'', September 2, 2014.</ref>

The party's founding members chose the name "Republican Party" in the mid-1850s as homage to the values of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] promoted by [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s Republican party.<ref name=Rutland>{{cite book |last=Rutland|first=RA|title=The Republicans: From Lincoln to Bush| publisher=|location=|year=1996|page=2|isbn=0-8262-1090-2}}</ref> The idea for the name came from an editorial by the party's leading publicist Horace Greeley, who called for, "some simple name like 'Republican' [that] would more fitly designate those who had united to restore the Union to its true mission of champion and promulgator of Liberty rather than propagandist of slavery".<ref name=ushistory>{{cite web |author=ushistory.org |url=http://www.ushistory.org/gop/origins.htm |title=The Origins of the Republican Party |publisher=Ushistory.org |date=1995-07-04 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> The name reflects the 1776 [[Republicanism in the United States|republican]] values of civic virtue and opposition to aristocracy and corruption.<ref name=Gould2003p14>Gould, pp. 14<U+2013>15</ref>

The term "Grand Old Party" is a traditional nickname for the Republican Party, and the abbreviation "GOP" is a commonly used designation. The term originated in 1875 in the ''Congressional Record'', referring to the party associated with the successful military defense of the Union as "this gallant old party"; the following year in an article in the ''[[Cincinnati Commercial Tribune|Cincinnati Commercial]]'', the term was modified to "grand old party". The first use of the abbreviation is dated 1884.<ref>"Grand Old Party", ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''</ref>

The traditional mascot of the party is the elephant. A political cartoon by [[Thomas Nast]], published in ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's Weekly]]'' on November 7, 1874, is considered the first important use of the symbol.<ref name=harpweek20031107>[http://www.harpweek.com/09Cartoon/BrowseByDateCartoon.asp?Year=2003&Month=November&Date=7 Cartoon of the Day: "The Third-Term Panic"]. Retrieved on 2007-02-21.</ref> In the early 20th century, the usual symbol of the Republican Party in Midwestern states such as [[Indiana]] and [[Ohio]] was the bald eagle, as opposed to the Democratic rooster.

After the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]], the color [[political color|red became associated]] with the GOP, although the party has not officially adopted it. That election night, for the first time, all of the major broadcast networks used the same color scheme for the electoral map: states won by Republican nominee George W. Bush were colored red, and states won by Democratic nominee [[Al Gore]] were colored blue. Although the assignment of colors to political parties is unofficial and informal, they have come to be widely recognized by the media to represent the respective political parties.

==Structure and composition==
{{further2|[[Politics of the United States#Organization of American political parties]]}}
The [[Republican National Committee]] (RNC) is responsible for promoting Republican campaign activities. It is responsible for developing and promoting the Republican political platform, as well as coordinating fundraising and election strategy. Its current chairman is [[Reince Priebus]]. The chairman of the RNC is chosen by the President when the Republicans have the White House or otherwise by the Party's state committees.

The RNC, under the direction of the party's presidential candidate, supervises the [[Republican National Convention]] and raises funds for candidates. On the local level, there are similar state committees in every state and most large cities, counties and legislative districts, but they have far less money and influence than the national body.

The Republican House and Senate caucuses have separate fundraising and strategy committees. The [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] (NRCC) assists in House races, while the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]] (NRSC) does so in Senate races. They each raise over $100 million per election cycle, and play important roles in recruiting strong state candidates, while the [[Republican Governors Association]] (RGA) assists in state gubernatorial races; in 2014 it is chaired by Governor [[Chris Christie]] of New Jersey.<ref name=rga-chair>{{cite news |title=

==Ideology and political positions==
{{Conservatism US}}
{{Further2|[[Factions in the Republican Party (United States)]]}}

The Republican Party includes [[Social conservatism in the United States|social conservatives]], [[Neoliberalism|neoliberals]], [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservatives]], [[Neoconservatism|neoconservatives]], [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalists]], [[Right-wing populism|populists]], moderates, and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Adam Goldfein |title=The Factions of the Republican Party |url=http://adamgoldfein.com/the-factions-of-the-republican-party/ |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> Prior to the formation of the conservative coalition, which helped realign the Democratic and Republican party ideologies in the mid-1960s, the party had historically advocated [[classical liberalism]], [[paleoconservatism]], and [[American progressivism|progressivism]].

===Economic policies===
Republicans strongly believe that [[free market]]s and individual achievement are the primary factors behind economic prosperity. To this end, they advocate in favor of [[laissez-faire|laissez-faire economics]], fiscal conservatism, and the elimination of government run welfare programs in favor of private sector nonprofits and encouraging personal responsibility.

A leading economic theory advocated by modern Republicans is [[supply side economics]]. Some fiscal policies influenced by this theory were popularly known as [[Reaganomics]], a term popularized during the Presidential administrations of [[Ronald Reagan]]. This theory holds that reduced income tax rates increase [[GDP]] growth and thereby generate the same or more revenue for the government from the smaller tax on the extra growth.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/node/21530093 | work=The Economist | title=Diving into the rich pool | date=2011-09-24 | accessdate=2012-01-13}}</ref> This belief is reflected, in part, by the party's long-term advocacy of tax cuts. Many Republicans consider the income tax system to be inherently inefficient and oppose graduated tax rates, which they believe are unfairly targeted at those who create jobs and wealth. They believe private spending is usually more efficient than government spending. Republicans oppose the [[estate tax]].

{{Politics of the United States}}
Most Republicans agree there should be a "safety net" to assist the less fortunate; however, they tend to believe the private sector is more effective in helping the poor than government is; as a result, Republicans support giving government grants to faith-based and other private charitable organizations to supplant welfare spending. Members of the GOP also believe that limits on eligibility and benefits must be in place to ensure the safety net is not abused. Republicans introduced and strongly supported the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|welfare reform of 1996]], which was signed into law by Democratic President Clinton, and which limited eligibility for welfare, successfully leading to many former welfare recipients finding jobs.<ref name=Poverty>{{wayback|title=Welfare Reforms Reduce Poverty|publisher=House Committee on Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources|date=2006-04-28|url=http://waysandmeans.house.gov/media/pdf/welfare/042806welfarereport.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5oAXfUewC|archivedate=2010-03-12|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref><ref name=Welfare>{{wayback|title=Welfare Reforms Reduce Welfare Dependence|publisher=House Committee on Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources|date=2006-02-26|url=http://waysandmeans.house.gov/media/pdf/welfare/022706welfare.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5oAXfUcct|archivedate=2010-03-12|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref>

The party opposes a government-run [[single-payer health care]] system, believing such a system constitutes [[socialized medicine]], and is in favor of a personal or employer-based system of insurance, supplemented by [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] for the elderly and [[Medicaid]], which covers approximately 40% of the poor.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}{{Dead link|date=March 2013}}<ref name=2007UnsettlingScores>[http://www2.citizen.org/hrg/medicaid/assets/reports/2007UnsettlingScores.pdf Unsettling Scores: A Ranking of State Medicaid Programs, P. 15]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> The GOP has a mixed record of supporting the historically popular [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], Medicare and Medicaid programs.

In 2011, House Republicans overwhelmingly voted for a proposal named [[The Path to Prosperity]] and for major changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and the [[Health care reform in the United States#Key reform drivers for the 2010 reforms|2010 Health Care Legislation]]. Many Republicans support increased health insurance portability, laws promoting coverage of pre-existing medical conditions, a cap on malpractice lawsuits, the implementation of a streamlined [[electronic medical records]] system, an emphasis on preventative care rather than emergency room care, and tax benefits aimed at making health insurance more affordable for the uninsured and targeted to promote universal access. They generally oppose government funding for elective abortions.<ref name=ontheissues>{{cite web |author=|title=Bobby Jindal on the Issues|work=|publisher=Ontheissues.org|location=|year=|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/House/Bobby_Jindal.htm|accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>

===Labor unions===
{{main|Labor unions in the United States}}
Since the 1920s the GOP has generally opposed by [[trade union|labor union]] organizations and members; they comprise a major component of the Democratic [[New Deal coalition]]. Although unions have lost membership in the private sector since the 1970s, they have gained among public sector unions (such as school teachers). Republicans at the state level generally support various [[right to work]] laws that weaken unions. At the national level the GOP supports the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] of 1947, which gives workers the right not to participate in unions, as opposed to a [[closed shop]], which prohibits workers from choosing not to join unions in workplaces. Most Republicans are opposed to increases in the [[minimum wage]], believing that such increases hurt many businesses by forcing them to cut jobs and services, export jobs overseas, and raise the prices of goods to compensate for the decrease in profit. As Taylor Dark has emphasized in his analysis of the enduring alliance between labor unions and the Democrats, the unions' "most virulent opponents have moved into the Republican Party".<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor E. Dark|first=|title=The Unions and the Democrats: An Enduring Alliance|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uQCmY7znbK4C&pg=PA137|year=2001|publisher=Cornell University Press |page=137}}</ref>

Republicans elected with Tea Party support in 2010, most notably Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] of Wisconsin, have launched major efforts against public sector unions due in part to state government pension obligations along with the allegation that the unions are too powerful.<ref>Nelson Lichtenstein, "Can This Election Save the Unions?", [http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/can-this-election-save-the-unions ''Dissent'' Summer 2012].</ref> Walker was challenged by a coalition of unions and Democrats, but beat back a recall effort and was reelected in 2014.<ref>Jason Stein and Patrick Marley, ''More than They Bargained For: Scott Walker, Unions, and the Fight for Wisconsin'' (2013) is favorable toward Walker.</ref>

===Separation of powers and balance of powers===
Many contemporary Republicans voice support of [[strict constructionism]], the judicial philosophy that the Constitution should be interpreted narrowly and as close to the original intent as is practicable rather than a more flexible "living Constitution" model.<ref name=nytimes2008>{{cite news |author=|title=Supreme Court |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 5, 2008 |url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/issues/judges.html|accessdate=2011-09-05}}</ref><!--It's only McCain's position, so a better ref would be good, but any comparison of the 2008 Republican candidates should show them all agreeing.--> Most Republicans point to [[Roe v. Wade]] as a case of [[judicial activism]], where the court overturned most laws restricting abortion on the basis of a [[privacy law|right to privacy]] inferred from the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. Some Republicans have actively sought to block judges whom they see as being [[judicial activism|activist judges]] and have sought the appointment of judges who claim to practice [[judicial restraint]]. The issue of [[judicial deference]] to the legislature is a matter of some debate<U+2014>like the Democrats, most Republicans criticize court decisions that overturn their own (conservative) legislation as overstepping bounds and support decisions that overturn opposing legislation. Some commentators have advocated that the Republicans take a more aggressive approach and support legislative supremacy more firmly.<ref name=McCarthy>{{cite web |last=McCarthy|first=AC|title=Judicial Restraint |publisher=National Review |year=|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTZmYzY4YzkzYzYxMjY4MzAxZjI4NDdjMmVlYTNmMDQ|accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

The Republican Party has supported various bills within the last decade to strip some or all federal courts of the ability to hear certain types of cases, in an attempt to limit judicial review. These [[jurisdiction stripping]] laws have included removing federal review of the recognition of same-sex marriage with the [[Marriage Protection Act of 2007|Marriage Protection Act]],<ref name=washingtontimes20040722>{{cite news |author=|title=House to debate court stripping |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=2004-07-22 |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20040722-121146-3494r.htm|accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance with the [[Pledge Protection Act]], and the rights of detainees in Guantanamo Bay in the [[Detainee Treatment Act]]. The Supreme Court overruled the last of these limitations in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]''.

Compared to Democrats, many Republicans believe in a more robust version of [[federalism]] with greater limitations placed upon [[Federal government of the United States|federal authorities]] and a larger role reserved for those of the individual States. Following this view on federalism, Republicans often take a less expansive reading of congressional power under the [[Commerce Clause]], such as in the opinion of [[William Rehnquist]] in ''[[United States v. Lopez]]''. Many Republicans on the more libertarian wing wish for a more dramatic narrowing of Commerce Clause power by revisiting, among other cases, ''[[Wickard v. Filburn]]'', a case that held that growing wheat on a farm for consumption on the same farm fell under congressional power to [[Commerce Clause|"regulate commerce ... among the several States"]].

President George W. Bush was a proponent of the [[unitary executive theory]] and cited it within his [[Signing statement (United States)|Signing statements]] about legislation passed by Congress.<ref name=boston20060430>{{cite news |title=Bush challenges hundreds of laws |work=The Boston Globe |location= |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/04/30/bush_challenges_hundreds_of_laws/ |accessdate=2011-09-05 |first=Charlie |last=Savage |authorlink=Charlie Savage |date=2006-04-30}}</ref> The administration's interpretation of the unitary executive theory was called seriously into question by ''Hamdan v.

===Environmental policies===
{{Main|Environmental policy of the United States}}
Historically, [[Progressivism in the United States|more progressive]] leaders in the Republican party supported [[environmental protection]]. For example, Republican President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was a prominent [[Conservation (ethic)|conservationist]] whose policies eventually led to the creation of the modern [[National Park Service]].<ref name=Filler>{{cite web |author=Filler, Daniel|title=Theodore Roosevelt: Conservation as the Guardian of Democracy|url=http://pantheon.cis.yale.edu/~thomast/essays/filler/filler.html|accessdate=2007-11-09}}</ref> Republican President [[Richard Nixon]] was responsible for establishing the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1970.<ref name=Nixon>{{cite web |author=Nixon, Richard|title=Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970|date=1970-07-09|url=http://www.epa.gov/history/org/origins/reorg.htm|accessdate=2007-11-09}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref>

In 2006, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], then the Republican [[Governor of California]], signed into law a set of carbon [[Emission standard|emission regulations]] that were the country's first cap on [[greenhouse gases]], and included vehicle emissions standards higher than those of the Federal Government]].

In 2000, the Republican Party adopted as part of its platform support for the development of market-based solutions to environmental problems. According to the platform, "economic prosperity and environmental protection must advance together, environmental regulations should be based on science, the government's role should be to provide market-based incentives to develop the technologies to meet environmental standards, we should ensure that environmental policy meets the needs of localities, and environmental policy should focus on achieving results processes."<ref name=Encourage>{{cite web |title=Encourage Market-Based Solutions to Environmental Problems|journal=OnTheIssues|date=2000-08-12}}</ref>

[[Green conservatism]] manifested itself as a movement in groups such as [[ConservAmerica]], which seeks to strengthen the Republican Party's stance on environmental issues and support efforts to conserve natural resources and protect human and environmental health.

===Social policies===
The Republican Party is generally associated with [[social conservative]] policies, although it does have dissenting centrist and [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] factions. The social conservatives want laws that uphold their "[[traditional values]]", such as opposition to [[same-sex marriage]], abortion, and marijuana.<ref name="Zelizer 2004 704<U+2013>5">{{cite book|last=Zelizer|first=Julian E.|title=The American Congress: The Building of Democracy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_MGEIIwT5pUC&pg=PA704|year=2004|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|pages=704<U+2013>5}}</ref> Most conservative Republicans also oppose [[gun control]], [[affirmative action]], and [[illegal immigration]].<ref name="Zelizer 2004 704<U+2013>5"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=Roger|title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and Voices|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vRY27FkGJAUC|year=2010|publisher=M.

====Abortion and embryonic stem cell research====
A majority of the GOP's national and state candidates are [[pro-life]] and oppose elective [[abortion]] on religious or moral grounds. However many hold exceptions in the case of [[incest]], rape or the mother's life being at risk. When Congress voted on the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] in 2003, Congressional Republicans voted overwhelmingly to support the ban.

Although the GOP has voted for increases in government funding of scientific research, some members actively oppose the federal funding of [[embryonic stem cell]] research beyond the original lines because it involves the destruction of human [[embryo]]s, while arguing for applying research money into [[adult stem cell]] or amniotic stem cell research. However, human embryos are not and have not been destroyed simply for the purpose of collecting stem cells; the embryos from which stem cells are obtained are already slated for destruction, resulting from extra embryos created for In-vitro-ferilization.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/stem-cells/CA00081 Stem cells: What they are and what they do].

Retrieved on 2013-07-15.</ref> The stem cell issue has garnered two once-rare vetoes on research funding bills from President Bush, who said the research "crossed a moral boundary".

In August 2012, the party approved a platform advocating banning abortions, without exceptions for the cases of rape or incest. The text specifically stated that "the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed." It also opposed using public revenues to promote abortions, to perform them, or to fund organizations that do either such things.<ref name=platform>[http://finance.yahoo.com/news/gop-oks-platform-barring-abortions-gay-marriage-204947742.html GOP OKs platform barring abortions, gay marriage] retrieved 31 October 2012</ref>

====Civil rights====
Republicans are generally against [[affirmative action]] for women and some minorities, often describing it as a [[racial quota|quota system]], believing that it is not [[meritocratic]] and that it is counter-productive socially by only further promoting [[discrimination]]. Many Republicans support race-neutral admissions policies in universities, but support taking into account the socioeconomic status of the student.<ref name=affirmativeaction>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/01/15/bush.affirmativeaction/|work=CNN|title=Bush criticizes university 'quota system'|date=2003-01-15|accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref><ref name= Eilperin >{{cite news |last=Eilperin|first=Juliet|title=Watts Walks a Tightrope on Affirmative Action |newspaper=The Washington Post|date=1998-05-12|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/affirm/stories/aa051298.htm|accessdate=2007-01-22}}</ref>

====Second Amendment rights====
Republicans generally support [[Gun politics in the United States|gun ownership rights]] and oppose laws regulating guns, although some Republicans favor limited restrictions in some urban areas on the grounds of public safety.

====The War on Drugs====
Republicans have historically supported the [[War on Drugs]], and oppose the [[legalization of drugs]], believing that drugs are immoral and wrong, and the country should do its best to protect people from illegal drugs, and support [[Just Say No]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} More recently, several prominent Republicans have advocated for the reduction and reform of [[mandatory sentencing]] laws with regards to drugs.<ref>{{cite web |author=Greg Newburn |title=Top GOP Presidential Contenders Support Mandatory Minimum Reform |date=July 18, 2014 |url=http://famm.org/top-gop-presidential-contenders-support-mandatory-minimum-reform/ |publisher=Families Against Mandatory Minimums |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref>

====Education====
Most Republicans support [[school choice]] through [[charter school]]s and [[school voucher]]s for private schools; many have denounced the performance of the public school system and the teachers' unions. The party has insisted on a system of greater accountability for public schools, most prominently in recent years with the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001. Many Republicans, however, opposed the creation of the [[United States Department of Education]] when it was initially created in 1979.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

====LGBT issues====
Groups advocating for LGBT issues inside the party include the [[Log Cabin Republicans]], [[Young Conservatives For The Freedom To Marry]], and [[College Republicans]].

A November/December 2013 [[Public Religion Research Institute]] poll sponsored by the [[Ford Foundation]] found that Republicans are divided in their perceptions of their own party: 45% think the GOP is friendly toward LGBT people, while 41% think the party is unfriendly.<ref name="A Shifting Landscape" />

==Foreign policy and national defense==
Republicans supported [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s call for [[American entry into World War I]] in 1917, complaining only that he was to slow to go to war. Republicans in 1919 opposed his call for entry into the [[League of Nations]]. A majority supported the League with reservations; a minority opposed membership on any terms. Republicans sponsored world disarmament in the 1920s, and isolationism in the 1930s.<ref>Alex Goodall, "US Foreign Relations under Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover," in Katherine A.S.

:''A) The United States is doing too much in other countries around the world, and it is time to do less around the world and focus more on our own problems here at home. B) The United States must continue to push forward to promote democracy and freedom in other countries around the world because these efforts make our own country more secure.''

Democrats chose A over B by 65%-32%; Republicans chose A over B by 56% to 39%;  Independents chose A over B by 67% to 29%.<ref> See "July 3, 2014 - Iraq - Getting In Was Wrong; Getting Out Was Right, U.S. Voters Tell Quinnipiac University National Poll" [http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2057 Quinnipiac University Poll] item #51</ref>


===Dwight Eisenhower===
In 1952 General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the NATO supreme commander,  was drafted by the Republican Party to counter the candidacy of [[Non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] Senator [[Robert A.

===Nixon-Ford===
Most Republicans supported Nixon-Ford-Kissinger policy of Vietnamization (letting Vietnam do the fighting with American arms) and their policy of detente with the Soviet Union and China.  The conservative wing, led by Reagan, denounced detente with the USSR but was defeated by Ford in 1976,  When Ford lost his reelection bid to Jimmy Carter, Reagan's approach dominated the party.<ref>Sean Wilentz, ''The Age of Reagan: A History, 1974-2008'' (2008) pp  48-72</ref>

===Ronald Reagan===
====Cold War====
President Reagan reignited the Cold War.  [[D<U+00E9>tente]] was rejected in 1979 by President [[Jimmy Carter]] in the face of the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]].  Reagan then ordered a massive buildup of the [[United States Armed Forces]], especially the SDI project to undermine the Soviet nuclear threat by shooting down its missiles.<ref>Norman Podhoretz, "The Reagan Road to D<U+00E9>tente," ''Foreign Affairs;; (1984) 63#3 pp. 447-464 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/20042267 in JSTOR]</ref>

====Grenada====
[[File:US Army Rangers parachute into Grenada during Operation Urgent Fury.jpg|thumb|right|[[U.S. Army Rangers]] conduct an airborne assault in [[Saint George Parish, Grenada]] during the hostilities.]]

On October 25, 1983, at the request of the regional governments, Reagan ordered ''[[Operation Urgent Fury]]'', a military invasion of the small, Caribbean island of [[Grenada]], where over a thousand American students and their families were in residence. A Marxist coup d'<U+00E9>tat had overthrown the established government and shot its leader [[Maurice Bishop]]. This was the first actual [[rollback]] that destroyed a Communist regime and marked the continued escalation of tensions with the Soviet Union known as the [[Cold War (1979<U+2013>1985)|Second Cold War]]. Democrats had been highly critical of Reagan's anti-Communism in Latin America, but this time Reagan had strong support from the voters and leading Democrats said the invasion was justified.<ref name=Hayward>Steven F. Hayward, ''The age of Reagan: The conservative counterrevolution, 1980<U+2013>1989'', p. 323</ref> It built the President's image of decisive strong action a year before the 1984 election, when Mondale said he too would have ordered the invasion. Indeed Mondale attacked Senator [[Gary Hart]], his chief opponent for the Democratic nomination, as isolationist and weak on fighting dictatorships.<ref name=Kagan1996>Robert Kagan, ''A twilight struggle: American power and Nicaragua, 1977<U+2013>1990'' (1996) p. 346</ref>

====Covert operations====
Under a policy that came to be known as the [[Reagan Doctrine]], Reagan and his administration also provided overt and covert aid to [[anti-communist]] [[Guerrilla warfare|resistance movements]] in an effort to "[[rollback]]" Soviet-backed communist governments in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The policy was politically controversial, with liberal Democrats especially angry with Reagan's operations in Latin America.<ref name=Kagan1996>Robert Kagan, ''A twilight struggle: American power and Nicaragua, 1977<U+2013>1990'' (1996) p. 29</ref> Covert operations elsewhere, especially in Afghanistan against the Soviets, however, usually won bipartisan support.<ref Name=Meher2004>Jagmohan Meher, ''America's Afghanistan war'' (2004) [http://books.google.com/books?id=JR4xbUD0Lv8C&pg=PA133&dq=afghanistan+cambodia+%22moral+boost%22+inauthor:Meher&hl=en&ei=LqdkToniHInbiAK-x8SgCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=afghanistan%20cambodia%20%22moral%20boost%22%20inauthor%3AMeher&f=false p. 133 online]</ref>

====Gulf War 1990<U+2013>91====
{{Main|Gulf War}}
On August 1, 1990, [[Iraq]], led by [[Saddam Hussein]], [[Invasion of Kuwait|invaded]] [[Kuwait]]. President Bush formed an international coalition and secured UN approval to expel Iraq. On January 12, 1991, Congress voted approval for a military attack, [[Operation Desert Storm]], by a narrow margin, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed. The vote in the House was 250<U+2013>183, and in the Senate 52<U+2013>47. In the Senate 42 Republicans and 10 Democrats voted yes to war, while 45 Democrats and two Republicans voted no. In the House 164 Republicans and 86 Democrats voted yes, and 179 Democrats, three Republicans and one Independent voted no.<ref name=Hiro>Dilip Hiro, ''Desert Shield to Desert Storm: The Second Gulf War'' (2003) p. 300</ref> The war was short and successful, but Hussein was allowed to remain in power.

===1990s opposition politics===
In the 1990s, Republicans in Congress split over U.S. military intervention in the [[Yugoslav wars]] under Democratic President [[Bill Clinton]]. Examples of interventionist-minded Republicans are then Senate Majority Leader [[Bob Dole]] and Senator [[John McCain]] and examples of opposing figures are later Senate Majority Leader [[Trent Lott]] and House Majority Leader [[Dick Armey]], the latter of which who called [[Kosovo]] deployment "poorly considered and unlikely to achieve our desired ends".<ref>{{cite news|date=March 21, 2011|title=Republicans on Kosovo|author=[[W.

As such, he advocated U.S. military withdrawal from the Balkan NATO peacekeeping mission.<ref name=flip>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-250_162-646142.html|title=Bush's Top Ten Flip-Flops|date=February 11, 2009|publisher=CBS News|first=Joel|last=Roberts}}</ref>

===George W. Bush===

====Invasion of Afghanistan====
After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 in New York, Bush launched the [[War on Terrorism]], in which the United States led an international coalition [[Invasions of Afghanistan#U.S.-led invasion|invaded Afghanistan]], the base of terrorist [[Osama bin Laden]]. This invasion led to the toppling of the [[Taliban]] regime. After a surprise raid on bin Laden's compound on May 2, 2011, ordered by Barack Obama, bin Laden was killed and his body disposed of in the sea. There was bipartisan support for this action, with notable Republican and Democratic figures speaking out in support of the raid.

====Invasion of Iraq====
[[File:Bush auth jbc.jpg|thumb|250px|right|President George W. Bush, surrounded by leaders of the House and Senate, announces the [[Iraq war resolution]] on October 2, 2002.]]

In 2003, following the bipartisan [[Iraq war resolution]] and the perceived issues regarding UN weapons inspectors, President Bush launched the [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]], in conjunction with [[Multi-National Force <U+2013> Iraq|coalition partners]], most notably, the United Kingdom. The invasion was described by Bush as being part of the general 'War on Terrorism'. Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein]] was [[Capture of Saddam Hussein|captured]] and [[Death of Saddam Hussein|executed]], but his supporters and other opposing forces staged an [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|insurgency]] that dragged on for years. It was a major election issue in 2004 (when Bush was reelected) and in 2006 and 2008 (when President Obama was first elected to the Presidency, and Democrats increased their numbers in both Houses of Congress).<ref name=Hess2009>Hess, ''Presidential Decisions for War: Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, and Iraq'' (2009) pp 221<U+2013>76</ref><ref name=impact/>

Significant public support for the war effort existed in the early days among both parties and others, but opinions changed course soon with about half of Americans surveyed in November 2003 judging the end result as not worth it. The lack of expected [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction]] and the failures of the military occupation of Iraq altered voters' views.<ref name="impact">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57575010/10-years-later-the-iraq-wars-lasting-impact-on-u.s-politics/|title=10 years later: The Iraq war's lasting impact on U.S. politics|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=April 17, 2013|date=March 19, 2013|first=Stephanie|last=Condon}}</ref> Polling done by CBS News on the ten-year anniversary of the U.S. invasion found that Republicans, by a margin of 61%, believed that the military action was the right thing to do, with majorities of Democrats and independents disagreeing.

===2010s opposition politics===
President [[Barack Obama]], inaugurated in January 2009 and later reelected to a second term, continued the previous policy of keeping large-scale intervention in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|War in Afghanistan]], with a plan of removing combat troops while Afghan forces trained to replace them until late 2014. An October 2012 Pew Research Center poll found Republicans evenly divided at 48% over the choices of keeping American military forces in Afghanistan "until the situation has stabilized" analogous to Obama's policies versus making them leave "as soon as possible". An article in the news-magazine ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' stated that this represented a move from a previous "hawkish" stance by Republicans.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://e-ring.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/10/19/republicans_growing_conflicted_over_afghanistan_says_poll|title=

====The Arab Spring====
The Republican Party has been largely split on the attitude the United States should take in response to the events of the Arab Spring. Republican leadership in the House and Senate supported the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]], though many conservative congressional Republicans, such as [[Michele Bachmann]], voted in opposition to the intervention.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tea Party Splits On Libya Funding In House Vote |agency=Associated Press |author=Laurie Kellman |date=June 24, 2011 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/24/tea-party-libya-funding-house-vote_n_884386.html |publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> Similarly, many senior Republicans, including presidential nominees [[John McCain]] and [[Mitt Romney]] as well as the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]]-affiliated Florida Senator [[Marco Rubio]] supported arming the Syrian rebels,<ref>{{cite news |title=McCain, Graham call for US to arm Syrian rebels |author=Justin Sink |date=February 19, 2012 |url=http://thehill.com/policy/defense/211597-mccain-graham-call-for-us-to-arm-syrian-rebels |newspaper=The Hill |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Alex Leary |date=September 10, 2013 |title=Rubio says U.S. should still try to arm Syrian rebels |url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/rubio-says-us-should-still-try-to-arm-syrian-rebels/2140934 |publisher=Tampa Bay Times |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Ewen MacAskill in Washington |date=October 8, 2012 |title=Mitt Romney: arm the Syrian rebels |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/mitt-romney-arm-syrian-rebels |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> while conservative Republicans in Congress proclaimed their opposition to this.<ref>{{cite news |date=May 7, 2013 |author=John Gizzi |title=GOP House Freshmen: Don't Arm Syrian Rebels |publisher=NewsMax |url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/house-republicans-syria-arming/2013/05/07/id/503156/ |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Rand Paul |date=May 30, 2013 |title=Helping Syrian rebels a dangerous risk|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/29/opinion/rand-paul-syria/ |publisher=CNN |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> Congressional Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]], were overwhelmingly opposed to the [[Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against the Government of Syria to Respond to Use of Chemical Weapons|proposed US military intervention in Syria]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Where the votes stand on Syria |author=Aaron Blake |date=September 10, 2013 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/09/02/where-the-votes-stand-on-syria/ |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> In both Libya and Syria, Republicans opposed to intervention have cited Islamist influence within the rebel groups<ref>{{cite news |title=GOP Rep.

====Ukraine====
Leading Republicans all supported sanctions against Russia in response to the [[2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine]]. No major politician of either party opposed the first rounds of American and EU sanctions in April 2014.<ref>Katrina vanden Heuvel and Stephen F. Cohen, "Cold War Against Russia<U+2014>Without Debate: The Obama administration's decision to isolate Russia, in a new version of 'containment,' has met with virtually unanimous support from the political and media establishment", ''The Nation'' May 19, 2014 (published May 1, 2014) [http://www.thenation.com/article/179579/cold-war-against-russia-without-debate online]</ref>

===Policies===
As a result, some in the Republican Party support [[unilateralism]] on issues of national security, believing in the ability and right of the United States to act without external support in matters of its national defense. In general, Republican thinking on defense and [[international relations]] is heavily influenced by the theories of [[neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]] and [[Political realism|realism]], characterizing conflicts between nations as struggles between faceless forces of international structure, as opposed to being the result of the ideas and actions of individual leaders. The realist school's influence shows in Reagan's [[Evil empire|Evil Empire]] stance on the [[Soviet Union]] and George W. Bush's [[Axis of evil]].

Republicans secured gains in the [[United States congressional elections, 2002|2002]] and [[United States congressional elections, 2004|2004 elections]], with the [[War on Terror]] being one of the top issues favoring them. Since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], some in the party support [[neoconservatism|neoconservative]] policies with regard to the War on Terror, including the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|2001 war in Afghanistan]] and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

The doctrine of [[preemptive war]], wars to disarm and destroy potential military foes based on speculation of future attacks rather than in defense against actual attack, has been advocated by prominent members of the Bush administration, but the war within Iraq has undercut the influence of this doctrine within the Republican Party. [[Rudy Giuliani]], mayor of New York at the time of the September 11 terrorist attacks, and a candidate for the Republican [[United States presidential election, 2008|presidential nomination in 2008]], has stated his support for that policy, saying America must keep itself "on the offensive" against terrorists.<!--I'm pretty sure we can come up with an equivalent McCain quote. Anyone want to try?-->

The George W. Bush administration took the position that the [[Geneva Conventions]] do not apply to [[unlawful combatant]]s, saying they apply to soldiers serving in the armies of [[nation state]]s and not [[List of designated terrorist organizations|terrorist organizations]] such as [[Al-Qaeda]]. The Supreme Court overruled this position in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'', which held that the Geneva Conventions were legally binding and must be followed in regards to all enemy combatants. Prominent Republicans such as [[John McCain]], [[Mike Huckabee]], and [[Ron Paul]] strongly oppose the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, which they view as torture.

==Other international policies==

===Canada===
Republicans support the construction of the [[Keystone Pipeline]], which would connect the [[Athabasca oil sands]] in Canada to refineries in the United States. Environmentalists in the U.S. and Canada have strongly opposed it, while the Canadian government has lobbied for it.<ref>{{cite news |title=Canada Tries Turning Up Heat on Obama as Keystone Stalled |author=Theophilos Argitis |author2=Andrew Mayeda |date=June 12, 2014 |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-12/canada-tries-turning-up-heat-on-obama-as-keystone-stalled.html |publisher=Bloomberg News |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref>

===Israel===
The Republican leadership supports a strong alliance with [[Israel]], but supports efforts to secure peace in the
Middle East between Israel and its [[Arab]] neighbors.<ref name=canadiancoalition >{{cite web |url=http://canadiancoalition.com/adbusters01/|title=Authorization Required|publisher=canadiancoalition.com}}</ref>

===Russia===
The Republican Party claims the U.S. should promote friendship not only between the United States and Russia, but also between Russia and its neighbors. With Russia, the U.S. needs patience, consistency, and a principled reliance on democratic forces. Russia must stop encouraging the proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]].<ref>Republican Platform adopted at GOP National Convention Aug 12, 2000</ref> The party stress the common interests of the two countries, which include ending [[terrorism]], combating [[nuclear proliferation]], promoting [[bilateral trade]].<ref>2008 Republican Party Platform, September 1, 2008</ref>

===Trade===
The party, through former U.N. Ambassador [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]], has advocated reforms in the [[United Nations]] to halt corruption such as that which afflicted the [[Oil-for-Food Program]]. Most Republicans oppose the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. The party promotes [[free trade]] agreements, most notably [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], [[Dominican Republic<U+2013>Central America Free Trade Agreement]] and an effort to go further south to Brazil, Peru and Colombia, although some have a protectionist view of trade.

===Immigration===
{{see also|Immigration to the United States|Illegal immigration to the United States}}
Republicans are divided on how to confront [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]] between a platform that allows for migrant workers and easing citizenship guidelines, and border enforcement-first approach. In general, pro-growth advocates within the Republican Party support more immigration, and traditional or populist conservatives oppose it. In 2006, the White House supported and Republican-led Senate passed [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006|comprehensive immigration reform]] that would eventually allow millions of illegal immigrants to become citizens, but the House, also led by Republicans, took an enforcement-first approach, and the bill failed to pass the [[conference committee]].<ref name=Blanton>{{cite news |last=Blanton|first=Dana|title=National Exit Poll: Midterms Come Down to Iraq, Bush|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=2006-11-08|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,228104,00.html|accessdate=2007-01-06}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref>

Lately, after the defeat in the 2012 presidential elections, and considering the low percent of Latinos that voted Republican, several Republicans are advocating a friendlier approach to immigrants. Former US Secretary of Commerce [[Carlos Gutierrez]] is promoting the creation of a [[Republicans for Immigration Reform|SuperPAC for immigration reform]].<ref name="wp">{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/new-super-pac-hopes-to-give-cover-to-pro-immigration-republicans/2012/11/16/c3070b74-300b-11e2-a30e-5ca76eeec857_story.html |title=New super PAC hopes to give cover to pro-immigration Republicans |date=17 Nov 2012 |newspaper=The Washington Post|author=[[Peter Wallsten]]}}</ref>

Proposals calling for systematic reform of the U.S. immigration system such that residents that have come into the U.S. illegally have a pathway to legal citizenship have attracted broad Republican support in some polls. For example, the Public Religion Research Institute found in late 2013 that 60% of Republicans supported the pathway concept, compared to 63% of Americans as a whole.<ref name=long-past>{{cite news | last = Frumin | first =Aliyah | title = Obama: 'Long past time' for immigration reform | date = November 25, 2013| url = http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/obama-long-past-time-reform | publisher = [[MSNBC]]|accessdate = January 26, 2014}}</ref>

==Voter base==
In general terms, the number of Americans self-identifying as Republicans has been around 30% over the past twenty years. According to [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup polling]], 29% of Americans identified as Republicans versus 31% doing so as Democrats and 38% as independents in 2010, which represented a slight drop from the 31% identified as Republicans in 1988.<ref name=Gallup2010>{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/145463/Democratic-Party-Drops-2010-Tying-Year-Low.aspx|title=Democratic Party ID Drops in 2010, Tying 22-Year Low|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]]|date=January 5, 2011|accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref> In a 2014 Gallup survey, Republican identification was down to 25 percent, the lowest in at least 25 years.<ref>Kaplan, Rebecca.

Historically speaking, the Republican base initially consisted of northern white Protestants and African-Americans nationwide, with the first Presidential candidate, [[John C. Fremont]], receiving almost no votes in the South. This trend continued into the 20th century, with 1944 Republican presidential candidate [[Thomas E. Dewey]] having only 10% of his popular votes in the South. After the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], the core base shifted considerably. The party's base consists of groups such as white, married Protestants, rural and suburban citizens, and non-union workers without college degrees, with urban residents, ethnic minorities, the unmarried, and union workers having shifted to the Democratic Party.<ref name=voter>{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444506004577613060923763578.html|title=The Evolution of the Republican Party Voter|author=[[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]]|date=August 26, 2012|accessdate=April 17, 2013|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

===Business community===
The GOP is usually seen as the traditionally pro-business party and it garners major support from a wide variety of industries from the financial sector to small businesses. Republicans are about 50 percent more likely to be self-employed, and are more likely to work in management.<ref name=Fried2008p104>Fried, pp. 104<U+2013>5, 125.</ref>

A survey cited by ''The Washington Post'' in 2012 stated that 61 percent of small business owners planned to vote for then-Republican Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney. Small business became a major theme of the [[2012 Republican National Convention]]. For example, South Dakota Senator [[John Thune]] discussed his grandfather's hardware store and New Hampshire Senator [[Kelly Ayotte]] referred to her husband's landscaping company.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-08-30/business/35493960_1_small-business-business-owners-plan-small-companies|title=Small business a common theme at Republican Convention |newspaper=The Washington Post |first=J.

====Education====
In 2012, the [[Pew Research Center]] conducted a study of registered voters with a 35<U+2013>28, Democrat-to-Republican gap. They found that self-described Democrats had a +8 advantage over Republicans among college graduates, +14 of all post-graduates polled. Republicans were +11 among white men with college degrees, Democrats +10 among women with degrees. Democrats accounted for 36% of all respondents with an education of high school or less, Republicans were 28%. When isolating just white registered voters polled, Republicans had a +6 advantage overall and were +9 of those with a high school education or less.<ref name=Pew2012>{{cite web |url=http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-detailed_tables/Detailed%20tables%20for%20Party%20ID.pdf |title=Detailed Party Identification Tables |format=PDF |publisher=Pew Research Center for the People & the Press |date= |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref>

An analysis of 2008 through 2012 survey data from the General Social Survey, the National Election Studies, and the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press led to the following assessment of the overall educational status of self-identified Democrats and Republicans: <blockquote>On average, selfgidentified Republicans have more years of education (4 to 8 months each, depending on the survey) and are probably more likely to hold, at the least, a 4-year college degree. (One major survey indicates that they are more likely, while the results of another survey are statistically insignificant.) It also appears that Republicans continue to out-test Democrats in surveys that assess political knowledge and/or current events. With respect to post-graduate studies, the educational advantage is shifting towards self-identified Democrats. They are now more likely to hold post-graduate college degrees. (One major survey indicates that they are more likely, while the results of another survey are statistically insignificant.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://socialsecuritywaste.org/educational_differences_between_democrats_and_republicans.htm|title=Educational differences between Democrats and Republicans|publisher=}}</ref></blockquote>

====Ethnicity====
[[File:Alan Keyes speech.jpg|thumb|[[Alan Keyes]], the first African American Republican presidential candidate]]
A majority of the Republican voter base is [[White American]]. While historically the party had been supporters of rights for African Americans since the 1860s, it lost its leadership position; the GOP has been winning under 15% of the black vote in recent national elections (1980 to 2008). The party has recently nominated African American candidates for senator or governor in Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maryland, though none were successful. In the 2010 elections, two African American Republicans were elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.<ref name=Holmes2010>{{cite news |author=L. A.

They became one of the core components of the [[New Deal Coalition]].

In recent decades, the party has been moderately successful in gaining support from [[Hispanic]] and [[Asian American]] voters. George W.

For decades, a greater percentage of white voters identified themselves as Democrats, rather than Republicans. However, since the mid-1990s whites have been more likely to self-identify as Republicans than Democrats.<ref name=Fried2008p321>Fried, p. 321.</ref>

====Religious belief====
Religion has always played a major role for both parties but, in the course of a century, the parties' religious compositions have changed. Religion was a major dividing line between the parties before [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]], with Catholics, Jews, and Southern Protestants heavily Democratic, and Northeastern Protestants heavily Republican. Most of the old differences faded away after the realignment of the 1970s and 80s that undercut the New Deal coalition.<ref>To some extent the [[United States Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' caused American Christians to blur their historical division along the line between Catholics and Protestants and instead to realign as conservatives or liberals, irrespective of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation Era]] distinction.</ref> Voters who attend church weekly gave 61% of their votes to Bush in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]]; those who attend occasionally gave him only 47%, while those who never attend gave him 36%. Fifty-nine percent of Protestants voted for Bush, along with 52% of Catholics (even though [[John Kerry]] was Catholic). Since 1980, large majorities of [[evangelism|evangelicals]] have voted Republican; 70<U+2013>80% voted for Bush in 2000 and 2004, and 70% for GOP House candidates in [[United States general elections, 2006|2006]]. Jews continue to vote 70<U+2013>80% Democratic. Democrats have close links with the African American churches, especially the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptists]], while their historic dominance among Catholic voters has eroded to 54<U+2013>46 in the 2010 midterms.<ref name="pewresearch">{{cite web |author=|url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1791/2010-midterm-elections-exit-poll-religion-vote|title=Religion in the 2010 Elections|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=2010-11-03|accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref> The main line traditional Protestants (Methodists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Disciples) have dropped to about 55% Republican (in contrast to 75% before 1968).

[[File:2004prescountymap2.PNG|thumb|275px|This map shows the vote in the 2004 presidential election by county. All major Republican geographic constituencies are visible: red dominates the map, showing Republican strength in the rural areas, while the denser areas (i.e., cities) are blue. Notable exceptions include the Pacific coast, New England, the [[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Black Belt]], areas with high [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] populations, and the [[:File:New 2000 hispanic percent.gif|heavily Hispanic]] parts of the Southwest.]]

===Location===
Since 1980, geographically the Republican "base" ("[[Red states and blue states|red states]]") is strongest in the [[Southern United States|South]], the Midwest, and [[Mountain States|Mountain West]]. While it is weakest on the West Coast and Northeast, this has not always been the case; historically the northeast was a bastion of the Republican Party with [[Vermont]] and [[Maine]] being the only two states to vote against [[Franklin Roosevelt]] all four times. The [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] has been roughly balanced since 1854, with [[Illinois]] becoming more Democratic and liberal because of the city of Chicago (see below) and [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]] more Republican since 1990. [[Ohio]] and [[Indiana]] both trend Republican. Since the 1930s, the Democrats have dominated most central cities, while the Republicans now dominate rural areas and the majority of suburbs.<ref name="CNN.com Election 2004">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html|title=Election 2004|accessdate=2007-06-01|work=CNN}}</ref>

The South has become solidly Republican in national elections since 1980, and has been trending Republican at the state level since then at a slower pace.<ref name=Black2005>Earl Black and Merle Black. ''Politics and Society in the South'' (2005)</ref> In 2004, Bush led Kerry by 70%<U+2013>30% among Southern whites, who made up 71% of the Southern electorate. Kerry had a 70<U+2013>30 lead among the 29% of the voters who were black or Hispanic. One-third of these Southern voters said they were white evangelicals; they voted for Bush by 80<U+2013>20; but were only 72% Republican in 2006.<ref name=2006cnnexitpolls/><ref name=2004cnnexitpolls/>

The Republican Party's strongest focus of political influence lies in the [[Great Plains]] states, particularly [[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[South Dakota]], and [[North Dakota]], and in the [[Mountain states]] of [[Idaho]], [[Wyoming]], and [[Utah]] (Utah gave George W. Bush more than 70% of the popular vote in 2004). These states are sparsely populated with few major urban centers, and have majority white populations, making it extremely difficult for Democrats to create a sustainable voter base there. While still remaining notably Republican, [[Politics of Montana|Montana]] is the only state in the region with a more moderate lean.<ref>{{cite news |title=Presidential Geography: Montana |author=Micah Cohen |date=June 21, 2012 |work=FiveThirtyEight |publisher=The New York Times |url=http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/presidential-geography-montana/ |accessdate=2013-07-15}}</ref> Unlike the South, these areas have been strongly Republican since before the party realignments of the 1960s. The Great Plains states were one of the few areas of the country where Republicans had any significant support during the [[Great Depression]].

===Conservatives, moderates, liberals, and progressives===
Republican conservatives are strongest in the South, Mountain West and Midwest, where they draw support from social conservatives. The moderates tend to dominate the party in New England, and used to be well represented in all states. From the 1940s to the 1970s under such leaders as [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Richard Nixon]], and [[Gerald Ford]], they usually dominated the presidential wing of the party. Since the 1970s, they have been less powerful, though they are always represented in the cabinets of Republican presidents. In Vermont, [[Jim Jeffords]], a Republican Senator became an [[independent (politician)|independent]] in 2001 due to growing disagreement with President Bush and the party leadership. In addition, moderate Republicans have recently held the governorships in several [[New England]] States, while [[Lincoln Chafee]], a former moderate Republican senator is the independent governor of Rhode Island. Senators [[Olympia Snowe]] and [[Susan Collins]], both of Maine, and Senator [[Scott Brown]] of [[Massachusetts]] are notable moderate Republicans from New England. From 1991 to 2007, moderate Republicans served as governors of Massachusetts. Prominent Republican moderates have included Presidents [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Richard M. Nixon]] and [[George Bush Sr.]], as well as Senate leaders [[Howard Baker]] and [[Bob Dole]], and New York Mayors [[Rudy Giuliani]] and [[Michael Bloomberg]].

Some well-known conservative radio hosts, including national figures such as [[Rush Limbaugh]], [[Sean Hannity]], [[Glenn Beck]], [[Neal Boortz]], [[Laura Ingraham]], [[Michael Reagan]], [[Howie Carr]], and [[Michael Savage (commentator)|Michael Savage]], as well as many local commentators, support Republican causes, while vocally opposing those of the Democrats.<ref name=Dagnes>Alison Dagnes, ''Politics on demand: the effects of 24-hour news on American politics'' (2010) p. 53</ref>

Historically, the Republican Party has included a liberal wing made up of individuals who, like members of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, believe in the power of government to improve people's lives. Before 1932 leading progressive Republicans included [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]], [[Charles Evan Hughes]], [[Hiram Johnson]], [[William Borah]], [[George W. Norris]], [[Hiram Johnson]], and [[Fiorello La Guardia]].<ref>Michael Wolraich, ''Unreasonable Men: Theodore Roosevelt and the Republican Rebels Who Created Progressive Politics'' (2014)</ref> Prominent liberal Republicans, 1936 to the 1970s, included [[Alf Landon]], [[Wendell Willkie]], [[Earl Warren]], [[Thomas Dewey]], [[Prescott Bush]], [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]], [[George W. Romney]], [[William Scranton]], and [[Jacob Javits]]. Since 1976, liberalism has virtually faded out of the GOP, apart from a few Northeastern holdouts.<ref name="Nicol C. Rae 1989"/>

===Republican factions: populist vs establishment===
Nationwide polls of Republican voters in 2014 by the Pew Center identified a growing split in the GOP coalition, between "business conservatives" or "establishment conservatives" and "steadfast conservatives" or "populist conservatives".<ref>Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, [http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/the-political-typology-beyond-red-vs-blue/ "Beyond Red vs. Blue: The Political Typology" June 26, 2014]</ref> Each group is over 84% Republican, and together they comprise 70% of the Republicans who played who pay close attention to politics and typically vote in most elections. Both factions are solidly inside the conservative coalition, and they agree on most issues. However they sharply disagree on economic issues of concern to business. 71% of the populist faction believe that too much power is concentrated in the hands of large companies, compared to only 35% among the establishment faction. Asked whether Wall Street helps the economy, 74% of the establishment faction agreed compared to 49% of the populist faction. The factions differ sharply on whether the US should be more or less active in world affairs. On foreign trade, 68% of the establishment faction believes that free trade agreements benefit the American economy, compared to only 39% of the populist faction. In the immigration debate, the establishment faction favors a path to citizenship, and 64% says that immigrants strengthen the nation, compared to only 17% of the populists. The tension exploded into front-page news and June 2014, when an establishment leader, house Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] was upset by Prof. [[Dave Brat]], a little-known populist conservative and economics professor, in the Republican primary in Virginia. The establishment Republicans fought back in the Mississippi primary in June, as incumbent U.S. Senator [[Thad Cochran]] narrowly defeated populist state senator [[Chris McDaniel]] in a bitter fight that featured heavy spending by national organizations.

The [[Tea Party movement]] is typically aligned with the Republican Party, but it feuds with the pro-business wing of the party, which it sees as too moderate and too willing to compromise.<ref>{{cite news |author=Jeremy W. Peters |title=With Fear of Being Sidelined, Tea Party Sees the Republican Rise as New Threat |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/us/politics/before-battling-democrats-gop-is-fighting-itself-.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 8, 2014}}</ref>

In Congress, Cantor's replacement as Majority Leader is Congressman [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]], who had been an advocate of the Export-Import Bank. It finances overseas purchases of American products, especially airplanes. However after meeting with populist Congressmen, McCarthy changed positions and decided to support the termination of the Bank.<ref>William A.

In March 2013, National Committee Chairman [[Reince Priebus]] gave a stinging report on the GOP's failures in 2012, calling on the party to reinvent itself and officially endorse immigration reform. He said, "There's no one reason we lost. Our message was weak; our ground game was insufficient; we weren't inclusive; we were behind in both data and digital; and our primary and debate process needed improvement." He proposed 219 reforms that including a $10 million marketing campaign to reach women, minorities and gays; a shorter, more controlled primary season; and better data collection and research facilities.<ref>Rachel Weiner, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/03/18/reince-priebus-gives-gop-prescription-for-future/ "Reince Priebus gives GOP prescription for future", ''The Washington Post'' March 18, 2013]</ref>

It has been reported recently (as of late 2011, early 2012) that the Republican Party has veered far more towards the right or conservative side of the political spectrum in the most recent election cycle. As the republican party veers more conservative, an independent study group examining the economic situation of the United States, known as "Simpson-Bowles", (of which the two main members are a high powered democrat and republican, specifically a former Chief of Staff of President Clinton and Republican whip for 20 some years) has determined that the position put forth by President Obama in the 2011 debt crisis is the best overall path for the United States to travel, economically.<ref>[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/12265 Charlie Rose]. charlierose.com.
