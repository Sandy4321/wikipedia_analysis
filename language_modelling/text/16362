'''1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania''' was an oral [[ultimatum]] presented to [[Juozas Urb<U+0161>ys]], [[Foreign Minister of Lithuania|Foreign Minister]] of [[Lithuania]], by [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], Foreign Minister of [[Nazi Germany]], on March 20, 1939. The Germans demanded that Lithuania give up the [[Klaip<U+0117>da Region]] (also known as Memel Territory), which had been detached from Germany after [[World War I]], or the [[Wehrmacht]] would invade Lithuania. After years of rising tension between Lithuania and Germany, increasing pro-Nazi propaganda in the region, and continued German expansion, the demand was expected. The ultimatum was issued just five days after the [[Occupation of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany|Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia]]. The four signatories of the 1924 Klaip<U+0117>da Convention, which had guaranteed the protection of the ''status quo'' in the region, did not offer any material assistance. Great Britain and France followed policies of [[appeasement]], while Italy and Japan openly supported Germany. Lithuania was forced to accept the ultimatum on March 22. For Germany it was the last territorial acquisition before [[World War II]]; for Lithuania it was a major downturn in economy and morale; for Europe it was further escalation in pre-war tensions.

==Klaip<U+0117>da dispute==
{{main|Klaip<U+0117>da Region}}

[[Klaip<U+0117>da]] (German: ''Memel''), an important seaport in [[East Prussia]], was detached from Germany by Article 28 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and was governed by the Allies according to Article 99. France assumed administration of the region while Lithuania continued to lobby for its control, claiming that it should belong to Lithuania as it had a significant Lithuanian population (see [[Lithuania Minor]]) and was that country's only access to the [[Baltic Sea]]. Poland also laid claim to the territory. As the Allies were hesitant to make a decision and it seemed that the region would remain a free state much like the [[Free City of Danzig]], Lithuania took the initiative and organized the [[Klaip<U+0117>da Revolt]] in January 1923.<ref>{{cite book |title=Collective Preventive Diplomacy: A Study in International Conflict Management |first=Barry Howard |last=Steiner |year=2004 |pages=74<U+2013>75 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=079145987X}}</ref> [[Soviet Russia]] and Germany supported the action. The region, as an [[autonomy|autonomous]] territory with its own parliament ([[Diet (assembly)|diet]]), was attached to Lithuania. The region covered about 2,400&nbsp;km<U+00B2> and had a population of approximately 140,000.<ref>{{de icon}} {{cite web |first=Andreas| last=Gonschior |url= http://www.gonschior.de/weimar/Memelgebiet/index.htm |title=Das Memelgebiet <U+00DC>berblick |work=Wahlen in der Weimarer Republik |accessdate=2008-03-24}}</ref>

During the 1920s, Lithuania and Germany maintained a warm relationship as they were united by anti-Polish sentiment.<ref>{{cite book | last=Eidintas | first=Alfonsas | coauthors=Vytautas <U+017D>alys, Alfred Erich Senn | editor=Ed.

An especially tense period came in February 1934 when the Lithuanian government arrested dozens of pro-Nazi activists.

==Rising tension==
In spring 1938 Adolf Hitler personally stated that gaining Klaip<U+0117>da was a high priority, second only to gaining [[Sudetenland]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Baltic and the Outbreak of the Second World War | first=John |last= Hiden | coauthors=Thomas Lane |page=53 |publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1992| url= http://books.google.com/books?id=HzrpExvg2XgC&pg=PA53&sig=9o26IN7vq_kkMRx1-WzndpL29lg#PPA53,M1 | isbn= 0-521-53120-9 }}</ref> When [[1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania|Poland presented its ultimatum to Lithuania]] in March 1938, Germany openly declared that in the event of a military clash between Poland and Lithuania, its army would invade Lithuania to capture Klaip<U+0117>da and a large portion of western Lithuania. A week after Lithuania accepted the Polish ultimatum,<ref name=cd117/> Germany presented an eleven-point [[memorandum]] that demanded freedom of action for pro-German activists in the region and a lessening of Lithuanian influence there. Its points were worded in a deliberately vague manner, which would enable Germany to accuse Lithuania of violations.<ref name=eidintas>{{cite book | last=Eidintas | first=Alfonsas | coauthors=Vytautas <U+017D>alys, Alfred Erich Senn | editor=Ed.

==The ultimatum==
[[Image:Hitler speech in klaipeda.jpg|thumb|left|Hitler making a speech in Klaip<U+0117>da the day after the ultimatum was accepted]]
Rumors had reached the Lithuanian government to the effect that Germany had specific plans to take over Klaip<U+0117>da. On March 12, Foreign Minister Urb<U+0161>ys represented Lithuania at the coronation of [[Pope Pius XII]] in Rome. On his return to Lithuania he stopped in Berlin with the hope of clarifying the growing rumors.<ref name=eidintas/> On March 20, Ribbentrop agreed to meet with Urb<U+0161>ys, but not with [[Kazys <U+0160>kirpa]], who was asked to wait in another room. The conversation lasted for about 40 minutes.<ref name=cd117/> Ribbentrop demanded the return of Klaip<U+0117>da to Germany and threatened military action. Urb<U+0161>ys relayed the verbal ultimatum to the Lithuanian government. Because the ultimatum was never set down in writing and did not include a formal deadline, some historians have downplayed its import, describing it as a set of "demands" rather than as an ultimatum.<ref name=gerutis>{{cite book | last=Gerutis | first=Albertas | editor=Ed. Albertas Gerutis | others=translated by Algirdas Budreckis | title=Lithuania: 700 Years | year=1984 | edition=6th | publisher=Manyland Books | location=New York | id={{LCC | 75-80057}} |isbn=0-87141-028-1 | pages=247<U+2013>249 | chapter=Independent Lithuania}}</ref> However, it was made clear that force would be used should Lithuania resist, and it was warned not to seek help from other nations. While a clear deadline was not given, Lithuania was told to make a speedy decision and that any clashes or German casualties would inevitably provoke a response from the German military.<ref name=cd117/>

Lithuania secretly informed the signatories of the Klaip<U+0117>da Convention about these demands, since technically Lithuania could not transfer Klaip<U+0117>da without the approval of the signatories.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=New York Times |title=Lithuania Agrees to Yield Memel to Reich After Berlin Asks Speed to Avoid "Clashes" |date=1939-03-22 |pages=2}}</ref> Italy and Japan supported Germany in the matter, while England and France expressed sympathy but chose not to offer any material assistance. They followed a well-publicized policy of [[appeasement of Hitler|appeasing Hitler]]. England treated the issue in the same way as it had treated the [[Sudeten Crisis]] and made no plans to assist Lithuania or the other [[Baltic States]] if they were attacked by Germany.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Baltic and the Outbreak of the Second World War |first=John |last=Hiden |coauthors=Thomas Lane |pages=31<U+2013>32 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HzrpExvg2XgC&pg=PA26&sig=0HqX5IDBjUcB8Qs5UYPQXZzAdVc#PPA30,M1 |year=1992 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=0521531209}}</ref> The Soviet Union, while supporting Lithuania in principle, did not wish to disrupt its relations with Germany at that point, since it was contemplating an alliance with the Nazis.<ref name=cd117/> Without any material international support Lithuania had no choice but to accept the ultimatum. Lithuanian diplomacy characterized the concession as a "necessary evil" that would enable Lithuania to preserve its independence and maintained the hope that it was merely a temporary retreat.<ref name=eidintas/>

==Acceptance==
At 1:00 am on March 23, Urb<U+0161>ys and Ribbentrop signed a treaty, effective March 22, stating that Lithuania was "voluntarily" transferring the Klaip<U+0117>da Region to Germany. The treaty comprised five articles:

{{cquote| '''Article I''': The Klaip<U+0117>da Region, cut off from Germany by the Treaty of Versailles, is reunited with the German Reich, effective today.

'''Article II''': The Klaip<U+0117>da Region is to be evacuated immediately by Lithuanian military and police forces. The Lithuanian Government will take care that the territory is left in orderly condition through the evacuation.

Both sides will name commissioners, so far as it will prove necessary, who are able to carry out the handing over of administration not held in the hands of autonomous authorities of the Klaip<U+0117>da Region.

Regulations of the rest of the questions resulting from the exchange of State sovereignty, especially economic and financial questions, questions of officials as well as citizenship, are reserved for special agreements.

'''Article III''': In order to make allowance for her economic needs a Lithuanian free port zone will be established for Lithuania in Klaip<U+0117>da. Details will be expressively regulated in accordance with directions of an enclosure attached to this agreement.

'''Article IV''': In order to strengthen their decision and to safeguard the friendly development of relations between Germany and Lithuania, both sides assume the obligation neither to proceed against the other by force nor to support an attack from a third side against one of the two sides.

'''Article V''': This agreement becomes effective upon signature. In witness whereof the plenipotentiaries of both sides sign this treaty, prepared double in double original in the German and in the Lithuanian languages.

==Aftermath==

President [[Antanas Smetona]]'s unconditional acceptance of a second ultimatum in the space of a little over one year became a major source of dissatisfaction with his authoritarian rule. The German ultimatum triggered a political crisis: the passive cabinet of [[Vladas Mironas]] was replaced by a cabinet headed by General [[Jonas <U+010C>ernius]]. For the first time since the [[1926 Lithuanian coup d'<U+00E9>tat|1926 coup d'<U+00E9>tat]], the government included members of the opposition: [[Leonas Bistras]], of the [[Lithuanian Christian Democrats]], was named Minister of Education and [[Jurgis Krik<U+0161><U+010D>i<U+016B>nas]], of the [[Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union]], was named Minister of Agriculture.<ref name=ist>{{lt icon}} {{cite book |title=Lietuvos istorija 11<U+2013>12 klas<U+0117>ms | first=R<U+016B>stis |last=Kamuntavi<U+010D>ius |coauthors=Vaida Kamuntavi<U+010D>ien<U+0117>, Remigijus Civinskas, Kastytis Antanaitis |year=2001 |publisher=Vaga |location=Vilnius |isbn=5-415-01502-7 |pages=396<U+2013>397}}</ref> Because other parties were banned, Bistras and Krik<U+0161><U+010D>i<U+016B>nas were officially billed as independent private citizens.<ref name=crisis/> Four generals were now members of the cabinet as well. However, even the looming international crisis did not induce Lithuanian politicians to unite, and they continued to engage in petty political disputes.<ref name=ist/>

The loss of its only access to the [[Baltic Sea]] was a major blow to the Lithuanian economy. Between 70% and 80% of foreign trade passed through Klaip<U+0117>da.<ref name=eidintas/> The region, which represented only about 5% of Lithuania's territory, contained a third of its industry.<ref name=eidintas/> Lithuania also lost its heavy investments in the port's infrastructure. About 10,000 refugees, mostly Jews, left the region and sought shelter and support from the Lithuanian government.<ref name=cd117/> Lithuanians doubted the fate of their country: in March<U+2013>April withdrawals of deposits in banks and credit institutions totaled almost 20% of total deposits.<ref name=crisis/> After the loss of Klaip<U+0117>da, Lithuania drifted into the German [[sphere of influence]], especially in terms of trade. At the end of 1939, Germany accounted for 75% of Lithuanian exports and for 86% of its imports.<ref name=cd117/> Germany and the [[Soviet Union]] concluded the [[Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop Pact]] in 1939, dividing Eastern Europe into their respective spheres of influence. Not surprisingly, Lithuania was, at first, assigned to Germany.<ref name=cd117/> The Nazis went so far as to suggest a German<U+2013>Lithuanian military alliance against Poland and promised to return the [[Vilnius Region]], but Lithuania held to its policy of strict neutrality.<ref>{{cite book | first=Walter C. |last=Clemens| title=The Baltic Transformed: Complexity Theory and European Security| year=2001 | isbn=0847698599 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |pages=6 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=RL1EQI3LnCIC&pg=PA6&sig=HqbvDq6cHdqVIulmGk_QbxvB3tE }}</ref>
