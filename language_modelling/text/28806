'''''The Adventures of Tintin''''' ({{lang-fr|Les Aventures de Tintin}}) is a series of comic books created by [[Belgium|Belgian]] artist {{lang|fr|Georges Remi}} (1907<U+2013>1983), who wrote under the pen name of [[Herg<U+00E9>]]. The series is one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century, with translations published in more than 50 languages and more than 200 million copies of the books sold to date.<ref name="guardian">{{cite news|first = Maev|last = Kennedy|authorlink = Maev Kennedy|title = Museum aims to draw crowds with cartoon boy wonder aged 75|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,6109,1088427,00.html|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date = 19 November 2003|accessdate =12 September 2006}}</ref>

The series first appeared in French in ''{{lang|fr|[[Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me]]}}'', a children's supplement to the Belgian newspaper {{lang|fr|''[[Le XXe Si<U+00E8>cle]]''}} on 10 January 1929.
The success of the series saw the serialised strips published in Belgium's leading newspaper [[Le Soir]], collected into a series of twenty-four albums, spun into a successful [[Tintin magazine]], and adapted for film, radio, television and theatre. 

Set during a largely realistic 20th century, the hero of the series is [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]], a young Belgian reporter. He is aided in his adventures by his faithful [[Wire Fox Terrier|fox terrier]] dog [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]] (''{{lang|fr|Milou}}'' in French). Later, popular additions to the cast included the brash and cynical [[Captain Haddock]], the highly intelligent but hearing-impaired [[Professor Calculus]] (''{{lang|fr|Professeur Tournesol}}'') and other supporting characters such as the incompetent [[detective]]s [[Thomson and Thompson]] (''{{lang|fr|Dupont et Dupond}}''). Herg<U+00E9> himself features in several of the comics as a background character, as do his assistants in some instances.

The comic strip series has long been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in Herg<U+00E9>'s signature {{lang|fr|''[[ligne claire]]''}} style.<ref name="Clements 2006">[[#Cle06|Clements 2006]].</ref><ref name="Wagner 2006">[[#Wag06|Wagner 2006]].</ref><ref>[[#Lic06|Lichfield 2006]].</ref><ref>"Blistering barnacles!

The stories within the Tintin series always feature slapstick humour, offset in later albums by dashes of sophisticated satire and political/cultural commentary.

== History ==

Belgian [[comic strip]] creator Georges Remi<U+2014>who would become better known under his pen name of Herg<U+00E9><U+2014>first came up with the character of [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]], a young boy reporter, whilst working at the right wing Belgian newspaper ''[[Le XXe Si<U+00E8>cle]]'' (''The 20th century''). Pioneering this new character in the story ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'', this comic, which involved Tintin battling the socialist authorities in the [[Soviet Union]], was serialised in ''Le XXe Si<U+00E8>cle'''s supplement for children, ''[[Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me]]'' (''The Little Twentieth''), from 10 January 1929 until 11 May 1930.<ref>[[#Lof92|Lofficier and Lofficier 2002]]. pp. 22<U+2013>23.</ref> The series was an instant success, sales of the Thursday edition of the newspaper, the day the supplement appeared, were to increase by 600%. Herg<U+00E9> went on to pen a string of new ''Adventures of Tintin'', sending his character to real locations such as the Belgian Congo, the United States, Egypt, India, China, and the United Kingdom, and also to fictional countries of his own devising, such as the Latin American republic of [[San Theodoros]] and the East European kingdom of [[Syldavia]].

As he produced these works, his political approach to the world began to change; the earliest books reflected the [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]], fascist, and [[imperialism|imperialistic]] attitudes of those for whom he worked.<ref>[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. p. 24.</ref> As he got older, he became more critical of the political far right, with the eighth Tintin adventure, ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]'' (1939), involving Tintin battling the forces of fictional fascist state [[Borduria]], whose leader, named M<U+00FC>sstler, was a combination of Nazi German leader [[Adolf Hitler]] and Italian Fascist leader [[Benito Mussolini]].<ref>[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. p. 82.</ref> 

[[Image:Gestapomen following the white buses.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Himself an anti-fascist, Herg<U+00E9> focused his ''Adventures of Tintin'' on non-political themes to avoid trouble with the Gestapo (pictured here) during the period of Nazi occupation.]]
Then, in May 1940, [[Nazi Germany]] invaded Belgium as World War II broke out across Europe, and although Herg<U+00E9> initially considered fleeing into a self-imposed exile, he ultimately decided to stay in his occupied homeland.<ref>[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. pp. 91<U+2013>92.</ref> To ensure their own dominance, the Nazi authorities closed down ''Le XXe Si<U+00E8>cle'', leaving Herg<U+00E9> unemployed.<ref name="Thompson 1991. p. 91-92">[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. pp. 90<U+2013>91.</ref> In search of employment, he was given a job as an illustrator at Belgium's leading newspaper, ''[[Le Soir]]'' (''The Evening''), which was allowed to continue publication under German management.<ref>[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. pp. 92<U+2013>93.</ref> On 17 October 1940 he was made editor of the paper's children's supplement, ''Le Soir Jeunesse'', in which he set about producing new Tintin adventures.<ref>[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. pp. 98<U+2013>99.</ref> In this new, more repressive political climate, Herg<U+00E9> could no longer explore political themes in his ''Adventures of Tintin'' lest he be arrested by the Nazi secret police, the [[Gestapo]]. As Tintinologist [[Harry Thompson]] noted, Tintin's role as a reporter came to an end, to be replaced by his new role as an explorer, something which was not a politically sensitive topic.<ref name="Thompson 1991. p. 112">[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. p. 112.</ref> 

With the end of the war, Herg<U+00E9> left ''Le Soir'' and, in 1949, accepted an invitation to continue ''The Adventures of Tintin'' in the new ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine (Le journal de Tintin). Finally, Herg<U+00E9>'s Tintin series reached the height of its success in 1950 when he created [[Studios Herg<U+00E9>]]. The famous studios produced eight new Tintin albums, coloured and reformatted several old Tintin albums, and released additional publications until Herg<U+00E9>'s death in 1983. After 1986, the Studios were disbanded and its assets transferred to the [[Herg<U+00E9> Foundation]]. ''The Adventures of Tintin'' continue to entertain new generations of Tintin fans today.

==Synopsis==
=== Characters ===
{{Main|List of The Adventures of Tintin characters}}

==== Tintin and Snowy ====
{{Main|Tintin (character)|Snowy (character)}}

Tintin is a young Belgian reporter who becomes involved in dangerous cases in which he takes heroic action to save the day. Almost every adventure features Tintin hard at work in his investigative journalism, but seldom is he seen actually turning in a story. He is a young man of neutral attitudes and boy scout ideals; in this respect, he represents the [[everyman]].
 
Readers and critics have described Tintin as a well-rounded yet open-ended, intelligent and imaginative character, noting that his rather neutral personality<U+2014>sometimes labelled as bland<U+2014>permits a balanced reflection of the evil, folly and foolhardiness which surrounds him. His boy-scout ideals, which represent Herg<U+00E9>'s own, are never compromised by the character, and his status allows the reader to assume his position within the story, rather than merely following the adventures of a strong protagonist.<ref>''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4534602.stm Faces of the week]'' <U+2013> [[BBC News]], Friday 16 December 2005</ref> Tintin's iconic representation enhances this aspect, with [[Scott McCloud]] noting that it "allows readers to mask themselves in a character and safely enter a sensually stimulating world."<ref>{{cite book | author=McCloud, Scott | title=Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art | publisher=Kitchen Sink Press | year=1993 | isbn=0-87816-243-7}}</ref> 

Snowy (''Milou'' in the original version), a white fox terrier, is Tintin's four-legged companion. The bond between Snowy and Tintin is very deep as they have saved each other from perilous situations. Snowy frequently "speaks" to the reader through his thoughts (often displaying a dry sense of humour), which are supposedly not heard by the human characters in the story. Snowy has nearly let Tintin down on occasion, particularly when distracted by a bone. Like Captain Haddock, he is fond of ''[[Loch Lomond#Other_popular_culture|Loch Lomond]]'' brand [[Scotch whisky]], and his occasional bouts of drinking tend to get him into trouble, as does his [[arachnophobia]].

==== Captain Haddock ====
{{Main|Captain Haddock}}

Captain Archibald Haddock, a seafaring captain of disputed ancestry (he may be of Belgian, French, or Scottish origin), is Tintin's best friend, who was introduced in ''The Crab with the Golden Claws''. Haddock was initially depicted as a weak and alcoholic character, but later became more respectable. He evolves to become genuinely heroic and even a socialite after he finds a treasure captured by his ancestor, [[Sir Francis Haddock]]. The Captain's coarse humanity and sarcasm act as a counterpoint to Tintin's often implausible heroism; he is always quick with a dry comment whenever the boy reporter seems too idealistic. Captain Haddock lives in the luxurious mansion [[Marlinspike Hall]].

Haddock uses a range of colourful insults and curses to express his feelings, such as "billions of blue blistering barnacles" (sometimes just "blistering barnacles", "billions of blistering barnacles", or "blue blistering barnacles"),  "ten thousand thundering typhoons" (sometimes  just "thundering typhoons"), "[[Caveman|troglodyte]]", "bashi-bazouk", "visigoths", "[[kleptomania]]c", "[[ectoplasm (cell biology)|ectoplasm]]", "[[sea gherkin]]", "[[anacoluthon]]", "[[Acne scarring|pockmark]]", "[[nincompoop]]", "[[abominable snowman]]", "[[Idiot (usage)|nitwits]]", "scoundrels", "[[steam roller]]s", "[[parasite]]s", "vegetarians", "floundering oath", "carpet seller","blundering [[Bazooka]]s", "[[Dandy|Popinjay]]", "[[bragger]]", "[[List of disability-related terms with negative connotations|pinheads]]", "miserable [[slug]]s", "[[ectomorphic|ectomorph]]", "[[mania]]cs", "[[freshwater]] [[Sailor|swabs]]", "miserable [[molecule]] of [[mildew]]", and "Fuzzy Wuzzy", but nothing that is actually considered a [[profanity|swear word]]. Haddock is a hard drinker, particularly fond of rum and of ''Loch Lomond'' scotch whisky; his bouts of drunkenness are often used for comic effect.

Captain Haddock remained without a first name until the last completed story, ''Tintin and the Picaros''.

==== Supporting characters ====
Herg<U+00E9>'s supporting characters have been cited as far more developed than the central character, each imbued with a strength of character and depth of personality which has been compared with that of the characters of [[Charles Dickens]].<ref name="ZeroHero">{{cite news|first=Tom |last=McCarthy|page=4|title=Review: From zero to hero|date=1 July 2006|work=The Guardian |location=London |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1809827,00.html }}</ref> Herg<U+00E9> used the supporting characters to create a [[realism (arts)|realistic]] world in which to set his protagonists' adventures. To further the realism and continuity, characters would recur throughout the series. It has been speculated that the occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Herg<U+00E9> forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations. The major supporting cast was developed during this period.<ref name=ninthart>{{cite web|last=Yusuf|first=Bulent|date=14 November 2005|url=http://www.ninthart.com/display.php?article=1123|title=Alphabetti Fumetti: H is for Herg<U+00E9>|accessdate=9 September 2006}}</ref>

* [[Professor Calculus]], an [[absent-minded professor]] and half-deaf [[physicist]], is a minor but regular character alongside Tintin, Snowy, and Captain Haddock. He was introduced in ''[[Red Rackham's Treasure]]'', and based partially on {{lang|fr|[[Auguste Piccard]]}},<ref name=submarinehistory>{{cite web|last=Mauron|first=Pascal|url=http://www.brazosport.cc.tx.us/~nstevens/patches/swiss_sub/Piccards.pdf|title=A small history of Swiss submarines|accessdate=9 September 2006|format=PDF}}</ref> a Swiss physicist. His presence was initially not welcomed by the leading characters, but through his generous nature and his scientific ability he develops a lasting bond with them. Eventually, at the end of the album [[Land of Black Gold]], he has become a resident of Marlinspike Hall. Calculus has a tendency to act in an aggressive manner when someone says he's "acting the goat." He is a fervent believer in [[dowsing]], and carries a [[pendulum]] for that purpose. Calculus's deafness is a frequent source of humour, as he repeats back what he thinks he has heard, usually in the most unlikely words possible. He does not admit to being near-deaf and insists he is only a little hard of hearing in one ear.

* [[Thomson and Thompson]] are two bumbling detectives who, although unrelated, look like twins whose only discernible difference is the shape of their moustaches.<ref name=thompson>{{cite web|url=http://tintin.eugraph.com/tqsect/feature/tvst|title=How to tell a Thompson from a Thomson|accessdate=9 September 2006}}</ref> They provide much of the [[comic relief]] throughout the series, being afflicted with chronic [[spoonerism]]s and comic [[pratfall]]s. They are thoroughly incompetent in their tasks, always bent on arresting the wrong character, but in spite of this they somehow get entrusted with delicate missions. The detectives usually wear bowler hats and carry walking sticks, except when abroad: during those missions they insist on wearing the "[[national costume|costume]]" of the locality they are visiting so as to blend into the local population, but instead manage to attire themselves in folkloric attire that actually makes them stand apart. The detectives were in part based on {{lang|fr|Herg<U+00E9>'s}} father Alexis and uncle L<U+00E9>on, identical twins who often took walks together wearing matching [[bowler hat]]s while carrying matching walking sticks.

* [[Bianca Castafiore]] is an opera singer whom Haddock absolutely despises. She seems to constantly be popping up wherever he goes, along with her maid Irma and pianist Igor Wagner. She is comically foolish, whimsical, absent-minded, and talkative, and seems unaware that her voice is shrill and appallingly loud. Her speciality is the Jewel Song (''{{lang|fr|Ah! je ris de me voir si belle en ce miroir}}'') from {{lang|fr|[[Charles Gounod|Gounod's]]}} opera, ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', and sings this at the least provocation, much to Haddock's dismay. She tends to be melodramatic in an exaggerated fashion and is often maternal toward Haddock, of whose dislike she remains ignorant. She often confuses words, especially names, with other words that rhyme with them or of which they remind her; "Haddock" is frequently replaced by [[malapropism]]s such as "[[Paddock]]", "Harrock", "[[Padlock]]", "[[Hopscotch]]", "[[Drydock]]", "[[Stopcock]]", "[[Maggot]]", "[[B<U+00E9>la Bart<U+00F3>k|Bart<U+00F3>k]]", "[[Hammock]]", and "[[Hemlock]]", while Nestor, Haddock's butler, is confused with "Chestor" and "Hector." Her own name means "white and chaste flower," a meaning to which Professor Calculus refers when he offers a white rose to the singer in ''[[The Castafiore Emerald]]''. She was based upon opera [[diva]]s in general (according to {{lang|fr|Herg<U+00E9>'s}} perception), {{lang|fr|Herg<U+00E9>'s}} Aunt Ninie who was known for her "shrill" singing of opera, and, in the post-war comics, on [[Maria Callas]].<ref name="Farr">{{cite journal | last =Farr | first =Michael | authorlink =Michael Farr | year =2004 | month =March | title =Thundering Typhoons | journal =History Today | volume =54 | issue =3 | page =62  | url = }}</ref>

* Other recurring characters include [[Nestor (Tintin character)|Nestor]] the butler, [[Chang Chong-Chen|Chang]] the loyal Chinese boy, [[Jolyon Wagg]] the infuriating (to Haddock) insurance salesman, [[General Alcazar]] the South American leader, [[Ben Kalish Ezab and Abdullah|Kalish Ezab]] the Arab emir, [[Ben Kalish Ezab and Abdullah|Abdullah]] the emir's mischievous son, [[Dr. J.W. M<U+00FC>ller]] the evil Nazi German doctor, [[Oliveira de Figueira]] the friendly salesman who can sell even the most trivial of items, [[Cutts the Butcher]] who is repeatedly telephoned by accident by Haddock and whose phone number is repeatedly confused with Haddock's, [[Rastapopoulos]], the criminal mastermind, and [[Allan Thompson|Allan]], Rastapopoulos' henchman and formerly Haddock's [[first mate]].

=== Settings ===
{{Main|Settings in The Adventures of Tintin}}
The settings within ''Tintin'' have also added depth to the strips. Herg<U+00E9> mingles real and fictional lands into his stories, along with a base in Belgium from where the heroes set off (originally 26 Labrador Road, but later [[Marlinspike Hall]]). This is best demonstrated in ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'', in which Herg<U+00E9> creates two fictional countries ([[Syldavia]] and [[Borduria]]) and invites the reader to tour them in text through the insertion of a travel brochure into the storyline.<ref name="Thompson250"/> Other fictional lands include [[San Theodoros]], [[San Paolo]], and [[Nuevo Rico]] in South America, the kingdom or [[administrative region]] of Gaipajama in India, and [[Khemed]] on the [[Arabian Peninsula]]<ref>McLaughlin, Jeff, ''Comics as Philosophy'', University Press of Mississippi, 2005, p.187</ref> which replaced the setting of [[Mandate Palestine]] used in the first edition of ''Land of Black Gold''. Along with these fictitious locations, actual nations were employed such as Belgium, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, Congo, Peru, India, Egypt, Indonesia, Nepal, Tibet, and China. Other actual locales used were the Sahara Desert, the Atlantic Ocean and the Moon.

== Research ==
Herg<U+00E9>'s extensive research began with ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'', Herg<U+00E9> stating: "it was from that time that I undertook research and really interested myself in the people and countries to which I sent Tintin, out of a sense of responsibility to my readers".<ref name="STCYL" />

Herg<U+00E9>'s use of research and photographic reference allowed him to build a realised universe for Tintin, going so far as to create fictionalised countries, dressing them with specific political cultures. These were heavily informed by the cultures evident in Herg<U+00E9>'s lifetime. Pierre Skilling has asserted that Herg<U+00E9> saw monarchy as "the legitimate form of government", noting that democratic "values seem underrepresented in [such] a classic Franco-Belgian strip".<ref>Skilling, Pierre (2005). "The Good Government According to Tintin." In Jeff (EDT) McLaughlin (Ed.) ''Comics As Philosophy'' pp. 173<U+2013>234.

Herg<U+00E9>'s use of research would include months of preparation for Tintin's voyage to the moon in the two-part storyline spread across ''[[Destination Moon (Tintin)|Destination Moon]]'' and ''[[Explorers on the Moon]]''. His research for the storyline was noted in ''[[New Scientist]]'': "The considerable research undertaken by Herg<U+00E9> enabled him to come very close to the type of space suit that would be used in future [[Exploration of the Moon|Moon exploration]], although his portrayal of the type of rocket that was actually used was a long way off the mark". The moon rocket is based on the German [[V2 rocket]]s.<ref>"Welcome to the Moon, Mr Armstrong". Pain, Stephanie ''[[New Scientist]]''. Vol. 182, no. 2441, pp. 48<U+2013>49. 3 April. 2004</ref>

== Influences ==
In his youth Herg<U+00E9> admired {{lang|fr|[[Benjamin Rabier]]}} and suggested that a number of images within ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'' reflected this influence, particularly the pictures of animals. {{lang|fr|Ren<U+00E9> Vincent}}, the [[Art Deco]] designer, also had an impact on early Tintin adventures: "His influence can be detected at the beginning of the ''Soviets'', where my drawings are designed along a decorative line, like an 'S'..".<ref name=lc>{{cite web|url=http://www.chez.com/tintim/ligneclaire/ligne_1.htm|title=Herg<U+00E9> et la ligne claire|language=French|accessdate =15 September 2006}}</ref> Herg<U+00E9> also felt no compunction in admitting that he had stolen the image of round noses from [[George McManus]], feeling they were "so much fun that I used them, without scruples!"<ref name="TCJInterview">{{cite journal | last =Sadoul  | first =Numa  | authorlink =Numa Sadoul  | coauthors =trans.

During the extensive research Herg<U+00E9> carried out for ''The Blue Lotus'', he became influenced by Chinese and Japanese illustrative styles and [[woodcut]]s. This is especially noticeable in the seascapes, which are reminiscent of works by [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.objectiftintin.com/whatsnew_Tintin_2868.lasso|title=Herg<U+00E9>, un grand dessinateur paysagiste|language=French|author=G.

Herg<U+00E9> also declared [[Mark Twain]] an influence, although this admiration may have led him astray when depicting [[Inca Empire|Incas]] as having no knowledge of an upcoming solar eclipse in ''[[Prisoners of the Sun]]'', an error attributed by T.F. Mills to an attempt to portray "Incas in awe of a latter-day '[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court|Connecticut Yankee]]'".<ref name="Mills" />

== Reception ==
=== Awards ===
On 1 June 2006, the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] bestowed the [[International Campaign for Tibet]]'s [[Light of Truth Award]] upon the character of Tintin, along with South African Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]].<ref name="bbclight">[[#BBC06|BBC News 2006]].</ref> The award was in recognition of Herg<U+00E9>'s book ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'', which the Executive Director of ICT Europe Tsering Jampa noted was "for many ... their introduction to the awe-inspiring landscape and culture of Tibet".<ref>[[#Int06|International Campaign for Tibet 2006]].</ref> In 2001 the Herg<U+00E9> Foundation demanded the recall of the Chinese translation of the work, which had been released with the title ''Tintin in China's Tibet''. The work was subsequently published with the correct translation of the title.<ref>[[#BBC02|BBC News 2002]].</ref> Accepting on behalf of the Herg<U+00E9> Foundation, Herg<U+00E9>'s widow Fanny Rodwell declared: "We never thought that this story of friendship would have a resonance more than 40 years later".<ref name="bbclight"/>

=== Tintinology and literary criticism ===
{{Main|List of books about Tintin}}
The study of ''The Adventures of Tintin'' is known as Tintinology, with its followers being varyingly known as Tintinologists, Tintinophiles, Tintinolators, Tintinites or Herg<U+00E9>logues.<ref name="Wagner 2006"/><ref>[[#Fre10|Freer 2010]].</ref> One notable Tintinologist is the Belgian [[Philippe Goddin]], who published ''Herg<U+00E9> et Tintin reporters: Du Petit vingti<U+00E8>me au Journal Tintin'' (1986, later republished in English as ''Herg<U+00E9> and Tintin Reporters: From "Le Petit Vingtieme" to "Tintin" Magazine'' in 1987) and ''Herg<U+00E9> et les Bigotudos'' (1993) amongst other books on the series. In 1983, [[Beno<U+00EE>t Peeters]] published ''Le Monde d'Herg<U+00E9>'', subsequently published in English as ''[[Tintin and the World of Herg<U+00E9>]]'' in 1988.<ref>[[#Pee88|Peeters 1988]].</ref> Although Goddin and Peeters were native French-speakers, the English reporter [[Michael Farr]] also published works on Tintinology such as ''Tintin, 60 Years of Adventure'' (1989), ''Tintin: The Complete Companion'' (2001),<ref>[[#Far01|Farr 2001]].</ref> ''Tintin & Co.'' (2007)<ref>[[#Far07|Farr 2007]].</ref> and ''The Adventures of Herg<U+00E9>'' (2007), as had English screenwriter [[Harry Thompson]], the author of ''Tintin: Herg<U+00E9> and his Creation'' (1991).<ref>[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]].</ref>

''The Adventures of Tintin'' have also been examined by [[literary criticism|literary critics]], primarily in French-speaking Europe. In 1984, Jean-Marie Apostolid<U+00E8>s published his study of the ''Adventures of Tintin'' from a more "adult" perspective as ''Les M<U+00E9>tamorphoses de Tintin'', although it would only appear in English as ''The Metamorphoses of Tintin, or Tintin for Adults'' in 2010.<ref>[[#Apo10|Apostolid<U+00E8>s 2010]].</ref> In reviewing Apostolid<U+00E8>s' book, Nathan Perl-Rosenthal of ''[[The New Republic]]'' thought that it was "not for the faint of heart: it is densely-packed with close textual analysis and laden with psychological jargon."<ref>[[#Per10|Perl-Rosenthal 2010]].</ref> Following Apostolid<U+00E8>s's work, French psychoanalyst Serge Tisseron examined the series in his books ''Tintin et les Secrets de Famille'' ("Tintin and the Family Secrets"), which was published in 1990,<ref>[[#Tis90|Tisseron 1990]].</ref> and ''Tintin et le Secret d'Herg<U+00E9>'' ("Tintin and Herg<U+00E9>'s Secret"), published in 1993.<ref>[[#Tis93|Tisseron 1993]].</ref> 

The first English-language work of literary criticism devoted to the series was ''Tintin and the Secret of Literature'', written by the novelist [[Tom McCarthy (writer)|Tom McCarthy]] and published in 2006. In this book, McCarthy compares Herg<U+00E9>'s work with that of [[Aeschylus]], [[Honor<U+00E9> de Balzac]], [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[Henry James]] and argues that the series contains the key to understanding literature itself.<ref>[[#McC06|McCarthy 2006]]. p. 10.</ref> McCarthy considered the ''Adventures of Tintin'' to be "stupendously rich",<ref>[[#McC06|McCarthy 2006]]. p. 08.</ref> containing "a mastery of plot and symbol, theme and sub-text"<ref>[[#McC06|McCarthy 2006]]. p. 32.</ref> which, influenced by Tisseron's psychoanalytical readings of the work, he believed could be deciphered to reveal a series of recurring themes, ranging from [[bartering]]<ref>[[#McC06|McCarthy 2006]]. pp. 13<U+2013>14.</ref> to implicit sexual intercourse<ref>[[#McC06|McCarthy 2006]]. pp. 106<U+2013>109.</ref> that Herg<U+00E9> had featured throughout the series. Reviewing the book in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', Toby Clements argued however that McCarthy's work, and literary criticism of Herg<U+00E9>'s comic strips in general, cut "perilously close" to simply feeding "the appetite of those willing to cross the line between enthusiast and obsessive" in the Tintinological community.<ref name="Clements 2006"/>

=== Controversy ===
The earliest stories in ''The Adventures of Tintin'' have been criticised for both displaying animal cruelty as well as [[racism|racial stereotypes]], violent, [[colonialism|colonialist]], and even fascist leanings, including caricatured portrayals of non-Europeans. While the Herg<U+00E9> Foundation has presented such criticism as na<U+00EF>vet<U+00E9>,<ref name="Thompson">{{cite book | last=Thompson | first=Harry | authorlink=Harry Thompson | year=1991 | title=Tintin: Herg<U+00E9> & His Creation | edition=First | publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|isbn=0-340-52393-X }}</ref> and scholars of Herg<U+00E9> such as Harry Thompson have claimed that "Herg<U+00E9> did what he was told by the [[Norbert Wallez|Abb<U+00E9> Wallez]]",<ref name="Thompson"/> Herg<U+00E9> himself felt that his background made it impossible to avoid prejudice, stating that "I was fed the prejudices of the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society that surrounded me."<ref name="TCJInterview"/>

In ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'', the [[Bolsheviks]] were presented without exception as villains. Herg<U+00E9> drew on ''Moscow Unveiled'', a work given to him by Wallez and authored by [[Joseph Douillet]], the former Belgian consul in Russia, that is highly critical of the [[Soviet]] regime, although Herg<U+00E9> contextualised this by noting that in Belgium, at the time a devout Catholic nation, "Anything Bolshevik was [[atheism|atheist]]".<ref name="TCJInterview"/> In the story, Bolshevik leaders are motivated only by personal greed and by a desire to deceive the world. Tintin discovers, buried, "the hideout where [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]], and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] have collected together wealth stolen from the people". Herg<U+00E9> later dismissed the failings of this first story as "a transgression of my youth".<ref name="Thompson" /> By 1999, some part of this presentation was being noted as far more reasonable, with British weekly newspaper ''[[The Economist]]'' declaring: "In retrospect, however, the land of hunger and tyranny painted by Herg<U+00E9> was uncannily accurate".<ref>[[#Eco99|''The Economist'' 1999]].</ref>

''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'' has been criticised as presenting the [[Belgian Congo|Africans]] as na<U+00EF>ve and primitive. In the original work, Tintin is shown at a blackboard addressing a class of African children. "Mes chers amis," he says, "je vais vous parler aujourd'hui de votre patrie: La Belgique" ("My dear friends, I am going to talk to you today about your fatherland: Belgium"). Herg<U+00E9> redrew this in 1946 to show a lesson in [[mathematics]].<ref>[[#Cen10|Cendrowicz 2010]].</ref><ref>[[#Far01|Farr 2001]]. p. 25.</ref> Herg<U+00E9> later admitted the flaws in the original story, excusing it by noting: "I portrayed these Africans according to ... this purely paternalistic spirit of the time".<ref name="TCJInterview" /> The perceived problems with this book were summarised by Sue Buswell in 1988<ref>''Mail on Sunday'' Associated Newspapers 27 November 1988</ref> as being "all to do with rubbery lips and heaps of dead animals" although Thompson noted this quote may have been "taken out of context".<ref name="Thompson" /> "Dead animals" refers to the fashion for big game hunting at the time of the work's original publication. Drawing on [[Andr<U+00E9> Maurois]]' ''Les Silences du colonel Bramble'', Herg<U+00E9> presents Tintin as a [[big-game hunter]], accidentally killing fifteen [[antelope]] as opposed to the one needed for the evening meal. However, concerns over the number of dead animals did lead the Scandinavian publishers of Tintin's adventures to request changes. A page which presented Tintin killing a [[rhinoceros]] by drilling a hole in the animal's back and inserting a stick of dynamite was deemed excessive, and Herg<U+00E9> substituted a page in which the rhino accidentally discharges Tintin's rifle while he slept under a tree.<ref name="FarrCompanion">[[Michael Farr]] ''Tintin: The Complete Companion'', John Murray (2001) ISBN 0-7195-5522-1</ref> In 2007 the UK's [[Commission for Racial Equality]] called for the book to be pulled from the shelves after a complaint, stating that "it beggars belief that in this day and age that any shop would think it acceptable to sell and display 'Tintin In The Congo'."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6294670.stm |title='Bid to ban "racist" Tintin book' on the BBC News website |accessdate=12 July 2007 | date=12 July 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cre.gov.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew0vq.RefLocID-0hg00900c002.Lang-EN.htm |title=CRE statement on the children's book 'Tintin In The Congo' on the CRE website |accessdate=12 July 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071212081108/http://www.cre.gov.uk/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew0vq.RefLocID-0hg00900c002.Lang-EN.htm |archivedate = 12 December 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> In August 2007, a complaint was filed in Brussels, Belgium, by a Congolese student, claiming the book was an insult to the Congolese people.

Some of the early albums were altered by Herg<U+00E9> in subsequent editions, usually at the demand of publishers. For example, at the instigation of his American publishers, many of the black characters in ''[[Tintin in America]]'' were re-coloured to make their race white or ambiguous.<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.regiments.org/special/essays/tbibeng.htm|title = The Adventures of Tintin: A History of the Anglo-American Editions|author=T.F.Mills|date=1 February 1996|accessdate =14 September 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060710195223/http://www.regiments.org/special/essays/tbibeng.htm |archivedate = 10 July 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> ''The Shooting Star'' album originally had an American villain with the Jewish surname of "Blumenstein". This proved to be controversial, as the character exhibited exaggerated [[stereotype|stereotypically]] Jewish characteristics. "Blumenstein" was changed to an American with a less ethnically specific name, [[Mr. Bohlwinkel]], in later editions and subsequently to a South American of a [[fictional country]] <U+2013> S<U+00E3>o Rico. Herg<U+00E9> later discovered that 'Bohlwinkel' was also a Jewish name.<ref name="defense" />

Nazi collaborator SS officer [[L<U+00E9>on Degrelle]] published a book insisting that he was [[Tintin (character)#Inspiration|Herg<U+00E9>'s model]] for the character Tintin.

== Adaptations and memorabilia ==
{{Main|Tintin books, films, and media}}
''The Adventures of Tintin'' has been adapted in a variety of media besides the original comic strip and its collections. Herg<U+00E9> encouraged adaptations and members of his studio working on the animated films. After Herg<U+00E9>'s death, the Herg<U+00E9> Foundation became responsible for authorising adaptations and exhibitions.<ref name=tintin.com>{{cite web | url=http://tintin.francetv.fr/uk/ | title=Tintin.com | accessdate =9 September 2006 }}</ref>

===Television and radio===
Two animated television series have been made, both adaptations of the comic strips rather than original stories. The first was ''[[Herg<U+00E9>'s Adventures of Tintin]]'', produced by [[Belvision Studios|Belvision]]. The series aired from 1958 to 1962, with 104 five-minute episodes produced. It was adapted by Charles Shows and then translated into French by [[Greg (comics)|Greg]] (Michel Regnier), then editor-in-chief of ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine. This series has been criticised for differing too greatly from the original books and for its poor animation.<ref name=pbs /> The second series was ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'', featuring twenty-one of the stories. It ran for three seasons (from 1991 to 1992), was co-directed by St<U+00E9>phane Bernasconi and [[Peter Hudecki]], and was produced by [[L<U+00E9> Studio Ellipse|Ellipse]] (France), and [[Nelvana Limited|Nelvana]] (Canada), on behalf of La Fondation Herg<U+00E9>. Traditional animation techniques were used on the series, adhering closely to the books to such an extent that some frames from the original albums were transposed directly to screen. The series was successful and it has aired in over fifty countries and was released on DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belgium.be/eportal/application?languageParameter=en&pageid=contentPage&docId=25548

The British Broadcasting Corporation produced two "The Adventures of Tintin" series in 1992 and 1993 starring [[Richard Pearce (British actor)|Richard Pearce]] as Tintin and [[Andrew Sachs]] as Snowy. Captain Haddock was played by [[Leo McKern]] in Series One and [[Lionel Jeffries]] in Series Two, Professor Calculus was played by [[Stephen Moore (actor)|Stephen Moore]] and The Thompsons were played by [[Charles Kay]]. This series aired in the US on [[HBO]].

===Documentaries===
Two documentaries have been made about Tintin and his creator Herg<U+00E9>.
* ''[[I, Tintin]]'' (1976), a French documentary
* ''[[Tintin and I]]'' ({{lang|fr|''Tintin et Moi''}}), by Danish director Anders H<U+00F8>gsbro <U+00D8>stergaard in 2003, a co-production of companies from Denmark, Belgium, France, and Switzerland. This documentary was based on a taped interview with Herg<U+00E9> by [[Numa Sadoul]] from 1971. Although the interview was published as a book, Herg<U+00E9> was allowed to edit the work prior to publishing and much of the interview was excised.<ref name=boyscout>{{cite web | last=Christensen | first=Af | month=November | year=2003 | url=http://www.dfi.dk/tidsskriftetfilm/32/boyscout.htm | title=Boy scout with strange dreams <U+2013> "Tintin et moi"|accessdate =9 September 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060513183503/http://www.dfi.dk/tidsskriftetfilm/32/boyscout.htm |archivedate = 13 May 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The documentary was broadcast in the United States as "Tintin and I" on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] network, 11 July 2006.<ref name=pbs>{{cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2006/tintinandi/index.html | title=''Tintin'' and I at PBS | accessdate =9 September 2006 }}</ref>

=== Theatre ===
Herg<U+00E9> himself helped to create two Tintin stage plays; ''Tintin in India: The Mystery of the Blue Diamond'' (1941) and ''The Disappearance of Mr. Boullock'' (1941<U+2013>1942), both of which were written with [[Jacques Van Melkebeke]] and performed in [[Brussels]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Sadoul |first=Numa |authorlink=Numa Sadoul |title=Tintin et moi: entretiens avec Herg<U+00E9> |year=1975 |publisher=[[Casterman]] |language=French |page=143}}</ref> In the late 1970s and early 1980s, two Tintin plays appeared in London, adapted by Geoffrey Case for the Unicorn Theatre Company <U+2013> these were ''Tintin's Great American Adventure'', based on the comic ''[[Tintin in America]]'', which was shown across 1976<U+2013>1977, and ''Tintin and the Black Island'', which was based on ''[[The Black Island]]'' and shown in 1980.

=== Exhibitions ===
Herg<U+00E9>'s work on Tintin has formed the basis of many exhibitions, with the Herg<U+00E9> Foundation creating a mobile exhibition in 1991. "The World of Herg<U+00E9>" is described by the Foundation as being "an excellent introduction to Herg<U+00E9>'s work". Materials from this exhibition have also formed the basis for larger shows, namely "Herg<U+00E9> the Draughtsman", an exhibition to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Tintin's creation, and the more recent "In Tibet With Tintin". In 2001 the [[Mus<U+00E9>e de la Marine]] staged an exhibition of items related to the sea which had inspired Herg<U+00E9>. In 2002 the [[Bunkamura]] Museum of Art in Japan staged an exhibition of original drawings, as well as of the submarine and rocket ship invented in the strips by Professor Calculus. [[Barcelona]] has also hosted an exhibition on Tintin and the sea, "llamp de rellamp" at the Maritime Museum in 2003.<ref name="tintin.com" />

2004 saw exhibitions in Holland, "Tintin and the Incas" at the Royal Museum of Ethnology; the "Tintin in the City" exhibition in the Halles Saint G<U+00E9>ry in Brussels; and an exhibition focusing on Tintin's exploits at sea at the [[National Maritime Museum]] in London.<ref name="tintin.com" /> The latter exhibition was in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the publication of Tintin's first adventure, and was organised in partnership with the Herg<U+00E9> Foundation.<ref name=nationalmaritime>{{cite web | url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.11356 | title=The Adventures of Tintin at Sea <U+2013> a major new exhibition at the National Maritime Museum|accessdate =9 September 2006 }}</ref> 2004 also saw the [[Belgian Centre for Comic Strip Art]] add an area dedicated to Herg<U+00E9>.<ref name="tintin.com" />

The 100th anniversary of Herg<U+00E9>'s birth is commemorated with a large exhibition at the Paris museum for contemporary arts, [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], from 20 December 2006 until 19 February 2007, featuring all 120 original pages of ''[[The Blue Lotus]]''.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20061220/ts_afp/afpentertainmentfrancebelgiumexhibitioncartoontintin Yahoo News on Pompidou exhibition]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref>

=== Memorabilia and merchandise ===
[[Image:Tintin's dog.jpg|thumb|left|Soft toy versions of Snowy ''(Milou)'']]

Images from the series have long been [[license]]d for use on [[merchandise]]; the success of the ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine helping to create a market for such items.  Tintin's image has been used to sell a wide variety of products, from alarm clocks to underpants.<ref>{{cite news | first=Peter | last=Conrad | title=He'll never act his age | date= 7 March 2004|work=The Observer |location=London |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/childrenandteens/story/0,,1163706,00.html }}</ref> There are now estimated to be over 250 separate items related to the character available, with some becoming [[collectible|collectors]] items in their own right.<ref>"Tintin and the till bells; Shopping"
''[[The Times]]'' (London); 12 November 1994; Denise Elphick;</ref>

Since Herg<U+00E9>'s death, the Herg<U+00E9> Foundation have maintained control of the licenses, through [[Moulinsart]], the commercial wing of the foundation. Speaking in 2002, [[Peter Horemans]], the then director general at Moulinsart, noted this control: "We have to be very protective of the property. We don<U+2019>t take lightly any potential partners and we have to be very selective ... for him to continue to be as popular as he is, great care needs to be taken of his use."<ref>{{cite press release | title =Tintin praises volunteer efforts | publisher =Dyslexia International <U+2013> Tools and Technologies | url =http://www.ditt-online.org/Archives/DITT%20Newsletter%20No9.pdf|accessdate =2 September 2006 |format=PDF}}</ref> However, the Foundation has been criticised by scholars as "trivialising the work of Herg<U+00E9> by concentrating on the more lucrative merchandising" in the wake of a move in the late 1990s to charge them for using relevant images to illustrate their papers on the series.<ref>"This life: That's Tintin on the far right A battle is raging for Tintin's soul. Is he a French hero or a fascist propaganda tool?" ''[[The Observer]]'' (London); 3 January 1999; Martin Bright; p. 004</ref>

[[NBC Universal]] acquired the rights to all of ''The Adventures of Tintin'' merchandise in North America.

[[Image:Tintin Shop.jpg|thumb|The Tintin Shop in [[Covent Garden]], London]]

Tintin [[memorabilia]] and merchandise has allowed a chain of stores based solely on the character to become viable. The first shop was launched in 1984 in [[Covent Garden]], London. 
Tintin shops have also opened in both [[Bruges]] and [[Brussels]] in Belgium, and in [[Montpellier]], France. The British bookstore chain, [[Ottakar's]], founded in 1987, was named after the character of King Ottokar from the Tintin book ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]'', and their shops stocked a large amount of Tintin merchandise till their takeover by [[Waterstone's]] in 2006.<ref>"Tintin Among The Geriatrics Kitty Holland celebrates the 70th birthday of Belgium's favourite son, and France's beloved adoptee, Tintin" ''[[Irish Times]]'' (Dublin); 9 January 1999; p. 62</ref>

=== Stamps and coinage ===
{{Main|Tintin on postage stamps}}

Tintin's image has been used on postage stamps on numerous occasions, the first issued by the [[Belgian Post Group|Belgian Post]] in 1979 to celebrate the day of youth [[philately]].<ref>[[#Ken91|Kennealy 1991]].</ref>  This was the first in a series of stamps with the images of [[Belgian comics|Belgian comic heroes]], and was the first stamp in the world to feature a comic book hero. In 1999, the [[TNT N.V.|Royal Dutch Post]] released two stamps, based upon the ''[[Destination Moon (Tintin)|Destination Moon]]'' adventure, with the stamps selling out within hours of release. The French post office, Poste Fran<U+00E7>aise, then issued a stamp of Tintin and Snowy in 2001. To mark the end of the Belgian Franc, and also to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the publication of ''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'', two more stamps were issued by the Belgian Post on 31 December 2001. The stamps were also issued in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] at the same time. 2002 saw the French Post issue stamped envelopes featuring Tintin, whilst in 2004 the Belgian post-office celebrated its own seventy-fifth anniversary, as well as the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of ''[[Explorers on the Moon]]'' and the thirty-fifth anniversary of the moon landings with a series of stamps based upon the ''Explorers on the Moon'' adventure.<ref>"Tintin celebrates 75th birthday in Belgium" ''[[Irish Times]]'' (Dublin); 10 January 2004; TIM KING; p. 9.</ref> In 2007, to celebrate Herg<U+00E9>'s centennial, Belgium, France and Switzerland all plan to issue special stamps in commemoration.<ref>{{cite news | last=AP | title=Tintin creator's centenary|date=24 May 2006 |work=The Age |location=Australia | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/tintin-creators-anniversary/2006/05/24/1148150265203.html }}</ref>

Besides stamps, Tintin has also been [[Commemorative coins of Belgium|commemorated by coin]] several times. In 1995, [[Monnaie de Paris]] issued a set of 12 silver medallions to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Herg<U+00E9>'s death, which were available in a limited edition of 5000. Another coin was released to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Tintin book ''[[Explorers on the Moon]]'', again in a limited run, this time of 10,000. Belgium minted a limited edition commemorative coin to celebrate the 75th birthday of Tintin in January 2004.<ref name=Coin>{{cite news | title=Euro coin honours Tintin and Snowy | date= 8 January 2004 |publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3379959.stm }}</ref> The coin, composed of silver and featuring Tintin and Snowy, was limited to a minting of 50,000. Although it has a face value of <U+20AC>10, it is, as with other commemorative euro coins of this type (i.e. not a commemorative issue of a standard [[euro coins|euro coin]]), only legal tender in the country in which it was issued <U+2013> in this case, Belgium.<ref name=Coin/>

=== Parody and pastiche ===
{{Main|List of Tintin parodies and pastiches}}
[[File:Frame from Breaking Free.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A frame from ''Breaking Free'', a [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] comic that parodies the ''Adventures of Tintin'']]

During Herg<U+00E9>'s lifetime, parodies were produced of the ''Adventures of Tintin'', with one of the earliest appearing in Belgian newspaper ''La Patrie'' after the liberation of the country from Nazi German occupation in September 1944. Entitled ''Tintin au Pays de Nazis'' ("Tintin in the Land of the Nazis"), the short and crudely drawn strip lampoons Herg<U+00E9> for working for a Nazi-run newspaper during the occupation.<ref>[[#McC06|McCarthy 2006]]. pp. 186<U+2013>187.</ref>

Following Herg<U+00E9>'s death, hundreds more unofficial parodies and pastiches of the ''Adventures of Tintin'' were produced, covering a wide variety of different genres.<ref name=Coxhead>[[#Cox07|Coxhead 2007]].</ref> Tom McCarthy divided such works into three specific groupings: those which are pornographic, those which are political, and those which are artistic.<ref name="McCarthy 2006. p. 186">[[#McC06|McCarthy 2006]]. p. 186.</ref> In a number of cases, the actual name "Tintin" is replaced by something similar, like Nitnit, Timtim or Quinquin, within these books.<ref name=Coxhead>[[#Cox07|Coxhead 2007]].</ref> Some of these parodies, such as 1976's ''Tintin en Suisse'' ("Tintin in Switzerland") and Jan Bucquoy's 1992 work ''La Vie Sexuelle de Tintin'' ("The Sexual Life of Tintin") are pornographic in content, featuring Tintin and the other characters engaged in sexual acts.<ref name=Coxhead>[[#Cox07|Coxhead 2007]].</ref><ref name="McCarthy 2006. p. 186"/><ref>[[#Per06|Perotte and Van Gong 2006]].</ref> Another such example of a Tintin parody was ''[[Tintin in Thailand]]'', in which Tintin, Haddock and Calculus travel to the East Asian country for a [[sex holiday]]. The book circulated from December 1999 onwards, but in 2001 Belgian police arrested those responsible and confiscated 650 copies for copyright violation.<ref name=bbc2>[[#BBC01|BBC News 2001]].</ref>

Other parodies have been produced for political reasons, for instance ''Tintin in Iraq'' lampoons the world politics of the early 21st century, with Herg<U+00E9>'s character General Alcazar representing President of the United States [[George W. Bush]].<ref name=Coxhead>[[#Cox07|Coxhead 2007]].</ref> Written by the pseudonymous Jack Daniels, ''[[The Adventures of Tintin: Breaking Free|Breaking Free]]'' (1989) is a [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] comic set in Britain during the 1980s, with Tintin and his uncle (modelled after Captain Haddock) being working class Englishmen who turn to socialism in order to oppose the capitalist policies of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]]. When first published in Britain, it caused an outrage in the mainstream press, with one paper issuing the headline that "Commie nutters turn Tintin into picket yob!"<ref name=Coxhead>[[#Cox07|Coxhead 2007]].</ref>

Other comic creators have chosen to create stories that are more like [[fan fiction]] than parody. The Swiss comic creator Exem has produced a series of adventures about Tintin's "evil twin" Zinzin.<ref name=Coxhead>[[#Cox07|Coxhead 2007]].</ref> Similarly, the Canadian comic book writer and illustrator [[Yves Rodier]] has produced a number of Tintin works, none of which have been authorised by the Herg<U+00E9> Foundation, including a 1986 "completion" of the unfinished ''Tintin and Alph-art'', which he drew in imitation of Herg<U+00E9>'s ''ligne-clair'' style.<ref name=Coxhead>[[#Cox07|Coxhead 2007]].</ref>

The response to these parodies has been mixed in the Tintinological community. Many Tintinologists despise them, seeing them as an affront to Herg<U+00E9>'s work,<ref name=Coxhead>[[#Cox07|Coxhead 2007]].</ref> with this being the view taken by Nick Rodwell of the Studio Herg<U+00E9>, who declared that "None of these copyists count as true fans of Herg<U+00E9>. If they were, they would respect his wishes that no one but him draw Tintin's adventures."<ref name=Coxhead>[[#Cox07|Coxhead 2007]].</ref> Where possible, Studio Herg<U+00E9> have taken legal action against those known to be producing such items. Other Tintinologists have however taken a different attitude, considering such parodies and pastiches to be tributes to Herg<U+00E9>, and collecting them has become a "niche speciality".<ref name=Coxhead>[[#Cox07|Coxhead 2007]].</ref>

== Translation into English ==
Tintin first appeared in English in the weekly children's comic [[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]] in 1951 in Vol 2:17 (3 August) and it ran in weekly parts in the lower half of the centrefold, beneath the cutaway drawings, until Vol 3:5 (9 May 1952). It was translated by a Frenchman in conjunction with [[Casterman]], Tintin's publishers, and starts by describing Tintin as "a French boy". Snowy was called by his French name "Milou".<ref> Howard Corn. ''Eagle Times'' magazine. Vol:2 No.4 <U+2013> Christmas Issue 1989.</ref>

The process of [[translating]] Tintin into English was then commissioned in 1958 by [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen & Co. Ltd.]] of London. It was a joint-operation, headed by Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/6029763/Michael-Turner.html |title=Telegraph obituary |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=7 October 2010}}</ref> who worked closely with Herg<U+00E9> to attain an accurate translation as true as possible to the original work.<ref name="trans">{{cite web|url=http://www.tintinologist.org/articles/mt-llc-interview.html|title=Interview with Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper|author=Chris Owens|publisher=tintinologist.org|date=10 July 2004|accessdate =15 September 2006}}</ref> The works were also sold in the American market by [[Golden Books]], a branch of the [[Western Publishing Company]] in the 1950s. The albums were translated from French into [[American English]] with some blocks blanked except for the speech balloons. This was done to remove content considered to be inappropriate for children, such as drunkenness and free mixing of races.<ref name="changes">{{cite web |url=http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/TINTIN.html|title=Tintin|publisher=CWI| accessdate=5 January 2007}}</ref> The albums were not very popular and only six were published in mixed order.<ref name="changes2">{{cite web|url=http://www.tintinologist.org/articles/goldenpress.html|title=Tintin crosses the Atlantic: The Golden Press affair|publisher=tintinologist.org| accessdate=5 January 2007}}</ref> The edited albums later had their blanked blocks redrawn by Herg<U+00E9> to be more acceptable, and they currently appear this way in published editions around the world. [[The Atlantic Monthly|Atlantic Monthly Press]], in cooperation with [[Little, Brown and Company]] beginning in the 1970s, published the albums again. This time, the text features the originally translated [[British English]] text with alterations to non-universally understood words such as [[gaol]], [[tyre (wheel)|tyre]], [[saloon (car)|saloon]] and [[wrench|spanner]]. Currently, they are being published under the Joy Street imprint of Little, Brown and Company.

Due in part to the large amount of language-specific [[word play]] (such as punning) in the series, especially the jokes which played on [[Professor Calculus]]' partial deafness, it was always the intention not to translate literally, instead striving to sculpt a work whose idioms and jokes would be meritorious in their own right; however, in spite of the free hand Herg<U+00E9> afforded the two, they worked closely with the original text, asking for regular assistance to understand Herg<U+00E9>'s intentions.<ref name="trans" />

More than simple translations, however, the English versions were anglicised to appeal to British customs and values. Milou, for example, was renamed Snowy at the translators' discretion. Moreover, the translation process served to colour the imagery within the book; the opportunity was taken to make scenes set in Britain more true-to-life, such as ensuring that the British police were [[Police use of firearms in the United Kingdom|unarmed]], and ensuring scenes of the British [[countryside]] were more accurate for discerning British readers.<ref name="trans" />

Unlike in the United Kingdom, the books have always had very limited popularity in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7820247.stm |title=UK &#124; Magazine &#124; Confused by the cult of Tintin? You're not alone |publisher=BBC News |date=9 January 2009 |accessdate=5 December 2009}}</ref> However, from 1966 to 1979 [[Children's Digest]] included monthly installments of The Adventures of Tintin. These serializations served to greatly increase Tintin<U+2019>s popularity in the United States.  At that time Children's Digest had a circulation of around 700,000 copies monthly.<ref>[http://www.tintinologist.org/articles/goldenpress.html Tintin Crosses The Atlantic: The Golden Press Affair]</ref>

== Legacy ==
Tintin and his creator Herg<U+00E9> have inspired many artists within comics. Most notably, Herg<U+00E9>'s [[ligne claire]] style has proven influential. Contributors to the ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine have employed ligne claire, and more recently, [[Jacques Tardi]], [[Yves Chaland]], [[Jason Little (cartoonist)|Jason Little]], [[Phil Elliott]], [[Martin Handford]], [[Geof Darrow]], Eric Heuvel, and [[Garen Ewing]] have produced works utilising it.

Tintin's legacy includes the establishment of a market for comic strip collections; the serialisation followed by collection model has been adopted by creators and publishers in France and Belgium. This system allows for greater financial stability, as creators receive money whilst working. This rivals the American and British model of [[work for hire]]. [[Roger Sabin]] has argued that this model allowed for "in theory ... a better quality product".<ref>{{cite book | last=Sabin | first=Roger | authorlink=Roger Sabin | year=1996 | title= Comics, Comix & Graphic Novels| edition=2005|publisher=Phaidon|isbn=0-7148-3993-0  }}</ref> [[Paul Gravett]] has also noted that the use of detailed reference material and a picture archive, which Herg<U+00E9> implemented from ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'' onwards, was "a turning point ... in the maturing of the medium as a whole".<ref name="STCYL"/>

In the wider art world, both [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] have claimed Herg<U+00E9> as one of their most important influences. Lichtenstein made paintings based on fragments from Tintin's comics, whilst Warhol utilised the ligne claire and even made a series of paintings with Herg<U+00E9> as subject. He declared: "Herg<U+00E9> has influenced my work in the same way as [[Walt Disney]]. For me, Herg<U+00E9> was more than a comic strip artist".<ref name=bbc3>{{cite news | date=10 January 1999|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/252066.stm|title=Tintin's 70 years of adventure|work=BBC News | accessdate =9 September 2006 }}</ref>

In music, Tintin has been the inspiration to a number of bands and musicians. A British 1980s pop band took the name [[Thompson Twins]] after the Tintin characters.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Dave|title=Rock Formations|publisher=Cidermill Books|year=2004|isbn=0974848352}}</ref> [[Stephen Duffy]], lead singer of [[Duran Duran]] before they struck fame, had a UK number 4 hit with "Kiss Me" under the name Stephen "Tintin" Duffy; he had to drop the nickname, however, under pressure of a copyright infringement suit.<ref>"Duffy, Stephen".

[http://www.webcitation.org/5bILAkSNl Archived] on 10 March 2008.</ref> An Australian [[psychedelic rock]] band and an American independent [[progressive rock]] band have used the name "[[Tin Tin (band)|Tin Tin]]", and British electronic dance music duo [[Tin Tin Out]] was similarly inspired by the character. South African singer/songwriter [[Gert Vlok Nel]] compares Tintin to God in his [[Afrikaans]] song "Waarom ek roep na jou vanaand", presumably because Tintin is a morally pure character.  

Australian cartoonist [[Bill Leak]] often portrays Australia's round-faced former prime minister and subsequent foreign minister,  [[Kevin Rudd]], as Tintin.

Herg<U+00E9> has been lauded as "creating in art a powerful graphic record of the 20th century's tortured history" through his work on Tintin.<ref name=pbs2>{{cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2006/tintinandi/about.html | title=Tintin and I.

On 30 May 2010, a life-sized bronze statue of Tintin and Snowy, and more than 200 other Tintin items, including many original panels by Herg<U+00E9>, sold for 1.08 million euros ($1.3 million USD) at a Paris auction.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/books/story/2010/05/30/tintin-sale.html | work=CBC News | title=Tintin auction in Paris fetches .3M | date=30 May 2010}}</ref>
