'''Jim Mothersbaugh''' (born January 18, 1956 in [[Akron, Ohio]]) was the second drummer for [[Devo]], replacing [[Rod Reisman]] who only played for a single show.  Jim joined Devo with his older brothers, [[Bob Mothersbaugh|Bob]] and [[Mark Mothersbaugh|Mark]].

Jim appears on several early Devo demos. Later he performed as an equipment technician for the band on the 1980 tour, and worked at [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] through much of the 1980s helping to develop [[MIDI]] technology.

He is currently living in [[Akron, Ohio]] raising his family, one son and one daughter, and still makes time to make appearances at the DE-VOtionals - an annual Devo fan gathering in Ohio which has been held in both Akron and Cleveland.
