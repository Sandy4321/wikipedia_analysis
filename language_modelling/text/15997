'''''At Newport 1960''''' is a live album by [[Muddy Waters]] performed at [[Newport Jazz Festival]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] with his backing band, consisting of [[Otis Spann]] (piano, vocals), [[Pat Hare]] (guitar), [[James Cotton]] (harmonica), Andrew Stevens (bass) and [[Francis Clay]] (drums), in July 3. Water's performances across Europe in the 50s and at Newport helped popularize [[blues]] to broader audience, especially to whites.  The album is often said to be one of the first blues live albums.

The album was released in the US on November 15 that year, featuring eight songs, from "I Got My Brand On You" to "Goodbye Newport Blues". In 2001, [[record label]] [[Chess Records|Chess]] released a remastered version, which includes three bonus tracks recorded in Chicago in June. Although ''At Newport 1960'' never charted, it received critical acclaim and was influential for future bands. It was ranked on several music lists, including at number 348 on ''Rolling Stones'' "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|The 500 Greatest Albums of all Time]]" in 2003.

==History, recording and release==
After releasing his debut album ''[[The Best of Muddy Waters]]'' (1958), a [[greatest hits]] collection, and ''[[Sings Big Bill Broonzy]]'' (1969), a collection of [[cover (music)|covers]] of songs by blues musician [[Big Bill Broonzy]], Waters decided to perform at the live concert [[Newport Jazz Festival]].{{sfn|Capace|2001|p=315}} Waters had already been a well-known blues musician across Europe and the United States in the 50s. His successful performances with his [[electric blues]] band, consisting of half brother [[Otis Spann]] (piano, vocals), [[Pat Hare]] (guitar), [[James Cotton]] (harmonica), Andrew Stevens (bass) and [[Francis Clay]] (drums), increasingly popularized the blues in the mainstream music of United States and Europe, especially to the white audience.{{sfn|Smith|2009|p=15<U+2013>17}}

The gig was scheduled on July 3, Sunday afternoon. The day before, performances by [[Ray Charles]] and singing group [[Lambert, Hendricks and Ross]] were met with crowd rushes. About 300 drunken [[hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]]s made an uproar during Charles' performance caused by poor police security. The policemen attacked with [[teargas]] and [[water hose]]s. The riots became so out of control that the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] was called in at midnight to calm the crowd.  When Waters and his band arrived on the scheduled day, they intended to drive back on the next day, until driver [[James Cotton]] saw [[John Lee Hooker]] standing at a corner, his guitar on his back without a guitar case. Cotton said Hooker should get into his car to get the musicians out of harm's way. At the same time, the city council decided to cancel the concert, but concert promoter George Wein convinced them when he said that the [[United States Information Agency]] (USIA) planned to film the festival to teach the American culture in other countries.{{sfn|Gordon|2003|pp=197<U+2013>199}}

Before Waters' performance, his band backed [[Otis Spann]], who was the band leader, and John Lee Hooker. About 17 P.M., Waters entered the stage, wearing black, while the rest of the band white formal dresses. ''At Newport 1960'' opens with then-unreleased "I Got My Brand on You", which was recorded one month prior, and "[[(I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man]]", both written by [[Willie Dixon]]. Next are the [[Big Joe Williams]] cover "[[Baby Please Don't Go]]", [[St. Louis Jimmy Oden|Oden]]'s "Soon Forgotten", Dixon's "Tiger in Your Tank" and Broonzy's "I Feel So Good". During the latter he performed hip swings, and during "[[I've Got My Mojo Working]]", which he played a second time, he performed Elgin movements, then a [[foxtrot]] with Cotton. At the end he [[jitterbug]]ed, and when he returned to the microphone and performed the move a second time, he received massive cheers by the audience. At the end of this song, every bluesmen gathered at the stage to perform [[medley (music)|medley]]s of blues standards. Jazz poet and directorate of Newport [[Langston Hughes]] spontaneously wrote a finishing song, the slow "Goodbye Newport Blues", this time Spann as singer, as Waters was too exhausted to perform.{{sfn|Smith|2009|p=15<U+2013>17}}{{sfn|Gordon|2003|pp=197<U+2013>199}}

''At Newport 1960'' received positive critical reception. It was generally lauded for the powerful and fizzy performance by Waters and band. Cub Koda from [[Allmusic]] meant, Waters "lays it down tough and cool with a set that literally had [the audience] dancing in the aisles by the set close". Furthermore, he said the opening track, "I Got My Brand On You", "positively burns the relatively tame".<ref name="Allmusic"/> Matthew Oshinsky praised in ''1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die'' the "merciless refrain" in "Hoochie Goochie Man" and the "unvarnished moaning" in "Baby Please Don't Go". He also enjoyed Muddy's powerful [[baritone]], James Cotton's complaining harmonica play, Otis Spann's "pub piano"-like playing and the overall danceable music.{{sfn|Lydon|2005|p=53}} 

Chris Smith favoured in ''101 Albums That Changed Popular Music'' Waters' "growly vocal presentation, energetic stage presence, and electrifying (literally and figuratively) performances."{{sfn|Smith|2009|p=15-17}} The album was ranked at number 348 on ''Rolling Stones'' "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]" in 2003, where the band's playing was described as "tough, tight and in the groove" and James Cotton's harmonica jams as "a special treat."<ref name = "RS">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/at-newport-1960-muddy-waters-19691231|title=348) At Newport 1960|publisher=Wenner Media|work=Rolling Stone|date=November 2003|accessdate=January 11, 2011}}</ref> Critics called the album in ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]''{{'}}s "100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century" "immortal."{{sfn|Vibe|1999|p=100}} The album was mentioned in ''The Rough Guide to Blues 100 Essential CDs''.{{sfn|Ward|2000|p=177-178}}
