'''Mary of Guelders''' (c. 1434 &ndash; 1 December 1463)  was the [[Royal Consorts of Scotland|Queen Consort]] of Scotland as the wife of King [[James II of Scotland]]. She served as [[Regent]] of Scotland from 1460 to 1463.

==Biography==
===Background===
She was the daughter of [[Arnold, Duke of Guelders]], and [[Catherine of Cleves (1417-1479)|Catherine of Cleves]], a great-aunt of [[Anne of Cleves]]. She was a great-niece of [[Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy]].

===Burgundian court===

Philip and his wife [[Isabella of Portugal (1397<U+2013>1471)|Isabella of Portugal]] at first planned to have Mary betrothed to [[Charles, Count of Maine]], but her father could not pay the dowry.<ref>{{cite book | title=Scottish Queens, 1034-1714 | last=Marshall | first=Rosalind K. | pages=57<U+2013>58 | year=2003 | publisher=Tuckwell Press }}</ref> Mary stayed on at the Burgundian court, where Isabella frequently paid for her expenses. Mary attended Isabella's daughter-in-law [[Catherine of Valois, Countess of Charolais|Catherine of France]], while she herself was attended upon by ten people.<ref>{{cite book | last=Marshall | first=Rosalind K. | pages=57<U+2013>58 | year=2003 }}</ref> The duke and duchess then started negotiations for a Scottish marriage. Philip promised to pay her dowry, while Isabella paid for her trousseau. [[William Crichton]] came to the Burgundian court to escort her back to Scotland.<ref>{{cite book | last=Marshall | first=Rosalind K. | page=60 | year=2003 }}</ref>

===Marriage and children===
She landed in Scotland in June 1449 and both nobles and the common people came to see her as she made her way to [[Holyrood Abbey]]. Mary married [[James II of Scotland|James II]], [[King of Scots]], at Holyrood Abbey in [[Edinburgh]] on 3 July 1449. A sumptuous banquet was given, while the Scottish king gave her several presents. It had been agreed that any sons they might have would have no right to the duchy of [[Guelders]]. 

James and Mary had seven children together: 

*An unnamed son. {Both born and died on 19 May 1450).
*[[James III of Scotland]] (1451<U+2013>1488).
*[[Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany]] (c. 1454 - 1485).
*[[David Stewart, Earl of Moray]] (c. 1456 - 1457. He was created [[Earl of Moray]] on 12 February 1456.
*[[John Stewart, Earl of Mar (d. 1479)|John Stewart, 1st Earl of Mar and Garioch]] (c. 1459 - 1479).
*[[Princess Margaret of Scotland]]. Married William Crichton, 3rd Lord Crichton of Auchingoul. She became the mother of Margaret Crichton and mother-in-law of [[George Leslie, 4th Earl of Rothes]].
*[[Mary Stewart, Princess of Scotland|Princess Mary of Scotland]] (May 1453-May 1488). Married first [[Thomas Boyd, 1st Earl of Arran]] and secondly [[James Hamilton, 1st Lord Hamilton]]. She became the mother of [[James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Arran]].

===Regency===
After her husband's death, Mary acted as [[Regent]] for their son [[James III of Scotland]] until her own death three years later. Mary was drawn into the [[War of the Roses]] taking place in England at this time. She appointed Bishop Kennedy as her chief advisor; their companionship was described as well- functioning despite the fact that the bishop favored an alliance with the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrians]], while Mary at first wanted to continue playing off the warring parties in England against each other.<ref>{{cite book | last=Marshall | first=Rosalind K. | page=66 | year=2003 }}</ref> 

While Mary was still mourning the death of [[James II of Scotland|King James II]], the Lancastrian Queen [[Margaret of Anjou]] fled north across the border seeking refuge from the Yorkists. Mary sympathetically aided Margaret and took [[Edward of Westminster]] into her household to keep them out of Yorkist hands.

Mary's dealings with Margaret were mainly to provide aid to the deposed queen. Mary gave a number of Scottish troops to help Margaret and the Lancastrian cause. She and Margaret also organised a betrothal between [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales|Prince Edward]], son of King [[Henry VI of England]], and [[King James III]]'s sister Princess Margaret in 1461. In return for her support, Mary asked for the town of [[Berwick]] on the Anglo-Scottish border, which Margaret was willing to give up. 

Relations between the two women deteriorated, however, with the increasingly friendly alliance between [[King Edward IV]] of England and Duke Philip of Burgundy. Any support by Mary for Margaret, Edward's enemy, threatened the alliance that Duke Philip wanted with King Edward IV against the French [[King Louis XI]].

Edward IV tried to put a stop to Mary's support of Margaret by proposing marriage to the widowed queen, which Mary rejected. Her uncle, Duke Philip, pressured her to call off the betrothal of Margaret of Scotland and Prince Edward, to Margaret's disappointment. In 1462, she paid the Lancastrian royals to leave Scotland and made peace with Edward IV. She also hinted at the possibility of a marriage between herself and the new English king. Mary, reportedly, had several affairs during her period as regent, notably one with the Lord Hailes<ref>[http://books.google.se/books?id=KfGZM8RXSJwC&pg=PA432&dq=Margaret+of+England+queen+of+scotland+1275&hl=sv&ei=y3oOTvKDDoTEsga-s8yDDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&q=scotland&f=false Anne Echols, Marty Williams: An annotated index of medieval women ]</ref>

Mary went ahead with James II's plan to build a castle on land at [[Ravenscraig Castle|Ravenscraig]], designed to withstand the use of artillery, and lived in it while it was under construction until her death.<ref>{{cite book | last=Marshall | first=Rosalind K. | page=67 | year=2003 }}</ref>

===Trinity College Church===
A devout [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], Mary founded [[Trinity College Kirk|Trinity College Church]] ca. 1460 in memory of her husband.  The church, located in the area now known as Edinburgh's [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]], was demolished in 1848 to make way for [[Waverley station]], although it was partially reconstructed on a different site in 1870 under the name Trinity Apse.  Mary was buried in the church, although her coffin was moved to [[Holyrood Abbey]] in 1848.
