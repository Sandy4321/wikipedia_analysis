==Biography==
Lerner was born on April 7, 1919 in Cleveland, the youngest of three children. Their father Abraham had died on November 11, 1918 before Al's birth, a victim of the [[1918 flu pandemic]]. Lerner's mother Jennie Takiff then married a sheet metal worker named Abe Lerner, who became Al's adopted father. During the [[Prohibition in the United States|American Prohibition]] banning the sale of alcohol, Abe Lerner used his metalworking abilities on the side to make [[still]]s for [[American gangsters during the 1920s|Cleveland gangsters]] and [[bootlegging (business)|bootleggers]], and used his seven-year-old son Al as a courier for payments. It was a rough neighborhood with regular mob wars between rival gangsters, multiple killings on Lerner's street, and payoffs to the local police. Abe Lerner was eventually arrested and the still business was shut down, after which the family went broke.<ref name=bio/>  

As a child, Lerner helped to bring in money by climbing onto tables in local saloons and singing songs such as "All Alone by the Telephone", and then collecting coins thrown by the patrons. He then took piano lessons at a convent next to [[List of hospitals in Ohio|St. Anne's Hospital]], but quit because he thought it was too difficult. When he saw a performance by [[Bill Robinson]] at [[The Palace]], he decided he wanted to learn [[tap dancing]], so studied with [[Roy Lewis]], and soon was winning amateur contests. He was also learning how to play drums from his brother Harold, and began playing for $1.50/night at a local brothel. As he tired of carrying the drums back and forth though, he decided to switch back to piano as it was easier, and resumed his lessons. His skills continued to improve, and by the age of 17 he had worked his way up to earning $15/week, playing at clubs such as Shadowland, and developing an affinity for [[jazz]] by listening to records by [[Earl Hines]].<ref name=bio/>   He attended [[John Adams High School (Cleveland, Ohio)|John Adams High School]] and [[Glenville High School]].

Lerner was introduced to jazz pianist [[Art Tatum]] at a Cleveland Club, and was "blown away" by the man's skill as a jazz player.<ref name=bio>Lerner, Al. ''Vamp Til Ready'', 2007, ISBN 978-1-59393-080-6</ref> Lerner then traveled in search of work, going to [[Miami Beach]] but the job fell through, so he then went to [[Havana]], Cuba, aboard ''[[The Cuba]]''. When he returned to the United States, he got a call from [[Harry James]], who invited Lerner to join his band in New York. There, Lerner discovered that James wanted to have an unheard-of two pianos in his band, with Lerner playing one, and [[Jack Gardner (musician)|Jack Gardner]] the other. With a steady job, Lerner proposed to his Cleveland girlfriend, Ruth Levkovitz, and they married on June 15, 1941 and settled in New York, though Lerner spent much of his time on the road with the band, doing 50 and 60 one-night-stands at a time.

In 1941, when [[Ray Bolger]] (later the Scarecrow in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'') was a featured act with the James band at the [[Paramount Theatre (New York City)|Paramount Theatre]] in New York, Lerner and Bolger would do a "challenge" tap dance as part of the show.<ref name=bio/> When [[Glenn Miller]] enlisted in the Army, his band was not able to perform on the ''[[Chesterfield Hour]]'' radio program, after which the Harry James Band was chosen. This meant a major increase in salary for Lerner, up to $75/week. With the exposure on the radio show, the band also began getting work in the film industry, such as in ''[[Private Buckaroo]]'' and ''[[Springtime in the Rockies]]''. The band got more attention, and was regularly on the move, from New York to Los Angeles and back again. It was during this time that Lerner began composing, such as writing an instrumental with Harry James, "[[Music Makers]]", which became the band's theme. When the James Band finally broke up in 1944, Lerner stayed in Los Angeles and joined with singer [[Dick Haymes]], with whom he worked for the next thirteen years as musical director.

Over the course of his career, Lerner worked with many artists from the [[Big Band]] era of music, such as [[Charlie Barnet]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Glenn Miller]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Kay Starr]], and [[Pat Boone]]. He played with the [[Harry James]] band at the Paramount Theater in 1940, featuring [[Bea Wain]], has performed at [[Carnegie Hall]], and was conductor at a [[Royal Command Performance]] for [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] in 1954 at the [[London Palladium]], in a benefit for the [[Variety Artistes Benevolent Fund]]. Lyricists that he has worked with include [[Frankie Laine]]. In 1961, he composed the music for "So Until I See You", with lyrics by Victor Gari Corpora. The music was used as the closing theme of the Jack Paar Show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicthemes.com/50sTVThemes/themePages/tonight_Paar.html|title=Tonight: The Jack Paar Tonight Show|accessdate=July 18, 2011|publisher=classicthemes.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110623073859/http://classicthemes.com/50sTVThemes/themePages/tonight_Paar.html| archivedate= June 23, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bearmanormedia.bizland.com/id135.html|publisher=Bear Manor Media|accessdate=July 18, 2011|title=Al Lerner|year=2007}}</ref>

Lerner's first wife, Ruth Levkovitz Lerner, died in 1987.  In 1991 he remarried, and as of 2011, Lerner is living in [[Palm Desert, California]] with his wife, Jonne.  He has two children by his first marriage.
