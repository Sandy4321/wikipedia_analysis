'''M-53''' is a gateway route to [[The Thumb]] region of the US state of [[Michigan]], carrying vacationers to the many cottages and resorts located on [[Saginaw Bay]] and [[Lake Huron]] in the vicinity of [[Caseville, Michigan|Caseville]] and [[Port Austin, Michigan|Port Austin]]. This highway is also used to transport agricultural and manufactured products from [[the Thumb]] region to the [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] Metropolitan area. In [[Macomb County, Michigan|Macomb County]], M-53 is also a major north&ndash;south commuter route.

==Route description==
The '''Van Dyke Freeway''', is an {{convert|8.75|mi|km|adj=on}} segment of M-53 that is a controlled-access [[freeway]], unconnected to any other freeways in the state.

This portion of the M-53 freeway was constructed in the 1960s and was envisioned as part of a much larger project to connect the freeways within the city of [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] with a proposed [[M-21 (Michigan highway)|M-21]] (now [[Interstate 69|I-69]] freeway near [[Imlay City, Michigan|Imlay City]]. Only the portion from 18-1/2 Mile Road in [[Sterling Heights, Michigan|Sterling Heights]] northerly to north of 27 Mile Road near Washington was built, although a massive freeway-to-freeway interchange was completed along [[Interstate 696|I-696]] in [[Warren, Michigan|Warren]] in the early 1970s.

As of 2004, the [[Romeo, Michigan|Romeo]] bypass (continuing on north of the freeway) was upgraded to a limited-access, divided expressway (no private access, but without grade-separated interchanges) and long-range plans are to convert this segment to fully controlled-access freeway in the future.

The M-53 freeway in Macomb County is officially named the Christopher Columbus Freeway and signs are posted with this name at many of the interchanges. Radio [[traffic report]]s have been known to use the official name, the colloquial "Van Dyke Freeway" as well as "M-53 Freeway" interchangeably over the years.

Most of the M-53 roadway that runs through the gently rolling agricultural countryside of its northern stretches consists of two lanes, one in each direction. A six mile (10&nbsp;km) long portion through the orchards near [[Romeo, Michigan|Romeo]] has been constructed as a limited access highway and is being improved with grade separations.  South of Romeo, M-53 becomes a rural controlled access freeway, with two lanes in each direction over a nine mile (14&nbsp;km) length.  This is followed by three miles of a six lane boulevard configuration through the outer ring suburb of [[Sterling Heights, Michigan|Sterling Heights]], while the remainder of the roadway through [[Warren, Michigan|Warren]] and [[Center Line, Michigan|Center Line]] six traffic lanes with a center turn lane. It is four traffic lanes in Detroit.

M-53 is serviced by [[Interstate 69]] Exit 168, south of [[Imlay City, Michigan|Imlay City]] and by [[Interstate 696]] Exit 23 on the Warren/Center Line border at Eleven Mile Road.  M-53 also intersects with [[M-142 (Michigan highway)|M-142]] in [[Bad Axe, Michigan|Bad Axe]], [[M-81 (Michigan highway)|M-81]] near [[Cass City, Michigan|Cass City]], [[M-46 (Michigan highway)|M-46]] north of [[Marlette, Michigan|Marlette]], [[M-59 (Michigan highway)|M-59]] in [[Utica, Michigan|Utica]], and [[M-102 (Michigan highway)|M-102]] ([[Eight Mile Road]]) on the Warren/Detroit border.  M-53 has a 4-lane setup in the countryside several miles south of Marlette and most of it consists of a concurrency of [[M-90 (Michigan highway)|M-90]].

===Maintenance issues===
When the "Freeway" Portion of Van Dyke ends just south of M-59, it becomes a 6 lane road with 3 lanes each way. It is here that funding changes hands, and the condition of the road deteriorates quite severely. Due to the large amount of heavy trucks driving down this road, the road becomes beaten and battered. In addition, Michigan weather takes its toll. Every year, much of the road needs to be rebuilt. However work has slowed quite considerably in the recent year. Many MI residents call for work to resume.<ref>[http://drivemi.com/usercomments.php drive michigan | the campaign to improve michigan's roads<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Businesses have blamed lost business on customer's lack of desire to use the road. Macomb County has, due to the pressure from taxpayers, agreed to a $700,000 resurfacing effort that will tide the road over until 2011 for a total reconstruction.<ref>[http://www.macombdaily.com/stories/070108/loc_local03.shtml Macomb Daily : Van Dyke set for repaving 07/01/08<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Alternate names===
The freeway portion of M-53 is officially known as the [[Christopher Columbus]] Freeway (a nod to Macomb County's large [[Italian American]] population), but it is more commonly called either the [[Van Dyke Expressway]], Van Dyke Freeway or M-53 Freeway.  The remaining southerly portion carries the name Van Dyke Avenue and is also known as the Earle Memorial Highway, in honor of [[Horatio Earle]], Michigan's first Highway Commissioner.  Beyond the southern terminus of M-53, the roadway continues on as a residential street known as Van Dyke Street until it ends at Jefferson Avenue near the [[Detroit River]]. Outside of Detroit, along most of the non-freeway stretches of M-53, the road is commonly known as Van Dyke Road.
