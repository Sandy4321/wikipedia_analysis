A '''forced conversion''' is the [[religious conversion]] or acceptance of a philosophy against the will of the subject, often with the threatened consequence of earthly penalties or harm. These consequences range from [[job loss]] and [[social isolation]] to incarceration, torture or death. It is a form of [[religious cleansing]].

===End of Roman empire===
Forced conversion was a major way for the [[Christianization]] of the [[Roman Empire]]. In 392 Emperor [[Theodosius I]] decreed that Christianity was the only legal religion of the Roman Empire, and forbidding pagan practices by law:
<blockquote>
It is Our will that all the peoples who are ruled by the administration of Our Clemency shall practice that religion which the divine Peter the Apostle transmitted to the Romans....The rest, whom We adjudge demented and insane, shall sustain the infamy of heretical dogmas, their meeting places shall not receive the name of churches, and they shall be smitten first by divine vengeance and secondly by the retribution of Our own initiative''" ([[Codex Theodosianus]] XVI 1.2.).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/greece/paganism/paganism.html |title=Paganism and Rome |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref>
</blockquote>

===Medieval era===
During the [[Saxon Wars]], [[Charlemagne]], [[King of the Franks]], forcibly Roman Catholicized the [[Saxons]] from their native [[Germanic paganism]] by way of warfare and law upon conquest. Examples include the [[Massacre of Verden]] in 782, during which Charlemagne reportedly had 4,500 captive Saxons massacred upon rebelling against conversion, and the ''[[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae]]'', a law imposed on conquered Saxons in 785 which prescribes death to those that refuse to convert to Christianity.<ref name="CHARLEMAGNE">For the Massacre of Verden, see Barbero, Alessandro (2004). ''Charlemagne: Father of a Continent'', page 46. [[University of California Press]]. For the ''Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae'', see Rich<U+00E9>, Pierre (1993). ''The Carolingians''. [[University of Pennsylvania Press]]. ISBN 978-0-8122-1342-3.</ref>

[[Pope Innocent III]] pronounced in 1201 that even if torture and intimidation had been employed in receiving the sacrament, one nevertheless:
<blockquote>...does receive the impress of Christianity and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling. ... [For] the grace of Baptism had been received, and they had been [[confirmation (sacrament)|anointed with the sacred oil]], and had [[eucharist|participated in the body of the Lord]], they might properly be forced to hold to the faith which they had accepted perforce, lest the name of the Lord be blasphemed, and lest they hold in contempt and consider vile the faith they had joined.<ref>Grayzel, Solomon, ''The Church and the Jews in the Thirteenth Century'', rev. ed., New York: Hermon, 1966, p. 103</ref></blockquote>

From ''The Crusades'', by Bernard Hamilton<ref>''The Crusades'', by Bernard Hamilton, 1998, Sutton Publishing, United Kingdom, Chapter 9: Later Crusades, p. 87.</ref>   <U+201C>In 1309 the [[Teutonic Order]] moved its headquarters to Marienburg in Prussia.  It had a papal license to wage perpetual war against the pagans and used this to launch annual crusades against [[Lithuania]].  These expeditions were very popular with the nobility of northern Europe: campaigns were held twice a year, in the summer and in the winter when the order laid on special Christmas festivities for visiting crusaders.<U+201D> <U+201C>The excuse for men who enjoyed fighting and to lay waste large parts of Lithuania in the name of Christ was removed in 1386 when the [[King of Lithuania]], [[Jagiello]], married [[Queen Jadwiga of Poland]] and received Catholic baptism.  The two kingdoms were united under Christian rulers and the Teutonic Knights no longer had any justification for crusading against pagans there.<U+201D>

===Spanish Inquisition===
After the end of the [[Al-Andalus|Islamic control of Spain]], Muslims and Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492 and from Portugal in 1497.<ref>[http://www.home.earthlink.net/~benven/annivers.html 500 ANNIVERSARY OF THE FORCED CONVERSION OF THE JEWS OF PORTUGAL<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> After the [[Reconquista]], so called "[[New Christian]]s" were those inhabitants ([[Sephardi]]c Jews or [[Mud<U+00E9>jar]] Muslims) during the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Era who were baptized under coercion and in the face of murder, becoming forced converts from Islam ([[Morisco]]s, [[Converso]]s and ''secret Moors'') and forced converts from [[Judaism]] ([[Converso]]s, [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto-Jews]] and [[Marrano]]s). 
Then the [[Spanish Inquisition]] targeted primarily forced converts from Judaism who came under suspicion of either continuing to adhere to their old religion or of having fallen back into it. Jewish conversos still resided in Spain and often hiddenly (cryptically) practiced Judaism and were suspected by the "Old Christians" of being [[Crypto-Jew]]s. The Spanish Inquisition generated much wealth and income for the church and individual inquisitors by confiscating the property of the persecutees or selling them into slavery. The end of the [[Al-Andalus]] and the expulsion of the Sephardic Jews from the Iberian Peninsula went hand in hand with the increase of Spanish-Portugal influence in the world, as exemplified in the Christian conquest of the Americas and their aboriginal Indian population. The Ottoman empire, the Netherlands, and the New World absorbed much of the Jewish refugees.<ref>[http://www.thejerusalemconnection.us/news-archive/tag/inquisition 3000 Years of Sephardic History] Jerusalem Connection Writers Archives</ref>

===Goa Inquisition===
Religious persecution took place by the Portuguese in [[Goa]], India from 16th to the 17th century. The natives of Goa, most of them Hindus were subjected to [[Goa Inquisition|severe torture and oppression]] by the zealous Portuguese rulers and missionaries and forcibly converted to Christianity.<ref>[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RS1uAAAAMAAJ Of umbrellas, goddesses, and dreams: essays on Goan culture and society] Robert Samuel Newman, 2001</ref><ref>[[The Goa Inquisition (book)|The Goa Inquisition, Being a Quatercentenary Commemoration Study of the Inquisition in India]] by Anant Priolkar, Bombay University Press</ref><ref>[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=hSnn_kDUI6AC&pg=PA69 Everyday Nationalism: Women of the Hindu Right in India] Kalyani Devaki Menon, 2009</ref><ref>[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ftS1AAAAIAAJ Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bombay] 1967</ref><ref>M.

In 1567, the campaign of destroying temples in Bardez met with success. At the end of it 300 Hindu temples were destroyed. Enacting laws, prohibition was laid from December 4, 1567 on rituals of Hindu marriages, sacred thread wearing and cremation. All the persons above 15 years of age were compelled to listen to Christian preaching, failing which they were punished. In 1583, Hindu temples at Assolna and Cuncolim were destroyed through army action. "The fathers of the Church forbade the Hindus under terrible penalties the use of their own sacred books, and prevented them from all exercise of their religion. They destroyed their temples, and so harassed and interfered with the people that they abandoned the city in large numbers, refusing to remain any longer in a place where they had no liberty, and were liable to imprisonment, torture and death if they worshipped after their own fashion the gods of their fathers." wrote Filippo Sassetti, who was in India from 1578 to 1588. An order was issued in June 1684 for suppressing the Konkani language and making it compulsory to speak the Portuguese language. The law provided for dealing toughly with anyone using the local language. Following that law all the non-Christian cultural symbols and the books written in local languages were sought to be destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/28411503/Goa-Inquisition-for-Colonial-Disciplining |title=Goa Inquisition for Colonial Disciplining |publisher=Scribd.com |date=2010-03-15 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref>

Methods such as repressive laws, demolition of temples and mosques, destruction of holy books, fines and the forcible conversion of orphans were used.<ref>Mascarenhas-Keyes, Stella (1979), Goans in London: portrait of a Catholic Asian community, Goan Association (U.K.)</ref>

===Native American boarding schools===
The government paid religious societies to provide education to Native American children on reservations. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) founded additional [[American Indian boarding schools]] based on the assimilation model of the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]].
 
Children were usually immersed in European-American culture through appearance changes with haircuts, were forbidden to speak their native languages, and traditional names were replaced by new European-American names. The experience of the schools was often harsh, especially for the younger children who were separated from their families. In numerous ways, they were encouraged or forced to abandon their Native American identities and cultures.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20050829051045/http://sacbee.com/static/archive/news/projects/native/day2_main.html "Long-suffering urban Indians find roots in ancient rituals". California's Lost Tribes] Archived from the original on August 29, 2005. Retrieved February 8, 2006.</ref> The number of Native American children in the boarding schools reached a peak in the 1970s, with an estimated enrollment of 60,000 in 1973. Especially through investigations of the later twentieth century, there have been many documented cases of sexual, physical and mental abuse occurring at such schools.<ref>"Developmental and learning disabilities". PRSP Disabilities. Retrieved February 8, 2006.</ref><ref>http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/newsletter"Soul Wound: The Legacy of Native American Schools". Amnesty International USA. Retrieved February 8, 2006.</ref> Since those years, tribal nations have increasingly insisted on community-based schools and have also founded numerous tribally controlled colleges. Community schools have also been supported by the federal government through the BIA and legislation. The largest boarding schools have closed. In some cases, reservations or tribes were too small or poor to support independent schools and still wanted an alternative for their children, especially for high school. By 2007, the number of Native American children in boarding schools had declined to 9,500.

==Judaism==

Forced conversions are occured under the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean Empire]]. The Idumaens were forced to convert to Judaism, either by threats of exile, or threats of death, depending on the source.<ref>Flavius Josephus Antiquities 13.257<U+2013>258</ref><ref>[[Aristobulus I|Aristobulus]]</ref> 
In ''Euseb<U+00ED>us, Christianity, and Judaism''  Harold W. Attridge  claims that <U+201C>there is reason to think that Josephus<U+2019> account of their conversion is substantially accurate.<U+201D>  He also writes, <U+201C>That these were not isolated instances but that forced conversion was a national policy is clear from the fact that Alexander Jannaeus (ca 80 BCE) demolished the city of Pella in Moab, <U+2018>because the inhabitants would not agree to adopt the national custom of the Jews.<U+2019><U+201D>  Josephus, Antiquities. 13.15.4, 397<ref>{{citation |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jVyzbHAJ_hAC&pg=PA374&dq=Ituraeans+forced+conversion&hl=en&ei=dNUATu3BAciv8QORmPTHDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC4Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=Ituraeans%20forced%20conversion&f=false |accessdate=2011-06-20}}</ref>

Maurice Sartre has written of the "policy of forced Judaization adopted by [[John Hyrcanus|Hyrcanos]], [[Aristobulus I]] and [[Jannaeus]]<U+201D>, who offered "the conquered peoples a choice between expulsion or conversion,<U+201D><ref>{{citation |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9y7nTpFcN3AC&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=Ituraeans+forced+conversion&source=bl&ots=hxTELYx1Vd&sig=_EhvKuhvcja0F7ZTkGcW6ET6nG8&ei=lMwATsfQOcmn8QO41syeDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Ituraeans%20forced%20conversion&f=false |accessdate=2011-06-20}}</ref>

And in ''The early Roman period'', Volume 2, William David Davies has written that <U+201C>The evidence is best explained by postulating that an existing small Jewish population in Lower Galilee was massively expanded by the forced conversion in c.104 BCE of their Gentile neighbours in the north.<U+201D><ref>{{citation |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MA-4VX5gWS4C&pg=PA599&dq=Ituraeans+forced+conversion&ei=f9MATobdEMiW8QPYpqyTDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Ituraeans%20forced%20conversion&f=false |accessdate=2011-06-20}}</ref>

===Theology===
Many scholars have argued that early Islamic scripture and law forbids forced conversion,<ref name="W53">Waines (2003) "An Introduction to Islam" ''Cambridge University Press''. p. 53</ref>

One particular  verse of the [[Qur'an]] ({{cite quran|2|256|expand=no|style=nosup}}) is frequently cited, reading "let there be no compulsion in religion".<ref>Sir Thomas W.

Other scholars{{who|date=March 2014}} point to sunnah, described in multiple [[Hadith]], which suggest [[Muhammad as a general|use of violence by Muhammed and his followers]] to achieve forced religious conversion.{{cn|date=March 2014}} [[Sahih al-Bukhari]], for example, describes Muhammed asking his followers,

{{quotation|Narrated Ibn 'Umar: Allah's Apostle said: "I have been ordered (by Allah) to fight against the people until they testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is Allah's Apostle, and offer the prayers perfectly and give the obligatory charity, so if they perform that, then they save their lives and property from me except for Islamic laws and then their reckoning (accounts) will be done by Allah."|{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|1|2|25}} see also {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|5|59|643}}<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/002-sbt.php#001.002.025 University of Southern California translation of the hadith, Sahih al-Bukhari, Book 2]</ref><ref>Khan, M.

The [[Arabs]] came to conquer [[Sindh]] under command of [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] in 711 CE.

There is dispute amongst scholars as to whether the famous Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] converted to Islam in order to freely escape from Almohad territory, and then reconverted back to Judaism in either the Levant or in Egypt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/the-great-rambam-joel-kramers-maimonides/86437/ |title=The Great Rambam: Joel Kraemer's 'Maimonides' <U+2013> The New York Sun |publisher=Nysun.com |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref> Maimonides wrote a book on [[apostasy]] wherein he advocated accepting forced conversion rather than suffer martydom, and to then seek refuge afterward at a place where it was safe. The dispute also extended to the allegedly forced conversion of [[Sabbatai Zevi]], an Ottoman Jew from Smyrna. In reality, at the beginning of 1666, the [[Ottoman Sultan]] in [[Constantinople]] ordered Sabbatai, who had many followers and had claimed to be the long-awaited [[Jewish messiah]], to be imprisoned. When Sabbatai was later taken to Adrianople, the Sultan's physician, a former Jew, advised him to convert to Islam. The following day he converted before the Sultan, who happily rewarded Sabbatai by conferring the title (Mahmed) ''Effendi'', and appointing him as his doorkeeper with a high salary. A number of Sabbatai's followers also went over to Islam and about 300 families converted and were known as d<U+00F6>nmeh (converts).<ref name="tnr.com">[http://www.tnr.com/book/review/the-other-secret-jews?utm_source=TNR+Books+%26+Arts&utm_campaign=4866964be0-TNR_BA_021810&utm_medium=email Adam Kirsch, "The Other Secret Jews", review of Marc David Baer, ''The D<U+00F6>nme: Jewish Converts, Muslim Revolutionaries, and Secular Turks''], ''The New Republic'', Feb 15, 2010, accessed Feb 20, 2010</ref>

Indian Christians have alleged that "radical Hindu groups" in [[Orissa]], India have forced Christian converts from Hinduism to "revert"<ref name="revert">the word ''revert'' is used in this context; not ''convert''; see [http://www.jstor.org/stable/4413900 Older than the Church: Christianity and Caste in The God of Small Things India] by A Sekhar;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/mar/11/proselytism-on-the-table Washington post article]</ref> to Hinduism. These "religious riots" were largely between two tribal groups in [[Orissa]], one of which was predominantly Hindu and another predominantly Christian, over the [[Murder of Swami Lakshmanananda|assassination]] of a Hindu leader named [[Swami Lakshmanananda]] by Christian [[Maoists]] operating as terrorist groups in India (see [[Naxalite]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindujagruti.org/news/5576.html |title=We killed Swami Laxmananda: Christian Maoist leader <U+2013> Attack |publisher=hindujagruti.org |date=2008-10-06 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref> In the aftermath of the violence, American Christian evangelical groups have claimed that Hindu groups are "forcibly reverting" Christians converts from Hinduism back to Hinduism.<ref name="revert" /> However, some local Christian groups have dismissed these allegations and forced conversion is not what Jesus Christ preached.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.rediff.com/report/2009/aug/14/orissa-christian-leaders-disagree-with-us-report.htm|title= Orissa: Christian leaders disagree with US panel's report|date= 2009-08-14|publisher=Rediff News}}</ref>

United Nations Refugee Agency and other global human rights groups have published several reports describing forced conversion to Islam in nations with majority Islamic and regionally large Islamic populations.<ref>[http://www.refworld.org/docid/510f8b832.html Pakistan - Religious conversions, UNHCR January 2013 report]</ref><ref>[http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/indonesia0213_ForUpload_0.pdf In Religion's Name: Abuses against Religious Minorities in Indonesia]</ref><ref>[http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2012&dlid=208232 Religious Freedom Report for 2012 - Indonesia]</ref> Some examples are described below.

In 2012, over 1000 Catholic children in East Timor, removed from their families, were reported to being held in Indonesia without consent of their parents, forcibly converted to Islam, educated in Islamic schools and naturalized.<ref>[http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/world-news/detail/articolo/indonesia-12401/ Indonesia: thousands of Catholic children kidnapped and forced to convert to Islam, Vatican (Rome)]</ref> Other reports claim forced conversion of minority [[Ahmadiyya]] sect Muslims to Sunni Islam, with the use of violence.<ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/11/06/sampang-shiites-forced-convert-sunni-kontras.html Sampang Shiites forced to convert to Sunni, November 2012, The Jakarta Post]</ref><ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/07/indonesia-inquiry-ahmadiyah-muslims-killed Indonesian president condemns mob killing of Ahmadiyah Muslims, The Guardian, London, February 2011]</ref><ref>[http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/files/dmfile/crouch_final_website1.pdf Indonesia, Militant Islam and Ahmadiya, Melissa Crouch (2010), University of Melbourne, Australia]</ref>

In 2001 the [[Indonesia]]n army evacuated hundreds of Christian refugees from the remote [[Kesui]] and [[Teor]] islands in [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]] after the refugees stated that they had been forced to convert to Islam. According to reports, some of the men had been circumcised against their will, and a paramilitary group involved in the incident confirmed that circumcisions had taken place while denying any element of coercion.<ref>Maluku refugees allege forced circumcision, BBC News Online, Wednesday, January 31, 2001 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1146224.stm]</ref>

====Middle-East====
In 2013, [[Inter Press Service]] reported more than 500 Christian girls have been abducted in [[Egypt]], over the last two years, with a growing number of cases involving girls between the ages of 13 and 17.<ref>[http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/04/missing-christian-girls-leave-trail-of-tears/ Missing Christian girls leave a trail of tears], Cam McGrath, Inter Press Agency (April 16, 2013)</ref> In 2012, a 14-year old Coptic Christian girl was kidnapped, forcibly converted to Islam and married in [[Al Dab'a]], Egypt, though Egyptian laws criminalize child marriage and prohibit the conversion of minors.<ref>[http://www.refworld.org/docid/519dd4ca61.html United Nations Refugee Agency, 2012 Report on International Religious Freedom - Egypt]</ref>

In 2004 [[Coptic Christian]]s in Egypt occupied the main Coptic cathedral in [[Cairo]] for several days, angry at the disappearance of a priest's wife in a village in the [[Nile delta]], who, they alleged, had been forced to convert to Islam. The [[BBC]] reported that allegations of forced conversions of Copts to Islam surface every year in Egypt.<ref>Heba Saleh (BBC News, Cairo), [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4080777.stm 'Conversion' sparks Copt protest].

In several Middle East countries, force of law has been used to prevent and punish [[apostasy]] and religious conversions. For example, in 2008, sharia courts of [[Jordan]] have used Islamic law to judge religious conversion. People who convert from Islam to other religions lose their civil and property rights, their marriages are annulled, and their Muslims relatives gain custody of their children.<ref>[http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/JO/ECLJ_JOR_UPR_S4_2009_EuropeanCentreforLawandJustice_upr.pdf United Nations Office of Human Rights Commission, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN (2008)]</ref> In [[Saudi Arabia]], on December 17, 2012, the Jeddah District Court, hearing charges against [[Raif Badawi]] for the crime of apostasy (leaving Islamic faith), demanded that the defendant "repent to God" in the court. Badawi refused. The judge then referred the sentence of death penalty to a higher court.<ref>[http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/12/22/saudi-arabia-website-editor-facing-death-penalty Saudi Arabia, Website editor faces death penalty (2012)]</ref>

====India====
In Jammu & Kashmir, the [[Ladakh Buddhist Association]] has said: "There is a deliberate and organised design to convert Kargil's Buddhists to Islam.  In the last four years, about 50 girls and married women with children were taken and converted from village Wakha alone.  If this continues unchecked, we fear that Buddhists will be wiped out from Kargil in the next two decades or so.

In 2003 a six year old Sikh girl was kidnapped by a member of the [[Afridi]] tribe in Northwest Frontier Province; he also claimed the girl had converted to Islam and therefore could not be returned to her family.<ref>{{cite book|title=Annual Report on International Religious Freedom|year=2005|publisher=State Dept (US), Senate (US) Committee on Foreign Relations|page=667|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=04dlwzB2SvcC&pg=PA667}}</ref>

The United Nations Refugee Agency reported in 2013 that at least 700 Christian girls in Pakistan are kidnapped and forced to convert to Islam every year. Additionally, the report claims 15 to 20 Hindu kidnapping cases are reported each month to the Hindu Council in Karachi alone, widespread complaints of forced conversions and forced child marriages of Hindu girls to Muslim men in Sindh province of Pakistan. The Human Rights Council of Pakistan has reported that cases of forced conversion are increasing.<ref>[http://www.refworld.org/docid/51826ef842.html  USCIRF Annual Report 2013 - Countries of Particular Concern: Pakistan]</ref><ref>[http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca:8080/RIR_RDI/RIR_RDI.aspx?id=454343&l=e Government Research Directorate, Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, Pakistan: Religious conversion, including treatment of converts and forced conversions (2009-2012)]</ref>

====United Kingdom====
According to the [[Daily Mail]], in 2007, commissioner of police Sir [[Ian Blair]] stated the police were targeting extremist members of the Muslim community who were allegedly forcing vulnerable girls to convert to Islam in response to claims made by the Hindu Forum.<ref>{{cite web|title=Police protect girls forced to convert to Islam |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-437871/Police-protect-girls-forced-convert-Islam.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=19 August 2013|date=22 February 2007}}</ref> In 2007 a Sikh girl's family claimed that she had been forcibly converted to Islam, and they received a police guard after being attacked by an armed gang, although the "Police said no one was injured in the incident".<ref>{{cite web|last=Cowan|first=Mark|title=Police guard girl 'forced to become Muslim' |url=http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/mail/news/tm_headline=police-guard-girl--forced-to-become-muslim-%26method=full%26objectid=19253457%26siteid=50002-name_page.html|publisher=Birmingham Mail|accessdate=19 August 2013|date=Jun 6, 2007}}</ref>

In response to these news stories, an open letter to Sir Ian Blair, signed by ten Hindu academics, argued that claims that Hindu and Sikh girls were being forcefully converted were "part of an arsenal of myths propagated by right-wing Hindu supremacist organisations in India".<ref>http://www.pickledpolitics.com/archives/1045</ref> The [[Muslim Council of Britain]] issued a press release pointing out there is a lack of evidence of any forced conversions and suggested it is an underhand attempt to smear the British Muslim population.<ref>http://www.mcb.org.uk/media/presstext.php?ann_id=242</ref> Sheikh Musa Admani, an imam, said Islamic extremist groups may be evading university bans on groups such as [[Hizb ut Tahrir]] and [[Al-Muhajiroun]].<ref>{{cite web|title=<U+2018>Hindu girls targeted by extremists<U+2019>|url=http://metro.co.uk/2007/02/22/hindu-girls-targeted-by-extremists-108990/|publisher=http://metro.co.uk|date=22 Feb 2007}}</ref>

An academic paper by Katy Sian published in the journal ''South Asian Popular Culture'' in 2011 explored the question of how "'forced' conversion narratives" arose around the [[Sikhism in the United Kingdom|Sikh diaspora in the United Kingdom]].<ref name=Forced>{{cite journal | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14746681003798060 | title = <U+2018>Forced<U+2019> conversions in the British Sikh diaspora | first = Katy P. |last = Sian |date = 6 July 2011 | journal = South Asian Popular Culture}}</ref> Sian, who reports that claims of conversion through courtship on campuses are widespread in the UK, indicates that rather than relying on actual evidence they primarily rest on the word of "a friend of a friend" or on personal [[anecdote]]. According to Sian, the narrative is similar to accusations of "[[white slavery]]" lodged against the Jewish community and foreigners to the UK and the US, with the former having ties to [[anti-semitism]] that mirror the [[Islamophobia]] betrayed by the modern narrative. Sian expanded on these views in 2013's ''Mistaken Identities, Forced Conversions, and Postcolonial Formations''.<ref name="Sian2013">{{cite book|author=Katy P.
