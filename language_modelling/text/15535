}}'''Ferdinand Keller''' (1800 &ndash; 1881) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[archaeologist]]. He is mainly known for his investigations of Swiss [[Stilt house|lake dwellings]] in 1853<U+2013>54,<ref>{{Cite Nuttall|Keller, Ferdinand|first_letter=K}}</ref> and work on the remains of the [[La T<U+00E8>ne culture]]. He is the founder of the [[Antiquarische Gesellschaft in Z<U+00FC>rich]].

==Biography==
He was born at [[Marthalen]]. He studied theology and natural sciences at Zurich, Lausanne, and Paris. In 1831 he was made an instructor at Zurich, and secretary of the Society for Natural Research, and in this capacity he published various works on naked rock soil and vent holes. The discovery of the sepulchral mound at [[Burgh<U+00F6>lzli]] led to the founding of an antiquarian society of which Keller was long president, and of a museum, the growth of which was largely due to him. His most important discovery was the pile dwelling at [[Meilen|Obermeilen]] in the winter of 1853.
