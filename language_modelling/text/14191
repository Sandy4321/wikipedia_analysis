'''Brian P. Tierney''' (born 1957){{Ref label|start|a|none}} is an [[United States|American]] a former advertising and public relations executive and publisher of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''.<ref name="media">{{cite journal | first=Joseph N. | last=DiStefano | coauthors=Larry Eichel | date=May 29, 2006 | title=How a long shot won the bidding for The Inquirer |url=http://www.mywire.com/a/PhiladelphiaInquirer/long-shot-won-bidding-Inquirer/1601902?extID=10051 | journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer | accessdate=2008-10-17 }}</ref> Born in [[Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania]], Tierney created Tierney Communications, one of the largest and most successful [[public relations]] and advertising firms in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. In the local media Tierney became known for personally contacting reporters and their editors with accusations of bias and unprofessionalism whenever a negative story about his clients appeared. Five years after True North Communications acquired Tierney Communications in 1998, Tierney left and founded another public relations firm, which was a sold a few months later. 

Tierney in 2006 assembled a group of investors to form [[Philadelphia Media Holdings]] LLC, a group started with the purpose of buying ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' and ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]''. Chief executive of Philadelphia Media Holdings, Tierney also became the publisher of the struggling ''Philadelphia Inquirer'' shortly after Philadelphia Media Holdings bought the paper. After overcoming doubts about Tierney's neutrality in running the paper he had criticized in the past, Philadelphia Media Holdings has had to deal with the newspaper's falling circulation and advertising revenue; it has filed bankruptcy. On April 28, 2010, the Philadelphia Inquirer, Daily News and philly.com were sold at a bankruptcy auction to a group of the original lenders led by Angelo Gordon & Company as well as some new investors. The auction was rated a success in terms of the total price ($139 million), preservation of 2,500 jobs and dramatically reducing the company's long-term debt. The transaction has not yet closed. Mr. Tierney stepped down from his position as CEO of the company on May 21, 2010 in order to allow for a smooth transition. Several news accounts of his tenure have called him an "improbable savior"<ref>{{cite journal | first=Michael | last=Sokolove | date=August 6, 2009 | title=What's a Big City Without a Newspaper? | journal=The New York Times Magazine }}</ref> and an "unlikely warrior.".<ref>{{cite journal | first=David| last=Carr | date=August 11, 2010 | title=Defending the Papers He Fought | journal=The New York Times}}</ref> Other accounts have said, "For Tierney...his tenure as CEO by many measures could be rated a success." and "As for Tierney, give him credit for trying."<ref>{{cite journal | first=Joe | last=Strupp| date=August 29, 2010 | title=Give Philly Newspaper Boss a Hand | journal=Media Matters }}</ref> 

Outside of business, Tierney has been active in politics and a supporter of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] causes. Working for the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration in the 1980s, Tierney also worked in [[George W. Bush]]'s [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 Presidential election]] campaign, and [[Sam Katz (Philadelphia)|Sam Katz]]'s 2003 run for Philadelphia mayor. Tierney is also an active member of numerous [[board of directors]] including [[Nutrisystems Diet|NutriSystem]] and his old school, [[The Episcopal Academy]].

==Early life==
Brian Tierney is the fourth of five sons of James and Claire Tierney. Growing up in [[Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania]], he attended [[Waldron Mercy Academy]] and later [[The Episcopal Academy]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Life with Brian |publisher=[[American Journalism Review]] |author=Rachel Smolkin |url=http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4149 |date= August/September 2006 |accessdate=December 5, 2009 }}</ref> When he was seven, his family moved to [[Springfield Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Springfield Township, Pennsylvania]]. In 1975, at the age of eighteen, Tierney unsuccessfully sought the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination for township commissioner of Springfield. During the campaign supporters of his opponent in the Democratic primary had torn down his campaign posters and stole other campaign items. Tierney became a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] after the primary when a few Republicans who said they would look out for his stuff during his primary campaign, invited him to a party meeting.<ref name="life">{{cite journal | first=Rachel | last=Smolkin  | date=August/September, 2006 | title=Life with Brian | journal=American Journalism Review |url=http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4149 | accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | first=Katherine| last=Seelye| date= May 29, 2006 | title=In High School, Early to the Party | journal=New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/29/business/media/29tierney.html?_r=1&scp=5&sq=In%20High%20School%20Early%20to%20the%20Party&st=cse | accessdate=2009-08-10}}</ref>

He graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1979, majoring in political science. At the University of Pennsylvania, Tierney ran the Penn Students for [[Gerald Ford]] campaign, and, at the age of twenty-two, moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] where he worked for the [[Republican National Committee]] in various positions, including as a messenger between [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration and Republican candidates across the country. Tierney moved back to the [[Philadelphia]] region as a Reagan appointee in the U.S. Small Business Administration's public affairs office. In 1987, he received a law degree from [[Widener University]]. Tierney married in 1980 and has two children.<ref name="weekly">{{cite journal | first=Steve | last=Volk | date=May 31, 2006 | title=Brian Tierney Makes a Pledge | journal=Philadelphia Weekly |url=http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/view.php?id=12286 | accessdate=2008-10-17 | format= &ndash; <sup>[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=author%3AVolk+intitle%3ABrian+Tierney+Makes+a+Pledge&as_publication=Philadelphia+Weekly&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080612110248/http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/view.php?id=12286 |archivedate = June 12, 2008}} {{dead link|date=April 2009}}</ref>

==Public relations==
While earning his law degree at Widener University, Tierney founded Tierney & Company [[Public Relations]] in 1984, which he financed on his credit card. In 1986, he sold the company to Lewis Gilman & Kynett.<ref name="SBA">{{cite web | title=Brian Tierney, Esq. Chief Marketing Officer, Advanta Corp | publisher=U.S. Small Business Administration | url=http://www.sba.gov/50/Brian-Tierney.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2008-10-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051104070422/http://www.sba.gov/50/Brian-Tierney.pdf |archivedate = November 4, 2005}}</ref> Tierney stayed with Lewis Gilman & Kynett and by the time he turned twenty-nine he had become president and CEO of the public relations division.<ref name="weekly"/> In 1989, he left Lewis Gilman & Kynett and founded Tierney Group, another public relations company, with just three people. One of those people remembers Tierney's saying "We need to look at what everyone else is charging and charge our clients $15 an hour more." When told that was crazy Tierney responded, "We're going to be the best at what we do. We need to charge people accordingly."<ref name="phillymagazine">{{cite journal | first=Steve | last=Volk | date=February 2009 | title=1978 Called.

In 1994 Tierney, in association with [[Chicago]]-based True North Communications, made a deal with Foote, Cone & Belding Communications to take control of FCB Philadelphia. FCB Philadelphia, which up to 1989 was Lewis Gilman & Kynett, was renamed FCB/Tierney in May 1994 and renamed again in 1995 to Tierney & Partners.<ref name="nyt94"/><ref name="nyt">{{cite journal | first=Stuart | last=Elliott | date=April 17, 1998 | title=Deals at True North And Hill & Knowlton | journal=The New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE7D7153CF934A25757C0A96E958260 | accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | date=June 22, 1995 | title=True North Communications Announces Name Change of FCB Tierney to Tierney & Partners | journal=PR Newswire |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17110936.html | accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref> Tierney built the company into one of the largest public relations and advertising firms in the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid Atlantic]]. Tierney's clients included [[IBM]], [[McDonald's]], [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]], [[Exelon|PECO Energy]] and the [[Pennsylvania Lottery]].<ref name="weekly"/><ref name="nyt"/> The company created an award winning advertising campaign for Verizon starring [[James Earl Jones]] and the slogan "Philadelphia: The place that loves you back" for the [[Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corporation]]. Other advertising campaigns included wrapping a giant [[hoagie]] around [[Philadelphia City Hall]] to promote [[Wawa Food Markets]] and an ad campaign to prevent a hostile takeover of PECO Energy by [[Enron]].<ref name="life"/>

===Cipriano affair===
Along with promotions, Tierney would advocate for his clients when targeted by news reporters. Tierney would contact news editors to complain about coverage of his clients, accusing news reporters of being biased, incompetent and unprofessional. The most notable of Tierney's complaints to reporters was directed at ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' and ''Inquirer'' reporter Ralph Cipriano.<ref name="life"/><ref name="weekly"/><ref name="inquirer1">{{cite journal | first=Ken | last=Dilanian | date=May 24, 2006 | title=Frequent critic of media takes newspapers' helm | journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer }}</ref>

Ralph Cipriano was ''The Philadelphia Inquirer''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> religion reporter for about a year in 1993. During that time he was called several times by Tierney on behalf of Tierney's client, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia]]. After leaving the religion reporter position, Cipriano wrote articles for the Sunday paper, where in 1997 he wrote a profile on [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Anthony Bevilacqua]]. The profile turned into an investigative piece as Cipriano obtained documents detailing US$5 million in questionable spending and how the church was spending millions in the suburbs while cutting inner-city services.<ref name="weekly"/>
 
While Cipriano worked on the piece, he and his editors, Jonathan Neumann and [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner Robert Rosenthal, were contacted by Tierney. Tierney accused Ralph Cipriano of using inaccurate facts, trespassing and creating a protest at the Archdiocese's vacation home in [[Ventnor City, New Jersey]], all of which Cipriano denies. Cipriano says that Tierney indicated to him that it was the Archdiocese that had gotten him removed from the religion reporter position, a position Cipriano says he thought he left on his own. Also according to Cipriano, Tierney indicated that if Cipriano was involved in any story about the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, Tierney would start a public relations campaign to ruin Cipriano and ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', a charge that Tierney denies.<ref name="weekly"/>

The story Cipriano originally  wanted in ''The Inquirer'' was never published.<ref name="weekly"/> Cipriano accused ''The Inquirer'' of censoring his report and giving into demands from the Archdiocese.<ref name="inquirer1"/> Cipriano eventually was published in the ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'' and editor Robert Rosenthal accused Cipriano of bias and not being able to prove his stories. Rosenthal said Cipriano "has a very strong personal point of view and an agenda...There were things we didn't publish that Ralph wrote that we didn't think were truthful. He could never prove them."<ref>{{cite journal |first=Howard |last=Kurtz | date=June 13, 1998 |title=Crossed Agendas: Church vs. Reporter  |journal=The Washington Post }}</ref> Cipriano sued Rosenthal and ''The Inquirer'' for [[Defamation|libel]] and the case was later settled out of court. In an 2001 interview with the ''[[Editor & Publisher]]'', Cardinal Bevilacqua credited Tierney with stopping the story and noted that ''The Philadelphia Inquirer''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> stories about the Archdiocese have been more positive.<ref name="weekly"/> In 1998 Tierney was named a [[Order of St. Gregory the Great|Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great]] by [[Pope John Paul II]].<ref name="life"/>

===Later ventures===
Tierney Group and Tierney & Partners, later renamed Tierney Communications, was bought by True North Communications in 1998, which is now part of [[Interpublic Group of Companies|Interpublic Group]].<ref name="weekly"/> Tierney continued as CEO until April 2002, when he stepped down. He continued with Tierney Communications as chairman until December 1, 2003, when Tierney resigned and announced he was founding a new public relations firm, T2 Group.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Van Allen | date=December 12, 2003 |title=It's life after Brian at Tierney |journal=Philadelphia Business Journal |url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2003/12/15/story7.html | accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref>

T2 Group lasted until June 2004 when Tierney announced it was being bought by credit card company [[Advanta]] and that Tierney and most of T2's management would be hired by Advanta.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Van Allen | date=June 14, 2004 |title=T2 Group closing, execs going to Advanta |journal=Philadelphia Business Journal |url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2004/06/14/daily2.html | accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref><ref name="advanta">{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Van Allen | date=April 20, 2005 |title=Advanta, Brian Tierney reach separation deal |journal=Philadelphia Business Journal |url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2005/04/18/daily32.html | accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref> Tierney became vice chairman of Advanta, but in February 2005, Advanta announced Tierney was no longer serving as vice-chairman. The company gave no explanation as to why Tierney lost the position and Tierney's employment with the company ended the next month.<ref name="advanta"/>

==Philadelphia Media Holdings==
[[Image:Inquirerbldg sign.jpg|right|thumbnail|200px|The Inquirer Building.]]
In 2005 Tierney attempted to buy magazines [[Inc. (magazine)|''Inc.'']] and [[Fast Company (magazine)|''Fast Company'']] from [[Gruner + Jahr]], but failed.<ref name="fortune">{{cite journal |first=Devin |last=Leonard | date=November 13, 2006 |title=A PR magnate struggles to revive a newspaper |journal=Fortune |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/11/27/8394325/index.htm | accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref>  Tierney tried again to enter the media industry in March 2006 when he assembled a group of mostly former clients or people that are with him on the board of the Episcopal Academy to buy Philadelphia Newspapers Inc. He and other local businessman formed [[Philadelphia Media Holdings]] LLC and bought ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' and philly.com for US$515 million from [[The McClatchy Company]] which was selling off newspapers in low growth markets after buying Philadelphia Newspapers Inc.'s parent company [[Knight Ridder]].<ref name="media" /> The buyout was met with skepticism by many at ''The Inquirer'', especially by reporters who had been contacted in the past by Tierney on behalf of his clients. Tierney allayed fears with the members of Philadelphia Media Holdings signing a pledge not to interfere with the paper's [[editorial independence]]. Tierney said he would combat ''The Inquirer''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> decreasing revenue by spending millions on advertisements and promotions and not by laying off staff.<ref name="inquirer1" /><ref name="fortune" /> Tierney assumed the role as publisher of ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' in August 2006 after former publisher Joe Natoli resigned for a job at the [[University of Miami]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Joseph N. |last=DiStefano | date=August 2, 2006 |title=Tierney to fill role of Inquirer publisher |journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer}}</ref>

''The Inquier''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> circulation has been dropping since the 1980s, and except for briefly seeing a rise in weekday circulation in 2007, ''The Philadelphia Inquirer''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> weekday and Sunday circulation has continued to steadily drop since Philadelphia Media Holdings bought the paper.<ref>{{cite journal | date=November 5, 2007 |title=Good news/bad news for Inquirer circulation |journal=Philadelphia Business Journal |url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2007/11/05/daily8.html | accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | date=April 28, 2008 |title=Inquirer circulation slips |journal=Philadelphia Business Journal |url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2008/04/28/daily8.html | accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref> Loss of circulation combined with an unexpected drop in advertising revenue have forced more than 400 job cuts at ''The Inquirer'' and ''Daily News'' since they were bought by Philadelphia Media Holdings.<ref name="phillymagazine" /><ref>{{cite journal | date=February 27, 2008 |title=Philadelphia Inquirer, Daily News owner cuts 68 jobs |journal=Philadelphia Business Journal |url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2008/02/25/daily27.html | accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Joann |last=Loviglio | date=January 3, 2007 |title=Philadelphia Inquirer lays off 71 people |journal=BusinessWeek}}</ref> As Philadelphia Media Holdings financial situation worsened in 2008 employees began complaining about how management has been monitoring things such as bathroom breaks and the coffee they drink, and that Tierney has been patrolling the parking garage seeing what time employees arrive for work.<ref name="phillymagazine" /> Despite efforts to manage the financial strain, on February 21, 2009, Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, the subsidiary of Philadelphia Media Holdings that owns the paper, filled for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]]. The company hoped to restructure the US$390 million in debt it borrowed to buy the newspapers, but the end result was that the papers were auctioned off to the company's lenders.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Richard | last=P<U+00E9>rez-Pe<U+00F1>a | date=February 22, 2009 | title=Philadelphia Newspapers Seeking Bankruptcy | journal=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/business/media/23philly.html?ref=media | accessdate=2009-02-24}}</ref> The beginning of 2009 also saw the filing of a lawsuit that accused ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' of writing critical stories about Chester Community Charter School's use of public funds after business negotiations between school operator Vahan H.

==Other activities==
Tierney continued his political activism in 1990s and early 2000s by donating to local and national campaigns and headed [[George W. Bush]]'s outreach to Catholics in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 Presidential Election]]. Tierney was credited with helping generate votes for Bush and helping him win important states like Ohio and Missouri. Tierney also frequently appeared as a conservative voice on [[WPVI-TV]]'s ''Inside Story''. In 2003 Tierney headed [[Sam Katz (Philadelphia)|Sam Katz]]'s third campaign for mayor of Philadelphia, which he lost to incumbent mayor [[John F. Street]]. During the campaign, Tierney was involved in a highly publicized dispute with Neil Oxman. Oxman was a political consultant and friend of Sam Katz who worked on Katz's 1999 run for mayor. Oxman left Katz's 2003 campaign because he was unable to work with Tierney, saying Tierney was a "shameless self-promoter" and "full of bullshit". Katz praised Tierney, who he said was full of optimism, which Katz said was a great asset when things were going poorly in the campaign and in Katz's personal life.<ref name="life"/>

Tierney is a member of numerous [[board of directors]] in the Philadelphia area. He has been on the boards of [[Thomas Jefferson University]], the [[Philadelphia Zoo|Zoological Society of Philadelphia]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania]], among others.<ref>{{cite journal | date=August 1, 2002 |title=Tierney elected director of Fastnet |journal=Philadelphia Business Journal |url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2002/07/29/daily40.html | accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref> A member of the board for [[Nutrisystems Diet|NutriSystem]], Tierney played an important role in the company's turnaround with the decision to dramatically increase the marketing budget.<ref name="fortune"/> As a member of the board of  the Episcopal Academy, Tierney galvanized the board of directors to buy land in [[Newtown Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Newtown Square, Pennsylvania]] and move the school there. In 2001, the school's board of trustees approved the preliminary step of buying {{convert|123|acre|1}} of farmland in Newtown Square. Tierney, along with fellow board member Brian O'Neill, led a ninety day campaign to raise the US$20 million needed for the property.<ref name="life"/><ref>{{cite journal |first=Tom |last=McGrath | date=September, 2008 |title=The 212,000,000 School |journal=Philadelphia Magazine |url=http://www.phillymag.com/articles/class_acts_the_212_000_000_school/ | accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref>
