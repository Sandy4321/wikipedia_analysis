'''B12 deficiency''' can potentially cause severe and irreversible damage, especially to the brain and nervous system.

The first deficiency symptom that was discovered was anemia characterized by enlarged blood corpuscles, so-called [[megaloblastic anemia]].

The anemia is thought to be due to problems in DNA synthesis, specifically in the synthesis of [[thymine]], which is dependent on products of the [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase#reaction|MTR reaction]]. Other cell lines such as [[white blood cell]]s and [[platelet]]s are often also low.  [[Bone marrow]] examination may show [[megaloblast]]ic [[hemopoiesis]].  The anemia is easy to cure with vitamin B12.

Far more serious is the damage to the nervous system that may occur due to deficiency.

Early and even fairly pronounced deficiency does not always cause distinct or specific symptoms. Common early symptoms are tiredness or a decreased mental work capacity, decreased concentration and decreased memory, irritability and depression.

Sleep disturbances may occur, because B12 may be involved in the regulation of the sleep wake cycle by the pineal gland (through melatonin)<ref name="pmid8981490">{{cite journal |author=Hashimoto S, Kohsaka M, Morita N, Fukuda N, Honma S, Honma K |title=Vitamin B12 enhances the phase-response of circadian melatonin rhythm to a single bright light exposure in humans |journal=Neurosci. Lett. |volume=220 |issue=2 |pages=129-32 |year=1996 |pmid=8981490 |doi=}}</ref>.

Neurological signs of B{{ssub|12}} deficiency, which can occur without anemia, include sensory disturbances due to damage to peripheral nerves caused by [[demyelination]] and irreversible nerve cell death. Symptoms include [[numbness]], tingling of the extremities, disturbed coordination and, if not treated in time, an [[ataxic gait]], a syndrome known as [[subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord]].

B12 deficiency can also cause symptoms of mania and psychosis.<ref name="ijnwvitaminb12">{{cite journal | author=Sethi NK, Robilotti E, Sadan Y | title=Neurological Manifestations Of Vitamin B-12 Deficiency | journal=The Internet Journal of Nutrition and Wellness | volume=2 | issue=1 | year=2005 | doi=}}</ref><ref name="imajvitaminb12">{{cite journal | author=Masalha R, Chudakov B, Muhamad M, Rudoy I, Volkov I, Wirguin I | title=Cobalamin-responsive psychosis as the sole manifestation of vitamin B12 deficiency | journal=Israeli Medical Association Journal | volume=3 | year=2001 | pages=701-703 | doi=}}</ref>  (Note: these references were chosen because they are freely available on the internet; other restricted references are also availalable.)

Recent studies have devalued a possible connection between B12 deficiency and Alzheimer's dementia, and such a correlation is unlikely as of June 2007.<ref name="pmid16917153">{{cite journal |author=Morris MC, Evans DA, Schneider JA, Tangney CC, Bienias JL, Aggarwal NT |title=Dietary folate and vitamins B-12 and B-6 not associated with incident Alzheimer's disease |journal=J.

==Causes of deficiency==
* Inadequate dietary intake of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. As the vitamin B<sub>12</sub> occurs naturally only in animal products (eggs, meat, milk) a [[vegan]] diet can produce a deficiency unless using supplements or eating enriched food.<ref>[http://www.pernicious-anaemia-society.org/whatispa.html Pernicious Anaemia Society - What is Pernicious Anaemia?], retrieved July 30, 2007.</ref> Some vegans dispute this, claiming that [[vitamin]] B{{ssub|12}} is only manufactured by [[prokaryotic]] [[microorganisms]], not in food [[livestock]].{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

* Selective impaired absorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> due to [[intrinsic factor]] deficiency. This may depend on loss of [[stomach|gastric]] [[parietal cells]] in chronic [[atrophic gastritis]] (in which case, the resulting [[megaloblastic anaemia]] takes the name of "[[pernicious anaemia]]"), or on wide surgical resection of stomach (such as in [[bariatric surgery]]), or on rare hereditary causes of impaired synthesis of intrinsic factor.

* Impaired absorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> in the setting of a more generalised [[malabsorption]] or [[maldigestion]] syndrome. This includes any form of structural damage or wide surgical resection of the terminal [[ileum]] (the principal site of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption), forms of [[achlorhydria]] (including that artificially induced by drugs such as [[proton pump inhibitors]]), as well as [[bacterial overgrowth]] (such as in [[blind loop syndrome]]).

* Chronic intestinal infestation by the [[fish tapeworm]] ''[[Diphyllobothrium]]'', that competes for vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, seizing it for its own use and therefore leaving insufficient amount for the host organism. This is mostly confined to [[Scandinavia]] and parts of [[Eastern Europe]] (for example, in preparers of [[gefilte fish]], who would acquire the tapeworm by sneaking bits of uncooked fish while making the Eastern European delicacy, now eaten by [[Jews]] at [[Pesach]]).

* The [[diabetes]] medication, [[metformin]] may interfere with B12 dietary absorption.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ting R, Szeto C, Chan M, Ma K, Chow K | title = Risk factors of vitamin B(12) deficiency in patients receiving metformin | journal = Arch Intern Med | volume = 166 | issue = 18 | pages = 1975-9 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 17030830}}</ref>.

* Hereditary causes such as severe [[MTHFR]] deficiency, [[homocystinuria]], and [[transcobalamin]] deficiency.

==B12 deficiency is very common==

Recent research indicates that B12 deficiency is far more widespread than formerly believed. A large study in the US found that 39 percent had low values.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2000/000802.htm |title=B12 Deficiency May Be More Widespread Than Thought / August 2, 2000 / News from the USDA Agricultural Research Service |accessdate=2007-07-01 |format= |work=}}</ref> This study at Tufts University used the B12 concentration 258 pmol/l (= 350 pg/liter) as a criterion of "low level". However, recent research has found that B12 deficiency may occur at a much higher B12 concentration (500-600 pg/l). On this basis Mitsuyama and Kogoh <ref>{{cite journal | author=Mitsuyama Y, Kogoh H.  | journal=Japanese Journal of Psychiatry and Neurology| year=1988 | title=Serum and cerebrospinal fluid vitamin B12 levels in demented patients with CH3-
B12 treatment. | pages=65-71| volume=42 | issue=1 }}</ref>. proposed 550 pg/l, and Tiggelen et al <ref>{{cite journal | author=VanTiggelen CJM, Peperkamp JPC, TerToolen JFW. | journal=Journal of Orthomolecular Psychiatry  | year=1983 | title=Vitamin-B12 levels of cerebrospinal fluid in patients with organic mental disorder. | pages=305-11 | volume= | issue=12 }}</ref> proposed 600 pg/l. Against this background, there are reasons to believe that B12 deficiency is present in a far greater proportion of the population than 39% as reported by the Tufts University.

B12 deficiency is even more common in the elderly <ref>{{cite journal | author = H.W. Baik, R.M. Russell (1999)| title = Vitamin b12 deficiency in the elderly. Annual Review of Nutrition 19: 357-377}}</ref>. This is because B{{ssub|12}} absorption decreases greatly in the presence of atrophic gastritis, which is common in elderly. 

B12 deficiency is common among vegetarians. In vegans the risk is very high because none of their natural food sources contain B12. One American study found blood levels below normal in 92 % of vegans, 64 % of lactovegetarians, 47 % of lacto-ovovegetarians <ref>{{cite journal | author = Dong A and Scott SC (1982)| title = Ann Nutr Metab 26(4):209-16 }}</ref>. The study applied the old normal values, so in reality a considerably greater proportion may have been deficient.

==Diagnosis of B{{ssub|12}} deficiency==
Serum B{{ssub|12}} levels are often low in B{{ssub|12}} deficiency, but if other features of B{{ssub|12}} deficiency are present with normal B{{ssub|12}} then the diagnosis must not be discounted.  One possible explanation for normal B{{ssub|12}} levels in B{{ssub|12}} deficiency is antibody interference in people with high titres of [[intrinsic factor antibody]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Hamilton MS, Blackmore S, Lee A. | journal=Brit Med J | year=2006 | title=Possible cause of flase normal B-12 assays (letter) | pages=654&ndash;5 | volume=333 | issue=7569 }}</ref>  
Some researchers propose that the current standard norms of vitamin B12 levels are too low{{Fact|date=July 2007}}.  In Japan, the lowest acceptable  level for vitamin B12 in blood has been raised from about 200 picograms/litre (pg/l) = 145  picomol/litre (pm/l) to 550 pg/l = 400 pm/l{{Fact|date=July 2007}}. <ref>{{cite journal | author=Mitsuyama Y, Kogoh H.  | journal=Japanese Journal of Psychiatry and Neurology| year=1988 | title=Serum and cerebrospinal fluid vitamin B12 levels in demented patients with CH3-
B12 treatment. | pages=65-71| volume=42 | issue=1 }}</ref>  

Serum Homocysteine and Methylmalonic acid levels are considered more reliable indicators of B12 deficiency than the concentration of B12 in blood, see for example research at the St Louis University [http://www.news-medical.net/?id=5908 "Test used to diagnose B12 deficiency may be inadequate"] . The levels of these substances are high in B{{ssub|12}} deficiency and can be helpful if the diagnosis is unclear.  Approximately 10% of patients with vitamin B12 levels between 200-400pg/l will have a vitamin B12 deficiency on the basis of elevated levels of [[homocysteine]] and [[methylmalonic acid]].{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

Routine monitoring of [[methylmalonic acid]] levels in urine is an option for people who may not be getting enough dietary B{{ssub|12}}, as a rise in [[methylmalonic acid]] levels may be an early indication of deficiency.<ref name="donaldson">Donaldson MS. Metabolic vitamin B{{ssub|12}} status on a mostly raw vegan diet with follow-up using tablets, nutritional yeast, or probiotic supplements. Ann Nutr Metab. 2000;44(5-6):229-34. PMID 11146329.</ref>

If nervous system damage is suspected, B12 analysis in cerebrospinal fluid can also be helpful, though such an invasive test would be applicable only after unrevealing blood testing.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Devalia V | title=Diagnosing vitamin B-12 deficiency on the basis of serum B-12 assay | journal=Brit J Med | year=2006 | volume=333 | issue=7564 | pages=385-6 | id= PMID 16916826 }}</ref>

==Treatment of B{{ssub|12}} deficiency==
B{{ssub|12}} can be supplemented in healthy subjects by oral pill; [[sublingual]] pill, liquid, or strip; or by injection.  B{{ssub|12}}  is available singly or in combination with other supplements.  B{{ssub|12}}  supplements are available in forms including [[cyanocobalamin]], [[hydroxocobalamin]], [[methylcobalamin]], and [[adenosylcobalamin]] (sometimes called "cobamamide" or "dibencozide").

Vitamin B{{ssub|12}} can be given as intramuscular injections of [[hydroxycobalamin]], [[methylcobalamin]], or [[cyanocobalamin]]. Body stores (in the liver) are refilled with half a dozen  injections in the first couple of weeks and then maintenance with monthly to quarterly injections throughout the life of the [[patient]].

B{{ssub|12}} has traditionally been given [[parenterally]] to ensure absorption. However, oral replacement is now an accepted route, as it has become increasingly appreciated that sufficient quantities of B{{ssub|12}} are absorbed when large doses are given. This absorption does not rely on the presence of intrinsic factor or an intact ileum. Generally 1 to 2 mg daily is required as a large dose [http://www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/content/full/92/4/1191]. By contrast, the typical Western diet contains 5&ndash;7 <U+00B5>g of B{{ssub|12}} ([[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) Daily Value <ref>{{cite web| url = http://dietary-supplements.info.nih.gov/factsheets/vitaminb12.asp | title = Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Vitamin B12| publisher = National Institutes of Health: Office of Dietary Supplements | accessdate = 2006-06-06 }}</ref>).

[[Hypokalemia]], an excessive low [[potassium]] level in the [[blood]], is anecdotally reported as a complication of vitamin B{{ssub|12}} repletion after deficiency.  Excessive quantities of [[potassium]] are used by newly growing and dividing [[hematopoeitic]] cells, depleting circulating stores of the [[mineral]].

It has been appreciated since the 1960s that deficiency can sometimes be treated with oral B{{ssub|12}} supplements when given in sufficient doses. When given in oral doses ranging from 0.1&ndash;2 mg daily, B{{ssub|12}} can be absorbed in a pathway that does not require an intact ileum or intrinsic factor. However, with the advent of sublingual and intranasal administration, tablet usage is becoming outdated. <ref>{{cite journal | author= Antoinette M. Kuzminski ''et al''| title= Effective Treatment of Cobalamin Deficiency With Oral Cobalamin| journal= Blood| year= 1998| volume= 92| issue= 4| pages= 1191-1198| id= PMID 9694707}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | journal=Fam Pract | year=2006 | volume=23 | issue=3 | pages=279-85 | title=Oral vitamin B12 versus intramuscular vitamin B12 for vitamin B12 deficiency: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials | author=Butler CC, Vidal-Alaball J, Cannings-John R, ''et al.'' | id=PMID 16585128 }}</ref> Oral absorption is limited so regular intramuscular injections or sublingual/intranasal administration of a cobalamin (preferably methyl- or hydroxycobalamin) is necessary to restore systemic stores to physiological  levels. Recent research indicates that sublingual administration eliminates a deficiency as well as injections (reference will be added) with the advantage of evading the allergy risk.
