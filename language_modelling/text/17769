"'''If I Were a Boy'''" is a [[pop music|pop]] song by American [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]]. It was composed by [[Toby Gad]] and [[BC Jean]]. Jean initially recorded her version of the song which was rejected by Jean's record company. Knowles then recorded a new version for her third studio album, ''[[I Am<U+2026> Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008). The song was released as the album's [[lead single]] to U.S. radio on October 8, 2008 alongside "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]".  "If I Were a Boy" is different from her previous songs as the song is not a traditional R&B one. The lyrics of the song are a reference to an expression of sadness about misunderstanding between the genders and an indictment of the male side of relationships.

The song stands as the only song on either disc of ''I Am... Sasha Fierce'' that Knowles did not co-write. A Spanish version of the song titled "Si Yo Fuera un Chico" is included on the version of the album sold exclusively on [[iTunes Store|Itunes Stores]] in Spain and Mexico. Upon its release, "If I Were a Boy" was generally well-received by music critics who praised Knowles' tormented performance, emotional and passionate vocals and called the song her best work till date. The music video for the song was directed by Jake Nava and was shot in [[black and white]]. Knowles premiered the music video, alongside the video for "Single Ladies" on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Total Request Live]]'' show on October 13, 2008. A Spanish version of the video also exists.

The single was a commercial success, topping the charts in over eight European countries and peaking at number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States. It also peaked at number one in the United Kingdom and it is Knowles' best-selling single in the United Kingdom, so far. It earned multi-platinum certifications in Australia, in Canada, in Denmark, in New Zealand, in Spain, in Switzerland and in the United States. The song was promoted by several live performances of Knowles in televised shows, including the ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', in several awards ceremonies, including the [[52nd Grammy Awards]] and her world tour [[I Am... Tour]]. "If I Were a Boy" was covered by American country singer [[Reba McEntire]] on CMT Unplugged.

==Background and release==
"If I Were a Boy" was written by [[BC Jean]] as well as Toby Gad and produced by Gad and Knowles.<ref name="Booklet"/> Jean wrote most of the song's lyrics by taking inspiration from a bad break-up.<ref name="Billing">{{cite web|url=http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/bcjean123.htm|title=BC Jean Co-Writes #1 Hit "If I Were A Boy" for Beyonce, Signs With J Records and Releases Debut Single|last=Widran|first=Jonathan|publisher=Songwriter Universe|accessdate=2010-12-24}}</ref> One day while Jean and producer Tony Gad were strolling around Times Square, they came across a pizzeria on the side of the road. While tempted, Jean refrained from eating a pizza as she was dieting. She then started thinking about how if she were a boy, she would have eat one without regrets. After reflecting on the idea, she thought that if she was indeed a boy, she would have been a better man than her past lover.<ref name="Billing"/> Gad encouraged her to record her ideas for the studio. Once there, she came up with the lyrics and melody and recorded the song in less than half an hour. After completing her version, her record company rejected the song.<ref name="Billing"/> Knowles then recorded a new version and put it on the first disc of the third studio album, ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]''.<ref name="tele">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/neilmccormick/5690438/Beyonce_vs_BC_Jean_girls_behaving_badly/|title=Beyonc<U+00E9> vs BC Jean: girls behaving badly |last=McCormick |first=Neil|date=2008-11-10|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[David and Frederick Barclay]]|accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>

==Controversy==
Knowles was accused of stealing "If I Were A Boy" from upcoming singer BC Jean. [[Roger Friedman]], commenting for [[Fox News Channel]], published an account on October 14, 2008 of [[BC Jean]]'s side of the story stating she didn<U+2019>t even know that her song was recorded by Knowles until it hit the news and [[Matthew Knowles]] aggressively pursued the publishing rights to her song so that he could put Knowles' name on the writing credits.<ref name="ins">{{cite web |url=http://www.theinsider.com/news/1264111_Between_Beyonce_and_BC_Jean |title=Between Beyonce and BC Jean... |date=2008-10-15 |accessdate=2010-05-13 |work=[[The Insider (newspaper)|The Insider]]|publisher=Neri & Associates NeriVerbanac Public Affairs}}</ref> BC Jean took her [[Myspace]] account to express her frustration:
<blockquote>
"I have been reading some of these comments and to set the record straight from the horse<U+2019>s mouth <U+2013> IF I WERE A BOY is my song; YES, I wrote this song; It is my story; a painful one, and the song is very dear to me.

</blockquote>

It was soon proven however, that Knowles did not steal the song. In fact, after Jean's version of "If I Were a Boy" was rejected by her record company, [[Toby Gad]] took back the song and started marketing them to big name, established artists.<ref name="fox">{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,437442,00.html |title=Beyonce's 'Stolen' New Hit Record |date=2008-10-14 |accessdate=2010-05-13 |publisher=[[News Corporation]] |work=''[[Fox News Channel]]'' |author=[[Roger Friedman]]}}</ref> Knowles liked the song and recorded her version of "If I Were a Boy" for her album, ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]''.<ref name="tele"/> Fox News later reported that Knowles and Jean had come to terms. Part of their deal was that Knowles would have to record a duet for Jean's debut album, once she gets her own recording deal. However, this deal never went through to terms.<ref name="fox"/>

==Reception==
"If I Were a Boy" was generally well received by music critics who praised Knowles' tormented performance and called the song her best work yet. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine reviewer [[Chuck Taylor (Billboard writer and editor)|Chuck Taylor]] gave the song a positive review, writing that "If I Were a Boy" is Knowles' "most affecting offering" since the song '[[Listen (song)|Listen]]'. He praised her vocal performance calling it "breathtaking, exquisitely emotive, mournful and mature". He also went on saying that the song "exudes the fragrance of a [[Grammy Award]]."<ref name="bil">{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE49G7LJ20081017|title=Billboard singles reviews: Beyonce, Britney|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|date=2008-10-17|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Reuters|Reuters Group Limited, Reuters Group PLC]]|accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref> Bill Lamb of [[About.com]] initially stated on the album review that "If I Were a Boy" was bound to become an equally huge hit as Knowles 2006 single, '[[Irreplaceable]]'.

By contrast, Julian Marszalek of [[Dotmusic]] gave a mixed reception to the song, writing "If I Were a Boy" is indeed an interesting conceit for a ballad that explores the foibles of human nature. However, he said that, despite Knowles' best intentions to find out how men are, she would be best advised to leave the differences between the genders as a sweet little mystery, before the guys decide to find out what it would be like if they were girls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.launch.yahoo.com/081114/33/2206y.html |title=Beyonc<U+00E9> If I Were A Boy Single Review, New single reviews and latest single releases on Yahoo!

===Synopsis===
The video begins with Knowles and her husband saying a few words <U+2013> "intimacy," "honesty," "commitment" <U+2013>  and then they start saying the words <U+2013> "You." "Me." "Us." <U+2013> together. When the action starts, Knowles is working as a cop, and her boyfriend is so supportive that he makes her breakfast, spends time at work looking for the perfect present to brighten her day and forgoes hanging out with his attractive officemates so he can be available when she gets off her shift. Except, she's not thinking about him at all. Instead, she is spending her off-hours with her fellow cops, particularly her male partner, who she seems enamored with. Her husband tries calling, but she's ignoring the phone. And later, when her boyfriend gives her a present <U+2014> earrings <U+2014> she puts them on to go dancing with her cop partner at a party. Naturally, her husband is upset, and when he confronts her about this at home, she acts like he's making a big deal out of nothing: "When you act like that," he tells her, "I don't think you realize how it makes me look or feel." Knowles then asks him in a condescending tone: "Why are you so jealous?" she. "It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy." Then the story reverses, and Knowles starts to cry. The situation that she put her husband in, it turns out, is the situation she is in <U+2014> he is the cop, she is the supportive wife who was being taken for granted.
