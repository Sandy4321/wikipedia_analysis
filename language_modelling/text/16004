'''Saint Ignatius High School''' is a private [[Roman Catholic]], [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] high school for young men located in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. The school is renowned for its high standards of academic excellence, athletic program and its performing arts programs. Each year, nearly 100% of graduates go on to colleges and universities within one year of graduation.<ref name="Excellence">"Academic Excellence." Saint Ignatius High School Webpage. 11 February 2007 [http://www.ignatius.edu/genlinfo/excellence.shtm Ignatius.edu]</ref>

==History==
Founded in 1886 by a German Jesuit, on the invitation of Bishop Richard Gilmour, the school was originally a six-year secondary school based on the [[Gymnasia and Realgymnasia|German Gymnasium]] that was to be attended after the completion of six years of grammar school. Separate four-year high school and college programs were formed in 1902, with the college changing its name to [[John Carroll University]] in 1923 and moving out of the [[Cleveland]] location to neighboring [[University Heights, Ohio]] in 1935.

Saint Ignatius High School remains at its original location at 1911 West 30th Street to this day.  The campus includes the original structure, now known as the Main Building, which was completed in 1891 and is now a designated Cleveland Historic Landmark.<ref>"Facilities." Saint Ignatius High School Webpage. 11 February 2007 [http://www.ignatius.edu/genlinfo/facilities.shtm Ignatius.edu]</ref> On January 21, 1974, Saint Ignatius was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. 

Other buildings are Loyola Hall (originally St. Mary of the Assumption Elementary School), Clavius Science Center, Saint Mary of the Assumption Chapel (named after a church that once was located on the current campus), Father Sullivan, S.J. Gymnasium, Carroll Gymnasium, Murphy Field House, Kyle Field, and the O'Donnell Athletic Complex, which houses Wasmer Field and Dale Gabor Track. In addition, the $11.5 million state-of-the-art Breen Center for the Performing Arts replaced the Xavier Center in August 2009. It houses all student performing arts programs and hosts many events for other local arts groups. A new $3.3 million state-of-the-art Cafeteria has replaced the former Student Center, stage, senior lounge, and cooking areas. The food services opened in August 2006, and in August 2007 phase two of the project was completed with a renovated student center and a cafeteria with a broader selection than many college cafeterias. It was renamed the Rade Dining Hall. Both the St. Mary of the Assumption Chapel and the Murphy Field House projects were funded and overseen by [[Murlan J. Murphy]], who headed the Murphy-Phoenix Company, producers of [[Murphy Oil Soap]], until the company's acquisition by [[Colgate-Palmolive]] in 1991.<ref>''The Saint Ignatius Magazine'', Issue 1, 2006.</ref>

==Academics==
The school was recognized by the [[United States Department of Education]] as a "[[Blue Ribbon Schools Program|Blue Ribbon School]]" for the 1984-1985 and 2008-2009 [[school year]].<ref>[http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-1982.pdf ED.gov], Blue Ribbon Archive Page 65</ref><ref>[http://www.ignatius.edu/s/237/cmsindex.aspx?sid=237&gid=1&pgid=325&cid=3299&ecid=3299&crid=0&calpgid=347&calcid=3236 Ignatius.edu]</ref> A Blue Ribbon school must demonstrate a strong commitment to educational excellence.

==Service==
The school shares its motto "Men for Others" (attributed to Father [[Pedro Arrupe]], S.J.) with nearly every other Jesuit school,<ref name="Philosophy">"Philosophy." Saint Ignatius High School Webpaghe. 11 February 2007 [http://www.ignatius.edu/genlinfo/philosophy.shtm Ignatius.edu]</ref> and challenges its students to be "open to growth, intellectually competent, religious, loving, and committed to doing justice" in accordance with the expectations set forth by the school's "Graduate at Graduation" ("Grad at Grad") document.<ref name="Philosophy"/>

The school is located in the heart of the [[Ohio City (Cuyahoga County), Ohio|Ohio City]] neighborhood on the Near West Side of Cleveland, which it provides support to through community involvement programs like the [[Pedro Arrupe|Arrupe]] Neighborhood Partnership Program and the [[Saint Benedict Joseph Labre]] Ministry (a program in which faculty and students build relationships with the homeless through weekly visitation).  The high school was the first in the country to institute a for-credit compulsory service called "Sophomore Service".<ref>"Sophomore Service Program Homepage." Saint Ignatius High School Webpage. 11 February 2007 [http://www.ignatius.edu/sophservice/default.shtm Ignatius.edu]</ref> It also houses the St. Joseph of Arimethea Pallbearers Society, which sends upperclassmen to funerals of families who are unable to provide their own [[pallbearer]]s.<ref>Smith, Robert L.. Student group eases burden at funerals." Plain Dealer [[Cleveland]]11 November 2005, late ed.</ref>

==Fine arts program==
In 1990, a fine arts program was added to the school's curriculum. This program is growing, and includes an award-winning chorus and a recently-formed ''[[a cappella]]'' singing group, the "Cat-o'-tonics". The chorus has received awards in competitions, and the "Cat-o'-tonics" were awarded National Runner-up in the 2006 National Championship of High School A Cappella.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} There are many musical opportunities including Pep Band, Stage Band, Ignatius Brass, [[Jazz]] Band, Liturgical Musicians, and others.<ref name="Band">"Ignatius Band Program Homepage." Saint Ignatius High School Webpage. 11 February 2007 [http://www.ignatius.edu/band/default.shtm Ignatius.edu]</ref> The marching band has performed the Script Cats Show for 21 consecutive years, and has won many awards and honors at music festivals abroad.

===The Holy War===
A strong rivalry exists between Saint Ignatius and [[St. Edward High School (Lakewood, Ohio)|St. Edward High School]].  The two schools are quite similar in that both are Catholic, all-boys schools on the west side of the [[Greater Cleveland|Cleveland area]].  The schools are separated by only six miles.  One of the main reasons for the rivalry is that the schools draw from the same student pool of boys from west side Catholic grade schools.  Because of this, when the students face off in direct competition, they commonly are up against former grade school friends.

The schools both produce high-quality athletic teams, combining for over 70 state titles in the last 30 years with St. Edwards winning more than half of those titles.  The a majority of St. Edward's state titles have been in wrestling while St. Ignatius has spread their talent throughout many different sports.  While the schools compete in virtually all sports annually, the main event is the football match-up that draws upward of 13,000 fans.<ref> {{cite news | url =http://www.maxpreps.com/FanPages/Content/Article.mxp/ArticleID-7414f173-3f52-4893-850d-48788c7dcf2b | title =Ohio: Edmonds Runs Eagles Past St. Ignatius | date = 2006-10-17 | accessdate =2007-07-24 }}</ref>  The game is dubbed, "the [[Holy War (Boston College vs. Notre Dame)|Holy War]]" after the similar Catholic college football scenario between [[Boston College]] (a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school) and [[University of Notre Dame]] (a [[Congregation of Holy Cross|Holy Cross]] school). In addition, basketball games between the two schools (commonly twice a year) sell out at the hosting school's gymnasium.

Several match-ups live in the lore of Cleveland high school sports.  In 1993, the regular-season football match-up was regarded as one of the greatest Cleveland football games, resulting in a 35-34 3OT win for St. Ignatius.  While the schools are only six miles apart, in 1998 basketball regional lines were drawn along the Cleveland/Lakewood border and the two teams met in the Division I state championship, with St. Edward prevailing 70-61.<ref> {{cite news | url =http://www.yappi.com/boysbasketball/D1.html | title =Boys Basketball D1 State Champs | accessdate =2007-07-24 }}
</ref> The same scenario occurred in baseball in 2008, with St. Edward beating St. Ignatius 6-2 in the 2008 Baseball Division I State Championship game.

==Other extracurricular achievements==
* Ohio High School Speech League State Champions in [[Policy Debate]] 2001, 2004, 2006<ref>[http://www.ignatius.edu/genlinfo/schoolnews/2005-2006/policy.shtm Ignatius.edu] Announcement of Victory on Ignatius website</ref>
* In 2008 the [[Model United Nations]] team was awarded Top Overall Delegation at the 2008 [[Carnegie Mellon]] Model United Nations Conference.  On an individual level, St. Ignatius student Matt Manuszak was named "Most Outstanding Speaker" in the SPECPOL committee.
* In 2009 the Sports Information Department was awarded the NHSSPA's Gold Award for its work on the 2009 Saint Ignatius Football Media Guide.
