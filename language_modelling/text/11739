'''Usermaatre Osorkon IV''' was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]] during the late [[Third Intermediate Period]]. Traditionally considered the very last king of the [[22nd Dynasty]], he was ''[[de facto]]'' little more than ruler in [[Tanis]] and [[Bubastis]], in [[Lower Egypt]]. He is generally <U+2013> though not universally <U+2013> identified with the King '''Shilkanni''' mentioned by [[Assyria]]n sources, and with the [[biblical]] '''So, King of Egypt''' from the [[Books of Kings]].

Osorkon ruled during one of the most chaotic and politically fragmented period of ancient Egypt, in which the [[Nile Delta]] was dotted with small [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] kingdoms and principalities and ''[[Meshwesh]]'' dominions; as the last heir of the Tanite rulers, he inherited the easternmost parts of these kingdoms, thus the most involved in all the political and military upheavals that soon would afflict the [[Near East]]. During his reign, he had to face the power, and ultimately submit himself<U+2014>to the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kushite]] King [[Piye]] during Piye's conquest of Egypt. Osorkon IV also had to deal with the threatening [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] outside his eastern borders.

==Reign==

===Early years===
Osorkon IV ascended to the throne of Tanis in c.&nbsp;730 BCE,<ref>Kitchen 1996, <U+00A7>&nbsp;92</ref> at the end of the long reign of his predecessor [[Shoshenq V]] of the 22nd Dynasty,<ref name=berl>Berlandini 1979, pp.&nbsp;100<U+2013>101</ref><ref>Edwards 1982, p.&nbsp;569</ref><ref>Mitchell 1991, p.&nbsp;340</ref> who was possibly also his father.<ref name=G3301/> However, this somewhat traditional collocation was first challenged in 1970 by Karl-Heinz Priese who preferred to place Osorkon IV in a lower<U+2013>Egyptian branch of the [[23rd Dynasty]], right after the reign of the shadowy pharaoh [[Pedubast II]];<ref>Priese 1970, p.&nbsp;20 n.&nbsp;23</ref> this placement found the support of a certain number of scholars.<ref>Leahy 1990, p.&nbsp;89</ref><ref>von Beckerath 1997, p.&nbsp;99</ref><ref>see also Jansen-Winkeln 2006, pp.&nbsp;246<U+2013>47 and references therein.</ref><ref>Wilkinson (2011, p.&nbsp;XVIII) recognizes Osorkon IV as the last ruler of the 22nd Dynasty, though placing Pedubast II before him.</ref> Osorkon's mother, named on a [[electrum]] [[Aegis#In Egyptian and Nubian tradition|aegis]] of [[Sekhmet]] now in the [[Louvre]], was [[Tadibast III]].<ref name=berl/><br>
Osorkon IV's realm was restricted only to the district of Tanis (''R<U+02C1>-nfr'') and the territory of [[Bubastis]], both in the eastern [[Nile Delta]].<ref>Kitchen 1996, <U+00A7>&nbsp;82; 92</ref> His neighbors were Libyan princes and ''Meshwesh'' chiefs who ruled their small realms outside of his authority.<ref name=G3301>Grimal 1992, pp.&nbsp;330<U+2013>31</ref>

[[File:Stele Piye submission Mariette.jpg|thumb|Closeup of the ''Victory Stela'' of Piye. Osorkon IV is the left one among the prostrating kings.]]
Around 729/28 BCE, soon after his accession, Osorkon IV faced the [[Religious war|crusade]] led by the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kushite pharaoh]] [[Piye]] of the [[Nubia]]n [[25th Dynasty]]. Along with other rulers of Lower and [[Middle Egypt]] <U+2013> mainly [[Nimlot of Hermopolis|Nimlot]] of [[Hermopolis]], [[Iuput II]] of [[Leontopolis]] and [[Peftjauawybast]] of [[Herakleopolis]] <U+2013> Osorkon IV joined the coalition led by the Chief of the West [[Tefnakht]] in order to oppose the Nubian.<ref>Kitchen 1996, <U+00A7>&nbsp;325</ref> However, Piye's advance was unstoppable and the opposing rulers surrendered one after another: Osorkon IV found it wise to reach the Temple of [[Ra]] at [[Heliopolis (ancient)|Heliopolis]] and pay homage to his new overlord Piye personally<U+2014><ref>Grimal 1992, p.&nbsp;398</ref> an action which was soon imitated by the other rulers. As reported on his ''Victory Stela'', Piye accepted their submission, but Osorkon and most of the rulers were not allowed to enter the royal enclosure due to the fact that they were not [[circumcised]] and had eaten fish, both abominations in the eyes of the Nubian.<ref>Kitchen 1996, <U+00A7><U+00A7>&nbsp;325<U+2013>26</ref><ref>Wilkinson 2011, p.&nbsp;397</ref> Nevertheless, Osorkon IV and the others were allowed to keep their former domains and authority.<ref>Grimal 1992, p.&nbsp;339</ref><ref>Wilkinson 2011, p.&nbsp;398</ref>

===The Assyrian threat===
In 726/25 BCE [[Hoshea]], the last [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|King of Israel]], rebelled against the Assyrian King [[Shalmaneser V]] who demanded an annual tribute, and sought the support of ''So, King of Egypt'' ({{Bible verse|2|Kings|17:4|NIV}}) who, as already mentioned, was most likely Osorkon IV (see below). For reasons which remained unknown <U+2013> possibly in order to remain neutral towards the powerful [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], or simply because he didn't have enough power or resources <U+2013> King So didn't help Hoshea, who was subsequently defeated and deposed by Shalmaneser V. The Kingdom of Israel ceased to exist, and [[Assyrian captivity of Israel|many Israelites were brought to Assyria as exiles]].<ref name=G3412>Grimal 1992, pp.&nbsp;341<U+2013>42</ref><ref name=k333ff>Kitchen 1996, <U+00A7><U+00A7>&nbsp;333ff</ref>

[[File:Sargon II and dignitary (particular).jpg|thumb|left|Sargon II, Osorkon's Assyrian opponent.]]
In 720 BCE, a revolt occurred in Palestine against the new Assyrian King [[Sargon II]], led by King Hanno (also ''Hanun'' and ''Hanuna'') of Gaza who sought the help of "Pir<U+02BE>u of Musri", a term most probably meaning "Pharaoh of Egypt" and referring to Osorkon IV. Assyrian sources claims that this time the Egyptian king did send a ''[[turtanu]]'' (an army<U+2013>commander) called ''Re<U+02BE>e'' or ''Re<U+02BE>u'' (his [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name was Raia, though in the past it was read ''Sib<U+02BE>e'') as well as troops in order to support the neighboring ally. However, the coalition was defeated in battle at [[Rafah|Raphia]]: Re<U+02BE>e fled back to Egypt, Raphia and [[Gaza City|Gaza]] were looted and Hanno was [[Death by burning|burnt alive]] by the Assyrians.<ref name=G3412/><ref name=k333ff/> A different opinion came from [[Israeli]] scholar Dan'el Kahn who proposed an earlier datation for the accession of Piye's successor [[Shabaka]]: in his point of view, Shabaka was already ruling over the whole Egypt before 720 BCE, and Re<U+02BE>e was in fact a Nubian ''turtanu'' serving him rather than an Egyptian one serving Osorkon IV.<ref>Kahn 2001, pp.&nbsp;11<U+2013>12</ref>

In 716 BCE, Sargon II almost reached Egypt's boundaries. Feeling directly threatened this time, Osorkon IV (here called ''Shilkanni'' by Assyrian sources, see below) was carefully diplomatic: he personally met the Assyrian king at the "[[Brook of Egypt]]" (most likely [[el-Arish]]) and tributed him with a present which Sargon personally described as "twelve large horses of Egypt without equals in Assyria". The Assyrian king appreciated his gifts and did not take action against Osorkon IV.<ref>Kitchen 1996, <U+00A7>&nbsp;336</ref>

===End===
Shortly after, Osorkon IV and his dynasty vanished into obscurity. His death should have occurred between 715 and 713 BCE, after 16/18 years of reign,<ref>Kitchen 1996, <U+00A7>&nbsp;526; revised table 6</ref> as he was apparently gone when King Iamani of [[Ashdod]] sought refuge from Sargon II in Egypt around 712 BCE or possibly later, only to be caught by a pharaoh of the 25th Dynasty who returned him to the Assyrians in chains.<ref>Kitchen 1996, <U+00A7><U+00A7>&nbsp;463<U+2013>64</ref> Kahn believed that this pharaoh was Shabaka, who might have previously deposed Osorkon IV, "guilty" for being too philo-Assyrian.<ref>Kahn 2001, pp.&nbsp;9<U+2013>10</ref> Few decades later a man called [[Gemenefkhonsbak]], possibly a descendant of the now-defunct dynasty, claimed for himself the [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|pharaonic royal titles]] and ruled in Tanis as its prince.<ref>Kitchen 1996, <U+00A7>&nbsp;357</ref>

==Identification with Shilkanni and So==
It is believed that ''Shilkanni'' is a rendering of ''(U)shilkan'', which in turn is derived from ''(O)sorkon'' <U+2013> hence Osorkon IV <U+2013> as first proposed by [[William F. Albright]] in 1956.<ref>Albright 1956, p.&nbsp;24</ref><ref name=K115r>Kitchen 1996, <U+00A7>&nbsp;115</ref> This identification is accepted by several scholars<ref name=edw>Edwards 1982, p.&nbsp;576</ref><ref name=mitc>Mitchell 1991, p.&nbsp;345</ref><ref name=G3412/><ref>Kitchen 1996, <U+00A7>&nbsp;115; 463</ref><ref>Wilkinson 2011, pp.&nbsp;399<U+2013>400</ref><ref name=dod910>Dodson 2014, pp.&nbsp;9<U+2013>10</ref> while others remain uncertain<ref>Jansen-Winkeln 2006, p.&nbsp;260 & n.&nbsp;177</ref> or even skeptical.<ref>Yoyotte 1971, pp.&nbsp;43<U+2013>44</ref> Shilkanni is reported by Assyrians as "King of ''[[Musri]]''": this location, once believed to be a country in northern [[Arabia]] by the [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] Hans Alexander Winckler, is certainly to be identified with Egypt instead.<ref name=K115r/> In the same way, the "Pir'u of Musri" to whom Hanno of Gaza asked for help in 720 BCE could only have been Osorkon IV.<ref>Kitchen 1996, <U+00A7><U+00A7>&nbsp;335; 463</ref><br>
The identity of the biblical King ''So'' is somewhat less definite. Generally, an abbreviation of ''(O)so(rkon)'' is again considered the most likely by several scholars,<ref name=edw/><ref name=mitc/><ref name=kk>Kitchen 1996, <U+00A7><U+00A7>&nbsp;333ff;&nbsp;463<U+2013>64</ref><ref>Patterson 2003, pp.&nbsp;196<U+2013>97</ref><ref>Clayton 2006, pp.&nbsp;182<U+2013>83</ref><ref>Dodson 2014, p.&nbsp;9</ref> but the concurrent hypothesis which equates So with the city of [[Sais]], hence with King Tefnakht, is supported by a certain number of scholars.<ref>Goedicke 1963, pp.&nbsp;64<U+2013>66</ref><ref>Redford 1985, p.&nbsp;197 & n.&nbsp;56</ref><ref>see also Kitchen 1996, <U+00A7>&nbsp;463 and references therein.</ref><ref>Kahn 2001, pp.&nbsp;13<U+2013>14</ref>

==Attestations==
[[File:Louvre egide tete lionne.JPG|thumb|Small aegis of Sekhmet with the name of Osorkon and Tadibast, in the [[Louvre]].]]
Osorkon IV is attested by Assyrian documents (as Shilkanni and other epithets) and probably also by the Books of Kings (as King So), while [[Manetho]]'s [[epitome]]s seem to have ignored him.<ref>Kitchen 1996, <U+00A7>&nbsp;418</ref> He is undoubtedly attested by the well-known ''Victory Stela'' of Piye<ref>Jansen-Winkeln 2006, p.&nbsp;246, n.&nbsp;91</ref> on which he is depicted while prostrating in front of the owner of the stela along with other submitted rulers. Another findings almost certainly referring to him is the aforementioned aegis of Sekhmet, found at Bubastis and mentioning a King Osorkon son of queen Tadibast who, as not coinciding with any name of all the other Osorkon kings' mothers, can only be Osorkon IV's mother.<ref name=berl/>

===About the throne name===
Osorkon's [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary#Throne name (praenomen)|throne name]] was thought to be ''Aakheperre Setepenamun'' from a few monuments naming a namesake pharaoh Osorkon, such as a [[Egyptian faience|faience]] [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] and a block, but this attribution has been criticized by Frederic Payraudeau in 2000. According to him, these findings could rather be assigned to an earlier Aakheperre Osorkon i.e. the distant predecessor [[Osorkon the Elder]] of the [[21st Dynasty]], thus implying that Osorkon IV's real throne name was unknown.<ref>Payraudeau 2000, pp.&nbsp;78ff</ref> Furthermore, in 2010/11 a French expedition discovered in the Temple of [[Mut]] at Tanis few blocks bearing a relief of a King ''Usermaa(t)re Osorkonu'', here depicted in a quite archaizing style, which at first were attributed to [[Osorkon III]].<ref name=dod78>Dodson 2014, pp.&nbsp;7<U+2013>8</ref> In 2014, on the basis of the style of both the relief and the royal name, Aidan Dodson rejected the identification of this king with both the already known kings Usermaatre Osorkon ([[Osorkon II]] and III) and stated that he was rather Osorkon IV with his true throne name.<ref name=dod910/> A long-known, archaizing "glassy faience" statuette fragment from [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] now exhibited at the [[Petrie Museum]] (UC13128) which is inscribed for one King ''Usermaatre'', was tentatively attributed to several pharaohs from Piye to [[Rudamun]] of the [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] 23rd Dynasty and even to [[Amyrtaios]] of the [[28th Dynasty]], may in fact represent Osorkon IV.<ref>Brandl 2011, pp.&nbsp;17<U+2013>18</ref>
