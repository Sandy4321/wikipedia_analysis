'''Steve Asheim''' is the drummer and primary songwriter for the [[death metal]] band [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]]. Steve is also known to collect guns, which can be seen in Deicide's DVD ''When London Burns''.

On [[25 January]] [[2007]], when making a trip to a bank in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]] to make a deposit from Deicide merchandise sales, he was arrested on suspicion of connection with a recent bank robbery. Staff were perplexed by his appearance and attire, as well as the fact he was handling money marked in red dye. Detained by police in the local station, he explained the banknotes were legitimate proceeds from touring, and that he had a leaky pen in his pocket which was responsible for the money's discoloration. He was released without further charge.  [http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=65901]
