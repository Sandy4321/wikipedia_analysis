'''CWO3 Rose Franco''' (born January 22, 1934), a [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]], was the first Hispanic woman to become a [[Warrant Officer|Chief Warrant Officer]] in the [[United States Marine Corps]].

==Early years==
Franco was born and raised in the "[[barrio]]" Ensenada of [[Gu<U+00E1>nica, Puerto Rico]], which is located close to  the "Bahia de Gu<U+00E1>nica" (Gu<U+00E1>nica Bay) in the southwest part of Puerto Rico. Franco, who was born into a poor family, was able to finish her primary and secondary education. Franco  went to college for a brief period of time, were she took classes in [[business administration]].<ref>[http://www.dianasuniquedesigns.com/latinasinthemilitary.php Latinas in the Military]</ref>

==Marine service==
With the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], Franco surprised her family by announcing that she was leaving college to join the United States Marine Corps. Her family protested, because they believed that a women's destiny was to get married and to raise a family as a housewife. Franco, however had her own ideas and felt that it was her patriotic duty to serve in the armed forces. On February 8, 1952, at the age of 20, Franco enlisted and was sent to [[Camp Lejeune]] in [[North Carolina]] where she underwent basic training. Upon graduation, she was sent to [[Camp Lejeune]] in [[North Carolina]] for advanced training. After finishing her advanced training, Franco was assigned to the duties of administrative supply assistant at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]] in [[California]].<ref name="WM">[http://www.womensmemorial.org/H&C/History/historypr.html History Archive Puerto Rican Servicewomen Answer the Call to Serve]</ref> 

In 1956, she completed her four year enlistment and returned to Puerto Rico where she went to work for [[Pan American Airlines]].  She found her office job in the airline boring and soon she re-enlisted in the Marines. She was assigned to the First Marine Corps District in [[Garden City, New York|Garden City]], [[Long Island]], [[New York]]. During the night she attended [[Long Island University]]. After two years there, she was sent to work as an administrator at [[Parris Island, South Carolina|Parris Island]].<ref name="WM"/>
