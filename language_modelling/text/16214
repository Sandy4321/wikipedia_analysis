[[File:Skadi Hunting in the Mountains by H. L. M.jpg|thumb|''Skadi Hunting in the Mountains'' (1901) by H. L. M.]]
In [[Norse mythology]], '''Ska<U+00F0>i''' (sometimes anglicized as '''Skadi''', '''Skade''', or '''Skathi''') is a [[j<U+00F6>tunn]] and [[<U+00C6>sir|goddess]] associated with [[bowhunting]], [[ski]]ing, winter, and mountains. Ska<U+00F0>i is attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' and ''[[Heimskringla]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]], and in the works of [[skald]]s.

In all sources, Ska<U+00F0>i is the daughter of the deceased  [[<U+00DE>jazi]], and Ska<U+00F0>i married the god [[Nj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>r]] as part of the compensation provided by the gods for killing her father <U+00DE>jazi. In ''Heimskringla'', Ska<U+00F0>i is described as having split up with Nj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>r and as later having married the god [[Odin]], and that the two produced many children together. In both the ''Poetic Edda'' and the ''Prose Edda'', Ska<U+00F0>i is responsible for placing the serpent that drips venom onto the bound [[Loki]]. Ska<U+00F0>i is alternately referred to as '''<U+00D6>ndurgud''' (Old Norse "ski god") and '''<U+00D6>ndur[[d<U+00ED>s]]''' (Old Norse "ski [[lady]]").

The etymology of the name ''Ska<U+00F0>i'' is uncertain, but may be connected with the original form of ''[[Scandinavia]]''. Some place names in [[Scandinavia]], particularly in [[Sweden]], refer to Ska<U+00F0>i. Scholars have theorized a potential connection between Ska<U+00F0>i and the god [[Ullr]] (who is also associated with skiing and appears most frequently in place names in Sweden), a particular relationship with the j<U+00F6>tunn [[Loki]], and that ''Scandinavia'' may be related to the name Ska<U+00F0>i (potentially meaning "Ska<U+00F0>i's island"). Ska<U+00F0>i has inspired various works of art.

==Etymology==
The Old Norse name ''Ska<U+00F0>i'', along with ''[[Scandinavia|Sca(n)dinavia]]'' and ''[[Scania|Sk<U+00E1>ney]]'', may be related to [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''skadus'', Old English ''sceadu'', [[Old Saxon]] ''scado'', and [[Old High German]] ''scato'' (meaning "shadow"). Scholar John McKinnell comments that this etymology suggests Ska<U+00F0>i may have once been a personification of the geographical region of Scandinavia or associated with the underworld.<ref name=MCKINNELL63>McKinnell (2005:63).</ref>

[[Georges Dum<U+00E9>zil]] disagrees with the notion of ''Scadin-avia'' as etymologically "the island of the goddess Ska<U+00F0>i." Dum<U+00E9>zil comments that the first element ''Scadin'' must have had<U+2014>or once had<U+2014>a connection to "darkness" "or something else we cannot be sure of". Dum<U+00E9>zil says that, rather, the name ''Ska<U+00F0>i'' derives from the name of the geographical region, which was at the time no longer completely understood. In connection, Dum<U+00E9>zil points to a parallel in ''[[<U+00C9>riu]]'', a goddess personifying [[Ireland]] that appears in some Irish texts, whose name he says comes from ''Ireland'' rather than the other way around.<ref name=DUMEZIL35>Dum<U+00E9>zil (1973:35).</ref>

==Attestations==
Ska<U+00F0>i is attested in poems found in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', in two books of the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' and in one ''[[Heimskringla]]'' book.
===''Poetic Edda''===
[[Image:The Lovesickness of Frey.jpg|thumb|Nj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>r, Ska<U+00F0>i, and Freyr as depicted in ''The Lovesickness of Frey'' (1908) by W. G. Collingwood.]]
In the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Gr<U+00ED>mnism<U+00E1>l]]'', the god [[Odin]] (disguised as ''[[List of names of Odin|Gr<U+00ED>mnir]]'') reveals to the young [[Agnarr Geirr<U+00F6><U+00F0>sson|Agnarr]] the existence of twelve locations. Odin mentions the location [[<U+00DE>rymheimr]] sixth in a single stanza. In the stanza, Odin details that the j<U+00F6>tunn [[<U+00DE>jazi]] once lived there, and that now his daughter Ska<U+00F0>i does. Odin describes <U+00DE>rymheimr as consisting of  "ancient courts" and refers to Ska<U+00F0>i as "the shining bride of the gods".<ref name=LARRINGTON53>Larrington (1999:53).</ref> In the prose introduction to the poem ''[[Sk<U+00ED>rnism<U+00E1>l]]'', the god [[Freyr]] has become heartsick for a fair girl (the j<U+00F6>tunn [[Ger<U+00F0>r]]) he has spotted in [[J<U+00F6>tunheimr]]. The god [[Nj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>r]] asks Freyr's servant [[Sk<U+00ED>rnir]] to talk to Freyr, and in the first stanza of the poem, Ska<U+00F0>i also tells Sk<U+00ED>rnir to ask Freyr why he is so upset. Sk<U+00ED>rnir responds that he expects harsh words from their son Freyr.<ref name=LARRINGTON61>Larrington (1999:61).</ref>

In the prose introduction to the poem ''[[Lokasenna]]'', Ska<U+00F0>i is referred to as the wife of Nj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>r and is cited as one of the goddesses attending [[<U+00C6>gir]]'s feast.<ref name=LARRINGTON84>Larrington (1999:84).</ref> After [[Loki]] has an exchange with the god [[Heimdallr]],  Ska<U+00F0>i interjects. Ska<U+00F0>i tells Loki that he is "light-hearted" and that Loki will not be "playing [...] with [his] tail wagging free" for much longer, for soon the gods will bind Loki to a sharp rock with the ice-cold entrails of his son. Loki responds that, even if this is so, he was "first and foremost" at the killing of <U+00DE>jazi. Ska<U+00F0>i response that, if this is so, "baneful advice" will always flow from her "[[V<U+00E9> (shrine)|sanctuaries]] and plains". Loki responds that Ska<U+00F0>i was more friendly in speech when Ska<U+00F0>i was in his bed<U+2014>an accusation he makes to most of the goddesses in the poem and is not attested elsewhere. Loki's [[flyting]] then turns to the goddess [[Sif]].<ref name=LARRINGTON93AND276>Larrington (1999:93 and 276).</ref> 

In the prose section at the end of ''Lokasenna'', the gods catch Loki and bind him with the innards of his son [[Nari]], while they turn his son [[Narfi]] into a wolf. Ska<U+00F0>i places a [[venom]]ous snake above Loki's face. Venom drips from the snake and Loki's wife [[Sigyn]] sits and holds a basin beneath the serpent, catching the venom. When the basin is full, Sigyn must empty it, and during that time the snake venom falls on to Loki's face, causing him to writhe in a tremendous fury, so much so that all  [[earthquake]]s stem from Loki's writhings.<ref name=LARRINGTON95-96>Larrington (1999:95-96).</ref>

In the poem ''[[Hyndlulj<U+00F3><U+00F0>]]'', the female j<U+00F6>tunn Hyndla tells the goddess [[Freyja]] various mythological genealogies. In one stanza, Hyndla notes that <U+00DE>jazi "loved to shoot" and that Ska<U+00F0>i was his daughter.<ref name=LARRINGTON257>Larrington (1999:257).</ref>

===''Prose Edda''===
In the ''Prose Edda'', Ska<U+00F0>i is attested in two books: ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' and ''[[Sk<U+00E1>ldskaparm<U+00E1>l]]''.
====''Gylfaginning''====
[[Image:Nj<U+00F6>rd's desire of the Sea.jpg|right|thumb|''Nj<U+00F6>rd's desire of the Sea'' (1908) by [[W. G. Collingwood]]]]
[[File:Skadi's longing for the Mountains.jpg|right|thumb|''Skadi's longing for the Mountains'' (1908) by W. G. Collingwood]]
In chapter 23 of the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', the enthroned figure of [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|High]] details that Nj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>r's wife is Ska<U+00F0>i, that she is the daughter of the j<U+00F6>tunn <U+00DE>jazi, and recounts a tale involving the two. High recalls that Ska<U+00F0>i wanted to live in the home once owned by her father called <U+00DE>rymheimr. However, Nj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>r wanted to live nearer to the sea. Subsequently, the two made an agreement that they would spend [[numbers in Germanic paganism|nine]] nights in <U+00DE>rymheimr and then the next three nights in Nj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>r's sea-side home [[N<U+00F3>at<U+00FA>n]] (or nine winters in <U+00DE>rymheimr and another nine in N<U+00F3>at<U+00FA>n according to the ''[[Codex Regius]]'' manuscript<ref name=BYOCK141>Byock (2006:141).</ref>). However, when Nj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>r returned from the mountains to N<U+00F3>at<U+00FA>n, he said:
<blockquote>
:"Hateful for me are the mountains,
:I was not long there,
:only nine nights.
:The howling of the wolves
:sounded ugly to me
:after the song of the swans."<ref name=BYOCK34>Byock (2006:33-34).</ref>
</blockquote>
Ska<U+00F0>i responded:
<blockquote>
:"Sleep I could not
:on the sea beds
:for the screeching of the bird.
:That gull wakes me
:when from the wide sea
:he comes each morning."<ref name=BYOCK34>Byock (2006:33-34).</ref>
</blockquote>
The sources for these stanzas are not provided in the ''Prose Edda'' or elsewhere. High says that afterward Ska<U+00F0>i went back up to the mountains and lived in <U+00DE>rymheimr, and there Ska<U+00F0>i often travels on skis, wields a bow, and shoots wild animals. High notes that Ska<U+00F0>i is also referred to as "ski god" (Old Norse ''<U+00D6>ndurgud'') or <U+00D6>ndurdis and the "ski lady" (''<U+00D6>ndur[[d<U+00ED>s]]''). In support, the above mentioned stanza from the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''Gr<U+00ED>mnism<U+00E1>l'' is cited.<ref name=BYOCK141/> In the next chapter (24), High says that "after this", Nj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>r "had two children": Freyr and Freyja. The name of the mother of the two children is not provided here.<ref name=BYOCK35>Byock (2006:35).</ref>

At the end of chapter 51 of ''Gylfaginning'', High describes how the gods caught and bound Loki. Ska<U+00F0>i is described as having taken a venomous snake and fastening it above the bound Loki, so that the venom may dip on to Loki's face. Loki's wife Sigyn sat by his side and held a bowl out. The bowl catches the venom, but when the bowl becomes full Loki writhes in extreme pain, causing the earth the shake and resulting in what we know as an earthquake.<ref name=BYOCK70>Byock (2006:70).</ref>

====''Sk<U+00E1>ldskaparm<U+00E1>l''====
[[File:Skade by Saltza.jpg|thumb|right|''Skade'' (1893) by [[Carl Fredrik von Saltza]]]]
In chapter 56 of the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Sk<U+00E1>ldskaparm<U+00E1>l]]'', [[Bragi]] recounts to [[<U+00C6>gir]] how the gods killed <U+00DE>jazi. <U+00DE>jazi's daughter, Ska<U+00F0>i, took a helmet, a coat of mail, and "all weapons of war" and traveled to [[Asgard]], the home of the gods. Upon Ska<U+00F0>i's arrival, the gods wished to atone for her loss and offered compensation. Ska<U+00F0>i provides them with her terms of settlement, and the gods agree that Ska<U+00F0>i may choose a husband from among themselves. However, Ska<U+00F0>i must choose this husband by looking solely at their feet. Ska<U+00F0>i saw a pair of feet that she found particularly attractive and said "I choose that one; there can be little that is ugly about Baldr." However, the owner of the feet turned out to be Nj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>r.<ref name=FAULKES61>Faulkes (1995:61).</ref> 

Ska<U+00F0>i also included in her terms of settlement that the gods must do something she thought impossible for them to do: make her laugh. To do so, Loki tied one end of a cord around the beard of a [[goat|nanny goat]] and the other end around his [[testicle]]s. The goat and Loki drew one another back and forth, both squealing loudly. Loki dropped into Ska<U+00F0>i's lap, and Ska<U+00F0>i laughed, completing this part of her atonement. Finally, in compensation to Ska<U+00F0>i, Odin took <U+00DE>jazi's eyes, lunged them into the sky, and from the eyes made two stars.<ref name=FAULKES61/>

Further in ''Sk<U+00E1>ldskaparm<U+00E1>l'', a work by the [[skald]] [[<U+00DE><U+00F3>r<U+00F0>r Sj<U+00E1>reksson]] is quoted. The poem refers to Ska<U+00F0>i as "the wise god-bride" and notes that she "could not love the [[Vanir|Van]]". Prose below the quote clarifies that this is a reference to Ska<U+00F0>i's leaving of Nj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>r.<ref name=FAULKES75>Faulkes (1995:75).</ref> In chapter 16, names for Loki are given, including "wrangler of Heimdall and Skadi".<ref name=FAULKES77>Faulkes (1995:77).</ref> In chapter 22, Ska<U+00F0>i is referenced in the 10th century poem ''[[Haustl<U+00F6>ng]]'' where the skald [[<U+00DE>j<U+00F3><U+00F0><U+00F3>lfr of Hvinir]] refers to an [[ox]] as "bow-string-[[V<U+00E1>r|Var]]'s [Ska<U+00F0>i's] whale".<ref name=FAULKES87>Faulkes (1995:87).</ref> In chapter 23, the skald [[Bragi Boddason]] refers to <U+00DE>jazi as the "father of the ski-dis".<ref name=FAULKES89>Faulkes (1995:89).</ref> In chapter 32, Ska<U+00F0>i is listed among six goddesses who attend a party held by <U+00C6>gir.<ref name=FAULKES95>Faulkes (1995:95).</ref> In chapter 75, Ska<U+00F0>i is included among a list of 27 [[<U+00E1>synjur]] names.<ref name=FAULKES157>Faulkes (1995:157).</ref>

===''Heimskringla''===
In chapter 8 of the ''Heimskringla'' book ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'', Ska<U+00F0>i is described as having once married Nj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>r. Yet while they were together Ska<U+00F0>i would not have sex with Nj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>r, and that later Ska<U+00F0>i married Odin. Ska<U+00F0>i and Odin had  "many sons". Only one of the names of these sons is provided: [[S<U+00E6>mingr]], a king of [[Norway]]. Two stanzas are presented by the [[skald]] [[Eyvindr sk<U+00E1>ldaspillir]] in reference. In the first stanza, Ska<U+00F0>i is described as a j<U+00F6>tunn and a "fair maiden". A portion of the second stanza is missing. The second stanza reads:
<blockquote>
:. . .
:Of sea-bones,
:and sons many
:the ski-goddess
:gat with <U+00D3>thin<ref name=HOLLANDER12>Hollander (2007:12).</ref>
</blockquote>
Lee Hollander explains that "bones-of-the-sea" is a [[kenning]] for "rocks", and opines that this defective stanza undoubtedly referred to Ska<U+00F0>i as a "dweller of the rocks" in connection with her association with mountains and skiing.<ref name=HOLLANDER12/>

==Theories==
===''V<U+00F6>lsunga saga''===
Jesse Byock notes that there is another figure by the name of Ska<U+00F0>i who appears in the first chapter of ''[[V<U+00F6>lsunga saga]]''. In the chapter, this Ska<U+00F0>i<U+2014>who is male<U+2014>is the owner of a [[thrall]] by the name of [[Bre<U+00F0>i]]. Another man, [[Sigi]]<U+2014>a [[Sons of Odin|son of Odin]]<U+2014>went hunting one winter with the thrall Bre<U+00F0>i. Sigi and Bre<U+00F0>i hunted throughout the day until evening, when they compared their kills. Sigi saw that the thrall's kills outdid his own, and so Sigi killed Bre<U+00F0>i and buried Bre<U+00F0>i's corpse in a snowdrift.<ref name=BYOCK35>Byock (1990:35).</ref>

That night, Sigi returned home and claimed that Bre<U+00F0>i had ridden out into the forest, that he had lost sight of Bre<U+00F0>i, and that he furthermore did not know what became of the thrall. Ska<U+00F0>i doubted Sigi's explanation, suspected that Sigi was lying, and that Sigi had instead killed Bre<U+00F0>i. Ska<U+00F0>i gathered men together to look for Bre<U+00F0>i and the group eventually found the corpse of Bre<U+00F0>i in a [[snowdrift]]. Ska<U+00F0>i declared that henceforth the snowdrift should be called "Bre<U+00F0>i's drift," and ever since then people have referred to large snow drifts by that name. The fact that Sigi murdered Bre<U+00F0>i was evident, and so Sigi was considered an outlaw. Led by Odin, Sigi leaves the land, and Ska<U+00F0>i is not mentioned again in the saga.<ref name=BYOCK35/>

Byock notes that the goddess Ska<U+00F0>i is also associated with winter and hunting, and that the episode in ''Volsunga saga'' involving the male Ska<U+00F0>i, Sigi, and Bre<U+00F0>i has been theorized as stemming from an otherwise lost myth.<ref name=BYOCK111>Byock (1990:111).</ref>

===Other===
[[John Lindow]] comments that the episode in ''Gylfaginning'' detailing Loki's antics with a goat may have associations with castration and a ritual involving making a goddess laugh. Lindow notes that Loki and Ska<U+00F0>i appear to have had a special relationship, examplified by Ska<U+00F0>i's placement of the snake over Loki's face in ''Lokasenna'' and ''Gylfaginning.''<ref name=LINDOW268-270>Lindow (2001:268<U+2014>270).</ref>

Due to their shared association with skiing and the fact that both place names referring to Ullr and Ska<U+00F0>i appear most frequently in Sweden, some scholars have proposed a particular connection between the two gods.<ref name=LINDOW268-270/>

Modern works of art depicting Ska<U+00F0>i include ''Skadi und Niurd'' (illustration, 1883) by K. Ehrenberg and ''Skadi'' (1901) by E. Doepler d. J. Ska<U+00F0>i also appears in A.

E. John B. Allen notes that the deities are portrayed in a manner that "give[s] historical authority to this most important of Swedish ski journals, which began publication in 1893".<ref name=ALLEN2007>Allen (2007:16).</ref> A [[Moons of Saturn|moon of the planet Saturn]] ([[Skathi (moon)|Skathi]]) takes its name from that of the goddess.
