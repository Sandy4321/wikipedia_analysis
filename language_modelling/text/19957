'''''Courageous''''' is a [[Christian]] [[drama film]] produced by [[Sherwood Pictures]] and was released to theaters on September 30, 2011. It is the fourth film by Sherwood Pictures, the creators of ''[[Flywheel (film)|Flywheel]]'', ''[[Facing the Giants]]'', and ''[[Fireproof (film)|Fireproof]]''. Filming in [[Albany, Georgia]] concluded in June 2010. The film was marketed by Provident Films, which also marketed their previous films.

The film was directed by [[Alex Kendrick]], who co-wrote its screenplay with his brother [[Stephen Kendrick]]. Kendrick also stars in the film, along with [[Ken Bevel]], [[Kevin Downes]], and former running-back Tony Stallings. About half of the cast and crew were volunteers from [[Sherwood Baptist Church]], while the remainder were brought on through invitation-only auditions.

''Courageous'' opened well at the box office, grossing $2,000,000 in pre-sales and an estimated $3,100,000 opening day. Both numbers are significantly higher than its $1,000,000 budget. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics.

==Plot==
As law enforcement officers, Adam Mitchell, Nathan Hayes, David Thomson, and Shane Fuller are confident and focused. Yet at the end of the day, they face a challenge that none of them are truly prepared to tackle: fatherhood. While they consistently give their best on the job, good enough seems to be all they can muster as dads. They quickly discover that their standard is missing the mark.

When tragedy hits home, these men are left wrestling with their hopes, their fears, their faith, and their fathering. Protecting the streets is second nature to these men, but raising their children in a God-honoring way would truly be courageous.

=== Casting ===
In previous Sherwood Pictures films, almost all of the cast and crew were composed of members of [[Sherwood Baptist Church]], with [[Kirk Cameron]] being the notable exception with his lead role in ''Fireproof''. For ''Courageous'', however, the producers expanded their [[Casting (performing arts)|search for acting talent]]. Roughly half of the cast are volunteers from the church, but the other half were through invitation-only audition sessions. The lead roles in the film are played by [[Alex Kendrick]] and [[Ken Bevel]], both of whom have appeared in past Sherwood Pictures productions. [[Kevin Downes]], who has appeared in various other films, will play the role of Shane Fuller. Ben Davies, a student athlete at the [[University of Georgia]], will play the role of David Thomson. Tony Stallings, former [[running back]] and winner of [[Animal Planet]]'s ''[[King of the Jungle (TV series)|King of the Jungle]]'' reality show, is making his film debut.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.courier-journal.com/ericcrawford/2010/05/12/more-tony-stallings-part-1/ |title=More Tony Stallings, Part 1 |first=Eric |last=Crawford |date=May 12, 2010 |work=The Courier-Journal |accessdate=October 2, 2011}}</ref>

However, the actors are still volunteers. The film would have likely cost several times more if it had used professional assistance. Director Alex Kendrick said, "With volunteers no one is watching the clock and we're all in it together."<ref name="Time"/>

=== Filming ===
Filming of ''Courageous'' began on April 26, 2010 and concluded on June 25, 2010. The majority of the film was shot in [[Albany, Georgia|Albany]] and [[Dougherty County, Georgia]] area.

The Duggar daughters acted as extras in a funeral scene at [[Sherwood Baptist Church]] that involved several police officers in uniform.

In order to enhance the quality of the film, the production crew is using a new camera technology, "Red One", by the [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company]]. Kendrick estimated the production budget would exceed $1 million <U+2014> double that of ''Fireproof''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.albanyherald.com/news/2010/may/12/sherwood-pictures-takes-courageous-step-forward/ |title=Sherwood Pictures takes 'Courageous' step forward |last=Parks |first=Jennifer Maddox |date=May 13, 2010 |work=The Albany Herald |accessdate=May 13, 2010}} {{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref>

[[Tony Dungy]], a [[Super Bowl]]-winning football coach, mentioned the film in an article he wrote about fatherhood for ''[[USA Today]]''.
