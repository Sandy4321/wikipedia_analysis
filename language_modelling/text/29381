The [[Music of Atlanta|music scene of Atlanta]] is rich and varied, but hip hop is the only genre today in which Atlanta is a global leader. In 2009, the ''[[New York Times]]'' called Atlanta "hip-hop's center of gravity",<ref name=nyt>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/13/arts/music/13gucci.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=drumma%20boy&st=cse John Caramanica, "Gucci Mane, No Holds Barred ", ''New York Times'', December 11, 2009]</ref> and the city is home to many famous [[hip-hop]],  [[R&B]] and [[neo soul]]<ref>[http://m.npr.org/story/92090721?storyId=92090721 NPR: "Atlanta soul scene reborn"]</ref> musicians.

==History==
In the 1980s and early 1990s Atlanta's hip hop scene was characterized by a local variant of [[Miami bass|Miami's electro-driven bass music]], with stars like [[Kilo Ali]], MC Shy-D, Raheem the Dream and [[DJ Smurf]] (later [[Mr. Collipark]]).<ref name=nyt/> MC Shy-D is credited with bringing authentic Bronx-style hip-hop to Atlanta (and Miami), such as 1988's ''Shake it''<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=XkCncJ7j744C&lpg=PA476 Mickey Hess, ''Hip Hop in America: A Regional Guide: Volume 1: East Coast and West Coast'']</ref> produced by [[DJ Toomp]]; Jones was signed to controversial southern rap label [[Luke Records]], run by [[Luther Campbell]] aka "Uncle Luke". [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]] won the Grammy in 1992 with ''[[Tennessee]]'', while [[Mr. Wendal]] & [[People Everyday]] and [[Kris Kross]] won with their hit song [[Jump (Kris Kross song)|Jump]].

By the mid-1990s, the rise of [[LaFace Records]] artists [[OutKast]], [[Goodie Mob]] and the production collective [[Organized Noize]] led to the development of the [[Southern rap|Dirty South]] style of hip-hop and of Atlanta gaining a reputation for "soul-minded hip-hop eccentrics", contrasting with other regional styles.<ref name=nyt/> While Atlanta-area hip hop artists were from the [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur]] area, their prominence was eclipsed by music associated with these artists from "[[SWATS|The S.W.A.T.S.]]" ("Southwest Atlanta, too strong"),<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=kysEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA106 "Revolution Rock: Atlanta's Goodie Mob fight for truth, justice, but not necessarily the American Way", ''Vibe'', June-July 1998]</ref><ref name=gs>[http://www.youtube.com/user/SWATSATLTV S.W.A.T.S. Web television series YouTube channel]</ref> i.e. [[Southwest Atlanta]], plus territory extending into the adjacent cities of [[College Park, Georgia|College Park]] and [[East Point, Georgia|East Point]]. The term "SWATS" came into vogue around 1996, initially made popular by  OutKast and Goodie Mob.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=XkCncJ7j744C&pg=PA475 Mickey Hess, ''Hip Hop in America: East Coast and West Coast'']</ref>

From the late 1990s to early 2000s, producer [[Lil Jon]] was a driving force behind the party-oriented style known as [[crunk]]. [[Record Producers]] [[Antonio Reid|L.A. Reid]] and [[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds|Babyface]] founded [[LaFace Records]] in Atlanta in the late-1980s; the label eventually became the home to multi-platinum selling artists such as [[Toni Braxton]], [[TLC (music)|TLC]], [[Ciara]]. It is also the home of [[So So Def Records]], a label founded by Jermaine Dupri in the mid-1990s, that signed acts such as [[Da Brat]], [[Jagged Edge (band)|Jagged Edge]], [[Xscape (band)|Xscape]] and [[Dem Franchise Boyz]]. The success of LaFace and SoSo Def led to Atlanta as an established scene for record labels such as LaFace parent company [[Arista Records]] to set up satellite offices.

In 2009 the ''[[New York Times]]'' noted that after 2000, Atlanta moved "from the margins to becoming hip-hop's center of gravity, part of a larger shift in hip-hop innovation to the South." Atlanta hip-hop<U+2019>s pop breakthrough<U+2014>everyone from Jermaine Dupri to OutKast to Lil Jon<U+2014>involved the blend of various distillations of hard-core sounds from the West, bass beats from Florida, and styles and images from the North. <ref>{{cite book|last=Sarig|first=Roni|title=Third Coast: Outkast, Timbaland, & How Hip-Hop Became a Southern Thing|year=2007|publisher=Da Capo press|location=Cambridge, Masschusetts}}</ref> Producer [[Drumma Boy]] called Atlanta "the melting pot of the South". Producer [[Fatboi]] called the [[Roland TR-808]] ("808") synthesizer "central" to Atlanta music's versatility, used for [[snap music|snap]], [[crunk]], [[Trap (music genre)|trap]], and pop rap styles.<ref name=nyt/> The same article named [[Fatboi]], [[Shawty Redd]] and [[Zaytoven]] the four "hottest producers driving the city".<ref name=nyt/>

In 2013 funk legends The Bar-Kays and George Clinton named Atlanta hip hop trio EDUBB, as the protectors of funk and created an official remix with the group as their official cosign.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hip Hop|first=Weekly|title=[NEW MUSIC] EDUBB "What Goes N Da Club" Ft.
