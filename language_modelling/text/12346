[[Image:2+2.svg|thumb||right|200px|A well-known [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]] featuring the equals sign]]
The '''equals sign''' or '''equality sign''' ('''=''') is a [[mathematical symbol]] used to indicate [[equality (mathematics)|equality]]. It was invented in 1557 by [[Robert Recorde]]. The equals sign is placed between two quantities that have the same value, as in an [[equation]]. It is assigned to the [[Unicode]] and [[ASCII]] character 003D in [[hexadecimal]], 0061 in decimal.

==History==
The etymology of the word "equal" is from the Latin word "''aequalis"'' as meaning "uniform", "identical", or "equal", from ''aequus'' ("level", "even", or "just").

[[Image:Recorde - The Whetstone of Witte - equals.jpg|thumb|Recorde's introduction of "="]]

The "=" symbol that is now universally accepted by mathematics for equality was first recorded by Welsh mathematician [[Robert Recorde]] in ''The Whetstone of Witte'' (1557). The original form of the symbol was much wider than the present form. In his book Recorde explains his design of the "Gemowe lines" (meaning ''twin'' lines, from the [[Latin]] ''gemellus''):  
<blockquote>
''<U+2026> to auoide the tediou<U+017F>e repetition of the<U+017F>e woordes : is equalle to : I will <U+017F>ette as I doe often in woorke v<U+017F>e, a paire of paralleles, or Gemowe lines of one lengthe, thus: =, bicau<U+017F>e noe .2. thynges, can be moare equalle.'' 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<U+2026> to avoid the tedious repetition of these words: "is equal to", I will set (as I do often in work use) a pair of parallels, or Gemowe lines, of one length (thus =), because no two things can be more equal.
</blockquote>

According to Scotland's [[University of St Andrews]] History of Mathematics website:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Recorde.html | website = [[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]] | title = Robert Recorde | accessdate = 19 October 2013}}</ref>
<blockquote>The symbol '=' was not immediately popular. The symbol || was used by some and ''<U+00E6>'' (or ''<U+0153>''), from the Latin word ''aequalis'' meaning equal, was widely used into the 1700s.</blockquote>

==Usage in mathematics and computer programming==
In mathematics, the equals sign can be used as a simple statement of fact in a specific case (x&nbsp;=&nbsp;2), or to create definitions (let&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;2), conditional statements (if&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, then <U+2026>), or to express a universal equivalence <code>(x&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;x<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;2x&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</code>. 

The first important [[computer programming language]] to use the equals sign was the original version of [[Fortran]], FORTRAN&nbsp;I, designed in 1954 and implemented in 1957. In Fortran, "=" serves as an [[assignment (computer science)|assignment]] operator: <code>X&nbsp;=&nbsp;2</code> sets the value of <code>X</code> to 2. This somewhat resembles the use of "=" in a mathematical definition, but with different semantics: the expression following "=" is evaluated first and may refer to a previous value of <code>X</code>. For example, the assignment <code>X&nbsp;=&nbsp;X&nbsp;+&nbsp;2</code> increases the value of <code>X</code> by 2.

A rival programming-language usage was pioneered by the original version of [[ALGOL]], which was designed in 1958 and implemented in 1960. ALGOL included a [[relational operator]] that tested for equality, allowing constructions like <code>if&nbsp;x&nbsp;=&nbsp;2</code> with essentially the same meaning of "=" as the conditional usage in mathematics. The equals sign was reserved for this usage.

Both usages have remained common in different programming languages into the early 21st century. As well as Fortran, "=" is used for assignment in such languages as [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[awk]], and their descendants. But "=" is used for equality and not assignment in the [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] family, [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[APL (programming language)|APL]], and other languages.

A few languages, such as [[BASIC]] and [[PL/I]], have used the equals sign to mean both assignment and equality, distinguished by context. However, in most languages where "=" has one of these meanings, a different character or, more often, a sequence of characters is used for the other meaning. Following ALGOL, most languages that use "=" for equality use ":=" for assignment, although APL, with its special character set, uses a left-pointing arrow.

Fortran did not have an equality operator (it was only possible to compare an expression to zero, using the [[arithmetic IF]] statement) until FORTRAN&nbsp;IV was released in 1962, since when it has used the four characters ".EQ." to test for equality. The language [[B (programming language)|B]] introduced the use of "==" with this meaning, which has been copied by its descendant C and most later languages where "=" means assignment.

===Usage of several equals signs===
In [[PHP]], the [[===|triple equals sign (<code>===</code>)]] denotes identity,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php | title = Comparison Operators | website = PHP.net | accessdate = 19 October 2013}}</ref> meaning that not only do the two values evaluate to equal values, they are also of the same data type. For instance, the expression <code>0 == false</code> is true, but <code>0 === false</code> is not, because the number 0 is an integer value whereas false is a Boolean value.

[[JavaScript]] has the same semantics for <code>===</code>, referred to as "equality without type coercion". However in JavaScript the behavior of <code>==</code> cannot be described by any simple consistent rules. The expression <code>0 == false</code> is true, but <code>0 == undefined</code> is false, even though both sides of the <code>==</code> act the same in Boolean context. For this reason it is recommended to avoid the <code>==</code> operator in JavaScript in favor of <code>===</code>.<ref>{{cite web | author = Doug Crockford | title = JavaScript: The Good Parts | website = [[YouTube]] | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQVTIJBZook | accessdate = 19 October 2013}}</ref>

In Ruby, equality under <code>==</code> requires both operands to be of identical type, e.g. <code>0 == false</code> is false. The <code>===</code> operator is flexible and may be defined arbitrarily by any given type. For example, a value of type <code>Range</code> is a range of integers, such as <code>1800..1899</code>. <code>(1800..1899) == 1844</code> is false, since the types are different (Range vs. Integer); however <code>(1800..1899) === 1844</code> is true, since Range defines <code>===</code> to mean "inclusion in the range".<ref>{{cite web | title = [[why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby]] | section = 5.1 This One<U+2019>s For the Disenfranchised | author = [[why the lucky stiff]] | url = http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/chapter-5.html#section1 | accessdate = 19 October 2013}}</ref> Note that under these semantics, <code>===</code> is [[non-commutative]]; e.g. <code>1844 === (1800..1899)</code> is false, since it is interpreted to mean <code>Integer#===</code> rather than <code>Range#===</code>.<ref>{{cite web | author = Brett Rasmussen | title = Don't Call it Case Equality | date = 30 July 2009 | url = http://www.pmamediagroup.com/2009/07/dont-call-it-case-equality/ | accessdate = 19 October 2013}}</ref>

===Other uses===
The equals sign is also used in defining [[attribute<U+2013>value pair]]s, in which an [[Attribute (computing)|attribute]] is assigned a [[Value (computer science)|value]].{{ctn|date=June 2013}}

==Tone letter==
The equals sign is also used as a grammatical [[tone letter]] in the orthographies of [[Budu language|Budu]] in the [[Congo-Kinshasa]], in [[Krumen language|Krumen]], [[Mwan language|Mwan]] and [[Dan language|Dan]] in the [[Ivory Coast]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Peter G.

==Incorrect usage==
The equals sign is often used incorrectly within a mathematical argument to connect math steps in a non-standard way, rather than to show equality. For example, if one were finding the sum, step by step, of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, one might write
:1 + 2 = 3 + 3 = 6 + 4 = 10 + 5 = 15.
Structurally, this is shorthand for
:([(1 + 2 = 3) + 3 = 6] + 4 = 10) + 5 = 15,
but the notation is incorrect, because each part of the equality has a different value. If interpreted strictly as it says, it implies
:3 = 6 = 10 = 15 = 15.
A correct version of the argument would be
:1 + 2 = 3; 3 + 3 = 6; 6 + 4 = 10; 10 + 5 = 15.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://tamu.academia.edu/SencerCorlu/Papers/522225/Capraro_R._M._Capraro_M._M._Yetkiner_Z._E._Corlu_M._S._Ozel_S._Ye_S._and_Kim_H._G._2011_._An_international_perspective_between_problem_types_in_textbooks_and_students_understanding_of_relational_equality._Mediterranean_Journal_for_Research_in_Mathematics_Education_An_International_Journal_10_187-213 | title = An International Perspective between Problem Types in Textbooks and Students' understanding of relational equality | last = Capraro | first = Robert M. | last2 = Capraro | first2 = Mary Margaret | last3 = Yetkiner | first3 = Ebrar Z. | last4 = Corlu | first4 = Sencer M. | last5 = Ozel | first5 = Serkan | last6 = Ye | first6 = Sun | last7 = Kim | first7 = Hae Gyu | journal = Mediterranean Journal for Research in Mathematics Education | volume = 10 | number = 1<U+2013>2 | pages = 187<U+2013>213 | year = 2011 | accessdate = 19 October 2013}}</ref>
