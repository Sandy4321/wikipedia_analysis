Afterwards, he joined [[Jaguares de Chiapas|Jaguares]] of [[Mexico]] from Audax Italiano before the Mexican 2003 Apertura tournament.

He would lead the club in goals again in the 2004 Apertura, with eight in 16 matches.

Following the Clausura 2006 season in which Caba<U+00F1>as won his first goalscoring crown in the Mexican League, he attracted the attention of [[Club Am<U+00E9>rica]], one of the most important clubs in the country, and was signed by the [[Mexico City]] squad prior to the Apertura 2006 season.
