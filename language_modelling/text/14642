'''Pamela Jean "Pam" Barnes''' (formerly '''Haynes''' and '''Ewing''') is a [[fictional character]] and one of the female leads in the [[CBS]] primetime [[soap opera]] ''[[Dallas (TV series)|Dallas]]''. Pamela is portrayed by actress [[Victoria Principal]], and has appeared on the show since its [[List of Dallas episodes#Mini-series (April 1978)|pilot episode]], first broadcast on  April 2, 1978. ''Dallas'' follows the trials of the wealthy Ewing oil family in the town of [[Dallas, Texas]], of which Pam is married into.  Principal played Pam until the tenth season of ''Dallas'', where the character crashes into an oil tanker and her body is severely burned. After this, she is briefly played by actress [[Margaret Michaels]] in an attempt to write the character out.<ref name="IGN">{{cite web|author=Haque, Ashan (2008)|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/894/894682p1.html|title=Family Guy Flashback: "Da Boom" Review|accessdate=2010-08-31|work=IGN |publisher=News Corp.}}</ref> Pamela's storylines in the  [[List of Dallas episodes#Season One (1978-1979)|first season]] focus on her struggle with joining the Ewing family with hostility, while her love for husband [[Bobby Ewing]] ([[Patrick Duffy]]) remains a strong character trait throughout her tenure on the show. Principal also reunited with several former cast mates in the ''Dallas'' reunion special titled "''[[Dallas Reunion: The Return to Southfork]]''" that was televised in 2004.<ref name= "Return to Southfork">{{cite web|title= CBS Special: Return to Southfork |work= Ultimate Dallas.com |publisher = [[CBS]]|date=November 7, 2004|url= http://www.ultimatedallas.com/returntosouthfork/ }}</ref> 

In the early years of ''Dallas'', Principal took certain measures in her personal life in order to add depth to her character. She initially was very distant from the cast and they assumed she didn't like them. Serious producer [[Leonard Katzman]] confronted her about the issue and she said, "I like everybody. It's just that I want to feel like an outsider, like Pam Barnes does, being married to a Ewing."<ref name="Dallas: The Complete Story p-14">''Dallas: The Complete Story of the World's Favorite Prime-Time Soap'', pp. 14</ref> Principal also took to other ways of improving her character, such as taking voice lessons to perfect a Texas accent.<ref name="Dallas: The Complete Story p-14"/> Her relationship with Patrick Duffy's character, Bobby, has been the subject of critical acclaim. When Patrick Duffy returned to ''Dallas'' in 1985 after being absent for one season, the entire previous year had been written off as being Pam's dream.<ref name="Soap Staple"/> This storyline garnered a lot of publicity for the show, both good and bad. 

Principal received positive reviews for her portrayal of Pamela, and received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination in the category of "Best Actress in a Television Series" at the [[40th Golden Globe Awards]].<ref name = "THE 40TH ANNUAL GOLDEN GLOBE AWARDS (1983)"/> She was nominated for a ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' award for "Outstanding Actress in a Leading Role on a Prime Time Serial" in 1986, while also sharing a nomination with Patrick Duffy for "Favorite Super Couple: Prime Time" in 1988.<ref name="TV.com"/> However, the characters exit from the serial was met with notable controversy and hostility from the fans on the producers part. Hal Erickson of [[MSN]].com made it known that her exit was open ended and left the audience hanging.<ref name = "Dallas: Season 11"/> With the upcoming ''Dallas'' [[Dallas (2012 TV series)|continuation]] set to air in June 2012, rumors have been swirling that Principal could make a return to the show as Pam.<ref name= "Victoria Principal back in Dallas?">{{cite web|title= Actress Victoria Principal back in ''Dallas''? |work= Ultimate Dallas.com |publisher = [[CBS]]|date=November 18, 2011|url= http://www.ultimatedallas.com/dallasnews/2011/11/18/victoria-principal-back-in-dallas/  }}</ref>  

==Casting and creation==
===Background===
Before the creation of ''Dallas'', series creator  [[David Jacobs (writer)|David Jacobs]] originally had quite a different idea of what he envisioned the show to be. He wanted to create a television show based on "family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level".<ref name="Dallas: The Complete Story">''Dallas: The Complete Story of the World's Favorite Prime-Time Soap'', pp. 4<U+2013>5</ref> The Production Company, [[CBS]] , initially turned down his original idea, as they wanted something more "glitzy" to put on the air, with wealthier characters. After the success of ''Dallas'', Jacobs' initial idea would later become the ''Dallas'' spin-off [[Knots Landing]]. He initially conceived Pamela as the central character of the Texas based serial.<ref name="Dallas: The Complete Story"/> 

The role was initially created specifically for actress [[Linda Evans]] to star, and was indefinitely called "The Untitled Linda Evans Project" that was originally set in [[Indianapolis]]. He described her character as, "a terribly good-looking, semitrashy lady who marries into a rich Texas family".<ref name="Dallas: The Complete Story"/> After crafting the backstory of the Ewing family, Jacobs began to realize that the show couldn't be settled simply around the character of Pamela. He wanted it to be based around the entire clan and their lives as wealthy oil people living in Dallas, Texas. Evans was ultimately not offered the part, but would later go on to play [[Krystle Carrington]] on ''[[Dynasty (TV series)|Dynasty]]'', the rival show to ''Dallas''.<ref name="Dallas: The Complete Story p-6-7">''Dallas: The Complete Story of the World's Favorite Prime-Time Soap'', pp. 6<U+2013>7</ref><ref name="SOE">{{Cite book|last=Schemering |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Schemering |title=[[The Soap Opera Encyclopedia]] |date=September 1985|pages=80<U+2013>81 |isbn=0-345-32459-5 (1st edition)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title= The ''Dynasty'' That Could Have Been |publisher= State.com|work= Slate |date=May 25, 2011 |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2293600/ |accessdate=May 27, 2011 |first=Alex |last=Mar}}</ref> 

===Casting===   
After Jacobs decided that Evans would no longer play Pam, he began searching for another actress to play the character. The role was eventually won by then 28-year-old actress, Victoria Principal.<ref name="Dallas: The Complete Story p-8-9">''Dallas: The Complete Story of the World's Favorite Prime-Time Soap'', pp. 8<U+2013>9</ref> Principal won the role over another finalist, [[Judith Chapman]], who was known famously for her work in [[daytime television]]. Shortly after her role on ''Fantasy Island'', a friend of Principal's pointed her in the direction of ''Dallas'' and "a part in it that was written for you".<ref name="Dallas: The Complete Story p-8-9"/>  Eventually, Principal received a copy of the script "and read it and thought [my friend] was absolutely right". Acting as her own agent, she set up a meeting with the producers of ''Dallas''. Lee Rich, an executive producer in 1979, recounted: "We had all heard rumors about Victoria. This is a small town. Victoria's background, her so called past, was a plus. We felt that she had experienced life and could understand the part."<ref name="Dallas: The Complete Story p-8-9"/> Jacobs later said, "Victoria, of all the actors, went for the role the most aggressively. And that sort of determination just became part of the character." Prior to being cast in ''Dallas'', Principal had previously starred in a few small roles in movies and television specials.<ref name="Victoria Principal Credits">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/victoria-principal/credits/178320|title=Victoria Principal: Celebrity Credits|accessdate=March 10, 2012|work=[[TV Guide]]|publisher=United Video Satellite Group}}</ref> These works include ''[[Earthquake (film)]]'' in 1974, and her role on ''Fantasy Island'' in 1977.<ref name="Victoria Principal Credits"/>

[[Patrick Duffy]], who would play Pamela's on-screen love, knew the part was ideal for Principal the minute he set her eyes on her. He recalled that one of the finalists for Pamela "was a remarkably talented young actress from New York...[who was] really good. [Later], in walked Victoria Principal with the tightest jeans I've ever seen and the most unbelievable blouse. I just went, 'Hello, Pam'. I knew she was going to be Pam Ewing."<ref name="Dallas: The Complete Story p-8-9"/> Producer Michael Filerman ([[Knots Landing]], later [[Falcon Crest]]) offered insight, "Principal really wanted that role...and worked very hard to get it. And there's a humanity about her that's just winning. And the camera likes her very much. The camera just loves her. That's real important."<ref name="Dallas: The Complete Story p-8-9"/> During the pilot filming, Principal became very close with seventeen year old actress [[Charlene Tilton]], who played [[Lucy Ewing]]. Principal explained that "the location shooting was hard on Tilton, who was only seventeen and had never been away from home".<ref name="Dallas: The Complete Story p-13">''Dallas: The Complete Story of the World's Favorite Prime-Time Soap'', pp. 13</ref>

After appearing in ten of the fourteen season of ''Dallas'', Principal indicated that she wished to leave the serial to pursue other venues, and chose not to renew her contract with the show.<ref name= "Principal Leaving">{{cite web|title= Victoria Principal Leaving ''Dallas''|publisher= The Milwaukee Journal|date=January 29, 1987| location=United States}}</ref><ref name= "Victoria Principal Leaving ''Dallas''; Liz and George teaming for film">{{cite web|title= Victoria Principal Leaving ''Dallas''; Liz and George teaming for film |publisher= [[The Lakeland Ledger]]|date=January 30, 1987|location=United States}}</ref> [[Leonard Katzman]], who was the executive producer at the time, was now faced with the show losing one of its titular characters. Initially, Principal's departure was made out to be a simple "snag in contract negotiations".<ref name="Dallas: The Complete Story p-224">''Dallas: The Complete Story of the World's Favorite Prime-Time Soap'', pp. 224</ref> [[Lorimar]] also made notice that the departure was related to a "financial disagreement", even after Principal's agent gave notice that she was leaving. A show spokesperson commented, "We were unable to reach an agreement and now the producers are revision scripts without her...she turned down our last offer." [[The Milwaukee Journal]] noted that Principal was lined up for other venues at the time, included a project serial of her own.<ref name= "Principal Leaving"/> Actress [[Sheree J. Wilson]] stated that "Principal wanted [[Larry Hagman]]'s ([[J.R. Ewing]]) salary. But we were all paid a lot...and there was no more money. So, she knew that she was leaving."<ref name="Dallas: The Complete Story p-224"/> 
However, Principal rebuked such claims, saying: 
<blockquote>
"I've considered [leaving ''Dallas''] for a two years, and in the last six months, it's seemed real clear to me. I realized that my job would become my career if I stayed. Some people stay with a series until the end, you know, and afterwords they often have some problems, I think, finding new opportunities. And I wanted a career after ''Dallas''. There's great sadness in leaving my friends and the show - I was never bored with it - but I'm not at all ambivalent about this. I'm realistic about taking care of myself financially. I didn't want to walk away blindly without plans. My plans are set. I have a project with a network that is ready to go that I can't talk about yet. It's a drama mystery."<ref name="Dallas: The Complete Story p-224"/>  
</blockquote>

In 2010, [[TNT (TV channel)|TNT]] (sister company to [[Warner Bros. Television]] who are the current copyright owners of the series) announced they were producing [[Dallas (2012 TV series)|a new, updated series of ''Dallas'']].<ref name="People.com"/>  The new series is a continuation of the original series, and will primarily center around [[J.R.

==Character development==
===Lineage and personality===
[[File:Victoria Principal at the 39th Emmy Awards cropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Victoria Principal noted that Pamela evolved significantly as ''Dallas'' progressed.]]
The character of Pamela was a cornerstone for ''Dallas''; the [[lynchpin]] of the Barnes/Ewing family around which the soap was originally structured. At the beginning of the serial in 1978, Pamela was the newly married wife of [[Bobby Ewing]], the son of oil baron [[Jock Ewing]]. The fictional history of the character has been told via the serial, and the made for television movie ''[[Dallas: The Early Years]]'', which told the backstory of the Ewing family and the Barnes family.<ref name="Fandango Synopsis">{{cite web|url=http://www.fandango.com/dallas|title= ''Dallas'' (TV Series) Synopsis |accessdate=March 10, 2012|work=[[Fandango (ticket service)]]|publisher= [[Comcast]]}}</ref><ref name="RT">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dallas_the_early_years/|title=''Dallas: The Early Years'' - Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=March 10, 2012|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> ''Dallas: The Early Years'' told the background of the longstanding feud between Jock Ewing and Pamela's father, [[Willard Barnes|Willard "Digger" Barnes]], and how Pamela came to be raised.<ref name="RT"/> Later on in the serial, on Digger's deathbed, Pamela comes to find that he is not her biological father, but that her father is in fact Hutch McKinney, who had an affair with her mother Rebecca Barnes Wentworth while she was married to Digger.<ref name="Jock's Trial, Part II">{{cite episode|title= "Jock's Trial, Part II" (''Dallas'' Episode)|series=[[Dallas (TV series)|Dallas]]|credits= [[Irving J. Moore]](director), Arthur Bernard Lewis (writer)|network=[[CBS]]|airdate= February 29, 1980 (US) April 5, 1980 (UK)|season=2|number=52}}</ref>  

With Pamela being a member of the Barnes family, she was initially met with hostility from the rival Ewing family. Principal, who wanted to represent her characters outsider perception of the family, would portray this with the cast. Leonard Katzman described her as being "the world's most isolated lady". When confronted by Katzman about why Principal chose to be isolated from everyone else, he described the situation as: "After a while, I thought, 'Maybe she doesn't like us'. I went to see her. She said, 'No, I like everybody. It's just that I want to feel like an outsider, like Pam Barnes does, being married to a Ewing.'"<ref name="Dallas: The Complete Story p-14"/> Principal also took to other ways of improving her character, such as taking voice lessons to perfect a Texas accent.<ref name="Dallas: The Complete Story p-14"/> Fellow actor [[Patrick Duffy]] analyzed: 
<blockquote>
"She is enigmatic but I must tell you I never had a bad experience because of her enigma. What it was, she explained this once, is that she did this on purpose. The choice she made as an actress was, in playing the outsider in the Ewing family, she actually maintained somewhat of an outsider position with the cast as social equals. She didn't do a lot of the hanging out social activities that a lot of us did because we were together so much. So in that sense, she was maybe a few percentage points removed from the swirl that was the social center of our group. At least twice a year [[Larry Hagman]] and I would go up to Canada - fishing trips, hunting trips, things like that. [[Steve Kanaly]] was included in that group, and we would go up together, and Steve and I would take other trips together. We were a group, and [[Linda Gray]] was also a member of that group. Victoria was always slightly outside and didn't participate in those things. It was her own choice and she felt it was conducive to her playing the part of Pamela. But the times we were together on the set, waiting for scenes to be shot, in the make-up room and everything, it was nothing but convivial."<ref name="UD">{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatedallas.com/dallasinterviews/ |title=Exclusive Interview with ''Dallas'' actor [[Patrick Duffy]]|accessdate=March 10, 2012|work=Ultimate Dallas|publisher = [[CBS]]}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Victoria Principal has said that she feels Pam changed throughout the course of the series. She commented, "Pam didn<U+2019>t have two parents, her father was a [[drunkard]], and she really had to fight for everything she aspired too and achieved. When Bobby married her, he wasn<U+2019>t marrying milk toast; she was very, very spirited; she was always a good person. I always felt Pam was the moral centre of the programme but she was complicated, and she was fiery, she had opinions, and she was not afraid to voice them. But as the years went by, as JR became more and more evil, the writers felt, and I certainly understand why for the benefit of the show, that Pam had to become more and more good."<ref name="VPINT">{{cite web|url= http://www.ultimatedallas.com/victoriaprincipal/ |title=Official ''Dallas'' Website : Exclusive Interview with [[Victoria Principal]]|accessdate=March 11, 2012|work=Ultimate Dallas.com|publisher= [[CBS]]}}</ref> When asked about whether she had any input on her characters growth, she said: "Once the show achieved extraordinary world wide fame, I don<U+2019>t think any of us had much input.  You know the old saying, if its not broken, don<U+2019>t fix it; I really believe that [[Lorimar Television]] looked upon it as something that was working and they did not want to deviate from the formula."<ref name="VPINT"/>

===Relationships===
[[File:Pam clutches Bobby's dead body.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Pam (Victoria Principal) clutches Bobby's dead body after being struck by a car.]]
Pamela's marriage to [[Bobby Ewing]] is central to understanding her character. The couple produced the opening scene of ''Dallas'' when the show first aired in 1978, with Bobby bringing his new bride home to meet [[Jock Ewing|Jock]] and [[Miss Ellie Ewing]].<ref name="Duffy Leaving"/>  Their complex relationship has often been compared to that of Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. When asked about whether or not series creator David Jacobs had this parallel relationship in mind from the start, he said: "Yes, guilty (laughs)".<ref name="DJINT">{{cite web|url=  http://www.ultimatedallas.com/backstage/behind8.htm  |title=Official ''Dallas'' Website : Exclusive Interview with David Jacobs|accessdate=March 11, 2012|work=Ultimate Dallas.com|publisher= [[CBS]]}}</ref> Relations can be made from [[William Shakespeare]]'s two feuding families in Romeo and Juliet, the [[Montagues]] and the [[Capulets]]. These families represent the Barnes and the Ewing feuding families, with Pamela being portrayed as [[Juliet Capulet]] and Bobby as [[Romeo Montague]].<ref name="DJINT"/> According to Patrick Duffy, being immediately paired off with Principal was a challenge. He said, "We were in a constant state of competition. We were very territorial in front of the camera, and it was a strain."<ref name="Duffy Leaving">{{cite web|url= http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20090672,00.html|title= Patrick Duffy Bids Bye-Bye to Bobby in the Hottest Dallas Cliff-Hanger Since J.R.

Some of the best scenes on the show were between Victoria and me, and they happened after we got comfortable with each other."<ref name="Duffy Leaving"/>

Pamela and Bobby's relationship changed significantly as the show went on and began to progress. In order to create conflict, the producers brought in actors [[Priscilla Presley]] ([[Jenna Wade]]) and John Beck (Mark Graison) to cause drama for the couple.<ref name="JBINT"/> Eventually, the two characters divorced one another and went their separate ways. After becoming involved with Ewing oil, Bobby tended to put Pam on the backburner with the company coming first. In an interview with ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', Principal said: "I wouldn't put up with the way Pam is treated by Bobby."<ref name="Dallas Darling">{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20078929,00.html |title= The Dallas Good Girl, Victoria Principal, with the Party Girl Past, Regrets Nothing|date=March 30, 1981 |accessdate=March 15, 2012|author= David Gritten|work=[[People (magazine)]]|publisher=[[Time Warner]]}}</ref> She also added, "Our marriage just doesn't work anymore and I want a divorce."<ref name="Dallas Darling"/> With the impending couple doomed, Pamela began a newfound relationship with Mark Graison (played by [[John Beck (actor)|John Beck]]). The producers of ''Dallas'' were faced with the obstacle of getting the audience to root for a new love interest in Pam's life. When asked about the reception of his characters relationship with Pamela, Beck commented: "It was always set up that way from the beginning , so it was quite a task and of course they came back together in the long run. I was just hoping for the best. I never got an extraordinary reaction from the public but it was everywhere, so constant recognition. It was pretty amazing but I never saw it the way he sees it but I can see his point of view. I never really looked at it like that."<ref name="JBINT">{{cite web|url= http://www.ultimatedallas.com/interviews/john.htm |title=Official ''Dallas'' Website : Exclusive Interview with actor John Beck|accessdate=March 11, 2012|work=Ultimate Dallas.com|publisher= [[CBS]]}}</ref> 

In 1985, Patrick Duffy announced his intentions to leave the show which left Pamela and Bobby permanently disconnected from each other. When Duffy initially left ''Dallas'' in 1985, it was assumed that Pamela and Bobby's relationship had finally ended after a brief reconciliation during that season. However, the actor returned to the show the following season after the ratings began to fall.<ref name="Soap Staple"/> [[Leonard Katzman]] said, "Without Bobby we lost the white knight to J.R. and the Romeo to Victoria Principal's Juliet.

After her miscarriage, much of the hostility from the family evaporates, with the exception of J.R. He openly despises both her and her brother. In 1979, Pam is told by Digger's doctor that Digger was a carrier of [[neurofibromatosis]], and that she and Cliff, as his children, were carriers; as neurofibromatosis is a disease that could be fatal to infants, the doctor strongly advises them never to have children.<ref name="The Silent Killer">{{cite episode|title= "The Silent Killer" (''Dallas'' Episode)|series=[[Dallas (TV series)|Dallas]]|credits=Irving J.

But she certainly looks good enough to return to the fold to play opposite [[Jesse Metcalfe]], 33 , who plays her grown up son Christopher."<ref name = "TDM">{{cite news|title= As Dallas gets a reboot, original cast member Victoria Principal, 61 , proves that some classics really don't get old...|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2078562/Dallas-star-Victoria-Principal-61--looks-youthful-Malibu.html  |work = [[The Daily Mail]]|publisher= [[Associated Newspapers]]|author= Amelia Proud|date=December 26, 2011|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}</ref> 

Pamela crashed into an oil tanker at the end of the tenth season of ''Dallas''. The exit storyline was the subject of notable controversy. It was left open ended after Principal left the show and the audience had no idea where the character was going. Hal Erickson of [[MSN]].com said, "Although Victoria Principal had left ''Dallas'' at the end of season ten, by the time the series' 11th season rolled around, Principal's character, Pamela Ewing, was still lingering about, swathed in bandages after being seriously injured in a car accident. As if to lead viewers to the conclusion that Pamela would suddenly make a complete recovery in the tradition of her husband Bobby Ewing's (Patrick Duffy) "return from the dead" at the outset of season ten, the ultimate fate of Pamela was left unresolved for several weeks --and further complicated when the poor girl suddenly vanished from her hospital bed."<ref name = "Dallas: Season 11">{{cite news|title=Dallas: Season 11: Synopsis|url= http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie-synopsis/dallas-season-11/  |work = [[MSN]]|publisher= [[Microsoft]]|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}</ref>

Patrick Duffy returned to ''Dallas'' in 1986 after being after for an entire season. The whole years worth of episodes was written off entirely as Pam's dream. The storyline garnered the show a lot of publicity, both good and bad. The Staff of [[UGO Networks]].com said: "[[soap opera|Soap Operas]] are known (and at times hated) for their ridiculously implausible storylines, and while '80s primetime suddser ''Dallas'' is still one of our favorite guilty pleasures, even the great Ewing empire is not immune to the absurd storytelling techniques the genre has become associated with. While your average primetime soap operas don't usually mingle with the stuff of sci-fi and horror, there's an incredibly high rate of characters returning from the dead in the genre. Case in point: Bobby Ewing. Presumed dead after being run over by his sister-in-law, [[Katherine Wentworth]], who also happened to be obsessed with him, fans (and [[CBS]]) had to do without Patrick Duffy, and even worse, ratings, for one whole season. Thus, [[Larry Hagman]] who played Duffy's onscreen brother and despised oil baron, [[J.R. Ewing]], along with network execs pursuaded Duffy to return, making it possible (we're talking in soap opera terms here), for Bobby Ewing's character to come back by writing off the ratings nightmare of a season as a dream... a very bad one."<ref name="Soap Staple"/>
