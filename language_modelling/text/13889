The '''2009 Malagasy political crisis''' involved a series of anti-government demonstrations in [[Madagascar]] in early 2009, culminating in military involvement and the accession of opposition leader [[Andry Rajoelina]] to the Presidency. The protests began in January 2009 and were aimed at the government of [[President of Madagascar|President]] [[Marc Ravalomanana]].<ref name=france24>{{cite news|first=Catherine|last=Norris Trent|title=Antananarivo almost a ghost town after protests|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20090129-capital-becomes-ghost-town-after-protests-madagascar-mayor|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|publisher=[[France 24]]|date=29 January 2009|accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref> The protests, which turned violent, were organized and spearheaded by Rajoelina, who was the mayor of the capital city of [[Antananarivo]] and a prominent opponent of President Ravalomanana.<ref name=france24/><ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hfV75EHUookBtBk2OlprGZBpDTzgD9607AL04|title = 43 killed in Madagascar political violence|agency = [[Associated Press]] |work=[[Google News]] |date = 28 January 2009}}{{dead link|date=July 2009}}</ref> At least 130 people were killed in Madagascar during the crisis.

The protests were seen as the gravest challenge faced by the Ravalomanana government since he came to office in 2002.<ref name=france24/> President Ravalomanana vowed to restore order "whatever the cost", according to a government statement,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/01/28/madagascar.violence.riots/index.html|title=Calm in Madagascar after violence leaves 34 dead|date=28 January 2009|accessdate=2009-01-30|work=[[CNN]]}}</ref> while opposition leader Rajoelina called for the dissolution of the government and the formation of a transitional government under his leadership.

On 16 March 2009, one of the palaces of President Ravalomanana, the [[Ambohitsorohitra Palace]], was stormed and taken by soldiers of the Malagasy Army. The president was not in the stormed palace at the time. The [[African Union]] condemned the action, calling it an "attempted [[coup d'etat]]". Rajoelina insisted that the palace seizure was not a coup,<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7947381.stm |title=Pressure grows on Madagascar head |date=17 March 2009 |work=[[BBC]] |accessdate=2009-03-18}}</ref> although he immediately installed himself in the presidential offices of the captured palace.

Ravalomanana had already moved out of the Iavoloha palace to an undisclosed location. The military junta, consisting of senior military personnel, would have been charged with organizing elections within 24 months and re-writing the constitution for the "Fourth Republic".<ref name="lough1">{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/17/AR2009031700358.html |title=Madagascar's president steps down |last=Lough |first=Richard |date=March 17, 2009 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=2009-03-18}}{{dead link|date=July 2009}}</ref> However, Vice Admiral Ramaroson announced on 18 March that it would transfer power directly to Rajoelina, making him president of the opposition-dominated [[High Transitional Authority (Madagascar)|High Transitional Authority]] that he had appointed weeks earlier.<ref name=bbc-2009-03-18>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7949596.stm |title=Military backs Madagascar rival |date=17 March 2009 |work=[[BBC]] |accessdate=2009-03-18}}</ref> Madagascar's constitutional court deemed the transfer of power, from Ravalomanana to the military board and then to Rajoelina, to be legal.<ref name=aj-2009-03-19>{{cite news |title=Madagascar dissolves parliament |work=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=19 March 2009 |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2009/03/2009319155324395613.html |accessdate=2009-07-14 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5iejizW0Q|archivedate=2009-07-30|deadurl=no}}</ref> 

According to Rajoelina's Prime Minister [[Monja Roindefo]], the transfer of power was not a ''coup d'<U+00E9>tat'' but instead "the direct expression of democracy, when representative democracy does not express itself through the institutions". Rajoelina was officially sworn in on 21 March before a crowd of 40,000 supporters.<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gtr-r6sogpcE4wVoqsh3bNR2rHtw "Madagascar's Rajoelina sworn in"], AFP, 21 March 2009.</ref>

Andry Rajoelina has been a vocal opponent of the Ravalomanana government since he was elected [[Mayor of Antananarivo]] in December 2007.<ref name=france24/>

The relationship between Rajoelina and the Malagasy government further deteriorated on December 13, 2008,<ref name=cpj>{{cite news|title= Anti-government protests burn two TV stations|url=http://cpj.org/2009/01/two-tv-stations-burned-in-anti-government-protests.php|work=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]]|date=26 January 2008|accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref> after the government shut down a television station owned by Rajoelina.<ref name=france24/> Rajoelina's television station was shuttered for airing an interview with exiled former President [[Didier Ratsiraka]].<ref name=france24/>

On Monday, January 26, 2009, the protests turned increasingly violent.<ref name=france24/> Demonstrators set fire to the Madagascar state-owned radio building, attacked a private television station owned by Ravalomanana and looted shops and businesses throughout the city.<ref name=france24/>

At 3 a.m. on January 26, 2009, armed government [[security agent]]s reportedly disabled the transmitter of Viva Radio, a private radio station owned by Rajoelina.<ref name=cpj/>

Protesters ransacked two pro-government television stations in Antananarivo. Thousands of protesters raided and looted the headquarters of the [[Radio Nationale Malgache]] and [[T<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>vision Nationale Malgache]] building around 1 p.m. local time on January 26, 2009.<ref name=cpj /> About an hour later demonstrators  burned down the [[Malagasy Broadcasting System]], a private station owned by President Ravalomanana.<ref name=cpj/> A policeman and a 14-year old protester were reportedly killed in the clashes at the Malagasy Broadcasting System attacks.<ref name=cpj/>

Firefighters found the bodies of at least 25 people in the ruins of a burned out, looted [[department store]] in downtown Antananarivo.<ref>{{cite news |title=Madagascar deaths rise to 44, shops heed strike |work=[[Reuters]] |date=29 January 2009 |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE50S1Z220090129?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews&rpc=22&sp=true |accessdate=2009-07-14 }}</ref><ref name=france24two>{{cite news|first=Catherine|last=Norris Trent|title= Charred bodies found in wake of violent protests |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20090127-dozens-charred-bodies-found-looted-store-madagascar-protests |agency=[[Reuters]] |work=[[France 24]]|date=27 January 2009 |accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref> The bodies were thought to be those of looters who became trapped in the burning shop when the roof caved in.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7852933.stm |title=Burned bodies found in Madagascar |date=27 January 2009 |accessdate=2009-01-30 |work=[[BBC]]}}</ref> In total, 44 people died. Their bodies were taken to a morgue, and all but ten of them were found to be severely burned. 

In a show of defiance against the government, Rajoelina called for all Antananarivo residents to stay home on 29 January 2009.<ref name=france24/> This "ghost town" (''ville morte'') protest basically closed all stores and businesses in the capital city.<ref name=bbcnews>{{cite news|first=Christina|last=Corbett|title= Life on hold in Madagascar|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7858024.stm |work=[[BBC]]|date=29 January 2009|accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref>

The [[Roman Catholic]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[emeritus]] of Antananarivo [[Armand Razafindratandra]] appealed for calm as the protests spread outside of the capital.<ref name=cna>{{cite news|title= Rebellion in Madagascar spreads from the capital|url=http://catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=14945|work=[[Catholic News Agency]]|date=31 January 2009 |accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> All state and private radio stations in the country reportedly ceased broadcasting, with the exception of [[Radio Don Bosco]], which is run by the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian]] [[religious order]].<ref name=cna/>

Rajoelina said on 31 January that he was taking control of the country due to the failure of Ravalomanana and the government to fulfill their responsibilities.<ref name=bbcnews2>{{cite news |title= Mayor 'in charge' of Madagascar|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7862495.stm |work=[[BBC]]|date=31 January 2009 |accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref> He said that a request for Ravalomanana's "immediate resignation" would be submitted to [[Parliament of Madagascar|Parliament]] "in order to comply with the legal procedure". Furthermore, he asked that the [[central bank]] withhold money from the government, that all government ministries close, and that the security forces join him. Rajoelina said that he wanted the constitution to be respected and that it was Ravalomanana who had violated the constitution. According to Rajoelina, a new [[transitional government]] would soon be appointed under his leadership and a new presidential election would be held within two years. Speaking on the same day, Ravalomanana stated that he was "still the president of this country" and that he would "do what is necessary to develop this nation".<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i0yEecp38iUgFpFcn-1ibwMFNvNA|title = Madagascar mayor proclaims himself in charge of country |agency = [[Agence France-Presse]] |date = 31 January 2009 |accessdate = 2009-07-14}}</ref>

The [[African Union]] (AU) immediately warned Rajoelina that it would not accept an unconstitutional power grab in Madagascar: "It's totally forbidden to take power by non-constitutional means."<ref name=reuters2>{{cite news |first=Barry |last=Malone |title=African Union warns Madagascar opposition leader |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/rbssIndustryMaterialsUtilitiesNews/idUKL104503420090201 |work=[[Reuters]] |date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref>

Opposition leaders allied to Rajoelina filed a petition with the High Constitutional Court on February 2, asking it to remove Ravalomanana from office. By that point, attendance at Rajoelina's rallies had reportedly decreased.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jHjE_NP_SnyCkVBGnIdnRC_huIIQ |title = Madagascar mayor pushes for president's ouster |agency = [[Agence France-Presse]] |work=[[Google News]] |date = 2 February 2009}}</ref> On 3 February, Rajoelina said at a rally that he would announce his new government on 7 February.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hp7hCWiQNCeRRsYH0_KTsHjKTbNA |title = Madagascar mayor to announce govt Saturday |agency = [[Agence France-Presse]] |work=[[Google News]] |date = 3 February 2009}}</ref> On the same day, the High Constitutional Court ruled that it had no power to remove the President from office, as that power belonged to Parliament.<ref name=Fired>{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7867512.stm |title = Madagascar opposition mayor fired |publisher = [[BBC]] |date = 3 February 2009 |accessdate = 2009-07-14}}</ref> Also on 3 February, Rajoelina was dismissed as Mayor and a special delegation, headed by [[Guy Randrianarisoa]], was appointed instead.

Rajoelina held another rally on February 4, with about 1,500 people in attendance. On that occasion he described the appointment of Randrianarisoa as "an insult to the people of Madagascar"; he instead designated [[Michele Ratsivalaka]] to succeed him as Mayor and gave her his mayoral scarf.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ifdczZtXnRO9VQb3h7Xm5hDhdxeA|title = Hundreds protest Madagascar mayor's sacking |agency = [[Agence France-Presse]] |work=[[Google News]] |date = 4 February 2009}}</ref>

The National Police warned that the death toll could rise, as many of the wounded were in critical condition. The following day it was reported that the death toll had increased to at least 50, with doctors estimating that 180 people had arrived at the city's main [[Ravoahangy Andrianavalona Hospital]].<ref name="Madagascar protesters shot dead">{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2009/02/200927132745370579.html |title=Madagascar protesters shot dead |date=8 February 2009 |accessdate=2009-02-08 |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]}}</ref> Antananarivo journalist [[Fanja Saholiarisoa]] said: "The mortuary is full and the hospital is full.

Also on 7 February, Rajoelina said that [[Roindefo Monja]] would be Prime Minister under his transitional authority. According to Rajoelina, each of Madagascar's regions would have representation in the transitional authority. Regarding Ambohitsorohitra Palace, Rajoelina alluded to its history as a mayoral residence prior to 2002 and said that it "belongs to the people and to the city", while declaring that he had decided to give the palace to Monja for his use as Prime Minister. On the same day, Ravalomanana urged "calm and order", accusing Rajoelina of "cross[ing] all limits", while Prime Minister [[Charles Rabemananjara]] announced a one-week extension of the curfew.<ref name=Three/>

While visiting hospitalized victims of the shooting on 8 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue his struggle and argued that Ravalomanana's answer to the popular call for change was gunfire. He called for a national day of mourning on 9 February.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hgz9lBNiiX1hOyez5QZ6Jt4dU_Yg|title = Madagascar opposition chief vows to fight on |agency = [[Agence France-Presse]] |work=[[Google News]] |date = 8 February 2009}}</ref>

The 7 February shooting was thought to have reversed the opposition's declining momentum. Newspapers published on 9 February, strongly denounced the shooting.<ref name=Defence/> On 10 February, speaking before a rally of about 5,000 supporters, Rajoelina urged the people to observe a general strike on the next day; he asked that everyone stay indoors and that no one go to work or attend school. Roindefo announced the appointment of four ministers to serve in his transitional government, and he said that the remainder of them would be appointed by the end of the week. Meanwhile, both Ravalomanana and Rajoelina accepted dialogue in principle; Rajoelina said that dialogue would be conditional on the holding of a new presidential election or the formation of a transitional government.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hX9i5M7spInGV7yoHJStORvfsnRQ |title = Madagascar rebel appoints 'ministers,' calls strike |agency = [[Agence France-Presse]] |work=[[Google News]] |date = 10 February 2009}}</ref>

At a 35,000-strong rally in Antananarivo on 14 February, Ravalomanana said that he would serve out his full term as President, that he was listening to the people, and that he regretted the deaths that had occurred during the protests. On the same day, Rajoelina held a rally nearby, with about 10,000 in attendance.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hIKYZ10OCHcJYd0x1Ry2NLZyQofg |title = I'm here to stay, Madagascar president vows |agency = [[Agence France-Presse]] |work=[[Google News]] |date = 14 February 2009}}</ref>

At a rally on 17 February, Rajoelina vowed to continue the struggle, and later in the day several thousand of his supporters engaged in [[sit-in]]s near key ministries. Representing the government, Defense Minister Ranaivoniarivo invited Roindefo to participate in talks.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i8N4JJGHdVRygzS9lJUA6QCMNo9g |title = Thousands stage sit-in in Madagascar capital |agency = [[Agence France-Presse]] |work=[[Google News]] |date = 17 February 2009}}</ref> Rajoelina's supporters took over several important ministries on 19 February, changing the locks and installing Rajoelina's own ministers to work in them. Meanwhile, Ravalomanana appointed a new Minister of the Interior, [[Rabenja Sehenoarisoa]] (who had previously served as chief of police in the capital). His predecessor as Interior Minister, [[Gervais Rakotonirina]], was said to have departed the government due to poor health.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iCHR7cFKevuVdHMgdVL57F94pfcg|title = Madagascar's president names new interior minister |agency = [[Agence France-Presse]] |work=[[Google News]] |date = 19 February 2009}}</ref> Only hours after the opposition took over the government ministries, they were removed from the ministries by security forces early on February 20; about 50 of Rajoelina's supporters were arrested.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=87&art_id=nw20090220095321275C489961 |title = Madagascan forces retake ministries |agency = [[Reuters]] |work=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|Independent Online]] |date = 20 February 2009}}</ref>

Ravalomanana and Rajoelina met on 21 February; this meeting, which lasted about 45 minutes, was organized by the [[Council of Christian Churches in Madagascar]].

This was intended as a prelude to more comprehensive dialogue.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i42kg-y4xxcryRecYKK0xAD4RRyw |title = Madagascar rivals meet in bid to calm unrest |agency = [[Agence France-Presse]] |work=[[Google News]] |date = 21 February 2009}}</ref> On 23 February the two met again for about an hour,<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jUCqqW6qNxQ9Z9Vig99KWHVd7GEQ|title = Madagascar rivals meet for further negotiations|agency = [[Agence France-Presse]] |work=[[Google News]] |date = 23 February 2009}}</ref> and they held a third meeting, also lasting an hour, on 24 February.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jeYlp_Ixo_bT8v0UlM9qbofpMG1A|title = Madagascar power rivals pursue negotiations|agency = [[Agence France-Presse]] |work=[[Google News]] |date = 25 February 2009}}</ref> However, Ravalomanana failed to appear for a planned meeting on February 25, and Rajoelina then announced that he was withdrawing from the talks. Rajoelina criticized Ravalomanana for his absence and furthermore stated that the meetings he had held with Ravalomanana prior to that were disappointing. [[Odon Razanakolona]], who had been mediating the talks, abandoned his role shortly before Rajoelina withdrew from the talks; according to Razanakolona, the talks were fruitless and deadlocked.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jcThbLG2sMRLPNqLui7PNU6IxI3g|title = Madagascar opposition leader breaks off talks with president |agency = [[Agence France-Presse]] |work=[[Google News]] |date = 25 February 2009}}</ref>

A protest in [[Ambositra]] was broken up by police on 4 March, and two people were killed. Also on 4 March, President Ravalomanana declared his intention to "restore order" on [[Radio Mada]].

The security forces unsuccessfully attempted to arrest Rajoelina at his compound late on 5 March; they also raided his Viva media network.

===Mediation crisis talks===
Former exiled president of Madagascar [[Marc Ravalomanana]], [[President of Madagascar|President of the High Authority of Transition of Madagascar]] [[Andry Rajoelina]], former exiled Madagascar president [[Didier Ratsiraka]] and former president of the Malagasy Republic [[Albert Zafy]] are meeting beginning Tuesday August 4, 2009 in [[Madagascar]] for four day long mediation crisis talks with the former Mozambican President [[Joaquim Chissano]] acting as mediator.  Representatives from the [[African Union]] (AU), [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]] and the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC).  The mediation talks hope to arrive at a way for Ravalomanana to return to Madagascar from his exile in South Africa. The talks are also a trade meeting to begin negotiations on the transition charter to seek new elections in Madagascar. Ratsiraka who has been exiled in France has seen his amnesty issue resolved at the talks. The four leaders seek to again become a customs union (SADC), and representatives of the United Nations.<ref>{{Cite news

Since 16 March, [[Norway]] has instituted sanctions, mostly consisting of a freeze of economic aid, primarily due to the unstable atmosphere in the country prior to the resignation of Ravalomanana, and it has retained such sanctions for the time being.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE52I2T220090319 |title=Norway says Madagascar aid freeze in force |first=Richard |last=Lough |work=[[Reuters]] |agency=|date=19 March 2009 }}</ref>

On 20 March, [[State Department of the United States|U.S. State Department]] spokesman Robert Wood said the United States will suspend all non-humanitarian assistance to Madagascar.<ref name=gn-2009-03-20/>

The African Union suspended Madagascar's membership in the organization.

US President Barack Obama decided to remove Madagascar from the beneficiary of the AGOA [[African Growth and Opportunity Act]]. On December 23 of the year 2009, President Obama officially also terminated the program for Guinea and Niger along with Madagascar all for undemocratic change of power <ref>Presidential Proclamation - To Take Certain Actions Under the African Growth and Opportunity Act</ref>. The AGOA program has helped created ten of thousands of jobs for middle class Malagasy especially in apparel manufacturing factories, it is feared that most of these jobs will be lost in the near future. Considering the important number of business affected by this decision, the economy of the capital city Antananarivo and [[Antsirabe]] will be deeply affected fearing further social tension.

=== Government response ===
Most of the government response has been channeled through opposition prime minister [[Monja Roindefo]], who denied that the events leading to Rajoelina's gaining of the presidency was a coup, but rather a "direct expression of democracy, when representative democracy does not express itself through the institutions",<ref name=tg-2009-03-20>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/20/african-union-suspends-madagascar |title=African Union suspends Madagascar over 'coup' |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 March 2009 |first=Chris |last=McGreal | location=London}}</ref> and called on the European Union to reconsider its reaction to the events. Rajoelina dismissed the condemnations, stating that "if they haven't understood the process, they may well react. But if they stick to their line after we have spoken, it will be annoying".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=68&art_id=nw20090320120610231C979215 |title=PM rejects coup claims |work=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|Independent Online]] |agency=[[South African Press Association]]; [[Agence France-Presse]] |date=20 March 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-14 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5iejt2atr|archivedate=2009-07-30|deadurl=no}}</ref> 

Rajoelina has promised that the high [[cost of living]] would decrease because merchants had agreed to decrease the price of bread and cooking oil as of 30 March, and the cost of rice soon thereafter.<ref name=ap-28-03-2009/>

In response to the [[Southern African Development Community]]'s view that Rajoelina's rise to power was unconstitutional and its urging for elections within six months, Rajoelina said that membership in the SADC is "not in the interests of Madagascar".<ref name=r-30-03-2009/> He said he would confer with others to decide whether Madagascar would continue to be a member of the SADC.<ref name=r-30-03-2009/> "The prospect of an SADC intervention is unacceptable. Other states cannot interfere with the decision of (Madagascar's) High Constitutional Court" that the transfer of power to Rajoelina was constitutional.<ref name=r-30-03-2009/>
