The '''Bergen County Academies''' (sometimes referred to as '''Bergen Academy''' or '''BCA''') is a [[Magnet school|magnet]] [[public high school]] located in [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] that serves the high-school population of [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]], [[New Jersey]].<ref name = "BCAwelcome">[http://bcts.bergen.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=79&Itemid=1353 Welcome to Bergen County Academies], Bergen County Academies. Accessed [[July 16]], [[2007]].</ref> The school was originally the brainchild of the late Dr. John Grieco. The current principal is Daniel Jaye; the vice principal is Russell Davis. Dr. Raymond Bath is the Academic Dean; Dr. David Ostfeld is Admissions Chair. <ref name=Admin/>

As of the 2005-06 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,104 students and 95.8 classroom teachers (on an [[full-time equivalent|FTE]] basis), for a student-teacher ratio of 11.5.<ref name=NCES>[http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/school_detail.asp?Search=1&DistrictID=3401470&ID=340147000250 Bergen Academies Hackensack], [[National Center for Education Statistics]]. Accessed [[May 4]], [[2008]].</ref>

==House and grounds==
[[Image:BergenCA.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Bergen County Academies Auditorium entrance]]
The Bergen County Academies is located on the John Grieco Campus of the [[Bergen County Technical Schools]] District in Hackensack, NJ. In addition to the main three-floor building, the Environmental Science Center (ESC) is used for academic purposes. A two-floor addition has recently been built and has opened on April 8, 2008.

==Program==
The school's strengths are evident in its academics, extracurricular activities, and notable faculty, many of whom hold doctorates in their respective fields.<ref>[http://bcts.bergen.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=224&Itemid=1045 Academy Faculty], Bergen County Academies. Accessed [[July 16]], [[2007]].</ref> The school also offers individual research opportunities which allow students to compete in science fairs on local to international levels. Seniors participate in Senior Experience, <ref>[http://bcts.bergen.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=408&Itemid=839 Senior Experience], Bergen County Academies. Accessed [[July 16]], [[2007]].</ref> a [[cooperative education]] or [[intern]]ship program through which seniors work and learn for the full business day each Wednesday instead of reporting to school. The school is involved in the [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] (AP) and [[IB Diploma Programme|International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma]] programs. Bergen County Academies was certified to offer the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) diploma in January 2004.<ref>[http://www.ibo.org/school/001501/ Bergen County Academies], [[International Baccalaureate Organization]]. Accessed [[May 24]], [[2007]].</ref> The school is one of only 16 schools in New Jersey to offer the IB program.<ref>[http://www.ibo.org/school/search/index.cfm?programmes=&country=US&region=NJ&find_schools=Find Find an IB World School<U+2014>results], [[International Baccalaureate Organization]]. Accessed [[May 24]], [[2007]].</ref>

The school is divided into seven college-preparatory academic programs. An eighth program, called the Global Leadership Exchange (GLE) exists for the graduating classes of 2008 and 2009, but does not exist for any later classes.

The school day is from 8:00 AM to 4:10 PM, accommodating a traditional high school education and higher education in specific fields. Students are permitted to enter the building much earlier than the time school begins.

While the academies are treated as a single school within the district and the state, students apply to colleges and academic programs under their respective academy, rather than BCA as a whole. Bergen County Academies itself has no [[CEEB code]].

Homerooms are referred to as "IGS" (Information Gathering Sessions). All seniors participate in the Senior Experience internship, and classes are scheduled using [[flexible modular scheduling]].

Among students, there is an elected government, or council. There are three branches to the student government: Student Council, Class Council, and the Superintendent's Congress.<ref name = "Council"> [http://bcts.bergen.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=164&Itemid=791 Student Government], Bergen County Academies. Accessed [[July 16]], [[2007]].</ref> Each graduating class elects its own Class Council with required council experience to perform functions limited in scope to a single class. The Superintendent's Congress consists of representatives from every academy recommended by teachers.<ref name = Council/>

==History==
The campus was called the [[Bergen County Technical High School]] before it became the academies. BCA began as a single academy, "The Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology" (AAST), which inducted students in 1992 for the graduating class of 1996.<ref name = BCAwelcome/> 

In 1997, additional academies opened on the campus: the Academy for Business and Computer Technology (ABCT), the Academy for Engineering Design Technology (AEDT), and the Academy for Medical Science Technology (AMST). The following year, three career institutes, renamed a year later to become academies: the Academy for Culinary Arts (ACA), the Academy for Power and Transportation (APT), and the Academy for Visual Arts and Graphic Communications (AVAGC). Soon, the seven programs were geared less towards career prep and more towards college prep, adopting a liberal arts curriculum with an extra focus on their respective fields.

In 2002, APT was replaced, ABCT was split and renamed the Academy for Business and Finance (ABF) and the Academy for Telecommunications and Computer Science (ATCS), ACA added hotel administration to its coursework and became the Academy for Culinary Arts and Hotel Administration (ACAHA), and AVAGC expanded its scope to include performing arts and became the Academy for Visual and Performing Arts (AVPA).<ref>[http://www.academyppo.com/academy/academies.shtml Academy Parent Partnership Organization]</ref> 

The school itself also changed its name numerous times, from "Bergen County Regional Academies" to "Bergen Academies", to "Bergen County Academy" and to the present "Bergen County Academies".

In 2001, a major dispute initiated by the Bergen County School Administrators' Association focused on what Paramus Superintendent Janice Dime called "elitism." Several of these districts threatened to withdraw funding from the program. The Bergen County Technical Schools agreed to increase the transparency of the admissions process and enter into talks with a number of sending districts. For the 2006 - 2007 school year, districts paid annual tuition of $6600 for each student.

==Admissions==
Though it is a public school, the admission process is selective.<ref name = "admissionprocess"> [http://bcts.bergen.org/index.php?option=com_multilink&Itemid=1354 Admission process], Bergen County Academies. Accessed [[July 16]], [[2007]]. </ref> The number of successful candidates for admission is widely thought to hover around 15% of those that apply. A math and English test, as well as an interview by a panel of teachers, is required for admission.

Tuition is free for residents of Bergen County and is paid for by the student's home school district, the State of New Jersey, and a number of public and private grants. Payments from sending districts are mandated by both state and county legislation affecting vocational and technical districts such as BCTS.

BCA serves all 70 municipalities of Bergen County. In recent years, classes of 250 - 270 have been accepted from an applicant pool of 1100 - 1200.<ref>[http://bcts.bergen.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=431&Itemid=1217 Admissions FAQ], Bergen County Academies. Accessed [[July 16]], [[2007]].</ref> Limits are held on the number of students that can be accepted from each district, with the limit being based on the size of the high school. The school reports that there are "4 or 5 districts where this is a problem."

==The Academies==
The academies are listed here in order of identification numbers. The first two academies (AAST and AEDT) share parallel schedules and science courses each year; they merge in core classes. The last three (ATCS, ACAHA, and AVPA) have science courses spread through the four years similarly, also sharing courses and classes.<ref name = BCAwelcome/> The academies are generally referred to by their acronyms (first set of parentheses), and more commonly by single-word nicknames (second set).

=====The Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology (AAST) (Science)=====
AAST was founded on a charter school framework in 1992 with the mission of preparing students for careers in math and science by promoting a problem-solving, project-based, technical learning environment.<ref name = BCAwelcome/> AAST has departed from this model and has become a more standard magnet school. The roots of the program can be seen in its unique science curriculum, which emphasizes and integrates chemistry, biology and physics, and its hallmark Wednesday lab rotation for the first two years. This academy celebrated ten years of excellence in 2006-07. Much of the AAST model, including the 6-mod project period on Wednesday, has been adopted by the other academies.

=====The Academy for Engineering and Design Technology (AEDT) (Engineering)=====
This academy's core curriculum is similar to that of AAST. The two programs share the same core courses, but AEDT directs students away from some of AAST's focus on biology in order to provide room for courses in electronics and design increasingly in upper grades. However, a neuroscience course called Physiological Control Systems is required for all junior AEDT students. The program encourages students to take part in several competitions such as "BattleBots IQ". Students in AEDT take the required science courses with AAST, as well as its own engineering courses, like [[civil engineering]] and Digital Electronics. The only courses that are mandatory for AAST and not AEDT are biology electives.

=====The Academy for Business and Finance (ABF or ABFIB) (Business)=====
Originally called the Academy for Business and Computer Technology (ABCT), the academy participates in the [[IB Diploma Programme|IB Diploma Program]]<ref name = BCAwelcome/> beginning in 11th grade. ABF is the only academy required to participate in the IB program, but students in other academies are welcome to as well should they pass an entrance exam. Students in the Business Academy take extra courses in economics, management, [[SAP AG|SAP Technology]], business ethics, and the rigorous IB curriculum.

=====The Academy for Medical Science Technology (AMST) (Medical or Med)=====
Students in this academy take more biology courses than other BCA students. Required courses in biology beyond introductory biology, which all other students take, are Medical Science Seminar, Biotechnology, Zoology, Anatomy and Physiology, Bioethics, plus four additional electives.<ref>[http://users.bergen.org/dondew/bio/biodept/reqbioAMST2.html Information on AMST]</ref> Medical students typically take literature and history courses alongside business students.

=====The Academy for Culinary Arts and Hotel Administration (ACAHA or ACHA) (Culinary)=====
Founded in 1997 {{Fact|date=December 2007}} and originally called the Academy for Culinary Arts (ACA), the program represented a culinary vocational program that was reworked to give students a more academic focus. Originally grouped with APT and AVAGC (see abbreviations stated previously) as "career" academies, they were set apart from the college prep programs of AAST, ABCT, AEDT and AMST. After being reorganized into academic, college-prep academies, the name changed to the present name in 2002 to reflect the change in emphasis and curriculum. Head instructor Mary Beth Brace has been recognized as Advisor of the Year for SkillsUSA and has received attention for devotion as a baking and culinary arts instructor. Chef John Branda, who worked in the food service industry for 30 years, was the [[saucier]] at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and co-owned an upscale [[Fair Lawn, New Jersey]] restaurant.<ref> [http://leadernewspapers.net/modules.php?name=News&file=print&sid=1873 Branda Named Teacher of the Year] </ref>

=====The Academy for Telecommunications and Computer Science (ATCS) (Telecom)=====
This academy has a primary focus in the world of computers and the Internet. Its students are well-prepared for careers as computer programmers, software engineers, networking technicians, and other computer-related professions. ATCS students study material from [[Cisco Systems]] and [[Oracle Corporation]] and compete in competitions against other schools and colleges.

=====The Academy for Visual and Performing Arts (AVPA) (Visual/Music/Theater)=====
This academy is unique for being subdivided into two main divisions: Visual Arts and Performing Arts. Under the Visual division is the Visual Academy. Under the Performing division, there are the Theatre and Music Academies. Visual, Performing, and Music students have performed at venues in nearby New York City. {{Fact|date=April 2007}} Depending on their focus, students in AVPA take classes in drawing, painting, printing, acting, and stagecraft, or music and music theory.<ref name = "Arts"> [http://bcts.bergen.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=686&Itemid=761 AVPA Main], Bergen County Academies. Accessed [[July 16]], [[2007]].</ref>

=====Global Leadership Exchange (GLE)=====
Started in 2004 to first support the class of 2008, GLE is the newest program at the Academies; its focus is the field of biotechnology and global leadership. It was initially designed to give its students the state high school requirements in two years, with International Baccalaureate courses being later added to the program. Much of its focus and goals are now being integrated into the Academy for Medical Science Technology. The GLE program only existed for the classes of 2008 and 2009. <ref name = BCAwelcome/>

==Academics==
There are eighteen academic departments of BCA: Biology, Business, Chemistry, Culinary Arts, Engineering, English, Health/PE, History, Journalism, Mathematics, Music, Physics, Studio Arts and Graphic Communications, Technology, Theater Arts, Senior Experience, Visual Arts, and World Languages. Besides specific classes and requirements, all academies require four years English, mathematics, physical education; three years social studies, science, and world language; two years technology and art/music.<ref name = BCAwelcome/> All students take three years of projects and clubs, with clubs placed at the last three mods on Wednesday. Over one hundred electives of diverse fields are offered and most are available to all students. (see the ''[[Bergen County Academies#Scheduling|Scheduling]]'' section.) In addition, 40 hours of community service is required for graduation.<ref name = BCAwelcome/>

===Mathematics===
Students in ABF who participate in the IB program have two years of Integrated Math and two years of IB Math. Other students generally follow the in-house mathematics curriculum with an advanced nature, which begins with [[algebra]] and continues to [[linear algebra]], [[multivariable calculus]], and beyond. It begins with the pre-calculus sequence <ref name = "Coursecatalog"> [http://bcts.bergen.org/images/stories/BCTS/pdf/BCA_Course_Catalog.pdf PDF File of Course Catalog], Bergen County Academies. Accessed [[July 16]], [[2007]].</ref> <small>(loose reference)</small>.

{| width="100%" textalign="left"
|-

| Math Analysis I ''or'' <br /> Adv. Math Analysis I 
| width="2em" | <math>\rightarrow</math>
| Math Analysis II ''or'' <br /> Adv. Math Analysis II
|}

This prepares the student for Statistics or AP Statistics, or the more common calculus sequence:

{| width="100%"
|-
| Calculus I ''or'' <br /> [[AP Calculus AB]] ''or'' <br /> [[AP Calculus BC]] ''or'' <br /> AP Analytical Calculus (BC+)

| width="2em" | <math>\rightarrow</math>
| Topics in Advanced Mathematics ''or'' <br /> Data Structures
|}

Students place into a course in the pre-calculus sequence and continue up, taking one course in each group. The full sequence requires six years; fewer than twenty students from each graduating class reach Topics in Advanced Mathematics, which is not unexpected given the advanced nature of the course. The BCA course catalog states:

<blockquote>This is our most advanced course. Designed for the exceptionally well-prepared student, this course covers material that is two years beyond the curriculum of BC Calculus. As such, the material varies from year to year, currently covering a sweeping introduction to three cornerstones of Mathematics, namely, Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra and Real Analysis. Vector spaces, linear operators, groups, fields and rings, and the topological underpinnings of Calculus are covered. Emphasis is placed on rigor and proof.</blockquote>

An often-noted shortcoming of this otherwise rigorous curriculum is its lack of geometry, which spans a full year in traditional high schools. As of 2007, geometry is briefly covered in the introductory course "Geometric Concepts", a one-trimester elective, in Analysis I (for the first trimester) / Advanced Analysis I (for six-weeks) or in various six-module projects dealing with geometry. {{Fact|date=April 2007}}

==Scheduling==
Students currently observe a form of [[flexible modular scheduling]]. 

Prior to the 2007-2008 academic year, the full school day lasted from 8:00 am to 4:10 pm and began with a 10-minute IGS followed by 24 modules (commonly referred to as "mods") that last 17 minutes; there were 3 minutes after each mod. (Each three-mod block was 60 minutes.)

A revised schedule was implemented in the 2007-8 school year. Two minutes were cut from each mod (to 15 minutes), IGS was cut by 6 minutes, the three minutes after each mod was preserved, and the number of mods extended to 27, with the day still lasting from 8:00 to 4:10.<ref name = BCAwelcome/> The Principal's Advisory Team strongly supported this schedule, giving students more time for electives and interaction. Classes still typically last three mods, or 51 minutes. (Each three-mod block is 54 minutes.) 

Classes meet variably every day. Every week, a class may meet four hours per week for AP programs or high-level classes to two hours per week for electives. On Wednesday, students attend projects for six mods; students with labs meet for four mods for laboratory work, relevant to their chemistry, physics, or biology courses, in rotation. Wednesday labs and projects last four and six mods respectively. Extracurricular activities occur after the school day. Previously, AAST and AEDT shared almost all their core courses and the other academies shared their core courses. There is an effort underway to diversify classes by mixing the different academies. {{Fact|date=November 2007}}

There are upper and lower limits to a student's free mods, or mods with no class. Students report to their elected clubs during the last three mods on Wednesday.

In 2005, Superintendent Robert Aloia suggested a new scheduling scheme be implemented. The schedule was criticized because it eliminated many 2-mod classes. Other scheduling schemes lacking free mods were suggested, but have not been adopted. {{Fact|date=April 2007}}

==The Arts==
Students of all academies participate in various studio and performing arts courses. The Bergen County Academies Concert and Chamber Choirs have won excellent ratings and awards at local and national competitions under Dr. [[Patrick D. Finley]]. The Academies offer college-level courses in music theory, including [[AP Music Theory]] and Advanced Problems in Music Theory.<ref name = Coursecatalog/> The instrumental performance program offers other features, including an opportunity for students to play with the North Jersey Philharmonic and the Guitar and Mandolin Society.

The school features two studio art labs. The artwork produced has won awards in local competitions. The second studio is a visual arts lab equipped with compositing and printing equipment to train students in graphic communication and print media.<ref name = Arts/>

The theatre arts department puts on plays and musicals each year in an auditorium seating 1,200, sometimes rented to outside professional groups. {{Fact|date=April 2007}} The school has a restaurant-grade kitchen for teaching culinary arts, featuring the Academy Grill, which serves meals prepared by the school's culinary arts students. {{Fact|date=April 2007}} The Bergen Academies Video Lab broadcasts inside the school, featuring workstations, professional cameras, and a [[bluescreen]].{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

==Extracurricular activities==
===AAST Math Team===
With over 150 students from grades 12 and below in participation, AAST Math Team is a large extracurricular team at the Academies. Since its inception, the team has been coached by Joseph Holbrook, who is also the chair of the mathematics department. In line with the school's original philosophy, Holbrook created a model for mathematics education that was directed at solving non-standard problems, without concerning traditional time restraints and curricula. Holbrook runs problem-solving sessions on Saturdays and Sundays, which function as practice sessions for team members. This model has been adapted to create programs for local middle school students.<ref>[http://bcts.bergen.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=849&Itemid=735 Academy After Hours], Bergen County Academies. Accessed [[July 16]], [[2007]].</ref> Students are encouraged to come to practices and participate with the team in high school math competitions.

The AAST Math Team participates in competitions such as the [[American Mathematics Competitions|AMCs]], [[American Invitational Mathematics Examination|AIME]], [[United States of America Mathematical Olympiad|USAMO]], [[Mandelbrot Competition|Mandelbrot]], [[Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament]], and [[American Regions Mathematics League|ARML]]. The team often ranks within the top ten in competitions it enters, competing against top magnet schools and state and regional teams. The team has been nationally ranked in the top three in each of the past five years of the [[Mandelbrot Competition]].<ref>[http://web.mandelbrot.org/scores.html Mandelbrot Rankings] </ref>

On November 15th, 2008, the AAST math team placed 2nd to the A team of Thomas Jefferon High School for the Duke Math Meet.

Although the AAST Math Team is open to all academies, it is still known as "AAST" for historical and logistical reasons.

===FreshAngles===
As part of a co-curricular program run through the Academies' [[Journalism]] and [[English language|English]] departments, students run a current events website known as ''FreshAngles'' and was located at freshangles.com. FreshAngles is a project where students participate by taking electives in Journalism and Wire Editing, where students learn how to acquire articles from the [[Associated Press|AP]] wire. Teenvoice also had collaborations with [[Columbia University|Columbia University's]] [http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/ Center for New Media], [[Fred W. Friendly|Fred Friendly Seminars]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television's]] [[ABC 2000 Today]], as well as local high schools' newspapers.

The site debuted on [[January 27]] [[1997]], originally located at ''teenvoice.com'' and known as ''in-site'', later changing its name to ''Teenvoice''. <ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20010221063417/www.teenvoice.com/about_more.html About Teenvoice.com], archived [[February 21]], [[2001]], accessed from archive [[April 23]], [[2007]].</ref> In 2000, Women Express, Inc., publisher of ''[http://www.teenvoices.com Teen Voices]'' magazine, threatened with a copyright infringement lawsuit for using the name Teenvoice, so the name of the website changed to FreshAngles on [[May 9]] [[2001]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20010509141857/http://www.freshangles.com/ FreshAngles], archived [[May 9]], [[2001]], accessed from archive [[April 23]], [[2007]].</ref> <ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20010516003629/www.freshangles.com/newsite/ Teenvoice.com redirects to FreshAngles.com], archived [[May 16]], [[2001]], accessed from archive [[April 23]], [[2007]].</ref>

===Sports===
The Academies shares its sports program with the [[Bergen County Technical High School]]. The boys' teams, called the Bergen Tech Knights, and the girls' teams, the Bergen Tech Lady Knights, have formerly played in the [[BCSL Olympic]] athletic conference. {{Fact|date=April 2007}} Bergen Tech has been placed in the [[Northern New Jersey Interscholastic League]] (NNJIL) for the start of the Fall 2006 athletic season. The tennis team and baseball team advanced to the North I Group IV State playoffs in 2005, with the tennis team continuing on to the semifinals after winning sectionals.<ref>[http://www.bracketmaker.com/tmenu.cfm?tid=106049&tclass=North%20I%2C%20Group%20IV 2005 Boys Team Tennis - North I, Group IV], [[NJSIAA]], accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]].</ref><ref>[http://www.bracketmaker.com/tmenu.cfm?tid=107442&tclass=North%20I%2C%20Group%20IV 2005 Baseball - North I, Group IV], [[NJSIAA]], accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]].</ref>

In 2006, the football team reached the playoffs, falling to [[Randolph High School]] 29-0 in football.<ref>[http://www.bracketmaker.com/tmenu.cfm?tid=188015&tclass=North%20I%2C%20Group%20IV 2006 Football Tournament - North I, Group IV], [[NJSIAA]], accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]].</ref> The boys soccer team advanced to the 2006 state tournament, winning in the first round before losing to [[Memorial High School (West New York, New Jersey)|Memorial High School]] in the semifinal game.<ref>[http://www.bracketmaker.com/tmenu.cfm?tid=186283&tclass=North%20I%2C%20Group%20IV 2006 Boys Soccer Tournament - North I, Group IV], [[NJSIAA]], accessed [[April 23]], [[2007]].</ref>

Numerous sports are offered for boys and girls, including basketball, bowling, golf, lacrosse, soccer, track, tennis, and volleyball. For boys, offerings also include football and wrestling. For girls, the program also includes cheerleading (club program) and softball. During the 2007-2008 school year, a varsity fencing team was initiated by a coalition of several parents along with the Athletic Department, and as of now the team has obtained a coach and looks to be moving forward. If a particular sport is offered by the student's home district but not by the Academy (i.e. ice hockey, swimming), that student may join and participate with his local school's team. {{Fact|date=April 2007}}

===Other activities===
The Academies' [[BattleBots]] IQ team, known as the [http://sites.bergen.org/BattleBots/ Titanium Knights], won the 2006 national heavyweight championship in the high school division with the robot ''E2V2'', <ref> [http://www.battlebotsiq.com/news.php 2006 Results for BattleBots IQ] </ref> and won two other awards for another 120lb robot, ''Knightrous''.
