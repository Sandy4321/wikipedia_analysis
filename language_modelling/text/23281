He is considered the father of [[Canadian Jewry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shalomquebec.org/members.aspx?mid=349|title=Hart, Aaron|accessdate=2009-03-25|work=Exposition Shalom Qu<U+00E9>bec}}</ref> He was the father of politician [[Ezekiel Hart]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
He was born [[August 16]], [[1724]], at [[London]], [[England]], to Yehezkel (Ezekiel) and Judah Hirsh, who were both from [[Bavaria]] (they later changed their name to Hart, the English version of their name). 

After a stay in [[Jamaica]], in [[1756]], Aaron Hart went to [[New York]] to live with his relatives. He was soon joined by his brothers Harmon and Bernard; his brother Leman stayed in London to supervise the organization of a distillery. In [[1759]], he joined the St. Paul's [[Masonic Lodge|Lodge of Freemasons]].

It is often mistaken that he crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] with Sir [[Frederick Haldimand]] during a war between [[England]] and [[France]]. Hart was appointed [[Commissariat|commissary officer]] in [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]]'s army, and he travelled north and entered [[Montreal]] with Amherst's army in 1760. He settled at [[Trois-Rivi<U+00E8>res, Quebec|Trois-Rivi<U+00E8>res]] in 1761. Hart supplied the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops stationed there. He was appointed [[postmaster]] of Trois-Rivi<U+00E8>res in [[August]] [[1763]]. 

On [[January 14]], [[1768]], Aaron wed his cousin Dorothea Catherine Judah in [[Portsmouth]], England. The marriage brought his cousins and brothers-in-law Uriah and Samuel to Trois-Rivi<U+00E8>res and formed the nucleus of a large family which included four sons - Moses, Ezekiel, Benjamin, and Alexander (Asher) - and five daughters educated by the [[Ursulines]] in Trois-Rivi<U+00E8>res. One daughter, Chavah, married a Judah and two others, Sarah and Charlotte, married Samuel and Moses David respectively, sons of Montreal's Lazarus David.

===Career===
Hart invested in the [[fur trade]] and later acquired a vast amount of property, having more than seven [[Manorialism|seigneuries]], notably the seigneuries of [[Sainte-Marguerite]], Vieux-Pont, and [[B<U+00E9>cancour, Quebec|B<U+00E9>cancour]]. He bought the [[Fiefdom|fief]] of Bruy<U+00E8>res and the marquisate of Le Sable and numerous other properties in and around Trois-Rivi<U+00E8>res. He also possessed part of [[Trinity Island]], and the mouth of [[Saint-Maurice River|Saint-Maurice]].

Hart also operated a store in Trois-Rivi<U+00E8>res, where he conducted a diverse [[wholesale]] and [[Retailing|retail]] business, and extended commercial and real estate loans throughout a wide area around the town. Prospering by these diverse operations, he bequeathed a huge legacy to his eight children; his four sons inherited the vast bulk of his estate, while his four daughters received <U+00A3>1,000 each. 
 
At his residence in Trois-Rivi<U+00E8>res he received a visit from [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|Prince Edward]], the father of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. The first [[Papal legate|Papal Envoy]] to the country was also the guest of his hospitable [[Manor house|manor]]. He assisted in repelling [[Richard Montgomery|Montgomery]]'s invasion in the winter of [[1775]], and took an active part in the military operations of that period.

===Death===
He died at Trois-Rivi<U+00E8>res on [[December 28]] [[1800]], at the age of 76. On his death he was reputed to be the wealthiest man in British Canada.

He left four sons: [[Moses Hart|Moses]], [[Ezekiel Hart|Ezekiel]], [[Benjamin Hart (businessman)|Benjamin]], and Alexander, and four daughters: Catharine, Charlotte, Elizabeth, and Sarah.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.americanjewisharchives.org/pdfs/stern_p095.pdf Hart Family Tree at the ''American Jewish Archives'']|663.79&nbsp;KB}}</ref> His will contained an impressive list of bequests to his wife and children. He left a seigneury to his sons, as well as land and a house in the center of Trois-Rivi<U+00E8>res. He left his family a thriving business and assets that his children would go on to expand.

A number of his descendants settled in New York, and became active members of the [[Congregation Shearith Israel]].

His second son, [[Ezekiel Hart]], who entered into the family business at Trois-Rivi<U+00E8>res and later opened a brewery with his brothers, was elected to the legislative assembly but later expelled from his seat because he was a Jew. His son Moses became a businessman at William-Henry (later [[Sorel, Quebec|Sorel]]) and ran unsuccessfully several times for a seat in the legislative assembly. His son Benjamin became an important businessman in [[Montreal]].
