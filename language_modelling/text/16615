'''Cesar Legaspi''' ([[1917]]-[[1994]]) was a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[National Artists of the Philippines|National Artist awardee]] in painting.  He is also an [[illustrator]] and artistic [[director]].  His works are described to be depictions of anguish and dehumanization of beggars and laborers in the city.  His works include ''Man and Woman'' (alternatively known as ''Beggars''), ''Gadgets'' and ''Procession''.  Critics further described that Legaspi "reconstituted" in his paintings "[[cubist|cubism]]'s unfeeling, geometric ordering of figures into a social expressionism rendered by interacting forms filled with rhythmic movement".<ref name=Endaya>Endaya, Imelda Cajipe (artist and independent curator) and Cecilia B.
