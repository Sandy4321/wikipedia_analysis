'''''Alzheimer''''' is a record by [[music of Spain|Spanish]] [[heavy metal music|metal]] [[rapping|rap]] band [[Def Con Dos]].

Released by P & C Dro, S.A. record company in 1995, it helped Def Con Dos to maintain the popularity they had obtained with Armas pal pueblo and their theme for [[<U+00C1>lex de la Iglesia]]'s film ''Mutan Action''.

The cover presents DCD's logo under a red paint V letter, probably a reference to [[V (TV series)|V]], a TV series from the 1980s. An inner photograph depicted DCD group members with the images of their faces distorted, and the hands in a [[V sign]] (palm towards them, as in the British, like in the British insulting sign).

The lyrics were less complex than in previous records, with fewer verbal puns and references to other artists' lyrics. There were however abundant references to recent news.

===Tracks listed===
All themes are composed by Def Con Dos (save ''Fight For Your Right (Bebe y Lucha)'' by [[Beastie Boys]] and [[Rick Rubin]]) and sung in Spanish (save ''Que te fagorishen'' and ''Garaipena'').

''My kingdom for''...
About deposed kings, translation of the refrain is "My kingdom for a bit of

At the beginning of the track, a female voice explains that Beastie Boys have not allowed the recording of this song with the lyrics proposed by Def Con Dos (explicit on drugs, sex and violence), so DCD encourage the listener to sing the lyrics in the booklet.
