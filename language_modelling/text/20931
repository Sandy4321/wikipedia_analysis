==History==

In 1802 the first wooden [[dam]] and a [[gristmill]] were built on the river at the site of the village, which was then known as Nichols Bridge.<ref name=RIHSrichmond>[http://www.preservation.ri.gov/pdfs_zips_downloads/survey_pdfs/richmond.pdf Historic and Architectural Resources of Richmond, Rhode Island: A Preliminary Report], Rhode Island Historical Preservation Commission, 1977</ref><ref name=RIHScharlestown>[http://www.preservation.ri.gov/pdfs_zips_downloads/survey_pdfs/charlestown.pdf Historic and Architectural Resources of Charlestown, Rhode Island: A Preliminary Report], Rhode Island Historical Preservation Commission, 1981</ref>  A few years later, a [[cotton mill]] was established, with production buildings mostly located in Richmond, but some employee housing located across the river in Charlestown. In 1843 [[Rowland G. Hazard]] bought the mill, renaming it the Carolina Mills Company in honor of his wife, Caroline Newbold Hazard of [[South Kingstown]]. The village around the mill was also given the same name.<ref name=RIHSmillrecords/>  The Rhode Island Historic Preservation Commission described 19th-century Carolina as a "center for the surrounding area, including a school, a church, a post office, a bank, several stores, a [[blacksmith]] shop, and halls for meetings, lectures, and 'entertainments'."<ref name=RIHScharlestown/> The local [[post office]] was named "Carolina Mills" from 1850 until 1879, when it was renamed "Carolina."<ref>[http://thesaltysailor.com/rhodeisland-philatelic/rhodeisland/settle-8.htm Rhode Island Historical Society Postal History Collection website], accessed July 9, 2009</ref>

In 1862 the complex switched from cotton textile production to production of woolens. The Hazard family operated the mill complex until 1863, when they leased it to T.R. Hyde & Co., which was a partnership between Thomas R. Hyde and Rowland Hazard II that operated the mill until 1868. The mill was sold to new owners in 1869, but Rowland Hazard II operated it as a lessee until at least 1877.<ref name=RIHSmillrecords>[http://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss483sg23.htm Carolina Mills Records], Rhode Island Historical Society, Manuscripts Division</ref> The mill complex operated until 1930<ref>[http://thesaltysailor.com/rhodeisland-philatelic/rhodeisland/stampless10.htm#mills-history Rhode Island Historical Society Postal History Collection website], accessed July 9, 2009</ref> or 1935.<ref name=RIHSrichmond/>

[[File:American Fish Culture 1994.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Raceways for trout and a fish hatchery house at the American Fish Culture Company, Carolina, Rhode Island in 1994]]The mill complex deteriorated after its closure, and Carolina became a residential community.<ref name=RIHScharlestown/> However, other components of the village remained intact and the village was listed on the National Register in 1974. The portion of Carolina village in the town of Richmond includes a "corridor" of about two dozen one-story and one-and-a-half-story cottages and other domestic buildings built between about 1840 and 1870. Other buildings of historic interest include the remains of the mill; the Carolina School, built in 1845; the Carolina Free Will Baptist Church, built in 1845 and relocated in 1865; the octagonal [[Albert S. Potter Octagon House|Albert Potter House]], built in 1867; and a 2<U+00BD>-story [[Queen Anne-style]] house built by Ellison Tinkham, who was one of the owners of the mills from 1868 until 1907.<ref name=RIHSrichmond/><ref name=RIHScharlestown/>

Carolina was also the site of the establishment of one of the first [[fish farming|trout farms]] in America.  In 1877 John W. Hoxie established the ''Clearwater Trout Farm'' on White Brook from land leased from Rowland G. Hazard, north of the village center.  Two years later Hoxie's brother, Charles, established his own ''White Brook Trout Hatchery'' on an adjacent plot of land along the brook.  By 1892 the White Brook Trout Hatchery was incorporated as the ''American Fish Culture Company'' with Rowland Hazard II as a minority shareholder.  In 1899 the Hazard family gained controlling interest in the corporation.  Upon the death of John W. Hoxie in 1903, the R. Hazard Estate acquired full interest in Clearwater Trout Farm, and both farms were eventually merged and operated as American Fish Culture Company by the Hazard Family until its sale to the State of [[Rhode Island]] in 1995.<ref>[[Michael A.
