'''''Mom & Me & Mom''''' (2013) is the seventh book in author [[Maya Angelou]]'s series of [[autobiographies]].  The book was published shortly before [[Mother's Day (United States)|Mother's Day]] and Angelou's 85th birthday.  It focuses, for the first time in her books, on Angelou's relationship with her mother, Vivian Baxter.  The book explains Baxter's behavior, especially Baxter's abandonment of Angelou and Angelou's older brother when they were young children, and fill in "what are possibly the final blanks in Angelou's eventful life".<ref name=":3" />  The book also chronicles Angelou's reunion and reconciliation with Baxter.  Angelou was well-respected as a poet and writer, and was one of the first African American female writers to openly discuss her life through the autobiography.    

''Mom & Me & Mom'' is an overview of Angelou's life and revisits many of the same anecdotes she relates in her previous books.  The first section, entitled "Mom & Me", centers on Angelou's early years, before the age of 17, and transition from resentment and distrust of her mother to acceptance, support, and love towards her.  After Baxter helps her through the birth of her son, Angelou goes from calling her mother "Lady" to "Mom".  In the book's second section, entitled "Me & Mom", Angelou chronicles the unconditional love, support, and assistance they gave to each other, as Baxter helps her through single motherhood, a failed marriage, and career ups and downs.  As she had begun to do in ''Caged Bird'', and continued throughout her series, Angelou upheld the long tradition of African American autobiography. At the same time she made a deliberate attempt to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre.  She had become recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women. Angelou was, as scholar Joanne Braxton has stated, "without a doubt, ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer".<ref name=":14" />  She had also become "a major autobiographical voice of the time".<ref name=":15" />

Like Angelou's previous autobiographies,'' Mom & Me & Mom'' received mostly positive reviews.  Most reviewers state that Baxter is presented well in the book.  Angelou celebrates the unconditional acceptance and support of her mother, who comes across "as a street-smart, caring woman who shaped the author's life and legacy by her words and example".<ref name=":6" />  The book has been called "a profoundly moving tale of separation and reunion, and an ultimately optimistic portrait of the maternal bond".<ref name=":3" />    

An audio version of the book, read by Angelou, was released in CD form and as a digital download.  Pictures of Angelou, Baxter, and members of their family appear through the book and enhance the text.

Angelou begins the book with a prologue, in which she explains why she wrote it: how she became, despite being born poor, Black, and female, Maya Angelou.  The book is divided into two sections; the first 13 chapters into the first section, called "Mom & Me", and the remaining chapters in the second, called "Me & Mom".  Angelou thanks her mother, "who generously taught me how to be a mother", which allowed her to dedicate the book to her son, Guy Bailey Johnson, whom she calls "one of the most courageous and generous men I know".<ref>Angelou, dedication page</ref>

Angelou's mother, Vivian Baxter, was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] at the turn of the 20th century, the oldest of six children of her [[Trinidadian Creole|Trinidadian]] father and her Irish mother, who was adopted by a German family.  Baxter's family was violent yet religious and musical.  Baxter, "who was to remain a startling beauty",<ref>Angelou, p. 8</ref> met Angelou's father, Bailey Johnson, a dietitian/cook, in 1924, upon Johnson's return from serving in [[World War I]].  They married and moved to California, where Angelou and her older brother, Bailey, Jr., were born.  When she was three and Bailey was five, their parents divorced and sent their children, with identification tags and no adult supervision, to live with their paternal grandmother, Annie Henderson, in [[Stamps, Arkansas]].

Angelou and her brother lived with their grandmother and her son, Uncle Willie, until Angelou was thirteen.  They briefly visited their mother in St. Louis, but at the age of eight, Angelou was raped, the rapist was killed; she felt so guilty, she chose to stop talking to everyone but Bailey.  They were sent back to Stamps, but when Bailey turned 14, they returned to their mother's care in [[San Francisco]] for his protection.  At first, Angelou was resistant and angry towards her mother for abandoning her and Bailey, choosing to call her "Lady", and it took her several years to warm up to her.  

One summer, Bailey and Angelou made separate trips to visit their father in [[San Diego]], in what ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called "a seriously ugly meeting".<ref name=":7" />  Angelou did not get along with her stepmother.  During her visit, her father took Angelou to Mexico; he became so drunk, she had to drive him back across the border, even though she had never driven a car before.  When they returned to San Diego, Angelou's stepmother fought with her, and cut Angelou with a pair of scissors.  Angelou chose to live on the streets until her wound was healed.  When she returned to San Francisco, she decided she wanted a job as a conductorette of a streetcar; at first, she was not hired because she was Black, but upon her mother's encouragement, she was persistent with the streetcar company until she became the first Black to work on the railway.  Baxter provided security by following Angelou with a pistol.

When Angelou was seventeen, she became pregnant after a one-time encounter with a neighbor boy.  She told Bailey, who advised her to hide it from their mother and stepfather until she graduated from high school.  Three weeks before the birth of her son, she told them.  Baxter's reaction was to run a bath; as Angelou said, "In our family, for some unknown reason, we consider it an honor to run a bath, to put in bubbles and good scents for another person".<ref>Angelou, p. 73</ref>  Baxter helped Angelou through the birth; from then on, Angelou began to call her "Mother", and later, "Mom".

The rest of the book consists of a series of anecdotes about the ways that Baxter supported and accepted her daughter and continued to win her love and respect, through unwed motherhood, a failed marriage, and career ups and downs.<ref name=":9" />  The stories Angelou relate include how Baxter supported her as an independent single mother, saving her life after a jealous ex-boyfriend beat her, and Baxter's initial resistance and then acceptance of her first marriage to Greek sailor Tosh Angelos.  Angelou recounts the beginning of her career as a dancer and entertainer in San Francisco; Baxter cared for her grandson as Angelou traveled Europe as a member of the Gershwin opera ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''.  Angelou felt so guilty about leaving her son, she returned and resumed her relationship with her mother and son, eventually moving to New York City and starting a new career as a writer and poet.

Angelou relates, with pride, her mother's social activities, in the [[Order of the Eastern Star]] and Black women charitable organizations in [[Stockton, California]], as well as her career as one of the first Black female [[merchant marines]].  At one point, Baxter drops everything and comes to her daughter's aid while Angelou was working on a movie in [[Stockholm]].  Baxter supports Angelou's decision to live in Africa for a while and then, after Angelou returned to the U.S., to become a teacher at [[Wake Forest University]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]].  Angelou describes Baxter's marriage, late in her life, to Angelou's fourth stepfather, whom Baxter called her greatest love and who was Angelou's favorite.  There is a heart-breaking scene between Angelou and her brother, who despite his seemingly easy reentry into their mother's life when they were teenagers (she calls them "the new lovers"),<ref>Angelou, p. 22</ref> had descended into struggles with drug abuse.{{#tag:ref|Bailey Johnson, Jr. died in 2000, after a series of strokes.<ref>Gillespie, p. 155</ref>|group=note}}

Angelou closes ''Mom & Me & Mom'' with a description of Vivian Baxter's death in 1991, and of Angelou's final words to her on her death bed.  In 1995, the city of Stockton honored Baxter for her many years of service by naming a park after her.

==Style and genre==
Starting with ''Caged Bird'', Angelou made a deliberate attempt while writing all her autobiographies, including ''Mom & Me & Mom'', to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre.<ref>Lupton, p. 98</ref> Her use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and thematic development has often led reviewers to categorize her books as [[autobiographical fiction]].<ref>Lupton, pp. 29<U+2014>30</ref>  Valerie Sayers, in her review of ''Mom & Me & Mom'' in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', calls Angelou's books memoirs because of their limited focus, but praises her for describing what it was like to grow up Black in "[[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] America".  Sayers states: "She manages to fully reveal that national sore without picking at it, a neat trick that...requires considerable restraint and her own steely goodwill".<ref name=":4">Sayers, Valerie (27 March 2013).

Angelou's autobiographies conform to the genre's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme.<ref>Lupton, p. 32</ref>  In a 1983 interview with African American literature critic Claudia Tate, Angelou called her books autobiographies.<ref>Tate, p. 153</ref>  When speaking of her unique use of the genre, she acknowledged that she has followed the [[slave narrative]] tradition of "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'".<ref name=":1" />  Angelou recognized that there were fictional aspects to all her books; she tended to "diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth".<ref>Lupton, p. 34</ref> Her approach paralleled the conventions of many African American autobiographies written during the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] period in the US, when truth was often censored for purposes of self-protection.<ref>Sartwell, Crispin (1998).

(Spring 2006). "Journalism: The Democratic Craft". ''Newspaper Research Journal'': 84</ref>  When asked if she changed the truth to improve her story, she stated, "Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite of three or four people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about."<ref>Plimpton, George (Fall 1990).

== Critical reception ==
Mom & Me & Mom, like Angelou's previous autobiographies, received mostly positive reviews.  Fiona Sturges, who reviews the book in the British publication ''[[The Independent]]'', and reviewer Stacy Russo of ''[[Library Journal]]'' both state that Angelou's readers would recognize many of the passages in ''Mom & Me & Mom'' from her earlier autobiographies.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":5" />  Bernardine Evaristo of the London publication ''[[The Observer]]'', in one of the few negative reviews of ''Mom & Me & Mom'', calls the book "a slight, anecdotal and badly edited book that rehashes stories from previous memoirs".  Evaristo questions the veracity of Angelou's anecdotes, and states that some of them contradict earlier versions.  Evaristo also believes that ''Mom & Me & Mom'' undermines ''Caged Bird'', which she calls "a ground-breaking triumph".<ref name=":13">Evaristo, Bernardine (20 April 2014).

According to reviewer Heid Erdrich, ''Mom & Me & Mom'' does not center on Angelou's childhood trauma, as described in ''Caged Bird'', but "rather constructs a portrait of self via details of her relationship to the mother who abandoned her and with whom she reunited as a teenager".  Erdrich states that Angelou's prose is "very simply written", and calls her tone "mostly light, even sweet, filled with affection for her younger self".  Erdrich states that the even though it could have been written for young women experiencing the same difficulties Angelou faced, the book does not preach, but "presents Angelou<U+2019>s life path scattered with enormous obstacles endured and conquered through knowledge of self and a singular brand of mother love".<ref name=":11" />  [[Publishers Weekly|''Publishers Weekly'']] agrees, stating, "The lessons and love presented here will speak to those trying to make their way in the world".<ref name=":8" />  Erdrich also states that Angelou's narrative of her "hard-won love for her extraordinary mother" is compelling, and that Angelou portrays Baxter "as extraordinarily self-aware, liberated from what others might think, and independent beyond any feminist of her era" and "the stuff of fiction but real and responsible in unexpected ways for the gift of her talented daughter".<ref name=":11">Erdrich, Heid (13 April 2013). [http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/books/202597451.html "Review 'Mom & Me & Mom<U+2019> by Maya Angelou".] ''Star Tribune'' (Minneapolis, Minnesota). Retrieved 25 February 2014</ref>

Most critics feel that Baxter is presented well in ''Mom & Me & Mom''.  Candace Smith, who reviews the audio version of the book, states that Angelou celebrates the unconditional acceptance and support of her mother, who comes across "as a street-smart, caring woman who shaped the author's life and legacy by her words and example".<ref name=":6" />  Vanessa Bush of ''[[Booklist]]'' calls the book a "loving recollection of a complicated relationship" and a "remarkable and deeply revealing chronicle of love and healing".<ref name=":9" />  Russo states that the book is "a beautiful tribute to Baxter's independent, vibrant, and courageous spirit".<ref name=":5" />  Evaristo disagrees, and states that Baxter comes across as "less rounded, less interesting, more sanctified and less credible" than Angelou describes her elsewhere.<ref name=":13" />  Sturges calls the book "a profoundly moving tale of separation and reunion, and an ultimately optimistic portrait of the maternal bond".  The most interesting part of the book, according to Sturges, is "Angelou's casual overturning of the idea of the mother who abandons her children as monstrous and inhumane".  Sturges also says that Baxter is presented as unapologetic, charismatic, independent and resilient, traits that "have seemingly been passed on to her daughter".<ref name=":3" />  Reviewer Valerie Sayers insists that the scenes that depict Angelou's "halting steps" towards her forgiveness and acceptance of her mother are among the best in the book.  Sayers labels ''Mom & Me & Mom'' "an account of forgiveness", and like Angelou and Baxter, "just revealing enough, and pretty irresistible".<ref name=":4" />  Like her mother expected from her, Angelou expects her readers to move past their resentments and "whatever was unbearable".  Sayers also calls both Baxter and Angelou "a Large Dramatic Presence", and says that Angelou matches her mother's spirit.<ref name=":4" />  

According to Sayers, the book contains Angelou's "trademark good humor and fierce optimism".<ref name=":4" />  ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' states that true to Angelou's style, her writing "cuts to the chase with compression and simplicity", and that it contains a "[[Calypso music|calypso]] smoothness, flurries and showers of musicality between the moments of wickedness".  Kirkus also calls the book a "tightly strung, finely tuned memoir".<ref name=":7" />  According to Candace Smith in her review of the book's audio version, Angelou performs it "in her characteristic slow and thoughtful tones, and with careful enunciation".  Although some of her anecdotes are painful to hear, Angelou is "unquestionably honest".  Smith also states, "Although her voice doesn't show much outward emotion, her words are so powerful and the stories so fascinating that we remain riveted".<ref name=":6" />

Most critics agreed that the book would be popular with readers familiar with Angelou's writings and to her new readers.  Marjorie Keje of The Christian Science Monitor, who calls it "a story of redemption" and "a tender read and a lovely tribute",<ref name=":12" /> anticipates that Angelou's readers would delight in it.  Russo predicts that due to Angelou's popularity and "approachable writing", the book would have wide appeal for many readers.<ref name=":5" />
