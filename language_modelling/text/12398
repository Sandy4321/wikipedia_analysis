'''Vigor's Sunbird''' or '''Western Crimson Sunbird''' (''Aethopyga vigorsii'') is a species of [[sunbird]] which is endemic to the [[Western Ghats]] of India. It has been considered as a subspecies of the [[Crimson Sunbird]] (''Aethopyga siparaja'') but it does not have the central tail as elongated and is restricted in its distribution. The male has yellow on the lower back and tail is bottle green. The species is distributed mainly in the northern Western Ghats but has been reported from the Nilgiris.<ref name=pcr>{{cite book|author=Rasmussen PC & JC Anderton| year=2005| title=Birds of South Asia.
