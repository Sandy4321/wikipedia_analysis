'''Varaztirots II Bagratuni''' (ca. 590 <U+2013> 645) was an Armenian ''[[nakharar]]'' from the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratuni]] family, the son of [[Smbat IV Bagratuni]]. He was [[Marzpanate Period|''marzpan'' of Armenia]] ca. 628, fled to the [[Byzantine Empire]] soon thereafter and was exiled for several years to [[Exarchate of Africa|Africa]] for his participation in a plot against [[Heraclius]]. On his return ca. 645/6, he was named ''[[curopalates]]'' and [[Principality of Armenia|presiding prince of Armenia]], but died before being formally invested.

== Life ==
Varaztirots was the eldest son of [[Smbat IV Bagratuni]]. Along with his brother Garikhpet, he grew up in the [[Sassanid Persia]]n court of [[Khosrau II]] (r. 591<U+2013>628). Following the defeat of the rebellion of [[Vistahm]], in which his father was instrumental, Varaztirots was named a royal cupbearer. At that point, or after Smbat's victory over the [[Hephthalites]] in 608, he also received the honorific name ''Javitean Khosrow'' ("Eternal Khosrau").<ref name="PLRE">Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), pp. 1363<U+2013>1364</ref><ref>Pourshariati (2008), pp. 153<U+2013>154</ref>

In 628, Khosrau II was overthrown after a conspiracy in which several aristocratic houses, including Varaztirots, took part. As a reward, the new Persian ''[[shah]]'', [[Kavadh II]], appointed Varaztirots as ''[[marzpan]]'' of [[Marzpanate Armenia|Armenia]], with the rank of ''[[aspet]]''.<ref name="PLRE"/><ref>Pourshariati (2008), pp. 153<U+2013>154, 173<U+2013>174</ref> He soon quarrelled with the Persian governor of neighbouring [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]], however, and fled with his family to the [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Heraclius]], who, following the end of the [[Byzantine<U+2013>Sasanian War of 602<U+2013>628]], resided with his court in northern [[Mesopotamia]]. According to the Armenian chronicler [[Sebeos]], Heraclius welcomed him with great honours, gave him valuable gifts and "exalted him above all the [[patrikios|patricians]] of his kingdom".<ref name="PLRE"/> In 635 or 637, however, Varaztirots became involved in a conspiracy by several Armenian magnates to overthrow and murder Heraclius and replace him with his son, [[John Athalarichos]]. The conspiracy was uncovered, and Varaztirots was exiled to [[exarchate of Africa|Africa]]; the treatment he received was more merciful than that of his co-conspirators as he had opposed the murder of the emperor.<ref name="PLRE"/>

On his death-bed in 641, Heraclius pardoned Varaztrots and made his successor, [[Constantine III (Byzantine emperor)|Constantine III]], swear that he would recall him and his family from exile and restore their honours. In the event, Varaztirots was recalled only in 645/6, by [[Constans II]] at the urging of [[Theodore Rshtuni]]. Varaztirots quickly fled from Constantinople to Armenia, but after assurances of loyalty, Constans then appointed him governor of Armenia with the high rank of ''[[curopalates]]''. Before he could be formally invested, however, he fell ill and died. He was buried next to his father at Darionkh.<ref name="PLRE"/>
