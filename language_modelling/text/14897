'''Sustainability''' is the capacity to endure. In [[ecology]], the word describes how biological systems remain [[biodiversity|diverse]] and productive over time. Long-lived and healthy [[wetlands]] and [[forests]] are examples of sustainable biological systems. For humans, sustainability is the potential for long-term maintenance of well being, which has environmental, economic, and social dimensions.

Healthy ecosystems and environments provide vital goods and services to humans and other organisms. There are two major ways of reducing negative human impact and enhancing [[ecosystem services]]. The first is [[environmental management]]; this approach is based largely on information gained from [[earth science]], [[environmental science]], and [[conservation biology]]. The second approach is management of human [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of resources, which is based largely on information gained from [[economics]]. 

Sustainability interfaces with economics through the social and ecological consequences of economic activity. Sustainability economics involves ecological economics where social, cultural, health-related and monetary/financial aspects are integrated. Moving towards sustainability is also a social challenge that entails [[international law|international]] and national [[law]], [[urban planning]] and [[transport]], local and individual [[lifestyles]] and [[ethical consumerism]]. Ways of living more sustainably can take many forms from reorganising living conditions (e.g., [[ecovillages]], [[eco-municipalities]] and [[sustainable cities]]), reappraising economic sectors ([[permaculture]], [[green building]], [[sustainable agriculture]]), or work practices ([[sustainable architecture]]), using science to develop new technologies ([[green technologies]], [[renewable energy]]), to adjustments in individual [[lifestyles]] that conserve natural resources.

The word sustainability is derived from the Latin ''sustinere'' (''tenere'', to hold; ''sus'', up). Dictionaries provide more than ten meanings for ''sustain'', the main ones being to <U+201C>maintain", "support", or "endure<U+201D>.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sustain Dictionary.com]</ref><ref>Onions, Charles, T. (ed) (1964). ''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''.

==History==
{{Main|History of sustainability}}

The history of sustainability traces human-dominated [[Ecology|ecological]] systems from the earliest [[civilization]]s to the present. This history is characterized by the increased regional success of a particular [[society]], followed by crises that were either resolved, producing sustainability, or not, leading to [[Human_extinction#Environmental_collapses|decline]].<ref>Beddoea, R., Costanzaa, R., Farleya, J., Garza, E., Kent, J., Kubiszewski, I., Martinez, L., McCowen, T., Murphy, K., Myers, N., Ogden, Z., Stapleton, K., and Woodward, J.

==Principles and concepts==
The philosophical and analytic framework of sustainability draws on and connects with many different disciplines and fields; in recent years an area that has come to be called [[sustainability science]] has emerged.  Sustainability science is not yet an autonomous field or discipline of its own, and has tended to be problem-driven and oriented towards guiding decision-making.<ref>[http://www.pnas.org/content/100/14/8059.full William C. Clark, Nancy M. Dickson, "Sustainability science: The emerging research program", ''PNAS'', Vol. 100, No. 14, June 6, 2003.]</ref>

===Scale and context===
Sustainability is studied and managed over many scales (levels or frames of reference) of time and space and in many contexts of environmental, social and economic organization. The focus ranges from the total [[carrying capacity]] (sustainability) of planet Earth to the sustainability of economic sectors, ecosystems, countries, municipalities, neighbourhoods, home gardens, individual lives, individual goods and services, occupations, lifestyles, behaviour patterns and so on. In short, it can entail the full compass of biological and human activity or any part of it.<ref>Conceptual Framework Working Group of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. (2003). "Ecosystems and Human Well-being." London: Island Press. Chapter 5. "Dealing with Scale". pp. 107<U+2013>124. ISBN 155634030.</ref> As Daniel Botkin, author and environmentalist, has stated: "We see a landscape that is always in flux, changing over many scales of time and space."<ref>Botkin (1990).</ref>

===Consumption <U+2014> population, technology, resources===
The overall driver of human impact on Earth systems is the destruction of [[biophysical]] [[resources]], and especially, the Earth's ecosystems.  The total environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and the scale of the human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.<ref>Clark (2006).</ref><ref name=Brower>Brower & Leon (1999).</ref>

One of the initial attempts to express human impact mathematically was developed in the 1970s and is called the [[I PAT]]  formula.  This formulation attempts to explain human consumption in terms of three components: [[population]] numbers, levels of consumption (which it terms "affluence", although the usage is different), and impact per unit of resource use (which is termed "technology", because this impact depends on the [[technology]] used).  The equation is expressed:

:::::::: I = P <U+00D7> A <U+00D7> T

::: Where: I = Environmental impact, P = Population, A = Affluence, T = Technology<ref name=Ehrlich&Holden>Ehrlich, P.R. & Holden, J.P. (1974). "Human Population and the global environment." ''American Scientist'' '''62'''(3): 282<U+2013>292.</ref>

==Measurement==
{{Main|Sustainability measurement}}
Sustainability measurement is a term that denotes the measurements used as the quantitative basis for the informed management of sustainability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.accaglobal.com/publicinterest/activities/research/reports/sustainable_and_transparent/rr-078 |title=Sustainability Accounting in UK Local Government |publisher=The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants |accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref>  The metrics used for the measurement of sustainability (involving the sustainability of environmental, social and economic domains, both individually and in various combinations) are still evolving: they include [[Ecological indicator|indicator]]s, benchmarks, audits, indexes and accounting,  as well as assessment, appraisal<ref>Dalal-Clayton, Barry and Sadler, Barry 2009. ''Sustainability Appraisal. A Sourcebook and Reference Guide to International Experience.'' London: Earthscan. ISBN 978-1-84407-357-3.</ref> and other reporting systems. They are applied over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.<ref>Hak, T. ''et al''. 2007. ''Sustainability Indicators'', SCOPE 67.

Some of the best known and most widely used sustainability measures include corporate [[sustainability reporting]], [[Triple bottom line|Triple Bottom Line accounting]], and estimates of the quality of sustainability governance for individual countries using the [[Environmental Sustainability Index]] and [[Environmental Performance Index]].

According to the 2008 Revision of the official United Nations population estimates and projections, the [[world population]] is projected to reach 7 billion early in 2012, up from the current 6.9 billion (May 2009), to exceed 9 billion people by 2050. Most of the increase will be in [[Developing country|developing countries]] whose population is projected to rise from 5.6 billion in 2009 to 7.9 billion in 2050. This increase will be distributed among the population aged 15<U+2013>59 (1.2 billion) and 60 or over (1.1 billion) because the number of children under age 15 in developing countries is predicted to decrease. In contrast, the population of the more [[Developed country|developed regions]] is expected to undergo only slight increase from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion, and this would have declined to 1.15 billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries, which is expected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050.<ref>United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2009).

More and more data are indicating that humans are not living within the [[carrying capacity]] of the planet. The [[Ecological footprint]] measures human consumption in terms of the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources, and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen. In 2008 it required 2.7 [[global hectare]]s per person, 30% more than the natural biological capacity of 2.1 global hectares (assuming no provision for other organisms).<ref name="LPR"/> The resulting ecological deficit must be met from unsustainable ''extra'' sources and these are obtained in three ways: embedded in the goods and services of world trade; taken from the past (e.g. [[fossil fuels]]); or borrowed from the future as unsustainable resource usage (e.g. by [[Overexploitation|over exploiting]] [[Forests#Forest management and forest loss|forests]] and [[fisheries management|fisheries]]).

The figure (right) compares the sustainability of countries by contrasting their Ecological Footprint with their UN [[Human Development Index]] (a measure of standard of living). The graph shows what is necessary for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while, at the same time, maintaining sustainable resource use. The general trend is for higher standards of living to become less sustainable. As always, [[population growth]] has a marked influence on levels of consumption and the efficiency of resource use.<ref name="Ehrlich&Holden"/><ref>Adams & Jeanrenaud (2008) p. 45.</ref> The sustainability goal is to raise the global standard of living without increasing the use of resources beyond globally sustainable levels; that is, to not exceed "one planet" consumption.

===Global human impact on biodiversity===
{{See|Millennium Ecosystem Assessment}}
At a fundamental level [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flow]] and [[biogeochemical cycle|biogeochemical cycling]] set an upper limit on the number and mass of organisms in any ecosystem.<ref>Krebs (2001) p. 513.</ref> Human impacts on the Earth are demonstrated in a general way through detrimental changes in the global biogeochemical cycles of chemicals that are critical to life, most notably those of [[water]], [[oxygen]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]].<ref>Smil (2000)</ref>

The ''Millennium Ecosystem Assessment'' is an international synthesis by over 1000 of the world's leading biological scientists that analyses the state of the Earth<U+2019>s [[ecosystem]]s and provides summaries and guidelines for decision-makers. It concludes that human activity is having a significant and escalating impact on the [[biodiversity]] of world [[ecosystems]], reducing both their [[ecosystem resilience|resilience]] and [[natural capital|biocapacity]]. The report refers to natural systems as humanity's "life-support system", providing essential "[[ecosystem services]]". The assessment measures 24 ecosystem services concluding that only four have shown improvement over the last 50 years, 15 are in serious decline, and five are in a precarious condition.<ref>Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, pp. 6<U+2013>19.</ref>

==Environmental dimension==
Healthy ecosystems provide vital goods and services to humans and other organisms. There are two major ways of reducing negative human impact and enhancing [[ecosystem services]] and the first of these is [[environmental management]]. This direct approach is based largely on information gained from [[earth science]], [[environmental science]] and [[conservation biology]].
However, this is management at the end of a long series of indirect causal factors that are initiated by human [[consumption (economics)|consumption]], so a second approach is through demand management of human resource use.

Management of human [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of resources is an indirect approach based largely on information gained from [[economics]]. Herman Daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability: renewable resources should provide a sustainable yield (the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration); for non-renewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes; waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment.<ref>Daly H.E. (1990). "Toward some operational principles of sustainable development." ''Ecological Economics '''''2''': 1<U+2013>6.</ref>

===Environmental management===
{{Main|Sustainability and environmental management}}
At the global scale and in the broadest sense environmental management involves the [[ocean]]s, [[freshwater]] systems, [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]] and [[atmosphere]], but following the sustainability principle of scale it can be equally applied to any ecosystem from a tropical rainforest to a home garden.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.economics.noaa.gov/?goal=ecosystems&file=users/|title=The Economics and Social Benefits of NOAA Ecosystems Data and Products  Table of Contents  Data Users|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref><ref>Buchenrieder, G., und A.R.

====Atmosphere====
In March 2009 at a meeting of the [[Copenhagen Climate Council]], 2,500 climate experts from 80 countries issued a keynote statement that there is now "no excuse" for failing to act on global warming and that without strong carbon reduction targets "abrupt or irreversible" shifts in climate may occur that "will be very difficult for contemporary societies to cope with".<ref>University of Copenhagen (March 2009) [http://climatecongress.ku.dk/newsroom/congress_key_messages/ "Key Messages from the Congress"] News item on Copenhagen Climate Congress in March 2009.

Other human impacts on the atmosphere include the [[air pollution]] in cities, the [[pollutants]] including toxic chemicals like [[nitrogen oxides]], [[Sulfur dioxide|sulphur oxides]], [[volatile organic compounds]] and [[particulate matter]] that produce [[photochemical smog]] and [[acid rain]], and the [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s that degrade the [[ozone layer]]. [[Anthropogenic]] [[particulates]] such as sulphate [[aerosol]]s in the atmosphere reduce the direct [[irradiance]] and reflectance ([[albedo]]) of the [[Earth]]'s surface. Known as [[global dimming]], the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global [[water cycle]] by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a [[Thermal energy|cooling]] effect and this may have partially masked the effect of [[greenhouse gases]] on [[global warming]].<ref>Hegerl, G.C. ''et al''. (2007).

====Freshwater and Oceans====
Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is the salty water of the [[ocean]]s and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the [[Antarctic ice sheet]]. The remaining freshwater is found in glaciers, lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers and atmosphere. Due to the water cycle, fresh water supply is continually replenished by precipitation, however there is still a limited amount necessitating management of this resource. Awareness of the global importance of preserving [[water]] for [[ecosystem services]] has only recently emerged as, during the 20th century, more than half the world<U+2019>s [[wetlands]] have been lost along with their valuable environmental services. Increasing [[urbanization]] pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe [[water]].<ref name="Atlas">Clarke & King (2006) pp.&nbsp;20<U+2013>21.</ref> Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue (harvestable) and green (soil water available for plant use) water, and this applies at all scales of water management.<ref name="water">Hoekstra, A.Y.

====Land use====
[[File:Rice Field.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A farmer working in a rice paddy|A rice paddy. Rice, wheat, corn and potatoes make up more than half the world's food supply.]]

Loss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as [[natural capital]] is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to the operations of the [[biosphere]] because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to [[urbanisation]], [[agriculture]], [[forest]], [[woodland]], [[grassland]] and [[pasture]] have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems.<ref>Krebs (2001) pp. 560<U+2013>582.</ref> At the local human scale, major sustainability benefits accrue from [[sustainable gardening|sustainable parks and gardens]] and [[green cities]].<ref>[http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G6220 Organic Gardening Techniques], ''Missouri University Extension''.

Consumption of goods and services can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy.<ref>Jackson, T. & Michaelis, L.

The ideas of [[embodied energy|embodied]] resource use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), [[resource intensity]], and [[resource productivity]] are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption.

[[File:Genomics GTL Program Payoffs.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Diagram showing the flow of CO<sub>2</sub> in an ecosystem|Flow of CO<sub>2</sub> in an [[ecosystem]]]]
The Sun's energy, stored by plants ([[primary producer]]s) during [[photosynthesis]], passes through the food chain to other organisms to ultimately power all living processes. Since the [[industrial revolution]] the concentrated energy of the [[Sun]] stored in fossilized plants as [[fossil fuel]]s has been a major driver of [[technology]] which, in turn, has been the source of both economic and political power. In 2007 climate scientists of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] concluded that there was at least a 90% probability that atmospheric increase in CO<sub>2</sub> was human-induced, mostly as a result of fossil fuel emissions but, to a lesser extent from changes in land use. Stabilizing the world<U+2019>s climate will require high-income countries to reduce their emissions by 60<U+2013>90% over 2006 levels by 2050 which should hold CO<sub>2</sub> levels at 450<U+2013>650&nbsp;ppm from current levels of about 380&nbsp;ppm.

====Water====
{{See|Water resources}}

[[Water security]] and [[food security]] are inextricably linked. In the decade 1951<U+2013>60 human water withdrawals were four times greater than the previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the [[economy]] <U+2013> especially the increase in irrigated land, growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive [[dam]] construction on all continents. This altered the [[water cycle]] of [[river]]s and [[lake]]s, affected their [[water quality]] and had a significant impact on the [[water cycle|global water cycle]].<ref name="Shik" /> Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if [[climate change]] impacts become more severe, [[population]]s increase, aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary.<ref>Clarke & King (2006) pp. 22<U+2013>23.</ref>  From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled - agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%.<ref>Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, pp. 51<U+2013>53.</ref>  In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40<U+2013>50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for [[agriculture]], 22% for [[industry]], and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing.<ref name="Shik">Shiklamov, I.

Water efficiency is being improved on a global scale by increased [[demand management]], improved infrastructure, improved water [[resource productivity|productivity]] of agriculture, minimising the water intensity (embodied water) of goods and services, addressing shortages in the non-industrialised world, concentrating food production in areas of high productivity, and planning for [[climate change]].

The International Journal of Knowledge, Culture and Change Management,9(11): p. 1-12.</ref>
At present, the average per capita consumption of people in the developing world is sustainable but population numbers are increasing and individuals are aspiring to high-consumption Western lifestyles. The developed world population is only increasing slightly but consumption levels are unsustainable. The challenge for sustainability is to curb and manage Western consumption while raising the standard of living of the developing world without increasing its resource use and environmental impact. This must be done by using strategies and technology that break the link between, on the one hand, economic growth and on the other, environmental damage and resource depletion.<ref>Ruffing, K. (2007). "Indicators to Measure Decoupling of Environmental Pressure from Economic Growth." In: Hak ''et al''. (2007) pp. 211<U+2013>222.</ref>

In addressing this issue several key areas have been targeted for economic analysis and reform: the environmental effects of unconstrained economic growth; the consequences of nature being treated as an economic externality; and the possibility of an economics that takes greater account of the social and environmental consequences of market behaviour.<ref>Hawken ''et al''. (1999).</ref>

===Decoupling environmental degradation and economic growth===
{{See|Ecological economics}}
[[File:Recycling symbol.svg|120px|thumb|right|alt=The International Recycle Symbol|International Recycle Symbol]]
Historically there has been a close correlation between [[economic growth]] and [[environmental degradation]]: as communities grow, so the environment declines. This trend is clearly demonstrated on graphs of human population numbers, economic growth, and environmental indicators.<ref>Adams & Jeanrenaud (2008) p. 15.</ref>
Unsustainable economic growth has been starkly compared to the malignant growth of a cancer<ref>Abbey, E. (1968). ''Desert Solitaire''. New York: Ballantine Books, Random House. ISBN 0345326490. Actual quote from novel is: ''growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell''</ref> because it eats away at the Earth's [[ecosystem services]] which are its life-support system.

{{See|Ecosystem services}}
The economic importance of nature is indicated by the use of the expression [[ecosystem services]] to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free.<ref name = Tragedy>Hardin, G. (December 1968). [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/162/3859/1243 "The Tragedy of the Commons."] ''Science'' '''162(3859)''', 1243<U+2013>1248. Retrieved on: 2009-03-17.</ref>
In general, as a [[commodity]] or service becomes more scarce the [[price]] increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality, technical innovation and alternative products. However, this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system.<ref>Nemetz, P.N. (2003). "Basic Concepts of Sustainable Development for Business Students."  ''Journal of International Business Education''  '''1(1)'''.</ref> As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic [[externalities]] they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded, a situation sometimes referred to as the [[Tragedy of the Commons]].<ref name = Tragedy/>

One approach to this dilemma has been the attempt to "internalise"  these "externalities" by using market strategies like [[ecotaxes]] and incentives, tradeable permits for carbon, and the encouragement of payment for ecosystem services.  [[Community currencies]] associated with [[Local Exchange Trading Systems]] (LETS), a [[gift economy]] and [[Time Banking]] have also been promoted as a way of supporting local economies and the environment.<ref>[http://www.elecan.net/docs/moned/ccto.pdf Robert Costanza ''et al''., "Complementary Currencies as a Method to Improve Local Sustainable Economic Welfare", University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, December 12th, 2003.]</ref><ref>[http://www.uea.ac.uk/env/cserge/events/grassroots/boyle.pdf David Boyle, "Sustainability and social assets: the potential of time banks and co-production", ''Grassroots Initiatives for Sustainable Development'', June 10, 2005.]</ref>  [[Green economics]] is another market-based attempt to address issues of equity and the environment.<ref>Scott Cato, M.

The global recession and a range of associated government policies are likely to bring the biggest annual fall in the world's carbon dioxide emissions in 40 years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8267475.stm|title=Recession and policies cut carbon |last=Black|first=Richard|date=21 September 2009|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref>

===Economic opportunity===
Treating the environment as an externality may generate short-term profit at the expense of sustainability.<ref>Kinsley, M. (1977).

This may lead to increased market share due to an improved public image.<ref>Jackson, T. (February 2008).

The idea of sustainability as a business opportunity has led to the formation of organizations such as the Sustainability Consortium of the [[Society for Organizational Learning]], the Sustainable Business Institute, and the World Council for Sustainable Development.<ref>See, for example: Zhexembayeva, N.

==Social dimension==
{{See|Social sustainability}}

Sustainability issues are generally expressed in [[science|scientific]] and environmental terms, but implementing change is a social challenge that entails, among other things, [[international law|international]] and national [[law]], [[urban planning]] and [[transport]], local and individual [[lifestyles]] and [[ethical consumerism]].<ref>[[Agenda 21]] "Declaration of the 1992 Rio Conference on Environment and Development." Retrieved on: 2009-03-16.</ref> "The relationship between human rights and human development, corporate power and environmental justice, global poverty and citizen action, suggest that responsible global citizenship is an inescapable element of what may at first glance seem to be simply matters of personal consumer and moral choice."<ref name = Blewitt2008,96>Blewitt (2008) p. 96.</ref>

===Peace, security, social justice===
{{See|Peace|Social justice}}
Social disruptions like [[war]], [[crime]] and [[Political corruption|corruption]] divert resources from areas of greatest human need, damage the capacity of societies to plan for the future, and generally threaten human well-being and the environment.<ref name = Blewitt2008,96/> Broad-based strategies for more sustainable social systems include: improved education and the political empowerment of women, especially in developing countries; greater regard for social justice, notably equity between rich and poor both within and between countries; and intergenerational equity.<ref name=Cohen2006/> Depletion of natural resources including fresh water<ref>[http://www.grida.no/publications/vg/water2/page/3260.aspx "Water and Political Conflicts"] from [[United Nations Environment Programme]] 2008 [http://www.unep.org/dewa/vitalwater/ "Vital Water Graphics"] Retrieved on: 2009-03-16.</ref> increases the likelihood of <U+201C>resource wars<U+201D>.<ref>Billon, P.

===Human relationship to nature===
According to [[Murray Bookchin]], the idea that humans must dominate nature is common in [[social hierarchy|hierarchical]] societies. Bookchin contends that [[capitalism]] and [[market]] relationships, if unchecked, have the capacity to reduce the planet to a mere resource to be exploited. Nature is thus treated as a [[commodity]]: <U+201C>The plundering of the human spirit by the market place is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital.<U+201D><ref>Bookchin (2004) pp. 24<U+2013>25.</ref> Still more basically, Bookchin argued that most of the activities that consume energy and destroy the environment are senseless because they contribute little to quality of life and well being. The function of work is to legitimize, even create, hierarchy. For this reason understanding the transformation of organic into hierarchical societies is crucial to finding a way forward.<ref>Bookchin (2005)</ref>

[[Social ecology]], founded by Bookchin, is based on the conviction that nearly all of humanity's present ecological problems originate in, indeed are mere symptoms of, dysfunctional social arrangements. Whereas most authors proceed as if our ecological problems can be fixed by implementing recommendations which stem from physical, biological, economic etc., studies, Bookchin's claim is that these problems can only be resolved by understanding the underlying social processes and intervening in those processes by applying the concepts and methods of the social sciences.<ref>Bookchin (2007) p. 19.</ref>

[[Deep ecology]] establishes principles for the well-being of all life on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms. This is only compatible with a substantial decrease of the human population and the end of human interference with the nonhuman world. To achieve this, deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic, technological, and ideological structures that will improve the ''[[quality of life]]'' rather than the ''[[standard of living]]''. Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen.<ref>Devall & Sessions (1985) p. 70.</ref>

One approach to [[sustainable living]], exemplified by small-scale urban [[Transition Towns|transition towns]] and rural [[ecovillages]], seeks to create self-reliant communities based on principles of [[simple living]], which maximise [[self-sufficiency]] particularly in food production. These principles, on a broader scale, underpin the concept of a [[bioregionalism|bioregional]] economy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vtcommons.org/journal/2006/02/kirkpatrick-sale-economics-scale-vs-scale-economics-towards-basic-principles-bioregi|title=Economics of Scale vs. the Scale of Economics - Towards Basic Principles of a Bioregional Economy|last=Sale|first=Kirkpatrick|date=24 February 2006|publisher=Vermont Commons|accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref> Other approaches, loosely based around [[new urbanism]], are successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve [[sustainable cities]] which support [[sustainable transport]]. Residents in compact urban neighbourhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures, compared with those living in [[urban sprawl|sprawling]] suburbs.<ref>Ewing, R [http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html "Growing Cooler - the Evidence on Urban Development and Climate Change"]. Retrieved on: 2009-03-16.</ref>

Ultimately, the degree of human progress towards sustainability will depend on large scale [[social movements]] which influence both community choices and the built environment. [[Eco-municipality|Eco-municipalities]] may be one such movement.<ref>LaColla, T. [http://www.theplanningcommission.org/newsletter/year/issues2007/summer-2007/it2019s-easy-to-be-green-eco-municipalities-here-to-stay.html "It<U+2019>s Easy to be Green!
