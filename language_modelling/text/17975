'''Josep Llu<U+00ED>s Sert i L<U+00F3>pez''' ({{IPA-ca|<U+0292>u<U+02C8>z<U+025B>b <U+028E>u<U+02C8>is <U+02C8>s<U+025B>rt}}) (1902 in [[Barcelona]] <U+2014> March 15, 1983 in [[Barcelona]]) was a Spanish [[Catalonia|Catalan]] architect and [[city planner]].

== Biography ==
Born in [[Barcelona]], he showed keen interest in the works of his painter uncle [[Josep Maria Sert]] and of [[Antoni Gaud<U+00ED>|Gaud<U+00ED>]]. He studied architecture at the Escola Superior d'Arquitectura in Barcelona and set up his own studio in 1929. That same year he shifted to Paris, in response to an invitation from [[Le Corbusier]] to work for him (without payment). Returning to Barcelona in 1930, he continued his practice there until 1937. During the 1930s, he co-founded the group GATCPAC (''Grup d'Artistes i T<U+00E8>cnics Catalans per al Progr<U+00E9>s de l'Arquitectura Contempor<U+00E0>nia'', i.e. Group of Catalan Artists and Technicians for the Progress of Contemporary Architecture), which later became, with the addition of the western and north groups, the [[GATEPAC]] (Grupo de Artistas y T<U+00E9>cnicos Espa<U+00F1>oles para el Progreso de l'Arquitectura Contempor<U+00E1>nea), which was in turn the Spanish branch of the ''[[Congr<U+00E8>s International d'Architecture Moderne]]'' (CIAM). Some time later, he became President of CIAM (1947<U+2013>56). He created several outstanding pieces of modern architecture during this period, such as the week-end house at Garraf, Catalonia, Spain (1935), the Central Dispensary of Barcelona (1935) and the Master Plan for the City of Barcelona (1933<U+2013>35). From 1937 through 1939 he lived in Paris, where he designed the Spanish Republic's pavilion at the World's Fair, the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|Paris Exposition of 1937]]. The Spanish Pavilion was built right beside the Nazi Germany Pavilion, while in Spain the Civil War was going on and the Nazis had just bombed the town of Guernica. For the artistic content of the building, Sert called on his Spanish artist friends [[Picasso]], [[Joan Mir<U+00F3>|Mir<U+00F3>]], and [[Alexander Calder|Calder]]; Picasso's contribution was [[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]] and became the focal attraction of Sert's design.<ref>Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).

=== Career in the United States ===

In 1939 Sert went into exile in [[New York City]] where he worked with the Town Planning Associates, carrying out numerous urban plans for cities in [[South America]].

In 1952, Sert held a one-year Visiting Professorship at [[Yale University]]. The following year he became Dean of the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] (1953<U+2013>1969). There, he initiated the world's first degree program in [[urban design]];<ref>[http://conferences.gsd.harvard.edu/sert/html_files/biography.html ''Josep Lluis Sert: The Architect of Urban Design.''] Exhibition and symposium announcement. 2003. Accessed 22 December 2007.</ref> integrated the programs of architecture, planning, landscape and urban design, and taught many of today's leading architects. During this period he served on the Advisory Board of the newly created [[Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts|Graham Foundation]] in Chicago, Illinois. 

In 1955, Sert founded a studio in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], which in 1958 became a partnership with Huson Jackson and Ronald Gourley. Joseph Zalewski was the Associate and continued to be in the firm Sert, Jackson and Associate founded in 1963. The studio designed many well-known projects including the [[Maeght Foundation]] (1959<U+2013>64) in southern [[France]], the Fundaci<U+00F3> Mir<U+00F3> (museum) in [[Barcelona]] (1975) and quite a few buildings for [[Harvard University]], including Holyoke Center (1958<U+2013>65), the [[Harvard Science Center]] (1969<U+2013>72), [[Peabody Terrace]] (apartments, 1962<U+2013>64), the [[Harvard Divinity School#Center for the Study of World Religions|Center for the Study of World Religions]] at the [[Harvard Divinity School]], and other buildings in the vicinity, such as a complex at [[Boston University]] including its [[Boston University School of Law|law school]], [[student activity center|student union]], and [[Mugar Memorial Library|main library]] (1960<U+2013>65), and Sert's home in Cambridge, as well as the Eastwood and Westview apartments on [[Roosevelt Island]], [[NYC]] (1976). In 1961 Sert brought [[Le Corbusier]] to the United States to design his first (and only) building there, the [[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts]] at [[Harvard]], and a gallery in the Carpenter Center is now named in Sert's honor.

===The Art World===

Josep Lluis Sert counted amongst his close friends the likes of [[Alexander Calder]], [[Joan Miro]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Mirko Basaldella]], and [[Marc Chagall]] for who he designed studios and houses. He brought art into the Harvard curriculum through his avid support for the Carpenter Center. His design for the Fondation Maeght, the Fundacion Joan Miro and the Museum School were more than an architect-client relationship, they were partnerships in the discovery of modern art.

Amongst Sert's students and colleagues in his studio are leading and past master architects from the America, Spain, France, Bolivia, and Brazil, including [[Dolf Schnebli]] of Switzerland, [[Fumihiko Maki]] of Japan, [[Christopher Charles Benninger]] of India; and many more.
