The '''Siskiyou Mountains''' are a [[Coast Ranges|coastal]] [[mountain range]] in the northern [[Klamath Mountains]] in northwestern [[California]] and southwestern [[Oregon]] in the [[United States]]. They extend in an arc for approximately 100 mi (160 km) from east of [[Crescent City, California]] northeast along the north side of the [[Klamath River]] into [[Josephine County, Oregon|Josephine]] and [[Jackson County, Oregon|Jackson]] counties in Oregon. The mountain range forms a barrier between the [[Drainage basin|watershed]]s of the Klamath River to the south and the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] to the north.

The highest peaks in the range include [[Mount Ashland|Mt. Ashland]] (elevation 7,533 ft/2,296 m), [[Dutchman Peak]] (7,410 ft/2,259 m), [[Siskiyou Peak]] (7,147 ft/2,178 m) and [[Wagner Butte]] (7,140 ft/2,176 m) all of which are in Oregon. The highest peak in the California portion of the range is [[Preston Peak]] (7,309 ft/2,228 m). Due to this high elevation and proximity to the [[Pacific Ocean]], the peaks get high precipitation (rainfall and snowfall) and thus its forests are a lush green.

[[Oregon Caves National Monument]] is located in the northern part of the range south of [[Grants Pass, Oregon]]. The [[Red Buttes Wilderness]] protects part of the range on the Oregon side of the border. Much of the range is embraced by the [[Rogue River National Forest|Rogue River]], [[Klamath National Forest|Klamath]], and [[Siskiyou National Forest|Siskiyou]] national forests. The [[Pacific Crest Trail]] follows a portion of the ridge of the range. The [[Klamath-Siskiyou forests]] are noted for their high [[biodiversity]].

== Name origins ==
The origin of the word ''siskiyou'' is not known.  One version is that it is the [[Chinook Jargon]] word for "bob-tailed horse." Another version defined "Siskiyou" as a [[Cree]] Indian name for a particular type of bob-tailed racehorse, one of which perished in 1829-1830 on [[A. R. McLeod]]'s ill-fated journey over a pass later named for the "siskiyou."  The Cree were in the area as part of McLeod's [[Hudson's Bay Company]] expedition, and had been recruited far away in their homeland in eastern Canada. Another version, given in an argument before the State Senate in [[1852]], is that the French name ''Six Cailloux'', meaning "six-stones," was given to a ford on the [[Umpqua River]] by [[Michel La Framboise]] and a party of Hudson's Bay Company company [[trapper]]s in [[1832]], because six large stones or rocks lay in the river where they crossed.  According to some, the ''Six Cailloux'' name was appropriated to this region by [[Stephen Meek]], another Hudson's Bay Company company trapper who was known for his "discovery" of [[Scott Valley]], in regard to a crossing on the [[Klamath River]] near [[Hornbrook, California|Hornbrook]].  Still others attribute the name to a local tribe of [[Native Americans (U.S.)|Native Americans]].  

== Siskiyou Pass ==
[[Interstate 5]] passes through the Siskiyous at '''Siskiyou Pass''', located just north of the Oregon/California border, and just south of [[Ashland, Oregon]].  The pass is the highest part of Interstate 5 at 4,310 ft. (1,314 m). This pass is one of the most treacherous in the Interstate highway system. The [[California]] side has a more gradual ascent/descent, but the Oregon side of the pass (the side which is more hazardous), the freeway gains (loses) 2,300 feet (701 m) in altitude over a 7-mile stretch of freeway.  In addition, the pass includes several hazardous curves, and is frequently hit with bad weather (including snow, ice, and fog) during winter storms.  During winter, the highway is frequently closed by transportation authorities due to hazardous conditions.
