== History ==
The route was established in the 1920s, when SH 3 connected [[Greeley, Colorado|Greeley]] to the [[Wyoming]] border south of [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]]. The road was paved from [[Ault, Colorado|Ault]] to its southern terminus by 1932 and was entirely paved four years later. The road was rerouted through [[Brighton, Colorado|Brighton]] and [[Denver]] by 1946. This route was deleted in 1968 and reestablished through Durango by 1982, undergoing no major  routing changes.<ref name="mesalek">{{cite web|url=http://www.mesalek.com/colo/r1-19.html#3|title=Colorado Routes 1-19|author=Salek, Matthew E.|accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>
