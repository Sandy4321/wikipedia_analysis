'''Xenon''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/<U+02C8>z<U+025B>n<U+0252>n, <U+02C8>zi<U+02D0>n<U+0252>n/}}) is a [[chemical element]] that has the symbol '''Xe''' and [[atomic number]] 54. A colorless, heavy, odorless [[noble gas]], xenon occurs in the earth's atmosphere in trace amounts. Although generally unreactive, xenon can undergo a few chemical reactions such as the formation of [[xenon hexafluoroplatinate]], the first [[noble gas compound]] to be synthesized.<ref>{{cite web

Naturally occurring xenon is made of [[Isotopes of xenon|nine stable isotopes]], but there are also over 40 unstable isotopes that undergo [[radioactive decay]]. Xenon is produced during [[supernova]] explosions and from the radioactive decay of elements such as [[iodine]], [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]]. The isotope ratios of xenon are an important tool for studying the early history of the [[Solar System]]. Xenon-135 is produced as a result of [[nuclear fission]] and acts as a [[neutron absorber]] in [[nuclear reactor]]s.

Xenon has many uses such as in xenon lamps and as a general anesthetic. The first [[excimer laser]] design used a xenon [[dimer]] molecule (Xe<sub>2</sub>) as its lasing medium, and the earliest [[laser]] designs used [[xenon flash lamp]]s as pumps. Xenon is also being used to search for hypothetical [[WIMP|weakly interactive massive particles]] and as the propellant for [[ion thruster]]s in [[spacecraft]].

== History ==
Xenon was discovered in England by [[William Ramsay]] and [[Morris Travers]] on [[July 12]], [[1898]], shortly after their discovery of the elements [[krypton]] and [[neon]]. They found it in the residue left over from evaporating components of [[liquid air]].<ref>{{cite journal

During the 1930s, the engineer [[Harold Edgerton]] began exploring strobe light technology for [[high-speed photography]]. In 1934 he pushed the time resolution down to a millionth of a second by creating an electrical spark inside a gas tube filled with xenon gas.  By this means he invented the [[xenon flash lamp]].<ref name=burke/>

Albert R. Behnke Jr. began exploring the causes of 'drunkenness' of deep-sea divers in 1939. He tested the effects of varying the breathing mixtures on his subjects, and discovered that this caused the divers to perceive a change in depth. From his results, he deduced that xenon gas could serve as an [[anesthetic]].  Although Lazharev, in Russia, apparently studied xenon anesthesia in 1941, the first published report confirming xenon anesthesia was in 1946 by J. H. Lawrence, who experimented on mice.  Xenon was first used as a surgical anesthetic in 1951 by Stuart C. Cullen, who successfully operated on two patients.<ref>{{cite journal

In 1960, the physicist [[John Reynolds|John H. Reynolds]] discovered that certain [[meteorite]]s contained an isotopic anomaly in the form of an overabundance of xenon-129. He inferred that this was a decay product of radioactive [[iodine]]-129. As the half-life of <sup>129</sup>I is
16 million years, this demonstrated that the meteorites were formed during the early history of the [[Solar System]], as the <sup>129</sup>I isotope was likely generated by one or more [[supernova]]e before the Solar System was formed.<ref>{{cite book

Xenon and the other noble gases were for a long time considered to be completely chemically inert and not able to form [[chemical compound|compound]]s.  However, in [[1962]] at the [[University of British Columbia]], the first xenon compound, [[xenon hexafluoroplatinate]], was synthesized by [[Neil Bartlett]].<ref name=beautiful>{{cite web

Xenon is obtained commercially as a byproduct of the separation of air into oxygen and nitrogen.  After this separation, generally performed by [[fractional distillation]] in a double-column plant, the liquid oxygen produced will contain small quantities of krypton and xenon.  By additional fractional distillation steps, the liquid oxygen may be enriched to contain 0.1%&ndash;0.2% of a krypton/xenon mixture, which is extracted either via adsorption onto [[silica gel]] or by distillation.  Finally, the krypton/xenon mixture may be separated into [[krypton]] and xenon via distillation.<ref>{{cite book

Because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes, xenon isotope ratios in [[meteorite]]s are a powerful tool for studying the [[formation of the solar system]]. The iodine-xenon method of [[Radiometric dating|dating]] gives the time elapsed between [[nucleosynthesis]] and the condensation of a solid object from the [[solar nebula]].

Xenon has a [[minimum alveolar concentration]] (MAC) of 0.63, making it 50% more potent than N<sub>2</sub>O as an anesthetic. Thus it can be used in concentrations with oxygen that have a lower risk of [[hypoxia]]. Unlike [[nitrous oxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O), xenon is not a [[greenhouse gas]] and so it is also viewed as environmentally friendly. Because of the high cost of xenon, however, economic application will require a closed system so that the gas can be recycled.<ref name=singh/>

When it is placed in the presence of an [[alkali]] vapor, the nucleus of the [[Spin (physics)|spin &frac12;]] isotope <sup>129</sup>Xe can be readily polarized using light from a [[Circular polarization|circularly-polarized]] laser.

(For most atoms, a [[Boltzmann distribution]] of polarized atoms is produced, resulting in detectable spins of only one in every 10<sup>5</sup> nuclei.)

At 169&nbsp;m/s, the speed of sound in xenon gas is slower than that in air<ref>169.44&nbsp;m/s in xenon (at 0&deg;&nbsp;C and 107&nbsp;KPa), compared to 344&nbsp;m/s in air. See: {{cite journal

This produces a characteristic lowered voice pitch, opposite the high-pitched voice caused by inhalation of [[helium]]. Like helium, xenon does not satisfy the body's need for oxygen and is a simple [[asphyxiant]]; consequently, many universities no longer allow the voice stunt as a general chemistry demonstration.  As xenon is expensive, the gas [[sulfur hexafluoride]], which is similar to xenon in molecular weight (146 versus 131), is generally used in this stunt, although it too is an asphyxiant.<ref>{{cite web

It is possible to safely breathe heavy gases such as xenon or sulfur hexafluoride when they include a 20% mixture of oxygen. The lungs mix the gases very effectively and rapidly, so that the heavy gases are purged along with the oxygen and do not accumulate at the bottom of the lungs.<ref>{{cite journal

Xenon is rarely used in large enough quantities for this to be a concern, though the potential for danger exists any time a tank or container of xenon is kept in an unventilated space.<ref>{{cite web
