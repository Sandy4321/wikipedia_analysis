[[Major General (Australia)|Major General]] '''Colin Hall Simpson''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Military Cross|MC]], [[Volunteer Decoration|VD]] (13 April 1894 <U+2013> 23 August 1964) was an [[Australian Army]] officer who rose to the rank of [[Major General (Australia)|major general]] as Signal Officer in Chief during the [[Second World War]]. He was one of the founders of [[Amcal]], the largest retail pharmacy chain in Australia.

Simpson joined the [[First Australian Imperial Force]] in 1916, and served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in the [[Battle of Messines]] and [[Battle of Passchendaele]]. He was twice wounded, and was [[mentioned in despatches]] and awarded the [[Military Cross]]. After the war he worked as a pharmacist, and rose to the rank of colonel in the [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]]. He transferred to the [[Royal Australian Corps of Signals|Australian Corps of Signals]] on its formation in 1925.

During the Second World War he participated in the campaigns in [[Battle of Greece|Greece]] and [[Syria<U+2013>Lebanon campaign|Syria]] as Chief Signal officer of [[I Corps (Australia)|I Corps]]. He returned to Australia in 1942 to become the Australian Army's Signal Officer in Chief. He also became the first Signal Corps officer to reach the rank of major general.

==Early life==
Colin Hall Simpson was born in [[St Kilda, Victoria]] on 13 April 1894, the son of Colin Simpson, a plumber, and his Elizabeth Fulton Simpson, n<U+00E9>e Jordan.<ref name="adb">{{Australian Dictionary of Biography   |last= Whitelaw   |first= J.   |authorlink=   |year= 202   |id2=simpson-colin-hall-11694  |title= 'Simpson, Colin Hall (1894<U+2013>1964)   |accessdate= 21 November 2011 }}</ref> He was educated at St Kilda Primary School, and, from 1911, at [[Caulfield Grammar School]]. While at Caulfield Grammar, Simpson joined the [[Australian Army Cadets]], rising to the rank of sergeant.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|pp=2<U+2013>5}} After leaving school he became an apprentice [[pharmacist]].<ref name="adb"/> He served with the [[29th Battalion (Australia)|49th (Prahran) Battalion]] in which he was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] on 1 March 1914. He became its assistant [[adjutant]] on 12 April 1915 and was promoted to [[lieutenant]] on 1 July 1915.{{sfn|Australian Army|1946}}

==First World War==
Simpson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the [[First Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) on 1 May 1916,{{sfn|Australian Army|1946}} and posted to the 3rd Pioneer Battalion,{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|pp=7<U+2013>8}}  part of the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]], which was then being raised in Australia.{{sfn|Bean|1929|p=41}} He embarked from [[Port Melbourne, Victoria|Port Melbourne]] on the transport [[HMAT Wandilla|HMAT ''Wandilla'']] on  6 June 1916, arriving in England on 26 July 1916.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|pp=7<U+2013>8}} The 3rd Division trained on the [[Salisbury Plain]] in England,{{sfn|Bean|1929|p=176}} where he was promoted to lieutenant on 13 October 1916,{{sfn|Australian Army|1946}} but was transferred to the 3rd Division Signal Company on 16 November 1916.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|pp=7<U+2013>8}} Soon after, the 3rd Division moved to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], moving into the line near [[Armenti<U+00E8>res]].{{sfn|Bean|1929|p=950}} Simpson was [[mentioned in despatches]] on 4 January 1917.<ref name="MID">{{LondonGazette|issue=29890|supp=yes|startpage=255|date=4 January 1917 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref>

The 3rd Division carried out its first offensive at the [[Battle of Messines]] in June 1917.{{sfn|Bean|1933|pp=576, 588}} For his part in the battle, Simpson was awarded the [[Military Cross]]. His citation read: {{quote|For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He organised the Brigade Signal Service so thoroughly that communication was maintained with every unit throughout. He was continually under shell-fire, but personally supervised all repairs, by his vigorous and cheerful manner impressing all ranks in the highest degree.<ref name="MC">{{LondonGazette|issue=30251|supp=yes|startpage=8825|date=25 August 1917 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref>}}

Simpson participated in the [[Battle of Passchendale]] where he was gassed and wounded for the second time. He was evacuated to England on 22 October 1917. While in hospital he applied for nine months' leave to return to Australia and complete his pharmaceutical studies. He had passed the Intermediate Examination before leaving Australia but not the Final Examination. This was granted, and he embarked for home on the transport HMAT ''Persic'' on 21 December 1917.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|pp=13<U+2013>15}} He passed the Final Examination, and was registered as a pharmacist on 10 July 1918.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|p=23}}
He never returned to the front, and his AIF appointment was terminated on 9 August 1918.<ref name="adb"/>

==Between the wars==
Simpson remained in the Army as a reservist. He was posted to the 2/14th Infantry on 1 October 1918, and was promoted to [[captain (land)|captain]] on 16 April 1920. In the post-war reorganisation of the Army, the 2/14th was absorbed into the [[14th Battalion (Australia)|14th Infantry Battalion]] in March 1921. In May, he transferred to the [[Royal Australian Engineers]] and joined the 3rd Division Signals Company. He was promoted to [[major]] on 1 July 1922, and became its commander, with the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]] on 1 September 1922.{{sfn|Australian Army|1946}} On 1 January 1925, the signal units were separated from the Engineers to form the [[Royal Australian Corps of Signals|Australian Corps of Signals]],{{sfn|McNichol|1982|p=10}} and he was transferred to the new corps. He commanded the [[39th Battalion (Australia)|39th Infantry Battalion]] from 1 July 1929 to 30 June 1933, after which he was on the unattached list for two years before resuming command of the 3rd Division Signals Company. On 1 May 1939, he assumed command of the [[6th Brigade (Australia)|6th Infantry Brigade]], with the temporary rank of [[colonel]].{{sfn|Australian Army|1946}}

Simpson opened his own chemist shop in [[Brunswick West]] in 1918.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|p=23}} On 12 August 1919 he married Jean Elizabeth Watson at the Congregational Church in [[Ascot Vale, Victoria]]. Their marriage produced two children, a son who died in infancy and a daughter, Jean Marjorie. One of the witnesses at their wedding ceremony was a fellow Militia officer, [[Alan Ramsay]], who would later marry Jean's sister Edna.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|p=161}} In 1937, Simpson banded together with D. E. Robertson and A. E. Moore to create the Allied Master Chemists of Australia Ltd, today better known as [[Amcal]].<ref name="adb"/> The idea was to join together to compete against the growing market power of major retailers. The business grew from 12 members in 1937 to over 100 by 1946.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|p=23}} Today Amcal is the largest retail pharmacy chain in Australia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amcal.com.au/about-amcal/ |title=About Amcal |accessdate=23 November 2011 |publisher=[[Amcal]]}}</ref>

==Second World War==
===Middle East===
Simpson joined the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] on 15 October 1939 with the rank of lieutenant colonel.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|p=27}} He was allocated the AIF [[service number]] VX79,{{sfn|Long|1952|pp=84<U+2013>85}} and assumed command of the Australian Corps Signals. When the [[I Corps (Australia)|I Corps]] was formed in April 1940, [[Lieutenant General (Australia)|Lieutenant General]] Sir [[Thomas Blamey]] was appointed its commander, and Simpson its Chief Signals Officer, with a promotion to the rank of colonel.{{sfn|Long|1952|pp=84<U+2013>85}}

[[File:Simpson Akin 064497.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Simpson (right) with Major General Spencer B. Akin (left), the Chief Signal Officer at GHQ|alt=Two men in uniforms without hats chatting with each other]]
Simpson embarked on the transport ''Nieuw Holland'' on 15 September 1940, arriving in [[Al Qantarah El Sharqiyya|Kantara, Egypt]] on 12 October. He met with his British counterparts, and discussed arrangements for the creation of an AIF Signals School in the Middle East. Some negotiation was required before this proposal was finally accepted. He was disappointed at the standard of training that had been achieved by the I Corps and [[6th Division (Australia)|6th Division]] signals units in the Middle East. Nor were reinforcements arriving from Australia any better. Both the standard of training of the units and the establishment of the schools intended to remedy the situation were hampered by a serious shortage of equipment.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|pp=29<U+2013>33}} The 6th Division's list of critical shortfalls<U+2014>by no means restricted to signals equipment<U+2014>included 120 telephones and  {{convert|120|mi}} of electrical cable.{{sfn|Long|1952|p=100}} Not until January 1941<U+2014>after the 6th Division had been committed to battle in Libya<U+2014>did the cable become available in Australia.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|p=34}} Some units equipped themselves with captured enemy materiel.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|p=42}}

Simpson arrived in Greece on 7 March 1941 as part of the I Corps advance party.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|p=37}} The [[Battle of Greece]] presented a major challenge for Simpson's signals units, as rugged terrain, enemy action and frequent troop movements conspired to frustrate their efforts to maintain reliable communications. The news that [[Yugoslavia]] had offered to surrender reached Blamey from a [[BBC]] broadcast on 15 April picked up on a receiver built into a kerosene case that Simpson had insisted that he take.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|p=40}} Much signals equipment was lost during the fighting, and some had to be destroyed following the order to evacuate Greece. Simpson embarked for Crete on {{HMS|Phoebe|43|6}} on 25 April. From there he took a [[flying boat]] to [[Alexandria]]. His first priority on arrival was arranging for the lost equipment to be replaced.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|pp=43<U+2013>44}}

The shortage of signals equipment was an important factor in the delay in committing I Corps to the [[Syria<U+2013>Lebanon campaign]] until it became clear that [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]] could not adequately control operations from his headquarters at the [[King David Hotel]] in Jerusalem. Once again, the signallers had to battle with inhospitable terrain. The hills and atmospheric conditions made reception difficult for the radio operations, and those same hills, along with shortages of cable made the linesmen's task no less difficult.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|pp=45<U+2013>47}} He was [[mentioned in dispatches]],<ref name="MID2">{{LondonGazette|issue=35396|startpage=7357|date= 26 December 1941 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> and made a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] for "maintenance of communications under difficult conditions in the Grecian campaign".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awm192/awm192-310-0424.pdf |publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]] |accessdate=26 November 2011 |title=Recommendation for Commander of the Order of the British Empire }}</ref><ref name="CBE">{{LondonGazette|issue=35396|startpage=7326 |date= 30 December 1941 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref>

Simpson was promoted to the rank of [[brigadier]] on 11 September 1941, becoming the first officer of the Australian Signal Corps to reach that rank.<ref name="adb"/> Simpson was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident on 13 September 1941, resulting in a broken collarbone, rib and finger, severe cuts, and a [[concussion]]. He was taken to the 2/1st General Hospital, and was evacuated to Australia on the hospital ship [[MS Wanganella|MS ''Wanganella'']]. He returned to the Middle East by air, arriving back on 20 January 1942.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|pp=45<U+2013>47}}

===South West Pacific===
Within days, Simpson was heading east again, taking a flying boat to [[Jakarta|Batavia]], where he joined the advance party of I Corps, and met with [[Dutch East Indies]] authorities regarding signals arrangements for the defence of Java from the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]. These were soon well in hand, but the tactical situation deteriorated to the extent that I Corps was ordered to leave Java on 21 February 1942. Simpson departed on the troop ship ''[[SS Orcades (1937)|Orcades]]'', which arrived in Adelaide on 14 March.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|pp=57<U+2013>60}}

[[File:Signals.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Signallers on duty at Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) in Melbourne|alt=Two soldiers, one male, one female, sit side by side doing paper work at a desk. They are wearing brassards and the sign behind them says: "signal master".]]
Blamey was appointed [[Commander in Chief]] of the [[Australian Military Forces]] on 27 March. He instituted a sweeping reorganisation of the Army, replacing officers with men who had experience in the Middle East. Simpson became the Signal Officer in Chief on 6 April, with the rank of [[Major General (Australia)|major general]], the first Australian Signal Corps officer to reach that rank.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|pp=64<U+2013>65}}

One of Simpson's first tasks was to confer with the Chief Signals Officer at [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s General Headquarters (GHQ) [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area]], [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Spencer B. Akin]]. The two established mechanisms to divide responsibility for the theatre's communications between the two armies, which often worked together on the same projects. An important outcome of their first meeting was the creation of the [[Central Bureau]] as a combined [[signals intelligence]] organisation. Simpson had been thinking about such an organisation while on the ''Orcades''. Blamey had an appreciation of signals intelligence from his time as Deputy Commander in Chief in the Middle East, and readily gave his support. After a slow start,  signals intelligence became an important element of the war in the South West Pacific.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|pp=60<U+2013>63, 71}}{{sfn|Horner|1982|p=227}}

Perhaps Simpson's most ambitious project was the laying of a submarine cable between [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] and New Guinea. A cable laying ship, the SS ''Mernoo'', was chartered, and two old cables that ran across the [[Bass Strait]] were lifted and re-laid across the [[Torres Strait]] in October 1943. When the land connections were completed in December 1943, it became possible to send a message all the way from Melbourne to Port Moresby.{{sfn|Mallett|2007|pp=213<U+2013>215}} Simpson, who was on an inspection tour of New Guinea, was on hand for the first message.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|pp=78<U+2013>79}} In November 1944, he visited the front in Holland, Belgium and France, returning to Australia via the United States and Canada.<ref name="Argus">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22258262 |title=Maj-Gen Simpson to Retire Next Monday. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 <U+2013> 1956)]] |location=Melbourne, Vic.  |date=7 May 1946 |accessdate=28 November 2011 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

To man his signals units, Simpson sought to obtain some 4,000 [[Australian Women's Army Service]] (AWAS) personnel.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|p=109}} Two special signal training battalions were activated to cater for them, and Simpson inspected the 2nd Signal Training Battalion (AWAS) at [[Ivanhoe Grammar School]] with Lieutenant Colonel [[Sybil Irving]] on 6 July 1942.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|pp=104<U+2013>105}} By 1945, the Signal Corps numbered some 25,000 men and women.<ref name="adb"/>

Aware that signals is usually forgotten when the signallers are doing their best work, Simpson attempted to obtain various accolades for his corps. He held ceremonial parades through Melbourne to celebrate [[VE Day]] on 10 May 1945,{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|p=96}} and [[VP Day]] on 20 August 1945.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|p=101}} He attempted to get the title "Royal" granted in recognition of its wartime service. This occurred on 10 November 1948.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|pp=87<U+2013>88}}

==Later life==
Simpson handed over the position of Signal Officer in Chief to Brigadier  A. D. Malloy on 23 May 1946.<ref name="Argus"/> He was placed on the retired list with the honorary rank of major general on 19 December 1946.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|p=130}} He served as [[Colonel Commandant]] for the Signal Corps in Southern Command from June 1958 to June 1963, and was Colonel Commandant of the corps from September 1959 to December 1960.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.vicnet.net.au/~rasigsau/mem_chap_3.HTM |title=Corps Memoranda No 3 |accessdate=28 November 2011 |publisher=Royal Australian Corps of Signals }}</ref> In 1946 he was appointed director of the [[Columbia Graphophone Company]] (Australia).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article29763058 |title=Company News |newspaper=[[Sydney morning herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=NSW  |date=29 May 1946 |accessdate=28 November 2011 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

Simpson was a keen supporter of the [[Essendon Football Club]], serving as its vice president from 1947 to 1964. He was awarded a life membership in 1957.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|p=167}}  He was elected Victorian State President of the Australian Legion of Ex Servicemen and Women in 1948. He resigned in October after a dispute with the State Council over its suspension of two members for being communists, which Simpson opposed.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|pp=171<U+2013>172}} Yet Simpson was no communist sympathiser; far from it. He organised The Association, a clandestine right wing paramilitary organisation headed by Blamey which was established to counter a possible communist coup. The Association disbanded in 1950.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|1996|pp=179<U+2013>181}}

==Death and legacy==
Simpson died of cancer in [[Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital]] on 23 August 1964. He was survived by his wife and daughter.<ref name="adb"/> He was buried in [[St Kilda General Cemetery]] after a funeral service at St Cuthbert's Church in [[Brighton, Victoria]]. His pall bearers included Lieutenant General Sir [[Edmund Herring]] and Major General Alan Ramsay.{{sfn|Stubbings|2003|pp=174<U+2013>175}}

[[Simpson Barracks]] was named in his honour in 1986. It is considered the home of the Royal Australian Corps of Signals, and contains the Defence Force School of Signals and the Royal Australian Corps of Signals Museum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.army.gov.au/rasigs/DFSS.asp |accessdate=21 November 2011 |title=DFSS <U+2013> Royal Australian Corps of Signals <U+2013> Forces Command |publisher=Australian Army }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.army.gov.au/rasigs/Corps_Museum.asp |accessdate=21 November 2011 |title=Royal Australian Corps of Signals Museum |publisher=Australian Army }}</ref>
