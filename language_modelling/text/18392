'''Columbus''' is a city in [[Lowndes County, Mississippi|Lowndes County]], [[Mississippi]], [[United States]] on the [[Tombigbee River]]. It is approximately {{convert|282|km|mi|0|sp=us}} northeast of [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], {{convert|193|km|mi|0|sp=us}} north of [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]], {{convert|102|km|mi|0|sp=us}} south of [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]], and {{convert|198|km|mi|0|sp=us}} west of [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. The population was 25,944 at the 2000 census. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Lowndes County, Mississippi|Lowndes County]]{{GR|6}} and the principal city of the Columbus Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is part of the larger [[Columbus-West Point Combined Statistical Area]].

==History==
The first record of the site of Columbus in Western history is found in the annals of the explorer [[Hernando de Soto]], who is reputed to have crossed the [[Tombigbee]] nearby on his search for [[El Dorado]].

The first trading post here was created in 1783, but there may have been European settlements predating that by a few decades in the general area of north eastern Mississippi. 

===Founding===
Columbus was founded in [[1821]] by Matthew Alexander and his dog Bigbee (duely named for the Tombigbee river). Before its incorporation, the town site was referred to informally as ''Possum Town'', which remains its nickname even today.  Columbus's existence owed to the failure of a flooded settlement across the river, [[Plymouth, Mississippi|Plymouth]], which was established in [[1817]]. The [[Plymouth Bluff]] (above the ruined settlement) is today an environmental center for [[Mississippi University for Women]]. The survivors of the flood moved to a site occupied by Thomas Moore and Dr. Gideon Lincenum. Silas McBee suggested the name ''Columbus''; in return, a small local creek bears McBee's name.<ref>Rowland, Dunbar, ed. Mississippi, Comprising Sketches of Counties, Towns, Events, Institutions, and Persons, Arranged in Cyclopedic Form, in three volumes. Vol. 2. Atlanta: Southern Historical Publishing Association, 1907, pages 134-137.</ref>

One of the first actions taken by the city's founders was to establish a public school, Franklin Academy. As the territory had achieved statehood only a year previously, Franklin thus became [[Mississippi]]'s first public school. However, this fact was not immediately recognized; early in its history, Columbus was referred to as ''Columbus, Alabama'' due to a mistaken estimate of the territorial boundary.

===Civil War and aftermath===
During the [[American Civil War]], Columbus was a hospital town. However, Columbus also had an arsenal that made gunpowder, hand guns and a few cannons. Because of this the Union tried to invade Columbus more than once but was stopped by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Many of the casualties from the [[Battle of Shiloh]] were brought there, and thousands were buried in the town's Friendship Cemetery. One of the hospitals was located at the still-operating Annunciation Catholic Church, built in 1863. The decision of a group of ladies to decorate the Union and Confederate graves with flowers together on [[May 29]], [[1866]] is credited as part of the founding of [[Memorial Day]]. (Similar ideas occurred to other groups in several other towns on the same weekend.) A poet, [[Francis Miles Finch]], happened to be in town that day and commemorated the occasion with the poem "[[The Blue and the Grey]]".

Another result of Columbus's history as a hospital town was the sparing of its [[antebellum]] homes, making its collection second only to [[Natchez]] as the most extensive in Mississippi.

===20th century===
Columbus has hosted [[Columbus Air Force Base]] (CAFB) since [[World War II]]. CAFB was founded as a flight training school. After a stint in the [[1950s]] and [[1960s]] as a [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) base (earning Columbus a spot in [[Soviet Union]] target lists), CAFB returned to its original role. Today, it is one of only four basic Air Force flight training bases in the United States, and prized as the only one where regular flight conditions may be experienced. Despite this, CAFB has repeatedly hung in the balance during [[Base Realignment and Closure]] (BRAC) hearings.

Columbus boasted a number of industries during the mid-twentieth century, including the world's largest [[toilet seat]] manufacturer, Sanderson Plumbing Products, and major mattress, furniture, and textile plants. Most of these had closed by [[2000]]. A series of new plants, capped by the proposed [[SteelCorr]] minimill, have been planned to revitalize the local economy. [[American Eurocopter]] has constructed a facility at the [[Golden Triangle Regional Airport]]. Aurora Flight Sciences is planning on locating at the Golden Triangle Regional Airport.

Columbus is the birthplace of famous playwright [[Tennessee Williams]], author of ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' and ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]''. His birthplace, formerly the rectory of nearby St. Paul's Episcopal Church, is now the welcome center for Columbus (300 Main St., Columbus). Columbus is also the birthplace of baseball announcer [[Red Barber]] and boxing's first three-time world heavyweight champion, [[Henry Armstrong]].

===Recent history===
Columbus has made the national news at least three times in the past two decades. On [[June 12]], [[1990]], a fireworks factory exploded, detonating a blast felt as far as 30 miles away from Columbus. Two workers were killed in the blast. On [[June 26]], [[2000]], the television show ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]'' did an investigative report of five murders of senior citizens occurring in an 18-month period between late 1997 and early 1999. On [[February 16]], [[2001]], straight winds measured at 74 miles per hour destroyed many homes and trees but fortunately resulted in no fatalities. The city was declared a federal disaster area the next day by [[President George W. Bush]].

==Media==
Columbus' city newspapers are the daily (except Saturdays) ''[[Commercial Dispatch]]'' and the weekly ''[[Columbus Packet]]''.  Two television stations, [[WCBI-TV]] and [[UPN-MS]], are located in the city's historic downtown area.

==Geography==
[[Image:Luxapalila Creek Columbus Mississippi.jpg|thumb|Luxapalila Creek running through the center of Columbus. View is upstream to the north.]]

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|57.8|sqkm|sqmi|1|sp=us}} &ndash; {{convert|55.5|sqkm|sqmi|1|sp=us}} of it is land and {{convert|2.3|sqkm|sqmi|1|sp=us}} of it is water.

Columbus lies on U.S. Highways [[US 82|82]] and [[US 45|45]]. It is also served by state routes [[Mississippi State Highway 12|12]], [[Mississippi State Highway 50|50]], [[Mississippi State Highway 69|69]], and [[Mississippi State Highway 182|182]]. Columbus is the eastern terminus of the [[Columbus and Greenville Railway]]; it is also served by the [[BNSF Railway]] (on the original right-of-way of the [[St. Louis - San Francisco Railway]]), the [[Norfolk Southern]], and the [[CN]] (using the original right-of-way of the [[Gulf, Mobile, and Ohio]]). The local airport is [[Golden Triangle Regional Airport]].

The city is located on the east bank of the [[Tombigbee River]] and the associated [[Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway]]. [[Columbus Lake (Mississippi)|Columbus Lake]], formed by the [[John C. Stennis Lock and Dam]], is approximately two miles north of downtown. The [[Luxapalila Creek]] runs through the town, separating East Columbus from Columbus proper (both are within city limits). The Lux, as it is locally known, joins the Tombigbee about three miles south of downtown.

The city's public high school (under the [[Columbus Municipal School District]]) is [[Columbus High School (Mississippi)|Columbus High School]], located in the eastern part of town. It is the largest high school in the city and fifth largest in the state, enrolling approximately 1370 students. Columbus High School was formed by the merger of the city's two previous high schools, [[Stephen D. Lee]] High School and Caldwell High School; the schools were merged in [[1993]] and the campuses in [[1997]]. Columbus is also home to the oldest public elementary school in Mississippi, [[Franklin Elementary (Columbus, Mississippi)|Franklin Academy Elementary]], founded in [[1821]].

Columbus also includes several private schools, the most prominent being:
* Immanuel Center for Christian Education (K-3 through 12)
