==History==
Synthetic cathinones such as [[mephedrone]] which are chemically similar to [[cathinone]], naturally found in the plant ''[[Catha edulis]]'' (khat), were first synthesised in the 1920s.<ref name=coppola/> They remained obscure until the first decade of the 21st century, when they were rediscovered by [[clandestine chemistry|underground chemists]] and began to be used in designer drugs, as the compounds were legal in many jurisdictions.<ref name=coppola/><ref name=hamilton>{{cite web|url=http://www.viceland.com/int/v17n6/htdocs/hamilton-s-pharmacopeia-455.php |title=Hamilton<U+2019>s Pharmacopeia. Mephedrone: the phantom menace |last=Morris|first=H. |publisher=Vice Magazine |date=5 April 2010|accessdate=2010-07-04}}</ref> In 2009 and 2010 there was a significant rise in the abuse of synthetic cathinones, initially in the [[United Kingdom]] and the rest of [[Europe]], and subsequently in the [[United States|US]]. Drugs marketed as "bath salts" first came to the attention of authorities in the US in 2010 after reports were made to US poison centres.<ref name=spiller/> In Europe, the drugs were predominantly purchased from [[drug dealer]]s or from websites, but in the US they were mainly sold in small independent stores such as gas stations and [[head shops]].<ref name=spiller/> Bath salts are sold in 50-milligram packets online and have their own brand names. Some of the brand names online are called "Purple Wave," "Zoom," and "Cloud Nine."<ref>{{cite web|last=Dolak|first=Kevin|title='Bath Salts': Use of Dangerous Drug Increasing Across U.S.|url=http://abcnews.go.com/health/bath-salts-dangerous-drug-increasing-us/story?id=16496076#.UXf92pW5fzL|publisher=ABC News: Good Morning America}}</ref> In the US, this often made them easier to obtain than cigarettes and alcohol.<ref name=spiller/>

Hundreds of other designer drugs or "legal highs" have been reported, including artificial chemicals such as [[synthetic cannabis]] and semi-synthetic substances such as [[methylhexaneamine]].<ref name=McElrath/> These drugs are primarily developed to avoid being controlled by laws against illegal drugs, thus giving them the label of designer drugs.<ref name=McElrath>{{cite journal | author = McElrath K, O'Neill C | title = Experiences with mephedrone pre- and post-legislative controls: perceptions of safety and sources of supply | journal = Int.

The number of calls to poison centers concerning "bath salts" rose from 304 in 2010 to 6,138 in 2011, according to the American Association of Poison Control Centers. More than 1,000 calls had been made in 2012 by June.<ref>{{cite web|title='Bath Salts': Use of Dangerous Drug Increasing Across U.S.|url=http://abcnews.go.com/health/bath-salts-dangerous-drug-increasing-us/story?id=16496076|publisher=abc News|accessdate=2012-07-22|author=Kevin Dolak|date=June 5, 2012}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
[[pharmacology|Pharmacologically]], bath salts usually contain a [[cathinone]], typically [[methylenedioxypyrovalerone]] (MDPV), [[methylone]] or [[mephedrone]]; however, the [[chemical]] composition varies widely<ref name=spiller/><ref name=prosser/> and products labeled with the same name may also contain derivatives of [[pyrovalerone]] or [[pipradrol]]. In Europe the main synthetic cathinone is mephedrone, whereas in the US MDPV is more common.<ref name=spiller/>

Very little is known about how bath salts interact with the brain and how they are [[drug metabolism|metabolised]] by the body. Scientists are inclined to believe that bath salts have a powerful addictive potential and can increase users' tolerance.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ross, M.D.|first=Edward|title=<U+201C>Bath Salts<U+201D> Intoxication|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1107097|work=The New England Journal of Medicine|accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref><ref name=coppola/> They are similar to amphetamines in that they cause stimulant effects by increasing the concentration of [[Monoamine neurotransmitter|monoamines]] such as [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]], and [[norepinephrine]] in [[synapse]]s.<ref name=coppola/><ref name=Kehr>{{cite journal|last=Kehr|first=J.|title=Mephedrone, compared to MDMA (ecstasy) and amphetamine, rapidly increases both dopamine and serotonin levels in nucleus accumbens of awake rats|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|year=2011|month=April|doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01499.x|pmid=21615721|last2=Ichinose|first2=F.|last3=Yoshitake|first3=S.|last4=Goiny|first4=M.|last5=Sievertsson|first5=T.|last6=Nyberg|first6=F.|last7=Yoshitake|first7=T.|pages=1949<U+2013>58|volume=164|issue=8|pmc=3246659}}</ref> They are generally less able to cross the [[blood brain barrier]] than amphetamines due to the presence of a [[ketone|beta-keto group]] which increases the compound's [[Chemical polarity|polarity]].<ref name=coppola/>

The effects of "bath salts" on a developing fetus are unknown. However, the use of cocaine and methamphetamine (which have effects similar to "bath salts") during pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage, premature delivery, and decreased birth weight. These newborns were also more likely to be irritable, malnourished, and suffer from sleep disturbances within the first few weeks after birth.<ref>[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hc-ps/drugs-drogues/learn-renseigne/bath_salts-sels_bain-eng.php#a5 "'Bath salts'"], Health Canada website, n.d.

==Detection==
MDPV cannot be smelled by [[detection dog]]s<ref name="CBC" /> and will not be found in typical [[urinalysis]],<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.jsat.2012.02.003}}</ref> although they can be detected in urine and hair analyses using [[gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]].<ref>R.

Users tend to range from ages 15<U+2013>55 with the average being age 28.<ref name="test">[Miller, Michael C. <U+201C>Ask the Doctor: Bath salts<U+2014>a new way to get high?<U+201D> Harvard Mental Health Letter. 2011. Retrieved 18 Aug 2012.], additional text.</ref>
