[[Image:Klamath Basin.jpg|thumb|right|Klamath Basin]]The '''Klamath Basin''' is the region in the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Oregon]] and [[California]] drained by the [[Klamath River]]. It contains most of [[Klamath County, Oregon|Klamath County]] and parts of [[Lake County, Oregon|Lake]] and [[Jackson County, Oregon|Jackson]] counties in Oregon, and parts of [[Del Norte County, California|Del Norte]], [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt]], [[Modoc County, California|Modoc]], [[Siskiyou County, California|Siskiyou]], and [[Trinity County, California|Trinity]] counties in California. The {{convert|15751|mi2|km2|adj=on}} [[drainage basin]] is 35% in Oregon and 65% in California. In Oregon, the watershed typically lies east of the Cascade Range, while California contains most of the river's segment that passes through the mountains. In the Oregon-far northern California segment of the river, the watershed is [[semi-desert]] at lower elevations and dry [[alpine]] in the upper elevations. In the western part of the basin, in California, however, the climate is more of [[temperate rainforest]], and the Trinity River watershed consists of a more typical alpine climate.

==Distribution of subwatersheds==
[[Image:KlamathBasin-location.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Klamath River watershed showing subwatershed boundaries]]
The drainage basins of the [[Williamson River (Oregon)|Williamson]] and [[Sprague River]]s, in Oregon, are to the north and northeast of Upper Klamath Lake. Together, the two watersheds cover {{convert|3069|mi2|km2}}, or 19.4% of the Klamath River watershed.<ref name=watershedmap>''Hydrology, Ecology and Fishes of the Klamath River Basin'', p.27</ref><ref name=watershedsizes>BEST and WSTB, p. 26</ref><ref name=usda>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/feature/klamath/klambasin.html|title=Klamath River Basin - Overview|publisher=www.nrcs.usda.gov|work=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]]|date=|accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref> The basin of the [[Lost River (California)|Lost River]], the largest subwatershed by area, lies to the southeast of Upper Klamath Lake and to the east of Lower Klamath Lake. This covers {{convert|3009|mi2|km2}} or 19.1% of the Klamath River watershed - nearly as much as the Williamson and Sprague. Proceeding west, the adjoining [[Butte Creek (California)|Butte Creek]], [[Shasta River|Shasta]], [[Scott River (California)|Scott]] and [[Salmon River (California)|Salmon River]] watersheds have {{convert|603|mi2|km2}}, {{convert|795|mi2|km2}}, {{convert|813|mi2|km2}}, and {{convert|750|mi2|km2}}, respectively. These account for 4.3%, 5%, 5.2%. and 5% of the Klamath River watershed, respectively, or 19.5% of the watershed if put together.<ref name=watershedmap/><ref name=watershedsizes/><ref name=usda/>

Further southwest, the watershed of the [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity River]], the second largest subwatershed of the Klamath, has {{convert|2965|mi2|km2}} or 19% of the watershed. The watershed of the [[South Fork Trinity River]] is {{convert|980|mi2|km2}} - 33% of the Trinity watershed or 6% of the Klamath watershed. The primary tributaries of the Klamath together account for 77% of the total Klamath watershed - the remaining land area is drained by smaller tributaries such as Jenny Creek, Fall Creek and Blue Creek.<ref name=watershedmap/><ref name=watershedsizes/><ref name=usda/>

==Major bodies of water==
[[Image:Lower Klamath NWR marsh and mountains.JPG|thumb|right|The Upper Klamath Basin today, showing the remnants of the vast Lake Modoc]]
Upper Klamath Lake is the largest present-day body of water in the Klamath River watershed, covering {{convert|96|mi2|km2}} on average, with a shoreline of {{convert|87|mi|km}}. It is also the largest freshwater lake in the state of Oregon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlakes.org/gallery/klamath/klamath.html|title=Klamath Lake|publisher=www.oregonlakes.org|work=Oregon Lakes Association|date=|accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref> Historically, Lower Klamath Lake and [[Tule Lake]] were one interconnected freshwater marsh that totaled {{convert|195|mi2|km2}} - more than twice the present-day dimensions of Upper Klamath Lake, and larger than [[Lake Tahoe]] in central California. This interconnected wetland still supports up to 3.7 million migrating birds per year.<ref>Blake, Blake and Kittredge, p. 1</ref> In wet years, the two lakes would connect to Upper Klamath Lake, forming one huge body of water. These lakes occupy the basin that was prehistorically occupied by [[Lake Modoc]], a {{convert|1100|mi2|km2|sing=on}} freshwater lake that covered the entire Upper Klamath Basin, or 7% of the watershed - an area three times larger than the massive [[Salton Sea]] in southern California. This lake existed up to 11,000 years ago at the end of the most recent [[ice age]].<ref name=lakes>{{cite web|last=Delong|first=Jay|url=http://www.nanfa.org/NANFAregions/or_wa/klamath/klamath.htm|title=Walking in 100-Year-Old Footsteps in Southern Oregon|publisher=www.nanfa.org|work=North American Native Fishes Association|date=|accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref> Today, Upper Klamath Lake encompasses just 0.6% of the Klamath watershed.

There are also several entirely artificial bodies of water in the watershed - including [[Lake Ewauna]], J.C. Boyle Reservoir, Copco Reservoir, and Iron Gate Reservoir on the main Klamath.<ref name="dams">{{cite web|url=http://www.yuroktribe.org/departments/fisheries/documents/GECFinalReport.pdf|title=Klamath River Dam and Sediment Investigation|publisher=www.yuroktribe.org|work=Yurok Tribe of California|date=November 2006|accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref> Lake Ewauna, also called Keno Reservoir, is {{convert|3.8|mi2|km2}} in size, and is about {{convert|20|mi|km}} long.<ref name=keno>{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificorp.com/File/File16150.pdf|title=Lake Ewauna/Keno Reservoir Reach Location and Characteristics|publisher=PacifiCorp|work=PacifiCorp Klamath Hydroelectric Project|date=|accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref> The J.C.

[[Trinity Lake]], on the mainstem of the Trinity River, is the largest tributary reservoir in the Klamath River watershed. At {{convert|25|mi2|km2}} in size, it is larger than all four mainstem Klamath reservoirs combined (excluding Upper Klamath Lake).<ref name=shasta-trinity>{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=Shasta/Trinity%20River%20Division%20Project|title=Shasta/Trinity River Division Project|publisher=www.usbr.gov|work=[[U.S. Bureau of Reclamation]]|date=|accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref>
