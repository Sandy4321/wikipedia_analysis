The '''''Minotaur'' class''' was a three-ship [[ship class|class]] of [[armoured cruiser]]s built in the first decade of the twentieth century for the [[Royal Navy]]. They initially served with the [[Home Fleet]], generally as the [[flagship]]s of [[cruiser]] [[squadron (naval)|squadron]]s. ''Minotaur'' became flagship of the [[China Station]] in 1910 and ''Defence'' served as flagship of the [[1st Cruiser Squadron]] in the Mediterranean from 1912; ''Shannon'' remained at home as flagship of several different squadrons. 

When [[World War I]] began in August 1914, ''Defence'' participated in the [[pursuit of Goeben and Breslau|pursuit of the German ships]] {{SMS|Goeben}} and {{SMS|Breslau}} and ''Minotaur'' hunted for the [[German East Asia Squadron]] and German [[commerce raider]]s in the Pacific and [[Indian Ocean]]s. ''Shannon'' remained with the [[Grand Fleet]], as the Home Fleet was renamed, for the entire war. All three were present at the [[Battle of Jutland]] in May 1916, where ''Defence'' was sunk with heavy loss of life. The surviving pair spent most of the rest of the war assigned to the [[Northern Patrol]] unsuccessfully searching for German warships and commerce raiders. They were [[ship breaking|scrapped]] after the war.

==Design and description==
[[File:Minotaur class cruiser diagrams Brasseys 1912.jpg|thumb|left|Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in [[Brassey's Naval Annual]] 1912. The shaded areas represent her armour.]]
The ''Minotaur''-class ships, the first designed by the [[Director of Naval Construction]], [[Philip Watts]], were the last armoured cruisers built for the Royal Navy. They were significantly larger and more heavily armed than their predecessors, although their armour was reduced in an attempt to compensate for the additional weight of the armament. The design was criticized for this weakness as well as the wide dispersal of the {{convert|7.5|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} turrets along the length of the ship. They have been described as "cruiser editions of the {{sclass-|Lord Nelson|battleship}}".<ref>Burt, pp. 84<U+2013>86</ref>

The ''Minotaur'' class [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|14600|LT|t}} as built and {{convert|16630|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. ''Defence'' and ''Minotaur'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|519|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|74|ft|6|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|26|ft|m|1}}. ''Shannon'' had {{convert|1|ft|m}} more beam and one foot less draught than her [[sister ship]]s to evaluate the theory that she might be faster with these proportions than her sisters. The class displaced {{convert|1050|lt}} more, was {{convert|13|ft|6|in}} longer overall, was one foot broader in beam and had more [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] than their predecessors of the {{sclass-|Duke of Edinburgh|cruiser|4}}. At normal load they had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|3.05|ft|m|1}}, and at deep load, {{convert|3.25|ft|m|1}}. The ''Minotaur''s were designed to carry 779 officers and enlisted men, but mustered 802<U+2013>842 between 1908 and 1912.<ref>Burt, pp. 84, 86, 93<U+2013>94</ref>

The ships were powered by a pair of four-cylinder [[Compound engine#Multiple expansion engines|triple-expansion steam engine]]s, each driving one shaft, which developed a total of {{convert|27000|ihp|lk=in|-1}} intended to give a maximum speed of {{convert|23|kn|lk=in}}. The engines were powered by 24 [[water-tube boiler]]s with a working pressure of {{convert|275|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}. They carried a maximum of {{convert|2060|LT|t}} of coal and an additional {{convert|750|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, the ships could steam for {{convert|8150|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. During her [[sea trial]]s on 6 December 1907, ''Minotaur'' made her designed speed when she reached 23.01 knots from {{convert|27049|ihp|abbr=on}} during her eight-hour full-power test. ''Shannon'' proved to be the slowest of the three and only reached {{convert|22.324|kn}} from {{convert|27372|ihp|abbr=on}} during her trial three days before ''Minotaur''{{'}}s.<ref>Burt, pp. 86, 94<U+2013>95</ref>

===Armament===
[[File:BL 7.5 inch Mk V guns for HMS Shannon Vickers Works LOC ggbain 19618.jpg|thumb|left|''Shannon''{{'}}s 7.5-inch guns and turrets under construction. Note the 12-pounder guns and their mounts on the turret roofs.]]
The ''Minotaur''s carried only four 50-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk IX - X|BL 9.2-inch Mk X guns]], compared to the six of the earlier ships, but the guns were mounted in twin hydraulically powered centreline turrets, which gave them the same four-gun [[broadside]] as the ''Duke of Edinburgh''s. The guns had an elevation range of <U+2212>5<U+00B0>/+15<U+00B0>. They fired {{convert|380|lb|kg|adj=on|0}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2875|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}; this provided a maximum range of {{convert|16200|yd|abbr=on|0}} with [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armour-piercing]] (AP) shells. The rate of fire of these guns was up to four rounds per minute<ref>Friedman 2011, pp. 72<U+2013>73</ref> and the ships carried 100 rounds per gun.<ref name=f6>Friedman 2012, p. 336</ref>

The secondary armament was much heavier than the older ships, with five single hydraulically powered turrets equipped with 50-calibre [[BL 7.5 inch Mk II - V naval gun|BL 7.5-inch Mk II guns]] mounted on each side. The guns could be depressed to <U+2212>7.5<U+00B0> and elevated to +15<U+00B0>. Using [[List of British ordnance terms#C.R.H.|4crh]] AP shells, they had a maximum range of {{convert|15571|yd|m|abbr=on|0}}. Their {{convert|200|lb|kg|adj=on|0}} projectiles were fired at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2841|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at four rounds per minute.<ref>Friedman 2011, p. 77</ref> Each gun was provided with 100 rounds.<ref name=f6/>

Anti-[[torpedo boat]] defence was provided by sixteen [[QF 12 pounder 18 cwt naval gun|QF 12-pounder 18-cwt guns]]. Most of these were mounted on the tops of the turrets and the remaining four in the superstructure fore and aft. They fired {{convert|3|in|adj=on}}, {{convert|12.5|lb|kg|adj=on}} projectiles at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2660|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}; this gave a maximum range of {{convert|9300|yd|m|abbr=on}} at their maximum elevation of +20<U+00B0>.<ref>Friedman 2011, pp. 112<U+2013>113</ref> They also mounted five submerged [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch]] [[torpedo tube]]s, two on each broadside, plus one mounted in the stern.<ref>Burt, p. 94</ref>

===Armour===
Armour in the ''Minotaur'' class was reduced compared to the earlier ships. The upper [[Belt armor|belt]], considered superfluous after the elimination of the main deck [[casemate]]s, was eliminated as were the transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s that connected the [[waterline]] belt to the [[barbette]]s that protected the ships from raking fire. The {{convert|6|in|0|adj=on}} waterline armour belt of [[Krupp cemented armour]] extended past the fore and aft 7.5-inch gun turrets; its lower edge was about {{convert|5|ft|m|1}} below the waterline at normal load. Forward the armour was {{convert|4|in|0}} up to about {{convert|50|ft|m|1}} from the bow when it was reduced to three inches; aft the belt armour was three inches thick all the way to the stern. In addition to this, the engine cylinders were protected by armour plates {{convert|1.5|-|2|in|mm|0}} thick.<ref>Burt, pp. 85<U+2013>86</ref>

The faces of the primary gun turrets were {{convert|8|in|0}} thick and they had {{convert|7|in|0}} sides. The face armour for the 7.5-inch turrets was also eight inches thick, but their sides were only {{convert|6|in|mm|0}} thick. The main barbettes were protected by seven inches of armour as were the ammunition hoists, although the armour for those thinned to two inches between the lower and main [[Deck (ship)|decks]]. The thickness of the lower deck ranged from 1.5 inches on the flat amidships to two inches on the slope connecting it to the lower edge of the waterline belt for the length of the ship. At the ends of the ship, the thickness of the deck armour increased to two inches. The sides of the forward [[conning tower]] were 10 inches thick<ref>Burt, p. 86</ref> while those of the rear conning tower were three inches in thickness.<ref>Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 73</ref>

===Modifications===
The funnels were raised {{convert|15|ft|m|1}} in 1909 to eliminate smoke interference with the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. During 1915<U+2013>16, a 12-pounder was fitted to the rear superstructure and a three-pounder to the [[quarterdeck]], both guns on high-angle mounts for anti-aircraft defence. In 1916, reinforcing legs were added to the foremast to support the weight of a [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control director]]; ''Shannon'' received her director that same year and ''Minotaur'' in 1917<U+2013>18. In the last year of the war, the reinforced foremast was replaced by a stronger tripod mast and the 12-pounder was moved to the top of the forward turret.<ref>Burt, p. 85</ref>

==Service==
[[File:HMS Shannon.jpg|thumb|left|Stern view of ''Shannon'', November 1915]]
The [[sister ship|sisters]] were all initially assigned to the Home Fleet upon commissioning with ''Shannon'' frequently serving as the flagship of the [[5th Cruiser Squadron|5th]], [[2nd Cruiser Squadron|2nd]] and [[3rd Cruiser Squadron]]s before reverting to the flagship of the 2nd Squadron in 1914. ''Minotaur'' became the flagship of the China Station in 1910 and she was briefly joined by ''Defence'' in 1912 before the latter was transferred to the Mediterranean at the end of the year to serve as flagship of the [[1st Cruiser Squadron]] there.<ref>Burt, p. 87, 89, 91<U+2013>92</ref>

When the war began, ''Minotaur'' searched unsuccessfully for the [[German East Asia Squadron]] in the Pacific and the commerce-raiding [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Emden|1908|2}} in the Indian Ocean before she was transferred to the Grand Fleet at the end of 1914. She became flagship of the [[7th Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|7th Cruiser Squadron]] and was assigned to the [[Northern Patrol]]. ''Defence'' participated in the pursuit of the German [[battlecruiser]] SMS ''Goeben'' and light cruiser SMS ''Breslau'', but [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear-Admiral]] [[Ernest Troubridge]] decided not to engage ''Goeben'' due to the latter's more powerful guns, heavier armour and faster speed. She then [[blockaded]] the German ships inside the [[Dardanelles]].<ref>Corbett, I, p. 65</ref> The Admiralty ordered the ship to the [[South Atlantic]] in October to join Rear-Admiral [[Christopher Cradock]]'s [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] searching for the German ships. ''Defence'', however, had only reached [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]] by 3 November when she received word that most of Admiral Cradock's squadron had been destroyed two days previously at the [[Battle of Coronel]]. The ship was then ordered to [[South Africa]] to escort a troop convoy to Great Britain. ''Defence'' departed [[Table Bay]], [[Cape Town]] in December and rejoined the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet as its flagship upon her arrival.<ref name=b1>Burt, p. 91</ref>

In early 1915, the sisters were all assigned to the Grand Fleet, each as flagship of their respective squadrons.<ref>Burt, pp. 89, 91<U+2013>92</ref> Just before the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916, the 2nd and 7th Cruiser Squadrons were combined with ''Minotaur'' as the flagship.<ref>Corbett, III, p. 426</ref> During the battle the 2nd Cruiser Squadron was unengaged and did not fire their guns.<ref>Campbell, p. 361</ref> In contrast the 1st Cruiser Squadron was engaged at close range by the German [[capital ship]]s during the battle;<ref name=m7>Marder, pp. 97<U+2013>98</ref> ''Defence'' was hit by two [[salvo]]es from the German ships that caused the aft 9.2-inch magazine to explode. The resulting fire spread via the ammunition passages to the adjacent 7.5-inch magazines which detonated in turn.<ref name=b1/><ref>Brown, p. 167</ref> The ship exploded with the loss of all men on board;<ref name=m7/> between 893 and 903 men were killed.<ref>Burt, p. 92</ref>

''Shannon'' and ''Minotaur'' were also present during the [[Action of 19 August 1916|attempted interception of the High Seas Fleet by the Grand Fleet on 19 August]] although no combat occurred. For the rest of the war, the ships were assigned to the Northern Patrol.<ref>Newbolt, IV, pp. 42, 50, 192</ref> On 11 December 1917, the sisters and four destroyers were assigned to patrol the convoy route between [[Lerwick]] and Norway, but the Germans successfully destroyed a convoy off the Norwegian coast on the following day and returned home without being spotted. The British ships were only able to rescue survivors and escort the sole surviving ship from the convoy, the crippled destroyer {{HMS|Pellew|1916|2}}, back to [[Scapa Flow]].<ref>Newbolt, V, pp. 185, 192<U+2013>93</ref>

The sisters were [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in 1919, although ''Shannon'' temporarily became a training ship before the two were sold for scrap in 1920. ''Shannon'' was not actually broken up until January 1923.<ref>Burt, pp. 89, 93</ref>
