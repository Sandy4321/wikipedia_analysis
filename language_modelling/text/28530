'''''The 39 Steps''''' was a 2008 [[United Kingdom|British]] television [[Television film|feature-length]] adaptation of the [[John Buchan]] novel ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'' produced by the [[BBC]]. The adaptation is set on the eve of [[World War I]], and sees mining engineer [[Richard Hannay]] caught up in a conspiracy following the death of a British spy in his apartment. It was written by [[Lizzie Mickery]], directed by [[James Hawes]], and starred [[Rupert Penry-Jones]], [[Lydia Leonard]], [[David Haig]], [[Eddie Marsan]] and [[Patrick Malahide]]. Following four screen versions of the novel and a [[The Three Hostages (film)|1977 television adaptation]] of ''[[The Three Hostages]]'', Penry-Jones became the fifth actor to portray Hannay on screen. It was filmed on location in [[Scotland]].

The single drama was first shown on [[BBC One]] and [[BBC HD]] on 28 December 2008 as part of BBC One's Christmas 2008 line-up, and it was the most watched programme of the day. Comparing it to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s [[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|1935 film]], it received mostly negative reviews from the press. The production was criticised for its historical inaccuracies following the use of props made after the setting for the film.

==Plot==
The story starts on 28 June 1914; [[Richard Hannay]] ([[Rupert Penry-Jones]]), a mining engineer and an intelligence officer during the [[Second Boer War]], is in London following his recent return from Africa, finding England "cliquey", "class-bound" and "deathly, deathly dull". Evading German spies ([[Werner Daehn]] and [[Peter Stark (actor)|Peter Stark]]), Scudder ([[Eddie Marsan]]) pushes himself into Hannay's apartment and reveals himself to be a betrayed freelance British [[William Melville#Secret Service Bureau|Secret Service Bureau]] agent, who has been on the trail of a German espionage ring with headquarters in Scotland. He has heard rumours of a plot to assassinate a high-ranking European royal, which could lead to war. Believing he will soon be killed, he hands Hannay a notebook to pass to [[Vernon Kell|Captain Kell]] of the Secret Service Bureau. While Hannay answers the door, Scudder is shot by one of the German spies seeking his notebook who has entered the apartment via a back door. The police arrive, and Hannay is arrested for murder before escaping.

Unable to contact Kell, Hannay flicks through the notebook, finding it contains pages of code using Roman numerals. He finds a map in the back and takes a train to Scotland to prove Scudder right, attempting to decipher the code en route. Finding out [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Ferdinand]] has been assassinated, Hannay reaches Scotland and leaves the train to escape the police. He stays in a barn overnight, where he deciphers the code in the notebook (except a section in double code), which reveals the Germans want to destroy the [[Royal Navy|British Navy]] so that they could invade the country, starting a war. Chased by the police, the Germans and machine-gun-fire from a biplane, he encounters brother and sister Harry and Victoria Sinclair, a prospective [[Member of Parliament]] and a [[suffragette]] respectively ([[Patrick Kennedy]] and [[Lydia Leonard]]), who believe him to be a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] spokesman. At a political rally in a nearby town ([[Culross]]) where Hannay meets Sir George Sinclair, Harry and Victoria's uncle ([[David Haig]]), Victoria aids Hannay's attempt to escape, before they are captured by the Germans. With the notebook missing from Hannay's pocket, they are taken to Longkeep Castle ([[Dumbarton Castle]]), the headquarters of the German espionage ring, where they are imprisoned by Professor Fisher ([[Patrick Malahide]]). They escape and return to where they were captured to look for the notebook, which Victoria reveals she had pick-pocketed from Hannay and hidden. They stay overnight in an inn, where Hannay details the contents of the notebook to Victoria.

[[Image:The 39 Steps (2008) - Hannay and Victoria.jpg|thumb|right|At the foot of the 39 steps, Hannay (Penry-Jones) and Victoria (Leonard) find Sir George and the Germans at their rendezvous point by the loch.]]
In the morning, they escape to Harry's house, where Victoria unsuccessfully attempts to contact Captain Kell. Hannay, alone, meets with Sir George, who sits on the defence committee. Hannay reveals the contents of the notebook, leading to Sir George disclosing that a meeting of the National Committee of Defence is being held the next day at [[Stirling Castle]] to unveil new naval plans, matching part of the double code. Later, Hannay and Victoria kiss, and the next morning he sees her leaving with a man, whom he recalls seeing previously on the train and at the rally. With the notebook missing and finding out that Victoria disconnected the call she made to the Secret Service Bureau before it was connected, Hannay goes to Stirling Castle, believing Victoria to be a traitor. There, Victoria reveals she works for the Secret Service Bureau and he meets Kell ([[Alex Jennings]]) and Wakeham, the man Victoria left with earlier ([[Steven Elder]]), who reveal they used Hannay to distract the Germans and sent Victoria to keep an eye on him. Hannay deduces that Sir George is the traitor and, with his [[photographic memory]], has escaped with the naval plans memorised. To identify his rendezvous point with the Germans, they crack the remaining code, referring to the room they were previously imprisoned in at Longkeep Castle, and discover "39 steps" written in the notebook by Scudder using [[invisible ink]]. At the Castle, Hannay and Victoria find 39 steps leading to a loch. A shoot-out ensues, and a German [[U-boat]] surfaces in the loch. Fisher, the Germans and Sir George fail to get to the U-boat before it submerges, and surrender.

Together by the loch, Hannay and Victoria kiss before she is hit by a bullet fired by a surviving gunman, falling into the loch and disappearing. The story concludes four months later, after the declaration of [[World War I]], when Hannay, in military uniform, is waiting to meet someone at [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras station]]. Harry appears, saying that Victoria wanted to say goodbye. Hannay sees her across the hall, before she disappears behind a luggage trolley and Harry says he'll see her after the war.

==Production==
Announced by the [[BBC]] in August 2008, filming began in September 2008 for airing at Christmas. Penry-Jones, who had previously worked on spy drama ''[[Spooks]]'', would take the lead role, with the screenplay written by [[Lizzie Mickery]] (co-writer of the dramas ''[[The State Within]]'' and ''[[Messiah (TV series)|Messiah]]''), produced by [[Lynn Horsford]] (''[[Boy A#Film adaptation|Boy A]]'', ''[[The Mark of Cain (2007 film)|The Mark of Cain]]'')  and directed by [[James Hawes]] (''[[Fanny Hill (2007 serial)|Fanny Hill]]'', ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]'').<ref name="BBC-announcement">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/08_august/21/39steps.shtml|title=''The 39 Steps''|date=21 August 2008|publisher=[[BBC]] Press Office|accessdate=2008-12-31}}</ref> Penry-Jones became the fifth actor to play Hannay on film, preceded by [[Robert Donat]], [[Kenneth More]], [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] and [[Robert Powell]].

At the time of the announcement, Horsford said: "With this adaptation we wanted to stay faithful to the spirit and period of the book, but asked the writer Lizzie to feel free to re-imagine it for a modern audience more familiar with [[James Bond]] and [[Jason Bourne (character)|Jason Bourne]]."<ref name="BBC-announcement" /> The production was set around the eve of [[World War I]] and retained other elements from the book, including having the 39 steps refer to steps to a departure point, but, according to ''[[The Times]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> thriller critic, has "a style that gives more than a nod to the grittier James Bond of [[Daniel Craig]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5325755.ece|title=Rupert Penry-Jones plays it Bond-style in the BBC remake of ''The 39 Steps''|last=Millar|first=Peter|date=20 December 2008|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|accessdate=2008-12-31}}</ref> A piece in ''[[The Observer]]'' stated that Mickery "is braced for complaints this Christmas from fans of previous screen portrayals" after basing her plot on the original book rather than the films.<ref name="observer">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/nov/30/hitchcock-bbc-39-steps|title= Hitchcock's inventions disappear in BBC's latest version of ''The 39 Steps''|last=Thorpe|first=Vanessa|date=30 November 2008|publisher=''[[The Observer]]''|accessdate=2008-12-31}}</ref> Differences from the book include the introduction of romance for Hannay, through suffragette and spy Victoria Sinclair, played by [[Lydia Leonard]], and, according to Serena Davies of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', "a plot with so many twists and turns you almost need a degree in espionage to follow it".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3851516/The-39-Steps-Rupert-Penry-Jones.html|title=''The 39 Steps'': Rupert Penry-Jones|last=Davies|first=Serena|date=19 December 2008|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|accessdate=2008-12-31}}</ref>

<blockquote>"Part of the appeal was the cars, I'm a bit of a buff ... And I said - jokingly, of course - that I wouldn't be in ''The 39 Steps'' unless the action included the famous chase scene in which Hannay is pursued by a biplane. I've always wanted to be chased by a plane like Cary Grant in the movie ''North by Northwest'' and I was just delighted when it happened in our version of ''Steps''."<ref name="Daily-Record">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/showbiz-news/celebrity-interviews/2008/12/27/former-spooks-star-rupert-penry-jones-returns-to-action-in-new-version-of-39-steps-86908-20997823/|title=Former ''Spooks'' star Rupert Penry-Jones returns to action in new version of ''39 Steps''|last=Oglethorpe|first=Tim|date=27 December 2008|publisher=''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]''|accessdate=2009-01-01}}</ref></blockquote>

He also said prior to broadcast that, depending on the reception, "They'd like to do more if they can. I definitely would."<ref name="DS" />

The production was shot using [[35 mm film|35&nbsp;mm film]] rather than [[High-definition television|high-definition]] cameras. Hawes told Matthew Bell of ''[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]'' that:

<blockquote>"Film is absolutely right for this project. It has scale, big exterior locations and that's something that still challenges HD. ... The HD cameras available to us on our budget are still vulnerable in difficult weather conditions [encountered during filming]. There's no doubt that what we've got on 35mm is just so much more detailed. It has so much more depth of field and richness than we could have got on HD."<ref name="broadcast" /></blockquote>

The adaptation was originally planned to be broadcast on [[BBC One]] on Boxing Day,<ref name="observer" /> but was later moved to a Sunday night slot on 28 December. It was simulcast in [[High-definition television|high-definition]] on [[BBC HD]].

===Artistic licence and historical inaccuracies===
Some [[artistic licence]] was used to find the appropriate [[Theatrical property|props]]. Cars used included a 1924 [[Morris Oxford]], a 1926 [[Darracq]], and a 1927 [[Wolseley Motor Company|Wolseley]], previously used in the 1960s series ''[[Dr. Finlay's Casebook (TV & radio)|Dr Finlay's Casebook]]''. Willie Bennie, who sourced the vehicles, told the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'':

<blockquote>"I knew they were wanting to include car chases to make the drama much more exciting to watch. The only trouble was that the cars around this era weren't very fast."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/car-reviews/car-guide/2008/12/26/classic-cars-get-top-billing-86908-20995733/|title=Scots Enthusiasts Called In to Provide Old Motors For New TV Adaptation of Spy Novel ''The 39 Steps''|last=Caven|first=Bill|date=26 December 2008|publisher=''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]''|accessdate=2009-01-01}}</ref></blockquote>

Ben Stephenson, Head of Drama Commissioning at the BBC, told ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in reply to complaints about the inaccuracies:
<blockquote>"The question is: for the seven million people who watched it, did it feel authentic, did it create a sense of period? ...We were creating a realistic world within a world <U+2014> a world of damsels and heroes and a huge amount of excitement. That, for me, is the priority. Did it create that world? It absolutely did. That's not to say that we don't work increasingly hard to get everything right. But it's hard to get all the details right when it's a 21st century drama, never mind anything earlier."<ref name="Telegraph-accuracy" /></blockquote>

Overnight viewing figures estimated that the programme was seen by 7.3&nbsp;million viewers (28% audience share) on 28 December 2008, against a ''[[Top Gear: Vietnam Special]]'' on [[BBC Two]]. It was the most watched programme of the day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/dec/29/top-gear-39-steps-ratings|title=TV ratings: ''Top Gear'' outpaced by ''The 39 Steps''|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=29 December 2008|publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]]|accessdate=2008-12-31}}</ref>

The adaptation received mostly negative reviews from the press, believing it didn't match up to Hitchcock's [[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|1935 film version]] (as predicted by Mickery). Sam Wollaston of ''[[The Guardian]]'' felt that the romance scene between Hannay and Victoria (when they stay overnight in an inn) was "one of the silliest ever" and felt that after the final scene at the loch and the concluding scene: "It's all very silly. ... It doesn't have the pace, the moodiness or the wit."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/dec/29/weekend-television-review|title=The weekend's TV|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|date=29 December 2008 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=2008-12-31}}</ref> Damien Love of ''[[Sunday Herald]]'' felt the "tepid pace" was set by the casting of Penry-Jones, and that he "... has a style reminiscent of the young Roger Moore, but without the vital, animating spark of self-deprecation. As Hannay, Penry-Jones is not at his best, and more reminiscent of a well-stuffed armchair on wheels."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sundayherald.com/arts/arts/display.var.2478011.0.tv_preview_when_the_only_intrigue_is_why_it_exists_you_know_this_is_a_39_steps_too_far.php|title=TV preview: When the only intrigue is why it exists, you know this is a 39 Steps too far |last=Love|first=Damien|date=28 December 2008|publisher=''[[Sunday Herald]]''|accessdate=2009-01-01}}</ref> Mick Hume of ''[[The Times]]'' said "The overall effect was to turn Buchan's blood and thunder tale into a pallid politically correct [[Enid Blyton]] story."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5393842.ece|title=''The 39 Steps''; ''Affinity''; ''Caught in a Trap''|last=Hume|first=Mick|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|accessdate=2008-12-31}}</ref> and ''[[The Independent]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Robert Hanks concluded his review by saying that "By the end, my impression was that several pages of the plot must have been eaten by a dog, or a bored actor, and the director had decided, sod it, nobody's going to keep watching this long.

However, the adaptation did receive some positive comments. In ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', [[A. A.
