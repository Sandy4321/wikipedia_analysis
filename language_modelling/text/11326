'''New York State Route 359''' (NY 359) is a [[state highway]] located entirely within the town of [[Skaneateles (town), New York|Skaneateles]] in [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]], [[New York]]. At {{convert|1.71|mi|km}} in length, it is one of the shortest signed state highways in all of New York. The route begins at [[New York State Route 38A|NY 38A]] a half-mile (0.8&nbsp;km) north of the Onondaga-[[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga County]] county line and ends at [[New York State Route 41A|NY 41A]] in the hamlet of Mandana. It lies between [[Skaneateles Lake]] and [[Owasco Lake]]. Excluding its termini, there are only two junctions with other roadways along the entire route.

==Route description==
[[Image:NY 359.jpg|left|thumb|NY 359 at southern terminus at NY 38A]]
NY 359 begins in the town of [[Skaneateles (town), New York|Skaneateles]] at an intersection with Heifer Street, a local road, and [[New York State Route 38A|NY 38A]]. The route goes north, intersecting with Weeks Road {{convert|0.6|mi|km}} north of NY 38A. Here, Route 359 begins to curve to the east with Weeks Road carrying on the northward alignment of NY 359. Upon meeting Lacy Road, the route takes over its east-west routing and heads east. Route 359 comes to an end just under a mile later at [[New York State Route 41A|NY 41A]] in the lakeside hamlet of Mandana. East of NY 41A, the roadway continues for roughly {{convert|400|ft|m}} to a boat launch on the western shore of [[Skaneateles Lake]], {{convert|1.71|mi|km}} from Niles and NY 38A.<ref name="google">{{cite map|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&rlz=1T4ADBF_enUS232US232&q=from:+Lacy+Rd/RT-359+%4042.865504,+-76.403607+to:+RT-359+%4042.854131,+-76.423042&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wl|title=Overview map of NY 359|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref>[[Image:NY 359 N.jpg|right|thumb|NY 359 at northern terminus at NY 41A]]

Signed as a north-south route, it lies that way at the southern end, but about midway along its length the road turns and thence travels east-west. Excluding its termini, there are only two junctions with other roadways along the entire route.<ref name="google"/> It is the only instance in New York of a route designated without an alphabetic suffix that terminates at both ends at suffixed routes.<ref name="dot">{{cite journal|title=Official Description of Highway Touring Routes, Scenic Byways, & Bicycle Routes in New York State|author=[[New York State Department of Transportation]]|date=October 2007|accessdate=2008-05-10}}</ref>

== History ==
NY 359 was originally designated as part of [[New York State Route 26 (1924)|New York State Route 26]] when [[state highway]]s in [[New York]] were first signed in 1924. North of Mandana, NY 26 followed what is now [[New York State Route 41A|NY 41A]] toward the village of [[Skaneateles (village), New York|Skaneateles]]. To the south, NY 26 continued toward [[Moravia (village), New York|Moravia]] on modern [[New York State Route 38A|NY 38A]].<ref>{{cite news|title=New York's Main Highways Designated by Numbers|work=[[New York Times]]|date=[[1924-12-21]]|page=XX9}}</ref> In the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]], the routing of NY 26 was incorporated into several new routes, including part of NY 38A from Moravia to the modern junction of NY 38A and NY 359, and part of NY 41A from Mandana to Skaneateles. The portion that is now NY 359, however, received no designation and became unnumbered.<ref>''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book'', 1930/31 and 1931/32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930/31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]]</ref> It was eventually designated NY 359 between 1938 and 1947. Prior to 1938, the NY 359 designation was assigned to what is now County Route 108<!--assuming this is it--> between [[U.S. Route 104]] (now [[New York State Route 104|NY 104]]) and [[New York State Route 31|NY 31]] in [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]].<ref name=1947map>{{cite map |title=Official Highway Map of New York State |publisher=[[State of New York Department of Public Works]] |edition=1947-48 |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref><ref>''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book'', 1938/39 edition, (W.A.
