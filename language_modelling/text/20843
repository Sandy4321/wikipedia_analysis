The '''Massachusetts Institute of Technology''' ('''MIT''') is a private research university located in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]]. MIT has five schools and one college, containing a total of 32 academic departments, with a strong emphasis on scientific and technological research. MIT is one of two private [[land-grant university|land-grant universities]]{{Ref_label|b|b|none}} and is also a [[sea grant colleges|sea-grant]] and [[space grant colleges|space-grant]] university.

Founded by [[William Barton Rogers]] in 1861 in response to the increasing [[Technological and industrial history of the United States|industrialization of the United States]], the university adopted the [[History of European research universities|European polytechnic university model]] and emphasized laboratory instruction from an early date.<ref>{{cite book|last=Angulo |first=A.J. |title=William Barton Rogers and the Idea of MIT |pages=155<U+2013>156 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0801890330}}</ref> Its current {{convert|168|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} campus opened in 1916 and extends over {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} along the northern bank of the [[Charles River|Charles River basin]].<ref name="Campus">{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/facts/campus.html |title=MIT Facts: The Campus |publisher=MIT |accessdate=8 September 2010 |year=2010}}</ref> MIT was elected to the [[Association of American Universities]] in 1934 and researchers were involved in efforts to develop [[whirlwind (computer)|computers]], [[radar]], and [[inertial navigation system|inertial guidance]] in connection with [[Technology in World War II|defense research]] during [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]]. In the past 60 years, MIT's educational disciplines have expanded beyond the [[physical science]]s and [[engineering]] into fields like [[biology]], [[economics]], [[linguistics]], [[political science]], and [[management]].

As early as 1859, the [[Massachusetts General Court]] was given a proposal for use of newly opened lands in [[Back Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|Back Bay]] in [[Boston]] for a museum and Conservatory of Art and Science.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kneeland |first=Samuel |url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/pdf/house260.pdf |format=PDF|title=Committee Report:Conservatory of Art and Science |publisher=Massachusetts House of Representatives, House No. 260 |month=March | year=1859}}</ref> In 1861, The Commonwealth of Massachusetts approved a charter for the incorporation of the "Massachusetts Institute of Technology and [[Boston Society of Natural History]]" submitted by [[William Barton Rogers]]. Rogers sought to establish a new form of higher education to address the challenges posed by rapid advances in science and technology during the mid-19th century with which [[liberal arts college|classic institutions]] were ill-prepared to deal.<ref>{{cite web |title=MIT Facts 2008: Mission and Origins |url=http://web.mit.edu/facts/mission.shtml |accessdate=2008-08-14 |publisher=MIT}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers |first=William |publisher=The Committee of Associated Institutions of Science and Arts |url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/pdf/objects-plan.pdf |format=PDF|title=Objects and Plan of an Institute of Technology: including a Society of Arts, a Museum of Arts, and a School of Industrial Science; proposed to be established in Boston |year=1861}}</ref> Barton believed, <U+201C>The true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is, as I conceive, the teaching, not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts, which can be done only in the workshop, but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them, their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/timeline/letter1846.html |title=Letter from William Barton Rogers to His Brother Henry |date=March 13, 1846 |accessdate=October 2, 2010 |publisher=Institute Archives, MIT}}</ref>

Because open conflict in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] broke out only weeks after receiving the charter, MIT's first classes were held in rented space at the Mercantile Building in downtown [[Boston]] in 1865.<ref>{{cite web |last=Andrews |first=Elizabeth |coauthors=Nora Murphy and Tom Rosko |year=2000 |url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/wbr-visionary/ |publisher=MIT Archives |title=William Barton Rogers: MIT's Visionary Founder}}</ref> Though it was to be located in the middle of Boston, the mission of the new institute matched the intent of the 1862 [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]] to fund institutions "to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes." Although the Commonwealth of Massachusetts founded what was to become the [[University of Massachusetts]] under this act,{{Ref_label|d|d|none}} MIT was also named a land grant school.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stratton |first1=Julius Adams |last2=Mannix |first2=Loretta H. |title=Mind and Hand: The Birth of MIT |pages=251<U+2013>276 |chapter=The Land-Grant Act of 1862 |isbn=0262195240 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2005}}</ref> The proceeds went toward new buildings in Boston's Back Bay in 1866; MIT was called "Boston Tech."<ref>{{cite book|title=When M.I.T.

Over the next 40 years, the MIT faculty and alumni repeatedly rejected overtures from [[Harvard University]] president [[Charles W. Eliot]] to merge MIT with Harvard's [[Lawrence Scientific School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/harvard-mit/index.html |title=Alumni Petition Opposing MIT-Harvard Merger, 1904-05 |publisher=Institute Archives, MIT |accessdate=October 1, 2010}}</ref>

Bosworth]].

In the 1930s President [[Karl Taylor Compton]] and Vice-President (effectively [[Provost (education)|Provost]]) [[Vannevar Bush]] drastically reformed the curriculum by re-emphasizing the importance of "pure" sciences like physics and chemistry and reducing the work required in shops and drafting. Despite the challenges of the [[Great Depression]], the reforms "renewed confidence in the ability of the Institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering."<ref name="Lewis Report"/> The expansion and reforms cemented MIT's academic reputation and it was elected to the [[Association of American Universities]] in 1934.<ref name="AAU">{{cite web|url=http://www.aau.edu/aau/members.html |title=Member Institutions and Years of Admission |publisher=Association of American Universities |accessdate=14 August 2008}}</ref>

MIT was substantially changed by its involvement in military research during World War II. Bush was appointed head of the enormous [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] and directed funding to only a select group of universities, including MIT.<ref>{{cite book |last=Leslie |first=Stuart |title = The Cold War and American Science: The Military-Industrial-Academic Complex at MIT and Stanford |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-231-07959-1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Zachary|first=Gregg |title=Endless Frontier: Vannevar Bush, Engineer of the American Century |publisher= Free Press |year=1997 |isbn = 0-684-82821-9 }}</ref> MIT's [[Radiation Laboratory]] was established in 1940 to assist the [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|British]] in developing a [[cavity magnetron|microwave]] [[radar]] and the first mass-produced units were installed on front-line units within months. Other defense projects included [[gyroscope]]-based and other complex [[control system]]s for [[gun sight|gun]] and [[bombsight]]s and [[inertial navigation]] under [[Charles Stark Draper]]'s [[Charles Stark Draper Laboratory|Instrumentation Laboratory]], the development of a [[digital computer]] for flight simulations under [[Project Whirlwind]], and [[high-speed photography|high-speed]] and [[Espionage balloon|high-altitude]] photography under [[Harold Edgerton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edgerton-digital-collections.org/docs-life/wartime-strobe |accessdate=28 November 2009 |title=Wartime Strobe: 1939<U+2013>1945 <U+00AB> Harold "Doc" Edgerton |h2=Doc's Life}}</ref> By the end of the war, MIT employed a staff of over 4,000 (including more than a fifth of the nation's physicists) and was the nation's single largest wartime R&D contractor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/MIT_Rad_Lab |title=MIT's Rad Lab |publisher= IEEE Global History Network |accessdate=25 July 2008}}</ref>

In the post-war years, [[Research funding|government-sponsored research]] such as [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] and guidance systems for [[ballistic missile]]s and [[Project Apollo]] combined with surging student enrollments under the [[G.I. Bill]] contributed to a rapid growth in the size of the Institute's research staff and physical plant as well as placing an increased emphasis on graduate education.<ref name="Lewis Report"/> The profound changes that occurred at MIT between 1930 and 1957 included the doubling of its faculty and a quintupling of its graduate student population. These changes were significantly guided and shaped by the institution-building strategies of [[Karl Taylor Compton]], president of MIT between 1930 and 1948, [[James Rhyne Killian]], president from 1948 to 1957, and [[Julius Adams Stratton]], chancellor from 1952 to 1957.<ref>Lecuyer, 1992</ref>

While the school mainly served the needs of industrial patrons in the 1920s, by the 1950s it had gained considerable autonomy from industrial corporations while attracting new patrons and building a close relationship with philanthropic foundations and the federal government. As the [[Cold War]] and [[Space Race]] intensified and concerns about the [[Sputnik crisis|technology gap]] between the U.S. and the Soviet Union grew more pervasive throughout the 1950s and 1960s, MIT's involvement in the [[military-industrial complex]] was a source of pride on campus.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tech.mit.edu/archives/VOL_078/TECH_V078_S0008_P001.pdf |format=PDF|title=More Emphasis on Science Vitally Needed to Educate Man for A Confused Civilization |date=February 14, 1958 |publisher=The Tech |accessdate=5 November 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://tech.mit.edu/archives/VOL_078/TECH_V078_S0030_P001.pdf |format=PDF|title=Iron Birds Caged in Building 7 Lobby: Missiles on Display Here |publisher=The Tech |date=February 25, 1958|accessdate5 November 2006}}</ref>

Following a comprehensive review of the undergraduate curriculum in 1949 and the successive appointments of more [[Humanities|humanistically oriented]] Presidents [[Howard W.

The School of Engineering has been ranked first among graduate and undergraduate programs by ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' since first published results in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/eng/search |title=USNWR's Best Graduate Programs in Engineering |accessdate=December 31, 2008 |year=2010 |work=[[U.S. News & World Report]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=MIT undergraduate engineering again ranked No. 1 |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/undergraduate-rankings.html |date=August 17, 2010 |publisher=MIT News Office}}</ref> A 1995 [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] study of US research universities ranked MIT first in "reputation" and fourth in "citations and faculty awards" and a 2005 [[National Bureau of Economic Research|NBER]] study of high school students' [[revealed preference]]s found MIT to be the 4th most preferred college in the nation.<ref name="1995 NRC">{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.tamu.edu/~jnewton/nrc_rankings/nrc1.html |title=NRC Rankings |accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Avery |first1=Christopher |last2=Glickman |first2=Mark E. |last3=Hoxby |first3=Caroline M |last4=Metrick |first4=Andrew |title=A Revealed Preference Ranking of U.S. Colleges and Universities, NBER Working Paper No. W10803 |month=December | year=2005 |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=601105}}</ref>

===Undergraduate program===
The four year, full-time undergraduate instructional program is classified as "balanced arts & sciences/professions" and admission is characterized as "more selective, lower transfer in."<ref name="Carnegie"/> MIT offers 44 undergraduate degrees across its five schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/catalog/front.degre.html |title=MIT Course Catalog: Degree Charts |publisher=Officer of the Registrar, Massachusetts Institute of Technology |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref> 1,146 [[bachelor of science]] (SB) degrees were granted in 2009, the only type of undergraduate degree MIT awards.<ref name="Degrees">{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/ir/pop/students/degrees.html |title=5 years of MIT Degrees Awarded |publisher=Institutional Research, Office of the Provost, MIT |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/catalog/overv.chap3.html |title=MIT Course Catalog: Academic Programs |publisher=Officer of the Registrar, Massachusetts Institute of Technology |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref> The School of Engineering is the most popular division enrolling 44.5% of students in its 19 degree programs, followed by the School of Science (20.2%), School of Humanities, Arts, & Social Sciences (3.5%), Sloan School of Management (3.5%), and the School of Architecture and Planning (1.8%).<ref name="Enrollments by School">{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/ir/pop/students/enrollment_by_school.html |title=Enrollment by School |publisher=Institutional Research, Office of the Provost, MIT |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref> The largest undergraduate degree programs are in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (Course VI-2), Mechanical Engineering (Course II), Computer Science and Engineering (Course VI-3), Physics (Course VIII), Biology (Course VII), and Mathematics (Course XVIII).<ref name="Enrollments"/>

Undergraduates are required to complete an extensive core curriculum called the General Institute Requirements (GIRs).<ref name="GIR">{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/catalog/overv.chap3-gir.html |title=MIT Course Catalog: Undergraduate General Institute Requirements |publisher=Officer of the Registrar, Massachusetts Institute of Technology |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref> The science requirement, generally completed during freshman year as prerequisites for classes in science and engineering majors, comprises two semesters of physics, two semesters of calculus, one semester of chemistry, one semester of biology, and a laboratory class in their major. The humanities, arts, and social sciences (HASS) requirement, consisting of eight semesters, includes a distribution of three classes across each of the humanities, arts, and social sciences as well as a concentration. The communication requirement consists of two communication-intensive HASS classes and two classes in their major program. Finally, all students are required to complete a swimming test and non-varsity athletes must also take four [[physical education]] classes.<ref name="GIR"/>

In the first (fall) term, freshmen transcripts only report if a class was passed while no external record exists if a class was not passed. In the second (spring) term, passing grades (ABC) appear on the transcript while non-passing grades are again rendered "no-record".<ref name="Freshman Year">{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/catalog/overv.chap3.html#fre |title=MIT Course Catalog: Freshman Year |publisher=Officer of the Registrar, Massachusetts Institute of Technology |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref> The system had previously been "Pass/No Record" all freshman year, but was amended for the Class of 2006 to prevent students from gaming the system by completing required major classes on a pass/fail basis.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wang |first=W.S. |last=Keuss |first=Nancy |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V120/N50/p-nr_-_real.50f.html |title=The Evolution of MIT<U+2019>s Pass/No Record System |newspaper=The Tech |volume=120 |issue=50 |date=October 17, 2000 |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref>

Most classes rely upon a combination of faculty led lectures, graduate student led recitations, weekly problem sets (p-sets), and tests to teach material, though alternative curricula exist, e.g. [[Experimental Study Group]], Concourse, and Terrascope.<ref name="Freshman Year"/> Over time, students compile "bibles", collections of problem set and examination questions and answers used as references for later students. In 1970, the then-Dean of Institute Relations, Benson R. Snyder, published ''[[The Hidden Curriculum]],'' arguing that unwritten regulations, like the implicit curricula of the bibles, are often counterproductive; they fool professors into believing that their teaching is effective and students into believing they have learned the material.

In 1969, MIT began the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) to enable undergraduates to collaborate directly with faculty members and researchers. The program, founded by [[Margaret MacVicar]], builds upon the MIT philosophy of "learning by doing". Students obtain research projects, colloquially called "UROPs", through postings on the UROP website or by contacting faculty members directly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/UROP/ |title=UROP homepage |accessdate=2007-08-05}}</ref> Over 2,800 undergraduates, 70% of the student body, participate every year for academic credit, pay, or on a volunteer basis.<ref>{{cite web|title=MIT Research and Teaching Firsts |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/special/firsts.html |accessdate=2006-10-06 |publisher=MIT News Office |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060915023328/http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/special/firsts.html |archivedate = September 15, 2006}}</ref> Students often become [[scientific journal|published]], file [[patent application]]s, and/or launch [[startup company|start-up companies]] based upon their experience in UROPs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Use of Undergraduates in Research Is Hailed by M.I.T.; Inventions by Students |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |last=Maeroff |first=Gene I. |date=January 11, 1976}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V119/N47/UROP_turns_30.47f.html |title=An MIT Original, the Oft Replicated UROP Program Reaches 30 Years |last=Palmer |first=Matthew |date=October 5, 1999 |newspaper=The Tech}}</ref>

==Notes==
<div class=references-small>

:a. {{note_label|a|a|none}} "We examined and discussed many colors. We all desired cardinal red; it has stood for a thousand years on land and sea in England's emblem; it makes one-half of the stripes on America's flag; it has always stirred the heart and mind of man; it stands for 'red blood' and all that 'red blood' stands for in life. But we were not unanimous for the gray; some wanted blue, I recall. But it (the gray) seemed to me to stand for those quiet virtues of modesty and persistency and gentleness, which appealed to my mind as powerful; and I have come to believe, from observation and experience, to really be the most lasting influences in life and history....We recommended 'cardinal and steel gray.'"
