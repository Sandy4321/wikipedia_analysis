'''''Microgale macpheei''''' is an extinct [[shrew tenrec]] from southeastern [[Madagascar]]. It is known only from two partial skulls found in [[Andrahomana]] cave, which [[radiocarbon dating]] on associated rodent remains suggests are about 2000 years old. It is the only known recently extinct [[tenrec]]. First described in 2007, it is most similar to the smaller ''[[Microgale brevicaudata]]'' of northern and western Madagascar. ''M.&nbsp;macpheei'' has a broad rostrum (front part of the skull) and, like ''M.&nbsp;brevicaudata'', lacks a [[diastema (dentistry)|diastema]] (gap) between the [[premolar]]s. A number of details of tooth morphology are characteristic of ''M.&nbsp;macpheei''.
==Taxonomy==
Remains of [[shrew tenrec]]s (''Microgale'') were found during 2000 and 2003 expeditions to the cave of [[Andrahomana]] in southeastern Madagascar led by David Burney.<ref name=Gea368>Goodman et al., 2007, p.&nbsp;368</ref> The ''Microgale'' material was described as a new species, ''M.&nbsp;macpheei'', in 2007 by [[Steven Goodman]], Natalie Vasey, and Burney.<ref name=Gea370>Goodman et al., 2007, p.&nbsp;370</ref> The species was named after Ross MacPhee in honor of his contributions to knowledge of ''Microgale'' and the paleontology of Madagascar.<ref name=Gea371>Goodman et al., 2007, p.&nbsp;371</ref> Goodman and colleagues considered that the living ''[[Microgale brevicaudata]]'' from northern and western Madagascar was the closest relative of ''M.&nbsp;macpheei'';<ref name=Gea373>Goodman et al., 2007, p.&nbsp;373</ref> some populations of this tenrec have since been separated into a different species, ''[[Microgale grandidieri|M.&nbsp;grandidieri]]''.<ref name=Oea1095>Olson et al., 2009, p.&nbsp;1095</ref> The [[common name]] "MacPhee's shrew tenrec" has been proposed for ''M.&nbsp;macpheei''.<ref>Muldoon et al., 2009, p.&nbsp;1117</ref> The genus of ''M.&nbsp;macpheei'', ''Microgale'', includes more than 20&nbsp;species and is the largest of the [[tenrec]] family, which includes a variety of other Madagascan mammals.<ref name=Oea1095/>
==Description==
''Microgale macpheei'' is known from two specimens: a damaged [[cranium]] (skull without [[mandible]]s, or lower jaws) lacking the back part (the [[parietal bone]]s and further back) as well as the [[incisor]]s, [[canine (tooth)|canines]], and second [[premolar]]s;{{#tag:ref|The dental formula in ''Microgale'' is {{DentalFormula|upper=3.1.3.3|lower=3.1.3.3}} (three incisors, one canine, three premolars, and three molars in both the upper and lower dentition). The three premolars are numbered 2, 3, and 4, as the first premolar is presumed to have been lost.<ref>MacPhee, 1987, p.&nbsp;11</ref>|group=Note}}<ref name=Gea370/> and another damaged cranium lacking the same parts as well as the left toothrow.<ref name=Gea371/> Both show no evidence of ongoing [[tooth replacement]], indicating that the [[permanent dentition]] is complete.<ref name=Gea370-1>Goodman et al., 2007, pp.&nbsp;370<U+2013>371</ref> ''M.&nbsp;macpheei'' was larger in most measurements than ''M.&nbsp;brevicaudata'',{{#tag:ref|This description is based on Goodman et al. (2007), published before ''M.&nbsp;grandidieri'' and ''M.&nbsp;brevicaudata'' were described as distinct species. Much of the material of "''M.&nbsp;brevicaudata''" used in the 2007 paper is in fact ''M.&nbsp;grandidieri''.<ref>Olson et al., 2009, p.&nbsp;1107</ref>|group=Note}} but because of small samples, some differences are not [[statistically significant]].<ref name=Gea373/> The length of the bony [[palate]] in the two specimens of ''M.&nbsp;macpheei'' is 9.4 and 9.7&nbsp;mm, compared to 7.1 to 9.0&nbsp;mm in eight adult ''M.&nbsp;brevicaudata''. In both specimens, the length of the molar row is 3.0&nbsp;mm, compared to 2.4 to 2.8&nbsp;mm in the sample of ''M.&nbsp;brevicaudata''.<ref>Goodman et al., 2007, table&nbsp;1</ref>

The rostrum (front part of the skull) is short and blunt in both ''M.&nbsp;macpheei'' and ''M.&nbsp;brevicaudata'', contrasting with the condition in other ''Microgale'',<ref name=Gea370/> but the rostrum of ''M.&nbsp;brevicaudata'' is distinctly more tapered at the front, whereas that of ''M.&nbsp;macpheei'' is more blunt at the front.<ref name=Gea371/> Unlike other ''Microgale'', ''M.&nbsp;brevicaudata'' and ''M.&nbsp;macpheei'' lack gaps ([[diastema (dentistry|diastemata]]) between the premolars.<ref name=Gea370-1/> ''M.&nbsp;macpheei'' had larger, more robust teeth than ''M.&nbsp;brevicaudata''.<ref name=Gea371/> In both species, the [[mesiostyle]] and [[distostyle]], two crests, on the fourth premolar (P4) and the [[molar (tooth)|molars]] are reduced relative to the condition in other ''Microgale''.<ref name=Gea370/> ''M.&nbsp;macpheei'' lacks an extension of the [[protocone]] cusp on the lingual (inner) side of the third upper premolar (P3) and P4, present in ''M.&nbsp;brevicaudata'', and has the [[paracone]] cusp on P4 less well-developed. On the other hand, the front part of the [[ectostyle]] crest on P4 is larger. The relative lengths of some of the crests on the two last molars{{#tag:ref|Goodman et al. (2007) are inconsistent in identifying the three molars as M1 through M3<ref name=Gea373/> or M2 through M4;<ref>Goodman et al., 2007, pp.&nbsp;369<U+2013>370</ref> the former convention is used in MacPhee's 1987 revision of the genus.<ref>E.g., MacPhee, 1987, fig.&nbsp;8</ref>|group=Note}} also differ between the two species.<ref name=Gea371/>
==Distribution and ecology==
''Microgale macpheei'' is known only from the cave of Andrahomana.<ref name=Gea371/> Its past presence there, like that of the extinct rodent ''[[Hypogeomys australis]]'', suggests formerly more [[mesic habitat|mesic]] (wet) conditions around the cave, which is currently in a dry area.<ref name=Gea374/> In addition to ''M.&nbsp;macpheei'', three other tenrecs have been described from [[subfossil]] material, but none are currently recognized as valid species;<ref name=Gea373/> thus, ''M.&nbsp;macpheei'' is at present the only known recently extinct tenrec species.<ref name=Gea374/> However, there is a remnant patch of mesic forest near Andrahomana, where a population of ''M.&nbsp;macpheei'' may survive. Although no [[radiocarbon dating]] has been carried out on ''M.&nbsp;macpheei'' remains, bones of the rodent ''[[Macrotarsomys petteri]]'' from layers in the same cave deposit bracketing those where ''M.&nbsp;macpheei'' was found yield dates of around 2480 and 1760 [[Before Present]].<ref name=Gea374>Goodman et al., 2007, p.&nbsp;374</ref>
