She received her degree from Stanford University in 1985 and was assigned as an assistant professor of aeronautics at the U.S. Air Force Academy. In 1987, she attended the Air Force Test Pilot School at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]]. After completing one year of training as a [[flight test engineer]], Helms was assigned as a USAF Exchange Officer to the Aerospace Engineering Test Establishment, at [[CFB Cold Lake|Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake]] in [[Alberta, Canada]], where she worked as a flight test engineer and project officer on the [[CF-18]] aircraft. She was managing the development of a CF-18 Flight Control System Simulation for the Canadian Forces when selected for the astronaut program.

After a 12-year NASA career that included 211 days in space, Helms returned to the [[U.S. Air Force]] in July 2002 to take a position at HQ USAF [[Space Command]]. After a stint as the Division Chief of the Space Control Division of the Requirements Directorate of Air Force Space Command in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], she served as Vice Commander of the 45th Space Wing at [[Patrick Air Force Base]] near [[Cape Canaveral, Florida]]. She then served as Deputy Director of Operations for Air Education and Training Command at [[Randolph Air Force Base]] near [[San Antonio, Texas]]. She was promoted to [[Brigadier General]] in June 2006 and assumed the duties of Commander of the [[45th Space Wing]] on the same day of her promotion.<ref name=AFBio>[http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=8588 USAF Biography of Helms]</ref>

She is directly responsible to the U.S. Strategic Command Commander for the development and implementation of national security policy and guidance; military strategy and guidance; space and weapons employment concepts and policy; and joint doctrine as they apply to the command and the execution of its missions. She is also responsible for the development of the nation's strategic war plan, strategic support plans for theater combatant commanders and contingency planning for the global strike mission.

She has been confirmed for appointment to [[Lieutenant General]], with assignment as Commander, 14th Air Force and Commander, Joint Functional Component Command for Space, US Strategic Command<ref name=AFBio/><ref>http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2010/09/air-force-susan-helms-in-line-for-third-star-091610w/</ref><ref>http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/one_item_and_teasers/nom_cmten.htm</ref><ref>http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=13916</ref>

As a flight test engineer, Helms has flown in 30 different types of U.S. and Canadian military aircraft.

==Spaceflight experience==
[[Image:Susan Helms.jpg|thumb|right|NASA portrait of Helms]]
Selected by NASA in January 1990, Helms became an astronaut in July 1991. She flew on [[STS-54]] (1993), [[STS-64]] (1994), [[STS-78]] (1996), [[STS-101]] (2000) and served aboard the [[International Space Station]] as a member of the ''ISS [[Expedition 2]]'' crew (2001). A veteran of five space flights, Helms logged 5,064 hours in space, including an [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] of 8 hours and 56 minutes (world record).<ref>[http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/helms.html Official NASA biography of Susan Helms]</ref><ref>[http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/astronauts/english/helms_susan.htm Spacefacts biography of Susan J. Helms]</ref><ref>[http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/2006/nr20060317-12669.html DoD News General Officer Assignments]</ref>

[[STS-54]] ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', January 13<U+2013>19, 1993. The primary objective of this mission was the deployment of a $200-million NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-F). A Diffuse X-Ray Spectrometer (DXS) carried in the payload bay, collected over 80,000 seconds of quality X-ray data that will enable investigators to answer questions about the origin of the Milky Way galaxy. The crew demonstrated the physics principles of everyday toys to an interactive audience of elementary school students across the [[United States]]. A highly successful [[extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA) resulted in many lessons learned that will benefit International Space Station assembly. Mission duration was 5 days, 23 hours, 38 minutes, 17 seconds.

[[STS-64]] ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', September 9<U+2013>20, 1994. On this flight, Helms served as the flight engineer for orbiter operations and the primary RMS operator aboard [[Space Shuttle]]. The major objective of this flight was to validate the design and operating characteristics of Lidar in Space Technology Experiment (LITE) by gathering data about the Earth's troposphere and stratosphere. Additional objectives included the deploy and retrieval of [[SPARTAN-201]], a free-flying satellite that investigated the physics of the [[solar corona]], and the testing of a new EVA maneuvering device. The Shuttle Plume Impingement Flight Experiment (SPIFEX) was used to collect extensive data on the effects of jet thruster impingement, in preparation for proximity tasks such as space station docking. Mission duration was 10 days, 22 hours, 51 minutes.

[[STS-78]] ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', June 20 to July 7, 1996, Helms was the payload commander and flight engineer aboard ''Columbia'', on the longest Space Shuttle mission to date (later that year the STS-80 mission broke its record by nineteen hours.) The mission included studies sponsored by ten nations and five space agencies, and was the first mission to combine both a full microgravity studies agenda and a comprehensive life science investigation. The Life and Microgravity Spacelab mission served as a model for future studies on board the International Space Station. Mission duration was 16 days, 21 hours, 48 minutes.

[[STS-101]] ''[[Atlantis]]'', May 19<U+2013>29, 2000, was a mission dedicated to the delivery and repair of critical hardware for the International Space Station. Helms prime responsibilities during this mission were to perform critical repairs to extend the life of the Functional Cargo Block (FGB). In addition, she had prime responsibility of the onboard computer network and served as the mission specialist for rendezvous with the ISS. Mission duration was 9 days, 20 hours and 9 minutes.

[[Expedition 2]] March 8 to August 22, 2001 was a mission to the International Space Station and Helms was as a member of the second crew to inhabit the International Space Station Alpha. The ''Expedition 2'' crew (two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut) launched on March 8, 2001 on board [[STS-102]] ''Discovery'' and successfully docked with the station on March 9, 2001. The ''Expedition 2'' crew installed and conducted tests on the Canadian made Space Station Robotic arm (SSRMS), conducted internal and external maintenance tasks (Russian and American), in addition to medical and science experiments. During her stay on board the Space Station, Helms installed the Airlock (brought up on the [[STS-104]] mission) using the SSRM. She and her crewmates also performed a 'fly around' of the Russian ''[[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]]'' spacecraft and welcomed the visiting Soyuz crew that included the first [[Space tourism|space tourist]], [[Dennis Tito]]. On March 11 she performed a world record 8 hour and 56 minute space walk to install hardware to the external body of the laboratory module. Helms spent a total of 163 days aboard the Space Station. She returned to earth with the [[STS-105]] crew aboard ''Discovery'' on August 22, 2001.
