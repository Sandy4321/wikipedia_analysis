'''Fred Toyosaburo Korematsu''' (<U+662F><U+677E> <U+8C4A><U+4E09><U+90CE>, [[January 30]], [[1919]] &ndash; [[March 30]], [[2005]]) was one of the many Japanese-American citizens living on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] during [[World War II]]. Shortly after the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] attacked [[Pearl Harbor]], [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] issued [[Executive Order 9066]], authorizing the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] to require all Japanese-Americans in "Military Area No. 1" (the West Coast "exclusion zone") to report to the [[Japanese American internment|Internment Camps]].

Fred Korematsu was born in [[1919]] to Japanese parents living in [[Oakland, California]]. He worked in his family nursery growing up. When General [[John L. DeWitt]], commander of the Western Defense Area, ordered Japanese-American citizens to report to Assembly Centers as prelude to being removed to the camps, Mr. Korematsu refused and went into hiding. He changed his name and claimed to be of [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Hawaii]]an heritage. He was captured on [[May 30]], [[1942]], and was tried and convicted in federal court. He appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals. They upheld the original verdict. He appealed again and brought his case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. On [[December 18]], [[1944]], in a 6-3 decision, authored by [[Hugo Black|Justice Black]], the Court held that compulsory exclusion, though constitutionally suspect, is justified during circumstances of "emergency and peril". (See ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'' for more information.)

However, the Court also decided ''[[Ex parte Endo]]'' in December of 1944, granting [[Mitsuye Endo]] her liberty from the camps because the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and [[War Relocation Authority]] conceded that Endo was a "loyal and law-abiding citizen" and that no authority existed for detaining loyal citizens longer than necessary to separate the loyal from the disloyal. Endo's case did not address the question of whether the initial detention itself was constitutional, as did Korematsu's case.

In [[1980]], President [[Jimmy Carter]] appointed a special commission to investigate the  internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. The commission concluded that the decisions to remove those of Japanese ancestry to prison camps occurred because of "race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership." In [[1988]], Congress apologized and granted personal compensation of $20,000 to each surviving prisoner.

In the early [[1980s]], while researching a book on internment cases, lawyer [[Peter Irons]] came across evidence that when [[Charles Fahy]], the [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General of the United States]], argued ''Korematsu v. United States'' before the Supreme Court, he had deliberately suppressed reports from the [[FBI]] and military intelligence which concluded that Japanese-American citizens posed no security risk. Along with a team of lawyers headed by [[Dale Minami]], Irons filed a writ of ''[[coram nobis]]'' with the federal courts, seeking to overturn Korematsu's conviction. On [[November 10]], [[1983]], Judge [[Marilyn Hall Patel]] of [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court in San Francisco]] formally vacated the conviction.  

Under the [[ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] (promulgated in [[1983]] as a result of the [[Watergate scandal]]), a prosecutor's deliberate suppression of exonerating evidence is grounds for disbarment.  Fahy's actions are often mentioned in legal ethics textbooks as an example of why the modern rule is necessary.

In [[1998]], President Clinton awarded Korematsu with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

Fred Korematsu died of respiratory failure at his daughter's home in [[Marin County, California]] on [[March 30]], [[2005]].
