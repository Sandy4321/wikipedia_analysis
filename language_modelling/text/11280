''The Archives of Anthropos'' is written in the style of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', by [[C.S. Lewis]]. They are children<U+2019>s allegorical fantasies, in other words, and follow the same basic format of the ''Narnia'' books: children from Earth are magically transported to another world (in this case, Anthropos), where they are called by a Christ-figure to play key roles in that other world<U+2019>s history. Although a number of books similar to ''Narnia'' were released in the late 70s and early 80s, unlike most others, many find the ''Anthropos'' books to be of comparable quality to the ''Narnia'' series and even to surpass it in some ways.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

John White, the author, admitted having crafted the series after Lewis' own children's ''[[allegory]]''. He writes in the appendix of his fifth book, ''Quest for the King'': 

<blockquote> "My own children ganged up on me and came with the request that since I wrote books for adults, I could write them for children too. (Of course their assumption was incorrect!) "We won't bug you any more," they said, "if only you'll write a book for us. But it has to be just like Narnia!" So, intrigued, I decided I'd have a crack at it ... I wrote, and then read them my opening chapter of what eventually turned into The Tower of Geburah."</blockquote>

Responding to the criticism that he was merely copying Lewis' work, he writes "People said (quite accurately), 'He's just trying to copy Lewis.' I was. This was what my children wanted. That is, I was trying to copy Lewis at first, but I soon ceased to. Copying gets you nowhere. You have to make any genre your own for it to work."
