{{Other uses|Grand Slam (disambiguation){{!}}Grand Slam}}
In [[rugby union]], a '''Grand Slam''' (Irish: ''Caithr<U+00E9>im Mh<U+00F3>r''. Welsh: ''Y Gamp Lawn''. French: ''Le Grand Chelem'') occurs when one team in the [[Six Nations Championship]] (or its [[Six_Nations_Championship#Five_Nations_1910.E2.80.931931|Five Nations]] predecessor) manages to beat all the others during one year's competition.  This has been achieved 37 times in total, for the first time by [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] in [[1908 Home Nations Championship|1908]], and most recently again by Wales in [[2012 Six Nations Championship|2012]]. The team to have won the most Grand Slams is [[England national rugby union team|England]] with 12.

In another context, a '''Grand Slam tour''' refers to a [[Rugby union tour|touring]] side <U+2013> [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]], [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] or [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] <U+2013> which plays fixtures against all four home nations ([[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]]) during their tour. If the tourists then win all of those matches, they are said to have achieved a Grand Slam. This has been done nine times, first by South Africa in [[1912<U+2013>13 South Africa rugby union tour|1912<U+2013>13]], and most recently by New Zealand in [[2010 end of year rugby tests|2010]].

==Five and Six Nations Championship==
In the annual [[Six Nations Championship]] (between [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]], [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]], [[France national rugby union team|France]] and [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]]), and its predecessor the Five Nations Championship (before Italy joined in 2000), a Grand Slam occurs when one team beats all of the others during one year's competition.<ref>[http://www.pubquizhelp.34sp.com/sport/rugby_6_nations.html]</ref> The Grand Slam winners are awarded the Six Nations trophy (as tournament winners), but there is no special grand slam trophy &ndash; the Grand Slam is an informal honour recognizing a Championship-winning team which has won all his games.

Although the term ''[[Glossary of contract bridge terms#G|grand slam]]'' had long been in use in the game of [[contract bridge]], the first time that the expression is known to have been applied to [[rugby union]] was in 1957, in a preview of a match between England and Scotland:
{{quote|There is much more than usual at stake for England to-day in the match against Scotland at Twickenham... The last time when England achieved the Grand Slam under present conditions was as long ago as the 1927-28 season, but it is difficult to try to build up a case against her repeating the performance to-day.|''[[The Times]]'', 16 March 1957}}

The Grand Slam honour is applied retroactively to teams which won all of their matches in Five Nations tournaments before the term came into use. It is also applied to the [[1908 Home Nations Championship|1908]] and [[1909 Home Nations Championship|1909]] seasons, when matches with France took place during, but outside of, the then Home Nations Championships. However the Grand Slam honour is not applied to seasons in which only the four home nations were involved (1883<U+2013>1907 and 1932<U+2013>1939) <U+2013> in that case a team that won all its matches is said to have achieved the [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]]. This honour is still competed for between the four home nations within the Six Nations Championship.   

A Grand Slam was therefore available in the years 1908<U+2013>1931 and 1947<U+2013>1999 (Five Nations) and 2000<U+2013>2013 (Six Nations), a total of 91 seasons to date. Grand Slams were in fact achieved on 37 of these occasions &ndash; 12 by England, 11 by Wales, 9 by France, 3 by Scotland and 2 by Ireland. (Italy, involved in the tournament since 2000, have yet to win a Grand Slam.) 

Consecutive Grand Slams have been won by Wales in [[1908 Home Nations Championship|1908]]<U+2013>[[1909 Home Nations Championship|1909]], by England in [[1913 Five Nations Championship|1913]]<U+2013>[[1914 Five Nations Championship|1914]], [[1923 Five Nations Championship|1923]]<U+2013>[[1924 Five Nations Championship|1924]] and [[1991 Five Nations Championship|1991]]<U+2013>[[1992 Five Nations Championship|1992]], and by France in [[1997 Five Nations Championship|1997]]<U+2013>[[1998 Five Nations Championship|1998]]. No team has yet achieved three consecutive Grand Slams.

Prior to 2000, each team played four matches, two at home and two away from home. Following the inclusion of Italy in 2000, each team plays five matches, two at home and three away in one year, and the opposite in the following season. When [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] won the Grand Slam in 2005, it was the first time that the feat had been achieved by a team that had played more matches away than at home. This was repeated in 2009 with Ireland winning matches away to Italy, Scotland and Wales.

==Grand Slam tours==
A Grand Slam tour is one in which a touring national team from [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]], [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] or [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] plays [[Test match (rugby union)|Test]] matches against all four home nations ([[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] and [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]]). If the tourists win all four of these games, they are said to have achieved a Grand Slam. 

Grand Slams by touring teams have been achieved nine times: four times each by South Africa and New Zealand, and once by Australia. The only touring country to have achieved a "Five Nations" Grand Slam (defeating [[France national rugby union team|France]] in addition to the four home countries on the same tour) is South Africa, in its tours of [[1912<U+2013>13 South Africa rugby union tour|1912<U+2013>13]] and [[1951<U+2013>52 South Africa rugby union tour|1951<U+2013>52]].

Australia is the only country to suffer an unofficial "grand slam of defeats" against the four home nations, on their [[1957<U+2013>58 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France|1957&ndash;58 tour]]. 

After 1984, Southern Hemisphere sides started to tour the British Isles more frequently, but to play fewer Tests on each tour, and thus there were no Grand Slam tours between 1984 and 1998. However, since 1998 Grand Slam tours have become quite common again, as the number of Tests on each tour has again increased, although fewer matches are now played against club or provincial teams than was formerly the case on Grand Slam tours. For example, New Zealand played only Test matches in 2005 and 2010 and played only one non-Test in 2008 (a midweek match against [[Munster Rugby|Munster]] to commemorate Munster's defeat of the All Blacks in 1978, which had been their only loss on that tour). The All Blacks' tours of 2005 and 2008 were originally planned to include only three Test matches; the late inclusion of matches against Wales and England respectively turned these into Grand Slam tours.
