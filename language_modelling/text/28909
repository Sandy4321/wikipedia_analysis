The '''Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company''' (1860-1952), also known as TCI and the Tennessee Company,  was a major American [[steel mill|steel manufacturer]] with interests in [[coal mining|coal]] and [[iron ore]] mining and [[railroad operations]]. It was headquartered in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]]. With a sizable real estate portfolio, it owned the Birmingham satellite towns of [[Ensley, Birmingham, Alabama|Ensley]] and [[Fairfield, Alabama|Fairfield]], where it located two large steel milling plants. At one time the second largest steel producer in the USA in terms of assets and output<ref>http://www.britannica.com/eb/art-60932/Furnaces-of-the-Tennessee-Coal-Iron-and-Railroad-Company-Ensley</ref><ref>http://www.bhamrails.info/TCI/TIC_timeline.htm</ref>,the company merged with the [[United States Steel Corporation|United States Steel Corporation]] in 1907, from then onwards operating as a subsidiary of U.S. Steel until it became one of its divisions in 1952.
==History==
=== Early history ===

Founded in 1860 by entrepreneurial [[Nashville|Nashville]] and [[New York]] business interests seeking to exploit Tennessee's rich coal reserves and the 19th century railroad boom, the Tennessee Coal and Railroad Company (preceded by the Sewanee Mining Company, which had existed four years prior) began its existence mining and transporting coal around the towns of [[Cowan, Tennessee|Cowan]] and [[Tracy City]] in the [[Cumberland Mountains]], TN<ref>http://www.bhamrails.info/TCI/TIC_timeline_01.htm</ref>. This practice of both extracting and moving coal to market by building private rail tracks was not unusual at the time, as by owning the mines that their tracks served, railroad companies could undercut rivals with low transportation costs (it is worth noting that it was through this method that the hugely successful [[Standard Oil Trust]] gained a near-monopoly in the petroleum industry in the
late 19th century, though Rockefeller never owned the rails, he merely extracted concessions from their owners). The business was reorganized as the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and
Railroad Company in 1874 to reflect the recent acquisition of the Sewanee Furnace Company and the subsequent expansion into coke and iron manufacture. The company never again changed its name, despite a later expansion into the Birmingham region of Alabama following the 1886 purchase of the Pratt Coal and Iron Company. Such was the industrial importance of Alabama to TCI that in 1895, in recognition of the ascendancy of the region over Tennessee, the company relocated its offices to Birmingham, relegating its native state to relative industrial unimportance.
[[Image:Prattmines.jpg|thumb|left|Mines of Pratt Co., TCI's first purchase in Alabama and the catalyst for its ultimate relocation there]]
The corporation was for several decades one of the few major successful heavy industries based in the largely agricultural and textile-dependent postbellum [[Southern United States]]<ref>http://www.britannica.com/eb/art-60932/Furnaces-of-the-Tennessee-Coal-Iron-and-Railroad-Company-Ensley</ref>, by a wide margin the largest blast furnace operator in the South and at one time the second largest steel producer in the continent, with 17 blast furnaces, 3256 beehive and 120 [[Solvay Process Company|Solvay]] coke ovens, 15 red ore mines (in the Birmingham District - by 1899 the company had successfully researched how to effectively utilize high-[[phosphorous]] Birmingham iron ore<ref>http://www.bhamrails.info/TCI/TIC_timeline.htm</ref>)  and a network of railroads on its 1900 asset sheet. The TCI's largest industrial plant was located in Ensley, a company town founded in 1886 on the outskirts of Birmingham, Alabama, by [[Memphis]] entrepreneur and first president of Tennessee Coal, Iron and Rail, Enoch Ensley. Ensley ([http://www.bhamrails.info/TCI/Ensley_works/Ensley_works_01.htm/1892 map of]) was served by the company's railroads (TCI had just purchased the sizable [[Birmingham Southern Railroad]]) and contained four 200-ton [[blast furnace]]s, the largest such cluster in the world upon their erection in 1889. In 1906 two more furnaces were constructed and a record 40,000 tonnes of steel were produced that year, supplying Ensley's integrated rail, wire and plate mills. The company was fiercely competitive with the larger Pittsburgh steel companies to the north, owing to the remarkable fact that all the natural resources required to produce steel (namely coke and iron ore) were located in abundance within a relatively small radius of the Birmingham mills.

=== Listing on the Dow Jones Index and merger with US Steel ===
[[Image:Tenshare.jpg|thumb|right|1899 Certificate for 100 Shares in TCI issued to FW Gilley Jr. & Co.]]
The Tennessee Company's status was bolstered when it was listed on the first [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones Industrial Index]], compiled in 1896.  The sheer size of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company, as well as its privileged position on the exclusive Industrial Average, attracted the attention of banker and tycoon [[J.P. Morgan|J.P. Morgan]] and his recently formed conglomerate, the United States Steel Corporation, the USA's leading steel producer and the successor to the enormous [[Carnegie Steel Company|Carnegie]] and Federal steel empires. Morgan launched a successful takeover of TCI in a unique power play by exploiting a [[Panic of 1907|sudden financial panic in 1907]], acquiring tumbling TCI stocks from nervous shareholders in return for far safer U.S. Steel bonds. Morgan lied extensively to [[President Theodore Roosevelt]] about the nature of the merger<ref>Brogan 1999 p445</ref> by assuring the president that, by absorbing the Tennessee Company, Morgan could save the entire American economy from collapse, going so far as to call his gesture a 'public service'. Whilst there was a widespread recognition at the time that the buying of plummeting shares in healthy corporations by trusted individuals or organizations was a valid tactic to restore market confidence, the principle motive behind his appeal was to avoid any dangerous brush with the 1890 [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] (which in the past had crippled one of his earlier combinations, the [[Northern Securities Company]], in a landmark test case) by forcing Roosevelt, a notorious 'trust-buster', to grant the transaction antitrust immunity. Morgan's actions went some way to cool the stock market and in doing so, rewarded him with a lucrative prize. U.S. Steel immediately replaced Tennessee Coal, Iron and Rail on the Dow Jones Index, where it remained until 1991<ref>https://www.globalfinancialdata.com/articles/dow_jones.html</ref>. 

===As a subsidiary of U.S.S. Corp.===

[[Image:Untitleddada.jpg|thumb|left|Ensley iron furnaces, 1908]]
TCI was not fully incorporated into the U.S.S Corp., and continued to operate as an extremely profitable<ref>Brogan 1999 p445</ref>  subsidiary of its parent company well into the 20th century. Immediately following the merger, a venture was launched to create a new, larger TCI plant to the west of Ensley and at the center of a new company town, and so in 1910 work on the planned community of Corey, Alabama began. Named after an executive who later committed suicide, Corey was soon renamed Fairfield, and the steel works there opened in 1917. With the discovery of new coking coal and ore deposits in the region, and with the aid of U.S. Steel's enormous capital, the Fairfield works were quickly expanded with the construction of new steel mills and rail links. Notable developments included:
* 1917 - The completion of several rolling mills, producing ship materials for nearby shipbuilding plants in [[Chickasaw, Alabama]], in support of America's sudden entry into WWI
* 1920 - The opening of a direct rail line between Fairfield and [[Birmingport]], the new port of Birmingham on the [[Warrior River]]
* 1920 - The completion of the 'High Ore Line Railroad', connecting the [[Red Mountain (Birmingham, Alabama)|Red Mountain]] (aptly named for its rust-stained facade and rich seams of [[hematite]] iron ore) and the Fairfield works. Trains literally rolled down hill from mine to mill.
* 1923 - The completion of a merchant steel mill 
* 1926 - The opening of a sheet products mill
Whilst the new plant was located sufficiently close to Ensley not to necessitate workers from the old town having to relocate, the shift of capital from Ensley to Fairfield stifled the town's development and led to somewhat of a stagnation. Fairfield on the other hand enjoyed frantic population growth and development, with new schools, shops and churches being regularly constructed by the company in line with the scores of new mills and production facilities being opened in the plant.

TCI proved to be so efficient at milling cheap steel that a post-merger internal tariff (the 'Pittsburgh Tariff') was levied by U.S. Steel in 1909 against all steel coming out of the Birmingham region<ref>http://www.bhamrails.info/  (TCI & RR Co. section, page two)</ref>. The charge was implemented to negate the competitive edge of Birmingham steel over U.S. Steel's own Pittsburgh product, but intentionally or not the move destroyed a serious competitive advantage that the company held over the overall steel market. 

===As Tennessee Coal & Iron Division: United States Steel Corporation===
TCI's independence as a separate legal entity from its parent corporation ended in 1952 when the company became the Tennessee Coal & Iron Division of U.S. Steel, although the memory of the historic importance of TCI was not lost when, in 1960, a short book to celebrate the Tennessee Company's centenary was published by U.S.S. Corp.: ''Biography of a Business''. Decline began in 1962 when a majority of the mines in the Birmingham region were closed as cheap Venezuelan ores and foreign coal began to be favored by the steel business. The 1970s and 80s brought about a downsizing and eventual consolidation of the Fairfield and Ensley works, mirroring the general decline of heavy industry in the USA throughout those decades.

The last relic of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company, the Fairfield Plant, continues to be operated by U.S. Steel to this day (April 2008) as one of its five integrated steel mills in the United States. It is the largest steel-making plant in Alabama,<ref>http://www.steel.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Industry_News&TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&CONTENTID=23438</ref> employing 2000<ref>http://www.reliableplant.com/article.asp?articleid=2384</ref> workers as of September 2006, down from a peak of 45000 during WWII. With a single blast furnace and three [[Basic oxygen steelmaking| basic oxygen process furnaces]], amongst other various mills and production facilities, the plant produces 2.4 million tonnes of raw steel per annum<ref>http://www.ussteel.com/corp/facilities/fairfield.htm</ref> (compare to the 1906 yield of 40,000 tonnes) and 640,000 tonnes of seamless tubular and sheet products, mainly for purchase by the oil industry in the region.
