'''Sir George Henry Martin''' [[Commander of the British Empire|CBE]] (born [[3 January]] [[1926]] in [[Highbury]], [[London]], [[England]]) is sometimes referred to as "the [[Fifth Beatle]]"<U+2014>a title that he owes to his work as [[record producer|producer]] of almost all of [[The Beatles]]' records. 

During, and after, his work with The Beatles, Martin produced many other international acts through his ''Associated Independent Recording'' (AIR) company, which has studios in London and [[Montserrat]].

In recognition of his services to the music industry and [[popular culture]], he was made a [[Knight Bachelor]] of the [[Order of the British Empire|British Empire]] in 1996. He is the father of producer [[Giles Martin]], and actor [[Gregory Paul Martin]].

==Early years==
When he was six, Martin's family acquired a piano that sparked his interest in music.<ref name="Martin13"> Martin (All You Need Is Ears) 1994. p13</ref> At eight-years-old, Martin convinced his parents that he should take piano lessons, but those ended after only eight lessons because of a disagreement between his mother and the teacher. After that, Martin explained that he, "just picked it up by myself."<ref name="Martin14"> Martin (All You Need Is Ears) 1994. p14</ref> 

He attended multiple schools as a child, including a "convent school in Holloway", St. Joseph's elementary school in [[Highgate]], and St. Ignatius College in [[Stamford Hill]], to which he won a scholarship.<ref name="Martin15"> Martin (All You Need Is Ears) 1994. p15</ref> When war broke out and St. Ignatius College students were evacuated to Welwyn Garden City, his family left London and he was enrolled at Bromley Grammar School.<ref name="Martin15"> Martin (All You Need Is Ears) 1994. p15</ref>

{{cquote | I remember well the very first time I heard a symphony orchestra. I was just in my teens when Sir Adrian Boult brought the BBC Symphony Orchestra to my school for a public concert.  It was absolutely magical. Hearing such glorious sounds I found it difficult to connect them with ninety men and women blowing into brass and wooden instruments or scraping away at strings with horsehair bows.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/listenup/messages.shtml A lifelong love affair with the orchestra] bbc.co.uk - Retrieved: 21 September 2007 </ref>}}

Despite Martin's continued interest in music, and "fantasies about being the next [[Rachmaninov]]", he did not initially choose music as a career.<ref name="Martin17"> Martin (All You Need Is Ears) 1994. p17</ref> He worked briefly as a [[quantity surveyor]] and then for the [[War Office]] as a Temporary Clerk (Grade Three) which meant filing paperwork and making tea.<ref name="Martin18"> Martin (All You Need Is Ears) 1994. p18</ref> In 1943, when he was seventeen, he joined the [[Fleet Air Arm]] and became a pilot and a commissioned officer. The war ended before Martin was involved in any combat, and he left the service in 1947.<ref name="Martin25-28"> Martin (All You Need Is Ears) 1994. pp25-28</ref> Encouraged by Sidney Harrison (a member of the Committee for the Promotion of New Music) Martin used his veteran's grant to attend the [[Guildhall School of Music]] from 1947-50, where he studied piano and oboe, and was interested in the music of Rachmaninov and [[Ravel]], as well as [[Cole Porter]] and [[Johnny Dankworth]]. Martin's oboe teacher was Margaret Asher (the mother of [[Jane Asher]], who would later have a relationship with [[Paul McCartney]]).<ref name="Spitzp296"> Spitz 2005. p296</ref><ref name="Spitzp438"> Spitz 2005. p438</ref><ref name="Martin18-25"> Martin (All You Need Is Ears) 1994. pp18-25</ref> On [[3 January]], [[1948]]<U+2014>whilst still at the Academy<U+2014>Martin married Sheena Chisholm, with whom he had two children: Alexis, and Gregory. He later married Judy Lockhart-Smith, [[24 June]] [[1966]], and they also had two children: Lucy, and Giles.<ref name="George Martin Biog">[http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608000583/George-Martin.html George Martin<U+2019>s Biography]  musicianguide.com - Retrieved: 23 September 2007 </ref>

===Parlophone===
[[Image:Parlophone LP PMC 1202.jpg|thumb|left|150px| The Beatles<U+2019> first Parlophone LP <U+2013> produced by Martin.]]
Following his graduation, he worked for the [[BBC]]'s [[European classical music|classical music]] department, then joined [[EMI]] in [[1950]], as an assistant to Oscar Preuss, the head of EMI's [[Parlophone Records]] from 1950-55. Although having been regarded by EMI as a vital German imprint in the past, it was then seen as a joke and only used for EMI's insignificant acts.<ref name="Spitzp296"> Spitz 2005. p296</ref><ref name="Martin28-29"> Martin (All You Need Is Ears) 1994. pp28-29</ref> After taking over Parlophone when Preuss retired in 1955, Martin spent his first years with the [[record label]] recording classical and [[Baroque]] music, [[original cast recording]]s of hit plays, and regional music from around the British Isles.<ref name="Martin63"> Martin (All You Need Is Ears) 1994. p63</ref><ref name="Martin84-85"> Martin (All You Need Is Ears) 1994. pp84-85</ref> Martin also produced numerous [[comedy]] and [[novelty record|novelty]] records<U+2014>working with [[Peter Sellers]], [[Spike Milligan]], [[Rolf Harris]], [[Flanders and Swann]] and [[Shirley Abicair]].<ref name="martin-ears-85-96-97-103">{{cite book ||author=George Martin |title=All You Need Is Ears |year=1994 |pages=85-96, 97-103}}</ref> Martin worked with the [[Vipers Skiffle Group]], with whom he had a number of hits. In early 1962, under the pseudonym "Ray Cathode", Martin released an early electronic dance single, "[[Time Beat]]"<U+2014>recorded at the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]]<U+2014>in much the same style as the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' theme tune. As Martin wanted to add [[rock and roll]] to Parlophone's repertoire, he struggled to find a "fireproof", [[hit record|hit-making]] pop artist or group.<ref name="Miles330-331"> Miles 1997. p330-331</ref> 

As an arranger Martin scored a two-man show featuring [[Michael Flanders]] and [[Donald Swann]] called [[At the Drop of a Hat]], which sold steadily for twenty-five years, although Martin's breakthrough as an arranger came with the [[Beyond the Fringe]] show, which starred [[Peter Cook]], [[Dudley Moore]] and [[Jonathan Miller]]. Martin's work transformed the profile of Parlophone from a "sad little company" to a very profitable business.<ref name="Spitzp297"> Spitz 2005. p297</ref>

==The Beatles==
[[Image:Martin McCartney and Lennon.JPG|thumb|right|200px| Martin previewing a song by McCartney and Lennon in 1963.]]
Martin was contacted by Sid Coleman who told him about the manager of a pop group he had met whom he thought Martin might be interested in, even though the group had been turned down by [[Decca Records]] and most of the major British labels. Until that time Martin had had only minor success with pop music, such as "''Who Could Be Bluer''" by [[Jerry Lordan]], and singles with [[Shane Fenton]]. After the telephone call by Coleman Martin arranged a meeting on [[13 February]] [[1962]], with [[Brian Epstein]].<ref name="Spitzp297-298"> Spitz 2005. pp297-298</ref> Martin listened to a tape recorded at Decca, and thought that Epstein's group was "rather unpromising", but liked the sound of McCartney and Lennon's vocals.<ref name="Spitzp301"> Spitz 2005. p301</ref> 

After another meeting with Epstein on [[9 May]] at the [[Abbey Road studios]], Martin was impressed with Epstein's enthusiasm and agreed to sign the unknown Beatles to a recording contract without having met them or seen them play live.<ref name="Miles90"> Miles 1997. p90</ref> The contract was not what it seemed, however, as Martin would not sign it himself until he had heard an audition, and later said that EMI had "nothing to lose", as it offered one [[penny]] for each record sold, which was split amongst the four members, meaning one [[British Farthing coin|farthing]] per group member.<ref name="Spitzp312"> Spitz 2005. p312</ref> Martin suggested to EMI (after the release of [[From Me to You]]) that the royalty rate should be doubled without asking for anything in return, which led to Martin being thought of as a "traitor in EMI".<ref name="Spitzp414"> Spitz 2005. p414</ref> 

The Beatles auditioned for Martin on [[6 June]] [[1962]], in studio three at the Abbey Road studios.<ref name="Martin120-123"> Martin (All You Need Is Ears) 1994. pp120-123</ref> Ron Richards and his engineer [[Norman Smith]] recorded four songs, which Martin (who was not present during the recording) listened to at the end of the session. The verdict was not promising, however, as Richards complained about [[Pete Best]]'s drumming, and Martin thought their original songs were simply not good enough.<ref name="Miles90"> Miles 1997. p90</ref> Martin asked the individual Beatles if there was anything they personally didn't like, to which Harrison replied, "I don't like your tie". That was the turning point, according to Smith, as McCartney and Lennon joined in with jokes and comic wordplay that made Martin think that he should sign them to a contract for their wit alone.<ref name="Spitzp318-319"> Spitz 2005. pp318-319</ref>

The Beatles' first recording session with Martin was on [[4 September]], when they recorded "How Do You Do It", which Martin thought was a sure-fire hit even though Lennon and McCartney hated it.<ref name="Lewisohnp7"> Lewisohn 1990. p7</ref> Richards complained about new-member Starr's drumming on the next song, [[Love Me Do]], and so on 11 September, they re-recorded Love Me Do with [[Andy White (drummer)|Andy White]]. Starr was asked to play tambourine and maracas, and although he complied, he was definitely "not pleased".<ref name="Spitzp353"> Spitz 2005. p353</ref> Love Me Do peaked at #17 in the British charts, so on [[26 November]] [[1962]] Martin recorded "[[Please Please Me]]", which he only did after Lennon and McCartney had almost begged him to record another of their original songs. After the recording Martin looked over the mixing desk and said, "Gentlemen, you have just made your first number one record".<ref name="Spitzp360"> Spitz 2005. p360</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/songlibrary/pleasepleaseme.shtml "Congratulations, gentlemen, you've just made your first number one."] bbc.co.uk - Retrieved: 21 September 2007 </ref> Martin directed Epstein to find a good publisher<U+2014>as Ardmore & Beechwood had done nothing to promote Love Me Do<U+2014>telling Epstein about three publishers who, in Martin's opinion, would be fair and honest, which led them to [[Dick James]].<ref name="Spitzp364"> Spitz 2005. p364</ref>

===As arranger===
[[Image:Abbey road studios.jpg|thumb|left|200px| [[Abbey Road Studios]], where Martin recorded Parlophone's artists.]]
Martin's musical expertise helped fill the gaps between the Beatles' raw talent and the sound they wanted to achieve. Most of The Beatles' [[orchestra]]l arrangements and instrumentation (as well as frequent keyboard parts on the early records) were written or performed by Martin in collaboration with the band.<ref name="Miles205"> Miles 1997. p205</ref> It was Martin's idea to put a string quartet on [[Yesterday (song)|Yesterday]], against McCartney's initial reluctance.<ref name="Miles205"> Miles 1997. p205</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/songlibrary/indepth/yesterday.shtml <U+201C>What about a classical string quartet?<U+201D>] bbc.co.uk - Retrieved: 21 September 2007 </ref> Martin played the song in the style of [[Bach]] to show McCartney the voicings that were available.<ref name="Miles206"> Miles 1997. p206</ref> Another example is the song "[[Penny Lane]]", which featured a [[trumpet|piccolo trumpet]] solo. McCartney hummed the melody he wanted, and Martin wrote it down in music notation for [[David Mason]], the classically trained trumpeter.<ref name="Lewisohnp93"> Lewisohn 1990. p93</ref>

Martin's distinctive arranging work appears on multiple Beatles recordings. For "[[Eleanor Rigby]]" he scored and conducted a strings-only accompaniment inspired by [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s music for ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]''.<ref name="Lewisohnp77"> Lewisohn 1990. p77</ref> On a Canadian speaking tour in 2007, Martin said his "Eleanor Rigby" score was also influenced by the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] thriller, [[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]].<ref name="MacDonald163"> MacDonald 1994. p163</ref> 

For "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]", he and [[Geoff Emerick]] turned two very different takes into a single master through careful use of [[vari-speed]] and editing.<ref name="Lewisohnp90-91"> Lewisohn 1990. pp90-91</ref> For "[[I Am the Walrus]]", he provided a quirky and original arrangement for brass, violins, cellos, and the [[Mike Sammes|Mike Sammes Singers]] vocal ensemble.<ref name="Miles357"> Miles 1997. p357</ref><ref name="Lewisohnp93"> Lewisohn 1990. p127</ref><ref name="MacDonald216"> MacDonald 1994. p216</ref> On "[[In My Life]]", he played a sped-up [[Baroque]] [[piano]] solo.<ref name="Lewisohnp65"> Lewisohn 1990. p65</ref> He worked with McCartney to implement the orchestral 'windup' in "[[A Day in the Life]]" and he and McCartney shared conducting duties the day it was recorded.<ref name="Miles326-328"> Miles 1997. p326-328</ref>

He contributed less-noted but integral parts to other songs, including the piano in "[[Lovely Rita]]",<ref name="MacDonald189-190"> MacDonald 1994. pp189-190</ref> the circus instrumentation in "[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite]]", and the orchestration in "[[Good Night (song)|Good Night]]".<ref name="Lewisohnp99"> Lewisohn 1990. p99</ref><ref name="Miles318"> Miles 1997. p318</ref><ref name="Lewisohnp144"> Lewisohn 1990. p144</ref>

The first song that Martin did not arrange was [[She's Leaving Home]], as he had a prior engagement to produce a [[Cilla Black]] session, so McCartney contacted arranger [[Mike Leander]] to do it. Martin was reportedly hurt by this, but still produced the recording and conducted the orchestra himself.<ref name="Miles317"> Miles 1997. p317</ref> Martin was in demand as an independent arranger and producer by the time of [[The Beatles (album)|The White Album]], so The Beatles were left to produce various tracks by themselves.<ref name="Miles491"> Miles 1997. p491</ref>

Martin arranged the score for the Beatles' film ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]''<ref name="Martin226-230"> Martin (All You Need Is Ears) 1994. pp226-230</ref> and the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'', for which [[Paul McCartney]] wrote and sang the title song.<ref name="Martin231-232"> Martin (All You Need Is Ears) 1994. pp231-232</ref>

===The Beatles Anthology===
Martin oversaw post-production on ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' in 1994 and 1995, working again with [[recording engineer]] [[Geoff Emerick]], but stepped down when it came to producing the two new singles to be included (reuniting McCartney, Harrison and Starr, to overdub two old Lennon demos). Martin had suffered a hearing loss, and left the work to writer/producer [[Jeff Lynne]] of [[Electric Light Orchestra|ELO]] fame.<ref>[http://www.4hearingloss.com/archives/2005/10/mccartney_marti.html Martin's hearing loss] 4hearingloss.com - Retrieved: 23 September 2007 </ref><ref>[http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/sgt-pepper/features/beatles-producer-george-martin  <U+201C>handed over further duties to ELO supremo Jeff Lynne<U+201D>] icons.org.uk  - Retrieved: 23 September 2007 </ref>

In 2006, Martin and his son, [[Giles Martin]], remixed 80 minutes of Beatle music for the stage performance ''[[Love (Cirque du Soleil)|Love]]'', a joint venture between [[Cirque du Soleil]] and the Beatles' [[Apple Corps|Apple Corps Ltd]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6159426.stm Love unveils new angle on Beatles] bbc.co.uk - Retrieved: 21 September 2007 </ref> A [[Love (The Beatles album)|soundtrack album from the show]] was released in [[2006]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/news/20061117_lovealbum.shtml Legendary producer returns to Abbey Road] bbc.co.uk - Retrieved: 21 September 2007 </ref>

==Other artists==
Martin has produced recordings for many other artists, including contemporaries of [[the Beatles]] such as [[Cilla Black]] and [[Gerry and the Pacemakers]], as well as the band [[America (band)|America]],<ref name="Martin246-247"> Martin (All You Need Is Ears) 1994. pp246-247</ref> guitarist [[Jeff Beck]], sixties duo [[Edwards Hand]], [[Ultravox]] country-singer [[Kenny Rogers]], and with [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki Hayashi]].<ref>{{cite web | title=''Eternal Melody'' release information | work=cdjapan.co.jp | url=http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=UPCH-1139}} - Retrieved: 21 September 2007</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Article on Hideto Matsumoto's death | work=nytimes.com | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00EFD7103DF93BA25755C0A96E958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all}} - Retrieved: 21 September 2007 </ref>

Martin also worked with the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]] and [[Gary Glitter]]. He worked with Glitter before he was famous, and recorded several songs with him in the 1960s under the name of "Paul Raven". He also produced the 1974 album [[The Man In The Bowler Hat (album)|The Man In The Bowler Hat]] for the eccentric British folk-rock group [[Stackridge]].<ref>[http://www.stackridge.net/history.htm Stackridge web page] stackridge.net - Retrieved on 19 September 2007 </ref>

==Associated Independent Recording (AIR)==
Within the recording industry, Martin is noted for going independent at a time when many producers were still salaried [[Employment|staff]]<U+2014>which he was until the Beatles' success gave him the leverage to start, in 1965, Associated Independent Recording, and hire out his own services to artists who requested him. This arrangement not only demonstrated how important Martin's talents were considered to be by his artists, but it  allowed him a share in record royalties on his hits.<ref name="Martin179-185"> Martin (All You Need Is Ears) 1994. pp179-185</ref> Today, Martin's [[Associated Independent Recording]] (AIR)<U+2014>established in 1965<U+2014>remains one of the world's pre-eminent recording studios.<ref>[http://www.airstudios.com/home.shtml Air studios web page] airstudios.com - Retrieved on 19 September 2007 </ref> Martin later opened a studio in Montserrat, in 1979.<ref name="George Martin Biog"/>

==Books and audio retrospective==
In 1979, he published a memoir, ''[[All You Need is Ears]]'' (co-written with Jeremy Hornsby), that described his work with the Beatles and other artists (including [[Peter Sellers]], [[Sophia Loren]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Flanders and Swann]], [[Matt Monro]], and [[Dudley Moore]]), and gave an informal introduction to the art and science of [[sound recording]]. In 1993 Martin published ''With a Little Help from My Friends: The Making of Sgt Pepper'' (published in UK as ''Summer of Love: The Making of Sgt Pepper'', co-authored with William Pearson).<ref>{{cite book |author=George Martin |title=With a Little Help from My Friends |year=1994}}</ref><ref>[http://www.genesis-publications.com/books/summer_of_love/index.html Summer Of Love] genesis-publications.com - Retrieved: 23 September 2007</ref>  Martin also edited a 1983 book called ''Making Music: The Guide to Writing, Performing and Recording''.

In 2001, Martin released ''[[Produced by George Martin]]: 50 Years In Recording'', a 6-CD retrospective of his entire studio career, and in 2002, Martin launched ''Playback'', his limited-edition illustrated autobiography, published by [[Genesis Publications]].<ref>[http://www.genesis-publications.com/books/playback/ Playback - An Illustrated Memoir] genesis-publications.com - Retrieved: 23 September 2007</ref>
