The '''Parthenon frieze''' is the low relief, [[penteli]]c marble sculpture created to adorn the upper part of the [[Parthenon]]<U+2019>s [[Cella|naos]]. It was sculpted between ca. 443 and 438 BC,<ref>438 was the year of the dedication of the Parthenon and is usually taken as an upper limit for completion of the frieze, see I Jenkins, ''The Parthenon Frieze and Perikles' cavalry of 1000'', p149<U+2013>150, in Hurwit, 2005, for a discussion of the dating problem.</ref> most likely under the direction of [[Pheidias]]. Of the {{convert|524|ft}} of the original frieze, {{convert|420|ft}} survives&mdash;some 80 percent.<ref>Jenkins, 2002, p.49</ref> The rest is known only from the drawings made by French artist [[Jacques Carrey]] in 1674, thirteen years before the [[Parthenon#Later history|Venetian bombardment]] that ruined the temple.

At present, the majority of the frieze is at the [[British Museum]] in [[London]] (forming the major part of the [[Elgin Marbles]]); the largest proportion of the rest is in [[Acropolis Museum|Athens]], and the remainder of fragments shared between six other institutions.<ref>80m in London and 50m in [[Acropolis Museum|Athens]] according to the Greek Culture Ministry's website [http://www.parthenonfrieze.gr/#/view/tour0 accessed 27.6.2010].

It was 160 meters in length (524&nbsp;ft) when complete, as well as 1 meter in height, and it projects 5.6&nbsp;cm forward at its maximum depth. It is composed of 114 blocks of an average 1.22 meters in length, depicting two parallel files in procession. It was a particular novelty of the Parthenon that the [[cella]] carries an [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[frieze]] over the [[hexastyle]] [[pronaos]] rather than [[Doric order|Doric]] [[metope (architecture)|metopes]] as would have been expected of a Doric temple. Judging by the existence of regulae and [[guttae]] below the frieze on the east wall this was an innovation introduced late in the building process and replaced the ten metopes and [[triglyph]]s that might otherwise have been placed there.<ref>Neils, 2001, p.38</ref>

The marble was quarried from Mt. [[Pentelikon]] and transported 19&nbsp;km to the [[acropolis of Athens]]. A persistent question has been whether it was carved ''[[in situ#Art|in situ]]''.<ref>Neils, 2001, p.77, also note 8 for the historiography of the problem.</ref> Just below the moulding and above the tenia there is a channel 17&nbsp;mm high that would have served to give access to the sculptor's chisel when finishing the heads or feet on the relief; this scamillus or guide strip is the best evidence there is that the blocks were carved on the wall. Additionally, on practical grounds it is easier to move a sculptor than a sculpture, and to [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] them into place could have potentially chipped the edges.<ref>Neils, 2001, p.77</ref> No information is recoverable on the workshop, but estimates range from three to 80 sculptors on the basis of style, however Jenifer Neils suggests nine on the grounds that this would be the least number necessary to produce the work in the time given.<ref>Neils, 2001, p.87</ref> It was finished with metal detailing and painted. No colour, however, survives, but the background was perhaps blue judging by comparison with grave stelae and the paint remnants on the frieze of the [[Temple of Hephaestus|Hephaisteion]].<ref>Neils, 2001, p.88 "It is generally assumed that the background of the frieze was painted blue, on analogy with the blue background of other fifth-century relief sculptures, namely, grave stelae. Perhaps the closest comparison is with the Hephaisteion frieze, which according to several early travellers to Greece preserved traces of a blue background in addition to other paint<U+2026>The Elusinian limestone used for the background of the Erechtheion frieze is also dark blue in colour. Thus, we can safely assume that at least the background of the Parthenon frieze was more or less as the nineteenth-century Dutch painter Alma-Tadema depicted it."</ref> Possibly figures held objects that were also rendered in paint such as [[Poseidon]]<U+2019>s trident and the laurel in [[Apollo]]<U+2019>s hand.<ref>Neils, 2001, p.90</ref> The many drill holes found in Apollo<U+2019>s and [[Hera]]<U+2019>s heads indicate that a gilded bronze wreath would probably have crowned the gods.<ref>Neils, 2001, p.91</ref>

The system of numbering the frieze blocks dates back to [[Adolf Michaelis]]'s 1871 work ''Der Parthenon'', and since then [[Ian Jenkins (curator)|Ian Jenkins]] has revised this scheme in the light of recent discoveries.<ref>Jenkins, 1994, pp.50<U+2013>1</ref><ref>Particularly the manuscript of Francis Vernon of 1675, describing the frieze prior to the Venetian bombardment which shed new light on the Carrey drawings of 1674, see Bowie, Thimme, 1971, and B.D. Meritt, The Epigraphic notes of Francis Vernon, in Commemorative Studies in Honor of Theodore Leslie Shear (Hesperia Suppl. 8, Princeton 1949)</ref> The convention, here preserved, is that blocks are numbered in [[Roman numerals|Roman]] and figures in [[Arabic numerals]], the figures are numbered left to right against the direction of the procession on the north and west and with it on the south.

==Description==

[[File:Elgin Marbles5.jpg|thumb|left|300px|West frieze, XLVII, 132<U+2013>136, British Museum]]

The narrative of the frieze begins at the southwest corner where the procession appears to divide into two separate files. The first third of the west frieze is not part of the procession but instead seems to be the preparatory stages for the participants. The first figure here is a [[marshal]] dressing, W30, followed by several men preparing the horses W28<U+2013>23 until figure W22 who, it has been suggested,<ref>Robertson, Frantz, 1975, notes to plate 9.</ref> may be engaged in the ''dokimasia'', the tryout or enrollment of the [[knights]].<ref>however Bugh, 1988 however, has argued that the scene is unrelated to the military and specific to the religious procession, see Neils, 2001, p.128</ref> W24 is an ambiguous figure who might be either the protesting owner of a rejected horse or a ''keryx'' (herald) whose hand held part of an otherwise lost ''salpinx'' (trumpet), but either way this point marks the beginning of the procession proper.<ref name="Neils, 2001, p.132">Neils, 2001, p.132</ref>

The following ranks W21<U+2013>1 along with N75<U+2013>136 and S1<U+2013>61 are all of horsemen and constitute 46% of the whole frieze.<ref name="Neils, 2001, p.132"/> They are divided into two lines of ten ranks <U+2013> the same number of the Attic tribes.<ref>The Athenian [[cavalry]] was organised by tribe of ''phylai'' and commanded by ten officers known as ''phlyarchs''</ref> All are beardless youths with the exception of two, W8 and W15, who along with S2<U+2013>7 wear [[Thracians|Thracian]] dress of fur cap, a patterned cloak and high boots; these have been identified by [[Martin Robertson]] as ''hipparchs''.<ref>Robertson, Frantz, 1975, p.46</ref> Next are the four-horse [[chariots]], each with charioteer and armed passenger, there are ten on the south frieze and eleven on the north. Since these passengers are sometimes depicted as dismounting they may be taken to represent the ''apobatai'', participants in the ceremonial race found in [[Attica]] and [[Boeotia]].<ref>Kyle, 1993, see Neils, 2001, p.138</ref>

By N42 and S89 the equestrian parade is at an end, and the following 16 figures on the north and 18 on the south are taken to be the elders of Athens judging by their braided hair, an attribute of distinguished age in Classical art. Four of these figures raise their right hand in a clenched fist gesture suggestive of a pose associated with the ''thallophoroi'' (olive branch bearers) who were older men chosen for their good looks in competition. No drill holes, however, exist for any branch to be inserted in their hands. Next in line (S107<U+2013>114, N20<U+2013>28) are the musicians: four kithara (a variant of the [[lyre]]) and four aulos (flute) players. N16<U+2013>19 and S115<U+2013>118 (conjectured) are the ''hydriaphoroi'', the water-vessel carriers, here men rather than [[metic]] girls mentioned in the literature on the [[Panathenaia]]. N13<U+2013>15, S119<U+2013>121 are the ''skaphephoroi'', the tray bearers of the honeycombs and cakes used to entice the sacrificial animals to the altar. N1<U+2013>12, S122<U+2013>149 are the ten cows on the north and four cows and four sheep on the south meant for sacrifice on the [[acropolis]], presumably an abbreviated form of the [[hecatomb]] usually offered on this occasion <U+2013> there is an a-b-a rhythm of placid and restive cows.<ref>Neils, 2001, p.154</ref>

As the files converge on the east frieze we encounter the first women celebrants E2<U+2013>27, E50<U+2013>51, E53<U+2013>63. They carry the sacrificial instruments and paraphernalia including the ''phiale'' ([[phial]] or jug), ''oinochoai'' (wine jars), ''thymiaterion'' ([[incense]] burner), and in the case of E50<U+2013>51 they have evidently just handed the marshal E49 a ''kanoun'', making the girl the [[kanephoros]].<ref>Roccos, 1999, pp.641<U+2013>66.</ref> The next groups E18<U+2013>23, E43<U+2013>46, are problematic. Six on the left and four on the right, if one does not count two other figures who may or may not be marshals, then this group might be taken to be the ten [[eponym]]ous heroes who gave their names to the ten tribes. Their proximity to the gods indicates their importance, but selecting differently then nine of them may be the [[archon]]s of the [[polis]] or ''athlothetai'' officials who managed the procession; there is insufficient iconographic evidence to determine which interpretation is correct. The twelve seated gods are taken to be the Olympians, they are one third taller than any other figure on the frieze and are arranged in two groups of six on ''[[diphros|diphroi]]'' (backless) stools, common forms of [[Ancient Furniture|ancient furniture]], with the exception of [[Zeus]] who is enthroned. Their backs are turned to what must be the culminating event of the procession E31<U+2013>35; five figures (three children and two adults, and though badly corroded the two children on the left are probably girls) the girls bear objects on their heads,<ref>Either baskets, Wesenberg, 1995, or stools, Boardman, 1999, pp.305<U+2013>330</ref> while a third, probably a boy,<ref>Brommer,1977, pp.269<U+2013>70 identifies the existence of a temple boy of Athena in Athens, see also Harrison, ''The Web of History: A conservative reading of the Parthenon Frieze'' in Neils, 1996, p.204</ref> assists an adult who may be the ''archon basileus'', in folding a piece of cloth. This is usually understood to be the presentation of [[Athena]]<U+2019>s [[peplos]], perhaps by the [[Arrephoros|arrhephoroi]].<ref>While it is largely uncontroversial (pace Connelly) that this scene is the presentation of the peplos, since that was the purpose of the Panathenaic procession, the identification of these figures is not. It may be that the two girls, E 31-2, are the diphrophoroi, metic girls who carried the stools for the kanephoroi, but Neils, 2001, p.168 dismisses this argument since they evidently play a central role in the cult of Athena here. She also notes that the arrephoroi were involved in the weaving of the peplos, specifically warping the looms for it during the festival of Chalkeia nine months earlier. The figure E35 was identified as a girl by Stuart and Revett, an ascription repudiated by Adolf Michaelis in 1871. That this figure was a boy was the orthodox interpretation until Martin Robertson pointed out the presence of venus rings on her neck, Robertson, Frantz, 1975. See also Neils, 2001, p.169.</ref>

==Style==
[[File:Cavalcade south frieze Parthenon BM n2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Cavalcade south frieze, X XI, 26<U+2013>28, British Museum.]]

The Parthenon frieze is the defining monument of the [[High Classical style]] of Attic sculpture.<ref>As Neils, 2001, p.95 notes, "for many it represents the epitome of the high Classical Style", however Cook, 1976, p.124 makes the useful qualification, "For the character of the High Classical Style it is easy to rely too much on the architectural sculpture of the Parthenon, since they form the only large body of original work of first-rate quality that has survived".</ref> It stands between the gradual eclipse of the [[Severe style]] as witnessed on the Parthenon metopes<ref>Ridgway, 1981, p.16, "it is certainly true that most of the South metopes... retain distinctive traits of the Severe style. This feature is best explained, however, in terms of lingering tradition, and it is quite possible that the various Fifth century styles developed in the process of carving, since highly advanced details can be noticed in whatever remains of some other metopes, or, for that matter, in some of the South series as well."</ref> and the evolution of the Late Classical [[Rich style]] exemplified by the [[Temple of Athena Nike|Nike balustrade]]. What sources the designer of the frieze drew upon is hard to gauge, certainly large scale narrative art was familiar to 5th century Athenians as in the [[Stoa poikile]] painting by [[Polygnotos]] of Thasos. While there is an overall coherence to the work there are design differences on opposing sides of the frieze which has suggested to some scholars the possibility of more than one designer and a pattern of influence amongst them.<ref>Neils, 2001, p.70</ref> There is greater nudity and frontally on the north than the south, the massing and distribution of figures is greatly different on the east than the more widely spaced west, and the east and north generally exhibit greater innovation. This evidence, along with the frequency with Greek artists were seen to collaborate, has led Jennifer Neils to hypothesize the existence of two designers working on the sculpture.<ref>Neils, 2001, p.71</ref> This would admit the possibility of a later designer comparing and competing with the earlier and so explain the observable changes in composition.

This period is one of discovery of the expressive possibilities of the human body; there is a greater freedom in the poses and gestures, and an increased attention to anatomical verisimilitude as may be observed in the ponderated stances of the figures W9 and W4 who partially anticipate the ''[[Doryphoros]]'' of [[Polykleitos]]. There is a noticeable ease to the physiques of the frieze compared with the stiffness of the metopes along with an eye for such subtleties as knuckle joints, veins and the careful articulation of musculature. One important innovation of the style is the use of drapery as an expression of motion or to suggest the body beneath; in archaic and early classical sculpture clothing fell over the body as if it were a curtain obscuring the form below, now there is the billowing chlamydes of the horsemen or the multi-pleated peploi of the women which lends a surface movement and tension to their otherwise static poses. The variation in the manes of the horses has been of particular interest to scholars attempting to discern the artistic personalities of the sculptors who laboured on the frieze,<ref>Schuchhardt, 1930, pp.218<U+2013>80, detects 79 individual sculptors.</ref> so far this [[Giovanni Morelli|Morellian]] analysis has been without conclusion.

==Interpretation==

[[File:Sacrifice south frieze Parthenon BM.jpg|thumb|right|Cattle led to sacrifice, South XLV, 137<U+2013>140, British Museum.]]

As no description of the frieze survives from antiquity, the question of the meaning of the sculpture has been a persistent and unresolved one. The first published attempt at interpretation belongs to [[Ciriaco Pizzicolli|Cyriac of Ancona]] in the 15th century AD who referred to it as the <U+201C>victories of Athens in the time of [[Pericles]]<U+201D>.<ref>Cyriac of Ancona, 2003, p19</ref> What is now the orthodox view of the piece, however, namely that it depicts the Greater [[Panathenaic Games|Panathenaic]] procession from [[Eleusinian Mysteries|Eleusis]] to Athens, was mooted by [[James Stuart (1713<U+2013>1788)|Stuart]] and [[Nicholas Revett|Revett]] in the second volume of their ''Antiquities of Athens'', 1787.<ref>Stuart, Revett, 2002, p.31</ref> Subsequent interpretations have largely built on this theory even if they disallow that a temple sculpture could represent a contemporary event rather than a mythological or historical one. It has only been in recent years that an alternative thesis in which the frieze depicts the [[founding myth]] of the city of Athens instead of the festival ''pompe'' has emerged.

[[File:Persepolis stairs of the Apadana relief.jpg|thumb|left|Procession of tributes from the Apadana, Persepolis, 1st half 5th C., inspiration for the Parthenon Frieze?]]

The contention that the scene is a document of Athena<U+2019>s festival is fraught with problems. Later sources indicate that a number of classes of individual who performed a role in the procession are not present in the frieze, these include: the [[hoplites]], the allies in the [[Delian league]], the ''skiaphoroi'' or umbrella bearers, the female ''hydraiphoroi'' (only male hydrai bearers are portrayed) ''thetes'', slaves, metics, the panathenaic ship and some would suggest the kanephoros, though there is evidence that she is accounted for.<ref>Ross Holloway, 1966, pp.223<U+2013>226 lists the testemonia for the Panathenaic procession</ref> That what we now see was meant to be a generic image of the religious festival is problematic since no other temple sculpture depicts a contemporary event involving mortals. Locating the scene in mythical or historical time has been the principal difficulty of the line of inquiry. [[John Boardman (archaeologist)|John Boardman]] has suggested that the cavalry portray the heroization of the ''marathonomachoi'', the hoplites who fell at [[battle of Marathon|Marathon]] in 490, and that therefore these riders were the Athenians who took part in the last pre-war Greater Panathenaia.<ref>J. Boardman, The Parthenon Frieze <U+2013> another look, in Festschrift fur Frank Brommer, p.39<U+2013>49, 1977</ref> In support, he points out, the number of horsemen, chariot passengers (but not charioteers), grooms and marshals comes to the same as the number Herodotos gives for the Athenian dead: 192. Equally suggestive of a reference to the Persian War is the similarity several scholars have noted of the frieze to the [[Apadana]] sculpture in [[Persepolis]]. This has variously been posited to be democratic Athens counter posing itself to oriental tyranny<ref>Lawrence, 1951, pp.116<U+2013>19, also Ashmole, 1972, p.117</ref> or aristocratic Athens emulating the Imperial East.<ref>Root, 1989, pp.103<U+2013>20.</ref> Further to this zeitgeist argument there is J.J. Politt<U+2019>s contention that the frieze embodies a Periclean manifesto, which favours the cultural institutions of ''agones'' (or contests, as witnessed by the ''apobatai''), sacrifices and military training as well as a number of other democratic virtues.<ref>Pollitt, 1972, p.87.</ref> More recent scholarship pursuing this vein has made the frieze a site of ideological tension between the elite and the ''demos'' with perhaps only the aristocracy present and merely veiled reference to the ten tribes.<ref>See L. Maurizio, ''The Panathenaic Procession:Athens' Participatory Democracy on Display?'', in Boedeker, 1998</ref>

[[File:Peplos scene BM EastV cropped.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The so-called peplos scene, East V, 31<U+2013>35, London.]]

The pediments, metopes and shield of the [[Athena Parthenos|Parthenos]] all illustrate the mythological past and as the gods are observing on the east frieze it is natural to reach for a mythological explanation. Chrysoula Kardara,<ref>Kadara, 1964, pp.62<U+2013>158,, see also Brommer, 1977, p.149.</ref> has ventured that the relief shows us the first Panathenaic procession instituted under the mythical King [[Kekrops]]. This explanation would account for the absence of the allies and the ship as these post-date the original practice of the sacrificial rite.

Thus, the gods turn their backs to her to prevent the pollution from the sight of her death. A contentious subject in the field, Connelly's solution to the problem of meaning poses as many problems as it answers.<ref>"Revolutionary" in the words of Sarah Peirce in the report on the symposium on "Parthenon and Panathenaia." at Princeton University, September 18, 1993.

The earliest surviving works of art that exhibit traces of the influence of the Parthenon frieze belong to the media of [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vase painting]] and [[stele|grave stelae]] where we can find some echo not just of motifs, themes, poses but tenor, as well. Direct imitation, and indeed quotation, of the frieze begins to be pronounced around 430 BC. One example, an explicit copy, is a [[pelike]] attributed to the Wedding Painter of a youth <U+201C>parking up<U+201D> a horse exactly in the manner of the figure W25 on the frieze.<ref>Berlin F 2357</ref> While those vase paintings that resemble the frieze cluster around 430, the vases that quote the pediments are datable nearer to the end of the century, giving further evidence of the priority of the sculptural program.<ref>Niels, 2001, p.204</ref> More accomplished painters also found inspiration in the sculpture, namely [[Polygnotos (vase painter)|Polygnotos I]] and his group, especially the Peleus Painter, the [[Kleophon Painter]] and the late work of the [[Achilles Painter]]. Later painters of talent also managed to capture the mood of ''eusebeia'' or thoughtful piety of the procession as, for example, on the volute krater of the [[Kleophon Painter]] of a sacrifice to Apollo,<ref>Ferrara T57</ref> which shares the quiet dignity of the best of High Classical sculpture.<ref>Robertson, 1992, p.223, "One of the artist's masterpieces<U+2026>[i]n the pictures on this vase the Kleophon Painter is still Periklean in the happiest sense".</ref>

The impact of the frieze can be sought in the Attic relief sculpture of the late 5th century; this resonance may be discovered to some degree in the public works of the Hephaisteion frieze and the Nike Athena balustrade, where the imagery of the seated gods and the sandal-binder respectively likely owes a debt to the Parthenon. There are also traces found on the private commissions of grave stelae from the period, for example the <U+201C>cat stele<U+201D> from Aegina bears a distinct similarity to the figures N135<U+2013>6.<ref>NAMA 715</ref> As does the Hermes of the four-figure relief known from a Roman copy.<ref>Louvre MA 854</ref> Later classicizing art of the Hellenistic and Roman eras also looked to the frieze for inspiration as attested by the Lycian Sarcophagus of Sidon, Phoenicia, the [[Ara Pacis Augustae]], the [[Gemma Augustea]], and many pieces of the [[Hadrian]]ic generation.<ref>For example the marble relief from Hadrian's villa BM 2206</ref>
