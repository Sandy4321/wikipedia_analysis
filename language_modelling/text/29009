[[Image:Francis-Marion-Crawford.png|thumb|right|Francis Crawford]]'''Francis Marion Crawford''' ([[August 2]], [[1854]] - [[April 9]], [[1909]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[writer]] noted for his many [[novel]]s.

He was born at [[Bagni di Lucca]], [[Italy]], the son of the American sculptor [[Thomas Crawford]] and Louisa Cutler Ward, and the nephew of [[Julia Ward Howe]], the American poet. He studied successively at [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St Paul's School]], [[Concord, New Hampshire]]; [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]; [[University of Heidelberg]]; and Rome.

In [[1879]] he went to [[India]], where he studied [[Sanskrit]] and edited the ''Allahabad Indian Herald.'' Returning to America he continued to study Sanskrit at [[Harvard University]] for a year, contributed to various periodicals, and in 1882 produced his first novel, ''Mr Isaacs,'' a brilliant sketch of modern Anglo-Indian life mingled with a touch of Oriental mystery. This book had an immediate success, and its author's promise was confirmed by the publication of ''Dr Claudius'' (1883). After a brief residence in [[New York]] and [[Boston]], in 1883 he returned to Italy, where he made his permanent home. This accounts perhaps for the fact that, in spite of his nationality, Marion Crawford's books stand apart from any distinctively American current in literature.

Year by year Crawford published a number of successful novels. He also published the historical works, ''Ave Roma Immortalis'' (1898), ''Rulers of the South'' (1900) renamed ''Sicily, Calabria and Malta'' in 1904, and ''Gleanings from Venetian History'' (1905). In these his intimate knowledge of local [[Italy|Italian]] history combines with the romanticist's imaginative faculty to excellent effect.

After most of his fictional works had been published, most came to think he was a gifted narrator, and his books of fiction, full of historic vitality and dramatic characterization, became widely popular among readers to whom the realism of problems or the eccentricities of subjective analysis were repellent. In ''The Novel: What It Is'' (1893), he defended his literary approach, self-conceived as a combination of romanticism and realism, defining the art form in terms of its marketplace and audience. The novel, he wrote, is "a marketable commodity" and "intellectual artistic luxury" (8, 9) that "must amuse, indeed, but should amuse reasonably, from an intellectual point of view. . . . Its intention is to amuse and please, and certainly not to teach and preach; but in order to amuse well it must be a finely-balanced creation. . . ." (82).

The [[Saracinesca]] series is perhaps known to be his best work, with the third in the series, ''Don Orsino,'' set against the background of a real estate bubble, told with effective concision. A fourth book in the series, ''Corleone'', was the first major treatment of the [[Mafia]] in literature, and used the now-familiar but then-original device of a priest unable to testify to a crime because of the Seal of the Confessional; the novel nevertheless failed to live up to the standard set by the books earlier in the series. 

Crawford himself was fondest of ''[[Khaled: A Tale of Arabia]]'', a story of a [[genie]] (''genius'' is Crawford's word) who becomes human, which was reprinted in the [[Ballantine Adult Fantasy series]] of the early [[1970]]s. ''A Cigarette-maker's Romance'' was dramatized, and had considerable popularity on the stage as well as in its novel form; and in ''1902'' an original play from his pen, ''Francesca da Rimini,'' was produced in [[Paris]] by [[Sarah Bernhardt]]. Several of his short stories, such as "The Upper Berth" (1886), "For the Blood Is the Life" (1911, a vampire tale) and "The Screaming Skull" (1908), are often-anthologized classics of the horror genre. An essay on Crawford's weird tales can be found in [[S. T. Joshi]]'s ''The Evolution of the Weird Tale'' (2004).

Three distinct editions of his collected works -- each printing only his fiction -- appeared during his lifetime. Crawford died at [[Sorrento]] in 1909 of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].
