==Background and composition==
Eminem and Rihanna recorded an alternate version to "Love the Way You Lie" in 2010, but with Rihanna as the lead vocalist, and views aspects of a relationship from a female perspective, unlike [[Love the Way You Lie]], which views aspects from a male perspective.<ref>{{cite web|last=Muhammad|first=Latifah|url=http://www.theboombox.com/2010/10/19/rihanna-eminem-love-the-way-you-lie-sequel|title=Rihanna and Eminem to make a Love the Way You Lie sequel|work=The Boom Box|work=[[AOL Inc.]]|date=2010-10-19|accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref> Rihanna said in an interview with [[MTV.com]] that initially she was "very against" recording a sequel, stating "When I first heard the idea about doing a part two, I was just completely against it. I just felt like you couldn't beat the original. There's no way you can out do that, so why compete with it?". She continued to discuss how when she first heard the "broken down" version of the song in the studio with Eminem, all of her reservations about recording it went away, saying "We heard a broken-down version that was stripped down, just piano...I fell in love with it. We recorded it, then we did another version to the stripped-down version with drums, then we did another version with drums and Eminem".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/music/2010/10/30/15890306-wenn-photo.html|title=Rihanna worried about Eminem duet sequel|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|publisher=Mention|date=2010-10-30|accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref> 

The piano and drums version, which features Eminem, appears as the final song on the standard edition of ''Loud'', whilst the piano version, which excludes Eminem's part in the song, appears as a bonus track on the [[iTunes]] edition of ''Loud''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|title=Rihanna Initially Against 'Love The Way You Lie (Part II)' With Eminem|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1651117/20101029/eminem.jhtml|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|date=2010-10-29|accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref> "Love The Way You Lie (Part II)" is a mid-tempo song,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdVPE.asp?ppn=MN0088991|title=Digital Sheet Music, Rihanna "S&M"|year=2010|publisher=[[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]]}}</ref> which incorporates the musical genres of [[Hip hop]] and [[R&B]]. According to sheet music published at Musicnotes, the song is written in [[Time signature|common time]] with a moderate tempo of 89 [[Tempo|beats per minute]]. The song is written in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[G minor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdVPE.asp?ppn=MN0088991|title=Digital Sheet Music, Rihanna "S&M"|year=2010|publisher=[[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]]}}</ref> Emily Mackay of ''[[NME]]'' commented about the vocals provided by Rihanna and Eminem in the song, stating that "There<U+2019>s great contrast in Part II of <U+2018>Love The Way You Lie<U+2019>. With the balance of vocals neatly flipped and extra cavernous beats ramping up the drama, it wallows ever-deeper in the tortured relationship sketched out in Part I. Eminem at points is practically screaming with rage, and sounding, frankly, mental. The contrast with Rihanna<U+2019>s smoothly pitched pain (<U+201C>Maybe I<U+2019>m a masochist/Try to run but I don<U+2019>t wanna never leave<U+201D>) is delicious."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/rihanna/11718|title=Album Review: Rihanna - Loud |work=[[NME]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=2010-11-12|accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
[[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that <U+201C>''Loud'' works the pop gizmos as neatly as any album this year, maintaining the Rihanna brand. But the album has a hermetic, cool calculation until it gets to 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II),' her take on the tortured hit she shared with Eminem. 'It<U+2019>s sick that all these battles are what keeps me satisfied,' she sings. A lone piano humanizes her first vocals, and she rides the ascending power ballad to a pained resolve; then Eminem delivers new verses in a spiraling rage. It<U+2019>s purely theatrical, but it<U+2019>s also, for a moment, raw.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pareles|first=John|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/arts/music/16choice.html|title=Critics Choice - New CDs|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]]|date=2010-11-15|accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref> Chris Richards of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said that "With 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II),' the maniac-mouthed rapper is limited to just one verse, giving Rihanna the space to take ownership of the proceedings. Will the real Rihanna please stand up? She does -- and she sounds as remote as ever."<ref>{{cite news|last=Richards|first=Chris|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/15/AR2010111506697.html|title=Rihanna's new albums: 'Loud,' yes, but what's clear?|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Katharine Weymouth]]|date=2010-11-16|accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref> James Skinner of ''[[BBC Online]]'' viewed 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II)' as being even better than the original. He said, "Eminem<U+2019>s verse exuding the kind of volatile, simmering menace that got everyone so excited about him in the first place. But it is Rihanna<U+2019>s vocal <U+2013> at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable <U+2013> that anchors the song, and Loud itself, elevating it from a hit-and-miss collection into something oddly arresting."<ref>{{cite news|last=Skinner|first=James|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/x5fd |title=Music <U+2013> Review of Rihanna <U+2013> Loud|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2010-11-15|accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref>

Steve Jones of ''[[USA Today]]'' gave a mixed review of the collaboration,  commenting, "Eminem puts in a cameo on 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II)', which extends, but doesn't really add, to their earlier hit about a tortured relationship from his Recovery album."<ref>{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Steve|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/reviews/2010-11-16-listen16_ST_N.htm|title=Listen Up: Rihanna is living out 'Loud' on new album|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=2010-11-16|accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref> ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' writer Thomas Conner gave a negative review of the song, stating, "She collaborated with [[Eminem]] this summer on the controversial '"[[Love the Way You Lie]]"', a song and hotly debated video conflating wild passion with crazed assault. She returns to this on "[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]" with "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)", an extension of the melody and the arson metaphor, in which Eminem reappears with more histrionic rapping about hating her, loving her, hitting her and hugging her. It's an unnecessary sequel that further muddies the issue: Is this a social statement, or merely an artistic expression about some truly troubled and confused people."<ref>{{cite news|last=Conner|first=Thomas|url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/2896510,conner-rhianna-loud-review-111610.article|title='Loud' a well-deserved party for Rihanna|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=John Barron|date=2010-11-12|accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref>
