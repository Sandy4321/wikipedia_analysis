'''''Orr v. Orr''''', 440 U.S. 268 (1979), was a case decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] that held that a statutory scheme in [[Alabama]] that imposed [[alimony]] obligations on husbands but not on wives was an [[unconstitutional]] [[equal protection]] violation.<ref>Varat, J.D. et al.  ''Constitutional Law Cases and Materials, Concise Thirteenth Edition.''  Foundation Press, NY: 2009, p. 580</ref>

==Decision==
The state of Alabama had adopted a statutory scheme that imposed alimony obligations on husbands but not on wives for the stated purpose of addressing the economic disparity between men and women by providing support for needy women after divorce.<ref>Varat, p. 580</ref>.  Applying [[intermediate scrutiny]], the court determined that the statute was not substantially related to the stated purpose.  The court observed that a gender neutral statute would still have the effect of providing for needy women, and that the only difference created by the Alabama statute was to also provide support for well off women that did not need support and to exclude needy men from support.<ref>Varat, p. 581</ref>
