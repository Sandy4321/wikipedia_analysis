'''Anton (Ton) Alberts''' ([[July 6]] [[1927]] - [[August 16]] [[1999]], [[Amsterdam]])  was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] architect best known for the [[ING Bank]] ([[1982]]) in the [[Bijlmer]] district of Amsterdam and the Gas Corporation headquarters in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]. 

Alberts was involved with [[Situationist International]] before being expelled in [[1960]].  He had been involved with fellow Situationists [[Constant]] and [[Har Oudejans]] in setting up a labyrinth in the [[Stedelijk Museum]] of [[Amsterdam]], but the project fell apart amidst acrimony. Officially he was expelled for designing churches, although [[Asger Jorn]] relates the expulsion more to the "Amsterdam affair".

In [[1963]] he founded the firm Alberts and Van Huut with [[Max van Huut]], guided by the principles of [[Organic architecture]]. His work also has its roots in the [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] architecture of [[Rudolf Steiner]].<ref>Pearson, David, ''New Organic Architecture'', Univ. of California Press: 2001.</ref>

Alberts offered to work for free on the Peace Parks in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] but was only able to create sketches before his death. Still, by Albert's sketches the [[Peace Flame House]], a community centre, was built in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a gift by [[Peace Flame Foundation Netherlands]] to this after-war community.
