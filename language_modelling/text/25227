'''Ram<U+00F3>n Blanco y Erenas, marqu<U+00E9>s de Pe<U+00F1>a Plata''' ([[1833]]<U+2014>[[1906]]) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[brigadier]] and [[Spanish Empire|colonial]] administrator.  Born in [[San Sebasti<U+00E1>n]], he was sent to the [[Caribbean]] for the first time in [[1858]]; he was stationed at [[Cuba]] and at [[Dominican Republic|Santo Domingo]].  In [[1861]], he returned to Spain but was then sent to the [[Philippines]] (1866-1871).<ref>[http://www.xtec.es/~jrovira6/bio/blanco.htm (1833-1906):BIOGRAFIA DEL GENERAL RAMON BLANCO Y ERENAS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Afterwards, he returned to Spain and served in the [[Third Carlist War]], where he attained the rank of brigadier.  He served as captain-general of [[Navarre]] after taking part in the 1876 offensive in the valley of [[Baztan]]; he acquired his [[marquisate]] during this time.<ref>[http://www.xtec.es/~jrovira6/bio/blanco.htm (1833-1906):BIOGRAFIA DEL GENERAL RAMON BLANCO Y ERENAS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  He was sent to Cuba as captain-general in April 1879, and was involved in the [[Little War (Cuba)|Little War]].  He returned to Spain in November 1881 and served as captain-general of [[Catalonia]] and [[Extremadura]].<ref>[http://www.xtec.es/~jrovira6/bio/blanco.htm (1833-1906):BIOGRAFIA DEL GENERAL RAMON BLANCO Y ERENAS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Governor of the Philippines (1893<U+2014>December 13, 1896)==
{{Main|Philippine Revolution}}
In 1893, [[Antonio C<U+00E1>novas del Castillo]] sent him to the Philippines, where Blanco remained until December 13, 1896.  Blanco was forced to deal with the independence movement led by [[Katipunan]].  On the whole, Blanco adopted a conciliatory stance, seeking to improve Spain<U+2019>s image in the face of world opinion.<ref>[http://www.ucm.es/info/especulo/numero37/maeztu.html Cristobal Cerrato: El joven Maeztu y la canalla period<U+00ED>stica- n<U+00BA> 37 Esp<U+00E9>culo (UCM)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Nevertheless, he placed eight provinces under martial law. These were [[Manila]], [[Bulacan]], [[Cavite]], [[Pampanga]], [[Tarlac]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Batangas]], and [[Nueva Ecija]]. They would later be represented in the eight rays of the sun in the [[Flag of the Philippines|Filipino flag]]. Arrests and interrogations were intensified and many Filipinos died from torture.  

When the revolution broke out, [[Jos<U+00E9> Rizal]] was living as a political exile in Dapitan and had just volunteered to serve as a doctor in Cuba, where a [[History of Cuba#Independence from Spain|similar revolution]] was taking place.  Blanco permitted Rizal, who wished to dissociate himself from the Philippine Revolution, to serve in Cuba to minister to victims of [[yellow fever]].  Rizal nevertheless was arrested en route.  Blanco could do nothing about it, for he had been forced out of office on December 13.  The governor had been attacked by conservative forces (which included the so-called ''frailocracia'',<ref>As the word ''frailocracia'' cannot be found in most Spanish dictionaries nor the word <U+201C>frailocracy<U+201D> in the English, the term must have been coined by succeeding Filipino writers to refer to this 'unique' system of government</ref> --the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars exercising more power than the civilian government) for being too conciliatory towards the [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] who sought independence; these parties had sent a complaint to [[Madrid]].<ref>[http://www.xtec.es/~jrovira6/bio/blanco.htm (1833-1906):BIOGRAFIA DEL GENERAL RAMON BLANCO Y ERENAS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Blanco was replaced by [[Camilo Polavieja]] (r. 1896-1897) as governor. 

Rizal was executed on December 30, an act to which Blanco objected.<ref>[http://www.ucm.es/info/especulo/numero37/maeztu.html Cristobal Cerrato: El joven Maeztu y la canalla period<U+00ED>stica- n<U+00BA> 37 Esp<U+00E9>culo (UCM)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Blanco later was to present his sash and sword to the Rizal family as an apology.

Blanco had been defended by liberals such as [[Ramiro de Maeztu]], who in an article dated July 24, 1898, declared: "But...Blanco, who in the Philippines, in the face of the opinion of the Junta of Authorities and the most illustrious and noble journalists, kept his troops in the capital for a long time, judging it more preferable to prudently remain in this position rather than die a glorious but pointless death...<U+201D><ref>[http://www.ucm.es/info/especulo/numero37/maeztu.html Cristobal Cerrato: El joven Maeztu y la canalla period<U+00ED>stica- n<U+00BA> 37 Esp<U+00E9>culo (UCM)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Captain-General of Cuba==
However, Blanco<U+2019>s reputation as a conciliatory figure led the government of [[Pr<U+00E1>xedes Mateo Sagasta]] to send him to Cuba, where he replaced the decidedly inflammatory [[Valeriano Weyler]] as Captain General of Cuba.<ref>[http://www.xtec.es/~jrovira6/bio/blanco.htm (1833-1906):BIOGRAFIA DEL GENERAL RAMON BLANCO Y ERENAS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  By the end of 1897, Weyler had relocated more than 300,000 Cubans into "reconcentration camps," where he failed to provide for them adequately. Consequently, these areas became cesspools of hunger and disease, where many hundreds of thousands died. 

Blanco was forced to reverse the harsh policy of Weyler towards the Cubans while at the same time defending the island after the outbreak of the [[Spanish-American War]].<ref>[http://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/blanco.html Ram<U+00F3>n Blanco y Erenas<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  After the sinking of the ''[[USS Maine (ACR-1)|Maine]]'' on February 15, 1898, [[Charles Dwight Sigsbee]] had written that "many Spanish officers, including representatives of General Blanco, now with us to express sympathy."<ref>G.J.A. O<U+2019>Toole, ''The Spanish War: An American Epic 1898'' (New York: W.W. Norton, 1984), 11.</ref>  In a cable, the Spanish Minister of Colonies, [[Segismundo Moret]], had advised Blanco <U+201C>to gather every fact you can to prove the Maine catastrophe cannot be attributed to us.<U+201D><ref>O<U+2019>Toole, ''The Spanish War'', 125.</ref> Blanco proposed a joint Spanish-American investigation of the sinking.<ref> O<U+2019>Toole, ''The Spanish War'', 128.</ref>     

On March 5, 1898, Blanco proposed to [[M<U+00E1>ximo G<U+00F3>mez]] that the Cuban generalissimo and troops join him and the Spanish army in repelling the [[United States]] in the face of the Spanish-American War.  Blanco appealed to the shared heritage of the Cubans and Spanish, and promised the island autonomy if the Cubans would help fight the Americans.  Blanco had declared: "As Spaniards and Cubans we find ourselves opposed to foreigners of a different race, who are of a grasping nature... The supreme moment has come in which we should forget past differences and, with Spaniards and Cubans united for the sake of their own defense, repel the invader.  Spain will not forget the noble help of its Cuban sons, and once the foreign enemy is expelled from the island, she will, like an affectionate mother, embrace in her arms a new daughter amongst the nations of the New World, who speaks the same language, practices the same faith, and feels the same noble Spanish blood run through her veins."<ref>[http://www.autentico.org/oa09126.php Proposicion del Capitan General Ramon Blanco Erenas<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  G<U+00F3>mez refused to adhere to Blanco's plan.<ref>[http://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/blanco.html Ram<U+00F3>n Blanco y Erenas<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  

Blanco believed it better to fight than surrender to the [[United States|Americans]].  He ordered [[Pascual Cervera y Topete]] to break the American blockade, leading to the [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]].<ref>[http://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/blanco.html Ram<U+00F3>n Blanco y Erenas<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.smplanet.com/imperialism/splendid.html A Splendid Little War<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

During Blanco's governorship, the remains of [[Christoper Columbus]] were moved back to the [[Cathedral of Seville]] in Spain,<ref>[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/12368307610158273876213/p0000001.htm Crist<U+00F3>bal Col<U+00F3>n : traslaci<U+00F3>n de sus restos mortales a la ciudad de Sevilla - Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> where they were placed on an elaborate [[catafalque]].  

Blanco returned to Spain after the end of the Spanish-American War.
