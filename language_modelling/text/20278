On [[February 17]], the song entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number one solely on download sales and remained at the top of the charts for five weeks. The retro-soul style is given further significance by the appearance of several [[Northern Soul]] dancers in the song's video. As of 25 July 2008, Mercy has been viewed on [[YouTube]] over 25 million times.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE2orthS3TQ]</ref> Mercy is included in the [[FIFA 09]] soundtrack.<ref>[http://www.fifa09.ea.com/us/readnews/entryid/25050]</ref> 

Mercy was the best selling single of 2008 in the UK with over 420,000 sales until the end of the year when it was overtaken by [[Hero]] by the [[List of The X Factor finalists (UK series 5)|X Factor Finalists]] and [[Hallelujah]] by X Factor winner [[Alexandra Burke]]. Mercy was the third best selling single of 2008 in the UK with over 500,000 sales.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_7800000/newsid_7803400/7803437.stm</ref> Elsewhere, it managed to chart within many countries top ten end of year bestseller lists.

== Song information ==
According to Duffy, the song is autobiographical and is about "sexual liberty" and "not doing something somebody else wants you to do".<ref>[http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2008/03/26/new-video-duffy-mercy/ MTV Buzzworthy blog]</ref> In an interview the singer also likened singing Mercy to having sex and said she loved to sing it as she felt it was like "having sex everyday".<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wnS5YM3of4</ref>  

The introduction of the song is somewhat reminiscent of the opening bars of '[[Stand by Me (song)|Stand by Me]]' by Ben E King, although the intro to 'Stand By Me' uses 1 5 and major 7, while the intro to 'Mercy' uses 1 5 and b7, making it sound more "bluesey".  'Mercy' is written in the key of G major and the chord progression used is the 12 bar blues so the main chords are I,IV,V.

"Mercy" won the [[2008 MOJO Awards|2008]] [[MOJO Awards|MOJO Award]] for Song of the Year. The award is voted by readers of the magazine. The magazines editor Phil Alexander called the song a "timeless" classic that " could really have come from any period in time over the last 50 years".<ref name="telegraph.co.uk">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/2139775/Duffy-wins-big-with-Mercy-at-Mojo-Awards.html Duffy wins big with Mercy at Mojo Awards The Telegraph 16 June, 2008]</ref> The song was used as Duffy's debut single internationally.
