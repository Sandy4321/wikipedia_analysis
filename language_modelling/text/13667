'''New England School of Law'''  ('''NESL''' or '''New England Law''' or '''New England Law | Boston''') is a private [[law school]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. It was founded in 1908 as a law school for  women.

==History==
[[Image:NESLBoston.JPG|thumb|left|225px|Main academic building on Stuart Street]]
In 1908, two women from Boston decided to sit for the [[Massachusetts]] [[bar examination]]. A lawyer named Arthur Winfield MacLean agreed to tutor them, and other students followed over the next few years. MacLean's wife called the school Portia Law School after the heroine of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''. From 1908 to 1938, Portia Law School was the sister school to the then all male, [[Suffolk University Law School]]. This partnership fostered because MacLean was a law partner with Suffolk founder, [[Gleason Archer, Sr.]] MacLean also served as the school's first Dean from 1908-1943.<ref>Michael Rustad, "Book Reviews," ''Contemporary Sociology'', January 1986, Vol. 15, Number 1, page 102. accessed through [[JSTOR]]</ref> 

Beginning in 1920, Portia graduates received the [[LL.B.]] degree.<ref name="NESL History 1908-1942">{{cite web|url=http://www.nesl.edu/HistoryProject/1908/|title=NESL History 1908|accessdate=2009-06-07}}</ref> In 1922, the school moved into its first permanent building in Boston's [[Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Beacon Hill]] neighborhood, when enrollment had reached 228.<ref name="NESL History 1908-1942"/> In 1926, Portia was awarded the authority to award [[LL.M.]] degrees to both men and women.<ref name="NESL History 1908-1942"/> A few years later, in 1938, Portia Law School became a fully integrated [[coeducational]] institution. As the school entered the 1950s it saw its student body shift from a student body that had a majority female population to a predominately male student body.<ref name="NESL History 1943-1968">{{cite web|url=http://www.nesl.edu/HistoryProject/1943/|title=NESL History 1943|accessdate=2009-06-07}}</ref> 1963 saw Portia Law School begin the process of applying for [[American Bar Association]] accreditation,<ref name="NESL History 1943-1968"/> and some of the steps the school took included restructuring its [[board of governors]] and launching the schools first [[law review]].<ref name="NESL History 1943-1968"/> In 1969, the school changed its name to New England School of Law to coincide with its accreditation granted by the ABA.<ref>http://www.abanet.org/legaled/approvedlawschools/alpha.html</ref>
