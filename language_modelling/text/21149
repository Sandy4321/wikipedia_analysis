The '''Elizabeth Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane''',<ref name="Serious">{{Cite comic |writer=Morrison, Grant |artist=McKean, Dave |letterer= Saladino, Gaspar |title=[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth]] |date=October 1989 |publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> commonly called '''Arkham Asylum''', is a [[fictional]] [[psychiatric hospital]] in the [[DC Comics Universe|DC Universe]], usually appearing in stories featuring [[Batman]]. Many [[Psychosis|psychotic]] criminals from across the DC Universe, mostly from [[List of Batman Family enemies|Batman's own rogues gallery]] (such as the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], the [[Riddler (comics)|Riddler]], [[Two-Face]], the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], [[Killer Croc]], and [[Harley Quinn]]) have been imprisoned within the Asylum and also escaped from it. The Arkham Asylum is named after the Sanatorium in the fictional city of [[Arkham|Arkham, Massachusetts]], found in many of [[H.P. Lovecraft]]'s short horror and science fiction stories, such as "[[The Colour Out of Space|The Colour out of Space]]".

==History==
Arkham Asylum is located on the outskirts of [[Gotham City]] and is where those of Batman's foes considered to be [[insanity|legally insane]] are incarcerated (other foes are incarcerated at [[Blackgate Penitentiary]]). Although it has had numerous administrators, recent comic books have featured [[Jeremiah Arkham]]. Inspired by the works of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and in particular his fictional city of [[Arkham|Arkham, Massachusetts]],<ref name="Unauthorised">{{cite book |title=Batman Unauthorized: Vigilantes, Jokers, and Heroes in Gotham City |first=Dennis |last=O'Neil |publisher=BenBella Books |year=2008 |page= 111 |isbn=1-933771-30-5}}</ref><ref name="Dark Age">{{cite book |title=The Dark Age: Grim, Great & Gimmicky Post-Modern Comics first1=Mark |last1=Voger |first2=Kathy |last2=Voglesong |page=5 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |year=2006 |isbn=1-893905-53-5}}</ref> the asylum was created by [[Dennis O'Neil]] and first appeared in ''Batman'' #258 (October 1974); much of its [[back-story]] was created by [[Len Wein]] during the 1980s.

Arkham Asylum does not have a good record, at least with regard to the high profile cases<U+2014>inmates, such as the Joker, are frequently shown escaping at will<U+2014>and those who are "cured" and released tend to re-offend. Furthermore, several staff members, including its founder, Dr. [[Amadeus Arkham]], and director Dr. [[Jeremiah Arkham]], as well as staff members [[Harley Quinn|Dr. Harleen Quinzel]], [[Lock-Up (comics)|Lyle Bolton]] and, in some incarnations, Drs. [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Jonathan Crane]] and [[Hugo Strange]], have gone insane, too.

In addition, prisoners with unusual medical conditions that prevent them from staying in a regular prison are housed in Arkham. For example, [[Mr. Freeze]] is not always depicted as insane, but he requires a strongly refrigerated environment to stay alive; Arkham, with special conditions required for certain patients or inmates being a regularity rather than exception, is seen by authorities to be an ideal location under certain circumstances.

Gotham criminals deemed "criminally insane" or "mentally unfit" by the court of law generally are treated at Williams Medical Center before being deemed dangerous enough to be sent to Arkham Asylum.<ref name=Laugh>{{Cite comic | writer= [[Ed Brubaker|Brubaker, Ed]] |artist=[[Doug Mahnke|Mahnke, Doug]] |colorist=[[David Baron (comics)|Baron, David]] | letterer=Leigh, Rob |title=[[Batman: The Man Who Laughs]]| date=February 2005 | publisher=DC Comics}}</ref>

==Origins==
Just outside [[Gotham City]], Arkham Asylum has a long and brutal history, beginning when its own architect went mad and hacked his workers to death with an axe. He was convicted and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in the same asylum he had been building.<ref name=Laugh /> The one-shot graphic novel ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth]]'' establishes that the asylum was named after Elizabeth Arkham, the mother of founder [[Amadeus Arkham]]. The original name of the asylum was "Arkham Hospital". Its dark history began in the early 1900s when Arkham's mother, having suffered from [[mental illness]] most of her life, committed [[suicide]]. However, it was later revealed that her son had actually [[euthanasia|euthanized]] her, and repressed the memory. Amadeus then decided, as the sole heir to the Arkham estate, to remodel his family home in order to properly treat the mentally ill, so others might not suffer the fate as his mother. Prior to the period of the hospital's remodeling, Amadeus Arkham treated patients at the State Psychiatric Hospital in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], where he, his wife Constance, and his daughter Harriet, had been living for quite some time. Upon telling his family of his plans, they moved back to his family home to oversee the remodeling. While there, Amadeus Arkham received a call from the police notifying him that [[Mad_Dog_(DC_Comics)#Martin_.22Mad_Dog.22_Hawkins|Martin "Mad Dog" Hawkins]], a [[serial killer]], referred to Amadeus Arkham by Metropolis Penitentiary while at State Psychiatric Hospital, had escaped from prison, and sought his considered opinion on the murderer's state of mind. Shortly afterward, Amadeus Arkham returned to his home to find his front door wide open. Inside, he discovered the corpses of his wife and daughter in an upstairs room, with Mad Dog's alias carved on Harriet's body. Despite this family tragedy, the Elizabeth Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane officially opened that November. With his sanity in tatters, Dr. Arkham designed a floor plan that evoked [[occult]] runes, he believed that the pattern would drive away the mysterious bat that haunted his dreams.<ref>''Batman The World of the Dark Knight''</ref> One of its first patients was Mad Dog, whom Amadeus Arkham insisted on treating personally. After treating Mad Dog for six months, Amadeus Arkham strapped him to an [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock]] couch then deliberately and purposefully [[electric shock|electrocuted]] him. The staff treated the death as an accident, but it contributed to Amadeus Arkham's gradual descent into the madness which he began to believe was his birthright. Eventually, Amadeus Arkham was incarcerated in his own asylum, where he died.<ref name="Serious"/>

==Publication history==
Arkham Asylum first appeared in October 1974, in ''Batman'' #258 by [[Dennis O'Neil]]. In this story, it is named as "Arkham Hospital", although it is not clear what kind of hospital it is. "Arkham Asylum" first appeared in another O'Neil story the following year, but it was not until 1979 that "Arkham Asylum" completely replaced "Arkham Hospital", and the occasional "Arkham Sanitarium", as the institution's name. Also in 1979, the move to have the asylum closer to Gotham had begun; that was completed in 1980, when ''Batman'' #326 by [[Len Wein]] described the asylum's location "deep in the [[suburb]]s of Gotham City". It is perhaps for this reason that ''Batman'' #326 is listed in some histories as the first appearance of Arkham Asylum. It was also Wein who, in 1985's ''Who's Who'' #1, created its current backstory.

Arkham Asylum has been demolished or destroyed several times in its history, notably during the events of ''Batman: The Last Arkham'' (see below). It is also seriously damaged at the beginning of the ''[[Knightfall]]'' storyline, when [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] uses stolen munitions to blow up the facility and release all the inmates. After these events, the asylum is relocated to a large mansion known as "Mercey Mansion". It was also blown up by [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] during the ''[[Battle for the Cowl]]'' story arc.<ref name="Cowl1">{{Cite comic |writer=Daniel, Tony S |penciller=Daniel, Tony S |inker=Florea, Sandu |colorist=Hannin, Ian |letterer= Fletcher, Jared K |title=Batman: Battle for the Cowl |story=A Hostile Takeover |issue=1 |date=May 2009 |publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> At the beginning of the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' storyline, the asylum is closed down and all its inmates set free. In this instance, a timer was used to open the doors two minutes before the city is sealed. This is orchestrated by the administrator himself, who had the choice of releasing the inmates or watching them all starve or kill each other. In the middle of the story, it is revealed that Batman has established a hidden base within the sub-basement of the asylum during the ''Prodigal'' storyline known as "Northwest [[Batcave]]."<ref name="NMLSFO">{{Cite comic |writer=Kwitney, Alissa |penciller=Zulli, Michael |inker=Locke, Vince |colorist=Giddings, Noelle |letterer= Schubert, Willie |title=Batman: No Man's Land Secret Files and Origins |story=Batcaves |issue=1 |date=December 1999 |publisher=DC Comics}}</ref>

In the ''Battle for the Cowl'' one-shot, Dr. Arkham wanders among the remains of the asylum as he muses on his life. He reveals that he has discovered blueprints created by his ancestor, the first Dr. Arkham, for a new Arkham Asylum. He also contemplates the fates of his own nonviolent, "special" patients: an artist with almost no facial features who must paint facial expressions onto his almost blank face to express himself; a man obsessed with his own reflection in a series of mirrors in his room; and a woman supposedly so ugly, one glance at her face would drive anyone insane. Upon discovering his "special" patients (unharmed from the destruction thanks to their secluded cells), Arkham resolves to rebuild the facility according to his ancestor's vision, but to serve as a literal asylum for mentally ill patients in order to shelter them from the outside world. However, when told to be happy with the new development, the artist secretly paints his face white with a hideous grin, reminiscent of [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]]; it is implied that the "special" inmates, as well as Arkham himself, have given in to madness.

In the ''Arkham Reborn'' mini-series, Arkham Asylum is rebuilt and financed by Dr. Arkham.<ref name="Reborn">{{Cite comic |writer=Hine, David |artist=Haun, Jeremy |colorist=Kalisz, John |letterer=Cipriano, Sal |title=Arkham Reborn |issue=1<U+2013>3 |date=October<U+2013>December 2009 |publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> But in ''Batman'' #697, Dr. Arkham is revealed to be the new Black Mask and is imprisoned in his own asylum. It was also revealed during ''Arkham Reborn,'' that as both Dr. Arkham and Black Mask, he had begun to manipulate patients, a plotline that culminated in ''Detective Comics'' with Alyce Sinner becoming the new head of the facility, but secretly working with Arkham/Black Mask. It was also revealed that the "special" patients were figments of Arkham's imagination.

==Staff==
* '''[[Amadeus Arkham|Dr. Amadeus Arkham]]''' <br> The founder of the asylum, Amadeus named the institution after his deceased mother Elizabeth.<ref name="Serious"/>

* '''[[Jeremiah Arkham|Dr. Jeremiah Arkham]]''' <br> The nephew of Amadeus Arkham, Jeremiah was the head of the asylum in current continuity until recently, in which he too was driven insane and became the second Black Mask.

* '''[[Corrections officer|CO]] Aaron Cash''' <br> One of Arkham's most respected security guards. His hand was bitten off by Killer Croc,<ref name="Hell4">{{cite comic |writer=Slott, Dan |penciller=Sook, Ryan |inker=Von Grawbadger, Wade |colorist=Loughridge, Lee |letterer=Heisler, Michael |title=Arkham Asylum: Living Hell |volume=1 |issue=4 |story=Tic Toc |date=October 2003 |publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> and he sports a prosthetic hook in its place. Unlike many of his colleagues, Cash is neither insane nor corrupt, and is a trusted ally of Batman.<ref name="BAAgame"/> In the games, he is voiced by [[Duane R. Shepard Sr.]].

* '''Dr. Joan Leland''' <br> Once a colleague of Harleen Quinzel, Dr. Leeland soon became her therapist, along with treating other known inmates such as Jonathan Crane (Scarecrow) and Harvey Dent (Two-Face).

* '''Dr. Alyce Sinner''' <br> Chosen by Jeremiah Arkham as his second in command, and briefly committed under Arkham's orders, Sinner became head of the asylum after Arkham was revealed as Black Mask. She is secretly a member of [[Intergang]]'s Church of Crime, working with Black Mask. She has shoulder length brown hair wrapped in red ribbons with sins written on the inside.

* '''[[Harley Quinn|Dr. Harleen Quinzel]]''' <br> A former psychiatric intern, Quinzel was seduced by the Joker and adopted the supervillain name "Harley Quinn".<ref name="Mad Love">{{cite comic |writer=Dini, Paul |penciller=Timm, Bruce; Murakami, Glen |inker=Timm, Bruce |colorist=Timm, Bruce; Taylor, Rick |letterer=Harkins, Tim |title=Batman Adventures: Mad Love |date=February 1994 |publisher=DC Comics}}</ref>

=== Staff in ''Batman: Arkham Asylum (Video Game)'' ===
* '''Quincy Sharp''' <br> Unlike traditional administrators, Sharp styles himself a titled [[:wikt:warden|warden]] of Arkham Asylum in the video game ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'' and does not seem genuinely interested in psychiatric treatment. His standoffish and old-fashioned manner have won the old man nothing but contempt from many doctors, although his regime was applauded publicly for introducing stringent new security at the institution. Sharp manages Arkham for three years before the game's storyline, but is completely focused on his own political aspirations, only dictating the treatment of high-profile patients to drum up support for a mayoral campaign. He is also delusional himself, suffering from [[multiple personality disorder]], which manifests itself in Quincy's belief that he is in fact a reincarnation of Amadeus Arkham. The former finally succeeds in becoming Gotham's latest and most controversial leader in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]''. He is voiced by [[Tom Kane]].

* '''Penelope Young''' <br> The director of Arkham Asylum's research department, Young has been tasked with rehabilitating particularly challenging patients. She has been corrupted over time by her fixation with research and experimentation, unwittingly allowing herself to be manipulated into conducting unethical experiments with [[Venom (DC Comics)|venom]] for the Joker. She was on route with Batman to the Warden's office, but a trap The Joker set killed her. She is voiced by [[Cree Summer]].

* '''Frank Boles''' <br> A chief member of Arkham's security force, Boles is arrogant, ill-tempered, and a hopeless [[alcoholic]]. He is openly accepting bribes from the inmates and has been reprimanded twice for intoxication on duty. Although more than willing to murder his own colleagues given the proper incentive, Boles also craves their admiration, hoping to depict himself as the most respected employee at the institution. Boles is voiced by [[Danny Jacobs (voice actor)|Danny Jacobs]].

* '''William North''' <br> A security guard at Arkham Asylum, one of the few incorruptible. Despite a hardened exterior, North seems to genuinely care for the welfare of his charges and secretly hopes to make a difference. Upon Poison Ivy's escape from custody, she seduces and brainwashes a number of asylum security personnel, including North, to become her reluctant bodyguards. He is voiced by [[Danny Rose (voice actor)|Danny Rose]].

* '''Commissioner Gordon''' <br> The Gotham police officer, he has helped Batman sometimes in the Asylum. At the whole game he is being kidnapped by Harley Quinn or The Joker.

==Inmates==
[[Image:BATMAN SHADOW OF THE BAT 82.jpg|190px|thumb|Some of Arkham's inmates. Cover to ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #82 (1999). Art by [[Glen Orbik]].]]
Originally, Arkham Asylum is used only to house genuinely insane patients having no connection to Batman, but over the course of the 1980s, a trend was established of having the majority of Batman's [[supervillain]] opponents end up at Arkham. Nearly all of Batman's enemies have spent some time in Arkham.

Arkham Asylum also features in other DC Universe publications. In [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[Swamp Thing]]'', The [[Floronic Man]] is detained there, and in ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics/Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' by [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Doctor Destiny]] escapes the asylum to wreak havoc on both the real and dream worlds. It has also been featured in varying capacities in a number of high profile DC miniseries events, such as ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]], [[Day of Vengeance]]'', ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'', and ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' among others.

==Graphic novels featuring Arkham Asylum==

===''The Dark Knight Returns''===
{{Main|The Dark Knight Returns}}
''The Dark Knight Returns'', written by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], takes place about 10 years after Batman "retires." It depicts an "Arkham Home for the Emotionally Troubled", presumably a renaming of the asylum which occurs as a result of the extreme [[political correctness]] which had evolved in Miller's [[dystopia]]n setting. The Joker is housed there, [[catatonia|catatonic]] since Batman's disappearance, but awakens when the vigilante resumes action. Under the employ of the home is Bartholemew Wolper, a condescending [[psychology|psychologist]] who treats the Joker humanely, even going so far to arrange for him to appear on a late night talk show, while arguing that Batman himself is responsible for the crimes his enemies commit by encouraging their existence; Wolper is killed when the Joker uses his lethal gas on the talk show audience.

In the sequel ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', it is revealed that the patients have taken over and have resorted to [[cannibalism]].  [[Plastic Man]] is one of the more notable patients in this version of Arkham Asylum.

''Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth'' is a [[graphic novel]] written by [[Grant Morrison]] and painted by [[Dave McKean]]. It was published by [[DC Comics|DC]] in 1989. It made reference to the treatment of several of the inmates, such as the attempt to wean Two-Face away from dependence on his coin for decision making, first with a die, and then a deck of cards. It once again portrays the asylum as having been taken over by its inmates.

''A Serious House on Serious Earth'' has been critically acclaimed, having been called "one of the finest superhero books to ever grace a bookshelf."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/626/626657p1.html |title=Batman: Arkham Asylum Review |author= Hilary Goldstein |work= IGN |date=17 June 2005 |accessdate=11 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110615071659/http://comics.ign.com/articles/626/626657p1.html| archivedate= 15 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> IGN ranked it as number four in a list of the 25 greatest Batman graphic novels, behind ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]'', ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns|The Dark Knight Returns]]'', and ''[[Batman: Year One|Year One]]'',<ref name="Top25">{{cite web |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/624/624619p1.html |title= The 25 Greatest Batman Graphic Novels |author= Hilary Goldstein |work=IGN |date=13 June 2005 |accessdate=11 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110615070336/http://comics.ign.com/articles/624/624619p1.html| archivedate= 15 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> whilst Forbidden Planet named it number eight in their "50 Best of the Best Graphic Novels" list.<ref name="FPlanet">{{cite web| url=http://forbiddenplanet.com/picks/50-best-graphic-novels/ |title=50 Best Of The Best Graphic Novels |publisher=[[Forbidden Planet (bookstore)|Forbidden Planet]] |accessdate=11 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110609212056/http://forbiddenplanet.com/picks/50-best-graphic-novels/| archivedate= 9 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===''Batman: The Last Arkham''===
{{Main|Batman: The Last Arkham}}

''Batman: The Last Arkham'' was written by [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]]; pencils by [[Norm Breyfogle]], originally a four-issue storyline that kicked off the ''[[Shadow of the Bat]]'' series. In it, the old Arkham Asylum is destroyed, to be replaced by a new and more modern facility. The story introduces Jeremiah Arkham, the asylum's director, and nephew of Amadeus Arkham. In an attempt to discover how criminals, specifically Zsasz, keep escaping, Batman has himself committed to the asylum. Jeremiah uses various methods, such as unleashing many inmates on Batman at once, in an attempt to gain psychological insight on the vigilante.

This story makes a few passing references to the  events of ''A Serious House on Serious Earth'', such as Amadeus Arkham taping over the mirror, and his journal is shown early in the story. Jeremiah also mentions his relative's descent into madness.

An episode of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' titled "Dreams in Darkness", also about Batman in Arkham, portrays a similar theme, with the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] as the chief villain, also replacing Jeremiah Arkham with a more nondescript administrator, who is portrayed as na<U+00EF>ve rather than sinister.

===''Arkham Asylum: Living Hell''===
''Living Hell'' was written by [[Dan Slott]], penciled by [[Ryan Sook]] with inks by Sook, [[Wade Von Grawbadger]] and [[Jim Royal]]. The series was edited by [[Valerie D'Orazio]]. [[Eric Powell (comic writer)|Eric Powell]] created the painted cover art which appeared on both the original series and graphic novel compilation.

This six-issue [[miniseries]] and the subsequent trade paperback provided an intricate and multi-layered look at Arkham Asylum from several points of view: director [[Jeremiah Arkham|Dr. Jeremiah Arkham]]; psychiatrist Dr. Anne Carver; the guards, chiefly one Aaron Cash; and the inmates. There is a particular focus on previously unknown residents: [[Jane Doe (comics)|Jane Doe]], a [[wikt:Cypher|cypher]] who assumes the identities of those she kills; Junkyard Dog, a man obsessed with trash; Doodlebug, an artist who uses blood in his paintings; the hulking bruiser Lunkhead; Death Rattle, a [[cult]] leader who speaks to the dead; and [[Humpty Dumpty (comics)|Humpty Dumpty]], an [[obese]] [[idiot savant]] obsessed with taking apart and repairing various objects. The driving force is the recent incarceration of a ruthless investor, [[Great White (comics)|Warren "The Great White Shark" White]], as well as the [[demon]]ic element suggested by the title. White, facing charges of massive [[fraud]], [[insanity plea|pleads insanity]] and has himself committed to Arkham. He soon realizes the horrors of the place and tries to survive. Ultimately, he is locked in a freezer and suffers facial wounds, coming to resemble his nickname. The demonic threat is nullified after the sacrifice of several patients.

===''Black Orchid''===
''Black Orchid'', written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and illustrated by [[Dave McKean]], also featured Arkham Asylum. The award-winning graphic novel introduced an updated version of the crimefighter [[Black Orchid]], who dies, is reborn and starts a quest to find her identity. During this she encounters Batman, who directs her to Arkham Asylum, where she meets [[Mad Hatter (comics)|The Mad Hatter]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], Two-Face and the Joker. Arkham is viewed as a desperate place where inmates dwell in madness and terror, much in the same fashion as in ''A Serious House on Serious Earth'', which was also illustrated by McKean.

===''Arkham Reborn''===
''Arkham Reborn'' is a three-part mini-series written by David Hine and illustrated by Jeremy Haun. It tells the story of the rebuilding of the Asylum after having been destroyed by [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] during the events of "Battle for the Cowl".

In ''Batman'' #697, it is revealed that Dr. Jeremiah Arkham is the new Black Mask. More is revealed about Dr. Jeremiah Arkham in ''Detective Comics'' #864 and #865.

===''Batman: The Man Who Laughs''===
{{Main|Batman: The Man Who Laughs}}
''The Man Who Laughs'' is a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[prestige format]] [[comic book]] written by [[Ed Brubaker]] and illustrated by [[Doug Mahnke]] and [[Patrick Zircher]], released in February 2005. The comic reveals some of the asylum's dark history. As a reporter reports on the asylum's renovation, the Joker poisons her and the crew, stealing the news van to broadcast whenever he wants. He later releases criminally insane patients at Williams Medical Center, who, in a short number of weeks, would have been transferred to Arkham Asylum. In the end, Joker is defeated and he himself locked behind bars, in a [[straightjacket]] at Arkham.

{{anchor|Made of Wood}}
The graphic novel was reprinted with ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #784-786<U+2013>a storyline entitled "Made of Wood," also written by Brubaker with art by Zircher. In the storyline, [[Batman]] and [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]] track the "Made of Wood" serial killer, whose killing spree was cut short when he was sentenced to Arkham Asylum. Ex-Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] is also pursuing the killer, and he narrows the search down to the two men committed to Arkham in December 1948, the only living one hardly able to walk and ignorant of the killings. Gordon reaches the grandson of the other, who has taken up the "Made of Wood" killer's mantle.

==Other versions==

===JLA; The Nail===
In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', the Joker- using Kryptonian gauntlets provided by a genetically augmented [[Jimmy Olsen]]- breaks into the Asylum, erecting a forcefield around it that prevents anyone but Batman, Batgirl and Robin from entering, while forcing the rest of the inmates to fight each other for a chance to live as his slave when only one is left standing. Catwoman wins the resulting conflict shortly before Batman breaks into the asylum, but the Joker's gauntlets allow him to capture Batman, forcing him to watch as the Joker brutally tears Batgirl and Robin apart in front of him. Although Catwoman manages to distract the Joker long enough for Batman to escape and damage his gauntlets, the grief-maddened Batman subsequently beats the Joker to death on the asylum roof before the entire building collapses, apparently killing most of the current inmates (Although he and Catwoman manage to escape).

===Batman: Crimson Mist===
In ''Batman: Crimson Mist''- the third part of the trilogy that began with ''[[Batman & Dracula: Red Rain]]''-, the now-vampiric Batman breaks into the asylum and murders all the homicidal inmates- including [[Amygdala (comics)|Amygdala]], [[Victor Zsasz]] and the [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]]-, drinking their blood and chopping off their heads to prevent them coming back as vampires.

==In other media==
As an integral part of the Batman franchise, Arkham Asylum has been featured in other media besides the print comics, including the following:

===Television===

[[Image:Arkham Asylum TB.jpg|240px|thumb|Arkham Asylum as it appeared on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' TV series.]]

* Arkham Asylum is mentioned by Barry Allen, who is secretly [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]], in an episode of ''[[The Flash (TV series)|The Flash]]'' television series.
* In ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', Arkham has appeared frequently in the series. It is depicted as generally dark and gloomy, and the cells are similar to those in the comics, being primarily closed via glass doors. Much of the rest of the asylum resembles a prison more than a mental hospital, as the episode "The Trial" explains that all insane criminals apprehended by the Batman are sent to Arkham rather than jail, although it is shown that the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] and [[Catwoman]] get sentenced to [[Blackgate Penitentiary|Blackgate]], a regular jail, determining that they are sane and accountable for their crimes.
* The television show ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' featured Arkham in a brief [[cameo role|cameo]] during ''A Better World, Part 2'' in an alternate dimension where a [[Fascist]] League has taken over the world and dispatches villains via execution or [[lobotomy]]. The asylum is run by a lobotomized version of the Joker, and staffed by other lobotomized Batman villains, including [[Two-Face]] as the caretaker and [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] as the gardener, and is protected by robotic copies of [[Superman]]. The entire inmate population is lobotomized by the alternate Superman's heat vision. The Joker, Two-Face and Poison Ivy are used in both ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''Justice League'' as the key inmates of the Asylum.
* Arkham Asylum appears in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. Like the original Arkham, several major villains end up in this institution, such as the Joker, Harley Quinn, the Riddler, Mr. Freeze, the Ventriloquist, Hugo Strange, Clayface, and Penguin. [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]] goes to a regular prison, until becoming [[Doctor Phosphorus|Phosphorus]], who requires special chemical care. The staff is far more heavily armored than in its previous incarnation, wearing heavy trenchcoats and gloves, though inmates continue to escape easily. Much like in the ''Batman Forever'' tie-in game and ''Batman Begins'', it is presented as being inside Gotham, though here it is presented as occupying a small island on a river, with a bridge connecting it to the city.
* Arkham Asylum is seen in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Mayhem of the Music Meister". Music Meister visits the place, and forces the prisoners to sing. [[Calendar Man]], [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], King Tut, [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Psycho-Pirate]], [[Doctor Polaris]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], [[Two-Face]], [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]], [[Top (comics)|Top]], [[Crazy Quilt]], and [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee (comics)|Tweedledum and Tweedledee]] are shown as inmates of Arkham Asylum.

===Films===
<!-- did not appear in ''Batman'' or ''Batman Returns'' -->
* In ''[[Batman Forever]]'', Arkham Asylum was seen at the end of the film. It is designed as a tall, spiraling castle-like structure, with narrow hallways lined with brightly lit glass bricks. The Riddler is incarcerated in a large padded cell. The chief psychiatrist is named Doctor Burton, a reference to [[Tim Burton]], who directed 1989's ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' and 1992's ''[[Batman Returns]]''. There was originally a more in-depth sequence involving Two-Face escaping from Arkham at the beginning of the film, but it was cut.
* In ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdactive.com/reviews/dvd/batman-and-robin.html |title=Review of '&#39;Batman & Robin'&#39; |publisher=DVD Active.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref> Arkham Asylum is shown a number of times. It first appears when Mr. Freeze is taken there midway through the film, and later at the end when he and Poison Ivy are shown as cell-mates. This version is several dozen stories tall on an island several hundred feet above water, into which the villains jump to escape. Lightning also emits a bright green flash through the structure's windows. In addition, The Riddler and Two-Face's costumes from ''[[Batman Forever]]'' can be seen in an evidence room before Bane breaks out to collect Mr. Freeze's armor.
* In ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'', the final battle between the original Batman and the Joker taking place at an abandoned Arkham. It is also the same spot where [[Tim Drake|Robin]], [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] and disfigured into a younger version of the Joker, kills the real Joker. A deleted scene, featured on both versions of the DVD as a special feature, has Bruce Wayne touring the abandoned Arkham, where Bruce Wayne's successor as Batman [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]], follows and sees the Joker's corpse hanging. Both the film and the ''Batman Beyond'' episode "Splicer" suggest that the facility has moved to a different location.
* In ''[[Batman Begins]]'', Arkham plays a much larger role than the previous films, with [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Jonathan Crane]] (also known as the Scarecrow) being either the administrator or a high-ranking doctor at the Asylum, and using it to conduct [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] experiments with his fear gas, with his own patients as [[guinea pig]]s. He also uses the pipes under the asylum to empty his toxin into the Gotham water supply. Though still on an island separate from Gotham City's mainland, it is surrounded by a [[slum]] region known as the Narrows, instead of the dense forestry of the comics. When it came to a diversion for the fear gas to infect Gotham's water supply, Ra's al Ghul had his men release all the inmates at Arkham Asylum to keep the police busy. By the end of the film, it is implied that the Narrows has been rendered uninhabitable. Notably, [[Victor Zsasz]] is shown as a high-profile criminal being held in the asylum. The [[National Institute for Medical Research]], Mill Hill, London was used as Arkham in the film.<ref>http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/606532.0/?utag=8269</ref>
* Arkham makes an appearance in the animated direct-to-[[DVD]] anthology film ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'' (set between ''[[Batman Begins]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'') within the segment "Crossfire". Expanding on Lt. James Gordon's line that "the Narrows is lost" at the end of ''Batman Begins'', the film shows that the entire island has become Arkham Asylum's ground, with Narrows residents evacuated from the island after the inmates escaped from the facility. After the riot at the end of ''Batman Begins'', the city apparently turned the entire island into a high-tech prison facility in a few months after the incident, enclosed by guard towers, high fences, and the island's natural barrier to keep the inmates from escaping. The [[Gotham City Police Department]] also sends officers to its drawbridges to make sure no one would cross, in or out, without permission.
* Arkham is mentioned briefly by Harvey Dent, Batman, and [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] in the ''Batman Begins'' sequel, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' when they reference Arkham patients Carmine Falcone and Thomas Schiff, but beyond this instance the asylum is never seen or explored in the story.
*In ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', although the asylum is never seen, it is mentioned that all inmates [[Joker_(comics)|except for one]] were moved to the [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] as the result of the effect [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]]'s death had upon [[Gotham City]] and its administration.

===Video games===
* In ''[[Batman Forever (video game)|Batman Forever]]'' ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] game), Arkham Asylum is the first stage.
* The game [[Batman: Toxic Chill]] [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] are taken to "Arkham" [[Riddler]] and his companion [[Mr. Freeze]] and define them in the same room.
* A crucial showdown takes place in Arkham in ''[[Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu]]''.
* Arkham is featured prominently in ''[[Batman: Dark Tomorrow]]''. Three quarters of the way through the game, Batman must infiltrate Arkham Asylum through a secret sewer entrance.
* Arkham Asylum is one of the levels of the video game counterpart to ''[[Batman Begins]]''.
* Arkham Asylum works as the main hub for the villains in ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame]]'', whereas the [[Batcave]] works as the main hub for the heroes of the game.
* ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'' is a video game for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[Microsoft Windows]]. It was developed by [[Rocksteady Studios]] and published by [[Eidos Interactive]] in conjunction with [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] and DC Comics. The game takes place entirely on Arkham Island, a large island on the middle of the Gotham bay. The game's version of Arkham is similar to its description in ''Gotham Knight'', consisting of individual large buildings in a spacious open air island, rather than a single compound. Its locations include Arkham East, Arkham West, Arkham North, Arkham Mansion, the Botanical Gardens, Intensive Treatment, Medical Facility, and Penitentiary. The island also features a network of subterranean catacombs, caverns, sewers, and a satellite [[Batcave]] which Batman had outfitted over the years in preparation for emergencies like the one he faces in the game. In the game, a fire had broke out at [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] causing its inmates to be temporarily housed at Arkham. When Joker was recently apprehended, he was freed by Harley Quinn as Joker begins his plot to take over Arkham Asylum.
* Arkham Asylum appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]''. In the game, the chaos of Brainiac's invasions ends up enabling Arkham Asylum's inmates to escape from Arkham Asylum. In the "Arkham Asylum Alert" mission, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, and Scarecrow take over Arkham Asylum. In the hero campaign, Batman sends the players to investigate and bring the situation under control. In the villain campaign, Joker sends the players to find out what's going on at his "house" and find out why he wasn't invited.
* In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'' (the sequel to ''Batman: Arkham Asylum''), Arkham has been relocated to the Gotham mainland as part of Quincy Sharp's Arkham City project with neither Blackgate Penitentiary or Arkham Asylum in any condition to hold inmates after it was ravaged by the Joker in the first game. Arkham Asylum itself can be seen from the bay of Arkham City, still ravaged and covered in vines from Poison Ivy's attack.

===Toys===
* The [[Lego Batman]] series includes an Arkham Asylum Lego set featuring [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], and [[Riddler]] (there are also cells labeled, "The Joker", "Two-Face", and "The Penguin"). It was available at [[Toys "R" Us]] during the summer of 2006. It also included [[Nightwing]] with his motorcycle and two [[eskrima]] sticks, and [[Batman]] in the Bat-glider.
