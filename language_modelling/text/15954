The '''War in Somalia''' has been an [[armed conflict]] involving largely [[Ethiopia]]n and [[Somalia|Somali]] [[Transitional Federal Parliament|Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG) forces and Somali troops from [[Puntland]] versus the Somali [[Islamist]] [[Umbrella organization|umbrella group]], the [[Islamic Court Union]] (ICU), and other affiliated militias for control of the country. The war officially began shortly before July 20, 2006 when U.S. backed Ethiopian troops invaded Somalia to prop up the TFG in [[Baidoa]]<ref>"Somalian Islamists Demand Ethiopian Troops Withdraw" 20 July 2006, Dow Jones International News</ref>. The TFG in Somalia invited Ethiopians to intervene, which became an "unpopular decision" that failed to strengthen the government. <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7804335.stm President Yusuf made the failed and unpopular decision to call in troops from neighbouring Ethiopia]</ref> Subsequently the leader of the ICU, [[Hassan Aweys|Sheik Hassan Dahir Aweys]], declared "Somalia is in a [[state of war]], and all [[Somali people|Somalis]] should take part in this struggle against Ethiopia".<ref name= "CARNAGE-AS-SOMALIA-IN-STATE-OF-WAR">{{cite news

The ICU, which controlled the coastal areas of southern Somalia, engaged in fighting with the forces of the Somali TFG, and the autonomous regional governments of [[Puntland]] and [[Galmudug]], all of whom were backed by Ethiopian troops. The outbreak of heavy fighting began on December 20 with the [[Battle of Baidoa]], after the lapse of a one-week deadline the ICU imposed on Ethiopia (on December 12) to withdraw from the nation.<ref name= "SOMALI-ISLAMISTS-GIVE-ETHIOPIA-ONE-WEEK-TO-WITHDRAW-TROOPS"> {{cite news

On December 29, after several successful battles, TFG and Ethiopian troops [[Fall of Mogadishu|entered Mogadishu]] relatively unopposed. The UN also stated that many Arab nations including Libya and Egypt were also supporting the ICU via Eritrea. Although not announced until later, a small number of U.S. special forces troops accompanied Ethiopian and TFG troops after the collapse and withdrawal of the ICU to give military advice and to track suspected al-Qaida fighters.<ref name="Fleet">{{cite news |title=Al-Qaida suspects still alive in Somalia |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/somalia |publisher=AP |date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=2007-01-11}}</ref> Both American support for the TFG and various Arab Nations' support for the ICU were isolated cases from the central motive of the war between the allied Ethiopian & Somali government forces and the allied ICU & Eritrean forces.

As of January 2007, Ethiopia said it would withdraw "within a few weeks"<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jan/03/mainsection.international14 Ethiopian troops to leave Somalia 'within weeks' | World news | The Guardian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but the TFG, US and UN officials oppose Ethiopian withdrawal because it would create a "security vacuum," while the ICU has demanded immediate Ethiopian withdrawal. <ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080602/wl_africa_afp/somaliaunresttalksdjiboutiun_080602190413 disputes with Ethiopian withdrawal from Somalia]</ref>

The two sides had traded war declarations and gun fire on several occasions before. Eastern African countries and international observers fear the Ethiopian offensive may lead to a regional war, involving [[Eritrea]], a long-time enemy of Ethiopia, who Ethiopia claims to be a supporter of the ICU.<ref>{{cite press release

As of January 2009, Ethiopian troops withdrew from Somalia following a two year insurgency which lead to loss of territory and effectiveness of the TFG and a power sharing deal between Islamists splinter group led by [[Sharif Ahmed|Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed]]'s [[Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia]] (ARS) and TFG Prime Minister Nur Hassan in Djibouti. The al Shabaab who has separated from the ICU rejects the peace deal and continued to take territories including Baidoa. Another islamist group Ahlu Sunnah Waljama'ah, which is allied to the transitional government and supported by Ethiopia, continues to attack al Shabab and take over towns as well.<ref>[http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/africa/news/article_1456455.php/Moderate_Islamists_seize_town_from_Somali_insurgents_ Moderate Islamists seize town from Somali insurgents]</ref><ref>[http://www.mareeg.com/fidsan.php?sid=10277&tirsan=3 Moderate Islamic group claims victory over rival hardline group]</ref> <ref>[http://ethioforum.org/wp/archives/759 Ahlu Suna Wal Jamea supported by Ethiopian government]</ref>

==Forces involved==
The scope of forces involved are difficult to calculate because of many factors, including lack of formal organization or record-keeping, and claims which remained masked by [[disinformation]]. Ethiopia for months leading up to the war maintained it had only a few hundred advisors in the country. Yet independent reports indicated far more troops. According to the [[BBC]], "The United Nations estimated that at least 8,000 Ethiopian troops may be in the country while the AP suggests the number closer to 12-15,000,<ref>{{cite news  | title =Remnants of Somalia Islamists still pose a threat - official  | publisher =[[Associated Press]]  | date =2007-01-04  | url=http://www.dehai.org/archives/dehai_news_archive/0090.html  | accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}</ref> while regional rival Eritrea has deployed some 2,000 troops in support of the Islamic group."<ref name= BBC2> {{cite news

== Background ==
{{main|Ethiopian-Somali conflict}}
===Historic background===
Wars between Somalia, or its precursor Islamic states, and Ethiopia, stretch back to 16th century. For example, [[Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi]] was a 16th century Islamic leader popular in Somali culture for his [[History of Somalia#The Rise of Adal .26 the Ethiopian Empire|jihad against the Ethiopians]] during the rise of the [[Adal Sultanate]]. The painful living history, oral and cultural traditions, long-standing ethnic divisions and sectarian differences lay a foundation of conflict between the two nations.

More recently, boundary disputes over the [[Ogaden]] region date to the 1948 settlement when the land was [[History of Somalia#Ogaden Granted to Ethiopia|granted to Ethiopia]]. Somali disgruntlement with this decision has led to repeated attempts to invade Ethiopia with the hopes of taking control of the Ogaden to create a [[Greater Somalia]].  This plan would have reunited the Somali people of the Ethiopian-controlled Ogaden with those living in the Republic of Somalia. These ethnic and political tensions have caused cross-border clashes over the years.

While it is true the ICU made threats to carry the war into Ethiopia, the circumstances referred to were in part due to prior Ethiopian actions in response to historical conflicts in the region. Before [[proxy war]]s between Ethiopia and Eritrea began in the late 1990s, ICU was helping rebels inside Eastern Ethiopia against the Ethiopian government. Thus Ethiopia's involvement in Somalia had begun months before, with the intercession of forces to support the establishment of the transitional government, and to support other regional governments considered more acceptable to Ethiopia so that ICU won't be able to support more insurgents inside Eastern Ethiopia.<ref name=AN-INTERIM-AGREEMENT-GIVES-ISLAMISTS-AN-EDGE>{{cite news

=== Information Warfare, Disinformation and Propaganda ===
{{main|Propaganda in the War in Somalia}}

Even before the beginning of the war, there have been significant assertions and accusations of the use of [[disinformation]] and [[propaganda]] tactics by various parties to shape the causes and course of the conflict. This includes assertions of falsification of the presence or number of forces involved, exaggeration or minimization of the casualties inflicted or taken, influence or control of media outlets (or shutting them down), and other informational means and media to sway popular support and international opinion.

On December 8, 2006, fighters from Somalia's Islamic Courts Union clashed with Somalian government forces, allegedly in cooperation with Ethiopian troops. Sheikh [[Sharif Sheikh Ahmed]], head of the Islamic Courts, told a crowd in [[Mogadishu]] that fighting had started in [[Dinsor]] in the south, and called on all Somalis to "stand up and defeat the enemies".<ref>{{cite news

The Deputy Defence Minister of the Somali government, Salat Ali Jelle, confirmed the fighting but denied any Ethiopian troops were involved. The Ethiopian government has denied repeated claims that its troops are fighting alongside Somali government militia.

Witnesses in [[Dagaari]] village near Bandiradley said that they saw hundreds of Ethiopian troops and tanks take up positions near the town with militiamen from the northeastern semi-autonomous region of [[Puntland]].<ref>{{cite news

On December 9, fighters from Somalia's Islamic Courts and government soldiers clashed in a second day of fighting. The fighting occurred 40 kilometers from the interim government's headquarters in Baidoa. Mohamed Ibrahim Bilal, an Islamic Courts official, said that the government had launched a counterattack at Rama'addey village, while [[Ali Mohamed Gedi]], the prime minister, claimed that Islamic Courts fighters had attacked government positions.<ref>{{cite news

On December 23, Ethiopian tanks and further reinforcements arrived in Daynuunay, 30 kilometres east of Baidoa; prompting ICU forces to vow all-out war despite a commitment to an EU-brokered peace.

On December 24, Ethiopia admitted its troops were fighting the 
Islamists, after stating earlier in the week it had only sent several hundred
military advisors to Baidoa. Heavy fighting erupted in border areas, with reports of air strikes and shelling, including targets near the ICU-held town of Beledweyne.

On December 27, Ethiopian and Somali government forces were en route to Somalia's capital, Mogadishu after capturing the strategic town of Jowhar, 90km north from the capital. The ICU were in control of little more than the coast, abandoning many towns without putting up a fight. Also, the ICU top two commanders, defense chief [[Yusuf Mohammed Siad Inda'ade]] and his deputy Abu Mansur were away on the Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca.<ref name=advance> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6211573.stm Ethiopians nearing Somali capital] BBC News </ref>

===2007===
{{main|Timeline of the War in Somalia: 2007}}

Military events in January 2007 focused on the southern section of Somalia, primarily the [[Fall of Kismayo|withdrawal of ICU forces]] from [[Kismayo]], and their pursuit using Ethiopian air strikes in Afmadow district concurrent to the [[Battle of Ras Kamboni]]. During this battle, the U.S. launched an airstrike conducted by an [[AC-130]] gunship against suspected [[Al-Qaeda]] operatives. A second airstrike was made after the battle later in January 2007.<ref name=US-SECOND-AIRSTRIKE>{{cite news

Within a week of the TFG and Ethiopian army<U+2019>s arrival in Mogadishu, the first insurgent attacks began. Ethiopian and TFG forces responded by sealing off areas around the attack sites and conducting house-to-house searches. The TFG also passed a three-month emergency law in parliament and called for a [[Disarmament in Somalia|disarmament of the militias]] on January 13, 2007. The provisions of the emergency law gave the TFG much wider powers and allowed President Yusuf to rule by decree.

Between January and March 2007, insurgent attacks took several forms: assassinations of government officials; attacks on military convoys; and [[rocket-propelled grenade]] or [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] attacks on police stations, TFG and Ethiopian military bases, or other locations or individuals deemed by the insurgency to be political or military targets. For instance, several hotels known to accommodate TFG officials, such as the Ambassador, Global, and Lafweyne Hotels, were repeatedly hit with RPGs and mortar rounds and were the site of attempted assassinations of TFG officials. <ref name=autogenerated1>[http://hrw.org/reports/2007/somalia0807/4.htm#_ftnref107 Somalia: Shell-Shocked: Civilians Under Siege in Mogadishu: IV.

[[Image:Somalia 2007 12 08.png|thumb|right|Situation in Somalia in December 2007]]

The insurgency was mobile, often using hit-and-run tactics in its attacks or setting up and launching mortar rounds within minutes, then melting back into the civilian population. <ref name=autogenerated1 /> After an insurgent attack on a convoy or other mobile target, Ethiopian and TFG forces typically sealed off the area and conducted house-to-house searches of the area. The Ethiopian and TFG response to mortar attacks increasingly included the return firing of mortars and rockets in the direction of origin of insurgency fire. In the beginning of March, the first 1,500 [[African Union Mission to Somalia]] soldiers begun arriving in Somalia. 

By the end of March, the fighting [[Battle of Mogadishu (2007)|intensified in Mogadishu]] and more than a thousand people, mostly civilians, were killed. [[Hawiye]] clan militiamen allied with the Islamists clashed with TFG and Ethiopian troops. 

After the end of that battle in April in which heavy weapons were used and turned parts of Mogadishu into ashes, the allied forces of Somalia and Ethiopia were said to have won over the local insurgents. Since May 2007 it has been increasingly apparent that the March and April fighting did not stem the insurgency. The insurgents started a low level but very effective violence campaign including suicide bombings, hit and run missions and hunting high-profile government officials. <ref>[http://www.somalinet.com/news/world/Somalia/10921 Latest News - SomaliNet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In December 2007, the Ethiopian troops withdrew from the town of [[Guriel]], and the Islamists controlled Guriel after that. Ethiopia had a big military base there to secure the road linking the two countries.<ref>{{cite news | title =Ethiopia leaves key Somali town| publisher =BBC| date=December 28, 2007| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7162957.stm | accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref>

By the end of December 2007, the ICU forces had taken control of about half of the port city of Kismayo, around half the districts of Mogadishu, and totalling around 80% of their former territories, leaving the Ethopiean-backed regime in the same precarious situation as it was in Baidoa at the start of 2007.<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/70C40F0B-95D1-43F4-A5F6-963241DA7C89.htm Somalia says rebels regrouping]</ref>

===2008===

{{main|2008 timeline of the War in Somalia}}
A report by AU Commission Chairman [[Alpha Konare]] on 18 January claimed that forces opposed to the Somali government have expanded their insurgent activities to areas that were previously peaceful and could be planning attacks in the Middle and Lower Juba regions. Armed elements, it added, were also reported to be using the Lower Shabelle region to ferry arms.<ref>[http://www.somalinet.com/news/world/Somalia/14368 Latest News - SomaliNet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In February 2008, the Insurgents captured the town of [[Dinsoor]] after probing it several times.

After long talks in [[Djibouti]] over a ceasefire between the TFG and the moderate islamists of the [[Alliance for the Reliberation of Somalia]], agreement was reached that the parliament would be doubled in size to include 200 representatives of the opposition alliance and 75 representatives of the civil society.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7751090.stm</ref> A new president and prime minister would be elected by the new parliament, and a commission to look into crimes of war would be established.<ref>http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90855/6541282.html</ref> A new constitution was also agreed to be drafted shortly.<ref>http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/485996/-/tlij7p/-/</ref> In early December 2008, Ethiopia announced it would withdraw its troops from Somalia shortly, and later announced that it would first help secure the withdrawal of the [[AMISOM]] peacekeepers from [[Burundi]] and [[Uganda]] before withdrawing.

===2009===
{{main|2009 timeline of the War in Somalia}}
Ethiopian troops on December 31, 2008 were seen by civilians packing up supplies and forwarding troop deployments except in the city of Mogadishu. December 31, 2008 was suppose to be when the troops were to withdraw from Somalia but it appears it will be several weeks after the resignation of [[Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed|President Yusuf]] earlier in December. With a power vacuum growing it is unknown who will capitalize on the
situation.<ref>http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Headlines_Dec_31_2008.shtml</ref>

On January 25, 2009, Ethiopian troops completely pulled out of Somalia.<ref>http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090125/ap_on_re_af/af_ethiopia_somalia_withdrawal_2</ref> While the Ethiopian government claimed mission accomplished in its effort to give TFG presense in Mogadishu to leed to a coalition government, most saw Ethiopia's intervention was a failure, given the Islamists' quick advance following the Ethiopian withdrawal.

Al-Shabab captured Baidoa, where the TFG parliament was based, on January 26. Following the colapse of the TFG, pro-TFG moderate Islamist group Ahlu Sunnah continued to fight al-Shabaab and captured a few towns. Moderate Islamist leader Sheikh Sharif Ahmed was elected to become the new President of a United Somali government signalling the end of the Transitional Federal Government marked by the resignation of Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed the previous month and a joint unity government of the ARS-TFG. Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, 42, has promised to "forge peace with east African neighbors, tackle rampant piracy offshore and rein in hardline insurgents"<ref>http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/reuters/090131/world/international_us_somalia_conflict</ref><ref>http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Headlines_Dec_31_2008.shtml</ref>. Some, like the deputy major of Mogadishu Abdelfatah, said that the Ethiopian intervention was instrumental in establishing the internationally-recognised government in the capital.<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/200902020072.html Evaluating Ethiopia's presence]</ref> However, most of the territory that came under the control of the new ARS-TFG government was in fact under the control of the moderate wing of the insurgency, the ARS, which was made up mostly of former members of the Islamic Courts Union.

"Analysts say Ahmed has a real possibility of reuniting Somalis, given his Islamist roots, the backing of parliament and a feeling in once hostile Western nations that he should now be given a chance to try to stabilize the Horn of Africa nation"<ref>http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/reuters/090131/world/international_us_somalia_conflict</ref>.

New TFG President Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed arrived in Mogadishu as a president for the first time on February 7, 2009. The al Shabaab and other radical islamists began firing at the new TFG president hours later. They accuse the new President of accepting the secular transitional government. <Ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g7OaI4_kjeHA-o4UhlmP7vlWmrrwD966RU880 radical islamists attack new president Ahmed's palace]</ref>

Mediation has begun between the Islamic Party and the Transitional Government of Sharif as well as a growing divide is being reported in the Al Shabeeb organization that controls much of southern Somalia as a large number of Al Shabeeb leaders that held positions in government during the six month reign of the Islamic Courts Union in 2006 have met behind closed doors with the President of the Transitional Government and the TFG have announced that Sharia law will be implemented in Somalia, but it has not acted on it.<ref>http://allafrica.com/stories/200902100035.html</ref><ref>http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-02-10-voa18.cfm</ref> TFG President Sharif's moderate islamist forces and AU troops clashed with the Islamic Party and al Shabaab forces, leading to atleast 23 death. <ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j5Ibi8LC53YeE4VvNhSdN3YxlSmQ Violent clashes in Mogadishu kill 23]</ref> Moderate islamist and other pro-TFG militias are allegedly being trained by Ethiopia, while the newly formed Islamist Party is established by Eritrea based Sheikh Aweys. 

====Ahlu Sunnah====

Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jamee'a militias attacked al Shabab islamists in central Somalia including killing an islamist commander. Ahlu Sunnah clan militias, reportedly armed by Ethiopia, retook control of Galgadud's provincial capital Dhusamareb and the trading town of Guri El in fierce battles that killed upwards of 100 people. <ref>[http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/4_killed_in_central_Somalia_battle_incl_Al_Shabaab_commander.shtml Ethiopia-armed clan militias defeat islamist insurgents]</ref>

== Consequences ==
=== Casualties and displacement ===
As of December 2008, The [[Elman Peace and Human Rights Organisation]] said it had verified that 16,210 civilians had been killed and 29,000 wounded since the start of the insurgency in December 2006.<ref>http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2008/12/10/africa/OUKWD-UK-SOMALIA-CONFLICT-TOLL.php</ref>. In September of that year they had documented 1,9 million displaced civilians from homes in Mogadishu alone during the year 2007.<ref>http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/AMMF-7JJCSY?OpenDocument</ref><ref name=autogenerated3>[http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2008/06/26/africa/OUKWD-UK-SOMALIA-CONFLICT.php Somalia conflict kills more than 2,100 this year - International Herald Tribune<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In June 2008, former Somali president [[Abdi Qasim Salad Hassan]] suggested that Ethiopian troops killed up to 2000 civilians during the war.<ref>http://www.shabelle.net/english/2008/06/25/former-somali-leader-blames-ethiopian-troops-%E2%80%9Cmassacre%E2%80%9D</ref>

The Ethiopian military casualties are hard to verify. The Ethiopian PM Meles Zenawi announced 500 dead in the initial invasion phase (Dec. 2006 - Jan. 2007).<ref>[http://www.shabelle.net/news/ne2163.htm Gunmen shoot dead an Ethiopian soldier in southern Somalia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Hizbul Shabaab]]'s senior commander said to Reuters on December 16, 2007 it had killed nearly 500 Ethiopian soldiers in the insurgency phase.<ref>[http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=327868&area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__africa/ Somali insurgency to intensify : Mail & Guardian Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

=== War crimes ===
Based on dozens of eyewitness accounts gathered by [[Human Rights Watch]] in a six-week research mission to Kenya and Somalia in April and May 2007, plus subsequent interviews and research in June and July, report was released by the HRW that documents the illegal means and methods of warfare allegedly used by all of the warring parties and the resulting catastrophic toll on civilians in Mogadishu. In South Mogadishu, dead bodies of women, children and elders as well as animals are scattered on the district's streets and there are no civilians living in Southern Mogadishu as they have moved to [[Afgoie]]. Ethiopians soldiers have looted shops including the Bakara market in South Mogadishu. [http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=30693&sectionid=351020501] Many Mogadishu residents also complain that Somali soldiers, who are often rarely paid in time or at all, extort money from drivers at checkpoints or openly steal from merchants.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/28/africa/somalia.php] Islamists gain ground in Somalia</ref>

In a report in May 2008, [[Amnesty International]] condemned violence committed on civilians by all warring parties, especially the Ethiopians. According to it, witnesses told Amnesty International of an increasing incidence of what it locally termed as <U+201C>slaughtering<U+201D> or <U+201C>killing like goats<U+201D> by Ethiopian troops, referring to killing by slitting the throat. The victims of these killings are often left lying in pools of blood in the streets until armed fighters, including snipers, move out of the area and relatives can collect their bodies.<ref>[http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/routine-killings-civilians-somalia-20080506 Routine killings of civilians in Somalia | Amnesty International<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Such crimes were exposed after the alleged [[Hidaya Mosque massacre]], which occurred on April 20, 2008 and saw Ethiopian troops slaughtering civilians according to AI.

===Repression of press freedom===
An Amnesty International report released in March 2008 stated that "journalists in Somalia were being killed for reporting the truth about the country's bloody conflict, according to research by Amnesty International." At least nine journalists were killed since February 2007, five of them in intentionally targeted attacks. Many more were threatened, arbitrarily arrested and harassed. Over 50 journalists fled the country. The crackdown on independent media saw newspapers and radio stations forcibly shut down.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/feature-stories/killed-telling-truth-20080303 Killed for telling the truth | Amnesty International<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 2007, these closures were steadily increasing in duration, with [[Shabelle Radio]] and [[Simba Radio]] closed from November 12 until December 3 by the Governor of Banadir Region and Mayor of Mogadishu, [[Mohamed Dheere]].<ref name=autogenerated2 />


===Coalition Government===

Prime Minister Nur Hassan of the transitional government and Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed of opposition group Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS) signed a power sharing deal in Djibouti that was brokered by the United Nations. According to the deal, Ethiopian troops withdrew from Somalia, giving their bases to the transitional government, African Union (AU) peacekeepers and moderate Islamist groups led by ARS. Following the Ethiopian withdrawal, the transitional government expanded its parliament to include the opposition and elected Sheikh Ahmed as its new president on January 31, 2009.


== Suicide attacks ==
Islamist fighters in Somalia opened a completely new aspect to the Somali Civil War: suicide attacks. Here is a list of reported attacks:
*In late 2006 two suicide bombings were reported in Baidoa, where the government was stationed at the time. 
*At the start of April 2007, Al-Jazeera TV aired footage of a Somali man, speaking in Arabic and reciting [[Koran]]ic verses. They then showed an [[SUV]] full of what appeared to be explosives driving towards an Ethiopian compound, followed by a large explosion.
