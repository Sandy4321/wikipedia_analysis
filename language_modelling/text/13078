The '''Wittman V-Witt''' also called '''Witts V''' and '''Witt's Vee'''<ref name="P&P">Plane and Pilot: ''1978 Aircraft Directory'', page 160. Werner & Werner Corp, Santa Monica CA, 1977. ISBN 0-918312-00-0</ref> is single-engine [[tube-and-fabric construction]] aircraft specifically made for [[Formula V Air Racing]].
<!-- ==Development== -->
==Design==
The aircraft is made of welded steel tube [[fuselage]] with [[Aircraft fabric|fabric covering]]. The thin-profile wings are wire-supported. The engine requires a 12-inch extension to mount the propeller ahead of a streamlined cowling.<ref>{{cite journal|magazine=Air Trails|date=Winter 1971|page=11}}</ref>

==Operational history==
The Witts V was flown in races and demonstrations from 1972 through 1981. 

The prototype aircraft is on display at the [[EAA Airventure Museum]] in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]].
