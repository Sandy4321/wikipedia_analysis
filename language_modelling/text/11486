[[Image:Antarctica-Region.png|thumb|300px|right|The [[Antarctic Convergence]], approximately 200 km south of the [[Polar front|Antarctic Polar Front]], is the [[border]] between two distinct [[region]]s: the '''subantarctic''' and the '''[[antarctic]]'''.]]
The '''Subantarctic''' is a region in the [[Southern Hemisphere|southern hemisphere]], located immediately north of the [[Antarctic]] region. This translates roughly to a [[latitude]] of between 46<U+00B0> - 60<U+00B0> south of the [[equator]]. The subantarctic region includes many [[island]]s in the southern parts of the [[Indian Ocean]], [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Pacific Ocean]], especially those situated north of the [[Antarctic Convergence]]. '''Subantarctic glaciers''' are, by definition, located on islands within the subantarctic region. All [[glacier]]s located on the [[continent]] of [[Antarctica]] are by definition considered to be [[List of glaciers in the Antarctic|antarctic glaciers]].

==History==

==Geography==
The '''subantarctic region''' is comprised of two geographic zones and three distinct [[Weather front|front]]s. The northernmost boundary of the subantarctic region is the rather ill-defined [[Subtropical Front]] ('''STF'''), also referred to as the Subtropical Convergence. To the south of the STF is a geographic zone, the Subantarctic Zone ('''SAZ'''). South of the SAZ is the Subantarctic Front ('''SAF'''). South of the SAF is another marine zone, called the Polar Frontal Zone ('''PFZ'''). The SAZ and the PFZ together form the subantarctic region. The southernmost boundary of the PFZ (and hence, the southern border of the subantarctic region) is the Antarctic Convergence, located approximately 200 kilometers south of the [[Polar front|Antarctic Polar Front]] ('''APF''').<ref name=Smith2008>{{cite web

===Influence of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and thermohaline circulation===
[[Image:Corrientes-oceanicas.gif|350px|thumb|left|Diagram of the major [[ocean current]]s, showing the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] (ACC). In addition to the global [[thermohaline circulation]], the ACC strongly influences regional and global [[climate]].]]
[[Image:Thermohaline Circulation 2.png||350px|thumb|right|Global [[thermohaline circulation]] strongly influences regional and global [[climate]]. Blue paths represent [[Ocean current|deep-water currents]], while red paths represent surface currents.]]
The Subantarctic Front, found between 48<U+00B0>S and 58<U+00B0>S in the Indian and Pacific Ocean and between 42<U+00B0>S and 48<U+00B0>S in the Atlantic Ocean, defines the northern boundary of the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] (or '''ACC''').<ref name=Smith2008/> The ACC is the most important [[ocean current]] in the [[Southern Ocean]], and the only current that flows completely around the Earth. Flowing eastward through the southern portions of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, the ACC links these three otherwise separate [[oceanic basin]]s. Extending from the sea surface to depths of 2000-4000 meters, and with a width of as great as 2000 kilometers, the ACC transports more water than any other ocean current.<ref name=>{{cite book

Another factor that contributes to the climate of the subantarctic region, though to a much lesser extent than the thermohaline circulation, is the formation of [[Antarctic Bottom Water]] ('''ABW''') by [[Halothermal circulation|halothermal dynamics]]. The halothermal circulation is that portion of the global ocean circulation that is driven by global [[Density gradient|density gradients]] created by surface heat and evaporation.

===Definition of subantarctic: political versus scientific===
[[Image:Antarctic_bottom_water_hg.png|thumb|left|Diagram showing different [[water mass]]es in the [[Southern Ocean]].]]
Several distinct [[water mass]]es converge in the immediate vicinity of the APF or Antarctic Convergence (in particular the [[Subantarctic Mode Water|Subantarctic Surface Water]] (Subantarctic Mode Water or '''SAMW'''), [[Antarctic Surface Water]], and the [[Antarctic Intermediate Water]]). This convergence creates a unique environment, noted for its very high [[Primary production|marine productivity]], especially for [[Antarctic krill]]. Because of this, all lands and waters situated south of this point are considered to belong to the Antarctic from a [[climatology|climatological]], [[biology|biological]] and [[hydrology|hydrological]] standpoint.<ref>reference needed</ref> However, the text of the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]], article VI ("Area covered by Treaty") states: "The provisions of the present Treaty shall apply to the area south of [[60th parallel south|60<U+00BA> South latitude]]".<ref name=treaty>{{cite web

===Subantarctic islands===
{{See also|List of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands}}
[[Image:Antarctica Map.png|400px|thumb|right|Antarctica and surrounding islands]]
[[Image:BeagleChannelGlacier.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Trees growing along the north shore of the [[Beagle Channel]], 55<U+00B0>S.]]
[[Tristan da Cunha|Tristan da Cunha group]], [[<U+00CE>le Amsterdam]], [[<U+00CE>le Saint-Paul]], and [[Gough Island]] are all isolated [[High island|volcanic islands]] situated at between 37<U+00B0> - 40<U+00B0> south of the equator, just south of the [[Horse latitudes|southern Horse latitudes]]. Because they are located far to the north of the Antarctic Convergence and have a relatively [[Temperateness|temperate]] climate, they are not typically considered to be subantarctic islands.

At between 46<U+00B0> - 50<U+00B0> south of the equator, in the region often referred to as the ''[[Roaring Forties]]'', are the [[Crozet Islands]], [[Prince Edward Islands]], [[Bounty Islands]], [[Snares Islands]], [[Kerguelen Islands]], [[Antipodes Islands]], and [[Auckland Islands]]. These islands, all located approximately on the Antarctic Convergence (roughly the northern boundary of the subantarctic region), are properly considered to be subantarctic islands.

At between 51<U+00B0> - 56<U+00B0> south of the equator, the [[Falkland Islands]], [[Isla de los Estados]], [[Ildefonso Islands]], [[Diego Ram<U+00ED>rez Islands]], and other islands associated with [[Tierra del Fuego]] and [[Cape Horn]], lie north of the Antarctic Convergence in the region often referred to as the ''[[Furious Fifties]]''. Unlike other subantarctic islands, these islands have [[Tree line|trees]], [[Amsterdam and Saint-Paul Islands temperate grasslands|temperate grasslands]] (mostly ''[[Poa flabellata|tussac grass]]''), and even [[arable land]]. They also lack [[tundra]] and [[Snow line|permanent snow]] and ice at their lowest elevations. Despite their more southerly location, it is debatable whether these islands should be considered as such because their climate and geography differs significantly from other subantarctic islands.

At between 52<U+00B0> - 57<U+00B0> south of the equator, [[Campbell Island group]], [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]], [[Bouvet Island]], [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia Group]], [[Macquarie Island]], and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Sandwich Islands]] are also located in the Furious Fifties. The geography of these islands is characterized by tundra, [[permafrost]], and [[volcano]]es. These islands are situated south of the Antarctic Convergence, but north of the [[60th parallel south|60<U+00B0> latitude]] (the continental limit according to the Antarctic Treaty).<ref name=treaty/> Therefore despite their being located south of the Antarctic Convergence, they should still be considered to be subantarctic islands by virtue of their location north of the 60<U+00B0> latitude.

At between 60<U+00B0> - 69<U+00B0> south of the equator, the [[South Orkney Islands]], [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Balleny Islands]], [[Scott Island]], and [[Peter I Island]] are all properly considered to be antarctic islands for the following three reasons:
#they are all located south of the Antarctic Convergence
#they are all located within the Southern (or Antarctic) Ocean
#they are all located south of the 60<U+00B0> latitude (in the region often referred to as the ''[[Shrieking Sixties]]'')

In light of the above considerations, the following should be considered to be [[List of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands|subantarctic islands]]:

==Climate==
===Impact of climate change on SAMW===
Together, the Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) act as a [[carbon sink]], absorbing [[atmospheric carbon dioxide]] and storing it in solution. If the SAMW temperature increases as a result of [[climate change]], the SAMW will have less capacity to store dissolved carbon dioxide. Research using a computerized climate system model suggests that if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration were to increase to 860 ppm by the year 2100 (roughly double today's concentration), the SAMW will decrease in density and salinity. The resulting reductions in the subduction and transport capacity of SAMW and AAIW water masses could potentially decrease the absorption and storage of CO2 in the Southern Ocean.<ref name=down2009>{{cite journal

Bearing this in mind, it should come as no surprise that many subantarctic glaciers are also in retreat. [[Glacier mass balance|Mass balance]] is significantly negative on many glaciers on Kergeulen Island, Heard Island, South Georgia and Bouvet Island. In 1947, Heard Island's glaciers covered 288 km2 or 79 percent of the island. By 1988 this had decreased by 11 percent to 257 km2. By 2000, the Stephenson, Brown and Baudissin glaciers had retreated even further.<ref name=Ruddell>{{cite web

The island's steep topography means that glaciers are relatively thin - about 55m deep on average. The largest glacier, Gotley, originating on the island's highest point, Mawson Peak (2745 m) is 27 km2 in area and 13.2 km long. Smaller glaciers such as Nares, Mary Powell, Brown, Deacock and those on the [[Laurens Peninsula]] have significantly receded, but the larger glaciers such as Gotley, Abbotsmith, Downes and Ealey show little or no change since 1947.<ref name=Ruddell></ref>

Heard Island is cold and steep with a high snowfall. Many larger glaciers are unable to lose much ice in the narrow coastal melt zone. If this zone were wider some of these glaciers would be several kilometers longer, but instead the sea's action removes ice from glacier tongues. For such glaciers, up to 80 percent of their volume loss is through calving. Loss through melting is unlikely to be considerable even if conditions were significantly warmer.<ref name=Ruddell></ref>

The smaller, shorter glaciers are much more sensitive to temperature effects. Laurens Peninsula glaciers, whose maximum elevation is only 500m above sea level, are particularly vulnerable. With a warming of 1<U+00B0>C the accumulation zone above the end-of-summer snowline elevation of about 300m would recede to about 450m elevation due to rain and increased melt. With an accumulation zone reduced to a range of only 50m elevation, the glacier retreats until the elevation range of the melt zone is similar in size.
This illustrates much of what has been happening for Laurens Peninsula glaciers since 1947, during which time their total area has decreased by over 30 percent. Jacka Glacier in the early 1950s had receded only slightly from its position in the late 1920s, but by 1997 it had receded about 700m back from the coastline.<ref name=Ruddell></ref><ref name=Allis1986>{{cite journal
