"'''Miles Away'''" is a song by [[United States|American]] singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] from her eleventh studio album, ''[[Hard Candy (Madonna album)|Hard Candy]]''. It was first released as a promotional single in Japan in June 2008, as the theme for the [[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]] Japanese drama ''[[Change (TV series)|Change]]''.<ref name=TheHollywoodReporter>{{cite news |first=Julian |last=Ryall|title=Madonna song used for Japanese TV drama |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/musicNews/idUSN2429776420080324 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]]|date=March 24, 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-21 }}</ref> The song was released by [[Warner Bros. Records]] as the third and final single from the album on October 17, 2008. "Miles Away" is a melancholy electronic ballad, written by Madonna, [[Justin Timberlake]] and [[Timbaland]] and is inspired by Madonna's then husband [[Guy Ritchie]]. Lyrically the song deals with [[long distance relationship]]s.

"Miles Away" has been critically appreciated for being a harmonious ballad speaking of true feelings. The song is considered one of the finer moments from ''Hard Candy'' and has been compared to Justin Timberlake's 2006 single "[[What Goes Around.../...Comes Around]]". "Miles Away" reached the top forty in most countries including the United Kingdom, Canada, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The song did not appear on the official charts of Australia and United States. However in the United States, the song was a success on the dance charts, where it became Madonna's seventh consecutive number one song on the [[Hot Dance Airplay]] chart, the most for an artist. The song has been performed by Madonna in the ''Hard Candy'' Promo Tour and the [[Sticky & Sweet Tour]] during the [[gypsy]] segment of the show.

==Writing and inspiration==

The music for "Miles Away" was the first song of ''[[Hard Candy (Madonna album)|Hard Candy]]'' to be composed. After hearing it, Madonna began singing and writing the lyrics for the song.<ref name=SunMedia>{{cite web |last = Stevenson|first = Jane |title = The JAM!

[[File:Milesawaysheet.JPG|250px|right|thumb|"Miles Away" sheet music showing the chord progression and the beat rate.]]
<blockquote>Probably in many respects most of the songs [on ''Hard Candy''] are [autobiographical]. But in more of an unconscious way. I don't really think about telling personal stories when I'm writing music. It just comes. And then a lot of times, six months later, eight months later, I go, "Oh, that's what I wrote that song about." But that's when I play the song for lots of people and they all go, "Oh, I can totally relate to that." In 'Miles Away' I'm tapping into the global consciousness of people who have intimacy problems.<ref name=Interview>{{cite web | last = Sischy | first = Ingrid | title = Madonna: the one and only, on her life unchained | work = [[Interview (magazine)|Interview magazine]] | publisher = [[CNET Networks]], Inc. | date = April 2008 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_3_38/ai_n24945443/pg_6 | accessdate = 2008-08-21 }}</ref></blockquote>

In an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' Madonna further explained her inspiration behind the song and stated,

<blockquote>That's a song most people who work can relate to. If part of your work is travelling, and the person you are with also works and travels, you find yourself separated a lot and it can be very frustrating, [...] I'm American and he [Guy Ritchie] is British, and I have to come to America all the time. [...] Especially at the beginning of our relationship, that long-distance thing was very frustrating. I also think it's easier for people to say things from a distance; it's safer.<ref name="teleaus">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23565902-5009160,00.html|title=Madonna shows her soft side|last=Moran|first=Jonathan|date=April 20, 2008|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph, Australia]]|publisher=www.news.com.au|accessdate=2009-04-22}}</ref></blockquote>
