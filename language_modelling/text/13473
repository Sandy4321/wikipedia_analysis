'''''Hell Awaits''''' is the second [[studio album]] by the American [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]], released through [[Metal Blade Records]] in 1985. The band's previous release, ''[[Show No Mercy (Slayer album)|Show No Mercy]]'', became Metal Blade Records' highest selling release; as a result, producer [[Brian Slagel]] desired to release a second Slayer album. To that end, Slagel financed a recording budget (''Show No Mercy'' was paid for by band members) and recruited several experienced producers to help in the studio.

Lyrical themes on ''Hell Awaits'' are darker than on ''Show No Mercy'', and included [[hell]] and [[Satan]]. The intro of the first track "Hell Awaits" played backwards reveals the repeated phrase "join us".<ref name="Slayer - Tom Araya - January 2007">{{cite web

==Recording==
Slayer's previous album, ''[[Show No Mercy (Slayer album)|Show No Mercy]]'', became [[Metal Blade Records]]' highest selling release, selling 40,000 copies worldwide; the success inspired producer Brian Slagel to want another record from the band.<ref name="INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN SLAGEL">{{cite web|title = Interview with Brian Slagel|author = German, Eric|publisher = Metalupdate.com|url = http://www.metalupdate.com/interviewmetalblade.html|accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref> Slagel hired producer [[Ron Fair]], who worked for [[Chrysalis Records]], and had seen the band perform live and enjoyed their performance. On seeing Slayer in the studio, Fair stated, "Wow, these guys are really angry," as he was inexperienced working with heavy metal musicians.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> Slagel financed the album, in stark contrast to ''Show No Mercy'', which was financed by singer [[Tom Araya]], who used his earnings as a [[respiratory therapist]], and a loan from guitarist [[Kerry King]]'s father.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>

The budget organized by Slagel allowed for professional assistance. Bernie Grundman provided [[audio mastering]], Eddy Schreyer worked on [[Audio mastering|remastering]], and Bill Metoyer, who worked on the band's earlier release ''[[Haunting the Chapel]]'', acted as [[sound engineer]].<ref name="Hell Awaits credits">{{cite web |title=Hell Awaits credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r18219|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref> The recording featured audio effects such as the intro to "Hell Awaits," a reversed recording of a demonic-sounding voice repeating "Join us," ending with "Welcome back."<ref name="Why They Rule - #6 Slayer">{{cite web|title=Why They Rule - #6 Slayer|publisher=[[MTV]]|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/metal/greatest_metal_bands/071406/index7.jhtml|accessdate =2006-01-18}}</ref> Still, Araya later stated the album had poor production quality: "Nowadays, production-wise, it's so under par. But for what it was at the time, those are amazing records to me. I guess we could go in and redo it. But why ruin it?"<ref name="Slay Ride">{{cite web|title=Slay Ride|author=La Briola, John|publisher=Westword.com|date=2004-07-22

Drummer [[Dave Lombardo]], on the other hand, asserts the album was professionally done compared to ''Show No Mercy'': "I didn<U+2019>t have to overdub the [[cymbal]]s, and we had a really good engineer."<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> Lombardo's favorite song is "At Dawn They Sleep," "because it was kind of slow and grungy, but then it had that [[double bass drum|double-bass]] part at the end."<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> While recording the track, neither guitarists King or [[Jeff Hanneman]] who wrote the lyrics were in the studio<U+2014>only Araya and Slagel. On reading the lyrics, which featured a misspelled word, Araya sang it as it was spelled, although it's not a real word.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>

==Touring==
To promote ''Hell Awaits'', Slayer embarked on the Combat Tour with [[Venom (band)|Venom]] and [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]]. Exodus guitarist [[Gary Holt (musician)|Gary Holt]] commented, "We immediately bonded with the Slayer guys. It was two bands of friends playing with one band of heroes, you know? We were just star-struck."<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>

Inside Venom's tour bus (the first time Slayer had been in one) the band members got [[drunk]] with Venom, while listening to ''Hell Awaits''.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer">{{cite web|title=An exclusive oral history of Slayer|publisher=Decibel Magazine|url=http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features_detail.aspx?id=4566|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060813155123/http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features_detail.aspx?id=4566|archivedate=2006-08-13|accessdate=2006-12-03}}</ref> Araya entered the bus "hammered out of his mind," according to Lombardo, saying "I gotta take a piss! Where<U+2019>s the bathroom in this thing?"<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> Venom singer [[Conrad Lant|Conrad "Cronos" Lant]] responded, saying "Right here<U+2014>right here in my mouth!" Araya took him literally and urinated on his hair. Cronos got up and punched him in the face, the two blamed each other all night, and Araya continued the tour with a [[black eye]].<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> Araya won't discuss the incident other than saying that he was drunk and it was a very disrespectful thing to do.<ref name=A Folk Devil Talking: Slayer's Tom Araya Interviewed">{{cite web|title=A Folk Devil Talking: Slayer's Tom Araya Interviewed|publisher=The Quietus|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/07993-slayer-tom-araya-interview|accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref>

Although it did not enter any charts, ''Hell Awaits'' was hailed upon its release as Slayer's most progressive recording, featuring much darker thrash-oriented style, with unusual arrangements such as varying tempos, and dissonant nuances that "paved the way to a wholly distinctive sound all their own," according to [[AllMusic]] reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia.<ref name="Hell Awaits"/> Rivadavia awarded the album four out of five stars, calling it an "irresistible force, but one could still make a confident point that ''Hell Awaits''' uniquely daunting compositions arguably proved just as influential to future extreme metal acts."It has sold over 1.000.000 records worldwide according to Brian Slagel.<ref name="Hell Awaits">{{cite web |title=Hell Awaits |author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |work=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[Macrovision]] |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r18219|pure_url=yes}}

The sludgy riffs, which were pure [Black] [[Black Sabbath|Sabbath]], are offset by some of King's and Hanneman's faster solos, giving Slayer entr<U+00E9>e into the [[speed metal]] realm."<ref name="Lengends of Rock Guitar" />
