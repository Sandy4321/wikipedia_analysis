The '''Coachella Valley''' ({{pron-en|ko<U+028A>.<U+0259><U+02C8>t<U+0283><U+025B>l<U+0259>}}) is a large valley [[landform]] in [[Southern California]] that is populated by nearly one million people, which includes the famed tourist destination, [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], this valley is part of the 14th largest metropolitan area in the United States, the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]]. Geographically it is the agricultural and recreational [[desert]] valley in Southern California, United States (U.S.), east of [[Riverside, California|Riverside]] and [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]]. The Coachella Valley is the second largest sub-region in the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire Metropolitan Area]] only after the [[Greater San Bernardino Area]]. The valley extends for approximately 45 miles (72&nbsp;km) in [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]] southeast from the [[San Bernardino Mountains]] to the saltwater [[Salton Sea]], the largest lake in California. It is approximately 15 miles (24&nbsp;km) wide along most of its length, bounded on the west by the [[San Jacinto Mountains]] and the [[Santa Rosa Mountains (California)|Santa Rosa Mountains]] and on the north and east by the [[Little San Bernardino Mountains]]. The [[San Andreas Fault]] crosses the valley from the [[Chocolate Mountains]] in the southeast corner and along the centerline of the Little San Bernardinos. The fault is easily visible along its northern length as a strip of greenery against an otherwise bare mountain. The Chocolate Mountains are home to a [[United States Navy]] live gunnery range and are mostly off-limits to the public. In comparison to the "[[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]]" (Riverside-San Bernardino area and the California desert), some people refer to the IE 's sub-region Coachella Valley as the "Desert Empire" to demenstrate the one whole metropolitan area. [[Geography|Geographers]] and [[geologist]]s sometimes call the area, along with the [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial Valley]] to the south, the "Cahuilla Basin" or the "Salton Trough."<ref>[http://ca.water.usgs.gov/groundwater/gwatlas/basin/terminal.html USGS - Salton Trough]</ref>

==Communities and population==
The Coachella Valley contains nine cities and various unincorporated communities.

The Coachella Valley is one of the fastest-growing areas in the country, due in part to its location in Riverside County, California, and to real estate booms in the 1990s. The area, made of nine incorporated cities, has a total population of over 400,000, twice the number of 1990 (185,000) and three times than in 1980 (80,000). State projections estimate that the valley's population will pass 600,000 by the year 2020 and 1.1 million by 2066.<ref>[http://www.cvep.com/pop_trends.shtml Coachella Valley Economic Partnership - Population Trends]</ref>

The popular resort community of [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] sits at the northwest end of the valley. Unincorporated areas and towns include [[Bermuda Dunes, California|Bermuda Dunes]] and [[Thousand Palms, California|Thousand Palms]] in the west end of the valley with [[Indio Hills, California|Indio Hills]], [[Sky Valley, California|Sky Valley]], [[North Palm Springs, California|North Palm Springs]] and [[Garnet, California|Garnet]] along the northern rim along with [[Thermal, California|Thermal]], [[Valerie Jean, California|Valerie Jean]], [[Vista Santa Rosa, California|Vista Santa Rosa]], [[Oasis, Riverside County, California|Oasis]] and [[Mecca, California|Mecca]] to the southeast. The native [[Cahuilla]] tribe represented in the [[Cabazon Band of Mission Indians]], [[Twentynine Palms Band of Mission Indians]], [[Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians]] and the [[Torres-Martinez Band of Cahuilla Indians]] each have reservations in the area. 

A retirement haven throughout the area's history, senior citizens and the wealthy came to live in the Coachella Valley and a large percentage of residents are age 65 or older. 

Though the area is somewhat politically conservative, it is nevertheless renowned for being a community that is known for its inclusion of [[gay]]s and [[lesbians]] as part of a diverse community.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} Current estimates are that up to 33% of Palm Springs' residents identify as gay and lesbian.<ref name="The Body">[http://www.thebody.com/african_american/movers/roden.html The Body: African-American HIV/AIDS Resource Center: Interview with Ron Oden]</ref> Cathedral City is also home to a number of gay resorts, bars, restaurants and clubs. Many establishments along a stretch of Arenas Road in downtown Palm Springs are gay-oriented and serve as the center of the annual [[White Party]]. According to an interview with former Palm Springs mayor [[Ron Oden]], perhaps the nation's only openly gay African-American mayor,<ref name="The Body" /> A large number of HIV/AIDS-infected individuals have moved to Palm Springs to take advantage of the extensive health-support systems that have been developed in recent years (such as the Desert AIDS Project.)  For this reason, Palm Springs has one of the highest per capita rates of HIV/AIDS in the nation. 

The area has a large percentage of [[Mexican American]] political figures, plus the state assembly representative [[Bonnie Garcia]] of La Quinta is of [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] parentage.

===Racial/ethnic diversity===
{{Citations missing|date=June 2007}}
The Coachella Valley was settled by a diverse array of races and ethnicities. Once viewed as predominantly Caucasian, the Coachella Valley has features of a diverse history. As of 2004, the Claritas study<ref>[http://cvep.com/race_composition.shtml Coachella Valley Economic Partnership - Racial Composition]</ref> found that 373,100 people resided in the region. The racial makeup was 44.70% Non-Hispanic White, 49.90% Hispanic, 1.80% Black/African American, 2.10% Asian/Pacific Islander, 0.40% American Indian and Eskimo, 0.10% from other races, and 1.10% from two or more races.

In the early 20th century, less than 1,000 full-time residents from across the U.S. lived in the "village" (Palm Springs), surrounding farms and ranches, and on the Indian reservation. The [[United States Census, 1930|1930 U.S. census]] found less than half the Coachella Valley's population was "white", the rest were [[Mexican people|Mexicans]] especially in the eastern ends when [[traquero]]s arrived to maintain the area's railroads, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of local tribes in what was then impoverished reservations. 

Starting in the 1890s, there has been a large [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] presence in the region, after Palm Springs was an established agricultural colony called "Palm Valley" cofounded by Welwood Murray, a Scottish immigrant and John Guthrie McCallum, an American from the U.S. East coast. The two men widely advertised the colony to settlers in an interest of a warm climate and the ideal winter residence.<ref>Facts and Legends: The Village of Palm Springs, Sally Presley, (1986, fourth printing 2002)</ref> It might explain the high percentage of East Coast Americans (New Englanders), Canadians, and British citizens in Palm Springs during the early 1900s.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

The area's population growth included members of several immigrant communities including [[Italian people|Italians]] and [[Poles]] after World War II, mostly settling in a section known as "Little Tuscany" in Palm Springs. Soon, [[German people|Germans]], [[French people|French]] and [[Scandinavia]]ns made up a segment of residents. Today, affluent tourists from Canada, Europe and Australia frequently visit and some decidedly relocated in the area. Britons are increasingly coming to Palm Springs and desert cities, for vacations or often to retire. 

The Coachella Valley has a [[Jew]]ish community, and according to the [[United Jewish Citizens of the Desert]], the Coachella Valley has an estimated 20,000 [[American Jews]], one of California's largest Jewish communities. But all faiths and denominations are found and represented in the area, the largest church being [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. There is also a sizable [[Mormon]] community, settling here since the early 1900s, with three branches of the [[Latter Day Saint]]s church.

[[Hispanics]] are long established in Palm Springs' central and eastern sections, and have constituted the majority of the populations of [[Indio, California|Indio]] and [[Coachella, California|Coachella]] for many decades. In the 2000 U.S. census, about 35 percent of Coachella Valley residents were Latino. But according to the [[United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce]], an estimated half (50&ndash;60 percent) of the percentage of residents are Latino.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

Most of the valley's Latinos are Mexican or [[Mexican American]] from a multi-generational community (see [[Chicano]]), but [[Central America]]n immigrants (especially in Indio and Cathedral City), [[Cuban American]]s, [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Ricans]], and South Americans are also prevalent (esp. in Rancho Mirage and Palm Desert). The two-decade-old trend of immigration from neighboring Mexico has culturally impacted the Coachella Valley in many more ways than the rest of California or the country.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} 

Most Latinos came to obtain work in the area's year-round [[agriculture]], but today many find employment in [[construction]] and home remodeling, the resort [[hospitality]] industry, [[landscaping]] firms, and in the [[retail]] sector. According to a 2006 real estate report by the Coachella Valley Association of Realtors, about 3 out of 5 new homeowners are Latino, and the majority of them are middle class, raising families in two-income households, and came from urban centers of [[Southern California]] around Los Angeles and San Diego.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The prominence of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the [[Cahuilla]] tribe is represented in local life; because of [[casino]] gambling and land ownership, the majority of local tribal members (Cahullas pertained to the Agua Caliente band and the Cabazon/Twentynine Palms bands) are in upper-income brackets. According to the Southern California [[National Congress of American Indians]], less than 5 percent of the area's residents are Native Americans.

[[African American]]s are concentrated in Palm Springs' northern and eastern ends, as well in small sections of Indio and Desert Hot Springs, but local blacks live everywhere in middle-class and wealthy areas, blacks are less than 5 percent of the local population. The area is home to 10,000 [[Indian American]]s (mostly from [[Sri Lanka]]), descendants of agricultural workers in the 1930s and 1940s (another large community is Imperial Valley to the south). Additionally, Palm Desert is the home of 1,000 [[Tahiti]]ans, a [[Pacific Islander]] people from [[French Polynesia]].

Other ethnic groups in the area like [[Asian Americans]] (i.e. [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and [[Filipino people|Filipinos]]), followed by a small wave of [[Armenians]] and [[Arab people|Arabs]] (esp. [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] and [[Syrian people|Syrians]]) from the Middle East were involved in the area's agriculture in the early 1900s. In recent years, the area (especially Palm Desert and Palm Springs) became popular to [[Persians|Iranian]], [[Israeli people|Israeli]], [[East Indians|East Indian]], and [[Koreans|Korean]] home buyers, with most purchasing increasingly high-valued properties for investment purposes.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

In mid-2000, Palm Springs city officials and business leaders discussed on an unofficial declaration of Palm Springs as a "hate-free zone" as a sign of local pride to celebrate the city's [[tolerance]] (Palm Springs, especially in [[the Advocate]] magazine that caters to gay and lesbian readership, has voted it as one of the top five most popular world places for the gay/lesbian lifestyle) {{Fact|date=February 2007}} and multicultural [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] of the city's relaxed attitude regarding many races living close together.

==Geography and climate==
{{wide image|Joshua tree keys view pano more vertical.jpg|1000px|Panorama of the view south from Keys View in the [[Little San Bernardino Mountains]], [[Joshua Tree National Park]], California, USA. Visible landmarks are the [[Salton Sea]] (230ft below sea level) at rear left, along towards the center the [[Santa Rosa Mountains]] behind [[Indio, California|Indio]] and the [[San Jacinto Mountains]] behind [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]]. In the valley floor, the [[San Andreas Fault]] is clearly visible. At the rear right is the {{convert|11500|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[San Gorgonio Mountain]]}}
The area is surrounded on the southwest by the [[Santa Rosa Mountains (California)|Santa Rosa]] and [[San Jacinto Mountains|San Jacinto]] mountain ranges, and the [[Little San Bernardino Mountains]] on the northeast. These mountains peak at around {{convert|11000|ft|m}} and tend to average between three to five thousand feet. This effectively blocks the [[marine layer]] familiar to most other Southern Californian areas. Sometimes a weather system can come through one of the narrow passes, or up from the [[Gulf of California]] as [[Hurricane Kathleen (1976)|Hurricane Kathleen]] did in September 1976. Daily high temperatures in the summer rarely go lower than 105 <U+00B0>F.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} During winter, the daytime temperatures range from {{convert|70|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|abbr=on}} to {{convert|80|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|abbr=on}}, making it a popular winter resort destination.

Although geographically the valley is the northwestern extension of the [[Colorado Desert]] to the southeast, the irrigation of over 100,000 acres (405&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of the valley since the early 20th century has allowed widespread agriculture. In its 2006 annual report, the Coachella Valley Water District listed the year's total crop value at over $576 million or almost $12,000 per acre.<ref>[http://www.cvwd.org/news/publicinfo/2006_annual_water_quality_report.pdf Coachella Valley Water District - 2005&ndash;06 Annual Review & Water Quality Report]</ref> The [[Coachella Canal]], a concrete-lined aqueduct built between 1938 and 1948 as a branch of the [[All-American Canal]], brings water from the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] to the valley. The [[Colorado River Aqueduct]], which provides drinking water to Los Angeles and [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], crosses the northeast end of the valley along the base of the Little San Bernardino Mountains (the [[Joshua Tree National Park]]).

The [[San Andreas Fault]] runs down the Valley's east side. Because of this fault the Valley has many hot springs. The Santa Rosa Mountains to the West are part of the Lake Elsinore Fault zone. The Results of a prehistoric [[sturzstrom]] can be seen in Martinez Canyon. The Painted Canyons of Mecca feature smaller faults as well as Precambrian, Tertiary and Quaternary rock formations, unconformities, badlands and desert landforms. Seismic activity is what triggers [[earthquake]]s, a common natural but on occasion, destructive phenomena in the Coachella Valley, and fault lines causes hot water springs or geysers to rise from the ground. Earthquakes and natural water sources are what brought possible inhabitation and development in a desert like the Coachella Valley. There has been major earthquake that have affected the Coachella Valley for instance the Landers Earthquake in 1992 caused some damage in the valley. Probably the one that has affected the valley the most was the 1986 North Palm Springs earthquake which registered at a magnitude of 6.0 and caused substanial damage and the destruction of 51 homes and injured 29 people.[http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/events/1986_07_08.php][http://www.data.scec.org/chrono_index/npalmspr.html]

==Ecology==
This desert environment hosts a variety of flora and fauna, including the [[endangered]] [[California Fan Palm]], ''[[Washingtonia filifera]]''.<ref>C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=90942 ''California Fan Palm: Washingtonia filifera'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. Nicklas Stromberg]</ref>

==Agriculture==
===Fruit===
The valley is the primary [[date (fruit)|date]]-growing region in the United States, responsible for nearly 95 percent of the nation's crop and is celebrated each year in Indio during the Riverside [[county fair|County Fair]] and National Date Festival. The earliest attempt at growing dates came about in 1890 when the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) imported date palm shoots from [[Iraq]] and [[Egypt]]. Sixty-eight shoots were distributed across the Southwest U.S. in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]], [[Yuma, Arizona]], [[Phoenix, Arizona]], and several California cites: Indio, [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] near Los Angeles, [[Tulare, California|Tulare]] and [[National City, California|National City]] near [[San Diego]]. The imports were almost all male seedlings and produced poor fruit. The Coachella Valley showed promise, so USDA horticulturist Bernard Johnson planted a number of shoots that he brought back from [[Algeria]] in September 1903. On his own initiative, Johnson imported more shoots from Algeria in 1908 and again in 1912. The area's entire date industry can be traced back to those original USDA experiments near present-day Mecca. Date groves were grown from present-day [[Cathedral City, California|Cathedral City]] to the Salton Sea, but most date groves are replaced by development by the 1990s. Today, nearly all the date groves are in the "East Valley" area south of Indio, near Coachella and east of La Quinta.

Other agricultural products cultivated in the Coachella valley include fruits and vegetables, especially table grapes, citrus fruits and peppers along with avocados, artichokes, beans, carrots, corn, cotton, grains (barley, oats and wheat plus rice fields kept wet or moist in the Salton Sea area), lettuce, peaches, persimmons, plums and prunes, spinach, strawberries, mangoes, tomatoes and other vegetable crops. The Coachella grapefruit originated in the region. The city of [[Coachella, California|Coachella]] is the primary shipping point for agricultural goods. Agriculture is a founding block of the majority of "oldtimer" residents (In the 2000 census, only 10 percent of the Coachella Valley residents are born/raised in the area, a much lower percentage than most parts of the U.S.), whose parents and grandparents came to the area as farmers and laborers transformed the eastern parts of the valley, from a hot sandy desert into a green fertile place with a year-round growing season. The Coachella and Imperial valley's agricultural miracle is in due part to irrigation, an underground aquifer from the era when the valley was under a fresh water lake in the last [[ice age]] (over 10,000 years ago), and the All-American Canal completed in the late 1940s brought large supplies of water from the Colorado River. Recent growth of fish farming or "[[aquaculture]]" in Mecca near the Salton Sea brings new promise to the local economy, especially in efforts to restore the ailing ecology of the large saltwater lake.

===Wind farming===
{{wide image|San gorgonio pass wind farm california pano.jpg|800px|The [[San Gorgonio Pass Wind Farm]] as viewed from the top of the [[Palm Springs Aerial Tramway]] in the [[San Jacinto Mountains]] to the south.}}
The valley's northwest entrance from the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]] along [[Interstate 10 (California)|Interstate 10]] is known as the [[San Gorgonio Pass]] and is one of the windiest places on earth. Cool coastal air is forced through the pass and mixes with the hot desert air, making the San Gorgonio Pass one of only three ideal places in California for steady, wind-generated electricity. At the [[San Gorgonio Pass Wind Farm]], hundreds of huge wind turbines spread across the desert and hills on either side of the highway greet visitors as they approach the crest of the pass and have become somewhat of a symbol of the area. The state's other wind farms are in the [[Tehachapi Pass]] between [[Mojave, California|Mojave]] and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and in the [[Altamont Pass]] near [[Livermore, California|Livermore]].

==History==
There is some contention as to the origin of the name. Early maps show the area as ''"Conchella,"'' the Spanish word for "seashell." Since the area was once a part of a vast inland sea, tiny fossilized mollusk shells can be found in just about every remote area. Local lore explains the change in the name from Conchella to Coachella as a mistake made by the map-makers contracted to transcribe the data supplied by the Southern Pacific Railroad's survey party.  Rather than redraw the expensive maps, the railroad chose to instead begin calling the area by the misspelled name "Coachella" rather than its traditional name "Conchella."  Some believe that the name Coachella was simply made up, but that theory is rather unlikely. Even though the area had been surveyed by [[Edward Fitzgerald Beale]] in 1857, whose survey party actually used [[camels]] to cross the desert, primarily along the path of the historic [[Bradshaw Trail]], it wasn't until the coming of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] and the discovery of abundant [[artesian]] wells later in the 19th Century that the area began to expand. Cindarella Courtney was the first non-Indian child born in Indio in 1898. The first boy, David Elgin, was born in 1899. 

The coming in 1926 of [[U.S. Route 99 (California)|U.S. Route 99]] northward through Coachella and Indio and westward toward [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] more or less along the present route of [[Interstate 10 (California)|Interstate 10]] helped further open both agriculture, commerce and tourism to the rest of the country. So too did the coming of [[California State Route 111|State Highway 111]] in the early 1930s, which cut a diagonal swath through the valley and connected all of its major settlements. Dr. [[June McCarroll]], then a nurse with the Southern Pacific whose office fronted U.S. 99 in Indio, is credited with being the first person to delineate a divided highway by painting a stripe down the middle of the roadbed in response to frequent head-on collisions. The standard was refined and adopted worldwide. Doctor McCarroll is memorialized by a stretch of I-10 through Indio named in her honor.

The Coachella Valley became a major real estate destination in the 1980s and 1990s no longer limited to senior citizens, winter residents and retirees. Families with young children and young adults became interested in Palm Springs and surrounding communities for lower cost housing and apartment rents. The tourist attraction we know as Palm Springs has been exported worldwide, an increase of international visitors and now treated as a "year-round" community, the Coachella Valley is sometimes compared to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], [[Phoenix, Arizona]] or [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] as part of the Southwest, as much it's a part of [[Southern California]]'s most popular destinations ([[San Diego]], [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]). In a 2003 ''[[Cond<U+00E9> Nast]]'' publication review, Palm Springs was ranked one of the top 10 global vacation destinations, and the smallest one in population.

==Recreation and annual activities==

With more than 350 days of sunshine per year and warm, mild winters&mdash;though summer can be quite hot&mdash;recreational hiking and horseback riding are popular in the many [[canyons]] in the mountains that surround the valley. One of the most visited outdoor sports areas is Thousand Palms Canyon.

The Coachella Valley was once a safe haven for [[hay fever]] [[allergy]] sufferers before the surge of golf courses and year-round lawns, and people with [[bronchitis]], [[emphysema]] and [[asthma]] chose to relocate for health reasons in the early half of the 20th century.

In the early 1900s, Palm Springs was an ideal farming town and had some space converted to a minor agricultural economy. After that failed, all the fields and groves were replaced by homes and golf courses. Agriculture succeeded in the lower Coachella Valley near the communities of Thermal, Mecca, Oasis and Vista Santa Rosa that had a large underground aquifer to sustain a year-round green environment.

More than two hundred golf courses blanket the area, making it one of the world's premier golf destinations. The [[Merrill Lynch]] [[Skins Game]] is held in La Quinta each [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and draws some of the biggest names in golf. The [[Professional Golfers Association|PGA]] has a major presence in La Quinta as well with the PGA WEST golf and residential complex. One of the host courses of the aforementioned Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, a PGA WEST fairway represents the area in [[Soarin' Over California]], an [[IMAX]]-based attraction at [[Disney's California Adventure]] theme park. 

The area is also dotted with classy, [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]-style casinos run by local Indian tribes as well as resort hotels and spas with natural [[mineral water]] wells, making it a prime vacation destination as well. The [[Palm Springs Aerial Tramway]], considered to be one of the greatest engineering feats of the 20th Century, takes visitors from the valley floor to the [[San Jacinto Peak]] mountain station 8516 feet (2595 m) above sea level.

Palm Springs is home to one of the country's largest collections of mid-century architecture. Thousands of homes, apartments, hotels, businesses and other buildings were designed in this fashion across the city. International mid-century enthusiasts come to Palm Springs to admire the design. 

Other activities include:

*An annual air show is held in November is held at the [[Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport]] in Thermal. The [[Palm Springs Airport Annual Air Show]] held every January displays World War II-era vintage fighter aircraft.

*In recent years, the area has become a mecca for fans of [[alternative music]]. The Empire Polo Club in Indio hosts the outdoor [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] each April, drawing thousands of alternative music fans from across the country.

*[[The Desert Circuit Horse Show]] is one of the nation's largest horse competitions is also held at the Polo Grounds from January through March, as well as polo matches by such celebrities as [[Prince Charles]] of England. 

*The Coachella Valley attempted to draw in sports teams, both minor league and semi-pro but met with limited success. In the 1990s, Palm Desert city officials approved a sports arena, but the project never broke ground.  In 2006, Indio city officials approved an U.S. Olympic team training facility to be completed by 2009. 

*The [[Palm Springs Power]] minor league [[baseball]] team plays in [[Palm Springs Stadium]] every summer and the [[Palm Springs Chill]] is a team of the [[Arizona Winter Baseball League]] plays in January and February both in Palm Springs Stadium, the former site of the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]] major league spring training facility from 1961 to 1993. Collegiate sports are played at [[College of the Desert]] at its Palm Desert campus.

*The recently expanded [[Palm Springs Convention Center]] is a major venue for shows, concerts, auctions, expos and exhibits. In the past, it played host to exhibition basketball, [[roller hockey]] games, [[ice skating]] events and indoor sports played there.  

* The [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] held its first outdoor exhibition basketball game at the [[Indian Wells Tennis Garden]] of Indian Wells on 11 October 2008 That stadium facility was built primarily for tennis tournaments and music concerts, and it can hold up to 15,000 fans. The two basketball teams playing there were the [[Phoenix Suns]] and the [[Denver Nuggets]] - despite some past interest by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] playing there. {{Fact|date=March 2008}}

*Auto racing will make a comeback in Palm Springs in October 2008 when the revived [[Palm Springs Grand Prix]] takes place on a closed two-mile (3&nbsp;km) track on selected city streets. Palm Springs hosted a vintage car race from 1988 to 2002, and twice it attempted to have a speedway constructed in the early 1990s. This was never approved by the city and county commissions. 

===Celebrity residents===

The area has been a magnet for [[Hollywood]] stars since the 1930s when [[Bing Crosby]], [[Charles Farrell]] and [[Ralph Bellamy]] founded the area's first tennis club in Palm Springs. Crosby would go on to found the Blue Skies Trailer Park in Rancho Mirage, unique for its expensive trailer homes each with its own individual theme. Other 1930s/1940s celebrities known to stop by Palm Springs included [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[John Barrymore]], [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]], [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Judy Garland]].

Farrell, after whom a street in Palm Springs is named, would later be elected mayor. Farrell Drive is built on the path of the [[Palmdale Railroad]], a narrow-gauge horse-drawn railroad [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] originally built to serve the proposed town of Palmdale. The town was never built and the railroad was abandoned after a few short years of operation. The ties were used to build one of the area's earliest residences and the [[Cornelia White House]] still stands today in downtown Palm Springs. 

Congressional Medal of Honor recipient Captain [[William McGonagle]] was a graduate of Coachella High School and made the valley his home after his retirement. [[Mitchell Paige]] was another Congressional Medal of Honor veteran who lived in Palm Desert and has a newly opened middle school in La Quinta named after him. [[Jacqueline Cochran]], founder and director of the Women Airforce Service Pilots lived her last years in Indio. In 2005, [[Microsoft]] CEO [[Bill Gates]] reportedly bought and owns a home in The Vintage Club Country Club in Indian Wells. 

[[Elvis Presley]] [[honeymoon]]ed in Palm Springs in 1967 and was a frequent visitor as well. [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Bob Hope]] and [[Dinah Shore]] were residents of the valley and were instrumental in the creation of three major [[golf]] tournaments, the [[Frank Sinatra Celebrity Golf Tournament]], [[Bob Hope Chrysler Classic]] (now hosted by comedian and golf aficionado [[George Lopez]]) and the [[Nabisco LPGA]] respectively. All three have streets named in their honor as does President [[Gerald Ford]], a longtime Rancho Mirage resident and benefactor of the [[substance abuse]] center that bears his wife's name, the [[Betty Ford Center]] on the campus of the Eisenhower Medical Center, named for general, U.S. president and part-time resident [[Dwight Eisenhower]]. Sinatra and his friends, including [[Dean Martin]], [[Perry Como]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Rosemary Clooney]] and [[Connie Francis]] were frequent visitors in the close-knit celebrity community of the Coachella Valley in the 1950s and 1960s.  

The main road into [[Palm Springs International Airport]], named simply "Airport Road", was renamed [[Kirk Douglas|Kirk Douglas Way]] on October 17, 2004. Douglas, a major area benefactor, lived in the valley for more than fifty years and currently resides in [[Montecito, California|Montecito]]. He is credited with spearheading the drive to modernize the area over those ensuing five decades. His son [[Michael Douglas]], also an actor, is said to own a residence in Palm Springs with his actress wife [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]].

===More famous names===

[[Lucille Ball]] and [[Desi Arnaz]] were instrumental in forming the exclusive Thunderbird Heights tract in Rancho Mirage, once the home of President Gerald Ford and his wife Betty.  According to ''Palm Springs Life'' magazine, that same tract would loan its name to a new car in late 1954, the [[Ford Thunderbird]]. The magazine also cites that a favorite vacation spot for [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] executives, Palm Desert's Eldorado Country Club, loaned its name to [[Cadillac Eldorado|Cadillac's]] top model the year before. Local automotive history also states that designer [[Raymond Loewy]] penned the [[Studebaker Avanti]] in his Palm Springs home. Especially since the 1950s, Palm Springs and nearby golf clubs are hailed as the "playground of celebrities", but in lesser numbers celebrities don't travel or reside in the Palm Springs area as much they used to, but the area's "star power" made a comeback in the 2000s.

Ball and Arnaz helped finance construction of the Indian Wells Country Club. Founded in 1956 with their winter residence on famous ''[[DesiLu]] Court'', Indian Wells became a major factor in "down valley" growth in the 1970s and 1980s. A mostly [[gated community]], Indian Wells has one of the highest ''per capita'' income of any small town in the United States, while nearby Coachella, a short distance southeast on [[California State Route 111|State Route 111]] is the third poorest city of the 10,000-50,000 population range in the nation, though that is rapidly changing as the area develops. A memorial to Eisenhower can be found on the front lawn of Indian Wells City Hall, also features the local veterans memorial plaque to represent the community's 800 veterans, a high number of war veterans per ratio of its' predominantly senior citizen population. Coachella has the [[Vietnam War]] veterans' memorial to represent their community's high representation of armed forces volunteers, a large percentage had Spanish surnames since the city's population are over 90 percent Latino. 

Many other celebrities, past and present, have called the area home.  Among those who grew up in the area:

*President [[John F. Kennedy]] was a frequent guest of Frank Sinatra, and a plaque in one of the pews of Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Palm Desert marks the spot where Kennedy would usually sit during Mass. That same area in Palm Desert once served as a training ground for General [[George Patton|George Patton's]] [[Third Army]] troops and tank battalions; today, the site is home to the very upscale El Paseo shopping district. Patton also trained in a huge plot of desert stretching from [[Chiriaco Summit, California|Chiriaco Summit]] just off the eastern end of the valley northward almost to [[Amboy, California|Amboy]] along [[U.S. Route 66 (California)|U.S. Route 66]] in the [[Mojave Desert]]. Tank tracks from those maneuvers are still visible today in the open desert and a museum dedicated to Patton is located in Chiriaco Summit. Patton was also a frequent guest at the Whittier Ranch House in Indio, a grand adobe structure which had faced the possibility of demolition as the ranch lands surrounding it were being developed. A grass roots organization had petitioned the city to preserve the structure for use as a [[Veterans of Foreign Wars|VFW]] post; it has instead been restored and retained as the clubhouse for the new Whittier Ranch housing development.

*[[Sonny Bono]] ran a restaurant in downtown Palm Springs. Frustrated by the lack of cooperation he faced from the city council over a new sign for the restaurant, the entertainer took matters into his own hands and ran for mayor. He retained local [[conservatism|conservative]] [[talk radio]] host [[Marshall Gilbert]] (heard regularly on [[KNWQ]]) as his campaign manager in a successful bid that not only put Bono back in the public eye, but fueled his later campaign for a seat on the [[United States Congress]], a position he held until his death in a skiing accident in 1998. His widow, [[Mary Bono|Mary]], filled the vacancy left by her husband and later campaigned successfully on her own. Both he and Frank Sinatra are buried at Desert Memorial Park (now the Forest Lawn Mortuary) in Cathedral City.

*The [[La Quinta Resort and Club]], a series of bungalows built in 1926 in what was then known as Marshall's Cove is the oldest resort in the valley. [[Frank Capra]] wrote the script for ''[[Lost Horizon (1937)|Lost Horizon]]'' poolside at the La Quinta. Capra is buried in nearby Coachella.
