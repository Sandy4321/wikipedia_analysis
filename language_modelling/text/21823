'''Elizabeth II''' (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; born 21 April 1926{{ref|birthday|[note 1]}}) is the [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional]] [[monarch]] of 16 [[sovereign state]]s known as the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, head of the 54 member [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and, in her role as the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]], [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]].

Elizabeth was born in London, and educated privately at home. Her father acceded to the throne as [[George VI]] in 1936 on the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication]] of his brother [[Edward VIII]]. She began to undertake public duties during the [[World War II|Second World War]], in which she served in the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]]. On the death of her father in 1952, she became [[Head of the Commonwealth]] and [[queen regnant]] of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]], and [[Dominion of Ceylon|Ceylon]]. Her [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|coronation service]] in 1953 was the first to be televised. Between 1956 and 1992, the number of her realms varied as territories gained independence and some realms became republics. Today, in addition to the first four aforementioned countries, Elizabeth is Queen of [[Jamaica]], [[Barbados]], [[the Bahamas]], [[Grenada]], [[Papua New Guinea]], the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Belize]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], and [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]].

In 1947 she married [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], with whom she has four children: [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]], [[Anne, Princess Royal|Anne]], [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Andrew]], and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Edward]]. In 1992, which Elizabeth termed her ''{{lang|la|[[annus horribilis]]}}'' ("horrible year"), Charles and Andrew separated from their wives, Anne divorced, and a [[1992 Windsor Castle fire|severe fire]] damaged part of [[Windsor Castle]]. Revelations continued on the state of Charles's marriage to [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], and they divorced in 1996. The following year, [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana died in a Paris car crash]], and the media criticised the royal family for remaining in seclusion in the days before [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|her funeral]].<!--Citations given in "1990s" section below: Bond, p. 134; Brandreth, p. 358; Lacey, pp. 6<U+2013>7; Pimlott, p. 616; Roberts, p. 98; Shawcross, p. 8--> Elizabeth's personal popularity rebounded after she appeared in public<!--Citations given in "1990s" section below: Bond, p. 134; Brandreth, p. 359; Lacey, pp. 13<U+2013>15; Pimlott, pp. 623<U+2013>624--> and has subsequently remained high.<!--e.g. Polls cited in "Public perception and character" section below: Ipsos MORI (2006); Populus Ltd (2007); BBC (2007)-->

Her reign of {{age|1952|2|6}} years is the [[List of longest-reigning British monarchs#Overall|second-longest for a British monarch]]; only [[Queen Victoria]] has reigned longer. Her [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver]] and [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilees]] were celebrated in 1977 and 2002; her [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond Jubilee]] is being celebrated during 2012.

==Early life==
[[File:Queen Elizabeth II 1929.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Elizabeth as a thoughtful-looking toddler with curly, fair hair|Princess Elizabeth aged 3, 1929]]
Elizabeth was the first child of Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King [[George VI]]), and his wife, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth]]. Her father was the second son of King [[George V]] and Queen [[Mary of Teck|Mary]], and her mother was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat [[Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne]]. She was born by [[Caesarean section]] at 2.40&nbsp;am (GMT) on 21 April 1926 at her maternal grandfather's London house: 17 Bruton Street, [[Mayfair]].<ref>Bradford, p. 22; Brandreth, p. 103; Pimlott, pp. 2<U+2013>3; Lacey, pp. 75<U+2013>76; Roberts, p. 74</ref> The [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Archbishop of York]], [[Cosmo Lang]], [[Baptism|baptised]] her in the private chapel of [[Buckingham Palace]] on 29 May.<ref>Hoey, p. 40</ref>{{ref|baptism|[note 2]}} She was named Elizabeth after her mother, Alexandra after [[Alexandra of Denmark|George V's mother]], who had died six months earlier, and Mary after her paternal grandmother.<ref>Brandreth, p. 103</ref> Her close family called her "Lilibet".<ref>Pimlott, p. 12</ref> George V cherished his granddaughter, and during his serious illness in 1929 her regular visits were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his recovery.<ref>Lacey, p. 56; Nicolson, p. 433; Pimlott, pp. 14<U+2013>16</ref>

Elizabeth's only sibling was [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]], born in 1930. The two princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother and their [[governess]], [[Marion Crawford]], who was casually known as "Crawfie".<ref>Crawford, p. 26; Pimlott, p. 20; Shawcross, p. 21</ref> Lessons concentrated on history, language, literature and music.<ref>Brandreth, p. 124; Lacey, pp. 62<U+2013>63; Pimlott, pp. 24, 69</ref> To the dismay of the royal family,<ref>Brandreth, pp. 108<U+2013>110; Lacey, pp. 159<U+2013>161; Pimlott, pp. 20, 163</ref> in 1950 Crawford published a biography of Elizabeth and Margaret's childhood years entitled ''The Little Princesses''. The book describes Elizabeth's love of horses and dogs, her orderliness, and her attitude of responsibility.<ref>Brandreth, pp. 108<U+2013>110</ref> Others echoed such observations: [[Winston Churchill]] described Elizabeth when she was two as "a character. She has an air of authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant."<ref>Brandreth, p. 105; Lacey, p. 81; Shawcross, pp. 21<U+2013>22</ref> Her cousin [[Margaret Rhodes]] described her as "a jolly little girl, but fundamentally sensible and well-behaved".<ref>Brandreth, pp. 105<U+2013>106</ref>

==Heiress presumptive==
[[File:Philip Alexius de Laszlo-Princess Elizabeth of York, Currently Queen Elizabeth II of England,1933.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Elizabeth as a rosy-cheeked young girl with blue eyes and fair hair|Princess Elizabeth aged 7, 1933<br />Painting by [[Philip de L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3>]]]]
As a granddaughter of the monarch in the male line, Elizabeth's full style at birth was ''[[Royal Highness|Her Royal Highness]] [[British princess|Princess]] Elizabeth of York''. She was third in the [[Line of succession to the British throne|line of succession to the throne]], behind her uncle, [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]], and her father. Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become queen, as the Prince of Wales was still young, and many assumed he would marry and have children of his own.<ref>Bond, p. 8; Lacey, p. 76; Pimlott, p. 3</ref> In 1936, when her grandfather, [[George V]], died and her uncle Edward succeeded, she became second in line to the throne after her father. Later that year, [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|Edward abdicated]] after his proposed marriage to divorced socialite [[Wallis Simpson]] provoked a constitutional crisis.<ref>Lacey, pp. 97<U+2013>98</ref> Elizabeth's father became king, and she became [[Heir presumptive|heiress presumptive]], with the style ''Her Royal Highness The Princess Elizabeth''.<ref>e.g. {{cite journal|last=Assheton|first=Ralph|date=18 December 1936|title=Succession to the Throne|journal=The Times|page=10}}</ref> If her parents had had a son, he would have been [[heir apparent]] and above her in the line of succession.<ref>Marr, pp. 78, 85; Pimlott, pp. 71<U+2013>73</ref>

Elizabeth received private tuition in constitutional history from [[Henry Marten (educator)|Henry Marten]], [[List of Provosts of Eton College|Vice-Provost]] of [[Eton College]],<ref>Brandreth, p. 124; Crawford, p. 85; Lacey, p. 112; Pimlott, p. 51; Shawcross, p. 25</ref> and learned French from a succession of native-speaking governesses.<ref name="Edu">{{cite web|title=Her Majesty The Queen: Education|publisher=Royal Household|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/Education/Overview.aspx|accessdate=31 May 2010}}</ref>  A [[Girl Guides]] company, the [[Girlguiding London and South East England#1st Buckingham Palace Company|1st Buckingham Palace Company]], was formed specifically so she could socialise with girls her own age.<ref>Pimlott, p. 47</ref> Later she was enrolled as a [[Ranger (Girl Guide)|Sea Ranger]].<ref name="Edu"/>

In 1939 Elizabeth's parents [[1939 royal tour of Canada|toured Canada]] and visited the United States. As in 1927, when her parents had toured Australia and New Zealand, Elizabeth remained in Britain as her father thought her too young to undertake public tours.<ref name=p54>Pimlott, p. 54</ref> Elizabeth "looked tearful" as her parents departed.<ref name=p55>Pimlott, p. 55</ref> They corresponded regularly,<ref name=p55/> and on 18 May, she and her parents made the first royal transatlantic telephone call.<ref name=p54/>

===Second World War===
From September 1939, with the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Elizabeth and Margaret stayed at [[Balmoral Castle]], Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to [[Sandringham House]], [[Norfolk]].<ref>Crawford, pp. 104<U+2013>114; Pimlott, pp. 56<U+2013>57</ref> From February to May 1940, they lived at [[Royal Lodge]], Windsor, until moving to [[Windsor Castle]], where they stayed for most of the next five years.<ref>Crawford, pp. 114<U+2013>119; Pimlott, p. 57</ref> The suggestion by senior politician [[Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham|Lord Hailsham]]<!--Warwick, Christopher (2002). ''Princess Margaret: A Life of Contrasts''. London: Carlton Publishing Group. ISBN 0233051066, p. 102--> that the two princesses should be [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] to Canada was rejected by Elizabeth's mother; she declared, "The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/The%20House%20of%20Windsor%20from%201952/QueenElizabethTheQueenMother/ActivitiesasQueen.aspx|title=Biography of HM Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother: Activities as Queen|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=28 July 2009}}</ref> At Windsor, the princesses staged [[pantomime]]s at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments.<ref>Crawford, pp. 137<U+2013>141</ref> In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Children's Hour]]'', addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities.<ref name="CH">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/princesselizabeth/6600.shtml?all=1&id=6600|title=Children's Hour: Princess Elizabeth|publisher=BBC|date=13 October 1940|accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref> She stated:

In 1943, at the age of 16, Elizabeth undertook her first solo public appearance on a visit to the [[Grenadier Guards]], of which she had been appointed [[Colonel-in-Chief]] the previous year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/Publiclife/EarlyPublicLife/Earlypubliclife.aspx|title=Early public life|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref> As she approached her 18th birthday, the law was changed so that she could act as one of five [[Counsellor of State|Counsellors of State]] in the event of her father's incapacity or absence abroad, such as his visit to Italy in July 1944.<ref>Pimlott, p. 71</ref> In February 1945, she joined the [[Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service]], as an honorary Second [[Subaltern (rank)|Subaltern]] with the [[service number]] of 230873.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=36973|date=6 March 1945|startpage=1315|supp=yes|accessdate=5 June 2010}}</ref> She trained as a driver and mechanic,<ref>Bradford, p. 45; Lacey, p. 148; Pimlott, p. 75</ref> and was promoted to honorary Junior Commander five months later.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=37205|date=31 July 1945|startpage=3972|supp=yes|accessdate=5 June 2010}}</ref>
{{British Royal Family}}
During the war, plans were drawn up to quell [[Welsh nationalism]] by affiliating Elizabeth more closely with Wales.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4329001.stm|title=Royal plans to beat nationalism|publisher=BBC|date=8 March 2005|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> Welsh politicians proposed that Elizabeth be made [[Prince of Wales|Princess of Wales]] on her 18th birthday. The idea was supported by [[Home Secretary]] [[Herbert Morrison]], but rejected by the King because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales, and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent.<ref>Pimlott, pp. 71<U+2013>73</ref> In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh [[Gorsedd]] of Bards at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/911/|title=Gorsedd of the Bards|publisher=National Museum of Wales|accessdate=17 December 2009}}</ref>

At the end of the war in Europe, on [[Victory in Europe Day]], Elizabeth and her sister mingled anonymously with the celebratory crowds in the streets of London. She later said in a rare interview, "we asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised&nbsp;... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down [[Whitehall]], all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief."<ref>Bond, p. 10; Pimlott, p. 79</ref> Two years later, the princess made her first overseas tour, when she accompanied her parents through southern Africa. During the tour, in a broadcast to the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] on her 21st birthday, she pledged: "I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ImagesandBroadcasts/Historic%20speeches%20and%20broadcasts/21stbirthdayspeech21April1947.aspx|title=21st birthday speech|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=28 July 2009}}</ref>

===Marriage===
{{see|Wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten, Duke of Edinburgh}}
Elizabeth met her future husband, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark]], in 1934 and 1937.<ref>Brandreth, pp. 132<U+2013>139; Lacey, pp. 124<U+2013>125; Pimlott, p. 86</ref> After another meeting at the [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College in Dartmouth]] in July 1939, Elizabeth&nbsp;<U+2013> though only 13 years old&nbsp;<U+2013> fell in love with Philip, and they began to exchange letters.<ref>Bond, p. 10; Brandreth, pp. 132<U+2013>136, 166<U+2013>169; Lacey, pp. 119, 126, 135</ref> They married on 20 November 1947 at [[Westminster Abbey]]. They are [[Cousin|second cousins once removed]] through King [[Christian IX of Denmark]] and third cousins through [[Queen Victoria]]. Before the marriage, Philip renounced his Greek and Danish titles, converted from [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodoxy]] to [[Anglicanism]], and adopted the style ''Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten'', taking [[Mountbatten|the surname of his mother's British family]].<ref>Hoey, pp. 55<U+2013>56; Pimlott, pp. 101, 137</ref> Just before the wedding, he was created [[Duke of Edinburgh]] and granted the style of ''His Royal Highness''.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=38128|startpage=5495|date=21 November 1947|accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref>

The marriage was not without controversy: Philip had no financial standing, was foreign-born (though a British subject), and had sisters who had married German noblemen with [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] links.<ref>{{cite web|author=Edwards, Phil|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/R/real_lives/prince_philip_t.html|title=The Real Prince Philip|publisher=Channel 4|date=31 October 2000|accessdate=23 September 2009}}</ref> Marion Crawford wrote, "Some of the King's advisors did not think him good enough for her. He was a prince without a home or kingdom. Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philip's foreign origin."<ref>Crawford, p. 180</ref> Elizabeth's mother was reported, in later biographies, to have opposed the union initially, even dubbing Philip "[[List of terms used for Germans#Hun (derogatory)|The Hun]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/campaigns/queen80/uqphilip.xml|title=Philip, the one constant through her life|accessdate=23 September 2009|author=Davies, Caroline|date=20 April 2006|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> In later life, however, she told biographer [[Tim Heald]] that Philip was "an English gentleman".<ref>Heald, p. xviii</ref>

Elizabeth and Philip received 2500 wedding gifts from around the world,<ref name="news1">{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Factfiles/60diamondweddinganniversaryfacts.aspx|title=60 Diamond Wedding anniversary facts|publisher=Royal Household|date=18 November 2007|accessdate=20 June 2010}}</ref> but Britain had not yet completely rebounded from the devastation of the war. Elizabeth still required [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|ration coupons]] to buy the material for [[Wedding dress of Princess Elizabeth|her gown]], designed by [[Norman Hartnell]].<ref>Hoey, p. 58; Pimlott, pp. 133<U+2013>134</ref> In post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations to be invited to the wedding, including Philip's three surviving sisters.<ref>Hoey, p. 59; Petropoulos, p. 363</ref> [[Edward VIII|Edward]], the former king, was not invited either.<ref>Bradford, p. 61</ref>

Elizabeth gave birth to her first child, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], on 14 November 1948, less than one month after [[letters patent]] were issued by her father allowing her children to use the style and title of a royal prince or princess. They otherwise would not have been entitled to such a status as their father was no longer a royal prince.<ref>Letters Patent, 22 October 1948; Hoey, pp. 69<U+2013>70; Pimlott, pp. 155<U+2013>156</ref> A second child, [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]], was born in 1950.<ref>Pimlott, p. 163</ref>

Following their wedding, the couple leased [[Windlesham Moor]] near [[Windsor Castle]], until 4 July 1949,<ref name="news1"/> when they took up residence at [[Clarence House]] in London. At various times between 1949 and 1951, the Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in the British [[Protectorate]] of [[Malta]] as a serving [[Royal Navy]] officer. He and Elizabeth lived intermittently, for several months at a time, in the Maltese hamlet of [[Gwardaman<U+0121>ia]], at the Villa Gwardaman<U+0121>ia, the rented home of Philip's uncle, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]]. The children remained in Britain.<ref>Brandreth, pp. 226<U+2013>238; Pimlott, pp. 145, 159<U+2013>163, 167</ref>

==Reign==
===Accession and coronation===
[[George VI]]'s health declined during 1951, and Elizabeth was soon frequently standing in for him at public events. In October of that year, she toured Canada, and visited [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]; on the trip, her private secretary, [[Martin Charteris, Baron Charteris of Amisfield|Martin Charteris]], carried a draft accession declaration for use if the King died while she was on tour.<ref>Brandreth, pp. 240<U+2013>241; Lacey, p. 166; Pimlott, pp. 169<U+2013>172</ref> In early 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New Zealand by way of [[Kenya]]. On 6 February 1952, they had just returned to their Kenyan home, [[Sagana Lodge]], after a night spent at [[Treetops Hotel]], when word arrived of the death of Elizabeth's father. Philip broke the news to the new queen.<ref>Brandreth, pp. 245<U+2013>247; Lacey, p. 166; Pimlott, pp. 173<U+2013>176; Shawcross, p.16</ref> Martin Charteris asked her to choose a [[regnal name]]; she chose to remain Elizabeth, "of course".<ref>Bousfield and Toffoli, p. 72; Charteris quoted in Pimlott, p. 179 and Shawcross, p. 17</ref> She was [[Proclamation of accession of Elizabeth II|proclaimed queen]] throughout her realms, and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom.<ref>Pimlott, pp. 178<U+2013>179</ref> She and the Duke of Edinburgh moved into [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref>Pimlott, pp. 186<U+2013>187</ref>
[[File:Elizabeth and Philip 1953.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Elizabeth in crown and robes next to her husband in military uniform|Coronation portrait of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh, June 1953]]

With Elizabeth's accession it seemed likely that the [[royal house]] would bear her husband's name. Lord Mountbatten thought it would be the ''House of Mountbatten'', as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name on marriage; however Elizabeth's grandmother [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] favoured the retention of the [[House of Windsor]], and so Windsor it remained. The Duke complained, "I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children."<ref>Bradford, p. 80; Brandreth, pp. 253<U+2013>254; Lacey, pp. 172<U+2013>173; Pimlott, pp. 183<U+2013>185</ref> After the death of Queen Mary on 24 March 1953 and the resignation of Churchill in 1955, the surname ''[[Mountbatten-Windsor]]'' was adopted in 1960 for Philip and Elizabeth's male-line descendants who do not carry royal titles.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=41948|supp=yes|startpage=1003|date=5 February 1960|accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref>

Amid preparations for the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]], [[Princess Margaret]] informed her sister that she wished to marry [[Peter Townsend (RAF officer)|Peter Townsend]], a divorced [[Commoners in the United Kingdom|commoner]] 16 years older than Margaret with two sons from his previous marriage. The Queen asked them to wait for a year; in the words of Martin Charteris, "the Queen was naturally sympathetic towards the Princess, but I think she thought&nbsp;<U+2013> she hoped&nbsp;<U+2013> given time, the affair would peter out."<ref>Brandreth, pp. 269<U+2013>271</ref> Senior politicians were against the match, and the [[Church of England]] did not permit re-marriage after divorce.

Elizabeth witnessed, over her life, the ongoing transformation of the [[British Empire]] into the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. By the time of Elizabeth's accession in 1952, her role as nominal head of multiple independent states was already established.<ref>Pimlott, p. 182</ref> Spanning 1953<U+2013>54, the Queen and her husband embarked on a six-month around-the-world tour. She became the first reigning [[Monarchy of Australia|monarch of Australia]] and [[Monarchy of New Zealand|New Zealand]] to visit those nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/Australia/Royalvisits.aspx|title=Queen and Australia: Royal visits|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=8 December 2009}}<br />{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/NewZealand/Royalvisits.aspx|title=Queen and New Zealand: Royal visits|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=8 December 2009}}</ref> During the tour, crowds were immense; three-quarters of the population of Australia were estimated to have seen the Queen.<ref>Brandreth, p. 278; Pimlott, p. 224; Shawcross, p. 59</ref> Throughout her reign, Elizabeth has undertaken [[List of state visits made by Queen Elizabeth II|state visits]] to foreign countries, and [[List of Commonwealth visits made by Queen Elizabeth II|tours of Commonwealth ones]].

In 1956, [[Prime Minister of France|French Prime Minister]] [[Guy Mollet]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] Sir [[Anthony Eden]] discussed the possibility of France joining the Commonwealth. The proposal was never accepted, and the following year France signed the [[Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]], the precursor of the European Union.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6261885.stm|title=When Britain and France nearly married|publisher=BBC|date=15 January 2007|accessdate=14 December 2009|first=Mike|last=Thomson}}</ref> In November 1956, Britain and France invaded [[Egypt]] in an [[Suez Crisis|ultimately unsuccessful attempt]] to capture the [[Suez Canal]]. [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] claimed the Queen was opposed to the invasion, though Eden denied it. Eden resigned two months later.<ref>Pimlott, p. 255; Roberts, p. 84</ref>

The absence of a formal mechanism within the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] for choosing a leader meant that, following Eden's resignation, it fell to the Queen to decide whom to [[Kissing Hands|commission to form a government]]. Eden recommended that she consult [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] (the [[Lord President of the Council]]). Lord Salisbury and [[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|Lord Kilmuir]] (the [[Lord Chancellor]]) consulted the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]], [[Winston Churchill]], and the Chairman of the backbench [[1922 Committee]], as a result of which the Queen appointed their recommended candidate: [[Harold Macmillan]].<ref>Marr, pp. 175<U+2013>176; Pimlott, pp. 256<U+2013>260; Roberts, p. 84</ref>

The Suez crisis and the choice of Eden's successor led in 1957 to the first major personal criticism of the Queen. In a magazine, which he owned and edited,<ref>Lacey, p. 199; Shawcross, p. 75</ref> [[John Grigg (writer)|Lord Altrincham]] accused her of being "out of touch".<ref>Lord Altrincham in ''[[National Review (London)|National Review]]'' quoted by Brandreth, p. 374 and Roberts, p. 83</ref> Altrincham was denounced by public figures and physically attacked by a member of the public appalled at his comments.<ref>Brandreth, p. 374; Pimlott, pp. 280<U+2013>281; Shawcross, p. 76</ref> Six years later in 1963, Macmillan resigned and advised the Queen to appoint [[Alec Douglas-Home|the Earl of Home]] as prime minister, advice that she followed.<ref name=r84>Hardman, p. 22; Pimlott, pp. 324<U+2013>335; Roberts, p. 84</ref> The Queen again came under criticism for appointing the Prime Minister on the advice of a small number of ministers, or a single minister.<ref name=r84/> In 1965, the Conservatives adopted a formal mechanism for choosing a leader, thus relieving her of involvement.<ref>Roberts, p. 84</ref>
{{Wikisource|Queen Elizabeth II's Address to the United Nations General Assembly}}

In 1957, she made a state visit to the United States, where she addressed the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. On the same tour, she opened the [[23rd Canadian Parliament]], becoming the first [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch of Canada]] to open a parliamentary session.<ref name=Canada>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/Canada/Royalvisits.aspx|title=Queen and Canada: Royal visits|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref> Two years later, she revisited the United States as a representative of Canada.<ref name=Canada/><ref>Bradford, p. 114</ref> In 1961, she toured Cyprus, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Iran.<ref>Pimlott, p. 303; Shawcross, p. 83</ref> On a visit to [[Ghana]] the same year, she dismissed fears for her safety, even though her host [[Heads of state of Ghana|President]] [[Kwame Nkrumah]], who had replaced her as head of state, was a target for assassins.<ref name=mac/> Harold Macmillan wrote: "The Queen has been absolutely determined all through&nbsp;...

Elizabeth's pregnancies with Princes [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Andrew]] and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Edward]] in 1959 and 1963, respectively, mark the only times she has not performed the [[State Opening of Parliament|State Opening of the British parliament]] during her reign.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dymond, Glenn|date=5 March 2010|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/documents/upload/lln2010-007.pdf|title=Ceremonial in the House of Lords|publisher=House of Lords Library|page=12|accessdate=5 June 2010}}</ref>  In addition to performing traditional ceremonies, she also instituted new practices. Her first royal walkabout, meeting ordinary members of the public, took place during a tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/Publiclife/PublicLife1962-1971/1962-1971.aspx|title=Public life 1962<U+2013>1971|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=1 September 2011}}</ref>

The 1960s and 1970s saw an acceleration in the [[decolonisation]] of Africa and [[the Caribbean]]. Over 20 countries gained independence from Britain as part of a planned transition to self-government. In 1965, however, [[Rhodesia]]n Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]] [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|declared unilateral independence]] in opposition to moves toward majority black rule. Although the Queen dismissed Smith in a formal declaration and the international community applied sanctions against Rhodesia, Smith's regime survived for over a decade.<ref>Bond, p. 66; Pimlott, pp. 345<U+2013>354</ref>

In February 1974, British Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] called a [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|general election]] in the middle of the Queen's tour of the [[Austronesia]]n [[Pacific Rim]] and she had to fly back to Britain, interrupting the tour.<ref>Pimlott, p. 418</ref> The inconclusive result of the election meant that Heath, whose Conservative party had the largest share of the popular vote but no overall majority, could stay in office if he formed a coalition with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]]. Heath only resigned when discussions on forming a cooperative government foundered, after which the Queen asked the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour's]] [[Harold Wilson]], to form a government.<ref>Pimlott, p. 419; Shawcross, pp. 109<U+2013>110</ref>

A year later, at the height of the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]], [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]] was dismissed from his post by [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] Sir [[John Kerr (Governor-General)|John Kerr]] after the Opposition-controlled [[Australian Senate|Senate]] rejected Whitlam's budget proposals.<ref name="Aus">Bond, p. 96; Pimlott, p. 427; Shawcross, p. 110</ref> As Whitlam had a majority in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], [[Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Gordon Scholes]] appealed to the Queen to reverse Kerr's decision. Elizabeth declined, stating that she would not interfere in decisions reserved by the [[constitution of Australia]] for the governor-general.<ref>Pimlott, pp. 428<U+2013>429</ref> The crisis fuelled [[Republicanism in Australia|Australian republicanism]].<ref name="Aus"/>

===Silver Jubilee===
In 1977, Elizabeth marked [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|the Silver Jubilee of her accession]]. Parties and events took place throughout the Commonwealth, many coinciding with the [[List of events during the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Queen's associated national and Commonwealth tours]]. The celebrations re-affirmed the Queen's popularity, despite virtually coincident negative press coverage of Princess Margaret's separation from her husband.<ref>Pimlott, p. 449</ref> In 1978, Elizabeth endured a state visit to the United Kingdom by [[Romania]]'s communist dictator [[Nicolae Ceau<U+015F>escu]], and his wife [[Elena Ceau<U+015F>escu|Elena]],<ref>Hardman, p. 137; Roberts, pp. 88<U+2013>89; Shawcross, p. 178</ref> though privately she thought they had "blood on their hands".<ref>Elizabeth to her staff, quoted in Shawcross, p. 178</ref> The following year brought two blows: one was the unmasking of [[Anthony Blunt]], former [[Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures]], as a communist spy; the other was the assassination of her relative and in-law [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]].<ref>Pimlott, pp. 336<U+2013>337, 470<U+2013>471; Roberts, pp. 88<U+2013>89</ref>

According to [[Paul Joseph James Martin|Paul Martin, Sr.]], by the end of the 1970s the Queen was worried the Crown "had little meaning for" [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]].<ref name=Post /> [[Tony Benn]] said that the Queen found Trudeau "rather disappointing".<ref name=Post>{{Cite journal|last=Heinricks|first=Geoff|title=Trudeau: A drawer monarchist|journal=[[National Post]]|date=29 September 2000|page=B12}}</ref> Trudeau's supposed republicanism seemed to be confirmed by his antics, such as sliding down banisters at Buckingham Palace and pirouetting behind the Queen's back in 1977, and the removal of various [[Canadian royal symbols]] during his term of office.<ref name=Post /> In 1980, Canadian politicians sent to London to discuss the [[patriation]] of the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]] found the Queen "better informed on&nbsp;... Canada's constitutional case than any of the British politicians or bureaucrats".<ref name=Post/> She was interested in the constitutional debate after the failure of Bill C-60, which would have affected her role as [[head of state]].<ref name=Post/> Patriation removed the role of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] in the Canadian constitution, but the monarchy was retained. Trudeau said in his memoirs: "The Queen favoured my attempt to reform the Constitution. I was always impressed not only by the grace she displayed in public at all times, but by the wisdom she showed in private conversation."<ref>Trudeau, p. 313</ref>

===1980s===
[[File:ElizabethIItroopingcolour crop.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Elizabeth in red uniform on a black horse|Elizabeth riding [[Burmese (horse)|Burmese]] at a Trooping the Colour ceremony]]
During the 1981 [[Trooping the Colour]] ceremony, and only six weeks before the [[wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer]], six shots were fired at the Queen from close range as she rode down [[The Mall (London)|The Mall]] on her horse, [[Burmese (horse)|Burmese]]. Police later discovered that the shots were blanks. The 17-year-old assailant, [[Marcus Sarjeant]], was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/14/newsid_2516000/2516713.stm|title=Queen's 'fantasy assassin' jailed|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 June 2010|date=14 September 1981}}</ref> The Queen's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised.<ref>Lacey, p. 281; Pimlott, pp. 476<U+2013>477; Shawcross, p. 192</ref> The following year, the Queen awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder, [[Michael Fagan incident|Michael Fagan]], in the room with her. Remaining calm, and through two calls to the palace police switchboard, the Queen spoke to Fagan while he sat at the foot of her bed until assistance arrived seven minutes later.<ref>Lacey, pp. 297<U+2013>298; Pimlott, p. 491</ref> From April to September that year, the Queen remained anxious<ref>Bond, p. 115</ref> but proud<ref>Shawcross, p. 127</ref> of her son, Prince Andrew, who was serving with British forces during the [[Falklands War]]. Though she hosted President [[Ronald Reagan]] at Windsor Castle in 1982, and visited [[Rancho del Cielo|his Californian ranch]] in 1983, she was angered when his administration ordered the [[invasion of Grenada]], one of her Caribbean realms, without her foreknowledge.<ref>Bond, p. 188; Pimlott, p. 497</ref>

Intense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true.<ref>Pimlott, pp. 488<U+2013>490</ref> As [[Kelvin MacKenzie]], editor of ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'', told his staff: "Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true&nbsp;<U+2013> so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards."<ref>Pimlott, p. 521</ref> Newspaper editor [[Donald Trelford]] wrote in ''[[The Observer]]'' of 21 September 1986: "The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of&nbsp;... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not." It was reported, most notably in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' of 20 July 1986, that Elizabeth was worried that [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s economic policies fostered social divisions, and was alarmed by high unemployment, [[1981 England riots|a series of riots]], the violence of a [[UK miners' strike (1984<U+2013>1985)|miners' strike]], and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the [[apartheid]] regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide [[Michael Shea (diplomat)|Michael Shea]] and [[Commonwealth Secretary-General]] [[Shridath Ramphal]], but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation.<ref>Pimlott, pp. 503<U+2013>515; see also Neil, pp. 195<U+2013>207 and Shawcross, pp. 129<U+2013>132</ref> Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]]<U+2014>Thatcher's political opponents.<ref>Thatcher to [[Brian Walden]] quoted in Neil, p. 207; [[Andrew Neil]] quoted in [[Woodrow Wyatt]]'s diary of 26 October 1990</ref> Thatcher's biographer [[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]] claimed "...&nbsp;the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making".<ref>Campbell, p. 467</ref> Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen,<ref>Thatcher, p. 309</ref> and after Thatcher's replacement by [[John Major]], Elizabeth gave two honours in her personal gift to Thatcher: appointment to the [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]] and the [[Order of the Garter]].<ref>Roberts, p. 101; Shawcross, p. 139</ref>

In 1987, the elected [[Fiji]]an government was deposed in [[1987 Fijian coups d'<U+00E9>tat|a military coup]]. Elizabeth, as head of state, supported the attempts of the [[Governor-General of Fiji|Governor-General]], ''Ratu'' Sir [[Penaia Ganilau]], to assert executive power and negotiate a settlement. Coup leader [[Sitiveni Rabuka]] deposed Ganilau, abolished the [[Monarchy of Fiji|monarchy]], and declared Fiji a republic.<ref>Pimlott, pp. 515<U+2013>516</ref> By the start of 1991, republican feeling in Britain had risen because of press estimates of the Queen's private wealth, which were contradicted by the palace, and reports of affairs and strained marriages among her extended family.<ref>Pimlott, pp. 519<U+2013>534</ref> The involvement of the younger royals in the charity game show ''[[It's a Royal Knockout]]'' was ridiculed,<ref>Hardman, p. 81; Lacey, p. 307; Pimlott, pp. 522<U+2013>526</ref> and the Queen was the target of satire.<ref>Lacey, pp. 293<U+2013>294; Pimlott, p. 541</ref>

===1990s===
In 1991, in the wake of victory in the [[Gulf War]], Elizabeth became the first British monarch to address a joint session of the [[United States Congress]].<ref>Pimlott, p. 538</ref> The following year, she attempted to save the failing marriage of her eldest son, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]], by counselling him and his wife, [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], to reconcile.<ref>Brandreth, p. 349; Lacey, p. 319</ref>

In a speech on 24 November 1992, to mark the 40th anniversary of her accession, the Queen called 1992 her ''[[annus horribilis]]'', meaning ''horrible year''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ImagesandBroadcasts/Historic%20speeches%20and%20broadcasts/Annushorribilisspeech24November1992.aspx|title=Annus horribilis speech, 24 November 1992|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref> In March, her second son [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]], and his wife [[Sarah, Duchess of York]], separated.

Her sister and mother died in February and March, respectively, and the media speculated as to whether the Jubilee would be a success or a failure.<ref>Bond, p. 156</ref> She again undertook an extensive tour of her realms, which began in Jamaica in February, where she called the farewell banquet "memorable" after a power cut plunged the [[King's House, Jamaica|King's House]], the official residence of the [[Governor-General of Jamaica|Governor-General]], into darkness.<ref>Brandreth, p. 31</ref> As in 1977, there were street parties and commemorative events, and monuments were named to honour the occasion. A million people attended each day of the three-day main Jubilee celebration in London,<ref>Bond, pp. 166<U+2013>167</ref> and the enthusiasm shown by the public for Elizabeth was greater than many journalists had predicted.<ref>Bond, p. 157</ref>

Though generally healthy throughout her life, in 2003 she had [[keyhole surgery]] on both knees, and in June 2005 she cancelled several engagements after contracting a bad cold. In October 2006, she missed the opening of the new [[Emirates Stadium]] because of a strained back muscle that had been troubling her since the summer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6087724.stm|title=Queen cancels visit due to injury|publisher=BBC|date=26 October 2006|accessdate=8 December 2009}}</ref> Two months later, she was seen in public with a [[Adhesive bandage|bandage]] on her right hand, which led to press speculation of ill health.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-420950/Plaster-Queens-hand-minor-cut-IV-drip.html|title=Plaster on Queen's hand: minor cut or IV drip?|author=Greenhill, Sam; Hope, Jenny|work=Daily Mail|date=6 December 2006|accessdate=8 December 2009}}</ref> She had been bitten by one of her [[Pembroke Welsh Corgi|corgi]]s while she was separating two that were fighting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article75313.ece|title=Corgi put the queen in plaster|author=Whittaker, Thomas|work=The Sun|date=14 December 2006|accessdate=18 August 2011}}</ref>

In May 2007, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper reported claims from unnamed sources that the Queen was "exasperated and frustrated" by the policies of British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], that she had shown concern that the [[British Armed Forces]] were overstretched in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], and that she had raised concerns over rural and countryside issues with Blair repeatedly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1552769/Revealed-Queens-dismay-at-Blair-legacy.html|author=Alderson, Andrew|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Revealed: Queen's dismay at Blair legacy|date=28 May 2007|accessdate=31 May 2010}}</ref> She was, however, said to admire Blair's efforts to achieve peace in [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/27/nqueen127.xml|author=Alderson, Andrew|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Tony and Her Majesty: an uneasy relationship|date=27 May 2007|accessdate=31 May 2010}}</ref> On 20 March 2008, at the [[Church of Ireland]] [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh (Church of Ireland)|St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh]], the Queen attended the first [[Royal Maundy|Maundy service]] held outside of England and Wales.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7305675.stm |title=Historic first for Maundy service|publisher=BBC|date=20 March 2008|accessdate=12 October 2008}}</ref> At the invitation of Irish President [[Mary McAleese]], in May 2011 the Queen made the first [[Queen Elizabeth II's visit to the Republic of Ireland|state visit to the Republic of Ireland]] by a British monarch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/what-we-do/public-diplomacy/state-visit-ireland-2011|title=Queen's State Visit to Ireland 2011|publisher=Foreign and Commonwealth Office|accessdate=21 June 2011}}</ref>

==Public perception and character==
{{Main|Personality and image of Queen Elizabeth II}}
Since Elizabeth rarely gives interviews, little is known of her personal feelings. As a [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarch]], she has not expressed her own political opinions in a public forum. She does have a deep sense of religious and civic duty, and takes her coronation oath seriously.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4921120.stm|title=Queen 'will do her job for life'|publisher=BBC|date=19 April 2006|accessdate=4 February 2007}}<br />Shawcross, pp. 194<U+2013>195</ref> Aside from her [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom#Religious role|official religious role]] as [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]] of the [[State religion|established]] [[Church of England]], she personally worships with that church and with the national [[Church of Scotland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/about_us/how_we_are_organised|title=How we are organised|publisher=Church of Scotland|accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref> She has demonstrated support for [[Interfaith|inter-faith]] relations, and has met with leaders of other religions, and granted her personal [[patronage]] to [[the Council of Christians and Jews]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccj.org.uk/Presidents-and-Vice-Presidents|title=Presidents, Vice Presidents and Trustees|publisher=Council of Christians and Jews|accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref> A personal note about her faith often features in her annual [[Royal Christmas Message]] broadcast to the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], such as in 2000, when she spoke about the theological significance of the [[millennium]] marking the 2000th anniversary of the birth of [[Jesus Christ]]:

In the 1950s, as a young woman at the start of her reign, Elizabeth was depicted as a glamorous "fairytale Queen".<ref>Bond, p. 22</ref> After the trauma of the war, it was a time of hope, a period of progress and achievement heralding a "new Elizabethan age".<ref>Bond, p. 35; Pimlott, p. 180; Roberts, p. 82; Shawcross, p. 50</ref> [[John Grigg, 2nd Baron Altrincham|Lord Altrincham]]'s accusation in 1957 that her speeches sounded like those of a "priggish schoolgirl" was an extremely rare criticism.<ref>Bond, p. 35; Pimlott, p. 280; Shawcross, p. 76</ref> In the late 1960s, attempts to portray a more modern image of monarchy were made in the television documentary ''[[Royal Family (documentary)|Royal Family]]'', and by televising Prince Charles's [[Investiture of the Prince of Wales|investiture as Prince of Wales]].<ref>Bond, pp. 66<U+2013>67, 84, 87<U+2013>89; Bradford, pp. 160<U+2013>163; Hardman, pp. 22, 210<U+2013>213; Lacey, pp. 222<U+2013>226; Marr, p. 237; Pimlott, pp. 378<U+2013>392; Roberts, pp. 84<U+2013>86</ref>

At her [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]] in 1977, the crowds and celebrations were genuinely enthusiastic,<ref>Bond, p. 97; Pimlott, pp. 449<U+2013>450; Roberts, p. 87; Shawcross, pp. 114<U+2013>117</ref> but in the 1980s public criticism of the royal family increased, as the personal and working lives of Elizabeth's children came under media scrutiny.<ref>Bond, p. 117; Roberts, p. 91</ref> Elizabeth's popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s. Under pressure from public opinion, she began to pay income tax for the first time, and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public.<ref>Bond, p. 134; Pimlott, pp. 556<U+2013>561, 570</ref> Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]], though the Queen's popularity rebounded after her live broadcast to the world five days after Diana's death.<ref>Bond, p. 134; Pimlott, pp. 624<U+2013>625</ref>

===Titles and styles===
{{Main|List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II}}
Elizabeth has held titles throughout her life, as a granddaughter of the monarch, as a daughter of the monarch, through her husband's titles, and eventually as Sovereign. In common parlance, she is ''The Queen'' or ''Her Majesty''. Officially, she has a distinct title in each of her realms: [[Queen of Canada]] in Canada, [[Queen of Australia]] in Australia, etc. In the [[Channel Islands]] and [[Isle of Man]], which are [[Crown dependencies]] rather than separate realms, she is known as [[Duke of Normandy]] and [[Lord of Mann]] respectively. Additional styles include [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]] and [[Duke of Lancaster]]. When in conversation with the Queen, the practice is to initially address her as ''Your Majesty'' and thereafter as ''Ma'am''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/GreetingamemberofTheRoyalFamily/Overview.aspx|title=Greeting a member of The Royal Family|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=21 August 2009}}</ref>

She has received [[List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II|honours and awards]] from around the world, and has held honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, both before and after her accession.

===Arms===
{{See also|Flags of Elizabeth II}}
From 21 April 1944, Elizabeth's arms consisted of a [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]] bearing the [[royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]], differenced with a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points [[argent]], the centre point bearing a [[Tudor rose]] and the first and third a [[St George's Cross|cross of St. George]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ltgov.bc.ca/govhouse/heraldry.htm|title=Heraldry Traditions|publisher=Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia|year=2007|accessdate=21 June 2010}}</ref> After her accession as Sovereign, she adopted the royal coat of arms undifferenced. The design of the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] is also used on the [[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom]]. Elizabeth has personal flags for use in [[Queen's Personal Canadian Flag|Canada]], [[Queen's Personal Australian Flag|Australia]], [[Queen's Personal Flag for New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Queen's Personal Jamaican Flag|Jamaica]], [[Queen's Personal Barbadian Flag|Barbados]], and [[Personal Flag of Queen Elizabeth II|elsewhere]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/Personalflags.aspx|title=Personal flags|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=21 June 2010}}</ref>
