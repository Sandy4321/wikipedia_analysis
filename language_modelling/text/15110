==Plot summary (de Camp)==

Conan is exploring the haunted [[ruins]] of the ancient city of Larsha in the country of Zamora, led there by rumors of hidden treasure. Behind him in pursuit is a squad of Zamorian [[soldier]]s sent to capture him for crimes of theft against rich [[merchant]]s and [[nobility|nobles]]. Leading them is a [[captain]] from Gunderland named Nestor, and as he turns his head to berate his men for their constant chatter, he fails to see a [[rawhide]] [[tripwire]] set earlier by Conan. Nestor falls sprawling in the grass and sets off the trap as a large pile of rocks wipes out his men, leaving him battered and bruised but alive.

Enraged at the loss of his men and fearing the consequences of returning without his prisoner, Nestor decides to pursue Conan alone. He finally confronts him just outside the walls of Larsha as the young [[barbarian]] is searching for a way in. The two engage in fierce [[hand to hand combat|swordplay]] until Conan strikes Nestor in the head, penetrating his [[helmet]] and sending him to the ground unconscious.

Conan then makes his way into the deserted city and begins to thread the winding streets, recalling the tales he had heard concerning a horrible doom that befell trespassers, and soon confronts a monster in the form of a giant [[slug]], fifty feet long with the ability to spit a corrosive [[acid]] with deadly accuracy. The slug chases Conan throughout the city until he climbs up to the roof of a decaying [[temple]] and manages to knock over some [[gargoyle]] statuary, one after the other, crushing the monster to death.

After climbing back down and making sure the slug is dead, he hears a familiar voice and turns to see Nestor confronting him again, this time with a bandaged head wound. Conan's blow had only succeeded in injuring him, but just as they are about to resume the combat they come to a mutual agreement to search for the treasure as allies and divide whatever they find among themselves.

They enter the royal [[palace]] of Larsha, intricately carved from a single large rock formation of black [[basalt]], and where the treasure is supposed to lie hidden. They light torches to find their way through various passages and eventually come to a [[burial vault (tomb)|vault]]. Gaining entry, they discover inside a glittering hoard of treasure - gold, silver and jewels in a vast pile of splendour. However, guarding this ancient wealth are the [[mummy|mummified]] corpses of seven giant [[warrior]]s seated in chairs, which promptly come to life and attack the pair of adventurers as they are gathering the treasure.

After a desperate fight, Conan and Nestor escape from the vault with the mummies in pursuit. As they follow them out into the dawn light the [[undead]] creatures immediately turn to dust, the [[necromancy|necromantic]] spell broken. Then the earth beneath their feet begins to tremble in a great [[earthquake]] as walls and columns lean and fall. Conan escapes the final ruin of the city but Nestor is nowhere to be found. Calling his name and getting no response, Conan assumes the worst and heads back toward the city of Shadizar with his bag of plunder.

That night in Shadizar Conan swaggers into his favorite [[tavern]] and makes his way to the table where his sweetheart of the moment sits [[beer|drinking]] alone and begins boasting of his adventure. He empties the contents of his treasure bag, seven priceless green jewels worth enough to buy an entire [[kingdom]], onto the table and, like the seven undead guardians, they too crumble into worthless powder much to his chagrin. A [[magistrate]] then enters the tavern followed by a squad of the [[police|night watch]] with the intent to arrest him on his original charges of theft and the slaying of Nestor's men. As it turned out, Nestor survived the earthquake at Larsha and was discovered by the authorities drunk and like Conan boasting of his feat. When they had tried to apprehend Nestor he escaped but lost his loot to the police who made a dash to recover it for themselves. The magistrate who confronted Conan then reached inside the bag on the table where Conan's last remaining prize was concealed, a [[statuette]] in the form of a [[jade]] green [[snake|serpent]]. As the man thrust his hand inside, the statuette came to life and bit [[venom|venomously]] into his flesh, and in the resulting panic and confusion Conan made good his own escape.

On the road outside Shadizar, Conan and Nestor meet at a prearranged spot and share news of one another's misadventures. After accepting their [[destiny|fates]] with grim humor, the two amicably decide to part ways.

==Plot overview (2006 Dark Horse adaptation)==

As the plot began, Conan was being hunted by the mercenary Gunderman and his master's army. Conan used a trap involving rocks to decimate Gunderman's unit, but the mercenary followed him into a mysterious abandoned city. Conan was quickly surrounded by red toads, who bring an idol to life. Drawn into the living toad idol's belly, Conan had a vision of a blind serpent and three mysterious robed men. He then cut his way out of the toad's belly and slew the magical beast.

Gunderman approached Conan, who offered to share the fabled treasure with him. Gunderman agreed, and the two thieves entered a tomb where three petrified sorcerers sat. Conan shrugged off another vision, and destroyed the corpses. Conan stole two green jewels while Gunderman filled his bags with gold; however, the destruction of the petrified corpses incited the rest of the guard to rise from the dead and attack the two men.

Conan and Gunderman drew the corpses into the sunlight, and they turned to dust. However, the city began to crumble and Conan barely escaped with his life. It appeared that Gunderman was lost, and Conan returned to the city to retrieve his girl and settle his debt with Gunderman's former master. Conan turned over the jewelled eyes, which appeared to come to life. Conan did not stay to see; he retreated with his female partner and ran into the night.
