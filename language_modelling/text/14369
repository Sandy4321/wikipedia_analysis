'''Malvern water''' is a natural [[spring water]] from the [[Malvern Hills]] on the border of the counties of [[Herefordshire]] and [[Worcestershire]] in England.<ref name=GeoHackMalvernWater/> The Hills consist of very hard [[granite]] and [[limestone]] rock. Fissures in the rock retain rain water, which slowly permeates through, escaping at the springs. The springs release an average of about 60 litres a minute and the flow has never been known to cease.

Beneficial properties of the water have been celebrated for over four hundred years,<ref name=poynter/> although the reason for such benefits was a topic of dispute as far back as 1817.<ref name=Chambers1817/> In the 19th century [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]] became famous for the [[water cure (therapy)|water cure]], resulting in its rapid development from a village to a busy town with many large Victorian and Edwardian hotels.<ref name=Metcalfe1877/><ref name=Metcalfe1898/> The writings of some former cure patients including [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Charles Dickens]], contributed both to Malvern's renown at that time, and to what is currently known about that period in Malvern's history.<ref name=Oddfish/><ref name=LyttonWaterpatient/> 

The water has been [[Malvern Water (bottled water)|bottled]] on a commercial scale under the [[Schweppes]] brand since 1850, and on a smaller scale by a family-owned company since 2009 as Holywell Spring Water. It has been drunk by several British monarchs.<ref name=Hansard1983/> [[Queen Elizabeth I]] drank it in public in the 16th century; [[Queen Victoria]] refused to travel without it, and it is the only bottled water used by [[Queen Elizabeth II]], which she takes on her travels around the world.<ref name=BBC_QEII/>

{{rellink|See also [[Hydrogeology]] and [[Groundwater recharge]]}}
The quality of Malvern water is attributable to its source. [[Malvern Hills]] are amongst the oldest and hardest rocks found in the United Kingdom, with their geology responsible for the quality of Malvern's spring water.<ref name=Smart2009/><ref name=LaMoreaux&Tanner2001/> The hills consist of [[Precambrian]] [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]], the oldest of which are about 670 million years old.<ref name=GulletQuarry/><ref name=Gibbons&Harris1994/> The rocks are characterised by low porosity and high secondary permeability via fissures.<ref name=Hydrology&Geomorphology/><ref name=HydrogeologyMalvernHills/> Malvern water is rainwater and snow meltwater that percolates through fissures created by the pressures of [[tectonic]] movements about 300 million years ago when advancing sedimentary layers of [[Silurian]] [[shale]] and [[limestone]] were pushed into and under older Precambrian rock.<ref name=LaMoreaux&Tanner2001/><ref name=HydrogeologyMalvernHills/><ref name=geo/> When the fissures are saturated, a [[water table]] forms and the water emerges as springs around the fault lines between the strata. Depending on rainfall, the flow can vary from as little as 36 litres (8 gallons) per minute to over 350 litres (77 gallons) per minute.<ref name=Blyth1967/> The water  permeates through the rock which, because of its hardness, leaves little or no mineral traces in the water, while at the same time the very fine cracks act as a filter for other impurities.<ref name=HydrogeologyMalvernHills/>  Rainfall on the Malvern Hills is thought to be sufficient to account for all the water that runs out of the springs, reflected for example in some spring flows six to eight weeks after heavy rainfall, and in reduced flows after a dry period.<ref name=CollectingMalvernWater/>

==Purity==
Malvern water has long been acclaimed for its purity. In 1756 Dr John Wall tested the water, found that it contained very few minerals,<ref name=MalvernHillsDCApr2008/> and said: "''The Malvern water is famous for containing just nothing at all...!''"<ref name=Wall1756/><ref name="McMenemy1953"/> [[William Heberden]] also noted the purity of Malvern water,<ref name=Heberden1806/> stating "the Malvern water is purer than that of any other springs in England, which I ever examined or heard of".<ref name=Gully1850/>  

The natural untreated water is generally devoid of all [[minerals]], bacteria, and suspended matter, approaching the purity of [[distilled water]]. In 1987 Malvern gained official EU status as a natural [[mineral water]], a mark of purity and quality. However, in spite of regular quality analysis,<ref name=BacteriologicalSampling2010/> drought in 2006 dried out the rock that filters the water, allowing the water to flow through it too quickly for the natural filtering process.<ref name=Poulter2007/> Due to the slight impurities, the Coca-Cola Company, manufacturer of the Schweppes brand, had to install filtration equipment,<ref name=Connell2007/> which reclassifies the water as [[spring water]] under EU law.<ref name=VanDerAa/>

==Springs==
[[File:BarnardsGreenTrough.JPG|thumb|200px|Barnards Green Trough was plumbed to  receive Malvern water. According  to  its inscription, it is dedicated to the horses used by the military  in World War I.]]
There are sources in about 70 locations around the Hills,<ref name=MalvernSpaAssocSprings/> where residents regularly fill containers free of charge, including the [[St. Ann's Well, Malvern|St Ann's Well]],<ref name=StAnnsWellwebsite/> which is housed in a building dating from 1815, in the town of [[Great Malvern]]. Major popular water sources are:

* Beauchamp Fountain <U+2013> Cowleigh Road
* Enigma Fountain plus Malvhina water feature, Belle Vue Terrace <U+2013> town centre
* Evendine Spring <U+2013> Jubilee Drive (west flank of the Hills)
* Hayslad Spring <U+2013> [[West Malvern]] Road
* Holy Well <U+2013> [[Malvern Wells]]
* Jubilee Fountain <U+2013> Malvern Wells
* Morris Well, Wells Common <U+2013> Lower Wyche
* St Ann's Well <U+2013> Great Malvern

The Walms Well dating from  around 250 BC is one of the earliest to be documented.<ref name=WalmsWell/>

==Medicinal use==
[[File:Malvern Darwin plaque.jpg|thumb|200px|Charles Darwin stayed in Malvern. He hoped that the water would improve his daughter's health.]]
Malvern water has long been considered to have curative properties. Cure tourism began around a century before Gully and Wilson opened their clinics. In a letter dated 18 July 1759 to Mrs Montague, [[Benjamin Stillingfleet]] writes: ''"I have been at Malvern about twelve days, where, with difficulty, I have got a lodging, the place is so full, nor do I wonder at it, there being some instances of very extraordinary cures, in cases looked on as desperate, even by Dr. Wall, who first brought these waters into vogue...The road is very fine, and made on purpose for the convenience of the drinkers"''.<ref name=Chambersp277/>

A song reproduced in a book by Dr John Wall and again in Nash 1778 ''History of Worcestershire'', is affirmed to be composed by the parish clerk about the year 1590 and is one of the earliest records of the 'medicinal virtue and purity of these waters'.<ref name=Chambersp14-18/> In 1622 Bannister writes, with reference to the spring at Holywell, in his ''Breviary of the Eyes:''<ref name=poynter/><ref name="McMenemy1953"/><ref name=Chambersp140/> {{cquote |A little more I'll of their curing tell.<br />How they helped sore eyes with a new found well. <br />Great speech of Malvern Hills was late reported<br />Unto which spring people in troops resorted.}} 

In 1842 Drs [[James Manby Gully]] and James Wilson opened [[Hydrotherapy#Revival and practice of hydrotherapy|water cure clinics]] at Malvern,<ref name="Price1981"/><ref name=Gully&Wilson1843/><ref name=Gully1869/><ref name=GullyArchive/>  thus beginning the town's prosperity.<ref name="McMenemy1953sp3vp7"/> Based on the therapy offered at [[Vincent Priessnitz]]'s clinic in [[L<U+00E1>zn<U+011B> Jesen<U+00ED>k|Gr<U+00E4>fenberg]], Silesia,<ref name=Metcalfe1898/><ref name=Bradley2003/> then part of the Austrian Empire (now in the [[Czech Republic]]),  the centre was Britain's first purpose built water cure establishment.<ref>[http://www.malverncivicsociety.org.uk/what_we_do.htm Malvern Civic Society commemorative plaque.] Retrieved 3 February 2010.</ref> As the fame of the establishment grew, Gully and Wilson became well-known national figures.<ref name="Price1981"/> Two more clinics were opened at Malvern.<ref name=MalvernHealthorg/> Famous patients included [[Charles Darwin]]'s daughter (who died and is buried in Malvern), [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Florence Nightingale]], [[Lord Tennyson]], [[Samuel Wilberforce]],<ref name=Swinton1980/> and [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton|Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton]],<ref name="LyttonWaterpatient"/> whose wrting contributed to the popularity of Malvern water.<ref name="Price1981"/> The fame of Gully and Wilson was not without detractors; [[Sir Charles Hastings]], the founder of the [[British Medical Association]], was extremely critical of hydropathy, and of Dr Gully in particular.<ref name=Bradley&Dupree2003/>

==Commercialisation==
{{Main|Malvern Water (bottled water)}}
[[File:MalvernWater bottle.jpg|thumb|75px|An early 20th century Malvern Water (St Ann's Well) bottle.]]
Malvern water has been bottled and distributed in the UK and abroad from as early as the reign of [[James I of England|James I]],<ref name=Smart2009/> with water bottling at the Holy Well being recorded in 1622.<ref name=MalvernHillsDCApr2008/> Various local grocers have bottled and distributed Malvern water during the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it was first bottled on a large commercial scale by [[Schweppes]], who opened a bottling plant at Holywell in [[Malvern Wells]] in 1850. As official caterers to the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851,<ref name=Briggs1981/> Schweppes introduced the water as Malvern Soda,<ref name=Moskowitz1987/> later renaming it Malvern Seltzer Water in 1856.<ref name=cokecce/><ref name=SchweppesMalvernSeltzer1856/> In 1890 Schweppes moved away from Holywell, entered into a contract with a [[Colwall]] family, and built a bottling plant in the village in 1892.<ref name=cokecce/><ref name=AboutColwall/> The Holywell was subsequently leased to John and Henry Cuff, who bottled there until the 1960s.<ref name=msa/><ref name=McComb2009/><ref name=Richardson1930/>  The Holywell became derelict until 2009 when with the aid of a Lottery Heritage grant, production of 1200 bottles per day of Holywell Spring Water was recommenced by an independent family-owned company.<ref name=msa/> The well is believed to  be the oldest  bottling  plant in the word.<ref name=MalvernGazette091109/>

In 1927, Schweppes acquired from the Burrows family Pewtress Spring, in Colwall, on the western side of the Herefordshire Beacon, approximately two miles from Colwall village.<ref name=cokecce/><ref name=Schweppes&MalvernWater/> The source emerges at the fault line between the [[Silurian]] thrust and the [[Precambrian]] [[diorite]] and [[granite]] above it.<ref name=cokecce/> The spring was renamed Primeswell Spring, and in 1929 Schweppes commenced bottling.<ref name=AboutColwall/><ref name=Schweppes&MalvernWater/> Today the factory employs 25 people who bottle 26 million bottles annually.<ref name="CCStewardshipAward"/> It is operated by Coca-Cola Enterprises Ltd., and the water continues to be sold under the Schweppes brand name.<ref name=CokeMalvernWater/>

==Interest groups==
[[File:Malvern Link spout.jpg|thumb|150px|The Temperance Fountain (built1900),  in Malvern Link, dressed in April 2010.]]
Among the interest groups promoting the legacy of Malvern water, the two primary ones are The Malvern Spa Association, and The Friends of Malvern Springs and Wells. 

The Malvern Spa Association (MSA) is a [[non-profit organisation]], founded in September 1998,<ref name= "SpringRestorationProject"/> with two primary aims. "To conserve, protect and restore the Springs, Wells, Spouts and Fountains of the Malvern Hills", and "to promote the study, conservation, development and awareness" of them, and of "Great Malvern as a Spa Town".<ref name=MalvernSpaAssoc/> Apart from various fundraising activities and membership fees, the MSA receives funding through the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]],<ref name=MalvernSpaAssocHomepage/> which is managed by the Malvern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Unit (Malvern Hills AONB),<ref name=MalvernHillsAONBAnnReport/> under the umbrella of the National Association for Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (NAAONB).<ref name=NAAONB/> The Malvern Hills AONB also provides grants via such mechanisms as the Sustainable Development Fund.<ref name=MalvernHillsAONBAnnReport/> The MSA was originally founded by the Spa Water Strategy Working Group, comprising Malvern town councillors and artist Rose Garrard.<ref name= "SpringRestorationProject"/> Its patrons are [[Richard Hill, 7th Baron Sandys|Lord and Lady Sandys]],<ref name=MalvenGazette021109/> after whose family a  spout  located in  Spring Lane, Malvern Link is named, and which was restored in 2005 as part of the  Malvern heritage Project.<ref name=LordSandysSpout/> In  2004, in order to finance improvements and resotration to 20 historical sites,  a grant of <U+00A3>270,000 was awarded by the Heritage Lottery Fund.<ref name= "SpringRestorationProject"/><ref name=MalvernSpaAssoc/> The MSA produces a free newsletter available at the Tourist Information Centre in Great Malvern, at St Ann's Well and for download.<ref name=MalvernSpaAssocNews/> 

The Friends of Malvern Springs and Wells is an informal  group that publishes a newsletter and promotes interest in the wells, including an award scheme for conservation or renovation of springs and wells and their immediate environment.<ref name=FoMSWwebsite/> The award scheme is the ''St Werstan Award for the Enhancement of Water Heritage'', given in honour of [[St. Werstan]], one of the earliest saints associated with Malvern.<ref name=StWerstanAwards/> In  August 2008,  the group's St Werstan award for conservation or renovation of the springs and wells and their surroundings was presented to Coca-Cola Great Britain.<ref name="CCStewardshipAward"/> At the behest of the Friends, the company is also sponsoring a project to transfer an iconic mulberry tree sapling from Melbourne, Australia. The sappling derives from a cutting taken from a mulberry tree originally planted in 1936 by George Bernard Shaw at the Malvern Festival. The tree was destroyed in a storm in 2000, but research by members of the Friends group revealed that in 1956, a cutting from the tree was sent to Malvern in Victoria, Australia.<ref name=GBShawsMulberryTree/> The Friends group also assists in the general maintenance of wells and spouts, and in organising events and [[well dressing]] ceremonies. According  to research made by local historians, a tradition of well dressing  in the Malverns dates from the 12th and 13th centuries when  around 5  August each  year, tribute was paid to [[St Oswald]] for water cures.<ref name="WellDressing"/> The tradition of well dressing continues, fostered by interest groups and activities such as arts projects. 
{{-}}
== Art projects == 
[[File:The Malvinha Fountain - geograph.org.uk - 6372.jpg|thumb|150px|The ''Malvinha'' Fountain in the town centre, a sculpture by artist Rose Garrard.]]
In 1996 the [[Malvern Hills (district)|Malvern Hills District Council]] appointed a Malvern Spa Water Strategy Working Group. Independently, in June 1996, sculptor [[Rose Garrard]] proposed to the MHDC the creation of a sculpture trail by nationally known sculptors, placed at forgotten springs around the town centre. The council began with the installation of new water features as part of its plan to beautify the town centre. In 1997 the District Council implemented a ''Spring Water Arts Project'' to map water sources around the hills.<ref name="WellDressing"/> Garrard undertook a two month long artist's residency and collaborated with the public, who provided locations of over two hundred water sources. Garrard was commissioned to create the drinking spout, ''Malvhina'', which was unveiled on 4 September 1998.<ref name=MalvernSpaAssocMembershipForm/><ref name=MalvernGazette160603/> 

[[File:Enigma Fountain Malvern.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The ''Enigma'' water feature in the town centre, part of a group by Rose Garrard. The statue of Edward Elgar is visible on the right.]]
On 26 May 2000, the ''Enigma Fountain'', also by Garrard, was unveiled by [[Prince Andrew]].<ref name="MalvernSpaAssocEnigmaFountain"/> Its cost of <U+00A3>5,000 was funded by the Malvern Hills District Council, public subscription, and support from by Severn Trent Water, West Midlands Arts, and local businesses.<ref name="MalvernSpaAssocEnigmaFountain"/>  Located on the Bellevue Terrace island in the very centre of the town, together with the statue of Edward Elgar,<ref name=MalvernGazette160603/> the group of sculptures embodies both music and water, the two major aspects of Malvern's cultural history.<ref name=MalvernGazette30Apr2007/>

Art projects continue in various ways. Each year in  April a well dressing competition is organised  around a theme set by  the Malvern Springs Association, with Gold, Silver and Bronze awards presented to  adult's and children's groups.<ref name="WellDressing"/> The well dressing  initiative usually  takes place over a period of four or five days with  the Malvern spouts starting  the annual  season  of well  dressing  around the country in the Derbyshire tradition.<ref name=WellDressingCalendar2010/> In 2003, photographer Bob Bilsland gave persmission  to  the [[BBC]]  to  publish 21 of his special panaoramic  views of the  decorated wells and spouts.<ref name=BBCPanoramicPics/>
[[File:Well dressing in Malvern.jpg|thumb|150px|Children dressing  the spout at  Great  Malvern railway station  for the  2010 competition.]]
For the 2010 competition based on 'Celebrations', a group of pupils of a local primary school decorated the Great Malvern Railway Station Trough with paper figures representing famous people who have visited Malvern,  such as Shaw and Elgar, celebrating  150 years of the railway in the town.<ref name=MalvernGazette04May2010/> Also in 2010, the connection of Florence Nightingale with Malvern water is being celebrated with the help of the [[Malvern Museum]]'s school poster competition.<ref name=MalvernGazette21June2010/>

Other art projects encapsulate different connections with Malvern water. In 2002 the Elmley Foundation donated an 8 foot  water clock designed by French sculptor, and horologist [[Bernard Gitton]].  to the Malvern theatre and the people of Malvern.  The clock which is on permanent exhibition in the foyer area of the theatre represents the three main industries of the town:  its science, theatre, and water.<ref name=MTVisualArts/>
