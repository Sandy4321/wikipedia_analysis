{{lowercase|title=alt.tv.simpsons}}<!--Do NOT add a linebreak here please-->
'''alt.tv.simpsons''' (called "'''a.t.s.'''" by regular readers) is a [[usenet]] [[newsgroup]] dedicated to discussing the [[United States|American]] [[television]] program, ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Created in 1990, the newsgroup became a popular community in the early 1990s, and continues to exist as of 2011.

The newsgroup is known for reviewing the episodes and nitpicking on minor details on the show. The writers of ''The Simpsons'' know about the forum and have on several occasions read the comments made on it; the character [[Comic Book Guy]] is often used in the show to lampoon and respond to the newsgroups fans. 

In interviews some writers have admitted that they do not like being scrutinized, but other writers have participated in the discussions on the forum. Nevertheless, independent commentators<U+2019> calls the forum an example of an "active audience" and have claimed ''The Simpsons'' is tailor-made for such a forum.

== History ==
The newsgroup was created by Gary D. Duzan during the third week of March 1990, four months after the first airing of a regular episode of the program, which was the episode "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]" <U+2013> a Christmas special that aired on December 17, 1989.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snpp.com/guides/lisa-1.html#1.1 |title=alt.tv.simpsons Basic History|accessdate=2009-02-26 |author=Hocking,Tammy; Matt Rose  |date=2004-03-17|publisher=[[The Simpsons Archive]]}}</ref> The newsgroup was created before there was a [[world wide web]], which emerged in 1993, so those earliest discussions were held on text-only platforms.<ref name="tossell">{{cite news |last=Tossell |first=Ivor |title=Worst.

In that period it became a popular community on the Internet.<ref>Turner, p. 39</ref> According to [[Brian Reid (computer scientist)|Brian Reid]], a computer scientist who has been tracking newsgroup traffic since 1985, alt.tv.simpsons was the most popular television newsgroup in May 1994, ahead of a discussion newsgroups about general television newsgroup (rec.arts.tv), [[Monty Python]] (alt.fan.monty-python), the ''[[Late Show With David Letterman]]'' (alt.fan.letterman) and [[soap opera]]s (rec.arts.tv.soaps). Since there is no official method for measuring newsgroup traffic, the list is considered unofficial.<ref>{{cite news |first=Rob |last=Owen |coauthors= |title=Researcher compiles net newsgroup ratings|work=Richmond Times-Dispatch  |page=F-4 |date=1994-07-02|accessdate=2009-02-21}}

== Discussions ==
From its inception, users would use the newsgroup to discuss the quality of the episode, as well as to talk about continuity errors and trivia.<ref name="tossell"/> They would also discuss cultural references, usually related to pop culture. Another common topic is freeze frame gags, which are jokes that can only be seen when the viewer tapes the episode and freezes the image.<ref name="turner285">Turner, p. 285</ref> All of these many discussions were compiled and submitted to [[The Simpsons Archive]], which contains at least 330 episode guides as well as other guides.<ref name="tossell"/> The newsgroup also provides The Simpsons Archive with information on the characters and the setting, as well as a compilation of articles about the show and interview with its cast and crew.<ref>Turner, p. 287</ref>

Among the most frequent topics of discussion are the real-life location of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], the sexuality of [[Waylon Smithers]]<ref>Turner, p. 289</ref> and "[[Who Shot Mr. Burns?]]", a two-episode publicity stunt in which Mr. Burns was shot by an unknown character.<ref name="Oakley">{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2005|title=Commentary for the episode "Who Shot Mr. Burns (Part One)". The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The writers inserted many secret clues into the episode and implemented a contest in which whoever first discovered the shooter would be animated on an episode of the show.<ref name="Mirkin">{{cite video | people=Mirkin, David|date=2005|title=Commentary for the episode "Who Shot Mr. Burns (Part One)".

Due to contest regulations, a winner had to be selected out of a random sample of entries. The sample did not contain any correct answers, so the winner who was chosen did not have the right answer and was paid a cash prize in lieu of being animated.<ref name="Mirkin"/>

==Relationship with the writers==
[[File:Alt.nerd.obsessive.png|thumb|right|The writers often use the character [[Comic Book Guy]] to satirise and respond to the alt.tv.simpsons community. In this scene he is logging on to alt.nerd.obsessive, a parody of alt.tv.simpsons.]]
The writers of the show are aware of the newsgroup and sometimes make jokes at its expense. Within the series, the character Comic Book Guy is often used to represent a stereotypical inhabitant of alt.tv.simpsons.<ref name="tossell"/> 
The first such instance occurred in the seventh season episode "[[Radioactive Man (The Simpsons episode)|Radioactive Man]]," in which Comic Book Guy is logging on to his favorite newsgroup alt.nerd.obsessive.<ref>Turner, p. 282</ref> Comic Book Guy's oft-repeated catchphrase, "Worst episode ever," first appeared on alt.tv.simpsons in an episode review<ref name="Worst Episode Ever">{{cite web|title=I&STM|url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.tv.simpsons/msg/44d7c1808394313f?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safe=off&q=%22worst+episode+ever|last=Donald|first=John R.|work=alt.tv.simpsons|publisher=Google Groups|date=1992-11-04|accessdate=2009-02-21}}</ref> and [[David X. Cohen|David S. Cohen]] decided to use this fan response to lampoon the passion and the fickleness of the fans.<ref name="cohen"/>

The [[The Simpsons (season 8)|eighth season]] episode "[[The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show]]" is largely seen as a satire of the "hardcore fans" that make up the newsgroup, as well as a response to the viewer backlash and obsession with internal consistency those fans commonly express.<ref name="Worst Episode Ever" /> When Comic Book Guy sees the Poochie episode, he immediately goes on the Internet and writes, <U+201C>Worst episode ever<U+201D> on a message board; a commentary on how the active audience nit picks the episode. The writers respond by using the voice of [[Bart Simpson]]:<ref name="alberti">Alberti, pp. 147-148</ref>

{{Quote|
Comic Book Guy: Last night's Itchy & Scratchy was, without a doubt, the worst episode ever. Rest assured I was on the Internet within minutes registering my disgust throughout the world.<br>
Bart: Hey, I know it wasn<U+2019>t great, but what right do you have to complain?<br>
Comic Book Guy: As a loyal viewer, I feel they owe me.<br>
Bart: What? They<U+2019>re giving you thousands of hours of entertainment for free. What could they possibly owe you? If anything, you owe them.<br>
Comic Book Guy: Worst episode ever.
|David S. Cohen|"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show", ''The Simpsons''}} 

The catchphrase further appears in the [[The Simpsons (season 11)|eleventh season]] episode "[[Saddlesore Galactica]],"<ref>{{cite episode |title=Saddlesore Galactica|episodelink=Saddlesore Galactica|series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Tim Long|Long, Tim]]; [[Lance Kramer|Kramer, Lance]]|network=Fox |airdate=February 6, 2000|season=11 |number=13}}</ref> and as the title of the [[The Simpsons (season 12)|twelfth season]] episode "[[Worst Episode Ever]]." <ref>{{cite episode |title=Worst Episode Ever|episodelink=Worst Episode Ever|series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Larry Doyle (writer)|Doyle, Larry]]; [[Matthew Nastuk|Nastuk, Matthew]]|network=Fox |airdate=4 February 2001|season=12 |number=11}}</ref> The catchphrase can also be used for describing other things by saying, "Worst. (Noun). Ever."<ref name="tossell"/>

The writers also use the newsgroup to test how observant the fans are. In the seventh season episode "[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]", the writer of segment Homer<sup>3</sup>, David S. Cohen, deliberately inserted a false equation into the background of one scene.<ref name="cohen">{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Baker |title=Futurama Is Back! Grab a Can of Slurm and Settle In
 |work=[[WIRED]] |date=2007-11-27|accessdate=2009-02-22|quote= |url=http://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/magazine/15-12/ff_futurama?currentPage=2 }}</ref> The equation that appears is ''1782<sup>12</sup> + 1841<sup>12</sup> = 1922<sup>12</sup>''. Although a false statement, it appears to be true when evaluated on a typical calculator with 10 digits of precision. If it were true, it would disprove [[Fermat's last theorem]], which had just been proven when this episode first aired. Cohen generated this "Fermat near-miss" with a computer program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu/~sjg/futurama/dxcinterview.html|title=A Futurama Math Conversation with David X. Cohen|author=Greenwald, Sarah|publisher=[[Appalachian State University]]|date=2005-04-06|accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref> After the episode aired, Cohen lurked on the newsgroup to see the response; at first there was astonishment when users tested it, but later there was despair when they found out it was only accurate to eight decimal places when expressed in [[scientific notation]].<ref name="cohen"/>

==Reception==
The comments of alt.tv.simpsons have been quoted or cited in the writings of mass media commentators. This has led to situations in which relations between writers and viewers have become strained. In 1994, ''Simpsons'' creator Matt Groening acknowledged he and the other show runners have been reading the newsgroup and in frustration said, "Sometimes I feel like knocking their electronic noggins together".<ref>Turner, p. 290</ref> In another case, writer [[Ian Maxtone-Graham]] made comments about the fans on the Internet in an interview with ''[[The Independent]]'', calling them "beetle-browed" and saying, "That's why they're on the Internet and we're writing the show."<ref name="theindependent">{{cite news| title=Behind Every Homer Is a Very Tall Man | work=[[The Independent]] | last=O'Sullivan | first=Charlotte | date=1998-06-22}}</ref>   Writer [[Bill Oakley]] used to respond to select ''Simpsons'' fans through e-mail in a friendly manner,<ref name="salon">{{cite news| title=Worst episode ever | work=[[Salon.com]] | url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/tv/feature/2000/01/24/simpsons/ | last=Weinman | first=Jaime J. | date=2000-01-24 |accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref> but by 1996 claimed "[t]here are people who take it seriously to the point of absurdity".<ref name="timeout">{{cite news| title=Family Fortunes | work=[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] | last=Davies | first=Laura Lee | date=1996-09-25 }}</ref> In a 1994 ''[[Life in Hell]]'' cartoon [[Matt Groening]] implied that he read the newsgroup.<ref name="groening">{{Comic strip reference | cartoonist=Groening, Matt | strip=[[Life in Hell]] | date=1994-10-28 | syndicate=Acme Features Syndicate}}</ref>

In the chapter "Who Wants Candy" in the book ''[[Leaving Springfield]]'', Robert Sloane finds alt.tv.simpsons an example of an "active audience ... who struggle to make their own meaning out of the show". He mentions that in this context, the fans nitpick the show to an extreme and allow no room for error, where the writers believe that nitpicking leads to an under appreciation of the show's qualities.<ref name="alberti"/> Chris Turner writes in the book ''[[Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation|Planet Simpson]]'' that ''The Simpsons'' appeared tailor-made for a newsgroup in the early 1990s because it includes minor details that reward attentive viewing and can be easily scrutinized.<ref name="turner285"/>
