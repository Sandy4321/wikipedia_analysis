'''Mahmud Nedim Pasha''' (c. [[1818]]-[[1883]]) was a [[Turkey|Turkish]] statesman. He was the son of [[Nejib Pasha]], ex-governor-general of [[Baghdad]]. After occupying various subordinate posts at the [[Porte]] he became under-secretary of state for foreign affairs, governor-general of [[Syria]] and [[Smyrna]], minister of commerce, and governor-general of [[Tripoli]]; minister successively of justice and of marine (1869); [[grand vizier]] from [[1871]] to [[1872]] and from [[1875]] to [[1876]].

He was high in favour with Sultan [[Abd-ul-Aziz]] and fell much under the influence of General [[Nicholas Pavlovich Ignatiev|Ignatiev]], the forceful [[Russia]]n ambassador  before the war of 1877-78, his subserviency to Russia earning for him the nickname of "Nedimoff". His administration was most unsuccessful from every point of view, and he was largely responsible for the issue of the decree suspending the interest on the Turkish funds. He was minister of the interior from [[1879]] to [[1883]].
