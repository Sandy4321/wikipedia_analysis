'''Trimecaine''' ([[systematic name]] ''(2,4,6-trimethylphenylcarbamoylmethyl)diethylammonium chloride'', [[chemical formula]] C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>25</sub>ClN<sub>2</sub>O) is an [[organic compound]] used as a [[local anesthetic]] and [[heart|cardial]] [[Antiarrhythmic agent|antiarrhythmic]]. It is white [[crystal]]line powder readily [[solubility|soluble]] in [[water]] and [[ethanol]].<ref name=lekopis>[http://www.lekopis.cz/Kap_6_1_Trimecaini_hydrochloridum.htm Trimecaini hydrochloridum - <U+010C>esk<U+00FD> l<U+00E9>kopis 1997]</ref> It is an active ingredient in products available under trademarks Mesdicain, Mesocain, Mesokain and others.<ref name=ec>[http://www.eurochem.cz/polavolt/org/abecedne/t/popisy/trimekain.htm Trimekain]</ref>

==History==
Trimecaine is probably a [[Czechs|Czech]] discovery (in light of complex pharmacological and clinical evaluation and practical deployment) although its preparation was published by [[Nils L<U+00F6>fgren|L<U+00F6>fgren]] in 1946.<ref name=ec />

==Action mechanism, pharmacokinetics==
Like other local anesthetics belonging in the [[amide]] group trimecaine decreases the [[cell membrane]] permeability, causes depolarization and shortens the [[action potential]].<ref name=zc>[https://www.zdravcentra.sk/cps/rde/xchg/zcsk/xsl/3141_17832.html Antiarytmika (Nov<U+00E1>k, M.)]</ref> Anesthetic effect starts in 15 minutes and remains 60<U+2013>90 minutes. Its [[biological half-life]] is ca. 90 minutes. 10% of trimecaine is excreted unchanged (90% as its metabolites). It passes through the [[Blood-brain barrier|hematoencephalic]] and [[placenta|placental barrier]]s.<ref name=op>[http://www.operativa.cz/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=134 MESOCAIN - Operativa]</ref>

==Indication==
Trimecaine has two main application fields. The first one is [[local anesthesia]] (topical, infiltrational, topical mucosal and inhalational, spinal and Bier's intravenous). It is used in concentrations 0.4 up to 4%, in some cases (e.g. in [[stomatology]]) in mixtures with [[adrenaline]]. The other field is prophylaxis and therapy of ventriculous [[arrhytmia]] on [[myocardial infarction]] and in [[cardiosurgery]]. It is used also for prophylaxis of sympathic reaction during [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]]l [[intubation]]s.<ref name=zc /><ref name=op />

==Contraindication==
Trimecaine must not be used at hypersensitivity on amide anesthetics, [[hypervolemia]], [[hypotension]], cardial conduction defects, [[asystole]], [[cardiogenic shock]] and malignant [[hyperthermia]] in [[Medical history|anamnesis]].<ref name=zc /><ref name=op />

==Adverse effects==
Rarely [[allergy|allergical]] reactions may occur (from dermal or mucosal symptoms to [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic shock]]). At overdosing a toxical reaction arises - excitation, [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[dishevelment]], visual defects, buzzing in ears, [[muscle]] thrill to [[tremor]], in more severe cases [[somnolence]], [[hyporeflexia]], breathing defects to [[apnea]], [[convulsions]].<ref name=zc /><ref name=op />
