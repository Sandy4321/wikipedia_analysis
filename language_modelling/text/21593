'''.au''' is the [[Internet]] [[country code]] [[top-level domain]] ([[ccTLD]]) for [[Australia]].

==History==
The domain name was originally allocated by [[Jon Postel]], operator of [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] to [[Kevin Robert Elz]] of [[Melbourne University]] in 1986. After an approximately five year process in the 1990s, the Internet industry created a self regulatory body called [[.au Domain Administration]] to operate the domain. It obtained assent from [[ICANN]] in 2001, and commenced operating a new competitive regime for domain registration on [[July 1]], [[2002]]. Since this new regime, any registration has to be ordered via a [[Domain name registrar|registrar]].

== Operation of .au ==
Oversight of ''.au'' is conducted by [[.au Domain Administration]] (auDA). It is a not-for-profit organisation whose membership is derived from Internet organisations, industry members and interested individuals. The organisation operates under the consent of the Australian government which has legislative power to decide the operators of electronic addressing in the country.

Policy for .au is devised by ''policy development panels''. These panels are convened by auDA and combine public input with industry representation to derive policy.

The day-to-day operation of the .au [[domain name registry|registry]] technical facility is tendered out by auDA. The operator from 2002 to 2006 for many of .au's second-level domains is [[AusRegistry]]. 

The registry does not sell direct to the consumer, who must register and maintain their domain name via a [[domain name registrar]]. After the industry's liberalisation in 2002, there is an active competitive market in registrars with a variety of prices and services.

==Registration==
It is not possible to register directly in the second level of .au (such as ''mycompany.au''). The naming rules for .au require registrations under second-level categories that describe a type of entity. ''.com.au'', for example, is designed for commercial entities. This follows a similar
allocation policy to that used in other countries such as the [[.uk|United Kingdom]] and [[.nz|New Zealand]].

=== Second-level domains ===
*.com.au - Commercial entities
*.net.au - Commercial entities (historically only ISPs, but the use has been broadened)
*.org.au - Associations and non-profit organisation (historically only for organisations that did not fit in other categories)
*.edu.au - Educational institutions (see Third-level domains, below)
*.gov.au - Governments and their departments (see Third-level domains, below)
*.csiro.au - [[CSIRO]] (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation)
*.asn.au - Associations and non-profit organisations
*.id.au - Individuals (by real name or common alias)

=== New Second-level domains ===
*.act.au Australian Capital Territory
*.nsw.au New South Wales 
*.nt.au Northern Territory
*.qld.au Queensland
*.sa.au South Australia
*.tas.au Tasmania 
*.vic.au Victoria 
*.wa.au Western Australia

=== Third-level domains ===
The use of ''.gov.au'' and ''.edu.au'' is also split up into further state-based categories. State governments and schools use a domain name that reflect their locale, and these state-based third-level domains are managed independently by the states.

For example, a school in [[Western Australia]] would register ''schoolname'''.wa'''.edu.au'', whereas a [[New South Wales]] government department would use ''deptname'''.nsw'''.gov.au''. Similarly, replacing the bold part of these domains, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] would use '''.vic''', [[Queensland]] would use '''.qld''', [[South Australia]] would use '''.sa''', [[Tasmania]] would use '''.tas''', [[Northern Territory]] would use '''.nt''' and the [[Australian Capital Territory]] would use '''.act'''. However, after a change of internet services in [[Queensland]] State Schools their internet addresses were changed from ''schoolname.qld.edu.au'' to ''schoolname.eq.edu.au''. This is not the case for private schools in [[Queensland]]. Often, URLs can even contain a fourth-level domain: for instance, a NSW public school might have the address ''schoolname.schools.nsw.edu.au''.

auDA has delegated responsibility of the .edu.au domain to [[Australian Information and      Communications Technology in Education Committee]] ([[AICTEC]]), which formed a specialist sub-committee, ''.edu.au Domain Administration Committee'' (eDAC).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.auda.org.au/policies/auda-2004-02/ | title = Application of auDA Published Policies to the edu.au 2LD | year = 2004 | month = 02 | work = [[auDA]] | accessdate = 2007-06-06 }}</ref>

Tertiary institutions are typically exempt from requiring state-based distinctions. For example [[Edith Cowan University]] in Western Australia has a domain address of ''ecu.edu.au'' rather than ''ecu.wa.edu.au'', [[Monash University]] in Victoria uses ''monash.edu.au'' rather than ''monash.vic.edu.au''. This difference can be associated with the states having responsibility for primary and secondary education while the Commonwealth has responsibility for tertiary education.

=== Historic second-level domains ===
Some second-level domain names are no longer actively used. Whilst registrations are [[grandfather clause|grand-fathered]] for some, no new registrations are accepted.

*.archie.au - Host of the [[Archie search engine|Archie]] information service of the early 1990s. Has since been deleted
*.conf.au - Conferences and other short-lived events
*.gw.au - Gateways and miscellaneous [[AARNet]] routing equipment. Has since been deleted
*.info.au - General information
*.otc.au - A mapping domain for [[X.400]] addresses; was obsoleted by telememo.au 
*.oz.au - Historical domain name for Australian sites. Australia's original top-level domain for use in the store-and-forward Internet messaging system [[MHSnet]] was ''.oz''. The top-level domain later officially became ''.au'' and those domains in .oz were moved to .oz.au
*.telememo.au - A mapping domain for [[X.400]] addresses

==Other Australian domain names==
.au is not the only top-level domain name assigned to Australia. Some Australian territories were, for historical reasons, also allocated top-level domains.

*[[.cc]] - [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]
*[[.cx]] - [[Christmas Island]]
*[[.hm]] - [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands|Heard and McDonald Islands]]
*[[.nf]] - [[Norfolk Island]]

As the appropriate authorities were late in recognising the need to manage these, most were registered by entrepreneurs for use as vanity domains unrelated to the locale they serve. .cc, for example, is now operated by [[VeriSign]]. .hm represents a nature preserve with no human inhabitants.
