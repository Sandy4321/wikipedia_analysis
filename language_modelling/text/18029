'''Michael Gino Raso''' (born 7 July 1980) is an Italian [[cricket]]er of Australian origin. He made his debut for the [[Italy national cricket team|Italian national side]] at the [[2010 European Cricket Championship Division One|2010 European Championship]].

Born to Italian parents, Raso played club cricket in [[Far North Queensland]] from an early age, and before debuting for Italy also spent several seasons for English and Scottish club sides during the Australian off-season.<ref>[http://www.crickitalia.org/Info/Oriundi/Michael%20Gino%20Raso%20-%20CV.pdf Michael Gino Raso CV] <U+2013> Federazione Cricket Italiana.
