The '''Crystal Palace Dinosaurs''', also known as '''Dinosaur Court''',  are a series of sculptures of extinct [[animal]]s (including [[dinosaur]]s) and [[mammal]]s in [[Crystal Palace Park]], now in the [[London]] borough of [[Bromley]]. Commissioned in 1852 to accompany the [[Crystal Palace]] after its move from the [[Great Exhibition]] in [[Hyde Park]] and unveiled in 1854, they were the first dinosaur sculptures in the world, pre-dating the publication of [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' by six years. While to varying degrees inaccurate by modern standards,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070930222933/http://www.newstatesman.com/200102260031 | title=A site for saur eyes | author=Smith, Dan | date=26 February 2001 | work=New Statesman | accessdate=7 January 2014}}</ref> the models were designed and sculpted by [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]] under the scientific direction of Sir [[Richard Owen]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/science-of-natural-history/biographies/richard-owen/index.html | title=Natural History Pioneers: Richard Owen | publisher=Natural History Museum | accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref> representing the latest scientific knowledge at the time. The models were classed as [[Listed building|Grade II listed buildings]] from 1973, extensively restored in 2002, and upgraded to Grade I listed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6934908.stm | title=Dinosaurs given protected status | publisher=BBC | date=7 August 2007 | accessdate=7 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/hodge-upgrades-crystal-palace-park-dinosaurs-to-grade-i-status/107596.article | title=Hodge upgrades Crystal Palace Park dinosaurs to Grade I status | publisher=Architects Journal | date=7 August 2007 | accessdate=7 January 2014 | author=Vaughan, Richard}}</ref>

The models represent fifteen [[genus|genera]] of extinct animals, not all dinosaurs. They are from a wide range of geological ages, and include true dinosaurs, [[ichthyosaur]]s, and [[plesiosaur]]s mainly from the [[Mesozoic]] era, and some mammals from the more recent [[Cenozoic]] era.

==History==
[[File:Sydenham studio.jpg|thumb|upright|The dinosaur models under construction at [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]]' studio in [[Sydenham]]]]
Following the closure of the [[Great Exhibition]] in October 1851, [[Joseph Paxton]]'s [[the Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] was bought and moved to [[Sydenham Hill]], South London by the newly formed Crystal Palace Company. The grounds that surrounded it were then extensively renovated and turned into a public park with ornamental gardens, replicas of statues and two new man-made lakes. As part of this renovation, [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]] was commissioned to build the first-ever life-sized models of extinct animals. He had originally planned to just re-create [[extinction|extinct]] [[mammal]]s before deciding on building dinosaurs as well, which he did with advice from [[Richard Owen|Sir Richard Owen]], a celebrated [[biologist]] and [[palaeontologist]] of the time. Hawkins set up a workshop on site at the park and built the models there. The models were displayed on three islands acting as a rough timeline, the first island for the [[Paleozoic]] era, a second for the [[Mesozoic]], and a third for the [[Cenozoic]]. The models were given more realism by making the water level in the lake rise and fall, revealing different amounts of the dinosaurs.<ref>McCarthy, 1994. pp. 13<U+2013>17</ref> To mark the launch of the models, Hawkins held a dinner on New Year's Eve 1853 inside the mould of one of the ''[[Iguanodon]]'' models.<ref>McCarthy, 1994. pp. 19<U+2013>24</ref>

[[File:Crystal palace iguanodon.jpg|thumb|left|The famous banquet in the mould of the Crystal Palace ''[[Iguanodon]]'', New Year's Eve, 1853]]
Hawkins benefited greatly from the public's reaction to the dinosaurs, which was so strong it allowed for the sale of sets of small versions of the dinosaur models, priced at <U+00A3>30 for educational use. But the building of the models was costly (having cost around <U+00A3>13,729) and in 1855, the Crystal Palace Company cut Hawkins's funding.<ref>McCarthy, 1994. pp. 25<U+2013>31</ref> Several planned models were never made, while those half finished were scrapped, despite protest from sources including the Sunday newspaper, ''[[The Observer]]''.<ref>McCarthy, 1994. pp. 32<U+2013>33</ref>

[[File:Iguanodons crystal palace email.jpg|thumb|''Iguanodon'' models in 1995, before restoration, showing previous [[countershading|countershaded]] paint scheme with white undersides]]
With progress in palaeontology, the reputation of the models declined. In 1895, the American fossil hunter [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] scorned the dinosaurs' friends as doing them a great injustice, and spoke angrily of the models.<ref name="Gilbert 1994">McCarthy 1994, p. 85</ref> The models and the park fell into disrepair as the years went by, a process aided by the fire that destroyed the Crystal Palace itself in 1936, and the models became obscured by overgrown foliage. A full restoration of the animals was carried out in 1952 by Victor H.C. Martin,<ref>{{cite book |title=LondonGAP Feb 2011 update | last=Mayor of London | date=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title=(Conservation of the Crystal Palace Dinosaurs) | author=Wyncoll, Keith | journal=Crystal Palace Matters | year=2013 | volume=Summer 2013 | issue=69}}</ref> at which time the mammals on the third island were moved to less well-protected locations in the park, where they were exposed to wear and tear. <!--At one time, a guided tour of the dinosaurs was the only opportunity for the public to view the park.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}--> The limestone cliff was blown up in the 1960s.<ref name="IHBC">{{cite web | url=http://www.ihbc.org.uk/context_archive/75/dinosaurs/dinos.html | title=Supporting Columns: Dinosaurs at Crystal Palace Park | publisher=Institute of Historic Building Conservation (IHBC) | date=July 2002 | accessdate=3 December 2013 | author=Morton, Edward}}</ref>

In 2002, the display was totally renovated. The destroyed limestone cliff was completely replaced using 130 large blocks of [[Derbyshire]] limestone, many weighing over {{convert|1|t}}, rebuilt according to a small model made from the same number of polystyrene blocks.<ref name="IHBC"/> Fibreglass replacements were created for the missing sculptures, and badly damaged parts of the surviving models were recast. For example, some of the animals' legs had been modelled in lead, fixed to the bodies with iron rods; the iron had rusted, splitting the lead open.<ref name="IHBC"/>

==The Dinosaur Park==

Fifteen [[genus|genera]]  of extinct animals, not all dinosaurs, are represented in the park. At least three other genera (''[[Dinornis]]'', a [[mastodon]], and ''[[Glyptodon]]'') were planned, and Hawkins began to build at least the mastodon before the Crystal Palace Company cut his funding in 1855. An inaccurate map of the time shows planned locations of the ''Dinornis'' and mastodon.<ref name="Gilbert 1994"/><ref>McCarthy, 1994. p. 32</ref>

===Palaeozoic era===

The [[Palaeozoic]] era is represented in the park by the model rock exposure showing a succession of beds, namely the [[Carboniferous]] (including [[Coal Measures]] and limestone) and [[Permian]].<ref name=McCarthy46-47>McCarthy, 1994. pp. 46<U+2013>47</ref>

Crystal Palace's two ''[[Dicynodon]]'' models are based on incomplete [[Permian]] fossils found in [[South Africa]], along with Owen's guess that they were similar to [[turtle]]s. There is no evidence of any shelled ''Dicynodon'',<ref>McCarthy, 1994. pp. 48<U+2013>49</ref> and recent more complete fossils show that they looked more like [[Hippopotamus]].

===Mesozoic era===

The [[Mesozoic]] era is represented in the park by the model rock exposure showing a succession of beds, namely the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]], by models of dinosaurs and other animals known from mesozoic fossils, and by suitable vegetation - both living plants and models.<ref name=McCarthy46-47/>

Curiously, it is ''[[Hylaeosaurus]]'', from the Cretaceous of England, not ''Iguanodon'', that most resembles the giant [[iguana]] [[stereotype]] of early ideas of dinosaurs. The model ''Hylaeosaurus'' is depicted much like ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'', as a smallish quadrupedal herbivore with a knobbled armoured back, and spines along its sides. Hawkins's depiction is of a large Iguana-like beast with long sharp spines along its back, which Owen noted were "accurately given in the restoration [by Hawkins, to Owen's instructions, but] necessarily at present conjectural".<ref>McCarthy, 1994. pp. 62<U+2013>63</ref> The head of the ''Hylaeosaurus'' model is a fiberglass replica; the original head is on the ground, on a hill above the ichthyosaur end of the lake.

[[File:Crystal Palace Ichthyosaurus.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Ichthyosaurus]]'']]
The ''[[Ichthyosaurus]]'' models are based on [[Triassic]] or Jurassic fossils from Europe. Though the three ichthyosaurs are partly in water, they are implausibly shown basking on land like [[pinniped|seals]]. Owen supposed they resembled crocodiles or plesiosaurs. Better fossil evidence shows that they have more in common with [[shark]]s, having a dorsal fin and fish-like tail, whereas in Hawkins's models the tail is a flat protuberance from a straight backbone. A further discrepancy is that the models' eyes have exposed bony [[sclerotic ring|sclerotic plates]], Owen conjecturing that with such large eyes they had "great powers of vision, especially in the dusk".<ref>McCarthy, 1994. p. 55</ref> They became one of the three mascots of Crystal Palace Park, along with the ''Iguanodon'' and ''Megalosaurus'' (although ichthyosaurs are not dinosaurs). The models more closely resemble more basic ichthyosaurs such as ''[[Cymbospondylus]]''.<ref>McCarthy, 1994. pp. 54<U+2013>55</ref>

[[Image:Iguanodon Crystal Palace.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Iguanodon]]'']]
The ''[[Iguanodon]]'' models represent fossils from the Jurassic and Cretaceous of Europe. [[Gideon Mantell]] sketched the original fossil, found in Sussex in 1822 by his wife, Mary Ann Mantell, as like a long slender lizard climbing a branch (on four legs), balancing with a whiplike tail; lacking a skull, he conjectured that the thumb bone was a nose horn.<ref>McCarthy, 1994. pp. 10<U+2013>11</ref> The nose horn in particular is used repeatedly in popular textbooks and documentaries about dinosaurs to make fun of Victorian inaccuracies; actually, even in 1854, Owen commented "the horn [is] more than doubtful".<ref>McCarthy, 1994. pp. 66<U+2013>67</ref>

Three ''[[Labyrinthodon]]'' models were made for Crystal Palace, based on Owen's guess that, being amphibian in lifestyle, the Triassic animals might have resembled frogs; he named them Batrachia, from the Greek 'Batrachios', frog. One is smooth skinned and is based on the species "''Labyrinthodon salamandroides''" (''[[Mastodonsaurus jaegeri]]''); the other two were based on "''Labyrinthodon pachygnathus''" (''[[Cylotosaurus pachygnathus]]''). Casts of ''[[Chirotherium]]'' footprints that Owen thought were made by the animals<ref name=BTS10>{{cite journal |last=Bowden |first=A.J. |coauthors=Tresise, G.R.; and Simkiss, W. |year=2010 |title=''Chirotherium'', the Liverpool footprint hunters and their interpretation of the Middle Trias environment |journal=Geological Societ, London, Special Publications |volume=343 |pages=209<U+2013>228 |doi=10.1144/SP343.12}}</ref> were included in the ground around the models.<ref>McCarthy, 1994. pp. 50<U+2013>51</ref>

[[Image:London - Crystal Palace - Victorian Dinosaurs 1.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Megalosaurus]]'']]
Gigantic and visually impressive, the ''[[Megalosaurus]]'' became one of the park's three 'mascot dinosaurs' along with the ''Iguanodon'' and (less so) the Ichthyosaurs. Working from fragmentary evidence from Jurassic fossils found in England, consisting mainly of a hip and femur (thigh bone), with a rib and a few vertebrae, Owen conjectured the animal was quadrupedal; palaeontologists now believe it to have been bipedal (standing like ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]''). The first suggestion that dinosaurs might have been bipedal came in 1858, just too late to influence the model.<ref>McCarthy, 1994. pp. 60<U+2013>61</ref>

[[File:Crystal Palace Teleosaurus.jpg|thumb|The two ''[[Teleosaurus]]'']]
When the models were built, only skulls of the Cretaceous fossil ''[[Mosasaurus]]'' had been discovered in the Netherlands, so Hawkins only built the head and back of the animal. He submerged the model deep in the lake, leaving the body unseen and undefined.<ref>McCarthy, 1994. pp. 76<U+2013>77</ref> The ''Mosasaurus'' at Crystal Palace is positioned in an odd place near the secondary island that was originally a waterfall, and much of it is not visible from the lakeside path.

The three ''[[Plesiosaurus]]'' models represents three species of marine reptile, ''P. macrocephalus'', ''P. dolichoderius'' and ''P. hawkinsii'', from the Jurassic of England. Two of them have implausibly-flexible necks.<ref>McCarthy, 1994. pp. 52<U+2013>53</ref>

Owen noted that the ''[[Pterodactylus]]'' fossils from the Jurassic of Germany had scales, not feathers, and while "somewhat bird-like" they had conical teeth, suggesting they were predatory. The two surviving models are perched on a rock outcrop; there were originally two more 'pterodactyls of the [[Oolite]]'.<ref>McCarthy, 1994. pp. 70, 74<U+2013>75</ref>

Owen correctly identified ''[[Teleosaurus]]'' as slender Jurassic [[Crocodilia]]ns with very long thin jaws and small eyes, inferring from the sediment in which they were found that they were "more strictly marine than the crocodile of the Ganges [the [[gharial]]]."<ref>McCarthy, 1994. pp. 58<U+2013>59</ref>

===Cenozoic era===

[[File:Crystal Palace Anoplotherium.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Anoplotherium]]'' herd]]
''[[Anoplotherium]]'' is an extinct mammal from the [[Eocene]] to [[Oligocene]] epochs, first found near Paris. Hawkins's models draw on Owen's speculation about its [[camel]]-like appearance. They are now thought to be related to [[hippopotamus]] and [[pigs]]). Three models were made, forming a small herd.<ref>McCarthy, 1994. p. 79</ref>

[[File:Crystal Palace Megaloceros.jpg|thumb|''[[Megaloceros]]'']]
''[[Megaloceros]]'' or Irish Elk is a species from the [[Pliocene]] to [[Pleistocene]] epochs in [[Eurasia]]. Hawkins built a family unit of male, female and fawn; the adult male bore antlers made from actual fossil antlers, long since replaced. Moved from the third island, they had fallen into disrepair as they were in a place easily accessible by vandals. With their original but fragile antlers, the Irish Elks were the most accurate of the models; since they are of recent geological age (dying out 11,000 years ago), Hawkins was able to model them on living [[deer]].<ref>McCarthy, 1994. pp. 82<U+2013>83</ref>

The giant ground sloth ''[[Megatherium]]'' is from the Pliocene to Pleistocene epochs in South America, where [[Charles Darwin]] had excavated some fossils in 1835. The model, shown hugging a dead tree, used to be in the children's zoo in Crystal Palace Park, now demolished.<ref>McCarthy, 1994. pp. 80<U+2013>81</ref>

The models of ''[[Palaeotherium]]'' represent an extinct Eocene mammal thought by Cuvier to be [[tapir]]-like. They have suffered the most wear and tear of all of the models, and the standing model no longer looked much like the original made by Hawkins. Prior to the 2002 restoration, they were in such bad shape that they were removed and put into store.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nyder.com/dinos/plate10.html | title=Plate 10: Mammals under repair (1999) | publisher=Nyder | date=2003 | accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref> Some sources state that these models were added at a later date, but an ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' illustration of Hawkins's workshop shows them in the background.<ref>McCarthy, 1994. pp. 12, 78, citing the ''Illustrated London News''. January 1854.</ref> Models of the "fearfully great bird" ''[[Dinornis]]'' of New Zealand (extinct by 1500 AD), and of the extinct elephant-like ''Mastodon'' of the [[Miocene]] and Pliocene of America, were planned for the 'Tertiary Islands' but not completed.<ref>McCarthy, 1994. p. 32</ref>

==In literature and popular culture==

[[Charles Dickens]]'s 1853 novel, ''[[Bleak House]]'', begins with a description of muddy streets, whose primordial character is emphasized by the first ever mention of any dinosaur in a popular work,<ref name="glendening2009">{{cite journal | author=Glendening, J. | year=2009 | title=The World-Renowned ''Ichthyosaurus'': A Nineteenth-Century Problematic and Its Representations | journal=Journal of Literature and Science | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=23-47 | ISSN=1754<U+2013>646X | url=http://www.literatureandscience.org/issues/JLS_2_1/JLS_vol_2_no_1_Glendening.pdf}}</ref> ''Megalosaurus'':

In [[H G Wells]]'s 1906 novel ''[[Kipps]]'', Kipps and Ann visit Crystal Palace and sit "in the presence of the green and gold Labyrinthodon that looms so splendidly above the lake" to discuss their future.
