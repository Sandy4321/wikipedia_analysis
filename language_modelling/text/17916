'''Sixth Avenue''' (officially '''Avenue of the Americas''') is a major [[Avenue (landscape)|avenue]] in [[New York City]]'s borough of [[Manhattan]]. It is a commercial thoroughfare for most of its length, and traverses [[SoHo]], [[Greenwich Village]], [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] and [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Traffic on Sixth Avenue runs northbound.

Sixth Avenue's northern end is at [[Central Park South]], adjacent to the Artists Gate traffic entrance to [[Central Park]] at Center Drive.  The portion of Sixth Avenue running north of Central Park was renamed [[Lenox Avenue (Manhattan)|Lenox Avenue]] in 1887 and co-named Malcolm X Boulevard in 1987, which is sometimes a source of confusion.<ref>"What's in a Street Rename? Disorder", ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 20, 1987. p. B1</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Sixth Avenue, North From 14th Street, New York City.jpg|thumb|250px|Looking north from 14th Street in 1905, with the [[IRT Sixth Avenue Line|Sixth Ave. el]] on the right.]]
Sixth Avenue was laid out in the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]].  

The [[elevated railway|elevated]] [[IRT Sixth Avenue Line]] was constructed on Sixth Avenue in 1878, darkening the street and reducing its real-estate value. The "el" came down in stages, beginning in Greenwich Village in 1938-39.<ref>'WPA Guide to New York City'' (1939) 1984:138</ref>. 

===Sixth Avenue extension===

As originally designed, Sixth Avenue terminated at Carmine Street in Greenwich Village. Proposals to extend the street south from that point, to allow easier to access to lower Manhattan, were discussed by the city's former Board of Aldermen as early as the mid-1860s. <ref name="Times-1877">{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B02E2D9133FE63BBC4A52DFBE66838C669FDE|title=Street Improvements|date=Aug. 12, 1877|work=The New York Times|accessdate=20 June 2010}}</ref>

The extension was carried out in the mid-1920s, to ease traffic in the [[Holland Tunnel]], facilitate construction of the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]] and to connect with [[Church Street (Manhattan)|Church Street]] near its northern end, forming a continuous four-lane through route for traffic from Lower Manhattan. 

Construction of the extension resulted in considerable dislocation to existing residents. One historian said that "ten thousand people were displaced, most of them Italian immigrants who knew no other home in America"<ref>Joyce Gold, ''From Trout Stream to Bohemia: A Walking Guide to Greenwich Village History'' (1988:49)</ref>. The WPA Guide to New York City said that the extension resulted in blank side walls facing the "uninspiring thoroughfare" and small leftover spaces. <ref>''WPA Guide to New York City'' [1939] 1982:138</ref>  Dozens of buildings, including The Church of Our Lady of Pompeii, were demolished.

===Avenue of the Americas===

The avenue's official name was changed to '''Avenue of the Americas''' in September 1945 by the City Council, at the behest of Mayor [[Fiorello La Guardia]]<ref name=NYT1945>"Name of 6th Ave. to Be Changed To the Avenue of the Americas; Council Votes Proposal at Mayor's Request, 12 to 1, After a Debate Rages for 2 Hours --Isaacs Fears Oblivion for Historic Sites", ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 21, 1945. p. 23</ref>. It was felt at the time that the name would provide greater grandeur to a shabby street, <ref name="Barry">{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/2005/09/21/nyregion/21about.html|title=About New York; No Way To Name An Avenue|last=Barry|first=Dan|date=21 September 2005|work=The New York Times|accessdate=20 June 2010}}</ref> and to promote trade with the Western Hemisphere.<ref name="Gonzalez">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/04/nyregion/04avenue.html|title=Few Emblems of Americas Remain on Their Avenue|last=Gonzalez|first=David|date=4 July 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=20 June 2010}}</ref>

After the name change, round street signs were attached to streetlights on the avenue, showing the the national seals of all the nations in the  Western Hemisphere.

Demolition of the el resulted in accelerated commercial development of the avenue in [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]]. Beginning in the 1960s, the avenue was entirely rebuilt above 42nd Street as an all-but-uninterrupted avenue of corporate headquarters housed in glass slab towers of [[International Modernism|International Modernist]] style.  Among the buildings constructed was the [[CBS Building]] at [[52nd Street]], by [[Eero Saarinen]] (1965), dubbed "Black Rock" from its dark granite piers that run from base to crown with a break; this designated New York City [[landmark]] is Saarinen's only [[skyscraper]].

In the mid-1970s, the city "spruced up" the street, including the addition of patterned brick crosswalks, repainting of streetlamps, and new pedestrian plazas. Special lighting, which is rare through most of the city, was also installed.<ref>[http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET%20SCENES/deepsix/deepsix.html deepsixth<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

New Yorkers seldom used the avenue's new name, and the street was signed as both "Avenue of the Americas" and "Sixth Avenue" in recent years. Most of the old round signs with country emblems were gone by the late 1990s, and the ones remaining were showing signs of age.<ref name="Gonzalez"/>

==Notable structures==
