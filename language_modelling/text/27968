'''''Rumours''''' is the eleventh studio album by British-American [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Fleetwood Mac]]. Largely recorded in California during 1976, it was produced by the band with [[Ken Caillat]] and [[Richard Dashut]] and was released on 4 February 1977 by [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The record peaked at the top of both the United States [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' chart]] and the [[UK Albums Chart|United Kingdom Albums Chart]]. The songs "[[Go Your Own Way]]", "[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]", "[[Dreams (Fleetwood Mac song)|Dreams]]", and "[[You Make Loving Fun]]" were released as [[single (music)|singles]]. ''Rumours'' is Fleetwood Mac's most successful release; along with winning the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in [[1978 Grammy Awards|1978]], the record has sold over 45&nbsp;million copies worldwide, making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]]. ''Rumours'' has received diamond certifications in several countries, including the US, Canada and Australia.

The band wanted to expand on the commercial success of the 1975 record ''[[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|Fleetwood Mac]]'', but struggled with relationship breakups before recording started. The ''Rumours'' studio sessions were marked by hedonistic behaviour and interpersonal strife between Fleetwood Mac members; these experiences shaped the album's lyrics. Influenced by pop music, the record's tracks were recorded using a combination of acoustic and electric instruments. The [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] process delayed the completion of ''Rumours'', but was finished by the end of 1976. Following the album's release in 1977, Fleetwood Mac undertook worldwide promotional tours.

''Rumours'' garnered widespread critical acclaim. Praise centred on its production quality and [[harmonies]], which frequently relied on the interplay among three vocalists. The record has inspired the work of musical acts in different genres. Often considered Fleetwood Mac's best release, it has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1970s and the best albums of all time. In 2004, ''Rumours'' was [[remastered]] and reissued with the addition of an extra track and a bonus CD of outtakes from the recording sessions. A three-CD reissue of the album was released by Warner Brothers on 29 January 2013. The set included outtakes of songs and concert tracks the band played while on tour in 1977.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fleetwood-mac-pack-live-favorites-into-rumours-reissue-album-premiere-20130125|title=Fleetwood Mac Pack Live Favorites Into 'Rumours' Reissue&nbsp;<U+2013> Album Premiere|work=Rolling Stone|date=25 January 2013|accessdate=13 March 2013}}</ref>

==Background==
In July 1975, Fleetwood Mac's eponymous [[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|tenth album]] was released to great commercial success, eventually selling over four&nbsp;million copies and reaching No. 1 in 1976. The record's biggest hit single, "[[Rhiannon (song)|Rhiannon]]", gave the band extensive radio exposure. At the time, Fleetwood Mac's line-up consisted of guitarist and vocalist [[Lindsey Buckingham]], drummer [[Mick Fleetwood]], keyboardist and vocalist [[Christine McVie]], bassist [[John McVie]], and vocalist [[Stevie Nicks]]. After six months of non-stop touring, the McVies divorced, ending nearly eight years of marriage.<ref name=RSINT>{{cite journal|title=The True Life Confessions of Fleetwood Mac|author=Crowe, Cameron|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=24 March 1977|issue=235}}</ref> The couple stopped talking to each other socially and discussed only musical matters.<ref name=dvd9min>''Classic Albums'', c. 09:15<U+2013>11:50</ref> Buckingham and Nicks<U+2014>who had joined the band before 1975's ''Fleetwood Mac'', after guitarist [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]] had left<ref>''Classic Albums'', c. 01:25<U+2013>02:35</ref><U+2014>were having an on/off relationship that led them to fight often.

Press intrusions into the band members' lives led to inaccurate stories. Christine McVie was reported to be in hospital with a serious illness, while Buckingham and Nicks were declared the parents of Fleetwood's daughter Lucy after being photographed with her. The press also wrote about a rumoured return of original Fleetwood Mac members [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]], [[Danny Kirwan]], and [[Jeremy Spencer]] for a 10th anniversary tour.<ref name=brunn108>Brunning, p. 108</ref> Despite false reports, the band did not change its line-up, although its members had no time to come to terms with the separations before recording for a new album began.<ref name=dvd9min/> Fleetwood has noted the "tremendous emotional sacrifices" made by everyone just to attend studio work.<ref name=ricky59>Rooksby, p. 59</ref> In early 1976, Fleetwood Mac crafted some new tracks in Florida.<ref>Brackett, p. 118</ref> Founding members Fleetwood and John McVie chose to dispense with the services of their previous producer, [[Keith Olsen]], because he favoured a lower emphasis on the [[rhythm section]].

In February 1976, Fleetwood Mac convened at the [[Record Plant]] in [[Sausalito, California]], with hired [[audio engineer|engineers]] Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut. Production duties were shared by the three parties, while the more technically adept Caillat was responsible for most of the engineering; he took a leave of absence from [[Wally Heider Studios]] in Los Angeles on the premise that Fleetwood Mac would eventually use their facilities.<ref name=SOS>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/aug07/articles/classictracks_0807.htm|title=Classic Tracks: Fleetwood Mac 'Go Your Own Way'|author=Buskin, Richard|work=[[Sound on Sound]]|date=August 2007|accessdate=30 December 2009}}</ref> The set-up in Sausalito included a number of small recording rooms in a large, windowless wooden building. Most band members complained about the studio and wanted to record at their homes, but Fleetwood did not allow any moves.<ref name=dvd11min>''Classic Albums'', c. 11:50<U+2013>12:30</ref> Christine McVie and Nicks decided to live in two condominiums near the city's harbour, while the male contingent stayed at the studio's lodge in the adjacent hills.<ref>''Classic Albums'', c. 31:30<U+2013>32:55</ref> Recording occurred in a six-by-nine-metre room which included a [[3M]] [[multitrack recording|24-track tape machine]], a range of high-quality microphones, and an [[Automated Processes, Inc.|API]] [[mixing console]] with [[equalization filter|550A equalisers]]; the latter were used to control frequency differences or a track's [[timbre]]. Although Caillat was impressed with the set-up, he felt that the room lacked ambience because of its "very dead speakers" and large amounts of [[soundproofing]].<ref name=SOS/>

The record's [[working title]] in Sausalito was ''Yesterday's Gone''.<ref name=ricky60/> Buckingham took charge of the studio sessions to make "a pop album".<ref>''Classic Albums'', c. 20:10<U+2013>21:05</ref> According to Dashut, while Fleetwood and the McVies came from an improvisational [[blues-rock]] background, the guitarist understood "the craft of record making".<ref>''Classic Albums'', c. 04:40<U+2013>05:00</ref> During the formative stages of compositions, Buckingham and Christine McVie played guitar and piano together to create the album's basic structures. The latter was the only classically trained musician in Fleetwood Mac, but both shared a similar sense of musicality.<ref>''Classic Albums'', c. 07:00<U+2013>07:35</ref> When the band [[jam (music)|jammed]], Fleetwood often played his drum kit outside the studio's partition screen to better gauge Caillat's and Dashut's reactions to the music's [[groove (music)|groove]].<ref name=dvda/> [[Sound baffle|Baffles]] were placed around the drums and around John McVie, who played his bass guitar facing Fleetwood. Buckingham performed close to the rhythm section, while Christine McVie's keyboards were kept away from the drum kit. Caillat and Dashut spent about nine days working with a range of microphones and [[instrument amplifier|amplifiers]] to get a larger sound, before discovering they could adjust the sound effectively on the API mixing console.<ref name=SOS/>

As the studio sessions progressed, the band members' new intimate relationships that formed after various separations started to have a negative effect on Fleetwood Mac.<ref name=min7>''Classic Albums'', c. 07:45<U+2013>08:55</ref><ref name=dvdmin12>''Classic Albums'', c. 12:45<U+2013>13:40</ref> The musicians did not meet or socialise after their daily work at the Record Plant.

Following over two months in Sausalito, Fleetwood arranged a ten-day tour to give the band a break and fan feedback. After the concerts, recording resumed at venues in Los Angeles,<ref name=brunn111/> including Wally Heider Studios. Christine McVie and Nicks did not attend most of the sessions and took time off until they were needed to record any remaining vocals. The rest of Fleetwood Mac, with Caillat and Dashut, struggled to finalise the [[overdubbing]] and mixing of ''Rumours'' after the Sausalito tapes were damaged by repeated use during recording; the [[Bass drum|kick]] and [[snare drum]] audio tracks sounded "lifeless".<ref name=SOS/> A sell-out autumn tour of the US was cancelled to allow the completion of the album,<ref name=RSINT/> whose scheduled release date of September 1976 was pushed back.<ref name=brunn110>Brunning, p. 110</ref> A specialist was hired to rectify the Sausalito tapes using a [[oscillator|vari-speed oscillator]].

After the final [[audio mastering|mastering]] stage and hearing the songs back-to-back, the band members sensed they had recorded something "pretty powerful".<ref>''Classic Albums'', c. 50:30<U+2013>51:50</ref>

==Composition==

===Lyrics===
Fleetwood Mac's main writers<U+2014>Buckingham, Christine McVie and Nicks<U+2014>worked individually on specific songs, but sometimes shared lyrics with each other. "The Chain" is the only track that all members, including Fleetwood and John McVie, collaborated on. All songs on ''Rumours'' concern personal, often troubled, relationships.<ref name=dvda/> According to Christine McVie, the fact that the lyricists were extensively focusing on the various separations became apparent to the band only with hindsight.<ref name=dvd6>''Classic Albums'', c. 06:00<U+2013>06:30</ref> "You Make Loving Fun" is about her boyfriend, Fleetwood Mac's lighting director, after she split from John.<ref name=min7/> Nicks' "Dreams" details a breakup and has a hopeful message, while Buckingham's similar effort in "Go Your Own Way" is more pessimistic.<ref>''Classic Albums'', c. 27:50<U+2013>28:10</ref> After a short fling with a New England woman, he was inspired to write "Never Going Back Again", a song about the illusion of thinking that sadness will never occur again once feeling content with life. The lines "Been down one time/Been down two times" are in reference to the lyricist's efforts when persuading the woman to give him a chance.<ref name=dvda/>

"Don't Stop", written by Christine McVie, is a song about optimism. She noted that Buckingham helped her craft the verses because their personal sensibilities overlapped.<ref name=dvda/> McVie's next track, "Songbird", features more introspective lyrics about "nobody and everybody" in the form of "a little prayer".<ref>''Classic Albums'', c. 42:20<U+2013>42:35</ref> "Oh Daddy", the last McVie song on the album, was written about Fleetwood and his wife [[Jenny Boyd]], who had just got back together.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=040MDpb35UUC&pg=PA74#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Making Rumours: The Inside Story of the Classic Fleetwood Mac Album|page=74 |author= Ken Caillat, Steve Stiefel |publisher=John Wiley & Sons|date= 5 Mar 2012 |accessdate=19 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/boyd.htm |title=Jenny Boyd |author=Martin Adelson, Lisa Adelson |work=fleetwoodmac.net  |accessdate=19 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d3hLAAAAYAAJ&q=mick+fleetwood+jenny+remarried+1976&dq=mick+fleetwood+jenny+remarried+1976&hl=en&sa=X&ei=y99IUbPTMMm1PdesgLAB&redir_esc=y |title=Musicians in Tune|author=Jenny Boyd, Holly George-Warren |publisher=Simon & Schuster|date= 1 May 1992 |accessdate=19 March 2013}}</ref>  The band's nickname for Fleetwood was "The Big Daddy".<ref name=dvda/> McVie commented that the writing is slightly sarcastic and focuses on the drummer's direction for Fleetwood Mac, which always turned out to be right. Nicks provided the final lines "And I can't walk away from you, baby/If I tried". Her own song, "Gold Dust Woman", is inspired by Los Angeles and the hardship encountered in such a metropolis.<ref name=dvda>{{Cite video|people = Fleetwood Mac| title = Making of Rumours| medium = DVD-Audio (''Rumours'')| publisher=[[Warner Bros.

===Music===
''Rumours'' is built around a mix of acoustic and electric instrumentation. Buckingham's guitar work and Christine McVie's use of [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Rhodes piano]] or [[Hammond B-3 organ]] are present in all tracks. The record often includes [[stress (music)|stressed]] drum sounds and distinctive percussion such as [[conga]]s and [[maraca]]s. It opens with "Second Hand News", originally an acoustic demo titled "Strummer". After hearing [[Bee Gees]]' "[[Jive Talkin']]", Buckingham and co-producer Dashut built up the song with four audio tracks of electric guitar and the use of chair percussion to evoke [[celtic rock]]. "Dreams" includes "ethereal spaces" and a recurring two [[note (music)|note]] pattern on the bass guitar.<ref name=dvda/> Nicks wrote the song in an afternoon and led the vocals, while the band played around her. The third track on ''Rumours'', "Never Going Back Again", began as "Brushes", a simple acoustic guitar tune played by Buckingham, with snare rolls by Fleetwood using [[Percussion mallet#Brushes|brushes]]; the band added vocals and further instrumental audio tracks to make it more layered.<ref>Caillat 2012, [http://books.google.com/books?id=jN-CKaBhtmEC&pg=PA144 pp. 144<U+2013>145.]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Christopher|date=23 December 2000|title=Surround-Sound Demonstrations Impress Confab Attendees|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|page=44|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TxEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA44}}</ref> Inspired by triple step [[step pattern|dancing patterns]], "Don't Stop" includes both [[acoustic piano|conventional acoustic]] and [[tack piano]]. In the latter instrument, nails are placed on the points where the hammers hit the strings, producing a more percussive sound. "Go Your Own Way" is more guitar-oriented and has a [[four-to-the-floor]] dance beat influenced by [[The Rolling Stones]]' "[[Street Fighting Man]]". The album's pace slows down with "Songbird", conceived solely by Christine McVie using a nine-foot [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] piano.<ref name=dvda/>

Side two of ''Rumours'' begins with "The Chain", one of the record's most complicated compositions. A Christine McVie demo, "Keep Me There",<ref name=dvda/> and a Nicks song were re-cut in the studio and were heavily edited to form parts of the track.<ref>''Classic Albums'', c. 54:10<U+2013>55:40</ref> The whole of the band crafted the rest using an approach akin to creating a [[film score]]; John McVie provided a prominent solo using a [[fretless]] bass guitar, which marked a speeding up in tempo and the start of the song's final third. Inspired by [[R&B]], "You Make Loving Fun" has a simpler composition and features a [[clavinet]], a special type of keyboard instrument, while the rhythm section plays interlocking notes and beats. The ninth track on ''Rumours'', "I Don't Want to Know", makes use of a [[twelve string guitar]] and harmonising vocals. Influenced by the music of [[Buddy Holly]], Buckingham and Nicks created it in 1974 before they were in Fleetwood Mac. "Oh Daddy" was crafted spontaneously and includes improvised bass guitar patterns from John McVie and keyboard blips from Christine McVie.

== Critical reception ==
''Rumours'' has been acclaimed by [[music journalism|music critics]] since its release.

In a retrospective piece, [[Allmusic]]'s [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] gave the album five stars and noted that, regardless of the voyeuristic element, the record was "an unparalleled blockbuster" because of the music's quality; he concluded, "Each tune, each phrase regains its raw, immediate emotional power<U+2014>which is why ''Rumours'' touched a nerve upon its 1977 release, and has since transcended its era to be one of the greatest, most compelling pop albums of all time."<ref name=AMG>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r7402|pure_url=yes}}|title=Rumours: Fleetwood Mac|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=28 December 2009}}</ref> In his five-star review of the album, [[Slant Magazine]]'s Barry Walsh praised Fleetwood Mac for turning romantic dysfunction and personal turmoil into "classic, undying pop".<ref name=slant>{{cite web |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/fleetwood-mac-rumours|title=Fleetwood Mac: Rumours|author=Walsh, Barry|work=[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]|date=19 April 2004|accessdate=28 December 2009}}</ref> In 2007, [[BBC]]'s Daryl Easlea labelled the sonic results as "near perfect", "like a thousand angels kissing you sweetly on the forehead",<ref name=BBC>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/r563|title=Fleetwood Mac: Rumours<U+2014>Review|author=Easlea, Daryl|publisher=BBC  |date=14 December 2007|accessdate=28 December 2009}}</ref> while Patrick McKay of [[Stylus Magazine]] wrote, "What distinguishes ''Rumours''<U+2014>what makes it art<U+2014>is the contradiction between its cheerful surface and its anguished heart.

However you held it up to the light, a glint would catch your eye." Rooksby added that the album "had a commercial set of songs in a melodic soft-rock radio-friendly vein. It had guitar solos that never outstayed their welcome; 'unplugged' acoustic moments of crystal clarity; West Coast breezy harmonies in the grand [[The Beach Boys|Beach Boys]]/[[The Mamas & the Papas|Mamas and Papas]]/[[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] tradition; and three distinctive strong lead voices. It was 12" of soap-opera: given the treatment of the relationship themes, there was something to which everyone could relate." He concluded by saying, "breaking up never sounded so musical".<ref name=complete>{{Cite book| last = Rooksby | first = Rikky | title = The Complete Guide to the Music of Fleetwood Mac | publisher = Omnibus Press | year = 1998| location = [[London]], [[England]] | pages = 106-107 | url = | id = | isbn = 0-7119-6310-X}}</ref>

'''Cassette'''

The original cassette release has a different running order, transposing "Second Hand News" and "I Don't Want to Know".

'''Silver Springs'''

"[[Silver Springs (song)|Silver Springs]]" (4:48), a song written by Nicks, was recorded at the same sessions and intended for inclusion on ''Rumours''. It was eventually released as the [[B-side]] of "[[Go Your Own Way]]" and has been restored to later reissues of the album.

'''2001 reissue'''

The [[DVD-Audio]] version of ''Rumours'' released in 2001 includes "Silver Springs" (Track 6, with "Songbird" relocated to Track 12), and short audio interviews with band members about the making of each song.

'''2004 reissue'''

Warner Bros. released a remastered version in 2004 with "Silver Springs" between "Songbird" and "The Chain". The booklet features additional photography and detailed [[liner notes]]. Rhino Entertainment coupled this disc with a bonus disc of demos, roughs, and outtakes.
