The '''Great Eastern Highway''' is a major road between the [[Western Australia]]n cities of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]]. It is a key route for vehicles accessing the eastern [[Wheatbelt (Western Australia)|wheatbelt]] and the eastern [[Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia|goldfields]].  It also forms the westernmost {{convert|595|km|mi|0}} of the main road transportation link between Perth and the [[Eastern Australia|east coast of Australia]].

The road is mostly a federally funded [[National Highway (Australia)|national highway]] due to its national strategic importance. It is signed as '''National Highway 94''' except for a 9 km stretch between the [[Great Eastern Highway Bypass]] and [[Roe Highway]], and the 40 km section between [[Coolgardie, Western Australia|Coolgardie]] and [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]].  It is also signed as [[Highway 1 (Australia)|Highway 1]] between [[The Causeway]] and [[Morrison Road]], and State Route 51 between Johnson Street, [[Guildford, Western Australia|Guildford]], and [[Roe Highway]]. 

The highway mostly runs in parallel with the [[Mundaring, Western Australia|Mundaring]] to Kalgoorlie water [[Goldfields Water Supply Scheme|pipeline]], which pipes drinking water drawn from  [[Mundaring Weir, Western Australia|Mundaring Weir]] near Perth 600 km east to Kalgoorlie. The highway was sealed by 1954.<ref>[http://www.auslink.gov.au/publications/reports/history.aspx A History of Australian Road and Rail] www.auslink.gov.au, 29 August 2006. Retrieved 17 September 2006. </ref> Two highways spur off Great Eastern Highway at various stages; at Perth's eastern metropolitan boundary the [[Great Southern Highway]] begins, which links Perth to such towns as [[York, Western Australia|York]], [[Brookton, Western Australia|Brookton]], [[Narrogin, Western Australia|Narrogin]], and [[Katanning, Western Australia|Katanning]], and 40km prior to arrival at Kalgoorlie the [[Coolgardie-Esperance Highway]] begins, which serves, among others [[Norseman, Western Australia|Norseman]], [[Esperance, Western Australia|Esperance]], and the [[Eastern Australia|east]] of Australia.

==Greenmount Hill==
Great Eastern Highway is notorious for Greenmount Hill, which is a relatively steep 3 km long hill on Perth's eastern outskirts. 

[[Image:Great Eastern Highway Truck Arrester Bed.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Greenmount Hill [[truck arrester bed]]]]

At Greenmount Hill, the highway rises from the [[Swan Coastal Plain]] to the [[Darling Scarp]] at [[Greenmount, Western Australia|Greenmount]]. The road is a key heavy vehicle route into and out of Perth, and trucks are required to descend the hill at low speed in low gear. Larger trucks are required to stop at the top of the hill and perform a brake check. Extensive signage has been placed on the down-hill side of the hill to alert truck drivers to their obligations.

A multiple fatal accident in late 1993 at the intersection with [[Roe Highway]] occurred where a truck lost control coming down hill and failed to stop. This accident led to the construction of a "[[truck arrester bed]]" near the bottom of the hill.  It has been used in emergencies several times since.

In the 1960s, a railway level crossing in [[Bellevue, Western Australia|Bellevue]] which had been the scene of many accidents was replaced by a bridge which passes over the main [[Eastern Railway (Western Australia)|Eastern Railway]] line.

For a part of the Greenmount Hill route, the Old York Road - named because it had been the [[York Road, Western Australia|York Road]] route in the nineteenth century - runs parallel but at much steeper grades compared to the highway, and rejoins the highway a hundred metres east of [[Chippers Leap]] at the top of the main climb of the hill.

==Greenmount to Sawyers Valley==
Following the sudden rise of Greenmount Hill, the route from the entrance to [[John Forrest National Park]] through to Sawyers Valley has a rising and falling route with a reduced speed limit from previous years.  The reason is that numerous side roads have lower speed limits, and the difference between the highway speed and side road speed was too great in the eyes of transport managers.

The localities of Mahogany Creek and Mundaring are dissected by the highway, and a set of traffic lights at Mundaring have been erected.

==Sawyers Valley to The Lakes==
Due to Perth's urban expansion and the growth in traffic on Great Eastern Highway, the previously two-way section of road between [[Sawyers Valley, Western Australia|Sawyers Valley]] and [[The Lakes, Western Australia|The Lakes]] has been re-aligned and upgraded. The rebuilt section between has deep cuttings and is a dual carriageway, the large borrow pits along the rebuilt section being well away from the highway, but very obvious when viewed from the air.

==The Lakes to Kalgoorlie==
[[Image:Great_Eastern_Highway_Bakers_Hill.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Great Eastern Highway leaving [[Bakers Hill]] for the final section of the Highway to Perth]]

[[Image:Start_Of_Great_Eastern_Highway_in_Kalgoorlie.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Great Eastern Highway Commences here in [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]] at Ochiltree Street for the run to Perth]]

The Highway then heads in a northerly direction with the dual carriageway being reduced to one lane with a speed limit of 110km/h applied nearly all the way except for sections near El Caballo resort, Bakers Hill, The new Clackline Bypass and other towns enroute to Kalgoorlie. The Northam Bypass was built to remove trucks from central Northam and cut travel time by 5-10 minutes by linking a new section with the old sections where Mitchell Avenue and Yilgarn Avenue meets the Highway.

A bushfire on 30 December 2007 in the [[Boorabbin National Park]] between [[Southern Cross, Western Australia|Southern Cross]] and [[Coolgardie, Western Australia|Coolgardie]], which cut off the highway, is now the subject of a coronial inquiry. Three truck drivers died following the Department of Environment and Conservation's decision to open the road at the eastern end. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=146&ContentID=52739|title=DEC caught out by deadly firefront|date=31 December 2007|work=[[The West Australian]]|accessdate=8 May 2009}}</ref>

==Major settlements==
[[File:Northam Airport 2009-03-05.jpg|thumb|Northam airport, at the junction of the Great Eastern Highway with Route 115]]
Towns and settlements along the way to Kalgoorlie-Boulder include [[Northam, Western Australia|Northam]], [[Meckering, Western Australia|Meckering]], [[Cunderdin, Western Australia|Cunderdin]], [[Tammin, Western Australia|Tammin]], [[Kellerberrin, Western Australia|Kellerberrin]], [[Doodlakine, Western Australia|Doodlakine]], [[Merredin, Western Australia|Merredin]], [[Burracoppin, Western Australia|Burracoppin]], [[Bodallin, Western Australia|Bodallin]], [[Moorine Rock, Western Australia|Moorine Rock]], [[Southern Cross, Western Australia|Southern Cross]], [[Yellowdine, Western Australia|Yellowdine]], Boorabbin, [[Bullabulling, Western Australia|Bullabulling]] and [[Coolgardie, Western Australia|Coolgardie]].

==Major Perth Junctions==
[[Image:GTEASTERNHWY.png|thumb|Approximate road distances (in kilometres) of towns along the highway from Perth]]
The Perth section of Great Eastern Highway passes through high density and suburbs, and a vast majority of intersections receive little to no control apart from stop signs. Also noteworthy is the fact that many minor intersections are "one in, one out" intersections, that is, turning across traffic to enter or exit the roadway is not an option. 

The Perth section of the highway discussed in this section runs from [[The Causeway]] interchange in [[Victoria Park, Western Australia|Victoria Park]] to the intersection with Horace Street/Farrall Road in [[Midvale, Western Australia|Midvale]]. The highway then runs through the outer, less urbanised suburbs of Perth, and leaves urban Perth after passing through [[Mundaring, Western Australia|Mundaring]], {{convert|35|km|mi|0}} north east of the Perth CBD by road. It does not technically leave Perth until shortly after reaching the Great Southern Highway junction, {{convert|48|km|mi|0}} north east of the Perth CBD by road.
