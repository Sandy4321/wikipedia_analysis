'''SMS ''Bl<U+00FC>cher''''' ("His Majesty's Ship ''Bl<U+00FC>cher''") was the last [[armored cruiser]] to be built by the [[German Imperial Navy]] (''Kaiserliche Marine''). She was designed to match what German intelligence incorrectly believed to be the specifications of the British {{sclass|Invincible|battlecruiser|6}}s. ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' was larger than preceding armored cruisers and carried more heavy guns, but was unable to match the size and armament of the [[battlecruiser]]s which replaced armored cruisers in the British and German navies. The ship was named for the Prussian [[Field Marshal]] [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl<U+00FC>cher|Gebhard von Bl<U+00FC>cher]], the victor of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815.

''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' was built at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|Kaiserliche Werft]] shipyard in [[Kiel]] between 1907 and 1909, and commissioned on 1 October 1909. The ship served in the [[I Scouting Group]] for the majority of her career, including the early portion of [[World War I]]. She took part in the operation to [[Raid on Yarmouth|bombard Yarmouth]] and the [[raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby]] in 1914.

At the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]] on 24 January 1915, ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' was slowed significantly after being hit by gunfire from the British battlecruiser squadron under the command of Vice Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]]. Rear Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]], the commander of the German squadron, decided to abandon ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' to the pursuing enemy ships in order to save his more valuable battlecruisers. Under heavy fire from the British ships, she was sunk, and British destroyers began recovering the survivors. However, the destroyers were forced to withdraw when a German [[zeppelin]] began bombing them, mistaking the sinking ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' for a British battlecruiser. The number of casualties is unknown, with figures ranging from 747 to around 1,000.

==Design==
German armored cruisers, referred to as ''Gro<U+00DF>e Kreuzer'' (large cruisers), were designed for several tasks. The ships were designed to engage the reconnaissance forces of rival navies, as well as fight in the [[line of battle]].<ref>Staff, p. 3</ref> The earliest [[armored cruiser]], {{SMS|F<U+00FC>rst Bismarck|1896|2}}, was rushed through production specifically to be deployed to China to assist in the suppression of the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in 1900. Subsequent armored cruisers, with the exception of the two {{sclass|Scharnhorst|armored cruiser|4}} ships, served with the fleet in the reconnaissance force.<ref>Gardiner & Gray, p. 142</ref>

The Reichstag authorized funds for ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' on 26 May 1906, along with those for the first two {{sclass|Nassau|battleship|6}}s. Though the ship would be much larger and more powerful than previous armored cruisers, ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' retained that designation in an attempt to conceal its more powerful nature.<ref>Gardiner & Gray, p. 134</ref> The ship was ordered under the provisional name "E". Her design was influenced by the need to match the armored cruisers which Britain was known to be building at the time. The Germans expected these new British ships to be armed with six or eight {{convert|9.2|in|cm|adj=on}} guns.<ref name=H45>Herwig, p. 45</ref> In response, the German navy approved a design with twelve {{convert|21|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns in six twin [[gun turret|turrets]]. This was significantly more firepower than that of the previous {{sclass|Scharnhorst|armored cruiser|4}} of German armored cruisers, which only carried eight 21&nbsp;cm guns.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 52.</ref>  

One week after the final decision was made to authorize construction of ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'', the German naval attache obtained the actual details of the new British ships, called the {{sclass|Invincible|battlecruiser|4}}. In fact, the ''Invincible'' carried eight {{convert|30.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns of the same type mounted on [[battleship]]s. It was soon recognized that these ships were a new type of warship, which eventually came to be classified as the [[battlecruiser]]. When the details of the ''Invincible'' class came to light, it was too late to redesign ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'', and there were no funds for a redesign, so work proceeded as scheduled.<ref>Staff, pp. 3, 4</ref> ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' was therefore arguably obsolete even before her construction started, and was rapidly surpassed by the German navy's battlecruisers, of which the first ({{SMS|Von der Tann||2}}) was ordered in 1907.<ref>Staff, p. 4</ref> Despite this, ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' was typically deployed with the German battlecruiser squadron.<ref name=H45/>{{#tag:ref|Contemporary German naval doctrine called for a scouting group to be made up with at least four large ships, or half a squadron.<ref>Philbin, p. 119</ref><ref>Scheer, p. 13</ref> As the largest non-capital warship in the fleet, ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' was frequently employed as the fourth.|group=Note}} The ship ultimately cost the German government 28,532,000 [[German gold mark|Goldmarks]].<ref name="Groner53"/>

===General characteristics===
''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' was {{convert|161.1|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[Length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|161.8|m|ftin|sp=us|abbr=on}} [[Length overall|long overall]]. The ship had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|24.5|m|ftin|sp=us|abbr=on}}, and with the anti-torpedo nets mounted along the sides of the ship, the beam increased to {{convert|25.62|m|ftin|sp=us|abbr=on}}. ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' had a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|8.84|m|ft|abbr=on}} forward, but slightly less aft, at {{convert|8.56|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The ship [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|15,842|MT|sp=us|link=on}} at her designed weight, and up to {{convert|17500|MT|sp=us}} at maximum displacement. Her hull was constructed with both transverse and longitudinal steel frames, and she had thirteen [[watertight compartment]]s and a [[double bottom]] that ran for approximately 65% of the length of the hull.<ref name="Groner53">Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 53</ref>

Documents from the German naval archives generally indicate satisfaction with ''Bl<U+00FC>cher''{{'}}s minor [[ship motions|pitch]] and gentle motion at sea.<ref name="Groner53"/> However, she suffered from severe [[Ship motions|roll]], and with the rudder [[Rudder#Boat rudders details|hard over]], she heeled over up to 10&nbsp;degrees from the vertical and lost up to 55% of her speed. ''Bl<U+00FC>cher''{{'}}s [[metacentric height]] was {{convert|1.63|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The ship had a standard crew of 41 officers and 812 enlisted men. When she served as a squadron [[flagship]], she was manned by an additional 14 officers and 62 sailors. She carried a number of smaller vessels, including two picket boats, three barges, two [[Launch (boat)|launches]], two [[yawl]]s, and one [[dinghy]].<ref name="Groner53"/>

===Propulsion===
''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' was equipped with three vertical 4-cylinder [[triple expansion engine]]s. Each engine drove a propeller, the center screw being {{convert|5.3|m|in|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} in diameter, while the outer two screws were slightly larger, at {{convert|5.6|m|in|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} in diameter. The ship had a single rudder with which to steer. The three engines were segregated in individual engine rooms. With six marine-type double boilers per room, the ship contained a total of 18 coal-fired boilers. The ship had a designed maximum speed of {{convert|24.5|kn|link=on}}, but during her trials, she achieved {{convert|25.4|kn|abbr=on}}. At a cruising speed of 12&nbsp;knots, ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' could steam for {{convert|6600|nmi|km|-2|sp=us}}. At a speed of 18&nbsp;knots, her range was cut down to {{convert|3250|nmi|km|-2|sp=us}}. The ship was designed to carry {{convert|900|MT|sp=us}} of coal, though voids in the hull could be used to expand the fuel supply to up to {{convert|2510|MT|sp=us}} of coal. Electrical power for the ship was supplied by six turbo-generators that provided up to 1,000&nbsp;[[watt|kilowatts]], rated at 225&nbsp;[[volt]]s.<ref name="Groner53"/> The highest power ever achieved by a reciprocating engine warship was the {{convert|43886|ihp|abbr=on}} produced by ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' on her trials in 1909.<ref>Friedman, p. 91</ref>

===Armament===
''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' was equipped with twelve 21&nbsp;cm SK L/45<ref group=Note>In Imperial German Navy gun nomenclature, "SK" (Schnellfeuerkanone) denotes that the gun is quick firing, while the L/45 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/45 gun is 45 [[Caliber#Caliber_as_measurement_of_length|calibers]], meaning that the gun is 45 times as long as the diameter of its bore.</ref> quick-firing guns in six twin [[gun turret|turrets]], one pair fore and one pair aft, and two pairs in wing turrets on either side of the [[superstructure]]. The guns were supplied with a total of 1,020 shells, or 85 rounds per gun.<ref name="Groner53"/> Each shell weighed 108&nbsp;kg (238&nbsp;pounds), and was 61&nbsp;cm (24&nbsp;in) in length.<ref name="Navweaps21">{{cite web| last = DiGiulian| first = Tony| title = German 21 cm/45 (8.27") SK L/45 | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_827-45_skc05.htm| publisher = Navweaps.com| date = 29 February 2008| accessdate = 29 June 2009}}</ref> The guns could be depressed to &minus;5&nbsp;degrees, and elevated to 30&nbsp;degrees, providing a maximum range of {{convert|19100|m|yd|sp=us|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Groner53"/> Their rate of fire was 4 to 5 rounds per minute.<ref name="Navweaps21"/><ref name=C140>Gardiner & Gray, p. 140</ref>

''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' was also armed with sixteen 8.8&nbsp;cm SK L/45 quick-firing guns, placed in both casemates and pivot mounts. Four of these guns were mounted in casemates near the bridge, four in casemates in the bow, another four in casemates at the stern, and the remaining four were mounted in pivot mounts in the rear superstructure. They were supplied with a total of 3,200 rounds, or 200 shells per gun,<ref name="Groner53"/> and could fire at a rate of 15 shells per minute. Their [[high explosive]] shells weighed 10&nbsp;kg (22&nbsp;lb),<ref name=S6/> and were loaded with a 3&nbsp;kg (6<U+00BD>&nbsp;lb) RPC/12 propellant charge. These guns had a life expectancy of around 7,000 rounds.<ref name="Navweaps15">{{cite web| last = DiGiulian| first = Tony| title = German 8.8 cm/45 (3.46") SK L/45, 8.8 cm/45 (3.46") Tbts KL/45, 8.8 cm/45 (3.46") Flak L/45| url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_88mm-45_skc13.htm| publisher = Navweaps.com| date = 16 April 2009| accessdate = 29 June 2009}}</ref> The guns had a maximum range of {{convert|10700|m|yd|abbr=on}}.<ref name=S6/>

''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' was also equipped with four {{convert|45|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on|adj=on}} torpedo tubes. One was placed in the bow, one in the stern, and the other two were placed on the broadside, all below the waterline. The ship carried a total of 11 torpedoes.<ref name="Groner53"/> The torpedoes carried a {{convert|110|kg|lb|abbr=on}} warhead and had two speed settings, which affected the range. At {{convert|32|kn|abbr=on}}, the weapon had a range of {{convert|2000|m|yd|abbr=on}} and at {{convert|36|kn|abbr=on}}, the range was reduced to {{convert|1500|m|yd|abbr=on}}.<ref name=S6/>

===Armor===
As with other German capital ships of the period, ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' was equipped with [[Krupp cemented armor]]. The armored deck was between {{convert|50|-|70|mm|in|abbr=on}} in thickness; more important areas of the ship were protected with thicker armor, while less critical portions of the deck used the thinner armor.<ref name="Groner53"/> The [[armored belt]] was {{convert|180|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick in the central portion of the ship where machinery, ammunition magazines, and other vitals were located, and tapered to {{convert|80|mm|in|abbr=on}} in less important areas of the hull. The belt tapered down to zero at either end of the ship. Behind the entire length of the belt armor was an additional {{convert|30|mm|in|abbr=on}} of [[teak]]. The armored belt was supplemented by a {{convert|35|mm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo bulkhead]],<ref name="Groner53"/> though this only ran between the forward and rear centerline gun turrets.<ref>Gardiner & Gray, p. 151</ref>

The forward [[conning tower]] was the most heavily armored part of the ship. Its sides were {{convert|250|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick and it had a roof that was 80&nbsp;mm thick. The rear conning tower was significantly less well armored, with a roof that was 30&nbsp;mm thick and sides that were only {{convert|140|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick. The central citadel of the ship was protected by {{convert|160|mm|in|abbr=on}} armor. The main battery turrets were 80&nbsp;mm thick in their roofs, and had 180&nbsp;mm sides. The 15&nbsp;cm turret casemates were protected by 140&nbsp;mm of armor.<ref name="Groner53"/>

''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' was launched on 11 April 1908 and commissioned into the fleet on 1 October 1909. She served as a training ship for naval gunners starting in 1911. In 1914, she was transferred to the [[I Scouting Group]] along with the newer battlecruisers {{SMS|Von der Tann||2}}, {{SMS|Moltke|1910|2}}, and the flagship {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}}.<ref name="Groner53"/>

===Sweep in the Baltic===
The first operation in which ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' took part was an inconclusive sweep into the Baltic Sea against Russian forces. On 3 September 1914, ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'', along with seven [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s of the IV Squadron, five cruisers, and 24 destroyers sailed into the Baltic in an attempt to draw out a portion of the Russian fleet and destroy it. The light cruiser {{SMS|Augsburg}} encountered the armored cruisers [[Russian cruiser Bayan (1911)|''Bayan'']] and [[Russian cruiser Pallada (1911)|''Pallada'']] north of Dag<U+00F6> (now [[Hiiumaa]]) island. The German cruiser attempted to lure the Russian ships back towards ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' so that she could destroy them, but the Russians refused to take the bait and instead withdrew to the [[Gulf of Finland]]. On 9 September, the operation was terminated without any major engagements between the two fleets.<ref>Halpern, p. 185</ref>

===Bombardment of Yarmouth===
{{Main|Raid on Yarmouth}}
On 2 November 1914, ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'', along with the battlecruisers ''Moltke'', ''Von der Tann'', and ''Seydlitz'', accompanied by four [[light cruiser]]s, left the Jade Estuary and steamed towards the English coast.<ref name="Tarrant30">Tarrant, p. 30</ref> The flotilla arrived off [[Great Yarmouth]] at daybreak the following morning and bombarded the port, while the light cruiser [[SMS Stralsund|''Stralsund'']] laid a minefield. The British submarine [[HMS D5|''D5'']] responded to the bombardment, but struck one of the mines laid by ''Stralsund'' and sank. Shortly thereafter, Hipper ordered his ships to turn back to German waters. On the way, a heavy fog covered the [[Heligoland Bight]], so the ships were ordered to halt until visibility improved and they could safely navigate the defensive minefields. The armored cruiser {{SMS|Yorck||2}} made a navigational error that led her into one of the German minefields. She  struck two mines and quickly sank; only 127 men out of the crew of 629 were rescued.<ref name="Tarrant30"/>

===Bombardment of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby===
{{main|Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby}}
Admiral [[Friedrich von Ingenohl]], commander of the German High Seas Fleet, decided that another raid on the English coast should be carried out in the hopes of luring a portion of the [[Grand Fleet]] into combat where it could be destroyed.<ref name="Tarrant30" /> At 03:20 [[Central European Time|CET]] on 15 December 1914, ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'', ''Moltke'', ''Von der Tann'', the new battlecruiser {{SMS|Derfflinger||2}}, and ''Seydlitz'', along with the light cruisers ''Kolberg'', ''Strassburg'', ''Stralsund'', ''Graudenz'', and two squadrons of torpedo boats left the Jade estuary.<ref name="Tarrant31">Tarrant, p. 31</ref> The ships sailed north past the island of Heligoland, until they reached the Horns Reef lighthouse, at which point the ships turned west towards Scarborough. Twelve hours after Hipper left the Jade, the High Seas Fleet, consisting of 14 [[dreadnought]]s and 8 [[pre-dreadnought]]s and a screening force of 2 armored cruisers, 7 light cruisers, and 54 torpedo boats, departed to provide distant cover for the bombardment force.<ref name="Tarrant31" />

On 26 August 1914, the German light cruiser {{SMS|Magdeburg||2}} had run aground in the [[Gulf of Finland]]; the wreck was captured by the Russian navy, which found code books used by the German navy, along with navigational charts for the North Sea. These documents were then passed on to the Royal Navy. [[Room 40]] began decrypting German signals, and on 14 December, intercepted messages relating to the plan to bombard Scarborough.<ref name="Tarrant31" /> The exact details of the plan were unknown, and it was assumed that the High Seas Fleet would remain safely in port, as in the previous bombardment. Vice Admiral Beatty's four battlecruisers, supported by the 3rd Cruiser Squadron and the [[1st Light Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Light Cruiser Squadron]], along with the [[2nd Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|2nd Battle Squadron]]'s six dreadnoughts, were to ambush Hipper's battlecruisers.<ref name="Tarrant32">Tarrant, p. 32</ref>

During the night of 15 December, the main body of the High Seas Fleet encountered British destroyers. Fearing the prospect of a nighttime torpedo attack, Admiral Ingenohl ordered the ships to retreat.<ref name="Tarrant32" /> Hipper was unaware of Ingenohl's reversal, and so he continued with the bombardment. Upon reaching the British coast, Hipper's battlecruisers split into two groups. ''Seydlitz'', ''Moltke'', and ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' went north to shell Hartlepool, while ''Von der Tann'' and ''Derfflinger'' went south to shell Scarborough and Whitby. Of the three towns, only Hartlepool was defended by coastal artillery batteries.<ref name="Tarrant33">Tarrant, p. 33</ref> During the bombardment of Hartlepool, ''Seydlitz'' was hit three times and ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' was hit six times by the coastal battery. ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' suffered minimal damage, but 9 men were killed and another 3 were wounded.<ref name="Tarrant33" /> By 09:45 on the 16th, the two groups had reassembled, and they began to retreat eastward.<ref> Scheer, p. 70</ref>

[[Image:Scheer's illustration of I SG disposition 16 Dec. 1916 en.SVG|thumb|300px|The High Seas Fleet's disposition on the morning of 16 December|alt=Map showing the locations of the British and German fleets; the German light cruisers pass between the British battleship and battlecruiser forces while the German battlecruisers steam to the northeast. The German battleships lie to the east of the other ships.]]

By this time, Beatty's battlecruisers were in position to block Hipper's chosen egress route, while other forces were en route to complete the encirclement. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the II&nbsp;Scouting Group began to pass through the British forces searching for Hipper.<ref name="Tarrant34"> Tarrant, p. 34</ref> One of the cruisers in the [[2nd Light Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|2nd Light Cruiser Squadron]] spotted ''Stralsund'' and signaled a report to Beatty. At 12:30, Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships. Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper's ships, but the battlecruisers were some {{convert|50|km|nmi|sp=us}} ahead.<ref name="Tarrant34" /> The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been screening for Beatty's ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions.<ref group="Note">Beatty had intended to retain only the two rearmost light cruisers from [[William Goodenough|Goodenough's]] squadron, but [[HMS Nottingham (1913)|''Nottingham'']]'s signalman misinterpreted the signal, thinking that it was intended for the whole squadron, and thus transmitted it to Goodenough, who ordered his ships back into their screening positions ahead of Beatty's battlecruisers.</ref> This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape.<ref name="Tarrant34" />

Both the British and the Germans were disappointed that they failed to effectively engage their opponents. Admiral Ingenohl's reputation suffered greatly as a result of his timidity. The captain of the ''Moltke'' was furious; he stated that Ingenohl had turned back "because he was afraid of eleven British destroyers which could have been eliminated ... Under the present leadership we will accomplish nothing."<ref name="Tarrant35">Tarrant, p. 35</ref> The official German history criticized Ingenohl for failing to use his light forces to determine the size of the British fleet, stating: "He decided on a measure which not only seriously jeopardized his advance forces off the English coast but also deprived the German Fleet of a signal and certain victory."<ref name="Tarrant35" />

===Battle of Dogger Bank===
{{Main|Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)}}
[[File:SMS Blucher2.PNG|right|thumb|''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' underway|alt=A light gray warship steaming at high speed; thick black smoke pours out of the two funnels.]]
In early January 1915, it became known to the German naval command that British ships were conducting reconnaissance in the [[Dogger Bank]] area. Admiral Ingenohl was initially reluctant to attempt to destroy these forces, because the I Scouting Group was temporarily weakened while ''Von der Tann'' was in drydock for periodic maintenance. Rear Admiral ({{lang-de|Konteradmiral}}) [[Richard Eckermann]], the Chief of Staff of the High Seas Fleet, insisted on the operation, and so Ingenohl relented and ordered Hipper to take his battlecruisers to the Dogger Bank.<ref name="Tarrant36">Tarrant, p. 36</ref>

On 23 January, Hipper sortied, with ''Seydlitz'' in the lead, followed by ''Moltke'', ''Derfflinger'', and ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'', along with the light cruisers ''Graudenz'', ''Rostock'', ''Stralsund'', and ''Kolberg'' and 19 torpedo boats from V Flotilla and II and XVIII Half-Flotillas. ''Graudenz'' and ''Stralsund'' were assigned to the forward screen, while ''Kolberg'' and ''Rostock'' were assigned to the starboard and port, respectively. Each light cruiser had a half-flotilla of torpedo boats attached.<ref name="Tarrant36" />

Again, interception and decryption of German wireless signals played an important role. Although they were unaware of the exact plans, the cryptographers of Room 40 were able to deduce that Hipper would be conducting an operation in the Dogger Bank area.<ref name="Tarrant36" /> To counter it, Beatty's [[1st Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Battlecruiser Squadron]], Rear Admiral Archibald Moore's [[2nd Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|2nd Battlecruiser Squadron]] and Commodore [[William Goodenough]]'s [[Grand Fleet#2nd Light Cruiser Squadron|2nd Light Cruiser Squadron]] were to rendezvous with Commodore [[Reginald Tyrwhitt]]'s [[Harwich Force]] at 08:00 on 24 January, approximately {{convert|30|nmi|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the Dogger Bank.<ref name="Tarrant36" />

At 08:14, ''Kolberg'' spotted the light cruiser {{HMS|Aurora|1913|2}} and several destroyers from the Harwich Force.<ref name="Tarrant38">Tarrant, p. 38</ref> ''Aurora'' challenged ''Kolberg'' with a searchlight, at which point ''Kolberg'' attacked ''Aurora'' and scored two hits. ''Aurora'' returned fire and scored two hits on ''Kolberg'' in retaliation. Hipper immediately turned his battlecruisers towards the gunfire, when, almost simultaneously, ''Stralsund'' spotted a large amount of smoke to the northwest of her position. This was identified as a number of large British warships steaming towards Hipper's ships.<ref name="Tarrant38" /> Hipper later remarked:

<blockquote>
The presence of such a large force indicated the proximity of further sections of the British Fleet, especially as wireless intercepts revealed the approach of 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron ... They were also reported by ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' at the rear of the German line, which had opened fire on a light cruiser and several destroyers coming up from astern ... The battlecruisers under my command found themselves, in view of the prevailing [East-North-East] wind, in the windward position and so in an unfavourable situation from the outset ...<ref name="Tarrant38" />
</blockquote>

Hipper turned south to flee, but was limited to {{convert|23|kn|km/h}}, which was ''Bl<U+00FC>cher''{{'s}} maximum speed at the time.<ref group=Note>Throughout the war, the German Navy suffered from a chronic shortage of high-quality coal. As a result, the ships' engines could not operate at maximum performance. For example, at the [[Battle of Jutland]], the battlecruiser {{SMS|Von der Tann}}, which had a maximum speed of {{convert|27.5|kn|abbr=on}}, was limited to {{convert|18|kn|abbr=on}} for a significant length of time due to this problem. See: Philbin, pp. 56&ndash;57</ref> The pursuing British battlecruisers were steaming at {{convert|27|kn|km/h}}, and quickly caught up to the German ships. At 09:52, {{HMS|Lion|1910|2}} opened fire on ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' from a range of approximately 20,000&nbsp;yards (18&nbsp;km); shortly after, {{HMS|Queen Mary||2}} and {{HMS|Tiger|1913|2}} began firing as well.<ref name="Tarrant38" /> At 10:09, the British guns made their first hit on ''Bl<U+00FC>cher''. Two minutes later, the German ships began returning fire, primarily concentrating on ''Lion'', from a range of {{convert|18000|yd|km|1}}. At 10:28, ''Lion'' was struck on the waterline, which tore a hole in the side of the ship and flooded a coal bunker.<ref name="Tarrant39">Tarrant, p. 39</ref> At around this time, ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' scored a hit with a 24&nbsp;cm shell on ''Lion''{{'}}s forward turret. The shell failed to penetrate the armor, but had concussion effect and temporarily disabled the left gun.<ref>Goldrick, p. 263</ref> At 10:30, {{HMS|New Zealand|1911|2}}, the fourth ship in Beatty's line, came within range of ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' and opened fire. By 10:35, the range had closed to {{convert|17500|yd|km|1}}, at which point the entire German line was within the effective range of the British ships. Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to engage their German counterparts.<ref group="Note">Thus, ''Lion'' on ''Seydlitz'', ''Tiger'' on ''Moltke'', ''Princess Royal'' on ''Derfflinger'', and ''New Zealand'' on ''Bl<U+00FC>cher''.</ref>

By 11:00, ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' had been severely damaged after having been pounded by numerous heavy shells from the British battlecruisers. However, the three leading German battlecruisers, ''Seydlitz'', ''Derfflinger'', and ''Moltke'', had concentrated their fire on ''Lion'' and scored several hits; two of her three dynamos were disabled and the port side engine room had been flooded.<ref name=T40>Tarrant, p. 40</ref> At 11:48, [[HMS Indomitable (1907)|''Indomitable'']] arrived on the scene, and was directed by Beatty to destroy the battered ''Bl<U+00FC>cher''. She was already on fire and listing heavily to port; one of the ship's survivors recounted the destruction that was being wrought:

<blockquote>
The shells ... bore their way even to the stokehold. The coal in the bunkers was set on fire. Since the bunkers were half empty, the fire burned merrily. In the engine room a shell licked up the oil and sprayed it around in flames of blue and green ... The terrific air pressure resulting from [an] explosion in a confined space ... roar[ed] through every opening and [tore] its way through every weak spot ... Men were picked up by that terrific air pressure and tossed to a horrible death among the machinery.<ref name=T40/>
</blockquote>

[[Image:Bluecher sinkend.jpg|left|thumb|The sinking ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' rolls over on her side|alt=The burning hull of a ship on its side; water pours from holes punched by enemy projectiles. The keel is splitting from the intense strain.]]
However, this was interrupted due to reports of U-boats ahead of the British ships; Beatty quickly ordered evasive maneuvers, which allowed the German ships to increase the distance from their pursuers.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 40<U+2013>41</ref> At this time, ''Lion''{{'}}s last operational dynamo failed, which reduced her speed to {{convert|15|knots|km/h}}. Beatty, in the stricken ''Lion'', ordered the remaining battlecruisers to "Engage the enemy's rear", but signal confusion caused the ships to target ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' alone.<ref name="Tarrant42"/> She continued to resist stubbornly; ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' repulsed attacks by the four cruisers of the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron and four destroyers. However, the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron flagship, ''Aurora'', hit ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' twice with torpedoes. By this time, every main battery gun turret except the rear mount had been silenced. A volley of seven more torpedoes were launched at point-blank range; these hits caused the ship to capsize at 13:13. In the course of the engagement, ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' had been hit by 70 to 100 large-caliber shells and several torpedoes.<ref name=S180>Schmalenbach, p. 180</ref>

As the ship was sinking, British destroyers steamed towards her in an attempt to rescue survivors from the water. However, the German [[zeppelin]] ''L5'' mistook the sinking ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' for a British battlecruiser, and tried to bomb the destroyers. The destroyers were forced to withdraw.<ref name="Tarrant42"/> Figures vary on the number of casualties. Paul Schmalenbach reported 6 officers of a total of 29 and 275 enlisted men of a complement of 999 were pulled from the water, for a total of 747 men killed.<ref name=S180/> The official German sources examined by Erich Gr<U+00F6>ner stated that 792 men died when ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' sank,<ref name="Groner53"/> while James Goldrick referred to British documents, which reported only 234 men survived from a crew of at least 1,200.<ref>Goldrick, p. 279</ref> Among those who had been rescued was [[Captain at Sea]] (''Kapitan zur See'') Erdmann, the commanding officer of ''Bl<U+00FC>cher''. He later died of pneumonia while in British captivity.<ref name="Tarrant42">Tarrant, p. 42</ref> A further twenty men would also die as prisoners of war.<ref name=S180/>

The concentration on ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' allowed ''Moltke'', ''Seydlitz'', and ''Derfflinger'' to escape.<ref>Tarrant, p. 41</ref> Admiral Hipper had originally intended to use his three battlecruisers to turn about and flank the British ships, in order to relieve the battered ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'', but when he learned of the severe damage to his flagship, he decided to abandon the armored cruiser.<ref name="Tarrant42"/> Hipper later recounted his decision:

<blockquote>
In order to help the ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' it was decided to try for a flanking move ... But as I was informed that in my flagship turrets C and D were out of action, we were full of water aft, and that she had only 200 rounds of heavy shell left, I dismissed any further thought of supporting the ''Bl<U+00FC>cher''. Any such course, now that no intervention from our Main Fleet was to be counted on, was likely to lead to further heavy losses. The support of the ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' by the flanking move would have brought my formation between the British battlecruisers and the battle squadrons which were probably behind.<ref name="Tarrant42"/>
</blockquote>

By the time Beatty regained control over his ships, after having boarded ''Princess Royal'', the German ships had too great a lead for the British to catch them; at 13:50, he broke off the chase.<ref name="Tarrant42"/> Kaiser Wilhelm II was enraged by the destruction of ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' and the near sinking of ''Seydlitz'', and ordered the High Seas Fleet to remain in harbor. Rear Admiral Eckermann was removed from his post and Admiral Ingenohl was forced to resign. He was replaced by Admiral [[Hugo von Pohl]].<ref>Tarrant, p. 43</ref>
