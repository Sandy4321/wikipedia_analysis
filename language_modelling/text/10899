This is a '''list of television episodes''' from the [[British television]] show '''''Press Gang'''''. ''[[Press Gang]]'' was produced by Richmond Film & Television for [[Central Independent Television|Central]], and screened on the [[ITV]] network in its regular weekday afternoon children's strand, ''[[CiTV|Children's ITV]]''.<ref name="evans">{{cite book |first=Jeff |last=Evans |title=The Guinness Television Encyclopedia |publisher=Guinness|year=1995 |pages =423 |isbn= 0851127444}}</ref><ref name="Cornell-gen">[[Paul Cornell]] (1993) "Press Gang" In: {{cite book |last=Cornell |first=Paul. |coauthors=[[Martin Day]], [[Keith Topping]] |title=The Guinness Book of Classic British TV |publisher=Guinness |year=1993 |pages=215<U+2013>8 |id=ISBN 0-85112-543-3}}</ref> All 43 episodes across five series were written by [[Steven Moffat]]. The first episode was transmitted on [[16 January]] [[1989]], and the final transmitted on [[22 May]] [[1993]]. The show gained an adult audience in an early evening slot when repeated on Sundays on [[Channel 4]].<ref name="cornell218">Cornell, p. 218</ref>

The show was based on the activities of the staff of the ''Junior Gazette'', a children's newspaper initially produced by pupils from the local [[comprehensive school]]. The main [[story arc]] was the on-off romance between the newspaper's editor Lynda Day ([[Julia Sawalha]]) and Spike Thompson ([[Dexter Fletcher]]). The other main characters were assistant editor Kenny Phillips ([[Lee Ross (actor)|Lee Ross]]), Sarah Jackson ([[Kelda Holmes]]), the paper's enterprising accountant Colin Matthews ([[Paul Reynolds (actor)|Paul Reynolds]]) and Frazz Davies ([[Mmoloki Chrystie]]).<ref name="Cornell-gen"/>

In June 2007, ''[[The Stage]]'' reported that Moffat and Sawalha are interested in reviving ''Press Gang''. He said: "I would revive that like a shot. I would love to do a reunion episode <U+2014> a grown-up version. I know Julia Sawalha is interested <U+2014> every time I see her she asks me when we are going to do it. Maybe it will happen <U+2014> I would like it to."<ref>{{cite web |title=Steven Moffat wants to bring back <U+2018>Press Gang<U+2019> |work=[[The Stage]] |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2007/06/steven_moffat_wants_to_bring_back_press_gang.php |date=[[2007-06-13]] |accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref>

==Series==
All episodes were released on DVD between 2004 and 2006. [[Network DVD]] released the series in the UK between 2004 and 2005, and Force Entertainment released it in [[Australia]] between 2005 and 2006. Each series was released periodically, culminating in a complete boxed set. The main difference in the packaging of each series was the varying colours of the ''Press Gang'' logo, which matched the disc menu.

==Episodes==
===Series 1===
Most of the episodes in the first and second series had closing voice-overs featuring typically two characters. These are noted with each episode synopsis. The voice-overs were dropped for the third series onwards, as Moffat felt they were not working as well any more.<ref>Steven Moffat & Julia Sawalha  "At Last a Dragon" ''Press Gang: Season 2'' DVD audio commentary</ref> Producer Sandra C. Hastie recalls that Moffat was "extremely angry" that ''[[Drop the Dead Donkey]]'' had adopted the style.<ref name="hastie">"Interface: Sandra Hastie, part 2" ''Breakfast at Czar's'' Issue 2. [Available as a PDF file on the ''Press Gang'' Series 5 DVD]</ref>

The first series established the characters and the style of the series. The first two episodes were directed by [[Colin Nutley]]. However, he was unhappy with the final edit and requested that his name be removed from the credits.<ref name="petford">{{cite web |first=Adrian |last=Petford |title=Press Gang - The Complete Series Guide |url=http://www.yoyo.org/pressgang/pgguide.txt |date=[[1995-12-16]] |accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref> [[Bob Spiers]], who writer Moffat credits as setting the visual style,<ref name="Moffcomm">Steven Moffat & Julia Sawalha, ''Press Gang: Season 2'' DVD audio commentary</ref> made his ''Press Gang'' directorial debut with "One Easy Lesson."

The show addressed its first serious issue in the two part story "How to Make a Killing", in which the team expose shopkeepers who sell [[solvent]]s to underage customers. The penultimate episode, "Monday-Tuesday", sees a character commit suicide after a being rejected from the writing team and told some home truths by Lynda.<ref name="m-t">{{cite episode |title=Monday-Tuesday |series=Press Gang |credits=wr. Steven Moffat, dir. Bob Spiers |network=ITV |airdate=1989-04-03 |season=1 |number=11}}</ref>  However, the series also features many comedic elements, some of which are referred to in later years. Colin's inadvertent attendance at a funeral dressed as a pink rabbit in "A Night In" is referenced in "Something Terrible: Part 2".<ref>{{cite episode |title=Something Terrible: Part 2 |series=Press Gang |credits=wr.

Moffat used the name "David Jefford" again in his 1997 sitcom ''[[Chalk (TV series)|Chalk]]'' to refer to an off-screen pupil.

===Series 2===

Moffat was impressed with [[Lucy Benjamin]]'s performance as Julie, and expanded her character for the second series.<ref name="petford"/> However she had committed herself to roles in the [[LWT]] sitcom ''[[Close to Home (UK TV series)|Close to Home]]'' and ''[[Jupiter Moon]]'', so the character was replaced by Sam Black ([[Gabrielle Anwar]]).<ref name="putp">O'Brien, Stephen.

===Series 3===
The ''Junior Gazette'' is now running commercially, although still under the main ''Gazette'' and still having to answer to Matt Kerr. [[Paul Cornell]] praises the continuity in this series, beginning with Lynda hiccuping in "The Big Hello", a reference to "At Last a Dragon". The same actress (Aisling Flitton) who played a wrong number in "Love and the Junior Gazette" reprised her character for "Chance is a Fine Thing".  "Attention to detail" such as this is, according to Cornell, "one of the numerous ways that the series respects the intelligence of its viewers."<ref>Cornell, p. 217</ref>

===Series 4===
Series three and four were filmed together as one block. However, Lee Ross, who played Kenny, was unable to commit to the second half of the block. Therefore, Kenny has left for [[Australia]].

Cornell remarks that this series is a "strange beast, somewhat cynical, with a tired acceptance of growing up that produced more pain in the drama than previously."<ref name="cornell218"/> It opens with a funeral, and later features the death of one of the central character's father.

===Series 5===
A [[television film]] called "Deadline" was planned. It was set a few years after the series and aimed at a more adult audience. At one stage in 1992, series 4 was intended to be the last, and the movie was proposed as a follow up. However, making of the film fell through when a fifth series was commissioned instead. The idea of the follow up film was several times reconsidered during the 1990s, but every time fell through for various reasons.<ref name="addinfo">{{cite web |last=Newton |first=Matthew |url=http://www.mjnewton.demon.co.uk/tv/pginfo.htm |title=Press Gang Additional Information |work=Newton's Laws of TV |accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref>
