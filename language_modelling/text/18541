"'''We Can't Stop'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Miley Cyrus]], taken from her fourth [[studio album]] ''[[Bangerz (album)|Bangerz]]'' (2013). It was released on June 3, 2013 by [[RCA Records]] as the [[lead single]] from the album. The song was written and produced by [[Mike Will Made It]], P-Nasty, and [[Rock City (production duo)|Rock City]], with additional songwriting provided by Cyrus, [[Doug E. Fresh]], and [[Slick Rick]]. "We Can't Stop" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], and [[Dance music|dance]] song that talks of a house party and [[recreational drug use]].

"We Can't Stop" received mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who appreciated its overall production and originality, but were ambivalent towards its lyrical content. It reached number two on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming her highest-peaking track at the time, and has sold over two million copies in the United States. The song experienced varying success internationally; it reached the peak position in countries including New Zealand, Scotland, and the United Kingdom, and peaked moderately in several national [[record chart]]s in Europe.

An accompanying music video for "We Can't Stop" was released on June 19, 2013. It received generally mixed review from critics, who were divided in their opinions regarding Cyrus' increasingly provocative image. With 10.7 million views in the first twenty-four hours of its release, the clip held the record for having the most views in that time-frame across [[Vevo]] platforms; after reaching 100 million views within thirty-seven days, it also set the record for being the fastest music video to attain a Vevo certification. (Both records were eventually broken by the music video for Cyrus' follow-up single "[[Wrecking Ball (Miley Cyrus song)|Wrecking Ball]]" in September 2013.) "We Can't Stop" was additionally promoted with a highly-controversial performance during the [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards]].

==Background==
[[File:Rihanna Diamonds World Tour 2013.jpg|thumb|150px|"We Can't Stop" was originally written with Rihanna (''pictured'') in mind before being offered to Cyrus.]]
In 2012, Cyrus announced plans to focus on her film career, effectively putting her musical endeavors on hiatus. That year, she appeared in the films ''[[LOL (2012 film)|LOL]]'' and ''[[So Undercover]]''. She was also confirmed as a primary voice actress in the feature film ''[[Hotel Transylvania]]'', but dropped out of the project to coordinate a musical comeback.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/69288/Miley-Cyrus-Drops-Out-Of-Film-Role-To-Make-Pop-Comeback|title=Miley Cyrus Drops Out Of Film Role To Make Pop Comeback|author=Shaun Kitchener|publisher=Entertainmentwise. [[Gigwise]]|date=February 10, 2012|accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref> In January 2013, Cyrus ended her recording contract with [[Hollywood Records]], under which she released the [[studio album]]s ''[[Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus|Meet Miley Cyrus]]'' (2007), ''[[Breakout (Miley Cyrus album)|Breakout]]'' (2008), ''[[Can't Be Tamed]]'' (2010), and the [[extended play]] (EP) ''[[The Time of Our Lives (EP)|The Time of Our Lives]]'' (2009). Later that month, she signed a recording contract with [[RCA Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1536344/miley-cyrus-signs-with-rca-will-work-with-dr-luke-on-new-lp|title=Miley Cyrus Signs With RCA, Will Work With Dr. Luke on New LP|author=Andrew Hampp|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=January 30, 2013|accessdate=January 26, 2014}}</ref> In March, she confirmed that her fourth studio album would be released by the end of 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/1551141/miley-cyrus-my-new-music-is-gonna-shut-everyone-up|title=Miley Cyrus: 'My New Music Is Gonna Shut Everyone Up'|author=Jason Lipshutz|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=March 7, 2013|accessdate=August 25, 2013}}</ref>

Production duo [[Rock City (production duo)|Rock City]] stated that "We Can't Stop" was originally written with recording artist [[Rihanna]] in mind before offering it to record producer [[Mike Will Made It]], who ultimately offered it to Cyrus. They felt that "this could be somebody<U+2019>s first single", and decided against Rihanna because of the commercial success of her track "[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]" in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vibevixen.com/2013/06/vixen-exclusive-songwriting-duo-rock-city-say-miley-cyrus-we-cant-stop-was-meant-for-rihanna/?utm_campaign=twitter&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitter|title=Vixen Exclusive: Songwriting Duo Rock City Say Miley Cyrus<U+2019> <U+2018>We Can<U+2019>t Stop<U+2019> Was Meant For Rihanna|author=Adelle Platon|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|publisher=Vibe Media|date=June 8, 2013|accessdate=January 3, 2014}}</ref> Cyrus commented that "it really just turned out to be perfect and exactly what I wanted, and exactly what I wanted my first sound to be, and my first look to be".<ref name = "Billboardmay192013"/>
