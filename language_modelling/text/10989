'''I Corps''' is a [[corps]] of the [[United States Army]] headquartered in [[Fort Lewis]], [[Washington]]. It is a senior command of [[United States Army Pacific Command]].

Activated in World War I in France, I Corps oversaw US Army divisions as they repelled several major German offensives and led them into Germany. The Corps was deactivated following the end of the war.

Reactivated for service in World War II, the corps took command of divisions in the south [[Pacific]], leading US and [[Australian]] forces as they pushed the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] army out of [[New Guinea]]. It went on to be one of the principal leading elements in the [[Battle of Luzon]], liberating the [[Philippines]]. It then took charge as one of the commanding headquarters in the occupation of Japan.

Deployed to Korea at the start of the [[Korean War]], the corps was one of three corps that remained in the country for the entire conflict, commanding US, British, and South Korean forces through three years of back-and-forth campaigns against North Korean and Chinese forces. Following the end of the war, it remained in Korea for almost 20 years guarding the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]]. Active today, the corps acts as a subordinate headquarters within US Army Pacific, and has also seen deployment in support of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].

==History==
===World War I===
Following the [[United States|American]] declaration of [[war]] on [[Germany]], on April 6, 1917, I Corps was organized and activated on January 15&ndash;20, 1918, in the [[National Army (USA)|National Army]] in [[Neufch<U+00E2>teau, Vosges|Neufch<U+00E2>teau]], [[France]], the first of several corps-sized formations intended to command [[division (military)|divisions]] of the [[American Expeditionary Force]] in [[Europe]] during [[World War I]].<ref name="Lineage">{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/army/001cp.htm |title=Lineage and Honors Information: I Corps|publisher=United States Army Center for Military History |accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref> Assisted by the [[French XXXII Corps]], the headquarters was organized and trained; on January 20, Major General [[Hunter Liggett]] took command.<ref name="corpshistWWI">{{cite web|url=http://www.lewis.army.mil/corps-history-ww1.asp |title=I Corps History: World War I |publisher=I Corps Public Affairs Office |accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref>

In February, the corps consisted of the [[U.S. 1st Infantry Division|1st]], [[U.S. 2d Infantry Division|2nd]], [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|26th]], [[U.S. 32d Infantry Division|32nd]], [[41st Infantry Division (United States)|41st]], and [[U.S. 42d Infantry Division|42nd]] Infantry Divisions. From February to July, 1918, the [[German Army]] launched four major [[Offensive (military)|offensive]]s, attempting to secure victory before the full American forces could be mobilized. The final offensive, started in July 1918, was an attempt to cross the [[Marne]], in the area of [[Chateau-Thierry]], but I Corps and other formations on the American lines held, and the attack was rebuffed.<ref name="corpshistWWI"/>

With the defeat of these German drives, I Corps conducted its first offensive mission, participating in the [[Second Battle of the Marne]] from July 18 until August 6, which resulted in the reduction of the more important salients driven into Allied lines by the German offensives.<ref name="corpshistWWI"/> After a brief period in the defensive sectors of [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] and [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] between August 7 and September 11, the Corps took part in the [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel|St. Mihiel attack]] on September 12, which reduced the German [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] there during the next four days. Then followed another period on the defense in Lorraine as preparations advanced for what was to be the final Allied offensive of the war. On September 26, I Corps troops began the attack northward that opened the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]]. From that day until November 11, 1918 when the war ended, I Corps was constantly moving forward.<ref name="corpshistWWI"/> 

The I Corps [[shoulder sleeve insignia]] was first worn by members of I Corps after approval from the AEF on December 3, 1918, but it was not officially approved until 1922.<ref name="TIOH">{{cite web|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Corps/01%20Corps.htm |title=The Institute of Heraldry: I Corps |publisher=The Institute of Heradry: I Corps |accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref> I Corps continued to train in France, until it was demobilized on March 25, 1919.<ref name="Lineage"/>

During its time in World War I, I Corps commanded the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st]], [[U.S. 2nd Infantry Division|2d]], [[U.S. 3rd Infantry Division|3d]], [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th]], [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th]], [[6th Infantry Division (United States)|6th]], [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|26th]], [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th]], [[32nd Infantry Division (United States)|32d]], [[35th Infantry Division (United States)|35th]], [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th]], [[41st Infantry Division (United States)|41st]], [[43rd Infantry Division (United States)|43d]], [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th]], [[78th Infantry Division (United States)|78th]], [[80th Division (United States)|80th]], [[U.S. 82d Infantry Division|82d]], [[90th Infantry Division (United States)|90th]], [[91st Infantry Division (United States)|91st]], [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92d]] Infantry Divisions at one point or another.<ref name="corpshistWWI"/> Also assigned to the corps were the French 62nd, 167th and 5th Cavalry Divisions.<ref name="corpshistWWI"/>

===World War II===
On August 15, 1927, [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] was reconstituted in the Regular Army. Two months later, on October 13, 1927, the XX Corps was redesignated as I Corps.<ref name="Lineage"/> However, the corps headquarters remained inactive during peacetime, until the US Army's buildup following the outbreak of [[World War II]]. On November 1, 1940, I Corps was reactivated at [[Columbia, South Carolina]].<ref name="Lineage"/> For the next nine months, the corps supervised training and large scale maneuvers for mobilizing Army divisions.<ref name="corpshistWWII">{{cite web|url=http://www.lewis.army.mil/corps-history-ww2.asp |title=I Corps History: World War II |publisher=I Corps Public Affairs Office |accessdate=2009-06-18}}</ref>

==== New Guinea Campaign ====
On July 6, 1942 [[Lieutenant General]] [[Robert L. Eichelberger]] took command of the corps which he would lead through the majority of its service in the war. In the summer of 1942 the corps was ordered to [[Australia]], closing into the area at [[Rockhampton, Queensland|Rockhampton]] on 17 October 1942.<ref name="corpshistWWII"/> This move was to be part of a larger overall offensive in the south Pacific region.<ref>Horner, p. 38.</ref> The corps at this time comprised the 41st and 32nd Divisions, engaged in the defense of [[British New Guinea]], the beginning of the [[New Guinea campaign]].<ref name="Pimlott128">Pimlott, p. 128.</ref> Though the Japanese advanced rapidly at first, a number of factors slowed their progress against the Allied forces. Stubborn resistance from two Australian brigades bought time for I Corps reinforcements to arrive while the terrain proved more difficult than the Japanese had anticipated.<ref>Marston, p. 126.</ref><ref>Wilmott, p. 108.</ref> Supplies, which were already insufficient for the Japanese forces, were shortened even more as Japan's high command diverted them to the [[Guadalcanal]] campaign.<ref>Willmott, p. 111.</ref> The Japanese attack stalled, and once the threat of a Japanese invasion of Australia was abated, I Corps launched and offensive to push back the Japanese.<ref>Horner, p. 39.</ref><ref>Marston, p. 127.</ref> With the 32nd Division and the 163rd Infantry Regiment of the 41st Division, the offensive was launched across the [[Owen Stanley Mountains]] of New Guinea.<ref name="Pimlott128"/> This force, later augmented by the [[Australian 7th Division]], fought the [[Battle of Buna-Gona]], slowly advancing north against a tenacious enemy under harsh weather and terrain conditions.<ref name="Pimlott128"/> Overstretched Japanese forces, low on supplies, were eventually overcome by US and Australian forces.<ref>Horner, p. 40.</ref> Despite being surrounded, trapped, and outnumbered, the Japanese forces continued to fight until they were completely wiped out by Allied forces.<ref>Willmott, p. 110.</ref> [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]], on the north coast of the island, fell on January 22, 1943. The campaign was the first major Allied victory against the Japanese Army, and I Corps received the [[Distinguished Unit Citation]]. This victory marked the turn of the tide in the ground war against Japan.<ref name="corpshistWWII"/> 

[[File:USNHC-Photo SC 264436 Hollandia.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVTs]] head for the invasion beaches at [[Yos Sudarso Bay|Humboldt Bay]], Netherlands New Guinea, during the [[Operations Reckless and Persecution|Hollandia landing]] in the campaign|alt=A harbor with a number of amphibious ships racing from battleships out to sea to the shore]]
After this campaign I Corps returned to Rockhampton, where it was engaged in the training of the Allied forces beginning to arrive in that area for the coming campaigns. From February 1942 until March 1943 I Corps prepared for its next assignment, [[Operation Cartwheel]].<ref name="Pimlott128"/>  That mission was the capture of [[Hollandia]] on the north coast of Dutch New Guinea; the units allocated to the corps for this task were the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th]] and 41st Infantry Divisions.<ref name="Pimlott129">Pimlott, p. 129.</ref> The Task Force established itself ashore after a successful amphibious assault on April 19, 1944. It then began an offensive in that area to remove Japanese forces, before establishing air bases there.<ref name="corpshistWWII"/>  The battle was a vicious one; the jungles and swamps made difficult fighting ground, and it was not until June 6 that the area was secured.<ref name="Pimlott128"/>  The entire [[Japanese 18th Army]] was cut off from its bases by the force. Following this campaign the corps directed the seizure of the island of [[Biak]], which was secured by June 24, to complete the advances necessary for the subsequent invasion of the [[Philippine Islands]]. On August 20 Major General [[Innis P. Swift]] succeeded General Eichelberger as commander of the corps.<ref name="Pimlott129"/>

==== Luzon ====
The corps was assigned to the [[Sixth United States Army]] in preparation for the [[Battle of Luzon|offensive in the Philippines]] from the assets of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the recognized guerrilla units. On January 9, 1945, I Corps successfully landed on the coast of the [[Lingayen Gulf]] in Northern [[Luzon]] with the mission of establishing a base for future operations to the north and of denying the enemy northern access to the [[China Sea]].<ref name="Pimlott206">Pimlott, p. 206.</ref> As a part of the Sixth Army with an overall force of 175,000 men, the American forces faced over 260,000 Japanese in Luzon.<ref name="Horner60">Horner, p. 60.</ref> In a sustained drive of thirty-four days which covered over 100 miles, I Corps crossed central Luzon and thus separated the Japanese forces in the north from those in southern Luzon, destroying Japanese armored units along the way.<ref>Pimlott, p. 207.</ref> Additional landings at [[Samar]] and [[Palawan]] were conducted in February, reducing the pressure on the forces of I Corps.<ref>Willmott, p. 181.</ref> Following this accomplishment, the corps turned northward and began the systematic reduction of the enemy positions on the approach to the [[Cagayan Valley]]. The breakthrough into the valley was followed by a swift exploitation that took the corps to the north coast. This advance covered two hundred miles in little over 100 days; eliminating effective enemy resistance in northern Luzon.<ref name="corpshistWWII"/> [[Manila]] was recaptured by the Allies after heavy fighting that ravaged the city.<ref>Willmott, p. 182.</ref> The intense fighting that ensued cost 8,000 killed and 30,000 wounded in the Sixth Army, compared to 190,000 dead for Japan.<ref name="Horner60"/> As the Sixth Army finished off the Japanese on Luzon, the [[Eighth United States Army]] in the south sent units all throughout the Philippines to eliminate remaining Japanese resistance on the islands.<ref name="Horner60"/> The [[Tenth United States Army]] in the north commenced securing [[Okinawa]] and [[Iwo Jima]].<ref>Horner, p. 61.</ref> With the defeat of the Japanese at each of these places, the US forces had locations from which to launch attacks into mainland Japan.<ref>Willmott, p. 183.</ref>

Allied forces then began preparing for the invasion of mainland Japan, [[Operation Downfall]]. I Corps was assigned as one of four Corps under the command of the Sixth Army, with a strength of 14 divisions.<ref>Marston, p. 229.</ref> I Corps was to lead the assault on [[Miyazaki Prefecture|Miyazaki]], in southern [[Kyushu]], with the 25th, 33rd, and 41st Infantry Divisions.<ref name="Mars230">Marston, p. 230.</ref> Opposing them would be the Japanese 57th Army, with the 154th, 156th, and 212th Japanese Infantry Divisions. Before the assault could be launched, Japan surrendered, following the use of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].<ref>Marston, p. 236.</ref>

During World War II, the 6th, [[8th Infantry Division (United States)|8th]], [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th]], 24th, [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th]], [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th]], 32nd, [[33rd Infantry Division (United States)|33rd]], [[37th Infantry Division (United States)|37th]], 41st, 43d, 77th and [[98th Infantry Division (United States)|98th Infantry Division]]s were assigned to I Corps at one time or another, along with the [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd Marine Division]], 7th Australian Division, and elements of the [[11th Airborne Division]].<ref name="corpshistWWII"/>

==== Occupation of Japan ====
[[File:Sto1001.jpg|thumb|Occupation forces in [[Tokyo]], 1946.|alt=A large Japanese city with American soldiers patrolling the streets]]
After the end of hostilities, I Corps was assigned to [[Occupied Japan|occupation]] duty in Japan. On September 19, 1945 the corps, with the assigned 33rd Infantry Division, sailed from Lingayen Gulf for Japan, landing on the island of [[Honshu]] on September 25, three weeks after Japan's formal surrender.<ref name="corpshistoc">{{cite web|url=http://www.lewis.army.mil/corps-history-occupation.asp |title=I Corps History: Occupation |publisher=I Corps Public Affairs Office |accessdate=2009-06-18}}</ref> The next few years were a period during which the terms of the surrender were supervised and enforced; Japanese military installations and material were seized, troops were disarmed and discharged, and weapons of warfare disposed of. The duties of the occupation force included conversion of industry, repatriation of foreign nationals, and supervision of the complex features of all phases of Japanese government, economics, education, and industry.<ref>Marston, p. 237.</ref>

By 1948, as the purely occupational mission was accomplished, troops of the corps focused more military training and field exercises designed to prepare them for combat. Its force was eventually downsized to the 24th Infantry Division on Kyushu and 25th Infantry Division on mid-Honshu. The US Army continued a slow and steady process of post-war drawdown and demobilization on its own, and on March 28, 1950, the corps was formally inactivated in Japan, and its command consolidated with other units.<ref name="corpshistoc"/>

=== Korean War===
Only a few months later, the [[Korean War]] began, and units from Japan began streaming into [[South Korea]]. The [[Eighth United States Army]], taking charge of the conflict, requested the activation of three corps headquarters for its growing command of U.N. forces. I Corps was reactivated at [[Fort Bragg, North Carolina]], on August 2, 1950.<ref name="Lineage"/>

==== Pusan Perimeter ====
[[File:Naktong Defense.jpg|thumb|defense of the Pusan Perimeter|alt=A map of a perimeter on the southeastern tip of a land mass]]
Advance elements of the headquarters took their place in the [[Pusan perimeter]] on August 27. The headquarters, designated "Task Force Jackson," assumed control of the [[I Corps (South Korea)|South Korean I Corps]], the [[21st Infantry Regiment (United States)|21st Regimental Combat Team]], and the 3rd Battalion Combat Team of the [[9th Infantry Regiment]]. On September 12, under command of Lieutenant General [[Frank W. Milburn]], the corps became operational.<ref name="corpshistorykorea">{{cite web|url=http://www.lewis.army.mil/corps-history-korean.asp |title=I Corps History: Korea |publisher=I Corps Public Affairs Office |accessdate=2009-06-18}}</ref> It took command of the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]], 24th Infantry Division, and [[1st Infantry Division (South Korea)|South Korean 1st Infantry Division]], along with the [[27th British Commonwealth Brigade]], defending the [[Naktong River]] area against attacking North Korean units.<ref>Varhola, p. 86.</ref>

Amphibious [[Battle of Inchon|landings at Inchon]] by [[X Corps (United States)|X Corps]] hit North Korean forces from behind, allowing I Corps and [[IX Corps (United States)|IX Corps]] to break out of Pusan. Four days later I Corps troops pushed northward against crumbling enemy opposition to establish contact with forces of the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] driving southward from the beachhead. Major elements of the North Korean Army were destroyed and cut off in this aggressive penetration; the link-up was effected south of [[Suwon]] on September 26.<ref name="corpshistorykorea"/> The offensive was continued northwards, past [[Seoul]], and across the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]] on October 1. The momentum of the attack was maintained, and the race to the North Korean capitol, [[Pyongyang]], ended on October 19 when elements of the [[1st Infantry Division (South Korea)|South Korean 1st Infantry Division]] and U.S. [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] both entered the city. The advance continued, but against unexpectedly stiffening enemy resistance. On October 25 the first [[China|Chinese]] prisoners on the Eighth Army front were taken by I Corps troops. By the end of October the city of [[Chongju, North Korea|Chongju]], forty miles from the [[Yalu River]] border of North Korea, had been captured.<ref name="corpshistorykorea"/>

==== Chinese Intervention ====
On November 27, China entered the war on the side of North Korea against the UN. Massed Chinese attacks were immediately launched against troops of the corps. The Eighth Army suffered heavy casualties, ordering a complete withdraw to the [[Imjin River]], south of the 38th parallel, having been devastated by the overwhelming Chinese force.<ref name="Var14">Varhola, p. 14.</ref> In the wake of the retreat, the disorganized Eighth Army regrouped and re-formed. I Corps relinquished command of the 1st Cavalry Division, the 24th Infantry Division, and the 27th British Brigade, taking command of the 3rd Infantry Division and the 25th Infantry Division in their place.<ref name="Var87">Varhola, p. 87.</ref> On January 1, 1951, 500,000 Chinese troops attacked the Eighth Army's line at the Imjin River, forcing them back 50 miles and allowing the Chinese to capture Seoul.<ref name="Var14"/> The Chinese eventually advanced too far for their supply lines to adequately support them, and their attack stalled. The Eighth Army, battered by the Chinese assault, began to prepare spring offensives to retake lost ground.<ref>Varhola, p. 15.</ref>

[[File:Americanexecuted1950korea.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Soldier of the 21st Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division captured and executed by North Korean forces, 1950|alt=A soldier's body laying on the ground with his hands tied behind his back]]
Following the establishment of defenses south of the capital city, [[General]] [[Matthew B. Ridgway]] ordered I, IX, and X Corps to conduct a general counteroffensive against the Chinese forces, Operation Thunderbolt.<ref name="Var19">Varhola, p. 16.</ref> Between February and March, the Corps participated in [[Operation Killer]], pushing Chinese forces north of the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]].<ref>Varhola, p. 18.</ref> This operation was quickly followed up with [[Operation Ripper]], which retook Seoul in March.<ref>Varhola, p. 19.</ref> After this, [[Operation Courageous#Operations Rugged and Dauntless|Operations Rugged and Dauntless]] in April saw Eighth Army forces advance north of the 38th parallel and reestablish themselves along the Kansas Line and Utah Line, respectively.<ref name="Var19"/> 

As I Corps troops approached the "Iron Triangle" formed by the cities of [[Chorwon]], [[Kumhwa]], and [[Pyongyang]], Chinese resistance increased.<ref name="corpshistorykorea"/> By that time, the 1st South Korean Infantry Division was relieved from the Corps and assigned to one of the Korean corps. The 1st Cavalry Division was returned to the Corps in its place.<ref name="Var87"/> 

In late April, the Chinese launched a major counterattack.<ref>Malkasian, p. 41.</ref> Though the 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions were able to hold their ground against the Chinese 9th Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) Army Corps, the [[6th Infantry Division (South Korea)|South Korean 6th Infantry Division]], to the east, was destroyed by the 13th CPV Army Corps, which penetrated the line and threatened to encircle the American divisions.<ref>Catchpole, p. 120.</ref> The 1st Marine Division and [[27th British Commonwealth Brigade]] were able to drive the 13th Army Corps back while the 24th and 25th Divisions withdrew on April 25.<ref name="Malk42"/> The line was pushed back to Seoul but managed to hold.<ref name="Malk42">Malkasian, p. 42.</ref>

==== Stalemate ====
[[File:M39-AUV-Korea-19521001.jpg|thumb|South Korean soldiers reinforce defenses along Old Baldy Hill|alt=A group of Korean soldiers building fortifications out of wood]]
In September, the UN Forces launched another counteroffensive with the 24th Infantry Division at the center of the line, west of the [[Hwachon Reservoir]].<ref name="Malk50">Malkasian, p. 50.</ref> Flanked by the South Korean 2nd and 6th Divisions, the 24th advanced past Kumwha, engaging the 20th and 27th CPV Armies.<ref name="Malk50"/> In November, the Chinese attempted to counter this attack, but were unsuccessful. It was at this point, after several successive counteroffensives that saw both sides fighting intensely over the same ground, that the two sides started serious peace negotiations.<ref>Malkasian, p. 53.</ref> In late 1951, the 1st Cavalry Division, depleted after having suffered 16,000 casualties so far in the conflict, was relegated to the Far East reserve to rebuild. It was replaced by the [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th Infantry Division]] of the [[Oklahoma Army National Guard]], which was newly arrived in the theater.<ref name="Var87"/> 

In March 1952, the corps grew in size as the 25th Infantry Division was relieved from its command and it gained command of [[1st British Commonwealth Division]] and the South Korean 1st Division, [[8th Infantry Division (South Korea)|8th Division]], and [[9th Infantry Division (South Korea)|9th Divisions]].<ref name="Var87"/> In June 1952, a ten-day attack against 45th Infantry Division outposts was repulsed.<ref name="corpshistorykorea"/> September 1952 began with renewed enemy attacks against the outposts that protected the main line. Enemy attacks up to regimental size against garrisons of platoon and company strength were turned back by Corps troops. Outposts at Bunker Hill, [[Battle of the Hook|The Hook]], Kelly, [[Old Baldy Hill]], Nori, and [[Battle of Pork Chop Hill|Pork Chop Hill]] were defended in heavy fighting within I Corps' area of responsibility. All along the front, the enemy was driven back with thousands of casualties.<ref name="corpshistorykorea"/>

[[File:Bruce C Clarke.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Lieutenant General Bruce Clarke, last commander of I Corps of the Korean War|alt=An aged Caucasian man in military uniform, with a large number of ribbons and medals]]
In January 1953, the corps underwent its last major reorganization of the war, losing command of the US 3rd, 24th, and 45th Infantry Divisions, the South Korean 8th and 9th Infantry Divisions, and the British 1st Commonwealth Division, while taking command of the US 2nd, 7th, and 25th Infantry Divisions and the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]].<ref name="Var87"/> On 23 January 1953, the first major action of the year was initiated with a raid by aggressive infantrymen of the South Korean 1st Infantry Division against the enemy's Big Nori positions. The next months saw many such raids which harassed the enemy, captured prisoners, and destroyed defensive works. Beginning in March, the Communists continually attacked the corps outposts. In that month, troops on Old Baldy were withdrawn, on orders from I Corps, after suffering heavy casualties from the Chinese. On April 10, 1953 Lieutenant General [[Bruce C. Clarke]], who was to see the corps through the remainder of its combat, assumed command.<ref name="corpshistorykorea"/>  

The fighting on the outposts continued; the 7th Infantry Division stopped wave after wave of troops that the Chinese threw against Pork Chop Hill. Troops of the [[Turkish Brigade]], attached to the 25th Infantry Division, defended Outposts Berlin, Vegas, Carson, and Elko in fierce hand-to-hand combat. They were ordered to evacuate all but the Berlin position at the end of May. The [[1st British Commonwealth Division]] ejected the Chinese after their assault on the Hook. The 1st ROK Division troops were ordered off the positions on Queen, Bak, and Hill 179 when heavy enemy assaults divested them of their tactical value. The closing days of the fighting saw the 7th Infantry Division withdrawn from Pork Chop and the 1st Marine Division ordered to evacuate the Berlin positions for the same reason.<ref name="corpshistorykorea"/>

=== Cold War ===
[[File:Korean dmz map.png|thumb|The Korean DMZ along the 38th parallel|alt=A defensive line in the middle of a landmass]]
After the 1953 armistice, the defense of the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] was handled by the South Korean and American armies. The eastern half of the border was handled by the South Korean Army while I Corps took charge in the west. For the next 18 years, the Corps oversaw US forces on the DMZ, seeing only occasional incidents with the North Korean army.<ref name="Var87"/> In 1971, under Nixon's d<U+00E9>tente policy, the 7th Infantry Division was withdrawn, leaving the 2nd Infantry Division as the only US Army unit in Korea. I Corps remained in Korea as a two-division formation until 1971 when it was reduced to zero strength and was replaced in 1982 by the Third Republic of Korea Army (TROKA).<ref name="Var87"/>

In 1980, [[Fort Lewis, Washington]] was notified of a major change of structure. A corps headquarters was to be activated in March 1982. I Corps was formally activated on 1 October 1981, much earlier than expected.<ref name="Lineage"/> On 1 August 1983, the Corps expanded its operational control of active Army units outside Fort Lewis, to include the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] at [[Fort Ord, California]], and the [[172nd Infantry Brigade (United States)|172nd Infantry Brigade]] in [[Alaska]], which then became part of the [[6th Infantry Division (United States)|6th Infantry Division]].<ref name="corpshistpres">{{cite web|url=http://www.lewis.army.mil/corps-history-present.asp |title=I Corps History: 1980-Present |publisher=I Corps Public Affairs Office |accessdate=2009-06-18}}</ref> In 1988, the [[distinctive unit insignia]] was approved for the corps. This was the fourth design held by the corps, with previous versions being approved then retracted in 1942, 1970, and 1982.<ref name="TIOH"/>

=== Gulf War ===
Following the end of the Cold War in 1989, the US government conducted careful restructuring of national priorities and of the defense establishment. Fort Lewis, ideally located to act as a base for mobilization and power projection into the Pacific region, was one of few military bases that did not downsize with the US military overall. Thus, while most of the Army was downsizing, Fort Lewis began to grow, however, several tenant units such as the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]] were downsized.<ref name="corpshistpres"/>

The 3rd Brigade, 9th Infantry Division became the [[199th Infantry Brigade]], attached to I Corps, remaining under I Corps until its redesignation as the [[2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment]], and its departure for [[Fort Polk, Louisiana]] in 1993.<ref name="corpshistpres"/>
 
Also in 1990, the U.S. intervened in the Middle East with [[Operation Desert Storm]]. During that intervention, Fort Lewis deployed 34 active and 25 reserve component units to Saudi Arabia. I Corps also contributed to the command structure, with the I Corps Commander, LTG [[Calvin A. H. Waller]] and the Deputy I Corps Commander, MG [[Paul R. Schwartz]], assisting General [[H. Norman Schwarzkopf]], the Commander of the American Forces.  I Corps expanded its contingency missions and became a quick-response corps.  For several months, I Corps was the nation's worldwide contingency corps, while the [[XVIII Airborne Corps]] was engaged in the [[Gulf War]].  This caused a good deal of activity on Fort Lewis, as the post restructured itself to support the corps' new mission, and to insure that it had a smooth, rapid departure in case they were needed anywhere in the world. This duty was returned to XVIII Airborne Corps upon its return to the United States. The corps then began to convert to a permanently structured, no-mobilization contingency corps and was placed under the operational control of the Commanding General, [[U.S. Army Pacific Command]] (USARPAC). This entailed the addition of a number of active component corps units.<ref name="corpshistpres"/>

In preparation for these new requirements, Fort Lewis began to receive new corps support units which were coming out of Europe. One of these was the 7th Engineer Brigade which was inactivated on January 16, 1992 and immediately reactivated as the [[555th Engineer Group]]. On February 16, 1992 the [[210th Field Artillery Brigade]], also from Europe, was activated. In 1997, the [[35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade]] moved to [[Fort Bliss, Texas]], to join other air defense brigades. The corps and Fort Lewis would see a reshuffling of units in and out of the area through 2000.<ref name="corpshistpres"/> Plans were drawn up for emergency operations for I Corps should a major conflict emerge in the Pacific region. Plans exist for I Corps to rapidly deploy in defense of [[Japan]] or [[South Korea]].<ref name="GSO"/>

=== War on Terrorism ===
With the events of [[September 11, 2001]], I Corps began providing support for Army units deploying in support of the [[War on Terrorism]]. Its assets were active in providing [[combat support]] and [[combat service support]] missions, including [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in [[Afghanistan]], [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] in [[Iraq]] and the domestic [[Operation Noble Eagle]].<ref name="corpshistpres"/>

On February 4, 2004, I Corps forward headquarters deployed to Iraq. The element, called Task Force Olympia, deployed to [[Mosul]], Iraq in January 2004, where it assumed its mission from the [[101st Airborne Division]] to form a headquarters to exercise command and control of all coalition and Iraqi forces in northern Iraq. It coordinated the efforts of both of the active [[Stryker Brigade Combat Team]]s, attached engineers, civil affairs, signal, and other supporting units as well as Iraqi security forces, eventually numbering more than 12,000. The Iraqi security forces included four Civil Defense Corps battalions, three Border Police battalions, several thousand members of the Iraq Facility Protection Security Forces and an Armed Forces battalion. After more than a year in Iraq, the Corps forward headquarters handed over responsibility for northern Iraq to the soldiers of Task Force Freedom and [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]] in February 2005.<ref name="corpshistpres"/>

In 2008, it was announced that I Corps was to deploy to Iraq in 2009, to replace XVIII Airborne Corps in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Soldiers of the corps trained for a year in preparation for the deployment, which began on April 9, 2009.<ref name="Iraq">{{cite web|url=http://www.mnf-iraq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=26022&Itemid=128 |title=I Corps Soldiers relieve Fort Bragg troops (Baghdad) |publisher=Multi-national Force Iraq Public Affairs Office |accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref> I Corps is currently filling the role of [[Multi-National Corps Iraq]] at [[Al-Faw Palace]].

==Organization==
I Corps is unique among the active US Army corps in that it has no permanently assigned active duty divisions.<ref name="GSO">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/i-corps.htm |title=GlobalSecurity.org: I Corps |publisher=''[[Globalsecurity]]'' |accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref> It is also composed of a mixture of active duty and [[US Army Reserve]] units in 47 of the 50 U.S. States, for a total of around 20,000 active duty and 20,000 army reserve forces.<ref name="GSO"/>
