'''Saint Cainnech of Aghaboe''', (515/516 - 600) was also known as '''Saint Canice''' in [[Ireland]], '''Saint Kenneth''' in [[Scotland]], '''Saint Kenny''' and '''Saint Canicus'''.

Cainnech was a [[Gaels|gaelic]] abbot, monastic founder, priest and missionary during the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval period]]. He wrote a commentary on the [[Gospel| Gospels]], known as ''Chain of Cainnech'' for centuries.<!--FOOTNOTE--><ref name=autogenerated1>{{Harvnb|Herbermann|1913}}.</ref>

Cainnech is one of the [[Twelve Apostles of Ireland]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01632a.htm|title=The Twelve Apostles of Erin}}</ref> and preached [[Christianity]] across [[Ireland]] and to the [[Kingdom of the Picts| Picts]] in [[Scotland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=5907|title=St. Canice (Kenneth) - Catholic Online<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref> Cainnech was considered a man of virtue, great eloquence and learning.

== Introduction ==
Cainnech was born in 515 or 516, at [[Glengiven]], near [[Dungiven]] in [[Ireland]]. He died and was reposed at [[Aghaboe]] in 599/600.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ulster}}.{{Harvnb|O'Donovan|1842}}.</ref> His feast day is commemorated on [[11 October]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=171|title=Catholic Online}}</ref> and on the [[1 August]] or [[14 August]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

A lot of what we know of Cainnech comes from legend. However, he is documented by [[Saint Adomnan| Saint Adomn<U+00E1>n]] (also known as [[Eunan]]), the ninth the abbot of [[Iona]] who died in 704. Adomn<U+00E1>n was a hagiographer and his greatest work ''Vita Columbae'' or ''Life of St. Columba'' contains references to Cainnech.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{Harvnb|Adamnan}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|O'Donovan|1842}}.</ref>

== Cainnech's background ==
[[Image:San canizio kilkenny.jpg|thumb|150px|left| Statue at St. Mary's Cathedral Kilkenny]]

His real name was Cainnech moccu Dal<U+00E1>nn.<ref>Sharpe, Richard, ''Adomn<U+00E1>n of Iona: Life of Saint Columba'', pp. 262&ndash;263. ''Moccu'' is not a patronymic but rather the name of a kin group, in this case the ''Corcu Dal<U+00E1>nn'', in later sources, when it was no longer current, ''moccu'' was sometimes mistakenly read as a patronymic such as ''mac'' or ''mac h-ui''; see Charles-Edwards, T. M., ''Early Christian Ireland'', pp. 96&ndash;100.</ref>

Cainnech's father [[Lughadh Leithdhearg]] was descended from the CorcoDalann or Ui Dalainn, a tribe whose ancestor, Dalann, is traced back to Fergus ([[Kings of Ulster|King of Ulster]]), son of Ross, son of Rudhraighe.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishmidlandsancestry.com/content/laois/community/parishhistories/aghaboe_parish.htm|title=Parish of Aghaboe, Laois- Ancestral Research, Family History, Laois, Offaly, Genealogy<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>
The Corco-Dalann were from an island referred to as "Insula Nuligi", and is usually identified with Inis-Doimhle or Inis-Uladh, which is now the Little Island, in the River [[Suir]], south-east of [[Waterford]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Lughadh was a distinguished [[bard]],a professional highly trained, learned poet. As with many men of the bard class, Lughadh travelled and wandered throughout the country at the time. Lughadh settled at Glengiven, in what is now County Londonderry. Lughadh ended up under the favour and protection of the chief of Cianachta. Lughadh became the tutor of the chieftain's son, Geal Breagach.<ref name=autogenerated4 />

Cainnech's mother was called Maul or Mella. She attained an eminent degree of sanctity. The church of Thompleamoul or Capella Sanctae Maulae seu Mellae, beside Kilkenny city, was dedicated to God under her invocation.<ref name=autogenerated4 />

== Early life ==
[[Image:Clonard RC Church St Finian 07 Detail 2007 08 26.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Finnian of Clonard|St. Finnian]] imparting his blessing to the Twelve Apostels of Ireland]]
Cainnech spent his early years watching his chieftain's flocks.

In [[Early Christian Ireland| early Christian Ireland]] the druid tradition collapsed, with the spread of the new faith. Study of [[Latin]] learning and Christian theology in monasteries flourished. In 543 sensing a higher calling, cainnech became a pupil at the monastic school at [[Clonard Abbey|Clonard]]. During the sixth century, some of the most significant names in the history of Irish [[Christianity]] studied at the Clonard monastery. It is said that the average number of scholars under instruction at Clonard was 3,000.<ref name ="Flood">

</ref> Twelve students who studied under [[Finnian of Clonard| St. Finian]] became known as the [[Twelve Apostles of Ireland]], cainnech was one of these. It was at Clonard that Cainnech became a friend and companion of [[St Colmcille]].

In 544 he was studying in the school of [[Glasnevin]], with [[Ciaran of Clonmacnoise| St. Kieran of Clonmacnoise]] and [[St. Comgall]] of [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]], under the tuition of [[St. Mobhi]].

When plague scattered that community, he went as a monk the monastery of [[Llancarfan]] in [[Glamorganshire]] in [[Wales]], under [[Saint Cadoc]]. He was ordained a priest there in 545.

He left for [[Rome]] to obtain the blessing of the reigning pontiff. In 550 he had returned to Glengiven, where he converted his foster-brother, Geal-Breagach, who afterwards assisted him in founding Drumachose, in nearby [[Limavady]].

== Scotland ==
Cainnech went to Scotland in 565. In [[Scotland]] Cainnech was known as St. Kenneth, and was closely associated with [[St. Columba| St. Columba's]] missionary work.

Adamnan tells of the arrival of Cainnech, on Iona. St. Columba had a prophecy of a "certain holy and excellent man, who will arrive here among us before evening." God had provided Cainnech with a safe and calm crossing, even though the sea was perilous and stormy that day. St. Columba received him that evening with all honour and hospitality.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

Cainnech built a church in the place now known as Saint Andrews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/saintc2w.htm|title=saintc2w.htm<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref> Cainnech name is recalled in the ruins of an ancient church, Kil-Chainnech on [[Tiree]] Island, and in a burial ground, Kil-Chainnech, in Iona.

Cainnech built monastic cells on the island of [[Ibdon]] and [[Eninis]], an oratory called Lagan-Kenny on the shores of [[Loch Laggan]] (the remains of which are marked on the OS map), and a monastery in [[Fife]] on the banks of the Eden.

== Ireland ==
Cainnech spent a good deal of his time in [[County Meath]] and Ossary in what is now [[County Laois]]. In Ossary he had a good repute with the king, [[Colmann son of Feradach]]. Colman gave him grants of land including Aghaboe("the field of the Ox") which became his principle monastery.<ref>{{Harvnb|Baring-Gould|60}}.</ref> He founded a monastery and Abbey of [[Aghaboe]]. Aghaboe grew in importance, and in the 7th century it sent St Feargal as a missionary to the church of Salzburg. Aghaboe become for a time the site of the bishop's see until under Norman influence in the twelfth century the see transferred from Aghaboe to Kilkenny.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicireland.net/pages/index.php?nd=381&art=997|title=CatholicIreland.net<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref> In 1346 Diarmaid Mac Giollaph<U+00E1>draig burned the town of Aghaboe and the cemetery and church, and completely destroyed Cainnech's shrine along with Cainnech's bones and relics.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

[[Image:Kilkenny St. Canice Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|226px|St. Canice's Cathedral Kilkenny.]]
[[Kilkenny]] (Irish: Cill Chainnigh "The Church of Cainnech") was originally the name of a church erected by or dedicated to Cainnech, but was afterwards extended to the townland and parish.<ref>{{Harvnb|ODonovan|1839}}.</ref> Kilkenny was one of the last parts of Ireland to be converted to [[Christianity]]. Tradition asserts that in 597, Cainnech led a Christian force to Kilkenny to eliminate the last bastion of Druidic rule in Ireland. The last Archdruid of Ireland had retired with his Council to a mound in Kilkenny for safety. Cainnech led an army there and overcame them. He founded a monastery near what is now the [[Church of Ireland|Church of Ireland's]] St. Canice's Cathedral.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> St Cainnech of Aghaboe is the secondary patron of Kilkenny.

== Chain of Cainnech ==
In his old age Cainnech retired to an island in Loch Cree, since drained, and wrote a commentary on all four Gospels. This became known as Glass Kinnich (Glas-Chainnigh) or Chain of Cainnech,<ref>{{Harvnb|Baring-Gould|2005|p=60}}.[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/saintc2w.htm].</ref>This was long preserved in his church and became a continuous commentary in the Middle Ages).<ref>{{Harvnb|Walsh|1854|p=496}}</ref>

This is a [[Troparion]] of St Cainnech. <br />
In honour thou dost rank with Ireland's Enlightener, <br />
