'''Geuzen''' ({{IPA-nl|<U+02C8><U+0263><U+00F8><U+02D0>z<U+0259>n}}; [[French language|French]]: '''Les Gueux''', [[English language|English]]: the '''Beggars''') was a name assumed by the confederacy of [[Calvinist]] Dutch nobles and other malcontents, who from 1566 opposed [[Spain|Spanish]] rule in the [[Netherlands]]. The most successful group of them operated at sea, and so were called '''Watergeuzen''' ({{IPA-nl|<U+02C8><U+028B>a<U+02D0>t<U+0259>r<U+02CC><U+0263><U+00F8><U+02D0>z<U+0259>n}}; French: ''Gueux de mer'', [[English language|English]]: '''Sea Beggars'''). In the [[Eighty Years' War]], the [[Capture of Brielle]] by the Watergeuzen in 1572 provided the first foothold on land for the rebels, who would conquer the northern [[Seventeen Provinces|Netherlands]] and establish an independent [[Dutch Republic]]. They can be considered either as [[privateer]]s or [[pirates]], depending on the circumstances or motivations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uB7ODGowJ3AC&pg=PA101 |title=Bandits at sea: a pirates reader - C.

==Origin of the name==
The leaders of the nobles who signed a solemn league known as the [[Compromise of Nobles]], by which they bound themselves to assist in defending the rights and liberties of the Netherlands against the civil and religious despotism of [[Philip II of Spain]] were [[Louis of Nassau|Louis, Count of Nassau]], and [[Henry, Count of Br<U+00E9>derode]]. On April 5, 1566, permission was obtained for the confederates to present a petition of grievances, called the Request, to the regent, [[Margaret of Parma|Margaret, Duchess of Parma]]. About 250 nobles marched to the palace accompanied by Louis of Nassau and Br<U+00E9>derode. The regent was at first alarmed at the appearance of so large a body, but one of her councillors, [[Charles de Berlaymont|Berlaymont]], allegedly remarked "N'ayez pas peur Madame, ce ne sont que des gueux" (fear not madam, they are nothing but beggars).

[[File:Emblem of the Geuzen.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional emblem of the Geuzen.]]
The appellation was not forgotten. At a great feast held by some 300 confederates at the Hotel Culemburg three days later, Br<U+00E9>derode in a speech declared that if need be they were all ready to become beggars in their country's cause. The name became henceforward a party title. The patriot party adopted the emblems of beggarhood, the wallet and the bowl, as trinkets to be worn on their hats or their girdles, and a [[Geuzen medals|medal]] was struck having on one side the head of Philip II, on the other two clasped hands with the motto ''Fid<U+00E8>le au roy, jusqu'<U+00E0> porter la besace'' ("Loyal to the King, up to carrying the beggar's pouch"). The original league of Beggars was short-lived, crushed by [[Fernando <U+00C1>lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Alva]], but its principles survived and were to be ultimately triumphant.

In the [[Dutch language]] the word ''geuzennaam'' is used for [[reappropriation#Linguistic reappropriation|linguistic reappropriation]]: a pejorative term used with pride by the people called that way.

==Sea Beggars==

[[File:Capture of Brielle, April 1 1572 (Frans Hogenberg).jpg|thumb|[[Capture of Brielle]], 1 April 1572 (Frans Hogenberg).]]

In 1569 [[William I of Orange|William of Orange]], who had now openly placed himself at the head of the party of revolt, granted letters of marque to a number of vessels manned by crews of desperadoes drawn from all nationalities. Eighteen ships received [[letters of marque]], which were equipped by [[Louis of Nassau]] in the French [[Huguenot]] port of [[La Rochelle]], which they continued to use as a base.<ref name="Pratt">{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-ErnqPO3VCYC&pg=PA155 |title=The Battles That Changed History by Fletcher Pratt p.155 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Z-48AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA288 |title=The new Cambridge modern history: The Counter-Reformation by R. B. Wernham p.288 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11}}</ref> By the end of 1569, already 84 Sea Beggars ships were in action.<ref name="Pratt"/>

These fierce [[privateer]]s under the command of a succession of daring and reckless leaders, the best-known of whom is [[William de la Marck, Lord of Lumey]], were called  "Sea Beggars", "Gueux de mer" in French, or "Watergeuzen" in Dutch. At first they were content merely to plunder both by sea and land, carrying their booty to the English ports where they were able to refit and replenish their stores.

However, in 1572, Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] abruptly refused to admit the Sea Beggars to her harbours. No longer having refuge, they made a desperate [[Capture of Brielle|attack]] upon [[Brielle]], which they seized by surprise in the absence of the Spanish garrison on 1 April 1572. Encouraged by this surprising success, they now sailed to [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]], which was also taken by a ''[[coup de main]]''. The capture of these two towns prompted several nearby towns to declare for revolt, starting a chain reaction that resulted in the majority of [[Holland]] joining in a general revolt of the Netherlands, and is regarded as the real beginning of Dutch independence.  

In 1573 the Sea Beggars defeated a Spanish squadron under the command of [[Maximilien de H<U+00E9>nin-Li<U+00E9>tard|Admiral Bossu]] off the port of [[Hoorn]] in the [[Battle on the Zuiderzee]]. Mixing with the native population, they quickly sparked rebellions against "[[Fernando <U+00C1>lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|the Iron Duke]]" in town after town and spread the resistance southward.

Some of the forefathers of the great [[List of Dutch naval heroes|Dutch naval heroes]] began their naval careers as Sea Beggars, such as Evert Heindricxzen, the grandfather of [[Cornelis Evertsen the Elder]]. 

==Geuzen symbols==
[[File:3 Geuzenpenning, halve maan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Geuzen medal]], cast silver, tooled, about 1570, with the slogans [[Liever Turks dan Paaps|LIVER TVRCX DAN PAVS]] ("Rather Turkish than Papist") and EN DESPIT DE LA MES ("In spite of the Mass").]]

As part of a propaganda campaign including prints, pamphlets and much else, many [[Geuzen medals]] were created as badges of affiliation, using a wide range of symbolism, including that associated with the [[Ottoman Empire]].  [[William I of Orange]] sought Ottoman assistance against the Spanish king [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Dx0BFlJd3lIC&pg=PA75 |title=New Turkes: dramatizing Islam and the Ottomans in early modern England by Matthew Dimmock p.75 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11}}</ref>

The "Geuzen" were expressing their anti-Spanish and anti-Catholic sentiments. They considered the Turks to be less threatening than the Spaniards. During the years between 1579 and 1582, representatives from Grand Vizier [[Sokollu Mehmed Pa<U+015F>a]] travelled several times from Istanbul to Antwerp.<ref>{{cite web |title=Palais de Hollande in Istanbul: the embassy and envoys of the Netherlands since 1612'' |page=19 |first=Marlies |last=Hoenkamp-Mazgon |location=Boom |year=2002 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9zVpAAAAMAAJ&q=%22were+expressing+their+anti-Spanish+and+anti-Catholic%22&dq=%22were+expressing+their+anti-Spanish+and+anti-Catholic%22&hl=ja&ei=9s1KTI70AYiWOIn2yZYD&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA }}</ref> 

The slogan ''Liever Turks dan Paaps'' seems to have been largely rhetorical, and their beggars medals in the form of a half moon were meant symbolically. The Dutch hardly contemplated life under the Sultan. Moreover, there was no direct contact between the Geuzen and the Turkish authorities. The Turks were considered infidels, and the heresy of Islam alone disqualified them from assuming a more central (or consistent) role in the rebels' propaganda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U-OshMIPD48C&pg=PA103 |title=Innocence abroad: the Dutch imagination and the New World, 1570-1670 by Benjamin Schmidt p.104 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11}}</ref>
