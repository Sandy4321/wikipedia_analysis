The '''Whig Party''' was a [[political party]] of the [[United States]] during the era of [[Jacksonian democracy]]. Considered integral to the [[Second Party System]] and operating from the early 1830s to the mid-1850s,<ref>Holt (1999), p. 231.</ref> the party was formed in opposition to the policies of President [[Andrew Jackson]] and his  [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. In particular, the Whigs supported the supremacy of Congress over the presidency and favored a program of [[modernization]] and [[economic protectionism]]. This name was chosen to echo the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|American Whigs]] of 1776, who fought for independence and because "Whig" was then a widely recognized label of choice for people who saw themselves as opposing tyranny.<ref>The name was not directly related to the Whig party in England. Holt (1999), pp. 27<U+2013>30.</ref> The Whig Party counted among its members such national political luminaries as [[Daniel Webster]], [[William Henry Harrison]], and their preeminent leader, [[Henry Clay]] of [[Kentucky]]. In addition to Harrison, the Whig Party also nominated war heroes generals [[Zachary Taylor]] and [[Winfield Scott]]. [[Abraham Lincoln]] was the chief Whig leader in frontier Illinois.

In its two decades of existence, the Whig Party saw two of its candidates, William Henry Harrison and Zachary Taylor, elected president. Both, however, died in office. [[John Tyler]] became president after Harrison's death but was expelled from the party. [[Millard Fillmore]], who became president after Taylor's death, was the last Whig to hold the nation's highest office.

The party was ultimately destroyed by the question of whether to allow the expansion of slavery to the territories. With deep fissures in the party on this question, the [[anti-slavery]] faction successfully prevented the renomination of its own incumbent President Fillmore in the [[United States presidential election, 1852|1852 presidential election]]; instead, the party nominated General [[Winfield Scott]]. Most Whig party leaders thereupon quit politics (as Lincoln did temporarily) or changed parties.  The northern voter base mostly joined the new [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. By the [[United States presidential election, 1856|1856 presidential election]], the party was virtually defunct.  In the South, the party vanished, but as Thomas Alexander has shown, Whiggery as a policy orientation persisted for decades and played a major role in shaping the modernizing policies of the state governments during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] after 1865.<ref name="Alexander 1961"/>

==Origins==
The American Whigs, whose name [[Whig (British political party)#Name|originates]] from Scottish Presbyterian radicals, were [[modernization|modernizers]] who saw President [[Andrew Jackson]] as "a dangerous man on horseback" with a "reactionary opposition" to the forces of social, economic and moral modernization. Most of the founders of the Whig party had supported [[Jeffersonian democracy]] and the [[Democratic-Republican Party]]. The Republicans who formed the Whig party, led by [[Henry Clay]] and [[John Quincy Adams]], drew on a Jeffersonian tradition of compromise and balance in government, national unity, territorial expansion, and support for a national transportation network and domestic manufacturing. Jacksonians looked to Jefferson for opposition to the National Bank and internal improvements and support of egalitarian democracy and state power. Despite the apparent unity of Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans from 1800 to 1824, ultimately the American people preferred partisan opposition to popular political agreement.<ref>David Brown, "Jeffersonian Ideology and the Second Party System." ''Historian'' 1999 62(1): 17-30.</ref>

As Jackson purged his opponents, vetoed internal improvements and killed the [[Second Bank of the United States]], alarmed local elites fought back. In 1831 Henry Clay re-entered the Senate and started planning a new party. He defended national rather than sectional interests. Clay's plan for distributing among the states the proceeds from the sale of lands in the public domain was intended to serve the nation by providing the states with funds for building roads and canals, which would stimulate growth and knit the sections together. His Jacksonian opponents, however, distrusted the federal government and opposed all federal aid for internal improvements and they again frustrated Clay's plan. The "Tariff of Abominations" of 1828 had outraged Southern feelings; the South's leaders held that the high duties on foreign imports gave an advantage to the North (where the factories were located). Clay's own high tariff schedule of 1832 further disturbed them, as did his stubborn defense of high duties as necessary to his "[[American System (economic plan)|American System]]". Clay however moved to pass the Compromise of 1833, which met Southern complaints by a gradual reduction of the rates on imports to a maximum of twenty percent.  Controlling the Senate for a while, Whigs passed a censure motion denouncing Jackson's arrogant assumption of executive power in the face of the true will of the people as represented by Congress. 

Clay ran as a Whig in 1832 against Jackson but carried only 49 electoral votes against Jackson's 219. Clay and his Whig allies failed in repeated attempts to continue the Second Bank of the United States, which Jackson denounced as a monopoly and from which he abruptly removed all government deposits. Clay was the unquestioned leader of the Whig party nationwide and in Washington, but he was vulnerable to Jacksonian allegations that he associated with the upper class at a time when white males without property had the right to vote and wanted someone more like themselves. The Whigs nominated a war hero in 1840<U+2014>and emphasized [[William Henry Harrison]] had given up the high life to live in a log cabin on the frontier. Harrison won.

==Party structure==
The Whigs suffered greatly from factionalism throughout their existence, as well as weak party loyalty that stood in contrast to the strong party discipline that was the hallmark of a tight Democratic Party organization.<ref>Lynn Marshall. "The Strange Stillbirth of the Whig Party," ''American Historical Review,'' (1967) v. 72 pp. 445-68</ref>  One strength of the Whigs, however, was a superb network of newspapers that provided an internal information system; their leading editor was [[Horace Greeley]] of the powerful ''[[New York Tribune]]''.  

In the 1840s Whigs won 49 percent of gubernatorial elections, with strong bases in the manufacturing Northeast and in the border states. The trend over time, however, was for the Democratic vote to grow faster and for the Whigs to lose more and more marginal states and districts. After the close [[United States presidential election, 1844|1844]] contest, the Democratic advantage widened and the Whigs could win the White House only if the Democrats split. This was partly because of the increased political importance of the western states, which generally voted for Democrats, and [[Irish-Americans|Irish Catholic]] and [[German Americans|German immigrants]], who voted heavily for the Democrats.

The Whigs appealed to voters in every socio-economic category but proved especially attractive to the professional and business classes: doctors, lawyers, merchants, ministers, bankers, storekeepers, factory owners, commercially-oriented farmers and large-scale planters. In general, commercial and manufacturing towns and cities voted Whig, save for strongly Democratic precincts in Irish Catholic and German immigrant communities; the Democrats often sharpened their appeal to the poor by ridiculing the Whigs' aristocratic pretensions.  Protestant religious revivals also injected a moralistic element into the Whig ranks.<ref>Holt (1999) p. 83</ref>

==Whig issues==
The Whigs celebrated Clay's vision of the "American System" that promoted rapid economic and industrial growth in the United States. Whigs demanded government support for a more modern, market-oriented economy, in which skill, expertise and bank credit would count for more than physical strength or land ownership. Whigs sought to promote faster industrialization through high tariffs, a business-oriented money supply based on a national bank and a vigorous program of government funded "internal improvements," especially expansion of the road and canal systems. To modernize the inner America, the Whigs helped create public schools, private colleges, charities, and cultural institutions.  Many were pietistic Protestant reformers who  called for public schools to teach moral values and proposed [[prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] to end the liquor problem.

The Democrats harkened to the Jeffersonian ideal of an egalitarian agricultural society, advising that traditional farm life bred republican simplicity, while modernization threatened to create a politically powerful caste of rich aristocrats who threatened to subvert democracy. In general the Democrats enacted their policies at the national level, while the Whigs succeeded in passing modernization projects in most states.

===Education===
Arguing that universal public education was the best way to turn the nation's unruly children into disciplined, judicious [[Republicanism in the United States|republican]] citizens, [[Horace Mann]] (1796<U+2013>1859) won widespread approval from modernizers, especially  among fellow Whigs, for building public schools.  Indeed, most states adopted one version or another of the system he established in Massachusetts, especially the program for "normal schools" to train professional teachers.<ref>Mark Groen, "The Whig Party and the Rise of Common Schools, 1837-1854," ''American Educational History Journal'' Spring/Summer 2008, Vol. 35 Issue 1/2, pp 251-260</ref>

==1836-1840==
In the [[United States presidential election, 1836|1836]] elections, the party was not yet sufficiently organized to run one nationwide candidate; instead [[William Henry Harrison]] was its candidate in the northern and border states, [[Hugh Lawson White]] ran in the South, and [[Daniel Webster]] ran in his home state of Massachusetts. Whigs hoped that their three candidates would amass enough [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] votes among them to deny a majority to [[Martin Van Buren]]. That would move the election to the [[History of the United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], allowing the ascendant Whigs to select their most popular man as president. The Whigs came only a few thousand votes short of victory in Pennsylvania, vindicating their strategy but failed nonetheless.

In late 1839, the Whigs held their [[1839 Whig National Convention|first national convention]] and nominated [[William Henry Harrison]] as their presidential candidate. In March 1840, Harrison pledged to serve only one term as President if elected, a pledge which reflected popular support for a Constitutional limit to Presidential terms among many in the Whig Party.  Harrison went on to victory in [[United States presidential election, 1840|1840]], defeating Van Buren's re-election bid largely as a result of the [[Panic of 1837]] and subsequent depression. Harrison served only 31 days and became the first President to die in office. He was succeeded by [[John Tyler]], a Virginian and [[states' rights]] absolutist. Tyler [[veto]]ed the Whig economic legislation and was expelled from the Whig party in 1841. The Whigs' internal disunity and the nation's increasing prosperity made the party's activist economic program seem less necessary and led to a disastrous showing in the 1842 Congressional elections.

==A brief golden age==

Political cartoon about the 1848 presidential election which refers to [[Zachary Taylor]] or [[Winfield Scott]], the two leading contenders for the Whig Party nomination in the aftermath of the [[Mexican-American War]].  Published by [[Nathaniel Currier]] in 1848, digitally restored.]]
[[Image:Clay44b.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Horace Greeley]]'s ''New York Tribune''&nbsp;<U+2014> the leading Whig paper&nbsp;<U+2014> endorsed Clay for President and Fillmore for Governor, 1844]]
By 1844, the Whigs began their recovery by nominating [[Henry Clay]], who lost to Democrat [[James K. Polk]] in a closely contested race, with Polk's policy of western expansion (particularly the annexation of [[Texas]]) and free trade triumphing over Clay's protectionism and caution over the Texas question. The Whigs, both northern and southern, strongly opposed expansion into Texas, which they (including Whig Congressman [[Abraham Lincoln]]) saw as an unprincipled land grab. In 1848, the Whigs, seeing no hope of success by nominating Clay, nominated General [[Zachary Taylor]], a Mexican-American War hero. They stopped criticizing the war and adopted no platform at all. Taylor defeated Democratic candidate [[Lewis Cass]] and the anti-slavery [[Free Soil Party]], who had nominated former President [[Martin Van Buren]]. Van Buren's candidacy split the Democratic vote in New York, throwing that state to the Whigs; at the same time, however, the [[Free Soilers]] probably cost the Whigs several Midwestern states.

===Compromise of 1850===
Taylor was firmly opposed to the [[Compromise of 1850]] and committed to the admission of California as a free state and had proclaimed that he would take military action to prevent secession. In July 1850, Taylor died; Vice President [[Millard Fillmore]], a long-time Whig, became President and helped push the Compromise through Congress, in the hopes of ending the controversies over slavery. The Compromise of 1850 was first proposed by Henry Clay.

The Whigs were unable to deal with the slavery issue after 1850. Their southern leaders nearly all owned slaves. The northeastern Whigs, led by [[Daniel Webster]], represented businessmen who loved the national flag and a national market but cared little about slavery one way or another. However many Whig voters in the North felt that slavery was incompatible with a free-labor, free-market economy and supported the [[Wilmot Proviso]] that did not pass Congress but would have stopped the expansion of slavery.  No one discovered a compromise that would keep the party united. Furthermore the burgeoning economy made full-time careers in business or law much more attractive than politics for ambitious young Whigs. Thus the party leader in Illinois, [[Abraham Lincoln]], simply abandoned politics after 1849.

==Death throes, 1852<U+2013>1856==
[[Image:filmorem.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Millard Fillmore]], the last Whig president]]
When new issues of nativism, prohibition and anti-slavery burst on the scene in the mid 1850s, no one looked to the fast- disintegrating Whig party for answers. In the north most ex-Whigs joined the new Republican party, and in the South, they flocked to a new short-lived "American" party. 

The election of 1852 marked the beginning of the end for the Whigs. The deaths of [[Henry Clay]] and [[Daniel Webster]] that year severely weakened the party. The [[Compromise of 1850]] fractured the Whigs along pro- and anti-slavery lines, with the anti-slavery faction having enough power to deny Fillmore the party's nomination in 1852. 1852's Whig Party convention in New York City saw the historic meeting between Alvan E. Bovay and The New York Tribune's Horace Greeley, a meeting which led to correspondence between the men as the early Republican Party meetings in 1854 began to take place.  Attempting to repeat their earlier successes, the Whigs nominated popular General [[Winfield Scott]], who lost decisively to the Democrats' [[Franklin Pierce]]. The Democrats won the election by a large margin: Pierce won 27 of the 31 states including Scott's home state of [[Virginia]]. Whig Representative [[Lewis D. Campbell]] of [[Ohio]] was particularly distraught by the defeat, exclaiming, "We are slain. The party is dead&mdash;dead&mdash;dead!" Increasingly politicians realized that the party was a loser. [[Abraham Lincoln]], its Illinois leader, for example, ceased his Whig activities and attended to his law business.

In 1854, the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]], which opened the new territories to slavery, was passed. Southern Whigs generally supported the Act while Northern Whigs remained strongly opposed. Most remaining Northern Whigs, like Lincoln, joined the new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and strongly attacked the Act, appealing to widespread northern outrage over the repeal of the [[Missouri Compromise]]. Other Whigs joined the [[Know-Nothing movement|Know-Nothing Party]], attracted by its nativist crusades against so-called "corrupt" [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Germans|German]] immigrants. In the South, the Whig party vanished, but as Thomas Alexander has shown, Whiggism as a modernizing policy orientation persisted for decades.<ref name="Alexander 1961">Alexander (1961).</ref> Historians estimate that, in the South in 1856, Fillmore retained 86 percent of the 1852 Whig voters. He won only 13% of the northern vote, though that was just enough to tip Pennsylvania out of the Republican column. The future in the North, most observers thought at the time, was Republican. No one saw any prospects for the shrunken old party, and after 1856 there was virtually no Whig organization left anywhere.<ref>[http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=99173945 Holt pp. 979-80].</ref> Some Whigs and others adopted the mantle of the "[[Opposition Party (United States)|Opposition Party]]" for several years and had some success.

==Legacy==
In 1860, many former Whigs who had not joined the Republicans regrouped as the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]], which nominated only a national ticket; it had considerable strength in the border states, which feared the onset of civil war. [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] finished third in the [[electoral college]].  

During the Lincoln Administration (1861<U+2013>65), ex-Whigs dominated the Republican Party and enacted much of the "American System;" later their southern cousins dominated the white response to Reconstruction. In the long run, America adopted Whiggish economic policies coupled with a Democratic strong presidency.

In the South during the latter part of the war and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], many former Whigs tried to regroup in the South, calling themselves "Conservatives" and hoping to reconnect with ex-Whigs in the North. They were eventually merged  into the Democratic Party in the South but continued to promote modernization policies such as railroad building and public schools.<ref name="Alexander 1961"/>

In today's discourse in American politics, the Whig Party is often cited as a dreary example of a political party losing its followers and its reason for being, as by the phrase "going the way of the Whigs."<ref>Donald T. Critchlow, ''The conservative ascendancy: how the GOP right made political history'' (2007) p. 103. Additional [http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks:1&tbo=p&q=%22Going+the+way+of+the+whigs%22&num=10 examples are of online].</ref>

The [[True Whig Party]] - named in direct emulation of the American Party - was the dominant force in the politics of [[Liberia]] for more than a century.
