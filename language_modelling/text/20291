The '''CF-101 Voodoo''' was an all-weather [[interceptor aircraft]] operated by the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and [[Canadian Forces]] between 1961 and 1984. They were manufactured by the [[McDonnell Aircraft Corporation]] of [[St. Louis, Missouri]] for the [[United States Air Force]] (as [[F-101 Voodoo|F-101]]s), and later sold to [[Canada]]. CF-101s replaced the obsolete [[Avro CF-100]] in the RCAF's all-weather fighter squadrons. The Voodoo's primary armament was [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[AIR-2 Genie|AIR-2A Genie]] unguided air-to-air rockets, and there was significant political controversy in Canada about their adoption. Although they never [[Fire in anger|fired a weapon in anger]], the CF-101 served as Canada's primary means of air defence throughout their service life from Quick Reaction Alert facilities at [[Canadian Forces base|Canadian airbases]]. The CF-101s were retired in the 1980s and replaced with [[CF-18 Hornet]] fighters. Many examples are preserved in museums and parks in Canada and the [[United States]].

==Acquisition==
===Decision to acquire the CF-101===
After the cancellation of the [[Avro Arrow|CF-105 Arrow]] program in February 1959, [[George Randolph Pearkes|George Pearkes]], the Canadian [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]] officially maintained that the existing Avro CF-100 interceptors and the [[Bomarc Missile Program|Bomarc]] [[missile]]s that had been ordered in September 1958 would be adequate for Canada<U+2019>s air defense needs. Unofficially, it was recognized that there was still a [[bomber]] threat, and discussions had been underway since before the formal conclusion of the [[Avro Arrow]] program concerning the RCAF acquiring an "off the shelf" interceptor from the United States. 

The USAF indicated that it was prepared to make 56 '''F-101B''' interceptors and 10 '''F-101F''' trainers available (by employing [[Convair]] [[F-102 Delta Dagger|F-102]]s in less demanding [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]] sectors) for Canadian purchase. The deal was delayed for over a year by negotiations on costs and offsets of the acquisition, as well as debate within the [[John George Diefenbaker|Diefenbaker]] government about Canada adopting nuclear weapons systems (which had been agreed to in principle back in 1958). The financial arrangements were sorted out by Canada taking over the staffing and funding of 11 [[Pinetree Line]] [[radar]] stations within Canada that had formerly been operated and funded by the USAF.

===Introduction to service===
[[File:RCAF CF-101B Voodoo.jpg|right|thumb|CF-101B Voodoo 17395 at the Bagotville Air Pageant, summer 1962]]
A detailed agreement signed in June 1961 covered the transfer of the aircraft, to equip five front-line squadrons (replacing nine CF-100 squadrons) and an Operational Training Unit (OTU). The first two aircraft were transferred to Canada in a special ceremony at [[CFB Uplands|RCAF Uplands]] in [[Ottawa]], on 24 July 1961, marking the beginning of Operation <U+201C>Queen<U+2019>s Row.<U+201D> [[No. 425 Squadron RCAF|425 Squadron]] officially began operations as a Voodoo squadron at [[CFB Edmonton|RCAF Namao]], [[Alberta]], on 15 October 1961, initially acting as the conversion training squadron to convert 410, 416, 409 and 414 Squadrons to the Voodoo. No. 425 Squadron then became an operational unit itself, turning the conversion role over to No. 3 All Weather OTU at [[CFB Bagotville|RCAF Bagotville]], [[Quebec]]. By the end of 1962, the squadrons were operating out of [[CFB Comox|RCAF Comox]], [[British Columbia]], ([[No. 409 Squadron RCAF|409 Squadron]]), [[CFB North Bay|RCAF North Bay]], [[Ontario]], ([[No. 414 Squadron RCAF|414 Squadron]]), RCAF Uplands, Ottawa, Ontario, ([[No. 410 Squadron RCAF|410 Squadron]]), RCAF Bagotville, Quebec, (425 Squadron), and [[CFB Chatham|RCAF Chatham]], [[New Brunswick]], ([[No. 416 Squadron RCAF|416 Squadron]]).  Defence cuts in 1964 eliminated Nos. 410 and 414 Squadrons (although a reformed 414 Squadron would operate the Voodoo again many years later).

===Nuclear weapons controversy===
[[Image:CF-101B firing Genie 1982.jpeg|thumb|right|CF-101B firing [[AIR-2 Genie]] in 1982]]
The issue of bringing [[Canada and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons to Canada]] had not been entirely resolved in June 1961, and the CF-101s remained armed only with their secondary [[AIM-4 Falcon|AIM-4D Falcon]] missiles.  The complications of resolving this issue finally led to the collapse of the Diefenbaker government in April 1963.  The succeeding [[Lester Bowles Pearson|Pearson]] government finally signed an agreement with the United States concerning nuclear arms for Canada on 16 August 1963. The agreement did not actually state that Canada was acquiring [[nuclear weapon]]s, and in fact the Canadian government usually refused to confirm or deny that there were any nuclear arms in Canada. The agreement specifically stated that the [[AIR-2 Genie|AIR-2A Genie]] rockets were the property of the United States, and would only be released to Canada for actual use with the joint agreement of Canada and the United States through NORAD. The stringent training requirements meant that it took until June 1965 for the Genies to become operational in Canada. The Genies were kept in the custody of the USAF, with detachments of the 425th Munitions Support Squadron located at each of the Canadian bases.

==Squadron operations==
Each Voodoo base was laid out to allow aircraft to be kept at immediate readiness at all times. A Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) facility was positioned at the end of the main runway, to allow alert aircraft to launch as quickly as possible. Two aircraft and their crews were always on <U+201C>five minute<U+201D> alert <U+2013> the aircraft were to be in the air, en route to intercept unknown aircraft, within five minutes of receiving the order. In one instance, 416 Squadron was able to get two alert aircraft in the air only 57 seconds after receiving the alert.  Voodoos were dispatched with some regularity to intercept unidentified NORAD radar contacts <U+2013> usually [[airliner]]s flying off course, although 416 and 425 occasionally intercepted [[Soviet]] [[Tupolev Tu-95|Tu-95 Bear]] bombers flying along the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] coast to [[Cuba]]. Fortunately, no situation ever arose that required the CF-101 to fire its weapons in anger.

===Operation Peace Wings===
Between 1970 and 1972, Canada traded the 56 survivors of the original CF-101 fleet back to the USAF for 66 replacements, under [[Operation Peace Wings]]. The "new" aircraft were actually manufactured earlier than the original fleet, but the airframes had a lower number of hours, with updates that had not been performed on the Canadian Voodoo fleet (including the addition of an [[Infra-red search and track|IR tracking system]]). [[Bristol Aerospace]] of [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], performed modifications on the incoming fleet, which involved transferring some specifically Canadian items of equipment, including engines, from the <U+201C>old<U+201D> aircraft to the <U+201C>new.<U+201D> Many of the <U+201C>old<U+201D> Canadian Voodoos were scrapped when they returned to the U.S., but 22 were converted to RF-101B photo-[[reconnaissance]] versions, and flew with the [[Nevada]] [[Air National Guard]] until 1975.

==Obsolescence and retirement==
Through the 1970s, the increasing obsolescence of the CF-101 and the [[Canadair_CF-104|CF-104]] led to plans for their joint replacement by a single type. The [[New Fighter Aircraft program]] was launched in 1977 with the intention of finding a replacement for the [[F-5 Freedom Fighter|CF-5]], CF-104 Starfighter and CF-101 Voodoo. The [[F-14 Tomcat]], [[F-15 Eagle]], [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Falcon]], [[F/A-18 Hornet|F-18 Hornet]], [[Panavia Tornado]] and the [[Dassault Mirage F1]] (later replaced by the [[Mirage 2000]]) were all considered and evaluated as potential replacements. Cost considerations eventually reduced the choice to the F-16 and F-18, and the F-18 ultimately prevailed, likely because of the additional safety of twin engines when flying in remote areas. The decision, announced on 10 April 1980, was the beginning of the end for the Voodoo in Canada. The Voodoo OTU converted to [[CF-18 Hornet]]s in June 1982 to begin training aircrew for Canada's new fighter. 409 and 425 Squadrons stood down at the end of June 1984, with 416 Squadron remaining in service until the end of December 1984 as the world<U+2019>s last front-line Voodoo squadron. With the stand down, the last nuclear weapons in Canada were returned to the United States.

===Air displays===
Throughout the Voodoo era in Canada, the aircraft was a popular performer at [[airshow]]s and other flying events in Canada and the United States, with displays ranging from the appearance of a single aircraft all the way up to an entire squadron. Most noteworthy was the appearance of a CF-101 (in company with a CF-104 and [[The Red Knight (aircraft)|The Red Knight]] [[Lockheed T-33|T-33]]) as part of the [[Golden Centennaires]] display team, celebrating Canada's Centennial in 1967. Also, in 1984, each squadron painted a special "'show" aircraft to commemorate the impending retirement of the type, incorporating that Squadrons symbol. 409 Squadron produced "Hawk One Canada," 416 Squadron produced "Lynx One Canada," and 425 Squadron produced "Lark One Canada/Alouette Un Canada."

===The "Electric Voodoo"===
Two Voodoos remained in service after the stand-down <U+2013> the unique '''EF-101B''' electronic jamming aircraft (also known as the "Electric Voodoo"), and a single CF-101F trainer, in service with 414 Squadron at North Bay, Ontario. The EF-101B was a conversion of a regular F-101B, incorporating the electronic jamming suite from an [[B-57 Canberra|EB-57E Canberra]]. Only one aircraft was converted before the program was cancelled and this sole example was leased to Canada. The last  two Voodoos continued to fly until April 1987 when they were finally retired. The EF-101B was returned to the United States on 7 April 1987, while CF-101F 101006 made the world's last Voodoo flight on 19 April 1987, as it made a delivery flight to CFB Chatham, for eventual display at [[CFB Cornwallis]], [[Nova Scotia]].
