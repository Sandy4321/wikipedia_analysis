'''Mozarabic chant''' (also known as '''Hispanic chant''', '''Old Hispanic chant''', '''Old Spanish chant''', or '''Visigothic chant''') is the liturgical [[plainsong|plainchant]] repertory of the [[Mozarabic rite]] of the [[Roman Catholic]] Church, related to but distinct from [[Gregorian chant]].  It is primarily associated with the [[Iberian Peninsula]] under [[Visigoth]]ic rule (mainly in what was to become modern [[Spain]]) and with the Catholic [[Mozarab]]s living under [[Muslim]] rule, and was soon replaced by the chant of the [[Roman Rite|Roman rite]] following the Christian [[Reconquista|Reconquest]].  Although its original medieval form is largely lost, a few chants have survived with readable musical notation, and the chanted rite was later revived in altered form and continues to be used in a few isolated locations in Spain, primarily in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].

==Name==
No wholly satisfactory name has been found for this chant tradition, leading to several competing names. ''Mozarabic'' is the most common name, referring to the [[Mozarab]]s, Christians in [[Hispania]] (modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) living under [[Muslim]] rule.  However, the chant almost certainly existed before the Muslim occupation in 711. ''Visigothic'' refers to the [[Visigoth]]s who were driven from [[Gaul]] and came south, dominating the Iberian peninsula and converting from [[Arianism]] to Catholicism in 587, and their Iberian descendants; however, the Catholic rite existed in Hispania prior to their conversion, and the chant was not limited to Visigoths, so ''Old Spanish'' has been used as an alternative.  But again, the chant was found in Portugal as well as Spain, so ''Hispanic'' or ''Old Hispanic'' are also used by scholars.  "Hispanic" has its own ambiguity, though, so "Mozarabic" will probably remain despite its slight inaccuracy.

==History==
The basic structure of the rite that came to be known as the [[Mozarabic rite]] was documented by St. [[Isidore of Seville]] in the 7th century.  The [[Credo]] had already been introduced into the Mozarabic rite in the [[Third Council of Toledo]] of 589, in which the [[Visigoth]]s officially converted to Catholicism.  (The Credo would not be used in the [[Roman Rite|Roman rite]] in Rome itself until after 1014, at the request of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]].)

[[Image:Toledo.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The [[fa<U+00E7>ade]] of Toledo cathedral]]The Mozarabic rite shares similarities with the [[Ambrosian rite]] and [[Gallican rite]], and differs from the [[Roman Rite|Roman rite]].  As the Christian [[Reconquista|reconquest]] of Hispania went on, the Roman rite supplanted the Mozarabic.  With the papal appointment of a French abbot as the new archbishop of Toledo, which had been recaptured in 1085, Roman influence could be enforced throughout the Hispanic Church.  Following its official suppression by [[Pope Gregory VII]], the Mozarabic rite and its chant disappeared in all but six parishes in Toledo.

The Mozarabic rite was revived by [[Francisco Cardinal Jim<U+00E9>nez de Cisneros|Cardinal Jim<U+00E9>nez de Cisneros]], who published in 1500 and 1502 a Mozarabic Missal and [[Breviary]], incorporating elements of the Roman rite, and dedicated a chapel to preserving the Mozarabic rite.  However, the chant used for this restored Mozarabic rite shows significant influence from [[Gregorian chant]], and does not appear to resemble the Mozarabic chant sung prior to the reconquest.

==General characteristics==
Mozarabic chant is largely defined by its role in the liturgy of the [[Mozarabic rite]], which is more closely related to the northern "Gallic" liturgies such as the [[Gallican rite]] and the [[Ambrosian rite]] than the [[Roman Rite|Roman rite]].  Musically, little is known about the chant.  Most of the surviving music is written in [[neume]]s that show the contour of the chant, but no pitches or intervals.  Only twenty or so sources contain music that can be transcribed.

However, some things are known about the Mozarabic repertory.  Like all [[plainsong|plainchant]], Mozarabic chant was [[monophony|monophonic]] and ''[[a cappella]]''.  In accordance with Roman Catholic tradition, it is primarily intended to be sung by males.

As in Gregorian chant, Mozarabic chant melodies can be broadly grouped into four categories: recitation, syllabic, neumatic, and [[melisma]]tic.  Recitations are the simplest, comprised primarily of a simple [[reciting tone]].  Syllabic chants have mostly one note per syllable.  Neumatic chants have a small number of notes, often just two or three, notes per syllable.  Melismatic chants feature long, florid runs of notes, called [[melisma]]s, on individual syllables.

In both Mozarabic and Gregorian chant, there is a distinction between [[antiphon]]al and [[responsory|responsorial]] chants.  Originally, responsorial chant alternated between a soloist singing a verse and a chorus singing a refrain called the ''respond'', while antiphonal chant alternated between two semi-choruses singing a verse and an interpolated text called an ''[[antiphon]]''.  In the developed chant traditions, they took on more functional characteristics.  In an antiphonal chant, the antiphon is generally longer and more melodic than the verse, which is usually sung to a simpler formula called a ''[[psalm]] tone''.  In a responsorial chant, the verse and refrain are often comparable in style and melodic content.

Mozarabic chants used a different system of [[psalm]] tones for psalm [[antiphon]]s than Gregorian chant.  Unlike the standardized Gregorian classification of chants into eight [[musical mode|mode]]s, Mozarabic chant used between four and seven, depending on the local tradition.  Many Mozarabic chants are recorded with no musical notation at all, or just the [[incipit]], suggesting that the psalm tones followed simple and frequently used formulas.

The musical forms encountered in Mozarabic chant present a number of analogies with those of the Roman rite. For example, a comparable distinction exists between antiphonal and responsorial singing. And Mozarabic chant may be seen to make use of three styles: syllabic, neumatic and melismatic, much as in Gregorian chant. In the following descriptions of the principal musical items in both the Mozarabic Office and Mass, some of these analogies will be discussed further. The items from the Mass are presented here in the appropriate liturgical order.

The ''Antiphons'' are the largest category of [[Canonical hours|Office]] chants.  Most are moderately syllabic, with simple recitations used for the verses, sung in [[antiphon]]y.

The ''Alleluiatici'' are also antiphonal chants, whose text usually involves an [[alleluia]], similar in style to regular antiphons.  Unlike the [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian]] repertory, these are sung at [[Matins]] and [[Vespers]] even on penitential days, when "alleluia" is omitted from the liturgy.

Matins features a musical form called the ''missa'', which consists of an Alleluiaticus framed by two Antiphons and a ''Responsory''.  Later missae show common musical material thematically uniting the missa.  The Responsories, which are primarily found at the end of a missa, are generally neumatic, consisting of melodic formulas that adjust to fit the lengths of different phrases, ending in a fixed cadence.

Other Office chants include the morning-themed ''Matutinaria'', the ''Benedictiones'' using texts from the [[Book of Daniel]], the melismatic ''Soni'', and the alleluiatic ''Laudes''.  The ''Psallendi'', unrelated to the Psallendae of [[Ambrosian chant]], end with the [[Doxology]].

The neumatic Vespertini, like the Lucernaria of Ambrosian chant, usually allude to the lighting of lamps or to nightfall.  They show a high degree of ''[[centonization]]'', construction from a vocabulary of stock musical phrases, and ''adaptation'', application of a pre-existing melody to a new text.

''Preces'' are short, lightly neumatic musical prayers in rhyme with a refrain.  They exist in both the [[Mozarabic rite]] and the [[Gallican rite]], but the concordance between the two rites appears to be liturgical and not musical.  Finally, the Office chants include a number of ''Hymns'', many of which are found throughout Catholic Europe, although we do not know if the same melodies were used.

===Chants of the Mass===
The Mass is the Christian celebration of the [[Eucharist]].  Plainchant occurs prominently in the Mass for several reasons: to communally affirm the faith, to expand on the [[scripture|scriptural]] lessons, and to cover certain actions.  

''Praelegenda'' are opening chants corresponding to the [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian]] [[Introit]], which use the same antiphonal structure and psalm tones found in the Mozarabic [[Canonical hours|Office]].

Unlike the Gregorian [[Gloria]], the Mozarabic ''Gloria in excelsis Deo'' only occurs in some local Mozarabic traditions.

The ''Trisagion'', in which the Greek word "hagios" is sung three times, sometimes quite melismatically or translated into the Latin "sanctus," corresponds to the simple threefold "Kyrie eleison" sung at the end of the Laus missa of the [[Ambrosian rite]].  This is not the liturgical counterpart of the Gregorian [[Sanctus]].

Following the Trisagion are the ''Benedictiones''.  Like the Benedictiones of the Office, these come from the [[Book of Daniel]], but use more complex melodies, whose refrain structure derives directly from the biblical poetry.

The ''Psalmi'' are neumatic and melismatic responsorial chants which function similarly to the Gregorian [[Gradual]].  On a few holidays, the Psalmo leads directly into a ''Clamor''.  Clamores conclude with the refrain of the preceding Psalmo.  During [[Lent]], ''Threni'' substitute for Psalmi.  Each Threnus has a non-repeating refrain followed by several verses, which are sung to the same melody.  This function of replacing another chant on certain penitential days is similar to the way the Gregorian [[Tract (liturgy)|Tract]] replaces the [[Alleluia]].

Just as the Gregorian Gradual is followed by the Alleluia, the Mozarabic Psalmo is followed by the ''Laus''.  Like the Gregorian Alleluias, the Laudes include two melismas on the word "alleluia" surrounding a simpler verse.  During Lent, the Laudes use different texts.

The ''Sacrificium'' corresponds to the Gregorian [[Offertory]].  The Sacrificia appear to be closely related to the Soni chants of the Office.

A few Mozarabic Masses include the ''Ad pacem'', a special Antiphon sung for the kiss of peace, or the ''Ad sanctus'', similar to the Gregorian [[Sanctus]].

Corresponding to the [[Ambrosian chant|Ambrosian]] Confractorium is the ''Ad confractionem panis'', sung for the breaking of the bread.  The chant ''Ad accedentes'', corresponding to the Gregorian [[Communion (chant)|Communion]], follows.
