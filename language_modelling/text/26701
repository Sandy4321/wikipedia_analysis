The '''coconut crab''' ('''''Birgus latro''''') is the largest land-living [[arthropod]] in the world. It is a highly [[apomorph]]ic [[hermit crab]] and is known for its ability to crack [[coconut]]s with its strong [[claw|pincers]] in order to eat the contents. It is the only [[species]] of the [[genus]] ''Birgus''.

It is also called the '''robber crab''' or '''palm thief''', because some coconut crabs are rumored to steal shiny items such as pots and silverware from houses and [[tent]]s<ref>{{cite web

 | accessdate = 2008-08-28
 | publisher = sifi news}}</ref> Another name is '''"terrestrial hermit crab"''', due to the use of [[animal shell|shells]] by the young animals; however, there are other terrestrial hermit crabs which do not get rid of the shell even as adults. These - typically in the closely related genus ''[[Coenobita]]'' - are the animals usually called "terrestrial hermit crab"; given the close relationship between ''Coenobita'' and ''Birgus'' the term would generally refer to any member of the [[Coenobitidae]].

The coconut crab also has a range of local names. For example ''ayuyu'' on [[Guam]], and ''unga'' or ''kaveu'' in the [[Cook Islands]]. On Guam, it is sometimes referred to as a "[[taotaomo'na]] coconut crab" because of the traditional belief that ancestral spirits can return in the form of animals such as the ayuyu (coconut crab).<ref>{{cite web

Reports about the size of ''Birgus latro'' vary, but most references give a body length of up to {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}}<ref>Naskrecki (2005): p.38</ref>, a weight of up to {{convert|9|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, and a leg span of more than {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}} <ref>National Geographic http://www.nationalgeographic.com/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial/im/im0125.html

It is believed that this is near the [[theory|theoretical]] limit for a terrestrial arthropod.<ref>When the body is supported by water, larger sizes are possible for arthropods - see [[Japanese spider crab]].</ref>{{Fact|date=April 2008}}<!-- This claim references another Wikipedia page which makes no such claim and has no references which would support it either --> They can live more than 30 years <ref>National Geographic http://www.nationalgeographic.com/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial/im/im0125.html
</ref>.
The body of the coconut crab is, like that of all [[decapoda|decapods]], divided into a front section ([[cephalothorax]]), which has 10 [[arthropod leg|legs]], and an [[abdomen]]. The front-most pair of legs has large [[claw]]s used to open coconuts, and these claws ([[chelae]]) can lift objects up to 29&nbsp;kg (64&nbsp;lb) in weight. The next two pairs, as with other hermit crabs, are large, powerful walking legs which allow coconut crabs to climb vertically up trees (often coconut palms) up to 6 m high. The fourth pair of legs is smaller with [[tweezers|tweezer]]-like chelae at the end, allowing young crabs to grip the inside of a shell or coconut husk to carry for protection; adults use this pair for walking and climbing. The last pair of legs is very small and serves only to clean the breathing organs. These legs are usually held inside the [[carapace]], in the cavity containing the breathing organs. There is some difference in colour between the animals found on different islands, ranging from light violet through deep purple to brown.

Although ''Birgus latro'' is a [[apomorph|derived]] type of [[hermit crab]], only the juveniles use salvaged [[snail]] [[animal shell|shells]] to protect their soft abdomens, and adolescents sometimes use broken coconut shells to protect their abdomens. Unlike other hermit crabs, the adult coconut crabs do not carry shells, but instead harden their abdominal [[armor]] by depositing [[chitin]] and [[chalk]]. They also bend their [[Tail (anatomy)|tails]] underneath their bodies for protection, as do most [[crab|true crabs]]. The hardened abdomen protects the coconut crab and reduces water loss on land, but has to be moulted at periodic intervals. [[Ecdysis|Moulting]] takes about 30 days, during which the animal's body is soft and vulnerable, and it stays hidden for protection.

===Breathing===
Except as [[larva]]e, coconut crabs cannot swim and even small specimens will [[drowning|drown]] in water. They use a special organ called a [[branchiostegal lung]] to breathe. This organ can be interpreted as a developmental stage between [[gill]]s and [[lung]]s, and is one of the most significant adaptations of the coconut crab to its [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. The chambers of this breathing organ are located in the rear of the cephalothorax. They contain a [[biological tissue|tissue]] similar to that found in gills, but suited to the absorption of [[oxygen]] from air, rather than water. They use their last, smallest pair of legs to clean these breathing organs, and to moisten them with seawater. The organs require water to function, and the crab provides this by stroking its wetted legs over the spongy tissues nearby. Coconut crabs may also drink salt water, using the same technique to transfer water to their mouths. 

In addition to this breathing organ, the coconut crab has an additional rudimentary set of gills. However, while these gills were probably used to breathe under water in the [[evolution]]ary history of the species, they no longer provide sufficient oxygen, and an immersed coconut crab will drown within a few minutes (reports vary, probably depending on the levels of [[stress (medicine)|stress]] and [[exercise]] and the resulting oxygen consumption).

===Smelling===
Another distinctive organ of the coconut crab is its "[[nose]]". The process of smelling works very differently depending whether the smelled molecules are [[hydrophilic]] molecules in water or [[hydrophobic]] molecules in air. As most crabs live in the water, they have specialized organs called [[aesthetascs]] on their [[Antenna (biology)|antenna]]e to determine both the concentration and the direction of a smell. However, as coconut crabs live on the land, the aesthetascs on their antennae differ significantly from those of other crabs and look more like the smelling organs of [[insect]]s, called [[sensilia]]. While insects and the coconut crab originate from different evolutionary paths, the same need to detect smells in the air led to the development of remarkably similar organs, making it an example of [[convergent evolution]]. Coconut crabs also flick their antennae as insects do to enhance their reception. They have an excellent sense of smell and can detect interesting [[odor]]s over large distances. The smell of rotting meat, bananas, and coconuts, all potential food sources, catch their attention especially.<ref>Stensmyr ''et al.'' (2005)</ref>

==Reproduction==
Coconut crabs mate frequently and quickly on dry land in the period from May to September, especially in July and August. The male and the female fight with each other, and the male turns the female on her back to [[mating|mate]]. The whole mating procedure takes about 15 minutes. Shortly thereafter, the female lays her eggs and glues them to the underside of her abdomen, carrying the fertilized eggs underneath her body for a few months. At the time of [[egg (biology)|hatching]], usually October or November, the female coconut crab releases the eggs into the ocean at high [[tide]]. The [[larva]]e are of the [[zoea]] type, as usual for [[Decapoda|decapod]] crustaceans. It is reported that all coconut crabs do this on the same night, with many females on the beach at the same time. 

The larvae float in the ocean for 28 days, during which a large number of them are eaten by predators. Afterwards, they live on the ocean floor and on the shore as [[hermit crab]]s, using discarded shells for protection for another 28 days. At that time, they sometimes visit dry land. As with all hermit crabs, they change their shells as they grow. After these 28 days, they leave the ocean permanently and lose the ability to breathe in water. Young coconut crabs that cannot find a seashell of the right size also often use broken coconut pieces. When they outgrow even coconut shells, they develop a hardened abdomen. About 4 to 8 years after hatching the coconut crab matures and can reproduce. This is an unusually long development period for a [[crustacean]].

==Diet==
[[Image:Robber crab.jpg|thumb|Coconut crabs vary in size and colouring.]]
The diet of coconut crabs consists primarily of [[fruit]], including coconuts (''Cocos nucifera'') and [[fig]]s (''Ficus'' species). However, they will eat nearly anything organic, including [[leaf|leaves]], [[decomposition|rotten]] fruit, [[tortoise]] eggs, dead animals, and the shells of other animals, which are believed to provide [[calcium]]. They may also eat live animals that are too slow to escape, such as freshly hatched [[sea turtle]]s. During a tagging experiment, one coconut crab was observed catching and eating a [[Polynesian Rat]] (''Rattus exulans'').<ref>Kessler (2005)</ref> Coconut crabs often try to steal food from each other and will pull their food into their burrows to be safe while eating.

The coconut crab climbs trees to eat coconuts or fruit, to escape the heat or to escape predators. It is a common perception that the coconut crab cuts the coconuts from the tree to eat them on the ground (hence the German name ''Palmendieb'', which literally means "palm thief," and the Dutch ''Klapperdief'').  Coconut crabs cut holes into coconuts with their strong claws and eat the contents; this behavior is unique in the animal kingdom. 

[[Thomas Hale Streets]] discussed the behavior in 1877 - while at the same time doubting that the crab would climb trees to get at the nuts.<ref name = streets1877>Streets (1877)</ref> And in the 1980s Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how the crabs open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if the coconut is still covered with [[husk]], it will use its claws to rip off strips, always starting from the side with the three [[germination]] [[pore]]s, the group of three small circles found on the outside of the coconut. Once the pores are visible, the crab will bang its pincers on one of them until they break. Afterwards, it will turn around and use the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the white flesh of the coconut. Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption.

==Habitat and distribution==
[[Image:Coconut crans at Bora-Bora.jpg|thumb|Coconut crabs at Bora-Bora]]
Coconut crabs live alone in underground burrows and rock crevices, depending on the local terrain. They dig their own burrows in sand or loose soil. During the day, the animal stays hidden, to protect itself from predators and reduce water loss from heat.  The crabs' burrows contain very fine yet strong fibers of the coconut husk which the animal uses as bedding; this was collected by locals who cherished the material for handicraft.<ref name = streets1877 /> While resting in its burrow, the coconut crab closes the entrance with one of its claws to create the moist microclimate within the burrow necessary for its breathing organs. In areas with a large coconut crab population, some may also come out during the day, perhaps to gain an advantage in the search for food. Coconut crabs will also sometimes come out during the day if it is moist or raining, since these conditions allow them to breathe more easily. They live almost exclusively on land, and some have been found up to 6&nbsp;km from the ocean.

Coconut crabs live in areas from the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] to the central [[Pacific Ocean]]. [[Christmas Island]] in the Indian Ocean has the largest and best-preserved population in the world. Other Indian Ocean populations exist on the [[Seychelles]], especially [[Aldabra]], [[Glorioso Islands]], [[Astove Island]], [[Assumption Island]] and [[Cosmoledo]], but the coconut crab is extinct on the central islands. They are also known on several of the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and [[Nicobar Islands]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Large numbers roam freely in the British-owned [[Chagos Archipelago]], also known as the British Indian Ocean Territories (BIOT). They are protected on these islands from being hunted and/or eaten, with fines of up to 1500 British pounds (roughly $3000 USD) per crab consumed. On [[Mauritius]] and [[Rodrigues]] they are [[extinct]].<ref name = redlist>Eldredge (1996)</ref>

In the Pacific, its range only became gradually known. [[Charles Darwin]] believed it was only found on "a single coral island north of the [[Society Islands|Society group]]."<ref name = streets1877 /> But the crab is actually far more widespread, though certainly not abundant on each and every Pacific island it inhabits.<ref name = streets1877 /> Large populations exist on the [[Cook Islands]], especially [[Pukapuka]], [[Suwarrow]], [[Mangaia]], [[Takutea]], [[Mauke]], [[Atiu]], and [[Palmerston Island]]. These are close to the eastern limit of its range, as are the [[Line Islands]] of [[Kiribati]], where the crab is especially frequent on [[Teraina]] (Washington Island) with its abundant Coconut Palm forest,<ref name = streets1877 /> and on [[Caroline Island]].

As they cannot swim as adults, coconut crabs over time must have colonized the islands as larvae, which can swim. However, due to the large distances between the islands, some researchers{{Fact|date=September 2007}} believe a larvae stadium of 28 days is not enough to travel the distance and they assume juvenile coconut crabs reached other islands on [[driftwood]] and other [[flotsam]].

The distribution shows some gaps, as for example around [[Borneo]], [[Indonesia]] or [[New Guinea]]. These islands were within easy reach of the crab, and also have a suitable habitat, yet have no coconut crab population. This is due to the coconut crabs being eaten to [[extinction]] by people.  However, coconut crabs are known to live on the islands of the [[Wakatobi]] Marine National Park in [[Sulawesi]], Indonesia.

==Relationship with humans==
This hermit crab with its intimidating size and strength has a special position in the culture of many human societies which share its range. The Coconut crab is admired for its strength, and it is said{{who|date=June 2008}} that villagers use this animal to guard their coconut plantations. The coconut crab, especially if it is not yet fully grown, is also sold as a [[pet]], for example in [[Tokyo]]. The [[cage (enclosure)|cage]] must be strong enough that the animal cannot use its powerful claws to escape. Should a coconut crab pinch a person, this is not only painful but the frightened crab will usually hold fast. [[Thomas Hale Streets]] reports the following trick, used by [[Micronesia]]ns of the [[Line Islands]], to get a coconut crab to loosen its grip:

{{quote|[I]t may be interesting to know that in such a dilemma a gentle [[tickle|titillation]] of the under soft parts of the body with any light material will cause the crab to loose his hold.<ref name = streets1877 />}}

The coconut crab is eaten by the Pacific islanders, and is considered a [[gastronomy|delicacy]] and an [[aphrodisiac]], with a taste similar to [[lobster]] and crab meat. The most prized parts are the [[caviar|eggs]] inside the female coconut crab and the fat in the abdomen. Coconut crabs can be cooked in a similar way to lobsters, by boiling or steaming. Different islands also have a variety of recipes, as for example coconut crab cooked in coconut milk. While the coconut crab itself is not innately [[poisonous]], it may become so depending on its diet, and cases of coconut crab poisoning have occurred. It is believed that the poison comes from plant [[toxin]]s, which would explain why some animals are poisonous and others not. Reputedly{{Fact|date=March 2008}} this poison is considered an aphrodisiac, similar to the highly poisonous [[Tetraodontidae|pufferfish]] eaten in [[Japan]]. However, coconut crabs are not a commercial product and are usually not sold. 

Children sometimes play with coconut crabs by placing some wet [[grass]] at an angle on a palm tree that contains a coconut crab. When the animal climbs down, it believes the grass is the ground, releases its grip on the tree, and subsequently falls. 

===Status and conservation===
According to the [[IUCN Red List]] criteria, there is not enough data at present to decide if the coconut crab is an [[endangered species]], and therefore it is provisionally listed as DD (data deficient), cautioning that this assessment is in need of update.<ref name = redlist /> However, according to some reports {{Who|date=July 2007}} the populations are quite large, with one of the largest populations being on [[Caroline Island]]. It is believed that the coconut crab is quite common on some islands, but rather rare on others. Coastal development on many islands reduces the natural habitat of the crab. 

The juvenile coconut crab is vulnerable to [[Introduced species|introduced]] [[carnivore]]s such as rats and pigs, and ants such as the [[yellow crazy ant]] (''Anoplolepis gracilipes''). Adult coconut crabs have few natural [[predator]]s, and significant numbers are eaten only by people. The adults have poor [[eyesight]], and detect enemies based on ground vibration.

Overall, it seems that large human populations have a negative effect on the coconut crab population, and in some areas, populations are reported to be declining due to over-harvesting. The coconut crab is protected in some areas, with minimum sizes for taking and a protected breeding period.
