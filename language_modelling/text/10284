[[Comet]]s have been observed by humanity for thousands of years, but it is only in the past few centuries that they have been studied as [[Astronomy|astronomical]] phenomena.

== Early observations and thought ==
[[File:Tapestry of bayeux10.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|[[Halley's Comet]] appeared at [[the Battle of Hastings]] in 1066 ([[Bayeux Tapestry]]).]]

Until the sixteenth century, comets were usually considered bad [[omen]]s of deaths of kings or noble men, or coming catastrophes, or even interpreted as attacks by heavenly beings against terrestrial inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |title=Comet lore |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/halley/halley1.htm |work=A brief history of Halley's Comet |date=8 July 2008 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|p=14}}</ref> From ancient sources, such as Chinese [[oracle bone]]s, it is known that their appearances have been noticed by humans for millennia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/mulu/oracle.html |title=Chinese Oracle Bones |publisher=Cambridge University Library |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref> One very famous recording of a comet is the appearance of Halley's Comet as an terrifying omen on the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], which records the [[Norman conquest]] of England in AD 1066.<ref>{{cite web |title=Long Live the King <U+2013> Scene 1 |url=http://www.bayeuxtapestry.org.uk/Bayeux14.htm |publisher=Reading Borough Council (Reading Museum Service) |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref>

In the first book of his ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'', [[Aristotle]] propounded the view of comets that would hold sway in Western thought for nearly two thousand years. He rejected the ideas of several earlier philosophers that comets were [[planet]]s, or at least a phenomenon related to the planets, on the grounds that while the planets confined their motion to the circle of the [[Zodiac]], comets could appear in any part of the sky.<ref>{{cite book |author=Aristotle |others=Webster, E. W. (trans.) |chapter=Book I, part 6 |chapterurl=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.1.i.html |title=Meteorologica |year=350 BCE |isbn=0-8240-9601-0}}</ref> Instead, he described comets as a phenomenon of the upper [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], where hot, dry exhalations gathered and occasionally burst into flame. Aristotle held this mechanism responsible for not only comets, but also [[meteor]]s, the [[aurora borealis]], and even the [[Milky Way]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Aristotle |others=Webster, E. W. (trans.) |chapter=Book I, part 7 |chapterurl=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.1.i.html |title=Meteorologica |year=350 BCE |isbn=0-8240-9601-0}}</ref>

A few later classical philosophers did dispute this view of comets. [[Seneca the Younger]], in his ''[[Natural Questions]]'', observed that comets moved regularly through the sky and were undisturbed by the wind, behavior more typical of celestial than atmospheric phenomena. While he conceded that the other planets do not appear outside the Zodiac, he saw no reason that a planet-like object could not move through any part of the sky.<ref>{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|p=26}}</ref> However, the Aristotelian viewpoint proved more influential, and it was not until the 16th century that [[Tycho Brahe]] demonstrated that comets must exist outside the Earth's atmosphere by measuring the [[parallax]] of the [[Great Comet of 1577]] from observations collected by geographically separated observers. Within the precision of the measurements, this implied the comet must be at least four times more distant than from the Earth to the Moon.<ref name="ESO part I">{{cite web |title=A Brief History of Comets I (until 1950) |url=http://www.eso.org/public/events/astro-evt/hale-bopp/comet-history-1.html |publisher=[[European Southern Observatory]] |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|p=37}}</ref>

== Orbital studies ==
[[File:Newton Comet1680.jpg|thumb|300px|The orbit of the comet of 1680, fit to a [[parabola]], as shown in [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophi<U+00E6> Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'']]
Though comets had now been demonstrated to be in space, the question of how they moved would be debated for most of the next century. Even after [[Johannes Kepler]] had determined in 1609 that the planets moved about the Sun in [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbits, he was reluctant to believe that the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws that governed the motions of the planets]] should also influence the motion of other bodies - he believed that comets travel among the planets along straight lines, and it required [[Edmund Halley]] to prove that their orbits are in fact curved.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cse.ssl.berkeley.edu/segwayed/lessons/CometsTale/background.html |title=Comets in History |publisher=Center for Science Education at the Space Sciences Laboratory |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref> [[Galileo Galilei]], although a staunch [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanist]], rejected Tycho's parallax measurements and held to the Aristotelian notion of comets moving on straight lines through the upper atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.unipd.it/galileo/pdf/Keller.pdf |title=Comets - from Galileo to Rosetta |publisher=University of Padua |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref>

The matter was resolved by the [[C/1680 V1|bright comet]] that was discovered by [[Gottfried Kirch]] on November 14, 1680. Astronomers throughout Europe tracked its position for several months. In 1681, the [[Saxony|Saxon]] pastor [[Georg Samuel Doerfel]] set forth his proofs that comets are heavenly bodies moving in [[parabola]]s of which the Sun is the focus. Then [[Isaac Newton]], in his ''[[Philosophi<U+00E6> Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' of 1687, proved that an object moving under the influence of his [[inverse square law]] of [[gravity|universal gravitation]] must trace out an orbit shaped like one of the [[conic section]]s, and he demonstrated how to fit a comet's path through the sky to a parabolic orbit, using the comet of 1680 as an example.<ref>

In 1705, [[Edmond Halley]] (1656<U+2013>1742) applied Newton's method to twenty-three cometary apparitions that had occurred between 1337 and 1698. He noted that three of these, the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682, had very similar [[orbital element]]s, and he was further able to account for the slight differences in their orbits in terms of gravitational perturbation by [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]]. Confident that these three apparitions had been three appearances of the same comet, he predicted that it would appear again in 1758<U+2013>9.<ref name="Halley">

Halley's predicted return date was later refined by a team of three French mathematicians: [[Alexis Clairaut]], [[Joseph Lalande]], and [[Nicole-Reine Lepaute]], who predicted the date of the comet's 1759 perihelion to within one month's accuracy.<ref>{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|p=93}}</ref> When the comet returned as predicted, it became known as [[Halley's Comet]] (with the latter-day designation of 1P/Halley). It next appears in 2061.

Among the comets with short enough periods to have been observed several times in the historical record, Halley's Comet is unique in that it is consistently  bright enough to be visible to the naked eye while passing through the inner Solar System. Since the confirmation of the periodicity of Halley's Comet, quite a few other periodic comets have been discovered through the use of the  [[telescope]]. The second comet found to have a periodic orbit was [[Encke's Comet]] (with the official designation of 2P/Encke). During the period 1819<U+2013>21 the German mathematician and physicist [[Johann Franz Encke]] computed the orbits for a series of comets that had been observed in 1786, 1795, 1805, and 1818, and he concluded that they were same comet, and successfully predicted its return in 1822.<ref name="KronkEncke">{{cite web |last=Kronk |first=Gary W. |title=2P/Encke |url=http://cometography.com/pcomets/002p.html |work=Gary W.

[[Isaac Newton]] described comets as compact and durable solid bodies moving in oblique orbit and their tails as thin streams of vapor emitted by their [[Comet nucleus|nuclei]], ignited or heated by the Sun. Newton suspected that comets were the origin of the life-supporting component of air.<ref>{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|pp=306-307}}</ref> Newton also believed that the vapors given off by comets might replenish the planets' supplies of water (which was gradually being converted into soil by the growth and decay of plants) and the Sun's supply of fuel.

As early as the 18th century, some scientists had made correct hypotheses as to comets' physical composition. In 1755, [[Immanuel Kant]] hypothesized that comets are composed of some volatile substance, whose vaporization gives rise to their brilliant displays near perihelion.<ref>{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|p=85}}</ref> In 1836, the German mathematician [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]], after observing streams of vapor during the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1835, proposed that the [[jet force]]s of evaporating material could be great enough to significantly alter a comet's orbit, and he argued that the non-gravitational movements of Encke's Comet resulted from this phenomenon.<ref>{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|p=126}}</ref>

However, another comet-related discovery overshadowed these ideas for nearly a century. Over the period 1864<U+2013>1866 the Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] computed the orbit of the [[Perseids|Perseid]] [[meteor]]s, and based on orbital similarities, correctly hypothesized that the Perseids were fragments of [[Comet Swift<U+2013>Tuttle]]. The link between comets and meteor showers was dramatically underscored when in 1872, a major meteor shower occurred from the orbit of [[Comet Biela]], which had been observed to split into two pieces during its 1846 apparition, and was never seen again after 1852.<ref name="KronkBiela">{{cite web |last=Kronk |first=Gary W. |title=3D/Biela|url=http://cometography.com/pcomets/003d.html |work=Gary W. Kronk's Cometography |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref> A "gravel bank" model of comet structure arose, according to which comets consist of loose piles of small rocky objects, coated with an icy layer.<ref>{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|p=110}}</ref>

By the middle of the twentieth century, this model suffered from a number of shortcomings: in particular, it failed to explain how a body that contained only a little ice could continue to put on a brilliant display of evaporating vapor after several perihelion passages. In 1950, [[Fred Lawrence Whipple]] proposed that rather than being rocky objects containing some ice, comets were icy objects containing some dust and rock.<ref name="Whipple">{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/145272 |title=A comet model. I. The acceleration of Comet Encke |year=1950 |last1=Whipple |first1=F. L. |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=111 |pages=375}}</ref> This "dirty snowball" model soon became accepted and appeared to be supported by the observations of an armada of [[spacecraft]] (including the [[European Space Agency]]'s ''[[Giotto mission|Giotto]]'' probe and the Soviet Union's ''[[Vega 1]]'' and ''[[Vega 2]]'') that flew through the coma of Halley's Comet in 1986, photographed the nucleus, and observed jets of evaporating material.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=E4NfZ9FDcc8C&pg=PA156#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=156 |title=Magic Universe:A Grand Tour of Modern Science |isbn=9780191622359 |author1=Calder |first1=Nigel |date=2005-10-13}}</ref>
