== Cellular mechanism of action ==
Cif was first discovered by co-culturing ''P. aeruginosa'' with human airway epithelial cells and monitoring the resulting effect on chloride ion efflux across a polarized monolayer.  After co-culture, the CFTR specific chloride ion efflux was found to be drastically reduced.<ref name="Swiatecka-Urban_2006" /> This was determined to be caused by reduced levels of CFTR at the apical surface of these cells.  This effect was later found to be the result of a single secreted protein produced by ''P. aeruginosa'', which was named the CFTR inhibitory factor for this initial [[phenotype]].  Cif is secreted by ''P. aeruginosa'' PA14 as soluble protein as well as packaged into [[Secretory_vesicles#Release_of_outer_membrane_vesicles|outer membrane vesicles]] (OMV).<ref name=Bomberger_2009>{{cite journal |author=Bomberger JM, Maceachran DP, Coutermarsh BA, Ye S, O'Toole GA, Stanton BA. |title=Long-distance delivery of bacterial virulence factors by Pseudomonas aeruginosa outer membrane vesicles |journal=PLoS Pathog |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=e1000382 |year=2009 |pmid=19360133 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000382 |editor1-last=Ausubel |editor1-first=Frederick M. |pmc=2661024}}</ref>  Cif is far more potent when applied in OMVs, likely due to efficiency of delivery.

== Epoxide hydrolase enzyme mechanism ==
[[File:Cif active site.jpg|thumb|The active site of Cif is shown with a C<U+03B1> trace in gray, and side chains of select residues playing a role in catalysis are displayed as sticks. From {{PDB|3KD2}}.]]
Cif is an [[epoxide hydrolase]] (EH) with unique substrate selectivity.<ref name="Bahl_2010"/>  Cif is the first example of an EH serving as a virulence factor. Based on structural comparison, it appears that the enzyme utilizes a catalytic triad of residues Asp129, Glu153 and His297, with accessory residues His177 and Tyr239 coordinating the epoxide oxygen during ring opening.  Cif is also the first example of an EH utilizing a His-Tyr pair to coordinate an epoxide substrate, rather than the canonical Tyr-Tyr pair.<ref name=Bahl_2012>{{cite journal |author=Bahl CD, Madden DR. |title=Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cif Defines a Distinct Class of <U+03B1>/<U+03B2> Epoxide Hydrolases Utilizing a His/Tyr Ring-opening Pair |journal=Protein Pept Lett |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=186<U+2013>193 |year=2012 |pmid=21933119}}</ref> In the proposed enzyme mechanism, Asp129 nucleophilically attacks a carbon of the epoxide moiety of a substrate, forming an ester linked enzyme-acyl intermediate. The preference for which carbon is attacked varies depending upon the substrate. In the second step of the reaction, a water molecule is activated by the charge-relay His297-Glu153 pair, and undergoes nucleophilic attack on the C<U+03B3> of Asp129. This hydrolyzes the ester group, liberating the hydrolysis product as a vicinal diol.<ref name="Bahl_2010"/>

== Structure ==
Cif belongs to the [[Alpha/beta hydrolase fold|<U+03B1>/<U+03B2> hydrolase family]] of proteins.  Its structure was determined by X-ray crystallography and consists of the canonical <U+03B1>/<U+03B2> hydrolase fold with a cap domain, which it uses to constitutively homo-dimerize in solution.  The active site is burred in the interior of the protein at the interface between the <U+03B1>/<U+03B2> hydrolase core and the cap.<ref name="Bahl_2010"/><ref name=Bahl_2_2010>{{cite journal |author=Bahl CD, MacEachran DP, O'Toole GA, Madden DR. |title=Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of Cif, a virulence factor secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa |journal=Acta Crystallogr |volume=F66 |issue=1 |pages=26<U+2013>28 |year=2010 |pmid=20057063 |doi=10.1107/S1744309109047599 |pmc=2805529}}</ref>
