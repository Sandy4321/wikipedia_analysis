Aetosaur remains have been found since the early 1800s, although the very first remains that were described were mistaken for fish scales. Aetosaurs were later recognized as crocodile relatives, with early paleontologists considering them to be semiaquatic scavengers. They are now considered to have been entirely terrestrial animals. Some forms have characteristics that may have been adaptations to digging for food. There is also evidence that some if not all aetosaurs made nests.

Aetosaurs had a "pillar-erect"  erect limb posture similar to that seen in [[Rauisuchia]], a related group of Triassic archosaurs.<ref name=HL02/> A pillar-erect limb posture is one where the [[femur]] [[joint|articulates]] vertically with the [[acetabulum]] of the hip, which is angled downward, so that the leg is positioned beneath the body and acts as a pillar bearing weight. While the limb posture is similar to rauisuchians, the feet resemble those of [[phytosaur]]s (crocodile-like semiaquatic crurotarsans) in the retention of primitive characteristics.<ref name=RLC88/> Although the forelimbs are much smaller than the hind limbs, all aetosaurs were [[quadrupeds]].

==History==
Aetosaur material was first described by [[Swiss]] paleontologist [[Louis Agassiz]] in 1844. He named the genus ''Stagonolepis'' from the [[Lossiemouth Sandstone]] in [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]], [[Scotland]], but considered it to be a [[Devonian]] fish rather than a Triassic reptile. This may be because he considered the strata to be part of the [[Old Red Sandstone]], and thus [[Paleozoic]] in age. Agassiz mistook the osteoderms for large rhomboidal scales, which he thought were arranged in a similar pattern to those of [[gar]]s. He also thought that these supposed scales were very similar to those of the [[lobe-finned fish]] ''[[Megalichthys]]'' due to their large size.<ref name=AL44>{{cite book |last=Agassiz |first=L. |year=1844 |title=[http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/26658#7 Monographie des poisons fossils du Vieux Gr<U+00E9>s Rouge ou Syst<U+00E9>me D<U+00E9>vonien (Old Red Sandstone) des Iles Britanniques ed de Russie] |publisher=Jent et Gassman |location=Neuch<U+00E2>tel |pages=171}}</ref>

[[English people|English]] biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] reconsidered the fish scales described by Agassiz and considered them to belong to a crocodilian. He first proposed this to the [[Geological Society of London]] in 1858, and went into more detail in an 1875 paper in the society's quarterly journal. By this time, new material had been uncovered from Elgin that indicated that ''Stagonolepis'' was not a fish, but a reptile. However, ''Stagonolepis'' was still known primarily by scutes and imprints of scutes, many of which were not well preserved.<ref name=HTH75>{{cite journal |last=Huxley |first=T.H. |year=1875 |title=On ''Stagonolepis Robertsoni'', and on the evolution of the Crocodilia |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society |volume=31 |pages=423-438 |doi=10.1144/GSL.JGS.1875.031.01-04.29}}</ref>

More complete aetosaur remains were found from the [[Lower Stubensandtein]] of [[Germany]] in the 1870s. Among them were complete articulated skeletons of 22 aetosaurs. These specimens were found in a large sandstone [[outcrop]] near [[Stuttgart]] and were preserved together in an area less than 2 square metres in size. The animals were probably buried under lake sediment soon after they died, with the flow of water repositioning their bodies on the lake bed and putting them in close proximity to one another. In 1877, German paleontologist [[Oskar Fraas]] assigned these specimens to the newly erected genus ''Aetosaurus''. Fraas named the genus after the skull's resemblance to the head of an eagle, with a narrow, elongate skull and a pointed snout.<ref name=FO77>{{cite journal |last=Fraas |first=O. |year=1877 |title=''Aetosaurus ferratus'' Fr.

The first aetosaurs from North America were also being described at this time. American paleontologist [[Edward Drinker Cope]] named ''Typothorax'' in 1875 and ''Episcoposaurus'' in 1877, both of which were from [[New Mexico]]. However, Cope considered these genera to be phytosaurs, crocodile-like aquatic archosaurs that were also common in the Late Triassic. While new material referable to ''Typothorax'' has been found in recent years throughout the American southwest, ''Episcoposaurus'' is no longer considered valid. Cope, along with later paleontologists such as [[Friedrich von Huene]], recognized that remains of the [[type species]] ''E. horridus'' actually belonged to ''Typothorax''. Another species, ''E. haplocerus'', was reassigned to ''Desmatosuchus'' in 1953.<ref name=GJT53>{{cite journal |last=Gregory |first=J.T. |year=1953 |title=[http://www.peabody.yale.edu/scipubs/bulletins_postillas/ypmP016_1953.pdf ''Typothorax'' and ''Desmatosuchus''] |journal=Postilla, Peabody Museum of Natural History Bulletin |issue=16 |pages=1-27}}</ref>

[[Image:Stegomus arcuatus Marsh.JPG|thumb|right|Photograph of the carapace of ''Stegomus'', described by Marsh in 1896]]
A third North American genus called ''Stegomus'' was named by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] in 1896.<ref name=MOC96>{{cite journal |last=Marsh |first=O.C. |year=1896 |title=A new belodont reptile (''Stegomus'') from the Connecticut River Sandstone |journal=American Journal of Science |volume=2 |pages=59-62}}</ref> Marsh had a long-time rivalry with Cope that was made famous in the [[Bone Wars]] of the late 1800s, in which the two tried to out-compete one another in the field and in scientific literature. Unlike Cope's aetosaurs, ''Stegomus'' was found from the eastern United States in [[Connecticut]]. Marsh also recognized ''Stegomus'' as an aetosaur rather than a phytosaur in his initial description of the genus. Like Cope, many paleontologists tended to consider aetosaur scutes to belong to phytosaurs during this time period.<ref name=Chinleana2/>

Aetosauria was first named in 1889 by English [[naturalist]] [[Richard Lydekker]] and [[zoologist]] [[Henry Alleyne Nicholson]].<ref name=NL89>{{cite book |last=Nicholson |first=H.A. |coauthors=and Lydekker, R. |year=1889 |chapter=Order Crocodilia |title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=bMBDAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&q&f=false A manual of palaeontology for the use of students, with a general introduction on the principles of palaeontology] |volume=II |publisher=''Nature'' |pages=1180-1196}}</ref> They considered Aetosauria to be one of three [[suborder]]s of the order Crocodilia, the other two being [[Parasuchia]] (a Triassic group) and [[Eusuchia]] (a group including all post-Triassic crocodiles). At the time, Cope considered Aetosauria to belong to [[Rhynchocephalia]], an order of reptiles that includes the living [[tuatara]]. He also thought that the tightly fitting osteoderms, which were thought to be fused to the ribs, indicated that aetosaurs were transitional between rhynchocephalians and [[turtle]]s.<ref name=NL89/> Nicholson and Lydekker placed a single family within the suborder, A<U+00EB>tosaurid<U+00E6>. They considered aetosaurs to be similar to living crocodilians apart from their elongated [[metatarsal]]s, which were compared to those of dinosaurs. In fact, Marsh considered aetosaurs to be closely related to dinosaurs because both had similar metatarsals.<ref name=NL89/> 

Aetosaur material continued to be described into the early 1900s, with noteable paleontologists such as [[Barnum Brown]] and [[Charles Camp]] collecting specimens.<ref name=Chinleana3>{{cite web |url=http://chinleana.blogspot.com/2009/08/who-has-worked-on-aetosaurs.html |title=Who Has Worked on Aetosaurs? |first=Bill |last=Parker |date=9 August 2009 |work=Chinleana  |publisher=Blogspot  |accessdate=24 July 2010}}</ref> However, aetosaur remains were still being confused with those of phytosaurs. During this time, aetosaurs were usually considered to be members of [[Pseudosuchia]], a now obsolete group consisting of various Triassic archosaurs including phytosaurs. However, similarities were often observed between aetosaurs and Crocodilia, the group to which aetosaurs were initially referred in the 1800s. While the skull had many features in common with pseudosuchians, parts of the postcranial skeleton, in particular the scutes, seemed to be similar to those of crocodilians.<ref name=SHJ47>{{cite journal |last=Sawin |first=H.J. |year=1947 |title=The pseudosuchian reptile ''Typothorax meadei'' |journal=Journal of Paleontology |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=201<U+2013>238}}</ref>

== Classification ==
===Taxonomy===
Aetosaurs belong to [[Crurotarsi]], a clade of archosaurs that includes living crocodilians and is characterized by the distinctive structure of the [[tarsus|ankle bones]]. Aetosaurs were traditionally referred to a (now obsolete) group called the [[thecodont]]s, which included all "[[basal (phylogenetics)|primitive]]" crocodilian relatives that lived in the Triassic. With the rise of  [[phylogenetics]], aetosaurs were later placed in a group called [[Suchia]], which included many Triassic crurotarsans as well as later crurotarsans, including crocodilians.<ref name=Betal10>{{cite journal |last=Brusatte |first=S.L. |coauthors=Benton, M.J.; Desojo, J.B.; and Langer, M.C. |year=2010 |title=[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a919837956&fulltext=713240928 The higher-level phylogeny of Archosauria (Tetrapoda: Diapsida)] |journal=Journal of Systematic Palaeontology |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=3<U+2013>47 |doi=10.1080/14772010903537732}}</ref>  

All aetosaurs are members of the family Stagonolepidae. Stagonolepidae is split into two subfamilies, Aetosaurinae and Desmatosuchinae. Aetosaurinae is characterized by projections called eminences on the dorsal paramedian osteoderms that are close to the midline of the back. Desmatosuchinae has a few more distinguishing characteristics, including grooves on the dorsal paramedians that help them lock to the lateral plates in a tight articulation. Many desmatosuchines have long spikes projecting from the lateral plates. These spikes are especially prominent in ''Desmatosuchus''. Aetosaurines, on the other hand, tend to have less spikes. Many aetosaurines, such as ''Aetosaurus'' and ''Neoaetosauroides'', have smooth carapaces and lack spikes altogether.<ref name=PWG07/>

===Phylogeny===
Aetosaur [[phylogeny]] was first investigated in 1994 by [[paleontologist]] [[J. Michael Parrish]]. ''Aetosauroides'', ''Aetosaurus'', ''Desmatosuchus'', ''Longosuchus'', ''Neoaetosauroides'', ''Stagonolepis'', and ''Typothorax'' were included in the phylogenetic analysis. Aetosaurs were found to form a [[clade]] with rauisuchians, which Parrish termed Rauisuchiformes. Rauisuchiformes also included the superorder [[Crocodylomorpha]], to which living [[crocodilia]]ns belong. Parrish found Aetosauria to be a [[monophyletic]] group and thus a true clade consisting of a common aetosaur ancestor and all of its descendants. To phylogenetically define Aetosauria, Parrish identified five [[synapomorphies]], or shared characteristics. The first synapomorphy concerned the jaw, with the [[premaxilla]] at its tip being edentulous, upturned, and wide to form a "shovel". Moreover, the [[dentary bone]] in the lower jaw is also toothless, upturned, and broad. The reduced size and simple conical shape of the teeth was considered another synapomorphy. Two more synapomorphies of aetosaurs are shared with crocodylomorphs, but were not considered to be an indication of a close phylogenetic relationship; the body is covered in dorsal and ventral armor to form a complete carapace, and the paramedian osteoderms are much wider than they are long, with distinctive pitting. A final synapomorphy was found in the structure of the limb bones. In all aetosaurs, the limbs are very robust, with large muscle attachments such as the deltopectoral crest of the [[humerus]], the [[fourth trochanter]] of the [[femur]], the intracondylar ridge of the [[tibia]], and the iliofibularis trochanter of the [[fibula]].<ref name=PJM94>{{cite journal |last=Parrish |first=J.M. |year=1994 |title=Cranial osteology of ''Longosuchus meadei'' and the phylogeny and distribution of the Aetosauria |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=196<U+2013>209}}</ref>

In Parrish's phylogenetic analysis, ''Aetosaurus'' was found to be the most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] member of the clade, the earliest to diverge after the [[most recent common ancestor]]. After ''Aetosaurus'', there is a [[polytomy]] of three smaller clades in which it is unknown which clade diverged first from the group. Within this polytomy there was ''Neoaetosauroides'', a clade containing ''Aetosauroides'' and ''Stagonolepis'', and another polytomy that included ''Longosuchus'', ''Desmatosuchus'', and a clade containing ''Paratypothorax'' and ''Typothorax''. Below is the [[cladogram]] produced from the analysis of Parrish (1994):<ref name=PJM94/>

         |3=''Neoaetosauroides'' 
}} }} }} }}

A later study by paleontologists [[Andrew B. Heckert]] and [[Spencer G. Lucas]] in 1999 expanded the number of synapomorphies that diagnose Aetosauria to 18. New synapomorphies included [[temporal fenestra]]e, or holes, that opened on the side of the skull rather than the top, lateral osteoderms articulating with the paramedians, and osteoderms covering the limbs. ''Aetosaurus'' was still found to be the most basal member, but the phylogeny of more [[derived]] aetosaurs differed in that ''Typothorax'' and ''Paratypothorax'' were split into two different clades with their [[sister taxa]] being ''Desmatosuchus'' and ''Longosuchus'', respectively. More importantly, a new aetosaur called ''Coahomasuchus'' was included in the analysis. ''Coahomasuchus'' was found to be a basal aetosaur closely related to ''Stagonolepis'', and also appeared early in the fossil record of aetosaurs. Previously, basal members were only known from later times, occurring after more advanced aetosaurs.<ref name=HL99/>

In 2003, paleontologists [[Simon R. Harris]], [[David J. Gower]], and [[Mark Wilkinson (paleontologist)|Mark Wilkinson]] examined previous phylogenetic studies of aetosaurs and criticized the way in which they used certain characters to produce cladograms. They concluded that only three hypotheses of aetosaur relationships from previous studies were still true: that ''Aetosaurus'' is the most basal aetosaur, that ''Aetosauroides'' is the sister taxon of ''Stagonolepis robertsoni'', and that ''Longosuchus'' and ''Desmatosuchus'' are more closely related to each other than either is to ''Neoaetosauroides''. They also went on to correct the trees from all previous analyses.<ref name=HGW03>{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=S.R. |coauthors=Gower, D.J.; and Wilkinson, M. |year=2002 |title=[http://www.bmnh.org/PDFs/SH_03_homology.pdf Intraorganismal homology, character construction, and the phylogeny of aetosaurian archosaurs (Reptilia, Diapsida)] |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=239-252 |doi=10.1080/10635150390192735}}</ref>

More recently, a 2007 analysis by paleontologist [[William G. Parker]] resulted in a larger tree of aetosaur phylogenetics with the inclusion of ''Heliocanthus''. Based on the tree, Parker defined the clades [[Typothoracisinae]] and [[Paratypothoracisini]], both within Aetosaurinae. Parker also gave a revised phylogenetic definition of Aetosauria, mentioning that the previous definition, made by Heckert and Lucas in 2000, was somewhat ambiguous.<ref name=PWG07/> Heckert & Lucas (2000) defined Aetosauria as a [[stem-based taxon]], claiming that Aetosauria included all crurotarsans that were more closely related to ''Desmatosuchus'' than to the immediate sister group of Aetosauria.<ref name=HL00>{{cite journal |last=Heckert |first=A. B. |coauthors=and Lucas, S. G. |year=2000 |title=Taxonomy, phylogeny, biostratigraphy, biochronology, paleobiogeography, and evolution of the Late Triassic Aetosauria (Archosauria: Crurotarsi). |journal=Zentralblatt f<U+00FC>r Geologie und Pal<U+00E4>ontologie, Teil I, Heft |volume=11-12 |pages=1539<U+2013>1587}}</ref> Because the immediate sister group of Aetosauria was uncertain, Parker offered a new definition with several non-aetosaur crurotarsan genera rather than one sister group. According to Parker, Aetosauria included all taxa more closely related to ''Aetosaurus'' and ''Desmatosuchus'' than to ''[[Leptosuchus]]'', ''[[Postosuchus]]'', ''[[Prestosuchus]]'', ''[[Poposaurus]]'', ''[[Sphenosuchus]]'', ''[[Alligator]]'', ''[[Gracilisuchus]]'', and ''[[Revueltosaurus]]''.<ref name=PWG07/>

In 2008, Parker, along with [[Michelle R. Stocker]] and [[Randall B. Irmis]], conducted a new phylogenetic analysis which included the newly described ''Sierritasuchus''. Below is the cladogram from Parker ''et al.'' (2008):<ref name=PSI08/>

==Paleobiology==
===Early interpretations===
In 1904, American paleontologist [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] described aetosaurs as carnivorous aquatic animals of the order Parasuchia, mentioning that "[Parasuchia] constitutes an independent order, probably freshwater, littoral, carnivorous, short snouted (A<U+00EB>tosaurus) or long snouted (Phytosaurus, Mystriosuchus) forms, analogous in their habits to the modern Crocodilia".<ref name=OHF04>{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/278383 |last=Osborn |first=H.F. |year=1904 |title=Reclassification of the reptilia |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=38 |issue=446 |pages=93<U+2013>115}}</ref> Early aetosaur remains were often found in clays beside skeletons of aquatic animals such as phytosaurs and terrestrial animals such as [[dinosaur]]s and [[trilophosaur]]s. This may have led some paleontologists to believe that the animals had died in swampy environments. Because there were a large number of skeletons of animals that would not normally have inhabited swamps in these clays, some paleontologists even suggested that aetosaurs scavenged off the carcasses of animals that became trapped in the swamps and died. Doubts were later raised over this lifestyle, since aetosaur teeth show little indication of carnivory and the weight of the armor suggests that aetosaurs had "a passive mode of life." However, aetosaurs were still regarded as partly aquatic into the mid 1900s.<ref name=SHJ47/>

===Feeding===
Aetosaurs were herbivores, likely feeding on [[fern]]s and [[seed fern]]s that were common in the Triassic. The upturned shape of their snout suggests that aetosaurs may have dug up roots and tubers.<ref name=ucmp>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/pseudosuchia/aetosauria.html |title=Introduction to the Aetosauria |first=K. |last=Ziehn |coauthors=Sangalang, E.; Fritz-Laylin, L.; Twu, C.; Huynh, A.; and Smith, D. |date=1 May 2000 |work=University of California Museum of Paleontology - History of life through time |publisher=Regents of the University of California |accessdate=18 August 2010}}</ref> Aetosaurs have several anatomical features that may have been adaptations to digging, including a short radius relative to the humerus (seen in many other digging tetrapods) and a large deltopectoral crest on the humerus that served as an attachment for muscles. Aetosaurs also have large hind feet, or [[pes (zoology)|pes]], with large claws that were likely used for skratch-digging. One aetosaur, ''Typothorax'', has an entepicondyle on the humerus, which is the origin of forearm [[Pronation|pronator]] and manual flexor muscles often used in digging. Moreover, it has a large  [[olecranon process]] on the ulna which projects backward past the elbow, giving a large area for the insertion of the [[triceps]] muscle.<ref name=Hetal10>{{cite journal |last=Heckert |first=A.B. |coauthors=Lucas, S.G.; Rinehart, L.F.; Celesky, M.D.; Spielmann, J.A.; and Hunt, A.P. |year=2010 |title=[http://pdfserve.informaworld.com/852191__922419027.pdf Articulated skeletons of the aetosaur ''Typothorax coccinarum'' Cope (Archosauria: Stagonolepididae) from the Upper Triassic Bull Canyon Formation (Revueltian: early-mid Norian), eastern New Mexico, USA] |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=619<U+2013>642 |doi=10.1080/02724631003763524}}</ref> While many studies have suggested that aetosaurs had a [[fossorial]] or burrowing lifestyle,<ref name=PJM94/> aetosaurs have few of the characteristics that fossorial animals have as adaptations to digging. Therefore, it is likely that aetosaurs were able to dig to some extent, possibly rooting for food, but were unable to burrow.<ref name=Hetal10/>

While features of the limbs indicate that aetosaurs probably dug for food, features of the skull and teeth can indicate what kind of food they were eating. Aetosaurs have many derived features not seen in other crurotarsans which indicate that they are adapted to a different diet. Unlike the sharp, recurved teeth of other triassic archosaurs, aetosaurs had simple, conical teeth. The tips of the jaws were [[edentulism|edentulous]], or toothless, and probably supported a beak.
The teeth have very little wear, suggesting that aetosaurs did not consume stiff and tough plant material. It is more likely that they consumed non-abrasive vegetation such as soft leaves.<ref name=PJM94/>

Alternative theories have been proposed for the diet of aetosaurs. In 1947, [[H J Sawin]] proposed that the aetosaur ''Longosuchus'' was a scavenger based on the close proximity of some specimens to a large number of skeletons that were likely carcasses.<ref name=SHJ47/> A 2009 study of the jaw biomechanics of the South American genus ''Neoaetosauroides'' suggested that the animal may have fed on larvae and insects without hard exoskeletons. This is because ''Neoaetosauroides'' lacks serrations or wear facets on the teeth and has a jaw leverage that is not designed for strong forces such as crushing and chopping. The study recognized that northern aetosaurs such as ''Desmatosuchus'' and ''Stagonolepis'' did have jaws that would have supported a strong musculature, and were likely better suited to eating plant material.<ref name=DV09/>

===Nests===
[[File:Desmatosuchus BW.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Life restoration of ''Desmatosuchus haplocerus''. This is likely the animal that made the nests discovered there  in 1996.]]
At least some aetosaurs  built nests and protected their eggs. In 1996, geologist [[Stephen Hasiotis]] discovered 220&nbsp;million-year-old, fossilized, bowl-like nests in Arizona's Petrified Forest, in part of the [[Chinle Formation]]. The oldest such nests that have been found belonged to [[phytosaur]]s and aetosaurs. The nests are compacted and appear very similar to the nests of the modern day [[crocodile]]s who guard their nests. The nests were holes dug in the sand in the bank of an ancient river.<ref name=ucmp/>

A second possible aetosaur nest site is known from northeastern Italy. The nests are preserved as depressions in [[carbonate]] rock that are circular or horseshoe-shaped, with high ridges around the sides. They appear to be unusually complex for nests created by Triassic reptiles. Archosaur footprints were found nearby that resembled aetosaurs, although they were not present in the same layer. Because the tracks were found so close to the nests, it is likely that aetosaurs built them.<ref name=Aetal07>{{cite journal |last=Avanzini |first=M. |coauthors=Dalla vecchia, F.M.; Mietto, P: Piubelli, D; Preto, N; Rigo, M; and Roghi, G  |year=2007 |title=A vertebrate nesting site in northeastern Italy reveals unexpectedly complex behavior for late Carnian reptiles |journal=Palaios |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=465-475 |doi=10.2110/palo.2005.p05-137r}}</ref>

==Biochronology==
Because species of aetosaurs typically have restricted fossil ranges and are abundant in the strata they are found in, they are useful in [[biochronology]]. Osteoderms are the most common remains associated with aetosaurs, so a single identifiable scute can accurately date the layer it is found in.

One aetosaur, ''Typothorax coccinarum'', has been used to define the [[Revueltian]] [[land vertebrate faunachron]]. A land vertebrate faunachron (LVF) is a time interval that is defined by the first appearance datum (FAD), or first occurance, of a [[tetrapod]] index fossil and is commonly used to date Late Triassic and [[Early Jurassic]] terrestrial strata.<ref name=LSG91>{{cite journal |last=Lucas |first=S.G. |year=1991 |title=Sequence stratigraphic correlation of nonmarine and marine Late Triassic biochronologies, western United States |journal=Albertiana |volume=9 |pages=11-18}}</ref><ref name=LH93>{{cite book |last=Lucas |first=S.G. |coauthors=and Hunt, A.P. |year=1993 |chapter=[http://econtent.unm.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/bulletins&CISOPTR=1180&REC=4 Tetrapod biochronology of the Chinle Group (Upper Triassic), western United States] |title=The Nonmarine Triassic |editors=Lucas, S.G. and Morales, M.

Biochrons for aetosaur genera have been developed for dating strata in the [[Chinle Group]] of the southwestern United States. Up to 13 genera of aetosaurs are known from the Chinle Group, with most occurring in multiple localities and over short time spans. In 1996, paleontologists [[Spencer G. Lucas]] and [[Andrew B. Heckert]] recognized five biochrons based on the presence of aetosaurs throughout the Chinle Group.<ref name=LH96>{{cite journal |last=Lucas |first=S.G. |coauthors=and Heckert, A.B. |year=1996 |title=Late Triassic aetosaur biochronology |journal=Albertiana |volume=17 |pages=57-64}}</ref> The number of biochrons grew to 11 in a 2007 study by Heckert and Lucas along with [[Adrian P. Hunt]] and [[Justin A. Spielmann]]. These biochrons occurred from the [[Otischalkian]] LVF to the Apachean LVF and included genera such as ''Longosuchus'', ''Tecovasuchus'', and ''Typothorax''.<ref name=Hetal07/>

==Naming controversy==
{{main|Heliocanthus|Redondasuchus}}
In 2007, paleontologists at the [[New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] were accused of [[plagiarism]] in some of their published articles dealing with aetosaurs. In late 2006, the genus ''Rioarribasuchus'' was erected as a replacement name for ''"Desmatosuchus" chamaensis'' in the museum's bulletin.<ref name=LHS06>{{cite book |last=Lucas |first=S.G. |coauthors=Hunt, A.P.; and Spielmann, J.A. |year=2006 |chapter=''Rioarribasuchus'', a new name for an aetosaur from the Upper Triassic of north-central New Mexico |title=The Triassic-Jurassic Terrestrial Transition |editors=Harris ''et al.'' |series=New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin |publisher=New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science |location=Albuquerque |pages=37}}</ref> However, four years earlier paleontologist [[William Parker (paleontologist)|William Parker]] reassigned ''"D." chamaensis'' to the newly named genus ''Heliocanthus'' in an unpublished thesis.<ref name=PWG03>{{cite thesis |degree=M.Sc. |title=Description of a new specimen of ''Desmatosuchus haplocerus'' from the Late Triassic of Northern Arizona |last=Parker |first=W.G. |year=2003 |publisher=Northern Arizona University |location=Flagstaff |pages=315}}</ref> Because the name was not published, it was considered a ''[[nomen nudum]]'' until 2007 when it was described in the ''[[Journal of Systematic Palaeontology]]''.<ref name=PWG07/> The authors of the 2006 paper, Spencer G. Lucas, Adrian P. Hunt, and Justin A. Spielmann, were accused of "intellectual theft" by paleontologists [[Jeff Martz]], [[Mike Taylor (paleontologist)|Mike Taylor]], [[Matt Wedel]], and [[Darren Naish]], who claimed that they knew that Parker was eventually going to redescribe the species and formally erect a new genus. According to Martz, Taylor, Wedel, and Naish, the authors rushed to publish their own name before Parker could publish his.<ref name=MTWN08>{{cite web |url=http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/nm/timeline.html |title=Timeline of publications and letters |first=Jeff |last=Martz |coauthors= Taylor, Mark; Wedel, Matt; and Naish, Darren |date=1 June 2008 |work=Aetogate: asking for answers in New Mexico |accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref>

Another controversy occurred after Spielmann, Hunt, and Lucas published a 2006 paper mentioning that the [[holotype]] of ''Redondasuchus'' was not a left paramedian but a right one.<ref name=Setal06>{{cite book |last=Spielmann |first=J.A. |coauthors=Hunt, A.P.; Lucas, S.G.; and Heckert, A.B. |year=2006 |chapter=[http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/nm/SpielmannEtAl2006-revision-of-redondasuchus.pdf Revision of ''Redondasuchus'' (Archosauria: Aetosauria) from the Upper Triassic Redonda Formation, New Mexico, with description of a new species |title=The Triassic-Jurassic Terrestrial Transition] |editors=Harris, H.D.; Lucas, S.G.; Spielmann, J.A.; Lockley, M.G.; Milner, A.R.C.; and Kirkland, J.L. |publisher=New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin |volume=37 |pages=583-587}}</ref> In 2002, Martz came to the same conclusion in an unpublished thesis.<ref name=MJW02>{{Cite thesis |degree=M.Sc. |title=The morphology and ontogeny of ''Typothorax coccinarum'' (Archosauria Stagonolepididae) from the Upper Triassic of the American Southwest |url=http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/nm/Martz2002-thesis.pdf |last=Martz |first=J.W. |year=2002 |publisher= Texas Tech University |accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref> He, along with Taylor, Wedel, and Naish, claimed that this was another form of plagiarism.<ref name=MTWN08/>

These allegations were brought to the attention of the Ethics Education Committee of the [[Society of Vertebrate Paleontology]] (SVP) in 2007, and a response was given in 2008. In regard to ''Redondasuchus'', the SVP found no plagiarism involved, while in the case of ''Heliocanthus'' and ''Rioarribasuchus'', the SVP did not try to resolve the issue.<ref name=SVP08>{{cite journal |year=2008 |title=[http://www.vertpaleo.org/society/documents/ExecutiveCommitteestatement.pdf Statement from the Executive Committee about the allegations of unethical conduct from J. Martz, W. Parker, M. Taylor and M. Wedel against S. Lucas, A. Hunt, A. Heckert, and J. Spielmann] |publisher=Society of Vertebrate Paleontology}}</ref>

The entire controversy came to be known as "Aetogate", in reference to the famous [[Watergate scandal]] of the 1970s.<ref name=MTWN08/> It received wide attention from local Albuquerque newspapers and science blogs.<ref name=MTWN10>{{cite web |url=http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/nm/ |title=Press Coverage |first=Jeff |last=Martz |coauthors= Taylor, Mark; Wedel, Matt; and Naish, Darren |date=17 February 2010 |work=Aetogate: asking for answers in New Mexico |accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref> It was also the focus of a news article in a 2008 issue of the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.<ref name=DR08>{{cite journal |last=Dalton |first=R. |year=2008 |title=[http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080130/full/451510a.html Fossil reptiles mired in controversy] |journal=Nature |volume=451 |pages=510 |doi=10.1038/451510a}}</ref>
