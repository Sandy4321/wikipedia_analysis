'''Multilevel Coordinate Search''' ('''MSC''') is an [[algorithm]] for bound constrained [[global optimization]] using [[function (mathematics)|function]] values only.

To do so, the n-dimensional [[search space]] is represented by a set of non-intersecting hypercubes (boxes). The boxes are then iteratively split along an axis plane according to the value of the function at a representative point of the box and the box's size. These two splitting criteria combine to form a global search by splitting large boxes and a local search by splitting areas for which the function value is good.

Additionally a local search combining a quadratic interpolant of the function and [[line search]]es can be used to augment performance of the algorithm.
