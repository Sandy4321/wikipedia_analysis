'''Othona''' or '''Othonae''' was the name of an ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] fort of the [[Saxon Shore]] at the location of the modern village [[Bradwell-on-Sea]] in [[Essex]], [[England]]. The [[Anglo-Saxon]] name ''Ythanceaster'' for the locality derives from the Roman name.<ref>''CBA Report 18: The Saxon Shore'', p. 8</ref>

==History==
The fort of Othona is in a typical late 3rd century style, and was possibly constructed in during or shortly prior to the [[Carausian Revolt]], making it contemporary with the forts at ''[[Dubris]]'', ''[[Portus Lemanis]]'' and ''[[Garrianum]]''<ref>Fields, p. 24</ref> According to the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'', which is the only contemporary document mentioning Othona, the fort was garrisoned by a ''numerus Fortensium'' ("[[numerus]] of the brave ones").<ref>''Notitia Dignitatum, Pars Occ.'', XXVIII.13</ref>

==Location and construction==
Othona's location at the edge of the [[Dengie peninsula]] was ideal for control of the estuaries of the rivers [[River Blackwater, Essex|Blackwater]] and [[River Colne, Essex|Colne]], the latter leading to the important city of ''[[Camulodunum]]'' ([[Colchester]]).<ref>Fields, pp. 29-32</ref> The fort's shape is roughly [[trapezoid]]al, with rounded corners. The stone rampart was 4.2 meters thick, indicating a tall superstructure, and enclosed over 2 ha. A single exterior ditch surrounded the site. Although some of the Roman building material was re-used in the 7th century church of [[St Peter-on-the-Wall]], enough of the rampart survived until the 17th century, when it was described by [[Philemon Holland]] as a "huge ruin".<ref>Fields, p. 32</ref>
