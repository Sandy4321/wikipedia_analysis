==Life==
He was born in London in November 1625, and was educated at Cambridge, initially at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]] and subsequently (1644) at [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens' College]]. In 1647 he proceeded B.A.<ref>{{acad|id=BTS643W|name=Bates, William}}</ref> He was a presbyterian. His first living was [[St. Dunstan's-in-the-West]], London, and he remained as vicar until the [[Act of Uniformity 1662]] was passed, when he was ejected. He also took part with other evangelical clergy in carrying on a lecture series in [[Cripplegate]] church under the name of 'Morning Exercise.'

In the negotiations for the restoration of Charles II, Bates took part. Royal favour came to him, and he was appointed one of the royal chaplains. In 1660 he acted as one of the commissioners of the [[Savoy conference]]. In 1661 Cambridge conferred on him the degree of D.D. by royal mandate. At the same time he was urged to accept the deanery of Lichfield and Coventry, but like [[Richard Baxter]], [[Edmund Calamy the elder]], [[Thomas Manton]], and others in their position, he declined office. Later, Bates conducted the discussion between the nonconformists and [[John Pearson (bishop)|John Pearson]], [[Peter Gunning]], and [[Anthony Sparrow]]. In 1665 Bates took the oath imposed by the parliament which met at Oxford 'that he would not at any time endeavour an alteration in the government of church or state.' In this he was supported by [[John Howe (puritan)|John Howe]] and [[Matthew Poole]], although Richard Baxter refused it.

In 1668 some of the more moderate churchmen endeavoured to work out a scheme of comprehension that would bring presbyterians back into the [[Church of England]]. In this Bates, Baxter, and Manton co-operated. But no agreement could be reached. A little later he joined in the presentation of a petition to the king for 'relief of nonconformists.' His majesty received him graciously, but nothing came of it. Again in 1674, under the conduct of [[John Tillotson]] and [[Edward Stillingfleet]], a fresh effort was made towards comprehension through Bates, but once more nothing came of it. After the accession of James II, the disabilities and sufferings of the nonconformists increased. Bates was at Baxter's side when [[George Jeffreys]] browbeat and insulted Baxter and his associates. He s successfully interceded with Archbishop Tillotson in behalf of [[Nathaniel, Lord Crewe]], bishop of Durham, who had been excepted from the act of indemnity of 1690.

On the accession of William III and Mary, Bates delivered two speeches to their majesties on behalf of the dissenters. In the last years of his life he was pastor of the presbyterian church of [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]]. He died there 14 July 1699, aged seventy-four, having outlived and preached the funeral sermons of Baxter, Manton, [[Thomas Jacomb]], and [[David Clarkson (minister)|David Clarkson]].  As a preacher he was held to be 'silver-tongued' and the 'politest' of all the nonconformists. John Howe's funeral sermon to Bates's memory was printed with Bates's works.
