[[General]] '''Sir Henry Clinton''', [[Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath|KB]] (16 April 1730 <U+2013> 23 December 1795) was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] army officer and politician, best known for his service as a general during the [[American War of Independence]].  First arriving in [[Boston]] in May 1775, from 1778 to 1782 he was the British [[Commander-in-Chief, North America|Commander-in-Chief]] in North America. In addition to his military service, due to the influence of the [[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 2nd Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne|2nd Duke of Newcastle]], he was a Member of Parliament for many years.  Late in life he was named [[Governor of Gibraltar]], but died before assuming the post.

He came from a noble family that could trace its lineage to 1066 and had a long history of service to the Crown. The son of [[George Clinton (Royal Navy officer)|George Clinton]], an [[admiral of the fleet]], Henry had two sons who continued the family tradition of high command: General Sir [[William Henry Clinton]] (1769<U+2013>1846), and Lieutenant-General Sir [[Henry Clinton (Napoleonic Wars)|Henry Clinton]] (1771<U+2013>1829).

==Early life==
Henry Clinton was born, probably in 1730, to Admiral [[George Clinton (royal governor)|George Clinton]]
and Anne Carle, the daughter of a general.<ref name=W5>Willcox, p. 5</ref>  Early histories claimed his birth year as 1738, a date widely propagated even in modern biographic summaries;{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} according to biographer William Willcox, Clinton claimed in a notebook found in 1958 to be born in 1730, and that evidence from English peerage records places the date of birth as 16 April.<ref name=W5/>  Willcox also notes that none of these records give indication of the place of Clinton's birth.<ref name=W6>Willcox, p. 6</ref>  Historian John Fredriksen claims that Clinton was born in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]];<ref>Fredriksen, p. 107</ref> his father was posted there from 1732 to 1738.<ref name=W5/>

Little is known of the earliest years of Clinton's life, or of his mother and the two sisters that survived to adulthood.<ref name=W5/>  Given his father's naval career, where the family was domiciled is uncertain.  They were not obviously well-connected to the seat of the [[Earls of Lincoln]], from whom his father was descended, or the estate of the [[Dukes of Newcastle]], to whom they were related by marriage.<ref name=W6/>  In 1739 his father, then stationed at [[Gibraltar]], applied for the governorship of the [[Province of New York]]; he won the post in 1741 with the assistance of the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]] (who was his brother's [[brother-in-law]]).<ref>Willcox, p. 7</ref>  However, he did not actually go to New York until 1743; he took young Henry with him, having failed to acquire a lieutenant's commission for the 12-year-old.<ref name=W8>Willcox, p. 8</ref>  Henry's career would also benefit from the family connection to the Newcastles.<ref name=W9>Willcox, p. 9</ref>

Records of the family's life in New York are sparse.  He is reported to have studied under [[Samuel Seabury (1729<U+2013>1796)|Samuel Seabury]] on [[Long Island]], suggesting the family may have lived in the country outside [[New York City]].<ref name=W9/>  Clinton's first military commission was to an independent company in New York in 1745.  The next year his father procured for him a captain's commission, and he was assigned to garrison duty at the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|recently captured]] [[Fortress Louisbourg]].<ref name=W9/>  In 1749, Clinton went to Britain to pursue his military career.  It was two years before he received a commission as a [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] in the [[Coldstream Guards]].<ref>Willcox, p. 10</ref>  His father, after he returned to London when his term as New York governor was over, procured for Clinton a position as aide to Sir [[John Ligonier]] in 1756.<ref>Willcox, p. 13</ref>

===Seven Years War===
{{Further2|[[Great Britain in the Seven Years War]]}}
By 1758 had risen to be a [[Lieutenant-Colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]] in the [[Grenadier Guards|1st Foot Guards]], which was later renamed the Grenadier Guards.  Despite the ongoing [[Seven Years' War]], Clinton was not called into a campaign until 1760.<ref>Willcox, p. 17</ref>  That year he was sent to Europe, where he saw action under [[Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick|Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick]] at [[Battle of Corbach|Corbach]] and [[Battle of Kloster Kampen|Kloster Kampen]]. He was seriously wounded in the [[Battle of Freiberg]], where his gallantry brought him wide public notice.  Clinton distinguished himself as an [[aide-de-camp]] to Brunswick, with whom he established an enduring friendship.<ref>Willcox, p. 18</ref>  In the summer of 1762 he was promoted to colonel,<ref>Willcox, p. 19</ref> receiving the command of the [[Suffolk Regiment|12th Regiment of Foot]] in 1766.

[[Image:SirHenryClinton.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Clinton by [[John Smart]], c. 1777]]
During these early years, he formed a number of friendships and acquaintances, mostly with other officers serving in Brunswick's camp.  These included [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] and [[William Alexander (American general)|William Alexander]], who styled himself "Lord Stirling"; both of these men would face Clinton as enemies in North America.  He formed long-lasting and deep friendships with [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|John Jervis]], and [[William Phillips (British Army officer)|William Phillips]]; Phillips later served under Clinton in North America, and Jervis rose to prominence in the [[Royal Navy]].  He also made the acquaintance of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]], who would famously serve under him as well.<ref>Willcox, pp. 22<U+2013>23</ref>

===Family and marriage===
While Clinton was campaigning with the army in 1761, his father died.  As the new head of the family, he had to unwind his father's affairs, which included sizable debts as well as arrears in pay.  Battles he had with the Board of Trade over his father's unpaid salary lasted for years, and attempts to sell the land in the colonies went nowhere; these lands were confiscated during the American Revolution, and even his heirs were unable to recover any kind of compensation for them.  His mother, who had a history of mental instability and played only a small part in his life, died in August 1767.<ref>Willcox, pp. 20<U+2013>21</ref>

On 12 February 1767, Clinton married Harriet Carter, the daughter of landed gentry,<ref>Willcox, p. 25</ref>  and the couple settled into a house in [[Surrey]].  There is some evidence that the marriage was performed in haste; six months later, the household accounts contain evidence of a son, Frederick.  Frederick died of an illness in 1774, two years after his mother.  Although Clinton did not write of his marriage, it was apparently happy.  The couple produced five children: Frederick, Augusta (1768), William Henry (1769), Henry Jr. (1771), and Harriet (1772).  Clinton's wife died on 29 August 1772, eight days after giving birth to Harriet.<ref>Willcox, pp. 26<U+2013>29</ref>  It took him over a year to recover from the grief.  He took his in-laws into his house, and his wife's sisters took over the care of his children.<ref>Willcox, p. 32</ref>

===Patronage===
Upon the death of the Duke of Newcastle, his patronage was taken up by the latter's son and successor [[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 2nd Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne|Henry Pelham-Clinton]].  Although he was at times instrumental in advancing Clinton's career, the new duke's lack of attention and interest in politics would at time work against Clinton.  Clinton also complicated their relationship by treating the young duke more as an equal than as a noble who should be respected.<ref>Willcox, p. 21</ref>  A second patron was [[George III of Great Britain|King George III's]] brother [[Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh|the Duke of Gloucester]].  Clinton was appointed Gloucester's Groom of the Bedchamber in 1764, a position he continued to hold for many years.  However, some of Gloucester's indiscretions left him out of favour at court, and he was thus not an effective supporter of Clinton.<ref name=Wil22>Willcox, p. 22</ref>

===Peacetime service===
In 1769 Clinton's regiment was assigned to [[Gibraltar]], and Clinton served as second in command to [[Edward Cornwallis]].  During this time, Newcastle asked him to see after one of his (Newcastle's) sons who was serving in the garrison.  The young man, described by his father as having "''sloth'' and ''laziness''" and "''despicable behavior''",<!--italics in original--> was virtually unmanageable, and Clinton convinced the duke to put him into a French academy.<ref>Willcox, p. 28</ref>

Clinton was promoted to [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|major general]] in 1772,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=11251|startpage=2|date=23 May 1772|accessdate=24 June 2008}}</ref> and in the same year he obtained a seat in [[British Parliament|Parliament]] through Newcastle's influence.<ref>Willcox, p. 29</ref>  He remained a [[Member of Parliament]] until 1784, first for [[Boroughbridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Boroughbridge]] and subsequently for [[Newark-on-Trent (UK Parliament constituency)|Newark-on-Trent]].<ref>Willcox, pp. 29, 474</ref>  In April 1774 he went on a military inspection tour of the Russian army in the [[Balkans]].  He inspected some of the battlefields of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768<U+2013>1774)|Russo-Turkish War]] with his friend [[Henry Lloyd (soldier)|Henry Lloyd]], a general in the Russian army, and had an audience with [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in [[Vienna]].<ref>Willcox, pp. 32<U+2013>34</ref>  He very nearly had the chance to watch an artillery bombardment, but it was called off by the onset of peace negotiations.  Clinton was at one point introduced to the Turkish negotiators, of whom he wrote that "they stared a little, but were very civil."<ref>Willcox, p. 35</ref>  He returned to England in October 1774, and in February 1775 was ordered by King George to prepare for service in North America.<ref>Willcox, pp. 35<U+2013>36</ref>

==American War of Independence==
===Boston===
{{main|Battle of Bunker Hill|Siege of Boston}}
Clinton, along with Major Generals [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] and [[John Burgoyne]], were sent with reinforcements to strengthen the position of General [[Thomas Gage]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]].  They arrived on 25 May, having learned en route that the [[American War of Independence]] had broken out, and that [[Siege of Boston|Boston was under siege]].<ref>Ketchum, p. 2</ref>  Gage, along with Clinton and Generals Howe and Burgoyne discussed plans to break the siege.  Clinton was an advocate for fortifying currently unoccupied high ground surrounding Boston, and plans were laid to occupy those spots on 18 June.<ref>Ketchum, p. 46</ref>  However, the colonists learned of the plan and fortified the heights of the Charlestown peninsula on the night of 16<U+2013>17 June, forcing the British leadership to rethink their strategy.<ref>Ketchum, pp. 110<U+2013>111</ref>

[[Image:The death of general warren at the battle of bunker hill.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker Hill]]''.  Clinton is in the center background, bareheaded and holding a sword.]]
In a war council held early on 17 June, the generals developed a plan calling for a direct assault on the colonial fortification, and Gage gave Howe command of the operation.  Despite a sense of urgency (the colonists were still working on the fortifications at the time of the council), [[Battle of Bunker Hill|the attack]] did not begin until that afternoon.  Clinton was assigned the role of providing reserve forces when requested by Howe.<ref>Willcox, p. 48</ref><ref name=K164>Ketchum, p. 164</ref>  After two assaults failed, Clinton, operating against his orders from General Gage, crossed over to Charlestown to organize wounded and dispirited troops milling around the landing area.<ref name=K164/>  On the third and successful assault against the redoubt on [[Breed's Hill]], the position was taken and these troops, having rallied, arrived and drove the rebels back to Bunker Hill.<ref>Ketchum pp. 181<U+2013>182</ref>  The battle was a victory for the British, but only at the heavy cost of over 1,000 casualties.<ref>Ketchum, p. 190</ref>  Clinton famously wrote of the battle that it was "A dear bought victory, another such would have ruined us."<ref>Ketchum, p. 183</ref>

For the remainder of 1775 the siege became little more than a standoff, with the sides either unwilling or unable to mount an effective attack on the other.  After Howe took command of the forces following General Gage's recall in September, the two of them established a working relationship that started out well, but did not take long to begin breaking down.  Howe gave Clinton the command of Charlestown, but Clinton spent most of his time in Boston.  He occupied the house of [[John Hancock]], which he scrupulously cared for.<ref>Willcox, p. 59</ref>  He hired a housekeeper named Mary Baddeley, the wife of a man who had supposedly been demoted because she refused an officer's advances.  Clinton also hired Thomas Baddeley as a carpenter; the relationship Clinton established with Mary lasted the rest of his life,<ref>Willcox, p. 60</ref> although it was only platonic during his time in Boston.<ref>Willcox, p. 69</ref>

Cracks began to form in his relationship with Howe when plans were developed for an expedition to the southern colonies, command of which went to Clinton.  He asked Howe for specific officers to accompany him and authority that an independent commander might normally have, but Howe rebuffed him on all such requests.<ref>Willcox, p. 67</ref>  In January 1776, Clinton sailed south with a small fleet and 1,500 men to assess military opportunities in the Carolinas.<ref>Billias, p. 76</ref>  During his absence his fears about the situation in Boston were realized when the [[Fortification of Dorchester Heights|Dorchester Heights were occupied and fortified by the rebels]] in early March, causing the British to [[Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)|evacuate Boston]] and retreat to [[Halifax (former city), Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]].<ref>Ketchum, pp. 214<U+2013>218</ref>

===Campaigns in 1776===
{{main|Battle of Sullivan's Island|New York and New Jersey campaign}}
Clinton's expedition to the Carolinas was expected to meet a fleet sent from Europe with more troops for operations in February 1776.  Delayed by logistics and weather, this force, which included General Charles Cornwallis as Clinton's second in command and Admiral [[Sir Peter Parker, 1st Baronet|Sir Peter Parker]] did not arrive off the North Carolina coast until May.<ref>Billias, pp. 76<U+2013>77</ref>  Concluding that North Carolina was not a good base for operations, they decided to assault [[Charleston, South Carolina]], whose defenses were reported to be unfinished.  [[Battle of Sullivan's Island|Their assault]], launched in late June, was a dismal failure.  Clinton's troops were landed on an island near Sullivan's Island, where the rebel colonists had their main defenses, with the expectation that the channel between the two could be waded at low tide.  This turned out not to be the case, and the attack was reduced to a naval bombardment.<ref>Billias, p. 77</ref> The bombardment in its turn failed because the spongy [[Arecaceae|palmetto]] logs used to construct [[Fort Moultrie|the fort]] absorbed the force of the cannonballs without splintering and breaking.<ref>Russell, p. 217</ref>

[[Image:WilliamHowe1777ColorMezzotint.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|[[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] (1777 mezzotint) came to dislike Clinton during the 1776 campaign.]]
Clinton and Parker rejoined the main fleet to participate in General Howe's August 1776 assault on [[New York City]].  Clinton pestered Howe with a constant stream of ideas for the assault, which the commander in chief came to resent.<ref>Willcox, p. 104</ref>  Howe did however adopt Clinton's plan for attacking [[George Washington]]'s position in Brooklyn.  In the 27 August, [[Battle of Long Island]], British forces led by Howe and Clinton, following the latter's plan, successfully flanked the American forward positions, driving them back into their fortifications on Brooklyn Heights.<ref>Gruber (1972), pp. 111<U+2013>112</ref>  However, Howe refused Clinton's recommendation that they follow up the overwhelming victory with an assault on the entrenched Americans, due to a lack of intelligence as to their strength and a desire to minimize casualties.  Instead, Howe besieged the position, which the Americans abandoned without loss on 29 August.<ref>Willcox, p. 107</ref>  General Howe was rewarded with [[Order of the Bath|a knighthood]] for his success.<ref>Hadden, p. 375</ref>

Howe then proceeded to take control of New York City, [[landing at Kip's Bay]] on Manhattan, with Clinton again in the lead.<ref>Willcox, pp. 110<U+2013>111</ref>  Although Clinton again suggested moves to cut Washington's army off, Howe rejected them.  In October Clinton led the army ashore in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] in a bid to trap Washington between the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[Bronx River]]s.  However, Washington reached [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]] before Clinton did.<ref>Willcox, p. 113</ref>  After [[Battle of White Plains|a brief battle]] in which Washington was pushed further north, Howe turned south to consolidate control of Manhattan.  By this time the relationship between the two men had broken down almost completely, with Howe, apparently fed up with Clinton's constant stream of criticisms and suggestions, refusing to allow Clinton even minor deviations in the army's marching route.<ref>Willcox, p. 114</ref>

In November Howe ordered Clinton to begin preparing an expedition to occupy [[Newport, Rhode Island]], desired as a port by the [[Royal Navy]].  When Howe sent General Cornwallis into [[New Jersey]] to chase after Washington, Clinton proposed that, rather than taking Newport, his force should be landed in New Jersey in an attempt to envelop Washington's army.<ref>Gruber (1972), p. 135</ref>  Howe rejected this advice, and Clinton sailed for Newport in early December, occupying it in the face of minimal opposition.<ref>Willcox, pp. 123<U+2013>124</ref>

===Campaigns in 1777===
{{main|Philadelphia campaign|Saratoga campaign}}
In January 1777 Clinton was given leave to return to England.<ref>Willcox, p. 127</ref>  Planning for the 1777 campaign season called for two campaigns, one against [[Philadelphia]], and a second that would descend from [[Montreal]] on [[Lake Champlain]] to [[Albany, New York]], separating the [[New England]] colonies.  Since General Howe was taking leadership of the [[Philadelphia campaign]], Clinton contested for command of the northern campaign with Burgoyne.  Howe supported him this effort, but Burgoyne convinced King George and [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville|Lord Germain]] to give him the command.<ref>Mintz, pp. 113<U+2013>115</ref>  The king refused Clinton's request to resign, and ordered him back to New York to serve again as Howe's second in command.  He was placated with a knighthood, but was also forbidden to publish accounts of the disastrous Charleston affair.<ref>Willcox, p. 137</ref>  He was formally invested in the [[Order of the Bath]] on 11 April, and sailed for New York on the 29th.<ref>Willcox, p. 141</ref>

When Clinton arrived in New York in July, Howe had not yet sailed for Philadelphia.<ref>Willcox, p. 153</ref>  Clinton was surprised and upset that he would be left to hold New York with 7,000 troops, dominated by Loyalist formations and [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]], an arrangement he saw as inadequate to the task.  He also quite bluntly informed Howe of the defects he saw in Howe's plan, which would isolate Burgoyne from any reasonable chance of support by either Howe or Clinton.<ref>Willcox, p. 154</ref>  He presciently wrote after learning that much of Washington's force had left the New York area, "I fear it bears heavy on Burgoyne ... If this campaign does not finish the war, I prophesy that there is an end of British dominion in America."<ref>Willcox, p. 157</ref>

[[Saratoga campaign|Burgoyne's campaign]] ended in disaster; Burgoyne was [[Battles of Saratoga|stopped at Saratoga]] and surrendered shortly after.<ref>Mintz, pp. 221<U+2013>223</ref>  Clinton attempted to support Burgoyne, but the delay in arrival of reinforcements put off the effort.  In early October, Clinton [[Battle of Forts Clinton and Montgomery|captured two forts]] in the Hudson River highlands, and sent troops up the river toward Albany.<ref>Mintz, pp. 203<U+2013>205</ref>  The effort was too little and too late, and was cut off when he received orders from Howe requesting reinforcements.  Howe's campaign for Philadelphia had been a success, but he had very nearly suffered a defeat in the [[Battle of Germantown]].

As the commander in New York, Clinton was obligated to do a certain amount of entertaining.  This he did, although he chafed at the costs involved.  He was eventually joined by the Baddeleys.  Mary Baddeley resumed her role as housekeeper, which he appreciated in part because of her excellent managerial skills.<ref>Willcox, pp. 171<U+2013>172</ref>  She apparently rebuffed Clinton's romantic overtures until she discovered her husband had been cheating on her.  Clinton procured a position in one of the Loyalist regiments for her husband, and tried without success to get him transferred out of New York.<ref>Willcox, p. 199</ref>

===Commander in Chief===
General Howe submitted his resignation as [[Commander-in-Chief, North America|Commander-in-Chief for North America]] in the wake of the 1777 campaigns, and Clinton was on the short list of nominees to replace him.  Despite being mistrusted by Prime Minister [[Frederick North, Lord North|North]], principally over his many complaints and requests to resign, Clinton was formally appointed to the post on 4 February 1778.  Word of this did not arrive until April, and Clinton assumed command in Philadelphia in May 1778.<ref>Billias, pp. 61,82</ref>  France had by this time [[France in the American Revolutionary War|formally entered the war]] on the American side.  Clinton was consequently ordered to withdraw from Philadelphia and send 5,000 of his troops to the economically important Caribbean.  For the rest of the war, Clinton received few reinforcements as a consequence of the globalisation of the conflict.<ref>Billias, p. 83</ref>  His orders were to strengthen areas of North America that were firmly under British control, and do no more than conduct raiding expeditions in the rebel-controlled areas.<ref>Willcox, pp. 222<U+2013>223</ref>

Owing to a shortage of transports for all of the Loyalists fleeing Philadelphia, Clinton acted against his direct orders and decided to move the army to New York by land instead of by sea.<ref>Willcox, p. 227</ref>  He conducted a skillful march to New York, accomplished without losing a wagon, and fighting a standoff battle with Washington's army at [[Battle of Monmouth|Monmouth Court House]] on 28 June.<ref>Willcox, pp. 233<U+2013>237</ref>  Clinton burnished his reputation at home by penning a report on the movement that greatly exaggerated the size of Washington's army and minimised the British casualties at Monmouth.<ref>Leckie, p. 401</ref>  Arriving in New York, he and Admiral Howe were faced with the spectre of a French fleet outside the harbour.  Fortunately, Admiral [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|d'Estaing]] decided against crossing the bar into the harbour, and sailed instead for Newport.<ref>Willcox, pp. 238<U+2013>239</ref>  Once Clinton learned of his destination he marshalled troops to reinforce the Newport garrison while Lord Howe sailed to meet d'Estaing.  Both fleets were scattered by a storm, and [[Battle of Rhode Island|the American attempt]] on Newport failed before Clinton arrived.<ref>Willcox, pp. 242<U+2013>250</ref>  Clinton sent the supporting force on [[Grey's raid|a raid]] of nearby communities, while he returned to New York to organize the troops that were to be sent southward.<ref>Willcox, p. 251</ref>  The detachment to strengthen the Floridas was sent to instead strike at [[Georgia (U. S. state)|Georgia]].  This force [[Capture of Savannah|took]] [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] in December, and in January 1779 it gained a tenuous (and ultimately temporary) foothold at [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]].<ref>Wilson, pp. 70<U+2013>101</ref>  He also detached troops for service in the [[West Indies]], pursuant to a plan to capture [[St. Lucia]]; [[Battle of St. Lucia|the expedition]] was a success, compelling a French surrender not long before the French fleet arrived.<ref>Willcox, p. 254</ref>

During his time in Philadelphia and New York in 1778 Clinton managed to establish a harmonious relationship with [[William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland|William Eden]], a member of the [[Carlisle Peace Commission]].  This commission, nominally led by the [[Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle|Earl of Carlisle]] had been sent in a vain attempt at reconciliation with the rebel Congress.  Despite its failures, Eden and Clinton got along, and Eden promised to make sure Clinton's dispatches received favourable distribution in England.<ref>Willcox, pp. 254<U+2013>255</ref>

===Politics===
[[Image:Sir henry clinton.jpg|left|thumb|General Sir Henry Clinton K.B. Commander-in-Chief of British troops in America. Published between 1770 and 1780.]]
With the 1778 campaign season closed, Clinton considered options for action in 1779.  Although he felt that Britain would be best served by withdrawing to the frontiers, popular opinion at home, as well as that of the king and Lord Germain, dictated otherwise.  Germain felt that raiding expeditions should be conducted "with spirit and humanity" to destroy American commerce and privateering;<ref>Willcox, pp. 256<U+2013>257</ref> this strategy was one Clinton disliked.<ref>Willcox, p. 277</ref> Militarily, Clinton and Washington did little more than stare at each other across the lines of New York City.  Clinton ordered two major raiding expeditions, one [[Tryon's raid|against Connecticut]], the other [[Chesapeake raid|against Chesapeake Bay]],<!--Willcox pp 274-277--> while Washington detached troops to deal with the increasing frontier war, which was primarily orchestrated from [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Quebec]].<!--{fact-->

Early in 1779 Clinton sent his trusted aide, Lieutenant Duncan Drummond, to England in order to argue Clinton's request to be recalled.  Drummond was unsuccessful in this: despite the intervention of the Duke of Newcastle, the king refused to even consider granting Clinton leave, claiming that Clinton was "the only man who might still save America".<ref>Willcox, p. 263</ref>  William Eden also interceded in an attempt to improve Clinton's situation, but political divisions in the government and the prospect of Spanish entry into the war meant that Clinton ended up with very little support.<ref>Willcox, pp. 264<U+2013>266</ref>  Clinton also complained about the lack of naval support being provided by Admiral [[James Gambier (Royal Navy officer)|James Gambier]], with whom he also had a difficult relationship.  He eventually sent London a list of admirals he thought he could work with; none of them were chosen, and Gambier was replaced temporarily by [[George Collier]] before his permanent replacement, [[Mariot Arbuthnot]], arrived.<ref>Willcox, pp. 273<U+2013>274</ref>

After the Chesapeake raid Clinton drove the Americans from a key crossing of the Hudson River at [[Stony Point, New York]].  Clinton had hoped that, with an expected reinforcement of troops from Europe, he could then attack either Washington's army or its supply lines, forcing Washington out of his well-defended mountain positions.<ref>Johnston, pp. 43<U+2013>44</ref>   However, the reinforcements, including Admiral Arbuthnot, were late in arriving, and Stony Point was [[Battle of Stony Point|retaken]] by the Americans after Clinton weakened its garrison to supply men for the Connecticut raids.  The Americans chose not to hold Stony Point, and Clinton reoccupied it.   However, Clinton's opponents used the American success to criticise him, calling him "undetermined" and "feeble".<ref>Willcox, p. 278</ref>  [[Battle of Paulus Hook|A similar action]] against a British outpost in New Jersey gave them further ammunition, and soured British morale.<ref>Willcox, p. 279</ref>  Further actions from New York were rendered impossible by the need for the naval squadron to address the [[Penobscot Expedition|American expedition]] to dislodge a newly established British outpost in [[Penobscot Bay]].<ref>Willcox, p. 281</ref>

On 30 June 1779 Clinton issued what has become known as the [[Philipsburg Proclamation]] (so named because it was issued from his headquarters at the [[Philipsburg Manor House]] in [[Westchester County, New York]]).  This proclamation institutionalized in the British Army an offer of freedom to enlisted [[runaway slaves]] that had first been made in [[Lord Dunmore's Proclamation|a similar proclamation]] by Virginia Governor [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]] in 1775.  He justified this offer by citing the fact that the Continental Army was also actively recruiting [[African Americans]].  The proclamation led to a flood of fugitive slaves making their way to British lines to take advantage of the offer,<ref>Lanning, p. 134</ref> and the issue of slave repatriation would complicate Anglo-American relations as the war was ending.<ref>Lanning, p. 158</ref>

===Southern strategy===
Clinton's relationship with Arbuthnot got off to a bad start.  Rumors of a French fleet headed for northern ports (Halifax, Newport, or New York) pulled the leaders in different directions, and put off plans to withdraw from Newport for the purposes of strengthening the New York garrison (which had been weakened by disease) on at least one occasion.<ref>Willcox, pp. 289<U+2013>293</ref>  However, the French instead [[Siege of Savannah|besieged Savannah, Georgia]] with American assistance, and failed disastrously in the attempt.  This convinced Clinton that an expedition against South Carolina held promise; Loyalist support was said to be strong there, and the people were said to be "sick of their opposition to government" and the British blockade of their ports.<ref>Willcox, pp. 293<U+2013>294</ref>

Clinton began to assemble a force an expedition to take Charleston, withdrawing the forces from Newport for the purpose.  Clinton took personal command of this campaign, and the task force with 14,000 men sailed south from New York at the end of the year.  By early 1780, Clinton had brought [[Siege of Charleston|Charleston under siege]].  In May, working together with Admiral Arbuthnot, he forced the surrender of the city, with its garrison of 5,000, in a stunning and serious defeat for the rebel cause. Arbuthnot and Clinton did not work together well during the siege, and their feuding lasted into 1781, with disastrous results for the unity of the British high command.<ref>Harvey</ref><ref>Wyatt, pp. 3<U+2013>26. Wyatt argues that Clinton had mild neurosis and was unable to work with those whom he considered equal.</ref>  Clinton's relationship with Cornwallis also deteriorated further during the siege, improving slightly after the American surrender and Clinton's departure for New York.<ref>Borick, pp. 235<U+2013>236</ref>

From New York, he oversaw the campaign in the South, and his correspondence to Cornwallis through the war showed an active interest in the affairs of his southern army.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=3&CATID=10743 Cornwallis Papers], [[The National Archives]]. Retrieved 30 September 2008.</ref> However, as the campaign progressed, he grew further and further away from his subordinate. As the campaign drew to a close, the correspondence became more and more acrimonious. Part of this may be due to George Germain, whose correspondence with Cornwallis may have convinced the junior officer to start disregarding the orders of his superior and consider himself to be an independent command.<ref>Germain Papers, Clements Library, An Arbor. [http://www.clements.umich.edu/Webguides/Arlenes/G/Germain.html Germain Papers]. Retrieved 30 September 2008.</ref>

In 1782, after fighting in the North American theater ended with the [[Siege of Yorktown|surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown]], Clinton was replaced as Commander-in-Chief by Sir [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]], and he returned to England.

==Later career==
In 1783, he published a ''Narrative of the Campaign of 1781 in North America'' in which he attempted to lay the blame for the 1781 campaign failures on General Cornwallis.  This was met with a public response by Cornwallis, who leveled his own criticisms at Clinton.  Clinton also resumed his seat in Parliament, serving until 1784.<ref name="NNDB">[http://www.nndb.com/people/061/000049911/ Sir Henry Clinton]. [[Notable Names Database]]. Retrieved 23 September 2008.</ref>

Not much is known about what Sir Henry did from 1784 until he was re-elected to Parliament in 1790 for [[Launceston (UK Parliament constituency)|Launceston]], a [[pocket borough]] controlled by his cousin Newcastle. Three years later, in October 1793, Clinton was promoted to full general. The following July he was appointed [[Governor of Gibraltar]], but he died at [[Portland Place]] before he was able to assume that post.<ref name="ODNB">{{cite web|first=Ira D|last=Gruber|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: Clinton, Sir Henry (1730<U+2013>1795)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5681|accessdate=16 September 2008}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Sir Henry Clinton held the command in America for four years, ending in disaster and defeat.<ref name="Mackesy p. 213"/>  As a result, he was widely seen to share in the blame for the defeat.  Biographer William Willcox, in his analysis of Clinton's tenure in North America, observes that at times "Sir Henry's ideas were not carried out for reasons that lay to some extent within himself",<ref>Willcox, p. 498</ref> and that he and Admiral Graves "apparently ignored the danger" of de Grasse in 1781.<ref>Willcox, p. 497</ref>  However, Willcox notes that campaign plans Clinton formulated for 1777, 1779 and 1780 were frustrated by external events he could not control, and Willcox generally blames Cornwallis for the failure of the Carolina campaign.<ref>Willcox, p. 493</ref>  (In contrast, Cornwallis biographers Franklin and Mary Wickwire point out that Cornwallis' failures are at least partially attributable to directives of Clinton that left him with relatively inadequate troop strength and irregular supply lines.)<ref>Wickwire, pp. 135<U+2013>137</ref>

Major James Wemyss, who served under Clinton, wrote that he was "an honourable and respectable officer of the German school; having served under Prince Ferdinand of Prussia and the Duke of Brunswick. Vain, open to flattery; and from a great aversion to all business not military, too often misled by aides and favourites", but also pointed out that Clinton's interests were narrow and that he was crippled by self-distrust.<ref name="Mackesy p. 213"/> Colonel [[Charles Stuart (British army officer)|Sir Charles Stuart]] described him as "fool enough to command an army when he is incapable of commanding a troop of horse." Historian [[Piers Mackesy]] writes that he was "a very capable general in the field."<ref name="Mackesy p. 213">Mackesy, p. 213</ref>

Letters from General Sir Henry Clinton during the Revolutionary War can be found in the political papers of his cousin, [[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 2nd Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne|Henry Pelham-Clinton]], in the Newcastle (Clumber) Collection held at [[Manuscripts and Special Collections, The University of Nottingham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/manuscriptsandspecialcollections/learning/biographies/sirhenryclinton%281730-1795%29.aspx|title=Sir Henry Clinton|publisher=University of Nottingham|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref>
