'''Sardinia''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|s|<U+0251>r|<U+02C8>|d|<U+026A>|n|i|<U+0259>}}, {{lang-it|Sardegna}} {{IPA-it|sar<U+02C8>de<U+0272><U+0272>a|}}, {{lang-sc|Sardigna}} {{IPA-itdia|sar<U+02C8>dinja|}}) is the [[Mediterranean islands#By area|second-largest]] island in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (after [[Sicily]] and before [[Cyprus]]). It is an [[Regions of Italy|autonomous region]] of [[Italy]], and the nearest land masses are (clockwise from north) the [[France|French]] island of [[Corsica]], the [[Italian Peninsula]], [[Sicily]], [[Tunisia]] and the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Balearic Islands]].

The name Sardinia is from the pre-Roman noun *sard[], [[Romanization|romanised]] as '''sardus''' (feminine '''sarda'''); that the name had a religious connotation is suggested from its use also as the adjective for the ancient Sardinian mythological hero-god [[Sardus|Sardus Pater]] "Sardinian Father" (misunderstood by many modern Sardinians/Italians as being "Father Sardus"), as well as being the stem of the adjective "[[Sardonicism|sardonic]]". Sardinia was called ''Ichnusa'' (the Latinised form of the Greek ''Hyknousa''), ''Sandalion'', ''Sardinia'' and ''Sardo'' by the ancient Greeks and the Romans.

[[File:Sardegna.svg|190px|thumb|left|Terrain map of Sardinia]]

Sardinia is  the second largest island in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], with an area of 23,821&nbsp;km<U+00B2>. It is situated between 38<U+00B0> 51' and 41<U+00B0> 15' latitude north and 8<U+00B0> 8' and 9<U+00B0> 50' east longitude. To the west of Sardinia is the [[Balearic Sea]], a unit of the Mediterranean Sea; to Sardinia's east is the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], which is also an element of the Mediterranean Sea.<ref>C.Michael Hogan. 2011. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Balearic_Sea?topic=49523 ''Balearic Sea''. Encyclopedia of Earth. Eds. P.Saundry & C.J.Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC]</ref>

The coasts of Sardinia (1,849&nbsp;km long) are generally high and rocky, with long, relatively straight stretches of coastline, many outstanding headlands, a few wide, deep bays, [[ria]]s,  many inlets and with various smaller islands off the coast.

The island has an ancient geoformation and, unlike Sicily and the mainland of Italy, is not earthquake-prone. Its rocks date from the [[Palaeozoic Era]] (up to 500 million years old). Due to long erosion processes the island's highlands, formed of granite, schist, trachyte, basalt (called "jaras" or "gollei"), sandstone and dolomite limestone (called ''tonneri'' or "heels"), average at between 300 to 1,000 metres.  The highest peak is [[Punta La Marmora]] (1,834 m), part of the [[Gennargentu]] Ranges in the centre of the island. Other mountain chains are [[Monte Limbara]] (1,362 m) in the northeast, the [[Monte Rasu|Chain of Marghine and Goceano]] (1,259 m) running crosswise for {{convert|40|km|2|abbr=on}} towards the north, the [[Monte Albo]] (1057 metres), the Sette Fratelli Range in the southeast, and the [[Sulcis Mountains]] and the Monte Linas (1236 metres) in the southwest and in Oristano (Monte Arci, 1.700 m). The island's ranges and plateaux are separated by wide alluvial valleys and flatlands, the main ones being the [[Campidano]] in the southwest between [[Oristano]] and [[Cagliari]] and the [[Nurra]] in the northwest.
[[File:Altimetria Sardegna.svg|thumb|A proportionate graph of Sardinian topography: 13.6% of the island is mountainous, 18.5% is flat, and 67.9% is hilly.]]

Sardinia has few major rivers, the largest being the [[Tirso (river)|Tirso]], {{convert|151|km|2|abbr=on}} long, which flows into the [[Sea of Sardinia]], the [[Coghinas]] (115&nbsp;km) and the [[Flumendosa]] (127&nbsp;km). There are 54 [[artificial lakes]] and dams which supply water and electricity. The main ones are [[Lake Omodeo]] and [[Lake Coghinas]]. The only natural freshwater lake is [[Lago di Baratz]]. A number of large, shallow, salt-water lagoons and pools are located along the {{convert|1850|km|2|abbr=on}} of the coastline.

The island has a typical [[Mediterranean climate]]. During the year there are approximately 300 days of sunshine, with a major concentration of rainfall in the winter and autumn, some heavy showers in the spring and snowfalls in the highlands. The average temperature is between {{convert|11|to|17|C|F|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://www.paradisola.it/varie/clima.asp IL CLIMA DELLA SARDEGNA - Raimondi et al., 1995]</ref>
The [[Mistral (wind)|Mistral]] from the northwest is the dominant wind on and off throughout the year, though it is most prevalent in winter and spring. It can blow quite strongly, but it is usually dry and cool and makes for a sailor's paradise.

=== Prehistory ===

Sardinia is one of the most geologically ancient bodies of land in [[Europe]]. Though evidence of human visits date from the [[Palaeolithic]] period, permanent settlements only appear much later in the [[Neolithic]] age, around 6000 BC.

[[image:Sa ena e thomes 2.jpg|thumb|left|'' [[Giants' grave]] in [[Dorgali]]]]

The first people to settle in northern Sardinia probably came from the Italian mainland via Corsica, particularly from [[Etruria]] (present-day Tuscany), while those who populated the central region of the island around the salt lakes of Cabras and St Giusta may have arrived from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by way of the [[Balearic Islands]]. The settlements founded around the [[Gulf of Cagliari]] seem to be of various origins.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charmingsardinia.com/booksardegna/SARDINIA-Cagliari-Villasimius-Costa%20Rei-Oristano-2009.pdf  |title= History & Travel Guide of South Sardinia }}</ref>

Evidence of trade with [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] (Eastern Mediterranean) centres is present in the period 1600 BC onwards; for example fine ceramic products from [[Kydonia|Cydonia]] have been recovered in Sardinia. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} As time passed, the different Sardinian peoples appear to have became united in language {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and customs, yet remained divided politically as various small, tribal groupings, at times banding together, and at others waging war against each other. Habitations consisted of round thatched stone huts, similar to those of present-day shepherds.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

[[File:Nuraghe Losa.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Nuraghe]] [[Losa]]]]

From about 1500 BC onwards, villages were built around the round tower-fortresses called ''[[nuraghi]]'' (Northern Sardinian ''nuraghes'', Southern Sardinian ''nuraxis'', plurals of ''[[nuraghe]]'' and ''nuraxi'' respectively), which were often reinforced and enlarged with battlements. The boundaries of tribal territories were guarded by smaller lookout ''nuraghi'' erected on strategic hills commanding a view of other territories. Today some 7,000 nuraghi dot the Sardinian landscape. According to some scholars the nuragic peoples are identifiable with the [[Shardana]], a tribe of the "[[Sea Peoples]]".<ref>[http://www.sardiniapoint.it/5085.html SardiniaPoint.it - Interview with Giovanni Ugas , archaeologist and professor of the University of Cagliari {{it}}]</ref>

=== Ancient history ===

Circa 1000 BC the [[Phoenicia]]ns began visiting Sardinia with increasing frequency, presumably initially needing safe over-night and/or all-weather anchorages along their trade routes from the coast of modern-day Lebanon as far afield as the African and European Atlantic coasts and beyond, including Britain {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. The most common ports of call were [[Caralis]], [[Nora, Italy|Nora]], [[Bithia]], [[Sulcis]], [[Tharros]], [[Bosa]] and [[Olbia]]. These soon became important colonies, inhabited by [[Phoenicia]]n traders and their families who traded overseas and with the Sardinians {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.

[[File:Colonne a tharros.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Phoenician and Roman town of [[Tharros]]]]

In 509 BC, as Phoenicians expanded along the coastal cities, the Sardinians attacked them.  The Phoenicians then called upon their fellow Phoenicians in [[Carthage]] for help. For 271 years, the Carthaginian or Punic civilizations flourished alongside each other.

In 238 BC the Carthaginians, as a result of their defeat by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in the first [[Punic War]], surrendered Sardinia to Rome. Sardinia became a Roman province, and the existing coastal cities were enlarged and embellished, while [[Colonia (Roman)|Coloniae]] such as [[Porto Torres|Turris Lybissonis]] and [[Posada, Sardinia|Feronia]] were founded. These were populated by Roman immigrants. The Roman military occupation brought the Nuragic civilization to an end. Roman domination of Sardinia lasted 694 years. Sardinia provided grain to the city of Rome. However, it was often opposed by the Sardinians in the mountainous regions, even though even here the Latin language came to dominate, though not Latin civilization.

=== Vandal interlude===

The [[Vandals]] led by King [[Geiseric]] had migrated to coastal [[Numidia]] (modern Morocco and Algeria) from Spain in AD 429 at the invitation of the Roman governor of North Africa [[Bonifacius|Count Boniface]].  The Vandals were seeking safe haven from military pressure by the Romans from [[Gaul]] (modern France, Belgium and North Italy).  Boniface was seeking to shore up his military position in the succession struggle following the death of Western Emperor [[Honorius]].  In AD 439, the [[Vandals]] revolted and seized Carthage and [[Africa Proconsularis|Africa]] (modern Tunisa, and Libya).  The new [[Vandals|Vandal Kingdom of North Africa]] achieved peace with the Romans on favorable terms in AD 442, but in AD 455 another Roman coup d'<U+00E9>tat killed Emperor [[Valentinian III]] whose daughter had been promised to Geiseric's son.   Geiseric, led his powerful fleet to [[Sack of Rome (455)|sack Rome]], along the way occupying [[Caralis]] and other key coastal cities of Sardinia and claiming the island for his kingdom.

Vandal rule lasted for 77 or 88 years of which there is little detail in the historical record. It is known that the Vandal government continued the forms of the existing Roman Imperial structure. The governor of Sardinia continued to be called the ''[[praeses]]'' and apparently continued to manage military, judicial, and civil governmental functions via imperial procedures. (This continuity was not novel to Sardinia; like the Visigoths, the Vandals generally maintained the pretense of the empire, nominally acknowledging [[Constantinople]] and declaring themselves its deputies.)  The only Vandal governor of Sardinia about whom there is substantial record is the last, [[Goddas]], a [[Visigoth]] noble.  In AD 530 a coup d'<U+00E9>tat in Carthage removed King [[Hilderic]], a convert to [[Roman Catholicism]], in favor of his cousin [[Gelimer]], an [[Arian]] Christian like most of his kingdom.  Goddas was sent to take charge and ensure the loyalty of Roman Catholic Sardinia.  He did the exact opposite, declaring the island's independence from Carthage and opening negotiations with Emperor [[Justinian I]], who had declared war on Hilderic's behalf.  In AD 533 Gelimer sent the bulk of his army to Sardinia to subdue Goddas, with the catastrophic result that the Vandal Kingdom was overwhelmed when Justinian's own army under [[Belisarius]] arrived in their absence.  The Vandal Kingdom conquered, Sardinia was returned to Byzantine rule.<ref>The Vandals by Andy Merrills and Richard Miles, published by John Wiley & Sons, 2010, p. 136.

=== Byzantine Period ===

In AD 533 Sardinia returned to the rule of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] or the [[Byzantine Empire]] when the Vandals were defeated by the armies of [[Justinian I]] under the General [[Belisarius]] in the [[Battle of Tricamarum]]. This Roman victory over the Vandals in North Africa returned Sardinia to the Roman fold for the next 300 years.<ref>[http://www.provinciadelsole.it/eng/bizantina.html Province of Cagliari,Province of the Sun]</ref>
[[File:Justinian mosaik ravenna.jpg<U+200E>|thumb|right|380px|[[Justinian I]]'s Imperial Court Mosaic. Note: Justinian is center and [[Belisarius]] is likely the first man on the left.]]

Under Byzantine rule, the island was divided into districts called ''mer<U+00E8>ie'', which were governed by a judge residing in Caralis ([[Cagliari]]) and garrisoned by an army stationed in Forum Traiani today known as [[Fordongianus]] under the command of a ''dux''. The Byzantines practiced [[Christianity]] and converted the largely [[pagan]] population of early medieval Sardinia.  Along with lay Christianity, the followers of monastic figures such as [[St. Basil]] became established in Sardinia. While Christianity penetrated the majority of the population, the region of [[Barbagia]] remained largely pagan. In Barbagia towards the end of the 6th century, a short-lived independent principality established itself, returning to the local traditional religions. One of its Princes, the last pagan Prince, was Ospitone, who conducted raids upon the neighboring Christian communities controlled by the Byzantine Dux Zabarda. He was later reprimanded by [[Pope Gregory I]] within a letter for ''"Dum enim Barbaricini omnes ut insensata animalia vivant, deum verum nesciant, ligna autem et lapides adorent''(living, all like irrational animals, ignorant of the true God and worshiping wood and stone)."<ref>Sardinia and the Sardes by Charles Edwardes, ''R. Bentley and Son, London'', 1889, p. 249.</ref> In AD 594. Ospitone was then convinced by Gregory the Great, and likely the circumstances of  his conflict with Zabarda, to convert to Christianity after receiving the papal letter. His followers, however, were not immediately convinced and ostracized their prince for a short time before they themselves converted.<ref>Sardinia and the Sardes by Charles Edwardes, ''R. Bentley and Son, London'', 1889, p. 248.</ref>

Exactly when and how Byzantine rule ended in Sardinia is not known.  Direct central control was maintained at least through circa AD 650, after which local legates were empowered in the face of the rebellion of [[Gregory the Patrician]], [[Exarchate of Africa|Exarch of Africa]] and the First Invasion of the [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa]].  There is some evidence that senior Byzantine administration in the [[Exarchate of Africa]] retreated to Cagliari following the final fall of [[Carthage]] to the Arabs in AD 697.<ref name="P. Grierson 1998, p. 287">P. Grierson & L.Travaini, Medieval European Coinage, Cambridge University Press, 1998, p. 287.</ref>  The loss of imperial control in Africa led to escalating [[Moorish]] and [[Berber people|Berber]] raids on the island, the first of which is document in AD 705, forcing increased military self-reliance in the province.<ref>Salvatore Consentino, Byzantine Sardinia between East and West, ''Millennium'' <U+2013> Berlin, New York (2004) Pages 329<U+2013>367</ref> Communication with the central government became daunting if not impossible during and after the [[Muslim conquest of Sicily]] of AD 827 and AD 902.  A letter by Pope Nicholas I as early as 864 mentions the "Sardinian judges," without reference to the empire and a letter by Pope John VIII (reigned AD 872 <U+2013> AD 882) refers to them as principes ("princes").  By the time of <U+2018><U+2019>[[De Administrando Imperio]]<U+2019><U+2019>, completed in 952, the Byzantine authorities no longer listed Sardinia as an imperial province, suggesting they considered it lost.<ref name="P. Grierson 1998, p. 287"/>

Whether this final transformation from imperial civil servant to independent sovereign resulted from imperial abandonment or local assertion, by the tenth century, the <U+2018><U+2019>[[Giudici]]<U+2019><U+2019> (Latin ''iudiices'', literally meaning "judges," a Byzantine administrative title) )had emerged as the autonomous rulers of Sardinia. The title of ''iudice'' changed with the language and local understanding of the position, becoming the Sardinian ''giudice'', essentially ''sovereign'', while ''[[Giudicati|giudicato]]'', literally judgeship, came to mean both "state" and "palace" or "capital."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.provinciadelsole.it/eng/bizantina.html |title=provinciadelsole.it |publisher=provinciadelsole.it |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>

=== Medieval history ===

The new political system that followed the ''de facto'' end of Byzantine showed a significant inheritance from the millennium of imperial structure.  The Sardinians called their leaders ''[[Giudicati|Giudici]]'', derived from the Byzantine magistrate title of ''iuidici'' (''judici'', literally <U+201C>judge,<U+201D> or <U+201C>magistrate<U+201D>), though they were the equivalent of the equally new sovereign titles <U+201C>duke,<U+201D> and <U+201C>king.<U+201D>  Although the ''Giudicati'' were hereditary lordships, the old Roman/Byzantine imperial notion that separated personal title or honor from the state still obtained, so the ''Giudicato'' (<U+201C>judgeship,<U+201D> essentially, a kingdom) was not regarded as the personal property of the monarch as was common in later European [[feudalism]].  Like the imperial systems, the new order also preserved Republican forms, with national assemblies called ''corona de logu,'' although its powers and importance are not well understood by historians.  Each ''Giudicato'' saw to its own defense, maintained its own laws and administration, and looked after its own foreign and trading affairs.<ref>Birocchi, I. and Mattone A. ''La carta de logu d'Arborea nella storia del diritto medievale e moderno''. Laterza: 2004.</ref>

In the 10th century there were five known ''Giudicati'' on Sardinia, but, the annexation of the [[Giudicato of Agugliastra]] by the [[Giudicato of Cagliari]] sometime in the 10th or 11th century stabilized the number at four, where it would remain until the Aragonese invasion of the 14th century.  The history of the four ''Giudicati'' would be defined by the contest for influence between the rival rising sea powers of [[Genoa]] and [[Pisa]], and later the ambitions of the [[Kingdom of Aragon]].

[[File:Eleanor statue Oristano.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of ''Giudicessa'' [[Eleanor of Arborea]] in [[Oristano]]]]

The [[Giudicato of Cagliari]] was allied to the [[Republic of Genoa]]. It was brought to an end in 1258 when its capital, St Igia, was stormed and destroyed by an alliance of Sardinian and Pisan forces. The territory then briefly became a colony of [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]].

The [[Giudicato of Logudoro]] (sometimes called Torres) was also allied to the [[Republic of Genoa]] and came to an end in 1259 on the death of the ''judikessa'' (queen) [[Adelasia of Torres|Adelasia]]. The territory was divided up between the [[Doria]] family of [[Genoa]] and the Basserra family of [[Giudicato of Arborea|Arborea]], while the city of [[Sassari]] became an autonomous [[Medieval commune|city-republic]].

The [[Giudicato of Gallura]] ended in the year 1288, when the last ''giudice'', [[Nino Visconti]] (a friend of [[Dante Alighieri]]), was driven out by the [[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]]s, who occupied the territory.

The [[Giudicato of Arborea]] had a longer life compared to the other kingdoms. It lasted some 520 years and had [[Oristano]] ({{lang-sc|Aristanis}}) as its capital. The kingdom was called Arborea after its coat of arms, which featured a green uprooted tree on a white field. The history of Arborea is entwined with the history of the Sardinian struggle for independence against [[Aragon]]ese invasion.

The first king of Arborea to actively pursue the plan to unite Sardinia under the rule of Arborea was Barisone the First. He managed to be crowned King of Sardinia by the [[Holy Roman Empire]] Emperor Frederick "Barbarossa" the First in 1164. However, in order to obtain the title of King of Sardinia, Barisone the First had taken out a loan from the [[Republic of Genoa]] that he was unable to pay back. For this reason, he was imprisoned by the Republic of Genoa and was detained for 7 years. Barisone never succeeded in uniting Sardinia under his rule because of his financial problems.

In 1297, Pope [[Boniface VIII]] established on his own initiative (''motu proprio'') a hypothetical ''regnum Sardiniae et Corsicae'' ("[[Kingdom of Sardinia|Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica]]") in order to settle the [[War of the Vespers]] diplomatically. This had broken out in 1282 between the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] and [[Aragonese people|Aragonese]] over the possession of Sicily. The Pope offered this newly created crown to James II, the [[King of Aragon]], promising him support should he wish to conquer Pisan Sardinia in exchange for Sicily.

In 1323 the king of Arborea formed an alliance with James II of Aragon against the Pisans, despite being aware of the Aragonese plans to take control of Sardinia, because they saw the Pisans as a bigger threat. It is also important to remember that the kings of Arborea descended in part from an Aragonese family. The Aragonese flag appeared on the Arborean coat of arms and flags along with the uprooted tree until the later conflict between Arborea and Aragon escalated.  Following a military campaign which lasted a year or so, the Aragonese occupied the Pisan territories of Cagliari and Gallura along with the city of Sassari, naming them "The Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica". However, soon the king of Arborea started to wage war against the Aragonese, having his own plans to unite Sardinia as one independent kingdom.

When the other Giudicati had been taken over by foreign powers, the kings of Arborea started to see themselves as the legitimate defenders of Sardinian rule and Sardinian interests. They not only waged war against the Kings of Aragon, who were trying to conquer all of Sardinia, they also formalised the legal and political institutions that were the basis of their statehood and independence, such as by promulgating the legal code of the kingdom in the [[Carta de Logu]] ({{lang-en|Charter of the Land}}). The Carta de Logu was originally compiled by [[Mariano IV of Arborea]], and was amended and updated by Mariano's daughter, Queen [[Eleanor of Arborea]]. The legal code was written in Sardinian and established a whole range of citizens' rights. Among the revolutionary concepts in this Carta de Logu was the right of women to refuse marriage and to own property. In terms of civil liberties, the code made provincial 14th century Sardinia one of the most developed societies in all of Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://traveler.nationalgeographic.com/2009/09/drives/italy-emerald-coast-text |title=Sardinia, Italy, Drive - National Geographic Traveler |publisher=Traveler.nationalgeographic.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref>

In the Carta de Logu it is clear that the kings and queens of Arborea saw themselves as the legitimate rulers of Sardinia: they stated very clearly that the Carta de Logu applied to the whole of Sardinia, not just to their dominions, and that it had been established to guarantee the well-being and development of the Sardinian state and its people.

In 1353 [[Peter IV of Aragon]], following Aragonese custom, granted a parliament to the kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica, which was followed in due course by some degree of self-government under a viceroy and judicial independence. This parliament, however, had some very limited powers. It consisted of high-ranking military commanders, the clergy and the nobility. The kingdom of Aragon also introduced the [[feudal]] system into the areas of Sardinia ruled by it.

The Sardinian kingdoms never adopted feudalism, and the Kingdom of Arborea maintained its parliament called the "Corona de Logu". In this parliament, apart from the nobles and military commanders, also sat the representatives of each township and village. The Corona de Logu exercised some control over the king: under the rule of the "bannus consensus" the king could be deposed or even killed if he did not follow the rules of the kingdom.

From 1365 to 1409 the Arborean ''giudici'' Mariano IV, Ugone III, Mariano V (assisted by his mother Eleonora, the famous ''giudicessa'' regent), and Guglielmo III (the French grandson of Eleonora) succeeded in occupying all of Sardinia except the heavily fortified towns of the Castle of Cagliari (today simply Cagliari) and [[Alghero]], which for years were the only Aragonese dominions in Sardinia. The Giudicato of Arborea and its monarchs received a great deal of support from many Sardinians of all classes, partly because many Sardinians were strongly against the feudal system that the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] introduced in its domains.

In 1409 [[Martin I of Sicily]], king of Sicily and heir to the crown of Aragon, defeated the Sardinians at the [[Battle of Sanluri]] (''Sa battalla de Seddori'' in Sardinian). The battle was fought by about 20,000 Sardinians, who had taken up arms voluntarily at a time when the population of Sardinia had been greatly depleted by the plague (and therefore 20,000 Sardinians represented a very considerable number). Despite the Sardinian army outnumbering the Aragonese army, they were defeated. It is estimated that about 5,000 Sardinians were killed in the battle. A field near Sanluri is still known to this day as ''S'Occidroxiu'' ("the massacre place").

The kingdom of Arborea finally surrendered only after some of its most notable men switched sides in exchange for privileges. For example, Leonardo Cubello, with some claim to the crown being from a family related to the Kings of Arborea, was granted the title of Marquis of Oristano and feudal rights on a territory that partly overlapped with the original extension of the Kingdom of Arborea in exchange for his subjection to the [[King of Aragon]].

The successes of the Kingdom of Aragon were marred by the death of the heir to the Aragon crown, Martin I of Sicily, who died in [[Cagliari]] (where he is buried) of [[malaria]] contracted during the military campaign against the Kingdom of Arborea. Consequently the Crown of Aragon passed to a different dynasty, the Trast<U+00E0>maras, to [[Ferdinand I of Aragon]] and his descendants through the [[Compromise of Caspe]] in 1412.

The conquest of Sardinia by the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and the consequent loss of independence also meant the introduction of the feudal system throughout Sardinia. Thus Sardinia is probably the only European country where feudalism was introduced in the transition period from the Medieval to the [[Modern Era]], at a time when feudalism had already been abandoned by many other European countries.

=== Modern history ===

In 1479, as a result of the marriage of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabel of Castile]], the "[[Kingdom of Sardinia]]" (which was separated from Corsica) became Spanish, with the state symbol of the [[Maure|Four Moors]]. Following the failure of the military ventures against the Muslims of Tunis (1535) and [[Algiers]] (1541), [[Charles V of Spain]], in order to defend his Mediterranean territories from pirate raids by the African [[Berber people|Berbers]], fortified the Sardinian shores with a system of coastal lookout towers.

[[File:TannerMapKingdomSardinia1839.jpg|thumb|Map of [[Sardinia-Piedmont]], 1836]]

The Kingdom of Sardinia remained Spanish for approximately 400 years, from 1323 to 1720, assimilating a number of Spanish traditions, customs and linguistic expressions, nowadays vividly portrayed in the folklore parades of Saint Efisio in Cagliari (May 1), the Cavalcade on Sassari (last but one Sunday in May), and the Redeemer in Nuoro (August 28).

Many famines have been reported in Sardinia. According to Stephen L. Dyson and Robert J. Rowland, "The Jesuits of Cagliari recorded years during the late 1500s "of such hunger and so sterile that the majority of the people could sustain life only with wild ferns and other weeds" ... During the terrible [[famine]] of 1680, some 80,000 persons, out of a total
population of 250,000, are said to have died, and entire villages were devastated..."<ref>{{cite book|last=Dyson|first=Stephen L|coauthors=Rowland, Robert J |title=Archaeology and history in Sardinia from the Stone Age to the Middle Ages: shepherds, sailors & conquerors|publisher=UPenn Museum of Archaeology, 2007|location=Philadelphia|year=2007|isbn=1934536024|page=136}}</ref>

In 1708, as a consequence of the [[Spanish War of Succession]], the rule of the Kingdom of Sardinia passed into the hands of the [[Empire of Austria|Austrians]] who occupied the island. In 1717 Cardinal [[Giulio Alberoni]], minister of [[Philip V of Spain]], reoccupied Sardinia. In 1718, with the Treaty of London, Sardinia was handed over to the [[House of Savoy]].

On 28 April 1794, during an uprising in [[Cagliari]], two Piedmontese officials were killed. That was the start of a revolt (called the ''"Moti rivoluzionari sardi"'') all over the island, which culminated in the expulsion of the tyrants. On 28 December 1795 in [[Sassari]] insurgents demonstrating against feudalism, mainly from the region of [[Logudoro]], occupied the city. On 13 February 1796, in order to suppress a riot, the viceroy Filippo Vivalda gave to the Sardinian magistrate [[Giovanni Maria Angioy]] the role of Alternos, which meant a substitute of the viceroy himself. Angioy moved from Cagliari to Sassari, and during his journey almost all the villages joined the uprising, demanding an end to feudalism and the [[independence]] of Sardinia's people. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In 1799, as a consequence of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in Italy, the Dukes of Savoy left [[Turin]] and took refuge in Cagliari for some fifteen years. In 1847 the Sardinian parliaments (''Stamenti'') spontaneously renounced their state autonomy and formed a union with Piedmont in order to have a single parliament, a single magistracy and a single government in Turin.

In 1848 the [[Italian Wars of Independence]] broke out for the [[Unification of Italy]] and were led by the kings of Sardinia for thirteen years. In 1861 Sardinia joined the newly founded [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].

During the [[World War I|First World War]] the Sardinian soldiers of the [[Sassari Mechanized Brigade|Brigata Sassari]] distinguished themselves, several being decorated with gold medals and other honours. It was the first and only Italian military unit constituted exclusively from Sardinian soldiers.

The Sardinian writer [[Grazia Deledda]] won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1926.

During the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] period, and implementation of the policy of [[autarky]], several swamps were reclaimed around the island and agrarian communities founded. The main communities were in the area of Oristano, where the village of Mussolinia (now called [[Arborea]]) was located, and in the area adjacent the city of [[Alghero]], within the region of [[Nurra]], [[Fertilia]] was founded. Also established during that time was the city of [[Carbonia, Italy|Carbonia]], which became the main centre of mining activity. Works to dry the numerous waste lands and the reprise of mining activities favored the arrival of settlers and immigrants, at first from [[Veneto]], and after [[World War II]] [[Istrian Italians]] and [[Dalmatian Italians]] from territories lost to [[Yugoslavia]].

The oppression by the fascist regime of its opponents within the region was ruthless. [[Antonio Gramsci]], one of the founders of the [[Italian Communist Party]], was arrested and died in prison. Michele Schirru was executed on May 29, 1931, after a failed assassination plot against [[Benito Mussolini]].

=== Post World War II Period ===
In 1946 by popular referendum Italy became a republic, with Sardinia administered since 1948 by special statute of autonomy. By 1951, [[malaria]] was successfully eliminated with the support of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], which facilitated the commencement of the Sardinian tourist boom, mainly focused on beach holidays and elite tourism. Today about ten million people visit the island every year.

With the increase in [[tourism]], coal decreased in importance. In the 1950s and 1960s the greatest Sardinian [[Human migration|migration]] began. However, in the early 1960s an [[industrialization]] effort was commenced, the so-called ''Piani di Rinascita'' (rebirth plans), with the initiation of major infrastructure projects on the island. These included the construction of new dams and roads, reforestation, agricultural zones on reclaimed marshland, and large industrial complexes (primarily oil refineries and related petrochemical operations). With the creation of [[petrochemical]] [[industries]], thousands of ex-farmers became industrial workers. Nevertheless, the [[1973 oil crisis]] caused the termination of employment for thousands of workers employed in the petrochemical industries.

The [[economic crisis]],{{When|date=July 2011}} [[unemployment]], and the establishment of [[military base]]s in the island (70% of Italian military bases were located in Sardinia) aggravated the crime rate,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} with increasing [[kidnappings]] and [[political subversion]]. [[Communist]] groups flourished, the most famous being Barbagia Rossa, which perpetrated several terrorist actions between the 1970s and the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sisde.it/gnosis/Rivista3.nsf/ServNavigE/7 |title=Sardinia, a political laboratory |publisher=GNOSIS, Italian Intelligence Magazine}}</ref>

In 1983 a militant of an autonomist-indipendentist party, the [[Sardinian Action Party]] (Partito Sardo d'Azione), was elected president of the regional parliament, and in the 1980s several [[separatism|indipendentist]] movements were born; in the 1990s some of them became political parties, and in 2006 in the Province of Sassari the first separatist militant was elected. In 1999 the local languages ([[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], [[Sassarese language|Sassarese]], [[Gallurese]], [[Algherese]] and [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Tabarchino]]) received official status together with [[Italian language|Italian]].

Today Sardinia is phasing in as an [[European Union|EU]] region, with a diversified economy focused on tourism and the tertiary sector. The economic efforts of the last twenty years have reduced the handicap of insularity, especially in the fields of low-cost air travel and advanced [[information technology]]. For example, the [[CRS4]] (Center for Advanced Studies, Research and Development in Sardinia) developed the first Italian [[website]] in 1991 and [[webmail]] in 1995. CRS4 allowed several telecommunication companies and internet service providers based on the island to flourish, such as Videonline in 1994, [[Tiscali]] in 1998 and [[3 Italy|Andala Umts]] in 1999.

A [[G8]] summit was planned to be held in Sardinia, on the island of [[La Maddalena]], in July 2009. However in April 2009, the Italian Prime Minister, [[Silvio Berlusconi]], decided, without convoking the Italian parliament or consulting the governor of Sardinia, to move the summit, even though the works were almost completed, to [[L'Aquila]], provoking protests among Sardinians that the autonomous status of Sardinia had been violated.

== Economy ==
[[File:Porto Torres - chemical industry.jpg|thumb|Petrochemical industries in [[Porto Torres]]]]

Taken as a whole, Sardinia's economic conditions are such that the island is in the best position among Italian regions located south of Rome. The greatest economic development has taken place inland, in the provinces of [[Cagliari]] and [[Sassari]], characterized by a certain amount of enterprise. According to [[Eurostat]], the 2007 [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] was <U+20AC>33,823.2 million, resulting in a <U+20AC>20,627 [[Gross domestic product|GDP per capita]], in 2009.

The Sardinian economy is penalized due to high costs of transportation of goods and electricity, which is double compared to the continental Italian regions, and triple compared to the [[EU]] average. Sardinia is the only Italian region that produces a surplus of electricity, which supply power to the region, and does not import power from abroad, whereas the problem the region had encountered was insufficient transmission links as it is an island situated over 100&nbsp;km from the mainland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.power-technology.com/projects/fiume-santo/ |title= power-technology.com |accessdate=|work= |publisher= |date= }}</ref> In 2009 the new [[submarine power cable]] [[Sapei]] entered into operation, it links the Fiume Santo Power Station, in Sardinia, to the converter stations in [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]], in the Italian peninsula, the [[SACOI]]  is another [[submarine power cable]] that links Sardinia to Italy, crossing [[Corsica]], from 1965.
The under construction submarine gas pipeline [[GALSI]], will link [[Algeria]] to Sardinia and further Italy, in 2012.

The [[per capita income]] in Sardinia is the highest of [[Southern Italy]], with 16,540 euros per person.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2011-03-11/ricchi-italia-calano-cento-063706.shtml?grafici  |title= Income per capita of italian regions in 2010 (in italian language) }}</ref>

The unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 8.6%, by the first quarter of 2010 the unemployment rate increased to 16.1%. The rise in unemployment was due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007<U+2013>2010|global financial crisis]] that hit Sardinian exports, mainly focused on refined oil and chemical products.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agi.it/research-e-sviluppo/notizie/201006251213-eco-rt10108-lavoro_in_sardegna_disoccupazione_record_al_16_1_i_trim_2010  |title= LAVORO: IN SARDEGNA DISOCCUPAZIONE RECORD AL 16, 1% (I TRIM. 2010) (in italian language) }}</ref>

[[File:Percentualesettorioccupazionalisardegna.png|thumb|300px|A pie chart showing the economic sectors percentages in the Sardinian economy: 8.7% the primary sector (fishing, agriculture, farming), 23.5% the secondary sector (industry, machinery, manufacturing), and 67.8% the tertiary sector (tourism, services, finance)]]
The primary sector is still of outstanding importance, especially goat and sheep rearing (good production of cheese). Agriculture has been modernized on the [[Campidano]] plain (vegetables, citrus, rice), and Sardinian wines are famous. There is little fishing (and no real maritime tradition), but the once prosperous mining industry is still active though restricted to [[coal]] ([[Carbonia, Sardinia|Carbonia]], Bacu Abis), [[antimony]] ([[Villasalto]]), [[gold]] ([[Furtei]]), [[bauxite]] ([[Olmedo, Sardinia|Olmedo]]) and [[lead]] and [[zinc]] ([[Iglesiente]], [[Nurra]]). The [[granite]] extraction represents one of the most flourishing industries in the northern part of the island. The Gallura granite district is composed of 260 companies that work in 60 quarries, where 75% of the Italian granite is extracted. The [[cork (material)|cork]] district, in the northern part of the [[Gallura]] region, around [[Calangianus]] and [[Tempio Pausania]], is composed of 130 companies and has become the driver of Sardinian economic development. Every year in Sardinia 200,000 quintals of cork are carved, and 40% of the end products are exported. Fishing along the coasts is also an important activity on the island. [[Portoscuso]] tunas are exported worldwide, but primarily to [[Japan]].

The principal industries are chemicals ([[Porto Torres]], [[Cagliari]], [[Villacidro]], [[Ottana]]), petrochemicals ([[Porto Torres]], [[Sarroch]]), metalworking (Porto Scuso, Porto Vesme, [[Villacidro]]), cement ([[Cagliari]]), pharmaceutical ([[Sassari]]), shipbuilding  ([[Arbatax]], [[Olbia]], [[Porto Torres]]), oil rig construction ([[Arbatax]]), and food (sugar refineries at [[Villasor]] and Oristano, dairy at [[Arborea]], [[Macomer]] and [[Thiesi]], fish factory at Olbia). Craft industries include rugs, jewellery, textile, lacework, basket making, and coral.

The Sardinian economy is today focused on the overdeveloped tertiary sector (67.8% of employment), with [[commerce]], [[tertiary sector of the economy|services]], [[information technology]], [[public administration]] and especially on [[tourism]], which represents the main industry of the island with 2,721 active companies and 189,239 rooms. In 2008 there were 2,363,496 arrivals (up 1.4% on 2007). In the same year, the airports of the island registered 11,896,674 passengers (up 1.24% on 2007).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regione.sardegna.it/j/v/25?s=107552&v=2&c=3692&t=1 |title=Il turismo in Sardegna <U+00E8> cresciuto anche nel 2008 - Regione Autonoma della Sardegna |publisher=Regione.sardegna.it |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>

== Transport ==
=== Airports ===
[[File:Meridiana A319 EI-DFP.jpg|thumb|[[Airbus A319]] of Sardinian airline [[Meridiana Fly]]]]
Sardinia has three international airports ([[Alghero Airport]], [[Olbia - Costa Smeralda Airport]], and [[Cagliari-Elmas Airport]]) connected with the principal Italian cities and many European destinations, mainly in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Spain]], and [[Germany]], and two regional airports ([[Oristano-Fenosu Airport]] and [[Tortol<U+00EC> Airport]]). Internal air connections between Sardinian airports are limited to a daily Cagliari-Olbia flight, and Tortol<U+00EC>-Olbia flight.<ref>[http://www.meridiana.it/en/destinations/destination_detail.aspx?code=ttb Fly to Tortol<U+00EC> from Olbia]</ref> Sardinian citizens benefit from special sales on plane tickets, and several low-cost air companies operate on the island. [[Meridiana|Meridiana Fly]] is an airline based in the airport of [[Olbia]]; it was founded as [[Alisarda]] in 1963 by the [[Aga Khan]], Prince [[Karim al-Hussayni]].
The development of the Meridiana airlines followed the development of the resort village of [[Porto Cervo]] in the north east part of the island, a well known vacation spot among billionaires and movie stars worldwide.

=== Ship transport ===
[[File:Mega smeralda bastia.JPG|thumb|Corsica<U+2013>Sardinia Ferries]]
The ferry companies operating on the island are [[Tirrenia di Navigazione]], [[Moby Lines]], [[Corsica Ferries]], Grandi Navi Veloci, [[Snav]], [[SNCM]], and [[Compagnie M<U+00E9>ridionale de navigation|CMN]]; they link the Sardinian harbors of [[Porto Torres]], [[Olbia]], [[Golfo Aranci]], [[Arbatax]], [[Santa Teresa Gallura]], [[Palau]] and [[Cagliari]] with [[Civitavecchia]], [[Genoa]], [[Livorno]], [[Naples]], [[Palermo]], [[Trapani]], [[Piombino]] in [[Italy]], [[Marseille]], [[Toulon]], [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]], [[Propriano]] and [[Ajaccio]] in [[France]], and [[Barcelona]] in [[Spain]]. A regional ferry company, the [[Saremar]], links the main island to the islands of [[La Maddalena]] and [[Carloforte|San Pietro]], and from 2011, also the port of [[Olbia]] with [[Civitavecchia]].

=== Roads ===
[[File:Bus ARST mercedes benz citaro 2 .jpg|thumb|a bus of Sardinia public transport authorities (Arst) in Sassari]]
Sardinia is the only Italian region without  [[motorways]], but the road network is well developed, with a system of "[[superstrade]]" ([[dual carriageway|dual carriage]] [[freeways]]), that connect the principal towns and the transport infrastructures; the speed limit is 90&nbsp;km/h. The principal road is the [[Strada statale 131 Charles Felix|SS131]] "[[Carlo Felice]]", linking the north with the south of the island, crossing the most populated regions of [[Sassari]] and [[Cagliari]]; it is part of [[European route]] E25. The [[Strada statale 131 Diramazione Centrale Nuorese|SS 131 d.c.n]]  links [[Oristano]] with [[Olbia]], crossing the hinterland [[Nuoro]] region. Other roads designed for high-capacity traffic link [[Sassari]] with [[Alghero]], [[Sassari]] with [[Tempio Pausania]], [[Sassari]] - [[Olbia]], [[Cagliari]] - [[Tortol<U+00EC>]], [[Cagliari]] - [[Iglesias]], [[Nuoro]] - [[Lanusei]]. A work in progress is converting the main routes to [[highways]] standards, with the elimination of all [[Intersection (road)|intersections]]. The secondary inland and mountain roads are generally narrow with many [[hairpin turn]]s, so the speed limits are very low.
[[Public transport]] [[buses]] reach every town and village at least once a day; however, due to the low density of population, the smallest territories are reachable only by car. The Azienda Regionale Sarda Trasporti ([[Arst]]) is the public regional bus transport agency.

===Railways===
[[File:Minuetto Diesel Cagliari.jpg|thumb|Alstom Minuetto in Cagliari railway station]]
The Sardinian railway system was developed in the 19th century, by the English engineer Lord Benjamin Piercy. Trains connect the whole island, and there are two different railway operators. [[Trenitalia]] is the largest, connecting the largest towns, the main ports, and also the Italian peninsula through the use of [[train ferry|train ferries]]. This network is the most modern on the island, running primarily diesel locomotives such as the [[Alstom]] "Minuetto" and, from 2012, speed [[tilting trains]] such as the Spanish [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]] Class 598 or the [[Talgo XXI]]. The second operator is ARST Gestione FdS, best known as [[Ferrovie della Sardegna]] (Sardinian Railways), running on [[narrow gauge railways|narrow-gauge]] track, and they are generally very slow, except the electrified [[tram-trains]], operating in the metropolitan areas of [[Sassari Tram-train|Sassari]] and [[Cagliari]]. Many tourists catch the ''trenino verde'', which runs through the wildest parts of the island. It is slow but allows the traveller to have scenic views impossible to see from the main road.

With a population density of 69/km<sup>2</sup>, slightly more than a third of the national average, Sardinia is the fourth least populated region in Italy. The population distribution is anomalous compared to that of other Italian regions lying on the sea. In fact, contrary to the general trend, urban settlement has not taken place primarily along the coast but towards the centre of the island. Historical reasons for this include repeated [[Saracen]] raids during the [[Middle Ages]] (making the coast unsafe), widespread pastoral activities inland, and the swampy nature of the coastal plains (reclaimed only in the 20th century). The situation has been reversed with the expansion of seaside tourism; today all Sardinia's major urban centres are located near the coasts, while the island's interior is very sparsely populated.

It is the Italian region with the lowest [[total fertility rate]]<ref>[[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] [http://demo.istat.it/altridati/indicatori/2005/Tab_4.pdf Numero medio di figli per donna per regione 2002-2005]</ref> (1.087 births per woman), and the region with the second lowest [[birth rate]];<ref>[[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] [http://demo.istat.it/altridati/indicatori/2005/Tab_1.pdf Tassi generici di natalit<U+00E0>, mortalit<U+00E0> e nuzialit<U+00E0> per regione 2002-2005]</ref> these factors, together with the high level of urbanization of population, allow the preservation of the greater part of the natural environment. However, the population has increased in recent years due to immigration, mainly from [[Eastern Europe]] (esp. [[Romania]]), [[Africa]] and [[China]].

At the end of 2009 there were 33,000 foreign national residents, forming 2% of the total Sardinian population.<ref name = Istat >[http://www.istat.it/salastampa/comunicati/in_calendario/inddemo/20100218_00/testointegrale20100218.pdf Rapporto Istat - La popolazione straniera residente in Italia al 31<U+00BA> dicembre 2009]</ref><ref>[http://demo.istat.it/str2009/index.html ISTAT - Cittadini Stranieri.

Alongside [[Italian language|Italian]] (''Italiano''), the language of [[Italy]], [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] (''Sardu'') is the most diffuse language widely spoken on the island. Sardinian is a distinct branch of the [[Romance language]] family, and not an [[Italian dialects|Italian dialect]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=1729-16 |title=Ethnologue report for Sardinian |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref> The language has been influenced by [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and indigenous [[Nuragic civilization|Nuragic]] elements with some roots from [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] and [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} While it has been significantly supplanted by Italian for official purposes, in 2006 the regional administration has approved the use of Limba Sarda Comuna<ref>http://www.regione.sardegna.it/documenti/1_72_20060418160308.pdf</ref> in official documents. As a literary language, it is gaining importance, despite heated debate about the lack of standard orthography and controversial proposed solutions to this problem. The two most widely spoken forms of the Sardinian language are [[Campidanese language|Campidanese]] (''Sardu Campidanesu''), spoken throughout the southern half of the island, and [[Logudorese language|Logudorese]] (''Sardu Logudoresu''), from the northern-central region, extending almost to the suburbs of [[Sassari]].

The [[Sassarese language|Sassarese]] (''Sassaresu'') and [[Gallurese language|Gallurese]] (''Gaddhuresu'') varieties are often termed Corso-Sardinian dialects. Spoken in the extreme north of Sardinia, they are sometimes considered as independent languages or to be part of [[Corsican language|Corsican]] rather than Sardinian.

In Sardinia there are examples of [[Language island|language islands]]: [[Algherese]] (''Alguer<U+00E9>s'') is a variant of [[Catalan language|Catalan]] spoken in the city of [[Alghero]]; on the islands of [[San Pietro Island|San Pietro]] and [[Sant'Antioco]], located in the extreme south west of Sardinia, the local population speaks a variant of [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]] called Tabarchino (''Tabarchin''); fewer and fewer people speak [[Venetian language|Venetian]], [[Friulian language|Friulian]] and [[Istriot language|Istriot]] in [[Arborea]] and [[Fertilia]], having been populated in the 1920s and 1930s by families who mainly came from north-eastern Italy.

== Government and politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Sardinia|List of political parties in Sardinia}}

Sardinia is one of the five [[Regions of Italy|Italian autonomous regions]], along with [[Valle d'Aosta]], [[Trentino-Alto Adige/S<U+00FC>dtirol]], [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]] and [[Sicily]]. Its statute, which is a [[Italian Constitution|constitutional law]], gives the region the right to create its own laws in a wide number of domains and to carry out regional administrative functions.

The regional administration  is constituted by three authorities:
* the Regional Council  (legislative power)
* the Regional Junta (executive power)
* the President (chief of executive power)

=== Administrative divisions ===
[[File:Sardinia Map.png|Administrative bilingual map of Sardinia|250px|thumb]]
Until 2005, Sardinia had been divided into four provinces: [[Province of Cagliari|Cagliari]], [[Province of Nuoro|Nuoro]], [[Province of Oristano|Oristano]] and [[Province of Sassari|Sassari]]. In 2005 the Regional Council decided to create four new provinces becoming operative with the provincial elections for the Presidents and the Councils held in 2006. The four additional provinces are as follows: [[Province of Carbonia-Iglesias|Carbonia-Iglesias]], [[Province of Medio Campidano|Medio Campidano]], [[Province of Ogliastra|Ogliastra]], [[Province of Olbia-Tempio|Olbia-Tempio]].

Sardinia is one of two Italian regions, with [[Veneto]], whose inhabitants have been recognised as a ''popolo'' (''people'') by the local [[statute]] which is adopted with a [[constitutional law]], although in Veneto this was not through a constitutional law.

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Sardinia}}
Sardinia is home to one of the oldest forms of vocal [[polyphony]], generally known as [[canto a tenore|cantu a tenore]] in 2005, [[Unesco]] classed the ''canto a tenore'' among intangible world heritage. Several famous musicians have found it irresistible, including [[Frank Zappa]], [[Ornette Coleman]], and [[Peter Gabriel]]. The latter travelled to the town of [[Bitti]] in the central mountainous region and recorded the now world-famous [[Tenores di Bitti]] [[CD]] on his Real World label. The guttural sounds produced in this form make a remarkable sound, similar to [[Music in the Tyva Republic|Tuvan]] throat singing. Another polyphonic style of singing, more like the [[Corsican language|Corsican]] ''paghjella'' and liturgic in nature, is found in Sardinia and is known as ''cantu a cuncordu''.
[[File:Sefisio CA6.jpg|thumb|left|The festival of Sant'Efisio in Cagliari]]
Another unique instrument is the [[launeddas]]. Three reed-canes (two of them glued together with [[beeswax]]) produce distinctive harmonies, which have their roots many thousands of years ago, as demonstrated by the bronzette from [[Ittiri]], of a man playing the three reed canes, dated to 2000 BC.

Beyond this, the tradition of cantu a chiterra ([[guitar]] songs) has its origins in town squares, when artists would compete against one another. The most famous singer of this genre are [[Maria Carta]] and [[Elena Ledda]].

Sardinian culture is alive and well, and young people are actively involved in their own music and dancing. In 2004, [[BBC]] presenter [[Andy Kershaw]] travelled to the island with Sardinian music specialist Pablo Farba and interviewed many artists. His programme can be heard on [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/worldmusic/onlocation/corsica.shtml BBC Radio 3]. Sardinia has produced a number of notable jazz musicians such as Antonello Salis, Marcello Melis, and [[Paolo Fresu]].

The main [[opera house]] of the island is the Teatro Lirico in [[Cagliari]].

=== Cuisine ===
[[File:Torta degli sposi.jpg|thumb|upright|A picture showing a lavish Sardinian [[wedding cake]]]]
[[File:Pasta e dolci.jpg|thumb|left|A range of different cakes, pastries, meals, dishes and sweets which are common elements of Sardinian cuisine]]
[[Rock lobster]], [[scampi]], [[bottarga]], squid, tuna, sardines and other seafood figure prominently in Sardinian cuisine. Suckling pig and wild boar are roasted on the spit or boiled in stews of beans and vegetables, thickened with bread. Herbs such as mint and myrtle are used. Much Sardinian bread is made dry, which keeps longer than high-moisture breads.  Those are baked as well, including ''civraxiu'', ''coccoi pinatus'', a highly decorative bread and ''pistoccu'' made with flour and water only, originally meant for herders, but often served at home with tomatoes, basil, oregano, garlic and a strong cheese.<ref>Piras, 457, 460.</ref>

=== Sports ===
[[Cagliari]] is home to [[Cagliari Calcio]], which was founded in 1920 and plays in the [[Serie A]], the Italian top division. It won the Italian Championship after the 1969/70 season, becoming the first club in [[Southern Italy]] to achieve such a result. Home matches are played at the Stadio Sant' Elia, named after the area where it is located, with a capacity of 23,486. It was built in 1970 and refurbished before the [[Italia '90]] [[football World Cup]].

[[File:Chris Atkinson - 2008 Rally d'Italia Sardegna.jpg|thumb|Rally d' Italia in [[Gallura]] (2008)]]
Sardinia also boasts a fine [[darts]] tradition, which many believe originated in the [[Sassari]] region of the country towards the end of the 15th century. In those days, the darts were carved from [[Beech]] (''Fagus'') wood and the flights were feathers drawn from the indigenous ''pollo sultano'', a bird famed for its spectacular violet-blue plumage.

In the [[Province of Sassari]] is the [[Autodromo di Mores|Mores Raceway]], the only [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] Circuit homologated by CSAI (Cars) and the [[IMF]] (Motorcycles), in Sardinia.

[[Cagliari]] hosted a [[Formula 3000]] race in 2002 and 2003 on a 2.414-km street circuit around Sant'Elia [[stadium]]. In 2003, [[Renault]] [[F1]]'s [[Jarno Trulli]] and former [[Ferrari]] driver [[Jean Alesi]] did a spectacular exhibition. At the [[Italian Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] BMW-F1 driver Robert Kubica took part in a [[Formula Three|F3]] car, as did BMW WTCC Augusto Farfus, [[GP2 Series|GP2]]'s [[Fairuz Fauzy]] and [[Vitaly Petrov]]. Since 2004 [[Olbia]] has hosted the [[Rally d'Italia Sardegna]], a [[rallying|rally]] competition in the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[World Rally Championship]] schedule. The rally is held on narrow, twisty, sandy and bumpy mountainous roads around the glamorous town of [[Porto Cervo]].
[[Cagliari]] hosts regular international [[regattas]], such RC44 championship, [[Farr 40]] World championship and [[Audi MedCup]]; all series which boast current [[America's Cup]] contenders like [[BMW Oracle Racing]], [[Mascalzone Latino]] and [[Emirates Team New Zealand]] as contenders. Part of the [[Louis Vuitton Trophy La Maddalena|Louis Vuitton Trophy]] was held in the [[Maddalena archipelago]] in 2010.

[[File:Stadio Sant'Elia -Cagliari -Italy-23Oct2008.jpg|thumb|Sant' Elia Stadium in Cagliari]]
[[Porto Pollo]], north of [[Palau (OT)|Palau]], is a bay often used by [[windsurfing|windsurfers]] and [[kitesurfing|kitesurfers]]. The bay is divided by a thin tongue of land that separates it in an area for advanced and beginning/intermediate windsurfers. There is also a restricted area for kitesurfers. Many Italian freestyle surfers come to Porto Pollo for training and 2007 saw the finale of the freestyle pro kids Europe 2007 contest. Because of a [[Venturi effect]] between Sardinia and [[Corsica]], western wind accelerates between the islands and creates the wind that makes Porto Pollo popular amongst windsurfing enthusiasts. In 2005, [[Aglientu]], hosted the Kitesurf World Cup in the [[Trinit<U+00E0> d'Agultu e Vignola|Vignola]]'s beach.
<br />
Sa Istrumpa, also known as Sardinian Wrestling, is a traditional Sardinian sport, officially recognized by the [[Italian National Olympic Committee]] (C.O.N.I.) and International Federation of Celtic Wrestling (I.F.C.W.).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://celtic-wrestling.tripod.com/id17.html |title='&#39;International Federation of Celtic wrestling'&#39; |publisher=Celtic-wrestling.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref>

=== World Heritage Sites ===
Megalithic building structures called [[nuraghe]] are scattered in great number throughout Sardinia. [[Su Nuraxi di Barumini]] is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>UNESCO, 2008</ref>

== Environment ==
[[File:Wind farm in Sardinia.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A wind farm in [[Sedini]] [[Province of Sassari|(SS)]]]]
The island has some environmental laws, after an enormous plan of reforestation it has become the Italian region with the largest forest extension, with 1,213,250 hectares of woods.<ref>Sardegna prima per superficie forestale e assorbimento di Co2. May 2007 . [http://www.sardegnaambiente.it/j/v/152?s=67494&v=2&c=1562&t=1]</ref> The Regional Landscape Plan prohibits new building activities on the coast (except in urban centers), next to forests, lakes or other environmental or cultural sites and the [[Conservatoria delle Coste|Coastal conservation agency]] ensures the protection of  natural areas on the Sardinian coast. [[Renewable energies]] have increased noticeably in recent years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sardegnaricerche.it/documenti/13_143_20080917122727.pdf |title='&#39;Sardinia: A natural lab for renewable energy'&#39;, Sardegna Rocerche |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref> mainly [[wind power]], favoured by the windy climate, but also [[solar power]] ([[Carlo Rubbia]], Nobelist in physics, is creating an experimental [[solar thermal energy]]  central) and [[biofuel]], based on [[Jatropha oil]] and [[Colza oil]]. 467.10 megawatts of [[wind power]] capacity were installed on the island at 2008.<ref>http://www.giann.net/?p=420 Avanza l<U+2019>energia eolica in Italia: dal Sud [e isole] l<U+2019>88% della potenza prodotta</ref>

===Fauna and Flora===
[[File:La peonia del Gennargentu.jpg|thumb|Paeonia of [[Gennargentu]], flower symbol of Sardinia]]
Sardinia is home to a wide variety of rare or uncommon animals and native plants and animals, such as a few species of [[mammals]]: the [[Mediterranean Monk Seal]], the [[Giara horse]], the [[Albino Donkey]], the [[Mouflon]], the [[Sardinian Long-eared Bat]], the [[Sardinian Deer]], the Sardinian fox, and the [[wild boar]]. Found only in Sardinia, [[Sicily]], and the [[Maghreb]], the Sardinian [[skink]] (''Chalcides ocellatus''), known more commonly as the ''tiligugu'', can reach {{convert|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in length, of which almost half consists of the tail. Conversely, Sardinia lacks many common species such as the [[Viperinae|viper]] and the [[marmot]], which are found everywhere else on the European continent. The island has also long been used for grazing flocks of indigenous [[Sardinian sheep]]. Sardinia has four endemic subspecies of birds found nowhere else in the world: its [[Great Spotted Woodpecker]] (ssp harterti), [[Great Tit]] (ssp ecki), [[Chaffinch]] (ssp sarda), and Eurasian [[Jay]] (ssp ichnusae). It also shares a further 10 endemic subspecies of bird with [[Corsica]]. In some cases Sardinia is a delimited part of the species range. For example, the subspecies of [[Hooded Crow]], ''[[Corvus cornix]]'' ssp ''cornix'' occurs in Sardinia and Corsica, but no further south.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=26307 |title='&#39;Hooded Crow: Corvus cornix'&#39;, GlobalTwitcher.com, ed, N.
