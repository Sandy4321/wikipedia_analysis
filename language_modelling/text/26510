'''''The Battle of Russia''''' is the fifth film of [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[Why We Fight]]'' [[propaganda film]] series, and the longest film of the series.

The film begins with an overview of previous failed attempts to conquer Russia: by the [[Teutonic Knights]] in 1242 (footage from [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s film ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|Alexander Nevsky]]'' is used here), by [[Charles XII of Sweden]] in 1704 (footage from [[:ru:<U+041F><U+0435><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432>, <U+0412><U+043B><U+0430><U+0434><U+0438><U+043C><U+0438><U+0440> <U+041C><U+0438><U+0445><U+0430><U+0439><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> (<U+0440><U+0435><U+0436><U+0438><U+0441><U+0441><U+0451><U+0440>)|Vladimir Petrov]]'s film ''[[:ru:<U+041F><U+0451><U+0442><U+0440> <U+041F><U+0435><U+0440><U+0432><U+044B><U+0439> (<U+0444><U+0438><U+043B><U+044C><U+043C>)|Peter the First]]''), by [[Napoleon I]] in 1812, and by [[German Empire|Germany]] in [[World War I]].

The vast natural resources of the [[Soviet Union]] are then described, showing why the land is such a hot prize for conquerors.  To give a positive impression of the Soviet Union to the American audience, the country's ethnic diversity is covered in detail.  Later on, elements of Russian culture familiar to Americans, including the musical compositions of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s book ''[[War and Peace]]'' are also mentioned.  [[Communism]] is never mentioned at any point in the film. The start of the film also includes a quote from U.S. Gen. [[Douglas MacArthur]], who commended the Russian people's defense of their nation as one of the most courageous feats in military history.

The film then covers the Nazi conquests in the [[Balkans]], described as a preliminary to close off possible Allied counter-invasion routes, before the war against Russia was launched on June 22, 1941.  The narration describes the German "keil und kessel" tactics for offensive warfare, and the Soviet "[[defense in depth]]" used to counter this.  The [[scorched earth]] Soviet tactics, the room-to-room [[urban warfare]] in Soviet cities, and the guerilla warfare behind enemy lines are also used to underline the Soviet resolve for victory against the Nazis.

One powerful scene shows Russians swearing their [[oath]]:

:''For the burned cities and villages''
:''For the deaths of our children and our mothers''
:''For the torture and humiliation of our people''
:''I swear revenge upon the enemy''
:''I swear that I would rather die in battle with the enemy''
:''Than surrender myself my people and my country to the Fascist invaders''
:''Blood for Blood!''
:''Death for Death!''

The [[Siege of Leningrad]] and the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] conclude the film.

In order to justify the Western Allies alliance with the [[Soviet Union]], the episode, like the entire ''[[Why We Fight]]'' series, misportrayed or simply omitted many facts, which could have cast doubts on the "good guy" status of the Soviets, such as the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact|Nazi-Soviet alliance]], [[Soviet invasion of Poland]]; [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic States]], [[Winter War ]] and others.<ref name="Biskupski2010">{{cite book|author=Mieczys<U+0142>aw B.
