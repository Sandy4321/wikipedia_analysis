==WBEZ, Chicago, Illinois<U+2014>1953==
At age 23, Harrison listened to a lot of radio while he was confined to bed for [[rheumatic fever]] for a year.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} After his recovery, he approached Chicago station [[WYLL|WJJD]], but was signed instead to a contact with an educational radio station, [[WBEZ]].

==WCFL, Chicago, Illinois<U+2014>1953<U+2013>1954==
Harrison worked at [[WMVP|WCFL]] as a <U+201C>summer replacement,<U+201D> yet remained there eight months, substituting for the permanent deejays.

==WPEO, Peoria, Illinois<U+2014>1954<U+2013>1959==
Harrison became program director at [[WPEO]], [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]] and hosted the morning show as the "Morning Mayor of Peoria."{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} In just six months, Harrison made WPEO the top station. WMCA, New York would come calling.

==WMCA, New York<U+2014>1959<U+2013>1968==
Harrison, along with wife Patti, and children Brian Joseph ["B.J." taken from them much too soon], Patti, Patrick, and Michael would soon call the [[New York]] suburbs "home".

In 1959, Harrison joined [[WMCA]] as the mid-day "Good Guy." Joe O'Brien (mornings) and Harrison gave WMCA a "one-two punch" for over eight years.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Other WMCA "Good Guys" included [[Jack Spector]], [[B. Mitchel Reed]], Dan Daniel and Johnny Dark, and talk show host [[Barry Gray (radio)|Barry Gray]]. Harrison became popular with his "Housewife Hall of Fame<U+201D> feature, and participated in the 1966 WMCA Good Guy picnic. Often, he scored the highest ratings on WMCA.  WABC program director [[Rick Sklar]] took note.

==WABC (AM), New York, New York<U+2014>1968<U+2013>1979==
In 1968, when [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] morning man [[Herb Oscar Anderson]] left the station, [[Rick Sklar]] hired Harrison to replace him. Harrison was followed in the WABC day by [[Ron Lundy]].

Every year, Harrison played seasonal songs, such as his holiday greeting "May You Always<U+201D> in the winter (the Amy records single of this song made the Billboard Christmas charts in 1965), and [[Allan Sherman|Allan Sherman's]] summer camp novelty, "[[Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh]]", throughout the summer months.

WABC personalities included, along with Harrison, [[Charlie Greer]], [[Scott Muni]], [[Bob Lewis (DJ)|Bob Lewis]], Lundy, [[Johnny Donovan]], [[Dan Ingram]], "Cousin Brucie" [[Bruce Morrow]], [[Chuck Leonard]], [[Bob Cruz]], [[Frank Kingston Smith]], and [[Roby Yonge]], and others.

Harrison had a number of "trademark" phrases, such as "Every brand new day should be opened like a precious gift", "Stay well, stay happy, stay right here" and "Harry Harrison wishing you the best... because that's exactly what you deserve!<U+201D> Also, on the last day of every year, Harrison would bring his four children to work with him and at the end of his shift, he would join them in giving listeners New Year's wishes.

Harrison was let go from WABC as the station changed direction in November, 1979.

==WCBS-FM, New York<U+2014>1980<U+2013>2003==
In March 1980, Harrison became the morning personality at [[WCBS-FM]] (101.1), playing [[oldies music]]. In 1984, with Lundy joining the station, they were once again heard back-to-back. Harrison would interact with Morning Crew engineer Al Vertucci, [[Phil Pepe]], who reported sports, and joke about "wacky weather" and toupee warnings with [[Irv Gikofsky|Irv <U+201C>Mr. <U+201C>G<U+201D> Gikofsky]] (weather), Mary Jane Royce, and Sue Evans. At 7:20 AM, Harrison opened the "birthday book" and announced listener and celebrity birthdays. 

On April 25, 1997 New York City Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] issued a proclamation, naming April 25 "Harry Harrison Day" in honor of the second "Mayor."

On March 19, 2003, after a 44-year career in New York radio, Harrison left WCBS-FM, saying <U+201C>I am not retiring.<U+201D> His farewell to his loyal radio friends (from 5:30 to 10 am) was held before a packed, live audience at the [[The Paley Center for Media|Museum of Television and Radio]] in New York City. It offered old airchecks, and guest appearances by WCBS-FM colleagues [[Don K. Reed]], Bobby Jay, Steve O'Brien, Randy Davis and Dan Taylor, his replacement, as well as his son and daughter, Patti. Harrison took phone calls from [[Bob Shannon (WCBS-FM)|Bob Shannon]], Mike Fitzgerald, Ed Baer and [[Ron Lundy]]. Songs included [[Gladys Knight]]'s "Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)" and the [[Little River Band|Little River Band's]] "Reminiscing," before closing with "That's What Friends Are For."

Sadly, shortly after he left WCBS-FM, Harrison would lose his long-time wife, Patti, who he had always referred to as "Pretty Patti" on the air.

==WCBS-FM, New York<U+2014>2004<U+2013>2005==
Harrison returned to WCBS-FM, to the delight of his fans, with a Saturday morning show (6<U+2013>10 AM) in 2004. It offered two hours of variety and two hours of [[Beatles]] music and memories. 

On [[Memorial Day]], May 30, 2005, Harry and Cousin [[Bruce Morrow]] were guests on WABC Radio<U+2019>s annual <U+201C>[[Rewound]]<U+201D> show. Four days later, on June 3, WCBS-FM ended its "oldies" format, in favor of the new <U+201C>Jack<U+201D> format.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Harry spends his time tending to his 5 dogs at his [[Bergen County, New Jersey]] home.
