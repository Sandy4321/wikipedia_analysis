When ''Resident Evil 2'' was still in development, Ada was known as a researcher named Linda who aided the player across the game, but was changed for the game's final form.<ref name="capcomdesign">{{cite book |title=Capcom Design Works |date=August 1, 2001 |publisher=Enterbrain, Inc |language=Japanese |isbn=4-7577-0412-7 |pages=22<U+2013>30}}</ref>  Ada's costumes include a red casual miniskirt outfit as seen in ''Resident Evil 2'', her now-iconic red dress from ''Resident Evil 4'', a black combat suit from the same game, and an outfit consisting of a red shirt with raised collar, black leather trousers and high-heeled boots from ''Resident Evil 6''.

Ada also appears as an enemy in another ''Resident Evil 2'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] game, the uncanonical ''[[Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City]]'' (2012), in which she is also a playable character in its [[multiplayer]] "Heroes" mode.<ref>Wesley Yin-Poole, [http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-12-16-resident-evil-operation-raccoon-city-adds-heroes-mode Resident Evil Operation Raccoon City adds Heroes Mode], Eurogamer.net, 16 December 2011.</ref>

Her next appearance was in ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' (2005), set in an alternate year 2004, where she assists Leon in his mission to rescue the U.S. President's daughter Ashley Graham from the sinister cult Los Illuminados based in a remote area of Spain.<ref>Alex Pham, [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/02/resident-evil-5.html Racism in Resident Evil 5?

She is dispatched for this mission alongside [[Jack Krauser]], who distrusts her and believes she is a threat to Wesker. Ada enlists the help of the researcher [[Luis Sera]], who manages to steal a sample before but is then killed by the cult's leader [[Osmund Saddler]], who briefly captures Ada, planning to sacrifice her. After meeting Leon in short battle, Ada saves him from Krauser, who was ordered by Wesker to eliminate Leon, destroys the cult's battleship and the Plaga-mutated Krauser, and aids Leon in various ways. Eventually, she is captured by Saddler, who uses her as bait to trap Leon. Leon, however, is able to free her, and Ada provides him with a special rocket launcher capable of destroying the monstrous version of Saddler, before escaping with a sample via helicopter. Ada appears in the game's sub-scenario "Assignment: Ada", as well as in the "Mercenaries" mode.

Ada is a playable character in ''[[Resident Evil 6]]'' (2012), set in 2012-2013, where she is "a lone spy working in secret"<ref name=kotaku/> available after the player finishes the storylines for its main characters Leon, [[Chris Redfield]] and Jake Muller,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/121/1216844p1.html|title=Resident Evil 6: Chris Redfield and Leon Kennedy Playable|publisher=IGN|accessdate=April 11, 2012|date=January 19, 2012|author=George, Richard}}</ref> with a campaign designed to bring the answer to some of the game's mysteries.<ref name=kotaku/> Initially single player only, Ada's campaign features the action-oriented gameplay of ''Resident Evil 4'' and ''[[Resident Evil 5]]'' but also the puzzles similar to the earlier games in the series, as well as [[stealth game|stealth]]. Ada is primarily armed with a [[crossbow]] with normal and explosive arrows and using a grapple gun, and is aided by (or "using") Leon and a new character, Helena Harper.<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/resident-evil-6/previews/ada-wong-is-resident-evil-6s-fourth-playable-character-6389394/ Ada Wong is Resident Evil 6's fourth playable character], GamesSpot, August 1, 2012.</ref> Her campaign includes a "very important" [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] battle against Helena's C-virus infected sister, Deborah.<ref name=kotaku>Toshi Nakamura, [http://kotaku.com/5931148/resident-evil-6-producers-talk-about-ada-wong--and-warn-players-not-to-get-too-gung+ho-in-agent-hunt-mode Resident Evil 6 Creators Talk About Ada Wong, And Warn Players Not To Get Too Gung-Ho In Agent Hunt Mode], Kotaku, August 2, 2012.</ref> In the game, it is revealed that Ada is a former associate of the rogue [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Adviser]] Derek C.

This Ada is the main villain of the game, leading the Neo-Umbrella responsible for unleashing C-virus outbreaks and fighting against the Bio-terrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA) forces led by Chris Redfield (at one point, Leon gets into a brief fight with Chris to allow her to escape, thinking she is the Ada that he knows), first in the fictitious Republic of Edonia in Eastern Europe and then in the fictitious city of Lanshiang, China. After learning the truth about herself, the vengeful Carla conspired against Simmons and decided to infect the entire world. She eventually succeeds in infecting Simmons in revenge but then she is shot dead by his men. After destroying the resurrected, mutated Carla, and parting ways with Leon, the real Ada destroys Carla's "greatest creation" before it could fully hatch from its cocoon. After that, Ada receives a phone call from her organization about a new job, which she accepts. Ada's sidekick in ''Resident Evil 6'' is the mystery 'Agent' and he does not appear in any of the cinematic scenes, as he was added post release via a [[Patch (computing)|patch]] to be an optional online [[cooperative multiplayer]] partner during her campaign.<ref>Tom Ivan, [http://www.computerandvideogames.com/383967/resident-evil-6-update-improves-camera-unlocks-ada-co-op/ Resident Evil 6 update improves camera, unlocks Ada co-op], CVG UK, 17th December 2012.</ref> In addition, both Carla-Ada and the real Ada are also [[Unlockable (gaming)|unlockable]] playable characters for the game's "Mercenaries" mode.<ref>[http://www.cheatcc.com/ps3/residentevil6cheatscodes.html Resident Evil 6], Cheat Code Central.</ref>

==Reception==
{{quote box|quote="Unlike [[Jill Valentine|Jill]] and [[Claire Redfield|Claire]], whose cleverness and puzzle-solving skills were well-matched to intricate, booby-trapped mansions and police stations, Ada's character has been molded to fit the [[Leon S. Kennedy|Leon]] scenarios' faster-paced, shooter-style gameplay. Even in ''[[Resident Evil 2|RE2]]'', she is a character explored entirely in sound bites: Charismatic. Single-minded. Cunning. Vixen. Mysterious. She's definitely the modern image of "[[girl power]]," but is that enough to make her an admirable [[Feminist theory|feminist]]? (...) So yes, Ada is definitely a feminist icon, and an admirable one at that. But, you know, that doesn't make her ''nice''.

Ada was generally very well received by critics.

Ada has been often described as one of the most sexy female characters in all of video gaming.

On the other hand, there was also some criticism of the character.
