The '''L-40 Meta Sokol''' was a [[Czechoslovakia]]n sports and touring four-seat single-engine low-wing aircraft of the late 1950s.

==Development==
A predecessor of the L-40 was a sports and touring plane [[Mr<U+00E1>z Sokol|M-1 Sokol]] of wooden construction. Next there was a sports plane with [[V-tail]] '''LD-40''', designed by Zdenek Rubli<U+010D>. Its prototype XLD-40 was flown on 30 July [[1950 in aviation|1950]], however, it did not meet required performance and was abandoned. In 1954 the design of a further improved variant, the LD-40 started again, with the [[Empennage|tail]] changed to a conventional one. The plane had a number of shortcomings, and further work continued. Evantually the aircraft was redesigned as a four-seater touring aircraft, under the designation '''L-40 Meta Sokol'''. 

The prototype of the L-40, the '''XL-40''', flew first on 29 March 1956. Another prototype flew in August 1956, introducing some simplification of construction. In [[1957 in aviation|1957]] the aircraft entered production, and by [[1959 in aviation|1959]], 106 were built.<ref name=numb/> The first series of 10 aircraft had 77&nbsp;kW (103&nbsp;hp) [[Walter Minor]] III-4 engine, with the remainder powered by more powerful (103&nbsp;kW (138&nbsp;hp)) [[Avia M332|Walter M-332]] engines. Four persons sat in two rows, with dual controls. An unusual feature is the inverted [[tricycle gear]], with main gear near the wing's leading edge and relatively big rear wheel near the wing's rear edge, which resulted in the fuselage being almost horizontal on the ground.

==Use==
The primary user was the Czechoslovak civilian aviation. Over half of production was exported to 16 countries, among others to Germany, Great Britain, Switzerland and Australia. Several FAI world records were set on the L-40.

==Description==
Single-engine low-wing cantilever monoplane of a metal construction. A fuselage built of a frame in front part, semi-[[monocoque]] in rear part, duralumin covered. Trapezoid three-part wing, duralumin covered, fitted with split [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]]. Conventional tail, steering surfaces were covered with canvas. A tail fin was high, trapezoid.  The plane had four seats in two rows, with twin controls in front. All were placed under a slim partly glazed [[aircraft canopy|canopy]], sliding rearwards. At the rear, there was some luggage space. Inline engine in front, with two-blade tractor propeller V-410 of a variable pitch. Retractable inverted [[tricycle gear]]. The main gear's wheels are only half hidden in wings, making emergency landings safer. Fuel tanks were in wings, there could be also fitted small teardrop tanks to wingtips.
