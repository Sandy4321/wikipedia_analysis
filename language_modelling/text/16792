==Development==
On August 27, 2007, ''Behemoth'' was announced and revealed to be a roller coaster in the works from world renowned [[Switzerland|Swiss]] manufacturer [[Bolliger & Mabillard]].

When completed, ''Behemoth'' became the 15th roller coaster at the park.<ref name="behemoth_press_release">{{cite web |url=http://attraction.canadaswonderland.com/public/news/ |title=Behemoth News: Wonderland's Biggest Investment in History |accessdate=2007-09-15 |date=2007}}</ref>

==Experience==
[[Image:Behemoth (Canada's Wonderland) 06.jpg|thumb|Point of view of the hammerhead turn from the first air-time hill]]

A ride on Behemoth lasts approximately three minutes and ten seconds.<ref name="official_stats" />

===First drop===
After departing the station, the train turns right and begins to slowly climb the lift hill through the use of a [[chain lift]]. After approximately thirty seconds, the maximum height of 70 meters is reached.<ref name="official_stats" /> From the top, a passenger can clearly see the iconic [[CN Tower]] to the left and overlook the entire park to the right. The train will drop from the peak at a 75-degree angle to reach the maximum speed of 125&nbsp;km/h (77 mph) in 3.9 seconds.<ref name="behemoth_press_release" /><ref name="official_stats" /><ref name="track_rendering">{{cite web |url=http://media.cfpl4.cedarfair.com/canadaswonderland/behemoth/images/rendering_aerial_isolated.jpg |title=Canada's Wonderland: Behemoth - Track Layout (Aerial Isoloated Rendering) |accessdate=2009-08-03 |date=2009}}</ref> The drop creates an [[air-time]] sensation for the duration of the descent.

===Air-time hills===
At the base of the first drop, the train banks a few degrees to the right and climbs the first air-time hill and descends. Following this, the train climbs up to a hairpin 180 degree [[Immelmann turn|hammerhead turn]] to the left.<ref name="track_rendering" /> The train descends from the height of the turn to travel up and over three more air-time hills. After the hills, the train climbs up a steep slope into the mid-course [[brake run]].<ref name="track_rendering" />

===Helix pair===
After the momentary reduction in speed, the train turns to the right and descends into a downward 540-degree [[helix]]. Immediately following the first helix, the train climbs into an upward 270-degree helix to the left. Following the climb is a small descent and a final hill. The train climbs up from the final hill into the terminal brake run.<ref name="track_rendering" />

===Disembarkment===
The train waits at the terminal brake run until it is cleared for return by the station. The train proceeds forward and turns 180-degrees to the left to return to the station.<ref name="track_rendering" /> At this point, the train passes directly above people waiting in the main queue below.

==Operation==

''Behemoth'' is negatively affected by unfavorable weather conditions as both a high altitude and high velocity ride. "Rain, high winds, and/or lightning" may result in the closing of the ride depending on the severity. ''Behemoth'' will close in high winds, but may remain open in light rain.<ref name="guidelines_other">{{cite web |url=http://www.canadaswonderland.com/attractions/detail.cfm?ai_id=521 |title=Canada's Wonderland: Ride Guidelines - Other Ride Policies |accessdate=2009-08-03 |date=2009}}</ref>

There is no minimum age requirement, but passengers must meet the height requirement of 137&nbsp;cm (54 inches) to ride.<ref name="cbc_thrill" /><ref name="height_restriction" /> Some persons over a certain weight/waist size will not be permitted to ride if the seat and lapbar harness cannot accommodate them.<ref name="official_stats" /> Passengers on ''Behemoth'' may not bring any loose articles onto the train and will be required to wear shirts and footwear.<ref name="guidelines_other" />

Passengers are advised that they should not ride ''Behemoth'' if they have "a history of recent surgery, heart trouble/high blood pressure, neck trouble, back trouble, or any other condition that may be aggravated by riding, or who are pregnant".<ref name="guidelines_main">{{cite web |url=http://www.canadaswonderland.com/attractions/detail.cfm?ai_id=519 |title=Canada's Wonderland: Ride Guidelines - Ride Safety |accessdate=2009-08-03 |date=2009}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Behemoth'' is the most popular attraction at Canada's Wonderland and it has enjoyed a great deal of success since its establishment.<ref name="parentcentral" /> The ride appeals to a wide demographic with park staff noting that both young children and senior citizens line up for the attraction.<ref name="cbc_thrill" /> 

The unofficial Wonderland fan club, CWMania, is impressed with the ride and considers the experience to be the invocation of "a massive and powerful mythical beast," faithful to its namesake, the [[Behemoth|biblical Behemoth]].<ref name="cwmainia">{{cite web |url=http://www.cwmania.com/rides/behemoth.php |title=CWMania: Behemoth|accessdate=2009-09-02 |date=2008}}</ref> ''Behemoth'' has also attracted a following of marathon roller coaster enthusiasts whom park staff have regarded as "celebrities, by sight, if not by name."<ref name="cbc_thrill" />

Canada's Wonderland is aware that ''Behemoth'' has become their biggest attraction and capitalizes on the success by hosting special events for the ride (some of which have been exclusive), such as the annual ''Behemethon,'' an evening of uninterrupted access for members of CWMania.<ref name="cbc_thrill" />

{{Quote|With the addition of Behemoth, we wanted to compliment our already impressive line-up of more than 200 rides, shows and attractions with a world class roller coaster that will showcase Wonderland as one of the premier amusement parks in our industry.<ref name="behemoth_press_release" />|Raffi Kaprelyan, Vice President and General Manager, Canada<U+2019>s Wonderland}}
