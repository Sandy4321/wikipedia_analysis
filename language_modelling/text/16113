The '''Southern Ontario Tornado Outbreak of 2009''' occurred in [[Southwestern Ontario]], [[Central Ontario]] and the [[Greater Toronto Area]] ([[GTA]]) on August 20, 2009, and was declared the largest single-day [[tornado]] outbreak in Canadian history. Eighteen tornadoes touched down, four of them producing at least F2 damage including the two hardest hit areas that were impacted by the F2 tornadoes that struck [[Vaughan]] and [[Durham, Ontario]]. The number of tornadoes associated with this event surpasses that of August 2, 2006, which was formerly the largest tornado outbreak in the history of Ontario. In addition, it was one of the most destructive and costly tornado events ever in Ontario, and included the death of one person in the province in recent memory. This outbreak has prompted calls for reviews of and changes to the tornado warning system in Canada.<ref name="google.com">http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5hfxQmadmLoBpmIEgqw1Sx0irkA3A</ref>

==The Tornadoes==
[[File:34 houston rd woodbridge tornado damage.JPG|thumb|200px|left|A severely damaged home in [[Vaughan]] sustains powerful [[F2]] damage at 34 Houston Rd]] During the afternoon of August 20, 2009, a series of supercell thunderstorms began to develop over southeast [[Michigan]], increasing in number as they moved into western sections of [[Southwestern Ontario]]. Beginning at around 3:00pm, the storms rapidly strengthened, with a particularly intense cell forming to the south of [[Lake Huron]]. This storm passed into [[Ontario]], travelled to the northeast through [[Huron County, Ontario|Huron County]] and into [[Grey County, Ontario|Grey County]], moving towards the town of [[Durham, Ontario|Durham]]. The first tornado touchdown occurred about 14&nbsp;km southwest of the town, and the tornado grew in size and intensity as it approached. The tornado was at its most powerful as it passed through the southeast section of [[Durham, Ontario|Durham]], causing serious structural damage to several businesses in the town's small industrial park, including the complete destruction of a press plant. Damage to homes and businesses in this area was rated at F2. Passing through and to the northeast of town, the tornado then hit a conservation area where a children's day camp was taking place. The tornado hurled debris from a gatehouse and other buildings and trees onto a tent structure where the children and counselors were seeking shelter. One eleven year old boy was killed by flying debris, while several other children suffered serious, but non life-threatening injuries.<ref>http://www.thepost.on.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1719405</ref> The tornado weakened and continued through more rural areas before striking the town of [[Markdale, Ontario|Markdale]], where F0 damage occurred to homes and trees. The total path of this tornado was 36&nbsp;km long, making it the longest track tornado in Ontario since the [[1996 Southern Ontario tornadoes|Williamsford and Arthur tornadoes]] of 1996.<ref name="weatheroffice.gc.ca">http://weatheroffice.gc.ca/warnings/SWS_bulletins_e.html?prov=on</ref><ref name="Verkaik, Arjen 1997">Verkaik, Arjen & Jerrine. '''Under The Whirlwind.''' Whirlwind Books, 1997.</ref>

The next significant tornado to touch down occurred near the town of [[Thornbury, Ontario|Thornbury]] along the shore of [[Georgian Bay]]. The tornado developed to the south of there, passing through [[Clarksburg, Ontario|Clarksburg]] and [[Blue Mountain, Ontario|Blue Mountain]], before moving out over the water. Serious damage, later rated at F2, was done to homes and chalets in this popular ski resort area. At the resort itself, Georgian Peaks, the tornado tore the roof from the Alpine Centre, pulled cables from chair lifts and ripped apart lift houses and ski ramps.<ref>http://www.owensoundsuntimes.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?archive=true&e=1711045</ref> Although damage to homes and the resort was extensive, perhaps the greatest economic toll was to the owners of local apple orchards which were severely affected. The tornadic storm responsible for the [[Grey County, Ontario|Grey County]] tornadoes weakened over the lake, having travelled and sustained its intensity for, according to [[Environment Canada]], "a remarkable 200km."<ref name="weatheroffice.gc.ca"/>

As the cell that was responsible for the Durham and Blue Mountain tornadoes moved out over [[Georgian Bay]], more cells formed and intensified ahead of and within the main line as it moved eastward. One supercell developed to the southwest of [[Barrie, Ontario|Barrie]], and produced a family of four tornadoes as it tracked to the northeast for 125 kilometers. The first touched down west of [[Barrie, Ontario|Barrie]], staying on the ground for 12.6&nbsp;km. This tornado hit rural areas between [[New Lowell, Ontario|New Lowell]] and [[Edenvale, Ontario|Edenvale]]. Two farm homes were partially unroofed, a shed collapsed and a heavy trailer was picked and moved a distance of over 100m. The second tornado caused F0 damage to cottages, homes and trees at [[Moonstone, Ontario|Moonstone]], while the third cut a 1&nbsp;km wide, 10&nbsp;km long path through the town of [[Gravenhurst, Ontario|Gravenhurst]], producing F0 damage to trees and homes. The final tornado of this family caused F1 damage to trees and cottages at [[Ril Lake, Ontario|Ril Lake]]. To the north of there, a tornado caused F0 tree damage at Dollars Lake, to the northeast of [[Britt, Ontario|Britt]], while another tornado hit and caused F1 damage at [[Arnstein, Ontario|Arnstein]] near [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]].<ref name="weatheroffice.gc.ca"/>. To the east, F0 damage occurred from a tornado at Redstone Lake near [[Haliburton, Ontario|Haliburton]], where a woman was injured by flying glass and the roofs of cottages were damaged. Nearby in [[Haliburton County, Ontario|Haliburton County]], another tornado inflicted F1 damage to trees at [[Haliburton Forest, Ontario|Haliburton Forest]].

[[File:Vaughan Mayor Linda D. Jackson speaks to CTV News about a tornado in Maple Ontario.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Vaughan Mayor [[Linda D. Jackson]] speaks to a reporter about the tornadoes]]To the south, the most prolific tornadoes in the [[GTA]] in recent memory tore through sections to the north and east of [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]]. An isolated cell produced a tornado that swept across the Royal Riding Academy in rural [[Newmarket, Ontario|Newmarket]], damaging buildings and flipping over cars and vehicles. Hundreds of people had been at the venue attending a riding show, but saw the tornado well in advance and either left the facility or sought shelter before the tornado struck. Damage here was rated at F1, and casualties may have been higher had the tornado been stronger; many sought shelter in weak structures such as barns, sheds and horse trailers, including teenagers who were uninjured after the horse trailer they were in was tossed on its side.<ref>http://www.yorkregion.com/article/95780</ref><ref>http://www.thestar.com/comment/article/687006</ref> Shortly after this tornado lifted, two stronger and more damaging tornadoes struck the city of [[Vaughan, Ontario|Vaughan]].

Behind the storm at [[Newmarket, Ontario|Newmarket]], another tornadic storm developed and ultimately produced the most damaging tornadoes in an urban area of Ontario since [[The "Barrie" Tornado Outbreak of 1985]]. Although originally thought to be one single tornado, two separate F2 tornadoes struck the city of [[Vaughan, Ontario|Vaughan]]. The first hit the Woodbridge neighbourhood in the city's southwest, traveling for 3.5&nbsp;km, flipping cars, damaging dozens of homes - many severely - as well as numerous businesses and a school. The second struck the Maple neighbourhood in the city's northeast, causing a 2.7&nbsp;km path of damage to dozens of homes. Over six hundred homes in the city were damaged by the tornadoes, with over forty of them being deemed uninhabitable immediately after the event; a handful of these homes ultimately had to be torn down and rebuilt.<ref>http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20090821/storm_vaughan_090821/20090821/?hub=TorontoNewHome</ref> Although both of these tornadoes have been rated F2, a researcher from the University of Western Ontario who studied the damage concluded that some of the destruction from one of the [[Vaughan, Ontario|Vaughan]] tornadoes may be indicitive of a lower-end F3 tornado.<ref>http://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/issues/ISArticle.asp?aid=1000340777</ref>

Following the [[Vaughan, Ontario|Vaughan]] tornadoes, the storms moved into sections of [[Central Ontario]] and [[Eastern Ontario]]. There, an F0 tornado caused minor home and tree damage near Orono, another produced F1 damage to trees and hunting cabins in the Bancroft/Carlow Mayo area, and a final confirmed tornado caused F1 roof and tree damage at Rice Lake.<ref name="weatheroffice.gc.ca"/>

==Aftermath==
[[File:Crushed car tornado aftermath on the lawn of a school in Woodbridge.jpg|200px|left|thumb|A crushed car rests on the lawn of a school in Woodbridge following the Vaughan tornadoes]]In the hours after the tornadoes touched down, States of Emergency were declared in the city of [[Vaughan, Ontario|Vaughan]]<ref>http://www.vaughantoday.ca/story.php?id=1918</ref><ref>http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/van-loan-federal-aid-for-ontario-tornado-victims-up-in-the-air/article1261365/</ref> and in [[West Grey, Ontario|West Grey]], including the town of [[Durham, Ontario|Durham]].<ref>http://www.mountforest.com/index.php?article=1247</ref> In addition, two days after the tornado that affected the [[Blue Mountain, Ontario|Blue Mountain]] area, a State of Emergency was declared there. Damage from the tornadoes in [[Grey County, Ontario|Grey County]] alone is conservatively estimated at over 30 million dollars.<ref>http://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/article/697957</ref> With damage at Vaughan estimated to be well over ten million dollars, the cost of this event surpasses that of the [[1996 Southern Ontario tornadoes]] which caused insured losses of eight million dollars, and the [[Hamilton, Ontario tornado of 2005]] which caused twenty five million dollars in damage at Lawfield Public School.<ref name="Verkaik, Arjen 1997"/> As such, the outbreak is the costliest in Ontario since 1985.

Given their intensity and urban setting, particularly the tornadoes at Vaughan, the outbreak garnered media attention unlike any other in recent years. Cable news network [[CP24]] set a viewing record with over 1.2 million tuning in.<ref>http://www.mediaincanada.com/articles/mic/20090825/stormratings.html</ref> The public interest in the tornadoes was mirrored by that of politicians; there will be a review of the tornado warning process and changes to the dissemination of severe weather warnings in Canada will be made accordingly.<ref name="google.com"/>
