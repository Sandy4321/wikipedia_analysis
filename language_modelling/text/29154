'''Edvard Bene<U+0161>''' ([[help:IPA|pronounced]] {{Audio-IPA|Cs-Edvard Benes.ogg|[<U+02C8><U+025B>dvart <U+02C8>b<U+025B>n<U+025B><U+0283>]}}) ([[May 28]] [[1884]] [[Ko<U+017E>lany]], [[Bohemia]] (then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]) <U+2013> [[September 3]] [[1948]] [[Sezimovo <U+00DA>st<U+00ED>]], [[Czechoslovakia]]) was a leader of the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] independence movement and the second [[President of Czechoslovakia]]. 

== Youth ==
He was born into a peasant family in a small village of [[Ko<U+017E>lany]] near [[Rakovn<U+00ED>k]], ca. 60 [[kilometre|km]] west of [[Prague]]. He spent much of his youth in [[Vinohrady]] district of Prague, where he attended [[grammar school]] from 1896 to 1904. After studying  at the Faculty of [[Philosophy]] of [[Charles University in Prague]], he traveled to [[Paris]] and continued his studies at the [[Sorbonne]] and at the [[<U+00C9>cole Libre des Sciences Politiques|Independent School of Political and Social Studies]] (''<U+00C9>cole Libre des Sciences Politiques''). He completed his first degree in [[Dijon]], where he received his Doctorate of Laws in 1908. Then he taught for three years at the Prague Academy of Commerce, and after his habilitation in the field of philosophy in 1912, he became a lecturer in [[sociology]] at Charles University. He was involved in [[Scouting]].<ref>{{cite web

==First exile==
During [[World War I]] he was one of the leading organizers of an independent Czechoslovakia abroad.  He organized a Czech pro-independence anti-Austrian secret resistance movement called "Maffia". In September, 1915, he went into exile where in Paris he made intricate diplomatic efforts to gain recognition from [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] independence movement, as he was from 1916<U+2013>1918 a Secretary of the Czechoslovak National Council in Paris and Minister of the Interior and of Foreign Affairs within the Provisional Czechoslovak government. 

==Czechoslovakia==
From 1918<U+2013>1935, he was first and the longest serving Foreign Minister of [[Czechoslovakia]], and from 1920<U+2013>1925 and 1929<U+2013>1935 a member of the Parliament. He represented Czechoslovakia in talks of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. In 1921 he was a professor and also from 1921<U+2013>1922 Prime Minister.  Between 1923<U+2013>1927 he was a member of the [[League of Nations]] Council (serving as president of its committee from 1927<U+2013>1928). He was a renowned and influential figure at international conferences, such as [[Genoa Conference|Genoa]] 1922, [[Locarno Treaties|Locarno]] 1925, [[Young Plan|The Hague]] 1930, and [[Lausanne Conference of 1932|Lausanne]] in 1932.  

He was a member of the [[Czechoslovak National Socialist Party]] (until 1925 called Czechoslovak Socialist Party) and a strong Czechoslovakist - he did not consider [[Slovaks]] and [[Czechs]] to be separate ethnicities.

In 1935 he succeeded [[Tom<U+00E1><U+0161> Masaryk|Tom<U+00E1><U+0161> Garrigue Masaryk]] to become President. He served as de jure President of Czechoslovakia from 1935 to 1948. From 1938 to 1945 he was in exile. He was elected only twice: on 14 December 1935 and on 19 June 1946, since Art. 58 para 5 of the Constitution stipulated: The former president shall stay in his or her function till the new president shall not be elected. (''"D<U+0159><U+00ED>v<U+011B>j<U+0161><U+00ED> president z<U+016F>st<U+00E1>v<U+00E1> ve sv<U+00E9> funkci, pokud nebyl zvolen president nov<U+00FD>."'') He was confirmed as the former president of the republic by the National Assembly on 28 October 1945 by unanimous vote.[http://psp.cz/eknih/1945pns/stenprot/002schuz/s002001.htm]

==Second exile==
In October 1938, after the [[Munich Agreement]] ceded the predominantly German speaking [[Sudetenland]] to Germany, but before the German occupation of the Czech speaking remainder of Bohemia and Moravia, he resigned from office and went into exile in Putney, [[London]]. Then in 1940 he organized the [[Czechoslovakia: World War II (1939 - 1945)#Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile|Provisional Government-in-Exile]] in London with [[Jan <U+0160>r<U+00E1>mek]] as Prime Minister and himself as President. 

In November 1940 Bene<U+0161>, his wife, their nieces and his household staff moved to The [[Abbey]] at [[Aston Abbotts]] near Aylesbury in [[Buckinghamshire]]. The staff of his private office, including his Secretary Edvard T<U+00E1>borsk<U+00FD> and his chief of staff Jarom<U+00ED>r Smutn<U+00FD> moved to The Old Manor House in the neighbouring village of [[Wingrave]] while his military intelligence staff headed by [[Franti<U+0161>ek Moravec]] was stationed in the nearby village of [[Addington, Buckinghamshire|Addington]]. 

In 1941 Bene<U+0161> and his government planned the [[Operation Anthropoid]], aiming at the assassination of [[Reinhard Heydrich]]. This was implemented in 1942, resulting in brutal German reprisals such as the execution of thousands of Czechs and the eradication of two villages of [[Lidice]] and [[Le<U+017E><U+00E1>ky]].

Although oriented to the West he was also on friendly terms with Stalin. In 1943 he signed the entente between Czechoslovakia and the [[Soviet Union]] in order to secure Czechoslovakia's political position, as well as his own.

==Last years==
At the end of [[World War II]], he returned home as the President of Czechoslovakia. He resented the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist]] [[Czechoslovak coup d'<U+00E9>tat of 1948|takeover of Czechoslovakia]] on [[25 February]] [[1948]] led by [[Prime Minister]] [[Klement Gottwald]], and resigned as President on [[7 June]] [[1948]]. Gottwald succeeded him as President.  He died of natural causes at his villa in [[Sezimovo <U+00DA>st<U+00ED>]], [[Czechoslovakia]] on [[September 3]] [[1948]]. He is interred along with his wife in the garden of his villa and his bust is part of the gravestone.

The so-called ''[[Bene<U+0161> decrees]]'', which, among other things, expropriated citizens of [[Germans|German]] and [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] ethnicity, and paved the way for the eventual expulsion of the majority of Germans to Germany and Austria. The decrees are still in force to this day and remain controversial, with the expellees demanding their repeal. The Czech government's repeated assurances that the decrees are no longer applied have been accepted by the [[European Commission]] and the [[European Parliament]].
