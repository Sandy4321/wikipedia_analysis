'''Saint Restituta''' (''Santa Restituta di Teniza'', ? <U+2013> [[304]]) is a [[saint]] and [[martyr]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].<Ref>[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=4587 Catholic.org]</ref>

==Biography==
She was said to be born at ''[[Hippo Diarrhytus]]'' (today known as Bizerte, [[Tunisia]]) and became a martyr under  [[Diocletian]] while the [[Roman Empire]] was at war with [[Carthage]].<!-- This makes no sense, the [[Diocletian persecution]] was nearly 500 years after the fall of Carthage in 146 BC.-->

She was supposedly abandoned on a blazing boat, but the fire died out and she came ashore on the island of Ischia. Thus she became known as ''Restituta'', "returned" from, or "given back" by, death. 

==Veneration==
A church, the [[Santa Restituta]] was built in her honour in [[Naples]] in the sixth century. Her relics were brought there<Ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=8782631 FindAGrave.com]</ref>  in the eighth century. The church was then incorporated into the [[Cathedral of Naples]] built on the same site in the 13th century.

She is the [[patron]] of [[Lacco Ameno]], a town on the island of [[Ischia]] which also falls within the [[Province of Naples]].<ref>[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/saintr10.htm Catholic-Forum.com]</ref>
