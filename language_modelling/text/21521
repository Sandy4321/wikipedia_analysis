'''Jermaine Lee O'Neal''' (born October 13, 1978<ref name="jock" /><ref name="nbabio" />) is an [[United States|American]] professional [[basketball]] player who plays for the [[Miami Heat]] of the [[National Basketball Association]]. The 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m), 255 lb (115&nbsp;kg) [[forward (basketball)|forward]]-[[center (basketball)|center]] had a successful high school career and declared his eligibility for the [[1996 NBA Draft]] [[NBA high school draftees|straight out of high school]]. He was selected by the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] with the 17th pick of the first round, but O'Neal was unable to break into the first team in Portland and was traded to the [[Indiana Pacers]] in 2000. In his eight seasons with the club, he was voted an [[List of NBA All-Stars|NBA All-Star]] six times, made the [[All-NBA]] teams three times, and was voted the [[NBA Most Improved Player]] in the [[2001<U+2013>02 NBA season|2001<U+2013>02 season]]. He also helped Indiana reach the [[NBA Playoffs]] six times, including the Conference Finals in the [[2003<U+2013>04 NBA season|2003<U+2013>04 season]]. He was traded to the Raptors before the [[2008<U+2013>09 NBA season|2008<U+2013>09 season]] began, and traded to the Heat midway through the same season.

==Early life and high school career==
Jermaine O'Neal was born in [[Columbia, South Carolina]].<ref name="nbabio" /> Both he and his elder brother, Clifford, were raised single-handedly by his mother, Angela Ocean.<ref name="npost">Koreen, Eric, [http://www.nationalpost.com/most_popular/story.html?id=640992 "O'Neal era begins in Toronto"], nationalpost.com, 8 July 2008, accessed 5 August 2008.</ref> Ocean worked hard to support her sons, and left her children largely to their own devices. O'Neal found his love for athletics at a young age. Tall and quick, he enjoyed both [[American football|football]] and basketball, but basketball was his favorite sport. Two of his basketball heroes were [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] and [[Bill Russell]]; O'Neal often marveled at the former's approach to the game, while he loved watching the latter's video highlights of his duels with [[Wilt Chamberlain]].<ref name="jock">[http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/ONeal/ONeal_bio.html Jermaine O'Neal Bio], jockbio.com, accessed 4 August 2008.</ref>

O'Neal also played a lot of basketball. Each summer, he would play for an [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] team, and impressed onlookers with his athleticism and his ability to handle the ball with both hands. By the time he turned 14, the 6'4" O'Neal<U+2014>now a confident [[guard (basketball)|guard]] who could drain [[three-pointer]]s<U+2014>entered Eau Claire High School of the Arts as a freshman in 1992. In his first meeting with basketball coach George Glymph, he made the bold promise to become the best player in the school's history.<ref name="npost" /> While O'Neal's first season was hardly noteworthy (he even played as [[quarterback]] for the Eau Claire team)<ref name="jockbio">[http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/ONeal/ONeal_numbers.html JockBio: Jermaine O'Neal Facts], jockbio.com, accessed 4 August 2008.</ref> things changed when he grew five inches over the next year and a half, and he was inspired to develop into a defensive powerhouse like his idol Russell. Glymph built his team's defense around O'Neal, and Eau Claire featured one of the most imposing [[frontcourt]]s around. With O'Neal averaging 18 [[point (basketball)|points]], 12 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] and 9 [[block (basketball)|blocks]] a game, Eau Claire captured its third straight 3A state title in 1995.<ref name="jock" />

The following July, the 16-year-old was to raise his profile yet again. At an ABCD summer basketball camp, he outplayed [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]], a rising star at that time. Before long, recruiting letters from various top colleges came pouring in. O'Neal, however, also faced great pressure off the court. That same year, the [[District Attorney]] contemplated prosecuting him for rape after he and his 15-year-old girlfriend were found partially nude in bed together by her father.<ref name="npost" /> The DA eventually did not prosecute O'Neal, but as the latter struggled to cope with the pressure on and off the court, Glymph stepped in, introducing discipline to his life and keeping his feet to the ground. At the same time, O'Neal's mother had met a new man, Abraham Kennedy, who also guided O'Neal along.<ref name="jock" />

In his senior season at Eau Claire, O'Neal's averages of 22.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 5.2 blocks per game ensured that he was voted First Team All-State, South Carolina's Player of the Year and "Mr. Basketball". Named to USA Today's All-USA Basketball Team, he earned a spot in the McDonald's [[All-America]] Game as well. Despite being one of the nation's top prospects, O'Neal's future in college basketball was uncertain. He scored poorly on the [[Scholastic Assessment Test|SATs]], and Glymph advised against him making the leap to the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. But it was only a year before that another South Carolinian<U+2014>future [[List of NBA All-Stars|NBA All-Star]] [[Kevin Garnett]]<U+2014>had made a seamless transition from high school to the NBA, and O'Neal thought he could emulate Garnett.<ref name="jock" />

==NBA career==
===Portland Trail Blazers===
O'Neal was selected by the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] as the 17th pick in the [[1996 NBA Draft]].<ref name="nbabio">[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/jermaine_oneal/bio.html Jermaine O'Neal Bio], nba,com, accessed 4 August 2008.</ref> The rookie was surrounded by veterans and emerging stars who could show him the ropes in Portland; forming the frontcourt with him were [[Arvydas Sabonis]], [[Rasheed Wallace]] and [[Clifford R. Robinson]]. After missing the first 17 games with a bone contusion in his knee, O'Neal made his debut against the [[Denver Nuggets]] in December. At 18 years, one month and 22 days, he became the youngest player to play in an NBA game (a mark that has since been eclipsed by [[Andrew Bynum]]).<ref>[http://www.nba.com/lakers/roster/0607_17bynum.html Andrew Bynum Bio], nba.com, accessed 13 August 2008.</ref>
Portland was mediocre in the first half of the campaign, but came to form as [[1997 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] approached and managed to finish third in the [[Pacific Division (NBA)|Pacific Division]] with a 49<U+2013>33 win<U+2013>loss record.<ref name="nba9697">[http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1997.html 1996-97 NBA Season Summary], basketball-reference.com, accessed 13 August 2008.</ref> While fans at the [[Rose Garden (arena)|Rose Garden]] harbored thoughts of an upset against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in the first round of the playoffs,<ref name="jock" /> the Trail Blazers succumbed in four games.<ref name="nba9697" /> In O'Neal's first season, he appeared in a total of 45 games in the regular season, averaging 4.1 points and 2.8 rebounds per game.<ref name="nbastats">[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/jermaine_oneal/career_stats.html Jermaine O'Neal Career Stats], nba.com, accessed 13 August 2008.</ref> For the most part, however, he came off the bench and only averaged 10.2 minutes a game.<ref name="nbastats" /> O'Neal doubted for a while if he had made the right decision to skip college<U+2014>he watched with envy as good friend and fellow [[prep-to-pro]] draftee [[Kobe Bryant]] was enjoying a good rookie season<U+2014>but he remained confident that the best had yet to come.<ref name="jock" />

Despite his optimism, O'Neal found it difficult to break into the first team [[1997<U+2013>98 NBA season|the following season]]. [[Brian Grant]] was acquired from [[free agent|free agency]] and new coach [[Mike Dunleavy, Sr.]] planned to use Sabonis, Wallace and Grant as the starting frontcourt, while the presence of veteran [[Gary Trent]] also further reduced the sophomore's chances. Thus, O'Neal was not given meaningful minutes in the early part of the campaign, although he showed glimpses of his potential with occasional [[double double]] performances when he returned from an early-season injury.<ref name="jock" /> Portland eventually produced a similar win<U+2013>loss record as the preceding season with 46 wins, finishing fourth in the division.<ref name="nba9798">[http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1998.html 1997-98 NBA Season Summary], basketball-reference.com, accessed 14 August 2008.</ref> [[1998 NBA Playoffs|In the playoffs]], Dunleavy opted to go with a more youthful lineup: before the trade deadline, he had acquired [[point guard]] [[Damon Stoudamire]], as well as [[forward (basketball)|forwards]] [[Carlos Rogers (basketball)|Carlos Rogers]] and [[Walt Williams]]. The move was designed to bolster the team's chances in the playoffs against teams that were bigger and more physical.<ref name="jock" /> Nevertheless, for the second time in two years, the Trail Blazers were eliminated by the Lakers in four games in the first round.<ref name="nba9798" /> And just like the season before, O'Neal hardly featured for Portland, playing only three minutes in one game.<ref name="nbastats" />

The [[1998<U+2013>99 NBA season|1998<U+2013>99 season]] was initially disrupted for several months following an impasse in the [[collective bargaining]] negotiations. In the end, the league scaled down to a 50-game schedule, and Portland capitalized on the shortened campaign. Boasting one of the league's most balanced squads that also had strength in depth,<ref>[http://www.nba.com/history/season/19981999.html Spurs Tower Over NBA], nba,com/history, accessed 14 August 2008.</ref> the Trail Blazers chalked up an impressive 35<U+2013>15 record and topped the division.<ref name="nba9899">[http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1999.html 1998-99 NBA Season Summary], basketball-reference.com, accessed 14 August 2008.</ref> Dunleavy<U+2014>who would later be named [[NBA Coach of the Year]]<U+2014>led his club into [[1999 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] aiming to capture the franchise's first NBA title since 1977.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/coachfile/mike_dunleavy/ Mike Dunleavy], nba.com, accessed 15 August 2008.</ref> After sweeping the [[Phoenix Suns]] 3<U+2013>0 in the first round, Portland defeated the [[Utah Jazz]] 4<U+2013>2 to set up a showdown with the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] Finals.<ref name="nba9899" /> In Game 2, a 3-pointer by [[Sean Elliott]] in the closing seconds gave the Spurs as 86<U+2013>85 win<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/1999/playoffs/western/news/1999/05/31/blazers_spurs_game2/ Elliott's 3-pointer gives Spurs 86-85 win over Blazers], sportsillustrated.cnn.com, 2 June 1999, accessed 15 August 2008.</ref> and propelled San Antonio to win the series (the Spurs went on to win the NBA championship). O'Neal's disappointment at losing in the Conference Finals was compounded by the fact that his regular season minutes had dropped to fewer than 10 a game for the first time,<ref name="nbastats" /> and that his contributions to the team were mostly insignificant to begin with. He was having increasing doubts about his NBA career.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

However, in an unexpected move, Portland showed their willingness to invest in O'Neal by offering him a four-year contract worth $24 million.<ref name="nyt1">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03EFDB1230F932A3575AC0A9669C8B63 Blazers Acquire Davis From Pacers], query.nytimes.com, 1 September 2008, accessed 18 August 2008.</ref> However, the new deal did not translate into more playing time for the power forward in the [[1999<U+2013>2000 NBA season|1999<U+2013>2000 season]]. Portland acquired [[Detlef Schrempf]] and [[Steve Smith (basketball)|Steve Smith]] during the 1999 offseason, which meant that O'Neal was once again consigned to the bench. His statistics remained unimpressive, averaging 3.9 points and 3.3 rebounds per game during the regular season.<ref name="nbastats" /> In the meantime, the Trail Blazers continued to build on the success of their previous campaign. They notched 59 wins in the regular season, and defeated the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] and the Utah Jazz en route to reaching the Western Conference Finals.<ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2000.html 1999-00 NBA Season Summary], basketball-reference.com, accessed 15 August 2008.</ref> Up against recent perennial rivals the Los Angeles Lakers, the team relinquished a 15 point lead in the fourth quarter of the pivotal Game 7, and lost 89<U+2013>84.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/2000/playoffs/news/2000/06/04/blazers_lakers_ap/ Blazers' dry spell allows Lakers to take Game 7], sportsillustrated.cnn.com, 5 June 2000, accessed 15 August 2008.</ref> Not that O'Neal was heavily involved in any of this, however. With back-to-back Conference Finals disappointments coupled with a lack of playing time, he soon announced his intention to be traded.<ref name="nyt1" /> The Trail Blazers relented in the end and sent him to the [[Indiana Pacers]] in exchange for NBA All-Star [[Dale Davis (basketball)|Dale Davis]].<ref name="usatoday">Montieth, Mark, [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nba/pacers/2002-04-25-oneal.htm "O'Neal voted most improved"], usatoday.com, 25 April 2002, accessed 15 August 2008.</ref> This move was greeted with surprise by the Indiana fans as the Pacers had just came off an appearance in the [[2000 NBA Finals]], and the trade involved losing a quality player for an unproven quantity in O'Neal.<ref name="nyt1" /><ref name="usatoday" /> The Pacers roster also saw the departures of [[Mark Jackson (basketball)|Mark Jackson]], [[Rik Smits]] and [[Chris Mullin (basketball)|Chris Mullin]], and even coach [[Larry Bird]] stepped down. All of this meant that O'Neal arrived in [[Indianapolis]] facing intense pressure and scrutiny.<ref name="jock" />

===Indiana Pacers===
When O'Neal arrived at his new club, new coach [[Isiah Thomas]]<U+2014>who had pushed for the O'Neal/Davis trade<U+2014>told him that he simply needed to work harder on his game to succeed.<ref name="nyt2">Berkow, Ira, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2DF153DF933A15751C0A9659C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 "The Phenomenon Who Came Back"], query.nytimes.com, 20 February 2003, accessed 18 August 2008.</ref> At that time, Indiana was rebuilding and still revolved around veteran All-Star [[Reggie Miller]].  O'Neal turned out to be a revelation for his new club and it was not long before he established himself as a key player for his new team.<ref name="nyt2" /><ref name="pacer200001">[http://www.nba.com/pacers/history/franchise_history.html Year by Year with the Pacers], pacers.com, accessed 17 August 2008.</ref> Starting in 80 of the 81 regular season games he played in for the [[2000<U+2013>01 NBA season|2000<U+2013>01 season]], his statistics improved significantly as he averaged 12.9 points and 9.8 rebounds per game.<ref name="nbastats" /> The big man helped his team to a 41<U+2013>41 record and the eighth playoff [[single elimination tournament|seed]];<ref name="nba0001">[http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2001.html 2000<U+2013>01 NBA season Summary], basketball-reference.com, accessed 17 August 2008.</ref> he also led the league in total blocks (228, a franchise record),<ref name="pacer200001" /> and led the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] in double doubles.<ref name="nbabio" /> O'Neal kept up his form into [[2001 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] as well, averaging almost 9.8 points and 12.5 boards a game in the first round against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]],<ref name="nbastats" /> although the series was short-lived as the latter emerged victorious in four games.<ref name="nba0001" />

|source=-O'Neal on winning Most Improved Player<ref name="usatoday" />}}
The [[2001<U+2013>02 NBA season|2001<U+2013>02 season]] proved to be the breakthrough season for O'Neal as he earned a trio of honors: winning the [[NBA Most Improved Player Award]], being named an NBA All-Star, and making the [[All-NBA]] Third Team (becoming the second Pacer in history to do so after Reggie Miller).<ref name="nbabio" /> Leading his team in scoring (19.0) and rebounding (10.5), he chalked up 39 double doubles, which was third best in the conference and eighth best in the league.<ref name="nbabio" /> Indiana recorded 42 wins and qualified for [[2002 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] once again as the eighth seed,<ref name="nba0102">[http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2002.html 2001-02 NBA Season Summary], basketball-reference.com, accessed 31 August 2008.</ref> where they faced one of the hottest teams in the league at that time, the [[New Jersey Nets]]. The Pacers pushed the Nets all the way to Game 5, and even forced [[overtime (sport)|overtime]] twice, but the Nets prevailed in the end.<ref name="jock" /><ref name="nba0102" /> The Nets had put [[Kenyon Martin]] on O'Neal after the latter put up a 30 point, 11 rebound performance in Game 1, and they succeeded in limiting him to just 17.2 points and 7.6 rebounds per game over the series.<ref name="nbabio" /> As the Pacers reflected on yet another premature end to the postseason, they knew that O'Neal was next in line to succeed the 36-year-old Miller as the new face of the franchise. At the same time, the Pacers seemed to have found players in [[Brad Miller (basketball)|Brad Miller]], [[Ron Artest]], [[Al Harrington]] and [[Jamal Tinsley]] who complemented O'Neal.<ref name="jock" /> Indiana was on the brink of becoming a legitimate threat in the East.

The Pacers started the [[2002<U+2013>03 NBA season|2002<U+2013>03 season]] well, winning 14 of their first 16 games,<ref name="nba0203">[http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/IND/2003_games.html 2002-03 Indiana Pacers], basketball-reference.com, accessed 1 September 2008.</ref> and had the best record in the East by the time the All-Star break arrived.<ref name="pacer200001" /> The same team from the year before was playing better than ever, but the season fell apart in the latter half. For one, Brad Miller got injured and Indiana lost one of their most versatile players. Defensive lynchpin Artest suffered from too many emotional outbursts and this further hurt the Pacers,<ref name="inden">[http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/indiana/pacers.html Historical Moments], sportsecyclopedia.com, accessed 2 September 2008.</ref> who could only finish the season 48<U+2013>34.<ref name="nba0203" /> On his part, O'Neal kept up his All-Star numbers, averaging 20.8 points and 10.3 rebounds per game, being only one of three players in the NBA that year to pull off a 20/10.<ref name="jock" /> He was voted Eastern Conference Player of the Month twice, in January and April, and would go on to be named to the All-NBA Third Team again by the season's end.<ref name="nbabio" /> With no momentum heading into [[2003 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]], however, the Pacers were eliminated 4<U+2013>2 by underdogs [[Boston Celtics]],<ref name="nba0203" /> marking a first-round elimination for the third year in a row. Off the court, the team had also been facing family problems. Brad Miller's father-in-law and Tinsley's mother passed away during the season, and just before the playoffs, O'Neal's stepfather attempted suicide.<ref name="damage">Smith, Doug, "Hard times made Raptor O'Neal a family man", ''Toronto Star'', 29 October 2008.</ref> When the season ended, O'Neal tried to keep his focus on basketball and considered the possibility of joining another team since he was now a free agent. The [[San Antonio Spurs]], led by two-time NBA Champion [[Tim Duncan]], looked an interesting proposition as perennial All-Star [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] had just retired. Much as it was tempting for O'Neal to make the switch, he opted not to uproot his family and signed a seven-year, $126 million contract with the Pacers.<ref name="onealbr">[http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/onealje01.html Jermaine O'Neal], basketball-reference.com, accessed 30 September 2008.</ref> Even so, the offseason produced a few surprises for O'Neal when Isiah Thomas was replaced by [[Rick Carlisle]], and Brad Miller left for the [[Sacramento Kings]].<ref name="inden" /> Indiana was undergoing rebuilding yet again.

Despite all the changes, O'Neal spearheaded the Pacers to a league-best 61<U+2013>21 record in the [[2003<U+2013>04 NBA season|2003<U+2013>04 season]].<ref name="nba0304">[http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2004.html 2003-04 NBA Season Summary], basketball-reference.com, accessed 16 September 2008.</ref> He remained a constant double-double threat, averaging 20.1 points and 10.0 rebounds a game in the regular season.<ref name="nbastats" /> He also continued to rack up individual honors, making his third All-Star trip and being named to the All-NBA Second Team.<ref name="pacer200001" /> Artest was instrumental to the team's success too as he enjoyed a breakthrough season, netting his first All-Star berth as well as the [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]].<ref name="pacer200001" /> In [[2004 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]], Indiana gained revenge from the preceding season by sweeping Boston in the first round, before defeating the [[Miami Heat]] in the next.<ref name="nba0304" /> That sent them back to the Eastern Conference Finals for the sixth time in 11 years, where they were disposed of by eventual NBA champions [[Detroit Pistons]].<ref name="pacer200001" /> In the series-deciding Game 6, O'Neal endured a sprained knee and managed to tally 20 points and 10 rebounds, but [[Richard Hamilton (basketball)|Richard Hamilton]]'s inspired play ensured a close victory for the Pistons.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/games/20040601/INDDET/recap.html Pistons Send Pacers Packing], nba.com, 1 June 2004, accessed 16 September 2008.</ref>

The Pacers looked to build on their previous campaign in the [[2004<U+2013>05 NBA season|2004<U+2013>05 season]], but all their plans came apart in November. In a game against the Pistons at the [[Palace of Auburn Hills]], a [[Pacers<U+2013>Pistons brawl|brawl]] broke out that spilled into the stands. O'Neal was one of the Pacers who fought with some of the fans and was suspended for 25 games by NBA Commissioner [[David Stern]]; teammates Artest and [[Stephen Jackson]] were suspended for the rest of the season and 30 games respectively.<ref name="pacer200001" /> Following an appeal just before Christmas, O'Neal won a ten-game reduction in his sentence,<ref name="pacer200001" /> but this did not mitigate the damage that Indiana had already suffered. Stripped of three of its core players, the team hobbled to a 44<U+2013>38 record and the sixth seed.<ref name="nba0405">[http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2005.html 2004-05 NBA Season Summary], basketball-reference.com, accessed 26 September 2008.</ref> O'Neal appeared in only 44 games, his lowest total ever with Indiana. Although his scoring average improved to 24.3 points per game, his rebounding dropped and he was no longer the same intimidating presence on defense. Things worsened when he sprained his right shoulder in March and played sparingly for the remainder of the regular season, while hoping to recover in time for [[2005 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]].<ref name="jock" /> The Pacers drew the Celtics in the first round, and managed to salvage their season by winning the series 4<U+2013>3.<ref name="nba0405" /> O'Neal, however, was not playing as well as he could have: his offensive output dropped, and he shot poorly from the field. When the Pacers met the Pistons in the semifinals, they were eliminated in six games,<ref name="nba0405" /> capping yet another frustrating season for O'Neal.

O'Neal continued his battle against injuries during the [[2005<U+2013>06 NBA season|2005<U+2013>06 season]], and played in only 51 games. Nevertheless, he averaged a team-high 20.1 points and 9.3 rebounds a game.<ref name="nbabio" /> and was voted by the fans as the starting forward for the Eastern Conference All-Star team (he was later replaced by [[Gilbert Arenas]] due to injury).<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/allstar2006/news/story?id=2325922 ESPN - Arenas All-Star replacement for Pacers' O'Neal - NBA], sports.espn.go.com, accessed 4 August 2008.</ref> The Pacers entered [[2006 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] as the sixth seed. They eventually lost to the New Jersey Nets in six games.

O'Neal missed 13 more games in the [[2006<U+2013>07 NBA season|2006<U+2013>07 season]] as the Pacers missed the playoffs altogether. O'Neal continued to missed huge amounts of time, especially towards the end of the season, as the Pacers struggled to compete. O'Neal's production and stats declined as well. He had two years and $44 million left on his deal. The Pacers were looking to move the huge contract. On June 25, 2008, it was reported that O'Neal and the 41st pick in the [[2008 NBA Draft]], [[Nathan Jawai]] would be sent to [[Toronto Raptors|Toronto]] for [[T. J. Ford]], [[Rasho Nesterovi<U+010D>]], [[Maceo Baston]] and the 17th pick in the 2008 NBA Draft, [[Roy Hibbert]].

O'Neal was given jersey #6 for the Raptors since his number with the Pacers (#7) was already owned by [[Andrea Bargnani]]. While he was expected to combine with Toronto's three-time All-Star [[Chris Bosh]] to form a strong frontcourt and provide greater rebounding and interior defense for the Raptors,<ref>Schuhmann, John, [http://www.nba.com/preview2008/tor.html "2008-09 Season Preview: Toronto Raptors], nba.com, accessed 28 October 2008.</ref><ref>Schuuhmann, John, [http://www.nba.com/2008/news/features/john_schuhmann/10/29/schuhmann_offseasonmoves_analysis/index.html "The Numbers Game: Who will help most?"], nba.com, 29 October 2008, accessed 3 November 2008.</ref> O'Neal's arrival was dwarfed by the [[Elton Brand]] signing pulled off by division rivals [[Philadelphia 76ers|Philadelphia]].<ref name="damage" /><ref>Schuhmann, John, [http://www.nba.com/2008/news/features/john_schuhmann/10/29/sixers.raptors/index.html "Raptors' dynamic duo trumps Brand's Philly debut"], nba.com, 29 October 2008, accessed 31 October 2008.</ref> O'Neal wasted no time in imposing his style on his new team: in the season opener at Philadelphia, he pointed to hecklers in the home crowd after making a dunk;<ref>Feschuk, Dave, "Raptors' O'Neal silences the hecklers", ''Toronto Star'', 30 October 2008.</ref> in the team's second game, Toronto's center blocked a dunk from [[Golden State Warriors|Golden State's]] [[Brandan Wright]] and thereafter waved a finger, as though to say "Don't come back here again."<ref>Grange, Michael, "Raptors rolling after OT win", ''Globe and Mail'', 1 November 2008.</ref> Even so, it took O'Neal some time to find his offensive game: he reached the 20-point mark just twice in his first 23 games, before notching three straight thereafter. By the All-Star break, injuries had ruled the big man out for almost a quarter of Toronto's games, while Bargnani regained his starting spot with a streak of solid performances. This, coupled with the Raptors entering the break placed 14th in the conference and 13 games under .500, Toronto General Manager [[Bryan Colangelo]] looked to move O'Neal to bring in a wing player and free up the salary space. On February 13, 2009, O'Neal and [[Jamario Moon]] were traded to [[Miami Heat|Miami]] for [[Shawn Marion]] and [[Marcus Banks]].<ref>Aldridge, David, [http://www.nba.com/2009/news/features/david_aldridge/02/13/heatraptorstrade.20090213/index.html "Raptors trade O'Neal, Moon to Heat for Marion, Banks"], nba.com, 13 February 2009, accessed 14 February 2009.</ref> In his 41 games as a Raptor, O'Neal averaged 13.5 points, 7 rebounds and 2 blocks per game.<ref name="nbastats" />

===Miami Heat===
The Heat went 7<U+2013>5 in O'Neal's first 12 games with his new club<U+2014>including a victory over the Raptors at the [[Air Canada Centre]]<U+2014>as they looked to secure the fourth seed for [[2009 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]]. The Heat eventually concluded the regular season with a 43<U+2013>39 record and was seeded fifth.<ref name=heat0809>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2009.html 2008-09 NBA Season Summary], basketball-reference.com, accessed 14 July 2009.</ref> In the first round of the playoffs, the [[Atlanta Hawks]] defeated the Heat in seven games.<ref name=heat0809/>

In the [[2009<U+2013>10 NBA season|2009<U+2013>10]] season, Miami concluded the regular season as the fifth seed for the [[2010 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], and were up against the [[Boston Celtics]]. Boston won the series 4<U+2013>1.

==International career==
Following his breakout season in 2000<U+2013>01, O'Neal earned a spot on Team USA for the 2001 [[Goodwill Games]]. The Americans won all of their five games and the gold medal, and O'Neal led the team in blocks and shooting percentage, while finishing second in points and rebounds.<ref name="jock" /> The 2002 NBA Most Improved Player was selected to represent his nation again in the 2002 [[World Basketball Championship]] which was held in Indianapolis. This time round, the Americans had a lackluster tournament, and could only finish sixth.<ref name="usa2002">[http://www.usabasketball.com/news.php?news_page=mwc_2002 FOURTEENTH WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP -- 2002], usabasketball.com, accessed 31 August 2008.</ref> O'Neal averaged 7.3 points and 4.5 rebounds over eight games.<ref name="usa2002" /> The next year, Team USA staged a comeback in the [[2003 Tournament of the Americas]]. Winning all its ten games and the gold medal, the team qualified for the [[2004 Olympics]].<ref name="usa2003">[http://www.usabasketball.com/news.php?news_page=mtoa_2003 MEN'S TOURNAMENT OF THE AMERICAS -- 2003], usabasketball.com, accessed 20 September 2008.</ref> O'Neal featured in every game in that tournament, averaging 11.2 points and 6.2 rebounds per contest.<ref name="usa2003" /> While he was earmarked as a core member of the team that would compete in the Olympics, a knee injury prevented him from participating in the games.

==Image==
O'Neal is known for his outspokenness on race in the NBA.  After the NBA enacted its controversial age-limit to enter the [[NBA Draft]], O'Neal told reporters that he felt that race was a factor on why the NBA has a different standard than other professional sports leagues like the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] or the [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] (where players frequently enter the draft immediately after high school).
