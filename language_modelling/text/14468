"'''Just Dance'''" is a [[dance-pop]] song recorded by American [[Pop music|pop]] singer [[Lady Gaga]]. The song is written by Gaga and features labelmate [[Colby O'Donis]], additional vocals by [[Akon]] and was produced by [[RedOne]]. It was released as the [[lead single]] from Gaga's [[debut album]], ''[[The Fame (album)|The Fame]]'' in 2008. The song was written by Gaga in ten minutes as "a happy record". An uptempo dance song, "Just Dance" also has influences of R&B and lyrically speaks about being [[intoxication|intoxicated]] at a house party.<ref name="songfacts"/> 

The song has been critically appreciated with reviewers complimenting its club anthem-like nature and the synth pop associated with it. The song has also achieved commercial success by topping charts in the United States, Australia, Canada, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, as well as reaching the top ten in many other countries. In the United States, "Just Dance" was a [[sleeper hit]], spending almost five months on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] before finally reaching the summit of the chart in January of 2009.<ref name="aces">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7978791.stm|title=Lady GaGa draws aces on US charts|date=2009-04-02|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-05-03}}</ref> It scored the third-biggest single-week sum of all time selling 419,000 downloads in just one week.<ref name="download"/>

==Writing and inspiration==
[[File:Justdancesheet.JPG|250px|right|thumb|"Just Dance" sheet music showing the chord progression and beat rate.]]
"Just Dance" is written by Gaga and [[Akon]] with co-writing by [[RedOne]] who also produced the track. In an interview with ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' Gaga explained her inspiration for writing the song. She said,
<blockquote>
"I was very hungover. I wrote the song in about 10 minutes with [producer] RedOne. And it was my first time being in a Hollywood studio. Very pristine, big huge room with giant speakers."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/people/story/986150.html|title=There's more to Lady GaGa than irresistible beats|last=Town|first=Coming|date=April 6, 2009|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|publisher=Miami Herald Publishing Company|accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref>

Gaga wrote "Just Dance" during January 2007 and according to her it was "hard work and a lot of people didnt believe in it at first".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/lady-gaga/news/91020-lady-gaga-interview|title=Lady GaGa Interview|last=Madsen|first=Ben|date=January 15, 2009|work=[[MTV]]|publisher=[[MTV Networks Entertainment Group]]|accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref> In an interview with [[Contactmusic.com]] Gaga explained that "Just Dance" is a happy record and is supposed to be appreciated by people going through rough times like losing jobs and homes etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/gaga%20i%20wrote%20hit%20in%2010%20minutes_1100865|title='I wrote hit in 10 minutes'|first=Contactmusic |last=Press|date=April 17, 2009|work=[[Contactmusic.com]]|publisher=Contact Music Ltd.|accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref> Gaga further explained with [[Artistdirect.com]] that she wanted to write a beautiful record with "Just Dance". Being asked the reason for which "Just Dance" has become popular, Gaga said that she thought "everyone is looking for a song that really speaks to the joy in our souls and in our hearts and having a good time. It's just one of those records. It feels really good, and when you listen to it, it makes you feel good inside. It's as simple as that. I don't think it's rocket science when it comes to the heart. I think it's a heart theme song."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/news/article/0,,4931544,00.html|title=Interview: Lady Gaga|date=January 30, 2009|accessdate=2009-04-27|work=[[Artistdirect.com]]|publisher=[[ARTISTdirect, Inc.]]}}</ref>

She said,
<blockquote>
"Oh it was so fun, it was amazing. For me it was like being on a [[Martin Scorsese]] set. I've been so low budget for so long, and to have this incredibly amazing video was really very humbling. It was really fun, but you'll see if you ever come to a video shoot of mine one day <U+2013> I'm very private about those things, I don't really talk to everybody. I'm not like the party girl running around. I might even seem to be a bit of a diva. I'm sort of with myself, in my work head space worrying about costumes, and if extras look right, and placement. I don't just show up for things, you know. That video was a vision of mine. It was Melina the director who wanted to do something, to have a performance art aspect that was so pop but it was still commercial, but that felt like lifestyle. It was all those things, I love it."<ref name="aboutmusic">{{cite web|url=http://dancemusic.about.com/od/artistshomepages/a/LadyGagaInt.htm|title=Interview with Lady Gaga|last=Slomowicz|first=DJ Ron|date=June 10, 2008|work=[[About.com]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref>

Ltd}}</ref> In Australia she performed on [[Sunrise (TV program)|Sunrise]]. Her performance caused controversy because of allegations that she was [[lip-synching]]). Gaga denied it and released a statement, saying:
<blockquote>I was sick the day of the show but I absolutely, 100 per cent, was singing live. [...]  have never lip-synched and never will. Even on my worst day, I never will.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,,24420389-5013560,00.html|title=Lady Gaga denies lip-synching on Channel 7's Sunrise|date=September 30, 2008|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=News.com.au|accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref></blockquote> She also performed it during her [[AOL]] sessions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interscope.com/artist/player/default.aspx?mid=4596&aid=599|title=Lady Gaga - Just Dance AOL Sessions|work=[[Interscope Records]]|publisher=www.interscope.com|accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref> "Just Dance" was added to the setlist of her first headlining [[The Fame Ball Tour]] where it was performed as the final song before the Encore. Gaga wore a dress made of plastic bubbles. As the performance for the acoustic version of "Poker Face" ended, Gaga exited from the stage and a video interlude called "The Face" starts telling about Gaga's alternate persona Candy Warhol and teaching her to speak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2009/mar/26/entertainment/chi-0326-lady-gaga-ovnmar26|title=Lady GaGa delights|last=Downing |first=Andy|date=March 26, 2009|work=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=tribune.com|accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref> As the video nears the end Gaga appears on the stage wearing a [[tutu]] shaped dress with plates on shoulders. The backdrop changes to show blinking disco lights and Gaga stands while wearing her video sunglasses which display the line "Pop Music Will Never Be Low Brow". A remix of the [[Introduction (music)|intro]] for "Just Dance" starts and Gaga starts singing it while moving around in choreographed dance moves as she is joined by her dancers on stage. During the "I'm psychotic, synch-hypnotic" interlude, Gaga brings out her trademark  disco-stick again. The performance ends with Gaga and her dancers taking a bow in front of the stage and exiting with her DJ [[Space Cowboy (musician)|Space Cowboy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1161705/Bubble-wrap-Lady-GaGa-swaps-leotard-clear-plastic-dreamcoat.html?ITO=1490|title=Bubble wrap!
