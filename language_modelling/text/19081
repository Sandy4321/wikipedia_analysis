The {{Nihongo|'''''Yamato'' class battleships'''|<U+5927><U+548C><U+578B><U+6226><U+8266>|Yamato-gata senkan}} were [[battleship]]s of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) constructed and operated during [[World War II]].  Displacing {{convert|72000|LT|MT}} at full-load, the vessels of the class were the largest, heaviest, and most heavily-armed battleships ever constructed.  The class carried the largest [[naval artillery]] ever fitted to a warship, nine [[40 cm/45 Type 94|{{convert|460|mm|in|1|adj=on}} naval guns]], each capable of firing {{convert|2998|lb|kg|adj=on}} shells over {{convert|26|mi|km}}.  Two battleships of the class ({{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}}) were completed, while a third<U+2014>''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Shinano|Shinano]]''<U+2014>was converted to an [[aircraft carrier]] during construction.

Due to the threat of American submarines and aircraft carriers, both ''Yamato'' and ''Musashi'' spent the majority of their careers in naval bases at [[Brunei]], [[Truk]], and [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]]&mdash;deploying on several occasions in response to American raids on Japanese bases&mdash;before participating in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], as part of Admiral Kurita's Centre Force.  ''Musashi'' was sunk during the course of the battle by American carrier airplanes. ''Shinano'' was sunk ten days after her commissioning in November 1944 by the submarine {{USS|Archer-Fish|SS-311|6}}, while ''Yamato'' was sunk in April 1945 during [[Operation Ten-Go]].

On the eve of the Allies' [[occupation of Japan]], special service officers of the Imperial Japanese Navy destroyed virtually all records, drawings, and photographs of or relating to the ''Yamato''-class battleships, leaving only fragmentary records of the design characteristics and other technical matters. The destruction of these documents was so efficient that until 1948 the only known images of the ''Yamato'' and ''Musashi'' were those taken by [[United States Navy]] aircraft involved in the attacks on the two battleships. Although some additional photographs and information from documents that were not destroyed have come to light over the years, the loss the majority of written records for the class has made extensive research into the ''Yamato'' class somewhat difficult.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Muir | first = Micheal | title = Rearming in a Vacuum: United States Navy Intelligence and the Japanese Capital Ship Threat, 1936<U+2013>1945 | journal = The Journal of Military History | volume = 54 | issue = 4 | year = 1990 | month = October | page = 485 | publisher = Society for Military History | issn = 1543-7795 | oclc = 37032245  | url = http://www.jstor.org/pss/1986067#journalInfo | format = [[JSTOR]] access required | accessdate = 7 March 2008 }}</ref><ref>Skulski, p. 8</ref>  Because of the lack of written records, information on the class largely came from interviews of Japanese officers following Japan's surrender.<ref> {{cite news|title = Warships of the World | work = The Times | date = November 5, 1948 | page = 2D}}</ref>

==Design==
The design of the ''Yamato'' class battleships was shaped by expansionist movements within the Japanese government, Japanese industrial power, and the need for a fleet powerful enough to intimidate likely adversaries.<ref name=johnston123/>

[[Image:Musashi1944.png|thumb|left|Artist's drawing of ''Musashi'' showing her appearance in October 1944]]
In the 1930s, the Japanese government began a shift towards [[ultranationalist]] militancy.<ref>Willmott, p. 32</ref>  This movement called for the expansion of the [[Japanese Empire]] to include the entirety of the [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[Southeast Asia]].  The maintenance of such an empire<U+2014>spanning {{convert|3000|mi|km}} from [[China]] to [[Midway Atoll|Midway Island]]<U+2014>stipulated a sizable fleet capable of sustaining  control of Japanese territory.<ref>Schom, p. 42</ref> Although all of Japan's battleships built prior to the ''Yamato'' class had been completed before 1921, all were either reconstructed or significantly modernized, or both, in the 1930s.<ref>Willmott, p. 34; Gardiner and Gray, p. 229</ref> This allowed<U+2014>among other things<U+2014>additional speed and firepower, which the Japanese intended to use to conquer and maintain their aspired-to empire.<ref>Gardiner and Gray, pp. 229<U+2013>231, 234</ref>  When Japan withdrew from the [[London Naval Treaty]] in 1934, it no longer had to design battleships within the limitations of the treaties, and was therefore free to build warships larger than those the other major maritime powers.<ref>Willmott, p. 35</ref>

As Japan's need to maintain resource-producing colonies led to the possibility of confrontation with the United States,<ref>Schom, p. 43</ref> the U.S. became Japan's primary potential enemy. However, the U.S. possessed significantly greater industrial power than Japan, with 32.2% of worldwide industrial production compared to Japan's 3.5% of worldwide production.<ref>Willmott, p. 22</ref> Furthermore, several leading members of the [[United States Congress]] had pledged "to outbuild Japan three to one in a naval race."<ref> {{cite news|title = Fear is the Real Cause of Navy Treaty End | first = Elliott | last = Thurston | date = January 2, 1935 | work = The Washington Post | page = 7}}</ref> As such, Japanese industrial power could never hope to compete with American industrial ability,<ref name=johnston123/> so design requirements stipulated that the new battleships be individually superior to their counterparts in the [[United States Navy]].<ref>Garzke and Dulin, p. 45</ref>  Each of these planned battleships would be capable of engaging multiple enemy capital ships simultaneously, eliminating the need to expend as much industrial effort as the U.S. on battleship construction.<ref name=johnston123/>  Many in Japan's Naval and Military Command hoped these vessels would intimidate the United States into appeasing Japanese aggression in the Pacific.<ref>Willmott, p. 45</ref>

Preliminary studies for a new class of battleships began after Japan's departure from the [[League of Nations]] and its renunciation of the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington]] and [[London Naval Treaty|London]] naval treaties; from 1934 to 1936, 24 initial designs were put forth. These early plans varied greatly in armament, propulsion, endurance, and armor. [[Main battery|Main batteries]] fluctuated between {{convert|460|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|410|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns, while the secondary armaments were composed of differing numbers of {{convert|155|mm|in|abbr=on}}, {{convert|127|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns. Propulsion in most of the designs was a hybrid [[diesel engine|diesel]]-[[steam turbine|turbine]] combination, though one relied solely on diesel and another planned for only turbines. Endurance in the designs had, at {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}, a low of {{convert|6000|nmi|km|abbr=on}} in design A-140-J<sub>2</sub> to a high of {{convert|9200|nmi|km|abbr=on}} in designs A-140A and A-140-B<sub>2</sub>. Armor varied between providing protection from the fire of 410&nbsp;mm guns to enough protection against 460&nbsp;mm guns.<ref>Garzke and Dulin, pp. 45&ndash;51</ref>

After these had been reviewed, two of the original twenty-four were finalized as possibilities, A-140-F<sub>3</sub> and A-140-F<sub>4</sub>. Differing mainly in their range ({{convert|4900|nmi|km|abbr=on}} versus {{convert|7200|nmi|km|abbr=on}} at {{convert|16|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}), they were used in the formation of the final preliminary study, which was finished on 20 July 1936. Tweaks to that design resulted in the definitive design of March 1937,<ref name=Garzke49-50>Garzke and Dulin, pp. 49&ndash;50</ref> which was put forth by Rear-Admiral [[Fukuda Keiji]];<ref name=cfrecord>{{cite web | last1 = Hackett | first1 = Robert | last2 = Kingsepp | first2 = Sander | title = IJN YAMATO: Tabular Record of Movement | url = http://combinedfleet.com/yamato.htm | work = Combined Fleet | publisher = CombinedFleet.com | date = 6 June 2006 | accessdate = 8 January 2009}}</ref> an endurance of 7,200&nbsp;nm was finally decided upon, and the hybrid diesel-turbine propulsion was abandoned in favor of just turbines. The diesels were removed from the design because of problems with the engines aboard the {{Sclass|Taigei|submarine tender}}s.<ref name=Garzke49-50/> Their engines, which were similar to the ones that were going to be mounted in the new battleships, required a "major repair and maintenance effort"<ref name=Garzke49>Garzke and Dulin, p. 49</ref> to keep them running due to a "fundamental design defect".<ref name=Garzke49/> In addition, if the engines failed entirely, the {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}} armor that protected that area would severely hamper any attempt to replace them.<ref>Garzke and Dulin, p. 50</ref>

The final design called for a standard displacement of {{convert|64000|LT|t}} and a full-load displacement of {{convert|69988|LT|t}},<ref name=Garzke53>Garzke and Dulin, p. 53</ref> making the ships of the class the largest battleships yet designed, and the largest battleships ever constructed.  The design called for a main armament of nine {{convert|460|mm|in|1|adj=on}} [[naval guns]], mounted in three triple-turrets<U+2014>each of which weighed more than a 1930's-era destroyer.<ref name=cfrecord/>  The designs were quickly approved by Japanese Naval high command,<ref name=johnston122>Johnston and McAuley, p. 122</ref> over the objections of naval aviators, who argued for the construction of carriers rather than battleships.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 5<U+2013>6</ref><ref group=A>Even as far back as 1933, Imperial Japanese Navy aviators, including Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], argued that the best defense against U.S. carrier attacks would be a carrier fleet of their own, not a battleship fleet. However, "when controversy broke into the open, the older, conservative admirals held firm to their traditional faith in the battleship as the capital ship of the fleet by supporting the construction of the ... ''Yamato''-class superbattleships." See: Reynolds, pp. 5<U+2013>6</ref> In all, five ''Yamato''-class battleships were planned.<ref name=johnston123/>

Although five ''Yamato'' class vessels had been planned in 1937, only three<U+2014>two battleships and an aircraft carrier<U+2014>were ever completed.  Due to dwindling naval resources, the hull of the fourth vessel, only about 30% complete, was taken apart and scrapped in 1942; materials from this were used in the conversions of {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Ise||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Hy<U+016B>ga||2}} to hybrid [[Ise class battleship#Conversion to aircraft carriers|battleship/aircraft carriers]].<ref>Garzke and Dulin, p. 84</ref><ref name=Johnston124>Johnston and McAuley, p. 124</ref><ref group=A>Although the hull was scrapped, the double bottom was not; later construction of "four large submarines" took place on top of it. See: Garzke and Dulin, p. 84. Available sources do not report when the double bottom was scrapped.</ref> The fifth vessel was never laid down.<ref name=Johnston124/>  All three vessels were built in extreme secrecy, as to prevent American intelligence officials from learning of their existence and specifications;<ref name=johnston123/> indeed, the United States' [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] only became aware of ''Yamato'' and ''Musashi'' by name in late 1942. At this early time, their assumptions on the class' specifications were quite far off; while they were correct on their length, the class was given as having a beam of {{convert|110|ft|m}} (in actuality, it was about {{convert|127|ft|m}}) and a displacement of 40,000<U+2013>57,000 tons (in actuality, 69,000&nbsp;tons). In addition, the main armament of ''Yamato'' class was given as nine {{convert|16|in|cm|adj=on}} guns as late as July 1945<U+2014>four months after ''Yamato'' was sunk.<ref>Friedman, p. 308</ref><ref name=Johnston128>Johnston and McAuley, p. 128</ref> Both ''[[Jane's Fighting Ships]]'' and the Western media also misreported the specifications of the ships.  In September 1944, ''Jane's Fighting Ships'' listed the displacement of both the ''Yamato'' and the ''Musashi'' as 45,000 tons.<ref> {{cite news|title = U.S. Navy Outnumbers Jap 10 to 1 | work = The Washington Post | first = Richard | last = Tobin | date = October 1, 1944 | page = B1}} </ref> Similarly, both the ''[[New York Times]]'' and the [[Associated Press]] reported that the two ships displaced 45,000 tons with a speed of 30 knots,<ref> {{cite news|title = 4 Carriers Sunk | work = The New York Times | first = George | last = Horneby | date = October 30, 1944 | page = 1}} </ref> and even after the sinking of the ''Yamato'' in April 1945, ''[[The Times]]'' of London continued to give 45,000 tons as the ship's displacement.<ref> {{cite news|title = Japan's Biggest Warship Sunk |work = The Times | date = April 9, 1945 | page = 3C}} </ref> Nevertheless, the existence of the ships&mdash;and their supposed specifications&mdash;heavily influenced American naval engineers in the design of the [[Montana class battleship]]s, all four of which were to be built to counter the firepower of the ''Yamato'' class.<ref>W.

Even though they comprised 40% of the total main ammunition load by 1944,<ref name="navweaps 18.1"/> ''3 Shiki ts<U+00FB>j<U+00F4>dan'' were rarely used in combat against enemy aircraft due to the severe damage the firing of these shells inflicted on the barrels of the main guns;<ref name=steinberg54/> indeed, one of the shells may have exploded early and disabled one of ''Musashi''{{'}}s guns during the [[Battle of the Sibuyan Sea]].<ref name="navweaps 18.1"/>  The shells were intended to put up a [[barrage]] of flame that any aircraft attempting to attack would have to navigate through.  However, U.S. pilots considered these shells to be more of a pyrotechnics display than a competent anti-aircraft weapon.<ref name="navweaps 18.1"/>

In the original design, the ''Yamato'' class' secondary armament comprised twelve {{convert|6.1|in|cm|adj=on}} guns mounted in four triple turrets (one forward, one aft, two midships),<ref name=jackson75/> and twelve {{convert|5|in|cm|adj=on}} guns in six double-turrets (three on each side amidships).<ref name=jackson75/>  In addition, the ''Yamato'' class originally carried twenty-four {{convert|1|in|cm|adj=on}} anti-aircraft guns, primarily mounted amidships.<ref name=jackson75/>  In 1944, ''Yamato''<U+2014>the sole remaining member of the class<U+2014>underwent significant anti-aircraft upgrades, with the configuration of secondary armament changed to six {{convert|6.1|in|cm|adj=on}} guns,<ref name=johnston180>Johnston and McAuley, p. 180</ref> twenty-four {{convert|5|in|cm|adj=on}} guns,<ref name=johnston180/> and one hundred and sixty-two {{convert|1|in|cm|adj=on}} antiaircraft guns,<ref name=johnston180/> in preparation for operations in Leyte Gulf.<ref name="jackson128"/>

The armament on ''Shinano'' was quite different from that of her sister vessels due to her conversion. As the carrier was designed for a support role, significant antiaircraft weaponry was installed on the vessel: sixteen {{convert|5|in|cm|adj=on}} guns,<ref name=cfshinano>{{cite web | last1 = Tully | first1 = Anthony P. | title = Shinano | url = http://combinedfleet.com/ship.php?q=shinan_c.htm | work = Combined Fleet | publisher = CombinedFleet.com | accessdate = 13 January 2009}}</ref> one hundred twenty-five {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=on}} antiaircraft guns,<ref name=cfshinano/> and three hundred thirty-six {{convert|5|in|cm|adj=on}} antiaircraft rocket launchers in twelve twenty-eight barrel turrets.<ref name=preston84>Preston, p. 84</ref>  None of these guns were ever used against an enemy vessel or aircraft.<ref name=preston84/>

===Armour===
Both battleships of the ''Yamato'' class were designed to be capable of engaging multiple enemy battleships,<ref name="Schom, p. 270">Schom, p. 270</ref> and as such were fitted with significant quantities of armour plating. The main belt of armour along the side of the vessel was {{convert|410|mm|in}} thick,<ref name=johnston123/> with additional bulkheads {{convert|355|mm|in}} thick beyond the main-belt.<ref name=johnston123/> The armour on the main-turrets surpassed even that of the main-belt, with plating {{convert|650|mm|in}} thick.<ref name=johnston123/> Armor plates in both the main belt and main turrets was made of Vickers Hardened, which was a face-hardened steel armor.<ref name=Garzke96>Garzke and Dulin, p. 65</ref> Deck armour&mdash;{{convert|75|mm|in}} thick&mdash;was composed of a nickel-chromium-molybdenum alloy. Ballistics tests at the proving ground at Kamegabuki demonstrated the deck alloy to be superior to the homogeneous Vickers plates by 10&ndash;15%.<ref name=Garzke96/> Additional plating was designed by manipulating the chromium and nickel composition of the alloy. Higher contents of nickel allowed the plate to be rolled and bent without developing fracture properties.<ref name=Garzke96/>

The relatively new procedure of [[arc welding]] was used extensively throughout the ship, strengthening the durability of the armour plating.<ref name=fitzsimons2609>Fitzsimons, Volume 24, p. 2609</ref> Through this technique, the lower-side [[belt armour]], included in the ships as a response to gunnery experiments upon [[Tosa class battleship|''Tosa'']] and the new Japanese Type 91 shell which could travel great lengths underwater,<ref name=Garzke94>Garzke and Dulin, p. 94</ref> was used to strengthen the hull structure of the entire vessel.<ref name=fitzsimons2609/> In total, the vessels of the ''Yamato'' class contained 1,147 watertight compartments,<ref name=fitzsimons2609/> of which 1,065 were beneath the armoured deck.<ref name=fitzsimons2609/>

However, the armour of the ''Yamato'' class still suffered from several shortfalls<U+2014>many of which would prove fatal in 1944<U+2013>45.<ref name=underwaterarmour>{{cite web | title = Best Battleship: Underwater Protection | url = http://www.combinedfleet.com/b_underw.htm | work = Combined Fleet | publisher = CombinedFleet.com | accessdate = 25 October 2008}}</ref> In particular, poor jointing between the upper-belt and lower-belt armour created a weak-point just below the waterline, causing the class to be susceptible to air-dropped torpedoes.<ref name=steinberg54/> Other structural weaknesses existed near the bow of the vessels, where the armour plating was generally thinner.<ref name=steinberg54>Steinberg, p. 54</ref> The hull of the ''Shinano'' was subject to even greater structural weaknesses, having been equipped with minimal armour and no watertight compartments at the time of her sinking.<ref name=cfshinano/>

===Propulsion===
The ''Yamato'' class was fitted with 12 Kanpon Boilers, which powered quadruple steam turbines.<ref name=jackson74>Jackson, p. 74</ref>  These, in turn, drove four {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=on}} propellers.  This powerplant enabled the ''Yamato'' class to achieve a top speed of {{convert|27|knots|km/h}}.<ref name=johnston123/>  With an indicated horsepower of 147,948 ({{convert|147948|ihp|kW|disp=output only|abbr=on}}),<ref name=johnston123/> the ''Yamato'' class' ability to function alongside fast carriers was limited.  In addition, the fuel consumption rate of both battleships was very high.<ref name=jackson128>Jackson, p. 128</ref>  As a result, neither battleship was used in combat during the [[Solomon Islands Campaign]] or the minor battles during the "island hopping" period of 1943 and early 1944.<ref name=jackson128/>  The propulsion system of the ''Shinano'' was slightly improved, allowing the carrier to achieve a top speed of {{convert|28|knots|km/h}}.<ref name=preston84/>

=="Super Yamato" class battleships==
{{main|Design A-150 battleship}}
Two battleships of an entirely new, and larger, design were planned as a part of the 1942 fleet replenishment program. Designated as Design A-150 and initially named Warship Number 178 and Warship Number 179, plans for the ships began soon after the design of the ''Yamato'' class was finished, probably in 1938<U+2013>39. Everything was "essentially completed" sometime in 1941, but with war on the horizon, work on the battleships was halted to fill a need for additional warships, like aircraft carriers and cruisers. The Japanese loss in the [[Battle of Midway]], where four fleet carriers were sunk (out of six in the entire navy), made it certain that work on the ships would never begin. In the third volume of their ''Battleships'' series, ''Axis and Neutral Battleships in World War II'', the authors William H. Garzke and Robert O. Dulin asserted that these ships would have been the "most powerful battleships in history" because of their massive {{convert|500|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[main battery]] and extensive anti-aircraft weaponry.<ref name="Conway's">Gardiner and Chesneau, p. 178</ref><ref name=Garzke>Garzake and Dulin, pp. 85<U+2013>86</ref>

Similar to the fate of papers relating to the ''Yamato'' class, most papers and all plans relating to the class were destroyed in the confusion at the end of the war. It is known that the final design of the ships would have had an even greater fire power and size than the ''Yamato'' class&mdash;a main battery of six {{convert|500|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns in three twin turrets and secondary anti-aircraft armament consisting of "many" {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns. The [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] was to be about the same as the ''Yamato''{{'}}s, while a side [[Belt armor|armor belt]] of {{convert|460|mm|in|abbr=on}} was planned.<ref name="Conway's"/><ref name=Garzke/>

==Cultural significance==
[[File:YAMATO<U+3000>Moder.JPG|thumb| Visitors to the 'Yamato Museum' examine the museum's 1:10 scale model of the battleship in 2006]]
From the time of their construction until the present day, ''Yamato'' and ''Musashi'' have carried a notable presence in Japanese culture, ''Yamato'' in particular.  Upon completion, the battleships represented the epitome of Imperial Japanese naval engineering.  In addition, the two ships, due to their size, speed, and power, visibly embodied Japan's determination and readiness to defend its interests against the western powers, especially the United States.  [[Shigeru Fukudome]], chief of the Operations Section of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff]], described the two ships as "symbols of naval power that provided to officers and men alike a profound sense of confidence in their navy."<ref>Evans and Peattie, pp. 298, 378</ref>

''Yamato'', and especially the story of her sinking, has appeared often in Japanese popular culture, such as the [[anime]] ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' and the 2005 film [[Yamato (film)|''Yamato'']].<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>  The appearances in popular culture usually portray the ship's last mission as a brave, selfless, but futile, symbolic effort by the participating Japanese sailors to defend their homeland.  One of the reasons that the warship may have such significance in Japanese culture is that the word "[[Yamato]]" was often used as a poetic name for Japan. Thus, the end of battleship ''Yamato'' could serve as a metaphor for the end of the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese empire]].<ref>Yoshida and Minear, p. xvii; Evans and Peattie, p. 378</ref><ref>Skulski, p. 7</ref>
