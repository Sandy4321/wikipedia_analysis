The {{nihongo|'''''Shikishima'' class'''|<U+6577><U+5CF6><U+578B><U+6226><U+8266>|Shikishima-gata senkan}} was a two-ship [[ship class|class]] of [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] in the late 1890s. As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself, they were designed and built in the UK. The ships participated in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904<U+2013>1905, including the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] on the second day of the war. ''Hatsuse'' sank after striking two [[naval mine|mines]] off [[L<U+00FC>shunkou District|Port Arthur]] in May 1904. ''Shikishima'' fought in the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea|Battles of the Yellow Sea]] and [[Battle of Tsushima|Tsushima]] and was lightly damaged in the latter action, although shells prematurely exploded in her main armament in each battle. The ship was reclassified as a [[coastal defence ship]] in 1921 and served as a [[training ship]] for the rest of her career. She was disarmed and [[hulk (ship)|hulk]]ed in 1923 and finally [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap in 1948.

==Design and description==
Combat experience in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the [[Jeune Ecole]] naval philosophy, and Japan embarked on a program to modernize and expand its fleet. As with the earlier [[Fuji class battleship|''Fuji''-class battleships]], Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships, and turned again to the [[United Kingdom]]. They were ordered as part of the Ten Year Naval Expansion Programme and paid for from the <U+00A3>30,000,000 [[indemnity]] paid by China after losing the [[Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895)|Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894<U+2013>1895.<ref name=b5>Brook 1999, p. 125</ref>

[[File:Shikishimas.png|thumb|left|300px|<center>Left elevation and deck plan as depicted in Jane's Fighting Ships 1906</center>]]
The design of the ''Shikishima'' class was a modified and improved version of the {{sclass|Majestic|battleship}}s of the [[Royal Navy]]. They had the same armament and similar machinery as the ''Fuji'' class which was intended to allow them to work together as a homogenous group.<ref name=ck1/> The ''Shikishima''-class ships had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|412|ft|m|1}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|75.5|-|76.75|ft|m|1}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|26.25|-|26.5|ft|m|1}}. They displaced {{convert|14850|-|15000|LT|t|lk=in}} at normal load.<ref name=b5/> The hull had a [[double bottom]] and was subdivided into 261 watertight compartments.<ref name=ck1/> The crew numbered about 741 officers and enlisted men,<ref name=j7>Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 17</ref> although this increased to 849 when serving as a [[flagship]].<ref name=b5/>

===Propulsion===
The ships were powered by two [[Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes|Humphrys Tennant]] [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]], each driving one propeller, using steam generated by 25 [[Belleville boiler]]s. The engines were rated at {{convert|14500|ihp|lk=in}}, using [[forced draught]], and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|18|kn}}<ref name=b5/> although they proved to be faster during their [[sea trial]]s. ''Shikishima'' reached a top speed of {{convert|19.027|kn}} using {{convert|14667|ihp}}.<ref name=j8>Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 18</ref> The ships carried a maximum of {{convert|1643|t|LT}}<ref name=b5/> of coal which allowed them to steam for {{convert|5000|lk=in|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref name=j7/>

===Armament===
[[File:Shikishima class 12 inch gun turret right elevation.jpg|thumb|left|300px|<center>Right elevation of 12 inch gun turret & ammunition hoists</center>]]
The [[main battery]] of the ''Shikishima'' class consisted of the same four [[Armstrong Whitworth|Elswick Ordnance Company]] 40-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[Armstrong Whitworth 12 inch naval gun|twelve-inch guns]] as used in the ''Fuji'' class. They were mounted in twin-gun [[barbette]]s fore and aft of the superstructure that had armoured hoods to protect the guns and were usually called gun turrets. The hydraulically powered mountings could be loaded at all angles of traverse while the guns were loaded at a fixed angle of +13.5<U+00B0>.<ref name=b6>Brook 1999, p. 126</ref> They fired {{convert|850|lb|kg|adj=on|0}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2400|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.<ref>Friedman, pp. 270<U+2013>71</ref>

[[Battleship secondary armament|Secondary armament]] of the ''Shikishima'' class consisted of fourteen 40-calibre [[Type 41 6-inch (152 mm)/40-caliber naval gun|Type 41 six-inch]] [[British_ordnance_terms#QF|quick-firing guns]] mounted in [[casemate]]s. Eight of these guns were positioned on the main deck on the side of the ship's hull and the other six guns were placed in the superstructure.<ref>Brook 1985, p. 278</ref> They fired {{convert|100|lb|kg|adj=on|0}} shells at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2300|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.<ref>Friedman, pp. 275<U+2013>76</ref> Protection against [[torpedo boat]] attacks was provided by twenty [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|QF 12-pounder 12 cwt]]<ref group=Note>"cwt" is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.</ref> guns and four {{convert|47|mm|adj=on}} 2.5-pounder [[Hotchkiss gun]]s.<ref name=b5/> The 12-pounders fired {{convert|3|in|adj=on|0}}, {{convert|12.5|lb|adj=on}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2359|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.<ref>Friedman, p. 114</ref> The ships also equipped with four submerged [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch]] [[torpedo tube]]s, two on each [[broadside]].<ref name=b5/>

===Armour===
The [[waterline]] [[armor belt|main belt]] of the ''Shikishima''-class vessels consisted of [[Harvey armour]] {{convert|8|ft|m|1}} high, {{convert|3|ft|7|in|m|1}} of which was above the waterline at normal load, and had a maximum thickness of {{convert|9|in|mm|0}} for the middle {{convert|220|ft|m}} of the ship. It was only {{convert|4|in|mm|0}} inches thick at the ends of the ship and was surmounted by a six-inch [[strake]] of armor that ran between the barbettes for 220 feet. The barbettes were {{convert|14|in|mm|0}} thick, but reduced to {{convert|10|in|mm|0}} at the level of the lower deck. The armour of the barbette hoods had a maximum thickness of {{convert|10|in|mm|0}} while their roofs were three inches thick. Diagonal [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s {{convert|12|-|14|in|mm|0}} thick connected the barbettes to the side armor, but the bulkheads were only six inches thick at the lower deck level. The casemates protecting the secondary armament were also six inches thick. The flat portion of the [[Deck (ship)|deck]] armour was {{convert|2.5|in|mm|0}} thick and four inches thick<ref name>Brook 1999, pp. 125<U+2013>26</ref> where it sloped down to the bottom of the armour belt. This significantly improved the ships' protection as any shell that penetrated their vertical armour also had to penetrate the sloping deck before it could reach the machinery compartments or [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s.<ref name=ck1/> Outside the central armoured citadel, the sloped deck had a thickness of {{convert|2|in|mm|0}}. The forward [[conning tower]] was protected by 14 inches of armour, but the aft conning tower only had three inches of armour.<ref name=b5/>

At the start of the Russo-Japanese War, ''Hatsuse'' and ''Shikishima'' were assigned to the 1st Division of the [[1st Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|1st Fleet]]. They participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904 when Admiral [[T<U+014D>g<U+014D> Heihachir<U+014D>]] led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Squadron]] anchored just outside of [[L<U+00FC>shunkou District|Port Arthur]]. T<U+014D>g<U+014D> chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the Russian ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a bad idea as the Japanese {{convert|8|in|0|adj=on}} and six-inch guns inflicted very little damage on the Russian ships who concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. ''Hatsuse'' was hit twice during the battle, 10 men being killed and 17 wounded, but ''Shikishima'' was only hit once with 17 men wounded.<ref>Forczyk, pp. 41<U+2013>44</ref>

Both ships participated in the action of 13 April when T<U+014D>g<U+014D> successfully lured out two battleships of the Pacific Squadron. When the Russians spotted the five battleships of the 1st Division, they turned back for Port Arthur and the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Petropavlovsk|1897|2}} struck a minefield laid by the Japanese the previous night. It sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded. Emboldened by his success, T<U+014D>g<U+014D> resumed long-range bombardment missions, which prompted the Russians to lay more minefields.<ref>Forczyk, pp. 45<U+2013>46</ref>

On 14 May 1904, ''Hatsuse'', ''Shikishima'', and the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yashima||2}}, the [[protected cruiser]] [[Japanese cruiser Kasagi|''Kasagi'']], and the [[dispatch boat]] {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Tatsuta|1894|2}} put to sea to relieve the Japanese blockading force off Port Arthur.<ref>Warner & Warner, p. 279</ref> On the following morning, the squadron encountered a newly laid Russian minefield. ''Hatsuse'' struck one mine that disabled her steering and ''Yashima'' struck another when moving to assist ''Hatsuse''.<ref name=f6>Forczyk, p. 46</ref> ''Hatsuse'' struck another mine while drifting about a half hour later that detonated one of her magazines and the ship sank in a little over a minute.<ref>Warner & Warner, pp. 279<U+2013>82</ref> The catastrophe claimed 496 crewmen although the escorting ships were able to rescue 336 men.<ref name=f6/>

''Shikishima'' was not hit during the Battle of the Yellow Sea in August 1904, although a shell exploded prematurely in one of her 12-inch guns, disabling it.<ref>Forczyk, pp. 51<U+2013>52</ref> During the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905, she was hit nine times; the most serious of which penetrated beneath a six-inch gun, killing or wounding the entire gun crew. Again the ship had another 12-inch shell prematurely detonate in one of the forward guns, wrecking it completely.<ref>Campbell, p. 263</ref> ''Shikishima'' was reclassified as a first-class coast defence ship in September 1921,<ref name=ck1>Chesneau and Kolesnik, p. 221</ref> and was used for training duties in various capacities until disarmed and reclassified as a transport in 1923. Her hulk continued to be used as a training ship until she was scrapped in 1948.<ref name=s7/>
