'''Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez'''{{refn|group=note|This name uses [[Spanish naming customs]]; the first or paternal [[family name]] is ''Caro'' and the second or maternal family name is ''Mart<U+00ED>nez''.}} ({{IPA-es|xo<U+02C8>se ma<U+02C8><U+027E>ia 'ka<U+027E>o ma<U+027E>'tine<U+03B8>|-|Es-Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez.ogg}}; 1830 &ndash; November 1916) was a [[Chile]]an politician and [[civil servant]]. In May 1894, he was unanimously elected as the first [[Mayor of Pichilemu|mayor]] of the [[communes of Chile|commune]] of [[Pichilemu]], along with Pedro N. de Mira, and Francisco Reyes, who were respectively elected as ''segundo'' and ''tercer alcalde'' (second and third magistrate). Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez had previously served for several years as ''llavero'' (administrator) of the [[Hacienda San Antonio de Petrel|San Antonio de Petrel]] ''[[hacienda]]'', and between 1891 and 1892 was the Subdelegate of the 13th [[wikt:subdelegation|Subdelegation]] of [[San Fernando Department (Chile)|San Fernando Department]], which comprised the districts of [[C<U+00E1>huil]], Pe<U+00F1>ablanca, and Cocauqu<U+00E9>n.

The eleven-year mayorship of Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez, which lasted from 1894 and 1905, was qualified by journalist and local historian [[Jos<U+00E9> Arra<U+00F1>o Acevedo]] as "the most fruitful" in the history of the commune. In his four terms, Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez constructed roads that connected Pichilemu with [[San Fernando, Chile|San Fernando]], capital of the [[Administrative divisions of Chile#History|department]] of the same name, and founded several schools in Pichilemu and parts of current [[Marchig<U+00FC>e]].

He resigned in May 1905 and completed his fourth mayoral term as a ''[[regidor]]''. As a mayor, he was succeeded by [[Francisco Javier Asalgado]], who held the office for two non-consecutive terms. Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez was the father of [[Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Caro Rodr<U+00ED>guez]], the first Chilean [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and [[Francisco Caro Rodr<U+00ED>guez|Francisco Adriano Caro Rodr<U+00ED>guez]], who was ''regidor'' of Pichilemu for several terms between 1906 and December 1925, when he became the 8th Mayor of Pichilemu following the resignation of [[Luis Barahona Forn<U+00E9>s]].

==Early life==
Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez was born in [[San Antonio de Petrel]], in current [[Pichilemu]], [[Region of O'Higgins]], to Pedro Pascual Caro Gaete and Cayetana Mart<U+00ED>nez R<U+00ED>os, in 1830. The exact birth date is unknown, since all the books of the parish of [[Ciruelos]] with baptism records between 1830 and 1834 were burnt in a fire. The Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez family, of "devout Catholics", is described as having a "profound Christian faith," with their members "complying with unblemished devotion their Christian duties."<ref name="pastor1">{{cite book|title=Un pastor santo: el eminent<U+00ED>simo se<U+00F1>or cardenal don Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Caro Rodr<U+00ED>guez, 1866-1958|trans_title=A saint pastor: His Eminence Cardinal Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Caro Rodr<U+00ED>guez, 1866-1958|page=9-10|year=1981|publisher=Editorial Andr<U+00E9>s Bello|last=Salinas Fuenzalida|first=Augusto|location=Santiago, Chile|quote=Don Jos<U+00E9> Vicente Ort<U+00FA>zar escogi<U+00F3> para llavero de esa hacienda a don Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez, casado con la se<U+00F1>ora Rita Rodr<U+00ED>guez.

Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez and his family lived in the Petrel area until the 1880s, when they moved to nearby village [[Quebrada del Nuevo Reino]].<ref name="Arra<U+00F1>o1980">{{cite book |last1=Arra<U+00F1>o Acevedo |first1=Jos<U+00E9>|authorlink1=Jos<U+00E9> Arra<U+00F1>o Acevedo |editor1-first=Antonio |editor1-last=Sald<U+00ED>as|editor1-link=Antonio Sald<U+00ED>as |title=Pichilemu: mis fuentes de informaci<U+00F3>n |trans_title=Pichilemu: my information sources|publisher=Editora El Promaucae|location=Pichilemu, Chile |year=1990 |pages=138<U+2013>140 |chapter=Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez, Primer Alcalde de Pichilemu|trans_chapter=Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez, First Mayor of Pichilemu|origyear=First published 1980|language=Spanish}}</ref> Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez became an active member of the parish of Ciruelos.

==Political career==
Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez's first involvement in politics came in 1891, when he was appointed by [[President of Chile|President]] [[Jorge Montt|Jorge Montt <U+00C1>lvarez]] as [[wikt:subdelegate#Noun|subdelegate]] of the 13th Subdelegation of San Fernando Department, which included the districts of [[C<U+00E1>huil]], Pe<U+00F1>ablanca, and Cocauqu<U+00E9>n, territory of the current communes of Pichilemu, [[Marchig<U+00FC>e]], and [[Peralillo]]. He held the position until 1892, and was succeeded in the position by Jos<U+00E9> Domingo Fuenzalida.<ref name="arra"/>

Also in 1891, on 21 December, the commune of Pichilemu was created by the Autonomous Commune Law ({{lang-es|Ley de Comuna Aut<U+00F3>noma}}), written by [[Interior Ministry (Chile)|Ministry of the Interior]] Manuel Jos<U+00E9> Irarr<U+00E1>zabal Larra<U+00ED>n. The new commune comprised the whole territory of the 13th Subdelegation. It was one of the most extensive communes of the department of San Fernando. However, the local government was yet to be established.<ref name="arra"/>

On 21 March 1894, a preparatory meeting was held to create a ''{{lang|es|Junta Calificadora de Poderes}}''<ref name="prepa">{{cite book |editor1-first=Antonio |editor1-last=Sald<U+00ED>as|editor1-link=Antonio Sald<U+00ED>as |title=Pichilemu: mis fuentes de informaci<U+00F3>n|trans_title=Pichilemu: my information sources |publisher=Editora El Promaucae|location=Pichilemu, Chile |year=1990 |pages=137 |chapter=Acta de la Sesi<U+00F3>n Preparatoria, celebrada el 21 de marzo de 1894|trans_chapter=Minutes of the Preparatory Session, held on 21 March 1894|origyear=Taken from re-publication in ''[[Pichilemu (newspaper)|Pichilemu]]'' on 15 March 1944, pp. 3|language=Spanish}}</ref> &mdash;an organisation that would be in charge of the elections.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.cl/books?id=eQkNAAAAIAAJ|title=Bolet<U+00ED>n|trans_title=Bulletin|page=54|publisher=[[Chamber of Deputies of Chile]]|year=1867|location=Chile}}</ref> Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez was elected president of the ''{{lang|es|Junta Calificadora}}'' in the meeting.<ref name="prepa"/> Later that year, on 6 May, the first municipal meeting (''sesi<U+00F3>n municipal'') was held.

Immediately after his election, Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez created the local police force (''Cuerpo de Polic<U+00ED>a Local''). He also constructed roads all over the commune of Pichilemu, with special attention to those that would connect Pichilemu with the central area of the department of San Fernando, specifically the commune of San Fernando, and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], the capital of Chile. As part of this project, he constructed a bridge over the [[Petrel Lake]], currently known as ''{{lang|es|Puente Negro}}'' (Black Bridge), and another in C<U+00E1>huil, connecting that town with its saltworks. He also founded several schools in the Pichilemu area, which only had one, located in Ciruelos. Those include the schools of Yerbas Buenas, Las Garzas, Trinidad, Molineros, Pe<U+00F1>ablanca, all in the current territory of the commune of Marchig<U+00FC>e, and one in central Pichilemu.<ref name="Arra<U+00F1>o1980"/>

Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez was re-elected mayor (''primer alcalde'') of Pichilemu in 1897, 1900, and 1903. On 7 May 1905, just one year before his fourth term expired, he decided to resign to the ''primer alcalde'' office, and took a position as ''regidor'' of Pichilemu until 1906. Following his resignation, [[Francisco Javier Asalgado]] became the mayor, and held the office between that year and 1909, and again in 1912, but only for a month.<ref name="alcaldesregi"/>

His mayorship was described by historian Jos<U+00E9> Arra<U+00F1>o Acevedo as "the most fruitful [...] in the municipal life of Pichilemu." Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez was described by Virgilio Figueroa, biographer of his son [[Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Caro Rodr<U+00ED>guez]], as "an individual with public spirit and leadership skills."<ref name="Arra<U+00F1>o1980"/> According to [[Washington Sald<U+00ED>as]] in an article published in ''[[Pichilemu News]]'', Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez's mayorship is the longest in the history of Pichilemu.<ref name="alcaldesregi"/>

==Later life, death, and legacy==
[[File:Calle Alcalde Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez.JPG|thumb|Alcalde Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez street, in the Pavez Polanco neighborhood of Pichilemu]]
According to Jos<U+00E9> Arra<U+00F1>o Acevedo's 1980 article "Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez, Primer Alcalde de Pichilemu", following his retirement from politics in 1906, Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez "stayed watchful to everything that was being done in favour of the commune he led so aptly."<ref name="arra"/> He appears as a subscriber of ''El Puerto'', the first newspaper published in Pichilemu, which only printed three editions. In the first edition of the newspaper, dated 16 January 1908, an article states that Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez and Exequiel Fern<U+00E1>ndez were awarded 200 [[Chilean peso|pesos]] in a raffle held on the previous day in the headquarters of the ''La Uni<U+00F3>n'' newspaper, in Santiago.<ref name="puerto">{{cite news|title=Premiados (Cr<U+00F3>nica)|trans_title=Awarded (Chronicle)|last=Ram<U+00ED>rez O.|first=Augusto A.|page=3|work=El Puerto|location=Pichilemu, Chile|date=16 January 1908|language=Spanish|quote=Los se<U+00F1>ores Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Caro, i Exequiel Fern<U+00E1>ndez salieron favorecidos con 200 pesos cada uno en el sorteo del diario "La Uni<U+00F3>n" de Santiago efectuado ayer.|publisher=Imprenta La <U+00C9>poca}}</ref>

Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez became ill with an unspecified disease in September 1916, which forty days later, in November, "won against his strong physique" and provoked his death at age 86. Caro was subsequently cremated and is buried with his wife Rita, who died at age 98 in 1931, in a mausoleum constructed by their son Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a, located at the churchyard of Ciruelos.<ref name="Arra<U+00F1>o1980"/>

Almost eighty years after his death, in December 1991, the government of Mayor [[Ren<U+00E9> Maturana|Ren<U+00E9> Maturana Maldonado]] decreed, as part of the celebrations of the centennial of the commune's creation, the renaming of several streets of the commune whose original names "caused confusion because they were repeated in other streets", to new names of "relevant people of the [local] history." As a result, J. M. Caro street ({{lang|es|Calle J. M. Caro}}) in the Pavez Polanco neighborhood was renamed to Alcalde Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez street ({{lang|es|Calle Alcalde Caro Mart<U+00ED>nez}}) in honour of the commune's first mayor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=87136&idVersion=|title=Aprueba la denominaci<U+00F3>n de calles y pasajes que indica|trans_title=Naming of the indicated streets and passageways approved|publisher=Library of the National Congress of Chile|language=Spanish|date=31 December 1991|accessdate=10 May 2013|deadurl=no|work=Ley Chile|last=Maturana|first=Ren<U+00E9>|authorlink=Ren<U+00E9> Maturana|last2=Parraguez|first2=Gustavo|archivedate=10 May 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6GWfvFoaq}}</ref>
