'''''Confuciusornis''''' is a genus of primitive crow-sized [[bird]]s from the Early [[Cretaceous]] [[Yixian Formation|Yixian]] and [[Jiufotang Formation]]s of [[China]], dating from 125 to 120 million years ago. Like modern birds, ''Confuciusornis'' had a toothless beak, but close relatives of modern birds such as ''[[Hesperornis]]'' and ''[[Ichthyornis]]'' were toothed, indicating that the loss of teeth occurred convergently in ''Confuciusornis'' and living birds. It is the oldest known bird to have a beak.<ref>Ivanov, M., Hrdlickova, S. & Gregorova, R. (2001) The Complete Encyclopedia of Fossils. Rebo Publishers, Netherlands. pp. 312</ref> It was named after the Chinese moral philosopher [[Confucius]] (551<U+2013>479 BC). ''Confuciusornis'' is one of the most abundant vertebrates found in the Yixian Formation, and several hundred complete, articulated specimens have been found.<ref name="xu&norell2006">Xu, X. and Norell, M.A. (2006). "Non-Avian dinosaur fossils from the Lower Cretaceous Jehol Group of western Liaoning, China."''Geological Journal'', '''41''': 419<U+2013>437.</ref>

==Discovery and naming==
In November 1993 Chinese paleontologists [[Zhou Zhonge]], [[Hu Yoaming]] and [[Hou Lianhai]], of the [[Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology]] at [[Beijing]], were presented a bird fossil bought at a flea market in [[Sihetun]] by amateur paleontologist [[Zhang He]]. It showed a partial skeleton of a bird new to science of which even some feather remains had been preserved. In December 1993 two further specimens were acquired from a farmer, Yang Yushan. Soon afterwards, it was discovered that local farmers were in the process of collecting hundreds of specimens that were provisionally prepared by them to be illegally sold to commercial fossil dealers.<ref>Zhou Z., 1995, "The discovery of Early Cretaceous birds in China", ''Acta Palaeornithologica'' '''181''': 9-22</ref> Many hundreds have since also been added to the official collections of Chinese institutions. In 2010 the [[Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature]] alone possessed 536 specimens.<ref name="Zheng2010"/> The fossils are compressed but otherwise typically very complete often showing the entire feathering of the animal.

Based on the abundant material, six species have been formally named and described: ''C. sanctus'' (the [[type species]]), ''C. dui'', ''C. feducciai'', ''C. jianchangensis'', ''C. chuonzhous'' and ''C. suniae''. The latter two are usually considered synonymous with ''C. sanctus''.<ref name=basalbird2010>Li, D., Sulliven, C., Zhou, Z. and Zhang, Z. (2010). "Basal birds from China: a brief review." ''Chinese Birds'', '''1'''(2): 83<U+2013>96 {{doi|10.5122/cbirds.2010.0002}}</ref> Most species lived in the early [[Aptian]] 125 million year old [[Jianshangou Beds]] of the [[Yixian Formation]], though ''C. jianchangnsis'' is found in the later (120Ma) middle Aptian [[Jiufotang Formation]]. ''C. sanctus'' is known from the former, and is one of the most common vertebrate species found in the Yixian, often present in dense concentrations. At one time forty were discovered on a surface of about 100 m<U+00B2>. This has been explained as the result of entire flocks of birds being simultaneously killed by ash, heat or poisonous gas following the [[volcanic eruption]]s that caused the [[tuff]] stone in which the fossils were found to be deposited as lake sediments.<ref>Wang X., Zhang F,, Xu X., Wang Y., Gu G., 2000, "Taphonomy and mass mortality of ''Confuciusornis'' and feathered dinosaurs at the Sihetun and Zhangjiagou sites in western Liaoning, China", ''Vertebrata PalAsiatica'', '''38'''(supp): 32</ref>

In 1995 Zhou, Hou, Zhang and [[Gu Youcai]] named ''Confuciusornis sanctus''. The generic name combines the philosopher Confucius with a Greek <U+1F44><U+03C1><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03C2>, (''ornis''), "bird". The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] means "holy one" in [[Latin]] and is a translation of Chinese <U+5723><U+8D24>, ''sh<U+00E8>ng<U+200B>xi<U+00E1>n'', "sage", again in reference to Confucius. The [[holotype]] specimen is '''IVPP V10918'''.<ref>Hou L., Zhou Z., Gu Y., Zhang H., 1995, "''Confuciusornis sanctus'', a new Late Jurassic sauriurine bird from China", ''Chinese Science Bulletin'', '''40''': 1545<U+2013>1551</ref> In 1997 Hou named two species. The first was ''Confuciusornis chuonzhous'', based on specimen IVPP V10919, originally a [[paratype]] of ''C. sanctus''. The specific name refers to Chuanzhou, an ancient name for [[Beipiao]]. The second species was ''Confuciusornis suniae'', based on specimen IVPP V11308. The specific name honours madam Sun, the wife of Shikuan Liang who donated the fossil to the IVPP.<ref>Hou L., 1997, [Chinees] [''Mesozoic Birds of China''. Phoenix Valley Provincial Aviary of Taiwan]. Taiwan</ref> In 1999 Hou, Zhou, Zhang, [[Larry Martin]] and [[Alan Feduccia]] named ''Confuciusornis dui'', based on specimen IVPP V11553. The specific name again honours a donating collector: Du Wengya.<ref>Hou L.; Martin, L.D., Zhou Z., Feduccia, A., Zhang F., 1999, "A diapsid skull in a new species of the primitive bird ''Confuciusornis'', ''Nature'' '''399''': 679<U+2013>682</ref> In 2009 [[Zhang Fucheng]] ''et al.'' named ''Confuciusornis feducciai'', based on specimen D2454, the specific name honouring Feduccia.<ref name="Zhang2009">Zhang Z., Gao C., Meng Q., Liu J., Hou L., Zheng G., 2009, "Diversification in an Early Cretaceous avian genus: evidence from a new species of ''Confuciusornis'' from China", ''Journal of Ornithology'', '''150''': 783<U+2013>790</ref> In 2010 [[Li Li (paleontologist)|Li Li]], [[Wang Jingqi]] and [[Hou Shilin]] named ''Confuciusornis jianchangensis'', based on specimen PMOL-AB00114 found at [[Toudaoyingzi]].<ref>L. Li, J.-q. Wang, and S.-l. Hou. 2010. [Chinese] [A new species of Confuciusornis from Lower Cretaceous of Jianchung, Liaoning, China]. ''Global Geology'' '''29'''(2): 183-187</ref>

In 2002 Hou named the genus ''[[Jinzhouornis]]''. [[Luis Chiappe]] later concluded that this is probably a junior synonym of ''Confuciusornis''.

==Description==
[[File:Confuciusornis SIZE.png|thumb|left|upright|Size of ''Confuciusornis'', compared to a human.]]
''Confuciusornis'' was about the size of a modern [[pigeon]], with a wingspan of up to 0.7 meters (2.3&nbsp;ft), and its body weight has been estimated to have been as much as 1.5 kilograms,<ref name=nudds&dyke2010/> or less than 0.2 kilograms.<ref name=paul2010/> ''C. feducciai'' was about a third longer than average specimens of ''C. sanctus''.<ref name="Zhang2009"/> 

''Confuciusornis'' shows a mix of basal and derived traits. It was more "advanced" or derived than ''Archaeopteryx'' in possessing a short tail with a [[pygostyle]] (a bone formed from a series of short, fused tail vertebrae) and a bony [[sternum]], but more basal or "primitive" than modern birds in retaining large claws on the forelimbs, having a primitive skull with a closed eye-socket, and a relatively small breastbone. At first the number of basal characteristics was exaggerated: Hou assumed in 1995 that a long tail was present and mistook grooves in the jaw bones for small degenerated teeth.<ref name="Martin1998"/>

The skull of ''Confuciusornis'' was equipped with a pointed toothless beak. It was relatively heavy-built and immobile, incapable of the [[kinesis (biology)|kinesis]] of modern birds that can raise the snout relative to the back of the skull. This immobility was caused by the presence of a triradiate [[postorbital]] separating the eye-socket from the lower temporal opening, as with more basal theropods, and the [[premaxilla]]e of the snout reaching all the way to the [[frontal bone|frontal]]s, forcing the [[nasal bone|nasals]] to the sides of the snout.<ref name="Chiappeetal1999"/>

Fossils of ''Confuciusornis'' show that it had an exceptionally large [[humerus]] (upper arm bone). Near its shoulder-end this was equipped with a prominent deltopectoral crest. Characteristically this ''crista deltopectoralis'' was with ''Confuciusornis'' pierced by an oval hole which may have reduced the bone's weight or enlarged the attachment area of the flight miscles.  The [[furcula]] or wishbone, like that of ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', was a simple curved bar lacking a pointed process at the back, a [[hypocleidum]].  The sternum (breastbone) was relatively broad and had a low [[Keel (bird)|keel]] which was raised at the back end. This bony keel may or may not have anchored a larger, cartilaginous, keel for enlarged [[pectoral]]{{dn|date=September 2012}} muscles.<ref name="Chiappeetal1999">Chiappe, Luis M., Shu-An, Ji, Qiang, Ji, Norell, Mark A. (1999) "Anatomy and systematics of the Confuciusornithidae (Theropoda:Aves) from the Late Mesozoic of northeastern China" "Bulletin of the American museum of Natural History no.242 89pp.</ref> The [[scapula]]e (shoulder blades) were fused to the strut-like [[coracoid]] bones and may have formed a solid base for the attachment of wing muscles. The orientation of the shoulder joint was sideways, instead of angled upward as in modern birds; this means that ''Confuciusornis'' was unable to lift its wings high above its back. According to a study by [[Phil Senter]] in 2006, the joint was even pointed largely downwards meaning that the humerus could not be lifted above the horizontal. This would make ''Confuciusornis'' incapable of the upstroke required for [[Bird flight|flapping flight]]; the same would have been true for ''Archaeopteryx''.<ref name=senter2006>Senter, P. (2006). "Scapular orientation in theropods and basal birds, and the origin of flapping flight." ''Acta Palaeontologica Polonica'', '''51'''(2): 305<U+2013>313.[http://www.app.pan.pl/acta51/app51-305.pdf PDF fulltext]</ref>

[[File:Confuciusornis 4.png|thumb|upright|Illustration of ''Confuciusornis'' wing bones.]]
The wrist of ''Confuciusornis'' shows fusion, forming a [[carpometacarpus]]. The second and third [[metacarpal]]s were also partially fused but the first was unfused, however, and also the fingers could freely move relative to each other. The second metacarpal, supporting the flight feathers, was very heavily built; its finger carries a small claw. The claw of the first finger to the contrary was very large and curved, that of the third intermediate in size.<ref name="Chiappeetal1999"/> The formula of the finger phalanges was 2-3-4-0-0.

The [[pelvis]] was connected to a [[sacrum]] formed by seven [[sacral vertebra]]e. The [[pubis (bone)|pubis]] was strongly pointing backwards. The left and right ischia were not fused. The [[femur]] was straight; the [[tibia]] only slightly longer. The [[metatarsal]]s of the foot were relatively short and fused to each other and to the lower ankle bones, forming a [[tarsometatarsus]]. A rudimentary fifth metatarsal is present. The first metatarsal was attached to the lower shaft of the second and supported a first toe or [[hallux]], pointing to the back.<ref name="Chiappeetal1999"/> The formula of the toe phalanges was 2-3-4-5-0. The proportions of the toes suggest that they were used for both walking and perching, while the large claws of the thumb and third finger were probably used for climbing.

=== Feathers ===
[[image:Confuciusornis sanctus mmartyniuk.png|thumb|left|Life restoration of ''C. sanctus'']]
The wing feathers of ''Confuciusornis'' were long and modern in appearance. The primary wing feathers of a 0.5 kilogram individual reached 20.7 centimeters in length. The five longest primary feathers (''[[remiges]] primarii'') were more than 3.5 times the length of the hand and relatively longer than those of any living bird, while the secondary feathers of the lower arm were rather short by comparison. Thus, the wing shape was very unlike that of living birds, being long and narrow.<ref name=nudds&dyke2010/> The primary feathers were asymmetrical to varying degree, and especially so in the outermost primaries.<ref name="Chiappeetal1999"/> It is unclear whether the upper arm carried tertiaries. Covert feathers are preserved covering the upper part of the wing feathers in some specimens, and some specimens have preserved the contour feathers of the body.<ref name="Chiappeetal1999"/> Unlike some more advanced birds, ''Confuciusornis'' lacked an [[alula]], or "bastard wing". In modern birds this is formed by feathers anchored to the first digit of the hand, but this digit appears to have been free of feathers and independent of the body of the wing in ''Confuciusornis''.<ref name="Chiappeetal1999"/> According to [[Dieter Stefan Peters]] to compensate for the lack of an alula, the third finger might have formed a separate winglet below the main wing, functioning like the flap of an aircraft.<ref name="Peters1999">D.S. Peters & Q. Ji, 1999, "Mu<U+03B2>te ''Confuciusornis'' klettern?", ''J. Ornithol.'' '''140'''(1): 41<U+2013>50</ref> Despite the relatively advanced and long wing feathers, the forearm bones lacked any indication of quill knobs (''papillae ulnares''), or bony attachment points for the feather ligaments.<ref name="Chiappeetal1999"/>

Many specimens preserve a pair of long, narrow tail feathers, which grew longer than the entire length of the rest of the body. Unlike the feathers of most modern birds, these feathers were not differentiated into a central quill and barbs for most of their length. Rather, most of the feather formed a ribbon-like sheet, about six millimetres wide. Only at the last one quarter of the feather, towards the rounded tip, does the feather become differentiated into a central shaft with interlocking barbs. Many individuals of ''Confuciusornis'' lacked even these two tail feathers, possibly due to [[sexual dimorphism]]. The rest of the tail around the pygostyle was covered in short, non-aerodynamic feather tufts similar to the contour feathers of the body, rather than the familiar feather fan of modern bird tails.<ref name="Chiappeetal1999"/>

=== Colouration ===
In early 2010, a group of scientists led by Zhang Fucheng examined [[fossil]]s with preserved [[melanosomes]] ([[organelle]]s which contain colors). By studying such fossils with an [[electron microscope]], they found melanosomes preserved in a fossil ''Confuciusornis'' specimen, [[IVPP]] V13171.<ref>Zhang, F., X. Xu, M.J. Benton, Stuart L. Kearns ''et al.'' (2010). "Fossilized melanosomes and the colour of Cretaceous dinosaurs and birds", ''Nature'', '''463''': 1075<U+2013>1078. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7284/full/nature08740.html See the article online].</ref> The melanosomes were of two types, [[eumelanosomes]] and [[pheomelanosomes]]. This indicates that ''Confuciusornis'' had hues of [[grey]], [[red]]/[[brown]] and [[black]], possibly something like the modern [[zebra finch]]. It was also the first time an early bird fossil has been shown to contain preserved pheomelanosomes.<ref>[http://esciencenews.com/articles/2010/01/27/the.color.dinosaur.feathers.identified e!Science News: ''The color of dinosaur feathers discovered''.]</ref><ref>[http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/01/27-02.html ScienceNOW: The Lost World, Now in Colors by Sverker Lundin. January, 27 2010.]</ref>

==Paleobiology==
=== Flight ===
''Confuciusornis'' has traditionally been assumed to have been a competent flier based on its extremely long wings with strongly asymmetrical feathers. Other adaptations for improved flight capabilities include: a fused wrist, a short tail, an ossified sternum, a strut-like coracoid, a large deltopectoral crest, a strong [[ulna]] and an enlarged second metacarpal.<ref>Zhou Z. and Farlow, J.O., 2001, "Flight capability and habits of ''Confuciusornis''". In: Gauthier and Gall (eds). ''New perspectives on the origin and early evolution of birds: proceedings of the international symposium in honor of John H. Ostrom''. Peabody Museum of Natural History. Yale University, New Haven. pp. 237-254</ref>  

However, over the years several claims have been made that the flight of ''Confuciusornis'' suffered from more or less severe limitations. 

The first of these regarded problems to attain a steep flight path due to a limited wing amplitude. In the interpretation of Senter (2006) of the position of the shoulder joint, a normal upstroke would be impossible precluding flapping flight entirely. Less radical is the assessment that due to the lack of a keeled sternum and a high acrocoracoid, the ''[[Pectoralis minor muscle|Musculus pectoralis minor]]'' could not serve as a ''M. supracoracoideus'' lifting the humerus via a tendon running through a ''[[foramen triosseum]]''. This, coupled with a limited upstroke caused by a lateral position of the shoulder joint, would have made it difficult to gain altitude. Some authors therefore proposed that ''Confuciusornis'' used its large thumb claws to climb tree trunks. Martin assumed that it could raise its torso almost vertically like a squirrel.<ref name="Martin1998">Martin, L.D., Zhou, Z., Hou, L. & Feduccia, A., 1998, "''Confuciusornis sanctus'' compared to ''Archaeopteryx lithographica''", ''Naturwissenschaften'' '''85''': 286<U+2013>289</ref> [[Daniel Hembree]] however, while acknowledging that tree climbing was likely, pointed out that the rump was apparently not lifted more than 25<U+00B0> relative to the femur in vertical position, as shown by the location of the [[antitrochanter]] in the hip joint.<ref>Hembree, D., 1999, "Re-evaluation of the posture and claws of ''Confuciusornis''", ''Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology'' '''19''': 50A</ref> Dieter S. Peters considered it very unlikely that ''Confuciusornis'' climbed trunks as turning the thumb claw inwards would stretch the very long wing forwards, right in the path of obstructing branches. Peters sees ''Confuciusornis'' as capable of flapping flight but specialised in soaring flight.<ref name="Peters1999"/>

A second problem is the strength of the feathers. In 2010 [[Robert Nudds]] and [[Gareth Dyke]] published a study arguing that in both ''Confuciusornis'' and ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', the ''raches'' (central shafts) of the primary feathers were too thin and weak to have remained rigid during the power stroke required for true flight. They argued that ''Confuciusornis'' would at most have employed [[gliding flight]], which is also consistent with the unusual adaptations seen in its upper arm bones, and more likely used its wings for mere parachuting, limiting fall speed if it dropped from a tree.<ref name=nudds&dyke2010>Nudds, R.L. and Dyke, G.J (2010). "Narrow primary feather rachises in ''Confuciusornis'' and ''Archaeopteryx'' suggest poor flight ability." ''Science'', '''328'''(5980): 887. {{doi|10.1126/science.1188895}} PMID 20466930</ref> [[Gregory S. Paul]], however, disagreed with their study. He argued that Nudds and Dyke had overestimated the weights of these early birds, and that more accurate weight estimates allowed powered flight even with relatively narrow raches. Nudds and Dyke assumed a weight of 1.5 kilograms for ''Confuciusornis'', as heavy as the modern [[Common Teal|teal]]. Paul argued that a more reasonable body weight estimate is about 180&nbsp;grams, less than that of a [[pigeon]]. Paul also noted that ''Confuciusornis'' is commonly found as large assemblages in lake bottom sediments with little to no evidence of extensive postmortem transport, and that it would be highly unusual for gliding animals to be found in such large numbers in deep water. Rather, this evidence suggests that ''Confuciusornis'' traveled in large flocks over the lake surfaces, a habitat consistent with a flying animal.<ref name=paul2010>Paul, G.S. (2010). "Comment on 'Narrow Primary Feather Rachises in ''Confuciusornis'' and ''Archaeopteryx'' Suggest Poor Flight Ability.'" ''Science'',
'''330'''(6002): 320. (15 October 2010). {{doi|10.1126/science.1192963}}</ref> A number of Chinese researchers questioned the correctness of the rachis measurements, stating that the specimens they had studied showed a shaft thickness of 2.1 to 2.3 millimetres as compared to the 1.2 millimetre reported by Nudds and Dyke.<ref name="Zheng2010">Xiaoting Zheng, Xing Xu, Zhonghe Zhou, Desui Miao, and Fucheng Zhang, 2010, "Comment on <U+201C>Narrow Primary Feather Rachises in ''Confuciusornis'' and ''Archaeopteryx'' Suggest Poor Flight Ability<U+201D>", ''Science'' 15 October 2010: 320</ref> The latter replied that, apart from the weight aspect, such greater shaft thickness alone would make flapping flight possible; however, they allowed for the possibility of two species being present in the Chinese fossil material with a differing rachis diameter.<ref>Nudds, R.L. & Dyke G., 2010, Response to comments on <U+201C>Narrow Primary Feather Rachises in ''Confuciusornis'' and ''Archaeopteryx'' Suggest Poor Flight Ability<U+201D>", ''Science'' 15 October 2010: 320</ref>

===Sexual variation===
[[Image:ConfusornisSanctus-PaleozoologicalMuseumOfChina-May23-08.jpg|thumb|''C. sanctus'' fossil preserving long wing and tail feathers]]
Many specimens of ''Confuciusornis'' preserve a single pair of long, streamer-like tail feathers.  However, most do not, even specimens which otherwise have exquisitely preserved feathers on the rest of the body; their predominance has been estimated to be as high as 90-95%.<ref name="Martin1998"/>  This difference has been suggested to indicate [[sexual dimorphism]], with one gender (likely the males) using the streamer-like feathers in courtship displays. However, while sexual variation is the most obvious explanation for the presence or absence of long tail feathers, other factors cannot be ruled out. For example, it is possible that some individuals lack tail feathers because they were fossilized during [[molt]]ing. As in modern birds, molting individuals may have been present alongside non-molting individuals, and males and females may have molted at different times during the year.<ref name="Chiappeetal1999"/>

Due to the large number of specimens, [[statistical analysis]] can be used to investigate this problem. In 2008 Chiappe ''et alii'' published a [[morphometrics|morphometrical]] study of 106 fossils. The population showed a clear [[bimodal distribution]] of the size of the animals with two [[weight class]]es. However, there was no [[correlation]] between size and the possession of the long tail feathers. From this it was concluded that either the sexes did not differ in size or both sexes had the long feathers. The first case was deemed most likely which left the size distribution to be explained. It was hypothesised that the smaller animals consisted of very young individuals, that the large animals were adults and that the rarity of individuals with an intermediate size was caused by ''Confuciusornis'' experiencing a [[growth spurt]] just prior to reaching adulthood, the shortness of which would have prevented many becoming fossilised during this phase.<ref>Chiappe, L.M.; Marugan-Lobon, J.; Ji S. and Zhou Z., 2008, "Life history of a basal bird: morphometrics of the Early Cretaceous Confuciusornis", ''Biology Letters'' '''4'''(6): 719-723</ref> This interpretation was criticised by Dieter S. Peters who pointed out that, as the smaller animals were not [[neonate]]s, the young of ''Confuciusornis'' had to grow very fast immediately after hatching regardless. This would then imply two growth spurts, which assumption was not very parsimonious. He thought the data would be more simply explained by assuming that both sexes had the long feathers and one of them was the largest. He favoured the possibility that these were the females, having observed such a pattern with the modern [[Pheasant-tailed Jacana]] ''Hydrophasianus chirurgus'', a water-bird in which both sexes have long tails and the female sex is the heaviest. He accounted for the fact that most specimens show no tails at all by the possibility that ''Confuciusornis'' shed the feathers as a defence mechanism, a method used by several extant species, which would have been triggered by the stress induced by the very volcanic explosion that buried the animals.<ref>Winfried S. Peters and Dieter Stefan Peters, 2009, "Life history, sexual dimorphism and <U+2018>ornamental<U+2019> feathers in the mesozoic bird ''Confuciusornis sanctus''", ''Biology Letters'', '''5''': 817-820</ref>
[[File:Confuciusornis sanctus fossil.jpg|thumb|upright|Short tailed ''C. sanctus'' specimen]]
The growth speed relevant to this question can be independently measured by researching the bone structure. In 1998 Zhang determined that growth was fast, leading to [[fibrolamellar bone]].<ref>Zhang, F., L. Hou, and L. Ouyang, 1998, "Osteological microstructure of ''Confuciusornis'': preliminary report", ''Vertebrata PalAsiatica'' '''36''': 126<U+2013>135</ref> Comparison with the bone structure of an [[alligator]] indicated that ''Confuciusornis'' had a high metabolism comparable to that of modern birds.<ref>Zhang, F.-C., Xu X. & L<U+00FC> J., 1999, "Some microstructure difference among ''Confuciusornis'', ''Alligator'' and a small theropod dinosaur, and its implications", ''Paleoworld'', December 1999: 296<U+2013>308</ref> The growth speed of ''Confuciusornis'' would have been similar to that of ''[[Beipiaosaurus]]''.<ref>Zhang, F.-C., et al., 2000, "Microstructures of ''Confuciusornis'' and ''Beipiaosaurus'' and their physiological implications", ''Vertebrata Pal-Asiatica'' '''38''' (suppl. Abstracts 5th Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution Meeting and Jehol Biota Symposium, Beijing 2000): 36</ref> A study by [[Armand de Ricql<U+00E8>s]] in 2003 indicated that growth was essentially modern, ''Confuciusornis'' reaching its maximum size in at most twenty weeks, perhaps as few as thirteen. Basal birds would have limited their size, not by slowing growth but by limiting the period of growth.<ref>De Ricql<U+00E8>s, A.J., Padian, K., Horner, J.R., Alamm, E.T. & Myhrvold, N., 2003, "Osteohistology of ''Confuciusornis sanctus'' (Theropoda: Aves)", ''Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology'', '''23''': 373<U+2013>386</ref>

===Diet===
[[File:Sinocalliopteryx gigas feeding on the primitive bird Confuciusornis - journal.pone.0044012.g008.png|left|thumb|''Confuciusornis'' being preyed upon by ''[[Sinocalliopteryx gigas]]''.]]
There are immature specimens known, and from the analysis of bone growth patterns of young adults it has been estimated that ''Confuciusornis'' reached maturity somewhat slower than extant small birds, but faster than advanced dinosaurs (de Ricql<U+00E8>s ''et al.'', 2003), which might indicate an omnivorous diet similar to modern [[crow]]s.

It has been hypothesized that ''Confuciusornis'' fed on plant materials due to its toothless beak, but no [[gastrolith]]s or stomach contents had been reported (Zhou & Zhang, 2003). Dals<U+00E4>tt and colleagues (2006) described a specimen, [[Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology|IVPP]] V13313 found in the Jiufotang Beds, that preserves seven to nine [[vertebra]]e and several ribs of a small fish, probably ''[[Jinanichthys]]''. These fish bones are formed into a tight cluster about six millimeters across, and the cluster is in contact with the seventh and eighth [[cervical vertebrae]] of the bird. In this position it was likely in the crop of the bird, which may have been preparing to regurgitate a [[Pellet (ornithology)|pellet]] when it died. No other fish remains are present in the slab. (Dals<U+00E4>tt ''et al.'', 2006).

Several extant bird species have been presented as modern analogues of ''Confuciusornis'' providing insight into its possible lifestyle. Dieter S. Peters thought that it could be best compared with the [[White-tailed Tropicbird]] ''Phaeton lepturus'', a fisher that too has a long tail and narrow wings <U+2014> and even often nests in the neighbourhood of volcanoes.<ref name="Peters1999"/> The [[paradise kingfisher]]s (genus ''[[Tanysiptera]]'') of modern [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]] have elongated "racket plumes" as their central tail feathers, giving them a superficial resemblance to ''Confuciusornis''. These kingfishers also take fish as prey, but they are not specialized fishers. They take many insects and other small prey from their forest habitat.<ref name="Bleiweiss2005">Bleiwess, Robert "Development and evolution of avian racket plumes: Fine structure and serial homology of the wire" Journal of Morphology 194:1 pp.23<U+2013>39 DOI

Comparisons between the [[sclerotic ring|scleral ring]]s supporting the eyes of ''Confuciusornis'' and modern birds and other reptiles indicate that it may have been [[Diurnality|diurnal]], similar to most modern birds.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schmitz, L.; Motani, R. |year=2011 |title=Nocturnality in Dinosaurs Inferred from Scleral Ring and Orbit Morphology |journal=Science |volume=332 |issue= |pages= |doi=10.1126/science.1200043|bibcode = 2011Sci...332..705S |pmid=21493820}}</ref>

==Classification==
Hou assigned ''Confuciusornis'' to the [[Confuciusornithidae]] in 1995. At first he assumed it was a member of the [[Enantiornithes]] and the sister taxon of ''[[Gobipteryx]]''. Later he understood that ''Confuciusornis'' was not a enantiornith but concluded it was the sister taxon of the Enantiornithes, within a larger [[Sauriurae]].<ref>Zhou Z, and Hou L., 1998, "''Confuciusornis'' and the early evolution of birds", ''Vertebrata PalAsiatica'' '''36'''(2): 136-146</ref> This was heavily criticised by Chiappe who regarded Sauriurae to be [[paraphyletic]] as there were insufficient shared traits that indicated that the Confuciusornithidae and the Enantiornithes were closely related.<ref>Chiappe, L., 1997, "The Chinese early bird ''Confuciusornis'' and the paraphyletic status of <<Sauriurae>>", ''Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology'', '''17'''(3): 37A</ref>  In 2001 [[Ji Qiang]] suggested an alternative position as the sister taxon of the [[Ornithothoraces]].<ref>Ji Q., 2001, [Chinees] "New advances in the study of the primitive bird ''Confuciusornis'', ''Geological Science and Technology Information'' 20: 30-34</ref>

In 2002 Ji's hypothesis was confirmed by a [[cladistic analysis]] by Chiappe, who defined a new group: the [[Pygostylia]] of which ''Confuciusornis'' is by definition the most basal member.<ref>L. M. Chiappe, 2002, "Basal bird phylogeny: problems and solutions". In: L. M. Chiappe and L. M. Witmer (eds.), ''Mesozoic Birds: Above the Heads of Dinosaurs''. University of California Press, Berkeley pp. 448-472</ref> Several traits of ''Confuciusornis'' illustrate its position in the tree of life; it has a more "primitive" skull than ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', but it is the first known bird to have lost the long tail of ''Archaeopteryx'' and develop fused tail vertebrae, a [[pygostyle]].<ref name="Clarke&Norell2002">Clarke,,Julia. A. , Norell,  Mark. A. (2002) "The Morphology and Phylogenetic Position of ''Apsaravis ukhaana'' from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia" American Museum Novitates, No. 3387, American Museum of Natural History, New York, NY 10024.</ref> One controversial study concluded that ''Confuciusornis'' may be more closely related to ''[[Microraptor]]'' and other [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]] than to ''Archaeopteryx'', but this study was criticized on methodological grounds (Mayr ''et al.'', 2005).

The present standard interpretation of the [[phylogenetic]] position of ''Confuciusornis'' can be shown in this [[cladogram]]:

A close relative, the confuciusornithid ''[[Changchengornis hengdaoziensis]]'', also lived in the Yixian Formation. ''Changchengornis'' also possessed the paired, long tail feathers, as did several more advanced [[Enantiornithes|enantiornith]] birds. True, mobile tail fans only appeared in [[ornithuromorpha|ornithuromorph]] birds, and possibly in the enantiornithine ''[[Shanweiniao]]''.<ref name="Clarkeetal2006">Clarke, Julia A., Zhou, Zhonghe, Zhang, Fucheng.
