'''Churches of Christ''' are [[Autonomy|autonomous]] [[Christian]] [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregations]] associated with one another through common beliefs and practices. They seek to base doctrine and practice on the [[Bible]] alone, and see themselves as restoring the [[New Testament]] [[Christian Church|church]] established by [[Christ]].

Historically, Churches of Christ in the United States were recognized as a distinct movement by the U.S. Religious Census of 1906. Prior to that they had been reported in the religious census as part of the movement that had its roots in the [[Second Great Awakening]] under the leadership of [[Thomas Campbell (Restoration movement)|Thomas]] and [[Alexander Campbell (Restoration movement)|Alexander Campbell]], Walter Scott, and [[Barton W. Stone]].  Those leaders had declared their independence from their [[Presbyterian]] roots, seeking a fresh start to restore the [[New Testament]] church, and abandoning [[creeds]]. The names "Church of Christ," "Christian Church" and "Disciples of Christ" were adopted by the movement because they believed these terms to be biblical.

A split occurred between those who used [[musical instrument]]s in [[Christian worship|worship]] (now usually known as [[Independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ]] and [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]]) and those who chose to sing "[[a cappella]]" because the use of instruments is not mentioned in the New Testament. It is this latter branch which is the subject of this article. Though officially recognized as distinct movements from 1906, the actual separation of the Churches of Christ from the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Christian Churches]] had already been taking place gradually for decades.

As a result, most divisions among Churches of Christ have been the result of "methodological" disputes.  These are meaningful to members of this movement because of the seriousness with which they take the goal of "restoring the form and structure of the primitive church".<ref name="Encyclopedia of Religion in the South"/>{{rp|212}}

Three quarters of the congregations and 87% of the membership are described by the ''The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement'' as "mainstream", sharing a consensus on practice and theology.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Churches of Christ"/>{{rp|213}}  The remaining congregations may be grouped into four categories, the largest of which is [[the churches of Christ (non-institutional)]].  Approximately 2,055 congregations fall in this category.<ref name=Who>{{cite web |url=http://www.christianchronicle.org/article621~Who_are_we%3F |title=Who are we? |accessdate=2007-10-29 |last=Ross |first=Bobby Jr |work=Features |publisher=The Christian Chronicle}}</ref><ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Churches of Christ"/>{{rp|213}}  The second group does not use separate [[Sunday school|Bible classes]], and consists of approximately 1,100 congregations.  A third group does not use multiple [[communion (Christian)|communion]] cups (approximately 550 congregations; this category overlaps somewhat with those congregations that do not use separate Bible classes for children).  The fourth group "emphasize[s] mutual edification by various leaders in the churches and oppose[s] one person doing most of the preaching".  This group includes roughly 130 congregations.<ref name=Who/><ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Churches of Christ"/>{{rp|213}}  These groups generally differ from the mainstream consensus in specific practices, rather than in theological perspectives, and tend to have smaller congregations on average.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Churches of Christ"/>{{rp|213}}

Churches of Christ seek to practice the principle of the [[Bible]] being the only source to find doctrine (also known as "[[sola scriptura]]").<ref name="Rhodes 2005"/>{{rp|123}}<ref>"Whenever there are disagreements in the Churches of Christ, a 'reference to the scriptures is made in settling every religious question.  A pronouncement from the scripture is considered the final word.'" page 240, Carmen Renee Berry, ''The Unauthorized Guide to Choosing a Church'', [[Brazos Press]], 2003</ref> The Bible is generally regarded as [[Biblical inspiration|inspired]] and [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]].<ref name="Rhodes 2005"/>{{rp|123}} Churches of Christ generally see the Bible as historically accurate and literal, unless scriptural context obviously indicates otherwise. Regarding church practices, worship, and doctrine, there is great liberty from congregation to congregation in interpreting what is biblically permissible, as congregations are not controlled by a denominational hierarchy.<ref>See F. LaGard Smith, "The Cultural Church", 20th Century Christian, 1992, 237 pages, ISBN 978-0890981313</ref>  Their approach to the Bible is driven by the "assumption that the Bible is sufficiently plain and simple to render its message obvious to any sincere believer".<ref name="Encyclopedia of Religion in the South"/>{{rp|212}}  Related to this is an assumption that the Bible provides an understandable "blueprint or constitution" for the church.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Religion in the South"/>{{rp|213}}

Historically, three [[Biblical hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] approaches have been used among Churches of Christ.<ref name="Olbricht 1995">Thomas H. Olbricht, [http://www.acu.edu/sponsored/restoration_quarterly/archives/1990s/vol_37_no_1_contents/olbricht.html "Hermeneutics in the Churches of Christ,"] ''Restoration Quarterly'', Vol. 37/No. 1 (1995)</ref><ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Hermeneutics">Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, ''The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, ISBN 0802838987, 9780802838988, 854 pages, entry on ''Hermeneutics''</ref>{{rp|387}}
* Analysis of commands, examples, and necessary inferences;
* [[Dispensationalism|Dispensational]] analysis distinguishing between Patriarchal, Mosaic and Christian dispensations; and
* [[Historical-grammatical method|Grammatico-historical]] analysis.

The relative importance given to each of these three strategies has varied over time and between different contexts.<ref name="Olbricht 1995"/>  The general impression in the current Churches of Christ is that the group's hermeneutics are entirely based on the command, example, inference approach.<ref name="Olbricht 1995"/>  In practice, interpretation has been deductive, and heavily influenced by the group's central commitment to [[ecclesiology]] and [[Christian soteriology|soteriology]].<ref name="Olbricht 1995"/>  [[Inductive reasoning]] has been used as well, as when all of the conversion accounts from the book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] are collated and analyzed to determine the steps necessary for [[salvation]].<ref name="Olbricht 1995"/>  One student of the movement summarized the traditional approach this way: "In most of their theologizing, however, my impression is that spokespersons in the Churches of Christ reason from Scripture in a [[deductive]] manner, arguing from one premise or hypothesis to another so as to arrive at a conclusion. In this regard the approach is much like that of science which, in practice moves deductively from one hypothesis to another, rather than in a [[Baconian method|Baconian]] inductive manner."<ref name="Olbricht 1995"/>  In recent years, changes in the degree of emphasis placed on ecclesiology and soteriology has spurred a reexamination of the traditional hermeneutics among some associated with the Churches of Christ.<ref name="Olbricht 1995"/>

A debate arose during the 1980s over the use of the command, example, necessary inference model for identifying the "essentials" of the [[New Testament]] faith.  Some argued that it fostered [[legalism (theology)|legalism]] and advocated a hermeneutic based on the character of [[God in Christianity|God]], [[Christ]] and the [[Holy Spirit]].  Traditionalists urged the rejection of this "new hermeneutic".<ref>Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, ''The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, ISBN 0802838987, 9780802838988, 854 pages, page 219</ref>  Use of this [[Wiktionary:tripartite|tripartite]] formula has declined as congregations have shifted to an increased "focus on 'spiritual' issues like discipleship, servanthood, family and praise".<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Hermeneutics"/>{{rp|388}}  Relatively greater emphasis has been given to [[Old Testament]] studies in congregational Bible classes and at affiliated colleges in recent decades.  While it is still not seen as authoritative for Christian worship, church organization, or regulating the Christian's life, some have argued that it is theologically authoritative.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Hermeneutics"/>{{rp|388}}

Many scholars associated with the Churches of Christ embrace the methods of modern [[Biblical criticism]] but not the associated anti-supernaturalistic views.  More generally, the classical grammatico-historical method is prevalent, which provides a basis for some openness to alternative approaches to understanding the scriptures.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Hermeneutics"/>{{rp|389}}

===Doctrine of Salvation (Soteriology)===
Churches of Christ are strongly anti-[[Calvinism|Calvinist]] in their understanding of [[salvation]] and generally present conversion as "obedience to the proclaimed facts of the gospel rather than as the result of an emotional, Spirit-initiated conversion".<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Churches of Christ"/>{{rp|215}} Churches of Christ hold the view that humans of accountable age are lost because of their [[Christian views of sin|sins]].<ref name="Rhodes 2005"/>{{rp|124}} These lost souls can be redeemed because [[Jesus Christ]], the Son of God, offered Himself as the atoning sacrifice.<ref name="Rhodes 2005"/>{{rp|124}}  Children too young to understand right from wrong, and make a conscious choice between the two, are believed to be innocent of sin.<ref name="Perfect Stranger"/>{{rp|107}}<ref name="Rhodes 2005"/>{{rp|124}}  The age when this occurs is generally believed to be around 13.<ref name="Perfect Stranger"/>{{rp|107}}

Churches of Christ generally teach that the process of salvation involves the following steps:<ref name="Who Are the churches of Christ"/>

#One must be properly taught, and hear ({{bverse|Romans|10:17}}, {{bverse|Matthew|7:24}});
#One must [[Religious belief|believe]] or have [[faith]] ({{bverse|Hebrews|11:6}}, {{bverse|Mark|16:15-16}});
#One must [[repent]], which means turning from one's former lifestyle and choosing God's ways ({{bverse|Acts|2:38}}, {{bverse|Acts|17:30}}, {{bverse|Luke|13:3}});
#One must [[confess]] belief that Jesus is the son of God ({{bverse|Matthew|10:32-33}}; {{bverse|Acts|8:36-37}});
#One must be baptized for the remission of sins ({{bverse|Acts|2:38}}; {{bverse|1Peter|3:20-21}}; {{bverse|Romans|6:3-5}}; {{bverse|Mark|16:16}}; {{bverse|Acts|22:16}}); and
#One must remain faithful unto death ({{bverse|Revelation|2:10}}).

Beginning in the 1960s, many preachers began placing more emphasis on the role of [[Divine grace|grace]] in salvation, instead of focusing exclusively implementing all of the New Testament commands and examples.<ref name="Hughes and Roberts, 2001">Richard Thomas Hughes and R. L. Roberts, ''The Churches of Christ'', 2nd Edition, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001, ISBN 0313233128, 9780313233128, 345 pages</ref>{{rp|152,153}}  This was not an entirely new approach, as others had actively "affirmed a theology of free and unmerited grace", but it did represent a change of emphasis with grace becoming "a theme that would increasingly define this tradition".<ref name="Hughes and Roberts, 2001"/>{{rp|153}}

Churches of Christ have historically had the most conservative position on baptism among the various branches of the [[Restoration Movement]], understanding baptism by immersion to be a necessary part of conversion.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Baptism">Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, ''The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, ISBN 0802838987, 9780802838988, 854 pages, entry on ''Baptism''</ref>{{rp|61}}  The most significant disagreements concerned the extent to which a correct understanding of the role of baptism is necessary for its validity.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Baptism"/>{{rp|61}}  [[David Lipscomb]] consistently argued that if a believer was baptized out of a desire to obey God, the baptism was valid, even if the individual did not fully understand the role baptism plays in salvation.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Baptism"/>{{rp|61}}  [[Austin McGary]] argued strongly that to be valid, the convert must also understand that baptism is for the forgiveness of sins.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Baptism"/>{{rp|62}}  McGary's view became the prevailing one in the early 20th century, but the approach advocated by Lipscomb never totally disappeared.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Baptism"/>{{rp|62}}  More recently, the rise of the [[International Churches of Christ]] (who required the re-baptism of anyone joining their movement) has caused some to reexamine the issue.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Baptism"/>{{rp|66}}

Churches of Christ consistently teach that in baptism a believer surrenders his life in faith and obedience to God, and that God "by the merits of Christ's blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes the state of the person from an alien to a citizen of God's kingdom.  Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do."<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Baptism"/>{{rp|66}}  Baptism is a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it "is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God".<ref name="Theology Matters"/>{{rp|112}}  While Churches of Christ do not describe baptism as a "sacrament", their view of it can legitimately be described as "sacramental".<ref name="Baptism, Why Wait?"/>{{rp|186}}<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Baptism"/>{{rp|66}}  They see the power of baptism coming from God, who chose to use baptism as a vehicle, rather than from the water or the act itself,<ref name="Baptism, Why Wait?"/>{{rp|186}} and understand baptism to be an integral part of the conversion process, rather than as only a symbol of conversion.<ref name="Baptism, Why Wait?"/>{{rp|184}}  A recent trend is to emphasize the transformational aspect of baptism: instead of describing it as nothing more than a legal requirement or sign of something that happened in the past, it is seen as "the event that places the believer 'into Christ' where God does the ongoing work of transformation".<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Baptism"/>{{rp|66}}  There is a minority that downplays the importance of baptism in order to avoid sectarianism, but the broader trend is to "reexamine the richness of the biblical teaching of baptism and to reinforce its central and essential place in Christianity".<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Baptism"/>{{rp|66}}

Because of the belief that baptism is a necessary part of [[salvation]], some [[Baptists]] hold that the Churches of Christ endorse the doctrine of [[baptismal regeneration]].<ref name="Foster">Douglas A.

===Non-instrumental worship===

The Churches of Christ generally combine the lack of any historical evidence that the early church used [[musical instrument]]s in [[Christian worship|worship]] <ref name="Howard 1971"/>{{rp|237-238}}<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Instrumental Music"/>{{rp|415}}<ref name="I Just Want to Be a Christian"/>{{rp|47}} and the belief that there is no scriptural support for using instruments in the church's [[Church service|worship service]]<ref name="Who Are the churches of Christ"/><ref name="Howard 1971"/>{{rp|244-246}} to decide that instruments should not be used today in worship. Churches of Christ have historically practiced [[a cappella]] music in worship services.<ref name="Who Are the churches of Christ"/><ref name="Unauthorized Guide"/>{{rp|240}}<ref name="Rhodes 2005"/>{{rp|124}}

====Eschatology====
Regarding [[eschatology]] (a branch of theology concerned with the final events in the history of the world or of humankind), Churches of Christ are generally [[amillennial]], their originally prevalent [[postmillennialism]] (evident in [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]]'s ''Millennial Harbinger'') having dissipated around the era of the [[First World War]].  Before then, many leaders were "moderate historical premillennialists" who did not advocate specific historical interpretations.  Churches of Christ have moved away from [[premillennialism]] as [[Dispensationalism|dispensational]] [[millennialism]] has come more to fore in Protestant [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] circles.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Churches of Christ"/>{{rp|219}}<ref>Dispensational premillennialism is characterized by an emphasis on the [[rapture]], the restoration of Israel, [[Armageddon]] and related ideas.</ref>  [[Amillennialism]] and [[postmillennialism]] are the prevailing views today.<ref name="Rhodes 2005"/>{{rp|125}}<ref>A small group of congregations which in the first half of the 20th century took a premillennial view under the influence of [[Robert Henry Boll]] was, by the end of the century, largely back in fellowship with the mainline.

====Work of the Holy Spirit====
During the late 19th century, the prevailing view in the Restoration Movement was that the [[Holy Spirit]] currently acts only through the influence of inspired scripture.<ref name="Foster 2003">Douglas A.

This view came to prevail over that of [[Barton W. Stone]], who believed the Spirit had a more direct role in the life of the Christian.<ref name="Foster 2003"/>  Since the early 20th century, many among the Churches of Christ have moved away from this "word-only" theory of the operation of the Holy Spirit.<ref>See for example, Harvey Floyd, ''Is the Holy Spirit for me?: A search for the meaning of the Spirit in today's church'', 20th Century Christian, 1981, ISBN 978-0890984468, 128 pages</ref>  As one student of the movement puts it, "[f]or better or worse, those who champion the so-called word-only theory no longer have a hold on the minds of the constituency of Churches of Christ. Though relatively few have adopted outright charismatic and third wave views and remained in the body, apparently the spiritual waves have begun to erode that rational rock."<ref name="Foster 2003"/>

===Early Restoration Movement history===

The [[Restoration Movement]] originated with the convergence of several independent efforts to go back to [[Apostolic Age|apostolic Christianity]].<ref name="Redigging the Wells"/>{{rp|27}}<ref name="Allen & Hughes 1988"/>{{rp|101}}  Two were of particular importance to the development of the movement.<ref name="Redigging the Wells"/>{{rp|27}}<ref name="Allen & Hughes 1988"/>{{rp|101-106}} The first, led by [[Barton W. Stone]] began at [[Cane Ridge]], [[Kentucky]] and called themselves simply "Christians".  The second began in western [[Pennsylvania]] and was led by [[Thomas Campbell (clergyman)|Thomas Campbell]] and his son, [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]]; they used the name "Disciples of Christ". Both groups sought to restore the whole Christian church on the pattern set forth in the [[New Testament]], and both believed that [[creed]]s kept Christianity divided.<ref name="Redigging the Wells"/>{{rp|27-32}}<ref name="Allen & Hughes 1988"/>{{rp|101-106}}

The Campbell movement was characterized by a "systematic and rational reconstruction" of the early church, in contrast to the Stone movement which was characterized by radical freedom and lack of [[dogma]].<ref name="Allen & Hughes 1988"/>{{rp|106-108}}  Despite their differences, the two movements agreed on several critical issues.<ref name="Allen & Hughes 1988"/>{{rp|108}} Both saw restoring the early church as a route to Christian freedom, and both believed that unity among Christians could be achieved by using apostolic Christianity as a model.<ref name="Allen & Hughes 1988"/>{{rp|108}}  The commitment of both movements to restoring the early church and to uniting Christians was enough to motivate a union between many in the two movements.<ref name="Hughes and Roberts, 2001"/>{{rp|8,9}}  While emphasizing that the Bible is the only source to seek doctrine, an acceptance of Christians with diverse opinions was the norm in the quest for truth.

More basic were differences in the underlying approach to Biblical interpretation.

For the Christian Churches, any practices not expressly forbidden could be considered.<ref name="McAlister & Tucker, 1975"/>{{rp|242-247}}

In 1968, at the International Convention of Christian Churches (Disciples of Christ), those Christian Churches that favored cooperative mission work adopted a new "provisional design" for their work together, becoming the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]].<ref name="Garrett 2002"/>{{rp|495}} Those congregations that chose not to be associated with the new denominational organization went their own way as the [[Independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ]], completing a separation that had begun decades before.<ref name="Garrett 2002"/>{{rp|407-409}}  The Independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ have both organizational and hermeneutic differences with the churches of Christ discussed in this article.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Religion in the South"/>{{rp|186}}  For example, they have a loosely organized convention and view scriptural silence on an issue more permissively,<ref name="Encyclopedia of Religion in the South"/>{{rp|186}} but they are more closely related to the churches of Christ in their theology and ecclesiology than they are with the Christian Churches (Disciples of Christ).<ref name="Encyclopedia of Religion in the South"/>{{rp|186}} Some see divisions in the movement as the result of the tension between the goals of restoration and ecumenism, with the Churches of Christ and Independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ resolving the tension by stressing restoration, while the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) resolved the tension by stressing ecumenism.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Religion in the South"/>{{rp|210}}<ref name="Garrett 2002"/>{{rp|383}}

Reliable reports have come to me of white women, members of the church, becoming so animated over a [[Marshall Keeble|certain colored preacher]] as to go up to him after a sermon and shake hands with him holding his hand in both of theirs. That kind of thing will turn the head of most white preachers, and sometimes affect their conduct, and anybody ought to know that it will make fools out of the negroes. For any woman in the church to so far forget her dignity, and lower herself so, just because a negro has learned enough about the gospel to preach it to his race, is pitiable indeed.

===Separation of the International Churches of Christ===
The [[International Churches of Christ]] had their roots in a "discipling" movement that arose among the mainline Churches of Christ during the 1970s.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: ICOC">Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L.

In 1967, Chuck Lucas was minister of the 14th Street Church of Christ in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]], [[Florida]] (later renamed the Crossroads Church of Christ).  That year he started a new project known as Campus Advance (based on principles borrowed from the [[Campus Crusade]] and the [[Shepherding Movement]]).  Centered on the [[University of Florida]], the program called for a strong evangelical outreach and an intimate religious atmosphere in the form of ''soul talks'' and ''prayer partners.''  ''Soul talks'' were held in student residences and involved prayer and sharing overseen by a leader who delegated authority over group members.  ''Prayer partners '' referred to the practice of pairing a new Christian with an older guide for personal assistance and direction.  Both procedures led to "in-depth involvement of each member in one another's lives", and critics accused Lucas of fostering cultism.<ref name="alt religions">{{cite book | last = Paden | first = Russell | editor = Timothy Miller | title = America's Alternative Religions | url = http://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&dq=%22international+churches+of+christ%22%7C%22boston+church+of+christ%22&id=og_u0Re1uwUC | format = | accessdate = 2007-08-07 | year =1995  | month = July | publisher = State University of New York Press | location = Albany | isbn = 978-0-7914-2397-4 | pages = 133<U+2013>36 | chapter = The Boston Church of Christ | chapterurl = http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA133&lpg=PA133&dq=%22international+churches+of+christ%22%7C%22boston+church+of+christ%22&sig=xJd6vwb-MYNOHOUFTtE7pctlbxc&id=og_u0Re1uwUC&ots=FNRFOjJOvr

The Crossroads Movement later spread into some other Churches of Christ.  One of Lucas' converts, [[Kip McKean]], moved to the Boston area in 1979 and began working with "would-be disciples" in the Lexington Church of Christ.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: ICOC"/>{{rp|418}}  He asked them to "redefine their commitment to Christ," and introduced the use of discipling partners.  The congregation grew rapidly, and was renamed the Boston Church of Christ.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: ICOC"/>{{rp|418}} In the early 1980s, the focus of the movement moved to Boston, Massachusetts where [[Kip McKean]] and the Boston Church of Christ became prominently associated with the trend.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: ICOC"/>{{rp|418}}<ref name="alt religions"/>{{rp|133,134}} With the national leadership located in [[Boston]], during the 1980s it commonly became known as the "Boston movement".<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: ICOC"/>{{rp|418}}<ref name="alt religions"/>{{rp|133,134}}  A formal break was made from the mainline Churches of Christ in 1993 with the organization of the International Churches of Christ.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: ICOC"/>{{rp|418}}  This new designation formalized a division that was already in existence between those involved with the Crossroads/Boston Movement and "mainline" Churches of Christ.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: ICOC"/>{{rp|418,419}}<ref name="Garrett 2002"/>{{rp|442}} Other names that have been used for this movement include the "Crossroads movement," "Multiplying Ministries," the "Discipling Movement" and the "Boston Church of Christ".<ref name="alt religions"/>{{rp|133}}

Many in leadership positions issued public apologies for their participation in authoritative abuses, and some resigned or were asked to leave.  By 2004, Boston, [[Atlanta]], and [[New York City]] had lost over 30% of their members, and some entire congregations severed their ties with the ICOC.<ref name="threat">{{Cite web|url=http://www.newcovpub.com/icc/update2005.htm|title=ICOC Update 2005: Is the Threat Resurfacing?|accessdate=2007-07-09|publisher=New Covenant Publications|year=2005|author=Greeson, Timothy}}</ref>  Local fellowships varied in their reactions to the power vacuum.  ICOC Chronicler Chris Lee asserts that three factions emerged, still exist today: a conservative group which seeks a return to the former, authoritarian structure; a moderate group that, "while they recognize that reform is necessary, feel that the current rate of reform is sufficient"; and a reformist group which advocates radical restructuring.<ref name="3factions">{{Cite web|url=http://www.reveal.org/abouticc/factions.html|title=Three Major Factions|accessdate=2007-07-09|publisher=REVEAL|year=2005 Sept|author=Lee, Chris}}</ref>

In the wake of these changes, some efforts are being made at reconciliation between the [[International Churches of Christ]] and the mainstream Churches of Christ. In March 2004, Abilene Christian University held the "Faithful Conversations" dialog between members of the Churches of Christ and International Churches of Christ. Those involved were able to apologize and initiate an environment conducive to building bridges. A few leaders of the Churches of Christ apologized for use of the word "cult" in reference to the International Churches of Christ. The International Churches of Christ leaders apologized for alienating the Churches of Christ and implying they were not Christians. Despite improvements in relations, there are still fundamental differences within the fellowship. Early 2005 saw a second set of dialogs with greater promise for both sides helping one another.  [[Harding University]] is contemplating a [[distance learning]] program geared toward those ministers who were trained in the International Churches of Christ.<ref>Robert Carrillo, [http://www.freewebs.com/sbeat/icoccocessay.htm "The Church of Christ and the [[International Churches of Christ]],"] ''Restoration Press''</ref>

Dunnavant, ''The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ'', Wm. B.

===Australia & New Zealand===
{{seealso|Churches of Christ in Australia}}
Historically, Restoration Movement groups from [[Great Britain]] were more influential than those from the United States in the early development of the movement in [[Australia]]. Churches of Christ grew up independently in several locations.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Australia"/>{{rp|47}} While early Churches of Christ in Australia saw [[creeds]] as divisive, towards the end of the nineteenth century they began viewing "summary statements of belief" as useful in tutoring second generation members and converts from other religious groups.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Australia"/>{{rp|50}}  The period from 1875 through 1910 also saw debates over the use of musical instruments in worship, Christian Endeavor Societies and Sunday Schools.  Ultimately, all three found general acceptance in the movement.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Australia"/>{{rp|51}} Currently, the Restoration Movement is not as divided in Australia as it is in the [[United States]].<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Australia">Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, ''The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, ISBN 0802838987, 9780802838988, 854 pages, entry on ''Australia, The Movement in''</ref>{{rp|53}} There have been strong ties with the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]], but many conservative ministers and congregations associate with the [[Independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ]] instead.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Australia"/>{{rp|53}}  Others have sought support from non-instrumental Churches of Christ, particularly those who felt that "conference" congregations had "departed from the restoration ideal".<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Australia"/>{{rp|53}}

===Canada===
A relatively small proportion of total membership come from [[Canada]].  A growing portion of the Canadian demographic is made up of [[immigrant]] members of the church.  This is partly the result of Canadian demographics as a whole, and partly due to decreased interest amongst late generation Canadians.<ref>Wayne Turner, [http://www.gospelherald.org/Magazine/2007/2007-02/Strangers.htm "The Strangers Among Us,"] ''Gospel Herald'', February 2007</ref>

===Great Britain===
Churches of Christ in [[Europe]] arose separately from the American Restoration Movement and during the 1840s onwards various movements came into fellowship. A group in Nottingham withdrew from the Scotch Baptist church in 1836 to form a Church of Christ.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Great Britain and Ireland">Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, ''The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, ISBN 0802838987, 9780802838988, 854 pages, entry on ''Great Britain and Ireland, Churches of Christ in''</ref>{{rp|369}}  James Wallis, a member of that group, founded a magazine named the ''British Millennial Harbinger'' in 1837.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Great Britain and Ireland"/>{{rp|369}}  In 1842 the first Cooperative Meeting of Churches of Christ in Great Britain was held in Edinburgh.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Great Britain and Ireland"/>{{rp|369}}  Approximately 50 congregations were involved, representing a membership of 1,600.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Great Britain and Ireland"/>{{rp|369}}  The name "Churches of Christ" was formally adopted at an annual meeting in 1870.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Great Britain and Ireland"/>{{rp|369}}  [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]] influenced the British Restoration Movement indirectly through his writings; he visited the Britain for several months in 1847, and "presided at the Second Cooperative Meeting of the British Churches at Chester".<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Great Britain and Ireland"/>{{rp|369}}  At that time the movement had grown to encompass 80 congregations with a total membership of 2,300.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Great Britain and Ireland"/>{{rp|369}}  Annual meetings were held after 1847.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Great Britain and Ireland"/>{{rp|369}}

The use of instrumental music in worship was not a source of division among the Churches of Christ in Great Britain before World War I.  More significant was the issue of [[pacifism]]; a national conference was established in 1916 for congregations that opposed the war.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Great Britain and Ireland"/>{{rp|371}}  A conference for "Old Paths" congregations was first held in 1924.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Great Britain and Ireland"/>{{rp|371}}  The issues involved included concern that the Christian Association was compromising traditional principles in seeking [[ecumenical]] ties with other organizations and a sense that it had abandoned Scripture as "an all-sufficient rule of faith and practice".<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Great Britain and Ireland"/>{{rp|371}}  Two "Old Paths" congregations withdrew from the Association in 1931; an additional two withdrew in 1934, and nineteen more withdrew between 1943 and 1947.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Great Britain and Ireland"/>{{rp|371}}

Membership declined rapidly during and after the First World War.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Great Britain and Ireland"/>{{rp|372}}<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Missions in Europe">Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, ''The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, ISBN 0802838987, 9780802838988, 854 pages, entry on ''Europe, Missions in''</ref>{{rp|312}}  The Association of Churches of Christ in Britain disbanded in 1980.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Great Britain and Ireland"/>{{rp|372}}<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Missions in Europe"/>{{rp|312}}  Most Association congregations (approximately 40) united with the [[United Reformed Church]] in 1981.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Great Britain and Ireland"/>{{rp|372}}<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Missions in Europe"/>{{rp|312}}  In the same year, twenty-four other congregations formed a Fellowship of Churches of Christ.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Great Britain and Ireland"/>{{rp|372}}  The Fellowship developed ties with the [[Independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ]] during the 1980s.<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Great Britain and Ireland"/>{{rp|372}}<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Missions in Europe"/>{{rp|312}}

The Fellowship of Churches of Christ and some Australian and New Zealand Churches advocate a "missional" emphasis with an ideal of "Five Fold Leadership". Many people in more traditional Churches of Christ see these groups as having more in common with [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] churches. The main publishing organs of traditional Churches of Christ in Britain are ''The Christian Worker'' magazine and the ''Scripture Standard'' magazine. A history of the Association of Churches of Christ, ''Let Sects and Parties Fall'', was written by David M Thompson.<ref>David M. Thompson, ''Let Sects and Parties Fall: A Short History of the Association of Churches of Christ in Great Britain and Ireland'', Berean Publishing Trust (Jan 1980), ISBN 978-0850500127, 160 pages</ref>
