'''Grob Aircraft''' is a [[Germany|German]] [[aircraft]] manufacturer, previously known as ''Grob Aerospace''. It has been manufacturing aircraft using [[carbon fiber reinforced polymer]] since the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3363309,00.html?maca=en-podcast_made-in-germany_en-2108-xml-mrss | title = One of the Last German Airplane Manufacturers&nbsp;<U+2014> Grob Aerospace | accessdate=2009-02-25}}</ref>

==History==
The company was founded in 1971 by Dr Burkhart Grob, son of Ernst Grob, who had started producing internal combustion engines in 1926 and later made other parts for the automobile industry. Grob Aerospace became involved in [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]] manufacture in 1971 when it was sub-contracted by [[Schempp-Hirth]] to build the [[Schempp-Hirth Standard Cirrus|Standard Cirrus]] under licence. Burkhart Grob was a power pilot and a glider pilot already.

Two hundred Standard Cirruses were built by Grob at its own Tussenhausen-Mattsies airfield between 1971 and 1975. In 1974 Grob decided to continue with glider production independently using its experience with fibre-composite construction. Instead of building competitive gliders, they decided to build for the club market at competitive prices. The result was the G-102 Astir. The two-seat G 103 Twin Astir followed shortly after.

In the late 1970s Grob also decided to build the G 109, the world's first production all-composite [[motor glider]] which was certified in 1981. This was following by the G 115 which was certified by the FAA in 1987. In the late 1980s the G 520 [[Egrett]]/STRATO 1 high-altitude aircraft was produced which established five world records. Glider production ceased in 1996 and production concentrated on powered aircraft.

The [[Grob G180 SPn]], six-passenger jet, first flew in 2005. The second prototype crashed shortly after takeoff on November 29, 2006 near the production plant in Germany. Chief test pilot [[G<U+00E9>rard Guillaumaud]], the aircraft's sole occupant, was killed.<ref name="FlighGlobal05Dec06">{{cite web|url = http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2006/12/05/210909/grob-resolute-after-crash-destroys-spn-prototype.html|title = Chief test pilot killed as aircraft comes down near factory during demonstration flight|accessdate = 2009-09-07|last = Sarsfield|first = Kate|authorlink = |year = 2006|month = December}}</ref>

===2008 insolvency===
On 18 August 2008, Grob Aerospace filed for insolvency, suspending their light-jet production and calling into question timely delivery of [[Bombardier Aerospace]]'s [[Learjet 85]] prototypes which Grob was contracted to build. The company was unable to find any investors for its SPn jet project. Most employees were released on 3 November 2008.<ref name="AWST19Aug08">{{cite web|url = http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=busav&id=news/GROB08198.xml&headline=Grob%20Aerospace%20Files%20For%20Insolvency|title = Grob Aerospace Files For Insolvency|accessdate = 2008-10-31|last = Collogan|first = David|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = August}}</ref><ref name="AOPA30Oct08">{{cite web|url = http://www.aopa.org/aircraft/articles/2008/081030industry.html|title = Credit crunch felt by GA manufacturers|accessdate = 2008-10-31|last = Marsh|first = Alton K.|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = October}}</ref>

Niall Olver, Grob's chief executive officer said:

{{cquote|This unfortunate situation has arisen fairly rapidly off the back of recent delays in the SPn program, resulting in commensurately increased cash requirement to see the aircraft through to certification. Our current loan provider has elected to discontinue support, with immediate effect.<ref name="AWST19Aug08"/> }}

On 16 December 2008 Grob insolvency administrator Dr. Michael Jaff<U+00E9> announced that two parties had expressed interest in taking over the insolvent company, [[Munich]] based [[H3 Aerospace]] and the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[Guizhou Aircraft Industry Corporation]]. Both companies offered about $4.5 million for Grob, with Guizhou also offering an additional $3.5 million for the SPn jet program.<ref name="AInOnline.com">{{cite web|url = http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/two-buyers-interested-in-acquiring-grob/|title = Two Buyers Interested in Acquiring Grob|accessdate = 2008-12-19|last = Stocker|first = Thomas|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = December}}</ref>

In January 2009 H3 Aerospace bought the training aircraft and support business of Grob Aerospace and renamed it '''Grob Aircraft AG'''. The training aircraft production, which had been halted in November 2008, was restarted in February 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=busav&id=news/GROB012809.xml | title = Grob Aerospace Buyer Found | accessdate=2009-02-25}}</ref><ref name="FlightGlobal25Mar09">{{cite web|url = http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/03/25/324272/spn-light-business-jet-nearer-to-resurrection.html|title = SPn light business jet nearer to resurrection |accessdate = 2009-03-13|last = Sarsfield|first = Kate|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = March}}</ref>
On April 2012 it was announced the Argentina's government controlled Aircraft Factory [[Fabrica Argentina de Aviones|FAdeA]] plans a production of 100 [[FMA IA 63 Pampa|IA-63 Pampa II]] training and combat aircraft at its plant in Cordoba in association with the German company Grob Aircraft AG. The Pampa II aircraft will have several pieces of its update version supplied by the German Aircraft factory.<ref>[http://en.mercopress.com/2012/04/10/argentine-factory-begins-production-of-pampa-training-aircraft-with-german-help Argentine factory begins production of Pampa training aircraft with German help], (April 10th 2012).</ref>

==SPn program==
Grob Aerospace's largest creditor did not approve the sale of the SPn to Guizhou Aircraft Industry Corporation and instead retained it. Niall Olver, Grob Aerospace's former CEO, was appointed by the creditor to find new investors to buy the SPn assets with the aim of restarting the program by June 2009. Olver indicated in March 2009 that the plan was to complete certification and commence production near the middle of 2012.<ref name="FlightGlobal25Mar09" />
