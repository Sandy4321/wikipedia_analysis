'''George Constantine''' ({{circa|1500}} &ndash; 1560) was a British priest who was an early [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and evangelical reformer.

==Life History==
Constantine was, by his own account, born around 1500, and in 1523 gained entry into [[Cambridge University]] to study for a Bachelor of Canon Law.<ref name=Venn>{{Venn|id=CNSN523G|name=Constantine, George}}</ref> He adopted the Protestant doctrine, and fled to [[Antwerp]] where he met and assisted both [[William Tyndale]] and [[George Joye]]. Here he helped to translate the [[New Testament]] into English, and compiled books denouncing the Catholic Church.<ref name="Lloyd1115">Lloyd (1958), pg 1115.</ref> Constantine later moved to Paris, where he studied [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] scriptures and began to smuggle banned literature into England. He was arrested in 1531 by Sir [[Thomas More]];<ref>[http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/16century/topic_3/biblburn.htm The Sixteenth Century: The Bible] The Norton Anthology of English Literature</ref> after revealing the names of some of his Protestant colleagues he escaped in December of the same year, returning to Antwerp. Constantine returned to England in 1536, following More's death, and entered the service of Sir [[Henry Norris (courtier)|Henry Norris]].<ref name="Lloyd1116">Lloyd (1958), pg 1116.</ref>

After Norris's death, Constantine was made the vicar of [[Llawhaden]] in [[Pembrokeshire]], but some unguarded remarks to [[John Barlow (diplomat)|John Barlow]] in 1539 led to his imprisonment by [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] in the [[Tower of London]].<ref name="Lloyd1116"/> By 1546, Constantine had been released from imprisonment, and had regained favour with the church. He became the registrar of [[St David's]] in [[Wales]], then gained the position of royal visitor of the [[Diocese of St David's|diocese]] in 1547, ascending to [[Archdeacon]] of [[Carmarthenshire]] and [[Prebendary]] of [[Llangammarch Wells|Llangamarch]] in 1549. Although Constantine was stripped of his registrarship and livings during [[Mary I of England|Mary's]] reign, he was back in favour by 1559 when he was appointed one of the visitors for the Western circuit of diocese. At last, in November 1559, he was made archdeacon of [[Brecon]] by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].<ref name="Lloyd1116"/>

Constantine married; his only surviving child became the first wife of [[Thomas Young (archbishop)|Thomas Younge]], Archbishop of York.<ref>Prior, Mary; ''Women in English Society, 1500-1800'', Routledge (1985), pg 98. ISBN 978-0415079013</ref>
