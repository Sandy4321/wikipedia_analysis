==Plot==
A number of burglaries by a cat burglar take place in Springfield, hitting even the [[Simpson family|Simpsons]]' house. Among the stolen items are Lisa's saxophone, Marge's pearl necklace, Bart's stamp collection, and the family [[TV]]. In response, the residents of Springfield arm themselves and install security devices. A neighborhood watch group is created, and the members elect Homer as their leader. The group patrols the streets, but its members break laws much more than they catch criminals, turning into [[vigilante]]s. When Homer is interviewed on news anchor [[Kent Brockman]]'s ''[[Smartline]]'', the cat burglar calls the show and informs Homer that he will steal the world's largest [[cubic zirconia]] from the Springfield museum.

Homer and his group begin guarding the museum. Grampa and his friends from the retirement home volunteer to help, but Homer tells them to leave because they are too old. A few minutes later, Homer sees a group of teenagers drinking beer. He leaves his post to stop them, but quickly ends up getting drunk with them instead. While Homer's guard is down, the cat burglar sneaks past and steals the zirconia. Homer is blamed and pelted with vegetables by the unforgiving townspeople. Later that day, Grampa stops by the Simpsons' house and tells everybody that he knows who the cat burglar is: a resident in the local retirement home named Molloy.

Homer captures Molloy at the retirement home, and the surprisingly amiable cat burglar returns the objects he stole. [[Chief Wiggum]] arrests him and he is imprisoned. While in his cell at the police station, Molloy casually mentions that he assumes Homer and the cops probably want to know where he hid all of his loot. This piques their interest, and Molloy tells them the stash is hidden under a giant "T" somewhere in Springfield. They all rush out of the station hoping to get the treasure for themselves. In a matter of minutes the entire town hears of the existence of Molloy's stash and almost everybody in Springfield is racing to get there first. After the residents get to the site and dig, they finally discover a box with a note inside. The note tells them that there is no treasure and that while they have been searching, Molloy has escaped from his cell. However,  several citizens continue to dig, convinced that a real treasure must be buried deeper.

The episode was written by [[John Swartzwelder]] and directed by [[Jim Reardon]]. [[New Zealand]] actor [[Sam Neill]] guest starred in the episode as Molloy, the cat burglar. Executive producer [[David Mirkin]] thought Neill, a big ''The Simpsons'' fan, was "lovely" to direct. Mirkin also said Neill was "really game" and did "a terrific job" on the episode.<ref name="Mirkin"/> Neill considers recording this episode to be a "high-point" of his career.<ref>{{cite news|title='Poetic Justice' premiere blocked|date=July 24, 1993 |work=The Cincinnati Post |page=2C}}</ref> One scene of the episode features Kent Brockman reporting on the burglaries. He says: "When cat burglaries start, can mass murders be far behind? This reporter isn't saying that the burglar is an inhuman monster like the Wolfman, but he very well could be. So, professor: would you say it's time for everyone to panic?", to which a "professor" replies: "Yes I would, Kent." Mirkin said this was a joke the staff enjoyed doing because it pointed out how negative and mean-spirited news broadcasts can be, and how they are seemingly "always trying to scare everybody" by creating panic and depression.<ref name="Mirkin">{{cite video | people=Mirkin, David|date=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer the Vigilante"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref name="Mirkin2">{{cite video | people=Mirkin, David|date=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer Loves Flanders"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought it was "a bit lacking in focus", but it contained "a number of satisfying set-pieces <U+2014> we like [[Professor Frink]]'s walking house security system <U+2014> and displays Wiggum at his all-time most useless."<ref name="BBC"/> DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: "After the many plots of the prior show, 'Vigilante' maintains a much tighter focus. It<U+2019>s not quite as wonderful an episode as its immediate predecessor, but it<U+2019>s strong nonetheless. Much of the humor comes from Homer<U+2019>s newfound power and abuse of it. If nothing else, it<U+2019>s a great program due to Homer<U+2019>s reaction to Lisa<U+2019>s jug playing."<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-24 |url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonfive.shtml |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season (1993)  |publisher=DVD Movie Guide |date=December 21, 2004 |author=Jacobson, Colin }}</ref> A reviewer for Currentfilm.com wrote: "While the episode seems to be a fan favorite, I think there's only a handful of funny bits scattered throughout the episode."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.currentfilm.com/dvdreviews5/simpsonss5dvd.html|title=DVD Review: Simpsons: Season 5|publisher=Currentfilm.com|accessdate=2009-03-31}}</ref> Les Winan of Box Office Prophets named "Homer the Vigilante", "[[Cape Feare]]", "[[Homer Goes to College]]", "[[$pringfield]]", and "[[Deep Space Homer]]" his favorite episodes of season five.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeprophets.com/column/index.cfm?columnID=8736|title=How to Spend $20|last=Winan|first=Les|date=December 28, 2004|publisher=Box Office Prophets|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> It was also the ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]'''s Mike Chapple's favorite episode of the season together with "[[Bart Gets an Elephant]]" and "[[Burns' Heir]]".<ref>{{cite news|title=DVD view|last=Chapple|first=Mike|date=April 1, 2005 |work=Liverpool Daily Post|pages=B4}}</ref> Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of B,<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-24 |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason5.php |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=February 23, 2005 |author=Bromley, Patrick }}</ref> and Bill Gibron of [[DVD Talk]] gave it a score of 4 out of 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/13784/simpsons-the-complete-fifth-season-the/|title=The Simpsons - The Complete Fifth Season|last=Gibron|first=Bill|date=December 23, 2004|publisher=[[DVD Talk]]|accessdate=2009-01-09}}</ref>
