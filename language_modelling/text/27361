==Post-election==

[[Georg Milbradt]] (CDU), losing his absolute majority, had to form a grand coalition with the SPD to remain in office as Prime Minister.


Notably, the far-right NPD received two more votes in the ballot for Prime Minister than it had members. It is presumed that two CDU Landtag members must have backed the NPD leadership.
