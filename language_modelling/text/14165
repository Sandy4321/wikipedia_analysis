'''''Stargate SG-1''''' (often abbreviated as '''SG-1''') is a [[science fiction]] [[television series]], part of the [[Stargate|Stargate franchise]]. It begins one year after the events of the 1994 science fiction film ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]''. It was produced in and around <!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: Before changing its location of production, please join the discussion on the Talk Page.

In the [[Stargate]] [[science fiction]] [[fictional universe|universe]], a network of ancient alien devices called [[Stargate (device)|Stargates]] connect the far reaches of the Milky Way galaxy, opening the door for near-instantaneous interstellar travel.<!-- The workings of the Stargate should be detailed elsewhere --> ''Stargate SG-1'' chronicles the exploits of [[SG-1]], the "flagship team" of at least 25 teams who explore the galaxy and defend Earth against alien threats such as the [[Goa'uld]], [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicators]] and later the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]].

The series is currently broadcast in several countries around the world; in some places, such as [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Japan]], [[Latin America]] and [[Australia]], the series is broadcast in [[High-definition television|HD]]. 

In 2007, after completion of the series run, ''Stargate SG-1'' was named as number 28 on ''[[TV Guide]]'''s list of "The 30 Top Cult Shows Ever".<ref name="top cult">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/top-cult-shows/070629-01|title=TV Guide Names the Top Cult Shows Ever|work=TVGuide|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref>

==Production==
Developed for television by [[Jonathan Glassner]] and [[Brad Wright]], ''Stargate SG-1'' was produced by [[MGM]] and filmed at [[Bridge Studios]] in [[Vancouver]]. The first episode was broadcast on [[July 27]], [[1997 in television|1997]] on [[Showtime]] in the US and [[December 3]], [[1997]] on the [[Seven Network]] in Australia. Showtime produced and aired the show's first five seasons. Beginning with season six, it was produced and aired by the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]]. A [[spin-off]] series, ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', began airing in 2004. The two shows ran in tandem for three years, with plots occasionally interconnected and simultaneous story timelines.

''Stargate SG-1'' became the longest-running North American science fiction series on television, surpassing the nine seasons and 202 episodes of the ''[[The X-Files]]''. It is also listed in the 2007 [[Guinness World Records]] as the "longest-running science fiction show (consecutive)";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5390372.stm|title= Dr Who 'longest-running sci-fi'|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2006-09-29}}</ref> ''[[Doctor Who]]'' fans dispute this claim, as 695 episodes of the British show were produced and shown consecutively between 1963 and 1989.<ref name="record">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2006/09/23/36558.shtml |title=Record breaker?|work=BBC News|accessdate=2006-09-28}}</ref>

On August 21, 2006, the Sci Fi Channel announced that it would not be renewing the show for an eleventh season; however, executive producer [[Robert C. Cooper]] stated that ''Stargate SG-1''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s story will continue in a yet-to-be-announced form.<ref name="coopersg1">{{cite web |author=Darren Sumner |authorlink=GateWorld |publisher=GateWorld |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/08/cooper_isg-1i_will_go_on.shtml |title=Cooper: SG-1 will go on|date=[[2006-08-21]]|accessdate=2006-08-21}}</ref> [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] announced that they are very keen to carry on the ''Stargate SG-1'' story, and that they "intend to vigorously find a way to extend the franchise". Two ''Stargate'' films are currently planned, a continuation of the ''Stargate SG-1'' story lines ''(see [[List of Stargate SG-1 episodes#Movies|List of Stargate SG-1 episodes]])''. The last day of shooting for season ten was on October 5, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gateworld.net/blogs/bartok/2006/10/last-day-of-shooting-wow.shtml|title= Last day of shooting wow| publisher=Ivon Bartok| work=GateWorld| accessdate=2006-10-05}}</ref> The final episode "[[Unending]]" was first broadcast by [[Sky One]] in the UK on March 13, 2007, and was later aired by the Sci Fi Channel in the United States on June 22, 2007.

In December, 2006, there were suggestions that a third Stargate series was being developed by the team behind ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''Stargate Atlantis''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/12/exclusive_third_istargatei_serie.shtml|title= Exclusive: Third Stargate series in development| publisher=Darren Sumner| work=GateWorld| accessdate=2006-12-17}}</ref> The working title of this series is ''[[Stargate Universe]]''.

===End of the series===
On August 21, 2006, the Sci Fi Channel confirmed that ''Stargate SG-1'' was not being renewed for an 11th season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=2&id=37607|title=SG-1 Ends Run; Atlantis Back| publisher=GateWorld| date=[[2006-08-22]]| accessdate=2006-08-27}}</ref> However, Executive producer [[Robert C. Cooper]] told [[GateWorld]] that they are hard at work looking for a new outlet for the story to continue.

{{cquote|As far as the future, I can't comment yet because nothing has been confirmed", Cooper said. "What we want to emphasize is that the franchise is not dying. ''SG-1'' will go on in some way. We're just not ready to announce how." Cooper also emphasizes that, though emotions are running high among Stargate fans who have just learned the news, it is important to keep the show's ratings strong throughout the remainder of its run on Sci Fi. "What's most important is that fans don't take out their frustration with SciFi by not watching", he said. "In fact, what they need to do is watch both ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis LIVE'' and make sure the ratings stay strong. That helps prove to other outlets that might be interested in ''SG-1'' that the show is still as strong as we think it is".<ref name="coopersg1" />}}

Mark Stern, executive VP of original programming for the Sci Fi Channel stated that the decision "was not a ratings-based decision", adding that the production staff has been given enough time to tie up all the loose ends and to create a good ending for the show. Stern has also said that SciFi plans to use some ''SG-1'' members on the still-continuing spin-off ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=John Dempsey, Ben Fritz|authorlink=|work=Variety News|publisher=Reed Business Information|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117948764?categoryid=14&cs=1|title=Sci Fi's 'Stargate' swinging closed|date=[[2006-08-21]]|accessdate=2006-08-27}}</ref> MGM, the rights holder, has expressed a desire to continue ''SG-1'' through another outlet, suggesting that another network may pick up the series. This means that the series has not actually finished, but is simply on hold. MGM announced that they wish to continue the SG-1 series, either as a movie, mini-series, or an eleventh season on some other network, suggesting that [[G4 (TV channel)|G4]] and Showtime have presented interest in such an option. However, the Sci Fi Channel is attempting to block the action, citing their contract with MGM.<ref>{{cite web|author=Darren Sumner|authorlink=GateWorld|publisher=GateWorld|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/08/mgm_considers_isg-1is_future.shtml|title= MGM considers SG-1's future|date=[[2006-08-26]]|accessdate=2006-08-27}}</ref>
On Tuesday, September 26, 2006, [[GateWorld]] released news that [[IGN]] had reported that there will not be an eleventh season, but rather that there will be a series of SG-1 TV movies; the report cites an unnamed cast member.<ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/09/studio_planning_isg-1i_tv_movies.shtml Studio planning SG-1 TV movies?], by Darren Sumner, GateWorld, [[September 26]][[2006]]</ref>

On December 14,2006, production sources informed GateWorld that a new series is in the idea stage, and is being actively worked on by the same creative minds behind ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''Stargate Atlantis''. There have not been any plot lines released as of this time. Considering previous releases of ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'', the release date should not be expected until at least 2008.<ref name="Ark">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/newsitem.cfm?NewsID=7717|title=Stargate SG-1 - Yes, There's More!

On December 20, 2006, verified reports from GateWorld confirmed the production of two movies, with filming expected to begin in late April 2007. The regular cast of ''Stargate'' will be part of the cast. Executive producer Robert C. Cooper will both write and direct the first film, to be named ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]''. The first movie "has to do with wrapping up the Ori storyline, which is the storyline that has taken prominence for the last two years of the show," said cast member Michael Shanks. The second movie, called ''[[Stargate: Continuum]]'', started shooting June 1, 2007. Executive producer Brad Wright will write the second film, with Martin Wood directing. That story is a [[time travel]] story taking SG-1 to the past. "It has something to do with our main villain Ba'al ([[Cliff Simon]]) doing something in the past," Shanks said. "He basically finds a way to lift the Stargate from Earth so the Stargate Program never happens, and I imagine the characters will have to go through some process to reset the clock and fix everything".

On December 22, 2006, GateWorld reported that with MGM beginning production of the first [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] movie, MGM and the show's [[Vancouver]]-based producers are no longer pursuing an eleventh season.

{{see also|Differences between Stargate and Stargate SG-1}}

''Stargate SG-1'' follows and expands upon the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] mythologies presented in [[Stargate (film)|''Stargate'']]. In the Stargate universe, the human race on Earth, known to the rest of the galaxy as the [[Tau'ri]], were descendants of the [[Ancients (Stargate)|Ancients]], a race of highly evolved beings. [[Earth]] was believed to be the first planet where humans existed in this galaxy. Humans were enslaved and transported to other habitable planets by the [[Goa'uld]] such as [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]] and [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]]. For millennia, the Goa'uld harvested humanity, heavily influencing and spreading human cultures. As a result, Earth cultures such as those of the [[Aztec]]s, [[Maya civilization|Mayans]], [[Briton]]s, the [[Nordic countries|Norse]], [[Mongol]]s, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]s and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s are found throughout the known habitable planets of the galaxy. Many well-known mythical locations such as [[Avalon (Stargate SG-1)|Avalon]], [[Camelot (Stargate SG-1)|Camelot]] and [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]] are found, or have at one time existed. 

The series explores both long story arcs (discussed below) as well as more contained one-episode stories. Often these shorter stories will detail SG-1's exploits on a previously unexplored planet.

Presently, the Earth Stargate (found at a dig site near Giza in 1928) is housed in a [[Classified Information|top-secret]] [[United States|U.S.]] [[military base]] known as the [[Stargate Command|SGC]] (Stargate Command) underneath [[Cheyenne Mountain]]. [[Jack O'Neill|Col. Jack O'Neill]] ([[Richard Dean Anderson]]), [[Daniel Jackson|Dr. Daniel Jackson]] ([[Michael Shanks]]), [[Samantha Carter|Cpt. Samantha Carter]] ([[Amanda Tapping]]) and [[Teal'c]] ([[Christopher Judge]]) compose the original SG-1 team. Along with 24 other SG teams, they venture to distant planets exploring the galaxy and searching for defenses from the [[Goa'uld]], in the forms of technology and alliances with friendly advanced races. Later in the series, some members of SG-1 leave and new members join, such as [[Jonas Quinn]] ([[Corin Nemec]]), [[Cameron Mitchell (Stargate)|Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell]] ([[Ben Browder]]) and [[Vala Mal Doran]] ([[Claudia Black]])

The parasitic [[Goa'uld]] use advanced technology to cast themselves as [[gods]] and are bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship. Throughout the first eight seasons, the [[Goa'uld]] are the primary antagonists. They are a race of highly intelligent, ruthless snake-like alien parasites capable of invading and controlling the bodies of other species, including humans. The original arch-enemy from this race is the [[System Lord]] [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]] ([[Peter Williams (actor)|Peter Williams]]). Other System Lords, such as [[Baal (Stargate)|Ba'al]] and [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]], play pivotal roles in the later seasons. In the third season, the [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicator]]s are also introduced. The Replicators are mechanical bugs that feed on metals to "replicate" and create more bugs. Enemy of the [[Asgard]], they are the main reason why the Asgard cannot eliminate the Goa'uld threat. In the ninth season a new villain emerges, [[Ori (Stargate)|the Ori]]. The Ori are advanced beings with unfathomable technology from another galaxy, also bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship. The introduction of the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] accompanies a departure from the primary focus on [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] mythology into an exploration of the [[Arthurian]] mythology surrounding the Ori, their followers, and their enemies <U+2014> the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]]. Both Ancients and Ori are Ascended Beings, meaning that they have 'ascended' to a higher plane of existence, giving them extraordinary powers.
===Goa'uld arc===
[[Image:stargatesg1season1title.jpg|thumb|"[[Children of the Gods (Stargate SG-1)|Pilot]]" intertitle]] 
{{main|Goa'uld|Stargate SG-1 (season 1)|Stargate SG-1 (season 2)|Stargate SG-1 (season 3)|Stargate SG-1 (season 4)}}
When Apophis attacks Earth at the beginning of the series (which is set one year after the events of the [[Stargate (film)|original film]]), the [[Stargate Command|SGC]] military base is brought back into action. The [[SG teams]] are created<U+2014>spearheaded by [[SG-1]]<U+2014>to help defend Earth from the new threat. It is quickly revealed that Apophis is but one of many [[Goa'uld]] [[System Lord]]s who battle for power in the galaxy. The Stargate itself is also revealed to connect not only Earth and [[Abydos (Stargate)|Abydos]], but is one of many gates forming an enormous network connecting countless planets. The Goa'uld are parasitic beings that take control of other races, usually humans, and use them as unwilling hosts. The System Lords possess interstellar pyramid-shaped warships and vast armies of foot soldiers. The bulk of these forces are modified humans known as [[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]].

In the first episode the lives of the SG-1 team are saved by a Jaffa, [[Teal'c]], the First Prime of Apophis, who defects hoping the [[Tau'ri]] (Earth humans) can defeat the Goa'uld, freeing the Jaffa. Earth becomes exposed as a threat to Goa'uld power and comes under attack.

SG-1 and the SGC forge several alliances with other races in the galaxy, among them the [[Tok'ra]]. The Tok'ra are the same species as the Goa'uld, but opposed to the System Lords. They blend with their hosts voluntarily to ''share'' their bodies. Other races depicted include the [[Tollan (Stargate)|Tollan]], as well as other advanced human civilizations. They also encounter races that have been surviving in the galaxy for millennia, such as the [[Nox (Stargate)|Nox]], the Asgard, and the remnants of an extinct race that comes to be known as the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]]. It is later discovered that the Ancients had been the most advanced race in history, and were the builders of the Stargates. It is also revealed that Earth was the homeworld of the Ancients.

There is a constant attempt by forces on Earth to take control of the Stargate. In particular, rogue [[NID (Stargate)|NID]] agents, which eventually become the elite syndicate known as [[Trust (Stargate)|The Trust]], constantly try to steal the Stargate or use alien technology for its own ends. The political powers on Earth are often at odds over the Stargate, once the program is revealed to ambassadors from the major powers of Earth.

In season three, another threat arises<U+2014>a race of non-sentient machines called Replicators. These Replicators have rarely posed a direct threat to the Milky Way galaxy, but are revealed as being on the verge of wiping out the Asgard.

Season four premieres focusing on the war against the Replicators. The show begins to move away from its Goa'uld-orientated roots, instead focusing on stand-alone episodes and exploring alternative concepts for episodes. Throughout the season, SG-1 encounters everything from genocidal civilizations, to advanced strength-enhancing gauntlets, to a newly recurring species, the [[Unas (Stargate)|Unas]]. The season ends with a major battle against the Goa'uld System Lord Apophis.

===Anubis arc===
[[Image:Stargate SG-1 Season 8 Title.jpg|thumb|right|[[List of Stargate SG-1 episodes|Season 6]]<U+2013>8's intertitle]]
{{main|Anubis (Stargate)|Stargate SG-1 (season 5)|Stargate SG-1 (season 6)|Stargate SG-1 (season 7)|Stargate SG-1 (season 8)}}
After Apophis is defeated at the beginning of season five, another Goa'uld System Lord takes his place as the main villain, Anubis. Anubis has much knowledge of the Ancients and their technology. The theme of [[Ascension (Stargate)|Ascension]] is introduced fully, explaining that the Ancients survived extinction by Ascending to a [[Plane (metaphysics)|higher plane of existence]]. Anubis tried to do this as well, to harvest the vast knowledge and power in that plane, but was cast down, leaving him in a dangerous, half-Ascended state. Anubis gains great power by using Ancient technology and stealing Asgard technology. [[Daniel Jackson]] sacrifices his life to prevent disaster on another planet. With help from [[Oma Desala]], an ascended Ancient, Daniel too ascends to the higher plane of existence.

In season six, [[Jonas Quinn]] joins the team, filling Daniel's place, as he is now engaged in cosmic affairs on a higher plane. Occasionally, Daniel appears to his friends to help them out. He only appears to them individually, often causing them to think that they are hallucinating. In the season six finale, Anubis threatens to destroy Abydos, the planet most dear to Daniel apart from Earth, and Daniel promises to stop Anubis.

Daniel is ultimately unable to use his Ascended powers to keep Anubis from destroying Abydos; it is revealed in Season 8 that, as Oma Desala's punishment for helping Anubis ascend, it has been prohibited that any ascended being take action against him--Oma must suffer by seeing innocents come to harm because of her interventions in the mortal plane. Daniel's transgression results in his return to the mortal plane of existence, where he rejoins SG-1. Soon after Daniel's return, Jonas Quinn is permitted by his world to return home, and he leaves the SGC. Throughout season seven, Anubis consolidates his power by wiping out other System Lords, while Daniel and the SGC search for the [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Lost City of the Ancients]] where powerful technology capable of defeating Anubis is believed to be located. In the season seven finale, an Ancient outpost is located in Antarctica, and O'Neill is able to use the weapons there to annihilate Anubis' entire fleet.

In season eight, the System Lord [[Ba'al (Stargate)|Ba'al]] subsumes much of Anubis's power, but Anubis is discovered still alive, due to his half-Ascended state. He eventually comes to rule secretly over Ba'al as well. Alongside this, the Replicators escape and begin to conquer the System Lords. A human-form Replicator created in the image of [[Samantha Carter]] ("[[RepliCarter]]") becomes the most powerful force in the galaxy.

Towards the end of season eight, Anubis seeks to destroy all life in the galaxy using the [[Dakara Superweapon]], so he can remake it as he sees fit. However, SG-1 reaches the weapon first and adjusts it to destroy all Replicators throughout the galaxy. They achieve this end, but not before Daniel is killed by RepliCarter. He finds himself returned to the Ascended plane (again with Oma's assistance), where he learns that Oma also helped Anubis to Ascend. Daniel is able to convince Oma of the danger posed by Anubis, and she stops him once and for all by engaging him in an eternal stalemated battle on the Ascended plane, thus preventing him from acting on the mortal plane. Daniel then returns to the mortal plane, arriving at the SGC. Ba'al is forced by the Jaffa Rebellion to flee. The System Lords have been decimated, the Replicators annihilated, and the Jaffa have won their freedom.

===Ori arc===
[[Image:Stargate SG-1 Season 9 Short Title.jpg|thumb|[[List of Stargate SG-1 episodes|Season 9]]'s 10-second intertitle]]
[[Image:Stargate SG-1 Season 9 Title.jpg|thumb|[[List of Stargate SG-1 episodes|Season 9]]'s extended intertitle]]
{{main|Ori (Stargate)|Stargate SG-1 (season 9)|Stargate SG-1 (season 10)|Stargate: The Ark of Truth}}
In season nine, [[Jack O'Neill]] is promoted to the rank of [[Major General]] and leaves the SGC to replace Retired [[George Hammond|Major General Hammond]] as the new Commander for [[Department of Homeworld Security]], to be replaced as base commander by [[Hank Landry (Stargate)|Major General Hank Landry]] ([[Beau Bridges]]). [[Cameron Mitchell (Stargate)|Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell]] ([[Ben Browder]]) also joins the SGC as the commanding officer of SG-1. The SGC discovers that Ba'al has fled to Earth and is rebuilding his power from there, while the Goa'uld have infiltrated The Trust.

An accidental visit to a distant galaxy by Daniel Jackson and [[Vala Mal Doran]] draws the attention of the Ori to the existence of sentient life in the Milky Way. The Ori influence the mortal plane through commanding [[Prior (Stargate)|Priors]], mortals they evolved and enhanced with supernatural powers. The Priors spread and enforce a religion called [[Origin (Stargate)|Origin]]. Followers of the religion are promised Ascension (a promise later learned to be false), and unknowingly augment the power of the Ori through the act of worship. They begin to make incursions into the Milky Way, with the ultimate goal of converting all sentient species and destroying the Ancients.

When SG-1 learns that [[Moros (Stargate)|Merlin]], a formerly Ascended Ancient and founder of the Arthurian legends, had been secretly working on [[Ancient technology in Stargate#Holy Grail|a weapon]] to incapacitate or destroy Ascended beings as a means of defense against the Ori, they travel to the planet where he is believed to have left it. There they find a village, Camelot, with a [[King Arthur|sword in a stone]] and discover the "weapon" is no less than the origin of the [[Holy Grail]] myth, and is long lost. The Ori attempt to establish a beachhead in the Milky Way galaxy by creating a giant Supergate through which they launch their crusade. Vala is accidentally transported to the Ori galaxy, where she finds herself pregnant with a child. The Ori manage to open a [[Supergate (Stargate)|Supergate]] into the Milky Way and send four [[Ori battlecruiser]]s to begin their evangelical crusade; they effortlessly wipe out the combined fleet of [[Tau'ri|Earth]], Jaffa, Asgard, and [[Lucian Alliance]] ships.

In season ten, [[Adria (Stargate)|Adria]], the daughter of Vala, is born and ages rapidly. She is the [[Orici (Stargate)|Orici]], leader of Ori forces in the Milky Way. SG-1 continues the search for Merlin's anti-ascended-being weapon, the [[Sangraal (Stargate)|Sangraal]] (Holy Grail). However, they must now contend with Ba'al and his [[cloning|clones]], who are attempting to find and use the weapon for their own purposes.

Following a visit to [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]], Daniel learns from [[Ancient characters in Stargate#Ganos Lal/Morgan le Fay|Morgan Le Fay]] of two planets that may harbor the weapon. The Jaffa use the [[Dakara Superweapon]] to wipe out the crew of an Ori ship, allowing its capture, but Adria survives the assault and destroys the weapon at Dakara. SG-1 travels to the planet where they believe the Sangraal is kept, and proves their worthiness to possess it through a series of tests, culminating with a battle with a dragon. Upon passing the tests, they are transported to Merlin's laboratory; Merlin transfers his consciousness into Daniel, and he begins constructing the Sangraal, but Adria interrupts and captures Daniel. Mitchell and Carter successfully transfer an entire village out-of-phase, protecting them from the Ori. Daniel becomes a Prior so he can send a ship with the Anti-Ori device through the Super-gate into the Ori galaxy. [[Langara (Stargate)|Langara]], home world of Jonas Quinn, falls to the Ori. SG-1 visits the Pegasus galaxy and Atlantis for the first time (though [[Teal'c]] does not make the journey), and conducts its first joint mission with Atlantis. The 200th episode was aired during this season. 

There are still several story-arcs that were not concluded at the end of the series, including the Ori, Ba'al, the Lucian Alliance, the Goa'uld infiltration of the Trust, and the state of the Jaffa Nation. The upcoming DVD movies will likely wrap these up.

{{main|Stargate literature#Stargate SG-1|Stargate Comics}}

Several novels have been published based in ''Stargate SG-1''. From 1999 to 2001, [[ROC (publisher)|ROC]] published four novels written by [[Ashley McConnell]]. In 2004, [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[Fandemonium|Fandemonium Press]] started a new series of licensed tie-in novels based on ''Stargate SG-1''. Due to a (now expired) conflict with ROC's license, these books were available in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]], but unavailable in the [[US]] until 2006.

The official ''Stargate Magazine'', produced by Titan Publishing, began publishing short stories written by Fandemonium authors in their 8th issue. The stories alternate between both ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis''.

A series of comics has also been published by [[Avatar Press]].

===DVD releases===
{{Stargate DVD Dates|SG1}}
''Stargate SG-1'' was first released on [[DVD]] in some Europe nations in volumes of four (sometimes three or two) episodes each, beginning with "The Best of Season 1" as Volume 1 on [[January 14]], [[2000]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Season 2, beginning with Volume 2, was composed of six volumes, as would all later season except Season 10 (five discs). [[MGM Home Entertainment]] (Europe) later in 2002 to release complete Season box-sets, as well as continuing with the volume releases. The Season 2 and Season 8 box sets have some episodes in an order different to their originally airing order. British complete Season box-sets are generally released half a year after the release of volumes. According to Gord Lacey at tvshowsondvd.com the release of Stargate SG-1 Season 9 was being held up due to the fact that MGM is changing its home distribution company from Sony to Fox.{{fact|date=February 2008}} 

In the United States (Region 1), Seasons 1 through 8 were originally released in boxsets that contained five discs in [[amaray]] cases. On [[April 3]] [[2006]], Sony Home Entertainment (US) announced that they would be re-releasing Seasons 1 - 8 of Stargate SG-1 in a reduced boxset size like that of Season 1 of Stargate Atlantis. The box set releases in [[Region 4]] followed the box art and amaray case style of the Region 1 releases. 
	
MGM announced in July 2007 that a complete series set for ''Stargate SG-1'' is in the works to be released on October 9. The set includes all 50 discs from the 10 seasons of Stargate SG-1, plus 4 bonus discs filled with content mot part of the original sets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/newsitem.cfm?NewsID=7626 |title=Stargate SG-1 - Complete series set coming in October |date=[[July 9]], [[2007]] |publisher=tvshowsondvd.com |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> The set includes all of SCI FI Channel's annual behind-the-scenes specials, never-before-seen video diaries and installments of the SG-1 Directors Series, new featurettes produced specifically for this release, and more.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2007/08/bonus_features_for_isg-1_complet.shtml |title=Bonus features for SG-1: Complete Series DVDs |date=[[August 3]], [[2007]] |publisher=gateworld.net |accessdate=2007-08-08}}</ref> The Complete Series of ''Stargate SG-1'' was released in Region 2 format on [[December 3]], [[2007]].

==Themes==
Episodes frequently open with SG-1 exploring a new planet for potential technology and allies. Upon discovery of civilized settlements Daniel Jackson, the [[archeology|archaeologist]] and [[history|historian]], often takes further interest in [[anthropology]], alien [[society]], [[culture]], and even [[morality|moral]] issues encountered. The philosophical and sociological differences between cultures are explored through SG-1's journeys. See: [[Emancipation (Stargate SG-1)|women's rights]], [[The Broca Divide (Stargate SG-1)|treatment of the sick]], [[The First Commandment (Stargate SG-1)|megalomania]], [[Cor-ai (Stargate SG-1)|following orders]], [[Past and Present (Stargate SG-1)|ethical dilemmas]], [[Pretense (Stargate SG-1)|moral relativism]], [[The Other Side (Stargate SG-1)|eugenics]], [[Scorched Earth (Stargate SG-1)|indigenous people]], [[mind control]] and [[Red Sky (Stargate SG-1)|responsibility]].
    
Human curiosity is often depicted as a double edged sword, and major events<U+2014>including the introduction of new villains<U+2014>often result from this:    
*After ignoring it for almost five thousand years, the Goa'uld come to realize Earth is a threat only after humanity reactivates the Stargate and defeat the System Lord [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]].   
*The [[Replicators]] are a product of an [[android]] who was created by a human-like scientist.   
*The Ori become aware of the Milky Way galaxy after Daniel Jackson and Vala Mal Doran activate an Ancient communication device that sends their consciousnesses to the Ori galaxy.   
*Physical and biological threats to Earth are repeatedly brought through the gate.   
See: [[Thor's Hammer (Stargate SG-1)|search for allies]], [[There but for the Grace of God|warning]], [[Message in a Bottle (Stargate SG-1)|curiosity]], [[One False Step (Stargate SG-1)|inadvertent damage]], [[Foothold (Stargate SG-1)|infiltration]], and [[2001 (Stargate SG-1)|allies]]. 
{{see also|Stargate Atlantis}}   
   
The series frequently references other television and film productions [http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1 for example]: ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]''. A recurring motif is the way in which human characters from Earth speak in naturalistic, everyday language, while most characters from other planets use a more eloquent, archaic variant of English. This is also present in ''Stargate Atlantis'' and is typically played for humor, especially when characters such as Teal'c attempt to use human slang terms. There are, however, exceptions to this rule such as Jonas Quinn, Vala Mal Doran, and [[Ronon Dex]] (from ''Stargate Atlantis'').   
   
The decade-old show remains popular; in 2004, ''[[TV Guide]]'' suggested that its popularity may be exceeding that of the ''Star Trek'' franchise. Testifying to its vigor, ''Stargate SG-1'' broke [[Nielsen Ratings]] records for the U.S. [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci-Fi Channel]] throughout its eighth season. Although Richard Dean Anderson departed as a regular after season eight, he made guest appearances in several episodes of seasons nine and ten of SG-1 and season three of ''Stargate Atlantis''.

'''Stargate and the military'''<br />
The [[United States Air Force|USAF]] cooperates closely with the producers of the program. Two successive [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chiefs of Staff of the USAF]], Generals [[Michael E. Ryan]] and [[John P. Jumper]], have appeared in the show, playing themselves. Ryan appeared in the episode "[[Prodigy (Stargate SG-1)|Prodigy]]" because of his fascination with science fiction, especially space exploration. Jumper made a cameo appearance in "[[Lost City (Stargate SG-1)|Lost City]]", the episode that was originally slated to be the show's last. The [[Air Force Association]] recognized Richard Dean Anderson at its 57th annual dinner on September 14, 2004 for his work as actor and executive producer of the show, and "for the show's continuous positive depiction of the Air Force".<ref name="air force press release">{{cite web |author=Doug Thar|authorlink=|work=|publisher=Air Force Link |url=http://www.af.mil/pressreleases/release.asp?storyID=123008593 |title=Air Force to honor actor, producer|date=[[2004-09-09]]|accessdate=2006-08-27}}</ref> Many of the extras portraying US Air Force personnel are in fact real US Air Force personnel.<ref name="air force press release"/>

'''Fictional universe'''<br />
''SG-1'' has a rich backdrop of aliens, planets and technology. For more information, see the relevant articles:
*[[Aliens in Stargate]]
*[[Technology in Stargate]]
*[[Fictional materials in the Stargate universe|Elements in Stargate]]
*[[Planets in Stargate]]
*[[Human civilizations in Stargate SG-1]]
*[[Timeline of Stargate]]

==Allusions==
* In "[[Children of the Gods (Stargate SG-1)|Children of the Gods]]", the pilot episode for the series, when Samantha Carter sees a [[Dial-Home Device|DHD]] for the first time, she comments on how it took "fifteen years and three supercomputers to [[MacGyver#MacGyverisms|MacGyver]] a system for the gate on Earth." This is a reference to Anderson's well-known portrayal of the television character [[MacGyver]].
{{wikiquote|Stargate_SG-1#Oz_references|Oz references in Stargate SG-1}} 
* Throughout the show, there are many references to ''The Wizard of Oz'', mainly by Col. O'Neill, as well as many references to ''The Simpsons'' as Jack O'Neill's favorite television series<U+2014>it is, in fact, Richard Dean Anderson's as well.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} In the season eight episode, "[[Citizen Joe]]", [[Dan Castellaneta]], the voice of [[Homer Simpson]], made a guest appearance as Joe Spencer. In turn, Richard Dean Anderson later made a guest appearance on ''The Simpsons'' in the seventeenth season episode ''[[Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore]]'' as himself.
* In the season one episode "[[Politics (Stargate SG-1)|Politics]]," Daniel Jackson facetiously suggests that they can stop the Goa'uld invasion by infecting their mother ship with a computer virus, poking fun at the movie ''[[Independence Day (film)|Independence Day]]'', which was written and produced by [[Dean Devlin]] and [[Roland Emmerich]], the writers of the film ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]''.
