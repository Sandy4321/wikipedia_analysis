== Biography and early research work ==

Yuri Belousov was born in a [[Ural (region)|Ural]] town of [[Troitsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast]] in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]]. His father<U+2019>s family began as Ukrainian peasants (original name was [[Bilous]]) from [[Poltava Governorate]] who arrived in Ural, Russia, in the early 20th century to receive a portion of land, promised by the [[Stolypin reform]].  His maternal grandfather Gennady Beketov, a descendant of [[Volga Tatars]] following the [[October Revolution]], was the first director one a Soviet bank in Saratov Region (now [[Saratov Oblast]]). After his death in 1921, his family moved to Ural.

In 1964, Yuri entered the Ural Polytechnic Institute (later [[Ural State Technical University]] (USTU)), [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] (now Yekaterinburg) in the department of Glass Technology.  After graduation, continued his postgraduate studies there. In 1974, he defended his doctoral thesis in the field of glass ceramics made of industrial [[slag]]s. In 1975, he started to work in one of the Research Institutes of Ural where successfully developed [http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01398332 thermal shock resistance glazes for carbon [[refractories|refractory]]].<ref name="Yu. L. Belousov, V. G. Sivash etc. Glaze for carbon-containing refractories / Refractories and Industrial Ceramics.

Sivash etc. Glaze for carbon-containing refractories / Refractories and Industrial Ceramics.

In 1978, his research was documented in a film by [[Sverdlovsk Film Studio]].

In the end of 70s, he accepted an offer on work by [[Vilen Ivakhnyuk]], an internationally recognized researcher, who made a scientific discovery, a founder and the first director of Belgorod Technological Institute of Constructional Materials (former BTISM), now [http://en.bstu.ru/Science Belgorod Shukhov University].

== Main achievements and inventions ==

While working in the institute in collaboration with Leningrad<U+2019>s researcher O.V. Mazurin, Yu. Belousov wrote the book [http://zapretuma.ru/raznoe/2387-mazurin-ov-belousov-yul-otjig-i-zakalka-stekla-uchebnoe-posobie.html The Annealing and Tempering of Glass], a popular and famous manual among engineers.  This book, devoted to a new method of glass treatment, became a respected reference guide for specialists and researchers in other related industries.
Based on this method, in 1988, Yu. Belousov, O.V. Mazurin and others developed USSR<U+2019>s first technology of a glass dust-free method of sealing glass ampoules, which significantly decreased contamination in medicinal ampouled preparations.  This invention was first introduced at one of the Soviet biopharmaceutical plants currently belonging to the Russian concern [http://www.veropharm.ru/eng/ VEROPHARM].

By the end of 80s, Yuri Belousov and his colleagues resolved an issue of exploding  [http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00678253 glass sparkling wine bottles] which had caused serious lacerations to workers in wine bottling facilities in Ukraine.   
 
Yu. Belousov<U+2019>s main achievement was development a method of calculating the viscosity of glassy melts based on known equations of viscosity. Before anyone else, Yu. Belousov gathered, described and compiled a data base of viscosity values of glasses and slags.  Then, using [[Arrhenius equation]], he developed the basic principles and a formulaic calculation algorithm of the viscosity of melts, which provided a fairly precise measurement.  The method is based on the theoretical viscosity values of melts of binary, ternary, quaternary and more complex oxide [[phase diagram]]s of the [[silicate]] systems. It allowed to avoid the current, expensive processes for determining viscosity in practice.
 
Under his guidance, his post-graduate students prepared several Ph.D. theses, three of which were defended after his death.

Yuri Belousov died in 2000 in the age of 54 due to poor health.

In recognition of his great contribution to the technology of Silicate materials field, in 1983, Yuri Belousov was awarded the Silver Medal of the main Soviet state exhibition [[VDNKh (Russia)]], the Exhibition of Achievements of the People's Economy.

His daughter followed his steps: she became a professional engineer ([[P. Eng.]]) in the field of ceramics and refractories, she lives and works in [[Canada]].
