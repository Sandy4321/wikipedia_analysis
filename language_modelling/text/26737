In [[mathematics]], the '''spherical coordinate system''' is a [[coordinate system]] for representing geometric figures in three dimensions using three coordinates: the radial distance of a point from a fixed origin, the [[zenith]] angle from the positive z-axis, and the [[azimuth]] angle from the positive x-axis.

==Notation==

Several different conventions exist for representing the three coordinates. In the United States, the components are typically notated as (''<U+03C1>'', ''<U+03C6>'', ''<U+03B8>'') for radial distance, zenith, and azimuth. Elsewhere, the notation for zenith and azimuth are reversed as (''<U+03C1>'', ''<U+03B8>'', ''<U+03C6>''). The former has the advantage of being most compatible with the notation for the two-dimensional [[polar coordinate system]] and the three-dimensional [[cylindrical coordinate system]], while the latter has broader acceptance geographically. Other notation uses ''r'' for radial distance.<ref>{{cite web

== Definition ==

The three coordinates (''<U+03C1>'', ''<U+03C6>'', ''<U+03B8>'') are defined as:
* ''<U+03C1>'' <U+2265> 0  is the distance from the origin to a given point ''P''.
* 0 <U+2264> ''<U+03C6>'' <U+2264> 180<U+00B0> is the angle between the positive z-axis and the line formed between the origin and ''P''.
* 0 <U+2264> ''<U+03B8>'' <U+2264> 360<U+00B0> is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line from the origin to the ''P'' projected onto the xy-plane.

''<U+03C6>'' is referred to as the zenith, colatitude or polar angle, while ''<U+03B8>'' is referred to as the azimuth.

''<U+03C6>'' and ''<U+03B8>'' lose significance when ''<U+03C1>'' = 0 and ''<U+03B8>'' loses significance when sin(''<U+03C6>'') = 0 (at ''<U+03C6>'' = 0 and ''<U+03C6>'' = 180<U+00B0>).

To plot a point from its spherical coordinates, go ''<U+03C1>'' units from the origin along the positive z-axis, rotate ''<U+03C6>'' about the y-axis in the direction of the positive x-axis and rotate ''<U+03B8>'' about the z-axis in the direction of the positive y-axis.

== Coordinate system conversions ==

As the spherical coordinate system is only one of many three-dimensional coordinate systems, there exist equations for converting coordinates between the spherical coordinate system and others.

===Cartesian coordinate system===
{{see|Cartesian coordinate system}}
The three spherical coordinates are obtained from [[Cartesian coordinates]] by:
:<math>{\rho}=\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}</math>
:<math>{\phi}=\arccos \left( {\frac{z}{{\sqrt {x^2 + y^2 + z^2 } }}} \right)</math>
:<math>{\theta}=\arctan \left( {\frac{y}{x}} \right)</math>

Conversely, Cartesian coordinates may be retrieved from spherical coordinates by:
:<math>{x}=\rho \, \sin\phi \, \cos\theta \quad </math>
:<math>{y}=\rho \, \sin\phi \, \sin\theta \quad </math>
:<math>{z}=\rho \, \cos\phi \quad </math>

===Geographic coordinate system===
{{see|Geographic coordinate system}}
The geographic coordinate system is an alternate version of the spherical coordinate system, used primarily in [[geography]] though also in mathematics and [[physics]] applications. In geography, ''<U+03C1>'' is usually dropped or replaced with a value representing elevation or altitude.

Latitude <math>{\delta}\,</math> is the complement of the zenith or colatitude, and can be converted by:
:<math>{\delta}=90^\circ - \phi</math>, or
:<math>{\phi}=90^\circ - \delta</math>,
though latitude is typically represented by <U+03C6> as well. This represents a zenith angle originating from the xy-plane with a domain -90<U+00B0> <U+2264> ''<U+03C6>'' <U+2264> 90<U+00B0>. The longitude is measured in degrees east or west from 0<U+00B0>, so its domain is -180<U+00B0> <U+2264> ''<U+03B8>'' <U+2264> 180<U+00B0>.

===Cylindrical coordinate system===
{{see|Cylindrical coordinate system}}
The cylindrical coordinate system is a three-dimensional extrusion of the [[polar coordinate system]], with an ''h'' coordinate to describe a point's height above or below the xy-plane. The full coordinate tuple is (''r'', ''<U+03B8>'', ''h'').

Spherical coordinates may be converted from cylindrical coordinates by:
:<math>{\rho}=\sqrt{r^2+h^2}</math>
:<math>{\theta}=\theta \quad</math>
:<math>{\phi}=\arctan\frac{r}{h}</math>

Cylindrical coordinates may be converted from spherical coordinates by:
:<math> r = \rho \sin \phi \,</math>
:<math> \theta  = \theta \,</math>
:<math> h  = \rho \cos \phi \,</math>

== Applications ==
The [[geographic coordinate system]] applies the two angles of the spherical coordinate system to express locations on Earth, calling them [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. Just as the two-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]] is useful on the plane, a two-dimensional spherical coordinate system is useful on the surface of a sphere. In this system, the sphere is taken as a unit sphere, so the radius is unity and can generally be ignored. This simplification can also be very useful when dealing with objects such as [[matrix rotation|rotational matrices]].

Spherical coordinates are useful in analyzing systems that are symmetrical about a point; a sphere that has the Cartesian equation ''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup> + ''z''<sup>2</sup> = ''c''<sup>2</sup> has the very simple equation ''<U+03C1>'' = ''c'' in spherical coordinates. An example is in solving a [[Multiple integral#Spherical coordinates|triple integral]] with a sphere as its domain.

The surface element is
:<math>\mathrm dS=\rho^2\sin\phi\,\mathrm d\phi\,\mathrm d\theta</math>

The volume element is
:<math>\mathrm dV=\rho^2\sin\phi\,\mathrm d\rho\,\mathrm d\phi\,\mathrm d\theta</math>

Spherical coordinates are the natural coordinates for describing and analyzing physical situations where there is spherical symmetry, such as the potential energy field surrounding a sphere (or point) with mass or charge.
Two important [[partial differential equations]], [[Laplace's equation]] and the [[Helmholtz equation]], allow a [[separation of variables]] in spherical coordinates. The angular portions of the solutions to such equations take the form of [[spherical harmonics]]. 

Another application is ergonomic design, where <math>{\rho}</math> is the arm length of a stationary person and the angles describe the direction of the arm as it reaches out.

The concept of spherical coordinates can be extended to higher dimensional spaces and are then referred to as [[hypersphere#Hyperspherical coordinates|hyperspherical coordinates]].
