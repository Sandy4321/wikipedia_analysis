[[Image:MatauriBay.png|right|thumb|300px|Panorama of Matauri Bay. The Cavalli Islands are further to the left.]]
Situated 30 km north of [[Kerikeri]], in [http://www.whangaroa.co.nz Whangaroa county], just north of the Bay of islands.'''Matauri Bay''' is one of the most beautiful places in [[New Zealand]], with over a kilometre of beautiful white sand and crystal clear water. It is particularly popular in the summer when thousands flock there to stay in the local camping ground which can be seen at the left hand end of the beach in the photo (right).

Matauri Bay has a very special place in the history of New Zealand, with some of the first [[Polynesia]]n navigators landing here, and also early contact with Europeans like the missionary [[Samuel Marsden]] in 1814.

Today Maturi Bay is popular with surfers, divers and fishers or for those wishing to get away from it all and have a family holiday. The water is very clear and the fishing can be very good.

==Rainbow Warrior==

The [[Rainbow Warrior (1978)|''Rainbow Warrior'']] was given a final resting place near Matauri Bay, at the [[Cavalli Islands]]. It has become a living reef, attracting marine life and recreational divers.

The idea was first proposed by the [[New Zealand Underwater Association]]. It seemed a fitting end for a ship that had spent its time protecting the marine environment.

It was towed north with a patched hull on [[2 December]] [[1987]]. Ten days later, a crowd of well-wishers looked on as it was given a traditional [[Maori]] burial. Now home to a complex ecosystem, the ''Rainbow Warrior'' has become a popular dive destination. The local Maori community maintains its guardianship and conservation. In a few short years, the ''Rainbow Warrior'' became an integral part of the environment it helped protect.

==Education==
[[Matauri Bay School]] is a contributing primary (years 1-6) school with a roll of 38.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tki.org.nz/e/schools/display_school_info.php?school_id=1044|title=Te Kete Ipurangi - Matauri Bay School|publisher=[[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)|Ministry of Education]]}}</ref> It opened in 1954.

[[Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Whangaroa]] is a full primary (years 1-8) school with a roll of 35.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tki.org.nz/e/schools/display_school_info.php?school_id=3106|title=Te Kete Ipurangi|publisher=[[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)|Ministry of Education]]}}</ref> It is a [[Kura Kaupapa M<U+0101>ori]] school which teaches fully in the [[M<U+0101>ori language]].

Both schools are coeducational and have a decile rating of 3.

A M<U+0101>ori school was established at Te Ngaere in 1876, but student numbers fluctuated as local people moved to seek an income on the gumfields. In 1890, attendance at the school ceased, and the building was dragged to the top of the hill by a bullock team to make it more accessible. Changing its name to Whakarara School, it remained open until Matauri Bay School replaced it.<ref>{{cite book|title=Whangaroa|last=Sale|first=E. V.|isbn=0-473-00387-2|year=1986|page=136}}</ref>
