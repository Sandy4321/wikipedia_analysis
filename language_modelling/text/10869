==Critical reception==
Chris Beaumont of [[Blogcritics]] recommended the DVD to consumers, giving it three and a half out of five stars. He noted that the audio quality was "pretty strong," and allows listeners to clearly hear every chord, note, and word that the band outputs, while the crowd noise proves that it is a live video, but is not so loud that it distracts viewers.<ref name="blog"/> Beamount also said that the video's quality "lacks a lot of the polish that more recent recordings have," but he later said that he would rather see it in low quality rather than high quality.<ref name="blog">Beaumont, Chris (2010-09-31).
