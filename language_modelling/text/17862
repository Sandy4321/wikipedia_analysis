'''Charles H. Getzein''' (sometimes spelled '''Getzien''') (February 14, 1864 <U+2013> June 19, 1932) was a [[starting pitcher]] in [[Major League Baseball]].  He played with four different [[National League]] teams from 1884 to 1891.  

Getzein was known by the nickname "Pretzels".  Sources conflict as to whether the nickname was derived from his German ethnicity or from the belief that he was able to throw a "double curve" following "the curves of a pretzel."<ref name=Theory/> During nine major league seasons, Getzein compiled a 145-139 record and a 3.46 [[earned run average]] (ERA).  He started 292 games and threw 277 [[complete game]]s, a total that ranks 58th among the all-time leaders in complete games.  Only three pitchers ([[Ed Morris (1880s pitcher)|Ed Morris]], [[Mark Baldwin (baseball)|Mark Baldwin]], and [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]]r [[Albert Spalding]]) threw more complete games in major league careers shorter than Getzein's nine-year career.

Getzein had his best seasons as a member of the [[Detroit Wolverines]], compiling records of 30-11 and 29-13 in 1886 and 1887.  In the [[1887 World Series]] (which Detroit won, 10 games to 5), Getzein pitched six [[complete game]]s and compiled a 4-2 record with a 2.48 ERA.  He also won 23 games for the [[Boston Beaneaters]] in 1890.

Sources are in conflict as to whether Getzein was born in Germany or [[Chicago]].<ref name=BR/><ref name=TSN>{{cite news|title=Sketch of the Men Who Now wear the Dauvray Medals|newspaper=The Sporting Life|date=1887|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingLife/1887/VOL_10_NO_04/SL1004003.pdf}}</ref>  He was known by the nickname "Pretzels" due to his German ethnicity.  He entered the majors in 1884 with the [[Detroit Wolverines]], playing there for five years before joining the [[Indianapolis Hoosiers (National League)|Indianapolis Hoosiers]] (1889), [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Beaneaters]] (1890<U+2013>1891), [[Cleveland Spiders]] (1891) and [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Browns]] (1892).<ref name=BR/>

Getzein's record for complete games is based in part on the customs of the 1880s.  In 1915, ''Baseball Magazine'' reported that managers were not allowed to freely pull the starting pitcher from a game in the bygone era.  It cited a incident involving Getzein to illustrate the old practice:<blockquote>"The Nationals got onto Getzein in the fourth inning and batted him all over the field. In the fifth inning they kept up the slugging until Getzein said he was ill, and Manager Hanlon wanted the Nationals to allow Getzein to retire, claiming that he was too sick to play. Baker, captaining the home club, said he would call a doctor and have him examine Getzein, and if the latter was really sick he would probably allow the change to be made. Dr. Bond, who happened to be present, was called on, and he examined the pitcher, while the crowd guyed Getzein terribly. The doctor announced that he did not consider Getzein sick, only discouraged at the pounding he had received, and that he would be able to finish the game."<ref>{{cite news|title=Baseball Customs Past and Present|publisher=Baseball Magazine|date=October 1915|author=William A.

===Early years===
Getzein began playing baseball as a boy in Chicago.<ref name=TSN/>  He played as an amateur in the Chicago City League.<ref name=DD/>  In 1882, he signed with the [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], team in the [[Northwestern League]].<ref name=DD>{{cite news|title=Death's Doing: Edward Gastfield, Once a Well-Known Catcher, Joins the Great Silent Majority|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=December 16, 1899|page=3|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingLife/1899/VOL_34_NO_13/SL3413003.pdf}}</ref><ref name=TSN/>  According to an account published in ''The Sporting News'', he "pitched his puzzling twisters and curves in the Northwestern League while that organization was in existence."<ref name=TSN/>

In 1883, he compiled a record of 14-12 for Grand Rapids.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charlie Getzien Biographical Information - BR Bullpen|publisher=USA Today Sports Reference Digital Properties|work=baseball-reference.com|accessdate=February 28, 2013|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Pretzels_Getzien}}</ref>  In April 1883, Getzein pitched against the [[Detroit Wolverines]].

In 1884, Getzein threw 30 complete games and 11 shutouts for Grand Rapids, compiling a 27-4 record and a 0.53 [[earned run average]] (ERA).<ref>{{cite web|title=1884 Grand Rapids|publisher=USA Today Sports Reference Digital Properties|work=baseball-reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=a61bdbdc|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref>  

On August 9, 1884, the Grand Rapids team was dropped from the Northwestern League and disbanded.  [[Jack Chapman]], manager of the [[Detroit Wolverines]], seized the opportunity to sign five former Grand Rapids players, including "what is known as the 'G' battery -- Getzein and Gastfield."<ref name=DFP/>  The ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' reported that Getzein "has been a formidable man to face in the Northwestern League, in one instance striking out sixteen batters."<ref name=DFP>{{cite news|title=Sporting Matters: Chapman Engages Five Players of the Disbanded Grand Rapids Team|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=August 12, 1884|page=8|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1875327392.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Aug+12%2C+1884&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=8&desc=SPORTING+MATTERS.}}</ref>

Getzein made his major league debut at Detroit's [[Recreation Park]] on August 13, 1884.  Getzien faced Cleveland and did not allow an earned run.  The ''Detroit Free Press'' took note of Getzein's performance:<blockquote>"Getzien caused the Cleveland batters to pound the air thirty-seven times, and eleven more strikes were called.  It is a great record, and one that is seldom equaled.  He had great speed at the outset, and struck out six of the first eight men who came to the bat.  He could not maintain the pace, however, and was not so effective in the latter portion of the game, but was sufficiently so to prevent any one from earning a run."<ref name=Debut>{{cite news|title=Sporting Matters: Detroit's Weak Batting Team Shut out by the Cleveland Team|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=August 14, 1884|page=3|url=}}</ref></blockquote>

Despite Getzein's pitching performance, Detroit lost the game by a 1-0 score as Cleveland scored an unearned run.<ref name=Debut/>  Getzein went on to start (and complete) 17 games for the Wolverines during the remaining two months of the 1883 season.  He posted a 5-12 record for a Detroit team that finished in last place in the [[National League]] with a 28-84 record, 56 games out of contention.<ref>{{cite web|title=1884 Detroit Wolverines|publisher=USA Today Sports Reference Digital Properties|work=baseball-reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/DTN/1884.shtml|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref>  Getzein provided one of the few highlights for the [[1884 Detroit Wolverines season|1884 Wolverines]], pitching a six-inning [[no-hitter]] against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] on October 1, 1884.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1884 |title=Charlton's Baseball Chronology - 1884|publisher=BaseballLibrary.com|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}("October 1 Charlie Getzein (Detroit NL) hurls a 6-inning no-hitter against Philadelphia<U+201A> winning<U+201A> 1-0.")

It should contain further fact that of eighteen men at bat he struck out ten, and of the other eight but one hit the ball beyond the diamond - Purcell, in the first inning, a fly to Weidman.  Of the other seven, only three hit to the diamond, or a total of four balls struck inside the foul lines.  Of the eighteen, [Detroit catcher] Gastfield put out eleven and threw out three others, Bennett, Scott and Weidman each had a fly, and Jones threw one out at first."<ref>{{cite news|title=Sporting Matters: Getzien and Gastfield, With a Little Aid, Play a Wonderful Game; Not a Philadelphian Batting for even the Semblance of a Base|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=October 2, 1884|page=7|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1875427252.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Oct+2%2C+1884&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=7&desc=SPORTING+MATTERS.}}</ref></blockquote>

Getzein finished the 1884 season with a 1.95 [[earned run average]], third best in the National League behind [[Old Hoss Radbourn]] (1.38) and [[Charlie Sweeney]] (1.95), both of whom played for the league champion [[Providence Grays]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1884-pitching-leaders.shtml|title=1884 National League Pitching Leaders|publisher=USA Today Sports Reference Digital Properties|work=baseball-reference.com|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref>

Over the course of the full 1884 season, pitching for both Grand Rapids and Detroit, Getzein started and completed 47 games and pitched 423-1/3 innings.<ref name=BR/>

During his career, Getzein's drew acclaim for his curve ball.  The pitch was sometimes referred to as the "pretzel curve."<ref name=TSN/><ref>{{cite news|title=Notes and Comments|newspaper=The Sporting Life|date=July 21, 1886|page=3|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingLife/1886/VOL_07_NO_15/SL0715003.pdf}}("Getzein's 'pretzel curves' are again effective, now that he is through with the Chicagos for a while.")</ref>  ''[[The Sporting Life]]'' described Getzein's unusual delivery as follows: "In delivering his 'pretzels' 'Getz' faces third base with one foot in either corner of the lower end of the box.  Bending the left knee slightly, he draws his right arm well back.  Then, straightening up quickly, he slides the left foot forward with a characteristic little skip, and, bringing his arm around with a swift overhand swing, drives the ball in at a lively pace."<ref name=TSN/>

After a Getzein victory over the Kansas City Cowboys in 1886, the ''Detroit Free Press'' wrote: "The Pretzel is all right.  He went into the box to-day and pitched one of his finest, his curves circling around in the form of the delicious pastry from which Getz takes his sobriquet."<ref>{{cite news|title=Getzien Goes In: Our Sturdy German Twirler Does Good Work at Kansas City; The Cowboys Unable to Size Up His Drops and Curves|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=September 15, 1886|page=8|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1741140532.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Sep+15%2C+1886&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=8&desc=GETZIEN+GOES+IN.}}</ref>  However, the editor of the Grand Rapids ''World'' opined that Getzein's "curved ball" was a fiction.  He wrote:<blockquote>"The baseball enthusiasts claim for Getzein that he is able to so pitch a ball that it will describe the arc of a circle on a horizontal plane before reaching the catcher, and that therein lies the secret of his marvelous pitching . . .  Scientifically, this theory is utterly absurd. The forces that act upon a ball pitched by Getzein are not different from those which operate upon a projectile thrown from any other source, and the results must be the same, and governed by the same laws. The curves are in the imagination of Getzein's admirers. When the ball leaves his hand it is beyond his control, and it moves forward from the impulse last given it as it leaves his hand. It is then controlled by the force of propulsion, the resistance of the atmosphere, and gravitation. . . . Getzein's antic and deceptive motions may deceive the batter, so that he is unable to discover the exact course of the ball in time to strike it, but he cannot throw a ball so as to make a curve on the horizontal plane."<ref name=SA/></blockquote>
The ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine responded in July 1886 by publishing an article written by [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]] (accompanied by several diagrams, two of which are reproduced above) explaining the physics behind the curve ball pitch.<ref name=SA>{{cite news|author=Henry Chadwick|publisher=Scientific American|title=The Art of Pitching in Baseball|date=July 31, 1886|pages=71-72|url=http://www.thediamondangle.com/archive/july03/pageone.jpg}}</ref>

In 1891, [[O. P. Caylor]] in ''[[Outing (magazine)|Outing]]'' magazine examined "The Theory and Introduction of Curve Pitching" and noted that many "ignorant ball players" had believed that Getzein was capable of throwing a "double curve."<ref name=Theory>{{cite news|title=The Theory and Introduction of Curve Pitching|author=[[O.

===1885 season===
Getzein compiled a 12-25 record in 1885 and saw his earned run average jump to 3.03.<ref name=BR/>  His record in 1885 was again impacted by playing with an uncompetitive team.  The [[1885 Detroit Wolverines season|1885 Wolverines]] finished the season in sixth place with a 41-67 record.<ref>{{cite web|title=1885 Detroit Wolverines|publisher=USA Today Sports Reference Digital Properties|work=baseball-reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/DTN/1885.shtml|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref>

===1886 season===
In 1886, Getzein and the Wolverines saw their fortunes rise as the Wolverines assembled one of the best hitting teams in National League history featuring, among others, [[Dan Brouthers]], [[Sam Thompson]], [[Hardy Richardson]], and [[Jack Rowe]].  Despite having a 3.03 earned run average (precisely the same as his 1885 performance), Getzein won a career-high 30 victories against 11 losses.<ref name=BR/>  Getzein was not the Wolverines' leading pitcher in 1886, as teammate [[Lady Baldwin]] led the National League with 42 wins.  The [[1886 Detroit Wolverines season|1886 Wolverines]] finished in second place, 2<U+00BD> games behind the [[1886 Chicago White Stockings season|Chicago White Stockings]], with a 87-36 record and a .707 winning percentage.<ref>{{cite web|title=1886 Detroit Wolverines|publisher=USA Today Sports Reference Digital Properties|work=baseball-reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/DTN/1886.shtml|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref> 

===1887 season===
In 1887, Getzein was the leading pitcher on a [[1887 Detroit Wolverines season|Detroit Wolverines]] team that won the National League pennant and then defeated the St. Louis Browns in the [[1887 World Series]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1887 Detroit Wolverines|publisher=USA Today Sports Reference Digital Properties|work=baseball-reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/DTN/1887.shtml|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref>  Getzein compiled a 29-13 record and a 3.73 ERA, leading the league in [[winning percentage]] (.690) but also in home runs allowed (24).<ref name=BR/>  In September 1887, a group of influential fans in Detroit contributed money to purchase "an elegant two hundred dollar gold watch and chain" for Getzein to express their admiration for Getzein's "magnificent work for the club."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Getzein in Luck: Detroit to Reward Him for His Faithful Work|newspaper=The Sporting Life|date=September 7, 1887|page=1|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingLife/1887/VOL_09_NO_22/SL0922001.pdf}}</ref> 

In the 1887 World Series (which Detroit won, 10 games to 5), Getzein pitched six [[complete game]]s and compiled a 4-2 record with a 2.48 ERA.<ref name=BR/>  On October 17, 1887, Getzien pitched a no-hitter through the first eight innings in Game 10 of the World Series played before 10,000 spectators at the [[Polo Grounds]] in New York.  The ''Detroit Free Press'' wrote: "Getzien made a remarkable showing.  Up to and including the eighth inning only twenty-seven men went to the bat and not a clean hit had been scored.  Not till the ninth did the world beaters succeed in getting a hit, and then they failed to score the much desired run."<ref>{{cite news|title=The Browns Whitewashed: Getzien Holds the World Beaters Down to Three Actual Hits|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=October 17, 1887|page=5|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1725321302.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Oct+17%2C+1887&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=5&desc=THE+BROWNS+WHITE+WASHED.}}</ref>

He started 46 games and completed 45 of them with 404 innings pitched.<ref name=BR/> However, Getzein lost his role at the team's leading pitcher, as [[Pete Conway]] compiled a 30-14 record and a 2.25 ERA for the [[1888 Detroit Wolverines season|1888 Wolverines]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1888 Detroit Wolverines|publisher=USA Today Sports Reference Digital Properties|work=baseball-reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/DTN/1888.shtml|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref>  After Getzein gave up 10 runs in an August 1888 game against Washington, the ''Detroit Free Press'' dubbed him the "Pulverized Pretzel."<ref name=PP/>  The newspaper reported: "The Detroits were defeated again to-day ... simply because Getzein could not keep the ball away from the Senatorial bat.

After a game in which Getzein gave up 21 hits against Boston, ''The Sporting Life'' reported on speculation that Getzein may have intentionally thrown the game: <blockquote>"The Getzein episode makes Detroiters weary.  The Bostons have no license to make 21 hits off the Pretzel when he pitches his game.  Either he was not in condition to pitch or he didn't try to. . . . If the latter, and he repeated his performance against the Kansas Citys a few years ago, when he deliberately tossed the balls to the plate and permitted the Cowboys to make 13 runs in one inning, why no one here would mourn much if he was fined to the limit.  What the merits of his quarrel with Watkins are of course are not known here.  But Getzein is inclined to be very free with his tongue.  Considering his fine treatment here it is time for him to get over his childish humors and do the best he knows how whenever called on."<ref>{{cite news|title=Detroit Speculations|newspaper=The Sporting Life|date=June 20, 1888|page=1|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingLife/1888/VOL_11_NO_11/SL1111001.pdf}}</ref></blockquote>

''The Sporting Life'' reported: "The signing of Getzein by the Boston League Club re-unites the famous 'Pretzel Battery,' Getzein and Ganzel, of the Detroit ex-champions."<ref>{{cite news|title=Notes and Gossip|newspaper=The Sporting Life|page=3|date=April 5, 1890|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingLife/1890/VOL_15_NO_01/SL1501003.pdf}}</ref>

Getzein began the 1891 season with Boston, but he was released by the team on July 16, 1891, after compiling a 4-5 record in nine starts.

He concluded his major league career appearing in 13 games for the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Browns]] in 1892.<ref name=BR/>

In 1894, Getzein was reported to be playing [[first base]] for a Chicago City League team.<ref>{{cite news|title=Editorial Views, News, Comment|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=May 19, 1894|page=3|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingLife/1894/VOL_23_NO_08/SL2308003.pdf}}</ref>
