'''Leverett George DeVeber''' (sometimes spelled '''De Veber'''<ref name="Benidickson 178">Benidickson 178</ref><ref>Jamieson 396</ref>) (February 10, 1849 &ndash; July 9, 1925) was a Canadian politician who served as Member of the Legislative Assemblies of [[Alberta]] and the [[Northwest Territories]], minister in the government of Alberta, and member of the [[Senate of Canada]].  Born in [[New Brunswick]] and trained as a physician, he joined the [[North-West Mounted Police]] and came west, eventually settling in [[Lethbridge]] after leaving the police force.  He represented Lethbridge in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories]] from 1898 until 1905, when Lethbridge became part of the new province of Alberta.  He was appointed [[Minister without Portfolio]] in Alberta's first government, but resigned four months later to accept an appointment to the Senate, where he remained until his death.

==Early life==

DeVeber was born February 10, 1849, in [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], [[New Brunswick]].  His great grandfather, Gabriel DeVeber, had been a British army officer who was rewarded for his service in the [[American Revolution]] with land in New Brunswick, where his descendants had lived since.<ref>Blue 267</ref>  Leverett George DeVeber was educated in Saint John and [[Kingston, New Brunswick|Kingston]] before attending [[University of King's College|King's College]] in [[Windsor, Nova Scotia|Windsor]], [[Nova Scotia]].<ref name="Blue 268">Blue 268</ref>  He was a prominent [[rowing|rower]] in New Brunswick, and also played [[cricket (sport)|cricket]] and [[baseball]] and took part in [[shooting]], [[hunting]], and [[fishing]] events.<ref>Blue 269</ref>

He studied for a year at [[Harvard College]] and then completed his medical studies at [[St. Bartholomew's Hospital]] in [[London]], from which he graduated in 1870.  He then studied at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] for a year.  He practiced medicine in Saint John for six years,<ref name="Blue 268"/> before coming west to join the [[North-West Mounted Police]] as a surgeon in 1882.  Over the next three years he was stationed at [[Fort Walsh]], [[Calgary]], [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Fort MacLeod]]; it was to this last town that he left the NWMP to set up a civilian practice in 1885.<ref>Jamieson 396<U+2013>397</ref>

In 1887 DeVeber married Rachael Ann Ryan, who was born in [[Melbourne]] where her father was posted with the British Army.  The pair would have two children: Marion Frances DeVeber, who married shipbuilder Francis Dunn and moved to England, and Leverett Sandys DeVeber, who worked in [[Toronto]] for the [[Bank of Montreal]].<ref name="Blue 268"/>

DeVeber moved to [[Lethbridge, Alberta|Lethbridge]] in 1890,<ref name="Blue 268"/> and became its [[Medical Officer of Health]] in 1893,<ref>Jamieson 397</ref> in which capacity he continued until at least 1924.<ref name="Blue 268"/>  In Lethbridge he was involved in music: he took charge of his church's choir in 1891, and the same year sang at a local concert after the intended headliner, [[Nora Clench]], failed to show up.<ref>Obee 13, 28</ref>  He was also active with the [[Episcopalian]] church and the [[Fraternal Forestry|Canadian Order of Foresters]].<ref name="Blue 268"/>

==Political career==
===Territorial and provincial service===
DeVeber was acclaimed to the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories]] in the [[Northwest Territories general election, 1898|1898 election]], and re-elected in the [[Northwest Territories general election, 1902|1902 election]].<ref name="Blue 268"/><ref name="NWT results"/>  Though he was a [[Northwest Territories Liberal Party|Liberal]],<ref name="Blue 268"/> he wholeheartedly supported the efforts of [[Premier of the Northwest Territories|Premier]] [[Frederick W. A. G. Haultain]] to conduct territory politics along non-partisan lines.  As the federal government prepared to create two new provinces, [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]], out of the Northwest Territoes, DeVeber joined with Haultain in advocating the continuation of this non-partisan approach into the governments of the new provinces.<ref name="Thomas 22">Thomas 22</ref>  This position put him at odds with the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] federal government, led by [[Wilfrid Laurier]], who wanted the new provinces' governments to be Liberal.  A Liberal, [[George Bulyea]], was therefore appointed [[Lieutenant Governor of Alberta]],  and it was understood that he would appoint a Liberal as the province's first Premier.<ref>Thomas 17<U+2013>18</ref>

After Alberta's two most prominent Liberals, [[Peter Talbot (politician)|Peter Talbot]] and [[Frank Oliver (politician)|Frank Oliver]], made it clear that they were not interested, DeVeber considered himself as possible candidate.<ref name="Thomas 22"/>  Less than two months before Alberta's formal creation, he wrote to his colleague in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories]], [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]], that the possibilities "practically came to you and I, both of us weak enough God knows but we have the sense to see it."<ref name="Thomas 18">Thomas 18</ref>  DeVeber's belief that he may be appointed Premier does not appear to have been well-founded: his opposition to the introduction of party lines earned him the enmity of some Liberals, not least because it aligned him with Haultain, a [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]].  In the estimation of historian L. G. Thomas, DeVeber's fellow Liberals "were not inclined to take him too seriously" as a potential premier.<ref name="Thomas 18"/>

Once it became clear that he was not to become premier, DeVeber turned his ambitions towards the [[Canadian Senate]].  Though he had little interest in sustained involvement with the government of Alberta, he accepted Rutherford's (for Rutherford had been named premier) invitation to serve in his first cabinet as [[Minister without Portfolio]].  He made clear that he viewed the appointment as an interim one, to give Rutherford time to evaluate the many novice politicians entering the new province's legislature and, in DeVeber's words, "ascertain who of the new blood will rise to the surface".<ref name="Thomas 22"/>  In keeping with the expectations of a government minister in the [[Westminster system]], DeVeber ran in the [[Alberta general election, 1905|1905 provincial election]], defeating [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] [[William Carlos Ives]] by a comfortable margin in the [[Lethbridge (provincial electoral district)|Lethbridge]] electoral district.<ref name="1905 results"/>

===Senator===
DeVeber did not serve long either as minister of [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]]: having received word that he was to be appointed to the Senate, he resigned from cabinet on March 1, 1906<U+2014>exactly four months after his appointment<U+2014>and from the legislature March 7.  He formally began his term as Senator the next day.<ref name="parlinfo">{{cite web |url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=5ce26910-e4c6-4b83-a68d-47ededa3da1a&Language=E&Section=ALL |title=Parliamentarian file<U+2014>DeVeber, The Hon. Leverett George |accessdate=2010-3-30}}</ref>

While in the Senate, DeVeber chaired the Standing Committee on Public Health and Inspection of Foods.  One issue examined by this committee was [[water pollution]]: beginning in March 1909 and for nearly a year afterwards, it studied the question in view of the increasing mortality from [[typhoid fever]], and concluded, in the words of the [[University of Michigan]]'s Jennifer Read, "that the country required some form of legislation to manage the problem.  However, it was at a loss about the form it should take and from what body it should emanate."<ref name="Read 111">Read 111</ref>  As chair of the committee, DeVeber attended an October 1910 federal-provincial in [[Ottawa]] called to attempt to coordinate all Canadian jurisdictions' responses to water pollution.<ref name="Read 111"/>  Besides recommending that provincial governments use their constitutional authority over health and municipal government to prevent undue water pollution from municipal sewage systems, it advised the federal government to use its authority over navigable waterways to prohibit the dumping of most waste into them; DeVeber supplied a draft bill for Parliament's consideration.<ref>Read 112</ref>

At the same time, DeVeber's colleague [[Napol<U+00E9>on Belcourt]] was championing a similar measure in the Senate (as an Ottawa resident, Belcourt was disturbed by the effect on the city's water supply by the dumping of waste upstream, in [[Aylmer, Quebec|Aylmer]], [[Quebec]]),<ref name="Read 111"/> and while doing so he quoted extensively from the report of DeVeber's committee.  When Belcourt's bill came up for debate, DeVeber scolded him on the floor of the Senate for misrepresenting the committee's report as being much more supportive of the bill than it actually was; in the estimation of [[University of Ottawa]] law professor Jamie Benidickson, DeVeber's comments assured the bill's defeat.<ref name="Benidickson 178"/>

DeVeber remained a Senator until his death in 1925.<ref name="parlinfo"/>  Alberta's [[Mount DeVeber]], located in [[Willmore Wilderness Park]], is named in his honour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deveber.org/meet-us |title=Meet us |publisher=The deVeber Institute for Bioethics and Social Research |accessdate=2010-3-30}}</ref>
