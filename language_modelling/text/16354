'''''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>''''' was a [[pre-dreadnought]] [[battleship]] of the [[Libert<U+00E9> class battleship|''Libert<U+00E9>'' class]] built by the [[French Navy]]. She had three [[sister ship]]s: [[French battleship Libert<U+00E9>|''Libert<U+00E9>'']], [[French battleship Justice|''Justice'']], and [[French battleship D<U+00E9>mocratie|''D<U+00E9>mocratie'']]. ''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>'' was laid down in April 1903, launched in May 1907, and completed in June 1908, over a year after the revolutionary British battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} made ships like ''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>'' obsolete. She was armed with a main battery of four {{convert|305|mm|abbr=on}} guns, compared to the ten guns of the same caliber mounted on ''Dreadnought''.

''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>'' took the French President on a goodwill trip to Russia in 1908 and visited America in September 1909. In September 1911, she was damaged by the explosion that destroyed her sister ''Libert<U+00E9>'' in [[Toulon]]. At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, she covered troop convoys from North Africa to France along with the rest of the French Mediterranean Fleet. She spent the rest of the war based at [[Corfu]] and later [[Mudros]], without seeing any action at either location. After the end of the war, she was stricken from the [[naval register]] and broken up for scrap in 1922.

''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>'' was laid down at the ''[[Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde]]'' shipyard in [[Bordeaux]] in April 1903, launched on 28 May 1907, and completed in June 1908,<ref name=G297>Gardiner, p. 297</ref> over a year after the radically innovative British battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, which rendered the [[pre-dreadnought]]s like ''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>'' outdated before they were completed.<ref>Gardiner & Gray, p. 21</ref> The ship was {{convert|133.81|m|sp=us|ftin}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|24.26|m|abbr=on|ftin}} and a full-load [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|8.41|m|abbr=on|ftin}}. She displaced up to {{convert|14489|MT|sp=us}} at full load. The ship had a crew of between 739 and 769 officers and enlisted men. ''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>'' was powered by three vertical [[triple expansion engine]]s with twenty-two [[Belleville boiler]]s. They were rated at {{convert|18500|ihp|lk=in}} and provided a top speed of {{convert|19|kn|lk=in}}. Coal storage amounted to {{convert|1800|MT|abbr=on}}.<ref name=G297/>

''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>''{{'}}s main battery consisted of four [[Canon de 305 mm Mod<U+00E8>le 1893/96 gun]]s mounted in two twin [[gun turret]]s, one forward and one aft. The secondary battery consisted of ten [[Canon de 194 mm Mod<U+00E8>le 1902]] guns; six were mounted in single turrets, and four in [[casemate]]s in the hull. She also carried thirteen 9-pounder guns and ten 3-pounders. Additionally, the ship was armed with two {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s submerged in the hull. The ship's [[belt armor|main belt]] was {{convert|280|mm|abbr=on|1}} thick and the main battery was protected by up to {{convert|350|mm|abbr=on|1}} of armor. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|305|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides.<ref name=G297/>

== Service history ==
''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>''{{'}}s first major assignment assignment was received in late July 1908, a month after she joined the French fleet. She carried the [[President of France]] [[Armand Falli<U+00E8>res]] to [[Reval]], Russia, arriving on 27 July. There, Falli<U+00E8>res visited with the Russian Tsar, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], who inspected ''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>''.<ref>''The Standard'', p. 1</ref> She joined [[French battleship Libert<U+00E9>|''Libert<U+00E9>'']] and [[French battleship Justice|''Justice'']] for a visit to the United States for the [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]] in September 1909. The three ships, representing France during the celebrations and commanded by Admiral Jules le Pord, were the first foreign ships to arrive.<ref>Levine & Panetta, p. 51</ref> The ships departed from [[Brest, France|Brest]] and reached New York seven days later, having run at an average of {{convert|16|kn}}; the performance of the ships' propulsion systems was regarded as satisfactory by contemporary naval experts, including the [[United States Naval Institute]].<ref>Alger, p. 1415</ref> In early 1911, the French Navy conducted experiments with [[wireless telegraphy]], and used ''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>'' and ''Justice'' for the tests. The wireless transmitters could pick up messages as far as {{convert|72|mi}} away.<ref>Alger, p. 283</ref> On 25 September 1911, ''Libert<U+00E9>'' was destroyed by an accidental explosion in [[Toulon]], the result of the spontaneous combustion of [[nitrocellulose]] gel in her ammunition magazines.<ref name=G297/> Debris hurled by the explosion damaged several nearby battleships, including ''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>''.<ref>Windsor, p. 653</ref>

At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, ''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>'' was assigned to the 1st Division of the 2nd Squadron in the [[Mediterranean]], along with [[French battleship R<U+00E9>publique|''R<U+00E9>publique'']] and [[French battleship Patrie|''Patrie'']].<ref>Guernsey, p. 179</ref> The French fleet was initially used to cover the movement of French troops<U+2014>the [[19th Army Corps (France)|XIX Corps]]<U+2014>from Algeria to metropolitan France. As a result, the fleet was far out of position to catch the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}}, which, contrary to French expectations, steamed to [[Constantinople]] rather than attempt to interfere with the troop transports.<ref>Halpern (1995), pp. 55<U+2013>56</ref> For the majority of the war, the French used their main fleet to keep the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austro-Hungarian fleet]] bottled up in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. In 1914 she participated in the [[Battle of Antivari]], where the [[line of battle|battle line]] caught the Austro-Hungarian cruiser {{SMS|Zenta}} by surprise and sank her. The French battleships then bombarded Austrian fortifications at [[Kotor|Cattaro]] in an attempt to draw out the Austro-Hungarian fleet, which refused to take the bait.<ref>Halpern (2004), p. 4</ref>

The French operations in the area were hampered by a lack of a suitable base close to the mouth of the Adriatic; the British had given the French free access to [[Malta]], but it was hundreds of miles away. The Austrians also possessed several [[submarine]]s, [[SM U-12 (Austria-Hungary)|one of which]] torpedoed the [[dreadnought]] [[French battleship Jean Bart (1911)|''Jean Bart'']] in December 1914. The threat from underwater weapons greatly limited French naval activities in the Adriatic.<ref>Halpern (2004), pp. 3<U+2013>4</ref> As the war progressed, the French eventually settled on [[Corfu]] as their primary naval base in the area.<ref>Halpern (2004), p. 16</ref> Later in the war, ''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>'' was sent to [[Mudros]] along with her sister ships.<ref>Preston, p. 29</ref> After the end of the war, ''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>'' was stricken from the [[naval register]] in 1922 and subsequently broken up for scrap.<ref name=G297/>
