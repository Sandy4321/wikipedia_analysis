'''''Iron Flag''''' is the fourth studio album by American [[East Coast hip hop]] collective [[Wu-Tang Clan]], released on December 18, 2001 on [[Loud Records]]. It was certified gold in sales by the [[RIAA]]. ''Iron Flag'' served as the group's second lowest-selling album (687,000 copies), as their record label, Loud, was on the verge of shutting down at the time. The album debuted at No. 32 on the [[Billboard 200]] with 153,000 copies sold in its first week of release.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Overview==
A gap of four years separated both the [[Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)|first]] and [[Wu-Tang Forever|second]] albums, and the second and third albums, with those gaps being filled by a myriad of solo projects. It was consequently surprising to many when the Clan reformed for a new LP only a year after their well-received 2000 album ''[[The W]]'', with only [[RZA]]'s ''[[Digital Bullet]]'' and [[Ghostface Killah]]'s ''[[Bulletproof Wallets]]'' released in between.  The album's promotion was also quite low-key, particularly in comparison to the fanfare, hype and expensive [[music videos|videos]] that had preceded the release of the group's two previous albums. Unusual for hip hop albums of the time, ''Iron Flag'' only consists of twelve tracks (which contain thirteen songs plus a short introduction) with no interludes or skits between songs. This is similar to ''The W'', which only consisted of thirteen tracks (though unlike ''Iron Flag'' it did feature interludes and skits).

===Album cover===
The album cover is inspired by the [[Iwo Jima]] [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima|flag-raising photo from 1945]], one of the most famous photos of all time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Absences==
[[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]'s contributions to the Wu-Tang's group albums continued to decrease with each successive album: after being one of the main stars of ''Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers'', he was by far the least prolific Clan member on the group's follow-up album ''Wu-Tang Forever''. He then made only one appearance on ''The W'' (on the song "Conditioner") due to being engulfed in legal troubles; legal troubles which in the year separating ''The W'' and ''Iron Flag'' had only gotten worse. Consequently, ODB does not appear on ''Iron Flag'' at all, making ''The W'' the final Wu-Tang album to feature him. He does, however, appear on ''[[8 Diagrams]]'' posthumously.

Another absentee is [[Cappadonna]]: after being merely a very close affiliate of the group on ''Wu-Tang Forever'', he appeared to have become absorbed into the group itself as a full member on ''The W'' (tracks with his contributions no longer being marked as "featuring Cappadonna"). In the year following the release of ''The W'' Cappadonna had become dissatisfied with being in the group (RZA has said he felt unhappy that people outside of the group did not respect him as much as the original nine members) and had also been in dispute with the group over the revelation that his manager Michael Caruso was a police informant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5922868/wutang_clan_fires_manager_after_village_voice_expose|title=Wu-Tang Clan Fires Manager After Village Voice Expose|author=Jennifer Vineyard|work=Rolling Stone|date=2000-05-26|accessdate=2012-06-22|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070314221533/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5922868/wutang_clan_fires_manager_after_village_voice_expose|archivedate=2007-03-14|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Whatever the case, he does not appear on the album. Although, it should be noted that he appears on the original cover of the album but was air brushed out. The original cover appears on the back of the "Wu-Tang Manual" by RZA. This suggests that he might have been removed from the album in post production.

==Revisiting old sounds==
Rather than stick to one unified sound for most of the album's tracks, as with previous Clan albums, much of ''Iron Flag'' returns to many different individual sounds and styles that the Wu-Tang had visited over the years:
*"Chrome Wheels" uses the [[synthesizer]]-heavy "digital orchestra" sound of RZA's ''[[Bobby Digital In Stereo]]'' (RZA also raps in the song as his Bobby Digital persona, and Bobby Digital is name checked in the [[bridge (music)|bridge]] (sung by Madame D). "Dashing (Reasons)" also uses the Bobby Digital sound, with the Digital trademarks of the off-kilter keyboard riff, a high-pitched [[portamento]] sine wave [[synthesizer]], and prominent synthesized [[hi-hat]]s.
*"Radioactive (Four Assassins)" is firmly in the gritty, foreboding style of the Wu-Tang's debut album ''Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)'': it has a recurring dialogue sample from a [[martial arts]] movie, short and indistinct one-[[note]] [[Sampling (music)|samples]] buried in the mix, a quickly looping ascending [[bassline]], and hard, pounding drums. The beat also incorporates the sound of [[shuriken]] throwing blades, which are "launched" with a single B note, before the sound effect [[Panning (audio)|pans]] from right to left then back again before dissipating. The repeated horn blare at the start of every bar is also reminiscent of [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], particularly "Night of the Living Baseheads."
*"Iron Flag" has all the hallmarks of the ''Wu-Tang Forever'' sound: string samples coupled with subtle keyboards and a sped-up vocal sample (a technique which was pioneered by the RZA on ''Wu-Tang Forever'' but which by the time of Iron Flag's release had been widely imitated by many, most notably [[Just Blaze]] and [[Kanye West]]).
*"Uzi (Pinky Ring)" recalls ''The W'''s murky [[blaxploitation]]-influenced atmosphere with its dramatic horn riffs and gritty drums. "Soul Power (Black Jungle)" is also reminiscent, albeit to a lesser extent, of ''The W''.

==Wu-Elements contributions==
Many of the remaining tracks sound little like much the Clan had done before, and little like each other.{{Says who|date=March 2011}} This may be a result of the collaborators involved: all of the above tracks are produced by the RZA, whereas of the remaining six, only two are RZA produced. Two are produced by in-house [[Wu-Elements]] producers [[True Master]] and [[Mathematics (producer)|Mathematics]]:

*True Master's "Y'all Been Warned" is a simple one-[[bar (music)|bar]] composition with a funky guitar riff over a steady rhythm and a deeply buried piano sample. The advance copy of ''Iron Flag'' featured a slightly different version of this song which featured a synthesizer line over the top of the guitar riff. It is not known why this was changed for the final release.
*Mathematics' "Rules" features a pattern of one bar repeated three times then a one-bar turnaround. The repeated bar features four samples layered in a vaguely call-and-response structure: an initial horn sample is answered by a [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]] grunt, which is answered by a two-chord piano sample, which is answered by another James Brown grunt. The horn sample is highest in the mix and effectively "leads" the other samples. The turnaround bar has two descending [[chord (music)|chords]] with a high-pitched picked guitar [[riff]], bringing the four-bar pattern to the start once again. With its intro of scratched samples of various Wu-Tang lyrics, this track can be viewed as reminiscent of hip-hop producer DJ Premier's distinctive style.

Though these two producers are known for their distinctly traditional Wu-Tang sound, these two beats do not particularly resemble much of the Clan's previous output, at least not as a group. If anything, they resemble some of the sharp 1970s [[soul music|soul]]-influenced funk tracks from the Wu-Tang's 1999-2000 solo albums ([[U-God]]'s "Dat Gangsta" and "Soul Dazzle" from ''[[Golden Arms Redemption]]'', [[Inspectah Deck]]'s "Word on the Street" and "Movers and Shakers" from ''[[Uncontrolled Substance]]'').

==Outside collaborators==
There had been some discontent among fans and critics when ''The W'' included non-Wu Tang affiliated hip hop crossover superstars [[Busta Rhymes]] and [[Snoop Dogg]]. Nevertheless, ''Iron Flag'' also makes use of non-Wu artists well known in their own right: [[Flavor Flav]] of Public Enemy provides the chorus for "Soul Power (Black Jungle)", and "Back in the Game" features both pop-rap hitmakers [[Trackmasters]] and [[soul music|soul]] legend [[Ronald Isley]]. Nick "Fury" Loftin also produces "One of These Days", sampling [[Donny Hathaway]]'s rendition of [[Ray Charles]]' "I Believe to My Soul" for its hook and using a fairly generic coupling of muffled [[horn stab]]s and soul guitar.

"Back in the Game" opens with the same vocal sample ("if what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous!") as 36 Chambers, but it sounds little like anything the Clan had done before; it also sounds little like well-known Trackmasters hits of the time, such as [[R. Kelly]]'s "Fiesta" (apart from its use of [[bongo drum|bongos]]). A delicate piano melody is layered over a heavy [[organ (music)|organ]] [[vamp (music)|vamp]] and a stumbling, complex rhythm.

A number of critics, such as the [[NME]]'s Ted Kessler and The Onion [[A.V. Club]]'s Nathan Rabin, saw Flavor Flav's appearance as a way to temporarily fill the clownish role of the absent Ol' Dirty Bastard. Flav sings the call-and-response chorus of "Soul Power (Black Jungle)" with U-God, and has a long conversation with Method Man in the song's outro about growing up in [[Long Island]], where Flav hails from.
