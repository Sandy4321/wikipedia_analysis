'''<U+00D8>rsta<U+2013>Volda Airport, Hovden''' ({{lang-no|<U+00D8>rsta<U+2013>Volda lufthamn, Hovden}}; {{Airport codes|HOV|ENOV|p=n}}) is a [[regional airport]] situated at [[Hovdebygda]] in [[<U+00D8>rsta]], [[Norway]], midway between the towns of [[<U+00D8>rsta (village)|<U+00D8>rsta]] and [[Volda (village)|Volda]]. The [[airport]] features a {{convert|1070|m|sp=us|adj=on}} asphalt [[runway]] aligned 06/24. Services are provided by [[Wider<U+00F8>e]] using their [[de Havilland Canada Dash 8]] as a [[public service obligation]]. Owned and operated by the state-owned [[Avinor]], the airport handled 121,021 passengers in 2014.

Hoved opened on 1 July 1971 as a municipal airport having cost 5.9 million [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK). Until 1993 Wider<U+00F8>e served it using the [[de Havilland Canada Twin Otter]] as a feeder service to [[<U+00C5>lesund Airport, Vigra]]. The [[de Havilland Canada Dash 7]] was used from 1985 to 1987. During the early years the airport had very poor regularity and was proposed closed. Terminal upgrades were carried out in 1988 and the runway extended in the early 2000s. Since the 2008 opening of the [[Eiksund Tunnel]] and the 2012 opening of the [[Kviv Tunnel], Hovden has significantly increased its [[catchment area]] and now covers a population of 60,000 in southern [[Sunnm<U+00F8>re]] and [[Nordfjord]]. This had led to a tripling of ridership.

==History==
The first aviation in Volda took place in 1935, when [[Gidsken Jakobsen]] demonstrated flights.<ref>Olsen-Hagen: 7</ref> The first airport in Sunnm<U+00F8>re and M<U+00F8>re og Romsdal was <U+00C5>lesund Airport, Vigra, which opened on 7 June 1958.<ref>Hjelle: 18</ref> For the southern parts of Sunnm<U+00F8>re the airport incurred a travel time of two to three hours, including two ferries.<ref name=oh8>Olsen-Hagen: 8</ref> [[M<U+00F8>re og Romsdal Fylkesb<U+00E5>tar]] introduced a [[hovercraft]] service from <U+00D8>rsta via [[Hareid]] to <U+00C5>lesund and Vigra in April 1965. Travel time from <U+00D8>rsta to the airport was 50 minutes. By the time of the fall storms the authorities withdrew the operating certificate due to safety concerns.<ref>Hjelle: 197</ref>

Following a 1962 government commission investigating the construction of new airports, Wider<U+00F8>e launched an alternative proposal and suggested that a network of smaller airports be built instead. These could be served using [[short take-off and landing]] aircraft, which were being developed at the time. Smaller airports could be built and operated at lower cost than larger airports, but both airports and airlines would need subsidies to operate. [[H<U+00E5>kon Kyllingmark]] was appointed [[Minister of Transport and Communications (Norway)|Minister of Transport and Communications]] in 1965 and was a proponent of the STOLport proposal. The political rationale was that, despite that the total operating costs would rise, it would provide better services to rural areas and thus keep up their population.<ref>Svanberg: 662<U+2013>663</ref>

The regional airports only received a simple terminal and a {{convert|800|m|sp=us|adj=on}} runway. The first such airports were opened in [[Helgeland]] in 1968.<ref name=forde>{{cite web |url=http://www.avinor.no/lufthavn/forde/omoss/75_Lufthavnens+historie |title=Lufthavnens historie |publisher=[[Avinor]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=3 October 2012 |archivedate=3 October 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6B8cU4nIy |deadurl=no}}</ref> Planning in <U+00D8>rsta and Volda commenced in February 1968, with the appointment of a inter-municipal commission.<ref name=oh8 /> It concluded that a side on the shore of Hovdentj<U+00F8>nna, a small lake, was a suitable site. It was estimated to cost NOK&nbsp;1.5 million. The plans were approved by [[Parliament of Norway|Parliament]] on 12 June 1969. In addition to <U+00D8>rsta<U+2013>Volda, these consisted of [[F<U+00F8>rde Airport, <U+00D8>yrane]]; [[Flor<U+00F8> Airport]] and [[Sogndal Airport, Hauk<U+00E5>sen]].<ref name=oh9>Olsen-Hagen: 9</ref>

Time until completion was set to two years and the responsibility was placed with the municipalities. The municipal councils approved the plans in early 1970 and an operating concession was granted by the government on 3 July. Construction was placed under the auspice of a committee with three representatives from each municipality and a representative from [[M<U+00F8>re og Romsdal County Municipality]].<ref name=oh9 /> The airport originally consisted of a {{convert|800|by|30|m|sp=us|adj=on}} runway and a apron measuring {{convert|70|by|35|m|sp=us}}.<ref>Arnesen: 116</ref> Navigation was provided by two [[radio beacon]]s. Of the investment of NOK&nbsp;5.3 million, the [[Ministry of Transport and Communications (Norway)|Ministry of Transport and Communications]] granted 2.97 million, the county 0.5 million and the remaining 1.8 million was loan.<ref name=oh9 />

[[File:<U+00D8>rsta-Volda Airport.jpg|thumb|The terminal building]]
Operating costs were covered by the two municipalities in the ratio of their population, initially nine sixteenth for <U+00D8>rsta and seven sixteenths for Volda. The airport was run by an inter-municipal board and subordinate the municipal engineer in <U+00D8>rsta. The four airports opened on 1 July 1971.<ref name=oh10>Olsen-Hagen: 10</ref> <U+00D8>rsta<U+2013>Volda Airport was one of three airports in M<U+00F8>re og Romsdal to open within two years. [[Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget]] opened on 30 June 1970<ref>Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 183</ref> and [[Molde Airport, <U+00C5>r<U+00F8>]] opened on 5 April 1972.<ref>Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 184</ref> This led to a dramatic reduction in services out of Vigra.<ref>Hjelle: 94</ref>

The original service from Hovden was a feeder service to Vigra operated by Wider<U+00F8>e with their 19-seat Twin Otters. In the first full year of operation the airport handled 8,835 passengers. During the first years the airport had notoriously poor regularity, and in the last quarter of 1972 half the flights were canceled. A contribution was the high {{convert|610|m|sp=us}} [[runway visual range]]. There were discussions of closing Hovden and [[Sandane Airport, Anda]] and replacing them with an airport at Markane in [[Stryn]], although this was never carried out.<ref name=oh10 />

[[File:Airlift AS-350.jpg|thumb|[[Eurocopter AS 350]] of [[Airlift (company)|Airlift]] at Hovden]]
Wider<U+00F8>e introduced the 50-passenger [[de Havilland Canada Dash 7]] on some routes between 1985 and 1988. There were 18,138 passengers in 1985 and 24,150 two years later. This and the use of the Dash 7 caused the terminal to be upgraded in 1988. New navigational aids were installed in 1987, including a [[localizer]] and a new radio beacon, lowering the visual range to {{convert|550|m|sp=us}}. Further improvements were made with the new runway lighting in 1989.<ref name=oh11>Olsen-Hagen: 11</ref> The Twin Otters were in 1993 replaced with Dash 8-100s. With this the flights to <U+00C5>lesund were terminated and isntead flights to [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu]] and [[Bergen Airport, Flesland]] were introduced. From 1997 Wider<U+00F8>e built a hangar at Hovden, allowing it to have a night stop there. This further helped regularity.<ref name=oh12>Olsen-Hagen: 12</ref>

Ownership of the airport passed to the Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor) on 1 January 1997.<ref>{{cite news |title=Staten kj<U+00F8>per flyplasser p<U+00E5> krita |last=Rapp |first=Ole Magnus |date=27 July 1994 |page=4 |work=[[Aftenposten]] |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The runway was extended in both directions in the early 2000s.<ref name=oh11 /> [[Airport security]] was introduced on 1 January 2005.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tre usikre flyplasser i Midt-Norge |last=Solberg |first=P<U+00E5>l E. |work=[[Adresseavisen]] |date=30 September 2004 |page=4 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Hovden saw 51,000 passengers in 2008. With the opening of the [[Eiksund Tunnel]] that year [[Ulstein]], [[Her<U+00F8>y]] and [[Hareid]] were all given a [[fixed link]] to the airport. This gave a large increase in use of the airport, hitting 100,000 passengers in 2011. The 2012 opening of the [[Kviv Tunnel]] brought the airport even closer to [[Nordfjord]] and Hovden started capturing patronage from Sandane Airport, Anda. This has been sufficient for Avinor to consider the closing of Anda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nrk.no/sognogfjordane/--sandane-lufthamn-kan-bli-nedlagt-1.11629852 |title=Ny rapport: Ferjefri E39 kan utarme Sandane lufthamn |last=Oldeide |first=Erlend Blaalid |last2=Grytli |first2=Anna |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=13 January 2015 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Combined these two road projects have tripled the airport's catchment area.<ref name=gynnild>{{cite web |url=http://avinor.moses.no/index.php?seks_id=135&element=kapittel&k=2 |title=Flyplassenes og flytrafikkens historie |work=Kulturminner p<U+00E5> norske lufthavner <U+2013> Landsverneplan for Avinor |publisher=[[Avinor]] |last=Gynnild |first=Olav |year=2009 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=25 January 2012 |archivedate=25 January 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DwQ1MXLE |deadurl=no}}</ref>
