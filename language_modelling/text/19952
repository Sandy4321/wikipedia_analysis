{{Politics of Bahrain}}
Women<U+2019>s political rights have been a cornerstone of the political reforms initiated by [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa|King Hamad]] with for the first time women being given the right to vote and stand as candidates in [[Elections in Bahrain|national elections]] after the constitution was amended in 2002. The extension of equal political rights has been accompanied by a self-conscious drive to promote women to positions of authority within government. 

The move to give women the vote in 2002 was part of a wide ranging political reforms that have seen the establishment of a democratically elected parliament and the release of political prisoners. Before 2002, women had no political rights and could neither vote in elections or stand as candidates.

There was though some ambiguity towards the extension of political rights from sections of Bahraini society, not least from women themselves with [http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=5888 60% of Bahraini women] in 2001 opposed to extending the vote to women. 

Although many women stood as candidates in both municipal and parliamentary elections in 2002 none were elected to office. Women candidates were conspicuous by their absence in the lists of [[Islamist]] parties such as [[Al Wefaq]], [[Al-Menbar Islamic Society]] and [[Asalah]]. 

Following the poor performance of women candidates in the parliamentary elections, six women including one Christian, were appointed to the upper chamber of parliament, the [[Consultative Council|Shura Council]]. In 2004, Bahrain appointed its first female minister, [[Dr Nada Haffadh]] to the position of Health Minister, and in 2005 a second woman minister was appointed to the cabinet. In April 2005, Shura member [[Alees Samaan]] became the first woman to chair a parliamentary session in the Arab world when she chaired the Shura Council. The head of the main women's organisation, the [[Supreme Council for Women]], Ms [[Lulwa Al Awadhi]], has been given the title of 'honorary cabinet minister'.  

In June 2006, Bahrain was elected head of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], and used the honour to appoint [[Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa|Haya bint Rashid Al Khalifa]] as the [[President of the United Nations General Assembly|Assembly's President]], making her the first Middle Eastern woman and only the third woman in history to take over the post. Sheikha Haya is a leading Bahraini lawyer and women's rights advocate who will take over the post at a time of change for the world body. UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] said of her, "I met her yesterday and I found her quite impressive. All the member states are determined to work with her and to support her, and I think she's going to bring a new dimension to the work here."[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/6/9/apworld/20060609085540&sec=apworld] 

Several women's rights activists have become political personalities in Bahrain in their own right, or even gain international recognition, such as [[Ghada Jamsheer]], who was named by [[Forbes| Forbes magazine]] as one of the "[http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=143558&Sn=BNEW&IssueID=29056  ten most powerful and effective women in the Arab world]" in May 2006. 

[[Ghada Jamsheer]], the most prominent women's rights activist in Bahrain<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/europe/html/060522/jamsheer.html Ghada Jamsheer], [[Time magazine]], May 14, 2006</ref> has called the government's reforms "artificial and marginal". In a statement in December 2006 she said:
{{cquote|The government is using the family law issue as a bargaining tool with opposition Islamic groups. This is evident through the fact that the authorities raise this issue when ever they want to distract attention from other controversial political issues. While no serious steps are taken to help approve this law, although the government and its puppet National Assembly had no trouble in the last four years when it came to approving restrictive laws related to basic freedoms.

All of this is why no one in Bahrain believes in Government clich<U+00E9>s and government institution like the [[Supreme Council for Women|High Council for Women]]. The government used women<U+2019>s rights as a decorative tool on the international level. While the High Council for Women was used to hinder non-governmental women societies and to block the registration of the Women Union for many years. Even when the union was recently registered, it was restricted by the law on societies.<ref>[http://chanad.weblogs.us/?p=516 Women in Bahrain and the Struggle Against Artificial Reforms], Ghada Jamsheer, 18 December 2006</ref>}}

Bahrain's move was widely credited with encouraging women's rights activists in the rest of the Persian Gulf to step up demands for equality. In 2005, it was announced that [[Kuwait| Kuwaiti women]] would be granted equal political rights to men. 

==Personal Status Law==

The most pressing issue for many Bahraini women is the lack of a unified family law or Personal Status Law as it is known, leaving matters of divorce and child custody to the discretion of [[Sharia]] judges, who have been criticised for a lack of consistency in their judgements. In November 2005, the [[Supreme Council for Women]] in an alliance with other women's rights activists began a campaign for change - organising demonstrations, putting up posters across the island and carrying out a series of media interviews (see [http://www.scw.gov.bh/conf/index.asp Supreme Council's website for full details in Arabic]). 

However, reform of the law has been resisted by the leading [[Shia]] [[Islamist]] party, [[Al Wefaq]], resulting in a major [http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/1yr_arc_Articles.asp?Article=126583&Sn=BNEW&IssueID=28235&date=11/10/2005 political showdown] with women's rights activists.  Al Wefaq has stated that neither [[Chamber of Deputies|elected MPs]] nor the government have authority to change the law because these institutions could 'misinterpret the word of God'. Instead the right to reform the law is the sole responsibility of religious leaders.

In 9 November 2005, supporters of Al Wefaq claimed to have organised Bahrain's largest ever demonstration with 120,000 protesting against the introduction of the Personal Status Law, and for the maintenance of each religious group having their own divorce and inheritance laws. On the same day an alliance of women's rights organisations held a rally calling for the unified law, but this attracted only 500 supporters.

The issue of the introduction of a unified Personal Status Law has divided civil society into two camps, with women's rights and human rights groups wanting its introduction opposed by Shia Islamist groups in alliance with the [[wahabbi]] [[Asalah]]:

==2006 Election==

Eighteen female candidates are contesting Bahrain's parliamentary elections on 25 November 2006, with one candidate, [[Lateefa Al Gaood]], winning by default even before polling after her two opponents in her constituency dropped out of the race. Most of the women are running for Leftist parties or as independents, with no Islamist party being represented by a woman, although salafist party [[Asalah]] is the only group to publicly oppose women's candidature in parliamentary elections.
