====Printed adaptations====
A [[manga]] based on the ''Kingdom Hearts'' storyline has been released in Japan and the United States. The story and art are done by [[Shiro Amano]], who is also known for his manga adaptation of the ''[[Legend of Mana]]'' video game.

===Disney and ''Square Enix'' characters===
{{Further|Characters of Kingdom Hearts}}
''Kingdom Hearts'' features a mixture of familiar Disney and ''Square Enix'' characters, as well as several new characters designed and created by Nomura.<ref name="GS-CompanyLine">{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/kingdomhearts/news.html?sid=6089696| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| title = Kingdom Hearts Company Line| accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> In addition to original locations, the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series features many worlds from Disney films. [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] must visit these worlds and interact with various Disney characters to protect them from enemies. Often, his actions in these worlds closely follow the storylines of their respective Disney films. The main characters try not to interfere with the affairs of other worlds, as it could negatively affect the universe's order.<ref>'''Donald:''' But we can<U+2019>t.

Page 99. Tokyopop.</ref> [[Moogle]]s, small creatures from the ''Final Fantasy'' series, are another common element in the games. They provide the player with a synthesis shop in order to create and purchase items used in the game. So far, twenty-one characters from the Final Fantasy Series have appeared in the Kingdom Hearts games. The main cast from ''The World Ends with You'' also makes an appearance in the series as seen in Dream Drop Distance.

===Story===
The series starts with ''Kingdom Hearts'' showing how [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] is separated from his friends [[Riku (Kingdom Hearts)|Riku]] and [[Kairi (Kingdom Hearts)|Kairi]] when their world, [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Original worlds|Destiny Islands]], is invaded by creatures known as the [[Nobodies|Heartless]]. During the invasion, Sora obtains a weapon called the Keyblade that allows him to fight the Heartless. He soon arrives in another world, Traverse Town, where he meets [[Donald Duck]] and [[Goofy]], two emissaries from Disney Castle sent by [[Mickey Mouse|King Mickey]] to find the wielder of the Keyblade.<ref name="KHgamespy">{{cite web| url = http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/kingdom-hearts/540394p1.html| title = Kingdom Hearts Review (PS2)| author=Turner, Benjamin | date=September 3, 2002 | publisher = [[GameSpy]]| accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref><ref name="MickeyNote">'''King Mickey's Note:''' Donald, Sorry to rush off without sayin' goodbye, nevertheless, there's big trouble brewin'.

Along the way, they encounter a group of Disney villains led by [[Maleficent]], who are controlling the Heartless to capture maidens called the "[[Princesses of Heart]]", and use their power to open the door to "[[Kingdom hearts (place)|Kingdom Hearts]]" and rule over all the worlds.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/136/136467p1.html| title = Kingdom Hearts Preview| publisher = IGN| author = Dave Zdyrko| date = 2002-02-06| accessdate = 2007-09-05}}</ref><ref name="KH-MobyGames">{{cite web| url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/kingdom-hearts/| publisher = [[MobyGames]]| title = Kingdom Hearts for PlayStation 2 (2002)| accessdate=2012-10-18}}</ref> Though they eventually defeat Maleficent, the three discover that [[Ansem (Xehanort)|Ansem]] (Xehanort's Heartless) has been using Maleficent and plans to attain eternal darkness by opening Kingdom Hearts himself. Sora, Donald, and Goofy defeat Ansem and seal the door to Kingdom Hearts with the help of Riku and King Mickey on the other side of the door.

In ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories'', Sora and his two friends begin searching for Riku and King Mickey. They arrive at a fortress called Castle Oblivion,<ref>'''Donald:''' Well, now what do we do? / '''Sora:''' We've gotta find Riku and King Mickey. {{cite video game| title = Kingdom Hearts| developer = Square | publisher = Square Electronic Arts | date= 2002-11-15 |platform= PlayStation 2}}</ref><ref name="COM-StrategyGuide">{{cite book| last= Hollinger| first= Elizabeth| year = 2004| title = Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Official Strategy Guide| publisher = [[BradyGames]] Publishing| isbn= 0-7440-0473-X| oclc= 122414850}}</ref> where they encounter members of a mysterious group called [[Organization XIII]], which is made up of non-existent beings called the [[Nobodies]].

At the end of the year in ''Kingdom Hearts II'', Sora and friends awaken from their sleep and resume their search for Riku and King Mickey, learning of the Nobodies and becoming re-familiarized with Organization XIII.  Sora once again travels to many Disney-themed worlds and resolves the troubles caused by the Heartless and Nobodies. They eventually reunite with King Mickey and encounter [[Xemnas]], the Nobody of Xehanort and the leader of Organization XIII.<ref name=fakeansem>'''Mickey:''' But, what you actually fought was his Heartless.

Another year later, Sora, Riku and Kairi receive a message from King Mickey's detailing how the three became who they are now that Namin<U+00E9> learned of while restoring Sora's memory and left a message in Jiminy's journal that Mickey discovered during the events of ''Kingdom Hearts coded''. As they read the letter, learn of the exploits of the three Keyblade wielders' fates during the events of ''Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep'' (a decade before ''Kingdom Hearts'') by the hands of [[Master Xehanort]] (the true Xehanort and an old Keyblade Master) trying to recreate the legendary <U+03C7>-Blade which all Keyblades are modeled after and plunge the worlds into chaos: [[Terra (Kingdom Hearts)|Terra]] was converted into Xehanort's new vessel whose experiments later turned his heart into "Ansem" and his body into Xemnas, [[Ventus (Kingdom Hearts)|Ventus]] sacrificed himself to defeat his dark doppelganger [[Vanitas (Kingdom Hearts)|Vanitas]] to stop Xehanort's plan to obtain the <U+03C7>-Blade to which his body was placed somewhere within Castle Oblivion while his heart ended up with the body of Sora himself, and new Keyblade Master [[Aqua (Kingdom Hearts)|Aqua]] ended up in the Realm of Darkness. King Mickey also discovers that the destruction of "Ansem" and Xemnas has led to the reconstruction of Master Xehanort. To combat the new threat Xehanort poses, Sora and Riku take an exam to attain the Mark of Mastery that will allow them to become Keyblade Masters themselves.

During the test in ''Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance'', Sora and Riku enter into the Realm of Sleep where they encounter a young version of Xehanort with the ability to travel through time. The two Keyblade wielders also learn of Xehanort's true goal: creating thirteen replicas of himself by placing a piece of his own heart in each "host", thus infecting the body's original heart and taking it over then will pit them against seven hearts of pure light in an ultimate battle to recreate the <U+03C7>-Blade once more. Though the Organization was defeated, Xehanort expected it and became "Ansem" for the purpose of giving his younger self the ability to travel through time and gather other versions of Xehanort together to form the true Organization XIII, the Thirteen Seekers of Darknesses. Though Sora is narrowly saved from becoming Xehanort's final vessel with the aid of Lea, Axel's original self, Riku entered Sora's body to wake him from the nightmare Xehanort placed him in. In the process, meeting Roxas, Ventus, and Xion within Sora's mind, Riku learned from a digital copy of Ansem the Wise that reveals the data he implanted in Sora and how he may be able to save both those who are lost and those that ceased to be. At the end of the exam, only Riku is declared a Keyblade Master while Sora embarks on a new journey by himself to train. In the meanwhile, left with no other option as he feared the Princesses of Heart would be dragged into the conflict, Yen Sid resolves to form the Seven Guardians of Light from any available Keyblade user (including Kairi) to combat the Thirteen Darknesses in the upcoming final battle.

===Gameplay===
The ''Kingdom Hearts'' games contain elements of both [[action game|action]] and [[role-playing video game]]s. The games are driven by a linear progression from one story event to the next, usually shown in the form of a [[cutscene]], though there are numerous [[Quest (gaming)|side quests]] available that provide bonus benefits to the characters. In most games, the player primarily controls the principal protagonist of the series, [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]]. Sora is usually accompanied by [[Donald Duck]] and [[Goofy]], who are [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence-controlled]] [[Non-player characters|non-playable characters]] that aid Sora in battle. In the first and third game, their behavior can be altered to suit different combat objectives. The games feature real-time combat that incorporates physical attacks, magic, and summonings, though each game handles battles differently.

[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)#Gummi Ship|Gummi Ships]] are another common element of the series, which serve as the main mode of transportation between worlds in the games. The gameplay for the Gummi Ship sections is more akin to a [[Shoot 'em up|rail shooter]]. Because it received negative criticism in the first game, it was modified in the third title.<ref name="KHU-NI1UP">{{cite web| url = http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI/1UP-2| title = 1UP - E3 2005 Interview| publisher = Kingdom Hearts Ultimania| accessdate = 2007-08-31| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070808165059/http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI/1UP-2| archivedate = August 8, 2007}}</ref> Most games also feature a journal which is accessible from the main menu. This journal keeps track of information regarding the story, characters, enemies, and locations. In the first three games, the journal is kept by [[Jiminy Cricket]], who was appointed by [[Minnie Mouse|Queen Minnie]] as the royal chronicler.<ref>'''Minnie:''' Oh, and to chronicle your travels, he will accompany you. / '''Jiminy:''' Over here!

Jiminy Cricket, at your service. {{cite video game| title = Kingdom Hearts| developer = Square | publisher = Square Electronic Arts | date= 2002-11-15 |platform= PlayStation 2}}</ref> In ''358/2 Days'', ''Birth by Sleep'' and ''Dream Drop Distance'', the main characters write their own journal entries.

[[File:Kingdom Hearts Battle Screenshot.png|thumb|A battle in the first ''Kingdom Hearts'' game]]
The games are influenced by their parent franchise, ''[[Final Fantasy]]'',<ref>{{Cite news |date= July 2007|title= Tetsuya Nomura Interview|periodical= [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|publisher= [[Future Publishing]]|volume= |issue= 177|pages= 80<U+2013>81|id= |url=  |postscript= <!--None-->}}</ref> and carry its gameplay elements over into their own action-based, [[hack and slash|hack-and-slash]] system. Like many traditional role-playing games, ''Kingdom Hearts'' features an [[experience point]] system which determines character development.

==Development==
===History===
The initial idea for ''Kingdom Hearts'' began with a discussion between [[Shinji Hashimoto]] and [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] about ''[[Super Mario 64]]''.<ref name="KH3DIwata">{{cite web|url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/3ds/creators/11/0 |title=Iwata Asks |publisher=Iwataasks.nintendo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-04}}</ref> They were planning to make a game with freedom of movement in three dimensions like ''Super Mario 64'' but lamented that only characters as popular as Disney's could rival a Mario game. Tetsuya Nomura, overhearing their conversation, volunteered to lead the project and the two producers agreed to let him direct.<ref name="KH3DIwata"/> A chance meeting between Hashimoto and a Disney executive in an elevator<U+2014>Square and Disney had previously worked in the same building in Japan<U+2014>allowed Hashimoto to pitch the idea directly to Disney.<ref>{{cite video| date=2007-10-10| url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/part-xi-final-fantasy/26204| title=Final Fantasy Retrospective Part XI| medium=GameTrailers.com feature| publisher=[[GameTrailers]]| accessdate=2007-11-20}}</ref><ref name="IGN-TGS04-NI">{{cite web| publisher = IGN| title = TGS 2004: Tetsuya Nomura Q&A| url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/550/550462p1.html| author = Anoop Gantayat| date = 2004-09-23| accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref> Development in February 2000 with Nomura as director and Hashimoto as producer.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://ffx.sakura.ne.jp/kh.htm| title = Kingdom Hearts <U+30AD><U+30F3><U+30B0><U+30C0><U+30E0> <U+30CF><U+30FC><U+30C4>| publisher = ''Final Fantasy'' 2000| language = Japanese| accessdate = 2007-05-30}}</ref> While Nomura had done previous work in the ''Final Fantasy'' series as monster designer and graphic director, he did not gain widespread recognition until he was the lead character designer for ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''. ''Kingdom Hearts'' marked his transition into a directorial position, though he also served as the game's character designer. Scenarios were provided by [[Kazushige Nojima]] who was a scenario writer for Square from ''Final Fantasy VII'' until he left in 2003. Originally the development focused on the gameplay with a simple story to appeal to Disney's target age range. After ''Kingdom Hearts'' executive producer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] told Nomura the game would be a failure if it did not aim for the same level as the ''Final Fantasy'' series, he began to develop the story further.<ref name="Insider-KHU-NI">{{cite web| url = http://www.khinsider.com/content/view/42/41/| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/64xK2Fual| archivedate = 2012-01-25| title = KHU Interview w/Tetsuya Nomura| publisher = Kingdom Hearts Insider| accessdate = 2007-08-10}}</ref>

Nomura placed a secret trailer in ''Kingdom Hearts'' in hopes that fans would want a sequel. He was unsure if fans would want a sequel and felt that if they did not, then it would be best to leave certain events in the first game unexplained.<ref name="KH-NI-KHIIU">{{cite web| title = Kingdom Hearts II Ultimania - Tetsuya Nomura Interview| url = http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI/KH2U| publisher = Kingdom Hearts Ultimania| accessdate = 2007-08-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070710094227/http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI/KH2U <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-07-10}}</ref> After ''[[Kingdom Hearts Final Mix]]'' was completed, development for ''Kingdom Hearts II'' began.<ref name="GS-NI-Dengeki">{{cite web| author = GameSpot staff| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/kingdomhearts2/news.html?sid=6076646| date = 2003-10-10| title = ''Kingdom Hearts'' II's Tetsuya Nomura Q & A| accessdate = 2007-06-15}}</ref> There were several obstacles to clear before development could begin on a sequel.

Nomura does this because he feels that games should have room for fans to speculate and use their imagination. He has stated that with speculation, even though a game gets old, people can still be happy with it. Also, Vincent Kessler wanted a new video game in the world; so it was Nomura's duty to give him just that. <ref name="KH-NI-KHIIU"/>

===Promotion===
The first ''Kingdom Hearts'' was announced at [[E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo)|E3]] in May 2001.<ref name="GS-CompanyLine"/> Initial details were that it would be a collaboration between Square and Disney Interactive, and would feature worlds developed by both companies and Disney characters. New characters were designed by Nomura and include Sora, Riku, Kairi, and the Heartless.<ref name="GS-CompanyLine"/><ref name="GS-E3-2001">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/kingdomhearts/news.html?sid=2761861| author = Gerstmann, Jeff | date=2001-05-17| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| title = E3 2001: Square announces Disney RPG for PS2| accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref> On May 14, 2002, a press release announced a list of the English voice actors. The list included Haley Joel Osment, David Gallagher, and Hayden Panettiere as the three new characters introduced in the game. It was also announced that many of the Disney characters would be voiced by the official voice actors from their respective Disney films.<ref name="GS-CompanyLine"/><ref>{{cite web| url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/359/359415p1.html| author = IGN Staff| publisher = IGN| title = IGN: Kingdom Hearts Voice Cast| accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref>

A secret trailer in the first ''Kingdom Hearts'' and ''Kingdom Hearts Final Mix'' hinted at the possibility of a sequel. Rumors for a sequel on the PlayStation 2 were spurred in Japan when a Japanese video game site, Quiter, stated that "an internal (and anonymous) source at Square Japan" confirmed that development of ''Kingdom Hearts II'' had begun.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/388/388537p1.html| title = Kingdom Hearts 2 on PS2?| publisher = IGN| author = IGN staff| date = 2003-03-07| accessdate = June 14, 2007}}</ref> It was not until ''Kingdom Hearts II'' was announced, along with ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories'', at the [[Tokyo Game Show]] in September 2003 that rumors were confirmed.<ref name="KH-Sequels-GS">{{cite web| author = Justin Calvert| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| title = TGS 2003: Kingdom Hearts sequels announced| url = http://www.gamespot.com/gba/rpg/kingdomheartschainofmemories/news.html?sid=6075893| date = 2003-09-26| accessdate = June 8, 2007}}</ref> Initial details were that it would take place some time after ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories'', which takes place directly after the first game. Other details included the return of Sora, Donald, and Goofy, as well as new costumes. At the 2004 Square Enix E3 press conference, the producer, Shinji Hashimoto, stated that many mysteries of the first game would be answered.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gaming-age.com/event/2004/e3/12-60| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/658G4ZV9w| archivedate = 2012-02-01| title = Square Enix E3 Press Conference and "Dear Friends" Concert| publisher = Gaming Age| date = 2004-05-12| author = Benson, Mike| accessdate = 2007-09-25}}</ref>

To help market the games, websites were set up for each game and demos were on display at gaming events. Each game in the main series was also re-released in Japan with additional content and served as [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] updates to the series.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.neoseeker.com/Games/Products/PS2/kingdomhearts_final/| publisher = Neoseeker| title = Kingdom Hearts: Final Mix (Import)| accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| language = Japanese| title = <U+300C><U+30AD><U+30F3><U+30B0><U+30C0><U+30E0> <U+30CF><U+30FC><U+30C4>II <U+30D5><U+30A1><U+30A4><U+30CA><U+30EB> <U+30DF><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30B9><U+300D><U+306B><U+65B0><U+8981><U+7D20><U+304C>!!| url = http://www.famitsu.com/game/coming/2007/03/23/104,1174620771,68873,0,0.html| publisher = [[Famitsu]]| date = 2007-03-24| accessdate = 2007-07-06}}</ref> The additional content foreshadowed later plot elements in the series. The rereleases of the main series games had the term "Final Mix" added after the title, while ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories'' and ''Kingdom Hearts coded'' were re-released as ''Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories'' and ''Kingdom Hearts Re:coded'' and released on the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS, respectively, with 3D graphics, voice overs during some cutscenes, and new game content.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://ps2.ign.com/objects/853/853598.html| title = Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix| publisher = IGN| accessdate = 2007-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.play-asia.com/paOS-13-71-43-49-en-70-1xlx.html| publisher = Play-Asia| title = Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix+ (Limited Package Version)| accessdate = 2007-06-21}}</ref>

===Musical score===
{{Further|Music of Kingdom Hearts}}
The music for the video game series was primarily composed by [[Yoko Shimomura]]. [[Kaoru Wada]] works as the arranger for orchestral music in the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series, including orchestral renditions of the main vocal themes and the ending themes.<ref name="KH-OST">[[Kingdom Hearts Original Soundtrack]] CD insert.

While the themes for some of the Disney-based worlds are taken directly from their Disney film counterparts,<ref name="KHII-OST"/> most of them are given entirely original musical scores. In addition to each world having unique background music, each is given its own battle theme rather than having a common theme to cover all fights. Several of the main characters have themes, and the final boss of each game has several themes played in the various phases of those fights. The fights with [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]] feature a modified version of [[Nobuo Uematsu]]'s "[[One-Winged Angel]]" from ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''.<ref name="OST-Box"/>

The main [[theme song]]s for the ''Kingdom Hearts'' games were written and performed by Japanese pop star, [[Utada Hikaru]]. The two main themes are "[[Hikari (song)|Hikari]]", from ''Kingdom Hearts'' and ''Chain of Memories'',<ref>{{cite web| author = IGN Staff| publisher = IGN| url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/100/100803p1.html| title = Hikaru Utada Sings ''Kingdom Hearts'' Theme| accessdate = May 13, 2007| date = 2002-01-10}}</ref> and "[[Passion (single)|Passion]]", from ''Kingdom Hearts II''.<ref>{{cite web| author = Hirohiko Niizumi| url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/kingdomhearts2/news.html?sid=6130068| publisher = GameSpot| date = 2005-07-29| title = ''Kingdom Hearts'' vocalist returns for sequel| accessdate = June 15, 2007}}</ref> Each song has an English counterpart, "[[Simple and Clean]]" and "[[Sanctuary (Utada song)|Sanctuary]]" respectively, for the North American and European releases.
