'''John Carlyle Garrels''' (November 18, 1885 &ndash; October 21, 1956) was an [[United States|American]] athlete.  He won the [[silver medal]] in the men's 110 metres hurdles race and a bronze medal in the [[shot put]] at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]].  He was also a starting [[End (American football)|left end]] and [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] for the [[1904 Michigan Wolverines football team|1904]], [[1905 Michigan Wolverines football team|1905]], and [[1906 Michigan Wolverines football team]]s.

==Early years==
Garrels was born in [[Bay City, Michigan]] in 1885.  His father was a printer.  He attended [[Central High School (Detroit, Michigan)|Central High School]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]], serving as class president.<ref>{{cite news|title=School Graduates|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=June 19, 1902|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1758301602.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Jun+19,+1902&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&desc=SCHOOL+GRADUATES&pqatl=google}}</ref> 

In March 1903, Garrels won the all-round indoor championship of the YMCA at a meet held in Detroit.  At age 17, Garrels scored 21 points at the meet with first place finishes in the fence vault (6 feet, 9 inches), running high kick (9 feet), hop, step and jump (27 feet, 5 inches), and second place finishes in the shot put and running high jump.<ref>{{cite news|title=Garrels Won High Honors: Captured Indoor Championship at Y.M.C.A.

==University of Michigan==
Garrels enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1903 and received a degree in chemical engineering in 1907.  While attending Michigan, Garrels became one of the most accomplished athletes in the university's history.  He excelled as a member of Michigan's football teams from 1904 to 1906 and as a member of its track and field team from 1904 to 1907.  He was also a member of the [[Tau Beta Pi]] fraternity and the Michigamua and Vulcan societies at Michigan.<ref>{{cite book|title=Michiganensian|year=1907|page=111|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa&cc=moa&idno=aag4364.1907.001&q1=garrels&view=image&seq=111&size=300}}</ref>

===Track and field===
[[File:John Garrels.png|thumb|right|135px|Garrels holding discus]]
In April 1904, Garrels, while still a freshman, demonstrated his ability by throwing the discus "around 118 and 119 feet" -- a distance that would have won the event at the prior week's Philadelphia meet.  Garrels announced at the time that he intended to make a specialty of the discus throw.<ref>{{cite news|title=Garrels Will Stick To Discus Throwing|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=April 27, 1904|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1765808852.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Apr+27,+1904&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=3&desc=GARRELS+WILL+STICK+TO+DISCUS+THROWING}}</ref>

In April 1905, while competing at a meet in Philadelphia, Garrels threw the discus a distance of 135 feet and one-half inch, which exceeded the established world record of 128 feet, 10-1/2 inches.<ref>{{cite news|title=GARRELS TOSSES DISCUS BEYOND WORLD'S MARK|newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=April 12, 1905|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1767220122.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Apr+12,+1905&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=10&desc=GARRELS+TOSSES+DISCUS+BEYOND+WORLD'S+MARK}}</ref>  However, AAU officials ruled that the discus used by Garrels "did not comply strictly with AAU regulations."<ref name=DFP1/>  (The discus used by Garrels had an aluminum rim, but complied with the regulations in all other respects.<ref>{{cite news|title=Michigan's Third Victory at Philadelphia|publisher=The Michigan Alumnus|date=May 1905|page=373|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hIQqAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>)  Two months later, when Garrels competed at the [[Big Ten Conference|Western Conference]] track meet in Chicago, he took care to ensure that the discus he used complied with all regulations in the opinion of the officials present at the meet.  At that meet, Garrels threw the discus 140 feet, 2-3/8 inches, shattering the old world record by nearly 12 feet.  Officials at the meet listed the toss as a new world record, but AAU officials again rejected the record, contending that "the discus used was not constructed on the official lines laid down by the A.A.U."<ref name=DFP1>{{cite news|title=GARRELS AGAIN ROBBED OF HONORS, A.

At the Western Conference meet in June 1906, Garrels won 18 points -- "more than any whole college team outside of Michigan and Chicago."<ref name=Capt>{{cite news|title=Garrels Track Captain: But Rule Will Have To Be Changed If He Serves|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=June 4, 1906|url=}}</ref>  At the 1906 conference meet, Garrels equaled the world's record in the 120-yard hurdles, but AAU officials ruled that his time would not qualify for the world record, as he had displaced two hurdles during the race.  Under the AAU rules in effect at the time, all hurdles must be standing at the end of the race.  Garrels' time did qualify, however, as a new Western Conference record.<ref>{{cite news|title=Will Not Accept Garrels's Record|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 5, 1906|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=FA0713FD395512738DDDAC0894DE405B868CF1D3}}</ref>  Following the 1906 conference meet, Garrels was elected captain of the 1907 tack team.<ref name=Capt/>

At the 1907 Eastern Intercollegiate meet in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], Garrels scored 13 points by winning the high hurdles in world record time (15-1/5 seconds), and also winning the low hurdles (24 seconds) and placing second in the shot put (45 feet, 2 inches).<ref name=Murphy/>  His point total was the highest of any athlete at the meet.  However, the executive committee of the AAU later ruled that the mark would not qualify as a world record, because the wind was at his back.  The ''Detroit Free Press'' noted, "For a world-beater, Garrels has been unlucky in official recognition."<ref>{{cite news|title=Garrels in Hard Luck: Once Again Detroit Boy Knocked Out of a Record|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=October 25, 1907|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1775498902.html?FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Oct+25,+1907&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=8&desc=GARRELS+IN+HARD+LUCK}}</ref>

In 1932, long-time Michigan and Princeton track coach [[Keene Fitzpatrick]], who trained multiple Olympic gold medalists, called Garrels the best all-around athlete he ever handled.<ref name=Trum>{{cite news|author=[[Walter S.

===Football===
Garrels also played for [[Fielding H. Yost]]'s [[Michigan Wolverines football]] teams from 1904 to 1906.

As a sophomore, Garrels was the starting left end in six of ten games for the undefeated [[1904 Michigan Wolverines football team|1904 "Point-a-Minute" team]] that outscored its opponents 567&ndash;22.<ref name=t04>{{cite web|title=1904 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1904fbt.htm}}</ref>

As a junior, Garrels started all 13 games as the left end for the [[1905 Michigan Wolverines football team|1905 "Point-a-Minute" team]] that outscored opponents 495&ndash;2.<ref name=t05>{{cite web|title=1905 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1905fbt.htm}}</ref>  Garrels was the second leading scorer on the 1905 team (behind Tom Hammond and Joe Curtis) with seven touchdowns and eight extra point kicks for a total of 43 points.<ref>Scoring statistics are set forth in the article on the 1905 team and are derived from box scores published in 1905 by the ''Detroit Free Press'' and ''The Michigan Alumnus''.</ref>  Michigan's sole setback in 1905 was a 2&ndash;0 loss to the University of Chicago team.  Garrels had the longest run of the game, a 35-yard run around Chicago's left end.  Garrels was stopped by Chicago All-American [[Walter Eckersall]].  The ''Detroit Free Press'' wrote: "Had there been interference near enough to brush off Eckersall, Michigan would have scored an easy touchdown and victory."<ref name=DFP2>{{cite news|title=Johnnie Garrels, Detroit Boy, Proved Star of Yost's Grid Warriors|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=December 1, 1905|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1765224452.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Dec+1,+1905&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=9&desc=JOHNNIE+GARRELS,+DETROIT+BOY,+PROVED+STAR+OF+YOST'S+GRID+WARRIORS}}</ref>  At the end of the 1905 season, the ''Detroit Free Press'' rated him as the "Star of Yost's Grid Warriors," adding, "If there was a man who stood out prominently, it was Johnnie Garrels."<ref name=DFP2/>

As a senior, Garrels was moved to the [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] position, starting all six games at the position for the [[1906 Michigan Wolverines football team]] that finished the season with a record of 4&ndash;1.<ref name=t06>{{cite web|title=1906 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1906fbt.htm}}</ref>  Michigan easily won its first three games in 1906 against Case (28&ndash;0), Ohio State (6&ndash;0) and Illinois (28&ndash;9).  The game against Case marked the first game at [[Ferry Field]], and Garrels scored the Wolverines' first touchdown in the new stadium.  He also returned the opening kickoff 95 yards against Illinois.<ref name=LH>[http://www.mgoblue.com/genrel/050406aab.html 100 Years of Ferry Field (1996-2006)], by Leah Howard.</ref>

In the fourth game of the 1906 season, Michigan narrowly defeated Vanderbilt by a score of 10&ndash;4.  Garrels accounted for nine of Michigan's ten points with a field goal from the 25-yard line in the first half and a touchdown run that has been reported as either 65 or 75 yards on a fake punt in the second half.<ref name=LH/><ref>{{cite news|title=Garrel's [sic] Long Run Saves Michigan|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 4, 1906|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F20A1EF7395512738DDDAD0894D9415B868CF1D3}}</ref>  Following the Vandebilt game, ''The Pittsburg Press'' wrote:<blockquote>"Garrels is the best fullback in the West, and probably has no equal in the country.  Weighing 200 pounds, he is a wonderfully speedy runner, capable of covering the 100 yards in 10 seconds.  He is a find punter, place and drop kicker, tackles well, and is a great line plunger."<ref name=PP/></blockquote>

In his final game for Michigan's football team, the Wolverines lost 17-0 to Penn.  The Wolverines had lost their captain, Joe Curtis, the week before the Penn game, and Garrels was named captain for the Penn game.<ref name=PP>{{cite news|title=Michigan's New Leader|The Pittsburg Press|date=November 18, 1906|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MQ8bAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tkgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3862,4255525&dq=garrels&hl=en}}</ref>  With Curtis out of the lineup, Penn's efforts were concentrated on Garrels, and "his every attempt at an end run or a fake kick" were stopped.  Despite the loss, Garrels was credited with playing a "star game," as the ''Detroit Free Press'' observed, "The sum and substance of the failure of Garrels to do much today was the great playing of Pennsylvania's ends and the almost total lack of interference by the Michigan halfbacks for him."<ref name=DFP3>{{cite news|author=Seward Cramer|title=Maize and Blue Goes Down To Defeat Before the Speedy Men of Pennsy: Outplayed Throughout, Michigan Loses, 17 to 0; Easterners Had it on Yost's Eleven at Both Old and New Football; Garrels Played Star Game|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=November 18, 1906|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1742375732.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+18,+1906&author=SEWARD+CRAMER&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=1&desc=MAIZE+AND+BLUE+GOES+DOWN+TO+DEFEAT+BEFORE+THE+SPEEDY+MEN+OF+PENNSY.}}</ref>

==1908 Summer Olympics==
After graduating from Michigan in 1907, Garrels trained with the Chicago Athletic Association in preparation for the [[1908 Summer Olympics]].  

In May 1908, as the Olympic trials approached, sports reporter H.V. Valentine wrote, "No figure in the world of athletics is attracting more attention these days than that of John G.

In early June 1908, the American Olympic Committee announced its selections to compete in the 1908 summer games in London.  Garrels was selected to compete for the United States in the 110-meter hurdles, discus, Greek discus and shot put.<ref>{{cite news|title=American Entries Cabled to London|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 10, 1908|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=FA0C16FE3E5A17738DDDA90994DE405B888CF1D3}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=We Have Done the Best We Know How|newspaper=The Deseret News|date=June 9, 1908|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GUQwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YUgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6401,2691428&dq=garrels&hl=en}}</ref>

In late June 1908, days before sailing for London, Garrels competed in the AAU meet in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].  Garrels took first place in the 110-meter hurdles (15-3/5 seconds), the discus throw (132 feet, 8 inches) and the shot put (42 feet, 10 inches).<ref>{{cite news|title=GARRELS WINS THREE EVENTS AT PITTSBURG: Detroit Boy Star of the A.
