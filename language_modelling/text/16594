'''Sarah Bezra Nicol''' ( <U+2013> 1834 or after) was a British actress who became known for playing older women character roles in [[Edinburgh]].

==Life==
Sarah's birth name is unknown. At the end of the 18th century she was first noticed as a servant to Colonel and the Hon. Mrs Milner. They encouraged her after she joined an amateur dramatic society known as the "Shakespearean Society of London" which put on plays in a small theatre in [[Tottenham Court Road]]. The Milners saw her appear in [[Venice Preserv'd]] and they supported her in her ambitions and she went on to act outside London. She soon became "Mrs. Nicol" <U+2013> her husband worked as a printer <U+2013> and this was the name under which all her subsequent work was done. In 1800 she gave birth to [[Emma Nicol]] who was the first of four daughters who were to become actresses.<ref name=odnb>J.

In 1823 Mrs Nicol was engraved as Miss Grizelda Oldbuck by [[William Home Lizars]]. She had played that part at the Theatre Royal in an adaptation of [[Walter Scott]]'s novel ''[[The Antiquary]]''.<ref>[http://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/UoEwal~1~1~58991~100410:Mrs--Nicol-of-the-Theatre-Royal-Edi# Mrs. Nicol of the Theatre Royal Edinburgh as Miss Grizelda Oldbuckthe National Drama]</ref>

By 1833 her mother was too elderly to get regular work and she died sometime after her farewell performance at a benefit in 1834.<ref name=odnb/> By November 1834 Emma was back in Edinburgh playing the type of roles her mother had played at the Theatre Royal. It was noticed that she had developed her skills considerably since she had left which enabled her to play the roles that her mother had made her own.<ref name=dibdin>{{cite book|last1=Dibdin|first1=James C.|title=The Annals of the Edinburgh Stage|date=1823|page=476|url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/james-c-dibdin/the-annals-of-the-edinburgh-stage-with-an-account-of-the-rise-and-progress-of-dr-hci/page-49-the-annals-of-the-edinburgh-stage-with-an-account-of-the-rise-and-progress-of-dr-hci.shtml}}</ref>
