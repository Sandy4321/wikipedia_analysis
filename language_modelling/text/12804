'''Francis II R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi''' ({{lang-hu|II. R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi Ferenc}}, Hungarian pronunciation: {{IPAc-hu|'|r|<U+00E1>|k|<U+00F3>|c|i|-|'|f|e|r|e|n|c}}; 27 March 1676 in [[Bor<U+0161>a|Borsi]], [[Royal Hungary]] <U+2013> 8 April 1735 in [[Tekirda<U+011F>]], [[Ottoman Empire]]) Hungarian aristocrat,<ref>"[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761559741/Hungary.html Hungary]," Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2008. [http://www.webcitation.org/5kwpv63Mu Archived] 2009-10-31.</ref> he was the leader of the Hungarian uprising against the [[Habsburg]]s in 1703-11 as the prince (''fejedelem'') of the Estates Confederated for Liberty of the Kingdom of Hungary. He was also [[Rulers of Transylvania|Prince of Transylvania]], an Imperial Prince, and a member of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]]. Today he is considered a national hero in Hungary.

His full title was:
'''''Franciscus II.''' Dei Gratia Sacri Romani Imperii & Transylvaniae princeps '''Rakoczi'''. Particum Regni Hungariae Dominus & Siculorum Comes, Regni Hungariae Pro Libertate Confoederatorum Statuum necnon Munkacsiensis & Makoviczensis Dux, Perpetuus Comes de Saros; Dominus in Patak, Tokaj, Reg<U+00E9>cz, Ecsed, Somly<U+00F3>, Lednicze, Szerencs, Onod.''

His name is historically also spelled '''R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czy''', in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''II. R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi Ferenc'', in [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''Franti<U+0161>ek II. R<U+00E1>koci '', in [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: Franjo II. Rakoczy.

==Childhood==
[[Image:II.Rakoczi Ferenc es Zrinyi Ilona.jpg|thumb|200px|right| Statue of the young Francis II R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi with his mother Jelena Zrinska (in [[Mukachevo]]).]]

He was the richest landlord in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and was the count (''comes perpetuus'') of the ''Comitatus Sarossiensis'' (in Hungarian ''[[S<U+00E1>ros County|S<U+00E1>ros]]'') from 1694 on. He was the third of three children born to [[Francis I R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi]], elected ruling prince of [[Transylvania]], and [[Jelena Zrinska]] (''Zr<U+00ED>nyi Ilona'' in Hungarian), who was the daughter of [[Petar Zrinski]] (''Zr<U+00ED>nyi P<U+00E9>ter'' in Hungarian), [[List of rulers of Croatia|Ban]] of [[Croatia]], and niece of the poet [[Nikola VII Zrinski|Nikola Zrinski]] (''Zr<U+00ED>nyi Mikl<U+00F3>s'' in Hungarian). His [[George II R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi|grandfather]] and [[George I R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi|great-grandfather]], both called George, were Princes of [[Transylvania]]. He had a brother, George, who died as a baby before Francis was born, and a sister, [[Julianna R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi|Julianna]], who was four years older than Francis. His father died when Francis II was four months old.

Upon Francis I's death, his widow requested guardianship of her children; however, the advisors of [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] insisted that he retain guardianship of both Francis and his sister, especially as Francis I had willed this before death. Despite further difficulties, Jelena Zrinska was able to raise her children, while the Emperor retained legal guardianship. The family lived in the [[Palanok Castle|castle of Munk<U+00E1>cs]] (today ''Mukacheve'', in [[Ukraine]]), [[S<U+00E1>rospatak]] and [[Reg<U+00E9>c]] until 1680, when Francis<U+2019>s paternal grandmother, [[Sophia B<U+00E1>thory]], died. Then, they moved permanently into the castle of Munk<U+00E1>cs. R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi retained strong affection for this place throughout his life. Aside from his mother, R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi's key educators were [[Gy<U+00F6>rgy K<U+0151>r<U+00F6>ssy]], [[castellan]] to the family, and J<U+00E1>nos Badinyi.

==End of the Th<U+00F6>k<U+00F6>ly Uprising==

Jelena Zrinska<U+2019>s second husband, [[Imre Th<U+00F6>k<U+00F6>ly]] took little interest in R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi's education, as he was by then heavily involved in politics. However, the failure of the Turks to capture the Habsburg capital in the [[Battle of Vienna]] in 1683 frustrated Th<U+00F6>k<U+00F6>ly's plans to become King of [[Upper Hungary]]. When the Turks began to grow suspicious of his intentions, Th<U+00F6>k<U+00F6>ly proposed sending the young R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi to [[Constantinople]] as a guarantee of his goodwill. But R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi<U+2019>s mother opposed this plan, not wishing to be separated from her son.

In 1686 [[Antonio Caraffa]] besieged their residence, the castle of Munk<U+00E1>cs. Jelena Zrinska successfully led the defence of the castle for three years, but capitulated in 1688. The two R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi children fell again under the guardianship of [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], and moved to [[Vienna]] with their mother. They regained their possessions, but could not leave the city without the Emperor's permission.

At the age of 17, the Emperor emancipated R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi from his mother, thereby allowing him to own property. His sister Julianna had interceded for him after marrying a powerful Austrian, General Aspremont. R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi lived with the Aspremonts until his marriage in September 1694, to 15-year-old Princess Amelia, daughter of the Landgrave of [[Hesse-Wanfried]] and a descendant of Saint [[Elizabeth of Hungary]]. The couple moved to the [[R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi]] castle at S<U+00E1>rospatak, where R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi began to manage his properties.

The [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] on 26 January 1699, forced [[Imre Th<U+00F6>k<U+00F6>ly|Th<U+00F6>k<U+00F6>ly]] and Jelena Zrinska into exile. R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi remained in [[Vienna]] under the Emperor<U+2019>s supervision. Relying on the prevalent anti-Habsburg sentiment, remnants of Th<U+00F6>k<U+00F6>ly<U+2019>s peasant army started a new uprising in the [[Tokaj-Hegyalja|Hegyalja]] region of Northeastern present-day Hungary, which was part of the property of the R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi family. They captured the castles of [[Tokaj]], [[S<U+00E1>rospatak]] and [[S<U+00E1>toralja<U+00FA>jhely]], and asked R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi to become their leader, but he was not eager to head what appeared to be a minor peasant rebellion. He quickly returned to Vienna, where he tried his best to clear his name.
[[File:R<U+00E1>koci.jpg|thumb|250px|The memorial plate of Francis II R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi bricked into the northern wall of the [[St. Elisabeth Cathedral]] in [[Ko<U+0161>ice]], [[Slovakia]].]]
R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi then befriended [[Mikl<U+00F3>s Bercs<U+00E9>nyi|Count Mikl<U+00F3>s Bercs<U+00E9>nyi]], whose property at [[Ungv<U+00E1>r]] (today ''<U+0423><U+0436><U+0433><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+0434> (Uzhhorod)'', in [[Ukraine]]), lay next to his own. Bercs<U+00E9>nyi was a highly educated man, the third richest man in the kingdom (after R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi and [[Simon Forg<U+00E1>ch]]), and was related to most of the Hungarian aristocracy.

== The R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi Uprising ==<!-- This section is linked from [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]] -->

{{Main|R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi's War for Independence}}
As the [[Habsburg|House of Habsburg]] was on the verge of dying out in Spain, [[France]] was looking for allies in its fight against Austrian hegemony. Consequently, they established contact with R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi and promised support if he took up the cause of Hungarian independence. An Austrian spy seized this correspondence and brought it to the attention of the Emperor. As a direct result of this, R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi was arrested on 18 April 1700, and imprisoned in the fortress of [[Wiener Neustadt]] (south of Vienna). It became obvious during the preliminary hearings that, just as in the case of his grandfather [[Petar Zrinski]], the only possible sentence for Francis was death. With the aid of his pregnant wife Amelia and the prison commander, R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi managed to escape and flee to [[Poland]]. Here he met with Bercs<U+00E9>nyi again, and together they resumed contact with the French court.
Three years later, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] caused a large part of the Austrian forces in the Kingdom of Hungary to temporarily leave the country. Taking advantage of the situation, [[Kurucs|Kuruc]] forces began a new uprising in Munk<U+00E1>cs, and R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi was asked to head it. He decided to invest his energies in a war of national liberation, and accepted the request. On 15 June 1703, another group of about 3000 armed men headed by [[Tam<U+00E1>s Esze]] joined him near the Polish city of Lawoczne. Bercs<U+00E9>nyi also arrived, with French funds and 600 Polish mercenaries.
[[File:Benczur-rakoczi.jpg|thumb|[[Gyula Bencz<U+00FA>r]] (1844<U+2013>1920): Capture of Francis II. R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi in Nagys<U+00E1>ros Castle (1869)]]
Most of the Hungarian nobility did not support R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi<U+2019>s uprising, because they considered it to be no more than a [[jacquerie]], a peasant rebellion. R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi<U+2019>s famous call to the nobility of [[Szabolcs (county)|Szabolcs county]] seemed to be in vain. He did manage to convince the [[Hajduk (Hungarian soldiers)|Hajd<U+00FA>s]] (emancipated peasant warriors) to join his forces, so his forces controlled most of [[Kingdom of Hungary]] to the east and north of the [[Danube]] by late September 1703. He continued by conquering [[Transdanubia]] soon after.
Since the Austrians had to fight R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi on several fronts, they felt obliged to enter negotiations with him. However, the victory of Austrian and British forces against a combined French-Bavarian army in the [[Battle of Blenheim]] on 13 August 1704, provided an advantage not only in the War of the Spanish Succession, but also prevented the union of R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi<U+2019>s forces with their French-Bavarian allies.

This placed R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi into a difficult military and financial situation. French support gradually diminished, and a larger army was needed to occupy the already-won land. Meanwhile, supplying the current army with arms and food was beyond his means.  He tried to solve this problem by creating a new copper-based coinage, which was not easily accepted in Hungary as people were used to silver coins.  Nevertheless, R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi managed to maintain his military advantage for a while <U+2013> but after 1706, his army was forced into retreat.

A meeting of the Hungarian [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] (consisting of 6 bishops, 36 aristocrats and about 1000 representatives of the lower nobility of 25 counties), held near [[Sz<U+00E9>cs<U+00E9>ny]] ([[N<U+00F3>gr<U+00E1>d (county)|N<U+00F3>gr<U+00E1>d county]]) in September 1705, elected R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi to be the "vez<U+00E9>rl<U+0151> fejedelem" - (ruling) [[prince]] - of the Confederated Estates of the Kingdom of Hungary, to be assisted by a 24-member [[Senate]]. R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi and the Senate were assigned joint responsibility for the conduct of foreign affairs, including peace talks.
[[File:R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi szobor.jpg|thumb|250px|Statue in [[Budapest]], Hungary]]
Encouraged by [[England]] and the [[Netherlands]], peace talks started again on 27 October 1705 between the Hungarians and the Emperor. Both sides varied their strategy according to the military situation. One stumbling block was the sovereignty over [[Transylvania]] <U+2013> neither side was prepared to give it up. R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi<U+2019>s proposed treaty with the French was stalled, so he became convinced that only a declaration of independence would make it acceptable for various powers to negotiate with him. In 1706, his wife (whom he had not seen in 5 years, along with their sons J<U+00F3>zsef and Gy<U+00F6>rgy) and his sister were both sent as peace ambassadors, but R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi rejected their efforts on behalf of the Emperor.

In 1707 during the [[Great Northern War]] he was one of the candidates to the throne of [[Poland]], supported by [[El<U+017C>bieta Sieniawska]].

On R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi<U+2019>s recommendation, and with Bercs<U+00E9>nyi<U+2019>s support, another meeting of the Diet held at <U+00D3>nod ([[Borsod]] county) declared the deposition of the [[Habsburg|House of Habsburg]] from the Hungarian throne on 13 June 1707. But neither this act, nor the copper currency issued to avoid monetary inflation, were successful. [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] refused to enter into treaties with Prince R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi, leaving the Hungarians without allies. There remained the possibility of an alliance with [[Imperial Russia]], but this did not materialize either.

At the [[Battle of Tren<U+010D><U+00ED>n]] (Hungarian ''Trencs<U+00E9>n'', German ''Trentschin'', Latin ''Trentsinium'', [[Tren<U+010D><U+00ED>n county|Comitatus Trentsiniensis]], today in [[Slovakia]]), on 3 August 1708 R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi<U+2019>s horse stumbled, and he fell to the ground, which knocked him unconscious. The [[Kurucs|Kuruc]] forces thought him dead and fled. This defeat was fatal for the uprising. Numerous Kuruc leaders transferred their allegiance to the Emperor, hoping for clemency. R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi<U+2019>s forces became restricted to the area around Munk<U+00E1>cs and [[Szabolcs (county)|Szabolcs county]]. Not trusting the word of J<U+00E1>nos P<U+00E1>lffy, who was the Emperor<U+2019>s envoy charged with negotiations with the rebels, the Prince left the Kingdom of Hungary for [[Poland]] on 21 February 1711.

==The Peace Agreement==

In R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi<U+2019>s absence, [[S<U+00E1>ndor K<U+00E1>rolyi]] was named Commander-in-Chief of the Hungarian forces, and quickly negotiated a peace agreement with [[Johann Bernhard Stephan, Graf P<U+00E1>lffy ab Erd<U+00F6>d|J<U+00E1>nos P<U+00E1>lffy]]. Under its provisions, 12,000 rebels laid down their arms, handed over their flags and took an oath of allegiance to the Emperor on 1 May 1711 in the fields outside [[Majt<U+00E9>ny]], in [[Szatm<U+00E1>r]] county.

The [[Peace of Szatm<U+00E1>r]] did not treat R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi particularly badly. He was assured clemency if he took an oath of allegiance to the Emperor, as well as freedom to move to Poland if he wanted to leave the Kingdom of Hungary. He did not accept these conditions, doubting the honesty of the Habsburg court, and he did not even recognize the legality of the Peace Treaty, as it had been signed after the death of the Emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] on 17 April 1711, which terminated the plenipotential authority of J<U+00E1>nos P<U+00E1>lffy.

==Exile==

R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi was offered the Polish Crown twice, supported by Tsar [[Peter I of Russia]]. He turned the offers down, though, and remained in Poland until 1712, where he was the honoured guest of the Polish aristocracy. For a while he lived in [[Gda<U+0144>sk|Danzig]] (now [[Gda<U+0144>sk]], in [[Poland]]) under the pseudonym of ''Count of S<U+00E1>ros''.

He left Danzig on 16 November 1712, and went to England, where [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], pressured by the Habsburgs, refused to receive him. R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi then crossed the Channel to [[France]], landing in [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]] on 13 January 1713. On 27 April he handed a memorandum to [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] reminding him of his past services to France and asking him not to forget Hungary during the coming peace negotiations for the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. But neither the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 nor the [[Treaty of Rastatt]] in 1714 made any mention of Hungary or R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi. No provisions were even made to allow R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi<U+2019>s two sons, who were kept under surveillance in Vienna, to rejoin their father.

Prince R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi, although not recognized officially by France, was much in favour in the French court. But after the death of  [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] on 1 September 1715, he decided to accept the invitation of [[Turkey|the Ottoman Empire]] (still at war with the Habsburgs) to move there. He left France in September 1717, with an entourage of 40 people. and landed at [[Gallipoli]] on 10 October 1717. He was received with honours, but his desire to head up a separate Christian army to help in the fight against the Habsburgs was not under serious consideration.

The [[Ottoman Empire]] signed the Peace [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] with Austria on 21 July 1718.  Among its provisions was the refusal of the Turks to extradite the exiled Hungarians. Two years later, the Austrian envoy requested that the exiles be turned over, but the [[Sultan]] refused as a matter of honour. R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi and his entourage were settled in the town of [[Tekirda<U+011F>]] (Rodost<U+00F3> in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]), relatively distant from the [[Istanbul|Ottoman capital]], and a large Hungarian colony grew up around this town on the [[Sea of Marmara]]. Bercs<U+00E9>nyi, Count Simon Forg<U+00E1>ch, Count Antal Esterh<U+00E1>zy, Count Mih<U+00E1>ly Cs<U+00E1>ky, Mikl<U+00F3>s Sibrik, Zsigmond Zay, the two P<U+00E1>pays, and Colonel <U+00C1>d<U+00E1>m J<U+00E1>vorka were among many who settled there, sharing the sentiment of the writer [[Kelemen Mikes]], who said, <U+201C>I had no special reason to leave my country, except that I greatly loved the Prince.<U+201D>
[[File:Rodo<U+0161>to.jpg|thumb|250px|The memorial house of Francis II R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi in [[Ko<U+0161>ice]] (the replica of his house in the Turkish exile in [[Tekirda<U+011F>|Rodost<U+00F3>]])]]

R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi lived in the Turkish town of [[Tekirda<U+011F>]] for 18 years. He adopted a set routine: rising early, attending daily Mass, writing and reading in the mornings, and carpentry in the afternoons; visited occasionally by his son, Gy<U+00F6>rgy R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi. Further military troubles in 1733 in Poland awakened his hopes of a possible return to Hungary, but they were not fulfilled. R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi was 59 years old when he died on 8 April 1735.

R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi<U+2019>s testament, dated 27 October 1732, left something to all his family members as well as to his fellow exiles. He left separate letters to be sent to the Sultan and to [[France]]<U+2019>s Ambassador to Constantinople, asking them not to forget about his fellow exiles. His internal organs were buried in the Greek church of [[Rodosto]], while his heart was sent to France. After obtaining the permission of the Turkish authorities, R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi<U+2019>s body was taken by his faithful chamberlain Kelemen Mikes to [[Constantinople]] on 6 July 1735 for burial in Saint-Beno<U+00EE>t (then Jesuit) French church in Galata, where he was buried, according to his last wishes, next to his mother [[Jelena Zrinska]].

His remains were moved on 29 October 1906 to the [[St. Elisabeth Cathedral]] in [[Ko<U+0161>ice|Kassa]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] (today Ko<U+0161>ice, [[Slovakia]]), where he is buried with his mother Jelena and his son.<ref>Katalin M<U+00E1>ria Kincses <U+201E>Without Special Ceremony: The Cult of R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi - Bringing Home the Prince's Mortal Remains<U+201D>  [http://epa.oszk.hu/00000/00018/00023/10.htm]</ref>

==Memory==
R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi has become a Hungarian national hero whose memory still lives on. Most Hungarians associate his last name with him alone, not other members of the same family.

===Memorials===

His equestrian statue with the famous motto "Cum Deo Pro Patria et Libertate" written on its red marble base was erected in front of the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]] on [[Lajos Kossuth Square]] in 1937. The memorial is the work of [[J<U+00E1>nos P<U+00E1>sztor]]. In the 1950s the first two words ("Cum Deo" i.e. ''With the Help of God'') were deleted because of ideological reasons but they were rewritten in 1989.

When the great '''Millennium Monument''' on [[Heroes' Square (Budapest)|Heroes' Square]] was purged from the statues of the [[Habsburg]] kings of Hungary after 1945 the best sculptor of the period, [[Zsigmond Kisfaludi Strobl]] made a new statue of R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi instead of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|King Lip<U+00F3>t II]]. It was erected in 1953 together with a relief on the base depicting the meeting of R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czy and [[Tam<U+00E1>s Esze]].

===Places and institutions===
Many Hungarian cities have commemorated R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi by naming streets and squares after him.
One of the most prominent roads in [[Budapest]] is '''R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi <U+00FA>t''' ("R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi road"), forming the boundary between Districts VII and VIII. The street was named after him on 28 October 1906 when his remains were brought back to Hungary from [[Turkey]] and a long funeral march went along the street to the [[Eastern Railway Station (Budapest)|Eastern Railway Station]]. '''R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi t<U+00E9>r''' ("R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi square"), in District VIII, was also named after him in 1874.

In Hungary two villages bear the name of R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi. [[R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czifalva]] in [[J<U+00E1>sz-Nagykun-Szolnok]] County was established in 1883 on the former estate of R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi were the Prince had a hunting lodge. The neighbouring [[R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi<U+00FA>jfalu]] became an independent village in 1950 (before that it was part of R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czifalva).

The village of [[Zavadka]], today in [[Ukraine]] next to the [[Veretski Pass]] (Hungarian: ''Vereckei-h<U+00E1>g<U+00F3>'') where R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi arrived at Hungary in the beginning of the uprising in 1703 and where he said goodbye to his followers in 1711 going into exile was renamed '''R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czisz<U+00E1>ll<U+00E1>s''' in 1889. The neighbouring village of Podpol<U+00F3>c (today [[Pidpolozzya]]) where R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi spent a night in 1703 was renamed that year '''Vez<U+00E9>rsz<U+00E1>ll<U+00E1>s'''. After 1918 the two villages got back their former names.

The '''Mount Bovcar''' (today [[Vovcharskiy Vrh]] in present-day [[Ukraine]] and the neighbouring '''Bovcar Spring''' was named by the local [[Rusyns|Rusyn]] people after R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi who drank from the spring on 18 February 1711. Bovcar means "the Tsar was here" in [[Rusyn language]].

The library of [[Borsod-Aba<U+00FA>j-Zempl<U+00E9>n]] county in [[Miskolc]] (II. R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi Ferenc Megyei K<U+00F6>nyvt<U+00E1>r) has also been named after him.

The house which he lived in Tekirda<U+011F> is a museum now, open to the visitors everyday.

===Banknotes===
[[File:HUF 500 1998 obverse.jpg|thumb|left|200px|R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi on the 500 [[Hungarian forint|Ft]] banknote]]
R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi<U+2019>s portrait can be found on Hungarian banknotes. Before it had been withdrawn from circulation, it was on the 50-forint note. Since then it has been transferred to the 500-[[Hungarian forint|forint]] note.

===The R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi March===
A well-known patriotic tune of the 18-19th century (composer unknown), is also named after R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi, as it was reputed to be his favourite, although actually it was composed only in the 1730s. [[Hector Berlioz]] orchestrated the piece, and it was also used by [[Franz Liszt]] as the basis of his [[Hungarian Rhapsodies|Hungarian Rhapsody No.15]]. The R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czy March remains a popular piece of Hungarian state and military celebrations.
