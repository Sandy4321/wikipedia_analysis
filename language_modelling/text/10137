'''William Maxwell Evarts''' (February 6, 1818 &ndash; February 28, 1901) was an [[United States|American]] lawyer and statesman who served as [[U.S. Secretary of State]], [[U.S. Attorney General]] and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[New York]]. He was born in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], the son of author, editor, and [[Indian removal]] opponent [[Jeremiah Evarts]], and the grandson of [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]] signer [[Roger Sherman]].

==School, family, and early career==
William attended [[Boston Latin School]], graduated from [[Yale College]] in 1837 and then attended [[Harvard Law School]]. While at Yale he became a member of the secret society [[Skull and Bones]], but later in life spoke out against such societies at the 1873 Yale commencement alumni meeting, claiming they bred snobbishness.<ref>{{Cite book |authorlink=Alexandra Robbins |first=Alexandra |last=Robbins |title=Secrets of the Tomb: Skull and Bones, the Ivy League, and the Hidden Paths of Power |location=Boston |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |year=2002 |pages=131, 199 |isbn=0316720917 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |first=Chester Leonard |last=Barrows |title=William M. Evarts, Lawyer, Diplomat, Statesman |location= |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=1941 |page=12 }}</ref>

He was admitted to the bar in [[New York]] in 1841, and soon took high rank in his profession.  He married Helen Minerva Bingham Wardner in 1843.  They had 12 children between 1845 and 1862, all born in New York City.

==Early political career==
A [[United States Whig Party|Whig Party]] supporter before joining the fledgling [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], Evarts was appointed an assistant United States district attorney and served from 1849-1853.  In 1860 he was chairman of the New York delegation to the [[Republican National Convention]] where he placed Senator [[William H. Seward]]'s name in nomination for President. He served on New York's Union Defense Committee during the Civil War. In 1861 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the [[United States Senate]] from New York.  He was a member of the State constitutional convention in 1867-1868.

==Service in the Andrew Johnson administration==
He was chief counsel for [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] during the [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] trial, and from July 1868 until March 1869 he was Johnson's Attorney General.

==Service in the Grant administration== 
In 1872 he was counsel for the [[United States]] before the tribunal of [[arbitration]] on the [[Alabama Claims|Alabama claims]] at [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. Evarts was also a founding member of the [[New York City Bar Association]], and served as its first president from 1870 to 1879, by far the longest tenure of any president since.

==Service in the Hayes administration==
Evarts served as counsel for President-elect [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], on behalf of the Republican Party, before the [[Electoral Commission (US)|Electoral Commission]] in the disputed [[U.S. presidential election, 1876|presidential election of 1876]].  During President Hayes's administration he was Secretary of State.  He was a delegate to the [[International Monetary Conferences|International Monetary Conference]] at Paris 1881.

==U.S. Senator==
From 1885 to 1891 he was a U.S. Senator from New York. While in Congress ([[Forty-ninth United States Congress|49th]], [[Fiftieth United States Congress|50th]] and [[Fifty-first United States Congress|51st]] Congresses), he served as chairman of the [[U.S. Congress Joint Committee on the Library|U.S. Senate Committee on the Library]] from 1887 to 1891. He was also a sponsor of the [[Judiciary Act of 1891]] also known as the Evarts Act, which created the [[United States courts of appeals]].<ref>{{Cite book |first=Yasmin Sabin |last=Khan |title=Enlightening the World: The Creation of the Statue of Liberty |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |year=2010 |page=135 |isbn=9780801448515 }}</ref> As an orator Senator Evarts stood in the foremost rank, and some of his best speeches were published.

==Chair of the American Committee for the Statue of Liberty==
He led the American fund-raising effort for the pedestal for the [[Statue of Liberty]], serving as the chairman of the American Committee.  He spoke at its unveiling on October 28, 1886.  His speech was entitled "The United Work of the Two Republics."  "Taking a breath in the middle of his address, he was understood to have completed his speech.  The signal was given, and Bartholdi, together with Richard Butler and David H. King Jr., whose firm built the pedestal and erected the statue, let the veil fall from her face.  A 'huge shock of sound' erupted as a thunderous cacophony of salutes from steamer whistles, brass bands, and booming guns, together with clouds of smoke from the cannonade, engulfed the statue for the next half hour."<ref>Khan (2010), p. 179.</ref>

==Retirement==
Senator Evarts retired from public life due to ill health in 1891.  He was also part of a law practice in New York City called Evarts, Southmoyd and Choate.

He owned a large number of properties in [[Windsor, Vermont]] including Evarts Pond and a group of historic homes often referred to as Evarts Estate.  The homes included 26 Main St. in Windsor, Vermont. The home was purchased from John Skinner in the 1820s for $5,000 by William M. Evarts and was passed down to his daughter, Elizabeth Hoar Evarts Perkins, who left the home to family members,  including her son [[Maxwell Perkins]]. The home stayed in the family until 2005. 26 Main Street in Windsor, Vermont was recently restored and reopened as Snapdragon Inn.  Snapdragon Inn is open to the public and features a library that displays and collects items related to the history of William M. Evarts and his extended family.

He died in [[New York City]] and was buried at Ascutney Cemetery in [[Windsor, Vermont]].

==Extended family==
William was a descendant of the English emigrant John Evarts, who settled in Northwestern [[Connecticut]] in the 17th century.

William was a member of the extended [[Baldwin, Hoar & Sherman family]], which had many members in American politics.

[[Ebenezer R. Hoar]], a first cousin of Evarts, was a [[U.S. Attorney General]], Associate Justice of the [[Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts]] and representative in [[U.S. House of Representatives|Congress]]. The two  were best friends, and shared  similar professional pursuits and political beliefs. Each served, in succession, as United States Attorney General. Some of Evarts's other first cousins include U.S. Senator & Governor of the State of [[Connecticut]], [[Roger Sherman Baldwin]]; U.S. Senator for Massachusetts  (brother of Ebenezer R.) [[George F. Hoar]]; and [[California]] state senator and founding trustee of the [[University of California]], [[Sherman Day]].

Son [[Maxwell Evarts]] graduated from [[Yale University|Yale College]] in 1884, where he was also a member of [[Skull and Bones]]. He served as a New York City District attorney, and then later as General Counsel for [[E. H. Harriman]], which later became the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], president of two (2) Windsor, VT banks, and the chief financial backer of the Gridley Automatic Lathe ''(manufactured by the Windsor Machine Co.)''.  In politics, Maxwell served as a representative in the Vermont state legislature and was a Vermont State Fair Commissioner.

Allen Wardner Evarts, another son, graduated from [[Yale College]] in 1869. He supported the founding of [[Wolf's Head (secret society)|Wolf's Head Society]], and was first president of its alumni association and held the position for 20 years over two separate terms. He was a law partner, corporate president, and [[trustee]] of [[Vassar College]].

Grandson [[Maxwell Perkins|Maxwell E. Perkins]] was the famed Charles Scribner's Sons editor of  [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Thomas Wolfe]], [[Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings]] and [[James Jones (author)|James Jones]].

Great nephew [[Evarts Boutell Greene]] was the famed American historian appointed [[Columbia University]]'s first [[De Witt Clinton]] Professor of History 1923, Department Chairman from 1926 to 1939. Chairman of the Columbia Institute of Japanese Studies, 1936<U+2013>39.  He was a noted authority on the American Colonial and [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] periods. Another relative, Henry Sherman Boutell, was a member of the [[Illinois]] state house of representatives, 1884; member of the U.S. Representative from Illinois from 1897 to 1911 (6th District 1897-1903, 9th District 1903-11); delegate, [[Republican National Convention]] from Illinois, 1908; U.S. Minister, [[Switzerland]], 1911-13.

Great great nephew [[Roger Sherman Greene II]], the son of Daniel Crosby Greene and Mary Jane (Forbes) Greene; was the U.S. Vice Consul in [[Rio de Janeiro]], 1903<U+2013>04; [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], 1904<U+2013>05; [[Kobe]], 1905; U.S. Consul in [[Vladivostok]], 1907; [[Harbin]], 1909<U+2013>11; U.S. Consul General in [[Hankou District|Hankow]], 1911-14.

Great great nephew [[Jerome Davis Greene]] (1874<U+2013>1959): President, Lee, Higginson & Company from 1917 to 1932; Secretary, [[Harvard University]] Corporation from 1905 to 1910 & 1934-1943; General Manager of the [[Rockefeller Institute]] 1910-1012, assistant and secretary to [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] as Trustee, Rockefeller Institute; Trustee, [[Rockefeller Foundation]]; Trustee, Rockefeller General Education Board from 1910 to 1939. executive secretary, American Section - Allied Maritime Transport Council, 1918 Joint Secretary of the Reparations, [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], 1919; Chairman, American Council Institute of Pacific Relations, 1929<U+2013>32; Trustee, [[Brookings Institution]] of Washington from 1928 to 1945; and a founding member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].

Great-grandson [[Archibald Cox]] served as a U.S. Solicitor General and special prosecutor during President [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Watergate Scandal]], whereas Evarts defended a U.S. President [[Andrew Johnson]] in his impeachment trial. In a sense, they both successfully argued their cases, which represent two of the three U.S. Presidential impeachment efforts.  An impeachment trial was never held in Nixon's case, due to the president's resignation.
