'''Alabama''' is an [[United States|American]] [[country music|country]], [[southern rock]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] band formed in [[Fort Payne, Alabama|Fort Payne]], [[Alabama]] in 1969. The band was founded by [[Randy Owen]] ([[lead vocals]], [[rhythm guitar]]) and his cousin [[Teddy Gentry]] ([[bass guitar]], [[background vocals]]), soon joined by their other cousin, [[Jeff Cook]] ([[lead guitar]], [[fiddle]], [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]]). First operating under the name Wildcountry, the group toured the [[Southeast United States|Southeast]] bar circuit in the early 1970s, and began writing original songs. They changed their name to Alabama in 1977 and following the chart success of two singles, were approached by [[RCA Nashville]] for a record deal.

Alabama's biggest success came in the 1980s, where the band had over 27 number one hits, seven multi-platinum albums and received numerous awards. Alabama's first single on RCA Nashville, "[[Tennessee River (song)|Tennessee River]]", began a streak of number one singles, including "[[Love in the First Degree (Alabama song)|Love in the First Degree]]" (1981), "[[Mountain Music (song)|Mountain Music]]" (1982), "[[Dixieland Delight]]" (1983), "[[If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)]]" (1984) and "[[Song of the South (song)|Song of the South]]" (1987). The group's popularity waned slightly in the 1990s, although they continued to receive hit singles and multi-platinum record sales. Alabama disbanded in 2006 following a farewell tour and two albums of inspirational music, but reunited in 2011 and have continued to record and tour worldwide.

The band's blend of traditional country music and [[southern rock]] combined with elements of [[gospel music]], and [[pop music]] gave it a [[crossover (music)|crossover]] appeal that helped lead to their success.  They also [[concert|toured]] extensively and incorporated production elements such as lighting and "sets" inspired by [[rock concert]]s into their shows.  The band has over 30 number one country records on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts to their credit and have sold over 75 million records, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling bands of all time]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/10/post_272.html|title=Teddy Gentry of the group Alabama will sing his songs and tell stories behind them at Samford University|publisher=[[The Birmingham News]]|date=October 3, 2014|first=Cary|last=Estes|accessdate=December 17, 2014}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] credited the band with popularizing the idea of a country band, and wrote that "it's unlikely that any other country group will be able to surpass the success of Alabama."{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=6}}

==History==

===Formation and early years: 1969<U+2013>79===
[[Image:FortPayneAir.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Alabama formed in [[Fort Payne, Alabama|Fort Payne]], [[Alabama]], seen here in 1999.]]
Alabama was formed by guitarists [[Randy Owen]] and [[Jeff Cook]], and bassist [[Teddy Gentry]], three cousins born and raised near [[Fort Payne, Alabama|Fort Payne]], [[Alabama]], an area with strong country music roots.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} Owen and Gentry grew up on separate [[cotton]] farms on [[Lookout Mountain]] (on the opposite corner of north Alabama), learning guitar together and singing in church before the age of six.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} Gentry and Owen played in numerous groups during the 1960s, ranging from [[pop music|pop]] to [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]].{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} Cook joined the band in 1969, forming the group Young Country, which first jammed together around Christmas.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} Cook also played in numerous bands and was a [[rock and roll]] [[disk jockey]].{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} The three cousins all shared vocal duties, with another cousin, drummer Jackie Owen, completing the group's first lineup.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} The band's first performance was at a high school talent contest (playing a [[Merle Haggard]] song), for which they won first prize and tickets to the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref name="usatoday"/>{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} Despite this, all were busy with prior commitments to pursue music: Owen still in high school, Cook working for [[Western Electric]], and Gentry laying carpets full-time.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} The band grew further inactive when Cook went to college and Owen into the military.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}}

The group became a professional band in 1972, adding drummer Bennett Vartanian and changing their name to Wildcountry.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} During this time, the group accepted a position playing at the nearby Canyonland theme park.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=5}}{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} The park would bring in established stars, such as [[Jerry Wallace]], [[Bobby Bare]], and [[Narvel Felts]], and the band would back them, afterwards performing a one-hour dance set.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} After a while, with opportunities for the band slim, a discouraged Cook took a government job in [[Anniston, Alabama]]. Owen was studying English at [[Jacksonville State University]], and Cook had an electronics job.<ref name=billboard>{{cite journal| last =Flippo| first =Chip| date =August 29, 1998| title =Alabama: The ''Billboard'' Interview| journal =[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| volume =110| issue = 35| page = | publisher =[[Prometheus Global Media]]| location =[[New York City]]| issn =0006-2510| url = }}</ref> The trio shared at $56-a-month apartment in Anniston,<ref name="billboard"/> working to keep the band afloat with night and weekend gigs.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} The group decided to become professional musicians in 1973, and began performing at bars throughout the [[Southeast United States|Southeast]].{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} In March, the band relocated to [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]], [[South Carolina]], performing six nights a week at a club named The Bowery for tips.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=5}}<ref name="tenn"/> They made their best money performing [[cover (music)|cover]] songs of [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] and Merle Haggard.<ref name="usatoday"/> The group could not secure a record contract, and began to self-finance recordings.<ref name="billboard"/> The group borrowed $4,000 from a Fort Payne bank to record and release their own albums to sell at shows.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} Vartanian dropped out of the group, and following a rotation of four more drummers, they settled on Rick Scott in 1974.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}}

The group sent out demo tapes to record companies but received few responses until executives at [[GRT Records]] signed the band to a one-record contract,{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} issuing their debut single, "I Want to Be with You", in 1977.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} GRT was more interested in the band as songwriters, and convinced the group to change their name to the Alabama Band, later shortened to Alabama.<ref name="billboard1"/>{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=5}} The song did not chart, and GRT declared bankruptcy the following year. Due to a hidden clause in their contract, Alabama was forbidden from recording with another label.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} For the next two years, the band raised money to buy out their contract, and they began recording again in 1979.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} Following self-recorded efforts ''Wildcountry'' (1976) and ''Deuces Wild'' (1977), ''Alabama Band No. 3'' became the band's third album, and the band performed over 300 shows on the road that year.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} The group hired independent radio promoters to receive radio play for the single "[[I Wanna Come Over]]", and they sent hand-written letters to program directors and DJs nationwide.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} It received the attention of [[Dallas]]-based MDJ Records, who signed the band.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} Scott left the group at this time, and was replaced by [[Mark Herndon]], a rock drummer later credited with bringing the band their signature sound.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=4}} "I Wanna Come Over", became their first radio hit, reaching the top 40 in the ''Billboard'' country chart.<ref name="billboard3"/>

Owen was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] in 2010, but he was later given a clean bill of health, which led to the band's reunion, without Herndon.<ref name="tenn"/> Following [[April 25<U+2013>28, 2011 tornado outbreak|a series of tornados]] destroying homes and businesses throughout their state in 2011, Alabama assembled a benefit concert in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], called Bama Rising.<ref name="tenn"/> Featuring the band's first set since 2004, alongside [[Luke Bryan]], [[Sheryl Crow]] and [[Brad Paisley]], the concert raised $2.1 million.

==Musical style and influences==
Alabama's music mixes both country, rock, and pop, particularly evident in their musical concept: the group were one of the first country bands to achieve significant airplay.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=3}} Despite their influences from other genres, the band were most inspired by country music, which are most evident in their "harmonies, songwriting, and approach."{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=3}} Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes that the band are "indebted to country, particularly the [[Bakersfield sound]] of [[Merle Haggard]], bluegrass, and the sound of [[country pop|Nashville pop]]."{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=3}} The band echoed their country upbringing in one of their first trade articles: "We're country first and crossover second. If crossovers come, that's great, but we'd rather have a No. 1. country song than be lost in the middle of both country and pop charts," said Owen.<ref name=billboard2>{{cite journal| last =Wells| first =Robyn| date =December 13, 1980| title =Alabama Makes Its Mark| journal =[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| volume =92| issue = 50| page = | publisher =[[Prometheus Global Media]]| location =[[New York City]]| issn =0006-2510| url = }}</ref>

By the mid-1980s, the band increasingly moved toward a general [[pop-rock]] sound, "going for splashier productions with a more heavily amplified sound."<ref name=BiographicalDictionary>Carlin, Richard. (2002). ''Country Music: A Biographical Dictionary''. [[London]]: [[Routledge]], 540 pp. First edition, 2002.</ref> Alabama's lyrics often centered around their homeland. Their first hit single, "Tennessee River", recounts being "born across the river in the mountains I call home," while "Dixieland Delight" chronicles cruising down a rural Tennessee [[Byway (road)|byway]].<ref name="tenn"/>

==Chart records, sales, and awards==

===Multiplatinum certifications===
Alabama is among the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling bands of all time]], having sold a combined 75 million albums and singles.<ref name="Kazek">{{cite news|url=http://www.al.com/living/index.ssf/2014/01/10_weird_and_wonderful_roadsid.html|title=10 weird and wonderful roadside memorials to musicians in Alabama (Odd Travels with photos)|publisher=[[The Birmingham News]]|date=2014-01-22|first=Kelly|last=Kazek|accessdate=2014-05-10}}</ref> Alabama's best-selling [[studio album]] is ''[[Mountain Music (album)|Mountain Music]]'' (1982), while two greatest hits albums <U+2014> ''[[Greatest Hits]]'' (1986) and ''[[For the Record]]'' (1998) <U+2014> are among their highest in individual sales, with all three totaling five million in sales.<ref name="alabamaRIAA"/> Alabama received multiplatinum success for several albums; albums currently certified quadruple platinum include ''[[Feels So Right]]'', ''[[The Closer You Get...]]'', and ''[[Roll On (Alabama album)|Roll On]]'', while Alabama's double platinum records include ''[[My Home's in Alabama]]'', ''[[40-Hour Week]]'', ''[[Alabama Christmas]]'' and ''[[Greatest Hits Vol. III (Alabama album)|Greatest Hits Volume III]]''.<ref name="alabamaRIAA"/>

===Awards===
{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by Alabama}}
Alabama are the most awarded band in the history of country music, with over 200 awards from a variety of organizations.<ref name="billboard1"/> In 1981, Alabama won both the Vocal Group of the Year and Instrumental Group of the Year honors from the CMAs. It also won the ACM's Vocal Group of the Year award, and ''Billboard''{{'s}} New Group of the Year honors. The group won the CMA's prestigious Entertainer of the Year award for three consecutive years (1982<U+2013>84), and the ACM's Entertainer of the Year award five times (1982<U+2013>86).<ref name="billboard1"/> In 1989, Alabama was named Artist of the Decade by the ACM. In addition, Alabama has also received the [[Music Business Association|NARM Gift of Music]] award, the [[Alabama Hall of Fame]] Distinguished Service award, the Country Radio Broadcasters Humanitarian Award, the [[Prince Matchabelli]] National Hero Award, the [[Bob Hope Humanitarian Award]], and a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref name="billboard1"/>

==Legacy==

===Impact===
Alabama has been credited with "substantially broadening country's audience while becoming one of the most popular acts in American musical history" by Michael McCall of ''The Encyclopedia of Country Music''.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=5}} The band was notable for its three-person lead (as "most other country acts focused on a soloist accompanied by an anonymous band"), their collective hair length and facial hair (which would have been deemed unacceptable just a decade earlier), and their prominent electric bass and drums.<ref name="BiographicalDictionary"/> They had a slightly edgier sound than other groups, and both played their own instruments and wrote their own songs.<ref name="tenn"/> Alabama mostly appealed to a younger audience, although their clean-cut image appealed to the more [[conservative]], older country audience as well.<ref name="BiographicalDictionary"/> Kurt Wolff described the band's appeal: "They're just rebel enough for the young folks, but their parents also dig the boys' pretty harmonies, sentimental soft spots, and old-fashioned family values."<ref name=wolff>Wolff, Kurt. (2000). ''Country Music: The Rough Guide''. Rough Guides, 608 pp. First edition, 2000.</ref> Alabama gave prominence to their hometown of Fort Payne, and also raised awareness for environmental issues.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=6}}

The band's incorporation of rock and roll into their sound was an inspiration for groups such as [[Restless Heart]], [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]], [[Exile (American band)|Exile]], [[Diamond Rio]], [[Lonestar]], [[Ricochet (band)|Ricochet]], and [[the Mavericks]].{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=5}}<ref name="billboard1"/> According to Irwin Stambler and Grelun Landon, authors of ''Country Music: The Encyclopedia'', the group's diminishing sales in the late 1980s reflected competition from country bands that would not have received recognition had it not been for Alabama paving the way. For their part, these groups credited Alabama with providing a massive influence on their careers.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=6}} Prior to Alabama's unprecedented chart success, most country hit singles belonged to solo artists or duets.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} Many Alabama singles and albums represented crossover appeal on the pop charts.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=6}}

Despite their successes, Alabama's career was loathed by music critics of the day, citing the "vacuous songs and watered-down, middle-of-the-road arrangements" that blurred lines between country and pop.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=6}} ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' once argued the band "render[s] country music all but indistinguishable from pop" and thus "trivializes some of country's most hallowed traditions."{{sfn|Kingsbury|2004|p=8}} Indeed, reviewers such as Wolff consider the band's "overriding problem" their calculated sound, which leads many contemporary music critics to label the band mediocre.<ref name="wolff"/>

===Philanthropy===
Beginning in 1982 and continuing until 1997, Alabama sponsored the June Jam, a music festival in Fort Payne, which at its peak drew 60,000 fans and raised millions for local charities.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=6}} The group also held "Fan Appreciation Days," weekend events that included a golf tournament and a songwriters concert that raised money for charities in Fort Payne.<ref name="billboard1"/> Owen spearheaded "Country Cares for Kids," an annual country [[Telethon|radiothon]] that raised over $70 million for [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]].<ref name="billboard1"/>
