'''HMS ''Duc de la Vaguinon''''' (or ''Duc de la Vaugignon'') was the French privateer [[cutter (ship)|cutter]] ''Duc de la Vauguyon'', launched in 1779 and captured by the British later that same year. The British took her into the [[Royal Navy]], but she was lost later that year, giving her a total career of only about nine months.

==Origins==
''Duc de la Vauginon'' was probably built at Honfleur. She was launched on 20 March 1779. Her first captain was Nicolas Roger, in April. However, Commandant Marin Le Page replaced him.<ref>Demerliac (1796), p.182, #1784.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Demerliac also has an entry showing her as being from Dunkirk.:<ref>Demerliac (1796), p. 174, #1682.</ref>|group=Note}}

==Capture==
{{HMS|Medea|1778|2}}, Captain James Montague, and ''Countess of Scarborough'', Captain Thomas Piercy, shared in the capture, on 17 June 1779, of the French privateers ''Due de la Vauguyon'' and [[Comte de Maurepas (ship)|''Comte de Maurepas'']].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=12061|startpage=2|date=26 February 1780}}</ref> ''Medea'' captured ''Due de la Vauguyon'' (or ''Duc de Lavaugnon'') of Dunkirk, a [[cutter (ship)|cutter]] of 14 guns and 98 men, after a fight of an hour. The fight cost the French four men killed and ten wounded; ''Medea'' had no casualties. The British took her into service as ''Duc de la Vauginon''.}

''Duc de la Vauguyon'' had captured and ransomed a lobster [[Smack (ship)|smack]] sailing from Norway to Britain. The master of the smack informed Montague that the privateer had had a consort. ''Medea{{'}}''s rigging was too cut up for her to pursue the consort, so Montague sent Piercy after her. Piercy caught up with ''Compte de Maurepas'' after a few hours and the privateer struck without resistance.{{#tag:ref|Demerliac and English records give her name as ''Comtesse de Maurepas'', and her origin as Boulogne.<ref>Demerliac (1996), p.179, #1741.</ref> The letter reporting her capture gives her name as above, and her origin as Dunkirk.|group=Note}}

==Fate==
Between September and November 1779, ''Duc De La Vauginon'' underwent coppering and fitting at Deptford. She was commissioned in September under the command of Lieutenant Charles Jordan.<ref>Winfield (2007).</ref> He was still in command when she was went missing around 15 December 1779 during a storm in the North Sea.<ref>Hepper (1994), p.58.</ref>
