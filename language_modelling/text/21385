'''Jackson DeForest Kelley''' (January 20, 1920&nbsp;<U+2013> June 11, 1999) was an American actor known for his iconic roles in Westerns and as Dr. [[Leonard McCoy|Leonard "Bones" McCoy]] of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] in the television and film series ''[[Star Trek]]''.

==Early life==
Kelley was born in [[Toccoa, Georgia]], the son of Clora (n<U+00E9>e Casey) and Ernest David Kelley, who was a [[Baptist]] minister of Irish and Southern ancestry. DeForest was named after the pioneering [[electronics engineer]] [[Lee De Forest]], and later named his ''Star Trek'' character's father "David" after his own. Kelley was delivered in their home by his uncle, a prominent local physician.  Kelley had an older brother, Ernest Casey Kelley.<ref name=bio>{{cite book|last=Lee Rioux|first=Terry|title=From Sawdust to Stardust|year=2005|publisher=Rocket Books}}</ref> As a child, he often played outside for hours at a time. Kelley was immersed in his father's mission in Conyers and promised his father failure would mean "wreck and ruin". Before the end of his first year at Conyers, Kelley was introduced into the congregation to his musical talents and often sang solo in morning church services.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080609033023/http://www.pathcom.com/~boby/kelley.htm The Star Trek Explorer&nbsp;<U+2013> DeForest Kelley Obituary]</ref> Eventually, this led to an appearance on the radio station [[WSB (AM)|WSB AM]] in [[Atlanta]], Georgia. As a result of his radio work, he won an engagement with Lew Forbes and his orchestra at the Paramount Theater.<ref name=bio />

In 1934, the family left Conyers for the community of Decatur. He attended the Decatur Boys High School where he played with the Decatur Bantams baseball team. Kelley also played football and other sports. Before his graduation, Kelley got a job as a drugstore's car hop. He also spent his weekends working in the local theatres. Kelley graduated in 1938.<ref name=bio />

Kelley served in World War II as an enlisted man in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] between March 10, 1943, and January 28, 1946, assigned to the [[First Motion Picture Unit]]. After an extended stay in [[Long Beach, California]], Kelley decided to pursue an acting career and relocate to southern California permanently, living for a time with his uncle Casey. He worked as an usher in a local theater in order to earn enough money for the move. Kelley's mother encouraged her son in his new career goal, but his father disliked the idea. While in California, Kelley was spotted by a [[Paramount Pictures]] scout while doing a [[United States Navy]] training film.<ref name=bio />

==Career==
===Early roles===
Kelley performed on radio in ''The Flesh Peddler'' on August 4, 1957. His acting career began with the feature film ''[[Fear in the Night]]''. The low-budget movie was a hit, bringing him to the attention of a national audience and giving Kelley reason to believe that he would soon become a star. His next role, in ''[[Variety Girl]],'' established him as a leading actor and resulted in the founding of his first [[fan club]]. Kelley did not become a leading man, however, and he and his wife, Carolyn, decided to move to New York City. He found work on stage and on live television, but after three years in New York, the Kelleys returned to [[Hollywood]]. In California, he received a role in an installment of ''[[You Are There (series)|You Are There]],'' anchored by [[Walter Cronkite]]. He played ranch owner Bob Kitteridge in the 1949 episode "Legion of Old Timers" of the TV series ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]''. This led to an appearance in ''[[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (film)|Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]'' as [[Morgan Earp]]  (brother to [[Burt Lancaster]]'s [[Wyatt Earp]]). This role was a source for three movie offers, including ''[[Warlock (1959 film)|Warlock]]'' with [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Anthony Quinn]]. He also appeared in episodes of the TV series' ''[[Perry Mason]]'', ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'', ''[[Boots and Saddles (TV series)|Boots and Saddles]]'', ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater]]'', ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'', ''[[Bat Masterson (TV series)|Bat Masterson]]'', and many others. He appeared in the 1962 episode of ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'', "1800 Days to Justice", and "The Clover Throne" as Willis. He had a small role in the movie ''[[The View from Pompey's Head]]''.

For nine years, Kelley primarily played villains. He built up an impressive list of credits, alternating between television and motion pictures. However, he was afraid of [[typecasting (acting)|typecasting]], so he broke away from villains by starring in ''[[Where Love Has Gone (film)|Where Love Has Gone]]'' and a television pilot called ''333 Montgomery''. The pilot was written by an ex-policeman named [[Gene Roddenberry]], and a few years later Kelley would appear in another Roddenberry pilot, ''Police Story'' (1967), that was again not developed into a series.

===''Star Trek''===

In 1956, years before being cast as Dr. McCoy, Kelley played a small supporting role as a medic in ''[[The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit]]'' in which he utters the diagnosis "This man's dead, Captain" and "That man is dead" to Gregory Peck.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w_Ml9jiAQM Excerpt The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit]</ref> Kelley appeared as Lieutenant Commander James Dempsey in two episodes of the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] military drama, ''[[The Silent Service (TV series)|The Silent Service]]'', based on actual stories of the [[submarine]] section of the [[United States Navy]]. In 1962, he appeared in the ''[[Bonanza]]'' episode entitled "The Decision", as a doctor sentenced to hang for the murder of a journalist. The judge in this episode was portrayed by [[John Hoyt]], who later portrayed Dr. Phillip John Boyce, one of Leonard McCoy's predecessors, on the ''Star Trek'' pilot "[[The Cage (Star Trek)|The Cage]]". In 1963, he appeared in ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' episode " Man of Violence" as a "drinking" cavalry doctor with [[Leonard Nimoy]] as his patient (Nimoy's character did not survive). Just before ''Star Trek'' began filming, Kelley appeared as a doctor again, in the ''[[Laredo (TV series)|Laredo]]'' episode "The Sound of Terror."<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0624875/ "The Sound of Terror" episode cast, Internet Movie Database]</ref> It is not clear whether these portrayals factored into his casting in ''Star Trek''.

After refusing Roddenberry's 1964 offer to play [[Spock]], Kelley played Dr. [[Leonard McCoy|Leonard "Bones" McCoy]] from 1966 to 1969 in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. He reprised the character in a voice-over role in ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' (1973<U+2013>1974), and the first six ''Star Trek'' motion pictures (1979 to 1991). In one of the ''Star Trek'' comic books it was stated that Dr. McCoy's father had been a Baptist preacher, an idea that apparently came from Kelley's background. In 1987, he also had a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in "[[Encounter at Farpoint]]", the first episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]],'' as by-that-time Admiral Leonard McCoy, Star Fleet Surgeon General Emeritus {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. Several aspects of Kelley's background became part of McCoy's characterization, including his pronunciation of "nuclear" as "[[nucular|nookeler]]".

Kelley became good friends with ''Star Trek'' cast mates [[William Shatner]] and [[Leonard Nimoy]] from their first meeting in 1964. During ''Trek'''s first season, Kelley's name was listed in the end credits along with the rest of the cast. Only Shatner and Nimoy were listed in the opening credits. As Kelley's role grew in importance during the first season he received a pay raise to about $2,500 per episode, and received third billing starting in the second season after Nimoy. Despite the show's recognition of Kelley as one of its stars he was frustrated by the greater attention that Shatner received as its lead actor, and Nimoy received because of "Spockamania" among fans. Nonetheless, Kelley was very proud of the fact that he was the only one of the three who stayed married, saying "I'm happy in the [[San Fernando Valley|Valley]], with the very same wife."

Shy by his own admission, Kelley was the only cast member of the original ''Star Trek'' series program never to have written or published an autobiography; however, the authorized biography ''From Sawdust to Stardust'' (2005) was written posthumously by Terry Lee Rioux of [[Lamar University]] in [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], Texas.

===Later career===
[[File:DeForest Kelley - Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|[[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]
After ''Star Trek'', Kelley found himself a victim of the very [[typecasting (acting)|typecasting]] he had so feared. In 1972 he was cast in the horror film, ''[[Night of the Lepus]]''. Kelley thereafter did a few television appearances and a couple of movies but essentially went into ''de facto'' retirement other than playing McCoy.<ref name="marriott19910915">{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/15/arts/tv-view-the-star-trek-curse-a-lifetime-starfleet-commission.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm | title=TV VIEW; THE 'STAR TREK' CURSE: A LIFETIME STARFLEET COMMISSION | work=The New York Times | date=September 15, 1991 | accessdate=May 3, 2011 | author=Marriott, Michael}}</ref> By 1978 he was earning up to $50,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1978|r=-3}}}} today) annually from appearances at [[Star Trek convention|''Star Trek'' conventions]] attended by [[Trekkie]]s.<ref name="michaels19781210">{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cgsjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eswFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5061%2C5024378 | title=A Visit to Star Trek's Movie Launch | work=Parade | date=December 10, 1978 | accessdate=May 2, 2011 | author=Michaels, Marguerite}}</ref> Like other ''Star Trek'' actors Kelley received little of the enormous profits that the franchise generated for Paramount, until Nimoy, as executive producer, helped arrange for Kelley to be paid $1 million for ''[[Star Trek VI]]'' (1991) which would eventually be his final live action film appearance.<ref name=bio />

In a [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]] interview done in the late 1990s, Kelley said one of his biggest fears was that the words etched on his [[gravestone]] would be "[[He's dead, Jim]]". Reflecting this, Kelley's obituary in ''Newsweek'' magazine began: "We're not even going to try to resist: He's dead, Jim."<ref>''Newsweek'', July 20, 1999</ref> On the other hand, he stated that he was very proud to hear from so many ''Star Trek'' fans who had been inspired to become doctors as a result of his portrayal of Dr. McCoy.
For his final film, Kelley provided the voice of [[Viking 1]] in the 2nd/3rd instalment in the well-loved children's series ''[[The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars]]''.

Later in life, Kelley developed an interest in poetry, eventually publishing the first of two books in a series, ''The Big Bird's Dream'' and ''The Dream Goes On''&nbsp;<U+2013> a series he would never finish.

==Death==
Kelley died of [[stomach cancer]] on June 11, 1999. His body was cremated and the ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=5788 |title=DeForest Kelley (1920 - 1999) - Find A Grave Memorial |publisher=Findagrave.com |date=June 30, 1999 |accessdate=June 14, 2012}}</ref>
