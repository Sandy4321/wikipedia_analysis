The '''1893 New York hurricane''' was a powerful and destructive [[tropical cyclone]] that struck the [[New York City]] area in August 1893. First identified as a tropical storm on August 15, over the central [[Atlantic Ocean]], the hurricane moved northwestward for most of its course, ultimately peaking with [[maximum sustained winds]] of 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure reading of 952 mbar (hPa; 28.11 inHg). It turned due northward as it approached the [[U.S. East Coast]] and struck western [[Long Island]] on August 24. It moved inland and quickly deteriorated, degenerating the next day.

The storm inflicted severe damage with storm tides as high as {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Trees were brought down, houses were demolished, and [[Hog Island (New York)|Hog Island]] was largely washed away by the cyclone. Several areas suffered extensive effects from the hurricane, and at least 34 sailors lost their lives. The storm is regarded as one of the most severe hurricanes to strike the city.

==Meteorological history==

The system was first classified as a tropical storm while situated in the central [[Atlantic Ocean]] on August 15, 1893. It steadily intensified as it tracked generally towards the west and attained hurricane force. Gradually curving northwestward, the storm continued to gain power and, on August 18, it achieved wind speeds corresponding to [[SSHS#Category 2|Category 2]] intensity on the modern-day [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]].<ref name="hurdat">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|year=2009|accessdate=January 30, 2010|title=Easy-to-read HURDAT 1851-2008|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/easyread-2009.html}}</ref> This scale was devised in 1971 to categorize tropical cyclones based on their [[maximum sustained winds]].<ref name="USA Today">{{cite news|author=Jack Williams|title=Hurricane scale invented to communicate storm danger|publisher=''USA Today''|date= May 17, 2000|accessdate=February 3, 2010|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/hurricane/whscale.htm}}</ref> The storm is estimated to have maintained winds of approximately 100&nbsp;mph (155&nbsp;km/h) for several days as it passed well to the north of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. As the hurricane turned more northerly still, approaching the [[United States]], it strengthened to major hurricane intensity, Category 3, on August 22. At this point, it peaked in intensity with winds of 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h). The lowest known barometric pressure in relation to the storm was 952 mbar (hPa; 28.11 inHg).<ref name="hurdat"/>

Less than a day later, the storm deteriorated to Category 2 strength.<ref name="hurdat"/> [[Cape Hatteras, North Carolina]] experienced the hurricane on the morning of August 23 while its center passed less than {{convert|100|mi|km|abbr=on}} offshore. Heading nearly due northward, the cyclone skimmed the [[New Jersey]] coastline, passing just east of [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]],<ref name="MWR">{{cite web|publisher=National Weather Bureau|year=1894|accessdate=January 30, 2010|title=1893 Monthly Weather Review|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/mwreviews/1893.pdf|format=[[PDF]]}}</ref> and weakened further to Category 1 status.<ref name="hurdat"/> On August 23 the storm was one of four hurricanes occurring simultaneously within the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=NOAA Revisits Historic Hurricanes|date=|publisher=Hurricane Research Division|accessdate=April 16, 2010|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/}}</ref> On August 24 the storm moved ashore on western [[Long Island]], in the [[New York City]] area. At 1200 UTC that day, while centered just inland, its maximum winds were estimated to have been 85&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h). It progressed northward through [[New England]], quickly growing weaker. It was briefly downgraded to a tropical storm before becoming [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]].<ref name="hurdat"/> It dissipated fully on August 25, near the mouth of the [[Saint Lawrence River]].<ref name="MWR"/>

==Impact==
Winds from the storm exceeded {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at Atlantic City and New York, initially blowing from the northeast before shifting southwesterly.<ref name="MWR"/> The hurricane wrought severe destruction,<ref name="tracker">{{cite web|author=Aaron Naparstek|title=Storm Tracker|date=September 4, 2005|publisher=''New York'' magazine|accessdate=February 3, 2010|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/columns/intelligencer/12908/}}</ref> described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' on August 25 as "a mighty war of winds and a great tumbling of chimneys".<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|author=|title=Swept by Wind and Rain|date=August 25, 1893|publisher=''The New York Times''}}</ref> A {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[storm surge]] impacted the shore, demolishing structures.<ref name="tracker"/> The storm has been cited as an example of a noteworthy New York City tropical cyclone.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Roy Britt|title=History Reveals Hurricane Threat to New York City|date=June 1, 2005|publisher=Robert Roy Britt|accessdate=February 3, 2010|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/050601_hurricane_1938.html}}</ref> The cyclone is known for largely destroying [[Hog Island (New York)|Hog Island]], a developed island that existed south of the modern-day Long Island coast. The island peaked in size during the 1870s at about {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} long.<ref>{{cite web|author=Norimitsu Onishi|title=Queens Spit Tried to Be a Resort but Sank in a Hurricane|date=March 18, 1997|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=February 3, 2010|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/18/nyregion/queens-spit-tried-to-be-a-resort-but-sank-in-a-hurricane.html?scp=1&sq=%22hog+island%22+hurricane&st=nyt}}</ref>

The worst of the damage was reportedly confined to a {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} area surrounding New York City. In a 24-hour period, {{convert|3.82|in|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation fell, breaking the daily rainfall record. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses accompanied the severe impact. Low-lying areas of the city, particularly those near the coast, were flooded. Roofs and chimneys were ripped off buildings and windows were broken in many homes and businesses. In [[Central Park]], "More than a hundred noble trees were torn up by the roots, and branches were twisted off everywhere."<ref name="NYT"/> The park was devastated and thousands of dead birds fell to the ground after being washed out of, or drowned in, their nests. Groups of children gathered the birds and picked them up, with the apparent intention of selling them to restaurants.<ref name="NYT"/> The storm took the lives of 34 sailors as vessels were blown ashore and men swept overboard. The tugboat ''Panther'', towing two coal barges, was wrecked; 17 crew members perished and three lived.<ref name="NYT"/>

High winds brought down telegraph wires and left the city almost entirely cut off from communication with outside locations. At [[Coney Island]], the storm completely destroyed many buildings, walkways, piers, and beach resorts. [[Brighton Beach]] was hit particularly hard. The raging seas swept inland, washing out tracks of the Marine Railway.<ref name="NYT"/> Bathing houses were moved a great distance by the cyclone. Near the [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn|Sheepshead Bay]], Emmons Avenue was heavily damaged. Further to the east, at [[Greenport, Suffolk County, New York|Greenport]], numerous yachts were wrecked and scattered. Corn crops on land were ruined and fruit trees lost their fruits.<ref name="NYT"/>

At [[Brooklyn]], still an independent city from New York, houses were dismantled and uprooted trees blocked streets. Damage was widespread throughout the area and flood waters reached waist-high levels. The storm was the most severe in years at [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], despite the fact that its damage was moderate. Trees were blown down and cellars filled with water there and in nearby areas, such as [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]].<ref name="NYT"/>
