Since Madoff's arrest, the SEC has been criticized for its lack of financial expertise and lack of [[due diligence]], despite having received complaints from [[Harry Markopolos]] and others for almost a decade. The SEC's Inspector General, H.

At least some of the SEC investigators doubted whether Madoff was even trading.<ref name="Tonline">{{cite news |title=Wall Street legend Bernard Madoff arrested over '$50 billion Ponzi scheme' |work =[[The Times]] | publisher =[[Times Newspapers Ltd.]] |date =December 12, 2008 |url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5331997.ece |accessdate =December 13, 2008 | location=London |first=Deirdre |last=Hipwell}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/secpostmadoffreforms/oig-509-exec-summary.pdf |title=Report of Investigation Executive Summary |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=March 16, 2010}}</ref><ref>House Committee Financial Services, ''Investigations of Madoff Fraud Allegations, Part 1'' [http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&products_id=283836-1&showVid=true C-Span]</ref>

==Investment scandal==
{{Main|Madoff investment scandal}}
Concerns about Madoff's business surfaced as early as 1999, when financial analyst [[Harry Markopolos]] informed the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) that he believed it was legally and mathematically impossible to achieve the gains Madoff claimed to deliver. According to Markopolos, he knew within five minutes that Madoff's numbers didn't add up, and it took four hours of failed attempts to replicate them to conclude Madoff was a fraud.<ref name=Harry60Minutes>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/27/60minutes/main4833667.shtml | work=CBS News | title=The Man Who Figured Out Madoff's Scheme | date=February 27, 2009}}</ref> He was ignored by the Boston SEC in 2000 and 2001, as well as by Meaghan Cheung at the New York SEC in 2005 and 2007 when he presented further evidence. He has since published a book, [[No One Would Listen: A True Financial Thriller|''No One Would Listen'']], about the frustrating efforts he and his team made over a ten-year period to alert the government, the industry, and the press about the Madoff fraud.

Although Madoff's wealth management business ultimately grew into a multi-billion-dollar operation, none of the major derivatives firms traded with him because they didn't think his numbers were real. None of the major Wall Street firms invested with him either, and several high-ranking executives at those firms suspected he wasn't legitimate.<ref name=Harry60Minutes/>

Others also contended it was inconceivable that the growing volume of Madoff accounts could be competently and legitimately serviced by his documented accounting/auditing firm, a three-person firm with only one active accountant.<ref>Fitzgerald, Jim.

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] complaint says that during the first week of December 2008, Madoff confided to a senior employee, identified by [[Bloomberg News]] as one of his sons, that he said he was struggling to meet $7 billion in redemptions.<ref name="BB1213" /> According to the sons, Madoff told Mark Madoff on December 9 that he planned to pay out $173 million in bonuses two months early.<ref name='vfairmargolick'>{{cite news | first=David | last=Margolick | coauthors= |authorlink= David Margolick | title=The Madoff Chronicles, Part III: Did the Sons Know | date=July 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/07/madoff200907 | work =Vanity Fair | pages = | accessdate = June 25, 2009 | language = }}</ref> Madoff said that "he had recently made profits through business operations, and that now was a good time to distribute it."<ref name="BB1213" /> Mark told Andrew Madoff, and the next morning they went to their father's apartment and asked him how he could pay bonuses to his staff if he was having trouble paying clients.

Madoff posted $10 million [[bail]] in December 2008 and remained under 24-hour monitoring and [[house arrest]] in his [[Upper East Side]] [[penthouse apartment]] until March 12, 2009, when Judge [[Denny Chin]] revoked his bail and remanded him to the [[Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York|Metropolitan Correctional Center]]. Chin claimed Madoff was a flight risk, because of his age, wealth, and the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison.<ref name="Transcript" /> Prosecutors filed two [[asset]] forfeiture pleadings which include lists of valuable real and personal property as well as financial interests and entities.<ref name="DOJpbs" />

Madoff's lawyer, [[Ira Sorkin]], filed an [[appeal]], and prosecutors responded with a notice of opposition.

Picard has sued Madoff's sons, Mark and Andrew, his brother Peter, and Peter's daughter, Shana, for [[negligence]] and breach of [[fiduciary]] duty, for $198 million. The defendants had received over $80 million in compensation since 2001 and "used the bank account at BLMIS like a personal piggy bank." The trustee believes they knew about the fraud because of their personal investments in the scheme, the longevity of the fraud, and because of their work at the company including roles as corporate and compliance officers. Since 1995, Peter Madoff had invested only $32,146, but withdrew over $16 million. Mark and Andrew Madoff withdrew more than $35 million from a small original investment. Picard asserts Mark Madoff conspired with his father to hide $25 million in unknown Swiss accounts.<ref name="9270960Minutesp2">{{cite news

===Mechanics of the fraud===
According to the Securities and Exchange Commission indictment against Annette Bongiorno and Joann Crupi, two back office workers who worked for Madoff, they created false trading reports based on the returns that Madoff ordered for each customer.<ref name = NPT1110>[http://www.npr.org/2010/11/18/131413165/madoff-associates-arrested-on-undisclosed-charges "Two Charged With Helping Madoff Make Fake Trades"]. NPR. Associated Press. November 8, 2010. Retrieved November 19, 2010.{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> For example, once Madoff determined a customer's return, one of the back office workers would enter a false trade from a previous date and then enter a false closing trade in the amount of the required profit, according to the indictment.<ref name = Steinert>Steinert-Threlkeld, Tom (November 18, 2010).

They quote her as writing to a manager in the early 1990s "I need the ability to give any settlement date I want."<ref name = NPT1110/> In some cases returns were allegedly determined before the account was even opened.<ref name = Steinert/>

Madoff admitted during his March 2009 guilty plea that the essence of his scheme was to deposit client money into a Chase account, rather than invest it and generate steady returns as clients had believed. When clients wanted their money, "I used the money in the Chase Manhattan bank account that belonged to them or other clients to pay the requested funds," he told the court.<ref name = Stempel>{{Cite news|publisher=Reuters|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/02/us-madoff-jpmorgan-idUSTRE6B153220101202|accessdate=December 2, 2010|date=December 2, 2010|title=Madoff trustee sues JPMorgan for $6.4 billion|first=Jonathan|last=Stempel}}</ref>

===Size of loss to investors===
[[David Sheehan]], chief counsel to trustee Picard, stated on September 27, 2009, that about $36 billion was invested into the scam, returning $18 billion to investors, with $18 billion missing. About half of Madoff's investors were "net winners," earning more than their investment. The withdrawal amounts in the final six years were subject to "clawback" (return of money) lawsuits.<ref name="9270960Minutes">{{cite news

In a May 4, 2011 statement, trustee Picard said that the total fictitious amounts owed to customers (with some adjustments) were $57 billion, of which $17.3 billion was actually invested by the customers.  $7.6 billion has been recovered, but pending lawsuits, only $2.6 billion is available to repay victims.<ref name=final>[http://www.madofftrustee.com/ Irving H.

The Internal Revenue Service ruled that investors' capital loss in this and other fraudulent investment schemes will be treated as a business loss, thereby allowing the victims to claim them as net operating losses to reduce tax liability.<ref>[ftp://leginfo.public.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_0151-0200/sb_157_cfa_20110512_115158_sen_comm.html Bill Analysis SENATE GOVERNANCE & FINANCE COMMITTEE Senator Lois Wolk, Chair FRAUDULENT INVESTMENTS]</ref>

On March 12, 2009, Madoff pled guilty to 11 [[federal offense|federal]] felonies, including [[securities fraud]], [[wire fraud]], [[mail fraud]], [[money laundering]], [[making false statements]], [[perjury]], theft from an employee benefit plan, and making false filings with the SEC.<ref name="DOJPlea">http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/March09/madoffbernardpleapr.pdf</ref> The plea was the response to a criminal complaint filed two days earlier, which stated that over the past 20 years, Madoff had defrauded his clients of almost $65 billion in the largest [[Ponzi scheme]] in history. Madoff insisted he was solely responsible for the fraud.<ref name="wsj031209"/><ref name="Tonline" /> Madoff did not plea bargain with the government. Rather, he pleaded guilty to all charges.

In his plea [[allocution]], Madoff stated he began his Ponzi scheme in 1991. He admitted he had never made any legitimate investments with his clients' money during this time. Instead, he said, he simply deposited the money into his personal business account at [[Chase Manhattan Bank]]. When his customers asked for withdrawals, he paid them out of the Chase account<U+2014>a classic "robbing Peter to pay Paul" scenario.

Madoff apologized to his victims, saying, "I have left a legacy of shame, as some of my victims have pointed out, to my family and my grandchildren. This is something I will live in for the rest of my life. I'm sorry." He added, "I know that doesn't help you," after his victims recommended to the judge that he receive a life sentence. Chin had not received any mitigating letters from friends or family testifying to Madoff's good deeds.
