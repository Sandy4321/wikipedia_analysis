The '''[[MDNA Tour]]''' is the ninth concert tour by American recording artist [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in support of her twelfth studio album, ''[[MDNA (album)|MDNA]]''. It has been met with plenty of controvery, almost like her [[Blond Ambition World Tour|Blond Ambition Tour]], specially for the use of guns, nudity, promotion of LBGT rights and even political issues.

==Marine Le Pen==
During the song "Nobody Knows Me" in her concert in [[Tel Aviv]] on May 31, 2012, during a morphing collage the face of [[French people|French]] [[far right]] politician [[Marine Le Pen]] appeared on the screen with a [[swastika]] on her forehead.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/madonna/9310578/Marine-Le-Pen-threatens-to-sue-Madonna.html |title=Marine Le Pen threatens to sue Madonna|author= Samuel, Henry|date=4 June 2012 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |accessdate=23 July 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1343078357MASAKZHJFS |archivedate=23 July 2012 |location=London}}</ref>

At the performance in Nice, France at the Stade Charles-Ehrmann, many of Marine Le Pen's supporters had covered up the MDNA Tour announcement posters with [[Marine Le Pen]]'s campaign posters. It was even speculated that French far right was to attend the show.<ref>http://www.madonnaunderground.nl/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2797%3Afront-national-aanwezig-bij-mdna-in-nice&catid=22%3Aalgemeen&lang=en</ref> However, Madonna removed the swastika from the video of "Nobody Knows Me" and replaced it with a question mark. A local party supporter Gael Nofri welcomed the change stating: "As far as I know, Madonna has never changed a video clip. This is proof that our arguments were valid. This is excellent news." 

==Use of guns==
In wake of the [[2012 Aurora shooting]], Madonna was urged to remove the use of firearms from the show. Authorities previously warned the singer about use of guns for the concert in Edinburgh, before the events in [[Colorado]]. However, the order was reinforced after the tragedy occurred. Madonna continued the show in Scotland as planned, with the use of the props. During the concert, she expressed her joy for first concert in the country, saying she could be onstage for three hours. She then joked, "Due to your laws here they might pull the plug on me so if they cut us off suddenly, write to your local MP".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/2012/07/22/pop-superstar-madonna-ignores-gun-ban-as-she-plays-scots-gig-86908-23911281/ |title=Pop superstar Madonna ignores gun ban as she plays Scots gig |author=Lyons, Beverly|date=22 July 2012 |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]] |accessdate=23 July 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1343079499GTIVONUSYZ |archivedate=23 July 2012}}</ref>

Although threatened, Scottish police did not interrupt the show. Activist group, Mothers Against Guns, released a statement stating Madonna "should know better". They further stated the use of the props are in bad taste, even moreso after the Colorado shootings. The singer's camp responded saying, "Madonna would rather cancel her show than censor her art. Her entire career, she has fought against people telling her what she can and cannot do. She<U+2019>s not about to start listening to them now".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/23/madonna-guns-concert-photos_n_1694766.html?utm_hp_ref=entertainment |title=Madonna & Guns: Singer Brandishes Fake Pistols & Machine Guns Despite Warnings, Recent Events (PHOTOS) |author=Makarechi, Kia |date=23 July 2012 |work=The Huffington Post |publisher=AOL Inc |accessdate=23 July 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1343079799NJKZPFOOWU|archivedate=23 July 2012}}</ref>

==Nudity==
While performing her song "[[Human Nature (Madonna song)|Human Nature]]" in her concert in [[Istanbul]] on June 7, 2012, Madonna briefly exposed her right breast to the audience, before covering it up again.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/madonna/64234 |title=Madonna flashes nipple during gig in Istanbul|author= |date=10 June 2012 |work=[[NME]] |publisher=[[IPC Media]] |accessdate=23 July 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1343080140ZMXDIFQGCI |archivedate=23 July 2012}}</ref> [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|''The Sun'']] notes, "Her actions may have been offensive to some members of her audience, as Turkey is a traditionally Islamic country, with a largely Muslim population" before noting that "Perhaps fans shouldn't have been surprised - as she did warn them, writing No Fear on her back.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4364974/Madonna-shows-shes-Queen-of-Pop-ping-out-at-MDNA-tour-gig.html |title=Madonna shows shes Queen of Pop-ping out|author= |date=11 June 2012 |work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |publisher=[[News International]] |accessdate=23 July 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1343080267HVYVKHAKRK |archivedate=23 July 2012 |location=London}}</ref> On the other hand, Amy Odell from [[BuzzFeed]] said that criticizing the gesture based on her age send "a very archaic message", adding that "Women who are 53 still have breasts and... sex drives!".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buzzfeed.com/amyodell/leave-madonnas-53-year-old-breast-alone |title=Leave Madonna's 53-Year-Old Breast Alone|author=Odell, Amy|date=June 2012 |work=[[BuzzFeed]] |publisher= |accessdate=23 July 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1343080622SQCIDIJBYO |archivedate=23 July 2012}}</ref> Three days later, ''The Sun'' published an article entitled, "Madonna was right to bare her boob at 53." Three readers of the publication recreated the pose, photographed it, and sent it in to the publication to show their support for Madonna "as a positive role model for older women." While some initially claimed Madonna as "clingy" and "desperate", Sarah Angotti, also 53, counters, "I felt nervous when I pulled my bra down but that<U+2019>s only natural <U+2014> Madonna probably did too. But then I felt empowered, it was an incredible feeling." She goes on to say about Madonna, "She looks incredible now <U+2014> better than a woman half her age and better than many of the young girls in the charts now" before commenting on the criticism of Madonna exposing her breast as a parent, "If she is a good mother that<U+2019>s all that matters." Tina Shaw, also 53, argues Madonna "will not change" despite a double-standard between men and women, opining, "Women always seem to get the most flack when it comes to controversial situations. If it was a 53-year-old famous guy flashing his six-pack on stage, everyone would say, 'Wow, what a lad' but because it<U+2019>s a woman everyone is saying, 'What an old bag'". Lastly, Sue Scadding, 53 as well, negates the controversy, pointing out that "there are topless women out on the beach every day and nobody bats an eyelid...I mean, it<U+2019>s only a nipple for goodness sake".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4371665/Madonna-was-right-to-bare-her-boob-at-53.html|title=Madonna was right to bare her boob at 53 |author=Williams, Stewart |date=11 June 2012 |work=The Sun |publisher=News International |accessdate=23 July 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1343081055QQXYPSKVBO|archivedate=23 July 2012 |location=London}}</ref>

==L'Olympia show==
Madonna's second show in Paris at [[L'Olympia]] was met with overwhelmingly negative reviews from fans and critics, with most of the criticism centering on the fact that the concert lasted only 45 minutes, even though the tickets had been sold at the same price as for the other MDNA Tour shows and fans hadn't been alerted of the abbreviated format of the show. Responding to the criticism, Madonna's publicist declared that her past club shows "were never more than 45 minutes", adding that the concert was "planned as a heartfelt thank you to France which she expressed at the start of the show" and also, the show cost Madonna nearly $1 million to produce and keeping the prices at $100 involved a "tremendous effort".<ref>[http://www.timeslive.co.za/entertainment/music/2012/07/28/madonna-booed-after-45-minute-paris-concert Madonna booed after 45-minute Paris concert]</ref> According to TMZ, the riot at Madonna concert in Paris had nothing to do with her brief performance but with around 10 "fans" in the audience who overheard yelling about Marine Le Pen.<ref>http://m.tmz.com/article_head.ftl?id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tmz.com%2F2012%2F07%2F29%2Fmadonna-france-concert-riot%2F</ref> However, several French news outlets reported that the backlash against Madonna's performance was started by a considerable number of fans rather than an isolated group of Marine Le Pen supporters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/laparisienne/actu-people/madonna-conspuee-sur-le-web-apres-son-concert-a-l-olympia-27-07-2012-2104458.php|title=Madonna conspu<U+00E9>e sur le Web apr<U+00E8>s son concert <U+00E0> L'Olympia|author= |date=27 July 2012 |work=[[Le Parisien]] |publisher=[[LES]] |accessdate=27July 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1338791671UPDVLAKGOI |archivedate=31 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/musique/2012/07/27/03006-20120727ARTFIG00530-madonna-sur-twitter-la-reine-est-morte.php|title=Madonna sur Twitter: "La Reine est Morte |author= |date=27 July 2012 |work=[[Le Figaro]] |publisher=[[LES]] |accessdate=27 July 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1338791671UPDVLAKGOI |archivedate=31 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.fr/Loisirs/Musique/News/Madonna-huee-par-ses-fans-apres-son-concert-a-l-Olympia-2130804 |title=Madonna hu<U+00E9>e par ses fans apr<U+00E8>s son concert <U+00E0> L'Olympia |publisher=elle.com |date=2012-07-27 |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref>

==Pussy Riot==
Madonna's Russian shows in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] were met with great controversy. Asked her stance on the arrest of feminist punk-rock band [[Pussy Riot]], Madonna responded: "I'm against censorship, and my whole career I've always promoted freedom of expression and [[freedom of speech]] so I think what's happening to them is unfair. And I hope that they don't have to serve 7 years in jail; that would be a tragedy. I think art should be political, that art, historically speaking, always reflects what's going on socially. So for me it's hard to separate being an artist and being political."<ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newsvideo/9458246/Madonna-calls-for-leniency-in-Pussy-Riot-trial-during-Russian-leg-of-world-tour.html</ref> During her [[Moscow]] show, Madonna gave a speech in support of the band, saying "...My dream, and my prayer, is that everyone in the world has the right to express their opinions and still be treated as human beings. I know there are many sides to every story, and I mean no disrespect to the Church, or the government, but I think that these three girls -- Nadezhda, Yekaterina, and Maria -- have done something courageous. I think that they have paid the price for this act. And I pray for their freedom."<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/video/2012/aug/08/madonna-pussy-riot-moscow-video</ref>  Madonna later appeared on stage with a [[temporary tattoo]] that said "Pussy Riot" on her back in place of the usual "No Fear" slogan, and performed "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]" donning a balaclava covering her face, the band's trademark.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/08/08/madonna-supports-pussy-riot_n_1755804.html</ref> It was considered an artistic statement against the oppression of the band's [[freedom of speech]].<ref>http://ca.omg.yahoo.com/news/madonna-dons-balaclava-moscow-show-support-jailed-members-135327129.html</ref>

The response was largely positive. Many media outlets lauded Madonna's efforts, and other artists joined her in support of the band, among them [[Yoko Ono]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Peter Gabriel]].<ref>http://bbc-worldnews.net/2012/08/peter-gabriel-joins-madonna-paul-mccartney-in-backing-pussy-riot/</ref> [[Pussy Riot]] themselves tweeted: "DEAR MADONNA! We love you and you just might be changing Russia's history right now. Thank you and a thousand prayers in return!"<ref>http://www.nme.com/news/madonna/65390</ref> Deputy Prime Minister [[Dmitry Rogozin]], however, wrote an expletive-ridden [[Twitter]] post lambasting Madonna for backing the band: "With age, every ex-slut tends to lecture everybody on morality. Especially during world tours and concerts."<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/09/pussy-riot-madonna-called-moralising-slut</ref> Madonna's second Russian date in [[Saint Petersburg]] was consequently met with terrorist threats, prompting the U.S. Embassy to issue a warning to those in attendance.<ref name="cnn.com">http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/07/showbiz/russia-madonna/index.html</ref> Madonna's spokesperson Liz Rosenberg responded that the concert would go on as scheduled and that Russian authorities would step up security for the date.<ref name="cnn.com"/>

Following threats of arrest by Russian officials if she spoke in support of [[gay rights]] and opposed the recent anti-gay law which prohibits "public actions aimed at propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality, and transgenderism among minors", Madonna responded, on March 21, in a letter on her website:

{{Quote|I'm a freedom fighter. My show. My songs. My work. My art, is all about freedom of expression. Freedom to choose to speak to act. Always with humanity and compassion. I will come to St. Petersburg to speak up for the gay community, to support the gay community and to give strength and inspiration to anyone who is or feels oppressed. I don't run away from adversity. I will speak during my show about this ridiculous atrocity.<ref name="madonna.com">http://www.madonna.com/news/title/madonna-answers-st-petersburgs-controversy</ref><ref name="madonna.com"/><ref name="tv.ibtimes.com">http://tv.ibtimes.com/anti-gay-law-to-take-effect-in-russia-s-second-city-st-petersburg/4200.html</ref><ref name="tv.ibtimes.com"/> }}

==LGBT rights==
Before the show, Madonna released pink wristbands to audience members in support of the [[LGBT community]].<ref>http://madonna.com/news/title/support-the-gay-lesbian-community-at-madonnas-st-petersburg-show</ref> In addition, hundreds brought rainbow flags to the show and waved them throughout. Madonna stopped in the middle of the show to speak on the issues at hand: "...I feel that people are becoming more and more afraid of people who are different. People are becoming more and more intolerant, but we can make a difference...we don't have to do it with violence, but love." She continued, noting [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] as a fighter for the equal rights of African Americans, and stating, "I am here to say that the gay community and gay people here, and all around the world, have the same rights, to be treated with dignity, respect, tolerance, compassion, and love." She then asked the audience to raise their wristbands with her to show their "love and support of the gay community." She concluded, "for people quoting the [[Bible]], and using [[God]] as a defense mechanism: [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]], [[Buddha]], and [[Moses]] preached this -- it's in every Holy book -- 'love thy neighbour as thyself'. You can not use religion, or God's name, to treat other people badly. So let's go out into the world, and spread this message of love, and live our lives without fear. Amen."<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnEUMA-nPd4</ref><ref>http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/music/2012/08/10/madonna-transforms-st-petersburg-concert-unofficial-gay-pride</ref>

Though her speech was met with much praise from the media, on August 17, it was announced that anti-gay Russian campaigners would sue Madonna for $10.4 million, arguing that she was promoting "homosexual propaganda" which was against the law, and allegedly "insulted their feelings when she spoke out for gay rights" at the concert.<ref name="guardian">http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/17/madonna-sued-gay-rights-russia?newsfeed=true</ref> According to one of the 10 activists who filed the lawsuit, "She (Madonna) had been warned with words that she should behave in line with the law and she ignored it. So we will speak in the language of money...maybe someone does not see the link but after Madonna<U+2019>s concert maybe some boy becomes gay, some girl becomes lesbian, fewer children are born as a result and this big country cannot defend its borders - for me it causes moral suffering."<ref>http://www.torontosun.com/2012/08/17/anti-gay-activists-sue-madonna-over-hurt-feelings</ref>

On August 18, [[Pussy Riot]] members were found guilty and sentenced to two years in prison.<ref>http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/fury_over_pussy_whippin_1vxUnTGTJYxhmK2syCfX0M</ref> In response, Madonna wrote on her website in further support of the band: "I protest the conviction and sentencing of Pussy Riot to a penal colony for two years for a 40 second performance extolling their political opinions. Even if one disagrees with the location or how they chose to express themselves, the sentence is too harsh and in fact is inhumane. I call on all those who love freedom to condemn this unjust punishment. I urge artists around the world to speak up in protest against this travesty. They've spent enough time in jail. I call on ALL of Russia to let Pussy Riot go free."<ref>http://madonna.com/news/title/temp</ref>

Madonna also continued to back and defend Pussy Riot and preach for equality and freedom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/33/50950/Arts--Culture/Music/Madonna-drops-swastika-from-France-concert,-backs-.aspx|title=Madonna drops swastika from France concert, backs Pussy Riot|publisher=Ahram Online|date=August 22, 2012|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref>
