'''The Hoysala Empire''' ([[Kannada]]: <U+0CB9><U+0CCA><U+0CAF><U+0CCD><U+0CB8><U+0CB3> <U+0CB8><U+0CBE><U+0CAE><U+0CCD><U+0CB0><U+0CBE><U+0C9C><U+0CCD><U+0CAF>) ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|pronunciation]]: {{Audio-IPA|Hoysala_Empire.ogg|[hojs<U+0259><U+026D><U+0259> sa<U+02D0>mra<U+02D0>d<U+0292>j<U+0259>]}} in Kannada) was a prominent [[South India]]n empire that ruled most of the modern day state of [[Karnataka]] between the 10th and the 14th centuries. The capital of the empire was initially based at [[Belur]] but was later moved to [[Halebidu]]. 

The Hoysala rulers were originally hill peoples of [[Malnad]] Karnataka, an elevated region in the [[Western Ghats]] range. In the 12th century, taking advantage of the internecine warfare between the then ruling [[Western Chalukyas]] and [[Kalachuri]] kingdoms, they annexed areas of present day Karnataka and the fertile areas north of the [[Kaveri River]] delta in present day [[Tamil Nadu]]. By the 13th century, they governed most of present-day Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and parts of western [[Andhra Pradesh]] in [[Deccan]] India.

The Hoysala era was an important period in the development of art, architecture, and religion in [[South India]]. The empire is remembered today primarily for its temple [[Hoysala architecture|architecture]]. Over a hundred surviving temples are scattered across Karnataka, including the well known [[Chennakesava Temple]] at Belur, the [[Hoysaleswara temple|Hoysaleswara Temple]] at Halebidu, and the [[Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura|Kesava Temple]] at Somanathapura. The Hoysala rulers also patronised the fine arts. This patronage encouraged literature to flourish in [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit]]. 

==History==
[[Image:Hoysala emblem.JPG|thumb|right|Sala fighting the tiger, the symbol of ''Hoysala Empire'']]
[[Kannada language|Kannada]] folklore tells of a young man, Sala, who was instructed by his [[Jain]] guru Sudatta to strike dead a tiger he encountered near the temple of the Goddess Vasantika at Sosevur. The word "strike" literally translates to "hoy" in [[Kannada literature#Old Kannada (haLegannaDa)|Hale Kannada]] (Old Kannada), hence the name "Hoy-sala". This legend first appeared in the Belur inscription  of Vishnuvardhana (1117), but owing to several inconsistencies in the Sala story  it remains in the realm of folklore.<ref name="legend">Historians feel that Sala was a mythical founder of the empire, Suryanath U. Kamath, ''A Concise History of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present'', 2001, Jupiter books, MCC, (Reprinted 2002), pp 123</ref><ref name="legend1">C. Hayavadhana Rao, J. D. M. Derrett, B. R Joshi call the Sala story a legend, {{cite web|title=History of Karnataka-Hoysalas and their contributions|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm|author=Arthikaje, Mangalore|publisher=1998-2000 OurKarnataka.Com, Inc|work=|accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref> The legend may have came into existence or gained popularity after King Vishnuvardhana's victory over the [[Cholas]] at [[Talakad]] as the Hoysala emblem depicts the fight between the mythical Sala and a tiger, the emblem of the Cholas.<ref name="emblem">S. Settar asserts the myth and the emblem was a creation of King Vishnuvardhana. Another  opinion is the emblem symbolically narrates the wars between the early Hoysala chieftains and the Cholas, Suryanath U. Kamath, ''A Concise History of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present'', 2001, Jupiter books, MCC, (Reprinted 2002), p123</ref> 

Early inscriptions, dated 1078 and 1090, have implied that the Hoysalas were descendants of the [[Yadava]] by referring to  the Yadava ''vamsa'' (clan) as Hoysala ''vamsa''. But there are no records directly linking  the  Hoysalas to the Yadavas of North India.<ref name="yadava">Calling it poetic fancy, William Coelho, author of ''Hoysala Vamsa'', 1950, argues that there is no evidence of even a tradition that traces back their lineage to one of Northern origin. S.U. Kamath argues that it was a common practice in royal families of medieval South India to build [[Puranas|puranic]] genealogies-Suryanath U. Kamath, ''A Concise History of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present'', 2001, Jupiter books, MCC, (Reprinted 2002), p122</ref>
<!--  [[Image:Kudremukh national park.jpg|thumb|Hoysala country, ''[[malnad]]'' [[Karnataka]]]] -->
Historians refer to the founders of the dynasty as natives of [[Malnad]] [[Karnataka]], based on numerous inscriptions calling them ''Maleparolganda'' or "Lord of the Male (hills) chiefs" (''Malepas'').<ref name="male">According to B.L. Rice et. al. (''Mysore and Coorg from Inscriptions'', 1909)-Suryanath U.

Kamath, ''A Concise History of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present'', 2001, Jupiter books, MCC, (Reprinted 2002), p123</ref><ref name=earlyorigin2"> N. Subrahmaniam, B. L. Rice and C. Hayavadana Rao also claim they were natives of Malnad Karnataka. B.R. Joshi however argues the Hoysalas were originally a community of people called ''Hosaleru'' in [[Uttara Kannada district]], {{cite web|title=History of Karnataka-Hoysalas and their contributions|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm|author=Arthikaje, Mangalore|publisher=1998-2000 OurKarnataka.Com, Inc|work=|accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref> 

The first Hoysala family record is dated 950 and names  Arekalla as the chieftain,  followed by Maruga and Nripa Kama I (976). The next ruler, Munda (1006&ndash;1026), was succeeded by Nripa Kama II who held such titles as ''Permanadi'' that show an early alliance with the [[Gangas|Western Ganga dynasty]].<ref name="Early Chiefs"> According to Seetharam Jagirdhar, M.N. Prabhakar, B.S. Krishnaswamy Iyengar, Suryanath U. Kamath, ''A Concise History of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present'', 2001, Jupiter books, MCC, Bangalore (Reprinted 2002), p123</ref> 
From these modest beginnings, the Hoysala dynasty began its transformation into a strong subordinate of the [[Western Chalukyas]]. Through [[Vishnuvardhana]]'s expansive military conquests, the Hoysalas  achieved the status of a real kingdom for the first time.<ref name="dignity"> King Vishnuvardhana made many military conquests later to be further expanded by his successors into one of the most powerful empires of [[South India]], says William Coelho.  He was the true maker of the Hoysala kingdom as this was a period of significant religious and cultural activity, says  B.S.K. Iyengar. According to [[P.B. Desai]], Vishnuvardhana was practically an independent king by the latter part of his rule, Suryanath U. Kamath, ''A Concise History of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present'', 2001, Jupiter books, MCC, (Reprinted 2002), p124, p126</ref> He wrested [[Mysore State|Gangavadi]] from the Cholas in 1116 and moved the capital from Belur to Halebidu. 
{{Hoysala Kings Infobox}}
Vishnuvardhana's ambition of creating an independent empire was fulfilled by his grandson Veera Ballala II, who freed the Hoysalas from subordination in 1187. Thus the Hoysalas began as subordinates of the [[Western Chalukyas]] and gradually established their own empire in Karnataka with such strong Hoysala kings as Vishnuvardhana, [[Veera Ballala II]] and later [[Veera Ballala III]]. During this time, [[Deccan Plateau|peninsular India]] saw a four way struggle for hegemony - [[Pandya]], [[Kakatiya]] and [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri]] being the other kingdoms.<ref name="hegemony"> Their mutual competition and antagonisms were the main feature during this period, Nilakanta Sastri, K.A. (1955), ''A History of South India, From Prehistoric times to fall of Vijayanagar'', OUP, (Reprinted 2002),  p192</ref> Veera Ballala II defeated the aggressive Pandya when they invaded the Chola kingdom and assumed the title "Establisher of the Chola Kingdom" (''Cholarajyapratishtacharya''), "Emperor of the south" (''Dakshina Chakravarthi'') and "Hoysala emperor" (''Hoysala Chakravarthi'').<ref name="greatest"> Barrett and William Coelho have called him the most outstanding of all the Hoysala kings and the one who fulfilled the dream of his illustrious grandfather Vishnuvardhana of making an independent empire,  Suryanath U. Kamath, ''A Concise History of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present'', 2001, Jupiter books, MCC, (Reprinted 2002), p126</ref> He founded  the city of [[Bangalore]] according to Kannada folklore.<ref name="legend>{{cite web|title=The City of Boiled Beans|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/25/stories/2002072500270200.htm|author=K.

The Hoysalas extended their foothold in [[Ancient Tamil country|Tamil country]] around 1225, making the city of Kannanur Kuppam near [[Srirangam]] a provincial capital and giving them control over South Indian politics that began a period of Hoysala hegemony in the Southern deccan.<ref name="arbiters">According to B.S.K.

Major political changes were taking place in the Deccan region in the early 14th century when significant areas of [[North India|northern India]] were under Muslim rule. [[Alla-ud-din Khilji]], the Sultan of Delhi, was determined to bring  isolated [[South India]] under his domain and sent his commander, [[Malik Kafur]], on  a southern expedition to plunder the Seuna capital [[Devagiri]] in 1311. The Seuna empire was subjugated by 1318 and the Hoysala capital Halebidu (also called Dorasamudra or Dwarasamudra) was sacked twice, in 1311 and 1327.<ref name="change">Suryanath U. Kamath, ''A Concise History of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present'', 2001, Jupiter books, MCC, (Reprinted 2002), p129</ref>

By 1336, the Sultan had conquered the Pandyas of Madurai, the Kakatiyas of [[Warangal]] and the tiny kingdom of Kampili. The Hoysalas were the only remaining Hindu empire who resisted the invading armies. Veera Ballala III stationed himself at [[Tiruvannamalai]] and offered stiff resistance to invasions from the north and the Sultanate of Madurai to the south. Then, after nearly two decades of resistance, Veera Ballala III was killed  at the battle of Madurai in 1343 and the sovereign territories of the Hoysala empire were merged with the areas administered by [[Harihara I]] in the [[Tungabhadra]] region.<ref name="commander">While many theories exist about the origin of Harihara I and his brothers, collectively known as the Sangama brothers, it is well accepted that they administered the northern territories of the Hoysala empire in the 1336-1343 time either as Hoysala commanders or with autonomous powers, Suryanath U. Kamath, ''A Concise History of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present'', 2001, Jupiter books, MCC, (Reprinted 2002), pp 159-160</ref> This new Hindu kingdom resisted the northern invasions and would later prosper and come to be known as the [[Vijayanagara Empire]].<ref name="patronage">A collaboration between the waning Hoysala kingdom and the emerging Hindu Vijayanagara empire is proven by inscriptions. The queen of Veera Ballala III, Krishnayitayi, made a grant to the [[Sringeri]] monastery on the same day as the founder of the Vijayanagara empire, Harihara I in 1346. The Sringeri monastic order was patronised by both Hoysala and Vijayanagara empires, Suryanath U. Kamath, ''A Concise History of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present'', 2001, Jupiter books, MCC, (Reprinted 2002), p161, </ref>

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Hoysala empire}}

The Hoysala administration supported itself through revenues from an agrarian economy.<ref name="irr">Suryanath U. Kamath, ''A Concise History of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present'', 2001, Jupiter books, MCC, (Reprinted 2002), p132</ref> The kings gave grants of land as rewards for service to beneficiaries who then became landlords to tenants producing agricultural goods and forest products. There were two types of landlords (''gavunda''); ''gavunda'' of people (''praja gavunda'') was lower in status than the wealthy lord of ''gavundas'' (''prabhu gavunda'').<ref name="gowda">Romila Thapar, ''The Penguin History of Early India, From Origin to 1300 AD'', 2003, Penguin, p378</ref>  The highlands (''[[malnad]]'' regions) with its [[temperate]] climate was suitable for raising cattle and the planting of orchards and spices. [[Paddy field|Paddy]] and corn were staple crops in the [[tropical]] plains (''Bailnad''). The Hoysalas collected taxes on  irrigation systems including tanks, reservoirs with [[sluice]]s, [[canal]]s and wells which were built and maintained at the expense of local villagers. [[Irrigation tank]]s such as ''Vishnusagara'', ''Shantisagara'', ''Ballalarayasagara'' were created at the expense of the state.<ref name="sagara">Suryanath U. Kamath, ''A Concise History of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present'', 2001, Jupiter books, MCC, (Reprinted 2002), p132</ref>
 
Importing horses for use as general transportation and in army cavalries of Indian kingdoms was a flourishing business on the western seaboard.<ref name="horses">Marco Polo who claims to have travelled in India at this time wrote of a monopoly in horse trading by the Arabs and merchants of South India. Imported horses became an expensive commodity because horse breeding was never successful in India, perhaps due to the different climatic, soil and pastoral conditions,Romila Thapar, ''The Penguin History of Early India, From Origin to 1300 AD'', 2003, Penguin, p383</ref> The forests were harvested for rich woods such as [[teak]] which was exported through ports located in the area of present day [[Kerela]].

The village assembly was responsible for collecting government land taxes. Land revenue was called ''Siddhaya'' and included the original assessment (''Kula'') plus various cesses.<ref name="cess">Suryanath U.

==Administration==
{{main|Hoysala administration}}
[[Image:Hoysalesvara garuda pillar.jpg|thumb|right|''Garuda'' pillar, 1121, [[Halebidu]]]]
In its administrative practices, the Hoysala Empire followed some of the well-established and proven methods of its predecessors covering administrative functions such as cabinet organisation  and command, the structure of local governing bodies and the division of territory.<ref name="govern">Suryanath U. Kamath, ''A Concise History of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present'', 2001, Jupiter books, MCC, (Reprinted 2002), pp 130-131</ref> Records show the names of many high ranking positions reporting directly to the king. Senior ministers were called ''Pancha Pradhanas'', ministers responsible for foreign affairs were  designated ''Sandhivigrahi'' and the chief treasurer was ''Mahabhandari'' or ''Hiranyabhandari''. ''Dandanayakas'' were in charge of armies and the chief justice of the Hoysala court was the ''Dharmadhikari''.

The kingdom was divided into  provinces named ''Nadu'', ''Vishaya'', ''Kampana'' and ''Desha'',  listed in descending order of geographical size.<ref name="Administration">Dr. Barrett opined that it is not clear which among ''Vishaya'' and ''Nadu'' was bigger in area and that a ''Nadu'' was under the supervision of the commander  (''Dandanayaka''), Suryanath U. Kamath, ''A Concise History of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present'', 2001, Jupiter books, MCC, (Reprinted 2002), pp 130-31</ref> Each province had a local governing body consisting of a minister (''Mahapradhana'') and a treasurer (''Bhandari'') that reported to the ruler of that province (''Dandanayaka''). Under this local ruler were officials called ''Heggaddes'' and ''Gavundas'' who hired and supervised the local farmers and labourers recruited to till the land. Subordinate ruling clans such as [[Alupas]] continued to govern their respective territories while following the policies set by the empire. 

An elite and well trained force of bodyguards known as ''Garudas'' protected the members of the royal family at all times. These servants moved closely yet inconspicuously by the side of their master, their loyalty being so complete that they committed suicide after his death.<ref name="light">Shadow like, they moved closely with the king, lived near him and disappeared upon the death of their master, {{cite web|title=Hoysala Heritage|url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm|author=S.

The Garuda pillar at the Hoysaleswara temple in Halebidu was erected in honor of Kuvara Lakshma, a minister and bodyguard of King Veera Ballala II.<br>

King Vishnuvardhana's coins had the legends "victor at Nolambavadi" (''Nolambavadigonda''), "victor at Talakad" (''Talakadugonda''), "victor of the hills"  (''Malaparolgonda'') in [[Kannada script|Kannada]] and [[Devanagari]] scripts.<ref name="Nolamba">Many Coins with Kannada legends have been discovered from the rule of the Hoysalas, p12, Suryanath U.

The defeat of the Jain Western Ganga Dynasty by the Cholas in early 11th century and the rising numbers of  followers of [[Vaishnava|Vaishnava Hinduism]] and [[Virashaivism]] in the 12th century was mirrored by a decreased interest in [[Jainism]].<ref name="jain">Suryanath U. Kamath, ''A Concise History of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present'', 2001, Jupiter books, MCC, (Reprinted 2002), pp 112, 132</ref> Two notable locations of Jain worship in the Hoysala territory were [[Shravanabelagola]] and [[Kambadahalli]]. The decline of [[Buddhism]] in South India began in the 8th century with the spread of [[Adi Shankara]]'s [[Advaita]] philosophy.<ref name="decrease">A 16th century Buddhist work by Lama Taranatha speaks disparagingly of Shankaracharya as close parallels in some beliefs of Shankaracharya with Buddhist philosophy was not viewed favourably by Buddhist writers, Romila Thapar, ''The Penguin History of Early India, From Origin to 1300 AD'', 2003, Penguin, pp 349-350, 397</ref> The only places of Buddhist worship during the Hoysala time were at [[Dambal]] and [[Balligavi]]. Shantala Devi, queen of Vishnuvardhana was a Jain but nevertheless commissioned the Hindu Kappe Chennigaraya temple in Belur, evidence that the royal family was tolerant of all religions. During the rule of the Hoysalas, three important religious developments took place in present day Karnataka inspired by three philosophers, [[Basavanna]], [[Madhvacharya]] and [[Ramanujacharya]].<br> 

While the origin of [[Virashaiva]] faith is debated, the movement grew through its association with Basavanna in the 12th century.<ref name="basava">It is said five earlier saints Renuka, Daruka, Ekorama, Panditharadhya and Vishwaradhya were the original founders of Virashaivism, a sect that preaches devotion to Lord Shiva, Suryanath U. Kamath, ''A Concise History of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present'', 2001, Jupiter books, MCC, (Reprinted 2002), p152</ref> Basavanna and other Virashaiva saints preached of a faith without a [[Indian caste system|caste system]]. In his [[Vachanas]] he appealed to the masses in simple Kannada and wrote "work is worship" (''Kayakave Kailasa'').

The impact of these religious developments on culture, literature, poetry and architecture in South India was profound. Important works of literature and poetry based on the teachings of these  philosophers were written during the coming centuries.

===Society===
{{main|Society in Hoysala empire}}
[[Image:Belur shilabalika1.JPG|thumb|right|Dancer, 1117, (''Madanika'')]] 
Hoysala society in many ways reflected the emerging religious, political and cultural developments of those times. During this period, the society became increasingly sophisticated. The status of women was varied. Some royal women were involved in administrative matters as shown in contemporary records describing  Queen Umadevi's administration of  Halebidu in the absence of Veera Ballala II  during his long military campaigns in northern territories. She also fought and defeated some antagonistic [[Feudalism|feudal rebels]].<ref name="progress">This is in stark contrast to the literature of the time (like ''Vikramankadeva Charita'' of Bilhana) that portrayed women as retiring,  overly romantic and unconcerned with affairs of the state, Romila Thapar, ''The Penguin History of Early India, From Origin to 1300 AD'', 2003, Penguin, p392</ref> Records describe the participation of women in the fine arts, such as  Queen Shantala Devi's skill in dance and music, and the 12th century [[Vachana]] poet  and  [[Virashaiva]] mystic [[Akka Mahadevi]]'s  devotion to the ''bhakti''  movement is well known.<ref name="temporal">She was not only a pioneer in the era of Women's emancipation but also an example of a transcendental world-view, Romila Thapar, ''The Penguin History of Early India, From Origin to 1300 AD'', 2003, Penguin, p392</ref> Temple dancers (''[[Devadasi]]'') were common and some were well educated and accomplished in the arts.

Trade on the west coast brought many foreigners to India including Arabs, Jews, [[Persians]], Chinese and people from the [[Malay]] peninsula.<ref name="foreign">Nilakanta Sastri, K.A. (1955), ''A History of South India, From Prehistoric times to fall of Vijayanagar'', OUP, (Reprinted 2002), p286</ref> Migration of people within Southern India as a result of the expansion of the empire produced an influx of new cultures and skills.<ref name="migrate">Royal patronage of education, arts, architecture, religion and establishment of new forts and military outposts caused the large scale relocation of people, Nilakanta Sastri, K.A. (1955), ''A History of South India, From Prehistoric times to fall of Vijayanagar'', OUP, (Reprinted 2002), p287</ref> In South India, towns were called ''Pattana'' or ''Pattanam'' and the marketplace, ''Nagara'' or ''Nagaram'', the marketplace serving as the nuclei of a city. Some towns such as [[Shravanabelagola]] developed from a religious settlement in the 7th century to an important trading center by the 12th century with the arrival of rich traders, while  towns like Belur attained the atmosphere of a regal city when King Vishnuvardhana built the Chennakesava Temple there. Large temples supported by royal patronage served religious, social, and judiciary purposes, elevating the king to the level of "God on earth".

Temple building served a commercial as well as a religious function and was not limited to any particular sect of Hinduism. [[Shaiva]] merchants of Halebidu financed the construction of the Hoysaleswara temple to compete with the Chennakesava temple built at Belur, elevating Halebidu to an important city as well. Hoysala temples however were secular and encouraged pilgrims of all Hindu sects, the Kesava temple at Somanathapura being an exception with strictly Vaishnava sculptural depictions.<ref name="merchant">{{cite web|title=Hoysala Heritage|url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm|author=S.

===Literature===
[[Image:Jaintemple halebidu dk.jpg|thumb|right|Jain temple, [[Halebidu]]]]
{{Main|Hoysala literature}}
Although [[Sanskrit literature]] remained popular during the Hoysala rule, royal patronage of local Kannada scholars increased. In the 12th century some works were written  in the ''Champu'' style,<ref name="mixstyle">Any composition which is written in a mixed prose-verse style is called ''Champu'', R. Narasimhacharya, History of Kannada Literature, 1988, Asian Educational Services, 1988, p12</ref> but  distinctive Kannada  metres  became more widely accepted. The ''Sangatya'' metre used in compositions,<ref name="sangatya">A ''Sangatya'' composition is meant to be sung to the accompaniment of a musical instrument, Nilakanta Sastri, K.A. (1955), ''A History of South India, From Prehistoric times to fall of Vijayanagar'', OUP, (Reprinted 2002), p359</ref> ''Shatpadi'', ''Tripadi'' metres in verses (seven and three line) and ''Ragale'' (lyrical poems) became fashionable. Jain works continued to extol the virtues of [[Tirthankaras]] (Jain ascetics).<ref name="vogue">Nilakanta Sastri, K.A. (1955), ''A History of South India, From Prehistoric times to fall of Vijayanagar'', OUP, (Reprinted 2002), p361</ref>

The Hoysala court supported scholars such as [[Janna]], Rudrabhatta, Harihara and his nephew  Raghavanka, whose works are enduring masterpieces in Kannada. In 1209, the  [[Jain]] scholar Janna wrote ''Yashodharacharite'', the story of a king who intends to perform a ritual sacrifice of two young boys to a local deity, Mariamma. Taking pity on the boys, the king releases them and gives up the practice of human sacrifice.<ref name="scarifice">Nilakanta Sastri, K.A. (1955), ''A History of South India, From Prehistoric times to fall of Vijayanagar'', OUP, (Reprinted 2002), p359</ref> In honour of this work, Janna received the title "Emperor among poets" (''Kavichakravarthi'') from King Veera Ballala II.<ref name="kavichakra">R. Narasimhacharya, History of Kannada Literature, 1988, Asian Educational Services, 1988, p20</ref>

Rudrabhatta,  a [[Smartha]] Brahmin (believer of monistic philosophy), was the earliest well known [[Brahminical]] writer whose patron was Chandramouli, a minister of King Veera Ballala II.<ref name="brahmin">Nilakanta Sastri, K.A. (1955), ''A History of South India, From Prehistoric times to fall of Vijayanagar'', OUP, (Reprinted 2002), p364</ref> Based on the earlier work of ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'', he wrote ''Jagannatha Vijaya'' in  the ''Champu'' style relating the life of Lord [[Krishna]] leading up to his fight with the demon [[Banasura]]. 

Harihara, (also known as Harisvara) a [[Virashaiva]] writer and the patron of King Narasimha I, wrote the ''Girijakalyana'' in the old Jain ''Champu'' style which describes the marriage of Lord [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] in ten sections.<ref name="Parvati">Nilakanta Sastri, K.A. (1955), ''A History of South India, From Prehistoric times to fall of Vijayanagar'', OUP, (Reprinted 2002), p362</ref><ref name="Parvati1">R. Narasimhacharya, History of Kannada Literature, 1988, Asian Educational Services, 1988, p20</ref> He was one of the earliest Virashaiva writers who was not part of the ''[[Vachana]]'' literary tradition. He came from a family of accountants (''Karanikas'') from Halebidu and spent many years in [[Hampi]] writing more than one hundred ''Ragales'' (poems in blank verse) in praise of Lord [[Virupaksha]]  (a form of Lord Shiva). Raghavanka was the first to introduce the ''Shatpadi'' metre into Kannada literature in  his ''Harishchandra kavya'' which is considered a classic even though it occasionally violates strict rules of Kannada grammar.<ref name="hari">Nilakanta Sastri, K.A.

Narasimhacharya, History of Kannada Literature, 1988, Asian Educational Services, 1988, p20</ref>

In Sanskrit, the philosopher Madhvacharya  wrote ''Rigbhshya''  on [[Brahma Sutras|Brahmasutras]] (a logical explanation of Hindu scriptures, the Vedas) as well as many polemical works rebutting the doctrines of other schools of [[Vedas]]. He relied more on the [[Puranic]] literature than the Vedas for logical proof of his philosophy.<ref name="sutra">Nilakanta Sastri, K.A. (1955), ''A History of South India, From Prehistoric times to fall of Vijayanagar'', OUP, (Reprinted 2002), p324,</ref> Another famous writing was ''Rudraprshnabhashya'' by Vidyatirtha.

The modern interest in the Hoysalas is due to their patronage of art and architecture rather than their military conquests. The brisk temple building throughout the kingdom was accomplished despite constant threats from the Pandyas to the south and the Seunas Yadavas to the north. Their architectural style, an offshoot of the Western Chalukya style,<ref name="derived">James Fergusson and Henry Cousens write that the Hoysala style has many features in common with that of the Western Chalukya, {{cite web|title=History of Karnataka-Religion, Literature, Art and Architecture in Hoysala Empire|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm|author=Arthikaje, Mangalore|publisher=1998-2000 OurKarnataka.Com, Inc|work=|accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref> shows distinct [[Indian architecture#Hindu architecture|Dravidian]] influences.

A feature of Hoysala  temple architecture is its attention to exquisite detail and skilled craftmanship. The tower over the temple shrine  (''vimana'') is delicately finished with intricate carvings, showing attention to the ornate and elaborately detailed rather than to a tower form and height.<ref name="Vimana">Percy Brown says though the Hoysala ''vimana'' have rich texture, yet they are formless and lacks structural strength, {{cite web|title=History of Karnataka-Architecture of Hoysala Empire|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm|author=Arthikaje, Mangalore|publisher=1998-2000 OurKarnataka.Com, Inc|work=|accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref> The stellate design of the base of the shrine with its rhythmic projections and recesses is carried through the tower in an orderly succession of decorated tiers.<ref name="tier">This according to Percy Brown is a Hoysala innovation, Suryanath U.

The Chennakesava Temple at Belur (1117), the Hoysaleswara temple at Halebidu (1121), the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura (1279), the temples at Arasikere (1220), [[Amrithapura]] (1196), [[Belavadi]] (1200) and [[Nuggehalli]] (1246) are all notable examples of Hoysala art. While the temples at Belur and Halebidu are the best known because of the beauty of their sculptures, the Hoysala art finds more complete expression in the smaller and  lesser known temples.<ref name="convey">Gerard Foekema says that its the smaller Hoysala temples like the ones at Somanathapura, Javagal,  and Nuggehalli that really convey the full meaning of Hoysala architecture, {{cite web|title=A Complete Guide to Hoysala Temples, 1996|url=https://www.vedamsbooks.com/no11785.htm|author=Gerard Foekema|publisher=Vedams Books from India, Vedams eBooks (P) Ltd.|work=|accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref> The outer walls of all these temples contain an intricate array of stone sculptures and horizontal friezes (decorative mouldings) that depict the Hindu epics.

Use of the Kannada and Sanskrit languages was extensive in the Hoysala empire. Temples served as local schools where learned Brahmins taught in Sanskrit, while Jain and Buddhist monasteries educated novice monks. Schools of higher learning were called ''Ghatikas''. The local Kannada language was widely used  in the rising number of  devotional movements to express the ecstatic experience of closeness to the deity (''vachanas'' and ''devaranama''). Literary works were written in it on palm leaves which were tied together. While in past centuries Jain works had dominated Kannada literature, Shaiva and early Brahminical works became popular during the Hoysala reign. Writings in Sanskrit included poetry, grammar, lexicon, manuals, rhetoric, commentaries on older works, prose fiction and drama.<ref name="works">The ''Manasollasa'' of king [[Somesvara III]] is an early encyclopedia in Sanskrit, Romila Thapar, ''The Penguin History of Early India, From Origin to 1300 AD'', 2003, Penguin, p393</ref> Inscriptions on stone (''Shilashasana'') and copper plates (''Tamarashasana'') were written in Kannada, Sanskrit or were bilingual. The sections of bilingual inscriptions stating the title, genealogy, origin myths of the king and benedictions were generally done in Sanskrit. Kannada was used to state terms of the grants, including information on the land, its boundaries, the participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues, and witnesses. This  ensured the content was clearly understood by the local people without ambiguity.<ref name=bilingual">However by the 14th century, bilingual inscriptions lost favour and inscriptions became mostly in the local language, Romila Thapar, ''The Penguin History of Early India, From Origin to 1300 AD'', 2003, Penguin, pp 393-95</ref>
