The term '''Anglophone Caribbean''' is used to refer to the independent [[English language|English]]-speaking countries of the [[Caribbean]] region.  Upon a country's full independence from the [[United Kingdom]], '''Anglophone Caribbean''' traditionally becomes the preferred sub-regional term as a replacement to [[British West Indies]].

The independent island-nations that are considered as '''Anglophone Caribbean''' include: 

[[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Bahamas]] (the), [[Barbados]], [[Dominica]] (also [[Antillean Creole|French Creole]] speaking), [[Grenada]], [[Jamaica]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]] (also [[Antillean Creole|French Creole]] speaking), [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

Depending on personal point of view, '''Anglophone Caribbean''' may sometimes also refer to the independent [[English language|English]]-speaking countries considered regionally as "Mainland Caribbean". These include:

*[[Belize]] once known as ''[[British Honduras]]''.
*[[Guyana]] once known as ''[[British Guiana]]''.

The Anglophone Caribbean still make up a composite [[cricket]] team that successfully competes in test matches and one-day internationals. The [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies cricket team]] also includes the [[South America]]n nation of [[Guyana]], as another former British colony.
