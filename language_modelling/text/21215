==Background==
In 2008, at the time of the [[murder]]s, Kimberly Clark Saenz was a 34-year old [[licensed practical nurse]].<ref name="KIMATV">[http://www.kimatv.com/news/national/Nurses-bleach-injection-deaths-trial-begins-141467493.html Nurse's bleach injection deaths trial begins]</ref>  Saenz was married with two young children.  Saenz suffered from [[substance dependence]] and used stolen [[prescription medication]].<ref name="KIMATV" />  Saenz had been fired at least four-times from [[health care]] [[Job (role)|jobs]] and placed  [[disinformation]] on an [[application for employment]] and sought a health care job in violation of the terms of her [[bail]].<ref name="KIMATV" />

==Texas District Court==
On March 31, 2012, in [[Texas District Courts|Texas District Court]] Kimberly Clark Saenz a [[Nursing|nurse]] was found guilty of the 2008 [[murder]]s of five [[kidney]] [[dialysis]] [[patient]]s and injuring five other patients.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/02/justice/texas-bleach-deaths/ CNN: Woman convicted of killing patients with bleach awaits fate]</ref><ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/nurse-convicted-bleach-killings-awaits-fate-16052740 ABC: Ex-Nurse Convicted of Bleach Killings Awaits Fate]</ref>  On April 2, 2012, the [[Angelina County, Texas|Angelina County]] [[jury]] [[Sentence (law)|sentenced]] Saenz to [[Life imprisonment in the United States|life imprisonment]] with no eligibility for [[parole]] and three 20-year sentences for [[aggravated assault]].<ref name="KSLA" />

The five murder victims were: Clara Strange, Thelma Metcalf, Garlin Kelley, Cora Bryant and Opal Few.<ref>[http://lufkindailynews.com/news/local/article_f7afb142-7ad9-11e1-90d7-001a4bcf887a.html Lufkin Daily News: Angelina County jury finds Saenz guilty of killing patients at DaVita by injecting dialysis lines with bleach]</ref>

The two [[witness|eyewitness]] accounts of Linda Hall and Leraline Hamilton confirmed that on April 28, 2008, Saenz drew [[sodium hypochlorite]], commonly known as [[bleach]], into [[syringe]]s and injected the substance into two patients dialysis lines at the dialysis clinic owned by [[DaVita]] in [[Lufkin, Texas]].<ref>[http://lufkindailynews.com/news/local/article_49dde116-7a15-11e1-8719-001a4bcf887a.html Lufkin News: Deliberations to continue today in Saenz murder trial]</ref>

The [[Food and Drug Administration]] prepared a document confirming that samples linked to some victims tested positive for bleach while others showed bleach "may have been present at one time."<ref name="KIMATV" />

Lufkin law enforcement officers testified at the trial that they [[arrest]]ed Saenz for [[public intoxication]] and criminal [[trespass]].<ref name="Age">[http://www.theage.com.au/world/us-nurse-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-over-bleach-deaths-20120403-1w9nf.html#ixzz1rMAiAm36 The Age: US nurse sentenced to life in prison over bleach deaths]</ref>  These incidents related to the [[Domestic violence|domestic disturbances]] with her [[husband]], Mark Kevin Saenz.<ref name="Age" /> The husband had filed for [[divorce]] and had obtained a [[restraining order]] against Saenz in June 2007, just one year before the clinic deaths and illnesses.<ref name="Age" />  

The trial records reflected that prior to working at DaVita, Saenz was fired from [[Woodland Heights, Houston|Woodland Heights hospital]] for stealing [[Demerol]], which was found in her [[handbag]].<ref>[http://lufkindailynews.com/news/local/article_df1a2c38-7d00-11e1-9b9c-0019bb2963f4.html Lufkin Daily News: Jury sentences Saenz to life in prison for killing patients with bleach]</ref>  Saenz was fired from DaVita in April 2008 after the numerous [[death]]s at the clinic.  Saenz nursing licence eventually was suspended.  Saenz then applied to work as a [[receptionist]] in a Lufkin medical office and lied on her job application about previous employment.<ref name="Age" />

At the [[victim impact statement]] portion of the trial the daughter of victim Thelma Metcalf told Saenz, <U+201C>You are nothing more than a [[psychopathic]] serial killer. I hope you burn in [[hell]]<U+201D>.<ref>[http://nurseslabs.com/nurse-sentenced-to-life-for-killing-patients-by-injecting-them-with-bleach/ Nurses Labs: Nurse sentenced to life for killing patients by injecting them with bleach]</ref>

The [[prosecutor]], Clyde Herrington, believed there were more victims than just the ten indicted cases, based on the research of the [[Epidemiology|epidemiologist]] from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].<ref name="Lufkin">[http://lufkindailynews.com/news/local/article_ee34960c-811c-11e1-ba1d-0019bb2963f4.html Lufkin Daily News: The day Kimberly Saenz got caught]</ref>   The epidemiologist statistically connected Saenz to other adverse health events to patients.<ref name="Lufkin" /> Lufkin Police detectives could only obtain [[medical waste]] from two weeks prior to April 28, 2008, so there was inadequate evidence to raise further [[indictment]]s against Saenz in the other incidents.<ref name="Lufkin" />

==Court of Appeal of Texas==
Saenz defence team is planning to file an appeal to the [[Texas Courts of Appeals|Twelfth Court of Appeal of Texas]].<ref>[http://www.kltv.com/story/17311211/sentencing-for-saenz-begins-with-light-shed-on-domestic-issues KLTV: Jury hands down life sentence for Kim Saenz]</ref><ref>[http://lufkindailynews.com/news/local/article_3fca083a-7ecf-11e1-94a7-001a4bcf887a.html Lufkin Daily News: Serial killer Saenz appeals conviction]</ref>
