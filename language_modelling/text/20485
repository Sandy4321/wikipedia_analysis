'''St. Michael and All Angels Church''', in [[Bassett, Southampton]], is an [[Church of England|Anglican]] [[parish church]] which dates from the late 19th century.

==Location==
The church is situated on the eastern side of Bassett Avenue, [[Southampton]], described by Pevsner & Lloyd as "part of the splendid tree-lined route into Southampton from Winchester, London and the north".<ref name = "Coles">{{cite book |title= Southampton's Historic Buildings|last=Coles |first=R.J. |year= 1981|publisher=City of Southampton Society |location= |isbn= |page=10}}</ref>

The church is in the parish of [[North Stoneham]] and [[Bassett, Southampton|Bassett]] and has the largest congregation of the three churches in the parish.<ref name="nsab">{{cite web |url= http://www.nsab.org.uk/st-michael-and-all-angels/ |title=St Michael & All Angels|date= |work= |publisher=The Parish of North Stoneham and Bassett |accessdate=1 September 2012 }}</ref>

==Architecture==

===Exterior===
The church exterior, in plain red stock brick with [[Bath Stone|Monks Park stone]] dressings for the doors and windows, slated roof and small bell-turret on its western gable, is not particularly impressive; but with its concrete vaulted roof supported on stone ribs, [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] and Lloyd, in their ''[[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Buildings of England]]: Hampshire and the Isle of Wight'', considered that it has "an intriguing and distinguished design internally".<ref name = "Coles"/>

===Interior===
The church has a [[nave]] with  four broad rib-vaulted bays separated from the [[chancel]] by a [[rood-screen]] surmounted by a carving depicting the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/markcharter/3910204851/ |title= The depiction of the Crucifixion on top of the screen|first=Mark|last=Charter |date= 11 September 2009 |work= |publisher= [[Flickr]]|accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>

The  east window, depicting Christ, flanked by the archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/markcharter/3918627735/ |title= The east window |first=Mark|last=Charter |date= 11 September 2009 |work= |publisher= [[Flickr]]|accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>  was the first [[stained-glass]] window by [[Frank O. Salisbury]].<ref name ="Mann55"/>

The west window<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hampshirechurchwindows.co.uk/churches/bas2x.JPG |title= St. Michael defeating Satan|first=|last=|date=  |work= |publisher=www.hampshirechurchwindows.co.uk|accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref> was given in 1962, by Hector Young an ex-Mayor of Southampton, in memory of his wife Ethel who was killed in the [[Southampton Blitz|Blitz]] in September 1940. The window, showing the Archangel Michael defeating [[Satan]], was designed by [[Francis Skeat]].<ref name ="Mann55"/>

==History==

===Parish===
The original parish of [[North Stoneham]] can be traced back to the early ninth century when it was known as "Stonam Abbatis" or "Abbots Stoneham" and was attached to [[Hyde Abbey]] at [[Winchester]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southernlife.org.uk/nstonham.htm|title=North Stoneham  |first=  |last= |date=   |page= |work=Hampshire Villages|publisher=Southern Life|accessdate=25 November 2009 }}</ref> At this time, the parish extended from the [[River Itchen, Hampshire|River Itchen]] in the east towards [[Chilworth, Hampshire|Chilworth]] and [[Bassett Green]] in the west with its neighbouring parish, [[South Stoneham]], to the south and east. After the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] in the 1540s, the manor was acquired by [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Thomas Wriothesley]], [[Earl of Southampton]]. In 1599, the Wriothesley family sold the estate to [[Thomas Fleming (judge)|Sir Thomas Fleming]], whose descendants held the [[advowson]] until 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northstoneham.org.uk/park/index.html|title=North Stoneham Park: Introduction |first=  |last= |date= 2008<U+2013>2009  |page= |work=North Stoneham Park|accessdate=25 November 2009 }}</ref>

Until the late nineteenth century, Bassett was part of the parish of North Stoneham, with the rector of [[St. Nicolas' Church, North Stoneham|St. Nicolas' Church]] serving the needs of the entire parish. Revd. Elliott Kenworthy-Browne, the rector of North Stoneham from 1886 to 1912, would often walk over 10 miles a day to meet the needs of his parishioners.<ref name ="Mann55">{{cite book |title= Book of the Stonehams|last= Mann|first= John Edgar |year= 2002|publisher= Halsgrove |location= Tiverton |isbn= 1-84114-213-1|pages=54<U+2013>55}}</ref>

By the mid-1880s, Bassett had grown with many substantial villas occupied by the middle classes; despite having the appearance of a well-to-do suburb of Southampton, Revd. Kenworthy-Browne observed that three-quarters of the population of 800 were poor, chiefly mechanics and labourers.<ref name ="Mann55"/>

The parish has since been renamed '''North Stoneham and Bassett''', and encompasses North Stoneham, the whole of Bassett, the portion of Bassett Green north of Bassett Green Road, and the portion of Chilworth within the M3/M27 triangle. The parish also covers [[Southampton Airport]].<ref>[http://www.achurchnearyou.com/north-stoneham-st-michael-all-angels-bassett/ The Church of England, Parish of North Stoneham & Bassett]</ref>

===Church===
When Mr. Kenworthy-Browne came to North Stoneham in 1886, mission services were held in a small coach-house close to the Redhill brickyards. Later, in 1888, a mission room in Winchester Road was opened.<ref name ="Mann55"/>

A legacy in the will of John Brown Willis Fleming of [[Stoneham Park]], left the plot of land on Bassett Avenue on which the new church was to be built.<ref name ="Mann55"/> The new church was designed by [[Edward Prioleau Warren]], with the [[foundation stone]] being laid by Violet Fleming on 29 September 1897.<ref name ="Mann55"/> The church was built in two stages as the money ran out. Construction was completed in May 1910 by the contractors Messrs. Holloway Bros. of London, the total cost being <U+00A3>4,139.<ref name = "Coles"/> When completed, it was regarded as a quite outstanding example of its kind, and attracted visitors from as far away as America.<ref name = "Coles"/>
 
By 1934, the church needed to be extended to include an assembly room (currently used as the choir vestry). In 1937 a new altar with oak panelled [[reredos]] was added.

In 1962, the church was classified as Grade B status, but in December 1969 this was revised to "[[Listed building|Grade II listed]]".<ref name ="EHL">{{cite web |url= http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=135710|title=English Heritage listing for the church|work=Images of England  |publisher=[[English Heritage]]|year= 2007|accessdate=30 November 2009 }}</ref>

In 1980, work began on a <U+00A3>13,000 programme of re-roofing and protection of the brickwork from penetration by damp.<ref name = "Coles"/>

In 2011 the Victorian church pews were removed and replaced by a more flexible and comfortable system of chairs.

===Clergy===
The Parish Rector at the time of the consecration of St Michael's in 1911 was Elliot Kenworthy-Browne. The Reverend Stephen Holmes was invested as the current Priest-in-Charge by The Right Reverend The Lord [[Bishop of Winchester]], [[Michael Scott-Joynt]], on 16 January 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bassettparish.hampshire.org.uk/newsevents.html|title=Licensing of Stephen Holmes|date=21 December 2009 |work= |publisher=The Parish of North Stoneham and Bassett, Southampton |accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref> A new [[motet]], "''The Spirit of the Lord God is upon thee''", was composed by [[Roger Steptoe]] specially for the occasion.<ref>{{cite web|title=A new Motet for Southampton|first=  |last=  |publisher=[[Roger Steptoe]] |date= 1 October 2009 |url=http://www.rogersteptoe.com/works/choral.shtml|accessdate=1 September 2012 }}</ref> Rev'd Holmes was previously Vicar of St. Luke's, Bournemouth. He is assisted by an assistant curate, a NSM, and four Lay Readers. Together, they share the ministry to the three churches of the Parish: St. Michael and All Angels, [[St. Nicolas' Church, North Stoneham|St. Nicolas]] and All Saints.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nsab.org.uk/team/|title=Ministry Team|date= |work= |publisher=The Parish of North Stoneham and Bassett |accessdate=1 September 2012 }}</ref>

==Worship & Music==
St Michael & All Angel's Church has a middle-to-high, strongly [[Eucharistic]] style of worship. Sunday services are at 8am ([[Book of Common Prayer|BCP]] Holy Communion) and 10am ([[Common Worship|CW]] Sung Eucharist), with [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Choral Evensong]] on the 2nd & 4th Sundays at 6.30pm. There is a midweek Eucharist at 9.30am on Thursdays.<ref name="nsab" />

===Choir===
St. Michael's has long enjoyed a strong choral tradition, which continues to the present day. The main choir is the all-age Senior Choir which sings the standard 'cathedral repertoire'. It supports the worship at the Sunday morning Eucharist and sings [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Choral Evensong]] twice a month. The choir regularly sings at both [[Winchester Cathedral]] and [[Chichester Cathedral]] to cover whilst the respective cathedral choirs are on holiday. It also travels further afield each August for a longer residence at a cathedral.<ref>{{cite web|title=Senior Choir|url=http://www.nsab.org.uk/music/senior-choir.html|work=|publisher=The Parish of North Stoneham and Bassett|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>

The church also has a Junior Choir for 7 to 16-year-olds, which joins the Senior Choir at the All-Age Eucharist on the first Sunday of the month. The choir uses the [[RSCM]] Voice for Life training scheme to aid the development of the singers. In addition to singing, the choir also has regular social trips.<ref>{{cite web|title=Junior Choir|url=http://www.nsab.org.uk/music-at-st-michaels/junior-choir.html|work=|publisher=The Parish of North Stoneham and Bassett|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>

===Organ===
The organ was built by [[Rushworth and Dreaper]] in 1937, and is a fine example of a four rank extension instrument. It is totally enclosed in two expression chambers on the north side of the choir.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Organ|url=http://www.nsab.org.uk/music-at-st-michaels/the-organ.html|work=|publisher=The Parish of North Stoneham and Bassett|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> The organ's four ranks consist of an Open Diapaison (A), Lieblich Gedact (B), Salicional (C) & Trumpet (D), which are used to create 25 speaking stops over two manuals and pedals. Ranks A&B (largely used on the Great) are within one of the enclosed boxes, and ranks C&D (largely used by the Swell) are within the second box. The specification can be found on the [http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=N11632 National Pipe Organ Register].<ref>[http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=N11632 National Pipe Organ Register]</ref> The organ was refurbished in 2011 by Griffiths & Co (Organ Builders) Ltd.
