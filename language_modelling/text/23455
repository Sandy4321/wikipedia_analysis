'''Christian apologetics''' ({{lang-el|<U+1F00><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03B3><U+03AF><U+03B1>}}, "verbal defence, speech in defence")<ref>{{cite web|title=<U+1F00><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03B3><U+03AF><U+03B1>|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G627|work=Blue Letter Bible-Lexicon|accessdate=7 May 2012|unused_data=<!-- Replace with BDAG when possible -->}}</ref> is a field of [[Christian theology]] which aims to present a [[reason|rational]] basis for the [[Christianity|Christian faith]], defending the faith against objections.  Christian [[apologetics]] has taken many forms over the centuries, starting with [[Paul the Apostle]] in the [[Early Christianity|early church]] and [[Patristic]] writers such as [[Origen]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Justin Martyr]] and [[Tertullian]], then continuing with writers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Anselm of Canterbury]] during [[Scholasticism]], [[Blaise Pascal]] before and during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], in the modern period through the efforts of many authors such as [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[C. S. Lewis]] and in contemporary times through the work of figures such as [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[William Lane Craig]].  Apologists have based their defense of Christianity on historical evidence, philosophical arguments, scientific investigation and arguments from other disciplines.  '''Christian [[polemic]]''' is a branch of apologetics aimed at criticizing or attacking other belief systems, e. g. the [[Disputation of Barcelona]] at the royal palace of King [[James I of Aragon]] (July 20<U+2013>24, 1263).<ref>{{cite book|last=Kahlos|first=Maijastina|title=Debate and Dialogue : Christian and Pagan Cultures c. 360-430|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot|isbn=0-7546-5713-2|pages=7<U+2013>9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ernestine|first=van der Wall|title=Religious Polemics in Context|year=2004|publisher=Royal Van Gorcum|location=Assen|isbn=90-232-4133-9|editor=T L Hettema and A van der Kooij|chapter=Ways of Polemicizing: The Power of Tradition in Christian Polemics}}</ref>

==Terminology and origin==
The Greek ''[[apologia]]'' (<U+1F00><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03B3><U+03AF><U+03B1>, from <U+1F00><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03B3><U+03AD><U+03BF><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03B9>, ''apologeomai'', "speak in return, defend oneself") was a formal defense, either in response to prosecution in a court of law or by extension as a literary mode.  The defense of [[Socrates]] as presented by [[Apology (Plato)|Plato]] and [[Apology (Xenophon)|Xenophon]] was an ''apologia'' against charges of "corrupting the young, and <U+2026> not believing in the gods in whom the city believes, but in other [[daemon (classical mythology)|''daimonia'']] that are novel".<ref>Plato, ''Apology'' 24b; compared to Christian apologetics by Anders-Christian Jacobsen, "Apologetics and Apologies<U+2014>Some Definitions," in ''Continuity and Discontinuity in Early Christian Apologetics'' (Peter Lang, 2009), p. 14.</ref> The use of the literary form in early Christian discourse is an example of the integration of educated Christians into the cultural life of the [[Roman Empire]], particularly during the [[Little Peace of the Church|"little peace" of the 3rd century]],<ref>Kevin Butcher, ''Roman Syria and the Near East'' (Getty Publications, 2003) p. 378.</ref> and of their participation in the Greek intellectual movement broadly known as the [[Second Sophistic]].<ref>Graham Anderson,  ''The Second Sophistic: A Cultural Phenomenon in the Roman Empire'' (Routledge, 1993, 2003), p. 203.</ref> The Christian apologists of the early Church did not reject [[Greek philosophy]], but attempted to show the positive value of Christianity in dynamic relation to the Greek rationalist tradition.<ref>Jacobsen, "Apologetics and Apologies,'' p. 6.</ref> Christianity, however, privileged [[divine revelation]] above human [[reason]] and apologetic literature often maintains a tension between the two.<ref>Mark Edwards, Martin Goodman, Simon Price and Christopher Rowland, introduction to ''Apologetics in the Roman Empire : Pagans, Jews, and Christians'' (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2002), pp. 10<U+2013>11.</ref>

In the 2nd century, apologetics was both a defense and an explanation of Christianity,<ref>Jacobsen, "Apologetics and Apologies,'' p. 8.</ref> addressed to those who had attacked it, but also to those yet to form an opinion, such as [[Roman emperor|emperors]] and other authority figures, or potential converts.<ref>Jacobsen, "Apologetics and Apologies,'' p. 14.</ref> The earliest [[Acts of the Martyrs|martyr narrative]] has the spokesman for the persecuted present a defense in the apologetic mode: Christianity was a rational religion that worshipped only God as "the supreme ruler of the cosmos", and although Christians were law-abiding citizens willing to honor the emperor, their belief in a single divinity prevented them from taking the loyalty oaths that acknowledged the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|emperor's ''Genius'' or divine aspect]].<ref>Maureen A. Tillby, "North Africa", in ''Cambridge History of Christianity: Origins to Constantine'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), vol. 1, p. 388, citing the ''[[Scillitan Martyrs|Martyrum Scillitanorum Acta]]''.</ref> The apologetic [[historiography]] in the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'' presented Christianity as a religious movement at home within the Roman Empire and no threat to it, and was a model for the first major [[church history|historian of the Church]], [[Eusebius]].<ref>Margaret M. Mitchell, "Gentile Christianity," p. 107, and "Emergence of the Written Record" p. 193, in ''Cambridge History of Christianity'', vol. 1.</ref> Apologetics might also be directed toward insiders, helping Christians already within the community explain their beliefs and justify their position.<ref>Jacobsen, "Apologetics and Apologies,'' p. 14.</ref> [[Origen]]'s apologetic ''[[Celsus|Contra Celsum]]'', for instance, took on the arguments of a critic who had been dead for decades, but was intended to address vacillating Christians who might lack immediate answers to the kinds of questions he had raised. Apologetic literature was thus an important medium for the formation of early Christian identity.<ref>Jacobsen, "Apologetics and Apologies,'' p. 14 ''et passim''.</ref>

In addition to Origen and Tertullian, early Christian apologists include [[Justin Martyr]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], and the author of the [[Epistle to Diognetus]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Dulles|first=Avery Robert Cardinal|title=A History of Apologetics|year=2005|publisher=Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=0898709334|pages=31<U+2013>42}}</ref> [[Augustine of Hippo]] was a significant apologist of the [[Patristics|Patristic]] era.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dulles|first=Avery Robert Cardinal|title=A History of Apologetics|year=2005|publisher=Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=0898709334}}</ref>

===Christian polemics===
In its strictest sense, an ''apologia'' is a defense against a real prior attack or an imaginated prior one: Christian apologetics would arise from anti-Christian polemic or [[Antisemitism and the New Testament|NT anti-semitism]]. Christian polemic is an attack against other belief systems, and not framed as a direct rebuttal of criticism. In a mode similar to polemic are treatises that attack or argue against Christian beliefs regarded as [[heresy|heretical]].<ref>Jacobsen, "Apologetics and Apologies,'' pp. 5, 17.</ref> In practice, apologetics may veer into polemic.<ref>Simon Price, "Latin Christian Apologetics: Minucius Felix, Tertullian, and Cyprian," in ''Apologetics in the Roman Empire'', pp. 106<U+2013>107. pp. 16<U+2013>17, 22; p. 32, note 41.</ref> [[Tertullian]], called a "master of the apologetic genre", was nevertheless inclined toward counter-attack, minimizing common ground between Romans and Christians.<ref>Adolf Martin Ritter, "Church and State up to c. 300 CE", in ''Cambridge History of Christianity'', vol. 1, pp. 531<U+2013>532.</ref> In the forced [[Disputation]] of [[Barcelona]] (1263) at the royal palace of King [[James I of Aragon]], the convert from [[Judaism]] to [[Christianity]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Friar]] [[Pablo Christiani]], failed to prove the truth of Christianity from the [[Torah]], [[Talmud]] and other [[rabbinical writings]]. His adversary was the leading medieval Jewish scholar, [[physician]], [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[Kabbalah|kabbalist]] and [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|biblical commentator]], [[Rabbi]] Moshe ben Nahman Gerondi ([[Nachmanides]] or [[Ramban]]). Nachmanides hinted that the prophecies of the [[Messianic Age]], universal peace and justice, had not yet been fulfilled by Jesus. He also argued that Pablo Christiani's polemics were per-se false apologetics, because Judaism would not allude that man-God Jesus was Messiah while, at the same time, explicitly opposing the idea of the divinety of the Messiah as such:
<blockquote>
"Does he mean to say that the sages of the Talmud believed in Jesus as the messiah and believed that he is both human and divine, as held by the Christians? However, it is well known that the incident of Jesus took place during the period of the Second Temple. He was born and killed prior to the destruction of the Temple, while the sages of the Talmud, like R. Akiba and his associates, followed this destruction. Those who compiled the Mishnah, Rabbi and R. Nathan, lived many years after the destruction. All the more so R. Ashi who compiled the Talmud, who lived about four hundred years after the destruction. If these sages believed that Jesus was the messiah and that his faith and religion were true and if they wrote these things from which Friar Paul intends to prove this, then how did they remain in the Jewish faith and in their former practice? For they were Jews, remained in the Jewish faith all their lives, and died Jews - they and their children and their students who heard their teachings. Why did they not convert and turn to the faith of Jesus, as Friar Paul did? ... If these sages believed in Jesus and in his faith, how is it that they did not do as Friar Paul, who understands their teachings better than they themselves do?"<ref name=stanford>[http://medspains.stanford.edu/demo/barcelona/disputation.html The Disputation of Barcelona (1263)]. Report of Moses Nahmanides, translated from Hebrew, and Anonymous Report, translated from Latin. (medspains.stanford.edu)</ref>
</blockquote> Today this kind of Christian polemics against the Jews has its reverberation in the light of organized [[evangelism|evangelical]] [[Conversion to Christianity|conversion]] of [[Jew]]s to [[Christianity]],<ref name=singerDebate>{{cite web|last=Singer|first=Rabbi Tovia|title=The Disputation - Nachmanides Debates Before King James of Aragon|url=http://www.outreachjudaism.org/store/Product/Details/1|work=Outreach Judaism|publisher=outreachjudaism.org|accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> and Jewish counter-missionary initiatives.<ref name="singer lets get biblical">{{cite web|last=Singer|first=Rabbi Tovia|title=Let's get Biblical - Rabbi Singer answeres Christian Questions|url=http://www.outreachjudaism.org/FAQ|work=Judaism's Response to Christian Missionaries|publisher=outreachjudaism.org|accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref><ref name=debateMizrahi>{{cite web|last=Mizrachi|first=Rabbi Yosef|title=The Debate <U+2013> Judaism vs Christianity|url=http://www.divineinformation.com/featured-videos/the-debate-judaism-vs-christianity/|publisher=Divineinformation.com|accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref>

==Biblical basis==
Several biblical passages have historically motivated Christian apologetics. R. C. Sproul, quoting the [[First Epistle of Peter]] ({{bibleref2c|1Peter|3:15|esv|1 Pet3:15}}), writes that "The defense of the faith is not a luxury or intellectual vanity. It is a task appointed by God that you should be able to give a reason for the hope that is in you as you bear witness before the world."<ref>{{cite book|last=Sproul|first=R C|title=Defending Your Faith|year=2009|publisher=Crossway Books|location=Wheaton|isbn=1-4335-0315-8|page=9}}</ref> The verse quoted here reads in full: "but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect."

Another passage sometimes used as a Biblical basis for Christian apologetics is God's entreaty in the [[Book of Isaiah]]: "Come now, let us reason together."{{bibleref2c|Is|1:18}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Geisler|first=Norman L|title=Christian Apologetics|year=1988|publisher=Baker Book House|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=0-8010-3822-7|pages=11<U+2013>12|edition=Paperback}}</ref> Other scriptural passages which have been taken as a basis for Christian apologetics include Psalm 19, which begins "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands,"{{bibleref2c|Ps|19:1}} and [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1, which reads "For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities<U+2014>his eternal power and divine nature<U+2014>have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse."{{bibleref2c|Rom|1:20}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Owen|title=Reason and Worldviews|year=2008|publisher=University Press of America|location=Plymouth, U.K.|isbn=0-7618-4038-9|page=2}}</ref> Some scholars regard apologetics as a distinct [[literary genre]] exhibiting commonalities of style and form, content, and strategies of [[argumentation]]. Others view it primarily as a form of [[discourse]] characterized by its [[Tone (literature)|tone]] and purpose.<ref>Jacobsen, "Apologetics and Apologies,'' pp. 19<U+2013>20.</ref>

==History==
[[Thomas Aquinas]], an influential Catholic philosopher, presented five arguments for God's existence in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', while his ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'' was a major apologetic work.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dulles|first=Avery Robert Cardinal|title=A History of Apologetics|year=2005|publisher=Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=0898709334|pages=120}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Classical Readings in Christian Apologetics|year=1983|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=031045641X|editor=L Russ Bush|page=275}}</ref> [[Blaise Pascal]] outlined an approach to apologetics in his [[Pens<U+00E9>es]]: "Men despise religion; they hate it and fear it is true. To remedy this, we must begin by showing that religion is not contrary to reason; that it is venerable, to inspire respect for it; then we must make it lovable, to make good men hope it is true; finally, we must prove it is true."<ref>{{cite book|last=Pascal|first=Blaise|title= Pens<U+00E9>es|trans_title=Thoughts|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/pascal/pensees.i.html|page=187}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Groothuis|first=Douglas|title=Christian Apologetics|year=2011|publisher=IVP Academic|location=Downers Grove|isbn=0830839356|pages=25<U+2013>31}}</ref>

===Modern apologetics===
Christian apologetics continues in modern times in a wide variety of forms. The Roman Catholics [[G. K. Chesterton]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Chesterton|first=G K|title=The Everlasting Man|year=2008|publisher=Wilder Publications|location=Radford|isbn=160459246X|page=180}}</ref> [[Ronald Knox]], [[Karl Keating]] and [[Scott Hahn|Dr. Scott Hahn]], the Anglican [[C. S. Lewis]] (who popularized the argument now known as [[Lewis's trilemma]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=C S|title=Mere Christianity|year=2001|publisher=HarperSan Francisco|location=San Francisco|isbn=0060652888|pages=54<U+2013>56|edition=HarperCollins|chapter=The Shocking Alternative}}</ref> The evangelical [[Norman Geisler]], the Lutheran [[John Warwick Montgomery]], and the Presbyterian [[Francis Schaeffer]] were among the most prolific Christian apologists in the 20th century, while [[Gordon Clark]] and [[Cornelius Van Til]] started a new school of philosophical apologetics called [[presuppositional apologetics|presuppositionalism]], which is popular in [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] circles. Others include [[Josh McDowell]], [[Ravi Zacharias]], [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], [[Lee Strobel]], [[Hugo Anthony Meynell]], [[Timothy J. Keller]], [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[William Lane Craig]], [[John Lennox]] and [[Peter Kreeft]].

==Varieties==
There are a  variety of Christian apologetic styles and schools of thought. The major types of Christian apologetics include: historical and legal evidentialist apologetics, presuppositional apologetics, philosophical apologetics, prophetic apologetics, doctrinal apologetics, biblical apologetics, moral apologetics, and scientific apologetics. 

===Historical and legal evidentialism===
Various arguments have been put forth by legal scholars such as [[Simon Greenleaf]] and [[John Warwick Montgomery]] and others claiming that Western legal standards argue for the historicity of the resurrection of Christ.<ref>{{cite web|last=Greenleaf|first=Simon|title=Testimony of the Evangelists|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/jesus/greenleaf.html|publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law|accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Montgomery|first=John Warwick|title=Evidence for Faith|year=2004|publisher=Canadian Institute for Law, Theology, and Public Policy|location=Edmonton|isbn=1896363172|url=http://www.mtio.com/articles/bissart1.htm|editor=John Warwick Montgomery|accessdate=8 May 2012|chapter=The Jury Returns: A Juridical Defense of Christianity}}</ref> In addition, legal authorities' opinions regarding the [[resurrection of Christ]] are appealed to.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ankerberg|first=John|title=Could the Evidence Stand-Cross Examination in a Modern Court of Law?|url=http://www.ankerberg.com/Articles/apologetics/AP0302W3.htm|work=The Evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ|publisher=Ankerberg Theological Research Institute|accessdate=8 May 2012|coauthors=John Weldon}}</ref> Christian scholar [[Edwin M.

Sherwin-White states:

{{quote|For Acts, the confirmation of historicity is overwhelming. Yet Acts is, in simple terms and judged externally, no less of a propaganda narrative than the Gospels, liable to similar distortions. But any attempt to reject its basic historicity, even in matters of detail, must now appear absurd. Roman historians have long taken it for granted.... The agnostic type of form-criticism would be much more credible if the compilation of the Gospels were much later in time.... Herodotus enables us to test the tempo of myth-making, [showing that] even two generations are too short a span to allow the mythical tendency to prevail over the hard historic core.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sherwin-White|first=A N|title=Roman Society and Roman Law in the New Testament|year=1963|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=189<U+2013>190}}</ref>}}

===Biblical apologetics===
Biblical apologetics include issues concerned with the authorship and date of biblical books, [[biblical canon]] and [[biblical inerrancy]]. Christian apologists defend and comment on various books of the Bible. Some scholars who have engaged in the defense of biblical inerrancy include [[Robert Dick Wilson]], [[Gleason Archer]], [[Norman Geisler]] and [[R. C. Sproul]]. There are several resources that Christians offer defending inerrancy in regard to specific verses.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Authors defending the reliability of the Gospels include Craig Blomberg in ''The Historical Reliability of the Gospels''<ref>{{cite book|last=Bloomberg|first=Craig|title=The Historical Reliabilty of the Gospels|year=1987|publisher=Inter-Varsity Press|location=Downeres Grove|isbn=0-87784-992-7}}</ref> and  Mark D.

===Philosophical apologetics===
Philosophical apologetics concerns itself primarily with [[arguments for the existence of God]], although they do not exclusively focus on this area. They do not argue for the veracity of Christianity over other religions but merely for the existence of a [[Creator god|Creator]] [[deity]]. Omnipotence and omniscience are inferred in these arguments to greater or lesser degrees: some argue for an interventionist god, some are equally relevant to a [[Deism|Deist]] conception of god. They do not support [[hard polytheism]], but could be used to describe the first god who created many other gods; however, the arguments are only relevant when applied to the first god (the [[Primum movens|First Cause]], [[Actus purus|Pure Act]] and [[Unmoved Mover]]; it is a contradiction ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' to suppose a plurality of "Pure Acts" or "First Causes" or "Unmoved Movers").

These arguments can be grouped into several categories:
# [[Cosmological argument]] - Argues that the existence of the universe demonstrates that God exists. Various primary arguments from cosmology and the nature of causation are often offered to support the cosmological argument.<ref>[http://godevidences.net/space/lawsofscience.php Evidences for God from Space<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/2329 Apologetics Press - "So Long, Eternal Universe; Hello Beginning, Hello End!<U+201D><!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/Area/isd/wanser.asp Keith H. Wanser, physics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
# [[Teleological argument]] - Argues that there is a purposeful design in the world around us, and a design requires a designer. [[Cicero]], [[William Paley]], and [[Michael Behe]] use this argument as well as others.<ref>[http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v22/i2/design.asp A brief history of design<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
# [[Ontological argument]] - Argues that the very concept of God demands that there is an actual existent God.
# [[Argument from morality|Moral Argument]] - Argues that if there are any real objectively valid moral values, then there must be an absolute from which they are derived.<ref>[http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/probe/docs/god-ethi.html Morality Apart From God: Is It Possible?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
# [[Transcendental argument for the existence of God|Transcendental Argument]] - Argues that all our abilities to think and reason require the existence of God.
# [[Presuppositional apologetics|Presuppositional Arguments]] - Argues that the basic beliefs of theists and nontheists require God as a necessary precondition.

Other philosophical arguments include:
* [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s argument that belief in God is properly basic.<ref>[http://www.origins.org/articles/plantinga_intellectualsophistication.html Intellectual Sophistication and Basic Belief in God<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
* [[Pascal's wager]],<ref>[http://www.apologetics.com/default.jsp?bodycontent=/articles/theistic_apologetics/morris-wager.htmlApologetics.com: Challenging Believers to Think and Thinkers to Believe<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> an argument that, given neither theism nor atheism has an evidential advantage, theism is the wiser position.

====Presuppositional apologetics====
{{Main|Presuppositional apologetics}}

Presuppositional apologetics claims that [[presupposition (philosophy)|presuppositions]] are essential to any philosophical position, and that there are no "neutral" assumptions from which a Christian can reason with a non-Christian.<ref name="Presup">{{cite_encyclopedia |author=John M. Frame|url=http://www.frame-poythress.org//frame_articles/2005Presuppositional.htm| title=Presuppositional Apologetics |encyclopedia=New Dictionary of Christian Apologetics |editor=W. C. Campbell-Jack, Gavin J. McGrath, and C. Stephen Evans |publisher=InterVarsity Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8308-2451-9  |accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref> There are two main schools of presuppositional apologetics, that of [[Cornelius Van Til]] (and his students [[Greg Bahnsen]] and [[John Frame (philosopher)|John Frame]]) and that of [[Gordon Haddon Clark]].

Van Til drew upon, but did not always agree with, the work of Dutch [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] philosophers and theologians such as [[D. H. Th. Vollenhoven]], [[Herman Dooyeweerd]], [[Hendrik G. Stoker]], [[Herman Bavinck]], and [[Abraham Kuyper]]. Bahnsen describes Van Til's approach to Christian apologetics as pointing out the difference in ultimate principles between Christians and non-Christians, and then showing that the non-Christian principles reduce to absurdity.<ref>Greg Bahnsen, ''Van Til's Apologetic'', P&R Publishing, 1998, ISBN 0-87552-098-7, pp. 275-77.</ref> In practice this school utilizes what has come to be known as the [[transcendental argument for the existence of God]].

Clark held that the Scriptures constituted the [[axiom]]s of Christian thought, which could not be questioned, though their consistency could be discussed.<ref name="Presup"/> A consequence of this position is that God's existence can never be demonstrated, either by empirical means or by philosophical argument. In ''The Justification of Knowledge'', the Calvinist theologian [[Robert L. Reymond]] argues that believers should not even attempt such proofs.

===Moral apologetics===

Moral apologetics states that real moral obligation is a fact. Catholic apologist [[Peter Kreeft]] said, "We are really, truly, objectively obligated to do good and avoid evil."<ref>{{cite book|last=Kreeft|first=Peter|title=Handbook of Christian Apologetics|year=1994|publisher=Intervarsity Press|location=Downers Grove|isbn=0-8308-1774-3|pages=72}}</ref> In moral apologetics, the arguments for man's sinfulness and man's need for redemption are stressed. Examples of this type of apologetic would be [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]'s sermon "[[Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God]]."<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/e/edwards/sermons/sinners.html Select Sermons | Christian Classics Ethereal Library<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The [[Four Spiritual Laws]] religious tract (Campus Crusade for Christ) would be another example.<ref>[http://www.greatcom.org/laws/ The Four Spiritual Laws - English<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Scientific apologetics===
Many Christians contend that science and the Bible do not contradict each other, and that scientific fact supports Christian apologetics.<ref>Jitse M. van der Meer and Scott Mandelbrote, ''Nature and Scripture in the Abrahamic Religions: Up to 1700'', BRILL, 2009, ISBN 90-04-17191-6, [http://books.google.com/books?id=I--WJ5X-LqYC&pg=PA295 p. 295.]</ref><ref>Kenneth Boa and Robert M.

Several Christian apologists have sought to reconcile Christianity and science in regard to the question of origins. [[Theistic Evolution]] claims that classical religious teachings about God are compatible with the modern scientific understanding about biological evolution and that the Creator God uses the process of evolution. [[Denis Lamoureux]], in ''Evolutionary Creation: A Christian Approach to Evolution'' states that "This view of origins fully embraces both the religious beliefs of biblical Christianity and the scientific theories of cosmological, geological, and biological evolution. It contends that the Creator established and maintains the laws of nature, including the mechanisms of a teleological evolution."<ref>[http://www.ualberta.ca/~dlamoure/evolutionary_creation.pdf Evolutionary creation], [[Denis Lamoureux]]</ref> The most radical example of a Christian-evolutionary synthesis is the work of [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], which was intended as apologetics to the world of science,<ref>Dulles, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Xli4W2pSZpQC&pg=PA297 p. 297 ff.]</ref> but which was later condemned by the Catholic Church.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/arch/dechardin.txt  ''Warning Considering the Writings of Father Teilhard de Chardin''], Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office, June 30, 1962.</ref>

===Creationist apologetics===
{{main|Creationism}}
[[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationists]] believe the Bible teaches that the earth is approximately 6,000 years old, and reject the scientific consensus for the [[age of the Earth]]. Young Earth creationists also engage in Biblical apologetics with regard to various parts of the primordial history in Genesis 1-11 &ndash; such as the long life spans of people such as [[Methuselah]].<ref>[http://www.creationontheweb.com/content/view/805 Living for 900 years - Creation Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CH/CH311.html CH311: Vapor canopy's effect on lifespan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the [[Great Flood (Biblical)|Flood]],<ref>[http://www.icr.org/article/570/ Why Does Nearly Every Culture Have a Tradition of a Global Flood?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/faq/flood.asp Get Answers: Noah's Flood<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and the [[Tower of Babel]]<ref>[http://www.christiananswers.net/q-abr/abr-a021.html Is there archaeological evidence of the Tower of Babel? - ChristianAnswers.Net<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.christiananswers.net/q-abr/confusionoflanguages.html CONFUSION OF LANGUAGES - Is there any reference in early Mesopotamian literature to what happened at the Tower of Babel?]</ref><ref>[http://www.christiancourier.com/articles/140-the-tower-of-babel-legend-or-history The Tower of Babel<U+2014>Legend or History?]</ref> [[Old Earth creationists]] believe it is possible to harmonize the Bible's six-day account of creation with the scientific evidence that the universe is 13.8 billion-years-old<ref>{{cite web

According to ''Psalms 90:4'' and ''2 Peter 3:8'', "a day is as a thousand years and a thousand years is as a day" with God. If the number 1,000 is interpreted as an arbitrarily large number, then the age of the universe and earth can be long periods of time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Other old Earth creationists, such as astrophysicist [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], see each of the six days of creation as being a long, but finite period of time, based on the multiple meanings of the Hebrew word "yom" (day light hours/24 hours/age of time) and other Biblical creation passages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reasons.org/interpreting-genesis/other-creation-passages/response-genesis-and-big-bang |author=Ross, Hugh |coauthors=Endara, Miguel  |title=Response to Genesis and the Big Bang by Gerald Schroeder |publisher=Reasons To Believe |date=31 Dec. 1990 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christian-knowledge.com/forums/genesis-chapter1/day-genesis-t8.html |author=Russell, Ryan |title=Day 1 (Genesis 1:1-5) |publisher=Christian Knowledge |work=Genesis: verse-by-verse Bible Study |accessdate=3 Dec. 2010 }}</ref>

===Experiential apologetics===
Experiential apologetics is a reference to an appeal <U+201C>primarily, if not exclusively, to experience as evidence for Christian faith.<U+201D><ref>{{Cite document |author=Geisler, Normal L. |title=Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics |place=Grand Rapids: Baker Academic |year=1999. |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

As a strength, this view stresses experience that other apologists have not made as explicit, and in the end the concept that the Holy Spirit convinces the heart of truth becomes the central theme of the apologetic argument.<ref>{{Cite document |author=Lewis, Gordon R. |title=Testing Christianity's Truth Claims: Approaches to Christian Apologetics|place=Lanham, MD: University Press of America Inc. |year=1990 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.
