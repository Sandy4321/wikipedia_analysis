'''Michael Avery <U+201C>Mike<U+201D> Ross''' (born August 2, 1961) is an [[United States|American]] politician. He has been a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] since 2001, representing the [[Arkansas's 4th congressional district|4th District]] of [[Arkansas]] ([http://nationalatlas.gov/printable/images/preview/congdist/ar04_109.gif map]). In the [[U.S. Senate election, 2000|2000 election]], he was the only Democrat outside of [[California]] to defeat a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent. In the [[U.S. Congressional election, 2004|2004 election]] and the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2008|2008 election]], the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] did not run a challenger against him, though in 2008 he did face a Green Party candidate. 

==Personal and professional life==
Ross was born in [[Texarkana, Arkansas]], the son of two teachers, and he attended high school in [[Hope, Arkansas]]. He was educated at the [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]], working his way through college as a local radio announcer. Together with his wife, Ross owned a pharmacy in [[Prescott, Arkansas]], which they sold in May 2007. The Ross family has two children and attend the First United Methodist Church of Prescott. 

Before entering the House, Ross served as Chief of staff to then Lieutenant Governor Winston Bryant from 1985 to 1989.  In 1990, Ross was elected to the Arkansas State Senate becoming the legislature's youngest member at that time; he served for ten years until his election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000.

==Congressional career==
Ross is a member of the [[Blue Dog Coalition]], and he considers himself a social [[moderate]] and [[fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservative]]. Ross supports [[stem cell research]] but opposes [[abortion]]. He also is against [[gun control]], and is one of the few Democratic members of Congress to earn an A+ rating from the National Rife Association's Political Victory Fund.<ref>[http://www.ontheissues.org/House/Mike_Ross.htm Mike Ross on the Issues<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?r_id=3492<Project Vote Smart]</ref>

Ross won a narrow victory against incumbent [[Jay Dickey]] in 2000 by portraying himself as a moderate, as is in line with the political tendencies of his district. In contrast, Dickey was seen as a controversial conservative because of his comments on stem cell research and homosexuality. Ross easily defeated Dickey in a 2002 rematch, then ran unopposed in 2004. He picked up an easy victory in the [[United States Senate election, 2006|2006 election]], defeating the similarly named Republican, real estate executive Joe Ross, 75 percent-25 percent.  In  the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2008|2008 election]], Ross had no Republican opponent but did face Hot Springs lawyer and Green Party candidate Joshua Drake, who he beat with a decisive 87% of the vote.

Ross considered running for the position of Democratic Caucus Vice Chairman for the 110th Congress; however, he deferred to incumbent [[John Larson]] after [[Rahm Emanuel]] chose to run for caucus chair, which is the position for which Larson had been running.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillnews.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/110906/deal.html

==The Blue Dogs and health care==
{{POV-section|date=September 2009}}
On June 19, 2009, Ross made clear that he and a group of other fiscally conservative, moderate Democrats, known as Blue Dog Democrats, were increasingly unhappy with the direction that health-care legislation was taking in the House.  They claimed the health care reform bill was being written behind closed doors without their input and that the proposals being consider fall short in reducing costs and increasing efficiency, outlining only a fraction of what will be required to achieve a product that does not add to the deficit.<ref>http://www.house.gov/melancon/BlueDogs/Press%20Releases/2009-%20Blue%20Dog%20Statement%20on%20HCR%20Legislation.pdf</ref> Ross cited, among other things, provisions that major health-care companies also strongly oppose. Ross was the guest of honor at a special "health-care industry reception," one of at least seven fundraisers for the Arkansas lawmaker held by health-care companies or their lobbyists this year, according to publicly available invitations.<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/30/AR2009073004267.html?hpid=topnews</ref> However, according to Ross's [[Federal Election Commission]] Disclosure Report, which every candidate must file quarterly, only eight percent (8%) of his total campaign contributions have come from the health care industry in the last election cycle (2007-8).<ref>http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/cancomsrs/?_08+H0AR04038</ref> 

Ross was thrust into the national spotlight on July 21 when he and a group of seven Blue Dog Democrats on Energy & Commerce bucked their party's leaders and brought the committee mark up process of H.R. 3200, America<U+2019>s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, to a halt.  House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman postponed meeting publicly to discuss the health-care legislation to negotiate with the Blue Dogs, meeting privately with Ross and other members of the so-called Blue Dog Coalition, conservative Democrats who sit on the committee and could join Republicans and vote down a bill they don't like since the panel has 36 Democrats and 23. Republicans.<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/23/AR2009072303300.html?hpid=topnews</ref>

After days of back-to-back meetings and intense negotiations into the night, four of the seven Blue Dog Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, led by Ross, said they resolved their differences with Chairman Henry Waxman of California and were able to force House leadership to agree on several provisions, namely that the full House would not vote on the legislation until at least September so lawmakers would have time to read the bill and listen to constituents. <ref>http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/08/05/ap/preswho/main5217848.shtml</ref>

Other concessions won by Blue Dogs, which drew immediate opposition from liberals in the chamber,<ref>http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2009/07/29/ap6716914.html</ref> would shave about 10 percent from the health care overhaul's $1 trillion, 10-year price tag, in part by limiting subsidies to people who are not insured. The exemption for small businesses would be doubled so that only businesses with payrolls greater than $500,000 a year would be required to offer insurance or pay a tax equivalent to 8 percent of their payroll.

In addition, the government would negotiate rates with health care providers instead of using Medicare rates in the government or "public option" available to those who do not get health insurance through their employers or a government plan.  <ref>http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/07/30/MN1B1913B6.DTL</ref>

President Obama praised the efforts of the Blue Dog Coalition in a statement issued after the agreement was announced:  <U+201C>I'm especially grateful that so many members, including some Blue Dogs on the Energy and Commerce Committee, are working so hard to find common ground. Those efforts are extraordinarily constructive in strengthening this legislation and bringing down its cost,<U+201D> the President said in a statement.<ref>http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2009/07/29/afx6716133.html</ref>
However, some of the concessions to Ross set off a revolt among members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, who said they feared that the public insurance plan was being weakened.  <U+201C>We do not support this,<U+201D> said Representative Lynn Woolsey, Democrat of California, co-chairwoman of the progressive caucus. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s a nonstarter.<U+201D> <ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/30/us/politics/30health.html?scp=8&sq=%22Mike%20Ross%22%20%22robert%20pear%22&st=cse</ref>

==ProPublica investigation==
On September 22, an investigative report co-published by public interest group ProPublica and Politico found that Rep. Ross was paid in the range of $1 million to $1.67 million for a piece of commercial property located in Prescott, Arkansas by USA Drug, a major pharmacy chain.  The report noted that this amount is far in excess of the assessed value of these assets.  In addition, health-care industry organizations have donated in excess of $300,000 to Ross since 2007.<ref>http://www.propublica.org/article/arkansas-rep-sold-family-pharmacy-to-chain-with-stake-in-health-care-922</ref>

Rep. Ross's responded to the article by denying that the substantial profit he garnered shaped his votes in any way.  Furthermore, he noted that he had filed all required disclosure forms reporting his healthy gain.  The ProPublica story made no allegations of this nature, and Ross did not dispute the substance of the story. <ref>http://www.propublica.org/article/rep-mike-ross-responds-ro-propublica-politico-investigation-of-pharmacy-922</ref>
