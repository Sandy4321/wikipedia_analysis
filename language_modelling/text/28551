'''''The 100-Mile Diet: A Year of Local Eating''''' (or '''''Plenty: One Man, One Woman, and a Raucous Year of Eating Locally''''') is a non-fiction book written by Canadian writers Alisa Smith and J. B. MacKinnon. In the book, the authors recount their experiences, including motivations and challenges, on restricting their diet, for one year, to include only foods grown within 100 miles of their residence. Beginning in March 2005, with little preparation the urban couple began only purchasing foods with ingredients they knew were all from within 100 miles. Finding little in grocery stores, they relied on [[farmer's market]]s and visits to local farms. Staples in their diet included [[seafood]], chicken, [[root vegetable]], berries, and [[Maize|corn]]. They lacked cooking oils, rice, and sugar. They preserved foods for use in the winter but ended with extra supplies.

The couple first wrote about the experience in articles for the online magazine ''[[The Tyee]]''. The popularity of the articles led to a book deal. In the book, Smith and MacKinnon each write alternate chapters, 12 in total. The first chapter is written by MacKinnon and focuses on the first month of their experience. They write in the first person as a memoir that explores their own dietary experiences and personal feelings.

In the Canadian market, the book spent five weeks on ''[[Maclean's]]'' nonfiction bestseller list. The book spent 20 weeks on ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'s'' nonfiction bestseller list. The authors won the Roderick Haig-Brown Regional Prize from the British Columbia Booksellers Association for the best contribution to the enjoyment and understanding of British Columbia. The 100-mile diet concept, along with advocates of [[local food]], were covered by media across North America. 

==Background==
Alisa Smith and J. B. MacKinnon's idea of local eating began while visiting their cabin in northern [[British Columbia]] in August 2004.<ref>{{cite news |first = Pamela |last = Irving |title = Worldwide phenomenon began with one simple meal |work = [[Edmonton Journal]] |page = E10 |date = 10 October 2007}}</ref> Their food supplies were nearly exhausted so to feed their dinner guests they scrounged the surrounding land for food. Their dinner of [[Dolly Varden trout]], wild mushrooms, dandelion leaves, apples, sour cherries, and rose hips, along with potatoes and garlic from the garden, so impressed the couple that once back home, in their [[Kitsilano]] apartment in [[Vancouver]], they pursued the idea of eating only local food.<ref name=Murrills>{{cite news |first = Angela |last = Murrills |title = Alisa Smith and J.B. MacKinnon |url = http://www.straight.com/article-86371/alisa-smith-and-j-b-mackinnon |work = [[The Georgia Straight]] |publisher = Vancouver Free Press |date = 19 April 2007 |accessdate = 2008-08-13}}</ref><ref name=Coppard>{{cite news |first = Patricia |last = Coppard |title = Green grow the markets; Kitsilano couple determined to eat only locally produced food find they cannot live by kale alone, and they longed for a bit of bread  |location= Victoria, B.C. |work = [[Times-Colonist (Victoria)|Times-Colonist]] |page = D10 |date = 6 May 2007}}</ref> They eventually decided to try a diet consisting of eating food, for one year, grown within 100 miles of their home. They began the diet symbolically on the first day of spring, March 21.<ref name=Giese>{{cite news |first = Rachel |last = Giese |title = Home cooking: Alisa Smith and J.B.

The couple, both in their 30s, each had experience in writing: Smith as a freelance journalist who had taught non-fiction writing, and MacKinnon as the author of the [[Charles Taylor Prize|award-winning]] historical non-fiction book ''Dead Man in Paradise'' and a past editor of ''[[Adbusters]]'' magazine.<ref name=Simonds>{{cite news |first = Merilyn |last = Simonds |title = Food for thought about what we eat |work = [[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |location = Montreal |date = 5 May 2007 |page = J6}}</ref>

They were over-whelmed by the response, first from other [[locavore]]s and then from local and international news media.<ref>{{cite news |first = Tracy |last = Loew |title = Couple think globally by eating locally |work = [[USA Today]] |url= http://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2006-06-09-100-mile-diet_x.htm |accessdate=2008-08-23 |date = 6 September 2006 |page = D5}}</ref> Eleven articles were published in the ''The Tyee'' series over the year, plus an additional four articles afterwards, between August 2006 and May 2007. They launched an independent website, 100milediet.org, in April 2006 and began writing the book. [[Random House]] published the hardcover version on 12 March 2007 in Canada as ''The 100 Mile Diet: A Year of Local Eating'' and on 24 April in the United States as ''Plenty: One Man, One Woman, and a Raucous Year of Eating Locally''. The [[trade paperback]] was released in Canada by Random House's Vintage Canada imprint on 2 October and in the United States by the [[Three Rivers Press]] imprint on 22 April 2008.

==Content==
The book consists of twelve chapters, plus an Epilogue and an Acknowledgements section at the end. Smith and MacKinnon individually write alternating chapter, each of which covers one month from March 2005 to February 2006. In the first chapter MacKinnon tells how his idea for the 100-mile diet began and Smith agrees to try it for one year. They begin symbolically on the first day of Spring, March 21, and define 'local' as 100-miles, a convenient radius that would include the [[Lower Mainland]], the southern half of [[Vancouver Island]], and [[Whatcom County]] and [[Skagit County]] in [[Washington|Washington State]]. Their exceptions to this rule include meals eaten while traveling, meals prepared by friends, and business lunches. Their initial month was expensive as they scoured grocery stores for whatever they could find. In the second chapter, Smith describes her and MacKinnon as an unwed urban couple in their early thirties with no children and living in a rented apartment. They recount how eating impacted their relationship before and after the diet, the anonymity of prepackaged foods, the traceability of their diet, and the diets of the [[Coast Salish]].

The [[farmers' market]] opens in May and they are able to buy local honey to replace sugar. Seafood from the [[Strait of Georgia]] becomes a staple in their diet. The couple spend August at their cabin in northwestern BC where they fish the [[Skeena River]], pick wild berries, and eat whatever grows in their garden. Back in the Lower Mainland, the September harvest provides them with melons, peppers, eggplant, grapes, and tomatoes. To prepare for winter they preserved corn and tomatoes, made jam from berries, collected herbs from their community garden, and bought many potatoes. 

During the fall, each write on the troubles in their relationship. [[David Beers]], the founder of the ''Tyee'', hosts a 100-mile [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Thanksgiving]] dinner for Smith while MacKinnon was away. In November, during a family emergency, MacKinnon travels to [[Kamloops]] where he suspends his 100-mile diet a few days. They finally find a source of flour when discover a farmer on Vancouver Island who grows his own fruits, vegetables, meats, and flour. In December, Smith travels to [[Edmonton]] where her grandmother feeds her  microwaved pasta which she accepts.

In January they find a restaurant that specializes in local cuisine and, previously vegetarians, they cook and eat beef for the first in years. Working in [[Malawi]], MacKinnon is struck by the contrast between their western diet and that of the poor country's: there is ample food supplies in Malawi but most is exported to Canada and the United States who buy the food they do not require. The couple learn about [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]] and [[Maya cuisine]] while in [[Merida, Mexico]] for a wedding. The book ends with an epilogue, written by both Smith and MacKinnon six months after their one year diet. They make a symbolic journey to [[Bamfield]], within their 100-mile radius, to collect sea water for its salt and prove they could obtain their own salt supply.

==Style and genre==
The book uses a first person memoir style with Smith and MacKinnon taking turns writing each chapter.<ref name=Coppard/><ref name=Wilkins>{{cite news |first = Charles |last = Wilkins |title = Think globally, shop locally, eat really well |work = [[The Globe and Mail]] |location = Toronto |date = 21 April 2007 |page = D1}}</ref> The authors purposely avoided writing a self help book in favour of the memoir style, saying, "We wanted to show readers that process, and how it affected us and let them see it through our eyes."<ref name=Giese/> The topics sometimes go beyond the motivations and challenges of the diet into more personal relationship issues. Prior to writing the book they created a general plan on where the narrative would lead.<ref name=Conner>{{cite news |first = Shawn |last = Conner|title = Year of eating locally |work = [[Vancouver Courier]] |date = 13 April 2007 |page = 41}}</ref> They took turns writing so they could monitor each other's progress.

==Reaction to the diet==
While the concept of only eating locally grown food is not new, the book coincided with the emerging popularity of the [[locavore]] movement and farmer's markets.<ref name=Cooper>{{Cite journal |first=Carolyn |last=Cooper |date= April 2007 |title=100 miles and counting |journal = [[Food in Canada]] |page=7 |volume=67 |issue=3}}</ref><ref name=Roosevelt>{{Cite journal |first=Margot |last=Roosevelt |date= 12 June 2006 |title=The Lure of the 100-Mile Diet |journal = [[Time]] |page=78 |volume = 167 |issue=24 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1200783,00.html |accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref> Media outlets in North America examined the feasibility of only eating food produced locally, local food-themed events, and locavore groups.<ref name=Moore>{{cite news |first =Jacquie |last =Moore |title = Living La Feeda Local: Can Calgarians eat a 100-mile diet? |work = [[Calgary Herald]] |date = 27 July 2007 |page = SW24}}</ref><ref name=Irving>{{cite news |first =Pamela |last =Irving |title = Local couple takes the 100-mile challenge; Discover buying, preparing only locally produced food results in healthier eating |work = [[Edmonton Journal]] |date = 10 October 2007 |page = E10}}</ref><ref name=Cosier>{{Cite journal |first=Susan |last=Cosier |date= September/October 2007 |title=The 100-Mile Diet: The Struggles and Successes of Eating Local Foods |journal = [[E/The Environmental Magazine]] |volume=18 |issue=5}}</ref> During [[World Food Day]] in 2006, playing off the popularity of Smith and MacKinnon's articles in ''The Tyee'', the [[Vancouver City Hall]] held a 100-mile themed breakfast.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |title = Councillors will breakfast close to home in celebration of World Food Day |work = [[The Vancouver Sun]] |date = 13 October 2005 |page = B2}}</ref> Locavore groups have held local-only dinner parties and week-long challenges.<ref name=Burros>{{cite news |first =Martin |last =Burros |title = Preserving Fossil Fuels and Nearby Farmland by Eating Locally |work = The New York Times |date = 25 April  2007 |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/25/dining/25loca.html?pagewanted=all |accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref><ref name=Dumke>{{Cite journal |first=Jennifer |last=Dumke |date= May/June 2007 |title=Eating In the Neighborhood: My 100 Mile Diet |journal = South Dakota Magazine |page=26<U+2014>30 |volume =24 |issue=1 |ISSN=0886-2680}}</ref> Some restaurants and caterers offered 100-mile menus. Some farmers, gardeners, or regional food producers began offering subscription services to deliver produce or urban farming or gardening services. The 100-mile diet spawned many variations to allow for various circumstances and motivations. Examples include the allowance of a few non-local items, like Barbara Kingsolver chose to include spices into her local diet,<ref name=Burros/> or expanding the geographic area to more convenient boundaries, like the economic region, or the entire state or province.<ref name=Roosevelt/> A 'made-in-Manitoba' diet challenge led to a government Manitoba Food Charter recognizing and encouraging local food markets.<ref>{{cite news |first =Laura |last =Rance |title = The 100-mile diet could be worth every step |work = [[Winnipeg Free Press]] |date = 15 September 2007 |page = B9}}</ref>
