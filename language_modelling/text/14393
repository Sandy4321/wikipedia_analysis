==Claims==
The claims central to hexagonal water include:
* "Hexagonal water is composed of six individual molecules of water, held together by common hydrogen bonds."<ref name="aquatechnology"/>
* "biological organisms prefer the six-sided (hexagonal) ring-structure, found naturally in snow water"<ref name="aquatechnology"/>
* "The percentage of hexagonal units appears to depend on a number of factors, including toxin levels, mineral content, motion, and energetic influences"<ref name="frequency"/>
* "Most tap water and bottled water is composed of large water conglomerates that are too big to move freely into the cells. It must be re-structured within the body to penetrate the cells."<ref name="aquatechnology"/>
* "[[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)]] has the ability to measure molecular size and has been recently employed to determine the structure of the water inside the body."<ref name="aquatechnology"/>
* "far infrared energy, magnetic fields, vortices and turbulence&nbsp;... (are used) to create an oxygen-rich, alkaline, energized and uniquely structured Hexagonal Water."<ref name="aquatechnology"/>
* Hexagonal water is associated with aging.<ref name="aquatechnology"/><ref name="frequency"/>
* this kind of water is found in healing springs, such as [[Lourdes water]].<ref name="frequency"/>

==Incompatibilities with science==

The concept of hexagonal water clashes with several established scientific ideas. Although [[water cluster]]s have been observed experimentally they have a very short lifetime: the hydrogen bonds are continually breaking and reforming at timescales shorter than 200 [[femtosecond]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Unified description of temperature-dependent hydrogen-bond rearrangements in liquid water|last=Smith|first=Jared D.|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA|year=2005|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/sabl/2005/October/Hydrogen-bonds-in-liquid-water.pdf|volume=102|issue=40|pages=14171<U+2013>14174|doi=10.1073/pnas.0506899102|coauthors=Christopher D. Cappa, Kevin R. Wilson, Ronald C. Cohen, Phillip L. Geissler, Richard J. Saykally|pmid=16179387|pmc=1242322|bibcode = 2005PNAS..10214171S }}</ref>
This contradicts the hexagonal water model's claim that the particular structure of water consumed is the same structure used by the body. Similarly, the hexagonal water model claims that this particular structure of water "resonates with energetic vibrations of the body to amplify life force".<ref name="alabama"/> Although water molecules strongly absorb energy in the [[infrared]] range of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], there is no scientific evidence that supports the theory that hexagon-shaped water polymers would be created through bombardment of energy of these frequencies.<ref name="alabama"/>

In addition, the hexagonal water model's claim that water's structure can be determined through [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) imaging is inconsistent with the limitations of the method. In laboratory settings, NMR imaging instruments cannot distinguish between pure water, impure water, or urine.<ref name="wired"/>
