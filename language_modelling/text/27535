'''Klub Sportowy G<U+00F3>rnik Konin''' is a Polish [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Konin, Poland|Konin]], [[Poland]].  The club currently competes in the [[IV liga (Poland)|fifth division]].

==History==
===Beginnings and Rise===
Football in [[Konin, Poland|Konin]] can be traced back to the early 20th Century. The current club's predecessors have been active since 1945, after many mergers till 1954 when the ''Ko<U+0142>o Sportowe G<U+00F3>rnik'' was founded, which 3 years later, in 1957 became today's ''Klub Sportowy G<U+00F3>rnik Konin'', its registration is officially recognised as its founding date. The club spent the 1960's, 1970's and 1980's oscillating between the [[voivodeship]]-level leagues and the [[II liga (Poland)|third tier]] of Polish football. In the 1991/92 season G<U+00F3>rnik finally gained the long-awaited promotion to the [[I liga (Poland)|Second Division]] for the first time, despite coming close several times before.<ref>http://gornik.konin.pl/2014/?page_id=276</ref>

===Name change and the 1998 Cup Final===
In 1996/97 the main sponsor of the club, the local [[coal]] [[Coal mine|mine]] "Konin" withdrew its funding, and the club was transferred under the wing of the local [[aluminium]] [[foundry]]. The new owners however made the very unpopular decision to change the club name to '''Aluminium Konin''', despite many fan-protests. The following 1997/98 season was the most successful in its history, however considering the amount of funding the club received and the fact that its ultimate aim was promotion to the [[Ekstraklasa|top tier]], the season was still classed as disappointing.

Even upon reaching the [[Polish Cup]] final did little to please fans, as despite G<U+00F3>rnik being by far the better team, [[Amica Wronki]] won in controversial circumstances, with the help of the referee Sam Kowalczyk so obvious that he was given a 3 month ban, but the [[PZPN]] match observer Alojzy Jarguz inexplicably gave the referee a high note. Impartial observers, such the manager of [[Lech Pozna<U+0144>]] [[Adam Topolski]], chairman of [[Olimpia Pozna<U+0144>]] (a [[Ekstraklasa|top flight]] club at the time) Boles<U+0142>aw Krzy<U+017C>ostaniak, the chief of [[Zawisza Bydgoszcz]] Edward Potok and former G<U+00F3>rnik Konin manager Janusz Bia<U+0142>ek were all highly critical of the match they have witnessed. Over 7000 G<U+00F3>rnik fans were present at [[Stadion Miejski (Pozna<U+0144>)|Bu<U+0142>garska Street Stadium]] in [[Pozna<U+0144>]], additionally supported by local [[Lech Pozna<U+0144>]] fans.<ref>http://gornik.konin.pl/2014/?page_id=1042</ref>

In the aftermath of the match, Ryszard F., known as "Fryzjer", the director of Amica Wronki at the time, was the leader of an organised crime group, [[match-fixing|fixing matches]] all around the country, uncovering a huge [[Football in Poland#Corruption in Polish football|corruption scandal in Polish football]] several years later. He later admitted to fixing the match in his autobiography. The 1998 cup final however was never investigated, with trophy still belogning to the now defunct [[Amica Wronki]] team, and remains a sore point for G<U+00F3>rnik fans to this day.<ref>http://gornik.konin.pl/2014/?page_id=276</ref><ref>http://gornik.konin.pl/2014/?page_id=1042</ref>

===Mismanagement & Scandals===

The following 1998/1999 season was greeted with financial troubles, after the privatisation of the aluminium foundry meant that it was taken over by the company "Impexmetal SA", who decided to withdraw their support for the local football club. The club still finished the first half of the season in 1st place. The owners of the club, the aluminium works also created a complicated structure whereby there was one club, but the reserve teams and junior sides played under a different name, resulting in one club, two boards, and two names, and made each section a separate legal entity. [[Piotr Nowak]] became the chairman of the club, but the then manager Jerzy Kasalik was surprisingly sacked for an unexplained reason, despite their 1st place in the league, and appointed little-known manager Jaros<U+0142>aw Kotas. The team soon started to lose matches at an alarming rate and only just managed to escape relegation, only thanks to their good start.

The 1999/2000 proved to be a disaster. The owners decided to rename the senior team ''KP Konin'', whilst the reserve and junior teams used the old ''Aluminium Konin'' name. The club finished dead last after abysmal performances. It then turned out that the in the second half of the season plans to relocate the team to [[Bydgoszcz]] were put in place, but still to play under the name ''KP Konin''. In the end the relocation never came to fruition, but the team which only amassed 8 points the entire season, was disbanded, with the club management and the chairman [[Piotr Nowak]], who played professional football in the USA on a daily basis at the time, widely held responsible. The reserve team, which that same season was relegated from the [[II liga (Poland)|Third Division]], became the first team, and a season later (2000/2001 season) managed to gain promotion, going straight back up.

Under the lead of Jerzy Kasalik, the team achieved a back-to-back promotion to the [[I liga (Poland)|Second Division]], restoring the clubs place after the first team was disbanded. The success however was short-lived, after in the 2003/04 season the club finished last once again. Following their relegation, many of the Aluminium players were involved in the large [[Football in Poland#Corruption in Polish football|corruption scandal in Polish football]] which shook the country that season, which had a major impact on the club sponsors who all withdrew. This meant that the new club couldn't even afford to play in the then regional [[II liga (Poland)|Third Division]], and the senior team was disbanded.

===New Start===
The only team left was the Aluminium junior team, which played in the local A-klasa, the 6th tier of Polish football. The ambitious team won promotion in 2004/05. In 2006/07, the restructuring of the league by the [[PZPN|Polish FA]] meant that despite winning the [[III liga (Poland)|fourth division]] the club would need a play-off against [[GKS Tychy]] to gain promotion, which they lost. In April 2008, a new sponsor was found [[Avans]], and after 12 years of waiting to drop the very unpopular ''Aluminium'' name the club finally reverted to its historical name ''G<U+00F3>rnik'', initially at first with the one season-long sponsor name in the form of ''KS Avans G<U+00F3>rnik Konin''. The club is still burdened with debts and various managerial problems which were left after the "Aluminium" era.

==Fans==
G<U+00F3>rnik [[ultras|organised fan movement]] started in the late 1980's, and took off in the 90's, however the club was always very popular among locals. The club has had a constant number of loyal supporters regardless of the division the team happened to be in (which varied from local amateur division to nationwide leagues).<ref>http://gornik.konin.pl/2014/?page_id=714</ref>

Their number one enemy has always been fans of [[KKS Kalisz]]. Other strong rivalries have been with [[Legia Che<U+0142>m<U+017C>a]], with an infamous riots between the two hitting major headlines in 2010,<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B--Yx719a8M</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM1qXadIbuY</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGxYOyVWccA</ref><ref>http://www.mmszczecin.pl/blog/entry/221131/G<U+00D3>RNIK+KONIN+-+LEGIA+CHE<U+0141>M<U+017B>A+ZADYMA+ONLINE.html</ref><ref>http://www.pomorska.pl/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100328/PILKA14/506818386</ref> and with [[Amica Wronki]] (now re-founded as [[B<U+0142><U+0119>kitni Wronki]]) due to the 1998 [[Polish Cup]] final shrouded in scandal, although due to vast gap in the league pyramid there has not been many matches with the latter.

Like many teams in the [[Greater Poland]] region, at first G<U+00F3>rnik fans were also fans of the local powerhouse [[Lech Pozna<U+0144>]], and it was Lech fans which were the inspiration and precursors of the fan movement in [[Konin, Poland|Konin]]. Although presently the two sets of fans have no connection with each other, many G<U+00F3>rnik fans still sympathise with Lech. The fans used to have friendly relations in the 90's with fans of [[G<U+00F3>rnik Wa<U+0142>brzych]].<ref>http://gornik.konin.pl/2014/?page_id=927</ref> Fans of [[KP Ostrovia Ostr<U+00F3>w Wielkopolski|Ostrovia Ostr<U+00F3>w Wielkopolski]] are also warmly welcomed, as like G<U+00F3>rnik, also sympathise with Lech and have a strong rivalry with [[KKS Kalisz]]. Presently the fans have friendly relations with fans of [[Gwardia Koszalin]], officially since 18 April 2009.<ref>http://gornik.konin.pl/2014/?page_id=213</ref>
