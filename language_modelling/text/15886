'''Carol Graham''' (born January 29, 1962) is a senior fellow and the [[Charles W. Robinson|Charles Robinson]] Chair at the [[Brookings Institution]], a [[University of Maryland, College Park|College Park]] professor at the [[School of Public Policy]] at the [[University of Maryland]], a research fellow at the [[Institute for the Study of Labor]] (IZA), and the author of numerous books, papers and edited volume chapters. 

Graham has written extensively and is considered an expert on issues including poverty, inequality, insecurity, the political economy of market reforms, subjective well-being, and the economics of happiness. In ''Happiness around the World:  the Paradox of Happy Peasants and Miserable Millionaires'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), Graham explores what we know about the determinants of happiness across and within countries of different development levels, including some counterintuitive and surprising relationships. Her latest book, ''The Pursuit of Happiness: An Economy of Well-Being'', examines what the new science and metrics of well-being can contribute to policy and, in particular, if they can serve as new benchmarks of economic progress.<ref name="Brookings">The Brookings Institution Press</ref>

== ''The Pursuit of Happiness: An Economy of Well-Being'' ==
Carol Graham<U+2019>s most recent book, ''The Pursuit of Happiness: An Economy of Well-Being'', raises the challenges posed by the use of measures of happiness as comparative well-being indicators. Economists are increasingly using happiness surveys to understand the debates on happiness and policy. Carol Graham was a pioneer in the economic study of happiness, and she has been involved from the beginning in discussions about applying this approach to economic policymaking. In this straightforward and accessible book, she discusses just this: <U+201C>the promise<U+2014>and potential pitfalls<U+2014>of delving into the policy realm with happiness research and indicators.<U+201D><ref name="Brookings"/>

<U+201C>Since 1776 ''The Pursuit of Happiness'' has been the great world question. Here, reflecting on modern survey techniques and results, Carol Graham drills deeper. What does happiness mean? For example, is it opportunity for a meaningful life? Or, is it blissful contentment? And why does it vary, as it does, across individuals and around the world? How does the perception of happiness differ in countries as disparate as Cuba, Afghanistan, Japan, and Russia? Carol Graham is opening up a whole new frontier in economic and social policy.<U+201D> <U+2013>[[George Akerlof]], Professor of Economics at UC Berkeley and 2001 Nobel Laureate in Economics
