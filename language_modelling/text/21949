'''The Steppingstone Museum''' is a non-profit educational and cultural institution that focuses on the commercial and cultural aspects of [[United States]] rural life in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is located near the [[Susquehanna River]] in [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford County]], just northwest of [[Havre de Grace, Maryland]].

Today's museum is based on the private collection of J. Edmund Bull, who amassed 7,000 tools and artifacts. The Bull collection was originally displayed at his home, which he dubbed Steppingstone.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Wade |last=Whitlock |title=Steppingstone Museum: Land of Promise Farm, Havre de Grace, Maryland |journal=Wood News Online |issue=11 |date=April 2006 |url=http://www.highlandwoodworking.com/woodnews/april_2006/steppingstone.html |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}</ref> In 1979, the museum relocated to the former Gilman Paul property, an 18th-century stone farm in [[Susquehanna State Park (Maryland)|Susquehanna State Park]], and was expanded to include demonstrative displays of various vocational trades that were commonplace in rural communities of an earlier era.
