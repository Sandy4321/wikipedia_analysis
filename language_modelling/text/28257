'''Troy A. Eid''', a former United States Attorney now in private law practice with Greenberg Traurig LLP [http://gtlaw.com/] in [[Denver]], CO, is the Chair of the Indian Law and Order Commission [http://www.indianlawandordercommission.com/]  This all volunteer blue-ribbon advisory panel was created by the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 to recommend changes to the President and Congress on strengthening public safety on Indian reservations throughout the United States.  Eid, a Republican who was appointed as Colorado<U+2019>s U.S. Attorney by President [[George W. Bush]], was named to the Indian Law and Order Commission by U.S. Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] (D-NV) and unanimously elected Chair by its nine members in April 2011.  He is also an Adjunct Professor of Law at both the [[University of Colorado Law School]] and the [[University of Denver College of Law]], where he teaches civil and criminal law with a focus on energy, natural resources, environmental regulation, and American Indian law.

==Early career==
Troy Eid was born in 1963 in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] to Edward and Sandra Eid.  Edward Eid was an Egyptian who immigrated to the United States in 1957 with just $100.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Troy was raised in [[Wheat Ridge, Colorado|Wheat Ridge]], [[Colorado]] and graduated from [[Stanford University]] in 1986, majoring in Russian Language and Literature.  At Stanford he was a research assistant for then-Associate Professor Condoleezza Rice.  At graduation, Eid was awarded the prestigious John W. Gardner Fellowship, a joint Stanford-University of California at Berkeley award honoring the late John Gardner, the architect of the Great Society under President Lyndon B. Johnson.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Eid was elected editor-in-chief of the student newspaper, ''[[The Stanford Daily]]'', and met his future wife, [[Allison H. Eid|Allison Hartwell]], while standing in line at a dorm cafeteria, where she was working as a food-service worker; she later said: "It was love at first sight in the meal card line."<ref name="RMN0928">Burnett, Sara.

''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', September 28, 2006, News section, pg. 20A.</ref> Eid graduated in 1986 and, along with Hartwell, attended the [[University of Chicago Law School]], where he earned his law degree in 1991.<ref name="RMN0928" /> Eid is admitted to practice [[Law of the United States|law]] in Colorado and the [[Navajo Nation]], and his legal practice has focused on [[Environmental law|environmental]], [[natural resource]]s and federal [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian law]]. He was elected to membership in the [[American Law Institute]],<ref name="PressRelease">[http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/co/press_releases/archive/2006/August06/8_14_06.html "Press Release: Troy A.

"Eid welcomes new challenges; People to Watch '07." ''[[Denver Business Journal]]'', January 8, 2007.</ref> He passed the Navajo Nation bar examination in 2005 and now chairs the Committee on Training for the Navajo Nation Bar Association, which is responsible for legal education and the semi-annual bar exam on the country<U+2019>s largest Indian reservation.

Eid served as a [[law clerk]] to [[Edith Jones]], Chief Judge of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] before entering private law practice in 1992 at [[Holme Roberts & Owen]] in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]].<ref name="DOJBio" />  From 1994 to 1999, Eid served as [[general counsel]] and [[chief operating officer]] of the National Information Infrastructure Testbed, an Internet technology research consortium formed to prototype advanced Internet applications in such areas manufacturing, health care and environmental protection.<ref name="DOJBio" /> In his capacity with the consortium, Eid directed engineering teams in North America, Europe and Asia.<ref name="PressRelease" /> 

==Cabinet of Gov. Bill Owens==
From 1999 to 2003, Eid served in the cabinet of then-[[Governor of Colorado|Colorado Governor]] [[Bill Owens (Colorado politician)|Bill Owens]]. Owens first appointed him chief legal counsel, where he oversaw the appointment of 34 state judges. Eid also served as executive director for the Department of Personnel & Administration, where he was responsible for Colorado's workforce of 70,000.<ref name="DOJBio" /> Within days of the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]], Eid was chosen to head an independent commission reviewing the [[Jefferson County, Colorado|Jefferson County]] law enforcement response.<ref name="RMN0928" /> He also chaired the Colorado State's Board of Ethics, served on more than a dozen state boards during his time in Owens' cabinet<ref name="DOJBio" /> and eventually served as [[chief administrative officer]] for Colorado's $13-billion [[state government]].<ref name="PressRelease" /> Owens described Eid as a model of integrity and uprightness while serving on the cabinet, and said of his work during that time, ""It's a trial by fire, and when you survive it, typically it means you're going to be a very good lawyer."<ref name="RMN0928" /> In recognition of his reforms to the state personnel system, Eid -- who co-chaired a statewide commission with former Colorado Governor [[Richard D. Lamm]] (D) focused on the future of the state workforce -- was awarded the "Outstanding Governmental Official of the Year Award" by both the Denver Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in 2003..<ref name="DOJBio" />

==Appointment to U.S. Attorney==
When Colorado U.S. Attorney [[John Suthers]] was appointed the [[State Attorney General|state's attorney general]] in December 2004, Troy Eid was considered for his replacement, along with [[Larimer County, Colorado|Larimer County]] District Attorney Stu VanMeveren and [[Arapahoe County, Colorado|Arapahoe County]] District Attorney Jim Peters.<ref name="RMN0518">Burnett, Sara.

"U.S. attorney candidate bails, process took 'too long.'" ''[[The Denver Post]]'', January 27, 2006, Denver & The West section pg. B-01.</ref> Eid also withdrew in part because his wife, Allison Eid, was under consideration for the Denver-based [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]]; the appointment would have created a conflict of interest since the U.S. Attorney oversees cases that often end up in the circuit court.<ref name="RMN0330">{{Cite news|last=Sprengelmeyer|first=M.E.|title=Eid again top U.S. attorney candidate|work=[[Rocky Mountain News]]|date=March 30, 2006|page=5A|authorlink=M.E.

Eid insisted the fact that he had been selected for an internal ethics committee at the firm indicated that he didn't "have an Abramoff problem."<ref name="DP0127" />

After withdrawing, Eid announced he would run for an at-large seat on the University of Colorado [[Regents of the University of Colorado|Board of Regents]]. In March 2006, Allison Eid was appointed [[Associate Justice]] on the [[Colorado Supreme Court]], which removed the potential conflict because the U.S. Attorney does not get involved in state court matters. By that time, VanMeveren and Peters had also been removed from consideration for U.S. Attorney. When the [[White House]] asked for three more names, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Wayne Allard]] recommended only William Leone,<ref name="RMN0518" /> who had been serving as acting U.S. Attorney since January 1, 2005.<ref name="PressRelease" /> Leone, however, had been placed on [[Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy|a list of U.S. Attorneys to be fired for political reasons]] by [[Kyle Sampson]], [[Chief of Staff]] to [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Alberto Gonzales]],<ref name="KRWB0517">Taylor, Marisa and Talev, Margaret.

Sprengelmeyer}}</ref>

Eid was appointed to the position by President [[George W. Bush]] on June 9, 2006,<ref name="PressRelease" /> making him the 41st United States Attorney for the state of Colorado and the first [[Arab-American]] ever appointed to serve as a U.S. Attorney.<ref name="DOJBio" /> Eid, who said he was "totally stunned"<ref name="RMN0518" /> by the invitation, was unanimously confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on August 4, 2006. He served as Colorado's chief federal [[prosecutor|criminal prosecutor]] and represented the United States in civil cases where the government was party to a lawsuit.<ref name="PressRelease" /> When Eid started the position with about 2,500 civil and criminal cases among 120 people, which he described as one of the heaviest caseloads outside of Washington, D.C.<ref name="DBJ0108" /> In addition to the cases, Eid said his priorities upon assuming the office were enforcing [[immigration law]]s, cracking down on [[drug trafficking]], and creating a [[cyber-crime]] unit to fight child solicitation and [[child pornography|pornography]]. In his first few weeks on the job, Eid visited with local, state and federal law enforcement and met one-on-one with everybody on his approximately 140-person staff.<ref name="RMN0928" /> The salary was about $142,000 a year.<ref name="RMN0610" />

==Joseph Nacchio trial==
Eid was appointed as the United States Attorney for the District of Coloardo on June 9, 2006.  Among the cases Eid inherited from his predecessor, acting U.S. Attorney Bill Leone, was the ongoing prosecution of [[Joseph Nacchio]], the former [[chairman of the board]] and [[chief executive officer]] of [[Qwest Communications International]] indicted on 42 counts of [[insider trading]]. Nacchio was accused of selling $101&nbsp;million of Qwest stock in the first five months of 2001 despite knowledge from company insider's that Qwest's financial condition was deteriorating. Leone had been lead prosecutor on the Nacchio case since 2002, but several members of the prosecution team had left throughout the years<ref name="RMN0811">Smith, Jeff. "D.C. may take stronger role in Nacchio's case." ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', August 11, 2006, Business section, pg. 4B.</ref> due to infighting that threatened to derail the case. Due to the problems with the Nacchio team and prior failures to achieve convictions against other Qwest employees, [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] officials became concerned about the Denver office's ability to get a conviction and considered taking over the prosecution. Eid persuaded them otherwise in part by hiring [[Cliff Stricklin]],<ref name="RMN0206">Burnett, Sara. [http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/feb/06/nacchio-prosecutor-leaving-federal-post/ "Nacchio prosecutor leaving federal post."] ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', February 6, 2008. Retrieved on September 2, 2008.</ref> who prosecuted the [[Trial of Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling|case]] against former [[Enron]] officials [[Jeffrey Skilling]] and [[Kenneth Lay]] in response to the [[Enron scandal]]. Although Stricklin was difficult to woo following his Enron success, Eid successfully hired Stricklin in August 2006 as First Assistant U.S. Attorney of Colorado and the head prosecutor for the Nacchio case<ref name="DBJ0108" />

The prosecution team, which had about seven months to prepare for trial, also included Justice Department litigator Colleen Conry; Colorado Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Traskos; former tobacco litigation task force prosecutor Leo Wise; and Colorado Assistant U.S. Attorney James Hearty, the only prosecutor who served on Leone's original Qwest team. The prosecutors reportedly got along very well and heeded lessons from previous unsuccessful [[corporate scandal|corporate fraud]], which prompted Stricklin to describe them as "the very best team" he ever worked with.<ref name="RMN0420">Smith, Jeff. "Prosecution lands the big one; A different team of lawyers prevails in 5-year-long case." ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', April 20, 2007, Business section, pg. 4.</ref> The trial began in March 2007 and in April, Nacchio was convicted of 19 of the 42 counts of insider trading. On July 28, he was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to pay a $19&nbsp;million fine and forfeit the $52&nbsp;million he grossed on the illegal sales. Eid described the Nacchio case as the largest insider trading case in United States history; regarding the verdict and sentencing, Eid said, "This is what the American criminal justice system is all about"<ref name="RMN0728">Burnett, Sara. "Six years in prison. $19&nbsp;million in fines, $52&nbsp;million in stock forfeited." ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', July 27, 2007, Business section, pg. 1.</ref> and said, "'Convicted felon Joe Nacchio' has a very nice ring to it."<ref name="RMN0420" />

Nacchio appealed the verdict, arguing that then-[[United States federal judge|federal Judge]] [[Edward Nottingham]] had improperly excluded a defense witness from offering expert evidence during the trial. In a two-to-one decision on March 17, 2008, the Tenth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned all 19 guilty counts and ordered a new trial before a different judge.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/17/technology/reuters-qwest.html?_r=1&scp=2&sq=joe%20nacchio%20overturned&st=cse&oref=slogin "New trial ordered for ex-Qwest chief."] ''[[Reuters]]'', March 17, 2008.

==Operation Central==
Beginning in 2007, Eid oversaw the nationally recognized Operation Central, a successful joint U.S.-Mexican prosecution of criminal trafficking in endangered sea turtles.  A three-year international investigation led to multiple arrests on charges of smuggling the skins of endangered sea turtles and other protected animals for use in making boots, belts and wallets. Eid described as "unprecedented" the cooperation between U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agents and Mexican authorities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Sea turtles are protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, a multilateral treaty of which the U.S., Mexico and 170 other countries are parties.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_6822575#ixzz14Wff656B | work=Denver Post | first=Felisa | last=Cardona | title=5 Held In Smuggling Of Sea-Turtle Skins | date=September 7, 2007}}</ref>

In recognition of the success of Operation Central, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Department of Justice were later awarded the Animal Welfare Institute<U+2019>s prestigious Clark R. Bavin Law Enforcement Award for this multi-year undercover investigation of unlawful international trafficking in sea turtle parts and products. The award was presented by Willem Wijnstekers, Secretary-General of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Operation Central was the largest probe ever of the unlawful commercial exploitation of highly endangered sea turtles <U+2013> all of which are listed under Appendix I of CITES which bans international trade. Operation Central was planned and designed to infiltrate two widely active segments of the black market wildlife trade <U+2013> sea turtle skin and skin products moving illegally from Mexico to the United States and sea turtle shell and shell products being smuggled to the United States from China. The investigation also documented the role of U.S. retailers in the unlawful commercial exploitation of other CITES-listed species (including caimans and lizards) in the exotic boot trade. The government of Mexico coordinated enforcement activities with the Fish and Wildlife Service that also resulted in arrests in Mexico.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The Clark R. Bavin Wildlife Law Enforcement Awards are named in memory of the late Chief of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Office of Law Enforcement, who pioneered the agency's highly effective use of covert investigations and "sting" operations to uncover illegal wildlife trade. The awards have traditionally been presented by the Secretary-General of CITES during meetings of the Conference of the Parties.<ref>http://www.fws.gov/news/newsreleases/showNews.cfm?newsId=637E7B02-F702-F5EB-E034DAA9CD5FDC2D</ref>

==Other U.S. Attorney service==
In August 2008, Troy Eid charged Marc Garold Ramsey, 39, for sending a threatening letter with a white [[Powder (substance)|powdery substance]] to 2008 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] [[presidential nominee]] Senator [[John McCain]].<ref name="WP0823">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/22/AR2008082202814.html "The Trail: McCain Campaign: Colo. Inmate Charged with Powder Mailing."] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', August 23, 2008, pg. A06.</ref> Although the powder was not lethal, Ramsey could face at least five years on charges of knowingly mailing a threat. Later that month, Eid also assessed an alleged [[2008 Barack Obama assassination scare in Denver|assassination plot]] against then-Senator [[Barack Obama]], the Democratic presidential nominee, after alleged plotters Shawn Robert Adolf, Tharin Robert Gartrell and Nathan Johnson were arrested just prior to the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]]. Although the trio were charged with drug and weapon charges, Eid declared that the [[racism|racist]] statements the suspects made following their arrests had not risen to the legal standard that would have allowed the filing of federal charges for threatening a presidential candidate.<ref>Johnson, Kirk and [[Eric Lichtblau|Lichtblau, Eric]]. [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/us/politics/27plot.html?_r=1&scp=2&sq=tharin%20gartrell&st=cse&oref=slogin "Officials see no 'credible threat' to Obama in racist rants."] ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 26, 2008. Retrieved on August 29, 2008.</ref> At an August 26 press conference, Eid dismissed the trio as [[drugs|drug]] [[drug addiction|addicts]] and said the "[[methamphetamine|meth]] heads were not a true threat to the candidate, the Democratic National Convention or the people of Colorado."<ref>Ensslin, John C.; Villa, Judi; and Washington, April M.

Retrieved on August 29, 2008.</ref>

Eid was accused by some of showing a political bias by prosecuting Ramsey without charging Gartrell, Adolf and Johnson, but Eid defended the decision; in a letter responding to the criticism, he wrote, <U+201C>It would have been disgraceful for me or any other prosecutor to charge someone for a crime he didn<U+2019>t commit. ... There was no probable cause to support such a charge. To the extent you challenge my motives or those of the many investigating agents and career prosecutors who all reached this conclusion in this matter, you<U+2019>re mistaken.<U+201D><ref name="CQP0905">Stein, Jeff.

Retrieved on September 7, 2008.</ref> Eid aides admitted, however, that the decision not to charge was at least in part because they did not believe a jury would convict them based on the reliability of Johnson's testimony; Jeffrey Dorschner, Eid's spokesman, said a defense attorney <U+201C>would tear him apart.<U+201D><ref name="CQP0905" />

Eid also focused extensively on Native American issues while serving as Colorado<U+2019>s U.S. Attorney.  He partnered with the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and the Director of its Justice Department, Janelle Doughty, to create a regional program to train tribal, state and local law enforcement officers to enforce federal criminal law on Indian reservations in Southwestern Colorado.  This program later expanded to include officers from more than 35 Indian tribes from 17 states.  Eid<U+2019>s pilot program gained the attention of Senator Byron L. Dorgan, who praised it as a national success story in strengthening criminal justice in Indian Country and used it as the model for the bill<U+2019>s expanded training provisions.<ref>http://indian.senate.gov/upload/Report-111-93.pdf</ref>

==Resignation and Attorney General bid==
With the election of President Barack Obama, Eid was expected to be replaced as U.S. Attorney, as is the custom with a change of presidential administrations. On January 7, 2009, Eid announced he would resign as U.S. Attorney on January 19, the day before President Barack Obama's [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration]], and run for [[Colorado Attorney General]] in 2010. Eid sought to fill the position expected to be vacated by [[John W. Suthers]], who was planning to run for governor or U.S. Senate. However, shortly after Eid's resignation, Suthers announced that he would seek re-election as attorney general rather than run for higher office. In response, Eid dropped plans to run for attorney general, describing Suthers as one of his close friends and claiming, "Challenging John is not part of my equation."<ref name="CBJ0126">Harden, Mark. [http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2009/01/26/daily6.html "Colorado AG Suthers will seek re-election; Eid changes plans."] ''[[Denver Business Journal]],'' January 26, 2009.

==Support for S. 797 Tribal Law and Order Act of 2009==
Eid testified before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in support of S. 797, the Tribal Law and Order Act<ref name="bill797">[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s111-797 S. 797: Tribal Law and Order Act of 2009], Summary and Full Text, Retrieved July 2, 2010</ref> on June 25, 2009. Introduced April 2, 2009, S. 797 is legislation aimed at amending the Indian Law Enforcement Reform Act, the Indian Tribal Justice Technical and Legal Assistance Act of 2000, the [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|Indian Tribal Justice Act]] and the [[Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968]]. A primary goal of S.797 is to improve the prosecution of crimes on Tribal Lands by filling the jurisdictional gap left when federal jurisdiction over tribal lands was removed in 1953 by [[Public Law 280]]. In his testimony, Eid cited examples of the jurisdictional complexity he encountered during his time as U.S. Attorney.<ref name="xscript">Troy Eid, [http://indian.senate.gov/public/_files/TroyEidtestimony.PDF Senate Indian Affairs Committee] transcript, June 25, 2009.</ref>

Eid testified in support of the Tribal Law & Order Act at the invitation of U.S. Senator Byron L. Dorgan.<ref>http://indian.senate.gov/upload/Report-111-93.pdf</ref>  In July 2009, Dorgan wrote Eid:  <U+201C>Your continued dedication to Indian Country after your service to the United States is truly admirable.<U+201D><ref>http://gtlaw.com/People/TroyAEid</ref> Eid also worked extensively to support passage of the legislation.<ref>http://www.gtlaw.com/NewsEvents/Publications/PublishedArticles?find=135616</ref>  When the bill lacked sufficient votes in the U.S. House of Representatives, Eid and former U.S. Attorney Thomas Heffelfinger of Minnesota wrote a joint letter to Republican leaders urging its passage.<ref>http://www.narf.org/nill/resources/TLOA/HeffelfingerandEid.pdf </ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_15661714 | work=Denver Post | first=Troy A. | last=Eid | title=Bringing justice to Indian Country | date=August 3, 2010}}</ref>  In recognition of Eid<U+2019>s efforts, The Denver Post wrote:  <U+201C>Special kudos to former U.S. Attorney Troy Eid, who worked tirelessly to bring justice to tribal lands<U+201D>.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_15642941 | work=Denver Post | title=Finally, some justice on drug sentencing | date=July 31, 2010}}</ref>

The Tribal Law and Order created the nine-member [[Indian Law and Order Commission]], which is responsible for reporting to the President and Congress by July 2012 on legal and policy recommendations to strengthen public safety in and near Indian reservations across the United States.  Eid was appointed to the Commission by U.S. Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] (D-NV) on December 23, 2010 and unanimously elected chair by the commission's members on April 6, 2011.<ref>http://www.mainjustice.com/2011/01/03/bush-u-s-attorney-tapped-for-national-indian-panel/</ref>

He's just someone who jumps in and says, 'I'm going to meet this challenge.'"<ref name="RMN0928" />

==Writings==
Eid wrote the article "Strategic Democracy-Building: How U.S. States Can Help" for ''[[The Washington Quarterly]]'' magazine,<ref name="PressRelease" /> anthologized in the 2003 book, ''Winning Hearts and Minds: Using Soft Power to Undermine Terrorist Networks.'' He also wrote a 2007 article for ''The Federal Lawyer'' entitled "Beyond Oliphant: Strengthening Criminal Justice in Indian Country."<ref name="DOJBio" />

Eid and one of his former students at CU Law School, Carrie Covington Doyle, co-authored an article concluding that the federal criminal justice system in Indian Country illegally discriminates against the rights of Native Americans in violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  Among other things, Eid and Doyle noted that the punishments imposed on Native American offenders, especially juveniles, are systematically harsher than punishments for identical or very similar offenses committed by non-Indians.
