The '''Mediterranean Sea''' is a [[sea]] connected to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] surrounded by the [[Mediterranean region]] and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by [[Europe]] and [[Anatolia]], on the south by [[North Africa]], and on the east by the [[Levant]]. The sea is sometimes considered a part of the Atlantic Ocean, although it is usually identified as a completely separate body of water.

The name Mediterranean is derived from the [[Latin]] ''mediterraneus'', meaning "inland" or "in the middle of the land" (from ''medius'', "middle" and ''terra'', "land"). It covers an approximate area of 2.5 million km<U+00B2> (965,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), but its connection to the Atlantic (the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]) is only {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide. In [[oceanography]], it is sometimes called the ''Eurafrican Mediterranean Sea'' or the ''European Mediterranean Sea'' to distinguish it from [[mediterranean sea (oceanography)|mediterranean seas]] elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ifremer.fr/lobtln/OTHER/ext_abstr_East_Sea_workshop_TLM.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - ext_abstr_East_sea_workshop_TLM.doc|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/headlines/news/article_09_03_19_en.html|title=Researchers predict Mediterranean Sea level rise - Headlines - Research <U+2013> European Commission|publisher=Europa|date=March 19, 2009|accessdate= April 23, 2010}}</ref>

The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}} and the deepest recorded point is {{convert|5267|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the [[Calypso Deep]] in the Ionian Sea.

It was an important route for merchants and travellers of ancient times that allowed for trade and cultural exchange between emergent peoples of the region. The [[history of the Mediterranean region]] is crucial to understanding the origins and development of many modern societies.

==Name==
The term ''Mediterranean'' derives from the [[Latin]] word ''mediterraneus'', meaning "in the middle of earth" or "between lands" (''medi-''; adj. ''medius'', ''-um -a'' "middle, between" + ''terra'' f., "land, earth"): as it is between the continents of Africa, Asia and Europe. The [[Greek language|Greek]] name ''Mesogeios'' (<U+039C><U+03B5><U+03C3><U+03CC><U+03B3><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2>), is similarly from <U+03BC><U+03AD><U+03C3><U+03BF>, "middle" + <U+03B3><U+03B7>, "land, earth").<ref>[http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2366422 entry <U+03BC><U+03B5><U+03C3><U+03CC><U+03B3><U+03B1><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2>] at [[Liddell & Scott]]</ref>

The Mediterranean Sea has historically had several names. For example the Romans commonly called it ''[[Mare Nostrum]]'' (Latin, "Our Sea"), and occasionally ''Mare Internum'' ([[Sallust]], ''Jug.'' 17).

In the [[Bible]], it was primarily known as <U+05D4><U+05D9><U+05DD> <U+05D4><U+05D2><U+05D3><U+05D5><U+05DC> (HaYam HaGadol), the "Great Sea", ([[Book of Numbers|Num.]] 34:6,7; [[Book of Joshua|Josh.]] 1:4, 9:1, 15:47; [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezek.]] 47:10,15,20), or simply "The Sea" ([[1 Kings]] 5:9; ''comp.'' [[1 Macc.]] 14:34, 15:11); however, it has also been called the "Hinder Sea", due to its location on the west coast of the [[Holy Land]], and therefore behind a person facing the east, sometimes translated as "Western Sea", ([[Deuteronomy|Deut.]] 11:24; [[Book of Joel|Joel]] 2:20). Another name was the "Sea of the [[Philistines]]" ([[Book of Exodus|Exod.]] 23:31), from the people occupying a large portion of its shores near the [[Israelites]].

In [[Hebrew language|Modern Hebrew]], it has been called ''HaYam HaTikhon'' ({{Hebrew|<U+05D4><U+05B7><U+05D9><U+05B8><U+05BC><U+05DD> <U+05D4><U+05B7><U+05EA><U+05B4><U+05BC><U+05D9><U+05DB><U+05D5><U+05B9><U+05DF>}}), "the Middle Sea", reflecting the Sea's name in ancient Greek (''Mesogeios''), Latin (''Mare internum'') and modern languages in both Europe and the Middle East (''Mediterranean'', etc.). Simillarly, in [[Arabic language|Modern Arabic]], it is known as ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-Ba<U+1E25>r [al-Abya<U+1E0D>] al-Mutawassi<U+1E6D>}}'' (<span dir="rtl">{{lang|ar|<U+0627><U+0644><U+0628><U+062D><U+0631> [<U+0627><U+0644><U+0623><U+0628><U+064A><U+0636>] <U+0627><U+0644><U+0645><U+062A><U+0648><U+0633><U+0637>}}</span>), "the [White] Medium Sea", while in Islamic and older Arabic literature, it was referenced as ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Ba<U+1E25>r al-R<U+016B>m}}'' ({{lang|ar|<U+0628><U+062D><U+0631> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0631><U+0648><U+0645>}}), or "the Roman/[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Sea." In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], it is known as ''Akdeniz'',<ref>[[<U+00D6>zhan <U+00D6>zt<U+00FC>rk]] claims that in Old Turkish ''ak'' also means "west" and that ''Akdeniz'' hence means "West Sea", while ''Karadeniz'' (Black Sea) means "North Sea".

Several ancient civilizations were located around its shores; thus it has had a major influence on those cultures. It provided routes for trade, colonization and war, and provided food (by fishing and the gathering of other seafood) for numerous communities throughout the ages.<ref>{{cite book|author=David Abulafia|title=''The Great Sea: A Human History of the Mediterranean''|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|year=2011}}</ref>

The sharing of similar climate, geology and access to a common sea led to numerous historical and cultural connections between the ancient and modern societies around the Mediterranean.

Two of the most notable Mediterranean civilizations in [[classical antiquity]] were the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city state]]s and the [[Phoenicia]]ns. When{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} [[Augustus]] founded the [[Roman Empire]], the Mediterranean Sea began to be called ''Mare Nostrum'' (literally:"Our Sea") by the Romans.

[[Darius I of Persia]], who conquered [[Ancient Egypt]], built a canal linking the Mediterranean to the [[Red Sea]]. Darius's canal was wide enough for two [[trireme]]s to pass each other with oars extended, and required four days to traverse.<ref>Rappoport, S. (Doctor of Philosophy, Basel). History of Egypt (undated, early 20th century), Volume 12, Part B, Chapter V: "The Waterways of Egypt", pages 248-257. London: The Grolier Society.</ref>

The western Roman empire collapsed around AD 476. Temporarily the east was again dominant as the [[Byzantine Empire]] formed from the eastern half of the Roman empire. Another power soon arose in the east: [[Islam]]. At its greatest extent, the [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] controlled 75% of the Mediterranean region.

Europe was reviving, however, as more organized and centralized states began to form in the later [[Middle Ages]] after the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]].

[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] power continued to grow, and in 1453, the Byzantine Empire was extinguished with the [[Conquest of Constantinople]]. Ottomans gained control of much of the sea in the 16th century and maintained naval bases in southern France, Algeria and Tunisia. [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Barbarossa]], the famous Ottoman captain is a symbol of this domination with the victory of the [[Battle of Preveza]]. The [[Battle of Djerba]] marked the apex of Ottoman naval domination in the Mediterranean. However, as naval prowess of the European powers grew, they confronted Ottoman expansion in the region when the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] checked the power of the [[Ottoman Navy]]. This was the last naval battle to be fought primarily between [[galley]]s.

The [[Barbary pirates]] of North Africa preyed on Christian shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=5q9zcB3JS40C&pg&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500<U+2013>1800 |author=Robert Davis |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |date= 5 December 2003|accessdate=17 January 2013|isbn=9780333719664}}</ref> According to Robert Davis, from the 16th to 19th century, pirates captured 1 million to 1.25 million Europeans as slaves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_01.shtml |title=British Slaves on the Barbary Coast |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=17 January 2013}}</ref>

The development of oceanic shipping began to affect the entire Mediterranean. Once, all trade from the east had passed through the region, but now the circumnavigation of Africa allowed [[Spice trade|spice]]s and other goods to be imported through the Atlantic ports of western Europe.<ref>C.I.

The Mediterranean Sea is connected to the Atlantic Ocean by the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] in the west and to the [[Sea of Marmara]] and the [[Black Sea]], by the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Bosporus]] respectively, in the east. The Sea of Marmara is often considered a part of the Mediterranean Sea, whereas the Black Sea is generally not. The {{convert|163|km|mi|abbr=on}} long man-made [[Suez Canal]] in the southeast connects the Mediterranean Sea to the [[Red Sea]].

Large islands in the Mediterranean include [[Cyprus]], [[Crete]], [[Euboea]], [[Rhodes]], [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]], [[Chios]], [[Kefalonia]], [[Corfu]], [[Limnos]], [[Samos]], [[Naxos Island|Naxos]] and [[Andros]] in the [[eastern Mediterranean]]; [[Sardinia]], [[Corsica]], [[Sicily]], [[Cres]], [[Krk]], [[Bra<U+010D>]], [[Hvar]], [[Pag (island)|Pag]], [[Kor<U+010D>ula]] and [[Malta Island|Malta]] in the central Mediterranean; and [[Ibiza]], [[Majorca]] and [[Minorca]] (the [[Balearic Islands]]) in the western Mediterranean.

The typical [[Mediterranean climate]] has hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Crops of the region include [[olive]]s, [[grape]]s, [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s, [[tangerine]]s, and [[cork (material)|cork]].

===Extent===
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Mediterranean Sea as follows:<ref name="IHO">{{cite web|url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S23_1953.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=7 February 2010}}</ref>

Stretching from the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] in the West to the entrances to the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Suez Canal]] in the East, the Mediterranean Sea is bounded by the coasts of Europe, Africa and Asia, and is divided into two deep basins:
*Western Basin:
**On the west: A line joining the extremities of [[Cape Trafalgar]] (Spain) and [[Cape Spartel]] (Africa).
**On the northeast: The West Coast of Italy. In the [[Strait of Messina]] a line joining the North extreme of Cape Paci (15<U+00B0>42'E) with Cape Peloro, the East extreme of the Island of [[Sicily]]. The North Coast of Sicily.
** On the east: A line joining Cape Lilibeo the Western point of Sicily ({{coord|37|47|N|12|22|E|display=inline}}), through the Adventure Bank to [[Cape Bon]] (Tunisia).
*Eastern Basin:
**On the west: The Northeastern and Eastern limits of the Western Basin.
**On the northeast: A line joining Kum Kale (26<U+00B0>11'E) and [[Cape Helles]], the Western entrance to the [[Dardanelles]].
**On the southeast: The entrance to the [[Suez Canal]].
**On the east: The coasts of [[Syria]] and [[Palestine]].<!--NOTE: Do not change this to Israel or add Lebanon. This text is a direct quote of the International Hydrographic Organization's definition, which refers to Palestine and omits Lebanon.-->

(It should be noted that the coast referred to as belonging to [[Palestine]] in this document dating to 1953 has been within the internationally recognised borders of the country known as [[Israel]] since 1948. Of the territories administered by the Palestinian Authority, only the [[Gaza Strip]] has a sea coast.)

===Oceanography===
[[File:MEDCURR.GIF|thumb|365px|Predominant surface currents for June]]

Being nearly landlocked affects conditions in the Mediterranean Sea: for instance, [[tide]]s are very limited as a result of the narrow connection with the Atlantic Ocean. The Mediterranean is characterized and immediately recognised by its deep blue colour.

[[Evaporation]] greatly exceeds [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and river runoff in the Mediterranean, a fact that is central to the water circulation within the basin.<ref>{{citation|last=Pinet|first=Paul R.|year=1996|title=Invitation to Oceanography|location=St Paul, Minnesota|publisher =West Publishing Co.|isbn=0-314-06339-0|edition=3rd|page=202}}</ref> Evaporation is especially high in its eastern half, causing the water level to decrease and [[salinity]] to increase eastward.<ref>Pinet 1996, p. 206.</ref> This [[pressure gradient]] pushes relatively cool, low-salinity water from the Atlantic across the basin; it warms and becomes saltier as it travels east, then sinks in the region of the [[Levant]] and circulates westward, to spill over the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].<ref>Pinet 1996, pp. 206<U+2013>207.</ref> Thus, seawater flow is eastward in the Strait's surface waters, and westward below; once in the Atlantic, this chemically distinct Mediterranean Intermediate Water can persist thousands of kilometres away from its source.<ref>Pinet 1996, p. 207.</ref>

===Coastal countries===
[[File:Mediterranean Relief.jpg|thumb|365px|Map of the Mediterranean Sea]]

Twenty-two countries have a coastline on the Mediterranean Sea. They are:
*'''Northern shore''' (from west to east): {{ESP}}, {{FRA}}, {{MCO}}, {{ITA}}, {{SVN}}, {{HRV}}, <br>{{BIH}}, {{MNE}}, {{ALB}}, {{GRC}} and {{TUR}}.
*'''Eastern shore''' (from north to south): {{SYR}}, {{LBN}}, {{ISR}}, [[File:Flag of Palestine.svg|30px|border]] [[State of Palestine|Palestine (limited recognition)]].
*'''Southern shore''' (from west to east): {{MAR}}, {{DZA}}, {{TUN}}, {{LBY}}, {{EGY}}.
*'''Island nations''': {{MLT}}, {{CYP}}.

Several other territories also border the Mediterranean Sea (from west to east): The [[British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]], the Spanish autonomous cities of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] and [[plazas de soberan<U+00ED>a|nearby islands]], and the [[Sovereign Base Areas]] on Cyprus

===Subdivisions===
[[File:Bucht & Stra<U+00DF>e von Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|Africa (right, on horizon) and Europe (left), as seen from Gibraltar.]]
According to the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO), the Mediterranean Sea is subdivided into a number of smaller waterbodies, each with their own designation (from west to east):<ref name="IHO"/>

*the [[Strait of Gibraltar]];
*the [[Alboran Sea]], between Spain and [[Morocco]];
*the [[Balearic Sea]], between mainland Spain and its [[Balearic Islands]];

*the [[Ionian Sea]] between Italy, [[Albania]] and Greece;
*the [[Adriatic Sea]] between Italy, [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Albania]];
*the [[Aegean Sea]] between Greece and Turkey.

====Other seas====
[[File:Amalfi2.JPG|thumb|[[Amalfi]] viewed from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]].]]
Although not recognised by the IHO treaties, there are some other seas whose names have been in common use from the ancient times, or in the present:
*the [[Sea of Sardinia]], between [[Sardinia]] and [[Balearic Islands]], as a part of the [[Balearic Sea]]

[[File:Crisis salina del Messiniense.ogv|thumb|Messinian salinity crisis animation]]
The [[geology|geologic history]] of the Mediterranean is complex. It was involved in the [[tectonic]] break-up and then collision of the [[African Plate|African]] and [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] plates. The [[Messinian Salinity Crisis]] occurred in the late [[Miocene]] (12 million years ago to 5 million years ago) when the Mediterranean dried up. Geologically the Mediterranean is underlain by [[oceanic crust]].

The Mediterranean Sea has an average depth of {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}} and the deepest recorded point is {{convert|5267|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the [[Calypso Deep]] in the [[Ionian Sea]]. The coastline extends for {{convert|46000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. A shallow submarine ridge (the [[Strait of Sicily]]) between the island of [[Sicily]] and the coast of [[Tunisia]] divides the sea in two main subregions (which in turn are divided into subdivisions), the [[Western Mediterranean]] and the [[Eastern Mediterranean]]. The Western Mediterranean covers an area of about 0.85 million&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (0.33 million&nbsp;mi<U+00B2>) and the Eastern Mediterranean about 1.65 million&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (0.64 million&nbsp;mi<U+00B2>). A characteristic of the Mediterranean Sea are submarine [[karst spring]]s or {{lang|hr|''vrulja''}}s, which mainly occur in shallow waters<ref name="LaMoreaux2001">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.si/books?id=sjEoBmfUka0C&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q&f=false |chapter=Geologic/Hydrogeologic Setting and Classification of Springs  |page=57 |title=Springs and Bottled Waters of the World: Ancient History, Source, Occurrence, Quality and Use |first=Philip |last=Elmer LaMoreaux |year=2001 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-61841-6}}</ref> and may also be thermal.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://zgs.zrc-sazu.si/Portals/8/Geografski_obzornik/go_2004_2.pdf|journal=Geografski obzornik|year=2004|volume=51|issue=2|issn=0016-7274|publisher=Association of the Geographical Societies of Slovenia|language=Slovene|first=Jo<U+017E>e|last=<U+017D>umer|title=Odkritje podmorskih termalnih izvirov|trans_title=Discovery of submarine thermal springs|pages=11<U+2013>17}} {{sl icon}}</ref>

===Tectonic evolution===
The [[Geodynamics|geodynamic]] evolution of the Mediterranean Sea was provided by the [[Convergent boundary|convergence]] of European and African plates and several smaller [[List of tectonic plates#Tertiary plates|microplates]]. This process was driven by the differential [[seafloor spreading]] along the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], which led to the closure of the [[Tethys Ocean]] and eventually to the [[Alpine orogeny|Alpine orogenesis]]. However, the Mediterranean also hosts wide extensional [[Structural basin|basins]] and migrating [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] [[Volcanic arc|arcs]], in response to its land-locked configuration.

According to a report published by [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] in 2009, some scientists think that the Mediterranean Sea was mostly filled during a time period of less than two years, in a major flood (the ''[[Zanclean flood]]'') that happened approximately 5.33 million years ago, in which water poured in from the Atlantic Ocean and through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], at a rate three times the current flow of the [[Amazon River]].<ref>[http://phys.org/news179598629.html Mediterranean Sea filled in less than two years: study], AFP, December 9, 2009</ref> However, the sea basins had been filled for many millions of years ''before'' the prior closure of the Strait of Gibraltar.

====Eastern Mediterranean====
In middle [[Miocene]] times, the [[Orogeny|collision]] between the [[Arabian plate|Arabian microplate]] and [[Eurasian plate|Eurasia]] led to the separation between the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys]] and the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] oceans. This process resulted in profound changes in the [[Ocean current|oceanic circulation]] patterns, which shifted global climates towards colder conditions. The [[Hellenic arc]], which has a land-locked configuration, underwent a widespread extension for the last 20 Ma due to a slab roll-back process. In addition, the Hellenic Arc experienced a rapid rotation phase during the [[Pleistocene]], with a counterclockwise component in its eastern portion and a clockwise trend in the western segment.

====Central Mediterranean====
The opening of small oceanic basins of the central Mediterranean follows a [[Oceanic trench|trench]] migration and [[Back-arc basin|back-arc]] opening process that occurred during the last 30 Myr. This phase was characterised by the anticlockwise rotation of the Corsica-Sardinia [[Terrane|block]], which lasted until the Langhian (ca.16 Ma), and was in turn followed by a slab detachment along the northern African margin. Subsequently, a shift of this active extensional deformation led to the opening of the Tyrrenian basin.

====Western Mediterranean====
The Betic-Rif [[mountain belt]]s developed during [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]] times, as Africa and Iberia converged. Tectonic models for its evolution include: rapid motion of [[Alboran]] Domain, [[subduction]] zone and radial extensional collapse caused by convective removal of lithospheric mantle. The development of these intramontane Betic and Rif basins led to the onset of two marine gateways which were progressively closed during the late Miocene by an interplay of tectonic and [[Sea level|glacio-eustatic]] processes.

===Paleoenvironmental analysis===
Its semi-enclosed configuration makes the oceanic gateways critical in controlling circulation and environmental evolution in the Mediterranean Sea. Water circulation patterns are driven by a number of interactive factors, such as climate and bathymetry, which can lead to precipitation of [[evaporites]]. During late Miocene times, a so-called "[[Messinian Salinity Crisis]]" (MSC hereafter) occurred, which was triggered by the closure of the Atlantic gateway. [[Evaporite]]s accumulated in the [[Red Sea|Red Sea Basin]] (late [[Miocene]]), in the Carpatian foredeep (middle Miocene) and in the whole Mediterranean area ([[Messinian]]). An accurate age estimate of the MSC<U+2014>5.96 Ma<U+2014>has recently been astronomically achieved; furthermore, this event seems to have occurred synchronously. The beginning of the MSC is supposed to have been of tectonic origin; however, an astronomical control (eccentricity) might also have been involved. In the Mediterranean basin, [[diatomite]]s are regularly found underneath the [[evaporite]] deposits, thus suggesting (albeit not clearly so far) a connection between their geneses.

The present-day Atlantic gateway, i.e. the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], finds its origin in the early Pliocene. However, two other connections between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea existed in the past: the [[Betic Corridor]] (southern Spain) and the Rifian Corridor (northern [[Morocco]]). The former closed during [[Tortonian]] times, thus providing a "Tortonian Salinity Crisis" well before the MSC; the latter closed about 6 Ma, allowing exchanges in the mammal fauna between Africa and Europe. Nowadays, evaporation is more relevant than the water yield supplied by riverine water and precipitation, so that salinity in the Mediterranean is higher than in the Atlantic. These conditions result in the outflow of warm saline Mediterranean deep water across Gibraltar, which is in turn counterbalanced by an inflow of a less saline surface current of cold oceanic water.

The Mediterranean was once thought to be the remnant of the [[Tethys Ocean]]. It is now known to be a structurally younger ocean basin known as [[Neotethys]]. The Neotethys formed during the Late [[Triassic]] and Early [[Jurassic]] [[rift]]ing of the African and Eurasian [[plate tectonics|plates]].

==Paleoclimate==
Because of its latitudinal position and its land-locked configuration, the Mediterranean is especially sensitive to astronomically induced climatic variations, which are well documented in its sedimentary record. Since the Mediterranean is involved in the deposition of eolian dust from the [[Sahara]] during dry periods, whereas riverine detrital input prevails during wet ones, the Mediterranean marine [[sapropel]]-bearing sequences provide high-resolution climatic information. These data have been employed in reconstructing astronomically calibrated time scales for the last 9 Ma of the Earth's history, helping to constrain the time of past [[Geomagnetic Reversal]]s.<ref>FJ, Hilgen. Astronomical calibration of Gauss to Matuyama sapropels in the Mediterranean and implication for the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale, 104 (1991) 226-244 ''Earth and Planetary Science Letters'', 1991.[http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/geo/2007-0119-200857/hilgen_91_astronomical.pdf]</ref> Furthermore, the exceptional accuracy of these paleoclimatic records have improved our knowledge of the Earth's orbital variations in the past.

==Ecology and biota==
As a result of the drying of the sea during the [[Messinian salinity crisis]],<ref>[[Kenneth J. Hsu|Hsu K.J.]], "When the Mediterranean Dried Up" ''Scientific American'', Vol. '''227''', December 1972, p32</ref> the marine biota of the Mediterranean are derived primarily from the Atlantic Ocean. The North Atlantic is considerably colder and more nutrient-rich than the Mediterranean, and the marine life of the Mediterranean has had to adapt to its differing conditions in the five million years since the basin was reflooded.

The [[Alboran Sea]] is a transition zone between the two seas, containing a mix of Mediterranean and Atlantic species. The Alboran Sea has the largest population of [[Bottlenose Dolphin]]s in the western Mediterranean, is home to the last population of [[harbour porpoise]]s in the Mediterranean, and is the most important feeding grounds for [[Loggerhead Sea Turtle]]s in Europe. The Alboran sea also hosts important commercial fisheries, including [[sardine]]s and [[swordfish]]. The [[Mediterranean monk seal]]s live in the Aegean Sea in Greece. In 2003, the [[World Wildlife Fund]] raised concerns about the widespread [[drift net]] fishing endangering populations of dolphins, turtles, and other marine animals.

====Invasive species====
[[File:Himantura uarnak egypt.jpg|thumb|The [[Reticulate whipray]] is one of the species that colonised the eastern Mediterranean through the [[Suez Canal]].]]

The opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 created the first salt-water passage between the Mediterranean and [[Red Sea]]. The Red Sea is higher than the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], so the canal serves as a tidal [[strait]] that pours Red Sea water into the Mediterranean. The [[Bitter Lakes]], which are hyper-saline natural lakes that form part of the canal, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalized with that of the Red Sea, the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonise the [[Eastern Mediterranean]]. The Red Sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the Atlantic, so the Red Sea species have advantages over Atlantic species in the salty and nutrient-poor [[Eastern Mediterranean]]. Accordingly, Red Sea species invade the Mediterranean biota, and not vice versa; this phenomenon is known as the [[Lessepsian migration]] (after [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], the French engineer) or [[Erythrean invasion]]. The construction of the [[Aswan High Dam]] across the [[Nile River]] in the 1960s reduced the inflow of freshwater and nutrient-rich [[silt]] from the Nile into the Eastern Mediterranean, making conditions there even more like the Red Sea and worsening the impact of the [[invasive species]].

[[Invasive species]] have become a major component of the Mediterranean ecosystem and have serious impacts on the Mediterranean ecology, endangering many local and [[endemism|endemic]] Mediterranean species. A first look at some groups of exotic species show that more than 70% of the non-indigenous decapods and about 63% of the exotic fishes occurring in the Mediterranean are of Indo Pacific origin,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.issg.org/infpaper_invasive.pdf|title=IUCN Guidelines for the Prevention of Biodiversity Loss Caused by Alien Invasive Species|accessdate= 2009-08-11|year=2000|publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> [[introduced species|introduced]] into the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal. This makes the Canal as the first pathway of arrival of "[[Introduced species|alien]]" species into the Mediterranean. The impacts of some lessepsian species have proven to be considerable mainly in the Levantine basin of the Mediterranean, where they are replacing native species and becoming a "familiar sight".

According to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] definition, as well as [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and [[Ramsar Convention]] terminologies, they are alien species, as they are non-native (non-indigenous) to the Mediterranean Sea, and they are outside their normal area of distribution which is the Indo-Pacific region. When these species succeed in establishing populations in the Mediterranean sea, compete with and begin to replace native species they are "Alien Invasive Species", as they are an agent of change and a threat to the native biodiversity. In the context of CBD, "introduction" refers to the movement by human agency, indirect or direct, of an alien species outside of its natural range (past or present). The Suez Canal, being an artificial (man made) canal, is a human agency. Lessepsian migrants are therefore "introduced" species (indirect, and unintentional). Whatever wording is chosen, they represent a threat to the native Mediterranean biodiversity, because they are non-indigenous to this sea. In recent years, the Egyptian government's announcement of its intentions to deepen and widen the canal have raised concerns from [[marine biologist]]s, fearing that such an act will only worsen the invasion of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean, facilitating the crossing of the canal for yet additional species.<ref>Galil, B.S. and Zenetos, A. (2002). A sea change: exotics in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, in: Lepp<U+00E4>koski, E. et al. (2002). ''Invasive aquatic species of Europe: distribution, impacts and management''. pp. 325-336.</ref>

====Arrival of new tropical Atlantic species====
In recent decades, the arrival of exotic species from the tropical Atlantic has become a noticeable feature. Whether this reflects an expansion of the natural area of these species that now enter the Mediterranean through the Gibraltar strait, because of a warming trend of the water caused by [[Global Warming]]; or an extension of the maritime traffic; or is simply the result of a more intense scientific investigation, is still an open question. While not as intense as the "lessepsian" movement, the process deserves to be studied and monitored.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Sea-level rise===
By 2100, the overall level of the Mediterranean could rise between {{convert|3|to|61|cm|1|abbr=on}} as a result of the effects of [[climate change]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Mediterranean Sea Level Could Rise By Over Two Feet, Global Models Predict|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090303084057.htm|publisher=[[Science Daily]]|date=March 3, 2009}}</ref> This could have adverse effects on populations across the Mediterranean:
*Rising sea levels will submerge parts of [[Malta]]. Rising sea levels will also mean rising salt water levels in Malta's groundwater supply and reduce the availability of drinking water.<ref>{{cite news|title=Briny future for vulnerable Malta|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6525069.stm|date=April 4, 2007|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>
*A {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}} rise in sea level would flood {{convert|200|km2|0|abbr=out}} of the [[Nile Delta]], displacing over 500,000 [[Egyptians]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Egypt fertile Nile Delta falls prey to climate change|url=http://news.egypt.com/en/201001288902/news/-egypt-news/egypt-fertile-nile-delta-falls-prey-to-climate-change.html|date=2010-01-28}}</ref>

Coastal ecosystems also appear to be threatened by sea level rise, especially enclosed seas such as the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. These seas have only small and primarily east-west movement [[Habitat corridor|corridors]], which may restrict northward displacement of organisms in these areas.<ref>Nicholls, R.J.; Klein,R.J.T.

Managing European coasts: past, present and future. pp. 199-226.</ref> Sea level rise for the next century (2100) could be between {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|cm|in|abbr=on}} and temperature shifts of a mere 0.05-0.1<U+00B0>C in the deep sea are sufficient to induce significant changes in species richness and functional diversity.<ref name="greenpeace.org">{{cite web|url= http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/oceans/marine-reserves/the-mediterranean/mediterranean-other-threats|title=Other threats in the Mediterranean &#124; Greenpeace International|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref>

===Pollution===
Pollution in this region has been extremely high in recent years.{{When|date=May 2012}} The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] has estimated that {{convert|650000000|t|ST|abbr=on}} of [[sewage]], {{convert|129000|t|ST|abbr=on}} of [[mineral oil]], {{convert|60000|t|ST|abbr=on}} of mercury, {{convert|3800|t|ST|abbr=on}} of lead and {{convert|36000|t|ST|abbr=on}} of phosphates are dumped into the Mediterranean each year.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.explorecrete.com/nature/mediterranean.html|title=Pollution in the Mediterranean Sea. Environmental issues|publisher=Explorecrete.com|accessdate= April 23, 2010}}</ref> The [[Barcelona Convention]] aims to 'reduce pollution in the Mediterranean Sea and protect and improve the marine environment in the area, thereby contributing to its sustainable development.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l28084.htm|title=EUROPA| publisher=Europa|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref>
Many marine species have been almost wiped out because of the sea's pollution. One of them is the [[Mediterranean Monk Seal]] which is considered to be among the world's most [[endangered]] [[marine mammal]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.monachus-guardian.org/factfiles/medit01.htm|title=Mediterranean Monk Seal Fact Files: Overview|publisher=Monachus-guardian.org|date=May 5, 1978|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref>

The Mediterranean is also plagued by [[marine debris]]. A 1994 study of the [[seabed]] using trawl nets around the coasts of Spain, France and Italy reported a particularly high mean concentration of debris; an average of 1,935 items per km<U+00B2>. Plastic debris accounted for 76%, of which 94% was plastic bags.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/regionalseas/marinelitter publications/docs/anl_oview.pdf|title=Marine Litter: An analytical overview|accessdate=2008-08-01| year=2005|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme}}</ref>

===Shipping===
Some of the world's busiest shipping routes are in the Mediterranean Sea. It is estimated that approximately 220,000 [[merchant vessel]]s of more than 100 [[gross tonnage|tonnes]] cross the Mediterranean Sea each year<U+2014>about one third of the world's total merchant shipping. These ships often carry hazardous cargo, which if lost would result in severe damage to the marine environment.

The discharge of chemical tank washings and oily wastes also represent a significant source of marine pollution. The Mediterranean Sea constitutes 0.7% of the global water surface and yet receives seventeen percent of global marine oil pollution. It is estimated that every year between {{convert|100000|t|LT|abbr=on}} and {{convert|150000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of crude oil are deliberately released into the sea from shipping activities.

Approximately {{convert|370000000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of oil are transported annually in the Mediterranean Sea (more than 20% of the world total), with around 250-300 [[oil tanker]]s crossing the Sea every day. Accidental [[oil spill]]s happen frequently with an average of 10 spills per year. A major oil spill could occur at any time in any part of the Mediterranean.<ref name="greenpeace.org"/>

===Tourism===

With a unique combination of pleasant climate, beautiful coastline, rich history and diverse culture the Mediterranean region is the most popular tourist destination in the world<U+2014>attracting approximately one third of the world's international tourists.

Tourism is one of the most important sources of income for many Mediterranean countries. It also supports small communities in coastal areas and islands by providing alternative sources of income far from urban centres. However, tourism has also played major role in the degradation of the coastal and marine environment. Rapid development has been encouraged by Mediterranean governments to support the large numbers of tourists visiting the region each year. But this has caused serious disturbance to marine habitats such as erosion and pollution in many places along the Mediterranean coasts.

Tourism often concentrates in areas of high natural wealth, causing a serious threat to the habitats of endangered Mediterranean species such as sea turtles and monk seals.  Reductions in natural wealth may reduce incentives for tourists to visit.<ref name="greenpeace.org"/>

===Overfishing===
Fish stock levels in the Mediterranean Sea are alarmingly low. The European Environment Agency says that over 65% of all fish stocks in the region are outside safe biological limits and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, that some of the most important fisheries<U+2014>such as [[albacore]] and [[Atlantic bluefin tuna|bluefin tuna]], [[hake]], [[marlin]], [[swordfish]], [[red mullet]] and [[sea bream]]<U+2014>are threatened.{{date missing}}

There are clear indications that catch size and quality have declined, often dramatically, and in many areas larger and longer-lived species have disappeared entirely from commercial catches.

Large open water fish like tuna have been a shared fisheries resource for thousands of years but the stocks are now dangerously low. In 1999, [[Greenpeace]] published a report revealing that the amount of bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean had decreased by over 80% in the previous 20 years and government scientists warn that without immediate action the stock will collapse.

===Aquaculture===

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
[[Aquaculture]] is expanding rapidly<U+2014>often without proper environmental assessment<U+2014>and currently accounts for 30% of the fish protein consumed worldwide. The industry claims that farmed seafood lessens the pressure on wild fish stocks, yet many of the farmed species are carnivorous, consuming up to five times their weight in wild fish.

Mediterranean coastal areas are already over exposed to human influence, with pristine areas becoming ever scarcer. The aquaculture sector adds to this pressure, requiring areas of high water quality to set up farms. The installation of fish farms close to vulnerable and important habitats such as seagrass meadows is particularly concerning.
