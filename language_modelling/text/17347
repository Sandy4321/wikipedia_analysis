'''Duncan McMillan "Mickey" MacKay''' (May 25, 1894 <U+2013> May 30, 1940) was a Canadian professional [[ice hockey]] [[centre (ice hockey)|centre]] and [[Rover (ice hockey)|rover]] who played primarily in the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] (PCHL) and [[Western Canada Hockey League]] (WCHL) for the [[Vancouver Millionaires]] (later Maroons). He moved to the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) after the collapse of professional hockey in the west, and finished his career playing with the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]], [[Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL)|Pittsburgh Pirates]] and [[Boston Bruins]].

A gifted scorer, MacKay led the PCHA in goals three times, assists twice, and was the league's all-time leading scorer upon its demise. [[Lester Patrick]] called him the greatest centre to ever play in the coast league; he was named to the PCHA or WCHL first team all-star on seven occasions, and to the second team three times.  MacKay won the [[Stanley Cup]] twice during his career: first with the Millionaires in 1915 and later with the Bruins in 1929. He is honoured by the British Columbia Hockey Hall of Fame, and in 1952, was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]].

==Professional career==
[[File:Vancouver (Millionaires) Hockey Team, Vancouver Hockey Club copy of photocaricature of Duncan "Mickey" Mackay.jpg|thumbnail|left|Caricature of Mackay in 1919]]
Hoping to advance his career, MacKay wrote to [[Frank Patrick (ice hockey)|Frank Patrick]], operator of the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] (PCHA), expressing his desire to turn professional.  Patrick initially replied by suggesting the young player try out for a team closer to his hometown in Ontario. However, making what he described as a "[[Extrasensory perception|sixth sense]] hunch", Patrick wrote a second letter inviting MacKay to try out for his team in Vancouver.<ref name="SSPFuneral" /> Patrick doubted MacKay's ability the first time he saw him practice, but was convinced the second time around.<ref name="HeraldMacKayAccident">{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rBtkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JnsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1145,3276347 |title=Mickey MacKay dies following car accident |work=Calgary Herald |date=1940-05-31 |accessdate=2012-01-14 |page=8}}</ref> He signed MacKay to a contract for the [[1914<U+2013>15 PCHA season]] on November 3, 1914.<ref name="OGHHOF" />  MacKay made his professional debut on December 8, playing on a line with [[Frank Nighbor]] and [[Ken Mallen]] and scored a [[hat trick]] in his first game.<ref name="LOHBio">{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p195205&page=bio&list=ByName |title=Mickey MacKay biography |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref>  He finished the season as the league leader with 33 goals in just 17 games, and was named a first team all-star.<ref name="OGHHOF" /> Vancouver won the PCHA title, then defeated the [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]] to win the [[Stanley Cup]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wIcjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OYEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1534%2C2492659 |title=Vancouver won the Stanley Cup |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1915-03-27 |accessdate=2012-01-14 |page=16}}</ref> MacKay had four goals in the series in which Vancouver won all three games.<ref name="LOHBio" />

A late-season battle between the Millionaires and the [[Seattle Metropolitans]] in [[1919 PCHA season|1919]] turned violent when Seattle's [[Cully Wilson]] slashed MacKay across the mouth late in the game.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wQVkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zHoNAAAAIBAJ&pg=928%2C6003510 |title=Vancouver is still leading Pacific League |work=Calgary Herald |date=1919-02-27 |accessdate=2012-01-15 |page=12}}</ref>  MacKay suffered a broken jaw and lost five teeth as a result,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vg5kAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zXoNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3405%2C228059 |title=Injuries of Mickey MacKay are serious |work=Calgary Herald |date=1919-03-03 |accessdate=2012-01-15 |page=12}}</ref> while Wilson was later banned from the PCHA for life.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lytle |first=Andy |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SC5lAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zIgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5601,1455231 |title=Sport rays |work=Vancouver Sun |date=1932-12-13 |accessdate=2012-01-15 |page=12}}</ref>  MacKay left the PCHA following the season, moving to Alberta where he bought a farm near the village of [[Elnora, Alberta|Elnora]].<ref name="AlbertaFarm" /> He was one of several players who successfully petitioned the Alberta Amateur Athletic Union to regain his amateur status,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ieBfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Zm0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=3915,1796469 |title=Alberta white washes sixteen professionals |work=Saskatoon Phoenix |date=1919-11-24 |accessdate=2012-01-15 |page=5}}</ref> and signed on to play with the Calgary Columbus Club of the newly formed [[Big-4 League]].<ref name="CalgaryRetrospective">{{cite news |last=Mamini |first=Bob |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4hpkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=InsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1391,344048 |title=MacKay in Calgary |work=Calgary Herald |date=1940-06-04 |accessdate=2012-01-15 |page=6}}</ref>

MacKay returned to Vancouver and the professional ranks in 1920 amidst charges by Millionaires' owner Frank Patrick that the Big-4 was secretly paying players in violation of amateur standards.

Remaining a top scorer in the PCHA, MacKay lead the league in assists with 12 in [[1921<U+2013>22 PCHA season|1921<U+2013>22]] and in goals with 21 in [[1923<U+2013>24 PCHA season|1923<U+2013>24]].

MacKay began the [[1929<U+2013>30 NHL season|1929<U+2013>30 season]] with the Bruins, but chose to retire mid-season, although he continued as the team's business manager until the end of the year.<ref name="LOHBio" /> He was regarded by his contemporaries as one of the top players of his time. [[Lester Patrick]] praised his abilities: "He was perhaps the greatest centre we ever had on the coast. MacKay was a great crowd pleaser. He was clean, splendidly courageous, a happy player with a stylish way of going. He was one of those who helped make pro hockey a great game."<ref name="OGHHOF" /> His greatest limitation was his size, standing five foot nine and around 155 pounds; he frequently battled through injuries and missed many games throughout his career as a result.<ref name="CalgaryRetrospective" /> His nickname, "the wee Scot", was in reference to his diminutive size.<ref name="BCHHOF">{{cite web |url=http://www.bchhf.com/Inductees/mackay.htm |title=Mickey MacKay |publisher=British Columbia Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref>
