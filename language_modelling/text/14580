'''Mato Celestin Medovi<U+0107>''' was a [[Croats|Croatian]] artist born in Kuna on the [[Pelje<U+0161>ac]] peninsula on 17th November [[1857]], died [[Sarajevo]], 20th January [[1920]]. Best known for his large [[paintings]] depicting historical scenes, and his series of colourful landscapes and seascapes of his native [[Dalmatia]], Mato Celestin Medovi<U+0107> is one of the first generation of modern Croatian painters.

The young  Mato Medovi<U+0107> prepared for the priesthood in the Franciscan Seminary in [[Dubrovnik]], and was ordained in 1874, taking the name of Celestin. He received his early art training in Italy, then went on to study at the [[Academy of Arts in Munich|Academy of Arts]], where he worked on [[History painting | historical subjects]]. Following that, he decided to leave the church and pursue his painting career. Moving to [[Zagreb]], he joined the group of artists around the renowned painter [[Vlacho Bukovac]]. His work from this time includes historical compositions in the building of the [[Croatian Institute of History | Croatian Institute of History]] ({{lang-hr|Hrvatski institut za povijest}}). From 1901, Medovi<U+0107> spent increasing amounts of time on his native Pelje<U+0161>ac, painting nature themes, [[still life]]s, [[seascape]]s and [[landscape]]s in a fresh style with colour, light and soft shadows.<ref name="remek-djela"/>


==Biography==

Mato Medovi<U+0107> was born on 17 November 1857 in Kuna on the Pelje<U+0161>ac peninsula into a peasant family.<ref name="remek-djela"/> Young Mato got his first education at a nearby [[Franciscan]] monastery dedicated to Our Lady of Loreto (Delorita).<ref name="hrt"/> In 1868, at the age of 11 he joined the Franciscan seminary in [[Dubrovnik]], where he took his vows in 1874, taking the name of Celestin.<ref name="remek-djela"/> The artistic talent of the young monk was noticed by Abbot Portoguaro Bernardino, on a visit from Rome. So in 1880, Medovi<U+0107> was placed in the monastery of St Isidoro in [[Rome]], known for its [[Nazarene movement |Nazarene painters]]. He was assigned to [[Lodovico Seitz]], an influential artist who painted the [[fresco]]es in the [[Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul in <U+0110>akovo|Cathedral of <U+0110>akovo]].<ref name="hrt"/> However, the rigid and outdated artistic style did not suit Medovi<U+0107>, and he looked for a different teacher in [[Giuseppe Grandi]], then in the private school of [[Antonio Ciseri]] in [[Florence]].<ref name="remek-djela"/>
[[Image:Dolazak Hrvata Celestin Medovi<U+0107>.JPG|250px|thumb|Arrival of the Croats ({{lang-hr|Dolazak Hrvata}}) by Mato Celestin Medovi<U+0107>]]
In 1886, the Franciscan order sent him back to Dubrovnik. However, at the urging of the painter [[Emil Jakob Schindler]], he was sent to continue his studies at the [[Academy of Arts in Munich]]. There Medovi<U+0107> studied [[Historical painting|historical genre paintings]], particularly the work of [[Karl von Piloty]]. He composed large canvases of historical scenes, winning a silver medal in 1893 for his final diploma work "Bacchanal" ({{lang-hr|Bakanal}}), and successfully exhibited his work in several European cities.<ref name="remek-djela"/>

On his return to Dubrovnik in 1893, there seemed no possibility for further artistic progress. Dr [[Franjo Ra<U+010D>ki]] (a founder member of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]) and Dr Iso Kr<U+0161>njav (head of the Department of Culture ({{lang-hr|odjela za kulturu}}) invited him to Zagreb to join the group of artists around [[Vlaho Bukovac]], a Dubrovnik artist who had recently left Paris and settled in Zagreb. So in 1895 Medovi<U+0107> lef the Franciscan order and set up a studio in Zagreb. During his stay there (1895-1907) he painted many religious works in northern Croatian churches ([[Kri<U+017E>evci]], [[Pozega]], [[Nova Gradiska]]) and historical compositions based on Croatian history,<ref name="remek-djela"/> the  most notably those in the Golden Hall ({{lang-hr|Zlatne dvorane}}) of the Institute of History in Zagreb. Medovi<U+0107> also painted a series of portraits of Zagreb people using fragmented lines, soft contours and vibrant colours.<ref name="hrt"/>

In 1898, Medovi<U+0107> had a  house and studio built in Kuna, and a villa on the coast at Crkvice. He began to spend increasing amounts of time there, painting nature. In 1901, he held a group exhibit with [[Oton Ivekovi<U+0107>]], in which he presented his entire Zagreb works. Until 1907 Medovi<U+0107> was kept busy with government works in Zagreb and exhibited with other Croatian artists in [[Budapest]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Paris]], [[Prague]], [[Belgrade]], [[Sofia]] and Zagreb.<ref name="remek-djela"/>

After 1908, Medovi<U+0107> gave up his Zagreb studio entirely and remained on the Pelje<U+0161>ac peninsula, living alone and painting. His subjects were taken from the nature around him, still lifes of fruit and fish, seascapes, and landscapes, filled with colour, light and soft shadows.<ref name="remek-djela"/> His seascapes are studies of light playing on the open sea, breaking waves or a moonlit night.<ref name="hrt"/>

After a few years Medovi<U+0107> grew tired of the isolation from other artists, and for a short time worked in Vienna (1912-1914). In 1914 he held an exhibition, where he sold all his paintings. At the start of the [[First World War]] he again went back to Kuna where the harsh living conditions took their toll on his health.  By the end of the war Medovi<U+0107> was suffering from renal disease and in late December 1919 he sought help at a hospital in [[Sarajevo]], but too late. <ref name="remek-djela"/> He died on 20th January 1920, and was laid to rest in the cemetery in Kuna.<ref name="hrt"/>

==Legacy==

[[Image:Krunidba Celestin Medovi<U+0107>.JPG|thumb|250px|"The Coronation of King Ladislas" ({{lang-hr|Krunidba kralja Ladislava}}) by Mato Celestin Medovi<U+0107>]]
Medovi<U+0107>'s time in Italy did not leave a lasting impression his work. His paintings from the time can be found in a few Franciscan monasteries, for example [[Fucecchio]], [[Faenza]], and [[Cesena]].<ref name="remek-djela"/>

His years spent at the Academy of Art in Munich (1888-1893) were more formative. There he adopted the style and neutral colors typical of the late 19th century. Some very well-preserved portraits ("Mother" ({{lang-hr|Majka}}), "Old Fisherman" ({{lang-hr|Stari ribar}}), "Portrait of an old man" ({{lang-hr|Portret starca}}) are impressive studies of elderly people. A few paintings of saints, for example "St. Bonaventura", painted during this period, all reveal a high quality realistic interpretation. <ref name="remek-djela"/>

During his time in Zagreb (1895-1907), Medovi<U+0107>  gradually absorbed some of Bukovac's techniques and brighter colours into his own artistic personality. His large historical compositions, "Srijemski Martyr" ({{lang-hr|Srijemski mu<U+010D>enik}})", "Split Parliament" ({{lang-hr|Splitski sabor}}), "Arrival of the Croats"  ({{lang-hr|Dolazak Hrvata}}),  "Betrothal of King Zvonimir"  ({{lang-hr|Zaruke kralja Zvonimira}}), and "The Coronation of King Ladislas" ({{lang-hr|Krunidba kralja Ladislava}}) demonstrate Medovi<U+0107>'s eye for detail and his skillful interpretation of the subject. Portraits from this time include the expressive "St. Francis", and some drawings and paintings of the people of Zagreb.<ref name="remek-djela"/>

Medovi<U+0107>'s work on the Pelje<U+0161>ac peninsula marked a complete departure in technique and themes. He painted still lifes, seascapes, and landscapes, which were new genres in Croatian art at the time. His palette became lighter and brighter as he worked outdoors: browns, greys and dull greens became purer, and were joined the purple of heather, the yellow of broom, and the rich array of blues of the sea. Abandoning his previously detailed style, his smaller studies from nature are more creative. With thick impasto and impulsive brush strokes, around 1907 a new style emerged in his work <U+2013> [[pointillism]] in a light, bright colours, that he used for his landscapes of Pelje<U+0161>ac. Initially (1908<U+2013>1912), these were disciplined strokes on larger canvases, but in his later (1914<U+2013>1918), smaller paintings with impressionistically captured motifs, the strokes became softer and more diffuse colours. He was one of the first Croatian artists to paint the coastal landscapes, and it dominated his work after the turn of the century.<ref name="remek-djela"/>

Medovi<U+0107> was a versatile  artist, among the first generation of modern Croatian painters. He was the leader in historical<ref name="vijesti"/> and religious paintings (from intimate images of saints to altarpieces such as those at [[Pasman]], [[Baska]] and [[Vrboska]] on the island of [[Hvar]]). He painted some fine portraits,<ref name="remek-djela"/> and Medovi<U+0107> was the only Croatian artist in this period painting still lifes. However, his major contribution to Croatian painting is his series of landscapes, full of bright southern light and vigorous colours.<ref name="ugdubrovnik"/>

His hometown of Kuna now hosts an art colony, and art gallery in his name - KUD Mato Celestin Medovi<U+0107>.

Medovic's painting of "Pelje<U+0161>ko - kor<U+010D>ulanski kanal", 1908-1912 appeared on a Croatian Post Office stamp in 1996.<ref name="hrposta"/>
