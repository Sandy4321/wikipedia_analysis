'''Arbiter''' is a fictional ceremonial, religious and political rank bestowed upon alien [[Covenant (Halo)#Races|Covenant Elite]]s in the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' science fiction universe. In the 2004 video game ''[[Halo 2]]'', the rank is given to a disgraced commander as a way to atone for his failures. Although the Arbiter is intended to die serving the Covenant leadership, the [[Characters of Halo#The High Prophets|High Prophets]], he survives his missions and the Prophets' subsequent betrayal of his kind. When he learns that the Prophets' plans would doom all life in the galaxy to extinction, the Arbiter allies with the Covenant's enemies<U+2014>humanity<U+2014>and stops the ringworld [[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]] from being activated. The Arbiter is a [[player character|playable character]] in ''Halo&nbsp;2'' and its 2007 sequel ''[[Halo 3]]''; a different Arbiter appears in the 2009 [[real-time strategy]] game ''[[Halo Wars]]'', which takes place 20&nbsp;years before the events of the main trilogy.

The appearance of the Arbiter in ''Halo&nbsp;2'' and the change in perspective from the main human protagonist [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] to a former enemy was a plot twist ''Halo'' developer [[Bungie]] kept highly secret. The character's name was changed from "[[Dervish]]" after concerns that the name reinforced a perceived United States versus [[Islam]] allegory in the game's plot. Award-winning actor [[Keith David]] lends his voice to the character in ''Halo&nbsp;2'' and ''3'', while [[David Sobolov]] voices the Arbiter of ''Halo Wars''.

The Arbiter has appeared in three series of action figures and other collectibles and marketing in addition to appearances in the games. Bungie intended the sudden point of view switch to a member of the Covenant as [[plot twist]] that no one would have seen coming, but the character in particular and the humanization of the Covenant in general was not evenly received by critics and fans. ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' derided the Arbiter's missions as "crap bits" in ''Halo&nbsp;2''. Conversely, [[IGN]] lamented the loss of the Arbiter's story in ''Halo&nbsp;3'' and missed the added dimension the character provided to the story.

==Character design==
The Arbiter in the ''Halo'' trilogy is voiced by [[Keith David]], a New York voice actor. David noted that he enjoys voicing complicated characters who have a past. To make an impact with voice acting, he says, is difficult<U+2014>"it's either good acting or it's bad acting".<ref>{{cite video |people= [[Keith David|David, Keith]]|year2= 2007|title=Mass Effect Voice Acting Interview|url=http://xboxmovies.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/5725/Celebrity-Voice-Overs/ |format=Flash |publisher=[[Bioware]] |location= |accessdate=2007-11-07 |time=00:42 |quote=The difference between [acting in video games as opposed to animation] is slight.

The Arbiter changed very little during development, as the overall appearance of the alien Covenant Elites had been designed and developed for the previous game, 2001's ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]''. The only substantial difference between the Arbiter and other Elites is ceremonial armor seen in early concept sketches and which appeared in the final design.<ref name=aoh74>{{cite book |last= Trautmann|first=Eric|title=The Art of Halo|year= 2004|publisher= [[Del Ray Books]]|location=New York |isbn=0345475860 |page=74}}</ref> During ''Halo 2''{{'}}s early developmental stages the character's name was "[[Dervish]]",<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff| url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=154549| title=The A-Z of Halo 3| work=[[Computer and Video Games (magazine)|Computer and Video Games]]| date=2007-01-11| accessdate=2007-11-07}}</ref> a name from the Sufi sect of [[Islam]]. Out of context, [[Microsoft Game Studios]]' "geocultural review" consultants found nothing wrong with the name.

In an interview with [[MTV]], ''Halo'' developer [[Bungie]]'s content manager Frank O'Connor said that the inclusion of the Arbiter as a playable character in ''Halo&nbsp;2'' was supposed to be a "secret on the scale of a [[M.

The Arbiter in the ''Halo'' trilogy was previously a Supreme Commander in the Covenant fleet, having commanded the ships that follow the human vessel ''Pillar of Autumn'' to the ringworld [[Halo (megastructure)#Installation 04|Halo]] during the events of ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]''. A Prophet orders the ''Autumn'' not to be destroyed outright, lest the ring be damaged; this hesitance allows the humans to land on the ring, coordinate a resistance, and ultimately destroy the ring to stop the spread of the parasitic [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Dietz|first= William|title=[[Halo: The Flood]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-45921-0|page=6}}</ref> In the [[Halo: First Strike|aftermath]] of the incident, the commander also loses a Covenant ship to UNSC forces, resulting in the annihilation of a Covenant invasion force heading for Earth.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nylund|first= Eric|title=[[Halo: First Strike]]|year= 2003|publisher= Ballantine Books|location=New York |isbn=0-345-46781-7 |page=340}}</ref> As ''[[Halo 2]]'' begins, the Covenant High Council brands the Commander a heretic for letting the ringworld<U+2014>which the Covenant consider a sacred relic<U+2014>be destroyed.<ref>"'''Prophet of Regret:''' Noble Prophet of Truth, this has gone on long enough.

===Critical reception===
The reception of the Arbiter as a playable character in ''Halo&nbsp;2'' was mixed; O'Conner described the Arbiter as the most controversial character Bungie had ever created.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[SCI FI]]|url=http://gameroom.mlgpro.com/view/zyiJ5z9YWvg.html|title=Sci vs. Fi <U+2013> ''Halo 3'' Documentary|publisher=[[Major League Gaming]]|accessdate=2007-10-05|date=2007-10-02}}</ref> The character was described as a "brilliant stroke of a game design" because it provided an unexpected story line but also offered the player new options by allowing stealth gameplay.<ref name="Gates">{{cite web| author=McLain, Alex | year=2007|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/h/halo2/spotlight14.htm| title=The Big One| publisher=Microsoft Corporation| accessdate=2007-10-20}}</ref> Several publications enjoyed the added dimension to the Covenant by having the Arbiter as a playable character.<ref>{{cite news|author=Davenport, Misha|date=2004-11-08|title=Superior sequel has a surprise in store|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|page=47}}</ref>

Alternatively, publications like [[Gamespot]] thought that while the Arbiter and Covenant side added "newfound complexity to the story", it distracted the player from Earth's fate;<ref>{{cite web|author=Kasavin, Greg|date=2004-11-07|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/halo2/review.html?page=2|title=''Halo 2'' for Xbox Review|publisher=[[Gamespot]]|accessdate=2007-10-20}}</ref> a panel of ''Halo&nbsp;2'' reviewers argued that though the decision to humanize the Covenant by the introduction of the Arbiter was welcome, the execution in-game was lacking.<ref name=free>{{cite web|author=Staff|year=2004|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041211022905/http://www.teamfremont.com/reviews/Halo2.shtml|archivedate=2004-12-11|url=http://www.teamfremont.com/reviews/Halo2.shtml|title=Team Freemont: Halo 2 review|publisher=Team Freemont|accessdate=2007-09-05}}</ref> The missions where the player controls the Arbiter were described as "anything but easy" and occasionally "boring", due to the lack of human weapons to balance the gameplay.<ref name=free/> A review performed by ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' described the time that the player controls the character as "[those] crap bits when you play as an alien Arbiter" and listed this as one of ''Halo&nbsp;2''{{'}}s flaws.<ref>{{cite web| author=Porter, Will| url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=164526| title=PC Reviews: Halo 2| publisher=[[Computer and Video Games]]| date=2007-06-06| accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref> Reviewer Jarno Kokko said that while he did not personally dislike playing as the character, the idea of "people disliking the concept of playing on the other side in a game that is supposed to be the 'Master Chief blows up some alien scum' show" was a plausible complaint.<ref name="YG">{{cite web| author=Kokko, Jarno| url=http://www.yougamers.com/reviews/4722_halo_2_for_windows_vista/| title=Review: Halo 2 for Windows Vista| publisher=yougamers.com| date=2007-06-18| accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref>

The reception of the Arbiter's elimination as a main playable character in ''Halo&nbsp;3'' was similarly mixed.
