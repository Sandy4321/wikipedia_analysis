'''The Azanian People's Liberation Army''' ('''APLA''') was the military wing of the [[Pan Africanist Congress]] (PAC) in [[South Africa]]. It was originally called '''Poqo'''.

In the 1960's the APLA commander Potlako Leballo (1915-1986) modeled the force on the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Templeton Ntantala was his deputy. In 1976 APLA received 500 recruits and also 178 Basotho for a new Lesotho Liberation Army (LLA) from the exiled Basutoland Congress Party under Matooane Mapefane, who was a senior instructor of APLA in Libya. Ntantala's original group of 70 APLA soldiers felt threatened by the influx of new recruits. A coup attempt by Ntantala against Leballo in Dar es Salaam was prevented by LLA soldiers, which exacerbated tensions within the PAC between the "Diplomat-Reformist"(DR) and "Maoist-Revolutionary" (MR) groups. After the death of the PAC leader Mangaliso Sobukwe in 1978 the Americans financed a take over of the PAC by David Sibeko (DR) as part of the Carter administration's quid pro quo South African strategy whereby South Africa would put pressure on the Rhodesian regime to negotiate a settlement in return for American pressure on the ANC and PAC to accept detente and dialogue instead of armed struggle. The take over was only partially successful for although Tanzania banished Leballo, the leaders of the new APLA force assassinated Sibeko and the LLA managed to leave for the south before the crisis erupted. Vus Make was appointed the new PAC leader but this sparked a mutiny at Chunya camp on March 11, 1980, during which several APLA troops were killed and the remainder split up and confined to different camps. Many escaped to Kenya. Leballo himself relocated to Zimbabwe in late 1980 along with senior MR intelligence and air force personnel but Tanzanian pressure in May-June 1981 resulted in his deportation and the expulsion or imprisonment of the others. Make was replaced by John Nyathi Pokela (died 1985) recently released from Robben Island but his ineffectual term of office was marred by further mutinies, executions and assassinations. Following Pokela<U+2019>s death Leballo made a comeback through support from Libya, North Korea, and Ghana but after his sudden death in January 1986 (when it was discovered he was actually 70 not 60) the PAC DR group, outmaneuvered by the ANC, became a deeply troubled organization with a semi national socialist political front but a  new APLA that rejected the APLA (MR) concept of the guerrilla as a social reformer and instead adopted an ultimately disastrous slogan of <U+201C>one settler one bullet.<U+201D> In the [[1990]]<U+2013>[[1994|94]] period it became known for its attacks on civilians despite the progress in negotiations at the [[Convention for a Democratic South Africa]].

In 1994 APLA was absorbed into the new [[South African National Defence Force]] but MR members refused to accept the settlement. Attempts by MR officers to regroup in Vietnam, North Korea, and China were unsuccessful although links have been maintained with the Tamil Tigers and Maoist groups in Nepal and India and occasional propaganda leaflets distributed within South Africa focusing on disparity of wealth and the land issue.

The [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)]] found "PAC action directed towards whites to have been gross violations of human rights for which the PAC and APLA leadership are held to be morally and politically responsible and accountable".<ref>{{cite journal | quotes = | date = | year = | month = | title = The Liberation Movements from 1960 to 1990 | journal = Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa Report | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 692 | publisher = [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)]] | url = http://www.doj.gov.za/trc/report/finalreport/TRC%20VOLUME%202.pdf | quote = THE COMMISSION FINDS THAT THE TARGETING OF CIVILIANS FOR KILLING WAS NOT ONLY A GROSS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS OF THOSE AFFECTED BUT A VIOLATION OF INTERNAL HUMANITARIAN LAW.}}</ref>
