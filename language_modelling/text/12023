'''John Elton Le Mesurier Halliley''' (5&nbsp;April&nbsp;1912{{spaced ndash}}15&nbsp;November&nbsp;1983), better known as '''John Le Mesurier''',  was a [[BAFTA]] Award-winning English actor. He is best remembered for his role as [[Sergeant Arthur Wilson]] in the [[BBC]] situation comedy ''[[Dad's Army]]'' (1968<U+2013>77).

Born in [[Bedfordshire]], England, Le Mesurier became interested in the stage from an early age and enrolled at the [[Fay Compton]] Studio of Dramatic Art in 1933. From there he took a position in [[repertory theatre]] and made his stage debut in September 1934 at the Palladium Theatre in Edinburgh in the [[J. B. Priestley]] play ''[[Dangerous Corner]]'' and later accepted an offer to work with Alec Guinness in a [[John Gielgud]] production of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]''. He first appeared on television in 1938 as Seigneur de Miolans in the BBC broadcast of "The Marvellous History of St Bernard". 

During the Second World War he was posted to [[British Raj|British India]], as a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] and returned to make his film debut in 1948, where he starred in the [[B movie|second feature]] comedy short ''[[Death in the Hand]]'', opposite [[Esme Percy]] and [[Ernest Jay]].  He undertook a number of roles on television in 1951 and met [[Tony Hancock]] who, along with Le Mesurier's wife, [[Hattie Jacques]], starred in ''[[Educating Archie]]''.

Le Mesurier went on to appear in over 100 films, mostly portraying figures of authority such as army officers, policemen and judges, including ''[[Private's Progress]]'' (1956), ''[[Brothers in Law (film)|Brothers in Law]]'' (1957), ''[[Carlton-Browne of the F.O.]]'' (1959), ''[[I'm All Right Jack]]'' (1959), ''[[The Wrong Arm of the Law]]'' (1963), ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' (1963), ''[[The Italian Job]]'' (1969) and ''[[The Alf Garnett Saga]]'' (1972). In ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959) he has an uncredited role as a doctor. He also appeared in [[Tony Hancock]]'s two principal film vehicles ''[[The Rebel (1961 film)|The Rebel]]'' (1961) and ''[[The Punch and Judy Man]]'' (1963), and many episodes of Hancock's television series ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]''.  A heavy drinker of alcohol for most of his life, Le Mesurier died on 15 November 1983, aged 71 from a stomach haemorrhage, a complication of the [[cirrhosis]] of the liver from which he had suffered during his final years.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Le Mesurier was born at 35 Chaucer Road, [[Bedford]], [[Bedfordshire]] in 1912.{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1984|p=1}} His parents were Charles Elton Halliley, a [[solicitor]],{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=1}} and Amy Michelle (n<U+00E9>e Le Mesurier), whose family were from [[Alderney]] in the [[Channel Islands]];{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=2}} both families were affluent with histories of government service, or work in the legal profession.{{sfn|McCann|2010|pp=1-2}}{{efn|On his father's side, the Halliley family had been civil servants based abroad; Elton's father, Charles Bailey Halliley, was raised in [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] where his father was a senior civil servant in the Customs Department.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=1}} Other members of the Halliley family held high ranks in the services, or positions of power in Whitehall.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=2}} Amy Le Mesurier's family included the Reverend [[Thomas Le Mesurier (cleric)|Thomas Le Mesurier]], a British lawyer, cleric and polemicist; [[John Le Mesurier (Alderney)|John Le Mesurier]], the last hereditary [[governor]] of [[Alderney]]; and Colonel Frederick Le Mesurier, the inventor of the [[RML 2.5 inch Mountain Gun|screw gun]]{{sfn|McCann|2010|pp=1-2}}}} He was brought up in [[Bury St Edmunds]], Suffolk and educated at Grenham House school in [[Kent]] and [[Sherborne School]] in [[Dorset]], where he attended classes with [[Alan Turing]];{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=33}} Le Mesurier disliked both institutions intensely.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=42}} After leaving school he was persuaded to follow in his father's footsteps, and commenced work as a clerk at a firm of solicitors in Bury St Edmunds called Greene & Greene, and took up amateur acting in his spare time.<ref name="Nimmo (DNB)" />

From an early age, Le Mesurier was interested in the stage.  He would frequently visit the [[West End of London]] to watch [[Ralph Lynn]] and [[Tom Walls]] who performed plays at the [[Aldwych Theatre]] known as the [[Aldwych Farces]].  These early experiences confirmed an ambition to appear on the stage,<ref name="Nimmo (DNB)" /> and a desire to leave the clerking job that he found uninteresting.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=53}} In early 1933 he discussed his decision with his parents, saying that, "the law was about to lose an unpromising recruit".{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1984|p=19}} In September 1933 he enrolled at the [[Fay Compton]] Studio of Dramatic Art, along with [[Alec Guinness]], with whom Le Mesurier became close friends.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=58}} In July 1934 the Studio provided their annual public review and both Le Mesurier and Guinness took part; among the judges for the event were [[John Gielgud]], [[Leslie Henson]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Ivor Novello]].{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=61}} Le Mesurier received a Certificate of Fellowship, while Guinness won the Fay Compton prize.<ref name="ST: Compton awards" /> Rather than remain at the studio for further tuition Le Mesurier decided to leave and take a position in [[repertory theatre]] with the Edinburgh-based Millicent Ward Repertory Players, earning <U+00A3>3.10s a week.<ref name="Nimmo (DNB)" />{{sfn|McCann|2010|pp=63-4}}

===Career===
====1934<U+2013>46====
The Millicent Ward repertory company, like many others of its kind, would stage a new three-act play each week, with rehearsals during the day for a new production, with evening performances for the work rehearsed the previous week.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=67}} At this juncture, Le Mesurier appeared as "John Halliley"{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=68}} and made his stage debut in September 1934 at the Palladium Theatre in Edinburgh in the [[J. B. Priestley]] play ''[[Dangerous Corner]]'', along with three other newcomers to the company.<ref name="Scotsman: Dangerous Corner" /> The reviewer for ''[[The Scotsman]]'' thought that Le Mesurier was "well cast".<ref name="Scotsman: Dangerous Corner" /> After appearances in successive months at the Palladium, in productions of ''While Parents Sleep'', ''[[Dangerous Corner]]'' and [[Cavalcade (play)|''Cavalcade'']], a break took place in the season because of problems with the lease at the theatre: in the interim, Le Mesurier accepted an offer to work with his friend Alec Guinness in a John Gielgud production of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]''. Le Mesurier was an extra in the play, although he was also the [[understudy]] for [[Anthony Quayle]]'s role of [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern|Guildenstern]].{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=69}}

In July 1935 he was hired by the Oldham repertory company, based at the [[Oldham Coliseum Theatre|Coliseum Theatre]] in Oldham; his first production with them was a version of the [[Wilson Collison]] play, ''Up in Mabel's Room'', although he was sacked after one week for oversleeping one day and missing a performance.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=71}}{{efn|On hearing the story later, No<U+00EB>l Coward told Le Mesurier "A very sensible choice of play to sleep through, dear boy".<ref name="S Times: Worrier" />{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1984|p=29}}}} In September 1935, he moved to the [[Sheffield Repertory Theatre]] and appeared in ''Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary'', and played [[Malvolio]] in Shakespeare's ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' in November of that year. From September 1936 to September 1937, Le Mesurier was employed by the Croydon Repertory Theatre, appearing in some nine of their productions, including ''Peace In Our Time'' in September 1936, ''Dusty Ermine'' and ''[[The Apple Cart]]'' in October 1936, ''Bees on the Boat Deck'', ''[[Ah, Wilderness!]]'' and ''The Constant Nymph'' (playing Lewis Dodd) in November 1936 and ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'' from December 1936 to January 1937. Between January and September 1937 Le Mesurier changed his professional name from John Halliley, under which name he had been billed up to that date, to John Le Mesurier, under which name he appeared for the remainder of his career. As his biographer Graham McCann observed, "he never bothered, at least in public, to explain the reason for his decision".{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=77}} For his next role, in the September 1937 production of ''[[Love on the Dole#The Play|Love on the Dole]]'', Le Mesurier used his new name for the first time.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=78}}

He first appeared on television in April 1938 as Seigneur de Miolans in the [[BBC]] broadcast of "The Marvellous History of St Bernard", a production adapted by [[Henri Gheon]] from a 15th century manuscript.{{sfn|Barry|1992|p=190}} From July to October 1938 he was employed by both the [[Royal Lyceum Theatre]] in Edinburgh and the [[Theatre Royal, Glasgow|Theatre Royal]] in [[Glasgow]], putting on a performance of ''The Romantic Young Lady'' in both in July 1938; similarly, he appeared in ''Husband to a Famous Woman'' at both theatres the following month.

From May to October 1939, Le Mesurier appeared in numerous theatres across London, including the [[Apollo Theatre|Apollo]] and [[Savoy Theatre|Savoy]], in a production of ''[[Gas Light]]''. The play was subsequently taken on tour and performed at the [[Grand Theatre, Blackpool|Grand Theatre]] in [[Blackpool]] in July 1939, and the [[Prince's Theatre, Manchester|Prince's Theatre]] in [[Manchester]] in October 1939. The review in ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'' considered that Le Mesurier gave "a faultless performance", and went on to say that, "the character is not overemphasised. One may praise it best by saying that Mr. Le Mesurier gives one a really uncomfortable feeling in the stomach".<ref name="Guardian: Gas Light" />

From November to December 1939, Le Mesurier went on tour of England in a production of ''Goodness, How Sad!''.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=83}} In January and February 1940 he returned to the Grand Theatre in Blackpool, appearing in ''[[French Without Tears]]''. From March to May 1940 he was employed by the Brixton Theatre in London, appearing in productions of ''The Man in Half Moon Street'', ''Mystery at Greenfingers'' and ''The First Mrs Fraser''.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=306}} 

Just over a year after the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], in September 1940, the house which Le Mesurier had rented was hit by a bomb and he lost all his possessions;{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=88}} the same bombing raid had also hit the theatre in Brixton in which he was working.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=89}} A few days later he reported for basic training with the [[Royal Armoured Corps]],{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=90}} and was subsequently commissioned into the [[Royal Tank Regiment]] on 28 June 1941.<ref name="LG 11 July 1941" /> During the war he served in the United Kingdom until 1943 and was subsequently posted to [[British Raj|British India]], as a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]],{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=95}} where he spent the rest of the war.<ref name="Nimmo (DNB)" /> Le Mesurier later said of his wartime service that he had, "a comfortable war, with captaincy thrust upon me, before I was [[Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after World War II|demobbed]] in 1946."<ref name="Guardian Obit" />

====1946<U+2013>59====
After wartime service, Le Mesurier returned to acting, although he initially struggled to find work.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=104}} In addition to a few small roles with Croydon rep, he had his radio debut on the [[BBC Light Programme]] in a November 1946 adaptation of [[Just William]], where he played Uncle Noel.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=104}} In February 1948 he made his film debut in the [[B movie|second feature]] comedy short ''[[Death in the Hand]]'',{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=111}} opposite [[Esme Percy]] and [[Ernest Jay]].<ref name="BFI: Death in the Hand" /> In 1949 he had a small role opposite [[Arthur Lucan]], [[Kitty McShane]] and [[Chili Bouchier]] in [[John Harlow (director)|John Harlow]]'s comedy picture, ''[[Mother Riley's New Venture]]'', although his name was misspelt on the credits as "Le Meseurier".<ref name="BFI: Mother Riley's New Venture" />{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=112}} In 1950 he starred in [[Charles Saunders (director)|Charles Saunders]]'s ''[[Dark Interval]]'', a crime film also featuring starring [[Zena Marshall]], [[Andrew Osborn]] and John Barry.<ref name="BFI: Dark Interval" /> 

Le Mesurier undertook a number of roles on television in 1951, including in six episodes of the BBC children's programme ''Whirligig'';{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=117}} the role of Doctor Forrest in ''The Railway Children'';<ref name="BFI: The Railway Children" /> the role of Sir Alexander Blythe in children's comedy-thriller ''Show Me a Spy'';<ref name="BFI: Show Me a Spy" /> the part of the blackmailer Eduardo Lucas in ''Sherlock Holmes: The Second Stain'', opposite [[Alan Wheatley]]'s Holmes;<ref name="BFI: The Second Stain" /> and Joseph in the nativity play ''A Time to be Born''.<ref name="BFI: A Time to Be Born" /> 1951 was also the year that [[Tony Hancock]] joined Le Mesurier's wife, [[Hattie Jacques]] in the series ''[[Educating Archie]]''; Le Mesurier and Hancock became friends and would often go for drinking sessions around [[Soho]] and ending up in jazz clubs.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=136}} Hancock left ''Educating Archie'' in 1954 to work on his own radio show<U+2014>''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]'',{{sfn|Foster|Furst|1996|p=188}} but still kept up his friendship with Le Mesurier, whilst Jacques joined the cast of the show in 1956, for the fourth series.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=24}}

In 1952 he again worked with Saunders and Marshall in ''[[Blind Man's Bluff (1952 film)|Blind Man's Bluff]]'' and also had an uncredited role as a [[Scotland Yard]] officer in ''[[Mother Riley Meets the Vampire]]''.{{sfn|Browning|Picart|2010|p=127}} During the course of the year he also appeared as the doctor in ''Angry Dust'' at the New Torch Theatre, London. Parnell Bradbury, writing in ''[[The Times]]'' thought Le Mesurier had played the role "extraordinarily well",<ref name="Times: Angry Dust" /> although [[Harold Hobson]], writing in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' thought that "the trouble with Mr. John Le Mesurier's  Dr. Weston is that he approaches the man too snarlingly&nbsp;... [it is] a notion of genius that would be unacceptable anywhere outside Victorian melodrama".<ref name="S Times: Angry Dust" /> In 1953 he had a role as a bureaucrat in the short film ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1953 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'', which won the ''Prix de Fantasie Poetique'' at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1954.<ref name="BFI: Pleasure Garden"/> In 1953 he also played inspectors in the crime films ''[[The Drayton Case]]'' and ''[[Black 13]]'', the latter directed by [[Ken Hughes]] and co-starring Peter Reynolds, [[Rona Anderson]] and [[Patrick Barr]]; he again worked with John Harlow in the 1954 film ''[[Dangerous Cargo]]''. After a long run of small roles in the B-pictures, his 1955 portrayal of the registrar in [[Roy Boulting]]'s comedy ''[[Josephine and Men]]'', "jerked him out of the rut", according to [[Philip Oakes]];<ref name="S Times: Worrier" /> he appeared opposite [[Glynis Johns]], [[Jack Buchanan]], [[Donald Sinden]] and [[Peter Finch]] in the film.{{sfn|Burton|O'Sullivan|Wells|Aldgate|2000|p=277}} Later in 1955 he appeared in another Saunders crime film, ''[[A Time to Kill (1955 film)|A Time to Kill]]'', with [[Jack Watling]], [[Rona Anderson]] and [[John Horsley (actor)|John Horsley]].<ref name="BFI: A Time to Kill" />

Following his appearance in ''Josephine and Men'', [[Boulting brothers|John and Roy Boulting]] turned again to Le Mesurier and cast him as a psychiatrist in their 1956 Second World War film, ''[[Private's Progress]]'', in a cast that featured a number of leading British actors of this period, such as [[Ian Carmichael]], [[Richard Attenborough]], [[Dennis Price]] and [[Terry-Thomas]].<ref name="S Times: Private's Progress" /> [[Dilys Powell]], reviewing for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' thought that the cast was "embellished" by Le Mesurier's presence, among others.<ref name="S Times: Private's Progress" /> The film received a mixed reception, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, "as a lighthearted satire on British army life during the last war, Private's Progress has moments of sheer joy based on real authenticity. But it is not content to rest on satire alone and introduces an unreal melodramatic adventure which robs the story of much of its charm."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117794172?refcatid=31|title=Private's Progress|publisher= ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref> Later in 1956 he had again appeared alongside Attenborough with small roles in [[Jay Lewis]]'s ''[[The Baby and the Battleship]]'' and Roy Boulting's ''[[Brothers in Law (film)|Brothers in Law]]'', also featuring Carmichael and Terry-Thomas.{{sfn|Dimmitt|1967|p=51}}{{sfn|Castell|1984|p=120}} He was also active in television during the course of the year, appearing in a number of episodes of ''[[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Presents<U+200E>]]'' in a variety of roles.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=308}}

[[File:Dad's Army cast - 1971.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Le Mesurier (second from left) with the cast of ''[[Dad's Army]]'', from the 1971 Christmas Special ''[[Battle of the Giants!]]''.]]

Le Mesurier was offered a role in a new BBC [[sitcom|situation comedy]] in 1968, playing the part of the upper-class [[Sergeant Arthur Wilson]] in ''[[Dad's Army]]'',{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=208}} although he was the second choice for the role behind [[Robert Dorning]].{{sfn|McCann|2001|p=56}} Le Mesurier was unsure about taking the role, as he was finishing the final series of ''George and the Dragon'', and did not want another long-term television role,{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=209}} but was reassured by both a rise in his fee<U+2014>to <U+00A3>262&nbsp;10s (<U+00A3>262.50) per episode<U+2014>and when his old friend [[Clive Dunn]] was cast in the part of [[Corporal Jones]].{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=214}} Le Mesurier was initially unsure of how to play the part and asked writer [[Jimmy Perry]] for advice: he was told to play it how he wanted.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=217}} Le Mesurier decided to base the character on himself, later writing that "I thought, why not just be myself, use an extension of my own personality and behave rather as I had done in the army? So I always left a button or two undone, and had the sleeve of my battle dress slightly turned up. I spoke softly, issues commands as if they were invitations (the sort not likely to be accepted) and generally assumed a benign air of helplessness".{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1984|p=118}} Perry later observed that "we wanted Wilson to be the voice of sanity; he has become John".<ref name="Guardian: the breed" />

[[Nicholas de Jongh]] noted that it was in the role of Wilson that Le Mesurier "became a star".<ref name="Guardian: star dies" /> His relationship with Arthur Lowe's character [[Captain George Mainwaring]] was described in ''The Times'' as "a memorable part of one of television's most popular shows".<ref name="Times Obit" /> Tise Vahimagi, writing for the [[British Film Institute]]'s [[Screenonline]], agreed and commented that "it was the hesitant exchanges of one-upmanship between Le Mesurier's Wilson, a figure of delicate gentility, and Arthur Lowe's pompous, middle-class platoon leader Captain Mainwaring that added to its finest moments."<ref name="BFI: Le Mez" /> Le Mesurier enjoyed making the series, particularly the fortnight the cast would spend in [[Thetford]] filming the outside scenes.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=245}} The programme lasted for nine series over nine years, and covered eighty episodes, ending in 1977.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=257}} 

During the course of filming the series in 1969 Le Mesurier was flown to Venice over a series of weekends for filming ''[[Midas Run]]'', an [[Alf Kjellin]]-directed crime film that also starred [[Richard Crenna]], [[Anne Heywood]] and [[Fred Astaire]].<ref name="BFI: Midas Run" />{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1984|p=134}} Le Mesurier became friends with Astaire during the filming and the two would dine together in a local cafe while watching the horse racing on television.{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1984|p=137}} In 1971 a feature film was made [[Dad's Army (film)|of the same name]], under the helm of director [[Norman Cohen]].{{sfn|Slide|1996|p=151}} A play was written, which toured around the UK between the summer of 1975 and August 1976.{{sfn|Pertwee|2009|p=165}} Following the success of ''Dad's Army'', Le Mesurier recorded the single "[[A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square (song)|A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square]]" / "Hometown" (the latter with [[Arthur Lowe]]), as well as an album, a cast recording of ''Dad's Army''; both were released on the Warner label in 1975.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=311}}

In between the annual filming of the series Le Mesurier continued to appear in films, including a role as the prison Governor opposite [[No<U+00EB>l Coward ]] in the 1969 [[Peter Collinson (film director)|Peter Collinson]]-directed film ''[[The Italian Job]]''.<ref name="BFI: The Italian Job" /> In 1970, Le Mesurier appeared in Ralph Thomas's ''[[Doctor in Trouble]]'' as the Purser;{{sfn|Halliwell|1994|p=304}} he also made an appearance in [[Vincente Minnelli]]'s ''[[On a Clear Day You Can See Forever (film)|On a Clear Day You Can See Forever]]'', a [[romantic fantasy]] [[Musical film|musical]] with a [[screenplay]] by [[Alan Jay Lerner]] adapted from his [[Libretto|book]] for the [[On a Clear Day You Can See Forever|1965 stage production of the same name]], featuring [[Barbra Streisand]] in the main role.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=311}} 

He gave a memorable performance in [[Dennis Potter]]'s 1971 play ''[[Traitor (TV drama)|Traitor]]'', in which he portrayed a "boozy British aristocrat who became a spy for the Soviets";<ref name="Roberts2009">{{cite book|author=Jerry Roberts|title=Encyclopedia of Television Film Directors|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YB6tyFdq5TcC&pg=PA60|accessdate=24 August 2012|date=15 June 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6138-1|page=60}}</ref> his performance won him a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] "Best Television Actor" award.<ref name="traitor" /> Writing for the British Film Institute, Sergio Angelini judged that "Le Mesurier is utterly compelling throughout in an atypical role".<ref name="BFI: Traitor" /> Chris Dunkley, writing in ''The Times'' considered that "it was a superbly persuasive portrait, made vividly real by one of the best performances Mr Mesurier {{sic}} has ever given".<ref name="Times: Traitor" /> The reviewer for ''The Sunday Times'' agreed, saying that Le Mesurier, "after a lifetime supporting other actors with the strength of a pit-prop, gets the main part; he looks, sounds and feels exactly right."<ref name="S Times: Traitor" /> Reviewing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Nancy Banks-Smith]] called the role "his [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]", going on to say that it "was worth waiting for"';<ref name="Guardian: Traitor" /> Mary Holland, writing in ''The Guardian''{{'}}s sister paper, ''[[The Observer]]'', noted that it was "a part at last worthy of his considerable serious talents".<ref name="Observer: Traitor" /> Although delighted to have won the award, Le Mesurier commented that, "The sequel was someting of an anticlimax. No exciting offers of work cane in".{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1984|p=127}}

In 1972 Le Mesurier made a cameo appearance in [[Val Guest]]'s sex comedy ''[[Au Pair Girls]]'' and he starred alongside [[Warren Mitchell]], [[Dandy Nichols]], [[Paul Angelis]] and [[Adrienne Posta]] [[Bob Kellett]]'s ''[[The Alf Garnett Saga]]''.<ref name="BFI: Alf Garnett Saga" /> In 1974, Le Mesurier played an inspector in another Val Guest sex comedy, ''[[Confessions of a Window Cleaner]]'', opposite [[Robin Askwith]] and [[Antony Booth]].{{sfn|Halliwell|1994|p=231}} He also had a small part in the Anglo-Italian production ''[[Brief Encounter (1974 film)|Brief Encounter]]'', featuring [[Richard Burton]] and [[Sophia Loren]] in the main roles,<ref name="BFI: Brief Encounter" /> which was part of the ''[[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]'' series on the American [[NBC]] channel.<ref name="BFI: Brief Encounter, trans" />

In 1975 Le Mesurier appeared opposite [[Adrienne Posta]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], [[Paul Nicholas]], [[Edward Woodward]], and [[Richard Beckinsdale]] in [[Martin Campbell]]'s ''[[Three for All]]'', a comedy film about a British [[music group]] and their girlfriends, who go to Spain to make a record.{{sfn|Pym|2004|p=1316}} He also made an appearance in [[Gene Wilder]]'s debut directorial film, ''[[The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother]]''.{{sfn|Pym|2004|p=11}} That year, Le Mesurier also narrated ''[[Bod (series)|Bod]]'', an animated children's programme from the BBC; there were thirteen episodes in total.<ref name="Independent: Bod" />

====1977<U+2013>83====
In 1977, Le Mesurier starred opposite [[Michael Palin]] and [[Harry H. Corbett]] in the [[Terry Gilliam]]-directed ''[[Jabberwocky (film)|Jabberwocky]]''. The film was poorly received by critics and the public at the time.<ref name="Simon: New York" /> He also played a colonel, alongside [[Robin Askwith]], [[Nigel Davenport]] and [[George Layton]], in ''[[Stand Up, Virgin Soldiers]]'', which was the sequel to the 1969 film ''[[The Virgin Soldiers (film)|The Virgin Soldiers]]''.{{sfn|Nowlan|Wright Nowlan|1989|p=811}} Later that year he also portrayed [[Jacob Marley]] in a 1977 BBC television adaptation of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', which starred [[Michael Hordern]] as [[Ebeneezer Scrooge|Scrooge]];<ref name="BFI: Christmas Carol" /> Sergio Angelini, writing for the British Film Institute considered that "although never frightening, he does exert a strong sense of melancholy, his every move and inflection seemingly tinged with regret and remorse".<ref name="BFI: Christmas Carol" />

In 1978 Le Mesurier played Sir Archibald MacGregor in the sex comedy, ''[[Rosie Dixon <U+2013> Night Nurse]]'',{{sfn|Mustazza|2006|p=106}} and had a small role as Doctor Deere in the [[Ted Kotcheff]]-directed mystery comedy film, ''[[Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?]]''.<ref name="BFI: Cast: Great Chefs of Europe" /> In 1979 he portrayed Sir Gawain in [[Walt Disney]]'s film adaptation of [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'', ''[[Unidentified Flying Oddball]]'', directed by [[Russ Mayberry]], and co-starring [[Dennis Dugan]], [[Jim Dale]], [[Ron Moody]] and [[Kenneth More]].{{sfn|Umland|Umland|1996|p=188}} ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' praised it as "an intelligent film with a cohesive plot and an amusing script" and cited it as "one of the better Disney attempts to hop on the sci-fi bandwagon".<ref name="TO: King Arthur's Court" /> They praised the cast, particularly Kenneth More's Arthur and Le Mesurier's Gawain, which they said are "rather touchingly portrayed as friends who have grown old together".<ref name="TO: King Arthur's Court" /> 

In January 1980 Le Mesurier played [[The Wise Old Bird]] in the [[BBC Radio 4]] adaptation ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' and appeared on the same channel as [[Bilbo Baggins]] in the [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|1981 radio version]] of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=287}} He also reprised the role of Arthur Wilson in ''[[It Sticks Out Half a Mile]]'', a radio sequel to ''Dad's Army'', in which Wilson had become manager of the Warmington branch, while [[Arthur Lowe]]'s character, [[Captain George Mainwaring]] was trying to apply for a loan to renovate the local pier. The death of Lowe in April 1982 meant that only a pilot episode was recorded, and the project was stopped.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=290}} It was later revived with Lowe's role replaced by two other ''Dad's Army'' cast members: [[Private Frank Pike|Pike]], played by [[Ian Lavender]] and [[List of Dad's Army characters#ARP Warden William Hodges|Hodges]], played by [[Bill Pertwee]]. A pilot and twelve episodes were subsequently recorded,{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=292}} and broadcast in 1984.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=308}} Le Mesurier also teamed up with another ex-''Dad's Army'' colleague, [[Clive Dunn]], to record a novelty single, "There Ain't Much Change from a Pound These Days" / "After All These Years", which had been written by Le Mesurier's step-son, David Malin.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=290}} The single was released on KA Records in 1982.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=311}}

In the spring of 1980 he appeared as Simon Bliss alongside [[Constance Cummings]]<U+2014>as Sorel Bliss<U+2014>in a production of [[No<U+00EB>l Coward]]'s 1920s play ''[[Hay Fever]]''.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=283}}<ref name="Observer: Hay Fever" /> Writing for ''The Observer'', Robert Cushman thought that Le Mesurier played the role with "deeply grizzled torpor",<ref name="Observer: Hay Fever" /> while [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]], reviewing for ''The Guardian'' saw him as a "grey, gentle wisp of a man, full of half-completed gestures and seraphic smiles".<ref name="Guardian: Hay Fever" />

In 1981 Le Mesurier played Father Mowbray in [[ITV Granada| Granada Television's]] adaptation of ''[[Brideshead Revisited (TV serial)|Brideshead Revisited]]''<ref name="BFI: Cast: Brideshead" /> and guest starred in episodes of the British comedy television series ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', and an early episode of ''[[Hi-de-Hi!]]''.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=310}} His final film appearance was with [[Peter Sellers]] in the 1980 film ''[[The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu]]'', which was also Sellers's last film before his death in July 1980.{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=245}} Le Mesurier also narrated the short film ''[[The Passionate Pilgrim (film)|The Passionate Pilgrim]]'', an [[Eric Morecambe]] film, which was Morecambe's last film before he died in May 1984.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=294}}

===Personal life===

[[Image:Lemesurier.png|right|frame|Self-penned death notice in ''The Times'' from 16 November 1983]]

In 1939 Le Mesurier accepted a role in the [[Robert Morley]] play ''Goodness, How Sad!''; the play was directed by June Melville<U+2014>whose father Frederick owned a number of theatres, including the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum]], [[Shaftesbury Theatre|Prince's]] and Brixton.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=83}} The two soon began a romance, and were married in April 1940.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=86}} While Le Mesurier was undergoing his [[Recruit training|basic training]], having been [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|conscripted]] in September 1940, Melville would visit and le Mesurier noticed that she drank heavily. He later noted that, "what had seemed no more than high spirits in the social whirl of London theatre not infrequently became boorish in what was now for me a more restrained environment."{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1984|p=48}} After his demobilisation in 1946, Le Mesurier noticed that his wife's drinking had worsened while he had been serving abroad, saying, "she became careless on appointments and haphazard professionally".{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1984|p=62}} The couple separated as a result of her drinking, and the marriage was dissolved in 1949.<ref name="Nimmo (DNB)" />{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=114}}

In June 1947 Le Mesurier went with fellow actor Geoffrey Hibbert to the [[Players' Theatre]] in London, where among the performers was [[Hattie Jacques]].{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=107}} The two began to see each other regularly, although Le Mesurier was still married, albeit estranged from his wife.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=114}} In 1949, when his divorce came through, Jacques proposed to Le Mesurier, asking him, "don't you think it's about time we got married?".{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1984|p=74}} The couple married in November 1949;{{sfn|Merriman|2007|p=60}}<ref>General Register Office, ''England and Wales Civil Registration Indexes'', volume 5c, p. 2328.</ref> they had two sons: Robin (born 23 March 1953) and Kim (1956<U+2013>1991).{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=123}} 

In 1962 Jacques began an affair with her driver, John Schofield, after he gave her the attention and support that Le Mesurier did not.{{sfn|Merriman|2007|pp=122<U+2013>123}} When Jacques decided to move Schofield into the family home, Le Mesurier moved into a separate room and tried to repair the marriage.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=162}} He later commented about this period that, "I could have walked out, but, whatever my feelings, I loved Hattie and the children and I was certain<U+2014>I had to be certain<U+2014>that we could repair the damage."{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1984|pp=86-87}} The affair caused a downturn in his health and he collapsed on holiday in Tangiers, before being hospitalised in Gibraltar;{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=165}} he returned to London to find the situation between his wife and her lover was unchanged and he had a further relapse.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=166}}
[[File:John Le Mesurier - geograph 2847147.jpg|thumb|left|The grave of Le Mesurier at St. George's church, Ramsgate]]
In 1963, during the final stages of the breakdown of his marriage, Le Mesurier met [[Joan Le Mesurier|Joan Malin]] at [[The Establishment (club)|The Establishment]] club in Soho.{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1988|p=96}} In 1964 Le Mesurier eventually moved out of his marital house and, on the day he moved in, proposed to Joan, who accepted.{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1988|pp=69<U+2013>70}} During the divorce proceedings between Le Mesurier and Jacques, he allowed Jacques to bring the suit on grounds of Le Mesurier's infidelity to ensure that the press blamed him for the break-up, thus avoiding any negative publicity for her.{{sfn|Merriman|2007|p=136}} Le Mesurier and Malin married in March 1966.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=180}}<ref>General Register Office, ''England and Wales Civil Registration Indexes'', volume 5b, p. 1040.</ref> A few months after they were married, Joan began a relationship with Le Mesurier's close friend Tony Hancock,{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=183}} and left Le Mesurier to move in with the comedian.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=186}} Hancock was a self-confessed alcoholic by the time the affair started{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1988|p=76}} and was also verbally and physically abusive to Joan during their relationship.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=187}} After a year together, during which time she had attempted to commit suicide, and with Hancock's violence towards her worsening, Joan realised that she could no longer live with him and returned to Le Mesurier.{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1988|pp=140-141}} Le Mesurier remained friends with Hancock, calling him "a comic of true genius, capable of great warmth and generosity, but a tormented and unhappy man".{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1984|p=111}}

In his private life, Le Mesurier was a heavy drinker and was often seen with a drink in his hand but never noticeably drunk. In 1977 he collapsed in Australia and flew home to the UK, where he was diagnosed with [[cirrhosis]] of the liver, and was ordered to stop drinking.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=262}} Until his collapse he had not considered himself an alcoholic, although he noted that "it was the cumulative effect over the years that had done the damage.{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1988|p=144}} It was a year and a half before he drank alcohol again, and reverted only to beer, eschewing spirits.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=277}} Jacques claimed that his calculated vagueness was the result of his "reliance on [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]",<ref name="Lewis (2007)" /> although Le Mesurier stated that he only smoked the drug while undergoing his period of abstinence, claiming that it was not to his taste.{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1984|p=156}} Le Mesurier's favoured pastime was visiting the jazz clubs around Soho, such as The Establishment or [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club|Ronnie Scott's]] and he noted that "Listening to artists like [[Bill Evans]], [[Oscar Peterson]] or [[Alan Clare]] always made life seem that little bit brighter".{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1984|p=111}}

Towards the end of his life Le Mesurier wrote his autobiography, ''A Jobbing Actor''; the book was published in 1984, after his death.{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=302}} Le Mesurier's health visibly declined from July 1983 when he was hospitalised for a short time when he began to [[haemorrhage]].{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=294}} The condition reoccurred later in the year and he was taken to Ramsgate Hospital;{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1988|p=189}} after saying to his wife, "It's all been rather lovely", he slipped into a coma{{sfn|McCann|2010|p=298}} and died on 15 November 1983, aged 71 from a stomach haemorrhage.<ref>General Register Office, ''England and Wales Civil Registration Indexes'', volume 16, p. 1890.</ref> He was buried at the Church of St. George the Martyr, Church Hill, Ramsgate. His [[epitaph]] reads: "John Le Mesurier. Beloved actor. Resting."<ref name="Farndale (2008)" /> His self-penned death notice in ''[[The Times]]'' of 16 November 1983 stated that he had "conked out" and that he "sadly misses family and friends".<ref name="Times conked out"/> 

After Le Mesurier's death fellow comedian [[Eric Sykes]] commented that, "I never heard a bad word said against him. He was one of the great drolls of our time";<ref name="Mirror: Conked out" /> his fellow ''Dad's Army'' actor Bill Pertwee mourned the loss of his friend, saying, "It's a shattering loss. He was a great professional, very quiet but with a lovely sense of humour".<ref name="Mirror: Conked out" /> Director [[Peter Cotes]], writing in '' The Guardian'' called him one of Britain's "most accomplished screen character actors",<ref name="Guardian Obit" /> while ''The Times'' observed that he "could lend distinction to the smallest part".<ref name="Times Obit" />

''The Guardian'' reflected on Le Mesurier's popularity observing that "No wonder so many whose lives were very different from his own came to be so enormously fond of him".<ref name="Guardian: 2nd row" /> A memorial service was held for Le Mesurier on 16 February 1984 at the Actors' Church, [[St Paul's, Covent Garden]]. Fellow ''Dad's Army'' cast member Bill Pertwee gave an address.<ref name="Times: Memorial" />

==Approach to acting==
{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=The character he cumulatively created will be remembered when others more famous are forgotten, not just for the skill of his playing but because he somehow embodied a symbolic British reaction to the whirlpool of the modern world<U+2014>endlessly perplexed by the dizzying and incoherent pattern of event, but doing his best to ensure that resentment never showed.|source=<U+2014>''[[The Guardian]]'', 16 November 1983.<ref name="Guardian: 2nd row" />|salign =right }}

Le Mesurier took a relaxed approach to acting, saying, "You know the way you get jobbing gardeners? Well, I'm a jobbing actor&nbsp;... as long as they pay me I couldn't care less if my name is billed above or below the title".<ref name="Guardian: star dies" /> Although Le Mesurier played a wide range of parts, he became known for playing "an indispensable figure in the gallery of second-rank players which were the glory of the British film industry in its more prolific days".<ref name="Nimmo (DNB)" /> He felt his characterisations owed "a lot to my customary expression of bewildered innocence"{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1984|p=72}} and tried to stress for many of his roles that his parts were those of "a decent chap all at sea in a chaotic world not of his own making".{{sfn|Le Mesurier|1984|p=72}}

[[Philip French]] of ''The Observer'' considered that while playing a representative of bureaucracy Le Mesurier "registered something&nbsp;... complex. A feeling of exasperation, disturbance, anxiety [that] constantly lurked behind that handsome bloodhound face".<ref name="Observer: Mesurier's multitude" /> The impression he gave in these roles became an "inimitable brand of bewildered persistence under fire which Le Mesurier made his own".<ref name="Guardian: 2nd row" /> ''The Times'' noted of him that although he was best known for his comedic roles, he, "could be equally effective in straight parts", as evidenced by his BAFTA-award winning role in ''Traitor''.<ref name="Times Obit" /> Director [[Peter Cotes]] agreed, adding, "he had depths unrealised through the mechanical pieces in which he generally appeared";<ref name="Guardian Obit" /> while [[Philip Oakes]] considered that, "single-handed, he has made more films watchable, even absorbing than anyone else around".<ref name="S Times: Worrier" />

==Portrayals==
Le Mesurier's second and third marriages have been the subject of two [[BBC Four]] biographical films, the 2008 ''[[Hancock and Joan]]'' on Joan Le Mesurier's affair with Tony Hancock<U+2014>with Le Mesurier played by [[Alex Jennings]]<ref name="BBC: Hancock and Joan" /><U+2014>and the 2011 ''[[Hattie (television film)|Hattie]]'' on Jacques's affair with John Schofield<U+2014>with Le Mesurier played by [[Robert Bathurst]].<ref name="BBC: Hattie" />
