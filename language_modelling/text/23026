The '''Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS&WR)''', also known as the '''Bakerloo tube''', was a railway company established in 1893 that constructed a deep-level underground "tube" railway in London.<ref name="tubedefinition">A "tube" railway is an underground railway constructed in a cylindrical tunnel by the use of a [[tunnelling shield]], usually deep below ground level.</ref> Although construction began in 1898, the company struggled to fund the work and was then hit by the financial collapse in 1900 of its  parent company, the London & Globe Finance Corporation, through the fraud of its main shareholder, [[Whitaker Wright]]. In 1902, it became a subsidiary of the [[Underground Electric Railways Company|Underground Electric Railways Company of London Limited]] (UERL) controlled by American financier [[Charles Yerkes]]. The UERL quickly raised the funds, mainly from foreign investors.

When opened in 1906, the BS&WR's line served nine stations and ran completely underground in a pair of tunnels for {{convert|5.81|km|mi|abbr=off|2}} between its northern terminus at [[Baker Street]] and its southern terminus at [[Elephant and Castle]] with a depot on a short spur nearby at London Road.<ref name="dist">Length of line calculated from distances given at

In 1915, it was further extended to [[Queen's Park station|Queen's Park]] where it connected to the [[London and North Western Railway|London & North Western Railway]] (LNWR) to run on the surface to [[Willesden Junction station|Willesden Junction]] and, from 1917, to [[Watford]], covering a total distance of {{convert|33.34|km|mi|2}}.<ref name="dist"/>

Within the first year of opening it became apparent to the management and investors that the estimated passenger numbers for the BS&WR and the other UERL lines were over-optimistic. Despite improved integration and cooperation with the other tube railways and the later extensions, the BS&WR struggled financially.  In 1933, it and the rest of the UERL were taken into [[public ownership]]. Today, the BS&WR's tunnels and stations operate as the [[London Underground]]'s [[Bakerloo line]].

In November 1891, notice was given of a [[Local and Personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|private bill]] that would be presented to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] for the construction of the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS&WR).<ref name="LG_01">{{LondonGazette

From Baker Street, the route was to run eastwards beneath [[Marylebone Road]], then curve to the south under [[Park Crescent, London|Park Crescent]] and follow [[Portland Place]], Langham Place and [[Regent Street]] to [[Piccadilly Circus]]. It was then to run under [[Haymarket (London)|Haymarket]], [[Trafalgar Square]] and [[Northumberland Avenue]] before passing under the [[River Thames]] to Waterloo station. A decision had not been made between the use of cable haulage or electric traction as the means of pulling the trains.<ref name="LG_01"/> The promoters of the BS&WR were motivated by the recent success of the [[City and South London Railway]] (C&SLR), the world's first deep-tube railway.<ref name="motivation">[[#Reference-badsey|Badsey-Ellis 2005]], p. 53.</ref> This had opened in November 1890 and had seen large passenger numbers in its first year of operation.<ref name="SubRail_01">In its first year of operation the C&SLR carried 5.1&nbsp;million passengers &ndash; [[#Reference-wolmar|Wolmar 2004]], p. 321.</ref> One of the benefits put forward by the railway company was its use by [[West End of London|West End]] businessmen as a way to get quickly to [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] north of Baker Street after work for the last hour of play.<ref name="cricket">[[#Reference-wolmar|Wolmar 2004]], p. 167.</ref><ref name="review"/> 

Bills for three similarly inspired new underground railways were also submitted to Parliament for the 1892 [[parliamentary session]], and, to ensure a consistent approach, a [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Joint Select Committee]] was established to review the proposals. The committee took evidence on various matters regarding the construction and operation of deep-tube railways, and made recommendations on the diameter of tube tunnels, method of traction, and the granting of [[easement|wayleaves]]. After rejecting the construction of stations on land owned by the [[Crown Estate]] and the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 6th Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]] between [[Oxford Circus]] and Baker Street, the Committee allowed the BS&WR bill to proceed for normal parliamentary consideration.<ref name="review">[[#Reference-badsey|Badsey-Ellis 2005]], p. 56.</ref>

While the BS&WR raised money, it continued to develop the plans for its route. The November 1895 bill sought powers to modify the planned route of the tunnels at the Baker Street end of the line and extend them approximately {{convert|200|m|ft}} beyond their previous end point at the south-eastern corner of Dorset Square to the south-eastern corner of Harewood Square.<ref name="LG_03"/> Harewood Square was to be the site of [[Marylebone station]], the new London terminus of the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]]'s extension from [[English Midlands|the Midlands]] then under construction.<ref name="review"/> Approval for the extension and a new station at [[Marylebone tube station|Marylebone]] were included in the ''Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1896''.<ref name="review"/><ref name="1896_Act"/>

====New Cross & Waterloo Railway bill, 1898====
On 26 November 1897, details of a bill proposed for the 1898 parliamentary session were published by the New Cross and Waterloo Railway (NC&WR), an independent company promoted by [[Sir James Heath, 1st Baronet|James Heath]] MP, which planned two separate sections of tube line which would connect directly to the BS&WR; extending the line south-east from Waterloo and east from around Marylebone Road.<ref name="NC&WR_bill">

The southern of the NC&WR's two extensions was planned to connect to the BS&WR tunnels under Belvedere Road to the west of Waterloo station and head east under the mainline station to its own station under Sandell Street adjacent to [[Waterloo East railway station|Waterloo East station]]. The route was then planned to run under [[Waterloo Road, London|Waterloo Road]], [[St George's Circus]] and [[London Road, Southwark|London Road]] to [[Elephant and Castle]]. The route then followed [[New Kent Road]] and [[Old Kent Road]] as far as the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]]'s [[Old Kent Road railway station|Old Kent Road station]] (closed in 1917). Intermediate stations were to be constructed at St George's Circus, Elephant and Castle (where the NC&WR station would interchange with the [[Elephant & Castle tube station|C&SLR's station]] below ground and link to the [[Elephant & Castle railway station|London, Chatham and Dover Railway's station]] above ground), in New Kent Road at Munton Road, at the junction of New Kent Road and Old Kent Road, and on Old Kent Road at the junctions with Mina Road, Bowles Road and Commercial Road (now Commercial Way). A power station was planned on the south side of Old Kent Road where it crossed the [[Grand Surrey Canal]] (now filled-in) at the junction with St James's Road. This would have provided a delivery route for fuel and a source of water. Tunnels were also planned to connect the BS&WR's proposed depot at Waterloo to the NC&WR's route enabling trains to enter and exit in two directions.<ref name="NC&WR"/>

The NC&WR's other planned extension was to branch from the BS&WR's curve under Park Crescent. It was then to curve eastwards under [[Regent's Park]] and then run under Longford Street and [[Drummond Street, London|Drummond Street]] to end at a station on the west side of Seymour Street (now Eversholt Street) under [[Euston railway station|Euston station]]. An intermediate station was planned for the junction of Drummond Street and Hampstead Road.<ref name="NC&WR"/>

The bill was deposited in Parliament, but no progress was made in the 1898 session and it disappeared afterwards, although the BS&WR presented a modified version of the Euston branch in a bill for the 1899 session.<ref name="NC&WR"/><ref name="1899_bill">[[#Reference-badsey|Badsey-Ellis 2005]], p. 84.</ref>

The route then followed Cumberland Street West (now Nash Street), [[Cumberland Market]], Cumberland Street East and Edward Street (both now Varndell Street), before ending at a station under Cardington Street on the west side of Euston station.<ref name="1899_bill"/>

The second extension was to continue the line west from Marylebone; running under Great James Street and Bell Street (now both Bell Street) to Corlett Street then turning south to reach the [[Grand Junction Canal]]'s [[Paddington Basin]] to the east of the [[Great Western Railway|GWR's]] [[London Paddington station|Paddington station]]. A station was to be located directly under the east-west arm of the basin before the line turned north-west, running between the mainline station and the basin, before the two tunnels merged into one. The single tunnel was then to turn north-east, passing under the [[Regent's Canal]] to the east of [[Maida Vale#Little Venice|Little Venice]], before coming to the surface where a depot was to be built on the north side of Blomfield Road. The BS&WR also planned a power station at Paddington. The final change to the route was a modification at Waterloo to move the last section of the line southwards to end under Addington Street.<ref name="1899_bill"/>

Occasionally air escaped through the river bed causing water spouts in the river.<ref name="start"/> The tunnel linings were formed from cast iron segments <U+215E> inch (2.22&nbsp;cm) thick, which locked together to form a ring with an internal diameter of {{convert|12|ft|m|2}}. Once a ring was completed, [[grout]] was injected through holes in the segments to fill any voids between the outside edge of the ring and the excavated ground beyond, reducing [[subsidence]].<ref name="review"/>

By November 1899 the northbound tunnel had reached Trafalgar Square and work on some of the station sites had been started, but the collapse of the L&GFC in 1900 led to works gradually coming to a halt. When the UERL was constituted in April 1902, 50 per cent of the tunnelling and 25 per cent of the station work had been completed.<ref name="progress_02">{{cite journal|date=10 April 1902 |title=The Underground Electric Railways Company Of London (Limited)|journal=[[The Times]]|issue=36738|pages=12|url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/393/804/42116361w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS201779850&dyn=13!xrn_31_0_CS201779850&hst_1?|accessdate=2009-11-07}}</ref> With funds in place, work restarted and proceeded at a rate of {{convert|73|ft|m|2}} per week,<ref name="stop"/> so that by February 1904 virtually all of the tunnels and underground parts of the stations between Elephant & Castle and Marylebone were complete and works on the station buildings were under way.<ref name="progress_04">{{cite journal|date=17 February 1904 |title=Railway And Other Companies - Baker Street and Waterloo Railway|journal=[[The Times]]|issue=37319|pages=14|url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/393/804/42116361w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS235204177&dyn=21!xrn_4_0_CS235204177&hst_1?|accessdate=2009-11-07}}</ref> The additional stations were incorporated as work continued elsewhere and Oxford Circus station had to be altered below ground following a [[Board of Trade]] inspection, but, at the end of 1905, the first test trains began running on the system.<ref name="testing">[[#Reference-wolmar|Wolmar 2004]], p. 173.</ref> Although the BS&WR had permission to continue to Paddington, no work was undertaken beyond Edgware Road.<ref name="paddnot">[[#Reference-horne|Horne 2001]], p. 20.</ref>

The BS&WR used a [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] automatic signalling system operated through electrified [[track circuit]]s. This controlled signals based on the presence or absence of a train on the track ahead. Signals incorporated an arm that was raised when the signal was red. If a train failed to stop at a red signal, the arm would activate a "[[train stop|tripcock]]" on the train; applying the brakes automatically.<ref name="signals">[[#Reference-horne|Horne 2001]], p. 19.</ref>

While construction was being finished, trains operated out of service beyond Baker Street; reversing at a [[Railroad switch#Crossover|cross over]] to the east of the station under construction at Marylebone.<ref name="signals"/>

The service was provided by a fleet of 108 [[Coach (rail)|carriages]] manufactured for the UERL in the United States by the [[American Car and Foundry Company]] and assembled in Manchester. The carriages operated as [[electric multiple unit]] trains without the need for separate locomotives.<ref name="trains">[[#Reference-horne|Horne 2001]], pp. 12-13.</ref> Passengers boarded and left the trains through folding lattice gates at each end of cars; these gates were operated by Gate-men who rode on an outside platform and announced station names as trains arrived.<ref name="gate-men">[[#Reference-day|Day & Reed 2008]], p. 70.</ref> The design was subsequently used for the GNP&BR and the CCE&HR, and became known on the Underground as the [[London Underground 1906 Stock|1906 stock]] or [[London Underground 1906 Stock|Gate stock]]. Trains for the line were stabled at the London Road depot south of Kennington Road station.<ref name="depot"> Trains entered service by running north into Kennington Road station.</ref>

==Co-operation and consolidation, 1906&ndash;1910==
Despite the UERL's success in financing and constructing the railway, its opening did not bring the financial success that had been expected. In the Bakerloo Tube's first twelve months of operation it carried 20.5&nbsp;million passengers, less than sixty per cent of the 35&nbsp;million that had been predicted during the planning of the line.<ref name="passengers">[[#Reference-wolmar|Wolmar 2004]], p. 191.</ref> The UERL's pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be similarly over-optimistic, as did the projected figures for the newly electrified MDR &ndash; in each case, numbers achieved only around fifty per cent of their targets.<ref name="passengers2">The UERL had predicted 60&nbsp;million passengers for the GNP&BR and 50&nbsp;million for the CCE&HR in their first year of operation, but achieved 26 and 25&nbsp;million respectively. For the MDR it had predicted an increase to 100&nbsp;million passengers after electrification, but achieved 55&nbsp;million &ndash; [[#Reference-wolmar|Wolmar 2004]], p. 191.</ref> 

The lower than expected passenger numbers were partly due to competition between the tube and sub-surface railway companies, but the introduction of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took a large number of passengers away from the trains. The problem was not limited to the UERL; all of London's seven tube lines and the sub-surface MDR and Metropolitan Railway were affected to some degree. The reduced revenues generated from the lower passenger numbers made it difficult for the UERL and the other railways to pay back the capital borrowed, or to pay dividends to shareholders.<ref name="Lost_Tubes_12">[[#Reference-badsey|Badsey-Ellis 2005]], pp. 282<U+2013>283.</ref> 

From 1907, in an effort to improve their finances, the UERL, the C&SLR, the CLR and the GN&CR began to introduce fare agreements. From 1908, they began to present themselves through common branding as the ''Underground''.<ref name="Lost_Tubes_12"/> The W&CR was the only tube railway that did not participate in the arrangement as it was owned by the mainline L&SWR.<ref name="NoW&CR">[[#Reference-horne|Horne 2001]], p. 23.</ref> 

The UERL's three tube railway companies were still legally separate entities, with their own management, shareholder and dividend structures. There was duplicated administration between the three companies and, to streamline the management and reduce expenditure, the UERL announced a bill in November 1909 that would merge the Bakerloo, the Hampstead and the Piccadilly Tubes into a single entity, the London Electric Railway (LER), although the lines retained their own individual branding.<ref name="merge">

In 1908, the Bakerloo Tube attempted to make the hoped for extension into north-west London using the existing powers of the [[North West London Railway]] (NWLR), an unbuilt tube railway with permission to build a line from [[Cricklewood]] to [[London Victoria station|Victoria station]].<ref name="NWLR">[[#Reference-badsey|Badsey-Ellis 2005]], pp. 264-267.</ref> The NWLR announced a bill in November 1908 seeking to construct a {{convert|757|m|ft}} connection between its unbuilt route beneath the [[Edgware Road, London|Edgware Road]] and the Bakerloo Tube's Edgware Road station.<ref name="1909_bill_NWLR">

Parliament rejected the proposed connection and the changes to the NWLR's route and the company's permissions eventually expired without any construction work being carried out.

===Queen's Park and Watford, 1911&ndash;1917===
In 1907, the [[London and North Western Railway|LNWR]] obtained parliamentary permission to improve its mainline services into London by the construction of a pair of new, electrified tracks alongside its existing line between [[Watford Junction railway station|Watford Junction]] in Hertfordshire and [[Queen's Park station|Queen's Park]], Kilburn and a new tube section beneath its lines from there to its terminus at [[Euston railway station|Euston]]. At Euston, the tube tunnel was to end with an underground station located on a {{convert|1450|m|ft|adj=on}} long loop beneath the mainline station.<ref name="Watford">[[#Reference-badsey|Badsey-Ellis 2005]], pp. 268-270.</ref> 

The LNWR began construction work on the surface section of the new tracks in 1909.<ref name="Watford2">[[#Reference-horne|Horne 2001]], p. 27.</ref>  By 1911, it had modified the plans to omit the underground section and to split its proposed electrified services into three. The first section was to follow the existing surface route into Euston on newly electrified tracks, the second section was to connect to the North London Railway's tracks at [[Chalk Farm]] and continue on electrified tracks from there to [[Broad Street railway station (London)|Broad Street station]] in the [[City of London]]. The third section involved the extension of the Bakerloo Tube from Paddington to Queen's Park.<ref name="Watford"/>

Progress on the section from Paddington to Queen's Park was slowed by the start of [[World War I]], so the line was not finished until early 1915.<ref name="escalate"/> As at Paddington, the three below ground stations were built to use escalators. Maida Vale and Kilburn Park were provided with buildings in the style of the earlier Leslie Green stations but without the upper storey; no longer required for housing lift gear.

For the extension to Queen's Park, the LER supplemented the existing rolling stock with 14 new carriages ordered from [[Brush Traction]] and [[Leeds Forge Company]] plus spare Gate stock carriages from the GNP&BR. These carriages, the [[London Underground 1914 Stock|1914 stock]], were the first to have doors in the sides of the carriages as well as the ends.<ref name="QP"/> For the longer extension to Watford, the LER and the LNWR ordered 72 new tube carriages from the [[Metro Cammell|Metropolitan Railway Carriage and Wagon Company]]. Manufacture of this rolling stock was delayed by the war, and, while it was waiting delivery, the Bakerloo Tube used spare [[London Underground 1915 Stock|1915 stock]] carriages ordered for an unfinished extension of the CLR to [[Ealing Broadway station|Ealing Broadway]] and more spare Gate stock carriages from the GNP&BR.<ref name="new lines"/> Delivery of the carriages for the Watford service, known as the [[London Underground Watford Joint Stock|Watford Joint stock]] because ownership was shared between with the LNWR, began in 1920; they were painted in the LNWR's livery to distinguish them from trains operating only on the Bakerloo Tube's tracks.<ref name="new trains">[[#Reference-horne|Horne 2001]], p. 37.</ref>

===Camberwell and south-east London===
The southern termination of the line at Elephant & Castle always presented the opportunity for the line to be extended further, to serve Camberwell and other destinations in south-east London. In 1913, the [[Lord Mayor of London]] announced a proposal for the Bakerloo Tube to be extended to [[The Crystal Palace]] via [[Camberwell Green]], [[Dulwich]] and [[Sydenham Hill]], but nothing was done to implement the plan.<ref name="Crystal">[[#Reference-badsey|Badsey-Ellis 2005]], p. 268.</ref> In 1921, the LER costed an extension to Camberwell, Dulwich and Sydenham and, in 1922, plans for an extension to [[Orpington]] via [[Loughborough Junction railway station|Loughborough Junction]] and [[Catford]] were considered. In 1928, a route to [[Rushey Green]] via Dulwich was suggested. Again, no action was taken, although the [[London and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee]] approved an extension to Camberwell in 1926.<ref name="points se">[[#Reference-horne|Horne 2001]], pp. 40-41.</ref>

Elephant & Castle station was also to be reconstructed with a third platform, a new ticket hall and escalators. Financial constraints prevented any work from being started.<ref name="points se"/>

==Improvements, 1914&ndash;1928==
[[File:Compound of Piccadilly Circus Tube Station.jpg|thumb|Ticket hall at Piccadilly Circus station]]
Overcrowding was a major problem at many stations where interchanges were available with other Underground lines and efforts were made in a number of places to improve passenger movements. In 1914, work was carried out to provide larger ticket halls and install escalators at Oxford Circus, Embankment and Baker Street. In 1923, further work at Oxford Circus provided a combined Bakerloo and CLR ticket hall and added more escalators serving the CLR platforms. In 1926, Trafalgar Square and Waterloo received escalators, the latter in conjunction with expansion of the station as part of the CCE&HR's extension to [[Kennington tube station|Kennington]]. Between 1925 and 1928, Piccadilly Circus station saw the greatest reconstruction. A large circular ticket hall was excavated below the road junction with multiple subway connections from points around the Circus and two flights of escalators down to the Bakerloo and Piccadilly platforms were installed.<ref name="improvements">[[#Reference-horne|Horne 2001]], pp. 38-39.</ref>

==Move to public ownership, 1923&ndash;1933==
Despite closer co-operation and improvements made to the Bakerloo stations and to other parts of the network,<ref name="improvements elsewhere">The CLR extension to [[Ealing Broadway station|Ealing Broadway]] opened in 1920, the CCE&HR extension to [[Edgware tube station|Edgware]] opened in 1923/24 and the CS&LR extension to [[Morden tube station|Morden]] opened in 1926 &ndash; [[#Reference-rose|Rose 1999]].</ref> the Underground railways continued to struggle financially. The UERL's ownership of the highly profitable [[London General Omnibus Company]] (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group, through the pooling of revenues, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways.<ref name="LGOC">By having a virtual monopoly of bus services, the LGOC was able to make large profits and pay dividends far higher than the underground railways ever had. In 1911, the year before its take over by the UERL, the dividend had been 18&nbsp;per cent &ndash; [[#Reference-wolmar|Wolmar 2004]], p. 204.</ref> However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the profitability of the whole UERL group.<ref name="pirates">[[#Reference-wolmar|Wolmar 2004]], p. 259.</ref> 

In an effort to protect the UERL group's income, its chairman [[Albert Stanley, 1st Baron Ashfield|Lord Ashfield]] [[lobbying|lobbied]] the government for regulation of transport services in the London area. Starting in 1923, a series of legislative initiatives were made in this direction, with Ashfield and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[London County Council]]lor (later [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] and [[Secretary_of_State_for_Transport#Minister_of_Transport|Minister of Transport]]) [[Herbert Morrison]], at the forefront of debates as to the level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought. Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the UERL group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of the [[London County Council|LCC's]] tram system; Morrison preferred full public ownership.<ref name="SubRail_08">[[#Reference-wolmar|Wolmar 2004]], pp. 259<U+2013>262.</ref> After seven years of false starts, a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB), a public corporation that would take control of the UERL, the Metropolitan Railway and all bus and tram operators within an area designated as the [[London Passenger Transport Board#London Transport Passenger Area|London Transport Passenger Area]].<ref name="LPTA">

The plan for the extension to Camberwell was kept alive throughout the 1930s and, in 1940, the permission was used to construct sidings beyond Elephant & Castle. After the Second World War, the plans were revised again, with stations located under Walworth Road and Camberwell Green, and the extension appeared on tube maps in 1949.<ref name="1949map">{{cite web

As part of the LPTB's [[New Works Programme]] announced in 1935, new tube tunnels were constructed from Baker Street to the former MR station at [[Finchley Road tube station|Finchley Road]] and the Bakerloo line took over the stopping service to [[Wembley Park tube station|Wembley Park]] and the MR's [[Stanmore tube station|Stanmore branch]].<ref name="stanmore">[[#Reference-horne|Horne 2001]], pp. 46-48.</ref> The service opened in November 1939 and remained part of the Bakerloo line until 1979 when it transferred to the [[Jubilee line]].<ref name="Rose"/>

The Bakerloo line's Watford service frequency was gradually reduced and, from 1965 ran only during rush hours. In 1982, the service beyond Stonebridge Park was ended as part of the fall-out of the cancellation of the GLC's ''Fares Fair'' subsidies policy.<ref name="stonebridge">[[#Reference-horne|Horne 2001]], pp. 72-73.</ref> A peak hours service was restored to Harrow & Wealdstone in 1984 and a full service was restored in 1989.<ref name="h&w">[[#Reference-horne|Horne 2001]], p. 78.</ref>
