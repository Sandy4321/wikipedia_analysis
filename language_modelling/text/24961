'''''The Pit and the Pendulum''''' (released on DVD in the United States as '''''The Inquisitor''''') is a 1991 [[horror film|horror]] film directed by [[Stuart Gordon]] and based on [[The Pit and the Pendulum|the short story by Edgar Allan Poe]]. The film is an amalgamation of several of Poe's tales, including "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]" and "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]". The film also appropriates the anecdote of "The Sword of [[Damocles]]", re-assigning it to the character of Torquemada.

==Plot==
Set in Spain, 1492, Grand Inquisitor Torquemada leads a bloody reign of terror, torturing and killing in the name of religion. Upset with the way the Church is practicing torture, Maria speaks out during a public burning and whipping of a title-stripped family. Maria's own beauty leads Torquemada into temptation and brutal atonement. Confused over his desires, he accuses Maria of being a witch and to be tortured until confession. During Maria's interrogation, Torquemada cannot help but to stare at her naked body leading him to order her put in the prison. Imprisoned, Maria is befriended by Esmerelda, a confessed witch. Together they struggle to save themselves from the sinister Torquemada.

Outside the castle walls, Maria's husband Antonio breaks into the castle to rescue his innocent wife. After a failed escape, Antonio is imprisoned for his actions and Torquemada decides to test his new machine of pain on him; The Pit and the Pendulum.
