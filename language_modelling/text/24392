The '''buildings and architecture of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]''', a city in [[Somerset]] in the south west of England, reveal significant examples of the [[architecture of England]], from the [[Roman Baths (Bath)|Roman Baths]] (including their significant [[Celt]]ic presence), to the present day. The city became a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1987, largely because of its architectural history<ref name="appx3">{{cite web |url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/worldheritage/3Append.htm |title=City of Bath World Heritage Site Management Plan - Appendix 3 |accessdate=2007-11-01 |publisher=Bath and North East Somerset Council }}</ref> and the way in which the city landscape draws together public and private buildings and spaces.<ref name="unescowh"/> The many examples of [[Palladian architecture]] are purposefully integrated with the urban spaces to provide "picturesque aestheticism".<ref name="unescowh"/> It is the only entire city in Britain to achieve World Heritage status,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/gb|title=United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|work=World Heritage|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2009-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/8119528.stm|title=Bath keeps world heritage status|date=2009-06-25|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-09-21}}</ref> and is a popular tourist destination.

Important buildings include the Roman Baths; [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] architect [[Robert Adam]]'s [[Pulteney Bridge]], based on an unused design for the [[Rialto Bridge]] in [[Venice]];<ref name="pultney"/> and [[Bath Abbey]] in the city centre, founded in 1499<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bathabbey.org/ |title=Home Page |publisher=www.bathabbey.org |accessdate=2009-11-11 }}</ref> on the site of an 8<sup>th</sup> century church.<ref>John Britton, {{cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FRMNAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=bath+abbey&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=a%20new%20church%20dedicated%20to%20St%20Peter&f=false |title=The history and antiquities of Bath Abbey church, page 18 |publisher=Harvard University, 1825 |accessdate=2009-11-11 }}</ref> Of equal importance are the residential buildings designed and built into boulevards and crescents by the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] architects [[John Wood, the Elder]] and his son [[John Wood, the Younger]] - well-known examples being the [[Royal Crescent]], built around 1770, and [[The Circus (Bath)|The Circus]], built around 1760, where each of the three curved segments faces one of the entrances, ensuring that there is always a classical [[facade]] facing the entering visitor. 

Most of Bath's buildings are made from the local, golden-coloured, [[Bath Stone]]. The dominant architectural style is Georgian,<ref name="gadd"/> which evolved from the [[Palladian revival]] style that became popular in the early 18<sup>th</sup> century. The city became a fashionable and popular spa and social centre during the 18<sup>th</sup> century.  Based initially around its hot springs, this led to a demand for substantial homes and guest houses. The key architects, John Wood and his son, laid out many of the city's present-day squares and crescents within a green valley and the surrounding hills. According to [[UNESCO]] this provided... "an integration of architecture, urban design, and landscape setting, and the deliberate creation of a beautiful city".<ref name="unescowh">{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/428|title=City of Bath|work=World Heritage|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref> Development during modern eras, including the development of the transport infrastructure and rebuilding after bomb damage during [[World War II]], has mostly been in keeping with earlier styles to maintain the integrated cityscape.

Buildings from Bath's pre-Norman period either no longer exist, or their remains are below street level.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.romanbaths.co.uk/walkthrough.aspx |title=Walkthrough |publisher=www.romanbaths.co.uk |accessdate=2009-11-11 }}</ref> [[archeology|Archaeological]] sites in the central area of the city have supplied some details about how they may have looked, while the lower areas of the [[Roman Baths (Bath)|Roman Baths]] reveal significant remains from the Roman period. 

The Baths were built around [[UK Geothermal Springs|hot springs]], the only ones naturally occurring in the United Kingdom.<ref name="worldheritageplan">{{cite web |url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/worldheritage/2.3Des.htm |title=City of Bath World Heritage Site Management Plan |accessdate=2007-11-01|publisher=Bath and North East Somerset Council}}</ref> Archaeological evidence suggests that the main spring in its natural state was treated as a shrine by the [[Celts]]. During the early [[Roman Britain|Roman occupation of Britain]], in the 60s or 70s AD, engineers drove oak piles into the mud to provide a stable foundation and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with [[lead]]. These still survive. At this early stage the spring was an open pool in the corner of the temple precinct. It fed a bathing complex on its south side within a [[Barrel vault|barrel-vaulted]] building. The complex was gradually built up over the next 300&nbsp;years.<ref>Barry Cunliffe, ''City of Bath'' (1986), pp. 21<U+2013>24.</ref> All the [[stonework]] above the level of the baths is from more recent periods including the 12th century, when [[John of Tours]] built a curative bath over the King's Spring reservoir, and the 16th century, when the city corporation built a new bath (Queen's Bath) to the south of the spring.<ref name="appx3">{{cite web |url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/worldheritage/3Append.htm |title=City of Bath World Heritage Site Management Plan - Appendix 3 |accessdate=2007-11-01 |work=Bath and North East Somerset Council }}</ref> The spring is now housed in 18th-century buildings designed by architects [[John Wood, the Elder]] and [[John Wood, the Younger]];<ref name="baths">{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=442113|title=King's Bath|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=2009-01-10}}</ref><ref name="worldheritageplan"/> visitor access is via an 1897 concert hall by J M Brydon, which is an eastward continuation of the [[Grand Pump Room, Bath|Grand Pump Room]] with a glass-domed centre and single-storey radiused corner.<ref>{{cite web | title= Concert Hall | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=442115 | accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref>

Around 1770 the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] architect [[Robert Adam]] designed [[Pulteney Bridge]], a three-arched bridge spanning the Avon. He used as his prototype an original, but unused, design by [[Andrea Palladio]] for the [[Rialto Bridge]] in [[Venice]].<ref name="pultney">{{cite journal |last=Manco |first=Jean |year=1995 |title=Pulteney Bridge  |journal=[[Architectural History]]|volume=38 |pages=129<U+2013>145 |doi=10.2307/1568625 |url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0066-622X(1995)38%3C129%3APB%3E2.0.CO%3B2-M |accessdate= 2007-12-12 |quote= }}</ref> Thus, Pulteney Bridge became not just a means of crossing the river, but also a shopping arcade. Along with the Rialto Bridge, is one of the very few surviving bridges in Europe to serve this dual purpose.<ref name="pultney"/> It has been substantially altered since it was built. The bridge was named after Frances and [[Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet|William Pulteney]], the owners of the [[Bathwick]] estate for which the bridge provided a link to the rest of Bath.<ref name="pultney"/> The best known of Bath's terraces is the [[Royal Crescent]], built between 1767 and 1774 and designed by the younger [[John Wood, the Younger|John Wood]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Royal Crescent | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=447275 | accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> But all is not what it seems; while Wood designed the great curved fa<U+00E7>ade of what appears to be about 30 houses with Ionic [[column]]s on a rusticated ground floor, that was the extent of his input. Each purchaser bought a certain length of the fa<U+00E7>ade, and then employed their own architect to build a house to their own specifications behind it; hence what appears to be two houses is sometimes one. This system of town planning is betrayed at the rear of the crescent: while the front is completely uniform and symmetrical, the rear is a mixture of differing roof heights, juxtapositions and fenestration. This "''Queen Anne fronts and Mary-Anne backs''" architecture occurs repeatedly in Bath.<ref>{{cite book |title=Subjects and Citizens: Nation, Race, and Gender from Oroonoko to Anita Hill |last=Moon |first=Michael |coauthors=Cathy N.

In the early 19th century the romantic [[medieval]] [[Gothic revival|gothic]] style appeared as a backlash to the [[symmetry]] of Palladianism. By the middle of the 19th century, as a result of new [[technology]], construction was able to develop incorporating [[steel]] as a building component.

In 1810 the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] opened linking the River Avon at Bath to [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]].

The opening of the [[Great Western Railway]] in 1841 removed much of the canal's traffic, and in 1852 the railway company took over its running. [[Bath Spa railway station]] is the principal [[railway station]] in Bath. It was built in 1840 by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Bath Spa Station  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=443080 | accessdate=2006-12-15}}</ref>. It is in an asymmetrical [[Tudor style]] with curving gables, and lies on the north bank of the [[River Avon, Bristol|Avon]], with the line swerving elegantly across from the southern bank to the station and then back again. [[Bath Green Park railway station|Green Park railway station]] opened in 1870 as the terminus of [[Midland Railway|Midland Railway's]] [[Mangotsfield and Bath Branch Line]]. For some of its life, it was known as Bath Queen Square. It includes a vaulted glass roof in a single-span wrought iron arch structure. Parts of the distinctive glass roof were damaged during bombing raids in April 1942, and the glazing was not re-instated during railway usage after the war. Following the [[Beeching Axe|Beeching Report]], passenger trains ceased from 1966 and the last goods train ran in 1971. In the 1980s the rail approaches to the station were redeveloped as a major supermarket opened in December 1982, and the station itself is used as a pedestrian passageway to and from the city; there are a number of small shop units in the former station buildings. The [[Victoria Art Gallery]], a free public [[art museum]] and library was built between the Guildhall and Pulteney Bridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=442375|title= Victoria Art Gallery and Library|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=2009-09-24}}</ref> It was designed by [[John McKean Brydon]]. The exterior of the building includes a statue of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], by  [[A. C. Lucchesi]], and friezes of classical figures by [[G. A. Lawson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/speel/place/bath.htm |title=The Victoria Art Gallery, Bath |accessdate=2007-10-28 |format= |work=The website of Bob Speel }}</ref>

In the 1920s and 1930s Bath's architectural traditions combined with an [[art deco]] style in buildings such as [[The Forum, Bath|The Forum]] which opened as a 2,000-seat [[Movie theater|cinema]] in 1934, and has since been converted into a church and concert venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=448551|title=The Forum|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=2009-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bathforum.co.uk/1/history.html|title=History|publisher=The Forum|accessdate=2009-09-19}}</ref> The [[Royal United Hospital]] opened in the [[Weston, Bath|Weston]] suburb, about {{convert|1.5|mi|km|1}} from the city centre in 1932.

Over 400&nbsp;people were killed, and more than 19,000&nbsp;buildings were damaged or destroyed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcrescentbath.com/HistoryBathatWar.htm |title=History - Bath at War |accessdate=2007-12-09 |work=Royal Crescent Society, Bath }}</ref> Houses in the [[Royal Crescent]], [[The Circus (Bath)|Circus]] and [[The Paragon, Bath|Paragon]] were burnt out along with the Assembly Rooms, while part of the south side of [[Queen Square (Bath)|Queen Square]] was destroyed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcrescentbath.com/HistoryRoyalCrescent%202.htm |title=Royal Crescent History: The Day Bombs fell on Bath  |accessdate=2007-12-09 |work=Royal Crescent Society, Bath }}</ref> A postwar review of inadequate housing led to the clearance and redevelopment of large areas of the city in a postwar style, often at variance with the Georgian style of the city. In the 1950s the nearby villages of [[Combe Down]], [[Twerton]] and [[Weston, Bath|Weston]] were incorporated into Bath to enable the development of further housing, much of it [[council housing]] such as the [[Whiteway, Bath|Whiteway]] estate. In the 1970s and 1980s it was recognised that conservation of historic buildings was inadequate, leading to more care and reuse of buildings and open spaces. In 1987 the city was selected as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], recognising its international cultural significance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/environmentandplanning/worldheritagesite/|title=Bath - World Heritage Site|publisher=Bath and North East Somerset Council|accessdate=2009-10-22}}</ref>

In the 1960s and early 1970s the way in which some parts of Bath were redeveloped, resulting in the loss of some 18th- and 19th-century buildings, led to a popular campaign to change the way the city was developing, which drew strength from the publication of Adam Fergusson's ''The Sack of Bath''.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Image of Georgian Bath, 1700-2000: Towns, Heritage, and History |last=Borsay |first=Peter |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0198202652 }}</ref> Since 2000, developments have included the [[Thermae Bath Spa|Bath Spa]], [[SouthGate, Bath|SouthGate]], and the Bath Western Riverside project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southgatebath.com |title=South Gate Bath |accessdate=2007-12-08 |work=Morley }}</ref>
