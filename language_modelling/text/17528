'''Moeen Munir Ali''' (born 18 June 1987) is an English cricketer of Pakistani extraction. He is a left-handed batsman and off-spin bowler who played [[county cricket]] for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] before moving to [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] after the 2006 season. As of 2014, Ali is a regular on [[England cricket team|England's]] [[Twenty20 International]] and Test sides. He won Warwickshire's [[NBC Denis Compton Award]] in both 2004 and 2005. His off-spin is marked by a strongly spun off-break and a well-concealed arm ball.

==Career==

===Warwickshire===
Ali signed for Warwickshire aged just 15, hitting a half-century for the county's Second XI a few days before his 16th birthday.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/77/77111.html | title=Warwickshire Second XI v Nottinghamshire Second XI | accessdate=2006-12-16 | publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}</ref> After more games at this level in 2004, and a first outing for [[England Under-19 cricket team|England Under-19s]] against their [[Bangladesh Under-19 cricket team|Bangladeshi counterparts]] he spent the succeeding winter playing for the Under-19s on their tour of India.

2005 saw Ali make his [[first-class cricket|first-class]] debut, against [[Cambridge University Centre of Cricketing Excellence|Cambridge University]] in May. He impressed with the bat, making 57 [[not out]] in his only innings, and sent down two overs for 15 runs. Playing that summer against [[Sri Lanka Under-19 cricket team|Sri Lankan Under-19s]], he starred in the final "Test" by making 52 not out and 100 not out (the latter innings from 56 balls) and claiming seven wickets. He was then selected for the [[2006 Under-19 Cricket World Cup]], which was held in [[Sri Lanka]], and was immediately promoted to captain by coach [[Andy Pick]]. He made three half-centuries in the tournament, and took seven wickets.

Ali received additional opportunities for his county in 2006, playing his first [[List A cricket|List A]] games. The first of these came against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]], where he dismissed [[Steffan Jones]] to claim his maiden first-team wicket. He also took his first wickets in first-class cricket, and his first three victims were all [[Test cricket|Test]] players: [[Stuart Law]], [[Dominic Cork]] and [[Dave Mohammed]]. With the bat he scored 68 on his [[County Championship]] debut against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]], then equalled that score against [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]].

Ali's opportunities were somewhat limited, however, and [[Alex Loudon]] took his place in the side. In July 2006, with the expiry of his Warwickshire contract only months away, Ali brushed off rumours of a move to Worcestershire, saying "I don't know anything about it",<ref>{{cite web | url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/254319.html | title=Moeen Ali dismisses Worcestershire rumours | last=Thompson | first=Jenny | date=24 July 2006 | accessdate=2006-12-16 | publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> but in September it was announced that Ali would indeed be leaving to join that county. The player himself said that he had been impressed by Worcestershire and felt it gave him the best prospects of furthering his career.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/259860.html | title=Moeen Ali joins Worcestershire | date=18 September 2006 | accessdate=2006-12-16 | publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref>

===Worcestershire===
He made his debut for Worcestershire in their ten-wicket win over [[Loughborough UCCE]] on 25 April 2007, but had a rather poor game, returning 0<U+2013>92 off 16 overs and being dismissed for 12 in his only innings.

Ali's highest first-class score of 250, scored against Glamorgan at New Road, featured a partnership of 219 with Matt Pardoe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/593568.html |title=Worcestershire v Glamorgan at Worcester, Jun 20-23, 2013 {{!}} Cricket Scorecard {{!}} ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |date=23 June 2013 |accessdate=2014-06-24}}</ref>

At the end of the 2010 season Worcestershire secured promotion to the first division of the County Championship.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/counties/9006380.stm |title=Worcestershire win promotion with victory over Sussex |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 September 2010 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref> After he was overlooked by the England Lions and England Performance Programme at the end of the 2010 English season, Moeen opted to play club cricket in [[Bangladesh]] at the suggestion of Bangladesh all-rounder [[Shakib Al Hasan]]. Shakib played for Worcestershire as their overseas player in 2010 and the link with the club led to Moeen representing Mohammedan Sporting Club in the Ispahani Premier Division.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.thecricketer.com/?p=12423 |title=Moeen strengthens Worcs ties with Bangladesh |publisher=The Cricketer |first=Paul |last=Bolton |date=22 December 2010 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref>

====2011 Season====
During the 2011 season Moeen spent three weeks as Worcestershire's acting captain while the usual club captain, [[Daryl Mitchell (cricketer)|Daryl Mitchell]], was injured. Though he had captained England Under-19s, it was the first time he filled the role for his county. As he was inexperienced, Moeen approached senior players [[Vikram Solanki]] and [[Ben Scott]] for advice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.thecricketer.com/?p=25164 |title=Moeen's captaincy stint whets appetite for more |first=Paul |last=Bolton |publisher=The Cricketer |date=6 June 2011 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref>

Pakistan off-spinner [[Saeed Ajmal]] was Worcestershire's overseas player for a short time in 2011 and while at the club he encouraged Moeen to try bowling the [[doosra]].<ref name=doosra>{{cite web |url=http://blog.thecricketer.com/?p=36928 |title=Saeed Ajmal helps Moeen to perfect his doosra |first=Paul |last=Bolton |publisher=The Cricketer |date=28 February 2012 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref> Moeen had to wait until July before registering his first century of the season, and his first since September the previous year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2011/content/story/524864.html |title=Moeen hundred sets up Worcestershire |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref> His innings of 158 runs from 244 balls against [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] was in vain as Worcestershire succumbed to an innings defeat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/316/316311.html |title=f53297 Worcestershire v Somerset: LV County Championship 2011 (Division 1) |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref> The following month Moeen twice scored a century in the [[2011 Clydesdale Bank 40|Clydesdale Bank 40]] only for Worcestershire to lose, against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] and the [[Netherlands cricket team|Netherlands]].<ref name=Sussex158>{{cite web |url=http://cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/316/316356.html |title=a21460 Sussex v Worcestershire: Clydesdale Bank 40 2011 (Group A) |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2011/content/story/528924.html |title=Barresi heroics overturn Moeen ton |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |date=21 August 2011 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref> In the first match against Sussex he passed his previous best score of 136 in List A cricket, scoring 158 runs from 92 balls.<ref name=Sussex158/> In Worcestershire's first season back in the first division, Moeen scored 930 runs in the County Championship, making him the club's second-highest run scorer in the competition behind Solanki.

====2012 Season====
In February 2012, before the start of the English season, Worcestershire's director of cricket [[Steve Rhodes]] commented that Ali's doosra was "not too difficult to pick at the moment but he's learning a few tricks and he's got other things up his sleeve. It's a work in progress".<ref name=doosra/>

====2013 Season====
After the departure of former England international Vikram Solanki at the end of the 2012 season Ali was handed a new 5 year contract.<ref name="bbc">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/22407591|title=BBC Sport - Worcestershire: Moeen Ali and Gareth Andrew extend contracts|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2014-08-07}}</ref> After performing well, including five consecutive 50s, Ali was called up to the England Lions where he scored 61 runs against Australia<ref name="espncricinfo">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/8917.html|title=Moeen Ali &#124; England Cricket &#124; Cricket Players and Officials &#124; ESPN Cricinfo|publisher=espncricinfo.com|accessdate=2014-08-07}}</ref> with many calling for him to be selected for the full side.

Moeen averaged 62 in Division 2, totalling 1375 runs altogether - the highest of any batsmen in first class cricket and finished with 4 centuries and 8 fiftys as well as 28 wickets. He was awarded county cricket's MVP award<ref name="worcesternews">{{cite web|url=http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/sport/10719183.Moeen_targets_England_role_after_MVP_success/|title=Moeen targets England role after MVP success (From Worcester News)|publisher=worcesternews.co.uk|accessdate=2014-08-07}}</ref> beating Samit Patel on the final day of the season and was also named PCA player of the year.<ref name="bbc2">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/24388586|title=BBC Sport - Moeen Ali wins PCA Player of the Year award|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2014-08-07}}</ref> Ali was also called up to the England development squad ahead of their Australian Ashes tour.

==International career==

===Tour of West Indies===
Moeen was included in the English Squad for the [[2014 ICC World Twenty20]] in [[Bangladesh]]. Before the tournament, the squad played the West Indies in a limited overs series. Making his [[one day international|ODI]] debut against the [[English cricket team in West Indies in 2013<U+2013>14|West Indies]] on 28 February 2014, he scored 44 runs before being dismissed and took his maiden ODI wicket. In the second match he made ten runs and took figures of 1-11. Moeen was again impressive in the third match, making his first half century in a score of 55. He ended up scoring 109 runs and picking up 3 wickets in the three match series. He made his T20 debut in the second match of the T20 series, although he scored just 3 runs and did not bowl. In the final match of the series he batted at 7 but was ran out for 3 runs.

===2014 World T20===
Moeen was a part of England's world T20 squad. He managed 49 runs in 4 matches and ending up wicketless.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/26392337 |title=West Indies v England: Michael Lumb's ton fails to prevent loss |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 February 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-01 }}</ref> His tournament got off to a good start with him hitting 36 against New Zealand, and bowling 1 over for 7 runs. In the second game against Sri Lanka, he was dismissed for a first ball duck, although only four runs came of his over. Against South Africa he managed 10 runs and bowled two overs for 17 runs. He had a poor final match against the Netherlands, bowling 1 over 13 runs and being dismissed for just 3.

===Test selection===
Moeen was named in the England Test squad for their series [[Sri Lankan cricket team in England in 2014#Test series|against Sri Lanka]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Chris Jordan, Sam Robson & Moeen Ali in England Test squad |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/27694656 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 June 2014 |accessdate=2014-06-05 }}</ref> before making his debut in the first Test.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sri Lanka tour of England and Ireland, 1st Test: England v Sri Lanka at Lord's, Jun 12-16, 2014 |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england-v-sri-lanka-2014/engine/match/667899.html?version=iframe |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |date=12 June 2014 |accessdate=2014-06-12 }}</ref> Ali made a score of 48 in the initial innings but only made 4 in the second. However, in the second Test of the series he made his maiden century in the second innings having started the final day with England on 57 for 5. England were denied a draw when [[James Anderson (cricketer)|Jimmy Anderson]] was caught off the penultimate ball of the match having survived 55 balls.

In the third test against India at the Aegeas Bowl, he took his first 5 wicket haul in test cricket, finishing with 6-67.

==Controversy==
Moeen generated controversy when he wore "Save Gaza" and "Free Palestine" wristbands in connection with the [[2014 Israel<U+2013>Gaza conflict|Gaza conflict]] during day 2 of the [[Indian cricket team in England in 2014#3rd Test|third Test]] match of the Investec Series. The ICC code bars players from "conveying messages which relate to political, religious or racial activities or causes". According to the [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]], Moeen's stance was "humanitarian, not political" and a spokesman stated that "the ECB do not believe he has committed any offence." Later in the match the England team wore shirts sporting the [[Help for Heroes]] logo, and a minute's silence was observed by both teams to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the [[First World War]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dobell|first1=George|title=ECB defends Moeen's 'Save Gaza' wristband|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/765187.html|accessdate=2014-07-29|work=Cricinfo|date=July 28, 2014}}</ref>

Although Moeen had been cleared by the ECB to wear the bands, the decision was overruled by the match referee, [[David Boon]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Andy|title=Moeen Ali banned from wearing 'Save Gaza' wristbands while playing for England|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/29/moeen-ali-wristbands-england-india-icc|accessdate=2014-07-29|work=The Guardian|date=29 July 2014}}</ref>
