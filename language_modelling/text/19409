The church of '''Gran Madre di Dio''' is a [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassic]]-style church located in front of Piazza Vittorio Veneto, at the western side of the bridge Vittorio Emanuele I, in Turin, Italy.<ref name="BorghiArrigoni1999">{{cite book | author1=Marcella Borghi | author2=Viviana Arrigoni | author3=Guglielmo Martinello | coauthors=Touring Club of Italy, Antony Shugaar | title=Italy: A Complete Guide to 1,000 Towns and Cities and Their Landmarks, with 80 Regional Tours | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6Gny1hm3wZoC&pg=PA374 | accessdate=13 December 2012 | date=January 1999 | publisher=Touring Editore | isbn=978-88-365-1522-6 | page=374 }}</ref>

The church was proposed in 1814 to celebrate the return of the King [[Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia]] to the crown after the defeat of [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]. The architect was [[Ferdinando Bonsignore]],  whose project was chosen after a competition. Construction began in 1818, only to pause for nearly a decade, and restart in 1827, under the rule of [[Charles Felix of Sardinia]]. The church was inaugurated in 1831 under [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]].<ref name="Hitchcock1977">{{cite book | author=Henry Russell Hitchcock | title=Architecture: 19th and 20th Centuries | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fyUBgspcsgAC&pg=PA92 | accessdate=13 December 2012 | year=1977 | publisher=Yale University Press | isbn=978-0-300-05320-3 | page=92 }}</ref>

Others who contributed to the construction were [[Giuseppe Formento]] and the engineer [[Virginio Bordino]].  The latter helped raise the columns on the fa<U+00E7>ade. The architect [[Luigi Canina]] was consulted during construction. Flanking the entrance staircase are two statues representing Faith (with calyx) and Religion by [[Carlo Chelli]]. The tympanum of the church states: ''ORDO POPVLVSQVE TAVRINVS OB ADVENTVM REGIS'', which can be translated as: ''(By the) Public Orders (dedicated) for the Return of the King''. The church architecture recalls the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome.

The steps of the Gran Madre appear twice in the 1969 film ''[[The Italian Job]]''.
