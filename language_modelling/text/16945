The '''''South Carolina''-class battleships''', also known as the '''''Michigan'' class''', were built during the first decade of the twentieth century for the [[United States Navy]]. Named {{USS|South Carolina|BB-26|2}} and {{USS|Michigan|BB-27|2}}, they were the first American [[dreadnought]]s<U+2014>powerful warships whose capabilities far outstripped those of the world's [[Pre-dreadnought battleship|older battleship]]s.

In the opening years of the twentieth century, the prevailing theory of naval combat was that battles would continue to be fought at relatively close range using many small, fast-firing guns. Each of the ships in the previous battleship class (the {{sclass|Connecticut|battleship|4}}) had many medium-sized weapons along with four large guns. This soon changed as American naval theorists proposed that a ship mounting a homogeneous battery of large guns would be more effective in battle.

As this idea began to enjoy wider acceptance, the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] authorized the country's navy to construct two small {{convert|16000|LT|t|adj=on|sigfig=4}} battleships<U+2014>roughly the same size as the ''Connecticut'' class<U+2014>which was at least {{convert|2000|LT|t|sigfig=3}} smaller than the current foreign standard. The solution to this was found in an ambitious design drawn up by Rear Admiral [[Washington L. Capps]], the chief of the navy's [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]], which featured heavy armament and relatively thick armor, both favored by naval theorists. However, it was in balancing congressionally mandated limits to displacement and the inherent design trade-offs between main armament, armor, and speed that only mediocre speed was achieved<U+2014>an ultimately fatal disadvantage that severely limited their utility in a conflict.

With their [[superfire|superfiring]] main armament, press accounts billed ''South Carolina'' and ''Michigan'' as heralding a new epoch in warship design, alongside the British {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, but both were soon surpassed by ever-larger and stronger vessels like [[super-dreadnought]]s. The class's low top speed of {{convert|18.5|kn|mph km/h}}, as compared to the {{convert|21|kn|mph km/h|adj=on}} [[Standard-type battleship|standard]] of later American dreadnoughts, relegated them to serving with older, obsolete battleships during the First World War. Thereafter, both ''South Carolina''s were scrapped with the signing of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]].

== Background ==
{{main|Dreadnought}}
In 1901, the US Navy's [[pre-dreadnought battleship|battleship designs]] reflected the prevailing theory of naval combat<U+2014>that battles would initially be fought at some distance, but the ships would then approach to close range for the final blows, when shorter-range, faster-firing guns would prove most useful. The premier battleship class then under construction carried four large {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on|0}}, eight {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on|0}}, and twelve {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns, a striking power slightly heavier than typical foreign battleships of the time.<ref>Campbell, "United States of America: 'The New Navy', 1883<U+2013>1905," 137<U+2013>38, 143; Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 52.</ref>

[[File:USS New Hampshire c1910 LOC ggbain 04455.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The ''South Carolina'' design began in the United States' previous [[pre-dreadnought battleship|pre-dreadnought]] battleships, such as the preceding [[Connecticut-class battleship|''Connecticut'' class]] ({{USS|New Hampshire|BB-25|2}} pictured). Photograph <span class="plainlinks">[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/ggbain.04455 courtesy]</span> of the [[Library of Congress]].]]
The [[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute]]'s ''[[Proceedings (magazine)|Proceedings]]'' magazine devoted space in two of its 1902 issues to possible improvements in battleship design. The first article was authored by Lieutenant Matt H. Signor, who argued for a ship with 13- (330&nbsp;mm) and 10-inch (254&nbsp;mm) 40-caliber guns in four triple turrets. The secondary battery would be composed of 5-inch (127&nbsp;mm)/60 guns. While this paper alone did not sway the Navy's designers, it provoked enough thought that ''Proceedings'' published comments on the story from Captain [[William M. Folger]], Professor P.R. Alger and naval constructor [[David W. Taylor]]<U+2014>an up-and-coming officer and future head of the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]] (C&R). These comments expressed doubt that the proposed vessel could be modified into a feasible design, but they praised his thoughts as a step in the right direction. Alger believed that Signor was on the right track in suggesting larger armament, though he thought that triple turrets would be unworkable and eight 12-inch guns in four twin turrets would be a much more realistic arrangement. Naval historian [[Norman Friedman]] believes that this was one of the "earliest serious proposals for a homogeneous big-gun battery."<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 51; Signor, "A New Type of Battleship"; Folger, Alger, Taylor, "Discussion".</ref>

The suggestion leading directly to the ''South Carolina'' class came from [[Homer Poundstone]], a [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] in the Navy, who became the principal proponent of an American all-big-gun design. In a December 1902 paper written for President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], he argued for greatly increasing the size of current battleships, although he also supported retaining mixed main batteries.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 52.</ref>{{efn-ua|Roosevelt thought that the letter was "excellent", though he was not sure that he could get Congress to adopt a similar view.<ref>[http://www.theodorerooseveltcenter.org/Research/Digital-Library/Record/ImageViewer.aspx?libID=o183827 Theodore Roosevelt to Homer C. Poundstone], 27 December 1902, Theodore Roosevelt Papers, Manuscripts division, The Library of Congress.</ref>}}  However, by the March and June 1903 editions of ''Proceedings'', Poundstone began advocating for an all-big-gun arrangement, featuring twelve {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on|spell=in|sp=us}} guns mounted on a {{convert|19330|LT|t|adj=on}} ship. In October of the same year, the Italian naval architect [[Vittorio Cuniberti]] presented a similar idea in an article for ''[[Jane's Fighting Ships]]'' entitled "An Ideal Battleship for the British Navy". He argued in favor of a ship with twelve 12-inch guns on a slightly larger displacement than the battleships in service at the time, {{convert|17000|LT|t}}. He believed that the higher weight would allow 12 inches of armor and machinery capable of propelling the ship at {{convert|24|kn|lk=in}}. Poundstone used what he believed to be the great popularity for this idea among Europeans to justify the all-big-gun design.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 52; Cuniberti, "An Ideal Battleship"; Friedman, "South Carolina Sisters," Poundstone, "Size of Battleships for U.S. Navy," 161<U+2013>174; Poundstone, "Proposed Armament," 377<U+2013>411.</ref>

In 1903, Poundstone's designs began receiving attention from American naval authorities. After being refined by [[Washington Irving Chambers]], Poundstone's work was brought to the [[Naval War College]], where it was tested in [[war game]]s during the 1903 [[Newport Conference]]. The results indicated that a theoretical battleship that dispensed with the intermediate 8- and 7-inch armament and was armed with only twelve 11- or 12-inch guns, all able to fire on a single [[broadside]], was worth ''three'' of the battleships then in service. According to the men who conducted the tests, the main reasoning for the finding was that the measure of effective gun ranges was directly related to the maximum length of an enemy's torpedo range. At this time, the latter was roughly {{convert|3000|yd|m}}; at that distance, the 7- and 8-inch guns common to American intermediate batteries would not be able to penetrate the armor of enemy battleships. Worse still, it was certain that<U+2014>as the United States was developing a {{convert|4000|yd|adj=on}} torpedo<U+2014>gun range would have to rise in the near future, making the intermediate guns even less useful. However, a homogeneous main battery of 11- or 12-inch guns would be able to penetrate the armor and have sufficient explosive power to disable an enemy capital ship, and adding as many {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on|spell=in}} guns as possible would provide a strong defense against torpedo-carrying but unarmored [[destroyer]]s.<ref name="Friedman 53">Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 53; Friedman, "South Carolina Sisters".</ref>

Faced with this evidence, the [[General Board of the United States Navy|General Board]] sent a formal request in October 1903 to C&R, asking it to draw up plans for a battleship including these characteristics. No progress had been made by 26 January 1904, when the General Board asked C&R for a design including four 12-inch guns, eight 10-inch or larger guns, and no intermediate armament beyond 3-inch anti-destroyer guns. The move to only 10-inch weaponry was the result of doubt among naval authorities that heavier guns could physically be mounted on a ship's broadside. No action was taken on this request until September, when C&R began planning a ship with four 12-inch guns in dual turrets along with eight dual 10-inch or four single 12-inch guns.<ref name="Friedman 53"/>

Meanwhile, the Naval War College played three battleship designs against each other at its 1904 Newport Conference: the ships that were built following the 1903 conference; the new C&R design from September; and the latest battleships under construction, the ''Connecticut'' class. The 7- and 8-inch guns, and even the 10-inch guns, were demonstrated again to be unsatisfactory; even when hitting a battleship at the ideal angle of {{degree|90}} to its [[belt armor|belt]], they failed to pierce beyond 12&nbsp;inches of [[Krupp armor]]<U+2014>not enough to counter enemy capital ships. Speed calculations were also performed which demonstrated that even a {{convert|3|kn|adj=on}} advantage over an enemy fleet would be inconsequential in the final outcome of almost all naval battles because the slower ships could stay within range by turning on a tighter radius.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 53<U+2013>54.</ref>

Within the naval bureaus, however, there was still much resistance. In mid-to-late 1904, Poundstone continued to lobby the General Board while C&R protested that the final determinant in a naval battle would be the light guns<U+2014>and in any case such a large uniform battery was not feasible. Poundstone replied with a design of his own creation, which he called USS ''Possible'' and fit twelve 11-inch guns on a ship that displaced {{convert|19330|LT|t|sp=us}}.{{efn-ua|Full specifications for ''Possible'' included:<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 52.</ref>

On 3 March 1905, [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] passed a bill that authorized the Navy to construct two new battleships to be named after the [[U.S. state|states]] of [[South Carolina]] and [[Michigan]]. The maximum tonnage limit was set at {{convert|16000|LT|t|0|abbr=off|sp=us}}, the same weight as the mixed-battery ''Connecticut'' class of two years prior, in an attempt to stem the rising displacement<U+2014>and accompanying costs<U+2014>of the Navy's new capital ships.<ref name="Friedman 55">Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 55; Friedman, "South Carolina Sisters".</ref> The provision was met with a mixed reception from naval designers. Some, including retired [[Admiral of the Navy (United States)|Admiral of the Navy]] [[George Dewey]], thought the limit should have been set at the minimum standard of foreign battleships, or around {{convert|18000|LT|t|0|abbr=off}}. Others believed adding a significant amount of speed or firepower<U+2014>something one would expect with an increase in tonnage<U+2014>would require many more than 18,000&nbsp;tons, and argued that the increase in size would buy nothing more than an increased target profile.<ref>"[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D1EFD345913738DDDAF0994D8415B858CF1D3 Dispute over Battleships]," ''New York Times'', 16 October 1905.</ref>

The Constructor of the Navy, Rear Admiral [[Washington L. Capps]], devised an ambitious design that packed powerful armament and thick armor onto the small hull. He believed that future naval battles would involve fleets rather than single-ship actions, and so while the [[wing turret]]s so common in European designs were useful in the latter role for putting a maximum amount of firepower in any given direction, they were less so when operating as part of a [[line of battle]].  From this, Capps theorized that the principal concern of battleships was how much shell weight they could fire per broadside. The arrangement of [[superfire|superfiring]] turrets placed on the centerline would allow the hull to be as short as possible while still having the most powerful broadside possible.<ref name="Friedman 55"/> A ship with its main battery placed along the center of the ship can focus the same amount of fire to port or starboard during a broadside. This is juxtaposed against [[wing turrets]], which had significant shortcomings: their location on the left or right of a ship's superstructure led to smaller possible broadsides, and the extreme weight placed on the sides of the ships led to torsional stress and rolling inertia.<ref>Friedman, ''Battleship Design'', 134.</ref>{{efn-ua|It is hard to pinpoint an exact date as to when the superfiring idea was adopted. There were many all-big-gun plans, but only an index of them survives. Friedman speculates that the superfiring arrangement may have been accepted by the various bureaus by April 1905, giving as evidence a memo from Capps to the [[Bureau of Engineering]] asking for smaller engineering spaces in order "to increase the main battery." The design as a whole was finalized on 26 June 1905, though it took until mid-1906 to mail it to shipyards to begin the [[bidding]] process.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 58, "[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B12F93E5512738DDDAF0A94DB405B868CF1D3 Our New Battleships to Rival Dreadnought]," ''New York Times'', 26 March 1906.</ref>}}

{{quotebox|align=left|width=40%|quoted=1|quote=Early in [the twentieth century], several navies simultaneously decided to shift to a [[main battery]] composed entirely of the heaviest guns. The first and most famous product of this innovation was {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, which gave her name to a generation of [[dreadnought|all-big-gun ships]]. Parallel to but independent of her conception was the American ''South Carolina'', in many ways equally revolutionary. She introduced a superfiring main battery, a design economy which gave her a better-protected broadside equal to that of her British contemporary on about 3,000&nbsp;[long]&nbsp;tons less displacement. ([[Norman Friedman]], ''U.S. Battleships: An Illustrated Design History'' [Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1985], 51)}}
As the additional main battery turrets with their associated magazines used a great amount of space within each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways to stay within the tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: there was no room for engines that could provide the same amount of power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at this point that he considered turbine propulsion, for which he would have needed extra room. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.<ref>Breyer, ''Battleships'', 196; Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 57.</ref> The designers were running into the problem that naval historian Norman Friedman calls the "squeeze": the essential elements of a battleship (armament, propulsion machinery, and armor) typically added up to about sixty&nbsp;percent of their design displacement; favoring one of these factors, the "three primary military qualities", would mean accepting compromises in one or both of the others.<ref>Friedman, ''Battleship Design'', 22.</ref>

In the end, the choice of armament and armor meant that the ''South Carolina''{{'}}s top speed was lower than HMS ''Dreadnought'', the namesake British ship built shortly before the ''South Carolina''s, and all future US battleships.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 57.</ref>

At a design displacement of {{convert|16000|LT|t|0}}, the ''South Carolina'' class dreadnoughts were the same size as their {{sclass-|Connecticut|battleship|4}} pre-dreadnought predecessors. In service, they could actually be lighter: {{USS|Louisiana|BB-19|2}} had a [[standard displacement]] of {{convert|15272|LT|t|0}}, while ''Michigan'' was only {{convert|14891|LT|t|0}} by the same measurement. The ship's hull size was also comparable to the ''Connecticut''s, with a length of {{convert|452|ft|9|in|0}} [[length overall|overall]], {{convert|450|ft|m|0}} [[length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]], and the same at the [[waterline length|waterline]]. The class' [[beam (ship)|beam]] was {{convert|80|ft|2.5|in|m|0}}, [[draft (ship)|draft]] was {{convert|24|ft|6|in|m|0}}, and [[metacentric height]] was {{convert|6.9|ft|m|0}} [[normal displacement|normally]], coming in slightly lower at {{convert|6.3|ft|m|0}} when at [[full-load displacement|full load]].<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 430<U+2013>32; "South Carolina" and "Michigan," ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships''.</ref> They were designed to carry about 869 men.<ref>Campbell, "United States of America: 'The New Navy', 1883<U+2013>1905," 112.</ref>

The ''South Carolina''s had a propulsion system consisting of two [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]] driving two 3-bladed propellers. These were in turn powered by twelve coal-fired [[superheater|superheating]] [[Babcock & Wilcox]] [[water-tube boiler]]s located in three [[ship floodability|watertight compartments]]. Together, they weighed {{convert|1555|LT|t|0}}, which was just over the specified contract limit. Traditional triple-expansion engines were installed rather than the [[steam turbine]]s used in the British ''Dreadnought''. The actual coal capacity of the ships was {{convert|2374|LT|t|0}} at full load, slightly more than the designed maximum of {{convert|2200|LT|t|0}}, allowing for an endurance of {{convert|6950|nmi|0}} at {{convert|10|kn|0}}. While both ships surpassed {{convert|20|kn|0}} in idealized trial conditions, the navy expected that the normal top speed would be around {{convert|18.5|kn|0}}.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 431<U+2013>32; Breyer, ''Battleships'', 196; Leavitt, "U.S.S. ''Michigan''," 941<U+2013>43.</ref>

The class' [[main battery]] consisted of eight [[12"/45 caliber Mark 5 gun|{{convert|12|in|mm|0|adj=on}}/45]] [[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] Mark 5 guns in four [[gun turret|turrets]], one pair fore and one aft, with 100 rounds for each gun. The guns were placed in an innovative superfiring arrangement, where one turret was mounted slightly behind and above the other. The anti-[[torpedo-boat]] secondary armament of twenty-two {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns was mounted in [[casemate]]s, and the two {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s were placed beneath the waterline, one on each side of the ship.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 431, Friedman, ''Battleship Design'', 133<U+2013>34.</ref>

Armor on the ''South Carolina'' class was described by naval author Siegfried Breyer as "remarkably progressive", despite deficiencies in horizontal and underwater protection. The [[belt armor|belt]] was thicker over the magazines, {{convert|12|to|10|in|mm|0}}, than over the propulsion, {{convert|11|to|9|in|mm|0}}, and in front of the forward magazines, {{convert|10|to|8|in|mm|0}}. The casemates were also protected with 10&nbsp;to&nbsp;8&nbsp;inches of armor, while the [[deck (ship)|deck armor]] varied from {{convert|2.5|to|1|in|mm|0}}. The turrets and conning tower had the heaviest armor, with 12<U+2013>8<U+2013>2.5&nbsp;inches (face/side/roof; 305<U+2013>203<U+2013>63.5&nbsp;mm) and {{convert|12|to|2|in|mm|0}}, respectively. The barbettes were protected with 10&nbsp;to&nbsp;8&nbsp;inches of armor. The total weight of the armor amounted to 31.4% of the design displacement, slightly more than the next three battleship classes.<ref>Friedman, ''U.S. Battleships'', 431; Friedman, ''Battleship Design'', 166<U+2013>67.</ref>

The warship was billed as epoch-making, and the spectacle drew many prominent individuals, including the governor and lieutenant-governor of Michigan, the governor of New Jersey, the mayor of [[Detroit]], and the secretary of the Interior Department, along with many naval admirals and constructors.<ref>"The ''Michigan''," ''Navy'', 26; "Launching the Navy's 'All-Big-Gun' Battleship," ''Harper's Weekly'', 30.</ref> Like its sister ship, ''South Carolina'' was just over halfway completed when it was launched.

After their [[fitting-out]] stage, the two ships were put through [[sea trial]]s to ensure they met their contracted specifications.<ref>Leavitt, "U.S.S. ''Michigan''," 915; Dinger, "U.S.S. ''South Carolina''," 200, 228.</ref> The first attempt at putting ''Michigan'' through a trial was conducted at the navy's traditional testing grounds off [[Rockland, Maine]] beginning on 9 June 1909. Although the ship completed its standardization run, other tests were disrupted when it ran aground on a [[sand bar]]. Although ''Michigan'' was pulled off without incident, the navy soon discovered that both propellers required repair, delaying the completion of the trials until 20<U+2013>24 June.<ref>Leavitt, "U.S.S. ''Michigan''," 915<U+2013>17.</ref> The battleship was commissioned several months later on 4 January 1910<U+2014>making the United States the third country to have a dreadnought in commission, behind the United Kingdom and Germany, but just ahead of Brazil's {{sclass-|Minas Geraes|battleship|4}}<U+2014>and its [[shakedown cruise]] lasted until 7 June.<ref>"''Michigan''," ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships''.</ref>

''South Carolina''{{'}}s trials were conducted off the Delaware Capes beginning on 24 August 1909, and its standardization runs were slightly faster than ''Michigan''{{'}}s.

After being commissioned, both ships were assigned to the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|US Atlantic Fleet]]. The two operated up and down the American [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] from July until November. On 2 November, as part of the Second Battleship Division, the ships left the [[Boston Navy Yard]] for a training voyage to Europe, where they visited the [[Isle of Portland]] in the United Kingdom and [[Cherbourg]] in France. In January 1911, they returned to the US naval base in [[Guantanamo Bay]], Cuba before continuing to another base in [[Norfolk, England|Norfolk]]. After further maneuvers, the two ships split up; ''Michigan'' remained on the east coast, while ''South Carolina'' embarked on another trip to Europe. The ship visited [[Copenhagen]] (Denmark), [[Stockholm]] (Sweden), [[Kronstadt]] (Russia), and [[Kiel]] (Germany)<U+2014>the last during [[Kiel Week|''Kieler Woche'']], a large [[regatta|sailing event]]<U+2014>before returning in July 1911.<ref name="BothDANFS">"''South Carolina''" and "''Michigan''," ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships''.</ref>

''South Carolina'' next took part in the 1911 [[naval review]] in New York, before several months of traveling to ports on the east coast and welcoming a visiting German naval squadron including the battlecruiser {{SMS|Moltke}} and two [[light cruisers]]. After a three-month overhaul in Norfolk, ''South Carolina'' joined ''Michigan'' on a cruise to  [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[New Orleans]], [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], and [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] in Mexico, as part of the [[Special Service Squadron]]. ''South Carolina'' later visited [[Colon, Panama|Colon]], [[Panama]] in January 1913. Both ships continued their previous service of visiting east coast ports before unrest in Mexico and the Caribbean caused the American government to order them away. ''South Carolina'' landed marines on Haiti on 28 January to protect the American delegation there. They returned to the ship when [[Oreste Zamor]] took power, but continued disorder later led the United States to [[United States occupation of Haiti|occupy Haiti]]. ''South Carolina'' then joined ''Michigan'' at Vera Cruz while the United States [[United States occupation of Veracruz|occupied that city]].<ref name="BothDANFS"/>

At the beginning of the First World War, both of the ''South Carolina''-class battleships were grouped with two older pre-dreadnoughts ({{USS|Vermont|BB-20|2}} and {{USS|Connecticut|BB-18|2}}) due to their top speeds, which were lower than all subsequent US battleships. ''South Carolina'' was [[refit]]ted in Philadelphia between 14 October and 20 February 1915, and both ships were kept on neutrality patrols on the American side of the Atlantic, even after the US [[American entry into World War I|entered the war]] on 6 April 1917. In January 1918, ''Michigan'' was training with the main fleet when they traveled through a strong storm. The high winds and waves caused its forward [[Lattice mast|cage mast]] to collapse, killing six and injuring thirteen.<ref>Jones, ''U.S. Battleship Operations'', 110; "''South Carolina''" and "''Michigan''," ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships''.</ref>

On 6 September 1918, ''South Carolina'' escorted a fast convoy partway across the Atlantic, becoming one of the first American battleships (alongside {{USS|New Hampshire|BB-25|2}} and {{USS|Kansas|BB-21|2}}) to do so. When returning to the United States, ''South Carolina'' lost its starboard propeller. When continuing with the port propeller, a valve in its engine malfunctioned; continuing with an auxiliary valve caused a large amount of vibration, so the ship was stopped just hours later for temporary repairs on the main valve before continuing to the Philadelphia Naval Yard for repairs. ''Michigan'' had the same problem when escorting a convoy in the next month; the ship lost its port propeller on 8 October, but managed to return home on 11 October without further incident. After the war's end on 11 November 1918, both ''South Carolina''-class battleships were used to repatriate American soldiers that had been fighting in the war.<ref>Jones, ''U.S. Battleship Operations'', 118<U+2013>20.</ref><!--

The idea for using battleships in a similar role<U+2014>that of transporting troops to the war zone<U+2014>was actually proposed by ''South Carolina''{{'}}s executive officer in early 1918, but was not taken up:

{{bq|style=font-size:90%|text=Nearly half a million tons of shipping, built for a military purpose, aging rapidly in a military sense and doomed to early obsolescence, is occupying a passive role in the greatest war in history. I submit simply that this tonnage should be put to a military use&nbsp;... If our battleships cannot actively engage the enemy and are not needed to contain the enemy, it is essential, in order that their role may be an active one, that they bring pressure to bear upon the enemy by projecting man power within striking distance of the battle front. (C.S. Freemen to Daniels, "War Use for Battleships," memorandum, 28 January 1918, OB File, RG 45, in Jerry W. Jones, ''U.S. Battleship Operations in World War I'' [Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1998], 120)}}-->

In the years after the war, the two battleships were used for training cruises. The terms of the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]], which limited naval construction to avert a vastly expensive naval [[arms race]], also called for disposing of dozens of older battleships in the signatories' navies. ''South Carolina'' was decommissioned on 15 December 1921, shortly before the end of the conference, and its sister followed on 11 February 1921, days after the treaty was signed. Both were [[wikt:stricken|stricken]] from the navy listing on 10 November 1923 and [[ship breaking|scrapped]] during 1924 in the [[Philadelphia Naval Yard]].<ref name="BothDANFS"/>
