===Extreme Championship Wrestling===
In the spring of 1999, she was approached by [[Paul Heyman]], the owner and [[List of professional wrestling slang#B|booker]] of [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW).<ref name=slambio/><ref name=popularity/> Dumas debuted in ECW as Miss Congeniality,<ref name=hchistory>{{cite book|title=Hardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of ECW|author=Scott E.

Dumas was introduced to veteran wrestler [[Dory Funk, Jr.]] by ECW wrestler [[Rob Van Dam]], and Funk invited her to attend his wrestling school, The Funkin' Conservatory.<ref name=slambio/><ref name=popularity/><ref name=digest>{{cite web|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_6_2/ai_71403977|title=Lita's More Than Lovely|author=Thomas Chamberlin| publisher=Wrestling Digest|accessdate=2007-06-06|date=April 2001}}</ref> Dumas attended Funk's school alongside 23 men,<ref name=slambio/><ref name=stomp/> graduated from the school in August 1999, and returned to ECW.<ref name=slambio/><ref name=digest/> Meanwhile, Funk and his wife compiled video footage of Dumas and sent it to the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]].<ref name=slambio/><ref name=popularity/><ref name=stomp/> The Federation was sufficiently impressed, and on [[November 1]] [[1999]], Dumas was signed to a WWF developmental deal.

===World Wrestling Federation===
====1999<U+2013>2000====
After honing her skills at the [[Memphis Championship Wrestling]] developmental territory, Dumas was given the ring name Lita and paired with [[lucha libre|luchador]] [[Mr. <U+00C1>guila|Essa Rios]].<ref name=digest/><ref name=hchistory/> Lita and Rios made their WWF debut on the [[February 13]] [[2000]] episode of ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night HEAT]]'', where Rios was [[List of professional wrestling slang#B|booked]] to win the [[WWF Light Heavyweight Championship]] from [[Duane Gill|Gillberg]].<ref name=slambio/> Lita mimicked his moves, notably the [[Moonsault]] and [[Professional wrestling throws#Hurricanrana|Hurricanrana]], immediately after he had performed them on an opponent.<ref name=slambio/> In May 2000, an [[List of professional wrestling slang#A|angle]] was developed in which Lita found Rios cavorting with [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|The Godfather]] and his [[Prostitution|hoes]], causing tension between them.<ref name=slambio/> Rios eventually [[List of professional wrestling slang#T|turned]] on Lita by [[powerbomb]]ing her after she inadvertently cost him a match. As part of the storyline, Lita was saved from a beating at the hands of Rios by the [[Hardy Boyz]] ([[Matt Hardy|Matt]] and [[Jeff Hardy|Jeff]]),<ref name=slambio/> and the trio formed a [[List of professional wrestling slang#S|stable]] known as [[Hardy Boyz#Team Xtreme|Team Xtreme]].<ref name=hchistory/> As a member of Team Xtreme, Lita developed a more "alternative" image, wearing baggy pants with a tight [[G-string|thong]] which was hiked up high above her pants, clearly exposed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Adam Copeland|title=Adam Copeland On Edge|pages=225|publisher=Simon and Schuster|date=2004|isbn=1416505237}}</ref> During her time with Team Xtreme, Lita became the only female to ever be physically involved in a [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match]] in WWE.<ref>Amy Dumas. ''Lita: A Less Traveled R.O.A.D - The Reality of Amy Dumas'' (p.202)</ref>

In June 2000, Team Xtreme began an angle with [[T & A (professional wrestling)|T & A]] (Test & Albert), with Lita engaging in a rivalry with their manager, [[Trish Stratus]].<ref name=wwebio/><ref name=slambio/><ref name=digest/> The rivalry developed into an off and on long term [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] between the two women that lasted until Stratus retired in 2006. The feud ended shortly after [[WWF Fully Loaded#2000|Fully Loaded 2000]], where Lita [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinned]] Stratus in a six person intergender tag team match.<ref name=digest/> Immediately following her feud with Stratus, Lita began feuding with [[WWE Women's Championship|WWF Women's Champion]] [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley]].<ref name=popularity/> In the main event of the [[August 21]] [[2000]] episode of [[WWE Raw|''RAW is WAR'']], Lita, as part of a [[List of professional wrestling slang#P|push]], defeated Stephanie with a [[moonsault]] to win the Women's Championship for the first time.<ref name=slambio/><ref name=popularity/><ref name=digest/><ref name=reign1>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/women/30445413212111234|title=Lita's First Reign|publisher=WWE.com|accessdate=2007-04-05}}</ref> The match also featured [[The Rock (entertainer)|The Rock]] as the [[List of professional wrestling match types#Special referee|Special Guest Referee]] and constant interference from [[Triple H]] and [[Kurt Angle]].<ref name=reign1/>

Lita held the Women's Championship for 73 days,<ref name=reign1/> which included retaining her title in a [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore match]] against [[Jacqueline Moore|Jacqueline]] on [[October 9]].<ref>Pat McNeill. ''The Tables All Were Broken'' (p.36)</ref> In the course of her reign, Lita became embroiled in the storyline feud between the Hardy Boyz and [[Edge and Christian]]. In retaliation for her frequent interference in their matches, Edge and Christian cost Lita the Women's Championship, helping [[Lisa Moretti|Ivory]] defeat her in a four way match on the [[November 2]] episode of [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|''SmackDown!'']].<ref name=popularity/><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/women/3044541321211125|title=Ivory's Third Reign|publisher=WWE.com|accessdate=2007-04-05}}</ref> Ivory was in a conservative-based stable named [[Right to Censor]] at that time, which targeted Lita for her attire and moves. Lita attempted to regain the title on several occasions, wrestling Ivory at [[Survivor Series (2000)|Survivor Series]] and [[WWE Rebellion#2000|Rebellion]], but she was thwarted on each occasion by [[Stevie Richards|Steven Richards]], Ivory's mentor. She spent the remainder of the year in an angle with would-be suitor [[Dean Malenko]],<ref name=slambio/><ref name=popularity/> on one occasion unsuccessfully challenging him for the [[WWF Light Heavyweight Championship]].

====2001<U+2013>2002====
Lita continued to feud with Dean Malenko in early 2001, and she defeated him in a singles bout on the [[February 19]] episode of ''RAW is WAR'' with the assistance of [[Matt Hardy]]. Following the match, Hardy kissed Lita, beginning their on-screen relationship and turning their real-life romance into an [[List of professional wrestling slang#A|angle]].<ref name=slambio/><ref name=romance>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_4_3/ai_80302527/pg_2|title=Broken hearts and broken limbs|author=Steve Anderson|publisher=Wrestling Digest|accessdate=2007-10-23|date=December 2001}}</ref> The couple wrestled in several intergender tag team matches throughout the early part of the year. 

Following a brief feud between Team Xtreme and [[The Two-Man Power Trip]] ([[Triple H]] & [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]]) in April 2001, Lita began pursuing the WWF Women's Championship once again. She challenged Women's Champion [[Joanie Laurer|Chyna]] at [[WWE Judgment Day#2001|Judgment Day]] on [[May 20]] but was defeated in what was Chyna's last WWF match. In the same month, [[Eddie Guerrero]] began teaming with the Hardy Boyz. An angle involving Guerrero and Lita began to develop,<ref name=romance/> but it was cut short in June 2001 when Guerrero was sent to [[drug rehabilitation]], and Chyna, who was also supposed to be involved in the storyline, was also released from the WWF.

In July 2001, Lita and Trish Stratus joined forces to combat [[Stacy Keibler]] and [[Torrie Wilson]], members of [[The Alliance]]: [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] and [[World Championship Wrestling]] wrestlers who were invading the WWF as part of [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] angle.<ref name=wwebio/> At the [[WWF Invasion|Invasion]] pay-per-view on [[July 22]], Lita and Stratus defeated Keibler and Wilson in the first ever tag team [[List of professional wrestling match types#Bra and Panties match|bra and panties]] match.<ref name=wwebio/> Throughout The Invasion, Lita, Stratus, and Jacqueline feuded with Alliance members Keibler, Wilson, [[Lisa Moretti|Ivory]], and [[Nora Greenwald|Mighty Molly]]. The Invasion storyline ended on [[November 18]] at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series 2001]], where Lita took part in a [[List of professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|six pack challenge]] for the WWF Women's Championship, which had been vacated by Chyna earlier that year, but Stratus won the match and the title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/2001/results/|title=Survivor Series 2001: Results|publisher=WWE.com|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref>

In late 2001, the Hardy Boyz began an angle in which they were feuding with one another.<ref name=romance/><ref name=pat339>Pat McNeill. ''The Tables All Were Broken'' (p.339)</ref> Lita refereed a match between them at [[WWE Vengeance#2001|Vengeance]] on [[December 9]].<ref name=slambio/><ref name=pat339/> Jeff won the match with a [[List of professional wrestling slang#W|worked]] finish that had Lita failing to notice that Matt had placed his leg on the rope during Jeff's successful pin attempt. Continuing the angle on the following episode of ''RAW'', Matt defeated Lita and Jeff in a [[List of professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap match]], shortly after informing Lita that both their relationship and the Hardy Boyz were finished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/011210.html|title=RAW: December 10, 2001 Results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-11-04}}</ref> Lita began accompanying Jeff Hardy to the ring for his matches, with the two implicitly involved in a deeper friendship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/011213.html|title=SmackDown!: December 13, 2001|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/011217.html|title=RAW: December 17, 2001 Results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-11-04}}</ref> On the [[December 17]] episode of ''RAW'', both Jeff and Lita were sidelined with [[kayfabe]] injuries following a title match between Jeff and [[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Champion]] [[The Undertaker]].<ref name=wwebio/> The injuring of both his brother and ex-girlfriend led to a reconciliation between the members of Team Xtreme, and on the [[December 20]] episode of ''SmackDown!'', Matt Hardy faced The Undertaker but was also injured. All three members of Team Xtreme were removed from WWF television for several weeks, with journalist [[Dave Meltzer]] attributing the removal to a lack of storylines for the trio.
