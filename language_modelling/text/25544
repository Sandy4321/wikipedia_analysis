The '''Church Midwing JC-1''',  a.k.a. '''Church Mid-Wing Sport''',<ref name = "aerofiles ca">
{{cite web |url=http://aerofiles.com/_ca.html |title=American airplanes: Ca - Ci |publisher=Aerofiles.com |date=2008-08-15 |accessdate=2011-01-28}}</ref> is a [[wing configuration#Number and position of main-planes|midwing]] [[Air racing|racing aircraft]] designed by James Church using the fuselage of a Heath aircraft.

==Design and development==
The Church Midwing was designed to be an affordable homebuilt aircraft. Church marketed kits for $190.

The open cockpit midwing aircraft featured windows in the wings for visibility downward.<ref>{{cite book|title=Aeronca C-2: the story of the flying bathtub|author=Jay P. Spenser, National Air and Space Museum}}</ref>

==Operational history==
Built to be a pylon racer, a Church Midwing placed third in the 1930 National Air Races. The Church used many parts from the [[Heath Parasol]] design. A 1931 advertisement placed by Heath in Popular Mechanics extolled the virtues of its first place finish with its [[wing configuration#Number and position of main-planes|parasol]] configuration, compared to the Church's midwing planform.<ref>{{cite journal|magazine=Popular Mechanics|date=January 1931}}</ref>
