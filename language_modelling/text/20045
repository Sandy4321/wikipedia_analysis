'''''Pandorum''''' is a 2009 German-British [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[thriller film]] written by Travis Milloy, directed by [[Christian Alvart]] and produced by [[Paul W.S. Anderson]]. The film stars [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]]. Filming began in [[Berlin]] in August 2008. ''Pandorum'' was released on September 25, 2009 in the United States,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=41441 |title=Pandorum |work=ComingSoon.net |publisher=Coming Soon Media, L.P |accessdate=2009-06-25}}</ref> and on October 2, 2009 in the UK. The film's title refers to the fictional psychological condition of the astronauts in [[outer space]].

==Plot==
Corporal Bower ([[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]]) wakes up from [[hypersleep]] by a power surge to find himself alone, [[Retrograde amnesia|with no memory of who he is or what happened]] to the crew of the 60,000-passenger [[sleeper ship]] ''[[Elysium]]''. Another power surge manages to awake Lieutenant Payton ([[Dennis Quaid]]) who is also suffering from amnesia. They are unable either to access the ship's bridge or to communicate with anyone else, including the three-man flight crew team they are supposed to relieve. With the ship wrecked by power surges from a failing reactor, Bower assumes he must be a technician automatically awakened by the principal on-board computer in order to effect repairs. 

Bower begins exploring the spacecraft under Payton's radio guidance. Noticing odd physical symptoms, Bower talks with Payton about Pandorum, a psychological condition brought on by extended periods of deep-space travel and hypersleep. Its symptoms and effects include severe paranoia, vivid hallucinations, and [[epistaxis]]. Payton recounts the story of another ship called the ''[[Eden]]'', whose Captain went insane and became convinced that the ship was cursed, so he jettisoned 5000 hibernating passengers casting them out into space to their death. 

As Bower continues searching the ship - partially in hopes of finding answers, and partially to find his wife - he encounters dead bodies, fast-moving humanoid tribal creatures (dubbed Hunters), and non-lethal (but deadly up close according to Payton) energy projectile weapon which he uses. Escaping from one of the creatures, he encounters other amnesia suffering survivors: Manh ([[Cung Le]]), a Vietnamese man working in Agriculture, and Nadia ([[Antje Traue]]), a partly barefooted genetic engineer safeguarding millions of samples of plant and animal life from Earth who attempted to rob Bower of his supplies and shoes for her own survival. In a fight with each other, Bower convinces them to assist him.

On the flight deck, Payton discovers another crew member, Corporal Gallo ([[Cam Gigandet]]), who reveals that he was part of the flight crew that received the final message from Earth. He claims that his other two crew mates suffered from an onset of Pandorum, and that he had to kill them in self-defense. Payton is wary of Gallo, noting his strange behavior.

While crossing the main hunting ground of the creatures the trio find themselves in a fight with one of the Hunters. After slaying it, they then realize that other Hunters were watching the entire fight and give the trio a chance to run. As they flee, the Hunters feed on the corpse of their own and another passenger woken up by a power surge.

Bower, Manh, and Nadia run into the lair of Leland (Eddie Rouse) who has been awake for years. There Nadia gives her theory of what the creatures might be, which she assumes are the passengers who have mutated due to an enzyme that was given to them in their feeding tubes that was intended to accelerate evolution so that their bodies may adapt to living conditions on Tanis, but instead have [[Adaption|adapted]] to the ship. This causes Bower to question why they are not affected by the enzyme which she replies by saying that passengers could have been out longer than even Leland. After hearing this, Leland corrects her by telling them a story that he heard from others about how the Hunters truly came to be in a mythological matter and shows depictions of the events through carvings on the walls in his lair. At the same time Gallo tells Payton about what happened to his team. Earth, suffering from massive [[overpopulation]], launched the ''Elysium'' on a 123-year voyage to an [[terrestrial planet|Earth-like planet]] called Tanis to create a [[space colonization|settlement]], with its passengers being seen as "[[Hero]]es". When the ship received a message of Earth's destruction (either through war or natural disaster), conflict had happened between the crew leaving only one alive (Gallo) whom Leland describes as both God and The Devil. He would deem himself as a king and became home to his "''[[sin]]''" which is depicted in the form of lightning bolts appearing around his head while having epistaxis (referencing Pandorum). He had then awakened some of the passengers to play devious games with them by sending out those who had obeyed his will into the hold of the ship to fight each other and feed on the corpse of the fallen, much like what the trio had witnessed at the main hunting ground. The passengers who had taken part in these acts were also depicted as having Pandorum. When he grew tired of this, he went back into suspended animation, and left the rest of the passengers awake. While he slept the passengers had, over time, adapted to their animalistic living conditions by becoming the primitive creatures that now roam the ship, which Leland describes as " a whole new world of ''evil''". 

Listening to this story, the survivors lose consciousness, having been gassed by their host. While at the same time Payton starts to show symptoms of Pandorum after hearing what had happened to Earth. Upon awakening, they find themselves in shackles, with Leland preparing to kill them for food. Nadia then berates Leland, to which he responds by stabbing her. He prepares to kill her first but is convinced by Bower to allow them to restart the ship's nuclear reactor, which is about to shut down. En route, they pass through the passenger hypersleep chamber, which prompts Bower to recall the truth - his wife left him before he left Earth, and was left behind as the planet died. At the same time, he realizes that something is amiss about Payton. 

The group fights their way down to the reactor, where the mutants have taken refuge. While Manh lures some of the cannibals away, Bower activates the reactor, averting disaster. After a climactic battle, Manh defeats the Hunter leader, only to be killed by a seemingly harmless Hunter child. Leland, Bower and Nadia make a break for the bridge. 

Payton also regains his memories and realizes that Gallo is a hallucination. In truth ''he'' is Corporal Gallo and lost all knowledge of his crimes and real identity during hypersleep. Soon afterwards he dispatches the newly-arrived Leland with a lethal stab from a sedative gun and retreats to the bridge. It is there where Bower and Nadia confront him and "Payton" concedes his true identity. Gallo then retracts an inner bulkhead, apparently showing a view of space, though it is ominously void of any stars.   

Noticing that Bower is suffering from Pandorum, Gallo tells him that he should embrace it due to the fact that humanity had ruined the Earth and defines the condition as a form of "enlightenment" that will free him of human qualities such as morality. Bower then starts to hallucinate and imagines the aforementioned "sin" appear around Gallo as he tries to convince him to perform the same acts as the passengers that he had driven mad. Stating that his motivation was to create a natural state where life devours life, so that overpopulation would be prevented.

At this time, they see fluorescent sea creatures outside, revealing that the view outside is of a deep-sea environment.  The ship is already on Tanis, having crash-landed and sunk to the bottom of an ocean.  The ship's log finishes compiling the total running time of the trip and the 123-year mission is shown to have been going on for 923 years, revealing that the Hunters are ''not'' mutated passengers as they thought, but [[Devolution (biology)|devolved]] descendants of them.

Bower responds by attacking Gallo who manages to overpower him as he becomes overwhelmed by the symptoms of Pandorum. This causes Nadia to step in and confront Gallo, but due to her injury that she received earlier he manages to defeat her. When Gallo prepares to kill Nadia with her own knife Bower starts to hallucinate again. Imagining one of the creatures in front of him he fires at it with his weapon which accidentally causes a hull breach by cracking one of the windows. The water pressure breaks the screen and floods the ship, presumably drowning Gallo and any surviving creatures. Bower snaps back to sanity and escapes with Nadia to the ocean's surface in his own hypersleep pod. The damage to the ship triggers an emergency evacuation, ejecting 1211 other hibernating, healthy colonists onto the surface of a beautiful, sunlit alien world.

== Production ==
Travis Milloy wrote a preliminary script which was set on a prison ship. The characters played by [[Antje Traue]] and [[Cung Le]] were inmates. [[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]]'s character was a non-prisoner who did not trust anyone. The producers gave the script to director Christian Alvart who was thunderstruck by the similarities to his own screenplay titled ''No Where''. His dramatic story was about four astronauts aboard a settlers' ship who suffer from amnesia. Alvart decided that they should weld the two screenplays together, and the producers and Milloy agreed.

''Pandorum'' was announced in May 2008 with Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster in lead roles. Christian Alvart was attached to direct the film, based on a script by Travis Milloy. The movie was financed by [[Constantin Film]] through a joint venture deal with subsidiary Impact Pictures.<ref name="quaid">{{cite journal | first=Dave | last=McNary | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117985339.html?categoryid=1238&cs=1 | title=Quaid, Foster set for 'Pandorum' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] | publisher= | date=May&nbsp;8, 2008 | accessdate=August&nbsp;8, 2008 }}</ref>  The partnership helped fund the $40 million production. Constantin drew subsidies from Germany's Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg (MBB) regional film fund, the German Federal Film Board (FFA) and the German Federal Film Fund (DFFF). The German Federal Film Fund provided $6 million to the production, the fund's second-largest 2008 payout after $7.5 million for ''[[Ninja Assassin]]''.<ref name="impact">{{cite journal | last=Roxborough | first=Scott | title=Impact finds $40 mil to make 'Pandorum' | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i431ca797a370fbb2a3ea2b9931986666 | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=November&nbsp;7, 2008 | accessdate=December&nbsp;1, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | first=Christian | last=Koehl | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117990076.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title='Pandorum' secures German funds | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher= | date=August&nbsp;5, 2008 | accessdate=August&nbsp;8, 2008 }}</ref>  Filming took place at [[Babelsberg Studios]] in [[Potsdam]] in August 2008.<ref name="quaid" /><ref name="impact" />

===Allegory===
According to the bonus content on the DVD Christian Alvart had claim he approached the film as an allegory for human [[life on Earth]]. The ship is addressed to as its own [[world]] twice in the film, especially in its [[backstory]] told by Eddie Rouse's character which spoken in a strong [[Mythology|mythological]] tone that involved the presence of a god/devil-like figure responsible for the "evils" in that world and the degradation of the human condition, somewhat similar to the stories in the poems [[Works and Days]] and [[Paradise Lost]]. The film's title also appears to be derived from two names that are present in the poems, [[Pandora]] and [[Pand<U+00E6>monium (Paradise Lost)|Pand<U+00E6>monium]]. 

Another mythological reference is the name of the ship, Elysium, which was the resting place for heroes in classical mythology that bordered the [[River Lethe]], the part of the underworld where the memories of "earthly lives" were erased so that souls could be [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]]--similar to how the characters onboard the Elysium mostly have no memory of their lives on Earth and are even referred to as "heroes".
