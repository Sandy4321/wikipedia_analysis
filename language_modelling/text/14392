'''Vin<U+010D>a-Belo Brdo''' ({{lang-sr|<U+0412><U+0438><U+043D><U+0447><U+0430>-<U+0411><U+0435><U+043B><U+043E> <U+0431><U+0440><U+0434><U+043E>}}) is an [[archaeological site]] in the village of [[Vin<U+010D>a]], near [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]. The [[tell]] of Belo Brdo ('White Hill') is almost entirely made up of the remains of human settlement, and was occupied several times from the Early [[Neolithic]] (c. 5700 [[BCE]]) through to the [[Medieval]] period. The most substantial archaeological deposits are from the Neolithic-[[Eneolithic]] [[Vin<U+010D>a culture]], of which Vin<U+010D>a-Belo Brdo is the [[type site]].

==Geography==
Vin<U+010D>a is situated on the right bank of the [[Danube]], 14&nbsp;km downstream from [[Belgrade]], on a high [[loess]] terrace. This location was attractive to its Neolithic settlers: the Danube on one side provided water and fishing while on the other the valley of the river [[Bolecica]] connected it to a hinterland rich in minerals, ores, hunting grounds and fertile agricultural soils. Belo Brdo is one of the largest tell sites in the Balkans, covering 10 [[hectares]] of land with 9 metres of cultural deposits and a total height of 10.5 metres.<ref name="Tasic 1990">{{Harvnb|Tasic|Srejovic|Stojanovic|1990}}.</ref><ref name="Chapman 1981, p. 6">{{Harvnb|Chapman|1981|p=6}}.</ref>

==Excavations==
The first [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavations]] at Vin<U+010D>a were carried out by prominent Serbian archaeologist [[Miloje Vasi<U+0107>]] starting in 1908. These were interrupted by the outbreak of [[World War I]] and, apart from a brief season in 1924, Vasi<U+0107> was unable to obtain the necessary funding to continue working on the site from the impoverished postwar [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] government. However, with the financial backing of British businessman and archaeologist Sir [[Charles Hyde]], Vasi<U+0107> was able to resume excavations, on a much larger scale, between 1929 and 1931. These piqued the interest of the British press and the site was subsequently visited by several prominent intellectuals of the time, including Hyde, [[John Myres]], [[Veselin <U+010C>ajkanovi<U+0107>]], W. A. Hurtley and Bogdan Popovi<U+0107>.<ref name="Tasic 1990"/>

New excavations were begun in 1978 under the auspices of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]. From 1978 to 1982 the project focused on the Bronze Age and later layers, under the direction of Nikola Tasic and Gordana Vujovic. In 1982 excavations began on the more prominent Neolithic occupation, investigation of which continues to the present, led by Milutin Garasanin and Dragoslav Srejovic. Unfortunately in the 47 years between Vasi<U+0107>'s and the present research the site suffered considerable damage from unauthorized excavations and looting.<ref name="Tasic 1990"/>

==Occupation==
===Star<U+010D>evo period, c. 5700<U+2013>5300 BCE===
The earliest deposits at Belo Brdo date to around 5700 BCE<ref name="Chapman 2000, p. 206">{{Harvnb|Chapman|2000|p=206}}.</ref> and belong to the Early Neolithic [[Star<U+010D>evo culture]]. Evidence for this phase of occupation is scant owing to the disruption of the later Vin<U+010D>a settlement, and consists mainly of one large grave containing the remains of eleven males. This collective burial is unusual for Star<U+010D>evo sites, where individual inhumations are the norm. Otherwise the Star<U+010D>evo finds at Belo Brdo are unremarkable, and it is only one of several contemporary Star<U+010D>evo settlements in the vicinity of modern Belgrade.<ref name="Chapman 2000, pp. 205-207">{{Harvnb|Chapman|2000|pp=205-207}}.</ref>

===Vin<U+010D>a period, c. 5200<U+2013>4900 BCE===
[[Image:Vinca_clay_figure_02.jpg|thumb|A clay figurine from Vin<U+010D>a-Belo Brdo on display at the [[British Museum]].]]
A century after the abandonment<ref name="Chapman 2000, p. 239">{{Harvnb|Chapman|2000|p=239}}.</ref> of the Star<U+010D>evo settlement Belo Brdo was occupied by people of the [[Vin<U+010D>a culture]]. A total of thirteen building horizons from this period make up the majority of the tell's [[stratigraphy]], as new buildings were constructed on the debris left by periodic fires.<ref name="Chapman, pp. 205-206">{{Harvnb|Chapman|2000|pp=205-206}}.</ref> Belo Brdo was a major Vin<U+010D>a centre and, at its peak, one of the largest settlements in Neolithic Europe.<ref name="Tasic 1990"/> However, it was abandoned by 4900 BCE, some five centuries before the wider collapse of the Vin<U+010D>a culture.<ref name="Chapman 2000, p. 205">{{Harvnb|Chapman|2000|p=205}}.</ref><ref name="Chapman 2000, p. 217">{{Harvnb|Chapman|2000|p=217}}.</ref>

As in the earlier Star<U+010D>evo occupation, the Vin<U+010D>a houses at Belo Brdo were constructed primarily from wood and clay, but they also made use of levelled foundations, insulation and decoration with paint and wall coverings. In later phases large (40 x 60 m<sup>2</sup>) rectangular buildings with internal divisions and fixed furniture (benches, braziers, waterwheels, tables, etc.) appeared alongside the predominant one-roomed dwellings. The Vin<U+010D>a settlement was arranged on straight streets, fenced and considerably larger than that of the Star<U+010D>evo period.<ref name="Tasic 1990"/> The inhabitants' subsisted based both on the cultivation of grains ([[einkorn]], [[emmer]] and [[barley]]) and husbandry of domesticated animals (primarily [[cattle]], but also [[goats]], [[sheep]] and [[pigs]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} These [[agriculture|agricultural]] practices probably continued to be supplemented by hunting and fishing in the surrounding environs.

In the Early Vin<U+010D>a phase Belo Brdo seems to have developed into a ritual centre for the entire region. The manufacture of various types of cult objects, including 'mushroom amulet' and 'animal head' jewellery made from semi-precious stones, first appeared there and then spread to other Vin<U+010D>a sites. The raw material for these objects often had to be imported from considerable distance, indicating also that from its earliest phase the site was part of large-scale exchange networks.<ref name="Chapman 2000, pp. 208-212">{{Harvnb|Chapman|2000|pp=208-212}}.</ref> It is therefore thought that Belo Brdo was a key place in a wider Vin<U+010D>a [[prestige economy]], and an abundance of ritual paraphernalia, especially anthropomorphic figurines, is characteristic of the site. Another ritual innovation of Early Vin<U+010D>a phase Belo Brdo was the ''[[bucranium]]'' cult, where the painted skulls of cattle were fixed to the interior of houses. It is speculated that this practice may be linked to the wealth of individual households as measured in cattle.<ref name="Chapman 2000, p. 217"/> Later, however, Belo Brdo was to some degree eclipsed by the nearby site of [[Vr<U+0161>ac]], which became the centre of the much more widespread exchange of ornaments made from ''[[Spondylus]]'' shells.<ref name="Chapman 2000, p. 215.">{{Harvnb|Chapman|2000|p=215}}.</ref> Subsequently in the Late Vin<U+010D>a phase figurines became less widely circulated, and at the same time more standardised in form (in contrast to the many idiosyncratic styles of the Early Vin<U+010D>a phase). They also began to be inscribed with [[Vin<U+010D>a symbols]], which perhaps indicates that competition and conflict was arising between different groups within Belo Brdo trying to assert control over the flow of ritual goods.<ref name="Chapman 2000, p. 217"/>

===Post-Vin<U+010D>a occupations===
Belo Brdo has been occupied several times since the abandonment of the Vin<U+010D>a settlement, but not on the same scale. From the [[Copper Age]] there are four graves belonging to the [[Bodrogkereszt<U+00FA>r culture]], a very small [[Baden culture]] settlement and some evidence of visits by people of the [[Kostolac culture]]. There was a large but short-lived [[Bronze Age]] settlement belonging to the [[Vatin culture]]. In the [[Iron Age]] the size of the tell made it an attractive location for a significant [[Celts|Celtic]] [[hill fort]] complete with defensive earthworks.<ref name="Chapman 2000, p. 206"/><ref name="Chapman 2000, p. 219">{{Harvnb|Chapman|2000|p=219}}.</ref> The most recent historical use of the site was a substantial [[Old Serbia]]n [[necropolis]].<ref name="Tasic 1990"/>

==Tourism==
Vin<U+010D>a-Belo Brdo is classified as an [[Archaeological Sites of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)|Archaeological Site of Exceptional Importance]] by the Serbian government, entitling it to the highest level of state protection.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The site and ongoing excavations are part of the Vin<U+010D>a Archaeological Park and are open to the public in guided tours. Artefacts from the site are on display in exhibitions at the archaeological park, the [[National Museum of Serbia|National Museum of Belgrade]], the [[Belgrade City Museum]] and the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.belgradeeye.com/vinca.html |title=Vinca Archaeological Spot - Belgrade, Serbia |publisher=Belgrade Eye |accessdate=10 September 2010}}</ref>
