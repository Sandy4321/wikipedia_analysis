'''Douglas Wagner Bentley''' (September 3, 1916 <U+2013> November 24, 1972) was a Canadian [[ice hockey]] [[Winger (ice hockey)|left winger]] who played 13 seasons in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) for the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] and [[New York Rangers]] as part of a senior and professional career that spanned nearly three decades.  He was named to four [[NHL All-Star Team]]s in his career and was the [[List of past NHL scoring leaders|scoring leader]] in points and goals in [[1942<U+2013>43 NHL season|1942<U+2013>43]] and again in goals in [[1943<U+2013>44 NHL season|1943<U+2013>44]].

Bentley was one of six hockey playing brothers and at one point played with four of his brothers with the [[Drumheller Miners]] of the [[Alberta Senior Hockey League (1965<U+2013>78)|Alberta Senior Hockey League]].  He made NHL history when he played on the league's first all-brother line with [[Max Bentley|Max]] and [[Reg Bentley|Reg]] in 1943. Injuries forced him out of the NHL in 1951, but he returned in [[1953<U+2013>54 NHL season|1953<U+2013>54]] to play one last season for the Rangers with Max.  He spent several seasons as a player-coach for the [[Saskatoon Quakers]], leading the team to the [[Pacific Coast Hockey League]] championship in 1952.  Bentley was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1964.

==Early life==
Bentley was born March 1, 1920, in [[Delisle, Saskatchewan|Delisle]], Saskatchewan.  He was the fifth of six boys and one of thirteen children.  His father Bill was a native of [[Yorkshire]], England, who emigrated to the United States as a child and became a [[speed skating]] champion in [[North Dakota]] before settling in Delisle.<ref name="Rivalries">{{cite book |last=Batten |first=Jack |last2=Johnson |first2=George |last3=Duff |first3=Bob |last4=Milton |first4=Steve |last5=Hornby |first5=Lance |title=Hockey Dynasties: Blue lines and bloodlines |year=2002 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo |isbn=1-55297-676-9 |pages=14<U+2013>19}}</ref> He became mayor and helped build the town's covered skating rink.  All of the Bentley children were athletes, and all six brothers played hockey.<ref name="LOH1on1">{{cite web |last=Shea |first=Kevin |url=http://www.hhof.com/htmlSpotlight/spot_oneononep196601.shtml |title=One on one with Max Bentley |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |date=2010-01-15 |accessdate=2011-08-05}}</ref>  

Bill Bentley believed that all six boys could have played in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), though responsibilities on the family farm resulted in the eldest four boys spending the majority of their careers playing senior hockey on the [[Canadian Prairies]].<ref name="Rivalries" />  Doug was a small, slender player, weighing only 145&nbsp;lbs at the peak of his career,<ref name="PodnieksPlayers">{{cite book |last=Podnieks |first=Andrew |title=Players: The ultimate A<U+2013>Z guide of everyone who has ever played in the NHL |publisher=Doubleday Canada |year=2003 |location=Toronto |isbn=0-385-25999-9 |pages=58<U+2013>59}}</ref> but he was an exceptionally fast skater and his father taught him to use his speed to avoid larger opponents. He learned his trade with his brothers as they constantly played street hockey in the summers and on the ice in the winters.  Bentley's father flooded a sheet of ice that was the length of a regulation NHL [[Ice hockey rink|hockey rink]] but much narrower, forcing the boys to develop the ability to maintain control of the puck while making fast, hard turns to reach the net.<ref name="Rivalries" />

==Playing career==
===Senior hockey===
Bentley's early career was spent with several [[senior hockey|senior]] teams throughout Saskatchewan.  He first played in his hometown of Delisle for the Tigers hockey team in 1932<U+2013>33 before playing a year in [[Saskatoon]], then another in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] before settling in [[Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan|Moose Jaw]] for three seasons beginning in 1935<U+2013>36.<ref name="LOHStats">{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p196401&type=Player&page=statsawards&list= |title=Doug Bentley statistics |work=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> He led the South-[[Saskatchewan Senior Hockey League]] in scoring in 1936<U+2013>37 with 37 points and added another 14 in the playoffs, also leading the league.<ref name="OGHHOF">{{cite book |last=Duplacey |first=James |last2=Zweig |first2=Eric |title=Official Guide to the Players of the Hockey Hall of Fame |publisher=Firefly Books |year=2010 |isbn=1-55407-662-5 |page=45}}</ref> He moved to Alberta with brother [[Reg Bentley|Reg]], and joined elder brothers [[Max Bentley|Max]], Wyatt and Roy with the [[Drumheller Miners]] of the [[Alberta Senior Hockey League (1936<U+2013>41)|Alberta Senior Hockey League]] (ASHL) for the 1938<U+2013>39 season.  When not playing hockey, Doug helped run a gas station that the family purchased in Drumheller.<ref name="LOH1on1" />

===Chicago Black Hawks===
The [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] signed Bentley to a contract in the fall of 1939.  He had previously been placed on the protected list of the [[Montreal Canadiens]], meaning they were the only NHL team eligible to sign him to a contract.  They subsequently dealt his NHL rights to the [[Boston Bruins]] for [[Vic Myles]].  When he and brother Max went to Boston for a tryout camp, Bruins' owner [[Art Ross]] declared them "among the worst amateurs to come to my camp".<ref name="RLPByways">{{cite news |last=Dryburgh |first=Dave |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BZtTAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UzgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2870,5380771 |title=Along the sport byways |work=Regina Leader-Post |date=1939-10-27 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |page=20}}</ref> However, by the time Chicago signed him, Bentley had established himself as one of the top forwards on the prairies.<ref name="RLPByways" />

Bentley appeared in 39 games in his rookie campaign with Chicago, scoring 12 goals and 19 points.<ref name="LOHStats" />  His brother Max joined him early in the [[1940<U+2013>41 NHL season|1941<U+2013>42 season]], and the pair were placed on a line together.<ref name="PodnieksPlayers" />  After two years of development with the Black Hawks, Bentley emerged as the NHL's [[List of past NHL scoring leaders|scoring leader]] in [[1942<U+2013>43 NHL season|1942<U+2013>43]] with 73 points, a total that tied [[Cooney Weiland]]'s NHL record for points in a season.<ref>{{cite news |last=Edwards |first=Charles |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rDlkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CnwNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3324,2124295 |title=Proves to skeptics hockey honest sport |work=Calgary Herald |date=1943-03-22 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |page=10}}</ref>  He was the first Black Hawks player to finish as the scoring leader,<ref>{{cite news |last=Edwards |first=Charles |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-C9kAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_3sNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3061,693885 |title=Bentleys bring home bacon to Delisle |work=Calgary Herald |date=1943-04-07 |accessdate=2011-07-08-06 |page=15}}</ref> and finished second in voting for the [[Hart Memorial Trophy|Hart Trophy]] as most valuable player.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-S9kAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_3sNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1045,796068 |title=Hart Trophy goes to Bill Cowley |work=Calgary Herald |date=1943-04-08 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |page=14}}</ref> 

[[World War II]] had decimated the rosters of all NHL teams, and with the Black Hawks searching for players, Max and Doug convinced the team to sign their brother Reg.<ref name="LOH1on1" />  The trio made history on January 1, 1943, when they became the first all-brother line the NHL had seen.<ref name=l/> Two nights later, Max and Doug assisted on Reg's first, and only, NHL goal. It is the only time in league history that a trio of family members recorded the goal and assists on a scoring play.  While Max and Doug were established NHL stars, Reg played only 11 games in his NHL career.<ref name=l>{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=11973 |title=Reg Bentley profile |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2011-08-05}}</ref>

In [[1943<U+2013>44 NHL season|1943<U+2013>44]], Bentley again led the NHL in goal scoring with 38, and was named a [[NHL All-Star Team|First Team All-Star]] at left wing for the second consecutive season.<ref name="OGHHOF" />  His career was briefly halted in 1944 when, after playing an exhibition game with Chicago in Canada prior to the [[1944<U+2013>45 NHL season|1944<U+2013>45 season]], Canadian officials refused to allow him to return to the United States.<ref name="LOHBio">{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p196401&type=Player&page=bio&list= |title=Doug Bentley biography |work=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>  He was given permission by military authorities to return to his family farm for the duration of the war, and signed on to play with the Laura Beavers of the Saskatchewan Intermediate Hockey League.<ref name="LOHStats" />  The Beavers went on to win the western Canadian intermediate championship, defeating a team from [[Canmore, Alberta]], to capture the title.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W89TAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lTgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5019,144929 |title=Puck title for Laura |work=Regina Leader-Post |date=1945-04-02 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |page=14}}</ref>

Following the war, Bentley returned to the Black Hawks where he was reunited with his brother Max. The brothers and [[Bill Mosienko]] formed a line in which each player was small and exceptionally fast; they were dubbed the "Pony Line" and emerged as one of the top scoring lines in the league.<ref name="PodnieksPlayers" /> Max led the NHL in scoring with 61 points,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=epJjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QXoNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3423,1677411 |title=Max Bentley wins N.H.L. scoring title |work=Saskatoon Star-Phoenix |date=1946-03-19 |accessdate=2011-08-05 |page=11}}</ref> while Doug scored 40 points in just 36 games for Chicago.<ref name="LOHStats" /> He improved to 55 points in [[1946<U+2013>47 NHL season|1946<U+2013>47]] and was named a First Team All-Star for the third time.<ref name="OGHHOF" />  He played in the [[1st National Hockey League All-Star Game|first All-Star Game]] on October 13, 1947, for the NHL All-Stars, who defeated the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], 4<U+2013>3.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=S89TAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hzgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1266,1415143 |title=Mosienko costly All-Star Game injury |work=Regina Leader-Post |date=1947-10-14 |accessdate=2011-08-05 |page=19}}</ref>

The Black Hawks, who never iced a strong lineup while Bentley played,<ref name="WhosWho">{{cite book |last=Fischler |first=Stan |last2=Fischler |first2=Shirley |title=Who's Who in Hockey |year=2003 |publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing |location=Kansas City |isbn=0-7407-1904-1 |pages=27<U+2013>28}}</ref> made a significant trade early in the [[1947<U+2013>48 NHL season|1947<U+2013>48 season]].  They sent Max Bentley and a prospect to the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in exchange for five players.<ref name="TorontoTrade">{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o_4uAAAAIBAJ&sjid=R9wFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2258,679246 |title=Hawks trade Max Bentley for five Leafs |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=1947-11-04 |accessdate=2011-08-05 |page=17}}</ref>  The trade shocked Doug.  He thought about retiring following the deal but felt he could give Chicago at least one more good season.<ref name="WhosWho" /> He gave them several good seasons, finished the following three seasons with 57, 66 and 52 points respectively, was named to the Second All-Star Team in 1949, and appeared in four more [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star Games]] in 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1951.<ref name="OGHHOF" /> Chicago's ''[[Chicago's American|Herald American]]'' newspaper named him the city's top hockey player of the half-century in 1950.<ref name="PodnieksPlayers" />

===Saskatoon and New York===
Injuries, including a pulled groin muscle, plagued Bentley in [[1950<U+2013>51 NHL season|1950<U+2013>51]] and limited him to 44 games.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=t_8uAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nNwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4713,509717 |title=Lumley back |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=1951-02-03 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |page=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Bartlett |first=Charles |title=Hawks lose again, 4 to 1, to Rangers |work=Chicago Tribune |date=1951-03-02 |page=B3}}</ref>  He played only eight games of the [[1951<U+2013>52 NHL season]] before the Black Hawks allowed him to return to Saskatchewan.

Bentley remained with Saskatoon in 1952<U+2013>53, appearing in all 70 league games for the Quakers.<ref name="LOHStats" /> Following the season, the [[New York Rangers]] lured Bentley back to the NHL, acquiring his brother Max, then purchasing his rights from Chicago.  In his first game with the Rangers, he scored a goal and three assists.<ref name="Rivalries" />  He played 20 games with the Rangers, scoring 12 points,<ref name="LOH1on1" /> but returned to Saskatoon to coach the team in their playoffs once the Rangers' season ended.<ref>{{cite news |last=McKenzie |first=Cam |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4jNgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BG8NAAAAIBAJ&pg=6979,3163081 |title=Quakers, Flyers all set |work=Saskatoon Star-Phoenix |date=1954-03-23 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |page=13}}</ref>  Bentley continued as Saskatoon's player-coach until 1955.<ref name="VSResignation">{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nEBlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wokNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1105,1711383 |title=Bentley resigns as Quaker coach |work=Vancouver Sun |date=1956-01-12 |accessdate=2008-08-06 |page=20}}</ref>
