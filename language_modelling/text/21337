==History==
No. 114 Mobile Control and Reporting Unit was formed as No.&nbsp;14 (Mobile) Fighter Sector Headquarters at [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]], New South Wales, on 23&nbsp;May 1943, under the command of Wing Commander [[Gordon Steege]]. The following month it was deployed to [[Goodenough Island]] in [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] as part of [[No. 71 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;71 Wing]], and became operational on 27&nbsp;June. On 8&nbsp;August it moved to [[Kiriwina]], where it came under control of [[No. 73 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;73 Wing]]. Steege relinquished command on 1&nbsp;October to take charge of No.&nbsp;73 Wing. The unit was renamed No.&nbsp;114 (Mobile) Fighter Sector on 18&nbsp;October. It registered its first "kill" on the 31st, when a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] of [[No. 79 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;79 Squadron]] claimed a Japanese [[Kawasaki Ki-61|"Tony"]] fighter north-east of Kiriwina.  On 2&nbsp; March 1944, the unit redeployed with No.&nbsp;73 Wing from Goodenough to [[Los Negros Island]].<ref name=Units>RAAF Historical Section, ''Radar Units'', pp. 131<U+2013>138</ref> Responsible for coordinating air defence during the [[Admiralty Islands campaign]], it was renamed No.&nbsp;114 Mobile Fighter Control Unit (MFCU) five days later.<ref name=Units/><ref>Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awmohww2/air/vol2/awmohww2-air-vol2-ch11.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 173<U+2013>176]</ref> In January 1945, No.&nbsp;114 MFCU was withdrawn to [[Brisbane]] and began preparations to participate in the Australian-led [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|liberation of Tarakan]]. Travelling via [[Morotai]], it arrived off Tarakan with the main invasion force on 1&nbsp;May and became operational on the island four days after the landing, under the control of [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;78 Wing]].<ref name=Units/>

No.&nbsp;114 MFCU was rapidly reduced in size following the end of the war. It departed Tarakan for Australia on 3&nbsp;December 1945 with the rest of No.&nbsp;78 Wing, arriving at [[Deniliquin Airport|RAAF Station Deniliquin]], New South Wales, on the 14th. Still under the wing's control, it relocated to [[RAAF Station Schofields]] on 31&nbsp;May and then to [[RAAF Base Williamtown|RAAF Station Williamtown]] on 1&nbsp;August, disbanding on 1&nbsp;April 1948.<ref name=Units/> No.&nbsp;114 MFCU was re-established under a newly organised No.&nbsp;78 Wing on 24&nbsp;January 1949<U+2014>"in name only", as it remained non-operational.<ref name=Units/><ref>No. 78 Wing Headquarters, "Operations Record Book", p. 160</ref> It was reactivated in late 1955 and renamed No.&nbsp;114 Mobile Control and Reporting Unit (MCRU) on 12&nbsp;March 1956, relocating to [[Dubbo]] on 14&nbsp;November. In 1958 it deployed to [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], becoming operational at [[RMAF Butterworth|RAAF Base Butterworth]] on 19&nbsp;August. Here it controlled the [[CAC Sabre|Sabre]] fighters of [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&nbsp;3]] and [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|77 Squadrons]] and the [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] bombers of [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;2 Squadron]] in the last years of the [[Malayan Emergency]].<ref name=Units/> No.&nbsp;114 MCRU also sent controllers on attachment to [[Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base|Ubon Air Base]] in Thailand, where [[No. 79 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;79 Squadron]] was based from 1962.<ref name=Units/><ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 272<U+2013>273</ref> On 3&nbsp;September 1964, the unit went on to a 24-hour operational footing to support the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|Sidewinder-armed]] Sabres of Nos.&nbsp;3 and 77 Squadrons during the [[Indonesia<U+2013>Malaysia confrontation|''Konfrontasi'']] between Indonesia and Malaysia, though no combat ensued.<ref name=Units/><ref>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 251<U+2013>252</ref> No.&nbsp;114 MCRU transferred its responsibilities to RAF Western Hill on 22&nbsp;September 1966, and disbanded at Butterworth on 31&nbsp;October.<ref name=Units/>

The unit was reactivated again at [[RAAF Base Amberley]], Queensland, on 1&nbsp;April 1968, employing the Hubcap automated air defence system. In 1979 it upgraded to the Westinghouse [[AN/TPS-43]] radar system, improving its mobility and tactical capabilities. It began operating the Tactical Air Defence System (TADS) on 10&nbsp;July 1985.<ref name=Units/> No.&nbsp;114 MCRU was presented with a Squadron Standard on 23&nbsp;May 1990, becoming the RAAF's only non-flying unit to receive such an honour.<ref name=Units/><ref name=News>{{cite journal|url=http://digital.realviewtechnologies.com/default.aspx?xml=defencenews_airforce.xml|title=Big day for proud unit|work=Air Force, Vol. 55, No. 9|page=p. 7| date=6 June 2013|accessdate=on 6 June 2013}}</ref> It was transferred to [[RAAF Base Tindal]], Northern Territory, in May<U+2013>June 1997, and then to [[RAAF Base Darwin]] in December 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/About-us/Structure-of-the-RAAF/Air-Command/Surveillance-and-Response-Group/No.-41-Wing/No.-114-Mobile-Control-and-Reporting-Unit/?RAAF-+2dXErwePPuwhYHpunMpfKIZxfNVdxcd|title=No. 114 Mobile Control and Reporting Unit's History |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force|accessdate=on 4 June 2013}}</ref> The AN/TPS-43 was retired in September 2005, and replaced by the [[AN/FPS-117|AN/TPS-77]] radar.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4918/international/story1.htm |title=Radar<U+2019>s last hurrah|last= Johnson |first=Laura|coauthor=Maika, Jaimee |work=Air Force, Vol. 47, No. 17|date=22 September 2005|accessdate=on 6 June 2013}}</ref> In May 2007, a detachment of 75 members of No.&nbsp;114 MCRU deployed for active service at [[Kandahar Airfield]] in [[Operation Slipper|southern Afghanistan]], utilising the AN/TPS-77 to coordinate coalition combat air operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/media/download/2007/may/20070531/ |title=No. 114 Mobile Control and Reporting Unit deploys to Afghanistan|publisher=[[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]]|date=31 May 2007|accessdate=on 6 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4918/international/story1.htm |title=Kylie's in control|last= Jamieson|first=Cameron|work=Air Force, Vol. 49, No. 18|date=4 October 2007|accessdate=on 6 June 2013}}</ref> The detachment returned to Australia in August 2009.
