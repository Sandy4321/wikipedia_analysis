'''Helena National Forest''' is located in west-central [[Montana]], in the [[United States]]. Covering 976,000 acres (4,000 km&sup2;), the forest is broken into several separate sections. The eastern regions are dominated by the [[Big Belt Mountains]], and are the location of the [[Gates of the Mountains Wilderness]], which remains much as it did when the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] passed through the region. The western sections have both the [[continental divide]] and the [[Scapegoat Wilderness]] area, which is part of the [[Bob Marshall Wilderness]] complex. The southern region includes the [[Elkhorn Mountains]].The forest is comprised of a mixture of [[grass]] and [[sagebrush]] covered lowlands with "island" pockets of [[lodgepole pine]] and more mountainous areas where [[Douglas fir]], [[spruce]] and [[larch]] can be found. The [[rocky mountains]] in the region do not exceed 10,000 feet (3,000 m).

The [[grizzly bear]] has a sizeable sustained population in the northwestern section of the forest, especially in the Scapegoat Wilderness. [[American black bear| Black bear]]s are numerous as are [[Elk (Cervus canadensis)| elk]], [[moose]], [[mule deer]], and [[pronghorn| antelope]]. There are also small populations of [[bighorn sheep]] and [[mountain goat]]s. Along [[stream]]s and [[lake]]s, sightings of nesting [[bald eagle]]s and other [[bird]]s of prey are becoming more common due to protection of these [[species]] and their vitally important waterways.

700 miles (1100 km) of [[ hiking]] [[trail]]s are located in the forest along with numerous [[trout]] [[stream]]s and several [[lake]]s. There are over a dozen improved [[campground]]s. [[Snowmobile]] use is common in the [[winter]] months as is [[cross-country skiing]].

[[Interstate 15]] runs north-south and [[U.S. Route 12]] runs east-west through the area.
The largest nearby city is [[Helena, Montana|Helena]], [[Montana]], which is also the [[state capital]], and the headquarters location for the forest.

The forest was the site of the 1949 [[Mann Gulch fire]], which claimed the lives of 13 firefighters and which was the subject of [[Norman Maclean]]'s book [[Young Men and Fire]].
