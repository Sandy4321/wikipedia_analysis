Turner]]'s representation of the mass-murder of slaves, inspired by the ''Zong'' killings<ref>Burroughs 2010, p. 106.</ref>]]

The '''''Zong'' massacre''' was the mass killing of approximately 142&nbsp;[[Slavery|enslaved]] Africans by the crew of the [[slave ship]] ''Zong'' in the days following 29&nbsp;November 1781.<ref group=note>The exact number of deaths is unknown, but James Kelsall (the ''Zong''{{'s}} first mate) later said that "the outside number of drowned amounted to 142 in the whole" (quoted in Lewis 2007, p. 364).</ref> The ''Zong'' was owned by a [[Liverpool]] [[African slave trade|slave-trading]] syndicate that had taken out insurance on the lives of the slaves. When the ship ran low on water following navigational mistakes, the crew drowned some of the slaves in the sea. The owners of the ''Zong'' subsequently made a claim to their insurers for the loss of the slaves. When the insurers refused to pay, the resulting court cases held that in some circumstances the deliberate killing of slaves was legal, and that insurers could be required to pay for the slaves' deaths.

The hearings brought the massacre to the attention of the anti-slavery campaigner [[Granville Sharp]], who tried unsuccessfully to have the ship's crew prosecuted for murder. Reports of the massacre stimulated the nascent [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement, and became a powerful symbol of the horrors of the [[Middle Passage]] of slaves to the New World. The massacre has also inspired several works of art and literature, and was commemorated in 2007, the bicentenary of Britain's [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolition of the slave trade]].

== The ''Zong'' ==

The ''Zong'' had originally been named ''Zorgue'' (meaning "Care" in [[Netherlands|Dutch]]) by its owners, the [[Middelburgsche Commercie Compagnie]]. It operated as a slave ship based in [[Middelburg]], and had made a successful voyage to the coast of [[Surinam]] in 1777.<ref>Webster 2007, p. 287.</ref> The ''Zong'' was a "square [[stern]] ship" of 110&nbsp;[[Builder's Old Measurement|tons burden]].<ref name=Lewis365>Lewis 2007, p. 365.</ref> It was captured by a [[United Kingdom|British]] 16-gun ship named ''Alert'' on 10 February 1781. By 26 February, the ''Alert'' and ''Zong'' had arrived at [[Cape Coast Castle]], in modern-day [[Ghana]].<ref>Lewis 2007, p. 359.</ref>

In early March 1781, the ''Zong'' was purchased by the master of the ''William'', on behalf of a syndicate of Liverpool merchants.<ref name="Lewis 360">Lewis 2007, p. 360.</ref> The members of the syndicate were Edward Wilson, George Case, James Aspinall, and William, James and John Gregson.<ref name="Walvin 217">Walvin 2011, p. 217.</ref> William Gregson had had an interest in 50&nbsp;slaving voyages between 1747 and 1780, and had been mayor of Liverpool in 1762.<ref name="Lewis 358">Lewis 2007, p. 358.</ref> By the end of his life, vessels in which he had a financial stake had taken 58,201 people from Africa.<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 57.</ref>

The ''Zong'' was paid for with [[bills of exchange]], and the 244&nbsp;slaves already on board were part of the transaction.<ref name="Lewis 360"/> The ship was not insured until after it had started its voyage.<ref name=Lewis361>Lewis 2007, p. 361.</ref> The insurers, a syndicate from Liverpool, underwrote the ship and slaves for up to <U+00A3>8000, approximately half the slaves' potential market value. The remaining risk was borne by the owners.<ref name=Lewis361 /><ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 70<U+2013>1.</ref>

=== Crew ===

The ''Zong'' was the first command of Luke Collingwood, formerly the surgeon on the ''William''.<ref name="Lewis 358">Lewis 2007, pp. 358, 360.</ref> While Collingwood lacked experience in navigation and command, it was ship's surgeons who were involved in selecting slaves for purchase in Africa, knowing that those they rejected were liable to be killed. Sometimes these killings happened in the presence of the surgeon. It is likely, therefore, that Collingwood had already witnessed the mass-murder of slaves<U+2014>as the historian Jeremy Krikler has commented, this may have prepared him psychologically to participate in the massacre which occurred on the ''Zong''.<ref>Krikler 2007, p. 31.</ref><ref>Krikler 2012, p. 409.</ref><ref>Walvin 2011, p. 52.</ref> The ''Zong''{{'s}} first mate was James Kelsall, who had also served on the ''William''.<ref name="Lewis 358"/> The vessel's only passenger, Robert Stubbs, was the former governor of [[Fort William (fort)|Anomabu]], a British fortification near Cape Coast Castle, who had been forced to leave the position after nine months.<ref>Lewis 2007, pp. 359<U+2013>60.</ref><ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 76<U+2013>87.</ref> Witness statements gathered by the African Committee accused him of being a semi-literate drunkard who mismanaged the slave-trading activities of the fort.<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 82<U+2013>3.</ref>

The ''Zong'' had a 17-man crew when it left Africa, which was far too small to maintain adequate sanitary conditions on the ship.<ref name="Krikler 411">Krikler 2012, p. 411.</ref> Mariners willing to risk disease and slave rebellions on slave ships were difficult to recruit within Britain,<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 45<U+2013>8.</ref> and were even harder to find for a vessel captured from the Dutch off the coast of Africa.<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 69.</ref> The ''Zong'' was manned with remnants of the previous Dutch crew and the crew of the ''William'', and with unemployed sailors from the settlements along the African coast.<ref name=Lewis361/>

== The Middle Passage ==

[[File:Slaveshipposter.jpg|thumb|upright |alt=A plan of the slave ship Brookes, showing the extreme overcrowding experienced by slaves on the Middle Passage |Plan of the slave ship ''[[Brookes (ship)|Brookes]]''. The ''Brookes'' carried 609 slaves and was 267&nbsp;tons burden, making 2.3 slaves per ton. The ''Zong'' carried 442 slaves and was 110&nbsp;tons burden<U+2014>4.0 slaves per ton.<ref name="Walvin 27">Walvin 2011, p. 27.</ref>]]

The ''Zong'' had taken on more slaves than it could safely transport when it sailed from [[Accra]] with 442&nbsp;slaves on 18&nbsp;August 1781.<ref name=Lewis361 /> In the 1780s, British-built ships typically carried 1.75&nbsp;slaves per ton of the ship's capacity; on the ''Zong'', the ratio was four per ton.<ref>Webster 2007, p. 289.</ref> A British slave ship of the period would carry around 193&nbsp;slaves, and it was extremely unusual for a ship of the ''Zong''{{'s}} relatively small size to carry so many.<ref name="Walvin 27"/>

After taking on drinking water at [[S<U+00E3>o Tom<U+00E9> and Pr<U+00ED>ncipe|S<U+00E3>o Tom<U+00E9>]], the ''Zong'' began its voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to [[Jamaica]] on 6&nbsp;September. On 18&nbsp;or 19&nbsp;November the ship neared [[Tobago]] in the Caribbean, but failed to stop there to replenish its water supplies.<ref>Lewis 2007, pp. 362<U+2013>3.</ref>

It is unclear who, if anyone, was in charge of the ship at this point.<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 90.</ref> The captain, Luke Collingwood, had been gravely ill for some time.<ref name="Walvin 87">Walvin 2011, p. 87.</ref> The man who would normally have replaced him, first mate James Kelsall, had been suspended from duty following an argument on 14&nbsp;November.<ref name="Walvin 87"/> Robert Stubbs had captained a slave ship several decades earlier, and he temporarily commanded the ''Zong'' in Collingwood's absence, despite not being a member of the vessel's crew.<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 77, 88.</ref> According to James Walvin, the breakdown of the command structure on the ship might explain why subsequent navigational errors were committed, and why checks on supplies of drinking water were not made.<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 89<U+2013>90.</ref>

=== Massacre ===

[[File:Zong Massacre map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3||alt=Map of the Caribbean, showing Tobago, Hispaniola and Jamaica |Map of the Caribbean, showing Tobago, Hispaniola (red) and Jamaica (blue)]]

On 27&nbsp;or 28&nbsp;November, Jamaica was sighted at a distance of {{convert|27|nmi|km mi}}, but was misidentified as the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] on the island of [[Hispaniola]].<ref name="Lewis 363">Lewis 2007, p. 363.</ref><ref>Walvin 2011, p. 92.</ref> The ''Zong'' continued on its westward course, leaving Jamaica behind. This mistake was only recognised when the ship was {{convert|300|mi|km}} [[leeward]] of the island.<ref name="Lewis 363"/>

Overcrowding, malnutrition, accidents and disease had already killed several mariners and approximately 62&nbsp;enslaved Africans.<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 89, 97.</ref> James Kelsall later claimed that there was only four days' water remaining on the ship when the navigational error was discovered, with Jamaica still 10<U+2013>13 days away.<ref>Oldham 2007, p. 299.</ref>

If the slaves died onshore, the Liverpool ship-owners would have no redress from their insurers. Similarly, if the slaves died a "natural death" (as the contemporary term put it) at sea, then insurance could not be claimed. But if some slaves were jettisoned in order to save the rest of the "cargo" or the ship itself, then a claim could be made under the notion of "[[general average]]".<ref>Webster 2007, p. 291.</ref> The ship's insurance covered the loss of slaves at <U+00A3>30&nbsp;a head.<ref name=Weisbord562>Weisbord 1969, p. 562.</ref>

On 29&nbsp;November, the crew assembled to consider the proposal that some of the slaves should be thrown overboard.<ref name="Walvin 97">Walvin 2011, p. 97.</ref> James Kelsall later claimed that he had disagreed with the plan at first, but it was soon unanimously agreed.<ref name=Weisbord562 /><ref name="Walvin 97"/> On 29&nbsp;November, 54&nbsp;women and children were thrown through cabin windows into the sea.<ref name=Lewis364>Lewis 2007, p. 364.</ref> On 1&nbsp;December, 42&nbsp;male slaves were thrown overboard; 36&nbsp;slaves followed in the next few days.<ref name=Lewis364 /> Another ten, in a display of defiance at the inhumanity of the slavers, threw themselves overboard.<ref name=Lewis364 /> Having heard the shrieks of the victims as they were thrown into the water, one slave requested that the remaining Africans be denied all food and drink rather than be thrown into the sea. This request was ignored by the crew.<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 98, 157<U+2013>8.</ref> The account of the King's Bench trial reports that one slave managed to climb back onto the ship.<ref name="Rupprecht 268"/>

It was subsequently claimed that the slaves had been jettisoned because the ship did not have enough water to keep all the slaves alive for the rest of the voyage. This claim was later disputed, as the ship had {{convert|420|impgal|l}} of water left when it arrived in Jamaica on 22&nbsp;December.<ref name=Weisbord562 /> In an affidavit made by Kelsall it was reported that on 1&nbsp;December, when 42&nbsp;slaves were killed, it rained heavily for more than a day, allowing six casks of water (sufficient for eleven days) to be collected.<ref name=Weisbord562 /><ref>Lewis 2007, p. 366.</ref>

=== Subsequent history of the ''Zong'' ===

On 22 December 1781, the ''Zong'' arrived at [[Black River, Jamaica|Black River]], Jamaica, with 208&nbsp;slaves on board, less than half the number taken from Africa.<ref name=Lewis364 /> The slaves sold for an average price of <U+00A3>36 each.<ref name=Lewis365 /> The legality of the ''Zong''{{'s}} capture from the Dutch was confirmed by the Jamaican Vice-Admiralty court, and the vessel was renamed ''Richard of Jamaica''.<ref name=Lewis365 /> Luke Collingwood died three days after the ''Zong'' reached Jamaica, and thus was unable to testify at the 1783 court proceedings.<ref>Webster 2007, p. 288.</ref>

== Legal proceedings ==

[[File:William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield by John Singleton Copley.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Portrait of William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, wearing the robes and ceremonial wig of the Lord Chief Justice|[[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield]] in the robes of the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]]]]

When the news of the ''Zong''{{'s}} voyage reached England, the ship's owners tried to claim compensation from their insurers for the loss of the slaves. However, the insurers refused to honour the claim, and were taken to court by the Liverpool syndicate.<ref name="Walvin 2011 102 3">Walvin 2011, pp. 102<U+2013>3.</ref> The [[logbook]] of the ''Zong'' went missing before the hearings started; the legal proceedings provide almost all the documentary evidence about the massacre. The ship's insurers claimed that the log had been deliberately destroyed, which the Gregson syndicate denied.<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 85<U+2013>7, 140<U+2013>1.</ref>

Almost all the surviving source material is of questionable reliability. The two eyewitnesses who gave evidence, John Stubbs and James Kelsall, were strongly motivated to exonerate themselves from blame.<ref group=note>Stubbs gave evidence in court; Kelsall produced a sworn [[affidavit]] in the [[Exchequer of Pleas|Exchequer]] proceedings initiated by the insurers (Walvin 2011, pp. 85, 155).</ref> It is possible that the figures concerning the number of slaves killed, the amount of water which remained on the ship, and the distance beyond Jamaica which the ''Zong'' had mistakenly sailed are all inaccurate.<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 95.</ref>

=== First trial ===

Legal proceedings began when the insurers refused to compensate the owners of the ''Zong''. The dispute was initially tried at the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] in London on 6&nbsp;March 1783, with the [[Lord Chief Justice]], the [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Earl of Mansfield]], overseeing the trial.<ref name="Walvin 2011 102 3"/> Robert Stubbs was the only witness, and the jury found in favour of the owners.<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 103, 139, 142.</ref>

On 19&nbsp;March 1783, [[Olaudah Equiano]], a freed slave, told the anti-slave-trade activist [[Granville Sharp]] of the events aboard the ''Zong'',<ref>Lovejoy 2006, pp. 337, 344.</ref> and Sharp sought legal advice on the following day about the possibility of prosecuting the ship's crew for murder.<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 164.</ref>

=== King's Bench appeal ===

[[File:Granville Sharp (Hoare memoire).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Portrait of Granville Sharp. The head and shoulders of Sharp are seen from the side, in an oval frame|Granville Sharp, from a drawing by [[George Dance the Younger|George Dance]]]]

The insurers of the ''Zong'' applied to the Earl of Mansfield to have the previous verdict set aside, and for the case to be tried again.<ref>Lewis 2007, pp. 365<U+2013>6.</ref> A hearing was held at the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]] in [[Westminster Hall]] on 21<U+2013>22 May 1783, before Mansfield and two other justices.<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 138.</ref> The [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]], [[John Lee (Attorney-General)|John Lee]], appeared on behalf of the ''Zong''{{'s}} owners, as he had done previously in the Guildhall trial.<ref name=Weisbord563>Weisbord 1969, p. 563.</ref> Granville Sharp was also in attendance, as was the secretary he had employed to take a written record of the proceedings.<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 139.</ref>

Summing up the verdict reached in the first trial, Mansfield declared that the jury:

<blockquote>had no doubt (thought it shocks one very much) that the Case of Slaves was the same as if Horses had been thrown over board&nbsp;... The Question was, whether there was not an Absolute Necessity for throwing them over board to save the rest, [and] the Jury were of opinion there was&nbsp;...<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 153.</ref><ref>Krikler 2007, p. 36.</ref></blockquote>

The only witness of the ''Zong'' massacre to appear at Westminster Hall was Robert Stubbs, although a written statement by James Kelsall was made available to the lawyers.<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 144, 155.</ref> Stubbs claimed that there was "an absolute Necessity for throwing over the Negroes", because the crew feared all the slaves would die if they did not throw some into the sea.<ref name="Walvin 144">Walvin 2011, p. 144.</ref> The insurers of the ''Zong'' argued that Collingwood had made "a Blunder and Mistake" in sailing beyond Jamaica, and that the slaves had been killed so their owners could claim compensation.<ref name="Walvin 144"/> They alleged that Collingwood did this because he did not want his first voyage as a slave ship captain to be unprofitable.<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 144<U+2013>5.</ref> John Lee responded by saying that the slaves "perished just as a Cargo of Goods perished", and were jettisoned for the greater good of the ship.<ref name="Walvin 146">Walvin 2011, p. 146.</ref> The insurers' legal team replied that Lee's argument could never justify the killing of innocent people, and that the actions of the ''Zong''{{'s}} crew were nothing less than murder.<ref name="Walvin 146"/> As James Walvin has argued, it is possible that Granville Sharp directly influenced the strategy that the insurers' legal team employed.<ref name="Walvin 146"/>

At the hearing it was revealed that heavy rain had fallen on the ship during the series of killings. This led Mansfield to order another trial, because the rainfall meant that the killing of the slaves after the water shortage had been eased could not be justified in terms of the greater necessity of saving the ship and the rest of its human cargo.<ref>Krikler 2007, pp. 36<U+2013>8.</ref><ref>Walvin 2011, p. 155.</ref> One of the justices in attendance also stated that the evidence they had heard invalidated the findings of the jury in the first trial, which had been told that the water shortage resulted from the poor condition of the ship brought on by unforeseen maritime conditions, rather than from errors committed by its captain.<ref>Oldham 2007, pp. 313<U+2013>4.</ref> Mansfield concluded that the insurers were not liable for losses resulting from errors committed by the ''Zong''{{'s}} crew.<ref name=Krikler38/>

There is no evidence that a further trial occurred.<ref>Krikler 2007, p. 37.</ref><ref>Weisbord 1969, p. 564.</ref> Despite Sharp's efforts, nobody was prosecuted for the murder of the slaves.<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 167.</ref>

=== Mansfield's motivations ===

Jeremy Krikler has argued that Mansfield wanted to ensure that commercial law remained as helpful to Britain's overseas trade as possible, and as a consequence was keen to uphold the principle of "general average", even in relation to the killing of humans. This principle holds that a captain who jettisons part of his cargo in order to save the rest can claim for the loss from his insurers. Finding in favour of the insurers would, therefore, have greatly undermined this idea.<ref>Krikler 2007, pp. 32<U+2013>3, 36<U+2013>8, 42.</ref> The revelation that it had rained heavily before the massacre had finished enabled Mansfield to order a retrial while leaving the notion of "general average" intact. He emphasised that the killings would have been legally justified and the owners' insurance claim would have been valid had the water shortage not arisen from mistakes made by the captain.<ref name=Krikler38>Krikler 2007, p. 38.</ref>

In reaching these conclusions, Krikler comments that Mansfield ignored the ruling of his predecessor, [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]], that the killing of innocents in the name of self-preservation was unlawful. This ruling was to prove important a century later in ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', which also concerned the justifiability of acts of murder at sea.<ref>Krikler 2007, p. 39.</ref> Mansfield also did not acknowledge another important legal principle<U+2014>that no insurance claim can be legal if it arose from an illegal act.<ref>Krikler 2007, pp. 42<U+2013>3.</ref>

== Impact on the abolitionist movement ==

Granville Sharp campaigned actively to raise awareness of the massacre, writing letters to newspapers, the [[Lords Commissioners of Admiralty]], and the Prime Minister (the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]]).<ref>Weisbord 1969, pp. 565<U+2013>7.</ref><ref name="Rupprecht 336">Rupprecht, "A Very Uncommon Case" (2007), p. 336.</ref> Neither Portland nor the Admiralty sent him a reply.<ref name="Rupprecht 336"/> The first ''Zong'' trial in March 1783 was only reported by a single London newspaper, and very little about the massacre appeared in print before 1787.<ref name="Swaminathan 2010, p. 483"/><ref name="Drescher 575<U+2013>6"/> Moreover, the newspaper article in March 1783 represented the first public report of the massacre, appearing almost 18&nbsp;months after the event.<ref name="Swaminathan 2010, p. 485">Swaminathan 2010, p. 485.</ref>

Despite these setbacks, Sharp's efforts did have some success. In April 1783 he sent an account of the ''Zong'' massacre to [[William Dillwyn]], a [[Quaker]], who had asked to see evidence which was critical of the slave trade. The [[Britain Yearly Meeting|London Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends]] decided shortly after to begin campaigning against slavery, and a petition signed by 273&nbsp;Quakers was submitted to parliament in July 1783.<ref>Rupprecht, "A Very Uncommon Case" (2007), pp. 336<U+2013>7.</ref> Sharp also sent letters to [[Anglican]] bishops and clergymen, and to those already sympathetic to the abolitionist cause.<ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 170<U+2013>1.</ref>

The immediate impact of the ''Zong'' massacre on public opinion was very limited, demonstrating<U+2014>as the historian of abolitionism [[Seymour Drescher]] has noted<U+2014>the challenge that the early abolitionists faced.<ref name="Drescher 575<U+2013>6">Drescher 2012, pp. 575<U+2013>6.</ref> But following Sharp's efforts, the ''Zong'' massacre became an important topic in abolitionist literature, and the massacre was discussed by [[Thomas Clarkson (abolitionist)|Thomas Clarkson]], [[Ottobah Cugoano]], [[James Ramsay (abolitionist)|James Ramsay]] and [[John Newton]].<ref>Lovejoy 2006, p. 337.</ref><ref>Swaminathan 2010, pp. 483<U+2013>4.</ref> These accounts often omitted the names of the ship and its captain, thereby creating, in the words of Srividhya Swaminathan, "a portrait of abuse that could be mapped onto any ship in the Middle Passage".<ref name ="Swaminathan 484">Swaminathan 2010, p. 484.</ref><ref>Rupprecht, "Excessive memories" (2007), p. 14.</ref> The ''Zong'' killings offered a powerful example of the horrors of the slave trade that stimulated the development of the abolitionist movement in Britain, which dramatically expanded in size and influence in the late 1780s.<ref name="Swaminathan 2010, p. 485"/><ref>Walvin 2011, pp. 176<U+2013>9.</ref><ref>Rupprecht, "A Very Uncommon Case" (2007), pp. 330<U+2013>1.</ref>

Descriptions of the massacre on the ''Zong'' continued to appear in abolitionist literature in the nineteenth century. In 1839, Thomas Clarkson published his ''History of the Rise, Progress, and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the African Slave Trade'', which included an account of the ''Zong'' killings.<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 10.</ref><ref name="Boime 36">Boime 1990, p. 36.</ref> Clarkson's book had an important influence on the artist [[J. M. W. Turner]], who displayed a painting at the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]] in 1840 entitled ''[[The Slave Ship]]''. The painting depicts a vessel from which a number of manacled slaves have been thrown into the sea to be devoured by sharks. Some of the details in the painting, such as the [[Legcuffs|shackles]] worn by the slaves, appear to have been directly influenced by the illustrations in Clarkson's book.<ref name="Boime 36"/> The painting appeared at an important moment in the ongoing movement to abolish slavery worldwide, with the Royal Academy exhibition opening one month before the first [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] met in London.<ref>Walvin 2011, p. 6.</ref><ref>Boime 1990, p. 34.</ref> The painting was admired by its owner, [[John Ruskin]], and has been described by the critic Marcus Wood as one of the few truly great depictions of the Atlantic slave trade in Western art.<ref>Wood 2000, p. 41.</ref>

== In modern culture ==

[[File:Slave ship tower bridge 2007.jpg|thumb|alt=A sailing ship sits moored on the River Thames, with a large bridge in the background|''[[Kaskelot (tall ship)|Kaskelot]]'', appearing as the ''Zong'', at [[Tower Bridge]] during commemoration of the 200th anniversary of abolition in 2007]]

The ''Zong'' has inspired several works of literature. [[Fred D'Aguiar]]'s novel ''Feeding the Ghosts'' (1997) tells the story of an enslaved African who survives being thrown overboard from the ''Zong''. In the novel, the journal of the slave<U+2014>Mintah<U+2014>is lost, unlike that of Granville Sharp. According to the cultural historian Anita Rupprecht, this signifies the silencing of African voices about the massacre.<ref name="Rupprecht 268">Rupprecht 2008, p. 268.</ref> [[M. NourbeSe Philip]]'s 2008 poetry book, ''Zong!'', is based on the events surrounding the massacre, and uses the account of the King's Bench hearing as its source.<ref name="Rupprecht 268"/>

Episode 1 of the second series of the television programme ''[[Garrow's Law]]'' is loosely based on the legal events arising from the massacre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00w5c5g BBC |title=Garrow's Law |publisher=BBC |accessdate=28 December 2012}}</ref> The historical [[William Garrow]] did not take part in the case, and because the ''Zong''{{'s}} captain died shortly after arriving in Jamaica, his appearance in court for fraud is likewise fictional.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/nov/12/garrows-law-court-dramas|title= TV & Radio Blog: Law draws from real-life court dramas|author= Mark Pallis|date=12 November 2010 |publisher=''The Guardian''|accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref>
