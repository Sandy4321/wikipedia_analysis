The current [[Tajik Republic]] hearkens back to the [[Samanid]] Empire ([[Anno Domini|AD]] [[875]]&ndash;[[999]]).  The [[Tajik people]] came under [[Russia]]n rule in the 1860. Tajikistan became an autonomous Soviet socialist republic within [[Uzbekistan]] in 1924; ''[[Basmachi]]'' resistance in the wake of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] was quelled in  1925 and, and Tajikistan became one of the component Soviet socialist republics in 1929 called [[Tadzhik SSR]] from [[1936]] to [[1991]].

Tajikistan gained independence in 1991, and has experienced three changes in government and a [[Tajik civil war|civil war]] since then. A peace agreement among rival factions was signed in [[1997]] but its implementation has progressed slowly.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

==Pre-Islamic Period (600 BC&ndash;AD 651)==
Tajikistan was part of the [[Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex]] in the Bronze Age, candidate for [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]] or [[Proto-Iranian]] culture. Tajikistan was part of [[Scythia]] in Classical Antiquity.

[[Sogdiana]], [[Bactria]], [[Merv]] and [[Khorezm]] were the four principal divisions of Ancient Central Asia inhabited by the ancestors of the present-day Tajiks. Tajiks are now found only in historic Bactria and Sogdiana. Merv is inhabited by the [[Turkmen people|Turkoman]] and Khorezm by [[Karakalpaks]], [[Uzbeks]] and [[Kazakhs]]. The Sogdians were famous for being tall, massive, and of a fair colour, possibly resembling the Scythians.  Among them Bactria and Khorezm were kingdoms during different period of history unlike Sogdiana and Merv which were geographical locations and vassals of different kingdoms.  Sogdiana was made up of the [[Zeravshan]] and [[Kashka-Darya]] river valleys. Currently, One of the surviving peoples of Sogdiana who speak a dialect of the Sogdian language are the [[Yaghnob]]is and [[Shighnan|Shugnan]]is who live in the Northern region of Tajikistan around the [[Zeravshan]] valley. Bactria was located in northern [[Afghanistan]] (present-day [[Afghan Turkestan]]) between the mountain range of the [[Hindu Kush]] and the [[Amu Darya]] ([[Oxus]]) River and some areas of current south Tajikistan. During different periods Bactria was a center of various Kingdoms or Empires, and is probably where [[Zoroastrianism]] originated. The "[[Avesta]]" the holy book of Zoroastrianism was written in the old-Bactrian dialect; it is also thought that Zoroaster was most likely born in Bactria.  Khorezm was a powerful Kingdom during some periods of its history, and is located south-east of the Aral Sea in what archeological discoveries indicated used to be a very fertile area.  Merv is located in the Amu-Darya basin south of Khorezm.

===Achaemenid Period (550 BC&ndash;329 BC)===
[[Image:Achaemenid Empire.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Achaemenid empire at its greatest extent]]
During the [[Achaemenids|Achaemenid period]], Sogdiana was one of the provinces of the [[Persian empire]]. Among the cities of Tajikistan, [[Panjakent]] and [[Istarawshan]] are founded in that period.

===Hellenistic Period (329 BC&ndash;90 BC)===
{{details|Greco-Bactrian Kingdom}}
[[Image:Map-alexander-empire.png|thumb|300px|left|Map of Alexander's empire.]]
After the Persian Empire was defeated by [[Alexander the Great]], Bactria, Sogdiana and Merv, being part of Persian Empire, had to defend themselves from new invaders.  In fact the Macedonians faced very stiff resistance under the leadership of Sogdian ruler [[Spitamenes]]. [[Alexander the Great]] managed to marry [[Roxana]], the daughter of a local ruler, and inherited the land(?). Following Alexander's brief occupation, the [[Hellenistic]] successor states of the Seleucids and [[Greco-Bactrians]] controlled the area for another 200 years in what is known as the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]]. During the time period from [[90 BC]] to [[30 BC]] the Eastern Scythians destroyed the last Hellenistic [[successor states]] and, together with the Tocharians, (to whom they were closely related) created a [[Kushan]] Empire around 30 AD.

===Kushan Empire (30 BC&ndash;AD 410)===
For another 400 years, until [[Anno Domini|AD]] 410, the Kushan Empire would be a major power in the region along with the Roman Empire, the [[Parthia|Parthian]] Empire and the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] Empire ([[China]]).  At the end of the Kushan period, the Empire became much smaller and would have to defend itself from the powerful [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid]] Empire that replaced the Parthian Empire. The famous Kushan [[Shah]] Kanishka promoted Buddhism and during this time Buddhism was exported from Central Asia to China.

===The Hephthalites (AD 410&ndash;565)===
The [[Hephthalites]] are considered to be another Scythian-related tribe although there is controversy about their name (which means '[[White Hun]]') which normally refers to Mongolian-Turkish invaders. As later archeologists discovered, there are many factors that proved that Hephthalites were a branch of the Scythians.  The Hephthalites were destroyed in 565 AD by a combination of [[Sassanid]] and [[G<U+00F6>kt<U+00FC>rks|K<U+00F6>k-Turk]] forces.

===G<U+00F6>kt<U+00FC>rk Rule (565&ndash;658)===
The origin of the [[G<U+00F6>kt<U+00FC>rks]] is uncertain, but it seems likely that they had lived to the South of the Altai Mountains until the year 542 AD. Chinese sources suggest that they were descended from the Huns and located to the North of them. (The Huns being another proto-Turkish tribe?).

==Islamic Empires (710&ndash;1218)==
===Arab Caliphate (710&ndash;867)===
[[Image:Age-of-caliphs.png|225px|thumb|right|The Age of the Caliphs {{legend|#a1584e|Prophet Mohammad, 622-632}} {{legend|#ef9070|Patriarchal Caliphate, 632-661}} {{legend|#fad07d|Umayyad Caliphate, 661-750}}]]
The Transoxiana principalities never formed a viable confederacy. Beginning in 651 AD, the Arabs organized periodic marauding raids deep into the territory of Transoxania, but it was not until the appointment of Ibn Qutaiba as Governor of [[Khorasan]] in 705 AD, during the reign of Walid I, that the Caliphate adopted the policy of annexing the lands beyond the Oxus. In 715 AD the task of annexation was accomplished.  The entire region thus came under the control of the [[Caliph]] and of Islam, but the Arabs continued to rule through local Soghdian Kings and ''dihqans''. The ascension of the [[Abbasids]] to rule the Caliphate (750 - 1258) opened a new era in the history of Central Asia. While their predecessors the [[Umayyads]] (661 - 750) were little more than leaders of a loose confederation of Arab tribes, the Abbasids set out to build a huge multi-ethnic centralized state that would emulate and perfect the Sassanian government machine. They gave the Near East and Transoxiana a unity, which they had been lacking since the time of Alexander the Great.

===Samanid Empire (900&ndash;999)===
For many years before the Arab invasion Central Asia was divided into many different regions such as the Kingdom of Merv, Sogdiana, Bactria, Khorezm, [[Badakhshan]]: the only exception was Kushan Empire that was now reduced to parts of eastern [[Iran]]. [[Islam]] spread rapidly in Transoxiana. The new religion was received mostly by popular acclaim, for it promised greater social mobility and created favourable conditions for trade. With Islam there came [[Arabic language|Arabic]] that became  the language of Abbasid court. It must also have stimulated the emergence of the Modern Persian language ([[Dari]]), in which the share of loan-words from Arabic fluctuated from 10 percent in the vocabulary of [[Rudaki]] (9th to 10th centuries) to 40 percent in the writings of Baihaqi (11th century). All in all, "the volume of Arabic lexicon, its share in the vocabulary of the Dari language remained exceptionally high until the first quarter of the nineteenth century."

The Samanid dynasty, that ruled (819&ndash;1005) in Khorasan (Eastern Iran) and Transoxiana, was founded by Saman-[[Khuda]] . The Samanids were one of the first purely indigenous dynasties to rule in Persia following the Muslim Arab conquest. Not until the reign (892&ndash;907) of Saman-Khuda's great-grandson, Ismail I,. did Samanid power become extensive. In 900, Ismail defeated Saffarids in Khorasan (area of current Northwest Afghanistan and northeastern Iran), while his brother was the governor of Transoxiana. Thus, Samanid rule was acclaimed over the combined regions. The cities of Bukhara (the Samanid capital) and Samarkand became centres of art, science, and literature; industries included pottery making and bronze casting. After 950, Samanid power weakened, but was briefly revitalized under Nuh II, who ruled from 976 to 997. However, with the oncoming encroachment of Muslim [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] into the Abbasid Empire, the Samanids were effectively defeated; in 999, Bukhara fell under a combined force of [[Ghaznavids]] and [[Qarakhanids]]. Ismail II,d. 1005, the last ruler of the dynasty, briefly fought (1000&ndash;1005) to retain Samanid territory, until he was assassinated.

Although short during this period art and science of the Tajiks flourished, and many scholars of this period are still very highly regarded, notably [[Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna).  The modern state of Tajikistan considers that the Tajik name and identity, although in existence for thousands of years in this area, began its formation during the Samanid period. 

The attack of the Qarakhanid Turks ended the Samanids' reign and Samanid era civilization in 999 and dominance in Transoxiana passed on to Turkic rulers for nine centuries to come. 

===Qarakhanids (999&ndash;1211) and Khwarezmshahs (1211&ndash;1218)===
After the collapse of Samanid Dynasty Central Asia became the battleground of many Asian invaders who came from the north-east.  

==The Mongols and their successors (1218&ndash;1740)==
===Mongol Empire (1218&ndash;1370)===
The [[Mongol Empire]] swept through Central Asia invaded Khorezm and sacked the cities of Bukhara and Samarkand, looting and massacring people everywhere. 

===Timurid Empire (1370&ndash;1506)===
Timur, founder of the [[Timurid Empire]], was born on [[8 April]] [[1336]] in [[Shahrisabz|Kesh]] near Samarkand. He was a member of the Turkicized Barlas tribe, a Mongol subgroup that had settled in [[Transoxiana]] after taking part in [[Genghis Khan]]'s son [[Chagatai]]'s campaigns in that region.  Timur began his life as a bandit leader. During this period, he received an arrow-wound in the leg, as a result of which he was nicknamed Timur-e Lang (in Dari) or Timur the Lame, corrupted in the West to Tamerlane. Although the last Timurid ruler of Herat, Badi az Zaman finally fell to the armies of the Uzbek Muhammad Shaibani Khan in 1506, the Timurid ruler of Ferghana, Zahir-ud-Din [[Babur]], survived the collapse of the dynasty and re-established the [[Timurid dynasty]] in India in 1526, where they became known as the [[Mughal]]s.

===Shaybanid rule (1506&ndash;1598)===
The [[Shaybanid]] state was divided into [[appanage]]s between all male members (sultans) of the dynasty, who would designate the supreme ruler (Khan), the oldest member of clan. The seat of Khan was first Samarkand, the capital of the Timurids, but some of the Khans preferred to remain in their former appanages. Thus Bukhara became the seat of the khan for the first time under Ubaid Allah Khan (r.1533-1539).

===The Astrakhanid (Janid) dynasty (1598&ndash;1740)===
The period of political expansion and economical prosperity was short-lived. Soon after the death of Abd Allah Khan the Shaibanid dynasty died out, to be replaced by the Janid or [[Astrakhanid]] (Ashtarkhanid) dynasty, another branch of the descendants of [[Jochi|J<U+00F6>chi]] whose founder was related through marriage to Abd Allah Khan.  
  
==Persian and Bukharan rule (1740&ndash;1920)==
===Afsharid dynasty (1740&ndash;1756)===
In 1740 the Janid khanate was conquered by [[Nadir Shah]], the [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]] ruler of [[Persian Empire|Persia]]. The Janid khan Abu al Faiz retained his throne, becoming Nadir's vassal.
Sulaymons were the best

===Manghit dynasty (1756&ndash;1920)===
After the death of Nadir Shah in 1747, the chief of the [[Manghit]] tribe, Muhammad Rahim Biy Azaliq, overcame his rivals from other tribes with the support of the urban population, consolidated his rule in the [[Khanate of Bukhara]], and was proclaimed khan in 1756. His successor, however, ruled in the name of puppet khans of Janid origin.  The third Manghit ruler, Shah Murad (r.1785&ndash;1800), finally deposed the Janids and acceded to the throne himself. He did not assume the title of khan, preferring the title [[emir]], as did subsequent Manghit rulers, because they were not of [[Genghisid]] descent. The [[Emirate of Bukhara]] was smaller under the Manghits than the khanate under their predecessors; it lost important provinces to the south of Amu Darya and the Syr Darya basin, and Merv, conquered by Shah Murad in 1785&ndash;1789, was lost in 1823. Under the Manghits the administration of the country was more centralized.

==Modern History: 1800s&ndash;Present==
===Russian Vassalage (1868&ndash;1920)===
Conflict with Russia started in 1865, shortly after Russian conquest of Tashkent. Being more technologically advanced the Russians had little difficulty in conquering the regions inhabited by Tajiks, meeting fierce resistance only at [[Jizzakh]], [[Ura-Tyube]], and when their garrison at [[Samarkand]] was besieged in [[1868]] by forces from [[Shahr-e Sabz]] and the inhabitants of the city. The army of the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] was utterly defeated in three battles, and on 18 June 1868 Amir Muzaffar al Din (r.1860-1885) signed a peace treaty with the [[Governor-general]] of [[Russian Turkestan]], [[Konstantin Petrovich Von Kaufman]]. Samarkand and the Upper [[Zeravshan]] were annexed by Russia and the country was opened to Russian merchants. The [[emir]] retained his throne as a vassal of Russia and made up his territorial losses by establishing, with Russian help, control over [[Shahr-e Sabz]], and the mountainous regions in the upper Zeravshan Valley in 1870 and by annexing the principalities of the western Pamir in 1895.  At the end of August 1920 the last emir, Sayyid Alim Khan, was overthrown as a result of the invasion of the emirate by Soviet troops, and on 6 October the emirate was abolished and the [[Bukharan People's Soviet Republic]] proclaimed.

===Soviet Rule (1920&ndash;1991)===
The national-administrative divisions placed the ancient Tajik cities, Bukhara and Samarkand, outside the Tajikistan SSR when the borders were drawn in 1928. As citizens of the [[Uzbek SSR]] many Tajiks came under pressure to conform to their newly-ascribed 'Uzbek' identity, and under threat of exile or worse for nonconformity, many were forced to change their identity. Tajik schools were closed and Tajiks were not appointed to leadership positions simply because of their ethnicity.

With the establishment of Soviet rule, Jewish life seriously deteriorated and thousands of Jews left the region because of religious oppression, confiscation of property, arrests, and repressions.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

===Tajikistan (1991-Present day)===
In the last years of the Soviet Union (1986-1990) the Tajikisan SSR went through numerous positive changes due to mass protests and the initiative of a few notable members of the Majlisi Oli (Verkhovniy Soviet) or Parliament, which led the movement towards independence. During this time the [[Tajik language]] gained the status of an official language of the Tajikistan SSR, next to Russian. Ethnic Russians started losing their grip on power and more Tajiks become politically active. Prominent independence movement leaders, also known as Opposition, emerged.  Opposition led the mass protests in the capital city of Dushanbe and in August of 1991 forced president K. Makhkamov to resign.

The [[Civil War of Tajikistan|civil war in Tajikistan]] (1992-1997) was caused by several factors, including:
# Tajikistan's lack of educational and economic base
# Soviet Distribution of land during 1920's
# The restriction of regional and religious self-expression during the Soviet period.
# External influences, especially from Afghanistan, Uzbekistan{{Fact|date=June 2007}} and Russia{{Fact|date=June 2007}}.

Having been run by Leninabadis ([[Khujand]]) throughout the Soviet period,{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Tajikistan is now almost entirely controlled by [[Kulyab]]is, from the home region of President Rakhmonov.

Numerous notable individual were murdered during the war and throughout the 1990s. This list includes journalist and politician [[Otakhon Latifi]], journalist and Jewish leader [[Meirkhaim Gavrielov]], and politician [[Safarali Kenjayev]].

Since 1991 much of the country's non-Muslim population, including Russians and Jews, has emigrated due to severe poverty and instability. In 1992 most of the country<U+2019>s Jewish population was evacuated to Israel.

Nevertheless, a number of opposition political parties have been legalized and are participating in elections, suggesting that the country may be stabilizing politically. [[Russia]]n-led peacekeeping troops are based throughout the country{{Fact|date=June 2007}} (apart from their officers, most of these troops are, in fact, Tajiks), and Russian-commanded border guards were stationed along the border with [[Afghanistan]] till 2006.<ref>[http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=407&issue_id=3306&article_id=2369631 RUSSIAN BORDER GUARDS BEGIN WITHDRAWAL FROM TAJIKISTAN, EURASIA DAILY MONITOR], Volume 2, Issue 78 (April 21, 2005)</ref>
