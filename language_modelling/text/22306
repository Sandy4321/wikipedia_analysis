"'''City of Blinding Lights'''" is a song by the [[rock music|rock]] band [[U2]]. It is the fifth track on their 2004 album ''[[How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb]]'', and it was released as the album's third single on 6 June 2005. The song was partially inspired by [[New York City]] in the aftermath of the [[September 11, 2001]] attacks, and the band's experience in playing there. The underlying theme of the lyrics reflects lost innocence. "City of Blinding Lights" was commonly played as the opening song during shows on the [[Vertigo Tour]], and it has since become a live staple of U2 concerts. 

The song was well received by critics following ''How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb''{{'}}s release and it won a [[Grammy Award]] for "[[Best Rock Song]]" in [[48th Grammy Awards|2006]]. The song has been used in episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Entourage (TV series)|Entourage]]'', the film ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'', and as a theme song for several of [[Barack Obama]]'s campaign events during the [[2008 US presidential election]]. 

==Writing and recording==
"City of Blinding Lights" was developed from an [[outtake]] called "Scott Walker" from the band's 1997 album, ''[[Pop (album)|Pop]]'', which was written as an homage to the [[Scott Walker (singer)|singer of the same name]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Adrian |last=Deevoy |date=November 2004 |title=It Could be about God... |journal=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]}}</ref> By the time of ''Pop''{{'}}s release the song was only a skeletal outline, and the band reworked it during the recording sessions for their 2000 album ''[[All That You Can't Leave Behind]]''. The song was still not completed when that album was released, but the band continued to work on it for ''How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb''.<ref>Stokes (2005), page 172.</ref> Bassist [[Adam Clayton]] noted that "There was a melody and a groove that ultimately didn't go anywhere and we kind of threw out everything, found chords that worked with that melody and built it back up, new drum parts, new bass parts, new guitars."<ref name="u2byu2">McCormick (2006), page 324.</ref>

The chorus was developed from U2's experience of playing a concert in [[New York City]] on the [[Elevation Tour]] following the terrorist attacks of [[September 11, 2001]]. It was the first time the band had played in the city since the attacks occurred and, when the lights illuminated the audience in [[Madison Square Garden]] during the band's performance of "[[Where the Streets Have No Name]]", the band were able to see tears streaming down the faces of many fans.<ref name="stokes">Stokes (2005), page 173.</ref> At that moment lead singer [[Bono]] shouted out "Oh you look so beautiful tonight"; this line later became the song's chorus.<ref name="U2.com blurb">{{cite web |title=City of Blinding Lights |url=http://www.u2.com/discography/index/album/albumId/4074/tagName |publisher=U2.com |accessdate=2009-11-21 |archivedate=2009-11-21 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lSgjwIr6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/new/53122/how-to-dismantle-atomic-bomb.html |title=How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lSgnNqU7 |archivedate=2009-11-21 |work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] |first=Ann |last=Powers |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref> The passion of the fans and the state of the city after the attack were a leading inspiration for many of the song's other lyrics.<ref name="u2byu2" />

The first verse is set in [[London]] and the chorus in New York City.<ref name="u2byu2" /> The verse "I've seen you walk unafraid / I've seen you in the clothes you've made / Can you see the beauty inside of me? / What happened to the beauty I had inside of me?" was written as an expression of love for Bono's wife, [[Ali Hewson]], with a reflection on their life together as they grow older.<ref name="stokes" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described the song as "building into a bittersweet lament."<ref name="RS review">{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/6629835/review/6630492/howtodismantleanatomicbomb |title=U2: How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2004-12-09 |first=Rob |last=Sheffield |accessdate=2009-11-21 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lSgs5G55 |archivedate=2009-11-21}}</ref> The sound of "City of Blinding Lights" has been compared to the band's 1987 single "Where the Streets Have No Name", due to a similar style of guitar playing, as well as to the tone of the band's 1984 album ''[[The Unforgettable Fire]]''.<ref name="Popmatters">{{cite web |title=U2: How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb |url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/u/u2-howtodismantle.shtml |publisher=PopMatters |first=Justin |last=Cober-Lake |date=2004-11-23 |accessdate=2009-11-21 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lSgw3i5b |archivedate=2009-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=10062 |work=[[Music Week]] |title=Special report: U2 album playback, London |date=2004-10-13 |accessdate=2009-11-21 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lSgz67LZ |archivedate=2009-11-21}}</ref> ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' said it was "beautiful but slightly sinister", noting that many of the lyrics have "a similarly Zen quality to [[George Harrison]]'s '[[The Inner Light (song)|The Inner Light]]'."<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] |title=The Big Bang |date=October 2004}}</ref>

The underlying theme of "City of Blinding Lights" is that of lost innocence; the song was inspired by an exhibition of [[Anton Corbijn]]'s photographs in The Netherlands. [[Bono]] saw a photograph of himself in a helicopter as they prepared to film the video for "[[New Year's Day (song)|New Year's Day]]" and was asked by a journalist what he would say to his younger self if given a chance. Bono replied, "I'd tell him he's absolutely right and stop second guessing himself", later extrapolating that "I realized how much I'd lost... that way of looking at the world. There was such a clarity to it, but it was so defiant in a way."<ref name="u2byu2" /> This view was reinforced during an impromptu promo concert underneath the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] when Bono introduced the song by reminiscing about the first time the band arrived in New York City, saying "This is a song about innocence and na<U+00EF>vete."<ref>{{cite video |people=U2 |title=City of Blinding Lights |medium=DVD single |publisher=[[Island Records]] |location=New York City |date=2005}}</ref>
