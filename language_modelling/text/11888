'''Gary Andrew Naysmith''' (born [[November 16]], [[1978]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]) is a [[football (soccer)|football]] [[defender (football)|defender]], currently playing for [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in the [[Football League Championship]].

==Club career==
===Hearts===

Raised in [[Loanhead]], Naysmith started his senior career with [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]], whom he joined from local side [[Whitehill Welfare F.C.|Whitehill]]'s Colts team. He made his professional debut, aged only 17, several months later in a [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] tie with [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. His opportunity arose from a suspension crisis, the ''Maroons'' having no less than four defenders ([[Pasquale Bruno|Bruno]], [[David Weir (Scottish footballer)|Weir]], [[Paul Ritchie (footballer born 1975)|Ritchie]] and [[Neil Pointon|Pointon]]) sent off in their previous match at [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. Despite the patchwork nature of their defense, Hearts defeated Celtic 1-0, with Naysmith earning plaudits for his mature display. Within a year he had established himself as the side's first-choice left back, displacing Neil Pointon, and in 1998 helped the Tynecastle club end their 36-year trophy-jinx by lifting the [[Scottish Cup]]. That season he was also named [[Scottish PFA Young Player of the Year]].

A transitional season followed as the loss of Weir, [[Neil McCann|McCann]] (both transferred) and [[Colin Cameron|Cameron]] (injured) destabilised the side. Naysmith himself had to adapt to a change in the levels of expectation placed upon him, no longer allowed the defence of youthful na<U+00EF>vet<U+00E9>. By [[1999-00 in Scottish football|1999-2000]] though he had rediscovered his confidence and was being touted for an international call-up. A particular highlight of that season was his display in a surprise 3-2 defeat of Celtic at [[Celtic Park|Parkhead]] in February 2000. Hearts had trailed 2-0 before battling back to victory, with Naysmith striking a spectacular equalising goal.<ref name="Celtic">{{cite web|url=http://www.heartsfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/BigMomentsDetail/0,,10289~725930,00.html|

As one of Hearts most valuable assets, Naysmith was also the subject of transfer speculation. Financial concerns at the club heightened these and in October 2000 it appeared that Naysmith was bound for the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] when [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] bid for him. However, their offer was bettered by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] at the eleventh hour, and Naysmith moved to Merseyside instead, in a <U+00A3>1.7 million deal.

===Everton===

Naysmith first became a regular under [[Walter Smith]] and then under his successor [[David Moyes]]. His mesmerising early performances cemented his place in Evertonians' hearts, who gave him the nickname "El Blanco Carlos", after the Brazilian left-back [[Roberto Carlos]]. He made 152 appearances for Everton, scoring six goals, although his ''Toffees'' career was disrupted by injury. In December 2002 he was the victim of a "blood curdling" tackle by Liverpool's [[Steven Gerrard]].<ref name="Gerrard">{{cite web|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,4572658-6,00.html|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|title=Gerrard says sorry after horror tackle on Naysmith|date=[[23 December]] [[2002]]}}</ref> A long term ankle injury in 2005 meant that Naysmith lost his first-team place at Everton to [[Alessandro Pistone]] in the  [[2004-05 in English football|2004-2005 season]], and in the [[2005-06 in English football|2005-2006 season]] [[Portugal|Portuguese]] international [[Nuno Valente]] cemented himself as first choice left-back at Goodison Park. 

Naysmith recovered from ankle surgery in time for the start of the [[2006-07 in English football|2006-07 season]] and an injury to Valente in the season's opening game saw him restored to the starting eleven. He kept his place after Valente returned to fitness, however it wasn't long before injury befell him again, a [[Medial collateral ligament|medial ligament]] strain in the game against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on September 24, 2006 keeping him out for two months.

Throughout his time at Everton, Naysmith was linked to transfers away from the club, his skilled play frequently catching the eye of opposition scouts. At the end of the 2004-2005 season, it was rumoured that he would be leaving on a free transfer, before signing a new 3-year contract with the ''Blues''.<ref name="Deal">{{cite web|url=http://www.noticias.info/Archivo/2005/200506/20050614/20050614_74321.shtm|publisher=[[Everton F.C.|Everton website]]|title=Naysmith signs in|date=[[14 June]] [[2005]]}}</ref> Naysmith was widely rumoured to be a target for Scottish champions Celtic and German club [[VfB Stuttgart]] in the summer of 2006.<ref name="Stuttgart">{{cite web|url=http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=394963&plid=2269&clid=169&cpid=22|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|title=Stuttgart target Naysmith|date=[[14 June]] [[2006]]}}</ref> However, David Moyes denied any interest from Celtic <ref name="Moyes">{{cite web|url=http://evertonfc.com/news/archive/no-celtic-interest.html|publisher=[[Everton F.C.|Everton website]]|title=No Celtic interest}}</ref> and the August 31<sup>st</sup> transfer deadline passed with no transfer for Naysmith.

On 5th May 2007 Naysmith scored the third goal in a 3-0 victory over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] The win practically guaranteed that Everton would be playing in the Europe during the 07/08 season due to Everton's considerably superior goal difference over [[Reading F.C.|Reading]].

===Sheffield United===

As part of the deal that brought [[Phil Jagielka]] to Goodison Park on July 4 2007, Naysmith was given permission to speak to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] to discuss a possible move. He was signed by [[Sheffield United F.C.|the Blades]] on July 5 for [[pounds sterling|<U+00A3>]]1 [[million]]. 

Naysmith, agreed terms with [[Sheffield United F.C.|the Blades]] and signed a three-year deal at [[Bramall Lane]] ending a six-and-half-year stay with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].<ref>[http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0,16368,1804_2472019,00.html Naysmith seals <U+00A3>1m Blades switch.], TEAMtalk.com, [[5 July]][[2007]].</ref>  He made his full first team debut in the opening game of the 2007-08 season in a 2-2 home draw with [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]]<ref name="BBC1">{{Cite web

==International career==
Naysmith made his full [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] debut in  May 2000, in a 2-1 victory over the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] in [[Dublin]].<ref name="Scotland">{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/player_details.cfm?playerid=43306&squadid=1|
publisher=[[Scottish Football Association|Scottish FA]]|title=Naysmith's Player Details}}</ref> He quickly established himself in the squad, becoming an automatic choice, when fit, for the left back berth and as a result had won 32 caps by January 2007. His only international goal came in 2002, during a [[UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2004]] qualifying game with [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]]. Fielded in an unfamiliar central midfield role  by [[Berti Vogts]], Naysmith scored Scotland's second goal in a 2-0 win, with a right-footed volley from the edge of the box.
