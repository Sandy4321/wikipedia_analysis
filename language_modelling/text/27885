'''''The Simpsons'' Ride''' is a [[simulator ride]] featured at the [[Universal Studios Florida]] and [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] theme parks.  The ride is based on the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It was first announced in 2007 and replaced the [[Back to the Future: The Ride]] at both locations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://travel.latimes.com/daily-deal-blog/?p=1656 |title=Universal Studios Simpsons ride shows visitors Krustyland|accessdate=2008-04-27|date=2008-04-08|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|author=Brady MacDonald}}</ref> The ride at Universal Studios Florida soft opened on April 23, 2008, and the official ceremonies took place on May 15. The ride at Universal Studios Hollywood opened on May 19, 2008. The Simpsons Ride was collaborated on by the producers of ''The Simpsons'', and uses [[Computer-generated imagery|computer generated]] [[3-D film|3D]] animation, which was provided by Blur Studio and [[Reel FX Creative Studios|Reel FX]].  2D animation was provided by [[Film Roman]].  The ride uses state of the art technology, including a new projection system and new hydraulics.

The ride itself is four and a half minutes long but original footage for the ride can be seen in the queue, and there is also a pre-show video. In the ride, patrons are introduced to a cartoon theme park called Krustyland built by [[Krusty the Clown]]. [[Sideshow Bob]], however, is loose from prison to get revenge on Krusty and the [[Simpson family]]. At least 24 regular characters from the series make an appearance, all voiced by their original actors. Along with the attraction is a gift shop modeled after the [[Kwik-E-Mart]], which opened in late 2007.

==Ride summary==
===Queue===
To enter the ride's queue area, visitors must walk through a {{convert|32|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Krusty the Clown]] head<ref name="Woo Hoo! Itchy For Fun" /> which leads them into a pavilion under various circus tents themed to carnival stalls. Various posters in the queue display advertisements for the attractions at the park, while various [[High-definition television|HD]] television monitors display clips from the TV show billed as moments from Krusty's past, as well as live animated footage from Krustyland. The queue area ends with a sign instructing guests to wait for a short time before entering "Krusty's Carnival Midway".

===Pre-show===
[[File:The Simpsons Ride Universal Studios Florida.jpg|left|thumb|The Florida installation's entrance.]]

In the [[Midway (fair)|midway]], riders line-up into rows to wait for a confirmation from Krusty. TV screens posted inside the walls on the left and right sides of the room display the residents of Springfield running the midway booths at the park. Soon, Krusty appears on another screen in front of guests and prepares to pick the first family to ride his "Thrilltacular: Upsy-Downsy Spins-Aroundsy Teen-Operated Thrillride", the most extreme ride at the park. While Krusty is not looking, [[Sideshow Bob]] appears in a Scratchy costume and steps on [[Homer Simpson]]'s foot causing him to yell "[[D'oh!]]" and Krusty picks the [[Simpson family]]. Krusty asks them to pick another group to go with them, and Bart chooses the riders. While Krusty leads them into a waiting room, Sideshow Bob bursts out into evil laughter. Riders are then ushered into the pre-flight "Funhouse" room by a team member. Here, Krusty leads the Simpsons into a backstage area where [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]] and [[Maggie Simpson]] are told not to ride due to certain safety restrictions. Grampa falls asleep while Maggie crawls into a nuclear reactor room, causing her to grow larger. Meanwhile, Krusty leads the Simpsons into a ride room where he tells them to enjoy the ride, before Sideshow Bob appears, knocks Krusty out and tells the Simpsons Family to enter the ride vehicle. Homer enters, followed by the rest of the family. Sideshow Bob then tells the Simpsons and the riders that they must watch a safety speil from [[The Itchy & Scratchy Show|Itchy and Scratchy]]. The screen then displays a recap of the safety reminders while riders are ushered into the main ride room.

===Ride===
[[File:Simpsons Ride Film.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sideshow Bob]] prepares to kill the [[Simpson family]] in a scene from the ride film.]]
The ride portion is four and a half minutes long. Riders with heart conditions, [[motion sickness]], [[claustrophobia]] or similar conditions are not recommended to ride.

After riders enter a Krusty themed ride car vehicle, the Squeaky-Voiced Teen appears on a TV screen in the ride cabin and tells the guests that they're with him. He then says to keep the screaming down so he can study for a math test, because if he doesn't get a C or higher, he'll get kicked out of the audio-visual club. As if the studying and groaning would take forever, Sideshow Bob cuts off the teenager's signal and takes control of the screen, telling them that he has taken over Krustyland and pulls a lever from thrilling to killing which activates the vehicles and lifts out of the room, starting the ride with the Simpsons in front of them. The coaster begins going down various drops before Homer gets hit by the wrecking ball controlled by Sideshow Bob before it smashes into the track, breaking it. Homer and the riders fly into a different part of the roller coaster track before the wrecking ball starts chasing them. Soon, the riders fly off the coaster and into the "Happy Little Elves in Panda Land" attraction with Bart and Lisa, where Bob takes control of an evil panda and sends the vehicles crashing through the attraction. The ride then flies off the attraction and enters "Captain Dinosaur's Pirate Rip-Off" with Homer and Marge. Sideshow Bob appears in a projection on the waterfall in the attraction and tells Homer  to resist temptations inside. Homer grabs a barrel of beer in the ride which soon triggers a trap that causes them to exit out of the attraction and arrive at "Krusty's Wet and Smoky Stunt Show" where they are taken racing in circles while tied to a killer whale before Bob corners them at the attractions exit. Maggie, still giant-sized, appears and grabs and bangs him into the vehicle, which almost falls into Hell before it is saved by [[Professor Frink]]. Bob then steals Maggie's pacifier and tells her that she must destroy [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] to get it back. Riders then take a ride through Springfield before encountering Maggie again, who mistakes their car for a new pacifier, and sucks on them repeatedly, before spitting them out, catapulting them into the [[742 Evergreen Terrace|Simpsons' house]]. The family is sitting on their couch when [[Kang and Kodos]] turns the house into Krusty's "Death Drop" ride. The riders are then dropped down from the sky, encountering various Simpsons characters along the way (The on-ride photo is taken here for the Orlando attraction). They land back at the entrance to Krustyland, where Bob prepares to kill them, before the couch the Simpsons are sitting on drops onto him. Maggie then appears and pushes down the Krusty head over the Simpsons. The vehicle is then calmly lowered back down to the ground while mist, fire, electricity and smoke effects spray, and Krusty appears on the TV screen in the loading room. For the Orlando attraction, Krusty is sitting in a control room and pushes an emergency button on the camera, causing the vehicle to vibrate, ending the ride. In the Hollywood version, Krusty is sitting in a control room and takes a picture of the guests (The on-ride photo is taken here for the Hollywood attraction). After the [[gullwing doors]] on the car lift up, guests exit the ride.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/travel/features/2008/03/15/universal-studios-reveals-its-new-simpsons-ride-89520-20351783/|title=Universal Studios reveals its new Simpsons Ride|publisher=Mirror.Co.UK|accessdate=2008-08-11|date=2008-03-15}}</ref>

===History===
[[Image:Simpsonsride2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Construction on the attraction at the Florida location.]]
Planning for The Simpsons Ride started two years prior to its opening. ''The Simpsons'' creators [[James L. Brooks]] and [[Matt Groening]], as well as executive producer [[Al Jean]], collaborated with the Universal Studios creative team, [[Universal Creative]], to help develop the ride.<ref name="SanDiego">{{cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20080515-9999-1w15ride.html|title=Homer and Marge's eeeexcelllent adventure |date=2008-05-15|accessdate=2008-05-15|author=Penny Lingo|publisher=''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]''}}</ref>  Music for the ride was composed by [[James Dooley (composer)|Jim Dooley]], who worked with composer [[Hans Zimmer]] on the feature film ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.<ref name="factsheet">{{cite news|url=http://database.thrillnetwork.com/ride_view.php/8118/the_simpsons_ride.html|title=The Simpsons Ride Fact Sheet|date=2008-05-14|accessdate=2008-05-14|publisher=ThrillNetwork.com}}</ref> The ride is located at both Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood in the former [[Back to the Future: The Ride]] buildings at both locations. The ''Back to the Future'' opened in Florida in 1991 and closed March 30, 2007, while the Hollywood version opened in 1993 and closed on September 3, 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/03/america/NA-GEN-US-Theme-Park-Ride.php |title=Universal Studios' 'Back to the Future' ride heads into the past, to be replaced by 'Simpsons' |date=2007-09-03| accessdate=2008-05-19|publisher=''[[International Herald Tribune]]''|author=Associated Press}}</ref>

The Simpsons Ride uses new technology that cuts down on its energy consumption. According to Universal Studios, the ride is able to save over 55,000 [[watt]]s on average and 662,000 watt-hours per day. The ride includes over 2,500 [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] lights, the largest number in theme park history, which allows the ride to cut down on energy on lighting by almost one quarter when compared with incandescent lighting.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.etravelblackboard.com/index.asp?id=76992&nav=83 |title=Universal Studios goes Green with the new "The Simpsons Ride"|date=2008-04-29|accessdate=2008-04-29|publisher=Travel Blackboard}}</ref>

Jay Cridlin of the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' wrote that "the ride is packed with more original, funny material than you'd expect to see in a sitcom, much less a theme park." However, he admitted that the ride was "a little discombobulating".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/travel/attractions/article515629.ece |title=Universal Orlando fuels Simpsons Ride with manic imagination  | accessdate=2008-05-20|date=2008-05-20|publisher=''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''|author=Jay Cridlin}}</ref>
