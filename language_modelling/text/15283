'''Aeneas Demetrius Williams''' ({{pronEng|un-NEE-us}}) (born [[January 29]], [[1968]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]) is a former [[American football]] [[cornerback]] and [[free safety]], who last played with the [[St. Louis Rams]]. Williams, whose father worked for [[Union Carbide]], attended Fortier High School, where he played football on a team with three future [[National Football League|NFL]] players. Although he was admitted to [[Dartmouth College]], Williams chose to attend [[Southern University]], the same school his brother Achilles attended. At Southern University, Williams concentrated on his academics, not playing football until his senior year, as a graduate student. That year, he tied the [[NCAA Division I-AA]] record for most interceptions. 

Williams joined the [[Arizona Cardinals]] in [[1991]], and quickly established himself as a shutdown corner, with an exceptional rookie season, tying the NFL lead for interceptions. As of [[1997]], Williams had four [[Pro Bowl]] appearances and routinely covered the opposing team's lead receivers.  In the 1998 season, Williams helped the Cardinals win their first playoff game since 1947 by intercepting two passes from [[Troy Aikman]] in a 20-7 win over the [[Dallas Cowboys]], and added another inteception in the Cardinals 41-21 loss in the divisional round.  Despite playing mostly for bad teams (the Cardinals had a winning record only once in his 10 years there), Williams was recognized as one of the best cornerbacks in the league.  In 2000, he tied an NFL record by returning a fumble 104 yards for a touchdown in a game against the [[Washington Redskins]].

In [[2001]] he was traded to the [[St. Louis Rams]] on draft day in exchange for picks in the second and fourth rounds [http://archive.profootballweekly.com/content/archives/features_2000/spin_042301.asp]. Due to roster concerns, Williams learned the free safety position.  With the Rams, He went to [[Super Bowl XXXVI]], in which his team lost to the New England Patriots.  In the Rams divisional playoff game against the [[Green Bay Packers]] prior to the Super Bowl, Williams returned two interceptions from Packers quarterback [[Brett Favre]] for touchdowns and recovered a fumble.  Then in the NFC title game, he intercepted a pass from [[Philadelphia Eagles]] quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] with 2 minutes left in regulation, clinching the game and ensuring his team a trip to the Super Bowl.

Williams, after a lackluster season which he ended on the [[injured reserve]] list, quietly retired during the [[2005]] offseason. Over his career he accumulated a staggering 12 defensive touchdowns (9 interceptions returned for a touchdown, and 3 fumbles recovered for touchdowns), and 55 career interceptions, cementing his place as one of the most dominating defensive backs of his era.  He also recovered 23 fumbles and gained 1,075 total defensive return yards (807 from interceptions and 268 from fumbles). He was also a 4 time All-Pro selection.

Williams is notable for being the player who delivered the tackle which ultimately ended Hall of Fame [[San Francisco 49ers]]' quarterback [[Steve Young (athlete)|Steve Young]]'s career. Williams came in on a cornerback blitz from Young's blindside.  [[Running back]] [[Lawrence Phillips]] was supposed to block Williams, but missed, enabling Williams to score a clean hit on Young.  This occurred on national television, a [[Monday Night Football]] game, and left Young unconscious the field for quite a few minutes. The hit subsequently ended Young's tenure in the NFL as it resulted in a severe concussion, which was just one of many in the quarterback's career.

He will be inducted into the Arizona Cardinals' Ring of Honor during the 2008-2009 football season during halftime of the Monday Night Football game against the San Francisco 49ers on Monday November 10, 2008.<ref>[http://www.azcentral.com/sports/cardinals/articles/2008/05/07/20080507cardsnews.html AZCentral.com "Williams to Ring, McKinnon to Hall"]</ref>
