'''Blixa Bargeld''' (born '''Hans Christian Emmerich''' on 12 January 1959) is a composer, author, actor, singer, musician, performer and lecturer in a number of artistic fields. He is best known for his studio work and tours with the groups [[Einst<U+00FC>rzende Neubauten]] and [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]].

== Artistic career ==
In 1980, he founded the music group Einst<U+00FC>rzende Neubauten, which has released numerous albums and singles, performed all over the world, and still exists to this day. His stage name comes from ''Blixa'', a [[Germany|German]] brand of blue felt pen, and ''Bargeld'', [[German language|German]] for ''[[cash]]''. ''Bargeld'' also refers to German [[Dada]] artist [[Johannes Theodor Baargeld]].

From 1983 to 2003, Blixa Bargeld was a long-time guitarist and backing vocalist in Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Bargeld also sang several "co-lead" vocals with [[Nick Cave|Cave]], such as on "The Carny" and "The Weeping Song." Nick Cave first saw Bargeld performing with Einst<U+00FC>rzende Neubauten on TV while [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]] (Cave's band at the time) were touring in Amsterdam. He described the music as "mournful", Bargeld as looking "destroyed", and his screams as "a sound you would expect to hear from strangled cats or dying children."<ref>EN: 20 ans de Nostalgie</ref>

He is credited with playing guitar on the [[Gun Club]] song, "Yellow Eyes", on their 1987 album ''Mother Juno''.<ref>''Mother Juno'' album sleeve.</ref> He also played on the album ''[[Novice (album)|Novice]]'' by [[Alain Bashung]] in 1989.

Since the middle of the 90s Bargeld has appeared live with his solo ''Rede/Speech Performances''. During these performances, usually supported by [[Einst<U+00FC>rzende Neubauten|Neubauten's]] sound engineer [[Boris Wilsdorf]], he works with microphones, sound effects, overdubbing with the help of sampler loops, and speaks English or [[German language|German]]. The performed pieces include such curiosities as a vocal creation of the [[DNA]] of an [[angel]] and a parody of a techno song.

In 2007 he started a collaborative project with [[Alva Noto]] called [[ANBB]], an abbreviation of Noto's and Bargeld's initials. An EP, [[Ret Marut Handshake]] was released on June 26, 2010, followed later that year by a full-length album, "Mimikry".

Dr Jennifer Shryane in her book ''Blixa Bargeld and Einst<U+00FC>rzende Neubauten: German Experimental Music. Evading do-re-mi''. (Ashgate, 2011) explores how the themes and threads of Bargeld<U+2019>s work with Neubauten find even greater variation and experimentation in his performance work outside of the band. For example, the range extends from his surreal, electronic Dadaist-cabaret Rede and collaborations with Alva Noto, to his expert direction of Coetzee<U+2019>s Warten auf die Barbaren  for the Salzburg Festival in 2005 where he employed multi-layered symbolism through an ice-white setting and an interplay of voices, screams and noise.

Jennifer Shryane<U+2019>s book particularly examines his vocal strategies and his trademark scream (describing the scream in dance terms as the endless pirouette or unanticipated giant leap) and the labyrinthine concerns of his texts <U+2013> all through Artaudian performance theory (The Theatre and its Double, 1938). She also stresses Bargeld<U+2019>s passionate stance on the socializing aspects of music (a la John Cage) citing his comment on Grundst<U+00FC>ck that <U+2018>it<U+2019>s the social aspects which are important for me<U+2019>.

==Personal life==
Blixa is a school dropout and he left his parents' home in the late 1970s. A 2008 documentary featured him visiting his mother and talking to her about his childhood and the relationship he had with his parents.<ref name="2008docu">"Mein Leben <U+2013> Blixa Bargeld" (Documentary Film directed by Birgit Herdlitschke, [[ZDF]] / [[ARTE]], Germany  2008)</ref>

He had a short romance with [[Cinema of Transgression]]'s [[Lung Leg]], documented in [[Nick Zedd]]'s ''[[Totem of the Depraved]]''.{{fact|date=January 2012}}

Blixa Bargeld is married to Erin Zhu, webmaster of http://neubauten.org. Together they developed the
concept of web-based fan subscriptions as a new and innovative business model for the music industry. The couple is featured in the 2010 book Designing Media <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designing-media.com/interviews/BlixaBargeldErinZhu |title=Designing Media Interview of Blixa Bargeld and Erin Zhu |publisher=designing-media.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-16}}</ref> by design legend and IDEO co-founder [[Bill Moggridge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ideo.com/ |title=Ideo |publisher=designing-media.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-16}}</ref> Blixa and Erin are among 37 design and media luminaries highlighted in the book.

The couple resides in San Francisco, Beijing and Berlin with their daughter.<ref name="2008docu"/><ref name="spiegel2009">[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/musik/0,1518,602439,00.html Ich war ja nie der Punk, der vorm Postamt rumsteht], 2009 interview, [[Stern (magazine)|stern.de]] (German)</ref>

Blixa was a [[vegetarian]] for 30 years, breaking with this lifestyle due to the difficulties of eating vegetarian in China, where he lived with his wife.<ref name="spiegel2009"/>

He was also a smoker for a long time, but quit smoking in early 2000s{{When|date=December 2010}}. A sound of Blixa smoking a cigarette is a part of Einst<U+00FC>rzende Neubauten's song "''Silence Is Sexy''" (2000), which could be heard both on [[Silence Is Sexy|studio album]] and live performances of 2000 world tour. During the Neubauten's 25th Anniversary Tour in 2010, Blixa smoked herbal cigarettes for the performances of this song.{{fact|date=January 2012}}

==Instruments==
His current guitars of choice are a [[Fender Jaguar]] and a [[Fender Mustang]], as seen on the concert DVD ''God Is In The House'', the partner documentary ''[[No More Shall We Part]]'', and various other media appearances.  Initially he used a highly battered Hofner Model 173 and a red Hofner Colorama II until they "broke down."  After his effect pedals were stolen in the early eighties, he has exclusively relied on the Fender floating/dynamic tremolo  (like the Hofner units) which both raise and lower the pitch, Fender Twin amplifiers, metal slides, and changing his amp settings for each individual song to create his unique guitar sound.<ref>http://www.bendecho.de/deb9a62ce9-einstuerzende-neubauten-interview-2</ref> He also makes extensive use of the [[Lexicon JamMan]] for vocal loops.
