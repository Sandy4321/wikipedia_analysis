'''Inspector G. Lestrade''' or '''Mr. Lestrade''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Scotland Yard]] detective appearing in several of the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. Doyle used the name of a friend from his days at the [[University of Edinburgh]], a [[Saint Lucian]] medical student by the name of Joseph Alexandre Lestrade.  In "[[The Adventure of the Cardboard Box]]", Lestrade's first initial is revealed to be [[G]].  Lestrade is described as "a lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking," in ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'' and "a little sallow rat-faced, dark-eyed fellow" in "[[The Boscombe Valley Mystery]]".  He was summarised by H. Paul Jeffers in the following words:<blockquote>
"He is the most famous detective ever to walk the corridors of Scotland Yard, yet he existed only in the fertile imagination of a writer.  He was Inspector Lestrade.  We do not know his first name, only his initial: G.  Although he appears thirteen times in the immortal adventures of Sherlock Holmes, nothing is known of the life outside the Yard of the detective whom Dr. Watson described unflatteringly as sallow, rat-faced, and dark-eyed and whom Holmes saw as quick and energetic but wholly conventional, lacking in imagination, and normally out of his depth<U+2014>the best of a bad lot who had reached the top in the CID by bulldog tenacity."<ref>P. 95. Jeffers, H. Paul.  "Bloody Business:  An Anecdotal History of Scotland Yard (C)1992 edition printed by arrangement with Barnes and Noble.</ref>
</blockquote>
In BBC's 'Sherlock' Holmes describes Lestrade as 'one of his only three friends in the world.' The others being John and Mrs Hudson.

==History==
In the popular London media, Lestrade is depicted as one of the best detectives at Scotland Yard, chiefly because Holmes regularly allows him to take the credit for his deductions in cases such as "[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]" and "[[The Adventure of the Norwood Builder]]". In truth, he was already well-established as a respected policeman with 20 years in the Force before ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]''.  It is observed by Holmes that Lestrade and another detective, [[Tobias Gregson]], have an ongoing rivalry, and he identifies the two as "the best of a bad lot ... both quick and energetic, but conventional&nbsp;<U+2014> shockingly so." Holmes once remarked in "[[The Adventure of the Cardboard Box]]" that, although Lestrade had almost no skill at actual crime-solving, his tenacity and determination are what brought him to the highest ranks in the official police force. His conventional nature leads him to grow frustrated at Holmes' methods, becoming "indifferent and contemptuous" to his exploration in "[[The Boscombe Valley Mystery]]". In both "The Boscombe Valley Mystery" and "[[The Adventure of the Norwood Builder]]", he states that he is "a practical man" in dismissal of Holmes' apparently trifling actions.  Nevertheless, Lestrade's appreciation of Holmes' methods grows&nbsp;<U+2014> likely aided by being credited with Holmes' successes&nbsp;<U+2014> and by the time of ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' Watson observes "from the reverential way in which Lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since the days when they had first worked together."

Additionally, despite a disregard for Lestrade's single-mindedness, Holmes appears to have an affection for the detective. In ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'', Holmes comments to [[Dr. Watson]] that Lestrade "is the best of the professionals, I think," meaning the professional detectives employed by Scotland Yard as opposed to himself, and it is Lestrade more than any other official that Holmes works with. In "[[The Adventure of the Six Napoleons]]" it is revealed that Lestrade regularly drops in on Holmes and Watson at [[221B Baker Street]], sharing the news of [[Scotland Yard]] and discussing his current cases with Holmes. For his part, Lestrade gradually develops an appreciation of the detective's methods, going so far as to say at the end of the story "We're not jealous of you down at Scotland Yard. No, sir, we are proud of you, and if you come down to-morrow there's not a man, from the oldest inspector to the youngest constable, who wouldn't be glad to shake you by the hand." Watson notes in passing that this little comment is one of the few instances where Holmes is visibly moved.

==Lestrade himself==
Lestrade is somewhat difficult to pin down as a character.  His impatience with Holmes clashes with his kindness to clients, and his level of education appears diffident. Despite being described uncharitably by [[Dr. Watson]], Lestrade is pleasant to him, even implying to Watson in a comic way that he doubts Holmes' sanity in "[[The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor]]". He uses basic working-class language without embellishments and occasionally [[Archaism|archaic]] words such as "shivered" for "smashed" ("[[The Adventure of the Six Napoleons]]") and described his reaction to a nauseating act of murder as "sickish" (''[[A Study in Scarlet]]''). His greatest compliment to Holmes' methods was to describe them as "workmanlike".

Despite a [[French people|French]] [[surname]] (Lestrade is the name of a village in the [[Midi-Pyr<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>es]] and "l'estrade" means "the raised platform"), he fails to respond when Holmes uses French quotations. [[Conan Doyle]] wrote him as a very particular dresser, who nevertheless will get muddy in the line of work. He prefers to get out and find his evidence in person rather than solve them in his head.  In this case he closely resembles another Yarder, [[Athelney Jones]], whom Holmes describes as "tenacious as a lobster" in "[[The Red-Headed League]]".  His appearance and style very much contrast with [[Tobias Gregson]] which visually increases their rivalry.  The two were never paired together after ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]''.

==Depiction in derivatives and adaptations==

The author [[M. J. Trow]] wrote a series of sixteen books using Lestrade as the central character, beginning with ''The Adventures of Inspector Lestrade'' in 1985. In these stories, Trow shows Lestrade to be a more than capable detective. He is given a first name, "'''Sholto'''", a young daughter whom he seldom sees, and a series of adventures set against a historical backdrop. In one book Lestrade meets [[G. K. Chesterton]] and in another he suffers a broken leg in a fall from the gangplank of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']].

Lestrade's lack of ability is frequently exaggerated in adaptations, which often characterise him as a bumbling idiot. Notably, [[Dennis Hoey]] played Lestrade in most of the Sherlock Holmes films from [[Universal Pictures]] starring [[Basil Rathbone]] as Holmes. This version had the Yard man as a well-meaning fool patronised by the detective, whose help he greatly appreciated, rather in the manner of that series' version of [[Doctor Watson]] ([[Nigel Bruce]]). Lestrade is nonetheless a capable officer, and Holmes never questions his honesty or his willingness to solve a case.  In the book ''Sherlock Holmes:  The Man and His World'' by [[H.R.F. Keating]], Keating notes that despite Holmes' accusations of his lack of observational skills, he knows Holmes craves the outr<U+00E9> and uses this to collect his interest in the case of "[[The Adventure of the Six Napoleons]]".<ref>P. 112, Keating, H. R. F. ''Sherlock Holmes: The Man and  His World''; Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, (c)1979 ISBN 0-684-16269-5 </ref>

===Granada Television series===
[[Colin Jeavons]] played Lestrade throughout the [[Granada Television]] adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes stories, starting with "[[The Adventure of the Norwood Builder]]" in ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (TV series)|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]''. The character was portrayed faithfully as a capable, if slightly vain, career policeman with a prickly but ultimately affectionate relationship with Holmes&nbsp;<U+2013> as evidenced in the dramatisation of the aforementioned "We're proud of you" scene. So familiar did the actor become in the part that when he was unavailable for "[[The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans]]", Lestrade was replaced by another of ACD's Yarders, [[Inspector Bradstreet]].  Lestrade's absence was explained as having gone to the Leamington Baths on vacation, and Holmes fumes that he hopes his wife was with him.  This is an embellishment on canon, as Lestrade was never shown to be married or attached.  In other episodes, Jeavons was given parts originally belonging to other detectives, such as "[[The Adventure of the Creeping Man]]" and extra scenes in "The Master Blackmailer" (their version of "The Adventure of [[Charles Augustus Milverton]]").  Lestrade was even mentioned off-screen in the scripts, emphasising his close relationship with 221B Baker Street.  Jeavons' portrayal is considered the most faithful to the Canon.  In ''Starring Sherlock Holmes'' (page 155), [[David Stuart Davies]] wrote, "Lestrade was played with great panache throughout the Granada series by Colin Jeavons, who humanised and enhanced Doyle's sketchy portrait of the Inspector."

===In other media===
* [[John Colicos]] played both Lestrade and [[Professor Moriarty]] at the same time in 1989 TV role of ''My Dearest Watson''.  Colicos and [[Colin Jeavons]] are so far the only actors to play both the policeman and the villain.
* [[Dennis Hoey]] played Lestrade in several of Universal's Sherlock Holmes films, starring [[Basil Rathbone]].
* [[Archie Duncan (actor)|Archie Duncan]] played Lestrade in the 1954<U+2013>55 [[Sheldon Reynolds (producer)|Sheldon Reynolds]] French-made series ''[[Sherlock Holmes (1954 TV Series)|Sherlock Holmes]]''.
* [[Patrick Newell]] played him in the 1980 [[Sheldon Reynolds (producer)|Sheldon Reynolds]] ''[[Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson]]'' series made in Poland. This had [[Geoffrey Whitehead]] as Holmes and [[Donald Pickering]] as Watson.
* [[Borislav Brondukov]] played him in all five films of the Soviet series ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson|Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson]]'' starring [[Vasily Livanov]].
* [[Frank Finlay]] played him twice, in ''[[A Study in Terror]]'' and ''[[Murder by Decree]]'', both focusing on non-canon stories with Holmes investigating the [[Jack the Ripper]] murders.
* Roger Ashton-Griffths played Lestrade in ''[[Young Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1985); his taking credit for solving the mystery earns him a promotion from Detective to Inspector.
* [[Jeffrey Jones]] played Lestrade in ''[[Without a Clue]]''
* [[Kenaway Baker]] made a brief appearance as Lestrade in ''[[Incident at Victoria Falls (1991 TV film)|Incident at Victoria Falls]]''
* Lestrade was played by [[Peter Madden (actor)|Peter Madden]] opposite [[Peter Cushing]] as [[Sherlock Holmes]] in the 1960s [[BBC]] series.
*[[Ronald Lacey]] played Lestrade in the 1983 film version of ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'', starring [[Ian Richardson]] as Holmes.  (Lacey would later play the Sholto Brothers in the Granada television production of ''[[The Sign of the Four]]'' with Jeremy Brett as Holmes.)
* Donald Gee played Inspector "Giles" Lestrade throughout most of the entire BBC Radio canon opposite [[Clive Merrison]]'s Holmes beginning with the November 1989 broadcast of ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'' and ending with the October 13th 1993 broadcast of "The Second Stain". [[Stephen Thorne]] took over the role beginning with the January 12th 1994 broadcast of "The Cardboard Box" and ending in the March 29th 1995 broadcast of "The Retired Colourman"; he returned to the role in the [[BBC Radio]] series ''[[The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'''s June 15th 2004 broadcast of "The Striking Success of Miss Franny Blossom", the January 2nd 2009 broadcast of "The Eye of Horus" and the January 16th 2009 broadcast of "The Ferrers Documents".
* [[Eddie Marsan]] plays him in [[Guy Ritchie]]'s [[Warner Bros.]] adaptation ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'', alongside [[Robert Downey, Jr.]] and [[Jude Law]] (2009). This incarnation of Lestrade expresses a high level of irritation for Holmes, who in turn regards him with affectionate mockery. Lestrade nevertheless depends on Holmes, calling him to crime scenes and even and allowing a fugitive Holmes to escape police custody. He briefly reprised the role in the 2011 sequel [[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]].
* William Huw portrays Lestrade in the 2010 direct-to-DVD [[The Asylum|Asylum]] film ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2010 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]''. In this film, Lestrade does not seem to recognise Watson ([[Gareth David Lloyd]]), and often takes credit for Holmes's accomplishments. He becomes involved in the chase of a criminal mastermind dubbed "[[Spring-Heeled Jack]]", who uses several mechanical creatures to commit crimes across London.
* In the 2010 BBC TV series ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade is played by [[Rupert Graves]].  The series is set in contemporary London, with Lestrade using Holmes as a consultant on difficult cases.  The two characters seem to have a complex working relationship. Some of Lestrade's officers (for instance, Sgt. Sally Donovan ([[Vinette Robinson]]) and Anderson (a member of the forensics team)) are openly hostile to Holmes and protest against his involvement with cases (Donovan at one point speculating that one day Holmes would start to commit crimes rather than just investigate them). However, Lestrade himself oscillates between respect for Holmes' intellectual abilities and annoyance with the consulting detective's social shortcomings.  Both are not above doing "petty" things to annoy each other (like Lestrade carrying out a fake drugs bust on Sherlock's room to retrieve a piece of evidence), but Lestrade's underlying respect and overall faith in Sherlock is probably best demonstrated in his stated opinion that "Sherlock Holmes is a great man, and some day, if we're very very lucky, he might even be a good one." In ''[[The Hounds of Baskerville]]'' Lestrade is addressed by Watson as Greg, Sherlock thinks it is a pseudonym to spy on him for Mycroft, but Lestrade says Sherlock just never bothered to ask. In ''[[The Reichenbach Fall]]'', when Holmes is framed by Moriarty as a fraud, Lestrade expresses some disbelief in the idea despite the evidence, and is later one of three people- along with John Watson and Mrs Hudson- who are threatened by Moriarty's hired killers unless Holmes kills himself, Moriarty stating that Lestrade, John and Mrs Hudson are the closest thing that Sherlock Holmes has to friends.
