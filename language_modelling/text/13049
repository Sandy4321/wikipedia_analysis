[[Charlotte's Web]], a [[Children's literature|children's book]] by [[E. B. White]], was adapted into an [[animation|animated]] [[musical film]] by [[Hanna Barbera]] Productions and Sagittarius Productions in [[1973 in film|1973]]. The film, distributed to theatres by [[Paramount Pictures]] on [[March 1]], [[1973]], is the first of only three Hanna Barbera features not based upon one of their famous [[television]] [[cartoon]]s &mdash;''[[Heidi's Song]]'' ([[1982 in film|1982]]) and ''[[Once Upon a Forest]]'' ([[1993 in film|1993]]) being the other two&mdash;and was a moderate critical and commercial success. The song score of lyrics and music by the [[Sherman Brothers]], who had previously been responsible for the music in the family films like ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book (1967)]]'' and ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968)]]''. The film has found a devoted following over the years due to television and [[VHS]]; in [[1994]] the film surprised the marketplace by becoming one of the best selling titles of the year, 21 years after its first premiere. No other non-Disney [[musical]] [[animated feature]] has enjoyed such a remarkable comeback in popularity prompting a [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]], ''[[Charlotte's Web 2: Wilbur's Great Adventure]]'', which Paramount released in the US on [[March 18]], [[2003 in film|2003]] (Universal released the film internationally), followed by a [[Charlotte's Web (2006 film)|live-action film version]] of E.B. White's original story, which was was released on December 15, 2006. 

== Plot ==
A litter of pigs are born to the Arable farm. One is a runt so John Arable decides to "do away with it". However, when his daughter, Fern Arable, hears of the pig's fate she rescues him and tells her dad that it's absurd to kill it just because it's smaller than the others. She gets to raise him and names him "Wilbur". However, after only six months of raising him, John Arable tells Fern that it's time for him to be sold (his sibling were already sold). Fern sadly says Good-bye as the young pig is sold down the steet to her uncle, Homer Zuckerman. When Wilbur wants a play with a lamb, the lamb's father (known as a ram) says that sheep don't play with pigs because it's only a matter of time before they are turned into smoked bacon and ham. Wilbur starts crying saying that he doesn't want to die, but a voice from above tells him to "chin up". The next day she sings a song about "chining up", and revels herself to be a spider named Charlotte. She saves Wilbur buy writing messages in her web, hence the title. She eventually dies, and although 511 of her children leave the barn (she had 514), three of them stay. But as much as Wilbur loves them, they will never replace the memory of Charlotte.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
A reviewer on [[Filmcritc]] said that the animation was pretty bad, but the story was good. "The 1973 animation (courtesy of Hanna-Barbera) is nothing special, in fact it's often downright ''bad'', but E.B. White's classic fable needs little to make it come to life. Especially giddy is Paul Lynde's wry Templeton the rat ("It says: Crunchy."), whom I oddly still quote today. Fortunately, the new DVD gives us a widescreen presentation of the film that is scratch-and-pop-free." The reviewer went on to say that the film is "a must-own for anyone with children, and a must-see for everyone else.", and rated it four out of five stars. <ref>http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/84dbbfa4d710144986256c290016f76e/775fcb01f0f7bfcb88256c41000e0425?OpenDocument</ref> [[Rotton Tomatos]] reported that 74% of the 19 reviewers gave the film a freash rating, with a score of 6.6. <ref>http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1003952-charlottes_web/</ref> The RT community gave the film an 86% apporval rating, with a score of 7/10. Some major critism for the film is simply for the animation, as it's from [[Hana-Barbra]]. 
<ref>http://apolloguide.com/mov_fullrev.asp?CID=3484</ref> <ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070016/usercomments</ref> <ref>http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:9012~T1</ref> The [[Allmovie]] Guide rated the film three out of five stars and said: "[[E.B. White]]'s classic Charlotte's Web is one of the 20th century's most beloved children's books. The film version is a faithful adaptation, retaining all of the characters -- and most of their characteristics. The gentle but mysterious and at times discomforting tone of the original has been kept, and no attempt has been made to soften the existential sadness at the story's core -- the lesson that everyone lives and then dies, even if that death is successfully postponed for a while. Despite this, the film has the book's generally cheerful and optimistic tone. Voice characterizations are good, with Debbie Reynolds]] a properly maternal and compassionate Charlotte and [[Henry Gibson]] innocent and unassuming as Wilbur. [[Paul Lynde]]'s Templeton is a standout, as would be expected from the natural mating of actor and role. The film's good points are undermined somewhat by a lackluster score (although the title song is rather haunting) and more seriously by the mediocre animation. Although better than its work for television, Hanna-Barbera's animation is too stiff and money-conscious to do justice to the story. That said, the backgrounds are generally very good, and some sequences involving weather and seasons are very effective. While the lack of top-drawer animation dilutes the film's effectiveness, it is still a fine and worthwhile adaptation." <ref>http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:9012~T1</ref> Many people have also said that the songs by the [[Sherman Brothers]] are weak, while others have said that the songs are great and/or classic. <ref>http://apolloguide.com/mov_fullrev.asp?CID=3484</ref> <ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070016/usercomments</ref> <ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070016/usercomments?filter=chrono;start=60</ref> <ref>http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:9012~T1</ref> <ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070016/board/nest/87345297</ref> The first comment on IMDb, written on January 25, 1999, and headed as "What a Waist!" said: "If ever a film sucked all the charm and merit from a text, this is it. The characterisations are inane, the songs are instantly forgettable (and why are there songs anyway?), the animation is tacky. Who let Hanna Barbera get there sticky hands on the rights? If someone had to screw it up it should have been Disney. I think its time for a remake in the style of Babe. And let's burn all the master tapes from this version."

=== E.B. White's Reaction ===
According to [[Gene Deitch]], a director of animation and friend of E.B. White, the author's wife wrote the following words in a 1977 letter: "We have never ceased to regret that your version of "Charlotte's Web" never got made. The Hanna-Barberra version has never pleased either of us... a travesty..."<ref>Deitch, Gene. [http://genedeitch.awn.com/index.php3?ltype=chapter&chapter=27&page=4 How to Succeed in Animation: Chapter 27: A Tangled Web (p.3)]. 2001. Accessed on: September 27, 2008.</ref> E.B. White himself wrote of the film: "The story is interrupted every few minutes so that somebody can sing a jolly song. I don't care much for jolly songs. The Blue Hill Fair, which I tried to report faithfully in the book, has become a Disney World, with 76 trombones. But that's what you get for getting embroiled in Hollywood."<ref>Burr, Ty.
