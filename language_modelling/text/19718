The '''l<U+014D>r<U+012B>ca segment<U+0101>ta''' (''segmented plates'') was a type of laminated or [[laminar armour]] (metal strips fashioned into circular bands).<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=heaA2LijDVUC&pg=PA16&dq=roman+laminated+armor&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7gCRT67rCIam8QTXmNHvAw&ved=0CFIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=roman%20laminated%20armor&f=false ''Sassanian Elite Cavalry Ad 224-642'', Author Kaveh Farrokh, Publisher Osprey Publishing, 2005, ISBN 1841767131, 9781841767130 P.16]</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=7hHTAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA83&dq=lorica+laminata&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5QSRT9f5OoWatwevqcHLBA&ved=0CEEQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=lorica%20laminata&f=false ''A concise dictionary of Greek and Roman antiquities, Author Sir William Smith, Publisher Murray, 1898, Original from Indiana University, Digitized Mar 17, 2009 P.82-83]</ref> The [[Latin]] name was first used in the 16th century (the ancient form is unknown, although it is possible that the Romans referred to the armour as "''lorica laminata''").{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
The armour itself consisted of broad metallic strips ("girth hoops") fastened to internal [[leather]] straps.
The plates of lorica segmentata armour were soft iron inside and (some at least) were mild steel on the outside.<ref>David Sim (at Reading University)</ref> This was a deliberate act, called case hardening, and is carried out by enriching the surface iron with carbon from organic materials packed tightly around the piece which is then heated in a forge.<ref name= "Iron for the Eagles, by David Sim& Isabel Ridge, p.96">"Iron for the Eagles", by David Sim& Isabel Ridge</ref> 
The strips were arranged horizontally on the body, overlapping downwards, and they surrounded the torso in two halves, being fastened at the front and back. The upper body and shoulders were protected by additional strips ("shoulder guards") and breast- and backplates. The form of the armour allowed it to be stored very compactly, since it was possible to separate it into four sections. The fitments that closed the various plate sections together (buckles, lobate hinges, hinged straps, tie-hooks, tie-rings, etc.) were, however, made of [[brass]]. However, in later variants dating from around 75<U+2013>80 A.D., the fastenings of the armor were simplified. Bronze hinges were removed in favor of simple rivets, belt fastenings utilized small hooks, and the lowest two girdle plates were replaced by one broad plate.

==History==
During the time of their use, this style of armor evolved and changed a number of times and ways, the currently recognised types being the [[Kalkriese]], [[Corbridge]] and [[Newstead, Scottish Borders|Newstead]] types, named after their places of discovery. There was, however, a considerable overlap between these types in use and the Corbridge and Newstead types are often found at the same site (e.g. at [[Caerleon]] in [[Wales]], [[Carnuntum]] in [[Austria]], [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] in England and [[Le<U+00F3>n, Spain|Le<U+00F3>n]] in [[Spain]]). It is possible that there was a fourth type, a hybrid of the banded armour together with [[scale armour|scale]] shoulder defences. However, this is only known from one badly damaged statue originating at [[Alba Iulia]] in [[Romania]]. The currently accepted range for the use of the armour is from about 9 B.C. ([[Dangstetten]]) to the late 3rd century A.D. (Le<U+00F3>n). Its use was geographically widespread but [[mail (armour)|mail]] may have been more common at all times.

==Uses==
The question as to precisely who used the armour is debated. There is a clear difference in  armour between the two corps shown on [[Trajan's Column]]. This is a monument erected in 113 in Rome to commemorate the conquest of [[Dacia]] by Emperor [[Trajan]] (ruled 98<U+2013>117): its [[bas-reliefs]] are a key source for Roman military equipment. ''[[Auxilia]]'' are generally shown wearing mail (''[[lorica hamata]]'') [[cuirasses]] and carrying oval shields. Legionaries are uniformly depicted wearing ''lorica segmentata'' and with curved rectangular shields.<ref>L. Rossi ''Trajan's Column and the Dacian Wars'' (Thames & Hudson 1971) 102</ref> On this basis, it has been supposed that lorica segmentata was used by legionaries only.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} However, some historians consider Trajan's Column to be inaccurate as a historical source due to its inaccurate and stylized portrayal of Roman armor: "...it is probably safest to interpret the Column reliefs as <U+2018>impressions<U+2019>, rather than accurate representations." <ref name="Lorica-Segmentata-Volume-I-A-Handbook-of-Articulated-Roman-Plate-Armour">Bishop, M.C. ''Lorica Segmentata Volume I'' p. 9-10</ref> 

The view that ''auxilia'' were light troops originates from Vegetius' comment that "''auxilia'' are always joined as light troops with the legions in the line".<ref>Vegetius op cit II.2</ref> It is true that some specialist units in the ''auxilia'', such as Syrian archers and [[Numidian cavalry]] wore light armour (or none). But they were a small minority of the ''auxilia''. Most auxiliary ''cohortes'' contained heavy infantry similar to legionaries.<ref name="Goldsworthy Roman Warfare 127">Goldsworthy ''Roman Warfare'' 127</ref>

However, on another Trajanic monument (the [[Tropaeum Traiani|Adamclisi ''Tropaeum'']]) the ''lorica segmentata'' does not appear at all, and legionaries and ''auxilia'' alike are depicted wearing either mail or scales (''[[lorica squamata]]''). Some experts are of the opinion that the Adamclisi monument is a more accurate portrayal of normality,<ref>Mattingly op cit 207</ref> with the ''segmentata'' used rarely, maybe only for set-piece battles and parades. This viewpoint considers the figures in Trajan's Column to be highly stereotyped, in order to distinguish clearly between different types of troops.<ref>Rossi op cit 59</ref> In any event, both corps were equipped with the same weapons: ''[[gladius]]'' (a close-combat stabbing sword) and javelins, although the type of javelin known as ''[[pilum]]'' seems to have been provided to legionaries only.<ref>Goldsworthy ''Complete Roman Army'' 136</ref> Goldsworthy points out that the equipment of both corps were roughly equal in weight.<ref name="Goldsworthy Roman Warfare 127"/>

In recent years archaeology has found fittings of ''lorica segmentata'' in many fort sites that are thought to have been garrisoned by only [[Roman auxiliaries|auxiliary troops]], ''i.e.'', where the legions were '''not''' based. If the legions were, indeed, broken up and distributed around all these small bases, then it implies a tactical use of the legions that has not previously been considered. Hitherto, the legions were regarded as shock troops employed only ''en masse'' and not broken up into detachments. M.C. Bishop, however, has argued that we need to examine the way in which the various troop types were armed and deduce from this what their battle roles were, rather than trying to consider who-wore-what. Succinctly put, the legions were armed and trained for close-order combat while the auxiliary forces, just as numerous, were more accustomed to open order fighting, although they could be employed as the legions were (e.g. at [[Mons Graupius]]) if circumstances demanded this.<ref>For a full discussion of this topic, see Bishop, M.C. (2002), "Lorica segmentata, Volume 1: A Handbook of Articulated Roman Plate Armour", ''Journal of Roman Military Equipment Studies'', Monograph No.1.</ref>

==Last uses and disappearance==
During the 3rd century, all ''[[peregrini]]'' were granted [[Roman citizenship]], and therefore legionaries lost their social superiority.<ref>Goldsworthy Complete Roman Army 209</ref> The ''lorica segmentata'' eventually disappeared from Roman use, most likely due to its high cost and difficult maintenance despite its good qualities, although it appears to have still been in use into the early 4th century, being depicted in the [[Arch of Constantine]] erected in 315 during the reign of [[Constantine I]] to commemorate his military achievements.[http://www.rome101.com/Portraiture/Constantine/pix/AtticS34_L.jpg] (However, it has been argued that these depictions are from an earlier monument by [[Marcus Aurelius]], from which Constantine incorporated portions into his Arch.)<ref>Lorica Segmentata Volume I: A Handbook of Articulated Roman Plate Armour, Pg.21, Fig 2.4</ref> Recently there has been evidence of a ''lorica segmentata'' found in Spain, dating from the third century.[http://www.romanarmytalk.com/rat/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=26427] What is more surprising is that it was found in an area where, as far as we know, only ''[[limitanei]]'' operated. (''Limitanei'' are seen as poorer-quality troops than the contemporary mobile field armies of the ''[[comitatenses]]''.)

Similar armouring techniques were used during the 16th century, employing sliding [[rivet]]s. This was known as [[Anima (armour)|anima]].

==Popular culture==

The Lorica Segmentata has come to be viewed as synonymous with the Roman legions in pop culture depictions. This tendency even extends to time periods where its employment is so early or late as to be [[anachronistic]](out of its place in time).
