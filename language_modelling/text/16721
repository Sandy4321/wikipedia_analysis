'''Togo''', officially the '''Togolese Republic''', is a narrow country in [[West Africa]] bordering [[Ghana]] to the west, [[Benin]] to the east and [[Burkina Faso]] to the north.  The country extends south to the [[Gulf of Guinea]], on which the capital [[Lom<U+00E9>]] is located. The official language is [[French language|French]]; however, there are many other languages spoken there as well.

Togo has 5,000,000+ population, which is dependent mainly on [[agriculture]]. The weather is mild and makes for good growing seasons. Togo is a [[sub-tropical]], [[sub-Saharan]] nation.

Togo gained its independance from [[France]] in 1960. In 1967 [[Gnassingb<U+00E9> Eyad<U+00E9>ma]], the former leader of the country, led a military coup, after which he became President. Eyad<U+00E9>ma is the longest serving leader in African history. 


== History ==
{{main|History of Togo}}
Western history does not record what happened in Togo before the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] arrived in the late [[15th century|fifteenth century]]. During the period from the [[11th century|eleventh century]] to the [[16th century|sixteenth century]], various tribes entered the region from all directions: the [[Ewe people|Ew<U+00E9>]] from [[Nigeria]] and [[Benin]]; and the [[Gen language|Mina]] and [[Guin]] from [[Ghana]]. Most settled in coastal areas. When the slave trade began in earnest in the sixteenth century, the Mina benefited the most. For the next two hundred years, the coastal region was a major raiding center for Europeans in search of slaves, earning Togo and the surrounding region the name "[[Slave Coast|The Slave Coast]]." 

In an 1884 treaty signed at [[Togoville]], Germany declared a protectorate over a stretch of territory along the coast and gradually extended its control inland. This became the [[German colony]] [[Togoland]] in 1905. After the German defeat during [[World War I]] in August 1914 at the hands of British troops (coming from the Gold Coast) and the French troops (coming from [[Dahomey]]), Togoland became two [[League of Nations mandate]]s, administered by the United Kingdom and France.  After [[World War II]], these mandates became [[United Nations Trust Territories|UN Trust Territories]]. The residents of [[British Togoland]] voted to join the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] as part of the new independent nation of [[Ghana]], and [[French Togoland]] became an autonomous republic within the [[French Union]]. Independence came in 1960 under [[Sylvanus Olympio]]. Sylvanus Olympio was assassinated in a military coup on [[January 13]] [[1963]] by a group of soldiers under the direction of [[Gnassingb<U+00E9> Eyad<U+00E9>ma|Sergeant Etienne Eyadema Gnassingbe]]. Opposition leader [[Nicolas Grunitzky]] was appointed president by the "Insurrection Committee" headed by [[Emmanuel Bodjoll<U+00E9>]]. However, on [[January 13]] [[1967]], Eyadema Gnassingbe overthrew Grunitzky in a bloodless coup and assumed the presidency, which he held from that date until his sudden death on [[February 5]] [[2005]].

[[Gnassingb<U+00E9> Eyad<U+00E9>ma|Eyadema Gnassingbe]] died in early 2005 after thirty-eight years in power, as Africa's longest-sitting dictator. The military's immediate but short-lived installation of his son, [[Faure Gnassingbe]], as president provoked widespread international condemnation, except from [[France]]. However, surprisingly, some democratically elected African leaders, such as [[Abdoulaye Wade]] of [[Senegal]] and [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] of [[Nigeria]], supported that move and created a rift within the [[African Union]]. Faure Gnassingbe stood down and called elections which he won two months later. The opposition claimed that the election was fraudulent. The developments of 2005 led to renewed questions about a commitment to democracy made by Togo in 2004 in a bid to normalize ties with the [[European Union]], which cut off aid in 1993 over the country's human rights record. Moreover, up to 400 people were killed in the political violence surrounding the presidential poll, according to the United Nations. Around 40,000 Togolese fled to neighbouring countries.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Togo}}

Togo's small [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan]] economy is heavily dependent on both commercial and subsistence [[agriculture]], which provides employment for 65% of the labor force. [[cotton]], [[coffee]], and [[cocoa]] together generate about 30% of export earnings. Togo is self-sufficient in basic foodgoods when harvests are normal, with occasional regional supply difficulties. In the industrial sector, [[phosphate]] mining is no longer the most important activity, as cement and clinker export to neighbouring countries have taken over. It has suffered from the collapse of world phosphate prices, increased foreign competition and financial problems . Togo's [[Gross National Income|GNI]] per capita is [[US$]]380 (World Bank, 2005). [[Image:Togo phosphates mining.jpg|thumb|Phosphate mining by SNPT company]]

Togo serves as a regional commercial and trade center.  The government's decade-long effort, supported by the [[World Bank]] and the [[IMF]], to implement economic reform measures, encourage foreign investment, and bring revenues in line with expenditures, has stalled. Political unrest, including private and public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993, jeopardized the reform program, shrank the tax base, and disrupted vital economic activity.  The [[12 January]] [[1994]] devaluation of the currency by 50% provided an important impetus to renewed structural adjustment; these efforts were facilitated by the end of strife in 1994 and a return to overt political calm.  Progress depends on increased openness in government financial operations (to accommodate increased social service outlays) and possible downsizing of the [[military]], on which the regime has depended to stay in place.  Lack of aid, along with depressed cocoa prices, generated a 1% fall in GDP in 1998, with growth resuming in 1999.  Assuming no deterioration of the political atmosphere, growth is expected to rise {{Fact|date=August 2008}}.

== Development and Environment ==
== Geography ==
[[Image:To-map.png|left|200px]]
{{main|Geography of Togo}}
{{MapLibrary|Togo_sat.png|Togo}}
Togo is a small, thin sub-Saharan nation. It borders the [[Bight of Benin]] in the south; [[Ghana]] lies to the west; [[Benin]] to the east; and to the north Togo is bound by [[Burkina Faso]].

In the north the land is characterized by a gently rolling savannah in contrast to the center of the country, which is characterized by hills. The south of Togo is characterized by a plateau which reaches to a coastal plain with extensive lagoons and marshes.  The land size is 21,925 [[square mile]]s (56,785&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), with an average population density of 253 people per square mile (98/km<U+00B2>). In 1914 it changed from Togoland to Togo.

===Climate===
The climate is generally tropical with average temperatures ranging from 27<U+00B0>C on the coast to about 30<U+00B0>C in the northernmost regions, with a dry climate and  characteristics of a [[tropical savanna]]. To the south there are two seasons of rain (the first between April and July and the second between October and November), even though the average rainfall is not very high (about 1,000 mm in mountainous areas, the most rainy).

== Administrative divisions ==
{{main|Regions of Togo|Prefectures of Togo}}
Togo is divided into 5 [[region]]s, which are subdivided in turn into 30 [[prefecture]]s and 1 [[Lom<U+00E9>|commune]].  From north to south the regions are [[Savanes Region, Togo|Savanes]], [[Kara Region|Kara]], [[Centrale Region|Centrale]], [[Plateaux Region, Togo|Plateaux]] and [[Maritime Region|Maritime]].

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Togo}}
[[Image:Togo demography.png|thumb|right|450px|Demographic evolution of Togo]]

With a population of 5,548,702 (as of 2006), Togo is the 107th largest country by population. Most of the population (65%) live in rural villages dedicated to agriculture or pastures. The population of Togo shows a strong growth: from 1961 (the year after independence) to 2003 it quintupled. 

===Ethnic groups===
In Togo there are about 45 different ethnic groups, the most important and numerous are the [[Ewe people|Ewe]] in the south (46%), [[Kaby<U+00E9>]] in the north (22%). Another classification lists Uaci or Ouatchis (14%) as a separate ethnic group from the Ewe which brings the porportion of Ewe down to (32%). However, there are no historical and ethnical facts that justify the separation between Ewes and Ouatchis. On the contrary, the term Ouatchi relates to a subgroup of Ewes which migrated south during the 16th century from Notse the ancient Ewe Kingdom capital. This classification is inaccurate and has been contested for being politically biased; Mina, Mossi, and Aja (about 8%) are the remainder; and under 1% are European expatriates live in Togo as diplomats and for economic reasons.

=== Religion ===
About half the population adheres to indigenous, [[animism|animist]] beliefs <ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/to.html#source ''CIA World Fact Book'']</ref>. [[Christianity]] is the second largest religious group, to which 29% of the country's population belong. The remaining 21% of Togolese follow [[Islam]].

{{update}}
{{main|Politics of Togo}}<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
Togo's transition to democracy is stalled. Its democratic institutions remain nascent and fragile. President [[Gnassingb<U+00E9> Eyad<U+00E9>ma]], who ruled Togo under a one-party system for nearly twenty-five of his thirty-seven years in power, died of a heart attack on [[February 5]] [[2005]]. Under the constitution, the speaker of parliament, [[Fambar<U+00E9> Ouattara Natchaba]], should have become president, pending a new election. Natchaba was out of the country, returning on an Air France plane from Paris. The Togolese army closed the nation's borders, forcing the plane to land in nearby Benin. With an engineered power vacuum, the army announced that Eyad<U+00E9>ma's son [[Faure Gnassingb<U+00E9>]], also known as Faure Eyad<U+00E9>ma, who had been the communications minister, would succeed him. The constitution of Togo declared that in the case of the president's death, the speaker of Parliament takes his place, and has sixty days to call new elections. However, on February 6th, Parliament retroactively changed the Constitution, declaring that Faure would hold office for the rest of his father's term, with elections deferred until 2008.  The stated justification was that Natchaba was out of the country.<ref>Japan Post, [http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1107659938613]</ref> . The government also moved to remove Natchaba as speaker <ref>[http://www.republicoftogo.com/fr/news/news.asp?rubID=4&srubID=75&themeID=1&newsID=9170]</ref> and replaced him with Faure Gnassingb<U+00E9>, who was sworn in on [[February 7]], [[2005]], despite the international criticism of the succession. [http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/afp/20050207/wl_afp/togopolitics_050207180309]

The African Union described the takeover as a military [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]]. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4241001.stm]  International pressure came also from the [[United Nations]].  Within Togo, opposition to the takeover culminated in riots in which several hundred died.  In the village of [[An<U+00E9>ho]] reports of a general civilian uprising followed by a large scale massacre by government troops went largely unreported.  In response, Gnassingb<U+00E9> agreed to hold [[Togo presidential election, 2005|elections]]  and on [[February 25]], Gnassingb<U+00E9> resigned as president, but soon afterwards accepted the nomination to run for the office in April.  On [[April 24]], 2005, Gnassingb<U+00E9> was elected president of Togo, receiving over 60% of the vote according to official results.  However fraud was suspected as cause of his election, due to a lack of presence of the European Union or other such oversight. See the History section of this article for details.  Parliament designated Deputy Speaker [[Bonfoh Abbass]] as interim president until the inauguration of the election a clear violation of the constitution but a political compromise.

===Current political situation===
On [[May 3]], 2006, Faure Gnassingbe was sworn in as the new president, garnering 60% of the vote according to official results. Discontent has continued however, with the opposition declaring the voting rigged, claiming the military stole ballot boxes from various polling stations in the South, as well as other election irregularities, such as telecommunication shutdown. [http://www.scidev.net/gateways/index.cfm?fuseaction=readitem&rgwid=4&item=Opinions&itemid=401&language=1] The European Union has suspended aid in support of the opposition claims, while the African Union and the United States have declared the vote "reasonably fair" and accepted the outcome. The Nigerian president and Chair of the AU, [[Olus<U+1EB9>gun <U+1ECC>basanj<U+1ECD>]], has sought to negotiate between the incumbent government and the opposition to establish a coalition government, but rejected an AU Commission appointment of former [[Zambia]]n president, [[Kenneth Kaunda]], as special AU envoy to Togo ([http://allafrica.com/stories/200506060694.html] and [http://allafrica.com/stories/200507040093.html]). Later in June, President Gnassingbe named opposition leader [[Edem Kodjo]] as the prime Minister.

In April 2006 reconciliation talks between government and opposition progressed; said talks were suspended after  [[Gnassingb<U+00E9> Eyadema]]'s death in 2005. In August both parties signed the Ouagadougou agreement calling for a transitional unity government to organize parliamentary elections. On September 16th, the president nominated [[Yaovi Agboyibor]] of the [[Action Committee for Renewal]]  (CAR) prime minister snubing the major opposition party [[Union of the Forces of Change]] (UFC) which in reaction refused to join the government. Professor [[L<U+00E9>opold Gnininvi]]  of the  [[Democratic Convention of African Peoples]] (CDPA) was appointed the 20th. From the beginning, opposition's weakness was manifest. The president had the final say on who would be cabinet minister from a list of names proposed by the prime minister. Second, disunity was rife within opposition ranks after the failure to get UFC representation in the transitional government. 

In October 2007, after several postponements, elections were held under proportional representation. This allowed the less populated north to seat as many MPs the more populated south. The president backed party [[Rally of the Togolese People]] (RPT) won outright majority with the UFC coming second with the other parties claiming inconsequential representation. Again vote rigging accusations were leveled at the RPT supported by  the civil and military security apparatus. Despite the presence of an EU observer mission, cancelled ballots and illegal voting took place the majority of which in RPT strongholds. The elections was declared fair by the international community and praised as a model with few intimidation and violent acts for the first time since multipartism was reinstated. On December 3rd [[Komlan Mally]]  of the RPT was appointed to prime minister succeeding Agboyibor.

However presidential elections of 2010 presents a different challenge with no proportional representation effect to balance for geographic location. The executive power is mainly presidential and this showdown fallout will really determine how far the country has come in terms of democratic rule.

== Culture ==
 
[[Image:Togo Taberma house 04.jpg|thumb|Traditional Taberma houses]]
{{seealso|Music of Togo}}
Togo's [[culture]] reflects the influences of its thirty-seven ethnic groups, the largest and most influential of which are the [[Ewe people|Ewe]], [[Mina]], and [[Kabre]]. 
 
[[French language|French]] is the official language of Togo.  The many indigenous [[African languages]] spoken by Togolese include:  [[Gbe languages]] such as [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Gen language|Mina]], and [[Aja languages|Aja]];  [[Kabiy<U+00E9> language|Kabiy<U+00E9>]]; and others. 
 
Despite the influences of Christianity and Islam, over half of the people of Togo follow native [[animistic]] practices and beliefs.
 
[[Ewe people|Ewe]] statuary is characterized by its famous [[statuettes]] which illustrate the worship of the [[ibeji]].  Sculptures and hunting trophies were used rather than the more ubiquitous African masks.  The wood-carvers of [[Kloto]] are famous for their "chains of marriage": two characters are connected by rings drawn from only one piece of wood.
 
The dyed fabric [[batik]]s of the artisanal center of [[Kloto]] represent stylized and coloured scenes of ancient everyday life.  The loincloths used in the ceremonies of the weavers of [[Assahoun]] are famous.  Works of the painter [[Sokey Edorh]] are inspired by the immense arid extents, swept by the harmattan, and where the laterite keeps the prints of the men and the animals.  The plastics technician [[Paul Ahyi]] is internationally recognized today.  He practices the "[[zota]]", a kind of pyroengraving, and his monumental achievements decorate [[Lome]].

== Sport ==
As in much of [[Africa]], [[football (soccer)|football]] is the most popular sporting pursuit. Until 2006, Togo was very much a minor force in world football, but like fellow West African nations such as [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]], [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] before them, the [[Togo national football team|Togolese national team]] finally qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup 2006|World Cup]]. Until his dismissal from the team over a long-standing bonus dispute[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/6494073.stm], [[Emmanuel Adebayor]] was largely considered the side's star player. He currently plays for [[FA Premier League|English Premiership]] club, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Togo was knocked out of the tournament in the group stage after losing to [[South Korea]], [[Switzerland]] and [[France]]. [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bild:Togo-nationalmannschaft.jpg Photo of the team] 

Togo's 2006 World Cup appearance was marred by a dispute over financial bonuses, a situation that almost led to the team boycotting their match against [[Switzerland]]. Eventually, Togo did fulfil all three fixtures, failing to qualify for the second round of the competition. Over the following months, the stalemate has continued to mar Togolese football, and eventually resulted in the dismissal of strike pair [[Emmanuel Adebayor]] and [[Kader Cougbadja]], and defender [[Nibombe Dare]] in March 2007, ostensibly for "indecent remarks concerning the FTF management"<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/6494073.stm BBC SPORT | Football | African | Togo axe Adebayor and two others<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

After their outings as World Cup underdogs, Togo gained support throughout the world. For example, Togo has a 'Supporters Club' in Levenmouth in Scotland, whilst the Newry Togo Supporters Club has its own bar as a venue in Newry, Northern Ireland. 

On [[August 12]], [[2008]], [[Benjamin Boukpeti]] (a Frenchman representing the nation) won a bronze medal in the Men's K1 Kayak Slalom, the first ever medal for Togo at the Olympics.
