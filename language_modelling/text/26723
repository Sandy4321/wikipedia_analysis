Drafted by the [[Buffalo Sabres]] in the first round (16th overall) of the [[1995 NHL Entry Draft]], he spent the first half of his sixteen-year [[National Hockey League]] career with the Sabres, later having stints with the [[Philadelphia Flyers]], [[New York Islanders]], and [[New York Rangers]]. He now works as an analyst on [[MSG (TV channel)|MSG]].<ref>{{cite web|author=colleen.murphy |url=http://www.msg.com/msg-news/msg-networks-taps-martin-biron-for-rangers-telecasts-.html |title=MSG Networks Taps Martin Biron For Rangers Telecasts |publisher=Msg.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref>

==Playing career==

===Buffalo Sabres===
[[Image:Martin Biron3.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Martin Biron in goal for Buffalo.]]
Biron started his hockey career on the [[Beauport Harfangs]] of the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] (QMJHL).Biron made his NHL debut with the [[Buffalo Sabres]] on December 26, 1995.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/sports/hockey/after-dreadful-road-trip-rangers-place-a-veteran-goalie-on-waivers.html?_r=0</ref> After posting a 5.04 [[goals against average]], with no wins and two losses during the [[1995<U+2013>96 NHL season|1995<U+2013>96 season]], he was sent back to the QMJHL to improve. After the [[2000<U+2013>01 NHL season|2000<U+2013>01 season]], he was a consistent goaltender for the Sabres as his play in the crease improved drastically.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Biron, along with [[Rob Ray]] and [[Dominik Ha<U+0161>ek]], was one of the three Sabres against whom, in three consecutive years, the NHL made a specific rule. After NHL statisticians discovered a bug in their new stat-tracking software, the "Biron rule" restricted jersey numbers to whole numbers between 1 and 99 (later limited to numbers between 1 and 98 after the league-wide retirement of number 99 for [[Wayne Gretzky]]). Biron was the only NHL player affected as only he wore "00" at the time. (Goaltender [[John Davidson (ice hockey)|John Davidson]] also wore 00 during his playing career, without rebuke, at various points in his playing career between 1973 and 1983.) Upon his return to the NHL three seasons later, Biron switched to number 43, and wore that number until the end of his career.

Biron became the Sabres' starting goaltender after Ha<U+0161>ek's departure from Buffalo in 2001 and held the position until the [[2004<U+2013>05 NHL lockout]]. Biron has always been a fan favorite in Buffalo and although he no longer plays there, he currently resides in the city during the offseason.<ref>Vogl, John (September 21, 2012).

===Philadelphia Flyers===
[[image:Biron, Martin2.jpg|thumb|right|Biron with the Flyers during the [[2008-09 NHL season]].]]
After losing the number one goaltending job to youngster [[Ryan Miller]], Biron requested a trade from the Sabres on June 26, 2006, in an effort to receive more playing time. Finally, on February 27, 2007, the Sabres traded Biron to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] for a second round draft pick.<ref>{{cite news | title = Sabres deal Biron to Flyers, get Conklin | publisher = Canadian Press | date = 2007-02-27 | url = http://tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=197883&hubname=nhl= | accessdate = 2007-02-28 }}</ref>

On March 27, 2007, Biron signed a two-year, $7 million contract extension with the Flyers to be the starting goalie in Philadelphia. After appearing in 62 games and recording 30 wins in the [[2007<U+2013>08 NHL season|2007<U+2013>08 season]], he led the Flyers to the Eastern Conference Finals, losing in five games to the Eastern Conference champion [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]. He appeared in 55 games for the Flyers in the [[2008-09 NHL Season]], winning 29 and helping the Flyers to the 5th overall seed in the Eastern Conference.

===New York Islanders===
[[image:Martin Biron NYI.jpg|thumb|left|Biron with the Islanders]]
On July 1, 2009, Biron entered free agency. He was soon left in a difficult position after the Flyers signed goaltenders [[Ray Emery]] and [[Brian Boucher]], while other teams quickly filled up their goaltending roster needs. Biron soon signed a one-year, $1.4 million contract with the [[New York Islanders]] on July 22, 2009,<ref>{{cite news | title = Isles sign goalie Martin Biron to a one-year deal | publisher = National Hockey League | date = 2009-07-22 | url = http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=451178 | accessdate = 2009-07-22 }}</ref> joining goaltenders [[Dwayne Roloson]] and [[Rick DiPietro]]. In 29 appearances, Biron recorded 9 wins to go with 14 losses and 4 overtime losses, with a 3.27 goals against average and .896 save percentage. The Islanders did not qualify for the post-season.

===New York Rangers===
On July 1, 2010, Biron signed a two-year, $1.75 million deal with the [[New York Rangers]], where he prepared to back up Swedish starter [[Henrik Lundqvist]]. Biron is one of four players in NHL history to skate for all three teams based in the state of New York. The others were [[Mike Donnelly]] and former teammates [[Jason Dawe (ice hockey)|Jason Dawe]] and [[Pat LaFontaine]], Biron will have played almost his entire career in the state of New York, except for a brief 2{{fraction|1|2}}-year stint with the [[Philadelphia Flyers]].

On February 28, 2011, Biron fractured his collarbone during practice, and was forced to miss the remainder of the 2010<U+2013>2011 season. While Biron played the shortest number of games (17) since his second NHL season in 1998-99, he posted career highs in [[save percentage]] (.923) and [[goals against average]] (2.13).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/01/sports/hockey/01trades.html|title=At Deadline, Rangers Are Unable to Fill Sudden Need|author=Klein, Jeff Z.|date=February 28, 2011|publisher=NY Times online|accessdate=March 1, 2011}}</ref>{{update after|2011|06|30}}
On June 29, 2012 Biron re-signed with the New York Rangers. The [[one-way contract]] is worth $2.6 million over two years, working out to an average of $1.3 million per year.{{cn|date=December 2013}}

On October 14, 2013, the Rangers placed Biron on waivers after a poor start to the season,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=434104 |title=Rangers place forward Asham, goaltender Biron on waivers |publisher=Tsn.ca |date=2013-10-14 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref> and the following day he was assigned to play with the [[Hartford Wolf Pack]] of the [[American Hockey League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blueshirtsunited.com/posts/4042/asham-biron-assigned-to-hartford#.Ul4FxhCqXwB |title=Asham, Biron Assigned to Hartford |publisher=Blueshirts United |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}</ref> Biron announced his retirement via social media on October 20, 2013, choosing retirement over playing in the minor leagues.<ref name=retired>{{cite news|last=TSN.ca staff|title=BIRON ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT AFTER 16 NHL SEASONS|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=434598|accessdate=20 October 2013|newspaper=TSN.ca|date=29 October 2013}}</ref> He ended his career with a 230-191-25-27 record, 2.62 goals against average and a .910 save percentage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vinny Lecavalier Moved to First Line, Martin Biron Retires|url=http://www.sportsmedia101.com/philadelphiaflyers/2013/10/22/vinny-lecavalier-moved-to-first-line-martin-biron-retires/}}</ref>
