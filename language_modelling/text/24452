'''Wernher Magnus Maximilian [[Freiherr]] ''('Baron')'''''<ref>{{German title Freiherr}}</ref>''' von Braun''' ([[March 23]] [[1912]] &ndash; [[June 16]] [[1977]]) was one of the leading figures in the development of [[rocket]] technology in [[Germany]] and the [[United States]]. The German [[scientist]], who was pivotal in Germany's pre-war rocket development program and was responsible for the design and realization of the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] combat rocket during [[World War II]], entered the United States at the end of the war through the then-secret [[Operation Paperclip]]. 

Although he had held the honorary [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] rank of a [[Sturmbannf<U+00FC>hrer]], he became a naturalized [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizen]] and worked on the American [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM) program before joining [[NASA]], where he served as director of NASA's [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] and the chief architect of the [[Saturn V]] launch vehicle, the superbooster that propelled the United States to the Moon <ref>[http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/bio.html]</ref>. He is generally regarded as the father of the [[Space Race|United States space program]]. Wernher von Braun received the 1975 [[National Medal of Science]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Wernher von Braun  was born in [[Wyrzysk|Wirsitz]], [[Province of Posen]], in the German [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. He was born second of three sons with an impressive pedigree.  His father, the conservative politician Magnus Freiherr von Braun (1877<U+2013>1972), served as a Minister of Agriculture in the Federal Cabinet during the [[Weimar Republic]]. His mother, Emmy von Quistorp ([[1886-11-03]]<U+2013>1959) could trace ancestry through both her parents to medieval European [[Royal family|royalty]], including King [[Philip III of France]], [[Robert III of Scotland]] and King [[Edward III of England]] through her father, and King [[Abel of Denmark]] through her mother, through the son of Nikolaus von Tecklenburg by Catharina Waterfoer, by whom he descended by seven lines of King [[Sancho I of Portugal]] and his wife [[Dulce Berenguer]]. He also had a younger brother, also named [[Magnus von Braun|Magnus Freiherr von Braun]], born in 1919. Upon Wernher von Braun's  [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]], his mother gave him a telescope, and he discovered a passion for astronomy and the realm of [[outer space]]. When, as a result of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Wirsitz became part of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] in 1920, his family, like many other German families, moved. They settled in [[Berlin]], where the 12-year-old von Braun, inspired by speed records established by [[Max Valier]] and [[Fritz von Opel]]<ref>[http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/recollect-childhood.html "Recollections of Childhood: Early Experiences in Rocketry as Told by Werner Von Braun 1963"]</ref>, caused a major disruption in a crowded street by firing off a toy wagon to which he had attached a number of fireworks. The youngster was taken into custody by the local police until his father came to collect him. 

Starting in 1925 von Braun attended a boarding school at [[Ettersburg]] castle near [[Weimar]] where at first he did not do well in [[physics]] and [[mathematics]]. In 1928 his parents moved him to the Hermann-Lietz-Internat (also a residential school) on the [[East Frisia]]n [[North Sea]] island, [[Spiekeroog]] where he acquired a copy of the book ''[[Die Rakete zu den Planetenr<U+00E4>umen]]'' (''The Rocket into Interplanetary Space'') by rocket pioneer [[Hermann Oberth]]. The idea of space travel had always fascinated von Braun, and from this point on he applied himself to physics and mathematics in order to pursue his interest in rocketry.

Starting in 1930, he attended the [[Technical University of Berlin]], where he joined the ''[[Verein f<U+00FC>r Raumschiffahrt]]'' (VfR, the "Spaceflight Society") and assisted [[Hermann Oberth]] in liquid-fueled rocket motor tests. Although he worked mainly with military rockets for many of his later years, space travel remained his primary goal.

===German career===
====The Prussian rocketeer====
Von Braun was working on his creative doctorate when the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] took over Germany, and rocketry almost immediately became a national agenda. An artillery captain, [[Walter Dornberger]], arranged an Ordnance Department research grant for him, and von Braun then worked next to Dornberger's existing solid-fuel rocket test site at [[Kummersdorf]]. He was awarded a [[doctorate]] in physics ([[aerospace engineering]]) on [[July 27]], [[1934]] for a thesis titled "''About Combustion Tests''." However, this was only the public part of von Braun's work. His actual full thesis, "''Construction, Theoretical, and Experimental Solution to the Problem of the Liquid Propellant Rocket''" (dated April 16, 1934) was kept classified by the Army, and was not published until 1960<ref>Konstruktive, theoretische und experimentelle Beitr<U+00E4>ge zu dem Problem der Fl<U+00FC>ssigkeitsrakete. ''Raketentechnik und Raumfahrtforschung'', Sonderheft 1 (1960), Stuttgart, Germany</ref>. By the end of 1934, his group had successfully launched two rockets that rose to heights of 2.2 and 3.5 [[kilometer]]s.

At the time, [[Germany]] was highly interested in American physicist [[Robert H. Goddard]]'s research. Before [[1939]], German scientists occasionally contacted Goddard directly with technical questions. After that, things got rather tense.  Wernher von Braun used Goddard's plans from various journals and incorporated them into the building of the ''[[Aggregate series|Aggregat 4]]'' (A-4) series of rockets, better known as the V-2.<ref>{{ScienceWorldBiography|title=Robert Goddard|urlname=Goddard}}</ref> In 1963, von Braun reflected on the history of rocketry, and said of Goddard's work: "His rockets ... may have been rather crude by present-day standards, but they blazed the trail and incorporated many features used in our most modern rockets and space vehicles." [http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/recall.html] Goddard confirmed his work was used by von Braun when, after the war ended, Goddard inspected captured German V-2s, and recognized many components which he had invented.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

There were no German rocket societies after the collapse of the VFR, and civilian rocket tests were forbidden by the new [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]]. Only military development was allowed and to this end, a larger facility was erected at the village of [[Peenem<U+00FC>nde]] in northern Germany on the [[Baltic Sea]]. This location was chosen partly on the recommendation of von Braun's mother, who recalled her father's duck-hunting expeditions there. Dornberger became the military commander at Peenem<U+00FC>nde, with von Braun as technical director. In collaboration with the [[Luftwaffe]], the Peenem<U+00FC>nde group developed liquid-fuel rocket engines for aircraft and [[jet-assisted takeoff]]s. They also developed the long-range [[A-4]] [[ballistic missile]] and the [[supersonic]] [[Wasserfall missile|Wasserfall]] [[anti-aircraft missile]].

In November 1937 (other sources: [[December 1]], [[1932]]), von Braun joined the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]]. An [[Office of Military Government, United States]] document dated [[April 23]] [[1947]] states that von Braun joined the Waffen-SS ([[Schutzstaffel]]) horseback riding school in 1933, then the National Socialist Party on [[May 1]] [[1937]] and became an officer in the [[Waffen-SS]] from May 1940 to the end of the war.

Amongst his comments about his NSDAP membership von Braun has said:
<blockquote>I was officially demanded to join the National Socialist Party. At this time (1937) I was already technical director of the Army Rocket Center at Peenem<U+00FC>nde ... My refusal to join the party would have meant that I would have to abandon the work of my life. Therefore, I decided to join. My membership in the party did not involve any political activities ... in Spring 1940, one SS-[[Standartenf<U+00FC>hrer]] (SS Colonel) M<U+00FC>ller ... looked me up in my office at Peenem<U+00FC>nde and told me that [[Reichsf<U+00FC>hrer-SS]] [[Heinrich Himmler]] had sent him with the order to urge me to join the SS. I called immediately on my military superior ... Major-General W. Dornberger. He informed me that ... if I wanted to continue our mutual work, I had no alternative but to join.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}</blockquote>

That claim has been often disputed because in 1940, the Waffen-SS had shown no interest in Peenem<U+00FC>nde yet. Also, the assertion that persons in von Braun's position were pressured to join the Nazi party, let alone the SS, has been disputed. Braun claimed to have worn the SS uniform only once <ref>[http://www.reformation.org/wernher-von-braun.html]</ref>. He began as an [[Untersturmf<U+00FC>hrer]] (Second Lieutenant) and was promoted three times by Himmler, the last time in June 1943 to SS-[[Sturmbannf<U+00FC>hrer]] ([[Wehrmacht]] Major).

[[Image:V-2 rocket diagram (with English labels).svg|right|thumb|Schematic of the A4/V2]]

On [[December 22]], [[1942]], [[Adolf Hitler]] signed the order approving the production of the A-4 as a "vengeance weapon" and the group developed it to target [[London]]. Following von Braun's [[July 7]], [[1943]] presentation of a color movie showing an A-4 taking off, Hitler was so enthusiastic that he personally made him a professor shortly thereafter.<ref>Speer, Albert (1969). ''Erinnerungen'' (p. 377). Verlag Ullstein GmbH, Frankfurt a.M. and Berlin, [ISBN 3-550-06074-2]</ref>  In Germany and at this time, this was an absolutely unusual promotion for an engineer who was only 31 years old.

By now the British and Soviet intelligence agencies were aware of the rocket program and von Braun's team at Peenem<U+00FC>nde. Over the nights of 17th and [[18 August]] [[1943]] [[RAF Bomber Command]]s [[Bombing of Peenem<U+00FC>nde in World War II|Operation Hydra]] despatched raids on the Peenem<U+00FC>nde camp consisting of 596 aircraft and dropping 1,800 tons of explosives.<ref name=RAF>{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/peenemunde.html|title=Peenemunde, 17th and 18th August 1943|work=RAF History - Bomber Command|accessdate=2006-11-15|publisher=Royal Air Force}}</ref> The facility was salvaged and most of the science team remained unharmed, however the raids killed von Braun's engine designer [[Walter Thiel]] and Chief Engineer Walther, and the rocket program was delayed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Middlebrook|first=Martin|authorlink=|title=The Peenem<U+00FC>nde Raid: The Night of 17-18 August 1943|year=1982|publisher=Bobs-Merrill|location=New York|pages=222}}</ref><ref name=Dornberger>{{cite book |last=Dornberger|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Dornberger|title=V2--Der Schuss ins Weltall|year=1952 -- US translation  ''V-2'' Viking Press:New York, 1954|publisher=Bechtle Verlag|location=Esslingan|pages=164}}</ref>
{{seealso|Bombing of Peenem<U+00FC>nde in World War II}}

The first combat A-4, renamed the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] (''Vergeltungswaffe 2'' "Retaliation/Vengeance Weapon 2") for propaganda purposes, was launched toward [[England]] on [[September 7]] [[1944]], only 21 months after the project had been officially commissioned. Von Braun's interest in rockets was specifically for the application of space travel, which led him to say on hearing the news from London: 'The rocket worked perfectly except for landing on the wrong planet'. He described it as his 'darkest day'.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

====Slave labor====
SS General [[Hans Kammler]], who as an [[engineer]] had constructed several [[concentration camp]]s including [[Auschwitz]], had a reputation for brutality and had originated the idea of using concentration camp prisoners as [[Slavery|slave]] laborers in the rocket program. [[Arthur Rudolph]], chief engineer of the V-2 rocket factory at Peenem<U+00FC>nde, endorsed this idea in April 1943 when a labor shortage developed. More people died building the V-2 rockets than were killed by it as a weapon.<ref>Regarding V-2 slave labor, see, for example, [http://www.v2rocket.com/start/chapters/mittel.html Mittelbau Overview]</ref> Von Braun admitted visiting the plant at [[Mittelwerk]] on many occasions, and called conditions at the plant "repulsive", but claimed never to have witnessed firsthand any deaths or beatings, although it became clear to him that deaths had occurred by 1944 [http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/excerpts.html]. He denied ever visiting the [[Mittelbau-Dora]] concentration camp itself.

Adam Cabala reported (Ref 3):

<blockquote>[...] the German scientists led by Prof. Wernher von Braun also saw everything that went on every day. When they walked along the corridors, they saw the prisoners' drudgery, their exhausting work and their ordeal. During his frequent attendance in Dora, Prof. Wernher von Braun never once protested against this cruelty and brutality.</blockquote>

<blockquote>and</blockquote>

<blockquote>On a little area beside the clinic shack you could see piles of prisoners every day who had not survived the workload and had been tortured to death by the vindictive guards. [...] But Prof. Wernher von Braun just walked past them, so close that he almost touched the bodies.</blockquote>

On [[August 15]] [[1944]], von Braun wrote a letter (Ref 2) to Albin Sawatzki, manager of the V-2 production, admitting that he personally picked labor slaves from the [[Buchenwald]] concentration camp, who, he admitted 25 years later in an interview, had been in a "pitiful shape".

In ''Wernher von Braun: Crusader for Space'' numerous quotes from von Braun show he was aware of the conditions, but felt completely unable to change them. From a visit to Mittelwerk, von Braun is quoted by a friend: 

<blockquote>It is hellish. My spontaneous reaction was to talk to one of the SS guards, only to be told with unmistakable harshness that I should mind my own business, or find myself in the same striped fatigues!... I realized that any attempt of reasoning on humane grounds would be utterly futile. (Page 44)</blockquote>

====Arrest by the Nazi regime====
According to [[Andr<U+00E9> Sellier]], a French historian and survivor of the [[Mittelbau-Dora]] concentration camp, Himmler had von Braun come to his [[Hochwald]] HQ in [[East Prussia]] sometime in February 1944. To increase his power-base within the Nazi r<U+00E9>gime, Heinrich Himmler was conspiring to use Kammler to wrest control of all German armament programs, including the V-2 program at Peenem<U+00FC>nde. He therefore recommended that von Braun work more closely with Kammler to solve the problems of the V-2, but von Braun claimed to have replied that the problems were merely technical and he was confident that they would be solved with Dornberger's assistance. 

Apparently von Braun had been under [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] surveillance since October 1943. A report stated that he and his colleagues [[Klaus Riedel|Riedel]] and [[Helmut Gr<U+00F6>ttrup|Gr<U+00F6>ttrup]] were said to have expressed regret at an engineer's house one evening that they were not working on a spaceship and that they felt the war was not going well; this was considered a "defeatist" attitude. A young female dentist had denounced them for their comments. Combined with Himmler's false charges that von Braun was a [[Communism|Communist]] sympathizer and had attempted to sabotage the V-2 program, and considering that von Braun was a qualified pilot who regularly piloted his government-provided airplane that might allow him to escape to England, this led to his arrest by the [[Gestapo]]. Kammler, highly dedicated to Himmler, is thought to have been instrumental in these activities.

The unsuspecting von Braun was detained on [[March 14]] (or [[March 15]]), [http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/highlights.html] [[1944]] and was taken to a Gestapo cell in [[Szczecin|Stettin]] (now Szczecin, Poland), where he was imprisoned for two weeks without even knowing the charges against him. It was only through the [[Abwehr]] in Berlin that Dornberger was able to obtain von Braun's conditional release and [[Albert Speer]], Reichsminister for Munitions and War Production, convinced Hitler to reinstate von Braun so that the V-2 program could continue. Citing from the "F<U+00FC>hrerprotokoll" (the minutes of Hitler's meetings) dated [[May 13]], [[1944]] in his memoirs, Speer later relayed what Hitler had finally conceded: "In the matter concerning B. I will guarantee you that he will be exempt from persecution as long as he is indispensable for you, in spite of the difficult general consequences this will have." Nevertheless, from this point onward fear ruled in Peenem<U+00FC>nde.

===Surrender to the Americans===
[[Image:Dornberger-Axter-von Braun.jpg|left|thumb|Von Braun (with armcast) immediately after his surrender]]
The [[Soviet Army]] was about 160 km from [[Peenem<U+00FC>nde]] in the spring of 1945 when von Braun assembled his planning staff and asked them to decide how and to whom they should surrender. Afraid of Soviet cruelty to prisoners of war, von Braun and his staff decided to try to surrender to the Americans. Kammler had ordered relocation of von Braun's team into central Germany; however, a conflicting order from an army chief ordered them to join the army and fight. Deciding that Kammler's order was their best bet to defect to the Americans, von Braun fabricated documents and transported 500 of his affiliates to the area around Mittelwerk, where they resumed their work. For fear of their documents being destroyed by the SS, von Braun ordered the blueprints to be hidden in an abandoned mine shaft in the [[Harz]] mountain range. <ref name="Cadbury">{{cite book|last=Cadbury|first=Deborah|authorlink=Deborah Cadbury|title="Space Race"|year=2005|publisher=[[BBC Worldwide Limited]]|isbn=0-00-721299-2}}</ref>

While on an official trip in March, von Braun received a complicated fracture of his left arm and shoulder when his driver fell asleep at the wheel. His injuries were serious but he insisted that his arm be set in a cast so he could leave the hospital. Due to this neglect of the injury he had to be hospitalized again a month later where his bones had to be re-broken and re-aligned.<ref name="Cadbury"/>

In April, as the allied forces advanced deeper into Germany, Kammler ordered the science team to be moved by train into the town [[Oberammergau]] in the [[Bavarian Alps]] where they were closely guarded by the SS with orders to execute the team if they were about to fall into enemy hands. However, von Braun managed to convince the SS Major Kummer to order the dispersion of the group into nearby villages so that they would not be an easy target for U.S. bombers.<ref name="Cadbury"/>

On [[May 2]], [[1945]], upon finding an American private from the U.S. [[44th Infantry Division]], von Braun's brother and fellow rocket engineer, Magnus, approached the soldier on a bicycle, calling out in broken English, "My name is Magnus von Braun.  My brother invented the V-2.  We want to surrender."<ref>McDougall, Walter A.  ''...The Heavens and the Earth: A Political History of the Space Age''.  Basic Books: New York, 1985.  (p 44)  ISBN 0-465-02887-X</ref>

The American high command was well aware of how important their catch was: von Braun had been at the top of ''the Black List'', the code name for the list of German scientists and engineers targeted for immediate interrogation by U.S. military experts. On June 19, 1945, two days before the scheduled turnover of the area to the Soviets, US Army Major Robert B. Staver, Chief of the Jet Propulsion Section of the Research and Intelligence Branch of the US Army Ordnance in London, and Lt Col R. L. Williams took von Braun and his department chiefs by jeep from Garmisch to Munich. The group was flown to [[Nordhausen]], and was evacuated 40 miles Southwest to [[Witzenhausen]], a small town in the [[American Zone]], the next day.<ref name=McGovern>{{cite book |last=McGovern|first=J|title=Crossbow and Overcast|year=1964|publisher=W. Morrow|location=New York|pages=p182}}</ref>  von Braun was subsequently recruited to the US under [[Operation Paperclip|Operation Overcast]].

===American career===
====U.S. Army career====
On [[June 20]] [[1945]], [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Cordell Hull]] approved the transfer of von Braun and his specialists to America; however this was not announced to the public until [[October 1]], [[1945]] [http://www.v2rocket.com/start/chapters/paperclip.gif]. Since the paperwork of those Germans selected for transfer to the United States was indicated by paperclips, the transfer of von Braun and his colleagues became known as [[Operation Paperclip]], an operation that resulted in the employment of many German scientists by the U.S. Army.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

The first seven technicians arrived in the United States at [[New Castle Army Air Field]], just south of [[Wilmington, Delaware]], on [[September 20]] [[1945]]. They were then flown to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and taken by boat to the [[Army Intelligence]] Service post at [[Fort Strong]] in Boston Harbor. Later, with the exception of von Braun, the men were transferred to [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] in [[Maryland]] to sort out the Peenem<U+00FC>nde documents. These would enable the scientists to continue their rocketry experiments. 

Finally, von Braun and his remaining Peenem<U+00FC>nde staff (see [[List of German rocket scientists in the United States]]) were transferred to their new home at [[Fort Bliss, Texas]], a large Army installation just north of [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]]. While there, they trained military, industrial and university personnel in the intricacies of rockets and guided missiles. As part of the [[Hermes project]] they helped to refurbish, assemble and launch a number of V-2s that had been shipped from Germany to the [[White Sands Proving Grounds]] in [[New Mexico]]. They also continued to study the future potential of rockets for military and research applications. Since they were not permitted to leave Fort Bliss without military escort, von Braun and his colleagues began to refer to themselves only half-jokingly as "PoPs", "Prisoners of Peace".

[[Image:VonBraunMaria.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A portrait of Maria von Braun, wife of Wernher von Braun.]]
During his stay at Fort Bliss, von Braun mailed a marriage proposal to 18-year-old [[Maria Luise von Quistorp]], his cousin on his mother's side. On [[March 1]] [[1947]], having received permission to go back to Germany and return with his bride, he married her in a Lutheran church in [[Landshut]], Germany. He and his bride and his father and mother returned to New York on 26 March 1947. On 9 December 1948, the von Brauns' first daughter, Iris Careen, was born at Fort Bliss Army Hospital. The von Brauns eventually had two more children, Margrit C<U+00E9>cile on 8 May 1952 and Peter Constantine on 2 June 1960. On [[April 15]], [[1955]], von Braun became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States.

In 1950, at the start of the [[Korean War]], von Braun and his team were transferred to [[Huntsville, Alabama]], his home for the next twenty years. Between 1950 and 1956, von Braun led the Army's rocket development team at [[Redstone Arsenal]], resulting in the [[Redstone (rocket)|Redstone rocket]], which was used for the first live [[ballistic missile| nuclear ballistic missile]] tests conducted by the United States.

As Director of the Development Operations Division of the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] (ABMA), von Braun, with his team, then developed the [[Jupiter-C]], a modified Redstone rocket. The Jupiter-C successfully launched the West's first satellite, [[Explorer 1]], on [[January 31]] [[1958]]. This event signaled the birth of America's space program.

Despite the work on the Redstone rocket, the twelve years from 1945 to 1957 were probably some of the most frustrating for von Braun and his colleagues. In the Soviet Union, [[Sergei Korolev]] and his team of scientists and engineers plowed ahead with several new rocket designs and the [[Sputnik]] program, while the American government was not very interested in von Braun's work or views and only embarked on a very modest rocket-building program. In the meantime, the press tended to dwell on von Braun's past as a member of the SS and the [[slave labor]] used to build his V-2 rockets.

====Popular concepts for a human presence in space====
Repeating the pattern he had established during his earlier career in Germany, von Braun - while directing military rocket development in the real world - continued to entertain his engineer-scientist's dream of a future world in which rockets would be used for [[space exploration]]. However, instead of risking being sacked, he now was increasingly in a position to popularize these ideas. The [[May 14]], [[1950]] headline of ''[[The Huntsville Times]]'' (''"Dr. von Braun Says Rocket Flights Possible to Moon"'') might have marked the beginning of these efforts. In [[1952]], von Braun first published his concept of a manned [[space station]] in a ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' magazine series of articles entitled ''[[Man Will Conquer Space Soon!]]'' These articles were illustrated by the space artist [[Chesley Bonestell]] and were influential in spreading his ideas. Frequently von Braun worked with fellow German-born space advocate and science writer [[Willy Ley]] to publish his concepts which, unsurprisingly, were heavy on the engineering side and anticipated many technical aspects of space flight that later became reality.

The space station (to be constructed using rockets with recoverable and reusable ascent stages) would be a [[Stanford torus|toroid]] structure, with a diameter of 250 feet (76 m), would spin around a central docking nave to provide [[artificial gravity]], and would be assembled in a 1,075 miles (1,730 km) two-hour, high-inclination [[Earth orbit]] allowing observation of essentially every point on earth on at least a daily basis. (More than a decade later, the movie version of [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|''2001: A Space Odyssey'']] would draw heavily on this design concept in its visualization of the orbital space station.) The ultimate purpose of the space station would be to provide an assembly platform for manned [[Moon|lunar]] expeditions.

Von Braun envisaged these expeditions as very large-scale undertakings, with a total of 50 astronauts travelling in three huge spacecraft (two for crew, one primarily for cargo), each 49 m long and 33 m in diameter and driven by a rectangular array of 30 jet propulsion engines [http://www1.jsc.nasa.gov/er/seh/lunarlan.html]. Upon arrival, astronauts would establish a [[Colonization of the Moon|permanent lunar base]] in the [[Sinus Roris]] region by using the emptied cargo holds of their craft as shelters, and would explore their surroundings for eight weeks. This would include a 400 km expedition in pressurized rovers to the [[Harpalus (crater)|Harpalus]] crater and the [[Mare Imbrium]] foothills.

[[Image:Wernher von Braun(2).jpg|thumb|right|210px|[[Walt Disney]] and Wernher von Braun, shown in this 1954 photo holding a model of his passenger ship, collaborated on a series of three educational films.]]
At this time von Braun also worked out preliminary concepts for a manned [[Mars]] mission which used the space station as a staging point. His initial plans, published in ''The Mars Project'' ([[1952]]), had envisaged a fleet of ten spacecraft (each with a mass of 3,720 metric tons), three of them unmanned and each carrying one 200-ton winged lander [http://www1.jsc.nasa.gov/er/seh/vonlift.html] in addition to cargo, and nine crew vehicles transporting a total of 70 astronauts. Gigantic as this mission plan was, its engineering and astronautical parameters were thoroughly calculated. A later project was much more modest, using only one purely orbital cargo ship and one crewed craft. In each case, the expedition would use minimum-energy [[Hohmann transfer orbit]]s for its trips to Mars and back to Earth.

Before technically formalizing his thoughts on human spaceflight to Mars, von Braun had written a science fiction novel, set in 1980, on the subject. According to his biographer Erik Bergaust (see reference list), the manuscript was rejected by no less than 18 publishers. Von Braun later published small portions of this opus in magazines to illustrate selected aspects of his Mars project popularizations. Only in December 2006 did the complete manuscript appear in print as a book<ref>von Braun, Wernher: Project MARS: A Technical Tale. ISBN-10: 0973820330 , ISBN-13: 978-0973820331)</ref>

In the hope that its involvement would bring about greater public interest in the future of the space program, von Braun also began working with [[Walt Disney]] and  the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney studios]] as a [[technical director]], initially for three television films about space exploration. The initial broadcast devoted to space exploration was ''[[Man in Space]]'', which first went on air on [[March 9]], [[1955]].

====Concepts for orbital warfare====
Von Braun developed and published his space station concept during the very "coldest" time of the [[Cold War]], when the U.S. government for which he worked put the containment of the Soviet Union above everything else. The fact that his space station - if armed with missiles that could be easily adapted from those already available at this time - would give the United States space superiority in both orbital and [[Orbital bombardment|orbit-to-ground]] warfare did not escape him. Although von Braun took care to qualify such military applications as "particularly dreadful" in his popular writings, he elaborated on them in several of his books and articles. This much less peaceful aspect of von Braun's "drive for space" has recently been reviewed by Michael J. Neufeld from the Space History Division of the [[National Air and Space Museum]] in Washington<ref>Neufeld MJ: "Space superiority": Wernher von Braun's campaign for a nuclear-armed space station, 1946<U+2013>1956.

====NASA career====
[[Image:Kennedy vonbraun 19may63 02.jpg|left|thumb|Wernher von Braun walking with [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] at [[Redstone Arsenal]] in 1963.]]

The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] had been tasked with building a rocket to lift satellites into orbit, but the resulting [[Vanguard rocket]] launch system was unreliable. In 1957, with the launch of [[Sputnik 1]], there was a growing perception within the United States that America lagged behind the Soviet Union in the emerging [[Space Race]]. American authorities then chose to utilize von Braun and his German team's experience with missiles to create an orbital launch vehicle. 

[[Image:S-IC engines and Von Braun.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Wernher von Braun, with the [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1]] engines of the [[Saturn V]] first stage at the [[US Space and Rocket Center]].]]
NASA was established by law on [[July 29]] [[1958]]. One day later, the 50th Redstone rocket was successfully launched from [[Johnston Atoll]] in the south Pacific as part of [[Operation Hardtack]]. Two years later, NASA opened the new [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] at Redstone Arsenal in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], and the ABMA development team led by von Braun was transferred to NASA. In a face-to-face meeting with [[Herb York]] at the Pentagon, von Braun made it clear he would go to NASA only if development of the Saturn was allowed to continue.<ref>
{{cite web | url = http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/ch2.htm | title = Stages to Saturn - The Saturn Building Blocks - THE ABMA TRANSFER | publisher = NASA}}</ref> Presiding from July 1960 to February 1970, von Braun became the center's first Director.

The Marshall Center's first major program was the development of [[Saturn rocket]]s to carry heavy [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]]s into and beyond [[Earth orbit]]. From this, the [[Apollo program]] for manned moon flights was developed. Wernher von Braun initially pushed for a flight engineering concept that called for an [[Earth orbit rendezvous]] technique (the approach he had argued for building his space station), but in [[1962]] he converted to the more risky [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] concept that was subsequently realized[http://history.nasa.gov/Apollomon/apollo6.pdf]. His dream to help mankind set foot on the [[Moon]] became a reality on [[July 16]] [[1969]] when a Marshall-developed [[Saturn V]] rocket launched the crew of ''[[Apollo 11]]'' on its historic eight-day mission. Over the course of the program, Saturn V rockets enabled six teams of astronauts to reach the surface of the Moon.

[[Image:19700202-wernher-von-braun-nasa.jpg|left|thumb|Still with his rocket models, von Braun is pictured in his new office at NASA headquarters in 1970.]]
During the late 1960s, von Braun played an instrumental role in the development of the [[U.S. Space & Rocket Center]] in Huntsville. The desk from which he guided America's entry in the Space Race remains on display there.

During the local summer of 1966/67, von Braun participated in a field trip to [[Antarctica]], organized for him and several other members of top NASA management<ref>Space Man's Look at Antarctica. Popular Science, Vol. 190, No. 5, May 1967, pp. 114-116. [http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/photo/13.html (Photo of von Braun at South Pole])</ref>. The goal of the field trip was to determine whether the experience gained by US scientific and technological community during the exploration of Antarctic wastelands would be useful for the manned exploration of space. Von Braun was mainly interested in management of the scientific effort on Antarctic research stations, logistics, habitation and life support, and in using the barren Antarctic terrain like the glacial dry valleys to test the equipment that one day would be used to look for signs of life on Mars and other worlds.

In an [http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/announcement_4.pdf internal memo dated January 16, 1969] von Braun had confirmed to his staff that he would stay on as a Center Director at Huntsville to head the [[Apollo Applications Program]]. A few months later, on occasion of the first moon-landing, he publicly expressed his optimism that the [[Saturn V]] carrier system would continue to be developed, advocating manned missions to [[Mars]] in the 1980s <ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Next, Mars and Beyond |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901107,00.html |quote=Even as man prepared to take his first tentative extraterrestrial steps, other celestial adventures beckoned him. The shape and scope of the post-Apollo manned space program remained hazy, and a great deal depends on the safe and successful outcome of [[Apollo 11]]. But well before the moon flight was launched, [[NASA]] was casting eyes on targets far beyond the moon. The most inviting: the earth's close, and probably most hospitable, planetary neighbor. Given the same energy and dedication that took them to the moon, says Wernher von Braun, Americans could land on Mars as early as 1982. |publisher=[[Time (magazine)]] |date=[[July 25]], [[1969]] |accessdate=2007-06-21 }}</ref>

However, on [[March 1]], [[1970]], von Braun and his family relocated to [[Washington, D.C.]], when he was assigned the post of NASA's Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning at NASA Headquarters. After a series of conflicts associated with the truncation of the Apollo program, and facing severe budget constraints, von Braun retired from NASA on [[May 26]], [[1972]]. Not only had it became evident by this time that his and NASA's visions for future U.S. space flight projects were incompatible; it was perhaps even more frustrating for him to see popular support for a continued presence of man in space wane dramatically once the goal to reach the moon had been accomplished.

====Career after NASA====

[[Image:Von Braun Wernher grave.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Wernher von Braun in Ivy Hill Cemetery (Alexandria, Virginia)]]
After leaving NASA, von Braun became Vice President for Engineering and Development at the aerospace company, [[Fairchild (aircraft manufacturer)|Fairchild Industries]] in [[Germantown, Maryland]] on [[July 1]], [[1972]].

In [[1973]] a routine health check uncovered [[Renal cell carcinoma|kidney cancer]] which during the following years could not be controlled by surgery<ref>German sources mostly specify the cancer as renal, while American biographies unanimously just mention cancer. The time when von Braun learned about the disease is generally given as between 1973 and 1976. The characteristics of renal cell carcinoma, which has a bad prognosis even today, do not rule out either time limit.</ref>. Von Braun continued his work to the degree possible, which included accepting invitations to speak at colleges and universities as he was eager to cultivate interest in human spaceflight and rocketry, particularly with students and a new generation of engineers. On one such visit in the spring of 1974 to [[Allegheny College]], von Braun revealed a more personal, down-to-earth side of himself as a man in his early 60s, beyond the public persona most saw, including an all-too-human allergy to feather pillows and a subtle, if not humorous disdain for some rock music of the era.

Von Braun helped establish and promote the [[National Space Institute]], a precursor of the present-day [[National Space Society]], in [[1975]], and became its first president and chairman. In [[1976]], he became scientific consultant to [[Lutz Kayser]], the CEO of [[OTRAG]], and a member of the [[Daimler-Benz]] board of directors. However, his deteriorating condition forced him to retire from Fairchild on [[December 31]] [[1976]]. When the [[1975]] [[National Medal of Science]] was awarded to him in early [[1977]] he was hospitalized, and unable to attend the White House ceremony. On [[June 16]] [[1977]], Wernher von Braun died in [[Alexandria, Virginia]] at the age of 65. He was buried at the [[Ivy Hill Cemetery]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. <ref>[http://www.ivyhill.org/ Ivy Hill Cemetery]</ref> <ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Wernher von Braun, Rocket Pioneer, Dies; Wernher von Braun, Pioneer in Space Travel and Rocketry, Dies at 65 |url= |quote=Wernher von Braun, the master rocket builder and pioneer of space travel, died of cancer Thursday morning.

* [[National Medal of Science]] in [[1975]]
* [[Werner-von-Siemens-Ring]] in [[1975]]

== Posthumous recognition and critique==
* [[Apollo space program]] director Sam Phillips was quoted as saying that he did not think that America would have reached the moon as quickly as it did without von Braun's help. Later, after discussing it with colleagues, he amended this to say that he did not believe America would have reached the moon at all.<!-- interview January 19th, 2006 Alan Lawrie on The Space Show author of 'Saturn', presumably in his book as well --->
* The [[von Braun (crater)|von Braun crater]] on the moon was so named by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] in recognition of von Braun's contribution to space exploration and technology.
* Von Braun received a total of 12 honorary doctorates, among them (on [[January 8]], [[1963]]) one from the [[Technical University of Berlin]] from which he had graduated.
*Von Braun was responsible for the creation of the Research Institute at The University of Alabama in Huntsville. As a result of his vision, the university is one of the leading universities in the nation for NASA-sponsored research. The building housing the university's Research Institute was named in his honor, Von Braun Research Hall, in 2000.
* Several German cities ([[Bonn]], [[Neu-Isenburg]], [[Mannheim]], [[Mainz]]), and dozens of smaller towns, have named streets after Wernher von Braun. Remarkably, all these places are situated in Germany's Southwest and South - the American and French parts of the Allied [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|occupation zones]]. There seem to be no von Braun streets in the northern parts of the former Federal Republic of Germany, which were occupied by the British. Having had London suffer from his rockets, it is quite understandable that the United Kingdom would have discouraged German attempts at honoring von Braun.
* The [[Von Braun Center]] (built 1975) in [[Huntsville, Alabama]] is named in von Braun's honor.
* Scrutiny of von Braun's use of forced labor at the ''Mittelwerk'' intensified again in [[1984]] when [[Arthur Rudolph]], one of his top affiliates from the A-4/V2 through to the Apollo projects, left the United States and was forced to renounce his citizenship in front of the alternative of being tried for war crimes.<ref>William E., Sr. Winterstein Secrets Of The Space Age: The Sacrifices and Struggles To Get To The Moon; The Aftermath: What Happened After Lunar Mission, Intrigue and United States Space Heroes Betrayed (Hardcover) Robert D. Reed Publishers June 30, 2005 ISBN 1931741492 </ref>
* A science- and engineering-oriented ''Gymnasium'' (the approximate equivalent of a high school) in [[Friedberg, Bavaria]] was named after Wernher von Braun in [[1979]]. In response to rising criticism, a school committee decided in [[1995]], after lengthy deliberations, to keep the name but "''to address von Braun's ambiguity in the advanced history classes''."

== Cultural references ==
===On film and television===
Wernher von Braun has been featured in a number of movies and television shows or series about the [[Space Race]]:
* ''[[I Aim at the Stars]]'' (1960), also titled ''Wernher von Braun'' and ''Ich greife nach den Sternen'' ("I reach for the stars"): von Braun played by [[Curd J<U+00FC>rgens]]). Satirist [[Mort Sahl]] suggested the subtitle "(But Sometimes I Hit London)".
* ''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' (1964): Dr Strangelove is usually held to be based at least partly on von Braun.
* ''[[Mababangong Bangungot (Perfumed Nightmare)]]'' (1977): Director and star [[Kidlat Tahimik]] is president of a Wernher von Braun club and is fascinated with "First World" progress, particularly von Braun's efforts in the U.S. space program.
* ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' (1979): The largest Lunar city in the Universal Century era is called 'Von Braun City'. The city is the home of Anaheim Electronics, is a strategic point in space, and is built around Neil Armstrong's footprint in the Apollo missions.
* ''[[The Right Stuff]]'' (1983): The Chief Scientist, played by [[Scott Beach]], was clearly modeled on von Braun.
* ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990): Emmett "Doc" Brown reveals that when his Family emigrated to the US, they were originally called "von Braun".
* ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (HBO)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' (TV, 1998): von Braun played by [[Norbert Weisser]].
* ''[[October Sky]]'' (1999): In this film about American rocket scientist [[Homer Hickam]], who as a teenager admired von Braun, the scientist is played by [[Joe Digaetano]].
* ''[[Space Race (TV)|Space Race]]'' (TV, [[BBC]] co-production with [[NDR]] (Germany), Channel One TV (Russia) and [[National Geographic]] TV (USA), 2005): von Braun played by [[Richard Dillane]].
*  ''[[Alphaville, une <U+00E9>trange aventure de Lemmy Caution]]'' (1965, directed by [[Jean-Luc Godard]]): [[Howard Vernon]] plays Professor Von Braun (also known as Leonard Nosferatu), the inventor of the "Alpha 60" super-computer which rules Alphaville.
* "Race to Space" (2001) James Woods portrays a character that the film's director states was "clearly modeled" after von Braun, working on the Mercury program sending the first chimp "Ham" (renamed Mac) into space.
* ''[[Planetes]]'' (2003): The ''von Braun'' is the ship built to make the first manned voyage to the Jovian system.  Additionally, the character Wernher Locksmith, the director of the mission, is possibly based on von Braun.
* ''[[Alien Planet]]'' (TV, 2005): A spacecraft, named ''[[VonBraun (Alien Planet)|VonBraun]]'', is named after him.

===In print media===
*In an issue of ''Mad Magazine'' in the late 1950s, artist [[Wallace Wood]] depicted von Braun at the launch of a rocket, ready to listen to a radio transmitting the rocket's signals. Suddenly he says, "HIMMEL! Vas ist los?" and then explains, "Vat iss wrong is vit der RADIO! It iss AC...und der control room iss DC!"

*In [[Warren Ellis]]' graphic novel ''[[Ministry of Space]]'', Von Braun is a supporting character, settling in Britain after WWII, and being essential for the realization of the British Space Program.

*In the [[Robotech]] comics by [[DC]]/[[Wildstorm]], Dr. [[Emil Lang]], said to be the chief pioneer of Earth based Robotechnology, has been compared favorably to Von Braun. Notably, Dr. Lang is also German.

===In novels===
*''[[The Good German]]'' by Joseph Kanon.  Von Braun and other scientists are said to have been implicated in the use of slave labour at Peenem<U+00FC>nde; their transfer to the US forms part of the narrative.

*''[[Space]]'' by James Michener. Von Braun and other German scientists are brought to the US and form a vital part of the US efforts to reach space. 

*''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' by Thomas Pynchon. The plot involves British intelligence attempting to avert and predict V-2 rocket attacks.  The work even includes a gyroscopic equation for the V2. The first portion of the novel, "Beyond The Zero," begins with a quote from Von Braun: "Nature does not know extinction; all it knows is transformation. Everything science has taught me, and continues to teach me, strengthens my belief in the continuity of our spiritual existence after death." 

*''New Dictionary'', a short story by Kurt Vonnegut in his collection ''[[Welcome to the Monkey House]]'' notes Von Braun as one of the things an old dictionary doesn't mention.

*''[[Mother Night]]'' by [[Kurt Vonnegut]] has a scene in which a character reads a ''Life'' magazine with Von Braun on the cover.

*''[[Seven Ancient Wonders]]'' by [[Matthew Reilly]]. The plot involves [[Nazi]]s such as [[Hans Koeing]] and also mentions Von Braun.

===In music===
* ''Wernher von Braun'' (1965): A song written and performed by [[Tom Lehrer]] for an episode of [[NBC]]'s American version of the BBC TV show ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]''; the song was later included in Lehrer's album ''[[That Was The Year That Was]]''. It was a satire on what some saw as von Braun's cavalier attitude toward the consequences of his work in Nazi Germany: "'Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down? / That's not my department', says Wernher von Braun."

* ''The Last Days of Pompeii'' (1991): A rock opera by [[Grant Hart]]'s post-[[H<U+00FC>sker D<U+00FC>]] alternative rock group [[Nova Mob]], in which von Braun features as a character. The album includes a song called ''Wernher von Braun''. 

* ''Progress vs. Pettiness'' (2005): A song about the Space Race written and performed by [[The Phenomenauts]] for their CD ''[[Re-Entry (CD)|Re-Entry]]''. The song begins: "In 1942 there was Wernher von Braun..."

*[[John D. Loudermilk]]'s song ''He's Just A Scientist (That's All)'' contains the lyric "Everybody's flippin' over Fabian or Frankie Avalon, but nobody ever seems to give a flip over Dr Werner Von Braun."

* The song "Apollo XI/V1/V2/Aggregat 4" from German Electro band ''[[Welle:Erdball]]'' deals with his inventions.

===In computer games===
* In the 1999 [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] game ''[[System Shock 2]]'', the main starship is named the ''[[Von Braun (starship)|Von Braun]]''.
* In the 2004 [[Playstation 2]] game ''[[Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater]]'', the character of [[List of Metal Gear Solid 3 characters#Sokolov|Nikolai Sokolov]] portrays many parallels to von Braun, including his CIA-aided defection to the United States, and famed contributions to rocket science. This may however, be a reference to [[Sergey Korolyov|Korolev]], considered by many to be the equivalent of Von Braun in the Soviet space project.
