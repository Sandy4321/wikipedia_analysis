'''''L<U+00E4>ngre in<U+00E5>t landet''''' is the fifth [[studio album]] by the [[Swedish people|Swedish]] rock artist [[Ulf Lundell]] and was released on September 12, 1980, through [[Parlophone]]. It was produced by Lasse Lindbom, Ulf Lundell and Kjell Andersson. The album has sold gold in Sweden. This was also Lundells first double album.

It was recorded at Ridge Farm in Surrey in southern England, and contains songs like "Stackars Jack" ("Poor Jack") and "Glad igen" ("Happy Again") who kept up with the live repertoire throughout the years. The latter is an interpretation of the [[Joni Mitchell]] song "Carey". On the LP release, track number 8 on the second disc is hidden. It is a recording of "Som en syster" ("Like a Sister") from the live album "Natten hade varit mild och <U+00F6>m" from 1977.

The album was reissued in 1999 in a remastered version with three extra tracks, one of which is an interpretation of Bob Dylan's song "Just like a woman."
