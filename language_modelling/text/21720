{{otherships|HMS Waterwitch}}

'''HMS ''Waterwitch''''' was one of only three armoured [[gunboat]]s built for the Royal Navy.  Uniquely she was powered by Ruthven's "hydraulic propeller", making her the first ship to employ waterjets.  She was launched in 1866 and conducted comparative trials with her two sister ships. She was not employed operationally and was sold in 1890.

==Design==
Designed by the Rear Admiral George Eliot and the Controller's Department,<ref name=RW/> ''Waterwitch'' was a half-sister to {{HMS|Vixen|1865|2}} and {{HMS|Viper|1865|2}}, and all three were built mostly as experimental vessels.  While ''Viper'' and ''Vixen'' were twin screw vessels, ''Waterwitch'' had a water-pump propulsion system.  ''Vixen'' was almost identical to ''Viper'', but was of composite construction.<ref name=RW/>

===Hull===
''Waterwitch'' was an armoured gunboat of the breastwork type, with a hull constructed of iron.<ref name=RW/> Her {{convert|4+1/2|in|cm|adj=on}} armour plating was backed by {{convert|10|in|cm}} of teak and extended for about {{convert|60|ft|m}} amidships.  
[[File:HMS Waterwitch (1866) cut away.jpg|thumb|left|A contemporary cut-away diagram of ''Waterwitch'']]The bottom of the armoured box extended {{convert|3|to|4|ft|m|1}} below the waterline and up to the upperdeck.  The forward and aft ends of the box were similarly armoured, although the front end also extended upwards by a further {{convert|5|ft|6|in|m|1}}.<ref name=JOF/> In addition, a waterline armoured belt extended for the whole length of the vessel. She and her two sisters were the only armoured gunboats ever built for the Royal Navy. Unlike her sisters, she was fitted with a bow rudder as well as the traditional stern rudder.<ref name=RW/>

===Sail plan===
She was equipped with a [[barquentine]] rig.<ref name=RW/>

===Armament===
''Waterwitch'' was armed with two [[RML 7 inch gun|7-inch (6<U+00BD>-ton) muzzle-loading rifled guns]] and two [[RBL 20 pounder Armstrong gun|20-pounder breech-loading]] rifled guns.<ref name=RW/>  

===Propulsion===
''Waterwitch''{{'}}s unique propulsion system was essentially a vast centrifugal steam-powered pump which drew water from sluices in the centre of the vessel and ejected it in jets from adjustable nozzles.<ref name=COA/> Two sets of nozzles were provided, one for ahead propulsion and one for astern propulsion.<ref name=JOF>[http://books.google.com/books?id=kKIqAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA396&lpg=PA396&dq=hms+water+wtich&source=bl&ots=OrAa9Jy2Ma&sig=VTZg7W68fG8m6NeWD40_rXAVh_I&hl=en&ei=Ta06TMWvLMyAnweR6fjUBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=true Journal of the Franklin Institute By Persifor Frazer, Franklin Institute, Philadelphia (1866)] p.396</ref> Steam was provided by two Maudslay iron fire-tube boilers fed from six furnaces.  The horizontal Ruthven "hydraulic reaction engine" was manufactured by J & W Dudgeon and comprised a wheel {{convert|14|ft|6|in|m|1}} in diameter weighing {{convert|8|LT|kg}} and contained within a case {{convert|19|ft|m}} across.<ref name=COA>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofart.net/bship/hms_water-witch.html|title=H.M.S. ''Waterwitch'' Experimental Jet-Propelled Ironclad Gunboat (1866)|accessdate=2011-06-06}}</ref>  The wheel was rotated by three steam cylinders and developed {{convert|780|ihp|lk=on}}.<ref name=RW/> The hopes of safety, performance and control that were expected from this propulsion were summed up by Mr M W Ruthven:

{{cquote|My efforts to make a ship safe, from an engineer's point of view, lie in the method of propulsion. My plans are to apply all the engine-power of the ship to pumps for propulsion, and which can be used for pumping out leakage and propelling at the same time. In the largest pump I have made, 800 indicated horsepower discharged 350 tons of water a minute, and propelled the vessel faster than her sister ships with twin screws. The hydraulic propeller is of greatest value for the highest speeds, and has the greatest power of control. As the hydraulic is capable of subdivision to a great degree, the greatest amount of safety is possible. After an experience of sixty years of hydraulic propulsion, I am still of opinion that it is the means by which greater safety can be obtained at sea, and by which the highest speeds can be obtained with safety and economy|20px|20px|Mr M W Ruthven, son of the inventor<ref name=COA/>}}

==Construction==
''Waterwitch'' was ordered from the [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company]] on 29 October 1864<ref name=RW/> and laid down the same year.  She was launched on 28 June 1866 and commissioned on 26 June 1867 under Commander Philip Ruffle Sharpe<ref name=WL>{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/ShowShip.php?id=2285 |title=HMS ''Waterwitch'' at William Looney website|accessdate=2008-09-23}}</ref> for comparative trials.<ref name=RW/>

==Career==
[[File:HMS Waterwitch (1866) moored.jpg|thumb|right|''Waterwitch'' moored between buoys]]
''Vixen'', ''Viper'' and ''Waterwitch'' conducted comparative trials at [[Stokes Bay]] in the [[Solent]] the late 1860s.  Although turning ability was impressive, and ''Waterwitch'' most impressive of all in this respect, none of the ships attained more than {{convert|9.5|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} in an era when {{HMS|Warrior|1860|2}} could achieve {{convert|14.5|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Gould>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119360482/PDFSTART Richard A Gould, ''The archaeology of HMS'' Vixen'', an early ironclad ram in Bermuda'', The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology (1991) 20.2: 141-153] (Subscription required)</ref> She was inspected by the American admiral commanding the [[European Squadron]], Admiral [[David Farragut]] in 1867.<ref name=NYT/>

None of the armoured gunboats performed well in the trials because of their inefficient hull form.  ''Waterwitch'' was no worse than ''Viper'' or ''Vixen'' in the speed trials and manoeuvred impressively.  Nevertheless, a huge internal volume was required for the internal "hydraulic propeller"<ref name=NYT>[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9E00E4DA1630EE34BC4B52DFB7668383679FDE The Hydraulic Propeller, A Description of this Novel Propelling Device, and an Account of its Performance,&nbsp;''[[New York Times]]'', 13 January 1868]</ref> and there was little in favour of this early form of [[jetboat]] over the then nearly ubiquitous screw propulsion.<ref name=NYT/>

She carried out [[inclining test]]s in [[Keyham, Devon|Keyham Basin]], Devonport on 16 March 1871.<ref name=PB>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/18-1900/W/05191.html|title=HMS ''Waterwitch'' at Naval Database website|accessdate=2008-09-23}}</ref> She seems to have spent much of the rest of her life as a test bed alongside in [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth]].<ref name=PB/><ref name=COA/>

==Fate==
Placed on the non-effective list long before disposal, she was sold to Castle for breaking at Charlton on 26 April 1890.<ref name=RW/>
