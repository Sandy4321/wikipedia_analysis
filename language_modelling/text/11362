==Biography==
The man that would grow up to wrestle as Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. was born on January 1, 1960 in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, son of legendary wrestler [[Rayo de Jalisco, Sr.]] and the nephew of wrestlers Tony Sugar and Black Sugar. Being born into a wrestling family it was inevitable that Rayo, Jr. would become a wrestler himself. He was not initially trained by his father as his father did not want his son to follow into his profession, instead he trained under [[Diablo Velazco]].<ref name="FigurasRayoJr"/>

===Professional wrestling career===
The future Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. turned professional at the age of 15 and initially wrestled under the name "Rayman" to keep his father from finding out he was wrestling. After working as a wrestler for a year he finally revealed to his father that he was wrestling and that he was serious. After seeing his son wrestle, Rayo, Sr. decided to allow his son to work as "Rayo de Jalisco, Jr." and wear the lightingbolt mask that was synonymous with the Rayo de Jalisco character.<ref name=MondoFamily>{{cite book | author= Madigan, Dan | title= Mondo Lucha Libre: the bizare & honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling | publisher= HarperColins Publisher | year= 2007 | chapter = A family affair | pages = 128<U+2013>132 | accessdate= July 16, 2009 | isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}</ref> Rayo, Jr. worked most of the 1970s alongside his father, receiving further training along the way. By the early 1980s Rayo, Jr. was working for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|Empressa Mexicana de Lucha Libre]] (EMLL), Mexico's largest [[professional wrestling promotion]]. By 1982 Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. began a wrestling storyline, called a feud, with [[MS-1 (wrestler)|MS-1]] that ended when Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. defeated MS-1 in a ''[[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Luchas de apuestas]]'', mask vs. mask match to unmask the hated [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] (called a ''Rudo'' in Lucha Libre).<ref name="EncyMS1">{{cite news | author = Enciclopedia staff | title = Enciclopedia de las Mascaras | work = MS-1 | location = [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]] | id = Tomo III | page = 42 | date = OCtober, 2007 | accessdate = July 19, 2009 | language = Spanish}}</ref> Through the early eighties Rayo, Jr. teamed up with equally popular [[Cien Caras]] to form a very successful team, working main events all over Mexico. On January 8, 1984 Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. captured his first singles championship as he defeated [[Pirata Morgan]] to win the [[Mexican National Heavyweight Championship]].<ref name=MexHeavy/> Rayo's first success also led to his greatest rivalry as Cien Caras turned on Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. in his quest to win the Mexican National Heavyweight Title. Cien Caras defeated his former teammate for the title on March 30, 1984 but that would not be the end of their rivalry.<ref name=MexHeavy/> On June 21, 1985 Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. defeated MS-1 to capture the [[NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship]] in the main event of an Arena Mexico show in [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]], EMLL's hometown.<ref name=NWALHeavy/> In November 1985 Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. teamed up with [[Ringo Mendoza]] and the Kiss to win the [[Mexican National Trios Championship]] from Los Brazos ([[El Brazo]], [[Brazo de Oro (wrestler)|Brazo de Oro]] and [[Jos<U+00E9> Alvarado Nieves|Brazo de Plata]]). The trio would hold the title for 275 days before losing it to Pirata Morgan, [[Jerry Estrada]] and Hombre Bala.<ref name=MexTrios/> On March 20, 1987 Rayo de Jalisco's 637 day reign as NWA World Light Heavyweight Champion ended as he lost to MS-1.<ref name=NWALHeavy/> By 1990 the storyline between Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. and Cien Caras became so heated that they were the main event of CMLL's 57th Anniversary show in a ''Luchas de Apuestas'', mask vs. mask match. Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. defeated Cien Caras two falls to one and forced Cien Caras to unmask.<ref name=CarasApuesta>{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.net/2009/09/17/recordando-los-aniversarios-del-cmll-el-rayo-de-jalisco-gana-la-mascara-de-cien-caras/#more-38299 | title= Recordando los aniversarios del CMLL: El Rayo de Jalisco gana la M<U+00E1>scara de Cien Caras | author= Ruiz Glez, Alex | date= September 17, 2009 | accessdate= September 18, 2009 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}</ref><ref name="EncyCaras">{{cite news | author = Enciclopedia staff | title = Enciclopedia de las Mascaras | work = Cien Caras | location = [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]] | id = Tomo I | page = 54 | date = July, 2007 | accessdate = July 19, 2009 | language = Spanish}}</ref>

Over the next couple of years Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. would hold the Mexican National Heavyweight Title twice more, defeating [[Gran Markus, Jr.]] and El Egipico to win the title. Rayo's third and final reign ended on February 21, 1994 when he lost to [[Pierroth, Jr.]].<ref name=MexHeavy/> On November 3, 1995 Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. teamed up with [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]] to win the [[CMLL World Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Headhunters (professional wrestling)|The Headhunters]].<ref name=CMLLTag/> The duo would successfully defend against [[M<U+00E1>scara A<U+00F1>o 2000]] and [[Universo 2000]], younger brother of eternal rival Cien Caras, an dalso against [[Apolo Dant<U+00E9>s]] and [[El Canek]]. On August 6, 1996 Gran Markus, Jr. and [[Arturo Beristain|El Hijo del Gladiador]] won the titles from Rayo & Atlantis.<ref name=CMLLTag/> On April 14, 1996 Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. reaches the top of CMLL as he wins the [[CMLL World Heavyweight Championship]] from Apolo Dant<U+00E9>s.<ref name=CMLLHeavy/> Rayo would make three successful defenses against the former champion Apolo Dant<U+00E9>s, as well as warting off the challenges of Gran Markus, Jr. and M<U+00E1>scara A<U+00F1>o 2000.<ref name=CMLLHeavyReigns>{{cite web | url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2009/1236925821.php | title=Viva La Raza! # Diecisiete: Lucha Weekly | author= Josh Boutwell | date= March 13, 2009 | accessdate= July 19, 2009 | publisher=WrestleView.com}}</ref> On April 18, 1997 Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. loses the title to [[Sean Morley|Steel]] after a slow building storyline between the two.<ref name=CMLLHeavy/> In 1997 Steel leaves CMLL to work for the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) as "Val Venis", ending the storyline with Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. without a satisfactory conclusion. CMLL convinced the WWF to let Steel return to CMLL for a brief visit, just long enough to lose a ''Luchas de Apuestas'' to Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. giving Rayo another mask win.<ref name="TomoSteel">{{cite news | author = Enciclopedia staff | title = Enciclopedia de las Mascaras | work = Steel | location = [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]] | id = Tomo IV | pages = 56 | date = October, 2007 | accessdate = July 19, 2009 | language = Spanish}}</ref> A few months after unmasking Steel Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. became a two time CMLL World Heavyweight Champion, defeating Universo 2000 for the belt.<ref name=CMLLHeavy/> Rayo defended against Cien Caras and Mascara A<U+00F1>o 200 before losing the title back to Universo 2000.<ref name=CMLLHeavy/><ref name=CMLLHeavyReigns/> The match with Universo 2000 cost him more than just the championship as a mistimed [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Tombstone piledriver|Tombstone piledriver]] ended up injuring Rayo de Jalisco, Jr's neck forcing him out of the ring for over six months and almost caused Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. to retire.<ref name="FigurasRayoJr"/>

In 2001 Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. dropped the "Junior" part of his name as his son, who had wrestled for two years, took the "Rayo de Jalisco" name, sometimes billed as ''el Hijo de Rayo de Jalisco, Jr.'' (the son of Rayo de Jalisco, Jr.) and other times simply ''Rayo de Jalisco, Jr.''. The confusing name changes only lasted for a couple of months before Rayo Jr's son changed his name to ''Hombre sin Nombre'' (the man without name) as part of a storyline where the son was trying to get out from Rayo de Jalisco, Jr's shadow. His son would later begin working as "Rayman", the same name that Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. originally used.<ref name=MondoFamily/> Since 2003 Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. has not worked for CMLL on a regular basis, instead he works for a number of [[Independent circuit]] Mexican promotions. On March 21, 2003 Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. won the [[WWA World Heavyweight Championship (Mexico)|WWA World Heavyweight Championship]], defeating [[Rey Misterio, Sr.]] in the finals of a tournamnet to crown a new champipn. Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. still holds that title to this day, {{age in days nts|month1=3|day1=21|year1=2003}} later.<ref name=WWAWorld/> In 2004 Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. made a brief return to CMLL teaming up with [[Black Warrior (wrestler)|Black Warrior]] and El Canek to win the [[CMLL World Trios Championship]] from [[Dr. Wagner, Jr.]], Universo 2000 and [[C<U+00E9>sar Cuauht<U+00E9>moc Gonz<U+00E1>lez|Black Tiger III]]. The team quickly lost the titles to [[H<U+00E9>ctor Garza]], [[Tarzan Boy (wrestler)|Tarzan Boy]] and [[El Terrible]].<ref name=CMLLTrios/> In 2005 Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. suffered another serious injury, he injured both his knees in a match against M<U+00E1>scara A<U+00F1>o 2000 where his legs got caught on the ropes as he jumped out of the ring and he tore ligaments in both knees. The injury kept him out of the ring for almost half a year but in the end Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. was able to make a full recovery and return to the ring.<ref name="FigurasRayoJr"/>

====Return to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre====
Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. made his return to CMLL in May, 2010, siding with the CMLL loyalists in their feud with ''[[Los Invasores]]'', especially ''Invasore'' members Universo 2000 and M<U+00E1>scara A<U+00F1>o 2000, reiginting the long running storyline between them.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2010/05/16/resultados-arena-mexico-16-mayo-2010-%c2%a1mr-aguila-es-parte-de-los-invasores-%c2%a1rayo-de-jalisco-jr-regreso-al-cmll/ | title= Resultados Arena M<U+00E9>xico (16 mayo 2010): <U+00A1>Mr. <U+00C1>guila es parte de los invasores! <U+00A1>Rayo de Jalisco Jr. regres<U+00F3> al CMLL! | author= Rostro Oculto | date= May 16, 2010 | accessdate= May 17, 2010 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language= Spanish}}</ref> During one of his first interviews back with CMLL he commented that it was strange to see his former friend and tag team partner [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]] as a ''[[Heel (professional wrestling)|rudo]]'' The seemingly unrelated comment slowly build into a storyline between the two former partners, initially facing off on opposite sides of trios matches. During the build of the match Atlantis has expressed an interest in challenging Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. for his [[WWA World Heavyweight Championship]], but also stated that it was too early to talk about a ''[[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Lucha de Apuesta]]'', mask vs. mask match, between the two as they had not even faced off in a one on one match yet.
