'''Discovery Passage''' is a channel that forms part of the [[Inside Passage]] between [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[Discovery Islands]] which lie off the [[British Columbia]] coast north of the [[Georgia Strait]].  Most of the eastern shoreline of the passage is [[Quadra Island]] with [[Sonora Island, British Columbia|Sonora Island]] forming the shoreline at the northern end where Discovery Passage meets [[Johnstone Strait]].  The southern end of Discovery Passage enters the [[Strait of Georgia]].  It is 25 km (44 miles) in length and is typically about 2 km (1.2 miles) in width, less at [[Seymour Narrows]] which lies in the lower half of Discovery Passage.

The passage is a significant shipping route as it is the preferred channel for vessels entering or leaving the Georgia Strait from the north.
