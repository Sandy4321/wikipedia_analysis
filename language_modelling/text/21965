'''Yate railway station''' serves the town of [[Yate]] in [[South Gloucestershire]], in south west [[England]]. The station is located on the main Bristol to Birmingham line between [[Bristol Parkway]] and [[Cam and Dursley railway station|Cam & Dursley]], and is operated by [[First Great Western]].

The station is staffed on weekday mornings.<ref>[http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/YAE.html National Rail Enquiries]</ref> It has two platforms, separated by the [[A432 road]] bridge.  An automated ticket machine was installed in mid-2007, but stopped functioning due to vandalism and is reported to be "unlikely to be replaced in the foreseeable future".<ref>[http://yateuser.blogspot.com/2010/02/ticket-machines.html Yate Station User Group]</ref>

The Yate station first opened on 8 July 1844 and closed in January 1965, along with other wayside stations on the former [[Bristol and Gloucester Railway]]; the local stopping service on the route having been withdrawn as a result of the [[Beeching Axe]].<ref>[http://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/sites/default/files/work-in-progress/yate_settlement_aug_2013.pdf The Victoria County History of Gloucestershire, Volume 14, Yate: Settlement (draft), p.10] Victoria County History.ac.uk; Retrieved 2013-12-13</ref><ref>[http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/BRB_Beech001a.pdf British Railways Board - The Reshaping of British Railways, Part 1 Report (HMSO) 1963, p.121]''The Railways Archive''; Retrieved 2013-12-13</ref>  This had both its platforms on the southern side of the road bridge mentioned above - the original 1844 goods shed still stands (now in commercial use) next to the old southbound platform site.<ref>[http://viewfinder.english-heritage.org.uk/search/reference.aspx?uid=59824&index=624&mainQuery=&searchType=all&form=home "Viewfinder - Goods shed, Yate Railway Station, Station Road, Yate, Avon]''English Heritage''; Retrieved 2013-12-12</ref> The station was reopened on 11 May 1989 with the backing of Gloucestershire County Council.

When first open, trains headed south along the original B&GR/Midland route via {{rws|Fishponds}} to reach Bristol, although a connection was subsequently laid in to link this route with the rival [[Great Western Railway]]'s 1903 "Badminton Line" from [[Wooton Bassett]] to {{rws|Patchway}} (the current [[South Wales Main Line]]) in 1908.  The new connection left the older line by means a [[flying junction]] at Yate South<ref>[http://www.s-r-s.org.uk/html/mid/S666.htm Yate South Junction signalling diagram]''Signalling Record Society''; Retrieved 2013-12-12</ref> before heading southwest to join the SWML at the triangular [[Westerleigh Junction]].  Though jointly built by the two companies for the purpose of giving the GWR access to the [[Severn Rail Bridge]] and [[Severn and Wye Railway]], it also provided an alternative route to Bristol Temple Meads via [[Filton]] and the Great Western soon made use of it to compete with the Midland for Bristol to Birmingham traffic, much to the dismay of the latter company.  All services now use this newer line to get to Bristol, as the original 1844 route through {{rws|Mangotsfield}} was abandoned in January 1970 following the completion of the Bristol area resignalling scheme.  A short section of the old route was retained from Yate South Junction after the rest closed, to serve a domestic waste transfer depot & fuel oil distribution terminal at Westerleigh sidings.<ref>[http://www.railbrit.co.uk/location.php?loc=Westerleigh%20North%20Junction Railscot - Westerleigh North Junction] www.railbrit.co.uk; Retrieved 2013-12-13</ref> This line is still in use today.

It is the junction station for the [[Thornbury Branchline]], however the passenger stations on this branch have long since closed (trains ceased in 1944) and the line remained open to serve [[Tytherington Quarry]] until September 2013, when it was placed 'Out of Use' by [[Network Rail]] following the mothballing of the quarry at the beginning of the year.<ref name=NRstncg12013west565>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/network%20code/network%20change/completed%20proposals/western/stncg12013west565%20tytherington%20branch/p%20stncg12013west565%20establishment.pdf |title=Establishment of proposed G1 Short Term Network Change: Tytherington Branch (from 0m 30ch) Designation as "Out of Use (temporary)" |date=10 September 2013 |id=STNC/G1/2013/WEST/565 |publisher=Network Rail |location=Swindon |accessdate=3 November 2013 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.gazetteseries.co.uk/news/10129514.Calls_to_restore_railway_line_following_quarry_closure/ "Calls to Restore Railway Line Following Quarry Closure"] Souvebois, Marion,''Gloucestershire Gazette'' news article 2-01-2013; Retrieved 2013-12-12</ref><ref>[http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/New-lease-life-planned-tracks-Thornbury-quarry/story-17756234-detail/story.html "New Lease of Life Planned For Tracks Behind Thornbury Quarry"] Gardner, Rachel ''Bristol Post'' article 5-01-2013; Retrieved 2013-12-12</ref>

In the [[Strategic Rail Authority]]<U+2019>s 2007/08 financial year, Yate was ranked as the 1104th most-used station in the UK.

== Services ==
The station is served Monday to Saturday by a train every hour in both directions between {{stnlnk|Gloucester}} and {{stnlnk|Westbury}} via Bristol Temple Meads (with two-hourly extensions to/from Worcester & {{stnlnk|Great Malvern}}, and to/from {{stnlnk|Weymouth}}) southbound, plus a single service to/from {{rws|Brighton}}).<ref>GB National Rail Timetable 2013-14, Table 123 (Network Rail)</ref> There have been proposals put forward to run additional services to/from Bristol as part of the second phase of the [[Greater Bristol Metro]] plans first put forward in 2008 and rebranded as "MetroWest" in 2013.<ref>[http://www.travelwest.info/sites/default/files/documents/MetroWest%20briefing%20note%20June%202013.pdf MetroWest Phase 2]''MetroWest Briefing Note, June 2013'', Travelwest.info; Retrieved 2013-12-13</ref>  If implemented the station would become the new northern terminus of the current {{rws|Weston-super-Mare}} to {{rws|Bristol Parkway}} local service, though this wouldn't happen until after Phase 1 of the scheme is completed in 2019.

Yate station is also served by a two-hourly Sunday service.  A normal service operates on most bank holidays.
