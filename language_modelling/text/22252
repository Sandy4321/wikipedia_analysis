'''Tony Zendejas''' (born [[May 15]] [[1960]] in [[Curimeo]], Michoacan, [[Mexico]]) is a retired [[American football|football]] [[placekicker]] who played for the [[Houston Oilers]], the [[Los Angeles Rams]], the [[Atlanta Falcons]], and the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. Before his [[National Football League]] career, he played in the [[United States Football League]] for the [[Los Angeles Express]], and was chosen by the [[Washington Redskins]] in the first round of the 1984 [[NFL Draft#Supplemental Draft|Supplemental Draft]]. In 1991 he became the first kicker in NFL history to convert all of his [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] attempts, going 17 for 17.{{fact|date=February 2008}} He did, however, miss one [[Extra point|PAT]] thereby allowing legendary kicker [[Gary Anderson]] to have the first "Perfect Season" (converting all FG attempts and PAT attempts) in 1998.

On July 10th, 2008, Los Angeles County prosecutors charged Zendejas with 4 felony counts with one count each of rape by use of drugs, rape of an unconscious person, sodomy by anesthesia or controlled substance and sodomy of an unconscious victim after the alleged rape of a female customer of his [[San Dimas, California|San Dimas]] sports bar in January. 
On September 22, 2008, Zendejas was arraigned in Pomona Superior Court where he plead not guilty. Despite being charged with drugging the alleged victim, toxicology reports found no traces of drugs through blood, urine or hair follicle tests.  Zendejas' preliminary hearing is scheduled for October 23, in Pomona where the state will not provide  any toxicology reports since a second toxicology exam did not yield any results. 
On December 6, 2008, Zendejas' attorneys made a motion to drop the two charges against Zendejas for drugging the alleged victim which will be heard on January 9, 2008. To date the district attorney has failed to provide any evidence the alleged victim was ever drugged other than the alleged victim's own words. An expert hired by Zendejas, who had previously never testified for a defendant, refused to testify for the district attorney. 
Tony Zendejas' trial was set to begin on January 21, 2009 and was pushed back to the second week of February.
