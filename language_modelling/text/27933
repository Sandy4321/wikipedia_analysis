'''''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt''''' is the debut solo album by [[John Frusciante]] released on [[March 8]], [[1994]] on [[American Recordings]]. Frusciante released the album after encouragement from several friends, who told him that there was "no good music around anymore".<ref name=jfcom-niandra>{{cite web|publisher=Johnfrusciante.com|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/music/niandra.php|title=''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt''|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> 

''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' combines [[avant-garde]] and [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream-of-consciousness]] styles, with guitar, piano and various effects and synthesizers on a four-track recorder. The album's first half, ''Niandra Lades'', was recorded before Frusciante left the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1992; during the recording of ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]''. The second half, ''Usually Just a T-Shirt'', was recorded after Frusciante's departure. ''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' sold poorly upon its release in 1994, and was taken off the market. The album was subsequently re-released in 1999.

==Context==
Frusciante joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1988, at the age of 18, and released his first album with the group, ''[[Mother's Milk]]'' that same year. The follow-up album, ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'', was recorded in an empty mansion that the band decided to live in for the duration of recording.<ref name=pp274>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 274<U+2013>275</ref> Frusciante adapted well to the environment, and often spent his time alone painting, listening to music, and recording songs that would eventually make up the album's first half, ''Niandra Lades''.<ref name=pp274/> ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' was released on [[September 24]], [[1991]] and was an instant success. The album peaked at #3 in the U.S. and went on to sell over 12 million copies worldwide.<ref name=billboardrhcp>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=5507&model.vnuAlbumId=815996|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Albums Charting|accessdate=2007-09-12|publisher=''Billboard''}}</ref><ref name=RIAA>{{Cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH|title=Certification search|accessdate=2007-09-21|publisher=RIAA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/od/discographies/a/redhotdisc.htm|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers discography|accessdate=2007-09-12|publisher=Top40}}</ref> Soon after the album's release, Frusciante developed a dislike of the band's newfound popularity. He felt that the band was too famous, and wished they were still playing small nightclubs like they were before he joined the group.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 229</ref> By his own admission, the band's rise to popularity took Frusciante by surprise, and he could not cope with it.<ref>{{ cite web | last = Gabriella. | url = http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/rhcp_int.htm | title = "Interview with the Red Hot Chili Peppers".

{{sample box end}}
After leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante continued to write and record solo material. He had been doing so since the age of nine, but had never considered releasing his material to the public.<ref name=VPRO>[http://youtube.com/watch?v=tegL__ECTzY VPRO Interview] with John Frusciante (1994)</ref> That was until several of his friends<U+2014>including [[Johnny Depp]], [[Perry Farrell]], [[Gibby Haynes]] and former Red Hot Chili Peppers band mate [[Flea (musician)|Flea]]<U+2014>encouraged him to release the material he wrote in his spare time during the ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' sessions.<ref name=VPRO/><ref name=bboard>Kenneally, Tim. ([[October 1]], [[1994]]) "Frusciante Steps Out With American Set". ''Billboard Magazine''</ref> Frusciante began recording final cuts of the songs he had been writing since his departure, and [[Record producer|producing]] them at his home in late 1993. The production process, however, became hampered by his increasingly severe addiction to heroin. Most of ''Usually Just a T-Shirt'' was recorded while Frusciante was heavily intoxicated by the drug. The effect his drug use had on album is exemplified on the album's second track, "My Smile is a Rifle".<ref name=jfcom-niandra/> Frusciante's use of heroin and [[crack cocaine]] became more extreme during the final stages of recording in late 1993; he began viewing drugs as the only way to "make sure you stay in touch with beauty instead of letting the ugliness of the world corrupt your soul."<ref name=jfcom-niandra/><ref name=VPRO/>

During a 1994 interview, a visibly intoxicated Frusciante noted that he wrote the album in order to create "interesting music", which he felt no longer existed. He felt contemporary artists were not writing material he deemed worth listening to and the mainstream population were settling for mediocrity.<ref name=VPRO/> Drugs were another significant topic Frusciante based ''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' on.<ref>Apter, 2004. p. 278</ref> He increased his drug use to cope with worsening depression that was caused by leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and his subsequent isolation. Several songs on the album deal with his dislike for the Chili Pepper's success, such the album's eleventh track, "Blood on My Neck From Success".<ref name=selvaggio>{{Cite web|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/interviews/translation_mucchioselvaggio.pdf|title= "John Frusciante: Perso e Ritrovato"|format=PDF |publisher=johnfrusciante.com Il Mucchio.

''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' incorporated Frusciante's [[avant-garde]] style of song composition, with his [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream-of-consciousness]] methodology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wm01.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:wnftxq9ald0e|author=Planer, Lindsay|title=''Shadows Collide With People'' review|accessdate=2007-12-02|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref><ref name=rollingstone>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/johnfrusciante/albums/album/146562/review/5944990/niandra_lades__usually_just_a_tshirt|author=Hoard, Christian|title=''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' review|publisher=''Rolling Stone''|accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref><ref name=amgreview>{{Cite web|url=http://wm10.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:ke0qoaeauijx|title=''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' review|author=Huey, Steve|publisher=All Music Guide|accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref> He recorded, mixed, produced and mastered the entire record by himself, and released it on Rick Rubin's label, [[American Recordings]].<ref name=jfcom-niandra/> [[Warner Bros.

==Release, reception and aftermath==
''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' was initially previewed by ''Billboard'' magazine, who said that "Chili Peppers fans might be daunted by the album's elusive experimentalism."<ref name=Apter>Apter, 2004. p. 279</ref> A representative of American Recordings did not foresee the album as being viable in any mainstream music stores, and some retailers went as far as to ban it from being sold.<ref name=Apter/> After the album was released, Frusciante played three small performances, and participated in a few magazine interviews to promote the album; explaining in one interview that people would only be able to understand his work if "their heads are capable of tripping out".<ref name=Apter/> At one point shortly after release, Frusciante began searching for a string quartet to play the album with him on tour. The idea was eventually discarded when he could not find a band that "understands why [[Ringo Starr]] is such a great drummer, can play [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], and also smokes pot."<ref name=Apter/> The concept of a tour was ultimately abandoned as well, due to Frusciante's diminishing health.<ref name=Apter/>

''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' was not widely reviewed, but yielded a generally positive response from critics. Steve Huey of [[All Music Guide]], who rated the album four out of five stars, said that "[the album was] an intriguing and unexpected departure from Frusciante's work with the Chili Peppers", and that "the sparse arrangements of the first half help set the stage for the gossamer guitar work later on."<ref name=amgreview/> He went on to say that ''Usually Just a T-Shirt''<U+2014>the latter half of the album<U+2014>contained "pleasant psychedelic instrumentals with plenty of backward-guitar effects."<ref name=amgreview/> Ned Raggett, also of All Music Guide, noted that "there's nothing quite so stunning as [Frusciante's] magnificent remake of [[Bad Brains]]' 'The Big Takeover'."<ref name=smileamg>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:1kqog4gmtv2z|author=Raggett, Ned|title=''Smile From the Streets You Hold'' review|publisher=All Music Guide|accessdate=2008-01-12}}</ref> Adam Williams of [[PopMatters]] said that the album "fall[s] somewhere between madness and brilliance". He went on to compare Frusciante to [[Syd Barrett]], and felt that the album was a "hint at a deeply cerebral artist looking within for inspiration and creativity."<ref name=Pop>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/f/frusciantejohn-niandra.shtml|title=''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' review|author=Williams, Adam|accessdate=2007-12-30|publisher=PopMatters}}</ref> The album received its share of negative criticism as well. ''[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone's]]'' Christian Hoard, felt "Frusciante's eccentricities run seriously amok", and that " [the album] sounds like a string of four-track demos. The first part of the album is slightly more tuneful than the more ambient, experimental second section[...] Mostly what you get are Frusciante's acoustic-guitar scratchings and stream-of-conscious ramblings."<ref name=rollingstone/> The first ''Rolling Stone'' review of the record, however, was positive: "All in all, [the album is] a mess - but definitely a fascinating, often lovely mess. As one might expect of an album titled ''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-shirt'' this is twisted, cool stuff."<ref name=rsreview1>Wild, David ([[December]], [[1994]]). "As If We Needed One, Here's A Reminder of Dylan's Power." ''Rolling  Stone''.</ref> The ''Boston Herald'' said that while the album was "a stark display of Frusciante's acoustic guitar virtuosity" and "...eerily beautiful", the singing was "terrible; his high notes will drive the neighborhood dogs into a frenzy."<ref name=bherald>"Music Discs Dionne Farris' arresting vocals bloom into." ''Boston Herald''. December 9, 1994.</ref>

[[Image:JohnNiandraLades1994.jpg|125px|thumb|left|Frusciante in 1994 during a VPRO interview at his home in [[Venice, Los Angeles, California|Venice Beach]], [[California]]]]Frusciante's drug addiction worsened as the years progressed. An article published by the ''[[New Times LA]]'' described him as "a skeleton covered in thin skin".<ref name="pnt"/> He participated in an interview with Dutch public broadcast station [[VPRO]]<U+2014>the first media appearance he made since leaving the Chili Peppers.<ref name=VPRO/> In the interview Frusciante speaks of the positive effects drugs have had on his mind and proudly admits to being a "[[junkie]]". He went on to confess addictions to heroin and crack cocaine, but ultimately described himself as being in the best health of his life.<ref name=VPRO/> In 1997, Frusciante released his second solo album ''[[Smile From the Streets You Hold]]'', primarily for drug money.<ref name=jfsmile>{{cite web|publisher=Johnfrusciante.com|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/music/smile.php|title=''Smile from the Streets You Hold''|accessdate=2006-09-04}}</ref><ref name=AMG>{{Cite web|url=http://wc10.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:d9fixqqjld0e|title=''Smile From the Streets You Hold'' review|author=Raggett, Ned|accessdate=2007-09-22|publisher=All Music Guide}}</ref> ''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' was estimated to have sold only 45,000 copies when Frusciante ordered it out of print in 1998<U+2014>when Frusciante rehabilitated and rejoined the Chili Peppers.<ref name=jfcom-niandra/> ''Smile From the Streets You Hold'' was withdrawn from the market a year later.<ref name=jfsmile>{{cite web|publisher=Johnfrusciante.com|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/music/smile.php|title=''Smile from the Streets You Hold''|accessdate=2006-09-04}}</ref><ref name=AMG/> In 1999 ''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' was re-released on American Recordings.<ref name=jfcom-niandra/> Frusciante has said he plans to re-release ''Smile From the Streets You Hold'' sometime in the future, but has not given any indication as to when.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Johnfrusciante.com|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/news.php|title="A Little Message from John to the Fans"|date=[[March 16]], [[2005]]|accessdate=2006-06-08}}</ref>
