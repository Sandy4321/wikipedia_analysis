The '''Bobcat''' (''Lynx rufus''), occasionally known as the '''Bay Lynx''', is a North American [[mammal]] of the cat family, [[Felidae]]. With twelve recognized [[subspecies]], it ranges from southern [[Canada]] to northern [[Mexico]], including much of the continental United States. The Bobcat is an adaptable [[predator]] that inhabits wooded areas, as well as semi-desert, urban edge, and swampland environments. It persists in much of its original range and populations are healthy.

With a gray to brown coat, whiskered face, and black-tufted ears, the Bobcat resembles the other species of the mid-sized ''[[Lynx]]'' genus. It is smaller than the [[Canadian Lynx]], with whom it shares parts of its range, but about twice as large as the domestic cat. It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped, stubby tail, from which it derives its name.

Though the Bobcat prefers [[rabbit]]s and [[hare]]s, it will hunt anything from [[insect]]s and small [[rodent]]s to [[deer]]. Prey selection depends on location and habitat, season, and abundance. Like most cats, the Bobcat is territorial and largely solitary, although there is some overlap in home ranges. It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries, including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces. The Bobcat breeds from winter into the spring and has a gestation period of about two months. 

The Bobcat has been subject to extensive hunting by humans, both for sport and fur, but its population has proven resilient. The elusive predator has featured in [[Native American mythology]] and the folklore of European settlers.

==Taxonomy==

There had been debate over whether to classify this species as ''Lynx rufus'' or ''Felis rufus'', part of a wider issue regarding whether the four species of ''Lynx'' should be given their own [[genus]], or be placed as a [[subgenus]] of ''[[Felis]]''.<ref name=lox>{{cite book | author = Zielinski, William J; Kuceradate, Thomas E | date = 1998 | title = American Marten, Fisher, Lynx, and Wolverine: Survey Methods for Their Detection | publisher = DIANE Publishing | id = ISBN 0788136283 | pages = 77-8}}</ref><ref name=CanLynx>{{cite web | author=Carron Meaney; Gary P.

Johnson ''et al.'' report that ''Lynx'' shared a [[clade]] with the ''[[Puma]]'', leopard cat (''[[Prionailurus]]''), and domestic cat (''Felis'') lineages, dated to 7.15&nbsp;[[Megaannum|Ma]]; ''Lynx'' diverged first, approximately 3.24&nbsp;Ma. (There are significant confidence intervals for both figures.)<ref name=Johnson2006>{{cite journal | author = Johnson, W.E., Eizirik, E., Pecon-Slattery, J., Murphy, W.J., Antunes, A., Teeling, E. & O'Brien, S.J. | year = 2006 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5757/73 | title = The Late Miocene radiation of modern Felidae: A genetic assessment. | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 311 | pages = 73-77}}</ref>

The Bobcat is believed to have evolved from the [[Eurasian Lynx]], which crossed into North America by way of the [[Bering land bridge]] during the [[Pleistocene]], with progenitors arriving as much as 2.6 Ma.<ref name=CanLynx/> The first wave moved into the southern portion of North America, which was soon cut off from the north by [[glacier]]s. This population evolved into modern Bobcats around 20,000 years ago. A second population arrived from Asia and settled in the north, creating the modern Canadian Lynx.<ref name=lox/>  Hybridization with the Canadian Lynx may sometimes occur (see [[Felid hybrid]])<ref>{{cite book | author = Mills, L.

===Subspecies===	 
			
Twelve Bobcat subspecies are currently recognised: 
* ''L. rufus rufus'' (Schreber)
* ''L. rufus gigas'' (Bangs) 
* ''L. rufus floridanus'' (Rafinesque)
* ''L. rufus superiorensis'' (Peterson & Downing) 
* ''L. rufus baileyi'' (Merriam)
* ''L. rufus californicus'' (Mearns) 
* ''L. rufus escuinipae'' (J. A. Allen)
* ''L. rufus fasciatus'' (Rafinesque) 
* ''L. rufus oaxacensis'' (Goodwin) 
* ''L. rufus pallescens'' (Merriam) 
* ''L. rufus peninsularis'' (Thomas)
* ''L. rufus texensis'' (Mearns).<ref name=msw3/>

The main subspecies, found in much of the eastern United States, is the nominate: ''L. rufus rufus''. To the north, in [[Maine]] and Canada, lives ''L. rufus gigas'', and to the south ''L. rufus floridanus''.<ref name=Whitaker>{{cite book | author = Whitaker, John O; Hamilton, W J | date = [[1998-01-01]] | title = Mammals of the Eastern United States | publisher = Cornell University Press | id = ISBN 0801434750 | pages = 493-6}}</ref> The subspecies division has been challenged, given a lack of clear geographic breaks in the Bobcat range and the minor character of differences between subspecies.<ref name=Proposal>{{cite web |url=http://www.cites.org/common/cop/13/raw_props/US-Lynx%20rufus.pdf |title= Deletion of bobcat (Lynx rufus) from Appendix II |accessdate=2007-05-31 |year=2004 |month=October |format=PDF |work=Thirteenth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties, Proposal 5 |publisher= [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]]}}</ref>

==Physical characteristics==
[[Image:bobcat500.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A Bobcat finds water in Tucson.]]
The Bobcat resembles other species of the ''Lynx'' genus but is on average the smallest of the four. Its coat is variable, though generally tan to grayish brown, with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail. Its spotted patterning allows it to blend into its environment. The ears are black-tipped and pointed, with short black tufts. There is generally an off-white color on the lips, chin, and underparts. Bobcats in the desert regions of the southwest have the lightest colored coats, while those in the northern, forested regions are darkest. Kittens are born well-furred and already have their spots.<ref name=cah>{{cite book | author = Cahalane, Victor H | date = [[2005-03-01]] | title = Meeting the Mammals | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | id = ISBN 141799522X | pages = 64}}</ref>  

The face appears wide due to ruffs of extended hair beneath the ears.  The fur is brittle but quite long and dense.  The nose of the Bobcat is pinkish-red, and it has a base color of gray, yellowish, or brownish-red on its face, sides, and back. Bobcat eyes are yellow with black pupils.<ref name=utd>{{cite book | author = Sparano, Vin T | date = September 1998 | title = Complete Outdoors Encyclopedia | publisher = St. Martin's Press | id = ISBN 0312191901 | pages = 228}}</ref>  The pupils are shaped vertically and will widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception.<ref name=cons>{{cite book | author = McDowell, Robert L | date = Apr 2003 | title = Endangered and Threatened Wildlife of New Jersey | publisher = Rutgers University Press | id = ISBN 0813532094 | pages = 23-4, 27}}</ref>

The adult male Bobcat is 28 to 47&nbsp;inches (70<U+2013>120&nbsp;cm) long, averaging 36&nbsp;inches (90&nbsp;cm); this includes a stubby 4 to 7&nbsp;inch (10<U+2013>18&nbsp;cm) tail,<ref name=utd/> which has a "bobbed" appearance and gives the species its name. It stands about 14 or 15&nbsp;inches (36<U+2013>38&nbsp;cm) at the shoulders.<ref name=cah/> Adult males usually range from 16 to 30&nbsp;pounds (7<U+2013>14&nbsp;kg); females average about 20&nbsp;pounds (9&nbsp;kg). The Bobcat is muscular, and its hind legs are longer than its front legs, giving it a bobbing gait.  At birth it weighs 0.6 to 0.75&nbsp;pounds (280<U+2013>340&nbsp;g) and is about 10&nbsp;inches (25&nbsp;cm) in length. By its first year it will reach about 10&nbsp;pounds (4.5&nbsp;kg).<ref name=wl>{{cite book | author = Fergus, Charles | date = [[2003-08-01]] | title = Wildlife of Virginia and Maryland Washington D.C | publisher = Stackpole Books | id = ISBN 0811728218 | pages = 119}}</ref>

[[Image:bobcat tracks in mud.jpg|thumb|right|Bobcat tracks in mud. Note the hind print (top) partially covering the fore print (center).]] 
The cat has sharp hearing and vision, and a good sense of smell. It is also an excellent climber. The Bobcat will swim when it needs to, but will normally avoid water.<ref name=wl/> A few [[melanism|melanistic]] bobcats have been sighted and captured in [[Florida]]. They appear black, but may actually still exhibit a spot pattern.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ulmer, Jr., Fred A. | year = 1941 | url = http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-2372%28194108%2922%3A3%3C285%3AMITFWS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-T | title = Melanism in the Felidae, with Special Reference to the Genus Lynx | journal = Journal of Mammalogy | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 285-288}}</ref>

===Tracks===

Bobcat tracks show four toes and no claw marks, due to retractable claws. The tracks can range in size from 1 to 3&nbsp;inches (2<U+2013>8&nbsp;cm); the average is about 1.8 inches<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcadventure.com/adventure/wilderness/animals/bobcat.htm |title=Bobcat
 |accessdate=2007-06-25 |work=bcadventure.com |publisher=Interactive Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref> (as seen in photograph at right). When walking or trotting, the tracks are spaced roughly 8 to 18&nbsp;inches (20<U+2013>46&nbsp;cm) apart. The Bobcat can make great strides when running, often from 4 to 8&nbsp;feet (1<U+2013>3&nbsp;m).<ref>{{cite book | author = Peterson, Roger Tory; Murie, Olaus Johan | date = [[1998-01-15]] | title = A Field Guide to Animal Tracks | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Field Guides | id = ISBN 0395910943 | pages = 115}}</ref> 

Like all cats, the Bobcat ''[[direct register|directly register]]s'', meaning its hind prints usually fall exactly on top of its fore prints (not seen in photograph). Bobcat tracks can be generally distinguished from [[feral cat|feral]] or house cat tracks by their larger size: approximately 2&nbsp;in<U+00B2> (5&nbsp;cm<U+00B2>) versus 1.5&nbsp;in<U+00B2> (3.8&nbsp;cm<U+00B2>).<ref>{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Brown (naturalist) |title= Tom Brown's Field Guide to Nature Observation and Tracking  |year=1986 |publisher=Berkley Trade |isbn= 9780425099667 }}</ref>

==Behavior==

The Bobcat is [[crepuscular]], generally most active at twilight and dawn. It keeps on the move from three hours before sunset until about midnight, and then again from before dawn until three hours after sunrise. Each night it will move from 2 to 7&nbsp;miles (3-11&nbsp;km) along its habitual route.<ref name=wl/> This behavior may vary seasonally, as Bobcats become more [[diurnal animal|diurnal]] during fall and winter. This is a response to the activity of their prey, which are more active during the day in colder months.<ref name=cons/>

===Social structure and home range===

Bobcat activities are confined to well-defined territories, which vary in size depending on sex and distribution of prey. The home range is [[territorial marking|marked]] with feces, urine scent, and by clawing prominent trees in the area. In its territory the Bobcat will have numerous places of shelter, usually a main den, and several auxiliary shelters on the outer extent of its range, such as hollow logs, brush piles, thickets, or under rock ledges. The odor of its den is strong.<ref name=Whitaker/>

The sizes of Bobcat home ranges vary significantly; a [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) summary of research finds suggests ranges anywhere from .02 to 126&nbsp;mi<U+00B2> (0.6 to 326&nbsp;[[km]]<U+00B2>).<ref name=CAP/> One study in [[Kansas]] found resident males to have roughly a 8&nbsp;mi<U+00B2> (20&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) range and females less than half that. Transient Bobcats were found to have both a larger (roughly 22&nbsp;mi<U+00B2> or 57&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) and less well defined home range. Kittens had the smallest range at about 3&nbsp;mi<U+00B2> (7&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) .<ref name=Kansas>{{cite journal |last=Kamler |first=JF |coauthors=Gipson, PS |year=2000 |month=Jul-Sep |title=Home Range, Habitat Selection, and Survival of Bobcats, Lynx rufus, in a Prairie Ecosystem in Kansas |journal=Canadian Field-Naturalist |volume=114 |issue=3 |pages=388-94 |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=ENV&recid=4848238&q=Lynx+rufus&uid=1023712&setcookie=yes |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> Research has shown that dispersal from the [[birth|natal]] range is most pronounced with males.<ref name=Texas/>

Reports on seasonal variation in range size have been equivocal. One study found a large variation in male range sizes, from 16&nbsp;mi<U+00B2> (41&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) in summer up to 40&nbsp;mi<U+00B2>(100&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) in winter.<ref name=Whitaker/> Another found that female Bobcats, especially those reproductively active, expanded their home range in winter, but that males merely shifted their range  without expanding it, which was consistent with numerous earlier studies.<ref name=range>{{cite journal |last = Lovallo |first = Matthew J. |coauthors = Anderson, Eric M. |year = 1996 |month = April |title= Bobcat (Lynx rufus) Home Range Size and Habitat Use in Northwest Wisconsin |journal= American Midland Naturalist |volume = 135 |issue = 2 |pages = 247-8}}</ref> Other research in various American states has shown little or no seasonal variation.<ref name=Kansas/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Nielsen |first=Clayton K. |coauthors=Alan Woolf |year=2001 |month=July |title=Spatial Organization of Bobcats (Lynx rufus) in Southern Illinois |journal=The American Midland Naturalist |volume=146 |issue=1 |pages=43-52 |url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&doi=10.1674%2F0003-0031(2001)146%5B0043%3ASOOBLR%5D2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=2007-05-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Chamberlain |first=Michael I. |coauthors=Bruce D.

Like most felines, the Bobcat is largely solitary but ranges will often overlap. Unusually for a cat, males are more tolerant of overlap, while females rarely wander into others' ranges.<ref name=range/> Given their smaller ranging, two or more females may reside within a male's home range. When multiple male territories overlap a dominance hierarchy is often established resulting in the exclusion of some transients from favored areas. 

In-line with wide estimates of home range size, population density figures are divergent, anywhere from 1 to 38 Bobcats per 25&nbsp;mi<U+00B2> (65&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) in one survey.<ref name=CAP/> The average is estimated at one Bobcat per every 5&nbsp;mi<U+00B2> (13&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), or slightly less.<ref name=Whitaker/> A link has been observed between population density and sex ratio. One study noted that a dense, unharvested population in [[California]] had a sex ratio of 2.1 males per female. When the density decreased, the sex ratio skewed to 0.86 males per female. Another study observed a similar ratio, and suggested that males may be better able to cope with the increased competition, and that this would help limit reproduction until various factors would lower the density.<ref name=mort/>

===Hunting and diet===
[[Image:Snowshoe Hare.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Snowshoe Hare]] is a principal prey species of the Bobcat.]]
The Bobcat is able to go for long periods without food, but will eat heavily when prey is abundant. During lean periods, it will often prey on larger animals that it can catch and come back to later. The Bobcat hunts by stalking its prey and then ambushing it with a short chase or pounce. Its preference is for mammals about 1.5 to 12.5&nbsp;pounds (0.7 to 5.7&nbsp;kg) in weight. Its main prey varies by region. In the eastern United States it is [[cottontail rabbit]]s, and in the north it is the [[Snowshoe Hare]]. When these prey exist together, as in [[New England]], they both form the primary sustenance of the Bobcat. In the far south, the rabbit and hare are sometimes replaced by [[cotton rat]]s as the primary food source. The Bobcat is an [[generalist and specialist species|opportunistic]] predator that, unlike the more specialized Canadian Lynx, will readily vary its prey selection.<ref name=CAP/> Research has shown that diet diversification positively correlates to a decline in numbers of the Bobcat's principal prey; the abundance of its main prey species is thus the main determinant of overall diet.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Baker |first=Leslie A. |coauthors= Robert J. Warrena; Duane R. Diefenbacha; William E. James; Michael J. Conroy |year=2001 |month=January |title= Prey Selection by Reintroduced Bobcats (Lynx rufus) on Cumberland Island, Georgia |journal=The American Midland Naturalist |volume=145 |issue=1 |pages=80-93 |doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2001) |url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&doi=10.1674%2F0003-0031(2001)145%5B0080%3APSBRBL%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref>

The Bobcat hunts animals of different sizes, and will adjust its hunting techniques accordingly. With small animals, such as rodents, squirrels, birds, and also fish and insects, it will hunt in areas known to be abundant in prey, and will lie, crouch, or stand still and wait for victims to wander close. It will then pounce, grabbing its prey with its sharp, retractable claws. For slightly larger animals, such as rabbits and hares, it will stalk from a covering and wait until they come within 20 to 35&nbsp;feet (6 to 10&nbsp;m) before rushing in to attack. Less commonly it will feed on larger animals such as foxes, minks, skunks, small dogs and house cats.<ref name=Whitaker/> 

It has been known to kill [[deer]], especially in winter when smaller prey is scarce, or when deer populations become more abundant. One study in the [[Everglades]] showed a large majority of kills were [[fawn]]s (33 of 39) but that prey up to eight times the Bobcat's weight could be successfully taken.<ref name=Everglades>{{cite journal |last=Labisky |first=Ronald F. |coauthors=Margaret C. Boulay |month=April|year=1998 |title= Behaviors of Bobcats Preying on White-tailed Deer in the Everglades |journal=The American Midland Naturalist |volume=139|issue=2 |pages=275<U+2013>281 |url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&doi=10.1674%2F0003-0031(1998)139%5B0275%3ABOBPOW%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> It stalks the deer, often when the deer is lying down, then rushes in and grabs it by the neck before biting through the throat, base of the skull, or chest. While the Bobcat rarely kills deer, when it does it eats its fill and then buries the carcass under snow or leaves, often returning to it several times to feed.<ref name=Whitaker/>

The Bobcat prey base overlaps with that of other mid-sized predators of a similar ecological niche. Research in [[Maine]] has shown little evidence of competitive relationships between the Bobcat and [[Coyote]] or [[Red Fox]]; separation distances and territory overlap appeared random amongst simultaneously monitored animals.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Major |first=JT |coauthors=JA Sherburne | year=1987 |title= Interspecific relationships of coyotes, bobcats, and red foxes in western Maine |journal=Journal of Wildlife Management |volume=51|issue=3 |pages=606-616 |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=ENV&recid=1651611|accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> With the Canadian Lynx, however, the [[Interspecific competition|interspecific relationship]] affects distribution patterns: competitive exclusion from the Bobcat likely prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its felid cousin.<ref name=CanLynx/> 

===Reproduction and life cycle===

Bobcats typically live to six or eight years of age, with a few reaching beyond ten. The longest they have been known to live is 16 years in the wild and 32 years in captivity.<ref name=mort/>

They generally begin [[mating|breeding]] by their second summer, though females may start as early as their first year.  Each year by September or October, sperm production begins, and the male will be fertile into the summer.  A dominant male will travel with a female and mate with her several times, generally from winter until early spring, varying by location, but most often mating during February and March.  The two may undertake a number of different behaviors, including bumping, chasing, and ambushing. Other males may be in attendance, but remain uninvolved. Once the male sees that the female is receptive, he grasps her in the typical felid neck grip. The female may go on to mate with other male cats,<ref name=Whitaker/> and males will generally mate with several females.<ref name=tx>{{cite book | author = Fischer, William C.; Miller, Melanie; Johnston, Cameron M.; Smith, Jane K. | date = [[1996-02-01]] | title = Fire Effects Information System | publisher = DIANE Publishing | id = ISBN 0788145681 | pages = 83}}</ref> During courtship, the otherwise silent Bobcat may let out loud screams, hisses, or other sounds.<ref name=wal>{{cite book | author = Nowak, Ronald M | date = Apr 1999 | title = Walker's Mammals of the World | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | id = ISBN 0801857899 | pages = 809}}</ref> Research in [[Texas]] has suggested that establishing a home range is necessary for breeding; studied animals with no set range had no identified offspring.<ref name=Texas>{{cite journal |last=Jane<U+010D>ka |first=JE |coauthors= TL Blankenship; DH Hirth; ME Tewes; CW Kilpatrick; LI Grassman Jr. |year=2006 |month=August |title=Kinship and social structure of bobcats (Lynx rufus) inferred from microsatellite and radio-telemetry data |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=269 |issue=4 |pages=494-501 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00099.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00099.x |accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref>  The female has an [[estrous cycle]] of 44 days, with the estrus lasting five to ten days. Bobcats remain reproductively active throughout their lives.<ref name=tx/><ref name=cons/>

The female raises the young alone. One to six, but usually two to four, kittens are born in April or May, after roughly 60 to 70 days of [[gestation]]. There may sometimes be a second litter, with births as late as September. The female generally gives birth in some sort of enclosed space, usually a small cave or hollow log. The young open their eyes by the ninth or tenth day. They start exploring their surroundings at four weeks and are weaned at about two months. Within three to five months they begin to travel with their mother.<ref name=wal/>  They will be hunting by themselves by their first fall and usually disperse shortly thereafter.<ref name=Whitaker/> In [[Michigan]], however, they have been observed staying with their mother as late as the next spring.<ref name=tx/>

====Predators and mortality====
[[Image:Bobcat skull Pengo.jpg|thumb|Skull of a bobcat]]
The adult Bobcat has few predators other than man, although it may be killed in interspecific conflict. [[Cougar]]s and [[Gray Wolf|Gray Wolves]] will kill adult Bobcats, a pattern repeatedly observed in [[Yellowstone National Park]].<ref>{{cite web | author = Holly Akenson, James Akenson, Howard Quigley |title=Winter Predation and Interactions of Wolves and Cougars on Panther Creek in Central Idaho|work=Wildlife: Wolves |publisher=[[Yellowstone National Park]]|url=http://www.yellowstonenationalpark.com/wolves.htm |accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> Kittens may be taken by several predators including owls, eagles, coyotes, foxes, as well as other adult male Bobcats; when prey populations are not abundant, fewer kittens are likely to reach adulthood. 

Diseases, accidents, hunters, automobiles, and starvation are the other leading causes of death. Juveniles show high mortality shortly after leaving their mothers, while still perfecting their hunting technique. One study of fifteen Bobcats showed yearly survival rates for both sexes averaged 0.62, in line with other research suggesting 0.56 to 0.67.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fuller |first=Todd K. |coauthors= Stephen L. Berendzen, Thomas A. Decker, James E.

The Bobcat may harbor external [[parasites]], mostly ticks and fleas, and will often carry the parasites of its prey, especially rabbits and squirrels. Internal parasites ([[Endoparasites]]) are especially common in Bobcats. One study found an average infection rate of 52% from ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', but with great regional variation.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kikuchi, Yoko | coauthors = Chomel, Bruno B; Kasten, Rickie W; Martenson, Janice S; Swift, Pamela K; O<U+2019>Brien, Stephen J | year = 2004 | month = Feb | title = Seroprevalence of ''Toxoplasma gondii'' in American free-ranging or captive pumas (''Felis concolor'') and bobcats (''Lynx rufus'') | journal = Veterinary Parasitology | volume = 120 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 1-9}}</ref>  One mite in particular, ''Lynxacarus morlani'', has to date only been found on the Bobcat.

==Distribution and habitat==

[[Image:bobcatonwires.jpg|240px|thumb|right|A male Bobcat in an urban surrounding, standing on wires]]
The Bobcat is an exceptionally adaptable animal. It prefers woodlands<U+2014>[[deciduous]], [[coniferous]], or mixed<U+2014>but unlike the other ''Lynx'' species, however it does not depend exclusively on the deep forest. It ranges from the humid swamps of Florida to rugged mountain areas. It will make its home near agricultural areas, if rocky ledges, swamps, or forested tracts are present, its spotted coat serving as camouflage.<ref name=Whitaker/> The population of the Bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey; other principal factors in the selection of habitat type include protection from severe weather, availability of resting and den sites, dense cover for hunting and escape, and freedom from disturbance.<ref name=Proposal/> 

The Bobcat's range does not seem to be limited by human populations as long as it can still find a suitable habitat; only large, intensively cultivated tracts are unsuitable for the species.<ref name=CAP/> The animal may appear in backyards in "urban edge" environments, where human development intersects with natural habitats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/samo/naturescience/bobcats.htm |title=Bobcats: Living on the Urban Edge |accessdate=2007-06-18 |publisher=[[National Park Service]], [[U.S. Department of the Interior]]}}</ref> If chased by a dog it will usually climb up a tree.<ref name=Whitaker/> 

The historical range of the Bobcat was from southern Canada, throughout the United States, and as far south as [[Oaxaca]], Mexico, and it still persists across much of this area. Range maps typically show a pocket of territory in the U.S. [[Midwest]] and parts of the Northeast where it is no longer thought to exist, including southern [[Minnesota]], eastern [[South Dakota]], [[Iowa]], and much of [[Missouri]], mostly due to habitat changes from modern agricultural practices.<ref name=Whitaker/><ref name=CAP/><ref name=cons/> While thought to no longer exist in western [[New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]], multiple confirmed sightings of Bobcats have been recently reported in New York's [[Southern Tier]] and in [[central New York]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-161466623.html | title = Elusive Bobcat Creeps into Region | author = Tobin, Dave | date = 2007-05-31 | work = Syracuse Post-Standard | accessdate = 2007-06-26}}</ref>

Its population in Canada is limited due to both snow depth and the presence of the Canadian Lynx. The Bobcat does not tolerate deep snow, and will hole up and wait out heavy storms;<ref name=park>{{cite web | author = National Park Service. Yellowstone National Park | title = Bobcat | url = http://www.nps.gov/yell/nature/animals/Bobcat/Bobcat.html | accessdate = 2006-08-24}}</ref> it lacks the large, padded feet of the Canadian Lynx and does not support its weight on snow as efficiently. The Bobcat is not entirely at a disadvantage where its range meets that of the larger felid: displacement of the Canadian Lynx by the aggressive Bobcat has been observed where they interact in [[Nova Scotia]], while the clearing of coniferous forests for agriculture has led to a northward retreat of the Canadian Lynx range to the advantage of the Bobcat.<ref name=CAP/> In northern and central Mexico, the cat is found in dry [[scrubland]] and forests of pine and oak; its range ends at the tropical southern portion of the country.<ref name=CAP/>

==Conservation==
[[Image:Rotluchs2.jpg|thumb|left|The Bobcat population has seen declines in the American Midwest, but is generally stable and healthy]]
The Bobcat is listed in Appendix II of the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.shtml |title=Appendices I, II and III |accessdate=2007-05-24 |publisher=[[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]]}}</ref> which means it is not considered threatened with extinction but that hunting and trading must be closely monitored. The animal is regulated in all three of its range countries and it is found in a number of [[protected areas of the United States]], its principal territory.<ref name=CAP/> Estimates from the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] placed Bobcat numbers between 700,000 and 1,500,000 in the U.S. in 1988, with increased range and population density suggesting even greater numbers in subsequent years; for these reasons, the U.S. has petitioned CITES to remove the cat from Appendix II.<ref name=Proposal/> Populations in Canada and Mexico remain stable and healthy. The IUCN lists it as a species of "[[least concern]]," noting that it is relatively widespread and abundant but that information from southern Mexico is poor.<ref name=iucn/>

Though the Bobcat once inhabited all of the American Midwest, they are now [[local extinction|extirpated]] in much of the region, a result of man-made habitat changes. Today the species is considered endangered in [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], and Iowa. It was removed from the threatened list of [[Illinois]] in 1999, and in Pennsylvania limited hunting and trapping is once again allowed, after having been banned from 1970 to 1999. The Bobcat also suffered population declines in [[New Jersey]] at the turn of the nineteenth century, mainly because of commercial and agricultural developments causing habitat fragmentation; by 1972, the Bobcat was given full legal protection, and listed as endangered in the state in 1991.<ref name=cons/>  ''L. rufus escuinipae'', the subspecies found in Mexico, was for a time considered endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, but was delisted in 2005.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-IMPACT/2005/May/Day-19/i10002.htm | title = Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; 12-Month Petition Finding and Proposed Rule To Delist the Mexican Bobcat (Lynx Rufus Escuinapae) | accessdate = 2007-06-27 | year= 2005 | month = May | publisher = Fish and Wildlife Service}}</ref>

===Human hunting and trapping===

The Bobcat is valued both for fur and sport, and has long been hunted and trapped by humans; it has maintained a high population, even in the southern United States where it is extensively hunted. Indirectly, kittens are most vulnerable to hunting given their dependence on an adult female for the first few months of life. In the 1970s and 1980s Bobcat [[fur clothing|fur]] saw an unprecedented rise in price causing further interest in hunting; by the early 1990s prices had dropped significantly.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dfg.ca.gov/hcpb/info/bm_research/bm_pdfrpts/96_05.pdf | format=PDF |title=Bobcat Harvest Assessment 1995-96 |accessdate=2007-05-26 |work= Bird and Mammal Conservation Program |publisher=[[California Department of Fish and Game]]}}</ref> Regulated hunting still continues, with half of mortality of some populations being attributed to this cause. As a result, the rate of Bobcat deaths is skewed in winter, when hunting season is generally open.<ref name=mort/>

==In mythology==

In [[Native American mythology]] the Bobcat is often twinned with the figure of the [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]] in a theme of duality.<ref>'Lynx' is used generically in mythological descriptions, but necessarily implies the Bobcat throughout much of the United States</ref> The Lynx and Coyote are associated with the wind and fog, respectively&mdash;two elements representing opposites in [[Amerindian]] folklore. This basic story, in many variations, is found in the native cultures of North America (with parallels in South America), but they diverge in the telling. One version, which appears in the [[Nez Perce]] folklore for instance, represents the Lynx and the Coyote as opposed, antithetical beings.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Pollock, Donald | year = 1993 | month = Mar | title = Histoire de Lynx, Review | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 95 | issue = 1 | pages = 223}}</ref>  However, another version represents them with equality and identicality.  [[Claude L<U+00E9>vi-Strauss]] argues that the former concept, that of twins representing opposites, is an inherent theme in New World mythologies, but that they are not equally balanced figures, representing an open-ended dualism rather than the symmetric duality of Old World cultures. The latter notion then, L<U+00E9>vi-Strauss suggests, is the result of regular contact between Europeans and native cultures. Additionally, the version found in the Nez Perce story is of much greater complexity, while the version of equality seems to have lost the tale's original meaning.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Yalman, Nur | year = 1996 | month = Nov | title = L<U+00E9>vi-Strauss in Wonderland: Playing Chess with Unusual Cats: The Story of Lynx | journal = American Ethnologist | volume = 23 | issue = 4| pages = 902}}</ref>

A [[Shawnee]] tale relates the reason for the Bobcat's spots. The Bobcat chased a rabbit and almost caught it, before it escaped by jumping in to a hollow tree.  The rabbit yelled out to the Bobcat that he will never get him in the tree, but Bobcat responded that the rabbit would eventually get hungry.  Rabbit knew he was right, and so suggested that the Bobcat build a fire to roast him after he ran out.  Bobcat agreed this was a good idea and did so.  When the fire was hot enough, rabbit jumped out of the tree into the fire, scattering the embers onto Bobcat's coat.  Bobcat jumped into the river, but the coals had left his fur singed with the dark brown spots that appear today.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jaxzoo.org/things/biofacts/FloridaBobcat.asp | title = Florida Bobcat Bio Facts | accessdate = 2007-06-27 | year = 2005 | publisher = Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens}}</ref> [[Mohave]] believed dreaming habitually of beings or objects would afford them their characteristics as supernatural powers. Dreaming of two deities, the Cougar and Lynx, they thought, would grant them the superior hunting skills of other tribes.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kroeber, A. L. | year = 1908 | month = Apr-Jun | title = Preliminary Sketch of the Mohave Indians | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 279}}</ref>  European settlers to the Americas also admired the cat, both for its ferocity and grace, and in the United States it "rests prominently in the anthology of our national folklore."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nd.edu/~ndmag/tempsp96.html |title=Wood Ghost |accessdate=2007-06-25 |last=Temple |first=Kerry |date=Spring 1996 |publisher=Notre Dame Magazine}}</ref>
