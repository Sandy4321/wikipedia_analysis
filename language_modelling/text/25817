'''Mile Budak''' (30 August 1889 - June 7, 1945) was a [[Croats|Croatian]] politcian and writer best known as one of the chief ideologists of the Croatian [[Usta<U+0161>e]] movement, which ruled the [[Independent State of Croatia]], or NDH, from 1941-45 and waged a genocidal campaign against its [[Serb]], [[Romani people|Roma]] and [[Jew]]ish minorities, and against the Croatian Resistance Movement. He created the Croatian national plan to get rid of Orthodox Serbs by killing one third, expelling one third and assimilating the rest.<ref> German Counterinsurgency Policy in Independent Croatia, 1941-1944. by Jonatan Guzm, The Historian September 22, 1998 issue</ref>

In 1914, after the start of [[World War I]], he was drafted in [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] where he received the rank of non-commissioned officer. In 1915 he will be captured by the Serbian Army and witnessed the Serb retreat through [[Albania]] in 1915-16.

After the end of war Mile Budak returned to Zagreb. In 1920 he received a law degree at University of Zagreb in 1920 and became clerk in the office of [[Ante Paveli<U+0107>]]. He became active in [[Party of Rights (1861-1929)|Croatian Party of Rights]] (HSP) and was elected in Zagreb City Assembly. In 1920s he was the editor of political magazines close to HSP.

==Usta<U+0161>e period==
[[File:Mile Budak 1932..jpg|thumb|Budak after the assassination attempt, 1933]]
Budak and [[Vladko Ma<U+010D>ek]] served as the lawyers representing [[Marko Hranilovi<U+0107>]] and Matija Soldin in a highly publicized trial amidst the [[January 6th Dictatorship]]. On June 7 1932 he survived an assassination attempt from men close to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. After, he emigrated to Italy, in order to join Usta<U+0161>e and to become commandant of an Usta<U+0161>e training camp<ref name="jasenovac-info.com"/>. In 1938 he returned to Zagreb, where he started ''Hrvatski narod'', a weekly newspaper. In 1940 authorities had that magazine banned, and Budak arrested. <ref>Review of International Affairs: Politics, Economics, Law, Science, Culture by Federation of Yugoslavic Journalists, Savez novinara Jugoslavije, Socijalisti<U+010D>ki savez radnog naroda Jugoslavije, published by The Federation, 1953 (page 25) <br> On March 4, 1940 Stepinac intervened with <U+0160>uba<U+0161>i<U+0107>, at the request of Prof. Lukas and M.

When the Independent State of Croatia was proclaimed, Mile Budak became chief propagandist<ref>Yugoslavia as History: Twice There was a Country by John R.

Croatian novelist [[Miroslav Krle<U+017E>a]] marked Budak as "a minister of culture with a machine gun"<ref name="jasenovac-info.com"/>. In a speech at Gospi<U+0107> on 22 July 1941 he declared: "The movement of the Ustashi is based on faith. For the minorities we have three million bullets. We shall kill one part of the Serbs, expell the second part, and covert to Catholicism the third part of them "<ref>Usta<U+0161>e: Croatian Separatism and European Politics, 1929-1945 by Srdja Trifkovic, London 1998 (page 141)</ref><ref> [[Magnum Crimen]] by Viktor Novak, Zagreb 1948 (page 605)</ref> This exposition of Usta<U+0161>e policy is attributed to Budak.<ref>Triple Myth by Stella Alexander, Columbia University Press 1987</ref>

He later became Croatian envoy to [[Nazi Germany]] (November 1941 - April 1943) and foreign minister (May 1943 - November 1943).<ref>The war we lost: Yugoslavia's Tragedy and the Failure of the West by Constantin Fotitch, published by Viking Press, 1948 (page 122)</ref><ref>War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941-1945: Occupation and Collaboration by Jozo Tomasevich, published by Stanford University Press, 2001 ISBN 0804736154, 9780804736152 (page 317)</ref> When the Independent State of Croatia collapsed, Mile Budak was captured by English military authorities and handed to [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] -  on May 18, 1945.

==Literary work==
Budak was also known for his literary work, especially novels and plays in which he had glorified Croatian peasantry. The best known of his work are: "Ognji<U+0161>te" (The Hearth)<ref>Herdfeuer. Roman. [Berecht. Uebersetzung aus d. Kroatischen von Franz Hille.] by Mile Budak, published by K. H. Bischoff Verl., 1943</ref>, "Opanci dida Vidurine" (Granpa Vidurina's Shoes)<ref>Opanci dida Vidurine by Mile Budak, Sandra Bel<U+010D>i<U+0107>, published by Zagreba<U+010D>ka stvarnost, 2001 ISBN 9531920710, 9789531920711</ref>, "Rascvjetana tre<U+0161>nja" (The Blossoming Cherry Tree). About his writing, E. E. Noth wrote: ''Here we find the stubborn, spiritual-realistic conception of man and his relation to the soil on which he lives and which Mile Budak symbolizes as "the hearth"''.<ref>Books Abroad: A Quarterly Publication Devoted to Comments on Foreign Books by Roy Temple House, Ernst Erich Noth, published by University of Oklahoma, 1940 (page 329)</ref>

After the war his books were banned by [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist]] authorities. Because of that, many Croatian nationalists viewed Mile Budak as great figure of [[Croatian literature]], equal, if not superior to left-wing [[Miroslav Krle<U+017E>a]]<ref>ibidem: Contemporary Croatian literature by Ante Kadi<U+0107></ref>. Following Croatian independence in early 1990s, in Croatia, where the ruling Croatian Democratic Union badly wanted to reinterpret the fascist Ustasha quislings of World War II as a Croatian patriotic force. ''Hence, the reissue in early 1993 of the collected works of Mile Budak,the second-in-command in the Ustasha regime. Commenting, at the time of this reissue, Croatian writer Giancarlo Kravar wrote: "... Ustashism, in its history, was undoubtly also a positive political movement for the state-building affirmation of Croatianism, the expression of the centuries-long aspiration of the Croatian people"<ref>Social Currents in Eastern Europe: The Sources and Consequences of the Great Transformation by Sabrina P. Ramet, Edition: 2, published by Duke University Press, 1995 ISBN 0822315483, 9780822315483 (page 418)</ref>

==Legacy==
As of August 2004, there were seventeen cities in Croatia which streets named after Budak<ref>To Kill a Nation: The Attack on Yugoslavia by Michael Parenti, published by Verso, 2002 ISBN 1859843662, 9781859843666 (page 45)</ref>. The archbishopric of Zagreb, declared at one point that it had no objection to the erection of a monument to the dead [[Usta<U+0161>e]]<ref>Democratic Transition in Croatia: Value Transformation, Education & Media By Sabrina P. Ramet, Davorka Mati<U+0107>, published by Texas A&M University Press, 2007 (page 17)</ref>. [[Croatian Radiotelevision]] aired a dramatization of Budak's autobiographical account of the 1915-16 Serb retreat through Albania. The official line was that Budak should be viewed as an important literary figure, independently of his controversial role in [[World War II]]. This caused reaction from the left-wing, liberal minority of the Croatian public, most notably ''[[Feral Tribune]]'', which launched a year's long campaign to have Budak-named streets renamed.

In 2003, [[Ivo Sanader]]'s government decided to finally deal with the issue which resulted in renaming all the streets bearing Budak's name save one; the Mile Budak street in [[Slavonski Brod]]. <ref>Meter: Pa Budakov je voza<U+010D> bio <U+017D>idov!
