'''''Odyssey Number Five''''' is the fourth [[studio album]] by Australian rock band [[Powderfinger]], produced by [[Nick DiDia]] and released on 4 September 2000. The album was the band's shortest yet, focusing on social, political, and emotional issues that had appeared in prior works, especially ''[[Internationalist (album)|Internationalist]]''.

The album produced four [[single (music)|singles]]. The most successful, "[[My Happiness (song)|My Happiness]]", reached #4 on the [[ARIA Singles Chart]], won the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2001|2001 ARIA Music Award]] for "Single of the Year", and topped [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2000|Triple J's Hottest 100]] in 2000. The album also featured "[[These Days (Powderfinger song)|These Days]]", which topped [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2000|Triple J's Hottest 100]] in 1999.

Many critics lauded the album as Powderfinger's best work; one stated that the album was "the Finger's Crowning Glory", however, others were critical of the "imitation" contained in the album. Overall, the album won five ARIA Music Awards in 2001 and was certified [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] seven times. ''Odyssey Number Five'' was Powderfinger's first album to chart in the United States, and the band toured extensively around North America to promote its release.

== Background, recording, and production ==
In a 1999 interview, Powderfinger [[bassist]] [[John Collins (musician)|John Collins]] hinted that the group's next album would be similar to their previous album, ''[[Internationalist (album)|Internationalist]]'',<ref>{{cite news|title=Keeping An Even Keel|publisher=Time Off Publications|author=Nicholson, Geoff|date=17 November 1999}}</ref> while [[frontman]] [[Bernard Fanning]] said in September 2000 that lyrics on the album, like those on "[[The Metre/Waiting for the Sun|Waiting for the Sun]]", were his "most personal and direct yet".<ref name=PCentral39 /> Fanning said his lyrics were based on the "obstacles in the way of being in a relationship, especially in our work situation".<ref name=PCentral39 />

Powderfinger worked with [[record producer|producer]] [[Nick DiDia]] on ''Odyssey Number Five'', as they had done on ''Internationalist'', finishing the album in August 2000 after six weeks of recording.<ref name=Jackets /> The band spent this time ensuring higher quality songs than on ''Internationalist'', which had featured out-of-tune guitars on "[[Passenger (Powderfinger song)|Passenger]]".<ref name=Jackets>{{cite news|title=Trusty Old Jackets|publisher=''Massive''|author=Yates, Rod|date=September 2000}}</ref><!-- re. the first FAC, in the source they admit to out of sync guitars -->

''Odyssey Number Five'' was Powderfinger's shortest album when recorded, running for approximately 45 minutes. The focus of the album centered on restraint, with more simplistic lyrics than previously, and with a plain and simple message intended.<ref name=PCentral39 /> Fanning said of his songwriting ethic: "You try and make it something that<U+2019>s got some substance, but also, you can never do that at the cost of it having relevance to what you<U+2019>re singing."<ref name=PCentral39 /> Powderfinger manager [[Paul Piticco]] commented that "their ethos is to be pushing the limits of their songwriting ability".<ref name=PCentral39>{{cite news|title=This Sporting Life|publisher=''Juice''|author=Wooldrige, Simon|date=September 2000}}</ref>

Like Powderfinger's previous album ''Internationalist'', ''Odyssey Number Five'' commented on [[sociology|social]] and [[politics|political]] issues heavily, with the primary point of focus being [[Indigenous Australians#Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal affairs]].<ref name=PCentral39 /> The lyrics of "[[Like a Dog]]" attacked former [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[John Howard]]'s [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] government for its treatment of [[Indigenous Australians]], and for breaking the "relaxed and comfortable" promise he made in the [[Australian federal election, 1996]].<ref name=Jackets /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22950641-16382,00.html |title=Time to be pragmatic|publisher=[[News.com.au]]|work=[[The Australian]]|date=20 December 2007|accessdate=6 January 2008|quote=In 1996, John Howard won by promising not a conservative revolution but to govern "for all of us" and to make Australians feel "relaxed and comfortable".}}</ref> Lead singer [[Bernard Fanning]] related this to the band's other ethical stances<U+2014>refusing to appear on ''[[Hey Hey it's Saturday]]'', for its anti-[[homosexual|gay]] commentary, or not allowing Powderfinger songs to be used in [[jingle]]s, amongst others<U+2014>stating, "We're not here to set an example. We just want to be happy with ourselves and not end up with a guilty conscience."<ref name="fiveeasypieces">{{cite news|title=Five Easy Pieces|publisher=''[[Sain (magazine)|Sain]]''|author=Eliszer, Christie|date=September 2000}}</ref> Fanning said that despite "Like a Dog" being about a political issue, it was not a political song, rather just Powderfinger "voicing our opinions".<ref name=Eskymag /> The band worked with boxer [[Anthony Mundine]] on the song's music video, whom Fanning praised as "the perfect lead, in terms of what the song is about and the fact that he<U+2019>s prepared to speak up for what he believes in."<ref name=Eskymag>{{cite news|title=Powderfinger 2001 - The Odyssey Continues|publisher=''Esky''|author=Munro, Kelsey|date=February 2001}}<!-- http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl28.htm --></ref>

As well as providing social commentary, ''Odyssey Number Five'' also discussed love, a recurring motif in Fanning's songwriting. Fanning noted that one of the causes of this was his passion for [[soul (music)|soul]] and [[gospel music]], stating that he "listen[s] to a lot of soul music that's unashamedly about love and how good it makes you feel".<ref name=SainUnlimited /> Lead guitarist [[Ian Haug]] agreed, and also noted that the band as a whole were fully committed to Fanning's lyrics, stating "It's really important for us to agree with what Bernard is singing."<ref name=SainUnlimited>{{cite news|title=Odyssey Number Five Is Born|publisher=''Sain Unlimited''|author=Dennison, Pennie|date=September 2000}}</ref>

''Odyssey Number Five'' marked Powderfinger's first successful attempt to enter the United States market. Fanning told ''[[Billboard.com|Billboard]]'' in a 2001 interview that the band were not taking anything for granted, however, stating, "In America, we haven't really done any work yet to deserve any major popularity",<ref name=BBinterview /> with the "vibes" on previous albums failing to reach the American mainstream.<ref name=RDW>{{cite news|title=Powderfinger Finds Their Bit Of Happiness|publisher=''[[Real Detroit Weekly]]''|author=McCarthy, Shannon|date=24 May 2001}}</ref> Powderfinger toured extensively around the country, performing in 22 cities. As a result of these efforts, "[[My Happiness (song)|My Happiness]]" was briefly placed on rotation on [[KROQ]] and several other [[radio station]]s. The song ultimately peaked at #23 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref name=BBinterview>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=919857 |title=Powderfinger Exports Its Aussie Appeal Stateside |publisher=[[Billboard.com]]|author=Jill Pesselnick|date=13 June 2001|accessdate=23 December 2007}}</ref><ref name=BBcharts>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Singles&model.vnuArtistId=171752&model.vnuAlbumId=469380 |title=Artist Chart History - Powderfinger|publisher=''[[Billboard.com|Billboard]]''|accessdate=23 December 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080220155414/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Singles&model.vnuArtistId=171752&model.vnuAlbumId=469380 |archivedate = February 20, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> This success was assisted by the band appearing on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', and by supporting [[Coldplay]] on tour.<ref name=PttP /> Guitarist [[Darren Middleton]] summarised their work in the United States by stating "This year has been a bit of a blur."<ref name=PttP>{{cite news|publisher=''RM Rave''|title=Powder to the People|author=Sawford, Gavin|date=12 July 2001}}<!-- http://www.ozmusic-central.com.au/powderfinger/text/articl41.htm --></ref>

''Odyssey Number Five'' was released on 4 September 2000, on the [[Grudge Records|Grudge]]/[[Universal Music Australia|Universal]] record labels. A similar version was released in the United Kingdom at a later date, while a sampler version was released in the United States in 2001, containing five tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powderfinger.com/site.php#releases |title=Discography |publisher=[[Powderfinger]] |accessdate=9 March 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080317060254/http://www.powderfinger.com/site.php#releases |archivedate = March 17, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004Z3BE/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top |title=Odyssey Number Five: Powderfinger|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=9 March 2008}}</ref>

Four [[single (music)|singles]] were released from the album. "[[My Kind of Scene]]" was the first; released as a [[promotional single]] in June 2000. The track was written for the 2000 film ''[[Mission: Impossible II]]'', and appeared on its [[Mission: Impossible II soundtrack|soundtrack]]. Collins and Middleton recalled that the song was written and produced with photos of [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Nicole Kidman]] on the wall of the band's studio "as inspiration". They noted that the band made three songs in response to the ''Mission: Impossible II'' request, and that "My Kind of Scene" was chosen over "Up & Down & Back Again" and "Whatever Makes You Happy".<ref name=Jackets />

The second single from the album was "[[My Happiness (song)|My Happiness]]", released on 14 August 2000 in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/My-Happiness-Powderfinger/dp/B00004W9QG |title=My Happiness: Powderfinger|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=8 March 2008}}</ref>  "My Happiness" entered the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Singles Chart]] at #4, and spent 24 weeks on the chart, making it Powderfinger's highest charting single in Australia.<ref name=AUSchartshome>{{cite web|url=http://www.australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Powderfinger |title=Discography - Powderfinger|publisher=australian-charts.com|accessdate=26 December 2007}}</ref> It peaked at #7 on the [[RIANZ|New Zealand singles chart]], and spent 23 weeks in the top 50. Furthermore, "My Happiness" was Powderfinger's first single to chart in the USA, reaching #23 on the  [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref name=BBcharts />

"[[Like a Dog]]" was released as the third single on 15 January 2001. The song was heavy in political sentiment, akin to "[[The Day You Come]]" on ''Internationalist''.<ref name=Eskymag /> The [[riff]] for the song was written by [[Ian Haug]], and the song's music video featured Australian Aboriginal [[boxing|boxer]] [[Anthony Mundine]], and was based on the 1980 [[Martin Scorsese]] film ''[[Raging Bull]]''. [[Drummer]] [[Jon Coghill]] said the song revolved around the question of "why the hell won<U+2019>t John Howard say sorry to the Aboriginal people!"<ref name=LikeADog>{{cite news|title=Powderfinger - Jon Coghill|author=Deegan, Ray|publisher=''Drum Scene''|date=[[November 2001|Nov 2001]] - [[January 2002|Jan 2002]]}}</ref> "Like a Dog" spent one week on the ARIA Singles Chart, at #40.<ref name=AUSchartshome />

Two songs from the album, "[[The Metre/Waiting for the Sun|The Metre]]" and "[[The Metre/Waiting for the Sun|Waiting for the Sun]]", were released as a double [[A-side]] to form the final single. The single was released on 21 August 2001, and included a cover of [[Iron Maiden]]'s "[[The Number of the Beast (song)|Number of the Beast]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Metre-Powderfinger/dp/B00005NQQ9 |title=Metre: Powderfinger|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=8 March 2008}}</ref> "Waiting for the Sun" was written by Fanning as a devotional, [[gospel]] style song. He said of the song; "It<U+2019>s about being in a relationship and being really heavily happy with it."<ref name=PCentral39 /> "The Metre" spent one week on the ARIA Singles Chart, at #31.<ref name=AUSchartshome />

== Reception ==
''Odyssey Number Five'' mostly gained positive reviews, and was more successful than its predecessor, ''Internationalist''. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reviewer Marc Weingarten gave the album a B+. He stated that album entered new "terrain" in guitar rock, complimenting the "scratching and clawing guitars", drawing comparisons to [[Travis (band)|Travis]] ("prim") and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] ("mock-grandiose").<ref name="ew">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,280590,00.html |title=Odyssey Number Five|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|author=Weingarten, Marc|date=30 March 2001|accessdate=6 January 2008}}</ref>

[[Allmusic]] reviewer Dean Carlson disliked the album, giving it a rating of one and a half stars. He described it as "little more than a slightly off-base perspective into the world of mid-90s American grunge", and described it as highly similar to [[Neil Young]].<ref name="amg-review" /> Carlson's only praise was for songs "Odyssey #5" and "[[My Happiness (song)|My Happiness]]", stating that "[t]oo often, Powderfinger is too earnest, a bit too careful in their career". Carlson noted that despite his critique, the album achieved some success in the American market.<ref name="amg-review">{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:fpfixqe0ldhe~T1|title=Odyssey Number Five > Review|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|author=Carlson, Dean|accessdate=23 December 2007}}</ref>

Devon Powers of ''[[PopMatters]]'' complimented Fanning's vocals, and said the focus of the album was "meaty, rolling ballads".<ref name="popmatters" /> Powers said that many of the songs on the album were "the kind of songs you put on repeat for hours, or days".<ref name="popmatters" /> The main critique was for the "faster numbers", stating that "[[Like a Dog]]" "sounds mostly a little bored".<ref name="popmatters" /> The review concluded by noting that the best songs on ''Odyssey'' were those not available as "fleeting radio singles and background music".<ref name="popmatters">{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/p/powderfinger-odyssey.shtml|title=Powderfinger: Odyssey #5|author=Powers, Devon|publisher=''[[PopMatters]]''|accessdate=22 December 2007}}</ref>

''Odyssey Number Five'' won the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2001|2001]] [[ARIA Awards]] for "Album of the Year", "Highest Selling Album", "Best Rock Album", "Best Cover Art", and "Best Group". "My Happiness" won the award for "Single of the Year", while "Like a Dog" was nominated for "Highest Selling Single" and "Best Video". At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2002|2002 ARIA Awards]], "The Metre" was nominated for "Best Group".<ref name=AAwards>{{cite web|url=http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history-by-artist.php?letter=P&artist=Powderfinger|title=History: Winners by Artist: Powderfinger|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association|accessdate=18 September 2007}}</ref> The album was named "Album of the Year" by ''[[Rolling Stone Australia]]'' readers, with "My Happiness" taking out "Song of the Year" and Powderfinger receiving "Band of the Year".<ref name=RSBOTY>{{cite news |title=Powderfinger - Band Of The Year|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone Australia]]''|author=Apter, Jeff|date=April 2001}}</ref>
