The '''1996 Manchester bombing''' was an attack carried out by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) on 15&nbsp;June 1996 in [[Manchester]], England.  The bomb, placed in the [[Manchester city centre|city centre]], targeted the city's infrastructure and economy and caused widespread damage, estimated by insurers at <U+00A3>700&nbsp;million (<U+00A3>{{formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|700000000|1996|r=-8}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}). Two hundred and twelve people were injured, but there were no fatalities.

In 1971 the IRA adopted a strategy of violence to achieve its aim of a [[united Ireland|reunification of Ireland]]. Although Manchester had been the target of IRA bombs before 1996, it had not been subjected to an attack on this scale: the largest device detonated in Great Britain during peacetime.<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|p=139}}</ref> The bombing was condemned by the British and Irish governments, along with [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Bill Clinton]]. Five days after the blast the IRA issued a statement in which it claimed responsibility, but regretted causing injury to civilians.

Several buildings close to the epicentre of the explosion had to be demolished, while many more were closed for months for structural repairs. Most of the rebuilding work was completed by the end of 1999, at a cost of <U+00A3>1.2&nbsp;billion, although redevelopment continued until 2005. At the time of the explosion Manchester was playing host to the [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro '96]] [[association football|football]] championships, with a match between Russia and Germany scheduled for the following day at [[Old Trafford]], and the city had the year before won its bid to host the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]].

==Background==

Ireland came under British rule at the end of the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]] in 1603, but was partitioned in 1921 under the terms of the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]].<ref>Northern Ireland became a distinct region of the United Kingdom, by [[Order in Council]] on 3 May 1921 (Statutory Rules & Orders published by authority (SR&O) 1921, No. 533).</ref> The [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) was formed from the remnants of the old [[Irish Republican Army]] between 1969 and 1971, with the aim of achieving the reunification of Ireland. The IRA used violence to achieve its aims until 1994, despite intermittent truces.<ref name="Coogan 365">{{harvnb|Coogan|2002|p=365}}</ref> The [[Downing Street Declaration]] of 1993 allowed [[Sinn F<U+00E9>in]], the IRA's political arm,<ref name="LA Times">{{citation |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-20/news/mn-16714_1_manchester-bombing |title=IRA Admits Manchester Bombing |publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' |date=20&nbsp;June 1996 |accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Coogan|2002|p=258.}}</ref> to participate in talks about the future of Northern Ireland on condition that it called a cease-fire. On 31&nbsp;August 1994, the IRA announced its "complete cessation of military operations", but that ended on 9&nbsp;February 1996, when it [[1996 Docklands bombing|detonated a bomb in Canary Wharf]], killing two people.<ref name="context: a quest for real peace">{{citation |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/special_reports/bomb/s/215/215648_context_a_quest_for_real_peace.html |title=Context: A quest for real peace |publisher=''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' |date=13&nbsp;June 2006 |accessdate=2009-09-10}}</ref> The IRA then planted five other devices in London within the space of 10&nbsp;weeks.<ref name="Huge explosion rocks central Manchester">{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/15/newsid_2527000/2527009.stm|title=1996: Huge explosion rocks central Manchester |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=|accessdate=2009-10-30}}</ref>

Manchester had been the target of earlier IRA bombs. A man was imprisoned for 15&nbsp;years in 1975 for placing two firebombs in Manchester city centre in 1973<U+2013>1974. In February 1974, a bomb exploded in Manchester Magistrates' Court, injuring twelve people. IRA bomb factories were discovered in [[Fallowfield]] and [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] and five men were imprisoned for planned attacks in [[North West England]].<ref name="context: a quest for real peace"/> Manchester may have been chosen because the city was one of the hosts for the [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro '96]] [[association football|football]] championships, attended by visitors and media organisations from all over Europe, guaranteeing the IRA what [[Margaret Thatcher]] called the "oxygen of publicity". A match between Russia and Germany was scheduled to take place at [[Old Trafford]] just over 24&nbsp;hours after the bomb exploded,<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|p=29}}</ref> and Manchester had the previous year won its bid to host the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]],<ref>{{citation |last=Rowbottom |first=Mike |title=Manchester Stadium Plan for 2002 Games |date=3&nbsp;May 1995 |newspaper=The Independent |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/manchester-stadium-plan-for-2002-games-1618038.html |accessdate=22&nbsp;February 2010}}</ref> the biggest multi-sport event ever to be staged in Britain.<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|p=183}}</ref>

==Details of the bombing==
===Discovery===

At about 9:20&nbsp;am on Saturday 15&nbsp;June 1996, a red and white [[Ford Cargo]] van was parked on Corporation Street, outside the [[Marks & Spencer]] store, close to the [[Manchester Arndale Centre|Arndale Centre]].<ref name="timeline"/> [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] footage shows the van abandoned on yellow lines by two hooded men. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal.<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|p=5}}</ref> At 9:43&nbsp;am [[Granada Television|Granada TV Studios]] received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. The caller had an Irish accent and gave a codeword so that police would know the threat was genuine.<ref name="timeline"/><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/16/world/bomb-believed-set-by-the-ira-leaves-200-hurt-in-british-city.html?pagewanted=all |title=Bomb Believed Set by the I.R.A.

The first policeman to arrive on the scene noticed wires running from the van's dashboard through a hole into the rear and reported that he had found the bomb. Forensic experts later estimated that the van contained a {{convert|3300|lb|kg|adj=on}} mixture of [[Semtex]] and [[ammonium nitrate]] fertiliser,<ref>{{Harvnb|Lesser|Hoffman|Arquilla|Ronfeldt|1999|p=29}}</ref> a cheap and easily obtainable explosive used extensively by the IRA.<ref>{{citation |last=Fleming |first=Nic |title=The Cheap and Easy Recipe for Bombs |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1458165/The-cheap-and-easy-recipe-for-bombs.html |date=31&nbsp;March 2004 |accessdate=22&nbsp;February 2010}}</ref> Components of what may have been a tremble trigger were also found later, designed to detonate the bomb if the van was tampered with.<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|p=6}}</ref>

===Evacuation===
At 10:00&nbsp;am, there were an estimated 75,000&ndash;80,000 people shopping and working in the vicinity.<ref name="timeline"/><ref>{{citation |first1=Graham |last1=Ball |first2=James |last2=Cusick |first3=Paul |last3=Routledge |first4=Stephen |last4=Castle |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/iras-message-in-blood-1337246.html |title=IRA's message in blood |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |date=16&nbsp;June 1996 |accessdate=2009-09-09}}</ref> The evacuation was undertaken by police officers from Bootle Street police station, supplemented by officers drafted into Manchester to control the football crowds. The police forces were helped by security guards from local shops. 

One group worked to move people away from the bomb while another, assisted by firefighters and security guards, established a continuously expanding cordon around the area to prevent entry.<ref name="timeline"/<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|pp=9<U+2013>10}}</ref> By 11:10&nbsp;am the cordon was at the maximum extent that available manpower would permit, about a quarter of a mile (0.40&nbsp;km) from the van and {{convert|1.5|mi}} in circumference.<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|p=11}}</ref>

===Explosion===
The [[bomb disposal|bomb squad]] arrived from their Liverpool base at 10:46&nbsp;am and attempted to defuse the bomb using a remote-controlled device, but they ran out of time. The bomb exploded at 11:17&nbsp;am, causing an estimated <U+00A3>700&nbsp;million (<U+00A3>{{formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|700000000|1996|r=-8}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}){{Inflation-fn|UK}} of damage and affecting a third of the city centre's retail space.

A search of the area for casualties was confused by [[mannequin]]s blasted from shop windows, which were sometimes mistaken for bodies. Hospitals across Greater Manchester were made ready to receive those injured in the blast.<ref name="timeline"/> The police commandeered a [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] tram to take 50 of the casualties to [[North Manchester General Hospital]], which treated 79 in total; a further 80 were cared for at the [[Manchester Royal Infirmary]], and many others were treated in the streets by ambulance crews assisted by doctors and nurses who happened to be in the city centre that morning.<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|pp=21<U+2013>22}}</ref>

==Reaction==
The bombing was condemned by [[John Major]]'s government, the opposition, and by individual [[Members of Parliament]] (MPs) as a "sickening", "callous" and "barbaric" terrorist attack.<ref>{{citation |title=Major blasts 'barbaric bombers' |publisher=''[[Lancashire Evening Telegraph]]'' |date=17&nbsp;June 1996 |url=http://archive.thisislancashire.co.uk/1996/6/17/850834.html |accessdate=2006-12-24}}</ref><ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo960619/debtext/60619-38.htm House of Commons Hansard Debate for 19 Jun 1996 (pt. 38)], publications.parliament.uk.

In an effort to allay fears that Manchester's considerable Irish community might be subjected to reprisal attacks, Councillors [[Richard Leese]] and Martin Pagel{{ndash}} leader and deputy leader of [[Manchester City Council]] respectively{{ndash}} made a public visit to the Irish World Heritage Centre in [[Cheetham Hill]]. In the event there were only a few incidents, the most serious of which occurred on the evening of the bomb when a gang of 10&nbsp;men rampaged through an Irish-themed bar in the centre of [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]] shouting "No Surrender" and smashing furniture and windows.<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|pp=41<U+2013>44}}</ref> Seven days after the explosion Manchester Council held a family fun day in front of the [[Manchester Town Hall|Town Hall]] in [[Albert Square, Manchester|Albert Square]] to encourage shoppers and visitors back into the city centre, the first of a "series of events and entertainments".<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|p=49}}</ref> The scheduled Euro '96 football match between Russia and Germany at Old Trafford on the day following the bombing went ahead as planned after the stadium had been heavily guarded overnight and carefully searched; the game, in which Germany beat Russia 3<U+2013>0, was watched by a capacity crowd of 50,700.<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|p=52}}</ref>

==Investigation==
In an effort to trace the route of the Ford Cargo van, police examined [[CCTV]] footage from every major road and motorway taken in England within two days of the bombing. Footage revealed that the van was driven south along the [[M1 motorway]] into London on the Friday afternoon before the attack. It was seen again heading north along the motorway at 7:40&nbsp;pm, accompanied by a [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Ford Granada]]. Detectives surmised that the van had been loaded with explosives in London and that the Granada was intended to be the getaway vehicle. The van was last recorded travelling east along the [[M62 motorway]] towards Manchester at 8:31&nbsp;am on the morning of the explosion.<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|pp=65<U+2013>66}}</ref>

Police in Manchester were aware that their Metropolitan Police colleagues in London were investigating a suspected IRA unit based in the capital, and wondered whether the London unit was responsible for the Manchester bombing. On 15&nbsp;July, Metropolitan police arrested six men suspected IRA membership: Donal Gannon, John Crawley, Gerard Hanratty, Robert Morrow, Patrick Martin, and Francis Rafferty. Each was tried and convicted of "conspiracy to cause explosions at National Grid electricity stations", and sentenced to 35&nbsp;years in jail.<ref name=KingP67>{{Harvnb|King|2006|p=67}}</ref><ref>{{citation|work=The Independent|title=IRA team who planned terror blitz on capital given 35 years|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/ira-team-who-planned-terror-blitz-on-capital-given-35-years-1248661.html|first1=Michael|last1=Streeter|first2=Steve|last2= Boggan|date=3 July 1997}}</ref> Police in Manchester meanwhile worked to establish if the men were also responsible for the Manchester bomb.<ref name=KingP67/>

Their investigation was led by Detective Chief Inspector Gordon Mutch of the [[Greater Manchester Police]] (GMP), "astonishingly ... the only person ever charged with a criminal offence in connection with the Manchester bomb".<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|p=163}}</ref> The van's last registered owner told police that he had sold it to a dealer in [[Peterborough]], who had in turn sold the van on to a man calling himself Tom Fox, two weeks before the bombing. After the purchase price was delivered in cash by a taxi driver, the dealer was instructed to take the van to a nearby lorry park, and leave it there with the keys and documents hidden inside. 

On checking records of telephone calls made to the dealer, the police discovered that some had been made from a mobile phone registered in Ireland, and on further checking the records of that phone it appeared that the calls were made from locations consistent with the known whereabouts of the Ford van.{{Clarify|date=March 2010}} One call was to a known IRA member. The phone was last used at 9:23&nbsp;am on the morning of the bombing, just three minutes after the bombers had positioned their van in Corporation Street. On 27&nbsp;June, the phone's registered owner reported that it had been stolen 17&nbsp;days earlier, but the police felt they had gathered enough evidence to bring a prosecution against the six IRA men held in London.<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|pp=67<U+2013>69}}</ref>

At a meeting attended by the commander of Special Branch in Manchester, a GMP assistant chief constable and a "senior officer" from the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]], it was decided, for reasons never made public, not to present the findings of the investigation to the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] (CPS); the body responsible for undertaking criminal prosecutions in England. The three may have felt that as the IRA suspects were already in police custody they had ceased to be a threat, or that to pursue the case against them may have jeopardised ongoing undercover operations. It was not until 1998 that the police finally sent their file to the CPS, who decided not to prosecute.<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|pp=69<U+2013>71}}</ref>

==Leak==
Early in 1999, Steve Panter, chief crime reporter for the ''Manchester Evening News'', was leaked classified [[Special Branch]] documents naming those suspected of the bombing. The documents also revealed that the man suspected of organising the attack had visited Manchester shortly after the explosion and been under covert police surveillance as he toured the devastated city centre before returning to his home in [[County Armagh|South Armagh]].<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|pp=163<U+2013>164}}</ref> Suspicion fell on Mutch as the source of the leaked documents after an analysis of mobile phone records placed both him and Panter at the same hotel in [[Skipton]], Yorkshire, about {{convert|40|mi}} from Manchester on the same evening.<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|pp=166<U+2013>167}}</ref>

On 21 April 1999, the ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'' named a man it described as "a prime suspect in the 1996 Manchester bomb plot".<ref>{{citation |title=We name Manchester bomb suspect |first=Steve |last=Panter |date=21&nbsp;April 1999 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News}}</ref> The newspaper reported that the file sent by Greater Manchester Police to the Crown Prosecution Service contained the sentence: "It is the opinion of the investigating officers of GMP that there is sufficient evidence to charge [him] with being a party in a conspiracy to cause explosions in the United Kingdom."<ref>{{citation |title=Senior officers wanted the arrest of suspect |date=21&nbsp;April 1999 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News}}</ref>  The man denied any involvement.<ref name="MEN210599">{{citation |last=Craig |first=Ian |title=We named the right suspect - Why we didn't prosecute McCann, by attorney general |date=21&nbsp;May 1999 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News}}</ref>  The Attorney General wrote in a letter to a local MP that the advice given to the CPS by an independent lawyer was that "there was not a case to answer on the evidence available ... a judge would stop the case": the Attorney General further wrote that the decision not to prosecute was not influenced by the government.  The newspaper also identified the six men arrested in London on 15&nbsp;July as having planned the attack.<ref>{{citation|title=Mobile phone calls that plotted a trail to terror |date=21&nbsp;April 1999 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News}}</ref><ref>{{citation |title=How cash lost in post linked gang with bomb|author=Andrew Nott|date=28 July 2000|newspaper=Manchester Evening News}}</ref> By July 2000 all six had been released under the terms of Belfast Agreement of 1998.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lester|Panter|2006|p=43}}</ref>
 
As of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, Panter and Mutch are the only people to have been arrested in connection with the bombing. Mutch was tried for "misconduct in a public office" during an 11-day trial held in January 2002, but was acquitted. During the trial Panter was found in contempt of court for refusing to reveal his source,<ref>{{Harvnb|Lester|Panter|2006|pp=46<U+2013>77}}</ref> an offence that is punishable by a term of imprisonment without the right of appeal.<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|p=171}}</ref> Greater Manchester Police announced in 2006 that there was no realistic chance of convicting those responsible for the bombing.<ref>{{citation |last=Atkins |first=Rebecca |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/5071916.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |title=Manchester bombers escape trial |date=15&nbsp;June 2006 |accessdate=27&nbsp;April 2009}}</ref>

The glass domes of the Corn Exchange and the Royal Exchange were blown in.

The possibility of taking the opportunity to rebuild parts of the city centre was raised within days of the bomb.  On 26 June 1996, [[Michael Heseltine]], the Deputy Prime Minister, announced an international competition for designs of the redevelopment of the bomb-affected area. Bids were received from 27&nbsp;entrants, 5 of whom were invited to submit designs in a second round.<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|pp=129<U+2013>30, 143}}</ref>  It was announced on 5&nbsp;November 1996 that the winning design was one by a consortium headed by EDAW.<ref>{{Harvnb|Williams|2003|p=108}}</ref>

==Redevelopment==
Much of the 1960s redevelopment of Manchester's city centre was unpopular with residents. Market Street, close to the explosion and at that time the second busiest shopping street in the UK, was considered by some commentators a "fearful" place, to be "avoid[ed] like the plague".<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson-Bailey|2002|p=222}}</ref> Until [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s third consecutive election victory in 1987, the staunchly [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour-controlled]] Manchester Council believed that Manchester's regeneration should be funded solely by public money, despite the government's insistence on only funding schemes with a significant element of private investment. [[Graham Stringer]], leader of Manchester City Council, later admitted that after the 1987 General Election result "there was no get out of jail card. We had gambled on Labour winning the General Election and we lost."<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|pp=84<U+2013>85}}</ref> Thatcher's victory effectively put paid to Manchester's "socialist experiment", and Stringer shortly afterwards wrote a letter of capitulation to [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]], then [[Secretary of State for the Environment]], saying, "in a nutshell; OK, you win, we'd like to work together with you".<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|p=85}}</ref>

Efforts at improvement before the bombing had in some respects made matters worse, cutting off the area north of the Arndale Centre{{ndash}} the exterior of which was widely unloved{{ndash}} from the rest of the city centre. A large building nearby, now redeveloped as [[The Printworks]] and formerly occupied by the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' newspaper, had been unoccupied since 1987.<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|p=181}}</ref> Many locals therefore considered that "the bomb was the best thing that ever happened to Manchester",<ref>{{citation |last=Eaton |first=Andrew |title=City of Dreams |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=12&nbsp;April 2008 |url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=121E124FB7385E28&p_docnum=1&p_queryname=5 |format=subscription required |accessdate=2&nbsp;March 2010}}</ref> as it cleared the way for redevelopment of the dysfunctional city centre, a view also expressed in 2007 by [[Terry Rooney]], MP for [[Bradford North (UK Parliament constituency)|Bradford North]]. The leader of Manchester City Council, Simon Ashley, responded that "I take exception to his [Rooney's] comments about the IRA bomb. No one who was in the city on that day, who lost their jobs or was scared witless or injured by the blast, would say the bomb was the best thing to happen to Manchester".<ref name="Labour MP gaffe">{{citation |title=Labour MP in IRA bomb gaffe |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=15&nbsp;March 2007 |accessdate=2&nbsp;March 2010 |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1001/1001912_labour_mp_in_ira_bomb_gaffe.html}}</ref>  Sir [[Gerald Kaufman]], MP for [[Manchester Gorton (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester Gorton]], stated that the bomb provided the opportunity for redeveloping Manchester city centre, although it was not fully exploited. "The bomb was obviously bad but from a redevelopment point of view, it was a lost opportunity. While the area around St Ann's Square and Deansgate is not disagreeable, if you compare it with Birmingham and its exciting development, we've got nothing to touch that in Manchester".<ref name="Labour MP gaffe"/> Howard Bernstein, Chief Executive of Manchester City Council, has been quoted as saying "people say the bomb turned out to be a great thing for Manchester. That's rubbish."<ref>{{Harvnb|Lester|Panter|2002|p=80}}</ref> There was already substantial regeneration and redevelopment taking place in Manchester before the bombing, in support of the city's [[bids for the 2000 Summer Olympics|bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games]], its second Olympic bid. [[Tom Bloxham]], chairman of property development group [[Urban Splash]] and of the Arts Council England (North West) agreed with Bernstein that the bomb attack was not the trigger for the large-scale redevelopment that has taken place in Manchester since the early 1990s:

{{quote|For me the turning point for Manchester came before the bomb&nbsp;... it was the second Olympic Games bid [in 1992] when we lost but the city suddenly had a realisation. There was a huge party in Castlefield and people grasped the idea that Manchester should no longer consider itself in competition with the likes of Barnsley and Stockport. It was now up against Barcelona, Los Angeles and Sydney and its aspirations increased accordingly.<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|p=218}}</ref>}}

==Memorials==
A [[pillar box]] that survived the blast despite being yards from the explosion, now carries a small brass plaque recording the bombing. It was removed during construction and redevelopment work, and returned to its original spot when Corporation Street reopened.<ref>{{Harvnb|King|2006|pp=148<U+2013>149}}</ref>

A [[Thanksgiving]] service for the "Miracle of Manchester" was held at Manchester Cathedral on 24&nbsp;July 2002, to coincide with the arrival of the [[2002 Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]] baton, attended by [[Elizabeth II of England|Queen Elizabeth]] and [[Prince Philip]]. At 11:17&nbsp;am on 15&nbsp;June 2006, a candle was lit at a memorial held at [[Manchester Cathedral]] to mark the tenth anniversary of the bombing.<ref>{{citation |title=Memorial service marks 1996 bomb |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=15&nbsp;June 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/5083024.stm |accessdate=18&nbsp;December 2007}}</ref>
