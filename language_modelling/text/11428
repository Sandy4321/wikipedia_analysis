'''Linghu Tao''' (<U+4EE4><U+72D0><U+7DAF>), [[courtesy name]] '''Zizhi''' (<U+5B50><U+76F4>), formally the '''Duke of Zhao''' (<U+8D99><U+516C>), was an official of the [[History of China|Chinese]] dynasty [[Tang Dynasty]].  He was the leading [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]] during the last nine years of the reign of [[Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong of Tang|Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong]], but was removed from his chancellor position after Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong's death, subsequently serving several terms as military governor (''[[Jiedushi]]'') in the circuits.

==Background and early career==
It is not known when Linghu Tao was born.  He was probably the second son of [[Linghu Chu]],<ref name=ZZTJ248>''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:<U+8CC7><U+6CBB><U+901A><U+9451>/<U+5377>248|vol. 248]].</ref> who was a prominent official under several emperors, including serving as [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]] during the reign of [[Emperor Xianzong of Tang|Emperor Xianzong]], and Linghu Tao had an older brother named Linghu Xu (<U+4EE4><U+72D0><U+7DD2>).<ref name=BT172>''[[Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:<U+820A><U+5510><U+66F8>/<U+5377>172|vol. 172]].</ref>

Linghu Tao passed the [[imperial examination]]s in the ''Jinshi'' class in 830, during the reign of Emperor Xianzong's grandson [[Emperor Wenzong of Tang|Emperor Wenzong]].  He was thereafter made a copyeditor at Hongwen Pavilion (<U+5F18><U+6587><U+9928>).  Early in Emperor Wenzong's ''Kaifeng'' era (836-840), he served as ''Zuo Shiyi'' (<U+5DE6><U+62FE><U+907A>), a low-level advisory official at the examination bureau of government (<U+9580><U+4E0B><U+7701>, ''Menxia Sheng'').  When Linghu Chu died in 837, he left governmental service to observe a period of mourning.  After the period was over, he was given his old office back, and then promoted to ''Zuo Bujue'' (<U+5DE6><U+88DC><U+95D5>) and also made an editor of imperial histories.  He later was made ''Kubu Yuanwailang'' (<U+5EAB><U+90E8><U+54E1><U+5916><U+90CE>) and then ''Hubu Yuanwailang'' (<U+6236><U+90E8><U+54E1><U+5916><U+90CE>), both low-level offices at the ministry of census (<U+6236><U+90E8>, ''Hubu'').  In 845, during the reign of Emperor Wenzong's brother [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]], he was sent out of the capital [[Chang'an]] to serve as the prefect of Hu Prefecture (<U+6E56><U+5DDE>, in modern [[Huzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]).<ref name=BT172/>

==During Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong's reign==
===Before chancellorship===
In 847 or 848, when Emperor Wuzong's uncle (Emperor Xianzong's younger son) [[Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong of Tang|Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong]] was emperor, there was an occasion when Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong was recalling the events at Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong's funeral with the chancellor [[Bai Minzhong]].  Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong stated that he remembered an official who, during a storm during the funeral procession, held onto Emperor Xianzong's casket and did not let go even as everyone else was scattering, and Bai stated that it was Linghu Chu.  When Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong then asked whether Linghu Chu had sons and whether the sons had capability to be chancellor, Bai mentioned Linghu Xu and Linghu Tao, and further opined that Linghu Xu had long been debilitated by [[arthritis]], but that Linghu Tao was capable.  Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong then promoted LInghu Chu to be ''Kaogong Langzhong'' (<U+8003><U+529F><U+90CE><U+4E2D>, a supervisory official at the ministry of civil service affairs (<U+540F><U+90E8>, ''Libu'')) and put him in charge of drafting edicts.  When Linghu Tao met with Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong to thank him, Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong further asked him about the events during Emperor Xianzong's reign; Linghu was able to recount them in detail.  This pleased Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong, who began to consider him for even higher promotions.<ref name=ZZTJ248/><ref name=BT172/><ref name=NBT166>''[[New Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:<U+65B0><U+5510><U+66F8>/<U+5377>166|vol. 166]].</ref>

In 848, Linghu was made an imperial scholar (<U+7FF0><U+6797><U+5B78><U+58EB>, ''Hanlin Xueshi'').  There was an occasion when Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong was asking Linghu to read him what Linghu would consider to be the key part of the ''Golden Mirror'' (<U+91D1><U+93E1>) <U+2014> a work authored by Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong's distinguished ancestor [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]] <U+2014> when Linghu read, "If the state is in confusion, it is not necessarily not the case that you have commissioned those who are inappropriate; if the state is being governed well, it is not necessarily not the case that you have commissioned those who are faithful and wise."  Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong approved of this selection greatly.<ref name=ZZTJ248/><ref name=NBT166/>  In 849, Linghu was made ''Zhongshu Sheren'' (<U+4E2D><U+66F8><U+820D><U+4EBA>), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau (<U+4E2D><U+66F8><U+7701>, ''Zhongshu Sheng'') and created the Baron of Pengyang, and soon thereafter made deputy chief imperial censor (<U+5FA1><U+53F2><U+4E2D><U+4E1E>, ''Yushi Zhongcheng'').  In 850, he was made the deputy minister of census (<U+6236><U+90E8><U+4F8D><U+90CE>) and put in charge of tax collection.<ref name=BT172/>

===Chancellorship===
Also in 850, by which time Linghu Tao was referred to as deputy minister of defense (<U+5175><U+90E8><U+4F8D><U+90CE>, ''Bingbu Shilang'') as well as chief imperial scholar (<U+7FF0><U+6797><U+5B78><U+58EB><U+627F><U+6B62>, ''Hanlin Xueshi Chengzhi''), he made a chancellor ''de facto'' with the designation ''Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi'' (<U+540C><U+4E2D><U+66F8><U+9580><U+4E0B><U+5E73><U+7AE0><U+4E8B>).<ref name=ZZTJ249>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:<U+8CC7><U+6CBB><U+901A><U+9451>/<U+5377>249|vol. 249]].</ref>  For the next nine years, Linghu would serve as, in effect, the leading chancellor.<ref name=BT172/>  At one point, Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong, who was considered a relatively forceful emperor, discussed with Linghu the possibility of slaughtering the [[eunuch (court official)|eunuch]]s, whose control over imperial governance had grown over the years.  Linghu feared that a general slaughter would victimize the innocent as well as the guilty, and therefore instead advocated, in a secret report to Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong, that he should instead eliminate the eunuchs by attrition <U+2014> by punishing those who were guilty and by not replenishing their ranks.  When the eunuchs became aware of this report, however, they were nevertheless resentful of Linghu and the other officials that they considered to be behind the report.<ref name=ZZTJ249/>

In 857, Linghu's chancellor colleague [[Wei Mo]] was removed from his chancellor position and made the military governor (''[[Jiedushi]]'') of Xichuan Circuit (<U+897F><U+5DDD>, headquartered in modern [[Chengdu]], [[Sichuan]]), purportedly because Wei was strict and blunt, causing apprehension by Linghu.<ref name=ZZTJ249/>

In 858, there was an occasion when Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong wanted to declare a general pardon, which Linghu opposed on the basis of the expense involved (as general pardons customarily required bestowing of rewards to imperial guard soldiers<ref>''[[Bo Yang]] Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian'', vol. 60 [858].</ref>) and that the state should not have repeated pardons without good reasons.<ref name=ZZTJ249/>  (Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong had previously declared general pardons four times in his reign <U+2014> in 847, 848, 850, and 853.<ref name=ZZTJ248/><ref name=ZZTJ249/>)  When Linghu's colleague [[Cui Shenyou]] subsequently suggested that if Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong created one of his sons [[Crown Prince]] that that would be a good reason to declare a general pardon, Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong, who did not want to create a crown prince, was displeased with Cui and subsequently removed Cui from his chancellor position, but nothing occurred to Linghu.  Still, Linghu, despite his lengthy service under Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong, was continuously apprehensive of the emperor's strictness as well.  On one occasion, when Linghu violated Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong's order that when prefectural prefects who were being transferred from one prefecture to another, the prefect were to come to Chang'an so that Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong could personally review their reports, Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong made sarcastic remarks that the chancellor had abrogated imperial orders, but carried out no negative actions against Linghu.<ref name=ZZTJ249/>

During Linghu's term as chancellor, his sons Linghu Hao (<U+4EE4><U+72D0><U+6EC8>), Linghu Huan (<U+4EE4><U+72D0><U+6E19>), and Linghu Feng (<U+4EE4><U+72D0><U+6E22>), in order to avoid appearances of favoritism, did not submit themselves for imperial examinations.  Still, Linghu Hao, in particular, developed a reputation for living luxuriously, receiving bribes, and influencing his father's governance, particularly because he was also related by marriage to the influential imperial scholar Zheng Hao (<U+912D><U+9865>), who was Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong's son-in-law.  It was said that because of this, the officials and the people had much resentment for Linghu Tao as well.  By the end of Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong's reign, Linghu was also, in addition to being chancellor, minister of civil service affairs (<U+540F><U+90E8><U+5C1A><U+66F8>, ''Libu Shangshu''), ''You Pushe'' (<U+53F3><U+50D5><U+5C04>, one of the heads of the executive bureau (<U+5C1A><U+66F8><U+7701>, ''Shangshu Sheng'')), and the Duke of Liang.<ref name=BT172/><ref>That Linghu was the Duke of Liang by the end of Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong's reign was per his biography in the ''Book of Tang''.  According to his biography in the ''New Book of Tang'', he was not created the Duke of Liang until during Emperor Yizong's reign, when he contributed to shipping supplies to the troops fighting a campaign against local natives and [[Kingdom of Nanzhao|Nanzhao]] forces.  Compare ''Book of Tang'', vol. 172 with ''New Book of Tang'', vol. 166.</ref>

==During Emperor Yizong's reign==
Emperor Xu<U+0101>nzong died in 859 and was succeeded by his son [[Emperor Yizong of Tang|Emperor Yizong]]; during the brief mourning period, Linghu Tao served as [[regent]].  Later in the year, with many officials having resented Linghu for his long hold on power and Linghu Hao's lifestyle, there were many accusations against Linghu Tao.  As a result, Linghu was removed from his chancellor position and sent to Hezhong Circuit (<U+6CB3><U+4E2D>, headquartered in modern [[Yuncheng, Shanxi]]) to serve as its military governor, continuing to carry the ''Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi'' title as an honorary title;<ref name=ZZTJ249/> he was also made the mayor of Hezhong's capital Hezhong Municipality.  In 861, he was made the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (<U+5BA3><U+6B66>, headquartered in modern [[Kaifeng]], [[Henan]]), as well as the prefect of its capital Bian Prefecture (<U+6C74><U+5DDE>).  In 862, he was made the deputy military governor of Huainan Circuit (<U+6DEE><U+5357>, headquartered in modern [[Yangzhou]], acting as military governor.<ref name=BT172/>

In 863, Linghu Hao had, after finally submitting himself for imperial examinations and passed in the ''Jinshi'' class, been made ''Zuo Shiyi'' (<U+5DE6><U+62FE><U+907A>) <U+2014> which led to many objections by advisory officials, pointing out Linghu Hao's misdeeds while Linghu Tao was chancellor.  Linghu Hao, in fear, declined the position and was made an assistant to the Crown Prince's head of household.<ref name=ZZTJ250>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:<U+8CC7><U+6CBB><U+901A><U+9451>/<U+5377>250|vol. 250]].</ref><ref>However, as there was no crown prince at the time, the post was entirely honorary.</ref>  In 864, Linghu Tao submitted a petition defending Linghu Hao; as a result, Emperor Yizong demoted two of the officials who were harshest in their criticism against Linghu Hao, Zhang Yun (<U+5F35><U+96F2>) and Liu Shui (<U+5289><U+86FB>).<ref name=ZZTJ250/>

In 868, expeditionary soldiers sent from Xusi Circuit (<U+5F90><U+6CD7>, headquartered in modern [[Xuzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]) to help defend the border with Nanzhao at Gui Prefecture (<U+6842><U+5DDE>, in modern [[Guilin]], [[Guangxi]]), angry that they had been stationed there for four years (one more year past the originally promised term of three years) and were set to be stationed there for yet another year, mutinied under the leadership of the officer [[Pang Xun]] and headed back toward Xusi.  As they passed through Linghu's Huainan Circuit, Linghu placated them by supplying them with food, despite suggestions by his officer Li Xiang (<U+674E><U+6E58>) that he should attack and destroy them, as Linghu only wanted them to spare Huainan.  Subsequently, when the mutineers openly rebelled and attacked Xusi's prefectures, including capturing the capital Xu Prefecture (<U+5F90><U+5DDE>) and putting Si Prefecture (<U+6CD7><U+5DDE>, in modern [[Huai'an]], [[Jiangsu]]) under siege, Emperor Yizong ordered Huainan troops to help relieve Si Prefecture.  Linghu sent troops, with Li commanding them, along with the eunuch monitor Guo Houben (<U+90ED><U+539A><U+672C>).  The Xusi mutineers, however, defeated the Huainan troops and captured most of them, including Li and Guo, whose hands and feet they cut off.  Linghu was able to buy some time to recover by convincing Pang that he was going to request that Emperor Yizong pardon and officially commission Pang.<ref name=ZZTJ251>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:<U+8CC7><U+6CBB><U+901A><U+9451>/<U+5377>251|vol. 251]].</ref>  Still, given his defeat, he was soon replaced by Ma Ju (<U+99AC><U+8209>).<ref name=BT172/>  He was given the honorary title of ''Taibao'' (<U+592A><U+4FDD>) but with his office at the eastern capital [[Luoyang]].<ref name=ZZTJ251/>

==During Emperor Xizong's reign==
In 875, by which time Emperor Yizong's son [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Emperor Xizong]] was emperor, Linghu Tao was made the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (<U+9CF3><U+7FD4>, headquartered in modern [[Baoji]], [[Shaanxi]]), and the mayor of its capital Fengxiang Municipality.<ref name=ZZTJ252>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:<U+8CC7><U+6CBB><U+901A><U+9451>/<U+5377>252|vol. 252]].</ref>  He was also created the Duke of Zhao, and reconferred the ''Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi'' title as an honorary title.<ref name=BT172/>  In 876, with the Tang governmental troops deeply engaged against the agrarian rebels under [[Wang Xianzhi]] and [[Huang Chao]], Emperor Yizong had Linghu and Li Kan (<U+674E><U+4F83>) the military governor of Binning Circuit (<U+90A0><U+5BE7>, headquartered in modern [[Xianyang]], [[Shaanxi]]), select 1,000 infantry soldiers and 500 cavalry soldiers to help defend [[Tong Pass]] against a possible attack by the agrarian rebels.<ref name=ZZTJ252/>  That was the last historical record of an act by Linghu, who died while still serving at Fengxiang Circuit, at the age of 77, and was given posthumous honors, but the year was not known.<ref name=NBT166/>
