==History==
The [[particular church]] that became the Diocese of Grass Valley was erected in 1860 as the [[Vicariate Apostolic]] of [[Marysville, California|Marysville]] from territory formerly belonging to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco|Archdiocese of San Francisco]], of which it was a [[suffragan see]].<ref name="c-h diocese">{{catholic-hierarchy|diocese|dg009|Diocese of Grass Valley|August 28, 2007}}</ref> In 1868, the [[see city]] was changed to [[Grass Valley, California|Grass Valley]], and the vicariate was renamed and elevated to a diocese.<ref name="sac about">{{cite web | url=http://www.diocese-sacramento.org/diocese/about.html | title=About the diocese | publisher=[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sacramento]] | accessdate=2007-08-28 }}</ref>

[[St. Joseph Church, Marysville|St. Joseph Church]] in Marysville served as the [[pro-cathedral]] of the vicarate. When the vicarate was elevated to a diocese, [[Eugene O'Connell|Bishop Eugene O'Connell]] resisted the change of see city to Grass Valley, and continued using St. Joseph's as his pro-cathedral. [[St. Patrick Church, Grass Valley|St. Patrick Cathedral]] in Grass Valley was the official [[cathedral]] approved by [[Holy See|the Vatican]].<ref name="Cathedrals of California">{{cite web | url=http://www.cathedralsofcalifornia.com?p=136 | title=The Forgotten Diocese and the Spurned Cathedral | work=Cathedrals of California | author=Eric Stoltz | date=January 31, 2008 | accessdate=2008-01-31 }}</ref>

The diocese served the large mining population in the [[Sierra Nevada (United States)|Sierra Nevada]] during the [[California Gold Rush]]. By 1886, commercial mining in the [[Gold Country]] had slowed considerably, significantly reducing the population in the area, and the diocese was suppressed. Much of its territory became part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sacramento|Diocese of Sacramento]]. O<U+2019>Connell is considered the first bishop of Sacramento.<ref>[http://www.diocese-sacramento.org/diocese/lineage_bishops.html#oconnell ''Lineage of Bishops''] Retrieved: 2010-03-24.</ref><ref>{{citation |author=Jennifer Garza |newspaper=Sacramento Bee |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2010/02/08/2520540/bishop-gallegos-body-will-be-moved.html |title=Bishop Gallegos' body will be moved in bid for sainthood |date=February 8, 2010 |accessdate=March 24, 2010}}</ref>
