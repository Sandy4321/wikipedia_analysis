'''myki''' (pronounced {{IPAEng|<U+02C8>ma<U+026A>ki<U+02D0>}}) is the name of the [[contactless smartcard]] ticketing system to be introduced on [[public transport]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. myki is designed to replace a number of ticket systems in Victoria, primarily the current [[Metcard]] (metropolitan Melbourne) and V/Line (regional) ticketing systems. 

myki will also operate on local bus services in many regional centres, including Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, Moe, Morwell, Traralgon, and Warrnambool. The [[Skybus Super Shuttle]] [[Melbourne Airport]] service (with its own, premium fares) will also accept myki. The myki system is being provided by Kamco (Keane Australia Micropayment Consortium), a wholly owned subsidiary of the American company [[Keane (company)|Keane Inc]].<ref>[http://www.keane.com/about_keane/news_room/press_releases_1478.htm Keane - ''Victoria<U+2019>s Transport Ticketing Authority Selects Keane to Deliver Us$367 Million Next-Generation Ticketing System'' - July 12, 2005]</ref>

The first field trial of myki was held on the [[Geelong Transit System|Geelong bus network]] in late 2007. The trial identified problems with "front office" computer software.<ref name="THR">[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/citys-500m-ticket-chaos/2008/03/01/1204227055164.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 The Age: ''Passengers face $500m ticket chaos'' - 2 March 2008]</ref> In May 2008 Kamco conducted Regional Bus Pilot 1 in Geelong, where ninety percent of tests were passed. According to Kamco's report on Regional Bus Pilot 1, it demonstrated "Essential onbus activities such as scan on and scan off, top up myki, purchase of short-term tickets using cash or myki money, driver log on / off, route and shift selection and GPS connectivity and accuracy performed well. Back office processes and operational procedures such as end-to-end data transaction flows, generation of reports, training, communications, installation and commissioning were generally good. The operator ([[McHarry's Buslines]]) was pleased with the NTS training, performance and ease of use of the myki solution." Further field tests across other transport modes during the second half of 2008, including an additional test on regional buses were planned. <ref>[http://www.transport.vic.gov.au/DOI/DOIElect.nsf/$UNIDS+for+Web+Display/9583D8C7771641C2CA25746C00280B32/$FILE/Regional%20Bus%20Pilot%201%20_RBP1_%20Summary%20Report.pdf Regional Bus Pilot 1 (RBP1) Summary Report] </ref>

== Usage ==
[[Image:myki-fpd.jpg|thumb|Trial myki fare payment device installed into a bus in [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]]]]

myki gives customers the best fare for the way they travel and fares will continue to be based on the time-zone fares currently used under the Metcard system. myki will store monetary value (myki money) and travel days (myki pass). myki money calculates the best fare for the user's trip as they scan on and scan off throughout the system and caps to the applicable 2 hour, daily or weekly (Monday - Sunday) fare.

myki will be able to be purchased from:
* myki machines at all Connex train stations, various V/Line stations tram super stops and selected bus interchanges
* the Internet ([http://www.myki.com.au www.myki.com.au])
* myki info line
* network of retail outlets, mainly [[7-Eleven]]<ref name="hun-agent">[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23000129-661,00.html Herald Sun: ''Newsagents vow they won't sell it'' - January 03, 2008]</ref>

myki will need to be topped up as the stored value diminishes along the way.  This can be done in the same variety of ways as stated above.  One can also register myki and have it linked to a bank account to automatically top up when the stored value reaches a certain level.

As customers travel with myki they scan on at the beginning of their journey and scan off at the end at fare payment devices called myki scanners. myki can be scanned through a wallet or purse, but the wallet or purse needs to held against the scanner as scanning only works occasionally or not at all when the card is in a pocket, laptop bag or handbag. If myki is not scanned off at the completion of a journey a default fare is likely to be charged. Scanning off at the end of a journey is necessary for some rail journeys currently,{{Fact|date=July 2008}} but scanning off at the end of a tram or bus journey is new.

The Minister for Public Transport has instructed the TTA to focus the application of myki for transport fare payment before endeavouring on other retail concepts.<ref>{{cite news|last=Moynihan|first=Stephen|title=Transport cash card plan axed|publisher=The Age|date=2007-09-29|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/transport-cash-card-plan-axed/2007/09/28/1190486573013.html|
accessdate=2007-10-02}}</ref>

=== Card types ===
Many users can choose to register their myki or elect to have it remain anonymous. 

* '''Anonymous''': The Transport Ticketing Authority (TTA) will have no personal information.
* '''Registered''': The TTA will have some personal information. Lets you have a personalised card and protects the balance on the card if it is lost or stolen. How much personal information depends on how you top up your card and whether or not you have your name and/or photograph on the card.
* '''Concession''': The TTA requires some personal information to establish the concession entitlement, and because some concession entitlements require a personalised card with name and photograph.

There will also be the option of purchasing a temporary, disposable short term ticket which is valid for travel on the day of purchase only.

Criticisms have been raised about the necessity of photo IDs on concession cards as a potential invasion of privacy with some groups as non-concession cards do not require photo ID. Disability groups have questioned why the current system of separate photo ID that is presentable at the point of inspection cannot be retained. Requiring photo ID on concession cards will also hamper the ability of interstate concession holders to use the myki system.

=== Fare calculation ===
The myki system is designed to calculate the "Best Fare" for a commuter (i.e., if you travel more than once in a day, your 2-hourly fare will become a daily, being cheaper than 2 x 2-hourly fares). This automatic "Best Fare" system applies only up to weekly fares. Periodicals of up to 365 days can be pre-loaded using value-adding machines.  At present it appears that the 'Best Fare' calculation will only be available on the metropolitan system.

== Discovery centres ==
[[Image:MyKiDiscoveryCentre.jpg|thumb|200px|myki discovery centre at Southern Cross]]
A roaming ''discovery centre'', a specially designed semi-trailer is touring various locations throughout [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] for public and staff familiarisation.

A second stationary ''discovery centre'' is located at Southern Cross Station.  It was opened by Minister for Transport, ''[[Lynne Kosky]]'' on Thursday, [[8 March]] [[2007]].  The centre was then open to the general public from Friday, [[9 March]] [[2007]].<ref name=open>{{cite web

According to Minister Kosky's announcement, the site at [[Southern Cross Station]] includes "''... a series of interactive, visual, auditory and tactile activities including staff demonstrations, DVD displays and interactive learning experiences.''"<ref name=open />

The Southern Cross Station centre will initially be 7am-7pm, Monday to Friday, and 9am-5pm on weekends and public holidays.  As an educational facility, the discovery centre will be open for approximately 12 months, though its role may change during and after that time as the [[Transport Ticketing Authority]] begin to issue mykis.

The site costs $100,000 a year to rent from the station authority.<ref>{{cite web

== Benefits ==
The proposed system is intended to have the following benefits:
* It will calculate the "best fare" (i.e. the fare deemed most economical) in metropolitan areas.
* One card for both regional and metropolitan for broader usage.
* Future uses as a monetary value device and "epurse" to pay for non-travel expenses such as parking and vending machines.
* Has no moving parts to any part of the ticket system, to reduce maintenance costs of future installations.
* Reduction in fraud due to photograph based card implementation.

As the program has not yet been released, it is not yet confirmed whether these changes will actually have the effects on the system claimed by the ticketing authority.  It is expected that early in the system's release, surveys will be performed to confirm the success of the program's release.

== Criticism ==
The myki ticketing system has been criticised on a number of grounds:
* A total cost of around 1.35 billion dollars. $494 million for start up and $50-55 million per year to run the system along with other associated costs<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23156099-661,00.html Myki transport ticket system could now two years late | Herald Sun<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 
* Government is continuing to pay for the existing Metcard system.<ref>{{cite news |first=Clay |last=Lucas |title=Smart card delays fill ticket giant's coffers |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/smart-card-delays-fill-ticket-giants-coffers/2008/04/24/1208743153742.html |work=Age |date=April 25, 2008}}</ref>
* Fewer outlets as the retailer commissions currently proposed are lower than the existing Metcard.<ref name="hun-agent">[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23000129-661,00.html Herald Sun: ''Newsagents vow they won't sell it'' - January 03, 2008]</ref><ref>[http://www.posbrowser.com.au/b2evolution/blogs/index.php?blog=3&title=newsagents_vow_they_won_t_sell_it&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1#comments Newsagency software blog - Post details: Newsagents vow they won't sell it<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
* Controversies over the tendering process.  A staff member of the Transport Ticketing Authority left a memory stick in a room with representatives of one of the bidders.  The TTA claims that this was an accident and that there was no secret information on the memory stick.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20372975-2862,00.html Herald Sun: ''Notes get OK for tram fares'' - September 8th, 2006]</ref>  Also, the company hired by the TTA early in the process to give it technical advice is part of the winning consortium.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20370150-1243,00.html AAP 7th September, 2006], ''Taking the 'myki' with $500m smartcard''</ref> In late December 2007, it was revealed that investigators in the Auditor-General's office had uncovered serious probity concerns in the awarding of the contract to American IT firm Keane's Kamco consortium, although these concerns were not included in the Auditor's report to Parliament as they were said to be unsupported by the evidence.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22940497-661,00.html Herald Sun, 18 December 2007]</ref>

* Inconvenience: Having to scan on and scan off, when Melbourne already has difficulty getting all of its public transport users to validate once.  The government claims that with scanning being much easier, this should not be a problem.  The [[Public Transport Users Association]]'s Daniel Bowen has commented that current users of the Metcard technology are already not validating on each boarding, meaning the users of the myki system that do not tag-off may suffer maximum fare deduction as a penalty.

* Necessity: Critics, such as  the [[Public Transport Users Association|PTUA]], ask why a new ticketing system is needed, when Melbourne already has a relatively adequate one. Furthermore, current Metcard validating equipment has built-in support for a contact-less validating mechanism (the yellow circles on the front of current Metcard machines, as well as on TVM's).

*The state government's priorities have been attacked, with many asking why alleged fundamental failures in the transport system are not addressed (such as cleanliness and reliability) before creating an expensive new ticketing system.

* As one "long term card", should one lose their card, its monetary value is great and so the potential loss is also great (the implications are obviously greater for an anonymous user rather than a registered or concession user due to the difficulty of a person using a card with someone else's photograph). This is mitigated  by the options of buying short-term mykis and by being able to 'claim' credit back off a registered myki if it is lost. It is scrutinised though, as the myki ticket serves almost like a contact-less credit card, holding monetary value. The smartcard itself can function without being removed from a wallet even bags etc.

* Uncertainty: The final cost of a trip where the user has not scanned off (deliberately or due to accident) has not yet been released. However, the fare is not proposed to exceed the cost of a 2 hour, Zone 1+2 ticket ($4.74). The default fare may be increased by the conductor on V/line services where a customer is making a journey that exceeds the fare level. 

* Disability Access: Several elements of the myki program will be problematic for users with a disability (particularly those who are in wheelchairs, have cognitive problems or who lack fine hand control) due to the height of several pieces of equipment.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22122633-2862,00.html Herald Sun: ''Disabled miffed by ticket plan'' - July 24, 2007]</ref>.
