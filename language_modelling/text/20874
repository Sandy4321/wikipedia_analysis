'''Sadie Harris''' is a fictional character from the American television [[medical drama]] ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', which airs on the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) in the United States. The character was created by series producer [[Shonda Rhimes]] and portrayed by actress [[Melissa George]]. Introduced as a [[Internship (medicine)|surgical intern]] who has an old companionship with the series' protagonist [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), she eventually forms a friendship with [[Lexie Grey]] ([[Chyler Leigh]]), and departs after it is revealed she cheated her way into the surgical program.

George was invited to meet with ''Grey's Anatomy''{{'s}} executive producers after the show's casting agents saw her in the 2008 television drama, ''[[In Treatment]]''. The actress' original contract included eight to eleven episodes of recurring appearances in [[Grey's Anatomy (season 5)|season five]], with the possibility of becoming a series regular. She was originally planned to be a romantic foil for [[Erica Hahn]] ([[Brooke Smith (actress)|Brooke Smith]]) and [[Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]]), but the role was retooled after the former departed in November 2008.

After speculation as to whether the character would become a series regular, it was confirmed that George's character would not be joining the series and would soon depart. George explained that it was her own decision to leave the show, in response to the assertions that her departure was done to "de-gay" ''Grey's Anatomy''. The character has received mixed feedback from critics, and has been characterized as "naughty", "mischievous", and "nutty".<ref name="Hollywood Reporter">{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/greys-anatomy/melissa-george-talks-joining-greys-anatomy-cast_article_12201|title=Melissa George Talks Joining 'Grey's Anatomy' Cast|work=[[Access Hollywood]]|publisher=[[NBC Studios (New York)|NBC Studios]]|date=November 14, 2008|accessdate=November 30, 2008}}</ref>

==Storylines==
Sadie Harris first appears in the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 5)|season five]] episode "These Ties That Bind", in which it is made known that she was once a very close friend of [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]). Harris and Meredith Grey had given each other nicknames during an extended vacation in Europe: "Die" and "Death", respectively. Meredith Grey's best friend is [[Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]); Yang becomes jealous of the friendship between Meredith Grey and Harris. Having joined Seattle Grace Hospital as a [[Internship (medicine)|surgical intern]], Harris begins a friendship with fellow intern [[Lexie Grey]] ([[Chyler Leigh]]), Meredith Grey's sister.<ref name="TTTB">{{cite episode | title=These Ties That Bind | series=[[Grey's Anatomy]] | author=Writer: Stacy McKee.

When Harris comes out from a talk with Webber, she tells Meredith Grey that she has decided to quit, and that she did not qualify for the surgical program.
