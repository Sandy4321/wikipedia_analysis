The '''effects of Hurricane Isabel in Pennsylvania''' were primarily related to tropical storm force winds across much of the state. [[Hurricane Isabel]] formed from a [[tropical wave]] on September 6 2003 in the tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165&nbsp;mph (265&nbsp;km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] with winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] over western [[Pennsylvania]] the next day.

On September 19, Tropical Storm Isabel passed through southwestern Pennsylvania, though its large circulation produced tropical storm force winds throughout much of the state.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven & Hugh Cobb|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2006-12-26|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003isabel.shtml}}</ref> The passage of Hurricane Isabel resulted in $160&nbsp;million in damage (2003&nbsp;USD, $187&nbsp;million 2008&nbsp;USD) and two indirect deaths in Pennsylvania.<ref name="tcr"/> One person suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning, believed to be caused due to improperly ventilated generators in an area affected by the power outages.<ref name="mono">{{cite web|author=CNN|year=2003|title=Isabel death toll creeps higher|accessdate=2007-01-27|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WEATHER/09/22/isabel/index.html}}</ref> Moderate winds left about 1.4&nbsp;million customers without power across the state as a result of trees falling into power lines, with dozens of houses and cars damaged by the trees.

==Preparations==
While over the western Atlantic Ocean as a major hurricane, forecasters predicted Isabel would pass through the central portion of the state.<ref name="franklin39">{{cite web|author=Franklin/Pasch|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Discussion Thirty-Nine|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-01-27|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al132003.discus.039.shtml}}</ref> Successive forecasts shifted the track slightly further to the west, though its track into [[Ohio]] was not anticipated. Hours before it entered the state, the [[National Hurricane Center]] continued to predict Isabel would traverse the entire length of the state from south to north and later entering [[New York]] before crossing [[Lake Ontario]] into [[Canada]].<ref name="archive">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Tropical Discussions|accessdate=2007-01-27|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/ISABEL.shtml}}</ref> Around 3% of those who evacuated in North Carolina and in the [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]] stayed in Pennsylvania during the storm.<ref name="assess">{{cite web|author=Post, Buckley, Schuh and Jernigan|year=2005|title=Hurricane Isabel Assessment, a Review of Hurricane Evacuation Study Products and Other Aspects of the National Hurricane Mitigation and Preparedness Program (NHMPP) in the Context of the Hurricane Isabel Response|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2007-01-27|url=http://www.csc.noaa.gov/hes/docs/postStorm/Isabel_PostStorm_Summary.pdf}}</ref> The threat of the hurricane canceled some flights in and out of the state. To compensate, [[Delta Air Lines]] allowed those flying to or from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], and [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] to reschedule to a later date. [[American Airlines]] offered a similar option. [[United Airlines]] and [[United Express]] opted to waive charging fees for travelers in and out of the state.<ref name="cnn2">{{Cite web|author=Patty Davis and Beth Lewandowski|year=2003|title=Airlines allow passengers to rebook|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2007-01-27|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/09/17/airlines.hurricane/index.html}}</ref>

Prior to the arrival of Isabel, [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|Governor]] [[Ed Rendell]] declared a [[state of emergency]] for the state.<ref name="cnn">{{cite web|author=CNN|year=2003|title=Isabel knocks out power to more than 1 million|accessdate=2007-01-27|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WEATHER/09/18/hurricane.isabel/index.html}}</ref> The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency activated a support team to assist Urban Search and Rescue operations as part of the threat from the storm. The state's [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] placed 2,990&nbsp;guardsmen on Emergency Condition 5 status to be deployed anywhere in the state for emergency support, with other guardsmen readying equipment such as generators, heavy trucks, water trailers, and engineer equipment for deployment. State police officers were readied for deployment, while the state health department contacted hospitals to ensure generators were in working condition. The state Environmental Protection Agency prepared for the storm by monitoring the status of all dams, water treatment facilities, and nuclear plants. In addition, the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] Commission stationed extra workers to patrol the highways in poor drainage areas, with extra equipment prepared for quick response for potential road blockage.<ref name="pema">{{cite web|author=Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency|year=2003|title=Governor Rendell Directs State Officials to Prepare for Hurricane Isabel|accessdate=2007-01-28|url=http://www.pema.state.pa.us/pema/cwp/view.asp?a=7&q=255062}}</ref> Prior to the arrival of the storm, officials from [[Exelon|PECO energy]] prepared its largest workforce in its history with 1,500&nbsp;workers, including employees from [[Commonwealth Edison]] in [[Illinois]] and [[Detroit Edison]].<ref name="prsm">{{cite web|author=Transmission and Distribution World|year=2003|title=Eastern U.S. Utilities Prepare for Hurricane Isabel|accessdate=2007-01-29|url=http://tdworld.com/news/power_eastern_us_utilities/}}</ref>

Upon making landfall, Isabel produced a [[storm surge]] that tracked up the [[Delaware River]], with a station along the river in Philadelphia reporting a [[storm tide]] of 9.47&nbsp;feet (2.89&nbsp;m). There, the surge flooded low-lying areas along the river.<ref name="nwsmh">{{cite web|author=Gorse and Frugis|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Post Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=Mount Holly, New Jersey National Weather Service|accessdate=2007-01-27|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/phi/storms/09192003.txt}}</ref> The large circulation of the hurricane produced moderate winds throughout the state, with wind gusts in the southeastern portion of the state reaching 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h) in [[Forks Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Forks Township]].

Wind gusts reached 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h) in northeastern Pennsylvania, resulting in scattered reports of downed trees and power lines. Tens of thousands were left without power. A few downed trees hit cars and houses, with damage totaling about $350,000 (2003&nbsp;USD, $410,000 in 2008&nbsp;USD). The fallen trees also closed some roads.<ref name="nencdc">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2003|title=Event Report for Northeast Pennsylvania|accessdate=2007-01-30|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~519365}}</ref>

In the central portion of the state<!--here defined as the region under the State College National Weather Service-->, the storm dropped moderate precipitation of over 3&nbsp;inches (75&nbsp;mm), while wind gusts reached 73&nbsp;mph (117&nbsp;km/h) at a station in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]].

Downed wires set a [[Family Dollar]] on fire in [[Paradise Township, Pennsylvania|Paradise Township]] and was believed to have started a fire in a church in [[Ringtown, Pennsylvania|Ringtown]]. Falling trees hit at least eleven houses, with one tree severely damaging a mobile home in [[Bellwood, Pennsylvania|Bellwood]]. Damage directly from the wind was generally minor, and included a house losing a chimney in [[Camp Hill, Pennsylvania|Camp Hill]], a carport being blown over in [[New Oxford, Pennsylvania|New Oxford]], and at least four houses reporting roof or siding damage. The hurricane also damaged corn fields near [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]]. Downed trees closed or disrupted traffic on at least 56&nbsp;roads in the region, including [[U.S. Route 6|U.S. Routes 6]] and [[U.S. Route 322|322]], as well as [[Interstate 83]] in [[York County, Pennsylvania|York County]].<ref name="nwscen"/>
