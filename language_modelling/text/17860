'''Hurricane Carol''' was among the worst [[tropical cyclones]] on record to affect the [[New England]] region of the [[United States]]. It developed from a [[tropical wave]] near the [[Bahamas]] on August 25, 1954, and slowly strengthened as it moved northwestward. On August 27, Carol intensified to reach winds of 105&nbsp;mph (170&nbsp;km/h), but weakened as its motion became to a northwest drift. A strong [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] of low pressure turned the hurricane northeastward, and Carol later intensified into a [[tropical cyclone scales|major hurricane]].{{#tag:ref|A major hurricane is a tropical cyclone with [[maximum sustained winds]] of at least 111&nbsp;mph (179&nbsp;km/h), or a Category&nbsp;3 or higher on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir&ndash;Simpson hurricane scale]].<ref name="glo">{{cite web|author=[[National Hurricane Center]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|date=2010-07-11|title=Glossary of NHC Terms|accessdate=2011-07-23|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110628222802/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml|location=Miami, Florida|archivedate= 28 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>|group="nb"}} While paralleling the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[Southeastern United States]], the storm produced strong winds and rough seas that caused minor coastal flooding and slight damage to houses in [[North Carolina]], [[Virginia]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Delaware]], and [[New Jersey]]. The well-organized hurricane accelerated north-northeastward and made landfall on [[Long Island]], [[New York]] and [[Connecticut]] on August&nbsp;31 near peak intensity. Early on the following day, Carol transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] over [[New Hampshire]].

In New York, strong winds on Long Island damaged about 1,000 houses, left 275,000&nbsp;people without electricity, downed many trees, and resulted in heavy crop losses. Storm surge flooded [[LaGuardia Airport]] and inundated [[Montauk Highway]], which left the eastern portion of Long Island isolated. Carol also brought strong winds and rough seas to New England. Throughout the region, about 150,000&nbsp;people were left without electricity and telephone service. 1,545&nbsp;houses were destroyed and another 9,720&nbsp;were damaged. Approximately 3,500&nbsp;cars and 3,000&nbsp;boats were destroyed. There were 65&nbsp;deaths and 1,000&nbsp;injuries in New England. Overall, Carol caused 68&nbsp;fatalities and damage totaled about $460&nbsp;million (1954&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]),{{#tag:ref|All damage totals are in 1954 [[United States dollar]]s unless otherwise noted.|group="nb"}} making it the costliest hurricane in the history of the United States, at the time. Following the storm, Carol was [[List of retired Atlantic hurricane names|retired]], becoming the first name to be removed from the naming lists in the Atlantic basin.

A [[tropical wave]] spawned a tropical depression over the northeastern [[Bahamas]] on August&nbsp;25. It moved to the north-northwest and intensified into a tropical storm just six hours after forming. Receiving the name Carol, the storm gradually turned to the north, and strengthened under generally favorable conditions.<ref name="mwr"/> On August&nbsp;26, the [[Hurricane Hunters]] reported an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]], {{convert|23|mi|km}} in diameter despite Carol being a tropical storm.<ref name="reanal">{{cite report|page=71-72|title=Reanalysis of Ten U.S. Landfalling Hurricanes|author=Chris Landsea|author2=Mike Dickinson|author3=Donna Strahan|year=2006|accessdate=2013-03-21|publisher=Hurricane Research Division|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/10_US_hurricanes.pdf|format=PDF|location=Miami, Florida}}</ref> The next day, Carol strengthened to attain hurricane status while located about 345&nbsp;miles (545&nbsp;km) east of [[Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]].<ref name="mwr">{{cite journal|author=Walter R.

The high damage caused by Hurricane Carol and other hurricanes in 1954 prompted the United States government to devote research to set up the [[National Hurricane Research Project]]. Hurricane Hunters and the Weather Bureau collected data on subsequent hurricanes to determine their structure, as well as attempted to weaken storms with [[silver iodide]] via [[Project Stormfury]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Ray Bruner|date=1963-09-18|title=Hurricane Fighters Seek Achilles' Heel in Storm|newspaper=[[Toledo Blade]]|accessdate=2013-01-07|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RrFOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PQEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7206,1611569&dq=hurricane+carol+1954&hl=en|page=5|location=Toledo, Ohio}}</ref>

Due to the high damage, the name Carol was removed from the naming list for 10&nbsp;years. The name was reused in the [[1965 Atlantic hurricane season|1965 season]], but was retroactively retired, and it will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. Carol was the first Atlantic hurricane name in history to be retired.<ref>{{cite report|author=Gary Padgett, Jack Beven, James Lewis Free, Sandy Delgado|date=2012-05-23|title=Subject: B3) What storm names have been retired?|publisher=Hurricane Research Division|accessdate=2013-01-07|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/B3.html|location=Miami, Florida}}</ref>
