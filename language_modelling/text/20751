"'''Standing Up in the Milky Way'''" is the first aired episode of the American [[documentary film|documentary]] [[television series]] ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]''. It premiered on 9 March 2014 simultaneously on various [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television networks, including [[National Geographic Channel]], [[FX (TV network)|FX]], [[Fox Life]], and others.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2013/13-200.html | title=Library of Congress Officially Opens The Seth MacFarlane Collection of Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan Archive | publisher=[[Library of Congress]] | date=November 12, 2013 | accessdate=November 12, 2013 | author=Cannady, Sheryl | author2=Allen, Erin | issn=0731-3527}}</ref>  The episode is presented by the series host astrophysicist [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], directed by [[Brannon Braga]], produced by Livia Hanich and Steven Holtzman, and written by [[Ann Druyan]] and [[Steven Soter]].

The series represents a follow-up of the 1980s television series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'' by [[Carl Sagan]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/science/space/a-successor-to-sagan-reboots-cosmos.html | title=A Successor to Sagan Reboots ''Cosmos'' | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 3, 2014 | author=Overbye, Dennis | authorlink=Dennis Overbye | page=D2}}</ref> It is hosted by astrophysicist and author Neil deGrasse Tyson, and explores [[astronomy]], [[space and time]], [[astrophysics]], [[biology]], and other diverse areas of [[science]]. In this episode, Tyson takes a tour of the [[Solar System]] and the [[Milky Way]] galaxy, explores the life of [[Renaissance]] philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]] and his vision of the cosmos, goes through the [[Cosmic Calendar]] from the beginning of the universe until the present, and ends with a tribute to Carl Sagan. The episode also includes a brief introduction by the [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.engadget.com/2014/03/09/obama-cosmos-intro/ | title=''Cosmos'' debuts tonight with a special message from Barack Obama | publisher=[[AOL Inc.]] | work=[[Engadget]] | date=March 9, 2014 | accessdate=March 16, 2014 | author=Seppala, Timothy J.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/obama-launches-cosmos-next-great-discovery-could-be-yours-n48646 | title=Obama Launches ''Cosmos'': 'The Next Great Discovery Could Be Yours' | publisher=[[NBC News]] | date=March 13, 2014 | agency=[[Associated Press]] | accessdate=March 16, 2014 | author=Boyle, Alan}}</ref>

The episode received positive reviews by critics, but was criticized on issues like the historical accuracy in the presentation of [[Giordano Bruno]]'s life.

== Episode summary ==
[[File:Giordano Bruno.jpg|thumb|left|The astronomical theories of [[Giordano Bruno]] (1548 <U+2013> 1600) and their reception by the [[Catholic Church]] were featured in the episode's narrative sequence.]]
The episode begins with Tyson setting off on the "ship of imagination" to discover earth<U+2019>s cosmic address within the [[Virgo Supercluster]] and its place in [[space and time]]. He floats over the planets in the [[Solar System]]. Skimming over [[Venus]], he shows how [[greenhouse effect]] has turned the planet's temperature extremely hot. Then he explores [[Jupiter]]'s [[Great Red Spot]], a hurricane three times the size of Earth, and provides the first comparison by which it's seen how Earth's size is diminishing in the expanding view of the red spot.  He passes [[Voyager 1]], the furthest man-made object from Earth, and explains the [[Voyager Golden Record]] and its purpose.

Then Tyson explains how the [[human sight]] is limited in the cosmos, and shows that [[rogue planets]], which are extremely dark, can be seen with [[infrared sensor]]s. Then he examines the [[bubble theory]], and how our universe might be just a bubble in a never ending set of bubbles, comparing it with the drops of the [[waterfall]].

In an [[animated]] segment of the episode, Tyson discusses the life and vision of the Italian 16th-century philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]] as the person who championed a much more expansive understanding of the Earth's place in the universe, with the Sun being just one star among all the others. Later, he presents the [[history of the Universe]] on Carl Sagan's [[Cosmic Calendar]]. The episode ends with Tyson giving a speech on Carl Sagan's life and career, and how he inspired him to become an astrophysicist.

"Standing Up in the Milky Way" was critically well accepted. John Teti from ''[[The A.V.

Other reviews have criticized the historical accuracy of the segment on [[Giordano Bruno]] and question why the show did not portray more important astronomers of the time period, such as [[Copernicus]] or [[Galileo]], or earlier medieval natural philosophers, such as [[Nicole Oresme]] and [[Nicholas of Cusa]], who presented the possibility of a plurality of worlds centuries earlier than Bruno.<ref name="Powell">{{cite web | url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/outthere/2014/03/10/cosmos-pick-wrong-hero/ | title=Did ''Cosmos'' Pick the Wrong Hero? | publisher=[[Kalmbach Publishing]] | work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] | date=March 10, 2014 | accessdate=March 16, 2014 | author=Powell, Corey S.}}</ref><ref name="Campbell">{{cite web | url=http://www.science20.com/science_20/blog/cosmos_spacetime_odyssey_review-131240 | title=Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey <U+2013> The Review | publisher=Science 2.0 | date=March 7, 2014 | accessdate=March 16, 2014 | author=Campbell, Hank}}</ref>  Reviewers also complained that the segment was historically inaccurate in its portrayal of Bruno's troubles as stemming almost entirely from his belief in many worlds.<ref name="Powell"/><ref name="Campbell"/>

During the premier broadcast of the episode on March 9, 2014, on FOX 25 [[KOKH-TV]], the episode was interrupted for 15 seconds. The brief interruption of the episode by an advertisement for ''FOX 25 Primetime News at Nine'' coincided with a monologue by Tyson in which he describes human evolution.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/13/oklahoma-station-cut-cosmos-evolution-video_n_4958024.html | title=Oklahoma TV Station Cuts Reference To Evolution In Neil deGrasse Tyson's ''Cosmos'' | publisher=[[AOL Inc.]] | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=March 13, 2014 | accessdate=March 16, 2014 | author=Grenoble, Ryan}}</ref> FOX 25 issued a statement of apology for the event, which also rejected accusations that the incident was intentional, but "the result of operator error."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/OKCFOX/statuses/443876438744506368 | title=Sunday, during @COSMOSonTV [...] | publisher=[[Twitter]] | date=March 12, 2014 | accessdate=March 16, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/OKCFOX/status/444222284828770304 | title=We'll admit it: Sunday, we [...] | publisher=[[Twitter]] | date=March 13, 2014 | accessdate=March 16, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.okcfox.com/story/24969923/fox-25-apologizes-for-error-during-cosmos | title=FOX 25 apologizes for error during ''Cosmos'' | publisher=[[WorldNow]] | work=[[KOKH-TV]] | date=March 13, 2014 | accessdate=March 16, 2014}}</ref>
