'''''Bloom County''''' was a popular American [[comic strip]] by [[Berke Breathed]] which ran from [[December 8]], [[1980]] until [[August 6]], [[1989]].  It examined events in politics and culture through the lens of a fanciful small town in [[Middle America (US)|Middle America]], where children have adult personalities (and vocabularies) and animals can talk. It grew out of a strip called ''[[The Academia Waltz]]'', which Breathed produced for the student newspaper while attending the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]].

==Characters==
===Core characters===

*'''[[Opus the penguin|Opus]]''' is a large-nosed penguin with a [[herring]] addiction who lost track of his mother during the [[Falklands War]].  Initially, Opus was only a bit player in one of the strip's [[throwaway gags]].  But his hopeless na<U+00EF>vet<U+00E9> made him a favorite, the center of the strip, and the subject of two "sequel" strips (''[[Outland (comic)|Outland]]'' and ''[[Opus (comic strip)|Opus]]''), two children's books, and [[A Wish for Wings That Work|a television special]].[[image:Milo_reporter.jpg|thumbnail|180px|right|Milo Bloom]]
*'''[[Milo Bloom]]''' is a ten-year-old newspaper reporter and probably the most worldly-wise of the bunch.  Milo was the original protagonist of ''Bloom County''.
*'''[[Steve Dallas]]''' is a former fraternity member, unsuccessful practicing lawyer, would-be womanizer, manager of the band, [[Billy and the Boingers]] ([[Deatht<U+00F6>ngue]]), legend in his own mind, and antagonist of the group.  He is usually seen with a cigarette in his mouth.
*'''[[Bill the Cat]]''' is a large orange tabby.  Originally introduced as a parody of the comic character, [[Garfield]], and saying little beyond his trademark responses, "Ack" and "Pbthhh", he has become something of a blank slate around which various plots have revolved. He's been a cult leader ("Bhagwan Bill"), televangelist ("Fundamentally Oral Bill"), perennial [[Presidential]] candidate (for the [[National Radical Meadow Party]]), heavy-metal rock star ("Wild Bill Catt"), and, in the last months of "Bloom County", had his brain surgically replaced with [[Donald Trump]]'s.  But he has been known to speak on occasion, most notably during the Communist witch-hunt trials he conducted, when he remarked, "Say, you don't suppose the "Jury Box" is anything like a litter box, do you?"
*'''[[Michael Binkley]]''' originally owned Opus ("A boy and his penguin!") and is wishy-washy and overly reflective (perhaps like Charlie Brown?), when not contemplating the lives of pop-culture icons.  His "anxiety closet" has been a staple of many storylines.
*'''[[Oliver Wendell Jones]]''' is a young African-American [[computer hacker]] and gifted scientist, having invented a miracle hair-growth formula, among other things. He once tried to bring an end to the [[Cold War]] by introducing onto the front page of ''[[Pravda]]'' the headline, "[[Gorbachev]] Urges [[Disarmament]]: Total! [[Unilateral]]!", but faulty translation caused the headline to read, "[[Gorbachev]] Sings Tractors: Turnip! Buttocks!" He has a fairly extensive [[crime|criminal]] record as a result of his numerous computer pranks.
*'''[[Cutter John]]''' is a wheelchair-bound [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] veteran, noted for ''[[Star Trek]]'' fantasies and anti-war protests.  He was not a womanizer like Steve Dallas, but he was more popular with the ladies.  
*'''[[Bobbi Harlow]]''' is the [[feminism|feminist]] schoolteacher of Milo and Binkley and the love interest of both Steve and Cutter. She was only a major character until [[1983]], when she disappeared, to appear only once in the strip's later years, when Opus learns she has joined the crew of ''[[The Phil Donahue Show]]''.
*'''[[Hodge-Podge]]''' is a rabbit who is best friends with Portnoy and Cutter John.  He is politically conservative and fanatical about various issues, despite the fact that he is extremely ignorant about those same issues.  Hodge-Podge usually sides with Portnoy, but has been shown to differ with him as well.  For example, he joined Steve Dallas's heavy metal band even though Portnoy said it was dumb. Also, he once stopped speaking with Portnoy when Portnoy revealed that he was a groundhog.  They later made up.  
*'''[[Portnoy (Bloom County character)|Portnoy]]''' is a groundhog, although his species was a mystery for most of Bloom County's run. Before the revelation that he was a groundhog, he was portrayed as a squirrel, woodchuck, gopher, and possum.  Portnoy was the grouchiest and most bigoted character by far.

===Other characters===
*[[Lola Granola]]
*[[Milquetoast the Cockroach]]
*[[Rosebud the Basselope]]
*[[Ronald-Ann Smith]]

==Notable storylines==
''For detailed summaries of all storylines, see the entries for the individual books.''
[[Image:Steve_Dallas.jpg|framed|right|[[Steve Dallas]] learns that [[Bill the Cat]] has sold-out their heavy metal group, [[Billy and the Boingers]].]]
* Steve forms a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band with Opus, Hodge Podge, and Bill, initially called "Deatht<U+00F6>ngue". Steve is forced to rename the band [[Billy and the Boingers]] after he is dragged before a [[United States Congress|congressional]] hearing investigating the effect of heavy metal music on youth, similar to the [[Parents Music Resource Center]]. The Boingers disband after their frontman, Bill the Cat, is caught attending a [[Devotion|Bible study]] group with a woman whose character is based on [[Mother Teresa]]. Ironically, the group suffers but the woman ends up with a [[Pepsi]] endorsement.
* Oliver Jones finds out about [[Apartheid]] and builds a "photo-pigmentizer" with which he plans to start an international brouhaha by using it on the South African ambassador to the US, making him black. Oliver sends the machine to Washington D.C. with Cutter John on a balloon chair (this aspect of the story may have been based on the flight of so-called "lawn chair pilot" [[Larry Walters]]), and Opus is accidentally dragged along. While airborne, several balloons are popped by shotguns, sending the two plummeting into the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Both are assumed dead, so Opus' money is given to Bill the Cat, who wastes it all. Eventually, Opus turns up at the Bloom County Boarding House with [[amnesia]], which lasts until he is shocked by an erroneous news report that [[Diane Sawyer]] has married [[Eddie Murphy]], after which he reveals that he and Cutter John survived the splash-down and were captured by [[Russia]]ns. The Russians kicked Opus off the submarine and took Cutter John back to Russia. The citizens later swap Bill the Cat for Cutter John.
* Opus decides to reunite with his long-lost mother for Christmas in Antarctica, only to discover that the ship he's travelling on is the ''[[Rainbow Warrior]]''. Escaping Russian whalers with his next-door neighbour, Mrs. Limekiller, he enters the world's least despoiled civilization only to be attacked by American troops invading. Opus later discovers that his Mother supposedly died saving soldiers in the Falklands war.  Her gravestone reads, 'The Falklands Martyr: She Loved her Boy'.
* Opus discovers that his mother is alive.  (He screams to Milo, "SHE ISN'T DEAD!", to which Milo replies "Who? The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]?"). He tries to rescue her from captivity in the [[Mary Kay]] cosmetics testing centre.  He discovers his Mum in a cage (she vaguely resembles Opus wearing Mary Poppins's hat) only to be caught in a firefight between Mary Kay ladies with Pink Uzis and the Animal Liberation Guerilla Front.  
* In a spoof of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]]'s [[fatwa]] on [[Salman Rushdie]], Opus is the subject of a fatwa by the Mary Kay cosmetics company for writing an editorial suggesting that women wearing too much makeup look "ungodly."
* [[Donald Trump]]'s body is damaged by his own anchor, but his brain is successfully transplanted into the body of Bill the Cat. Trump/Bill sees the brighter side of the situtation: "Legally, now I can poop on [[Ed Koch]]'s lawn."
* Opus receives 779 million dollars in cash from the U.S. Government under the mistaken belief that he is a scientist working on [[missile defense]] research. Opus uses the money to buy [[Bolivia]], neglecting to keep the receipt. When another boxful of money turns up asking for a Space Weapon, he and Oliver create a plan entitled 'Net Wars'; a suggestion that 200 Billion Dollars should be sewn together and made into a ring around the earth, Similar to those of [[Saturn]]. The government buys it.
* After the breakup of Billy and the Boingers, Bill the Cat becomes a [[Christian fundamentalism|Fundamentalist]] [[televangelist]], "Fundamentally Oral Bill" (a play on [[Oral Roberts]]). He declares "penguin lust" to be the biggest scourge on society. As a result, Opus is banished from Bloom County and briefly becomes a male stripper (who refuses to remove all his clothes).
* The cast of Bloom County goes on [[labor strike|strike]].  W. A. Thornhump refuses to concede to any of their demands and attempts to have his office staff fill in.  Things get ugly when [[Steve Dallas]] crosses the picket line and Thornhump hires [[scab|strike-breaker]]s to play Opus, Bill, and Oliver.  In the end, the strikers are defeated although Opus still threw eggs at Steve saying "Here comes breakfast from Aunt Opus!!"

==Other Notes==

For reasons unknown, Breathed's hand-printed signature on his strips is usually presented in mirror image, i.e. right to left.

Among the topical issues discussed at length in Bloom County are US [[War on Drugs|anti-drug policy]] (Dr. Oliver's Scalp Tonic), [[Christian televangelist scandals]] (Fundamentally Oral Bill), [[animal testing]] (Attack of the Mary Kay Commandos), hard rock and censorship (Deatht<U+00F6>ngue and [[Billy and the Boingers]]), and mass-media advertising (Opus and his weakness for [[infomercial]]s).

Berke Breathed was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in [[editorial cartooning]] in 1987 for ''Bloom County''.

Breathed decided to end the strip in 1989. In the continuity of the strip, a series of events (initiated by Bill the Cat's body becoming a vessel for Donald Trump's brain) led to the dismissal of the original characters and a plot transition to Breathed's next strip.

Shortly after ''Bloom County'' ended, Breathed started a Sunday-only strip called ''[[Outland (comic)|Outland]]'' with original characters and situations introduced in ''Bloom County'''s final days. However, Opus, Bill, and other characters eventually reappeared and slowly took over the strip. ''Outland'' ran from [[September 3]], [[1989]] to [[March 26]], [[1995]].  Another Sunday-only spinoff strip called ''[[Opus (comic strip)|Opus]]'' started on [[November 23]], [[2003]].

==Impact==
Bloom County has had a influence on other cartoonists, particularly cartoonists who have a particularly irreverent bent or tackle political topics in their work:
* Scott Kurtz, creator of the popular webcomic [[PvP]], acknowledged Breathed's contributions at one point with a strip expressing the opinion that "so many webcomics...are nothing but Bloom County ripoffs", then lampooning itself by [[mimic]]king Breathed's art and dialogue style itself in the final panel [http://www.pvponline.com/archive.php3?archive=19991001].
* [[Aaron McGruder]], creator of the comic and later animated series ''[[The Boondocks]]'', has paid homage to Breathed's work as well, with a few aspects of the strip bearing more than a passing resemblance to important Bloom County features, and an episode of the animated series wherein the character Uncle Ruckus calls Breathed "Master Penguin Draw'er".
*In the film [http://www.secondhandlions.com Secondhand Lions]the adult Walter is a cartoonist. Look closely and you'll see a resemblance between his comic strip and Bloom County. Berke Breathed is credited in the film as the artist.

==Bloom County itself==

The fictional setting of Bloom County served as a recurring backdrop for the comic and its sequels, although the nature of the setting was frequently altered.

[[Image:Bloom County May 1989.jpg|thumb|325px|right|'''Opus's last birthday in ''Bloom County'''''<br>
From left to right, Reynelda the doll, Ronald-Ann Smith, Binkley, Milo, Hodge-Podge, Portnoy, and Opus.]]In the comics, the county is presented as a stereotypical [[Midwestern United States|American midwestern]] small town. The small town setting was frequently contrasted with the increasing [[globalization]] taking place in the rest of the world; though Bloom County contained the likes of farmers and wilderness creatures by default, it was frequented by [[Hare Krishna]]s, [[feminist]]s, and [[rock and roll|rock]] stars.

While the location of Bloom County is never explicitly mentioned, there have been some clues in the strip. When Oliver Jones identified Bloom County as the place where [[Comet Halley|Halley's Comet]] would crash into Earth, a sign was seen saying that it was at 35.05 N  146.55 E. This would place it in the [[Pacific Ocean]], about 300 miles off the coast of [[Japan]]. Oliver's previous calculation was 39.43 N  105.01 W, which would place it just south of [[Denver, Colorado]]. Another strip has Opus stating that [[Des Moines, Iowa]] was 94 miles away from Bloom County, which would place it in either [[Iowa]] or [[Missouri]], but likely referring to the distance from Iowa City, where the strip was produced, to Des Moines.

The county was home to the Bloom Boarding House, Steve Dallas' law offices, the ''Bloom Beacon'' and ''Bloom Picayune'' newspapers, at least one pond, and Milo's Meadow. In the comic's later years, the county contained what appeared to be a big-city [[ghetto]] ("across the tracks", as it was known).

The geographical profile of the county was fluid as the artistic style of the strip evolved. During most of ''Bloom County'''s run, the rural meadow setting was presented realistically, while in its later years it became increasingly more abstract.

Bloom County's role in ''[[Outland (comic)|Outland]]'' was a bit questionable, as the "Outland" setting of the strip was originally set apart from the county by way of a magical doorway. By ''Outland''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> end, however, the Outland appeared to be a part of Bloom County itself.

''[[Opus (comic strip)|Opus]]'' currently takes place in Bloom County.

===Real world references===
''Bloom County'' contained many similarities to [[Iowa City, Iowa]], where Breathed lived at the time. The Bloom Boarding House, for example, which appeared as a high contrast photo within the strip, was an actual residence located at 935 East College Street in Iowa City. Breathed lived in the home during part of the time he was publishing Bloom County. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

In addition, Breathed used the [[call letters]] KRNA to refer to Bloom County's rock radio station featuring [[Minor characters in Bloom County#.22Rockin.27 Charmin.27 Harmin.22|"Rockin' Charmin' Harmon"]]. The call letters belonged to an actual rock station based in Iowa City in the 1980s, which featured a disc jockey named "Charmin'" Jeff Harmon. The station still operates in Iowa to this day. [http://www.krna.com]

Several Iowa City local news items also directly inspired ''Bloom County'' storylines.  For example, a Bloom County politician's sexist gaffe, referring to a woman as a "lil' dumplin'", was taken directly from an incident when University of Iowa football coach Hayden Fry made the same comment, infuriating feminists at the university.

Further, the final ''Bloom County'' strip hangs in the Iowa City Public Library.

==''Bloom County'' books==
