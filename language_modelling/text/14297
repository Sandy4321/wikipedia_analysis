'''Jamal ad-Din''' (flourished mid [[14th century]]) was governor of [[Ifat]]. He was the son of Nahwi b. Mansur b. [[Umar ibn Dunya-huz|Umar Walashma]] and a brother of [[Haqq ad-Din I]].

The [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] [[Amda Seyon I]] made him governor of Ifat after the defeat and imprisonment of his brother [[Sabr ad-Din I]]. Taddesse Tamrat notes that Jamal ad-Din had been released from prison upon his appointment, and speculates that the Emperor had held onto the noble as a hostage to guarrantee the loyalty of Ifat.<ref>Taddesse Tamrat, ''Church and State in Ethiopia'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972), p. 144.</ref>

However, according to the ''Glorious Victories of Amda Seyon'', Jamal ad-Din proved unfaithful to Emperor Amda Seyon. First, he allegedly was part of the alliance that attacked, and was defeated by, the Emperor in the [[Battle of Das]];<ref>J. Spencer Trimingham, ''Islam in Ethiopia'' (Oxford: Geoffrey Cumberlege for the University Press, 1952), pp. 71f.</ref> towards the end of that same year, Jamal ad-Din was ordered to deliver apostate [[Christian]]s to the Emperor for punishment, but refused, although he did produce the "son of his brother". For this, Emperor Amda Seyon ravaged Ifat and replaced Jamal ad-Din with his brother [[Nasr ad-Din]].<ref>G.W.B. Huntingford (translator), ''Glorious Victories of Amda Seyon'' (Oxford: University Press, 1956), p. 80.</ref> The interpretation of this passage varies: Trimingham holds he joined the alliance of [[Mora, Ethiopia|Mora]] and [[Adal Sultanate|Adal]] in revolt against the empire, but they were defeated by the Emperor;<ref>Huntingford, pp. 106f.</ref> on the other hand, Taddesse Tamrat states that Jamal's disloyalty never got that far, and he was recalled to the Ethiopian court and returned to prison on the pretext that he failed to find and bring to the Emperor all of the Christians who had converted to [[Islam]]; Jamal ad-Din alleged that the "son of his brother" (whom Taddesse Tamrat speculates might be the son of [[Sa'ad ad-Din]]) had prevented him from doing so.<ref>Taddesse Tamrat, p. 145.</ref>
