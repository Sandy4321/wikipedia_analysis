The '''Posavina Canton'''([[Croatian language|croatian]] <U+017E>upanija)  is a [[cantons of Bosnia and Herzegovina|canton]] of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].  It is the smallest canton, with an area of only 325 km<U+00B2> (just 50% larger than the nearby [[Br<U+010D>ko|Br<U+010D>ko District]]) populated by 43,588 people (2003), 83% of them are [[Croats]]. Its capital city is [[Ora<U+0161>je]] (a town of ca. 3,400 residents).

==Municipalities==

The canton is split into the municipalities of [[Domaljevac]], [[Od<U+017E>ak]], [[Ora<U+0161>je]].

==Population==

In 2003, population of Posavina Canton numbered 43,558 people, including:
*Croats: 36,049 (82.8%)
*Bosniaks: 6,360 (14.6%)
*Serbs: 728 (1.8%)
*others: 367 (0.8%)

==Geography==

The canton lies near the border with Croatia and near the river [[Sava]] which forms a natural border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

[[Posavina]] is a region which include other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of Croatia. Because of that, this canton is sometimes called Bosanska Posavina (Bosnian Posavina) and is the only part of northern Bosnia near the border with Croatia that lies in the Federation. The rest of northern Bosnia near the river Sava and near the border is the [[Br<U+010D>ko District]] and the [[Republika Srpska]]. The Br<U+010D>ko district cuts Republika Srpska in 2 parts.

The Posavina canton's position near the Sava river makes it a good place for agriculture because it is a flat lowland and there are no mountains in the area. It is like this in the entire northern border with Croatia, with a great deal of farming and agriculture. The river Sava is a river who flows through Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. In Bosnia and Herzegovina it flows through the northern border and makes a natural border between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.

Posavina means literally along Sava in the local languages. The river Sava is the largest navigable river in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Much of the food in both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia comes from this region, not only Bosnian Posavina but the rest of the fertile fields along the river Sava.

==Sport==

[[HNK Ora<U+0161>je]], the local football club from [[Ora<U+0161>je]] won the [[Football Cup of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].
