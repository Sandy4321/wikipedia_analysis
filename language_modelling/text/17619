'''South America''' is the southern [[continent]] of the [[Americas]],<ref>"[http://www.bartleby.com/65/st/SthAmer.html South America]. ''[http://www.bartleby.com/65/ The Columbia Encyclopedia]'', 6th ed. 2001-6. New York, [[Columbia University Press]]": "fourth largest continent ..., the southern of the two continents of the Western Hemisphere."</ref> situated entirely in the [[Western Hemisphere]] and mostly in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], with a relatively small portion in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. It is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and on the north and east by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]] lie to the northwest.

South America was named in 1580 by cartographers [[Martin Waldseem<U+00FC>ller]] and [[Matthias Ringmann]] after [[Amerigo Vespucci]], who was the first European to suggest that the Americas were not the [[East Indies]], but a [[New World]] unknown to Europeans.

South America has an [[area]] of 17,840,000 [[square kilometer]]s (6,890,000 sq mi), or almost 3.5% of the [[Earth]]'s surface. As of 2005, its [[population]] was estimated at more than 371,090,000. South America [[Continent#Area and population|ranks fourth]] in area (after [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[North America]]) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, [[Europe]], and North America).

==History==
{{main|History of South America}}

===Agriculture and animal domestication===
[[File:SantaCruz-CuevaManos-P2210651b.jpg|thumb|The prehistoric [[Cueva de las Manos]], or ''Cave of Hands'', in Argentina]]

South America is thought to have been first inhabited by people crossing the [[Bering Land Bridge]], which is now the [[Bering Strait]]. Some archaeological finds do not fit this theory and have led to an alternative theory of [[Pre-Siberian American Aborigines]]. The first evidence for the existence of agricultural practices in South America dates back to circa 6500 BC, when [[potatoes]], [[chillies]] and [[beans]] began to be cultivated for food in the highlands of the [[Amazon Basin]]. Pottery evidence further suggests that [[manioc]], which remains a staple food today, was being cultivated as early as 2000 BC.<ref name="OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas">O'Brien, Patrick. (General Editor). Oxford Atlas of World History. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. pp. 25</ref>

By 2000 BC many agrarian village communities had been settled throughout the Andes and the surrounding religious regions. Fishing became a widespread practice along the coast which helped to establish fish as a primary source of food. Irrigation systems were also developed at this time, which aided in the rise of an agrarian society.<ref name="OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas"/>

South American cultures began domesticating [[llamas]], [[vicu<U+00F1>as]], [[guanacos]], and [[alpacas]] in the highlands of the Andes circa 3500 BC. Besides their use as sources of meat and wool, these animals were used for transportation of goods.<ref name="OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas"/>

===Pre-Columbian civilizations===
[[File:Sunset across Machu Picchu.jpg|thumb|The Inca ruins of [[Machu Picchu]].]]

The rise of agriculture and the subsequent appearance of permanent human settlements allowed for the multiple and overlapping beginnings of civilizations in South America.

The earliest known settlements, and culture in South America and the Americas altogether, are the [[Valdivia Culture|Valdivia]] on the Southeast coast of Ecuador.

The earliest known South American civilization was at [[Norte Chico]], on the central [[Peru]]vian coast. Though a pre-ceramic culture, the monumental architecture of Norte Chico is contemporaneous with the pyramids of [[Ancient Egypt]]. The [[Chavin culture|Chav<U+00ED>n]] established a trade network and developed agriculture by 900 BC, according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called [[Chav<U+00ED>n de Huantar]] in modern Peru at an elevation of 3,177 meters. Chav<U+00ED>n civilization spanned 900 BC to 300 BC.

The [[Muisca]] were the main indigenous civilization in what is now modern Colombia. They established a confederation of many clans, or cacicazgos, that had a free trade network among themselves. They were goldsmiths and farmers.

Other important Pre-Columbian cultures include: [[Moche]] (100 BC <U+2013> 700 AD, at the northern coast of Peru); Tiuahuanaco or Tiwanaku (100 BC <U+2013> 1200 AD, Bolivia); the [[Ca<U+00F1>aris]] (in south central Ecuador), [[Paracas culture|Paracas]] and [[Nazca culture|Nazca]] (400 BC <U+2013> 800 AD, Peru); Wari or [[Huari]] Empire (600 <U+2013> 1200, Central and northern Peru); [[Chimu]] Empire (1300 <U+2013> 1470, Peruvian northern coast); [[Chachapoyas]]; and the Aymaran kingdoms (1000 <U+2013> 1450, Bolivia and southern Peru).

Holding their capital at the great [[cougar]]-shaped city of [[Cusco]], the [[Inca civilization]] dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533. Known as ''Tawantin suyu'', or "the land of the four regions," in [[Quechua]], the Inca civilization was highly distinct and developed. Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities, some 9 to 14 million people connected by a 25,000 kilometer [[Inca road system|road system]]. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was a useful form of agriculture.

===European colonization===
[[File:Mestizo.jpg|thumb|A representation of a '''Mestizo''', in a "Pintura de [[Castas]]" in the Colonial era. "From Spaniard and Amerindian woman, begets Mestizo".]]

In 1494, [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], the two great maritime powers of that time, on the expectation of new lands being discovered in the west, signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], by which they agreed that all the land outside Europe should be an exclusive [[duopoly]] between the two countries.

The Treaty established an imaginary line along a north-south [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] 370 [[league]]s west of [[Cape Verde Islands]], roughly 46<U+00B0> 37' W. In terms of the treaty, all land to the west of the line (known to comprehend most of the South American soil) would belong to Spain, and all land to the east, to Portugal. As accurate measurements of [[longitude]] were impossible at that time, the line was not strictly enforced, resulting in a [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese expansion of Brazil]] across the meridian.

Beginning in the 1530s, the people and natural resources of South America were repeatedly exploited by foreign [[conquistadors]], first from Spain and later from Portugal. These competing colonial nations claimed the land and resources as their own and divided it into colonies.

European infectious diseases ([[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[measles]], and [[typhus]])<U+2014>to which the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native populations]] had no immune resistance<U+2014>and systems of forced labor, such as the [[hacienda]]s and mining industry's [[Mita (Inca)|mita]], decimated the native population under Spanish control.

African [[Slavery|slaves]] were brought in large quantities for several centuries for a number of reasons, both political and economical; however, it was mainly because they were much better fitted than the American natives for hard labor in tropical climate such as [[sugar cane]] plantations or gold mining.

The Spaniards were committed to convert their native subjects to [[Christianity]] and were quick to purge any native cultural practices that hindered this end; however, most initial attempts at this were only partially successful, as native groups simply blended [[Catholicism]] with traditional idolatry and their [[polytheism|polytheistic]] beliefs. Furthermore, the Spaniards did impose their language to the degree they did their religion, although the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s evangelization in [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], and [[Guaran<U+00ED> language|Guaran<U+00ED>]] actually contributed to the continuous use of these native languages albeit only in the oral form.

Eventually, the [[native Americans (Americas)|natives]] and the Spaniards interbred, forming a [[mestizo]] class. Essentially all of the mestizos of the Andean region were offspring of Amerindian mothers and Spanish fathers. Mestizos and the Indian natives were often forced to pay extraordinary taxes to the Spanish crown and were punished more harshly for disobeying the law.

Many native artworks were considered pagan idols and destroyed by Spanish explorers; this included many gold and silver sculptures and other artifacts found in South America, which were melted down before their transport to Spain or Portugal.

[[Guyana]] was a Portuguese, Dutch, and eventually a British colony. The country was once partitioned into three, each being controlled by one of the colonial powers until the country was finally taken over fully by the British.

===Independence===
{{Main|Hispanic American wars of independence}}
[[File:Entrevista de Guayaquil.jpg|thumb|[[Guayaquil conference]], between [[Jos<U+00E9> de San Mart<U+00ED>n]] and [[Sim<U+00F3>n Bol<U+00ED>var]].]]

The South American possessions of the Spanish Crown won their independence between 1704 and 1776 in the [[South American Wars of Independence]]. [[Sim<U+00F3>n Bol<U+00ED>var]] of Venezuela and [[Jos<U+00E9> de San Mart<U+00ED>n]] of Argentina were the most important leaders of the independence struggles. Bol<U+00ED>var led a great uprising in northern South America, then led his army southward towards [[Lima]], the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]].
Meanwhile, San Mart<U+00ED>n led an army from the [[Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata]] across the Andes Mountains, meeting up with General [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] in Chile, and then marched northward to gain the military support of various rebels from the Viceroyalty of Peru. The two armies finally met in Guayaquil, [[Ecuador]], where they cornered the Royal Army of the Spanish Crown and forced its surrender.

In the Portuguese colony of Brazil, [[Dom Pedro I]] (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portguese King [[Dom Jo<U+00E3>o VI]], proclaimed the country's independence in 1822 and became Brazil's first [[Emperor]]. This was peacefully accepted by the crown in Portugal.

Although Bolivar attempted to unify politically the Spanish-speaking parts of the continent into the "[[Gran Colombia]]", they rapidly became independent states without political connections between them, despite some later attempts such as the [[Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation]].

A few countries did not gain independence until the 20th century:
* Guyana, from the [[United Kingdom]], in 1966
* [[Suriname]], from [[Netherlands|Dutch]] control, in 1975

[[French Guiana]] remains part of [[France]].

The [[Falkland Islands]] and the [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] archipelagos are [[United Kingdom|British]] territories.

===Recent history===
[[File:Pinochet y Videla.jpg|thumb|[[Jorge Videla]] (left) and [[Augusto Pinochet]] in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], Argentina in 1978]]

The continent became a battlefield of the [[Cold War]] in the late 20th century. Some governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay were overthrown or displaced by [[United States]]-aligned military dictatorships in the 1960s and 1970s. To curtail opposition, their governments detained tens of thousands of [[political prisoner]]s, many of whom were tortured and/or killed on [[Operation Condor|inter-state collaboration]]. Economically, they began a transition to [[neoliberal]] economic policies. They placed their own actions within the U.S. Cold War doctrine of "National Security" against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Peru suffered from [[Internal conflict in Peru|an internal conflict]].

Colombia currently faces an internal conflict, which started in 1964 with the creation of [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] (FARC-EP) and now involves several illegal armed groups of leftist leaning ideology as well as the private armies of powerful drug lords.

Revolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships became common after [[World War II]], but since the 1980s a wave of democratization came through the continent, and democratic rule is widespread now.<ref>"The Cambridge History of Latin America", edited by Leslie Bethell, Cambridge University Press (1995) ISBN 0-521-39525-9</ref>
Nonetheless, allegations of corruption are still very common, and several countries have developed crises which have forced the resignation of their governments, although, in most occasions, regular civilian succession has continued this far.

[[Developing countries' debt|International indebtedness]] turned into a severe problem in late 1980s, and some countries, despite having strong democracies, have not yet developed political institutions capable of handling such crises without recurring to unorthodox economical policies, as most recently illustrated by [[Argentina]]'s [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|default]] in the early 21st century.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=6tNWbywFXhkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=latin+american+history</ref>

==Politics==
[[File:SACN member states.jpg|thumb|[[United Nations geoscheme|Scheme for geographic regions and subregions]] used by the [[United Nations Statistics Division]].]]

During the first decade of the 21st century, South American governments have drifted to the political left, with [[Socialism|socialist]] leaders being elected in Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay and Venezuela. Despite the move to the left, South America for the most part still embraces [[free market]] policies, and it is taking an active path toward greater continental integration.

Recently, an intergovernmental entity has been formed which aims to merge the two existing customs unions: [[Mercosur]] and the [[Andean Community]], thus forming the third-largest trade bloc in the world.<ref>[http://www.globalpolicy.org/nations/sovereign/integrate/2008/1029newconsensus.htm Globalpolicy.org]</ref>
This new political organization known as [[Union of South American Nations]] seeks to establish free movement of people, economic development, a common defense policy and the elimination of [[tariff]]s.

[[File:South America satellite orthographic.jpg|thumb|A composite relief image of South America.]]
[[File:La Cordill<U+00E8>re des Andes.jpg|thumb|The [[Andes]].]]

South America occupies the minor southern portion of the [[landmass]] generally referred to as the [[New World]]. The continent is generally delimited on the northwest by the [[Dari<U+00E9>n Gap|Dari<U+00E9>n watershed]] along the [[Colombia]]-[[Panama]] border, or (according to some sources) by the [[Panama Canal]] which transects the [[Isthmus of Panama]].

Many of the islands of the [[Caribbean|Caribbean (or West Indies)]] <U+2013> e.g., the Leeward and [[Lesser Antilles]] <U+2013> sit atop the [[Caribbean Plate]], a tectonic plate with a diffuse topography. The islands of [[Aruba]], [[Barbados]], [[Trinidad]], and [[Tobago]] sit on the northerly South American [[continental shelf]]. The [[Netherlands Antilles]] and the [[federal dependencies of Venezuela]] lie along the northerly South American shelf. Geopolitically, the island states and overseas territories of the Caribbean are generally grouped as a part or subregion of North America.<ref>[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/atlas/index.html?Parent=sameri&Rootmap=&Mode=d&SubMode=w South America Atlas] National Geographic</ref><ref>[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/atlas/index.html?Parent=nameri&Rootmap=&Mode=d&SubMode=w North America Atlas] National Geographic</ref><ref>[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#americas Unstats] Americas</ref> The South American nations that border the Caribbean Sea <U+2014> including Colombia, [[Venezuela]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], and [[French Guiana]] <U+2014> are also known as [[Caribbean South America]].

South America is home to the world's highest [[waterfall]], [[Angel Falls]] in Venezuela; the largest river (by volume), the [[Amazon River]]; the longest mountain range, the [[Andes]] (whose highest mountain is [[Aconcagua]] at 6,962 m (22,841 ft)); the driest place on earth, the [[Atacama Desert]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0308/feature3/ |title=Atacama Desert @ National Geographic Magazine |publisher=Ngm.nationalgeographic.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremescience.com/DriestPlace.htm |title=Driest Place &#124; Driest Desert Atacama Desert |publisher=Extremescience.com |date=2007-01-25 |accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref><ref>http://quest.nasa.gov/challenges/marsanalog/egypt/AtacamaAdAstra.pdf</ref> the largest rainforest, the [[Amazon Rainforest]]; the highest capital city, [[La Paz, Bolivia]]; the highest commercially navigable lake in the world, [[Lake Titicaca]]; and, excluding research stations in [[Antarctica]], the world's southernmost permanently inhabited community, [[Puerto Toro, Chile]].

South America's major mineral resources are [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], [[iron ore]], [[tin]], and [[petroleum]]. The many resources of South America have brought high income to its countries especially in times of war or of rapid economic growth by industrialized countries elsewhere. However, the concentration in producing one major export [[commodity]] often has hindered the development of diversified economies. The fluctuation in the price of commodities in the international markets has led historically to major highs and lows in the economies of South American states, often causing extreme political instability. This is leading to efforts to diversify production to drive away from staying as economies dedicated to one major export.

South America is one of the most biodiverse continents on earth. South America is home to many interesting and unique species of animals including the [[llama]], [[anaconda]], [[piranha]], [[jaguar]], [[vicu<U+00F1>a]], and [[tapir]]. The Amazon rainforests possess high [[biodiversity]], containing a major proportion of the earth's [[species]]. Regions in South America include the [[Andean States]], the [[Guiana]]s, the [[Southern Cone]], and [[Brazil]] which is the largest country by far, in both area and population.

==Demographics==
Descendants of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous peoples]], such as the [[Quechua]] and [[Aymara]], make up the majority of the population in [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pe.html |title=CIA World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bl.html |title=CIA World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref> and are a significant element in most other former Spanish colonies.

People of [[White people|European descent]] are a majority in [[Argentina]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/ar.html |title=CIA World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref> [[Uruguay]], to a lesser extent [[Brazil]], and [[Demographics of Chile|Chile]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umng.edu.co/www/resources/idsocial.doc |title=SOCIAL IDENTITY Marta Fierro Social Psychologist. |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref><ref>[http://www.iidh.ed.cr/comunidades/diversidades/docs/div_docpublicaciones/Derecho%20Indigena/Cap.%202.%20Pensar%20a%20los%20indios,%20tarea%20de%20criollos.pdf massive immigration of European Argentina Uruguay Chile Brazil]</ref><ref>[http://revistas.ucm.es/fll/02104547/articulos/ALHI8383110228A.PDF Latinoamerica.]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geografia.fflch.usp.br/publicacoes/Geousp/Geousp13/Geousp13_Intercambio_Maurel.htm |title=Argentina, como Chile y Uruguay, su poblaci<U+00F3>n est<U+00E1> formada casi exclusivamente por una poblaci<U+00F3>n blanca e blanca mestiza procedente del sur de Europa, m<U+00E1>s del 90% E.

[[Mestizos]] (mixed white and Amerindian) are the largest ethnic group in [[Paraguay]], [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], and [[Ecuador]]. Suriname is the only country in South America where Asians form the majority of the population. Brazil followed by Peru also have the biggest Japanese and Chinese communities in South America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080115i1.html=search.japantimes.co.jp |title=Japan Times |publisher=Search.japantimes.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref>

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of South America}}

Because of histories of high [[inflation]] in nearly all South American countries, [[interest rate]]s remain high and investment remains low. Interest rates are usually twice that of the United States. For example, interest-rates are about 22% in Venezuela and 23% in Suriname. The exception is Chile, which has been implementing free market economic policies since establishing military dictatorship in 1973 and has been increasing its social spending since the return of democratic rule in the early 1990s. This has led to economic stability and interest rates in the low single digits.

South America relies heavily on the exporting of goods and natural resources. On an [[exchange rate]] basis Brazil (the seventh largest economy in the world and the second largest in America) leads the way in total amount of exports at $137.8 billion dollars followed by Chile at 58.12 billion and Argentina with 46.46 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2078rank.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook - Rank Order - Exports |publisher=Cia.gov |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref>

The [[Economic inequality|economic gap]] between the rich and poor in most South American nations is considered to be larger than in most other continents. In Venezuela, Paraguay, Bolivia and many other South American countries, the richest 20% may own over 60% of the nation's wealth, while the poorest 20% may own less than 5%. This wide gap can be seen in many large South American cities where makeshift shacks and slums lie adjacent to skyscrapers and upper-class luxury apartments.

At the beginning of August 2008, Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chavez]] and his colleagues from Argentina and Brazil spoke about Latin American integration. At that time, Chavez put forth an ambitious idea; he proposed the construction of a [[railway]] that would connect [[Caracas]] with [[Buenos Aires]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/09/train-to-cross-south-america-southern-train-venezuela-argentina.php |title=Train across South America |publisher=Treehugger.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref>

==Tourism==
[[Tourism]] has increasingly become a significant source of income for many South American countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigtravelweb.com/travel/2008/10/13/tourism-trends-visitor-numbers/ |title=Bigtravelweb |publisher=Bigtravelweb |date=2008-10-13 |accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref><ref>[http://bibemp2.us.es/turismo/turismonet1/economia%20del%20turismo/turismo%20zonal/america%20del%20sur/tourism%20and%20economic%20growth%20in%20latin%20america.pdf Latin American tourism growth]</ref> Historical relics, architectural and natural wonders, a diverse range of foods and culture, vibrant and colorful cities, and stunning landscapes attract millions of tourists every year to South America. Some of the most visited places in the region are [[Machu Picchu]], the [[Amazon Rainforest]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], Buenos Aires, [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]]. Angel Falls, [[Cuzco, Peru|Cuzco]], [[Lake Titicaca]], [[Torres del Paine National Park|Patagonia]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] and the [[Gal<U+00E1>pagos islands]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gosouthamerica.about.com/od/topdestinations/tp/Attractions2006.htm |title=Top attractions |publisher=Gosouthamerica.about.com |date=2007-12-04 |accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref><ref>[http://www.vipbackpackers.com/DestInfo/139/South_America_Destination_South_America.aspx Backpackers destination]{{dead link|date=April 2009}}</ref>

==Culture==
[[File:Fiesta Palenque.jpg|thumb|Fiesta in Palenque. [[Afro-Colombian]] tradition from [[San Basilio de Palenque]], a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] since 2005.]]

South Americans are culturally influenced by the historic connection with Europe, especially [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], and the impact of [[mass culture]] from the [[United States of America]].

South American nations have a rich variety of [[Latin American music|music]]. Some of the most famous genres include [[cumbia]] from Colombia, [[samba]] and [[bossa nova]] from Brazil, and [[tango music|tango]] from Argentina and Uruguay. Also well known is the non-commercial folk genre [[Nueva Canci<U+00F3>n]] movement which was founded in Argentina and Chile and quickly spread to the rest of the Latin America. People on the Peruvian coast created the fine [[guitar]] and [[cajon]] duos or trios in the most [[mestizo]] (mixed) of South American rhythms such as the Marinera (from Lima), the [[Tondero]] (from Piura), the 19th century popular Creole Valse or Peruvian Valse, the soulful Arequipan Yaravi, and the early 20th century Paraguayan [[Guarania (music)|Guarania]]. In the late 20th century, [[Rock en Espa<U+00F1>ol|Spanish rock]] emerged by young hipsters influenced by British pop and American rock. [[Music of Brazil|Brazil]] has a Portuguese-language pop rock industry as well a great variety of other music genres.

The [[Spanish American literature|literature]] of South America has attracted considerable critical and popular acclaim, especially with the [[Latin American Boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of authors such as [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Gabriel Garc<U+00ED>a M<U+00E1>rquez]] in novels, and [[Pablo Neruda]] and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in other genres.

Because of South America's broad ethnic mix, [[Latin American cuisine|South American cuisine]] takes on African, American Indian, Asian, and European influences. [[Bahia]], Brazil, is especially well-known for its West African-influenced cuisine. Argentines, Chileans, Uruguayans, Brazilians and Venezuelans regularly consume wine, while Argentina along with Paraguay, Uruguay, and people in southern Chile and Brazil enjoy [[mate]], a regional brewed herb cultivated for its drink, the Paraguayan version, [[terere]], differing from the others in that it's served cold. [[Pisco]] is a liquor distilled from grapevine produced in Peru and Chile; however, there is a recurring dispute between those countries regarding its origins. Peruvian cuisine mixes elements from Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, African, Andean, and Amazonic food.

===Language===
[[File:Map-Romance Latin America.png|thumb|Romance languages in Latin America: '''<span style="color:#00b927;">Green</span>'''-Spanish; '''<span style="color:#ff8400;">Orange</span>'''-Portuguese; '''<span style="color:blue;">Blue</span>'''-French]]

[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are the most spoken languages in South America, a geographic region which is part of the bigger cultural region of [[Latin America]]. Portuguese is the official language of Brazil, which holds over 50% of the South American population. Spanish is the official language of most countries of the continent. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is the official language of [[Suriname]]; [[English language|English]] is the official language of [[Guyana]], although there are at least twelve other languages spoken in the country such as [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. English is also spoken in the [[Falkland Islands]]. [[French language|French]] is the official language of [[French Guiana]].

[[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Indigenous languages]] of South America include [[Quechua]] in Ecuador, Peru, Chile Argentina and Bolivia; [[Guarani language|Guaran<U+00ED>]] in Paraguay and, to a much less extent, in Bolivia; [[Aymara]] in Bolivia, Peru, and less often in Chile; and [[Mapudungun]] is spoken in certain pockets of southern Chile and, more rarely, Argentina. At least three South American indigenous languages (Quechua, Aymara, and Guarani) are recognized along with Spanish as national languages.

Other languages found in South America include [[Tamil language|Tamil]], Hindi and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] in Suriname; [[Italian language|Italian]] in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Chile; and [[German language|German]] in certain pockets of Argentina, Chile, Venezuela and Paraguay. German is also spoken in many regions of the southern states of Brazil, [[Riograndenser Hunsr<U+00FC>ckisch]] being the most widely spoken German dialect in the country; among other Germanic dialects, a Brazilian form of [[Pomeranian language|Pomeranian]] is also well represented and is experiencing a revival. [[Welsh language|Welsh]] remains spoken and written in the historic towns of [[Trelew]] and [[Rawson]] in the Argentine [[Patagonia]]. There are also small clusters of [[Japanese language|Japanese]]-speakers in Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, and Ecuador. [[Arabic]] speakers, often of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]], [[Demographics of Syria|Syrian]], or [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] descent, can be found in Arab communities in Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina, and less frequently in Colombia and Paraguay.

In most of the continent's countries, the upper classes and well-educated people regularly study English, French, German, or Italian, and are typically well-traveled. In those areas where tourism is a significant industry, English and some other European languages are often spoken. There are small Portuguese speaking areas in northernmost Uruguay because of the proximity of Brazil.
