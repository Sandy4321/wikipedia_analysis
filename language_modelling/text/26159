'''Edmund "Ed" Jew''' ({{zh-tsp|s=<U+8D75><U+60A6><U+660E>|t=<U+8D99><U+60A6><U+660E>|p=Zh<U+00E0>o Yu<U+00E8>m<U+00ED>ng}}, born 1960 in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]) is a [[Chinese American]] politician based in San Francisco. He graduated from [[San Francisco State University]] with a degree in [[economics]] and later earned a master degree in [[Administration (business)|business administration]] at [[Golden Gate University]]. After spending several years as a businessman managing his family businesses, he entered politics in 1980s and went on to serve in various community organizations. In 1996, he was the volunteer liaison for then District 4 supervisor [[Leland Yee]]. When Yee's successor [[Fiona Ma]] resigned to run for state assemblywoman, he decided to run for supervisor in District 4, which comprises most of the [[Sunset District, San Francisco, California|Sunset District]].

He was elected to the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] after capturing 52% of the votes in November 2006. Several months after taking office, the FBI raided his office and homes for allegedly extorting money from small business owners in his district. Shortly after the raid, the city attorney began investigating Jew for violating residency requirements necessary to hold his supervisor position. In September 2007, he was suspended by Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] and later resigned in the face of extortion and perjury charges. In late 2008, he pled guilty to both charges. He was sentenced to 64 months in state prison for extortion, and a year in county jail for perjury.<ref name="sentencing">{{cite news

== Personal life ==
Edmund Jew was born in San Francisco, California in 1960. The Jew family emigrated from [[People's Republic of China|China]] around the turn of the century. His grandfather James Jew, who arrived to the city in 1913, established an employment agency in 1925 and later the Canton Flower Shop in [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] in 1927. He had became a distinguished leader in the Chinese community after serving many local Chinese American associations.<ref name=bio>{{cite web

He was raised in Chinatown by his parents. When he was eight, he fell into a coma and had brain surgery as a result of being hit by a motorcycle.<ref name="sentencing"/> After graduating from [[San Francisco School of the Arts|McAteer High School]], Jew attended [[City College of San Francisco]] and [[San Francisco State University]], where he earned a degree in [[economics]]. In 1984, he also earned a [[Master of Business Administration]] degree from [[Golden Gate University]].<ref name=bio/>

Before entering politics, Jew was interested in entrepreneurship. Besides running his family flower shop and owning a local taxi company named Howard Mock Jew, Inc., he also founded numerous enterprises. In addition, he was interested in real estate. He bought his first property in San Francisco at the age of 21 and, as of 2002, he had a real estate portfolio worth as much as $5 million.<ref name=bio/> It was later revealed in news reports that beside owning several houses in the Bay Area, he also purchased properties in Arizona. In 2007, he transferred most of his properties to family members and his family trust due to his legal problems.<ref name=property>{{cite web | title = Ed Jew started property transfers as charges loomed | url = http://www.examiner.com/a-1345748~Ed_Jew_started_property_transfers_as_charges_loomed.html | work = San Francisco Examiner | first = Joshua | last = Sabatini | date = April 17, 2008 | accessdate = April 6, 2009}}</ref>

Jew married his wife, Lorene Jew and they have a daughter named Cammie. They live in the Sunset District and in [[Burlingame, California]].<ref name=bio/><ref name="address"/> He also has a brother named David Jew.<ref name=property/>

== Political career ==
Jew began his political career in the 1980s, setting up the Chinese Neighborhood Resource Center, which helped to clean up alleyways in Chinatown. He was then appointed by the mayor to serve on the Ten Year Plan Council to End Chronic Homelessness and the Office of Aging Advisory Council, the later oversaw the city's senior services. Like his grandfather, Jew was heavily involved in local Chinese Americans politics, serving as president of the Jew Family Benevolent Association, the Yeong Wo Benevolent Association, the Hay Sen Benevolent Association, the Hip Sen Benevolent Association, and the Lung Kong Benevolent Association. He was also an active participant of numerous other community organizations, namely the Northeast Community Federal Credit Union, the Chinese Holocaust Museum, the Sunset Residents Association, and the Sunset Parkside Education and Action Committee.<ref name=bio/>

From 1996 to 2001, Jew was former District 4 supervisor and current [[California State Senate|state senator]] [[Leland Yee]]'s volunteer community liaison.<ref>{{cite web | first=Bonnie | last=Eslinger | title=Ed Jew: Associate may be source of probe | url=http://www.examiner.com/a-743415~Associate_of_Ed_Jew__possible_source_of_investigation.html | work=San Francisco Examiner | publisher= | date=May 23, 2007 | accessdate=April 5, 2009}}</ref> In August 2006, Jew became interested to run for the vacant seat left by [[Fiona Ma]], who resigned as supervisor to run for the [[California State Assembly]].<ref name=timeline>{{cite web | first= | last= | title=The fast rise and fall of Ed Jew | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/01/10/BAVFUD56A.DTL | work=San Francisco Chronicle | publisher= | date=January 11, 2008 | accessdate=April 5, 2009}}</ref> In the election, Jew captured 52% of the votes and was elected supervisor of District 4, narrowly defeating [[Ron Dudum]] who received 48% of the votes.<ref>{{cite web | first=Charlie | last=Goodyear | title=S.F. supes: Ed Jew in District 4; Daly slips in | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/11/11/BAGETMAKBO1.DTL | work=San Francisco Chronicle | publisher= | date=November 11, 2006 | accessdate=April 5, 2009}}</ref> In December, Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] appointed Jew to serve out the remainder of Ma's term.

== Controversies ==
=== FBI raid and extortion allegations ===
On May 18, 2007, six months after Jew took office as supervisor, agents from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), with a federal warrant, raided his office at [[San Francisco City Hall|City Hall]], his houses in San Francisco and Burlingame, and his Chinatown flower shop. In the raid, the FBI went through computers and records searching for evidences regarding to what they termed "potentially criminal allegations."<ref name="Raid"> {{cite web |author=Buchanan, Wyatt,  Selna, Robert & Vega, Cecilia M. | title = FBI questions S.F. supervisor, searches office | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/05/19/EDJEW.TMP | work =  San Francisco Chronicle | date =May 18, 2007 | accessdate = May 18, 2007}} </ref>

Jew said that he had referred the owners of a chained [[bubble tea|tapioca drink]] shop, [[Quickly]], to a man named Robert Chan from the Bridge Consulting to resolve their permit issues. After several weeks, the owners paid $40,000 owed to Chan to Jew himself. Jew claimed that he has turned over the money to the consultant and asked half to be donated to the Friends of Sunset Playground, a local organization set up to raise money for the renovation of a playground located at 28th Avenue and Lawton Street in San Francisco. The $10,000 donation, which was made to the group nearly a month after Jew received the money, was rejected by the group's fiscal agency after the FBI raid.<ref name="Raid"/><ref name="CBS5">{{cite web | title = Caught on Tape: FBI Raids SF Supervisors' Office | url = http://cbs5.com/topstories/local_story_138220449.html | publisher = CBS5 | date = May 18, 2007 | accessdate =May 19, 2007 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070521062915/http://cbs5.com/topstories/local_story_138220449.html | archivedate=May 21, 2007 }}</ref>

In June 2007, the Quickly owners told the press that it was Jew who first approached them about the money issue. They claimed that they have never handed over their own money. Instead, the money was supplied by the FBI. In fact, a law enforcement official close to the investigation leaked that the FBI used a undercover agent to meet with Jew to hand over the money.<ref>{{cite web |author=Matier, Phillip & Ross, Andrew.| title = FBI's cash paid Ed Jew, source says | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/06/10/MNGR0QC65G1.DTL | work =San Francisco Chronicle | date =June 10, 2007 | accessdate =June 10, 2007}}</ref>

On September 20, 2007, federal prosecutors officially charged Jew with one count of mail fraud in connection with extorting $80,000 from Quickly.<ref>{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Elias| title =Feds charge SF lawmaker with trying to extort $80K | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/09/20/state/n131148D72.DTL | work =San Francisco Chronicle | date =September 20, 2007 | accessdate =September 20, 2007}}</ref> Jew denied any wrongdoing and pled not guilty to mail fraud. His attorney Steven Gruel said that the federal case was weak and questioned what influences Jew could have had over the issuing of permits. He also said that Jew had no intention of resigning despite calls from Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] asking him to resign. If convicted of the fraud charge, Jew could have faced up to 20 years of imprisonment.<ref>{{cite web |first=Marcus |last=Wohlsen| title =San Francisco supervisor pleads not guilty to fraud charge | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/09/21/state/n100313D23.DTL | work =San Francisco Chronicle | date =September 21, 2007 | accessdate =September 21, 2007}}</ref> On November 7, 2007, a federal grand jury added five felony charges, replacing the previous single mail fraud charge. The charges included two counts each of bribery and mail fraud and one count of extortion. He was also accused of accepting $4,000 in cash from the owner of Wonderful Desserts and Cafe. Gruel said that his client denied these allegations and would plead not guilty.<ref>{{cite web |first=Bob |last=Egelko| title =Supervisor Ed Jew hit with 5 new charges in federal indictment | url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/11/07/MN3IT7BRN.DTL | work =San Francisco Chronicle | date =November 7, 2007 | accessdate =November 7, 2007}}</ref>

In December 2007, Gruel exited the case. It was later revealed that Gruel had a conflict of interest because he had previously been a federal prosecutor and a lawyer of Jew's "political opponent" Leland Yee. Gruel refused to comment citing attorney-client confidentiality.<ref>{{cite web |first=Julia |last=Cheever| title =Jew seeks hearing in extortion case | url =http://www.fogcityjournal.com/news_in_brief/bcn_ed_jew_080220.shtml | work =Fog City Journal | date =February 20, 2008 | accessdate =February 20, 2008}}</ref>

=== Residency requirements violation ===
[[File:DennisHerreraEdJewLetter.JPG|thumb|One of the letter sent by Herrera to Jew's defense attorney requesting the supervisor to provide more evidences regarding his residency]]
In late May 2007, questions about whether or not Jew met the residency requirements needed for his supervisor position were raised when new information emerged suggesting that he did not live in his San Francisco home.<ref name="resident 1">{{cite web |author=Buchanan, Wyatt, Selna, Robert & Vega, Cecilia M. | title = S.F. supervisor is investigated over question of city residency | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/05/22/EDJEW.TMP | work = San Francisco Chronicle | date =May 22, 2007 | accessdate =May 22, 2007}}</ref> Jew's neighbors said that the house claimed as Jew's residence had been vacated and utility bills showed low usage of water as well as electricity. Although Jew had stated that the house was owned by his father and that it might appear that he did not live there because he spent most of his time at his flower shop, he was not able to provide more information in response to City Attorney Dennis Herrera's formal requests.<ref name="resident 2">{{cite web |author=Buchanan, Wyatt & Vega, Cecilia M. | title = City attorney sets deadline for supervisor| url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/05/24/BAGI7Q0JS31.DTL | work = San Francisco Chronicle | date =May 24, 2007 | accessdate =May 24, 2007}}</ref><ref name="resident 3">{{cite web |author=Vega, Cecilia M. | title =Ed Jew fails to satisfy city on residence | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/06/12/MNGHKQDN2K1.DTL | work = San Francisco Chronicle | date =June 12, 2007 | accessdate =June 12, 2007}}</ref>

On June 12, 2007, San Francisco District Attorney [[Kamala Harris]] formally issued a warrant for the arrest of Ed Jew.  The nine counts of felony charges brought against Jew included four counts of perjury, three counts of election code violations, voter fraud, and providing false documents when he filed in candidacy papers claiming that he was a resident of the Sunset district.<ref name="charges">{{cite web |first=Joshua |last=Sabatini | title = Jew's lawyer rips local probe as 'politically driven' | url =http://www.examiner.com/a-777880~Jew_s_lawyer_rips_local_probe_as__politically_driven_.html | work = San Francisco Examiner | date =June 19, 2007 | accessdate =June 19, 2007}}</ref> Later on the same date, Jew turned himself in to the Burlingame Police Department with bail set at $135,000. His attorney Steven Gruel said that Jew denied these allegations and explained that his client surrendered in Burlingame because of convenience.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jesse |last=McKinley | title = San Francisco Fights Official Over Residency | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E5DA143FF937A25755C0A9619C8B63 | work = [[The New York Times]] | date =June 14, 2007 | accessdate =April 5, 2009}}</ref>

On June 18, 2007, City Attorney Dennis Herrera officially sought approval from [[California Attorney General]] [[Jerry Brown]] to file a lawsuit to remove Ed Jew from office. Citing records that showed little use of utilities and interviews of 32 neighbors, he declared that the supervisor had violated the residency requirements of the City Charter.<ref>{{cite web |author=Buchanan, Wyatt & Lagos, Marisa. | url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/06/18/BAGFHQH9D88.DTL | title = City Attorney moves to remove Ed Jew from office | work = San Francisco Chronicle | date =June 18, 2007 | accessdate =June 18, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/06/18/state/n122626D03.DTL | title =City attorney looks to file lawsuit to oust embattled supervisor | work =San Francisco Chronicle | date =June 18, 2007 | accessdate =June 18, 2007}}</ref> Mayor Gavin Newsom said the case against Jew was "very damning" and urged the supervisor to explain himself. He also raised concern about Jew continuing to cast votes while the legitimacy of his residency was in question and said that he was reviewing city law to find out what power he had to remove Jew from office.<ref>{{cite web |first=Cecilia M.|last=Vega| url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/06/20/MNGSLQIDF51.DTL | title =Mayor to Ed Jew: 'Prove It' | work =San Francisco Chronicle | date =June 20, 2007 | accessdate =June 20, 2007}}</ref>

On July 4, 2007, Jew's attorneys issued a 138-page response to Herrera's petition arguing that even if Jew had not lived full time in his home in District 4, his election has not violated any laws. They also accused Herrara of bias and of being politically motivated in bringing charges against Jew.<ref>{{cite web |author=Vega, Cecilia M. & Wildermuth, John. | url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/07/04/MNG42QQSU41.DTL | title =Ed Jew's lawyers reply to charges | work =San Francisco Chronicle | date =July 11, 2007 | accessdate =July 11, 2007}}</ref> Herrera denied Jew's accusations, calling it a desperate act. He also disclosed new evidences to the media suggesting his residency violation including signed bank loan documents which identified Jew's address in Burlingame.<ref name="address">{{cite web | url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/07/14/MNGMKR0LJK1.DTL | title =City attorney toughens case against Ed Jew | work =San Francisco Chronicle | date =July 14, 2007 | accessdate =July 14, 2007}}</ref>

On July 17, 2007, Jew pled not guilty to the perjury charges. His attorney asked Superior Court Judge Harold Kahn to repeal his $135,000 bail saying that he was not a flight risk. He also waived his right for a speedy trial on behalf of Jew. Kahn agreed to void the bail after Jew agreed to surrender his passport.<ref>{{cite web |author=Buchanan, Wyatt & Vega, Cecilia M. | url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/07/17/MNG0OR1N5E1.DTL | title =Ed Jew Surprises D.A., Pushes for Quick Trial | work =San Francisco Chronicle | date =July 17, 2007 | accessdate =July 19, 2007}}</ref>

During the preliminary hearing in late July, prosecutors presented testimonies from Jew's neighbors at both of his homes, indicating that Jew had never lived in his 28th Avenue apartment and spent most of his time in Burlingame. Testimony from a [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]] inspector also indicated that Jew's first-class mail went to Burlingame while junk mail went to his San Francisco address. Finally, prosecutors cited records including utility bills showing low usage of water and electricity at his home in 28th Avenue, as well as loan applications that indicate he lived in Burlingame. In defense, Jew's attorney presented a jury duty summons to indicate his address in San Francisco. He also questioned the possible bias in the testimonies of witnesses.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jaxon |last=Van Derbeken | url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/07/31/BA5KR9UBR2.DTL | title =Witnesses, loan application undermine Ed Jew's claims | work =San Francisco Chronicle | date =July 31, 2007 | accessdate =August 3, 2007}}</ref> On August 2, 2007, Kahn ruled there was sufficient evidence to compel Jew to stand trial. If convicted on any one of the charges, Jew would have been removed from office.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jaxon |last=Van Derbeken | url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/08/02/MNVMRBFPH1.DTL | title =Felony perjury trial set for Ed Jew | work =San Francisco Chronicle | date =August 2, 2007 | accessdate =August 3, 2007}}</ref>

In October, defense attorney Bill Fazio exited the case, citing "irreconcilable differences." In a written note, Jew agreed that he did not oppose Fazio's exit and that they have mutual consent. Jew's trial was postponed to give him more time to seek another legal counsel.<ref>{{cite web |first=Wyatt |last=Buchanan | url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/04/BAR7SJ8PI.DTL |title=Supervisor Jew's defense attorney wants to quit case | work =San Francisco Chronicle|date=October 4, 2007|accessdate=November 9, 2007}}</ref>

On September 25, 2007, Mayor Gavin Newsom suspended Jew for alleged official misconduct and began the process of removing him from office. Jew was also served with an outline drawn by the city attorney regarding charges of misconduct for allegedly lying about where he lived. Deputy budget director [[Carmen Chu]] was appointed as a temporary replacement for Jew on the SF Board of Supervisors.<ref name="suspension">{{cite web |author=Vega, Cecilia M., Wildermuth, John, Curiel, Jonathan & King, John. | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/09/25/BAKFSDP3D.DTL | title=Supervisor Ed Jew suspended from office| work=San Francisco Chronicle| date=September 25, 2007 | accessdate=September 25, 2007}}</ref>

On January 10, 2008, Jew tendered his resignation effective immediately in exchange for Herrera and Newsom dropping both the civil lawsuit and misconduct proceeding before the Ethics Commission regarding his residency violation. In a letter, he noted that he resigned because of tremendous legal expenses and has sworn never to seek public office ever again in his best interest of his family. He still faced more serious federal criminal prosecution and other civil litigation. Chu became Jew's successor until the election in November 2008.<ref name="resignation">{{cite web |author=Vega, Cecilia M., Wildermuth, John. | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/01/10/BA19UD1T2.DTL | title=Ed Jew tenders resignation| work=San Francisco Chronicle| date=January 10, 2008 | accessdate=January 10, 2008}}</ref>

=== Guilty plea and sentencing ===
On October 10, 2008, Jew pled guilty in federal court to the mail fraud and extortion charges, which has a maximum sentence of up to a decade.<ref name="guilty_a">{{cite web | last=Buchanan | first=Wyatt | title=Former S.F. supervisor pleads guilty to federal extortion, bribery, plans to accuse others | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/10/BARK13EVU2.DTL | work=San Francisco Chronicle | publisher= | date=October 10, 2008 | accessdate=October 10, 2008}}</ref> A month later on November 18, 2008, he pled guilty in state court to perjury charges regarding his residency violation after accepting a plea bargain that could spare him from serving more time than what he gets in the federal case.

On April 3, 2009, Jew was sentenced to 64 months in state prison and fined $10,000 for extortion. The sentence was longer than the one prosecutors had asked for; prosecutors had originally sought a 57-month prison term, saying that he "preyed upon and victimized the very people whom he had proposed to support in his campaign: small business owners in the Sunset District."<ref name="sentencing"/> On April 22, he was sentenced to 1 year in county jail, 3 years in probation and fined $2,000 for perjury.<ref name="sentencing2"/> He must surrender to authorities and begin his prison sentence by July 1.<ref name="sentencing"/>
