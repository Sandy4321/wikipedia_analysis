'''Tiberios III''' (or '''Tiberius III''') ({{lang-el|<U+03A4><U+03B9><U+03B2><U+03AD><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+0393>'}}) (died 15 February 706)<ref name="Kazhdan, pg. 2084">Kazhdan, pg. 2084</ref> was [[Byzantine emperor]] from 698 to 21 August 705.<ref>Dumbarton Oaks, pg. 624</ref>  Although his rule was considered generally successful, especially in containing the Arab threat to the east, he was overthrown by the former emperor [[Justinian II]] and subsequently executed.

==Rise to power==
Tiberius was a Germanic naval officer from the region of [[Pamphylia]] and originally named '''Apsimaros''' (<U+0391><U+03C8><U+03AF><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>),<ref name="Canduci, pg. 200">Canduci, pg. 200</ref> who rose to the position of ''[[droungarios]]'' of the [[Cibyrrhaeotic Theme]].<ref name="Moore, Tiberius III">Moore, ''Tiberius III''</ref>  He participated in the failed campaign to [[Battle of Carthage (698)|regain Carthage]] in 698. As admiral [[John the Patrician]] retreated from [[Carthage]] to [[Crete]], the fleet rebelled, deposed and murdered their commander,<ref name="Moore, Tiberius III">Moore, ''Tiberius III''</ref> and chose Apsimaros as his replacement.<ref name="Norwich, pg. 334">Norwich, pg. 334</ref>  Changing his name to Tiberios,<ref name="Bury, pg. 354">Bury, pg. 354</ref> Apsimaros sailed on [[Constantinople]] which was suffering from a plague and proceeded to besiege it.<ref name="Bury, pg. 354">Bury, pg. 354</ref>

His revolution attracted the support of the Green faction,<ref name="Norwich, pg. 334">Norwich, pg. 334</ref> as well as detachments from the field army and the imperial guard, and officers loyal to him opened the gates of the city and proclaimed him emperor, after which his troops the proceeded to pillage the city.<ref name="Bury, pg. 354">Bury, pg. 354</ref>  When he was firmly established on the throne, he commanded that the nose of deposed Emperor [[Leontios|Leontius]] be cut off, and ordered him to enter the [[monastery]] of Psamathion.<ref name="Norwich, pg. 334">Norwich, pg. 334</ref>  Leontios had also mutilated his predecessor [[Justinian II]] in the same fashion three years earlier.<ref name="Canduci, pg. 200">Canduci, pg. 200</ref>

==Reign and deposition==
As emperor, Tiberios III made the tactical decision to ignore [[Africa]], where Carthage was now definitively lost.<ref name="Moore, Tiberius III">Moore, ''Tiberius III''</ref>  Instead, he appointed his brother [[Heraclius (brother of Tiberius III)|Herakleios]] as ''[[monostrategos]]'' of the East, who firstly strengthened the land and sea defences of [[Anatolia]]<ref name="Norwich, pg. 334">Norwich, pg. 334</ref> before proceeding to attack the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] under [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]], winning minor victories while raiding into northern [[Syria]] in 700 and 701.<ref>Bury, pg. 355</ref>  He then proceeded to invade and for a period hold territory in [[Armenia]], while Arab reprisals in 703 and 704 were repelled from [[Cilicia]] with heavy Arab losses.<ref name="Norwich, pg. 334">Norwich, pg. 334</ref>

Success in the military sphere was accompanied by Tiberios<U+2019> attempt to strengthen the empire militarily by reorganizing its administration.<ref name="Moore, Tiberius III">Moore, ''Tiberius III''</ref>  Tiberius then turned his attention to the Island of [[Cyprus]], which had been underpopulated since the reign of Justinian II.<ref name="Bury, pg. 356">Bury, pg. 356</ref>  He sent a delegation to the Caliph at [[Damascus]], asking for the return of many Cypriot prisoners who had been captured near the [[Propontis]], and subsequently returned them to their place of birth. He strengthened the defence of the island at the same time by increasing the garrison numbers with troops from the [[Taurus Mountains]].<ref name="Bury, pg. 356">Bury, pg. 356</ref>  He also reorganized the Cibyrrhaeotic Theme<ref name="Bury, pg. 356">Bury, pg. 356</ref> and repaired the sea walls of Constantinople.<ref name="Kazhdan, pg. 2084">Kazhdan, pg. 2084</ref>

Domestically, his only known act of note was the banishment of [[Philippikos Bardanes]], the son of a notable patrician, to the island of [[Cephalonia]]. Philippikos, a future emperor, had dreamed that his head was overshadowed by an eagle, which Tiberios took to mean that he was planning to rebel against him.<ref>Bury, pg. 357</ref>

Meanwhile, in 704, [[Justinian II]] escaped from exile in [[Cherson]],<ref name="Moore, Tiberius III">Moore, ''Tiberius III''</ref> fleeing to the court of the [[khagan]] of the [[Khazars]], [[Busir Glavan]].<ref>Norwich, pg. 335</ref>  Tiberios paid a bounty to Busir to have Justinian killed,<ref>Bury, pg. 358</ref> but Justinian, who had married the khagan's sister and been warned by her, escaped.<ref>Bury, pg. 359</ref>  Seeking the aid of [[Tervel of Bulgaria]], he eventually made his way back to Constantinople at the head of [[Slav]] and [[Bulgar]] army in 705.<ref name="Norwich, pg. 336">Norwich, pg. 336</ref>  For three days, Justinian tried to convince the citizens of Constantinople to open the gates, but to no avail.<ref>Bury, pg. 360</ref>  In the meantime, his troops had discovered a long abandoned water conduit beneath the city walls, through which Justinian and some of his supporters managed to enter the city.<ref name="Norwich, pg. 336">Norwich, pg. 336</ref>  Hearing that Justinian had taken control of the [[Blachernae Palace]] in the night, Tiberios fled to [[Bithynia]] where he evaded capture for several months.<ref name="Norwich, pg. 337">Norwich, pg. 337</ref>

With his capture, Tiberios, together his brother Herakleios and the former emperor Leontios,<ref name="Kazhdan, pg. 2084">Kazhdan, pg. 2084</ref> were paraded in chains through the city streets before being presented before Justinian in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]].<ref name="Norwich, pg. 337">Norwich, pg. 337</ref>  There, before a jeering populace, Justinian placed his feet on the necks of Tiberios and Leontios in a symbolic gesture of subjugation before ordering their execution by beheading.<ref name="Moore, Tiberius III">Moore, ''Tiberius III''</ref>  Tiberios<U+2019> brother Herakleios, and many of the military commanders under him were subsequently hung.<ref>Bury, pg. 361</ref>
