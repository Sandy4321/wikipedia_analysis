{{main|PlayStation Portable Slim & Lite}}
At [[E3 2007]], Sony released information that a new version of the PSP would be released in [[September 2007]], for all regions.<ref name="NAprice" /> The redesigned PSP is 33% lighter and 19% thinner than the original PSP. The redesign also features composite TV Output, supports charging via USB, double the onboard RAM (32 MB to 64 MB), and has a brighter screen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.us.playstation.com/News/PressReleases/406| title=Sony Computer Entertainment America Outlines Plans for PlayStation<U+00AE> Platforms at E3 2007| date=2007-07-11| publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment| accessdate=2008-03-18}}</ref> It also [[cache]]s UMD data in memory to decrease game loading times. The WLAN switch has been moved to the top where the old IR receiver was to avoid accidental switching, and the speakers have been moved from the bottom of the screen to nearer the top, to prevent users from accidentally blocking the speakers with their hands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/sony-psp/| title=Review: Sony PSP (black/slim)| date=2007-09-10| first=John P.| last=Falcone| publisher=CNET| accessdate=2008-03-18}}</ref>

==Hardware==
{{main|PlayStation Portable hardware}}
[[Image:DSCF0510.jpg|thumb|A ceramic white PSP. The shoulder buttons are on top, the directional pad on the left with the analog 'nub' directly below it, the PlayStation face buttons on the right and a row of secondary buttons below the screen.]]
The PlayStation Portable measures approximately 17 x 7.3 x 2.2 cm (6.7 x 2.9 x 0.9 in) and weighs 280 grams (9.88 ounces). The front of the console is dominated by the system's 11 cm (4.3 in) [[LCD]] screen, which is capable of 480 x 272 pixel video playback with 16.77 million colors. Also on the front are the four PlayStation face buttons ([[Image:PlayStationTriangle.svg|Triangle]], [[Image:PlayStationCircle.svg|Circle]], [[Image:PlayStationX.svg|X]], [[Image:PlayStationSquare.svg|Square]]), the directional pad, the analog 'nub', and several other buttons. In addition, the system includes two shoulder buttons and a [[USB 2.0|USB 2.0 mini-B]] port on the top of the console and a [[Wireless LAN|WLAN]] switch and power cable input on the bottom. The back of the PSP features a read-only [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] drive for movies and games, and a reader compatible with Sony's [[Memory Stick Duo]] [[Flash memory|flash card]]s is located on the left of the system. Other features include an infrared port and [[IEEE 802.11b]] [[Wi-fi]] for access to the [[Internet]] and add-hoc multiplayer gaming and data transfer, built in stereo speakers, and a headphone port.<ref name="SCEAspecs" /> 

The PSP uses a 333 [[Hertz|MHz]] MIPS R4000 (32-bit) [[CPU]], a [[GPU]] with 2 [[Megabyte|MB]] onboard [[VRAM]] running at 166 MHz, and includes 32 MB main [[RAM]] and 4 MB embedded [[DRAM]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/542/542182p1.html| title=A New Tast of the PSP chips| date=2004-08-25| publisher=IGN| accessdate=2008-03-17}}</ref><ref name="SCEAspecs" /> The CPU was originally locked to run slower than the hardware was capable of and most games ran at at 222 MHz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3160506| title=PSP Brought up to Speed with 3.50 firmware| date=2007-06-22| first=Andrew| last=Hayward| publisher=1UP| accessdate=2008-03-17}}</ref> However, with firmware update 3.50 on [[May 31]], [[2007]], Sony removed this limit and allowed new games to run at a full 333 MHz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/47564| title=Sony Confirms Full PSP CPU Speed| date=2007-06-22| first=Chris| last=Faylor| publisher=Shacknews| accessdate=2008-03-17}}</ref>

==Software==
===System Software===
{{main|PlayStation Portable System Software}}
Each PSP runs a particular version of the PSP [[system software]] (Sony's name for the unit's [[firmware]]), which comprises the device's operating system and additional core functionality. System software updates can be obtained in four ways:
* Direct download to the PSP over [[Wi-Fi]]. This can be performed by choosing "Settings", "Network Update" from the [[Cross Media Bar|XMB]].
* Download to a PC, then transfer to the PSP via a [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] cable or [[Memory Stick]].
* Included on the [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] of most games. These games may not run with earlier firmware than the version on their UMD.
* Download from a PS3 or PS2 to a PSP system via USB cable. 
* Download from the PSP system to the PS3 or PS2 via USB cable.

While system software updates can be used with consoles from any region, Sony recommends only downloading system software updates released for the region corresponding to the system's place of purchase. System software updates have added various features including a web browser, [[Adobe Flash Player|Adobe Flash]] support, additional codecs for images, audio, and video, [[PlayStation 3]] connectivity, as well as patches against several security exploits, vulnerabilities, and execution of [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] programs.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=26662 | publisher=The Inquirer | title=Sony releases anti-piracy PSP update |date=3 October 2005}}</ref> As of [[March 18]], [[2008]], the latest version of the System Software is 3.93.

=== Interface ===
[[Image:XMBPSP.jpg|thumb|The PSP's [[XrossMediaBar]] (XMB) interface]]
The PSP's main menu interface is the "[[XrossMediaBar]]" (XMB) used by recent Sony TVs, the [[PSX (DVR)]] hardware, and the [[PlayStation 3]]. It consists of a horizontal sequence of icons, in this case Settings, Photo, Music, Video, Game, and Network, which show a vertical sequence of sub-icons when highlighted.

The XMB allows the user to adjust settings, connect the device to a PC (via [[USB]]), connect to and browse the [[Internet]], and play video, audio, and games. The XMB may be accessed at any time by pressing the Home button, but the PSP must exit the currently running application due to [[RAM|memory]] limitations, with the exception of music playback in the latest firmware release to allow picture viewing during music playback.

The PSP's default background color changes depending on the current month of the year. The user may also manually set the color or specify a background image from a connected Memory Stick (with firmware version 2.00+).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/635/635505p1.html | title=PS Meeting 2005: PSP 2.00 Details | publisher=IGN}}</ref> Firmware 3.70 and higher include the Custom Theme feature, which lets a user change everything in the interface (Icons, Background). Currently, there are 13 official themes: ''[[Lemmings]]'', ''[[Wipeout]]'', "Cookies", "Pink", six different themes based on the game ''[[Pursuit Force]]'', and three themes based on the game ''[[Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow]]''.

=== Web browser ===
[[Image:PSP Web Browser.png|thumb|right|The PSP web browser]]
The PSP Internet Browser is an [[embedded system|embedded]] [[Mobile browser|microbrowser]]. It is a version of the [[NetFront]] browser made by [[Access Co. Ltd.]] and was released for free with the 2.00 firmware upgrade on [[July 27]], [[2005]] in [[Japan]], [[August 24]], [[2005]] in [[North America]].

The browser supports most common web technologies, such as [[HTTP cookie]]s, [[Form (web)|form]]s, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], as well as basic [[JavaScript]] capabilities. However there is an input limit on form fields, making the entering of large amounts of text nearly impossible. Initial [[character encoding]] support was limited to [[ISO/IEC 8859-5|Cyrillic (ISO-8859-5)]], [[Extended Unix Code#EUC-JP|Japanese (EUC-JP)]], [[Shift-JIS|Japanese (Shift JIS)]], [[Extended Unix Code#EUC-KR|Korean (EUC-KR)]] and [[ISO/IEC 8859-1|Western (ISO-8859-1)]]. The version 2.50 firmware upgrade added [[UTF-8|Unicode (UTF-8)]] and Auto-Select as options in the browser's encoding menu, and also introduced the saving of input history for online forms. Version 2.60 added [[GB 18030|Simplified Chinese (GB18030)]] and [[Big5|Traditional Chinese (Big5)]] to the encoding menu. Version 2.70 of the PSP firmware also introduced basic [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] capabilities to the browser, however the player was only version 6, three iterations behind the current desktop version 9, making some websites impossible to view.

The browser has a very basic user interface consisting of two bars that are hidden during browsing and only displayed when the user taps "[[Image:PlayStationTriangle.svg|Triangle]]". The top bar of the interface displays the page title (which scrolls if it is too long to fit on the screen) and the current address.  The bottom bar displays 10 icons: File, Back, Forward, Refresh, Home, Bookmarks, History, View, Tools, and Help. File, Bookmarks, History, View, and Tools all open submenus while Help displays a diagram of the PSP system itself indicating the function of each button whilst using the browser.

There are 3 different rendering modes, "Normal", "Just-Fit", and "Smart-Fit". "Normal" will display the page with no changes, "Just-Fit" will attempt to shrink some elements to make the whole page fit on the screen and preserve layout (although this makes some pages extremely difficult to read), and "Smart-Fit" will display content in the order it appears in the HTML, and with no size adjustments; instead it will drop an element down below the preceding element if it starts to go off the screen.

The browser also has limited [[Tabbed document interface|tabbed browsing]] support, with a maximum of three tabs. Pages are opened in new tabs either when a website tries to open a link in a new window using the HTML command <code>target="blank"</code> or when the user selects a link and holds down "[[Image:PlayStationX.svg|X]]" rather than just tapping it. The user switches between tabs by holding "[[Image:PlayStationSquare.svg|Square]]" and tapping the shoulder buttons.

===Instant messenger===
A product named [[Go!Messenger]] is a free [[instant messenger]] program for the PlayStation Portable.<ref>[http://uk.playstation.com/games-media/news/articles/detail/item92866/Get-ready-to-chat/ PlayStation Games & Media News: - Get ready to chat<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It has been jointly developed by [[SCEE]] and [[British Telecom|BT]] and was launched with PSP Update 3.90. Note that only the icon has been added and the software for [[Go!Messenger]] can be downloaded in late February. The service is currently only available in Europe.

Go!Messenger  allows PSP users to:
*Send instant messages to each other
*Video chat
*Video chat with the [[Go!Cam]]
*Send video and voice messages to other PSP users

== Games ==
{{main|List of PlayStation Portable games|List of PlayStation Network games}}

In addition to playing PSP games, there have been new releases of downloadable [[PlayStation]] games that can be played via emulation for the PSP. Currently, the only two official ways to access this feature is through the [[PlayStation Network]] service for [[PlayStation 3]] or a PC.

=== Demos ===
{{main|List of PlayStation Portable game demos}}

Demos for commercial PSP games can be downloaded and booted directly from the [[Memory Stick#Memory Stick Duo and PRO Duo|Memory Stick PRO Duo]]. Demos are also sometimes issued in [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] format and mailed out or given to customers at various retail outlets as promotional content. Demos can also either be downloaded to a personal computer and later transferred into the "GAME" file on the PSP's Memory Stick or downloaded directly to the PSP using the PSP's system browser.

=== Greatest Hits titles ===
{{main|List of Sony Greatest Hits games}}

During [[E3]] 2006, Sony Computer Entertainment America announced that the Greatest Hits range of budget titles were to be extended to the PSP system. On [[July 25]], [[2006]], Sony CEA released the first batch of [[List of Sony Greatest Hits games|Greatest Hits]] titles.<ref name="PSPGH">{{cite web | url=http://www.us.playstation.com/News/PressReleases/344 | title=SCEA announces that PSP Greatest Hits are available for purchase | publisher=SCEA|accessdate=2006-08-04}}</ref> The PSP Greatest Hits lineup consist of games that have sold 250,000 copies or more and have been out for nine months. Every PSP game in this lineup retails for $19.99 each.

Sony Computer Entertainment Europe announced at around the same time the availability of a number of titles under the [[Platinum range]] for <U+20AC>24.99 each in the Eurozone and <U+00A3>19.99 in the UK.


==Homebrew development==
{{main|PlayStation Portable homebrew}}	 
In May 2005, it was found that PSPs using the 1.00 version of the firmware (meaning original, first launch Japanese-only PSPs) could execute [[unsigned code]]. What this meant in practice was that these PSPs could run homebrew software, as the mechanism for checking to make sure that software has been approved by Sony had not yet been activated.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} Later exploits have allowed for PSPs using later versions of Sony's firmware to run homebrew applications, and development of new exploits to bypass new restrictions to limit unauthorized programs is ongoing. Utilizing homebrew applications allows for a significant increase in functionality on the PSP, such as [[FLAC]] and [[Ogg Vorbis]] audio playback, emulation of dozens of different video game systems, and [[eBook]] viewing. Since the creation of the [[Pandora's Battery]] software by a conglomeration of PSP homebrew developers, any PSP may be hacked to utilize homebrew software, regardless of its firmware version.<ref>[http://pspupdates.qj.net/index.php?pg=49&aid=100579 Article Detail - PlayStation Portable News - PSP Updates<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== PlayStation Store ==
{{Main|PlayStation Store}}
The PlayStation Store for the PSP, an online shopping service similar to the PlayStation Store for the [[PlayStation 3]], was launched by SCEI on [[September 20]], [[2007]]. Content available from the store, either free or for a fee, includes game demos, trailers, emulated [[PlayStation]] games and other game related content. The service was originally only available in Japan. It was later launched in Taiwan and Hong Kong on [[November 21]], [[2007]], and in Europe on [[November 22]], [[2007]]. An update for the store where content can be purchased and downloaded directly to the PSP without a PC or PlayStation 3 is currently being developed.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2008/02/21/gdc_slide_psp_store_downloads/ |title = Wi-Fi downloads coming to the PSP |accessdate = 2008-02-23 |author = Sherwood, James |date = [[2008-02-21]] |publisher = [[The Register|Reg Hardware]] }}</ref>

==Controversial advertising campaigns==
*Sony admitted in late 2005 to hiring [[graffiti]] artists to spray paint advertisements for the PSP in seven major U.S. cities including [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. The mayor of Philadelphia has filed a [[cease and desist]] order and may file a criminal complaint. According to Sony, it is paying businesses and building owners for the right to graffiti their walls.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,69741,00.html Sony Draws Ire With PSP Graffiti]</ref>

*In 2006, Sony ran a poster campaign in [[England]]. One of the poster designs with the slogan "Take a running jump here" was removed from a [[Manchester Piccadilly station]] tram platform due to concerns that it might encourage suicide.<ref>{{cite news | title=No play station, say Metro bosses | publisher=[[Manchester Evening News]] | date=[[2006-03-07]] | url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/206/206881_no_play_station_say_metro_bosses.html | author=Clarissa Satchell | accessdate=2007-03-14}}</ref>

*News spread on in July 2006 of a billboard advertisement released in [[the Netherlands]] which depicted a literally [[white]] colored woman holding a similarly literally [[black]] colored woman by the jaw, saying "PlayStation Portable White is coming." Some found this to be racially charged due to the portrayal of a white woman subjugating a black woman. Two other similar advertisements also existed, one had the two women facing each other on equal footing in fighting stances, while the other had the black woman in a dominant position on top of the white woman. The stated purpose of the advertisements was to contrast the white and black versions of its game console available for sale. These ads were never released in the rest of the world, and were pulled from the Netherlands after the controversy was raised.<ref name="cnn">{{cite news | title=Sony PSP ads spark cries of racism | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=[[2006-07-05]] | url=http://money.cnn.com/blogs/browser/2006/07/sony-psp-ads-spark-cries-of-racism.html | author= Owen Thomas and Oliver Ryan | accessdate=2006-07-31}}</ref>

*Sony came under scrutiny online in December 2006 for a [[guerrilla marketing]] campaign hoping to go [[viral marketing|viral]], for the console, with advertisers masquerading as young bloggers who desperately wanted a PSP. The site was registered to and created by youth marketing company [[Zipatoni]] on behalf of Sony before it was taken down.

==Safety issues==
A 12-year-old boy suffered second degree burns to his leg after his PSP unit which was in his pocket overheated, spontaneously catching fire and melting onto his leg. Sony are investigating the incident and believe it to be an isolated issue. Ironically, the game in the switched-off PSP at the time was ''[[Burnout Legends]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/melting-psp-an-isolated-case-sony/2008/02/08/1202234120827.html |title = Boy burnt by melting game player |accessdate = 2008-02-23 |author = Moses, Asher |date = [[2008-02-08]] |publisher = ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' }}</ref>
