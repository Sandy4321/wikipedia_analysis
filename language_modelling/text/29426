==Hermann G<U+00F6>ring==
Hofer was a Berlin art dealer who in 1937 became an art agent for Hermann G<U+00F6>ring. He agreed with G<U+00F6>ring that he could keep anything that he found that G<U+00F6>ring didn't want. With G<U+00F6>ring's money and backing, Hofer could access collections anywhere in Germany.<ref>[http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2002/summer/nazi-looted-art-1.html "Nazi Looted Art The Holocaust Records Preservation Project, Part 1."] Anne Rothfeld, ''Prologue Magazine'', Fall 2002, Vol. 34, No. 3.

After the end of the Second World War, Hofer was interrogated by the Allied forces and interned in Hersbruck. He was later [[Trial in absentia|convicted in absentia]] by a French military tribunal and sentenced to ten years in prison which he did not serve. He spent the rest of his life as an art dealer in Munich.
