'''Tate Liverpool''' is an [[art gallery]] and [[museum]] in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], and part of [[Tate]], along with [[Tate St Ives]], Cornwall,  [[Tate Britain]], London, and [[Tate Modern]], London. The museum was an initiative of the [[Merseyside Development Corporation]]. Tate Liverpool was created to display work from the [[Tate|Tate Collection]] which comprises the national collection of British art from the year 1500 to the present day, and  international modern art. The gallery also has a programme of temporary exhibitions. For a time it was the largest gallery of modern and [[contemporary art]] in the UK outside of London.

The gallery opened in [[1988]] and is housed in a converted warehouse within the [[Albert Dock]] on Liverpool's waterfront. The original conversion was done by [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] but the building was given a major refurbishment in 1998 to create additional gallery space.

In 2007, the foyer area was redesigned by architects Arca to create an updated appearance and better proportions, as well as to improve visitor handling. The centrepiece of the space is a new timber desk with an undulating orange fascia, which links to the retained colour scheme of the original conversion work by Stirling. A colour-changing wall acts as a backdrop to the simplified brick volume, visible from across Albert Dock. Behind the scenes, the architects also made alterations to the hospitality, cloakroom, events and education areas.
