'''{{Audio|Reykjavik sound.ogg|Reykjav<U+00ED>k}}''' ({{IPA2|<U+02C8>rei<U+02D0>ca<U+02CC>vi<U+02D0>k}}) is the [[capital]] of [[Iceland]], its largest [[city]], and [[the world's most northern]] national [[capital city|capital]] (its [[latitude]] being 64<U+00B0>08' N, not far from the [[Arctic Circle]]).  It receives only four hours of [[daylight]] per day in the depth of [[winter]], and during the [[summer]] the nights are almost as bright as the days. The city is the heart of the [[Greater Reykjav<U+00ED>k Area]]. Reykjav<U+00ED>k has continued to see population growth in past years. In December 2006 the population was 115,420 and the Great Reykjav<U+00ED>k Area was 191,030.

== Geography ==
Reykjav<U+00ED>k is located in southwest [[Iceland]] at the shores of  [[Faxafl<U+00F3>i]] bay. The Reykjav<U+00ED>k area coastline is characterized by peninsulas, coves, straits and islands.

During the [[Ice Age]] (until 10 000 years ago), a large glacier covered parts of the city area, reaching as far out as [[<U+00C1>lftanes]]. Other parts of the city area were covered by sea water. In the warm periods and at the end of the Ice Age, some hills like <U+00D6>skjuhl<U+00ED><U+00F0> were islands. The former sea-level is characterised by sediments (with clams) reaching f.ex. at <U+00D6>skjuhl<U+00ED><U+00F0> as far up as 43 m above current sea-level. The hills <U+00D6>skjuhl<U+00ED><U+00F0> and Sk<U+00F3>lav<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>uholt seem to be the remains of former [[shield volcanoes]] which were active during the warm periods of the Ice Age.

After the Ice Age, the land rose as the heavy load of the glaciers fell away, and began to look as it does today.  

But the capital city area was still shaped by [[earthquake]]s and [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], like the one 4500 years ago in the mountain range ''Bl<U+00E1>fj<U+00F6>ll'', when the lava coming down the Elli<U+00F0>a<U+00E1>rvalley reached the sea at the bay Elli<U+00F0>avogur. 

The largest river to run through Reykjav<U+00ED>k is the [[Elli<U+00F0>a<U+00E1>]] River, which is not navigable by ships, but one of the best [[salmon]] fishing rivers in the country. Mt. [[Esja]], at 914 m, is the tallest mountain in the vicinity of Reykjav<U+00ED>k.

The city of Reykjav<U+00ED>k is mostly located on the Seltjarnarnes peninsula, but the suburbs reach far out to the south and east from it. Reykjav<U+00ED>k is a spread out city; most of its urban area is in the form of low-density suburbs and houses are usually widely spaced. The outer residential neighborhoods are as well widely spaced from each other; in between them run the main traffic arteries and a lot of empty spaces with little aesthetic or recreational value. The young age of the city has contributed the most to this kind of urban planning.

===Climate===
Despite its extreme north Atlantic location, Reykjavik is not as cold as might be expected. The average mid-winter temperatures are no lower than those in [[Toronto]] or [[New York City]]. This is because the Icelandic coastal weather is moderated by the warm waters of the Gulf Stream. The city's coastal location does make it prone to wind, and gales are common in winter. Reykjavik is also a very wet city, having an average of 213 rainy days every year, with spring having slightly more sunny days.

== People ==
The population of Reykjav<U+00ED>k in December [[2006]] was 115,420, the combined population of the [[Greater Reykjav<U+00ED>k Area]] being about 191,030. There are six other municipalities in the capital city area, those are:
* [[<U+00C1>lftanes]]: 2,278
* [[Gar<U+00F0>ab<U+00E6>r]]: 9,529 
* [[Hafnarfj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>ur]]: 23,674 
* [[K<U+00F3>pavogur]]: 27,536 
* [[Mosfellsb<U+00E6>r]]: 7,303
* [[Seltjarnarnes]]: 4,467

An additional 823 persons were living in other places within the capital area.

== History ==
The first permanent settlement in Iceland by [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] people is believed to have been established in Reykjav<U+00ED>k by [[Ing<U+00F3>lfur Arnarson]] around AD [[870]]; this is described in ''[[Landn<U+00E1>mab<U+00F3>k]]'', or the Book of Settlement. Ing<U+00F3>lfur Arnarson is said to have decided the location of his settlement using a traditional viking method; by dumping his high seat pillars, [[<U+00D6>ndvegiss<U+00FA>lur]], in the ocean when he saw the coastline and then settled where the pillars came to shore.  Steam from hot springs in the region is supposed to have inspired Reykjav<U+00ED>k's name, as Reykjav<U+00ED>k translates to "Bay of Smokes".

Reykjav<U+00ED>k is not mentioned in any medieval sources except as a regular farm land but the [[18th century]] was the beginning of urban concentration there. The [[Denmark|Danish rulers]] of Iceland backed ideas of a domestic industry in Iceland that would help generate some much needed progress on the island. In [[1752]], the [[List of Danish monarchs|King of Denmark]] donated the estate of Reykjav<U+00ED>k to the [[Innr<U+00E9>ttingar Corporation]]; the name comes from [[Danish language|Danish]] "indretninger," meaning enterprise. The leading person in this movement was [[Sk<U+00FA>li Magn<U+00FA>sson]]. In the [[1750s]] several houses were constructed to house the [[wool]] industry that was to be Reykjav<U+00ED>k's most important employer for a few decades and the original reason for its existence. Other crafts were also practiced by the Innr<U+00E9>ttingar such as [[fishing|fisheries]], [[sulfur|sulphur mining]], [[agriculture]], and [[ship]] building.

[[image:Vikingship 07252003.jpg|thumb|left|300px|S<U+00F3>lfar, by [[Jon Gunnar Arnason]]]]

The Danish Crown abolished [[monopoly]] trading in [[1786]] and granted six communities around the country an exclusive trading charter, Reykjav<U+00ED>k was one of them and the only one to hold on to the charter permanently. 1786 is regarded as the date of the city's founding, celebrating its 200th anniversary in [[1986]]. Trading rights were still limited to the subjects of the Danish Crown however, and Danish traders continued to dominate trade in Iceland. Over the next decades, their business in Iceland expanded. After [[1880]], [[free trade]] was expanded to all [[nationality|nationalities]] and the influence of Icelandic merchants started to grow.
[[image:Hallgr<U+00ED>mskirkja.jpeg|200px|right|thumb|[[Hallgr<U+00ED>mskirkja]] in Reykjav<U+00ED>k]]
[[nationalism|Nationalist]] sentiment gained influence in the [[19th century]] and ideas about Icelandic independence became widespread. Reykjav<U+00ED>k, as Iceland's only city, was the melting pot of such ideas in the country. Advocates of an independent Iceland realized that a strong Reykjav<U+00ED>k was fundamental for that objective. All the important years in the history of the independence struggle are important for Reykjav<U+00ED>k as well. In the year [[1845]], [[Al<U+00FE>ingi]], or the general assembly that Icelanders formed in [[930]] was re-established in Reykjav<U+00ED>k, however it had been suspended a few decades earlier when it was located at [[<U+00DE>ingvellir]]. At the time it only functioned as an advisory assembly that was supposed to advise the King about the matters of Iceland. The placement of Al<U+00FE>ingi in Reykjav<U+00ED>k effectively established the city as the [[capital]] of Iceland. In [[1874]] Iceland was given a [[constitution]] and with it, Al<U+00FE>ingi gained some limited [[legislative]] powers and in essence became the institution that it is still today. The next step was to move most of the [[executive (government)|executive]] power to Iceland and that was done by the Home Rule in [[1904]] when the office of [[List of Prime Ministers of Iceland|minister for Iceland]] was established in Reykjav<U+00ED>k. The biggest step towards an independent Iceland was taken [[December 1]],[[1918]] when Iceland became a sovereign country under the [[List of Danish monarchs|Crown of Denmark]], the [[Kingdom of Iceland]].

In the [[1920s]] and [[1930s]] most of the growing Icelandic fishing trawler fleet sailed from Reykjav<U+00ED>k and salt-cod production was the main industry but the [[Great Depression]] hit Reykjav<U+00ED>k hard with unemployment and labour union struggles that sometimes became violent. 

In the morning of [[May 10]], [[1940]], following the German occupation of Denmark on [[April 9]], four warships approached Reykjav<U+00ED>k and anchored in the harbour. Many citizens were relieved to find out that those were [[United Kingdom|British]] rather than [[Germany|German]]. In a few hours, the [[Allies of World War II|allied]] occupation of Reykjav<U+00ED>k was complete. There was no armed resistance and taxi and truck drivers even assisted the invasion force which had no motor vehicles initially. The Icelandic government had received many requests from the British government about allowing the occupation but they always declined on the basis of the [[Neutral country|Neutrality Policy]]. For the remaining years of [[World War II]], British and later [[United States|American]] soldiers built bases in Reykjav<U+00ED>k; the number of foreign soldiers in Reykjav<U+00ED>k became about the same as the local population of the city. 

The economic effects of the occupation were quite positive for Reykjav<U+00ED>k: the unemployment of the depression years vanished and a lot of construction work was done. The British built Reykjav<U+00ED>k Airport, which is still in service today, mostly serving domestic flights; the Americans built [[Keflav<U+00ED>k]] Airport that has later become Iceland's primary international airport, situated 50 km from Reykjav<U+00ED>k. In [[1944]] the Republic of Iceland was founded and a [[List of Presidents of Iceland|president]] elected in popular elections replaced the King; the office of the president was placed in Reykjav<U+00ED>k.

In the post-war years, the growth of Reykjav<U+00ED>k accelerated. A mass exodus from the rural countryside began, largely due to improved technology in [[agriculture]] that reduced the need for workforce in that sector and because of the population boom following better living conditions in the country. Young people in the prime of their lives were the most populous group that moved to the capital to live the "Reykjav<U+00ED>k Dream", and the city became a city of children. A once primitive village was rapidly transforming into a modern city. Private cars became common and modern apartment complexes rose in the expanding suburbs.  Much of Reykjav<U+00ED>k lost its village feel. In [[1972]], Reykjav<U+00ED>k hosted the [[World Chess Championship 1972|world chess championship]] between [[Bobby Fischer]] and [[Boris Spassky]].

Reykjav<U+00ED>k has in the last two decades become a significant player in the global community.   The [[1986]] [[Reykjavik Summit]] between [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] underlined Reykjav<U+00ED>k's new-found international status. [[Deregulation]] in the financial sector and the computer revolution of the 1990s have transformed Reykjav<U+00ED>k yet again. The financial sector and [[information technology]] are now significant employers in the city. The city has fostered some world famous talents in recent years, such as the singer [[Bj<U+00F6>rk]] and the band [[Sigur R<U+00F3>s]].

== Administration ==
[[Image:R<U+00E1><U+00F0>h<U+00FA>s Reykjav<U+00ED>kur.jpg|thumb|300px|Reykjav<U+00ED>k City Hall]]

Reykjav<U+00ED>k is governed by the city council, directly elected by anyone aged over 18 and registered with domicile in the city. The council has 15 members that are elected for 4 year terms. The Independence Party had an overall control of the city council from the party's establishment in 1929 and until 1978 when they narrowly lost the election to NOC (no overall control). From 1978 to 1982 the People's Alliance, the Social Democratic Party and the Progressive Party formed the majority of the council. The Independence Party won an overall control in the 1982 elections, and held it until 1994. Then, its opponents had formed an alliance, called Reykjav<U+00ED>kurlistinn, or R-listinn. That alliance had an overall control until 2006. In the May 2006 elections the electorates could choose between five different Parties; three of them had former formed R-listinn. The Independence Party failed to gain an overall control (received 7 members of the council), but together with the Progressive Party, and its one council member, they were able to form a new majority in the council which took over in June 2006. 

The city council governs the city of Reykjav<U+00ED>k according to law number 45/1998 [http://www.althingi.is/lagas/128b/1998045.html]. The city council selects people on the boards and each board controls a different field under the city council's authority. The most important board is the city board that wields the executive rights along with the city mayor. The city mayor is the uppermost public official in the city and also the director of city operations. Other public official then control different institution under his authority.

Therefore the administration consists of two different parts. The political power that the city council wields and other boards in its authority and the official system where public official under the authority of the city mayor take care of administering the policy and the management.

The mayor is appointed by the city council, usually one of the council members is chosen but they may also hire a mayor that is not member of the council.

In the town-laws from [[1907]] the term ''city'' mayor public office was introduced but in the year [[1908]] applications for that position were requested. Two applications were received, one from [[P<U+00E1>ll Einarsson]] sheriff and town mayor of [[Hafnarfj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>ur]] and another one from [[Knud Zimsem]] town councillor in Reykjav<U+00ED>k. P<U+00E1>ll was employed on the 7th of May and was the city mayor for six years. The city mayor received, at that time, a salary of 4500IKR annually and 1500IKR because of office costs.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Roads ===
[[Automobile|Car]] ownership in Iceland is among the highest in the world, although Reykjav<U+00ED>k is not severely affected by [[congestion]] as the city is rather spread out. Wide multi-lane highways run all over the city connecting the different neighbourhoods and suburbs. Parking spaces are also plentiful in most areas. Public transportation only exists in the form of a bus system (called '[[Str<U+00E6>t<U+00F3> bs]]) and is not very popular in this car friendly city. [[Route 1 (Iceland)|Route 1]] (the Ring Road) runs by the city outskirts and connects it to the rest of Iceland.

=== Airports and seaports ===
[[Reykjav<U+00ED>k Airport]], the second largest [[airport]] in the country (after [[Keflav<U+00ED>k International Airport]]), is positioned inside the city, just south of the city centre. It is mainly used for domestic flights as well as flights to [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. It was built there by the [[United Kingdom|British]] occupation force during [[World War II]] on the outskirts of, then much smaller, Reykjav<U+00ED>k. In later years there has been some controversy regarding the location of the airport since it takes up a lot of valuable space in central Reykjav<U+00ED>k.

Reykjav<U+00ED>k has two [[seaport]]s, the old harbour near the city centre which is mainly used by [[Fisheries|fishermen]] and [[Cruise ship]]s and ''Sundah<U+00F6>fn'' in the east city which is the largest [[cargo]] port in the country.

===Heating===
Most houses in Reykjav<U+00ED>k use the [[geothermal heating]] system. It is the largest system of this kind in the world. See [[geothermal power in Iceland]].

==Nightlife==
<!-- this should probably be re-modelled into a "Culture and lifestyle" section -->
[[Image:Sirkus,Bar,Reykjav<U+00ED>k,Iceland.jpg|thumb|left|Sirkus Bar, Reykjavik]]
'''Reykjav<U+00ED>k''' is often dubbed "the nightlife capital of the north" [http://www.infoiceland.is/infoiceland/nightlife/reykjavik_nightlife/nightclubs_in_reykjavik/].  It is famous for its [[nightlife]] during the weekends.  Icelanders tend to go out late so [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s that look rather quiet can fill up suddenly, usually around midnight on a [[weekend]].

One of the main causes for this is that [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] is very expensive at bars, so people tend to drink at home before going out.  [[Beer]] was [[Prohibition|banned]] in Iceland until [[1 March]] [[1989]], but has since become Icelanders' drink of choice {{fact}}.  However, like other alcoholic beverages, it is still quite expensive; a [[pint]] (actually a half [[litre]]) of beer in an Icelandic bar can cost between 350 and 800 [[Icelandic Kr<U+00F3>na|kr<U+00F3>nur]], or from 4 to 9 [[euro]]. To this end, some people show up late and are already [[Drunkenness|drunk]] when they arrive at the bars downtown.

There are over 100 different bars and clubs in Reykjav<U+00ED>k; most of them are located on [[Laugavegur (Reykjav<U+00ED>k)|Laugavegur]] and its side streets. It is very common for an establishment that is a [[caf<U+00E9>]] before dinner to turn into a bar in the evening.  Closing time is usually around 3-7AM on weekends and 1-3AM during the week.

==New Year's Eve==
The arrival of the new year is a particular cause of celebration to the people of Reykjav<U+00ED>k. Icelandic law states that any adult may purchase and use fireworks during a certain period around New years.  They spend enormous sums of money on fireworks, most of which are fired as midnight approaches on [[December 31]].  As a result, every year the city is lit up with what may very well be the biggest [[fireworks]] display in the world.  Some celebrities visit Reykjav<U+00ED>k during the New Year solely in order to view the spectacle and enjoy the vibrant nightlife that follows.
