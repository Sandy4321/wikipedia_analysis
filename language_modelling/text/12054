He was introduced early in 2005 and stayed until the show ended in mid 2006.
Alex was originally Leading Senior Constable but became Acting Sergeant towards the end of 2005.
When Alex arrived in [[Mount Thomas]], he fell for [[Susie Raynor]] and the two had a brief fling.  However, when he realised that his old mate Jonsey was interested in Susie, he decided to back off.  However, Susie officially broke up with Alex when she realised they were never going to become a serious relationship.  Susie and Jonsey later had a brief relationship and Alex tried to help their relationship get along.
