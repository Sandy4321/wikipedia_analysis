The '''Philippine National Railways''' ({{lang-fil|Pambansang Daangbakal ng Pilipinas}}), commonly abbreviated as '''PNR''', is a [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned]] [[railway company|railway operator]] in the Philippines, operating an extensive railway line on the island of [[Luzon]]. As of 2010, it operates two [[commuter rail]] services in [[Metro Manila]] and the [[Bicol Region]]. The commuter line in Metro Manila is part of the [[Strong Republic Transit System]] and is referred to as the Orange Line.

PNR began operations on June 26, 1875 as the ''Ferrocaril de Manila-Dagupan'', during the Spanish colonial period, and later becoming the ''Manila Railroad Company'' (MRR) during the American colonial period. It became the Philippine National Railways on June 20, 1946 by virtue of Republic Act No. 4156. The PNR is an attached agency under the [[Department of Transportation and Communications]].

PNR used to operate over {{convert|479|km|mi|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} of route from [[La Union]] up to [[Bicol Region|Bicol]]. However, continued neglect in past decades reduced PNR's efficiency and railroad coverage. Persistent problems with informal settlers in the 1990s contributed further to PNR's decline. In 2006, Typhoons [[Typhoon Xangsane|Milenyo]] and [[Typhoon Durian|Reming]] caused severe damage to the network, resulting in the suspension of the Manila-Bicol services.

In 2007 the Philippine government initiated a rehabilitation project aiming to remove informal settlers from the PNR right-of-way, revitalize commuter services in Metro Manila, and restore the Manila-Bicol route as well as lost services in Northern Luzon. In July 2009, PNR unveiled a new corporate identity and inaugurated new [[rolling stock]].

==History==
On June 25, 1875, under a royal decree issued by [[King of Spain|King]] [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]] of Spain, the required Inspector of Public Works of the Philippine Islands was requested to submit a railway system plan for [[Luzon]]. The plan, which was submitted five months later by Don Eduardo Lopez Navarro, was entitled ''Memoria Sobre el Plan General de Ferrocarriles en la Isla de Luz<U+00F3>n'', and was promptly approved. A concession for the construction of a railway line from [[Manila]] to [[Dagupan City|Dagupan]] was granted to Don Edmundo Sykes of the ''Ferrocarril de Manila-Dagupan'' on June 1, 1887.<ref name="northrail-history" />

The ''Ferrocarril de Manila-Dagupan'' which constitutes much of the North Main Line today, began construction in July 1887 with the laying of the cornerstone for [[Tutuban railway station|Tutuban station]]. The railway was 195 kilometers long at the time of its opening on November 24, 1892, running from Manila to Dagupan City in [[Pangasinan]].

[[File:PNR Logo.png|250px|left|thumb|The old Philippine National Railways logo, which had been in use since the 1960s.]]
Later the Ferrocarril de Manila-Dagupan became the Manila Railway Company.<ref name="northrail-history">{{cite web |url=http://www.pnr.gov.ph/history.htm |title=Brief history of PNR |publisher=Philippine National Railways |accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref>
It was nationalized and its assets were acquired by the Philippine government, which expanded the rail network, only to have most of those improvements lost during World War II.<ref name="northrail-history" />  Of the 1,140 route-kilometers before the war, only 452 route-kilometers were operational after it.<ref name="northrail-history" /> The extensive damage to the system took several years to repair. During the 1950s the Manila Rail Company fleet of trains was converted from steam to [[diesel engine]]s. The Manila Rail Company was given a new charter under [[List of Philippine laws|Republic Act No. 4156]], and the company changed its name to Philippine National Railways.

Natural calamities such as the 1973 and 1975 floods disrupted services and forced the closure of several parts of the main lines. On July 23, 1979, President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] issued Executive Order No. 546, which designated the Philippine National Railways as an attached agency of the [[Department of Transportation and Communications (Philippines)|Department of Transportation and Communications]].<ref name="northrail-history" /> During the administration of [[Corazon Aquino]], the North Main Line was closed, with trains unable to reach various [[provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] in the country. The current administration of [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] is actively pursuing the rehabilitation of the Philippine National Railways through various investments and projects designed to revive Philippine rail transport,<ref name="northrail-history" /><ref name="southrail" /><ref name="pnr-rehab">{{cite news |title=PNR rail rehabilitation to start September  |first=Riza T. |last=Olchondra |url=http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view_article.php?article_id=61814 |newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |location=Manila |date=April 22, 2007 |accessdate=April 28, 2010 |quote=The Philippine National Railways (PNR) will start repairing and improving its North and South railways by September, PNR General Manager Jose Ma. Sarasola II said Friday. }}</ref><ref name="PNR Facts" /> despite the numerous problems involved. Total reconstruction of rail bridges and tracks, including replacement of the current 35-kilogram track with newer 50-kilogram tracks<ref name="pnr-rehab" /> and the refurbishing of stations, were part of the rehabilitation and expansion process. The first phase, converting all the lines of the [[Metro Manila|Manila metropolitan area]], were completed in 2009.<ref name="pnr-rehab" /> On July 14, 2009, [[President of the Philippines|Philippine President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] presided over the launch of the new [[diesel multiple-unit]]s of the Philippine National Railways. As part of its new image, a new brand name, ''PNR Filtrack'' was added. In the second phase of rehabilitation, a 112.23 kilometres of line would be constructed in the southern [[provinces of the Philippines]] at a cost of [[Dollar|$]]304.23&nbsp;million.<ref name="bicol-commuter" />

==Rolling stock==

Four types of [[rolling stock]] run on PNR's lines: the [[locomotive]]s, the Commex express cars, [[baggage car]]s and [[DRC railcar]]s.<ref name="PNR profile" /> All services were operated by [[General Electric]] locomotives and DMUs. There were 14 locomotives, 18 Commex express cars, 2 [[baggage car]]s and 8 [[DRC railcar]]s currently operating.<ref name="PNR profile">{{cite web |url=http://www.pnr.gov.ph/profile.htm |title=PNR Company Profile |publisher=Philippine National Railways |accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref>

==Operations and services==
The PNR currently operates in the [[Metro Manila|Manila metropolitan area]] and the [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] of [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Quezon]], [[Camarines Sur]] and [[Albay]].  In the past, the PNR also used to serve the provinces of [[Bulacan]], [[Pampanga]], [[Tarlac]], [[Nueva Ecija]], [[Pangasinan]] and [[La Union]] on the North Main Line, and [[Batangas]] on the South Main Line.

The North Main Line will be partly replaced under the current Northrail project.

In line with the railway's rehabilitation, there are plans to revive previously discontinued services.

===Passenger services===
[[File:PNR Tayuman 2009 MC.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Previously, ''Commex'' runs were performed exclusively by PNR locomotives.]]
[[File:PNR Sucat train.jpg|thumb|right|250px|At present, [[Hyundai Rotem]] DMUs are the primary trains used on ''Commex'' runs.]]
[[File:PNR GE locomotives with JR series 12.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A PNR train, GE locomotives with JR series 12 passenger cars, at Tutuban Station, which is likely suspended.]]

====Commuter Express====
The ''Commuter Express'' (also ''Metro Commuter''),<ref name="metrocommuter">{{cite web |url=http://www.pnr.gov.ph/commuter.htm | title=Metro Commuter |publisher=Philippine National Railways |accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> commonly called the ''Commex'', serves as the [[commuter rail]] service for the [[Metro Manila|Manila metropolitan area]], extending as far south as [[Calamba City]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]].  The PNR uses GE locomotives hauling Commex passenger cars, as well as newly-procured [[Hyundai Rotem]] DMUs, for this service.

''Commex'' service using the new DMUs is currently offered between [[Tutuban railway station|Tutuban]] and [[Alabang railway station|Alabang]] in [[Muntinlupa City]], while a daily ''Commex'' run between Manila and [[Bi<U+00F1>an City]], Laguna runs using GE locomotives.  Currently, ''Commex'' trains make 19 daily in each direction.<ref name="sucat">{{cite news |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/245408/pnr-aircon-train |title=PNR aircon trains set to reach Sucat |first=J.C. |last=Bello Ruz |date=February 27, 2010 |newspaper=[[Manila Bulletin]] |accessdate=April 29, 2010 |quote=The new air-conditioned commuter trains of the rehabilitated Philippine National Railways (PNR) will operate up to Sucat, Para<U+00F1>aque starting Monday.}}</ref>

====Bicol Commuter====
The ''Bicol Commuter'' service serves as the [[commuter rail]] backbone of the Bicol Region, serving stations between [[Tagkawayan, Quezon|Tagkawayan]], [[Quezon]] and [[Ligao City]], [[Albay]], with Naga City in [[Camarines Sur]] acting as a central terminus.  The service was launched on September 16, 2009, in time for the feast of [[Our Lady of Pe<U+00F1>afrancia]].<ref name="bicol-commuter">{{cite news |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090918-225735/Bicol-train-chugs-to-a-halt-in-test-run |title=Bicol train chugs to a halt in test run |first1=Juan |last1=Escandor Jr. |first2 = Pons | last2 = Caudilla |date=September 18, 2009 |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |location= Manila |accessdate=April 29, 2010 |quote=The spirit was willing, but the diesel-fed old engines were not. }}</ref>

''Bicol Commuter'' trains make seven trips a day, alternating between Tagkawayan, [[Sipocot, Camarines Sur|Sipocot]], Naga and Ligao as termini.  Five trips run using a ''Commuter Express'' DMU sent to the Bicol Region, while two trips use GE locomotives.

===Defunct services===
====Intercity services====
Currently, the PNR does not provide any intercity service.  It did however have three trains plying stations between Manila and southern Luzon before all intercity service was cut in 2006 as a consequence of the extensive damage to infrastructure by [[Typhoon Xangsane]] (Milenyo): the ''Mayon Limited'', the ''Pe<U+00F1>afrancia Express'' (previously the ''Prestige'') and the ''Bicol Express''.  Before service was cut in the 1970s and 1980s, the PNR likewise served stations north of Manila through several trains, most notably the ''Ilocos Special'' and the ''Dagupan Express''.

=====Mayon Limited=====
The '''Mayon Limited''' was hauled alternatively by French [[Alsthom]] [[locomotive]]s and General Electric locomotives,<ref name="PNR Facts" /> and ran northward from '''Legaspi railway station''' up the steep gradient leading to '''Camalig railway station''' in the foothills of the [[Mayon Volcano]] with another locomotive pushing from the rear. The Manila-Legaspi route was also served by the Mayon Limited service, using the Mayon Limited Special (Train T-577), the fastest train operating on the South Main Line.

=====Prestige and Pe<U+00F1>afrancia Express=====
The '''Prestige''' used Japanese-built self-propelled coaches and was the only [[train]] not to be hauled by General Electric locomotives.<ref name="PNR Facts">{{cite web |url=http://www.fact-index.com/p/ph/philippine_national_railways.html |title=Philippine National Railways |publisher=Fact-index |accessdate=May 3, 2010 }}</ref> It was frequently the first of the three express trains to arrive. With priority over all other trains on its route, and calling only at [[Daraga, Albay|Daraga]], [[Ligao City|Ligao]], [[Naga City, Camarines Sur|Naga]], [[Lucena City|Lucena]], and [[Paco, Manila|Paco]], it normally arrived in '''Tutuban railway station''', Manila's Grand Central, making it a popular service with businessmen. The 48-seater air-conditioned coaches of the Prestige were somewhat narrower and lower than those built in Madras, which also contributed to the faster run.<ref name="PNR Facts" />

The '''Pe<U+00F1>afrancia Express''', a similar service which serves as the replacement for the Prestige service, runs the same self-propelled Japanese coaches. The Pe<U+00F1>afrancia Express calls at Naga, [[Lopez, Quezon|Lopez]], [[Pagbilao, Quezon|Pagbilao]], [[San Pablo City]] and [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampaloc]]. The Pe<U+00F1>afrancia service runs at a lower speed than the Prestige did.

=====Express services=====

The PNR also operates several express services. Some of these services were discontinued for financial reasons. The first express service for [[Luzon]] was the Baguio Express, which operates from [[Manila]] via [[San Fabian]], [[Pangasinan]] to Camp One, where the motor vehicles, namely the Stanley and De Dion steamers, of the Benguet Auto Line transport passengers proceeding to Baguio. Another express service was the Ilocos Express, which lasted until the 1980s. This began operating in 1930 and had a dining car with catering provided by the [[Manila Hotel]]. Following the modernization program of the Manila Railway Company in 1955, the Ilocos Express featured a 7A class "De Luxe" coach until 1979, when the lack of operable air-conditioned coaches caused a switch to a "Tourist"-class coach. The company also operated the Paniqui Express in the 1930s, but that was eclipsed by the Ilocos Express.

The fastest train operated by the PNR on the North Main Line was the Ilocos Special (Train 26) during the 1970s. This [[diesel multiple-unit|DMU]] train took four hours to run the 195 kilometres between Manila and [[Dagupan City|Dagupan]]. In addition to these express trains, the PNR introduced the Amianan Day Express (Train 74) in February 1974 and the Amianan Night Express (Train 72), the last train to depart Manila for any destination on both lines. The Amianan Night Express runs faster than its day counterpart, the Amianan Day Express, making the 260-kilometre run to [[San Fernando City, La Union|San Fernando City]], La Union in five  hours. Another express service was the Bicol Express, which has operated since 1938. Like the Amianan express service, the Bicol Express has two express services: the Bicol Day Express (Train No. T-511) and the Bicol Night Express (Train No. T-515). The Isarog Express, operating from Manila to [[Naga City]], also has two express services, the Isarog  Day Express (Train T-521) and the Isarog Night Express (Train T-519).

The PNR used to offer freight services, using General Electric U15C 900-series locomotives bought by the company in 1974. There was also a limited mobile hospital service. There have been suggestions that these freight services might return, along with the Bicol line.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Stations==
[[Image:PNR Buendia 2010 MC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Buendia railway station in [[Makati City]]. The station was rehabilitated as part of Phase 1 of the Northrail-Southrail Linkage Project which began in 2007.]]
[[File:PNR Pasay Road.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The newly refurbished [[Pasay Road railway station]].]]

The Philippine National Railways operate two different rail lines, namely the North Main Line (Green Line) and the South Main Line (Orange Line), along with the three spur lines, which serve various parts of [[Luzon]] with its currently [[List of Philippine National Railways stations|127 active stations]]. The only operating line, the South Main Line (Orange Line), serves as the [[regional rail]] backbone of Southern Luzon.

===Station layout===

All PNR stations are [[at-grade intersection|at-grade]], using a [[side platform]] layout. Most have only basic amenities: platforms and ticket booths. Rehabilitated stations along the Metro Manila line have been fitted with ramps for wheelchair-bound passengers. Several stations have extended platforms, having an upper platform catering to DMU services, and a lower platform for regular locomotive-hauled services.

The Northrail project involves the upgrading of the present-day single track to an elevated dual-track system, converting the [[rail gauge]] from [[narrow gauge]] to [[standard gauge]], linking Manila to [[Malolos City]] in [[Bulacan]] and further on to [[Angeles City]] and the [[Clark Special Economic Zone]], as well as [[Diosdado Macapagal International Airport]].  This project is estimated to cost around US$500&nbsp;million, with China providing some US$400&nbsp;million in concessionary financing, as much of the right-of-way on Northrail will be brand new.<ref name="northrail-cost">{{cite news | url = http://www.lrta.gov.ph/news/news_item_040604_RpChinaBreakGroundForManila-IlocosRailway.htm | title = RP, China break ground  for Manila-Ilocos railway | newspaper = [[Malaya (newspaper)|Malaya]] | date = April 6, 2004 }}</ref>  Construction began in early November 2006.<ref name="northrail-start">{{cite news | url = http://news.inq7.net/archive_article/index.php?ver=1&index=1&story_id=30916 | title = De Castro bats for hiring of squatters for NorthRail project | newspaper =  Philippine Daily Inquirer | location = Manila | date =  November 6, 2006 }}</ref> and was expected to have been operational in 2010. Due to delays in the construction work, it is currently being renegotiated with the Chinese government.
