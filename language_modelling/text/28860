'''Transnistria''', also known as '''Trans-Dniestr''' or '''Transdniestria''' is a [[List of active separatist movements in Europe#<U+00A0>Moldova|breakaway territory]] located mostly on a strip of land between the [[Dniester River]] and the eastern Moldovan border to [[Ukraine]]. Since its [[declaration of independence]] in 1990, and especially after the [[War of Transnistria]] in 1992, it is governed ''[[de facto]]'' as the [[List of states with limited recognition|unrecognized]] '''Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic''' (PMR, also known as "Pridnestrovie"), which claims the territory to the east of the river [[Dniester]] as well as the city of [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] and its surrounding localities located on the west bank. The modern [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]] does not recognize the secession and considers territories controlled by the PMR to be part of Moldova's [[autonomous region]] of '''St<U+00EE>nga Nistrului''' (''"Left Bank of the Dniester"'').<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/print_2051.html CIA World factbook Moldova. territorial unit: Stinga Nistrului (Transnistria)]</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Herd|first= Graeme P.|coauthors= Jennifer D.

After the [[dissolution of the USSR]], tensions between the Moldovan government and the breakaway unrecognized state's authorities in [[Tiraspol]] escalated into a [[War of Transnistria|military conflict]] that started in March 1992 and was concluded by a [[ceasefire]] in July 1992. As part of that agreement, a three-party (Russia, Moldova, Transnistria) [[Joint Control Commission]] supervises the security arrangements in the [[demilitarized zone]], comprising 20 localities on both sides of the river. Although the ceasefire has held, the territory's political status remains unresolved: commonly considered ''[[De jure]]'' part of Moldova, Transnistria is a ''[[de facto]]'' [[Independence|independent]] state.<ref>Jos Boonstra, Senior Researcher, Democratisation Programme, FRIDE.

{{Main|Names for Transnistria}}
It is known in English as '''Transnistria''' (which is also the name of the region in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]), '''Trans-Dniestr'''<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/3641826.stm Regions and territories: Trans-Dniester], [[BBC News]], 2007-03-07</ref> or '''Transdniestria'''.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9116439 The black hole that ate Moldova: A glimpse inside Transdniestria], [http://www.economist.com/ Economist], 3 May 2007</ref> Etymologically, these names come down to similar spelling variants of Transnistria, meaning "beyond the river [[Dniester]]".

The documents of the government of [[Moldova]] refer to the region as '''St<U+00EE>nga Nistrului''' (Unit<U+0103><U+0163>ile Administrativ-Teritoriale din St<U+00EE>nga Nistrului), which means "'''Left Bank of the Dniester'''" ("Administrative-territorial unit(s) of the Left Bank of the Dniester"). Colloquially it is called "Transnistria".

==History==
 {{Main|History of Transnistria}}

===Antiquity and Middle Ages===
The area where Transnistria is now located has been inhabited by Indo-European tribes for millennia, being a borderland between [[Dacia]] and [[Scythia]]. The [[Tyragetae]] (a [[Getae]] [[Thracian]] tribe) inhabited the area around the Dnestr river (called "Tyras" in ancient documents), as well as the [[Scythians]].
Early Germanic and Mongolic tribes were present in the area during their invasions of the [[Roman Empire]].

Migrating from the North, [[Slavs]] were present on the shores of the Dnestr river from the second half of the 6th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} In the early [[Middle Ages]], [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes of [[Tivertsi]] and [[Ulichs]]<ref>The [[Laurentian Codex]] of the [[Primary Chronicle]] ([http://litopys.org.ua/]) contains the following lines (translated): ''Ulichi, Tivertsy lived along the Dniester; a lot of them settled on the Danube; settled along the Dniester down to the sea, their cities can be found unto this day.''</ref> populated larger areas, including Transnistria, followed by [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] nomads such as the [[Petchenegs]]<ref>Porphyrogenitus, Constantine. [http://faculty.washington.edu/dwaugh/rus/texts/constp.html De Administrando Imperio] ca. 950. Retrieved 2006-12-27.</ref> and [[Cumans]]. Possibly an early part of [[Kievan Rus']], after the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] in 1241, the territory was briefly under Mongol control (yet probably without any permanent settlements), and later under the [[Crimean Khanate]].

===Early modern period===
[[File:Avsuvorov.jpg|thumb|upright|The statue of [[Alexander Suvorov]], founder of modern Tiraspol.]]
From the 15th century, northern Transnistria (current districts of [[Camenca]] and [[R<U+00EE>bni<U+0163>a]]) belonged to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]],<ref>George Reichersdorf: ''Moldavi<U+00E6> qu<U+00E6> olim Daci<U+00E6> pers, chorographia, Georgio a Reichersdorf Transilvano auctore'', Vienn<U+00E6> 1541.</ref><ref>Bronovius and Georg Werner: "''Transylvania, Moldavia and Chersonesus Tauric<U+00E6>'". Published by Arnold Mylius, Cologne, 1595.</ref><ref>Antonio Bonfini (1434 - 1503): ''Rerum Ungaricarum decades quatuor cum dimidia''</ref><ref>Giovanni Botero (1540-1617): ''Relazioni universali'', Venice, 1591</ref><ref>Giovanni Antonio Magini (1555-1617): ''Geographie universae'', Venice, 1596.</ref> and later to the [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth|Kingdom of Poland]] (1569<U+2013>1793), which encouraged the migration of peasants into the territory from the neighboring populated areas (from north and from west). Prince of [[Moldavia]] [[Gheorghe Duca]] (1665<U+2013>66, 1668<U+2013>72, 1678<U+2013>84) built a court at [[<U+0162>icanova]] on the east bank of the [[Dniester]], and one at [[Nimirov]] on the [[Southern Bug]], last mentioned in Moldavian hands in 1765.<ref>N. Iorga, ''Rom<U+00E2>nii de peste Nistru'', "Basarabia", nr. 11/1992, page 87</ref><ref>Viorel Dolha, "Totul despre Transnistria", http://www.aiarad.ro/forum/viewtopic.php?t=39</ref> The localities [[Dub<U+0103>sari]], Ra<U+015F>cov, [[Vasilc<U+0103>u]], as well as four other currently in Ukraine are mentioned in 17th-18th centuries as fairs for the Dniester-Bug region. In 1769 a document dated at [[Bendery]] mentions the then title of the Mitropolitan of [[Moldavia]] as ''Mitropolitan of [[Br<U+0103>ila|Proilavia]], of [[Reni|Tamarova]], of [[Khotin|Hotin]], and of all the borders of the Danube, of the Dniester, and the Han's Ukraine'',<ref>E.<U+015E>t. Holban, ''Figuri basarabene'', "Basarabia", nr.1/1992</ref> the latter being a common reference to the then sparsely populated [[Dniester]]-[[Southern Bug]]-[[Dniepr]] area.

Before becoming part of the [[Russian Empire]] in 1792 (southern part) and 1793 (northern part), the largest groups living between the Dniester and the Bug rivers were Moldavian (Romanian), Ruthenian (Ukrainian), and Tatar peasants.<ref>Andrew Wilson: "The Ukrainians: Engaging the Eastern Diaspora" (Westview Press, 1998)</ref> The Russian census of 1793 of the Ochakov region (southern part of the Dniester-Bug area) mentions a totality of 67 villages, of which 49 are mentioned as Moldavian and 18 as Tatar.<ref>E. Lozovan, ''Rom<U+00E2>nii orientali de la Nistru la Vladivostok'', "Neamul Rom<U+00E2>nesc", nr.1/1991, page 32</ref> The first candidate for the governor of the new Russian region was the Moldavian boyar Alexandru I.

In 1792, the region became part of the Russian Empire as a result of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787-1792)|sixth Russo-Turkish War]]. In that year, the general [[Alexander Suvorov]] founded modern Tiraspol as a Russian border fortress.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20071015233743/http://worldwindow.md/trans_en.html About Transdnistrea] World Window NGO. Retrieved 2006-12-27.</ref> Until the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the current Transnistria was divided between the imperial [[guberniya]]s of [[Podolia]], [[Kherson]], and [[Bessarabia]]. Most of the territory which now is Transnistria was part of the larger [[Novorossiya|New Russia]] region,<ref>The Politics of State Building: Centre-Periphery Relations in Post-Soviet Ukraine, Roman Solchanyk, Europe-Asia Studies, Vol. 46, No. 1 (1994), pp. 47-68</ref> hence it saw a strong colonization process, with a multitude of ethnicities being settled: lands were given to [[Russian serfdom|enserfed]] peasantry from Russia and Ukraine (see also [[Nova Serbia]]), and Jews and [[Germans]] were brought to facilitate economic development.

===Soviet Union===
{{Main|Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavian SSR}}
Transnistria became an autonomous political entity in 1924 with the proclamation of the [[Moldavian ASSR]], which included today's Transnistria (4,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) as well as an adjacent area (9,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) around the city of [[Balta, Ukraine|Balta]] in modern-day [[Ukraine]], but nothing from Bessarabia, which at the time was part of [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]. One of the reasons for the creation of the [[Moldavian ASSR]] was the desire of the [[Soviet Union]] at the time to eventually incorporate [[Bessarabia]]. The Moldavian SSR, which was organised by a decision of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] on 2 August 1940, was formed from a part of Bessarabia ([[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum|taken from Romania]] on 28 June, after the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop pact]]), and a part of the Moldavian ASSR which is roughly equivalent to present-day Transnistria.

In 1941, after [[Axis powers|Axis forces]] invaded the Soviet Union during the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Second World War]], they defeated the Soviet troops in the region and [[Transnistria (World War II)|occupied it]]. By March 1943, a total of 185,000 Ukrainian and Romanian Jews had been deported and the majority were [[Einsatzgruppen|murdered]] or died from other causes in ghettos and concentration camps in an area immediately north and east of the current Transnistria, which as the latter was under Romanian and partly German occupation.

[[File:Igor Smirnov.jpg|thumb|[[Igor Smirnov]]]]
In the 1980s, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]] in the [[Soviet Union]] allowed political liberalization at a regional level. This led to the creation of various informal movements in the [[Moldavian SSR]], and the resurgence of pro-Romanian nationalism among ethnic Moldovans.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1113586.stm Timeline: Moldova] BBC Country Profile: Moldova</ref> The most prominent of these movements was the [[Popular Front of Moldova]]. Since the spring of 1988, PFM demanded from the Soviet authorities to declare [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]] the only state language, to return to the use of the Latin alphabet and to recognize the shared ethnic identity of Moldovans and Romanians. The more radical factions of the Popular Front used extremely anti-minority, ethnocentric and chauvinist rhetoric.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=hEFJ0sGr6e8C Chechnya: Tombstone of Russian Power], Anatol Lieven, Yale University Press, 1999, ISBN 0300078811, pp 246</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=NNWHtqBJcGwC Can Liberal Pluralism Be Exported?], Will Kymlicka, Magdalena Opalski, Oxford University Press, 2001, ISBN 0199240639, pp 208</ref> Some have called for minority populations, particularly the Slavs (mainly Russians and Ukrainians) and [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]], to leave or be expelled from Moldova.<ref>[http://www.anthrobase.com/Txt/D/Demirdirek_H_01.htm The painful past retold Social memory in Azerbaijan and Gagauzia], H<U+00FC>lya Demirdirek, Postkommunismens Antropologi, University of Copenhagen, 12<U+2013>14 April 1996</ref>

On 31 August 1989, the Supreme Soviet of the Moldavian SSR adopted Moldovan as the only official language, with Russian retained only for secondary purposes, returned Moldovan to the Latin alphabet, and declared a shared Moldova-Romanian linguistic identity. As plans for major cultural changes in Moldova were made public, tensions rose further. Ethnic minorities felt threatened by the prospects of removing Russian as the de facto official language, the possible future reunification of Moldova and Romania and the ethnocentric rhetoric of the Popular Front. The Yedinstvo (Unity) Movement, established by the Slavic population of Moldova, pressed for the equal status given to both Russian and Moldovan.<ref>Andrei Panici.

On 2 September 1990, the [[Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was proclaimed as a Soviet republic by an [[ad hoc]] assembly, the Second Congress of the Peoples' Representatives of Transnistria. The situation in the country began to escalate into violence, when in October 1990 the Popular Front called for volunteers to form armed militias to stop a Gagauz autonomy referendum by coercion. In response, volunteer militias were formed in Transnistria. In April 1990, nationalist mobs attacked ethnic Russian members of parliament, while the Moldovan police refused to intervene or restore order.<ref name="Kaufman143">[http://books.google.com/books?id=2Plw98pTk5wC&pg=PA143 Modern Hatreds: The Symbolic Politics of Ethnic War], Stuart J.

Citing the restriction of civil rights of ethnic minorities by Moldova as the cause of the dispute, in the interest of preserving a unified Moldavian SSR within the USSR and preventing the situation escalating further into violence the then [[President of the Soviet Union|Soviet President]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] declared the Transnistria proclamation to be lacking legal basis and annulled it by presidential decree on 22 December 1990.<ref>;Kolsto, et al.

=== War of Transnistria ===
The [[War of Transnistria]] followed armed clashes on a limited scale which broke out between Transnistrian separatists and Moldova as early as November 1990 at [[Dub<U+0103>sari]].

===  Further negotiations ===
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev 18 March 2009-2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Igor Smirnov]] with [[Vladimir Voronin]] and [[Dmitry Medvedev]] in Barvikha on 18 March 2009.]]
The OSCE is trying to facilitate a negotiated settlement. Under OSCE auspices, on 8 May 1997, the Moldovan President [[Petru Lucinschi]] and the Transnistrian president [[Igor Smirnov]], signed the "Memorandum on the principles of normalizations of the relations between the Republic of Moldova and Transnistria", also known as the "Primakov Memorandum", sustaining the establishment of legal and state relations, although the memorandum's provisions had diverging legal and political interpretations in [[Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u]] and [[Tiraspol]].

In November 2003, [[Dmitry Kozak]], a counselor of the Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]], proposed a memorandum on the creation of an [[Asymmetric federalism|asymmetric]] federal Moldovan state, with Moldova holding a majority and Transnistria being a minority part of the federation.<ref>[http://www.acus.org/publication/moldova-matters-why-progress-still-possible-ukraines-southwestern-flank Moldova Matters: Why Progress is Still Possible on Ukraine's Southwestern Flank], Pamela Hyde Smith, The Atlantic Council of the United States, March 2005</ref> Known as "the [[Kozak memorandum]]", it did not coincide with the Transnistrian position, which sought equal status between Transnistria and Moldova, but was giving Transnistria veto powers over future constitutional changes, which hence agreed to sign it. [[Vladimir Voronin]] was initially supportive of the plan, but refused to sign it after internal opposition and international pressure from the OSCE and US, and after Russia had endorsed the Transnistrian demand to maintain a Russian military presence for the next 20 years as a guarantee for the intended federation.<ref>[http://www.clingendael.nl/publications/2004/20041200_cstp_art_l%F6wenhardt.pdf Netherlands Institute of International Relations - The OSCE Moldova and Russian diplomacy 2003] page - 109</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|List of places in Transnistria}}
{{See also|Disputed status of Transnistria#Border issues|l1=Disputed status of Transnistria: Border issues}}
Transnistria is [[landlocked]] and borders [[Bessarabia]] (i.e. the rest of Moldova, for 411&nbsp;km) to the West, and [[Ukraine]] (for 405&nbsp;km) to the East. It is a narrow valley stretching in the North-South direction along the bank of the [[Dniester River]], which forms a natural boundary along most of the border with (the rest of) Moldova. Tiraspol, the capital and largest city of Transnistria, has about 160,000 inhabitants.

The territory controlled by the PMR is mostly, but not completely, coincident with the left (eastern) bank of [[Dniester]]. It includes ten cities and towns, and 69 communes, with a totality of 147 localities (counting the unincorporated ones as well). Six communes on the left bank ([[Cocieri]], [[Molovata Nou<U+0103>]], [[Corjova, Dub<U+0103>sari|Corjova]], [[P<U+00EE>r<U+00EE>ta]], [[Co<U+015F>ni<U+0163>a]], and [[Doro<U+0163>caia]]) remained under the control of the Moldovan government after the [[War of Transnistria]] in 1992, as part of the [[Dub<U+0103>sari district]]. They are situated north and south of the city of [[Dub<U+0103>sari]], which itself is under PMR  control. The village of Roghi of Molovata Nou<U+0103> Commune is also controlled by Tiraspol (Moldova controls the other nine of the ten villages of the six communes).

On the west bank, the city of [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] and four communes (containing a total of six villages) to its east, south-east, and south, on the opposite bank of the river [[Dniester]] from the city of [[Tiraspol]] ([[Proteagailovca]], [[G<U+00EE>sca]], [[Chi<U+0163>cani, Moldova|Chi<U+0163>cani]], and [[Cremenciug, C<U+0103>u<U+015F>eni|Cremenciug]]) are controlled by Transnistrian authorities.

The localities controlled by the Moldovan authorities on the eastern bank, the village of [[Roghi]], and the city of Dub<U+0103>sari (situated on the eastern bank and controlled by Tiraspol), the six villages and one city controlled by the Transnistrian authorities on the western bank, as well as two ([[Varni<U+0163>a]] and [[Copanca]]) on the same west bank under Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u control, form a security zone. The security situation inside it is subject to the [[Joint Control Commission]] rulings.

The main transportation route in Transnistria is the road Tiraspol-Dub<U+0103>sari-R<U+00EE>bni<U+0163>a. North and south of Dub<U+0103>sari it passes through the lands of the villages controlled by the central government ([[Doro<U+0163>caia]], [[Cocieri]], [[Roghi]], while [[Vasilievca]] is entirely situated east of the road). Conflict erupted on several occasions when the Tiraspol authorities prevented the villagers from reaching their farmland east of the road.<ref>Trygve Kalland and Claus Neukirch, [http://www.osce.org/moldova/item_2_15957.html Moldovan Mission seeks solution to Dorotcaia's bitter harvest], [[OSCE]], 2005-08-10</ref><ref>[http://en.rian.ru/world/20070113/59017865.html New checkpoint to appear in Moldova conflict zone after clash], [[RIA Novosti]], 2007-01-13</ref><ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2627545,00.html Locuitorii satului Vasilievca de pe malul st<U+00E2>ng al Nistrului tr<U+0103>iesc clipe de co<U+015F>mar], [[Deutsche Welle]], 2005-03-17</ref>

Transnistrians are able to travel (normally without difficulty) in and out of the territory under PMR control to neighbouring Moldovan-controlled territory, to Ukraine, and on to Russia, by road or (when service is not interrupted by political tensions) on two international trains, the year-round Moscow-Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u, and the seasonal [[Saratov]]-[[Varna]].<ref>''[[Tiraspol Times]]'', 2007-07-08, http://www.tiraspoltimes.com/node/967 {{Dead link|date=December 2009}}</ref> International air travellers rely on the airport in [[Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u]], the Moldovan capital, or the airport in [[Odessa]], in Ukraine.

===Administrative subdivisions===
Transnistria is subdivided into five ''[[raion]]s'' (Russian names are listed in parentheses):
* [[Administrative Region of Camenca|Camenca]] (<U+041A><U+00E1><U+043C><U+0435><U+043D><U+043A><U+0430>, Kamenka)

Also, [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] (Tighina; <U+0411><U+0435><U+043D><U+0434><U+00E9><U+0440><U+044B>), situated on the western bank of the Dniester (in [[Bessarabia]]), geographically outside Transnistria, is not part of territorial unit Transnistria of Moldova as defined by the central authorities, but is controlled by the PMR authorities, which consider it part of PMR's administrative organization.

==Political status==
{{Citations missing|date=July 2010}}
{{Main|Disputed status of Transnistria}}

Transnistria is recognised by the vast majority of countries as a legal part of the [[Republic of Moldova]], although [[South Ossetia]] and [[Abkhazia]] recognize it as a sovereign entity after it declared independence from Moldova in 1990 with Tiraspol as its declared capital.

Between 1929 and 1940, [[Tiraspol]] was the capital of the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavian ASSR]], an autonomous republic within [[Ukrainian SSR]], which existed from 1924 to 1940.

Although exercising no direct control over the territory, the Moldovan government passed the "Law on Basic Provisions of the Special Legal Status of Localities from the Left Bank of the Dniester" on 22 July 2005, which established Transnistria as an autonomous territorial unit within the Republic of Moldova. The law was passed without any prior consultation with the de facto government in Transnistria, which called it a provocation, and has since ignored it.

Between 300,000 and 400,000 Transnistrians (the majority of the population) acquired Moldovan passports by 2008. No country recognizes passports issued by the Transnistrian government.<ref>[http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/202076,voronin-calls-transnistria-conflict-very-resolvable--feature.html Voronin calls Transnistria conflict 'very resolvable' ([[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]])]</ref><ref>[http://azi.md/news?ID=45205 Nearly 400 thousand Transnistrians have Moldovan passports (azi.md)]</ref> Russia opened a consulate in Tiraspol (against the will of Moldova) and issued about 80,000 passports to Transnistrians by the end of 2006.<ref name=msca>[http://www.peacebuilding.md/library/153/en/Moldova%20Strategic%20Conflict%20Assessment%202006.pdf Moldova Strategic Conflict Assessment (SCA)], Stuart Hensel, Economist Intelligence Unit.</ref>

There are unsettled [[Disputed status of Transnistria|border issues]] between Transnistria and Moldova. Nine villages from the [[Raionul Dub<U+0103>sari|Dub<U+0103>sari district]], including [[Cocieri]] and [[Doro<U+0163>caia]] which geographically belong to Transnistria, have been under the control of the central government of [[Moldova]] after the involvement of local inhabitants on the side of Moldovan forces during the [[War of Transnistria]]. These villages along with [[Varni<U+0163>a]] and [[Copanca]], near [[Bendery]] and Tiraspol, are claimed by the PMR. One city and six villages on the west bank are controlled by the Transnistrian authorities, but are considered by Moldova as a separate municipality (Bender and two villages), or part of the [[Raionul C<U+0103>u<U+015F>eni|C<U+0103>u<U+015F>eni district]] (four villages).

Tense situations have periodically surfaced due to these territorial disputes, such as in 2005, when Transnistrian forces entered Vasilievca,<ref>Moldova Azi, [http://www.azi.md/news?ID=33404, Transnistrian Militia Withdrew Its Posts from Vasilievca]. Retrieved 2006-10-18.</ref> in 2006 around Varni<U+0163>a, and in 2007 in Dub<U+0103>sari-Cocieri area, when a confrontation between Moldovan and Transnistrian forces occurred, however without any casualties.

===Transnistria border customs dispute===
{{Main|Transnistria border customs issue}}

<!-- PLEASE do not expand this section beyond the very basic summary. Edit the "main article" instead -->
On 3 March 2006, [[Ukraine]] introduced new customs regulations on its border with Transnistria. Ukraine declared that it would import only goods from Transnistria with documents processed by Moldovan [[customs]] offices as part of the implementation of the joint customs protocol agreed between Ukraine and Moldova on 30 December 2005. Transnistria and Russia termed the act an "economic blockade."

The United States, the European Union and [[OSCE]] approved the Ukrainian move, while Russia saw it as a means of political pressure. On 4 March, Transnistria responded by blocking the Moldovan and Ukrainian transport at the borders of Transnistria. The Transnistrian block was lifted after two weeks. However, the Moldovan/Ukrainian block remains in place, and holds up progress in status settlement negotiations between the sides.<ref>[http://www.olvia.idknet.com/ol79-02-07.htm Olvia Press: "Valeri Litskai: A situation based on pressure and threats cannot be considered favorable for the revival of contacts"]</ref> In the months after the regulations, exports from Transnistria declined drastically.

===Russian military presence in Transnistria===
{{See also|14th Army involvement in Transnistria}}
A 1,200-strong Russian military contingent is present in Transnistria. The status of this contingent is disputed. The 1992 cease-fire agreement between Moldova and Transnistria established a Russian peace-keeper presence in Transnistria. Russian troops stationed in Moldova proper since the time of the USSR were fully withdrawn to Russia by January 1993.

On 21 October 1994, Russia and Moldova signed an agreement that committed Russia to the withdrawal of the troops in three years from the date of entry into force of the agreement,<ref>"Nezavisimaya Moldova", 25 October 1994; Informative Report of FAM of RM, nr.2, October 1994, pp. 5-6</ref> this however did not come into effect because the Russian [[State Duma|Duma]] did not ratify it.<ref name="DFSTATES" /> The [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]] (CFE) included a paragraph about the removal of Russian troops from Moldova's territory and was introduced into the text of the [[OSCE]] Summit Declaration of [[Istanbul]] (1999), in which Russia had committed itself to pulling out its troops from Transnistria by the end of 2002.<ref>Mihai Grecu, Anatol <U+0162><U+0103>ranu, Trupele Ruse <U+00EE>n Republica Moldova (Culegere de documente <U+015F>i materiale). Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u, 2004 , p. 600.</ref> However, even after 2002, the Russian parliament did not ratify the Istanbul accords. On 19 July 2004, after it finally passed through parliament President [[Vladimir Putin]] signed the Law on the ratification of the CFE Treaty in Europe, which committed Russia to remove the heavy armaments limited by this Treaty.<ref>"Interfax", Moscow, in Russian, 0850 gmt, 7 July 2004</ref> During 2000-2001, although the CFE Treaty was not fully ratified, to comply with it, Moscow withdrew 125 pieces of Treaty Limited Equipment (TLE) and 60 railway wagons containing ammunition from the Transnistrian region of Moldova. In 2002, Russia withdrew 3 military equipment trains (118 railway wagons) and 2 of ammunition (43 wagons) from the Transnistrian region of Moldova, and in 2003, 11 rail convoys transporting military equipment and 31 transporting ammunitions. According to the [[OSCE Mission to Moldova]], of a total of 42,000 tons of ammunitions stored in Transnistria, 1,153 tons (3%) was transported back to Russia in 2001, 2,405 tons (6%) in 2002 and 16,573 tons (39%) in 2003.

[[Andrei Stratan]], the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs of Moldova]] stated in his speech during the 12th OSCE Ministerial Council Meeting in [[Sofia]] on 6<U+2013>7 December 2004 that "The presence of Russian troops on the territory of the Republic of Moldova is against the political will of Moldovan constitutional authorities and defies the unanimously recognized international norms and principles, being qualified by Moldovan authorities as a foreign military occupation illegally deployed on the territory of the state".<ref name=gribincea>Mihai Gribincea, [http://politicom.moldova.org/news/russian-troops-in-transnistria-a-threat-to-the-security-of-the-republic-of-moldova-20998-eng.html "Russian troops in Transnistria<U+2013>a threat to the security of the Republic of Moldova", Institute of Political and Military Studies, Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u, Moldova] Russia continues to 'sustain the Dniestr region as a quasi-independent entity through direct and indirect means'</ref><ref>MC.DEL/21/04, 2004-12-06</ref> As of 2007 however, Russia insists that it has already fulfilled those obligations.

==Demographics==
[[File:Transnistria evolutie etnica.png|thumb|right|Demographic evolution in Transnistria]]
{{Main|Demographics of Moldova}}
In 2004, Transnistrian authorities organized [[2004 Census in Transnistria|a separate census]] from the [[2004 Moldovan Census]].<ref>[http://www.unece.org/stats/trends2005/notes.htm Trends in Europe and North America (Explanatory Notes)], United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).</ref>

In total, in the areas controlled by the breakaway authorities of Tiraspol, there are 555,347 people, including 177,635 [[Moldovans]] (31.99%), 168,678 [[Russians]] (30.37%), 160,069 [[Ukrainians]] (28.82%), 13,858 [[Bulgarians]] (2.50%), 4,096 [[Gagauzians]] (0.74%), 507 [[Romani people|Gypsies]] ([[Roma people|Roma]]) (0.09%), 1,259 Jews (0.23%), 1,791 [[Poles]] (0.32%), and 27,454 others (4.94%).<ref>[http://www.olvia.idknet.com/ol37-09-05.htm Official data from 2004 census and comparison with the 1989 census, by Olvia Press]</ref><ref>[http://www.pridnestrovie.net/2004census.html Pridnestrovie.net: "2004 Census: PMR urban, multilingual, multicultural"] from http://www.pridnestrovie.net retrieved 2006-02-24</ref>

Of these, 439,243 live in Transnistria itself, and 116,104 live in localities controlled by the authorities from Tiraspol, but formally belonging to other districts of Moldova (the city of [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] (Tighina), the communes of [[Proteagailovca]], [[G<U+00EE>sca]], [[Chi<U+0163>cani, Moldova|Chi<U+0163>cani]], [[Cremenciug, C<U+0103>u<U+015F>eni|Cremenciug]], and village of ''Roghi'' of commune [[Molovata Nou<U+0103>]]).

Moldovans (Romanians) are the most numerous ethnic group, representing an overall majority in the two sub-districts in the central Transnistria ([[Dub<U+0103>sari sub-district, Transnistria|Dub<U+0103>sari sub-district]], 50.15%, and [[Grigoriopol sub-district, Transnistria|Grigoriopol sub-district]], 64.83%), a 47.82% relative majority in the northern [[Camenca sub-district, Transnistria|Camenca sub-district]], and a 41.52% relative majority in the southern ([[Slobozia sub-district, Transnistria|Slobozia sub-district]]). In R<U+00E2>bni<U+0163>a sub-district they are a 29.90% minority, and in the city of [[Tiraspol]], they constitute a 15.24% minority of the population.

Ukrainians are the second numerous ethnic group, representing a 45.41% relative majority in the northern [[R<U+00E2>bni<U+0163>a sub-district, Transnistria|R<U+00E2>bni<U+0163>a sub-district]], a 42.55% minority in Camenca, a 32.97% minority in Tiraspol, a 28.29% minority in Dub<U+0103>sari, a 23.42% minority in Slobozia, and a 17.36% minority in Grigoriopol.

Russians are the third numerous ethnic group, representing a 41.64% relative majority in the city of [[Tiraspol]], a 24.07% minority in Slobozia, a 19.03% minority in Dub<U+0103>sari, a 17.22% minority in R<U+00E2>bni<U+0163>a, a 15.28% minority in Grigoriopol, and a 6.89% minority in Camenca.

Bulgarians are the fourth largest ethnic group in Transnistria, albeit much less numerous than the three larger ethnicities. Most Bulgarians in Transnistria are [[Bessarabian Bulgarians]], descendants of expatriates who settled in [[Bessarabia]] in the 18th<U+2013>19th century. The major centre of Bulgarians in Transnistria is the large village of [[Parcani, Transnistria|Parcani]], which has an absolute Bulgarian majority and a total population of around 10,000.

In Bender (Tighina) and the other non-Transnistria localities under Tiraspol control, ethnic Russians represent a 43.43% relative majority, followed by Moldovans (Romanians) at 26.15%, Ukrainians at 17.08%, Bulgarians at 2.89%, Gagauzians at 1.03%, Jews as 0.34%, Poles at 0.17%, Gypsies at 0.13%, and others at 7.78%.

At the [[1989 Census in Transnistria|census of 1989]], the population was 679,000 (including all the localities in the security zone, even those under Moldovan control). The ethnic composition of the region has not been stable [[Demographic history of Transnistria|in recent history]], with the most notable change being the decreasing share of Moldovan and Jewish population segments and increase of the Russian. For example, the percentage of Russians grew from 13.7% in 1926 to 25.5% in 1989 and further to 30.4% in 2004, while the Moldovan population decreased from 44.1% in 1926 to 39.9% in 1989 and 31.9% in 2004. Only the proportion of Ukrainians remained reasonably stable - 27.2% in 1926, 28.3% in 1989 and 28.8 in 2004.

==Religion==
PMR official statistics show that 91 percent of the Transnistrian population adhere to [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]], with 4 percent adhering to [[Roman Catholicism]].<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,COUNTRYPROF,RUS,,4954ce57c,0.html UNHCR | Refworld | World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples - Transnistria (unrecognised state) : Overview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Roman Catholics are mainly located in Northern Transnistria, where a notable [[Poles|Polish]] minority is living.<ref>[http://ceumonitor.group.googlepages.com/Transnistria_ethnicity.jpg/Transnistria_ethnicity-full.jpg Ethnic map of Transnistria]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref>

Transnistria's government has supported the restoration and construction of new orthodox churches. It affirms that the republic has [[freedom of religion]] and states that 114 religious beliefs and congregations are officially registered. However, as recently as 2005, registration hurdles were met with by some religious groups, notably the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].<ref>[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51569.htm Moldova, International Religious Freedom Report 2005], released by the US Department of State Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor</ref> In 2007, the US-based [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] denounced the persecution of [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in Transnistria.<ref>[http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/133101.aspx Christians Face Abuse from Corrupt Regime]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}, by Gary Lane, ''[[CBN News]]'', 2007-04-06</ref>

==Economy==
Transnistria has a [[mixed economy]].

The economy is based on a mix of [[heavy industry]] (steel production), electricity production and [[manufacturing]] (textile production), which together account for about 80% of the total industrial output.<ref name=viitorul>[http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/getdocument.aspx?logid=5&id=18fc81ca-d52d-4a8a-98fb-63ea194fd695 Transnistria], Center for Economic Polices of IDIS "Viitorul"</ref>

Transnistria has its own [[Transnistrian Republican Bank|central bank]], which issues Transnistrian currency, the [[Transnistrian ruble]]. It is convertible at a freely floating exchange rate but only in Transnistria.<ref>[http://www.pridnestrovie.net/money.html Pridnestrovie's own currency], Pridnestrovie.net</ref>

===Economic history===
After World War II, Transnistria was heavily industrialised, to the point that in 1990, it was responsible for 40% of Moldova's GDP and 90% of its electricity<ref>John Mackinlay and Peter Cross (editors), ''Regional Peacekeepers: The Paradox of Russian Peacekeeping'', United Nations University Press, 2003, ISBN 92-808-1079-0 p. 135</ref> although it accounted for only 17% of Moldova's population. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Transnistria wanted to return to a "Brezhnev-style [[planned economy]]".<ref>John B. Dunlop, "Will a Large-Scale Migration of Russians to the Russian Republic Take Place over the Current Decade?", in ''International Migration Review'', Vol. 27, No. 3. (Autumn, 1993), pp. 605-629, citing ''Russian Radio'', 1992-09-21 in ''Russia and CIS Today'', WPS, 1992-09-21, p. 976/16.</ref> However, several years later, it decided to head toward a [[market economy]].

===Macroeconomics===
According to the government of Transnistria, the 2007 GDP was 6789 mln Transnistrian roubles (appx US$799&nbsp;million) and the GDP per capita was about US$1,500. The GDP increased by 11.1% and inflation rate was 19.3%.<ref name=stat2007>[http://www.vspmr.org/Upload/File/doklad2007.rar <U+0414><U+043E><U+043A><U+043B><U+0430><U+0434> <U+00AB><U+0421><U+043E><U+0446><U+0438><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+043D><U+043E>-<U+044D><U+043A><U+043E><U+043D><U+043E><U+043C><U+0438><U+0447><U+0435><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0435> <U+0440><U+0430><U+0437><U+0432><U+0438><U+0442><U+0438><U+0435> <U+041F><U+0440><U+0438><U+0434><U+043D><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0439> <U+041C><U+043E><U+043B><U+0434><U+0430><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0439> <U+0420><U+0435><U+0441><U+043F><U+0443><U+0431><U+043B><U+0438><U+043A><U+0438><U+00BB> <U+0437><U+0430> 2007 <U+0433><U+043E><U+0434><U+0430> (<U+0443><U+0442><U+043E><U+0447><U+043D><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+0435>)] (''Socio-economical development of the Pridnestrovian Moldovan Republic''), statistical service of the Ministry of Economy of Transnistria</ref> Transnistria's government budget for 2007 was US$246&nbsp;million, with an estimated deficit of about US$100&nbsp;million<ref>[http://conflict.md/stiri.php?ID=2143 Transnistrian parliament adopts region's budget for 2007]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref> which the government plans to cover with income from privatizations.<ref>[http://www.tiras.ru/en/index.php?subaction=showfull&id=1172054345&archive=&start_from=&ucat=25& Privatization will solve the budget problem]{{dead link|date=October 2010}} PMR News, 2007-02-21</ref> Budget for 2008 is US$331&nbsp;million, with an estimated deficit of about US$80&nbsp;million.<ref name=nr2>[http://www.nr2.ru/pmr/152396.html <U+0415><U+0432><U+0433><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0428><U+0435><U+0432><U+0447><U+0443><U+043A>: <U+0431><U+044E><U+0434><U+0436><U+0435><U+0442> <U+041F><U+0440><U+0438><U+0434><U+043D><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+044C><U+044F><U+2013><U+043E><U+0442><U+0440><U+0430><U+0436><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+0435> <U+0440><U+0435><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+043D><U+043E><U+0439> <U+0441><U+0438><U+0442><U+0443><U+0430><U+0446><U+0438><U+0438> <U+0432> <U+044D><U+043A><U+043E><U+043D><U+043E><U+043C><U+0438><U+043A><U+0435>]</ref>

In 2004, Transnistria had debts of US$1.2&nbsp;billion (two-thirds of which are with Russia), which was per capita about six times higher than in Moldova (without Transnistria).<ref>[http://www.policy.hu/npopescu/publications/06.11%20IPF%20Democracy%20in%20secessionism.pdf Democracy in Secessionism: Transnistria and Abkhazia's Domestic Policies], by Nicu Popescu, International Policy Fellowship Program 2005/2006</ref> In March 2007 the debt to [[Gazprom]] for the acquisition of natural gas has increased to US$1.3&nbsp;billion.

Transnistria's president Igor Smirnov has announced that Transnistria will not be paying off its gas debt because "Transdnistria has no legal debt {{interp|to Gazprom}}".<ref>[http://www.kommersant.com/p756473/Transdniestr,_Moldova,_Russia/ Moscow's Hand Tired of Giving], Kommersant 6 April 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.ng.ru/economics/2007-03-23/1_gazprom.html <U+00AB><U+0413><U+0430><U+0437><U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+043C><U+00BB> <U+043F><U+0435><U+0440><U+0435><U+0434><U+0430><U+043B> <U+041F><U+0440><U+0438><U+0434><U+043D><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+044C><U+0435> <U+0410><U+043B><U+0438><U+0448><U+0435><U+0440><U+0443> <U+0423><U+0441><U+043C><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+0443>], Nezavisimaya Gazeta 23 March 2007</ref> In November 2007, the total debt of Transnistria's public sector was up to US$1.64&nbsp;billion.<ref name=nr2/>

According to [[Yevgeni Shevchuk]], speaker of [[Transnistrian Supreme Soviet]], Transnistria is in a difficult economic situation. Despite a 30% tax increase in 2007, the pension fund is still lacking money and emergency measures must be taken.<ref>[http://vspmr.org/Upload/File/conferential/eng/1.shtml Shevchuk answering a question about 2007 Transnistrian budget]</ref> However, Shevchuk mentions that the situation is not hopeless and it cannot be considered a crisis, as a crisis means three-month delays in payment of pensions and salaries.<ref>[http://vspmr.org/Upload/File/conferential/eng/5.shtml Shevchuk explaining that economical situation is not critical]</ref>

===External trade===
In 2006, the [[Transnistrian Republican Bank]] reported exports of US$422.0&nbsp;million and imports of US$738.4&nbsp;million. Compared to 2005, export decreased 27.2% and import decreased 13.7%. The trade deficit reached US$316.3&nbsp;million.<ref name=bank95>[http://www.cbpmr.net/resource/prbvd95.zip]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}, Transnistrian Republican Bank, Tiraspol 2007</ref> Over 50% of the export goes to the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]], mainly to Russia, but also to Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova (whom Transnistrian authorities consider foreign).<ref name=icg/><ref name=viitorul/> Main non-CIS markets for the Transnistrian goods are Italy, Egypt, Greece, Romania, and Germany.<ref name=icg/> The CIS accounts for over 60% of the imports, while the share of the EU is about 23%. The main imports are non-precious metals, food products and electricity.

===Economic sectors===
The leading industry is steel, due to the [[Moldova Steel Works]] (part of the Russian [[Metalloinvest]] holding) in [[R<U+00EE>bni<U+0163>a]], which accounts for about 60% of the budget revenue of Transnistria.<ref name=msca/> The largest company in the textile industry is [[Tirotex]], which claims to be the second largest textile company in Europe.<ref>[http://www.tirotex.com/index.htm Tirotex official website]</ref> The energy sector is dominated by Russian companies. The largest power company [[Kuchurgan power station|Moldavskaya GRES (Kuchurgan power station)]], which is located in [[Dnestrovsc]], is owned by [[Inter RAO UES]],<ref>[http://www.interrao.ru/_upload/editor_files/file0014.pdf Annual Report of Inter RAO UES]</ref> and the gas transmission and distribution company [[Tiraspoltransgas]] is probably controlled by [[Gazprom]], although Gazprom has not confirmed the ownership officially. The banking sector of Transnistria consists of 8 commercial banks, including [[Gazprombank (Transnistria)|Gazprombank]]. The oldest alcohol producer [[Kvint]], located in Tiraspol, produces and exports brandy, wines and vodka.

==Human rights==
{{Main|Human rights in Transnistria}}
The human rights record of Transnistria has been criticised by several governments and international organizations. The 2007 ''[[Freedom in the World]]'' report, published by the US-based [[Freedom House]], described Transnistria as a "non-free" territory, having an equally bad situation in both political rights and civil liberties.<ref>[[Freedom House]], http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/press_release/fiw07_charts.pdf 2007 "Freedom in the World" report]</ref>

According to the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] report referring to year 2006;

{{cquote|''The right of citizens to change their government<ref>the [[Government of Moldova]]</ref> was restricted[...] Authorities reportedly continued to use torture and arbitrary arrest and detention.[...]In Transnistria authorities limited freedom of speech and of the press.[...]Authorities usually did not permit free assembly.[...] In the separatist region of Transnistria the authorities continued to deny registration and harassed a number of minority religions groups.[...]The separatist region remained a significant source and transit area for trafficking in persons.[...] Homosexuality was illegal, and gays and lesbians were subject to governmental and societal discrimination.''<ref>[[United States Department of State]]: [http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78828.htm Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2006]</ref>}}

===Incidents===
[[File:Ilie Ilascu.Tiraspol.18 noiembrie 1992.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Ilie Ila<U+015F>cu]] under arrest in [[Tiraspol]], 1992]]
In the best known political trial, [[Ilie Ila<U+015F>cu]] was convicted in 1993 of killing two Transnistrian officials, and initially sentenced to death by Transnistria's Supreme Court; however, this was commuted to a life prison sentence. Three other members of his group were sentenced to terms of 12 to 15 years' imprisonment, and confiscation of their property. [[Ilie Ila<U+015F>cu|Ila<U+015F>cu]] was released in 2001, after the intervention of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] against Moldova and Russia, while the other three were released in 2004 and 2007, having served the full term of their sentences. The ECHR stated that authorities had violated the right of freedom and safety of all four members of the group, and that the treatment Ilie Ila<U+015F>cu suffered qualifies as [[torture]]. As part of the ruling the court also stated that they believed that Transnistria was "under the effective authority or at least decisive influence of Russia".<ref>[http://www.echr.coe.int/Eng/Press/2004/July/GrandChamberjudgmentIlascuandOthersvMoldovaandRussia.htm Grand Chamber judgment in the case of Ila<U+015F>cu and others v. Moldova and Russia], [[European Court of Human Rights]], 349, 2004-06-08</ref> The court also ordered Moldova and Russia<U+2014>which backs Transnistria<U+2014>to pay the four a total of <U+20AC>750,000 (US$1,000,000) in compensation for the deprivation of their freedom and for torture and inhumane treatment while in custody.<ref>[[International Herald Tribune]], [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/06/04/europe/EU-GEN-Moldova-Political-Prisoner.php Pro-Russian separatists in Moldova release last political prisoner], 2007-06-04</ref> The members of Ila<U+015F>cu group were forced into exile after their release from prison.

In March 2007 several opponents of Transnistria's Government were arrested after they made public appeals during a protest rally against the Tiraspol regime's policy.<ref>[http://politicom.moldova.org/news/transnistrian-power-wielding-forces-hold-over-ten-opponents-of-breakaway-regime-36276-eng.html Transnistrian power wielding forces hold over ten opponents of breakaway regime]</ref> On 19 March 2007 Transnistrian authorities also arrested [[<U+015E>tefan Ur<U+00EE>tu]], the leader of Moldovan [[Helsinki Committee for Human Rights]], and two other local political activists. They were later released.<ref>[http://www.conflict.md/comentarii.php?ID=2303 Separati<U+015F>tii transnistreni l-au arestat pe <U+015E>tefan Ur<U+00EE>tu <U+015F>i doi membri ai unui ONG local]{{dead link|date=October 2010}} (in Romanian)</ref>

According to the Moldovan [http://infotag.md/ InfoTag news agency], Transnistrian authorities blockaded the polling station at [[Corjova, Dub<U+0103>sari|Corjova]] village, not allowing residents to participate in the Moldovan elections of 3 June 2007.<ref>[http://www.infotag.md/knewsen/74795/ Prokuratura initials proceedings on Corjova case]</ref> At the same occasion, Iurie Co<U+0163>ofan<U+0103>, a local antiseparatist councilor was arrested and beaten.

In April 2010 the journalist [[Ernest Vardanean]] was arrested, being accused of espionage in favour of Moldova<ref>[http://www.jurnal.md/en/news/journalist-arrested-in-tiraspol-for-being-moldovan-spy-184293/ report about Vardanean case in Jurnal de Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u]</ref>

A similar case was that of Ilie Cazacu from [[Bender]], arrested in 19 March 2010 for high treason and espionage in favour of Moldova, and of Elena Dobrovi<U+0163>caia, also from Bender, who was arrested because her mother went to a hospital in Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u instead of presenting herself at the request of the authorities from Bender.<ref>[http://www.azi.md/en/story/12139 Bender woman held hostage by Transnistrian authorities]</ref> As the parents of Ilie Cazacu didn't receive news about him, they started a [[hunger strike]] in June 2010 in front of the [[Russian Embassy in Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u]].<ref>[http://www.publika.md/parintii-lui-ilie-cazacu--arestat-la-bender-pe-19-martie--intentioneaza-sa-declare-greva-foamei-in-fata-ambasadei-federatiei-ruse-din-chisinau_34951.html Publika TV (Romanian) The parrents of Ilie Cazacu telling that they will start hunger strike]</ref><ref>[http://www.azi.md/en/story/12029 Ilie Cazac's parents did not seek help from the police]</ref>

===Situation of the media===
{{Main|Media in Transnistria}}

There is a regular mix of modern news media in Transnistria with a number of television stations, newspapers, and radio stations.

According to the [[OSCE]], the media climate in Transnistria is restrictive and the authorities continue a long-standing campaign to silence independent opposition voices and groups.<ref>[http://www.osce.org/moldova/13427.html OSCE - Media in Transdniestria]</ref>

According to a U.S. Department of State report for 2006, "Both of region's major newspapers were controlled by the authorities. There was one independent weekly newspaper in [[Bendery]] and another in the northern city of R<U+00EE>bni<U+0163>a.[...]Separatist authorities harassed independent newspapers for critical reporting of the Transnistrian regime.[...]Most television and radio stations and print publication were controlled by Transnistrian authorities, which largely dictated their editorial policies and finance operations. Some broadcast networks, such as the TSV television station and the INTER-FM radio station, were owned by Transnistria's largest monopoly, Sheriff, which also holds a majority in the region's legislature.[...]In July 2005 the Transnistrian Supreme Soviet amended the election code to prohibit media controlled by the Transnistrian authorities from publishing results of polls and forecasts related to elections."<ref name="ReferenceA">[[United States Department of State]] report for 2006</ref>

===Moldovan schools===
{{Main|Moldovan schools in Transnistria}}
Public education in the [[Romanian language]] is done using the Soviet-originated [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet]]. The usage of the [[Latin script]] (the norm) was restricted to only 6 schools. [[Moldovan schools in Transnistria|Four of these schools]] were forcibly closed by the authorities, who claimed this was due to the refusal of the schools to apply for official accreditation.<ref>[http://www.olvia.idknet.com/news15-07-04.htm Statement by the Ministry of Education, Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, on the question of children's educational rights insurance], published by [[Olvia-Press]] 2004-07-15</ref> These schools were later registered as private schools and reopened. This process may have been accelerated by pressure from the European Union<ref>[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/ChildrenHRDecember2005.pdf Several Transnistrian officials were banned from traveling through EU]</ref>

The OSCE mission to Moldova has urged local authorities in the Transnistrian city of R<U+00EE>bni<U+0163>a to return a confiscated building to the Moldovan Latin script school in the city. The unfinished building was nearing completion in 2004, when Transnistria took control of it during that year's school crisis.<ref>[http://www.osce.org/item/22208.html?print=1 Ribnitsa's authorities must return the confiscated school building, says OSCE Mission Head]</ref>

"In November 2005 [[Ion Iovcev]], the principal of a Romanian-language school in Transnistria and active advocate for human rights as well as a critic of the Transnistrian leadership, received threatening calls that he attributed to his criticism of the separatist regime."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Military==
[[File:PMR-MVDBadge.jpg|thumb|upright|Ministry of Interior badge insignia]]
As of 2007, the [[Military of Transnistria|armed forces and the paramilitary of Transnistria]] were composed of 4,500-7,500 soldiers, divided into four motorized infantry brigades in [[Tiraspol]], [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]], [[R<U+00EE>bni<U+0163>a]], and [[Dub<U+0103>sari]].<ref>km.ru, [http://www.km.ru/magazin/view.asp?id=B5A90475FA6B4800A679D5F28F31C354 <U+041F><U+0440><U+0438><U+0434><U+043D><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+044C><U+0435> <U+043F><U+043E><U+043A><U+0430><U+0437><U+0430><U+043B><U+043E> <U+043C><U+0443><U+0441><U+043A><U+0443><U+043B><U+044B>], 06.09.2007 {{ru icon}}</ref> They have 18 tanks, 107 armoured carriers, 73 guns, 46 anti-aircraft installations, and 173 tank destroyer units.

==Arms control and disarmament==
Following the collapse of the former Soviet Union, the Russian 14th Army left 40,000 tonnes of weapony and ammunition. In later years there were concerns{{Who|date=October 2010}} that the Transnistrian authorities would try to sell these stocks internationally, and intense pressure was applied to have these removed by the [[Russia|Russian Federation]].

In 2000 and 2001, the Russian Federation withdrew by rail 141 self-propelled artillery and other armoured vehicles and destroyed locally 108 [[T-64 tank]]s and 139 other pieces of military equipment limited by the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]] (CFE). During 2002 and 2003 Russian military officials destroyed a further 51 armoured vehicles, all of which were types not limited by the CFE Treaty. The [[OSCE]] also observed and verified the withdrawal of the 48 trains with military equipment and ammunition in 2003. However, no further withdrawal activities have taken place since March 2004 and a further 20,000 tons of ammunition, as well as some remaining military equipment are still to be removed.

In the autumn of 2006 the Transnistria leadership agreed to let an OSCE inspectorate examine the munitions and further access agreed moving forward.
Recent weapons inspections were permitted by Transnistria and conducted by the OSCE.<ref>[http://www.tiraspoltimes.com/node/278 UN Report clears Transdniester of weapons smuggling; Praises transparency and co-operation] ''Tiraspol Times''. 2006-10-16.

Retrieved 2007-02-21.</ref> The onus of responsibility rests on the Russian Federation to remove the rest of the supplies.

Transnistrian authorities declared that they are not involved in the manufacture or export of weapons.<ref>[http://pridnestrovie.net/weaponsmanufacture.html PMR doesn't make weapons, experts admit]</ref> The OSCE and European Union officials stated in 2005 that there is no evidence that Transnistria "has ever trafficked arms or nuclear material" and much of the alarm is due to Moldovan government's attempts to pressure Transnistria.<ref name="feg">[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/10/05f3742a-1c2d-4e1a-a57f-0e9780549795.html RFE/RL: Western Diplomats Say Reports Of Smuggling From Transdniester Likely Exaggerated]</ref>

In 2007, foreign experts working on behalf of the United Nations said that the historically low levels of transparency and continued denial of full investigation to international monitors have reinforced negative perceptions of the Transnistrian regime, although recent cooperation by Transnitrian authorities may have reflected a shift in the attitude of Transnistria.<ref name=seesac>[http://www.seesac.org/reports/ENGLISH.pdf UNDP: 2006 Small arms and light weapons survey of Moldova]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}, SEESAC 1 July 2007, ISBN 86-7728-014-6</ref> Their report stated that the evidence for the illicit production and trafficking of weapons into and from Transnistria has in the past been exaggerated, although the trafficking of light weapons is likely to have occurred before 2001 (the last year when export data showed US$ 900,000 worth of 'weapons, munitions, their parts and accessories' exported from Transnistria). The report also states that the same holds true for the production of such weapons, which is likely to have been carried out in the 1990s primarily to equip Transnistrian forces.

The OSCE mission spokesman Claus Neukirch spoke about this situation: "There is often talk about sale of armaments from Transnistria, but there is no convincing evidence."<ref>Conflict Studies Research Centre, [http://www.defac.ac.uk/colleges/csrc/document-listings/cee/05(07)-GPH.pdf Moldova & The Dniestr Region: Contested Past, Frozen Present, Speculative Futures?], Graeme P.
