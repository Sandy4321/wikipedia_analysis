It admits [[Education in Thailand|upper-secondary]] students (''mathayom'' 4<U+2013>6, equivalent to grades 10<U+2013>12) and has the largest yearly enrolment in the country. Founded in 1938 as a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] for [[Chulalongkorn University]], the school has long been regarded as one of the best secondary schools in Thailand,<ref>Fry, "Education and Success"</ref> and attracts students from all over the country in its highly competitive entrance examinations. Triam Udom Suksa has among the highest university entry rates for Thai schools, and its students consistently score among the top in national standardised tests.

== History ==
The founding of Triam Udom Suksa School relates to the revised National Education Plan of BE&nbsp;2479 (1936&nbsp;CE), which imposed four and six years of [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]] respectively, with an additional two years of precollegiate schooling required for  students who were to pursue higher education. This precollegiate level was to be initially provided by the students' prospective universities, and accordingly the University Council of [[Chulalongkorn University]] authorized the establishment of such a school on 3 January 1938. The founding of the school, which took place over a tight time frame of three months, was overseen by Mom Luang [[Pin Malakul]], then head of the university's teacher-preparation programme, who became the school's first director. The school took over the location of Matthayom Horwang School (of which ML Pin was also headmaster) on Phaya Thai Road in the vicinity of the university, and became known as the "University Preparatory School, Chulalongkorn University", or ''Rong Rian Triam Udom Suksa Haeng Chulalongkorn Maha Witthayalai'' ({{lang|th|<U+0E42><U+0E23><U+0E07><U+0E40><U+0E23><U+0E35><U+0E22><U+0E19><U+0E40><U+0E15><U+0E23><U+0E35><U+0E22><U+0E21><U+0E2D><U+0E38><U+0E14><U+0E21><U+0E28><U+0E36><U+0E01><U+0E29><U+0E32><U+0E41><U+0E2B><U+0E48><U+0E07><U+0E08><U+0E38><U+0E2C><U+0E32><U+0E25><U+0E07><U+0E01><U+0E23><U+0E13><U+0E21><U+0E2B><U+0E32><U+0E27><U+0E34><U+0E17><U+0E22><U+0E32><U+0E25><U+0E31><U+0E22>}}; ''triam udom suksa'' literally translates as [[University-preparatory school|university-preparatory [school]]]). The school, which was the first [[co-education]]al in the country, opened on 16 May 1938, and classes began on 19 May.<ref name="70th Anniv">Janehutthakarnkij et al., "Triam Udom Suksa School 70th Anniversary".</ref>

[[Image:Building 1, Triam Udom Suksa School.jpg|thumb|left|The name of Mathayom Horwang School is still displayed on the fa<U+00E7>ade of Building&nbsp;1.]]
The school rapidly grew over the first few years, admitting up to 568 students in the 1940 academic year. In December 1941, however, the school was raided and occupied by Japanese forces invading Thailand in the course of [[World War II]], forcing the staff and students to relocate to temporary locations around Bangkok. Teaching was hence adversely affected throughout the time of war. Classes briefly returned to the school in 1943, but had to again leave after the school was damaged by Allied bombing on 19 January 1944. Part of the staff and students were transferred to various cities around the country, where preparations had already taken place for the establishment of additional preparatory school campuses. (Changes of government policy would however later cause these campuses to close down.) The school remained occupied even at the conclusion of the war, this time by Allied forces.

Teaching finally returned to normal in 1946 after Allied forces withdrew from the school. During that period, government policy favoured expanding precollegiate-level teaching to public schools under the Department of General Education instead of being provided by the universities. As a result, authority over the school was transferred from Chulalongkorn University to the Department of General Education on 1 July 1947. The school's students have since been required to take university entrance examinations as regular students, and the name of the school was shortened to "Triam Udom Suksa School". The school, however, retained use of the [[Phra Kiao]] as its symbol.

In June 1947, just prior to the transfer, a Teacher Training Department was created under the school's authority to support the expansion of the national school system. This department, which became known as the ''Satit'' (demonstration) School, would extend teaching to ''mathayom'' 1<U+2013>6 levels, and authority was transferred to the College of Education (now [[Srinakharinwirot University]]) in 1955. It presently exists as [[Patumwan Demonstration School, Srinakharinwirot University|Patumwan Demonstration School]].

The demand for precollegiate-level schooling saw a sharp increase in the late 1950s, resulting in the Department of Secondary Education setting up special precollegiate schools within regular school campuses. Such a school was set up near Orachon Canal in the eastern portion of Triam Udom Suksa School in 1958, and became known as "Triam Orachon". Another campus, Triam Bang Pu, was established at Bang Pu Seaside Resort in [[Samut Prakan Province]] before being moved to [[Amphoe Sam Phran|Sam Phran District]], [[Nakhon Pathom Province]], and became known as Triam Udom Suksa Sam Phran School. Both schools were merged with Triam Udom Suksa by 1964.

In 1960, the national curriculum was rewritten, and the educational stages were redefined with seven years' primary education and five years of secondary education. Two years' upper-secondary education, ''mathayom'' 4<U+2013>5, replaced the precollegiate level. The school now taught in this level, and classes were divided into arts, sciences and general departments. The curriculum would be changed again in 1981, introducing the current three-year upper-secondary level (''mathayom'' 4<U+2013>6).

Since the 1950s, the school staff have on multiple occasions been assigned by the Ministry of Education to assist other schools in staff training and teaching strategy development. In anticipation of the possible need to relocate in the 1970s, the school helped found the [[Bodindecha (Sing Singhaseni) School|Bodindecha]] and [[Triam Udom Suksa Pattanakarn School|Triam Udom Suksa Pattanakarn]] Schools in 1975 and 1978. Queen's College, Ratchaburi was established with like assistance in 1992.

The school saw further expansion in the 1980s, partly due to the new national curriculum, and now had ninety classes. Several new buildings were built, and modern facilities were introduced, including the introduction of computer classes in 1992. The school received awards from the Department of General Education in 1982 and 1985, and the school library won awards in 1990 and 1991. Students featured prominently in national stages, and since 1990 have continuously won medals at the [[International Science Olympiad]]s.

At present, Triam Udom Suksa School educates upper-secondary students in the ''mathayom'' 4<U+2013>6 levels. As of the 2007 academic year, there were 105 classes with 4,617 students and 194 teachers.<ref>Triam Udom Suksa School, "Triam Udom Suksa School Annual Report 2007".</ref>

==Campus==
[[Image:Bird's-eye view of Triam Udom Suksa School.jpg|thumb|left|Bird's-eye view of the school area, with Building&nbsp;2 at the center]]
[[Image:Campus plan of Triam Udom Suksa School.png|thumb|right|Plan of the school campus]]
Triam Udom Suksa School is located at 227 Phaya Thai Rd., [[Pathum Wan]], [[Bangkok]], amongst the campus of [[Chulalongkorn University]]. The school occupies 9.2 hectares{{Fact|date=February 2008}}<!-- This is admittedly original research, measured from Google Maps, but there doesn't seem to be a source for the oft-quoted 81 rai (12.6 ha) figure either.--> between Phaya Thai and Henry Dunant Roads, and shares borders with the [[Patumwan Demonstration School, Srinakharinwirot University|Patumwan Demonstration School]] of Srinakharinwirot University and <!-- formerly?--> the Uthenthawai campus of Rajamangala University of Technology Tawan-ok, in addition to the many faculties of Chulalongkorn University.

The school has sixteen buildings, nine of which hold classrooms. The oldest buildings are lined along the school's main street which connects the two major roads bordering the school. The other buildings are scattered around the school campus, which is dominated by the sports field.

The oldest building, Building&nbsp;1, was built in 1935 as the new site for the Mathayom Horwang School of Chulalongkorn University when it relocated from its former "Windsor Palace" site, and has been home to Triam Udom Suksa School since 1938. Construction of Buildings 2 and 3 followed in 1938 and 1940 to accommodate the school's early growth. These early structures were designed with influences from the [[Bauhaus]] and [[De Stijl]] movements by Italian architect [[Ercole Manfredi]].<ref>Noobanjong, "Power, Identity, and the Rise of Modern Architecture".</ref> Building&nbsp;2 is arguably the central architectural structure of the school.

The other classroom buildings are Building&nbsp;8, Khun Ying Rang Kantarat Building, Building&nbsp;9, the Arts Building, and the 55th and 60th Anniversary Buildings. Other buildings include the library, auditorium, science lab, gymnasium, and the 50th Anniversary Building, which holds many of the student clubs.

==Curriculum==
The school follows the national Curriculum of Basic Education, BE&nbsp;2544 (2001&nbsp;CE), providing three years of upper-secondary education, Mathayom 4<U+2013>6. Subjects are grouped into eight basic subject areas, namely [[Thai language]]; [[mathematics]]; [[science]]; [[social studies]], religion and culture; [[Health education|health]] and [[Physical education class|physical education]]; arts; vocations and technology; and foreign languages.

The school's [[curriculum]] consists of three levels. The basic level consists of all of the eight main subject areas, and is offered to all students, following the national curriculum. The second level divides the three main courses offered by the school according to their subject concentration into the science-mathematics, language-mathematics, and language concentrations. The third level provides subjects of more specialized interests. Overall, the school offers twelve specific courses of study, in which all students fulfill the national basic education requirements upon graduation.

=== Programs ===
The school has 11 different programs for different needs to develop students' potentialities. There are 6 majors and 7 electives:

{|style="width:50%;"
|style="vertical-align:top;"|
'''Majors'''
# Science - Math
# Arts - Math
# Arts - French
# Arts - German
# Arts - Japanese
# Arts - Spanish
|
'''Electives'''
# Computer
# Applied Science
# Management
# Quality of life
# Basic French
# Basic German
# Basic Japanese
|}

The students majored in Science - Math can choose an elective while the students majored in Arts - Math have to study the Management and the students majored in Arts - languages have to study the Quality of life

On account of these electives, The Science - Math students are divided into 7 programs. 7 Science programs with 6 Arts programs, the number of programs in the school seems to be the most in Thailand.

==Academics==
Triam Udom Suksa School has long had among the highest university entry rates for Mathayom 6 students in Thailand, with 87.37 percent of students passing the university entrance examinations in 2003.<ref>Planning Department, "Annual Report 2002".</ref> Under the new O-NET examination system, the school's students averaged 363.54 out of 500 points in the 2006 academic year, the highest among schools under the Offices of the Basic and Private Education Commissions and university demonstration schools<ref>National Institute of Educational Testing Service, "O-NET examination results, 2006 academic year".</ref> (which does not however include [[Mahidol Wittayanusorn School]], whose students averaged 376.91 points over Triam Udom Suksa's 355.53 points in the 2005 academic year<ref>Kom-Chad-Luek, "Top-50 school O-NET rankings".</ref> and had the highest three-year (2005<U+2013>2007) average of 75.40 per cent, while Triam Udom Suksa ranked second at 71.01 per cent.)<ref>Matichon, "MOE announces 2009 O-NET schedule"</ref>

The school's culture tends to highly value academic achievements, although its students have also excelled in many other extracurricular activities. Recipients of the [[King's Scholarship (Thailand)|King's Scholarship]] and medal-winners in the [[International Science Olympiad]]s<U+2014>national stages in which the school has long dominated<ref>Fredrickson & Canyook, "Developing Thailand<U+2019>s other Olympians"</ref><U+2014>are honored in the school's [[hall of fame]], room 111.

Triam Udom Suksa is also a partner school of the initiative "[[Schulen: Partner der Zukunft]]" by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

==Extracurricular activities==
[[Extracurricular activity|Student activities]] are mostly structured around the elected student committee and the 43 student clubs supported by the school. Among the various clubs are the Thai Traditional Music Club, whose [[mahori]] ensemble has won multiple national championships, the Triam Udom Suksa "Wing!" Symphony Orchestra, which won first prize in the 8th Asian Symphonic Band Competition 2006, and the school chorus, which has also won multiple competitions, including Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn's Cup in 2006. Students regularly participate in regional and national academic competitions; the school' team is usually a major player in the televised ''[[Shell Quiz]]'' programme.

As with many other schools in Thailand, a major event the student body participates in is the annual sports festival, an elaborate event for which each class building spends months in preparation, and includes competitions not only in athletics but also parade and audience displays.

In recent years, Triam Udom Suksa students have also produced science projects competing on the international level, winning awards from the [[Intel International Science and Engineering Fair]] in 2004, 2006 and 2007.
