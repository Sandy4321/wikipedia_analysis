'''Mandaeans''' ({{lang-mid|<U+05DE><U+05E0><U+05D3><U+05E2><U+05E0><U+05D9><U+05D0>}} ''{{transl|mid|Manda<U+02BB>n<U+0101>ye}}'', {{lang-ar|<U+0627><U+0644><U+0635><U+0627><U+0628><U+0626><U+0629> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0645><U+0646><U+062F><U+0627><U+0626><U+064A><U+0648><U+0646>}} ''a<U+1E63>-<U+1E62>abi'a al-Mand<U+0101>'iy<U+016B>n'') are an ethnoreligious group indigenous to the alluvial plain of southern Mesopotamia and are followers of [[Mandaeism]], a [[Gnostic]] religion. The Mandaeans were originally native speakers of [[Mandaic]], a [[Semitic language]], which evolved from Eastern Middle [[Aramaic]], before switching to colloquial [[Iraqi Arabic]] and [[Modern Persian]]. Mandaic is mainly preserved as a [[liturgical language]]. During the last decade the indigenous Mandaic community of Iraq, which used to number 60-70,000 persons has collapsed due to Iraq War, with most of the community relocating to nearby Iran, Syria and Jordan and forming diaspora communities outside of the Middle East. The other indigenous community of Iranian Mandaeans has also been dwindling over religious persecution over the last decade.<ref name="saving"/>

== History ==
===Origin===
There are several indications on the ultimate origin of the Mandaeans. Early religious concepts and terminologies recur in the[[Dead Sea Scrolls]], and the [[River Jordan|Jordan]] have been the name of every baptismal water in Mandaeism.<ref Name=Rudolph5>{{Harvnb|Rudolph|1978|p=5}}</ref> This connection with early baptismal sects in the eastern Jordan region and the elements of Western Syrian in the Mandaean language attests to their western origin.<ref Name=Rudolph5/> The ultimate Jewish origin of the Mandaeans cannot be denied, despite the vehement polemics against the Jews in Mandaean literature in which[[Moses]] is a false prophet and the [[Adonai]] an evil God.<ref Name=Rudolph4>{{Harvnb|Rudolph|1978|p=4}}</ref> There are fewer indications on a relation between early Christians and Mandaeans which make the connection more problematic. Some scholars, including [[Kurt Rudolph]] connect the early Mandaeans with the [[Jewish Christian]] sect of the [[Nasoraeans]].<ref Name=Rudolph4/>
The emigration of early Mandaeans from the Jordan Valley took place the latest at the second century A.D. due to pressure from orthodox Jews.<ref Name=Rudolph5/> The migrants first went to [[Harran]] in upper Mesopotamia and entered the southern provinces of [[Mesopotamia]] during the third century A.D. It appears that [[Mani]] the founder of [[Manichaeism]] was partly influenced by the new comers. The Mandaeans had also hostile relations with the Byzantine church and the Babylonian Jews.<ref Name=Rudolph5/>

=== Early Persian periods ===
A number of ancient Aramaic texts dating back to the 2nd century AD were uncovered in [[Elymais]]. Although they appear quite similar to the Mandaean Ginza, it is doubtful whether the inhabitants of Elyamis were Mandaeans.<ref Name=Buckley4>{{Harvnb|Buckley|2002|p=4}}</ref> Under [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and early [[Sassanian Empire|Sasanian]] rule, foreign religions were tolerated and Mandaeanism enjoyed royal protection. The situation changed by the ascension of [[Bahram I]] in 273 who under the influence of the zealous [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] high priest [[Kartir]] persecuted all non-Zoroastrian religions. It is thought that this persecution encouraged the consolidation of Mandaean religious literature.<ref Name=Buckley4/>
The persecutions instigated by Kartir seems to temporarily erase Mandaeans from recorded history. Traces of their presence can still however be found in the so-called Mandaean magical bowls and lead strips which were produced from the 3rd to the 7th centuries.<ref Name=Buckley5>{{Harvnb|Buckley|2002|p=5}}</ref>

=== Islamic Caliphates ===
The Mandaeans re-appear at the beginning of the [[Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia]], when their "head of the people" Anush son of Danqa appears before Muslim authorities showing them a copy of the [[Ginza Rba|Ginza Rabba]], the Mandaean holy book, and proclaiming the chief Mandaean prophet to be [[John the Baptist]], who is also mentioned in the [[Quran]]. The connection the the Quranic [[Sabians]] enabled them acknowledgement as [[People of the Book]], a legal minority religion. They appear to have flourished during the early Islamic period as attested by the numerous expansion of Mandaic literature and canons. [[Tib, Mesopotamia|Tib]] near [[Wasit]] is particularly noted as an important scribal centre.<ref Name=Buckley5/> [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]]describes Tib as a town inhabited by [[Nabatean]] (i.e. Aramaic speaking) Sabians who consider themselves to be descendants of[[Seth]] son of [[Adam]].<ref Name=Buckley5/>
The status of the Mandaeans became an issue for the [[Abbasid]] [[al-Qahir Billah]]. To avoid further investigation by the authorities, the Mandaeans paid a bribe of 50,000 [[Islamic gold dinar|dinars]] and were left. It appears that the Mandaeans were even exempt from paying the [[Jizya]] imposed upon non-Muslims.<ref Name=Buckley5/>

=== Late Persian and Ottoman periods ===
Early contact with Europeans came about in the mid 16th century when Portuguese missionarries encountered Mandaeans in Southern Iraq and designated them mistakingly as "Christians of St. John". In the next centuries Europeans became more acquainted with the Mandaeans and their religion.<ref Name=Buckley5/>
 
The Mandaeans suffered persecution under the [[Qajar]] rule in the 1780s. The dwideling community was threatined with complete anhililation when a [[Cholera]] epidemic broke out in [[Shushtar]] in which half of its inhabitants died. The entire Manaean priesthood perished and Mandeism was restored due to the efforts of few learned men such as [[Yahia Bihram]].<ref Name=Buckley6>{{Harvnb|Buckley|2002|p=6}}</ref> Another danger threatened the community in 1870 when the local governor of Shushtar massacred the Mandaeans against the will of the Shah.<ref Name=Buckley6/> As a result of these events the Mandaeans retired to the more inaccessable [[Central Marshes]] of Iraq.

=== Modern Iraq and Iran ===
Following the First World War, the Mandaeans were still largely living in rural areas in the lower parts of the newly-found[[Kingdom of Iraq]] and Iran. Due to the rise of Arab nationalism they were [[Arabisation|arabised]] at an accelerated rate especially during the 1950s and 60s.<ref Name=MHRG5>{{Harvnb|Mandaean Human Rights Group|2008|p=5}}</ref>  The Mandaeans were also forced to abandon certain mandates such as the cutting of hair and forced military service which are strictly prohibited in Madaeanism.<ref Name=MHRG5/>

The [[2003 Iraq War]] brough more troubles to the Mandaeans as the security situation deteriorated. Many members of the Mandaean community who were known as goldsmiths were targeted by criminal gangs for ransoms. The rise of [[Islamic Extremism ]] forced thousands to flee the country after they were given the choice of conversion or death.<ref name=Zurutuza>{{cite news |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=106580 | title=The Ancient Wither in New Iraq | date=29 Januari 2012 | agency=IPS |accessdate=June 05, 2012 | author=Zurutuza, Karlos}}</ref>

It is estimated that around 90% of Iraqi Mandaeans were either killed or have fled after the American-led invasion.<ref name=Zurutuza/>

The Mandaeans of Iran lived chiefly in [[Ahvaz]] but have moved as a result of the [[Iraq-Iran War]] to other cities such as[[Tehran]], [[Karaj]] and [[Shiraz]]. The Mandaeans who were traditionally considered as [[People of the Book]] lost this status after [[Islamic Revolution in Iran|Islamic Revolution]]. Local authorities are known to encourage harassment and persecution of the Mandaeans.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cultureofiran.com/mandaean.html | title=Mandaean Religion in Iran |publisher=Encyclopedia Iranica | accessdate=June 05, 2012 | author=Buckley, Jorunn Jacobsen}}</ref>

===Mandaeans in Iraq===
{{See|Iraqi minorities#Mandaeans}}
The pre-Iraq War Iraqi Mandaean community was centered around Baghdad.<ref name="exodus" >{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/world/europe/09iht-mandeans.4.5202220.html?pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times |first=Ivar | last=Ekman | date=April 9, 2007 | accessdate=May 12, 2010 | title=An exodus to Sweden from Iraq for ethnic Mandaeans}}</ref>  Mandaean emigration from Iraq began during Saddam Hussein's rule, but accelerated greatly after the American invasion and subsequent occupation.<ref name="exodus" />  Since the invasion Mandaeans, like other Iraqi ethno-religious minorities (such as Assyrians, Armenians, Yazidi, Roma and Shabaks), have been subjected to violence, including murders, kidnappings, rapes, evictions, and forced conversions.<ref name="exodus" /><ref name="wp">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/09/AR2007020901687_2.html | work=The Washington Post |title=Survival of Ancient Faith Threatened by Fighting in Iraq | first=Chris | last=Newmarker | date=February 10, 2007 |accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref>  Mandaeans, like many other Iraqis, have also been targeted for kidnapping since many worked as goldsmiths.<ref name="exodus" /> Mandaeism is pacifistic and forbids its adherents from carrying weapons,<ref name="exodus" /><ref name="lupieri">Lupieri (2002), p. 91.</ref>

Many Iraqi Mandaeans have fled the country in the face of this violence, and the Mandaean community in Iraq faces extinction.<ref name="bbc0307">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6412453.stm Iraq's Mandaeans 'face extinction'], Angus Crawford, BBC, March 4, 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.genocidewatch.org/news/IraqGenocideWatchMandaeansofIraq.htm Genocide Watch: Mandaeans of Iraq]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref> Out of the over 60,000 Mandaeans in Iraq in the early 1990s, only about 5,000 to 7,000 remain there; as of early 2007, over 80% of Iraqi Mandaeans were refugees in Syria and Jordan as a result of the [[Iraq War]]. 

===Iranian Mandaeans===
The number of Iranian Mandaeans is a matter of dispute. In 2009, there were an estimated 5,000 and 10,000 Mandaeans in Iran, according to the Assosiated Press.<ref name="saving" /> Whereas Alarabiya has put the number of Iranian Mandaeans as high as 60,000 in 2011.<ref name=alarabiya0612/>

Until the Iranian Revolution, Mandaeans had mainly been concentrated in the Khuzestan province,<ref name=alarabiya0612>{{cite web|author=<!--[if IE 6]> <![endif]--> |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/12/06/181123.html |title=Iran Mandaeans in exile following persecution |publisher=Alarabiya.net |date=2011-12-06 |accessdate=2011-12-17}}</ref> where the community used to exist by side with the local Arab population.<ref name=alarabiya0612/> They had mainly been practising the profession of goldsmith, passing it from generation to generation.<ref name=alarabiya0612/> Since the fall of the shah, its members faced increased religious discrimination, and many sought a new home in Europe and the Americas. 

In Iran the ''[[Gozinesh]]'' Law (passed in 1985) has the effect of prohibiting Mandaeans from fully participating in civil life. This law and other ''gozinesh'' provisions make access to employment, education, and a range of other areas conditional upon a rigorous ideological screening, the principal prerequisite for which is devotion to the tenets of Islam.<ref>[http://www.roozonline.com/english/archives/2007/06/005324.php Ideological Screening (ROOZ :: English)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> These laws are regularly applied to discriminate against religious and ethnic groups that are not officially recognized, such as the Mandaeans, [[Ahl-e Haq]], and [[Baha'i]].<ref>[http://www.amnestyusa.org/annualreport.php?id=ar&yr=2005&c=IRN Annual Report for Iran], 2005, [[Amnesty International]].</ref>

In 2002 the US State Department granted Iranian Mandaeans protective refugee status; since then roughly 1,000 have emigrated to the US,<ref name="saving" /> now residing in cities such as [[San Antonio, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Updated 33 minutes ago 12/17/2011 8:29:41 AM +00:00|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31680885/ns/us_news-faith/t/ancient-sect-fights-keep-culture-alive-us/ |title=Ancient sect fights to stay alive in U.S. - US news - Faith - msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2009-01-07 |accessdate=2011-12-17}}</ref> On the other hand, the Mandaean community in Iran has increased over the last decade, due to the exodus of the main Mandaean community from Iraq, which used to be 60,000-70,000 strong.

===Other countries in the Middle East===

===Diaspora===
There are small Mandaean diaspora populations in Sweden (c. 5,000), Australia (c. 3,500 as of 2006), the USA (c. 1,500), the UK (c. 1,000), and Canada.<ref name="bbc0307" /><ref name="newmarker">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/09/AR2007020901687_pf.html Survival of Ancient Faith Threatened by Fighting in Iraq], Chris Newmarker, Associated Press.

The contemporary status of the Mandaeans has prompted a number of American intellectuals and civil rights activists to call upon the U.S. government to extend refugee status to the community.  In 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran an [[op-ed]] piece in which Swarthmore professor [[Nathaniel Deutsch]] called for the Bush administration to take immediate action to preserve the community:

{{Quote|The United States didn<U+2019>t set out to eradicate the Mandeans, one of the oldest, smallest and least understood of the many minorities in Iraq. This extinction in the making has simply been another unfortunate and entirely [[unintended consequence]] of our invasion of Iraq<U+2014>though that will be of little comfort to the Mandeans, whose 2,000-year-old culture is in grave danger of disappearing from the face of the earth. . . . . When American forces invaded in 2003, there were probably 60,000 Mandeans in Iraq; today, fewer than 5,000 remain. . . . Of the mere 500 Iraqi refugees who were allowed into the United States from April 2003 to April 2007, only a few were Mandeans. And despite the Bush administration<U+2019>s commitment to let in 7,000 refugees in the fiscal year that ended [September 30, 2007], fewer than 2,000, including just three Iraqi Mandean families, entered the country.  If all Iraqi Mandeans are granted privileged status and allowed to enter the United States in significant numbers, it may just be enough to save them and their ancient culture from destruction. If not, after 2,000 years of history, of persecution and tenacious survival, the last Gnostics will finally disappear, victims of an extinction inadvertently set into motion by our nation<U+2019>s negligence in Iraq.|Nathaniel Deutsch, professor of religion, [[Swarthmore College]]|October 7, 2007<ref name="DEUTSCH">[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/opinion/06deutsch.html "Save the Gnostics"] by Nathaniel Deutsch, October 6, 2007, ''New York Times.''</ref>}}

Iraqi Mandaeans were given refugee status by the US State Department in 2007.  Since then around 1200 have entered the US.<ref name="saving" /> Many Mandaeans have began returning to Iraq during the past two years, as the circumstances in Iraq have improved.
