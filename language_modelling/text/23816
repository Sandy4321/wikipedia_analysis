'''''Seeing a Large Cat''''' is the ninth mystery novel in the [[Amelia Peabody]] mystery series by [[Elizabeth Peters]]. The story takes place during the season of 1903-1904.

==Plot summary==
{{spoiler}}
The book opens at Amelia's favorite hotel, Shepheard's in [[Cairo]], where her family reunites after a summer in various locations. [[Ramses Emerson|Ramses]] and David have been living in Egypt for six months, and [[Nefret Emerson|Nefret]] has been studying anatomy at the [[University of Edinburgh]].

The Emersons receive a dire warning about staying away from an undiscovered tomb, which of course inspires them to hunt all the harder for it. Meanwhile, a silly American debutante insists she needs protection from a stalker (selecting Ramses for the job), and a mummy swathed in modern clothing begins to lend verisimilitude to her otherwise unconvincing narrative.

We also reunite with old friends, as Donald and Enid Fraser from ''[[Lion in the Valley]]'' are in Cairo, accompanied by a woman who claims to have communicated with an ancient Egyptian princess and unwittingly triggered Donald's obsession with finding the princess' tomb.

This volume marks the passing of the cat Bastet and the first whiskey Ramses is permitted to imbibe (although the two events are not directly related).
