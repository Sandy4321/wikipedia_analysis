==Early life==
Evans grew up in [[South Boston]]. His mother died when he was 13 and his father raised Evans and his four brothers alone. When Evans was 25, his father died and Evans took on a paternal role towards his teenage brothers, one of whom, [[William D. Evans (police commissioner)|William D. Evans]], is the current Boston Police Commissioner.<ref name="Officers Impressed by Evans' Fairness">{{cite news|last=Cullen|first=Kevin|title=Officers Impressed by Evans' Fairness|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=April 14, 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Andersen|first=Travis|title=William Evans to be named Boston police commissioner|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2014/01/07/william-evans-named-boston-police-commissioner/nyWecTcul6IN1zIBznP5TM/story.html|accessdate=January 9, 2014|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=January 7, 2014}}</ref>

After graduating from high school, Evans enlisted in the [[United States Marines Corps]]. He served eleven months in Vietnam during the [[Vietnam War]] and fought in the [[Battle of Khe Sanh]].<ref name="Officers Impressed by Evans' Fairness" />

In 1969, Evans returned home. He enrolled in [[Boston College]], found a job with the [[United States Postal Service]], and planned on having a career in business. However, a cousin told him about the police exam and Evans signed up without giving it much thought.<ref name="Officers Impressed by Evans' Fairness" />

==Early career==
Evans joined the Boston Police Department in 1970 as a street patrol officer.<ref name="Boston police commissioner accepts job in London">{{cite news|last=O'Neill|first=Robert|title=Boston police commissioner accepts job in London|url=http://www.boston.com/news/daily/08/evans.htm|accessdate=January 9, 2014|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=September 8, 2003}}</ref> He was a member of the same class as [[William Bratton]].<ref name="Bratton's Confident">{{cite news|last=Mancusi|first=Peter|title=Bratton's Confident|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=September 19, 1980}}</ref> In 1974, Evans graduated from [[Boston State College]] with a bachelor's degree in political science.<ref name="Top Cop in Boston">{{cite news|title=Top Cop in Boston: The Final Four|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=February 4, 1994}}</ref>

After five years as a patrolman in [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]], Evans was promoted to sergeant. He served as a day supervisor in South Boston during the height of the [[Boston busing crisis]].<ref name="Officers Impressed by Evans' Fairness" />

In 1978, Evans earned a law degree from [[Suffolk University Law School]].<ref name="Top Cop in Boston" /> That same year he was promoted to Lieutenant, where he ran the night shift in [[Jamaica Plain]] and later in [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]].<ref name="Officers Impressed by Evans' Fairness" /> He also worked in the Field Services bureau, where he was credited with developing the data that Commissioner Joseph M. Jordan's 1983 patrol plan was based on.<ref name="High-Level Appointment in Wind for Hub Police">{{cite news|title=High-Level Appointment in Wind for Hub Police|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=March 20, 1986|author=Steven Marantz|author2=Kevin Cullen}}</ref>

In 1980 he was named Deputy Superintendent. He was the commander of District D, which consisted of the [[South End, Boston|South End]], [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]], and [[Allston<U+2013>Brighton]]. In 1985 he was a finalist for the position of Police Commissioner, however mayor [[Raymond Flynn]] instead chose [[Francis Roache]], the head of the Community Disorders Unit and a longtime friend. In 1986 he was placed in charge of the Field Services bureau, where he oversaw all of the department's uniformed officers and half of its detectives. He was tasked with implementing a new Evan patrol plan, which included reopening the district stations in Brighton and [[East Boston]]. Although he was not a member of Roache's inner circle, he was promoted because the Flynn administration admired his ability as an administrator and because he had a reputation among the officers as being fair and straightforward. After the abolishment of the superintendent-in-chief position, Evans became the administrator of day-to-day operations and the most influential commander in the department.<ref name="Officers Impressed by Evans' Fairness" />

In February 1992, Evans was transferred to the Bureau of Investigative Services, where he was responsible for detectives and investigations. When Bratton became Police Commissioner in July 1993, Evans succeeded him as Superintendent-in-Chief.<ref name="Top Cop in Boston" />

==Police Commissioner==
When Bratton was sworn in as Commissioner of the [[New York City Police Department]], Evans became acting Commissioner.<ref>{{cite news|title=Evans named acting police head|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=January 11, 1994}}</ref> He was one of twenty-five candidates considered for the permanent by a search committee headed by former [[United States Associate Attorney General|Associate Attorney General]] and [[United States Attorney|US Attorney]] [[Wayne Budd]] and, along with State Police Lt. Col. [[Kathleen O'Toole]], Boston Police Superintendent Joseph Carter, and former Chicago police commander Dennis Nowicki, was one of the four finalists presented to Mayor [[Thomas Menino]]. Menino selected Evans because he believed Evans' knowledge of the department would facilitate change without disrupting operations. Evans was sworn in on February 14, 1994.<ref>{{cite news|last=Black|first=Chris|title=Evans reportedly choice for top police post|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=February 14, 1994}}</ref>

At the time of Evans' appointment, the department was suffering from instability after Bratton's tumultuous five-month reign as commissioner and crime rates were declining from historic peaks.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cafasso|first=Ed|title=Evans will be Hub's top cop|newspaper=Boston Herald|date=February 14, 1994}}</ref>

During his tenure as Police Commissioner, Evans built coalitions with other community organizations, academics, businesses, law-enforcement agencies to develop programs, one example being a program that provided summer jobs for at-risk city youth. While Evans was Commissioner, Boston saw crime rates drop in most categories, including a dramatic drop in gang-related violence and homicides. This period of peace was known as the "Boston Miracle". In 2002 the city experienced a 31-year low in violent crime.<ref name="Boston police commissioner accepts job in London" />

==Post-BPD career==
In 2003, Evans left the department to become director of the Police Standards Unit of Britain's [[Home Office]], which assessed the performance of British police forces and to helped them improve.<ref name="Boston police commissioner accepts job in London" /> He remained with the Home Office until 2007.<ref name="Suffolk Downs" />

After returning to the United States, Evans worked as a security consultant. In 2009 he was hired by Suffolk Downs to conduct an examination of [[Caesars Entertainment Corporation|Harrah's Entertainment]], the company the track chose to partner with in its bid for a resort casino. In January 2012, Evans was hired by the owners of Suffolk Downs to run the track's security operations while they attempt to win a state license to operate a casino.<ref name="Suffolk Downs">{{cite news|last=Ellement|first=John R.|title=Paul F.
