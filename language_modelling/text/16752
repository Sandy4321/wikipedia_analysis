'''HMS ''Courageous''''' was the [[lead ship]] of the {{sclass|Courageous|battlecruiser|0}} "large [[light cruiser]]s" built for the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War I]]. Nominally designed to support the [[First Sea Lord]] of the [[Admiralty]], [[Admiral]] Sir [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John Fisher]]'s [[Baltic Project]], they were very lightly armoured and armed with only a few heavy guns. ''Courageous'' was completed in late 1916 and spent the war patrolling the [[North Sea]]. She participated in the [[Second Battle of Heligoland Bight]] in November 1917 and was present when the German [[High Seas Fleet]] surrendered a year later.

''Courageous'' was [[paid off]] after the end of the war, but was rebuilt as an [[aircraft carrier]] during the mid-1920s. Her design was improved over her [[sister ship|half-sister]] {{HMS|Furious|47|2}} as it reflected the knowledge gained from the latter's experiences and she could carry 30% percent more aircraft on approximately the same tonnage. After recommissioning she spent most of her career operating off the [[British Isles]]. She briefly became a training carrier right before [[World War II]], but reverted to her normal role a few months before the start of the war. ''Courageous'' was torpedoed and sunk in the opening weeks of the war, going down with more than 500 of her crew.
  
==Genesis==
[[Image:HMS Courageous WWI.jpg|thumb|left|HMS ''Courageous'' shortly after completion in 1916]]
Admiral Fisher wanted more battlecruisers built during World War I, but was prevented from doing so by a wartime restriction that banned all construction of ships larger than a light cruiser. He got around this prohibition by only giving the ships a minimal amount of armor, roughly equal to that of a light cruiser. If this restriction had not been in force he would have ordered an improved version of the preceeding {{Sclass|Renown|battlecruiser}}s.<ref name=b03>Burt 1986, p. 303</ref> He justified their existence by claiming he needed fast, shallow-draught ships for his Baltic Project, a plan to invade Germany via its Baltic coast, although he also discussed their use in the more traditional battlecruiser roles of scouting for the battlefleet and hunting down enemy raiders.<ref>Roberts, pp. 50<U+2013>51</ref>

''Courageous'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|786|ft|9|in|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|81|ft|m|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|25|ft|10|in|m|1}} at deep load. She displaced {{convert|19180|LT|t|lk=on}} at load and {{convert|22560|LT|t|0}} at deep load.<ref name=r65>Roberts, pp. 64<U+2013>65</ref> ''Courageous'' and her [[sister ship|sisters]] were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared [[steam turbine]]s. To save time the installation used in the light cruiser {{HMS|Champion|1915|2}}, the first cruiser in the RN with geared turbines, was simply doubled. The [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] turbines were powered by eighteen [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] small-tube [[water-tube boiler|boilers]]. They were designed to produce a total of {{convert|90000|shp|lk=in|0}} at a working pressure of {{convert|235|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref>Roberts, pp. 71, 76, 79</ref>

''Courageous'' was designed to normally carry {{convert|750|LT|t|0}} of [[fuel oil]], but could carry a maximum of {{convert|3160|LT|t|0}}. At full capacity, she could steam for an estimated {{convert|6000|nmi|-1}} at a speed of {{convert|20|knots}}.<ref name=b06>Burt 1986, p. 306</ref>

''Courageous'' carried four [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|BL 15-inch Mark I]] guns in two twin hydraulically powered Mark I* [[gun turret]]s, one each fore ('A') and aft ('Y'). Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen [[BL 4 inch Mk IX naval gun|BL 4-inch Mark IX guns]] mounted in six manually powered triple T.I. Mark I mounts.<ref name=b06/> These mounts had the three [[Breech-loading weapon|breeches]] too close together and the 23 loaders tended to interfere with each other. This rather negated the mount's intended purpose to provide a high rate of fire against [[torpedo boat]]s and other smaller craft.<ref>Burt 1983, p. 294</ref> A pair of [[QF 3 inch 20 cwt]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns were fitted abreast the [[mainmast]] on ''Courageous''. She mounted two submerged [[torpedo tube|tubes]] for [[British 21 inch torpedo|21-inch torpedoes]] and 10 torpedoes were carried.<ref name=b06/>

==World War I==
Her [[keel]] was laid down on 28 March 1915, the ship was launched on 5 February 1916, and ''Courageous'' was completed on 4 November 1916. During her [[sea trial]]s later that month, she sustained structural damage while running at full speed in a rough head sea. The forecastle deck was deeply buckled in three places between the breakwater and the forward turret.<ref>Burt 1986, p. 309</ref> In addition the side plating was visibly buckled between the forecastle and upper decks. Water had entered the submerged torpedo room and rivets had sheared in the [[angle iron]] securing the deck armour in place.<ref>Burt 1986, pp. 309, 313</ref> The exact cause is uncertain, but ''Courageous'' was stiffened with {{convert|130|LT|t|0}} of steel in response.<ref>Roberts, p. 54</ref> Upon commissioning, ''Courageous'' served with the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron of the [[Grand Fleet]]. With her sister ''Glorious'' she later reconstituted the [[1st Cruiser Squadron]] (CS) of which ''Courageous'' served as [[flagship]].<ref name=p21>Parkes, p. 621</ref> She cost <U+00A3>2,038,225 to build (costs to 23 Nov 1916).<ref>Burt 1986, p. 307</ref>

The ship was temporarily fitted as a minelayer in April 1917 by the addition of mine rails on her quarterdeck that could hold over 200 [[Naval mine|mine]]s, but never actually laid any mines. In mid-1917 ''Courageous'' received a dozen torpedo tubes in pairs: one mount on each side of the mainmast on the upper deck and two mounts on each side of the rear turret on the quarterdeck.<ref>McBride, p. 109</ref><ref name=b14>Burt 1986, p. 314</ref>

On 16 October 1917 the Admiralty received word of German ship movements, possibly indicating some sort of raid. [[Admiral]] [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Beatty]], commander of the [[Grand Fleet]] ordered most of his light cruisers and destroyers to sea in an effort to locate the enemy ships. ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' were not initially ordered to sea, but were sent to reinforce the 2nd LCS patrolling the central part of the [[North Sea]] later that day.<ref>Newbolt, pp. 150<U+2013>51</ref> Two German {{sclass|Brummer|cruiser|0}} [[light cruiser]]s managed to slip through the gaps in the British patrols and destroyed a convoy bound for Norway during the morning of 17 October, but no word was received of the engagement until that afternoon. The 1st CS was ordered to attempt to intercept the German ships, but they proved to be faster than hoped and the British ships were unsuccessful.<ref>Newbolt, pp. 156<U+2013>57</ref>  

===Second Battle of Heligoland Bight===
{{Main|Second Battle of Heligoland Bight}}
Over the course of 1917 the Admiralty was becoming more concerned about German efforts to sweep paths through the British-laid minefields intended to restrict the actions of the [[High Seas Fleet]] and German [[submarine]]s. A preliminary raid on German minesweeping forces on 31 October by light forces destroyed ten small ships and the Admiralty decided on a larger operation to destroy the [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s and their escorting light cruisers. Based on intelligence reports, the Admiralty decided on 17 November 1917 to allocate two light cruiser squadrons, the 1st CS covered by the reinforced [[1st Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Battlecruiser Squadron]] and, more distantly, the [[1st Battle Squadron]] of [[battleship]]s to the operation.<ref>Newbolt, pp. 164<U+2013>65</ref>

The German ships<U+2014>four light cruisers of II Scouting Force, eight destroyers, three divisions of minesweepers, eight sperrbrechers (cork-filled trawlers) and two trawlers to mark the swept route<U+2014>were spotted at 7:30 a.m. ''Courageous'' and the light cruiser {{HMS|Cardiff|D58|2}} opened fire with their forward guns seven minutes later. The Germans responded by laying a [[smoke screen]], complicating targeting for the British ships. The British continued in pursuit, but lost track of most of the smaller ships in the smoke and concentrated fire on the light cruisers as opportunity permitted. One fifteen-inch hit was made on a gun shield of {{SMS|Pillau}}, but did not affect her speed. At 9:30 the 1st CS reached their absolute limit of advance and withdrew south, playing no further role in the battle.<ref>McBride, pp. 110<U+2013>12</ref>

''Courageous'' fired ninety-two fifteen-inch shells and 180 four-inch shells during the battle.<ref>Campbell, p. 67</ref> ''Courageous'' was only damaged by her own [[muzzle blast]].<ref>McBride, p. 115</ref> The ship's mine fittings were removed after the battle. The rest of the war was spent intermittently patrolling the North Sea. In 1918, short take-off platforms were fitted for a [[Sopwith Camel]] and a [[Sopwith 1<U+00BD> Strutter]] on both {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on}} turrets.<ref>Campbell, p. 66</ref> ''Courageous'' was present at the surrender of the German High Seas fleet on 21 November 1918.<ref name=b14/> ''Courageous'' was placed in reserve at [[Rosyth]] on 1 February 1919 before being assigned to the Gunnery School at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] the following year as a turret drill ship. She became flagship of the Rear-Admiral Commanding the Reserve at Devonport in March 1920.<ref>Burt 1986, p. 315</ref>

==Conversion==
The [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922 severely limited the amount of capital ship tonnage and the Royal Navy was forced to scrap many of its older battleships and battlecruisers. However up to {{convert|66000|LT|t|0}} of existing ships could be converted into [[aircraft carrier]]s, for which the ''Courageous''-class ships' combination of a large hull and high speed made them an ideal candidate. ''Courageous'' was converted to an aircraft carrier at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] starting on 29 June 1924, and she was re-commissioned in May 1928.<ref>Burt 1993, pp. 273, 285</ref> 

Her design was based on that of [[HMS Furious|HMS ''Furious]] with several improvements based on experience since that ship was originally designed. All superstructure, guns, torpedo tubes, and fittings down to the main deck were removed. A two-storied hangar, each level {{convert|16|ft|1}} high and {{convert|550|ft|m|1}} long, was built on top of the remaining hull; the upper hangar level opened on to a short 'flying-off deck', below and forward of the main flight deck. Two slightly larger semi-cruciform {{convert|46|x|48|ft|m|adj=on|1}} lifts were installed fore and aft in the flight deck. An [[Glossary of nautical_terms#I|island]] with the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]], flying control station and [[funnel]] was added on the starboard side, since earlier fears that an island created a dangerous amount of turbulence had been disproven. By 1939 the ship could carry {{convert|34500|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol.<ref>Friedman, pp. 103, 105<U+2013>06</ref>

''Courageous'' received a dual-purpose armament of sixteen [[QF 4.7 inch Mk VIII naval gun|QF 4.7-inch Mark VIII]] guns in single HA Mark XII mounts. One mount was on each side of the lower flight deck and a pair were on the quarterdeck. The remaining twelve mounts were distributed along the sides of the ship.<ref>Burt 1993, pp. 274<U+2013>78</ref> During refits in the mid-1930s ''Courageous'' received three quadruple {{convert|40|mm|in|1|adj=on}} [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|2-pounder ''pom-pom'']] Mark VII mounts - one on each side of the flying-off deck, forward of the 4.7-inch guns, and one behind the island on the flight deck (two of these were transferred from the battleship {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|05|2}}). She also received four water-cooled [[Vickers .50 machine gun|.50-calibre Mark III]] [[machine gun]]s in a single quadruple mounting.<ref>Burt 1993, pp. 165, 278, 281</ref>

Her conversion cost [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]2,025,800 (approximately <U+00A3>82 million in 2005 currency).<ref>{{ cite web |url  = http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2006/rp06-009.pdf |format=PDF| title = Inflation: The value of the pound 1750-2005 | work = House of Commons Library research paper|date=13 February 2006 | accessdate=12 April 2008}}</ref> Her fifteen-inch turrets were placed into storage and later reused during [[World War II]] for {{HMS|Vanguard|1944|6}}, the Royal Navy's last battleship.<ref>Parkes, p. 647</ref> 

''Courageous'' was recommissioned on 21 February 1928 and assigned to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]], in which she served from May 1928 to June 1930. She was relieved by ''Glorious'' and refitted from June to August 1930. She was assigned to the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic]] and [[Home Fleet]]s from 12 August 1930 to December 1938, aside from a temporary attachment to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1936. In the early 1930s, traverse arresting gear was installed and she received two hydraulic accelerators ([[aircraft catapult]]s) on the upper flight deck before March 1934. ''Courageous'' was refitted again between October 1935 and June 1936 with her ''pom-pom'' mounts. She was present at the Coronation [[Fleet Review]] at [[Spithead]] on 20 May 1937 for King [[George VI]]. She became a training carrier in December 1938 when {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} joined the Home Fleet. She was relieved of that duty by her [[sister ship|half-sister]] ''Furious'' in May 1939. ''Courageous'' participated in the [[Isle of Portland|Portland]] Fleet Review on 9 August 1939.<ref name=b15>Burt 1993, pp. 281, 285</ref>

===Air group===
''Courageous'' could carry up to 48 aircraft; when first recommissioned, she carried [[Fairey Flycatcher]] fighters, [[Blackburn Dart]] and [[Blackburn Ripon]] [[torpedo bomber]]s, and [[Fairey IIIF]] reconnaissance planes. From 1933 to the end of 1938 ''Courageous'' carried [[800 Naval Air Squadron|800 Squadron]] which flew a mixture of nine [[Hawker Nimrod]] and three [[Hawker Osprey]] fighters for this entire period.<ref>Sturtivant, pp. 155, 157<U+2013>58</ref> [[810 Naval Air Squadron|810]], [[820 Naval Air Squadron|820]] and [[821 Naval Air Squadron|821 Squadrons]] were embarked for reconnaissance and anti-ship attack missions. They flew the [[Blackburn Baffin]], the [[Blackburn Shark]] and the [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[torpedo bomber]]s and as well as [[Fairey Seal]] reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Sturtivant, pp. 197, 200, 243, 247, 250, 252</ref> As a deck landing training carrier in early 1939 ''Courageous'' embarked [[801 Naval Air Squadron|801]] and [[811 Naval Air Squadron|811 Squadrons]], flying [[Blackburn Skua]] and [[Gloster Sea Gladiator]] fighters and Swordfish torpedo bombers respectively.<ref>Sturtivant, pp. 161, 164<U+2013>65, 203<U+2013>04</ref>

==World War II and sinking==
[[Image:HMS Courageous sinking.jpg|thumb|left|''Courageous'' sinking after being torpedoed by ''U-29'']]

''Courageous'' served with the [[Home Fleet]] at the start of World War II. In the early days of the war, [[Hunter-killer armored-vehicle team|hunter-killer]] groups were formed around the fleet aircraft carriers to find and destroy U-boats. On 17 September 1939 she was on an [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] patrol off the coast of [[Ireland]]. Two of her four escorting [[destroyer]]s had been sent to help a [[merchant ship]] under attack. During this time, ''Courageous'' was stalked for over two hours by {{Ship|German submarine|U-29|1936|2}}, commanded by ''Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant'' [[Otto Schuhart]]. Then ''Courageous'' turned into the wind to launch her aircraft. This manoeuvre put the ship right across the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] of ''U-29'', which then fired three [[torpedo]]es. Two of the torpedoes struck the ship on her [[Port (nautical)|port side]], knocking out all electrical power, and she [[Capsizing|capsized]] and sank in 20 minutes with the loss of 518 of her crew, including her captain.<ref>Burt 1993, pp. 286<U+2013>88</ref> When sunk ''Courageous'' had [[811 Naval Air Squadron|811]] and [[822 Naval Air Squadron|822 Squadrons]] of the [[Fleet Air Arm]] aboard. Each squadron was equipped with a dozen Fairey Swordfish.<ref>Brown, p. 12</ref> 

An earlier unsuccessful attack on {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} by {{Ship|German submarine|U-29|1936|2}} on 14 September<U+2014>and the sinking of ''Courageous'' three days later<U+2014>caused the Royal Navy to withdraw its fleet carriers from anti-submarine patrol. ''Courageous'' was the first British warship to be lost in the war; the civilian passenger liner {{SS|Athenia}} had been sunk two weeks earlier.<ref name=r>Rohwer, pp. 1<U+2013>3</ref>
