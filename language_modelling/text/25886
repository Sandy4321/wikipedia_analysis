The '''''Mahabharata''''' ([[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|Mah<U+0101>bh<U+0101>rata}}'' {{lang|sa|<U+092E><U+0939><U+093E><U+092D><U+093E><U+0930><U+0924>}}, {{IPA-sa|m<U+0259><U+0266>a<U+02D0><U+02C8>b<U+02B1>a<U+02D0>r<U+0259>t<U+032A><U+0259>|IPA}}) is one of the two major [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit]] [[Indian epic poetry|epic]]s of [[History of India|ancient India]], the other being the ''[[Ramayana]]''. The epic is part of ''[[Indian epic poetry|itihasa]]''.<ref name=encindlit>{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&pg=PA1755&dq=itihasa | title = The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj to Jyoti) | isbn = 9788126011940 | author1 = Datta | first1 = Amaresh | date = 2006-01-01}}</ref>

Besides its epic narrative of the [[Kurukshetra War]] and the fates of the [[Kaurava]]s and the [[Pandava]]s, the  ''Mahabharata'' contains much [[Hindu philosophy|philosophical]] and devotional material, such as  a discussion of the four "goals of life" or ''[[purusharthas]]'' (12.161). The latter are enumerated as ''[[dharma]]'' (right action), ''[[artha]]'' (purpose), ''[[kama (Purusharthas)|kama]]'' (pleasure), and ''[[moksha]]'' (liberation).
Among the principal works and stories that are a part of the ''Mahabharata'' are the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the story of [[Damayanti]], an abbreviated version of the Ramayana, and the  [[Rishyasringa]], often considered as works in their own right.

Traditionally, the authorship of the ''Mahabharata'' is attributed to [[Vyasa]]. There have been many attempts to unravel its historical growth and compositional layers.  The oldest preserved parts of the text are not thought to be appreciably older than around 400 BCE, though the origins of the story probably fall between the 8th and 9th centuries BCE.<ref name=Brockington>Brockington (1998, p. 26)</ref> The text probably reached its final form by the early [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]] (ca. fourth century CE).<ref>Van Buitenen; The Mahabharata <U+2013> 1; The Book of the Beginning. Introduction (Authorship and Date)</ref> The title may be translated as "the great tale of the Bh<U+0101>rata dynasty".  According to the ''Mahabharata'' itself, the tale is extended from a shorter version of 24,000 verses called simply ''Bh<U+0101>rata''.<ref>''bh<U+0101>rata'' means the progeny of ''[[Bharata (emperor)|Bharata]]'', the  legendary king who is claimed to have founded the ''[[Bh<U+0101>ratavarsha]]'' kingdom.</ref>

The Mahabharata is the longest Sanskrit epic. Its longest version consists of over 100,000 ''[[shloka]]'' or over 200,000 individual verse lines (each shloka is a couplet), and long prose passages. About 1.8 million words in total, the Mahabharata is roughly ten times the length of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' combined, or about four times the length of the Ramayana.<ref>[[Howard Spodek|Spodek, Howard]].

==Textual history and structure==
[[File:Angkor Wat 006.JPG|thumb|Depiction at [[Angkor Wat]] of [[Vyasa]] narrating the Mahabharata to [[Ganesha]], his scribe.]]
The epic is traditionally ascribed to [[Vyasa]], who is also a major character in the epic. The first section of the ''Mahabharata'' states that it was [[Ganesha]] who, at the request of Vyasa, wrote down the text to Vyasa's dictation. Ganesha is said to have agreed to write it only on condition that Vyasa never pause in his recitation. Vyasa agreed, provided Ganesha took the time to understand what was said before writing it down.

The epic employs the [[story within a story]] structure, otherwise known as frametales, popular in many Indian religious and secular works. It is recited to the King [[Janamejaya]] who is the great-grandson of [[Arjuna]], by [[Vaisampayana]], a disciple of Vyasa. The recitation of Vaisampayana to Janamejaya is then recited again by a professional storyteller named [[Ugrasrava Sauti]], many years later, to an assemblage of sages performing the 12 year long sacrifice for King Saunaka Kulapati in the [[Naimisha Forest|Naimisha forest]].

''Jaya'', the core of Mah<U+0101>bh<U+0101>rata is structured in the form of a dialogue between Kuru king Dhritarashtra and [[Sanjaya]], his advisor and chariot driver. Sanjaya narrates each incident of the Kurukshetra War, fought in 18 days, as and when it happened. Dhritar<U+0101>shtra sometimes asks questions and doubts and sometimes laments, knowing about the destruction caused by the war, to his sons, friends and kinsmen. He also feels guilty, due to his own role, that led to this war, destructive to the entire Indian subcontinent.

In the beginning, Sanjaya gives a description of the various continents of the Earth, the other planets, and focuses on the Indian Subcontinent and gives an elaborate list of hundreds of kingdoms, tribes, provinces, cities, towns, villages, rivers, mountains, forests, etc. of the (ancient) Indian Subcontinent (Bh<U+0101>rata Varsha). He also explains about the military formations adopted by each side on each day, the death of each hero and the details of each war-racings. Some 18 chapters of Vyasa's Jaya constitutes the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the sacred text of the [[Hindus]]. Thus, this work of Vyasa, called Jaya deals with diverse subjects like geography, history, warfare, religion and morality. According to Mahabharata itself, Vaisampayana's ''Bharata'' expanded on the story, with Vyasa's Jaya embedded within it. Ugrasrava eventually composed the final Mahabharata, with both Vyasa's Jaya and Vaisampayana's Bharata embedded within the epic.

===Accretion and redaction===
Research on the ''Mahabharata'' has put an enormous effort into recognizing and dating various layers within the text. Some elements of the present ''Mahabharata'' can be traced back to Vedic times.<ref>[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=FYPOVdzZ2UIC&pg=PA452&dq=a+history+of+indian+literature+mahabharata+date&hl=en&ei=LebbTIesJIOycOuWycMG&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-thumbnail&resnum=1&ved=0CDgQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&q=a%20history%20of%20indian%20literature%20mahabharata%20date&f=false A History of Indian Literature, Volume 1 By Maurice Winternitz]</ref>  The background to the ''Mahabharata'' suggests the origin of the epic occurs at a time "after the very early [[Vedic period]]" and before "the first Indian 'empire' was to rise in the third century B.C.". That this is "a date not too far removed from the eighth or ninth century B.C."<ref name=Brockington/><ref name=vanB73>Buitenen (1973) pp. xxiv<U+2013>xxv</ref> is likely. It is generally agreed that "Unlike the Vedas, which have to be preserved letter-perfect, the epic was a popular work whose reciters would inevitably conform to changes in language and style,"<ref name=vanB73/> so the earliest ''surviving'' components of this dynamic text are believed to be no older than the earliest ''external'' references we have to the epic, which may include an allusion in [[P<U+0101><U+1E47>ini|Panini]]'s fourth century BCE grammar (''Asht<U+0101>dhy<U+0101>y<U+012B>'' 4:2:56).<ref name=Brockington>Brockington (1998) p. 26</ref><ref name=vanB73/> It is estimated that the Sanskrit text probably reached something of a "final form" by the early [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]] (about the 4th century CE).<ref name=vanB73 /> Vishnu Sukthankar, editor of the first great critical edition of the Mahabharata, commented: "It is useless to think of reconstructing a fluid text in a literally original shape, on the basis of an archetype and a ''stemma codicum''. What then is possible? Our objective can only be to reconstruct ''the oldest form of the text which it is possible to reach'' on the basis of the manuscript material available."<ref>Sukthankar (1933) "Prolegomena" p. lxxxvi. Emphasis is original.</ref> That manuscript evidence is somewhat late, given its material composition and the climate of India, but it is very extensive.

The ''Mahabharata'' itself (1.1.61) distinguishes a core portion of 24,000 verses, the ''Bharata'' proper, as opposed to additional secondary material, while the ''[[Grhya Sutras|Ashvalayana Grhyasutra]]'' (3.4.4) makes a similar distinction.  At least three redactions of the text are commonly recognized: ''Jaya'' (Victory) with 8,800 verses attributed to [[Vyasa]], ''Bharata'' with 24,000 verses as recited by [[Vaisampayana]], and finally the ''Mahabharata'' as recited by [[Ugrasrava Sauti]] with over 100,000 verses.<ref>Gupta & Ramachandran (1976), citing ''Mahabharata'', Critical Edition, I, 56, 33</ref><ref>SP Gupta and KS Ramachandran (1976), p.3-4, citing Vaidya (1967), p.11</ref> However, some scholars such as  John Brockington, argue that ''Jaya'' and ''Bharata'' refer to the same text, and ascribe the theory of ''Jaya'' with 8,800 verses to a misreading of a verse in ''Adiparvan'' (1.1.81).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=HR-_LK5kl18C&pg=PA21|title= The Sanskrit epics, Part 2| volume = Volume 12|first= J. L. |last= Brockington|page = 21|publisher = BRILL| year=1998|isbn=9004102604}}</ref>
The [[redaction]] of this large body of text was carried out after formal principles, emphasizing the numbers 18<ref>18 books, 18 chapters of the Bhagavadgita and the Narayaniya each, corresponding to the 18 days of the battle and the 18 armies (Mbh. 5.152.23)</ref> and 12. The addition of the latest parts may be dated by the absence of the ''Anushasana-parva'' and the ''Virata parva'' from the "Spitzer manuscript".<ref>The Spitzer Manuscript(Beitrage zur Kultur- und Geistesgeschichte Asiens), Austrian Academy of Sciences, 2004. It is one of the oldest Sanskrit manuscripts found on the [[Silk Road]] and part of the estate of Dr. Moritz Spitzer.</ref> The oldest surviving Sanskrit text would date to the Kushan Period (200 CE).<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/596517 The Oldest Extant Parvan-List of the Mah<U+0101>bh<U+0101>rata], Dieter Schlingloff, Journal of the [[American Oriental Society]], Vol. 89, No. 2, Apr. <U+2013> Jun. 1969, pp. 334<U+2013>338, at [[JSTOR]]</ref>

From this evidence, it is likely that the redaction into 18 books took place in the first century.
An alternative division into 20 parvas appears to have co-existed for some time. The division into 100 sub-parvas (mentioned in Mbh. 1.2.70) is older, and most parvas are named after one of their constituent sub-parvas. The ''[[Harivamsa]]'' consists of the final two of the 100 sub-parvas, and was considered an appendix (''khila'') to the ''Mahabharata'' proper by the redactors of the 18 parvas.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

According to what one character says at Mbh. 1.1.50, there were three versions of the epic, beginning with ''Manu'' (1.1.27), ''Astika'' (1.3, sub-parva 5) or ''Vasu'' (1.57), respectively. These versions would correspond to the addition of one and then another 'frame' settings of dialogues. The ''Vasu'' version would omit the frame settings and begin with the account of the birth of Vyasa. The ''astika'' version would add the ''sarpasattra'' and ''ashvamedha'' material from Brahmanical literature, introduce the name ''Mahabharata'', and identify Vyasa as the work's author. The redactors of these additions were probably [[Pa<U+00F1>caratra|Pancharatrin]] scholars who according to Oberlies (1998) likely retained control over the text until its final redaction. Mention of the [[Huna (people)|Huna]] in the ''Bhishma-parva'' however appears to imply that this parva may have been edited around the 4th century{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}.

[[File:Snakesacrifice.jpg|thumb|The snake sacrifice of Janamejaya]]
The Adi-parva includes the snake sacrifice (''sarpasattra'') of [[Janamejaya]], explaining its motivation, detailing why all snakes in existence were intended to be destroyed, and why in spite of this, there are still snakes in existence. This ''sarpasattra'' material was often considered an independent tale added to a version of the ''Mahabharata'' by "thematic attraction" (Minkowski 1991), and considered to have a particularly close connection to [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] ([[Brahmana]]) literature.  The [[Panchavimsha Brahmana]] (at 25.15.3) enumerates the officiant priests of a ''sarpasattra'' among whom the names Dhrtarashtra and Janamejaya, two main characters of the ''Mahabharata'''s ''sarpasattra'',  as well as Takshaka, the name of a snake in the ''Mahabharata'', occur.<ref>J.A.B. van Buitenen, ''Mah<U+0101>bh<U+0101>rata, Volume 1'', p.445, citing W. Caland, ''The Pa<U+00F1>cavi<U+1E43><U+015B>a Br<U+0101>hma<U+1E47>a'', p.640-2</ref>

The state of the text has been described by some early 20th century [[Indology|Indologist]]s as unstructured and chaotic. [[Hermann Oldenberg]] supposed that the original poem must once have carried an immense "tragic force", but dismissed the full text as a "horrible chaos."<ref>Hermann Oldenberg, ''Das Mahabharata: seine Entstehung, sein Inhalt, seine Form'', G<U+00F6>ttingen, 1922, {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> The judgement of other early 20th century Indologists was even less favourable. [[Moritz Winternitz]] (''Geschichte der indischen Literatur'' 1909) considered that "only unpoetical theologists and clumsy scribes" could have lumped the various parts of disparate origin into an unordered whole.

===Historical references===
{{See also|Bhagavad Gita#Date and text}}
The earliest known references to the ''Mahabharata'' and its core ''Bharata'' date back to the ''[[Ashtadhyayi]]'' ([[sutra]] 6.2.38) of [[P<U+0101><U+1E47>ini]] (fl. 4th century BCE), and in the ''[[Grhya Sutras|Ashvalayana Grhyasutra]]'' (3.4.4).
This may suggest that the core 24,000 verses, known as the ''Bharata'', as well as an early version of the extended ''Mahabharata'', were composed by the 4th century BCE.

A report by the Greek writer [[Dio Chrysostom]] (ca. 40-ca. 120 CE) about [[Homer]]'s poetry being sung even in India<ref>Dio Chrysostom, 53.[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/53*.html#6 6]-7, trans. H. Lamar Crosby, [[Loeb Classical Library]], 1946, vol. 4, p. 363.</ref> seems to imply that the ''[[Iliad]]'' had been translated into Sanskrit. However, scholars have, in general, taken this as evidence for the existence of a ''Mahabharata'' at this date, whose episodes Dio or his sources identify with the story of the ''Iliad''.<ref>[[Christian Lassen]], in his ''Indische Alterthumskunde'', supposed that the reference is ultimately to Dhritarashtra's sorrows, the laments of Gandhari and Draupadi, and the valor of Arjuna and Suyodhana or Karna (cited approvingly in [[Maximilian Wolfgang Duncker|Max Duncker]], ''The History of Antiquity'' (trans. [[Evelyn Abbott]], London 1880), vol. 4, [http://books.google.com/books?id=gIkBAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA81 p. 81]). This interpretation is endorsed in such standard references as [[Albrecht Weber]]'s ''History of Indian Literature'' but has sometimes been repeated as fact instead of as interpretation.</ref>

Several stories within the Mahabharata took on separate identities of their own in [[Classical Sanskrit literature]]. For instance, [[Abhij<U+00F1><U+0101>na<U+015B><U+0101>kuntalam|Abhij<U+00F1><U+0101>nash<U+0101>kuntala]] by the renowned Sanskrit poet [[K<U+0101>lid<U+0101>sa]] (ca. 400 CE), believed to have lived in the era of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] dynasty, is based on a story that is the precursor to the Mahabharata. [[Urubhanga]], a Sanskrit play written by [[Bh<U+0101>sa]] who is believed to have lived before K<U+0101>lid<U+0101>sa, is based on the slaying of Duryodhana by the splitting of his thighs by Bhima.

The copper-plate inscription of the [[Maharaja]] Sharvanatha (533<U+2013>534 CE) from Khoh ([[Satna]] District, [[Madhya Pradesh]]) describes the ''Mahabharata'' as a "collection of 100,000 verses" (''shatasahasri samhita'').

==Historical context==
{{See|Epic India}}

The historicity of the [[Kurukshetra War]] is unclear. Many historians  estimate the date of the Kurukshetra war to [[Iron Age India]] of the [[10th century BCE]].<ref>In discussing the dating question, historian A. L. Basham says: "According to the most popular later tradition the Mahabharata War took place in 3102 BCE, which in the light of all evidence, is quite impossible. More reasonable is another tradition, placing it in the 15th century BCE, but this is also several centuries too early in the light of our archaeological knowledge. Probably the war took place around the beginning of the 9th century BCE; such a date seems to fit well with the scanty archaeological remains of the period, and there is some evidence in the Brahmana literature itself to show that it cannot have been much earlier." Basham, p. 40, citing HC Raychaudhuri, ''Political History of Ancient India'', pp.27ff.</ref> The setting of the epic has a historical precedent in Iron Age ([[Vedic India|Vedic]]) India, where the [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]] kingdom was the center of political power during roughly 1200 to 800 BCE.<ref>M Witzel, ''Early Sanskritization: Origin and Development of the Kuru state'', EJVS vol.1 no.4 (1995); also in B. K<U+00F6>lver (ed.), ''Recht, Staat und Verwaltung im klassischen Indien. The state, the Law, and Administration in Classical India'', M<U+00FC>nchen, R. Oldenbourg, 1997, p.27-52</ref>  A dynastic conflict of the period could have been the inspiration for the ''Jaya'', the foundation on which the Mahabharata corpus was built, with a climactic battle eventually coming to be viewed as an epochal event.

[[Puranas|Puranic literature]] presents genealogical lists associated with the Mahabharata narrative. The evidence of the Puranas is of two kinds.  Of the first kind, there is the direct statement that there were 1015 (or 1050) years between the birth of Parikshit (Arjuna's grandson) and the accession of Mahapadma Nanda, commonly dated to 382 BCE, which would yield an estimate of about 1400 BCE for the Bharata battle.<ref>A.D. Pusalker, ''History and Culture of the Indian People'', Vol I, Chapter XIV, p.273</ref>  However, this would imply improbably long reigns on average for the kings listed in the genealogies.<ref>FE Pargiter, ''Ancient Indian Historical Tradition'', p.180.  He shows estimates of the average as 47, 50, 31 and 35 for various versions of the lists.</ref>
Of the second kind are analyses of parallel genealogies in the Puranas between the times of Adhisimakrishna (Parikshit's great-grandson) and Mahapadma Nanda.  Pargiter accordingly estimated 26 generations by averaging 10 different dynastic lists and, assuming 18 years for the average duration of a reign, arrived at an estimate of 850 BCE for Adhisimakrishna, and thus approximately 950 BCE for the Bharata battle.<ref>Pargiter, ''op.cit.'' p.180-182</ref>

[[B. B. Lal]] used the same approach with a more conservative assumption of the average reign to estimate a date of 836 BCE, and correlated this with archaeological evidence from [[Painted Grey Ware]] sites, the association being strong between PGW artifacts and places mentioned in the epic.<ref>B. B. Lal, ''Mahabharata and Archaeology'' in Gupta and Ramachandran (1976), p.57-58</ref>

Attempts to date the events using methods of [[archaeoastronomy]] have produced, depending on which passages are chosen  and how they are interpreted, estimates ranging from the late 4th to the mid 2nd millennium BCE.<ref>Gupta and Ramachandran (1976), p.246, who summarize as follows: "Astronomical calculations favor 15th century BCE as the date of the war while the Puranic data place it in the 10th/9th century BCE.  Archaeological evidence points towards the latter." (p.254)</ref>
The late 4th millennium date has a precedent in the calculation of the Kaliyuga epoch, based on planetary conjunctions, by [[Aryabhata]] (6th century). His date of February 18 3102 BCE has become widespread in Indian tradition (for example, the [[Aihole|Aihole inscription]] of [[Pulikeshi II]], dated to Saka 556 = 634 CE, claims that 3735 years have elapsed since the Bharata battle.<ref>Gupta and Ramachandran (1976), p.55; AD Pusalker, HCIP, Vol I, p.272</ref>)
Another traditional school of astronomers and historians, represented by [[Vriddha-Garga]], [[Varahamihira]] (author of the [[Brihat-Samhita|''Brhatsamhita'']]) and [[Kalhana]] (author of the ''[[Rajatarangini]]''), place the Bharata war 653 years after the Kaliyuga epoch, corresponding to 2449 BCE.<ref>AD Pusalker, ''op.cit.'' p.272</ref>

===Just war===

The Mahabharata offers one of the first instances of theorizing about "[[Just war theory|Just war]]", illustrating many of the standards that would be debated later across the world. In the story, one of five brothers asks if the suffering caused by war can ever be justified. A long discussion ensues between the siblings, establishing criteria like ''proportionality'' (chariots cannot attack cavalry, only other chariots, no attacking people in distress), ''just means'' (no poisoned or barbed arrows), ''just cause'' (no attacking out of rage), and fair treatment of captives and the wounded<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=UwjC1peqwx0C&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=mahabharata+%22just+war%22+-wikipedia&source=bl&ots=k1RhVg8MSB&sig=rLWi6PjpH7L716_kZ4LrPoMROhs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=55VGT8PiAtLogQeh-N2jDg&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=mahabharata%20%22just%20war%22%20-wikipedia&f=false Just War in Comparative Perspective]</ref>.

==Synopsis==
The core story of the work is that of a dynastic struggle for the throne of [[Hastinapura]], the kingdom ruled by the [[Kuru (India)|Kuru]] clan. The two collateral branches of the family that participate in the struggle are the [[Kaurava]] and the [[Pandava]]. Although the Kaurava is the senior branch of the family, [[Duryodhana]], the eldest Kaurava, is younger than [[Yudhisthira]], the eldest Pandava. Both Duryodhana and Yudhisthira claim to be first in line to inherit the throne.

The struggle culminates in the [[Kurukshetra War|great battle of Kurukshetra]], in which the [[Pandavas]] are ultimately victorious. The battle produces complex conflicts of kinship and friendship, instances of family loyalty and duty taking precedence over what is right, as well as the converse.

The ''Mahabharata'' itself ends with the death of [[Krishna]], and the subsequent end of his dynasty and ascent of the Pandava brothers to heaven. It also marks the beginning of the Hindu age of [[Kali (Demon)|Kali]] ([[Kali Yuga]]), the fourth and final age of mankind, in which great values and noble ideas have crumbled, and man is heading toward the complete dissolution of right action, morality and virtue.

Arshia Sattar states that the central theme of the Mahabharata, as well as the Ramayana, is respectively Krishna's and Rama's hidden divinity and its progressive revelation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sattar|1996|pp=lvi<U+2013>lvii}}</ref>

===The older generations===
[[Image:Ravi Varma-Shantanu and Satyavati.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Shantanu woos Satyavati, the fisherwoman. Painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]].]]

King Janamejaya's ancestor [[Shantanu]], the king of [[Hastinapura]], has a short-lived marriage with the goddess [[Ganga (goddess)|Ganga]] and has a son, Devavrata (later to be called [[Bhishma]], a great warrior), who becomes the heir apparent. Many years later, when King Shantanu goes hunting, he sees [[Satyavati]], the daughter of the chief of fisherman, and asks her father for her hand. Her father refuses to consent to the marriage unless Shantanu promises to make any future son of Satyavati the king upon his death. To resolve his father's dilemma, Devavrata agrees to relinquish his right to the throne. As the fisherman is not sure about the prince's children honouring the promise, Devavrata also takes a vow of lifelong celibacy to guarantee his father's promise.

Shantanu has two sons by Satyavati, [[Chitr<U+0101>ngada]] and [[Vichitravirya]]. Upon Shantanu's death, Chitrangada becomes king. He lives a very short uneventful life and dies. Vichitravirya, the younger son, rules [[Hastinapura]]. Meanwhile, the King of [[K<U+0101><U+015B><U+012B>]] arranges a [[swayamvara]] for his three daughters, neglecting to invite the royal family of Hastinapur. In order to arrange the marriage of young Vichitravirya, Bhishma attends the swayamvara of the three princesses Amba, Ambika and Ambalika, uninvited, and proceeds to abduct them. Ambika and Ambalika consent to be married to Vichitravirya.

The oldest princess Amba, however, informs Bhishma that she wishes to marry king of Shalva whom Bhishma defeated at their swayamvara. Bhishma lets her leave to marry king of Shalva, but Shalva refuses to marry her, still smarting at his humiliation at the hands of Bhishma. Amba then returns to marry Bhishma but he refuses due to his vow of celibacy. Amba becomes enraged and becomes Bhishma's bitter enemy, holding him responsible for her plight. Later she is reborn to King [[Drupada]] as [[Shikhandi]] (or Shikhandini) and causes Bhishma's fall, with the help of [[Arjuna]], in the battle of Kurukshetra.

===The Pandava and Kaurava princes===
When Vichitravirya dies young without any heirs, Satyavati asks her first son [[Vyasa]] to [[niyoga|father children with]] the widows. The eldest, Ambika, shuts her eyes when she sees him, and so her son [[Dhritarashtra]] is born blind. Ambalika turns pale and bloodless upon seeing him, and thus her son [[Pandu]] is born pale and unhealthy (the term Pandu may also mean 'jaundiced'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webapps.uni-koeln.de/tamil/ |title=Sanskrit, Tamil and Pahlavi Dictionaries |language={{de icon}} |publisher=Webapps.uni-koeln.de |date=2003-02-11 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}</ref>). Due to the physical challenges of the first two children, Satyavati asks Vyasa to try once again. However, Ambika and Ambalika send their maid instead, to Vyasa's room. Vyasa fathers a third son, [[Vidura]], by the maid. He is born healthy and grows up to be one of the wisest characters in the ''Mahabharata''. He serves as Prime Minister (Mahamantri or Mahatma) to King Pandu and King Dhritarashtra.

When the princes grow up, Dhritarashtra is about to be crowned king by Bhishma when Vidura intervenes and uses his knowledge of politics to assert that a blind person cannot be king. This is because a blind man cannot control and protect his subjects. The throne is then given to Pandu because of Dhritarashtra's blindness. Pandu marries twice, to [[Kunti]] and [[Madri]]. Dhritarashtra  marries [[Gandhari (character)|Gandhari]], a princess from Gandhara, who blindfolds herself so that she may feel the pain that her husband feels. Her brother [[Shakuni]] is enraged by this and vows to take revenge on the Kuru family. One day, when Pandu is relaxing in the forest, he hears the sound of a wild animal. He shoots an arrow in the direction of the sound. However the arrow hits the sage [[Kindama]], who curses him that if he engages in a sexual act, he will die. Pandu then retires to the forest along with his two wives, and his brother Dhritarashtra rules thereafter, despite his blindness.

[[File:2716 PandavaDraupadifk.jpg.jpg|thumb|250px|The central figure is Yudhishthira; the two to his left are Bhima and Arjuna. Nakula and Sahadeva, the twins, are to his right. Their wife, at far right, is Draupadi. [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh|Deogarh]], Dasavatar temple.]]
Pandu's older queen Kunti, however, had been given a boon by Sage Durvasa that she could invoke any god using a special mantra. Kunti uses this boon to ask [[Dharma]] the god of justice, [[Vayu]] the god of the wind, and [[Indra]] the lord of the heavens for sons. She gives birth to three sons, [[Yudhisthira]], [[Bhima]], and [[Arjuna]], through these gods. Kunti shares her mantra with the younger queen [[Madri]], who  bears the twins [[Nakula]] and [[Sahadeva]] through the [[Ashvins|Ashwini]] twins. However, Pandu and Madri indulge in sex, and Pandu dies. Madri [[Sati (practice)|dies on his funeral pyre]] out of remorse. Kunti raises the five brothers, who are from then on usually referred to as the [[Pandava]] brothers.

Dhritarashtra has a hundred sons through [[Gandhari (character)|Gandhari]], all born after the birth of Yudhishtira. These are the [[Kaurava]] brothers, the eldest being [[Duryodhana]], and the second [[Dushasana]]. Other Kaurava brothers were Vikarna and Sukarna. The rivalry and enmity between them and the Pandava brothers, from their youth and into manhood, leads to the [[Kurukshetra]] war.

==={{IAST|L<U+0101>k<U+1E63>ag<U+1E5B>ha}} (The House of Lac)===
After the deaths of their mother (Madri) and father (Pandu), the Pandavas and their mother Kunti return to the palace of Hastinapur. Yudhisthira is made Crown Prince by Dhritarashtra, under considerable pressure from his kingdom. Dhritarashtra wanted his own son Duryodhana to become king and lets his ambition get in the way of preserving justice.

Shakuni, Duryodhana and Dusasana plot to get rid of the Pandavas. Shakuni calls the architect Purvanchan to build a palace out of flammable materials like lac and ghee. He then arranges for the Pandavas and the Queen Mother Kunti to stay there, with the intention of setting it alight. However, the Pandavas are warned by their wise uncle, [[Vidura]], who sends them a miner to dig a tunnel. They are able to escape to safety and go into hiding. Back at Hastinapur, the Pandavas and Kunti are presumed dead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01144.htm |title=Book 1: Adi Parva: Jatugriha Parva |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}</ref>

===Marriage to Draupadi===
[[File:Swayamvara Draupadi Arjuna Archery.jpg|thumb|[[Arjuna]] piercing the eye of the fish as depicted in [[Chennakesava Temple]] built by [[Hoysala Empire]].]]
During the course of their hiding the Pandavas learn of a [[swayamvara]] which is taking place for the hand of the [[P<U+0101><U+00F1>c<U+0101>la]] princess  [[Draupad<U+012B>]]. The Pandavas enter the competition in disguise as Brahmins. The task is to string a mighty steel bow and shoot a target on the ceiling, which is the eye of a moving artificial fish, while looking at its reflection in oil below. Most of the princes fail, many being unable to lift the bow. Arjuna succeeds however. The Pandavas return home and inform their mother that Arjuna has won a competition and to look at what they have brought back. Without looking, Kunti asks them to share whatever it is Arjuna has won among themselves. On explaining the previous life of Draupadi, she ends up being the [[Fraternal polyandry|wife of all five brothers]].

===Indraprastha===
After the wedding, the Pandava brothers are invited back to Hastinapura. The Kuru family elders and relatives negotiate and broker a split of the kingdom, with the Pandavas obtaining a new territory. Yudhishtira has a new capital built for this territory at [[Indraprastha]]. Neither the Pandava nor Kaurava sides are happy with the arrangement however.

Shortly after this, Arjuna elopes with and then marries Krishna's sister, [[Subhadra]]. Yudhishtira wishes to establish his position as king; he seeks Krishna's advice. Krishna advises him, and after due preparation and the elimination of some opposition, Yudhishthira carries out the ''r<U+0101>jas<U+016B>ya yagna'' ceremony; he is thus recognised as pre-eminent among kings.

The Pandavas have a new palace built for them, by [[Mayasura|Maya]] the [[Danava (Hinduism)|Danava]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02001.htm |title=Book 2: Sabha Parva: Sabhakriya Parva |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}</ref> They invite their Kaurava cousins to Indraprastha. Duryodhana walks round the palace, and mistakes a glossy floor for water, and will not step in. After being told of his error, he then sees a pond, and assumes it is not water and falls in. [[Draupadi]] laughs at him and ridicules him by saying that this is because of his blind father [[Dhritrashtra]]. He then decides to avenge his humiliation.

===The dice game===
[[File:Disrobing of Draupadi.jpg|thumb|Draupadi humiliated.]]
Shakuni, Duryodhana's uncle, now arranges a dice game, playing against Yudhishtira with loaded dice. Yudhishtira loses all his wealth, then his kingdom. He then even gambles his brothers, himself, and finally his wife into servitude.  The jubilant Kauravas insult the Pandavas in their helpless state and even try to disrobe Draupadi in front of the entire court, but her honour is saved by Krishna who miraculously creates lengths of cloth to replace the ones being removed.

Dhritarashtra, Bhishma, and the other elders are aghast at the situation, but Duryodhana is adamant that there is no place for two crown princes in Hastinapura. Against his wishes Dhritarashtra orders for another dice game. The Pandavas are required to go into exile for 12 years, and in the 13th year must remain hidden. If discovered by the Kauravas, they will be forced into exile for another 12 years.

===Exile and return===
The Pandavas spend thirteen years in exile; many adventures occur during this time. They also prepare alliances for a possible future conflict. They spend their final year in disguise in the court of [[Virata]], and are discovered just after the end of the year.

At the end of their exile, they try to negotiate a return to Indraprastha. However, this fails, as Duryodhana objects that they were discovered while in hiding, and that no return of their kingdom was agreed. War becomes inevitable.

===The battle at Kurukshetra===
{{Main|Kurukshetra war}}
[[File:The center of battle of Kurukshetra.jpg|thumb|A scene from the Mahabharata war, [[Angkor Wat]] - A black stone relief depicting a number of men wearing a crown and a dhoti, fighting with spears, swords and bows.

A chariot with half the horse out of the frame <U+2013> is seen in the middle.]]
The two sides summon vast armies to their help, and line up at [[Kurukshetra]] for a war. The Kingdoms of [[Panchala]], [[Dv<U+0101>rak<U+0101>|Dwaraka]], [[Kasi Kingdom|Kasi]], [[Kekaya]], [[Magadha]], [[Matsya]], [[Chedi Kingdom|Chedi]], [[Pandya]], [[Telinga]], and the [[Yadu]]s of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] and some other clans like the [[Parama Kambojas]] were allied with the [[Pandava]]s. The allies of the [[Kaurava]]s included the kings of Pragjyotisha, [[Anga]], Kekaya, Sindhudesa (including [[Sindhu]]s, [[Sovira|Sauviras]] and Sivis), Mahishmati, [[Avanti (India)|Avanti]] in Madhyadesa, [[Madra]], [[Gandhara]], [[Bahlikas]], [[Kambojas]] and many others. Prior to war being declared, [[Balarama]], had expressed his unhappiness at the developing conflict, and left to go on [[pilgrimage]], thus he does not take part in the battle itself. Krishna takes part in a non-combatant role, as charioteer for Arjuna.

Before the battle, Arjuna, seeing himself facing his great grandfather [[Bhishma]] and his teacher [[Drona]] on the other side, has doubts about the battle and he fails to lift his G<U+0101>ndeeva bow. Krishna wakes him up to his call of duty in the famous [[Bhagavad Gita]] section of the epic.

Though initially sticking to chivalrous notions of warfare, both sides soon adopt dishonourable tactics. At the end of the 18-day battle, only the Pandavas, [[Satyaki]], [[Kripa]], [[Ashwatthama]], [[Kritavarma]], [[Yuyutsu]] and Krishna survive.

===The end of the Pandavas===
[[File:Totheforest.jpg|thumb|left|Gandhari, blindfolded, supporting Dhrtarashtra and following Kunti when Dhrtarashtra became old and infirm and retired to the forest. A miniature painting from a sixteenth century manuscript of part of the Razmnama, [[Persian language|Persian]] translation of the Mahabharata]]
After "seeing" the carnage, [[Gandhari (character)|Gandhari]] who had lost all her sons, curses Krishna to be a witness to a similar annihilation of his family, for though divine and capable of stopping the war, he had not done so. Krishna accepts the curse, which bears fruit 36 years later.

The Pandavas who had ruled their kingdom meanwhile, decide to renounce everything. Clad in skins and rags they retire to the [[Himalaya]] and climb towards heaven in their bodily form. A stray dog travels with them. One by one the brothers and Draupadi fall on their way. As each one stumbles, Yudhishitra gives the rest the reason for their fall (Draupadi was partial to Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva were vain and proud of their looks, Bhima and Arjuna were proud of their strength and archery skills, respectively). Only the virtuous Yudhisthira, who had tried everything to prevent the carnage, and the dog remain. The dog reveals himself to be the god Yama (also known as Yama Dharmaraja), and then takes him to the underworld where he sees his siblings and wife. After explaining the nature of the test, Yama takes Yudhishthira back to heaven and explains that it was necessary to expose him to the underworld because (Rajyante narakam dhruvam) any ruler has to visit the underworld at least once. Yama then assures him that his siblings and wife would join him in heaven after they had been exposed to the underworld for measures of time according to their vices.

Arjuna's grandson [[Parikshit]] rules after them and dies bitten by a snake. His furious son, Janamejaya, decides to perform a snake sacrifice (''[[sarpasattra]]'') in order to destroy the snakes. It is at this sacrifice that the tale of his ancestors is narrated to him.

==Versions, translations, and derivative works==
Many regional versions of the work developed over time, mostly differing only in minor details, or with verses or subsidiary stories being added. These include some versions from outside the Indian subcontinent, such as the [[Kakawin Bharatayuddha]] from [[Java]]. The plays of the [[Tamil culture|Tamil]] street theatre, [[terukkuttu]] and [[kattaikkuttu]], use themes from the Tamil language versions of Mahabharata, focusing on Draupadi.<ref>{{Cite book

===Critical Edition===
Between 1919 and 1966,  scholars at the [[Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute]], [[Pune]], compared the various manuscripts of the epic from India and abroad and produced the ''Critical Edition'' of the ''Mahabharata'', on 13,000 pages in 19 volumes, followed by the Harivamsha in another two volumes and six index volumes. This is the text that is usually used in current ''Mahabharata'' studies for reference.<ref>[http://www.virtualpune.com/html/channel/edu/institutes/html/bhandark.shtml Bhandarkar Institute, Pune]<U+2014>Virtual Pune</ref> This work is sometimes called the 'Pune' or 'Poona' edition of the Mahabharata.

===Modern interpretations===
[[File:FullPagadeYakshagana.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Krishna as portrayed in [[Yakshagana]] from [[Karnataka]] which is based largely on  stories of Mahabharata]]
The  [[Tamil people|Tamil]] writer [[S. Ramakrishnan]] has written a critically acclaimed book based on the Mahabharata called "Uba Paandavam". It discusses the story in a non-linear manner from a traveller's point of view.

The  [[Kannada language|Kannada]] novelist [[S.L. Bhyrappa]] wrote a novel in Kannada (now translated into most Indian languages and English) titled ''[[Parva (novel)|Parva]]'', giving a new interpretation to the story of Mahabharata.  He tried to understand the social and ethical practices in these regions and correlate them with the story of Mahabharata.

Malayalam writer [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]]'s novel [[Randamoozham]] (English: ''[[Second Turn]]'') tells the Mahabharata from [[Bhima]]'s point of view. Mrityunjay (English: ''Triumph Over Death'') written by [[Shivaji Sawant]] is a novel with [[Karna]] as the central character of Mahabharata.

In [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]], several film versions of the epic exist, dating back to 1920.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0154815|title=Mahabharat}} (1920 film)</ref> The internationally acclaimed [[Parallel Cinema|parallel]] [[Bengali cinema|Bengali film]] director [[Satyajit Ray]] also intended to direct a theatrical adaptation of the epic, but the project was never realized.<ref>{{cite web|title=IndiaStar book review: Satyajit Ray by Surabhi Banerjee|author=C.

In the late 1980s, the [[Mahabharat (TV series)|''Mahabharat'' TV series]], directed by Ravi Chopra,<ref name="TV">{{IMDb title|id=0158417|title=Mahabharat}} (1988<U+2013>1990 TV series)</ref> was televised and shown on India's national television ([[Doordarshan]]). In the [[Western world]], a well-known presentation of the epic is [[Peter Brook]]'s nine-hour play, which premiered in [[Avignon]] in 1985, and its five-hour movie version [[The Mahabharata (1989 film)|''The Mahabharata'' (1989)]].<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0097810|title=The Mahabharata}} (1989 mini-series)</ref>

Among literary reinterpretations of the Mahabharata is [[Shashi Tharoor]]'s major work entitled ''[[The Great Indian Novel]]'', an involved literary, philosophical, and political novel which superimposes the major moments of post-independence [[India]] in the 20th century onto the driving events of the Mahabharata epic.

Mahabharata was also reinterpreted by [[Shyam Benegal]] in [[Kalyug (1980 film)|Kalyug]]. Kalyug is a modern-day replaying of the Mahabharata.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2003/01/17/stories/2003011700990100.htm |title=What makes Shyam special |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date=2003-01-17 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}</ref>

===English translations===
The first complete English translation was the [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] prose version by [[Kisari Mohan Ganguli]],<ref>
Several editions of the [[Kisari Mohan Ganguli]] translation of the Mahabharata incorrectly cite [[Pratap Chandra Roy]] as translator and this error has been perpetuated into secondary citations. See the publishers preface to the current Munshiram Manoharlal edition for an explanation.</ref> published between 1883 and 1896 (Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers) and by M. N. Dutt ([[Motilal Banarsidass]] Publishers). Most critics consider the translation by Ganguli to be faithful to the original text. The complete text of Ganguli's translation is in the [[public domain]] and is available online:<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/maha/index.htm The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli] at the [[Internet Sacred Text Archive]]</ref> but compare with the contemporary Pratap Chandra Roy's complete translation, also in the [[public domain]].<ref>[http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Roy%2C%20Pratap%20Chandra%2C%201842-1895%22 The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa translated by Pratap Chandra Roy] at the [[Internet Archive]]</ref>

Another English prose translation of the full epic, based on the ''Critical Edition'', is also in progress, published by [[University Of Chicago]] Press, initiated by Chicago [[Indologist]] [[J. A. B. van Buitenen]] (books 1<U+2013>5) and, following a 20-year hiatus caused by the death of van Buitenen, is being continued by D. Gitomer of [[DePaul University]] (book 6), J. L. Fitzgerald  of Brown University (books 11<U+2013>13) and [[Wendy Doniger]] of the University of Chicago (books 14<U+2013>18).

An early poetry translation by [[Romesh Chunder Dutt]] and published in 1898 condenses the main themes of the Mahabharata into English verse.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19630 The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa translated by Romesh Chunder Dutt] at the Online Library of Liberty.</ref> A later poetic "transcreation" (author's own description) of the full epic into English, done by the poet [[P. Lal]] is complete, and in 2005 began being published by [[Writers Workshop]], Calcutta. The P. Lal translation is a non-rhyming verse-by-verse rendering, and is the only edition in any language to include all slokas in all recensions of the work (not just those in the ''Critical Edition'').  The completion of the publishing project is scheduled for 2010. Sixteen of the eighteen volumes are now available.

A project to translate the full epic into English prose, translated by various hands, began to appear in 2005 from the [[Clay Sanskrit Library]], published by [[New York University]] Press. The translation is based not on the ''Critical Edition'' but on the version known to the commentator [[N<U+012B>laka<U+1E47><U+1E6D>ha Caturdhara|N<U+012B>laka<U+1E47><U+1E6D>ha]]. Currently available are 15 volumes of the projected 32-volume edition.

Indian economist [[Bibek Debroy]] has also begun an unabridged English translation in ten volumes. [http://www.penguinbooksindia.com/category/Non_Fiction/The_Mahabharata_9780143100133.aspx Volume 1: Adi Parva] was published in March 2010.

===Abridged versions===
Many condensed versions, abridgements and novelistic prose retellings of the complete epic have been published in English, including works by [[Ramesh Menon]], [[William Buck]], [[R.K. Narayan]], [[C. Rajagopalachari]], [[Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi|K. M. Munshi]], [[Krishna Dharma]], [[Romesh Chunder Dutt|Romesh C. Dutt]], Bharadvaja Sarma,  [[John D. Smith]] and [[Sharon Maas]].

A Kawi version is found on the Indonesian island of Bali and was translated by Dr. [[I. Gusti Putu Phalgunadi]]. Of the eighteen parvas, only eight Kawi manuscripts remain.

===Derivative works===

[[Bhasa]], the 2nd or 3rd century AD Sanskrit playwright, wrote two plays on episodes in the Marabharata, ''[[Urubhanga]]'' (Broken Thigh), about the fight between [[Duryodhana]] and [[Bhima]], while ''[[Madhyamavyayoga]]'' (The Middle One) set around Bhima and his son, [[Ghatotkacha]]. The first important play of 20th century was ''[[Andha Yug]]'' (The Blind Epoch), by [[Dharamvir Bharati]], which came in 1955, found in ''Mahabharat'', both an ideal source and expression of modern predicaments and discontent. Starting with [[Ebrahim Alkazi]] it was staged by numerous directors. [[V. S. Khandekar]]'s Marathi novel, ''Yayati'' (1960) and [[Girish Karnad]]'s debut play ''Yayati'' (1961) are based on the story of King [[Yayati]] found in the Mahabharat.<ref>{{cite book |title=The World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: Asia|author=Don Rubin |publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1998|isbn=041505933X |url=http://books.google.com/?id=-MUiXjMUl34C&pg=PA219&dq=hindi+theatre#v=onepage&q=hindi%20theatre&f=false |page=195|ref=Ru }}</ref> Bengali writer and playwright, [[Buddhadeva Bose]] wrote three plays set in Mahabharat, ''Anamni Angana'', ''Pratham Partha'' and ''Kalsandhya''.<ref>[http://www.boloji.com/hinduism/084.htm The Mahabharata as Theatre] by Pradip Bhattacharya , June 13, 2004.</ref>

[[Jainism|Jain]] version of Mahabharata can be found in the various [[Jain texts]] like ''Harivamsapurana'' (the story of Harivamsa) ''Trisastisalakapurusa Caritra'' (Hagiography of 63 Illustrious persons),   ''Pandavacaritra'' (lives of Pandavas) and ''Pandavapurana'' (stories of Pandavas).<ref>{{Cite book| last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =Collected Papers on Jaina Studies | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | year =2000 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1691-9 }} p. 351-52</ref> From the earlier canonical literature, ''Antakrddaa<U+015B><U+0101>h'' (8th cannon) and ''Vrisnidasa'' (''upangagama'' or secondary canon) contain the stories of [[Neminatha]] (22nd [[Tirthankara]]), Krishna and Balarama.<ref>{{Cite book| last =Shah | first =Natubhai | title =Jainism: The World of Conquerors | publisher =Sussex Academy Press | year =1998 | location =Sussex | series =Volume I and II | isbn =1898723303 }}  vol 1 pp. 14<U+2013>15</ref> Prof. [[Padmanabh Jaini]] notes that, unlike in the Hindu Puranas, the names Baladeva and Vasudeva are not restricted to Balarama and Krishna in Jain puranas. Instead they serve as names of two distinct class of mighty brothers, who appear nine times in each half of  time cycles of the [[Jain cosmology]] and rule the half the earth as half-chakravartins. Jaini traces the origin of this list of brothers to the Jinacharitra by [[Bhadrabahu]] swami (3<U+2013>4 century BCE).<ref>{{Cite book| last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =Collected Papers on Jaina Studies | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | year =2000 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1691-9 }} p. 377</ref>  According to [[Jain cosmology]] Balarama, Krishna and Jarasandha are the ninth and the last set of Baladeva, Vasudeva, and Partivasudeva.<ref name="Jaini 1998">{{Cite book| last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass | year =1998 | location =New Delhi | isbn =81-208-1578-5 }} p.305</ref> The main battle is not the Mahabharata, but the fight between Krishna and Jarasandha who is killed by Krishna. Ultimately, the Pandavas and Balarama take renunciation as [[Jain monk]]s and are reborn in heavens, while on the other hand Krishna and Jarasandha are reborn in hell.<ref>{{Cite book| last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =Collected Papers on Jaina Studies | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | year =2000 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1691-9 }} p. 351</ref> In keeping with the [[Karma in Jainism|law of karma]], Krishna is reborn in hell for his exploits (sexual and violent) while Jarasandha for his evil ways. Prof. Jaini admits a possibility that perhaps because of his popularity, the Jain authors were keen to rehabilitate Krishna. The Jain texts predict that after his karmic term in hell is over sometime during the next half time-cycle, Krishna will be reborn as a Jain Tirthankara and attain [[Moksa (Jainism)|liberation]].<ref name="Jaini 1998"/> Krishna and Balrama are shown as contemporaries and cousins of 22nd Tirthankara, Neminatha.<ref>{{Cite book| last =Roy | first =Ashim Kumar | title =A history of the Jainas | publisher =Gitanjali Pub.

'''Notes'''
*'''a''': [[Shantanu]] was a king of the Kuru dynasty or kingdom, and was some generations removed from any ancestor called [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]]. His marriage to [[Ganga (goddess)|Ganga]] preceded his marriage to [[Satyavati]].
*'''b''': [[Pandu]] and [[Dhritarashtra]] were fathered by [[Vyasa]] after [[Vichitravirya]]'s death. Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidura were the sons of Vyasa with Ambika, Ambalika and a maid servant respectively.
*'''c''': [[Karna]] was born to [[Kunti]] through her invocation of [[Surya]], before her marriage to [[Pandu]].
*'''d''': [[Yudhishtira]], [[Bhima]], [[Arjuna]], [[Nakula]] and [[Sahadeva]] were acknowledged sons of [[Pandu]] but were begotten by [[Kunti]]'s invocation of various deities. They all married [[Draupadi]] (not shown in tree).
*'''e''': [[Duryodhana]] and his siblings were born at the same time, and they were of the same generation as their [[Pandava]] cousins.

The birth order of siblings is correctly shown in the family tree (from left to right), except for [[Vyasa]] and [[Bhishma]] whose birth order is not described, and Vichitravirya who was born after them. The fact that [[Ambika (Mahabharata)|Ambika]] and [[Ambalika]] are sisters is not shown in the family tree. The birth of Duryodhana took place after the birth of Karna, Yudhishtira and Bhima, but before the birth of the remaining Pandava brothers.

Some siblings of the characters shown here have been left out for clarity; these include [[Chitr<U+0101>ngada]], the eldest brother of Vichitravirya. [[Vidura]], half-brother to Dhritarashtra and Pandu.

==Cultural influence==
In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains to Arjuna his duties as a warrior and prince and elaborates on different [[Yoga|Yogic]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yoga.about.com/od/bhagavadgita/a/thegita.htm |title=Introduction to the Bhagavad Gita |publisher=Yoga.about.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}</ref> and [[Vedantic]] philosophies, with examples and analogies. This has led to the Gita often being described as a concise guide to [[Hindu philosophy]] and a practical, self-contained guide to life.<ref>Maharishi Mahesh Yogi; On The Bhagavad Gita; A New Translation and Commentary With Sanskrit Text Chapters 1 to 6, Preface p.9</ref> In modern times, [[Swami Vivekananda]], [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and many others used the text to help inspire the [[Indian independence movement]].<ref>Stevenson, Robert W., "Tilak and the Bhagavadgita's Doctrine of Karmayoga", in: Minor, p. 44.</ref><ref>Jordens, J.
