'''County Route 550''', abbreviated '''CR 550''', is a [[county highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]]. The highway extends {{convert|15.92|mi|km}} from Delsea Drive ([[New Jersey Route 47|Route 47]]) in [[Maurice River Township, New Jersey|Maurice River Township]] to Shore Drive ([[U.S. Route 9 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 9]]) in [[Dennis Township, New Jersey|Dennis Township]]. The road travels through [[Maurice River Township, New Jersey|Maurice River Township]] ([[Cumberland County, New Jersey|Cumberland County]]), [[Dennis Township, New Jersey|Dennis Township]] ([[Cape May County, New Jersey|Cape May County]]) and [[Woodbine, New Jersey|Woodbine]].

== Route description ==
CR 550 begins at an intersection with [[New Jersey Route 47|Route 47]] in [[Maurice River Township, New Jersey|Maurice River Township]], [[Cumberland County, New Jersey|Cumberland County]], heading east on two-lane undivided Leesburg-Belleplain Road. The road runs through dense woods with pockets of farms, crossing [[New Jersey Route 347|Route 347]] before running through the [[Belleplain State Forest]]. CR 550 enters [[Dennis Township, New Jersey|Dennis Township]] in [[Cape May County, New Jersey|Cape May County]] and becomes Hoffmans Mill Road. The road passes areas of farm fields and homes as it reaches the CR 550 Spur junction and makes a turn northeast onto Tuckahoe Road. A short distance later, the route turns southeast onto Webster Avenue, with CR 605 continuing north on Tuckahoe Road.  CR 550 heads into heavy woodland again as it continues into [[Woodbine, New Jersey|Woodbine]]. In Woodbine, the route passes residences as it reaches the [[County Route 557 (New Jersey)|CR 557]] intersection.<ref name=SLD/><ref name=gm>{{google maps|url= http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=route+47+and+county+road+550&daddr=Hoffman+Mill+Rd+to:route+9+and+woodbine+ocean+view+road&geocode=FYwKVwId6wqI-ykjslkITUvHiTG7uhguv0BjPQ%3BFTwaVwIdDk-J-w%3BFWjiVQIdXsKL-ynnnJATrrvAiTFT1R-oF5EGVg&hl=en&mra=ls&via=1&sll=39.254588,-74.872341&sspn=0.055828,0.1684&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=12|title=overview of County Route 550|accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref>

At this point, CR 550 turns northeast to form a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with CR 557 on Washington Avenue while CR 638 continues east on Webster Avenue. The road passes a mix of homes and businesses as it comes to Dehirsch Avenue, where CR 550 splits from CR 557 by heading southeast on that road. CR 550 continues through developed areas, with the surroundings becoming more rural as the route intersects CR 660 and passes under the [[Cape May Seashore Lines]] railroad. After crossing CR 610, the road enters dense woodland and crosses back into Dennis Township, with the name becoming Woodbine-Ocean View Road.  The route crosses CR 608 and CR 628, continuing into wooded residential areas at the intersection with the latter. CR 550 continues from this point to its eastern terminus at [[U.S. Route 9 in New Jersey|US 9]].<ref name=SLD/><ref name=gm/>
