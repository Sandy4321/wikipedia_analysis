Athersmith was born in [[Bloxwich]], [[Staffordshire]]. He played the majority of his career at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], making 307 appearances and scoring 85 goals.  

While at Villa Athersmith played a key role in their title winning sides of 1894, 1896, 1897, 1899 and 1900 as well as reaching three F A cup finals, finishing on the losing side in [[FA Cup Final 1892|1892]] before gaining winners medals in [[FA Cup Final 1895|1895]] and [[The Double|Double]]-winning [[FA Cup Final 1897|final]] of the [[1896-97 in English football|1896<U+2013>97 season]]. Athersmith's time at [[Villa Park]] also saw him in the side who suffered a sensational F A cup exit against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall Athletic]] in 1900<ref>[http://www.freewebs.com/captainbeecher/number18.htm Match report Aston Villa vs Millwall Athletic 1900]</ref>

In 1901 he joined [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]], where he made 106 appearances and scored 13 goals.<ref>{{cite book |author=Matthews, Tony |title=Birmingham City: A Complete Record |year=1995 |publisher=Breedon Books |location=Derby |pages=pp.&nbsp;148<U+2013>151 |isbn=978-1-85983-010-9}}</ref>

Athersmith represented [[England national football team|England]] at [[outside right]] on 12 occasions and scored three goals, each of which came against [[Ireland national football team (1882<U+2013>1950)|Ireland]].

He died in [[Shifnal]], [[Shropshire]] at the age of 38.

Many Villa fans from the era often recalled a famous incident during a league game in 1901 against Sheffield United which was played in driving freezing rain. Many of the players, including the legendary United goalkeeper [[Willie Foulke]] suffered mild frostbite in the bitter conditions. Finally, early in the second half Charlie had had enough and borrowed an umbrella from a member of the crowd. Minutes later United [[Ernie Needham]] went one better and took a great coat from a spectator. Athersmith, complete with umbrella later scored.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/article587435.ece Athersmith and the umbrella]</ref>
