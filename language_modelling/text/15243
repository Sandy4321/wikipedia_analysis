'''''Resident Evil''''' is a British-German<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117917196.html|title=Resident Evil: Apocalypse Review|last=Foundas|first=Scott|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=March 10, 2002|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}</ref> 2002 [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Paul W.S. Anderson]]. The film stars [[Milla Jovovich]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Eric Mabius]], and [[James Purefoy]]. It is based on the [[Resident Evil|same titled]] series of [[survival horror]] [[video game|game]]s [[video game developer|developed]] by [[Capcom]]. Borrowing elements from the video games ''[[Resident Evil (video game)|Resident Evil]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', the film follows [[amnesia]]c heroine [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] and a band of [[Umbrella Corporation]] commandos as they attempt to contain the outbreak of the T-Virus at a secret underground facility.

The film received many negative reviews from critics but was commercially successful, grossing more than $102 million worldwide. The first in the [[Resident Evil (film series)|''Resident Evil'' film franchise]], it was followed by three [[sequel]]s: ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse|Apocalypse]]'' (2004), ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction|Extinction]]'' (2007) and ''[[Resident Evil: Afterlife|Afterlife]]'' (2010).

==Plot==
Inside the Hive, a top-secret [[genetic research]] facility owned by the [[Umbrella Corporation]] located beneath [[Raccoon City]], a thief throws a vial of the T-Virus into a lab causing it to escape into the air vents. The vial breaks and the facility's [[artificial intelligence]], the [[Red Queen and White Queen|Red Queen]], detects possible  [[infection]]. It seals the Hive, trapping and killing everyone inside.

[[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] ([[Milla Jovovich]]) awakens in an empty mansion with [[amnesia]]. She and a police officer, Matt ([[Eric Mabius]]), are seized by a group of [[commando]]s and taken to an underground train station that leads to The Hive. The group discovers Spence ([[James Purefoy]]), also suffering from amnesia. The head of the commandos, "One" ([[Colin Salmon]]), explains that everyone in the group except Matt is an employee of the Umbrella Corporation. The Red Queen released a nerve gas in the mansion that caused their amnesia. The group boards the train and travels to The Hive.

They find their way to The Queen's chamber, but it is protected by a laser defense system. Four of the commandos are killed including One. The only commandos left alive are Rain ([[Michelle Rodriguez]]), Kaplan ([[Martin Crewes]]), and J.D. They set up an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] device to disable The Queen. The AI manifests itself as the holographic of a young girl and pleads with them not to disable it, claiming that if they do then bad things will happen. The Queen's warnings are ignored; the system is disabled and the power fails, causing all of the doors to open, releasing the zombified staff into The Hive. During a running battle with the zombies, Rain becomes infected after being bitten and J.D is killed. Alice and Spence begin to regain their memories, but Matt and Alice are separated from Kaplan, Rain and Spence. Matt looks for information about his sister while Alice encounters several experimental dogs and surprises herself when she uses [[martial arts]] to defend herself. 

Matt finds his sister, Lisa ([[Heike Makatsch]]), is already a zombie. As she attacks him Alice arrives in time to save him. Matt explains that he and Lisa attempted to smuggle out a sample of the blue vial, the T-Virus, to take down Umbrella. Matt believes that Lisa's contact is the one to blame for supposedly betraying her. Alice remembers she was Lisa's contact, but does not tell Matt. After being chased, the survivors reunite at The Queen's chamber. Alice turns The Queen back on in order to find an exit; the Red Queen agrees to help them. As they try escaping through the maintenance tunnels, they are ambushed by zombies. Kaplan is separated from the rest as pipes collapse while the group is crossing over them. Alice remembers that an anti-virus exists, a vial of green liquid.

At the lab they find the vials containing the T-[[Virus]] and anti-virus are gone. Spence regains his memory and realizes he was the person who stole and released the virus. He stashed the vials on the train. Spence gets bitten then traps the survivors in the lab then heads toward the train. Before he can inject himself with the anti-virus he is killed by a mutated creature called a Licker. The Red Queen offers to spare Alice and Matt if they kill Rain, who has been infected for too long for the anti-virus to work. As the Licker attempts to bash through the lab window to get to them, Rain tells Alice to chop off her head. After Alice smashes the monitor which the Red Queen was using to talk to them, a power-outage occurs. The laboratory door opens to reveal Kaplan, who has disabled the Red Queen.

The four survivors start the train before The Hive is quarantined again. As they head back to the mansion, the Licker hurls Kaplan from the train. Alice battles the Licker as Matt kills a now zombified Rain.  After being clawed by the Licker, Matt opens a door on the floor of the train, causing the Licker to be dragged along the track and burned to death. Matt and Alice arrive at the mansion, escaping before the doors close.  Matt begins mutating due to his wounds. Before Alice can give him the anti-virus the mansion doors burst open and Umbrella scientists seize them. They subdue Alice and take Matt away, revealing he is to be put into the "[[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis Program]]" and they intend to re-open the Hive. Alice attempts to fight them off, but is overpowered and knocked unconscious.

Alice awakens at the Raccoon City Hospital strapped to an examination table. After escaping, she goes outside to find Raccoon City a chaotic abandoned mess. A newspaper clipping shows that the [[Resident Evil: Apocalypse|T-Virus spread to the surface]] after Umbrella reopened the Hive, creating an army of undead which devastated the city within hours. Alice arms herself with a shotgun from a nearby police car as the film ends.

==Production==
===Pre-production===
In 1999, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]] and [[Capcom]] [[Greenlight|greenlit]] a ''Resident Evil'' film with [[George A. Romero]] signed on as the [[Film director|film's director]] and [[screenplay]] writer.  Romero's association with Capcom, the ''Resident Evil'' video game series creators, had extended from 1998 when Romero directed an [[Advertising|ad campaign]] for ''Biohazard 2'' (''[[Resident Evil 2]]'') in Japan.  Romero stated in an official appearance in Universal Studio's Talk City chatroom that he had his secretary play the entire game through and record the gameplay so he could study it as a resource.  Romero's screenplay revolved around the plot of the [[Arklay Mountains|Arklay incident]] and included characters from the ''Resident Evil'' video games. [[Chris Redfield]] and [[Jill Valentine]] were the lead characters, involved in a romantic relationship.  [[Barry Burton]], [[Rebecca Chambers (character)|Rebecca Chambers]], [[Ada Wong]] and [[Albert Wesker]] were to also appear.  The ending to the film would have been similar to that of the ''Resident Evil'' video game.<ref>{{cite web | title = Resident Evil Original Screenplay | publisher = Dailyscript.com | url = http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/resident_evil_romero.html |last1= Romero |first1= George A. |authorlink= George A.

Hired by Sony, [[Paul W.S.

The role of Matt Addison then went to [[Eric Mabius]] who was cast in March 2001,<ref name="Boreanaz" /> along with [[Heike Makatsch]], who was cast as Matt Addison's sister [[Lisa Addison]], an employee working for [[Umbrella Corporation|Umbrella's]] [[The Hive (Resident Evil)|Hive facility]].<ref name="Official">{{cite news| title= Official Information Released| publisher= countingdown.com| date= 2001-03-16| url= http://www.countingdown.com/movies/13839/news?item_id=13974| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref>

The [[Film score|film's score]] and [[Resident Evil (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] were composed by [[Clint Mansell]],<ref>{{cite news| title= Clint Mansell Will Handle Music| publisher= countingdown.com| date= 2001-03-14| url= http://www.countingdown.com/movies/13839/news?item_id=13848| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref> [[Marco Beltrami]] and [[Marilyn Manson]]<ref>{{cite news| title= Marilyn Manson Talks About Scoring Film| publisher= countingdown.com| date= 2001-11-15| url= http://www.countingdown.com/movies/13839/news?item_id=350040| accessdate= 2007-12-02}}</ref> during mid 2001.

The film was originally subtitled as "''Resident Evil: Ground Zero''"<ref name="Locations" /><ref>{{cite web| title= Small Title Change| publisher= countingdown.com| date= 2001-08-11| url= http://www.countingdown.com/movies/13839/news?item_id=285623| accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref> when the movie was considered a [[prequel]] to the games, however the subtitle was removed due to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 attacks]].<ref name="DVD" /> The film's first plot as of March 16, 2001 revealed that Jovovich's [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] and Rodriguez's Rain were the leaders of a [[Commando|commando team]] sent in to prevent a viral outbreak from spreading to the rest of the world,<ref name="Official" /> however those details were later changed.

The film contains various references to ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''; the obvious being the main character's name, another is the use of a white rabbit for testing the T-Virus. The wall that opens to the train station appears as a mirror (''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''), the [[Red Queen and White Queen|Red Queen]] and her behavior, wanting to [[Decapitation|behead]]/kill people, are references to the book; the Red Queen's first kill is actually a beheading.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120804/trivia <!-- also Directors DVD commentary --></ref>  In addition, the Red Queen's character was added into the film's story as a [[homage]] to ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' an allusion to [[HAL 9000]].<ref name="Tomatoes" />

During production, professional dancers were hired to star as zombies as they had better control of their body movements.<ref name="DVD" />  While computer effects were used on some zombies, much of the undead appearances were accomplished through make-up while their movements were a more [[laissez-faire]] approach, as Anderson told the actors to move however they thought a zombie would, given their conditions.<ref name="DVD" />  Whilst filming, there was a shortage of manpower where the available dancers were not enough to represent the required numbers of undead, however some of [[Capcom]]'s executives and several of the film producers including [[Jeremy Bolt]] agreed to make appearances.<ref name="DVD" />  The film's [[stunt coordinator]] also made an appearance as the dog trainer while Bolt's girlfriend and sister both appeared as zombies.<ref name="DVD" />

Anderson did not direct the second and third films due to filming commitments with ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]''  and ''[[Death Race (film)|Death Race]]''<ref name="Production Notes">{{cite web | author=| year=Fall 2007| title=Resident Evil: Extinction Production Notes| format= | work=sonypictures.com | url=http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0oGklz7V3BHZ3AB1qlXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTE4bW8zNjNoBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDNgRjb2xvA3NrMQR2dGlkA0Y4MjNfOTIEbANXUzE-/SIG=14pfi5avn/EXP=1198631291/**http%3a//www.sonypictures.com/movies/residentevilextinction/site/download.php%3ffile=library/ResidentEvilExtinction_ProductionNotes.pdf| accessdate = 2007-12-20}}</ref> but instead functioned as the scriptwriter and producer on both. These films were directed by [[Alexander Witt]] and [[Russell Mulcahy]] respectively, while Anderson returned to direct the fourth film in the franchise.

==Relationship to the games==
Various elements are borrowed from numerous video games including ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'',<ref name="DVD" /> where Alice's character awakes in [[Raccoon City]] Hospital with a viral outbreak occurring in the city.  There are several references to characters and organizations such as the [[Umbrella Corporation]], the [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]] program, the underground train bearing the moniker "Alexi-5000" a reference to ''[[Resident Evil Code: Veronica]]''{{'}}s villain [[Alexia Ashford]] (the train is from Resident Evil 2, but in the game it reads "Galaxie-5000" instead of "Alexi-5000") and a police cruiser, from which Alice takes out a [[shotgun]], has a "[[Special Tactics And Rescue Service|S.T.A.R.S.]]" logo on the hood.<ref name="DVD" />  [[Jason Isaacs]] appears in the film as an uncredited masked surgeon (which is a reference to [[William Birkin]]).  The character of [[Dr. Sam Isaacs|Dr. Isaacs]] (played by [[Iain Glen]]) in the film's sequels is dedicated to or based on him.<ref name="DVD">{{cite video| people= Paul W.S. Anderson| title= ''Resident Evil Commentary''| medium= DVD| publisher= Sony Entertainment|date= 2002}}</ref>

Other references to the first game include Alice examining the [[Arklay Research Facility#Spencer Mansion in other media|mansion]] by going outside; crows are visible for a very short moment.  These crows were all digitized.  In the video game series, crows are minor enemies that the player encounters throughout each game.<ref name="DVD" />  Alice finds a picture of her wedding day with [[Spence Parks|Spence]], which is the same style as the photos in the first version of the ''Resident Evil'' game: in black and white with the foreground image (in this case, Alice and Spencer) noticeably [[Photo manipulation#Photoshopping|spliced]] onto the background (the room behind them).<ref name="DVD" />  On the newspaper at the end of the movie, the words ''"Horror in Raccoon City! More Victims Dead!"'' are shown in the upper right corner.  This is a reference to the same newspaper in the censored opening of the original ''[[Resident Evil (video game)|Resident Evil]]'' game and the prologue chapter for the ''[[Resident Evil (video game)#Novelization|Resident Evil: The Umbrella Conspiracy]]'' novel.<ref name="DVD" />  Near the beginning of the film, Alice examines a statue after the wind blows its cover off.  This statue is similar in design to one in the mansion of the first game, and which contains the map of the ground floor.<ref name="DVD" />

When going back to the Red Queen's chamber, Kaplan points out that the four bodies of the group's dead crew from the ''Glass Hallway Trap'' sequence are gone.  This is a reference to a noticeable trait in the games, where when a character leaves the room where they have killed zombies and then comes back, the bodies that were once there have disappeared.<ref name="DVD" />  The film also borrows a plot element from ''Resident Evil 2'' in which Leon and [[Claire Redfield|Claire]] have to escape the underground labs by taking the train and have a showdown with a large creature in the back of the car.  When the survivors make their escape from the Hive with a countdown as they fight the final boss, this is a reference to the ''Resident Evil'' game which ends with a five minute countdown during which the boss must be defeated.<ref name="DVD" />

A faux newspaper created by [[Screen Gems]] for ''Apocalypse'', ''The Raccoon City Times'', indicates hours after the initial outbreak, creatures began appearing in the Arklay Mountains feasting on victims.  This is similar to the opening of the first video game.<ref>[http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/residentevilapocalypse/site/raccooncitynews.pdf Raccoon City Times] - sonypictures.com {{Retrieved|accessedate = 2007-10-18}}</ref> 

Anderson has stated that the film's [[camera angle]]s and several shots allude to the video game's camera angles, such as the fight between Alice and the security guard.<ref name="DVD" />  These include a scene near the beginning where there is a close up of Alice's eye.  This is a direct reference to the title screen of the [[Resident Evil (video game)|first game]].<ref name="DVD" />  In another scene, Alice awakes and hears a creepy sound which is also a reference to the plot of the first game.<ref name="DVD" />

Numerous elements from the film have been referenced in several of the ''Resident Evil'' video games  after the film's original release.  This includes the laser corridor sequence which appeared in both ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' (where [[Leon S. Kennedy]] has to evade a security trap)<ref name="Gamefaqs">{{cite news| title= Resident Evil 4 Laser Corridor| publisher= gamefaqs.com| date= 2005-03-15| url= http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/gamecube/file/535840/34817| accessdate= 2007-11-28}}</ref> and ''[[Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles]]'' (where [[Chris Redfield]] and [[Jill Valentine]] have to evade a trap in Umbrella's Russian facility).<ref>{{cite video| title= Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles Laser Room

The main 'boss' in the film, (the T-virus injected human tissue) is a "Licker" from ''Resident Evil 2''.

Alice is introduced as a mysterious "woman in red", as does recurring ''Resident Evil'' character [[Ada Wong]]. This is further motioned by the fact that even though Alice didn't know it, her combat training is that of a highly trained soldier. This mirrors Ada's role in ''Resident Evil 2'', other than Ada intentionally keeping her true self a mystery to protagonist [[Leon Kennedy]].
