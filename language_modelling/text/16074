A '''reflector''' or '''reflex sight''' is a generally non-[[magnification|magnifying]] optical device that allows the user to look through a partially reflecting glass element and see an illuminated projection of an aiming point or some other image superimposed on the [[field of view]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=g_YXAAAAYAAJ&pg=SA8-PA27&dq=%22collimator+sight%22+reflex&hl=en&ei=k2SKTeqEGYmE0QHKvLHzDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CFIQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=%22collimator%20sight%22%20reflex&f=false Elementary optics and application to fire control instruments By United States.

The viewer looking through the glass plate or curved mirror ''reflector'' sees an image of the reticle in front of them that stays in alignment with the device the sight is attached to regardless of their eye position, removing most of the [[parallax]] error found in [[Sight (device)#Simple sights|simple sighting devices]]. 

Since their invention in 1900, reflector sights have come to be used as gun [[Sight (device)|sight]]s on all kinds of weapons from small [[firearm]]s to [[fighter aircraft]]. They are also used in civilian applications such as [[optical telescope]] pointing aids, camera [[viewfinder]]s and as the base component in many types of [[head-up display]].

==Overview==
[[File:Reflector reflex sight diagram 3.png|thumb|250px|right|Diagram of  three types of reflector sights. The top uses a collimating lens (CL) and a beam splitter (B) to create a  [[virtual image]] at infinity (V) of a reticule (R). The bottom two use half silvered curved mirrors (CM) as the collimating optics.]]

Reflector sights work by using a lens or an image forming [[curved mirror]] with a luminous or reflective overlay image or [[reticle]] at its focus, creating an [[Collimator#Optical collimators|optical collimator]] that produces a virtual image of that reticle. The image is reflected off some form of angled [[beam splitter]] or the partially [[silvered]] collimating curved mirror itself so that the observer (looking through the beam splitter or mirror) will see the image at the focus of the collimating optics superimposed in the sight's field of view in focus at ranges up to [[infinity]]. Since the optical collimator produces a reticle image made up of [[collimated light]], light that is nearly parallel, the light making up that image is theoretically perfectly parallel with the axis of the device or [[gun barrel]] it is aligned with, i.e. with no [[parallax]] at infinity. The collimated reticle image can also be seen at any eye position in the cylindrical volume of collimated light created by the sight behind the optical window.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=BIVUAAAAMAAJ&q=%22the+reticle+may+be+illuminated+by+a+small+lamp+to+permit+night+use%22&dq=%22the+reticle+may+be+illuminated+by+a+small+lamp+to+permit+night+use%22&hl=en&ei=oO-JTdeTE4Oitge4nO35DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA  McGraw-Hill encyclopedia of science and technology, page 305 -McGraw-Hill Book Company <U+2013> 2002]</ref> But this also means, for targets closer than infinity, sighting towards the edge of the optical window can make the reticle move in relation to the target since the observer is sighting down a parallel light bundle at the edge. Eye movement perpendicular to the devices [[optical axis]] will make the reticle image move in exact relationship to eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the collimating optics.<ref>[http://www.bullseyepistol.com/dotsight.htm Encyclopedia of Bullseye Pistol<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>American rifleman: Volume 93, National Rifle Association of America - THE REFLECTOR SIGHT By JOHN B. BUTLER, page 31</ref>

A common type (used in applications such as aircraft gun sights) uses a collimating lens and a beam splitter (Fig. 1 right). This type tends to be bulky since it requires at least two optical components, the lens and the beam splitter/glass plate. The reticle collimation optics are situated at 90<U+00B0> to the optical path making lighting difficult, usually needing additional electric illumination, condensing lenses, etc. A more compact type (Fig.2) replaces the lens/beam splitter configuration with a half silvered or [[Dichroic filter|dichroic]] curved collimating mirror set at an angle that performs both tasks of focusing and combining the image of an offset reticle. This type works well as a small arms sight. It is also possible to place the reticle between the viewer and the curved mirror at the mirror<U+2019>s focus (Fig. 3). The reticle itself is too close to the eye to be in focus but the curved mirror presents the viewer with an image of the reticle at infinity. This type was invented by Dutch [[optical engineer]] [[Lieuwe Van Albada]]  in 1932<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=cuzYl4hx-B8C&pg=PA466&lpg=PA466&dq=%22van+albada%22+camera&source=bl&ots=n0GpATxAPz&sig=rFJyJitGxV0Hr_jzoTyYG3YVS3w&hl=en&ei=IOGVTYPpLaTh0gGOlrTlCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22van%20albada%22%20camera&f=false Sidney F.

Reflector sights are generally non-focusing sights, simply a projected reticle bounced off a beam splitter or curved mirror right into the users eye. This gives them the defining characteristics of not needing considerable experience and skill to use, as opposed to simple mechanical sights such as [[iron sights]]. This also gives them the characteristic of being a better alternative to sighting devices based on [[optical telescope]]s in the aspects of field of view and eye relief in that reflector sights actually have neither: depending on design constraints their field of view is the users naked eye field of view, the sight simply puts a reticle right in the middle of it, and their non-focusing collimated nature means they have no eye relief. There are reflector type sights that are [[Optical telescope|telescopic]], either by design or via add on lens kits, but they re-introduce the problems of narrow field of view and limited eye relief.<ref>American rifleman: Volume 93, National Rifle Association of America - THE REFLECTOR SIGHT By JOHN B. BUTLER, page 31</ref> The primary drawback of reflector sight is that they need some way to illuminate the reticle to function. Reticles illuminated by ambient light are hard to use in low light situations, and sights with electrical illumination stop functioning all together if that system fails.<ref>American rifleman: Volume 93, National Rifle Association of America - THE REFLECTOR SIGHT By JOHN B. BUTLER, page 29</ref>

==History==
[[File:Reflector reflex sight howard grubb 1901.png|thumb|400px|left|1901 diagram of a version of Howard Grubb<U+2018>s collimating  reflector sight designed to make a compact version suitable for firearms and small devices. Ambient lighting of the reticle was improved by placing it facing up and bouncing it off a relay mirror then off a concave collimating mirror.]]

The idea of a reflector sight originated in 1900 with  [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Optical engineering|optical designer]] and telescope maker [[Howard Grubb|Sir Howard Grubb]] in patent No.12108.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=Yk-GAAAAIAAJ&q=%22reflector+sight%22+invented+Grubb&dq=%22reflector+sight%22+invented+Grubb&hl=en&ei=RaqgTcfdCJOz0QGxoYCbBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ John Murray, Science progress, Volume 76, page 498]</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=VcsKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA227&dq=grubb+for+sighting+devices+for+guns&hl=en&ei=VJOTTdL5OYiL0QG7zf3MBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CGIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Nature, Volume 65, January 9,1902, edited by Sir Norman Lockyer, page 226]</ref> Grubb conceived of his <U+201C>''Gun Sight for large and small Ordnance''<U+201D> as a better alternative to the difficult to use iron sight while avoiding the [[telescopic sight]]'s limited field of view, greater apparent target speed, parallax errors, and the danger of keeping the eye against an eye stop. In the 1901 THE <U+201C>SCIENTIFIC TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL DUBLIN SOCIETY<U+201D>  He described his invention as:

:''It would be possible to conceive an arrangement by which a fine beam of light like that from a search light would be projected from a gun in the direction of its axis and so adjusted as to correspond with the line of fire so that wherever the beam of light impinged upon an object the shot would hit. This arrangement would be of course equally impracticable for obvious reasons but it is instanced to show that a beam of light has the necessary qualifications for our purposes.''

:''Now the sight which forms the subject of this Paper attains a similar result not by projecting an actual spot of light or an image on the object but by projecting what is called in optical language a virtual image upon it.''<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=pIzpAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA353&lpg=PA353&dq=Transactions+of+the+Royal+Dublin+Society+March+20+1901&source=bl&ots=SoFiUSEcXx&sig=NG5Wek7LoxTHzY1hPxgw_Z076b0&hl=en&ei=wbGXTd-_MuGX0QGg0uz6Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=grubb&f=false The scientific transactions of the Royal Dublin]</ref> 

It was noted soon after its invention that the sight could be a good alternative to iron sights and also had uses in surveying and measuring equipment.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=UPUQAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA118&img=1&zoom=3&hl=en&sig=ACfU3U2P7PrBCACw95acwK1lWUXY-cQOGw&ci=123%2C256%2C790%2C120&edge=0 The Mining engineer, Volume 23 By Institution of Mining Engineers (Great Britain).

==Weapon sights==

Reflector sights were invented as an improved gun-sight and since their invention they have been adapted to many types of weapons. When used with different types of guns, reflector sights are considered an improvement over simple iron sights (sights composed of two spaced metal aiming points that have to be aligned).<ref>Applied optics and optical engineering, Volume 5, Part 2 - Page 198 Rudolf Kingslake, Robert Rennie Shannon, James C. Wyant  Applied optics and optical engineering, Volume 5, Part 2 - Page 198</ref> Iron sights take considerable experience and skill in the user who has to hold a proper eye position and simultaneously focus on the rear sight, the front sight, a target at different distances, and align all three ''planes of focus'' to achieve a hit.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=F6qwoLzjlI0C&pg=PA148&dq=gun+sights+three+planes&hl=en&ei=CKnKTbBIxdSAB8XA4fsF&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CGYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false Dan Shideler, Gun Digest 2011, page 148]</ref><ref>Transactions, Volume 23 By Institution of Mining Engineers (Great Britain), Federated Institution of Mining Engineers, page 125</ref> The reflector sight<U+2019>s single parallax free virtual image in focus with the target removes this aiming problem, helping poor, average, and good shooters alike. 

Since the [[collimated light|collimated]] image produced by the sight is only truly parallax free at infinity, the sight has an error circle equal to the diameter of the collimating optics for any target at a finite distance. Depending on the eye position behind the sight and the closeness of the target this induces some aiming error.<ref>[http://www.bullseyepistol.com/dotsight.htm Encyclopedia of Bullseye Pistol<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On small arms aimed at close targets this is compensated for by keeping the reticle in the middle of the optical window (sighting down its [[optical axis]]).<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=bWYbAQAAMAAJ&q=red+dot+sight+centered&dq=red+dot+sight+centered&hl=en&ei=gqIlToeqIen10gHA8MDdCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA Tony L. Jones, The police officer's guide to operating and surviving in low-light and no-light conditions, page 86]</ref> For larger targets at a distance (given the non-magnifying, quick target acquisitions nature of the sight) this aiming error is considered trivial.<ref>American rifleman: Volume 93, National Rifle Association of America - THE REFLECTOR SIGHT By JOHN B. BUTLER, page 31</ref>

Compared to standard telescopic sights, a reflector sight with no magnification can be held at any distance from the eye (don<U+2019>t require a designed [[eye relief]]), and at almost any angle, without distorting the image of the target or reticle, and without causing the reticle to "move" relative to the target. They are often used with both eyes open (the brain will tend to automatically superimpose the illuminated reticle image coming from the [[dominant eye]] onto the other eye's unobstructed view), giving the shooter normal [[depth perception]] and full [[field of view]]. Since Reflector sights are not dependent on eye relief, they can theoretically be placed in any mechanically-convenient mounting position on a weapon.

===Aircraft sights===
[[File:Revi C12-A.jpg|thumb|right|Longitudinal cross-section of a basic ''reflector sight'' for pre-WWII German fighter planes (1937 German Revi C12/A).]]
The earliest record of the reflector sight being used with fighter aircraft was in 1918. The optical firm of Optische Antal Oigee of Berlin, working from the Grubb patents, developed 2 versions what came to be known as the Oigee Reflector Sight. Both used a 45 degree angle glass beam splitter and electrical illumination and were used to aim the planes machine guns. One version was used in operational trials on the Albatros D.Va fighter biplane and  Fokker Dr.1 fighter triplane.<ref>British Aircraft Armament Vol.2: Guns and Gunsights", by R Wallace Clarke, page 134</ref> There was some interest in this sight after World War I but reflector sights in general were not widely adopted for fighter and bomber aircraft until the 1930s, first by the French, then by most other major airforces. <ref>[http://liberatorcrew.com/15_Gunnery/08_sights.htm LiberatorCrew.com, Gunsights - Reflector and Computing sights]</ref> These sights were not only used for aiming fighter aircraft, they were used with aircraft defensive guns and in bombsights. 

Reflector sights as aircraft gun-sights have many advantages. The pilot/gunner need not position their head to align the sight line precisely as they did in two-point mechanical sights, head position is only limited to that determined by the optics in the collimator, mostly by the diameter of the collimator lens. The sight does not interfere with the overall view, particularly when the collimator light is turned off. Both eyes may be used simultaneously for sighting.
[[File:HUD view.jpg|thumb|left|200px|HUD display view]]
The optical nature of the reflector sight meant it was possible to feed other information into field of view, such as modifications of the aiming point due to [[Deflection (military)|deflection]] determined by input from a gyroscope.<ref>Lon O. Nordeen, Air warfare in the missile age, page 265</ref> 1939 saw  the development by the British of  the first of these [[gyro gunsight]]s, reflector sights adjusted by gyroscope for the aircrafts speed and rate of turn, enabling the display of a lead-adjusted sighting reticle  that lagged the actual "boresight" of the weapon(s), allowing the boresight to lead the target in a turn by the proper amount for an effective strike<ref>Lon O. Nordeen, Air warfare in the missile age, page 265</ref> 

As reflector sight designs advanced after World War II, giving the pilot more and more information, they eventually evolved into the [[head up display]] (HUD). <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=ESR4-pns2JMC&pg=PA189&dq=hud+%22reflector+sight&hl=en&ei=oxmSTeqFA8etgQeA5f0Y&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=hud%20%22reflector%20sight&f=false D. N. Jarrett, Cockpit engineering, page 189]</ref> The illuminated reticle was eventually replaced by a video screen at the focus of the collimating optics that not only gave a sighting point and information from a lead-finding computer and radar, but also various aircraft indicators (such as an artificial horizon, compass, altitude and airspeed indicators), facilitating the visual tracking of targets or the transition from instrument to visual methods during landings.

===Firearm sights===
[[File:INDIA5.jpg |thumb|right| U.S. Marine looking through a [[ITL MARS]] reflex sight on his M16A4 rifle.]]
The idea of attaching a reflector sight to a firearm has been around since the sight's invention in 1900.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=pIzpAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA353&lpg=PA353&dq=Transactions+of+the+Royal+Dublin+Society+March+20+1901&source=bl&ots=SoFiUSEcXx&sig=NG5Wek7LoxTHzY1hPxgw_Z076b0&hl=en&ei=wbGXTd-_MuGX0QGg0uz6Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=grubb&f=false The scientific transactions of the Royal Dublin]</ref>  Right after World War Two models appeared for rifles and shotguns including the Nydar shotgun sight (1945)<ref>Game breeder and sportsman: Volumes 50-52, 1945</ref>, which used a curved simi-reflective mirror to reflect an ambient lit reticle, and the Giese electric gunsight (1947), which had a battery powered illuminated reticle.<ref><U+201C>Stock Up For the Outdoors<U+201D>, Popular Science - Dec 1946- Vol. 149, No. 6  - page 150</ref> Later types included the Qwik-Point (1970)  and the Thompson Insta-Sight. Both were a beam spliter type reflector sights that used ambient light: illuminating a green crosshair in the Insta-Sight, and a red plastic rod <U+201C>[[light pipe]]<U+201D> that produced a red aiming spot reticle in the Qwik-Point .<ref>Popular Science - Sep 1971 - Page 56</ref> 
[[Image:Tasco PDP2.jpg|left|thumb|175px|A view through a Tasco ProPoint "''red dot sight''".]]
The mid to late 70s saw the introduction of what are usually referred to as "''[[Red dot sight|red dot sights]]''", a type that gives the user a simple bright red dot as an aiming point.<ref>Invention intelligence: Volume 11, Inventions Promotion Board, National Research Development Corporation of India - 1976, page 12</ref> The typical configuration for this sight is a compact curved mirror reflector design with a red [[Light-emitting diode]] (LED) at its focus. Using an LED as a reticle is an innovation that greatly improves the reliability and general usefulness of the sight. There is no need for other optical elements to focus light behind a reticle. The mirror can use a  [[Dichroic filter|dichroic]] coating to reflect just the red spectrum allowing it to pass through most other light. And the LED its self is [[solid state]] and consumes very little power, allowing battery powered sights to run for hundreds and even tens of thousands hours.

Reflector sights for military firearms (usually referred to by the abbreviation <U+201C>''reflex sight''<U+201D>) took a long time to be adopted. The US House Committee on Armed Services noted as far back as 1975 on the suitability of the use of reflex sight for the M16<ref>Hearings before and special reports made by Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives on subjects affecting the naval and military establishments, Volume 980 - Page 3002 United States. Congress. House. Committee on Armed Services - Political Science <U+2013> 1975. -snippet- ''Field tests indicate that, when used by a cross-section of poor, average, and good shooters, this sight will increase hit probability on stationary targets up to 30%, increase hit probability when firing from a moving vehicle or other unstable platform, and reduce training time. The reflex sighting system has universal application to small arms weapons''</ref> but the US military did not introduce a reflector sights until 2000 with the [[Aimpoint CompM2]] red dot sight, designated the <U+201C>M68 Close Combat Optic<U+201D>

====Reticle types====
Many reticle illumination and pattern options are available. Common light sources used in firearm reflector sights include [[battery (electricity)|battery]] powered lights, [[fiber optic]] light collectors, and even [[tritium]] capsules. Some sights are specifically designed to be visible when viewed through [[night vision devices]]. The color of a sight reticle is often red or amber for visibility against most backgrounds. Some sights use a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] or triangular pattern instead, to aid precision aiming and range estimation, and still others provide selectable pattern. 
[[File:PS90_sky.jpg|thumb|right|175px|A Ring Sights MC-10-80 integrated into the [[FN PS90]]]]
Sights that use dot reticles are almost invariably measured in [[minute of angle|minutes of angle]], or "MOA". MOA is a convenient measure for shooters using [[English unit]]s, since 1 MOA subtends approximately 1.0472&nbsp;inches at a distance of 100 yards (91.44 m).  This is generally rounded to 1&nbsp;inch at 100 yards, which makes MOA a handy unit to use in [[ballistics]].  The 5 MOA (1.5 mrad) dot is small enough not to obscure most targets, and large enough to quickly acquire a proper "sight picture".  For many types of [[action shooting]], a larger dot is preferred;  7 (2.0 mrad), 10 (2.9 mrad), 15 (4.4 mrad) or even 20 MOA (5.8 mrad) dots or rings are used; often these will be combined with horizontal and/or vertical lines to provide a level reference.
 
Most sights have either active or passive adjustments for the reticle brightness, which help the shooter adapt to different lighting conditions. A very dim reticle will help prevent loss of [[night vision]] in low-light conditions, while a brighter reticle will display more clearly in full sunlight.

==== Configurations ====
Modern optical reflector sights designed for firearms and other uses fall into two housing-configurations: ''tubed'' and ''open''.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=bFkL5Kyl8GQC&pg=PT143&dq=types+of+red+dot+sight++open&hl=en&ei=uZYPTs2PONOugQffw8XjDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=types%20of%20red%20dot%20sight%20%20open&f=false Thomas McIntyre, The Field & Stream Hunting Optics Handbook, page 130]</ref>

* '''Tube sights''' look similar to standard [[telescopic sight]]s, with a cylindrical tube containing the optics. Many tube sights offer the option of interchangeable filters (such as [[Polarization (waves)|polarizing]] or [[UV filter|haze-reducing filters]]), glare-reducing [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sunshade sunshades], and conveniently protective "flip-up" lens covers.

* '''Open sights''' (also known as "mini reflex sights" and "mini red dots") take advantage of the fact that reflector sights only optical element, the optical window, doesn<U+2019>t need  any housing at all.  This configuration consisting of a base with just the necessary reflective surface for collimating the reticle mounted on it. Due to their diminished profile, open sights do not usually accommodate filters and other accessory options typically supported by tube designs.

==Other uses==
[[File:Telrad hinten.jpg|right|thumb|The Telrad, a reflector sight for telescopes.]]
Reflector sights are also used on some [[telescope]]s, to help aim the telescope at the desired object. Albada type sights are used on "Point and shoot" type [[camera]]s and on simple disposable cameras.<ref>[http://www.hineslab.com/Lensless_Viewfinder.html The Hines Lensless Optical Viewfinder]</ref> They have also been used in nautical navigation devices and surveying equipment.

==Similar types==
* [[Collimator sight]]s (also called collimating<ref>William C Farmer, Ordnance field guide, page 279</ref> or "occluded eye gunsight" (OEG))<ref>Jan Kay, International Defense Directory, 1991-92, page 241</ref> are simply the optical collimator focusing a reticle without any optical window. The viewer cannot see through them and only sees an image of the reticle. They are used either with both eyes open wile one looks into the sight, with one eye open and moving the head to alternately see the sight and then at the target, or using one eye to partially see the sight and target at the same time.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=kMQqAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA84&dq=Collimator+sight&hl=en&ei=bsuMTcvHBoOJ0QH0g7m7Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Collimator%20sight&f=false  Elementary optics and applications to fire control instruments: May, 1921 By United States. Army. Ordnance Dept, page 84]</ref> The reticle is illuminated by a bulb or a passive ambient light source.  

* [[Holographic weapon sight]]s are similar in layout to reflector sights but do not use a projected reticle system. Instead a representative reticle is recorded in [[three-dimensional space]] onto [[Holography| holographic]] film at the time of manufacture. This image is part of the optical viewing window. The recorded hologram is illuminated by a collimated [[laser]] built into the sight.
