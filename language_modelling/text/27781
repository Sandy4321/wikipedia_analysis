'''''Leptoxis ampla''''', common name '''Round rocksnail''', is a [[species]] of freshwater [[snail]] with a gill and an [[operculum (gastropod)|operculum]], an [[aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[gastropod]] [[mollusk]] in the family [[Pleuroceridae]].

This species is [[Endemism|endemic]] to the [[United States]], specifically the state of [[Alabama]]. The snail has been listed as threatened on the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species]] since October 28 1998.<ref>Fish and Wildlife Service. (October 28) 1998. [http://www.fws.gov/endangered/pdfs/FR/f981028.pdf ''Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Endangered Status for Three Aquatic Snails, and Threatened Status for Three Aquatic Snails in the Mobile River Basin of Alabama'']. Federal Register, Vol. 63, No. 208, Rules and Regulations, Accessed 26 January 2009.</ref>

''Leptoxis ampla'' is vulnerable species according to the IUCN Red list,<ref name="Leptoxis"/> but its synonym ''Elimia ampla'' is written as critically endangered species according to the IUCN Red list.<ref>Bogan, A.E. 1996. [http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/7582/all ''Elimia ampla''].   [http://www.iucnredlist.org 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.] Downloaded on 06 August 2007.</ref>

== Description ==
The round rocksnail is a pleurocerid snail and its [[gastropod shell|shell]] grows to about 20 mm (0.8 in) in length. The shell is subglobose, with an ovately rounded [[aperture (mollusc)|aperture]]. The [[body whorl]] is shouldered at the [[suture (gastropod)|suture]], and may be ornamented with folds or plicae. Color may be yellow, dark brown, or olive green, usually with four entire or broken bands (Goodrich 1922).<ref name="plan"/>

Lydeard et al. (1997) found slight differences in [[DNA sequencing]] between the [[painted rocksnail]] and the round rocksnail, and considered them to be [[sister species]]. Following analysis by [[allozyme]] [[electrophoresis]] on these same species, Dillon (in litt., 1997) speculated that the two species represented isolated [[population]]s belonging to a single species. The two species are [[Geographical isolation|geographically separated]], with the painted rocksnail inhabiting [[Coosa River]] tributaries, while the round rocksnail is the only surviving rocksnail species in the [[Cahaba River]] drainage. Both species are currently recognized by the malacological community (e.g., Burch ,1989; Turgeon et al., 1998).<ref name="plan"/>

== Distribution ==
The round rocksnail was historically found in the [[Cahaba River]] and the [[Little Cahaba River]], [[Bibb County, Alabama]]; and the [[Coosa River]], [[Elmore County, Alabama]], and tributaries<U+2014>[[Big Canoe]] and [[Kelly's creek]]s, [[St. Clair County, Alabama]]; [[Ohatchee Creek]], [[Calhoun County, Alabama]]; [[Yellowleaf Creek]], [[Shelby County, Alabama]]; and [[Waxahatchee Creek]], Shelby/[[Chilton County, Alabama|Chilton counties, Alabama]] (Goodrich, 1922).<ref name="plan"/>

The round rocksnail is currently known from a shoal series in the Cahaba River, Bibb and Shelby counties, Alabama, and from the lower reach of the Little Cahaba River, and the lower reaches of Shade and Six-mile creeks in Bibb County, Alabama (Bogan and Pierson, 1993b).<ref name="plan"/>

== Reasons for the decline ==
{{main|Environmental impacts of dams}}

The Painted rocksnail has disappeared from more than 90 percent of its historic range. The curtailment of habitat and range for this (and few other snail species) species in the [[Mobile River|Mobile]] Basin's larger rivers (Coosa River, Alabama River and Cahaba River for Painted rocksnail) is primarily due to extensive construction of [[dam]]s, and the subsequent [[inundation]] of the snail's shoal habitats by the impounded waters. This snail has disappeared from all portions of its historic habitats that have been impounded by dams.<ref name="plan"/>

Dams change such areas by eliminating or reducing currents, and thus allowing sediments to accumulate on inundated channel habitats. Impounded waters also experience changes in water chemistry, which could affect survival or reproduction of riverine snails. For example, many reservoirs in the Basin currently experience eutrophic (enrichment of a water body with nutrients) conditions, and chronically low dissolved oxygen levels.<ref>Alabama Department of Environmental Management. 1994.

''Water quality report to Congress for calendar years 1994 and 1995''.

== Ecology ==

===  Habitat ===
Rocksnails are gill breathing snails found attached to cobble, gravel, or other hard substrates in the strong currents of riffles and shoals.<ref name="plan"/>

=== Life cycle ===
Adult rocksnails move very little, and females probably glue their eggs to stones in the same habitat (Goodrich, 1922). Longevity in the round rocksnail
is unknown; however, Heller (1990) reported a short life span (less than 2 years) in a Tennessee River rocksnail.<ref name="plan"/>
