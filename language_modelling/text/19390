It was written and produced by [[Evan Rogers]] and [[Carl Sturken]]. It was recorded at The Loft Recording Studios in [[Bronxville, New York]] and at [[Conway Recording Studios]] in [[Hollywood, California]]. A multitude of musicians and instruments were used for the song's instrumental, which includes piano, guitar, cello, percussion, violo and strings. "A Million Miles Away" is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Pop music|pop]] [[ballad]], which also incorporates elements of [[dance-pop]] and [[Urban music|urban]]. The song garnered a mixed reaction from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. While some critics praised Rihanna for avoiding a [[sophomore slump]] by having better material than her debut album, ''[[Music of the Sun]]'' (2005), others criticized the song for being bland. In November 2009, three and a half years after the release of ''A Girl like Me'', "A Million Miles Away" charted at number 38 on the Spanish singles chart, although Rihanna had released two albums since its release, ''[[Good Girl Gone Bad]]'' (2007) and ''[[Rated R (Rihanna album)|Rated R]]'' (2009).

==Critical reception==
Dan Charnas for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' was complimentary of Rihanna's ability to avoid a "sophomore slump" with ''A Girl like Me'' by including songs on the album which were just as good, if not better, than songs present on her debut album ''[[Music of the Sun]]'' (2005).<ref name="TWPReview"/> He wrote that she "digs into some pretty ambitious pop ballads" and wrote that "A Million Miles Away" would become a song "tangled" by future ''[[American Idol|American Idols]]''.<ref name="TWPReview"/> Quentin B. Huff for [[Popmatters]] was critical of the song, writing that "A Million Miles Away", along with "[[Unfaithful (song)|Unfaithful]]", were not as good as "Final Goodbye", writing {{" '}}Final Goodbye' has more going for it than 'Unfaithful' or the final ballad, 'A Million Miles Away'."<ref name="PopMattersReview">{{cite web|last=Huff|first=Quentin B.|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/rihanna-a-girl-like-me/|title=Review: A Girl Like Me|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|date=April 25, 2006|accessdate=A 2012}}</ref> He continued to admit that although "A Million Miles Away" and "Unfaithful" were not "bad songs", he stated "Rihanna best demonstrates her immense talent when she plays to her strength with songs that favor her island roots."<ref name="PopMattersReview"/> Spencer D. for [[IGN]] wrote that "A Million Miles Away" was one of the songs on the album which follows a "somewhat standard New School R&B tactic", and that it is a "straight ahead contemporary ballad."<ref name="IGN"/> He continued to say that Rihanna sounds better when she restrains her voice instead of pushing it to her limit.<ref name="IGN"/> Sal Cinquemani for [[Slant Magazine]] was critical of the song, along with "Final Goodbye", writing that they are "gooey and spineless slow numbers" which "kill whatever momentum the album has."<ref name="Slant">{{cite news|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/rihanna-a-girl-like-me/794|title=Rihanna: A Girl Like Me|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=April 24, 2006|accessdate=August 14, 2012}}</ref>
