'''Cyclone Hollanda''' was the worst [[tropical cyclone]] in [[Mauritius]] in 19&nbsp;years. It formed on February&nbsp;6, 1994, in the central Indian Ocean in the southern hemisphere. The cyclone moved southwestward for much of its duration, striking Mauritius on February&nbsp;10 at peak intensity with winds of 155&nbsp;km/h (100&nbsp;mph). It later passed just southeast of [[R<U+00E9>union]] before turning to the south and weakening. The cyclone became extratropical on February&nbsp;14 in the southern Indian Ocean.

On Mauritius, Hollanda destroyed or severely damaged 450&nbsp;houses, which left at least 1,500&nbsp;people homeless. High winds left half of the island without power, and also caused severe crop damage; nearly half of the island's sugar crop was destroyed, which necessitated for the government to assist in replanting efforts. Hollanda killed 2&nbsp;people and caused $135&nbsp;million in damage on Mauritius. About a week after the cyclone struck, [[1990<U+2013>95 Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone seasons#Tropical Cyclone Ivy|Cyclone Ivy]] also affected the area, although to a lesser degree. The highest rainfall from the cyclone fell on R<U+00E9>union, with {{convert|741|mm|in|abbr=on}} recorded at [[Grand Coude, R<U+00E9>union|Grand Coude]].

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Hollanda 1994 track.png}}
Based on analysis from [[M<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>o-France]] (MFR), a disturbance in the Indian Ocean [[intertropical convergence zone]] became evident south of the [[Chagos Archipelago]] on February&nbsp;6, after [[Cyclone Geralda]] struck [[Madagascar]] and moved away from the region.<ref name="mfo"/> The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) assessed it as developing a day prior in the same general area.<ref name="jtwc">{{cite web|publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|accessdate=2011-10-02|title=Cyclone Hollanda Best Track|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/best_tracks/1994/1994s-bsh/bsh151994.txt}}</ref> Later on February&nbsp;6, a [[atmospheric circulation|circulation]] developed concurrently with an area of organized [[convection (meteorology)|convection]]. On February&nbsp;8, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Hollanda as it moved southwestward, its motion influenced by a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to its south. A [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] turned the storm to the south-southwest, and Hollanda intensified into a [[tropical cyclone scales#France and the South-West Indian Ocean|tropical cyclone]]&nbsp;<U+2013> the equivalence of a hurricane&nbsp;<U+2013> on February&nbsp;9.<ref name="mfo"/>

After becoming a tropical cyclone, Hollanda developed a small {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] as it tracked toward the island of [[Mauritius]], located east of Madagascar. Continuing to intensify, the cyclone struck the northern coast of the island at 1800&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on February&nbsp;10 at peak intensity,<ref name="mfo"/> with winds of 155&nbsp;km/h (100&nbsp;mph) (10&nbsp;minute [[maximum sustained wind|sustained wind]]s) as assessed by MFR.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=M<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>o-France|year=2004|title=Donnees De Hollanda|language=French|accessdate=2011-10-04|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20041103220856/http://www.meteo.fr/temps/domtom/La_Reunion/base_cyclone/nom_annee/HOLLANDA_1993.html}}</ref> In addition, the cyclone produced [[gust]]s to {{convert|230|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref name="mfo"/> At the same time, the JTWC estimated peak winds of 195&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph) (1&nbsp;minute sustained winds).<ref name="jtwc"/> While moving over Mauritius, the eye became disrupted, although Hollanda maintained much of its intensity as it passed just southeast of [[R<U+00E9>union]] early on February&nbsp;11. The cyclone remained well-defined as it moved more poleward, and an irregular eye remained visible on satellite imagery. On February&nbsp;13, Hollanda turned eastward due to a trough, and the next day it became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] over the southern Indian Ocean. Its remnants persisted at least two more days.<ref name="mfo">{{cite web|author=Guy Le Goff|year=1994|publisher=M<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>o-France|title=1993-1994 Cyclone Season in the South-West Indian Ocean|accessdate=2011-10-02|url=http://www.meteo.fr/temps/domtom/La_Reunion/webcmrs9.0/anglais/archives/publications/saisons_cycloniques/index19931994.html}}</ref>

==Impact==
Before Hollanda struck Mauritius, most people were already residing at home, due to the cyclone striking during the [[Chinese New Year]].<ref name="rw">{{cite web|author=United Nations Department of Human Affairs|publisher=[[ReliefWeb]]|year=1994|title=Mauritius&nbsp;<U+2014> Cyclones Hollanda/Ivy Feb 1994 UN DHA Situation Reports 1-5|accessdate=2011-10-02|url=http://reliefweb.int/node/35539}}</ref> Officials closed the airport prior to the cyclone's arrival, and most stores and banks were also closed.

Ultimately, Cyclone Hollanda made landfall at peak intensity, producing wind gusts of {{convert|216|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in Mauritius's capital city of [[Port Louis]].<ref name="mfo"/> Strong winds affected the northern and western portions of the island, particularly near the coast, and the cyclone was considered the worst to hit there since Cyclone Gervaise in 1975.<ref name="rw"/> In addition to the winds, the storm dropped torrential rainfall that reached {{convert|711|mm|in|abbr=on}} in [[Mare aux Vacoas]].<ref name="mfo"/> Across the island, Hollanda destroyed 290&nbsp;houses and severely damaged another 160, which left at least 1,500&nbsp;people homeless.<ref name="rw"/> Included among the damaged buildings was the [[Mauritius<U+2013>Russia relations|Russian embassy]], which faced such difficulties making repairs that the ambassadors moved their offices.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Indian Ocean Newsletter|date=1994-03-19|title=Mauritius: Red is the Russian face|accessdate=2011-10-03|number=615}}</ref> Damage to schools was estimated at 25&nbsp;million [[Mauritian rupee|rupees]] ($1.3&nbsp;million 1994&nbsp;USD),<ref name="ion219">{{cite news|newspaper=Indian Ocean Newsletter|date=1994-02-19|title=Mauritius: Cyclone slams recovery|number=611|accessdate=2011-10-03}}</ref> causing some to be closed for as long as 12&nbsp;days.<ref>{{cite news|author=B<U+00E9>atrice Hope|date=2009-08-29|title=La GTU ne souhaite pas un report des examens du CPE|publisher=Lexpress.mu|accessdate=2011-10-03|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/story/5524-la-gtu-ne-souhaite-pas-un-report-des-examens-du-cpe.html}}</ref> High winds downed 30% of the island's trees.<ref name="ion219"/> Many fell onto power lines,<ref name="rw"/> which left 60% of Mauritians without power and about half without telephone service.<ref name="ion219"/> All external communications were cut to the country during the cyclone.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jochen Zschau|author2=Andreas N.

Although the cyclone did not strike the island of R<U+00E9>union, Hollanda produced strong wind gusts that peaked at {{convert|234|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in [[Sainte-Rose, R<U+00E9>union|Sainte-Rose]]. Rainfall on the island peaked at {{convert|741|mm|in|abbr=on}} at [[Grand Coude, R<U+00E9>union|Grand Coude]]. The cyclone left damage to crops, power systems, telephones, and the water network, mostly due to the strong winds.<ref name="mfo"/>
