'''Westgate-on-Sea''' is a seaside town in northeast [[Kent]], [[England]], with a population of 6,600. It is within the [[Thanet (district)|Thanet]] [[Districts of England|local government district]] and borders the larger seaside resort of [[Margate]]. Its two sandy beaches have remained a popular tourist attraction since the town's development in the 1860s from a small farming community.

The town is notable for once being the location of a [[Royal Naval Air Service]] seaplane base, which defended the [[Thames Estuary]] coastal towns during [[World War I]]. The town is the subject of Sir [[John Betjeman]]'s poem, ''Westgate-on-Sea''. Residents have included the 19th century surgeon Sir [[William James Erasmus Wilson|Erasmus Wilson]] and former [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[William Temple (archbishop)|William Temple]]. The artist Sir [[William Quiller Orchardson]] painted several of his most well-known pictures while living in Westgate-on-Sea. The British composer [[Arnold Cooke]] attended the town's Streete Preparatory School in the early 1900s.

==History==
Before the 1860s, Westgate consisted of only a farm and a few cottages. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after [[Mildrith]], Thanet's [[patron saint]] and a onetime [[Abbess]] of [[Minster-in-Thanet|Minster]]. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the middle-classes.<ref name="oldm">{{cite book  | title = Old Margate| last=Mirams| first=Michael| publisher = Maresborough Books| date = 1984 }}</ref> A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and a housing estate was built with the intention that the resort would benefit its residents rather than occasional tourists.<ref name="britsea">{{cite book  | title = The British Seaside: Holidays and Resorts in the Twentieth Century (Studies in Popular Culture)|date=2000 | publisher =Manchester University Press| isbn=071905169X }}</ref><ref name="gunter">{{cite web  | title = The Boltons and Redcliffe Square area - The Gunter estate, 1864-78| publisher = British History Online| url =http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=50024  | accessdate = 2001-05-28 }}</ref> The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population,<ref name="oldm"/> which reached 2,738 by 1901.<ref name="vision">{{cite web  | title = A vision of Westgate on Sea CP | publisher = VisionOfBritain.org.uk| url = http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10228591  | accessdate = 2007-05-28 }}</ref> The demands of the increasing population led to the building of St. James' Church in 1872, and St. Saviour's Church in 1885.<ref name="stjames">{{cite web  | title = An Abbreviated History   | publisher = St. James' Church | url = http://www.stjameswestgate.org.uk/page5history.htm  | accessdate = 2007-04-22 }}</ref> In 1884, it was reported that [[Essex]], on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a [[Earthquake|tremor]] so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Weather: this week in history  | publisher = BBC| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/weather/history/weeklyfacts17.shtml  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref> In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to [[Coutts]] Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.<ref>{{cite web  | title = The Boltons and Redcliffe Square area: The area after 1878  | publisher = British-History.ac.uk| url =http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=50025 | accessdate = 2007-05-29 }}</ref><ref name="britsea"/>

Around twenty schools were opened during the late 1800s, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House and St Michael's School.<ref name="census1881">{{cite book | title = Census Returns of England and Wales, 1881 Public Record Office RG11 Pieces 983-985}}</ref><ref name="census1891">{{cite book | title = Census Returns of England and Wales, 1891 Public Record Office RG12 Pieces 725-726}}</ref><ref name="census1901">{{cite book | title = Census Returns of England and Wales, 1901 Public Record Office RG13 Piece 820}}</ref> Streete Court School was opened in 1894 by John Vine Milne, the father of the author [[A.

On [[1 August]] [[1914]], after the outbreak of [[World War I]], a Royal Navy seaplane base was opened by the coast to defend the Thames Estuary naval towns against attack. It was at first used for both seaplanes and landplanes, but due to landing problems, a separate landplane base was opened in [[Manston, Kent|Manston]] in 1916. After the war, the seaplane base was decommissioned, and the landplane base in Manston eventually became [[Kent International Airport]].<ref name="seaplane">{{cite web  | title = Kent International Airport  | publisher = AirportGuides.co.uk| url = http://www.airportguides.co.uk/guides/kent-international/  | accessdate = 2007-05-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book  | title = Military Airfields of Britain: South East Kent,Hampshire,Surrey,Sussex|date=2005| publisher =The Crowood Press | pages=266 |isbn=1861267290 }}</ref> During the war, the Coronation Bandstand was converted into sleeping quarters for use by the Royal West Kent Regiment.

In 1975, five historic church bells were transferred to St Saviour's Church from the Holy Cross Church in Canterbury, which had closed in 1972.

==Geography==
[[Image:Epple Bay, with Westgate on Sea in the distance.jpg|right|thumb|A view of Westgate-on-Sea from the neighbouring village of [[Birchington-on-Sea]]]]
Westgate-on-Sea is located at {{coor dms|51|22|60|N|1|20|07|E|city}} (51.3832, 1.3353) in northeast Kent, on the coast of the Thames Estuary. It is bordered by the town of Margate to the east and the village of [[Birchington-on-Sea]] to the west. The town is built beside the two sandy bays of St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, which both have a [[sea wall]] and [[groyne]]s to prevent coastal flooding. Chalk cliffs are present in between the bays and either side of the bays. The whole of the northeast Kent coast has been designated a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]].<ref>{{cite web  | title = Geological Sites Map | publisher = Natureonthemap.org.uk | url = http://www.natureonthemap.org.uk/map.aspx  | accessdate = 2007-04-24 }}</ref> 

The town is situated on the [[Isle of Thanet]], a separate island from mainland Kent until around two hundred years ago, when the channel in between silted up. The geology of Thanet consists mainly of chalk, deposited when the area was below the sea. Isle of Thanet became exposed above sea-level once the [[English Channel]] broke through between Kent and France, causing the sea-level to fall.<ref name="Isle of Thanet">{{cite web  | title = Isle of Thanet    | publisher = BBC | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/content/articles/2006/05/15/thanet_history_feature.shtml  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref>
