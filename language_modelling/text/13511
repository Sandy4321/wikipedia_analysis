'''Robert Clive Napper''' (born 25 February 1966) is a convicted [[British people|British]] [[serial killer]] and [[rapist]] who was remanded in [[Broadmoor Hospital]] indefinitely on 18 December 2008 for the manslaughter of [[Rachel Nickell murder case|Rachel Nickell]] on 15 July 1992. He was previously convicted of the 1993 double murder of Samantha Bisset and her daughter Jazmine.<ref name="Times">Sean O'Neill and Adam Fresco  [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article5365060.ece "Inside the mind of Robert Napper",] ''The Times'', 18 December 2008.</ref>

He is a [[Schizophrenia|paranoid schizophrenic]] who has also been diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome|Asperger's syndrome]].<ref name="Times"/>

==Early life==
Robert Napper is the oldest child of Brian Napper, a driving instructor, and his wife Pauline.<ref name="Times"/> Born in [[Erith]], [[Greater London]], Napper was raised in [[Plumstead]], [[South East (London sub region)|South East London]] in his early years. His background was troubled and dysfunctional. The marriage of his parents was violent and Napper witnessed violent attacks on his mother. His parents divorced when he was 10 and he and his siblings (two brothers and a sister) were placed in foster care and underwent psychiatric treatment.<ref name="Laville">Sandra Laville [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/dec/18/robert-napper-clues "Nickell murder: Missed clues that allowed Napper to kill again",] ''The Guardian'', 18 December 2008.</ref> The psychiatric counselling Napper had at the [[Maudsley Hospital]] in Camberwell lasted for six years.

At age 12, Napper underwent a personality change after a family friend sexually assaulted him on a camping holiday. The offender was jailed,<ref name="Telegraph">Richard Edwards, Murray Wardrop and David Millward [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3813236/Rachel-Nickell-Profile-of-killer-Robert-Napper.html "Rachel Nickell: Profile of killer Robert Napper",] ''Daily Telegraph'', 18 December 2008.</ref> but Napper became introverted, obsessively tidy and reclusive according to his mother.<ref name="Laville"/> He also bullied his siblings and spied on his sister while she undressed.

==Criminal activities==
In 1986, Napper first came to police attention after being convicted of an offence with an airgun.<ref name="Laville"/> In October 1989,<ref name="Independent">Shenai Raif [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/rachels-killer-caught-by-new-dna-techniques-1203073.html "Rachel's killer caught by new DNA techniques"], Press Association report reproduced on ''The Independent'' website, 18 December 2008</ref> police had rejected information conveyed in a phonecall from Napper's mother that her son had admitted to perpetrating a rape on Plumstead Common. No case apparently matched the evidence. However, it emerged at the time of Napper's second conviction, that a rape of a 30-year-old woman, in front of her children, eight weeks earlier, had been reported to have occurred in a house which backed on to Plumstead Common. At this point, Pauline Napper broke off all contact with her son.<ref name="Laville"/>

On 15 July 1992 on [[Wimbledon Common]], Napper stabbed the young mother [[Rachel Nickell murder case|Rachel Nickell]] forty-nine times in front of her son Alex, then aged two, who clung on to his mother's body begging her to wake up. Napper was questioned about unsolved attacks on women during the year, but was eliminated from inquiries.<ref name="Indie">[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/rachel-nickells-killer-finally-brought-to-justice-1203036.html "Rachel Nickell's killer finally brought to justice",] ''The Independent'', 18 December 2008</ref> 

In November 1993, in the Bisset home in [[Plumstead]], [[South East (London sub region)|South East London]], Napper stabbed 27-year-old Samantha Bisset in her neck and chest, killing her, and then sexually assaulted<ref>Richard Edwards [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3832069/Rachel-Nickell-Mistakes-allowed-Robert-Napper-to-kill-Samantha-and-Jazmine-Bisset.html Rachel Nickell: Mistakes allowed Robert Napper to kill Samantha and Jazmine Bisset",] ''Daily Telegraph'', 18 December 2008.</ref> and smothered her four-year-old daughter, Jazmine Jemima Bisset.<ref name="Independent"/><ref>[http://www.findmypast.com/BirthsMarriagesDeaths.jsp Births and Deaths England and Wales 1984-2006]</ref> In her sitting room, the 6' 2" Napper mutilated Samantha's body. He even took away part of her body as a trophy. The police photographer was off work for two years from the impact of witnessing the murder scene.<ref name="Independent"/> 

After a fingerprint belonging to Napper was recovered from Samantha's flat, he was arrested, and charged with the murders of Samantha and Jazmine Bisset, in May 1994. Napper was convicted at the [[Old Bailey]] in October 1995. He also admitted two rapes and two attempted rapes at this time.<ref name="BBC">Sarah White [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7697876.stm "Killer who slipped through the net"], BBC News, 18 December 2008.</ref> From the time of the first Old Bailey trial, he has been held at [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor]]. In December 1995 he was questioned about Nickell's death but denied any involvement.<ref name="Indie"/> 

Napper is also believed to be the "Green Chain Rapist", who carried out at least 70 savage attacks across south-east London over a four-year period ending in 1994. The earliest of the 'Green Chain' rapes have been linked to Napper, and were those he admitted to in 1995.<ref name="Laville"/> Napper is known to have kept detailed records of the sites of potential and actual attacks on women.

The investigation to find Nickell's murderer resulted in the attempted prosecution of an innocent man, Colin Stagg, until, in 2004, advances in DNA profiling revealed Napper's connection to the case. On 18 December 2008, Napper was convicted of the [[manslaughter]] of Rachel Nickell on the grounds of [[diminished responsibility]]. He also admitted to four other attacks on women.<ref name="BBC"/>

Napper was to be held indefinitely at Broadmoor Hospital. At the same time, Colin Stagg received a public apology from the police.

In his summing up at the Old Bailey, Mr Justice Griffiths Williams said to Napper: "You are on any view a very dangerous man".<ref>Sandra Laville, et al.
