The '''City of Lafayette''' {{IPAc-en|<U+02CC>|l|<U+0251><U+02D0>|f|e<U+026A>|<U+02C8>|<U+025B>|t}} is a [[Colorado municipalities#Home Rule Municipality|Home Rule Municipality]] located in [[Boulder County, Colorado|Boulder County]], [[Colorado]], [[United States]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 24,453.<ref name="Census 2010">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US0841835| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Lafayette city, Colorado| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=September 26, 2013}}</ref>

== Geography ==
Lafayette is located in southeastern Boulder County at {{coord|39|59|42|N|105|6|2|W|type:city}} (39.995, -105.100556).{{GR|1}} It is bordered by the town of [[Erie, Colorado|Erie]] to the north and east, by the city of [[Broomfield, Colorado|Broomfield]] to the east and south, and by [[Louisville, Colorado|Louisville]] to the southwest. [[U.S. Route 287 in Colorado|U.S. Highway 287]] is the main road through the city, leading north to [[Longmont, Colorado|Longmont]] and south to Broomfield and [[Denver]]. [[Colorado State Highway 7|State Highway 7]] leads east from Lafayette to [[Brighton, Colorado|Brighton]] and west to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Lafayette has a total area of {{convert|24.9|sqkm|disp=flip}}, of which {{convert|24.5|km2|disp=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.4|km2|disp=flip}}, or 1.50%, is water.<ref name="Census 2010"/>

==History==
Lafayette was founded in 1878 by Mary Miller. She and her husband, Lafayette Miller, had moved to the area to farm land acquired via the [[Homestead Act]] in 1871. In 1874 the Millers moved to Boulder. Lafayette Miller ran a butcher shop and was a town trustee. Lafayette Miller died in 1878, after which Mary Miller moved back to the farm with their six small children. In 1884 [[coal]] was discovered on the Miller farm, and in 1887 John Simpson sank the first shaft, thereby starting the coal mining era. In 1888 Mary Miller designated {{convert|150|acre|km2}} of the farm for the town of Lafayette, which she named after her late husband. In July 1888 a second mine, the Cannon, went into operation and the first houses were built. On January 6, 1890,<ref name=MuniIncCO/> the town of Lafayette was incorporated. As stipulated in the original town deeds, no [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] was sold east of what is now known as Public Road.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cityoflafayette.com/Page.asp?NavID=316| title=History of Lafayette| publisher=City of Lafayette| accessdate=2007-02-01}}</ref><ref name="marymiller">{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflafayette.com/Page.asp?NavID=371| title=Mary Miller| publisher=City of Lafayette| accessdate=2007-02-01}}</ref>

Lafayette quickly became a part of the coal-mining boom that all of eastern Boulder and southwestern [[Weld County, Colorado|Weld]] counties were experiencing, with the Cannon and Simpson mines being the largest and most productive. By 1914 Lafayette was a booming town with two banks, four hotels, and a brickworks. Lafayette was also the location of a power station that served Louisville, Boulder, Longmont, and [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]].

Mary Miller continued to be a leader in the community, especially in January 1900, when the town burned. She founded the Miller Bank in 1892, and it became the Lafayette Bank in 1902.<ref name="marymiller"/> She was elected president of the bank, and at that time was the only woman bank president in the world. The bank closed in 1914 because of roughly $90,000 in bad loans to the [[United Mine Workers]]. She remained devoted to the [[temperance movement]] and eventually ran for state treasurer on the Prohibition ticket. Miller died in 1921 at her daughter-in-law's home at 501 E. Cleveland Street.

Lafayette continued to thrive as a coal-mining town. Many miners struck in the aforementioned strike in the 1910s, which was nationally recognized as a great Wobbly ([[Industrial Workers of the World]]; a radical labor group) strike; noted for the [[Ludlow Massacre]] of miners' families by the National Guard in the Southern Coal Field near [[Trinidad, Colorado]].

In 1927, Lafayette's coal miners struck again. This time, the mining massacre was closer to home, resulting in the deaths of five Lafayette resident miners just northeast of town in the [[Columbine Mine Massacre]] on November 27, 1927, in what is now the ghost town of [[Serene, Colorado|Serene]] near [[Erie, Colorado|Erie]].

Strangely, it was another female financier who came to the miners' aid. [[Josephine Roche]], the daughter of the anti-labor deceased owner of the [[Rocky Mountain Fuel Company]] (RMFC) that owned many of the mines in the Lafayette area, used some shares of the company she had inherited from her father, bought a controlling interest in the company, and immediately began the most labor-friendly mine operation in the United States. She went on to be a top assistant to [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[Secretary of Labor]], [[Frances Perkins]]. Back in Lafayette, life became much better for the coal miners with the more labor-friendly management of the RMFC.

Coal mining declined as an industry by the 1950s as [[natural gas]] replaced coal. The Black Diamond mine closed in 1956, and Lafayette became once more an agriculture-based community. As Denver and Boulder grew, residential growth in Lafayette increased. With the increase in residential growth, the farm-based economy changed and commercial, small industrial and manufacturing factors became more important.

==Today==
The Lafayette City Council serves as the community's legislative body, enacting ordinances, appropriating funds to conduct city business, and providing policy direction for city governance through the city administrator. The Council consists of seven members who are elected on a non-partisan basis in odd-numbered years. Terms are staggered as four seats must be filled each election year. The three councilors with the highest number of votes serve four-year terms and the fourth receives a two-year term.  The mayor and mayor pro-tem are selected by the City Council for two-year terms. The current mayor of Lafayette is Christine Berg and the mayor pro-tem is Gustavo Reyna.<ref>http://cityoflafayette.com/index.aspx?nid=247</ref>

2010 saw several empty [[big-box store]]s on South Boulder Road sign leases. Jax Sporting Goods moved into the old Ace Hardware building on the corner of S. Boulder and Highway 287, and next door Sunflower Market opened a new store where [[Albertsons (supermarket)|Albertsons]] previously was housed.

Lafayette hosts a variety of unique events each year, including an [[oatmeal]] festival in cooperation with the [[Quaker Oats Company]], a peach festival, a wine festival, and Lafayette Days.  Festival Plaza is a gathering place in Old Town Lafayette on Public Road and Chester Streets. The Plaza is composed of a series of four smaller interconnected plazas each designed with features to promote various events.

==Education==
Lafayette public schools are part of the Boulder Valley School District. The main public high school in Lafayette is [[Centaurus High School]], which has approximately 1,000 students. [[Peak to Peak Charter School]] offers kindergarten through high school. The public middle school is Angevine Middle School. This school feeds into Centaurus and is also very diverse. The elementary schools are Lafayette, Alicia Sanchez, Bernard D. 'Pat' Ryan STEAM school, and Pioneer Elementary, a bilingual school where English and Spanish are both spoken. [http://www.dawsonschool.org Alexander Dawson School] is a private K-12 college prep school in the north part of town.
