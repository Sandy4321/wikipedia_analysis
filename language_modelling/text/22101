The '''Great Eastern Crisis''' of '''1875-78''' began in Ottoman territories of the Balkans in 1875, with the outbreak of several uprisings and wars that resulted in the meddling of international powers, and was ended with the [[Treaty of Berlin]] in July 1878.

==Background==
{{unreferenced section}}
The state of Ottoman administration in the Balkans continued to deteriorate throughout the 19th century, with the central government occasionally losing control over whole provinces. Reforms imposed by European powers did little to improve the conditions of the Christian population, while at the same time managing to dissatisfy a sizable portion of the Muslim population. [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] suffered at least two waves of rebellion by the local Muslim population, the most recent in 1850. Austria consolidated after the turmoil of the first half of the century and sought to reinvigorate its longstanding policy of expansion at the expense of the Ottoman empire.  Meanwhile, the nominally autonomous, de facto independent principalities of [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]] also sought to expand into regions inhabited by their compatriots.  Nationalist and [[irredentism|irredentist]] sentiments were strong and were encouraged by Russia and her agents.  At the same time, a severe drought in Anatolia in 1873 and flooding in 1874 caused famine and widespread discontent in the heart of the Empire. The agricultural shortages precluded the collection of necessary taxes, which forced the Ottoman government to declare bankruptcy in October, 1875 and increase taxes on outlying provinces including the Balkans.
