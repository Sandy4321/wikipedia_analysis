The '''Chicago Race Riot of 1919''' was a major [[Mass racial violence in the United States|racial conflict]] that began in {{city-state|Chicago|Illinois}} on July 27, 1919 and ended on August 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1032.html|title=Race Riots|author=Essig, Steven|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society}}</ref>  During the riot, dozens died and hundreds were injured.<ref name=TCRR/> It is considered to be the worst of the approximately 25 [[riot]]s during the [[Red Summer of 1919]], so named because of the violence and fatalities across the nation.<ref name=CRRo19>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9023985/Chicago-Race-Riot-of-1919|accessdate=2007-08-24|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica, Inc.|date=2007|title=Chicago Race Riot of 1919}}</ref> The combination of [[arson]], looting and murder was also the worst race rioting in the history of Illinois.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=950CEED71638E13ABC4151DFB1668382609EDE|title=Street Battles at -Night|accessdate=2008-05-09|date=[[1919-08-03]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

The sociopolitical atmosphere of Chicago was filled with ethnic and racial tension caused by competition among many new groups.  With the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], thousands of [[African Americans]] from the South had settled next to ethnic neighborhoods on Chicago's [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]], near jobs in the stockyards and meatpacking plants.<ref name = ChiHI/><ref name=HiC1919/>  Post World War I tensions caused frictions between the races, especially in the competitive labor and housing markets.<ref name=CaIER/>  Overcrowding and increased African American militancy by veterans contributed to the visible racial frictions.<ref name=CRRo19/>  Also, ethnic gangs and police neglect strained the racial relationships.<ref name=CaIER/>  According to official reports, the turmoil came to a boil after a young African American was struck by a rock and died at an informally segregated beach.  Tensions between groups arose in a melee that blew up into days of unrest.<ref name=CRRo19/>

[[William Hale Thompson]] was the [[Mayor of Chicago]] during the riot and future iconic Chicago Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]] rose to prominence following the riots although he never officially acknowledged involvement in the violence.<ref name = ChiHI/>  [[United States President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] and the [[United States Congress]] attempted to promote legislation and organizations that would decrease the racial discord in America at the time.<ref name=CRRo19/>  [[Illinois Governor]] [[Frank Lowden]] took several actions at the request of Thompson to quell the riot and promote greater harmony in its aftermath.<ref name=TROiC/><ref name=SBAN/> Several sections of the Chicago economy were shut down for several days during and after the riots.<ref name=TROiC/><ref name=RiCKMC/> Thompson drew on associations with this riot to influence later political elections.<ref name=TvM/>

==Background==
[[Image:chicago-race-riot.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A white gang looking for African Americans during the Chicago Race Riot of 1919]]
Unlike [[Southern United States|southern]] cities through the 1960s, Chicago did not segregate most public accommodations.<ref name=TCRR/> In fact, according to [[Walter Francis White]], pre-1915 Chicago had a reputation for equitable treatment of African Americans in general.<ref name=CaIER>{{cite web|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/4978|accessdate=2007-08-27|year=1919|month=October|title=<U+201C>Chicago and Its Eight Reasons": Walter White Considers the Causes of the 1919 Chicago Race Riot|publisher=History Matters|work=Crisis}}</ref> However, early 20th-century [[Chicago beaches]] were segregated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/300066.html|title=Race Divisions on Public Beaches (page 1)|author=|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society}}</ref> African Americans had a long history in Chicago, with the city sending its first African-American representative to the state legislature in 1876.  There had also been late 19th century tensions between [[Irish Americans|Irish]] ethnics and African Americans, as most members of both competed among the lower classes.<ref>[http://www.chicagohistory.info/stories/daley/racism.html Adam Cohen and Elizabeth Taylor, "Richard J.

Beginning in 1910, thousands of African Americans started moving from the South to Chicago as one destination in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], fleeing [[lynching]]s, segregation and [[disfranchisement]] in states such as [[Mississippi]], [[Louisiana]] and [[Alabama]]. In the south, [[Ku Klux Klan]] held 64 [[lynching]]s in 1918 and 83 in 1919.<ref name=CRRo19/>  With the pull of industrial jobs in the [[stockyard]]s and [[meatpacking]] industry beckoning as European [[immigration]] was cut off by World War I, from 1916 to 1919 the African Americans population in Chicago increased 148 percent during the decade from 44,000 to 109,000.<ref name=HiC1919/><ref name=CRRo19/>  African Americans settled in the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]], where, as their population grew, they pressed up against a neighborhood of ethnic Irish, earlier immigrants, and had to compete against them for jobs and housing.  Southern African Americans had followed waves of immigrants from eastern Europe, who also added to the competition and tensions. Ethnic groups established strongly territorial areas in the city and their young men often patrolled against outsiders.  Because of [[agriculture|agricultural]] problems, southern whites also migrated to the city, about 20,000 by this period.<ref name=CaIER/>  The rapid influx of migrants caused overcrowding as a result of a lack of adequate housing.<ref name=CRRo19/>

The postwar period found tensions rising in numerous cities where populations were increasing rapidly.  People from different cultures jostled against each other and competed for space. In 1917, the Chicago Real Estate Board established a policy of block by block segregation.  New arrivals in the Great Migration generally joined old neighbors on the South Side, and by 1920, the area held 85% of Chicago's African Americans--[[middle class|middle]] and [[upper class]] and [[Poverty|poor]].<ref name = ChiHI>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagohistory.info/stories/daley/racism.html|title=Richard J. Daley: A Separate World (page 7), excerpt from ''American Pharaoh: Mayor Richard J. Daley - His Battle for Chicago and the Nation''|author=Adam Cohen and Elizabeth Taylor |work=Chicago History Information|date=2000|publisher=chicagohistory.info|accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> In the postwar period, veterans of all groups were looking to re-enter the work force. Some whites resented African American [[veteran]]s. At the same time, African-American veterans exhibited greater militancy and pride as a result of having served to protect their country.  They wanted to be treated as full [[citizen]]s after fighting for the nation.<ref name=CRRo19/>

In Chicago, ethnic Irish dominated social and athletic clubs that were closely tied to the political structure of the city.  Some had acted as enforcers for politicians.  They had been the first major group of 19th century European immigrants to settle in the city and had established formal and informal political strength.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/4975/|title="A Crowd of Howling Negroes": The Chicago Daily Tribune Reports the Chicago Race Riot, 1919|accessdate=2008-05-07|publisher=|work=[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]}}</ref>  In Chicago, white gangs had been attacking African Americans neighborhoods, and the white police seemed little inclined to try to stop them. Meanwhile, newspapers carried sensational accounts of any African American allegedly involved in crime.<ref name=CaIER/> An example was the [[Bridgeport, Chicago|Bridgeport]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] which was an ethnic Irish neighborhood just west of the Black Belt.  Ethnic Irish had long patrolled their neighborhood boundaries against all other ethnic groups, especially African Americans.  A group known as the [[Hamburg Athletic Club]], whose members included a 17-year-old [[Richard J. Daley]], future [[mayor of Chicago]], contributed to gang violence in the area.<ref name = ChiHI>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagohistory.info/stories/daley/racism.html|title=Richard J.

==Riot==

The riot lasted for a week and ended only after the government deployed nearly 6,000 [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] troops, putting an end to the violence on the night of July 30.<ref name=TROiC>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9F02E2DF1738E13ABC4A53DFBE668382609EDE|title=Troopers Restore Order in Chicago|accessdate=2008-05-08|date=[[1919-08-02]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Most of the rioting, murder, and [[arson]] was concentrated in the city's [[Black Belt (region of Chicago)|Black Belt]] on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]], but violent conflict occurred in areas throughout the city, including the [[Chicago Loop]].<ref name=2D5HITDRRIC>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E07E2D61638E13ABC4850DFB1668382609EDE|title=28 Dead, 500 Hurt In Three-Day Race Riots In Chicago|accessdate=2008-05-09|date=[[1919-07-30]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> The riot left 38 people dead (23 [[African American]]s and 15 [[whites]]),<ref name=TCRR>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/11045.html|title=The Chicago Race Riots, July 1919|author=Sandburg, Carl |work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Historical Society}}</ref> and 537 were injured (two-thirds African Americans).

Order was restored by an order from [[Chief of Police]] John J. Garrity which closed "all places where men congregate for other than religious purposes."  [[Illinois Governor]] [[Frank Lowden]] was urged to create a state committee to study the causation of the riots and proposed forming a committee to write a racial code of ethics and to draw up racial boundaries for activities within the city.<ref name=TROiC/>  Governor Lowden had authorized the deployment of the 11th Illinois Infantry and its [[machine gun]] company, as well as the 1st, 2nd and 3rd reserve militia.  These four units totaled 3,500 men.<ref name=SBAN>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=950CEED71638E13ABC4151DFB1668382609EDE|title=Street Battles At Night|accessdate=2008-05-09|date=[[1919-07-29]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>  The [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] [[Sheriff]] deputized between 1000 and 2000 former soldiers to help keep the peace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9507E5DD1738E13ABC4C53DFBE668382609EDE|title=Order Prevails in Chicago|accessdate=2008-05-09|date=[[1919-08-03]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

===Coroner's inquest===
[[Image:Chicago race riot, three African American men moving furniture while young Caucasian boys watch.jpg|thumb|left|Three African American men moving furniture while young Caucasian boys watch]]
The [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] Coroner's Office took 70 day sessions, 20 night sessions and 450 [[witness]]es examinations to collect [[evidence]] about the riots.<ref name=RR/> Their report stated the finding that on July 27, 1919, Eugene Williams, a African American youth, drowned after tiring of holding onto a [[railroad tie]].  He had been hit by a stone as whites threw rocks at African Americans to drive them away from their part of the water at the 29th Street beach in the city's [[Douglas, Chicago|Douglas]] community on the South Side. A witness recalled seeing a single white male standing on a [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] {{convert|75|ft|m|1}} from the raft of the African Americans and throwing rocks at them. Williams was struck in the forehead; he panicked and drowned. The assailant ran toward 29th Street, where a different fight had already started when African Americans tried to use the beach there, in defiance of its tacit segregation. 

The rioting escalated when a white [[police officer]] refused to arrest the white man who threw the stone at Williams.  He instead arrested an African American individual. Anger over this, coupled with Eugene Williams' death, and rumors among both communities, escalated into five days of rioting.  Most of the casualties were African American and most of the property damage was in African American neighborhoods. The city quickly closed down the [[street car]]s to try to contain the violence. Inflammatory newspaper coverage worked to the opposite effect.<ref name=RR>{{cite web|url=http://www.chipublib.org/cplbooksmovies/cplarchive/chidisasters/raceriots.php|accessdate=2007-05-07|year=2006|month=February|publisher=Chicago Public Library||title=1919: Race Riots|author=O'Brien, Ellen and Lyle Benedict}}</ref>  Historians have noted:

[[Image:Chicago Race Riot 1919.gif|thumb|A map of the riot-affected areas on the [[South Side of Chicago]], with the [[Union Stock Yards]] visible. North is to the right.]]
<blockquote>"South Side youth gangs, including the Hamburg Athletic Club, were later found to have been among the primary instigators of the racial violence. "For weeks, in the spring and summer of 1919, they had been anticipating, even eagerly awaiting, a race riot", one study found. "On several occasions, they themselves had endeavored to precipitate one, and now that racial violence threatened to become generalized and unrestrained throughout Chicago, they were set to exploit the chaos."<ref name=RR/></blockquote>

Early reports detailed injuries to [[Chicago Police Department|Chicago Police]] officers and a [[Chicago Fire Department|Chicago fireman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/4975/|accessdate=2007-08-27|date=1919-07-28|title="A Crowd of Howling Negroes": The Chicago Daily Tribune Reports the Chicago Race Riot, 1919|publisher=History Matters|work=Chicago Daily Tribune}}</ref> The conduct of the white police force was criticized during and after the riot. State's Attorney Maclay Hoyne openly charged the police with arresting African American rioters but refusing to arrest white rioters.<ref name=CaIER/>  Roaming gangs of Bridgeport whites, who were mostly ethnic Irish, perpetrated much of the violence.<ref name=CaIER/> While newspapers carried accounts of African Americans setting fires, "later the office of State [[Fire Marshall]] Gamber proved conclusively that the fires were not caused by Negroes, but by whites."<ref name=CaIER/>  No whites were convicted of any of the murders, and most of the deaths were not prosecuted.  One man was prosecuted for Williams' death, the result of rock throwing that had precipitated the riot, but was acquitted.<ref name=HiC1919/>

===Ramifications===
[[Image:Chicago race riot, house with broken windows and debris in front yard.jpg|thumb|left|House with broken windows and debris in front yard]]
There were broad ramifications for the [[Economy of Chicago|Chicago economy]].  The [[Union Stock Yard]], one of Chicago's largest employers, was an example.  It had been anticipated that all 15,000 workers would return to work on Monday August 4, 1919.<ref name=TROiC/><ref name=RiCKMC>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B01EEDF1738E13ABC4B53DFBE668382609EDE|title=Rioters in Chicago Knife Militia Captain|accessdate=2008-05-09|date=[[1919-08-03]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>  But after arson and mayhem erupted, African-American employees were banned from the stock yard until further notice.<ref name=RiCKMC/>   African-American employees were kept out for ten days of work after the riot.  On August 8, 1919, about 3,000 non-[[Trade union|union]] African Americans, who comprised about one-fifth of the total African-American employees, showed up for work under the protection of special police, [[deputy sheriff]]s, and [[militia]].  The white union employees threatened to strike if the use of  protective forces was not discontinued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B01E5DE1F3BEE3ABC4053DFBE668382609EDE|title=White Union Protests Stock Yard Guards|accessdate=2008-05-08|date=[[1919-08-08]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>  Many African Americans fled the city as a result of the pandemonium.<ref name=2D5HITDRRIC/>

[[Illinois Attorney General]] [[Edward Brundage]] and State's Attorney Hoyne gathered evidence to prepare for a [[Grand Jury]] investigation.  The intention was to pursue people  of both races and to use the [[death penalty]] as necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D07E3DF1F3BEE3ABC4953DFBE668382609EDE|title=Soldiers Rescue Negroes in Clash With Chicago Mob|accessdate=2008-05-09|date=[[1919-08-01]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>  On August 4, 1919 seventeen indictments against African Americans were handed down.  Despite extensive rioting by whites and damage to black areas, no whites were indicted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9F0CE1DD1738E13ABC4D53DFBE668382609EDE|title=Indict 17 Negro Rioters|accessdate=2008-05-09|date=[[1919-08-05]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> 

Richard J. Daley was soon elected leader of the Hamburg Athletic Club in Bridgeport. In his long political career, he never confirmed or denied whether he was involved in the violence of the riots.  Daley served as the city's mayor and most powerful politician in the [[Chicago Democratic Machine]] from 1955 to 1976.<ref name = ChiHI>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagohistory.info/stories/daley/racism.html|title=Richard J.

In 1930, the flamboyant Republican mayor [[William Hale Thompson]] invoked the riot in a misleading pamphlet when urging African Americans against voting for the Republican nominee [[United States House of Representatives|Rep]] [[Ruth Hanna McCormick]] in the United States Senate race for her late husband's seat.  She was the widow of [[United States Senate|Sen]]. [[Joseph Medill McCormick]] as well as the sister-in-law of ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' publisher [[Robert Rutherford McCormick]].  The McCormicks were a powerful Chicago family whom Thompson opposed.<ref name=TvM>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,882358,00.html|title=Thompson v. McCormicks|accessdate=2008-05-02|date=[[1930-11-03]]|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|work=[[Time]]}}</ref>

[[United States President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] pronounced the white participants as the instigators of the prolonged riots in Chicago and [[Washington, D.C.]].  As a result, he attempted to promote greater racial harmony through the promotion of voluntary organizations and through the enactment of legislative improvements by the [[United States Congress]]. He did not change the segregation of Federal departments which he had imposed early during his first administration,  however.  The riot shocked the nation and raised awareness of racial problems.  It also demonstrated the new willingness of African Americans to fight for their [[civil rights]] despite injustice and oppression.<ref name=CRRo19/>
