'''Victorian wine''' is [[wine]] made in the [[Australia]]n state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. With over 600 wineries, Victoria has more wine producers than any other [[Australian wine]]-producing state but ranks third in overall wine production due to the lack of a mass bulk wine-producing area like [[South Australian wine|South Australia's]] [[Riverland]] and [[New South Wales]]'s [[Riverina]]. [[Viticulture]] has existed in Victoria since the 19th century and experienced a high point in the 1890s when the region produced more than half of all wine produced in Australia. The [[phylloxera]] epidemic that soon followed took a hard toll on the Victoria wine industry which did not fully recover till the 1950s. Today [[winemaking]] is spread out across the state and features premier [[List of wine producing regions|wine regions]] such as [[Heathcote wine region|Heatcote]], [[Rutherglen, Victoria|Rutherglen]] and the [[Yarra Valley]]. Single [[varietal]] wines produced in the region include the Australian mainstays of [[Shiraz (grape)|Shiraz]] and [[Chardonnay]] as well as the more obscure [[Viognier]], [[Pinot noir]], [[Graciano]] and [[Tannat]]. The style of wine ranges from full body red wine to [[Madeira wine|Madeira]]-like [[fortified wine]]s such as [[Liqueur Muscat]].<ref name="Oxford pg 733-734"> J.

[[Image:Victorian Sauvignon blanc from Australia.JPG|left|thumb|200px|A Victorian Sauvignon blanc.]]
Some of the earliest commercial plantings in Victoria was near [[Yering, Victoria|Yering]] and established by [[Hubert de Castella]], a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[immigrant]] who came to the region in 1854. The [[Great French Wine Blight|devastation of France's vineyards]] by the phylloxera [[louse]] opened up an opportunity for the [[United Kingdom|British]] wine market which traditionally heavily favored [[French wine]]. Castella was very ambitious and laid out his plans for Victoria to produce enough wine to supply all of England's needs in his treatises ''[[John Bull]]'s vineyard''. Unfortunately before Castella's grand plan could be fully realized, phylloxera made its own way to Australia and the viticultural set back was compounded with the development of a domestic [[temperance movement]] as well as economic uncertainty and labor shortages during the [[World War I|first World War]].<ref name="Oxford pg 733-734"/>

Early in Victoria's wine history, most of the wine industry was settled in the cool souther coastal regions around [[Melbourne]]. At the turn of the 20th century, focus began to move to the warmer northeastern zone around Rutherglen. The region began to establish a reputation for its sweet, fortified wines made from [[late harvest wine|late harvest]] grapes that are shriveled to near [[raisin]]s and then spend several months (or years) aging in [[oak (wine)|oak]] barrels stored inside a hot tin shed that acts like an oven. The unique nature of these Liqueur Muscat and Liqueur Tokay helped sustain this part of the Victoria wine industry till the country wide wine renaissance of the 1950-1960s.<ref name="Oxford pg 733-734"/>

==Wine regions==
[[Image:Victoria wine zones.JPG|right|250px|thumb|Victoria's wine zones.]]
Since the 1960s, Australia's labeling laws have centered around an [[appellation]] system that distinguishes the geographic origins of the grape. Under these laws at least 85% of the grapes must be from the region that is designated on the [[wine label]]. In the late 1990s more definitive boundaries were established that divided Australia up into ''Geographic Indications'' (GI) known as '''zones''', '''regions''' and '''subregions'''.<ref name="Oxford pg 47-48"> J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition pg 47-48 Oxford University Press 2006 ISBN 0198609906 </ref> The wine zones of Victoria are '''Central Victoria''', '''North East Victoria''', '''North West Victoria''', '''Western Victoria''', '''[[Port Phillip]]''' and '''[[Gippsland]]'''.<ref name="Oxford pg 733-734"/>

Gippsland is one of the newest and least developed wine regions in Victoria. Serious planting did not begin till the late 1970s. Located to the east of the Mornington Pensinsula, the region is current dominated with Pinot noir and Chardonnay plantings.<ref name="Robinson pg 318-319"/> [[Sparkling wine]] has shown some potential here with the Chardonnay and Pinot noir grapes showing a bit of spiciness that adds complexity to the wine.<ref name="Fallis pg 423-429"/>

===Central Victoria===
*'''Heathcote''' is known for its [[temperate climate]] and 500 million year old [[Cambrian]] soil that seems particularly well suited for producing deeply colored, rich Shiraz wines with [[alcohol level]]s around 14-15%.<ref name="Oxford pg 733-734"/>

*'''[[Bendigo]]''' was historically a part of the Heathcote region but has since distinguished itself with its [[Cabernet Sauvignon]].<ref name="Oxford pg 733-734"/>

*'''[[Goulburn Valley]]''', with its sub region '''[[Nagambie Lake]]''', is the oldest continuously producing Victorian wine region and has producing Shiraz, most notably at [[Tahbilk]], since 1860. [[Marsanne]], Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay are also widely planted.<ref name="Oxford pg 733-734"/>

*'''[[Shire of Strathbogie|Strathbogie Ranges]]''' is one of Central Victoria's cooler wine region and more closely resembles the North East Victoria regions of Alpine Valley and Beechworth. The region is known primarily for its Chardonnay, [[Riesling]], [[Gew<U+00FC>rztraminer]], [[Pinot gris]] and Viognier.<ref name="Oxford pg 733-734"/>

===North East Victoria===
*'''[[Alpine Valleys]]''' & '''[[Beechworth]]''' are known mostly for their [[table wine]] production in an area that is distinctively cooler than other North East Victorian wine regions.<ref name="Oxford pg 733-734"/> Some wineries have begun experimented with [[Piedmont wine]] grapes, such as [[Nebbiolo]], [[Dolcetto]] and [[Barbera]] to some degree of success in this [[subalpine]] climate.<ref name="Robinson pg 318-319"/>

*'''[[Glenrowan]]''' & '''Rutherglen''' are known for their full-[[body (wine)|bodied]] red wines made from Shiraz and [[Durif]] as well as their [[sweetness of wine|sweet]] fortified wines. The [[continental climate]] of the area is marked by very warm summers and moderate evenings.<ref name="Oxford pg 733-734"/> Rainfall is very low and spring [[frost]] pose a viticultural hazard. Closer to [[Mount Buffalo National Park|Mount Buffalo]], the vineyards located in nearby [[Ovens Valley]] receive more rainfall and cooler temperatures. The first record of plantings in this area date to 1851 and by the 1870s, this was Australia's largest wine producing area.<ref name="Fallis pg 423-429"/>

*'''[[King Valley]]''' is known for its wide range of planted [[List of grape varieties|grape varieties]] including Graciano, [[Marzemino]], [[Mondeuse]], [[Petit Manseng]], [[Sagrantino]], [[Saperavi]] and Tannat.<ref name="Oxford pg 733-734"/> The region is located on more mountainous terrain and receives varying degrees of rainfall depending on the location. The [[Brown Brothers Milawa Vineyard]] was establish here in 1889.<ref name="Fallis pg 423-429"/>

===North West Victoria===
The North West Victoria zone is the most similar Victorian wine region to South Australia's Riverland in that generous [[irrigation]] sources provides for high yielding production. [[Lindemans (wine)|Lindemans]] Bin 65 Chardonnay was first produced in this region, and it produces some of the grapes for [[Yellow Tail (wine)|Yellow Tail]].<ref name="Oxford pg 733-734"/>

*'''[[Murray Darling]]'''

*'''[[Swan Hill]]'''

===Western Victoria===
The geography of Western Australia covers flat [[pasture]]s and [[granite]] [[escarpment]]. With low annual rainfall, the area relies heavily on irrigation. Springtime frost is a significant viticulture hazard as is ripening during the cool summers. Winters are normally cold and wet. The far southwest of the west has more of a [[maritime climate]].<ref name="Fallis pg 423-429"> C. Fallis, editor ''The Encyclopedic Atlas of Wine'' pg 423-429 Global Book Publishing 2006 ISBN 1740480503 </ref>

*'''[[Grampians wine region|Grampians]]''', with its sub region '''[[Great Western, Victoria|Great Western]]''', is generally a cooler climate red wine producing region known for jucy berry fruit Shiraz and Cabernets with distinctive [[eucalyptus]] and [[spice]].<ref name="Oxford pg 733-734"/> The area has experienced some success with Riesling and sweet sparkling wine.<ref name="Robinson pg 318-319"/>

*'''[[Henty, Victoria|Henty]]''' has a cooler climate than the Grampians and produces more white wines and a little Pinot noir. The main varieties are Chardonnay, Riesling, [[Semillon]], and [[Sauvignon blanc]].<ref name="Oxford pg 733-734"/>

*'''[[Pyrenees (Victoria)|Pyrenees]]''' is known for its Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon that are similar to the wines produces in Heathcote and Bendigo.<ref name="Oxford pg 733-734"/> Sauvignon blanc from this region has a distinctive [[flint]]y dryness that is found underneath layers of [[tropical fruit]]s. [[Sangiovese]], Viognier and Pinot gris have started to expand plantings.<ref name="Fallis pg 423-429"/>

===Port Phillip===
The Port Phillip zone includes the five regions clustered around the Melbourne. The climate of this more closely resembles [[Bordeaux]] than in other Australia wine regions yet it is more thoroughly planted with [[Burgundy wine]] varieties like a Pinot noir and Chardonnay. Other areas are planted with Shiraz.<ref name="Oxford pg 733-734"/>
[[Image:Australia Chandon sparkling wines and still pinot noir.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Sparkling wines and a still Pinot noir wine from Domaine Chandon's Yarra Valley winery.]]
*'''Yarra Valley''' is a cooler climate region and is known primarily for its Chardonnay and Pinot noir.<ref name="Oxford pg 733-734"/> The area has been cultivating a reputation for quality wine for over a century. In recent times, the sparkling wine industry has started to take notice with [[Mo<U+00EB>t et Chandon]] opening up [[Domaine Chandon Australia]] and producing wine under the Green Point label.<ref name="Robinson pg 318-319"> J. Robinson ''Jancis Robinson's Wine Course'' Third Edition pg 318-319 Abbeville Press 2003 ISBN 0789208830 </ref> The first vineyards were believes to have been planted here in the late 1830s and by the end of the 19th century, wines from the Yarra Valley were winning gold medals at European [[wine competition]]s. In the 1970s, the region experienced it owns renaissance and has leveraged its close location to Melbourne into become a tourist destination for wine. The warmer climate of the Valley have shown itself suitable for Shiraz and Cabernet and have shown promise for [[Roussanne]], Marsanne , Sauvignon blanc and Pinot gris.<ref name="Fallis pg 423-429"/>

*'''[[Shire of Macedon Ranges|Macedon Ranges]]''' is known for its Cabernet Sauvignon and [[Merlot]] wines.<ref name="Oxford pg 733-734"/> The area sits on predominately granite based soils that has shown some promise for the sparkling wine varieties of Pinot noir and Chardonnay. Some Shiraz wines from this region have developed [[cult wine|cult status]] due to their reputation for powerful fruit, spice and soft tannins.<ref name="Fallis pg 423-429"/>

*'''[[Sunbury, Victoria|Sunbury]]''' is located north of Melbourne and has been producing Shiraz since 1872. Is known particularly now for its Shiraz-Viognier blends that are more ''[[terroir]]'' driven than [[New World wine|New World]].<ref name="Oxford pg 733-734"/>

*'''[[Geelong]]''' is heavily influenced by nearby [[Port Philip Bay]] and has been achieving international recognition for the quality of its Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Riesling and Viognier.<ref name="Robinson pg 318-319"/> As one of mainland Australia's most southernly wine region, vineyards in the Geelong enjoy a long growing season influenced by maritime conditions. This helps the grape develop a complexity of flavors and depth in character for the resulting wines.<ref name="Fallis pg 423-429"/>

*'''[[Mornington Peninsula]]''' is located south across Port Philip Bay from Geelong and shares a similar reputation for Pinot noir and Chardonnay but has been developing its plantings of Pinot gris.<ref name="Robinson pg 318-319"/> The area has a marginal climate that is influenced by maritime conditions across the hilly terrain. There are five "unofficial" sub districts on the Peninsula-[[Dromana, Victoria|Dromana]], [[Main Ridge, Victoria|Main Ridge]], [[Merricks, Victoria|Merricks]], [[Moorooduc, Victoria|Moorooduc]] and [[Red Hill, Victoria|Red Hill]]. The region is known for its medium bodied, dry wines and sparkling wines that show structure and complexity. The still wine versions of Chardonnay reflect a diversity of styles, all typically unoaked, from more [[citrus]] to more tropical fruit flavors.<ref name="Fallis pg 423-429"/>
