'''Nicholas Gregory "Greg" Mankiw''' ({{pronEng|m<U+00E6><U+014B><U+02C8>kju<U+02D0>}}) (born [[February 3]], [[1958]]) is an American [[macroeconomics|macroeconomist]]. From 2003 to 2005, Mankiw was the chairman of [[George W. Bush|President Bush's]] [[Council of Economic Advisors]]. He is among the most influential economists in the world according to [[RePEc| IDEAS/RePEc]].<ref>[http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html Economist Rankings at IDEAS]</ref>

==Education==
Mankiw was born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]]. In his youth, he attended the [[Pingry School]], and then graduated from [[Princeton University]] ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1980 with an [[Bachelor of Arts|AB]] in Economics.<ref>Andres, Edmund L. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502EFDD133CF93BA15751C0A9659C8B63 "A Salesman for Bush's Tax Plan Who Has Belittled Similar Ideas"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[February 28]], [[2003]].</ref> He spent a year working on his [[PhD]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and a subsequent year studying at [[Harvard Law School]]. He worked as a staff economist for the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] from 1982-83, foreshadowing his later position as chairman of that organization. After leaving the Council, he earned his [[Ph.D.]] in Economics from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1984. He returned to Harvard Law for a year but, having completed his PhD and realizing he was only an average law student, he left to teach at MIT for a year and then became an assistant professor of Economics at [[Harvard University]] in 1985 and full professor in 1987. He returned to politics when he was appointed by President [[George W. Bush]] as Chairman of the [[Council of Economic Advisors]] in May 2003. He has since resumed teaching at Harvard, taking over the introductory economics course Social Analysis 10 (affectionately referred to as "Ec. 10").  This is the same course that had been taught for many years by [[Martin Feldstein]].  Mankiw is currently a visiting fellow at the [[American Enterprise Institute]].

==Academic career==

{{merge|Pigou Club|Talk:THIS PAGE# N. Gergory Mankiw|date=December 2007}}

He has written two popular college-level textbooks: one in intermediate macroeconomics and the more famous ''Principles of Economics,'' which is popular among high-school [[Advanced Placement Economics]] teachers. More than one million copies of the books have been sold in seventeen languages. 

Mankiw is a [[New Keynesian economics|New Keynesian]] economist.  He did important work on [[menu costs]], which are a source of [[price stickiness]].  In 1989, he wrote a paper arguing that the aging of the [[baby boomers]] was going to undermine the housing market in the 1990s and 2000s.<ref>{{ cite journal | last = Mankiw | first = N. Gregory | authorlink = | coauthors = Weil, David N. | year = 1990 | month = | title = The Baby Boom, The Baby Bust, and the Housing Market | journal = NBER Working Paper | volume = W2794 | issue = | pages = | id = | url = http://ssrn.com/abstract=245837 | accessdate = | quote = }}</ref>  His advocacy at the CEA of [[tax cut]]s even in the face of large [[deficit]]s led some other economists, such as [[Paul Krugman]] and [[J. Bradford DeLong]], to criticize him as in thrall to Bush administration policies.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Mankiw has become an influential figure in the [[Blogosphere]] and online journalism since launching his [[blog]]. The blog, while ostensibly prepared to assist his Ec10 students, has managed to gain a readership that extends far beyond students of introductory economics.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_SNVRJPJ Economists&apos; blogs | The invisible hand on the keyboard | Economist.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In particular, he has advocated a [[pigovian tax]], such as a tax on gasoline or a more broad-based [[carbon tax]].<ref>[http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/10/pigou-club-manifesto.html Greg Mankiw's Blog: The Pigou Club Manifesto<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In November 2006, Mankiw became an official economic advisor to then-[[Massachusetts]] [[Governor of Massachusetts|governor]] [[Mitt Romney]]'s [[political action committee]], Commonwealth PAC.<ref>http://www.thecommonwealthpac.com/news/pr_061129.html</ref> In 2007, he signed on as an economic advisor to [[Mitt Romney]]'s [[presidential campaign]].<ref>http://electioncentral.tpmcafe.com/blog/electioncentral/2006/dec/21/your_massive_election_central_guide_to_2008_presidential_campaign_staffs</ref>

==Controversy==
===Benefits of outsourcing===
Several controversies arose from CEA's February 2004 Economic Report of the President.<ref>[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy05/pdf/2004_erp.pdf Economic Report of the President - 2004<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In a press conference, Mankiw spoke of the gains from free trade, noting that [[outsourcing]] of jobs by U.S. companies is "probably a plus for the economy in the long run."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/02/12/bush.outsourcing CNN.com - Bush adviser backs off pro-outsourcing comment - Feb. 12, 2004<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://post.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/mankiw/papers/Outsourcing%20-%20Mankiw-Swagel%20for%20C-R%20conference%20Nov%2010%202005.pdf Harvard Econ Department - Contact Info for N. Gregory Mankiw<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> While this reflected mainstream economic analysis, it was criticized by many people who drew a link between outsourcing and the still-slow recovery of the U.S. labor market in early 2004. The White House economic forecast contained in the report was criticized for being overly optimistic about job gains--and indeed, job growth turned out to be slower than the Administration forecast. 

===Service versus manufacturing===
Controversy also arose from a rhetorical question posed by the report (and repeated by Mankiw in a speech about the report):<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/economic_report-20040217.html Remarks on the 2004 Economic Report of the President to the National Economists Club and Society of Government Economists<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> "when a fast-food restaurant sells a hamburger, is it providing a service or combining inputs to manufacture a product?"  The intended point was that the distinction between manufacturing and service industry is somewhat arbitrary and therefore a poor basis for policy. Even though the issue was not raised in the report, a news account led to criticism that the Administration was seeking to cover up job losses in manufacturing by redefining jobs such as flipping hamburgers as manufacturing.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02EFDC113DF933A15751C0A9629C8B63 "In the New Economics: Fast-Food Factories?"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[February 20]], [[2004]], accessed [[March 28]], [[2008]].</ref>
