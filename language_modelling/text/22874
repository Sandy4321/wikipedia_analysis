Its territory covers 8,514,876.599 km<sup>2</sup> between central [[South America]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and it is the easternmost country of the [[Americas]]. It borders [[Venezuela]], [[Suriname]], [[Guyana]] and the ''[[Departments of France|d<U+00E9>partement]]'' of [[French Guiana]] to the north, [[Uruguay]] to the south, [[Argentina]] and [[Paraguay]] to the southwest, [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]] to the west, and [[Colombia]] to the northwest. The only South American countries not bordered by Brazil are [[Ecuador]] and [[Chile]]. The Brazilian coastline covers 7,367 km to the east. Numerous [[archipelago]]s are part of the Brazilian territory, such as [[Penedos de S<U+00E3>o Pedro e S<U+00E3>o Paulo]], [[Fernando de Noronha]], [[Trindade e Martim Vaz]] and [[Atol das Rocas]]. 

[[Tropical climate]] is predominant. In the south of the country, [[subtropical climate]] prevails. Brazil is traversed by the [[Equator]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn]] lines. It is home to varied fauna and flora and extensive natural resources.
 
Brazil was colonized by [[Portugal]] in 1500 and has been a [[sovereign nation]] since 1822. The republican system has been adopted since 1889. Its current [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution]] defines Brazil as a [[Federal Republic]]. The Federation is formed by the indissoluble association of the [[States]], the [[Federal District]], and the [[Municipalities]]. There are currently 26 States and 5,564 Municipalities.

The Brazilian population tends to concentrate along the coastline in large urban centers. While Brazil has one of the largest populations in the world, [[population density]] is low and the inner continental land has large demographical empty spaces. It is a [[multiracial]] country composed of [[European]], [[Amerindian]], [[African]] and [[Asian]] elements, more often mixed in the same individual than separated into different communities. The official language is [[Portuguese]], and it is the only [[Portuguese language|Portuguese-speaking]] country in all the Americas. [[Catholicism]] is the predominant religion, though [[Protestant]] communities have experienced significant growth in the last decades. Brazil has the largest Roman Catholic population in the world.

==History==
[[Image:Brazil-16-map.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Brazil issued by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[explorer]]s in [[1519]].]]
{{main|History of Brazil}}
Before the first [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers, led by [[Pedro <U+00C1>lvares Cabral]], arrived in 1500, Brazil is thought to have been inhabited by semi-[[nomad]]ic populations for at least 10,000 years. Over the next three centuries, it was resettled by the Portuguese and exploited mainly for [[brazil wood]] (Pau-Brasil), then [[sugarcane]] (Cana-de-A<U+00E7><U+00FA>car), coffee beans and [[gold mining]]. The colony's manpower was initially composed of [[Slavery#Slavery in Brazil|enslaved]] peoples, firstly [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindians]] and then, after 1532, mainly [[African]]s.

The only recorded transcontinental relocation of a royal family occurred in 1808 when the Portuguese royal family, headed by Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]] and her son and regent, the future [[John VI of Portugal|Jo<U+00E3>o VI of Portugal]], fled [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s armies and relocated to [[Rio de Janeiro]], along with the government and nobility. Although they returned in 1821, the interlude led to the opening of commercial ports to the [[United Kingdom]] &mdash; at the time isolated from most European ports by Napoleon &mdash; and to the elevation of Brazil to the status of a United Kingdom under the Portuguese Crown. Upon [[John VI of Portugal|Jo<U+00E3>o VI's]] departure, the remaining royal government in [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]] moved to dissolve the Kingdom of Brazil and return it to the status of colony. This resulted in the small scale conflicts known as the [[Brazilian War of Independence]]. On [[7 September]] [[1822]] Prince regent [[Dom Pedro I]] (later Pedro IV of Portugal) declared independence, establishing the independent [[Empire of Brazil]]. A treaty recognizing the Empire's independence was signed on [[29 August]], [[1825]] with Britain and Portugal. As the crown remained in the hands of the [[House of Braganza|House of Bragan<U+00E7>a]], this was more the severance of the Portuguese empire in two, than an independence movement as seen elsewhere in the Americas.	 
		 
[[Image:Fala do trono.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Dom [[Pedro II of Brazil]], 1873.]]
The [[Brazilian]] Empire was formally a democracy in the [[Westminster system|British style]], although in practice, the emperor-premier-parliament balance of power more closely resembled the autocratic [[Austrian Empire]]. The [[Male Revolt]], the most important urban slave rebellion in the Americas, took place in Bahia, 1835.<ref>[http://www.press-dev.jhu.edu/books/title_pages/2365.html]</ref> Slavery was abolished in 1888, through the "Golden Law", created by [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil|Princess Isabel]], and intensive European immigration created the basis for industrialization. Pedro I was succeeded by his son, [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] &mdash; who in old age was caught by a political dispute between the Army and the Cabinet, a crisis arising from the [[War of the Triple Alliance|Paraguay War]]. Pedro II was deposed from the throne on [[15 November]] [[1889]], when a [[federal republic]] (officially, the Republic of the United States of Brazil) was established by [[Marechal Deodoro da Fonseca|Field Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca]]. 

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Brazil attracted over 5 million [[Europe]]an, [[Arab]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[immigrant]]s. During this time Brazil became industrialized, further colonized, and its interior further explored and developed. Brazilian democracy was replaced by [[dictatorship]]s three times &mdash; 1930&ndash;1934 and 1937&ndash;1945 under [[Get<U+00FA>lio Vargas]], and 1964&ndash;1985, under a succession of generals appointed by the military. It is important to note that the military forces responsible for the coup of 1964 had the "cooperation" of the U.S. Government. Lincoln Gordon (American Ambassador to Brazil) reported that the "pro-United States" rebellion would help to "restrain left-wing excesses" and "create a greatly improved climate for private investment."<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Hegemony-Survival-Americas-Dominance-American/dp/0805074007]</ref>

Since 1985, Brazil has been regarded as a [[presidential democracy]], a status affirmed by a [[plebiscite]] in 1993 which asked voters to indicate a preference for a presidential or [[parliamentary system]]. Voters also decided not to restore the country's [[constitutional monarchy]].

== Government and politics ==
[[Image:Congresso_brasilia.jpg|left|thumb|The National Congress in [[Bras<U+00ED>lia]], the [[capital]] of Brazil.]]
[[Image:Senado2006.jpg|left|thumb|The Senate, located in the [[Congresso Nacional|National Congress]].]]
{{main|Politics of Brazil}}<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->
The capital of Brazil is [[Bras<U+00ED>lia]]. According to the Constitution promulgated in 1988, Brazil is a [[Federation|federal]] [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], wherein the [[President of Brazil|President]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. Currently the President of Brazil is Luiz In<U+00E1>cio Lula da Silva (Lula). He was re-elected on [[October 29]], [[2006]], extending his position as President of Brazil until [[January 1]], 2011. One of the fundamental principles of the politics in the Republic is the multi-party system, as a guarantee of political freedom.
[[Image:Lula - foto oficial05012007.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Brazil's current [[President of Brazil|president]], [[Luiz In<U+00E1>cio Lula da Silva]].]]
The administrative structure of the State is a federation; however, Brazil has included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation tripartite: encompassing the Union, the States, and the municipalities. The legal system is based on [[Roman law]].

The Union's [[executive power]] is exercised by the government, headed by the president, who is elected for a four-year term, and is allowed to be re-elected for one other term. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]], which is bicameral. The [[deputies]] of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]] are elected every four years in a system of proportional representation by states. 

The members of the [[Federal Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]] are elected for an eight-year term. The Ordinary Law making process requires the participation of the executive, which has a right to veto on new legislation, and has an exclusive prerogative of initiative of legislation on certain matters. Additionally, if relevant and urgent circumstances justify it, the executive may issue a "Provisory Measure," which has the binding force of the Law and comes into force immediately. The "Provisory Measure" retains its full power for up to 120 days, unless it is removed by the Congress.

== Law ==

{{main|Law of Brazil}}

[[Image:STF.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the [[Supreme Federal Tribunal]] during trial.]]
Brazilian Law is based on Roman-Germanic traditions. Thus, [[civil law]] concepts prevail. Most areas are [[codified]], although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part of the system, playing a complementary role. Court decisions set interpretation guidelines, but are not binding towards other cases, save for very few exceptional situations. Doctrinal works and comments of legal scholars have strong influence in law creation and in legal cases.

The Federal Constitution, promulgated on the 5th of October of 1988, is the fundamental law of Brazil and governs the system. All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules. As of April 2007, it has seen 53 Amendments. States also adopt their own Constitutions, but like all other legislation, they must not contradict the Federal Constitution. Municipalities and the Federal District do not have their own Constitutions. Instead, they adopt "organic laws" ({{lang|pt|''leis org<U+00E2>nicas''}}).

Legislative entities are the main source of statutes, although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may also enact legal norms. The Union enacts federal laws through the houses of the National Congress. The States, Municipalities and Federal District enact, respectively, state, municipal and district laws through local legislative houses. There is no hierarchy among federal, state, municipal and district laws. To avoid possible contradictions, the Federal Constitution determines which areas each entity may legislate upon. Therefore, a certain law may be deemed unconstitutional if it invades a subject reserved to laws of another legislative house.

[[Jurisdiction]] is administered by the judiciary entities, although in rare cases, article 52 of the Federal Constitution permits the Federal Senate to pass legal judgments. The judiciary is organized on the Federal and State levels, though not in Municipalities. There are also specialized military, labor, and elections courts. The highest court is the [[Supreme Federal Tribunal]]. 

The main criticism met by the system over the last decades relates to the slow pace at which final decisions are passed. Lawsuits on appeal may take several years and in some cases more than a decade to see definitive judgment.

== States ==
{{Brazil Labelled Map|float=right}}
{{main|States of Brazil}}
Brazil is a [[federation]] consisting of twenty-six states ({{lang|pt|''estados''}}) and one federal district ({{lang|pt|''Distrito Federal''}}), making a total of twenty-seven "federate units"<!--"federal units"...?-->.

The Brazilian states enjoy a significant autonomy of government, law making, public security and taxation. The government of a state is headed by a [[Governor]] ({{lang|pt|''governador''}}), elected by popular vote, and also comprises its own legislative body ({{lang|pt|''assembl<U+00E9>ia legislativa''}}).
Each state is divided into [[municipality|municipalities]] ({{lang|pt|''munic<U+00ED>pios''}}) with their own [[legislative]] council ({{lang|pt|''c<U+00E2>mara de vereadores''}}) and a mayor ({{lang|pt|''prefeito''}}), which are autonomous and hierarchically independent from both federal and state government. A municipality may include other towns ({{lang|pt|''distritos''}}) besides the municipal seat; those, however, have no separate government.

The [[judiciary]] is organised at the state and federal levels within districts called {{lang|pt|''foros''}}. The {{lang|pt|''foros''}} in the state judiciary are called {{lang|pt|''comarcas''}}. Each {{lang|pt|''comarca''}} may include one or several municipalities. In the federal judiciary the {{lang|pt|''foros''}} are called {{lang|pt|''se<U+00E7><U+00F5>es judici<U+00E1>rias''}}. One {{lang|pt|''se<U+00E7><U+00E3>o judici<U+00E1>ria''}} corresponds to the area of one State or the Federal District, according to article 110 of the Federal Constitution. {{lang|pt|''Se<U+00E7><U+00F5>es judici<U+00E1>rias''}} may be divided in smaller units, called {{lang|pt|''subse<U+00E7><U+00F5>es judici<U+00E1>rias''}}.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Br-map.png|thumb|right|General map of Brazil]]
{{main|Geography of Brazil}}
Brazil is characterized by the extensive low-lying [[Amazon Rainforest]] in the north and a more open terrain of hills and low mountains to the south &mdash; home to most of the Brazilian population and its agricultural base. Along the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast are also found several mountain ranges, reaching roughly 2,900 [[metre]]s (9,500&nbsp;[[Foot (unit of length)|ft]]) high.

The highest peak is the 3,014 metre (9,735&nbsp;ft) [[Pico da Neblina]] (''Misty Peak'') in [[Guiana]]'s [[highlands]]. Major rivers include the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], the largest river in the world in flowing water volume, and the second-longest in the world; the [[Paran<U+00E1> River|Paran<U+00E1>]] and its major tributary, the [[Igua<U+00E7>u]] River, where the [[Igua<U+00E7>u Falls]] are located; the [[Rio Negro|Negro]], [[S<U+00E3>o Francisco River|S<U+00E3>o Francisco]], [[Xingu River|Xingu]], [[Madeira river|Madeira]] and the [[Tapaj<U+00F3>s]] rivers.

Located mainly within the [[tropics]], Brazil's [[climate]] has little seasonal variation. In southernmost Brazil, however, there is subtropical temperate weather, occasionally experiencing frost and snow in the higher regions. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is abundant in the humid [[Amazon Basin]], but more arid landscapes are found as well, particularly in the northeast.

A number of [[island]]s in the Atlantic Ocean are part of Brazil:
*[[S<U+00E3>o Pedro e S<U+00E3>o Paulo|Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago]]
*[[Rocas Atoll]]
*[[Fernando de Noronha]]
*[[Trindade and Martim Vaz]]

[[Image:Brasil.RioDeJaneiro.LeblonUndIpanema.jpg|thumb|right|The beaches of [[Rio de Janeiro]], the second largest city of Brazil, are famous worldwide.]]
Geographically, mainland Brazil is commonly divided into five [[region]]s: [[North Region, Brazil|North]], [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]], [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West]], [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] and [[Southern Region, Brazil|South]].

* The North constitutes 45.27% of the surface of Brazil and it is the region with the lowest number of inhabitants. With the exception of [[Manaus]], which hosts a tax-free industrial zone, and [[Bel<U+00E9>m]], with the biggest metropolitan area of the region, it is a fairly unindustrialised and undeveloped region. It accommodates most of the largest rainforest of the world and many [[indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous tribes]].

* The Northeast has one third of Brazil's population. The region is culturally diverse, with roots from the Portuguese colonial period, [[Afro-Brazilian]] culture and some Brazilian Indian influence. It is also the poorest region of Brazil, and has long periods of dry climate. It is well-known for its beautiful coast.  The most important cities are [[Recife]], [[Salvador]] and [[Fortaleza]].

* The Central-West has a low demographic density compared to the other regions, mostly because of the [[Pantanal]], the world<U+2019>s largest marshlands area, and a small part of the Amazon [[rainforest]], in the  northwest. However, much of the region is covered by [[Cerrado]], the largest [[savanna]] in the world. It is also the most important area for agriculture in the country. The most important cities of this region are: [[Bras<U+00ED>lia]] (the capital), [[Goi<U+00E2>nia]], [[Campo Grande]] and [[Cuiab<U+00E1>]].

* The Southeast is the richest and most densely populated region. It has more inhabitants than any other South American country, and hosts one of the largest [[megalopolis (term)|megalopolis]] of the world, whereof the main cities are the country's two biggest ones; [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The region is very diverse, including the major business centre of S<U+00E3>o Paulo, the historical cities of Minas Gerais and its capital [[Belo Horizonte]], the third-largest metropolitan area in Brazil, the world famous beaches of Rio de Janeiro, and the acclaimed coast of Esp<U+00ED>rito Santo.

* The South is the wealthiest region by GDP per capita and has the best [[standard of living]] in the country. It is also the coldest region of Brazil, with occasional occurrences of [[frost]]s and [[snow]] in some of the higher altitude regions. The region has been heavily settled by European immigrants, mainly of Italian, German, Portuguese and [[Slavic people|Slavic]] ancestry, and shows clear influences from these cultures. The most important cities of this region are: [[Porto Alegre]], [[Curitiba]], [[Florian<U+00F3>polis]], [[Blumenau]], [[Novo Hamburgo]], [[Londrina]], [[Caxias do Sul]], [[Pelotas]], [[Passo Fundo]] and [[Joinville]].

Possessing large and well-developed [[Agriculture|agricultural]], [[mining]], [[manufacturing]],<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/br.html CIA Factbook]</ref> and [[service sector]]s, as well as a large labor pool, Brazil's GDP (PPP) outweighs that of any other [[Latin America]]n country, being the core economy of [[Mercosul]]. The country has been expanding its presence in world markets. Major export products include [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]], [[coffee]], [[vehicles]], [[soybean]], [[iron ore]], [[orange juice]], [[steel]], [[textiles]], [[footwear]], [[corned beef]] and [[electrical equipment]]. 

[[Image:Blumenauu.jpg|250px|thumb|City of [[Blumenau]], in [[Santa Catarina]], showing the strong [[German-Brazilian|German]] influence in [[Southern Brazil]].]]
According to the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]], Brazil has the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|ninth largest]] economy in the world at [[Purchasing Power Parity]] and [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|tenth largest]] at market exchange rates. Brazil has a diversified middle income economy with wide variations in development levels. Most large industry is agglomerated in the South and South-East. The North-East is the poorest region of Brazil, but it is beginning to attract new investment.

Brazil's diverse industries range from automobiles, steel and petrochemicals to computers, aircraft, and consumer goods and amount to one-third of the [[GDP]]. With the increased economic stability provided by the [[Plano Real]], Brazilian and multinational businesses have invested heavily in new equipment and technology, a large proportion of which has been purchased from North American enterprises.

[[Image:Belo Horizonte Panor<U+00E2>mica.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Belo Horizonte]], capital of the State of [[Minas Gerais]], is one of the financial centers of Brazil.]]
Brazil has a diverse and sophisticated services industry as well. During the early 1990s, the banking sector amounted to as much as 16% of GDP. Although undergoing a major overhaul, Brazilian financial services industry provides local businesses with a wide range of products and is attracting numerous new entrants, including U.S. financial firms. The S<U+00E3>o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro stock exchanges are undergoing a consolidation.

According to international standards, Brazil has the ninth biggest economy in the world (see [[List of countries by GDP]]) and is among those countries constructing sophisticated technologies such as aircraft (see [[Embraer]]). As a core G20 country, Brazil has been expanding its influence in global economic negotiations. Although Brazil's economy is progressive and regionally important, the problems of widespread state [[bureaucracy]], [[corruption]], [[poverty]] and [[illiteracy]] are still major barriers to furthering its development.

{{main|Environment of Brazil}}
Brazil's immense area is subdivided into different [[ecosystem]]s, which together sustain some of the world's greatest [[biodiversity]]. Due to the relatively explosive economic and demographic rise of the country in the last century, Brazil's ability to protect its [[Habitat (ecology)|environmental habitat]]s has increasingly come under threat. Extensive [[logging]] in the nation's forests, particularly the Amazon, both official and unofficial, destroys areas the size of a small country each year, and potentially a diverse variety of interesting plants and animals.<ref>http://www.fs.fed.us/global/globe/l_amer/brazil.htm, [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] Forest Service International Programs, retrieved February 2007.</ref>

With abundant [[fauna]] and [[flora]], Brazil is home to many thousands of species, most of them still undiscovered. By 2020, it is estimated that at least 50% of the species resident in Brazil will become extinct.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

As several of these specimens possess special characteristics, or are built in an interesting way, some of their capabilities may be copied for use in technology (see [[bionics]]).{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The revenues derived from such plans may still hold the key to preserve the country's animal and plant species.

There is general consensus, that Brazil has the highest number of both terrestrial vertebrates and invertebrates of any country in the world. This high diversity of fauna can be explained by the sheer size of Brazil and also the great variation in ecosystems. The numbers published about Brazil's fauna diversity can vary from source to source, as taxonomists sometimes disagree about species classifications and information can be incomplete or out of date. Also new species continue to be discovered and, sadly, some species go extinct in the wild. Brazil has the highest primate diversity of any country in the world with 77 species and fresh water fish (over 3000 species), it claims the second-highest number of amphibian species, the third highest number of bird species and is ranked fifth in reptile species. Many of the species that are at risk live in threatened habitats such as the [[Atlantic Forest]].

== Demographics ==
[[Image:Kuarup3.jpg|right|thumb|[[Indigenous people of Brazil]]]]
{{main|Demographics of Brazil}}
Brazil's population is very diverse, comprising many races and [[ethnic group]]s. In general, Brazilians are mostly come from four sources of [[migration]]:

# [[Amerindians]], Brazil's indigenous population, came from human groups that migrated from [[Siberia]] across the [[Bering Strait]] around 9000 BC.
# [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonists and settlers, arriving from 1500 onward.
# Diverse groups of [[immigrant]]s from [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] arriving in Brazil during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
# [[Africa]]n [[slave]]s brought to the country from 1530 until the end of the slave trade in 1850.

It is believed that the Americas were settled by three migratory waves from Northern Asia. The Brazilian Indians are thought to be descended from the first wave of migrants, who arrived in the region around 9000 BC. The main Native Brazilian groups were the [[Tupi]]-[[Guarani]], the [[J<U+00EA>]], the [[Arawaks]] and the Caraibas ([[Caribs]]). The [[Tupi]]-[[Guarani]] nation, originally from the [[Parana river]] basin and also the main of Native-[[Paraguay]]an nations, had spread all along the Brazilian coastline from South to North and got to be known by the Portuguese as "Os <U+00CD>ndios da L<U+00ED>ngua Geral" ("The Indians of the General Language"); the [[J<U+00EA>]] nation occupied the most of the interior of the country from [[Maranh<U+00E3>o]] to [[Santa Catarina]]. The [[Arawaks]] and the [[Caribs]], the last ones to get in contact with the Portuguese, lived in the North and Northwest of Brazil.

The [[Europe]]an [[immigration to Brazil]] started in the sixteenth century, the vast majority of them coming from [[Portugal]]. In the first two centuries of colonization, 100,000 Portuguese arrived in Brazil (around 500 colonists per year). In the eighteenth century, 600,000 Portuguese arrived (6,000 per year). The first region to be settled by the Portuguese was [[Northeastern Brazil]], followed by the [[Southeastern Brazil|Southeastern]] region. The interior began to be settled during the eighteenth century. The Portuguese were the only ethnic group to settle across Brazil.  

The original Amerindian population of Brazil (between three and five million) has in large part been exterminated or assimilated into the Portuguese population. The [[Mameluco]]s (or [[Caboclo]]s, mixed-race between [[Whites]] and Indians) have always been present in many parts of Brazil.
[[Image:Parque_Barigui%2C_Curitiba%2C_Brazil.jpg|right|thumb|View of [[Curitiba]], capital of [[Paran<U+00E1> state]].]]

Another important ethnic group, [[Africa]]ns, first arrived as slaves. At first many came from [[Guinea]], although by the end of the eighteenth century many had been taken from [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] (or, in [[Bahia]], from [[Nigeria]]). By the time of the end of the slave trade in 1850, around three to five million slaves had been brought to Brazil &ndash; 37% of all slave traffic between Africa and the Americas. At the time of slavery a mixed people came out through rapes or affairs between white masters and  black or Indian  slaves.

The large influx of European immigrants to Brazil occurred in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Between 1870 and 1930, more than 5 million immigrants entered Brazil. These immigrants were divided in two groups: a part of them was sent to [[Southern Brazil]] to work as small [[farm]]ers. However, the biggest part of the immigrants was sent to [[Southeastern Brazil]] to work in the [[coffee]] [[plantation]]s. The immigrants sent to Southern Brazil were mainly [[Germans]] (starting in 1824, mainly from [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Pomerania]], [[Hamburg]], [[Westphalia]], etc) and [[Italians]] (starting in 1875, mainly from the [[Veneto]] and [[Lombardia]]). In the South, the immigrants established rural communities that, still today, have a strong cultural connection  with their ancestral homelands. In Southeastern Brazil most of the immigrants were Italians (mainly from the [[Veneto]], [[Campania]], [[Calabria]] and [[Lombardia]]), Portuguese (mainly from [[Beira Alta]], [[Minho (province)|Minho]] and [[Alto Tr<U+00E1>s-os-Montes]]), [[Spaniards]] (mainly from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Andalusia]]).

[[Image:00040_copy.jpg|thumb|right|[[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] is the largest Brazilian city and the financial capital of the country. It is one of the largest [[metropolis|metropolises]] in the world.]]
Notably, the early part of the twentieth century saw a large influx of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] (mainly from [[Honsh<U+016B>]] and [[Okinawa]]) and [[Arab]]s (from [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]).  These Arab immigrants were -and still are- wrongly called "[[Turkish people|Turks]]" by many [[Brazilian]]s because their original countries were still under Turkish rule back in the times Arab immigration to Brazil began.  The number of actual [[Turkish people|Turks]] who immigrated to Brazil was very few, if not even insignificant.

[[Image:Rio_de_Janeiro_-_P%C3%A3o_de_A%C3%A7ucar_-_Cablecar.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sugar Loaf]], in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the second largest city of Brazil.]]
According to the ''Memorial do Imigrante'',<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Memorial do Imigrante |work= |publisher= |date= |url=http://www.memorialdoimigrante.sp.gov.br Memorial do Imigrante |format= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Brazil attracted nearly 5.5 million immigrants between [[1870]] and [[1953]]: approximately 1,550,000 [[Italo-Brazilian|Italians]], 1,470,000 Portuguese, 650,000 Spaniards, 210,000 Germans, 190,000 Japanese, 120,000 [[Poles]] and 650,000 of many other nationalities.

Brazil's population is mostly concentrated along the coast, with a lower population density in the interior. The population of the southern states is mainly of European descent, while the majority of the inhabitants of the north and northeast are of mixed ancestry (Amerindians, Africans and Europeans)

According to the Brazilian constitution of 1988, racism is an unbailable crime and must be met with imprisonment.

{{main|Languages of Brazil}}
{{seealso|Brazilian Portuguese}}
[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the only official language of Brazil. It is spoken by nearly the entire population and is virtually the only language used in schools, newspapers, radio, TV and for all business and administrative purposes. Moreover, Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in [[the Americas]], making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity. 

Portuguese as spoken in Brazil has developed independently of the European mother tongue, and it has undergone fewer phonetic changes than the language spoken in Portugal, thus it is often said that the "[[language]] of [[Cam<U+00F5>es]]", who lived in the fifteenth century, sounded closer to modern Brazilian Portuguese, than to the language spoken in Portugal today, and that his work is poetically more perfect when read the Brazilian way.

===Minority languages===
[[Image:Regi<U+00E3>o_da_Liberdade_-_S<U+00E3>o_Paulo_-_Brasil.JPG|right|thumb|200px|In [[Liberdade]], a district of [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] settled by [[Japanese-Brazilian|Japanese]] immigrants.]]
Many Amerindian languages are spoken daily in indigenous communities, primarily in Northern Brazil. Although many of these communities have significant contact with Portuguese, today there are incentives for teaching and preserving native languages. In 2006, the City of [[Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira]] in the region of Cabe<U+00E7>a do Cachorro (Northwestern region of the State of [[Amazonas]]), has adopted some indigenous languages as some of its other official languages along with [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

Other languages are spoken by descendants of immigrants, who are usually bilingual, in small rural communities in Southern Brazil. The most important are the [[Brazilian German]] dialects, such as [[Riograndenser Hunsr<U+00FC>ckisch]] and the [[Pomeranian language]], and also the [[Talian]], based on the [[Italian Language|Italian]] [[Venetian language]]. In the city of [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] can be heard in the immigrant neighbourhoods, like [[Liberdade]]. Polish is spoken in the city of Guarani das Miss<U+00F5>es, Ukrainian in  Prudentopolis  and Hugarian in Jaragu<U+00E1> do Sul, cities where these immigrants groups are a majority.


[[English language|English]] is spoken in the region of Americana City by the descendents of the Southern Confederates that settled there and in the region bordering Guyana. English is also part of the official high school curriculum in most of the Brazilian states, but few Brazilians are truly fluent in the language, even in Brazilian universities. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is understood to varying degrees by many Brazilians, especially on the borders with Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. The same applies to French which is spoken  and understood in the cities bordering the French Guyana.

== Social issues ==
===Poverty and economic inequality===
According to [[Funda<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Getulio Vargas]], in [[June]] [[2006]] the rate of poverty based into lacework was of 18.57% of the population - a 19.8% reduction during the previous four years.<ref> [http://www.fgv.br/cps/pesquisas/miseria_queda_grafico_clicavel/Grafico_Miseria.pdf FGV - Gr<U+00E1>fico Mis<U+00E9>ria]</ref> The rate of poverty is in part attributed to the country's [[economic inequality]]. Brazil ranks among the world's highest nations in the [[Gini coefficient]] index of inequality assessment.

[[Image:RiodeJaneiro-Favela.jpg|thumb|right|Entrenched between some of the richer areas of [[Rio de Janeiro]], the [[Vidigal]] ''[[favela]]'' is testimony to high [[economic inequality]] within Brazil.]]
Poverty in Brazil is most visually represented by the various ''[[favela]]s'', [[slum]]s in the country's metropolitan areas and remote upcountry regions that suffer with economic underdevelopment and below-par standards of living. There are also great differences in wealth and welfare between regions.<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=PIB dos munic<U+00ED>pios revela concentra<U+00E7><U+00E3>o e desigualdades na gera<U+00E7><U+00E3>o de renda |work= |publisher= |date= |url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/presidencia/noticias/noticia_visualiza.php?id_noticia=354&id_pagina=1 |format= |doi= |accessdate=2007-02-22}}</ref> While the Northeast region has the worst [[economic indicator]]s nationwide due to low coverage and quality of public services and widespread [[corruption]], many cities in the South and Southeast enjoy [[First World]] [[socioeconomic]] standards.<ref> [http://www.fundaj.gov.br/docs/pe/pe0114.html]</ref> In [[2005]], Brazil had more than 15 million (10.2%) people that were considered to be [[Illiteracy|illiterate]].<ref>
[http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/trabalhoerendimento/pnad2005/sintesepnad2005.pdf]</ref>

A recent attempt to mitigate these problems is the "''[[Fome Zero]]''" hunger-eradication program implemented by President [[Luiz In<U+00E1>cio Lula da Silva]].  Part of this is "''[[Bolsa Fam<U+00ED>lia]]''", a major anti-poverty program that gives money directly to impoverished families.

==Culture==
[[Image:Museu de Arte Contempor<U+00E2>nea.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Niter<U+00F3>i Contemporary Art Museum]].]]
{{main|Culture of Brazil}} 
The core culture of Brazil is rooted in the [[culture of Portugal]]. The Portuguese [[colonist]]s and immigrants brought the [[Roman Catholic]] [[faith]], the Portuguese language and many [[tradition]]s and customs that still influence the modern-day Brazilian culture.

As a multiracial country, its culture also absorbed other influences. The Amerindian peoples influenced Brazil's language and [[Cuisine of Brazil|cuisine]] and the Africans, brought as slaves, largely influenced [[Music of Brazil|Brazil's music]], [[dance]], cuisine, religion and language. The [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] traditions, from nowadays Southwest [[Nigeria]] had made its way strongly into Afro-Brazilian religion and into Brazilian religiousness as a whole. Ancient [[Yoruba mythology|Yoruba]] [[Orishas]] (gods) like [[Shango]] and [[Oxum]] are largely worshipped in Brazil, while the [[Samba]] and the [[Capoeira]] (musical rhythm and martial art, respectively) were originally contributions from the [[Bantus|Bantu peoples]] from [[Angola]].

[[Italy|Italian]], [[Germany|German]] and other European [[immigrant]]s came in large numbers and their influences are felt closer to the Southeast and South of Brazil.

===Religion===
[[Image:Redentor.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]] statue in [[Rio de Janeiro]] is the most famous landmark in Brazil.]]
{{main|Religion in Brazil}}
According to the [http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/ IBGE] census:<ref>[http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/censo2000/populacao/religiao_Censo2000.pdf Official data on Religion distribution in Brazil]</ref>
* 74% are [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] (about 139 million).
* 15.4% are [[Protestant]]s (about 28 million).
* {{spaces|2}}7.4% consider themselves [[Agnosticism|agnostics]], [[Atheism|atheists]] or without a religion (about 12 million).
* {{spaces|2}}1.3% are followers of [[Spiritism]] (about 2.2 million).
* {{spaces|2}}0.3% are followers of African traditional religions such as [[Candombl<U+00E9>]] and [[Umbanda]].
* {{spaces|2}}1.7% are members of other religions. Some of these are [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (1,100,000), [[Buddhism]] (215,000), [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saints]] (199,645), [[Judaism]] (87,000), and [[Islam in Brazil|Islam]] (27,000).
* Some practice a mixture of different religions, such as Catholicism, Candombl<U+00E9>, and indigenous American religion combined.

Brazil has the largest [[Roman Catholicism in Brazil|Roman Catholic]] population in the world.

Followers of [[Protestantism]] are rising in number.  Until 1970, the majority of Brazilian Protestants were the ones of "traditional churches", mostly [[Lutheran]]s, [[Presbyterian]]s and [[Baptist]]s. Since then, numbers of [[Pentecostal]] and Neopentecostal adherents have increased significantly.

[[Islam in Brazil]] was first practiced by African slaves.  Today, the Muslim population in Brazil is made up of mostly [[Arab]] immigrants. A recent trend has been the increase in conversions to Islam among non-Arab citizens.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71451.htm]</ref>

The largest population of [[Buddhim|Buddhists]] in Latin America lives in Brazil.  This is mostly because Brazil has the largest [[Japanese-Brazilian|Japanese]] population outside [[Japan]].

Brazil appears as a devout country to outsiders yet in an [[IBOPE]] poll, about 8% of Brazilians declared themselves to be non-religious (with 2% declaring themselves atheists) and 58% of Catholics considered themselves "not very practicing" or "not at all practicing".<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Pesquisa de Opini<U+00E3>o dos Cat<U+00F3>licos Brasileiros sobre Direitos Reprodutivos, Rela<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Igreja-Estado e temas Relacionados , "Aborto e Temas Relacionados" |work= |publisher= |date= |url=http://www.ibope.com.br/opiniao_publica/downloads/opp008_catolicos_brasileiros_nucleo1.pdf |format=pdf |doi= |accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref>

===Sports===
{{main|Sports in Brazil}}
The most popular sport in Brazil is [[Football (soccer)|football]], and the country is renowned for the quality of its players, including [[Pel<U+00E9>]], [[Garrincha]], [[Jairzinho]], [[Rivelino]], [[Carlos Alberto Torres|Carlos Alberto]], [[Roberto Dinamite]], [[Edmundo]], [[Zico]], [[S<U+00F3>crates]], [[Rom<U+00E1>rio]], [[Ronaldo]], [[Cafu]], [[Rivaldo]], [[Roberto Carlos]], [[Juninho Pernambucano|Juninho]], [[Adriano Leite Ribeiro|Adriano]], [[Diego Ribas da Cunha|Diego]], [[Robinho]], [[Ronaldinho]], [[Mancini]], and [[Kak<U+00E1>]]. The [[Brazilian national football team]] (''Sele<U+00E7><U+00E3>o''), has been victorious in the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] tournament a record five times. They are widely regarded as the most talented national team, despite not winning the 2006 World Cup. Eight Brazilian clubs have won [[Copa Libertadores]], the biggest South American clubs tournament.
[[Image:Estadio_morumbi.jpg|thumb|[[Morumbi Stadium]]]]
Brazil has also achieved success in other international sports, mainly [[volleyball]], [[basketball]], [[tennis]], [[gymnastics]], [[judo]] and [[auto racing]].
Recently, Brazil's volleyball team has achieved victory in almost every championship played.

Sports created in Brazil:
*[[Beach soccer]], created in the beaches of [[Rio de Janeiro]].
*[[Footvolley]], a mix of [[football]] and [[volleyball]], also played in sand.
*[[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]], a variation of [[judo]].
*[[Vale tudo]], a fight sport.
*[[Capoeira]], a [[martial art]] of African heritage.
*''[[Futsal]]'', or ''Futebol de Sal<U+00E3>o'', the official version of indoor soccer.

{{main|Science and technology in Brazil}}
Some of Brazil's most important technology nodes are located in [[S<U+00E3>o Jos<U+00E9> dos Campos]], [[Campinas]], [[S<U+00E3>o Carlos]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Curitiba]], [[Porto Alegre]], [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Recife]] and [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]].

Brazilian [[information technology]] is comparable to other countries who play a major role in the international market, like [[India]] and [[China]] but with a bigger internal market, the exports of software still limited.<ref>[http://www.bndes.gov.br/conhecimento/seminario/EugenioStaub.pdf Panorama da Ind<U+00FA>stria Brasileira de Eletro-Eletr<U+00F4>nica e Software</ref> Catering for the internal market, Brazilian IT is particularly efficient in [[financial services]], [[Defense industry|defense]], [[CRM]], [[eGovernment]], and [[healthcare]].
