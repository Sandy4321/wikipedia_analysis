'''Mar<U+00ED>a Luisa C<U+00E1>ceres D<U+00ED>az de Arismendi''' (September 25, 1799 <U+2013> June 28, 1866) was a heroine of the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]].

==The beginning of the war==
Luisa was born in Caracas, Venezuela, to Jos<U+00E9> Domingo C<U+00E1>ceres and Carmen D<U+00ED>az, prosperous [[Criollo people|Criollos]]. On her father's side, she was of [[Canarian people|Canarian]] descent. She was baptized in the [[Church of Santa Rosal<U+00ED>a]], in Caracas. Her father was an intellectual, an historian and a professor of [[Latin]]. Educated by her father, Luisa learned how to read and write, and developed a love for her country. While Luisa was a young girl focussing on her studies, [[Spain]] was taken over by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], who installed his brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]], as its king. People not just in Spain, but in its [[Spanish Empire|colonies]] as well, were infuriated, and [[Peninsular War|a war for Spain's independence]] broke out. In Venezuela, Spanish [[colonists]] saw this as an opportunity to break away from Spain while it was weak, and gain independence, and so a series of uprisings occurred. They were led by the Venezuelan [[marshal]] [[Francisco de Miranda]], who had been involved in the [[French Revolution]] and the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Venezuela declared itself  independent from Spain on July 5, 1811. This triggered the  war for Venezuela's independence. In 1812, an [[1812 Caracas earthquake|enormous earthquake struck Caracas]], where Luisa and her family were living, completely destroying the city. Because of this earthquake and  a rebellion by the Venezuelan ''[[Llaneros]]'' and Canarians, the [[First Republic of Venezuela]] was toppled. A second Venezuelan republic was proclaimed on August 7, 1813, but lasted only a few months before it, too, was crushed.

On [[Christmas Eve]] 1813, Luisa met the General [[Juan Bautista Arismendi]], a scion of the illustrious [[Arismendi]] family, who was impressed by her wit. On March 6, 1814, the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalist]] troops of Francisco Rosete attacked [[Ocumare de la Costa de Oro Municipality|Ocumare]], killing her father, who was visiting his friend, Commandant Juan Jos<U+00E9> Toro. Juan Bautista Arismendi organized an expedition to Ocumare, to rescue imprisoned patriots; Luisa's brother, F<U+00E9>lix, joined the expeditionary force but was captured and, a few days later, executed . [[Jos<U+00E9> Tom<U+00E1>s Boves]] forced the patriot troops to abandon the Plaza de Caracas. The retreat (known in Venezuela as the ''Migration to the East'')was led by [[Sim<U+00F3>n Bol<U+00ED>var]] and [[Jos<U+00E9> F<U+00E9>lix Ribas]]. Luisa's family decided to emigrate to [[Isla Margarita]], where Arismendi offered security. During the trip, four of her aunts died, and only she, her mother, and her younger brother survived. The emigrants passed through the cities of [[Barcelona, Venezuela|Barcelona]] and  [[Cuman<U+00E1>]], which was taken over by Boves.

In Margarita, Arismendi located the C<U+00E1>ceres family, whom he had known for some time and provided them with clothing, housing, and other necessities. He and Luisa married on December 4, 1814, in [[La Asunci<U+00F3>n]], when he was thirty-nine years of age and she just fifteen. In 1815, Juan was made provisional governor of Margarita, at the same time [[Pablo Morillo]], a royalist general, with a squad that had never been seen of the coast of Venezuela. In September, the Spanish ordered the apprehension of Juan, who consequently sought refuge in the mountains of Copey. On September 24, the pregnant Luisa was captured by the Spanish in order to exert pressure on her husband. She was kept under house arrest at the residence of the Amn<U+00E9>s family, but was later transferred to a dungeon in the Fortress of Santa Rosa.

==Imprisonment==

[[Image:LuisaPlaque.JPG|thumb|left| A plaque at the Santa Rosa Fortress commemorating where Luisa was imprisoned. Translated to English, it reads: "Luisa C de Arismendi for her virtue, valour and martyrdom for husband and country. Held captive in this jail at sixteen years old.]]

It was in that dark dungeon that Luisa began to be harassed and abused by the Spanish soldiers. She was under strict surveillance, and given poor food, and began to experience malnutrition. She spent many days and nights without much movement, so that she wouldn't call the attention of her jailer. However, the chaplain began to feel for her, and started bringing her better food , and even lit up the cell so she could have some light. On January 26, 1816, Luisa gave birth to a daughter; however the baby died quickly after birth, due to the poor conditions her mother was in during her last few months of pregnancy.

In 1815, she was detained by the Spanish authorities with the purpose of pressing her husband Arismendi, who was by then battling a fierce campaign against the Royal Spanish forces. However, the island's governor, Joaqu<U+00ED>n Urreiztieta, did not obtain anything from her and her husband which means that Luisa stayed imprisoned in Santa Rosa fortress <U+2013>where she delivered a baby girl who died at childbirth<U+2013> until she was transferred to the Pampatar fortress, afterwards to [[La Guaira]] and finally she was sent to Spain (1816), where she was also victim of tortures to make her relinquish her republican ideals. The [[brigadier generals]], Juan Bautista Pardo and Salvador Mox<U+00F3> ordered Luisa to be transferred to the Castillo San Carlos de Borromeo in [[Pampatar]]. Then she was sent to a prison in [[La Guaira]], and then to El Convento de la Inmaculada Concepci<U+00F3>n, a [[convent]] in Caracas. Throughout the entire time of her confinement, she had been unable to communicate with any family or friends.

== Leaving the Country ==

Due to the victories of the republican army, led by her husband in Margarita and the general Jos<U+00E9> Antonio P<U+00E1>ez in [[Apure]], the brigadier, Mox<U+00F3>, ordered Luisa to be sent all the way to [[C<U+00E1>diz]], in [[Spain]]. She was returned to La Guaira on November 24, 1816, from where she embarked on December 3. On the way, the ship she was on was attacked by [[privateer]] vessel, and she and other passengers were stranded on [[Santa Maria Island]], located in the [[Azores]]. Luisa finally arrived at C<U+00E1>diz on January 17, 1817. She was presented to the [[captain general]] of [[Andalusia]]. He protested against the arbitrary decision of the Spanish authorities in the Americas, and gave Luisa the category of being confined. He gave Luisa a pension of 10 reales a day, and is given protection by the doctor Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Mor<U+00F3>n and his wife, Concepci<U+00F3>n Pepet. They paid a deposit and agreed to present her monthly before a judge.

During her time at C<U+00E1>diz, Luisa refused to sign a document stating her loyalty to the [[king of Spain]], and denying her affiliation as a patriot of Venezuela; she never abandoned her independentist ideals. She still had no news of neither her mother nor her husband. In March 1818, Lieutenant Francisco Caraba<U+00F1>a and the [[Englishman]], Mr. Tottem, offered to help Luisa get back to the Americas. As they planned her escape, Luisa promised that her husband would pay all the expenses in the end. Luisa said her goodbyes to the Mor<U+00F3>n family, and headed to the [[United States of America]] on a [[frigate]].

On May 3, 1818, Luisa arrived at the city of [[Philadelphia]]. There, she met the family of the patriotic general Lino Clemente, who had moved to the United States. They provieded her with hospitality and friendship, just as the Mor<U+00F3>n family had in Spain. [[Colonel]] Luis Rieux, sent by Luisa's husband, went to Philadelphia to transfer her to Margarita. They arrived on July 26, 1818. Subsequently, on September 19, 1819, the [[Council of the Indies]] dictated a resolution by means of which Luisa was granted absolute liberty to choose her residence. She went on to have a total of eleven children. She continued to support the ideas of freedom and sovereignty of the people of the Americas. She lived in the city of Caracas until her death in 1866.

== Honors ==

*In recognition of her loyalty and fight for the independence of Venezuela, her remains were entombed in the [[Pante<U+00F3>n Nacional]] in 1876; she was the first woman to be given this honor.

*A statue of her was erected in a plaza, named after her, in the small town of La Asunci<U+00F3>n, where she was married.

*Today, in Caracas, there is the ''University Institute Luisa C<U+00E1>ceres de Arismendi''.

*She is pictured on the 20 [[Bolivar Fuerte]] banknote, which was introduced by [[Hugo Ch<U+00E1>vez]] on January 1, 2008.
