'''Ma'a Allan Nonu''' ({{IPA2|m<U+0251><U+02D0><U+0294><U+0251> n<U+0252>nu<U+02D0>}}, born 21 May 1982 in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]]) is a professional [[rugby union]] player from New Zealand. Nonu plays for the [[Wellington Lions]] in the [[National Provincial Championship|NPC]], the [[Wellington Hurricanes|Hurricanes]] in the [[Super 14]], and the New Zealand [[All Blacks]]. He plays in the [[Rugby_union_positions#13._Outside_centre_.26_12._Inside_centre|centre]] position, but can also cover [[Rugby_union_positions#13._Outside_centre_.26_12._Inside_centre|second five-eighth]] and [[Rugby_union_positions#14. and 11. Wing|wing]].

Of [[Samoa|Samoan]] descent, Nonu is known for his blonde-streaked dreadlocks and former penchant for wearing eyeliner on the field. He is equally well-known for his explosiveness and powerful attacking runs and regularly breaks the defensive line at will. He has enough speed to play on the wing, but lacks the raw pace of a specialist in the position. All Blacks coach [[Graham Henry]] has described him as "probably the best linebreaker in this game in this country."[http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/410965/611426] Henry and his All Blacks coaching predecessor [[John Mitchell (rugby player)|John Mitchell]] have mainly used Nonu as an impact player off the bench in Tests. He has started only 4 of his 12 Tests.

Nonu has a similar attacking skillset to former All Black centre [[Tana Umaga]]: like Umaga, he is an exceptional [[crash ball]] runner who excels at breaking the line and creating space for outside backs. In 2005, Henry described Nonu as "young Tana,"[http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/410965/611426] underlining the impression that he was being groomed as a potential successor to Umaga.

==Career overview==

Nonu attended [[Rongotai College]] in Wellington. He played for Wellington Secondary Schools in 1999-2000 and Wellington Under 19s in 2001. He made his provincial debut for Wellington in the 2002 NPC and debuted for the Hurricanes in the 2003 Super 12. He played for the New Zealand [[rugby sevens|Sevens]] in 2004. On the back of some outstanding Super 12 form, Nonu made his Test debut for the All Blacks on June 14, 2003, starting at centre in a 15-13 loss to [[England national rugby union team|England]].

Nonu missed selection for the 2003 [[Tri Nations]], with the selecters preferring Umaga, [[Aaron Mauger]] and [[Daniel Carter (rugby player)|Daniel Carter]] in the midfield. He was selected for the All Blacks' [[2003 Rugby Union World Cup|2003 World Cup]] squad and played in pool matches against [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]], [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]] and [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga]]. He scored his first Test try against Canada and was generally impressive on attack. However, question marks over his defensive game and inexperience meant he was not selected for the knockout stage of the tournament despite an injury to Umaga.

Nonu missed selection for the Tri Nations in 2004 after a form slump in the Super 12. He forced his way back into contention playing for Wellington in the 2004 NPC, and played as a substitute in all four matches on the All Blacks' undefeated end of year tour to Europe.

Nonu played on the wing for much of the 2005 Super 12, with [[Conrad Smith]] preferred as Umaga's midfield partner. Standout performances included a hat trick against 2004 Super 12 champions the [[ACT Brumbies|Brumbies]]. Nonu played at second five-eighth for the Possibles in the 2005 All Blacks trial, scoring two tries and setting up two more to inspire the Possibles to an upset win over the Probables. He played in the [[2005_British_and_Irish_Lions_tour_to_New_Zealand#Second_Test|second Test]] against the 2005 [[British and Irish Lions]] as a substitute, replacing [[Sitiveni Sivivatu]] on the wing. He again missed selection for the 2005 Tri Nations.

Wellington Lions captain Umaga was rested during the 2005 NPC, and in his absence Nonu was promoted to the captaincy of the team. During the NPC, he established himself as one of New Zealand's most dangerous midfield runners. He was selected for the 2005 All Blacks [[Grand Slam (Rugby Union)|Grand Slam]] tour, playing Tests as a substitute against [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] and [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]], and earning his third Test start against [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]]. He was cited for an alleged [[spear tackle]] against [[Gordon D'Arcy]] during the Test against Ireland, but was later cleared of the charge.

In 2006 Ma'a Nonu was ruled out of the Tri Nations squad due to injury, [[Mils Muliaina]] being chosen to take his place. He damaged the base of his left thumb playing club rugby in Wellington, which required him to have surgery. He will, however, be included in the end of year tour with the All Blacks. 

Due to his absence from the All Blacks Tri Nations squad Ma'a Nonu was able to play every game with the [[Wellington Lions]] in the [[Air New Zealand Cup]], which greatly helped them.

In a stunning admission, Nonu has expressed a desire to play in the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) after next years RWC. Nonu said: 

'''''"I watch a lot of rugby league and really love the game. Over the past couple of days I have met some of the superstars I watch on TV."'''''

'''''"I support the [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Bulldogs]],"''''' he said, adding he had family in Sydney. 

'''''"[[Terry Lamb]] (former Canterbury five-eighth) was one of my heroes and I watch the boys every game. "'''''

NRL boss [[David Gallop]] believes the Kiwi colossus would be a success in league.

'''''"He is obviously a class player,''''' he said. 

'''''"The intensity at both club and representative level (in the NRL) attracts these marquee players."'''''
