'''Stephen I''', also''' Saint Stephen,''' ({{lang-hu|I. Szent Istv<U+00E1>n}}; {{lang-la|Sanctus Stephanus}};{{sfn|Zsoldos|2001|p=36}} {{lang-sk|<U+0160>tefan I. or <U+0160>tefan Ve<U+013E>k<U+00FD>}}) was the last [[Grand Prince of the Hungarians]] between 997 and 1000 or 1001, and the first [[King of Hungary]] from 1000 or 1001 until his death in 1038. He was born as '''Vajk''' in [[Esztergom]]. The year of his birth is uncertain, but many details of his life suggest that he was born in or after 975. He was the only son of Grand Prince [[G<U+00E9>za, Grand Prince of the Hungarians|G<U+00E9>za]] and his wife, [[Sarolt]], who was descended from the prominent family of the ''[[Gyula (title)|gyulas]]''. Although both of his parents were baptized, Stephen was the first  member of [[<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>ds|his family]] to become a devout Christian. He married [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela of Bavaria]], a scion of the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty]].

After succeeding his father in 997, Stephen had to fight for the throne against his relative, [[Kopp<U+00E1>ny]], who was supported by masses of pagan warriors. He defeated Kopp<U+00E1>ny mainly with the assistance of [[Vecelin]], [[Hont-P<U+00E1>zm<U+00E1>ny#Notable members of the clan|Hont and P<U+00E1>zm<U+00E1>ny]] and other knights of foreign origin, but also with help from native lords. He was crowned on 25 December 1000 or 1 January 1001 with a crown sent by [[Pope Sylvester II]]. In a series of wars against semi-independent tribes and chieftains{{mdash}}including the [[Black Hungarians]] and his uncle, [[Gyula III|Gyula the Younger]]{{mdash}}he unified the [[Carpathian Basin]]. He protected the independence of his kingdom by forcing the invading troops of [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor]] to withdraw from Hungary in 1030.

Stephen established at least one archbishopric, six bishoprics and three Benedictine monasteries; thus the Church in Hungary developed independently of the archbishops of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. He ensured the spread of Christianity among his subjects with severe punishments. His system of local administration was based on [[Counties of the Kingdom of Hungary|counties]] organized around fortresses and administered by [[Isp<U+00E1>n|royal officials]]. Hungary, which enjoyed a lasting period of peace during his reign, became a preferred route for [[pilgrims]] and merchants traveling between [[Western Europe]] and the [[Holy Land]] or [[Constantinople]].

He survived all of his children, which caused bitter conflicts among his relatives, lasting for decades. He died on 15 August 1038 and was buried in his new basilica, built in [[Sz<U+00E9>kesfeh<U+00E9>rv<U+00E1>r]] and dedicated to the [[Holy Virgin]]. [[Pope Gregory VII]] [[canonized]] him together with his son, [[Saint Emeric of Hungary|Emeric]], and Bishop [[Gerardo Sagredo|Gerard of Csan<U+00E1>d]] ([[Cenad]], [[Romania]]), in 1083. Stephen is a popular saint in [[Hungary]] and the neighboring territories. In Hungary, his [[feast day]] (celebrated on 20 August) is also a [[Public holidays in Hungary|public holiday]] commemorating the foundation of the state.

==Early years (c. 975<U+2013>997)==

The date of his birth is uncertain, because it was not recorded in contemporaneous documents.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=64}} Hungarian and Polish chronicles written centuries later give three different years: 967, 969 and 975.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=15}} The unanimous testimony of his legends and other Hungarian sources, which state that Stephen was "still an adolescent"<ref>''Hartvic, Life of King Stephen of Hungary'' (ch. 5), p. 381.</ref> in 997, substantiate the reliability of the later year (975).{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=64}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=15}} Stephen's ''Lesser Legend'' adds that he was born in Esztergom.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=64}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=15}}<ref name=Britannica>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Stephen I|url=http://britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/565415/Stephen-I|encyclopedia=[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica, Inc.|year=2008|accessdate=2008-07-29}}</ref> His place of birth also implies that he was born after 972, because his father, [[G<U+00E9>za, Grand Prince of the Hungarians]], chose Esztergom as royal residence around that year.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=64}}

Hungarian chronicles unanimously report that Stephen's mother was [[Sarolt]], a daughter of [[Gyula II|Gyula]], the Hungarian [[gyula (title)|chieftain]] with jurisdiction either in [[Transylvania]]{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=44}} or in the wider region of the confluence of the rivers [[Tisza]] and [[Maros]].{{sfn|S<U+0103>l<U+0103>gean|2005|p=147}} Many historians{{mdash}}including P<U+00E1>l Engel and Gyula Krist<U+00F3>{{mdash}}propose that her father was identical with "Gylas", who had around 952 been baptized in [[Constantinople]] and "remained faithful to Christianity",<ref>''John Skylitzes: A Synopsis of Byzantine History, 811<U+2013>1057'' (ch. 11.5.), p. 231.</ref> according to the Byzantine chronicler, [[John Skylitzes]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=24}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=28}} However, this identification is not unanimously accepted; for instance, [[Gy<U+00F6>rgy Gy<U+00F6>rffy]] proposes that it was not Sarolt's father, but his younger brother who was baptized in the Byzantine capital.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=44}} In contrast with all Hungarian sources, the ''[[Polish-Hungarian Chronicle]]'' and later [[Poles|Polish]] sources state that Stephen's mother was Adelhaid, an otherwise unknown sister of Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland]], but the reliability of this report is dubious.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=46}}
[[File:Benczur-vajk.jpg|thumb|left|190px|alt=Painting by Gyula Bencz<U+00FA>r|''Baptism of Vajk'', painting by [[Gyula Bencz<U+00FA>r]]]]
He was born as [[Vajk (given name)|Vajk]],<ref name=Britannica/>{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=27}} which derived from a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] word ''baj'', meaning "hero", "master", "prince", or "rich".{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=15}}{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=46}} Stephen's ''Greater Legend'' narrates that he was baptized by Bishop [[Adalbert of Prague]],{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=78}} who stayed in G<U+00E9>za's court several times between 983 and 994.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=329}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=16}} However, Adalbert's nearly contemporaneous ''Legend'', written by [[Bruno of Querfurt]], does not mention of the event.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=329}}{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=78}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=16}}  Accordingly, the date of Stephen's baptism is unknown: Gy<U+00F6>rffy argues that Stephen was baptized soon after birth,{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=78}} while Krist<U+00F3> proposes that he only received baptism just before his father's death in 997.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=16}} He was given his [[baptismal name]] in honour of the first martyr, [[Saint Stephen]].

Stephen's ''Legend'', written by [[Hartvik]], narrates that he "was fully instructed in knowledge of the grammatical art"<ref name=Hartvic>''Hartvic, Life of King Stephen of Hungary'' (ch. 4), p. 381.</ref> in his childhood, implying that he studied [[Latin language|Latin]].{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=15}} His two other legends do not mention Stephen's grammatical studies. They only state that he "was brought up by receiving an education appropriate for a little prince".{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=15}} Krist<U+00F3> says that the latter remark only refers to Stephen's physical training, including his participation in hunts and military actions.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=15}} According to the ''Illuminated Chronicle'', one of his tutors was a Count Deodatus from [[Kingdom of Italy (imperial)|Italy]], who later founded a monastery in [[Tata, Hungary|Tata]].{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1983|p=132}}

According to Stephen's legends, Grand Prince G<U+00E9>za convoked an assembly of the Hungarian chieftains and warriors when Stephen "ascended to the first stage of adolescence",<ref name=Hartvic/> when he was 14 or 15.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|pp=79-80}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=17}} G<U+00E9>za nominated Stephen as his successor and all those who were present took an oath of loyalty to the young prince.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=17}} Gy<U+00F6>rgy Gy<U+00F6>rffy also writes, without referring to his source, that G<U+00E9>za appointed his son to rule the "[[Principality of Nitra|Nyitra ducate]]" around that time.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=78}} [[Slovaks|Slovak]] historians, including J<U+00E1>n Steinh<U+00FC>bel and J<U+00E1>n Luka<U+010D>ka, accept Gy<U+00F6>rffy's view and propose that Stephen administered [[Nyitra]] (now Nitra, Slovakia) from around 995.{{sfn|Steinh<U+00FC>bel|2011|p=19}}{{sfn|Luka<U+010D>ka|2011|p=31}}

Upon his father's initiative,  Stephen married [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela]], the daughter of [[Henry the Wrangler]], [[Duke of Bavaria]] (r. 955<U+2013>995) in or after 995.<ref name="Britannica" />{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|pp=16-17}} This marriage established the first family link between a Hungarian ruler and a Western European ruling house,{{sfn|Moln<U+00E1>r|2001|p = 20}} because Gisella was closely related to the [[Ottonian dynasty]] of the [[Holy Roman Emperors]].{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=16}} According to popular tradition preserved in the [[Scheyern Abbey]] in Bavaria, the ceremony took place at the castle of [[Scheyern]] and was celebrated by Bishop Adalbert of Prague.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=17}} Gisela was accompanied to her new home by [[Bavaria]]n knights, many of whom received land grants from her husband and settled in Hungary.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=81}} The arrival of these heavy-armed warriors strengthened Stephen's military position.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=18}} Gy<U+00F6>rffy writes that Stephen and his wife "presumably" settled in Nyitra after their marriage.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=81}}

Krist<U+00F3> states that the entire conflict between Stephen and Kopp<U+00E1>ny was only a feud between two members of the [[<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d dynasty]], with no effect on other Hungarian tribal leaders.<ref name='Krist<U+00F3>_web'/> Kopp<U+00E1>ny and his troops invaded the northern regions of Transdanubia, took many of Stephen's forts and plundered his lands.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=19}} Stephen, who "was for the first time girded with his sword",<ref>''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 39.64), p. 105.</ref> placed the brothers [[Hont-P<U+00E1>zm<U+00E1>ny#Notable members of the clan|Hont and P<U+00E1>zm<U+00E1>ny]] at the head of his own guard and nominated [[Vecelin]] to lead the royal army.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|pp=63, 83}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=19}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=39}} The latter was a German knight who had come to Hungary in the reign of G<U+00E9>za.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=63}} Hont and P<U+00E1>zm<U+00E1>ny were, according to [[Simon of K<U+00E9>za]]'s ''[[Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum]]'' and the ''Illuminated Chronicle'', "knights of [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabian]] origin"<ref>''Simon of K<U+00E9>za: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 78.), p. 163.</ref> who settled in Hungary either under G<U+00E9>za or in the first years of Stephen's reign.<ref name='Krist<U+00F3>_web'/> On the other hand, Luka<U+010D>ka and other Slovak historians say that Hont and P<U+00E1>zm<U+00E1>ny were "Slovak" noblemen who had joined Stephen during his rule in Nyitra.{{sfn|Luka<U+010D>ka|2011|pp=32-33}}

Kopp<U+00E1>ny was besieging [[Veszpr<U+00E9>m]] when he was informed of the arrival of Stephen's army.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=84}} In the battle between Veszpr<U+00E9>m and [[V<U+00E1>rpalota]],{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=84}} Stephen won a decisive victory over his enemies.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=11}} Kopp<U+00E1>ny himself was killed on the battlefield.{{sfn|Moln<U+00E1>r|2001|p=20}} His body was quartered and its parts were displayed at the gates of the forts of Esztergom, [[Gy<U+0151>r]], [[Gyulafeh<U+00E9>rv<U+00E1>r]] (Alba Iulia, [[Romania]]) and Veszpr<U+00E9>m in order to threaten all of those who were conspiring against the young monarch.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=11}}{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=53}}{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=85}}

When sending one part of Kopp<U+00E1>ny's quartered corpse to Gyulafeh<U+00E9>rv<U+00E1>r, the seat of his maternal uncle, [[Gyula III|Gyula the Younger]], Stephen demonstrated his claim to reign all lands dominated by Hungarian lords.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=20}} He also decided to confirm his international position by adopting the title of king.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=21}} However, the exact circumstances of his coronation and its political consequences are subject to scholarly debate.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}}

Emperor Conrad planned a marriage alliance with the Byzantine Empire and dispatched one of his advisors, Bishop [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Werner of Strasbourg]], to Constantinople.{{sfn|Butler|Cumming|Burns|1998|p=159}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp = 197-198}} The bishop seemingly travelled as a pilgrim, but Stephen, who had been informed on his actual purpose, refused to let him enter into his country in the autumn of 1027.{{sfn|Butler|Cumming|Burns|1998|p=159}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp = 197-198}} Conrad II's biographer, [[Wipo of Burgundy]] narrated that the Bavarians incited skirmishes along the common borders of Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire in 1029, causing a rapid deterioration in relations between the two countries.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p = 149}}{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2003|p = 74}}

Stephen's conflict with [[Ajtony]], a chieftain in the region of the river [[Mure<U+0219> River|Maros]]{{mdash}}which is narrated in the ''Long Life of Saint Gerard''{{mdash}}is also dated by many historians to the very end of the 1020s, although Gy<U+00F6>rffy{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p = 142}} and other scholars wrote that it happened at least a decade earlier.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p = 40}} The conflict arose when Ajtony, who "had taken his power from the Greeks", levied tax on the salt transported to Stephen on the river.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p = 101}} The king sent a large army led by [[Csan<U+00E1>d]] against Ajtony, who was killed in a battle.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p = 142}} His lands were transformed into a [[Csan<U+00E1>d County|county]] and the king set up a [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Szeged-Csan<U+00E1>d|new bishopric at Csan<U+00E1>d]] (Cenad, Romania), the former seat of Ajtony, which was renamed after the commander of the royal army.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p = 142}} According to the ''[[Annales Posonienses]]'', the Venetian Gerard was consecrated as the first bishop of the new diocese in 1030.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|2001|p = 62}}

Emperor Conrad personally led his armies to Hungary in June 1030 and plundered the lands west of the river [[R<U+00E1>ba]].{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p = 149}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p = 231}} However, as the ''Annals of Niederalteich'' reported it, the emperor, suffering from consequences of the [[scorched earth]] tactics applied by the Hungarian army,{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2003|pp = 74-75}} returned to Germany "without an army and without achieving anything, because the army was threatened by starvation and was captured by the Hungarians at [[Vienna]]".{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p = 231}} The peace was restored after Conrad had ceded the lands between the rivers [[Lajta]] and [[Fischa]] to Hungary in the summer of 1031.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|pp = 149-150}}

{{Quote|At this same time, dissensions arose between the Pannonian nation and the Bavarians, through the fault of the Bavarians.

===Last years (1031<U+2013>1038)===
[[File:Imrich stepan.jpg|190px|thumb|right|alt=King St Stephen and his son|King Stephen at the funeral of his son, [[Saint Emeric of Hungary|Saint Emeric]]]]
Stephen's biographer, Hartvic narrates that the king, whose children died one by one in infancy, "restrained the grief over their death by the solace on account of the love of his surviving son",<ref>''Hartvic, Life of King Stephen of Hungary'' (ch. 19), p. 390.</ref> [[Saint Emeric of Hungary|Emeric]].{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=48}} However, Emeric was wounded in a hunting accident and died in 1031.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=16}} After the death of his son, the elderly king could never "fully regain his former health",<ref>''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 45.69), p. 107.</ref> according to the ''Illuminated Chronicle''.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=48}} Krist<U+00F3> writes that the picture, which has been preserved in Stephen's legends, of the holy king keeping the [[vigils]] and washing the feet of paupers, is connected with Stephen's last years, following the death of his son.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=32}}

Emeric's death jeopardized his father's achievements in establishing a Christian state,{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=169}} because Stephen's cousin, [[Vazul]]{{mdash}}who had the strongest claim to succeede him{{mdash}}was suspected to incline toward paganism.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|pp=58-59}} The ''[[Annales Altahenses|Annals of Altaich]]'' narrated that Stephen disregarded his cousin's claim and nominated his own sister's son, the Venetian [[Peter Orseolo]] as his heir.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=170}} The same source adds that Vazul was captured and blinded; his three sons, [[Levente]], [[Andrew I of Hungary|Andrew]] and [[B<U+00E9>la I of Hungary|B<U+00E9>la]], were expelled from Hungary.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=170}} A report, preserved in Stephen's legends, of an unsuccessful attempt upon the elderly king's life by members of his court indicate that Vazul was mutilated for his participation in the plot.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|2001|p=32}} That Vazul's ears were filled with molten lead was only recorded in later sources, including the ''Illuminated Chronicle''.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|pp=169-170}}

Provisions in Stephen's ''Second Book of Laws'' on the "conspiracy against the king and the kingdom"<ref>''Laws of King Stephen I'' (Stephen II:19), p. 11.</ref> implies that this book was promulgated after Vazul's unsuccessful plot against Stephen.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=135}} However, historians have not universally accepted this view.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=135}} Gy<U+00F6>rffy wrote that the law book was issued, not after 1031, but around 1009.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=136}} Likewise, the authenticity of Stephen's decree on the tithe is debated: according to Gy<U+00F6>rffy, it is duly attributed to Stephen, but Berend, Laszlovszky and Szak<U+00E1>cs wrote that it "might be a later addition".{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=136}}{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=351}}

===Founder of Hungary===
[[File:Istvan-ChroniconPictum.jpg|190px|thumb|right|alt=King St Stephen in the Illuminated Chronicle|A miniature of King Saint Stephen from the ''[[Illuminated Chronicle]]'']]
Stephen has always been considered one of the most important statesmen in the history of Hungary.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=51}} His main achievement was the establishment of a Christian state which ensured that the Hungarians have survived in the Carpathian Basin, in contrast with the [[Huns]], [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] and other peoples who had before them controlled the same territory.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=51}} Stephen, as Bryan Cartledge emphasizes, also gave his kingdom "forty years of relative peace and sound but unspectacular rule".{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=17}}

His successors, even those who were descended from Vazul, were eager to emphasize their devotion to Stephen's achievements.{{sfn|Lenkey|2003|p=106}} Vazul's son, [[Andrew I of Hungary]] (r. 1046<U+2013>1060), although he acquired the throne due to a [[Vata pagan uprising|pagan uprising]], prohibited pagan rites and declared that all of his subjects should "live in all things according to the law which King St. Stephen had tought them"<ref>''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 60.86), p. 113.</ref> following his coronation.{{sfn|Lenkey|2003|p=106}} In [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000<U+2013>1526)|medieval Hungary]], communities which claimed a privileged status or attempted to preserve their own "[[Privilege (law)|liberties]]" often declared that the origin of their special status was to be attributed to King Saint Stephen.{{sfn|Tringli|2001|p=129}} In a letter of 1347, for example, in their grievances against the Pannonhalma Archabbey to the king, the people of [[T<U+00E1>p]] stated that taxes levied upon them by the Abbot contradicted "the liberty granted to them in the time of King Saint Stephen".{{sfn|Tringli|2001|p=139}}

G<U+00E1>bor Klaniczay writes that Stephen's legends, suggesting that a monarch can achieve sainthood through actively using his royal powers, "opened a new chapter in the legends of holy rulers as a genre".{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=136}} Stephen was the first triumphant ''miles Christi'' ("Christ's soldier") among the canonized monarchs.{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=134}} He was also a "confessor king" whose cult was sanctioned, in contrast with earlier holy monarchs, without suffering martyrdom.{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=16}}

Stephen's intact right hand ({{lang-hu|Szent Jobb}}) became the subject of a cult after it was miraculously found when his tomb was opened in 1083.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=33}}{{sfn|Csorba|2004|p=7}} In [[Bihar County]], an abbey was dedicated to its veneration and named [[Szentjobb]] (S<U+00E2>niob, Romania) after the relic.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=33}} The relic was kept for centuries in the monastery with the exception during the Mongol invasion of 1241 and 1242, when it was transferred to [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]] (Dubrovnik, [[Croatia]]).{{sfn|Csorba|2004|p=7}} The Holy Dexter was taken to Sz<U+00E9>kesfeh<U+00E9>rv<U+00E1>r around 1420.{{sfn|Csorba|2004|p=7}} Following the [[Ottoman Hungary|occupation of the central territories of the Kingdom of Hungary by the Ottoman Turks]] in the middle of the 16th&nbsp;century, the relic was kept in many places, including [[Bosnia]], Ragusa and Vienna.<ref name='Szent_Jobb'>{{cite web |title=A Szent Jobb t<U+00F6>rt<U+00E9>nete [=History of the Holy Dexter]  |work=Szent Istv<U+00E1>n Bazilika: T<U+00F6>rt<U+00E9>net [=St. Stephen's Basilica: History] |publisher=http://www.bazilika.biz |year= 1991 |url=http://www.bazilika.biz/a-szent-jobb-tortenete/a-szent-jobb-tortenete |accessdate=2013-08-19}}</ref> It was returned to Hungary in 1771 when Queen [[Maria Theresa]] (r. 1740<U+2013>1780) donated it to the cloister of the [[Sisters of Loreto]] in Buda.<ref name='Szent_Jobb'/> The relic was kept in the St. Sigismund Chapel in the [[Buda Castle]] between around 1900 and 1944, in a cave near [[Salzburg]] in Austria in 1944 and 1945, by the Sisters of Loreto in Buda between 1945 and 1950, and in the [[St. Stephen's Basilica]] in Budapest since 1950.<ref name='Szent_Jobb'/> An annual procession has celebrated the relic since 1938, but in the period between 1950 and 1987 its celebration was forbidden by the Communist authorities.<ref name='Szent_Jobb'/>

{{Quote|Why is it, brothers, that his other limbs having become disjointed and, his flesh having been reduced to dust, wholly separated, only the right hand, its skin and [[sinews]] adhering to the bones, preserved the beauty of wholeness? I surmise that the inscrutability of divine judgement sought to proclaim by the extraordinary nature of this fact nothing less than that the work of love and alms surpasses the measure of all other virtues. ... The right hand of the blessed man was deservedly exempt from [[putrefaction]], because always reflourishing from the flower of kindness it was never empty from giving gifts to nourish the poor.|''[[Hartvik|Hartvic]], Life of King Stephen of Hungary''<ref>''Hartvic, Life of King Stephen of Hungary'' (ch. 27.), p. 396.</ref>}}

===His ''Admonitions''===
Stephen's ''Greater Legend'' writes that the king "himself compiled a book for his son on moral education".{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|pp=166-167}} This work, now known as ''Admonitions'' or ''De institutione morum'',{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=166}} was preserved in manuscripts written in the [[Late Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=343}} Although scholars debate whether it can actually be attributed to the king or rather to a cleric, most of them agree that it was composed in the first decades of the 11th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=343}}{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=167}}

The ''Admonitions'' underlines that kingship is inseparably connected with the Catholic faith.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=343}}{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=167}} Its author also emphasizes that a monarch is required to make donations to the Church and regularly consult his prelates, but he is entitled to punish clergymen who did wrong.{{sfn|Berend|Laszlovszky|Szak<U+00E1>cs|2007|p=343}} One of the basic ideas expressed in this work was that a sovereign has to cooperate with the "pillars of his rule", meaning the prelates, the aristocrats, the ''isp<U+00E1>ns'' and the warriors.{{sfn|Gy<U+00F6>rffy|1994|p=167}}

{{Quote|My dearest son, if you desire to honor the royal crown, I advise, I counsel, I urge you above all things to maintain the Catholic and Apostolic faith with such diligence and care that you may be an example for all those placed under you by God, and that all the clergy may rightly call you a man of true Christian profession. Failing to do this, you may be sure that you will not be called a Christian or a son of the Church. Indeed, in the royal palace, after the faith itself, the Church holds second place, first constituted and spread through the whole world by His members, the apostles and holy fathers, And though she always produced fresh offspring, nevertheless in certain places she is regarded as ancient. However, dearest son, even now in our kingdom the Church is proclaimed as young and newly planted; and for that reason she needs more prudent and trustworthy guardians less a benefit which the divine mercy bestowed on us undeservedly should be destroyed and annihilated through your idleness, indolence or neglect.|Stephen's ''Admonitions'' to his son, Emeric{{sfn|O'Malley|1995|pp=46-47}}}}

===Artistic representation===
King Stephen of Hungary has been a popular theme in art, especially since the 19th century, with the development of [[Romantic nationalism]]. Paintings, such as ''The Baptism of Vajk'' by [[Gyula Bencz<U+00FA>r]] from 1875), and many statues representing the king throughout Hungary and the neighboring countries testify to Stephen's importance in Hungarian national thought. [[Ferenc Erkel]]'s last complete [[opera]] from 1885, ''Istv<U+00E1>n kir<U+00E1>ly'' ("King Stephen"), was named for him.

Stephen I is also represented in a number of musical compositions.  His best known representation in music was [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''[[K<U+00F6>nig Stephan|King Stephen Overture]]''.  In 1938, Hungarian composer [[Zolt<U+00E1>n Kod<U+00E1>ly]] wrote a choral piece titled ''Hymn to King Stephen'' ({{lang-hu|<U+00C9>nek Szent Istv<U+00E1>n Kir<U+00E1>lyhoz}}).<ref name=NHQ>{{cite journal|journal=The New Hungarian Quarterly|year=1982|volume=23|page=213|publisher=Corvina Press}}</ref><ref name=Breuer>{{cite book|last=Breuer|first=J<U+00E1>nos|title=Kod<U+00E1>ly-kalauz|year=1982|publisher=Zenem<U+0171>kiad<U+00F3>|isbn=0328473596|pages=293, 318|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=E_2hUprkC4ORygHkk4DYDA&id=JzEXAQAAIAAJ&dq=%22%C3%89nek+Szent+Istv%C3%A1n+Kir%C3%A1lyhoz%22&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%22%C3%89nek+Szent+Istv%C3%A1n+Kir%C3%A1lyhoz%22+%2B+%221938%22}}</ref>  [[Levente Sz<U+00F6>r<U+00E9>nyi]] and [[J<U+00E1>nos Br<U+00F3>dy]] composed a [[rock opera]], ''[[Istv<U+00E1>n, a kir<U+00E1>ly]]'' ("Stephen, the King"), of the early years of his reign in 1983. A [[sequel]] to it, ''Veled, Uram!'' ("You, Sir!"), was composed in 2000 by Sz<U+00F6>r<U+00E9>nyi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=hu&u=http://vivalamusical.hu/kritikak/veled-uram&prev=/search%3Fq%3DVeled,%2BUram!%26biw%3D800%26bih%3D403|title=Veled, Uram!
