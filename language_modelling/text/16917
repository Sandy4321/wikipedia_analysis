'''Franz Ritter Halder''' ([[June 30]] [[1884]] &ndash; [[April 2]] [[1972]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[General]] and the head of the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|Army General Staff]] from 1938 until September 1942, when he was dismissed after frequent disagreements with [[Adolf Hitler]].

==Early life==

Halder was born in [[W<U+00FC>rzburg]] to General Max Halder.  In 1902 he joined the 3rd Royal [[Bavaria]]n Field [[Artillery]] [[Regiment]] in [[Munich]].  He was promoted to [[Lieutenant]] in 1904 upon graduation from War School in Munich, then he attended  Artillery School (1906&ndash;07) and the Bavarian Staff College (War Academy) (1911&ndash;14), both in Munich.

==World War I==
In 1914 during [[World War I]], Halder became an Ordnance Officer, serving in the Headquarters of the Bavarian 3rd Army Corps.  In August 1915 he was promoted to [[Hauptmann]] (Captain) on the General Staff of the Crown Prince of Bavaria's 6th Infantry Division.  During 1917 he served as a General Staff officer in the Headquarters of the 2nd Army, before being transferred to the 4th Army.

==Interwar era==
Between 1919 and 1920 Halder served with the [[Reichswehr]] War Ministry Training Branch. Between 1921 and 1923 he was a Tactics Instructor with the [[Glossary of the Weimar Republic|Wehrkreis]] VII in Munich.

In March 1924 Halder was promoted to [[Major]] and by 1926 he served as the Director of Operations (Oberquartiermeister of Operations: O.Qu.I.) on the General Staff of the Wehrkreis VII in Munich.  In February 1929 he was promoted to [[Oberstleutnant]] (Lieutenant Colonel), and from October 1929 through late 1931 he served on the Training staff in the Reichswehr Ministry.

After being promoted to Oberst (Colonel) in December 1931, Halder served as the Chief of Staff, Wehrkreis Kdo VI, in [[M<U+00FC>nster]] ([[Westphalia]]) through early 1934.  During the 1930s the German military staff thought that [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] might attack the detached German province of [[East Prussia]]. As such, they reviewed plans as to how to defend East Prussia.

After being promoted to [[Generalmajor]] (Major-General) in October 1934, Halder served as the Commander of the 7th Infantry Division in Munich.

Recognized as a fine staff officer and planner, in August 1936 Halder was promoted to [[Generalleutnant]] (Lieutenant-General).  He then became the director of the Manoeuvres Staff.  Shortly thereafter, he became director of the Training Branch (Oberquartiermeister of Training, O.Qu.II), on the General Staff of the Army, in [[Berlin]] between October 1937 and February 1938.  During this period he directed important training maneuvers, the largest held since the reintroduction of [[conscription]] in 1935.

On [[February 1]], [[1938]] Halder was promoted to General der Artillerie.  Around this date General [[Wilhelm Keitel]] was attempting to reorganize the entire upper leadership of the [[Heer|German Army]]. Keitel had asked Halder to become Chief of the General Staff (Oberquartiermeister of operations, training & supply; O.Qu.I ) and report to General [[Walther von Reichenau]].  However, Halder declined as he felt he could not work with Reichenau very well, due to a personality dispute.  As Keitel recognized Halder's superior military planning skills, Keitel met with Hitler and enticed him to appoint General [[Walther von Brauchitsch]] as commander-in-chief of the German Army.  Halder then accepted becoming Chief of the General Staff of the Army (Oberkommando des Heeres) on September 1, 1938, and succeeded General [[Ludwig Beck]].

A week later, Halder presented plans to Hitler on how to invade [[Czechoslovakia]] with a pincer movement by General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] and General [[Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb]].  Instead, Hitler directed that Reichenau should make the main thrust into [[Prague]].  Neither plan was necessary once [[British Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]] brokered the "[[Munich Agreement]]", by surrendering the Czech region of [[Sudetenland]] to Germany.  Just before Chamberlain capitulated to Hitler, Halder &mdash; in an attempt to avoid war &mdash; discussed with several other generals the idea of removing Hitler from power.  However, on [[September 29]] Chamberlain gave in to Hitler<U+2019>s demands, and Halder<U+2019>s plot to remove Hitler died as peace had been preserved.  Two days later, on [[October 1]], German troops entered the Sudetenland.

==World War II==

During the spring of 1939, Halder began participating in drafting the invasion plans of Poland. Halder stated that he thought Polish soldiers were stupid, and thought the war could be over within 2-3 weeks.

On [[September 1]], [[1939]] Germany [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded Poland]] and thereby started World War II.  On [[September 10]] Halder noted in his diary that he had received information from the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] Commander [[Reinhard Heydrich]] that the SS was beginning its campaign to "clean house" in Poland of [[Jew]]s and all intelligentsia.  This led to future criticism by historians that Halder knew about the [[Holocaust|killings of Jews]] much earlier than he later acknowledged during post-World War II interviews, and that he failed to object to such killings.  Halder noted in his diary his doubts "about the measures intended by Himmler".<ref>''Hitler Strikes Poland'', pp. 22, 116 and 176</ref>

During November 1939, Halder conspired with General Brauchitsch that he would support Brauchitsch if he were to try to curtail Hitler<U+2019>s plans for further expansion of the war, but Brauchitsch declined (the so-called [[Zossen Conspiracy]]).  While Halder opposed Hitler<U+2019>s expanded war plans, like all officers he had taken a personal loyalty oath to Hitler.  Thus, he was blocked from taking direct action against der F<U+00FC>hrer.

At the end of 1939, Halder oversaw development of the invasion plans of [[France]], the [[Low Countries]], and the [[Balkans]].  Halder initially doubted that Germany could successfully invade France.  General [[Erich von Manstein]]'s bold plan for invading France through the [[Ardennes|Ardennes Forest]] proved successful, and ultimately led to the capture of France.  On [[July 19]], [[1940]] Halder was promoted to [[Generaloberst]] (Colonel-General).  In August, he began working on [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion plan for the [[Soviet Union]]. Shortly thereafter, to curtail Halder<U+2019>s military-command power, Hitler limited the General's  involvement in the war by restricting him to developing battle plans for only the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].  Halder appeared on the [[June 29]], [[1942]] cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.

During the summer of 1942 Halder told Hitler that he was underestimating the number of Russian military units;  Hitler argued that the Russians were nearly broken.  Furthermore, Hitler did not like Halder<U+2019>s objections to sending General Manstein<U+2019>s 11th Army to assist in the [[Siege of Leningrad|attack against Leningrad]].  Halder also had thought that the German attack into the Caucasus was ill advised.  Finally, because of Halder<U+2019>s disagreement with Hitler<U+2019>s conduct of the war, Hitler decided that the General no longer possessed an aggressive war mentality, and therefore retired Halder into the "Fuhrer Reserve" on [[September 24]], [[1942]].

On [[July 20]], [[1944]] a group of German army officers [[July 20 Plot|attempted to assassinate Hitler]].  The following day Halder was arrested by the [[Gestapo]], although he was not involved in the assassination attempt.  As Hitler considered Halder a possible leader who could overthrow him, Halder was imprisoned at both the [[Flossenb<U+00FC>rg concentration camp|Flossenb<U+00FC>rg]] and the [[Dachau concentration camp]]s.  On [[January 31]], [[1945]] Halder was officially dismissed from the army.  He was released from prison on [[April 24]].  He surrendered to [[United States|U.S.]] troops in the [[Austria]]n [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] on [[May 4]].  Halder spent the next two years in a [[prisoner of war]] camp.

==After World War II==

During the 1950s, Halder worked as a war historian advisor to the U.S. Army Historical Division.  He died in 1972 in [[Aschau im Chiemgau]], Bavaria.

==Publications==

Halder authored ''Hitler as War Lord'' (1949) and ''The Halder Diaries'' (1976). The latter diaries were later used by [[United States|American]] historian [[William Shirer]], as a major [[primary source]] for his monumental work ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'', along with other confidential documents and manuscripts.

In reviewing Halder's personality, the British author [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] wrote:  "Halder is a military snob, believing that no amateur can ever understand the mysteries of war."  Author [[Kenneth Macksey]] wrote: "Quick, shrewd and witty, he was a brilliant specialist in operational and training matters and the son of a distinguished general.  He supported Beck's resistance to Hitler, but when it came to a crunch was no real help.  Flirt as he did, in September, with those opposed to Hitler, he toed the party line when extreme pressure was exerted for the return of the Sudetenland and its German nationals by the Czechs to Germany."
