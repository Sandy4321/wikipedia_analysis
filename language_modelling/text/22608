'''Boulder Mountain''' in [[Utah]], [[United States|USA]] makes up half of the [[Aquarius Plateau]] of South Central Utah in [[Wayne County, Utah|Wayne]] and [[Garfield County, Utah|Garfield]] counties. The mountain rises to the west of [[Capitol Reef National Park]] and consists of steep slopes and cliffs with over 50,000 acres (200&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of rolling forest and meadowlands on the top.<ref>http://www.utahoutdoors.com/pages/Boulder_Mountain_Basics.htm Boulder Mountain on Utahoutdoors.com</ref> It is the highest timbered plateau in North America and is part of the [[Dixie National Forest]].

[[Utah Scenic Byway 12]] traverses the eastern side of the mountain from [[Torrey, Utah|Torrey]] through [[Boulder, Utah|Boulder]] and on to [[Escalante, Utah|Escalante]]. A series of unpaved backcountry roads and jeep trails provide access to the top during the brief snow free time, which is usually only a few months from July to September.
