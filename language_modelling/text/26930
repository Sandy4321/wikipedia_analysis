'''''Thoughts on the education of daughters: with reflections on female conduct, in the more important duties of life''''' is British [[feminist]] [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Mary Wollstonecraft's]] first published work. Published in [[1787 in literature|1787]] by her friend, [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]], ''Thoughts'' is a [[conduct book]] that offers advice on female education to the emerging British [[middle class]]. Although dominated by considerations of morality and etiquette, the text also contains basic child-rearing instructions, such as how to care for an infant.

An early version of the modern [[self-help|self-help book]], the [[eighteenth-century]] British conduct book drew on several literary traditions, such as advice manuals and religious narratives. There was an explosion in the number of conduct books published during the second half of the eighteenth century, and Wollstonecraft published ''Thoughts'' to take advantage of this burgeoning market. However, the book was only moderately successful: it was favorably reviewed, but only by one journal and reprinted only once. Although it was excerpted in popular magazines of the time, it was not republished until the rise of [[feminist literary criticism]] in the 1970s.

Like other conduct books of the time, ''Thoughts'' adapts older genres to the new middle-class ethos. The book encourages mothers to teach their daughters analytical thinking, self-discipline, honesty, contentment in their social position, and marketable skills (in case they should ever need to support themselves). These goals reveal Wollstonecraft's intellectual debt to [[John Locke]]; however, the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his. Her aim is to educate women to be useful wives and mothers, because, she argues, it is through these roles that they can most effectively contribute to society. In attempting to outline a meaningful position for women in society, Wollstonecraft paradoxically confines them to the domestic sphere.

Although much of Wollstonecraft's text is devoted to platitudes and advice common to all conduct books for women, a few passages anticipate her feminist arguments in ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), such as her poignant description of the suffering single woman. However, several critics have suggested that such passages only seem to have radical undertones in light of Wollstonecraft's later works. 

==Biographical background==
[[Image:Governess.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of [[Rebecca Solomon|Rebecca Solomon's]] ''The Governess'' (1851)]]
Like many impoverished women during the last quarter of the eighteenth century in Britain, Wollstonecraft attempted to support herself by establishing a school; she, her sister, and a close friend founded a school in the [[English dissenters|Dissenting]] community of [[Newington Green]]. However, in the late 1780s she was forced to close it because of financial difficulties. Desperate to escape from debt, Wollstonecraft wrote her first book, ''Thoughts on the Education of Daughters'', and sold the [[copyright]] for only ten [[guineas]] to [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]], a publisher recommended to her by a friend.  Wollstonecraft and Johnson became friends and he encouraged her writing throughout her life.  Drawing on her experience as a teacher and as a companion, she offered advice to mothers through one of the most popular genres of the day<U+2014>the [[conduct book]].  

Wollstonecraft next tried her hand at being a [[governess]], but she chafed at her lowly position and refused to accommodate herself to her employers.  The modest success of ''Thoughts'' and Johnson's encouragement emboldened Wollstonecraft to embark on a career as a professional writer, a precarious and somewhat disreputable profession for women during the eighteenth century. She wrote to her sister that she was going to become the <U+201C>first of a new genus<U+201D>.<ref>Sapiro, 13; 239; Taylor, 6<U+2013>7; Jones, "Literature of advice", 120; Richardson, 24-25; Todd, 75-77.</ref>

==Overview==
The twenty-one chapters of ''Thoughts on the Education of Daughters'' explain how to educate a woman from infancy through marriage. Addressed to mothers, young women, and others involved in caring for and teaching girls, the text begins with advice on the care of a baby, arguing that a mother should [[History of breastfeeding|breastfeed]] her own child (a hotly debated topic in the eighteenth century),<ref>Todd, 257-58.</ref> and ends with a chapter delineating the appropriate "public places" for young women to frequent. Covering a wide range of topics, the book outlines proper "moral discipline"; endorses early childhood reading; describes a rational approach to love, friendship and marriage; argues for [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath observance]]; lays out a woman's household duties; and explains the appropriate sense of benevolence she should feel for those around her. Many of the chapters criticize elements of what Wollstonecraft considers the damaging education offered to women, such as "artificial manners", card-playing, theater-going and an emphasis on fashion. She complains, for example, that women "squander" their money on clothing, <U+201C>which if saved for charitable purposes, might alleviate the distress of many poor families, and soften the heart of the girl who entered into such scenes of woe.<U+201D><ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Thoughts on the Education of Daughters'' (1787), 37.</ref>

In her later works, Wollstonecraft repeatedly returned to the topics addressed in ''Thoughts'', particularly the virtue of hard work and the imperative for women to learn useful skills. Wollstonecraft suggests that the social and political life of the nation would greatly improve if women would acquire valuable skills instead of being mere social ornaments.<ref>Taylor, 32; Kelly, 29<U+2013>30; Sapiro, 13; Richardson, 26; Jones, "Literature of advice", 127.</ref>

==Genre: the conduct book==
[[Image:ChaponeLettersTitle.jpg|thumb|left|Title page from the first volume of the first edition of [[Hester Chapone|Chapone's]] ''[[Letters on the Improvement of the Mind|Letters]]'' (1773), one of the most popular [[conduct book]]s at the time Wollstonecraft was writing]]
Between 1760 and 1820, [[conduct book]]s reached the height of their popularity in Britain; one scholar refers to the period as "the age of courtesy books for women".<ref>Qtd. in Armstrong, 61.</ref> As [[Nancy Armstrong]] writes in her seminal work on this genre, ''Desire and Domestic Fiction'' (1987): "so popular did these books become that by the second half of the eighteenth century virtually everyone knew the ideal of womanhood they proposed".<ref>Armstrong, 61.</ref>

Conduct books integrated the styles and rhetorics of earlier genres, such as devotional writings, marriage manuals, recipe books, and works on household economy. They offered their readers a description of (most often) the ideal woman while at the same time handing out practical advice. Thus, not only did they dictate morality, but they also guided readers' choice of dress and outlined "proper" etiquette.<ref>Sutherland, 26.</ref> Typical examples include [[Blue Stockings Society (England)|Bluestocking]] [[Hester Chapone|Hester Chapone's]] ''[[Letters on the Improvement of the Mind]]'' (1773), which went through at least sixteen editions in the last quarter of the eighteenth century, and the classically-educated historian [[Catharine Macaulay|Catharine Macaulay's]] ''Letters on Education'' (1790).<ref>Sutherland, 28; 35.</ref> Chapone's work, in particular, appealed to Wollstonecraft at this time and influenced her composition of ''Thoughts'' because it argued "for a sustained programme of study for women" and was based on the idea that Christianity should be "the chief instructor of our rational faculties".<ref>Sutherland, 29.</ref> Moreover, it emphasized that women should be considered rational beings and not left to wallow in sensualism.<ref>Sutherland, 41.</ref> When Wollstonecraft wrote ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' in 1792, she drew on both Chapone and Macaulay's works.<ref>Sutherland, 42<U+2013>43.</ref>

Conduct books have traditionally been viewed by scholars as an integral factor in the creation of a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] sense of self.<ref>Jones, "Literature of advice", 121; see Mary Poovey's ''The Proper Lady and the Woman Writer'' and Nancy Armstrong's ''Desire and Domestic Fiction'' for discussions of the conduct book.</ref> The conduct book <U+201C>helped to generate the belief that there was such a thing as a 'middle class' and that the modest, submissive but morally and domestically competent woman it described was the first 'modern individual'<U+201D>.<ref>Jones, "Literature of advice", 121.</ref> By developing a specifically bourgeois ethos through genres such as the conduct book, the emerging middle class challenged the primacy of the aristocratic code of manners.<ref name=Kelly31>Kelly, 31.</ref> However, conduct books simultaneously constricted women's roles, propagating what has been called "the angel in the house" image (alluding to [[Coventry Patmore|Coventry Patmore's]] [[The Angel in the House|poem of that name]]); women were encouraged to be chaste, pious, submissive, modest, selfless, graceful, pure, delicate, compliant, reticent, and polite.<ref>[[Susan Gubar|Gubar, Susan]] and [[Sandra Gilbert]]. ''[[The Madwoman in the Attic|The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination]]''. New Haven: Yale University Press (1984), 23.</ref> 

More recently, a few scholars have argued that conduct books should be differentiated more carefully and that some of them <U+2014> such as Wollstonecraft's ''Thoughts'' <U+2014> transformed traditional female advice manuals into "proto-feminist tracts".<ref name=Jones122>Jones, "Literature of advice", 122.</ref> These scholars view ''Thoughts'' as part of a tradition that adapted older genres to a new message of female empowerment, genres such as advice manuals for women's education, moral and spiritual works by religious [[English dissenters|Dissenters]] (those not associated with the [[Church of England]]), and moral satires.<ref>Jones, "Literature of advice", 122<U+2013>23.</ref> Wollstonecraft's text resembles conventional conduct books in promoting traits of self-control and submission that would attract a husband. Yet at the same time, the text challenges this portrait of the <U+201C>proper lady<U+201D> by introducing strains of religious Dissent that promote equality of the soul. Thus, ''Thoughts'' appears to be torn between several sets of binaries, such as compliance and rebellion; spiritual meekness and rational independence; and domestic duty and political participation. This view of the conduct book, and of ''Thoughts'' in particular, questions the earlier interpretation of the genre as a mere tool of ideological indoctrination, an interpretation that had grown out of criticism influenced by theorists such as [[Michel Foucault]].<ref>Jones, "Literature of advice", 128<U+2013>29; see also Poovey, 55 and Jones, "Literature of advice", 126.</ref>

==Pedagogical theory==
[[Image:JohnLocke.png|thumb|right|[[John Locke]], author of ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' (1693)]]
By the end of her life, Wollstonecraft had been involved in almost every arena of education: she had been a governess, a teacher, a children's writer, and a pedagogical theorist. Most of her works deal with education in some way. For example, her two novels are ''[[bildungsroman]]e'' (novels of education); she translated educational works such as [[Christian Gotthilf Salzmann|Christian Gotthilf Salzmann's]] ''Elements of Morality''; and her ''Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' is largely an argument for the value of female education. As is evidenced by this broad range of genres, <U+201C>education<U+201D> for Wollstonecraft and her contemporaries included much more than scholastic training; it encompassed everything that went into forming a person's character, from infant [[swaddling]] to childhood curricular choices to adolescent leisure activities.<ref>Sapiro, 13; 239; Richardson, 24.</ref>

Wollstonecraft and other [[Radicalism (historical)#United Kingdom|political radicals]] during the last quarter of the eighteenth century focused their reform efforts on education because they believed that if people were educated correctly, Britain would experience a moral and political revolution. Religious [[English dissenters|Dissenters]], especially, embraced this view; and Wollstonecraft's philosophy in ''Thoughts'' and elsewhere closely resembles that of the Dissenters she met while teaching in [[Newington Green]], such as the theologian, educator and scientist [[Joseph Priestley]] and the minister [[Richard Price]]. Dissenters <U+201C>were most concerned with molding children into people of good moral character and habits<U+201D>.<ref>Sapiro, 239.</ref> However, political conservatives, who also believed that childhood was the crucial time for the formation of a person's character, used their own educational works to deflect rebellion by promoting theories of compliance. Liberals and conservatives alike subscribed to [[John Locke|Lockean]] and [[David Hartley (philosopher)|Hartleian]] [[Association of Ideas|associationist psychology]]: that is, they believed that a person's sense of self was built up through a set of associations made between things in the external world and ideas in the mind. Both Locke and Hartley had argued that the associations formed in childhood were nearly irreversible and must thus be formed with care.<ref>Richardson, 24<U+2013>25; Sapiro, 239.</ref> Locke famously advised parents to keep their children away from servants, as they would only tell children frightening stories that would foster a fear of the dark.<ref>Locke, John. ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. Ed. Roger Woolhouse. New York: Penguin Books (1997), 357.</ref>

Wollstonecraft was significantly influenced by Locke's ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' (1693) (her title alludes to it) and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau's]] ''[[Emile: or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762), the two most important pedagogical treatises of the eighteenth century. ''Thoughts'' follows in the Lockean tradition with its emphasis on a parent-directed domestic education, a distrust of servants, a banning of superstitious and irrational stories (e.g. [[fairy tale]]s), and an advocacy of clear rules. Wollstonecraft breaks from Locke, however, in her emphasis on piety and her insistence that the child has <U+201C>innate<U+201D> feelings that guide her towards virtue, ideas likely drawn from Rousseau.<ref>Sapiro, 13; 239<U+2013>40; Richardson 24<U+2013>27; Jones, "Literature of advice", 125.</ref>

==Themes==
''Thoughts'' advocates several educational goals for women: independent thought, rationality, self-discipline, truthfulness, acceptance of one's social position, marketable skills and faith in God.<ref>Sapiro, 104; 240; Taylor, 32; Richardson, 26; Kelly, 29<U+2013>31.</ref>

[[Image:Joseph Highmore 001.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Joseph Highmore|Joseph Highmore's]] illustration of [[Pamela (novel)|Pamela]] teaching her children (1743<U+2013>45); in volume four of the novel, Pamela endorses much of Locke's educational program, while at the same time claiming a valuable new role for mothers: educator.]]
===Education of women===
Wollstonecraft assumes that the <U+201C>daughters<U+201D> in her book will one day become mothers and teachers. She does not propose that women abandon these traditional roles, because she believes that women can most effectively improve society as pedagogues.<ref name=EduWomen>Richardson, 25<U+2013>27; Jones, "Literature of advice", 124.</ref> Wollstonecraft and other writers, as diverse as the [[evangelical]] moralist [[Hannah More]], the historian [[Catherine Macaulay]] and the feminist novelist [[Mary Hays]], argue that since women are the primary caregivers of the family and educators of children, they should be given a sound education.<ref name=EduWomen/> ''Thoughts'' is insistent, following Locke and associationist psychology, that a poor education and an early marriage will ruin a woman.<ref name=EduWomen/> Wollstonecraft argues that if no attention is paid to girls as they are growing, they will turn out poorly and marry while still intellectual and emotional children. Such wives, she contends, perform no useful role in society and, indeed, contribute to its immorality.<ref name=EduWomen/> She would expand upon this argument five years later in ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''.<ref name=EduWomen/>

Wollstonecraft and others decried the education traditionally advocated for women, which they saw as decadent and "accomplishment"-based.<ref>Taylor, 34; Richardson, 25.</ref> The ideal woman in ''Thoughts'' is, as Wollstonecraft scholar Gary Kelly writes, <U+201C>rational, provident, realistic, self-disciplined, self-conscious and critical", an image that resembles that of the professional man.<ref>Kelly, 30.</ref> However, by envisioning a masculine role for women, one that they could not perform in the public sphere, Wollstonecraft leaves women without a specific position within society; the picture Wollstonecraft drew of the role for women was ultimately confining and limiting.<ref name=Kelly31/><!-- This paragraph is a little confusing.  Does "accomplishment" refer to ornamental accomplishments, such as drawing or music?  It would also be nice to understand better how Wollstonecraft's roles were confining and limiting. -->

Wollstonecraft's most passionate writing in ''Thoughts'' focuses on the lack of career opportunities for women, a theme that would dominate her later novel ''[[Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman]]'' (1798).<ref>Richardson, 27.</ref> In the chapter entitled "Unfortunate Situation of Females, Fashionably Educated, and Left without a Fortune" she writes, perhaps describing her own experiences:
<blockquote>
Perhaps to be an humble companion to some rich old cousin&nbsp;<U+2026> It is impossible to enumerate the many hours of anguish such a person must spend. Above the servants, yet considered by them as a spy, and ever reminded of her inferiority when in conversation with the superiors.&nbsp;<U+2026> A teacher at a school is only a kind of upper servant, who has more work than the menial ones. A governess to young ladies is equally disagreeable.&nbsp;<U+2026> life glides away, and the spirits with it; 'and when youth and genial years are flown,' they have nothing to subsist on; or, perhaps, on some extraordinary occasion, some small allowance may be made for them, which is thought a great charity.&nbsp;<U+2026> It is hard for a person who has a relish for polished society, to herd with the vulgar, or to condescend to mix with her formal equals when she is considered in a different light.&nbsp;<U+2026> How cutting is the contempt she meets with!<U+2014>A young mind looks round for love and friendship; but love and friendship fly from poverty: expect them not if you are poor!<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Thoughts'' (1787), 69<U+2013>74.</ref>
</blockquote>

===Religion===
Although Wollstonecraft's comments on female education hint at some of her more radical arguments in ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'', the religious tone of the text <U+2014> also found in her first novel, ''[[Mary: A Fiction]]'' (1788) <U+2014> is generally viewed by scholars as conservative.<ref name=Jones1245>Jones, "Literature of advice", 124-25.</ref> The religion presented in ''Thoughts'' is one that celebrates the <U+201C>pleasures of resignation<U+201D>, the belief that the afterlife is awaiting and that the world is ordered by God for the best.<ref name=Jones1245/> She writes:
<blockquote>
He who is training us up for immortal bliss, knows best what trials will contribute to make us [virtuous]; and our resignation and improvement will render us respectable to ourselves, and to that Being, whose approbation is of more value than life itself.<ref>Wollstonecraft, ''Thoughts on the Education of Daughters'' (1787), 78.</ref>
</blockquote>
Although Wollstonecraft drifted away from these beliefs and later adopted a more permissive theology, ''Thoughts'' is <U+201C>steeped in orthodox attitudes, advocating 'fixed principles of religion' and warning of the dangers of rationalist speculation and deism.<U+201D><ref name="Taylor95">Taylor, 95.</ref> Wollstonecraft even agrees with [[Rousseau]] that women should be taught religious dogma rather than theology; clear rules, she maintains, will restrain their passions.<ref name="Taylor95" />

==Reception==
[[Image:MaryWollstonecraft.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] by [[John Opie]] (c. 1790<U+2013>91)]]
''Thoughts''  was only moderately successful: it was reprinted in [[Dublin]] a year after its initial publication in London, extracts were published in ''[[The Lady's Magazine]]'', and Wollstonecraft included excerpts from it in her own ''Female Reader'' (1789), an anthology of writings designed <U+201C>for the Improvement of Young Women<U+201D>. ''[[The English Review]]'' noticed ''Thoughts'' favorably:
<blockquote>
These thoughts are employed on various important situations and incidents in the ordinary life of females, and are, in general, dictated with great judgment. Mrs. Wollstonecraft appears to have reflected maturely on her subject;&nbsp;<U+2026> while her manner gives authority, her good sense adds irresistible weight to almost all her precepts and remarks. We should therefore recommend these Thoughts as worthy the attention of those who are more immediately concerned in the education of young ladies.<ref>Qtd. in Jones, "Literature of advice", 129.</ref>
</blockquote>
However, no other journal reviewed the book and ''Thoughts'' was not reprinted until the late twentieth century, when there was a resurgence of interest in Wollstonecraft among [[feminist literary criticism|feminist literary critics]].<ref>Sapiro, 13; 20; Jones, "Literature of advice", 129; Wardle, 52<U+2013>53.</ref>

Alan Richardson, a scholar of eighteenth-century education, points out that if Wollstonecraft had not written ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'' (1790) and ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'', it is unlikely that ''Thoughts'' would have been considered progressive or even worthy of notice.<ref>Richardson, 26.</ref> One critic has even said that the text reads as if it were simply trying to please the public.<ref>Kelly, 34; Richardson, 26.</ref> Although some scholars have argued that there are glimmers of Wollstonecraft's radicalism in this text, they admit that the <U+201C>potential for critique remains largely latent<U+201D>.<ref>Jones, "Literature of advice", 124.</ref> ''Thoughts'' is therefore usually interpreted either [[teleology|teleologically]], as a first step towards the more radical ''Rights of Woman'', or dismissed as a <U+201C>politically na<U+00EF>ve potboiler<U+201D> written prior to her conversion to radicalism when she was writing the ''Rights of Men''.<ref name=Jones122/>
