The '''''Forgotten Realms''''' is a [[campaign setting]] for the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' (''D&D'') [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]]. Commonly referred to by players and game designers alike as "The Realms", it was  created by game designer [[Ed Greenwood]] around 1967 as a setting for his childhood stories.<ref name="FRGB">{{cite book|last=Fannon|first=Sean Patrick|title=The Fantasy Roleplaying Gamer's Bible|edition=2nd|year=1999|isbn=0-9674429-0-7}}</ref> Several years later, Greenwood brought the setting to the ''D&D'' game as a series of magazine articles, and the first Realms game products were released in 1987. Role-playing game products have been produced for the setting ever since, as have various licensed products including [[sword and sorcery]] [[List of Forgotten Realms novels|novels]], [[computer role-playing game]] adaptations (including the first [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] to use graphics), and comic books. The Forgotten Realms is one of the most popular ''D&D'' settings,<ref>{{cite news | first=Matt | last=Slagle | title='Neverwinter Nights' sequel brings more dungeon exploration to PC | date=2007-01-18 | publisher=[[Deseret News]] | url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20070118/ai_n17153575 | work =[[Associated Press]] | accessdate = 2008-12-04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Desslock | title='Neverwinter Nights' sequel brings more dungeon exploration to PC | date=1999-01-20 | url =http://reviews.cnet.com/pc-games/baldur-s-gate-pc/4505-9696_7-30975286.html | work =[[CNET Networks]] | accessdate = 2008-12-04 }}</ref>  largely due to the success of novels by authors such as [[R. A. Salvatore]] and numerous computer role-playing games, including ''[[Pool of Radiance]]'' (1988), ''[[Baldur's Gate series|Baldur's Gate]]'' (1998), ''[[Icewind Dale]]'' (2000) and ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' (2002).

According to the setting's creators, the "Forgotten Realms" is the name of an imaginary [[Fictional universe|fantasy world]] that exists somewhere beyond the real world. The setting is described as a world of strange lands, dangerous creatures, and mighty deities, where magic and seemingly supernatural phenomena are quite real. The premise is that, long ago, the Earth and the world of the Forgotten Realms were more closely connected. As time passed, the inhabitants of planet Earth have mostly forgotten about the existence of that other world&mdash;hence the term "Forgotten Realms". On the original Forgotten Realms logo, which was used until 2000, small [[Runic alphabet|runic letters]] read "Herein lie the lost lands", an allusion to the connection between the two worlds.

==The world==
The focus of the Forgotten Realms setting is the [[continent]] of [[Faer<U+00FB>n]], part of the fictional world of [[Abeir-Toril]] (usually called simply Toril), an [[Earth]]-like planet with many real-world influences. Unlike Earth, the lands of the Forgotten Realms are not all ruled by the human race: the planet [[Abeir-Toril]] is shared by [[Human (Dungeons & Dragons)|humans]], [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarves]], [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]], [[Goblin (Dungeons & Dragons)|goblins]], [[Orc (Dungeons & Dragons)|orcs]], and other  peoples and creatures. Technologically, the world of the Forgotten Realms is not nearly as advanced as that of Earth; in this respect, it resembles the pre-industrial Earth of the 13th or 14th century.{{Fact|date=June 2010}} However, the presence of magic provides an additional element of power to the societies. There are several nation states and many independent cities, with loose alliances being formed for defense or conquest. Trade is performed by ship or [[horse-drawn vehicle]], and manufacturing is based upon cottage industry.  
<!--This para is commented out because it is not written in an encyclopedic style and seems to be copied from somewhere - In spite of the Realms' connection with Earth, the world of the Forgotten Realms is in many ways not like the real world. On the planet Abeir-Toril, the dead sometimes choose to walk among the living, gods meddle with mortal matters, a desert seems to have a mind of its own, dragons are always a very real threat, and no tale can be too strange to be true. Many wondrous kingdoms and events of the past have been long forgotten, and with every passing year new mysteries arise.-->

===Geography===
[[File:Faerun political.png|thumb|300px|A map of [[Faer<U+00FB>n]]]]
{{main|Abeir-Toril}}
Abeir-Toril consists of several large continents, including [[Faer<U+00FB>n]], the western part of a continent that was roughly modeled after the Eurasian continent on Earth.<ref name=mackay2001/> Faer<U+00FB>n was first detailed in the original ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set]]'', published in 1987 by [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]].<ref name="FRCS1st"/> The other continents include [[Kara-Tur]], [[Zakhara]], [[Maztica]], and other yet unspecified landmasses. Kara-Tur, roughly corresponding to ancient East [[Asia]], was later the focus of its own source book ''Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms'', published in 1988.<ref>{{cite book| last=Pondsmith| first=Mike| authorlink=Mike Pondsmith| coauthors=Jay Batista, Rick Swan| year=1988| title=Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms| publisher=[[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]| isbn=0-88038-608-8}}</ref>

Various products detailing specific areas of Faer<U+00FB>n, such as the 2nd edition ''[[Anauroch (accessory)|FR13 Anauroch]]'' (1991), ''FR15 Gold and Glory'' (1992), ''[[The Shining South|FR16 The Shining South]]'' (1993), and ''[[The Dalelands|FRS1 The Dalelands]]'' (1993), have been released, and through these much of the continent has been heavily detailed and documented to create a highly developed setting.

In early editions of the setting, ''The Realms'' shared a unified [[cosmology]] with various other [[campaign setting]]s called the Great Wheel. In this way each of the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' campaign settings were linked together to form one interwoven world connected by various [[Plane (Dungeons & Dragons)|planes]] of existence. With the release of the 2001 ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'', the setting was given its own distinct and separate cosmological arrangement, with unique planes not explicitly connected to those of the other settings.<ref name="FRCS3rd">{{cite book | last=Greenwood | first=Ed | coauthors= Sean K Reynolds, Skip Williams, Rob Heinsoo | year=2001 | title=Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting | publisher=Wizards of the Coast | isbn=0-7869-1836-5}}</ref><ref name="Player's Guide 2004">{{cite book | last=Baker | first=Richard | coauthors= James Wyatt | year=2004 | title=Player's Guide To Faer<U+00FB>n| publisher=Wizards of the Coast | isbn=0-7869-3134-5}}</ref>

===Religion===
{{main|List of Forgotten Realms deities}}
Religion plays a large part in the ''Forgotten Realms'', with deities and their followers being an integral part of the world. They do not have a passive role, but in fact interact directly in mortal affairs, answer prayers, and have their own personal agendas. All deities must have worshipers to survive, and all mortals must worship a patron deity to secure a good afterlife. A huge number of diverse deities exist within several [[polytheism|polytheistic]] pantheons; a large number of supplements have documented many of them, some in more detail than others.<ref>{{cite book| last=Boyd| first=Eric L.| year=1998| title=Demihuman Deities| publisher=[[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]| isbn=0-7869-1239-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Boyd| first=Eric L.| coauthors=[[Erik Mona|Mona, Erik]]| year=2002| title=Faiths and Pantheons| publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]| isbn=0-7869-2759-3}}</ref>

Much of the history of ''The Realms'' detailed in novels and source books  concerns the actions of various deities or ''The Chosen'' (mortal representatives with a portion of their deities' power) such as [[Elminster]], [[Fzoul Chembryl]], Midnight (who later became the new embodiment of the goddess of magic, [[Mystra (goddess)|Mystra]]), and the [[Seven Sisters (Forgotten Realms)|Seven Sisters]]. Above all other deities is [[Lord Ao|Ao]], the Overlord. Ao does not sanction worshipers and distances himself from mortals. He is single-handedly responsible for the [[Time of Troubles (Forgotten Realms)|Time of Troubles]], or Godswar, as seen in ''[[The Avatar Trilogy]]''.{{Fact|date=June 2010}}

===Characters===
{{main|List of Forgotten Realms characters}}
The setting is the home of several iconic characters popularized by authors, including [[Elminster Aumar|Elminster]] the wizard, who has appeared in several series of novels created by Greenwood himself, and [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] the highly popular [[Drow (Dungeons & Dragons)|drow]], or dark elf, ranger created by [[R. A. Salvatore]].

==History==
[[File:Ed Greenwood.jpg|thumb|left|Ed Greenwood in 2008]]
===Early years===
Ed Greenwood began writing stories about the Forgotten Realms as a child, starting around 1967;<ref name="30 Years" /> they were his "dream space for swords and sorcery stories".<ref name="30 Years" /> Greenwood came up with the "Forgotten Realms" name from the notion of a "multiverse" of parallel worlds; our Earth is one such world, and the Realms another. In Greenwood's original conception, the fantastic legends of our world derive from a fantasy world that we've now lost the way to.<ref name="Dragon #244">{{cite journal| last = Varney| first = Allen| authorlink = Allen Varney| title = ProFiles: Ed Greenwood| journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #244| page = 112| publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]]| location = [[Renton, Washington]]| month = February | year = 1998}}</ref> Greenwood discovered the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' game in 1975, and really got into role-playing with the first ''AD&D'' game releases in 1978.<ref name="Dragon #244"/> The setting became the home of Greenwood's own [[fictional universe|personal campaign]].<ref name="FRA">[[Jeff Grubb|Grubb, Jeff]]; [[Ed Greenwood|Greenwood, Ed]]. ''[[Forgotten Realms Adventures]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1990)</ref> Greenwood began a Realms campaign in the city of [[Waterdeep (city)|Waterdeep]], then started another group known as the Knights of Myth Drannor in [[Shadowdale (Forgotten Realms)|Shadowdale]]. Greenwood felt that his players' thirst for detail made the Realms what it is: "They want it to seem real, and work on <U+2018>honest jobs<U+2019> and personal activities, until the whole thing grows into far more than a casual campaign.  Roleplaying always governs over rules, and the adventures seem to develop themselves."<ref name="Dragon #244"/>

Beginning with the periodical's 30th issue in 1979,<ref name="30 Years"/><ref name="Dragon #244"/> Greenwood  published a series of short articles that detailed the setting in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]''<!--It was called The Dragon at that time, even though it is now called Dragon.--> magazine, the first of which was about a monster known as the curst.<ref name="30 Years">[[Steve Winter|Winter, Steve]]; [[Ed Greenwood|Greenwood, Ed]]; [[Jeff Grubb|Grubb, Jeff]]. ''[[30 Years of Adventure: A Celebration of Dungeons & Dragons]]'', pages 74-87. ([[Wizards of the Coast]], [[2004]]).</ref> Greenwood wrote voluminous entries to ''Dragon'' magazine, using the Realms as a setting for his descriptions of [[Magic item (Dungeons & Dragons)|magic items]], monsters, and [[Magic of Dungeons & Dragons|spells]].<ref name="FRA"/> In 1986, the American game publishing company [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] began looking for a new [[campaign setting]] for the ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' game,<ref name="30 Years"/> and assigned [[Jeff Grubb]] to find out more about the setting used by Greenwood as portrayed in his articles in ''Dragon''.<ref name="FRA"/> According to Greenwood, Grubb asked him "Do you just make this stuff up as you go, or do you really have a huge campaign world?"; he answered "yes" to both questions.<ref name="Dragon #244"/> TSR felt that the Forgotten Realms would be a more open-ended setting than the epic [[Dragonlance]] setting, and chose the Realms as a ready-made campaign setting upon deciding to publish ''AD&D'' 2nd Edition.<ref name="Dragon #244"/> Greenwood agreed to work on the project, and began working to get the Forgotten Realms officially published.<ref name="30 Years"/> Greenwood sent TSR a few dozen cardboard boxes stuffed with pencil notes and maps, and sold all rights to the Realms for a token fee.<ref name="Dragon #244"/> Greenwood noted that TSR altered his original conception of the Realms being a place that we could travel to from our world, "Concerns over possible lawsuits (kids getting hurt while trying to 'find a gate') led TSR to de-emphasize this meaning".<ref name="Dragon #244"/>

===Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st edition===
Although the Realms were yet to be an official campaign world, the module ''[[Bloodstone Pass|H1: Bloodstone Pass]]'', released in 1985 by TSR, is now considered to be a part of the Forgotten Realms,<ref>[http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showbook&bookid=2040 Bloodstone Pass] at the Pen & Paper RPG Database, listing the module as part of the Forgotten Realms game line.

Several supplements to the original boxed set were released under the first edition rules, including FR1 ''[[Waterdeep and the North]]'' and FR2 ''[[Moonshae]]'' in 1987, and FR3 ''[[Empires of the Sands]]'', FR4 ''[[The Magister]]'', FR5 ''[[The Savage Frontier]]'', FR6 ''Dreams of the Red Wizards'', and REF5 ''[[Lords of Darkness#Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st edition|Lords of Darkness]]'' in 1988. Also in 1988 came the ''City System'' boxed set, containing several maps of the city of [[Waterdeep (city)|Waterdeep]]. ''[[Ruins of Adventure]]'', a module based on the computer game ''[[Pool of Radiance]]'', was released in 1988.

The boxed set ''Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms'' was released in 1988, giving details of the lands of [[Kara-Tur]] which had previously appeared in the 1986 book ''[[Oriental Adventures#Advanced Dungeons & Dragons|Oriental Adventures]]'', and were now officially placed in the Forgotten Realms world. In 1988 also, the module ''OA5: Mad Monkey vs the Dragon Claw'' was  released  for the Kara-Tur setting as a Forgotten Realms product.

In 1989, [[DC Comics]] began publishing a series of [[Forgotten Realms (comic)|Forgotten Realms comics]] written by [[Jeff Grubb]]. Each issue contained twenty-six pages, illustrated primarily by [[Rags Morales]] and Dave Simons. Twenty-five issues were published in total, with the last being released in 1991. A fifty-six page [[Annual publication|annual]] ''Forgotten Realms Comic Annual #1: Waterdhavian Nights'', illustrated by various artists, was  released in 1990.

===Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition===
An eponymous module, based on the computer role-playing game ''[[Curse of the Azure Bonds]]'', was released in 1989, as was the ''[[The Avatar Series|The Avatar Trilogy]]'' series of novels, consisting of ''Shadowdale'', ''Tantras'', and ''Waterdeep'' that detailed the storyline which became known as the "[[Time of Troubles (Forgotten Realms)|Time of Troubles]]". A series of module adaptations for these novels were released in the same year, along with the ''[[Hall of Heroes (Forgotten Realms)|Hall of Heroes]]'' accessory, detailing many of the major characters appearing in ''Forgotten Realms'' novels published up through that time. In early 1990, the hardcover ''[[Forgotten Realms Adventures]]'' by [[Jeff Grubb]] and [[Ed Greenwood]] was released, which introduced the Realms setting to the second edition of the ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' game and detailed how the Time of Troubles had changed the setting.<ref name="FRA"/> The [[RPGA]] used the Forgotten Realms city of [[Ravens Bluff]] as the setting for their first [[Living campaigns|living campaign]]. Official RPGA support for this product line included the ''Living City'' [[adventure (Dungeons & Dragons)|modules]] series. A number of sub-settings of the Forgotten Realms were briefly supported in the early 1990's. Three more modules were produced for the [[Kara-Tur]] setting. ''The Horde: Barbarian Campaign Setting'', released in 1990, detailed [[The Hordelands]], which also featured a series of three modules. The ''Maztica Campaign Set'', in 1991, detailed the continent of [[Maztica]].

The original gray boxed set received a revision in 1993 to update it to the second edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D)'' rules system, with the release of a new ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting#2nd edition|Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting]]'' boxed set, containing three books (''A Grand Tour of the Realms'', ''Running the Realms'', and ''Shadowdale'') and various "monster supplements,"<ref name="FRCS2">{{cite book| last=Greenwood| first=Ed| authorlink=Ed Greenwood| coauthors= Jeff Grubb, Don Bingle| year=1993| title=Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting| publisher=[[TSR, Inc.]]| isbn=1-56076-617-4}}</ref> with a new graphic look.<ref name="history"/> Additional material for the setting was released steadily throughout the 1990s. Forgotten Realms novels, such as the ''[[Legacy of the Drow]]'' series, the first three books of ''[[The Elminster Series]]'', and numerous [[anthologies]], were also released throughout the 1990s, which lead to the setting being hailed as one of the most successful [[shared universe|shared fantasy universes]] of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite book| last=Oxoby| first=Marc| year=2003| title=The 1990s| publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]| isbn=9780313316159}}</ref> These novels in turn sparked interest in role-playing activity by new gamers.<ref>{{cite journal

==Reception==
In his book, ''The Fantasy Roleplaying Gamer's Bible'', Sean Patrick Fannon describes the Forgotten Realms as being "the most ambitious fantasy game setting published since [[Tekumel]]",<ref name="FRGB" /> and that it "may be the most widely played-in game setting in RPG history."<ref name="FRGB" /> Similarly, in literature, the novels written in the Forgotten Realms setting have formed one of "the industry's leading fantasy series."<ref name="Milliot2007">{{cite journal | last = Milliot | first = Jim | date = October 22, 2007 | title = Wizards Brews New Fiction Line | journal = [[Publishers Weekly]] | volume = 254 | issue = 42  }}</ref> Over time these novels have gained "unprecedented popularity,"<ref name="Oxoby2003">{{cite book | last = Oxoby | first = Marc  | year = 2003 | title = The 1990s | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | isbn = 0313316155 | page = 148 }}</ref> which led, as Marc Oxoby noted in his book, ''The 1990s'', to the novels having an "extraordinary shelf life," remaining in print for many years.<ref name="Oxoby2003" /> This popular reception has also been reflected in public libraries&mdash;for example, Joyce Saricks states in ''The Readers' Advisory Guide to Genre Fiction'' that the novels have been among the most requested books by fans of the fantasy genre.<ref name="Saricks2001">{{cite book | last = Saricks | first = Joyce G.  | year = 2001 | title = The Readers' Advisory Guide to Genre Fiction | publisher = ALA Editions | isbn = 0838908039 | pages = 49<U+2013>50 }}</ref>
