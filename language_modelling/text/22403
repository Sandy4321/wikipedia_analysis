'''''Galaxy Angel''''' is a [[bish<U+014D>jo]] [[science fiction|sci-fi]]/[[comedy]] [[anime]], [[manga]] and [[dating sim]] series by [[BROCCOLI (company)|BROCCOLI]]. It was created in July 2000, when Broccoli launched the multi-platformed project called ''Project G.A.''

The anime recently finished its fourth season, while the first season and part of the second season are available on [[DVD]] in the [[United States]]. Each broadcast is made up of two fifteen minute [[episode]]s -- much like most American cartoons -- whose titles always contain references to [[food]]. The video games are part [[strategy game]], part dating sim, and are available for the [[personal computer|PC]] and [[PlayStation 2|PS2]]. The three games in the series are titled ''Galaxy Angel'', ''Moonlit Lovers'' and ''Eternal Lovers''. All versions of the story are centered around the Angel Troupe, five or six female special agents with spacecraft.

Broccoli have announced that the video game trilogy will be released in North America, with a projected release date Summer 2006, though Broccoli will not be working on the actual game themselves. All that is currently known is that the games will be subtitled only (without an English dubbed cast). The game is planned to be a PC only release.

A sequel to the game trilogy is also in the works, entitled "''[[Galaxy Angel II ~Zettai Ryouiki no Tobira~]]''", and stars an entirely new cast that includes [[Apricot Sakuraba]], a member of "Lune Angel Troupe" and the younger sister of [[Milfeulle Sakuraba]].

The success of the video game and anime series influenced the creation of a manga series based off the video game universe. Volumes 1-5 have already been released domestically in North America by Broccoli-Books, with the second series, "Galaxy Angel Beta", released on [[2 November]] [[2005]].

In Japan, the series became so popular that a musical based on the series was made. Entitled "GALAXY ANGEL ~The Musical~", it debuted in December 2005, and featured cast members who also worked on Galaxy Angel II.

==Storyline==
'''In the anime'''

The story is about a group of women and girls who go on [[government]]-sponsored [[humanitarian]] missions as the ''Angel Troupe'' (Angel-tai) to search for ''Lost Technology'', generally a [[plot device]] to set up amusing and absurd humor typical of the show, rife with obscure Japanese puns. Many of the devices look like extremely mundane objects like sticks or rice cookers, but have fantastic powers like mutating organisms or as destructive weapons.

The Galaxy Angel anime generally abandoned any sense of strict [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] or plot arcs after the first season, so they can be viewed in any order. The cast is frequently abandoned, killed, or transmogrified only to return completely normal in the next episode. However, the fourth season introduced a new character (see below) and occasional references are made to funny events in previous seasons. Many episodes also parody aspects of Japanese culture, movies, and of course, anime, often compressing what would be expected to be multiple-episode long stories into a few minutes. Each season also contains one episode which is played straight - as a serious, non-parody episode.

The animated series can also be cited as a ''[[fanservice]] series'' in the most basic (but non-sexual) sense: the show is self-promotional, with absurd humor, spontaneous musical numbers, and elaborate costumes.

'''In the games'''

In the video game [[fictional universe|universe]], the Galaxy Angels are the guardians of the White Moon, the sacred planet of the Transbaal Empire, and the personal protectors of the White Moon Goddess Shatyarn. The story begins with Prince Eonia attempting a take over of the Transbaal Empire with the aid of the mysterious Black Moon, counterpart to the White Moon. To counter Prince Eonia, the Angel-tai along with their flagship the Elsior are placed in the hands of the kind and ever-capable Commander Takuto Meyers. In addition to the storyline differences, the personalities of the characters were also altered significantly for the anime, and the video games offer a much more in-depth look into the Galaxy Angel universe. Due to this, many fans treat the video games as the actual canonical universe for Galaxy Angel.

The second game in the trilogy, '''Moonlit Lovers''', revolves around the battles with remnants of Eonia's forces led by General Rezum and later a mysterious woman named Nephilia who claimed to be a member of a race called the Val-Fasc. A new member of the Angel-tai, Karasuma Chitose, is also introduced. The relationship between Takuto and whichever Angel whose heart he won is explored as well.

In the final game, '''Eternal Lovers''', the war with the Val-Fasc begins in earnest while a couple of refugees from the legendary EDEN (the place origin of both the White Moon and Black Moon) arrive to beg the Transbaal Empire (and the legendary hero Takuto Meyers) for help. Takuto and his Angel's relationship is also put into serious jeopardy as his duties preparing for the war with the Val-Fasc keep them apart with increasing frequency.

'''''Milfeulle Sakuraba (<U+30DF><U+30EB><U+30D5><U+30A3><U+30FC><U+30E6> <U+685C><U+8449>)'''''

[[Image:Milfeulle s.gif|left]]

:''Main article: [[Milfeulle Sakuraba]]''
'''In the anime'''
A seventeen-year-old, selfless pink-haired girl who has an incredible amount of good [[luck]] with extremely bad luck periodically to counter it. The bad luck can cause disastrous outcomes like destroying a whole planet or even an entire galaxy. Strangely enough, this could be minimized if Milfeulle is happy at those days. She can be stubborn if she doesn't get her way, but is usually happy-go-lucky. The newest member of the Angel Troupe at the start of the series. Her hobby is making [[tea]] and [[cooking]] [[snack]]s, particularly [[cake]]. The flowers on her head can spin and make her fly or hover in the air. Her first name is derived from the name for the [[France|French]] [[pastry]] [[mille-feuille]]. Voiced by [[Ryoko Shintani]] in the original and [[Jocelyn Loewen]] in the English dub.

'''In the games'''
An original member of the Angel Troupe, Milfeulle is always caring and cheerful, and will never hesitate to help another person, even people whom are considered by others as enemies. Possessing a supernatural level of good luck, to the point where strange things keep occurring around her, sometimes causing great annoyance to others, but always in some ways beneficial to herself. Even in normal situations, like tossing a coin, she will get all heads or all tails. By the definition given in the game, Milfeulle has the ability to fail all probability measures and cause one outcome to be 100%.

'''''Mint Blancmanche (<U+30DF><U+30F3><U+30C8> <U+30D6><U+30E9><U+30DE><U+30F3><U+30B7><U+30E5>)'''''

[[Image:Mint s.gif|left]]

:''Main article: [[Mint Blancmanche]]''
'''In the anime'''
A blue-haired girl who loves to wear full body costumes, but will never, ever be seen by her friends while wearing them (unless it's work-related). Her family is wealthy and she sometimes comes off snobbish, but she normally has a sincere, distinguished politeness in her voice when in conversations with others. She has a dark side, as she can sometimes be selfish to the point of letting her fellow Angels die rather than be embarrassed, and she likes to play mean pranks on the less-than-bright Ranpha. She also can read minds or emotions in some situations. She has a pair of white rabbit ear-like appendages just above her normal ears that twitch, rise or droop depending on her feelings. The ears also allow her to fly or hover in the air. Her last name is derived from the name for the [[dessert]] [[blancmange]].  Voiced by [[Miyuki Sawashiro]] in the original and [[Nicole Bouma]] in the English dub.

'''In the games'''
Possessing telepathic abilities, Mint possesses the ability to read the thoughts of others, even if she doesn't want to. This led to her becoming reluctant to be with others outside the Angel Troupe. As in the anime, Mint comes from the Blancmanche family, a rich and powerful business family, the family is so powerful that, despite the rest of the Transbaal Empire being in chaos, it can still provide resources for Elsior. She also enjoys dressing up in costumes and to her horror is seen by Takuto while dressed as a giant hamster. She pilots the Emblem Frame "Trick Master", which is armed with "Fliers", remotely-controlled weapons similar to the [[Psycommu system]] weapons of the UC [[Gundam]] universe: namely, the funnels or bits of the mecha [[Elmeth]], [[Sazabi]] or [[Nu Gundam]].

'''''Ranpha Franboise (<U+862D><U+82B1> <U+30D5><U+30E9><U+30F3><U+30DC><U+30EF><U+30FC><U+30BA>)'''''

[[Image:Ranpha s.gif|left]]

:''Main article: [[ Ranpha Franboise]]''
'''In the anime'''
A [[blonde]], vain beauty usually featured in a red [[qipao|Chinese dress]] with remarkable physical strength. Her hobby is fortune-telling, and she's even successful at times. Her predominant yet ultimately futile obsession is attempting to snag rich (and preferably handsome) men, which rarely appear in the series. Usually when she does meet these men she completely falls apart and makes a total fool of herself.  Although apparently pushy she is actually very sensitive, though can come off as domineering. The two metallic things on her head are weapons.  Voiced by [[Yukari Tamura]] in the original and [[Nicole Leroux]] in the English dub.

'''In the games'''
Generally the same, though nowhere near as obsessed with men like in the anime. Became friends with Milfeulle in the military academy and considers her a rival, but is defeated on every occasion due to Milfeulle's luck. Proud and often harsh, some may find it difficult to approach Ranpha, let alone start a conversation with her. However, behind her tough exterior is a kind person whom is always willing to put the feelings of others before herself.
<br style="clear:left;" />

'''''Forte Stollen (<U+30D5><U+30A9><U+30EB><U+30C6>  <U+30B7><U+30E5><U+30C8><U+30FC><U+30EC><U+30F3>)'''''

[[Image:Forte s.gif|left]]

:''Main article: [[ Forte Stollen]]''
'''In the anime'''
A frank, husky-voiced, [[tomboy|boyish]] [[red hair|redhead]] in a stylized [[military]] [[uniform]] complete with hat and [[monocle]]. Her hobby is collecting [[gun]]s and other [[weapon]]s, and is a strong believer in applied force to many situations. She is scared of and allergic to [[mouse|mice]]. Voiced by [[Mayumi Yamaguchi]] in the original and [[Allison Matthews]] in the English dub.

'''In the games'''
Similar to the anime, and is the leader of the Angel Troupe. Being the oldest, Forte acts as the big sister of the group, often giving advice to others. Like many of the other characters in the first game, Forte is less than impressed with the appointment of Takuto as the commander of the Elsior and bluntly tells him that she will not consider him her commander until he proves himself. He eventually does, and she begins to trust him as much as she would her teammates on the Angels. 
<br style="clear:left;" />

'''''Vanilla H (<U+30F4><U+30A1><U+30CB><U+30E9> H)'''''

[[Image:Vanilla s.gif|left]]

:''Main article: [[ Vanilla H]]''
'''In the anime'''
A green-haired pale-colored young girl who rarely speaks, and always in a calm, deadpan voice. Most of the time, when she speaks, she refers to [[God]]. She has a strange machine, known as the ''Nanomachine'', in her room. Despite all of this, she is quite caring and always follows orders. She is also apparently the possessor of a hot temper, but keeps it well-hidden. She can heal the injuries of others, the effects made visible by a green glow around her hands, and the red gem at her forehead can sometimes project a powerful beam. She carries around the stuffed animal in which Normad's chip has been place, but she's not as devoted to Normad as he is to her. Voiced by [[Mika Kanai]] in the original and [[Anna Cummer]] in the English dub.

'''In the games'''
Vanilla possess the ability to control nanomachines to perform various things, such as altering her appearance to healing wounds. However, she requires a great deal of mental control in order to control the nanomachines, and thus suppresses her emotions in order to utilize the nanomachines more efficiently. Despite seemingly acting without emotions, Vanilla is very caring, and often works herself helping others to the point of exhaustion. She is the pilot of the Emblem Frame "Harvester", which is a giant nanomachine colony and is used to repair/resupply the other Angel Frames during combat. Her pet cat that is always seen on her is actually constructed out of nanomachines, and expresses her emotions for her.

'''''Chitose Karasuma (<U+70CF><U+4E38> <U+3061><U+3068><U+305B>)'''''

[[Image:Chitose s.gif|left]]

:''Main article: [[Chitose Karasuma]]''
'''In the anime'''
Introduced in the fourth season, Chitose is a purportedly sickly, navy blue-haired girl who joins the Angel Team. Although she wishes to make friends, she is very clumsy about it. Her attitude towards the team (especially Milfeuille) flipflops between vengefulness and self-imagined ostracism. Some consider her an insecure (platonic) love addict albeit with good intentions. Voiced by [[Saori Goto]] in the original; As the fourth season has not yet been dubbed, Chitose is yet to have an English voice actor.

'''In the games'''
Introduced for the first time in Moonlit Lovers, Chitose became the replacement for one of the original Galaxy Angel members who left the team in order to be with Takuto. A traditional, polite, and soft-spoken young woman, Chitose joined the military for two reasons; for her respect and admiration for both her father and the Angel Troupe. Extremely intelligent, Chitose became an elite within the military, scoring the highest marks ever in the military exam, defeating even Milfeulle (whom scored the second highest due to her luck).

:''Main article: [[ Takuto Meyers]]''
The newly appointed commander of the Elsior along with the Angel Troupe. Is widely known to be both a skirt chaser as well as a slacker. Seemingly completely carefree, Takuto may seem to be an incompetent captain, but when things get serious, his personality changes completely, becoming serious and devoted to the task ahead. Is close friends with his first officer Lester Cooldaras.

Bridge crew and operators of the Elsior. Almo is a purple-haired girl, while Koko has brown hair and wears glasses. Like many other characters in the first game, they were dubious at best of Takuto Meyers' ability to lead.

[[Image:Shatoyan s.gif|left]]
Revered by the people of Transbaal, and said to be the one whom brought peace and prosperity to the Transbaal Kingdom, Shatoyan resides within the White Moon itself. When Prince Eonia initiated his coup d'etat, Shatoyan sealed both herself and the White Moon within an energy barrier, which is completely unbreakable by any known means. Shatoyan also sent both the Angel Troupe as well as the Elsior to ensure Prince Shiva's safety. Other than Prince Shiva, Shatoyan is the only other person with knowledge of what the White Moon really is... Voiced by [[Kikuko Inoue]] (<U+4E95><U+4E0A><U+559C><U+4E45><U+5B50>).

In the games, he helps Takuto sort out his feelings for his chosen Angel, and plays a fairly instrumental role in the start of their relationship.

Noah is the leader of the Black Moon. Though appearing to be only 10 years old, she is in fact more than 600 years of age, and is rumored to have been the overseer of the White Moon's creation. This age also suggests she was alive before the Chrono Quake.

Eonia is the main adversary in the first game and manga series, as well as Shiva's older brother.

:''Main article: [[ Normad]]''
An [[artificial intelligence|AI]] recovered from a [[missile]] that was floating in space. He never completed his mission because he didn't want to die, which is what would have happened if his warhead detonated. He is later placed into a [[stuffed animal]] vaguely resembling a rotund, pink [[cat]]/[[penguin]]. Normad usually has endless praise for Vanilla (despite her on-and-off nonchalant abandonment and abuse towards him) but has cynical views toward the rest of the Angel Team, especially Milfuelle, whom he calls a dimwit, and Forte, who returns the favor and routinely shoots him. Aside from occasional descriptive information he supplies, he mainly provides comic relief due to his inability to avoid injury.  His name might have been inspired by NORAD, which warns against attacks by missiles, corresponding to his original role. Normad's voice is performed by Mika Kanai (Vanilla). As for the English dub, he is portrayed by [[Richard Ian Cox]].

Two young boys (brothers) who make occasional appearances in the second and later seasons. They work under a female commander, Major Mary, much in the same was as the Angel Team, but seem more capable. They coincidently resemble the young boys in another Broccoli production, [[Di Gi Charat]] (the characters of which make a few very brief [[cameo|cameos]]). Polar opposites, Cocomo is hotheaded, naive and obsesses over parfait, whilst Malibu is reserved, thoughtful and enjoys reading. [[Yuko Sanpei]] (<U+4E09><U+74F6><U+7531><U+5E03><U+5B50>) does Cocomo while [[Tomo Saeki]] (<U+30B5><U+30A8><U+30AD><U+30C8><U+30E2>) does Malibu.

The Hell Hounds are virtually male counterparts of the Angels (with the possible exception of Riserva). Where the Angels are named after desserts, the Hell Hounds have the names of various kinds of alcoholic drinks. He seems to hold a particular fondness for Milfeulle, often referring to her as "ma cherie", and sometimes mysteriously leaving her "Space Roses" in her bed.

'''Emblem Frames'''
{{main| List of Angel frames|List of Emblem Frames}}
Designed with Lost Technology, all Emblem Frames possesses more advanced technology than even the latest military starship, with equipment such as Gravity Generators, Shielding, as well as a Chrono Drive System, which allows them to travel at high speeds across the galaxy. It is said that just a single Emblem Frames is equivalent to that of an entire fleet. However, it is discovered in the first game that the simulation of a single frame defeating the entire fleet happens to be just Milfeulle's luck. The computer system eventually controlled the fleet to fire at each other and losing to Lucky Star without almost any resistance. Each Emblem Frame is controlled by both the pilot's thoughts and emotions (via the H.A.L.O. System), and if their emotions become unstable, the less efficient the Emblem Frame becomes, to the point where it ceases to function all together.

'''Elsior (<U+30A8><U+30EB><U+30B7><U+30AA><U+30FC><U+30EB>, pronounced E-Lu-Shior)'''

Flagship of the Angel Troupe, and under the authority of Shatoyan herself, the Elsior is like the Angel Frames, the construction of Lost Technology. While the Elsior is a ceremonial ship of peace and relies almost completely on the Emblem Frames for defence, it is not without weapons systems. Unfortunately, compared to most enemy ships, the Elsior is still woefully underequipped. It is large enough to contain a huge park, a convenience store and a massive room known as the Kujira (Whale) Room where many animals (including Space Rabbits and Space Cats) are kept. In addition, in times of great need the Elsior can be equipped with a devastating weapon known as the Chrono Break Cannon. Following the events of Moonlit Lovers, however, the Chrono Break Cannon was equipped to the newly activated Emblem Frame GA-007 and was heavily damaged during the battle to liberate EDEN from the Val-Fasq.

Like the Emblem Frames, the existence of the Elsior is surrounded in mystery, and there are things onboard that no one knows nor understands completely. No one, except perhaps the Goddess Shatoyan herself... 

It was claimed in the first game that, since the crew of the ship is mainly the Lost Technology research staff from the White Moon, they are mostly female. Since then, there are a number of male crew members, transferred along with Takuto and Lester from their previous command.

Formerly under the command of General Ruft, the Elsior is now under the command of Takuto Meyers, with Lester Cooldaras as his second in command.

On another note, according to the special sticker the name of the ship is actually the Elle Ciel. This has caused some confusion among some fans, as Elle Ciel would have been written "<U+30A8><U+30EB><U+30B7><U+30A8>-<U+30EB>" (E-Lu-Shi-E-Lu).

Statistics of the Elsior (according to a special sticker included with Eternal Lovers):
*Length: 846.0m
*Width: 274.0m
*Height: 392.0m
*Conventional Weapons: Long Range Rail Gun, Long Range Missiles, Medium-range lasers
*Additional equipment: Ultimate weapon 'Chrono Break Cannon'
