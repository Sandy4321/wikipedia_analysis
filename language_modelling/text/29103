'''Botany''', '''plant science'''('''s'''), or '''plant biology''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|<U+03B2><U+03BF><U+03C4><U+03AC><U+03BD><U+03B7>}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|botane}}'', "[[pasture]], [[grass]], or [[fodder]]" and that from {{lang|grc|<U+03B2><U+03CC><U+03C3><U+03BA><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03BD>}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|boskein}}'', "to feed or to graze"), a discipline of [[biology]], is the [[science]] of plant [[life]].{{sfn|Liddell|Scott|1940}}{{sfn|Gordh|Headrick|2001|p=134}}{{sfn|Online Etymology Dictionary|2012}} Traditionally, the science included the study of fungi, algae, and viruses.

Botany covers a wide range of scientific disciplines including [[Plant morphology|structure]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[reproduction]], [[metabolism]], [[morphogenesis|development]], [[phytopathology|diseases]], chemical properties, and evolutionary relationships among taxonomic groups. Botany began with early human efforts to identify edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, making it one of the oldest branches of science. Nowadays, botanists study about 400,000 [[species]] of living organisms.

The beginnings of modern-style classification systems can be traced to the 1500s-1600s when several attempts were made to scientifically classify plants. In the 19th and 20th centuries, major new techniques were developed for studying plants, including [[microscopy]], chromosome counting, and analysis of plant chemistry. In the last two decades of the 20th century, [[DNA]] was used to more accurately classify plants.

Botanical research focuses on plant population groups, evolution, physiology, structure, and systematics. Subdisciplines of botany include agronomy, forestry, horticulture, and paleobotany. Key scientists in the history of botany include [[Theophrastus]], [[Ibn al-Baitar]], [[Carl Linnaeus]], [[Gregor Johann Mendel]], and [[Norman Borlaug]].

==History==
{{Main|History of botany}}
[[File:Botany.jpg|thumb|right|The traditional tools of a botanist]]

===Early botany===
The [[history of botany]] begins with ancient writings on, and classifications of, plants. Such writings are found in several early cultures. Examples of early botanical works have been found in [[ancient India]]n sacred texts, ancient [[Zoroastrian]] writings,{{sfn|Iyer|2009|p=117}} and ancient Chinese works.

[[Theophrastus]] (c. 371<U+2013>287 BC) has been frequently referred to as the <U+201D>father of botany<U+201D>.{{sfn|Grene|Depew|2004|p=11}} The [[Ancient Greece|Greco]]-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] world produced a number of botanical works including [[Theophrastus]]'s [[Historia Plantarum]] and [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides']] De [[Materia Medica]] from the first century.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|p=532}} 

Works from the medieval Muslim world included [[Ibn Wahshiyya]]'s Nabatean Agriculture, [[Ab<U+016B> <U+1E24>an<U+012B>fa D<U+012B>nawar<U+012B>]]'s (828-896) the ''Book of Plants'', and [[Ibn Bassal]]'s ''The Classification of Soils''. In the early 13th century, Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, and [[Ibn al-Baitar]] (d. 1248) also wrote on botany.{{sfn|Dallal|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Panaino|2002|p=93}}{{sfn|Levey|1973|p=116}}

===Early modern botany===

[[File:H J N Crantz Classis cruciformium.jpg|thumb|[[Heinrich Johann Nepomuk von Crantz|Crantz]]'s ''Classis cruciformium...'', 1769]]
[[Germany|German]] physician [[Leonhart Fuchs]] (1501<U+2013>1566) was one of "the three founding fathers of botany", along with [[Otto Brunfels]] (1489<U+2013>1534) and [[Hieronymus Bock]] (1498<U+2013>1554) (also called Hieronymus Tragus).{{sfn|National Museum of Wales|2007}}{{sfn|Yaniv|Bachrach|2005|p=157}}

[[Valerius Cordus]] (1515<U+2013>1544) authored a [[pharmacopoeia]] of lasting importance, the ''Dispensatorium'' in 1546.{{sfn|Sprague|1939}} [[Conrad von Gesner]] (1516<U+2013>1565) and [[Nicholas Culpeper]] (1616<U+2013>1654) also published herbals covering the medicinal uses of plants. [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]] (1522<U+2013>1605) was considered the "father of natural history", which included the study of plants. In 1665, using an early microscope, [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[cell (biology)|cells]], a term he coined, in [[cork (material)|cork]], and a short time later in living plant tissue.{{sfn|Waggoner|2001}} 

During the 18th century, systems of classification were developed that are comparable to diagnostic keys, where taxa are artificially grouped in pairs. The sequence of the taxa in keys is often unrelated to their natural or phyletic groupings.{{sfn|Scharf|2009|pp=73-117}} By the 18th century an increasing number of new plants had arrived in Europe from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide and a larger number of plants became available for study. Botanical guides from this time were sparsely illustrated.{{sfn|Scharf|2009|pp=73-74}} In 1754 [[Carolus Linnaeus|Carl von Linn<U+00E9>]] (Carl Linnaeus) divided the plant Kingdom into 25 classes in a [[taxonomy]] with a standardized binomial naming system for animal and plant species. He used a two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the genus and the second the species.{{sfn|Capon|2005|pp=220<U+2013>223}} One of Linnaeus' classifications, the ''Cryptogamia'', included all plants with concealed reproductive parts (mosses, liverworts and ferns), and algae and fungi.{{sfn|Hoek|Mann|Jahns|2005|p=9}}

The increased knowledge of [[plant anatomy|anatomy]], [[plant morphology|morphology]] and life cycles, led to the realization that there were more natural affinities between plants than the sexual system of Linnaeus indicated. [[Adanson]] (1763), [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu|de Jussieu]] (1789), and [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle|Candolle]] (1819) all proposed various alternative natural systems that were widely followed. The ideas of [[natural selection]] as a mechanism for [[evolution]] required adaptations to the [[Candollean system]], which started the studies on evolutionary relationships and [[Phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetic classification]]s of plants.{{sfn|Ereshefsky |1997|pp=493<U+2013>519}}{{sfn|Gray|Sargent|1889|pp=292<U+2013>293}}

Botany was greatly stimulated by the appearance of the first "modern" text book, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Matthias Schleiden]]'s ''{{lang|de|Grundzuge der Wissenschaftlichen}}'', published in English in 1849 as ''Principles of Scientific Botany''.{{sfn|Morton|1981|p=377}} [[Carl Ludwig Willdenow|Carl Willdenow]] examined the connection between [[seed dispersal]] and distribution, the nature of plant associations, and the impact of geological history. The cell nucleus was discovered by [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] in 1831.{{sfn|Harris|2000|pp=76<U+2013>81}}

===Modern botany===
A considerable amount of new knowledge today is being generated from studying [[model organisms|model plants]] like ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''. This weedy species in the mustard family was one of the first plants to have its [[genome]] sequenced. The sequencing of the [[rice]] (''Oryza sativa'') genome, its relatively small genome, and a large international research community have made rice an important [[cereal]]/[[grass]]/[[monocot]] model.{{sfn|Devos|Gale|2000}} Another grass species, ''[[Brachypodium distachyon]]'' is also an experimental model for understanding genetic, cellular and molecular biology.{{sfn|University of California-Davis|2012}} Other commercially important staple foods like [[wheat]], [[maize]], [[barley]], [[rye]], [[pearl millet]] and [[soybean]] are also having their genomes sequenced. Some of these are challenging to sequence because they have more than two [[haploid]] (n) sets of [[chromosome]]s, a condition known as [[polyploid]]y, common in the plant kingdom. A green [[Algae|alga]], ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'', is a model organism that has proven important in advancing knowledge of cell biology.{{sfn|Ben-Menahem|2009|p=5370}}

In 1998 the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] published a [[phylogeny]] of flowering plants based on an analysis of [[DNA]] sequences from most families of flowering plants. As a result of this work, many of the questions such as which families represent the earliest branches of [[angiosperms]] have now been answered. Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants.{{sfn|Chase et al.|2003|pp=399<U+2013>436}} Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various taxa.{{sfn|Capon|2005|p=223}}

==Scope and importance of botany==
[[File:Beli-hibiskus.jpg|right|thumb|[[Hibiscus]]]]
[[molecular biology|Molecular]], [[genetics|genetic]] and [[biochemistry|biochemical]] level through [[organelle]]s, [[cell biology|cells]], [[biological tissue|tissues]], [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], individuals, plant [[population]]s, and communities of plants are all aspects of plant life that are studied. At each of these levels a botanist might be concerned with the classification ([[taxonomy]]), structure ([[Plant anatomy|anatomy]] and [[Plant morphology|morphology]]), or function ([[Plant physiology|physiology]]) of plant life.{{sfn|Ben-Menahem|2009|p=5368}}

Historically, all living things were grouped as either animals or plants,{{sfn|Chapman et al.|2001|p=56}} and botany covered the study of all organisms not considered to be [[animal]]s. Now, plants are considered to be organisms that obtain their energy from sunlight by means of [[photosynthesis]] and some closely related, [[chlorophyll]]-free parasitic plants. Other organisms previously included in the field of botany include [[bacterium|bacteria]], (studied in [[bacteriology]]), [[fungi]], ([[mycology]]) including [[lichen]]-forming fungi ([[lichenology]]), non-[[Chlorophyta|chlorophyte]] [[alga]]e ([[phycology]]) and [[viruses]] ([[virology]]). However, attention is still given to these groups by botanists, and fungi (including lichens), and photosynthetic [[protist]]s are usually covered in introductory botany courses.{{sfn|Capon|2005|pp=10<U+2013>11}}{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=1<U+2013>3}}

The study of plants is vital because they are a fundamental part of [[life on Earth]], which generates the [[oxygen]] and [[food]] that allow humans and other life forms to exist. Through [[photosynthesis]], plants absorb [[carbon dioxide]], a [[greenhouse gas]] that in large amounts can affect global climate. Just as importantly for us, plants release oxygen into the atmosphere during photosynthesis. Additionally, they prevent [[soil erosion]] and are influential in the [[water cycle]].{{sfn|Gust|1996}} Plants are crucial to the future of human society as they provide food, oxygen, medicine, and products for people; as well as creating and preserving soil.{{sfn|Missouri Botanical Garden|2009}} [[paleobotany|Paleobotanists]] study ancient plants in the fossil record. It is believed that early in the Earth's history, the evolution of photosynthetic plants altered the global [[atmosphere]] of the earth, changing the ancient atmosphere by [[oxidation]].{{sfn|Cleveland Museum of Natural History|2012}}

===Human nutrition===
[[File:US long grain rice.jpg|right|thumb|Nearly all the food we eat comes (directly and indirectly) from plants, such as this American long grain [[rice]]]]
Virtually all foods come either directly from plants, or indirectly from animals that eat plants.{{sfn|Ben-Menahem|2009|pp=5367<U+2013>5368}} Plants are the fundamental base of nearly all [[food chain]]s because they use the energy from the sun and nutrients from the soil and atmosphere, converting them into a form that can be consumed and utilized by animals; this is what ecologists call the first [[trophic level]].{{sfn|Butz|2007|pp=534<U+2013>553}} Botanists also study how plants produce food we can eat and how to increase yields and therefore their work is important in mankind's ability to feed the world and provide [[food security]] for future generations, for example, through [[plant breeding]].{{sfn|Floros|Newsome|Fisher|2010}} Botanists also study [[weed]]s, plants which are considered to be a nuisance in a particular location. Weeds are a considerable problem in [[agriculture]], and botany provides some of the basic science used to understand how to minimize 'weed' impact in agriculture and native [[ecosystems]].{{sfn|Schoening|2005}} [[Ethnobotany]] is the study of the relationships between plants and people. When this kind of study is turned to the investigation of plant-people relationships in past times, it is referred to as archaeobotany or [[paleoethnobotany]].{{sfn|Acharya|Anshu|2008|p=440}}

===Fundamental life processes===
Botanical research has long had relevance to the understanding of fundamental biological processes other than just botany. Fundamental life processes such as [[cell division]] and [[protein synthesis]] can be studied using plants without the moral issues that come with conducting studies upon animals or humans. [[Gregor Mendel]] discovered the [[Mendelian inheritance|genetic laws of inheritance]] in this fashion by studying ''[[Pisum sativum]]'' ([[peas|pea]]) inherited traits such as shape. What Mendel learned from studying plants has had far reaching benefits outside of botany. Similarly, '[[transposon|jumping genes]]' were discovered by [[Barbara McClintock]] while she was studying [[maize]].{{sfn|Ben-Menahem|2009|p=5369}}

===Medicine and materials===
Many [[medication|medicinal]] and [[recreational drugs]], like [[tetrahydrocannabinol]], [[caffeine]], and [[nicotine]] come directly from the plant kingdom. Others are simple [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] of botanical natural products; for example, the pain killer [[aspirin]] is derived from [[salicylic acid]] which originally came from the [[bark]] of [[willow]] trees. As well, the [[narcotic]] [[analgesics]] such as [[morphine]] are derived from the [[opium poppy]].{{sfn|Mann|1987|pp=186<U+2013>187}} There may be many [[drug discovery|novel cures for diseases]] provided by plants, waiting to be discovered. Popular [[stimulant]]s like [[coffee]], [[chocolate]], [[tobacco]], and [[tea]] also come from plants. Most [[alcoholic beverage]]s come from [[fermentation (food)|fermenting]] plants such as [[barley]] ([[beer]]), [[rice]] ([[sake]]) and [[grapes]] ([[wine]]).{{sfn|University of Maryland Medical Center|2011}}

[[Hemp]], [[cotton]], [[wood]], [[paper]], [[linen]], [[vegetable oil]]s, some types of [[rope]], and [[rubber]] are examples of materials made from plants. [[Silk]] can only be made by using the [[mulberry]] plant. [[Sugarcane]], [[rapeseed]], [[soy]] are some of the plants with a highly fermentable sugar or oil content which have recently been put to use as sources of [[biofuel]]s, which are important alternatives to [[fossil fuel]]s (see [[biodiesel]]).{{sfn|Scharlemann|Laurance|2008|pp=52<U+2013>53}}

===Environmental changes===
In many different ways, plants can act a little like the '[[Domestic Canary|miners' canary']], an early warning system alerting us to important changes in our environment. Plants respond to and provide understanding of changes in the environment:{{sfn|Ben-Menahem|2009|pp=5369<U+2013>5370}}
{{refbegin|2}}
* Plant [[systematics]] and taxonomy are essential to understanding [[habitat destruction]] and [[endangered species|species extinction]].
* [[Ultraviolet|Ultraviolet radiation]] causes changes in plants which help in studying problems like [[ozone depletion]].
* [[Palynology|Analyzing pollen]] found in fossils and sediment from [[geologic timescale|thousands or millions of years ago]] allows reconstruction of past climates and the prediction of future ones. This is essential to [[climate change]] research.
* Study of plant [[biological life cycle|life cycles]] is an important part of [[phenology]], which is used in climate-change research.
{{refend}}

==Ecology==
The biology of a population is greater than the collective biologies of its individuals. Multiple members of the same species in close proximity constitute a [[population]]. Different populations in proximity constitute a [[Community (ecology)|community]], which in conjunction with its nonliving environment constitute an [[ecosystem]]. The relation of each organism to all other organisms and factors in its habitat and environment make up its [[ecology]]. This includes structure, genetics and mutations, metabolism, diversity, fitness, adaptation, climate, water, and soil condition. The conditions that constitute an organisms life cycle is its [[habitat]].{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=786<U+2013>818}} Both negative and beneficial interactions with other organisms are parts of a plant's ecology. [[Herbivore]]s eat plants, but plants can also [[plant defence against herbivory|defend themselves]]. Some other organisms form beneficial relationships with plants, called [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]s, for example with [[mycorrhiza|mycorrhizal fungi]] that provide nutrients, and [[honey bee]]s that [[pollinate]] flowers. A [[biome]] is a large part of the earth that has very similar [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] and [[Biotic components|biotic]] factors,  [[climate]], and [[geography]], creating a typical ecosystem over that area that is characterized by its dominant plants. Examples include [[tundra]] and [[tropical rainforest]].{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=819<U+2013>848}}

==Evolution==
[[File:Punnett square mendel flowers.svg|right|thumb|A [[Punnett square]] depicting a cross between two pea plants heterozygous for purple (B) and white (b) blossoms]]
DNA provides the information for a plant's structure, metabolism, and biology. [[Genetics]] is the science of inheritance and the [[gene]] is its chemical unit. The same basic laws of genetics apply to both plants and animals. In sexual reproduction, offspring are often more fit than either parent since the stronger genes tend to be passed on to the next generation.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=468<U+2013>501}} Mutations and natural selection result in a species acquiring new traits and eventually evolving into one or more new species. [[Population genetics]] is the study of [[allele frequency]] distribution and change under the influence of the four main evolutionary  processes: [[natural selection]], [[genetic drift]], [[mutation]] and [[gene flow]]. Changes can also be caused by natural events such as a large meteor hitting Earth and selective breeding (artificial selection) of plants  by humans for specific traits.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=502<U+2013>527}}

Since the mid-20th century, there has been considerable debate over how the earliest forms of life evolved and how to classify them, especially at the kingdom and domain levels and organisms that are or have been considered bacteria. For example, the [[three-domain system]] separates [[Archaea]] and [[Bacteria]], previously grouped into the single kingdom [[Monera]] (bacteria). Archaea was separated because it was shown to have a different evolutionary history. However, [[Thomas Cavalier-Smith]] rejects the three-domain system and places the Archaea as a subkingdom of Bacteria. [[Cyanobacteria]] were once believed to be related to algae and hence studied by botanists. Even now they are studied by both botanists and bacteriologists.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=552-581}}{{sfn|Copeland|1938|pp=383-420}}{{sfn|Woese et al.|1977|pp=305-311}}{{sfn|Cavalier-Smith|2004|pp=1251-1262}} Similarly, the [[Fungi]] (or Myceteae) were once considered plants but there is now uncertainty about how to classify them.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=582<U+2013>616}}

The various divisions of algae are also taxonomically problematic as some are more clearly linked to plants than others. Their many differences in features such as biochemistry, pigmentation, and nutrient reserves show that they diverged very early in evolutionary time. The division [[Chlorophyta]] (green algae) is considered the ancestor of true plants. {{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=617<U+2013>654}}

Nonvascular plants are [[embryophyte]]s that do not have vascular tissue: [[moss]]es, [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s, and [[hornwort]]s. Many plants that are called "moss" are not true mosses. For example, [[Spanish moss]] (''Tillandsia usneoides'') is actually in the [[Bromeliaceae]] (pineapple) family. Nonvascular plants do not have [[xylem]] nor [[phloem]].{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=655<U+2013>681}} After the development of xylem and phloem, vascualar plants developed along two lines: [[cryptogam]]s which reproduce by spores and which developed first, and [[spermatophyte]]s, which reproduce by seed.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=682<U+2013>719}} The spermatophytes further developed into [[gymnosperm]]s, plants that produce seeds not enclosed in an ovary. Modern gymnosperms include [[Pinophyta|conifers]], [[cycad]]s, [[Ginkgo]], and [[Gnetophyta|Gnetales]]. Gymnosperms are the ancestors of the [[flowering plant|Angiosperms]] or flowering plants which produce a seed encased in a structure such as a [[Gynoecium|carpel]].{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=720<U+2013>750}}{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=751<U+2013>785}}

==Physiology==
{{further|Autotroph}}
[[File:Plant physiology.png|thumb|left|240px|Five key areas of study within plant physiology.]]
Plant physiology encompasses all the internal chemical and physical activities of plants associated with life.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=278<U+2013>279}} Sunlight, either through photosynthesis or [[cellular respiration]], is the basis of all life. [[Phototroph|Photoautotroph]]s gather energy directly from sunlight. This includes all green plants, [[cyanobacteria]] and other bacteria that can photosynthesize. [[Heterotroph]]s take in organic molecules and respire them. This includes all animals, all fungi, all completely parasitic plants, and non-photosynthetic bacteria.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=280<U+2013>314}} Respiration is the oxidation of carbon whereby it is broken down into simpler structures; essentially the opposite of photosynthesis.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=315<U+2013>340}}

Transport processes are those by which molecules are moved within the organism, such as: membranes transporting material across themselves and [[enzyme]]s moving electrons. This is how minerals and water get from roots to other parts of the plant. [[Diffusion]], [[osmosis]], and [[active transport]] are different ways transport can occur.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=341<U+2013>372}} Examples of [[plant nutrition|elements that plants need]] are:  [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], and [[sulphur]]. Chemicals from the air, soil, and water in combination with sunlight form the basis of [[plant metabolism]]. Most of these elements come from minerals in a process called mineral nutrition.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=373<U+2013>398}} Few plants live in stable unchanging environments. Most plants must adapt to a variety of environmental factors, including changes in temperature, light and moisture. The better a plant can cope with these changing conditions, the more likely it is to be able to survive over both the short and long term as well as establish itself over a wider geographic range.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=399<U+2013>432}}

==Structure==
[[File:Lilium superbum.jpg|thumb|125px|right|Roots, stems, leaves, and flowers of ''[[Lilium superbum]]''.]]
[[Plant anatomy]] is the study of the internal cells and tissues of a plant; whereas [[plant morphology]] is the study of their general and external form.{{sfn|Raven|Evert|Eichhorn|2005|p=9}} 

Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. All [[organism]]s have [[cell (biology)|cells]], the cell types are unique and their nuclei store most of the DNA.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=433<U+2013>467}} [[Cell biology]] studies their structural and [[physiology|physiological]] properties. This includes responses to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], reproduction, and development on the [[macroscopic scale]], [[microscope|microscopic scale]], and [[molecule|molecular]] level. The similarities and differences between the function of a cell are quite varied.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=50<U+2013>58}} Plant cells are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]], ie, have a membrane-encased [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] that carries genetic material.{{sfn|National Center for Biotechnology Information|2004}} With rare exceptions, plant cells also have a [[central vacuole]], [[cytoplasm]], [[cytosol]], [[Golgi apparatus|dictyosomes]], [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[microbody|microbodies]], [[microfilament]]s, [[microtubule]]s, [[mitochondria]], [[plasma membrane]], [[plastid]]s, [[protoplasm]], [[ribosomes]], storage products, and a [[cell wall]].{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=62<U+2013>81}} Cells divide by processes known as [[karyokinesis]] and [[cytokinesis]].{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=96<U+2013>103}}

The body of a plant contains three basic parts: roots, stems, and leaves. Roots anchor it to the ground, gather water and mineral nutrients from the soil, and produce hormones. Roots which spread out close to the surface, such as those of willows, can produce shoots and ultimately new plants. Fleshy taproots, such as those of beets and carrots, store carbohydrates.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=185<U+2013>208}} Stems provide support to the leaves and store nutrients. Leaves gather sunlight and begin [[photosynthesis]].{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=114<U+2013>153}} Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=154<U+2013>184}} [[Gymnosperms]] are seed-producing plants which have open seeds, such as [[conifer]]s, [[cycad]]s, ''[[Gingko]]'', and [[gnetophyta]].{{sfn|Capon|2005|p=11}} [[Angiosperms]] are [[Spermatophyte|seed-producing plants]] that produce [[flower]]s, having enclosed seeds. Some of the gymnosperms became the ancestors of the angiosperms.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=720<U+2013>750}} Woody plants, such as [[azalea]]s and [[oak]]s, undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (secondary [[xylem]]) and bark (secondary [[phloem]] and [[Cork cambium|cork]]). All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=209<U+2013>243}} Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=244<U+2013>277}}

==Systematics==
{{further|Biological classification}}

[[File:SN1 Regnum Vegetabile.png|thumb|left|Linnaeus's table of the Plant Kingdom ("Regnum Vegetabile") from the first edition of ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735).]]
[[Biological classification|Scientific classification in botany]] is a method by which botanists group and categorize [[organism]]s by [[biological type]], such as [[genus]] or [[species]]. Biological classification is a form of [[Taxonomy|scientific taxonomy]]. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of [[Carolus Linnaeus]], who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to improve consistency with the [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] principle of [[common descent]]. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, [[molecular phylogenetics]], which uses [[DNA sequences]] as data, has driven many recent revisions along more efficient, evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. Botanical classification belongs to the science of [[systematics|plant systematics]]. The dominant classification system is called the [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. It includes ranks and [[binomial nomenclature]]. The classification, [[taxonomy]], and nomenclature of botanical organisms is administered by the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN).{{sfn|McNeill et al.|2006}}{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=528<U+2013>551}}

The [[five-kingdom system]] has largely been superseded by modern alternative classification systems. Textbooks generally begin with the [[three-domain system]]: [[Archaea]] (originally Archaebacteria); [[Bacterium|Bacteria]] (originally Eubacteria); [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]] (including [[protist]]s, [[fungi]], [[plants]], and [[animal]]s). These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of the cell exteriors and ribosomes.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=528<U+2013>551}}{{sfn|Woese|Kandler|Wheelis|1990|pp=4576<U+2013>4579}}

Further, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is:
[[Domain (biology)|Domain]]; [[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]]; [[Phylum]]; [[Class (biology)|Class]]; [[Order (biology)|Order]]; [[Family (biology)|Family]]; [[Genus]]; [[Species]]. The scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species, resulting in a single world-wide name for each organism.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=528<U+2013>551}} For example, the [[Lilium columbianum|Tiger Lily]] is listed as ''[[Lilium columbianum]]''. ''Lilium'' is the genus, and ''columbianum'' the specific epithet. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicized or underlined. [[Phylogenetics]] is the study of similarities among different species.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp=528<U+2013>551}}{{sfn|International Association for Plant Taxonomy|2006}}{{sfn|Silyn-Roberts|2000|p=198}}
