The {{nihongo|Furai|<U+98A8><U+7C5F>|F<U+016B>rai}}, meaning "sound of the wind", was the fifth and last of the [[Mazda Nagare]] line of concept cars that have been made by Mazda since 2006. The chassis was based on the [[Courage Comp<U+00E9>tition]] C65 [[Le Mans Prototype]] that Mazda last used to compete in the [[American Le Mans Series]], two seasons previously<ref name="ABpreview"/> and was designed to use [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures|E100]] [[ethanol fuel]], it was powered by a new generation 20B 3-rotor wankel engine that put out {{convert|450|bhp}}. The engine was developed and built by renowned rotary tuner, Racing Beat, who also built the car's rotary-shaped muffler canister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingbeat.com/FRrotary.htm |title=Mazda RX-7 Performance Parts |publisher=Racingbeat.com |date=2012-05-10 |accessdate=2012-05-29}}</ref>

The car bore the #55 number that of its {{24hLM|1991}} [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] winning ancestor, the [[Mazda 787B|787B]]. Unlike many concept cars, the Furai was fully functional and was tested at various tracks. It ran at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca|Laguna Seca]] and [[Buttonwillow Raceway Park|Buttonwillow]].

Head designer, Laurens van den Acker, had stated in an interview with [[Top Gear magazine]] that there would have been possibilities of the Furai being used for racing in Le Mans, and he also had strong hopes that the car could be brought to the market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com/content/news/stories/2518/ |title=Hell hath no Furai |publisher=Top Gear |date= |accessdate=2012-05-29}}</ref>

The Mazda Furai appears in Gran Turismo 5 as a standard car.  It also appears in Gran Turismo PSP.

The 2008 Mazda Furai has been licensed to [[Gameloft]] and appears on the mobile racing video game series [[Asphalt (series)|Asphalt]] (both [[Asphalt 6: Adrenaline]] and [[Asphalt 7: Heat]]) and [[GT Racing: Motor Academy]]. In the mobile racing video game GT Racing: Motor Academy, it costs 3,500 cash making it the most expensive car in the game.

It also appears in Forza Motorsport 3 as a downloadable car and in Forza Motorsport 4 as part of the core game.

In September 2013, it was revealed that the car had been destroyed by fire during road tests by Top Gear in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com/uk/photos/TopGear-magazine-20th-anniversary-special-2013-09-10?imageNo=1 |title=SOMETIMES WE GOT IT WRONG |publisher=topgear.com |date=2013-09-10 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Mallory McMorrow |url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/features/web-originals/losing-the-mazda-furai-reactions-from-its-designer |title=Losing the Mazda Furai - A Designer Reacts - Road & Track |publisher=Roadandtrack.com |date=2013-09-10 |accessdate=2013-09-19}}</ref>

On November 29, 2013, Top Gear was given the opportunity to make the story about the Furai's demise public. It was explained that the vehicle caught on fire during a photography session at Bentwaters Parks on August 19, 2008 at 11:52 am. The location of the charred remains of the Furai are still unknown to this day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com/uk/photos/mazda-furai-concept-fire-2013-11-29 |title=How the Mazda Furai died |publisher=topgear.com |date=2013-11-29 |accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref>
