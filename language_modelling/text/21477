The '''Hundred of Kingston''' or '''Kingston Hundred''' was an ancient [[hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]] in the north east of the county of [[Surrey]], England. Its area has been mostly absorbed by the growth of [[London]]; with its name currently referring to both the suburban town of [[Kingston upon Thames]] and the larger [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames]]. Its former area now corresponds to that borough and part of the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]] in [[Greater London]] and part of the borough of [[Elmbridge]] in Surrey. It bordered the [[Hundred of Brixton]] to the east, the [[Hundred of Elmbridge]] to the south, and to the west and north by the [[River Thames]].<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=dRMAAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13 |title=General view of the agriculture of the County of Surrey |page=13|author=William Stevenson|publisher=Phillips|date= 1809 |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>
