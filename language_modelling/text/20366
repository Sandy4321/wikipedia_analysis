'''Roanoke Island''' is an island in [[Dare County, North Carolina|Dare County]] on the Outer Banks of [[North Carolina]], [[United States]]. It was named after the historical [[Roanoke (tribe)|Roanoke]] [[Carolina Algonquian]] people who inhabited the area in the 16th century at the time of English exploration.

About eight miles (12&nbsp;km) long and two miles (3&nbsp;km) wide, Roanoke Island lies between the mainland and the [[Outer Banks|barrier islands]] near [[Nags Head]], with [[Albemarle Sound]] on its north, [[Roanoke Sound]] at the eastern end, [[Croatan Sound]] to the west, and [[Wanchese, North Carolina|Wanchese]] [[census-designated place|CDP]] at the southern end. The town of [[Manteo, North Carolina|Manteo]] is located on the northern portion of the island, and is the county seat of [[Dare County]]. [[Fort Raleigh National Historic Site]] is on the north end of the island. There is a land area of {{convert|17.95|sqmi|km2}} and a population of 6,724 as of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]].

Located along [[U.S. Highway 64]], a major highway from mainland North Carolina to the [[Outer Banks]], Roanoke Island combines recreational and water features with historical sites and an outdoor theater to form one of the major tourist attractions of Dare County.

Roanoke Island has been known in [[European-American]] history for its significance as the site of Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]'s establishing of an [[English colonial empire|English settlement]] with his [[Roanoke Colony]] in 1585 and 1587. As the fate of the final group of colonists has never been determined, myths have developed about them.  Stories about the "Lost Colony" have circulated for more than 400 years. In the 21st century, as [[archaeologists]], [[historians]] and [[scientists]] continue to work to resolve the mystery, visitors come to see the second-longest-running [[outdoor theatre]] production in America: "[[Lost Colony (play)|The Lost Colony]]."

Roanoke Island is one of the three oldest surviving English place-names in the U.S. Along with the [[Chowan River|Chowan]] and [[Neuse River|Neuse]] rivers, it was named in 1584 by Captains [[Philip Amadas]] and [[Arthur Barlowe]], sent by [[Sir Walter Raleigh]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States |last= Stewart|first=George |authorlink=George R. Stewart|year=1945 |publisher= Random House|location=New York |pages= 21, 22}}</ref>

It was for thousands of years the site of ancient [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] settlements.  [[Archeological]] excavations in the early 1980s at the Tillett Site at ''Wanchese'' have revealed evidence of various cultures dating back to 8000 BC. ''Wanchese'' was used as a seasonal fishing village for 1500 years before English colonial settlement. Ancestors of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking [[Roanoke tribe|Roanoke]] coalesced as a people in about 400.<ref>[http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jmack/algonqin/phelps61.htm "Archeology of the Tillett Site"], Carolina Algonkian Project, 2002, accessed 23 April 2010</ref>

Another colony, which was much more populous than that of Raleigh's, was developed at the island during the [[American Civil War]]. After [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces took over the island in 1862, [[slaves]] migrated there for relative freedom, as they were considered [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contraband]] by the military, who would not return them to the Confederates. The Army established the [[Freedmen's Colony of Roanoke Island|Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony]] in 1863, an important [[social experiment]] as part of the US government's developing policies related to the future of the slaves in freedom. The [[Congregational]] chaplain [[Horace James]] was appointed superintendent of the colony and of other contraband camps in North Carolina. With a view to making it self-sustaining, he had a sawmill built, and freedmen were allotted lands to cultivate. Those who worked for the Army were paid wages. When the [[United States Colored Troops]] were founded, many men from the colony enlisted. A corps of Northern teachers was sponsored by the [[American Missionary Association]], and they taught hundreds of students of all ages at the colony.<ref>[http://www.roanokefreedmenscolony.com/ Patricia C.

Today the residents of Roanoke Island are governed by the [[Dare County Board of Commissioners]].  They are located within Congressional District 1 of North Carolina.

==History==

===The First Colony===
{{Main|Roanoke Colony}}
Roanoke Island was the site of the 16th-century [[Roanoke Colony]], the first [[English colonial empire|English colony]] in the [[New World]]. It was located in what was then called [[Virginia Colony|Virginia]], named in honor of England's ruling monarch and "Virgin Queen", [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. There were two groups of colonists who attempted to establish a colony there, and both failed.

The first attempt was headed by [[Ralph Lane]] in 1585. Sir [[Richard Grenville]] had transported the colonists to Virginia and returned to England for supplies as planned.  The colonists were desperately in need of supplies and Grenville's return was delayed.<ref>[http://www.mocavo.com/History-of-Virginia-for-the-Use-of-Schools/104364/21 "History of Virginia" Page 7, 1873]</ref> As a result, when Sir [[Francis Drake]] put in at Roanoke after attacking the Spanish colony of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], the entire population abandoned the colony and returned with Drake to England.

In 1587, the English again tried to settle Roanoke Island. [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]], father of the colonist Eleanor Dare, and grandfather to [[Virginia Dare]], the first English child born in the New World, left the colony to return to England for supplies. He expected to return to Roanoke Island within three months. Instead, with England at war with Spain, all ships were confiscated for use of the war efforts. White's return to Roanoke Island was delayed until 1590, by which time all the colonists had disappeared. The settlement was abandoned. The only clue White found was the word "CROATOAN" carved into a tree.<ref name="tlcrn">{{Cite web|last=thatgirlproductions.net|title=The Roanoke Voyages|url=http://thelostcolony.org/education/Students/History/TheRoanokeVoyages.htm|publisher=thelostcolony.org|accessdate=23 July 2010}}</ref><ref name="bbrc">{{Cite book|last=Belval|first=Brian|title=A Primary Source History of the Lost Colony of Roanoke|year=2006|publisher=Rosen Classroom|isbn=1-4042-0669-8|page=4}}</ref>  Before leaving the colony three years earlier, White had left instructions that, if the colonists left the settlement, they were to carve the name of their destination, with a [[Maltese cross]] if they left due to danger.<ref>Beers Quinn. David, Ed. ''The Roanoke Voyages 1584-90''. Vol. 1-11. Hakluyt Society, 1955. p.615</ref>

"CROATOAN" was the name of an island to the south (modern-day [[Hatteras Island]]), where a native tribe friendly to the English was known to live. Colonists might have tried to reach that island.  However, foul weather kept White from venturing south to search on Croatoan for the colonists, and he returned to England. White never returned to the New World. Unable to determine exactly what happened, people referred to the abandoned settlement as "The Lost Colony."

The [[Fort Raleigh National Historic Site]] is a reconstruction of the fort built by the English on the island. It was constructed according to archeological evidence and historic texts.

In the book ''A New Voyage to Carolina'' (1709), the explorer [[John Lawson (explorer)|John Lawson]] wrote the following, stating the ruins of lost colony were still visible: 
<blockquote>"The first Discovery and Settlement of this Country was by the Procurement of Sir Walter Raleigh, in Conjunction with some publick-spirited Gentlemen of that Age, under the Protection of Queen Elizabeth; for which Reason it was then named Virginia, being begun on that Part called Ronoak-Island, where the Ruins of a Fort are to be seen at this day, as well as some old English Coins which have been lately found; and a Brass-Gun, a Powder-Horn, and one small Quarter deck-Gun, made of Iron Staves, and hoop'd with the same Metal; which Method of making Guns might very probably be made use of in those Days, for the Convenience of Infant-Colonies."<ref name="Lawson">{{Cite book|last=Lawson|first=John|authorlink=John Lawson (explorer)|title=A New Voyage to Carolina|year=1709|publisher=University of North Carolina Press (1984)|isbn=9780807841266|pages=68<U+2013>69}}</ref></blockquote>

Lawson also claimed the natives on Hatteras island claimed to be descendants of "white people" and had inherited physical markers relating them to Europeans that no other tribe encountered on his journey shared: 
<blockquote>"A farther Confirmation of this we have from the Hatteras Indians, who either then lived on Ronoak-Island, or much frequented it. These tell us, that several of their Ancestors were white People, and could talk in a Book, as we do; the Truth of which is confirm'd by gray Eyes being found frequently amongst these Indians, and no others. They value themselves extremely for their Affinity to the English, and are ready to do them all friendly Offices. It is probable, that this Settlement miscarry'd for want of timely Supplies from England; or thro' the Treachery of the Natives, for we may reasonably suppose that the English were forced to cohabit with them, for Relief and Conversation; and that in process of Time, they conform'd themselves to the Manners of their Indian Relations."<ref name="Lawson" /></blockquote>

===Civil War years===
[[File:BattleofRoanokeIsland.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Roanoke Island showing Rebel forts, c. 1862-1865]]

During the [[American Civil War]], the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] fortified the island with three forts.  The [[Battle of Roanoke Island]] (February 7&ndash;8, 1862) was an incident in the Union North Carolina Expedition of January to July 1862, when Brigadier General [[Ambrose E. Burnside]] landed an [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] force and took Confederate forts on the island.  Afterward, the Union Army retained the three Confederate forts, renaming them for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] generals who had commanded the winning forces:  Huger became Fort Reno; Blanchard became Fort Parke; and Bartow became Fort Foster. After the Confederacy lost the forts, the Confederate [[Secretary of War]], [[Judah P. Benjamin]], resigned. Roanoke Island was occupied by Union forces for the duration of the war, through 1865.

Slaves from the island and the mainland of North Carolina fled to the Union-occupied area with hopes of gaining freedom. By 1863, numerous former slaves were living on the fringe of the Union camp. The Union Army had classified the former slaves as "[[contraband]]s," and determined not to return them to Confederate slaveholders.  The freedmen founded churches in their settlement and started what was likely the first free school for blacks in North Carolina.

[[Horace James]], an experienced [[Congregational]] chaplain, was appointed by the US Army in 1863 as "Superintendent for Negro Affairs in the North Carolina District." He was responsible for the Trent River contraband camp at [[New Bern, North Carolina]], where he was based.  He also was ordered to create a self-sustaining colony at Roanoke Island<ref name="RIFC">[http://www.roanokefreedmenscolony.com/ Click, Patricia C. "The Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony"], The Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony Website, 2001, accessed 9 November  2010</ref>  and thought it had the potential to be a model for a new society in which African Americans would have freedom.<ref name="learnNC">[http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-civilwar/4590 "The Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony"], provided by National Park Service, at North Carolina Digital History: LEARN NC, accessed 11 November 2010</ref> In addition to serving the original residents and recent migrants, the [[Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony]] was to be a refuge for the families of freedmen who enlisted in the Union Army as [[United States Colored Troops]]. By 1864, there were more than 2200 freedmen on the island.<ref name="learnNC"/>

Under James, the freedmen were allocated plots of land per household, and paid for work for the Army. He established a sawmill on the island and a fisheries, and began to market the many highly skilled crafts by freedpeople artisans. James believed the colony was a critical social experiment in free labor and a potential model for resettling freedmen on their own lands. Northern [[missionary]] teachers, mostly women from [[New England]], journeyed to the island to teach reading and writing to both children and adults, who were eager for education. A total of 27 teachers served the island, with a core group of about six.<ref name="learnNC"/>

The colony and Union troops had difficulty with overcrowding, poor sanitation, limited food and disease in its last year. The freedmen had found that the soil was too poor to support subsistence farming for so many people. In late 1865 after the end of the war, the Army dismantled the forts on Roanoke. In 1865, President [[Andrew Johnson]] issued an "Amnesty Proclamation," ordering the return of property by the Union Army to former Confederate landowners.<ref name="RIFC"/> Most of the 100 contraband camps in the South were on former Confederate land. At Roanoke Island, the freedmen had never been given title to their plots, and the land was reverted to previous European-American owners.

Most freedmen chose to leave the island, and the Army arranged for their transportation to towns and counties on the mainland, where they looked for work. By 1867 the Army had abandoned the colony. In 1870 only 300 freedmen were living on the island. Some of their descendants still live there.<ref name="learnNC"/>
