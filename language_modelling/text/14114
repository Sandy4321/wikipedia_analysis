Tommy Sands has hosted ''Country Ceili'', a radio show on ''[[Downtown Radio]]'' in [[Newtownards]] since 1976.<ref name="Answers"/>

In May 2002 he received an [[Honorary degree|Honorary Doctorate]] from The [[University of Nevada, Reno]] for his ''outstanding work as musician and ambassador for peace and understanding''.<ref name="DNA"/>

His song ''There Were Roses'' has been described as "... certainly one of the best songs ever written about the "[[The Troubles|Irish Problem]]"".<ref name="DNA"/> The song recounts how Allan Bell, a [[Protestant]] friend of Sands, was murdered in [[Newry]].  In the aftermath, a group of local Protestants "prowled round the Ryan Road" for a [[Catholic]] to kill in retaliation; ironically, the man they selected, Sean O'Malley, had been a good friend of the Protestant victim and also of Sands.

==Early life and career==
Tommy Sands was born on the family farm on the 'Ryan Road'<ref name="NorIreCult"/> in the [[townland]] of Ryan, near [[Mayobridge]], [[County Down]], [[Northern Ireland]].<ref name="SanFamBio"/> His  parents, Mick and Bridie, both came from families of singers, musicians and storytellers and encouraged a love of Irish culture and tradition in their seven children (Mary, the eldest, then Hugh, Ben, Colum, Eugene and Anne.<ref name="Pride of Mayo"/>) .<ref name="SanFamBio"/> His father Mick (known to all as 'The Chief'<ref name="NorIreCult">[http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=1608 Culture of Northern Ireland, NIMIC Hall of Fame - The Sands Family, Geoff Harden traces the Sands' musical family tree]</ref>) and six uncles played the fiddle. Bridie, an accordionist, is the daughter of 'Burren poet', Owen Connolly, and her mother was related to the [[Bront<U+00EB>]] family.<ref name="BenSands">[http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Sands Ben Sands profile at 'Last FM']</ref> Their [[C<U+00E9>ilidh|C<U+00E9>ilidh house]] on the Ryan Road, in the foothills of the [[Mourne Mountains|Mountains of Mourn]],<ref name="Answers"/> was a focal point for [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] neighbours from nearby farms to enjoy music and [[Craic]].<ref name="SanFamBio"/><ref name="Answers"/> 

''The Sands Family'' (Tommy, Eugene, Ben, Colum and Anne)<ref name="Answers"/> started public performing in local halls and pubs, then they won a 'Folk Group' contest in "Old Shieling Hotel" in [[Raheny]], [[Dublin]]. This led to a three-week booking in [[New York]] in early 1971<ref name="SanFamBio"/> (or 1970<ref name="Answers"/>) followed by further tours in the USA and Canada. They also performed a [[St Patrick's Day]] concert appearance in [[Carnegie Hall]]. 

Sands initially attended college to study theology and philosophy, but 'dropped out' and began to walk the 120 miles home to concentrate on his music career. Along the way a car filled with his siblings picked him up to perform at a concert.<ref name="Answers"/>
{{cquote2|Colum rolled down the window and said: <U+201C>We<U+2019>re going to play at a concert. We<U+2019>ve got your guitar in the back of the car.<U+201D> So Tommy joined them. He and they have never looked back! ('Newry Memoirs - Pride of Mayobridge')<ref name="Pride of Mayo"/>}}

Their 35 year touring career includes regular tours throughout continental Europe, especially Germany, plus the UK, and Ireland.<ref name="SanFamBio"/><ref name="Answers"/> One notable highlight was performing in [[Moscow]]'s [[Luzhniki Stadium|Luzhniki 'Olympic' Stadium]],<ref name="DNA">[http://dnausers.d-n-a.net/tsands/tommy.htm Dna Users, Biography of Tommy Sands]</ref> Tommy was the prime songwriter with the Sands Family, whose repertoire largely consists of their own compositions plus traditional Irish songs.<ref name="SanFamBio"/>

During the 1975 'Sands Family' tour of Germany Tommy's brother Eugene was killed in a road accident,<ref name="Answers"/> 'Dino' played banjo and mandolin.<ref name="NorIreCult"/>

Since the early 2000s the Sands Family have restricted touring to an annual tour of Germany and Ireland.<ref name="Answers"/>

In September 2008 Tommy Sand was invited to perform at the [[Library of Congress]] with his daughter Moya and son Fionan, as part of the ''Rediscover Northern Ireland Program''. The event was co-sponsored by the [[Arts Council of Northern Ireland]] and the [[American Folklife Center]].<ref name="LocalGov">[http://www.loc.gov/today/cyberlc/feature_wdesc.php?rec=4471 Library of Congress - Government Today.
