'''State Route 57''' ('''SR&nbsp;57'''), also known as the '''Orange Freeway''', is a north<U+2013>south [[state highway]] in the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]] of California. It connects the [[interchange (road)|interchange]] of [[Interstate 5 (California)|Interstate 5]] (I-5) and [[California State Route 22|SR 22]] near downtown [[Orange, California|Orange]], locally known as the [[Orange Crush (interchange)|Orange Crush]], to the [[Glendora Curve]] interchange with [[Interstate 210 (California)|I-210]] and [[California State Route 210|SR 210]] in [[Glendora, California|Glendora]]. The highway provides a route across several spurs of the [[Peninsular Ranges]], linking the [[Los Angeles Basin]] with the [[Pomona Valley]] and [[San Gabriel Valley]].

A predecessor to this road ran through [[Brea Canyon]] by the early 20th century and was added to the state highway system. The freeway was built in stages during the 1950s, one of which included the Brea Canyon Freeway; SR&nbsp;57 was designated as part of the [[1964 state highway renumbering (California)|1964 state highway renumbering]]. The final portion of the present-day Orange Freeway was not completed until the early 1970s. The latest piece of SR&nbsp;57 to be added was formerly part of I-210, after SR&nbsp;210 was extended to [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] in 1998. An unconstructed extension from Santa Ana south to [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]] remains in the legal definition of Route 57, and has been studied most recently as a [[toll road]] above the [[Santa Ana River]].

==Route description==
[[Image:Orange Freeway southbound leaving the Kellogg Hill Interchange.jpg|thumb|left|Southbound in [[San Dimas, California|San Dimas]], leaving the [[Kellogg Hill Interchange]]]]

SR&nbsp;57 begins at the [[Orange Crush interchange]] near downtown [[Orange, California|Orange]], where it meets the northwest<U+2013>southeast [[Santa Ana Freeway]] ([[Interstate 5 (California)|I-5]]) and the east<U+2013>west [[Garden Grove Freeway]] (SR&nbsp;22). The Orange Crush interchange, which had long been considered a major [[bottleneck (road)|bottleneck]], was rebuilt in the 1990s and 2000s.<ref>{{cite news|title='Orange Crush' Gets Tighter|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 28, 1992|page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Orange Crush link to shut till Monday|newspaper=[[Orange County Register]]|date=November 18, 2006|location=Santa Ana, California|url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/freeway-46948-project-construction.html}}</ref> The freeway heads north from the junction and soon crosses to the west side of the [[Santa Ana River]], continuing north through suburban portions of [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]] and passing next to [[Angel Stadium of Anaheim|Angel Stadium]] and the [[Honda Center]]. In northern Anaheim, SR&nbsp;57 meets the Riverside Freeway ([[California State Route 91|SR 91]]). SR&nbsp;57 briefly passes through [[Placentia, California|Placentia]] and [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]], providing access to [[California State University Fullerton]]. As it crosses [[Imperial Highway]] ([[California State Route 90|SR 90]]) near the [[Brea Mall]] and enters [[Brea, California|Brea]], SR&nbsp;57 enters more rugged terrain before climbing through Brea Canyon, the gap between the [[Chino Hills]] and [[Puente Hills]]. Near the rim of the canyon, the highway curves north out of the Brea Canyon, and descends slightly to a junction with the [[Pomona Freeway]] ([[California State Route 60|SR 60]]) in [[Diamond Bar, California|Diamond Bar]], right on the edge of the [[San Gabriel Valley]].<ref name=maps>{{cite map|publisher=ACME Maps|title=ACME Mapper 2.0|url=http://mapper.acme.com/?ll=33.88068,-117.85995&z=10&t=M|accessdate=April 8, 2011|cartography=[[Google Maps]]}}</ref>

A short [[overlap (road)|overlap]] carries SR&nbsp;57 traffic on the same roadway as SR&nbsp;60. The two routes head northeast through an arm of the San Gabriel Valley; after they split, SR&nbsp;57 ascends slightly and then slopes through the edge of the Puente Hills and into the west end of the [[Pomona Valley]]. Here it meets the [[San Bernardino Freeway]] ([[Interstate 10 (California)|I-10]]) and [[Chino Valley Freeway]] ([[California State Route 71|SR 71]]) at the four-level [[Kellogg Hill Interchange]]. In the north half of that interchange, SR&nbsp;57 enters the [[San Jose Hills]], climbing to its highest elevation before descending back into the connected San Gabriel and Pomona Valleys and ending at the [[Glendora Curve]] interchange with the [[Foothill Freeway]] ([[Interstate 210 (California)|I-210]]) in [[Glendora, California|Glendora]].<ref name=maps/>

[[High-occupancy vehicle]] (HOV) lanes exist in the [[median (road)|median]] of SR&nbsp;57 south of SR&nbsp;60 in Diamond Bar. Elevated ramps allow HOV traffic bound to or from Brea Canyon to connect with I-5 towards the southeast, SR&nbsp;91 towards the west, or SR&nbsp;60 towards the east without entering the main lanes.<ref name=maps/><ref name=HOV>{{cite web|title=Interregional HOV System Status|url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist07/aboutdist7/hov/hov_maps/HOV_Route_Status_Interregional_06.pdf|author=Staff|publisher=California Department of Transportation|accessdate=April 9, 2011|year=2005<U+2013>2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081008220530/http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist07/aboutdist7/hov/hov_maps/HOV_Route_Status_Interregional_06.pdf|format=PDF|archivedate=May 8, 2008}}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:57-night view in Brea.jpg|thumb|Looking north from Imperial Highway (SR&nbsp;90) in [[Brea, California|Brea]]]]
The road through Brea Canyon was [[oiled dirt]] by the late 1910s, providing a good connection across an outbranching of the [[Peninsular Ranges]] between the [[Los Angeles Basin]] and Pomona Valley. This road left the main coast highway ([[Harbor Boulevard]]) at [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] and followed the present Brea Boulevard and Brea Canyon Road, merging with the [[Valley Boulevard]] from Los Angeles near [[Walnut, California|Walnut]] and continuing east to [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] via Valley and [[Pomona Boulevard]]s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Official Automobile Blue Book Volume Eight|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lskNAAAAYAAJ|page=530|year=1919|publisher=The Automobile Blue Book Publishing Co|author=Staff}}</ref> [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] paved the road in concrete in early 1923,<ref>{{cite news|title=New Road Winds In and Out|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 25, 1923|page=VI8}}</ref> and in 1931 it was added to the state highway system as a branch of [[Legislative Route 19 (California pre-1964)|Route 19]]. Until then, Route&nbsp;19 had connected [[Legislative Route 9 (California pre-1964)|Route 9]] near [[Claremont, California|Claremont]] with [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], following Garey Avenue and [[Mission Boulevard (Southern California)|Mission Boulevard]] through Pomona.<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1931|ch=82|p=103|quote=Pomona to Fullerton via Brea canyon.}}</ref><ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1935|ch=29|p=276|quote=Route&nbsp;19 is from: (a) Route&nbsp;9 west of Claremont to Beaumont via Riverside. (b) Pomona to Fullerton via Brea Canyon.}}</ref>

The state built a bypass of the Valley Boulevard portion of the route in the early-to-mid-1930s, leaving the old road near Diamond Bar and heading northeast through the foothills, along the present freeway alignment and Mission Boulevard.<ref name="rmcn 1933">{{cite map|publisher=[[Rand McNally & Company]]|url=http://members.cox.net/mkpl2/hist/droz-laca33n.jpg|title=Los Angeles & Vicinity|year=1933|accessdate=February 13, 2008}}</ref> To the south, the legislature added then-unrelated Route&nbsp;180 along State College Boulevard in 1933, connecting [[Legislative Route 2 (California pre-1964)|Route 2]] (I-5) near the Santa Ana River with [[Legislative Route 175 (California pre-1964)|Route 175]] (Orangethorpe Avenue, later replaced by [[SR 91 (CA)|SR 91]]) near Placentia.<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1933|ch=767|p=2040|quote=State&nbsp;Highway&nbsp;Route&nbsp;2 near Orange County Hospital northerly to Hermosa Beach-Santa Ana Canyon Road.}}</ref><ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1935|ch=29|p=286|quote=Route&nbsp;180 is from Route&nbsp;2 near Orange County Hospital northerly to Route&nbsp;175.}}</ref> By 1955, the Brea Canyon Freeway was proposed to begin at the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) near La Veta Avenue in [[Santa Ana, CA|Santa Ana]] and head north, paralleling Routes 180 and 19 to<!--and beyond?--> Pomona.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brea Canyon Freeway Plan Pushed|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 16, 1955|page=13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Propose Four New Routes for Freeways|newspaper=[[Valley News (Van Nuys)|Valley News]]|location=Van Nuys, California|date=November 2, 1955}}</ref><ref>{{Cite map|publisher=[[Los Angeles Metropolitan Traffic Association]]|url=http://cahighways.org/maps/1956-la-lamta.jpg|title=Proposed Freeway System for the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area|year=1956|accessdate=February 13, 2008}}</ref> The portion northeast of [[Diamond Bar, CA|Diamond Bar]] into Pomona soon became part of the planned Pomona Freeway, and the name of the remainder was changed to Orange Freeway.<ref name=MTEB-1958>{{cite map|format=PDF|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Engineering Board]]|author=Staff|url=http://cahighways.org/maps/1956-la-mteb2.pdf|title=Master Plan of Freeways and Expressways|date=February 28, 1958}}</ref> The state legislature altered the definition of Route&nbsp;19 to reflect this in 1957 by moving its south end to Santa Ana.<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1957|ch=1911|p=3342|quote=Route&nbsp;19 is from:...(b) Pomona to Route&nbsp;2 near Santa Ana.}}</ref>

Then, in 1957, the northernmost part of present SR&nbsp;57 was added to the state highway system as part of [[Legislative Route 240 (California pre-1964)|Route 240]], which the legislature designated along the route planned for I-210.<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1957|ch=24|p=578|quote=Route&nbsp;240 is hereby added to the State Highway System, to extend from Route&nbsp;4 near Glendale to Route&nbsp;26 near the east boundary of Los Angeles County...}}</ref> This became part of the proposed [[Temescal Freeway]], later the [[Corona Freeway]]; a southerly extension of the Orange Freeway<ref name=MTEB-1958/> to [[Legislative Route 60 (California pre-1964)|Legislative Route 60]] ([[California State Route 1|SR 1]]) near [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]] was added in 1959 as Route&nbsp;273.

The southerly extension to Huntington Beach remains unconstructed. In 1986, Orange County's plans were for a toll road elevated above the Santa Ana River rather than through existing neighborhoods, only extending south to the [[Interstate 405 (California)|San Diego Freeway]] (I-405) in [[Costa Mesa, California|Costa Mesa]] with connections to the [[Corona del Mar Freeway]] ([[California State Route 73|SR 73]]); this was largely inspired by congestion on [[SR 55 (CA)|SR 55]] through the Santa Ana area.<ref>{{cite news|first=Kim|last=Murphy |title=Interest Growing in 2 Traffic Proposals for Santa Ana Area|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 7, 1986|page=1|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-07/local/me-13912_1_santa-ana}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Jeffrey A.|last=Perlman |title=Hundreds Cheer as Panel Turns Down [Garden Grove] Freeway Extension|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 29, 1986|page=1}}</ref> The extension was most recently considered by Caltrans as two 11.2-mile-long (18.0&nbsp;km), two-lane [[viaduct]]s that would cost $950 million. The toll road [[Government-granted monopoly|franchise]] that [[American Transportation Development]] (ATD) held for this portion of SR 57 expired in January&nbsp;2001, after a request to delay the expiration until January&nbsp;2007. Following this, ATD sued to restore the franchise, and this case lasted until November&nbsp;2003.<ref>{{cite web|title=Private Investment / Public Infrastructure: Route 57 (Orange County)|url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/paffairs/about/toll/rt57.htm|publisher=California Department of Transportation|accessdate=February 2008}}</ref> The termination was due to ATD not beginning the construction during the first ten years of the franchise, after it had been enacted by the state legislature.<ref>{{cite news|title=Orange County; Road Study Decision Is Delayed|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/25/local/me-57study25|accessdate=February 11, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 25, 2003|page=B3}}</ref>
