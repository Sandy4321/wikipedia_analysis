'''[[Telugu language]] policy''' is an issue within the state of [[Andhra Pradesh]], where it is the [[first language]] of 85% of the population. Telugu language advocates note a lack of incentivisation and government support for the language, and press for their [[linguistic rights]] for Telugu's greater recognition and promotion through government mechanisms.

==Present status==
Telugu teaching as a subject in the primary, secondary and colleges education is not compulsory. The medium of education need not be Telugu in primary and secondary school education. This lax language policy is encouraging English medium schools. Educated Telugu people are slowly losing capability of reading and writing in Telugu in the era of internet. In some English medium schools, speaking in Telugu with fellow students is meted out with corporal punishment by the school teachers.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-09/hyderabad/31139041_1_telugu-caned-girl|title= Girl caned for speaking Telugu in school |date=9-3-2012|accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref>

Telugu [[List of newspapers in India by readership|news papers]] and periodicals are very popular compared to English papers and periodicals in the ratio of 10:1. Hardly 10% of English educated people can comfortably read English newspapers and understand comprehensively.

There are nearly 60 number [[List of Telugu-language television channels|Telugu TV channels]] covering issues and social needs of worldwide Telugu people. However, there is no English TV channel particularly aimed at Telugu or Andhra Pradesh people. There are few national level dedicated English TV channels in India and many international English channels whose viewer ship is less than 2% among Telugu people or all Indians. Few international TV channels such as Discovery, National Geography, etc. in Telugu are also available in Andhra Pradesh.

Most of the correspondence in state & central government offices and private establishments is in English even though the majority employees are Telugu people. Though software tools in Telugu are available in the market, English versions are used invariably in state government offices and educational institutions. All the proceedings in the courts and judgments are in English in Andhra Pradesh.

[[UNESCO]] has warned that Telugu language would become dead language in next 15 years if the present policy of discouragement is continued. The encouragement to English over Telugu has multiplied due to vested interests of private educational institutes and the pseudo cosmopolitan intellectuals swaying complete hold on the machinery of centre and state governments.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-02/india/31116237_1_english-medium-enrolment-district-information-system |title= 2 crore Indian children study in English-medium schools |date=2-3-2012 |accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref>  Due to the multi linguistic nature of India, English protagonists who have risen to prominence during the British rule are able to continue the British education policy even after 65 years of gaining independence in the year 1947.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uproar-in-lok-sabha-over-upsc-issue/article4512025.ece|title= UPSC notification put on hold|date=15-3-2013 |accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref>  A general impression is imbibed in the Indian society for last 30 years that learning English is panacea for the bright future of the people irrespective of good knowledge base in science, maths, arts, history, etc. subjects.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-11-17/edit-page/27994687_1_english-productivity-drive-growth |title= Myths about English|year=2007|accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref> 

Many educated Telugu people started visiting and residing in all parts of the world in search of knowledge based jobs. They are able to give their first hand credible observations and feed back to all sections of Telugu people that how, many countries are able to prosper faster than India by imparting education in their native languages without depending on English language.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.scribd.com/doc/59102522/Plan-to-Develop-Telugu-Language |title= Plan to develop Telugu language |date=November 2007|accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref>  All over India native language renaissance is picking up gradually demanding for their usage in place of English.

The evolution of English as the present day undisputed only one international language from an underdeveloped and un-preferred language in UK itself during the medial period, is an exemplary case of English people<U+2019>s love, dedication and the untiring efforts towards their language development.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.scribd.com/doc/59102499/%E0%B0%86%E0%B0%82%E0%B0%97%E0%B1%8D%E0%B0%B2-%E0%B0%AD%E0%B0%BE%E0%B0%B7-%E0%B0%AA%E0%B1%81%E0%B0%B0%E0%B1%8B%E0%B0%97%E0%B0%A4%E0%B0%BF%E0%B0%A8%E0%B0%A8%E0%B1%81%E0%B0%95%E0%B0%B0%E0%B0%BF%E0%B0%A6%E0%B1%8D%E0%B0%A6%E0%B0%BE%E0%B0%82|title= <U+0C06><U+0C02><U+0C17><U+0C4D><U+0C32> <U+0C2D><U+0C3E><U+0C37> <U+0C2A><U+0C41><U+0C30><U+0C4B><U+0C17><U+0C24><U+0C3F><U+0C28><U+0C28><U+0C41><U+0C15><U+0C30><U+0C3F><U+0C26><U+0C4D><U+0C26><U+0C3E><U+0C02> (Let us emulate English language progress) |date=in Telugu|accessdate=17 February 2013}}</ref>  It is also interesting to note that how, English (UK) people encourage their minority language Welsh though their native language English has attained status of international language. The present status of [[Welsh language]] in UK which is mother tongue of nearly 0.7 million people only, is far better than the present status of Telugu which is mother tongue of 85 million people in [[India]].

==Mahatma Gandhi's preachings on medium of education==
Throughout his life, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] is very strong votary of education in the mother tongue of the people. The trauma faced by him  in undergoing education through English medium is typical to most of Indians even today.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.mkgandhi.org/towrds_edu/chap14.htm|title= Medium of Instruction, Gandhi Research Foundation |accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref> The following are the few famous quotations by Mahatma Gandhi urging education must be imparted in provincial languages.

* <U+201C>If I had the powers of a despot, I would today stop the tuition of our boys and girls through a foreign medium, and require all the teachers and professors on pain of dismissal to introduce the change forthwith. I would not wait for the preparation of text-books. They will follow the change. It is an evil that needs a summary remedy.<U+201D>        '''Young India, 1-9-1921'''

* <U+201C>The medium of instruction should be altered at once and at any cost, the provincial languages being given their rightful place. I would prefer temporary chaos in higher education to the criminal waste that is daily accumulating<U+2026>.<U+201D>    '''Harijan, 9-7-1938'''

* <U+201C>I must cling to my mother tongue as to my mother's breast, in spite of its shortcomings. It alone can give me the life-giving milk.<U+201D>      '''Harijan, 25-8-1946'''

==Telugu promotion==
During the year 2012, the Andhra Pradesh official language commission has revived its activities. It was assigned the task of organizing fourth [[World Telugu Conference]] (WTC) after a gap of 22 years. WTC was conducted successfully with 5000 Telugu delegates from all parts of the world in [[Tirupati (city)|Tirupati]] city during the last week of December 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.newswala.com/Hyderabad-News/PM-Manmohan-Singh-lauds-Telugu-people-26582.html|title= PM Manmohan Singh lauds Telugu people|date=29 December 2012|accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref>  The conference was inaugurated by president of India.
