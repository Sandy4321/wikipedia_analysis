"'''Performance Review'''" is the eighth episode of the [[The Office (U.S. season 2)|second season]] of the American [[comedy]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', and the show's fourteenth episode overall. It was written by [[Larry Wilmore]] and directed by [[Paul Feig]]. It first aired on November 15, 2005 on the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC). The episode guest stars [[Melora Hardin]] as [[Jan Levinson]].

The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) conducts job performance reviews with his employees, and struggles to get [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]])  to talk about their romantic relationship from the [[The Client (The Office)|previous episode]]. Meanwhile, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) and [[Pam Beesley]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) trick [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) into thinking that it is Friday, when it is in fact Thursday.

The episode was originally going to be about "weight loss" and be one of the very first episodes of the second season. Several scenes were created due to onset accidents and ad-libbing, such as Dwight's fitness orb popping and Michael grabbing Jan's breast accidentally. "Performance Review" contained several pop culture references. It received mostly positive reviews from critics and earned a [[Nielsen rating]] of 3.9 in the 18<U+2013>49 demographic, being viewed by 8 million viewers.

==Plot==
<!-- Per Wikipedia "television episode" guidelines [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:EPISODE#Plot_summaries], the summary should not exceed ten words per minute of screen time. This is a 20-minute episode, so the limit is 200 words. -->
[[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) meets with each of his employees to discuss their job performance. He plunders the employee suggestion box for ideas to impress his own boss, [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]), but the ruse backfires and he embarrasses himself. Michael relentlessly pesters Jan about their previous romantic connection but she bluntly rejects him, especially when, during the office's suggestion box meeting, she discovers that everyone in the Scranton branch is aware of the incident. As Jan storms out of the office, she admonishes Michael before complimenting him and reluctantly stating that she is not ready for a relationship. Meanwhile, the stunned staff listens in.

Meanwhile [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) attempts to have a successful performance review in order to get a raise. He makes elaborate posters, prepares a ridiculous speech, and pumps himself up in the office's hallway. Unfortunately for him, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) and [[Pam Beesley]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) successfully prank him by making him believe that it is a Friday instead of a Thursday. He arrives at the office very late the next day, much to Michael's annoyance.

"Diversity Day" [Commentary track], ''The Office'' Season One (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Universal Studios|Universal]].</ref> The episode was originally going to be about "weight loss" and be one of the very first episodes of the second season aired. However, after "[[The Dundies]]" and "[[The Fire (The Office)|The Fire]]", series creator and developer [[Greg Daniels]] decided to hold the episode off and combine it with elements of "[[The Client (The Office)|The Client]]".<ref name="larry"/> When "Performance Review" was being formulated, Wilmore had "four different ideas that were scrunched together to make an episode".<ref name="larry"/> One of the ideas was on a card that said "Thursday Friday". After inquiring about the meaning, Wilmore loved the idea and noted that it "would be great" in the episode and a "real funny thing to pull on Dwight".<ref name="larry"/> Originally, the episode contained a subplot wherein Pam attempts to get a new chair approved by Michael. The scenes, in fact, were shot, but were never aired.<ref name="wilson"/>

===Filming===
The episode was directed by [[Paul Feig]], making it his third episode directed for ''The Office'' after "[[Office Olympics]]" and "[[Halloween (The Office)|Halloween]]".<ref name="officeolympics">{{cite episode  |title=Office Olympics  |series=The Office |serieslink=The Office (U.S. TV series) |writers=[[Michael Schur]] (writer)|credits= [[Paul Feig]] (director) |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=October 4, 2005 |season=2 |seriesno=3}}</ref><ref name="halloween">{{cite episode |title=Halloween  |series=The Office |serieslink=The Office (U.S. TV series) |writers=[[Greg Daniels]] (writer)|credits= [[Paul Feig]] (director) |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=October 18, 2005 |season=2 |seriesno=5}}</ref> During the filming of the episode, Jenna Fischer came down with a cold.

Several scenes were created due to onset accidents and ad-libbing. In the cold opening, Dwight tries to impress Jim with his recently purchased "[[Exercise ball|fitness orb]]". Initially dismissive, Jim pops the ball after Dwight becomes increasingly obnoxious and troublesome. Before filming, the scene had been successfully rehearsed "about ten times"; each time, when Krasinski punctured the plastic, the ball slowly deflated.<ref name="larry">Wilmore, Larry (Writer). 2006.

Originally, he was supposed to pat Hardin's shoulder. Instead, however, he accidentally brushed past her breast. Hardin, finding the accident "hilarious", demanded that Carell do it during the actual shooting.<ref name="melora">Hardin, Melora (Writer). 2006. "Performance Review" [Commentary track], ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Universal Studios|Universal]].</ref> Furthermore, several of the scenes were improvised beyond the initial lines given to Steve Carell and Melora Hardin, such as the ending wherein Michael and Jan have a discussion about Michael's flaws.<ref name="larry"/> Wilson recounts that he had to sit at his desk for "an hour and a half" due to the ad libbing.<ref name=wilson/>

During the suggestion box scene, Larry Wilmore envisioned Dwight as a [[Ed McMahon]]-type character, repeating everything Michael said.<ref name="larry"/> [[Paul Lieberstein]] claimed that figuring out the logistics for the conference room scene was "the heart" of the episode.<ref name="paul">Lieberstein, Paul (Writer). 2006.

After inquiring who this mysterious Tom is, Phyllis tells Michael that he worked in accounting several years ago and committed suicide. Wilmore claimed during the DVD commentary for the episode that the writers would be bringing him back in the show's [[The Office (season 3)|third season]], in which his backstory would be explained, although this never panned out.<ref name="larry"/> However, during the Writer's Block Q&A session at The Office Convention in 2007, the writers, perhaps sardonically, suggested that Tom's death was the reason that Ryan was brought in as a temporary worker.<ref name="Convention">{{cite interview |last           = The Office Cast|first          =  |title          = The Office Convention 2007 Cast Q&A |year           = 2007| location = ''The Office: Overtime'' | publisher = [[NBC]]}}</ref> Tom's name is briefly seen on Dwight's organization chart in the [[The Office (season 4)|fourth season]] episode "[[Did I Stutter]]", where his name is revealed to be Tom Peets.<ref name="DVD">{{cite DVD-notes |title=The Office: The Complete Fourth Season |titlelink=The Office (season 4) |titleyear=2007<U+2013>08 |director=[[Greg Daniels]], et al |format=booklet |publisher=[[NBC]]}} Note: The DVD case's interlay contains a reproduction of Dwight's chart, which features the name "Tom Peets".</ref>

The Season Two DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Michael giving [[Oscar Martinez]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]) his performance review, Dwight giving Jim advice for his performance review, an extension of Dwight psyching himself up in the stairwell, Michael calling Jan's ex-husband and her reaction, and Michael describing the office with a confused metaphor involving organs of the body.<ref>{{cite video |people= |date=2006 |title=Deleted scenes for "Performance Review" | medium=DVD |publisher=[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] |location=''The Office: Season Two'' Disc 2 }}</ref>
