'''Hurricane Kiko''' was one of the strongest [[tropical cyclone]]s to ever make landfall on the eastern coast of the [[Baja California Peninsula]]. The eleventh [[Tropical cyclone#naming|named storm]] of the [[1989 Pacific hurricane season]], Kiko formed out of a large [[mesoscale convective system]] on August&nbsp;25. Slowly tracking northwestward, the storm [[Rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]] into a hurricane early the next day. Strengthening continued until early August&nbsp;27, when Kiko reached its peak intensity with winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h). The storm turned west at this time, and at around 0600&nbsp;UTC, the storm made [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near [[Punta Arena, Mexico|Punta Arena]] on the southern tip of Baja California. The hurricane rapidly weakened into a tropical storm later that day and further into a tropical depression by August&nbsp;28, shortly after entering the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The depression persisted for another day while tracking southward, before being absorbed by nearby Tropical Storm Lorena. Though Kiko made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane, its impact was relatively minor. Press reports indicated that 20 homes were destroyed and numerous highways were flooded by torrential rains.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Kiko 1989 track.png}}
Unlike most other [[Pacific hurricane|eastern Pacific hurricanes]] between 1988 and 1990 that began as [[tropical wave]]s off the western coast of Africa, Hurricane Kiko developed out of a large-scale [[mesoscale convective system]] on August&nbsp;23 on the coast of [[Sonora]].<ref name="TCR1">{{cite web|author=Max Mayfield|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=November 18, 1989|accessdate=May 25, 2009|title=Hurricane Kiko Preliminary Report Page 1|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1989-prelim/kiko/prelim01.gif}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Lixion A.

Shower and [[thunderstorm]] activity was present around an [[Low pressure area|area of low pressure]] the following day; however, insufficient reports from the region hindered the [[National Hurricane Center]]'s (NHC) forecasting ability. By August&nbsp;25, satellite intensity estimates, using the [[Dvorak technique]], indicated that the low had developed into a [[Tropical cyclone#tropical depression|tropical depression]] around 1200&nbsp;UTC, while the storm was located about 115&nbsp;miles (185&nbsp;kilometers) south of [[Mazatlan, Mexico]].<ref name="TCR1"/> Operationally, the system was not declared a tropical depression; instead it was immediately declared Tropical Storm Kiko with winds of 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h).<ref>{{cite web|author=Gil Clark|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=August 25, 1989|accessdate=May 25, 2009|title=Tropical Storm Kiko Advisory One|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1989/kiko/public/tcp2515z.gif}}</ref> Located within an area with little or no steering current, and situated over warm waters and underneath an upper-level low, conditions were near perfect for [[Rapid deepening|rapid intensification]], despite the proximity to land.

==Preparations and impact==
[[File:Kiko1989filledrainblk.png|thumb|right|Rainfall totals from Hurricane Kiko]]
Around 2100&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;25, the [[Government of Mexico]] issued a [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane warning]] for the [[Islas Mar<U+00ED>as]] and areas between the southern border of [[Sonora]] and [[El Dorado, Sinaloa|El Dorado]]. A hurricane watch was also issued for areas between [[Los Burros, Mexico|Los Burros]] and the southern tip of [[Baja California Sur]] along the [[Gulf of California]]. By 0900&nbsp;UTC the following day, the hurricane watch was upgraded to a warning. Roughly three hours later, the previous hurricane watch issued for Sonora was discontinued as Kiko was no longer forecast to make landfall in the state. The hurricane warning on Baja California was also extended northward to [[Bah<U+00ED>a Concepci<U+00F3>n, Mexico|Bah<U+00ED>a Concepci<U+00F3>n]]. Due to uncertainty in Kiko's track, a hurricane watch was re-issued for Sonora between El Dorado and [[Los Mochis, Sinaloa|Los Mochis]]. Around 0900&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;27, a hurricane warning was issued for areas south of San Carlos on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific coast]] of Baja California. The hurricane watch for Sonora was then discontinued. By 1800&nbsp;UTC, the hurricane warnings on the Gulf Coast of Baja California were replaced by a tropical storm warning which was declared for areas between the southern tip of the peninsula and Bah<U+00ED>a Concepci<U+00F3>n. At this time, the hurricane warning for the Pacific coast was revised to a tropical storm warning. Early on August&nbsp;28, all watches and warnings were discontinued as Kiko weakened into a tropical depression and moved  away from land.<ref name="TCR4">{{cite web|author=Max Mayfield|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=November 18, 1989|accessdate=May 25, 2009|title=Hurricane Kiko Preliminary Report Page 4|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1989-prelim/kiko/prelim04.gif}}</ref>
