"'''4-D'''" is the fourth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 9)|ninth season]] and the 186th episode overall of the [[Television in the United States|American]] [[science fiction]] [[television series]] ''[[The X-Files]]''. The episode first aired in the United States on December 9, 2001 on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network. It was written and directed by [[Steven Maeda]] and directed by [[Tony Wharmby]]. The episode is a [[List of Monster-of-the-Week characters in The X-Files|Monster-of-the-Week]] episode, unconnected to the series' wider [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. The episode earned a [[Nielsen rating]] of 5.1 and was viewed by 5.38 million households. It received mixed to positive reviews from critics.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]), [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]), and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. In this episode, a vicious murderer threatens Doggett and Reyes and then vanishes. Doggett is shot and [[Brad Follmer]] ([[Cary Elwes]]) discovers that Reyes' gun was used. Based on the evidence, Reyes concludes that Lukesh can travel between parallel universes in order to kill.

Maeda wrote the episode after being inspired by the situation of a real-life French journalist, [[Jean-Dominique Bauby]], who had been paralyzed and could only communicate by blinking his left eyelid. The character of Lukesh was in part inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and was created by Maeda in the hopes that he would go on to be a memorable villain. Effects expert [[Mat Beck]] created the unique a visual sequence that showed Doggett and Lukesh traveling between the different universes. To create the effect of a parallel universe, every scene in the episode's teaser was flipped so that the mirror image was shown.

==Plot==
[[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]) monitors Erwin Lukesh, a suspected [[serial killer]] who cuts out his victims' tongues. While pursuing him, Reyes goes into an apartment building and is attacked by Lukesh with a razor. [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]), observes the pursuit electronically and hears a scream. He rushes to help Reyes and finds her dying, her throat cut. Doggett chases Lukesh into an alleyway, where the killer seemingly vanishes. Lukesh then appears behind Doggett and fires at him with Reyes' gun.

The setting then changes; Doggett arrives at Reyes' new apartment with a housewarming gift. Neither seems to be aware of the previous events. Reyes than receives a phone call from [[Walter Skinner]] ([[Mitch Pileggi]]), who informs her that Doggett has been shot and is being taken to the hospital. Reyes tells Skinner that Doggett is in her apartment, but then finds him gone. When she arrives at the hospital, Reyes learns that Doggett was shot with her gun. Reyes is questioned by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], insisting that Doggett was with her at the time of the shooting. Meanwhile, Lukesh watches the interrogation and identifies Reyes as the shooter.

Doggett regains consciousness, but is breathing with the help of a respirator.  Meanwhile, Lukesh goes to his apartment where he lives with his disabled mother.  As he prepares to fix her lunch, he goes to his freezer and pulls out a bag containing a human tongue. Reyes performs a background check on Lukesh, and becomes convinced he is in fact responsible for the shooting.  Reyes goes to Doggett, and through a computer setup that enables him to tap out words, Doggett tells her that Lukesh shot him but that Doggett also saw her with her throat cut.

Lukesh then returns to the alleyway where Doggett was shot and vanishes. Based on the contradictory evidence, Reyes concludes that Lukesh can travel between parallel universes in order to kill. She also concludes that the unharmed Doggett disappeared because two versions of the same person cannot exist in one universe. Skinner questions Lukesh, who becomes agitated when his mother is mentioned. Noting this, Skinner decides to hint that his mother will be questioned, which leads Lukesh to become more uncomfortable. Lukesh returns home to find his mother has found the gun with which he shot Doggett. After she threatens to talk to the FBI, Lukesh kills her.

Doggett tells Reyes that to resolve the situation, she must turn off his respirator and allow him to die but she refuses. Suspecting that Lukesh plans to kill Reyes next, Skinner convinces Reyes to go back to her apartment while he, Scully, and Brad Follmer monitor her. She returns and is attacked by Lukesh. The team rush to her aid and Follmer shoots Lukesh in the head, killing him. Reyes then returns to the hospital, closing her eyes as she shuts off Doggett's respirator.  As she opens her eyes, the scene changes back to her apartment at the moment Doggett had disappeared. Reyes, stunned and fighting back tears, embraces Doggett as he, evidently unaware of any of the previous events, asks her what is wrong.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/xfiles/episodeguide/nine/page4.shtml |title=4-D |publisher=[[BBC]]|work=BBC Cult|accessdate=1 October 2009}}</ref>

==Production==
===Writing===
[[File:Hitchcock, Alfred 02.jpg|The episode's villain, Lukesh, was inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1960 film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.|200px|thumb|right]]
[[Steven Maeda]], the writer, had previously written [[The X-Files (season 8)|eighth season]] episodes "[[Redrum (The X-Files)|Redrum]]" and "[[Vienen]]". Due to their success, Maeda was asked to pen a [[List of Monster-of-the-Week characters in The X-Files|stand alone]] episode. His efforts were hampered by the fact that, due to the departure of [[David Duchovny]], the general circumstances of ''The X-Files'' had become more difficult. The plot for "4-D" was inspired by the situation of a real-life French journalist, [[Jean-Dominique Bauby]]. Bauby had been paralyzed and could only communicate by blinking his left eyelid. Maeda wanted to employ that type of aliment in his script, and originally thought of drawing up a guest character for this purpose. However, he eventually felt that the plot would be more successful with a regular character, and decided to utilize Doggett. Maeda decided to employ the theory of [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallell universes]] in order to achieve his desired story as well as to resolve the episode. The character of Lukesh was in part inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1960 film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. Maeda later expressed that he wished to create a villain that would be as memorable as other notable  enemies in ''The X-Files'', such as [[Eugene Victor Tooms]] and [[The Host (The X-Files)|The Flukeman]].<ref name="TCE">{{cite journal|journal=The X-Files: The Collector's Edition|publisher=GE Fabbri|year=2006|volume=45|issn=1747-9096}}</ref>

"4-D" expounded upon the budding relationship between Doggett and Reyes. Most of the two's romantic interactions were limited to "flirtatious undercurrents" because, according to [[Annabeth Gish]], series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] "was never did on the flamboyant big performances."<ref name=bb/> Robert Patrick later claimed that he came up with the scene wherein Reyes takes care of a wounding Doggett, including shaving him. He noted, "I'd read ''[[The Diving Bell and the Butterfly]]'', and I believe there's a part of that in the book where the character gets shaved, and I thought, 'Wow, that's really an intimate kind of moment.'"<ref name=bb>Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 201</ref>

===Effects and cultural references===
Effects expert [[Mat Beck]] was instructed to create a visual sequence that showed Doggett and Lukesh traveling between the different universes.<ref name="TCE"/> Various effects were tested, including characters disappearing into black holes, phasing through the air in a more "exaggerated" and "watery" way, and combinations of both.<ref name="sfx">{{cite video |people=[[Paul Rabwin]] |year=2002 |title=Special Effects by Mat Beck with Commentary by Paul Rabwin: "Passing Through Time Warp" |location= ''[[The X-Files (season 9)|The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season]]'' |medium= DVD |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> Beck ultimately decided to record the actors behind the two characters performing certain actions. He then used software to morph the two together to make it appear as if they had vanished. Later, artistic touches were added in post-production editing to give a more futuristic effect.<ref name="TCE"/>

To create the effect of a parallel universe, every scene in the episode's teaser was flipped so that the mirror image was shown. In order to render words correctly, letters had to be re-written backwards so that they yielded the correct spelling. Monica Reyes' Georgetown apartment address is 67 Bennett Avenue. This is a reference to [[Rod Serling]]'s address in [[Binghamton, New York]]. Furthermore, her apartment number 6, is a reference to [[Patrick McGoohan]]'s number in the 1967 television series, ''[[The Prisoner]].''<ref name=site>{{cite web|title=4-D - Research Information|url=http://www.xfiles.com/episodes/season9/9x04_research.html|work=''XFiles.com''|publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]]|accessdate=14 July 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020410154136/http://www.xfiles.com/episodes/season9/9x04_research.html|archivedate=10 April 2002|date=9 December 2001}}</ref>

Critical reception to the episode was mixed to positive. In a season review, Michelle Kung from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the episode "worthy", but noted that it was overshadowed by the show's "ludicrous conspiracy plots".<ref>{{cite news|last=Kung|first=Michelle|title=The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season|url=http://search.ebscohost.com.www2.lib.ku.edu:2048/login.aspx?direct=true&db=f3h&AN=13288503&site=ehost-live|accessdate=12 July 2012|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=14 May 2004}} {{subscription needed}}</ref> Jessica Morgan from [[Television Without Pity]] gave the episode a B rating. She slightly criticized the episode's resolution, writing that it "explained nothing. I mean, how do these other universes work?"<ref>{{cite web|last=Morgan|first=Jessica|title=4-D|url=http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/the-xfiles/4d.php?page=15|publisher=[[Television Without Pity]]|accessdate=14 July 2012}}</ref> [[Robert Shearman]] and [[Lars Pearson]], in their book ''Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen'', rated the episode four stars out of five. The two noted that, despite the fact that the episode's premise "doesn't seem as well thought through" as Maeda's past efforts, "4-D" is "worth it".<ref name="shear"/> Shearman and Pearson concluded that the episode "earns its strikes by at last restoring to the series a pulse."<ref name="shear"/> Furthermore, they praised Gish's performance, noting that she "finally [is] given a showcase that makes Reyes so much more than a [[New Age]] fanatic".<ref name="shear">Shearman and Pearson, p. 263</ref>

Other reviews were more mixed. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a mixed score and awarded it a 6 out of 10. He wrote, "Overall, this was an episode with a very interesting concept, and it had the virtue of giving us a solid look at Monica Reyes. Hopefully this will win over some of her more vocal critics. But there were little inconsistencies and conveniences that rubbed me the wrong way, and because of that, I cannot say that it was as good as some of the other episodes thus far."<ref>{{cite web|last=Keegan|first=John|title=4-D|url=http://www.entil2001.com/series/x-files/reviews/season9/9-4.html|publisher=Critical Myth|accessdate=14 July 2012}}</ref> In a comparison of "4-D" and the ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'' episode "[[There's More Than One of Everything]]", UGO Networks columnist Alex Zalben wrote that the ''Fringe'' episode won "by a landslide, ["There's More Than One of Everything"] kicked [''Fringe''] into high gear, while '4-D' was ''The X-Files'' winding down."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ugo.com/tv/fringe-versus-x-files?page=2 | title = Fringe vs. The X-Files: Which Does Weird Science Better? | date = 5 April 2010 | accessdate = 18 March 2012 | publisher= [[UGO Networks]] | first = Zalben| last= Alex}}</ref>
