"'''The Springfield Connection'''" is the 23rd episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 6)|sixth season]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and originally aired May 7, 1995.<ref name="richmond" /> After watching [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Snake Jailbird|Snake Jailbird]] cheat [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] out of [[United States dollar|US$]]20 in a [[Three-card Monte]] con game, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] successfully chases Snake and knocks him out with the lid of a garbage can. The experience of foiling a crime exhilarates her, and she decides to join the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] [[Police]]. Marge completes her police training and joins a beat as a [[police officer]]. She becomes disillusioned with her work after witnessing her friends committing [[crime]]s and being exposed to [[police corruption]] and resigns from the force.

The episode was written by [[Jonathan Collier]] with input from [[David Mirkin]], and directed by [[Mark Kirkland]]. The episode's story was inspired by executive producer [[Mike Reiss]]' wife, who had debated becoming a police officer. "The Springfield Connection" drew on influences from the 1980s [[Police procedural|police drama]] ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' and the 1971 film ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', and includes references to ''[[McGruff the Crime Dog]]'' and the theme music to ''[[Star Wars]]''.

Reviews in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and DVD Movie Guide were favorable, and the authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'' cited Marge's [[Police academy|police training]] as the highlight of the episode. Contributors to compilation works analyzing ''The Simpsons'' from [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[culture|cultural]] perspectives have cited and discussed the episode. Marge's experiences in the episode are compared to the character Rita from the stage comedy ''[[Educating Rita]]'' by [[Willy Russell]] in a literary analysis of the play.

==Plot==
[[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], on the way back from an orchestra performance, pass through a seedy part of town. Homer cautions Marge, but gets enticed by [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Snake Jailbird|Snake's]] [[Three-card Monte]] game. Snake cheats Homer out of $20, and when Marge exposes the con, Snake takes off. Marge chases after him and manages to knock him out using a garbage can lid. The incident gives her a sense of exhilaration, and she begins to find that her everyday routine feels dull and boring. In the grocery store, she starts rolling around on her shopping cart until it crashes, exciting her more. Instead of regular [[ham]], she buys [[William Underwood Company|devilled ham]]. She begins to lose interest in her previous magazines and checks out the [[extreme sport|Death Sports]] section. She decides to spice up her life by joining the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] [[Police]] Force. Homer is less than enthused about his wife becoming a cop, but she assures him that he will remain "man of the house". Marge reports for police recruit training and performs well in the various tests. Finally she goes home to her family, and announces herself to be a police officer.

The next day, [[Chief Wiggum]] sends Marge to Junkyville and Bumtown for her beat. On her beat, after encountering [[Lionel Hutz]] rummaging in a [[dumpster diving|dumpster]], she goes to the [[Kwik-E-Mart]], where [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]], who knows the drill, tries to bribe her. On her day off, she orders [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] to wear [[personal protective equipment|safety gear]] when [[skateboard]]ing, which gets him beaten up by the [[bullying|bullies]]. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] tries to encourage her mom to "attack the roots of social problems" but Marge changes the subject with a ''[[McGruff the Crime Dog|McGriff the Crime Dog]]'' [[hand puppet]]. That night, Homer and his friends ([[Lenny and Carl#Lenny Leonard|Lenny]], [[Lenny and Carl#Carl Carlson|Carl]], [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]], [[Barney Gumble|Barney]], and [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Herman|Herman]]) are playing cards. Marge comes in and finds them [[gambling]], which is illegal, and Homer's friends beat a hasty retreat.

The next day, she seems rather unenthusiastic, as everyone seems to be breaking the law - especially Homer, who has [[parking|parked]] illegally and is buying [[distilled beverage|liquor]] for the underage bullies. Marge writes Homer a [[Traffic ticket|ticket]], and when he teases Marge and steals her hat, she [[arrest]]s him. When Homer gets home, he finds his friend Herman involved in a [[jeans|jean]]-[[counterfeit]]ing operation going on in his own garage. As Herman and his cronies are about to tune him up, Marge busts in to save the day. As she is cuffing the rest of the crooks, Herman takes Homer [[hostage]] and runs to Bart's [[tree house]], with Marge in hot pursuit. Herman tries to escape using a pair of [[counterfeit|knock-off]] jeans to slide down a rope, but he falls to the ground. Later, Wiggum informs Marge that they can not hold him due to lack of [[evidence]]. Homer retorts saying that there is a garage full of counterfeit jeans. However, Wiggum says that they have "mysteriously disappeared" - true, considering all the cops are wearing them now. Marge gets mad and says that there is too much [[police corruption|corruption]] on the force and she quits. After a hearty laugh, Wiggum accepts her [[resignation]].

==Production==
"The Springfield Connection" was written by Jonathan Collier and directed by [[Mark Kirkland]].<ref name="Mirkin">Mirkin, David. (2005). Commentary for "The Springfield Connection", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> According to Collier, the inspiration for the episode was former ''Simpsons'' executive producer [[Mike Reiss]]' wife. At one point, she had seriously decided that she wanted to become a police officer but it did not happen.<ref name="Collier">Collier, Jonathan. (2005). Commentary for "The Springfield Connection", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The joke where the police officers laugh at Marge for a long time was pitched by David Mirkin and features a "crazy twist" at the end where Wiggum says "welcome aboard." Mirkin liked the joke so much that he repeated it again at the end of the episode.<ref name="Mirkin"/> Marge uses a "McGriff the crime dog" hand puppet who says "Help me bite crime".<ref>{{cite book | last =Choron | first =Sandra  | title =Planet Dog: A Doglopedia | publisher =Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | year =2005 | page =57 | isbn =0-618-51752-9 }}</ref> The hand puppet is a homage to [[McGruff the Crime Dog]] &ndash; the producers had wanted to use the real McGruff, but could not get permission to use the character.<ref name="Mirkin"/> The idea to have a counterfeit jeans ring was pitched because at the time there had been an explosion in the jeans market, and David Mirkin thought it was right to satirize it.<ref name="Mirkin"/>

When the Korean animators were animating the sequence with Marge in the gun training course, they did not know how to correctly animate the "shell com[ing] out of the gun" because guns were illegal in Korea. They had to consult with the American animators, who advised them to watch movies so they could properly animate the guns.<ref name="Kirkland">Kirkland, Mark. (2005). Commentary for "The Springfield Connection", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The original design for Marge's police uniform had Marge's hair standing up (as it normally is) with the hat on top. Director Mark Kirkland found that it made for awkward staging in scenes, so they altered the design to have her hair pulled down.<ref name="Kirkland"/> David Mirkin later stated that if the design had been used, he would have asked for it to be changed because they were trying to depict Marge as a serious cop.<ref name="Mirkin"/>

==Cultural references==
The title, as well as Herman's illegal activities, are references to the 1971 film ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]''. The couch gag, a parody of the [[gun barrel sequence]]<ref name="martyn" /> in the [[James Bond]] films shows some similarities to that of [[Gun barrel sequence#1965<U+2013>1967|Sean Connery's own gunbarrel sequences]]. Several references are made to the 1980s police drama ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'': the briefing scene at the police station is similar and the background and end credits music, are parodies of the show's theme.<ref name="martyn" /> Marge appears on an episode of ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'', and McGriff the dog is a reference to ''[[McGruff the Crime Dog]]'', a US police public relations figure.<ref name="martyn" /> Additionally, Marge's training sequences features homages to ''[[Police Academy (film)|Police Academy]]'' (1984) and ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' (1994).<ref name="martyn" /> The Springfield Pops play the theme to the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films at an outdoor venue attended by Homer and Marge, and Homer mistakenly believes that the theme's composer [[John Williams]] is dead, complaining: "Laser effects, mirrored balls&mdash;John Williams must be rolling around in his grave!".<ref name="alberti">{{Harvnb|Alberti|2004|pp=29<U+2013>30}}</ref>

==Analysis==
Kurt M. Koenigsberger analyzes Homer's comments about the Springfield Pops rendition of the ''Star Wars'' theme in Koenigsberger's piece: "Commodity Culture and Its Discontents: Mr. Bennett, Bart Simpson, and the Rhetoric of Modernism" published in the compilation work ''[[Leaving Springfield|Leaving Springfield: The Simpsons and the Possibility of Oppositional Culture]]'' edited by John Alberti.<ref name="alberti" /> Koenigsberger comments: "The joke in this opening scene involves a confusion of high and popular artistic production: Marge treats the Springfield Pops as 'culture' and expects that the usually boorish Homer will need to be drawn into the spectacle."<ref name="alberti" /> However, Koenigsberger notes that Homer actually regards ''Star Wars'' as a "classic", implying that a "classic" work must have a musical composer that is deceased, and be devoid of light-shows or glitter balls.<ref name="alberti" /> Koenigsberger uses this example to discuss Homer's application of "a strategy characteristic of literary modernism".<ref name="alberti" />

In their book ''Educating Rita by Willy Russell'', Rebecca Mahon and Nick Chedra cite Marge's desire to "enter the world" as an example of their topic called "Into the World".<ref name="mahon">{{Harvnb|Mahon|Chedra|2003|pp=109<U+2013>111}}</ref> Mahon and Chedra note: "Comedy and parody are frequently used in the episode in order to convey the frustrations Marge is forced to deal with &mdash; whether these are based around the corruption of her colleagues, the music used on occasion which parodies former police shows, or even the scene where Marge is forced to arrest her husband."<ref name="mahon" /> The authors compare Marge's experiences to those of the character Rita from the stage comedy ''[[Educating Rita]]'' by [[Willy Russell]], commenting that both women later regret the decision to "move into the world".<ref name="mahon" />

In the compilation book ''[[The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer]]'' edited by William Irwin, Mark T. Conard and Aeon J. Skoble, contributors Gerald J. Erion and Joseph A. Zeccardi cite the episode as an example in their piece titled: "Marge's Moral Motivation".<ref name="irwin">{{Harvnb|Irwin|Skoble|Conrad|2001|pp=48<U+2013>49}}</ref> Erion and Zeccardi assert that Marge has "virtuous personality traits" which they compare to [[Aristotle]], commenting: "Whether breaking up a counterfeit jeans ring run out of her garage in "The Springfield Connection," escaping a cult commune in "[[The Joy of Sect]]," or standing up to a Poe-ssessed "[[Treehouse of Horror]]," Marge is rarely short on courage."<ref name="irwin" /> They also note that "..Marge's crime-stopping vigilantism in "The Springfield Connection" and her dangerous escape from the Movementarian commune in "The Joy of Sect" demonstrate that she is genuinely brave, but not foolhardy."<ref name="irwin" />

==Reception==
In its original broadcast, "The Springfield Connection" finished 58th in ratings for the week of May 1<U+2013>7, 1995, with a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 7.9. It was the 4th highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'' and ''[[Melrose Place]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=How they rate|work=St. Petersburg Times|page=15|date=May 12, 1995}}</ref>

Robin Oliver rates the episode "thumbs up" in a review in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', where she says of ''The Simpsons'' series: "this encouragingly funny show knows how to tug at the heartstrings".<ref>{{cite news|last=Oliver|first=Robin|title=Thumbs|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|page =18, Section: The Guide|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=September 25, 1995}}</ref> Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood comment on the episode in their book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'': "..the highlight of this episode has to be Marge's training, especially her sharpshooting on the firing range."<ref name="martyn" /> In a review of the sixth season of ''The Simpsons'', Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide writes that the episode surpasses the quality of the previous "[['Round Springfield]]": "After the dull '<U+2019>Round', Season Six rebounds with the pretty good 'Connection'. I can<U+2019>t quite figure out how Marge stays in such good shape, but her escapades as a cop are funny, and the episode works best when she arrests Homer. I especially like his refusal to remain silent."<ref>{{cite news|last=Jacobson|first= Colin|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season (1994)|work=DVD Movie Guide|publisher=www.dvdmg.com|date=August 15, 2005|url= http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonsix.shtml|accessdate=2008-12-24}}</ref>
