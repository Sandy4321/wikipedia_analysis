'''Byron Brad McCrimmon''' (March 29, 1959 <U+2013> September 7, 2011) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[defenceman]] and coach.  He played over [[List of NHL players with 1000 games played|1,200 games]] in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) for the [[Boston Bruins]], [[Philadelphia Flyers]], [[Calgary Flames]], [[Detroit Red Wings]], [[Hartford Whalers]] and [[Phoenix Coyotes]] between 1979 and 1997.  He achieved his greatest success in Calgary, where he was named a [[NHL All-Star Team|second team All-Star]] in 1987<U+2013>88, played in the [[1988 NHL All-Star Game]] and won the [[NHL Plus-Minus Award|Plus-Minus Award]] with a league leading total of [[plus-minus|+48]]. In 1989, he helped the Flames win their first [[Stanley Cup]] championship. His career plus-minus of +444 is one of the highest totals in NHL history.

McCrimmon turned to coaching following his playing career, serving as an assistant with the [[New York Islanders]] before taking over as head coach of the [[Western Hockey League]]'s [[Saskatoon Blades]] for two seasons between 1998 and 2000. He then returned to the NHL as an assistant, first with the Flames then the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] and finally the Red Wings.  He left the NHL to become the head coach of [[Lokomotiv Yaroslavl]] of the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL) in 2011.  He never coached a regular season game however, as he was killed in the [[2011 Lokomotiv Yaroslavl air disaster|Lokomotiv Yaroslavl air disaster]] along with most of the team after their plane crashed en route to their first game.

McCrimmon and the Flyers became embroiled in a contract dispute prior to the [[1986<U+2013>87 NHL season|1986<U+2013>87 season]].  The two sides were unable to agree on a contract the season before, and an arbitrator was required to resolve the impasse.  The arbitrator sided with the team, setting a contract at the Flyers' offer of [[United States dollar|US$]]165,000 for that season (he asked for $200,000), with an option to extend the deal for 1986<U+2013>87. The Flyers exercised that option, and though he admitted he was under contract for the season, McCrimmon refused to play unless a new deal was reached.  When the two sides were unable to come to an agreement, McCrimmon went home to Saskatchewan as the season began.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-3tkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cH8NAAAAIBAJ&pg=3932,4215926 |title=McCrimmon on skates without his teammates |work=Calgary Herald |date=1986-10-18 |accessdate=2012-04-15 |page=C3}}</ref> The Flyers suspended McCrimmon on September 26, 1986, after he refused to appear in the first exhibition games.

Following the season, general manager [[Bobby Clarke]] refused to sign a new deal with McCrimmon, choosing instead to trade him.

In [[1991<U+2013>92 NHL season|1991<U+2013>92]], McCrimmon was paired with a young [[Nicklas Lidstr<U+00F6>m]].

McCrimmon was paired with some of the best defencemen of his generation.  In addition to Lidstrom and Pronger, he played with [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]rs [[Ray Bourque]], [[Mark Howe]] and [[Paul Coffey]]. He was known as a stay at home defenceman who focused on limiting the opposition's chances.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.torontosun.com/2011/09/17/hundreds-gather-to-pay-tribute-to-mccrimmon |title=Hundreds gather to pay tribute to McCrimmon |work=Toronto Sun |date=2011-09-17 |accessdate=2012-04-27}}</ref>  He played a physical game, often in the "dirty" areas of the ice <U+2013> battling opponents in the corners and in front of the net.

[[Brian Propp]], a teammate of his in Philadelphia, said that he was one of the most underrated defencemen of his time.<ref>{{cite web |last=Seravalli |first=Frank |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/frequentflyers/Is-McCrimmon-HOF-worthy.html |title=Is Brad McCrimmon Hall of Fame worthy? |publisher=Philly.com |date=2011-09-09 |accessdate=2012-04-27}}</ref>
