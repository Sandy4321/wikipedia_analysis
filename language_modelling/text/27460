'''Fred "Steamer" Maxwell''' (May 19, 1890 <U+2013> September 11, 1975) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] amateur [[ice hockey]] player. He played [[Rover (ice hockey)|Rover]] in the days of seven-man hockey at the turn of the 20th century, spending six seasons with the [[Winnipeg Monarchs (senior)|Winnipeg Monarchs]] of the [[Manitoba Hockey Association|Manitoba Hockey League]] (MHL) between 1909 and 1915. Considered one of the top players of his era, he won two Manitoba provincial championships with the Monarchs and was a member of the team that won the 1915 [[Allan Cup]] as Canadian [[senior hockey|senior]] amateur champions. Maxwell spurned multiple offers to turn professional and ultimately quit playing hockey when he learned some of his peers at the senior amateur level were getting paid.

A long-time coach at the senior level, Maxwell led the [[Winnipeg Falcons]] to an Allan Cup championship in 1920; the team went on to win an Olympic Gold medal as Canada's representative in the [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Olympic ice hockey tournament]].  He coached into the 1930s, leading several teams to senior and [[junior hockey|junior]] championships. Maxwell is an honoured member of the [[Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum|Manitoba Sports]] and [[Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame|Hockey]] Halls of Fame and was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1962.

==Playing career==
Quick on his feet, Maxwell's skating ability at [[rover (ice hockey)|rover]] earned him the nickname "Steamer".<ref name="PodnieksPlayers">{{cite book |last=Podnieks |first=Andrew |title=Players: The ultimate A<U+2013>Z guide of everyone who has ever played in the NHL |publisher=Doubleday Canada |year=2003 |location=Toronto |isbn=0-385-25999-9 |page=940}}</ref>  He began his senior career in 1909<U+2013>10, appearing in one game with the [[Winnipeg Monarchs]] of the [[Manitoba Hockey Association|Manitoba Hockey League]] (MHL).

Maxwell scored three goals and two assists for the Monarchs in the 1913<U+2013>14 season as the team won the city and provincial championships.<ref name="OGHHOF" /> By virtue of the title, the team was granted possession of the [[Allan Cup]], emblematic of Canada's national senior-amateur championship. The team initially refused to defend the trophy against a challenge by the [[Kenora Thistles]] after the Cup's trustees ruled [[Dick Irvin]] ineligible.  Facing the possibility of having to play with only six players against Kenora's seven, the Monarchs threatened to default.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wwxkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wnoNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1042,510806 |title=Monarchs centre not allowed to play |work=Calgary Daily Herald |date=1914-03-07 |accessdate=2013-01-09 |page=9}}</ref> The game, held March 11, 1914, was ultimately played <U+2013> with Irvin in the line-up <U+2013> and Maxwell's speed and skating helped lead the Monarchs to a 6<U+2013>2 victory.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xwxkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wnoNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3763%2C914945 |title=Monarchs retain Allan Cup by defeating fast Kenora seven by 6<U+2013>2 |work=Calgary Daily Herald |date=1914-03-12 |accessdate=2013-01-09 |page=8}}</ref> The team was unable to defend the trophy against a second challenge, played two nights later against the [[Regina Victorias]].

The Monarchs repeated as Manitoba provincial champions in 1914<U+2013>15 as Maxwell again scored three goals and two assists during regular league play.<ref name="OGHHOF" /> The team reached the [[1915 Allan Cup]] finals, where they challenged the Saskatchewan champion [[Melville Millionaires]] who held the Cup. Unlike the previous year's single-game contests, the 1915 final was played as a two-game, total-goals series.  Melville defeated Winnipeg by a 4<U+2013>3 score in the first game,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bTNmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eYgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1525,2869295 |title=Melville defeats Monarchs in opening match for Cup |work=Vancouver Sun |Date=1915-03-11 |accessdate=2013-01-09 |page=6}}</ref> but the Monarchs overcame a two-goal deficit in the second match to win 4<U+2013>2 and win the series on an aggregate total of six to five.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bzNmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eYgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2930%2C2969025 |title=Monarchs regain Allan Cup after sensational contest |work=Vancouver Sun |date=1915-03-13 |accessdate=2013-01-09 |page=6}}</ref> There were no further challenges, and Maxwell and the Monarchs ended the season as Allan Cup champions.<ref name="OGHHOF" />

Throughout his playing career, Maxwell received several offers to turn professional.  the [[National Hockey Association]]'s [[Toronto Blueshirts]] offered him $1,500 to join their team, while representatives of the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] made an offer of $1,800 the following season.  He turned both offers down, preferring to remain an amateur.<ref name="LOH" /> His feelings on what constituted an amateur player were so strong that he quit playing hockey following the 1915 Allan Cup as the nature of the senior game at the time failed to meet his expectations: "When I played, I bought my own skates and boots. When I found out some of the others were getting paid, I quit."<ref name="TrueAmateur">{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=idNUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KDwNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5256,356460 |title=Steamer Maxwell the true amateur |work=Regina Leader-Post |date=1963-01-03 |accessdate=2013-01-09 |page=24}}</ref>
