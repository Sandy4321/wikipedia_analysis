"'''Fairest of Them All'''" is a [[Star Trek fandom|fan produced]] ''[[Star Trek]]'' episode released in 2014, the third in the [[web series]] ''[[Star Trek Continues]]'', which aims to continue the episodes of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' replicating their visual and storytelling style.<ref name="cnetinterview" /> It was written by [[James Kerwin]] and [[Vic Mignogna]] from a story by Vic Mignogna and directed by James Kerwin. ''Fairest of Them All'' is a direct continuation of the original ''Star Trek'' episode "[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]".

In this episode the [[Mirror Universe (Star Trek)|alternate reality]] Spock confronts his captain Kirk to set a more peaceful course for the troubled and belligerent Terran Empire.

==Plot summary==

In the mirror universe, Kirk urges Spock to take command of the ISS Enterprise, spare the Halkans, and find a way to make peace. He and his landing party are then transported back to the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] universe, while their counterparts return in the alternate reality.

The evil Kirk, now in command again, is determined to take the [[dilithium (Star Trek)|dilithium]] crystals from the Halkans or to destroy them as an example of what happens to those who dare to resist the Terran Empire. The Halkans are not willing to hand over the crystals and Kirk orders a [[Weapons_in_Star_Trek#Photon_torpedo|torpedo]] barrage on their planet, rejecting a diplomatic solution recommended by Spock. The pitiless attack completely wipes out the Halkan civilization but also destroys the dilithium crystals on the planet. Spock points out that the loss of the crystals would not have happened if the Captain had followed his advice. Facing an unexpected and firm criticism by his first officer, a visibly nervous Kirk leaves the bridge and reaches his quarters.

Meanwhile, three Andorians vessels have witnessed the reckless attack to the Halkans and have communicated to the Enterprise that they no more recognize the authority of the Terran Empire, formalizing the start of a revolution. Spock informs the Captain of the Andorian vessels but when Kirk orders him to destroy the ships if they try any aggressive move, Spock refuses to comply. Kirk reacts to the act of insubordination activating the Tantalus Field, a deadly device concealed in Kirk's quarters, to kill Spock. Unexpectedly, the machine does not seem to work. The Captain then calls his private guards and they head to the bridge to arrest Spock.

Spock, in the meantime, has left the bridge and has convinced Scotty to join the (now explicit) mutiny. They take possession of the auxiliary control room, from where they have full control of the navigation of the ship. Other crew members, sent by Kirk to eliminate Spock, are appealed by the peaceful philosophy promoted by the Vulcan and they join the mutiny as well. Marlena reveals to Spock that she was responsible for disabling the Tantalus Field when Kirk tried to kill the fist officer but that the device could be used now to eliminate Kirk. Spock rejects the suggestion, replying that no revolution can succeed using the same methods applied by the previous one.

The more the time passes, the more Kirk is abandoned by his crew and feels helpless, to the point that the Captain asks Spock to meet at the officer's lounge, to discuss the matter in a civil way and to find a compromise. Spock accepts the invitation, well aware that the it could hide a trap. When the two men are facing each other, Kirk tries to shoot Spock but the Vulcan reveals to the Captain that all the weapons have been precautionarily disabled through a dampening field. Kirk, enraged for failing the attempt, attacks the Vulcan and during a pause in the fight shouts his thoughts about the crew, stating that they are just expendables pawns to reach his goals. Unbeknownst to him, his statements have been broadcasted to the entire ship by Spock, showing to the crew the real nature of their leader. Two guards then enter the officer's lounge and, to Kirk's surprise, arrest him.

Spock gives a [[Shuttlecraft (Star Trek)#Star Trek: The Original Series|shuttlecraft]] to Kirk and to the few crew members still loyal to him, so that they can reach the nearest habitable system. In the last exchange of views between them, Spock states that he's aware of the fact that the entire Terran fleet will try to stop the Enterprise and Spock's attempts to build a more peaceful Empire, but that he must try. In the last scene, Spock takes command of the bridge as Captain and gives to the navigator the order to move "forward".

The reviews of ''Fairest of Them All'' have been very positive.

In that regard, I'd give this episode a strong thumbs up."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Birmingham|first1=John|title=Review of Star Trek Continues Ep : Fairest of Them All|url=http://cheeseburgergothic.com/show/5955|website=Cheeseburger Gothic|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>

More than one reviewer praised the performance of [[Todd Haberkorn]]. Clive Burrell wrote on ''Some kind of Star Trek'': "Todd Haberkorn is excellent as Spock, charting quite a change in the Mirror universe version of the character from cold, calculating officer to peacemaker in 40 minutes"<ref name="somekind">{{cite web|last1=Burrel|first1=Clive|title=Third Time's a Charm: Star Trek Continues: Fairest of Them All|url=http://trekclivos79.blogspot.com/2014/06/third-times-charm-star-trek-continues.html|website=Some Kind of Star Trek|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref> and Josh Edelglass wrote: "Todd Haberkorn gets a real showcase as Mr. Spock in this episode, and he's great.  He's a little stiff in that opening scene in the transporter room, but after that I think he turns in a stellar performance."<ref name="motion" />

Both ''Slice of SciFi'' and ''Some Kind of Star Trek'' commented also on the strong resemblance between Asia DeMarcos and [[BarBara Luna]], the actress who portrayed the character Marlena Moreau in "Mirror, Mirror".<ref name="sliceofscifi" /><ref name="somekind" />
