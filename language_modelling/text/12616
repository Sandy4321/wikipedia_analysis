'''Emery Molyneux''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8><U+025B>m(<U+0259>)ri <U+02C8>m<U+0251>l<U+0259>no<U+028A>}}, ''[[Help:Pronunciation respelling key|EM-(<U+0259>-)ree MO-l<U+0259>-noe]]'') (died June 1598) was an [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] maker of [[globe]]s, mathematical instruments and [[Weapon|ordnance]]. His terrestrial and celestial globes, first published in 1592, were the first to be made in [[England]] and the first to be made by an Englishman.

Molyneux was known as a [[mathematician]] and maker of mathematical instruments such as [[compass]]es and [[hourglass]]es. He became acquainted with many prominent men of the day, including the writer [[Richard Hakluyt]] and the mathematicians Robert Hues and Edward Wright. He also knew the explorers [[Thomas Cavendish]], [[Francis Drake]], [[Walter Raleigh]] and [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]]. Davis probably introduced Molyneux to his own patron, the London merchant William Sanderson, who largely financed the construction of the globes. When completed, the globes were presented to [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Larger globes were acquired by royalty, noblemen and academic institutions, while smaller ones were purchased as practical navigation aids for sailors and students. The globes were the first to be made in such a way that they were unaffected by the humidity at sea, and they came into general use on ships.

Molyneux emigrated to [[Amsterdam]] with his wife in 1596 or 1597. He succeeded in interesting the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]], the parliament of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], in a cannon he had invented, but he died suddenly in June 1598, apparently in poverty. The globe-making industry in England died with him. 

Only six of his globes are believed to be still in existence. Three are in England, of which one pair, consisting of a terrestrial and a celestial globe, is owned by [[Middle Temple]] and displayed in its library, while a terrestrial globe is at [[Petworth House]] in [[Petworth]], [[West Sussex]].

Emery Molyneux is regarded as the maker of the first terrestrial and celestial globes in England and as the first English globe-maker.<ref name="Wallis 1951">A manuscript, MS Harl. 5208, at pp. 50<U+2013>51, which is an account "by a Freind" of William Sanderson's achievements, describes the globes as "the first soe published in Christendome, for the honor of his countrey, and good of the Schollers, Gentrye and Marriners of the same." No earlier English-made globes are known: {{citation|author=Helen M[argaret] Wallis|authorlink=Helen Wallis|title=The first English globe: A recent discovery|journal=[[The Geographical Journal]]|volume=117|year=1951|page=275, n. 1}}.</ref> Little is known about the man himself.

====Terrestrial globes====
In making his terrestrial globes, Molyneux examined ruttiers (instructions for directions at sea)<ref>According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', a ''ruttier'' is "[a] set of instructions for finding one's course at sea; a marine guide to the routes, tides, etc.": {{citation|contribution=ruttier, ''n.''|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50211010|title=OED Online|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=December 2007|accessdate=2008-02-04}}.</ref> and pilots (navigational handbooks).<ref>{{citation|contribution=pilot, ''n.'' and ''adj.''|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50179337|title=OED Online|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=December 2007|accessdate=2008-02-04}}.</ref> He is known to have given a ruttier for Brazil and the West Indies to [[Thomas Harriot]] in 1590.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", pp. 277<U+2013>278.</ref> He also received advice and assistance from navigators and mathematicians.<ref>"Introduction", ''Tractatus de Globis'', p. xii.</ref> It is likely, for instance, that Sir Walter Raleigh advised him on a legend in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] about the [[Solomon Islands]] that appeared on the terrestrial globe.<ref>The legend, which appears in the [[Pacific Ocean]], states: "''Islas estas descubrio Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa por la corona de Castilla y Leon desde el a<U+00F1>o 1568 llamolas Islas de Jesus aunque vulgarmente las llaman Islas de Salomon''" ("Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa discovered these islands and claimed them for the crown of [[Castile and Le<U+00F3>n]]. From 1568 onwards, the islands were named the Jesus Islands, though they are more commonly known as the [[Solomon Islands]]"): "Introduction", ''Tractatus de Globis'', p. xxx.</ref> Raleigh came by the information from [[Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa]], a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] explorer sent by [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II of Spain]] to fortify the [[Strait of Magellan]] after Francis Drake had passed through it. In 1584, the Spaniard was Raleigh's guest in London for a few weeks, after being captured by Raleigh on a journey to Europe.<ref>"Introduction", ''Tractatus de Globis'', p. xxx.</ref>

Molyneux accompanied [[Francis Drake]] on his 1577<U+2013>1580 [[circumnavigation]] of the world; as Ubaldini reported, "[h]e himself has been in those seas and on those coasts in the service of the same Drake".<ref name="Crino & Wallis"/> A legend in [[Latin]] on the terrestrial globe, explaining why Molyneux had left out the [[Polar region|polar lands]] and corrected the distance across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] between [[The Lizard]] and [[Cape Race]] in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], concluded:

On the terrestrial globe, tracks of the voyages of Francis Drake and Thomas Cavendish around the world are marked by red and blue lines respectively. These lines were applied when the globe was first made. They are mentioned in a description of Molyneux's globes in ''Blundeville His Exercises'' (1594)<ref>{{citation|author=Thomas Blundeville|title=M.

Apt|contribution=Wright, Edward (''bap.'' 1561, ''d.'' 1615)|title=[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/30029|accessdate=2008-01-28}}.</ref> assisted Molyneux in plotting coastlines on the terrestrial globe and translated some of the legends into Latin. On [[10 April]] [[1591]], the [[astrologer]] and physician [[Simon Forman]] visited Molyneux's workshop and taught him how to find [[longitude]].<ref name="ODNB"/> It appears that after Molyneux had prepared the manuscript [[Gore (segment)|gores]] (the flat map segments attached to the globes), he had them printed by the celebrated [[Flanders|Flemish]] engraver and cartographer [[Jodocus Hondius]], who lived in London between 1584 and 1593 to escape religious difficulties in Flanders. This can be deduced from the phrase "''Iodocus Hon: / dius Flan. sc. / 1592''" that appears on the celestial globe along with Sanderson's [[coat of arms]] and a dedication to the Queen dated 1592. Molyneux's own name is recorded on the Middle Temple terrestrial globe in the phrase "''Emerius Mulleneux Angl.' / sumptibus Gulielmi&mdash; / Sandersoni Londin<U+0113>: / sis descripsit''" ("Emery Molyneux of England, at the expense of William Sanderson of London, described this").<ref>"Introduction", ''Tractatus de Globis'', p. xxxi. The texts of the inscriptions are from Wallis, "The first English globe", p. 280.</ref>

====Celestial globes====
Molyneux's celestial globe was virtually a copy of [[Gerardus Mercator]]'s globe of 1551, which itself was based on a globe of 1537 by [[Gemma Frisius]] that Mercator had helped to construct.<ref>It has also been stated that Molyneux's celestial globe was based largely on the {{convert|52.5|cm|in|adj=on}} celestial globe made by Dutch globe-maker Jacob Floris van Langren, and that it shows the canonical 48 [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] [[constellation]]s of the [[Southern Hemisphere]] created by the Dutch cartographer [[Petrus Plancius]]: {{citation|author=Susan Doran (ed.)|authorlink=Susan Doran|title=Elizabeth: The Exhibition at the National Maritime Museum|location=London|publisher=[[Chatto and Windus]] in association with the [[National Maritime Museum]]|year=2003|isbn=0701174765|page=134}}.</ref> To the [[constellation]]s featured on Mercator's globe, Molyneux added the [[Crux|Southern Cross]] and [[Triangulum Australe|Southern Triangle]], though somewhat to the west of their true positions. His source appears to have been [[Andrea Corsali]]'s diagram of the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] sky published<ref>In {{citation|author=Giovanni Battista Ramusio (ed.)|title=Primo Volume delle Navigationi et Viaggi nel qual si contiene la descrittione dell'Africa: e del Paese del Prete Ianni, con varii viaggi, dal Mar Rosso <U+00E0> Calicut, et infin all'Isole Molucche ... et la Navigatione attorno il Mondo [First Volume of Navigation and Travels which include the Description of Africa: and of the Lands of Prester John, with Several Travels, from the Red Sea to Calicut and finally to the Moluccan Islands ... and the Navigation Around the World]|location=&#91;[[Veneto]]&#93;|publisher=Gli Heredi di Lucantonio Giunti [The Heirs of Lucantonio Guinti]|year=1550}} ([[Italian language|Italian]]).</ref> in 1550.<ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", pp. 283<U+2013>284.</ref>

Molyneux's globes were the first to be constructed in such a way that they were unaffected by humidity at sea. They were made of flour-paste, an unusual material for the time. Simon Forman remarked that Molyneux's [[Molding (process)|moulding]] or [[casting]] process was "the only way to caste [anything] whatsoever in perfecte forme ... and yt is the perfectest and trewest waie of all wayes ... and this was the wai that Mullenax did use to cast flowere [flour] in the verie forme".<ref>[[Bodleian Library]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Manuscript|MS]] Ashmole 1494, folio 1491.</ref><ref name="ODNB"/>

==Later life==

In the 1590s, Molyneux sought Elizabeth I's patronage for the production of a [[cannon]], which he described as his "new invention, of [[Lead shot|shot]] and [[artillery]], to be used principally in [[naval warfare]]: protection of ports and harbours, a new shot to discharge a thousand [[musket]] shot; with wildfire not to be quenched".<ref>''Calendar of State Papers: Domestic Series'', 1574<U+2013>1580; 1595<U+2013>1597.</ref> In March 1593, Molyneux was issued with a [[Royal Warrant|royal warrant]].  Two years later, the merchant Robert Parkes purchased coal, [[Saltpeter|saltpetre]], [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]], oils and waxes for him, possibly for the cannon. On [[4 November]] [[1596]] the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]]  urged the [[Admiralty|Lord Admiral]]   "to speak to Molyneux, Bussy and the two Engelberts about their offensive engines"<ref>''Calendar of State Papers: Domestic Series'', 1595<U+2013>1597, p. 303.</ref> as part of measures to defend England's south coast. It appears the request was ignored. On [[27 September]] [[1594]],<ref>Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", p. 307.</ref> the Queen granted Molyneux a gift of <U+00A3>200 and an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] of <U+00A3>50. He chose to surrender the latter when, some time between March or April 1596 and [[4 June]] [[1597]],<ref>Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", p. 307.</ref> he and his wife Anne emigrated to [[Amsterdam]], [[Holland]].<ref name="ODNB"/> Wallis has conjectured that he took with him the printing plates for the globes and sold them to Hondius, who had returned to Amsterdam in 1593.<ref>Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", p. 308.</ref>

[[Image:Cannoniere 1652-part.jpg|thumb|left|A diagram of a [[cannon]] from John Roberts' ''The Compleat Cannoniere'' (1652)]]

Why Molyneux left England for Holland is unclear. The ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' suggests it was to be able to personally distribute his globes to European princes, since Amsterdam was then quickly establishing itself as the centre of globe- and map-making.<ref name="ODNB"/> However, this could not have been his intention if he had sold the globes' plates to Hondius. It is possible that he had decided to concentrate on manufacturing ordnance. On [[26 January]] [[1598]], the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States-General]], the parliament of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], showed interest in Molyneux's cannon and granted him a 12-year privilege on an invention. On [[6 June]] he lodged a second application, but he died in Amsterdam almost immediately afterwards. His wife was granted [[Administrator of an estate|administration]] of his [[Estate (law)|estate]] in England later that month. It seems that Molyneux died in poverty, because Anne was granted a Dutch compassionate [[pension]] of 50 [[Dutch guilder|florins]] on [[9 April]] [[1599]]. Molyneux apparently had no surviving family, and the English globe-making industry died with him.<ref name="ODNB"/> No other globes appear to have been manufactured in England until the appearance in the 1670s of globes by [[Robert Morden]] and William Berry, and by [[Joseph Moxon]].<ref>Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", p. 310.</ref> However, over 40&nbsp;years after Molyneux's death, William Sanderson the younger wrote that his globes were "yet in being, great and small ones, Celestiall and Terrestriall, in both our Universities and severall Libraries (here, and beyond Seas)".<ref>Sanderson, ''An Answer to a Scurrilous Pamphlet'', cited in Wallis, "The first English globe", p. 275.</ref>

In the third volume of the greatly expanded version of his book ''The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation'' (1600),<ref>{{citation|author=Richard Hakluyt|title=The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation, Made by Sea or Overland ... at Any Time Within the Compasse of these 1500 [1600] Yeeres, &c.|location=London|publisher=G.

Having, it is believed, purchased the plates of Molyneux's globes, Jodocus Hondius was granted a ten-year privilege on [[1 April]] [[1597]] to make and publish a terrestrial globe. In that year, he produced in Amsterdam a Dutch translation of Hues' ''Tractatus de Globis''.<ref>{{citation|author=Robert Hues|author2=[[Jodocus Hondius|Iudocum Hondium]] (transl.)|title=Tractaet Ofte Hendelinge van het gebruijck der Hemelscher ende Aertscher Globe [Treatise or Instructions for the Use of the Celestial and Terrestrial Globes]|location=Amsterdam|publisher=Cornelis Claesz|year=1597}} ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]). See Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", p. 304.</ref> On [[31 October]] [[1598]], despite a legal challenge by rival globe-maker Jacob van Langeren, Hondius obtained another privilege for ten years.<ref>Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", p. 306.</ref> He duly published globes in 1600 and 1601, and his sons Henricus and Jodocus published a pair in 1613. Hondius also published a world map in 1608 on the Mercator projection. Its reliance on the Molyneux globe is shown by a number of legends, names and outlines which must have been copied directly from it.<ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", p. 277. See also {{citation|author=Brian Hooker|title=New light on Jodocus Hondius' great world Mercator map of 1598|url=http://www.findingnz.co.nz/at/hat2_new_light_j_hondius_world_map_1608.htm|journal=[[The Geographical Journal]]|volume=159|issue=1|date=March 1993|pages=45<U+2013>50|doi:10.2307/3451488}}.</ref>

In his globes of 1612, van Langeren incorporated the improvements made by Hondius the Elder to Molyneux's globe. It is believed that the Hondius globes also spurred [[Willem Blaeu]] to start constructing his large globes in 1616, which were published in 1622. Molyneux's globes therefore may have indirectly influenced the evolution of Dutch globe-making.<ref>Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", pp. 309<U+2013>310.</ref>

===Culture===
The appearance of Molyneux's globes had a significant influence on the culture of his time. In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'', written between 1592 and 1594, one of the [[protagonist]]s, Dromio of Syracuse, compares a kitchen maid to a terrestrial globe: "No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out countries in her."<ref>''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'', Act III, scene ii.</ref> The jest gained its point from the publication of the globes; Shakespeare may even have seen them himself.<ref>Wallis, "Globes in England up to 1660", p. 276.</ref> [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] [[dramatist]] [[Thomas Dekker]] wrote in one of his plays published in ''The Gull's Horn-book'' (1609):<ref name="ODNB"/>

{{quote|What an excellent workman, therefore, were he that could cast the globe of it into a new mould.

It has been suggested that the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], the [[playing company]] that Shakespeare worked for as an actor and playwright for most of his career, named their playing space the [[Globe Theatre]], built in 1599,  as a response to the growing enthusiasm for terrestrial and celestial globes stimulated by those of Molyneux.<ref>{{citation|author=A[dam] M[ax] Cohen|title=Englishing the globe: Molyneux's globes and Shakespeare's theatrical career|journal=The Sixteenth Century Journal|volume=37|issue=4|date=Winter 2006|pages=963<U+2013>984}}.

In ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (1600<U+2013>1601), Shakespeare alluded to the Wright<U+2013>Molyneux Map when Maria says of [[Malvolio]]: "He does smile his face into more lynes, than is in the new Mappe, with the augmentation of the Indies."<ref name="Virginia"/>

==Globes today==
Only six Molyneux globes are known to exist today, two terrestrial globes and four celestial globes. Three celestial globes are in Germany, one each in [[Zerbst]], [[Nuremberg]] (at the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]] (German National Museum)) and [[Kassel]] ([[Hessisches Landesmuseum]] ([[Hesse]] Museum), Kassel). The Hessisches Landesmuseum once had a 1592 terrestrial globe, but it is believed to have been destroyed during [[World War II]]. Three globes remain in England: one pair, consisting of a terrestrial and a celestial globe, is presently owned by [[Middle Temple]] in London and displayed in its library, while a terrestrial globe is at [[Petworth House]] in [[Petworth]], [[West Sussex]].<ref name="Wallis 1952">{{citation|author=Helen M[argaret] Wallis|authorlink=Helen Wallis|title=A newly-discovered Molyneux globe|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=9|year=1952|page=78}}.</ref>

===Petworth House globe===
[[Image:Petworth House, Geograph.jpg|thumb|[[Petworth House]], [[West Sussex]], in 1986]]

A terrestrial globe was discovered in [[Baron Leconfield|Lord Leconfield]]'s library at [[Petworth House]] in [[Petworth]], [[West Sussex]], in July 1949.<ref>For a photograph of the Petworth House globe, see the [http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-108205-features-curators_choice-gallery_picture Curators' Choice photo gallery] on the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] website. Retrieved on [[11 February]] [[2008]].</ref> According to the tradition of the Wyndham family, who are descended from [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy, the 9th Earl of Northumberland]], the globe belonged to Sir Walter Raleigh, who gave it to Northumberland when they were imprisoned together in the [[Tower of London]]. Northumberland, known as the "Wizard Earl" for his interest in scientific and [[Alchemy|alchemical]] experiments and his library,<ref>{{citation|author=David Singmaster|title=BSHM Gazetteer: Petworth, West Sussex|url=http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/bshm/zingaz/P.html#petw|publisher=[[British Society for the History of Mathematics]]|date=[[2003-02-28]]|accessdate=2008-02-07}}.

[[James I of England| James I]]  imprisoned Raleigh in the Tower for his supposed involvement in the [[Main Plot]] .  Although the theory is supported by [[circumstantial evidence]], a number of entries in Northumberland's accounts relating to the mending of globes, one dating back to 1596, suggest that the Molyneux globe may have belonged to him from the beginning and was not Raleigh's.<ref>Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", p. 311; Wallis, "Globes in England up to 1660", p. 276.</ref> The globe, however, almost certainly spent many years in the Tower before its transfer to Petworth House, where Northumberland was confined upon his release in 1621.<ref name="Wallis 1952"/>

The Petworth House globe, presently in the North Gallery, is the only Molyneux terrestrial globe preserved in its original 1592 state. One of Molyneux's "great globes", measuring {{convert|2|ft|1|in|m|abbr=on}} in diameter, it was reported in 1952 to be in poor condition despite restoration by the [[British Museum]] the previous year.<ref name="Wallis 1952"/> The [[northern hemisphere]] was darkened by dirt and badly rubbed in places, to the extent that it was hard to read. Parts of it, and large sections of the [[southern hemisphere]], are missing altogether.<ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", p. 285.</ref> The restoration work revealed that the globe is weighted with sand and made from layers of small pieces of paper overlaid with a coat of [[plaster]] about {{convert|0.125|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick. On top of this is another layer of paper over which the gores are pasted. The globe retains its wooden horizon circle and brass [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] ring, but its hour circle and index are missing.<ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", p. 282.</ref> Further restoration took place between 1995 and 1997.<ref>{{citation|title=Petworth House: Globe|url=http://www.yeoldesussexpages.com/petworth/norgal.htm|publisher=Ye Olde Sussex Pages|accessdate=2008-02-07}}.</ref> The globe was exhibited at the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1951 and 1952.<ref name="Wallis 1952"/>

===Middle Temple globes===

A bill in the accounts of [[11 April]] [[1717]] , for "repairing the globes in the library",<ref name="Middle Temple">"The Molyneux globes", an information sheet distributed by Middle Temple during the Temple Open Weekend on 19 and 20 January 2008.</ref>  is the earliest reference to the Middle Temple's ownership of the Molyneux terrestrial and celestial globes. <ref>For a photograph of the Middle Temple globes, see {{citation|title=Molyneux globes|url=http://www.middletemple.org.uk/Library/Molyneux_Globes.html|publisher=[[Middle Temple]]|year=2006<U+2013>2007|accessdate=2008-02-11}}.</ref> Markham's view was that Robert Ashley (1565<U+2013>1641), a [[Barristers in England and Wales|barrister]] of the Middle Temple who was also an ardent [[geographer]], was likely to have left the globes to the [[Inns of Court|Inn]] in his will, together with his books . Ashley's books formed the nucleus of the Inn's original library and included copies of the second edition of Hues' ''Tractatus de Globis'' and other works on [[cosmography]].<ref>"Introduction", ''Tractatus de Globis'', p. xxxii.</ref> On the other hand, Wallis has said that Markham's view is not supported by any available evidence and the globes are not mentioned in the will. She believes that they were probably acquired by Middle Temple on their publication in 1603.<ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", pp. 287<U+2013>288.</ref>

[[Image:Middle-Temple-Library.jpg|thumb|left|A drawing of Middle Temple Library in 1892 by Herbert Railton]]

The celestial globe is dated 1592, but the terrestrial globe bears the year 1603 and is the only example of its kind.<ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", p. 280.</ref> Wallis has surmised that the globes were made by Hondius in Amsterdam in 1603 for a purchaser in England, perhaps the Middle Temple itself. The celestial globe was made from the original 1592 printing plates, while the terrestrial globe was produced using revised plates redated to 1603.<ref>Wallis, "Globes in England up to 1660", p. 278.</ref> The Middle Temple terrestrial globe differs from the Petworth House globe of 1592 by incorporating Raleigh's discoveries in [[Guyanas|Guiana]]<ref>Probably a reference to [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]] and [[French Guiana]], three countries on the northeast coast of [[South America]].</ref> and adding new place-names in [[Brazil]],  [[Peru]] and [[Africa]], as well as an island marked "[[Korea|Corea]]" off the coast of [[China]] . The most extensive revision altered the [[Northeast Passage]] to take account of discoveries made on [[Willem Barentsz]]'s third voyage to [[Novaya Zemlya]] in 1596. It appears that the revisions to the original plates of Molyneux's globe were completed by 1597, because no discoveries after that year are included.<ref>Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", pp. 304<U+2013>305.</ref> It is possible that Molyneux helped Hondius to update the plates in 1596 or 1597. For instance, if Hondius had obtained a copy of Raleigh's map of Guiana, Molyneux was the most likely source.<ref>Wallis, "Further light on the Molyneux globes", pp. 306, 308.</ref> Unlike the Petworth House globe, the Middle Temple globes are heavily [[varnish]]ed. The varnish could have been first applied as early as 1818 when the globes were repaired by J. and W. Newton; they were certainly varnished by Messrs. Holland Hannen & Cubitts, Ltd. during maintenance work in 1930.<ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", p. 285.</ref>

At the start of World War II, the globes were sent to [[Beaconsfield]] and stored with part of the [[Wallace Collection]] at Hall Barn in the care of [[Baron Burnham|Lady Burnham]]. They were brought back to London in 1945 and were at one stage kept in the [[King's Library]] on loan to the British Museum.<ref name="Wallis 1952"/><ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", p. 276.</ref> The globes were installed in their present position in the Middle Temple Library when the current library building opened in 1958.<ref name="Middle Temple"/> In 2003, they were loaned to the [[National Maritime Museum]] for an exhibition commemorating the life of Elizabeth I.<ref>{{citation|contribution=Molyneux globes|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040419/text/40419w05.htm|title=[[Hansard|House of Lords Hansard]]|volume=660|date=[[2004-04-19]]}}, col.

In 2004, Middle Temple proposed  selling the Molyneux globes, valued at over <U+00A3>1&nbsp;million, to create a scholarship fund for the education and training of needy would-be barristers. Its members eventually decided by a large majority against such a move. There was also a general feeling that the globes should be made more accessible to those wishing to see them.<ref>{{citation|author=Marcel Berlins|title=Words' worth: Pay-per-word?

Photographs of the Middle Temple's Molyneux globes appear on this website.</ref> The project examines the community of mathematicians, [[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]], instrument-makers, and gentlemen-virtuosi that developed around the creation of the Molyneux globes, particularly the histories of four men who wrote treatises about the globes and the larger mathematical community.<ref>{{citation|title=Lesley B.

===Hessisches Landesmuseum globe===
The Molyneux globes at the Hessisches Landesmuseum, Kassel, were inherited from the collection of [[William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|William IV]] (William the Wise), the [[Landgrave]] of [[Hesse-Kassel]],  a pioneer of [[Astronomy|astronomical]] research.  William himself died in 1592, so it has been surmised that his son and successor, [[Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|Maurice]], purchased the globes for the collection. They were first mentioned in 1765 in the index of the Mathematische Kammer (Mathematics Chamber) of the F<U+00FC>rstliches Kunsthaus (Princely Art Gallery) in Kassel, during the reign of Landgrave Frederick III .<ref>Wallis, "The first English globe", p. 288.</ref> Only a celestial globe survives today; it is believed that the terrestrial globe was destroyed during World War II.
