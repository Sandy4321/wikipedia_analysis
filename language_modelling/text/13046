'''Nathaniel Prentice (or Prentiss)<ref>Some sources have incorrectly spelled the middle name of Nathaniel as "Prentiss."  While many military historians spell it "Prentiss", this faulty spelling likely derives from a widely used biographical sketch he did not approve. The general declined to answer requests for biographical sketches, and compilers relying on earlier, faulty sketches apparently repeated this erroneous "Prentiss" spelling. Such a spelling does not appear in other important documents, on his tombstone, or in many letters to him from relatives. There is only one document in the voluminous Banks manuscript collections in which Nathaniel himself spelled his middle name. This was a partially completed fraternity application now at the American Antiquarian Society. He then spelled the name "Prentice".</ref> Banks''' (January 30, 1816<ref>Vital Records of Waltham, Massachusetts, to the Year 1850, New-England Historic Genealogical Society, Boston, 1904, p. 12.

==Early life==
Banks was born at [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], the first child of Nathaniel P. Banks, Sr., and Rebecca Greenwood Banks.<ref>Vital Records of Waltham, Massachusetts, to the Year 1850, New-England Historic Genealogical Society, Boston, 1904, p. 12.</ref> He received only a common school education and at an early age began work as a [[bobbin boy]] in a local cotton factory;<ref>Banks, R.H., King of Louisiana, 1862-1865, and Other Government Work, priv. print, Las Vegas, 2005, pp. 9-10. |url=http://www.members.cox.net/rayhbanks/Pages6-10.html</ref> throughout his life he was known by the humorous nickname, Bobbin Boy Banks.

==Political career==
Banks served as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] from 1849 to 1853, and was speaker in 1851 and 1852; he was president of the state [[Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1853|Constitutional Convention of 1853]], and in the same year was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] as a coalition candidate of Democrats and [[United States Free Soil Party|Free-Soilers]]. In 1854, he was reelected as a [[Know Nothing]].

At the opening of the Thirty-Fourth Congress, men from several parties opposed to slavery's spread gradually united in supporting Banks for speaker, and after the longest and one of the most bitter speakership contests ever, lasting, from December 3, 1855 to February 2, 1856, he was chosen on the 133rd ballot. This has been called the first national victory of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] party. He gave antislavery men important posts in Congress for the first time, and cooperated with investigations of both the Kansas conflict and the caning of Senator [[Charles Sumner]]. Yet, he also left a legacy of fairness in his appointments and decisions. He played a key role in 1856 in bringing forward [[John C. Fr<U+00E9>mont]] as a moderate Republican presidential nominee. As a part of this process, Banks declined, as pre-arranged, the presidential nomination of those Know-Nothings, opposed to the spread of slavery, in favor of Republican Fr<U+00E9>mont. For the next few years, Banks was supported by a coalition of Know-Nothings and Republicans in Massachusetts. His interest in the Know-Nothing legislative agenda was minimal, supporting only some tougher residency requirements for voting.

Re-elected in 1856 as a Republican, he resigned his seat in December 1857, and was [[governor of Massachusetts]] from 1858 to 1860, during a period of government contraction forced by the depression of those years. He made a serious attempt to gain the Republican presidential nomination in 1860, but discord within his party in Massachusetts, a residence in a "safe" Republican state, and his Know-Nothing past doomed his chances. He then was briefly resident director in [[Chicago, Illinois]], of the [[Illinois Central Railroad]], hired primarily to promote sale of the railroad's extensive lands.

==Civil War==
As the Civil War became imminent, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] considered Banks for a cabinet post, and eventually chose him as one of the first [[Major general (United States)|major general]]s of volunteers, appointing him on May 16, 1861. Perceptions that the Massachusetts militia was well organized and armed at the beginning of the Civil War likely played a role in the appointment decision, as Banks had also been considered for [[quartermaster general]]. He was initially resented by many of the generals who had graduated from the [[United States Military Academy]], but Banks brought political benefits to the administration, including the ability to attract recruits and money for the Federal cause.

===First command===
Banks first commanded at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], suppressing support for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in a slave-holding state that was at risk of seceding, then was sent to command on the upper [[Potomac River|Potomac]] when Brig. Gen. [[Robert Patterson]] failed to move aggressively in that area.

===The Shenandoah Valley Campaign===
When Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]] entered upon his [[Peninsula Campaign]] in spring 1862, the important duty of keeping the Confederate forces of [[Stonewall Jackson]] in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] from reinforcing the defenses of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] fell to the two divisions commanded by Banks. When Banks's men reached the southern Valley at the end of a difficult supply line, the president recalled them to [[Strasburg, Virginia]], at the northern end. Jackson then marched rapidly down the adjacent Luray Valley, driving Banks's retreating men from [[Winchester, Virginia]], on May 25, and north to the [[Potomac River]]. Jackson's campaign of maneuver and lightning strikes against superior forces in the Valley&mdash;under Banks and other Union generals&mdash;humiliated the North and made him one of the most famous generals in American history.

[[File:GenNPBanks.jpg|thumb|right|230px|General Nathaniel P. Banks]]
On August 9, Banks again encountered Jackson at [[Battle of Cedar Mountain|Cedar Mountain]], in [[Culpeper County, Virginia|Culpeper County]], and attacked him to gain early advantage, but a Confederate counterattack led by [[A.P. Hill]] repulsed Banks's corps and won the day. The arrival at the end of the day of Union reinforcements under Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], as well as the rest of Jackson's men, resulted in a two-day stand-off there. The Northern newspapers provided flattering versions of Banks's performance while Southern newspapers called the battle a Southern victory.

===The Army of the Gulf===
Banks next received command of the defense forces at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. In November 1862 he was asked to organize a force of 30,000 new recruits, drawn from [[New York]] and [[New England]]. As a former governor of Massachusetts, he was politically connected to the governors of these states, and the recruitment effort was successful.  In December he sailed from [[New York]] with a this large force of raw recruits to replace Maj. Gen. [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] at [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], as commander of the Department of the Gulf. Under orders to ascend the [[Mississippi River]] to join forces with [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who was then trying to capture [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], Banks first pushed a Confederate force up the [[Bayou Teche|Teche Bayou]] and marched to [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], hauling off slaves, cotton, and cattle from a rich agricultural area.

===Siege of Port Hudson===
When the Confederates reduced their garrison at [[Port Hudson, Louisiana]], on the Mississippi, he invested that place in May 1863. Two attempts to carry the works by storm during the [[Siege of Port Hudson]], as at Vicksburg, were dismal failures. Port Hudson was the first time African American soldiers were used in a major Civil War battle, as permitted by Banks. Low on food and ammunition, the garrison surrendered on July 9, 1863, after receiving word that Vicksburg had fallen. The entire Mississippi River was then under Union control.

In the autumn of 1863, Banks organized two seaborne expeditions to [[Texas]], chiefly for the purpose of preventing the French in [[Mexico]] from aiding the Confederates or occupying Texas, and he eventually secured possession of the region near the mouth of the [[Rio Grande]] and the Texas outer islands.

===Red River Campaign===
The [[Red River Campaign]], March&ndash;May 1864, was considered a strategic distraction by his superior, Ulysses S. Grant, who wanted Banks to drive east to capture [[Mobile, Alabama]], as part of a coordinated series of offensives in the spring of 1864. Banks in 1863 had disagreed with the Red River plan, hoping instead to mount sea expeditions to capture the Galveston area and Mobile, but the Red River movement was continually promoted by Chief of Staff [[Henry Halleck]] to Banks. When preparations for the 1864 Red River expedition were far advanced Halleck wrote Banks he was withdrawing any suggestion as to action after receiving from Banks a detailed negative report about the operation from one of Banks's West Point-trained officers.  Halleck continually implied to Banks, however, that the other major commanders favored the expedition.  There is no evidence Halleck provided the negative report on the Red River to Grant who was being asked for input on overall operations at the time.  Halleck began referring to the Red River expedition as Banks's plan in keeping with an established pattern of deflecting responsibility.

Banks' Army was routed at the [[Battle of Mansfield]] by General [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]] (son of former President [[Zachary Taylor]]) and retreated twenty miles to make a stand the next day at the [[Battle of Pleasant Hill]]. They continued the retreat to Alexandria where they rejoined with part of the Federal Inland Fleet. That naval force under [[David Dixon Porter]] had joined the Red River Campaign to support the army and to take on cotton as lucrative prizes of war, and Banks had allowed rich speculators to come along for the gathering of cotton. Added to the mix was a cooperating force unable to arrive overland from Arkansas, two attached corps belonging to General [[William T. Sherman]] acting semi-independently, and dangerously low water levels on the river that supplied the army.

Part of Porter's large fleet became trapped above the falls at Alexandria by the low water. Banks and others approved a plan proposed by [[Joseph Bailey (general)|Joseph Bailey]] to build wing dams as a means to raise what little water was left in the channel. In ten days, 10,000 troops built two dams, and managed to rescue Porter's fleet, allowing all to retreat to the Mississippi River.

After the campaign, just before General Sherman began his operations against Atlanta, Sherman called the Red River Campaign "One damn blunder from beginning to end."

Banks was removed from field command in Louisiana after the Red River Campaign. 

The Confederates held the Red River for the remainder of the war. They finally surrendered June 1865, two months after [[Robert E. Lee]] sued for peace at [[Appomattox Court House]] in [[Virginia]].

===Administrative duties===
While retaining his administrative command of the Army of the Gulf from New Orleans, he went on leave in fall 1864 to the North where President Lincoln delegated Banks to lobby through the winter for the president's reconstruction plans for [[Louisiana]]. Banks had earlier engineered the election victory of a moderate loyalist civilian government in Louisiana, inaugurated by elaborate celebrations he organized and funded. The secret presidential investigating commission headed by conservative Democrats [[William Farrar Smith]] and James T. Brady in early 1865 devoted considerable effort to trying to connect Banks with vice and irregular trading permits in the New Orleans area. The somewhat one-sided final commission report, which did not specifically accuse him of wrongdoing, was never released.  But Banks had definitely granted special favors without apparent compensation to men later connected to the [[Cr<U+00E9>dit Mobilier of America scandal|Cr<U+00E9>dit Mobilier]] scandal and to a few others of questionable reputation.

==Postbellum career==
[[File:Nathaniel Prentice Banks - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|left|215px|Postbellum portrait by [[Mathew Brady]] or [[Levin C. Handy]]]]
In August 1865, Banks was mustered out of the service by President [[Andrew Johnson]], and from 1865 to 1873, he was again a representative in Congress, serving as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee and sometimes as chair of the Republican caucus. He played a key role in the final passage of the [[Alaska Purchase]] legislation, supported women's suffrage and was one of the strongest early advocates of [[Manifest Destiny]]. Banks's financial records strongly suggest he received a large gratuity from the Russian minister after the Alaska legislation passed.<ref>Banks, R.H., King of Louisiana, 1862-1865, and Other Government Work, priv. print, Las Vegas, 2005, pp. 1312-17. |url=http://www.members.cox.net/morebanks/Pages1312-1317.html</ref>  Banks wanted the United States to acquire Canada and the Caribbean islands to reduce European influence in the region. He also served on the committee investigating the Cr<U+00E9>dit Mobilier scandal. 

Unhappiness with the course of the administration of President Ulysses Grant led in 1872 to his joining the [[United States Liberal Republican Party|Liberal-Republican revolt]] in support of [[Horace Greeley]]. While Banks was campaigning across the North for Greeley, an opponent successfully gathered enough support back in his Massachusetts district to defeat him as the joint Liberal-Republican and Democratic candidate. He thought his involvement with a start-up Kentucky railroad and other railroads would substitute for the political loss. But the [[Panic of 1873]] doomed the railroad, and Banks went on the lecture circuit and served in the Massachusetts Senate. 

In 1874, he was elected to Congress again as an independent and served the following two terms, again as a Republican (1875&ndash;1879). He was a member of the committee investigating the irregular 1876 elections in [[South Carolina]]. Defeated for yet another term, the president appointed him [[United States Marshals Service|United States marshal]] for Massachusetts, a post he held from 1879 until 1888, when for the tenth time, he was elected to [[United States Congress|Congress]] as a Republican. This final term saw significant mental deterioration, and he was not renominated. He died at [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], and is buried there in Grove Hill Cemetery. 

The [[Fort Banks Mortar Battery]] in [[Winthrop, Massachusetts]], built in 1892, was named for him.<ref name=whc>Plaque on site provided by Winthrop Historical Commission. Photographed 19-Oct-2009</ref>
