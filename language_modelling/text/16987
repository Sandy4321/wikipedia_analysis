The class '''WDM-2''' is [[Indian Railways]]' workhorse [[diesel locomotive]]. The first units were imported fully built from the [[American Locomotive Company]] (Alco) in [[1962]]. Since [[1964]], it has been manufactured in India by the [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi. The model name stands for [[broad gauge]] (W), diesel (D), mixed traffic (M) engine. The WDM-2 is the most common diesel locomotive of Indian Railways.

The '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s. The '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of 120 [[kilometres per hour|km/h]] (75 [[miles per hour|mph]]), restricted to 100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) when run long hood forward. The gear ratio is 65:18.

==History==
During the mainline dieselification project undertaken by the [[Indian railways]] in the early sixties, diesel locomotive designs were requested from [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] and the American locomotive company([[ALCO]]). Both General motors and ALCO presnted two prototypes. They were named WDM-4 and WDM-2 class in [[India]] respectively. Technically General motor's WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2. But Indian railway demanded a transfer of technology agreement that will allow to built those engines inside India under the company's permission. As General motors did not agree to the proposal and ALCO did, the ALCO prototype was chosen.


However, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from [[ALCO]] classified as WDM-1 in 1957[:[

After importing the first few prototypes, when the Diesel locomotive factory was set up in Varanasi production of the locomotives started in [[India]]. The first 12 locos were built from imported kits from ALCO. Then DLW started making complete locos. Since then 2800+ locos have been manufactured and WDM-2 has become the most widely popular locomotive in India.

Later a number of modifications were made and a few subclasses were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A(formerly WDM-2C).
