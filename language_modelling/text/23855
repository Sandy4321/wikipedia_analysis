'''Edward I''' (17/18 June 1239 <U+2013> 7 July 1307), also known as '''Edward Longshanks''', was [[King of England]] from 1272 to 1307. The first son of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], Edward was involved early  in the political intrigues of his father's reign, which included an outright rebellion by the English Barons. In 1259 he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement, supporting the [[Provisions of Oxford]]. After reconciliation with his father, however, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the [[Second Barons' War|Barons' War]]. After the [[Battle of Lewes]], Edward was given as hostage to the rebellious barons, but escaped after a few months and joined the fight against [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]]. Montfort was defeated at the [[Battle of Evesham]] in 1265, and within two years the rebellion was extinguished. With England pacified, Edward left on [[Ninth Crusade|crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]]. The crusade accomplished little, and Edward was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and he was crowned king at Westminster on 19 August.

Edward's reign had two characteristic phases.  He spent the first years reforming royal administration. Through an extensive legal inquiry, known as the ''[[Quo warranto]]'' proceedings, Edward investigated the rights through which  various [[feudal]] liberties were held. The law was reformed through a series of [[statute]]s regulating criminal and property law. Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs. After suppressing a minor rebellion in [[Wales]] in 1276&ndash;77, Edward responded to a second rebellion in 1282&ndash;83 with a full-scale war of conquest. After a successful campaign, Edward subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with Englishmen. Next, he directed his efforts towards Scotland. Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal [[suzerainty]] over the kingdom. In [[First Scottish War of Independence|the war]] that followed, the Scots persevered, even though the English seemed victorious at several points. At the same time there were problems at home. In the years from 1294 to 1297, the war in Scotland combined with another rebellion in Wales and a wasteful campaign to protect the English possessions in France. The result was an unbearable burden of taxation on the English people, and Edward met with resistance both from lay and ecclesiastical lords. These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled and when the king died in 1307, he left behind a number of financial and political problems to his son [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], as well as an ongoing war with Scotland.

Edward I was a tall man for his age, hence the nickname "Longshanks". He was also temperamental and this, along with his height, made him an intimidating man and he often instilled fear in his contemporaries. Nevertheless, he held the respect of his subjects for the way in which he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship, both as a soldier, administrator and a man of faith. Modern historians have been more divided on their assessment of the king; while some have praised him for his contribution to the law and administration, others have criticised him for his uncompromising attitude to his nobility. Currently, Edward I is credited with many accomplishments during his reign, including restoring royal authority after the reign of Henry III, establishing parliament as a permanent institution and thereby also a functional system for raising taxes, and reforming the law through statutes. At the same time, he is also often criticised for other actions, such as his brutal conduct towards the Scots, and the expulsion of the [[Jew]]s from England in 1290.

==Early years==
===Childhood and marriage===
Edward was born at the [[Palace of Westminster]] on the night of 17/18 June 1239, to King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] and [[Eleanor of Provence]].<ref>As the sources give the time simply as the night between the 17 and 18 June, we can not know the exact date of Edward<U+2019>s birth: {{Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=2}}</ref> Although the young prince was seriously ill on several occasions, in 1246, 1247, and 1251, he grew up to be strong and healthy.<ref name="DNB"/> Edward was in the care of Hugh Giffard{{ndash}} father of the future [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Godfrey Giffard]]{{ndash}} until Bartholomew Pecche took over at Giffard's death in 1246.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=5&ndash;6}}</ref> Among his childhood friends was his cousin [[Henry of Almain]], son of King Henry's brother [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]].<ref name="DNB">Prestwich (2004).</ref> Henry of Almein would remain a close companion of the prince, both through the civil war that followed, and later on the crusade.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=46, 69}}</ref>

[[File:Edward I and Eleanor.jpg|thumb|upright|Early fourteenth-century manuscript [[initial]] showing Edward and Eleanor. The artist has perhaps tried to depict Edward's drooping eyelid, a trait he inherited from his father.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=22}}</ref>]]
In 1254 English fears of a [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian]] invasion of the English province of [[Gascony]] induced Edward's father to arrange a politically expedient marriage between his fourteen year old son and [[Eleanor of Castile|Eleanor]], the half-sister of King [[Alfonso X of Castile]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=14&ndash;8}}</ref> Eleanor and Edward were married on 1 November 1254 in the monastery of [[Abbey of Santa Maria la Real de Huelgas|Las Huelgas]] in Castile.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=20}}</ref> As part of the marriage agreement, the young prince received grants of land worth 15,000 [[Mark (money)|marks]] a year.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=10}}</ref> Though the endowments King Henry made were sizable, they offered Edward little independence: He had already received Gascony as early as 1249, but [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]] had been appointed as royal lieutenant the year before and, consequently, drew its income, so in practice Edward derived neither authority nor revenue from this province.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=7&ndash;8}}</ref> The grant he received in 1254 included most of [[Ireland]], and much land in [[Wales]] and England, including the [[Earl of Chester|earldom of Chester]], but the king retained much control over the land in question, particularly in Ireland, so Edward's power was limited there as well, and the king derived most of the income from those lands as well.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=11&ndash;4}}</ref> <!-- The king maintained much control of the land in question and, particularly in Ireland, Edward<U+2019>s power was limited.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=11&ndash;4}}</ref> -->

From 1254 to 1257, Edward was under the influence his mother's relatives, known as the Savoyards,<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007 |p=96}}</ref>  the most notable of whom was  [[Peter II of Savoy|Peter of Savoy]], the queen<U+2019>s uncle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=7}}</ref>  After 1257, he increasingly fell in with the Poitevin, or Lusignan faction{{ndash}} the half-brothers of his father Henry III{{ndash}} led by such men as [[William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William de Valence]].<ref>Henry III's mother [[Isabella of Angoul<U+00EA>me]] married [[Hugh X of Lusignan]] after the death of King [[John of England|John]]; {{Harvnb|Prestwich|2005|p=94}}.</ref> This association was significant, because the two groups of privileged foreigners were resented by the established English aristocracy, and would be at the centre of the ensuing years' baronial reform movement.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=95}}</ref> There were tales of unruly and violent conduct by Edward and his Lusignan kinsmen, which raised questions about the royal heir's personal qualities. The next years would be formative on Edward's character.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=23}}</ref>

===Early ambitions===
Edward had shown independence in political matters as early as 1255, when he took sides in a local conflict in Gascony, a stand that ran contrary to his father<U+2019>s policy of mediation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=15&ndash;6}}</ref> In May 1258, a group of magnates drew up a document for reform of the king<U+2019>s government{{ndash}} the so-called [[Provisions of Oxford]]{{ndash}} largely directed against the Lusignans. Edward stood by his political allies, and strongly opposed the Provisions. The reform movement succeeded in limiting the Lusignan influence, however, and gradually Edward<U+2019>s attitude started to change. In March 1259, he entered into a formal alliance with one of the main reformers [[Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford|Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester]]. Then, on 15 October, 1259 he announced that he supported the barons' goals, and their leader, Simon de Montfort.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=David|date=1985|title=The Lord Edward's oath to aid and counsel Simon de Montfort, 15 October 1259|journal=Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research|volume=58|pages=pp. 226&ndash;37}}</ref>

The motive behind Edward<U+2019>s change of heart could have been purely pragmatic; Montfort was in a good position to support his cause in Gascony.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=31&ndash;2}}</ref> When the king left for France in November, Edward's behaviour turned into pure insubordination.  He made several appointments to advance the cause of the reformers, causing his father to believe that his son was considering a ''coup d'etat''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=32&ndash;3}}</ref> When the king returned from France, he initially refused to see his son, but through the mediation of the Earl of Cornwall and the [[Boniface of Savoy (archbishop)|archbishop of Canterbury]], the two were eventually reconciled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=44&ndash;5}}</ref> Edward was sent abroad, and in November 1260 he once more united with the Lusignans, who had been exiled to France.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=34}}</ref>

Back in England, early in 1262, Edward fell out with some of his former Luisignan allies over financial matters. The next year King henry sent him on a campaign in Wales against [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], with only limited results.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=171&ndash;2}}</ref> Around the same time, Simon de Montfort, who had been out of the country since 1261, returned to England and re-ignited the baronial reform movement.<ref>{{Harvnb|Maddicott|1994|p=225}}</ref> It was at this pivotal moment, as the king seemed ready to resign to the barons' demands, that Edward began to take control of the situation. Whereas he had so far been unpredictable and equivocating, from this point on he remained firmly devoted to protecting his father's royal rights.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=178}}</ref> He reunited with some of the men he had alienated the year before{{ndash}} among them his childhood friend, Henry of Almain, and [[John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey|John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey]]{{ndash}} and retook [[Windsor Castle]] from the rebels.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=41}}</ref> Through the arbitration of King [[Louis IX of France]], an agreement was made between the two parties. This so-called [[Mise of Amiens]] was largely favourable to the royalist side, and laid the seeds for further conflict.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=113}}</ref>

===Civil war===
{{See also|Second Barons' War}}
The years 1264&ndash;1267 saw the conflict known as the [[Second Barons' War|Barons' War]], where baronial forces led by Simon de Montfort fought against those who remained loyal to the king.<ref>This conflict is often referred to as the [[Second Barons' War]], to distinguish it from the civil war{{ndash}} or the [[First Barons' War]]{{ndash}} of 1215&ndash;1217.</ref> The first scene of battle was the city of [[Gloucester]], which Edward managed to retake from the enemy. When [[Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby|Robert de Ferrers, earl of Derby]], came to the assistance of the rebels, Edward negotiated a truce with the earl, the terms of which he later broke. Edward then proceeded to capture [[Northampton]] from Montfort's son [[Simon VI de Montfort|Simon]], before embarking on a retaliatory campaign against Derby's lands.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=42&ndash;3}}</ref> The baronial and royalist forces finally met at the [[Battle of Lewes]], on 14 May 1264. Edward, commanding the right wing, performed well, and soon defeated the London contingent of Montfort's forces. Unwisely, however, he followed the scattered enemy in pursuit, and on his return found the rest of the royal army defeated.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sadler|2008|pp=55&ndash;69}}</ref> By the agreement known as the [[Mise of Lewes]], Edward and his cousin Henry of Almein were given up as a prisoners to Montfort.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maddicott|first=John|authorlink=John Maddicott|date=1983|title=The Mise of Lewes, 1264|journal=[[English Historical Review]]|volume=98|pages=pp. 588&ndash;603|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/569785}}</ref>

[[File:Montfort Evesham.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Medieval manuscript showing [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]]'s mutilated body at the field of [[Battle of Evesham|Evesham]]]]
Edward remained in captivity until March and even after his release he was kept under strict surveillance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=47&ndash;8}}</ref> Then, on 28 May, he managed to escape his custodians, and joined up with the [[Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford|earl of Gloucester]], who had recently defected to the king's side.<ref>This was [[Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford|Gilbert de Clare]], son of the aforementioned [[Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford|Richard de Clare]]; {{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=48&ndash;9}}.</ref> Montfort's support was now dwindling, and Edward retook [[Worcester]] and Gloucester with relatively little effort.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=49&ndash;50}}</ref> In the meanwhile, Montfort had made an alliance with Llywelyn, and started moving east to join forces with his son Simon. Edward managed to make a surprise attack at [[Kenilworth Castle]], where the younger Montfort was quartered, before moving on to cut off the earl of Leicester.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=201&ndash;2}}</ref> The two forces then met at the second great encounter of the Barons' War{{ndash}} the [[Battle of Evesham]], on 4 August 1265. Montfort stood little chance against the superior royal forces, and after his defeat he was killed and mutilated in the field.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sadler|2008|pp=105&ndash;9}}</ref>
Through such episodes as the deception of Derby at Gloucester, Edward acquired a reputation as untrustworthy. During the summer campaign though, he had began to learn from his mistakes, and acted in a way that gained the respect and admiration of his contemporaries.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=75&ndash;6}}</ref> The war did not end with Montfort's death, and Edward participated in the continued campaigning. At Christmas he came to terms with the younger Simon de Montfort and his associates at the [[Isle of Axholme]] in [[Lincolnshire]], and in March he led a successful assault on the [[Cinque Ports]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=55}}</ref> A contingent of rebels held out in the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle, and did not surrender until the drafting of the conciliatory [[Dictum of Kenilworth]].<ref>The Dictum restored land to the disinherited rebels, in exchange for a fine decided by their level of involvement in the wars; {{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=117}}</ref> In April it seemed as if Gloucester would take up the cause of the reform movement, and civil war would resume, but after a renegotiation of the terms of the Dictum of Kenilworth the parties came to an agreement.<ref>The essential concession was that the disinherited would now be allowed to take possession of their lands ''before'' paying the fines; {{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=121}}</ref> Edward, however, was little involved in the settlement negotiations following the wars; at this point his main focus was on planning his upcoming [[crusade]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=63}}</ref>

===Crusade and accession===
{{See also|Eighth Crusade|Ninth Crusade}}<!-- <ref>The [[Eighth Crusade]] was [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]]'s campaign in [[Tunisia]], while the [[Ninth Crusade]] was Edward's expedition to the [[Holy Land]]. The two are sometime considered as one crusade.</ref> -->
Edward took the crusader's cross in an elaborate ceremony on 24 June 1268, with his brother [[Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster|Edmund]] and cousin Henry of Almain. Among others who committed themselves to the ninth Crusade were Edward's former adversaries&mdash;like the earl of Gloucester, though the earl did not end up going.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=83, 90&ndash;2}}</ref> With the country pacified, the greatest impediment to the project was providing sufficient finances.<ref name="P71">{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=71}}</ref> King [[Louis IX of France]], who was the leader of the crusade, provided a loan of about <U+00A3>17,500.<ref name="P72">{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=72}}</ref> This, however, was not enough; the rest had to be raised through a [[Laity|lay tax]], which had not been levied since 1237.<ref name="P72"/> In May 1270, Parliament granted a tax of a twentieth,<ref>This meant a grant of 1/20 of all movable property.</ref> in exchange for which the king agreed to reconfirm [[Magna Carta]], and to impose restrictions on [[Jew]]ish money lending.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Maddicott|authorlink=John Maddicott|editor=P.

Originally, the Crusaders intended to relieve the beleaguered Christian stronghold of [[Acre (Israel)|Acre]], but Louis had been diverted to [[Tunis]]. The French king and his brother [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]], who had made himself [[List of monarchs of Sicily|king of Sicily]], decided to attack the emirate in order to establish a stronghold in [[North Africa]].<ref name="P73">{{Harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=210}}</ref> The plans failed when the French forces were struck by an epidemic which, on 25 August, took the life of King Louis himself.<ref>The disease in question was either [[dysentery]] or [[typhus]]; {{Harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=210&ndash;1}}</ref> By the time Edward arrived at Tunis, Charles had already signed a treaty with the emir, and there was little else to do than to return to Sicily. The crusade was postponed until next spring, but a devastating storm off the coast of Sicily dissuaded Charles of Anjou and Louis's successor [[Philip III of France|Philip III]] from any further campaigning.<ref>{{Harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=211}}</ref> Edward decided to continue alone, and on 9 May 1271&nbsp;he finally landed at Acre.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=75}}</ref>

[[Image:EdwardICrusadeMap.jpg|thumb|Operations during the Crusade of Edward I]]
By then, the situation in the [[Holy Land]] was a precarious one. [[Jerusalem]] had fallen in 1187, and Acre was now the centre of the Christian state.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=95}}</ref> The [[Islam|Muslim]] states were on the offensive under the [[Bahri dynasty|Mamluk]] leadership of [[Baibars]], and were now threatening Acre itself. Though Edward's men were an important addition to the garrison, they stood little chance against Baibars' superior forces, and an initial raid at nearby [[St Georges-de-Lebeyne]] in June was largely futile.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=76}}</ref> An embassy to the [[Mongols]] helped bring about an [[Mongol invasions of Syria|attack]] on [[Aleppo]] in the north, which helped to distract the Baibar forces.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=97&ndash;8}}</ref> In November, Edward led a raid on [[Qaqun]], which could have served as a bridgehead to Jerusalem, but both the Mongol invasion and the attack on Qaqun failed. Things now seemed increasingly desperate, and in May 1272&nbsp;[[Hugh III of Cyprus]], who was the nominal [[Kings of Jerusalem|king of Jerusalem]], signed a ten&ndash;year truce with Baibars.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=77}}</ref> Edward was initially defiant, but an attack by a Muslim assassin in June forced him to abandon any further campaigning. Even though he managed to kill the assassin, he was struck in the arm by a dagger feared to be poisoned, and became severely weakened over the next months.<ref>The anecdote of Queen Eleanor saving Edward's life by sucking the poison out of his wound is almost certainly a later fabrication; {{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=78}}</ref><ref>Other accounts of the scene have Eleanor being led away weeping by John de Vescy, and suggest that it was another of Edward's close friends, Otto de Grandson, who attempted the sucking operation; {{Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=101}}</ref>

It was not until 24 September that Edward left Acre. Arriving in Sicily, he was met with the news that his father had died on 16&nbsp;November.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=78, 82}}</ref> Edward was deeply saddened by this news, but rather than hurrying home at once, he made a leisurely journey northwards. This was partly due to his health still being poor, but also due to a lack of urgency.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=82}}</ref> The political situation in England was stable after the mid-century upheavals, and Edward was proclaimed king at his father's death, rather than at his own coronation, as had up until then been customary.<ref>Though no written proof exists, it is assumed that this arrangement was agreed on before Edward's departure; {{Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=104}}</ref> In Edward's absence, the country was governed by a royal council, led by [[Robert Burnell]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Carpenter|2003|p=466}}</ref> The new king embarked on an overland journey through [[Italy]] and France, where among other things he visited the pope in [[Rome]] and suppressed a rebellion in Gascony.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=82&ndash;5}}</ref> Only on 2 August 1274&nbsp;did he return to England, and was crowned on 19 August.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=226}}</ref>

==Reign==
===Administration and the law===
Upon returning home, Edward immediately embarked on the administrative business of the nation, and his major concern was restoring order and re-establishing royal authority after the disastrous reign of his father.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=116&ndash;7}}</ref> In order to accomplish this he immediately ordered an extensive change of administrative personnel. The most important of these was the appointment of Robert Burnell as [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]]; a man who would remain in the post until 1292, as one of the king's closest associates.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=92}}</ref> Edward then proceeded to replace most local officials, such as the [[escheat]]ors and [[High Sheriff|sheriffs]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=93}}</ref> This last measure was done in preparation for an extensive inquest covering all of England, that would hear complaints about abuse of power by royal officers. The inquest produced the so-called [[Hundred Rolls]], from the administrative sub-division of the [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]].<ref>The few surviving documents from the Hundred Rolls show the vast scope of the project. They are dealt with extensively in: {{cite book|last=Helen Cam|first=|authorlink=Helen Cam|title=The Hundred and the Hundred Rolls: An Outline of Local Government in Medieval England|publisher=Merlin Press|location=London|date=1963|edition=New}}</ref>

[[File:Groat of Edward I 4 pences.jpg|left|thumb|[[Groat]] of Edward I (4 [[pence]])]]
The second purpose of the inquest was to establish what land and rights the crown had lost during the reign of Henry III.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=115}}</ref> The Hundred Rolls formed the basis for the later legal inquiries called the ''[[Quo warranto]]'' proceedings. The purpose of these inquiries was to establish by what warrant ([[Latin]]: ''Quo warranto'') various [[Liberty (division)|liberties]] were held.<ref>Among those singled out in particular by the royal justices was the earl of Gloucester, who was seen to have encroached ruthlessly on royal rights over the preceeing years; {{Harvnb|Sutherland|1963|pp=146&ndash;7}}</ref> If the defendant could not produce a royal licence to prove the grant of the liberty, then it was the crown's opinion{{ndash}} based on the writings of [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton]]{{ndash}} that the liberty should revert to the king.

The 1290 Statute of ''Quo warranto'' was only one part of a wider legislative effort, which was one of the most important contributions of Edward I's reign.<ref name="DNB"/> This era of legislative action had started already at the time of the baronial reform movement; the [[Statute of Marlborough]] (1267) contained elements both of the Provisions of Oxford and the Dictum of Kenilworth.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brand|first=Paul|title=Kings, Barons and Justices: The Making and Enforcement of Legislation in Thirteenth-Century England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|date=2003|isbn=0521372461}}</ref> The compilation of the Hundred Rolls was followed shortly after by the issue of [[Statutes of Westminster|Westminster I]] (1275), which asserted the [[Royal Prerogative|royal prerogative]] and outlined restrictions on liberties.<ref>{{Harvnb|Plucknett|1949|pp=29&ndash;30}}</ref> In [[Statute of Mortmain|Mortmain]] (1279), the issue was grants of land to the church.<ref>{{Harvnb|Plucknett|1949|pp=94&ndash;8}}</ref> The first clause of [[Statutes of Westminster|Westminster II]] (1285), known as ''[[De donis conditionalibus]]'', dealt with family settlement of land, and [[Fee tail|entails]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=273}}</ref> [[Statute merchant|Merchants]] (1285) established firm rules for the recovery of debts,<ref>{{Harvnb|Plucknett|1949|pp=140&ndash;4}}</ref> while [[Statute of Winchester|Winchester]] (1285) dealt with peacekeeping on a local level.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=280&ndash;1}}</ref> ''[[Quia emptores]]'' (1290){{ndash}} issued along with ''Quo warranto''{{ndash}} set out to remedy land ownership disputes resulting from alienation of land by [[subinfeudation]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Plucknett|1949|pp=45, 102&ndash;4}}</ref> The age of the great statutes largely ended with the death of Robert Burnell in 1292.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=293}}</ref>

===Welsh wars===
[[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] enjoyed an advantageous situation in the aftermath of the Barons' War. Through the 1267 [[Treaty of Montgomery]] he officially obtained land he had conquered in the [[Kingdom_of_Gwynedd#Perfeddwlad|Four Cantrefs of Perfeddwlad]], and was recognised in his title of [[Prince of Wales]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Carpenter|2003|p=386}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=132}}</ref> Armed conflicts nevertheless continued, in particular with certain dissatisfied [[Marcher Lords]], such as the earl of Gloucester, [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer|Roger Mortimer]] and [[Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford|Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Davies|2000|pp=322&ndash;3}}</ref> Problems were exacerbated when his younger brother [[Dafydd ap Gruffydd|Dafydd]] and [[Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn]] of [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]], after a failed assassination attempt against Llywelyn, defected to the English in 1274.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=175}}</ref> Citing ongoing hostilities and the English king harbouring his enemies, Llywelyn refused to do homage to Edward.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=174&ndash;5}}</ref> For Edward, a further provocation came in the form of Llywelyn's planned marriage to [[Eleanor de Montfort|Eleanor]], daughter of Simon de Montfort.<ref>{{Harvnb|Davies|2000|p=327}}</ref> In November 1276 war was declared.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=409}}</ref> Initial operations were launched under the captaincy of Mortimer, Lancaster (Edward's brother Edmund) and [[William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick|William de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick]].<ref>Lancaster's post was held by Payne de Chaworth until April; {{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=409}}.</ref> Support for Llywelyn was weak among his own countrymen.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=150}}</ref> In July 1277 Edward invaded with a force of 15,500{{ndash}} of whom 9,000 were Welshmen.<ref name="P151">{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=151}}</ref> The campaign never came to a major battle, and Llywelyn soon realised he had no choice but to surrender.<ref name="P151"/> By the [[Treaty of Aberconwy]] in November 1277, he was left only with the land of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]], though he was allowed to retain the title of Prince of Wales.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=413}}</ref>

When war broke out again in 1282, it was an entirely different undertaking. For the Welsh this war was over national identity, enjoying wide support, provoked particularly by attempts to impose [[English law]] on Welsh subjects.<ref>{{cite book|first=Rees|last=Davies|authorlink=Rees Davies|editor=R.

A [[pontoon bridge]] had been built to the mainland, but shortly after Tany and his men crossed over, they were ambushed by the Welsh, and suffered heavy losses at the [[Battle of Moel-y-don]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=191&ndash;2}}</ref> The Welsh advances ended on December 11, however, when Llywelyn was lured into a trap and killed at the [[Battle of Orewin Bridge]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Davies|2000|p=353}}</ref> The submission of Wales was complete with the capture in June 1283 of Dafydd, who was taken to [[Shrewsbury]] and executed as a traitor the following autumn.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carpenter|2003|p=510}}</ref>

[[File:Caernafon Wards.jpg|thumb|left|[[Caernarfon Castle]], one of the most imposing of Edward's Welsh castles.]]
Further rebellions occurred in 1287-8 and{{ndash}} more seriously{{ndash}} in 1294-5 under [[Madog ap Llywelyn]]. This last conflict demanded the king's own attention, but in both cases the rebellions were put down.<ref name="DNB"/> By the 1284 [[Statute of Rhuddlan]], the [[Principality of Wales]] was incorporated into England, and Wales was given an administrative system like the English, with counties policed by sheriffs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carpenter|2003|p=511}}</ref> English law was introduced in criminal cases, though the Welsh were allowed to maintain their own customary laws in some cases of property disputes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Davies|2000|p=368}}</ref> After 1277, and increasingly after 1283, Edward embarked on a full-scale project of English settlement of Wales, creating new towns like [[Flint, Flintshire|Flint]], [[Aberystwyth]], and [[Rhuddlan]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=216}}</ref> An extensive [[Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd|project]] of castle-building was also initiated. The assignment was given to Master [[James of Saint George]], a prestigious architect whom Edward had met in [[Savoy]] on his return from crusade. Among the major buildings were the castles of [[Beaumaris Castle|Beaumaris]], [[Caernarfon Castle|Caernarfon]], [[Conwy Castle|Conwy]] and [[Harlech Castle|Harlech]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=160}}</ref> In 1284, King Edward's son Edward{{ndash}} the later [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]{{ndash}} was born at Caernarfon Castle, and it was also here, in 1301, that the young Edward was the first English prince to be invested with the title of Prince of Wales.<ref>This title became the traditional title of the [[heir apparent]] to the English throne. Prince Edward was not born heir apparent, but became so when his older brother [[Alphonso, Earl of Chester|Alphonso]] died in 1284; {{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=126&ndash;7}}.</ref>

===Diplomacy and war on the Continent===
Edward never again went on crusade after his return to England in 1274, but he maintained an intention to do so, and took the cross again in 1287.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=326&ndash;8}}</ref> This intention guided much of his foreign policy, until at least 1291. To stage a European-wide crusade, it was essential to prevent conflict between the greater princes on the Continent. A major obstacle to this was represented by the conflict between the kingdom of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] in Spain and the French [[Capetian House of Anjou|House of Anjou]] ruling southern Italy. In 1282, the citizens of Palermo rose up against [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]], and turned for help to [[Peter III of Aragon|Peter of Aragon]], in what has become known as the [[Sicilian Vespers]]. In the war that followed, Charles of Anjou's son [[Charles II of Naples|Charles of Salerno]] was taken prisoner by the Aragonese.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=252&ndash;3}}</ref> The French began planning an attack on Aragon, raising the prospect of a large-scale European war. To Edward it was imperative that such a war be avoided, and in Paris in 1286, he brokered a truce between France and Aragon that helped secure Charles' release.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=323&ndash;5}}</ref> As far as the crusades were concerned, however, Edward's efforts proved ineffective. A devastating blow to his plans came in 1291, when the Mamluks captured Acre, the last Christian stronghold in the Holy Land.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=329}}</ref>

[[Image:Hommage of Edward I to Philippe le Bel.jpg|thumb|upright|Homage of Edward I (kneeling) to [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] (seated). As [[Duke of Aquitaine]], Edward was a [[vassal]] of the French king.]]
After the fall of Acre, Edward's international role changed from that of a diplomat to an antagonist. He had long been deeply involved in the affairs of his own Duchy of Gascony. In 1278 he assigned an investigating commission to his trusted associates [[Otton de Grandson|Otto de Grandson]] and the chancellor Robert Burnell, which caused the replacement of the seneschal Luke de Tany.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=304}}</ref> In 1286 he visited the region himself, and stayed for almost three years.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=204&ndash;17}}</ref> The perennial problem, however, was the status of Gascony within the kingdom of France, and Edward's role as the French king's vassal. On his diplomatic mission in 1286, Edward had paid homage to the new king, [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]], but in 1294 Philip declared Gascony forfeit when Edward refused to appear before him in Paris to discuss the recent conflict between English, Gascon, and French sailors (that had resulted in several French ships being captured, along with the sacking of the French port of La Rochelle)<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|pp=265&ndash;70}}</ref>

In the war that followed, Edward planned for a two-pronged attack. While the English forces focused on Gascony, alliances were made with the princes of the [[Low Countries]], [[Germany]], and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], who would attack France from the north.<ref name="DNB"/> The alliances proved volatile, however, and Edward was facing trouble at home at the time, both in Wales and Scotland. It was not until August 1297 that he was finally able to sail for Flanders, at which times his allies there had already suffered defeat.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=392}}</ref> The support from Germany never materialised, and Edward was forced to seek peace. His marriage to the French princess [[Marguerite of France (died 1318)|Margaret]] in 1299 put an end to the war, but the whole affair had proven both costly and fruitless for the English.<ref>Prestwich estimates the total cost to around <U+00A3>400,000; {{Harvnb|Prestwich|1972|p=172}}</ref>

===The Great Cause===
{{See also|Competitors for the Crown of Scotland}}
The relationship between the nations of England and [[Scotland]] by the 1280s was one of relatively harmonious coexistence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carpenter|2003|p=518}}</ref> The issue of homage did not reach the same level of controversy as it did in Wales; in 1278 King [[Alexander III of Scotland]] paid homage to Edward I, but apparently only for the lands he held of Edward in England.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=357}}</ref> Problems arose only with the Scottish succession crisis of the early 1290s. In the years from 1281 to 1284, Alexander's two sons and one daughter died in quick succession. Then, in 1286, King Alexander died himself, leaving as heir to the throne of Scotland 3 year old [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret, the Maid of Norway]], born in 1283 to Alexander's daughter [[Margaret of Scotland, Queen of Norway|Margaret]] and King [[Eric II of Norway]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Barrow|1965|pp=3&ndash;4}}</ref> By the [[Treaty of Birgham]] it was agreed that Margaret should marry King Edward's then 1 year old son [[Edward II of England|Edward of Carnarvon]], though Scotland would remain free of English [[Suzerainty|overlordship]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=361}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|p=235}}</ref>

Margaret, now 7 years of age, sailed from Norway for Scotland in the autumn of 1290, but fell ill on the way and died in [[Orkney]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Barrow|1965|p=42}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|p=237}}</ref> This left the country without an obvious heir, and led to the succession dispute known to history as the [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|Great Cause]].<ref>The term is an 18th-century invention; {{Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=253}}</ref> Even though as many as fourteen claimants put forward their claims to the title, the real contest was between [[John of Scotland|John Balliol]] and [[Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale|Robert Bruce]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=231}}</ref> The Scottish [[magnate]]s made a request to Edward to arbitrate in the dispute.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=601}}</ref> At Birgham, with the prospect of a personal union between the two realms, the question of suzerainty had not been of great importance to Edward. Now he insisted that, if he were to settle the contest, he had to be fully recognised as Scotland's feudal overlord.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=361&ndash;3}}</ref> The Scots were reluctant to make such a concession, and replied that since the country had no king, no one had the authority to make this decision.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barrow|1965|p=45}}</ref> This problem was circumvented when the competitors agreed that the realm would be handed over to Edward until a rightful heir had been found.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=365}}</ref> After a lengthy hearing, a decision was made in favour of John Balliol on 17 November 1292.<ref>Even though the principle of [[primogeniture]] did not necessarily apply to descent through female heirs, there is little doubt that Balliol's claim was the strongest one; {{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=358, 367}}</ref>

Even after Balliol's accession, Edward still continued to assert his authority over Scotland. Against the objections of the Scots, he agreed to hear appeals on cases ruled on by the court of guardians that had governed Scotland during the interregnum.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=370}}</ref> A further provocation came in a case brought by Macduff, son of [[Maol Choluim II, Earl of Fife|Malcolm, Earl of Fife]], where Edward demanded Balliol appear in person before the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] to answer the charges.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=371}}</ref> This the Scottish king did, but the final straw was Edward's demand that the Scottish magnates provide military service in the war against France.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barrow|1965|pp=86&ndash;8}}</ref> This was unacceptable; the Scots instead formed an [[Auld Alliance|alliance]] with France, and launched an unsuccessful attack on [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Barrow|1965|pp=88&ndash;91, 99}}</ref> Edward responded by invading Scotland in 1296, and taking the town of [[Berwick]] in a particularly bloody attack.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barrow|1965|pp=99&ndash;100}}</ref> At the [[Battle of Dunbar]], Scottish resistance was effectively crushed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=471&ndash;3}}</ref> Edward confiscated the [[Stone of Scone|Stone of Destiny]] {{ndash}} the Scottish coronation stone{{ndash}} and brought it to Westminster, deposed Balliol and placed him in the [[Tower of London]], and installed Englishmen to govern the country.<ref name="DNB"/> The campaign had been a great success, but the English triumph would eventually prove deceptive.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=376}}</ref>

===Finances, Parliament and the Persecution of Jews===
Edward I's frequent military campaigns put a great financial strain on the nation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harriss|1975|p=49}}</ref> There were several ways through which the king could raise money for war, including [[customs]] [[Duty (economics)|duties]], [[Moneylender|money lending]] and [[History of the English fiscal system#Direct taxation|lay subsidies]]. In 1275 Edward I negotiated an agreement with the domestic merchant community that secured a permanent duty on wool. In 1303 a similar agreement was reached with foreign merchants, in return for certain rights and privileges.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|1989|pp=65&ndash;6}}</ref> The revenues from the customs duty were handled by the [[Riccardi]]; a group of bankers from [[Lucca]] in [[Italy]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=99&ndash;100}}</ref> This was in return for their service as money lenders to the crown, which helped finance the Welsh Wars. When the war with France broke out, the French king confiscated the Riccardi's assets, and the bank went bankrupt.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|1989|pp=80&ndash;1}}</ref> After this, the [[Frescobaldi]] of [[Florence]] took over the role as money lenders to the English crown.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=403}}</ref>

The scene shows [[Alexander III of Scotland]] and [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] of Wales on either side of Edward; an episode that never actually occurred.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=plate 14}}</ref>]]
Another source of crown income was represented by [[History of the Jews in England|England's Jews]]. The Jews were the king's personal property, and he was free to tax them at will.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=344}}</ref> By the 1280 the Jews had been exploited to a level where they were no longer of much financial use to the crown, but they could still be used in political bargaining.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=344&ndash;5}}</ref> Their [[usury]] business{{ndash}} a practice forbidden to Christians{{ndash}} had made many people indebted to them, and caused general popular resentment.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=86}}</ref> In 1275, Edward had issued the [[Statute of the Jewry]], which outlawed usury and encouraged the Jews to take up other professions<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=322}}</ref>; in 1280 he ordered all Jews to attend special sermons, preached by Dominican friars, with the hope of persuading them to convert, but neither of these exhortations were followed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=226}}</ref> In 1279, in the context of a crack-down on [[Coin clipping|coin-clippers]], he arrested all the heads of Jewish households in England and had around 300 of them executed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=170&ndash;1}}</ref> The final attack on the Jews in England came in the form of the [[Edict of Expulsion]] in 1290, whereby Edward formally expelled all Jews from England.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=226&ndash;8}}</ref> This not only generated revenues through royal appropriation of Jewish loans and property, but it also gave Edward the political capital to negotiate a substantial lay subsidy in the 1290 Parliament.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=345}}; {{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=513}}</ref> The expulsion, which was not reversed until 1656,<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=346}}</ref> followed a precedence set by other European territorial princes; the king of France had expelled all Jews from his own lands in 1182; the duke of Brittany drove them out of his duchy in 1239; and in the late 1240s Louis IX had expelled the Jews from the royal demesne prior to his first passage to the East.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2009|p=226}}</ref>

One of the main achievements of the reign of Edward I was the reforms of the institution of the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]], and its transformation into a source for generating revenues.<ref name="DNB"/> Edward held Parliament at a more or less regular basis throughout his reign.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=342}}</ref> In 1295, however, a significant change occurred. For this Parliament, in addition to the secular and ecclesiastical lords, two knights from each county and two representatives from each borough were summoned.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|1989|p=185}}</ref> The representation of commons in Parliament was nothing new; what was new was the authority under which these representatives were summoned. Whereas previously the commons had been expected simply to assent to decisions already made by the magnates, it was now proclaimed that they should meet with the full authority (''plena potestas'') of their communities, to give assent to decisions made in Parliament.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harriss|1975|pp=41&ndash;2}}</ref> The king now had full backing for collecting lay subsidies from the entire population. Lay subsidies were taxes collected at a certain fraction of the moveable property of all laymen.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|1989|p=70&ndash;1}}</ref> Whereas Henry III had only collected four of these in his reign, Edward I collected nine.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|1989|p=71}}</ref> This format eventually became the standard for later Parliaments, and historians have named the assembly the "Model Parliament".<ref>The term was first introduced by [[William Stubbs]]; {{Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=283&ndash;4}}</ref>

===Constitutional crisis===
The incessant warfare of the 1290s put a great financial demand on Edward's subjects. Whereas the king had only levied three lay subsidies up until 1294, four such taxes were granted in the years 1294&ndash;97, raising over <U+00A3>200,000.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1972|p=179}}</ref> In addition to this came the burden of [[prise]]s (appropriation of food), seizure of wool and hides, and the unpopular additional duty on wool, dubbed the ''maltolt''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harriss|1975|p=57}}</ref> The fiscal demands on the king's subjects caused resentment, and this resentment eventually led to serious political opposition. The initial resistance was not caused by the lay taxes, however, but by clerical subsidies. In 1294, Edward made a demand of a grant of one half of all clerical revenues. There was some resistance, but the king responded by threatening with [[outlaw]]ry, and the grant was eventually made.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=403&ndash;4}}</ref> At the time, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury|archbishopric of Canterbury]] was vacant, since [[Robert Winchelsey]] was in Italy to receive consecration.<ref>Winchelsey's consecration was held up by the protracted [[Papal election, 1292<U+2013>1294|papal election of 1292&ndash;94]]; {{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=671}}</ref> Winchelsey returned in January 1295, and had to consent to another grant in November of that year. In 1296, however, his position changed when he received the [[papal bull]] ''[[Clericis laicos]]''. This bull prohibited the clergy from paying taxes to a lay authorities without explicit consent from the Pope.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=674}}</ref> When the clergy, with reference to the bull, refused to pay, Edward responded with outlawry.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=675}}</ref> Winchelsea was presented with a dilemma, between loyalty to the king and upholding the papal bull, and responded by leaving it to every individual clergyman to pay as he saw fit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=417}}</ref> By the end of the year a solution was offered by the new papal bull ''[[Etsi de statu]]'', which allowed clerical taxation in cases of pressing urgency.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=430}}</ref>

Opposition from the laity took longer to surface. This resistance focused on two things: the king's right to demand military service, and his right to levy taxes. At the Salisbury parliament of February 1297, [[Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk|Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk]], in his capacity as [[Earl Marshal|Marshal of England]], objected to a royal summons of military service. Bigod argued that the military obligation only extended to service alongside the king; if the king intended to sail to Flanders, he could not send his subjects to Gascony.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1972|p=251}}</ref> In July, Bigod and [[Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford|Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford]] and [[Lord High Constable of England|Constable of England]], drew up a series of complaints known as the [[Remonstrances]], where objections to the extortionate level of taxation were voiced.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harriss|1975|p=61}}.</ref> Undeterred, Edward requested another lay subsidy. This one was particularly provocative, because the king had sought consent only from a small group of magnates, rather than from representatives from the communities in parliament.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=422}}</ref> While Edward was in [[Winchelsea]], preparing for the campaign in Flanders, Bigod and Bohun turned up at the Exchequer to prevent the collection of the tax.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=682}}</ref> As the king left the country with a highly reduced force, the kingdom seemed to be on the verge of civil war.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=425}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=683}}</ref> What resolved the situation was the English defeat by the Scots at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]].

Edward's problems with the opposition did not end with the Falkirk campaign. Over the following years he would be held up to the promises he had made, in particular that of upholding the Charter of the Forest.<ref>A full text of the charter, with additional information, can be found at: {{cite web|url=http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/forests/Carta.htm|title=The Charter of the Forest of King Henry III|last=Jones|first=Graham|publisher=[[St John's College, Oxford]]|accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref> In the parliament of 1301 the king was forced to order an assessment of the [[royal forest]]s, but in 1305 he obtained a papal bull that freed him from this concession.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=525&ndash;6, 547&ndash;8}}</ref> Ultimately it was a failure in personnel that spelt the end of the opposition against Edward I. Bohun died late in 1298, after returning from the Falkirk campaign.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=697}}</ref> As for Bigod, in 1302 he arrived at a agreement with the king that was beneficial for both: Bigod, who had no children, made Edward his heir, in return for a generous annual grant.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=537&ndash;8}}</ref> Edward finally got his revenge on Winchelsea in 1305, when [[Pope Clement V|Clement V]] was elected pope.

===Final years: return to Scotland===

The situation in Scotland had seemed resolved when Edward left the country in 1296, but resistance soon emerged under the leadership of the strategically gifted and charismatic [[William Wallace]]. On 11 September 1297, a large English force under the leadership of [[John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey|John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey]], and [[Hugh de Cressingham]] was routed by a much smaller Scottish army led by Wallace and [[Andrew Moray]] at [[Battle of Stirling Bridge|Stirling Bridge]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Barrow|1965|pp=123&ndash;6}}</ref> The defeat sent shockwaves into England, and preparations for a retaliatory campaign started immediately. Soon after Edward returned from Flanders, he headed north.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=688&ndash;9}}</ref> On 22 July 1298, in the only major battle he had fought since Evesham in 1265, Edward defeated Wallace's forces at the [[Battle of Falkirk (1298)|Battle of Falkirk]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=479}}</ref> Edward, however, was not able to take advantage of the momentum, and the next year the Scots managed to recapture [[Stirling Castle]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Watson|1998|pp=92&ndash;3}}</ref> Even though Edward campaigned in Scotland both in 1300 and 1301, the Scots refused to engage in open battle again, preferring instead to raid the English countryside in smaller groups.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=233}}</ref> The English managed to subdue the country by other means, however. In 1303 a peace agreement was reached between England and France, effectively breaking up the Franco-Scottish alliance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=497}}</ref> [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]], the grandson of the claimant to the crown in 1291, had sided with the English in the winter of 1301&ndash;02.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=496}}</ref> By 1304 most of the other nobles of the country had also pledged their allegiance to Edward, and this year the English also managed to re-take Stirling Castle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=709&ndash;11}}</ref> A great propaganda victory was achieved in 1305, when William Wallace was captured by his own, and turned over to the English, who had him taken to London where he was publicly executed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Watson|1998|pp=211&ndash;}}</ref> With Scotland largely under English control, Edward installed Englishmen and turncoat Scots to govern the country.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=711&ndash;3}}</ref>

The situation changed again on 10 February 1306, when Robert the Bruce murdered his rival [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]] and few weeks later, on 25 March, had himself crowned king of Scotland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barrow|1965|pp=206&ndash;7, 212&ndash;3}}</ref> Bruce now embarked on a campaign to restore Scottish independence, and this campaign took the English by surprise.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=506}}</ref> Edward was suffering ill health by this time, and instead of leading an expedition himself, he gave different military commands to [[Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Aymer de Valence]] and [[Henry de Percy, 1st Baron Percy|Henry Percy]], while the main royal army would be led by the Prince of Wales.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=506&ndash;7}}</ref> The English initially met with success; on 19 June Aymer de Valence routed Bruce at the [[Battle of Methven]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Barrow|1965|p=216}}</ref> Bruce was forced into hiding while the English forces recaptured their lost territory and castles.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=507&ndash;8}}</ref> Edward responded with severe brutality against Bruce's allies, it was clear that he now regarded the struggle not as a war between two nations, but as the suppression of a rebellion of disloyal subjects.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=508&ndash;9}}</ref> This brutality though, rather than helping to subdue the Scots, had the opposite effect, and rallied growing support for Bruce.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=239}}</ref> In February Bruce reappeared and started gathering men, and in May he defeated Aymer de Valence at the [[Battle of Loudoun Hill]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Barrow|1965|p=244}}</ref> Edward, who had rallied somewhat, now moved north himself. On the way, however, he developed dysentery, and his condition deteriorated. On 6 July he encamped at [[Burgh by Sands]], just south of the Scottish border. When his servants came the next morning to lift him up so that he could eat, he died in their arms.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=556&ndash;7}}</ref>

Various stories emerged about Edward<U+2019>s deathbed wishes; according to one tradition, he requested that his heart be carried to the Holy Land, along with an army to fight the infidels. A more dubious story tells of how he wished for his bones be carried along on future expeditions against the Scots. Another account of his death bed scene is more credible; according to one chronicle, Edward gathered around him the earls of [[Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln|Lincoln]] and [[Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick|Warwick]], Aymer de Valence and [[Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford|Robert Clifford]], and charged them with looking after his son Edward. In particular they should make sure that Piers Gaveston was not allowed to return to the country.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=557}}</ref> This wish, however, the son ignored, and had his favourite recalled from exile almost immediately.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=377}}</ref> Edward I's body was brought south, and after a lengthy vigil he was buried in Westminster Abbey on 27 October. The new king, Edward II, remained in the north until August, but then abandoned the campaign and headed south.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barrow|1965|p=246}}</ref> He was crowned king on 25 February 1308.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=179}}</ref>

==Character and assessment==
Physically, Edward was an imposing man; at 6&nbsp;foot 2&nbsp;inches he towered over most of his contemporaries. He also had a reputation for a fierce temper, and he could be intimidating; one story tells of how the [[List of Deans of St Paul's|Dean of St Paul's]], wishing to confront Edward over the high level of taxation in 1295, fell down and died once he was in the king's presence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=177}}</ref> This fear was not unwarranted; Edward could have a violent temper. When Edward of Caernarfon demanded an earldom for his favourite Gaveston, the king erupted in anger and supposedly tore out handfuls of his son's hair.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=552}}</ref> Some of his contemporaries consideredsaw Edward unreliable, particularly in his early days. The ''Song of Lewes'' in 1264 described him as a leopard, an animal regarded as particularly shifty and deceitful.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=24}}</ref> Despite these negative character traits, however, Edward's contemporaries considered him an able, even an ideal, king.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=559}}</ref> Though not loved by his subjects, he was feared and respected.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1980|p=41}}</ref> He met contemporary expectations of kingship in his role as an able, determined soldier and in his embodiment of shared chivalric ideals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1980|p=37}}</ref> In religious observance he also fulfilled the expectations of his age: he attended chapel regularly and gave [[alms]] generously.<ref name="DNB"/>

[[File:Bishop William Stubbs.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Bishop [[William Stubbs]], in his ''Constitutional History'' (1873&ndash;78), emphasised Edward I's contribution to the English constitution.]]
Modern historians have been more divided in their view of Edward I. Bishop [[William Stubbs]], working in the [[Whig history|whig]] tradition of historical writing, praised Edward as a king deliberately working towards the goal of a [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional government]]. "...the self-regulating action of the body politic", according to Stubbs "was very much the work of Edward."<ref>{{Harvnb|Stubbs|1880|p=111}}</ref> Stubbs' student [[Thomas Frederick Tout|T. F. Tout]] departed from this view. In Tout's opinion, "Even the parliamentary system grew up in obedience to the royal will. It was no yielding to a people crying for liberty, but the shrewd device of an autocrat, anxious to use the mass of the people as a check upon his hereditary foes among the greater baronage."<ref>{{cite book|last=Tout|first=T.F.|authorlink=Thomas Frederick Tout|title=Chapters in the Administrative History of Mediaeval England: The Wardrobe, the Chamber and the Small Seals|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|date=1920|volume=ii|pages=190}}</ref> [[F. M. Powicke]] offered a more positive perspective in his extensive work on Edward I in ''King Henry III and the Lord Edward'' (1947) and ''The Thirteenth Century'' (1953).<ref name="DNB"/> [[K. B. McFarlane]], on the other hand, criticised Edward's restrictive policy towards his earls, and concluded that "<U+2026>he belonged less to the future than to the past."<ref>{{cite book|first=K.B.|last=McFarlane|authorlink=K. B. McFarlane|title=The Nobility of Later Medieval England|publisher=Hambledon|location=London|year=1981|page=267|isbn=0950688258}}</ref>

In 1988, [[Michael Prestwich]] released what has been called "<U+2026>the first scholarly study devoted exclusively to the political career of Edward I."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Denton|first=J.H.|year=1989|title=Review: Edward I, by Michael Prestwich|journal=[[English Historical Review]]|volume=xcix|pages=pp. 981&ndash;4|accessdate=2009-08-03|format=subscription required|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/572793}}</ref> Prestwich's work, which is considered authoritative,<ref>{{Harvnb|Carpenter|2003|p=566}}</ref> tries to assess Edward by the standards of his own age, and concludes that his reign was a great one.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=567}}</ref> His contributions to the development of the law, parliament and a functioning system of taxation, as well as his military exploits, stand out in particular.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=558&ndash;65}}</ref> At the same time, he left a legacy of financial difficulties, political distrust and an unresolved situation in Scotland. The roots of the disasters of the reign of Edward II can be found in the reign of Edward I.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=565&ndash;6}}</ref> Other contemporary writers have been more willing to criticise Edward for his failings, particularly his severe treatment of the Jews.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=170&ndash;1}}</ref> There is also a great difference between English and Scottish historiography on King Edward. [[G. W. S. Barrow]], in his biography on Robert the Bruce, accused Edward of ruthlessly exploiting the leaderless state of Scotland to obtain a feudal superiority over the kingdom.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barrow|1965|p=44}}</ref> This view of Edward is reflected in the popular perception of the king, as can be seen e.g. in the 1995 movie ''[[Braveheart]]'''s portrayal of the king as a hard-hearted tyrant.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/jul/30/3|title=Braveheart: dancing peasants, gleaming teeth and a cameo from Fabio|last=Tunzelmann|first=Alex von|date=2008-07-31|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref>

==Name and epithets==
[[Edward]], being an Anglo-Saxon name, was not a common name among the aristocracy of England after the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman Conquest]]. Henry III was devoted to the [[veneration]] of [[Edward the Confessor]], and for this reason decided to name his firstborn son after the saint.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=David|authorlink=David Carpenter (historian)|date=2007|title=King Henry III and Saint Edward the Confessor: the origins of the cult|journal=English Historical Review|volume=cxxii|pages=pp. 865&ndash;91}}</ref> Though the first post-Conquest king to carry that name, Edward I was not the first English king named Edward; he was preceded by the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kings [[Edward the Elder]], [[Edward the Martyr]], and [[Edward the Confessor]]. Numerals, however, were not commonly used in Edward's time; the king was referred to simply as "King Edward", "King Edward, son of King Henry", or "King Edward, the first by that name after the Conquest". It was only after the succession of first his son and then his grandson{{ndash}} both of whom bore the same name{{ndash}} that "Edward I" came into common usage.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=xv&ndash;xvi}}</ref>

[[File:Tomb of Edward.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Edward I, from an illustration made when the tomb was opened in 1774.]]
The [[epithet]] under which Edward I is best known is probably "Longshanks"{{ndash}} meaning "long legs" or "long shins"{{ndash}} in reference to his tall stature. On 2 May 1774, the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] opened Edward's tomb in Westminster Abbey. They reported that his body had been well preserved over the preceding 467 years, and measured the king's body to be 6&nbsp;feet 2&nbsp;inches (188&nbsp;cm).<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=566&ndash;7}}. The original report can be found in {{cite journal|last=Ayloffe|first=J.|date=1786|title=An Account of the Body of King Edward the First, as it appeared on opening his Tomb in the year 1774|journal=Archeologia|volume=iii|pages=pp. 386, 398&ndash;412}}</ref> At this length, he would tower over most of his contemporaries.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carpenter|2003|p=467}}</ref> Another epithet applied to Edward I is "Hammer of the Scots". This comes from the  [[Latin]] inscription on his tomb, which reads ''Edwardus Primus Scottorum Malleus hic est, 1308. Pactum Serva'' ("Here is Edward I, Hammer of the Scots, 1308. Keep Faith"). This inscription, however, referring to his incessant campaigns against the Scots in the later years of his reign, is from a later date, probably the sixteenth century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=566}}</ref> The seventeenth-century lawyer Edward Coke called Edward the "English Justinian". This was a way of highlighting the king's legislative accomplishments, by comparing him to the renowned [[Byzantine]] law-maker [[Justinian I]]. Unlike Justinian, Edward did not [[Codification (law)|codify]] the law, but as [[William Stubbs]]  pointed out, "if it be meant to denote the importance and permanence of his legislation and the dignity of his position in legal history",  the comparison is still a valid one.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stubbs|1880|p=114}}</ref>

==Issue==
Eleanor of Castile died on 28 November 1290. Edward was very devoted to his queen, and was deeply affected by her death. He displayed his grief by erecting twelve so-called [[Eleanor cross]]es, one at each place where her funeral cort<U+00E8>ge stopped for the night.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=230&ndash;1}}</ref> As part of the peace accord between England and France in 1294, it was agreed that Edward should marry the French princess [[Marguerite of France (born 1282)|Marguerite]]. The marriage took place in 1299.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=395&ndash;6}}</ref>

Edward and Eleanor had at least fourteen children, perhaps as many as sixteen. Of these, five daughters survived into adulthood, but only one boy outlived Edward{{ndash}} the future King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]. Edward I was reportedly concerned with his son's failure to live up the expectations of an heir to the crown, and at one point decided to exile the prince's favourite Piers Gaveston.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=719}}</ref> By Marguerite Edward had two sons, both of whom lived into adulthood, and a daughter who died as a child.<ref>The information on Edward's children with Eleanor is based on {{cite journal|last=Parsons|first=John Carmi|date=1984|title=The Year of Eleanor of Castile's Birth and her Children by Edward I|journal=Medieval Studies|volume=XLVI|pages=pp. 245&ndash;65}}</ref>
