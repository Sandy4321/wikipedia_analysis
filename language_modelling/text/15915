'''Martha Jane MacKenzie''' (n<U+00E9>e '''Stewart''', previously '''Holden''') is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] from the Australian [[Channel Seven]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Home and Away]]'', played by [[Jodi Gordon]]. Martha made her first on-screen appearance on 8 September 1988.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Episode 169|series=Home and Away|serieslink=Home and Away|credits=''Home and Away'' cast, Tina Butler (director), Sue Hore (writer)|network=[[Seven Network]]|airdate=8 September 1988|season=1|number=169}}</ref> She was originally played by Burcin Kapkin until her departure in 1989. In 2005, the character returned to ''Home and Away'', played by Jodi Gordon. Gordon was a model and she took acting lessons before auditioning for the role. Gordon won a [[Logie Award]] for "Most Popular New Female Talent" in 2006 and she earned several more award nominations for her portrayal of Martha.

Martha was described as being friendly, feisty and fun loving. Martha's appearance has evolved through out her time in the show: she was initially a [[tomboy]] who loved sport, but she later became a stylish woman. Martha's storylines saw her surviving a helicopter crash, having an abortion and a miscarriage, battling [[alcoholism]], being diagnosed with breast cancer and becoming a widow after her husband was shot. In a controversial storyline Martha worked as a pole dancer; the scenes were criticised by the broadcasting regulator for their content. Whilst playing Martha, Gordon was at the center of a number of personal scandals, which put her future in the show in doubt. In January 2010, it was announced that Gordon was leaving the show and Martha departed on 9 June 2010.<ref>{{Cite episode|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/spoilers/a223121/5093-angelo-and-charlie-finally-overcome-eaves.html|title=Episode 5093|series=Home and Away|serieslink=Home and Away|credits=''Home and Away'' cast, Danny Raco (director), James Walker (writer)|network=[[Seven Network]]|airdate=9 June 2010|season=23|number=5093<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uHWrgE8k|archivedate=16 November 2010 -->}}</ref>

==Character development==
===Characterisation===
Channel Seven described Martha as being "Friendly, straight down the line, and with a great enthusiasm for life",<ref name="yahoo">{{Cite web|title=Martha MacKenzie <U+2013> Yahoo!7 TV|url=http://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/cast/article/-/article/5190972/martha-mackenzie/|work=[[Channel Seven]]|publisher=([[Yahoo]])|accessdate=7 July 2010<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uHXb5na1|archivedate=16 November 2010 -->}}</ref> and ''Jetstar'' magazine called Martha "a feisty addition to the Stewart family".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jetstarmag.com/story/home-is-where-the-heart-is/560/1/|title=Home is Where the Heart is|date=January 2009|work=Jetstar|publisher=[[Jetstar Airways]]/Ink Publishing|first=Kylie|last=Miller|accessdate=7 July 2010<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uHXdptzW|archivedate=16 November 2010 -->}}</ref> Gordon described Martha's persona stating: "Martha's pretty feisty all of the time but in the sense of always fighting for what's right and keeping up a strong perspective on where I want to go, things like that."<ref name="d"/> Gordon says that she feels Martha always makes bad choices when it comes to her love life, because she never knows what she wants.<ref name="wot"/> Gordon said that Martha is "messed up" but with a "warm side" to her persona, and that overall Martha is "fun loving, easy going girl-next-door" type character.<ref name="wot">{{Cite web|title=WOTV: Home and Away star Jodi Gordon talks about Martha (video)|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/video/youtube/video/u1yIRS_h7AE&feature=youtube_gdata|work=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[IPC Media]])|accessdate=14 July 2010|year=2007<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uHXhPCaa|archivedate=16 November 2010 -->}}</ref> Of her portrayal, Gordon says that she enjoys the challenge of playing Martha because she gets to shout a lot when showing her crazy and fun side.<ref name="wut"/> Gordon later said that "There will always be a little bit of trouble attached to Martha. She will always be a little bit mischievous".<ref name="Steamy"/> On the character's appearance, ''[[RTE]]'' said "Martha was a self-confessed tomboy, loving sport and anything physical. Now she has grown into a stylish woman with great taste in clothes which range from shorts and strappy tops to gorgeous summer dresses."<ref name="RTECharacters">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/homeandaway/character_marthamackenzie.html|title=Home and Away Characters <U+2013> Martha MacKenzie|work=RTE Television|publisher=[[RTE]]|accessdate=5 July 2010<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uHXkF7b6|archivedate=16 November 2010 -->}}</ref>

===Relationship with Jack Holden===
Most of Martha's storylines were central to her on-off relationship with [[Jack Holden]] ([[Paul O'Brien]]). Viewers saw the couple go through marriage, divorce, a second marriage and Martha being widowed. [[Holy Soap]] said that Martha and Jack proved to be one of the "best loved couples", before they married for the first time.<ref name="Moments">{{Cite web|url=http://holysoap.five.tv/homeandaway/pictures/marthas-moments-7877/images/13205?slider_page=1|title=Martha's moments!|work=[[Holy Soap]]|publisher=[[Five (TV channel)|Five]]|accessdate=26 September 2010<!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5t2gyI7Mg|archivedate=26 September 2010 -->}}</ref> However, their marriage does not last long and they split.<ref name="Moments"/> Martha and Jack start to lead separate lives, but Jack is there for Martha after she has an abortion. Martha is feeling low at this point and kisses him; Jack's girlfriend [[Sam Holden (Home and Away)|Sam Tolhurst]] ([[Jessica Chapnik]]) sees this.<ref name="yah"/> O'Brien stated: "I think Jack felt like 'Oh this is nice, but I've moved on, I've finally moved on and found someone', but deep down he still wants Martha."<ref name="yah"/> Martha is left "shattered" after Jack plans to marry Sam. Martha was caught trying on Sam's wedding dress as she tried to figure out if she still had feelings for Jack.<ref name="Steamy"/> Gordon said that from day one, Jack and Martha have wanted to be together, but "they're never in the same headspace".<ref name="Steamy"/> O'Brien added that he believes Jack was always in love with Martha, even whilst with he was in a relationship with Sam. Both O'Brien and Gordon agreed that when Jack and Martha first broke up it was a bad time for Jack, as his life was spiraling out of control, he needed her, but she left him when he needed her the most.<ref name="yah"/> They later become friends; O'Brien believed it was hard to understand how Jack could be so forgiving toward her.<ref name="yah"/>

Although the characters were separated on screen, they had gained a fan base on the Internet that believed Martha should be with Jack and wanted the pair to reunite.<ref name="wut"/> Gordon herself backed the pairing, stating that she believed they should be together. She said: "I actually love Jack and Martha together, I'm a sucker for romance so, I want want them to be together [...] I want them to continue on, [...] the timing is not right, they are not mature enough. Jack's in a relationship with someone else as Martha is, there just seems to be things getting in the way of them getting back together all the time."<ref name="wut"/> Gordon also hoped for a happy ending for the two characters if they were to ever leave the serial adding: "If I had it my way, and I got to write the scripts then I'd make it happily ever after, Martha and Jack riding off into the sunset."<ref name="wut"/> Gordon has spoke of her understanding from the audiences point of view, that together Jack and Martha are "the ultimate couple".<ref name="d"/> She also reiterated her belief that it would be to tough at the time of Martha's downward spiral for them to work together, but if Martha is to get through her troubles and have a happy ending, that it would be with Jack.<ref name="d"/> ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' commented on the Martha and Jack situation, saying it is played out in a "classic soapie technique". They said "Bring the characters together, push them apart, but always leave open the possibility that they could get back together. It has worked for ''[[Days Of Our Lives]]<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' John Black and Marlena Evans".<ref name="Steamy"/>

On-screen Jack and Martha later reconcile, after he helps her through her hard times. Gordon believed that their relationship was at its strongest peak whilst Martha had breast cancer. She added that Martha would do anything to avoid jeopardising their happiness.<ref name="baby"/>

===Downward spiral and pole dancing===
One of the most notable story lines for Martha was her secret life as a [[pole dancer]] and subsequent road into alcoholism. This was a result of her abortion and failed relationships with Jack and Ash Nader ([[Ben Geurens]]) along with her new relationship with Cameron (Cam) Reynolds (Ashley Lyons), who was leading her astray.<ref name="wot"/> The story line began playing out from the 2006 "cliffhanger" episode, when Ash reveals that he is married with children and leading a double life.<ref name="party">{{Cite web|last=Downie|first=Stephen|title=Role grows more varied |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/entertainment/tv/role-grows-more-varied/story-e6freqj6-1111112883371|work=[[The Courier-Mail]]|publisher=([[News Limited]])|accessdate=14 July 2010|date=23 January 2007<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uHXqM6mS|archivedate=16 November 2010 -->}}</ref> Gordon branded Martha as ignorant to the situation she has got herself into: "I think she is so naive, she wants to believe that she's found a great guy and she keeps giving him second chances. She wants to make it work."<ref name="party"/> Martha fails to cope with the situation, as Gordon describes: "It's this whole emotional roller-coaster that, if you don't deal with your life, can be terrible."<ref name="party"/> Their relationship falls apart after Martha aborts Ash's child, causing Martha to begin her transition into a party girl. Gordon commented that "I think everyone in this show begins as a scruffy bum and gradually they turn you into a glamour puss."<ref name="party"/>

[[File:Martha MacKenzie Dancer.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Martha pole dancing, a notable storyline and a scene that caused outrage in Australia for its G rated content. (2007)]]
Gordon pointed out that Martha was not stripping, just pole dancing. Gordon took pole dancing lessons for a period of a few weeks funded by Channel Seven, and found the experience embarrassing and physically challenging.<ref name="wot"/><ref name="d"/> She found it hard dancing in front of her fellow cast members, commenting that "There's even one scene when all of the boys turn up at the club and they're looking at me <U+2013> it's like having your mates seeing you half naked. It's not very nice, a bit intimidating but it's always exciting to have a challenging story line like that. It's worth while in the end knowing that you've put everything into it."<ref name="d"/> Gordon believed that the storyline was a turning point in Martha's development, as she has to hit rock bottom to realise who she is and what she really wants from life.<ref name="d"/>

After everyone finds out about Martha's situation, they try to stop her working in the club. [[Kate Ritchie]] who plays on-screen friend [[Sally Fletcher]] discussed how Martha would not take any advice from those closest to her and how Sally and Alf have to pick up the pieces for her in the end.<ref name="kr">{{Cite web|last=Kimberley|first=Dadds|title=Soaps <U+2013> Interviews <U+2013> Kate Ritchie|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/interviews/a66375/kate-ritchie.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=7 July 2010|date=14 August 2007<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uHXycx27|archivedate=16 November 2010 -->}}</ref> She compared Martha's pole dancing to many real life experiences ordinary people go through.<ref name="kr"/> Sally's interference made Martha's situation worse, of this Ritche added: "It's been hard for Sally to realise and Alf as well, just that you just have to stand back and let it run its course and be there at the end."<ref name="kr"/> Of Martha's downward spiral and pushing her friends away, Gordon stated: "Now she's found herself in this hole, she ruined all these relationships with her family, her friends, Jack, everyone's trying to help her and she's really against everyone, she's in a really bad place at the moment".<ref name="wot"/>

The broadcast scenes proved to be controversial in Australia after broadcasting regulator [[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]] felt the scenes featured sexual content. They noted that "ACMA determined that pole-dancing scenes contained in the programmes contained visual depictions of sexual behaviour, that their impact was higher than very mild, and that the episodes were not suitable for children to watch without supervision."<ref name="acma">{{Cite web|last=Daniel|first=Kilkelly|title='Home and Away' rapped by regulator|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a77169/home-and-away-rapped-by-regulator.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=8 July 2010|date=6 October 2007<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uHY2VqI8|archivedate=16 November 2010 -->}}</ref> Channel Seven defended the scenes and stated that where as most episodes of the serial are [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia)#Recommendations|PG rated]] they would take extra care to inform viewers of G rated episodes and to include material more suitable for children.<ref name="acma"/> Two years after the storyline aired, Gordon was reported to be a regular visitor to strip clubs as a result of her earlier visits whilst filming the storyline.<ref name="sa">{{Cite web|title=Jodi Gordon Home And Away pole-dancing got her into strip clubs |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/confidential/jodi-gordon-home-and-away-pole-dancing-got-her-into-strip-clubs/story-e6fredq3-1225746653107|work=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]|publisher=([[News Limited]])|accessdate=13 July 2010|date=6 July 2009<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uHY4zyfW|archivedate=16 November 2010 -->}}</ref>

===Pregnancy and breast cancer===
In 2008, viewers saw Martha coming to terms with a second pregnancy. The storyline began after Martha left old boyfriend Roman Harris ([[Conrad Coleby]]) for Jack. She was unsure of the child's paternity, but kept it a secret from Jack. Gordon said this is "Because she doesn't think he ever needs to know. Roman's said he doesn't want to be involved and he wants to say it's Jack's. And so does Martha..."<ref name="baby">{{Cite web|title=Who's the daddy of Martha's baby?|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/home-and-away/interviews/whos-the-daddy-of-marthas-baby/3750|work=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=([[IPC Media]])|accessdate=13 July 2010|date=1 August 2008<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uHY9RBfi|archivedate=16 November 2010 -->}}</ref> After Martha has a miscarriage scare, Roman wanted to know if the baby was his. Gordon explained that "Roman says he needs to know if he is or isn't the baby's father and Martha has to agree to do a DNA test. [...] They wait till Jack's out of the room then quickly arrange it.
