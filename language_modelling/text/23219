'''Resveratrol''' is a [[phytoalexin]] produced naturally by several [[plant]]s when under attack by [[bacteria]] or [[fungi]]. Phytoalexins are antibacterial and anti-fungal chemicals produced by plants as a defense against infection by [[pathogen]]s. Resveratrol has also been produced by chemical synthesis,<ref name="pmid16401555">{{cite journal

==Chemical and physical properties==
Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a [[polyphenol]]ic [[phytoalexin]]. It is a [[stilbenoid]], a derivate of [[stilbene]], and is produced in plants with the help of the [[enzyme]] stilbene synthase. 

It exists as two [[structural isomer]]s: ''cis-'' (''Z'') and ''trans-'' (''E''), with the ''trans''-isomer shown in the top image. ''Trans''-resveratrol can undergo isomerisation to the ''cis-'' form when heated or exposed to [[ultraviolet]] irradiation.<ref>{{cite journal

==Plants and foods==
Resveratrol is produced by several plants, apparently due to its [[antifungal drug|antifungal]] properties. It is found in widely varying amounts in [[grape]]s (primarily the skins), [[raspberry|raspberries]], [[mulberry|mulberries]], in [[plums]], [[peanut]]s, [[berries]] of [[Vaccinium]] species, including [[blueberries]], [[bilberries]], and [[cranberry|cranberries]], some [[pine]]s, such as [[Scots pine]] and [[eastern white pine]], and the roots and stalks of giant knotweed and [[Japanese knotweed]], called ''hu zhang'' in [[China]]. Resveratrol was first isolated from an extract of the [[Peruvian]] [[legume]] ''[[Cassia (genus)|Cassia]] quinquangulata'' in 1974. 

The amount of resveratrol in food varies greatly. Ordinary non-[[muscadine]] [[Red wine]] contains between 0.2 and 5.8 mg/L,<ref name=Gu> Gu X, Creasy L, Kester A, et al., Capillary electrophoretic determination of resveratrol in wines.  J Agric Food Chem 47:3323-3277, 1999</ref> depending on the grape variety, while white wine has much less <U+2014> the reason being that red wine is [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] with the skins, allowing the wine to absorb the resveratrol, whereas [[white wine]] is fermented after the skin has been removed. Wines produced from [[muscadine]] grapes, however, both red and white, may contain more than 40 mg/L.<ref name=Ector>Ector BJ, Magee JB, Hegwood CP, Coign MJ., [http://www.ajevonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/47/1/57 Resveratrol Concentration in Muscadine Berries, Juice, Pomace, Purees, Seeds, and Wines.]</ref><ref name="LeBlanc"/>

Fresh grape skin contains about 50 to 100 micrograms of resveratrol per gram.<ref name=Ref2>http://www.mercola.com/2004/jun/9/grape_skin.htm</ref>

In grapes, resveratrol is found primarily in the skin and seeds.  This is particularly true for muscadine grapes, whose skin and seeds have about 100 times the concentration as the pulp.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-01202006-082858/ |title=Cultivar, Juice Extraction, Ultra Violet Irradiation and Storage Influence the Stilbene Content of Muscadine Grapes (Vitis Rotundifolia Michx.) |accessdate=2007-08-15 |last=LeBlanc |first=Mark Rene |date=2005-12-13 }}</ref> The amount found in grape skins also varies with the grape cultivar, its geographic origin, and exposure to fungal infection. The amount of fermentation time a wine spends in contact with grape skins is an important determinant of its resveratrol content.<ref name=PNS>Roy, H., Lundy, S., [http://www.pbrc.edu/Division_of_Education/pdf/PNS_resveratrol.pdf Resveratrol], Pennington Nutrition Series, 2005 No. 7</ref>

== Supplement ==
Resveratrol is available as a [[nutritional supplement]] but not as a therapeutic agent (although it has been registered as an investigational drug in some jurisdictions). Supplements, first sourced from ground dried [[muscadine]] and red grape skins and seeds (sometimes from residual byproducts of winemaking),<ref name=Ref11>{{cite journal

}}</ref> are now primarily derived from the cheaper, more concentrated [[Japanese knotweed]].  Capsules are sold containing from 1&nbsp;mg to 500&nbsp;mg of resveratrol. A less common form is plain powder, which might be more convenient for frequent ingestion as suggested by the rapid metabolism in the body. 

Although no studies have yet appeared regarding proper dosage of Resveratrol for humans, Sirtris Pharmaceuticals along with David Sinclair, have taken to use a dosage of 2500&nbsp;mg and 5000&nbsp;mg of their resveratrol supplement formulation for their phase 1b human trials, and have recently completed phase 1a trials using the formulation.<ref name=Sirtris>Sirtris IPO Info,[http://www.revgenetics.com/sirtris.htm]</ref>

Some supplement makers claim that only the ''trans-'' form matters, and that the ''cis-'' form is not useful or perhaps even a bad thing. Other makers simply report total resveratrol content -- or in some cases, just the quantity of an "extract" source, which only contains some percentage of resveratrol.

The following is an excerpt from a FDA New Dietary Ingredient Notification:

{{quotation|First, trans-Resveratrol is excluded from the definition of a <U+201C>dietary supplement<U+201D> under 21 U.S.C. 321 (ff) (3) (B), because it is an article authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and made public in the U. S.}}

{{quotation|FDA authorized trans-Resveratrol, which is also known as <U+201C>resveratrol<U+201D> or 3,5,4<U+2019>-trihydroxystilbene, to be an [[Investigational New Drug]] on January 30, 2001. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994 defined a <U+201C>new dietary ingredient<U+201D> as one that was marketed in the U.S. on or after October 15, 1994. This office does not have any information that indicates that trans-Resveratrol was legally marketed as a dietary ingredient in the U.S. before October 15, 1994.}}

Resveratrol is often called a [[nutraceutical]], like other bioactive plant compounds studied for potential clinical applications: [[curcumin]], [[EGCG]], [[silibinin]], etc.

A study by Professor Roger Corder has identified a particular group of [[polyphenols]], known as oligomeric [[Proanthocyanidin|procyanidins]], which they believe offer the greatest degree of protection to human blood-vessel cells.  These are found in greatest concentration in European red wines from certain areas, which correlates with longevity in those regions. This new data may impact the supplement market.<ref name=Corder>R. Corder et al., [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7119/abs/444566a.html Oenology: Red wine procyanidins and vascular health.], Nature vol. 444, p. 566; 30 November 2006.</ref> Because they are present in red wine in more significant quantities, they are a more reasonable explanation of the [[French paradox]] than resveratrol (which would seem to require drinking hundreds of glasses of wine a day to get enough to matter).  Procyanidins are also found in similar quantities in purple grape juice, green tea, dark-colored fruits and high-cocoa chocolate.

==Physiological effects==
===Mechanism of action===
Resveratrol interferes with all three stages of [[carcinogenesis]] - initiation, promotion and progression. Experiments in [[cell cultures]] of varied types and isolated subcellular systems [[in vitro]] imply many mechanisms in the [[pharmacological]] activity of resveratrol. These mechanisms include modulation of the [[transcription factor]] [[NF-kB]],<ref>{{cite journal

In humans resveratrol rapidly undergoes phase II conjugation, both [[glucuronidation]] and sulphation at multiple sites on the molecule.

===Life extension and anti-aging===
Experiments from the Harvard laboratory of [[David Sinclair (Biologist)]] published in 2003 the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] demonstrated that resveratrol significantly extends the lifespan of the [[yeast]] ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''. <ref>Howitz KT, Bitterman KJ, Cohen HY, Lamming DW, Lavu S, Wood JG, Zipkin RE, Chung P, Kisielewski A, Zhang LL, Scherer B, Sinclair DA. "Small molecule activators of sirtuins extend Saccharomyces cerevisiae lifespan". ''Nature''. 2003 Sep 11;425(6954):191-6. Epub 2003 Aug 24. PMID 12939617</ref> Dr. Sinclair then founded Sirtris Pharmaceuticals to commercialize resveratrol or related compounds as an anti-aging drug. 

Later studies showed that resveratrol prolongs the lifespan of the worm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' and the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''.<ref>Wood JG, Rogina B, Lavu1 S, Howitz K, Helfand SL, Tatar M, Sinclair D. "Sirtuin activators mimic caloric restriction and delay ageing in metazoans". ''Nature''. 2004 Aug 5; 430(7000):686-689. Epub 2004 Jul 14. PMID 15254550</ref> In 2006, it also extended the maximum lifespan of a short-lived fish, ''Nothobranchius furzeri'', by 59%, and extended its median lifespan by 56%. Also noted were an increase in swimming performance, an increase in cognitive performance (learning tasks), and a lack of neurofibrillary degeneration (found in a control group). The authors observed that "[resveratrol's] supplementation with food extends vertebrate lifespan and delays motor and cognitive age-related decline could be of high relevance for the prevention of aging-related diseases in the human population."<ref>Valenzano DR, Terzibasi E, Genade T, Cattaneo A, Domenici L, Cellerino A "Resveratrol Prolongs Lifespan and Retards the Onset of Age-Related Markers in a Short-Lived Vertebrate." ''Current Biology'' 2006 Feb 7;16 (3):296-300 PMID 16461283</ref> Later in 2006, a report in the journal Nature by Sinclair's laboratory showed that the compound improves health and survival of mice on a high-calorie diet.<ref>Baur JA, Pearson KJ, Price NL, Jamieson HA, Lerin C, Kalra A, Prabhu VV, Allard JS, Lopez-Lluch G, Lewis K, Pistell PJ, Poosala S, Becker KG, Boss O, Gwinn D, Wang M, Ramaswamy S, Fishbein KW, Spencer RG, Lakatta EG, Le Couteur D, Shaw RJ, Navas P, Puigserver P, Ingram DK, de Cabo R, Sinclair DA. "Resveratrol improves health and survival of mice on a high-calorie diet" ''Nature'' 2006 advanced publication</ref>

The mechanisms of resveratrol's apparent effects on [[life extension]] are not fully understood, but they appear to mimic several of the [[biochemical]] effects of [[calorie restriction]]. This seems to function by means of [[lipase]] inhibition, reducing the absorption of [[fat]] through [[intestine|intestinal]] walls. A new report indicates that resveratrol activates [[SIRT1]] and PGC-1<U+03B1> and improve functioning of the [[mitochondria]].<ref>Cell, Vol 127, 1109-1122, 15 December 2006; Resveratrol Improves Mitochondrial Function and Protects against Metabolic Disease by Activating SIRT1 and PGC-1<U+03B1></ref>

Only the "Trans" form of the molecule is capable of activating the [[mammal]]ian [[SIRT1]] [[gene]] [[in vitro]]; this is also the form predominantly found in red grape skins and red wine. Red grapes grown in some regions (such as New York state) often have much higher concentrations of resveratrol based on the cooler climate and the resulting increase in fungal attacks that promote resveratrol production. However, the amount in any wine, including Muscadine grape wines, is negligible compared to the amount that in theory is needed for health benefits: 1-10 milligrams per liter of wine versus hundreds to thousands of milligrams/day.

Recent research calls into question this theory connecting resveratrol, [[SIRT1]] and [[calorie restriction]].<ref>Kaeberlein M ''et al.'' Sir2-independent life span extension by calorie restriction in yeast. ''PLoS Biol.'' 2004 Sep;2(9):E296. PMID 15328540</ref><ref>Kaeberlein ''et al.'' Substrate-specific activation of sirtuins by resveratrol. ''J Biol Chem.'' 2005 Apr 29; 280(17):17038-45. PMID 15684413.</ref>

Follow up studies by David Sinclair, published in November 2006 by the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], replicated the life extending benefits of resveratrol in mice, the first such demonstration in a mammal.  Preliminary results showed that obese mice provided with resveratrol lived an average of 15% longer than obese mice not provided the supplement.

The amounts used in the mouse study were approximately 22.4 mg/kg body weight per day. Scaling this amount to human body weights would imply an "equivalent human dose" of 1.5 to 2.0 grams/day. Compensating for the fact that humans have slower metabolic rates than mice would change the equivalent human dose to the range of 150 to 200 mg/day if the resveratrol plasma levels in humans were not known and we wanted to predict a human dosage using FDA guidelines.<ref name=FDA_Guides>FDA,[http://www.fda.gov/cber/gdlns/dose.htm#v]</ref> 

The truth is that many differences exist between mouse and human metabolism, and the effects of any given oral dose in humans remain unknown. In 2004, there was a study to determine absorption, bioavailability, and metabolism of Resveratrol in humans. It indicated that Resveratrol was quickly metabolized using 25mg doses in humans.<ref name=USC_Study>{{cite journal

|issn=
}}</ref> Only trace amounts were found in human plasma, and that most of the oral dose was recovered in urine. Mice, on the other hand were found to have much larger amounts of resveratrol measured in their plasma using equivalent doses of resveratrol per kilogram of weight. It was also stated in the study that the systemic bioavailability of resveratrol is very low in humans compared to that of mice, but that accumulation of resveratrol in the human epithelial cells along the aerodigestive tract along with potentially active resveratrol metabolites may still produce cancer-preventive and other effects. Large dosages could theoretically increase the resveratrol in human plasma.

There is no human evidence yet that quantities found in red wine or in standard supplements are sufficient for any health effect.

===Athletic performance===
Johan Auwerx (at the Institute of Genetics and Molecular and Cell Biology in Illkirch, France) and coauthors published an online article in the journal CELL in November 2006. Mice fed resveratrol for 15 weeks had better treadmill endurance than controls. The study supported Sinclair's hypothesis that the effects of resveratrol are indeed due to the activation of SIRT1.

Nicholas Wade's interview-article with Dr. Auwerx<ref name="Red Wine Ingredient Increases Endurance, Study Shows">{{cite journal|title=Red Wine Ingredient Increases Endurance, Study Shows|author=Wade, Nicholas|year=2006|date=November 16 2006|journal=New York Times}}</ref> states that the dose was 400 mg/kg of body weight (much higher than the 22 mg/kg of the Sinclair study). The following excerpts are from that article:

<blockquote>
<U+201C>'Resveratrol makes you look like a trained athlete without the training,' Dr. Auwerx said in an interview." ...
<br /><br />
"Dr. Auwerx attributes this in large part to the significantly increased number of [[mitochondria]] he detected in the muscle cells of treated mice. 
<br /><br />
"'Mitochondria are the organelles in the body<U+2019>s cells that generate energy. With extra mitochondria, the treated mice were able to burn more fat and thus avoid weight gain and decreased sensitivity to insulin,' Dr. Auwerx said. He found their muscle fibers had been remodeled by the drug into the type more prevalent in trained human athletes.
<br /><br />
"Dr. Ronald M. Evans, an expert on the hormonal control of metabolism at the Salk Institute, said the report by Dr. Auwerx<U+2019>s team had 'shown very convincingly that resveratrol improves mitochondrial function' and fends off metabolic disease."
<br /><br />
"The main theory developed by Dr. Guarente and others is that sirtuins sense the level of energy expenditure in living cells and switch the body<U+2019>s resources from reproduction to tissue maintenance when food is low."
</blockquote> 

For an 80 kg (176 lb) person, the 400 mg/kg of body weight amount used in Dr. Auwerx's mouse study would come to 32,000 mg/day. Compensating for the fact that humans have slower metabolic rates than mice would change the equivalent human dose to roughly 4571 mg/day. Again, there is no published evidence anywhere in the scientific literature of any clinical trial for efficacy in humans. There is limited human safety data (see above). It is premature to take resveratrol and expect any particular results. Long-term safety has not been evaluated in humans.

In a study of 123 Finnish adults, those born with certain increased variations of the SIRT1 gene had faster metabolisms, helping them to burn energy more efficiently -- indicating that the same pathway  shown in the lab mice works in humans too. <ref>{{cite journal

===Antiviral effects===
Resveratrol seems to increase the potency of some [[antiretroviral drug]]s against [[HIV]] [[in vitro]].<ref>Heredia A, Davis C, Redfield R. Synergistic inhibition of HIV-1 in activated and resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells, monocyte-derived macrophages, and selected drug-resistant isolates with nucleoside analogues combined with a natural product, resveratrol. ''J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr.'' 2000 Nov 1;25(3):246-55. PMID 11115955</ref>

Infection by [[herpes simplex]] virus ordinarily activates the cell protein [[NF-kB|Nuclear Factor <U+03BA>B]] (NF-<U+03BA>B).  A Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine study undertaken in [[Vero cell]]s found that resveratrol suppresses the activation of this [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]]- and [[apoptosis]]-related protein. The study further found that multiple viral protein products were reduced or completely blocked, as well as a reduction in viral DNA production.<ref>Faith SA, Sweet TJ, Bailey E, Booth T, Docherty JJ.  Resveratrol suppresses nuclear factor-kappaB in herpes simplex virus infected cells.  ''Antiviral research'' 2006 Jul 14 PMID 16876885</ref>

A [[cell culture]] study found that resveratrol blocks the [[influenza virus]] from transporting viral proteins to the viral assembly site, hence restricting its ability to replicate. The effect was 90% when resveratrol was added six hours after infection and continued for 24 hours thereafter.<ref>Palamara AT, Nencioini L, Aquilano K, et al. Inhibition of influenza A virus replication by resveratrol. ''Journal of Infectious Diseases'' May 2005 15;191(10):1719-29. PMID 15838800</ref>

===Adverse effects and unknowns===
While the health benefits of resveratrol seem promising, one study has theorized that it may stimulate the growth of human breast cancer cells, possibly because of resveratrol's chemical structure, which is similar to a [[phytoestrogen]].<ref>Gehm BD, McAndrews JM, Chien P, Jameson JL. Resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound found in grapes and wine, is an agonist for the estrogen receptor. ''Proc. National. Academy of Sciences'' 1997 Dec 9;94(25):14138-43. PMID 9391166</ref> <ref>Bowers JL, Tyulmenkov VV, Jernigan SC, Klinge CM. Resveratrol acts as a mixed agonist/antagonist for estrogen receptors alpha and beta. ''Endocrinology'' 2000 Oct;141(10):3657-67. PMID 11014220</ref> However, other studies have found that resveratrol actually fights breast cancer.<ref>Levi,Pasche,Lucchini,Ghidoni, Ferraroni, La Vecchia. Resveratrol and breast cancer risk. ''European Journal of Cancer Prevention'' 14(2):139-142, April 2005.[http://www.eurjcancerprev.com/pt/re/ejcp/abstract.00008469-200504000-00009.htm;jsessionid=G3GJqVvCY4cg6ply0srM3lxnwdNMhpqkBZGnmS1fksNydvR2h6mX!-170133123!181195628!8091!-1]</ref><ref>Garvina, <U+00D6>llingerb, Dabrosin.Resveratrol induces apoptosis and inhibits angiogenesis in human breast cancer xenografts in vivo. ''Cancer Letters'' Volume 231, Issue 1, 8 January 2006, Pages 113-122.[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T54-4FPYWW1-8&_user=10&_coverDate=01%2F08%2F2006&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=4b11cd83d6581a92cd26debad3e21408]</ref>
Citing the evidence that resveratrol is estrogenic, some retailers of resveratrol advise that the compound may interfere with oral contraceptives and that women who are pregnant or intending to become pregnant should not use the product, while others advise that resveratrol should not be taken by children or young adults under 18, as no studies have shown how it effects their natural development."<ref name="revgenetics">More resveratrol information, ''What is Resveratrol?''.[http://www.revgenetics.com/resveratrol.html]</ref>

Dietician Melissa Q.B. McElderry MS RD comments, "While taking resveratrol pills is certainly safer than heavy consumption of red wine, supplementing with unproven substances is generally unwise. At this point, occasional use of red wine seems far more prudent."<ref name="mcelderry">Melissa Q.B. McElderry MS RD, ''Is this red wine's secret to good health?''. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0GCU/is_5_16/ai_56881798/print available online]</ref>

"Reasons why recommending a population-wide increase would be premature:
Little is known about the absorption and clearance of resveratrol, the identities of its metabolic products, or its effects on the liver. The research on resveratrol has focused on its short-term effects and has been mainly done on non-human models."<ref name=PNS/>
