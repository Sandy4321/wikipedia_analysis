'''Kakury<U+016B> Rikisabur<U+014D>''' (born August 10, 1985 as '''Mangaljalavyn Anand''', {{Lang-mn|<U+041C><U+0430><U+043D><U+0433><U+0430><U+043B><U+0436><U+0430><U+043B><U+0430><U+0432><U+044B><U+043D> <U+0410><U+043D><U+0430><U+043D><U+0434>}}) is a professional [[sumo]] wrestler from  [[S<U+00FC>khbaatar Province]], [[Mongolia]]. He has been a member of the top ''[[makuuchi]]'' division since November [[2006 in sumo|2006]] and has earned nine [[sansho (sumo)|special prizes]], seven for technique, which is the most by any wrestler in any one category. He reached the third highest ''sekiwake'' rank in  July [[2009 in sumo|2009]], and in March [[2012 in sumo|2012]] he secured promotion to the second highest rank of ''<U+014D>zeki'' after finishing runner up to ''[[yokozuna (sumo)|yokozuna]]'' [[Hakuh<U+014D>]] and accumulating a total of 33 wins in his previous three tournaments. After scoring 14 wins against one loss in both of the first two tournaments of 2014, and claiming the ''[[y<U+016B>sh<U+014D>]]'' in the second, he was promoted to ''yokozuna''.<ref name="yokozuna">{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/sports/sumo/AJ201403230025|title=SUMO/ Kakuryu wins first title and likely promotion to yokozuna|date=23 March 2014|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=promoted />

==Career==
Kakury<U+016B> Rikisabur<U+014D> was born August 10, 1985 as Mangaljalavyn Anand.<ref>[http://www.sumo.or.jp/en/sumo_data/rikishi/profile?id=2416 Japan Sumo Association profile]</ref>  His father was a university professor and he grew up dreaming of professional basketball, not sumo.  At age 14, he decided to devote himself to sumo after seeing a tournament featuring fellow Mongolians [[Kyokutenho]] and [[Kyokush<U+016B>zan]] on TV.  He wrote a letter about his desires and had a friend translate it into Japanese.  He then mailed the letter to several stables in Japan.  [[Izutsu stable]]'s head was impressed and invited Kakury<U+016B>  to Japan.<ref name=slow>{{cite news|title=Slow but steady, Kakuryu finally reaches the top|author=Takuta Minoda|work=The Asahi Shimbum|date=March 24, 2014|url=https://ajw.asahi.com/article/sports/sumo/AJ201403240067|accessdate=March 26, 2014}}</ref>  Kakury<U+016B>'s family had no background in [[Mongolian wrestling]], and he had no experience in wrestling before coming to Japan. 

When Kakury<U+016B> joined [[Izutsu stable]], he weighed just {{convert|65|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and his ''[[oyakata]]'' former ''sekiwake'' [[Sakahoko Nobushige|Sakahoko]] joked he was better suited to be the stable's ''tokoyama'' (hairdresser) than a wrestler.<ref name=slow />  Kakury<U+016B> made his professional debut at the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament in November 2001, then weighing {{convert|82|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kakuryu to be promoted to yokozuna|date=March 24, 2014|work=Japan Times|url=http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0001152685|accessdate=March 26, 2014}}</ref><ref name=sumoDB>{{cite web|title=Kakuryu Rikisaburo|url=http://sumodb.sumogames.de/Rikishi.aspx?r=1219|publisher=Sumo Reference|accessdate=March 26, 2014}}</ref> After reaching the fourth highest ''[[sandanme]]'' division fairly quickly, he struggled, being demoted back to ''[[jonidan]]'' twice. After 17 tournaments, he finally won the ''sandanme'' championship in July 2004 with a 7-0 record and earned promotion to the ''[[makushita]]'' division.<ref name=slow />

Kakury<U+016B> first reached ''[[sekitori]]'' status in November 2005 upon promotion to the ''[[j<U+016B>ry<U+014D>]]'' division but fell short with a 5-10 record, dropping back to ''[[makushita]].'' He returned to the second division in March 2006 and reached the top ''[[makuuchi]]'' division that November, after scoring 9 wins at the rank of j<U+016B>ry<U+014D> 1 in the previous tournament.<ref name=sumoDB /> He was the eighth Mongolian to make ''makuuchi'' after [[Kyokushuzan|Kyokush<U+016B>zan]], [[Kyokutenh<U+014D>]], [[Asash<U+014D>ry<U+016B> Akinori|Asash<U+014D>ry<U+016B>]], [[Asasekiry<U+016B>]], [[Hakuh<U+014D>]], [[Harumafuji K<U+014D>hei|Harumafuji]] and [[Tokitenk<U+016B> Yoshiaki|Tokitenk<U+016B>]].<ref name=webpaper /> One of seven wrestlers to be promoted to ''makuuchi'' for that tournament, he made his debut halfway up the ''[[maegashira]]'' ranks at number 8, the highest since [[Miyabiyama]] began at ''maegashira'' 7 in March 1999. He came through with a solid 8-7 record.
 
After a strong 11-4 record in January 2008, which earned him his first ''[[sansh<U+014D> (Sumo)|sansh<U+014D>]]'' for technique, Kakury<U+016B> was promoted to ''maegashira'' 1.<ref name=sumoDB /> He was forced to withdraw during the November 2008 tournament after spraining his knee, marking the first time in his career that he had missed any bouts.{{cn|date=March 2014}} In March 2009 he produced a fine 10-5 record from the ''maegashira'' 1 ranking, defeating three ''<U+014D>zeki''. He won his last eight matches after standing at 2-5 on the seventh day. He was awarded his second Technique Prize.  Kakury<U+016B> made his ''[[san'yaku]]'' debut in the following tournament in May 2009 at the rank of ''komusubi''. In a similar fashion to his previous tournament he recovered from 2-5 down to win seven of his last eight bouts and was rewarded with another Technique Prize.<ref name=sumoDB />

[[File:Sumo May09 Kakuryu.jpg|thumb|left|Kakury<U+016B> in May 2009]]

In July 2009 Kakury<U+016B> was promoted to ''sekiwake''.<ref name=sumoDB /> He was the 144th wrestler to earn the rank, and the first from his stable since [[Terao]] in 1989.<ref name=webpaper>{{cite web|title=Kakuryu Rikisaburo|publisher=Sumo Webpaper|url=http://www.sumo-webpaper.com/Sumo_Beya/Kakuryu/Kakuryu.htm|accessdate=March 26, 2014}}</ref>  He was only able to win five bouts in his ''sekiwake'' debut and fell back to the ''maegashira'' ranks. He responded with a strong 11-4 score, earning his third Technique prize in four tournaments and fourth overall. He returned to the ''sekiwake'' rank for the November tournament and finished with a 7-8 record that kept him in the ''san'yaku'' ranks. Disappointing performances in his next three tournaments saw him slip to ''maegashira'' 6, but he responded by winning eleven bouts in July 2010, finishing as joint runner-up and winning his fifth Technique award. He returned to ''komusubi'' in September 2010 and moved up to ''sekiwake'' in November. On the final day of that tournament, he was defeated by fellow ''sekiwake'' [[Tochi<U+014D>zan Y<U+016B>ichir<U+014D>|Tochi<U+014D>zan]] to finish 7-8.<ref name=sumoDB />

Ranked at ''komusubi'' in the May 2011 "technical examination" tournament, Kakury<U+016B> finished runner-up for the second time with a 12-3 record, winning his sixth Technique prize. Promoted to ''sekiwake'' for the July tournament, he defeated three ''<U+014D>zeki'' and finished 10-5.  In a strong position for possible promotion to ''<U+014D>zeki'', Kakury<U+016B> started that next tournament 3-4.  His final record of 9-6 was insufficient to earn a promotion.<ref name=sumoDB />

In the January 2012 tournament, Kakury<U+016B> defeated ''[[yokozuna (sumo)|yokozuna]]'' Hakuh<U+014D> for the first time, and was awarded his first Outstanding Performance Prize.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sumo: Hakuho denies Baruto perfect record on final day of New Year sumo|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/sports/news/20120123p2g00m0sp084000c.html|publisher=[[Mainichi Daily News]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/64z5wv4CI|archivedate=26 January 2012|date=23 January 2012}}</ref> It was his first victory over a ''yokozuna'' in 27 attempts (previously he had been 0-20 against Hakuh<U+014D> and 0-7 against [[Asashoryu Akinori|Asash<U+014D>ry<U+016B>]]).

In the March 2012 tournament held in Osaka, Kakury<U+016B> defeated Hakuh<U+014D> for the second time in a row on Day 9, and entered the final day of the tournament one win ahead of the ''yokozuna'' at 13<U+2013>1, his only loss thus far being to [[Kisenosato]] on Day 8. However, he was defeated by [[G<U+014D>eid<U+014D> G<U+014D>tar<U+014D>|G<U+014D>eid<U+014D>]], and Hakuh<U+014D>'s defeat of [[Baruto]] ensured a playoff between the two Mongolians. Hakuh<U+014D> gained revenge on Kakury<U+016B> to claim his 22nd tournament title. Although he missed out on his first championship, Kakury<U+016B> received prizes for Outstanding performance and Technique.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sumo: Hakuho rallies to win 22nd career title at spring sumo|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/sports/news/20120326p2g00m0sp027000c.html|publisher=Mainichi Daily News|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66Sa4RPyM|archivedate=26 March 2012|date=26 March 2012}}</ref> Kakury<U+016B> said that inexperience cost him in his playoff against Hakuh<U+014D> and that a tournament victory was "too soon for me."<ref name="seals">{{cite web|title=SUMO/ Kakuryu misses title, but seals ozeki promotion|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/sports/sumo/AJ201203260052|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref>  Kakury<U+016B>'s 33 wins over three tournaments was, however, enough to grant him a promotion to ''<U+014D>zeki''. The promotion marked the first time there were six active ''<U+014D>zeki'' simultaneously.<ref>{{cite web|title=<U+5927><U+95A2><U+9DB4><U+7ADC><U+304C><U+8A95><U+751F><U+3000><U+30E2><U+30F3><U+30B4><U+30EB><U+51FA><U+8EAB><U+3067><U+FF14><U+4EBA><U+76EE>|url=http://www.chugoku-np.co.jp/News/Sp201203280089.html|publisher=Chugoku News|archiveurl=|archivedate=|date=28 March 2012}}</ref> It took him 62 tournaments from his professional debut to make ''<U+014D>zeki'', which was the tenth slowest in sumo history, and the slowest of the nine foreigners who have made the rank.<ref name=kakuryu>{{cite web|title=After 62 basho, Kakuryu wins promotion to ozeki|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/sports/T120328006159.htm|publisher=Daily Yomiuri Online|accessdate=28 March 2012|date=29 March 2012}}</ref>

After an unremarkable 2013, in which scored no better than ten wins in any of the six tournaments, Kakury<U+016B> surprised many observers with a 14<U+2013>1 performance in January 2014, defeating Hakuh<U+014D> in their regulation match and only losing the title in a playoff against him on the final day. It was the fourth runner up title of his career.<ref name=sumoDB />  He followed it up with a 14<U+2013>1 record in March 2014, defeating both Hakuh<U+014D> and Harumafuji en route to the Spring Grand Sumo Tournament title. It was his first top division ''[[y<U+016B>sh<U+014D>]]''.<ref name=promoted /> Having satisfied the minimum requirement of two consecutive championships or "the equivalent", the [[Yokozuna Deliberation Council]] unanimously recommended his promotion on 24 March, which was confirmed by the [[Japan Sumo Association]] on 26 March.<ref name="council">{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2014/03/24/sumo/yokozuna-council-recommends-kakuryu-for-promotion/|title=Yokozuna council recommends Kakuryu for promotion|date=24 March 2014|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref>  Kakury<U+016B> was the first to achieve the rank since Harumafuji in 2012, the fourth Mongolian to do so, the sixth foreign-born ''yokozuna'', and 71st overall.  "I am determined to focus all my efforts to train even harder and be certain to give all my strength not to defile the ''yokozuna'' name," he remarked.<ref name=promoted>{{cite news|title=Sumo: Kakuryu promoted to highest rank of yokozuna|work=Mainici|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20140326p2g00m0sp083000c.html|date=March 26, 2014|accessdate=March 26, 2014}}</ref>

==Fighting style==
Kakury<U+016B> is one of the lightest men currently in the top division at around {{convert|130|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and makes use of his agility by frequently employing ''[[henka]]'' (sidestepping) to outwit his opponents. His three most common winning [[kimarite|techniques]] are ''yori-kiri'', the force out, ''oshi-dashi'', the push out, and ''hataki-komi'', the slap down. He is also fond of ''shitatenage'', the underarm throw.<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=Wins of Kakuryu|publisher=Sumo Reference|url=http://sumodb.sumogames.com/Rikishi_kim.aspx?r=1219|date=|accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref> His favourite grip on his opponents ''[[mawashi]]'' is ''migi-yotsu'', with his left hand outside and right hand inside his opponent's arms.  As a ''yokozuna'', he will perform the ''[[Glossary of sumo terms#dohyo-iri|unryu-gata]]'' style.<ref name=promoted />
