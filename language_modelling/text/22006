He succeeded his father as the head of the [[Fushimi-no-miya]] family in 1875.

== Military career ==
A career army officer, Prince Sadanaru studied [[military tactics]] at the [[<U+00C9>cole Sp<U+00E9>ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr]] in [[France]] and later in [[Germany]] in the 1870s. Upon his return to Japan, he advocated the establishment of a Japanese version of an army [[General Staff]] based on the [[Prussia]]n model. He was promoted to [[major general]] in 1889.

General Prince Fushimi Sadanaru served as a field commander in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894<U+2013>1895), commanding the [[IJA 4th Division]], and landing with his forces in the [[Liaodong Peninsula]], [[China]] in 1894. He subsequently participated in the [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1895)|operation to secure Taiwan]].

He represented [[Emperor Meiji]] at the [[coronation]] of [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia]] on May 26, 1896. In 1898, he was promoted to [[lieutenant general]] and assigned command of the [[Himeji, Hyogo|Himeji]]-based [[IJA 10th Division]]. In 1901, he became commander of the [[IJA 1st Division]].

In 1904, with the start of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] he again landed with his forces in the Liaodong Peninsula. In June, he was promoted to full [[general]], and recalled to Japan to serve on the [[Supreme War Council (Japan)|Supreme War Council]], before being sent by Emperor Meiji on a diplomatic mission to the [[United States]]. After the conclusion of the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]], he was sent to England again on a mission of thanks from the Japanese government for British advice and assistance during the war. During this mission, he also stopped in [[Honolulu]] for a visit with the Japanese community there. In 1909, he was again sent on a diplomatic mission, this time to China. Prince Fushimi also represented Japan at the [[state funeral]] of Great Britain's King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] May 20, 1910. He met with the new [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] at [[Buckingham Palace]].

Prince Fushimi was a close advisor to then-[[Crown Prince]] Yoshihito (later [[Emperor Taish<U+014D>]]). After the death of Emperor Meiji in 1911, he served as [[Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan]] from 1912 to 1915, thus becoming the only imperial prince to have served in that office.

He was promoted to the largely ceremonial rank of [[Field Marshal (Japan)|field marshal]] in 1914, and awarded the Grand Collar of the Supreme [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]] in 1916.

The Prince died of [[influenza]] on February 5, 1923 at his vacation home in [[Ch<U+014D>shi, Chiba]] and was accorded a [[state funeral]]. Dowager Princess Fushimi Toshiko died on January 3, 1930. He was succeeded by his son, [[Admiral of the Fleet (Japan)|Fleet Admiral]] [[Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu]].
