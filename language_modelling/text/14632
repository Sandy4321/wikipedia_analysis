'''''This''''' is an album by [[Peter Hammill]], released on his Fie! label in 1998. There is a large variety in the compositions, ranging from the minimalism of the final song, "The Light Continent", to the rough, almost [[Nadir's Big Chance|Nadir]]-like sound of "Always is Next", the complex "Unrehearsed" and the ballad "Since the Kids". Peter Hammill performed the song "Unrehearsed" live many times. "Nightman" can be heard on the live-album ''[[Veracious]]'' (2006).

== Production and instrumentation ==
The album was recorded, mixed and mastered at Peter Hammill's own studio, Terra Incognita in Bath, between January and July 1998. All instruments were played and all voices sung by Hammill, except for violin and viola by [[Stuart Gordon (musician)|Stuart Gordon]], saxophones and flute by [[David Jackson (rock musician)|David Jackson]], and drums and persussion by [[Manny Elias]]. Hammill himself regards the album as "not in any sense a 'band' disc", and considers "the unifying factors [to be] song and voice rather than instrumentation".<ref name=sofasound>[http://www.sofasound.com/phcds/this3.htm Peter Hammill about ''This'']</ref> The songs are interspersed with small instrumental fragments (according to Hammill, "their presence is essential in order to glue the whole thing together"<ref name=sofasound/>).

== Cover ==
The cover shows a tree stump and a collection of objects, signifying the passing of time. There is a tachograph disc, ripped out of the machine at high speed on one of the tours, and a picture of a wrist watch that used to belong to Hammill's father.<ref name=sofasound/> The design was done by RidArt (Paul Ridout).

== Reception ==
As with many Peter Hammill albums of this period, the music press did not take much notice of ''This''. There is still no Allmusic.com review of the album online.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:difyxzqsld0e Allmusic page about ''This'']</ref>
