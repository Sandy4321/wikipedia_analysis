'''State capitalism''', for [[Marxism|Marxists]] and [[heterodox economics|heterodox economists]] is a way to describe a society wherein the [[productive forces]] are owned and run by the state in a capitalist way, even if such a state calls itself [[socialist]].<ref>{{cite web

By that definition,  a state capitalist country is one where the government controls the economy and essentially acts like a single giant [[corporation]].
There are various theories and critiques of state capitalism, some of which have been around since the [[October Revolution]] or even before. The common themes among them are to identify that the workers do not meaningfully control the [[means of production]] and that commodity relations and production for profit still occur within state capitalism. 

This term is also used by some advocates of [[laissez-faire]] capitalism to mean a private [[capitalism|capitalist]] economy under [[Sovereign state|state]] control, often meaning a privately-owned economy that is under economic planning. In the 1930s, [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]] claimed that Italian Fascism's economic system of [[corporatism]] could be seen either as a form of state capitalism or as [[state socialism]], as he claimed that both were essentially the same.<ref>Mussolini, Benito; Schnapp, Jeffery Thompson (ed.); Sears, Olivia E.

''A Primer of Italian Fascism''. University of Nebraska Press, 2000. Pp. 158-159. "Our path would lead inexorably into state capitalism, which is nothing more nor less than [[state socialism]] turned on its head. In either event, [whether the outcome be state capitalism or state socialism] the result is the bureaucratization of the economic activities of the nation." - Benito Mussolini on Italian Fascism's economic goals."</ref>   This term was often used to describe the controlled economies of the great powers in the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

==Origins and early uses of the term==
[[Image:Wilhelm Liebknecht.jpg|right|thumb|Liebknecht - "combatted [...] state capitalism"]]
The term itself was in use within the [[socialist]] movement from the late nineteenth century onwards. [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] in 1896 said: "Nobody has combatted State Socialism more than we German Socialists; nobody has shown more distinctively than I, that State Socialism is really State capitalism!" <ref>{{cite web

It has been suggested that the concept of state capitalism can be traced back to [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s critique within the [[First International]] of the potential for state exploitation under Marxism, or to [[Jan Waclav Machajski]]'s argument in ''The Intellectual Worker'' (1905) that socialism was a movement of the [[intelligentsia]] as a class, leading to a new type of society he called state capitalism.<ref>Michael S Fox [http://www.geocities.com/cordobakaf/ciliga_trotsky.pdf "Ante Ciliga, Trotskii and State Capitalism: Theory, Tactics and Reevaluation during the Purge Era, 1935-1939"], ''Slavic Review'', 50, no. 1 (Spring 1991): 127-143. Published in Croatian translation in ?asopis za suvremenu povijest [Journal of Contemporary History], Zagreb, no. 3, 1994, 427-450.</ref><ref>For Bakunin: Gouldner, A.W. 1982. 'Marx's last battle: Bakunin and the First International', ''Theory and Society'' 11(6), November, pp. 853-84. Gouldner argues that Bakunin formulated an original critique of Marxism as 'the ideology, not of the working class, but of a new class of scientific intelligentsia--who would corrupt socialism, make themselves a new elite, and impose their rule on the majority' (pp. 860-1)</ref><ref>For Machajski: [[Marshall S. Shatz]] ''[http://www.geocities.com/cordobakaf/cont.html Jan Waclaw Machajski: A Radical Critic Of The Russian Intelligensia And Socialism]''; TB Bottomore ''Elites and Society'' p.54</ref>

During [[World War I]], taking as his cue [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s idea that Tsarism was taking a "Prussian path" to capitalism, the Bolshevik [[Nikolai Bukharin]] identified a new stage in the development of capitalism, in which all sectors of national production and all important social institutions had come under state management; he termed this new stage 'state capitalism.' <ref>Bukharin, N. 1915 [1972]. ''Imperialism and World Economy''. London: Merlin. p. 158)</ref>

After the October Revolution, Lenin used the term in a positive way. In spring 1918, during a short period of economic liberalism prior to the introduction of [[war communism]], and again during the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) of 1921, Lenin justified the introduction of state capitalism under the political control of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] to further central control and develop the productive forces:<blockquote>Reality tells us that state capitalism would be a step forward. If in a small space of time we could achieve state capitalism, that would be a victory. (Lenin 1918)<ref>Lenin's [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/cw/volume27.htm Collected Works Vol. 27], p. 293, quoted by [http://www.geocities.com/aufheben2/auf_6_ussr1.html Aufheben]</ref></blockquote>

==Use by Marxists==
===Use by the Russian Communist Left===
The earliest critique of the USSR as state-capitalist was formulated by various groups adhering to [[left communism]]. One major tendency of the [[Left_communism#Russian_Left_Communism|1918 Russian communist left]] criticised the re-employment of [[authoritarian]] capitalist relations and methods within production. As [[Ossinsky]] in particular argued, [[one-man management]] and the other impositions of capitalist discipline would stifle the active participation of workers in the organisation of production; [[Taylorism]] turned workers into the appendages of machines, and piece-wages imposed individualist rather than collective rewards in production so instilling [[petty bourgeois]] values into workers. In sum these measures were seen as the re-transformation of proletarians within production from collective subject back into the atomised objects of capital. The working class, it was argued, had to consciously participate in economic as well as political administration. This tendency within the 1918 left communists emphasized that the problem with capitalist production was that it turned workers into objects.  Its [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] lay in the workers' conscious creativity and participation, which is reminiscent of [[Marx's critique of alienation]].<ref>Jerome, W. and Buick, A. 1967. 'Soviet state capitalism? The history of an idea', ''Survey'' 62, January, pp. 58-71.</ref> 

These criticisms were revived on the left of the [[Russian Communist Party]] after the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (b)|10th Congress]] in 1921, which introduced the [[New Economic Policy]]. Many members of the [[Workers' Opposition]] and the [[Decists]] (both later banned) and two new underground Left Communist groups, [[Gavril Myasnikov]]'s [[Workers' Group]] and the [[Workers' Truth]] group, developed the idea that Russia was becoming a state capitalist society ruled by a new bureaucratic class.<ref>Fox "Ante Ciliga"</ref><ref>EH Carr, ''The Interregnum 1923-1924'', London, 1954, p80</ref> The most developed version of this idea was in a 1931 booklet by Myasnikov.<ref>Marshall Shatz "[http://www.geocities.com/cordobakaf/machg.html Makhaevism After Machajski]"</ref>

===Use by Mensheviks===
After 1929, exiled [[Mensheviks]] such as [[Theodore Dan]] began to argue that Stalin's Russia constituted a state capitalist society.<ref>Liebich, A. 1987. 'Marxism and totalitarianism: Rudolf Hilferding and the Mensheviks', ''Dissent'' 34, Spring, pp. 223-40</ref>

===Use by Trotskyists===
[[Image:Tony-Cliff.jpg|thumb|right|Tony Cliff: propounded a theory of state capitalism in the Soviet Union]]
[[Leon Trotsky]] said the term state capitalism "originally arose to designate the phenomena which arise when a bourgeois state takes direct charge of the means of transport or of industrial enterprises" and is therefore a "partial negation" of capitalism <ref>{{cite book

|fomat = HTML
|accessdate = 2007-05-31}}</ref>. However, Trotsky rejected that description of the [[USSR]] claiming instead that it was a [[degenerated workers' state]]. After [[World War II]], [[orthodox Trotskyism|most in the Trotskyist movement]] accepted an analysis of the Soviet block countries as being [[deformed workers' states]]. However, alternative currents within the Trotskyist tradition have developed the theory of state capitalism as a [[New Class]] theory to explain of what they regard as the essentially non-socialist nature of the [[USSR]], [[Cuba]], [[China]], and other self-proclaimed [[socialist states]].

The discussion goes back to internal debates in the [[Left Opposition]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s. [[Ante Ciliga]], a member of the Left Opposition imprisoned in the 1930s at [[Verkhen-Uralske]], described the evolution of many Left Opposition members to a theory of state capitalism under the influence of members of [[Gavril Myasnikov]]'s Workers Group and other Left Communist factions.<ref>''Au pays du grand mensonge'', see Michael Fox "[http://www.geocities.com/cordobakaf/ciliga_trotsky.pdf Ante Ciliga]" and [[Philippe Bourrinet]] "[http://www.left-dis.nl/uk/ciliga.htm An Ambiguous Journey]"</ref> On release, and returning to activity in the [[International Left Opposition]], Ciliga "was one of the first, after 1936,to raise the theory [of state capitalism] in Trotskyist circles".<ref>Fox</ref> [[George Orwell]], who moved in similar [[anti-Stalinist left]] circles to Ciliga, used the term in his ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938).

After 1940, dissident Trotskyist currents developed more theoretically sophisticated accounts of state capitalism. One influential formulation has been that of the [[Johnson-Forest Tendency]] of [[CLR James]] and [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] who formulated her theory in the early 1940s on the basis of a study of the first three [[Five Year Plan]]s alongside readings of Marx's [[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|early humanist writings]]. Their political evolution would lead them away from Trotskyism. Another is that of [[Tony Cliff]], associated with the [[International Socialist Tendency]] and the British [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP), dating back to the late 1940s. Unlike Johnson-Forest, Cliff formulated a theory of state capitalism that would enable his group to remain within the Trotskyist fold, albeit in a heterodox way.<ref>Aufheben [http://www.geocities.com/aufheben2/auf_6_ussr1.html#[35&#93; Cliff and the neo-Trotskyist theory of the USSR as state capitalist] in What Was The USSR?</ref> A relatively recent text by [[Stephen Resnick]] and [[Richard D. Wolff]], ''Class Theory and History'', explores what they call state capitalism in the former [[Soviet Union]], continuing a theme that has been debated within Trotskyist theory for most of the past century.

Compare with other left-wing theories regarding Soviet-style societies: [[deformed workers' state]]s, [[degenerated workers' state]]s, [[new class]], [[state socialism]], [[bureaucratic collectivism]] and [[coordinatorism]].

===Use by later left communists and council communists===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[image:AntonPannekoek.jpg|thumb|right|Anton Pannekoek, Council Communist]] -->
The [[left communist]] [[council communist]] traditions outside Russia see the Soviet system as state capitalist. [[Otto R<U+00FC>hle]], a key figure in German left communism, developed this view from the 1920s, and it was later articulated by Dutch council communist [[Anton Pannekoek]], for instance in "[http://www.marxists.org/archive/pannekoe/1936/dictatorship.htm State Capitalism and Dictatorship]" (1936).

===Use by Maoists and <U+2018>Anti-Revisionists<U+2019>===
From 1956 to the early 1980s, the [[Communist Party of China]] and their [[Maoist]] or <U+2018>[[anti-revisionist]]<U+2019> adherents around the world often described the [[Soviet Union]] as state-capitalist, essentially using the accepted Marxist definition, albeit on a different basis and in reference to a different span of time from either the Trotskyists or the left-communists. Specifically, the Maoists and their descendants use the term state capitalism as part of their description of the style and politics of [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] and his successors, as well as to similar leaders and policies in other self-styled <U+2018>socialist<U+2019> states.<ref>[http://www.mltranslations.org/Ireland/ico.htm ''The Economics of Revisionism''] by the Irish Communist Organisation, 1967.</ref> This was involved in the ideological break of the [[Sino-Soviet Split]].

After Mao's death, amidst the supporters of the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the exploits of the '[[Gang of Four (China)|Gang of Four]]', most extended the state capitalist formulation to China itself, and ceased to support the [[Communist Party of China]], which likewise distanced itself from these former [[fraternal party|fraternal]] groups. [[Hoxhaism|Another group]] appeared out of this movement in 1978, aligned with [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] and its leader [[Enver Hoxha]], who insisted that Mao himself had pursued state capitalist and [[Marxist|revisionist]] economic policies.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/toc.htm ''Imperialism and the Revolution''] by Enver Hoxha, 1978.</ref>

Most current [[Communist]] groups descended from the Maoist ideological tradition still hold to the description of both China and the Soviet Union as being <U+2018>state-capitalist<U+2019> from a certain point in their history onwards <U+2014> most commonly, the Soviet Union from 1956 to its collapse in 1991, and China from 1976 to the present day. Maoists and <U+2018>anti-revisionists<U+2019> also sometimes employ the term <U+2018>[[Social-imperialism]]<U+2019> to describe socialist states that they consider to actually be capitalist in essence <U+2014> their phrase, ''"socialist in words, imperialist in deeds"'' denotes this.

==Use by Classical Liberals and laissez-faire capitalists==
[[Image:Murray Rothbard.jpg|thumb|left|Murray Rothbard.jpg|Murray Rothbard put forward a libertarian analysis of state capitalism]]

The term is not used by the classical liberals to describe the public ownership of the means of production. The economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] explains the reason: "''The socialist movement takes great pains to circulate frequently new labels for its ideally constructed state. Each worn-out label is replaced by another which raises hopes of an ultimate solution of the insoluble basic problem of Socialism<U+2014>until it becomes obvious that nothing has been changed but the name. The most recent slogan is "State Capitalism." It is not commonly realized that this covers nothing more than what used to be called Planned Economy and State Socialism, and that State Capitalism, Planned Economy, and State Socialism diverge only in non-essentials from the "classic" ideal of egalitarian Socialism.''"<ref>{{cite book

==State capitalism in Western countries==
An alternate definition is that state capitalism is a close relationship between the government and private capitalism, such as one in which the private capitalists produce for a guaranteed market. An example of this would be the [[military-industrial complex]] where autonomous [[entrepreneurial]] firms produce for lucrative government contracts and are not subject to the discipline of competitive markets. Many see this as part of a continuum characterizing the modern world economy with "normal" capitalism at one extreme and complete state capitalism like that of the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]] at the other. This continuum has narrowed somewhat since the 1980s with the collapse of the USSR and its satellites and with large-scale [[privatization]] in [[Eastern Europe]] and most of the [[third world]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Both the Trotskyist definition and this one flow from discussion among Marxists at the beginning of the twentieth century, most notably [[Nikolai Bukharin]] who, in his book ''Imperialism and the world economy'' thought that advanced, '[[imperialist]]' countries exhibited the latter definition and considered (and rejected) the possibility that they could arrive at the former.

State capitalism is practised by a variety of Western countries with respect to certain strategic resources important for [[national security]]. These may involve private investment as well. For example, a government may own or even monopolize oil production or transport infrastructure to ensure availability in the case of war. Examples include [[Neste]], [[Statoil]] and [[OMV]].

==State capitalism in European Studies==
Several European scholars and political economists have been increasingly using the term to describe one of the three major varieties of capitalism that prevail in the modern context of the European Union. This approach is mainly influenced by Schmidt's (2002) article on ''The Futures of European Capitalism'', in which he divides modern European capitalism in three groups: Market, Managed and State. Here, state capitalism refers to a system where high coordination between the state, large firms and labour unions ensures economic growth and development in a quasi-[[corporatist]] model. The author cites France and, to a lesser extent, Italy as the prime examples of modern European State capitalism.<ref>{{cite book
