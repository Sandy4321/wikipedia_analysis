The {{nihongo|'''''Satsuma'' class'''|<U+85A9><U+6469><U+578B><U+6226><U+8266>|Satsuma-gata senkan}} was a pair of [[semi-dreadnought]] [[battleship]]s built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) in the first decade of the 20th century. They were the first battleships to be built in Japan and marked a transitional stage between the [[pre-dreadnought]] and true [[dreadnought]] designs. They saw no combat during [[World War I]], although {{ship|Japanese battleship|Satsuma||2}} led a [[squadron (naval)|squadron]] that occupied several German colonies in the [[Pacific Ocean]] in 1914. Both ships were disarmed and expended as targets in 1922<U+2013>24 in accordance with the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922.

==Background==
[[File:SatsumaDrawing.jpg|thumb|left|Line drawing of the battleship ''Satsuma'' from Brassey's Naval Annual 1912. ''Aki'' similar, but three funnels.]]
The ''Satsuma'' class was ordered in late 1904 under the 1904 War Naval Supplementary Program during the [[Russo-Japanese War]].<ref>Itani, Lengerer & Rehm-Takahara, p. 53</ref> Unlike the previous {{sclass-|Katori|battleship|0}} [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s, they were the first battleships ordered from Japanese shipyards, although the first ship in the class, ''Satsuma'', used a lot of imported components.<ref name=e9>Evans & Peattie, p. 159</ref>

They were originally intended to mount a dozen {{convert|12|in|adj=on|0}} gun in four twin and four single-[[gun turret]]s, but the combination of a shortage of Japanese-built 12-inch guns<ref name=g8/> and their additional expense<ref name=e9/> caused the ships to be redesigned to carry four 12-inch and twelve {{convert|10|in|adj=on|0}} guns, all in twin-gun turrets.<ref name=g8>Gardiner & Gray, p. 238</ref> The intended armament of these ships, laid down before {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, would have made them the first "all big-gun" battleships in the world had they been completed to their original design.<ref name=p5/>

Probably reflecting extensive British technical assistance, the ''Satsuma''-class ships greatly resembled an enlarged version of the British {{sclass-|Lord Nelson|battleship|4}} with the single-gun [[amidships]] [[Battleship secondary armament|intermediate]] turrets replaced by twin-gun turrets.<ref name=p5>Preston, p. 195</ref> With their heavy intermediate armament, the ships were considered to be semi-dreadnoughts, a transitional stage between [[pre-dreadnought]]s with their light intermediate armament and dreadnoughts solely equipped with large guns.<ref name=j7>Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 23</ref>

==Description==
The construction of {{ship|Japanese battleship|Aki||2}} was delayed since she could not be [[Keel|laid down]] until the [[slipway]] occupied by the [[armored cruiser]] {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Tsukuba||2}} was freed by that ship's [[Ship naming and launching|launching]]. The IJN took the opportunity provided by the delay to modify the ship to accommodate [[steam turbine]]s and various other changes that generally increased her size. The changes were great enough that ''Aki'' is generally considered a [[sister ship|half sister]] to ''Satsuma''.<ref name=g8/> The crew ranged from 800 to 940 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=j7/>

''Satsuma'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|482|ft|m|1}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|83.5|ft|m|1}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|27.5|ft|m|1}}. She [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|19372|LT|t}} at normal load.<ref name=j7/>

''Aki'' was {{convert|492|ft|m|1}} long overall, had a beam of {{convert|83.6|ft|m|1}}, and the same draft as her half-sister. She displaced {{convert|20100|LT|t}} at normal load.<ref name=j7/>

===Propulsion===
''Satsuma'' was powered by a pair of [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]], each driving one propeller shaft, using steam generated by 20 Miyabara [[water-tube boiler]]s using a mixture of coal and [[fuel oil]]. The engines were rated at a total of {{convert|17300|ihp|lk=in}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|18.25|kn|lk=in}}. During the ship's [[sea trial]]s she reached {{convert|18.95|kn}} from {{convert|18507|ihp|abbr=on}}. ''Satsuma'' carried a maximum of {{convert|2860|LT|t}} of coal and {{convert|377|LT|t}} of oil<ref name=j7/> which allowed her to steam for {{convert|9100|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. Unlike her half-sister, she only had two [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s.<ref name=p5/>

''Aki'' was intended use the same type of engines as her sister, but the IJN decided fit her with a pair of Curtiss steam turbine sets after she was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] in 1907.<ref>Itani, Lengerer & Rehm-Takahara, p. 60</ref> The turbines each powered one propeller shaft using steam from 15 Miyabara boilers. The turbines were rated at a total of {{convert|24000|shp|lk=in}} for a design speed of {{convert|20|kn}}. The ship reached a top speed of {{convert|20.25|kn}} during her sea trials from {{convert|27740|shp|abbr=on}}.<ref name=j4>Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, pp. 23<U+2013>24</ref> She carried a maximum of {{convert|3000|LT|t}} of coal and {{convert|172|LT|t}} of oil gave her the same range as her half sister.<ref name=p5/>

===Armament===
The ships were completed with four 45-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[EOC 12 inch/45 naval gun|12-inch 41st Year Type guns]] in two gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the [[superstructure]].<ref name=j7/> They fired {{convert|850|lb|kg|adj=on|0}} [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] (AP) shells at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2800|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}};<ref>Friedman, pp. 272</ref> this gave a maximum range of {{convert|22000|m|yd|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.<ref>Itani, Lengerer & Rehm-Takahara, p. 67</ref> The intermediate armament was much more numerous than in the preceding ''Katori'' class, with six twin-gun turrets equipped with 45-caliber [[Vickers 10 inch /45 naval gun|Type 41 10-inch guns]], three turrets on each side of the superstructure.<ref name=p5/> The guns had a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2707|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} when firing {{convert|500|lb|kg|adj=on|0}} shells.<ref>Friedman, p. 274</ref>

The other major difference between the two ships was that ''Aki''{{'}}s secondary armament consisted of eight 45-caliber [[6-inch/45 41st Year Type naval gun|6-inch 41st Year Type guns]], mounted in [[casemate]]s in the sides of the hull.<ref name=g8/> The gun fired a {{convert|100|lb|adj=on}} AP shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2706|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.<ref>Friedman, p. 276</ref> ''Satsuma'', in contrast, was equipped with a dozen 40-caliber [[QF 4.7 inch Gun Mk I<U+2013>IV|4.7-inch 41st Year Type]] [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF) guns]], mounted in casemates in the sides of the hull.<ref name=p5/> The gun fired a {{convert|45|lb|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2150|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.<ref>Friedman, p. 278</ref> 

The ships were also equipped with four (''Satsuma'') or eight (''Aki'') 40-caliber [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder 12-cwt QF guns]]<ref group=Note>"Cwt" is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.</ref> and four 28-caliber [[8-centimeter/40 41st Year Type naval gun|12-pounder QF guns]].<ref name=j7/> Both of these guns fired {{convert|5.67|kg|lb|adj=on|disp=flip}} shells with muzzle velocities of {{convert|2300|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and {{convert|450|m/s|ft/s|disp=flip}} respectively.<ref>Friedman, p. 279</ref> In addition, the battleships were fitted with five submerged {{convert|18|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s, two on each [[broadside]] and one in the stern.<ref name=p5/>

===Armor===
The [[waterline]] [[armor belt|main belt]] of the ''Satsuma''-class vessels consisted of [[Krupp cemented armor]] that had a maximum thickness of {{convert|9|in|mm|0}} [[amidships]] and tapered to a thickness of {{convert|4|in|mm|0}} inches at the ends of the ship.<ref name=g8/> A {{convert|6|in|0|adj=on}} [[strake]] of armor protected the casemates.<ref name=j7/> The barbettes for the main guns were {{convert|7|-|9.5|in}} thick. The armor of ''Satsuma''{{'}}s main gun turrets had a maximum thickness of {{convert|8|in|0}} inches and those of ''Aki'' were an inch thicker. The [[Deck (ship)|deck]] armor was {{convert|2|-|3|in|mm|0}} thick and the [[conning tower]] was protected by six inches of armor.<ref name=g8/>

==Service==
The completion of the British battleship ''Dreadnought'' with her all big-gun-armament and steam turbines in 1906 meant that these ships were obsolete even before they were completed. The IJN recognized that fact when it drew up the first iteration of its [[Eight-eight fleet|Eight-Eight Fleet]] building plan for eight first-class battleships and eight [[battlecruiser]]s in 1910 and did not include them.<ref>Evans & Peattie, pp. 159<U+2013>60</ref>

''Aki'' was refitting at [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] and ''Satsuma'' was assigned to the 1st Battleship Squadron when World War I began in August 1914.<ref name=p5/> The latter served as [[Rear Admiral]] [[Tatsuo Matsumura]]'s flagship in the [[Second South Seas Squadron]] as it seized the German possessions of the [[Caroline Islands|Caroline]] and the [[Palau Islands]] in October 1914.<ref>Peattie, pp. 42<U+2013>43</ref> ''Satsuma'' rejoined the 1st Battleship Squadron in 1915, was refitted at [[Sasebo Naval Arsenal]] in 1916 and served with the 1st Squadron for the rest of the war. ''Aki'' was also assigned to the 1st Squadron upon the completion of her refit and remained with it until she was transferred to the 2nd Battleship Squadron in 1918.<ref name=p5/> 

In the years immediately following the end of the war, the United States, Britain, and Japan all launched huge naval construction programs. All three countries decided that a new naval arms race would be ill-advised, and so convened the [[Washington Naval Conference]] to discuss arms limitations, which produced the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], signed in February 1922.<ref>Evans & Peattie, pp. 191<U+2013>94</ref> Japan was well over the tonnage limits and all of her obsolete predreadnought and semi-dreadnought battleships had to be disposed of by the end of 1924.<ref>[[s:Washington Naval Treaty, 1922|Washington Naval Treaty]], Chapter I: Article II.</ref> Both ships were disarmed at Yokosuka in 1922, stricken from the [[Navy List]] during 1923 and converted into target ships. ''Aki'' was sunk by the battlecruiser {{ship|Japanese battleship|Kong<U+014D>||2}} and the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hy<U+016B>ga||2}} in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1924; ''Satsuma'' was sunk by the battleships {{ship|Japanese battleship|Nagato||2}} and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Mutsu||2}} five days later in the same area.<ref name=j4/>
