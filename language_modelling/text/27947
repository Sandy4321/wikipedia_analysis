The Eisenbahn Trail was a [[Rails to Trails]] project, built on the abandoned Fox Valley Railroad right of way.<ref name=FDL /> The name "Eisenbahn" is a reference to the trails origins, meaning "iron road."<ref name=TrailLink>{{cite web|title=Eisenbahn State Trail|url=https://www.traillink.com/trail/eisenbahn-state-trail.aspx|website=TrailLink|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref> The railroad was originally contructed in 1864 by [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company]]. It was purchased by [[Fox River Valley Railroad]] in 1988 before being abandoned in 1999.<ref name="Washington County">{{cite web|title=Eisenbahn State Trail|url=http://www.co.washington.wi.us/departments.iml?Detail=150|website=Washington County|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref> The official opening of the segment located in Washington County was on April 28, 2006.
