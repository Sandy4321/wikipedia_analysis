Over her competitive career, she became the record-holder for those distances in Liberia.

Dinkins competed at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] for Liberia in the 100 m race, but did not advance to the finals.  She returned to compete in the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] also competing for Liberia in the 100 m race, but once more failed to advance to the finals.

A 1987 graduate of [[California State University, Dominguez Hills]], Dinkins more-or-less retired from track and field competition in 2003 but still works closely with the Liberian track and field teams.{{ref|TheAnalyst}}
