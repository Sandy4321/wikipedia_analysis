{{FixBunching|end}}

The '''Syria-Lebanon campaign''', also known as '''Operation Exporter''',<ref>Playfair, p. 203</ref> was the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invasion of [[Vichy France|Vichy French]]-controlled [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], in June-July 1941, during [[World War II]].

''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' referred to the fighting as a "mixed show",<ref>Time Magazine, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,851152,00.html Mixed Show]</ref> while it was taking place, and the campaign remains little known, even in the countries that took part. There is evidence that Allied [[censor]]s acted to suppress or reduce reportage of the fierce fighting.<ref>Brune, p.48</ref>  Senior Allied commanders and/or politicians believed that knowledge of fighting against French forces could have a negative effect on public opinion in Allied countries.

== Causes ==

The Allied offensive was aimed at preventing [[Nazi Germany]] from using the [[Vichy French]]-controlled [[French Mandate of Syria|Mandate of Syria]] and [[French Mandate of Lebanon|Mandate of Lebanon]] as springboards for attacks on the Allied stronghold of [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], as the Allies fought a major campaign against [[Axis Powers|Axis]] forces further west, in [[North Africa]].  Although the French had ceded autonomy to Syria in September 1936, they had retained treaty rights to maintain armed forces and to maintain two airfields in the territory.

Fom 1 April, after a [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]], Iraq was controlled by pro-German [[1941 Iraqi coup d'<U+00E9>tat|rebel forces under Rashid Ali]].

In May 1941, Admiral [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Darlan]] signed an agreement with the Germans known as the "[[Paris Protocols]]."  Darlan signed on behalf of [[Vichy France]] and the agreement granted the Germans access to military facilities in Syria.<ref> Keegan p. 676</ref> Though the protocols were never ratified, [[Charles Huntziger]], the [[Minister of Defence (France)|Vichy Minister of War]], sent orders to [[Henri Dentz]], the [[High Commissioners of French-mandated Syria and Lebanon|High Commissioner for the Levant]].  In accordance with these orders, aircraft of the German Air Force (''[[Luftwaffe]]'') and the Italian Royal Air Force (''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'') were allowed to refuel in Syria.  Disguised as Iraqi aircraft and painted as such, the [[Fliegerf<U+00FC>hrer Irak|German and Italian aircraft]] landed in Syria ''en route'' to the [[Kingdom of Iraq]] during the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]].  The Germans also requested Vichy authorities to use the Syrian railways to send armaments to Iraqi rebels in [[Mosul]]. There was a threat of [[Anglo-Iraqi War#Causes|Axis support for anti-British parties in Iraq]], thus endangering strategic oil supplies and communications. British [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], [[Commander in Chief]] of the [[Middle East Command]], had to respond to the threat posed by Vichy collaboration with Germany and Italy.

== The balance of forces ==
{{See|Syria-Lebanon Campaign order of battle}}

The Vichy French and Allied forces confronting each other in Syria and Lebanon were evenly matched in general.

=== Vichy French forces ===

The High Commissioner of the Levant was General [[Henri Dentz]].  Dentz was also [[Commander in Chief]] of the [[Army of the Levant]] (''Arm<U+00E9>e du Levant'').  This formation was divided into the regular metropolitan colonial troops and the "special troops" (''troupes speciales'', which were indigenous Syrian and Lebanese soldiers). <ref name="Mollo, p.144">Mollo, p.144</ref>

Dentz had seven infantry battalions of regular French troops at his disposal.  These battalions included the [[1st Foreign Engineer Regiment|6th Infantry Regiment of the French Foreign Legion]] and the 24th Colonial Infantry Regiment. <ref name="Mollo, p.144"/>

Dentz had eleven infantry battalions of "special troops."  In addition, Dentz had two artillery groups and supporting units. The "special troops" included at least 5,000 cavalry -- horse and motorized. <ref name="Mollo, p.144"/>

The [[Vichy French Air Force]] (''Arm<U+00E9>e de l'Air de Vichy'') in the Levant was relatively strong at the outbreak of hostilities. Starting with over 90 aircraft, three additional groups were flown in from France and from North Africa.  This brought the strength of the air force in Lebanon and Syria up to 289 aircraft.

Two destroyers and three submarines of the [[French Navy]] (''Marine Nationale'') were available to support the Vichy forces in the Levant.

While German interest in the French mandates of Syria and Lebanon turned out to be limited, German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] permitted reinforcement of the French troops by allowing French aircraft ''en route'' from Algeria to Syria to safely fly over Axis-controlled territory and refuel in German-controlled [[Eleusina]] air base in Greece<ref>Shores & Ehrengardt p. 30</ref>. Activity of German aircraft based in [[Greece]] and the [[Dodecanese Islands]] was interpreted by the Allies as being in support of Vichy troops. In reality, though Dentz briefly considered accepting German support, he turned down the offer on 13 June <ref> de Wailly, Henri, ''Syrie 1941, la guerre occult<U+00E9>e'', p. 246</ref>.

=== Allied forces ===

Initially Allied forces to the south of Syria in the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] used in the campaign consisted of two main formations:
[[Image:SyriaWWII en.svg|300px|thumb|Map of Syria and Lebanon during World War II.]] The Allied forces involved in the campaign were under the command of British General [[Henry Maitland Wilson]].
* [[Australian 7th Division]] (minus the 18th Brigade, which was in North Africa at the [[Siege of Tobruk]])
* ''Gentforce'': two [[Free French]] brigades of the [[1st Free French Division]] (including two battalions of the [[13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade]] attached to the 1st Free French Brigade) and the Indian 5th Brigade (of the [[Indian 4th Infantry Division]]) with artillery, engineers, and other support services attached to form the "5th Indian Brigade Group".

''[[Iraqforce]]'', Allied forces in [[Iraq]] that were commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir [[Edward Quinan]], was used in this campaign to attack northern and central Syria from the east.  The Iraqforce formations used in Syria consisted of the following units:

* The [[Indian 10th Infantry Division]] and elements of the Indian 17th Infantry Brigade (from the [[Indian 8th Infantry Division]])
* ''[[Habforce]]'': the British [[4th Cavalry Brigade]] and the [[Arab Legion]], under [[John Glubb]] ("Glubb Pasha")

[[Commando]] and raiding operations were undertaken by the British Army's [[British Commandos#Middle East|No. 11 Commando]], and ''[[Palmach]]'', a unit recruited from [[Jew]]s in the [[British Mandate of Palestine]]. ''Palmach'' also provided interpreters and guides to other Allied units.

[[Close air support]] was provided by squadrons from the British [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Royal Australian Air Force]] and the ground forces on the coast were supported by [[artillery|shelling]] from British [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Australian Navy]] units.  Concerning fighters, [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Wavell]] provided [[Henry Maitland Wilson|Wilson]] with 70 aircraft.  By comparison, the Vichy French had at least 100 fighters.  The forces were more evenly matched than numbers alone would indicate, with British [[Hawker Hurricane]]s and brand-new, US-built [[Curtiss P-40|Curtiss Tomahawk]]s, matching up well against French [[Dewoitine D.520|Dewoitine 520]]s and [[Potez 63]]s.

The [[Mediterranean Sea]] was a traditional focus of British maritime power.  The [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]] was Britain's instrument of this maritime power.

Allied forces in reserve included the [[6th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 6th Infantry Division]] (including the [[Czechoslovak 11th Infantry Battalion|Czechoslovak 11th Infantry Battalion &mdash; East]] attached to the [[23rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|23rd Brigade]]) and the [[Australian 6th Division|Australian 17th Brigade]]. In mid June British 6th Infantry Division with two infantry brigades under command came into the line as reinforcements, mainly on the Damascus front, and the whole southern force was placed under the command of [[Australian I Corps]] HQ on 18 June.

== The plan of attack ==

The [[Allied]] plan of attack was devised by [[General]] [[Henry Maitland Wilson|Wilson]].  The plan called for four lines of attack: on Damascus from Palestine; on Beirut from Palestine; on northern Syria from Iraq and; on Palmyra (in central Syria) and Tripoli from Iraq.

=== Damascus ===

[[Image:AWM 009747 .jpg|200px|thumb|right|The fall of [[Damascus]] to the Allies, late June 1941. A car carrying the Free French commanders, [[General]] [[Georges Catroux]] and [[Major-General]] [[Paul Legentilhomme|Paul Louis Le Gentilhomme]], enters the city. They are escorted by Vichy French [[Circassian]] cavalry (''Gardes Tcherkess'').]]

The 5th Indian Brigade Group, commanded by [[Brigadier]] [[Wilfrid Lewis Lloyd]], were ordered to cross the Syrian border from the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] and take [[Quneitra]] and [[Deraa]]. It was anticipated that this would open the way for the [[1st Free French Division]] forces to advance to [[Damascus]].  Four days after the commencement of the operation, this force was bought under unified command and was named ''Gentforce'' after its French commander, [[Major-General]] [[Paul Legentilhomme|Paul Louis Le Gentilhomme]].

=== Beirut ===

The [[Australian 7th Division]], commanded by [[Major-General]] [[John Lavarack]]<ref>Long (1953), p. 338</ref> (succeeded by Major-General [[Arthur Samuel Allen|Arthur "Tubby" Allen]] on 18 June when Lavarack took over [[I Corps (Australia)|Australian I Corps]]),<ref>Long (1953), p. 413</ref> had the responsibility of advancing from [[Palestine]] along the coastal road from [[Haifa]] towards [[Beirut]].  The Australian 21st Brigade was tasked with taking Beirut.  The Australian 25th Brigade was tasked with attacking the major Vichy French airbase at [[Rayak (Riyaq)|Rayak]].  The operation was also to include a supporting [[commando]] landing from [[Cyprus]] at the south of the [[Litani River]].

=== Northern Syria ===

Once the two southern prongs were well engaged, it was planned that a third force, comprising formations drawn from ''[[Iraqforce]]'', would attack Syria from Iraq. The bulk of [[10th Indian Infantry Division]], commanded by [[Major-General]] [[William Slim|William "Bill" Slim]], was to advance northwest up the [[Euphrates River]] from [[Haditha]] in [[Iraq]] (upstream from Baghdad) towards [[Deir ez Zor]] and thence to [[Raqqa]] and [[Aleppo]] to threaten the communication and supply lines of the Vichy forces defending Beirut against the Australians advancing from the south, in particular the railway line running northwards through Aleppo to [[Turkey]] (at the time, Turkey was thought by some to be sympathetic to the Vichy government and to Germany).

Meanwhile, a group comprising two infantry battalions from the 10th Indian Division's 20th Brigade and two from [[8th Infantry Division (India)|8th Indian Division's]] 17th Brigade, would operate independently to capture all the territory in north-east Syria. 20th Brigade were to make a feint from [[Mosul]] and the 17th Brigade would advance into the ''Bec du Canard'' (or Duck's Bill) region through which a railway from Aleppo ran eastward to [[Mosul]] and then to [[Baghdad]].<ref>Playfair, p. 217</ref><ref>Mackenzie, p. 121</ref>

=== Central Syria ===

Finally Wilson's plan called for ''[[Habforce]]'',  consisting of the [[4th Cavalry Brigade]], the 1st Battalion of the [[The Essex Regiment|Essex Regiment]], the [[Arab Legion|Arab Legion Mechanized Regiment]], and a battery each of field, anti-tank, and anti-aircraft artillery to gather in western [[Iraq]] between Rutba and the [[Transjordan]] border. At the same time as the thrust up the Euphrates, this force would advance in a northwesterly direction to take [[Palmyra]] in Syria.  ''Habforce'' was to secure the oil pipeline from [[Haditha]] to [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]].  ''Habforce'' was in Iraq, attached to ''Iraqforce'', because it had previously struck across the desert from the [[Transjordan]] border as part of the relief of [[RAF Habbaniya]] during the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]].

== The campaign ==

Hostilities commenced on [[8 June]] [[1941]]. The major battles of the campaign were:

* [[Battle of the Litani River]] ([[9 June]] [[1941]]): part of the advance on Beirut from Palestine
* [[Battle of Jezzine (1941)|Battle of Jezzine]] ([[13 June]] [[1941]]): part of the advance on Beirut from Palestine
* [[Battle of Kissou<U+00E9>]] ([[15 June]] [[1941]] to [[17 June]] [[1941]]): part of the advance on Damascus from Palestine
* [[Battle of Damascus]] ([[18 June]] [[1941]] to [[21 June]] [[1941]]): part of the advance on Damascus from Palestine
* [[Battle of Merdjayoun]] ([[19 June]] [[1941]] to [[24 June]] [[1941]]): part of the advance on Beirut and Damascus from Palestine
* [[Battle of Palmyra]] ([[1 July]] [[1941]]): part of the advance on Palmyra and Tripoli from Iraq
* [[Battle of Deir ez Zor]] ([[3 July]] [[1941]]): part of the advance on central and northern Syria from Iraq
* [[Battle of Damour]] ([[5 July]] [[1941]] to [[9 July]] [[1941]]): part of the advance on Beirut from Palestine
* [[Battle of Beirut]] ([[12 July]]): part of the advance on Beirut from Palestine

=== War in the air ===

The initial advantage that the [[Vichy French Air Force]] (''Arm<U+00E9>e de l'Air de Vichy'') enjoyed did not last long. The Vichy French lost most of their aircraft during the campaign. The majority of the lost aircraft were destroyed on the ground<ref name="Mollo, p. 146">Mollo, p.146</ref> where the flat terrain, absence of infrastructure and absence of modern [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft artillery]] (AAA) made them vulnerable to air attacks. On June 26, a [[strafing]] run by [[Curtiss P-40|Tomahawks]] of [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF]] on [[Homs]] airfield destroyed five and damaged six [[Dewoitine D.520]]s of Fighter Squadron II/3 (''Groupe de Chasse II/3'') in a matter of seconds.<ref>Shores & Ehrengardt p. 94</ref>

=== War at sea ===

The war at sea was not a major part of Operation Exporter, but it did play a part.  During the [[Battle of the Litani River]], rough seas kept commandos from landing along the coast on the first day of battle.  In addition, on June 9, 1941, two French destroyers fired on the advancing Australians at the [[Litani River]] before being driven off by shore-based artillery fire.  The French destroyers, [[Gu<U+00E9>pard class destroyer|the ''Valmy'' and the ''Guepard'']], then exchanged fire with the British destroyer, [[HMS Janus (F53)|HMS ''Janus'']].  The New Zealand light cruiser [[HMNZS Leander|HMNZS ''Leander'']] came to the aid of the ''Janus'' along with six additional British destroyers and the French retired.<ref name="Pieka<U+0142>kiewicz, p. 144">Pieka<U+0142>kiewicz, p. 144</ref>

On June 15, with or without French approval, the German Air Force (''Luftwaffe'') attempted to come to the aid of the hard-pressed French naval forces.  [[Junkers Ju 88|Junkers JU-88s]] of II Wing, 1 Training Group, attacked British warships forces of the Syrian coast.  Hits were scored on two destroyers, the [[HMS Ilex (D61)|HMS ''Illex'']] and the [[HMS Isis (D87)|HMS ''Isis'']].  That evening, French aircraft of the 4th Naval Air Group bombed British naval units off of the Syrian coast.<ref name="Pieka<U+0142>kiewicz, p. 144"/>

Both the HMS ''Illex'' and the HMS ''Iris'' were towed to [[Haifa]] for repairs.  ''Iris'' returned to service soon thereafter.  The ''Illex'' underwent a series of temporary repairs at Haifa.  But other temporary repairs had to be made at [[Suez]], [[Aden]], [[Mombassa]], and [[Durban]] in order for ''Illex'' to reach the [[United States]] for a refit and full repair.

On June 16, British torpedo aircraft sank the French destroyer ''[[Vauquelin class destroyer|Chevalier Paul]]''.  The destroyer was on its way from [[Toulon]] to Syria carrying ammunition supplies from [[Metropolitan France]].  On the following day, British bombers attacked a second French destroyer in he port of Beirut.  This vessel too was carrying ammunition supplies.<ref name="Pieka<U+0142>kiewicz, p. 144"/>

On the night of June 22/23, the ''Guepard'' fought with two British cruisers and six destroyers off of the coast of Syria.  The French destroyer was able to retire under cover of darkness.<ref>Pieka<U+0142>kiewicz, p. 146</ref>

On June 25, the British submarine [[HMS Parthian (N75)|HMS ''Parthian'']] torpedoed and sank the French submarine ''Souffleur'' of the Syrian coast.  Shortly afterward, the French tanker ''Adour'' was attacked by British torpedo aircraft.  The ''Adour'' was carrying the entire fuel supply for the French forces in the Middle East.  The tanker was badly damaged.<ref>Pieka<U+0142>kiewicz, p. 147</ref>

During the ceasefire which started July 12, Dentz ordered ships and aircraft under his command to go to neutral [[Turkey]] where they were interned.

=== The end ===

On [[July 10]], as the Australian 21st Brigade was on the verge of entering Beirut, Dentz sought an armistice. At one minute past midnight on [[July 12]] a ceasefire came into effect. To all intents and purposes this ended the campaign and an armistice known as [[Armistice of Saint Jean d'Acre]] (also known as the "Convention of Acre") was signed on [[July 14]] at the "[[William Sidney Smith|Sidney Smith]] Barracks" on the outskirts of the city of [[Akko|Acre]].<ref>Time Magazine, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,765788,00.html Acre Pact]</ref>

== Aftermath ==

[[Image:AUS Sidon 1941.jpg|thumb|200px|Australian troops among the ruins of the old [[Crusades|Crusader]] castle at [[Sidon]], Lebanon, July 1941.]]

The [[Vichy French]] forces lost approximately 6,000 men.  Of these, roughly 1,000 had been killed.  This left 37,736 Vichy French prisoners of war.  But, when given the choice of being repatriated to [[Metropolitan France]] or joining the [[Free French]], only 5,668 men chose to join the forces of General [[Charles De Gaulle]]. <ref name="Mollo, p.144"/>

In late July 1941, De Gaulle flew from [[Brazzaville]] to personally congratulate the victors. <ref>Time Magazine, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,884370,00.html Reconquering an Empire]</ref>

Free French General [[Georges Catroux]] was placed in control of Syria and Lebanon.  On [[26 November]] [[1941]], shortly after taking up this post, Catroux recognised the independence of Syria and Lebanon in the name of the Free French movement.<ref>Time Magazine, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,849648,00.html Free Again]</ref>

On [[8 November]] [[1943]], after elections, Lebanon became an independent state.  On [[27 February]] [[1945]], it declared war on Germany and the [[Empire of Japan]].

Syria became independent on [[1 January]] [[1944]]. On [[26 February]] [[1945]], Syria declared war on Germany and Japan.

== Notable participants ==

In addition to the various military commanders already noted, the Syria-Lebanon Campaign had numerous participants who are worth noting.

=== Victoria Cross recipients ===

* [[Arthur Roden Cutler|Sir Arthur Roden Cutler]], later an Australian diplomat and Governor of New South  Wales. A Lieutenant at the time, Cutler was awarded the British Commonwealth's highest award for gallantry, the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC), for his actions at the [[Battle of Merdjayoun]]. Cutler lost a leg as a consequence of the fighting.
* [[James Heather Gordon|Jim Gordon]], Australian Private soldier, awarded the VC for his actions at the [[Battle of Jezzine (1941)|Battle of Jezzine]].
* [[Geoffrey Charles Tasker Keyes|Geoffrey Keyes]], celebrated British [[British Commandos|commando]] officer involved with the crossing of the [[Litani River]] and with operations against German General [[Erwin Rommel]] in [[North Africa]].  Keyes was awarded his VC posthumously.

=== Others ===

* [[Frank Horton Berryman|Frank Berryman]], later a prominent Australian General.
* [[Moshe Dayan]], later an Israeli General, who lost an eye while serving as an interpreter with an Australian unit. Dayan received the Military Cross for his actions in the campaign.

* [[Bobby Gibbes]], member of [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF]], who claimed the first of ten victories during the campaign and went on to become the squadron's longest-serving wartime commander.
* [[John Winthrop Hackett Junior|Sir John Hackett]], an Australian-born junior officer in the British Army at the time; prominent after the war as both a British General and author. Hackett was wounded during the campaign.
* [[Pierre Le Gloan]], French air ace, who served on the Vichy side during the campaign.  He shot down seven Allied aircraft.
* [[Paddy Mayne]], celebrated British [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) officer.
