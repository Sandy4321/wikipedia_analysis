'''Julie London''' (September 26, 1926&nbsp;<U+2013> October 18, 2000) was an American [[singing|singer]] and actress known for her smoky, sensual voice and languid demeanor. She released 32 albums of pop and jazz standards during the 1950s and 1960s, with her signature song being the classic "[[Cry Me a River]]," which she introduced in 1955. 

London's 35-year acting career began in films in 1944 and included playing opposite [[Gary Cooper]] in ''[[Man of the West]]'' (1958) and [[Robert Mitchum]] in ''[[The Wonderful Country]]'' (1959). She achieved continuing success in the TV [[medical drama]] ''[[Emergency!]]'' (1972<U+2013>1979), co-starring her real-life husband [[Bobby Troup]] and produced by her ex-husband [[Jack Webb]], in which London played the female lead role of nurse [[Dixie McCall]].

==Early life==
Julie London was born '''Gayle Peck''' in [[Santa Rosa, California]] in 1926, the daughter of Jack and Josephine Peck, who were a [[vaudeville]] song-and-dance team. In 1929, when she was only 3, her family moved to [[San Bernardino, California]], where Julie made her debut singing professionally on their public radio station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/person/julie-london?filter-options=tv |title=Julie London Profile |publisher=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=2012-12-15}}</ref> In 1941, when she was 14, the family moved to [[Hollywood, California]]. Shortly after that, she began appearing in movies. She graduated from the [[Hollywood Professional School]] in 1945.

==Marriages==
In 1947 London married actor [[Jack Webb]] (of ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]'' fame).  This pairing arose from their mutual love for [[jazz]].<ref>Staggs, Sam. (2003) ''Close-Up on Sunset Boulevard'' "St. Martin's Press" p. 289. ISBN 0-312-30254-1.</ref> They had two daughters: Stacy and Lisa Webb. London and Webb divorced in 1954. Daughter Stacy Webb was killed in a traffic accident in 1996.

In 1959 London married jazz [[composer]] and musician [[Bobby Troup]], and they remained married until his death in 1999. They had one daughter, Kelly Troup, who died in 2002, and twin sons, Jody and Reese Troup.  Jody Troup died in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/672/000107351/ |title=Julie London |publisher=Nndb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608002890/Julie-London.html |title=Julie London Biography |publisher=Musicianguide.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref>

==Career==

===Singing===
London began singing under the name '''Gayle Peck''' in public in her teens before appearing in a film. She was discovered by [[talent agent]], [[Sue Carol]] (wife of actor [[Alan Ladd]]), while working as an elevator operator. Her early film career, however, did not include any singing roles.

London recorded 32 albums in a career that began in 1955 with a live performance at the 881 Club in Los Angeles.<ref>McKnight-Trontz, Jennifer (1999) ''Exotiquarium: Album Art from the Space Age'' "St. Martin's Press" p. 77. ISBN 0-312-20133-8.</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named her the most popular female vocalist for 1955, 1956, and 1957. She was the subject of a 1957 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' cover article in which she was quoted as saying, "It's only a thimbleful of a voice, and I have to use it close to the microphone. But it is a kind of oversmoked voice, and it automatically sounds intimate.<ref>"A Small Voice Makes Big Stir" Life, February 18, 1957, p. 74.</ref>

London's debut recordings were for the [[Bethlehem Records]] label. While shopping for a record deal, she recorded four tracks that would later be included on the compilation album, ''Bethlehem's Girlfriends'', in 1955. Bobby Troup backed London on the album, for which London recorded the standards, "Don't Worry About Me", "[[Motherless Child]]", "[[A Foggy Day]]", and "[[You're Blas<U+00E9>]]".

London's most famous single, "[[Cry Me a River]]", was written by her [[high school|high-school]] classmate, [[Arthur Hamilton]], and produced by Troup.<ref>Cason, Buzz (2004) ''Living the Rock 'N' Roll Dream: The Adventures of [[Buzz Cason]]'' "Hal Leonard". p. 102. ISBN 0-634-06672-2.</ref>  The recording became a million-seller after its release in December 1955 and also sold on re-issue in April 1983 from the attention brought by a [[Mari Wilson]] [[cover version|cover]].  London performed the song in the film ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'' (1956), and her recording gained later attention in the films ''[[Passion of Mind]]'' (2000) and [[V for Vendetta (film)|''V for Vendetta'']] (2006). 
The song "[[Yummy Yummy Yummy]]" was featured on the [[HBO]] television series ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' and appears on its [[soundtrack album]]. London's "Must Be Catchin'" was featured in the 2011 premiere episode of the ABC series ''[[Pan Am (TV series)|Pan Am]]. Her last recording was "[[My Funny Valentine]]" for the soundtrack of the Burt Reynolds film ''[[Sharky's Machine (film)|Sharky's Machine]]'' (1981).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0518728/bio|title=Julie London - Biography|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2012-12-15}}</ref>

Other popular singles include "Hot Toddy", "Daddy", and "Desafinado".  Recordings such as "Go Slow" epitomized her career style: her voice is slow, smoky, and playfully sensual.

===Film===
Though primarily remembered as a singer, London also made more than 20 films. Her widely regarded beauty and poise (she was a [[pinup girl]] prized by [[GI (military)|GI]]s during [[World War II]]) contrasted strongly with her pedestrian appearance and streetwise acting technique (much parodied by impersonators). One of her strongest performances came in ''[[Man of the West]]'' (1958), starring [[Gary Cooper]] and directed by [[Anthony Mann]], in which her character, the film's only woman, is abused and humiliated by an [[outlaw]] [[gang]].

===Television===
She performed on many television [[variety show|variety series]] and also in dramatic roles, including guest appearances on ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' (1960) and ''[[The Big Valley]]'' (1968). Her ex-husband, Webb, was [[executive producer]] for the series ''[[Emergency!]],'' and in 1972 he hired both his ex-wife and her husband, Troup, for key roles. London received second-billing as head nurse, [[Dixie McCall]], while Troup received third-billing as [[emergency room|emergency-room]] [[physician]], Dr. [[Joe Early]]. She and her co-stars, a familiar actor and best friend of London's, [[Robert Fuller (actor)|Robert Fuller]] as head physician Dr. [[Kelly Brackett]], along with unfamiliar actors [[Randolph Mantooth]] as paramedic [[John Gage]], and [[Kevin Tighe]] as paramedic [[Roy DeSoto]], also appeared in an episode of the Webb-produced series, ''[[Adam-12]]'', reprising their roles.  London and Troup appeared as [[panelist]]s on the [[game show]] ''[[Tattletales]]'' several times in the 1970s. In the 1950s London appeared in an advertisement for [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro cigarettes]] singing the "Marlboro Song", and in 1978 appeared in television advertisements for Rose Milk Skin Care Cream.

==Later life and death==
London suffered a [[stroke]] in 1995, and was in poor health until her death on October 18, 2000 (the day her husband, [[Bobby Troup]], would have been 82), in [[Encino, Los Angeles, California|Encino]], California, at age 74. London was interred next to Troup in the Courts of Remembrance, Columbarium of Providence, at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery]] in Los Angeles, California. Her star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] is at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles.
