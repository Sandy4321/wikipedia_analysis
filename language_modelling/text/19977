A '''tax increment reinvestment zone (TIRZ)''' is a political subdivision of a [[municipality]] or [[county]] in the state of [[Texas]] created to implement [[tax increment financing]]. They may be initiated by the city or county or by petition of owners whose total holdings in the zone consist of a majority of the appraised property value. <ref name="Tierra Grande">{{citeweb|url=http://recenter.tamu.edu/pdf/1736.pdf|title=ABCs of TIF|accessdate=March 15, 2010}}</ref>

== Creation ==
There are 3 steps involved in the creation of a TIRZ:
# Property owners possessing 50% or more of the appraised value of a district submit a petition to the county, city, or town requesting a TIRZ be set up, or the local government may decide to create one. A specific lifetime for the TIRZ is determined. A TIRZ may only be city-initiated if less than 10% of its land area consists of residential area.<ref name="COH">{{citeweb|url=http://www.houstontx.gov/finance/ecodev/tirz.html|title=City of Houston: Tax Increment Reinvestment Zones|accessdate=March 15, 2010}}</ref>
# For the purposes of existing tax-collecting entities (water districts, counties, etc) the assessed values of properties within the new TIRZ are frozen. It is assumed that property values will increase over the lifetime of the TIRZ; the property taxes collected on this increase constitute the "increment".<ref name="Tierra Grande" />
# Local taxing authorities besides the creating organization negotiate for how much of the tax increment they will donate to the fund instead of keeping for themselves. <ref name="Tierra Grande" />
# The municipality or county passes an ordinance establishing a governing board for the TIRZ and the zone as a legal entity itself. The board then meets to create a budget for the lifetime of the zone, establishing what projects it will undertake and how they will be financed. This plan is passed as another ordinance.<ref name="Tierra Grande" />

== Legal influences ==
A TIRZ may not simply be created without justification. In its current state, the area must have a deleterious effect on the economic future of the creating body.
<blockquote>[The area must] substantially arrest or impair the sound growth of the municipality or county creating the zone, retard the provision of housing accommodations, or constitute an economic or social liability and be a menace to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare in its present condition and use...<ref name="COH" /></blockquote>
However, this does not restrict the use of TIRZs to poor areas. Among the conditions justifying creation of a TIRZ is "the predominance of defective or inadequate sidewalk or street layout,"<ref name="COH" /> and wealthy areas may be included in a TIRZ; for example, [[Uptown Houston]] is a TIRZ.<ref name="UH">{{citeweb|url=http://www.uptown-houston.com/info/maps.html#|title=Uptown Maps|accessdate=March 15, 2010}}</ref>
