The '''Siege of St. Augustine''' was an action in [[Queen Anne's War]] conducted by [[Kingdom of England|English]] provincial forces from the [[Province of Carolina]] and their native allies, under the command of Carolina's governor [[James Moore (South Carolina politician)|James Moore]], against the [[Spain|Spanish]] colonial fortress of [[Castillo de San Marcos]] at [[Saint Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], in [[Spanish Florida]].  The siege began on 10 November 1702, and was raised on 30 December following the arrival of a Spanish fleet from [[Havana, Cuba]].

==Background==
British and Spanish colonization efforts in southeastern North America began coming into conflict as early as the middle of the 17th century.  The founding in 1670 by the British of Charles Town (present-day [[Charleston, South Carolina]])in the recently-established (1663) [[Province of Carolina]] heightened tensions.<ref name="Arnade, p. 31">Arnade, p. 31</ref>  Traders, raiders, and slavers from the new province penetrated into [[Spanish Florida]], leading to raiding and reprisal expeditions on both sides.<ref name=C381>Crane, p. 381</ref>  In 1700, Carolina's governor, [[Joseph Blake (governor)|Joseph Blake]], threatened the Spanish that English claims to [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], established in 1698, would be enforced.<ref name=C384>Crane, p. 384</ref>  Blake's death later that year interrupted these plans, and he was replaced in 1702 by [[James Moore (South Carolina politician)|James Moore]].<ref name=C384/>

Even before news of the war declarations opening the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] arrived in the colonies, Moore proposed an expedition against Spanish Florida's capital, [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]].<ref name=C385>Crane, p. 385</ref>  News of the outbreak of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] arrived in 1702, and Moore convinced the provincial assembly in September 1702 to fund an expedition against [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]].  Moore raised a force of 500 colonists and 450 Indians, the latter a combination of [[Yamasee]], [[Tallapoosa]], and [[Alabama (tribe)|Alabama]] warriors.<ref>Higginbotham, p. 114</ref>  Some of this force, primarily Indians, went overland to the south under the command of Deputy Governor [[Robert Daniel (Carolina colonist)|Robert Daniel]], while Moore embarked the rest of the force on 14 boats and sailed for [[Matanzas Bay]].<ref name=O47>Oatis, p. 47</ref>  Daniel's forces destroyed mission towns in the [[Guale Province]] of Spanish Florida (present-day coastal south Georgia), and refugees and runners from this action alerted St. Augustine to the expedition's progress.

The [[Castillo de San Marcos]] at St. Augustine was built in the later years of the 17th century, in part because previous English raids demonstrated the inadequacy of wooden fortifications, and to address the threat posed by the founding of Charles Town.<ref name="Arnade, p. 31"/>  The fortress, a fairly conventional [[star fort]], was constructed from [[coquina]] limestone, a local material that turned out to be remarkably resilient against the fire of small cannons.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  Governor [[Joseph de Z<U+00FA><U+00F1>iga y Z<U+00E9>rda]] assumed command of his post in 1700.<ref>Arnade, p. 32</ref>  Natives friendly to the Spanish heard of the recruitment, and word of the expedition reached Z<U+00FA><U+00F1>iga on October 27.<ref name=Hof176>Hoffman, p. 176</ref>  He ordered the town's inhabitants into the fort, commandeered all food stores in anticipation of an extended siege, and dispatched messengers to Pensacola, [[Havana, Cuba|Havana]], and the French at [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] with calls for assistance.<ref name=Hof176/>  Refugees swelled the civilian population to about 1,500;<ref name=B192>Bushnell, p. 192</ref> of the 412 males in this population, only 174 had military experience.<ref name=Hof177>Hoffman, p. 177</ref>

==Siege==
Moore's fleet arrived at the mouth of Matanzas Bay in early November.  Some of his ships had too deep a draft to cross the bar, so only eight ships entered the bay; troops were disembarked from the others and eventually transported by those ships to St. Augustine.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  On November 10 the siege got underway.  Moore had brought four small cannon, but these made little impression on the coquina walls of the fortress, and the Spanish guns had longer range, keeping most of his forces at bay.<ref name=B192/><ref name=O48>Oatis, p. 48</ref> Moore dispatched Deputy Governor Daniel to Jamaica for larger cannons and ammunition.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Since his cannons were not effective against the fort's walls, Moore attempted a deception to gain entry to the fort.  A Yamasee couple managed to gain entry to the fort posing as refugees, apparently with the goal of detonating the fort's powder magazine.  However, Z<U+00FA><U+00F1>iga was suspicious of their behavior and, according to his account of the siege, they were tortured into admitting the plot.<ref name=B192/>

The arrival of four ships caused both sides great excitement.  When the Spanish flag was spotted flying, Moore decided it was time to abandon the siege.<ref name=B192/>  Since the arriving fleet had blockaded the bay's mouth, he burned the eight ships he had brought into the bay, and retreated overland until his force could be picked up by the remaining ships.  The expedition returned to Charles Town in disgrace.

==Aftermath==
Moore was forced to resign his post as governor because of the failed raid,<ref>Arnade, p. 33</ref> and its cost (which included compensating owners for the loss of their ships) caused riots in Charles Town.<ref name=B193>Bushnell, p. 193</ref>  Some of Moore's contemporary critics accused him of executing the raid for the purpose of seizing slaves or booty; the Spanish characterized it in religious terms, citing the "English provincial hatred against the Church of God."<ref>Crane, p. 386</ref>  Moore continued to be active in the war, leading a small number of Carolinians and a large band of Indians on [[Apalachee massacre|the destruction of Spanish missions]] in Florida in 1704.

Governor Z<U+00FA><U+00F1>iga was rewarded for his successful defense with promotion to the more prestigious and desirable governorship of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]].<ref>Daniels, p. 32</ref>  Spanish and French forces, motivated and organized by [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] (who died shortly before its departure), [[Charles Town expedition|attempted the capture]] of Charles Town in August 1706; their attempts to land forces were successfully repulsed.
