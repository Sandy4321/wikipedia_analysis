'''Dixie Chicks''' are a [[country music|country]]/[[rock music]] [[trio (music)|trio]] from the [[United States]] comprising [[Emily Robison]], [[Martie Maguire]] and [[Natalie Maines]]. They are the highest-selling [[All-women band|female band]] in any musical genre, having sold 36 million albums as of June 2006.<ref>[http://www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=20782 Media Consolidation Couldn<U+2019>t Kill the Dixie Chicks], [http://www.dixiechicks.com/06_pressDetail.asp?newsID=640 Adelaide Mail (Australia): Not Ready to Make Nice], [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/06/15/bmdixie15.xml How the Chicks survived their scrap with Bush, The Telegraph, June 15, 2006 ].</ref><!--Note to editors: Among [[Girl group|female groups]] (a band also plays the music) the Chicks are outsold by [[Destiny's Child]] and [[Spice Girls]].--><ref>http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTopArt</ref>

The group formed in [[1989]] in [[Dallas, Texas]]. After years of struggle and personal tribulations, Dixie Chicks achieved massive country and [[pop music|pop]] success starting in the late 1990s with hit songs such as "[[Wide Open Spaces]]", "[[Cowboy Take Me Away]]", and "[[Long Time Gone]]". The women became well-known for their lively persona, instrumental virtuosity, soaring ballads, fashion sense and outspoken political comments. [[As of 2007]], they have won 13 [[Grammy Award]]s. 

Ten days before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], lead vocalist Natalie Maines publicly criticized [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]]. The ensuing controversy cost the group half of their concert audience attendance in the United States<ref>{{cite web | url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/14822593/ | title=Dixie Chicks <U+2018>Shut Up and Sing<U+2019> in Toronto | publisher=MSNBC | accessdate=2006-10-08}}</ref> as chronicled in the 2006 documentary ''[[Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing]]''.

At the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|49th Grammy Awards Show]] in 2007, the group won all [[#Grammy Awards|five categories]] for which they were nominated, including the coveted Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Album of the Year, in a vote that Maines interpreted as being a show of public support for their advocacy of free speech and their early disapproval of the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.<ref>Natalie Maines: "I think people are using their freedom of speech with all these awards. We get the message." [http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070212/FEATURES/70212001/1015/FEATURES10 Dixie Chicks lead Grammys with 5 awards], Herald Tribune.</ref>

==Early incarnations==
Dixie Chicks was founded by the sisters [[Martie Erwin|Martie]] and [[Emily Erwin]] along with [[Laura Lynch]] and [[Robin Lynn Macy]]. The Erwin sisters have since married and changed their names to Martie Maguire and Emily Robison, respectively. The Erwin sisters provided the instrumental firepower for the band while Lynch and Macy were the lead singers. All four original members of Dixie Chicks graduated from [[Greenhill School (Addison, Texas)|Greenhill School]] in [[Addison, Texas]], a suburb of [[Dallas]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The group began with a largely [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] sound, and released their first album ''[[Thank Heavens for Dale Evans]]'' (named after the pioneering, multi-talented female performer [[Dale Evans]]) on independent label [[Crystal Clear Sound]] in 1990. The album included two instrumentals, showing the group's strength; Martie had taken third place at the National Fiddle Championships the year before. The Chicks gained some positive notices, winning the best band prize at the [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]] and earning opening act spots in support of [[Garth Brooks]], [[Reba McEntire]], and [[George Strait]], but found little airplay outside of [[public radio]]. 

The Chicks released the Christmas single "Home on the Radar Range" in late 1991, and their second album, ''[[Little Ol' Cowgirl]]'', in 1992. [[Steel guitar]] legend [[Lloyd Maines]] played on both of these, and portions of the second album contained a more contemporary country sound. Dixie Chicks continued to appear at various events in the Texas and Nashville areas, gaining positive critical reviews but sparing commercial success outside of some Dallas area radio airplay.

Robin Lynn Macy left in late 1992, for a "purer" bluegrass approach, and remained active in the Dallas music scene.  

Now a trio, the Chicks released their third album in 1993. ''[[Shouldn't a Told You That]]'' featured Lynch as the sole lead singer and pushed bluegrass to the background. Despite constant touring and appearances at higher-profile events such as President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Inauguration]] and the national television show ''[[CBS This Morning]]'', no hit song emerged and a commercial breakthrough eluded the Chicks.<ref>[[Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing]]</ref>

==A new singer and commercial success==
Laura Lynch was replaced in late 1995 by [[Natalie Maines]], the daughter of producer, [[steel guitar]] player, and former Chicks' session player [[Lloyd Maines]]. Around the same time, [[Sony]] scouted the Chicks and signed them to the newly revived [[Monument Records]] label.   
[[Image:Dixie Chicks - Wide Open Spaces.jpg|left|thumb|200px|"[[Wide Open Spaces]]" (1998), is the first album released after the original lead vocalist [[Laura Lynch]] was replaced by [[Natalie Maines]], the album was the biggest commercial success and sold 12 million copies in U.S.]]
The new Dixie Chicks lineup consisted of group leader Martie (Erwin) Siedel ([[fiddle]], [[mandolin]] and [[vocals]]), Emily Erwin ([[guitar]], [[dobro]], [[banjo]] and vocals), and Natalie Maines ([[lead vocals|lead vocal]] and in concerts, guitar).  Natalie added a strong and distinctive voice to the sisters' musicianship and [[harmony]] vocals, and the combination clicked.

A single "I Can Love You Better" was released in October 1997 with major label promotion. It climbed into the Top 10 on the country music charts. The album ''[[Wide Open Spaces]]'' was released in January 1998. Over the space of a year, the next three singles from ''Wide Open Spaces'' all hit No. 1 on the country charts: the bouncy "[[There's Your Trouble]]," the statement-of-purpose song, "Wide Open Spaces," and the radio-pleasing ballad "You Were Mine". ''Wide Open Spaces'' went on to sell more than 12 million copies, becoming one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|50 best-selling albums in American history]]. In the summer of 1999, Dixie Chicks served as the opening act for [[Tim McGraw]]'s concert tour.

Dixie Chicks further proved themselves with another smash hit album, ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]'' in 1999. Nine singles emerged from it, including country No. 1's "[[Cowboy Take Me Away]]" and "[[Without You (Dixie Chicks song)|Without You]]." ''Fly'' went on to sell 10 million copies, a rare repeat [[diamond album]]. Already performing in [[arenas]], the band also staged the [[Fly Tour]], their first as the headlining act.

The source of Dixie Chicks' commercial success during this time came from various factors: they wrote or co-wrote about half of the songs on ''Wide Open Spaces'' and ''Fly''; their mixture of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and mainstream [[country music]] appealed to a wide spectrum of record buyers; their visual image, which changed from the [[cowgirl]] look with the addition of Maines to a variety of styles of dress, which further enhanced their general appeal; and lyrically, the Chicks' ethos struck a resonance with the public:
:: ''She needs wide open spaces''
:: ''Room to make her big mistakes''
This romantic, adventurous sense of independence was a major theme in the first two Dixie Chicks albums featuring Maines as the lead singer. Focus on romanticism is also strongly evident in "Cowboy Take Me Away," another of their [[signature song]]s. 

The Chicks also delivered gleeful revenge epics such as "[[Goodbye Earl]]," the tale of a woman who murders her abusive husband and gets away with it, or raucous, [[ribald]] numbers such as "Sin Wagon," a concert staple rave-up. Both of these tracks contained thematic elements that led to some radio stations removing the Chicks from their playlists, but the group was consistently unapologetic.

==Continued success with a "non-commercial" sound==
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:tributetoheroes1.jpg|frame|right|''[[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]'' main web page.]] -->
Dixie Chicks debuted their quiet, unadorned song "I Believe in Love" on the ''[[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]'' telethon following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. It was a harbinger of a change in musical direction.

Dixie Chicks became involved in a dispute with their record label regarding royalties and accounting procedures. After the trio quit in disgust, Sony sued the group for failure to complete their contract. The group countersued.<ref>http://www.aimeemanninprint.com/2001/bg100701.htm</ref>

After the two parties reconciled their differences, ''[[Home (Dixie Chicks album)|Home]]'', independently produced by Lloyd Maines, was released in 2002. For tracks not written by the group, outside songwriters were solicited for personal songs that were considered "uncommercial". Unlike the Chicks' two previous records, ''Home'' was recorded without drums and is dominated by very up-tempo bluegrass and pensive ballads. In addition, the lyrics of the opening track and first single, "[[Long Time Gone]]," explicitly attacked contemporary country music radio, accusing it of ignoring the soul of the genre as exemplified by [[Merle Haggard]], [[Johnny Cash]], and [[Hank Williams]].

"[[Long Time Gone]]" became the Chicks' first top ten hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|U.S. pop singles chart]] and peaked at #2 on the country chart, becoming a major success. Over six million copies of ''Home'' were sold in the U.S.<ref>http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/search_results.asp</ref>

In [[2003]], they gave a performance of [[The Star-Spangled Banner]] at [[Super Bowl XXXVII]].

The group's independent spirit was alive and well in their cover of [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s "[[Landslide (song)|Landslide]]," which duplicated the top ten country and pop achievements. However, a key track from ''Home'' contrasted with past albums; a rendering of [[Patty Griffin]]'s "[[Top of the World (Dixie Chicks song)|Top of the World]]," for which the subsequent tour was named, featured a startlingly unusual point of view and sought to portray an almost unbearable sense of regret.

''Home'' dominated the [[Grammy Awards of 2003|2003 Grammy Awards]] by winning four awards, including:
*[[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]]
*[[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance|Best Country Instrumental Performance]]
**Dixie Chicks for "Lil' Jack Slade"
*[[Grammy Award for Best Country Album|Best Country Album]]
**[[Lloyd Maines]] (producer), [[Gary Paczosa]] (engineer/mixer) & the Dixie Chicks (producers & artists) for ''[[Home (Dixie Chicks album)|Home]]''.

Tickets for the associated [[Top of the World Tour]] often sold out within hours.

==Political controversy==

{{splitsection|Dixie Chicks Political controversy}}

During the run-up to the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]], several weeks after their Grammy success, Dixie Chicks performed in concert in London on [[March 10]], [[2003]], at the [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]] theatre.  During this concert, the band gave a monologue to introduce their song ''Travelin' Soldier,'' during which Natalie Maines, a [[Texas]] native, was quoted by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as saying, "Just so you know, [...] we're ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas."<ref name=Guardian2>Clarke, Betty (2003). [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,,912236,00.html "The Dixie Chicks"] ''Guardian Unlimited'' (accessed January 22, 2007)</ref>  Though this is the official circulation of the comment, the full text of the statement Natalie Maines made was as follows:

{{cquote|''Just so you know, we<U+2019>re on the good side with y<U+2019>all. We do not want this war, this violence, and we<U+2019>re ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas.''|4=Natalie Maines|5=<ref name=DemocracyNow>Democracy Now! (2007).

(accessed February 24, 2007)</ref>}}

Directly after Natalie's statements on stage, co-band member Emily Robison reportedly remarked that the band supported the American troops 100 percent.<ref name=MetroactiveMusic>Sarah Quelland (2003). [http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/07.10.03/dixie-0328.html "Whistlin' Dixie"] Metroactive Music (accessed February 24, 2007)</ref>

The comment about [[U.S. President|President]] [[George W. Bush|Bush]], who had moved to [[Texas]] from [[Connecticut]] at age two, was reported in ''[[The Guardian]]'''s review of the Chicks concert.<ref name=Guardian2/> Shortly thereafter, the U.S. media picked up the story and controversy erupted.<ref name=Guardian3>Campbell, Duncan (2003). [http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,943170,00.html "'Dixie sluts' fight on with naked defiance"] ''Guardian Unlimited'' (accessed April 13, 2006)</ref>  

Maines' remark sparked intense criticism; many Americans believed that she should not criticize George Bush on foreign shores. Maines insists, however, "I said it there 'cause that's where I was."<ref>http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,1196419,00.html</ref>

The comment angered many country music fans and was financially damaging. Following the uproar and the start of a [[boycott]] of Dixie Chicks' music, Maines attempted to clarify matters on March 12 by saying, "I feel the President is ignoring the opinions of many in the U.S. and alienating the rest of the world." <ref>http://www.thebostonchannel.com/entertainment/2040104/detail.html</ref>

The statement failed to quiet her critics, and Maines issued an apology on [[March 14]]: "As a concerned American citizen, I apologize to President Bush because my remark was disrespectful. I feel that whoever holds that office should be treated with the utmost respect. We are currently in Europe and witnessing a huge anti-American sentiment as a result of the perceived rush to war. While war may remain a viable option, as a mother, I just want to see every possible alternative exhausted before children and American soldiers' lives are lost. I love my country. I am a proud American."<ref name=BBCNEWS>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2867221.stm Dixies dropped over Bush remark], ''BBC News'', March 20, 2003 (Accessed: October 30, 2006)</ref><ref name=CNN> [http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/14/dixie.chicks.apology/index.html "Dixie Chicks singer apologizes for Bush comment"] ''CNN'', March 14, 2003  (Accessed: April 09, 2007)</ref>

While some people were disappointed that Maines apologized at all, others dropped their support of Dixie Chicks and their sponsor [[Lipton]]. In one famous anti-Dixie Chicks display, former fans were encouraged to bring their CDs to a demonstration at which they would be crushed by a [[bulldozer]]. The degree of hatred directed toward the Chicks - including death threats<ref>http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,426213,00.html</ref> - provoked concern among the band about their safety and that of their families. [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] even felt compelled to come out in support of the right of the band to express their opinions freely.<ref>[http://www.nbc6.net/entertainment/2156255/detail.html Springsteen: Dixie Chicks 'Getting A Raw Deal'], NBC6.net. Last accessed on February 17, 2007.</ref>  (Although Madonna herself was pressured to postpone and then alter the [[April 1]] release of her "[[American Life (song)|American Life]]" video in which she threw a [[hand grenade]] toward a Bush look-alike, after witnessing the backlash against the Chicks.)<ref>http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/music/feature/2003/04/03/madonna/index.html</ref>

One significant exception to the criticism of Dixie Chicks from the realm of country music was country music veteran and strident Iraq war opponent [[Merle Haggard]], who in the summer of 2003 released a song critical of US media coverage of the Iraq War. Haggard said the attack on the Chicks was a "witch-hunt and lynching." On July 25 2003, the Associated Press reported him saying: 

{{cquote|''I don't even know the Dixie chicks, but I find it an insult for all the men and women who fought and died in past wars when almost the majority of America jumped down their throats for voicing an opinion. It was like a verbal witch-hunt and lynching.|4=Merle Haggard|5[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0725-02.htm][http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/07/25/entertainment/main565038.shtml]}}

[[Image:Ewdixiechicks.jpg|The Dixie Chicks featured on the [[May 2]], [[2003]] cover of ''Entertainment Weekly''.|225px|thumb]]
On [[April 24]], Dixie Chicks launched a publicity campaign to explain their position. During a prime-time interview with TV personality [[Diane Sawyer]], Maines said she remained proud of her original statement. The band also appeared [[naked]] (with private parts strategically covered) on the [[May 2]] cover of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine with slogans such as "Traitors," "Saddam's Angels," "Dixie Sluts", "Proud Americans," "Hero," "Free Speech", and "Brave" printed on their bodies. The slogans represented the labels (both positive and negative) that had been placed on them in the [[aftermath]] of Maines's statement.

[[George W. Bush|President Bush]] responded to the controversy surrounding Dixie Chicks in an interview with [[Tom Brokaw]] on [[April 24]]: 
{{cquote|''The Dixie Chicks are free to speak their mind. They can say what they want to say ... they shouldn't have their feelings hurt just because some people don't want to buy their records when they speak out ... Freedom is a two-way street ... I don't really care what the Dixie Chicks said. I want to do what I think is right for the American people, and if some singers or Hollywood stars feel like speaking out, that's fine. That's the great thing about America. It stands in stark contrast to Iraq...''<ref name=TIME>(2003). http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/25/international/worldspecial/25BUSH-TEXT.html?pagewanted=all (accessed April 13, 2006)</ref>}}

At the first concert of their nationwide [[Top of the World Tour]] Dixie Chicks received a positive reception. The concert was held in [[Greenville, South Carolina]] on [[May 1]], and was attended by a sell-out crowd of 15,000 (tickets for most of the shows had gone on sale before the controversy erupted<ref>CMT, [http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/dixie_chicks/bio.jhtml Dixie Chicks biography] (accessed December 3, 2006)</ref>). The women arrived prepared to face opposition <U+2014> and Maines invited those who had come to boo to do so <U+2014> but the crowd erupted mostly in cheers.

Nevertheless, a Colorado radio station suspended two of its disc jockeys on [[May 6]] for playing music by the Dixie Chicks.<ref>[http://www.nbc6.net/entertainment/2185232/detail.html ''Radio Jocks Suspended For Playing Dixie Chicks''], NBC6.net. Last accessed [[February 15]], [[2007]]</ref> On [[May 22]], at the [[Academy of Country Music]] (ACM) awards ceremony in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], there were boos when the group's nomination for Entertainer of the Year award was announced. However, the broadcast's host, [[Vince Gill]], reminded the audience that everyone is entitled to freedom of speech. The Academy gave the award to [[Toby Keith]], an outspoken critic of the group who had received criticism for displaying a backdrop at his concerts showing a doctored photo of Maines with Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein]]<ref>http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12061487</ref>.

In the fall of 2003 Dixie Chicks starred in a broadcast TV commercial for [[Lipton Original Iced Tea]], which made a tongue-in-cheek reference to the corporate blacklisting and the grassroots backlash. In the commercial, the Chicks are about to give a stadium concert when the electricity suddenly goes out. They continue anyway, performing an ''[[a cappella]]'' version of "Cowboy Take Me Away" to the raving cheers of the fans.
[[Image:DixieChicksMSG062003.jpg|thumb|left|274px|Dixie Chicks performing at [[Madison Square Garden]] on [[June 20]], [[2003]] during ''[[Top of the World Tour]]''.]]
In a September 2003 interview, Maguire told the German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'': "We don't feel a part of the country scene any longer, it can't be our home anymore." She noted a lack of support from country stars, and being shunned at the 2003 ACM awards. "Instead, we won three Grammys against much stronger competition. So we now consider ourselves part of the big rock 'n' roll family." However, in an open letter to fans on the Chicks' [[website]], Maines said Maguire had been misquoted.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Also in 2003, the [[American Red Cross]] refused a 1 million USD offer from the Dixie Chicks. The organization did not publicize the refusal; it was revealed by the Chicks themselves in a May 2006 interview on [[The Howard Stern Show]] on [[SIRIUS Satellite Radio]].<ref>http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1148540400</ref> According to National Red Cross spokesperson Julie Thurmond Whitmer, the band would have made the donation "only if the American Red Cross would embrace the band's summer tour," writes Ms. Whitmer, referring to the group's 2003 U.S. tour after the London incident.
{{cquote|''The Dixie Chicks controversy made it impossible for the American Red Cross to associate itself with the band because such association would have violated two of the founding principles of the organization: impartiality and neutrality...Should the Dixie Chicks like to make an unconditional financial donation to the American Red Cross, we will gladly accept it.''<ref>http://www.pe.com/sharedcontent/features/country2/052806ccdrMUSICnatalie.3a3fb996.html</ref>}}

In October 2004, Dixie Chicks joined the [[Vote for Change]] tour, performing in concerts organized by [[MoveOn.org]] in [[swing states]].  While Dixie Chicks' artistic collaborations with [[James Taylor]] went well, sharing the stage on many occasions, Maines's comments during the concerts revealed a certain amount of nervousness over the future career path of Dixie Chicks.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

In June 2006 an article in the [[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]] quoted Emily Robison on the lack of support from other country music performers, "A lot of artists cashed in on being against what we said or what we stood for because that was promoting their career, which was a horrible thing to do." Robison continued, "A lot of pandering started going on, and you'd see soldiers and the American flag in every video. It became a sickening display of ultra-patriotism." Maines commented, "The entire country may disagree with me, but I don't understand the necessity for patriotism. Why do you have to be a patriot? About what? This land is our land? Why? You can like where you live and like your life, but as for loving the whole country ... I don't see why people care about patriotism."<ref name=Telegraph>(2006).

{{wikinewspar|Dixie Chicks show documentary at TIFF}}
At the [[2006 Toronto International Film Festival]], [[Cabin Creek Films]], the production company of award-winning documentarian [[Barbara Kopple]], premiered ''[[Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing]]''. Distributed by the [[Weinstein Company]], the documentary follows the Chicks over the three years since the 2003 London concert remark.

In 2007 Natalie Maines appeared in the documentary ''Pete Seeger: the Power of Song''. She gives commentary on [[Pete Seeger|Seeger's]] censorship throughout the 1950s and 1960s from the perspective of her own experiences with censorship.

==''Not Ready to Make Nice'': The Chicks return==

In September 2005 Dixie Chicks debuted their song "[[I Hope]]" on the ''[[Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast]]'' telethon following [[Hurricane Katrina]], and subsequently made it available as a digital download single with proceeds to benefit hurricane relief.

On [[March 16]], [[2006]], Dixie Chicks released the single "[[Not Ready to Make Nice]]" in advance of their upcoming album.  Written by all three Chicks alongside [[Dan Wilson (musician)|Dan Wilson]], it directly addressed the political controversy that had surrounded the group for the past three years: <div style="clear:both;"></div>
:''I<U+2019>m not ready to make nice
:''I<U+2019>m not ready to back down
:''I<U+2019>m still mad as hell and I don<U+2019>t have time to go 'round and 'round and 'round
:''It<U+2019>s too late to make it right
:''I probably wouldn<U+2019>t if I could
:''<U+2018>Cause I<U+2019>m mad as hell
:''Can<U+2019>t bring myself to do what it is you think I should'' 
and, in criticism of the death threats the women (particularly Maines) received, 
:''It<U+2019>s a sad sad story when a mother will teach her 
:''Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
:''And how in the world can the words that I said
:''Send somebody so over the edge 
:''That they<U+2019>d write me a letter 
:''Sayin<U+2019> that I better
:''Shut up and sing or my life will be over''
In a press release, Robison said, "The stakes were definitely higher on that song. We knew it was special because it was so autobiographical, and we had to get it right. And once we had that song done, it freed us up to do the rest of the album without that burden." 

The question of how the group's new record would fare commercially attracted intense media interest.
[[Image:TakingtheLongWay.jpg|left|thumb|200px|''[[Taking the Long Way]]'' (2006), is the first album release after "the incident," and includes the hit single "[[Not Ready to Make Nice]]"]]
The Chicks' new album, titled ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'', was released in stores and online [[May 22]], [[2006]]. The album was produced by [[Rick Rubin]] (who had worked with [[Linkin Park]], [[Metallica]], the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Danzig]], [[System Of A Down]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Neil Diamond]], and the [[Beastie Boys]] among others) and was publicized to be more rock-intensive than country-oriented.<ref name=blogcritics>Barger, Al (2006).

[http://music.msn.com/artist/?artist=16097852 "Dixie Chicks: 'Taking the Long Way'"] ''MSN.com'' (accessed April 13, 2006)</ref>  All 14 tracks were co-written by the three Chicks, alongside various other songwriters.
The album contained additional tracks that seemed to indirectly reference what the group called "The Incident", and the group remained defiant. For instance, in the [[May 29]] issue of ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'', Maguire said, "I'd rather have a smaller following of really cool people who get it, who will grow with us as we grow and are fans for life, than people that have us in their five-disc changer with Reba McEntire and Toby Keith. We don't want those kinds of fans. They limit what you can do." Maines also retracted her earlier apology to Bush, stating, "I apologized for disrespecting the office of the President, but I don't feel that way anymore. I don't feel he is owed any respect whatsoever."<ref>{{cite news |

In Europe, both singles from their ''Taking the Long Way'' were well received by country radio, remaining on the European Country Charts for more than 20 weeks each: ''Not Ready To Make Nice'' peaked at #13 and ''Everybody Knows'' at #11.<ref>[http://www.europeancma.com/charts.htm European CMA]</ref>

The group's [[Accidents & Accusations Tour]] began in July 2006. Ticket sales were strong in Canada and in some Northeastern markets, but notably weak in other areas. A number of shows were cancelled or relocated to smaller venues due to poor sales, and in [[Houston, Texas]], tickets never even went on sale when local radio stations refused to accept advertising for the event.<ref>

</ref> In August, a re-routed tour schedule was announced with a greater emphasis on Canadian dates, where ''Taking the Long Way'' had gone five-times-[[platinum record|platinum]]. The tour's shows themselves generally refrained from any explicit verbal political comments, letting the music, especially the central performance of ''Not Ready to Make Nice'', speak for itself. At a [[Nov. 5]], [[2006]] concert in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] the Chicks received a thunderous ovation when the song was over, and the band held up a handwritten sign from a fan that read "Nobody likes a nasty Bush."{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

During 2006, Dixie Chicks became the first major band to hire a designated blogger to be embedded with them for their promotional activities and tour. They partnered with Microsoft and hired [[Junichi Semitsu]], a Professor of Law at the [[University of San Diego]], to write first-hand accounts for their Accidents & Accusations Tour at the website http://dixiechicks.msn.com.<ref>

MSN broadcast an entire live concert, called "Scene of the Crime", of Dixie Chicks' return to Shepherds Bush, London, the site of "The Incident". Toward the end of the concert, Natalie said from the stage, "And all week, the only thing people keep asking is, 'What are you gonna say? Do you know what you're gonna say?'  As usual I didn't plan anything, but I thought I'd say something brand new and just say, 'Just so you know, we're ashamed the President of the United States is from Texas.' " which was met with thunderous applause and cheers.

In 2006, ''Taking the Long Way'' was the ninth best-selling album in the United States. It won the 2007 [[Grammy Award]] for Best Album, Best Record, and Best Song (for "[[Not Ready To Make Nice]]") - 14 years since one artist or group last swept those three awards<ref>http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00B1FF8345B0C708DDDAB0894DF404482</ref> - and Best Country Album on [[February 11]], [[2007]].
After their Grammy win, Dixie Chicks album ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'' hit #8 on [[Billboard 200]] and #1 on the country album charts and the Song of the Year-winning [[Not Ready to Make Nice]] re-entered the charts at #4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]].

The music video for "Not Ready to Make Nice" was nominated for the 2007 CMT Music Video Awards in the categories of "Video of the Year" and "Group Video of the Year," however, the video did not win in its nominated categories.<ref>[http://www.cmt.com/shows/events/cmt_music_awards/2007/nominees/ CMT Music Video Award Nominees]</ref>

Dixie Chicks were nominated for the 2007 [[Country Music Association]]'s award for Top Vocal Group, their first nomination from the CMA Awards since 2003.<ref>[http://www.cmaawards.com/2007/database/ArtistDetail.aspx?artistId=505 Awards Database: Artist Detail: Dixie Chicks]</ref> The trio lost to [[Rascal Flatts]].

==''Shut Up and Sing''==
An ad for ''[[Shut up and Sing]]'', a documentary about the furor over Maines's comment, was turned down by [[NBC]] on [[October 27]], [[2006]], citing a policy barring ads dealing with "public controversy". Ads for the documentary were rebuffed by the smaller [[The CW Television Network|CW]] network as well; local affiliate stations of all five major broadcasters, including NBC and CW, ran promotional spots for the film in New York and Los Angeles, the two cities where it opened that day. "It's a sad commentary about the level of fear in our society that a movie about a group of courageous entertainers who were blacklisted for exercising their right of free speech is now itself being blacklisted by corporate America," the film's distributor [[Harvey Weinstein]] said in a statement.<ref>http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/entertainment/2006-10/29/content_719231.htm</ref>
   
''Shut Up And Sing's'' title was taken from "Not Ready To Make Nice", which in turn took the phrase from a threatening letter received by the band.<ref>[http://www.hour.ca/film/film.aspx?iIDArticle=10688 "Shut Up And Sing", High Notes], Melora Koepke, Hour.ca, November 2, 2006, accessed April 7, 2007</ref>
