'''Larry Wayne "Chipper" Jones, Jr.''' (born April 24, 1972 in [[DeLand, Florida|DeLand]], [[Florida]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] [[baseball]] player. Although initially a [[shortstop]], Chipper has spent most of his career as the [[starting lineup#Baseball starting lineup|starting]] [[third baseman]] for the [[Atlanta Braves]]. In {{by|2002}} and {{by|2003}}, Jones primarily played [[left fielder|left field]] before returning to third base in 2004.

Jones debuted in {{by|1993}} and has played his entire career with the [[Atlanta Braves]]. Chipper won the {{by|1999}} [[National League]] [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]], as well as the 1999 and {{by|2000}} National League [[List of NL Silver Slugger Winners at Third Base|Silver Slugger Award]] for third basemen. He currently holds the Braves team record for career [[On base percentage]] (.406), and on May 31, 2006, he passed [[Hank Aaron]] for second place on the Atlanta Braves all-time career [[home run]] list.<ref>While Aaron hit 755 home runs during his career, 733 of them for the Braves, he only hit 365 during the time when the Braves were based in the city of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Aaron hit the rest of his home runs while the Braves were located in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], and after he left the Braves for the [[Milwaukee Brewers]].</ref>  On July 5, 2007, he passed [[Dale Murphy]] for the Atlanta club record of 372 home runs.

In his career, through the 2008 season, Jones is a .310/.408/.548 hitter with 408 [[home run]]s, 1,243 [[Base on balls|walk]]s and 1,374 [[Run batted in|RBI]] in 2,023 games. He is behind only [[Mickey Mantle]] and [[Eddie Murray]] on the all-time [[switch hitter]]s career home run list. He is considered one of the game's best all-around hitters, and one of the best switch hitters in the history of the game.<ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/blog/pikecracker/79624 Sporting News - Your expert source for MLB Baseball, NFL Football, NBA Basketball, NHL Hockey, NCAA Football, NCAA Basketball and Fantasy Sports scores, blogs, and articles<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_4_59/ai_64150730 Chipper Jones Moves Up Among Major Leagues' Best Switch-Hitters | Baseball Digest | Find Articles at BNET.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  He is the only switch hitter in Major League Baseball history to have a .300+ career (.310 at the end of the 2008 season) [[batting average]] and 400 home runs.

==Baseball career==
===High school and minor leagues===
After he completed his [[high school]] career at the [[Bolles School]] in [[Jacksonville]], Florida, Jones was selected by the Atlanta Braves with the [[List of MLB first overall draft choices|1st pick overall]] in the [[1990 Major League Baseball Draft|1990 amateur draft]].<ref>[http://www.chipperjones.com/about.htm About Chipper Jones, An Introduction to my Life], chipperjones.com.</ref>  Jones was not the Braves original choice in the draft. General Manager Bobby Cox had been looking at [[Todd Van Poppel]], but Van Poppel said he would not sign if he was drafted by Atlanta. Scouting Director Paul Snyder wanted Jones anyway.{{Fact|date=September 2008}} Jones then played three years in the Braves [[Minor league baseball|Minor League system]] before making his major league debut.

===Early major league career (1993&ndash;98)===
Jones debuted on September 11, {{by|1993}}, as the youngest player in the league.
In 1994, Jones suffered an [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] tear in his left knee, after he had been expected to compete for the starting left field job after veteran [[Ron Gant]] broke his leg during an offseason dirt bike accident. As a result of the injury, he missed the entire 1994 season.<ref>{{cite web| title = Jones at imdb.com | url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1763562/bio | accessdate = 2007-05-31}}</ref>

In 1995, Jones led all major league [[rookie]]s in RBI (86), [[games played]] (145), [[games started]] (123), [[plate appearance]]s (602), [[at bat]]s (524), and [[Run (baseball)|runs scored]] (87). That year, he finished second in the [[Baseball Writers Association of America|Baseball Writers]]' [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] balloting behind [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] pitcher [[Hideo Nomo]].<ref>{{cite web| title = 1995 ROY Voting | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1995.shtml | accessdate = 2007-05-31}}</ref>  In addition to achieving a level of personal success, Jones participated in the [[1995 World Series]]. The Braves won the series in six games over the [[Cleveland Indians]].  He also participated in the [[1996 World Series]], in which the [[New York Yankees]] defeated the Braves in 6 games.

In {{by|1998}}, Jones came in 9th in the voting for NL MVP<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1998.shtml#NLmvp Baseball Awards Voting for 1998 - Baseball-Reference.com]</ref>, as he scored 123 runs and had 96 walks (both 4th best in the league).

===MVP season (1999)===
In 1999, Jones won the [[National League]] [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] award after becoming the first player to ever hit over .300 (.319) while slugging 40 or more home runs (45; 3rd in the NL) and [[Double (baseball)|doubles]] (41), drawing 100 or more walks (126; 3rd in the league), notching 100 or more RBI (110) and Runs scored (116), and stealing 20 or more bases (25).{{Fact|date=September 2008}} He was also walked intentionally 18 times; 2nd in the league, and his .633 [[slugging percentage]] was 4th best in the NL. Jones led the Braves to the [[1999 World Series|World Series]] against the [[New York Yankees]] that year, in which the Braves were swept. He did, however, hit their only home run in the series, against Yankees' starter [[Orlando Hern<U+00E1>ndez]].<ref>[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/yr1999ws.shtml Baseball Almanac page on 1999 World Series], Note home run mentioned in text and Composite Hitting Statistics table </ref>

===2000&ndash;05===
Jones signed a six-year, $90 million deal in {{by|2000}}<ref>[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=387223 Chipper Jones@Everything2.com]</ref>. Jones batted .330 in {{by|2001}}, 5th best in the league, and led the league with a .349 road batting average. On his birthday, he hit two home runs.[http://www.sabr.org/sabr.cfm?a=cms,c,869,34,0] On defense, however, his [[range factor]] of 2.14 placed him last among the regular major league third basemen who qualified for the fielding ranking.[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlbhist/stats/fielding?groupId=9&season=2001&seasonType=2&split=81&sortOrder=true&sortColumn=rangeFactor] 

In 2001, a season of flux for the Braves who had won consecutive division titles since their [[1995 World Series]] victory without winning again, Jones was involved in a public "lingering feud" with former teammate [[John Rocker]]. Rocker referred to Jones on the radio by saying "Chip's white trash" and "as two-faced as they came." By late June the two claimed the feud had been put to bed. [http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/06/28/jones-rocker010628.html]

Before the start of the 2002 season, Jones announced his willingness to move from [[third base]] to left field, to make room for the incoming [[Vinny Castilla]]. Jones proved adequate in left field, but following two more early playoff exits in 2002 and 2003, a [[hamstring]] pull in the early {{by|2004}} season and (then) 3rd baseman [[Mark DeRosa]]'s struggles, he moved back to his regular position of third base.

In 2002, he batted .327, again 5th best in the NL. Jones was 3rd in the league with a .435 [[on base percentage]]. On August 16, 2004, he hit the 300th home run of his career in a 5-4 victory over the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. Following the {{by|2005}} season, Jones reworked his contract with the Braves -- freeing up money for the Braves to pursue elite [[free agent]]s, while virtually assuring he will end his career in Atlanta. The revamped deal gave the Braves $15 million over the course of the next three years, as well as $6 million to use in 2006. The new deal also converted two final team option years to guaranteed contracts.

===2006 World Baseball Classic===
Jones was selected to play in the inaugural 2006 [[World Baseball Classic]] (along with Braves teammate [[Jeff Francoeur]]). He hit a home run in his first at bat of the Classic against Mexico off of former Atlanta Braves teammate [[Oscar Villarreal]], who was with the team from 2006-2007. Chipper went 6-17 with a double and two homers in the tournament. 

===2006===
The 2006 season was one of numerous milestones for Jones. On [[June 10]], he became the Atlanta Braves' all-time RBI leader when he drove in his 1,144th run against the [[Houston Astros]] at [[Minute Maid Park]], passing former outfielder [[Dale Murphy]] and placing Jones third on the franchise's all-time list (including Braves teams based in Boston and Milwaukee), behind Hank Aaron (2,202) and [[Eddie Mathews]] (1,388). 

On [[July 15]] [[2006]], Jones recorded his 1,902nd career hit, to become the [[Atlanta Braves]]' all-time hits leader, passing Hank Aaron. The next day he hit a home run to extend his [[extra-base hit]]ting streak to 14 games, matching the Major League record set by [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pittsburgh]]'s [[Paul Waner]] in {{by|1927}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Chipper_Jones_1972&page=chronology |title=Chipper Jones from the Chronology |accessdate=2008-12-03 |work=BaseballLibrary.com}}</ref> A month later, on [[August 14]], Jones had his first career three-home run game. Jones homered in his final three at bats in the Braves' 10-4 win over the [[Washington Nationals]], finishing the night 4-for-5 with 5 RBI. 

Despite successes at the plate, injuries dogged Jones throughout the season and for the first time in his career, the Braves failed to qualify for postseason play.

===2007===
2007 was another year of impressive feats by Jones. On [[June 17]], he hit a [[Single (baseball)|single]] in the second inning against the [[Cleveland Indians]] for his 2,000th career hit. On [[July 5]], Jones tied and passed Braves legend Dale Murphy for first on the all-time Atlanta Braves home run list when he belted his 371st and 372nd home runs against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] at [[Dodger Stadium]].<ref name="LAD_2007_07_05">[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=270705119 Atlanta Braves at Los Angeles Dodgers game recap], AP, [[July 5]], [[2007]].</ref>  This game was also the first time he hit homers from both sides of the plate since 2000.<ref name="LAD_2007_07_05" />  The next day, he had his 400th career double in the ninth inning against [[San Diego Padres]] pitcher [[Kevin Cameron (baseball)|Kevin Cameron]], who had previously only allowed one extra-base hit all year. On [[July 29]], Jones matched a career-high with 5 RBIs as the Braves shut out the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] 14-0. He accomplished the feat again on [[August 23]] against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. In the fifth inning of an [[August 9]] game at [[Shea Stadium]], Jones hit a towering three-run homer to right field off Mets starter [[John Maine]]. It would later be measured at 470 feet.

Jones finished the season 2nd in NL batting average (.337), 3rd in NL OBP (.425), 3rd in NL SLG (.604), and 1st in NL OPS (1.029). He was also sixth in MVP voting, his highest finish since winning the award in 1999.

While the Braves enjoyed some early successes, injuries to the pitching staff spoiled the ample contributions from Atlanta's potent offense. While the Braves posted a winning record, they finished third in the National League East, and sat out the postseason.

He opened the Chipper Jones' 10th Inning Baseball Academy in [[Suwanee, Georgia]] in late 2007.

===2008===
[[Image:Chipper Jones2.jpg|thumb|right|Jones swings at a pitch.]]
Jones began the 2008 season where he left off in 2007, hitting over .400 in April while slugging 7 home runs. He also had back-to-back games in which he hit two home runs. Despite these accomplishments, he ultimately lost the NL Player of the Month award in April to [[Chase Utley]]. On June 13, Jones was hitting .414 with 15 home runs, but his average dropped to .393 by June 22.

He hit his 400th home run on June 5 off [[Ricky Nolasco]] of the Florida Marlins, and he was named NL Player of the Week for the week of June 2nd - 8th. He was picked to start in the All-Star game, receiving the most votes by fans, managers, and other players of any NL third basemen. Jones won his first batting title at age 36, the oldest switch-hitter ever to win a batting title. Jones hit .364 during 2008, one point off the all-time switch-hitter high for a season of .365, set by [[Mickey Mantle]].
 
===2009===
In December 2008, Jones accepted an invitation to play for the USA team in the [[2009 World Baseball Classic]]. He will play alongside teammate [[Brian McCann]].  Jones was scratched from an elimination game in the [[2009 World Baseball Classic]] after straining his right oblique muscle, while playing for team [[USA]]. The announcement came an hour before the game was to be played against team [[Netherlands]].  As reported by the [[CBC]] on March 13, 2009, Chipper criticized [[Toronto]] and the play schedule of the [[World Baseball Classic]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2009/03/18/sp-jones-wbc.html|publisher=[[CBC]]|date=2009-03-18|last=Canadian|first=Press |accessdate = 2009-04-04 |title=Chipper Jones blasts Toronto, WBC.}}</ref>

On March 31, 2009 Jones agreed to a three-year $42 million contract extension with the Braves; the deal includes an option that could become worth up to $61 million over four seasons.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Associated Press]]|date=2009-03-31|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/baseball/mlb/03/31/jones.braves.ap/index.html|title=Jones, Braves Agree to Extension|accessdate=2009-04-01|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated|SI.com]]}}</ref>

==Personal life==
The nickname "Chipper" came from family members who felt he was a "chip-off-the-old-block" of his father. 

Chipper met his first wife, Karin Fulford while he was playing with the Braves class A affiliate in [[Macon, Georgia]]. The couple divorced after it was revealed that Jones had had an 18-month affair with a [[Hooters]] waitress which produced a son out of wedlock, Matthew, born in 1997.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chipperjones.com/news0320051.html|publisher=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=2005-03-04|last=Maese|first=Rick|accessdate = 2007-04-24|title=Feeling just Chipper: Despite his youthful persona, the popular Braves star acknowledges his advancing years.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='I've messed up royally': Braves' Jones admits fathering out-of-wedlock child|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/1998/10/22/jones_paternity/|date=1998-10-22|publisher=[[CNNSI.com]]|author=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate = 2007-04-24}}</ref> He married Sharon Logonov in March 2000 in Pierson, FL. They have three sons: Larry Wayne III (Trey), Tristen, and Shea (named after Shea Stadium).

==Philanthropy==
In 2008, Chipper Jones released a charity wine called "Chipper Chardonnay" with 100% of his proceeds supporting the Miracle League, an organization serving children with disabilities.
