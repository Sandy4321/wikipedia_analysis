'''Islais Creek''' or '''Islais Creek Channel''' (previously known as '''Du Vrees Creek''', '''Islais Channel''' and '''Islais Swamp''')<ref>According to the [http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:3:7699013154050427750::NO::P3_FID:254827 Geographic Names Information System by USGS], other lesser known variant names for Islais Creek or Islais Creek Channel include Arroyo Islais, El Arroyo De Los Yslais, Islar Creek, and Du Urees Creek.</ref> is a small creek in [[San Francisco, California]]. The current name of the creek is said to be derived from a [[Salinan]] [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American]] word "''slay''" or "''islay''," the name for the ''[[Prunus ilicifolia]]'' wild cherries. 

Originally the residing place for the Ohlone Indian until the 1700s, the  area surrounding the Islais Creek has become a major industrial hub since the Gold Rush. As more and more industries began to settle near the creek bank, the condition of the creek worsened. After the devastated earthquake in 1906, the city decided to [[land reclamation|reclaim]] the creek using earthquake debris, reducing the waterbody to its present size. Though much of Islais Creek has been converted to an underground [[culvert]], remnants still exist today at both Glen Canyon Park and Third Street. Several community organizations are dedicated to preserve these remnants, as they are important wildlife habitats.

It then coursed through Glen Canyon and through what is now Bosworth Street until it reached the bottom of the [[Mission Street]] viaduct at [[I-280]]. The other branch began at the Cayuga Avenue and Regent Street intersection. The creek flowed from the intersection down to the Mission Street viaduct where the two branches joined. Together, as a much wider body of water, it passed through Geneva Avenue and [[Alemany Boulevard]], before empting into the Islais Creek estuary, near today's Industrial Street, in the San Francisco Bay.<ref name="sfmuseum">{{cite web | author=William C.

==History==
[[Image:T Third Islais.jpg|thumb|right|A T-Third Street train crossing the Islais Creek]]
The history of Islais Creek can be traced back to the 1700s, where large numbers of [[Ohlone]] Indians resided along the creek.<ref name="sfwater"/> The creek first appeared on [[Mexican]] maps in 1834, named for the ''Los Islais''<ref name="sfgate">{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1996/11/30/MN50463.DTL&hw=Islais+Creek&sn=001&sc=1000 |title=New Current for Historic S.F. Waterway |accessdate=2007-11-02 |work= |publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle'' |date=1996-11-30 |author=Carl Nolte }}</ref> or the ''Islay'' cherries. Later in 1850, water from the creek was used to irrigate crops in the city.<ref name="NPC"/> The [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] marked the decline of the creek as large numbers of gold rushers swarmed into the city.<ref name="NPC"/> In 1871, the area surrounding the creek became known as the city<U+2019>s "New Butchertown" as more than 100 slaughterhouses operated along the creek. Since then, the condition of the creek deteriorated, literally becoming a dumping place of garbage, sewage, [[animal waste]], and unsold meat products. The condition became so bad that the creek was commonly referred to as "[[Shit]] Creek" by San Franciscans, according to historian Karl Kortum.<ref name="sfgate"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.noevalleyvoice.com/2006/April/Byli.html |title=Islais Creek: From Stream to Sewer |accessdate=2008-08-20 |work= |publisher=''The Noe Valley Voice'' |date=April, 2006 |author=Kevin Cutler }}</ref> 

After the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]], [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] voted to fill up the creek with earthquake debris, reducing the creek to its present size.<ref name="sfwater"/> During [[World War II]], it served as parking areas for large ocean-going tugs. The creek also located the largest [[copra| copra coconut]] processing plant in the entire [[United States]] [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].<ref name="Islais1"/> In fact, the abandoned five-story high copra crane, used to transport large amount of copras from ships to the plant as late as 1974, still remains on the creek bank today and is preserved as a historic landmark.<ref name="NPC"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bluegreenway.org/alexander_birdseye.html |title=A bird<U+2019>s eye view of The Blue Greenway: Islais Creek |accessdate=2008-08-20 |work= |publisher=Neighborhood Parks Council |date= |author=Jeanne Alexander }}</ref> In the 1950s, Islais Creek was home to the largest [[sardine]] [[canning]] industry in the world. The deteriorated condition of the creek gradually improved after a water treatment plant was constructed in 1970.<ref name="NPC"/> Today, the majority of the creek is covered and transformed into a culvert with its remnants flowing at Glen Canyon and near the bay.

Many local community organizations were set up to improve the condition of the creek and nearby areas. Friends of Islais Creek, established back in 1984, and David Erickson, a local community figure, were committed to build a waterfront park in Islais Creek. The initial plan for a park was finally launched in 1988 with a $50,000 grant from the State Department of Water Resources as well as community groups in [[Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco, California|The Bayview]]. With an additional of $100,000 federal and local grants as well as supports from non-profit organizations and governmental agencies, namely the [[Sierra Club]], [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]] (Muni), Department of Public Works, [[San Francisco Public Utilities Commission|Public Utilities Commission]], [[Port of San Francisco]], and [[Caltrans]], the park was finished in 1998.<ref name="NPC"/><ref name="sewage">{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/07/28/MN283123.DTL |title=Urban oasis garden in legal limbo in S.F. |accessdate=2007-11-02 |work= |publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle'' |date=2003-07-28 |author=Joe Garofoli}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/06/28/SP140784.DTL |title=Ultimate dream: a bay water trail |accessdate=2007-11-02 |work= |publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle'' |date=2001-06-28 |author=Paul McHugh }}</ref> Located adjacent to Pier 80 on the shores of the creek, the Muwekma Ohlone Park or the Muwekma Ohlone Sanctuary is named after the native inhabitants and has since became an important habitat for a wide array of wildlife, including the [[Pacific Chorus Frog]] and [[Mission blue butterfly]].<ref name="arteco"/><ref name="sfwater"/>

On [[November 19]] [[2001]], construction crews, while preparing to drill an [[electrical conduit]] (consisting of six large 115kV electrical cables) across the creek for the [[Muni Metro]] [[T Third Street]] light rail line, cracked the concrete [[Sanitary sewer|sewer]] underground which carries more than 80 million gallons of sewage a day. The incident flooded the creek and its adjacent Muwekma Ohlone Park with sewage. The park had to be excavated to make way for the repairing of the sewer pipe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2004/07/29/16905921.php |title=Muni destroys park, dumps sewage, wastes millions crossing Islais Creek |accessdate=2008-08-21 |work= |publisher=''Indybay'' |date=2004-07-29 |author=Maurice B.

===Health hazard===
Since Islais Creek is a culvert that carries storm water, domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater combined, it is possible for the sewage to overflow. Such overflow can cause a public health hazard as Islais Creek displays higher level of [[heavy metals]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]], [[bacteria]], as well as [[chlorine|organochlorines]] than other parts of the San Francisco Bay.<ref name="health">{{cite web |url=http://www.sfpower.org/newswire/water2.php |title=Storm Runoffs May Pose Health, Environmental Risks |accessdate=2008-08-21 |work= |publisher=Neighborhood Newswire |date=2005-03-26 |author=Randall Frost }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last =Kennish | first =Michael | title =Ecology of Estuaries: Anthropogenic Effects | publisher =CRC Press | date =1991-11-19 | pages =512 | accessdate=2008-08-24 | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=LR9OJ2SrZ64C&pg=PA237&lpg=PA237&dq=islais+creek&source=web&ots=OSJmeRkw5L&sig=fkOMODRY5HLL8MT4nEocDnrFF5s#PPA237,M1

The Third Street Bridge is currently the only major crossing of the creek, carrying T Third Street light rail line and Third Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/01/06/BAGTRNDU001.DTL |title=3rd Street light rail nearly at finish line |accessdate=2007-11-03 |work= |publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle'' |date=2007-01-06 |author=Michael Cabanatuan }}</ref> The Port of San Francisco had also planned to extend Illnois Street across Islais Creek back in 2002 to relieve traffic for Third Street.
