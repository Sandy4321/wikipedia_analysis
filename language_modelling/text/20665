'''Chemical Bank''' was a bank with headquarters  in [[New York City]] from 1823 until 1996.  The bank operated as the primary subsidiary of the '''Chemical Banking Corporation''', a [[bank holding company]] established in 1988.  At the end of 1995, Chemical was the third largest bank in the U.S. with approximately $182.9 billion in assets.<ref name=Chemical10k1995>[http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/0000950123-96-001197.txt Chemical Banking Corp. SEC Form 10-K Annual Report for the Year Ended December 31, 1995]</ref> 

Beginning in 1920 but accelerating in the 1980s and 1990s, Chemical was a leading consolidator of the banking industry in the United States, acquiring [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], [[Manufacturers Hanover]], [[Texas Commerce Bank]] and [[Corn Exchange Bank]] among others.  Following Chemical's acquisition of Chase, the bank adopted the venerable [[Chase (bank)|Chase]] brand.  What had been Chemical Bank, is at the core of what today is [[JPMorgan Chase]].

Chemical Bank was headquartered in [[New York City]] with more than 39,000 employees globally as of the end of 1995.

==Overview of the company==
[[File:277park.jpg|thumb|155px|Chemical's offices at [[277 Park Avenue]] from 1979 until its 1991 merger with [[Manufacturers Hanover Corporation]], when the bank moved across the street]]

Chemical Bank was the principal operating subsidiary of the Chemical Banking Corporation, a [[bank holding company]].  As of the end of 1995, prior to its merger with the [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], Chemical was the third largest bank in the United States in terms of total assets with $182.9 billion of assets.  The Chemical Banking Corporation was the fifth largest bank holding company in terms of total assets.<ref name=Chemical10k1995 />  

Of Chemical's $182.9 billion of total assets, the bank held approximately $82.1 billion of loans, representing a balance between mortgage loans and other consumer loans as well as commercial loans in the U.S. and internationally.  Among Chemical's largest international exposure was to Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom. The other asset's on the bank's balances sheet included cash as well as various [[debt (finance)|debt]] and [[equity (finance)|equity]] securities.<ref name=Chemical10k1995 />

Chemical reported record net income of $1.8 billion for 1995.  Chemical's level of capital at the end of 1995 remained strong, with [[capital adequacy ratio]]s well in excess of regulatory requirements. The Corporation's [[Tier 1 capital|Tier 1]] and [[Tier 2 capital|Total Capital]] ratios were 8.5% and 12.1%, respectively.<ref name=Chemical10k1995 />

Chemical was one of the leading banks in the U.S., active both in [[corporate banking]] as well as [[retail banking]].  Within retail banking, Chemical provided personal and commercial [[checking accounts]], [[savings account|savings]] and [[Time deposit|time deposit account]]s, personal loans, consumer financing and mortgage banking as well as trust and estate administration.<ref name=Chemical10k1995 />  

Chemical's corporate banking business provided a wide variety business loans, leasing, real estate financing, money transfer and cash management among other services.<ref name=Chemical10k1995 />  Chemical was among the leading bank lenders to small and medium sized businesses.  Chemical also had a significant presence in [[investment banking]] as well as underwriting [[corporate debt]] and [[equity (finance)|equity securities]].<ref name=Chemical10k1995 />

===Lines of business===
Prior to its merger with Chase, Chemical was structured into two operating segments: the Global Bank and Consumer & Relationship Banking.  
* ''Global Bank'' The Global Bank serviced the bank's large corporate clients was made up of a traditional [[investment banking]] division, known as Global Banking & Investment Banking as well as a [[Market maker|sales and trading]] division, known as Global Markets.  Global Banking & Investment Banking performed advisory services such as [[mergers and acquisitions]] and [[corporate restructuring|restructuring]] as well as capital raising functions, such as [[leveraged finance|leveraged loan syndication]], [[high yield debt|high yield financings]] and other [[debt (finance)|debt]] and [[equity (finance)|equity underwritings]].  The bank's [[private equity]] and [[venture capital]] functions were also housed in this division.  Global Markets was primarily focused on sales and trading activities, [[foreign exchange|foreign exchange dealing]]; [[financial derivative|derivatives trading and structuring]], [[risk management]] and other market related functions.  In 1995, Chemicals Global Bank revenue was roughly balanced between investment banking and markets activities <ref name=Chemical10k1995 />

* ''Consumer & Relationship Banking''.  Consumer and Relationship Banking was made up of a number of businesses including [[consumer banking]], [[commercial banking]]; [[credit card]]s; [[Mortgage loan|mortgage banking]] (and other [[consumer finance]], i.e. - [[home equity loan]]s, [[student loan]]s) as well as a number of smaller businesses. Chemical maintained a leading market share position in providing financial services to middle market companies nationally and small businesses in the [[New York metropolitan area]].  This division also included a small [[private banking]] business, although Chemical was not a leading player in this market.<ref name=Chemical10k1995 />

===Offices===
The bank opened its first offices at 216 Broadway in [[Downtown New York]] in 1824 at the corner of [[Ann Street (Manhattan)|Ann Street]].  In 1848 the bank agreed to sell its building to its neighbor [[Barnum's American Museum]] (the building collapsed during Barnum's subsequent remodeling) and in 1850 the bank moved into its newly constructed headquarters at [[270 Broadway]].<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F60E14FF3F5B167A93C3AB1782D85F4C8285F9 Plan $2,500,000 Building at Broadway and Chambers - New York Times - September 21, 1928]</ref>  Chemical bought additional land adjacent its 270 Broadway building in 1879 and 1887 but its offices remained modest through the turn of the century.  

In 1907 the bank constructed a new headquarters on the original and adjacent properties at 270 Broadway.  In 1921, Chemical acquired a 13-Story building belonging to the Shoe & Leather Bank on Broadway, next door to and surrounded by its existing properties.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F0CEEDF123CE533A2575AC2A9679C946095D6CF Chemical Buys Broadway Corner]. New York Times, January 29, 1921</ref>  Despite expanding its 1907 headquarters over the years, by the mid-1920s Chemical was in need of additional space to accommodate its growth and reflect its increasing profile.  

In 1926, the bank made plans to move again, this time constructing a new six story location at 165 Broadway, on the corner of [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]] and [[Cortlandt Street]], closer to the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].  Chemical moved into its new headquarters in 1928, after completion of the building, and the bank's headquarters would remain at that location for more than five decades.<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50713FE3E581B7A93C0AB1789D95F428285F9 "Chemical National's Move"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 22, 1926.

==History==
===Founding and early history===
[[File:Certificate of Stock of Chemical Mfg Company 1824.png|thumb|200px|right|Certificate of Stock of the Chemical Manufacturing Company, ca. 1824]]
The company was founded in 1823 as the New York Chemical Manufacturing Company by [[Balthazar P. Melick]] together with the original directors of the company, John C. Morrison, Mark Spenser, Gerardus Post, James Jenkins, William A. Seely and William Stebbins.<ref name=chemical1913hist>[http://books.google.com/books?id=1XkaAAAAMAAJ History of the Chemical Bank 1823-1913].  Privately Published by The Chemical National Bank, 1913</ref>  Additionally, [[Joseph Sampson]], although not a director was among the largest of the original shareholders of the bank.<ref name=chemical1913hist />  The founders used the manufacturing company, which produced [[chemical]]s such as [[blue vitriol]], [[alum]], [[nitric acid]], [[camphor]] and [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]], as well as medicines, paints, and [[dye]]s as a means to securing a [[State bank|bank charter]] from the New York State legislature.<ref>[http://www.scripophily.net/chemnatbanof.html scripophily.net - Retrieved November 8, 2007]</ref>  During the 1820s, prospective bankers found that they were more likely to be able to successfully secure a charter if the bank were part of a larger business.  The following year, in April 1824, the company successfully amended its charter to allow Chemical to begin its banking practice.  As a result, Chemical Bank was originally a division of the New York Chemical Manufacturing Company.  Balthazar Melick was named the first president of the bank, which catered to merchants in New York City.<ref name=bankermag1917>[http://books.google.com/books?id=MVsmAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA665 Chemical National Bank of New York to Pay Interest on Deposits].

[[File:Balthazar Melick founder of Chemical Bank.png|thumb|140px|left|Balthazar P. "Baltus" Melick, founder and first president of Chemical Bank (1823-1831)]]

[[John Mason (businessman)|John Mason]] became a shareholder of the bank in 1826 and would serve as Chemical's second president.  Mason, who would later be referred to as "the father of the Chemical Bank," and was one of the richest merchants of his day in New York, succeeded Baltus Melick in 1831.<ref name=chemical1913hist />  Mason was responsible for establishing the highly conservative business culture of the young bank that would persist for nearly 90 years.  For its first twenty-five years, the bank paid no dividends, nor did it pay interest on its customers deposits.<ref name=bankermag1917 />  Mason was also responsible for leading Chemical through the [[Panic of 1837]].  When a speculative bubble collapsed on May 10, 1837, banks suspended payment of gold and silver.  Although twenty years later, Chemical would stand alone and continue to make payments in [[specie]], in this crisis the bank followed others in suspending payments.  Chemical was one of the earliest to resume payments in specie.<ref name=chemical1913hist />  

[[File:John Mason President of Chemical Bank c.1830s.png|thumb|130px|right|[[John Mason (businessman)|John Mason]], early shareholder and second president of Chemical Bank (1831-1839)]]

Mason died on September 26, 1839, but his legacy of conservatism was taken on by his successors.<ref name=bankermag1917 />  Isaac Jones and later his cousin John Quentin Jones would lead Chemical, both serving as president, across the next forty years through 1878.  Both Isaac and John Jones had close connections to [[John Mason (businessman)|John Mason]], particularly Isaac who married one of [[John Mason (businessman)|John Mason]]'s three daughters.  The Mason and Jones families would maintain effective control of Chemical for much of its first five decades.<ref name=aroundwashsq>[http://books.google.com/books?id=K8aMN50YOvkC&pg=PA41 Around Washington Square: an illustrated history of Greenwich Village]. JHU Press, 2003</ref>  John Q. Jones was succeeded in 1878 by George G.

Williams would serve as president from 1878 through 1903.<ref name=chemical1913hist />

In 1844, when New York Chemical Manufacturing Company's original charter expired, the chemical company was liquidated and was reincorporated as a bank only, becoming the Chemical Bank of New York in 1844.<ref name=bankermag1917 />  Among the bank's first directors under its new charter were [[Cornelius Roosevelt]], John D. Wolfe, Isaac Platt and Bradish Johnson, as well as the bank's president John Q. Jones.<ref name=chemical1913hist />  The company sold all remaining inventories from the chemical division as well as real estate holdings by 1851.  

[[File:Chemical bank Note 1835.png|thumb|200px|left|Chemical Bank $5 note, ca. 1835]]

Two years later, in 1853, Chemical became a charter member of the [[New York Clearing House]], the first and largest bank clearing house in the U.S.<ref name=bankermag1917 />  Two Chemical presidents would also serve as head of the clearing house, with John Q. Jones serving from 1865-1871 and George G. Williams serving in 1886 and from 1893-1894.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=i8kJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA47 Clearing house of New York city: New York clearing house association, 1854-1905].  1904</ref>

During the [[Panic of 1857]], Chemical Bank earned the nickname "Old Bullion" by taking a stand that it would continue to redeem its bank notes in [[specie]] throughout the crisis.  The panic, which had hit banks and caused a number of failures, led banks across the country to suspend specie payments and turn to issuing paper promissory notes.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,748374,00.html Business & Finance: Old Bullion's Team].

New York Times, July 30, 1924</ref>  Chemical's decision was highly unpopular among its fellow banks and led to the bank's temporary suspension from the [[New York Clearing House]], of which Chemical was a charter member.<ref>[[Jerry Markham|Markham, Jerry]].

Volume I: From Christopher Columbus through the Robber Barrons. 2002</ref>  While hundreds of banks closed, including 18 banks in New York in a single day, Chemical developed a reputation for stability.  This reputation proved extremely important in Chemical's growth during subsequent recessions during the 1860s.  Chemical frequently used the refrain "Good as gold then, good as gold today" in advertisements from the 1860s well into the 20th century.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=QWkJMNUynzsC&pg=RA2-PA117 Reaching the Man who Reads as he Runs].  Printers' ink, A Journal for Advertisers, Vol CXIX No. 1, April 6, 1922</ref> 

Chemical received its [[national charter]] as the Chemical National Bank of New York in 1865, at the urging of the secretary of the treasury.  This allowed Chemical to issue government-backed national bank notes, the forerunner to paper money. By the early 1870s, Chemical had accumulated deposits in excess of $6 million.

A contemporary perspective of Chemical from 1893 described the bank as follows:  
{{cquote|"The Chemical National Bank is a famous corporation. Its stock commands a greater price in proportion to its par value than any other bank stock. It has the greatest surplus and undivided profits, with a single exception, of any bank in the country.  It has the largest amount of individual deposits. It pays the largest percentage of dividends on its par value of any corporation of any kind ... The shares of the bank based on $100 par value have sold as high as $4,980 each..."<ref>King, Moses.

===1900-1946===

By the first decade of the 20th century, Chemical had one of the strongest reputations in banking but as a business was in decline, losing accounts each year.  Unlike many of its peers, Chemical had been reluctant to expand into securities and other businesses and had not paid interest on bank accounts.  Both practices, considered to be highly conservative, had allowed Chemical to develop a large capital reserve but were not attracting customers.  [[William H. Porter]], a prominent banker of the era, was named president of the bank in 1903 after the death of the previous president George G. Williams.<ref name=mrwilliams />  Porter would leave Chemical seven years later to become a partner at [[J.P. Morgan & Co.]] in 1910 and was succeeded by Joseph B. Martindale, who was named president in 1911.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=5TEPAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA62 The Chemical National Bank].  The Independent, Volume 70, p.62.</ref>

In 1917, Chemical named a new president of the bank, Herbert Twitchell,<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9503E5DA133AE433A25754C1A9619C946696D6CF To Head Chemical Bank.; Herbert K.

New York Times, September 12, 1917</ref>  

Twitchell initiated a major turnaround of Chemical, setting up a trust business and reversing Chemical's policy of not paying interest on cash accounts.   These steps along with other initiatives, resulted in an increase in deposits from $35 million to $81 million by 1920.<ref name=chemcitizens /><ref name=bankermag1917 />  In 1920, Twitchell was succeeded by Percy H.

In 1920, Chemical completed its first major acquisition, merging with Citizens National Bank.  The acquisition of Citizens National, a small New York commercial bank, increased Chemical's assets to more than $200 million with  more than $140 million of deposits.<ref name=chemcitizens>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=950DE4DE173AEE32A2575AC1A9659C946195D6CF Chemical Bank to Absorb Citizens].  New York Times, March 19, 1920</ref>  In 1923 Chemical established its first branch and by the end of the 1920s had opened a dozen branches in Manhattan and Brooklyn as well as a branch in London, its first international presence.

In 1929, Chemical reincorporated as a state bank in New York as Chemical Bank & Trust Company and merged with the United States Mortgage & Trust Company, headquartered on the [[Madison Avenue]] and [[74th Street (Manhattan)|74th Street]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/realestate/25scapes.html Depression-Era Alternatives to the Mattress Stash].

In 1947, after the retirement of Percy Johnston, Harold H. Helm was named the new president of Chemical and would serve first as president and later as chairman of the bank for the next 18 years until his retirement in 1965.  Under Helm, Chemical completed a series of large mergers in the late 1940s and early 1950s that again made the bank among the largest in the U.S.<ref name=helm />  In 1947, Chemical merged with Continental Bank and Trust Company.  Then in 1954, Chemical would merge with the [[Corn Exchange Bank]] and only five years later merge again with the New York Trust Company.  

Chemical completed its largest acquisition to that point, in 1954, merging with the [[Corn Exchange Bank]] to become the '''Chemical Corn Exchange Bank'''.  Founded in 1853, the Corn Exchange Bank was based in [[New York City]], but had built a network of branches in other states through the acquisition of community banks.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/realestate/streetscape-corn-exchange-bank-noble-monument-thrift-with-unusually-modern-air.html The Corn Exchange Bank; A 'Noble Monument to Thrift' With an Unusually Modern Air].

In 1959, the bank, now known as Chemical Corn Exchange Bank, merged with New York Trust Company, effectively doubling the size of the company.

In these years, Chemical opened new offices in the [[Frankfurt, Germany]] (1969), [[Zurich, Switzerland]] (1971), [[Brussels, Belgium]] (1971), [[Paris, France]]  (1971) and [[Tokyo, Japan]] (1972).

Chemical continued pursuing acquisitions, throughout the 1980s notably its acquisitions of [[Texas Commerce Bank]] (1986) and [[Horizon Bancorp]] (1986) as well as its attempted takeover of [[Florida National Bank]] (1982).  

Chemical and [[Florida National Bank]] agreed, in 1982, to enter into a merger, after laws preventing interstate banking were lifted, giving Chemical an option to acquire the business.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E2D71238F933A15756C0A964948260 Florida Bank's Special Meeting].

[[Image:Texas Commerce Bancshares Logo.png|210px|thumb|right|[[Texas Commerce Bank]], acquired by Chemical in 1986 in the largest interstate banking merger at that time]]

Chemical completed its largest transaction of the 1980s in December 1986, when the bank agreed to acquire [[Texas Commerce Bank]].  The $1.1 billion transaction represented the largest interstate banking merger in U.S. history to that time.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/16/business/chemical-is-buying-a-big-texas-bank.html Chemical is Buying a Big Texas Bank].

New York Times, March 31, 1988</ref>  Texas Commerce, which was officially acquired in May 1987, was one of the largest bank holding companies in the Southwestern U.S., with a strong presence in corporate banking for small and medium sized businesses.  Chemical did not seek [[FDIC]] backing for its acquisition of Texas Commerce although other large Texas banks, [[First RepublicBank Corporation]] (Acquired by [[NationsBank]]) and [[MCorp Bank]] (acquired by [[Bank One]]), received over $5 billion of support.  Ultimately Chemical contributed $300 million to shore Texas Commerce as it continued to suffer losses.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/11/business/profile-marc-j-shapiro-this-banker-may-be-too-big-for-texas.html This Banker May Be Too Big for Texas].

Also in 1986, Chemical agreed to a merger with New Jersey-based [[Horizon Bancorp]], although the merger was not completed until 1989, due again to interstate banking rules.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/06/business/jersey-banks-await-mergers.html Jersey Banks Await Mergers].  New York Times, June 6, 1987</ref>  

The bank's holding company, which had been the Chemical New York Corporation was renamed the '''Chemical Banking Corporation''' in 1988 following its series of out of state mergers and acquisitions, including [[Texas Commerce Bank]] and [[Horizon Bancorp]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/17/business/company-news-chemical-s-name.html Chemical's Name].  Reuters, March 17, 1988</ref>  

It was during this period, in the 1980s and early 1990s, that Chemical emerged as one of the leaders in the financing of [[leveraged buyout]] transactions.  By the late 1980s, Chemical developed its reputation for financing buyouts, building a [[leveraged finance|syndicated leveraged finance]] business and related advisory businesses under the auspices of pioneering investment banker, [[James B. Lee, Jr.|Jimmy Lee]].<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1997/b3522103.arc.htm JIMMY LEE'S GLOBAL CHASE].

New York Times, August 11, 1995</ref>  It was not until 1993 that Chemical would permission to underwrite corporate bonds, however within a few years, Chemical (and later Chase) became a major underwriter of below-investment-grade debt under Lee.  Additionally, in 1984, Chemical launched [[Chemical Venture Partners]] to invest in [[private equity]] transactions alongside various [[financial sponsor]]s.<ref>[http://media.www.harbus.org/media/storage/paper343/news/2003/02/10/News/Interview.With.Jeff.Walker.Managing.Partner.Of.Jp.Morgan.Partners-365198.shtml Interview with Jeff Walker, Managing Partner of JP Morgan Partners].

===1990s===
[[File:Manufacturers Hanover logo.png|210px|thumb|right|[[Manufacturers Hanover]], acquired by Chemical in 1991 in the largest banking merger at that time]]
[[Image:Chase logo pre merger.png|thumb|right|210px|Logo used by the combined company after its merger with [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] in 1996]]
In July 1991, Chemical announced that it would acquire [[Manufacturers Hanover Corporation]] in a $135 billion merger transaction.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/16/business/the-bank-merger-manny-hanny-a-name-for-history-books.html  'Manny Hanny': A Name for History Books].  New York Times, July 16, 1991</ref>  At the time of the merger, Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover were the sixth and ninth largest banks, respectively, by assets.  The transaction, when it closed at the end of 1991, made the combined bank, which retained the Chemical name, the second largest bank in the U.S., behind [[Citicorp]] both in terms of assets and customers (approximately 1.2 million household accounts in 1991).<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/16/business/the-bank-merger-big-bank-merger-to-join-chemical-manufacturers.html The Bank Merger; Big Bank Merger To Join Chemical, Manufacturers].  New York Times, July 16, 1991</ref>  Chemical adopted Manufacturers Hanover's logo design and moved into its headquarters at [[270 Park Avenue]] in New York.  In corporate banking, Manufacturers Hanover was better established with larger, blue-chip companies, whereas Chemical had been stronger with small- and medium-sized businesses.<ref name=chemicalking>[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/11/business/a-market-where-chemical-is-king.html A Market Where Chemical is King].  New York Times, January 11, 1987</ref>  

Nationally, the combined Chemical bank became one of the largest lenders to U.S. companies and was the arguably the leader in loan syndications globally.  Additionally, Chemical took a leading role providing foreign exchange, interest rate and currency swaps, corporate finance services, cash management, corporate and institutional trust, trade services and funds transfer. Chemical operated one of the nation's largest bank credit card franchises and was a major originator and servicer of home mortgages.<ref>[http://www.chasealum.org/article.html?aid=197 The History of Chemical Bank].  JPMorgan Chase Archives</ref>

In 1996, Chemical acquired [[The Chase Manhattan Corporation]] in a merger valued at $10 billion to create the largest financial institution in the United States.  Although Chemical was the acquirer, the bank adopted the [[Chase (bank)|Chase]] brand, which was considered to be better known, particularly internationally.  Chase, which had been the largest bank in the U.S. had fallen to sixth, while Chemical was the third largest bank at the time of the merger.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/29/us/banking-s-new-giant-deal-chase-chemical-agree-merge-10-billion-deal-creating.html Banking's New Giant: The Deal; Chase and Chemical Agree to Merge in $10 Billion Deal Creating Largest U.S. Bank].

New York Times, March 29, 1996</ref>

The bank continued to operate under the Chase brand until its acquisition of [[J.P. Morgan & Co.]] in December 2000 to form [[JPMorgan Chase & Co.]]  Throughout all of these acquisitions, Chemical's original management team, led by [[Walter V. Shipley]] remained in charge of the bank.  When the combined bank purchased J.P. Morgan & Co., [[William B. Harrison, Jr.]], who had been a longtime Chemical executive, was named CEO of the combined firm.  Additionally, many of Chemical's businesses remaining intact through the various mergers.  Chemical's [[private equity]] group for example, was renamed multiple times, ultimately becoming [[JP Morgan Partners]] before completing a spin-out from the bank, as [[CCMP Capital]], after the bank's 2004 merger with [[Bank One]].

===Electronic banking===
Chemical was among the pioneers of electronic [[online banking]].  On September 2, 1969, Chemical installed the first [[automated teller machine]] (ATM) at its branch in [[Rockville Centre, New York]].  The first ATMs were designed to dispense a fixed amount of cash when a user inserted a specially coded card.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=XZMrIchANY4C&pg=PA266 1969: the year everything changed].  Skyhorse Publishing Inc., 2009 </ref>  A Chemical Bank advertisement boasted "On Sept. 2 our bank will open at 9:00 and never close again."<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=BtEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA84 50 Inventions].  Popular Mechanics, December 2005</ref>  Chemicals' ATM, initially known as a Docuteller was designed by [[Donald Wetzel]] and his company [[Docutel]].  Chemical executives were initially hesitant about the electronic banking transition given the high cost of the early machines.  Additionally, executives were concerned that customers would resist having machines handling their money.<ref>[http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/comphist/wetzel.htm Smithsonian : Interview with Don Wetzel]</ref> 

[[File:Pronto (Chemical Bank) logo c1985.png|thumb|left|240px|Chemical's PRONTO program, launched in 1982, was one of the earliest attempts to offer [[online banking]] services to consumers via their personal computers]]

In 1982, Chemical initiated the first personal computer based banking system when it launched a pilot electronic banking program called Pronto.<ref name=nytpronto83>[http://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/29/business/home-banking-by-computer.html? Home Banking by Computer].  New York Times, March 29, 1983</ref>  Chemical had spent $20 million to develop the software for Pronto.<ref name=nytpronto83 />  The system, which worked with the [[ATARI]] console, began in New York and served 200 Chemical Bank customers. Pronto was an extension of other electronic banking services offered by Chemical that  included a corporate cash-management system and its growing ATM network and was one of the largest early foray by a bank into home computer based banking.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950787,00.html Home Finance in an Electronic Age].  TIME, September 20, 1982</ref>  However, a year after launching Pronto only 21,000 of Chemical's 1.15 million customers were using the system, in large part due to the high monthly subscription costs that Chemical charged customers to use it.<ref name=piggy>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959625,00.html Brave New Piggy Bank]. TIME, July 15, 1985</ref>  By 1985, it was clear that Pronto, which was heavily promoted by Chemical was growing much slower than anticipated.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/09/business/the-executive-computer-when-technology-outpaces-needs.html The Executive Computer; When Technology Outpaces Needs].  New York Times, June 9, 1985</ref>  

In 1985, Chemical and [[BankAmerica]], another pioneer in electronic banking, entered into a joint venture with [[AT&T]] and [[Time Inc.]], known as Covidea, to market banking and discount stock-brokerage services to computer-equipped households.<ref name=piggy />  By combining resources and sharing costs, the four firms hope to reduce the risk of large and protracted losses.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1985-06-04/business/fi-6668_1_home-banking B of A, Chemical, AT&T and Time Plan Home Banking].  LA Times, June 04, 1985
</ref>  Eventually Chemical discontinued its efforts in 1989 at a loss of nearly $30 million.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/07/business/banks-plea-drop-that-checkbook.html Banks' Plea: Drop That Checkbook].
