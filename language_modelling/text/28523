'''Power Symphony''' is a [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] band from [[Milan, Italy]]. The band formed in the beginning of the 1990s. The band released two full length albums and one EP. Although no official statement has been made to the public as to the disbanding of the group, lack of activity seems to point in that direction. Their third studio album, Futurepast, never saw release and their website stopped being updated in 2004.
