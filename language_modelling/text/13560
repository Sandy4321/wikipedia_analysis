The '''FIFA World Cup''', often simply the '''World Cup''', is an international [[association football]] competition contested by the senior [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national teams]] of the members of ''F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association'' ([[FIFA]]), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|inaugural tournament in 1930]], except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the [[Second World War]]. The current champions are [[Spain national football team|Spain]], who won the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 tournament]] in [[South Africa]].

The current format of the tournament involves 32 teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month; this phase is often called the ''World Cup Finals''. A [[FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification phase]], which currently takes place over the preceding three years, is used to determine which teams qualify for the tournament together with the host nation(s).

The 19 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight different national teams. [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]<!--For consistency, British English is used throughout the article, which treats teams as plural nouns, e.g., "Brazil are" instead of "Brazil is".--> have won five times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are [[Italy national football team|Italy]], with four titles; [[Germany national football team|West Germany]], with three titles; [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and inaugural winners [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], with two titles each; and [[England national football team|England]], [[France national football team|France]], and [[Spain national football team|Spain]], with one title each.

The World Cup is among the world's most widely viewed sporting events; an estimated 715.1 million people watched the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|final match]] of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] held in [[Germany]].<ref name="2006coverage">{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/marketing/news/newsid=111247/index.html |title=2006 FIFA World Cup broadcast wider, longer and farther than ever before |work=FIFA.com |publisher=[[FIFA|F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association]] |date=6 February 2007 |accessdate=11 October 2009}}</ref>

The next three World Cups will be hosted by [[Brazil]] in [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]], [[Russia]] in [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]], and [[Qatar]] in [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]].

==History==
{{Main|History of the FIFA World Cup}}

===Previous international competitions===
The world's first international football match was a challenge match played in [[Glasgow]] in 1872 between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1872-00/1872-73/M0001Sco1872.html |title=England National Football Team Match No. 1 |publisher=England Football Online |accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref> which ended in a 0<U+2013>0 draw. The first international tournament, the inaugural edition of the [[British Home Championship]], took place in 1884.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerway.com/news/2007/November/22/british-pm-backs-return-of-home-nations-championship |title=British PM backs return of Home Nations championship |publisher=Agence France-Presse |accessdate=16 December 2007}}</ref> As football grew in popularity in other parts of the world at the turn of the 20th century, it was held as a [[demonstration sport]] with no medals awarded at the [[Football at the 1900 Summer Olympics|1900]] and [[Football at the 1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Summer Olympics]] (however, the IOC has retroactively upgraded their status to official events), and at the [[Football at the 1906 Summer Olympics|1906 Intercalated Games]].<ref>{{cite web |first1=S<U+00F8>ren |last1=Elbech |first2=Karel |last2=Stokkermans |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tableso/ol1906f.html |title=Intermediate Games of the IV. Olympiad |publisher=[[rec.sport.soccer Statistics Foundation]] |date=26 June 2008}}</ref>

After [[FIFA]] was founded in 1904, it tried to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906. These were very early days for international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having been a failure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/fifa/historyfifa2.html |title=History of FIFA <U+2013> FIFA takes shape |work=FIFA.com |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association |accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref>

At the [[Football at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]], football became an official competition. Planned by [[The Football Association]] (FA), England's football governing body, the event was for [[amateurism|amateur]] players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great Britain (represented by the [[England national amateur football team]]) won the [[gold medal]]s. They repeated the feat in [[Football at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1912]] in [[Stockholm]].

With the Olympic event continuing to be contested only between amateur teams, [[Thomas Lipton|Sir Thomas Lipton]] organised the [[Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy]] tournament in [[Turin]] in 1909. The Lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs (not national teams) from different nations, each one of which represented an entire nation. The competition is sometimes described as ''The First World Cup'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shrewsbury.gov.uk/Public/news/thomaslipton.htm |title='The First World Cup'. The Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy |publisher=[[Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council]] |date=10 October 2003 |accessdate=11 April 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031129221811/http://www.shrewsbury.gov.uk/Public/news/thomaslipton.htm |archivedate=29 November 2003}}</ref> and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from Italy, Germany and Switzerland, but the FA of England refused to be associated with the competition and declined the offer to send a professional team. Lipton invited [[West Auckland Town F.C.|West Auckland]], an amateur side from [[County Durham]], to represent England instead. West Auckland won the tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title.

In 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympic tournament]] as a "world football championship for amateurs", and took responsibility for managing the event.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/fifa/historyfifa3.html |title=History of FIFA <U+2013> More associations follow |work=FIFA.com |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association |accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref> This paved the way for the world's first intercontinental football competition, at the [[Football at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Summer Olympics]], contested by [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] and thirteen European teams, and won by [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Reyes |first=Macario |date=18 October 1999 |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tableso/ol1920f-det.html |title=VII. Olympiad Antwerp 1920 Football Tournament |publisher=rec.sport.soccer Statistics Foundation |accessdate=10 June 2006 }}</ref> [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] won the next two Olympic football tournaments in [[Football at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924]] and [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928]]. Those were also the first two open world championships, as 1924 was the start of FIFA's professional era.

===World Cups before World War II===
[[File:Estadiocentenario.JPG|thumb|[[Centenario Stadium|Estadio Centenario]], the location of the first World Cup final in 1930 in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]]]]
Due to the success of the Olympic football tournaments, FIFA, with [[List of Presidents of FIFA|President]] [[Jules Rimet]] the driving force, again started looking at staging its own international tournament outside of the Olympics. On 28 May 1928, the FIFA Congress in [[Amsterdam]] decided to stage a world championship itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/fifa/historyfifa4.html |title=History of FIFA <U+2013> The first FIFA World Cup |work=FIFA.com |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association |date=19 November 2007}}</ref> With Uruguay now two-time official football world champions and to celebrate their [[centenary]] of independence in 1930, FIFA named [[Uruguay]] as the host country of the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|inaugural World Cup tournament]].

The national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean for European sides. Indeed, no European country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition. Rimet eventually persuaded teams from [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], [[France national football team|France]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]], and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] to make the trip. In total thirteen nations took part: seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America.

The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously on 13 July 1930, and were won by [[France national football team|France]] and [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]], who defeated [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 4<U+2013>1 and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] 3<U+2013>0 respectively. The first goal in World Cup history was scored by [[Lucien Laurent]] of France.<ref>{{cite web |first=John F |last=Molinaro |title=Lucien Laurent: The World Cup's First Goal Scorer |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/worldcup2006/history/events/laurent_lucien.html |accessdate=6 May 2007}}</ref> In the [[1930 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] defeated [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] 4<U+2013>2 in front of a crowd of 93,000 people in [[Montevideo]], and in doing so became the first nation to win the World Cup.<ref name="origin">{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-201_02e_fwc-origin_8816.pdf |title=FIFA World Cup Origin |format=PDF |work=FIFA.com |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association |accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref>

After the creation of the World Cup, the [[1932 Summer Olympics]], held in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], did not plan to include football as part of the schedule due to the low popularity of [[Soccer in the United States|the sport in the United States]], as [[American football]] had been growing in popularity. FIFA and the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] also disagreed over the status of amateur players, and so football was dropped from the Games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=8229/news/newsid=92851.html |title=The Olympic Odyssey so far...

The issues facing the early World Cup tournaments were the difficulties of intercontinental travel, and war. Few South American teams were willing to travel to Europe for the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] and [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]] tournaments, with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] the only South American team to compete in both. The 1942 and 1946 competitions, which [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Brazil]] sought to host,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cristal.com.pe/articulo/los-datos-mas-curiosos-de-la-fiesta-del-futbol-brasil-1950 |title=Los datos m<U+00E1>s curiosos de la Fiesta del F<U+00FA>tbol - Brasil 1950 |accessdate=17 April 2012 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120701133216/http://www.cristal.com.pe/articulo/los-datos-mas-curiosos-de-la-fiesta-del-futbol-brasil-1950 |archivedate=1 July 2012}}</ref> were cancelled due to [[World War II]] and its aftermath.

===World Cups after World War II===
The [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]], held in [[Brazil]], was the first to include British participants. [[Home Nations|British teams]] withdrew from FIFA in 1920, partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with, and partly as a protest against foreign influence on football,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0001/index.shtml |title=Scotland and the 1950 World Cup |publisher=BBC |accessdate=13 May 2007}}</ref> but rejoined in 1946 following FIFA's invitation.<ref>[[#glanville|Glanville]]</ref> The tournament also saw the return of 1930 champions [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], who had boycotted the previous two World Cups. Uruguay won the tournament again after defeating the host nation Brazil, in the match called "[[Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|Maracanazo]]" (Portuguese: ''Maracana<U+00E7>o'').

[[File:World cup countries best results and hosts.PNG|600px|center|Map of countries' best results]]
In the tournaments between 1934 and [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]], 16 teams competed in each tournament, except in 1938, when [[Austria national football team|Austria]] was [[Anschluss|absorbed]] into [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] after qualifying, leaving the tournament with 15 teams, and in 1950, when [[India national football team|India]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] withdrew, leaving the tournament with 13 teams.<ref>[[#glanville|Glanville]], p45</ref> Most of the participating nations were from Europe and South America, with a small minority from North America, Africa, Asia and Oceania. These teams were usually defeated easily by the European and South American teams. Until 1982, the only teams from outside Europe and South America to advance out of the first round were: [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]], semi-finalists in 1930; [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]], quarter-finalists in 1938; [[Korea DPR national football team|Korea DPR]], quarter-finalists in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]]; and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], quarter-finalists in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]].

===Expansion to 32 teams===
The tournament was expanded to 24 teams in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]],<ref>[[#glanville|Glanville]], p238</ref> and then to 32 in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]],<ref>[[#glanville|Glanville]], p359</ref> also allowing more teams from Africa, Asia and North America to take part. Since then, teams from these regions have enjoyed more success, with several having reached the quarter-finals: [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], quarter-finalists in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]]; [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]], quarter-finalists in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]]; [[Korea Republic national football team|Korea Republic]], finishing in fourth place in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]; [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]], along with [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]], both quarter-finalists in 2002; and [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] as quarter-finalists in 2010. Nevertheless, European and South American teams continue to dominate, e.g., the quarter-finalists in 1994, 1998 and 2006 were all from Europe or South America.

Two hundred teams entered the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] qualification rounds; 198 nations attempted to qualify for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], while a record 204 countries entered qualification for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/southafrica2010/organisation/media/newsid=122766/index.html |title=Record number of 204 teams enter preliminary competition |work=FIFA.com |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association |date=30 March 2007 |accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref>

===Other FIFA tournaments===
An equivalent tournament for [[Women's association football|women's football]], the [[FIFA Women's World Cup]], was first held in [[FIFA Women's World Cup 1991|1991]] in the [[People's Republic of China]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/index.html |title=FIFA Women's World Cup |work=FIFA.com |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association |accessdate=22 December 2007}}</ref> The women's tournament is smaller in scale and profile than the men's, but is growing; the number of entrants for the 2007 tournament was 120, more than double that of 1991.

Football has been included in every [[Summer Olympic Games]] except 1896 and 1932. Unlike many other sports, the men's [[Football at the Summer Olympics|football tournament at the Olympics]] is not a top-level tournament, and since 1992, an under-23 tournament with each team allowed three over-age players.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/regulations_olympics_beijing_2008_en_6198.pdf |title=Regulations Men's Olympic Football Tournament 2008 |format=PDF |work=FIFA.com |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association |accessdate=22 December 2007}}</ref> Women's football made its Olympic debut in 1996, and is contested between full national sides with no age restrictions.

The [[FIFA Confederations Cup]] is a tournament held one year before the World Cup at the World Cup host nation(s) as a dress rehearsal for the upcoming World Cup. It is contested by the winners of each of the six FIFA confederation championships, along with the FIFA World Cup champion and the host country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/confederationcup/index.html |title=FIFA Confederations Cup |work=FIFA.com |accessdate=22 December 2007 |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association}}</ref>

FIFA also organises international tournaments for youth football ([[FIFA U-20 World Cup]], [[FIFA U-17 World Cup]], [[FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup]], [[FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup]]), club football ([[FIFA Club World Cup]]), and football variants such as [[futsal]] ([[FIFA Futsal World Cup]]) and [[beach soccer]] ([[FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup]]). Since the 2010 edition, the U-20 Women's World Cup has played the same role in women's football as the Confederations Cup plays in the men's game. When the U-20 Women's World Cup is held the year before the Women's World Cup, both tournaments are awarded in a single bidding process, with the U-20 tournament serving as a dress rehearsal for the larger competition.

==Trophy==
{{Main|FIFA World Cup Trophy}}
[[File:Wohlfahrtsbriefmarke-fifa.jpg|right|thumb|The [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] on a German [[Postage stamp|stamp]]]]
From 1930 to 1970, the ''[[FIFA World Cup Trophy#Jules Rimet Trophy|Jules Rimet Trophy]]'' was awarded to the World Cup winner. It was originally simply known as the ''World Cup'' or ''Coupe du Monde'', but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president [[Jules Rimet]] who set up the first tournament. In [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]], [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]'s third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. However, the trophy was stolen in 1983, and has never been recovered, apparently melted down by the thieves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/worldcup/julesrimettrophy.html |title=Jules Rimet Trophy |work=FIFA.com |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association |accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref>

After 1970, a new trophy, known as the ''[[FIFA World Cup Trophy#FIFA World Cup Trophy|FIFA World Cup Trophy]]'', was designed. The experts of FIFA, coming from seven different countries, evaluated the 53 presented models, finally opting for the work of the Italian designer [[Silvio Gazzaniga]]. The new trophy is {{convert|36|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} high, made of solid 18 [[carat (purity)|carat]] (75%) gold and weighs {{Convert|6.175|kg|1|abbr=on}}. The base contains two layers of semi-precious [[malachite]] while the bottom side of the trophy bears the engraved year and name of each FIFA World Cup winner since [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]]. The description of the trophy by Gazzaniga was: "The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/worldcup/trophies.html |title=FIFA World Cup Trophy |work=FIFA.com |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association |accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref>

This new trophy is not awarded to the winning nation permanently. World Cup winners retain the trophy until the next tournament and are awarded a gold-plated replica rather than the solid gold original.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/marketingtv/marketing/fifaassets/trophy.html |title=FIFA Assets <U+2013> Trophy |work=FIFA.com |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association |accessdate=19 November 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071104165903/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/marketingtv/marketing/fifaassets/trophy.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=4 November 2007}}</ref>

At the present, all members (players, coaches, and managers) of the top three teams receive medals with an insignia of the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy#FIFA World Cup Trophy|World Cup Trophy]]; winners' (gold), runner-ups' (silver), and third-place (bronze). In the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 edition]], fourth-place medals were awarded to hosts [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea]]. Prior to the 1978 tournament, medals were only awarded to the eleven players on the pitch at the end of the final and the third-place match. In November 2007, FIFA announced that all members of World Cup-winning squads between 1930 and 1974 were to be retroactively awarded winners' medals.<ref name="espnheroes">{{cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=484715&cc=4716 |title=122 forgotten heroes get World Cup medals |work=ESPNSoccernet.com |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=25 November 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8093891.stm |title=World Cup 1966 winners honoured |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/06/11/greavsie-gets-66-medal-115875-21431367/ |title=Jimmy Greaves finally gets his 1966 World Cup medal |work=Mirror.co.uk |publisher=MGN}}</ref>

===Qualification===
{{Main|FIFA World Cup qualification}}
Since the second World Cup in [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]], qualifying tournaments have been held to thin the field for the final tournament.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminarydraw/news/newsid=576440.html |title=FIFA World Cup qualifying: Treasure-trove of the weird and wonderful |work=FIFA |accessdate=23 December 2007 }}</ref> They are held within the six FIFA continental zones ([[Confederation of African Football|Africa]], [[Asian Football Confederation|Asia]], [[CONCACAF|North and Central America and Caribbean]], [[CONMEBOL|South America]], [[Oceania Football Confederation|Oceania]], and [[UEFA|Europe]]), overseen by their respective confederations. For each tournament, FIFA decides the number of places awarded to each of the continental zones beforehand, generally based on the relative strength of the confederations' teams.

The qualification process can start as early as almost three years before the final tournament and last over a two-year period. The formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations. Usually, one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental [[play-off]]s. For example, the winner of the Oceanian zone and the fifth-placed team from the Asian zone entered a play-off for a spot in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/print?id=468907&type=story&cc= |title=2010 World Cup Qualifying |work=ESPNSoccernet.com |publisher=ESPN |date=26 November 2009 |accessdate=23 December 2009 }}</ref> From the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]] onwards, host nations receive automatic qualification to the final tournament. This right was also granted to the defending champions between 1938 and 2002, but was withdrawn from the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] onward, requiring the champions to qualify. [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], winners in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]], were the first defending champions to play qualifying matches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mencompwc/51/97/75/fs-201_19a_fwc-prel-history.pdf |title=History of the FIFA World Cup Preliminary Competition (by year) |format=PDF |work=FIFA.com |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association}}</ref>

{{For|the various formats used in previous tournaments|History of the FIFA World Cup#Format of each final tournament}}
The current final tournament features 32 national teams competing over a month in the host nation(s). There are two stages: the group stage followed by the knockout stage.<ref name="FIFAformat">{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-201_04e_fwc_formats_slots_8821.pdf |title=Formats of the FIFA World Cup final competitions 1930<U+2013>2010 |work=FIFA.com |accessdate=1 January 2008 |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association |format=PDF}}</ref>

In the group stage, teams compete within eight groups of four teams each. Eight teams are seeded, including the hosts, with the other seeded teams selected using a formula based on the [[FIFA World Rankings]] and/or performances in recent World Cups, and drawn to separate groups.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mencompwc/82/40/89/fs-201_12a_fwc-seededteams.pdf |title=FIFA World Cup: seeded teams 1930<U+2013>2010 |format=PDF |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association |work=FIFA.com}}</ref> The other teams are assigned to different "pots", usually based on geographical criteria, and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the eight groups. Since [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], constraints have been applied to the draw to ensure that no group contains more than two European teams or more than one team from any other confederation.<ref>Previously, due to there being fewer finals places and a bigger ratio of European finalists, there had been several occasions where three European teams were in a single group, for example, 1986 (West Germany, Scotland, and Denmark), 1990 (Italy, Czechoslovakia, and Austria), and 1994 (Italy, Republic of Ireland, and Norway). ({{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-201_10e-fwcdraw-history_52560.pdf |title=History of the World Cup Final Draw |format=PDF |work=FIFA.com |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association}})</ref>

Each group plays a [[round-robin tournament]], in which each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in the same group. The last round of matches of each group is scheduled at the same time to preserve fairness among all four teams.<ref>This practice has been installed since the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]]. In some cases during previous tournaments, for example, Argentina 6<U+2013>0 Peru in [[1978 FIFA World Cup|Argentina 1978]] and [[West Germany 1<U+2013>0 Austria (1982 FIFA World Cup)|West Germany 1<U+2013>0 Austria]] in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|Spain 1982]], teams that played the latter match were perceived to gain an unfair advantage by knowing the score of the earlier match, and subsequently [[Match fixing#Match fixing to a draw or a fixed score|obtaining a result that ensured advancement to the next stage]]. ({{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/worldcup2006/history/events/1978.html |title=1978 Argentina |publisher=CBC}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/worldcup2006/history/events/1982.html |title=1982 Spain |publisher=CBC}})</ref> The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within a group. Since [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], [[Three points for a win|three points have been awarded for a win]], one for a draw and none for a loss (before, winners received two points).

The ranking of each team in each group is determined as follows:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/fifa%5fwc%5fsouth%5fafrica%5f2010%5fregulations%5fen%5f14123.pdf |title=Regulations of the 2010 FIFA World Cup |format=PDF |page=41 |work=FIFA.com |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association |accessdate=21 June 2010}}</ref>
# Greatest number of points in group matches
# Greatest goal difference in group matches
# Greatest number of goals scored in group matches
# If more than one team remain level after applying the above criteria, their ranking will be determined as follows:
## Greatest number of points in head-to-head matches among those teams
## Greatest goal difference in head-to-head matches among those teams
## Greatest number of goals scored in head-to-head matches among those teams
# If any of the teams above remain level after applying the above criteria, their ranking will be determined by the drawing of lots

The knockout stage is a [[single-elimination tournament]] in which teams play each other in one-off matches, with [[extra time]] and [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootouts]] used to decide the winner if necessary. It begins with the round of 16 (or the second round) in which the winner of each group plays against the runner-up of another group. This is followed by the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the [[third place playoff|third-place match]] (contested by the losing semi-finalists), and the final.<ref name="FIFAformat" />

===Selection process===
{{Wikinews|FIFA receives eleven bids for 2018 and 2022 World Cups}}
Early World Cups were given to countries at meetings of FIFA's congress. The locations were controversial because South America and Europe were by far the two centres of strength in football and travel between them required three weeks by boat. The decision to hold the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|first World Cup]] in Uruguay, for example, led to only four European nations competing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/history/newsid_1632000/1632201.stm |title=Uruguay 1930 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 April 2002 |accessdate=13 May 2006}}</ref> The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. The decision to hold the second of these in France was disputed, as the South American countries understood that the location would alternate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/history/newsid_1632000/1632206.stm |title=France 1938 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 April 2002 |accessdate=13 May 2006}}</ref>

Since the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]], to avoid future boycotts or controversy, FIFA began a pattern of alternating the hosts between the Americas and Europe, which continued until the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. The [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], hosted jointly by South Korea and Japan, was the first one held in Asia, and the only tournament with multiple hosts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/2002/world_cup/news/2002/06/03/au_asia_rb/ |title=Asia takes World Cup center stage |date=3 June 2002 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=1 January 2008}}</ref> South Africa became the first African nation to host the World Cup in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]. The [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] will be hosted by Brazil, the first held in South America since [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7068848.stm |title=Brazil will stage 2014 World Cup |date=10 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=1 January 2008}}</ref> and will be the first occasion where consecutive World Cups are held outside Europe.

The host country is now chosen in a vote by FIFA's Executive Committee. This is done under an [[exhaustive ballot]] system. The national football association of a country desiring to host the event receives a "Hosting Agreement" from FIFA, which explains the steps and requirements that are expected from a strong bid. The bidding association also receives a form, the submission of which represents the official confirmation of the candidacy. After this, a FIFA designated group of inspectors visit the country to identify that the country meets the requirements needed to host the event and a report on the country is produced. The decision on who will host the World Cup is usually made six or seven years in advance of the tournament. However, there have been occasions where the hosts of multiple future tournaments were announced at the same time, as was the case for the [[2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids|2018 and 2022 World Cups]], which were awarded to [[Russia]] and [[Qatar]] respectively.

For the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, the final tournament is rotated between confederations, allowing only countries from the chosen confederation (Africa in 2010, South America in 2014) to bid to host the tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after the [[FIFA World Cup hosts#2006 FIFA World Cup|controversy]] surrounding Germany's victory over South Africa in the vote to host the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 tournament]]. However, the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/russia2018/organisation/media/newsid=625122/index.html |title=Rotation ends in 2018 |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association |work=FIFA.com |date=29 October 2007 |accessdate=30 March 2013}}</ref> This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder.

Six of the eight champions have won one of their titles while playing in their own homeland, the exceptions being [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], who finished as runners-up after losing the [[Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|deciding match]] on home soil in 1950, and [[Spain national football team|Spain]], which reached the second round on home soil in 1982. [[England national football team|England]] (1966) and [[France national football team|France]] (1998) won their only titles while playing as host nations. [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] (1930), [[Italy national football team|Italy]] (1934) and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] (1978) won their first titles as host nations but have gone on to win again, while [[Germany national football team|Germany]] (1974) won their second title on home soil.

Other nations have also been successful when hosting the tournament. [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] (runners-up in 1958), [[Chile national football team|Chile]] (third place in 1962), [[Korea Republic national football team|Korea Republic]] (fourth place in 2002), and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] (quarter-finals in 1970 and 1986) all have their best results when serving as hosts. So far, [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] (2010) was the only host nation to fail to advance beyond the first round.

Italy (1934 and 1938) and Brazil (1958 and 1962) are the only nations to have won consecutive titles. West Germany (1982<U+2013>1990) and Brazil (1994<U+2013>2002) are the only nations to appear in three consecutive World Cup finals. Germany have made the most top-four finishes, with twelve, while sharing the record of most top-two finishes with Brazil, with seven.

===Best performances by continental zones===
{{See also|National team appearances in the FIFA World Cup#Results by confederation|l1=FIFA World Cup results by confederation}}
To date, the final of the World Cup has only been contested by [[UEFA|European]] and [[CONMEBOL|South American]] teams. European nations have won ten titles; South American teams have won nine. Only two teams from outside these two continents have ever reached the semi-finals of the competition: [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]] ([[CONCACAF|North, Central America and Caribbean]]) in 1930 and [[Korea Republic national football team|Korea Republic]] ([[Asian Football Confederation|Asia]]) who reached the semis in 2002. The best result of an [[Confederation of African Football|African]] team is reaching the quarter-finals: [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] in 1990, [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] in 2002 and [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] in 2010. Only one [[Oceania Football Confederation|Oceanian]] qualifier, [[Australia national association football team|Australia]] in 2006, has advanced to the second round.<ref>Australia's qualification in 2006 was through the Oceanian zone as they were a member of the [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]] member during qualifying. However, on 1 January 2006, they left the Oceania Football Confederation and joined the [[Asian Football Confederation]].</ref> 

[[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], and [[Spain national football team|Spain]] are the only teams to win a World Cup outside their continental confederation; Brazil came out victorious in [[UEFA|Europe]] ([[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]]), [[CONCACAF|North America]] ([[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]) and [[Asian Football Confederation|Asia]] ([[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]), Argentina won a North American World Cup in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], while Spain won the only African World Cup in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]. Only on three occasions have consecutive World Cups been won by teams from the same continent&nbsp;<U+2013> [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and Brazil successfully defended their titles in 1938 and 1962 respectively, while Spain's 2010 triumph followed Italy's in 2006.
