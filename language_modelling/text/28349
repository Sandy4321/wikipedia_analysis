"'''Of Human Action'''" is the seventh episode of the second season of the science fiction/crime series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', and the 27th episode overall.  It was written by the staff-writing team of [[Glen Whitman]] and [[Robert Chiappetta]], and directed by producer [[Joe Chappelle]].

The episode's story takes the form of a chase involving the apparent kidnapping of the son of a Massive Dynamic scientist.

==Plot==
In [[Queens, New York]], police chase a sedan driven through a parking garage by two men keeping a teenage boy named Tyler Carson ([[Cameron Monaghan]]) in the backseat.  The police officers surround the car and draw their weapons, demanding that the men exit the car.  They do, and Tyler stays in his seat.  Without explanation, one of the officers goes to the parking ramp and jumps to his death. Another officer shoots her two remaining compatriots, then herself. The kidnappers<U+2019> crime spree continues on the road.  One of them, Hickey ( John Tench ), demands that a convenience store clerk hand over all his cash.  Another customer tries to intervene, but then takes a pot of hot coffee, pours the coffee to his face, and beats himself with the pot.  The cashier electrocutes himself.

Examining the policewoman who shot herself, [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Walter]] ([[John Noble]]) concludes that she was the victim of [[mind control]] rather than [[hypnosis]].  Theorizing that the mind control works on an auditory basis, he develops a method of combating the effects through the use of [[white noise]]. The tactical team led by [[Olivia Dunham|Olivia]] ([[Anna Torv]]) traces the kidnappers<U+2014>both of them car salesmen with no serious criminal record<U+2014>to a warehouse.  One of them drives the car through a large door, but is burnt in the explosion when the car flips.  Olivia gets the drop on the surviving kidnapper, who points a gun at his own chin and begs for her help. [[Peter Bishop|Peter]] ([[Joshua Jackson]]), wearing headphones that broadcast Walter<U+2019>s white noise, follows the ransom payment.  It leads him to Tyler, who says, <U+201C>You can take off those stupid headphones.  They won<U+2019>t work.<U+201D>

Peter is now forced into helping Tyler Carson, who has mind control powers due to his father James ([[Andrew Airlie]]) working on thought-controlled weapons systems.  Peter tries to get into Tyler<U+2019>s head by sharing his own stories of his father not believing in him, but Tyler rejects the attempts to bond.  He only needs a driver. Their destination is the home of Tyler<U+2019>s mother, whom Tyler had been told was dead.  When the two of them meet, Tyler wants her to run off so that they can be mother and son.  She refuses, and Tyler becomes enraged at her husband when he returns home.

Tyler tries to force Peter to shoot the husband, but changes the target to Broyles ([[Lance Reddick]]) when he arrives at the house with Olivia.  Peter is forced to shoot Broyles, but manages to pull the gun off-center so that the Homeland Security agent is only hit in the shoulder. After Peter crashes the car that both he and Tyler are in, Tyler is brought unconscious into custody.  Nina Sharp ([[Blair Brown]]) writes a message to the absent William Bell updating him on the status of the Carson-Penrose experiments.  (Claus Penrose is a scientist seen caring for a genetically engineered killer in the much earlier episode <U+201C>The Same Old Story<U+201D>.)  Tyler is one of many identical boys placed with foster families, and James was his assigned guardian, not his father.

==Production==
"Of Human Action" was shot in Vancouver in September 2009, and the crew wrapped up production during the middle of the month. They began working on the following episode, "[[August (Fringe)|August]]" right away.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/09/fringe-the-definitive-and-exhaustive-chat-with-john-noble.html |title='Fringe': The complete and definitive chat with John Noble |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=Hanson |first=Andrew |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2011-05-17}}</ref>

To simulate the cop falling in the opening scene, the special effects department had the stunt double fall 52 feet onto an 18x24 feet airbag, which they referred to as "old-fashioned" because they used the airbag rather than wires. Trevor Jones, the stuntman doing the scene, commented during shooting that his fall had a small margin of error, because of the small airbag and [[cement]] walls surrounding the area, "if you land off center maybe three or four feet, then you're going to get pitched in that direction". To aid Jones, a large X was placed on the airbag. A scene later in the episode involves a car fleeing through a garage door, only to hit a concrete wall, flip over, and burst into flames. To create the scene, the crew used two externally-identical cars; one was drivable, and the other was a shell of car, and was hooked to a cable rig. After taking a week to get everything set up, the crew used a nitrogen cannon to launch the second, undrivable car through the garage door via wires.<ref name=analyze>{{cite video |people=Cameron Monaghan, [[John Noble]], [[Andrew Airlie]], John Tench, Doron Bell, Michael Mitchell, Trevor Jones, [[Anna Torv]], Bob Comer, David Baron |date=2010 |title=Analyzing the Scene for "Of Human Action"| medium=DVD |publisher=[[Warner Bros.]] Television |location=''Fringe: The Complete Second Season'' Disc 2 }}</ref>

==Cultural references==
In honor of ''[[The Simpsons]]''{{'s}} 20th anniversary, several shows in Fox's lineup contained references to the show. In "Of Human Action", Tyler uses a [[Homer Simpson]] [[Pez]] dispenser to store his mind-control drugs, and the town he and Peter journey to is Springfield, the same name of the town in ''The Simpsons''; when Springfield appears in the sky, no state is shown, just like the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#Location|ambiguous state in ''The Simpsons'']].<ref name=latimes/>

==Reception==
===Ratings===
"Of Human Action" was watched by an estimated 5.89 million viewers in the United States, with a 2.2 ratings among adults 18<U+2013>49, the season average. This was a 29% increase from the previous episode's 1.7 rating, though that episode's low ratings have been attributed to the unexpected end to the [[2009 World Series|World Series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/11/20/tv-ratings-flashforward-slides-vampire-diaries-down-greys-ties-series-low/34155|first=Bill|last=Gorman|title=Updated TV Ratings: ''FlashForward'' Slides, ''Vampire Diaries'' Down, ''Grey's'' Ties Series Low|publisher=''TV by the Numbers''|date=2009-11-13|accessdate=2011-02-15}}</ref>

===Reviews===
"Of Human Action" got a very positive reaction from [[MTV]]'s Movies Blog, with blogger Josh Wigler writing, "As a stand-alone episode with some interesting character insight, this week's "Fringe" was a success. It might also be a mythological success, too, should the big reveal at the end <U+2014> the fact that Massive Dynamic has inundated multiple children with telepathic abilities <U+2014> pan out in future episodes."<ref name= "epaction">{{cite news |last=Wigler |first=Josh |url= http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/11/12/fringe-episode-207-of-human-action/ |title='Fringe' Episode 2.07: 'Of Human Action'  |work=[[MTV]] |date=2009-11-12 |accessdate=2010-07-24}}</ref>

The [[A. V. Club]]'s Noel Murray had a more mixed reaction, giving the episode a rating of C+ and criticizing lead guest actor Cameron Monaghan. "And in this role, he was a drag, playing "rebellious teen" in a stock, wooden way, with no extra layers. Also, nobody<U+2014>not even Joshua Jackson, whom I've come to appreciate more as an actor over the run of this show<U+2014>could make the "My mind is being controlled!" scenes look anything other than goofy." Murray also said, "Yet for all my griping, I was quite taken with the theme of this episode, and the motifs that writers Robert Chiappetta and Glen Whitman and director Joe Chappelle used to support it. From the [[tin foil hat|tinfoil]] Peter Pan hats that Walter and Astrid wear (to thwart what Walter presumes to be Massive Dynamic's mind-reading capabilities) to Tyler popping the medication that grants him his powers out of a Pez dispenser, there's a lot in "Of Human Action" about childish things."<ref name= "tvclub">{{cite news |last=Murray |first=Noel |url= http://www.avclub.com/articles/of-human-action,35339/ |title="Fringe" <U+201C>Of Human Action<U+201D>  |work=[[The A.
