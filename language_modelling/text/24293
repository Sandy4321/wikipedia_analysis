== History ==
[[File:Goa - St. Francis Xavier's Church.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The ornamented entrance to the church.]]

Construction work on the church began in 1594 and the church was consecrated in May 1605 by the archbishop, Dom Fr. [[Aleixo de Menezes]]. This [[world heritage]] monument has emerged as a landmark in the [[history of Christianity]]. It contains the body of St. Francis Xavier, a very close friend of St. [[Ignatius Loyola]] with whom he founded the [[Society of Jesus]], the (Jesuits). Francis Xavier died on [[Sancian]] Island while en route to continental [[China]] on (December 2, 1552). 

The body of Francis Xavier was first taken to [[Portuguese Malacca]] and two years later shipped back to Goa. It is said that the saint's body was as fresh as the day it was buried. Although some critics suggest this is the body of [[Thotagamuwe Sri Rahula Thera]] a renowned Buddhist monk whose incorrupt body was smuggled by the Portuguese from the remote village of Ambana in Sri Lanka.<ref name="BDS">{{cite web | url=http://www.lakehouse.lk/budusarana/2006/01/29/Budu13.pdf | title=Ven. Thotagamuwe Sri Rahula Thera Scholar monk par excellence | publisher=Lake House | date=Sunday January 29, 2006 | accessdate=1 October 2013 | author=Himbutana, Gopitha Peiris}}</ref>  The remains of the saint still attract a huge number of devotees (Christian and non-Christian alike) from all over the world, especially during the public viewing of his body every ten years (last held in 2004). The saint is said to have miraculous powers of healing. 

This is one of the oldest [[church (building)|church]]es in [[Goa]], as well as in [[India]]. The floor is of [[marble]] inlaid with precious stones. Apart from the elaborate gilded altars, the interior of the church is simple. The [[church (building)|church]] also holds paintings of scenes taken from the life of St. Francis Xavier. The mausoleum, on the top of which is placed the silver casket with the body of St. Francis Xavier (1696), was the gift of the last of the [[Medicis]], [[Cosimo III]], the [[Grand Duke of Tuscany]]. 

The mausoleum was designed by the 17th-century Florentine sculptor [[Giovanni Battista Foggini]]. It took ten years to complete. The casket containing his body is made of [[silver]]. The holy [[relics]] of the saint are displayed every ten years during the anniversary of the saint's death. His liturgical feast is the third of December. 

On the upper level, overlooking the tomb, is the [http://www.dommartin.us/Basilica%20ptgs/Basilica%20ptgs%20index.htm Bom Jesus Basilica Art Gallery], containing the works of the Goan surrealist painter, [http://www.dommartin.us Dom Martin]. 

Author and fellow Jesuit [[Anthony De Mello]] was also from Goa and does mention the basilica in his writings.

The Basilica of Bom Jesus is more than 408 years old and is open to the public everyday. The body of St. Francis Xavier is kept in a well-decorated casket, which can be seen in the photographs below. Solemn exhibitions of the 'body' are held every ten years. Some photos taken inside the church are attached for better understanding of the art work of that time. These art works are called "murals".
