In an interview with [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]], MacFarlane said the following about his close call:
{{cquote|The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment.

I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that in the back of my head.<ref name=TVShows>{{cite web |url=
