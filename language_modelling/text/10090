'''Hurricane Irene<U+2013>Olivia'''  was the first actively tracked [[tropical cyclone]] which moved into the eastern Pacific Ocean from the [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|Atlantic basin]]. It originated as a tropical depression on September 11, 1971, in the tropical Atlantic. The cyclone tracked nearly due westward at a low latitude, passing through the southern Windward Islands and later over northern South America. In the southwest Caribbean Sea, it intensified to a tropical storm and later a hurricane. Irene made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on southeastern Nicaragua on September&nbsp;19, and maintained its circulation as it crossed the low-lying terrain of the country. Restrengthening after reaching the Pacific, Irene was renamed Hurricane Olivia, which ultimately attained peak winds of 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h). Olivia weakened significantly before moving ashore on the [[Baja California Peninsula]] on September&nbsp;30; the next day it dissipated.

In the Atlantic, Irene produced moderate rainfall and winds along its path, although impact was greatest in Nicaragua where it moved ashore as a hurricane. A total of 96&nbsp;homes were destroyed, and 1,200&nbsp;people were left homeless. The rainfall resulted in widespread flooding, killing three people in [[Rivas, Nicaragua|Rivas]]. In neighboring Costa Rica, Hurricane Irene caused more than $1&nbsp;million ([[United States Dollar|USD]]) in damage to the banana crop. Later, the remnants of Hurricane Olivia produced rainfall in the southwest United States. Flooding was reported near [[Yuma, Arizona]], which closed a major highway, and the moisture produced snowfall in higher elevations in the Rocky Mountains.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Irene-Olivia 1971 track.png}}
The origins of the hurricane were from a [[tropical wave]] that exited the west African coast on September&nbsp;7. It moved rapidly westward, developing into a tropical depression on September&nbsp;11 about 800&nbsp;miles (1300&nbsp;km) east of the [[Windward Islands]].<ref name="mwr">{{cite journal|volume=100|issue=04|work=[[Monthly Weather Review]]|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|pages=256<U+2013>267|date=April 1972|accessdate=2009-06-07|title=Atlantic Hurricane Season of 1971|url=http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=res-loc&uri=urn%3Anoaa%3Apdf%3Afile%3Amwr-100-04-0256.pdf|format=PDF|author=R.H.

Tropical Storm Irene gradually intensified as it continued across the southwestern Caribbean Sea. Late on September&nbsp;18, the storm attained hurricane status a short distance off the coast of Central America, with 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) winds, its peak intensity in the Atlantic Ocean.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} As it strengthened, it developed an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] and spiral [[rainband#Tropical cyclones|rainbands]] that extended across Panama into the Pacific Ocean.<ref name="mwr"/> Hurricane Irene weakened slightly as it approached the coast, although its pressure dropped to 989&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|mbar]].

After reaching the Pacific Ocean on September&nbsp;20, the depression restrengthened to attain tropical storm status; upon doing so, it was re-designated by a new name, Olivia.<ref name="1971t"/><ref name="pmwr">{{cite journal|volume=100|issue=04|work=[[Monthly Weather Review]]|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|pages=276<U+2013>293|date=April 1972|accessdate=2009-06-09|title=Eastern Pacific hurricane season of 1971|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/100/mwr-100-04-0276.pdf|format=PDF|author=William J.

As an [[Pacific hurricane|Eastern Pacific tropical cyclone]], Olivia maintained well-defined [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] and inflow. It gradually intensified as it paralleled the southern Central America coastline. Late on September&nbsp;21, a [[Hurricane Hunters]] flight reported winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) and an eye 23&nbsp;miles (37&nbsp;km) in diameter; based on the readings, Olivia was upgraded to hurricane status. For several days, Olivia moved west to west-northwestward off the coast of Mexico, although its exact intensity fluctuations were unknown, due to lack of significant observations. On September&nbsp;25, the eye became very pronounced on satellite imagery, and based on a report from the Hurricane Hunters, it is estimated Olivia reached peak winds of 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h), about 245&nbsp;miles (395&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Manzanillo, Colima]]. The Hurricane Hunters also reported a pressure of 948&nbsp;mbar, which was the lowest reported pressure during the [[1971 Pacific hurricane season]].<ref name="pmwr"/>

The intensity of Hurricane Olivia fluctuated for two days as it turned westward away from land, due to a blocking [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] over northwestern Mexico. Early on September&nbsp;26 it weakened to winds of about 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h), before it quickly restrengthened to its previous peak intensity. Subsequently, dry air became entrained in the circulation, and Olivia began to weaken as it moved over cooler waters. The eye became disorganized and eventually dissipated. Late on September&nbsp;28 it weakened to tropical storm status, after beginning a turn to the northwest and later to the north. About 24&nbsp;hours later, Olivia weakened to tropical depression status as it approached the coastline of the [[Baja California Peninsula]]. Most of the thunderstorm activity dissipated by the time the depression moved ashore on September&nbsp;30; the next day, Olivia dissipated near the border of [[Baja California]] and [[Baja California Sur]].<ref name="pmwr"/>

As a tropical depression, the cyclone produced a wind gust of 43&nbsp;mph (69&nbsp;km/h) in Barbados.
