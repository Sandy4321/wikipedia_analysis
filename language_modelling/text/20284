In the years after Israel captured the West Bank in 1967, Jews consolidated their hold on the site. Since 1995, when Nablus was handed over to the Palestinian National Authority, the tomb became a target for violent protests by Arabs against the Israeli government. Several Israeli soldiers were killed at the site and in 2000 the complex was ransacked by an Arab mob. Subsequently, Israel prohibited Jewish visits to the site and the site gradually fell into disrepair. Pressure from Jewish groups led to infrequent visits allowed under IDF protection. Attempts to renovate the site are currently underway.

==Early traditions==

According to the [[Book of Joshua]], ''"The bones of Joseph, which the [[Children of Israel]] brought up out of Egypt, were buried in Shechem in a parcel of land [[Jacob]] bought from the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver..."''<ref>See {{bibleverse||Joshua|24:32|31}} and {{bibleverse||Genesis|33:18-20|31}}</ref> The [[Genesis Rabba]], a Jewish text, states that this site is one of three that the nations of the world cannot taunt [[Israel]] and say "you have stolen them," it being purchased "for its full price," by [[Jacob]].<ref>[[Genesis Rabba]] 79.7: "And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent...for a hundred pieces of money." Rav Yudan son of Shimon said: 'This is one of the three places where the non-Jews cannot deceive the Jewish People by saying that they stole it from them, and these are the places: Ma'arat HaMachpela, the Temple and Joseph's burial place. Ma'arat HaMachpela because it is written: 'And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver,' ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], 23:16); the Temple because it is written: 'So David gave to Ornan for the place,' ([[I Chronicles]], 21:26); and Joseph's burial place because it is written: 'And he bought the parcel of ground...Jacob bought Shechem.' (Genesis, 33:19)."

An interesting suggestion in favour of the current Nablus site is made by Jewish traveller, Loewe,<ref>Loewe, in Ally. Zeitung dt'S Judenthvms, Leipzig, 1839, No. 50</ref> who based his assumption on the peculiar form and nature of the geography surrounding the tomb. He cites Scripture which calls the place neither ''emek'' (valley) or ''shefela'' (plain), but by the individual name of ''chelkat ha-Sadeh'' (portion of field); "and in the whole of Palestine there is not such another plot to be found, a dead level, without the least hollow or swelling in a circuit of two hours."<ref name=DOB/>

==History of the identification and use of the site==
===19th century accounts===
[[File:Joseph's Tomb.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=A black and white photograph showing a low stone wall enclosing a courtyard in front of a low building with an entry through a pointed arch with a small dome behind|Early 1900s]]
William Cooke Taylor (1838) describes the tomb, and notes that, "The present monument... is a place of resort, not only for Jews and Christains, but Mohammedans and Samaritans; all of whom concur in the belief that it stands on the vertiable spot where the patriarch was buried." <ref>Taylor, William Cooke (1838). Illustrations Of The Bible From The Monuments of Egypt. Page 206. London: Tilt.</ref> In 1839, it was recorded that Jews frequently visited the tomb and that many inscriptions in Hebrew were visible on the walls.<ref>Andrew Alexander Bonar, Robert Murray M'Cheyne. [http://books.google.com/books?id=ceuty3kiZScC&source=gbs_navlinks_s Narrative of a mission of inquiry to the Jews from the Church of Scotland in 1839], Whyte, 1849. p. 213</ref> The site was "kept very neat and in good repair by the bounty of Jews who visited it."<ref>Church Pastoral-aid Society, London.

(No. 490, October 26, 1844) p. 280.</ref> The ''Churchman's Monthly Review'' (1847) writes that the tomb lies about two or three hundred yards to the north of [[Jacob's Well]], across the valley. It describes "a small solid erection in the form of a wagon roof, over what is supposed to be the patriarch<U+2019>s grave, with a small pillar or altar at each of its extremities, sometimes called the tombs of Ephraim and Manasseh, and the middle of an enclosure without a covering. Many visitors names, in the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] and [[Samaritan script|Samaritan]] characters, are written on the walls of this enclosure." A Hebrew inscription recalled the renovation of the structure by a Jew, Elijah son of Meir, (possibly of Egypt), in around 1749. "The Jews of Nablus take upon themselves the duty of keeping the tomb in order. They applied to us for a subscription to aid in making some repairs and we complied with their request".<ref>''[http://books.google.com/books?id=v_MDAAAAQAAJ&dq=joseph's+tomb&lr=&source=gbs_navlinks_s The Churchman's monthly review]'', Oxford University, 1847. p. 602</ref> These Hebrew and Samaritan inscriptions were still visible on the white plastered walls as late as 1980. As were small lamps in an internal recess, probably donated by Jews during the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref name=GHL/>

[[Joseph Schwarz]] (1850) identifies a village named Abulnita as the site "where Joseph lies buried". He locates this "about 2 English miles east of Shechem".<ref>Schwarz, Joseph. [http://www.jewish-history.com/Palestine/towns_joseph.html Names of the Towns of the Sons of Joseph], ''Descriptive Geography and Brief Historical Sketch of Palestine'', 1850</ref> Western travellers to [[Palestine]] in the 19th century described their impressions of the site in travelogues. [[John Ross Browne]] (1853) writes: "We also visited the reputed site of Joseph's Tomb. A rude stone building covers the pretended [[sepulcher]]; but the best authorities deny that there was any evidence that Joseph was buried here."<ref name=Brownep354>Browne, 1853, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=6BMOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA354&dq=%22joseph%27s+tomb%22+yusef&lr=#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 354].</ref> [[Howard Crosby (minister)|Howard Crosby]] also visited the site during 1851. He designated it, "the so-called tomb of Joseph," and describes it as follows: "It is a plain white Santon's tomb, or [[Wely]], such as is everywhere seen in [[Mohammedan]] countries, excepting that this one is roofless, and consequently lacks the usual white dome. In the interior, a vine grows from a corner, and spreads upon a [[Trellis (architecture)|trellis]] over the tomb, forming a pleasant bower."<ref name=Crosbyp291>Crosby, 2001, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=2B_iffOx_E4C&pg=PA276&dq=%22joseph%27s+tomb%22+sheikh&lr=&as_brr=3#v=onepage&q=%22joseph's%20tomb%22%20&f=false p. 291-2].</ref> [[Louis F<U+00E9>licien Joseph Caignart de Saulcy]] and [[Edouard de Warren]] (1853) describe it as "a small Mussalman oualy (chapel) [...] said to be the tomb of Joseph," noting it was just to the east of what the [[Arabs]] called ''Bir-Yakub'', [[Jacob's Well]].<ref name=Warrenp103>de Saulcy, 1853, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=h8wYAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA103&dq=tomb+joseph+naplouse#v=onepage&q=tomb%20joseph%20naplouse&f=false p. 103].</ref> ''A Dictionary of the Bible'' (1863) notes the peculiarity that the tomb is placed diagonally to the walls, instead of parallel, as usual.

[[Claude R. Conder]] provides a detailed description of the site in his works ''Tent Work in Palestine'' (1878), ''Survey of Western Palestine'' (1881) and ''Palestine'' (1889). He states that the enclosure is located on the road-side from Balata to <U+2018>Askar, at the end of a row of fine fig trees.  The open courtyard surrounding the tomb measures about {{convert|18|foot}} square. The plastered, [[whitewash]]ed walls, about {{convert|1|foot}} thick, are in good repair and stand {{convert|10|foot}} feet high. Entrance to the courtyard is from the north through the ruin of a little square domed building. There are two Hebrew inscriptions on the south wall, where an additional English inscription informs that "This building surrounding and covering and tomb of the patriarch Joseph was entirely rebuilt at the expense of Mr. E. T. Rogers, H. B. M.<U+2019>s Consel at Damascus, January, 1868." The tomb itself measures {{convert|6|foot}} feet long and stands {{convert|4|foot}} feet high. It consisted of a long narrow plastered block with an arched roof, having a pointed cross section. The tomb is not in line with the walls of the courtyard, which have a bearing of 202<U+00BA>, nor is it in the middle of the enclosure, being nearest to the west wall. Two short plastered pedestals with shallow cup-shaped hollows at their tops stand at the head and foot of the tomb. The hollows are blackened by fire due to the Jewish custom of burning offerings of shawls, silks or gold lace on the pillar altars. Both Jews and Samaritans burn oil lamps and incense in the pillar cavity. Conder also questions the fact that the tomb points north to south, inconsistent with Muslim tombs north of Mecca. This fact did not however diminish Muslim veneration of the shrine.<ref name=TWP>Conder, Claude R.

Authenticity of the site was confirmed by the discovery of a nearby tomb and Egyptian relics from 1600-1400 BCE during archaeological excavations undertaken in the area in 1913.<ref name=GHL/>

===Since 2000===

After the events of October 2000, the IDF prohibited Israeli access to the tomb. However, some [[Breslov (Hasidic dynasty)|Breslov]] [[Hasidic Judaism|hasidim]] and others would visit the site clandestinely under the cover of darkness, evading army and police checkpoints. In May 2002, Israeli soldiers mistakenly opened fire on a convoy of settlers taking advantage of an ongoing incursion in Nablus to visit the tomb. Seven settlers were arrested by the army for illegally entering a combat zone.<ref name=T/> As a result of [[Operation Defensive Shield]], the tomb was retaken by the IDF and shortly afterwards, in response to numerous requests, they renewed guarded tours of the tomb. One day every month at midnight as many as 800 visitors were allowed to pray at the gravesite. These visits were designed to prevent unauthorized and unprotected clandestine visits, mainly by Breslav Hassidim.<ref name=JP1>Wagner, Matthew.

In February 2003 it was reported in the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' that the grave had been pounded with hammers and that the tree at its entrance had been broken; car parts and trash littered the tomb which had a "huge hole in its dome." [[Breslov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bratslav]] leader Aaron Klieger notified and lobbied government ministers about the desecration, but the IDF said it had no plans to secure or guard the site, claiming such action would be too costly.<ref>Gutman, Matthew & Lazaroff, Tovah.

</ref>

In February 2007, thirty five [[Knesset|MK]]s wrote to the army asking them to open Joseph's Tomb to Jewish visitors for prayer.<ref name=JP1/> In May 2007, Breslov hasidim visited the site for the first time in two years and later on that year, a group of hasidim found that the gravesite had been cleaned up by the Palestinians. In the past few years the site had suffered from neglect and its appearance had deteriorated, with garbage being dumped and tires being burned there.<ref>Weiss, Efrat.

In early 2008, a group of Knesset members wrote a letter to the Prme Minister asking that the tomb be renovated: "The tombstone is completely shattered, and the holy site is desecrated in an appalling manner, the likes of which we have not seen in Israel or anywhere else in the world."<ref>Michael Freund. [http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Blogs/Message.aspx/2600 Shut Down Orient House], ''Jerusalem Post'', February 20, 2008.</ref> In February, it was reported that Israel would officially ask the Palestinian Authority to carry out repairs at the tomb,<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&cid=1201867286880 Israel to ask PA to repair Joseph's Tomb], ''Jerusalem Post'', February 03, 2008.</ref> but in response, vandals set tires on fire inside the tomb. Palestinian leader [[Mahmoud Abbas]] declared the tomb a Muslim holy site, and downplayed reports of joint Israeli-Palestinian cooperation on restoring the tomb.<ref>Aaron Klein.

As of 2009, monthly visits to the tomb in bullet-proof vehicles under heavy IDF protection are organised by the [[Yitzhar]] based organization ''Shechem Ehad''.<ref>Wagner, Matthew. [http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&cid=1239710774653 Site of Joseph's Tomb vandalized], ''Jerusalem Post'', April 23, 2009.</ref> In late April 2009, a group of Jewish worshipers found the headstone smashed and swastikas painted on the walls, as well as boot prints on the grave itself.<ref>Weiss, Efrat.

In August 2010, it was reported that the IDF and the Palestinian Authority reached an agreement on renovating the site. Israel's chief rabbis, [[Yona Metzger]] and [[Shlomo Amar]], visited and prayed at the tomb along with 500 other worshippers, the first such visit by a high-ranking Israeli delegation in 10 years.<ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3940041,00.html Rabbis witness renovation of Joseph's Tomb], ''Ynet'', August 20, 2010.</ref><ref>[http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=185387 Chief rabbis in rare visit to holy sites in Nablus, Jericho], ''Jerusalem Post'', August 20, 2010.</ref><ref>[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=310552 Army escorts 500 Israelis into Nablus shrine], ''Maan News'', August 25, 2010.</ref>
