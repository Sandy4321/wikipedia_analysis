The '''A4174''' is a major road in [[England]] which runs around the northern and eastern edge of [[Bristol]], mainly in [[South Gloucestershire]], and through the southern suburbs of Bristol. When it was first conceived it was planned to circle the whole of [[Bristol]], and even today it is known simply as "the Ring Road" by many local people, however this is technically inaccurate, as the road does not circle the whole city, instead covering roughly half of the route.

==The route==
The completed section of the northern and eastern route runs from the [[A38 road|A38]] at [[Filton]], under the [[M32 motorway]], through to [[Frenchay]], [[Bromley Heath]], [[Emerson's Green]], [[Kingswood, South Gloucestershire|Kingswood]], [[Warmley]], and [[Longwell Green]] before joining the [[A4 road (Great Britain)|A4]] at Hicks Gate junction near [[Keynsham]].  This section of the road is entirely [[dual carriageway]] and runs through several roundabouts which act as junctions. In the summer of 2005, major work was carried out to a number of these roundabouts, installing [[traffic lights]] to make them signal controlled which caused major delays. 

The road reappears just over a mile along the A4 at [[Brislington]], where it follows a valley, crosses the [[A37 road|A37]], and reaches a large roundabout in [[Hengrove Park]].  West of this roundabout a strip of land has been left undeveloped, but at present the road instead turns north terminating at the A38 in [[Bedminster]].  There have been several proposals to extend the ring road from the junction with the A4 at Hicks Gate, Keynsham, along the southern edge of [[Bristol]] as far as the [[A370 road|A370]] at [[Long Ashton]], but no action has been taken to put it into work as of January 2007.

==Future Plans==
The 2005 Greater Bristol Strategic Transport Study, commissioned by the [[South West England|regional government office]], recommended construction of the new southern route to tackle congestion.  The proposals follow the route set aside west from Hengrove Park roundabout to the A38 at Castle Farm (phase 1), and from there to the A370 near Long Ashton Park and Ride (phase 2).  There are additional recommendations (phase 3) for a new Whitchurch bypass from Hengrove Park roundabout, along the base of Dundry Hill, around Stockwood and joining the existing A4174 at Hicks Gate roundabout on the A4.<ref name=gbsts>Atkins, 2005.

(PDF)</ref>  Bristol City Council has since endorsed all three phases, hoping to begin construction of the first two phases in 2010 and 2011, and the third phase potentially some time after 2016.<ref name=sbrr>{{cite web | title=South Bristol Ring Road | work=Bristol City Council | url=http://www.bristol-city.gov.uk/ccm/content/Transport-Streets/projects-and-schemes/major-highway-schemes.en;jsessionid=6E79F40904B275EF580516E1442C0CA9 | accessdate=2006-08-25}}</ref>

Work was expected to start in late 2007, although no work has yet started as of 2008.
