The '''French ironclad ''Belliqueuse''''' (Bellicose) was a wooden-hulled, armored [[corvette]], built for the [[French Navy]] in the 1860s and designed as a cheap ironclad. She was the first French ironclad to sail around the world, which she did between December 1867 and May 1869. She spent the bulk of her career in the Pacific before returning to Toulon, where she was used as a target in 1886.

==Design and description==
''Belliqueuse'' was designed as a small and cheap [[ironclad]]<ref group=Note>Ironclad is the all-encompassing term for armored warships of this period. Armored corvettes were originally designed for the same role as traditional wooden corvettes, but this rapidly changed as the size and expense of these ships caused them to be used as second-class armored ships.</ref> suitable for foreign deployments. Her armament and armor was concentrated in the middle of the ship like a [[Central battery ship|central battery ironclad]], but unlike those ships she lacked armored transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s and was very vulnerable to [[raking fire]]. Like most ironclads of her era she was equipped with a bronze [[Naval ram|ram]]; hers weighed {{convert|2200|kg|sp=us}}.<ref name=d26>de Balincourt and Vincent-Br<U+00E9>chignac, p. 26</ref>

''Belliqueuse'' measured {{convert|68.05|m|ftin|sp=us}} at the [[waterline]] and {{convert|70|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[Length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]], with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|14.01|m|ftin|sp=us}}. She had a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|6.97|m|ftin|sp=us}} and displaced {{convert|3777|t|LT|lk=on|sp=us}}.<ref name=d27>de Balincourt and Vincent-Br<U+00E9>chignac, p. 27</ref>

===Propulsion===
The ship had a single horizontal [[Marine steam engine#Back acting|return connecting-rod steam engine]] driving a single propeller. Her engine was powered by four oval [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s. The engine produced a total of {{convert|1200|ihp|lk=on}} and gave a top speed of {{convert|11|knots|lk=in}}.<ref name=g1>Gardiner, p. 301</ref> On [[sea trial]]s the engine produced {{convert|1227|ihp}} and the ship reached {{convert|11.83|kn}}.<ref name=d27/> ''Belliqueuse'' carried {{convert|250|MT|LT}}<ref name=g1/> of coal which allowed the ship to steam for {{convert|1410|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref name=d27/>

''Belliqueuse'' was [[barque]]-rigged; initially she had a sail area of {{convert|1450|sqm|sqft|sp=us}}, but this was later increased to {{convert|1800|sqm|sqft}}<ref name=g1/> in 1869.<ref name=d27/>

===Armament===
''Belliqueuse'' mounted her four {{convert|194|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} Mod<U+00E8>le 1864 guns in the central battery on the battery deck along with four of her six  {{convert|164|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} Mod<U+00E8>le 1864 guns. The other two 164&nbsp;mm guns were carried on pivot mounts fore and aft on the upper deck. She was partially rearmed in 1870 and exchanged her 164-mm pivot guns for a pair of {{convert|138|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} Mod<U+00E8>le 1870 guns. In addition four {{convert|37|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss 5-barrel revolving guns]] each were added.<ref name=g1/> They fired a shell weighing about {{convert|500|g|lb|abbr=on}} at a muzzle velocity of about {{convert|610|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} to a range of about {{convert|3200|m|yd|sp=us}}. They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_1pounder_m1.htm|title=United States of America 1-pdr (0.45 kg) 1.46" (37 mm) Marks 1 through 15|date=15 August 2008|accessdate=22 December 2009|publisher=Navweps.com}}</ref>

===Armor===
''Belliqueuse'' was completely armored with {{convert|150|mm|in|sp=us|1}} of [[wrought iron]] from the battery deck down to {{convert|1.5|m|ftin|sp=us}} below the waterline. The sides of the battery itself were protected with {{convert|120|mm|in|sp=us|1}} of armor, but the ends were closed only by light screens. Fore and aft of the battery, her sides were unprotected.<ref name=d27/>

==Service==
''Belliqueuse'' was laid down at [[Toulon]] in September 1863, and launched on 6 September 1865. The ship began her sea trials on 30 December 1865, but did not enter service until 30 October 1866. That day she was commissioned as the [[flagship]] of the Pacific Station under command of Rear Admiral Penhoat. On 22 December 1867, the ship departed Toulon in an attempt to [[circumnavigate]] the world. ''Belliqueuse'' arrived at [[Brest, France|Brest]] on 26 May 1869 after 396 days at sea,<ref name=d27/> the first French ironclad to do so.<ref name=d28/> On 15 November 1869 she hoisted the flag of Rear Admiral Chevalier as commander of the Levant Squadron. During 1870 she was transferred to New Caledonia as flagship of the Western Pacific Division ({{lang-fr|Division de l'Oc<U+00E9>anie Occidentale}}), but returned to Toulon on 5 June 1871 after the death of Rear Admiral Chevalier. In 1872 the ship was sent to the China Station and relieved {{ship|French ironclad|Alma}} as flagship of the station on 1 October 1872. She returned to Toulon on 3 May 1874.<ref>de Balincourt and Vincent-Br<U+00E9>chignac, pp. 27<U+2013>28</ref>

''Belliqueuse'' served with the Evolutionary Squadron for six months from 5 June 1877 and was reduced to reserve afterwards. She was paid off on 15 November 1884 and struck off the Navy List on 3 May 1886. ''Belliqueuse'' was used as a target afterwards.<ref name=d28>de Balincourt and Vincent-Br<U+00E9>chignac, p. 28</ref>
