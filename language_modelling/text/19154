'''Ale-8-One''', known colloquially as '''Ale-8''', is a regional [[ginger]]-flavored [[soft drink]], distributed only in [[Kentucky]] and portions of neighboring [[United States|U.S.]] states [[Indiana]] and [[Ohio]]. It is bottled by the Ale-8-One Bottling Company, a family-owned enterprise in the small town of [[Winchester, Kentucky|Winchester]], [[Kentucky]], near [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], where the beverage is especially popular. 

Ale-8 could be described as a [[ginger ale]], but with more [[caffeine]], a fruitier flavor, less [[carbonation]], and about 1/4 fewer calories than conventional soda. 

==History==
===Early years===

Ale-8 was first created by G.L. Wainscott of Winchester, Kentucky, in 1926. According to text on the back of some Ale-8 bottles, "Wainscott was an eccentric old man; however, there was nothing odd about his creation."  Wainscott was a local bottler who had been creating and selling fruit-flavored [[Carbonated water|sodas]] since 1902. In the early years, his flagship product was Roxa-Kola, a [[cola]] introduced in 1906. 

Around that time, Wainscott began experimenting with a new recipe that, according to local legend, he had obtained while traveling in [[Northern Europe]]. In 1926 he began bottling and selling the new ginger-flavored product, believing he had successfully adapted the recipe for a local consumer base. 

In a contest to name the drink, "A Late One" was chosen as the winning entry.<ref name=kye>{{cite book |editor=Kleber, John E. |others=Associate editors: [[Thomas D. Clark]], Lowell H. Harrison, and James C. Klotter |title=''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'' |year=1992 |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, Kentucky |isbn=0813117720 |chapter=Ale-8-One}}</ref> Wainscott conceived of the "Ale-8-One" logo (designed to resemble a mail clerk's scrawl) as a pun suggesting that his product was "the latest thing" in soft drinks. 

In 1968 the company discontinued all of its other products, including Roxa-Kola, to focus solely on Ale-8.

===Recent years===

For much of its history, Ale-8 was only available in Kentucky, though it was briefly available in parts of the Southeast, including [[Florida]], in the early-1980s. In April 2002, however, the Ale-8-One Bottling Company expanded its distribution to areas of southern Ohio and Indiana through an agreement with [[Coca-Cola Enterprises]]. Today, the company also ships cases of its product directly to consumers worldwide through its [[website]]. 

In 2003 the company announced limited distribution of Diet Ale-8, its first new product since the introduction of the original Ale-8 in 1926.

Despite persistent local rumors of a buy-out by beverage giant [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]], Ale-8-One continues to be a small, family-owned enterprise. The current president is Wainscott's great-nephew, Frank A. Rogers, III.

The company reports that it presently sells about 1.5 million cases per year.

The recipe for Ale-8 is a closely guarded family secret. Reportedly, only two executives&mdash;Rogers and Fielding Rogers, Executive Vice-President and heir-apparent to the company&mdash;know the exact composition. 

According to the product label, Ale-8's ingredients include "[[carbonated water]], [[sugar]] and/or [[corn syrup|corn sweetener]], [[glycerin|glycerine]], natural and artificial flavorings, [[citric acid]], [[sodium benzoate]] ([[Food preservation|preservative]]), caramel coloring, [[phosphoric acid]], [and] [[caffeine]]." Each 12-[[fluid ounce]] (355-[[milliliter|ml]]) serving contains 37 [[milligram|mg]] of caffeine and 30 [[gram|g]] of sugars. (For comparison, the same serving of Coca Cola classic in the U.S. has 34 mg of caffeine and 39 g of sugars.) Diet Ale 8 contains 44 mg of caffeine (compared to 45 mg for Diet Coke) and no sugars.  The diet variety is sweetened with [[sucralose]], more commonly known as Splenda.

The company readily admits that natural ginger is included among Ale-8's flavorings. A trace of citrus can also be discerned.

==Social aspects of Ale-8==

[[Image:Ale8longnecks.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A 6-pack of the Ale-8 returnable long-necks]]Ale-8 is available in bottles or cans. It is widely preferred that the beverage be drunk from a glass bottle, rather than cans or plastic bottles. 

Ale-8 traditionalists are even known to refuse to drink Ale-8 from the newer glass bottles. Instead, they prefer the older "returnable" glass bottles (so-named because they can be returned to certain stores for approximately 30 cents each). The "returnable" bottles are often referred to as long-necks, while the more modern design as short-necks.

Some Kentuckians are fond of mixing Ale-8-One with one of the state's many [[Bourbon whiskey|bourbons]], such as [[Maker's Mark]] or [[Wild Turkey (bourbon)|Wild Turkey]].  This has been named the "Kentucky Gentleman" or "Kentucky Speed ball".

Ale-8 is also often mixed with [[vodka]], with the resulting concoction known as a Tender Lovin'.  

Seagram's Seven and Ale-8 are mixed to produce Kentucky Beer.
