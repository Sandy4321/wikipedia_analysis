The '''Mozel Sanders Homes''' is a public housing development located on the near north-eastside of [[Indianapolis]]. Constructed in [[1948]], they were the heart of a once-flourishing, streetcar suburban neighborhood known as simply '''"The Meadows"'''. Today, as of 2006, The Meadows is the most blighted neighborhood in Indianapolis and suffers from very severe [[urban decay]] and [[blight]]. All but seven of the original twenty-two buildings remain standing.

The area has suffered from extraordinarily high crime, including (at one point in time) having the reputation of being the city's worst neighborhood. Several efforts have been made in turning the area in the right direction, starting with several federal [[Grant (money)|grants]], and the demolition of Parkwood Projects, formerly situated to the east of Mozel Sanders. The entire neighborhood is slated for demolition, and a new, urban renewal type of neighborhood will replace it, which will be similar in nature to [[Fall Creek Place]], also in Indianapolis.
