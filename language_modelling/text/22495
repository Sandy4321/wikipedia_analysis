The four '''''Borodino'' class''' [[battlecruiser]]s (also referred to as '''''Izmail'' class''') of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] were all laid down in December 1912<ref group=Note>All dates used in this article are [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]]</ref> at [[Saint Petersburg]] for service with the [[Baltic Fleet]]. Construction of the ships was delayed as many domestic factories were already overloaded with orders and some components had to be ordered from abroad. The start of [[World War I]] slowed their construction still further as the foreign orders were often not delivered and domestic production was diverted into things more immediately useful for the war effort. The ships were launched in 1915<U+2013>16, but the outbreak of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] in 1917 put a stop to their construction, which never resumed. The incomplete hulls were later sold for scrap by the [[Soviet Union]], although some thought was given to completing the most advanced hulls. The [[Soviet Navy]] made a serious proposal in 1925 to convert ''Izmail'', the ship closest to completion, to an [[aircraft carrier]], but this plan was later cancelled as a result of political maneuvering on the part of the [[Red Army]].

==Design and development==
After the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1905 the Russian Naval General Staff decided that it needed a squadron of fast 'armored cruisers'<ref group=Note>The ''Borodino''-class ships were formally known as armored cruisers until 1915 when they were redesignated as battlecruisers ({{lang-ru|lineinyi kreiser}}) by an order of 29 July 1915.</ref><ref name=m4>McLaughlin, p. 244</ref> that could use their speed to maneuver into a position to engage the head of the enemy's battle line; much as [[T<U+014D>g<U+014D> Heihachir<U+014D>|Admiral T<U+014D>g<U+014D>]] had done during the [[Battle of Tsushima]] to the Russian fleet. Initially the Naval General Staff wanted a ship with high speed and limited protection ({{convert|28|knots|lk=on}} and a [[Belt armor|waterline belt]] of {{convert|190|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}) and construction of four such ships was approved in 5 May 1911, but the [[Duma]] session ended before they could be voted on. Preliminary bids for these ships were solicited from private builders, but they proved to be very high,<ref name=m4/> enough so that the requirements were reconsidered and a new specification was issued on 1 July 1911 for a design with only {{convert|26.5|knots}} of speed while the armor was increased to {{convert|254|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}) and the armament was to be nine {{convert|14|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns in non-[[Superfire|superfiring]] triple turrets,<ref>McLaughlin, p. 245</ref> based on a (false) rumor that the Germans were increasing the caliber of their guns.<ref>Conway's, p. 304</ref> The Navy believed that widely separating the main gun [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s improved survivability and that the open sighting hoods on their turrets prevented superfiring turrets from firing their guns over the lower turret. The Naval Ministry solicited bids from 23 shipbuilders, both domestic and foreign, on 8 September, but only seven responded, even when the deadline was extended by an extra month. A number of designs were rejected for not meeting the specified criteria, but the Artillery Section of the Main Administration of Shipbuilding had decided that it preferred four-turret designs in the meantime and new bids were solicited from the leading contenders from the first round of bidding in May 1912. The eventual winner was a design by the [[Admiralty Shipyard|Admiralty Works]] which essentially had the extra turret added to a new hull section inserted into the old three-turret design.<ref name=m56>McLaughlin, pp. 245<U+2013>46</ref>

The Duma approved construction in May 1912, before the design was finalized, and allocated 45.5 million [[ruble]]s for each ship. However the increase in the armament and consequent size of the ships raised their costs by an estimated 7 million rubles each and some money had to be diverted from the budget for the {{sclass|Svetlana|cruiser}}s. Orders were placed on 18 September 1912 for a pair of ships each from the [[Admiralty Shipyard|Admiralty Works]] and the [[Baltic Shipyard|Baltic Works]]. The first pair was to be ready for trials on 14 July 1916 and the last two on 14 September 1916.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 247</ref>

In the meantime, however, full-scale trials had been conducted using the old [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] {{ship|Russian battleship|Chesma|1886|2}} modified with armor protection identical to that used by the {{sclass|Gangut|battleship}}s then under construction. They revealed serious weaknesses in the protection scheme and the design of the ''Borodino''-class ships was modified as a consequence. The deck armor was reinforced with extra plates, the turrets roofs were increased to {{convert|150|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in thickness and the side and roof of the [[conning tower]] were increased by {{convert|100|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|125|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively. To compensate for the weights involved the rear conning tower was removed entirely and the thickness of the main belt was reduced {{convert|4.5|mm|in|abbr=on|sp=us}}. The other change was the introduction of [[mortise and tenon]] joints between the armor plates along their vertical edges to better distribute the shock of a shell impact and lessen the stress on the supporting hull structure. These changes, plus the delays imposed by the large number of ship orders already in hand, led to further delays and the launching of the first pair was postponed six months, to October 1914.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 247<U+2013>48</ref>

The outbreak of the war caused further delays as a number of components had been ordered from foreign manufacturers. The gun turrets had the most parts ordered abroad, and had the greatest problems, despite trying to find substitute vendors. For example the turrets rested on {{convert|8|in|mm|0|adj=on}} spherical [[Bearing (mechanical)|roller bearings]] made in [[Germany]], but attempts to order replacements from the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Sweden]] proved futile as no factory proved to be willing and able to make the bearings. Another example were some components for the turbines of the ''Navarin'' that were ordered from [[AG Vulcan Stettin|AG Vulcan]] in Germany. They were seized at the beginning of the war and used in the two {{sclass|Brummer|cruiser}}s built during the war.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 248<U+2013>249, 253</ref>

===General characteristics===
The ''Borodino'' class ships were {{convert|223.85|m|ftin|sp=us}} long [[length overall|overall]]. They had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|30.5|m|ftin|sp=us}} and at full load a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|8.81|m|ftin|sp=us}}. They displaced {{convert|32500|LT|t|0|lk=on}} at standard load and {{convert|36646|LT|t|0}} at full load. High-tensile steel was used throughout the hull with mild steel used only in areas that did not contribute to structural strength. The hull was subdivided by 25 transverse watertight [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s and the engine room was divided by a longitudinal bulkhead. The [[double bottom]] was {{convert|1.275|m|sp=us}} deep while the vitals were protected by a triple bottom that added an extra {{convert|875|mm|sp=us}} of depth. The [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] as designed was {{convert|8.89|m|ftin|sp=us}} forward, {{convert|6.24|m|ftin|sp=us}} amidships and {{convert|6.49|m|ftin|sp=us}} aft. They were fitted with three Frahm anti-rolling tanks on each side to reduce their rolling motion.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 243, 249, 251</ref>

===Propulsion===
Two sets of [[steam turbine]]s were ordered on 22 April 1913 from the Franco-Russian Works for the Admiralty-built ships while the Baltic Works built its own turbines, with some components ordered from abroad. The wing propeller shafts were powered by high-pressure impulse-reaction turbines while the inboard shafts were powered by low-pressure reaction-type turbines. They produced a total of {{convert|66000|shp|kW|abbr=on|0|lk=on}} although they were designed to be forced to a total of {{convert|90000|shp|kW|0}}. 25 triangular [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s powered the turbines with a working pressure of {{convert|17|kg/cm2|kPa psi|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The forward boilers were grouped into three compartments with three oil-fired boilers each while the rear boilers were split into four compartments, each with four coal-fired boilers fitted with oil sprayers. Maximum speed was estimated at 26.5 knots, although forcing the machinery would increase it to {{convert|28.5|knots}}. The maximum coal capacity was {{convert|1974|LT|t|0}} plus {{convert|1904|LT|t|0}} of [[fuel oil]], which provided an estimated endurance of {{convert|2280|nmi|-1}} at 26.5 knots.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 244, 253<U+2013>54</ref>

The ''Borodino''-class ships had six [[turbo generator]]s and two [[diesel generator]]s, each rated at 320 kilowatts. These were divided between four compartments on the platform deck, two each forward and aft of the machinery. These powered the complex electrical system that combined [[alternating current]] for most equipment with [[direct current]] for heavy-load machinery like the turret motors.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 254, 332</ref>

===Armament===
The main armament consisted of four electrically powered turrets, each with three 52-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] {{convert|14|in|adj=on|0}} Model 1913 guns. The guns could be depressed to <U+2212>5<U+00B0> and elevated to 25<U+00B0>. They could be loaded at any angle between -5<U+00B0> and +15<U+00B0>; their rate of fire was supposed to three rounds per minute up to 15<U+00B0> of elevation. The turrets could elevate and traverse at a rate of 3 degrees per second. 80 rounds per gun were carried at full load. The guns fired {{convert|747.6|kg|adj=on|sp=us}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|731.5|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}; this provided a maximum range of {{convert|23240|m|yd|sp=us}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNRussian_14-52_mk6.htm|title=Russian 14"/52 (35.6 cm) Pattern 1913 356 mm/52 (14") Pattern 1913|date=29 August 2007 |accessdate=3 January 2010}}</ref><ref>McLaughlin, pp. 251<U+2013>52</ref>

The secondary armament consisted of twenty-four {{convert|130|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} [[130 mm/55 B7 Pattern 1913|/55 Pattern 1913 guns]] mounted in [[casemate]]s. A pair of casemates were situated on each side, below the three rear turrets, but six casemates were positioned near the forward turret, two of which were directly above the middle pair. This reflected the most likely direction of attack by [[torpedo boat]]s anticipated by the Naval General Staff.<ref name=m2>McLaughlin, p. 252</ref> Their rate of fire ranged from five to eight rounds per minute and they were provided with 200 rounds per gun. They had a maximum range of about {{convert|15364|m|yd|sp=us}} with a {{convert|36.86|kg|lb|adj=on|sp=us}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|823|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNRussian_51-55_m1913.htm|title=Russian 130 mm/55 (5.1") Pattern 1913|date=10 May 2006|accessdate=3 January 2010}}</ref>

Four 38-caliber {{convert|2.5|in|mm|adj=on}} [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]] were to be fitted on the upper deck with 220 rounds per gun, but their exact location is not known.<ref name=m2/> Their elevation limits were between +5 and +75<U+00B0>. They fired {{convert|4.04|kg|lb|adj=on|sp=us}} [[shrapnel shell]]s at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|686|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on|sp=us}}. This provided a maximum range of {{convert|6804|m|yd|sp=us}} against surface targets, but their maximum range against aerial targets was {{convert|6000|m|sp=us}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapon/WNRussian_25-38_m1916.htm |title=Russian 2.5"/38 (6.33 cm) Pattern 1916 63.3 mm/38 (2.5") Pattern 1916|date=21 May 2006|accessdate=3 January 2010}}</ref> Four {{convert|75|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} gun were mounted in pairs on the main turret roofs for subcaliber training with the main guns. Four {{convert|47|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} salute guns and {{convert|7.62|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[machine gun]]s were also carried. Six underwater {{convert|17.7|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s were mounted, three on each [[broadside]]. Eighteen torpedoes were carried for them.<ref name=m2/>

===Fire control===
The forward and aft main gun turrets were given a {{convert|6|m|ftin|adj=on|sp=us}} [[rangefinder]] and there was another {{convert|5|m|ftin|adj=on|sp=us}} unit on top of the conning tower.<ref name=m2/> These would provide data for the Geisler central artillery post to calculate and then transmit commands to the guns for the gun crew to follow.<ref>{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Norman|title=Naval Firepower: Battleship Guns and Gunnery in the Dreadnought Era|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, MD|date=2008|pages=273<U+2013>75|isbn=978-1-59114-555-4}}</ref> The exact type of mechanical fire control computer is not known for certain; it would have either been the Pollen Argo range clock, which had been bought in 1913, or the domestically designed Erikson system.<ref name=m2/>

===Protection===
The trials with the ''Chesma'' greatly affected the armor protection of the ''Borodino''-class ships. The Krupp cemented armor plates were sized to match the frames to provide support for their joints and they were joined together to better distribute the shock of a shell's impact. The {{convert|237.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[Belt armor|waterline belt]] covered the middle {{convert|151.2|m|ftin|sp=us}} of the ship. It had a total height of {{convert|5.015|m|ftin|sp=us}}, {{convert|3.375|m|ftin|sp=us}} of which was above the design waterline and {{convert|1.64|m|ftin|sp=us}} below. It was backed by 75 millimeters of wood to make a better fit between the hull and the armor. The remaining portion of the waterline was protected by {{convert|125|mm|in|adj=on}} plates backed by {{convert|50|mm|sp=us}} of wood. The upper belt was {{convert|100|mm|sp=us}} thick and had a height of {{convert|2.89|mm|sp=us}}. It thinned to 75&nbsp;mm forward of the casemates all the way to the bow. The rear portion of the forecastle deck was protected by an upwards extension of the upper belt in the area of the forward barbettes and the upper casemates. The upper casemates were also protected by 100&nbsp;mm transverse bulkheads from axial fire. Behind the side armor was an inboard longitudinal splinter bulkhead that was {{convert|50|mm|sp=us}} thick between the middle and lower decks. This decreased to {{convert|25|mm|sp=us}} between the middle and upper decks. This sloped away from the edge of the lower deck to the lower edge of the armor belt with a total thickness of 75&nbsp;mm. The slope was actually one 50&nbsp;mm plate of Krupp noncemented armor (KNC) on a 25&nbsp;mm nickel-steel plate. The forward end of the citadel was protected by other armor and the transverse bulkhead was therefore only 75&nbsp;mm thick. However, the rear bulkhead had no other protection and was {{convert|300|mm|1|sp=us}} thick between the middle and lower decks, reducing to 75&nbsp; at the level of the armor belt.<ref name=m2/>

The main gun turrets had sides 300&nbsp;mm thick with 150&nbsp;mm roofs. 50&nbsp;mm plates protected the gun ports and 25&nbsp;mm bulkheads separated each gun. The barbettes were {{convert|247.5|mm|abbr=on}} thick, but reduced to {{convert|147.5|mm|sp=us}} when behind other armor. They were shaped like truncated cones, which reduced the obliquity of descending shells and thus lessened their protective value. The conning tower was {{convert|400|mm|1|sp=us}} thick, but reduced to 300&nbsp;mm below the upper deck. The funnel uptakes were protected by 50&nbsp;mm of armor. The upper [[deck (ship)|deck]] was {{convert|37.5|mm|sp=us}} thick while the middle deck consisted of {{convert|40|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} plates of KNC on 25&nbsp;mm of nickel-steel over the armored citadel. Underwater protection was minimal as there was only a {{convert|10|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} watertight bulkhead behind the upwards extension of the double bottom and even this was squeezed out as the hull narrowed towards the end turrets.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 252<U+2013>53</ref>

==Construction==
[[File:IzmailConstruction.jpg|thumb|left|''Izmail'' on the ways in 1915]]
Though all four ships were officially laid down on 19 December 1912, work did not really begin until March<U+2013>April 1913. Delays affected construction of the ships enough that, when reviewed on 4 June 1914, launching of the first pair of ships was delayed until October 1914. When World War I began the hull of ''Izmail'', the most advanced ship, was judged 43% complete, with the others lagging considerably behind her. The war caused more delays, including problems with imported components, as the ships were competing with other production deemed necessary for the war. Three of the four were launched in 1915, but it was clear that Russian industry would not be able to complete them during the war, mostly because the turrets were seriously delayed, and they were reclassified as 2nd Rank Projects by the Main Administration of Shipbuilding in 1916.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 248<U+2013>49</ref>

A number of plans were made for the post-war completion of the ships, including modifying the turrets to load at a fixed angle of 4<U+00B0> and lengthening the funnels by {{convert|2|m|sp=us}} to minimize smoke interference with the bridge as had been a problem on the ''Gangut''-class dreadnoughts. Other ideas related to the improvement of the machinery with geared turbines, turbo-electric drive or F<U+00F6>ttinger's hydraulic transmission, but these were more theoretical than practical.<ref name=m9>McLaughlin, p. 249</ref>

The condition of the ships was assessed, as shown below, on 28 April 1917, but in some respects the situation was worse than shown as the turrets for ''Izmail'' were not expected to be completed until 1919. The Congress of Shipyard Workers decided to continue work on the ''Izmail'' in mid-1917, but only to provide jobs. The provisional government halted all work on ''Borodino'', ''Kinburn'', and ''Navarin'' on 24 October 1917 and the Soviet Supreme Naval College ordered work on ''Izmail'' halted on 14 December 1917.<ref name=m9/>

After the end of the [[Russian Civil War]] the victorious [[Bolshevik]]s considered finishing ''Izmail'' and, possibly, ''Borodino'' to their original design, although it would take at least two years to build all of ''Izmail''{{'}}s turrets, if enough guns were available. Ten had been delivered by [[Vickers Limited|Vickers]] before the Revolution and one gun had been completed domestically in 1912, but prospects were not promising that more guns could be purchased from Vickers or that the Soviets could make more given the current state of their domestic heavy industry in the wake of the Civil War. Another problem was the complicated electrical system; it could not be completed under the current conditions and at least twenty months would be required to replace it with a simpler system.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 332</ref>

They also considered finishing ''Kinburn'' and ''Navarin'' to a modified design that featured {{convert|16|in|adj=on}} guns, a double turret of which actually weighed slightly less than a triple 14-inch turret. Four proposals were made with various changes to the armor scheme, but none were accepted, not least because the prospects of actually acquiring such guns were minimal at best. Domestic industry was not capable of building such large guns and they were not able to purchase such guns from any foreign company. Other ideas were examined for the three less complete ships as well. These included converting the hulls to cargo ships, passenger liners and even {{convert|22000|LT|t|0|adj=on}} oil barges, but most of these ideas were rejected as the hulls were thought to be too large and unwieldy for such uses. None of these proposals were accepted and all three of the less complete ships were sold to a German company for [[scrap]] on 21 August 1923 to raise much need cash for the government.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 332<U+2013>35</ref>

No further proposals were made to complete ''Izmail'' as a battlecruiser, but she was almost converted into an [[aircraft carrier]]. The Operational Administration of the [[Soviet Navy]] worked out the requirements in May 1925 for such a conversion that would have made her into a 22,000-ton carrier with a top speed of {{convert|27|kn|mph km/h|0}} and a capacity of fifty aircraft. She would have been armed with eight {{convert|183|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} guns and her armor reduced to a maximum of {{convert|76|mm|sp=us}}. This proposal was approved by [[Alexey Rykov]], Chairman of the [[Council of the People's Commissars]] on 6 July 1925, but it was cancelled on 16 March 1926 after the [[Red Army]] managed to gain control of a commission appointed to review the needs of the Navy, the Army being strongly opposed to spending additional money on naval projects.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 335<U+2013>36</ref> She was scrapped beginning in 1931 in Leningrad.<ref>{{cite book|last=Breyer|first=Siegfried|title=Soviet Warship Development|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|location=London|date=1992|volume=Volume I: 1917<U+2013>1937|page=114|isbn=0-85177-604-3}}</ref>
