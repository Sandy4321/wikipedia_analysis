'''Iris''' is an American [[synthpop]]<ref name=amg/> band, formed by [[Reagan Jones]] and [[Matthew Morris (musician)|Mat Morris]] in 1993. After releasing their first album ''[[Disconnect (Iris album)|Disconnect]]'', Matthew Morris was replaced with [[Andrew Sega]], who pushed the band's sound into a more experimental electronic direction. Their latest album, ''[[Blacklight (Iris album)|Blacklight]]'' was released in September 2010.

==Biography==
[[File:Andrew1.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Andrew Sega performing with Iris, Seattle 2008]]
The band was initiated in 1993 as Forgiving Iris, with members Reagan Jones ([[Singing|vocals]]/[[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), Matt Morris (keyboards/[[Programming (music)|programming]]).<ref name=amg>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p484495|pure_url=yes}} Iris] at [[Allmusic]]</ref> The two had met in college and, influenced by 1980s artists such as [[Erasure]] and [[Depeche Mode]], began playing covers locally in [[Austin, Texas]]. In 1999 they changed their name to Iris and released their debut full-length, ''[[Disconnect (album)|Disconnect]]'', which netted them "Best Band" and "Best Album" awards at the American Synthpop Awards in 2000.<ref name=amg/> Its single, "Annie, Would I Lie To You?" was one of the best-selling records in label [[A Different Drum]]<U+2019>s history.

After several shows that followed, Reagan Jones and Matthew Morris started having arguments about their musical direction. Morris was focused on his personal life, and he wasn't interested to go back into the studio for the second album. He met [[Andrew Sega]] through the original singer of [[CTRL (band)|CTRL]] Joel Willard in 2001, and told him that Jones was looking for someone new to work with. Sega and Jones started working on some test tracks, the first of which would later become "Unknown". They felt that the chemistry between the two worked out so well that they started working on the new record that would become ''[[Awakening (Iris album)|Awakening]]''. Sega added guitars and pushed the band's sound into a more experimental electronic direction. They released their second album ''Awakening'' throughout Sega's new label, [[Diffusion Records]]. Their next record, ''[[Wrath (Iris album)|Wrath]]'' (2005) took a more aggressive approach. Its first single, "Appetite" went #1 on mainstream radio in Poland. A European tour followed, including festivals in Moscow and London.

In 2008, Iris released their first CD/DVD combo, ''[[Hydra (Iris album)|Hydra]]''. It featured 3 brand new tracks, as well as remixes from bands like [[Mesh (band)|Mesh]], [[Alpinestars (band)|Alpinestars]], [[Datguy]], [[Benz & MD]], plus a 40 minute "behind the scenes" tour diary DVD.

A new album titled ''[[Blacklight (Iris album)|Blacklight]]'' was released on September 3, 2010 on Infacted Recordings.
