The '''Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith''' is a religion founded by [[Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h]] in 19th century [[Persian Empire|Persia]]. Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s number around 6 million in more than 200 countries around the world.<ref>See [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> statistics#Worldwide figures|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> statistics]] for a breakdown of different estimates.</ref><ref name="eor">{{cite encyclopedia

According to Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> teachings, religious history is seen as an evolving educational process for mankind, through God's messengers, which are termed [[Manifestation of God|Manifestations of God]]. [[Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h]] is seen as the most recent, pivotal, but not final of these individuals. He claimed to be the expected redeemer and teacher prophesied in [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and other religions, and that his mission was to establish a firm basis for unity throughout the world, and inaugurate an age of peace and justice, which Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s expect will inevitably arise.<ref name="esslemont">{{cite book |author= Esslemont, J.E. |year= 1980 |title= Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h and the New Era |edition= 5th ed. |publisher=Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |id= ISBN 0877431604 |url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/je/BNE/}}</ref>

The term comes from the Arabic word [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> symbols#Bah.C3.A1.E2.80.99|Bah<U+00E1><U+2019>]] (<U+0628><U+0647><U+0627><U+0621>), meaning "glory" or "splendor".<ref>Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s prefer the orthographies "Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>", "Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s", "the B<U+00E1>b", "Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h", and "`Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>", using a [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> orthography|particular transcription]] of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] in publications. "Bahai", "Bahais", "Baha'i", "the Bab", "Bahaullah" and "Baha'u'llah" are often used when diacriticals are unavailable.</ref>

==Beliefs==

Three core principles of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> teachings are often referred to simply as: the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> concept of God|unity of God]], the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith and the unity of religion|unity of religion]], and the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of mankind]].<ref name="eor" /> Many Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> beliefs and practices are rooted in these priorities; but taken alone these would be an over-simplification of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> teachings.

===God===
{{main|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> concept of God}}
Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s believe in a single, imperishable [[God]], the creator of all things, including all the creatures and forces in the universe. <ref name="britannica">{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1988 | title = The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith | encyclopedia = Britannica Book of the Year | publisher = Encyclopaedia Britannica | location = Chicago | id = ISBN 0852294867}}</ref>  The existence of God is thought to be eternal, without a beginning or end,<ref name="britannica" /> and is described as "a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty." <ref>{{cite book|first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA
 |id=ISBN 0877430209 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-9.html#gr26 | pages= pp.139}}</ref>  Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of his creation, with a will and purpose.  Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s believe that God expresses this will in many ways, including through a series of divine messengers referred to as [[Manifestation of God|Manifestations of God]] or sometimes ''divine educators''.<ref name="eor" /> In expressing God's intent, these manifestations are seen to establish religion in the world.  

Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> teachings state that God is too great for humans to fully comprehend, or to create a complete and accurate image.<ref name="manifestation">{{cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = | year = 1982 | title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Writings | journal = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Studies | volume = monograph 9  | pages = pp. 1-38 | url = http://bahai-library.org/articles/manifestation.html}}</ref>  In the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> religion God is often referred to by titles (e.g. the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on [[monotheism]], rejecting such doctrines as the [[Trinity]].<ref>{{cite journal | title = Jesus Christ in the Baha'i Writings | first = Robert | last = Stockman | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume= 2 | issue = 1 | number = 1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=`Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> |authorlink=`Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> |year=1990 |title=Some Answered Questions |page=113 |edition=Softcover |publisher=Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |id=ISBN 0-87743-162-0 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-27.html#pg113}}</ref>

===Religion===
[[Image:Wilmette how side.jpg|199px|thumb|Symbols of many religions on the pillar of the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> House of Worship]] in Wilmette, Illinois]]
{{main|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith and the unity of religion}}
Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> notions of progressive religious revelation result in their accepting the validity of most of the worlds' religions, whose founders and central figures are seen as Manifestations of God.  These include, but are not limited to [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]], [[Moses]], and [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s also believe that other religious figures, such as [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], [[Noah]], and [[Hud (prophet)|H<U+00FA>d]] historically existed and were prophets of God.  Religious history is interpreted as a series of [[dispensationalism|dispensations]], where each ''manifestation'' brings a somewhat broader and more advanced [[revelation]], suited for the time and place in which it was expressed.<ref name="britannica" />  Specific religious social teachings (e.g. the direction of prayer, or dietary restrictions) may be revoked by a subsequent manifestation so that a more appropriate requirement for the time and place may be established.  Conversely, certain general principles (e.g. neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal and consistent. Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s do not believe that this process of progressive revelation will end.  They do, however, believe that it is cyclical.  Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s do not expect a new manifestation of god to appear prior to 1000 years after Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's revelation.<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael D. |last=McMullen |year=2000 |title=The Baha'i: The Religious Construction of a Global Identity |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=Atlanta, Georgia |id= ISBN 0813528364 |pages= pp. 7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=`Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> |authorlink=`Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> |year=1978 |title=Selections From the Writings of `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> |edition=Hardcover |publisher=Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |id=ISBN 0853980810 |pages=pp. 67|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAB/sab-34-printable.html}}</ref>

Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> beliefs are sometimes described as [[Syncretism|syncretic]] combinations of earlier religions' beliefs.  Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s, however, assert that their religion is a distinct tradition with its own scriptures, teachings, laws, and history.<ref name="britannica" />  Its cultural and religious debt to the [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a Islamic]] matrix in which it was founded is seen as analogous to the Jewish socio-religious context in which Christianity was established.  Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s describe their faith as an independent world religion, differing from the other traditions only in its relative newness and in the appropriateness of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's teachings to the modern context.  Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h is believed to fulfill the [[Messianic prophecy|messianic expectations]] of these precursor faiths.

===Human beings===
[[Image:Ringstone.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> symbols#Ringstone Symbol|Ringstone symbol]] represents humanity's connection to God]]
{{main|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith and the unity of humanity}}
Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s believe that human beings have a "rational [[soul]]", and that this provides the species with a unique capacity to recognize God's station and humanity's relationship with its creator.  Every human is seen to have a duty to recognize God and his manifestations, and to conform to their teachings.<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael D. |last=McMullen |year=2000 |title=The Baha'i: The Religious Construction of a Global Identity |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=Atlanta, Georgia |id= ISBN 0813528364 |pages= pp. 57-58}}</ref> Through recognition and obedience, service to fellow humans and regular prayer and spiritual practice, Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s believe that the soul becomes closer to God, the spiritual ideal in Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> belief.  When a human dies, the soul passes into the next world, where its spiritual development in the physical world becomes a basis for judgment and advancement in the spiritual world.<ref name="lafd">{{cite book | title = Life After Death: A study of the afterlife in world religions | last = Masumian | first = Farnaz | publisher = Oneworld Publications | location = Oxford | year = 1995 | id = ISBN 1-85168-074-8}}</ref> Heaven and Hell are taught to be spiritual states of nearness or distance from God that describe relationships in this world and the next, and not physical places of reward and punishment achieved after death.<ref name="lafd" />

The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> writings emphasize the essential equality of human beings, and the abolition of prejudice.  Humanity is seen as essentially one, though highly varied; its diversity of race and culture are seen as worthy of appreciation and tolerance.<ref name="eor" />  Doctrines of racism, nationalism, caste, and social class are seen as artificial impediments to unity.<ref name="eor" />  The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> teachings state that the unification of mankind is the paramount issue in the religious and political conditions of the present world.<ref name="britannica" />

From its origins in the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Empires, the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith acquired a number of [[Western world|Western]] converts by [[World War I]]. Fifty years later its population was distributed much more towards the [[Third World]] as a result of [[Pioneering (Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>)|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> pioneering]] efforts.  

According to ''The World Almanac and Book of Facts 2004'':
{{cquote|The majority of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s live in Asia (3.6 million), Africa (1.8 million), and Latin America (900,000).  According to some estimates, the largest Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> community in the world is in [[India]], with 2.2 million Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s, next is [[Iran]], with 350,000, and the [[United States|USA]], with 150,000. Aside from these countries, numbers vary greatly. Currently, no country has a Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> majority. [[Guyana]] is the country with the largest percentage of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s (7%).}}

The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> religion was listed in ''The Britannica Book of the Year'' (1992&ndash;present) as the second most widespread of the world's independent religions in terms of the number of countries represented. Britannica claims that it is established in 247 countries and territories; represents over 2,100 ethnic, racial, and tribal groups; has scriptures translated into over 800 languages; and has seven million adherents worldwide [2005].<ref name="brittanica_stats" />

===Summary===
[[Shoghi Effendi]], the appointed head of the religion from 1921 to 1957, wrote the following summary of what he considered to be the distinguishing principles of [[Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h]]'s teachings, which, he said, together with the laws and ordinances of the ''[[Kit<U+00E1>b-i-Aqdas]]'' constitute the bed-rock of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith:
{{cquote|The independent search after truth, unfettered by [[superstition]] or [[tradition]]; the oneness of the entire [[Human|human race]], the pivotal principle and fundamental doctrine of the Faith; the basic unity of all religions; the condemnation of all forms of [[prejudice]], whether religious, racial, class or national; the harmony which must exist between [[religion]] and [[science]]; the equality of men and women, the two wings on which the bird of human kind is able to soar; the introduction of compulsory education; the adoption of a [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith and Language Policy|universal auxiliary language]]; the abolition of the extremes of wealth and poverty; the institution of a [[World government|world tribunal]] for the adjudication of disputes between nations; the exaltation of work, performed in the spirit of service, to the rank of [[worship]]; the glorification of justice as the ruling principle in human society, and of religion as a bulwark for the protection of all peoples and nations; and the establishment of a permanent and [[World peace|universal peace]] as the supreme goal of all mankind<U+2014>these stand out as the essential elements [which Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h proclaimed].<ref>{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |id=ISBN 0877430209 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-20.html#gr7 | pages=pp. 281}}</ref>}}

===Mystical teachings===
Although it concentrates on social and ethical issues as well, some of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith's foundational texts might be described as mystical.<ref name="britannica" /> Shoghi Effendi has called the ''[[Seven Valleys]]'' Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's "greatest mystical composition." It was written to a follower of [[Sufism]], a mystic and esoterical tradition of Islam.<ref name="rob1">{{cite book  |author= Taherzadeh, Adib |year= 1976 |title= The Revelation of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h, Volume 1: Baghdad 1853-63 |publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |id= ISBN 0853982708 | pages = pp. 96-99}}</ref> It was first translated into English in 1906, becoming one of the earliest available books of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h to the [[Western world|West]]. The ''[[Hidden Words]]'' is another book written by Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h during the same period, containing 153 short passages described by `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> as "a treasury of divine mysteries".

===The Covenant===
{{main|Covenant of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h}}
Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s have high regard for what is termed the "Greater Covenant", which they see as universal in nature, and from "time immemorial" has been carried through by the [[Manifestation of God|Manifestations of God]] of all ages.<ref>{{cite book |last= Taherzadeh |first= Adib |year= 1972 |title= The Covenant of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h |publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |id= ISBN 0853983445}}</ref> They also regard highly the "Lesser Covenant", which is viewed as an agreement between a Messenger of God and his followers, unique to each revelation, and includes social practices and the continuation of authority in the religion.<ref name="momen_covenant">{{cite web | title = Covenant, The, and Covenant-breaker | last = Momen | first = Moojan | accessdate = 2006-06-14 | url = http://bahai-library.com/?file=momen_encyclopedia_covenant#3.%20The%20Lesser%20Covenant }}</ref> At this time Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s view Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's revelation as a binding lesser covenant for his followers; in the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> writings being firm in the covenant is considered as one of the main religious virtues a person can work toward.<ref name="momen_covenant" />

With unity as an essential teaching of the religion, Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s follow an [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> administration|administration]] that they believe is divinely ordained, and therefore see attempts to create schisms and divisions as insignificant, doomed efforts which are contrary to the teachings of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h.

{{main|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> history}}

Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> history is often traced through a sequence of leaders, beginning with the [[B<U+00E1>b]]'s May 23, 1844 declaration in Shiraz, and ultimately resting on an administrative order established by the central figures of the religion. The tradition was mostly isolated to the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires until after the death of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h in 1892, at which time he had followers in thirteen countries of Asia and Africa.<ref name="rob4">{{cite book |author= Taherzadeh, Adib |year= 1987 |title= The Revelation of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h, Volume 4: Mazra'ih & Bahji 1877-92 |pages=125 |publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford, UK |id= ISBN 0853982708}}</ref> Under the leadership of his son, `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>, the religion gained a footing in Europe and America, and was consolidated in Iran, where it still suffered intense [[Persecution of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s|persecution]].<ref name="affolter">{{cite journal | last = Affolter | first = Friedrich W.  | year = 2005 | month = Jan. | title = The Specter of Ideological Genocide: The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s of Iran | journal = War Crimes, Genocide, & Crimes against Humanity | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = pp. 75-114 | url =http://www.aa.psu.edu/journals/war-crimes/v1n1a3.pdf| accessdate = 2006-05-31}}</ref> After the death of `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> in 1921, the leadership of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> community entered a new phase, evolving from that of a single individual to an administrative order with a system of both elected bodies and appointed individuals.

===The B<U+00E1>b===
{{main|B<U+00E1>b}}
In 1844 Siyyid `Al<U+00ED>-Muhammad of [[Shiraz, Iran]] proclaimed that he was "the B<U+00E1>b" ({{ArB|<U+0627><U+0644><U+0628><U+0627><U+0628>}} "the Gate"), after a [[Shi'a Islam|Shi`a]] religious concept.<ref name="affolter" /> His followers were therefore known as [[B<U+00E1>bism|B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s]]. As the B<U+00E1>b's teachings spread, which the Islamic clergy saw as a threat, B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s came under increased persecution, at times being forced to choose between renouncing their beliefs or being killed.<ref name="britannica" /> Several military confrontations took place between government and B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED> forces.

Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s see the B<U+00E1>b as the forerunner of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith, because the B<U+00E1>b's writings introduced the concept of "[[He whom God shall make manifest]]", a Messianic figure whose coming, according to Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s, was announced in the scriptures of all of the world's great religions, and whom Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h, the founder of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith, claimed to be in 1863.<ref name="britannica" />  [[Shrine of the B<U+00E1>b|The B<U+00E1>b's tomb]] is located in [[Haifa|Haifa, Israel]], and is an important place of [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] for Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s.

M<U+00ED>rz<U+00E1> Husayn `Al<U+00ED> of N<U+00FA>r was one of the early followers of the B<U+00E1>b, who later took the title of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h. He was arrested and imprisoned for this involvement in 1852. He claimed that while incarcerated in the dungeon of the [[S<U+00ED>y<U+00E1>h-Ch<U+00E1>l]] in [[Tehran]], he received the first intimations that he was the one anticipated by the B<U+00E1>b.<ref name="eor" /> He announced this in 1863.

Shortly thereafter he was expelled from [[Persian Empire|Persia]] to [[Baghdad]],<ref name="eor" /> in the [[Ottoman Empire]]; then to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]; then to [[Edirne|Adrianople]]. During this time tensions grew between Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h and [[Subh-i-Azal]], the appointed leader of the B<U+00E1>b<U+00ED>s, culminating in Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's 1866 declaration.<ref name="iranica">{{cite encyclopedia
 |encyclopedia= Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Baha'-allah}}</ref> While in Adrianople, he wrote letters to several rulers of the world, including Sultan [[Abd<U+00FC>l<U+00E2>ziz]], declaring his mission as a Messenger of God. As a result Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h was banished a final time, to the penal colony of [[Acre, Israel|`Akk<U+00E1>]], in present-day [[Israel]].<ref name="iranica" />

Towards the end of his life, the strict and harsh confinement was gradually relaxed, and he was allowed to live in a home near `Akk<U+00E1>, while still officially a prisoner of that city.<ref name="iranica" /> He died there in 1892. Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s regard his resting place at [[Mansion of Bahj<U+00ED>|Bahj<U+00ED>]] as the [[Qiblih]] to which they turn in prayer each day.  During his lifetime, Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h left a large volume of writings; the ''[[Kit<U+00E1>b-i-Aqdas]]'', and the [[Kit<U+00E1>b-i-<U+00CD>q<U+00E1>n|Book of Certitude]] are recognized as primary Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> theological works, and the [[Hidden Words]] and the [[Seven Valleys]] as primary mystical treatises.

`Abb<U+00E1>s Effendi was Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's eldest son, known by the title of `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> (Servant of Bah<U+00E1>). His father left a [[Tablets of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h#Kit<U+00E1>b-i-`Ahd (Book of the Covenant)|Will]] that appointed `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> as the leader of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> community, and designated him as the "Centre of the Covenant", "Head of the Faith", and the sole authoritative interpreter of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's writings.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h |authorlink=Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h |origyear=1873-92 |year=1994 |title=Tablets of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h Revealed After the Kit<U+00E1>b-i-Aqdas |publisher=Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |id=ISBN 0877431744 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/ |pages=pp.217}}</ref><ref name="balyuzi" />

`Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> had shared his father's long exile and imprisonment, which continued until `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>'s own release as a result of the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908.

Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's ''[[Kit<U+00E1>b-i-Aqdas]]'' and ''The [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>]]'' are foundation documents of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> administrative order. Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h established the elected [[Universal House of Justice]], and `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> established the appointed hereditary Guardianship and clarified the relationship between the two institutions.<ref name="balyuzi"/> In his Will, `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> appointed his eldest grandson, [[Shoghi Effendi]], as the first Guardian of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith.<ref name="esslemont" />

Shoghi Effendi throughout his lifetime translated [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> literature]]; developed global plans for the expansion of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> community; developed the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> World Centre]]; carried on a voluminous correspondence with communities and individuals around the world; and built the administrative structure of the religion, preparing the community for the election of the Universal House of Justice.<ref name="eor" /> He died in 1957 under conditions that didn't allow for a successor to be appointed.

At local, regional, and national levels, Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s elect members to nine-person [[Spiritual Assembly|Spiritual Assemblies]], which run the affairs of the religion.<ref name="britannica" /> There are also [[Institution of the Counsellors|appointed individuals]] working at various levels, including locally and internationally which perform the function of propagating the faith and protecting the community.<ref name="britannica" /> The latter do not serve as [[clergy]], which the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith does not have.<ref name="britannica" />

The Universal House of Justice, first elected in 1963, remains the supreme governing body of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith, and its 9 members are elected every five years by the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies.<ref>{{cite book | chapter = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith: A portraint | first = Robert | last = Stockman | title = A SourceBook for Earth's Community of Religions | editor = Joel Beversluis (ed) | location = Grand Rapids, MI | publisher = CoNexus Press | year = 1995}}</ref> Any male Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>, 21 years or older, is eligible to be elected to the Universal House of Justice; all other positions are open to male and female Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s.

==Involvement in society==

===Work===
[[Monasticism]] is forbidden, and Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s attempt to ground their spirituality in ordinary daily life. Performing useful work, for example, is not only required but considered a form of worship.<ref name="britannica" />  Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h prohibited a [[Mendicancy|mendicant]] and [[Asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle,<ref name="britannica" /> encouraging Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s to "Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in."<ref>{{cite book |author= Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h |authorlink=Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h |year=1991 |title=Proclamation of Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h |publisher=Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |id=ISBN 0877430640 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/PB/pb-61.html#gr1 |pages=pp. 122}}</ref> The importance of self-exertion and service to humanity in man's spiritual life is emphasised further in Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's writings, where he states that work done in the spirit of service to humanity enjoys a rank equal to that of prayer and worship in the sight of God.<ref name="britannica" />

===United Nations===
Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h wrote of the need for [[world government]] in this age of humanity's collective life. Because of this emphasis many Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s have chosen to support efforts of improving [[international relations]] through organizations such as the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]]. The [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> International Community]] is an agency under the direction of the Universal House of Justice in Haifa, and has consultative status with the following organizations:<ref name="bic">{{cite web | title = History of Active Cooperation with the United Nations| author = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> International Community | publisher = bahai.org | url = http://statements.bahai.org/about.cfm | date = 2006 | accessdate = 2006-06-15}}</ref>

In 1939 [[Shoghi Effendi]] launched a seven year plan, followed by another in 1946.<ref>{{cite book | title=Studying the Writings of Shoghi Effendi | chapter = The Life of Shoghi Effendi | first = Helen | last = Danesh | coauthors = Danesh, John; Danesh, Amelia | = location = Oxford | publisher = George Ronald | year = 1991 | id = ISBN 0853983364 | editor = M. Bergsmo (Ed.)}}</ref> In 1953 he launched the [[Ten Year Crusade|Ten Year World Crusade]], with extremely ambitious goals for the expansion of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> communities and institutions, the translation of [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> literature]] into several new languages, and the sending of [[Pioneering (Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>)|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> pioneers]] into previously unreached nations.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Journal of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Studies | title= Baha'i History in the Formative Age | first = Graham | last= Hassal | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | year = 1996 | pages=pp.1-21}}</ref> He announced in letters during the Ten Year Crusade that it would be followed by other plans under the direction of the Universal House of Justice, which was elected in 1963 at the culmination of the Crusade. The House of Justice then launched a nine year plan in 1964, and a series of subsequent multi-year plans of varying length and goals followed, guiding the direction of the international Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> community.<ref>{{cite journal |title= The Baha'i Faith 1957-1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments | first = Moojan | last = Momen | coauthors = Smith, Peter | year = 1989 |  url = http://bahai-library.com/?file=momen_smith_developments_1957-1988.html |volume = 19 | journal = Religion | pages=pp. 63-91}}</ref>

===Current international plan===
Since the late 1990's, the House of Justice has been directing communities to prepare for large-scale expansion, organizing localities into "clusters", creating new institutions such as [[Spiritual Assembly|Regional Councils]] and strengthening the various "training institutes". <ref name="uhj_letter_2003">{{cite web | author = Universal House of Justice | title = 17 January 2003 letter | date=2003-01-17  | accessdate = 2006-06-15 | publisher= bahai-library.org | url = http://bahai-library.com/published.uhj/jan17.html}}</ref> The recently completed five-year plan (2001-2006) focused on developing institutions and creating the means to "sustain large-scale expansion and consolidation" (Rid&#803;v<U+00E1>n 158). Since 2001, the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s around the world have been specifically encouraged to focus on children's classes, devotional gatherings, and a systematic study of the religion, known as [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> study circle|study circles]].<ref name="uhj_letter_2003" /> A new focus was added in December 2005 with the addition of "[http://www.ruhiresources.org/index.php?src=gendocs&link=Junior%20Youth&category=Main junior youth]" classes to the core activities, focusing on education for those between 11 and 14.<ref name="second_five">{{cite book | title = Five Year Plan 2006-2011 | author = Universal House Of Justice | publisher = Palabra Publications | year = 2006  | location = West Palm Beach, Florida}}</ref>

The second five-year plan (2006-2011) was launched by the [[Universal House of Justice]] in April of 2006; it calls upon the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s of the world to establish advanced patterns of growth and community development in over 1,500 "clusters" around the world.<ref name="second_five" /> It also alludes to a possible tier-election process for [[Spiritual Assembly|Local Spiritual Assemblies]] in localities with many Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s. The years from 2001 until 2021 represent four successive five-year plans, culminating in the centennial anniversary of the passing of [[`Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>]].<ref name="second_five" />

===Study circles===
{{main|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> study circle}}
Along with a focus on consolidation has come a systematic approach to education and community development. The "study circles" are intended to be sustainable and self-perpetuating on a large scale. Participants complete a sequence of workbooks in small groups, facilitated by a tutor, and upon completion of the sequence a participant can then go on to facilitate study circles for others.

The most popular study program is the [[Ruhi Institute]], a study course originally designed for use in [[Colombia]], but which has received wide use. The first book studies three themes: the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> literature|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> writings]], [[prayer]], and [[Afterlife|life and death]]. Subsequent themes include the education of children, the lives of the B<U+00E1>b and Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h, service, and others.

==Social practices==

===Laws===
{{main|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> laws}}
The laws of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith primarily come from the ''[[Kit<U+00E1>b-i-Aqdas]]'', written by Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h. The following are a few examples of basic laws and religious observances,

*Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s over the age of 15 recite an [[Obligatory Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Prayers|obligatory prayer]] each day. There are three such prayers among which one can be chosen each day.
*Backbiting and gossip are prohibited and denounced.
*Adult Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s in good health observe a [[Nineteen Day Fast|nineteen-day sunrise-to-sunset fast]] each year from March 2 through March 20.
*Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s are forbidden to drink [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] or to take drugs, unless prescribed by doctors.
*Sexual relationships are permitted only between a husband and wife, and thus [[homosexuality|homosexual]] acts are not permitted. See [[Homosexuality and Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith]].
*[[Gambling]] is strictly forbidden.

The year consists of 19 months of 19 days, with four or five [[Ayy<U+00E1>m-i-H<U+00E1>|intercalary days]], to make a full solar year.<ref name="eor" /> The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> New Year corresponds to the traditional Persian New Year, called [[Norouz|Naw R<U+00FA>z]], and occurs on the vernal equinox, [[March 21]], at the end of the month of fasting. Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> communities gather at the beginning of each month at a meeting called a [[Nineteen Day Feast|Feast]] for worship, consultation and socializing.<ref name="britannica" />

Each of the 19 months is given a name which is an attribute of God; some examples include Bah<U+00E1><U+2019> (Splendour), <U+2018>Ilm (Knowledge), and Jam<U+00E1>l (Beauty).<ref name="esslemont" />The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> week is familiar in that it consists of seven days, with each day of the week also named after an attribute of God; some examples include Istiql<U+00E1>l (Independence), Kam<U+00E1>l (Perfection) and <U+2018>Id<U+00E1>l (Justice).  Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s observe 11 [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> calendar|Holy Days]] throughout the year, with work suspended on 9 of these. These days commemorate important anniversaries in the history of the religion.

==Persecution==
{{main|Persecution of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s}}
{{current|section}}
Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s continue to be persecuted in [[Islamist]] ruled countries, especially [[Iran]], where over 200 believers were executed between 1978 and 1998. On [[December 16]], [[2006]], the Supreme Administrative Council of Egypt made a ruling against the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s stating that the government may not recognize the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith in official identification numbers.<ref name="eipr2">{{cite web | title =  Government Must Find Solution for Baha'i Egyptians | date = 2006-12-16 | accessdate = 2006-12-16 | author = Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights | publisher = eipr.org | url = http://www.eipr.org/en/press/06/1612.htm}}</ref> The ruling leaves Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s unable to obtain the necessary government documents to have rights in their country; they cannot obtain ID cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, passports; they also cannot be employed, educated, treated in hospitals or vote among other things.<ref name="eipr2" />  The EIPR stated that the press release issued by the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court did not respond to any of the evidence and legal argumented presented by the EIPR in the case, and that instead the press release only discussed the tenets and beliefs of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith, which should have had no effect on the decision of the court.<ref name="eipr2" />

Since the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]] of 1979, Iranian Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s have regularly had their homes ransacked or been banned from attending university or holding government jobs, and several hundred have received prison sentences for their religious beliefs, most recently for participating in [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> study circle|study circles]].<ref name="fdih1">{{cite web | date = 2003-08-01 | title = Discrimination against religious minorities in Iran | author = International Federation for Human Rights | publisher = fdih.org | accessdate = 2006-10-20 | url = http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf}}</ref> Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> cemeteries have been desecrated and property seized and occasionally demolished, including the House of M<U+00ED>rz<U+00E1> Buzurg, Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h's father.<ref name="affolter" /> The House of the B<U+00E1>b in [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]] has been destroyed twice, and is one of three sites to which Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s perform [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> pilgrimage|pilgrimage]]. <ref name="affolter" /><ref>{{cite web | author = Netherlands Institute of Human Rights | publisher = Netherlands Institute of Human Rights |title = Iran, Islamic Republic of | date =2006-03-08  | accessdate = 2006-05-31 | url = http://sim.law.uu.nl/SIM/CaseLaw/uncom.nsf/0/e7b8824bdd987268c1256fa8004a8753?OpenDocument}}

Even more recently the situation of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s has worsened; the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] revealed an October 2005 confidential letter from Command Headquarters of the Armed Forces of Iran to identify Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s and to monitor their activities <ref name="unhchr">{{cite web | author = Asma Jahangir | publisher = United Nations |title = Special Rapporteur on Freedom of religion or belief concerned about treatment of followers of Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith in Iran | date =2006-03-20 | accessdate = 2006-06-01 | url = http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/5E72D6B7B624AABBC125713700572D09?opendocument}}

Due to these actions, the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights stated on [[March 20]], [[2006]] that she "also expresses concern that the information gained as a result of such monitoring will be used as a basis for the increased persecution of, and discrimination against, members of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> faith, in violation of international standards. ... The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this latest development indicates that the situation with regard to religious minorities in Iran is, in fact, deteriorating."<ref name="unhchr" />

=== Reactions ===

[[Bernard Lewis]] states that the Muslim laity and Islamic authorities have always had great difficulty in accommodating post-Islamic monotheistic religions such as the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith, since on one hand the followers of such religions cannot be dismissed either as benighted heathens, like the polytheists of Asia and the animists of Africa, nor as outdated precursors, like the Jews and Christians. Moreover, their very existence presents a challenge to the Islamic doctrine of the perfection and finality of Muhammad's revelation. <ref> Lewis (1984) p.21 </ref>
