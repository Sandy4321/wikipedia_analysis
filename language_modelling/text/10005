'''Yellowstone National Park''' is the centerpiece of the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem]], the largest intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone.<ref name="ecosystem">{{cite web| last=Schullery | first=Paul |

The park is known for its [[wildlife]] and [[Geothermal areas of Yellowstone|geothermal features]]; [[Old Faithful Geyser]] is one of the most popular features in the park.

More than 1,000 sites of historical significance have been discovered.  [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years.  The region was bypassed during the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] in the early 1800s. Aside from visits by [[mountain man|mountain men]] during the next early to mid-1800s, organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. The [[U.S. Army]] was commissioned to oversee the park just after its establishment. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the [[National Park Service]], which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance.

Yellowstone National Park spans an area of 3,472 square miles (8,987&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), comprising lakes, canyons, rivers and [[mountain range]]s.<ref name="facts"/> [[Yellowstone Lake]] is the largest high-altitude lake in [[North America]] and is centered over the [[Yellowstone Caldera]], the largest [[supervolcano]] on the continent. The caldera is considered an active volcano; it has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years. Half the world's geothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism.<ref name="geothermal">{{cite web| title =Geothermal Features and How They Work| publisher = National Park Service| date = February 17, 2007| url =http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/geothermal.htm| accessdate = 2007-04-08}}</ref> [[Lava]] flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone.

Hundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles have been documented, including several that are either [[endangered species|endangered]] or [[threatened species|threatened]].<ref name="facts"/> The vast forests and grasslands also include unique species of plants. Common animals in the park include [[grizzly bear|grizzlies]], [[gray wolf|wolves]], and free-ranging herds of [[American Bison|bison]] and [[Elk (Cervus canadensis)|elk]].  [[Forest fire]]s occur in the park each year; in the [[Yellowstone Fire of 1988|large forest fires]] of 1988, nearly one third of the park burned. Yellowstone has numerous recreational opportunities, including [[hiking]], [[camping]], [[boating]], [[fishing]] and sightseeing. Paved roads provide close access to the major geothermal areas as well as some of the lakes and waterfalls. During the winter, visitors often access the park by way of guided tours that use either [[snow coach]]es or [[snowmobile]].  

==Early history==
[[Image:Yellowstone - Lower Falls edit1.JPG|right|thumb|Lower Yellowstone Falls where the Yellowstone River plunges into the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone]]
The park is located at the headwaters of the [[Yellowstone River]], from which it takes its name. In the Eighteenth century, [[France|French]] [[Animal trapping|trappers]] named the river "Roche Jaune," which is probably a translation of the [[Mandan|Minnetaree]] name "''Mi tsi a-da-zi''" (Rock Yellow River). Later, American trappers rendered the French name in English as "Yellow Stone." Although it is commonly believed that the river was named for the yellow rocks seen in the [[Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone]], the Native American name source is not clear.<ref name="naming">{{cite web | title = The Origin of the Name <U+201C>Yellowstone<U+201D>| work = Yellowstone A Brief History of the Park | publisher = U.S. Department of the Interior|date=February 2006| url = http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/upload/Yell257.pdf|format=PDF

The human history of the park begins at least 11,000 [[year]]s ago when [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] first began to [[hunt]] and [[Fishing|fish]] in the region.  During the construction of the post office in [[Gardiner, Montana]] in the 1950s, an obsidian projectile point of [[Clovis culture|Clovis]] origin was found that dated from approximately 11,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite book |title=Homeland: An archaeologist's view of Yellowstone Country's past |author=Lahren, Larry |publisher=Cayuse Press |date=2006 |pages=p. 161 |id=ISBN 0978925106}}</ref>  These [[Paleo-indians]], of the Clovis culture, used the significant amounts of [[obsidian]] found in the park to make such [[cutting tool]]s and [[weapon]]s.  [[Arrowhead]]s made of Yellowstone [[obsidian]] have been found as far away as the [[Mississippi Valley]], indicating that a regular obsidian [[trade]] existed between local tribes and tribes farther east.<ref name="Janetski">{{cite book| last = Janetski| first = Joel C. | title = Indians in Yellowstone National Park| publisher = University of Utah Press | date = 1987| location = Salt Lake City, Utah| id = ISBN 0-87480-724-7}}</ref> By the time [[White people|white]] [[Exploration|explorers]] first entered the region during the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] in 1805, they encountered the [[Nez Perce]], [[Crow Indians|Crow]] and [[Shoshone]] tribes. While passing through present day Montana, the expedition members were informed of the Yellowstone region to the south, but did not investigate it.<ref name="Janetski"/>

In 1806, [[John Colter]], a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, left to join a group of fur trappers. After splitting up with the other trappers in 1807, Colter passed through a portion of what later became the park, during the winter of 1807<U+2013>1808. He observed at least one [[Geothermal (geology)|geothermal]] area in the northeastern section of the park, near [[Tower Falls]].<ref name="Haines">{{cite web| last = Haines| first = Aubrey L.| title = The Lewis and Clark Era (1805<U+2013>1814)| work = Yellowstone National Park: Its Exploration and Establishment | publisher = U.S. Department of the Interior| url = http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee1a.htm| date = 2000|accessdate = 2006-11-14}}</ref> After surviving wounds he suffered in a battle with members of the Crow and [[Blackfoot]] [[tribes]] in 1809, he gave a description of a place of "fire and brimstone" that was dismissed by most people as delirium. The supposedly imaginary place was nicknamed "[[Colter's Hell]]." Over the next forty years, numerous reports from [[Mountain man|mountain men]] and trappers told of boiling mud, steaming rivers and [[Petrifaction|petrified]] trees, yet most of these reports were believed at the time to be  myth.<ref name="Haines2">{{cite web| last = Haines| first = Aubrey L.| title = The Fur Trade Era (1818<U+2013>42)| work = Yellowstone National Park: Its Exploration and Establishment | publisher = U.S. Department of the Interior| date = 2000| url = http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee1b.htm| accessdate = 2006-11-15}}</ref>  
[[Image:Yellow Stone - Heisse Quelle 1.JPG|right|thumb|Mammoth Hot Springs]]
After an 1856 exploration, mountain man [[Jim Bridger]] reported observing boiling springs, spouting water, and a mountain of glass and yellow rock. These reports were largely ignored because Bridger was known for being a "spinner of yarns". His stories did arouse the interest of explorer and geologist [[Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden]], who, in 1859, started a two-year survey of the upper [[Missouri River]] region. Bridger and [[United States Army]] surveyor W.F. Raynolds acted as guides. After exploring the [[Black Hills]] region in what is now the state of [[South Dakota]], the party neared the Yellowstone River, but heavy snows forced them to turn back. The [[American Civil War]] hampered further organized explorations until the late 1860s.<ref name="Haines3">{{cite web| last = Haines| first = Aubrey L.| title = The Exploring Era (1851<U+2013>63)| work = Yellowstone National Park: Its Exploration and Establishment | publisher = U.S. Department of the Interior| date = 1975| url = http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee1c.htm| accessdate = 2006-11-14}}</ref>  

The first detailed expedition to the Yellowstone area was the [[Folsom Expedition]] of 1869, which consisted of three privately funded explorers. The Folsom party followed the Yellowstone River to [[Yellowstone Lake]].<ref name="Haines4">{{cite web| last = Haines| first = Aubrey L.| title = The Folsom Party (1869)| work = Yellowstone National Park: Its Exploration and Establishment | publisher = U.S. Department of the Interior| date = 2000| url = http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee2b.htm| accessdate = 2006-11-15}}</ref> The members of the Folsom party kept a journal and based on the information it reported, a party of Montana residents organized the [[Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition]] in 1870. It was headed by the surveyor-general of Montana [[Henry Washburn]], and included [[Nathaniel P. Langford]] (who would later become known as "National Park" Langford) and a U.S. Army detachment commanded by Lt. Gustavus Doane. The expedition spent about a month exploring the region, collecting specimens, and naming sites of interest. A Montana writer and lawyer named Cornelius Hedges, who had been a member of the Washburn expedition, proposed that the region should be set aside and protected as a National Park; he wrote a number of detailed articles about his observations for the Helena Herald newspaper between 1870<U+2013>1871. Hedges essentially restated comments made in October of 1865 by acting Montana Territorial Governor [[Thomas Francis Meagher]], who had previously commented that the region should be protected.<ref name="Haines5">{{cite web| last = Haines| first = Aubrey L.| title = Cornelius Hedges| work = Yellowstone National Park: Its Exploration and Establishment | publisher = U.S. Department of the Interior| date = 2000| url = http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee4a.htm#hedges| accessdate = 2006-11-15}}</ref> Others made similar suggestions. In a 1871 letter from [[Jay Cooke]] to Ferdinand Hayden, Cooke wrote that his friend, Senator [[William D. Kelley]] had also suggested "Congress pass a bill reserving the Great Geyser Basin as a public park forever".<ref name="Cooke">{{cite web| last = | first = | title = The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone| work = American Studies at the University of Virginia| publisher = University of Virginia| date = | url = http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA96/RAILROAD/ystone.html| accessdate = 2007-05-16}}</ref>

==Park creation and later history==
[[Image:Hayden Survey by W.H.Jackson.jpg|right|thumb|In this painting by [[William Henry Jackson]], the [[Hayden Survey]] is depicted exploring a lake in Yellowstone, 1871]]
In 1871, eleven years after his failed first effort, F.V. Hayden was finally able to make another attempt to explore the region. Now government sponsored, Hayden returned to Yellowstone with a second, larger expedition. He compiled a comprehensive report on Yellowstone, which included large-format photographs by [[William Henry Jackson]], as well as paintings by [[Thomas Moran]]. His report helped to convince the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] to withdraw this region from public auction; on [[March 1]], [[1872]], President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] signed a bill into law that created Yellowstone National Park.<ref name="grant">{{cite web| last = | first = | title = History & Culture| work = General Grant National Memorial | publisher = National Park Service| date = July 25, 2006 | url =http://www.nps.gov/gegr/historyculture/index.htm| accessdate = 2007-04-23}}</ref>

Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872. He served for five years; however he was denied a salary, funding, or staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection.  This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. As a result, Langford was forced to step down in 1877.<ref name="langford">{{cite web| last = | first = | title = Yellowstone National Park's First 130 Years|work = Yellowstone History| publisher = National Park Service| url = http://windowsintowonderland.org/history/army&nps/page3.htm| accessdate = 2007-02-28}}</ref><ref name="norris">{{cite web| last = Rydell| first =Kiki Leigh| coauthors =Mary Shivers Culpin| title =The Administrations of Nathaniel Langford and Philetus Norris| work =A History of Administrative Development in Yellowstone National Park, 1872<U+2013>1965| publisher = Yellowstone National Park| url =http://64.241.25.110/yell/pdfs/history/administration/chapter1.pdf| format =PDF| date =July 5, 2006|accessdate = 2007-04-01}}</ref>
Having traveled through Yellowstone, and witnessed land management problems first hand, [[Philetus Norris]] volunteered for the position following Langford's exit. Congress finally saw fit to implement a salary for the position, as well as to provide a minimal funding to operate the park. Norris used these monies to expand access to the park, building numerous crude roads and facilities.<ref name="norris"/> Norris hired [[Harry Yount]] to control poaching and vandalism in the park. Today, Harry Yount is considered the first national park ranger.<ref name="yount">{{cite web| last = | first = | title = Yellowstone National Park's First 130 Years|work = Yellowstone History| publisher = National Park Service| url = http://windowsintowonderland.org/history/army&nps/page6.htm| accessdate = 2007-04-01}}</ref> These measures still proved to be insufficient in protecting the park, as neither Norris, nor the three superintendents who followed, were given sufficient manpower or resources.
[[Image:Fort Yellowstone-750px.jpg|thumb|right|Fort Yellowstone, formerly a U.S. Army base, now serves as park headquarters]]
The [[Northern Pacific Railroad]] built a [[train station]] in [[Livingston, Montana]] connecting to the northern entrance in the early 1880s, which helped to increase visitation from 300 in 1872 to 5,000 in 1883.<ref name="tour">{{cite web| last = | first = | title = Yellowstone National Park's First 130 Years|work = Yellowstone History| publisher = National Park Service| url = http://windowsintowonderland.org/history/army&nps/page16.htm| accessdate = 2007-04-01}}</ref> Visitors in these early years were faced with poor roads and limited services and most access into the park was on horse or via [[stagecoach]].  By 1908 visitation would increase enough to also attract a [[Union Pacific|Union Pacific Railroad]] connection to West Yellowstone, though rail visitation would fall off considerably by [[World War II]] and cease around the 1960s.   

Ongoing poaching and destruction of natural resources continued unabated until the U.S. Army arrived at [[Mammoth Hot Springs]] in 1886 and built Camp Sheridan. Over the next 22 years the army constructed permanent structures and Camp Sheridan was renamed [[Fort Yellowstone]].<ref name="army">{{cite web| last = Rydell| first =Kiki Leigh| coauthors =Mary Shivers Culpin| title =The United States Army Takes Control of Yellowstone National Park 1886<U+2013>1906| work =A History of Administrative Development in Yellowstone National Park, 1872<U+2013>1965| publisher = Yellowstone National Park| date =July 5, 2006| url =http://64.241.25.110/yell/pdfs/history/administration/chapter3.pdf| format =PDF| accessdate = 2007-04-01}}</ref> With the funding and manpower necessary to keep a diligent watch, the army developed their own policies and regulations that permitted public access while protecting park wildlife and natural resources.

By 1915, 1,000 automobiles entered the park, resulting in conflicts with horses and horse driven transportation. In subsequent years horse travel on roads was eventually prohibited.<ref name="cars">{{cite web| last = | first = | title = Yellowstone National Park's First 130 Years|work = Yellowstone History| publisher = National Park Service| url = http://windowsintowonderland.org/history/army&nps/page17.htm| accessdate = 2007-04-01}}</ref>  Between 1933 and 1941, the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] built the majority of the early visitor centers, campgrounds and the current system of park roads.

In 1959, a powerful [[earthquake]] just north of Yellowstone at [[Quake Lake]] damaged roads and some structures in the park. In the northwest section of the park, new geysers were found and many existing hot springs became turbid.<ref name="earthquake">{{cite web | url = http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/events/1959_08_18.php | title = Largest Earthquake in Montana | format = | work = Historic Earthquakes | publisher = U.S. Geological Survey |date=January 24, 2007| accessdate = 2007-03-20}}</ref> 

The [[Yellowstone Fire of 1988]] was the largest [[forest fire]] in the history of the park. Approximately 793,880&nbsp;acres (3,213&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) or 36 percent of the parkland was impacted by the fires, leading to a systematic reevaluation of fire management policies. The fire season of 1988 was considered normal until a combination of drought and heat by mid-July of that year contributed to an extreme fire danger. On "Black Saturday," [[August 20]], [[1988]], strong winds expanded the fires rapidly, and more than 150,000&nbsp;acres (610&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) were consumed.<ref name="fires">{{cite web | url = http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/fire.htm | title = Wildland Fire in Yellowstone | format = | work = | publisher = National Park Service |date=July 26, 2006| accessdate = 2007-02-28}}</ref> 

The expansive cultural history of the park has been documented by the 1,000 [[archeology|archeological]] sites that have been discovered. The park has 1,106 historic structures and features, and of these [[Obsidian Cliff]] and five buildings have been designated [[National Historic Landmarks]].<ref name="facts"/>  Yellowstone was designated an [[International Biosphere Reserve]] on [[October 26]], [[1976]], and a [[United Nations]] [[World Heritage Site]] on [[September 8]], [[1978]].

==Geography==
[[Image:lakeyellowstonebig.jpg|right|thumb|Yellowstone Lake on a Fall morning]]
Approximately 96 percent of the land area of Yellowstone National Park is located within the state of Wyoming. Another 3 percent is within Montana, with the remaining 1 percent in Idaho. The park is 63&nbsp;miles (102&nbsp;km) north to south, and 54&nbsp;miles (87&nbsp;km) west to east by air. At 2,219,789&nbsp;acres (8,983 km<U+00B2>), Yellowstone is larger than the states of [[Rhode Island]] and [[Delaware]] combined. Rivers and lakes cover 5 percent of the land area, with the largest water body being [[Yellowstone Lake]] at  87,040&nbsp;acres (352.2 km<U+00B2>). Yellowstone Lake is up to 400&nbsp;feet (122&nbsp;m) deep and has 110&nbsp;miles (177&nbsp;km) of shoreline. Sitting at an elevation of 7,733&nbsp;feet (2,357&nbsp;m) above sea level, Yellowstone Lake is the largest high altitude lake in North America. Forests comprise 80 percent of the land area of the park; most of the rest is [[prairie|grassland]].<ref name="facts"/>

The [[Continental Divide]] of North America runs diagonally through the southwestern part of the park. The divide is a [[topography|topographic]] feature that separates [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]] water drainages. About one third of the park lies on the west side of the divide. The origins of the Yellowstone and [[Snake River]]s are near each other, however on opposite sides of the divide. As a result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the [[Gulf of Mexico]].
[[Image:Lewis Falls.jpg|thumb|right|Lewis Falls on the Lewis River]]

The park sits on the [[Yellowstone Plateau]], at an average altitude of 8,000&nbsp;feet (2,400&nbsp;m) above [[sea level]]. The plateau is bounded on nearly all sides by [[mountain range]]s of the [[Rocky Mountains|Middle Rocky Mountains]], which range from 9,000 to 11,000&nbsp;feet (2,743 to 3,352&nbsp;m) in elevation. The highest point in the park is atop [[Eagle Peak (Wyoming)|Eagle Peak]] (11,358&nbsp;ft/3,462&nbsp;m) and the lowest is along Reese Creek (5,282&nbsp;ft/1,610&nbsp;m).<ref name="facts"/>  Nearby mountain ranges include the [[Gallatin Range]] to the northwest, the [[Beartooth Mountains]] in the north, the [[Absaroka Mountains]] to the east, and the [[Teton Mountains]] and the [[Madison Range]] to the southwest and west. The most prominent summit on the Yellowstone Plateau is [[Mount Washburn]] at 10,243&nbsp;feet (3,122&nbsp;m).  

Yellowstone National Park has one of the world's largest petrified forests, trees which were long ago buried by ash and soil and transformed from wood to mineral materials. There are 290 [[waterfall]]s of at least 15&nbsp;feet (4.5&nbsp;m) in the park, the highest being the [[Yellowstone Falls|Lower Falls of the Yellowstone River]] at 308&nbsp;feet (94&nbsp;m).<ref name="facts"/>

Two deep canyons are located in the park, cut through the volcanic tuff of the Yellowstone Plateau by rivers over the last 640,000&nbsp;years. The [[Lewis River (Wyoming)|Lewis River]] flows through [[Lewis Canyon]] in the south and the [[Yellowstone River]] has carved the colorful [[Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone]] in its journey north.

Yellowstone is at the northeastern end of the [[Snake River Plain]], a great U-shaped arc through the mountains, that extends from [[Boise, Idaho]] some {{unit mi|400|-1}} to the west. This feature traces the route over the last 17 million years of the [[North American Plate]] as it was transported by [[plate tectonics]] across a stationary [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]].

The [[Yellowstone Caldera]] is the largest volcanic system in North America. It has been termed a "[[supervolcano]]" because the caldera was formed by exceptionally large explosive eruptions. The current caldera was created by a cataclysmic eruption that occurred 640,000&nbsp;years ago, which released 240&nbsp;cubic miles (1,000&nbsp;km<U+00B3>) of ash, rock and [[pyroclast]]ic materials. This eruption was 1,000 times larger than the [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens]].<ref name="volcanic">{{cite web| url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs100-03/| title = Tracking Changes in Yellowstone's Restless Volcanic System| work = | publisher = U.S. Geological Survey| date=January 19, 2006|accessdate = 2007-03-12}}</ref>  It produced a [[Volcanic crater|crater]] nearly a two thirds of a mile (1&nbsp;km) deep and 52 by 28&nbsp;miles (85 by 45&nbsp;km) in area and deposited the [[Lava Creek Tuff]], a [[Tuff#Welded tuff|welded tuff]] [[geologic formation]].

Each of the three climax eruptions released vast amounts of ash that blanketed much of central North America falling many hundreds of miles away. The amount of ash and gases released into the atmosphere probably caused significant impacts to world weather patterns and led to the [[extinction]] of many species, primarily in North America.<ref name="sciamerican">{{cite web|last= Bindeman |first=Ilya N.| title = The Secrets of Supervolcanoes| work = | publisher = Scientific American|url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&colID=1&articleID=0006E0BF-BB43-146C-BB4383414B7F0000| date = June 2006 | accessdate = 2007-04-12}}</ref> 

A subsequent minor climax eruption occurred 160,000 years ago. It formed the relatively small caldera that contains the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake. Later, two smaller eruptive cyles, the last one ending about 70,000 years ago, buried much of the caldera under thick lava flows.<ref name="volcanic history"/>

Each eruption is in fact a part of an eruptive cycle that climaxes with the collapse of the roof of a partially emptied [[magma chamber]]. This creates a crater, called a caldera, and releases vast amounts of volcanic material, usually through fissures that ring the caldera. The time between the last three cataclysmic eruptions in the Yellowstone area has ranged from 600,000 to 900,000 years, but the small number of such climax eruptions can not be used to make a prediction for future volcanic events.<ref name="time">{{cite web| url = http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/faqsfactivity.html#eruptagain| title = Questions About Future Volcanic Activity | work = Yellowstone Volcano Observatory| publisher = U.S. Geological Survey| date = February 2, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-04-08}}</ref>

Between 630,000 and 70,000&nbsp;years ago, Yellowstone Caldera was nearly filled in with periodic eruptions of [[rhyolite|rhyolitic]] lavas such as those that can be seen at [[Obsidian Cliff]]s and [[basalt]]ic lavas which can be viewed at [[Sheepeaters Cliff]]. Lava strata is most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic [[V-shaped valley]], indicative of river-type erosion rather erosion caused by [[glacier|glaciation]]. 

The most famous geyser in the park, and perhaps the world, is [[Old Faithful Geyser]], located in [[Upper Geyser Basin]]; the park also contains the largest active geyser in the world&mdash;[[Steamboat Geyser]] in the [[Norris Geyser Basin]].

Yellowstone experiences thousands of small [[earthquakes]] every year, virtually all of which are undetectable to people.  There have been six earthquakes with at least [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] 6 or greater in historical times, including a 7.5 magnitude quake that struck just outside the northwest boundary of the park in 1959. This quake triggered a huge [[landslide]], which caused a partial dam collapse on [[Hebgen Lake]]; immediately downstream, the sediment from the landslide dammed the river and created a new lake, known as [[Quake Lake|earthquake lake]]. Twenty-eight people were killed and property damage was extensive in the immediate region. The quake caused some geysers in the northwestern section of the park to erupt, large cracks in the ground formed and emitted steam, and some hot springs normally clear water turned muddy.<ref name="earthquake"/> A 6.1 magnitude quake struck inside the park on [[June 30]] [[1975]], but damage was minimal. For three months in 1985, 3,000 minor earthquakes were detected in the northwestern section of the park, during what has been referred to as an earthquake swarm, and has been attributed to minor subsidence of the Yellowstone caldera.<ref name="volcanic"/> Beginning on [[April 30]], [[2007]], sixteen small earthquakes with magnitudes up to 2.7 occurred in the Yellowstone Caldera for several days. These swarms of earthquakes are common and there have been 70 such swarms between 1983 and 2006.<ref name="swarms">{{cite news | title =More Than A Dozen Earthquakes Shake Yellowstone| publisher =KUTV News| date =May 6, 2007| url =http://kutv.com/national/local_story_126175405.html| accessdate = 2007-05-07 }}</ref>

===Flora===
1,700 species of trees, plants, lichens and other vascular plants are native to the park. Another 170 species are considered to be [[exotic species]] and are non-native. Of the eight [[conifer]] tree species documented, [[Lodgepole pine]] forests cover 80 percent of the total forested areas.<ref name="facts"/> Other conifers, such as the [[douglas fir]] and [[whitebark pine]], are found in scattered groves throughout the park.  As of 2007, the whitebark pine is threatened by a [[fungus]] known as [[Cronartium ribicola|white pine blister rust]]; however, this is mostly confined to forests well to the north and west. In Yellowstone, about seven percent of the whitebark pine species have been impacted with the fungus, compared to nearly complete infestations in northwestern Montana.<ref name="whitebark">{{cite web| last=Kendall|first=Katherine|

In Yellowstone's hot waters, [[bacteria]] form mats of bizarre shapes consisting of trillions of individuals. These bacteria are some of the most primitive lifeforms on earth. Flies and other [[arthropod]]s live on the mats, even in the middle of the bitterly cold winters. Initially, scientists thought that microbes there gained sustenance only from [[sulfur]].

Non-native plants sometimes threaten native species by using up nutrient resources. Though exotic species are most commonly found in areas with the greatest human visitation, such as near roads and at major tourist areas, they have also spread into the backcountry.

===Fauna===
{{main|Animals of Yellowstone|Wolf reintroduction|Grizzly Bear}}
[[Image:Bison near a hot spring in Yellowstone-750px.JPG|thumb|right|[[American Bison|Bison]] graze near a hot spring]]
Yellowstone is widely considered to be the finest megafauna wildlife habitat in the [[contiguous United States|lower 48 states]]. There are almost 60 species of [[mammal]]s in the park, including the [[endangered species|endangered]] [[gray wolf]] and the [[threatened species|threatened]] [[lynx]] and [[grizzly bear]].<ref name="facts"/> Other large mammals include the [[American bison|bison]] (buffalo), [[American black bear|black bear]], [[Cervus canadensis|elk]], [[moose]], [[mule deer]], [[pronghorn]], [[bighorn sheep]] and [[mountain lion]] (puma). 

The relatively large bison populations are a concern for ranchers, who fear that the species can transmit [[bovine]] diseases to their domesticated cousins. In fact, about half of Yellowstone's bison have been exposed to [[brucellosis]], a [[bacterium|bacterial]] disease that came to North America with [[Europe]]an cattle that may cause [[cattle]] to [[miscarriage|miscarry]]. The disease has little effect on park bison and no reported case of transmission from wild bison to domestic livestock has ever been filed. However, the [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS) has stated that Bison are the "likely source" of the spread of the disease in cattle in Wyoming and [[North Dakota]]. Elk also carry the disease, and are believed to have transmitted the infection to horses and cattle.<ref name="aphis">{{cite web| title =Brucellosis and Yellowstone Bison| work =Brucellosis| publisher =Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service| url =http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nahps/brucellosis/cattle.htm| accessdate = 2007-03-16}}</ref> Bison once numbered between 30 and 60 million individuals throughout North America, and Yellowstone remains one of their last strongholds. Their populations had increased from less than 50 in the park in 1902 to 4,000 by 2003.<ref name="bison2">{{cite web| title = Frequently Asked Questions About Bison | work =Nature and Science| publisher =National Park Service| date=August 9, 2006|url =http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/bisonqa.htm| date=August 09, 2006 |accessdate = 2007-04-01}}</ref> 

To combat the perceived threat, national park personnel regularly harass bison herds back into the park when they venture outside of the area's borders. During the winter of 1996<U+2013>97, the bison herd was so large that 1,079 bison that had exited the park were shot or sent to slaughter.<ref name="aphis"/> [[Animal rights]] activists argue that this is a cruel practice and that the possibility for disease transmission is not as great as some ranchers maintain. Ecologists point out that the bison are merely traveling to seasonal grazing areas that lie within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem that have been converted to cattle grazing, some of which are within [[United States National Forests]] and are leased to private ranchers. APHIS has stated that with vaccinations and other means, brucellosis can be eliminated from the bison and elk herds throughout Yellowstone.<ref name="aphis"/> 

After the wolves were extirpated from Yellowstone, the [[coyote]] then became the park's top canine predator. However, the coyote is not able to bring down large animals and the result of this lack of a top predator on these populations was a marked increase in lame and sick megafauna. [[Image:anWolfRunningInSnow.jpg|right|thumb|Reintroduced [[gray wolf]] in Yellowstone]] Starting in 1914, in an effort to protect elk populations, the [[U.S. Congress]] appropriated funds to be used for the purposes of ''"destroying wolves, prairie dogs, and other animals injurious to agriculture and animal husbandry"'' on public lands. Park Service hunters carried out these orders and by 1926 they had killed 136 wolves. By this time, wolves were virtually eliminated from Yellowstone.<ref name="dow">{{cite web | title= Defenders of Wildlife| work= A Yellowstone Chronology| url=http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html| accessdate=2007-03-19}}</ref> Further exterminations continued until the National Park Service ended the practice in 1935. With the passing of the [[Endangered Species Act]] in 1973, the wolf was one of the first mammal species listed.<ref name="dow"/>

By the 1990s, the Federal government had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial decision by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] (which oversees threatened and endangered species), wolves, imported from Canada, were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004, but may be attributable to wolf migration to other nearby areas as suggested by the substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval.<ref name="rmw">{{cite web| title =Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery 2005 Interagency Annual Report| work =| publisher =U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Nez Perce Tribe, National Park Service, Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks, Idaho Fish and Game, and USDA Wildlife Services| date =| url =http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/species/mammals/wolf/annualrpt05/2005_WOLF_REPORT_TOTAL.pdf| format = PDF |date=2006| accessdate = 2007-03-19}}</ref> Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 1995<U+2013>96.<ref name="rmw"/> The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho has been so successful that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed delisting the wolf as a threatened and endangered species.<ref name="delisting">{{cite web| last =| first = | title = Service Announces Intent to remove the Rocky Mountain Population of Gray Wolves from Endangered Species List | publisher = U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service| date = February 2, 2006 | url = http://mountain-prairie.fws.gov/pressrel/WO%2004.htm| accessdate = 2007-03-19}}</ref>  

An estimated 600 grizzly bears live in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, with more than half of the population habitating within Yellowstone. The grizzly is currently listed as a threatened species, however the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has announced that they intend to take it off the endangered species list for the Yellowstone region, but will likely keep it listed in areas where it has not yet recovered fully.

Population figures for elk are in excess of 30,000&mdash;the largest population of any large mammal species in Yellowstone. The northern herd has decreased enormously since the mid-1990s, and this has been attributed to wolf predation and causal effects such as elk using more forested regions to evade predation, consequently making it harder for researchers to accurately count them.<ref name="elk count">{{cite news | title =2006<U+2013>2007 Winter Count of Northern Yellowstone Elk|publisher =National Park Service| date =January 16, 2007| url =http://www.nps.gov/archive/yell/press/nycwwg.htm| accessdate = 2007-03-19}}</ref> The northern herd migrates west into southwestern Montana in the winter.

==Forest fires==
{{main|Yellowstone Fire of 1988}}
[[Image:Yellowstonefire.jpg|right|thumb|Fire in Yellowstone National Park]]
[[Wildfire]] is a natural part of most ecosystems, and plants found in Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways. Douglas fir have a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires. Lodgepole pines &mdash;the most common tree species in the park&mdash; generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and down wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish. Whitebark pine and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur. Aspen trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed as they are insulated from the heat by soil.<ref name="fireecology">{{cite web| last = | first = | title =Fire Ecology | work =Yellowstone Wildland Fire| publisher =National Park Service| date =October 25, 2006| url =http://www.nps.gov/archive/yell/technical/fire/ecology.htm| accessdate = 2007-03-21}}</ref> Fire ecologists estimate that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years.<ref name="fireecology"/>

About thirty-five natural forest fires are ignited each year by [[lightning]], while another six to ten are started by people&mdash; in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three [[fire lookout|fire towers]], each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, though it is closed to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air, and relies on visitor reports of smoke and or flames.<ref name="firelookout">{{cite web| last = | first = | title =Yellowstone Lookouts | work =Yellowstone Wildland Fire| publisher =National Park Service| date =October 25, 2006 | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/yell/technical/fire/Suppression/Lookouts.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-21}}</ref> Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September&mdash; the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity in the late afternoon and evening. Few fires ever burn more than 100&nbsp;acres (40&nbsp;ha) and the vast majority of fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5&nbsp;ha) before they burn themselves out.<ref name="firefacts">{{cite web| last = | first = | title =Fire Facts | work =Yellowstone Wildland Fire| publisher =National Park Service| date =October 25, 2006| url =http://www.nps.gov/archive/yell/technical/fire/factoid.htm| accessdate = 2007-03-21}}</ref> Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture and the weather to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused fires and to evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed.<ref name="monitor">{{cite web| last = | first = | title =Fire Monitoring | work =Yellowstone Wildland Fire| publisher =National Park Service| date =October 25, 2006| url =http://www.nps.gov/archive/yell/technical/fire/monitor.htm| accessdate = 2007-03-21}}</ref> 

In an effort to minimize the chances of out of control fires and threats to people and structures, park employees do more than just monitor the potential for fire. [[Controlled burn]]s are prescribed fires which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural fires are sometimes considered prescribed fires if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few fires deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, over the last 30 years, over 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and other hazards from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of fire danger in these areas.<ref name="prescribed ">{{cite web| last = | first = | title =Prescribed Fire | work =Yellowstone Wildland Fire| publisher =National Park Service| date =October 25, 2006| url =http://www.nps.gov/archive/yell/technical/fire/prescribed.htm| accessdate = 2007-03-21}}</ref> Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of high fire danger.

The common notion in early United States land management policies was that all forest fires were bad. Fire was seen as a purely destructive force. and there was little understanding that it was an integral part of the ecosystem. Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was developed, all fires were suppressed. This led to an increase in dead and dying forests, which would later provide the fuel load for fires that would be much harder, and in some cases, impossible to control. Fire Management Plans were implemented, detailing that natural fires should be allowed to burn if they posed no immediate threat to lives and property. 

After a wet Spring in 1988, by Summer, drought began to set in throughout the northern Rockies, creating the driest year on record to that point. Grasses and plants which grew well in the early Summer from the abundant Spring moisture produced plenty of grass, which soon turned to dry tinder. The National Park Service began fire fighting efforts to keep the fires under control, but the extreme drought made suppression difficult. Between the 15th and 21st of July, 1988, fires quickly spread from 8,500&nbsp;acres (34 km<U+00B2>) throughout the entire Yellowstone region, which included areas outside the park, to 99,000&nbsp;acres (40,063&nbsp;ha) on the park land alone. By the end of the month, the fires were out of control. Large fires burned together and on August 20, 1988, the single worst day of the fires, more than 150,000&nbsp;acres (610&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) were consumed. Seven large fires were responsible for 95% of the 793,000&nbsp;acres (3,210 km<U+00B2>) that were burned over the next couple of months. A total of 25,000 firefighters and U.S. military forces participated in the suppression efforts, at a cost of 120 million dollars. By the time Winter brought snow that helped extinguish the last flames, the fires had  destroyed 67 structures and caused several million dollars in damage.<ref name="fires"/> Though no civilian lives were lost, two personnel associated with the fire fighting efforts were killed.

Contrary to media reports and speculation at the time, the fires killed very few park animals&mdash; surveys indicated that only about 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000<U+2013>50,000), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Changes in fire management policies were implemented by land management agencies throughout the U.S., based on knowledge gained from the 1988 fires and the evaluation of scientists and experts from various fields. By 1992, Yellowstone had adopted a new fire management plan which observed stricter guidelines for the management of natural fires.<ref name="fires"/>

==Climate==
[[Image:Yellowstonewinter.jpg|right|thumb|Winter scene in Yellowstone]]
Yellowstone climate is greatly influenced by altitude, with lower elevations generally found to be warmer year round. The record high temperature was 98&nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|<U+00B0>F]] (37&nbsp;[[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]]) in 1936, while the coldest temperature was recorded as -66&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (-54&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) in 1933.<ref name="facts"/> During the Summer months of June through early September, daytime highs are normally in the 70 to 80&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (20 to 25&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) range, while nighttime lows can go to below freezing (0&nbsp;<U+00B0>C)&mdash;especially at higher altitudes. Summer afternoons are frequently accompanied by [[thunderstorm]]s. Spring and Fall temperatures range between 30 and 60&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (0 to 20&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) with cold nights in the teens to single digits (-5 to -20&nbsp;<U+00B0>C). Winter in Yellowstone is very cold with high temperatures usually between zero to 20&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (-20 to -5C&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) and nighttime temperatures below zero&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (-20&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) for most of the winter.<ref name="weather">{{cite web| last = | first = | title =Weather| work =| publisher =National Park Service| date =December 20, 2006| url =http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/weather.htm| accessdate = 2007-03-20}}</ref>
 
Precipitation in Yellowstone is highly variable, and ranges from 15&nbsp;inches (38&nbsp;cm) annually near Mammoth Hot Springs, to 80&nbsp;inches (200&nbsp;cm) in the southwestern sections of the park. The precipitation of Yellowstone is greatly influenced by the moisture channel formed by the [[Snake River Plain]] to the west, that was, in turn, formed by Yellowstone itself.  Snow is possible in any month of the year, with averages of 150&nbsp;inches (380&nbsp;cm) annually around Yellowstone Lake, to twice that amount at higher elevations.<ref name="weather"/>

[[Tornado]]s in Yellowstone are rare; however, on [[July 21]], [[1987]] the most powerful tornado recorded in the state of Wyoming touched down in the [[Teton Wilderness]] of [[Bridger-Teton National Forest]], and hit Yellowstone National Park. The tornado was classified as an [[Fujita Scale|F4]], with wind speeds estimated at between 207 and 260&nbsp;mph (333 to 418&nbsp;km/h). The tornado left a path of destruction 1 to 2&nbsp;miles (1.6 to 3.2&nbsp;km) wide, and 24&nbsp;miles (38&nbsp;km) long, and leveled 15,000&nbsp;acres (61 km<U+00B2>) of mature pine forest.<ref name="tornado">{{cite web| last = | first = | title = Severe Weather| work =| publisher =Wyoming Climate Office| date =March 14, 2007| url =http://www.wrds.uwyo.edu/wrds/wsc/climateatlas/severe_weather.html| accessdate = 2007-03-20}}</ref>

==Recreation== 
{{main|Trails of Yellowstone National Park}}
[[Image:YellowstoneMap.png|right|thumb|Orientation map of Yellowstone National Park showing many of the major tourist attractions.]]
Yellowstone is one of the most popular national parks in the United States. Since the mid-1960s, at least 2 million tourists have visited the park almost every year.<ref name="Visitation"/> At peak summer levels, 3,700 employees work for Yellowstone National Park concessionaires. Concessionaires manage nine hotels and lodges, with a total of 2,238 hotel rooms and cabins available. They also oversee gas stations, stores and most of the campgrounds. Another 800 employees work either permanently or seasonally for the National Park Service.<ref name="facts"/> 

Park service roads lead to major features; however, road reconstruction has produced temporary road closures. Yellowstone is in the midst of a long term, possibly indefinite, road reconstruction effort, which is hampered by a short repair season. In the winter, all roads aside from the one which enters from [[Gardiner, Montana]] and extends to [[Cooke City, Montana]] are closed to wheeled vehicles.<ref name="roads">{{cite web| title =Road Construction Delays and Closures| publisher =National Park Service|date=April 9, 2007| url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/roadclosures.htm|accessdate = 2007-04-23}}</ref> Park roads are closed to wheeled vehicles from early November to mid April, but some park roads remain closed until mid&mdash;May.<ref name="hours">{{cite web| title =Operating Hours & Seasons| publisher =National Park Service|date= April 22, 2007|url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/hours.htm|accessdate = 2007-03-21}}</ref> The park has 310&nbsp;miles (499&nbsp;km) of paved roads which can be accessed from 5 different entrances.<ref name="facts"/> There is no public transportation available inside the park, but a number of tour companies can be contacted for guided motorized transport. In the winter, a number of concessionaires operate guided [[snowmobile]] and [[snow coach]] tours.<ref name="winter">{{cite web| title =Winter Services in Yellowstone| publisher =National Park Service| url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/winterser.htm|accessdate = 2007-03-21}}</ref> Facilities in the Old Faithful, Canyon and Mammoth Hot Springs areas of the park are very busy during the summer months. Traffic jams created by road construction or by people observing wildlife can result in long delays.
[[Image:IMG 0302.JPG|thumb|left|Old Faithful Inn.]]
The National Park Service maintains 9 visitor centers and museums, and is responsible for maintenance of historical structures and many of the other 2,000 buildings. These structures include National Historical Landmarks such as the [[Old Faithful Inn]] built in 1903<U+2013>04 and the entire [[Fort Yellowstone|Fort Yellowstone - Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District]]. A historical tour is available at Fort Yellowstone which details the history of the National Park Service and the development of the park. Campfire programs, guided walks and other interpretive presentations are available at numerous locations in the summer, and on a limited basis during other seasons. 

[[Camping]] is available at a dozen campgrounds with more than 2,000 campsites.<ref name="facts"/> Some of the campgrounds allow advance reservations while others are first come, first served. Camping is also available in surrounding National Forests, as well as in Grand Teton National Park to the south. [[Backcountry]] campsites are accessible only by foot or by [[horseback riding|horseback]] and require a permit. There are 1,100&nbsp;miles (1,770&nbsp;km) of [[hiking]] trails available.<ref name="hikes">{{cite web| title =Hiking in the Park| publisher =National Park Service|date=August 17, 2006| url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/hiking.htm|accessdate = 2007-03-21}}</ref> The park is not considered to be a good destination for [[mountaineering]] due to the instability of  volcanic rock which predominates. Visitors with pets are required to keep them on a leash at all times and are limited to areas near roadways and in "frontcountry" zones such as drive in campgrounds.<ref name="pets">{{cite web| title =Regulations Regarding Pets| publisher =National Park Service|date=July 12, 2006| url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/pets.htm|accessdate = 2007-03-21}}</ref> Around thermal features, wooden and paved trails have been constructed to ensure visitor safety and most of these areas are handicapped accessible.[[Image:YellowstoneBears.jpg|thumb|right|Despite warnings from park officials, visitors have often fed bears]] Thermal features can be dangerous areas and it is important to remain on well marked trails as the ground is oftentimes unstable. Wildlife should never be approached as many are capable of inflicting bodily injury or death. The National Park Service maintains a year round clinic at Mammoth Hot Springs and provides emergency services throughout the year.<ref name="safety">{{cite web| title =Information Every Visitor Needs to Know| publisher =National Park Service|date= March 06, 2007|url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/yoursafety.htm|accessdate = 2007-03-21}}</ref>

[[Hunting]] is not permitted, though it is in the surrounding National Forests in season. [[Fishing]] is a popular activity and a Yellowstone Park fishing license is required to fish in park waters.<ref name="fishing">{{cite web| title =Fishing in Yellowstone National Park| publisher =National Park Service| date=April 04, 2007|url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/fishing.htm|accessdate = 2007-03-21}}</ref> Boating is prohibited on rivers and creeks except for a 5&nbsp;mile (8&nbsp;km) stretch of the Lewis River between Lewis and Shoshone Lakes, and is open to non-motorized use only. Yellowstone Lake has a marina and the lake is the most popular boating destination.<ref name="boating">{{cite web| title =Boating in Yellowstone National Park| publisher =National Park Service|date=September 18, 2006| url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/boating.htm|accessdate = 2007-03-21}}</ref>

Other protected lands in the region include [[Caribou-Targhee National Forest|Caribou-Targhee]], [[Gallatin National Forest|Gallatin]], [[Custer National Forest|Custer]], [[Shoshone National Forest|Shoshone]] and Bridger-Teton National Forests. The National Park Service's [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway]] is to the south and leads to Grand Teton National Park. The famed [[Beartooth Highway]] provides spectacular high altitude scenery and is the route one takes if entering from the northeast. Nearby communities include [[West Yellowstone, Montana]]; [[Cody, Wyoming]]; [[Red Lodge, Montana]]; [[Ashton, Idaho]]; and [[Gardiner, Montana]]. The closest air transport is available by way of [[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]]; [[Billings, Montana]]; [[Jackson, Wyoming|Jackson]]; [[Cody, Wyoming]] or [[Idaho Falls, Idaho]].<ref name="directions">{{cite web| title =Directions| publisher =National Park Service|date=January 04, 2007| url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/directions.htm|accessdate = 2007-01-04}}</ref> [[Salt Lake City]], 320&nbsp;miles (515&nbsp;km) to the south, is the closest large metropolitan area.
