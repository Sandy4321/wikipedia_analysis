'''Folk rock''' is a musical genre, combining elements of [[folk music]] and [[rock music]]. In its earliest and narrowest sense, the term referred to a genre that arose in the United States and the [[UK]] around the mid-1960s. The sound was epitomized by tight vocal harmonies and a relatively "clean" ([[guitar effects|effects]]- and [[Distortion (guitar)|distortion]]-free) approach to electric instruments epitomized by the jangly 12-string sound of the [[Byrds]]' [[guitar]]ist [[Roger McGuinn]] as used sparingly by [[George Harrison]] in 1964 and 1965. The repertoire was drawn in part from folk sources, but even more from folk-influenced [[singer-songwriter]]s such as [[Bob Dylan]]. Roger McGuinn of the Byrds has also stated [[The Beatles]] inspired him to mix folk with rock music. ''[[Allmusic]]'' also credits [[The Beatles]], along with Dylan, as being heavily influential on the folk rock explosion of 1965.<ref> {{cite web |title= Allmusic Biography|url= http://www.allmusicguide.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:hifrxqw5ldse~T1|accessdate=2008-02-05}} </ref>

==Overview==
This original folk rock directly led to the distinct, eclectic style of [[electric folk]] (a.k.a. British folk rock) pioneered in the late 1960s by [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]] and [[Fairport Convention]]. Starting from a North-American style folk rock, Pentangle, Fairport and other related bands deliberately incorporated elements of traditional [[United Kingdom|British]] folk music. At the same time, in Brittany, [[Alan Stivell]] began to mix his Breton roots with [[Ireland|Irish]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] roots and with rock music. Very shortly afterwards, Fairport bassist [[Ashley Hutchings]] formed [[Steeleye Span]] in collaboration with traditionalist folk musicians who wished to incorporate electrical amplification, and later overt rock elements, into their music.

This, in turn, spawned several other variants: the self-consciously [[England|English]] folk rock of the [[Albion Band]] and some of [[Ronnie Lane]]'s solo work, and the more prolific current of [[Celtic rock]], incorporating traditional music of [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], and [[Brittany]]. Through at least the first half of the 1970s, Celtic rock held close to folk roots, with its repertoire drawing heavily on traditional Celtic [[fiddle]], pipe and [[harp]] tunes including traditional vocal styles, but making use of rock band levels of amplification and percussion.

In a broader sense, folk rock includes later similarly-inspired musical genres and movements in the [[English language|English]]-speaking world (and its [[Celt]]ic  and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] fringes) and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in [[Europe]]. As with any genre, the borders are difficult to define. Folk rock may lean more toward folk or toward rock in its instrumentation, its playing and vocal style, or its choice of material; while the original genre draws on  music of Europe and North America, there is no clear delineation of which folk cultures music might be included as influences. Still, the term is not usually applied to rock music rooted in the [[blues]]-based or other [[African American]] music (except as mediated through [[folk revival]]ists), nor to rock music with [[Cajun]] roots, nor to music (especially after about 1980) with non-European folk roots, which is more typically classified as [[world music]].

==History==
===Antecedents===

Folk rock arose mainly from the confluence of three elements: urban/collegiate folk vocal groups; singer-songwriters and the revival of North American rock and roll after the [[British Invasion]]. Of these, the first two owed direct debts to [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Pete Seeger]] and the [[Popular Front]] culture of the 1930s. The first of the urban folk vocal groups was the [[Almanac Singers]], whose shifting membership during the late 1930s and early 1940s included Guthrie and [[Lee Hays]]. In 1947 Seeger and Hays joined [[Ronnie Gilbert]], and Fred Hellerman to form [[the Weavers]], who popularized the genre and had a major hit with a cleaned-up cover of [[Leadbelly]]'s "[[Goodnight, Irene]]", but fell foul of the U.S. [[Second Red Scare|Red Scare]] of the early 1950s. 

Their sound, and their broad repertoire of traditional folk material and [[topical song]]s inspired other groups such as [[the Kingston Trio]] (founded 1957), the [[Chad Mitchell Trio]], [[New Christy Minstrels]], and the (usually less political) "collegiate folk" groups such as [[The Brothers Four]], [[The Four Freshmen]], [[The Four Preps]], and [[The Highwaymen (folk band)|The Highwaymen]]. All featured tight vocal harmonies and a repertoire at least initially rooted in folk music and (in some cases) topical songs. The successors of such groups were bands such as [[We Five]] and [[The Mamas & the Papas]] (1965-8).

When the term ''singer-songwriter'' was coined in the mid-1960s, it was applied retroactively to [[Bob Dylan]], [[Fred Neil]], and other (mainly [[New York City|New York]]-based) folk-rooted songwriters. [[Paul Simon]], Australian [[Bruce Woodley]] of [[The Seekers]], and the [[Scotland|Scottish]] singer [[Donovan]] also fit this mould. Dylan's material would provide much of the original grist for the folk rock mill, not only in the U.S. but in the UK as well. None of this would likely ever have intersected with rock music, though, if it had not been for the impulse of the British Invasion. [[The Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], and numerous other British bands reintroduced to America the broad potential of rock and roll as a creative medium. One of the first bands to craft a distinctly American sound in response was [[the Beach Boys]]; while not a folk rock band themselves, they directly influenced the genre, and at the height of the folk rock boom in 1966 had a hit with a cover of the 1920s [[West Indies|West Indian]] folk song "[[Sloop John B]]", which they had learned from The Kingston Trio, who, in turn, had learned it from the Weavers.

However, there are a few antecedents to folk rock in pre-British Invasion American rock; one could cite [[Link Wray]] (part [[Shawnee]], drawing upon tribal [[drum]] rhythms) in "Fatback and Beans", as well as some of the later recordings of [[Buddy Holly]], which strongly influenced artists like Dylan and the Byrds, and to some extent some recordings by [[country music|country]]-influenced performers like [[The Everly Brothers]]. This was not a recognized trend at the time, and probably would have not been noticed if not for subsequent events.

===1960s origins===
Much of the early folk-rock music emerged during a time of general global upheaval, the [[Vietnam War]], and new concerns for the world by young people. In the [[United States]] the heyday of folk rock was arguably between the mid-sixties and the mid-seventies, when it  aligned itself with the [[hippie]] movement and became an important medium for expressing radical ideas. Cities such as [[San Francisco]], [[Denver]], [[New York]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] became centers for the folk rock culture, playing on their central locations among the original folk circuits. The "unplugged" and simplified sound of the music reflected the genre's connection to a critical view of a technological and consumerist society. Unlike pop music's escapist lyrics, arguably a fantasy distraction from the problems in life, folk artists attempted to communicate concerns for peace, global awareness, and other touchstones of the era.

Some artists, originally produced with a harder edged rock sound, found the ability to communicate more easily and  felt more genuine in this method of delivery. In this category was [[Cat Stevens]], in [[London]], who began, much like the Byrds in the United States, but toned down the sound more frequently, with acoustic instruments, performing songs that contained concern for the environment, war, and the future of the world in general.

==Subgenres==
===Country folk===
{{main|Country folk}}
Arising originally from the folk-influenced music of Bob Dylan and earlier musicians, the folk revivalist vocal combo, and the rock music of the [[British Invasion]]; folk rock later incorporated elements of [[country music]], drawing on [[Hank Williams]] and others. This success in the country folk blend led to pioneering records for 1960s folk singers such as [[John Denver]] and [[Judy Collins]].

===Electric folk===
{{main|Electric folk}}
Electric folk is the name given to the form of folk rock pioneered in [[England]] from the late 1960s, by the band [[Fairport Convention]].<ref>M. Brocken, ''The British Folk Revival 1944-2002'' (Ashgate, Aldershot, 2003), p. 97.</ref> It uses traditional music, and compositions in a traditional style, played on a combination of rock and traditional instruments.<ref>B. Sweers, ''Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), pp. 21-5.</ref> It was most significant in the 1970s, when it was also taken up by groups such as [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]], [[Steeleye Span]] and the [[Albion Band]].<ref>B. Sweers, ''Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), pp. 84, 97 and 103-5.</ref> It was rapidly adopted and developed in the surrounding Celtic cultures of [[Brittany]], where it was pioneered by [[Alan Stivell]] and bands like [[Malicorne (band)|Malicorne]]; in [[Ireland]] by groups such as [[Horslips]]; and also in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and the [[Isle of Man]] and [[Cornwall]], to produce [[Celtic rock]] and its derivates.<ref> J. S. Sawyers, ''Celtic Music: A Complete Guide'' (Da Capo Press, 2001), p. 1-12.</ref> It has been influential in those parts of the world with close cultural connections to Britain, such as the US and Canada and gave rise to the sub-genre of [[Medieval folk rock]] and the fusion genres of [[folk punk]] and [[folk metal]].<ref>B. Sweers, ''Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), pp. 240-57.</ref> By the 1980s the genre was in steep decline in popularity, but has survived and revived in significance as part of a more general folk resurgence since the 1990s.

===Medieval folk rock===
{{main|Medieval folk rock}}
Medieval folk rock developed as a sub-genre of electric folk from about 1970 as performers, particularly in England, Germany and Brittany, adopted [[Medieval music|medieval]] and [[renaissance music]] as a basis for their music, in contrast to the early modern and nineteenth century [[ballads]] that dominated the output of Fairport Convention. This followed the trend explored by Steeleye Span, and exemplified by their 1972 album ''[[Below the Salt]]''. Acts in this area included [[Gryphon (band)|Gryphon]], [[Gentle Giant]] and [[Third Ear Band]].<ref>E. Macan, ''Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture'' (Oxford University Press, 1997), p. 135.</ref> In Germany [[Ougenweide]], originally formed in 1970 as an acoustic folk group, opted to draw exclusively on [[High German]] medieval music when they electrified, setting the agenda for future German electric folk.<ref>S. Winick, ''Dirty Linen'', 128 (February/March 2007).</ref> In Brittany, as part of the [[Celtic rock]] movement, medieval music was focused on by bands like Ripaille from 1977 and Saga de Ragnar Lodbrock from 1979.<ref>D. E. Asbj<U+00F8>rnsen, ''Scented Gardens Of The Mind'', http://sgm.paullee.ru/sgm-fr.htm, retrieved 29/01/09.</ref> However, by the end of the 1970s almost all of these performers had either disbanded or moved, like Gentle Giant and Gryphon, into the developing area of [[progressive rock]].<ref>C. Snider, ''The Strawberry Bricks Guide to Progressive Rock'' (Lulu.com, 2008), pp. 183-4.</ref> In the 1990s, as part of the wider resurgence of folk music in general, new medieval folk rock acts began to appear, including the [[Richie Blackmore]] project [[Blackmore's Night]], German bands such as [[In Extremo]] and English bands like [[Circulus]].<ref>D.

==Regional varieties==
{{Expand}}

===British Isles and Scandinavia===
Many performers influenced by Celtic music can be found in the nations of the islands with a strong Celtic past.  [[Dropkick Murphys]] draw on [[Music of Ireland#Traditional music|traditional Irish music]] and [[punk rock]]. There are others in Wales, Cornwall and Scotland e.g. [[Runrig]], the [[Battlefield Band]].

From [[Norway]], [[G<U+00E5>te]] combines Norwegian folk songs (Stev) and rock.

===South-Eastern Europe===
;Hungary
In [[Hungary]] the fusion of rock and folk music began in 1965, when the band Ill<U+00E9>s introduced Hungarian folk music elements into their beat-influenced music, winning everything which could be won in that time at festivals, TV contests, etc. Their rock-musical ''Istv<U+00E1>n, a kir<U+00E1>ly'' ([[Stephen I of Hungary]]), released in 1980 contains strong folk-influences and traditional folk songs as well. The film made based on the rock-opera was one of the biggest box-office hits in 1980. Later on bands like [http://www.barbaro.hu Barbaro], G<U+00E9>pfolkl<U+00F3>r, Kormor<U+00E1>n and Drums have developed a distinctive sound using odd rhythms, progressive rock, Hungarian and Greek/Bulgarian/etc. folk traditions. 

;Romania
In [[Romania]] [[Transsylvania Phoenix]] (known in Romania simply as ''Phoenix''), founded in 1962, introduced significant folk elements into their rock music around 1972 in an unsuccessful attempt to compromise with government repression of rock music. The attempt failed, and they ended up in exile during much of the [[Nicolae Ceau<U+015F>escu|Ceau<U+015F>escu]] era, but much of their music still retains a folk rock sound. The present-day bands [[Spitalul de Urgen<U+0163><U+0103>]] (Romanian) and [[Zdob <U+015F>i Zdub]] ([[Moldova]]) also both merge folk and rock. 

;Yugoslavia and its successor states
In [[SFR Yugoslavia]] a great number of (mostly 1970s progressive rock) bands incorporated folk music elements into their sound. [[Korni Grupa]], [[YU grupa]] and [[S Vremena Na Vreme]] were  pioneers in incorporating [[Balkan]] folk music elements into rock on the Yugoslav scene, and were followed by [[Smak]], [[Leb i Sol]] and [[Dah (band)|Dah]].

In the mid 1970s emerged the band [[Bijelo Dugme]], who had huge success with their fusion of hard rock and folk music; however at the beginning of 1980s Bijelo Dugme switched to [[New Wave music|New Wave]], and in the late 1980s to [[pop rock]], but their last few releases also featured folk music elements. Late Bijelo Dugme albums influenced a number of pop rock/folk rock bands, mostly from [[Sarajevo]]: [[Crvena Jabuka]], [[Plavi Orkestar]], [[Dino Merlin|Merlin]], [[Valentino (band)|Valentino]] and [[Hari Mata Hari]]. [[Singer<U+2013>songwriter]] [[<U+0110>or<U+0111>e Bala<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]] incorporated elements of folk music of [[Vojvodina]] into a number of his songs, while some of his albums, like ''Naposletku'' and ''Rani mraz'', were completely folk rock-oriented. Another notable act whose music featured a combination of rock and Vojvodina folk music were the band [[Garavi Sokak]]. 

Some hard rock/heavy metal bands, like [[Vatreni Poljubac]], [[Divlje Jagode]] and [[Griva]] incorporated folk music elements into some of their songs, Divlje Jagode during their 1970s hard rock era, and Griva after their third album ''Griva''. The band [[Galija]] incorporated some folk music elements into their music during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and in 1999 released the album ''Ju<U+017E>nja<U+010D>ka uteha'' with covers of [[Serbia]]n traditional songs. During the 1990s Serbian band [[Orthodox Celts]] emerged. They saw major success with their [[Irish folk]]/[[Celtic rock]] sound, influencing a number of younger bands, most notably [[Tir na n'Og]] and [[Irish Stew of Sindidun]].

===The Soviet Union and its successor states===
[[Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]] produced a large amount of folk music, which was often mixed with modern music styles. Bands like [[Pesneri]] ([[Music of Belarus|Belarussian]]), [[Melnitsa]] (Russian), [[Yalla]] ([[Music of Uzbekistan|Uzbek]]) and others combined rock, pop and traditional music. 

===Turkey===
Turkey, during the 1970s and 1980s, also sustained a vibrant folk rock scene, drawing inspirations from diverse ethnic elements of [[Anatolia]], the [[Balkans]], Eurasia and the [[Black Sea]] region and thriving in a culture of intense political strife, with musicians in [[nationalist]] and [[Marxist]] camps. ''See [[Anatolian rock]] and [[Music of Turkey]]''.

===Italy and Spain===

It is difficult to define the boundaries between [[Folk music|folk]] and [[ethnic music]] in [[Italy]], because of its geographic position and its history. The folk side was founded by the Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare at the end of 1960s. The Nuovo Canzoniere Italiano was characterized by musical search and a strong political commitment. In Italy many songwriters imported American models, such as ''Folk beat n. 1'' by [[Francesco Guccini]] or to [[Edoardo Bennato]], who mixes [[Country music|country]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[tarantella]].
[[File:Modena City Ramblers.jpg|thumb|270px|right|The [[Modena City Ramblers]], in 2009<br />Combining genres and performing ''[[patchanka|Celtic patchanka]]'']]

Folk rock roots can be found in two Italian songwriters: [[Fabrizio De Andr<U+00E9>]] and [[Angelo Branduardi]]. In 1984, Fabrizio De Andr<U+00E9> published the LP ''Creuza de ma'', in [[Genoa|Genoese]] dialect (an ancient dialect, with ancient and obsolete words, imported from Arabian, with linguistic difficulties among the same Genoese). De Andr<U+00E8> used [[musical instruments]] from [[Bosporus]] to [[Gibraltar]]: [[oud]], andalusian guitar, [[bag pipe|Macedonian bag pipe]], [[flute]], Turkish shannaj, [[lute]], [[bouzouki|Greek bouzuki]] and [[mandolin|neapolitan mandolin]]. Brandurdi is a classical musician whose first LP ''Branduardi '74'' is near to progressive sound, later he approaches to medieval and rinascimental and Celtic music. In 1985 he sang William Butler Yeats poetry. The violin, the [[harp]], the [[sitar]], the [[banjo]] and the [[lute]] are accompanied by [[bass guitar|electric bass]] and drums. Later he substituted violin with electric violin. 
  
In 1982 [[Lou Dalfin]] formed an [[occitania]]n group which performed traditional music with traditional instruments: [[ghironda]], [[accordion]] and [[organetto]], [[violin]], [[flute]], boha and [[bag pipe]] and singing in occitanian language. A new line-up of the band in 1990 played folk, jazz and rock using [[Bass guitar|electric bass]], drums, [[electric guitar]], [[electronic keyboard|keyboard]] and [[saxophone]]. In 1988 Gigi Camedda, Gino Marielli and Andrea Parodi founded Tazenda, an Italian ethno-folk-rock group which uses a [[launeddas]] (the oldest reed instruments of the [[Mediterranean]]), the sampled ''"[[Music of Sardinia#Polyphonic singing|canti a tenore]]"'', the diatonic accordions are mixed with electric guitars and drums and harmonicas.

[[The Gang]] were formed in 1984 as a [[punk rock|punk]] group, inspired by [[The Clash]], but in 1990 they began to sing about Italian political and social situation and they moved away from punk-style electric guitar and used acoustic twelve string guitar, violin, accordion, [[harmonica]], and [[flute]]s. In 2004, after two rock discs, Gang recorded ''Nel tempo e oltre cantando insieme'' with La Macina, band of musical search from [[Marche]] led by Gastone Pietrucci. Traditional songs and Gang's songs were revised rearranged: an example of fusion between rock and popular tradition.

In 1991 some performers from Emilia-Romagna founded [[Modena City Ramblers]], which blends the  ''[[Combat Rock]]'' musical style ([[The Clash]]) with folk, traditional Irish music, political songs (''Contessa'') and partisans' songs (''Fischia il vento'' and ''Bella Ciao''   Later M.C.R. used a world music sound, and blended in rock, punk, [[tape loop]]s and samples, creating a new genre called ''[[patchanka|Celtic patchanka]]''. Many groups were influenced by M.C.R.: [[Casa del Vento]], [[Fiamma Fumana]] led by Alberto Cottica (electronic folk); Caravane de Ville of Giovanni Rubbiani; Ductia of Massimo Giuntini; Paulem and La strana famiglia led by Luciano Gaetani; and Cisco (former singer of M.C.R.) now a guitarist and drummer.

;Spain
[[File:seivane1.jpg|right|thumb|Susana Seivane on stage at [[Lorient]], Brittany, in 2004]]
Other fusions of folk and rock include [[New Flamenco]] ([[Spain]]), the pop-oriented forms of North African [[ra<U+00EF>]] music. Spain has produced two folk-rock-bagpipers, [[Susana Seivane]] from Galicia and [[Hevia]], who mix traditional with modern dance tunes. [[Triquel]] is another Spanish [[Celtic rock]] band that combines [[rock music]] with Celtic folk roots.

===Outside Europe===

;Canada
Canadian folk rock is particularly, although not exclusively, associated with [[Celtic folk]] traditions. Bands such as [[Figgy Duff]], [[Wonderful Grand Band]] and [[Spirit of the West]] were early pioneers in the Canadian tradition of Celtic-influenced rock, and were later followed by acts such as [[Crash Test Dummies]], [[Great Big Sea]], [[The Mahones]], [[The Dukhs]], [[Jimmy George (band)|Jimmy George]], [[Rawlins Cross]], [[Captain Tractor]], [[Mudmen]], and [[Michou]]

Other notable Canadian folk rock acts include [[The Band]], [[The Weakerthans]], [[Saint John and the Revelations]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1T4RNWN_enGB254GB256&q=Saint+John+and+the+Revelations+canada|title=Search results for Saint John and the Revelations|accessdate=01 December 2009}}</ref>  [[The Grapes of Wrath (band)|The Grapes of Wrath]], [[Attack in Black]], [[Lava Hay]], [[The Waltons (Canadian band)|The Waltons]], [[Kashtin]], [[Great Lake Swimmers]], [[Beau Dommage]] and [[Garolou]] from Quebec, as well as singer-songwriters such as [[Neil Young]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Gordon Lightfoot]], [[Bruce Cockburn]], [[David Wiffen]] and [[Stan Rogers]].

;South Asia and East Asia

Indian folk rock is still in the infant stage.Though some of the songs rendered by bands [[Indian Ocean]]<ref>[http://www.goldstar.com/events/new-york-city-ny/indian-ocean.html]</ref>,[[Raghu dixit]]<ref>[http://raghudixit.com/about/]</ref> are popular,it is yet to hit the masses.

[[Manila Sound]] is a sub-genre popular in the [[Philippines]] (notably in [[Manila]] during the 1970's which combined elements of [[Filipino folk music]] and [[Rock and roll]] using [[Taglish]] (mixed [[English language|English]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]). Notable musicians using this music include [[Freddie Aguilar]], [[Sharon Cuneta]], the [[Apo Hiking Society]], [[VST & Co.]], [[Florante]], [[Rey Valera]], [[Rico J. Puno]], and [[Ryan Cayabyab]].
