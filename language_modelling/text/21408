'''''Uncontrolled'''''  is the 10th studio album by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[pop music|pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] musician [[Namie Amuro]], released on June 27, 2012.<ref name="Neowing">{{cite web | url=http://www.neowing.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=AVCD-38522 | title=<nowiki>[CD]Uncontrolled [CD+DVD/<U+30B8><U+30E3><U+30B1><U+30C3><U+30C8>A] / <U+5B89><U+5BA4><U+5948><U+7F8E><U+6075></nowiki> |work=Neowing | language=Japanese | accessdate=May 25, 2012}}</ref> The album was released just before her 20th anniversary concerts <U+2014> one in Okinawa in September, and seven across Japan in November and December 2012. The album consists mostly of songs sung in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], however this was the first album of Amuro's to feature several songs sung entirely in [[English language|English]].

The album spent three weeks at number one on [[Oricon]]'s albums chart, making ''Uncontrolled'' the second album of Amuro's to do this after ''[[Best Fiction]]'' (2008) spent six weeks at number one. The album was certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan]]. This is her fifth consecutive number one album since 2007, and her sixth consecutive double platinum album since 2005.

== Background and development ==
''Uncontrolled'' is Amuro's first original studio album since 2009's ''[[Past Future|Past < Future]]'', and follows her collaboration compilation album ''[[Checkmate! (Namie Amuro album)|Checkmate!]]'', released in 2011. Unlike ''Past < Future'', which was released after only one physical single, ''Uncontrolled'' is a compilation of nine tracks released on four singles released between 2010 and 2012, as well as four new tracks. Despite seven of the songs being released as singles between 2010 and 2011, concrete plans for an album only started at the beginning of 2012.<ref name="BillboardInterview">{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard-japan.com/special/detail/52 | title=<U+5B89><U+5BA4><U+5948><U+7F8E><U+6075> <U+300E>Uncontrolled<U+300F><U+30A4><U+30F3><U+30BF><U+30D3><U+30E5><U+30FC> | trans_title=Namie Amuro Uncontrolled Interview |publisher=Billboard Japan |work=Kanako Hayagawa | language=Japanese | year=2012 | accessdate=July 4, 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68uD9rtMv |archivedate=July 4, 2012}}</ref> The album was created as a collection of what Amuro thought were good songs that she wanted to sing, as opposed to an album based around a concept.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/interview/page/69/ | title=<U+5B89><U+5BA4><U+5948><U+7F8E><U+6075><U+300E><U+5F37><U+304F><U+3066><U+30AD><U+30E5><U+30FC><U+30C8><U+3067><U+30AB><U+30C3><U+30B3><U+3044><U+3044><U+5973><U+6027><U+FF1D><U+6B4C><U+624B><U+30FB><U+5B89><U+5BA4><U+5948><U+7F8E><U+6075><U+3068><U+3057><U+3066><U+8868><U+73FE><U+3057><U+305F><U+3044><U+FF01><U+300F> | trans_title=Namie Amuro: I want to express strong, cute and cool in my works as Namie Amuro! |publisher=Oricon |work=Kanako Hayagawa | language=Japanese | date=June 27, 2012 | accessdate=July 2, 2012}}</ref>

Most of the album was recorded in [[Tokyo]], at Prime Sound Studio Form, with additional recording at Azabu O Studio, Avex Studio and Bunkamura Studio. Once exception is the song "Let's Go," which was recorded at [[Record Plant]] in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name="booklet"/> Amuro had previously recorded at Record Plant in the 1990s, on her albums ''[[Sweet 19 Blues]]'' (1996), ''[[Concentration 20]]'' (1997) and ''[[Genius 2000]]'' (2000).

== Writing and production ==

Five of the songs on the album are sung entirely in English <U+2014> three new tracks "In the Spotlight (Tokyo)," "Hot Girls" and "Only You," as well as English versions of the songs from her preceding single "[[Go Round / Yeah-Oh!]]." During an interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Japan]]'', Amuro stated that the tracks were not sung in English with overseas audiences in mind. She chose to sing them in English because she thought the English lyrics suited the songs, and because she felt singing in English distanced the song from the "ties of language" that singing in Japanese would not.<ref name="BillboardInterview"/>

The album's songs featured seven different sound producers, with long time collaborator [[Nao'ymt]] and new collaborator [[T-SK]] producing four songs each. Nao'ymt, who had worked with Amuro since 2005 on songs such as "[[Baby Don't Cry (Namie Amuro song)|Baby Don't Cry]]" and "[[Hide and Seek (Namie Amuro song)|Hide and Seek]]," worked on four tracks, "Break It," "Get Myself Back," "Fight Together" and "Tempest."<ref name="booklet"/> T-SK, who began working with Amuro in 2011, produced "Go Round," "Let's Go," "Love Story" and "Yeah-Oh" <U+2014> all songs written by [[Australia]]n band [[The Nervo Twins]].<ref name="booklet"/> In addition to the songs with the Nervo Twins, Amuro worked on three additional songs with the Nervo Twins' music publishing company, the [[Sweden]] based [[Razor Boy Music Publishing]]. "In the Spotlight (Tokyo)," "Hot Girls" and "Only You" were produced by Henrik Nordenback, Michael Smith and [[Peter Mansson]] respectively.<ref name="booklet"/> Of the seven songs featuring Razor Boy Music Publishing artists, five were sung entirely in English. Of these songs, Tiger wrote Japanese lyrics for "Let's Go" "Love Story,"<ref name="booklet"/> and the Japanese versions of "[[Go Round / Yeah-Oh!]]" that appear on the single were written by [[:ja:AILI|Aili]] and [[Double (singer)|Double]] respectively.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jbook.co.jp/p/p.aspx/4308007/s/ | title=<U+FF27><U+FF4F><U+3000><U+FF32><U+FF4F><U+FF55><U+FF4E><U+FF44><U+3010><U+FF23><U+FF24><U+FF0B><U+FF24><U+FF36><U+FF24><U+3011> |work=JBook | language=Japanese | accessdate=July 14, 2012}}</ref>

The remaining two producers are also previous collaborators of Amuro's: T. Kura ("[[Funky Town (Namie Amuro song)|Funky Town]]" (2007), "[[60s 70s 80s|New Look]]" (2008)) worked with Michoco on the track "Sit! Stay! Wait! Down!," while Japanese DJ [[Shinichi Osawa]] ("[[60s 70s 80s|What a Feeling]]" (2008)) produced "Naked" with [[M-Flo]] member [[Verbal (rapper)|Verbal]] writing the lyrics.<ref name="booklet"/>

Yoshiki Aoyuki of ''Listen Japan'' agreed with the album's title, feeling that the music felt very unrestrained. He was impressed that despite many of the songs being dance music, there was a lot of variety on the album. He likened the "euro-disco" sound of "Only You" to the sound of [[Kylie Minogue]].<ref name="listenjpReview">{{cite web |url=http://listen.jp/store/diskreview_37344.htm |title=<U+65B0><U+8B5C><U+30EC><U+30D3><U+30E5><U+30FC> > <U+5B89><U+5BA4><U+5948><U+7F8E><U+6075><U+FF0F><U+FF35><U+FF4E><U+FF43><U+FF4F><U+FF4E><U+FF54><U+FF52><U+FF4F><U+FF4C><U+FF4C><U+FF45><U+FF44> |trans_title=New Record Review: Namie Amuro/Uncontrolled |author=Yoshiki Aoyuki |publisher=listen.jp |language=Japanese |year=2012 |accessdate=June 2, 2012}}</ref>

Tetsu Hiraga of ''Hot Express'' was extremely impressed by the album, in particular "In the Spotlight (Tokyo)," calling it "the best kind of electro pop." He felt that every song had a similar impressive impact.<ref name="HotExpressReview"/> He described the first single, "Break It," as "Amuro's voice dancing over a tricky guitar and bass." He found her "agressively shouted singing" very exciting.<ref name="BI/GMB-HotExpress">{{cite web |url=http://www.hotexpress.co.jp/review/2732/ |title=Break It / Get Myself Back (review)|author=Tetsuo Hiraga |publisher=Hot Express |language=Japanese |year=2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2012}}</ref> He enjoyed the mis-match in the song "Sit!

''[[Rolling Stone]] Japan'' author Kazumi Namba felt the album was "consistent and unshaking," and called the album "approximately Western" and noted how it followed current global trends in global pop music. He called the English recordings "ambitious," and was surprised at how different the work was to her roots in 1990s [[J-pop]]. He, however, rated the album at three stars out of five.<ref name="RollingStone">{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstonejapan.com/reviews/archive/uncontrolled/ |title=<U+30EC><U+30F4><U+30E5><U+30FC>REVIEW <U+5B89><U+5BA4><U+5948><U+7F8E><U+6075><U+300E>Uncontrolled<U+300F> |author=Kazumi Namba |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] Japan |language=Japanese |accessdate=July 10, 2012}}</ref>
