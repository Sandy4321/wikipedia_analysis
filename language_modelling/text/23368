He is a holder of the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]], the Soviet Union's highest award.

==Life and death==
Nikonov was born on December&nbsp;18, 1920, into an ethnically Russian peasant family in the village of [[Vasilyevka, Stavropolsky District, Samara Oblast|Vasilyevka]] in what is now [[Stavropolsky District]] of [[Samara Oblast]].{{efn|name=Stavropol Region}} He joined the navy in 1939 and served as a torpedo electrician on the [[destroyer leader]] [[Leningrad class destroyer|''Minsk'']] attached to the Soviet [[Baltic Fleet]].

Following the 1941 German [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], Nikonov and many other Baltic Fleet sailors were deployed as emergency [[Naval Infantry (Russia)|naval infantry]].

Nikonov fought in the defense of [[Tallinn]] (August 5<U+2013>28, 1941), the main base of the Baltic Fleet. While engaged in reconnaissance near the town of [[Keila]] on August&nbsp;19, he was seriously wounded and captured. Despite being tortured, Nikonov refused to give his captors any military information, for which the Germans doused him with gasoline and burned him alive.

On April&nbsp;19, 1943, Baltic Fleet commander Vice<U+2013>Admiral [[Vladimir Tributs]] ordered that Torpedo Electrician Yevgeny Nikonov forever be listed as a member of the ''Minsk'''s active crew. (This tradition continues today; although the ''Minsk'' was long ago scrapped, Yevgeny Nikonov is always listed on the active personnel roster of a Baltic Fleet training unit.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baltflot.vif20.ru/moriaki_geroi.html|title=<U+041C><U+043E><U+0440><U+044F><U+043A><U+0438>-<U+0431><U+0430><U+043B><U+0442><U+0438><U+0439><U+0446><U+044B>, <U+0437><U+0430><U+043D><U+0435><U+0441><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+044B><U+0435> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0432><U+0435><U+0447><U+043D><U+043E> <U+0432> <U+0441><U+043F><U+0438><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438> <U+043A><U+043E><U+0440><U+0430><U+0431><U+043B><U+0435><U+0439> <U+0438> <U+0447><U+0430><U+0441><U+0442><U+0435><U+0439> <U+0434><U+0432><U+0430><U+0436><U+0434><U+044B> <U+041A><U+0440><U+0430><U+0441><U+043D><U+043E><U+0437><U+043D><U+0430><U+043C><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+0411><U+0430><U+043B><U+0442><U+0438><U+0439><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+0444><U+043B><U+043E><U+0442><U+0430>|trans_title=Baltic Fleet sailors, entered forever onto the lists of ships and twice part of the Red Banner Baltic Fleet|author=Anna Ivanova|date=|work=The Baltic Fleet|accessdate=April 13, 2011}}</ref>

Nikonov was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union on September&nbsp;3, 1957.

==Burials==
Nikonov was originally buried on a farm in [[Harku]]. On March&nbsp;19, 1951, the Tallinn City Council decided to rename a street in Nikonov's honor. The same decree granted a request by Baltic Fleet Command for land in the [[Kadriorg]] district to construct a monument to Nikonov.

Soon after, Nikonov's remains were ceremoniously reinterred in a picturesque location in Tallinn park, on the hill of Terra Mariana{{cn|date=May 2011}}, and a monument was erected. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the monument was destroyed and the grave desecrated.

On March&nbsp;2, 1992, Nikonov was again reinterred, in his home town of Vasilyevka in Russia. According to some sources, when the attempt was made to disinter Nikonov's remains for reburial in Russia, his remains were missing&nbsp;<U+2013> they had been taken by Estonian nationalists, and were then offered in exchange for information about the burial location of some men of the [[20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian)]] (a unit of Estonians who had fought for the Germans against the Soviets) who had been shot after the Soviets reoccupied Tallinn in 1944. So the reburial delegation from [[Tolyatti]] just filled the coffin with some earth from around Nikonov's grave and returned with that to Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.relga.ru/Environ/WebObjects/tgu-www.woa/wa/Main?searchPattern=<U+0422><U+043E><U+043B><U+044C><U+044F><U+0442><U+0442><U+0438>&textid=343&level1=main&level2=articles|title=<U+041D><U+043E><U+0448><U+0430> <U+0431><U+0435><U+0441><U+0441><U+043C><U+0435><U+0440><U+0442><U+0438><U+044F>|trans_title=The burden of immortality|author=Sergei Melnik|date=March 29, 2005|work=Relga|accessdate=April 13, 2011}}</ref>
