'''''Age of Empires''''' is a series of [[personal computer game|computer games]] developed by [[Ensemble Studios]] and published by [[Microsoft Studios (game studio)|Microsoft Studios]]. The first title of the series was ''[[Age of Empires (video game)|Age of Empires]]'', released in 1997. Since then, seven titles and three spin-offs have been released. The titles are historical [[real-time strategy]] games, and their gameplay revolves around two main game modes: Single player and [[campaign (gaming)|campaign]]. They competed with another popular strategy series, ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'', and are set amidst historical events. ''[[Age of Empires (video game)|Age of Empires]]'' focused on events in [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], spanning from the [[Stone Age]] to the [[Iron Age]]; the expansion game explored the formation and expansion of the [[Roman Empire]]. The sequel, ''[[Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings]]'', was set in the [[Middle Ages]], while its expansion focused partially on the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest of Mexico]]. The subsequent three games of ''[[Age of Empires III]]'' explored the [[early modern period]], when [[European colonization of the Americas|Europe was colonizing the Americas]] and several [[Asia]]n nations were on the decline. The newest installment, ''[[Age of Empires Online]]'', takes a different approach as a free-to-play online game utilizing [[Games for Windows Live]]. A [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] game, ''[[Age of Mythology]]'', was set in the same period as the original ''Age of Empires'', but focused on mythological elements of [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]], and [[Norse mythology]].

The ''Age of Empires'' series has been a commercial success, selling over 20&nbsp;million copies.<ref name="Age Series Passes 20 Million Units Sold Mark"/> The popularity and quality of the games has earned Ensemble Studios a strong reputation in real-time strategy gaming. Ensemble collaborated with [[Big Huge Games]] on ''[[Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties]]''. Critics have credited part of the success of the series to its [[history|historical]] theme and fair play; the [[artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence (AI)]] players fight with less "cheating" than in many of the series' competitors.<ref name="Dave"/>

==Games==
The games in the series focus on historical events throughout time. ''[[Age of Empires (video game)|Age of Empires]]'' covers the events between the [[Stone Age]] and the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]], in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. Its expansion, ''[[Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome|The Rise of Rome]]'', follows the formation and rise of the [[Roman Empire]]. ''[[Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings|The Age of Kings]]'' and its [[Age of Empires: The Age of Kings|Nintendo DS spin-off]] follow Europe and Asia through the [[Middle Ages]]. ''The Age of Kings''{{'}} expansion pack, ''[[Age of Empires II: The Conquerors|The Conquerors]]'', is set during the same period, but also includes scenarios about the [[Spain|Spanish]] conquest of [[Mexico]], [[El Cid]], and [[Attila the Hun]]. ''[[Age of Empires III]]'' and its first expansion, ''[[Age of Empires III: The WarChiefs|The WarChiefs]]'', take place during the [[European colonization of the Americas]]. Its second expansion, ''[[Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties|The Asian Dynasties]]'', follows the rise of [[Asia]] in the same period. [[Age of Empires Online]] focuses on the [[Greeks|Greek]] and Egyptian civilizations. The series' spin-off, ''[[Age of Mythology]]'', and its expansion pack, ''[[Age of Mythology: The Titans|The Titans]]'', are set during the [[Bronze Age]], but focus on [[mythology]] as their themes, rather than history.

The expansion pack, ''The Rise of Rome'', published by [[Microsoft]] on October 31, 1998, introduced new features and four new civilizations, including the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Although the two games had contained many [[software bug]]s, [[patch (computing)|patches]] resolved many of the problems.<ref name="Age of Empires"/><ref name="Age of Empires Downloads"/>

''Age of Empires'' was generally well received, despite some highly negative reviews. [[GameSpot]] criticized a confused design, while ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' praised the game as strong in single and multiplayer.<ref name="AoE1MC"/> The [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences]] named ''Age of Empires'' the 1998 "Computer Strategy Game of the Year."<ref name="Computer Strategy Game of the Year"/> For several years, the game remained high on the sales charts, with over three million units sold by 2000.<ref name="AoESales"/> ''The Rise of Rome'' was not as popular: it had only sold one million units in 2000,<ref name=AoESales /> and attained 80% as an [[:Category:Video game review aggregators|aggregate]] score from [[Game Rankings]].<ref name="RoRGR"/>

It added new units and five new civilizations, including two [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations; the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and the [[Aztec]].<ref name="Age II: The Conquerors - The Mayans Showcase"/>  ''The Age of Kings'' was a bigger critical success than the first two games, with Game Rankings and [[Metacritic]] scores of 92%.<ref name="AoKGR"/><ref name="AoKMC"/> Microsoft shipped out more than two million copies to retailers, and the game received numerous awards and accolades.<ref name="AoKSales"/> Critics agreed that ''The Conquerors'' expanded well on ''The Age of Kings'', though issues of unbalanced gameplay were raised.<ref name="AoCMC"/> ''The Age of Kings'' and ''The Conquerors'' won the 2000 and 2001 "Computer Strategy Game of the Year" awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, respectively.<ref name="Computer Strategy Game of the Year1"/><ref name="PC Strategy"/>

''Age of Empires III'', released on October 18, 2005, was built on an improved version of the ''Age of Mythology'' game engine with the most significant changes being the updated graphics engine and the inclusion of the [[Havok (software)|Havok physics]] [[middleware]] engine.<ref name="Age of Empires III"/><ref name="Havok in Age of Empires"/> The game is set in the period between [[Early modern period|1421 and 1850]], and players can choose one of eight European nations. The game introduced a large number of features, such as [[Age of Empires III#Home Cities|home cities]]. Described by Ensemble Studios as "an important support system to your efforts in the New World," home cities helped provide the player with resources, equipment, troops, and upgrades. They could be used across multiple games, and upgraded after each battle; it was compared to a [[role-playing game]] character by Ensemble Studios.<ref name="Home City"/> The first expansion to ''Age of Empires III'', ''The WarChiefs'', was released October 17, 2006. Most gameplay changes in the expansion pack were small, but it introduced three new civilizations, with a focus on [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].<ref name="Age of Empires III: The WarChiefs: Ensemble's lead designer Sandy Petersen answers our questions"/> Most notable was the introduction of the [[Age of Empires III: The WarChiefs#WarChiefs|WarChief]] unit.<ref name="Age of Empires III: The WarChiefs (PC) Preview"/> The second expansion, ''The Asian Dynasties'', went on sale October 23, 2007.

Several [[special edition|collectors' editions]] of ''Age of Empires III'' included a [[hardcover]] [[artbook]]. The last page of the artbook has a pictorial depiction of the series; the [[Roman numeral]]s below each panel range from I to V, indicating the series would include an ''Age of Empires IV'' and ''Age of Empires V''. Ensemble Studios employee [[Sandy Petersen]] said the image "was total speculation on [their] part."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aoe3.heavengames.com/cgi-bin/forums/display.cgi?action=st&fn=1&tn=25506&st=181#post182 |title= Age 4 and 5?!?|publisher=HeavenGames|work=Age of Empires III Heaven|author=Botolf|date=2006-05-03|accessdate=2008-06-17}}</ref>

''Age of Mythology'' shared many elements of gameplay with the main series,<ref name="Age of Mythology review"/> and was considered a part of the series, despite its different focus.<ref name="Age of Mythology"/><ref name="Microsoft Age of Mythology"/> The campaign in ''Age of Mythology'' tells the story of an [[Atlantis|Atlantean]], [[Arkantos]], and his quest to find why his people are out of favor with [[Poseidon]].<ref name="Age of Mythology review2"/> Microsoft published the game on October 30, 2002,<ref name="Age of Mythology Info"/> and its expansion, ''The Titans'', on October 21, 2003.<ref name="Age of Mythology: The Titans Info"/> ''The Titans'' featured the Atlanteans as a new civilization.<ref name="Age of Mythology:The Titans"/> Its campaign is shorter than previous expansions, and centers on [[Castor and Pollux|Kastor]], son of Arkantos, who falls for the lies of the [[titan (mythology)|titans]] and frees them from [[Tartarus]].<ref name="Age of Mythology: The Titans review"/> ''Age of Mythology'' sold more than one million units in four months.<ref name="AoMSales"/> It scored 89% on Game Rankings and Metacritic.<ref name="AoMGR"/><ref name="AoMMC"/> ''The Titans'' failed to equal the sales success of ''Age of Mythology'', although critics rated it highly.<ref name="TTGR"/><ref name="TTMC"/>

[[Backbone Entertainment]] developed ''[[Age of Empires: The Age of Kings]]'' as a [[turn-based strategy|turn-based]] game for the [[Nintendo DS]]. [[Majesco]] published the game on February 14, 2006. It is similar to other turn-based games, such as ''[[Advance Wars]]'', but with a gameplay based on its [[Personal computer|PC]] [[Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings|counterpart]].<ref name="Age of Empires: Age of Kings"/>  ''Age of Empires: The Age of Kings'' scored 80% on Game Rankings and Metacritic.<ref name="AoKDSGR"/><ref name="AoKDSMC"/> [[Konami]] brought a game of the same title to the [[PlayStation 2]] around five years earlier than the DS version, but the game had little promotion, and sold poorly.<ref name="PS2prev"/>

On August 16, 2010, Microsoft announced ''[[Age of Empires Online]]'', a free-to-play Games for Windows Live online game, developed in collaboration with [[Robot Entertainment]]. It features Free-to-play experiences via [[Games for Windows LIVE]] as well as: A persistent online capital city that lives and grows even when you<U+2019>re offline, Cooperative multiplayer quests, trading and a level-based system that lets you progress at your own pace, Fun, approachable style and storylines<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2010/aug10/08-16msgamescompcpr.mspx|title=Microsoft Heralds a New Age of Gaming With "Age of Empires Online"|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|author=[[Microsoft]]|date=August 16, 2010|accessdate=2010-08-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100819044643/http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2010/aug10/08-16MSGamescomPCPR.mspx| archivedate= 19 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Development==
===Historical elements===
The [[game development|development]] phases of the ''Age of Empires'' games were similar in several ways. Due to the games being based on historical events, the team often had to do large amounts of research.<ref name=BehindBruce /> However, the research was not in depth, which, according to ''Age of Empires'' designer [[Bruce Shelley]], is "a good idea for most entertainment products."<ref name=BehindBruce /> Shelley also said that Ensemble Studios took most of the reference material from children's sections at [[library|libraries]]. He pointed out the goal was for the players of the game to have fun, "not [its] designers or researchers."<ref name="BehindBruce"/> At the [[Games Convention#International Games Convention Developers Conference|Games Convention Developers Conference]] in 2007, Shelley continued with this thought and explained that the success of the series laid in "making a game which appealed to both the casual and hardcore gamer."<ref name=GC07 /> Shelley also remarked the ''Age of Empires'' games were not about history in itself, but rather "about the human experience;"<ref name=GC07 /> they focused not simply on what humans had done but on what they could do in the future such as "going into space."<ref name="GC07"/> Ensemble Studios developed ''Age of Mythology'' in a different way than the previous two games. The team had worried they "couldn't get away" with a third historical-based game, and chose mythology as the setting after they had discussed several options.<ref name="CVGRoA"/>

===Artificial intelligence===
The [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) used in the ''Age of Empires'' series has been developed and improved regularly by designers. AI specialist Dave Pottinger noted the development team gave the AI in the original game a very high priority, and spent over a year working on it. He said the AI in the game relies on tactics and strategies to win, instead of "cheating" by giving bonus resources to itself, or tweaking its units to be stronger than normal.<ref name=Dave/> Pottinger later noted that the ''Age of Empires'' series team took great pride in their AI playing a "fair game".<ref name="Age of Empires III Q&A - Technology Overview"/> 

''Age of Empires'' allows players to choose to play either along specialized, story-backed conditions or as individual battles against the AI (and other players).  Choosing to battle against the AI <U+2014> rather than following the storyline <U+2014> allows the AI to adapt to players' strategies.  The AI eventually overcomes players' strategies and easily destroys their villages after several games.  For instance, in ''[[Age of Empires III]],'' this is referred to as playing a "Skirmish."  However ''[[Age of Empires III]]'' allows players to refine their strategies further against the AI by "Building a Deck," which allows players to replace "Home City" shipments with improved alternatives.

In ''[[Age of Empires II: The Conquerors]]'' the AI was given a high priority, the result being the "smart villager" feature, which was highly popular in subsequent games of the series. After building a structure that stores or produces resources, smart villagers would proceed to collect resources related to the structure, such as crops from farms or [[ore]] from stones.<ref name="Age of Empires II: The Conquerors - First Impression"/>

''[[Age of Mythology: The Titans]]'' lets players use an AI [[debugger]] when creating custom scenarios; players can change the settings of computer players and make them act according to certain patterns.<ref name="Age of Mythology: The Titans -- Volume 1"/>

More basic changes to the AI had previously been available in the series' first two games.<ref name="AI Tools"/>

===Graphics and visuals===
The graphics and visuals of ''Age of Empires'' improved with each successive release.  From the original release to the second, ''[[Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings]],'' noteworthy improvements gained praise from several critics.<ref name="GameSpot citation"/><ref name="Allgame citation"/><ref name="GR citation"/>  With the release of ''[[Age of Mythology]]'' the praise continued,<ref name="GameSpot citation"/><ref name="IGN citation"/><ref name="GR continues"/><ref name="PC Gamer citation"/> and the fourth release, ''[[Age of Empires III]],'' garnered even more.<ref name="IGN review"/><ref name="1Up review"/><ref name="GameSpyreview"/>

[[GameSpot]] praised the improved graphics<ref name="GameSpot citation" /> in the second release, ''[[Age of Empires: The Age of Kings]].''  [[Eurogamer]] welcomed its introduction of female villagers<ref name="Eurogamer citation"/> as compared with the original unisex version.  [[Allgame]] praised the advanced grouping and path-finding systems in the second release.<ref name="Allgame citation" />  Despite the improved graphics, [[Allgame]] complained that units in ''[[Age of Empires: The Age of Kings]]'' were at times difficult to distinguish from one another,<ref name="Allgame citation" /> a point numerous reviewers agreed on.<ref name="GameSpot citation" /><ref name="Age Of Empires II: The Age Of Kings"/>  Nevertheless, [[Game Revolution]] wrote that the second release was "the best looking of the 2D RTS games out there right now."<ref name="GR citation" />

The graphics continued to improve in ''[[Age of Mythology]]'' and was praised by a majority of reviewers.  [[IGN]] ranked the graphics in this third release, "a joy to watch ... awesome."<ref name="IGN citation" />  [[GameSpot]] assented, also rating the graphics a 9 out of 10.<ref name="GameSpot citation" />  [[Game Revolution]] agreed,<ref name="GR continues" /> and [[PC Gamer]] stated the that the graphics in the third release "are packed with detail."<ref name="PC Gamer citation" />

The trend in improved graphics continued well into the next release, ''[[Age of Empires III]],'' much to the delight of reviewers.  [[IGN]] stated, "After seeing the screenshots, our jaws hit the floor at the amount of detail."<ref name="IGN review" />  [[1UP.com]] described ''[[Age of Empires III]]'' as "one of the most beautiful games you will put on your computer for the foreseeable future."<ref name="1Up review" />  [[GameSpy]] agreed, stating, "''Age III''{{'}}s graphics are unmatched in the strategy genre."<ref name="GameSpyreview" />  ''Age of Empires III'' builds on and introduces new features to the prior release, ''[[Age of Mythology]],'' such as the inclusion of the award-winning<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.havok.com/index.php?page=awards |title=Awards |publisher=Havok.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref> [[Havok (software)|Havok]] physics simulation [[middleware]]<ref name="Age of Empires III3"/> [[game engine]] for the Windows version and [[PhysX]] for the Mac OS X.  The innovative result is that pre-created [[animation]]s are avoided; instead events are calculated according to the physics engine.  Consequently views of events like building destruction and tree felling are not pre-recorded.  [[GameSpot]] also admired the graphics in the fourth release but complained about "the awkward unit behavior."<ref name="GameSpot review, page 3"/>  Other graphical features of the game include bloom lighting and support for [[pixel shader|pixel shader 3.0]].<ref name="Technology"/>

GameSpy awarded ''[[Age of Empires III]]'' the "Best Graphics" award at GameSpy's "Game of the Year 2005."<ref name="GameSpy's Game of the Year 2005, Best Graphics"/>

===Music===
[[Stephen Rippy]] has been the series' music director since the first game. He has had occasional help from his brother, David Rippy, as well as Kevin McMullan.<ref name="m4g"/> He created the original music in ''Age of Empires'' with sounds of instruments from the periods in the game.<ref name=AoEH /> These sounds came from actual instruments, and their [[sampler (musical instrument)|digital samples]].<ref name=AoEH /> The tunes were the result of extensive research on the cultures, styles, and instruments used.<ref name="AoEH"/> Rippy said sound development on ''The Age of Kings'' was easy, since there was knowledge of the instruments used in the Middle Ages. Therefore, they were able to reproduce the tunes for the soundtrack of the game.<ref name="Soundtracks on CD-ROM: Stirring Music That Accompanies the Interactive"/> In ''Age of Mythology'', an orchestral instrumentation was used, instead. According to McMullan, the team also collected large numbers of audio recordings from [[zoo]]s, and created "a massive sound library of [their] own material."<ref name="Age of Music"/> The music of ''Age of Empires III'' was similar to ''The Age of Kings'', in which the team used more historical instruments; Rippy noted the team used instruments such as "[[bagpipes]] and field [[drum]]s" to give it a realistic feel.<ref name=m4g />

===Collaboration===
Ensemble Studios worked together with [[Big Huge Games]] to develop ''The Asian Dynasties'', ''Age of Empires III''{{'}}s second expansion. This was the first joint venture for both teams. The reason for them doing so was compatible schedules: Ensemble Studios was busy with other projects<U+2014>particularly ''[[Halo Wars]]''<U+2014>while Big Huge Games' real-time strategy team had few projects at that time. Big Huge Games did most of the work, but Ensemble Studios designers Greg Street and [[Sandy Petersen]] joined in the [[brainstorming]], and had control over the final product.<ref name="Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties (PC)"/> Both studios had roles in testing the game before its release.<ref name="Brian Reynolds Interview - Part 1 - July 2007"/>

The ''Age of Empires'' series has been a commercial success. As of 2008, five of its games have each sold more than one million copies. According to [[Gamasutra]], ''Age of Empires'' had sold more than three million copies, and ''The Rise of Rome'' sold one million copies as of 2000.<ref name=AoESales /> Around the same time, Microsoft announced that they shipped over two million copies of ''The Age of Kings''.<ref name=AoKSales /> In 2003, Microsoft announced the sales of one million copies for ''Age of Mythology''.<ref name=AoMSales /> By 2004<U+2014>prior to the release of ''Age of Empires III''<U+2014>the ''Age of Empires'' franchise had sold over 15&nbsp;million copies.<ref name="Best-Selling Age Franchise Tops 15 Million Mark"/> On May 18, 2007, Ensemble Studios announced that two million copies of ''Age of Empires III'' had been sold.<ref name=AoE3sales />
Games in the series have consistently scored highly on video game review [[Review aggregator|aggregator]] websites [[Game Rankings]] and [[Metacritic]], which collect data from numerous review websites. As noted in the table to the right, the highest rating game is ''Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings'', receiving a 92% score from both sites.<ref name=AoKGR /><ref name=AoKMC />

Critics have credited ''Age of Empires'' for influencing real-time strategy (RTS) games such as ''[[Rise of Nations]]'', ''[[Empire Earth]]'',  and ''[[Cossacks: European Wars|Cossacks]]''.<ref name="Rise of Nations for PC review"/><ref name="Cossacks: The Art of War (PC)"/> ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]]'' was also influenced by the series: it utilized the [[genie (game engine)|Genie]] [[game engine]], as ''Age of Empires'' and ''Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings'' had, and was considered by critics to be a very close replica to the games; [[IGN]] began their review with the statement "I love ''Age of Star Wars'', I mean ''Star Empires''. Whatever it's called, I dig it."<ref name="Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds Review"/> and [[GameSpot]] wrote that "fundamentals of the ''Age of Empires II'' engine are so intact in ''Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds'' that veterans of that game can jump right in."<ref name="Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds for PC Review"/> In October 2005, Shelley commented on the impact of the series. In a [[GameSpy]] interview, he explained that parents would "tell [[Ensemble Studios]] that their kid is reading books about ancient Greece because they enjoy playing with the [[trireme]]s so much, or that they want to check out books about medieval history because [the] game taught them what a [[trebuchet]] was."<ref name="AltHist"/>

Shelley has said the key to the success of the games was its innovation, rather than imitation of its peers. He also claimed the unique elements in the games "helped establish the reputation of Ensemble Studios as masters of the real-time strategy genre."<ref name="Guidelines for Developing Successful Games"/> Mark Bozon of IGN wrote in his review of ''The Age of Kings'', "The ''Age of Empires'' series has been one of the most innovative real-time strategy games for PC in the last decade or so."<ref name="The Age of Kings is truly upon us..."/> Gamenikki called Ensemble Studios "the developer that started it all" when they talked about how much ''Age of Empires III'' had done to advance the real-time strategy genre.<ref name="Age of Empires III5"/> Shelley has acknowledged the success and innovation of ''Age of Empires'' helped to ensure Ensemble survive its early periods since startup.<ref name="From Borg to Boss"/> In 2005, Shelley complained of critics holding an "innovation bias" against the series; citing the 60% score from ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', he said that despite ''Age of Empires III'' being "perhaps the best selling PC game in the world," reviewers expected "something really new," and rated it harshly.<ref name="Shelley decries 'innovation bias'"/>

[[Bungie Studios]] chose Ensemble Studios to develop ''[[Halo Wars]]'', an RTS game based on their [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' series]]. They said one of the reasons they chose to work with Ensemble was because of the "awesometastic" ''Age of Empires'' series.<ref name="bungie"/> They also noted that Ensemble was the perfect choice "to realize the original vision of ''Halo''," which started life as an RTS.<ref name="bungie" />
