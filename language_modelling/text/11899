'''''The She Creature''''' (also known as '''''The She-Creature''''') is a 1956 American [[black-and-white]] [[Horror film|horror]] [[film]] produced by [[American International Pictures]] from a script by [[Lou Rusoff]] (brother-in-law of AIP executive [[Samuel Z. Arkoff]]), produced by [[Alex Gordon (writer-producer)|Alex Gordon]] and directed by [[Edward L. Cahn]]. 

== Plot ==
The plot concerns an oily carnival hypnotist ([[Chester Morris]]), whose experiments in hypnotic regression take his unwitting female subject ([[Marla English]]) to a past life as a prehistoric humanoid form of sea-life. He uses the physical manifestation of the prehistoric creature to commit murders. The [[hypnotist]]'s motives are never explicitly described, and the murders happen, apparently, either for revenge or notoriety.

== Production ==
AIP raised finance on the title before a script had been written. The eventual story was inspired by the success of the best-selling book ''[[The Search for Bridey Murphy]]'', which concerned hypnotism. Edward Cahn persuaded his old friend [[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]] to play the hypnotist<ref>Drama: Actor Arnold Signs for 'She Creature'
Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 25 Apr 1956: 34.</ref> for $3,000 for one week's work, and also cast [[Peter Lorre]] to act opposite. Arnold died two days before production, prompting Lorre to read the script, after which he pulled out of the film. The producer had to find a substitute cast quickly.<ref name="AIP">Mark McGee, ''Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures'', McFarland, 1996 p54-56</ref>
