[[Image:Welcome to Wales.jpg|thumb|300px|Sign at [[Llanymynech]], on the border between [[Montgomeryshire]]/[[Powys]], [[Wales]] and [[Shropshire]], [[England]]]]
The '''[[Wales]]&ndash;[[England]] [[border]]''', between two of the [[countries of the United Kingdom]], extends for about {{convert|160|mi|km|0}} from the [[Dee estuary]], in the north, to the [[Severn estuary]] in the south.

It has followed very broadly the same line since the 8th century, and in part generally follows the line of [[Offa's Dyke]], a linear [[Earthworks (Archaeology)|earthwork]].  However, the modern boundary was essentially fixed in 1535, when the former [[Marcher lord|marcher lordships]] which occupied the border area were abolished and new [[Counties of the United Kingdom|county]] boundaries were created.  The administrative boundary of Wales was confirmed in the [[Local Government Act 1972]], which was implemented in 1974. Whether Monmouthshire, created in 1535, was part of Wales, or an English county treated for most purposes as though it were Welsh, was also settled in 1974.  

==Geography==
[[Image:River Dee between Holt and Farndon.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] marking the Wales-England boundary between [[Holt, Wales|Holt]] and [[Farndon, Cheshire|Farndon]]]][[Image:Welcome to England bilingual.jpg|thumb|250px|Bilingual "Welcome to England" sign]]
The modern boundary between Wales and England runs from the [[salt marsh]]es of the Dee estuary adjoining the [[Wirral Peninsula]], across reclaimed land to the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] at [[Saltney]] just west of [[Chester]].  It then loops south to include within England an area south-west of Chester, before rejoining the Dee, and then loops east of the river to include within Wales a large area known as [[Maelor]], formerly an [[exclave]] of [[Flintshire]], between [[Bangor-on-Dee]] (in Wales) and [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]] (in England).  Returning to the River Dee as far as [[Chirk]], the boundary then loops to the west, following Offa's Dyke itself for about 2 miles, and including within England the town of [[Oswestry]], before reaching the [[River Vyrnwy]] at [[Llanymynech]].  It follows the Vyrnwy to its confluence with the [[River Severn]], and then continues southwards, rising over [[Long Mountain (Powys)|Long Mountain]] east of [[Welshpool]]. East of [[Montgomery, Powys|Montgomery]], the boundary again follows the line of Offa's Dyke for about 2 miles, before looping eastwards to include within Wales a large area near [[Churchstoke]].  It then runs westwards to the [[River Teme]], and follows the river south-eastwards through [[Knighton, Powys|Knighton]] before turning south towards the [[River Lugg]] at [[Presteigne]], which is within Wales.

The boundary continues southwards across hills to the [[River Wye]], and follows the river upstream for a short distance to [[Hay-on-Wye]], on the Welsh side of the border.  It continues southwards and rises through and across the [[Black Mountains, Wales|Black Mountains]], following the [[Hatterall Ridge]] past [[Llanthony]] on the Welsh side and [[Longtown, Herefordshire|Longtown]] on the English side, to reach the [[River Monnow]] near [[Pandy, Monmouthshire|Pandy]]. It then generally follows the river, past [[Pontrilas]] (in England) and [[Skenfrith]] (in Wales), towards [[Monmouth]], looping eastwards to include the town itself and a surrounding area within Wales.  At [[Redbrook]], the boundary again reaches the Wye, and follows the river southwards, past [[Tintern]] and [[Chepstow]] on the Welsh side, to its confluence with the Severn at the [[Severn Bridge]].  The boundary then continues down the [[Severn estuary]] towards the [[Bristol Channel]], with the small island of [[Flat Holm]] being administered within Wales and the neighbouring island of [[Steep Holm]] within England.

===Administrative boundary===
The boundary passes between the current local authority [[principal areas]] of [[Flintshire]], [[Wrexham (county borough)|Wrexham]], [[Powys]] and [[Monmouthshire]], in Wales; and [[Cheshire West and Chester]], [[Shropshire Council|Shropshire]], [[Herefordshire]] and [[Forest of Dean (district)|Forest of Dean]] district of [[Gloucestershire]], in England.

In relation to the historic counties, it passes between the historic [[historic counties of Wales|counties]] of [[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]], [[Denbighshire (historic)|Denbighshire]], [[Montgomeryshire]], [[Radnorshire]], [[Brecknockshire]] and [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] on the Welsh side; and [[Cheshire]], [[Shropshire]], [[Herefordshire]] and [[Gloucestershire]] on the [[historic counties of England|English side]].

The border runs down the middle of Boundary Lane in [[Saltney]] dividing administrative/legislative responsibility between houses on one side of the street from the other, the only place on the border where this occurs.<ref name="OneShow6Aug09">''[[The One Show]]'', [[BBC TV]], 6 August 2009</ref>

==History of the border==
[[Image:Wales.post-Roman.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Post-Roman Welsh kingdoms or tribes. The modern border between Wales and England is shown in purple.]]
===Origins===
Before and during the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] occupation of [[Great Britain|Britain]], all the native inhabitants of the island (other than the Pictish and Gaelic tribes of what is now modern day Scotland) spoke [[Brythonic languages]], a sub-family of the [[Celtic languages]], and were regarded as [[Brythons|Britons]].  The clear geographical divide between the mountainous western areas of southern Britain and the generally lower-lying areas to the east was reflected in the pattern of Roman occupation.  The main Roman military bases for the control of what became [[Roman Wales|Wales]] were beyond the mountains, at ''[[Deva Victrix|Deva]]'' ([[Chester]]), ''[[Viroconium]]'' ([[Wroxeter]], near [[Shrewsbury]]), and ''[[Isca Augusta]]'' ([[Caerleon]], near [[Newport]]), all located close to the later national border.  

When the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|Roman garrison left]] around 410, the various parts of Britain were left to govern and defend themselves.  The western area, later [[Wales]], had become largely [[Christianity|Christian]], and soon comprised a number of separate kingdoms, the largest being [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] in the northwest and [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] in the east.  Powys roughly coincided with the territory of the Celtic [[Cornovii]] tribe whose ''civitas'' or administrative centre during the Roman period was at ''Viroconium''.  Gwynedd, at the height of its power, extended as far east as the Dee estuary.  Gradually, from the 5th century onwards, [[Paganism|pagan]] tribes from the east, including the [[Angles]] and [[Saxons]], conquered eastern and southern Britain, which later became England.<ref name=davies>John Davies, ''A History of Wales'', Penguin, 1993, ISBN 0-140-28475-3</ref><ref name=rowley>Trevor Rowley, ''The Welsh Border - archaeology, history and landscape'', Tempus Publishing, 1986, ISBN 0-7524-1917-X</ref>  

In the south, the Welsh [[kingdom of Gwent]] broadly covered the same area as the pre-Roman [[Silures]], traditionally the area between the rivers [[River Usk|Usk]], [[River Wye|Wye]] and the Severn estuary.  It was centred at different times on ''[[Venta Silurum|Venta]]'' ([[Caerwent]]), from which it derived its name, and ''Isca Augusta'' (Caerleon).  Gwent generally allied with, and at various times was joined with, the smaller Welsh kingdom of [[Ergyng]], centred in present-day southern Herefordshire west of the Wye (and deriving its name from the Roman town of ''[[Ariconium]]''); and the larger kingdom of [[Glywysing]] in modern [[Glamorgan]].  The name Glywysing may indicate that it was founded by a British native of ''[[Glevum]]'' ([[Gloucester]]). 
[[Image:Britain peoples circa 600.svg|thumb|250px|left|Peoples of southern Britain, circa 600 AD]]

The [[Battle of Mons Badonicus]], circa 500, could have been fought near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] between the British, the victors, and Anglo-Saxons attempting to reach the Severn estuary, but its date and location are very uncertain and it may equally well have taken place in [[Somerset]] or [[Dorset]].  However, it is more certain that the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of [[Wessex]] emerged in the 6th and 7th centuries in the upper [[Thames]] valley, [[Cotswolds]] and [[Hampshire]] areas.  In 577, the [[Battle of Deorham]] in the southern Cotswolds was won by the Anglo-Saxons, and led to Wessex extending its control to the Severn estuary and the cities of Gloucester, [[Cirencester]], and Bath. This severed the land link between the Britons of Wales and [[Dumnonia|those of the south west peninsula]]. By about 600, however, the area of modern Gloucestershire east of the Severn, as well as most of [[Worcestershire]], was controlled by another group, the [[Hwicce]], who may have arisen from intermarriage between Anglo-Saxon and British leading families, possibly the successors to the pre-Roman [[Dobunni]].  The Hwicce came increasingly under Mercian hegemony. 

At the [[Battle of Chester]] in 616, the forces of Powys and other allied Brythonic kingdoms were defeated by the [[Northumbria|Northumbrians]] under [[<U+00C6>thelfrith of Northumbria|<U+00C6>thelfrith]]. This divided the Britons of Wales from those in the uplands of northern England, including [[Lancashire]], [[Cumbria]], and [[Southern Uplands|south west Scotland]], an area which became known as ''"Yr [[Hen Ogledd]]"'' or "the Old North". Within a few decades, the Welsh became engaged in further defensive warfare against the increasingly powerful kingdom of [[Mercia]], based at [[Tamworth]] in what became the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] of England. The capital of Powys, [[Pengwern]], at or near modern Shrewsbury, was conquered by [[Oswiu of Northumbria]] in 656 when he had become overlord of the Mercians.  Powys then withdrew from the lowland areas now in southern [[Cheshire]], [[Shropshire]] and [[Herefordshire]], which became known to Welsh poets as "The Paradise of Powys".<ref name=davies/>  The areas were occupied by Anglo-Saxon groups who became sub-kingdoms of Mercia, the ''Wreocens<U+01E3>te'' or [[Wrekinset]] in the northern part of what became [[Shropshire]], and the ''[[Magons<U+00E6>te]]'' in the southern part.<ref name=rowley/> Further south, the area north west of the Severn later known as the [[Forest of Dean]] seems to have remained in British (that is, Welsh) hands until about 760.<ref>R. J. Mansfield, ''Forest Story'', 1964</ref>

===Offa's Dyke===
[[Image:Offa's Dyke near Clun.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Offa's Dyke]] near [[Clun]] in Shropshire]]
{{ main|Offa's Dyke}}
After [[Ine of Wessex]] abdicated in 726, [[<U+00C6>thelbald of Mercia]] established Mercia's hegemony over the Anglo-Saxons south of the [[Humber]].  However, campaigns by Powys against Mercia led to the building of [[Wat's Dyke]], an earthwork boundary extending from the [[River Severn|Severn]] valley near Oswestry to the Dee at [[Basingwerk]] in what became [[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]], perhaps to protect recently acquired lands.<ref name=davies/>  After <U+00C6>thelbald was killed in 757, a brief civil war in Mercia then ended in victory for his distant cousin, [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]].  As king, he rebuilt Mercia's hegemony over the southern English through military campaigns, and also caused the construction of Offa's Dyke, around the years 770/780.<ref name=hill>David Hill and Margaret Worthington, ''Offa's Dyke - history and guide'', Tempus Publishing, 2003, ISBN 0-7524-1958-7</ref>

[[Offa's Dyke]] is a massive linear earthwork, up to 65 feet (20&nbsp;m) wide (including its surrounding ditch) and 8 feet (2.5&nbsp;m) high.  It is much larger and longer than Wat's Dyke, but runs roughly parallel to it. The earthwork was generally dug with the displaced soil piled into a bank on the Mercian (eastern) side, providing an open view into Wales and suggesting that it was built by Mercia to guard against attacks or raids from Powys. The late 9th-century writer [[Asser]] wrote that Offa ''"terrified all the neighbouring kings and provinces around him, and ... had a great dyke built between Wales and Mercia from sea to sea"''.  In the mid-20th century, Sir [[Cyril Fox]] completed a major survey of the Dyke and stated that it ran from the Dee to the Severn, as Asser suggested, but with gaps, especially in the Herefordshire area, where natural barriers of strong rivers or dense forests provided sufficient defence.  More recent research by David Hill and Margaret Worthington concluded that there is little evidence for the Dyke stretching "from sea to sea", but that the earthwork built by Offa stretched some 64 miles (103&nbsp;km) between [[Rushock Hill]] near [[Kington, Herefordshire|Kington]] in Herefordshire, and [[Treuddyn]] in Flintshire. Earthworks in the far north and south, including sections overlooking the [[Wye valley]] and east of the Wye at [[Beachley]], may in their view have been built for different purposes at different times, although their conclusions are themselves disputed.<ref name=hill/><ref>[http://www.cpat.org.uk/offa/offrev.htm  Review of Hill and Worthington book by Ian Bapty]</ref>

Offa's Dyke largely remained the frontier between the Welsh and English in later centuries.  By the 9th century, the expanding power of Mercia led to it gaining control over Ergyng and nearby [[Hereford]]. The system of [[shires]] which was later to form the basis of local administration throughout England and eventually Wales originated in Wessex, where it became established during the 8th century.  Wessex and Mercia gradually established an occasionally unstable alliance, with Wessex gaining the upper hand.  According to Asser, the southern Welsh kings, including Hywel ap Rhys of Glywysing, commended themselves to [[Alfred the Great]] of Wessex in about 885. Alfred's son [[Edward the Elder]] also secured homage from the Welsh, although sporadic border unrest continued. In the early 10th century, a document known as ''The Ordinance Concerning the Dunsaete'' records procedures for dealing with disputes between the English and the Welsh, and implies that areas west of the Wye in [[Archenfield]] were still culturally Welsh.  It stated that the English should only cross into the Welsh side, and vice versa, in the presence of an appointed man who had the responsibility of making sure that the foreigner was safely escorted back to the crossing point.<ref>[http://www.smr.herefordshire.gov.uk/saxon_viking/as_hrfds.htm  Anglo-Saxon Herefordshire]</ref>  In 926, Edward's successor [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]], "King of the English", summoned the Welsh kings including [[Hywel Dda]] of [[Deheubarth]] to a meeting at Hereford, and according to [[William of Malmesbury]] laid down the boundary between Wales and England, particularly the disputed southern stretch where he specified that the eastern bank of the Wye should form the boundary.  

By the mid-eleventh century, most of Wales had become united under the king of [[Gwynedd]], [[Gruffudd ap Llywelyn]].  In 1055 he marched on Hereford and sacked the city.  He also seized [[Morgannwg]] and [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]], together with substantial territories east of Offa's Dyke, and raided as far as Chester and [[Leominster]].<ref name=rowley/> He claimed sovereignty over the whole of Wales, a claim recognised by the English, and historian [[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]] states that Gruffudd was ''"the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales."''<ref name=davies/>  However, his murder in 1063 left a power vacuum, and [[Harold Godwinson]], [[Earl of Hereford]], and his brother [[Tostig]], began a campaign of subjugation in Wales which continued until Harold was defeated at the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066.

===The March of Wales===
[[Image:Chepstow Castle and Bridge from Tutshill.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[River Wye]], 1816 road bridge and [[Chepstow Castle|castle]] at [[Chepstow]]. The river forms the boundary between [[Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]] (left) and [[Gloucestershire]], [[England]] (right)]]{{ main|Welsh Marches}}
Immediately after the [[Norman conquest of England]], King [[William I of England|William]] installed one of his most trusted confidants, [[William FitzOsbern]], as Earl of Hereford.  By 1071 he had started the building of [[Chepstow Castle]], the first castle in Britain built of stone, near the mouth of the Wye. It served as a base from which the Normans continued to expand westward into [[south Wales]], establishing a castle at Caerleon and extinguishing the Welsh kingdom of Gwent. William also installed [[Roger de Montgomerie]] at Shrewsbury, and [[Hugh d'Avranches]] at Chester, creating a new expansionist [[Marcher lord|earldom]] in each case.<ref>[http://www.castlewales.com/norman.html  Norman Castles]</ref> In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, Norman lands are recorded west of the Wye at Chepstow and [[Caldicot, Monmouthshire|Caldicot]] in the [[Gwent Levels]] ({{lang-cy|Gwent Is-coed}}); over the whole of north east Wales as far west as the [[River Clwyd]], an area known to the Welsh as the ''[[Perfeddwlad]]''; and west of Offa's Dyke, especially in Powys where a new castle was named, after its lord, Montgomery.<ref name=davies/> 

[[Domesday Book]] no doubt records the extent of English penetration into Wales.  This suggests that Offa's Dyke still approximately represented the boundary between England and Wales.  However, during the [[The Anarchy|anarchy of Stephen]] various Welsh princes were able to occupy lands beyond it, including [[Whittington, Shropshire]] (see [[Whittington Castle]]) and [[Maelor|Maelor Saesnaeg]], hitherto in England.  These lands were brought under English lordship by [[Henry II of England]], but became [[Marcher lord]]ships, and so part of Wales.  This involved a loss of direct rule by the English crown.<ref>P. Brown, P King and P. Remfry, 'Whittington Castle: the marcher fortress of the Fitz Warin family' ''Shropshire Archaeology and History'' LXXIX (2004), 106-8.  </ref>  

Over the next four centuries, Norman lords established mostly small lordships, at times numbering over 150, between the Dee and Severn and further west. The precise dates and means of formation of the lordships varied, as did their size. Hundreds of small castles, mostly of the [[motte and bailey]] type, were built in the border area in the 12th and 13th centuries, predominantly by Norman lords as assertions of power as well as defences against Welsh raiders and rebels. Many new towns were established across the area, some such as Chepstow, [[Monmouth]], [[Ludlow]] and [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]] becoming successful trading centres, and these tended to be a focus of English settlement. However, the Welsh continued to attack English soil and supported rebellions against the Normans.<ref name=davies/><ref name=rowley/>

The [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], or ''Marchia Wallia'', were to a greater or lesser extent independent of both the English monarchy and the [[Principality of Wales]], which remained based in Gwynedd in the north west of the country.  By the early 12th century, they covered the areas which would later become [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] and much of [[Flintshire]], [[Montgomeryshire]], [[Radnorshire]], [[Brecknockshire]], [[Glamorgan]], [[Carmarthenshire]] and [[Pembrokeshire]].  Some of the lordships, such as Oswestry, [[Whittington Castle|Whittington]], [[Clun]], and [[Wigmore, Herefordshire|Wigmore]] had been part of England at the time of Domesday, while others such as [[Powys Wenwynwyn|the Lordship of Powys]] were Welsh principalities that passed by marriage into the hands of Norman barons.  In ecclesiastical terms, the ancient [[diocese]]s of [[Bishop of Bangor|Bangor]] and [[Diocese of St Asaph|St. Asaph]] in the north, and [[Diocese of St David's|St. David's]] and [[Diocese of Llandaff|Llandaff]] in the south, collectively defined an area which included both the Principality and the March, and coincided closely with later definitions of Wales.<ref name=davies/>

The [[Principality of Wales]] ({{lang-cy|Tywysogaeth Cymru}}) covered the lands ruled by the [[Prince of Wales]] directly, and was formally founded in 1216, and later recognised by the 1218 Treaty of Worcester between [[Llywelyn ab Iorwerth]], [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Prince of Gwynedd]], and King [[John of England]]. Encompassing two-thirds of modern Wales, the principality operated as an effectively independent entity from the reign of Llywelyn until 1283 (though it underwent a period of contraction during the early part of the reign of [[Dafydd ap Llywelyn]] in the 1240s, and again for several years from the beginning of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]]'s rule in 1246). Its independence was characterized by a separate legal jurisprudence based on the well established laws of ''[[Welsh Law|Cyfraith Hywel]]'', and by the increasingly sophisticated [[Curia Regis|court]] of the [[Aberffraw]] dynasty.<ref name=davies/> 

The [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in 1284 followed the conquest of the Principality by [[Edward I of England]].  It assumed the lands held by the Princes of Gwynedd under the title "[[Prince of Wales]]" as legally part of the lands of England, and established shire counties on the English model over those areas. The [[Council of Wales and the Marches|Council of Wales]], based at [[Ludlow Castle]], was also established in the 15th century to govern the area.

===The formation of "England and Wales" and the county boundaries===
{{main|Laws in Wales Acts 1535<U+2013>1542}}
However, the Marches remained outside the shire system, and at least nominally outside the control of the English monarchy, until the first [[Laws in Wales Act]] was introduced in 1535 under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. This, and a further Act in 1542, had the effect of annexing Wales to [[Kingdom of England|England]] and creating a single state and legal [[jurisdiction]], commonly referred to as [[England and Wales]]. The powers of the marcher lordships were abolished, and their areas formed into new counties, or amalgamated into existing ones.  

At this point, the boundary between England and Wales, which has existed ever since, was effectively fixed.  In the border areas, five new counties were created - Denbighshire, Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire, Brecknockshire and Monmouthshire - and Flintshire gained some additional territory.  However, several of the marcher lordships were incorporated in whole or in part into English counties.  The lordships of Ludlow, Clun, [[Caus Castle|Caus]] and part of Montgomery were incorporated into Shropshire; and [[Wigmore, Herefordshire|Wigmore]], [[Huntington, Herefordshire|Huntington]], [[Clifford, Herefordshire|Clifford]] and most of [[Ewyas]] were included in Herefordshire.  According to John Davies:<ref name=davies/>

<blockquote>Thus was created the border between Wales and England, a border which has survived until today. It did not follow the old line of Offa's Dyke nor the eastern boundary of the Welsh dioceses; it excluded districts such as Oswestry and Ewias, where the Welsh language would continue to be spoken for centuries, districts which it would not be wholly fanciful to consider as ''Cambria irredenta''. Yet, as the purpose of the statute was to incorporate Wales into England, the location of the Welsh border was irrelevant to the purposes of its framers.</blockquote>

An 1844 Act of Parliament later abolished several [[enclave]]s. One of these, [[Welsh Bicknor]], was an exclave of Monmouthshire between Gloucestershire and Herefordshire.

===Monmouthshire===
{{ main|Monmouthshire (historic)}}
Although Monmouthshire was included in the 16th century legislation, it was treated anomalously, with the result that its legal status as a Welsh county fell into some ambiguity and doubt until the 20th century.<ref name=bbc>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/history/pages/counties_monmouth.shtml  BBC Wales: Monmouthshire]</ref> It was omitted from the second Act of Union, which established the [[Court of Great Sessions in Wales|Court of Great Sessions]], and like English shires it was given two [[Knights of the Shire]], rather than one as elsewhere in Wales.  However, in ecclesiastical terms, almost all of the county remained within the [[Diocese of Llandaff]], and most of its residents at the time spoke [[Welsh language|Welsh]].  In the late 17th century under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] it was added to the Oxford circuit of the [[Assize Court#England and Wales|English Assizes]], following which, according to the [[1911 Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]], it gradually ''"came to be regarded as an English county"''.<ref name=eb1911>[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Monmouthshire  Monmouthshire in 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica]</ref> Under that interpretation, the boundary between England and Wales passed down the [[Rhymney River|Rhymney valley]], along Monmouthshire's western borders with Brecknockshire and Glamorgan, so including [[Newport]], and other industrialised parts of what would now generally be considered to be [[South Wales]], within England.

The 1911 Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica unambiguously described the county as part of England, but noted that ''"whenever an act [...] is intended to apply to [Wales] alone, then Wales is always coupled with Monmouthshire"''.  Some legislation and UK government decisions, such as the establishment of a "Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire" in 1908,<ref>[http://www.ndad.nationalarchives.gov.uk/AH/6/detail.html National Archives: Welsh Office]</ref> referred to "Wales and Monmouthshire", so that it was treated ''as one'' with Wales rather than as a legal ''part of'' Wales.  The county's status continued to be a matter of debate in Parliament, especially as Welsh nationalism and devolution climbed the political agenda in the 20th century.  In 1921 the area was included within the [[Church in Wales]].  The [[Welsh Office]], established in 1966, included Monmouthshire within its remit, and in 1969 [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas]], [[Secretary of State for Wales]], proposed to fully incorporate Monmouthshire into Wales. The issue was finally clarified in law by the [[Local Government Act 1972]],<ref name=bbc/> which provided that ''"in every act passed on or after 1 April  1974, and in every instrument made on or after that date under any enactment (whether before, on or after that date) "Wales", subject to any alterations of boundaries..."'' included ''"the administrative county of Monmouthshire and the county borough of Newport"''.<ref>Local Government Act 1972 (c.70), sections 1, 20 and 269</ref>  The national boundary between Wales and England therefore now passes unequivocally along Monmouthshire's eastern boundaries with the English counties of [[Herefordshire]] and [[Gloucestershire]], essentially along the [[River Monnow]] and [[River Wye]].

==The border today==
[[File:Siaradwyr y Gymraeg ym Mhrif Ardaloedd Cymru.png|thumb|200px|Map showing the proportion of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] speakers in the local authorities of Wales, showing the relatively lower proportions in areas close to the border with the longest history of English settlement and influence.]]

Since the first [[Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881|legislation applying solely to Wales]] since the 16th century was passed in 1881, the border between Wales and England has taken on increasing legal and political significance. In 1964 a separate [[department of state]] was established for Wales - the [[Welsh Office]] - which assumed an increasing range of administrative responsibilities from [[Whitehall]].<ref name="encyclopedia">The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008</ref> By 1992, the Welsh Office oversaw [[public housing|housing]], [[Local government in Wales|local government]], roads, historic buildings, [[Healthcare in the United Kingdom|health]], education, [[economic development]], [[agricultural policy|agriculture]], [[fisheries]] and [[urban regeneration]],<ref name="encyclopedia"/> although the extent to which it was able to be autonomous from England in [[public policy]] is a matter of debate.<ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119068994/abstract Griffiths, D. (2002) The Welsh Office and Welsh Autonomy in Public Administration, Volume 77 Issue 4]</ref>

The establishment of [[devolution|devolved government]] in Wales through the [[Welsh Assembly]], set up in 1999, has led to a divergence between England and Wales on some Government policies.  One such is the fact that [[prescription charges]] were abolished in Wales in 2007.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6513579.stm BBC: Prescription charges end in Wales]</ref>  In 2008, residents of the village of [[Audlem]], Cheshire, 9 miles from the border, "voted" to become part of Wales in what was originally a joke ballot. Some residents sought to make a case for securing Welsh benefits such as free hospital parking and prescriptions.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7364464.stm  BBC: English village votes to be Welsh]</ref>  The modern border has a number of anomalies - for instance, it separates [[Knighton, Powys|Knighton]], [[Powys]], from its railway station, and divides the village of [[Llanymynech]] where a [[pub]] straddles the line. Knighton is the only town that can claim to be on the border as well as on [[Offa's Dyke]]. The postal and ecclesiastical borders are slightly different - for example the Shropshire village of [[Chirbury]] has [[Montgomery, Powys]], as its postal address, but [[Presteigne]], Powys, is in the English [[Diocese of Hereford]].

Many road signs in Wales are bilingual.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/livinginwales/sites/howdoisay/roadsigns/ BBC: Bilingual road signs]</ref> There are also [[Education in Wales|differences between the Welsh and English education systems]].  In Wales, lessons in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] are compulsory for all until the age of 16. The system of statutory national key-stage tests in Wales is also different from that in England. Charges for university tuition are different for Welsh resident students studying at Welsh universities, compared with students from or studying elsewhere in the UK.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4119268.stm Q&A: Welsh top-up fees]: BBC News, 22 June 2005.

On both of these routes there is a significant [[Toll road|toll]] to be paid when travelling from England into Wales.  The continuing existence and size of these tolls, which are set by legislation and revised annually, is a contentious issue, with some businesses and politicians in south Wales arguing that they stunt the growth of Wales' economy.<ref>[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/south-wales-news/neath/2008/11/06/councillor-s-campaign-to-end-severn-bridge-toll-91466-22179892/ Councillor<U+2019>s campaign to end Severn Bridge toll]</ref><ref>[http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Drivers-fear-hammer-blow-rise-toll-fees-Severn-bridges/article-399550-detail/article.html Drivers fear 'hammer blow' rise in toll fees at Severn bridges]</ref>

A competition was launched in 2005 to design one or more new iconic images, along the same lines as the "[[Angel of the North]]", to be placed at the borders of Wales.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/4512153.stm  BBC: Gateway sculpture plan for Wales]</ref>  This became known as the "Landmark Wales" project, and a shortlist of 15 proposals was unveiled in 2007.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/6343161.stm  BBC: Gateway sculptures artists chosen]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/6553145.stm  BBC: Iconic Welsh gateways]</ref>  However, the proposal was shelved after it failed to receive [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|Lottery]] funding.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/7058142.stm  BBC: Giant postcard misses shortlist]</ref>

==Place names==
In general, [[Welsh placenames|placenames of Welsh origin]] are found to the west of the border, and those of English origin to the east.  However, many historically Welsh names are also found east of the border, particularly around Oswestry in northern Shropshire, such as [[Gobowen]]; in southern Shropshire, such as [[Clun]]; and in southern Herefordshire, such as [[Kilpeck]] and [[Pontrilas]].  Most of these areas were not incorporated fully into England until the 16th century, and native Welsh speakers still lived there until at least the 19th century.  Equally, placenames of English origin can be found on the Welsh side of the border where there was Mercian and Norman settlement, particularly in the north east, such as [[Flint, Flintshire|Flint]] and [[Prestatyn]]; in central Powys, such as [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]] and [[Knighton, Powys|Knighton]]; in south [[Pembrokeshire]]<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/themes/pages/english.shtml BBC - Wales - What's in a name - English influences]</ref> and [[Gower Peninsula|Gower]];<ref>[http://www.ggat.org.uk/cadw/historic_landscape/gower/english/Gower_Features.htm Gower Historical Processes, Themes and Background]</ref> and in eastern Monmouthshire, including Chepstow and [[Shirenewton]].  Although Welsh names exist for these places, they generally came into use after the English names.
