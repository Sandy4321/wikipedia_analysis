In February 2007, the band released ''[[Infinity on High]]'' to major chart success, reaching #1 on the [[Billboard 200]] and selling 260,000 copies its first week.

==History==
===2001&ndash;2002: Early years===
Fall Out Boy was formed in early 2001 by friends Joe Trohman and Pete Wentz. The two had played in various [[hardcore punk]] bands in the Chicago area. They decided they wanted to start a band that was more similar to bands they listened to growing up such as [[Green Day]], [[Descendents (band)|Descendents]], and [[The Smiths]].<ref name=Sugarush>{{cite web |last=Gitlin |first=Lauren |title=Fall Out Boy's Sugar Rush |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=[[August 12]] [[2005]] |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7546662/fall_out_boys_sugar_rush |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref> Trohman met high schooler Patrick Stump in a Borders Bookstore.<ref>{{cite web |title=Joe Trohman |work=[[TV.com]] |date=[[September 19]] [[2006]] |url=http://www.tv.com/joe-trohman/person/412087/biography.html |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref> Trohman introduced himself to Stump when he overheard him talking about the band [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]], in which they shared a mutual interest.<ref name=PSJournal>{{cite web |last=Stump |first=Patrick |title=Patrick Stump's Journal |work=GreatestCities.com (Cached version) |url=http://64.233.169.104/search?q=cache:MdcS9zYvylIJ:www.greatestcities.com/users/xpatrickx/ |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref> Stump auditioned as a drummer, but as soon as his vocal range was discovered, he became the lead singer.<ref>{{cite video | people = Fall Out Boy (2004) | title = My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue | medium = DVD | publisher = Fueled By Ramen | date = 2004 }}</ref>
Two other Chicago musicians were recruited to play drums and guitar. The following year, the band debuted with a self-released demo and followed it up with the [[May 28]], [[2002 in music|2002]] release of ''[[Fall Out Boy/Project Rocket Split EP|Split EP]]'', which featured [[Project Rocket]], on [[Uprising Records]]. The group released a mini-LP, ''[[Fall Out Boy's Evening Out with Your Girlfriend]]'', on Uprising Records, in 2003.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web | last=Loftus | first=Johnny | title=Biography: Fall Out Boy | work= All Music Guide| url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kzfexqw0ldte~T1 | date=2007 | accessdate=May 11 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

The band was nameless for their first two shows. At the end of their second show, they asked the audience to yell out their ideas for a name. One audience member suggested "[[List of fictional characters within The Simpsons#Fallout Boy|Fallout Boy]]",<ref name=PSJournal /><ref>{{cite web |last=Lamb |first=Bill |title=Fall Out Boy |work=[[About.com]] |date=2007 |url=http://top40.about.com/od/artistsdk/p/falloutboy.htm |accessdate=July 3 |accessyear=2004}}</ref> a reference to the sidekick of the [[Simpsons]] cartoon character [[Radioactive Man (The Simpsons character)|Radioactive Man]].<ref name=Sugarush /><ref>{{cite web |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |title=Fall Out Boy: Warped, Wicked & Wonderful |work=[[VH1.com]] |date=July 25, 2005 |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1506189/20050722/fall_out_boy.jhtml |accessdate=June 16 |accessyear=2007}}</ref>

===2003&ndash;2004: Independent success===

After the release of their mini-album, [[Andy Hurley]], formerly of [[Racetraitor]], joined the band<ref>{{cite web |title=Fall Out Boy Information |work=VividSeats.com |date=2007 |url=http://www.vividseats.com/concerts/fall-out-boy-tickets.html |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref> and Stump picked up guitar, while the other two Chicago musicians left. During this time, they played many local shows at the The Knights of Columbus Hall in [[Arlington Heights, Illinois]], the site of their first video: "Dead on Arrival".  The same year, after signing to [[Fueled by Ramen]], they released their first full-length album, ''[[Take This to Your Grave]]'', on [[May 6]], [[2003 in music|2003]]. The band received an advance from [[Island Records]] to record their proper debut, but the advance came with a [[right of first refusal]] for Island on Fall Out Boy's next album.<ref name=MTVMain>{{Cite web |title=Fall Out Boy: Main |work=[[MTV.com]] |date=2007 |url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/fall_out_boy/artist.jhtml |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref> With major financing in place, the recording of ''Take This to Your Grave'' took place at the [[Butch Vig]] owned [[Smart Studios]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], with [[Sean O'Keefe (producer)|Sean O'Keefe]] producing.<ref name=MTVMain />

With singles "[[Grand Theft Autumn / Where Is Your Boy]]" and "[[Saturday (song)|Saturday]]" receiving video airplay on [[Fuse TV|FUSE]] and [[mtvU]] and radio airplay on alternative stations across the country, the band soon gained a cult following.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fall Out Boy: Artist Info |work=CDFuse.com |url=http://www.cdfuse.com/falloutboy |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref> With positive reviews at the [[South by Southwest]] Music Festival<ref>{{cite web|author=Loftus, Johnny & Apar, Corey |title=Fall Out Boy Biography |work=[[All Music Guide]] |date=2007 |url=http://www.allmusicguide.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:kzfexqw0ldte~T1 |accessdate= June 16 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> and an extensive tour schedule, Fall Out Boy's popularity continued to grow. The album sold very well and eventually achieved [[RIAA certification|Gold]] status, but only after the success of their next album, ''From Under the Cork Tree''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Davies |first=Tom |title=Fall Out Boy |work=gigwise.com |url=http://www.gigwise.com/profile.asp?contentid=15825 |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref>

In mid-2003, the band signed with [[Island Records]] which is a part of the super label [[The Island Def Jam Music Group]], along with [[Def Jam Records]]. This was after they picked up the option for their next album. In the meantime of recording their mainstream debut, they released the acoustic [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue]]'' on Fueled by Ramen, [[May 18]], [[2004 in music|2004]]. It debuted at #153 on the Billboard Top 200, their first such entry on the chart.<ref>{{cite web |title=My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue (EP) |work=[[Billboard.com]] |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/discography/index.jsp?pid=489932&aid=630998#review |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref> The two-disc set included a DVD with videos, more acoustic performances and a fan photo gallery.<ref name="AMG"/>

==Musical style==
While widely considered to be an [[alternative rock]] [[rock band|band]], Fall Out Boy is often described as [[pop punk]] and [[Emo (music)|emo]]. ''[[Take This To Your Grave]]'' and ''[[From Under The Cork Tree]]'' are both said to have pop punk as well as hardcore punk sounds and influences, and their latest work, ''[[Infinity On High]]'', features a wide range of styles and instrumentation, including an orchestra and choir ("[[Thnks fr th Mmrs]]", "[[You're Crashing, But You're No Wave]]") and a slower piano ballad ("Golden").<ref>{{citeweb |last=Loftus |first=Johnny |title=Take This To Your Grave |work=[[All Music Guide]] |url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:dzfyxq8ald6e |accessdate=July 20 |accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref name=Cork>{{cite web |last=Loftus |first=Johnny |title=From Under The Cork Tree |work=[[All Music Guide]] |url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:0xfexq9sldje |accessdate=July 20 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> Moreover, a central part of Fall Out Boy's sound is rooted in the band's lyrics, mainly penned by bassist Pete Wentz. He commonly uses irony along with other literal devices to detail personal experiences and stories.<ref name=Cork />
