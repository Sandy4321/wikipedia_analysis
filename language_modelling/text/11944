'''Kosta Milovanovi<U+0107> Pe<U+0107>anac''' ({{lang-sr-cyrl|<U+041A><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+0430> <U+041F><U+0435><U+045B><U+0430><U+043D><U+0430><U+0446>}}; 1879<U+2013>1944) was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[Chetnik#World_War_I_and_the_Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia|Chetnik]] commander (''[[vojvoda]]'') during the [[Balkan Wars]], [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Pe<U+0107>anac fought on the [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbian]] side in both Balkan Wars and World War I, joining the forces of [[Kosta Vojinovi<U+0107> (soldier)|Kosta Vojinovi<U+0107>]] during the [[Toplica uprising]] of 1917. Between the wars he was an important leader of Chetnik veteran associations, and was known for his strong hostility to the [[Yugoslav Communist Party]], which made him popular with conservatives such as the [[Yugoslav Radical Union]]. As president of the Chetnik Association from 1932, he transformed the association into an aggressively partisan Serb political organisation with over half a million members. During World War II, Pe<U+0107>anac [[collaborationism|collaborated]] with both the German military administration and their [[Government of National Salvation|Serbian puppet government]] in the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia]].{{sfnm|Hehn|1971|1p=350|Pavlowitch|2002|2p=141|ps=, official name of the occupied territory.}}

Just before the [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, Pe<U+0107>anac was provided with funds and arms to raise guerrilla units in the southern parts of Serbia, [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and the [[Kosovo|Kosovo region]], and he succeeded in forming a detachment of about 300 men largely in the [[Toplica (river)|Toplica river]] valley in southern Serbia, which avoided destruction during the invasion. In the first three months after the surrender, Pe<U+0107>anac gathered more troops from Serb refugees fleeing Macedonia and Kosovo. However, his Chetniks fought only Albanian groups in the region, and did not engage the Germans. Following the uprising in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia in early July 1941, Pe<U+0107>anac quickly resolved to abandon resistance against the Axis, and by the end of August had concluded agreements with the German occupation forces and the puppet government of [[Milan Nedi<U+0107>]] to collaborate with them and fight the communist [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]].

The Germans rapidly realised that Pe<U+0107>anac's Chetniks, whose numbers had grown to 8,000, were inefficient and unreliable, and even the Nedi<U+0107> government had no confidence in them. They were completely disbanded by March 1943. Pe<U+0107>anac himself was interned by the Nedi<U+0107> regime for some time, and was assassinated by agents of rival Chetnik leader [[Dra<U+017E>a Mihailovi<U+0107>]] in May or June 1944.

==Early life==
Kosta Milovanovi<U+0107> was born in a village near [[De<U+010D>ani]] in 1879, although some sources mistakenly identify him as being born in 1871. His father Milovan was a guardian of the [[Visoki De<U+010D>ani]] monastery. Pe<U+0107>anac's father and his brother Milosav fought in the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877<U+2013>1878]]. In 1883, both of his parents were killed in an attack by Albanians on the monastery. After that point, Pe<U+0107>anac was looked after by his uncle in the village of <U+0110>urakovac near [[Pe<U+0107>]] for an unknown amount of time.{{sfn|Pavlovi<U+0107>|Mladenovi<U+0107>|29 April 2003}}

He arrived in [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] in 1892 at the age of 14 and worked as a [[mercenary]]. When he was 21, he was called up for army service and served in the engineer corps, becoming a reserve officer. He later worked with the border gendarmerie near [[Vranje]] as a [[corporal]]. Pe<U+0107>anac was discharged at some point for reasons unknown and later joined the Chetniks. While serving with them he was given the nickname "Pe<U+0107>anac", derived from the name of the town in which he grew up.{{sfn|Pavlovi<U+0107>|Mladenovi<U+0107>|30 April 2003}}

==Macedonia and the Balkan Wars==
In 1895, war broke out in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Pe<U+0107>anac took part in the Chetnik action against the [[Ottoman army]] and fought in numerous areas including [[<U+0160>uplja Stena]] (near [[P<U+010D>inja District|P<U+010D>inja]]) and the village of [[<U+010C>elopek, Brvenica|<U+010C>elopek]].{{sfn|Pavlovi<U+0107>|Mladenovi<U+0107>|4 May 2003}} The [[deacon]] of the [[Vladika]] of [[<U+017D>i<U+010D>a]] and commander ({{lang-sh|vojvoda, <U+0432>o<U+0458><U+0432><U+043E><U+0434><U+0430>}}) [[Jovan Grkovi<U+0107>-Gapon]] suggested awarding Pe<U+0107>anac the title of ''vojvoda''. At a Christmas-day meeting in 1904, Pe<U+0107>anac received the title at the age of 25. In the period between 1905 and 1907, he led several major battles against the Ottoman army in the [[Skopje]] region.{{sfn|Pavlovi<U+0107>|Mladenovi<U+0107>|5 May 2003}} In 1908, Pe<U+0107>anac married Sofia Milosavljevi<U+0107> from the town of [[Aleksinac]]. He went on to father four children with her.{{sfn|Pavlovi<U+0107>|Mladenovi<U+0107>|6 May 2003}} In 1910, as the struggles in Macedonia intensified, he left his children and pregnant wife, and returned to the battlefield.{{sfn|Pavlovi<U+0107>|Mladenovi<U+0107>|8 May 2003}}

In the [[First Balkan War]], fought from October 1912 to May 1913, Pe<U+0107>anac was mobilised in the Serbian Third Army, holding the rank of [[sergeant]] in the [[Morava Division]]. He took part in the defeat of the Albanians in [[Merdare]], the [[Battle of Kumanovo]] and the liberation of [[Metohija]].{{sfn|Pavlovi<U+0107>|Mladenovi<U+0107>|8 May 2003}} During the [[Second Balkan War]], fought from 29 June to 10 August 1913, Pe<U+0107>anac is believed to have been stationed at the front at Kitka on [[Osogovo]] Mountain along the [[Zletovska]] and [[Bregalnica]] rivers. There, his division took part in the [[Battle of Bregalnica]] with the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgarians]]. After the Bulgarian attacks failed, they sent parliamentarians to seek a truce, but the Serbian side refused and the fighting continued. After his division had endured six days of heavy fighting, the Bulgarians were defeated at [[Grljani]] near [[Municipality of Vinica|Vinica]].{{sfn|Pavlovi<U+0107>|Mladenovi<U+0107>|11 May 2003}}

==World War I==
Following the disastrous end to the [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|Serbian campaign]] in late 1915, Pe<U+0107>anac escaped to [[Corfu]] along with the retreating Serbian army and government, and ultimately joined the [[Salonika front]]. In 1915, Pe<U+0107>anac had received various medals for his "merit in fighting" including three gold medals for bravery, one for military virtue, and the [[Order of the Star of Kara<U+0111>or<U+0111>e]] (4th Class) for his service in World War I and possibly also for his prior military feats.{{sfn|Pavlovi<U+0107>|Mladenovi<U+0107>|12 May 2003}} In September 1916, the Serbian high command sent then Lieutenant Pe<U+0107>anac by air to [[Mehane]] (south-west of [[Ni<U+0161>]] in the [[Toplica District|Toplica]] region) to prepare a guerrilla uprising in support of a planned Allied offensive. There, Pe<U+0107>anac contacted several groups of guerrillas, known as ''comitadji''. Pe<U+0107>anac joined forces with local leader Kosta Vojinovi<U+0107> and they both established headquarters on [[Kopaonik|Mount Kopaonik]]. Rivalry quickly developed between the two leaders, mainly because Pe<U+0107>anac only had orders to prepare to support the planned Allied offensive, but Vojinovi<U+0107> was conducting operations that might result in pre-emptive action by the Bulgarian occupation forces. Matters came to a head in January&nbsp;<U+2013> February 1917 when the Bulgarians began conscripting local Serbs for military service. At a meeting of guerrilla leaders to discuss whether they should commence a general uprising, Pe<U+0107>anac was outvoted. However, events had overtaken the leaders, and they were essentially joining a popular uprising that was already underway. After guerrillas under Pe<U+0107>anac's command engaged the Bulgarians he was hailed as a leader of the resistance, although he had serious reservations about the eventual outcome once the Bulgarians and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarians]] committed large numbers of troops to subdue the uprising. The guerrillas were closing on Ni<U+0161> in early March when the occupying forces went on the offensive. Pe<U+0107>anac advised his fighters to hide out in the woods and mountains, while Vojinovi<U+0107> ordered his to fight to the death. By 25 March, the uprising had been crushed.{{sfn|Mitrovi<U+0107>|2007|pp=248<U+2013>259}}

In April 1917, Pe<U+0107>anac re-emerged with his guerrillas, attacking a railway station, destroying a bridge and raiding a Bulgarian village on the border. Pe<U+0107>anac avoided a further offensive by the occupation forces in July by disappearing into the mountains once again. After emerging for a short time, in September&nbsp;<U+2013> October 1917 Pe<U+0107>anac again dispersed his guerrillas and infiltrated the [[Imperial and Royal Military Administration in Serbia|Austro-Hungarian occupied zone]] where he remained in hiding until mid-1918.{{sfn|Mitrovi<U+0107>|2007|pp=261<U+2013>273}}

Between the two World Wars he was the most prominent figure in the Chetnik movement, and also had a leading role in the [[Association against Bulgarian Bandits]], a notorious organisation that arbitrarily terrorised Bulgarians in the [[<U+0160>tip]] region.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=47}} In 1932, he became the president of the Chetnik Association.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=126}} By opening membership of the Chetnik Association to new younger members that had not served in World War I, he grew the organisation during the 1930s from a nationalist veterans' association focused on protecting veterans' rights to an aggressively partisan Serb political organisation with 500,000 members throughout the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Singleton|1985|p=188}} During this period, Pe<U+0107>anac formed close ties with the far-right [[Yugoslav Radical Union]] government of [[Milan Stojadinovi<U+0107>]],{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=52}} and was known for his hostility to the [[Yugoslav Communist Party]], which made him popular with conservatives such as the Yugoslav Radical Union.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=19}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=120}}

==World War II==

Shortly before the [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]] of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Pe<U+0107>anac was requested by the [[Ministry of Defense (Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav Ministry of the Army and Navy]] to prepare for guerrilla operations and guard the southern area of Serbia, Macedonia, and Kosovo from pro-Bulgarians and pro-Albanians in the region.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=126}} He was given arms and money, and managed to arm several hundred men in the [[Toplica (river)|Toplica River]] valley in southern Serbia.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=126}} Pe<U+0107>anac's force remained intact after the German occupation of Serbia and supplemented its strength from Serb refugees fleeing Macedonia and Kosovo.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=126}} In the early summer of 1941 Pe<U+0107>anac's detachments fought against Albanian bands.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=126}} At this time and for a considerable time after, only detachments under Pe<U+0107>anac were identified by the term  "Chetnik".{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=127}} With the formation of the communist [[Yugoslav Partisans]], Pe<U+0107>anac gave up any interest in resistance and by late August came to agreements with both the Serbian puppet government and the German authorities to carry out attacks against the Partisans.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=127}}{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=21}}

On 18 August 1941, while he was concluding arrangements with the Germans, Pe<U+0107>anac received a letter from [[Dra<U+017E>a Mihailovi<U+0107>]] requesting an agreement be reached where Pe<U+0107>anac would control the Chetniks south of the [[West Morava|Western Morava River]] while Mihailovi<U+0107> would control the Chetniks in all other areas.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=127<U+2013>128}} Pe<U+0107>anac declined his request and suggested that he might offer Mihailovi<U+0107> the [[chief of staff]] position and recommended Mihailovi<U+0107>'s detachments disband and join his detachments. In the meantime, Pe<U+0107>anac had arranged for the transfer of several thousand of his Chetniks to the Serbian Gendarmerie to act as German auxiliaries.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=183}}
[[File:Proclamation issued by Kosta Pecanac.jpg|thumb|alt=a copy of the proclamation by Pe<U+0107>anac|Pe<U+0107>anac's "Proclamation to the Dear People"]]
On 27 August, Pe<U+0107>anac issued an open "Proclamation to the Dear People", in which he portrayed himself as the defender and protector of Serbs and called "on detachments that have been formed without his approval" to come together under his command. He demanded that individuals hiding in the forests return to their homes immediately and that acts of sabotage on occupation authorities cease or suffer the punishment of death.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=128}}

In September 1941, some of Pe<U+0107>anac's subordinates broke ranks to join with the Partisans in fighting the Germans and their Serbian auxiliaries. In the Kopoanik region, a previously loyal subordinate of Pe<U+0107>anac began attacking local gendarmerie stations and clashing with armed bands of Albanian Muslims. By the end of October the Germans decided to stop arming the "unreliable" elements within Pe<U+0107>anac's Chetniks, and attached the remainder to their other Serbian auxiliary forces.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=28<U+2013>29}}

On 7 October 1941, Pe<U+0107>anac sent a request to the head of the [[Government of National Salvation|Serbian puppet government]], [[Milan Nedi<U+0107>]] for stronger organization, supplies, arms, salary funds, and more. Over time his requests were fulfilled and a German [[liaison officer]] was appointed at Pe<U+0107>anac's headquarters to help coordinate actions. On 17 January 1942, according to German data, 72 Chetnik officers and 7,963 men were being provided for by the Serbian [[Gendarmerie]] Command. This fell short of the maximum authorized size of 8,745 men and included two or three thousand of Mihailovi<U+0107>'s Chetniks who were legalized in November 1941.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=127}} In the same month, Pe<U+0107>anac sought permission from the Italians for his forces to move into eastern [[Kingdom of Montenegro (1941<U+2013>1944)|Montenegro]], but was refused over Italian concerns that the Chetniks would move into the [[Sand<U+017E>ak]].{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=44<U+2013>45}}

In April 1942, the German Commanding General in Serbia, ''General der Artillerie'' (General) [[Paul Bader]], issued orders giving unit numbers C{{ndash}}39 to C{{ndash}}101 to the Pe<U+0107>anac Chetnik detachments, which were put under the command of the local German division or area command post. These orders also required the deployment of a German liaison officer with all detachments engaged in operations, and limited their movement outside their assigned area. Supply of arms and ammunition was also controlled.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=195}} In July 1942, Mihailovi<U+0107> arranged for the Yugoslav government-in-exile to denounce Pe<U+0107>anac as a traitor,{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=63}} and his continuing collaboration ruined what remained of the reputation he had developed in the Balkan Wars and World War I.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=59}}

The Germans soon found that Pe<U+0107>anac's units were inefficient, unreliable, and of little military aid to them. Pe<U+0107>anac's Chetniks regularly clashed and had rivalries with other German auxiliaries such as the [[Serbian State Guard]] and [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Command]] and also with Mihailovi<U+0107>'s Chetniks.{{sfn|Lazi<U+0107>|2011|pp=29<U+2013>30}} The Germans and the puppet government commenced disbanding them in September 1942, and all but one was dissolved by the end of 1942. The last detachment was dissolved in March 1943. His followers were dispersed to other German auxiliary forces, German labour units, and prisoner-of-war camps. Many deserted to join Mihailovi<U+0107>. Nothing is known of Pe<U+0107>anac's activities in the months that followed except that he was interned for some time by the Serbian puppet government.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=128, 195}}

==Death==
Accounts of Pe<U+0107>anac's capture and death vary. According to one account, Pe<U+0107>anac, four of his leaders and 40 of their followers were captured by forces loyal to Mihailovi<U+0107> in February 1944. All were killed within days except Pe<U+0107>anac, who remained in custody to write his war memoirs before being executed on 5 May 1944.{{sfn|Lazi<U+0107>|2011|pp=29<U+2013>30}} Another source states he was assassinated on 6 June 1944 by Chetniks loyal to Mihailovi<U+0107>.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=260}}
