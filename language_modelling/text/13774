'''''Astraea''''' is the third studio album by British [[mathcore]] band [[Rolo Tomassi]]. It was released on 5 November 2012 in the United Kingdom through Destination Moon, the band's own record label. In interviews, the band described the composition of the album as being much more accessible and direct than their previous albums, while retaining the technical and [[experimental music|experimental]] elements of their typical sound. The album was produced by Jason Sanderson, the producer of Rolo Tomassi's first album [[Hysterics (Rolo Tomassi album)|Hysterics]]. This is the band's first release with Chris Cayford and Nathan Fairweather in their line-up after the departure of Joseph Thorpe and Joe Nicholson.

The album was recorded in various locations across Nottingham, United Kingdom including James Spence's house and [[The Bodega]] club night venue. This was because the band's producer, Sanderson had come into contractual issues with the land owner of his recording studio. The album was critically acclaimed, praised for both its increased accessibility, sonic development and the increased use of Eva Spence's singing. However, the album performed poorly commercially, failing to chart or make significant sales in upon its release.

==Background==
Rolo Tomassi only completed one short tour of the United Kingdom in 2011. They spent all the year preparing for their new album and the creation of Destination Moon, the band's own record label. They released a [[compilation CD]], ''[[Eternal Youth (Rolo Tomassi album)|Eternal Youth]]'', in mid-2011 to compile selected works from their numerous [[split EP]]s, [[Demo (music)|demos]] and out-of-print extended plays. When asked about leaving [[Hassle Records|Hassle]] to form their own record label, the band stated "We were questioning what we were doing for our label that we couldn't do ourselves. We've always been very proactive with the running of our band and we've never given away much freedom."<ref name="NME-hard hitting">{{cite web|url = http://www.nme.com/news/rolo-tomassi/61820| title = Rolo Tomassi promise a 'hard-hitting' and 'more direct' third album | work = [[NME]]| date = 3 February 2012| accessdate = 4 February 2012}}</ref> The band announced in early February 2012 that both Joseph Thorpe and Joe Nicholson had left the band. This was because Joe Nicholson wanted to read chemistry at university, while Thorpe's reasons were related to personal differences.<ref name="Stencil-12"/> The band replaced both with Chris Cayford, who is the current frontman and former guitarist of No Coast, and Nathan Fairweather, who plays in Brontide,<ref name="NME-hard hitting"/> making this the first release with the new line-up.

The title of the album has been cited as having several origins. Some have suggested it gets its name from the Greek goddess of justice [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]].<ref name="Nicolson"/> Another possibility is [[ASTRAEA]], (Autonomous Systems Technology Related Airborne Evaluation & Assessment) an acronym for the development of British [[unmanned aerial vehicle]].<ref name="Doran"/> The album's title acted as a reference to the Spence siblings' admiration for [[greek mythology]] and a desire to pick an title that made the album "sound big and like this proper body of work".<ref name="clash-scales"/> James Spence described ''Astraea'' and the band's previous album [[Cosmology (album)|Cosmology]] as being "really grand titles".<ref name="clash-scales"/>

Writing for the album started as early as July 2011. James Spence also had stated that in that period the band have at least two songs written with the lyrics being self-reflective, a common theme for the band's music.<ref name="Soundsphere mag 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.soundspheremag.com/interviews/59-features/2302-interview-rolo-tomassi-sonisphere-2011|title=Interview: Rolo Tomassi Sonisphere 2011|author=Nico Davidson |publisher=[[Sound Sphere Magazine]] |date= 27 July 2011|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref> Around this time as well, Rolo Tomassi expressed interest in working with [[Anthony Gonzalez (musician)|Anthony Gonzalez]] or [[Kurt Ballou]] respectively of [[M83 (band)|M83]] and [[Converge (band)|Converge]] as producers for the third album. However at the time insufficient progress had been made for them to search for producers.<ref name="NME-producer search">{{cite web|url =http://www.nme.com/news/rolo-tomassi/57874|title= Rolo Tomassi at Sonisphere: 'We'd love to make a record with M83 or Converge' | publisher= [[NME]]|accessdate = 28 September 2011| date = 9 July 2011}}</ref> James Spence had said that with this record he wished to experiment with [[shoegaze]], "dreamy keyboard[s]" and utilising more melodic passages.<ref name="The Boar 2013"/> Spence has also commented that "quite progressive synth-based music" such as M83 and the horror film soundtracks [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]] have produced acted as influences.<ref name="Pitchfork Interview"/>

Because all the members were working their band schedule round their jobs they had to practice in basic recording rooms and write and record their own ideas. From this the members listened to each other's ideas and gave their interpretations and evaluations. Synthesiser player James felt the band produced their best work with this method as they were constantly assessing themselves.<ref name="Brighton noise-interview"/>

In the writing of previous albums by Rolo Tomassi a majority of the music was written by James and Eva Spence wrote most of the lyrics. For ''Astraea'', the band treated it as a collaboration between all five members; however James and Cayford were the "main brains".<ref name="DIY-Power in hands"/> In January 2012, in an interview with [[Kerrang!]], Eva Spence confirmed that the band are self-producing their third full-length with ''[[Hysterics (Rolo Tomassi album)|Hysterics]]'' producer Jason Sanderson.<ref name="Kerrang 1397"/> The choice of returning to Sanderson was because he has been a close friend of the band members for a long time.<ref name="Stencil-12">{{cite web| ref=harv | url = http://www.issuu.com/stencilmag/docs/issue12 | title = Issue 12 of Stencil Mag | author = Robert Knapper | publisher = [[Stencil Magazine]], Inc  |pages = 22<U+2013>23 | date = 20 March 2012 | accessdate = 21 May 2013}}</ref> Regarding the sound of the album, she stated that it will be "more direct and heavier", but also noted that the band "will never shy away from being experimental".<ref name="Kerrang 1397">{{cite journal | date = January 14, 2012 | title = In the studio special <U+2013> Rolo Tomassi | journal = [[Kerrang!]] | issue = 1397 | pages = page07 | publisher = [[Bauer Media Group]] | editor = James McMahon | issn = 0262-6624 }}</ref> However, James Spence went on record saying that during the actual production of the album the band did not consider themselves as part of the overall production; rather just having a say in every aspect of the album progress.<ref name="Brighton noise-interview">{{cite web|url = http://www.brightonnoise.co.uk/interview/?p=30366| title =  Interview: Rolo Tomassi | author = Chris Poots | work = [[Brighton Noise]] | publisher = | date = 26 October 2012| accessdate = 2013-05-19 | quote = }}</ref> In April 2012, the [[NME]] did a studio update with on the album with James Spence stating that the band's writing was "70% complete". He credited how the new members Chris and Nathan "breathed new life" into the band's writing as the original three members had become "too set in their ways".<ref name="NME-too set">{{cite web| url = http://www.nme.com/news/rolo-tomassi/63427 | title = Rolo Tomassi on their line-up changes: 'We'd become too set in our ways' | work = [[NME]] | publisher = [[IPC Media]] | date = 24 April 2012 | accessdate = 22 May 2012 }}</ref> The band members have commented that this has made the writing a lot more fun as the band no longer writes a song then learns it.<ref name="DIY-Power in hands"/> As the band wrote ''Astraea'' they decided to contrast with their typical style more with the clean and ethereal parts, which led to an increase of Eva's [[singing]].<ref name="clash-scales"/>

They started recording ''Astraea'' in June<ref name="NME-too set"/> at James Spence's house in [[Nottingham]].<ref name="Nationalstudent-2013Interview"/> They were forced into this situation as Sanderson's recording studio was taken from him through a contractual issue on the building with the [[landlord]].<ref name="DIY-Power in hands">{{cite web|url = http://www.thisisfakediy.co.uk/articles/features/rolo-tomassi-the-power-is-in-your-hands/ | title = Rolo Tomassi: <U+2018>The Power Is In Your Hands<U+2019> | author = Simone Scott Warren | work = [[This Is Fake DIY]] | date = 5 November 2012 | accessdate = 26 June 2013 }}</ref> The recording process was different to previous albums as there was a lot of [[Music production|production]] and [[pre-production]] involved.<ref name="Brighton noise-interview"/> Sanderson would come to the practice sessions of the bands and make suggestions to the songs and then they'd go to record it.<ref name="Brighton noise-interview"/> The album took three months to record because of band member's personal commitments, this to James Spence had a positive effect as the members took their time with the music, believing the album was more <U+201C>produced<U+201D> than previous efforts.<ref name="Brighton noise-interview"/> James believed Rolo Tomassi had much more of an opportunity to experiment in the studio and try things they had never tried before.<ref name="clash-scales"/> However, James had commented that the recording of the album in his house revealed to be a stressful decision.<ref name="Nationalstudent-2013Interview"/> An example of this was were his basement- where all the recording equipment was- flooded due to heavy rainfall.

Much like the band's previous work Astraea is considered primarily as [[mathcore]].<ref name="Nationalstudent-2013Interview"/><ref name="Aylott"/> This is displayed in the theoretical complexity of their music, such as odd [[time signatures]] like 9/13,<ref name="Beat generator">{{cite web|url = http://www.thecourier.co.uk/lifestyle/entertainment/music/review-rolo-tomassi-at-beat-generator-live-1.90624| title = Review: Rolo Tomassi at Beat Generator Live | author = Martin Dalziel | work = [[The Courier]] | publisher = [[D.

She was quoted saying that the album is much more accessible than their previous albums: "You can get your teeth into it much quicker, people who didn't have patience before with our music before will be into this record. It's still technical, but we're using the [[math rock|mathy]] bits more sparingly."<ref name="NME-too set"/>

The album opens out with 'Howl', a grinding, but graceful opener.<ref name="fly- live 2013"/> The song starts with an opening two minutes of intense and spacious drone [[synthesisers]]. The following two minutes of the song break into "unrelenting and brutal" mathcore with Eva Spence making her vocal debut with her "gleefully guttural vocal register".<ref name="Aylott"/> The song is used as an example of how the band is using more complex, but 'more rewarding' song structures in their music.<ref name="Gardner"/> <U+2018>Ex Luna Scientia<U+2019>, the opening single for the album is seen as a more expansive and more melodic song in comparison to their previous work, placing emphasis on Eva Spence<U+2019>s singing rather than her trademark 'guttural' style.<ref name="Nicolson"/> [[Rock Sound]] reviewer Oliver Robertson used the song as an example for the sonic development of the album as it is "more focused on making each element stand out now, rather than creating simply a cacophony of noise."<ref name="Robertson"/> The introduction to 'Empiresk' is seen as being "completely caked in [[reverb]]" and ends with a [[stoner rock|stoner]] [[guitar riff|riff]].<ref name="Metal hammer-pod review"/> The "sparse piano chords" that open both 'Empiresk' and 'Prelude II', among the atmospheric breaks that are featured on other tracks on the album defy the aggression featured on the rest of Astraea.<ref name="Macmillan"/> Songs like 'The Scales of Balance', 'Remancer' and 'Gloam' are seen as having a fimiliar style to the Rolo Tomassi's previous work.<ref name="Gardner"/> 'Gloam', specifically the last half of the song, showcases a "battle between melodic keyboard[s] and screamed vocals with a real sense of urgency and threat."<ref name="Macmillan"/> 'Remancer' sepcifically has been considered as almost like [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]].<ref name="Metal hammer-pod review"/> The album closes with 'Illuminare', a song which Metal Hammer reviewer Merlin Alderslade cites as showing Radiohead and Sigur R<U+00F3>s influences.<ref name="Metal hammer-pod review"/>

Lyrically, Eva Spence credited on how the ''Astraea'' was a lot more positive than their previous material due to having time off between tours and being able to relax in the writing process. "I feel happier than I have done in the past few years. I'm seeing things in a positive light and I hope the lyrics will be more uplifting"<ref name="Kerrang 1397"/> In an interview with James Spence about the early writing process and how the lyrics have an essence of self-reflection as a common theme in the band's work, "it's not something people normally look at or focus on; self-reflection as a theme, but if you ignore what's happening to you and how it's making you think about things then I don't think that's good."<ref name="Soundsphere mag 1"/>

==Release and promotion==
In early February 2012, Rolo Tomassi announced the release of a new single: '[[Old Mystics]]'. 'Old Mystics' and its [[B-side]] 'Mesmerizer' was written by synthesiser play James Spence in the earliest stages of the ''Astraea's'' writing, in late 2011.<ref name="Stencil-12"/> The single was uploaded to the band's [[Facebook]] profile to stream for free.

The album received critical acclaim from popular critics. [[BBC]] issued a very much favourable review of the album as writer Noel Gardner praised Rolo Tomassi as remaining a "remarkably singular band" three albums into their career.<ref name="Gardner"/> [[Drowned In Sound]] writer Pieter Macmillan commented positively on their use of vocals on the album saying "having male and female vocals and the ability to switch from singing to screaming and back again immediately creates a rich and textured sonic world if it<U+2019>s done well, as it certainly is here."<ref name="Macmillan"/>

[[The Fly (magazine)|The Fly]] magazine gave the album a four out of five star rating summarising the album as "blissed-out ecstasy".<ref name="Fly review"/> [[New Musical Express]] writer Barry Nicolson gave the album an 8 out of 10 and drew parallels between the album titles name, being derived from the [[Astraea (mythology)|Greek goddess of justice]] by concluding his review with "If there is any justice in the world, here<U+2019>s an album richly deserving of some."<ref name="Nicolson"/> [[Metal Hammer]] reviewers praised the album for its increase in 'clean vocals' and less disjointed song writing but still being heavy.<ref name="Metal hammer-pod review"/>

John Doran of online magazine [[The Quietus]] gave the album a glowing review expecting it to appear in his publicationsend of year lists, describing it in summary as a triumph: "Rolo Tomassi are miles ahead of the game not just because they are constantly trying to break new ground but also because they have entered a nuclear arms race of progressiveness with their own back catalogue."<ref name="Doran"/> Oliver Robertson when writing for [[Rock Sound]] magazine gave the album a 7 out of 10 and started his review by praising the band saying "deviating little from the blueprint while making some of the finest mathcore albums of the past few years". Considering the album as a sign of Rolo Tomassi maturing as a band.<ref name="Robertson"/>
