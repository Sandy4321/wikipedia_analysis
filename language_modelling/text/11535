'''''Prinz Eugen''''' ({{IPA-de|<U+02C8>p<U+0281><U+026A>nts <U+0254><U+028F><U+02C8><U+0261>e<U+02D0>n}}) was an [[Admiral Hipper class cruiser|''Admiral Hipper''-class]] [[heavy cruiser]], the third member of the class of five vessels. She served with the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Kriegsmarine]] during [[World War II]]. The ship was laid down in April 1936 and launched August 1938; ''Prinz Eugen'' entered service after the outbreak of war, in August 1940. The ship was named after [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]], an 18th century Austrian [[General officer|general]]. 

''Prinz Eugen'' saw extensive action during [[Operation Rhein<U+00FC>bung]], an attempted breakout into the Atlantic Ocean with the battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] in May 1941. The two ships engaged the British battlecruiser {{HMS|Hood|51|2}} and battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}} in the [[Battle of Denmark Strait]], during which ''Hood'' was destroyed and ''Prince of Wales'' was severely damaged. ''Prinz Eugen'' was detached from ''Bismarck'' during the operation to raid Allied merchant shipping, but this was cut short due to engine troubles. After putting in to occupied France and undergoing repairs, the ship participated in [[Operation Cerberus]], a daring daylight dash through the [[English Channel]] back to Germany. In February 1942, ''Prinz Eugen'' was deployed to Norway, although her time stationed there was cut short when she was torpedoed by the British submarine {{HMS|Trident|N52|2}} days after arriving in Norwegian waters. The torpedo severely damaged the ship's stern, which necessitated repairs in Germany. 

Upon returning to active service, the ship spent several months training new [[officer cadet]]s in the Baltic before serving as artillery support to the retreating German Army on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. After the German collapse in May 1945, the ship was surrendered to the British [[Royal Navy]] before being transferred to the [[US Navy]] as a [[war prize]]. After examining the ship in the United States, the US Navy assigned the cruiser to the [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests in the [[Bikini Atoll]]. After surviving both atomic blasts, ''Prinz Eugen'' was towed to [[Kwajalein Atoll]] where she ultimately capsized and sank in December 1946. The wreck remains partially visible above the water; one of her screws was salvaged and is on display at the [[Laboe Naval Memorial]] in Germany.

==Construction==
{{main|Admiral Hipper class cruiser}}
[[File:Admiral Hipper ONI.jpg|thumb|left|Recognition drawing of an ''Admiral Hipper'' class cruiser]]

''Prinz Eugen'' was ordered by the Kriegsmarine from the [[Germaniawerft]] shipyard in [[Kiel]].<ref name=G65>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 65</ref> Her keel was laid on 23 April 1936,<ref name=W37>Williamson, p. 37</ref> under construction number 564.<ref name=G65/> She was originally to be named after [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]], the Austrian victor of the [[Battle of Lissa]], though considerations over the possible insult to Italy, defeated by Tegetthoff at Lissa, led to the Kriegsmarine to adopt [[Prince Eugene of Savoy|Prinz Eugen]] as the ship's namesake.<ref>Schmalenbach, pp. 121&ndash;122</ref> The ship was launched on 22 August 1938, and was completed two years later, on 1 August 1940, the day she was commissioned into the German fleet.<ref name=G67>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 67</ref> As built, the ship had a straight [[Stem (ship)|stem]], though after her launch this was replaced with a [[clipper]] bow. A raked funnel cap was also installed.<ref>Williamson, p. 35</ref>

''Prinz Eugen'' was {{convert|207.7|m|ft|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a beam of {{convert|21.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a maximum draft of {{convert|7.2|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The ship had a design displacement of {{convert|16970|MT|abbr=on}} and a full load displacement of {{convert|18750|LT|abbr=on}}. ''Prinz Eugen'' was powered by three sets of geared [[steam turbine]]s, which were supplied with steam by twelve ultra-high pressure oil-fired [[boiler]]s. The ship's top speed was {{convert|32|kn|lk=on}}, at {{convert|132000|shp|lk=on}}.<ref name=G65/> As designed, her standard complement consisted of 42 officers and 1,340 enlisted men.<ref name=G66>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 66</ref>

''Prinz Eugen''{{'}}s primary armament was eight [[20.3 cm SK C/34 naval gun|{{convert|20.3|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} SK L/60]] guns mounted in four twin [[gun turret]]s, placed in [[superfire|superfiring pairs]] forward and aft.<ref group=Note>"L/60" denotes the length of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibers]]. The length of 60 caliber gun is 60 times greater than it is wide in diameter</ref> Her anti-aircraft battery was to have consisted of twelve {{convert|10.5|cm|abbr=on}} L/65 guns, twelve {{convert|3.7|cm|abbr=on}} guns, and eight {{convert|2|cm|abbr=on}} guns. The ship also would have carried a pair of triple {{convert|53.3|cm|abbr=on}} torpedo launchers abreast of the rear superstructure. The ship was to have been equipped with three [[Arado Ar 196]] seaplanes and one catapult.<ref name=G66/> ''Prinz Eugen''{{'}}s [[belt armor|armored belt]] was {{convert|70|to|80|mm|abbr=on}} thick; her upper deck was {{convert|12|to|30|mm|abbr=on}} thick while the main armored deck was {{convert|20|to|50|mm|abbr=on}} thick. The main battery turrets had {{convert|105|mm|abbr=on}} thick faces and 70&nbsp;mm thick sides.<ref name=G65/>

==Service history==
[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-63-14, Kiel, Kreuzer "Prinz Eugen", Stapellauf.jpg|thumb|right|''Prinz Eugen''{{'}}s launch]]
In early July 1940, shortly before her commissioning, ''Prinz Eugen'' was attacked by British bombers; the ship was struck by only one bomb.<ref name=S140>Schmalenbach, p. 140</ref> She was not seriously damaged, however, and was commissioned into service the following month. ''Prinz Eugen'' spent the remainder of 1940 conducting [[sea trials]] in the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref name=W37/> In early 1941, the ship's artillery crews conducted gunnery training. A short period in dry dock for final modifications and improvements followed.<ref>Williamson, pp. 37&ndash;38</ref> In April, the ship joined the newly commissioned battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] for maneuvers in the Baltic. The two ships had been selected for [[Operation Rhein<U+00FC>bung|Operation ''Rhein<U+00FC>bung'']], a breakout into the Atlantic to raid Allied commerce.<ref name=W38>Williamson, p. 38</ref>

On 23 April, while passing through the [[Fehmarn]] Belt en route to [[Kiel]],<ref name=S140/> ''Prinz Eugen'' detonated a magnetic mine dropped by British aircraft. The mine caused serious damage, including a ruptured fuel tank, damaged propeller shaft couplings,<ref name=W38/> and damaged fire control equipment.<ref name=S140/> The planned sortie with ''Bismarck'' was delayed while repairs were carried out.<ref name=W38/> Admirals [[Erich Raeder]] and [[G<U+00FC>nther L<U+00FC>tjens]] discussed the possibility of delaying the operation further, in the hopes that repairs to the battleship [[German battleship Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] would be completed or ''Bismarck''{{'}}s sistership [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] would complete trials in time for the ships to join ''Prinz Eugen'' and ''Bismarck''. Raeder and L<U+00FC>tjens decided that it would be most beneficial to resume surface actions in the Atlantic as soon as possible, however, so the two ships would sortie without reinforcement.<ref>Von M<U+00FC>llenheim-Rechburg, p. 60</ref>

===Operation ''Rhein<U+00FC>bung''===
{{main|Operation Rhein<U+00FC>bung}}
By 11 May, repairs to ''Prinz Eugen'' were completed. The ship steamed to [[Gotenhafen]], where her crew readied the ship for the sortie. On 18 May, ''Prinz Eugen'' rendezvoused with ''Bismarck'' off [[Cape Arkona]].<ref name=W38/> The two ships were escorted by three destroyers<U+2014>[[German destroyer Z10 Hans Lody|''Hans Lody'']], [[German destroyer Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt|''Friedrich Eckoldt'']], and [[German destroyer Z23|''Z23'']]<U+2014>and a flotilla of minesweepers.<ref>Von M<U+00FC>llenheim-Rechburg, p. 76</ref> The [[Luftwaffe]] provided air cover during the voyage out of German waters.<ref name=GD214>Garzke & Dulin, p. 214</ref> At around 13:00 on 20 May, the German flotilla encountered the Swedish cruiser {{HMS|Gotland|1933|6}}; the cruiser shadowed the Germans for two hours in the [[Kattegat]].<ref name=BH65>Bercuson & Herwig, p. 65</ref> ''Gotland'' transmitted a report to naval headquarters, stating: "Two large ships, three destroyers, five escort vessels, and 10<U+2013>12 aircraft passed [[Marstrand]], course 205<U+00B0>/20'."<ref name=GD214/> The OKM was not concerned about the security risk posed by ''Gotland'', though L<U+00FC>tjens believed operational security had been lost.<ref name=BH65/> The report eventually made its way to Captain Henry Denham, the British naval attach<U+00E9> to Sweden, who transmitted the information to the [[Admiralty]].<ref>Bercuson & Herwig, pp. 66<U+2013>67</ref> 

The code-breakers at [[Bletchley Park]] confirmed that an Atlantic raid was imminent, as they had decrypted reports that ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' had taken on prize crews and requested additional navigational charts from headquarters. A pair of [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s were ordered to search the Norwegian coast for the German flotilla.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig, p. 68</ref> On the evening of 20 May, ''Prinz Eugen'' and the rest of the flotilla reached the Norwegian coast; the minesweepers were detached and the two raiders and their destroyer escorts continued north. The following morning, radio-intercept officers on board ''Prinz Eugen'' picked up a signal ordering British reconnaissance aircraft to search for two battleships and three destroyers northbound off the Norwegian coast.<ref>Zetterling & Tamelander, p. 114</ref> At 7:00 on the 21st, the Germans spotted four unidentified aircraft, though they quickly departed. Shortly after 12:00, the flotilla reached [[Bergen]] and anchored at [[Grimstadfjord]]. While there, the ships' crews painted over the Baltic camouflage with the standard "outboard gray" worn by German warships operating in the Atlantic.<ref>Von M<U+00FC>llenheim-Rechburg, p. 83</ref>

While in Bergen, ''Prinz Eugen'' took on {{convert|764|MT|abbr=on}} of fuel; ''Bismarck'' inexplicably failed to similarly refuel.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig, p. 71</ref> At 19:30 on 21 May, ''Prinz Eugen'', ''Bismarck'', and the three escorting destroyers left port.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig, p. 72</ref> By midnight, the force was in the open sea and headed toward the Arctic Ocean. At this time, Admiral Raeder finally informed Hitler of the operation, who reluctantly allowed it to continue as planned. The three escorting destroyers were detached at 04:14 on 22 May, while the force steamed off [[Trondheim]]. At around 12:00, L<U+00FC>tjens ordered his two ships to turn toward the Denmark Strait to attempt the breakout into the open waters of the Atlantic.<ref>Garzke & Dulin, p. 215</ref>

[[File:Rheinuebung Karte.png|thumb|right|Map showing the movements of ''Prinz Eugen'', ''Bismarck'', and their British pursuers]]

By 04:00 on 23 May, L<U+00FC>tjens ordered ''Prinz Eugen'' and ''Bismarck'' to increase speed to {{convert|27|kn|abbr=on}} to make the dash through the Denmark Strait.<ref name=GD216>Garzke & Dulin, p. 216</ref> Upon entering the Strait, both ships activated their FuMo radar detection equipment sets.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig, p. 126</ref> ''Bismarck'' led ''Prinz Eugen'' by about {{convert|700|m|abbr=on}}; mist reduced visibility to {{convert|3000|to|4000|m|abbr=on}}. The Germans encountered some ice at around 10:00, which necessitated a reduction in speed to {{convert|24|kn|abbr=on}}. Two hours later, the pair had reached a point north of Iceland. The ships were forced to zigzag to avoid ice floes. At 19:22, hydrophone and radar operators aboard the German warships detected the cruiser {{HMS|Suffolk|55|6}} at a range of approximately {{convert|12500|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=GD216>Garzke & Dulin, p. 216</ref> ''Prinz Eugen''{{'}}s radio-intercept team decrypted the radio signals being sent by ''Suffolk'' and learned that their location had indeed been reported.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig, pp. 126<U+2013>127</ref>

Admiral L<U+00FC>tjens gave permission for ''Prinz Eugen'' to engage ''Suffolk'', though the captain of the German cruiser could not clearly make out his target and so held his ship's fire.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig, p. 127</ref> ''Suffolk'' quickly retreated to a safe distance and shadowed the German ships. At 20:30, the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Norfolk|78|6}} joined ''Suffolk'', but approached the German raiders too closely. L<U+00FC>tjens ordered his ships to engage the British cruiser; ''Bismarck'' fired five salvoes, three of which straddled ''Norfolk'' and rained shell splinters on her decks. The cruiser laid a smoke screen and fled into a fog bank, ending the brief engagement. The concussion from the 38&nbsp;cm guns firing disabled ''Bismarck''{{'}}s FuMo 23 radar set; this prompted L<U+00FC>tjens to order ''Prinz Eugen'' to take station ahead so she could use her functioning radar to scout for the formation.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig, pp. 129<U+2013>130</ref> 

The cruisers remained in their stations through the night, continually relaying the location and bearing of the German ships. The harsh weather broke on the morning of 24 May, revealing a clear sky. At 05:07 that morning, hydrophone operators aboard ''Prinz Eugen'' detected a pair of unidentified vessels approaching the German formation at a range of {{convert|20|nmi|abbr=on}}, reporting "Noise of two fast-moving turbine ships at 280<U+00B0> relative bearing!".<ref>Bercuson & Herwig, pp 133<U+2013>134</ref> At 05:45, lookouts on the German ships spotted smoke on the horizon; these turned out to be from {{HMS|Hood|51|2}} and {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}}, under the command of Admiral [[Lancelot Holland]]. L<U+00FC>tjens ordered his ships' crews to battle stations. By 05:52, the range had fallen to {{convert|26000|m|abbr=on}} and ''Hood'' opened fire, followed by ''Prince of Wales'' a minute later.<ref>Garzke & Dulin, pp. 219<U+2013>220</ref> ''Hood'' engaged ''Prinz Eugen'', which the British thought to be ''Bismarck'', while ''Prince of Wales'' fired on ''Bismarck''.{{#tag:ref|The British were unaware that the German ships had reversed positions while in the Denmark Strait. Observers on ''Prince of Wales'' correctly identified the ships, but failed to inform Admiral Holland.<ref>Zetterling & Tamelander, p. 165</ref>|group=Note}}

The British ships approached the German ships head on, which permitted them to use only their forward guns, while ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' could fire full [[broadside]]s. Several minutes after opening fire, Holland ordered a 20<U+00B0> turn to port, which would allow his ships to engage with their rear gun turrets. Both German ships concentrated their fire on ''Hood''; about a minute after opening fire, ''Prinz Eugen'' scored a hit with a high-explosive {{convert|20.3|cm|abbr=on}} shell; the explosion detonated [[Unrotated Projectile]] ammunition and started a large fire, which was quickly extinguished.<ref>Garzke & Dulin, p. 220</ref> Holland then ordered a second 20<U+00B0> turn to port, to bring his ships on a parallel course with ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen''. By this time, ''Bismarck'' had found the range to ''Hood'', so L<U+00FC>tjens ordered ''Prinz Eugen'' to shift fire and target ''Prince of Wales'' to keep both of his opponents under fire. Within a few minutes, ''Prinz Eugen'' scored a pair of hits on the battleship and reported a small fire to have been started.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig, pp. 151<U+2013>153</ref>

[[File:Sinking of HMS Hood.jpg|thumb|left|Painting by J.C. Schmitz-Westerholt depicting the ''Prince of Wales'' manoeuvring to avoid the sinking ''Hood'']]
L<U+00FC>tjens then ordered ''Prinz Eugen'' to drop behind ''Bismarck'', so she could continue to monitor the location of ''Norfolk'' and ''Suffolk'', which were still some {{convert|10|to|12|nmi|abbr=on}} to the east. At 06:00, ''Hood'' was completing the second turn to port when ''Bismarck''{{'}}s fifth salvo hit. Two of the shells landed short, striking the water close to the ship, but at least one of the 38&nbsp;cm [[armor-piercing shot and shell|armour-piercing]] shells struck ''Hood'' and penetrated her thin deck armor. The shell reached ''Hood''{{'}}s rear ammunition magazine and detonated {{convert|112|MT|abbr=on}} of [[cordite]] propellant.<ref name=BH153>Bercuson & Herwig, p. 153</ref> The massive explosion broke the back of the ship between the main mast and the rear funnel; the forward section continued to move forward briefly before the in-rushing water caused the bow to rise into the air at a steep angle. The stern similarly rose upward as water rushed into the ripped-open compartments.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig, pp. 155<U+2013>156</ref> In only eight minutes of firing, ''Hood'' had disappeared, taking all but three of her crew of 1,419 men with her.<ref name=GD223>Garzke & Dulin, p. 223</ref>

After a few more minutes fighting, during which ''Prince of Wales'' scored three hits on ''Bismarck'', the battered British battleship withdrew. The Germans ceased fire as the range widened, though Captain [[Ernst Lindemann]], ''Bismarck''{{'}}s commander, strongly advocated chasing ''Prince of Wales'' and destroying her.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig, pp. 162<U+2013>165</ref> L<U+00FC>tjens firmly rejected the request, and instead ordered ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' to head for the open waters of the North Atlantic.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig, pp. 165<U+2013>166</ref> After the end of the engagement, L<U+00FC>tjens reported that a "Battlecruiser, probably ''Hood'', sunk. Another battleship, ''King George V'' or ''Renown'', turned away damaged. Two heavy cruisers maintain contact."<ref>Bercuson & Herwig, p. 167</ref> At 08:01, he transmitted a damage report and his intentions to OKM, which were to detach ''Prinz Eugen'' for commerce raiding and to make for [[St. Nazaire]] for repairs.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig, p. 168</ref> Shortly after 10:00, L<U+00FC>tjens ordered ''Prinz Eugen'' to fall behind ''Bismarck'' to discern the severity of the oil leakage from the bow hit. After confirming that "broad streams of oil on both sides of [''Bismarck''{{'}}s] wake",<ref name=BH173>Bercuson & Herwig, p. 173</ref> ''Prinz Eugen'' returned to the forward position.<ref name=BH173/>

With the weather worsening, L<U+00FC>tjens attempted to detach ''Prinz Eugen'' at 16:40. The squall was not heavy enough to cover her withdrawal from Wake-Walker's cruisers, which continued to maintain radar contact. ''Prinz Eugen'' was therefore recalled temporarily.<ref>Zetterling & Tamelander, pp. 192<U+2013>193</ref> The cruiser was successfully detached at 18:14. ''Bismarck'' turned around to face the Wake-Walker's formation, forcing ''Suffolk'' to turn away at high speed. ''Prince of Wales'' fired twelve salvos at ''Bismarck'', which responded with nine salvos, none of which hit. The action diverted British attention and permitted ''Prinz Eugen'' to slip away.<ref>Garzke & Dulin, p. 227</ref>

On 26 May, ''Prinz Eugen'' rendezvoused with the supply ship ''Spichern'' to refill her nearly-empty fuel tanks.<ref name=S141>Schmalenbach, p. 141</ref> The ship had suffered serious defects in her propulsion system, which necessitated a return to occupied France for repairs. On 31 May, the ship was joined by an escort of destroyers off the coast of France;<ref name=W39>Williamson, p. 39</ref> The following day, she put into [[Brest, France|Brest]].<ref name=S141/> Repairs lasted for the next eight months, during which ''Prinz Eugen'' and the other German warships in the area were repeatedly attacked by Allied bombers.<ref name=W39/> On the night of 1&ndash;2 July,<ref name=S141/> the ship was struck by bombs that killed or injured over 100 men.<ref name=W39/>

===Operation ''Cerberus''===
{{Main|Channel Dash}}
By 1942, the battleships ''Scharnhorst'' and [[German battleship Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']] had joined ''Prinz Eugen'' in Brest. The ships were continually threatened by Allied air attacks, and so [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered their return to Germany.<ref>Williamson, pp. 39&ndash;40</ref> The intention was to deploy the vessels to Norway to interdict Allied convoys to the Soviet Union.<ref name=GD146>Garzke & Dulin, p. 146</ref> Hitler insisted they would make the voyage via the [[English Channel]], despite the protests of Raeder.<ref name=W40>Williamson, p. 40</ref> Vice Admiral [[Otto Ciliax]] was given command of the operation. In early February, [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]] swept a route through the [[English Channel]], though the British failed to detect the activity.<ref name=GD146/>

At 23:00 on 11 February, ''Scharnhorst'', ''Gneisenau'', and ''Prinz Eugen'' left Brest. They entered the Channel an hour later; the three ships sped at {{convert|27|kn|abbr=on}}, hugging the French coast along the voyage. By 06:30, they had passed [[Cherbourg]], at which point they were joined by a flotilla of torpedo boats.<ref name=GD146/> The torpedo boats were led by ''[[Kapit<U+00E4>n]]'' [[Erich Bey]], aboard the destroyer [[German destroyer Z29|''Z29'']]. ''[[General der Jagdflieger]]'' (General of Fighter Force) [[Adolf Galland]] directed Luftwaffe fighter and bomber forces ([[Operation Donnerkeil]]) during ''Cerberus''.<ref>Hooton 1997, pp. 114-115.</ref> The fighters flew at masthead-height to avoid detection by the British radar network. Liaison officers were present on all three ships. German aircraft arrived later to jam British radar with [[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]].<ref name=GD146/> By 13:00, the ships had cleared the [[Strait of Dover]], though half an hour later, a flight of six Swordfish torpedo bombers, with [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] escort, attacked the Germans. The British failed to penetrate the Luftwaffe fighter shield, and all six Swordfish were destroyed.<ref>Hooton 1997, p. 114.</ref><ref>Weal 1996, p. 17.</ref>

Off Dover, ''Prinz Eugen'' came under fire from British coastal artillery batteries, though they scored no hits. Several [[Motor Torpedo Boat]]s then attacked the ship, but ''Prinz Eugen''{{'}}s destroyer escorts drove the vessels off before they could launch their torpedoes. At 16:43, ''Prinz Eugen'' encountered five British destroyers: {{HMS|Campbell||2}}, {{HMS|Vivacious||2}}, {{HMS|Mackay||2}}, {{HMS|Whitshed|D77|2}}, and {{HMS|Worcester|D96|2}}. She fired her main battery at them and scored several hits on ''Worcester'', but she was forced to maneuver erratically to avoid their torpedoes.<ref name=S142>Schmalenbach, p. 142</ref> Nevertheless, ''Prinz Eugen'' arrived in [[Brunsb<U+00FC>ttel]] on the morning of 13 February, completely undamaged.<ref name=W40/>

===Subsequent operations===
On 21 February 1942, ''Prinz Eugen'', the heavy cruiser [[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|''Admiral Scheer'']], and the destroyers [[German destroyer Z4 Richard Beitzen|''Richard Beitzen'']], [[German destroyer Z5 Paul Jakobi|''Paul Jakobi'']], [[German destroyer Z25|''Z25'']], [[German destroyer Z7 Hermann Schoemann|''Hermann Schoemann'']], and [[German destroyer Z14 Friedrich Ihn|''Friedrich Ihn'']] steamed to Norway.<ref>Rohwer, p. 146</ref> After stopping briefly in Grimstadtfjord, the ships proceeded on to Trondheim. Two days later, while steaming off the [[Drontheim Fjord]], the British submarine {{HMS|Trident|N52|2}} torpedoed ''Prinz Eugen''.<ref name=S142/> The torpedo struck the ship in the stern, causing serious damage and rendering the ship unmaneuverable. She was towed to [[Lofjord]], where, over the span of the next few months, emergency repairs were effected. Her entire stern was cut away and plated over and two jury-rigged rudders, operated manually via [[Capstan (nautical)|capstans]], were installed.<ref name=W40/>

On 16 May, ''Prinz Eugen'' made the return voyage to Germany under her own power. While en route to Kiel, the ship was attacked by a British force of 19 bombers and 27 torpedo bombers, though they failed to hit the ship.<ref name=S142/> ''Prinz Eugen'' was out of service for repairs until October; she conducted sea trials beginning on 27 October. Over the next two months, the ship was occupied with lengthy trials in the Baltic. In early January 1943, the Kriegsmarine ordered the ship to return to Norway to reinforce the warships stationed there. Twice in January ''Prinz Eugen'' attempted to steam to Norway with ''Scharnhorst'', but both attempts were broken off after British surveillance aircraft spotted the two ships. After it became apparent that it would be impossible to move the ship to Norway, ''Prinz Eugen'' was assigned to the Fleet Training Squadron. For nine months, she cruised the Baltic training new cadets.<ref name=W41>Williamson, p. 41</ref>

As the [[Soviet Army]] pushed the [[Wehrmacht]] back on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], it became necessary to reactivate ''Prinz Eugen'' as a gunnery support vessel. Therefore, on 1 October 1943, the ship was reassigned to combat duty.<ref name=W41/> In June 1944, ''Prinz Eugen'', the heavy cruiser [[German cruiser Deutschland|''L<U+00FC>tzow'']], and the [[6th Destroyer Flotilla]] formed the Second Task Force, later renamed the Thiele Task Force. ''Prinz Eugen'' was at this time steaming in the eastern Baltic, northwest of the island of [[Ut<U+00F6>, Finland|Ut<U+00F6>]]. On 19&ndash;20 August, the ship steamed into the [[Gulf of Riga]] and bombarded [[Tukums]].<ref name=S143>Schmalenbach, p. 143</ref> Four destroyers supported the action, along with ''Prinz Eugen''{{'}}s Ar 196 floatplanes.<ref name=W41/> ''Prinz Eugen''{{'}}s bombardment was instrumental in the successful repulse of the Soviet attack.<ref>Rohwer, p. 351</ref>

In early September, ''Prinz Eugen'' supported a failed attempt to seize the fortress island of [[Hogland]]. The ship then returned to Gotenhafen, before escorting a convoy of ships evacuating German soldiers from Finland.<ref name=W41/> The convoy, consisting of six freighters, sailed on 15 September from the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], with the entire Second Task Force escorting it. Swedish aircraft and destroyers shadowed the convoy, but did not intervene. The following month, ''Prinz Eugen'' returned to gunfire support duties. On 11 and 12 October, the ship fired in support of German troops in [[Memel]].<ref name=S143/> Over the first two days, the ship fired some 700 rounds of ammunition from her main battery. She returned on the 14th and 15th, after having restocked her main battery ammunition, to fire another 370 rounds.<ref name=W41/>

While on the return voyage to Gotenhafen on 15 October, ''Prinz Eugen'' inadvertently rammed the light cruiser [[German cruiser Leipzig|''Leipzig'']] [[amidships]] north of [[Hela]].<ref name=W41/> The collision occurred due to heavy fog.<ref>Rohwer, p. 363</ref> The light cruiser was nearly cut in half,<ref name=W41/> and the two ships remained wedged together for fourteen hours.<ref name=S143/> ''Prinz Eugen'' was taken to Gotenhafen where repairs were effected in the span of a month.<ref name=W41/> On 20&ndash;21 November, the ship supported German troops on the [[Sworbe Peninsula]] by firing around 500 rounds of main battery ammunition. She then returned to Gotenhafen to resupply and have her worn out gun barrels re-bored.<ref name=W41/>

The ship was ready for action by mid-January 1945, when she was sent to bombard Soviet forces in [[Samland]].<ref>Williamson, p. 41&ndash;42</ref> The ship fired over 870 rounds of ammunition at Soviet forces in [[Cranz]] advancing on [[K<U+00F6>nigsberg]]. At that point, ''Prinz Eugen'' had expended her main battery ammunition, but critical munition shortages forced the ship to remain in port until March, when she bombarded Soviet forces around Gotenhafen, [[Danzig]], and Hela.<ref name=W42>Williamson, p. 42</ref> The following month, on 8 April, ''Prinz Eugen'' and ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' steamed to [[Swinem<U+00FC>nde]].<ref name=S143/> On 13 April, 34 [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] attacked the two ships while in port. Thick cloud cover forced the British to abort the mission and return two days later. On the second attack, they succeeded in sinking ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' with a single [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy bomb]] hit.<ref>Rohwer, p. 409</ref> ''Prinz Eugen'' then departed Swinem<U+00FC>nde for [[Copenhagen]],<ref name=S143/> arriving on 20 April. Once there, she was decommissioned on 7 May and turned over to [[Royal Navy]] control the following day.<ref name=W42/>

On 27 May 1945, ''Prinz Eugen'' and the light cruiser [[German cruiser N<U+00FC>rnberg|''N<U+00FC>rnberg'']] were escorted by the British cruisers {{HMS|Dido|37|2}} and {{HMS|Devonshire|39|2}} to [[Wilhelmshaven]]. On 13 December, the ship was awarded as a [[war prize]] to the United States, which sent the ship to [[Weserm<U+00FC>nde]].<ref name=S143/> The cruiser was commissioned into the U.S. Navy as the [[unclassified miscellaneous vessel]] '''USS ''Prinz Eugen''''' (IX-300). A composite American-German crew, under the command of Captain A. H. Graubart,<ref name=DANFS>{{cite web|title=Prinz Eugen|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/p12/prinz_eugen.htm|publisher=[[Naval History & Heritage Command]]|accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref> then took the ship to [[Boston]], departing on 13 January 1946 and arriving on 22 January.<ref name=S143/> There, the ship was extensively examined by the [[US Navy]].<ref name=W42/> Her very large GHG passive [[sonar]] array was removed and installed on the submarine {{USS|Flying Fish|SS-229|6}} for testing.<ref>Friedman, p. 62</ref> American interest in [[magnetic amplifier]] technology increased again after findings in investigations of the fire control system of ''Prinz Eugen''.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Geyger |first1= William A. |authorlink1= |title= Magnetic-Amplifier Circuits |edition= 2nd |year= 1957 |origyear= 1954 |publisher= McGraw-Hill Book Company |location= New York, New York |id= Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 56-12532 |page= 11 |chapter= Historical Development of Magnetic-amplifier Circuits |quote= One reason for the increased interest in magnetic amplifiers in this country was the successful German development work for various military applications, especially for naval fire-control systems, as used on the German heavy cruiser "Prinz Eugen." |ref= geyger |laysummary= |laydate= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Black |first1= A.

The ship was then allocated to the fleet of target ships for [[Operation Crossroads]] in [[Bikini Atoll]]. ''Prinz Eugen'' was towed to the Pacific via [[Philadelphia]] and the [[Panama Canal]].<ref name=DANFS/> The ship survived two atomic bomb blasts, [[Operation_Crossroads#Test_Able|Test Able]], on 1 July 1946, and [[Operation_Crossroads#Test_Baker|Test Baker]] on 25 July. ''Prinz Eugen'' was thoroughly contaminated with radioactive fallout, but suffered no structural damage from the explosions.<ref name=Conways>Gardiner and Chesneau, p. 229</ref> The irradiated ship was towed to the [[Kwajalein Atoll]] in the central Pacific, where a small leak went unrepaired.<ref name=L>Lenihan, p. 200</ref> On 29 August 1946, the US Navy decommissioned ''Prinz Eugen''.<ref name=Conways/>

By late December 1946, the ship was in very bad condition; on the 21st, the ship began to list severely.<ref name=DANFS/> A salvage team could not be brought to Kwajalein in time,<ref name=Conways/> so the US Navy attempted to beach the ship to prevent her from sinking, but on 22 December, ''Prinz Eugen'' capsized and sank.<ref name=DANFS/> Her main battery gun turrets fell out of their [[barbette]]s when the ship rolled over. The ship's stern, including her propeller assemblies, remain visible above the surface of the water.<ref name=L/> The US Government denied salvage rights, on the grounds that it did not want the irradiated steel entering the market.<ref name=Conways/> In August 1979, one of the ship's screws was retrieved and placed in the [[Laboe Naval Memorial]] in Germany.<ref name=G67/>
