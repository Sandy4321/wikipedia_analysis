The [[kite]] can be used for many applications. Air kites, water kites, bi-media kites, fluid kites, gas kites, kytoons, paravanes, soil kites, solid kites, and plasma kites have niche applications that are furthering the interests of humans in both peace and conflict. Non-human-made kites have applications; some spiders make use of kiting.

'''Anne Qu<U+00E9>m<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>''' has crossed solo the Atlantic Ocean using power kites. And on 4 November 2008, she started her bid to cross the Pacific Ocean under power kites as sailing power to pull her in her small boat called ''Oceankite''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anne-quemere.com |title=Pacific Solo |publisher=Anne-quemere.com |date=6 June 2011 |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref>

Using kites to reduce the work done by an engine in propelling a cargo ship is an idea that is gaining traction as a result of increasing fuel prices and environmental concerns. For example, SkySails GmbH have developed technology that they estimate can reduce fuel usage by 10-35% per day on average<ref>http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RL33360.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.skysails.info/english/skysails-marine/skysails-propulsion-for-cargo-ships/advantages/</ref>. A trial on board the MS Beluga resulted in fuel savings estimated to be worth <U+00A3>800 per day<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7205217.stm</ref>. This particular technology earned the company a sustainable shipping award for "Environmental Technology of the Year" in 2011<ref>http://www.skysails.info/english/company/awards/sustainable-shipping-award/</ref>.

The idea of using wind power for ships is, of course, nothing new. However, using large kites has several significant advantages over traditional sails:
*A well designed kite can generate up to 25 times more power per unit area than a sail<ref>http://www.skysails.info/english/skysails-marine/skysails-propulsion-for-cargo-ships/advantages/</ref> for several reasons:
**Kites can be flown high above the ship, taking advantage of stronger, steadier winds. For example, a kite flying on a 200m line will have twice as much wind energy available to it as a kite on a 10m line<ref>http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080208/full/news.2008.564.html</ref>.
**A kite can be maneuvered to optimise its position in the airflow.
**A kite's shape is designed to both block air in the manner of a a traditional sail and to function like an aerofoil, resulting in combined forces of lift and drag pulling the boat through the water<ref>http://iospress.metapress.com/content/crprx6wjl5vgderj/</ref>.
*All that is needed to operate the kite is a winch and a storage area located towards the front of the ship, which can be fitted with little modification and at low cost. A sail, however, requires a mast to be installed, which is much more expensive and reduces the cargo area on the deck of the ship.<ref>http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RL33360.pdf</ref>
**In addition, masts and sails can act as very large levers, effectively destabilising the ship in severe conditions.

==Advertising / promotional==
Kites can also be used as light-effect carrier, e.g., by carrying light-sticks or battery-powered light effects. Promotional kites: Companies buy large quantities of kites that feature their advertisement. Messages are sometimes displayed by lighting systems that are built into the kite system.

Many kite stores fly kites regularly so that people will see the kites; one of the final purposes is for the store to profit from the flying of the kites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdkf.org/performers/ |title=Kite Performers |publisher=Fdkf.org |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref> Kites are necessary to increase sales of kites.

===Extreme sports===
[[Kite boarding]], [[kite surfing]], kite buggying, kite buggy jumping, [[kite landboarding]], freestyle kite landboarding, [[snow kiting]] or snowkiting, downhill speed kiting, [[hang gliding]], and kite high jumping are among the extreme kite sports wherein competitions are held.

===Competitive stunt-kiting===
[[Peter Powell (kite)|Peter Powell]]'s development and promotion  of two-line stunt kites or [[sport kite]]s help to move stunt kiting into a popular activity as well as a competitive sport. Also, the parafoil stunt kites feed the same sporting activity. Events for kites of more than two control lines are common. The four-line Revolution kite has been setting new standards in precision flying. Informal field competition and formal sport competition support a stunt-kite industry; seemingly endless refinements to the kite wing and kite line along with accessories continue unabated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seattleairgear.com/ |title=Wild Dance Parafoil Stunt Kites |publisher=Seattleairgear.com |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.easternleague.net/pdffiles/SpectatorsGuide.pdf Spectator<U+2019>s Guide to Sport Kite Competition]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref>

Kites have been used for military uses in the past for signaling, for delivery of munitions, for free-flight kiting payloads from aircraft to ground positions, for kiting troops to points where they could parachute to destinations, for underwater kiting via [[Paravane (weapon)|paravanes]] to perform various underwater duties, for lifting payloads from one point to another, for raising rescue signals from rafts or stressed areas, for raising communications antenna, and for observation  by lifting an observer above the field of battle, and by using [[kite aerial photography]]. Barrage kites have been used in both open frame kites and kytoon types to defense against enemy aircraft.

Kites have been used for scientific purposes, such as [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s famous experiment proving that [[lightning]] is electricity.  Kites were the precursors to aircraft, and were instrumental in the development of early flying craft. [[Alexander Graham Bell]] experimented with very large [[man-lifting kite]]s, as did the [[Wright brothers]] and [[Lawrence Hargrave]].

Both air and hydro kites are used to generate electricity; the kite is set in the stream of air or water; various schemes are used to extract some of the stream's energy for converting that energy to electricity.

A major research and development project called [[Makani Power]], based in California and funded by [[Google.org]], is investigating the use of kites in harnessing high altitude wind currents to generate electricity.<ref name="Makani Power website">{{cite web|url=http://www.makanipower.com/ |title=Makani Power website |publisher=Makanipower.com |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref>

===Radio aerials and light beacons===
Kites can be used for radio purposes, by kites carrying antennas for MF, LF or VLF-transmitters. This method was used for the reception station of the first transatlantic transmission by Marconi. [[moored balloon|Captive balloons]] may be more convenient for such experiments, because kite carried antennas require a lot of wind, which may be not always possible with heavy equipment and a ground conductor. It must be taken into account during experiments, that a conductor carried by a kite can lead to a high voltage toward ground, which can endanger people and equipment, if suitable precautions (grounding through resistors or a parallel resonant-circuit tuned to transmission frequency) are not taken.

Kites can be used to carry light effects such as lightsticks or battery powered lights.

==In nature==

[[Image:Leaf suspended in spider web.jpg|thumb|left|Leaf tethered in breeze by spider web.]]
There are natural kites that play a part in shaping what happens on earth. Some leaves kite to relieve wind pressures, pump fluids, and to disconnect annually to fertilize the soils. Poet Pablo Rosenblueth expressed his understanding that children see leaves as kites. Poet Marvin Bell recognized leaves are kites in his ''Nightworks: Poems 1962<U+2013>2000''. The leaf wafts kitingly in the wind held by the tethered leaf stem; when it is fall time, the leaf stem has a de-mooring disconnect process; the wind then easily interracts with the leaf to cause it to fly off the trees and into a gliding fall to the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ncnatural.com/wildflwr/fall/science.html |title=The Scientific Basis For Autumn |publisher=Ncnatural.com |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref> There is a following of kite makers that bridle leaves to fly them again as kites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiteman.co.uk/Indonisiankites.html |title=Indonesian Kites |publisher=Kiteman.co.uk |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.drachen.org/journals/a10/CavePainting.pdf Just How Old Is This Kite Cave Painting?

===Spiders===
{{main|Ballooning (spider)}}
Billions of spiders use kiting to travel, disperse or to build bridge lines for their webs. Spiders hanging in the moving air on their silks are deflected to various points where they make anchor points for web building.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Gvrt2eIVG7YC&pg=PT24&lpg=PT24&dq=spider+ballooning+is+really+kiting&source=web&ots=wHpCpxCy3r&sig=srQgV7Hf_SzOfhOSjrKvI9YKdwg&hl=en |title=Spiders By Ann R.
