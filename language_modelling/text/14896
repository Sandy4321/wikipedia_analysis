'''Warren Allen Morton''' ([[March 22]], [[1924]]&ndash;[[February 18]], [[2002]])<ref name=ssdi>Social Security Death Index: http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi?lastname=Morton&firstname=Warren&start=21</ref> was a [[Casper, Wyoming|Casper]] [[oil]]man and [[engineer]] who served as [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[Wyoming House of Representatives]] from 1979 to 1980, prior to mounting a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]  [[gubernatorial]] campaign in 1982. He served in the Wyoming House from [[Natrona County, Wyoming|Natrona County]] from [[January 1]], [[1967]], to [[December 31]], [[1980]]. Morton was the managing partner of MKM Oil Company in Casper, the seat of Natrona County in eastern [[Wyoming]] and the second largest city in the state.

==Early years, education, family, military==

Morton was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], the seat of [[Jefferson County, Alabama|Jefferson County]] and the largest [[city]] in [[Alabama]], to Lindley C. Morton of [[California]] and the former Ruth Goddard,<ref>Google Books>http://books.google.com/books?id=uHqVYTkA08YC&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=Warren+Goddard+Morton&source=web&ots=BlWtcXxFGm&sig=FPpWxp6LwSYE6SIPx0axX81t6PA&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=2&ct=result#PPA204,M1</ref> a native of [[Connecticut]]. Lindley and Ruth moved to Alabama because of his job with Portland Cement Company. The Mortons returned to California and reared their family of three sons and a daughter. Morton's brothers were Robert Morton and Coleman Morton (1919&ndash;2006), both of [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]; his surviving sister is Sylvia Morton Kingsley of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].<ref name=statement>Statement of Katharine Allen Morton, [[September 24]], [[2008]]</ref>
 
Morton graduated from the [[Hotchkiss School]], a [[boarding school]] for boys, since [[coeducational]], located in [[Lakeville, Connecticut|Lakeville]], a [[village]] in [[Litchfield County, Connecticut|Litchfield County]], Connecticut. He then attended [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], from which he graduated in the field of engineering in 1945. Thereafter, from 1945 to 1947, he was an [[ensign]] in the [[United States Navy]], having been commissioned through [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]. In 1948, he married the former Katharine Hancock "Kathy" Allen (born 1926), the daughter of [[Robert G. Allen|Robert Gray Allen]], a former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[U.S. representative]] from [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania|Greensburg]] in western [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name=obit>"Warren A. Morton" [[obituary]], ''[[Casper Star-Tribune]]'', [[February 22]], [[2002]]</ref>  
 
In 1952, Warren and Kathy Morton moved to Casper from [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], California, where Morton had been a petroleum engineer. They had four sons. [[Ted Morton|Frederick Lee "Ted" Morton]] (born 1949 in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]) is a [[political science]] professor on extended leave from the [[University of Calgary]] in [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]], [[Alberta, Canada|Alberta]], [[Canada]], and a member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]]. Allen Morton (born 1951) is a [[merger]]s and acquisitions specialist for Royal Bank in San Francisco. Robert C. "Bob" Morton (born 1953) is an [[Lawyer|attorney]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]. Warren Goddard Morton (born 1957) is a Landman for True Oil Company and resides in Casper.<ref name=statement/><ref name=obit/>

== Morton as House Speaker ==

The fiscally [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] Morton, who was a director of the Wyoming Taxpayers Association, was not otherwise a typical Wyoming Republican. He supported a woman's right to procure an [[abortion]] and [[gun control]] laws, particularly opposed by his state's large community of [[hunter]]s.<ref name=statement/> As House Speaker, his colleagues considered him strict, smart, and fair. [[Tom Stroock]], a former state senator from Casper and a [[United States Ambassador]] to [[Guatemala]], described the former Speaker as "brilliant. . . Warren had an important part to play in the history of Wyoming in the 1970s and 1980s. He was clearly an outstanding Speaker and an excellent legislator," though Stroock said that he did not always agree with Morton's political positions.<ref name=cst>Joan Barron, "Former House Speaker dies at 77: Casper oil man Morton devoted much of life to civic service", ''[[Casper Star-Tribune]]'', February 20, 2002, pp. 1, A14</ref> 

Marlene Simons of [[Beulah, Wyoming|Beulah]], who was a freshman representative when Morton was Speaker, said that he had been a mentor to beginning legislators, seating them among the more experienced lawmakers. "He ran a tight ship. He was a kind, gentle man, but he was stern."<ref name=cst/>

== Gubernatorial campaign ==

Morton easily won the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] [[primary election|primary]] to challenge two-term [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Governor]] [[Edgar Herschler]] of [[Kemmerer, Wyoming|Kemmerer]] in [[Lincoln County, Wyoming|Lincoln County]]. He polled 52,536 votes (74.3 percent). Rex G. Welty (1921&ndash;1992) of [[Afton, Wyoming|Afton]] in Lincoln County received 9,106 ballots (12.9), and Earl A. Johnson drew 9,025 (12.8 percent). [[Nels J. Smith]] of [[Sundance, Wyoming|Sundance]] in northeastern Wyoming, who had been Morton's predecessor as House Speaker, filed for governor but withdrew before the primary. In a nationally Democratic year, Herschler charged that Morton was a tool of the energy interests.<ref name=fof>''Facts on File Yearbook, 1982'', p. 822</ref> Morton was active in the Rocky Mountain Oil and Gas Association, having been the president of the [[interest group]] from 1963 to 1965.<ref name=obit/> In addition to his own MKM company, Morton was a director of the American Petroleum Institute and was the Wyoming representative on the Interstate Oil Compact Commission from 1962 to 1972.<ref name=cst/>

Morton received 62,128 votes (36.9 percent) to Herschler's 106,427 (63.1 percent). Morton polled only 9,592 more votes in the [[general election]] than he had the primary. Herschler, however, received 62,031 more votes in the final round than he had in the Democratic primary against Pat McGuire. Herschler's [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] over Morton was hence almost numerically the same as Morton's total vote in the general election.<ref>''Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections'', 1982 gubernatorial primary and general election returns, pp. 1539, 1608</ref>

Morton ran nearly twelve percentage points behind [[John C. Ostlund]], a former [[Wyoming State Senate|state senator]], who had lost to Herschler in 1978. Of the three Republicans who challenged Herschler, Ostlund had fared best, losing by one percentage point. While Morton lost the governorship, Republican [[U.S. Senator]] [[Malcolm Wallop]] of [[Sheridan, Wyoming|Sheridan]] defeated the Democrat former [[Wyoming State Senate|State Senator]] [[Rodger McDaniel]], 57&ndash;43 percent.<ref>''Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections'', 1978 and 1982</ref> McDaniel had been the Wyoming state coordinator for the unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1980 of Senator [[Edward M. Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]].<ref name=fof/>
 
After his gubernatorial defeat, Morton continued to support Republican candidates in Wyoming, such as U.S. Senators [[Craig Thomas]], [[Alan K. Simpson]], [[Mike Enzi]], and Malcolm Wallop, as well as his state's GOP organization. In 2000, he also donated to then [[U.S. Representative]] [[Rick Lazio]] of [[New York]] in the latter's bid against [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] for the U.S. Senate. In 1979, Morton contributed to the failed presidential bid of former [[Texas]] [[Governor]] [[John B. Connally]] before switching his support to [[Ronald W. Reagan]].<ref>Newsmeat, List of Campaign Contributions:http://www.newsmeat.com/fec/bystate_detail.php?zip=82601&last=MORTON&first=WARREN</ref>

==Death and legacy==
 
Morton had struggled for four years with [[Alzheimer's disease]] and then developed [[Parkinson's disease]]. Wife Kathy recalls that Morton "had a very good sense of humor about it [Alzheimer's]. He was very open and honest."<ref name=cst/> Morton died at the family's winter residence in [[Litchfield Park, Arizona|Litchfield Park]] in [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]] near [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]].<ref>''Casper Star-Tribune'' obituary index, 2002:http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~colbaugh/WYINFO/casper02B.html</ref> He was [[cremation|cremated]]. Memorial services were held at St. Mark's Church in Casper on [[March 2]], 2002.

Morton served on the board of trustees of the two-year [[Casper College]], a [[community college]].<ref>Case law, with trustees of [[Casper College]], including Warren Morton as defendants in a suit:http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=10th&navby=case&no=988074</ref> He was involved in numerous community affairs, including the management of a [[Little League]] [[baseball]] team for seven years. He was a director and past president of the Wyoming Heritage Society. He served on the boards of the United Fund, [[Chamber of Commerce]], and St. Mark's [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] Church.<ref name=obit/>

[[Jim Geringer]], the only Republican since 1975 to have served as governor of Wyoming (1995&ndash;2003), issued a statement on Morton's death: "I'm deeply saddened at the news of Warren Morton's passing. [First Lady] Sherri and I extend our sympathy and support to Katharine and the rest of the family. Warren set a high standard for public service with his involvement in community activities as Speaker of the House . . . , as a member of several committees and study groups, including the Tax Reform 2000 Commission, the Wyoming Futures Project, and the 1991 commission that studied judicial salaries. Warren served out of commitment and compassion. He was a true Wyoming statesman, businessman, and family man. We will certainly miss Warren."<ref name=cst/>
