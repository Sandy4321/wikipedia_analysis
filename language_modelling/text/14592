'''Marcel Janco''' ({{IPA-de|ma<U+0250><U+032F><U+02C8>s<U+025B>l <U+02C8>ja<U+014B>ko|lang}}, {{IPA-fr|ma<U+0281>s<U+025B>l <U+0292><U+0251><U+0303>ko|lang}}, common rendition of the Romanian name '''Marcel Hermann Iancu'''<ref>Sandqvist, p.66, 68, 69</ref> {{IPA-ro|mar<U+02C8>t<U+0361><U+0283>el <U+02C8>herman <U+02C8>ja<U+014B>ku|pron}}, last name also '''Ianco''', '''Janko''' or '''Jancu'''; May 24, 1895 <U+2013> April 21, 1984) was a [[Romania]]n and [[Israel]]i visual artist, architect, art theorist and cultural promoter, known as the co-inventor of [[Dada]]ism and a leading exponent of [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. His first contribution came in the 1910s, when he joined up with poets [[Tristan Tzara]] and [[Ion Vinea]] on the Romanian art magazine ''[[Simbolul]]''. Janco's debut was in [[Art Nouveau]], but he later found his way into [[Futurism]] and [[Expressionism]], before creating the visual context and stagecraft to Tzara's literary Dadaism. He parted in frustration during 1919, when he and painter [[Hans Arp]] founded a Constructivist circle, ''[[Das Neue Leben]]''. Later, Janco and Vinea became editors of ''[[Contimporanul]]'', one of the most firmly established magazines of the Romanian [[avant-garde]], where Janco first publicized his vision of a new and improved [[urban planning]]. Having helped configure ''Contimporanul''{{'}}s agenda into a mix of Constructivism, Futurism and [[Cubism]], Janco designed and built some of the most innovative 20th-century landmarks of downtown [[Bucharest]], and envisioned a "revolution" in the city's development. His other work of the time covered a wide range of media, from [[illustration]] to sculpture and from [[interior design]] to [[oil painting]].

Janco was one of the leading [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jewish]] intellectuals of his generation, and suffered from [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] persecution before and during [[World War II]]. He emigrated to [[British Mandate of Palestine|British Palestine]] in 1941, becoming an Israeli citizen and contributing to the early development of [[Culture of Israel|Israeli Jewish culture]]. For this, he received the [[Dizengoff Prize|Dizengoff]] and [[Israel Prize|State of Israel]] prizes. After 1953 his work centered on the establishment of [[Ein Hod]], an [[art colony]] and utopian experiment, controversially built over a deserted [[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arab]] settlement. 

Marcel Janco was the brother [[Georges Janco|Georges]] and [[Jules Janco]], who were his artistic partners during and after the Dada episode. His brother-in-law and fellow Constructivist promoter was the writer [[Jacques G. Costin]], known as a survivor of 1940s antisemitism.

==Biography==
===Beginnings===
The Janco brothers were born into an [[upper middle class]] family of largely [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]], but practicing, Bucharest Jews, who had exceptionally received [[naturalization]] on Romanian soil.<ref>Sandqvist, p.69, 172, 300, 333, 377</ref> Their father was merchant Hermann Zui Iancu, who traded in textiles; their mother Rachel n<U+00E9>e Iuster, an amateur piano player, was originally from the region of [[Moldavia]].<ref>Sandqvist, p.69, 79</ref> The couple lived outside [[V<U+0103>c<U+0103>re<U+015F>ti, Bucharest|Bucharest's Jewish quarter]], on Decebal Street.<ref name="ts69">Sandqvist, p.69</ref> Born on May 24, 1895, Marcel was the oldest child: Iuliu (Jules) was a year younger, and George(s) was born in 1899; a sister, Lucia, was born in 1900.<ref name="ts69"/> The Iancus changed homes: they moved from Decebal to G<U+00E2>ndului Street, and then finally to Trinit<U+0103><U+0163>ii, where Hermann Iancu built himself one of the largest home-and-garden complexes in early 20th century Bucharest.<ref>Sandqvist, p.69, 103</ref> In 1980, Janco revisited his childhood years, writing: "Born as I was in beautiful Romania, into a family of well-to-do people, I had the fortune of being educated in a climate of freedom and spiritual enlightenment. My mother, [...] possessing a genuine musical talent, and my father, a stern man and industrious merchant, had created the conditions favorable for developing all of my aptitudes. [...] I was of a sensitive and emotional nature, a withdrawn child who was predisposed to dreaming and meditating. [...] I grew up [...] dominated by a strong sense of humanity and social justice. The existence of disadvantaged, weak, people, of impoverished workers, of beggars, hurt me and, when compared to our family's decent condition, awoke in me a feeling of guilt."<ref name="vsconfes">{{ro icon}} Vlad Solomon, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/ARTE-VIZUALE.-Confesiunea-unui-mare-artist*articleID_24829-articles_details.html "Confesiunea unui mare artist"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 559, January 2011</ref>

The future artist studied first at the Gheorghe <U+015E>incai School, discovering his passion for drawing. As a result, Rachel Iancu sent him to train privately with the celebrated Romanian Jewish painter and cartoonist [[Iosif Iser]]<U+2014>as Marcel noted, this was the groundbreaking event of his career.<ref>Sandqvist, p.69-70</ref> In his teenage years, Janco took the opportunity to educate himself during family trips abroad, from [[Austria-Hungary]] to [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]] and the [[Netherlands]].<ref>Sandqvist, p.72</ref> Janco was later enlisted at the [[Gheorghe Laz<U+0103>r National College (Bucharest)|Gheorghe Laz<U+0103>r High School]], and, before 1913, made the acquaintance of several students who would become his artistic companions: Tzara (known then as ''S. Samyro''), Vinea (''Iovanaki''), writers Jacques G. Costin and [[Poldi Chapier]].<ref>Sandqvist, p.72-73</ref> The young painter and Vinea were also friends of pianist [[Clara Haskil]], who was probably the subject of the first-ever published drawing by Janco, which saw print in ''[[Flac<U+0103>ra]]'' magazine (March 1912).<ref name="gsfrondistul">{{ro icon}} [[Geo <U+015E>erban]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Un-profil-Jacques-Frondistul*articleID_6309-articles_details.html "Un profil: Jacques Frondistul"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 144, November 2002</ref><ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.188</ref>   

As a group, the students were under the influence of [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist clubs]], which were at the time the more radical expressions of artistic rejuvenation in Romania. Marcel and Jules Janco's first moment of cultural significance took place in October 1912, when they joined Tzara in editing the Symbolist venue ''[[Simbolul]]'', which managed to receive contributions from some of Romania's leading modern poets, from [[Alexandru Macedonski]] to [[Ion Minulescu]] and [[Adrian Maniu]]. The magazine nevertheless struggled to find its voice, alternating [[modernism]] with the more conventional Symbolism.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.48-54, 100, 412; Pop, "Un 'misionar al artei noi' (I)", p.9; Sandqvist, p.4, 7, 29-30, 75-78, 81, 196</ref> Janco was perhaps the main graphic designer of ''Simbolul'', and he may even have persuaded his wealthy parents to support the venture (which closed down in early 1913).<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.50, 100; Sandqvist, p.73-75</ref> Unlike Tzara, who refused to look back on ''Simbolul'' with anything but embarrassment, Janco was proud of this moment in life, depicting it as his first participation in artistic revolution.<ref>Sandqvist, p.77, 141, 209, 263. See also Pop, "Un 'misionar al artei noi' (I)", p.9</ref>

After the ''Simbolul'' moment, Marcel Janco worked for a while at ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]'' daily, where he took further training in draftsmanship.<ref name="ts78">Sandqvist, p.78</ref> The newspaper took him in as illustrator, probably as a result of intercessions from Vinea, its literary columnist.<ref name="gsfrondistul"/> Their ''Simbolul'' colleague Costin joined them as ''Seara''{{'}}s cultural editor.<ref name="gsfrondistul"/><ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.34, 188</ref> Janco was also a visitor of the literary and art club meeting at the home of controversial politician and Symbolist poet [[Alexandru Bogdan-Pite<U+015F>ti]], who was for a while the manager of ''Seara''.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.39</ref> 

It is possible that, during those years, Tzara and Janco first came to hear and be influenced by the [[Absurdism|absurdist]] prose of [[Urmuz]], the lonesome civil clerk and amateur writer who would later become the hero of Romanian modernism.<ref>Sandqvist, p.227, 234</ref> Years later, in 1923, Janco drew an ink portrait of Urmuz.<ref>Sandqvist, p.226</ref> In maturity, he also remarked that Urmuz was the original rebel figure in [[Romanian literature]].<ref>Sandqvist, p.235</ref> In the 1910s, Janco was also interested in the parallel development of [[French literature]], and read passionately from such authors as [[Paul Verlaine]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]].<ref>Sandqvist, p.67, 78</ref> Another immediate source of inspiration for his attitude on life was provided by [[Futurism]], an [[anti-establishment]] movement created in [[Italy]] by poet [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] and his artists' circle.<ref name="ts237">Sandqvist, p.237</ref>

===Swiss journey and Dada events===
[[File:Hugo Ball Cabaret Voltaire.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Hugo Ball]] in the "bishop dress", 1916]]
Janco eventually decided to leave Romania, probably because he wanted to attend international events such as the ''[[Sonderbund westdeutscher Kunstfreunde und K<U+00FC>nstler|Sonderbund]]'' exhibit, but also because of quarrels with his father.<ref name="ts78"/> In quick succession after the start of [[World War I]], Marcel, Jules and Tzara left Bucharest for [[Zurich]]. According to various accounts, their departure may have been either a search for new opportunities (abundant in cosmopolitan Switzerland)<ref>Sandqvist, p.26, 78, 125</ref> or a discreet [[Pacifism|pacifist]] statement.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.113, 132</ref> Initially, the Jancos were registered with the [[University of Zurich]], where Marcel took Chemistry courses, before applying to study Architecture at the [[ETH Zurich|Federal Institute of Technology]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.111-112, 130; Sandqvist, p.78-80</ref> His real ambition, later confessed, was to pursue more training in painting.<ref name="vsconfes"/><ref name="amdada">{{ro icon}} Alina Mondini, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Dada-traieste*articleID_12817-articles_details.html "Dada tr<U+0103>ie<U+015F>te"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 261, March 2005</ref> The two brothers were soon joined by younger Georges Janco, but all three were left without any financial support when the war began hampering Europe's trade routes; until October 1917, both Jules and Marcel (who found it impossible to sell his various paintings) earned a living as cabaret performers.<ref name="amdada"/><ref>Sandqvist, p.26, 66, 78-79, 190</ref> Marcel was noted for performing selections from [[Romanian folklore]] and playing the [[accordion]],<ref name="pc112">Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.112</ref> as well as for his rendition of ''[[chanson]]s''.<ref name="gsfrondistul"/><ref name="amdada"/> It was during this time that the young artist and his brothers began using the consecrated version of the surname ''Iancu'', probably in hopes that it would sound more familiar to foreigners.<ref>Sandqvist, p.26, 66</ref>

In this context, the Romanians came into contact with [[Hugo Ball]] and the other independent artists plying their trade at the ''Malerei'' building, which soon after became known as ''[[Cabaret Voltaire (Z<U+00FC>rich)|Cabaret Voltaire]]''. Ball later recalled that four "Oriental" men introduced themselves to him late after a show<U+2014>the description refers to Tzara, the older Jancos and, probably, the Romanian painter [[Arthur Segal]].<ref>Sandqvist, p.31. See also Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.112</ref> Ball found the young painter especially pleasant, and was impressed that, unlike his peers, Janco was melancholy rather than ironic; other participants remember him as a very handsome presence in the group, and he allegedly had the reputation of a "lady-killer".<ref>Sandqvist, p.66-67, 97</ref> 

Accounts of what happened next differ, but it is presumed that, shortly after the four new participants were accepted, the performances became more daring, and the transition was made from Ball's Futurism to the virulent [[anti-art]] performances of Tzara and [[Richard Huelsenbeck]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.112-116; Sandqvist, p.31-32</ref> With help from Segal and others, Marcel Janco was personally involved in decorating the ''Cabaret Voltaire''.<ref name="pc112"/> Its hectic atmosphere would inspire Janco to create an eponymous oil painting, dated 1916 and believed to have been lost.<ref>Sandqvist, p.27, 81</ref> He was a major contributor to the cabaret's events: he notably carved the grotesque masks worn by performers on [[stilts]], gave "hissing concerts" and, in unison with Huelsenbeck and Tzara, improvised some of the first (and mostly [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]]) "simultaneous poems" to be read on stage.<ref>Sandqvist, p.32, 35-36, 66-67, 84, 87, 189-190, 253, 259, 261, 265, 300, 332. See also Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.111-113, 155; Pop, "Un 'misionar al artei noi' (I)", p.9</ref> 

His work with masks became especially influential, opening up a new field of theatrical exploration for the [[Dada]]ists (as the ''Cabaret Voltaire'' crew began calling themselves), and earning special praise from Ball.<ref>Harris Smith, p.6, 44</ref> Contrary to Ball's later claim of authorship, Janco is also credited with having tailored the "bishop dress", another one of the iconic products of early Dadaism.<ref>Sandqvist, p.37, 40, 90, 253, 332. See also Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.115</ref> The actual birth of "Dadaism", at an unknown date, later formed the basis of disputes between Tzara, Ball and Huelsenbeck. In this context, Janco is cited as a source for the story according to which the invention of the term "Dada" belonged exclusively to Tzara.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.116; Sandqvist, p.153</ref> Janco also circulated stories according to which their shows were attended for informative purposes by [[Communism|communist]] theorist [[Vladimir Lenin]]<ref>Sandqvist, p.34</ref> and psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]].<ref name="amdada"/> 

His various contributions were harnessed by Dada's international effort of self-promotion. In April 1917, he welcomed the Dada affiliation of Switzerland's own [[Paul Klee]], calling Klee's contribution to the Dada exhibit a "great event".<ref name="kl96">Kay Larson, "Art. Signs and Symbols", in ''[[New York Magazine]]'', March 2, 1987, p.96</ref> His mask designs were popular beyond Europe, and inspired similar creations by [[Mexico]]'s [[Germ<U+00E1>n Cueto]], the "[[Stridentism|Stridentist]]" painter-puppeteer.<ref>Deborah Caplow, ''Leopoldo M<U+00E9>ndez: Revolutionary Art and the Mexican Print'', [[University of Texas Press]], Austin, 2007, p.38.  ISBN 978-0-292-71250-8</ref> The Dadaist popularization effort received lukewarm responses in Janco's native country, where the traditionalist press expressed alarm at being confronted with Dada precepts.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.124-126, 129</ref> Vinea himself was ambivalent about the activities of his two friends, preserving a link with poetic tradition which made his publication in Tzara's press impossible.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.120-124</ref> In a letter to Janco, Vinea spoke about having personally presented one of Janco's posters to modernist poet and art critic [[Tudor Arghezi]]: "[He] said, critically, that you cannot say whether a person is talented or not on the basis of only one drawing. Rubbish."<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.122; Sandqvist, p.84</ref>

Exhibited at the Dada group shows, Janco also illustrated the Dada advertisements, including an April 1917 program which features his sketches of Ball, Tzara and Ball's actress wife [[Emmy Hennings]].<ref>Sandqvist, p.42, 84</ref> The event featured his production of [[Oskar Kokoschka]]'s farce ''Sphinx und Strohmann'', for which he was also the [[Scenic design|stage designer]], and which was turned into one of the most notorious among Dada provocations.<ref>Sandqvist, p.90-91, 261</ref> Janco was the director and mask designer for the Dada production for another one of Kokoschka's plays, ''Job''.<ref>Harris Smith, p.43-44</ref> He also returned as Tzara's illustrator, producing the [[linocut]]s to ''The First Heavenly Adventure of Mr. Antipyrine'', having already created the props for its theatrical production.<ref>Sandqvist, p.84, 147</ref>

==="Two-speeds" Dada and ''Das Neue Leben''===
[[File:Viking Eggeling Generalbass der Malerei.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Viking Eggeling]]'s drawings for a ''Generalbass der Malerei'' ("General Basis of Painting"), 1918]]
As early as 1917, Marcel Janco began taking his distance from the movement he had helped to generate. His work, in both [[woodcut]] and linocut, continued to be used as the illustration to Dada almanacs for another two years,<ref>Sandqvist, p.93</ref> but he was more often than not in disagreement with Tzara, while also trying to diversify his style. As noted by critics, he found himself split between the urge to mock traditional art and the belief that something just as elaborate needed to take its place: in the conflict between Tzara's [[nihilism]] and Ball's [[art for art's sake]], Janco tended to support the latter.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.115, 130, 155, 160-162; Sandqvist, p.93-94</ref> In a 1966 text, he further assessed that there were "two speeds" in Dada, and that the "spiritual violence" phase had eclipsed the "best Dadas", including his fellow painter [[Hans Arp]].<ref>Nicholas Zurbrugg, ''The Parameters of Postmodernism'', [[Taylor & Francis]] e-library, 2003, p.83.  ISBN 0-203-20517-0</ref>

Janco recalled: "We [Janco and Tzara] couldn't agree any more on the importance of Dada, and the misunderstandings accumulated."<ref>Sandqvist, p.94</ref> There were, he noted, "dramatic fights" sparked by Tzara's taste for "bad jokes and scandal".<ref>Pop, "Un 'misionar al artei noi' (I)", p.9</ref> The artist preserved a grudge, and his retrospective views on Tzara's role in Zurich are often sarcastic, depicting him as an excellent organizer and vindictive self-promoter, but not truly a man of culture;<ref>Sandqvist, p.144</ref> a few years into the scandal, he even started a rumor that Tzara was illegally trading in [[opium]].<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Oi<U+015F>teanu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/scriitorii-romani-si-narcoticele-6-avangardistii-4601.html "Scriitorii rom<U+00E2>ni <U+015F>i narcoticele (6). Avangardi<U+015F>tii"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 952, June 2008</ref> As noted in 2007 by Romanian literary historian [[Paul Cernat]]: "All the efforts by Ion Vinea to reunite them [...] would be in vain. Iancu and Tzara would ignore (or banter) each other for the rest of their lives".<ref name="pc130">Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.130</ref> With this split, there came a certain classicization in Marcel Janco's discourse. In February 1918, Janco was even invited to lecture at his ''[[alma mater]]'', where he spoke about modernism and [[authenticity in art]] as related phenomena, drawing comparisons between the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] and [[African art]].<ref>Sandqvist, p.80-81</ref> However, having decided to focus on his other projects, Janco nearly abandoned his studies, and failed his final exam.<ref>Sandqvist, p.81, 84</ref> 

In this context, he moved closer to the cell of post-Dada Constructivists exhibiting collectively as ''Neue Kunst'' ("New Art")<U+2014>Arp, [[Fritz Baumann]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Otto Morach]].<ref>Sandqvist, p.95</ref> As a result, Janco was made a member of ''[[Das Neue Leben]]'' faction, which supported an educational approach to modern art, coupled with [[Socialism|socialist]] ideals and Constructivist aesthetics.<ref>Sandqvist, p.95-97, 190, 264, 342-343; Van der Berg, p.139, 145-147. See also Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.130, 155, 160-161</ref> In its [[art manifesto]], the group declared its ideal of "rebuild[ing] the human community" in preparation for the end of [[capitalism]].<ref>Sandqvist, p.96. See also Van der Berg, p.147</ref> Janco was even affiliated with ''Artistes Radicaux'', a more politically inclined section of ''Das Neue Leben'', where his colleagues included other former Dadas: Arp, Hans Richter, [[Viking Eggeling]].<ref>Van der Berg, p.147-148. See also Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.160-161</ref> The ''Artistes Radicaux'' were in touch with the [[German Revolution of 1918<U+2013>1919|German Revolution]], and Richter, who worked for the short-lived [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]], even offered Janco and the others virtual teaching positions at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts]] under a workers' government.<ref>Van der Berg, p.139</ref>

===Between B<U+00E9>thune and Bucharest===
Janco made his final contribution to the Dada adventure in April 1919, when he designed the masks for a major Dada event organized by Tzara at the Saal zur Kaufleutern, and which degenerated into an infamous mass brawl.<ref>Sandqvist, p.91-92. See also Harris Smith, p.6</ref> By May, he was mandated by ''Das Neue Leben'' to create and publish a journal for the movement. Although this never saw print, the preparations placed Janco in contact with the representatives of various modernist currents: [[Arthur Segal]], [[Walter Gropius]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], [[Oscar L<U+00FC>thy]] and [[Enrico Prampolini]].<ref>Sandqvist, p.97, 190, 342-343</ref> This period also witnessed the start of a friendly relationship between Janco and the [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] artists who published in [[Herwarth Walden]]'s magazine ''[[Der Sturm]]''.<ref name="dg389">Grigorescu, p.389</ref>

A little more than a year after the end of war, in December 1919, Marcel and Jules left Switzerland for [[France]]. After passing through [[Paris]], the painter was in [[B<U+00E9>thune]], where he married Am<U+00E9>lie Micheline "Lily" Ackermann, in what was described as a gesture of fronde against his father. The girl was a [[Roman Catholicism in Switzerland|Swiss Catholic]] of lowly condition, who had first met the Jancos at ''Das Neue Leben''.<ref>Sandqvist, p.97-99</ref> Janco was probably in B<U+00E9>thune for a longer while: he was listed as one of those considered for helping to rebuild war-affected [[French Flanders]], redesigned the Chevalier-Westrelin store in [[Hinges, Pas-de-Calais|Hinges]], and was perhaps the co-owner of an architectural enterprise, ''Ianco & D<U+00E9>quire''.<ref>Sandqvist, p.98-99, 340</ref> It is not unlikely that Janco followed with curiosity the activities of Dada's Parisian cell, which were overseen by Tzara and his pupil [[Andr<U+00E9> Breton]], and he is known to have impressed Breton with his own architectural projects.<ref name="ts98">Sandqvist, p.98</ref> He was also announced, with Tzara, as a contributor to the post-Dada magazine ''[[L'Esprit Nouveau]]'', published by [[Paul Derm<U+00E9>e]].<ref>Meazzi, p.122</ref> Nevertheless, Janco was invited to exhibit elsewhere, rallying with ''[[Section d'Or]]'', a Cubist collective.<ref name="ts98"/>

Late in 1921, Janco and his wife left for Romania, where they had a second marriage to seal their union in front of familial disputes.<ref>Sandqvist, p.99</ref> Janco was soon reconciled with his parents, and, although still unlicensed as an architect, began receiving his first commissions, some of which came from within his own family.<ref name="traseuurban">Doina Anghel, [http://www.e-cart.ro/asociatia/en/news/Urban_route_M.Iancu.pdf ''Urban Route. Marcel Iancu: The Beginnings of Modern Architecture in Bucharest''], E-cart.ro Association, 2008</ref><ref>Sandqvist, p.99, 340</ref> His early contributions, officially registered as the work of one I. Rosenthal, are the rather traditional seven buildings on Hermann Iancu's property, at Trinit<U+0103><U+0163>ii Street, 29<U+2014>one of them became his new home.<ref>Sandqvist, p.340, 344</ref> The site, extended in later years, was completed with new buildings by Janco down to the mid 1930s; this pet project resulted in some of the most experimental buildings in the history of [[Romanian architecture]], in striking contrast with the antique design prevalent in the surrounding [[Hala Traian]] quarter.<ref name="traseuurban"/> Together with Jules, Janco eventually opened up his own business venture, ''Birou de Studii Moderne'' (Office of Modern Studies). It was housed in a building of their own design, at the junction of Caimatei and Trinit<U+0103><U+0163>ii, and officially run by a fictitious person, ''Marcel Iuliu Iancu''.<ref>Sandqvist, p.340-341</ref>

Soon after making his comeback, Marcel Janco reconnected himself with the local [[avant-garde]] salons, and had his first Romanian exhibits, at the ''Maison d'Art'' club in Bucharest.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.178</ref> His friends and collaborators, among them actress [[Dida Solomon]] and journalist-director [[Sandu Eliad]], would describe him as exceptionally charismatic and knowledgeable.<ref name="ts343">Sandqvist, p.343</ref> Around 1926, Janco took commissions as an art teacher at his studio in Bucharest<U+2014>in the words of his pupil, the future painter-photographer [[Hedda Sterne]], these were unimpressive: "We were given easels, etc. but nobody looked, nobody advised us."<ref>Joan Simon, [http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/features/hedda-sterne/ "Hedda Sterne"], in ''[[Art in America]]'', February 1, 2007</ref>

===''Contimporanul'' beginnings===
From his position as Constructivist mentor and international artist, Janco proceeded to network between Romanian modernist currents, and joined up with his old colleague Vinea. Early in 1922, the two men founded a political and art magazine, the influential ''[[Contimporanul]]''<U+2014>historically, the longest-lived venue of the Romanian avant-garde.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.131-132; Sandqvist, p.345</ref> Janco was abroad that year, as one of guests at the First Constructivist Congress, convened by Dutch artist [[Theo van Doesburg]] in [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.155, 164; Sandqvist, p.341</ref> He was in Zurich around 1923, receiving the visit of a compatriot, writer [[Victor Eftimiu]], who declared him a hard-working artist able to reconcile the modern with the traditional.<ref>Sandqvist, p.93-94</ref>

''Contimporanul'' followed Janco's Constructivist affiliation. Initially a venue for socialist satire and political commentary, it reflected Vinea's strong dislike for the ruling [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.130-145, 232-233; Sandqvist, p.343, 348-349</ref> However, by 1923, the journal became increasingly cultural and artistic in its revolt, headlining with translations from van Doesburg and Breton, publishing Vinea's own homage to Futurism, and featuring illustrations and international notices which Janco may have handpicked himself.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.140-147, 157-158, 215-218, 245-268, 410-411; Sandqvist, p.345-348, 350.

Marcel Janco also took charge of ''Contimporanul''{{'}}s business side, designing its offices on Imprimerie Street and overseeing the publication of postcards.<ref>Sandqvist, p.350-351</ref> Over the years, his own contributions to ''Contimporanul'' came to include some 60 illustrations, some 40 articles on art and architectural topics, and a number of his architectural designs or photographs of buildings erected from them.<ref>Sandqvist, p.350</ref> He oversaw one of the journal's first special issues, dedicated to "Modern Architecture", and notably hosting his own contributions to architectural theory, as well as his design of a "country workshop" for Vinea's use.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.162-164</ref> Other issues also featured his essay on film and theater, his furniture designs, and his interview with the French Cubist [[Robert Delaunay]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.166-169</ref> Janco was also largely responsible for the ''Contimporanul'' issue on Surrealism, which included his interviews with writers such as [[Joseph Delteil]], and his inquiry about the publisher [[Simon Kr<U+00E0>]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.216-217</ref> 

Together with Romanian Cubist painter [[M. H. Maxy]], Janco was personally involved in curating the ''Contimporanul'' International Art Exhibit of 1924.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.157; Grigorescu, p.389; Sandqvist, p.351-354</ref> This event reunited the major currents of Europe's modern art, reflecting ''Contimporanul''{{'}}s eclectic agenda and international profile. It hosted samples of works by leading modernists: the Romanians Segal, [[Constantin Br<U+00E2>ncu<U+015F>i]], [[Victor Brauner]], [[J<U+00E1>nos Mattis-Teutsch]], [[Mili<U+0163>a Petra<U+015F>cu]], alongside Arp, Eggeling, Klee, Richter, [[Lajos Kass<U+00E1>k]] and [[Kurt Schwitters]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.157; Sandqvist, p.351</ref> The exhibit included samples of Janco's work in furniture design, and featured his managerial contribution to a Dada-like opening party, co-produced by him, Maxy, Vinea and journalist [[Eugen Filotti]].<ref>Sandqvist, p.351-352</ref> He was also involved in preparing the magazine's theatrical parties, including the 1925 production of ''A Merry Death'', by [[Nikolai Evreinov]]; Janco was the set and [[costume design]]er, and Eliad the director.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.159; Sandqvist, p.351</ref> An unusual echo of the exhibit came in 1925, when ''Contimporanul'' published a photograph of Br<U+00E2>ncu<U+015F>i's ''Princess X'' sculpture. The [[Romanian Police]] saw this as a sexually explicit artwork, and Vinea and Janco were briefly taken into custody.<ref>{{ro icon}} Ioana Paverman, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Pop-Culture*articleID_20264-articles_details.html "Pop Culture"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 436, August 2008; Nicoleta Zaharia, Dan Boicea, [http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/Erotismul-clasicilor_0_26999151.html "Erotismul clasicilor"], in ''[[Adev<U+0103>rul Literar <U+015F>i Artistic]]'', October 8, 2008</ref> Janco was a dedicated admirer of Br<U+00E2>ncu<U+015F>i, visiting him in Paris and writing in ''Contimporanul'' about Br<U+00E2>ncu<U+015F>i's "spirituality of form" theories.<ref>Cristian R.

In their work as cultural campaigners, Vinea and Janco even collaborated with ''75 HP'', a periodical edited by poet [[Ilarie Voronca]], which was nominally anti-''Contimporanul'' and pro-Dada.<ref>Sandqvist, p.357</ref> Janco was also an occasional presence in the pages of ''[[Punct (magazine)|Punct]]'', the Dadaist-Constructivist paper put out by the socialist [[Scarlat Callimachi]]. It was here that he notably published articles on architectural styles and a [[lampoon]], in [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]], titled ''T.S.F. Dialogue entre le bourgeois mort et l'ap<U+00F4>tre de la vie nouvelle'' ("Cablegram.

His portraits of the writers included, drawn in sharply modernist style, were received with amusement by the traditionalist public.<ref name="gt360-361">[[George Top<U+00EE>rceanu]], ''Scrieri'', Vol. II, [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1983, p.360-361.  {{OCLC|10998949}}</ref> In 1926, Janco further antagonized the traditionalists by publishing sensual drawings for [[Camil Baltazar]]'s book of erotic poems, ''Strig<U+0103>ri trupe<U+015F>ti l<U+00EE>ng<U+0103> glezne'' ("Bodily Exhortations around the Ankles").<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/despre_pornografie "Despre pornografie"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 2/2007</ref>

===Functionalist breakthrough===
Profiting from the building boom of [[Greater Romania]], and the rising popularity of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]], Janco's ''Birou'' was in much demand. Compared with mainstream functionalist architects like [[Horia Creang<U+0103>]], [[Arghir Culina]], [[Rudolf Fr<U+00E4>nkel]] or [[Marcel Locar]], the Jancos received commissions that were sparse and small-scale, but they had a decisive role in popularizing the functionalist versions of Constructivism or Cubism.<ref>Sandqvist, p.217, 341-342</ref> Heralding the change of architectural tastes with his articles in ''Contimporanul'', Marcel Janco described Romania's capital as a chaotic, inharmonious, backward town, in which the traffic was hampered by carts and [[tram]]s.<ref>Sandqvist, p.103. See also Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.219</ref> 

A major breakthrough was his Villa Jean Fuchs, built in 1926 on Negustori Street. Its cosmopolitan owner allowed the artist complete freedom in designing the building, purportedly the first Constructivist structure in Bucharest,<ref name="ts341-342">Sandqvist, p.341-342</ref> and a budget of 1 million [[Romanian leu|lei]].<ref name="traseuurban"/> The result caused a stir in the neighborhood, while the press found it to be reminiscent of a "morgue" and a "crematorium".<ref name="traseuurban"/> The architect and his patrons were undeterred by such reactions, and the Janco firm received commissions to build similar villas, as well as the [[Philippe Suchard]] pavilion at the [[Obor]] fair of 1926.<ref name="traseuurban"/>

Until 1934, when Marcel Janco finally received his certification, his designs continued to be officially recorded under different names, most usually attributed to a Constantin Simionescu.<ref name="traseuurban"/> This had little effect on the ''Birou''{{'}}s output: before 1937, Janco and his brother designed some 40 permanent or temporary structures in Bucharest, all of them located in the northern and central areas (the "Yellow" and "Black" sectors, as they were known at the time).<ref name="traseuurban"/> These and other projects also involved the 1924 exhibit's Mili<U+0163>a Petra<U+015F>cu, who is herself better known as a modernist sculptor.<ref>Sandqvist, p.341</ref>

Several other Bucharest homes result from this creative collaboration: the Maria Lambru Villa of 1928, on Popa Savu Street; the Florica Chih<U+0103>escu house on [[<U+015E>oseaua Kiseleff]] (1930); the Jean Juster and Paul Wexler Villas, on Silvestru and Grigore Mora streets, respectively (1931).<ref name="traseuurban"/> Janco also designed a house for his ''[[Simbolul]]'' friend [[Poldi Chapier]]. Located on Ip<U+0103>tescu Alley and finished in 1929,<ref name="traseuurban"/> this was occasionally described as "Bucharest's first Cubist lodging".<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.49, 100</ref> These projects are joined by a private [[sanatorium]] of [[Predeal]], which is the principal of Janco's Constructivist designs outside of Bucharest.<ref name="ts341-342"/>

Janco had one daughter from his marriage to Lily Ackermann, who signed her name Josine Ianco-Starrels (b. 1926), and was raised a Catholic.<ref>Sandqvist, p.97-98, 340, 377</ref> Her sister Claude-Simone had died in infancy.<ref name="ts340">Sandqvist, p.340</ref> By the mid 1920s, Marcel and Lily Janco were estranged: already by the time of their divorce (1930), she was living by herself in a [[Bra<U+015F>ov]] home designed by Janco.<ref name="ts340"/> The artist remarried to Clara "Medi" Goldschlager, the sister of his old friend [[Jacques G. Costin]]. The couple had a girl, Deborah Theodora ("Dadi" for short).<ref name="ts340"/> 

With his new family, Janco lived a comfortable life, traveling throughout Europe and spending his summer vacations in the resort town of [[Balchik|Balcic]].<ref name="ts340"/> In 1931, Janco built himself a new family home, the blockhouse known as "Clara Iancu Building", on Caimatei.<ref name="traseuurban"/> The Jancos and the Costins also shared ownership of a country estate: known as ''Jacquesmara'',<ref name="ts378">Sandqvist, p.378</ref> it was located in [[Comana, Giurgiu|Budeni-Comana]], [[Giurgiu County]].<ref name="vsconfes"/><ref name="gsfrondistul"/> The house is especially known for hosting [[Clara Haskil]] during one of her triumphant returns to Romania.<ref name="gsfrondistul"/>

===Between ''Contimporanul'' and ''Criterion''===
Janco was still active as the art editor of ''Contimporanul'' during its final and most eclectic series of 1929,<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.169-171</ref> when he took part in selecting new young contributors, such as publicist and art critic [[Barbu Brezianu]].<ref>{{ro icon}} Filip-Lucian Iorga, [http://www.romlit.ro/barbu_brezianu "Barbu Brezianu"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 3/2008</ref> At that junction, the magazine triumphantly published a "Letter to Janco", in which the formerly traditionalist architect [[George Matei Cantacuzino]] spoke about his colleague's decade-long contribution to the development of Romanian functionalism.<ref name="traseuurban"/><ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.170-171</ref> Beyond his ''Contimporanul'' affiliation, Janco rallied with the Bucharest collective ''Arta Nou<U+0103>'' ("New Art"), also joined by Maxy, Brauner, Mattis-Teutsch, Petra<U+015F>cu, [[Nina Arbore]], [[Cornelia Babic-Daniel]], [[Alexandru Br<U+0103>t<U+0103><U+015F>anu]], [[Olga Greceanu]], [[Corneliu Mich<U+0103>ilescu]], [[Claudia Millian]], [[Tania <U+015E>eptilici]] and others.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.179. See also Grigorescu, p.442</ref> 

Janco and some other regulars of ''Contimporanul'' also reached out to the Surrealist faction at ''[[unu]]'' review<U+2014>Janco is notably mentioned as a "contributor" on the cover of ''unu'', Summer 1930 issue, where all 8 containing pages were purposefully left blank.<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Ioana P<U+00E2>rvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/nonconformitii "Nonconformi<U+015F>tii"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 26/2001</ref> Janco prepared woodcuts for the first edition of Vinea's novel ''Paradisul suspinelor'' ("The Paradise of Sobs"), printed with [[Editura Cultura Na<U+0163>ional<U+0103>]] in 1930,<ref name="gsberlin">{{ro icon}} [[Geo <U+015E>erban]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Marcel-Iancu-la-Berlin*articleID_21-articles_details.html "Marcel Iancu la Berlin"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 92, November 2011</ref><ref>{{ro icon}} Simona Vasilache, [http://www.romlit.ro/avangarda_napoi "Avangarda <U+00EE>napoi!"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 19/2006</ref> and for Vinea's poems in their magazine versions.<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=155 "Avangarda maghiar<U+0103> <U+00EE>n Contimporanul"], in ''[[Apostrof]]'', Nr. 12/2006</ref> His drawings were used in illustrating two volumes of interviews with writers, compiled by ''Contimporanul'' sympathizer [[Felix Aderca]],<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.313-314; Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu, p.618</ref> and Costin's only volume of prose, the 1931 ''Exerci<U+0163>ii pentru m<U+00E2>na dreapt<U+0103>'' ("Right-handed Exercises").<ref name="gsberlin"/><ref name="pcurmuziene">{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Urmuziene-si-nu-numai*articleID_7322-articles_details.html "Urmuziene <U+015F>i nu numai.

Janco attended the 1930 reunion organized by ''Contimporanul'' in honor of the visiting Futurist [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], and gave a welcoming speech.<ref>Sandqvist, p.237. See also Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.174, 176</ref> Marinetti was again praised by the ''Contimporanul'' group (Vinea, Janco, Petra<U+015F>cu, Costin) in February 1934, in an [[open letter]] stating: "We are soldiers of the same army."<ref>[[Giovanni Lista]], ''Marinetti et le futurisme'', [[L'<U+00C2>ge d'Homme]], Lausanne, 1977, p.239. ISBN 2825124141</ref> These developments created a definitive split in Romania's avant-garde movement, and contributed to ''Contimporanul''{{'}}s eventual fall: the Surrealists and socialists at ''unu'' condemned Vinea and the rest for having established, through Marinetti, a connection with the [[Italian fascism|Italian fascists]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.177, 229-232, 241-244</ref> After the incidents, Janco's art was openly questioned by ''unu'' contributors such as [[Stephan Roll]].<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Geo <U+015E>erban]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Ascensiunea-lui-Dolfi-Trost*articleID_25391-articles_details.html "Ascensiunea lui Dolfi Trost"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 576, May 2011</ref> 

Although ''Contimporanul'' went bankrupt, an artistic faction of the same name survived until 1936.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.179</ref> During the interval, Janco found other backers in the specialized art and architecture magazines, such as ''Ora<U+015F>ul'', ''Arta <U+015F>i Ora<U+015F>ul'', ''[[Rampa (Romanian magazine)|Rampa]]'', ''[[<U+015E>tiin<U+0163><U+0103> <U+015F>i Tehnic<U+0103>|Ziarul <U+015E>tiin<U+0163>elor <U+015F>i al C<U+0103>l<U+0103>toriilor]]''.<ref name="traseuurban"/> In 1932, his villa designs were included by [[Alberto Sartoris]] in his guide to modern architecture, ''Gli elementi dell'architettura razionale''.<ref name="traseuurban"/><ref name="apaparareami">{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Pippidi]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/bordeie-obiceie/articol/apararea-lui-marcel-iancu "<U+00CE>n ap<U+0103>rarea lui Marcel Iancu"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 357, December 2010</ref> The early 1930s also witnessed Janco's participation with the literary and art society ''[[Criterion (literary society)|Criterion]]'', whose leader was philosopher [[Mircea Eliade]].

By that moment in time, the Janco family was faced with the rise of [[antisemitism]], and alarmed by the growth of [[Fascism|fascist]] movements such as the [[Iron Guard]]. In the 1920s, the ''Contimporanul'' leadership had sustained a [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] attack from the traditionalist review ''[[<U+0162>ara Noastr<U+0103>]]'', which cited Vinea's [[Greeks of Romania|Greek]] origins as a cause for concern,<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.207</ref> depicting Janco as the "painter of the cylinder" and the alien, cosmopolitan, Jew.<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Ion Gorun|Alexandru Hodo<U+015F>]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/taranoastra/1924/BCUCLUJ_FP_451581_1924_005_005.pdf "Europenii dela ''Cuv<U+00E2>ntul Liber''"; "<U+00CE>nsemn<U+0103>ri"], in ''[[<U+0162>ara Noastr<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 5/1924, p.138, 156; [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/9787/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_451581_1924_005_006.pdf "Dadaism, cubism, <U+2014> et caetera..."], in ''<U+0162>ara Noastr<U+0103>'', Nr. 6/1924, p.172-173 (digitized by the [[Babe<U+015F>-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])</ref> ''Criterion'' itself split in 1934, when some of its members openly rallied with the Iron Guard, and the radical press accused the remaining ones of promoting [[pederasty]] through their public performances.<ref>Ornea, p.153-156</ref> Josine was expelled from [[Catholic school]] in 1935, the reason invoked being that her father was a Jew.<ref name="ts377">Sandqvist, p.377</ref> For Marcel Janco, the events were an opportunity to discuss his own assimilation into Romanian society: in one of his conferences, he defined himself as "an artist who is a Jew", rather than "a Jewish artist".<ref name="ts377"/> He later confessed his dismay at the attacks targeting him: "nowhere, never, in Romania or elsewhere in Europe, during peacetime or the cruel years of [World War I], did anyone ask me whether I was a Jew or... a kike. [...] [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s Romanian minions managed to change this climate, to turn Romania into an antisemitic country."<ref name="vsconfes"/> The ideological shift, he recalled, destroyed his relationships with the ''Contimporanul'' poet [[Ion Barbu]], who reportedly concluded, after admiring a 1936 exhibit: "Too bad you're a kike!"<ref name="vsconfes"/> At around that time, pianist and fascist sympathizer [[Cella Delavrancea]] also assessed that Janco's contribution to theater was the prime example of "Jewish" and "bastard" art.<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/amazoana_artist "Amazoana artist<U+0103>"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 22/1999</ref>

When the antisemitic [[National Christian Party]] took power, Janco was coming to terms with the [[Zionism|Zionist]] ideology, describing the [[Land of Israel]] as the "cradle" and "salvation" of Jews the world over.<ref name="vsconfes"/><ref name="aomiinedit">{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Oi<U+015F>teanu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/marcel-iancu-inedit-6721.html "Marcel Iancu inedit"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 1022, October 2009</ref> At Budeni, he and Costin hosted [[Betar]] paramilitaries, who were attempting to organize a Jewish self-defense movement.<ref name="vsconfes"/> Janco subsequently made his first trip to [[British Mandate of Palestine|British Palestine]], and began arranging his and his family's relocation there.<ref name="vsconfes"/><ref name="ts378"/><ref name="aomiinedit"/><ref name="gsconstructorul">{{ro icon}} [[Geo <U+015E>erban]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Constructorul-Marcel-Iancu*articleID_25296-articles_details.html "Constructorul Marcel Iancu"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 573, May 2011</ref> Although Jules and his family emigrated soon after the visit, Marcel returned to Bucharest and, shortly before Jewish art was officially censored, had his one last exhibit there, together with Mili<U+0163>a Petra<U+015F>cu.<ref name="ts378"/> He was also working on one of his last, and most experimental, contributions to Romanian architecture: the Hermina Hassner Villa (which also hosted his 1928 painting of the ''[[Jardin du Luxembourg]]''), the Emil Petra<U+015F>cu residence,<ref name="traseuurban"/> and a tower behind the [[Romanian Athenaeum|Atheneum]].<ref name="gspopas">{{ro icon}} [[Geo <U+015E>erban]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Ein-Hod-popas-aniversar*articleID_20285-articles_details.html "Ein Hod <U+2013> popas aniversar"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 436, August 2008</ref> 

In 1939, the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-aligned [[Ion Gigurtu]] cabinet enforced [[Racial antisemitism|racial discrimination]] throughout the land, and, as a consequence, ''Jaquesmara'' was [[Nationalization in Romania|confiscated by the state]].<ref name="ts378"/> Many of the Bucharest villas he had designed, which had Jewish landlords, were also taken over forcefully by the authorities.<ref name="traseuurban"/> Some months after, the [[National Renaissance Front]] government prevented Janco from publishing his work anywhere in Romania, but he was still able to find a niche at ''[[Timpul]]'' daily<U+2014>its [[anti-fascist]] manager, [[Grigore Gafencu]], gave imprimatur to sketches, including the landscapes of Palestine.<ref name="gsconstructorul"/> He was also finding work with the [[ghetto]]ized Jewish community, designing the new [[State Jewish Theater (Romania)|Bara<U+015F>eum Studio]], located in the vicinity of Caimatei.<ref name="gsconstructorul"/>

During his years in British Palestine, Marcel Janco became a noted participant in the development of local Jewish culture.

These contacts were not interrupted by the [[1948 Arab<U+2013>Israeli War]], and Janco was a figure of prominence in the art scene of independent Israel. The new nation enlisted his services as planner, and he was assigned to the team of [[Arieh Sharon]], being tasked with designing and preserving the [[National parks and nature reserves of Israel|Israeli national parks]].<ref name="ezsurrjanko">Esther Zandberg, [http://www.haaretz.com/culture/arts-leisure/surroundings-janko-the-architect-1.169839 "Surroundings.

Marcel Janco began his main Israeli project in May 1953, after he had been mandated by the Israeli government to prospect the mountainous regions and delimit a new national park south of [[Mount Carmel]].<ref>Slyomovics (1995), p.44; Trahair, p.204</ref> In his own account (since disputed by others),<ref name="ezsurrjanko"/> he came across the deserted village of [[Ein Hod]], which the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arabs]] had largely discarded during the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|1948 exodus]]. Janco felt that the place should not be demolished, obtaining a lease on it from the authorities, and rebuilt the place with other Israeli artists who worked there on weekends;<ref>Trahair, p.204</ref> Janco's main residence continued to be in the neighborhood of [[Ramat Aviv]].<ref name="gspopas"/> His plot of land in Ein Hod was previously owned by the Arab Abu Faruq, who died in 1991 at the [[Jenin]] refugee camp.<ref>Slyomovics (2010), p.414</ref> Janco became the site's first mayor, reorganizing it into a utopian society, [[art colony]] and tourist attraction, and instituted the strict code of requirements for one's settlement in Ein Hod.<ref>Trahair, p.113-114, 204</ref> 

Also in the 1950s, Janco was a founding member of ''[[Ofakim Hadashim]]'' ("New Horizons") group, comprising Israeli painters committed to [[abstract art]], and headed by Zaritsky. Although he shared the artistic vision, Janco probably did not approve of Zaritsky's rejection of all [[narrative art]] and, in 1956, left the group.<ref>Manor, p.261, 276</ref><ref name="ngartinisr">Nissim Gal, [http://www.gloria-center.org/meria/2009/03/gal.html "Art in Israel, 1948-2008: A Partial Panorama"], in ''[[Middle East Review of International Affairs]]'', Nr. 1/2009</ref> He continued to explore new media, and, together with artisan [[Itche Mambush]], he created a series of reliefs and [[Tapestry|tapestries]].<ref name="gspopas"/><ref name="lshianco">{{ro icon}} Liana Saxone-Horodi, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Marcel-Ianco-%28Jancu%29-intr-o-noua-prezentare*articleID_25229-articles_details.html "Marcel Ianco (Jancu) <U+00EE>ntr-o nou<U+0103> prezentare"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 571, April 2011</ref> Janco also drew in [[pastel]], and created humorous illustrations to ''[[Don Quixote]]''.<ref name="gsisr2006"/>

His individual contributions received further praise from his peers and his public: in 1958, he was honored with the [[Histadrut]] union's prize.<ref name="jancoimj"/> Over the next two decades, Marcel Janco had several new personal exhibits, notably in Tel Aviv (1959, 1972), [[Milan]] (1960) and Paris (1963).<ref name="aomiinedit"/> Having having attended the 1966 [[Venice Biennale]],<ref name="idharry">{{ro icon}} Iordan Datcu, [http://www.romlit.ro/amintirile_lui_harry_brauner "Amintirile lui Harry Brauner"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 25/2008</ref> he won the [[Israel Prize]] of 1967, in recognition of his work as painter.<ref name="aomiinedit"/><ref name="jancoimj"/><ref name="ezsurrjanko"/><ref name="lshianco"/><ref name="isrbonhams">[http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=2&int_new=46453 "Israeli Art & Judaica to Make First Appearance in Sale at Bonhams in London"], in ''[[ArtDaily]]''; retrieved September 8, 2011</ref>

In 1960, Janco's presence in Ein Hod was challenged by the returning Palestinians, who tried to reclaim the land. He organized a community defense force, headed by sculptor [[Tuvia Iuster]], which guarded Ein Hod until [[Israel Police]] intervened against the protesters.<ref>Slyomovics (2010), p.427</ref> Janco was generally tolerant of those Palestinians who set up the small rival community of [[Ein Hawd]]: he notably maintained contacts with tribal leader Abu Hilmi and with Arab landscape artist Muin Zaydan Abu al-Hayja, but the relationship between the two villages was generally distant.<ref>Slyomovics (1995), p.49-50</ref> Janco has also been described as "disinterested" in the fate of his Arab neighbors.<ref name="ezsurrjanko"/>

For a second time, Janco reunited with Costin when the latter fled [[Communist Romania]].

==Work==
===From Iser's Postimpressionism to Expressionist Dada===
The earliest works by Janco show the influence of [[Iosif Iser]], adopting the visual trappings of [[Postimpressionism]] and illustrating, for the first time in Janco's career, the interest in modern [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] techniques;<ref>Sandqvist, p.70, 72, 75, 86, 352</ref> Liana Saxone-Horodi believes that Iser's manner is most evident in Janco's 1911 work, ''Self-portrait with Hat'', preserved at the Janco-Dada Museum.<ref name="lshianco"/> Around 1913, Janco was in more direct contact with the French sources of Iser's Postimpressionism, having by then discovered on his own the work of [[Andr<U+00E9> Derain]].<ref name="ts78"/> However, his covers and vignettes for ''[[Simbolul]]'' are generally [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] to the point of pastiche. Researcher [[Tom Sandqvist]] presumes that Janco was in effect following his friends' command, as "his own preferences were soon closer to [[Paul C<U+00E9>zanne|C<U+00E9>zanne]] and [[Cubism|cubist]]-influenced modes of expression".<ref>Sandqvist, p.75</ref> 

Futurism was thrown into the mix, a fact acknowledged by Janco during his 1930 encounter with Marinetti: "we were nourished by [Futurist] ideas and empowered to be enthusiastic."<ref name="ts237"/> A third major source for Janco's imagery was [[Expressionism]], initially coming to him from both ''[[Die Br<U+00FC>cke]]'' artists and [[Oskar Kokoschka]],<ref name="vd&al257">Dr<U+0103>gu<U+0163> ''et al.'', p.257</ref> and later reactivated by his contacts at ''[[Der Sturm]]''.<ref name="dg389"/> Among his early canvasses, the self-portraits and the portraits of clowns have been discussed as particularly notable samples of Romanian Expressionism.<ref>Grigorescu, p.442-443; [[Amelia Pavel]], ''Expresionismul <U+015F>i premisele sale'', [[Editura Meridiane]], Bucharest, 1978, p.85.  {{OCLC|5484893}}</ref>

The influence of Germanic Postimpressionism on Janco's art was crystallized during his studies at the [[ETH Zurich|Federal Institute of Technology]]. His more important teachers there, Sandqvist observes, were sculptor [[Johann Jakob Graf]] and architect [[Karl Moser]]<U+2014>the latter in particular, for his ideas on the architectural ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]''. Sandqvist suggests that, after modernizing Moser's ideas, Janco first theorized that [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract-Expressionistic]] decorations needed to an integral part of the basic architectural design.<ref>Sandqvist, p.80-81, 342</ref> In paintings from Janco's ''Cabaret Voltaire'' period, the figurative element is not canceled, but usually subdued: the works show a mix of influences, primarily from Cubism or Futurism, and have been described by Janco's colleague Arp as "zigzag [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalism]]".<ref>Sandqvist, p.81, 84, 86-87, 337</ref> His series on dancers, painted before 1917 and housed by the [[Israel Museum]], moves between the atmospheric qualities of a Futurism filtered through Dada and Janco's first experiments in purely abstract art.<ref>Sandqvist, p.86-87</ref> 

His assimilation of Expressionism has led scholar [[John Willett]] to discuss Dadaism as visually an Expressionist sub-current,<ref>Grigorescu, p.243</ref> and, in retrospect, Janco himself claimed that Dada was not as much a fully-fledged new artistic style as "a force coming from the physical instincts", directed against "everything cheap".<ref>Sandqvist, p.87</ref> However, his own work also features the quintessentially Dada [[found art]], or everyday objects rearranged as art<U+2014>reportedly, he was the first Dadaist to experiment in such manner.<ref>Christa von Lengerke, "Contemporary Painting. New Movements in Painting since 1945", in Ingo F. Walther, Robert Suckale (eds.), ''Masterpieces of Western Art: A History of Art in 900 Individual Studies'', Vol. I, [[Taschen]], Cologne, 2002, p.617.  ISBN 3-8228-1825-9</ref> His other studies, in [[collage]] and [[relief]], have been described by reviewers as "a personal synthesis which is identifiable as his own to this day",<ref name="issothe">[http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&int_new=22622&int_modo=2 "Israeli & International Art Sale To Be Held at Sotheby's New York"], in ''[[ArtDaily]]''; retrieved September 8, 2011</ref> and ranked among "the most courageous and original experiments in abstract art."<ref name="traseuurban"/>

The ''[[Contimporanul]]'' years were a period of artistic exploration. Although a Constructivist architect and designer, Janco was still identifiable as an Expressionist in his ink-drawn portraits of writers and in some of his canvasses. According to scholar [[Dan Grigorescu]], his essays of the time fluctuate away from Constructivism, and adopt ideas common in Expressionism, [[Surrealism]], or even the [[Byzantine revival]] suggested by anti-modernist reviews.<ref>Grigorescu, p.393</ref> His ''Rolling the Dice'' piece is a meditation on the tragedy of human existence, which reinterprets the symbolism of [[zodiac]]s<ref>Dr<U+0103>gu<U+0163> ''et al.'', p.257-258</ref> and probably alludes to the seedier side of urban life.<ref>{{ro icon}} Raluca B<U+0103>loiu, [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/orasul-pictat-arta-citadina-romaneasca-1918-1947-4838805 "Arta citadin<U+0103> rom<U+00E2>neasc<U+0103>. 1918-1947"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', September 2, 2009</ref> The Expressionist transfiguration of shapes was especially noted in his drawings of [[Mateiu Caragiale]] and [[Stephan Roll]], created from harsh and seemingly spontaneous lines.<ref name="vd&al257"/> The style was ridiculed at the time by traditionalist poet [[George Top<U+00EE>rceanu]], who wrote that, in ''Antologia poe<U+0163>ilor de azi'', [[Ion Barbu]] looked "a [[Mongols|Mongolian]] bandit", [[Felix Aderca]] "a shoemaker's apprentice", and [[Alice C<U+0103>lug<U+0103>ru]] "an alcoholic fishwife".<ref name="gt360-361"/> Such views were contrasted by [[Perpessicius]]' publicized belief that Janco was "the purest artist", his drawings evidencing the "great vital force" of his subjects.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.313-314</ref> Top<U+00EE>rceanu's claim is contradicted by literary historian [[Barbu Cioculescu]], who finds the ''Antologia'' drawings: "exquisitely synthetic<U+2014>some of them masterpieces; take it from someone who has seen from up close many of the writers portrayed".<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Barbu Cioculescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/firul_vremii_n_concertul_vocilor "Firul vremii <U+00EE>n concertul vocilor"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 6/2001</ref>

===Primitive and collective art===
As a Dada, Janco was interested in the raw and primitive art, generated by "the instinctive power of creation", and he credited [[Paul Klee]] with having helped him "interpret the soul of primitive man".<ref name="kl96"/><ref>Federica Pirani, ''Klee'', [[Giunti Editore]], Florence, 2008, p.26.  ISBN 88-09-76129-4</ref> A distinct application of Dada was his own work with masks, seen by [[Hugo Ball]] as having generated fascination with their unusual "kinetic power", and useful for performing "larger-than-life characters and passions."<ref>Harris Smith, p.44</ref> However, Janco's understanding of [[African traditional masks|African masks]], [[African sculpture|idols]] and [[Traditional African religion|ritual]] was, according to art historians [[Mark Antliff]] and [[Patricia Leighten]], "deeply romanticized" and "[[Reductionism|reductive]]".<ref>[[Mark Antliff]], [[Patricia Leighten]], "Primitive", in Robert S. Nelson, [[Richard A. Shiff]], ''Critical Terms for Art History'', [[University of Chicago Press]], Chicago & London, 2003, p.228-229.  ISBN 0-226-57168-8</ref>

At the end of the Dada episode, Janco also took his growing interest in [[primitivism]] to the level of academia: in his 1918 speech at the Zurich Institute, he declared that [[African art|African]], [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]], [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] arts were more genuine and "spiritual" than the Renaissance and its derivatives, while also issuing special praise for the modern spirituality of Derain, [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]; his lecture rated all Cubists above all [[Impressionism|Impressionists]].<ref>Sandqvist, p.81</ref> In his contribution to ''[[Das Neue Leben]]'' theory, he spoke about a return to the [[handicraft]]s, ending the "divorce" between art and life.<ref name="ss(95)44-45">Slyomovics (1995), p.44-45</ref> Art critic Harry Seiwert also notes that Janco's art also reflected his contact with various other alternative models, found in [[Art of ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptian]] and [[History of Eastern art|Far Eastern art]], in the paintings of [[Cimabue]] and [[El Greco]], and in [[Cloisonnism]].<ref>Sandqvist, p.254-255</ref> Seiwert and Sandqvist both propose that Janco's work had other enduring connections with the visual conventions of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hassidism]] and the dark tones often favored by 20th-century [[Jewish art]].<ref>Sandqvist, p.305-306, 343</ref>

Around 1919, Janco had come to describe Constructivism as a needed transition from "negative" Dada, an idea also pioneered by his colleagues [[Kurt Schwitters]] and [[Theo van Doesburg]], and finding an early expression in Janco's plaster relief ''Soleil jardin clair'' (1918).<ref>Prat, p.51, 99, 104</ref> In part, Janco's post-Dadaism responded to the socialist ideals of Constructivism. According to Sandqvist, his affiliation to ''Das Neue Leben'' and his sporadic contacts with the [[Arbeitsrat f<U+00FC>r Kunst|Art Soviet]] of [[Munich]] meant that he was trying to "adjust to the spirit of the age."<ref>Sandqvist, p.96</ref> Historian Hubert F. van der Berg also notes that the socialist ideal of "a new life", implicitly adopted by Janco, was a natural peacetime development of Dada's discourse about "the new man".<ref>Van der Berg, p.146</ref>

The activity at ''Contimporanul'' cemented Janco's belief in primitivism and the values of [[outsider art]]. In a 1924 piece, he argued: "The [[Child art|art of children]], folk art, the art of psychopaths, of primitive people are the liveliest ones, the most expressive ones, coming to us from organic depths, without cultivated beauty."<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.161; Grigorescu, p.393</ref> He ridiculed, like Ion Vinea before him, the substance of Romania's academic traditionalism, notably in a provocative drawing which showed a grazing donkey under the title "Tradition".<ref>Crohm<U+0103>lniceanu, p.60</ref> Instead, Janco was publicizing the idea that Dada and various other strands of modernism were the actual tradition, for being indirectly indebted to the [[Absurdism|absurdist]] nature of [[Romanian folklore]].<ref>Pop, "Un 'misionar al artei noi' (II)", p.11; Sandqvist, p.248</ref> The matter of Janco's own debt to his country's peasant art is more controversial. In the 1920s, Vinea discussed Janco's Cubism is a direct echo of an old abstract art that is supposedly native and exclusive to Romania<U+2014>an assumption considered exaggerated by [[Paul Cernat]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.129, 141, 171-172, 198-200, 210, 212, 407-409</ref> Seiwert suggests that virtually none of Janco's paintings show a verifiable contact with Romanian primitivism, but his opinion is questioned by Sandqvist: he writes that Janco's masks and prints are homages to traditional Romanian decorative patterns.<ref>Sandqvist, p.254-255, 259, 261</ref>

===Beyond Constructivism===
For a while, Janco rediscovered himself in abstract and semi-abstract art, describing the basic geometrical shapes as pure forms, and art as the effort to organize these forms<U+2014>ideas akin with the "picto-poetry" of Romanian avant-garde writers such as [[Ilarie Voronca]].<ref name="ip(2)10-11">Pop, "Un 'misionar al artei noi' (II)", p.10-11</ref> After 1930, when Constructivism lost its position of leadership on Romania's artistic scene,<ref name="mvipostaze"/><ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.171-172, 177-179; Pop, "Un 'misionar al artei noi' (II)", p.11</ref> Janco made a return to "analytic" Cubism, echoing the early work of Picasso in his painting ''Peasant Woman and Eggs''.<ref name="vd&al257"/> This period centered on various semi-figurative cityscapes, which, according to scholar [[Sorin Alexandrescu]], stand out for their objectification of the human figure.<ref name="czregindirea">{{ro icon}} Cezar Gheorghe, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Regindirea-orasului*articleID_24420-articles_details.html "Reg<U+00EE>ndirea ora<U+015F>ului"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 547, October 2010</ref> Also then, Janco worked on seascape and still life canvasses, in brown tones and Cubist arrangements.<ref name="lshianco"/> Diversification touched his other activities. His theory of set design still mixed Expressionism into Futurism and Constructivism, calling for an actor-based Expressionist theater and a mechanized, movement-based, cinema.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.166-167</ref> However, his parallel work in [[costume design]] evidenced a toning down of avant-garde tendencies (to the displeasure of his colleagues at ''Integral'' magazine), and a growing preoccupation with ''[[commedia dell'arte]]''.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.159</ref>

In discussing architecture, Janco described himself and the other ''Artistes Radicaux'' as the mentors of Europe's modernist urban planners, including [[Bruno Taut]] and the ''[[Bauhaus]]'' group.<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.160-161</ref> The ideals of [[collectivism]] in art, "art as life", and a "Constructivist revolution" dominated his programmatic texts of the mid 1920s, which offered as examples the activism of ''[[De Stijl]]'', ''[[Blok (magazine)|Blok]]'' and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Constructivist architecture]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.163-164, 254, 255, 258-259, 260</ref> His own architectural work was entirely dedicated to functionalism: in his words, the purpose of architecture was a "harmony of forms", with designs as simplified as to resemble crystals.<ref>Sandqvist, p.342</ref> His experiment on Trinit<U+0103><U+0163>ii Street, with its angular pattern and multicolored facade, has been rated one of the most spectacular samples of Romanian modernism,<ref name="traseuurban"/> while the buildings he designed later came with [[Art Deco]] elements, including the "[[ocean liner]]"-type balconies.<ref name="jpmodernist"/> At the other end, his [[Predeal]] sanatorium was described by Sandqvist as "a long, narrow white building clearly signaling its function as a hospital" and "smoothly adapting to the landscape."<ref name="ts341-342"/> Functionalism was further illustrated by Janco's ideas on furniture design, where he favored "small heights", "simple aesthetics", as well as "a maximum of comfort"<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.168-169</ref> which would "pay no tribute to richness".<ref name="traseuurban"/>

Scholars have also noted that "the breath of [[humanitarianism]]" unites the work of Janco, Maxy and [[Corneliu Mich<U+0103>ilescu]], beyond their shared eclecticism.<ref>Dr<U+0103>gu<U+0163> ''et al.'', p.254-255</ref> Cernat nevertheless suggests that the ''Contimporanul'' group was politically disengaged and making efforts to separate art from politics, giving positive coverage to both [[Marxism]] and [[Italian fascism]].<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.229-239</ref> In that context, a more evidently Marxist form of Constructivism, close to [[Proletkult]], was being taken up independently by Maxy.<ref name="mvipostaze"/> Janco's functionalist goal was still coupled with socialist imagery, as in ''C<U+0103>tre o arhitectur<U+0103> a Bucure<U+015F>tilor'', called an architectural ''[[tikkun olam]]'' by Sandqvist.<ref name="ts343"/> Indebted to [[Le Corbusier]]'s ''[[Toward an Architecture|New Architecture]]'',<ref>{{ro icon}} Daria Ghiu [http://www.revista22.ro/bucurestiul-cultural-nr-96-bienala-bucure351tiului-despre-produc355ia--8737.html "Bienala Bucure<U+015F>tiului. Despre produc<U+0163>ia posibilit<U+0103><U+0163>ilor"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 1067, August 2010</ref> Janco theorized that Bucharest had the "luck" of not yet being systematized or built-up, and that it could be easily turned into a [[Garden city movement|garden city]], without ever repeating the West's "chain of mistakes".<ref name="traseuurban"/> According to architecture historians Mihaela Criticos and [[Ana Maria Zahariade]], Janco's creed was not in fact radically different from mainstream Romanian opinions: "although declaring themselves committed to the modernist agenda, [Janco and others] nuance it with their own formulas, away from the abstract utopias of the [[International style (architecture)|International Style]]."<ref>{{ro icon}} Mihaela Criticos, [[Ana Maria Zahariade]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/cultura-urbana/articol/modelul-francez-in-arhitectura-romaneasca "Modelul francez <U+00EE>n arhitectura rom<U+00E2>neasc<U+0103>. Perioada modern<U+0103> (1830-1945)"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 157, February 2007</ref> A similar point is made by Sorin Alexandrescu, who attested a "general contradiction" in Janco's architecture, that between Janco's own wishes and those of his patrons.<ref name="czregindirea"/>

===Holocaust art and Israeli abstractionism===
Soon after his first visit to Palestine and his Zionist conversion, Janco began painting landscapes in optimistic tones, including a general view over [[Tiberias]]<ref name="lshianco"/> and bucolic [[watercolor]]s.<ref name="isrbonhams"/> By the time of World War II, however, he was again an Expressionist, fascinated with the major existential themes. The war experience inspired his 1945 painting ''Fascist Genocide'', which is also seen by Grigorescu as one of his contributions to Expressionism.<ref>Grigorescu, p.453</ref> Janco's sketches of the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Bucharest Pogrom]] are, according to cultural historian [[David G. Roskies]], "extraordinary" and in complete break with Janco's "earlier surrealistic style"; he paraphrases the rationale for this change as: "Why bother with surrealism when the world itself has gone crazy?"<ref name="dgr289"/> According to the painter's own definition: "I was drawing with the thirst of one who is being chased around, desperate to quench it and find his refuge."<ref name="vsconfes"/> As he recalled, these works were not well received in the post-war [[Zionism|Zionist]] community, because they evoked painful memories in a general mood of optimism; as a result, Janco decided to change his palette and tackle subjects which related exclusively to his new country.<ref>Manor, p.259, 261</ref> An exception to this self-imposed rule was the motif of "wounded soldiers", which continued to preoccupy him after 1948, and was also thematically linked to the wartime massacres.<ref>Manor, p.275</ref>

During and after his ''[[Ofakim Hadashim]]'' engagement, Marcel Janco again moved into the realm of pure abstraction, which he believed represented the artistic "language" of a new age.<ref>Manor, p.261</ref> This was an older idea, as first illustrated by his 1925 attempt to create an "alphabet of shapes", the basis for any abstractionist composition.<ref name="mvipostaze"/> His subsequent preoccupations were linked to the Jewish tradition of interpreting symbols, and he reportedly told scholar [[Moshe Idel]]: "I paint in ''[[Kabbalah]]''".<ref>{{ro icon}} Marius Vasileanu, [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/literatura-romana-si-cercetarile-esoterice-de-marius-vasileanu-7772736 "Literatura rom<U+00E2>n<U+0103> <U+015F>i cercet<U+0103>rile esoterice"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', December 2, 2010</ref> He was still eclectic beyond abstractionism, and made frequent returns to brightly colored, semi-figurative, landscapes.<ref name="lshianco"/> Also eclectic is Janco's sparse contribution to the [[architecture of Israel]], including a [[Herzliya Pituah]] villa that is entirely built in the non-modernist ''[[Poble Espanyol]]'' style.<ref name="ezsurrjanko"/> Another component of Janco's work was his revisiting of earlier Dada experiments: he redid some of his Dada masks,<ref name="lshianco"/> and supported the international avant-garde group ''[[NO!art]]''.<ref>Rainer Rumold, " 'No!art' Negative Aesthetics as Resistance to the Art of Forgetting", in Robert Fletcher (ed.), ''Beyond Resistance: The Future of Freedom'', [[Nova Publishers]], Hauppauge, 2007, p.23.  ISBN 1-60021-032-5</ref> He later worked on the ''Imaginary Animals'' cycle of paintings, inspired by the short stories of [[Urmuz]].<ref name="lshianco"/><ref name="ip(2)10-11"/> 

Meanwhile, his Ein Hod project was in various ways the culmination of his promotion of folk art, and, in Janco's own definition, "my last Dada activity".<ref name="ss(95)44-45"/> According to some interpretations, he may have been directly following the example of Hans Arp's "Waggis" commune, which existed in 1920s Switzerland.<ref name="pc130"/><ref name="gspopas"/> Anthropologist Susan Slyomovics argues that the Ein Hod project as a whole was an alternative to the standard practice of Zionist colonization, since, instead of creating new buildings in the ancient scenery, it showed attempts to cultivate the existing Arab-style masonry.<ref>Slyomovics (1995), p.45-47</ref> She also writes that Janco's landscapes of the place "romanticize" his own contact with the Palestinians, and that they fail to clarify whether he thought of Arabs as refugees or as fellow inhabitants.<ref>Slyomovics (1995), p.47</ref> Journalist Esther Zanberg describes Janco as an "[[Orientalism|Orientalist]]" driven by "the mythology surrounding Israeli nationalistic Zionism."<ref name="ezsurrjanko"/> Art historian Nissim Gal also concludes: "the pastoral vision of Janco [does not] include any trace of the inhabitants of the former Arab village".<ref name="ngartinisr"/>

Admired by his contemporaries on the avant-garde scene, Marcel Janco is mentioned or portrayed in several works by Romanian authors. In the 1910s, Vinea dedicated him the poem "Tuzla", which is one of his first contributions to modernist literature;<ref>Sandqvist, p.136</ref> a decade later, one of the Janco exhibits inspired him to write the [[prose poem]] ''Dan<U+0163>ul pe fr<U+00E2>nghie'' ("Dancing on a Wire").<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.198</ref> Following his conflict with the painter, Tzara struck out all similar dedications from his own poems.<ref name="pc130"/> Before their friendship waned, [[Ion Barbu]] also contributed a homage to Janco, referring to his Constructivist paintings as "storms of [[protractor]]s".<ref name="gsberlin"/> In addition, Janco was dedicated a poem by [[Belgium|Belgian]] artist [[<U+00C9>mile Malespine]], and is mentioned in one of Marinetti's poetic texts about the 1930 visit to Romania,<ref>Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.176, 267</ref> as well as in the verse of [[neo-Dada]]ist [[Valery Oisteanu]].<ref>{{ro icon}} Ovidiu Dr<U+0103>ghia, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/ON-LINE.-Revista-presei*articleID_8094-articles_details.html "Revista presei"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 165-166, April 2003</ref> Janco's portrait was painted by colleague [[Victor Brauner]], in 1924.<ref name="gsberlin"/>

According to Sandqvist, there are three competing aspects in Janco's legacy, which relate to the complexity of his profile: "In Western cultural history Marcel Janco is best known as one of the founding members of Dada in Zurich in 1916. Regarding the Romanian avant-garde in the interwar period Marcel Hermann Iancu is more known as the spider in the web and as the designer of a great number of Romania's first constructivist buildings [...]. On the other hand, in Israel Marcel Janco is best known as the 'father' of the artists' colony of Ein Hod [...] and for his pedagogic achievements in the young Jewish state."<ref>Sandqvist, p.66</ref> Janco's memory is principally maintained by his Ein Hod museum. The building was damaged by the [[Mount Carmel forest fire (2010)|2010 forest fire]], but reopened and grew to include a permanent exhibit of Janco's art.<ref name="lshianco"/> Janco's paintings still have a measurable impact on the contemporary Israeli avant-garde, which is largely divided between the abstractionism he helped introduce and the [[Neorealism (art)|neorealistic]] disciples of [[Michail Grobman]] and [[Avraham Ofek]].<ref>Alice Pfeiffer, [http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-opinion/the-market/2010-05-18/pierre-berge-art-israel/ "A New Promised Art" (interview with Fabien B<U+00E9>jean-Lebenson)], in ''[[Art in America]]'', May 18, 2010</ref>

The [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]], which cracked down on modernism, reconfirmed the confiscation of villas built by the ''Birou de Studii Moderne'', which it then leased to other families.<ref name="traseuurban"/><ref name="apaparareami"/> One of these lodgings, the Wexler Villa, was assigned as the residence of communist poet [[Eugen Jebeleanu]].<ref name="apaparareami"/><ref>{{ro icon}} [[Vladimir Tism<U+0103>neanu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/via355a-351i-timpurile-lui-eugen-jebeleanu-10576.html "Via<U+0163>a <U+015F>i timpurile lui Eugen Jebeleanu"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 1106, May 2011</ref> The regime tended to ignore Janco's contributions, which were not listed in the architectural who's who,<ref name="vamareaarh">{{ro icon}} Victoria Anghelescu, [http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/Marea-arhitectura-ruine-termopane_0_26397375.html "Marea arhitectur<U+0103>, <U+00EE>ntre ruine <U+015F>i termopane"], in ''[[Adev<U+0103>rul Literar <U+015F>i Artistic]]'', November 5, 2008</ref> and it became standard practice to generally omit references to his Jewish ethnicity.<ref name="vsconfes"/> He was however honored with a special issue of ''[[Secolul 20]]'' literary magazine, in 1979,<ref name="gspopas"/> and interviewed for ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'' and ''[[Luceaf<U+0103>rul (magazine)|Luceaf<U+0103>rul]]'' journals (1981, 1984).<ref>Pop, "Un 'misionar al artei noi' (II)", p.11</ref> His architectural legacy was affected by the [[Ceau<U+015F>ima|large-scale demolition program]] of the 1980s.

After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], Marcel Janco's buildings were subject to legal battles, as the original owners and their descendants were allowed to contest the nationalization.<ref name="traseuurban"/> These landmarks, like other modernist assets, became treasured real estate: in 1996, a Janco house was valued at 500,000 [[United States dollar]]s.<ref name="jpmodernist"/> The sale of such property happened at a fast pace, reportedly surpassing the standardized conservation effort, and experts noted with alarm that Janco villas were being defaced with anachronistic additions, such as [[insulated glazing]]<ref name="vamareaarh"/><ref>{{ro icon}} Lumini<U+0163>a Batali, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Pariul-unei-administratii-europene*articleID_17354-articles_details.html "Pariul unei administra<U+0163>ii europene"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 366-367, April 2007</ref> and structural interventions,<ref name="apaparareami"/> or eclipsed by the newer highrise.<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Geo <U+015E>erban]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Samsarii-imobiliari-mostenitorii-dictatorului*articleID_22234-articles_details.html "Samsarii imobiliari, mo<U+015F>tenitorii dictatorului"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 487, August 2009</ref> In 2008, despite calls from within the academic community, only three of his buildings had been inscribed in the [[National Register of Historic Monuments in Romania|National Register of Historic Monuments]].<ref name="vamareaarh"/>

Janco was again being referenced as a possible model for new generations of Romanian architects and urban planners. In a 2011 article, poet and architect August Ioan claimed: "Romanian architecture is, apart from its few years with Marcel Janco, one that has denied itself experimentation, projective thinking, anticipation. [...] it is content with imports, copies, nuances or pure and simple stagnation."<ref>{{ro icon}} Augustin Ioan, [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/70_via-a-romaneasca-1-2-2011/55_civica/783_experiment-in-arhitectura-romaneasca-doua-propuneri.html "Experiment <U+00EE>n arhitectura rom<U+00E2>neasc<U+0103>"], in ''[[Via<U+0163>a Rom<U+00E2>neasc<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 1-2/2011</ref> This stance is contrasted by that of designer Radu Com<U+015F>a, who argues that praise for the artist often lacks "the recoil of objectivity".<ref name="rcjdavid"/> Janco's programmatic texts on the issue were collected and reviewed by historian [[Andrei Pippidi]] in the 2003 retrospective anthology ''Bucure<U+015F>ti <U+2013> Istorie <U+015F>i urbanism'' ("Bucharest.
