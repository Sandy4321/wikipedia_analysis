'''Mljet''' ({{IPA-sh|m<U+028E><U+025B><U+0302>t|pron}}; {{lang-la|Melita}}, {{lang-it|Meleda}}) is the most southerly and easterly of the larger [[Adriatic]] [[island]]s of the [[Dalmatia]] region of [[Croatia]]. The National Park includes the western part of the island, Veliko jezero, Malo jezero, Soline Bay and a sea belt 500 m wide from the most prominent cape of Mljet covering an area of 54&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The central parts of the park are Veliko jezero with the Isle of St. Mary, Malo jezero and the villages of [[Govedari]] (179 inhabitants), [[Pola<U+010D>e]] (123 inhabitants) and [[Pomena]] (50 inhabitants).<ref name ="Naprijet">Naklad Naprijet, ''The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide'', pg. 338, Zagreb (1999), ISBN 953-178-097-8</ref>

== Population ==

According to the 2001 census, Mljet has population of 1,111. [[Croats]] make up an absolute majority with 97.93% of the population.

== History ==

Mljet was discovered by ancient [[Greco-Roman geographers]], who wrote the first records and descriptions.  The island was first described by [[Scylax of Caryanda]] in the 6th century BC; others prefer the text, [[Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax]]. In both texts, it is named Melite and supported by [[Apollonius of Rhodes]].<ref Name="Sanader">Sanader, Mirjana.

Mljet is mentioned around 950 by the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos]] in his ''Of Ruling an Empire'' as one of the islands held by the [[Neretvians]]. The island was often a controversy of ownership between [[Pagania]] and [[Zachlumia]] until the stronger unifications of the Serbian realm in the 12th century.

Mljet has been regarded as the "Melita" on which [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] was shipwrecked ([[Acts of the Apostles]] 27:39-28:11), this view being first expounded in the 10th century, by Eastern Roman Emperor [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]]. Saint Paul's shipwreck is generally placed on the [[Mediterranean]] island of [[Malta]].  Mljet and Malta had the same name in the Greek and Roman sources; the mention of a viper in Acts 28:3-5 was thought to be in favour of Mljet (but there are snakes on both Mljet and [[Malta]]). A harbour named after the Saint exists on both islands.

The [[Benedictine]]s from Pulsano in [[Apulia]] became the feudal lords of the island in 1151, having come from [[Monte Gargano]] in [[Italy]]. They came ashore in the Sutmiholjska cove and Serbian Prince Desa of the [[House of Vojislavljevi<U+0107>]] built and donated to them the [[Church (building)|Church]] and [[Monastery]] of [[Saint Mary]] on the islet in the Big Lake (1187<U+2013>1198). [[Pope Innocent III]] issued a document consecrating the church in 1198.

The island was under the rule of [[Stefan Nemanja]] in 1166-1168. In 1222, the [[List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King]] [[Stefan Prvoven<U+010D>ani|Stefan II the First-crowned]] of [[Nemanji<U+0107>|Nemanja]] gifted his lands and monasteries and church on [[Kor<U+010D>ula|Krkar]] to the Benedictine Order of Mljet. After serving as the last Serbian maritime bastion, [[Serbian Empire|Serbian Emperor]] [[Stefan Uro<U+0161> V]] gifted the island to [[Bal<U+0161>a I]] in 1357.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The Benedictines renounced their rule over the island in 1345, keeping only a third of the land. The island got a statute and a municipality in [[Babino Polje]]. It was formally annexed by the [[Republic of Ragusa]] in 1410. According to the Contract with the Benedictines, the municipality had to pay 300 perpers each year.
[[File:Mljet pomena.JPG|thumb|right|270px|Seaside of Pomena]]

In the 16th century, the monastery was the center of the [[Mljet Congregation]] (Congregatio Melitensis or Melitana), gathering all the monasteries of Benedictine monks in the area of the Republic of Ragusa. The first president of the Congregation was [[Mavro Vetranovi<U+0107>]], the abbot of the Mljet monastery and the famous poet. Another great poet was abbot there - [[Ignjat <U+0110>ur<U+0111>evi<U+0107>]] in the 18th century. As time went by, the Benedictine monastery on Mljet lost its importance, while the seat of the Mljet Congregation moved to Sveti Jakov near [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]].

In 1809, during the rule of [[Napoleon]], the Mljet monastery was disbanded. When [[Austria]] took over the island, it placed the forestry office in the building. Between the world wars, the building was owned by the Ragusa (Dubrovnik) Bishopric. In 1960 it became a hotel, and in 1998 it was returned to the bishopric.

The island has a long history of eco-damage. In order to ease their transport problems, the monks dug a channel to the south coast, from the lake, thus turning both fresh-water lakes into seawater-based ones.

The second incident involves [[mongoose]]s. These were introduced onto the island in the [[Middle Ages]] in order to reduce the [[snake]] population (the island was apparently completely overrun). Whilst the mongooses completed this task, they also disposed of pretty much all the birdlife of the island, especially eggs. To this day, the island is notably short of hedgerow [[bird]]s such as [[sparrow]]s.

==Geography==
[[File:Mljet Coastline.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Mljet Coastline]]

Mljet lies south of the [[Pelje<U+0161>ac]] peninsula, from which it is divided by the Mljet Channel. Its length is {{convert|37|km|mi}}; its average breadth {{convert|3.2|km|mi}}. It is of volcanic origin,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} with numerous chasms and gorges, of which the longest, the Babino Polje, connects the north and south of the island. Port Pola<U+010D>e, the principal harbour in the north, is a port of call for tourist ferries. Mljet contains one hotel - The Odisej (from the Greek Odysseus) in the north-west corner of the island.

The northwestern part of the island includes an inland sea as well as a small island within it. It has been a [[national park]] since November 12, 1960.

[[Ancient Greeks]] called the island "Melita" or "[[honey]]" which over the centuries evolved to become the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] name, Mljet ({{IPA-sh|m<U+028E><U+025B>t|pron}}).

Over 84% of the island of {{convert|98.01|km2|sqmi}} is forest.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.undp.hr/upload/file/227/113690/FILENAME/31_07_Kartiranje_stanista_Dal...u_prioritetnim_podrucjima_S_.pdf | title=Priru<U+010D>nik o kartama stani<U+0161>ta Dalmacije | month=June | year=2009 | format=PDF | language=Croatian and English | page=103 | accessdate=14 February 2011}}</ref> The island's geological structure consists of [[limestone]] and [[dolomite]] forming ridges, crests and slopes. A few depressions on the island of Mljet are below sea level and are known as ''blatine'' ("mud-lakes") or ''slatine'' ("salt-lakes"). During the rain seasons all blatine are filled with water and turn to brackish during dry seasons.

The climate is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]]; an average air temperature in January is 9&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (48&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) and in July about 24&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (75&nbsp;<U+00B0>F).
