The '''Jewel Tower''' is a 14th-century surviving element of the royal [[Palace of Westminster]], in London, England. It was built between 1365 and 1366, under the direction of William of Sleaford and [[Henry de Yevele]], to house the personal treasure of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. The tower, a three-storey, [[crenellations|crenellated]] stone building, occupied a secluded part of the palace and was protected by a [[moat]] linked to the [[River Thames]]. The ground floor featured elaborate carved [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]], described by historian Jeremy Ashbee as "an architectural masterpiece". The tower continued to be used for storing the monarch's treasure and personal possessions until 1512, when a fire in the palace caused [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] to relocate his court to [[Whitehall]]. 

At the end of the 16th century, the [[House of Lords]] began to use the tower to store its parliamentary records, building a house alongside it for the use of the parliamentary clerk, and extensive improvements followed in 1621. The tower continued as the Lords' records office through the 18th century, and several sets of renovations and building work were carried out to improve its [[Fireproofing|fire-proofing]] and comfort, creating the current appearance of the tower. In 1834, the tower was one of only four buildings to survive a [[Burning of Parliament|terrible fire in Westminster]], and in the aftermath the records were moved to a [[Victoria Tower|new, purpose built archive]]. 

The Jewel Tower was taken over by the newly formed [[Standard Weights and Measures Department]] in 1869, who used it for storing and testing official weights and measures. The rising levels of London traffic made the tower increasingly unsuitable for this work, and by 1938 the department had abandoned it in favour of other facilities. In 1948, the building was placed into the care of the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]], who repaired the damage inflicted to the tower during the [[Second World War]], and extensively restored the building, clearing the surrounding area and opening the tower for tourists. In the 21st century, the Jewel Tower is managed by [[English Heritage]], receiving around 30,000 visitors each year.

===14th - 16th centuries===
====Purpose====
[[File:Vaulted ceiling of the Jewel Tower.jpg|thumb|The [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] ceiling on the ground floor]]
The Jewel Tower was built within the [[Palace of Westminster]] between 1365 and 1366, on the instructions of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], to hold his personal treasure.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=6}}</ref> Edward had broadly three types of treasure: his ceremonial [[regalia]], which was usually kept at the [[Tower of London]] or held by the [[Abbot of Westminster]]; the jewellery and [[Household silver|plate]] belonging to the [[The Crown|Crown]], which was kept by the Royal Treasurer at [[Westminster Abbey]]; and his personal collection of jewels and plate.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|pp=9-10}}</ref> English monarchs during this period used their personal jewels and plate as a substitute for cash, drawing on them to fund their military campaigns, or giving them as symbolic political gifts.<ref>{{harvnb|Stratford|2012|p=3}}</ref> Edward accumulated what historian Jenny Stratford has described as a "vast store of jewels and plate", and his collection of personal treasure was at its greatest during the 1360s.<ref>{{harvnb|Stratford|2012|p=42}}</ref>

Edward had managed this last category of personal treasure through an organisation called the [[Wardrobe (government)|Privy Wardrobe]].<ref name=Taylor1991P10>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=10}}</ref> The [[Keeper of the wardrobe|Keeper of the Privy Wardrobe]] was responsible for guarding and recording the king's belongings, and dispatching particular items around the kingdom, potentially giving them as gifts to the monarch's family and friends.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|pp=10-11}}</ref> The Privy Wardrobe was initially based in the Tower of London in Edward's reign and became focused on handling the supplies for his campaigns in France.<ref name=Taylor1991P10/> This probably encouraged the King to decide to build a new tower in Westminster to host a separate branch of the Privy Wardrobe specifically to manage his personal jewels and plate.<ref name=Taylor1991P10/> In practice, this branch also managed the clothes, [[vestments]] and similar goods belonging to the royal household - effectively, the non-military parts of the King's property.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=12}}; {{cite web| url = https://museuminsider.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Appendix-1.-The-Jewel-Tower-interpretation-plan.pdf| last1= Batty| first1 = Lorna| last2 = Ashbee| first2 = Jeremy| last3 = Kemkeran-Smith| first3 = Annie| last4 = Lambarth| first4 = Sarah| last5 = Gomez| first5 = Natalie | last6 = Sydney| first6 = Alex | last7 = Allen | first7 = Kath| last8 = Davies | first8 = Nicole | year = 2012-13 | title = Jewel Tower - Final Interpretation Plan  | publisher = English Heritage | | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=13 September 2014 |page =5}}</ref>

====Construction====
[[File:Foundations of the Jewel Tower.jpg|thumb|Part of the original wooden foundations of the tower, showing the [[oak]] sleeper and [[elm]] [[Deep foundation|piles]]]]
William of Sleaford was put in charge of the tower project as a whole; he was the clerk and surveyor of the King's works within the Palace of Westminster and the Tower of London, and became the Keeper of the Westminster Privy Wardrobe.<ref name=Taylor1991P10/> The Jewel Tower was designed and built by [[Henry de Yevele]], a prominent royal architect, supported by a team of masons he commissioned for both this project and a neighbouring piece of work to build a new clock tower nearby.<ref name=Taylor1991P7/> Hugh Herland was taken on as the chief carpenter for both projects .<ref name=Taylor1991P7>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=7}}</ref> The payments for the project were recorded on a {{convert|8|ft|6|in|adj=on}} long [[parchment]] roll, which is now held in the [[Public Record Office]].<ref name=Taylor1991P6>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=6}}</ref>

Stone was brought in for the two towers: 98 boat-loads of rough stone and {{convert|13782|ft}} of dressed stone from [[Maidstone]]; 469 cart-loads from [[Reigate]]; {{convert|26|long ton}} from [[Devon]] and {{convert|16|long ton}} from [[Normandy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|pp=7, 9}}</ref> Timber was brought from [[Surrey]], red floor tiles from [[Flanders]] and {{convert|97|sqft}} of glass purchased for the Jewel Tower alone.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=9}}; {{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=7}}</ref> A contractor was employed to fix iron grilles to the windows, and 18 locks were purchased to secure the various doors.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=9}}; {{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=9}}</ref> A main workforce of 19 stonemasons, up to 10 carpenters and other specialised tradesmen worked on the site, and in July 1366, a team of 23 labourers dug out the new [[moat]] over the course of a month.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=9}}; {{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|pp=15, 25}}</ref> 

The tower was constructed in the secluded north-west corner of the Palace of Westminster, overlooking the King's garden in the Privy Palace, the most private part of Westminster.<ref>{{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|pp=3, 21}}</ref> The tower was positioned so as not to encroach on the existing palace, but this meant it was built on top of land owned by the neighbouring Westminster Abbey.<ref name=Taylor1991P6/> It took six years for the Abbey to convince the King to agree to compensate for them for this annexation.<ref name=Taylor1991P6/> William Usshborne, one of Edward's officials, was blamed for this and, when he later choked to death while eating a fish from a pond in the palace, the monks argued that this was divine justice for his role in the affair.<ref>{{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=16}}</ref>

The tower was linked to the external walls of the palace, and further secured by its moat, which was connected to the [[River Thames]] by a {{convert|45|m}} channel.<ref>{{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=24}}</ref> The top of its walls were crenelated, and in order to prevent potential intruders there were no windows on the outside of the tower at the ground floor level.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=28}}; {{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=14}}</ref> The keeper would have worked from the first floor, and Edward's treasure itself was kept on the second floor, in locked chests.<ref>{{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|pp=8, 10}}</ref>

====Later medieval use====
[[File:Carving at Jewel Tower.jpg|thumb|A [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] from the ground floor ceiling, comprising four conjoined, grotesque heads]]
The Jewel Tower continued to be used by Edward's successors for storing treasure and personal possessions, until 1512, when a fire in Westminster Palace forced the royal court to relocate to [[Whitehall]], along with the jewels and plate from the tower.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=12}}</ref> The king, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], did not return to Westminster and instead built a new palace at Whitehall, but he continued to use the tower, then called the "Tholde Juelhous" ("the old Jewel House") for storing his wider household effects, including expensive cloths, linens, royal chess sets and walking sticks, but these appear to have been removed from the tower after his death.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|pp=12-13}}; {{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|pp=27-28}}</ref>

The Jewel Tower diminished in importance; probably during the 16th century, the palace walls on either side of the building were demolished, and part of the moat was filled in during 1551.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=13}}; {{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=15}}</ref> By the 1590s, the tower had begun to be used both for the storage of the Lords' records and as a house for the parliamentary clerk.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2012|p=36}}; {{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=13}}; {{cite web| url = https://museuminsider.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Appendix-1.-The-Jewel-Tower-interpretation-plan.pdf| last1= Batty| first1 = Lorna| last2 = Ashbee| first2 = Jeremy| last3 = Kemkeran-Smith| first3 = Annie| last4 = Lambarth| first4 = Sarah| last5 = Gomez| first5 = Natalie | last6 = Sydney| first6 = Alex | last7 = Allen | first7 = Kath| last8 = Davies | first8 = Nicole | year = 2012-13 | title = Jewel Tower - Final Interpretation Plan  | publisher = English Heritage | | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=13 September 2014 |page =5}}</ref> In 1600, a three-storey timber extension was built on the side of the tower for the clerk's use, as part of a wider renovation of the tower at a cost of <U+00A3>166, and the complex began to be termed the Parliament Office rather than the Jewel Tower.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2012|p=36}}; {{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=13}}; {{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=28}}; {{cite web| url = https://museuminsider.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Appendix-1.-The-Jewel-Tower-interpretation-plan.pdf| last1= Batty| first1 = Lorna| last2 = Ashbee| first2 = Jeremy| last3 = Kemkeran-Smith| first3 = Annie| last4 = Lambarth| first4 = Sarah| last5 = Gomez| first5 = Natalie | last6 = Sydney| first6 = Alex | last7 = Allen | first7 = Kath| last8 = Davies | first8 = Nicole | year = 2012-13 | title = Jewel Tower - Final Interpretation Plan  | publisher = English Heritage | | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=13 September 2014 |page =5}}; {{cite web| url = http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/jewel-tower/history-and-research/significance/#Fn 1| title = Significance of the Jewel Tower | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=13 September 2014 }}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Earlier scholarship had argued that the Jewel Tower began its new role as a document storage facility in 1621.

===17th - 18th centuries===
[[File:Detail of 1621 door in the Jewel Tower.jpg|thumb|Detail of the metal door on the first floor of the tower, installed in 1621]]
In 1621, a subcommittee of the House of Lords concluded that the Lords' record keeping should be improved, and the tower was renovated to improve its storage facilities.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=15}}; {{cite web| url = https://museuminsider.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Appendix-1.-The-Jewel-Tower-interpretation-plan.pdf| last1= Batty| first1 = Lorna| last2 = Ashbee| first2 = Jeremy| last3 = Kemkeran-Smith| first3 = Annie| last4 = Lambarth| first4 = Sarah| last5 = Gomez| first5 = Natalie | last6 = Sydney| first6 = Alex | last7 = Allen | first7 = Kath| last8 = Davies | first8 = Nicole | year = 2012-13 | title = Jewel Tower - Final Interpretation Plan  | publisher = English Heritage | | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=13 September 2014 |page =5}}</ref> The first floor of the tower, used to store the documents, was renovated with brick [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]], providing better [[fire protection]] than the original wooden ceiling, by Thomas Hicks at a cost of <U+00A3>6.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=11}}</ref> The chamber was further protected by a new iron door.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=16}}</ref> 

The parliamentary clerk continued to live alongside the tower, except during the [[interregnum]] of 1649 and 1660, when the House of Lords was temporarily abolished.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|pp=16-17, 24}}; {{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=30}}</ref> The sewer feeding into the moat was blocked up around the middle of the century, and the moat, which previously seems to have been kept clean, was allowed to gradually fill up with debris, despite complaints from the House of Lords that this put the Jewel Tower at greater risk of fire and thieves.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=17}}; {{harvnb|Wilson|Hurst|1957|pp=159-160}}</ref>

By 1716, the tower was reported to Parliament as being in a "ruinous condition", and an enquiry concluded that repairs and restoration should go ahead at a cost of <U+00A3>870.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|pp=17, 20}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|It is challenging to accurately compare 18th-century and modern financial sums. <U+00A3>870 in 1716 would be worth between <U+00A3>125,400 and <U+00A3>15,240,000 in 2013 terms, depending on the financial measure used.<ref name=MeasuringWorth/>|group="nb"}} The work commenced under [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], the Surveyor General, but staff turnover in the Office of Works and accusations of corruption slowed the work.<ref name=Taylor1991PP2021>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|pp=20-21}}; {{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=33}}</ref> Cut-backs were made, in particular to the plans to strengthen the roof of the tower with fire-resilient brick vaults; despite this, the costs totalled <U+00A3>1,118 by the end of the project in 1719.<ref name=Taylor1991PP2021/> The outside of the tower was reworked to form its modern appearance, with plainer, larger windows and a simpler parapet, and a new chimney to keep members of the House of Lords warm while they were reading the records.<ref name=Taylor1991PP2021/> Specialised wooden cupboards and shelves were installed on the first floor to hold the documents.<ref>{{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|pp=12-13}}</ref> Further work was carried out in 1726 to improve the security and safety of the tower, particularly from the threat of fire, at a cost of <U+00A3>508.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=21}} ;{{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=11}}</ref>

By the 19th century, the tower was obscured by the surrounding buildings, and was accessed through the brick-built office in front of it, according to the antiquarian and engraver [[John Thomas Smith (engraver)|John Smith]].<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1807|pp=33, 39}}</ref> The tower began to become too small for storing all the House of Lords' records, and from 1827 onwards only the acts, journals and minute-books were kept in the tower.<ref>{{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=35}}</ref>

A [[Burning of Parliament|fire swept through Westminster]] in 1834, destroying most of the old palace, but the Jewel Tower, which was separated from the main fire and was positioned away from the prevailing wind, survived, along with its store of records from the House of Lords.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=35}}; {{cite web| url = https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/jewel-tower/history-and-research/history/| title = History of the Jewel Tower | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=13 September 2014 }}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The records of the House of Commons were destroyed in the main fire.

In 1866, the [[Standards of Weights, Measures, and Coinage Act 1866|Standards of Weights, Measures, and Coinage Act]] was passed by Parliament, creating a department of the Board of Trade called the Standard Weights and Measures Department.<ref>{{harvnb|Turner|1983|p=51}}</ref> This department was responsible for maintaining the weights and measures used in the country - in particular, the primary and secondary [[Standard (metrology)|standard]]s, the physical "master" weights and lengths that other measuring devices could be compared against.<ref>{{harvnb|Turner|1983|p=51}}; {{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=25}}</ref> 

[[File:Weights and Measures room at the Jewel Tower, 1897.jpg|thumb|left|The weights and measures room on the ground floor in 1897]]
The house alongside the Jewel Tower was taken over by the new department in 1869, and the standards and testing equipment were installed in the tower itself, which was felt to be particularly suitable for making scientific measurements, because of its thick walls.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=25}}</ref> The roof, which was in poor condition, was repaired.<ref name=Taylor1991P26>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=26}}</ref> The ground floor was used as a weighing room and for storing glass fluid measures, the first floor held the standards of length, and the second floor was used as a museum to display old historical equipment.<ref name=Taylor1991P26/>

During the coming decades, however, the suitability of the tower for the work of the department came into question.<ref name=Taylor1991P26/> The condition of the roof remained problematic, and steel girders had to be added to support the main timbers.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=27}}</ref> Increasing traffic levels around the tower led to subsidence and high levels of vibration, effecting the operation of the delicate instruments, and worsened after the opening of [[Lambeth Bridge]] in 1932.<ref name=Taylor1991P26/> Some of the department's work was transferred to their [[Bushy House]] facility in [[Teddington]] in the 1920s, and in 1938 the department relinquished the tower altogether.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=26}}; {{cite web| url = https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/jewel-tower/history-and-research/history/| title = History of the Jewel Tower | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=13 September 2014 }}</ref>

Between 1954 and 1962, most of the buildings that had been constructed around the tower over the years, including the parliamentary legal offices, a stable, a row of houses and the [[Prime Minister]]'s chauffeur's house, were demolished, and a new garden, [[College Green (London)|College Green]], was laid out beside the tower, on top of an underground parking lot.<ref>{{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|pp=3, 17, 40}}</ref> The medieval moat was re-excavated in 1956, and filled with water between 1963 and the 1990s, when its poor water quality led to it being drained and lined with gravel.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|Hurst|1957|pp=159-160}}; {{cite web| url = https://museuminsider.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Appendix-1.-The-Jewel-Tower-interpretation-plan.pdf| last1= Batty| first1 = Lorna| last2 = Ashbee| first2 = Jeremy| last3 = Kemkeran-Smith| first3 = Annie| last4 = Lambarth| first4 = Sarah| last5 = Gomez| first5 = Natalie | last6 = Sydney| first6 = Alex | last7 = Allen | first7 = Kath| last8 = Davies | first8 = Nicole | year = 2012-13 | title = Jewel Tower - Final Interpretation Plan  | publisher = English Heritage | | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=13 September 2014 |pages =6, 8}}</ref>

Between 2007 and 2012 an average of 30,000 visitors came to the tower each year, with non-English speaking visitors making up a high proportion.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://museuminsider.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Appendix-1.-The-Jewel-Tower-interpretation-plan.pdf| last1= Batty| first1 = Lorna| last2 = Ashbee| first2 = Jeremy| last3 = Kemkeran-Smith| first3 = Annie| last4 = Lambarth| first4 = Sarah| last5 = Gomez| first5 = Natalie | last6 = Sydney| first6 = Alex | last7 = Allen | first7 = Kath| last8 = Davies | first8 = Nicole | year = 2012-13 | title = Jewel Tower - Final Interpretation Plan  | publisher = English Heritage | | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=13 September 2014 |pages = 17-18}}</ref> The architecture of the tower has made it a challenging site to operate as a tourist attraction; the fluctuating heat and humidity, and capacity constraints, have prevented it being adapted to house more delicate historical artefacts or accommodate additional visitor numbers.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://museuminsider.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Appendix-1.-The-Jewel-Tower-interpretation-plan.pdf| last1= Batty| first1 = Lorna| last2 = Ashbee| first2 = Jeremy| last3 = Kemkeran-Smith| first3 = Annie| last4 = Lambarth| first4 = Sarah| last5 = Gomez| first5 = Natalie | last6 = Sydney| first6 = Alex | last7 = Allen | first7 = Kath| last8 = Davies | first8 = Nicole | year = 2012-13 | title = Jewel Tower - Final Interpretation Plan  | publisher = English Heritage | | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=13 September 2014 |pages =11, 15}}; {{cite web|url = https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/content/imported-docs/u-z/westminsterplan.pdf|publisher =  Westminster World Heritage Site Management Plan Steering Group  | last = Atkins | title = The Palace of Westminster and Westminster Abbey, including St. Margaret<U+2019>s Church, World Heritage Site Management Plan | date = 2007| separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=13 September 2014 |pages =78, 186}}</ref>

Archaeologists have recovered over 400 objects associated with the tower, and various [[Delftware]] drinking jars and an [[Iron Age]] sword are displayed inside, along with a set of historiated [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], described by the historian Jeremy Ashbee as "important and rare examples of English Romanesque sculpture", originating from the Westminster Hall of the 1090s, and a set of weights and measures, on loan from the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=20}}; {{cite web| url = https://museuminsider.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Appendix-1.-The-Jewel-Tower-interpretation-plan.pdf| last1= Batty| first1 = Lorna| last2 = Ashbee| first2 = Jeremy| last3 = Kemkeran-Smith| first3 = Annie| last4 = Lambarth| first4 = Sarah| last5 = Gomez| first5 = Natalie | last6 = Sydney| first6 = Alex | last7 = Allen | first7 = Kath| last8 = Davies | first8 = Nicole | year = 2012-13 | title = Jewel Tower - Final Interpretation Plan  | publisher = English Heritage | | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=13 September 2014 |pages =8, 12, 14}}</ref>

==Architecture==
[[File:Plan of the Jewel Tower.jpg|thumb|250px|Plan of the ground floor of the tower; dashed lines show the vaulted ceiling design]]
The Jewel Tower is a three-story building of [[Kentish Ragstone]] with a brick parapet, structurally largely unchanged since the 14th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=14}}; {{cite web| url = http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/jewel-tower/history-and-research/description| title = Description of the Jewel Tower | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=13 September 2014 }}</ref> The walls that once faced away from the palace are finely coursed, but the interior two walls are more crudely finished.<ref>{{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=14}}</ref> The external windows are almost all 18th-century in origin and made from Portland limestone.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/jewel-tower/history-and-research/description| title = Description of the Jewel Tower | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=13 September 2014 }}</ref> The jagged remnants of the former palace walls jut out from the sides of the tower.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1991|p=28}}</ref> The moat, now dry, stretches away east from the tower, passing by the former landing stage for boats from the Thames, {{convert|6|m}} long and made from [[ashlar]] stone.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|1964|p=270}}</ref> The clearances of the post-war era mean that there are now few neighbouring buildings to the tower, and it is much more visible than in previous centuries.<ref>{{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=3}}</ref>

The ground floor of the tower is entered from the north, and is made up of two chambers, a larger room {{convert|7.5|by|4|m}}, a smaller turret room in the south-east corner, {{convert|4|by|3|m}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|pp=4, 40}}</ref> The windows in the main room are a mixture of early 18th-century designs, combined with a surviving large medieval window embrasure on the eastern side.<ref name=Ashbee2013P4>{{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=4}}</ref> The main chamber has elaborate stone vaulting, considered  by historian Jeremy Ashbee to be "one of the most impressive medieval interiors in London... an architectural masterpiece".<ref name=Ashbee2013P4/> The vaulting features 16 carved Reigate stone [[Boss (architecture)|bosses]], including grotesque heads, birds, flowers and the devil, some designed to form amusing visual illusions.<ref>{{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|pp=6-7}}; {{cite web| url = http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/jewel-tower/history-and-research/description| title = Description of the Jewel Tower | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=13 September 2014 }}</ref> The ground floor is used by English Heritage as a gift shop and cafe.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/jewel-tower/facilities| title = Facilities at Jewel Tower | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=13 September 2014 }}</ref>

The first floor is reached by a 20th-century spiral staircase, and follows the same two-room design as the first floor.<ref>{{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=12}}</ref> It has a roof of groin-vaulted Portland stone, probably from the 18th century, and the windows are mostly 18th century in origin, with one 20th century reconstruction.<ref>{{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|pp=12-13}}; {{cite web| url = http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/jewel-tower/history-and-research/description| title = Description of the Jewel Tower | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=13 September 2014 }}</ref> The iron door to the larger chamber carries the date of its installation, 1621, and its lock carries the letters "IR", standing for King James I.<ref>{{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=13}}</ref> The neighbouring room is barrel-vaulted in brick, with a recess in the wall that was originally a latrine, and the original 1719 iron-shutters on its north window.<ref>{{harvnb|Ashbee|2013|p=13}}; {{cite web| url = http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/jewel-tower/history-and-research/description| title = Description of the Jewel Tower | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=13 September 2014 }}</ref> The first floor contains an exhibit on the history of the UK Parliament.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/jewel-tower/facilities| title = Facilities at Jewel Tower | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=13 September 2014 }}</ref>
