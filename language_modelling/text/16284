Big Daddy was a Micromaster Autobot who turned into a hot rod. <ref>[http://www.cobraislandtoys.com/tf/1990/hotrodpatrol.html Cobra Island Toys - Transformer Archive<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Big Daddy earned his position as leader of the Hot Rod Patrol by being its least out-of-control member.<REF>Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye, Volume 1: Volume 1 - Page 23, by James McDonough, Adam Patyk, Don Figueroa - 2008</REF> He's the only member of the squad who can pull the others into a cohesive unit. Despite this, he's still rebellious by any conservative Autobot standards. When not on duty, the mischievous Hot Rod Patrol is often mistaken for a band of Decepticon punks, recklessly tearing up the highways for fun. This all changes when Big Daddy has to take command for a mission; he's the first to respond to emergency situations when innocents are in danger, and he's totally dedicated to defeating the Decepticons for the sake of the Autobot cause. But when the fighting's done, he just wants to let off some steam.

Big Daddy has a 16-cylinder energon-powered engine with an external intake valve that allows it to convert passing airborne particles into extra power. Big Daddy's top speed is directly proportional to the amount of particles collected; thus, the upper limits of his speed are unknown.

Big Daddy exhibits no known physical weaknesses.

===Animated series===
Although the U.S. animated series was canceled before Big Daddy was created, he did appear briefly in animated form in the commercial for his toy. The Hot Rod Patrol was introduced to Optimus Prime by Jazz, and Big Daddy even for a speaking roll.

===Dreamwave Productions===
Big Daddy was among the hundreds of Micromasters created by the Autobots and Decepticons millions of years after the launch of the Ark. While in Little Iacon, he befriended Runner, who later became the Decepticon known as Barricade. Big Daddy, along with the Hot Rod Patrol, were selected to join the Autobots. He and his team helped the Monster Truck Patrol recover Roadbuster, but clashed with his former friends in the Decepticon Race Track Patrol in the battle that ensued. Big Daddy succeeded in evacuating Roadbuster, but team member Crunch was killed in the process. 

===3H Enterprises===
Big Daddy was one of the Transformers pulled from his timestream to engage in the death-duels of the Cauldron deep inside the shattered Unicron. He escaped this fate in the jail-break set by [[Trailbreaker]] and [[Silverbolt]].

===IDW Publishing===
Big Daddy was among the Micromasters who appeared in ''Spotlight: Hardhead'' and attacked [[Nightbeat (Transformers)|Nightbeat]] and [[Hardhead (Transformers)|Hardhead]] on the planet [[Gorlam Prime]].

===Fun Publications===
Although not depicted directly, Big Daddy is one of the many Autobots aboard the Ark in ''[[Do Over (Transformers)|Do Over]]''.

While battling over Earth it is shot down by human defense systems. 

Big Daddy is among the Autobots brought back online after their crash on Earth. He initially joins a group of Autobots under the command of Goldbug, who found Rodimus after the crash of the Ark. Initially blaming Rodimus for abandoning ship, Rodimus is able to weasel his way back to leadership. Big Daddy later participates in the attack on [[Burpleson Air Force Base]]. Once the base was taken Side Burn and Big Daddy are put on guard duty.<REF>{{cite book|date=May 1, 2009|publisher=[[Fun Publications]]|author=[[Trent Troop]] and [[Greg Sepelak]]|title=[[Eye in the Sky (Transformers)|Eye in the Sky]]}}</REF>
