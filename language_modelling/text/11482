'''Diamond Valley Lake''' is man-made [[reservoir]] located in [[Hemet, California]], United States. It is one of the largest reservoirs in [[Southern California]] and also one of the newest. With {{convert|800000|acre feet}} of water, The lake nearly doubled the area<U+2019>s surface water storage capacity and provides additional water supplies for drought, peak summer, and emergency needs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dvlake.com/general_info06.html | title = Creating Diamond Valley Lake | accessdate = 2010-09-19 | work = dvllake.com}}</ref>

The [[Metropolitan Water District of Southern California]] began the $1.9 billion construction project with early planning in 1987. By 1993, the current site of Domenigoni/Diamond Valley was chosen and construction of the lake began in 1995. Filling of the lake, by way of the [[Colorado River Aqueduct]] and San Diego Canal, began in 1999 and was completed in 2003.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.water-technology.net/projects/eastside_res/specs.html | title = Eastside Reservoir Project (Diamond Valley Lake) Specs | accessdate = 2010-09-19 | work = water-technology.net}}</ref> The lake is also served and filled by the [[Inland Feeder]].

Construction of the lake resulted in many paleontological finds, many of which are displayed at the [[Western Science Center]] at the lake's East end. The lake is open to boating and fishing, along with hiking and other recreational activities around the lake.

==Geography==
Diamond Valley Lake is located within the Domenigoni/Diamond valleys, {{convert|4|mi}} southwest of the city of [[Hemet, CA|Hemet]]. The site was chosen because of its location between the cities of [[San Diego]] and [[Los Angeles]], and because of the raw materials located on-site for the construction of the three dams.<ref name='watertech'>{{cite web | url = http://www.water-technology.net/projects/eastside_res/ | title = Eastside Reservoir Project (Diamond Valley Lake), California, USA | accessdate = 2010-09-19 | work = water-technology.net}}</ref>

== Construction ==
The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California began construction of the lake in 1995 with construction of the three dams. With over 40 million cubic yards of foundation excavation and 110 million cubic yards of embankment construction, the construction of the dams was the largest [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]] project in the United States. The shovels, loaders and trucks used on the project were the largest available in the industry and established a new standard for earth and rock movement. The two rock processing plants set up for the project provided combined production exceeding the capability of any single commercial processing operation in California.<ref name='construction'>{{cite web | url = http://www.dvlake.com/general_info09.html | title = Construction | accessdate = 2010-09-19 | work = dvllake.com}}</ref> 

At its peak in 1997 and 1998, the reservoir construction project employed an average of 1,800 people. At times, more than 1,900 people labored in building the reservoir<U+2019>s three dams. From start to finish, about 5,000 people were employed by the construction project.<ref name='building'>{{cite web | url = http://www.dvlake.com/general_info04.html | title = Building The Lake | accessdate = 2010-09-19 | work = dvllake.com}}</ref>

=== The dams ===
[[File:DVL-Westdam.JPG|thumb|left|The west dam of Diamond Valley Lake]]
Construction of the three dams was completed in 1999, requiring the excavation of {{convert|31000000|m3|cuyd}} of foundation material. The [[earth fill dam]] project required about {{convert|110000000|cuyd}} of sand, clay and rock. These materials were obtained from the project area. Core materials were obtained from the silty and clayey sandy alluvium in the floor of the reservoir and the rock fill came from the bedrock highlands of the reservoir's south rim. Design and construction of the dams also took into consideration the threat of earthquakes with the [[San Jacinto Fault]] located about {{convert|6|mi}} from the reservoir and the [[San Andreas fault]] located about {{convert|6|mi}} from the reservoir.<ref name="watertech" />

==== The West Dam ====
The west dam rises to {{convert|285|ft}} above the valley floor. It spans {{convert|1.5|mi}} over a nearly flat [[alluvial]] valley floor between bedrock abutment ridges.<ref name="watertech" />

About 65% of the dam's foundation area is founded on [[quartzite]] and [[phyllite]] bedrock; the remainder is founded on dense alluvium that fills the three buried channels, which are up to {{convert|120|ft}} deep. The foundation excavations were extended {{convert|90|ft}} below the original ground surface to remove the [[liquefaction]] soils. To minimize foundation seepage through the alluvium, {{convert|3|ft}} thick cut-off walls of plastic concrete were constructed across the three alluvial channels and excavated at least {{convert|2|ft}} into bedrock. To reduce seepage through the rock foundation the entire core width was consolidation grouted and a double-line grout curtain was installed to a depth of approximately {{convert|125|ft}}.<ref name="watertech" /> Grouting of the west dam took about two years to complete and required {{convert|189|mi}} of grout holes.<ref name="watertech" />

==== The East Dam ====
The {{convert|2.1|mi}} long East Dam, constructed by a Kiewit-led joint venture, is the longest of the three dams. It measures {{convert|1200|ft}} wide at the base and {{convert|40|ft}} wide at the top. Before embankment of the dam could begin, more than {{convert|18000000|cuyd}} of alluvium had to be excavated to reach a solid bedrock foundation.<ref name="watertech" />

The embankment required {{convert|43000000|cuyd}} of crushed rock. An on-site crushing plant crushed and processed over 14 million tons of rock in 20 months to supply the dam's materials. The cut-off wall, which consists of a {{convert|3|ft}} thick plastic concrete mix constructed through the weathered portion of bedrock, varies in depth from {{convert|10|ft}} to {{convert|110|ft}} and totals {{convert|250000|sqft|m2}}. A two-line grout curtain reaches depths of {{convert|150|ft}} below the foundation in the north segment of the East Dam and {{convert|100|ft}} in the south segment.<ref name="watertech" />

Because of the amount of material use in the construction of the east dam, some of the biggest trucks in the world had to be brought to the site. Twelve [[Caterpillar 789 dump truck]]'s were used in construction of the East Dam. The trucks, costing $1.4 million each, weighed up to 350 tons when full of rock, and use a {{convert|1800|hp}} engine that burns 40 gallons of fuel per hour. They were so big that they had to be brought to the reservoir site in pieces and assembled on site.<ref name='building' />

==== The Saddle Dam ====
The Saddle Dam rises {{convert|130|ft}} above the lowest point in the ridgeline of the north rim and is around {{convert|0.5|mi}} long. it is founded completely on [[phyllite]] and [[schist]] bedrock. To minimise foundation seepage, a two-line grout curtain extends up to {{convert|100|ft}} below the foundation.<ref name="watertech" />

=== Filling the lake ===
Filling of the lake began in 1999 with water provided by the [[Colorado River Aqueduct]] and San Diego Canal. Water would first enter the fore-bay, a {{convert|35|acre|m2|adj=on}}   163 million gallon basin that held the water before being pumped through the pumping station. The Hiram W. Wadsworth Pumping Station features twelve {{convert|6000|hp}} pumps for moving water from the forebay to the intake-outlet (I/O) tower.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DIAMOND+VALLEY+LAKE+RESERVOIR+DEDICATED+PROJECT+DOUBLES+REGION%27S...-a083421758 | title = Diamond Valley Lake Resrvour Dedicated Project Doubles Region's Storage Capacity | accessdate = 2010-09-19 | last = Silva | first = Andrew | date = March 19, 2000 | work = Daily News}}</ref> In 2001, four of the twelve pumps were converted to [[hydroelectric]] turbine generators capable of producing 3 megawatts of power each. If all the pumps were converted, the entire facility could produce up to 40 megawatts of power.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mwdh2o.com/mwdh2o/pages/yourwater/supply/wadsworth01.html | title = Hiram W. Wadsworth Hydroelectric Generator at Diamond Valley Lake | accessdate = 2010-09-19 | work = MWDh2o.com}}</ref>

Water is pumped from the pumping station, located just outside of the west dam, through a {{convert|2000|ft|m|adj=on}} long, {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter pipe and into the lake via the I/O tower.  At peak rate, water flowed into the lake at {{convert|1000|cuft|m3}}  per second. Filling of the lake finished in 2003<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dvlake.com/general_info03.html | title = Flowing Along | accessdate = 2010-09-19 | work = dvllake.com}}</ref>

In 2009, the lake began being filled with water provided by the [[Inland Feeder]] after nearly two years without a source. The water replenished much of what was lost after drought conditions required the MWD to tap into the lake. Water from the Colorado River Aqueduct is not being used due to the threat of the [[Quagga mussel]], an [[invasive species]] that has already contaminated other Southern California lakes served by the aqueduct.<ref>{{cite news | first = Bob | last = Pratte | title = Water deliveries back at lake | date = June 20, 2009 | work = The Press Enterprise | accessdate = 2010-09-20}}</ref>

== Paleontological finds ==
[[File:WCAP Paramylodon harlani 1.jpg|thumb|A [[Paramylodon harlani]] on display at the [[Western Science Center]]]]
During [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]], bones and skeletons were found from extinct [[mastodons]], [[mammoth]], [[camel]], [[sloth]], [[dire wolf]] and [[long-horned bison]].  
[[Paleontologists]] from the [[San Bernardino County Museum]] in Redlands, California uncovered thousands of [[fossils]] in the Diamond and Domenigoni valleys that will add immensely to the store of public knowledge about the region.  Collectively, these animal fossils are named the Diamond Valley Lake Local Fauna<ref name="Springeretal.2009">{{cite book | author = Springer, K., E. Scott, J.C. Sagebiel, and L.K. Murray | year = 2009 | title = ''The Diamond Valley Lake local fauna: late Pleistocene vertebrates from inland southern California. In'' Papers on Geology, Vertebrate Paleontology, and Biostratigraphy in Honor of Michael O. Woodburne ''(ed. L.B. Albright III)'' | pages = 217<U+2013>235 | location = Flagstaff | publisher = Museum of Northern Arizona}}</ref>.

The [[paleontological]] finds of [[mammoth]], [[mastodon]], [[bison]], and other [[Pleistocene]] Epoch species from Diamond Valley Lake provide a unique snapshot on inland southern California during the Ice Ages, and bridge a massive data gap between fossil deposits at [[La Brea tar pits]] in Los Angeles, California and Ice Age sites in the Mojave Desert. Unofficially, the Diamond Valley Lake area is often referred to as the "Valley of the Mastodons". Fossils from the Diamond Valley Lake site comprise a classic late Pleistocene assemblage which includes the following extinct animals:<ref name="Springeretal.2009"/>

*Jefferson<U+2019>s ground sloth, ''[[Megalonyx jeffersonii]]''
*Harlan<U+2019>s ground sloth, ''[[Paramylodon harlani]]''
*Dire wolf, ''[[Canis dirus]]''
*Giant Short-faced bear, ''[[Arctodus simus]]''
*Sabre-toothed cat, ''[[Smilodon fatalis]]''
*American lion, ''[[Panthera leo atrox]]''
*American mastodon, ''[[Mammut americanum]]''
*Columbian mammoth, ''[[Mammuthus columbi]]''
*Western horse, ''[[Equus <U+201C>occidentalis]]<U+201D>''
*Small horse, ''[[Equus conversidens]]''
*Flat-headed peccary, ''[[Platygonus compressus]]''
*<U+201C>Yesterday<U+2019>s<U+201D> camel, ''[[Camelops hesternus]]''
*Ancient bison, ''[[Bison antiquus]]''
*Long-horned bison, ''[[Bison latifrons]]''
*Diminutive Pronghorn, ''[[Capromeryx minor]]''

Many fossils of rabbits, rodents and pond turtles, as well as coyotes, deer and the Black bear, have been recovered as well. One of the most common animals identified from the Diamond Valley Lake site by San Bernardino County Museum scientists was the extinct American mastodon, ''Mammut americanum''<ref name="Springeretal.2009"/><ref name="Springeretal.2010">{{cite journal | author = Springer, K., E. Scott, J.C. Sagebiel, and L.K. Murray | year = 2010 | title = Late Pleistocene large mammal faunal dynamics from inland southern California: the Diamond Valley Lake local fauna | journal = Quat. Int. | doi = 10.1016/j.quaint.2009.10.041}}</ref>.  In North American paleontology, mastodons are thought to have been solitary forest-dwelling browsers.  The abundance of mastodons in the fossil record from the site suggests that, during the last Ice Age, the Diamond Valley Lake site was more wooded or forested than today.  Fossil remains of ponderosa pine and manzanita recovered from the site lend credence to this interpretation<ref name="Springeretal.2010"/>. Radiometric dating of fossil plants from the Diamond Valley Lake site confirms an age range of less than 13,000 years ago to more than 60,000 years ago for these fossils<ref name="Springeretal.2010"/>.

== Recreation ==
Diamond Valley Lake offers fishing and light boating on the lake. A recreation park, aquatic center, visitor center and the [[Western Science Center]] along with the lake marina are located on the eastern end of the lake. A viewpoint, offering views of the pumping station and I/O tower, along with most of the lake is located on the western end of the lake. To the south of the lake is the Southwestern Riverside County Multi-Species Reserve, a {{convert|13500|acre|km2 sqmi}} preserve between Diamond Valley Lake and [[Lake Skinner]]. The reserve is home to at least 16 sensitive, endangered or threatened native California bird, animal and plant species.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dvlake.com/general_info01.html | title = About Diamond Valley Lake | accessdate = 2010-09-19 | work = dvllake.com}}</ref>

Stocking of the lake with fish began before reservoir was filled with a small rearing pond being placed on the bottom of the valley. The lake has several species of freshwater Fish; [[Largemouth Bass]], [[Smallmouth Bass]], [[Bluegill]], [[Crappie]], [[Rainbow Trout]], [[Striped Bass]], [[Channel Catfish]], and [[Shad]]. It is considered one of the best fisheries in [[California]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dvmarina.com/faq/fishing.php | title = Frequently Asked Questions: Fishing | accessdate = 2010-09-19 | work = dvmarina.com}}</ref>

[[File:DVL-East-Panorama.jpg|thumb|700px|center|The East Dam and recreation park of Diamond Valley Lake. The aquatic center and Western Science Center can be seen at the far right.]]

Much of the area around the lake remains undeveloped and empty. Original plans included large recreation areas on both the eastern and western end of the lake complete with golf courses, camping grounds, swimming lakes, water parks and other amenities. The MWD still plans on building the additional recreation facilities, but lack of funding and lack of support from developers has prevented them from doing so.<ref>{{cite news | first1 = Herbert | last1 = Atienza | first2 = Erica | last2 = Shen | title = Without financing, Diamond Valley Lake plans flounder | date = February 10, 2009 | url = http://www.pe.com/localnews/inland/stories/PE_News_Local_S_lake10.47f416c.html | work = The Press Enterprise | accessdate = 2010-09-19}}</ref>
