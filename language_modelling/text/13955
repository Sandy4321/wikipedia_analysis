The '''Rosendale Theatre''' is a three-story, 300-seat [[movie theater]] and performance [[Music venue|venue]] in [[Rosendale Village, New York|Rosendale Village]], a hamlet and former village in the [[Rosendale, New York|town of Rosendale]] in [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]], [[New York]]. The building was initially opened as a [[casino]] in 1905, and began showing films in the 1920s. By the 1930s, a stage had been installed for live [[vaudeville]] and [[burlesque]] acts. The casino was eventually taken over by the local government, and was used to house the town's [[fire department]].

A retired [[tile]] setter, Anthony Cacchio Sr., rented the building and converted it into a movie theater. The Theatre opened on February&nbsp;18, 1949 with a screening of the film ''[[Blood on the Moon]]''. In its early years, the Theatre showed about 300 different movies each year, making it unpopular with [[film distributor]]s. Denied easy access to [[First run (film)|first run films]], the Theatre turned to [[Independent film|independent movies]] and [[art film]]s, and eventually began exhibiting live performances. Cacchio's entire family helped run the Theatre; his wife Fannie sold tickets and determined the Theatre's movie selection, while their sons Anthony Jr. and Rocco, and grandson Michael, ran the projector and eventually managed the day-to-day operation of the business.

After more than 60 years of continuous operation, the Cacchio family decided to sell the Theatre. Rather than sell to [[real estate]] developers, the Cacchios preferred to transfer the property to the Rosendale Theatre Collective, a [[501(c) organization|501(c)]] nonprofit formed in late 2009 for the sole purpose of buying and preserving the Theatre. The group spent months raising funds for a down payment on the building, with the bulk of its money coming from small individual donations. About 60 fundraisers were held, and a large grant was provided by [[PepsiCo]] after the Theatre Collective ran a successful [[Social networking service|social networking]] campaign for the April 2010 [[Pepsi Refresh Project]]. The Cacchios transfered ownership of the property to the Theatre Collective on August&nbsp;19, 2010. Since its purchase, the Theatre has had several equipment upgrades, including a move to [[digital cinema]].

=== Construction and early use ===

The first building constructed on the site now occupied by the Theatre was reputedly a [[blacksmith]] shop, erected during the 19th&nbsp;century to service the [[Rosendale cement|town's cement mills]] and the [[Delaware and Hudson Canal]].<ref name="55-years">{{Cite news |title=Rosendale Theater: 55 Years Under Cacchio Family Management |first=Sid |last=Norinsky |date=2004-01-16 |newspaper=Blue Stone Press |publisher=Ulster County Press |location=Stone Ridge, NY |pages=12<U+2013>13 |issue=2 |volume=8}}</ref> The current three-story<ref name="55-years" /> structure was opened in 1905<ref name="gems">{{Cite news |url=http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2009/02/01/life/doc4984ec134e69c153763080.txt?viewmode=fullstory |title=Screen gems |newspaper=[[Daily Freeman]] |location=Kingston, NY |date=2009-02-01 |accessdate=2011-08-02 |first=Kathryn |last=Heidecker}}</ref> as the Rosendale [[Casino]].<ref name="roll" /> As a casino, the building doubled as a [[Theater (structure)|theater]], screening movies in the 1920s.<ref name="55-years" />

The following decade, the casino began exhibiting [[burlesque]] and [[vaudeville]] acts to draw crowds,<ref name="55-years" /> and a raised stage was installed for the live performances.<ref name="roll" /> The building eventually became village property,<ref name="stargazing" /> and housed the town's [[Fire station|fire house]].<ref name="55-years" /> Known as Firemen's Hall, the building was also used by the town's fire department as a [[basketball court]].

The Cacchio family owned the building outright by 1954,<ref name="stargazing" /> and in 1955 the [[Rondout Creek]] flooded,<ref name="roll" /> filling the Theatre with {{convert|3|ft|m}} of water and destroying its contents.<ref name="gems" /> The Cacchios took out loans and received relief funds from the government to rebuild.<ref name="roll" /> New projection and sound equipment was installed, along with "pull-handle vending machines".<ref name="chronogram-2001">{{Cite journal |title=Rosendale Theatre |first=Pauline |last=Uchmanowicz |date=February 2001 |journal=Chronogram |publisher=Luminary Publishing Inc}}</ref> A [[Popcorn maker|popcorn machine]] was added, but broke down in 1965 and was not replaced.<ref name="chronogram-2001" /> While most movie theaters at the time generated profit by selling concessions, Anthony Cacchio Jr. made the bold decision to ban popcorn in the Theatre in 1964 because it was "too smelly, messy on the seats, and crackling paper bags disrupted quiet scenes".<ref name="stargazing" />

Anthony Cacchio Jr. was trained to operate the Theatre's equipment by one of his employees, a [[Trade union|union]] projectionist<ref name="history-film">{{Cite news |url=http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2005/11/13/life/15562470.txt |title=History on film |newspaper=[[Daily Freeman]] |location=Kingston, NY |date=2005-11-13 |accessdate=2011-08-02 |first=Blaise |last=Schweitzer}}</ref> who left in 1966 to work at a different theater in Kingston.<ref name="gems" />  By 1980, the cost of tickets was half that of competing, larger theaters, and annual attendance was between 40,000 and 50,000 people.<ref name="stargazing" />

Anthony Cacchio Sr. had had a [[stroke]] by the late 1990s, but continued to work at the Theatre. He wore a suit to work each day,<ref name="roll" /> including the day before his death<ref name="chronogram-2001" /> in 1998. That same year his grandson, Michael Cacchio, began to help run the Theatre.<ref name="history-film" /> Michael Cacchio supported the introduction of live performances at the Theatre, and was the primary reason the Theatre began exhibiting arts films,<ref name="roll" /> though his grandmother Fannie Cacchio remained the "power broker" who determined which movies were shown.<ref name="golden-anniversary" /> She reputedly warned moviegoers if a film was of poor quality<ref name="55-years" /> or [[Obscenity|obscene]], and continued to work at the Theatre until her death in 2004.<ref name="roll" />

The history of the Theatre was documented in an 8-minute, 26-second film by four local teenagers.<ref name="history-film" /> The four were attending a screening of ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' at the Theatre, during which a member of the audience announced that it was Fannie Cacchio's 93rd birthday. The teens, enrolled in a summer film camp, were seeking to create a documentary and decided to make the Theatre their subject.

The Cacchios expressed a desire to sell the Theatre to the RTC rather than to developers, because the RTC consisted of friends of the family and other residents whom the Cacchios trusted to maintain and preserve the Theatre.
