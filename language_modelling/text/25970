'''Josce de Dinan''' (sometimes '''Joce de Dinan''',<ref name=Chibnall123/> '''Josselin de Dinan'''',<ref name=Jones20/> '''Joce de Dynan''';<ref name=Introxvi>Hathaway, et al. "Introduction" ''Fouke le Fitz Warin'' p. xvi</ref> '''Jocelin de Dinan''',<ref name=Lords18>Holden ''Lords of the Central Marches'' p. 18</ref> '''Joyce de Dinan''', or '''Joceas de Dinan''';<ref name=Burgess96>Burgess "Introduction: The Romance of Fouke Fitz Warin" ''Two Medieval Outlaws'' p. 96</ref> died 1166) was an [[Anglo-Norman]] nobleman who lived during the early years of the [[The Anarchy|civil war]] between King [[Stephen of England]] and his cousin [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]] over the throne of England. He was a landholder in the [[Welsh Marches]] when he was married by Stephen to the widow of [[Pain fitzJohn]], a marriage which gained Josce control of [[Ludlow Castle]]. This control was contested by other noblemen, and the resulting warfare between the nobles forms the background to a late medieval [[Romance (genre)|romance]] known as ''[[Fouke le Fitz Waryn]]'', which is mainly concerned with the actions of Josce's grandson, but also includes some material on Josce's lifetime. Josce eventually lost control of Ludlow and was granted compensating lands by Matilda and her son, King [[Henry II of England]], who succeeded Stephen in 1154.

==Early life and background==

Josce was the youngest son of Geoffrey de [[Dinan]] and Radegonde Orieldis,<ref name=DD434/> and had two older brothers, Oliver of Dinan and Alan of Becherel.<ref name=Jones20>Jones ''Family of Dinan'' p. 20</ref> Josce was of Breton extraction, and was described by the historian [[Marjorie Chibnall]] as an "obscure Breton adventurer".<ref name=QChibnall123>Quoted in Chibnall ''Empress Matilda'' p. 123</ref> Josce moved from Devon in southern England to the Welsh Marches, the border between England and Wales, because the lords of [[Monmouth]] were also of Breton extraction. While in the Marches he joined King Stephen's household.<ref>Coplestone-Crow "From Foundation to the Anarchy" ''Ludlow Castle: Its History & Buildings'' p.&nbsp;27</ref>

Following King [[Henry I of England|Henry I's]] death in 1135, the succession was disputed between the king's nephews<U+2014>[[Stephen of England|Stephen]] and his elder brother, [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne]]<U+2014>and Henry's surviving legitimate child [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]], usually known as the Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]]. King Henry's only legitimate son, [[William Adelin|William]], had died in 1120. After Matilda was widowed in 1125, she returned to her father, who married her to [[Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey, Count of Anjou]]. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry's heir, but when Henry I died in 1135, Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned before either Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France. Matilda, though, was less sanguine, and secured the support of the Scottish king, [[David I of Scotland|David]], who was her maternal uncle, and in 1138 also the support of her half-brother, [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert, Earl of Gloucester]], an illegitimate son of Henry I.{{efn|Henry I had more than 20 illegitimate children.<ref name=HenryI41>Hollister ''Henry I'' p. 41</ref>}} Nobles in the Welsh Marches revolted against Stephen in 1136, but was not settled until 1138. In 1139, Matilda invaded southern England with her half-brother's support and the period of civil war began.<ref name=Huscroft71>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 71<U+2013>73</ref>

==Ludlow Castle==

Josce was married to Sybil, the widow of [[Pain fitzJohn]]. Sybil had held Ludlow Castle, an important strategic stronghold for control of the [[Welsh Borders]], against Stephen in 1139, but surrendered after a siege, and Stephen then married the widow to someone he felt was trustworthy.<ref name=Crouch102>Crouch ''Reign of King Stephen'' p. 102 and footnote 55</ref> With his marriage to the widow, Josce also acquired control of the castle.<ref name=Chibnall123/>{{efn|A bridge located near Ludlow Castle is named Dinham Bridge, and this is often erroneously held to have been named after Josce.<ref name=Jones20/>}} Josce probably also received many of the de Lacy holdings in southern Shropshire.<ref name=Lords18/> However, he rebelled against Stephen and fortified Ludlow against the king. His position was strong enough that at one point, when Stephen granted much of the surrounding lands to [[Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester|Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester]], Ludlow was specifically exempted. Stephen told Robert that he could have a royal grant of the castle if he could secure Josce's submission as a vassal.<ref name=Chibnall123>Chibnall ''Empress Matilda'' pp. 123<U+2013>124</ref>

Custody of Ludlow was contested not just by Stephen but also by [[Gilbert de Lacy]], and his efforts to wrest the castle from Josce are the background to the medieval romance ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn''.<ref name=Ludlow181>Coplestone-Crow "Payn fitzJohn and Ludlow Castle" ''Shropshire History and Archaeology'' p. 181</ref> Gilbert claimed the castle through his familial link with Sybil, fitzJohn's widow, who was a member of the [[de Lacy]] family.<ref name=Ludlow180>Coplestone-Crow "Payn fitzJohn and Ludlow Castle" ''Shropshire History and Archaeology'' p. 180</ref> Others trying to take Ludlow were [[Hugh de Mortimer]] and Walter de Lacy.<ref name=Castles212/> According to the ''Chronicle of Wigmore Abbey'', sometime after September 1148{{efn|The date is determined by the elevation of [[Gilbert Foliot]] as [[Bishop of Hereford]], which took place in September 1148.<ref name=LC32>Coplestone-Crow "From Foundation to the Anarchy" ''Ludlow Castle: Its History & Buildings'' p. 32</ref>}} Mortimer and Josce became embroiled in a private war, during which Mortimer was seized by Josce while travelling and was imprisoned in Ludlow. Josce demanded a ransom of 3,000 silver [[mark (money)|marks]],<ref name=LC32/> as well as, according to the Chronicle, Mortimer's "plate, his horses, and his birds".<ref name=QLC32>Quoted in Coplestone-Crow "From Foundation to the Anarchy" ''Ludlow Castle: Its History & Buildings'' p. 32</ref>{{efn|Plate in this would refer to his eating utinsils, usually made of silver or other precious metals. His birds here would have referred to his hawks or falcons used in [[falconry]].}} Presumably, Mortimer met the ransom, as he is later known to have been a free man.<ref name=LC32/>

While Josce de Dinan was absent from Ludlow capturing Hugh de Mortimer, Walter de Lacy was able to take the castle. Josce laid siege to the castle but was unsuccessful in his attempt,<ref name=Castles212>Pettifer ''English Castles'' p. 212</ref> and retreated to [[Lambourn]] with his military forces.<ref name=Chibnall123/> Although the exact date of this event is unknown, it appears to have been sometime about 1150 or shortly before.<ref name=LC34>Coplestone-Crow "From Foundation to the Anarchy" ''Ludlow Castle: Its History & Buildings'' p. 34</ref> Matilda gave Josce some lands around Lambourn after Ludlow's fall as compensation.<ref name=Chibnall125>Chibnall ''Empress Matilda'' p. 125</ref> Later, he was given land in Berkshire by King Henry II, Matilda's son, as further recompense for the loss of Ludlow.<ref name=DD434>Keats-Rohan ''Domesday Descendants'' p. 434</ref> In 1156, Josce held lands in Berkshire, Wiltshire, Hampshire, Devonshire and Somerset. These holdings included the manor of Lambourn, worth <U+00A3>76 in income per year, as well as the manor of Stanton (now known as [[Stanton Fitzwarren]] in Wiltshire) in addition to the other lands scattered in other counties.<ref name=Jones28>Jones ''Family of Dinan'' p. 28</ref>

The work ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'' appears to confuse events that happened to Josce with those of his grandson [[Fulk FitzWarin]], the ostensible hero of the poem.<ref name=Jones30/> Other errors are making some of the [[Welsh Marches|Welsh Marcher]] barons during the reign of King [[Henry I of England]] into nobles of [[William the Conqueror]]'s time as well as omitting an entire generation of fitz Warins.<ref name=Introxxviii>Hathaway, et al. "Introduction" ''Fouke le Fitz Warin'' p. xxviii</ref> This makes it a problematic source for Josce's life, although it does appear to have been based on genuine traditions, it is difficult to separate out which events happened to Josce and which occurred during his grandon's life instead.<ref name=Jones30>Jones ''Family of Dinan'' p. 30</ref>

==Family==

Josce de Dinan was survived by two daughters: Sibil, who died in 1212 and married Hugh de Pulgenet, and Hawise who married [[Fulk FitzWarin (d 1197)|Fulk FitzWarin]].<ref name=DD434/> He died in 1166.<ref name=DD434/> In 1199 his two daughters petitioned the king regarding the ownership of the town and castle of Ludlow but were turned down.<ref>Coplestone-Crow "The End of the Anarchy to the de Genevilles" ''Ludlow Castle: Its History & Buildings'' pp.&nbsp;36<U+2013>37</ref>
