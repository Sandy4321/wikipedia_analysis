The '''2001 UEFA Cup Final''' was an [[association football]] match between [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] of [[England]] and [[Deportivo Alav<U+00E9>s|Alav<U+00E9>s]] of [[Spain]] on 16 May 2001 at the [[Westfalenstadion]], [[Dortmund]], [[Germany]]. The showpiece event was the final match of the [[2000<U+2013>01 UEFA Cup|2000<U+2013>01]] edition of Europe's secondary cup competition, the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. Liverpool were appearing in their third UEFA Cup final, after their appearances in [[1973 UEFA Cup Final|1973]] and [[1976 UEFA Cup Final|1976]]. It also represented the first European final they reached since being banned from Europe following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. Alav<U+00E9>s were appearing in their first European final.

Each team had to progress through six knockout rounds playing 12 matches in total to reach the final. Liverpool's matches were mainly close affairs, none of their ties were won by more than two goals. The fourth round and semi-final ties against [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] were won 1<U+2013>0. In contrast, Alav<U+00E9>s ties ranged from close affairs to comfortable victories. They won their first round tie against [[Gaziantepspor]] by one goal, whereas they beat [[Kaiserslautern]] 9<U+2013>2 in the semi-final.

Watched by a crowd of 48,050, Liverpool took an early lead when [[Markus Babbel]] scored in the fourth minute. They extended their lead in the 16th minute when [[Steven Gerrard]] scored. Midway through the first half, [[Iv<U+00E1>n Alonso]] scored to bring Alav<U+00E9>s within a goal of levelling the match. A few minutes before the end of the first half, Liverpool went 3<U+2013>1 up when [[Gary McAllister]] scored from the penalty spot. Minutes after the start of the second half, [[Javi Moreno]] scored twice to level the match at 3<U+2013>3. Liverpool went in front again in the 76th minute when [[Robbie Fowler]] scored. With a minute remaining in the match, Alav<U+00E9>s equalised thanks to a [[Jordi Cruyff]] scored. The match went into [[Overtime (sports)|extra-time]], with the first half goalless. With the match heading for a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]], [[Delf<U+00ED> Geli]] headed into his own net, as a result, Liverpool won on the [[golden goal]] rule. The victory meant Liverpool completed a [[Treble (association football)|Treble]] of [[Football League Cup]], [[FA Cup]] and UEFA Cup.

Liverpool went into the match having already won two trophies during the [[2000<U+2013>01 Liverpool F.C. season|2000<U+2013>01 season]]. Their first trophy was the [[Football League Cup]] which they had won in February defeating [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] 5<U+2013>4 in a [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] after the match had finished [[2001 Football League Cup Final|1<U+2013>1]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/worthington_cup/1187654.stm |title=Blues shot down as Liverpool lift cup |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 February 2001 |accessdate=21 April 2011 }}</ref> The second trophy was the [[FA Cup]], which they won [[2001 FA Cup Final|2<U+2013>1]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2001/may/13/match.sport |title=Owen spikes the Gunners |work=The Observer |location=London |first=Paul |last=Wilson |date=13 May 2001 |accessdate=21 April 2011 }}</ref> They entered the match with the opportunity to win an unprecedented [[Treble (association football)|Treble]]. 

Liverpool were appearing in their third UEFA Cup final, both their previous appearances in the final in [[1973 UEFA Cup Final|1973]] and [[1976 UEFA Cup Final|1976]] had resulted in victory. They were also making their first appearance in a European final since their ban from European competition following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/1287618.stm |title=Liverpool's European Odyssey |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 May 2001 |accessdate=21 April 2001 }}</ref> Alav<U+00E9>s on the other hand were appearing in their first European final in their first season in European competition. Remarkably, the club had been in the Fourth Division of the Spanish league system 11 years ago. As it was their first season in Europe, Alav<U+00E9>s had commissioned a special shirt that was pink and bore the names of all their 'socios' (members) as a memento of their qualification for Europe. 

Liverpool opted for a 4<U+2013>4<U+2013>2 formation, with the only change from their FA Cup winning team four days earlier being the inclusion of Gary McAllister at the expense of [[Vladim<U+00ED>r <U+0160>micer]]. [[Robbie Fowler]] who had been disappointed to be a substitute for the FA Cup final was again on the bench. [[Emile Heskey]] and [[Michael Owen]] were picked to spearhead Liverpool's attack. Alav<U+00E9>s opted to play a 5<U+2013>3<U+2013>2 formation, with [[Cosmin Contra]], [[Dan Eggen]], [[Antonio Karmona]], [[<U+00D3>scar T<U+00E9>llez]] and [[Delf<U+00ED> Geli]] in defence. In attack, [[Mart<U+00ED>n Astudillo]] and [[Jordi Cruyff]] were chosen to play behind lone striker [[Javi Moreno]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/2001/05/16/uefacup_running/ |title=UEFA Cup Final: Alav<U+00E9>s vs. Liverpool |work=Reuters |publisher=Sports Illustrated |date=16 May 2001 |accessdate=21 April 2001 }}</ref>

==Post match==
Liverpool's victory was their third UEFA Cup success, this put them level with [[FC Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] as the teams with the most success in the competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/history/index.html |title=History |publisher=Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) |date=26 September 2008 |accessdate=21 April 2011 |archiveurl=http://replay.web.archive.org/20090429075102/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/history/index.html |archivedate=29 April 2009 }}</ref> Their victory also meant they completed a Treble of cup victories, as they had won the [[Football League Cup]] and the [[FA Cup]] earlier in the season. 

The match has hailed as one of the most exciting finals in modern times ,with [[Alan Hansen]] declaring: "the best final ever."<ref name="Hansen">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/uefa_cup/1334148.stm |title=Hansen: 'Best game ever' |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 May 2001 |accessdate=21 April 2011 }}</ref> Liverpool manager [[Gerard Houllier]] hailed his players after the match: "When you play in a European final, you are looking for immortality. People remember who was playing and when you look at programmes from finals you just recall the facts of the game. These boys have produced a game which will be remembered for a long time <U+2014> and that is thanks to Alav<U+00E9>s too."<ref name="Houllier">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/uefa_cup/1335207.stm |title=Houllier hails brilliant Reds |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 May 2001 |accessdate=21 April 2011 }}</ref> Houllier hit back at critics that had labelled Liverpool as boring before the match: "Maybe we are a boring side <U+2014> as I seem to keep reading <U+2014> but I will put up with that. We must have scored 122 of our 123 goals on the counter attack, but all I know is that our total this season is the third highest in Liverpool's history."<ref name="Houllier" />

The performance of Gary McAllister was lauded after the match with [[Trevor Brooking]] stating: "Gary McAllister was outstanding."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/uefa_cup/1334161.stm |title=McAllister the man |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 May 2001 |accessdate=21 April 2011 }}</ref> Alan Hansen also praised McAllister's performance: "Gary McAllister was outstanding. At 36, to keep going the way he did, keep taking those free-kicks and producing it when it counted, was sensational. He fully deserved his man of the match award."<ref name="Hansen" /> 

Alav<U+00E9>s manager [[Jos<U+00E9> Manuel Esnal]] praised his players despite their loss: "Dortmund has seen a great final, and it was possibly the smallest team in the competition that made it great." Esnal saluted his players for their character especially for equalising twice in the match: "We played with pride and class to get the score back to 4<U+2013>4 at the end of normal time, the result of that, however, was that we were half dead going into extra-time. But we're the same team as we were two hours ago. One side always has to lose a final, just as one wins."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/uefa_cup/1335119.stm |title=Alav<U+00E9>s proud in defeat |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 May 2001 |accessdate=21 April 2011 }}</ref>

Despite their success, Liverpool were not celebrating immediately after the match, as they had an important match in the [[Premier League]] on the Saturday following the final. The match against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] was a must-win match for Liverpool if they wanted to finish in third place in the league and claim the final [[UEFA Champions League]] qualification place. The subsequent match was won 4<U+2013>0 by Liverpool to secure their place in the [[2001<U+2013>02 UEFA Champions League]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1338359.stm |title=Liverpool party begins at Charlton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 May 2001 |accessdate=22 April 2011 }}</ref> Winning the UEFA Cup entitled Liverpool to compete in the [[2001 UEFA Super Cup]] against Champions League winners [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]].
