==History==
Keith, Nobel & O'Dell began playing together in the early 1990s, and quickly amassed a dedicated following by performing their original material at Borders bookstores up and down the East Coast. 

They were originally named Sojourn and released two albums (Songs of Leaving and Further On) but had to surrender the name to another group with an earlier claim.

Their following helped foster sales of two independently-released albums, "Songs of Leaving" and "Further On" for their self-owned label, Sojourn Hills Records.  In 1996, they signed with Mercury Records and released "Eventide" (1997) and "Painted Pictures" (1998).  An additional [[extended play|EP]] sold exclusively on the [[internet]], entitled "One Day Soon," was the band's last release on Mercury Records before it was merged into a larger label.  

To ensure their continued growth, the band recently purchased back rights to material produced while they were with Mercury and released four additional special compilations of rare and live material that was sold via the internet to their most dedicated fans.

[[Brett Kull]] and Paul Ramsey are also in the [[progrock]] group [[echolyn]], having first met Grey Eye Glances in Nashville while recording their [[As The World]] album.
