'''''The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo''''' is a 2011 American [[Thriller (genre)|thriller film]]. Based on the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo|novel of the same name]] by [[Stieg Larsson]], the film adaptation was directed by [[David Fincher]] and written by [[Steven Zaillian]]. [[Atticus Ross]] and [[Trent Reznor]] provided the soundtrack. The film stars [[Daniel Craig]] and [[Rooney Mara]] and tells the story of journalist Mikael Blomqvist's (Craig) mission to find out what happened to a woman who had disappeared over forty years before. He works with the help of computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Mara).

A concerted effort by [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] associates [[Michael Lynton]] and [[Amy Pascal]] to create the film started in 2009. It took the company a few months to obtain rights to the novel, during which they recruited Zaillian and Fincher. The casting process for the lead roles was exhaustive and intense; Craig initially faced scheduling conflicts, while a plethora of actresses sought the role of Lisbeth Salander. The film's script took over six months to write, which included three months of analyzing the novel. With a production budget of $90 million, filming took place in Sweden, Switzerland and Norway over seven months.

Pre-release screenings occurred in London, New York City, and Stockholm. Critics positively reviewed the film, applauding its dark, grim tone. Mara and Craig's performances also received kudos from commentators. The film garnered $232.6 million over its theatrical run. In addition to being included in the best-of lists in several publications, the film was a candidate for numerous awards, ultimately winning seven accolades including an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].

== Synopsis ==
Mikael Blomkvist ([[Daniel Craig]]), co-owner of ''Millennium'' magazine, has just lost a [[libel]] case brought against him by crooked businessman Hans-Erik Wennerstr<U+00F6>m ([[Ulf Friberg]]).  Lisbeth Salander ([[Rooney Mara]]), a damaged but brilliant researcher and computer hacker, compiled an extensive background check on Blomkvist for Swedish magnate Henrik Vanger ([[Christopher Plummer]]), who has a special task for him. In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerstr<U+00F6>m, Blomkvist agrees to move into a cabin at the Vanger estate to investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henrik's grandniece, Harriet, 40 years before. Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing a list of names and numbers that no one has been able to decipher.

Salander, who is under state legal guardianship due to mental incompetency, is appointed a new guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman ([[Yorick van Wageningen]]). He abuses his authority to extort sexual favors from Salander and then forcibly rapes her, not realizing she has a hidden video camera in her bag. She regains control of her life by [[blackmail]]ing Bjurman, after stunning him with a [[taser]], raping him with a [[dildo]], and marking him as a rapist with a [[tattoo]] on his chest and stomach.

Blomkvist's daughter visits him and notes that the numbers from the notebook are bible references. Blomkvist tells Vanger's lieutenant that he needs help with his research, and he recommends Salander based on the great work she did researching Blomkvist himself. Surprised, he hires Salander to further investigate the notebook's content. She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young Jewish women that occurred from 1947 through 1967, causing Blomkvist to mention that the Vangers are known [[antisemitism|antisemites]]. During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers. Henrik's brother Harald ([[Per Myrberg]]) identifies Martin ([[Stellan Skarsg<U+00E5>rd]]), Harriet's brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, as a possible suspect. Blomkvist and Salander continue their research, with Salander uncovering connections between the series of murders, Martin Vanger's father and Martin himself.

Blomkvist breaks into Martin's house to look for more clues, but Martin catches him and prepares to kill him. Martin brags about his crimes, but denies killing Harriet. Salander arrives, subdues Martin and saves Blomkvist. While Salander tends to Blomkvist, Martin flees. Salander, on her motorcycle, pursues Martin in his SUV. He loses control of his vehicle on an icy road and dies when it catches fire. As more secrets are revealed about the Vanger family, Blomkvist deduces that Harriet has been helped by other Vanger family members with a false identity and a move outside Sweden to hide from Martin. Blomkvist confronts Harriet, who describes generations of abuse within the Vanger family and Martin's knowledge of her involvement in her father's death. Finally free of her brother, thanks to Salander and Blomkvist, she returns to Sweden and tearfully reunites with Henrik.

As promised, Henrik gives Blomkvist the information on Wennerstr<U+00F6>m, but it is not helpful. Salander responds by hacking Wennerstr<U+00F6>m's computer and presenting Blomkvist with incriminating information about his activities. This evidence vindicates ''Millennium'' and destroys Wennerstr<U+00F6>m. Salander hacks into Wennerstr<U+00F6>m's bank accounts and transfers two billion [[euros]] to her own secret accounts. During this time, Wennerstr<U+00F6>m is murdered. Salander reveals to her friend, and former guardian, that she has made a connection with Blomkvist. On her way to give Blomkvist a specially chosen Christmas present, Salander sees him and his longtime lover and business partner Erika Berger ([[Robin Wright]]) walking together happily. She discards the gift and rides away.

"I went for something very plain," he explained. "David and I talked about it and we both didn't want an accent to get in the way of the character. Really, many Swedes speak incredibly good English, both with and without accents. I just felt that was the way to go. Blomkvist is well traveled, he's been all over the world, he's been listening to the BBC since he was six and I think this is the person he is." Craig spoke about the film's source material amid the "initial craze"; "It's one of those books you just don't put down. There's just this immediate feeling that bad things are going to happen and I think that's part of why they've been so readable for people."<ref name=filming/>

:The [[Audrey Hepburn]]-esque heroine, as described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Michiko Kakutani]], Salander is a computer hacker who is the victim of mental and sexual abuse. The character was a "vulnerable victim turned vigilante" who possessed the "take-no-prisoners" attitude of [[Lara Croft]] and the "cool, unsentimental intellect" of [[Spock]], according to Kakutani. Fincher felt that Salander's eccentric persona was enthralling. "There's a kind of wish fulfillment to her in the way that she takes care of things, the way she will only put up with so much, but there are other sides to her as well," he professed.<ref name=filming/> Casting was complicated by the raft of prominent candidates such as [[Natalie Portman]], [[Ellen Page]], [[Kristen Stewart]], [[Keira Knightley]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Olivia Thirlby]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], and [[Emma Watson]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Ditzian |first=Eric |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1645813/rooney-mara-lands-lead-girl-with-dragon-tattoo.jhtml |title=Rooney Mara Lands Lead In 'Girl with The Dragon Tattoo' |publisher=[[MTV]] ([[Viacom]]) |date=August 16, 2010 |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Ditzian |first=Eric |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/07/21/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-casting-rumors-sizing-up-our-potential-lisbeth-salander/|title='The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' Casting Rumors: Sizing Up Our Potential Lisbeth Salander|publisher=MTV (Viacom) |date=July 27, 2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2012}}</ref> Despite the hype, some eventually withdrew from consideration due to the time commitment and low pay.<ref name="DailyBeast">{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-08-15/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-who-will-play-her |title=The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: Who Will Play Her? |last=Piccalo |first=Gina |work=[[The Daily Beast]]|publisher=[[The Newsweek Daily Beast Company]] |date=August 15, 2010 |accessdate=December 14, 2010}}</ref> Mara had worked with Fincher in his 2010 film ''[[The Social Network]]''.<ref name=hollzgirl/><ref name=filming/> Fincher found it difficult at first to mold the actress to match Salanders' antisocial demeanor, which was a vast contrast from her earlier role as the submissive Erica.<ref name=hollzgirl/> Mara went through multiple changes in her appearance to become Salander: her hair, for instance, was dyed black and cut into various jagged points, giving the illusion that she cut it herself.<ref name=wmag>{{cite web |last=Hirschberg |first=Lynn |url=http://www.wmagazine.com/celebrities/2011/02/rooney_mara_girl_with_the_dragon_tattoo_film|title=David Fincher Gets The Girl|work=[[W (magazine)|W]]|publisher=[[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications]] |date=February 2011|accessdate=July 1, 2012}}</ref> In addition to her transgressive appearance<U+2014>one that was described as a "mash-up of brazen Seventies punk and spooky Eighties goth with a dash of [[Sadomasochism|S&M]] temptress" by Lynn Hirschberg of ''[[W (magazine)|W]]''<ref name=wmag/><U+2014>the actress participated in a formal screening and was filmed by Fincher on a subway in [[Los Angeles, California]] in an effort to persuade the executives of Sony Pictures that she was a credible choice.<ref name=hollzgirl/>
* [[Yorick van Wageningen]] as Nils Bjurman
:Salander's new legal guardian, Bjurman abuses her to gain control, an atrocity that the character began following a glimpse of her records. Fincher wanted the character to be worse than a typical antagonist, although he didn't want to emulate the stereotypical "mustache-twirling pervert". The director considered van Wageningen to be the embodiment of a versatile actor<U+2014>one that was a "full-fledged human being", a "brilliant" actor. "He was able to bring his performance from a logical place in Bjurman's mind and find the seething morass of darkness inside," Fincher stated. Bjurman's multi-faceted psyche was the main reason van Wageningen wanted to play the role. The Dutch actor said, "This character goes through a lot and I wasn't quite sure I wanted to go through all that. I started out half way between the elation of getting to work with David Fincher and the dread of this character, but I was able to use both of those things. We both thought the most interesting route would be for Bjurman to seem half affable. The challenge was not in finding the freak violence in the guy but finding the humanity of him."<ref name=filming/>
* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Henrik Vanger
:Henrik is an established businessman who launches an extensive investigation into his family's affairs. Despite calling the Vanger family "dysfunctional", Plummer said of the character: "I love the character of the old man, and I sympathize with him. He's really the nicest old guy in the whole book. Everybody is a bit suspect, and still are at the end. Old Vanger has a nice straight line, and he gets his wish."<ref>{{cite web |last=Rocchi |first=James |url=http://social.entertainment.msn.com/movies/blogs/the-hitlist-blogpost.aspx?post=be05b01c-daff-4954-867c-f58f1337226b|title=Interview: Christopher Plummer of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'|publisher=[[MSN]] |date=December 19, 2011|accessdate=July 1, 2012}}</ref> Plummer wanted to imbue the character with [[irony]], an element he found to be absent from the novel's Henrik.<ref name=amm2>{{cite video|date=December 23, 2011|title=The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo - Interview with Christopher Plummer|format=Audio commentary |medium=Dialogue |publisher=[[HitFix]]}}</ref> "I think that the old man would have it," he opined, "because he's a very sophisticated old guy [...] used to a great deal of power.

* [[Stellan Skarsg<U+00E5>rd]] as Martin Vanger
:Martin is the current CEO of the Vanger Corporation. Skarsg<U+00E5>rd was allured by the character's dual nature, and was fascinated that he got to portray him in "two totally different ways".<ref name=amm>{{cite video|date=December 18, 2011|title=The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo - Stellan Skarsg<U+00E5>rd interview|format=Audio commentary |medium=Dialogue |publisher=Black Film}} Note: Event occurs at time 0:45-1:04 and 1:39-1:45.</ref> In regards to Martin's "very complex" and "complicated" personality, the Swedish actor said, "He can be extremely charming but he also can seem to be a completely different person at different points in the film."<ref name=filming/> While consulting with Fincher, the director wanted Skarsg<U+00E5>rd to play Martin without reference to the book.<ref name=amm/>
* [[Joely Richardson]] as Anita Vanger / Harriet Vanger
:In performing her "tricky" character, Richardson recalled that Fincher wanted her to embrace a "darker, edgier" persona, without sugarcoating, and not "resolved or healed". "Even if you were starting to move towards the direction of resolved or healed, he still wanted it edgy and dark. There are no straightforward emotions in the world of this film."<ref name=filming/>

== Production ==
===Conception and writing===
The success of Stieg Larsson's novel created Hollywood interest in adapting the book, as became apparent in 2009, when Lynton and Pascal pursued the idea of developing an "American" version unrelated to the [[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009 film)|film adaptation released that year]]. By December, two major developments occurred for the project: [[Steven Zaillian]], who had recently completed the script for ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]'' (2011), became the screenwriter, while producer [[Scott Rudin]] finalized a partnership allocating full copyrights to Sony.<ref name=hollzgirl/> Zaillian, who was unfamiliar with the novel, got a copy from Rudin. The screenwriter recalled, "They sent it to me and said, 'We want to do this.  We will think of it as one thing for now. It's possible that it can be two and three, but let's concentrate on this one.'"<ref name=collider3>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/steven-zaillian-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-timecrimes-interview/133392/|title=Screenwriter Steven Zaillian Talks THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, Sequels, and How He Might Direct the Remake of TIMECRIMES|first=Steve|last=Weintraub|publisher=Collider|date=December 26, 2011|accessdate=July 1, 2012}}</ref> After reading the book, the screenwriter did no research on the subject.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/2096/steven-zaillian-screenwriting-is-a-lonely-business|title=Steven Zaillian: 'Screenwriting is a lonely business'|last=Jenkins|first=David|work=[[Time Out (company)|Time Out London]]|date=|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}</ref> 
Fincher, who was requested with partner Cean Chaffin by Sony executives to read the novel,<ref name=hollzgirl/><ref>{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Scott |url=http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/04/01/david-fincher-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo |title=David Fincher Inks Deal For 'Dragon Tattoo'|publisher=[[Moviefone]] |date=April 1, 2010 |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}</ref>
was astounded by the series' size and success. As they began to read, the duo noticed that it had a tendency to take "readers on a lot of side trips"<U+2014>"from detailed explanations of surveillance techniques to angry attacks on corrupt Swedish industrialists," professed ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'s}} Gregg Kilday. Fincher recalled of the encounter: "The ballistic, ripping-yarn thriller aspect of it is kind of a red herring in a weird way. It is the thing that throws Salander and Blomkvist together, but it is their relationship you keep coming back to. I was just wondering what 350 pages Zaillian would get rid of." Because Zaillian was already cultivating the screenplay, the director avoided interfering. After a conversation, Fincher was comfortable "they were headed in the same direction".<ref name=hollzgirl/>

{{Quote box|quote=I imagined someone who could move through the streets of Stockholm almost invisibly even though she looks the way she looks <U+2026> it's almost like a forcefield|source={{mdash}}Steven Zaillian<ref name=guard/> |width=32% |bgcolor=#CFECEC |salign=right |align = left}}

The writing process consumed approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel.<ref name=collider3/> Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated. "As soon as you start making decisions," he explained, "you start cutting off all of the other possibilities of things that could happen.  So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do."<ref name=collider3/> Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time.<ref name=collider3/> Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book.<ref name= guard/> To Zaillian, there was always a "low-grade" anxiety, "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," he continued. "I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that out of my mind. I didn't change anything just for the sake of changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, I thought we could do it a different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it."<ref name= guard >{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/dec/17/girl-with-dragon-tattoo-steven-zaillian|title=The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo: Steven Zaillian on the difficulties of adapting Stieg Larsson|first=Alex|last=Godfrey|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=December 16, 2011|accessdate=July 1, 2012}}</ref>

Zaillian discussed many of the themes in Larsson's [[Millennium series|''Millennium'' series]] with Fincher, taking the pair deeper into the novel's darker subjects, such as the psychological dissimilarities between rapists and murders.<ref name= guard/> Fincher was familiar with the concept, from projects such as ''[[Seven (film)|Seven]]'' (1995) and ''[[Zodiac (film)|Zodiac]]'' (2007). Zaillian commented, "A rapist, or at least our rapist, is about exercising his power over somebody. A serial killer is about destruction; they get off on destroying something. It's not about having power over something, it's about eliminating it. What thrills them is slightly different."<ref name= guard/> The duo wanted to expose the novels' pivotal themes, particularly [[misogyny]]. "We were committed to the tack that this is a movie about violence against women about specific kinds of degradation, and you can't shy away from that. But at the same time you have to walk a razor thin line so that the audience can viscerally feel the need for revenge but also see the power of the ideas being expressed."<ref name=filming/> Instead of the typical [[three-act structure]], they reluctantly chose a [[act (drama)#Five-act play|five act structure]], which Fincher pointed out is "very similar to a lot of TV [[cop drama]]s."<ref>{{Cite audio |first =David |last=Fincher |year=2012 |title= The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo |type= DVD commentary track |publisher= [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] |time= 10:30{{nbsp}}to 11:10 |timecaption= From || oclc= 776713480 |quote= |}}</ref>

===Filming===
[[File:Stockholm 8187.jpg|thumb|[[Stockholm, Sweden]] provided for much of the setting of ''The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo''.]]

Fincher and Zaillian's central objective was to maintain the novel's setting. To portray Larsson's vision of Sweden, and the interaction of light on its landscape, Fincher cooperated with an artistic team that included cinematographer [[Jeff Cronenweth]] and production designer [[Donald Graham Burt]]. The film was wholly shot using [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company]]'s RED MX digital camera, chosen to help evoke Larsson's tone. The idea, according to Cronenweth, was to employ unorthodox light sources and maintain a realistic perspective. "So there may be shadows, there may be flaws, but it's reality. You allow silhouettes and darkness, but at the same time we also wanted shots to counter that, so it would not all be one continuous dramatic image."<ref name=filming/> Sweden's climate was a crucial element in enhancing the mood. Cronenweth commented, "It's always an element in the background and it was very important that you feel it as an audience member. The winter becomes like a silent character in the film giving everything a low, cool-colored light that is super soft and non-direct."<ref name=filming/> To get acquainted with Swedish culture, Burt set out on a month-long expedition across the country. He said of the process, "It takes time to start really taking in the nuances of a culture, to start seeing the themes that recur in the architecture, the landscape, the layouts of the cities and the habits of the people. I felt I had to really integrate myself into this world to develop a true sense of place for the film. It was not just about understanding the physicality of the locations, but the metaphysics of them, and how the way people live comes out through design."<ref name=filming/>

====Title sequence====
[[file:GirlTattooHotHands.jpeg|thumb|left|In the "Hot Hands" vignette, the rough, gnarled hands caressing Salander's face serves as a metaphor for the atrocities committed by men.]] 

Tim Miller, creative director for the title sequence, wanted to develop an abstract narrative that reflected the pivotal moments in the novel, as well as the character development of Lisbeth Salander. It was arduous for Miller to conceptualize the sequence abstractly, given that Salander's occupation was a distinctive part of her personality. His initial ideas were modeled after a keyboard. "We were going to treat the keyboard like this giant city with massive fingers pressing down on the keys," Miller explained, "Then we transitioned to the liquid going through the giant obelisks of the keys."<ref name=i0/> Among Miller's many vignettes was "The Hacker Inside", which revealed the character's inner disposition and melted them away. The futuristic qualities in the original designs provided for a much more [[cyberpunk]] appearance than the final product. In creating the "cyber" look for Salander, Miller said, "Every time I would show David a design he would say, 'More Tandy!' It's the shitty little computers from Radio Shack, the Tandy computers. They probably had vacuum tubes in them, really old technology. And David would go 'More Tandy', until we ended up with something that looked like we glued a bunch of computer parts found at a junkyard together."<ref name=i0>{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5873372/an-exclusive-look-at-the-making-of-dragon-tattoos-stunning-titles|title=An Exclusive Look at the Making of Dragon Tattoo<U+2019>s Stunning Titles|first=Meredith|last=Woerner|publisher=[[io9]]|date=January 5, 2012|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}</ref> 

Fincher wanted the vignette to be a "personal nightmare" for Salander, replaying her darkest moments. "Early on, we knew it was supposed to feel like a nightmare," Miller professed, who commented that early on in the process, Fincher wanted to use an artwork as a template for the sequence. After browsing through various paintings to no avail, Fincher chose a painting that depicted the artist, covered in black paint, standing in the middle of a gallery. Many of Miller's sketches contained a liquid-like component, and were rewritten to produce the "gooey" element that was so desired. "David said let's just put liquid in all of them and it will be this primordial dream ooze that's a part of every vignette," Miller recalled. "It ties everything together other than the black on black."<ref name=i0/>

The title sequence includes abundant references to the novel, and exposes several political themes. Salander's tattoos, such as her phoenix and dragon tattoos, were incorporated. The multiple flower representations signified the biological life cycle, as well as Henrik, who received a banquet of flowers each year on his birthday. "One had flowers coming out of this black ooze," said Fincher, "it blossoms, and then it dies. And then a different flower, as that one is dying is rising from the middle of it. It was supposed to represent this cycle of the killer sending flowers."<ref name=i0/> Ultimately, the vignette becomes very conceptual because Miller and his team took "a whole thought, and cut it up into multiple different shots that are mixed in with other shots". In one instance, Blomkvist is strangled by strips of newspaper, a metaphor for the establishment squelching his exposes.<ref name=i0/>

In the "Hot Hands" vignette, the nefarious actions of men are symbolized as a pair of rough, distorted hands that embrace Salander's face, melting it. These hands, according to Miller, are a metaphor for wealth and power. "They're rich people hands, and with her it's the hands of bad men," Miller avouched.<ref name=i0/> Themes of [[domestic violence]] become apparent as a woman's face shatters after a merciless beating; this also ties in the brutal beating of Salander's mother by her father, an event revealed in the sequel, ''[[The Girl Who Played with Fire]]'' (2006).<ref name=i0/>

A cover of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Immigrant Song]]" (1970) plays throughout the title sequence. The rendition was produced by soundtrack composers [[Atticus Ross]] and [[Nine Inch Nails]] member [[Trent Reznor]], and features vocals from [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]] lead singer [[Karen O]].<ref>{{Cite web |first=Annlee |last=Ellingson |date=December 15, 2011 |title=The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo |publisher=[[Wolfgang's Vault]]| work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2011/12/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo.html |accessdate=December 22, 2011 }}</ref> Fincher suggested the song, but Reznor agreed only at his request.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Annlee |last=Ellingson |date=December 14, 2011 |title=Trent Reznor: Darkness Audible |work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/girl-dragon-tattoo-trent-reznor-david-fincher-273062 |accessdate=December 22, 2011 }}</ref> Led Zeppelin licensed the song only for use in the film's trailer and title sequence.

Even before viewing the script, Reznor and Ross opted to utilize a redolent approach to creating the film's score. After discussing with Fincher the varying soundscapes and emotions, the duo spent six weeks composing. "We composed music we felt might belong," stated the Nine Inch Nails lead vocalist, "and then we'd run it by Fincher, to see where his head<U+2019>s at and he responded positively. He was filming at this time last year and assembling rough edits of scenes to see what it feels like, and he was inserting our music at that point, rather than using temp music, which is how it usually takes place, apparently." Finding a structure for the soundtrack was arguably the most strenuous task. "We weren<U+2019>t working on a finished thing, so everything keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and that can get pretty frustrating when you get precious about your work. It was a lesson we learned pretty quickly of, 'Everything is in flux, and approach it as such. Hopefully it<U+2019>ll work out in the end.'"<ref name=filmstage/>

=== Accolades ===
