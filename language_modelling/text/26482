'''Computer graphics''' are [[graphics]] created using [[computer]]s and, more generally, the representation and manipulation of [[image]] data by a computer with help from specialized [[graphics software|software]] and [[graphics hardware|hardware]].

The development of computer graphics has made computers easier to interact with, and better for understanding and interpreting many types of data. Developments in computer graphics have had a profound impact on many types of media and have revolutionized [[animation]], [[movies]] and the [[video game]] industry.

== Overview ==
The term computer graphics has been used in a broad sense to describe "almost everything on computers that is not text or sound".<ref>[http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/online/tutorial/ What is Computer Graphics?],
Cornell University Program of Computer Graphics. Last updated 04/15/98. Accessed November 17, 2009.</ref> Typically, the term ''computer graphics'' refers to several different things:
* the representation and manipulation of image data by a computer
* the various [[technologies]] used to create and manipulate images
* the sub-field of [[computer science]] which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content, see [[Computer graphics (computer science)|study of computer graphics]]

Computer graphics is widespread today. Computer imagery is found on television, in newspapers, for example in weather reports, or for example in all kinds of medical investigation and surgical procedures. A well-constructed [[Chart|graph]] can present complex statistics in a form that is easier to understand and interpret. In the media "such graphs are used to illustrate papers, reports, thesis", and other presentation material.<ref name="ISS02">University of Leeds ISS (2002). [http://iss.leeds.ac.uk/info/306/graphics/215/overview_of_computer_graphics/2 "What are computer graphics?"]. Last updated: 22 September 2008</ref>

Many powerful tools have been developed to visualize data. Computer generated imagery can be categorized into several different types: 2D, 3D, and animated graphics. As technology has improved, 3D computer graphics have become more common, but 2D computer graphics are still widely used. Computer graphics has emerged as a sub-field of [[computer science]] which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content. Over the past decade, other specialized fields have been developed like [[information visualization]], and [[scientific visualization]] more concerned with "the visualization of [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensional]] phenomena (architectural, meteorological, medical, [[Biological Data Visualization|biological]], etc.), where the emphasis is on realistic renderings of volumes, surfaces, illumination sources, and so forth, perhaps with a dynamic (time) component".<ref name = "MF08">[[Michael Friendly]] (2008). [http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone/milestone.pdf "Milestones in the history of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization"].</ref>

== History ==
[[Image:SAGE control room.png|thumb|right|[[SAGE Project|SAGE]] Sector Control Room.]]
The phrase <U+201C>Computer Graphics<U+201D> was coined in 1960 by [[William Fetter]], a graphic designer for [[Boeing]].<ref name= "WC03">Wayne Carlson (2003) [http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/lessons.html A Critical History of Computer Graphics and Animation]. The Ohio State University</ref>  The field of computer graphics developed with the emergence of computer graphics hardware. Early projects like the [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]] and [[SAGE Project]]s introduced the [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] as a viable [[visual display unit|display]] and interaction interface and introduced the [[light pen]] as an [[input device]].

=== Initial 1960s developments ===
Further advances in computing led to greater advancements in interactive computer graphics. In 1959, the [[TX-2]] computer was developed at [[Lincoln Laboratory|MIT's Lincoln Laboratory]]. The TX-2 integrated a number of new man-machine interfaces. A light pen could be used to draw sketches on the computer using [[Ivan Sutherland]]'s revolutionary [[Sketchpad|Sketchpad software]].<ref name= "WC03"/> Using a light pen, Sketchpad allowed one to draw simple shapes on the computer screen, save them and even recall them later. The light pen itself had a small photoelectric cell in its tip. This cell emitted an electronic pulse whenever it was placed in front of a computer screen and the screen's electron gun fired directly at it. By simply timing the electronic pulse with the current location of the electron gun, it was easy to pinpoint exactly where the pen was on the screen at any given moment. Once that was determined, the computer could then draw a cursor at that location.

Sutherland seemed to find the perfect solution for many of the graphics problems he faced. Even today, many standards of computer graphics interfaces got their start with this early Sketchpad program. One example of this is in drawing constraints. If one wants to draw a square for example, they do not have to worry about drawing four lines perfectly to form the edges of the box. One can simply specify that they want to draw a box, and then specify the location and size of the box. The software will then construct a perfect box, with the right dimensions and at the right location. Another example is that Sutherland's software modeled objects - not just a picture of objects. In other words, with a model of a car, one could change the size of the tires without affecting the rest of the car. It could stretch the body of the car without deforming the tires.

=== Further 1961 developments ===
[[File:Spacewar!-PDP-1-20070512.jpg|thumb|Spacewar! running on the Computer History Museum's [[PDP-1]].]]
Also in 1961 another student at MIT, [[Steve Russell]], created the first video game, [[Spacewar!|Spacewar]]. Written for the DEC [[PDP-1]], Spacewar was an instant success and copies started flowing to other PDP-1 owners and eventually even DEC got a copy. The engineers at [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] used it as a diagnostic program on every new PDP-1 before shipping it. The sales force picked up on this quickly enough and when installing new units, would run the world's first video game for their new customers.

E. E. Zajac, a scientist at [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratory]] (BTL), created a film called "Simulation of a two-giro gravity attitude control system" in 1963.<ref>David Salomon (1999). ''Computer graphics and geometric modeling''. p. ix</ref> In this computer generated film, Zajac showed how the attitude of a satellite could be altered as it orbits the Earth. He created the animation on an [[IBM 7090]] mainframe computer. Also at BTL, [[Ken Knowlton]], [[Frank Sindon]] and [[Michael Noll]] started working in the computer graphics field. Sindon created a film called Force, Mass and Motion illustrating Newton's laws of motion in operation. Around the same time, other scientists were creating computer graphics to illustrate their research. At Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, Nelson Max created the films, "Flow of a Viscous Fluid" and "Propagation of Shock Waves in a Solid Form." Boeing Aircraft created a film called "Vibration of an Aircraft."

It was not long before major corporations started taking an interest in computer graphics. [[TRW]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed-Georgia]], [[General Electric]] and [[Sperry Rand]] are among the many companies that were getting started in computer graphics by the mid-1960s. IBM was quick to respond to this interest by releasing the IBM 2250 graphics terminal, the first commercially available graphics computer.
[[Image:Pong.png|thumb|right|170px|''[[Pong]]'' arcade version]]
[[Ralph Baer]], a supervising engineer at Sanders Associates, came up with a home [[video game]] in 1966 that was later licensed to [[Magnavox]] and called the [[Magnavox Odyssey|Odyssey]]. While very simplistic, and requiring fairly inexpensive electronic parts, it allowed the player to move points of light around on a screen. It was the first consumer computer graphics product.

[[David C. Evans]] was director of engineering at [[Bendix Corporation]]'s computer division from 1953 to 1962, after which he worked for the next five years as a visiting professor at Berkeley. There he continued his interest in computers and how they interfaced with people. In 1966, the University of Utah recruited Evans to form a computer science program, and computer graphics quickly became his primary interest. This new department would become the world's primary research center for computer graphics.

Also in 1966, Sutherland at MIT invented the first computer controlled [[head-mounted display]] (HMD). Called the Sword of Damocles because of the hardware required for support, it displayed two separate wireframe images, one for each eye. This allowed the viewer to see the computer scene in stereoscopic 3D. After receiving his Ph.D. from MIT, Sutherland became Director of Information Processing at [[DARPA|ARPA]] (Advanced Research Projects Agency), and later became a professor at Harvard.

In 1967 Sutherland was recruited by Evans to join the computer science program at the University of Utah. There he perfected his HMD. Twenty years later, NASA would re-discover his techniques in their virtual reality research. At Utah, Sutherland and Evans were highly sought after consultants by large companies but they were frustrated at the lack of graphics hardware available at the time so they started formulating a plan to start their own company.

In 1969, the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] initiated A Special Interest Group in Graphics ([[SIGGRAPH]]) which organizes [[List of computer science conferences#Computer graphics|conferences]], graphics standards, and publications within the field of computer graphics. In 1973, the first annual SIGGRAPH conference was held, which has become one of the focuses of the organization. SIGGRAPH has grown in size and importance as the field of computer graphics has expanded over time.

=== 1970s ===
Many of the most important early breakthroughs in computer graphics research occurred at the [[University of Utah]] in the 1970s. A student by the name of [[Edwin Catmull]] started at the University of Utah in 1970 and signed up for [[Ivan Sutherland|Sutherland]]'s computer graphics class. Catmull had just come from The Boeing Company and had been working on his degree in physics. Growing up on Disney, Catmull loved animation yet quickly discovered that he did not have the talent for drawing. Now Catmull (along with many others) saw computers as the natural progression of animation and they wanted to be part of the revolution. The first animation that Catmull saw was his own. He created an animation of his hand opening and closing. It became one of his goals to produce a feature length motion picture using computer graphics. In the same class, [[Fred Parke]] created an animation of his wife's face. Because of Evan's and Sutherland's presence, UU was gaining quite a reputation as the place to be for computer graphics research so Catmull went there to learn 3D animation.

As the UU computer graphics laboratory was attracting people from all over, [[John Warnock]] was one of those early pioneers; he would later found [[Adobe Systems]] and create a revolution in the publishing world with his [[PostScript]] page description language. Tom Stockham led the image processing group at UU which worked closely with the computer graphics lab. Jim Clark was also there; he would later found Silicon Graphics, Inc.

The first major advance in 3D computer graphics was created at UU by these early pioneers, the hidden-surface algorithm. In order to draw a representation of a 3D object on the screen, the computer must determine which surfaces are "behind" the object from the viewer's perspective, and thus should be "hidden" when the computer creates (or renders) the image.

The [[3D Core Graphics System]] (or '''Core''') was the first graphical standard to be developed.  A group of 25 experts of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Special Interest Group]] [[SIGGRAPH]] developed this "conceptual framework".  The specifications were published in 1977, and it became a foundation for many future development in the field.

=== 1980s ===
In the early 1980s, the availability of bit-slice and 16-bit microprocessors started to revolutionise high resolution computer graphics terminals which now increasingly became intelligent, semi-standalone and standalone workstations. Graphics and application processing were increasingly migrated to the intelligence in the workstation, rather than continuing to rely on central mainframe and mini-computers. Typical of the early move to high resolution computer graphics intelligent workstations for the computer-aided engineering market were the Orca 1000, 2000 and 3000 workstations, developed by Orcatech of Ottawa, a spin-off from [[Bell-Northern Research]], and led by an early workstation pioneer [[David John Pearson]]. The Orca 3000 was based on Motorola 68000 and AMD bit-slice processors and had Unix as its operating system. It was targeted squarely at the sophisticated end of the design engineering sector. Artists and graphic designers began to see the personal computer, particularly the [[Commodore Amiga]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], as a serious design tool, one that could save time and draw more accurately than other methods. In the late 1980s, [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] computers were used to create some of the first fully computer-generated [[short film]]s at [[Pixar]]. The Macintosh remains a highly popular tool for computer graphics among graphic design studios and businesses. Modern computers, dating from the 1980s often use [[graphical user interfaces]] (GUI) to present data and information with symbols, icons and pictures, rather than text. Graphics are one of the five key elements of [[multimedia]] technology.

=== 1990s ===
[[3D graphics]] became more popular in the 1990s in [[Video game|gaming]], [[multimedia]] and [[animation]]. At the end of the 80s and beginning of the nineties were created, in France, the very first computer graphics TV series: "La Vie des b<U+00EA>tes" by studio Mac Guff Ligne (1988), ''Les Fables G<U+00E9>om<U+00E9>triques'' J.-Y. Grall, Georges Lacroix and Renato (studio Fantome, 1990<U+2013>1993) and ''[[Quarxs]]'', the first  HDTV computer graphics series by [[Maurice Benayoun]] and [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Schuiten]] (studio Z-A production, 1991<U+2013>1993). In 1995, [[Toy Story]], the first full-length computer-generated animation film, was released in cinemas worldwide. In 1996, [[Quake (video game)|Quake]], one of the first fully 3D [[game]]s, was released. Since then, computer graphics have only become more detailed and realistic, due to more powerful graphics hardware and 3D modeling software.

== Image types ==
=== Two-dimensional ===
[[Image:Blit dot.gif|thumb|[[Raster graphics|Raster graphic]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s (left) and masks (right)]]
[[2D computer graphics]] are the computer-based generation of [[digital image]]s&mdash;mostly from two-dimensional models, such as [[2D geometric model]]s, text, and digital images, and by techniques specific to them.

2D computer graphics are mainly used in applications that were originally developed upon traditional [[printing]] and [[drawing]] technologies, such as  [[typography]], [[cartography]], [[technical drawing]], [[advertising]], etc.. In those applications, the two-dimensional [[image]] is not just a representation of a real-world object, but an independent artifact with added semantic value; two-dimensional models are therefore preferred, because they give more direct control of the image than [[3D computer graphics]], whose approach is more akin to [[photography]] than to [[typography]].

==== Pixel art ====
[[Pixel art]] is a form of [[digital art]], created through the use of [[raster graphics]] [[software]], where images are edited on the [[pixel]] level. Graphics in most old (or relatively limited) computer and video games, [[graphing calculator]] games, and many [[mobile phone]] games are mostly pixel art.

==== Vector graphics ====
[[Image:VectorBitmapExample.png|thumb|Example showing effect of vector graphics versus raster (bitmap) graphics.]]
[[Vector graphics]] formats are complementary to [[raster graphics]]. Raster graphics is the representation of images as an array of [[pixel]]s and is typically used for the representation of photographic images. <ref>{{cite book | title = Processing: Creative Coding and Computational Art | author = Ira Greenberg | publisher = Apress | year = 2007 | isbn = 1-59059-617-X | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=WTl_7H5HUZAC&pg=PA115&dq=raster+vector+graphics+photographic&lr=&as_brr=0&ei=llOVR5LKCJL0iwGZ8-ywBw&sig=YEjfPOYSUDIf1CUbL5S5Jbzs7M8 }}</ref> Vector graphics consists in encoding information about shapes and colors that comprise the image, which can allow for more flexibility in rendering. There are instances when working with vector tools and formats is best practice, and instances when working with raster tools and formats is best practice. There are times when both formats come together. An understanding of the advantages and limitations of each technology and the relationship between them is most likely to result in efficient and effective use of tools.

=== Three-dimensional ===
[[3D computer graphics]] in contrast to [[2D computer graphics]] are graphics that use a [[Cartesian coordinate system#Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions|three-dimensional]] representation of geometric data that is stored in the computer for the purposes of performing calculations and rendering 2D images. Such images may be for later display or for real-time viewing.

Despite these differences, 3D computer graphics rely on many of the same [[algorithm]]s as 2D computer [[vector graphics]] in the [[wire frame model]] and 2D computer [[raster graphics]] in the final rendered display. In computer graphics software, the distinction between 2D and 3D is occasionally blurred; 2D applications may use 3D techniques to achieve effects such as lighting, and primarily 3D may use 2D rendering techniques.

3D computer graphics are often referred to as [[3D models]]. Apart from the rendered graphic, the model is contained within the graphical data file. However, there are differences. A 3D model is the [[Mathematics|mathematical]] representation of any [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] object. A model is not technically a graphic until it is visually displayed. Due to [[3D printing]], 3D models are not confined to virtual space. A model can be displayed visually as a two-dimensional image through a process called ''[[3D rendering]],'' or used in non-graphical [[computer simulation]]s and calculations. There are some [[3D computer graphics software]] for users to create 3D images.

=== Computer animation ===
[[image:Activemarker2.PNG|right|thumb|Example of [[Computer animation]] produced using [[Motion capture]]]]
[[File:FractalLandscape.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fractal landscape]], an example of [[computer-generated imagery]]. .]]
[[Computer animation]] is the art of creating moving images via the use of [[computer]]s. It is a subfield of computer graphics and [[animation]]. Increasingly it is created by means of [[3D computer graphics]], though [[2D computer graphics]] are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time rendering needs. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another [[Recording medium|medium]], such as [[film]]. It is also referred to as CGI ([[Computer-generated imagery]] or computer-generated imaging), especially when used in films.

Virtual entities may contain and be controlled by assorted attributes, such as transform values (location, orientation, and scale) stored in an object's [[transformation matrix]]. Animation is the change of an attribute over time. Multiple methods of achieving animation exist; the rudimentary form is based on the creation and editing of [[keyframe]]s, each storing a value at a given time, per attribute to be animated. The 2D/3D graphics software will [[interpolation|interpolate]] between keyframes, creating an editable curve of a value mapped over time, resulting in animation. Other methods of animation include [[procedural animation|procedural]] and [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]]-based techniques: the former consolidates related elements of animated entities into sets of attributes, useful for creating [[particle system|particle]] effects and [[crowd simulation]]s; the latter allows an evaluated result returned from a user-defined logical expression, coupled with mathematics, to automate animation in a predictable way (convenient for controlling bone behavior beyond what a [[hierarchy]] offers in [[skeletal animation|skeletal system]] set up).

To create the illusion of movement, an image is displayed on the computer [[computer display|screen]] then quickly replaced by a new image that is similar to the previous image, but shifted slightly. This technique is identical to the illusion of movement in [[television]] and [[film|motion pictures]].

== Concepts and principles ==
Images are typically produced by [[optics|optical]] devices;such as [[camera]]s, [[mirror]]s, [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s, etc. and natural objects and phenomena, such as the [[human eye]] or water surfaces.

A [[digital image]] is a representation of a two-dimensional [[image]] in binary format as a sequence of ones and zeros. Digital images include both [[vector graphics|vector]] images and [[raster graphics|raster]] images, but raster images are more commonly used.

=== Pixel ===
[[Image:Pixel-example.png|thumb|right|In the enlarged portion of the image individual pixels are rendered as squares and can be easily seen.]]
In digital imaging, a [[pixel]] (or picture element<ref>{{Cite book
  | author=Rudolf F. Graf | year=1999 | publisher=Newnes

  -->sig=7tg-LuGdu6Njypaawi2bbkeq8pw}}</ref>) is a single point in a [[raster image]]. Pixels are normally arranged in a regular 2-dimensional grid, and are often represented using dots or squares. Each pixel is a [[sample (signal)|sample]] of an original image, where more samples typically provide a more accurate representation of the original. The [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] of each pixel is variable; in color systems, each pixel has typically three
components such as [[RGB color model|red, green, and blue]].

=== Graphics ===
[[Graphics]] are [[visual]] presentations on some surface, such as a wall, [[canvas]], computer screen, paper, or stone to [[brand]], inform, illustrate, or entertain. Examples are [[photograph]]s, [[drawings]], [[line art]], [[graphics|graphs]], [[diagrams]], [[typography]], [[number]]s, [[symbols]], [[geometric]] designs, [[maps]], [[engineering drawings]], or other [[image]]s. Graphics often combine [[character (computer)|text]], [[illustration]], and [[color]]. Graphic design may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flier, poster, web site, or book without any other element. Clarity or effective communication may be the objective, association with other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, the creation of a distinctive style.

=== Rendering ===
Rendering is the process of generating an image from a [[3D model|model]] (or models in what collectively could be called a ''scene'' file), by means of computer programs. A scene file contains objects in a strictly defined language or data structure; it would contain geometry, viewpoint, [[texture mapping|texture]], [[lighting]], and [[shading]] information as a description of the virtual scene. The data contained in the scene file is then passed to a rendering program to be processed and output to a [[digital image]] or [[raster graphics]] image file. The rendering program is usually built into the computer graphics software, though others are available as plug-ins or entirely separate programs. The term "rendering" may be by analogy with an "artist's rendering" of a scene. Though the technical details of rendering methods vary, the general challenges to overcome in producing a 2D image from a 3D representation stored in a scene file are outlined as the [[graphics pipeline]] along a rendering device, such as a [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]. A GPU is a purpose-built device able to assist a [[Central processing unit|CPU]] in performing complex rendering calculations. If a scene is to look relatively realistic and predictable under virtual lighting, the rendering software should solve the [[rendering equation]]. The rendering equation does not account for all lighting phenomena, but is a general lighting model for computer-generated imagery. 'Rendering' is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in a video editing file to produce final video output.

;3D projection
:[[3D projection]] is a method of mapping three dimensional points to a two dimensional plane. As most current methods for displaying graphical data are based on planar two dimensional media, the use of this type of projection is widespread, especially in computer graphics, engineering and drafting.

;Ray tracing
:[[Ray tracing (graphics)|Ray tracing]] is a technique for generating an [[digital image|image]] by tracing the path of [[light]] through [[pixel]]s in an [[image plane]]. The technique is capable of producing a very high degree of [[photorealism]]; usually higher than that of typical [[scanline rendering]] methods, but at a greater [[computation time|computational cost]].

;Shading
[[Image:Shading1.jpg|thumb|right|Example of shading.]]
:[[Shading]] refers to [[wikt:depicting|depicting]] depth in [[3D model]]s or illustrations by varying levels of [[darkness]]. It is a process used in drawing for depicting levels of darkness on paper by applying media more densely or with a darker shade for darker areas, and less densely or with a lighter shade for lighter areas. There are various techniques of shading including [[Hatching|cross hatching]] where perpendicular lines of varying closeness are drawn in a grid pattern to shade an area. The closer the lines are together, the darker the area appears. Likewise, the farther apart the lines are, the lighter the area appears. The term has been recently generalized to mean that [[shader]]s are applied.

;Texture mapping
:[[Texture mapping]] is a method for adding detail, surface texture, or colour to a [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated graphic]] or [[3D model]]. Its application to 3D graphics was pioneered by Dr [[Edwin Catmull]] in 1974. A texture map is applied (mapped) to the surface of a shape, or polygon. This process is akin to applying patterned paper to a plain white box. Multitexturing is the use of more than one texture at a time on a polygon.<ref>Blythe, David. ''[http://www.opengl.org/resources/code/samples/sig99/advanced99/notes/notes.html Advanced Graphics Programming Techniques Using OpenGL].'' Siggraph 1999. (see: [http://www.opengl.org/resources/code/samples/sig99/advanced99/notes/node60.html Multitexture])</ref> [[Procedural texture]]s (created from adjusting parameters of an underlying algorithm that produces an output texture), and [[bitmap|bitmap textures]] (created in an [[image editing]] application or imported from a [[digital camera]]) are, generally speaking, common methods of implementing texture definition on 3D models in computer graphics software, while intended placement of textures onto a model's surface often requires a technique known as [[UV mapping]] (arbitrary, manual layout of texture coordinates) for [[polygon mesh|polygon surfaces]], while [[NURBS|NURBS surfaces]] have their own intrinsic [[parameterization]] used as texture coordinates.

;Anti-aliasing
:Rendering resolution-independent entities (such as 3D models) for viewing on a raster (pixel-based) device such as a [[Lcd|LCD display]] or [[Cathode ray tube|CRT television]] inevitably causes [[aliasing|aliasing artifacts]] mostly along geometric edges and the boundaries of texture details; these artifacts are informally called "[[jaggies]]". Anti-aliasing methods rectify such problems, resulting in imagery more pleasing to the viewer, but can be somewhat computationally expensive. Various anti-aliasing algorithms (such as [[supersampling]]) are able to be employed, then customized for the most efficient rendering performance versus quality of the resultant imagery; a graphics artist should consider this trade-off if anti-aliasing methods are to be used. A pre-anti-aliased [[bitmap|bitmap texture]] being displayed on a screen (or screen location) at a resolution different than the resolution of the texture itself (such as a textured model in the distance from the virtual camera) will exhibit aliasing artifacts, while any [[Procedural texture|procedurally defined texture]] will always show aliasing artifacts as they are resolution-independent; techniques such as [[mipmapping]] and [[texture filtering]] help to solve texture-related aliasing problems.

=== Volume rendering ===
[[Image:CTWristImage.png|thumb|Volume rendered [[Computed tomography|CT]] scan of a forearm with different colour schemes for muscle, fat, bone, and blood.]]
[[Volume rendering]] is a technique used to display a [[3D projection|2D projection]] of a 3D discretely [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] [[data set]]. A typical 3D data set is a group of 2D slice images acquired by a [[computed axial tomography|CT]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scanner.

Usually these are acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image [[pixel]]s in a regular pattern. This is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or [[voxel]] represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel.

=== 3D modeling ===
[[3D modeling]] is the process of developing a mathematical, [[wire frame model|wireframe]] representation of any three-dimensional object, called a "3D model", via specialized software. Models may be created automatically or manually; the manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to [[plastic arts]] such as [[sculpting]]. 3D models may be created using multiple approaches: use of [[Nonuniform rational B-spline|NURBS]] curves to generate accurate and smooth surface patches, [[Polygonal modeling|polygonal mesh modeling]] (manipulation of faceted geometry), or polygonal mesh [[Subdivision surface|subdivision]] (advanced tessellation of polygons, resulting in smooth surfaces similar to NURBS models). A 3D model can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called ''[[3D rendering]]'', used in a [[computer]] [[simulation]] of physical phenomena, or animated directly for other purposes. The model can also be physically created using [[3D Printing]] devices.

== Study of computer graphics ==
The [[Computer graphics (computer science)|study of computer graphics]] is a sub-field of [[computer science]] which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content. Although the term often refers to three-dimensional computer graphics, it also encompasses two-dimensional graphics and [[image processing]].

As an [[academic]] discipline, computer graphics studies the manipulation of visual and geometric information using computational techniques. It focuses on the ''mathematical'' and ''computational'' foundations of image generation and processing rather than purely [[aesthetic]] issues. Computer graphics is often differentiated from the field of [[visualization (graphic)|visualization]], although the two fields have many similarities.

== Applications ==
