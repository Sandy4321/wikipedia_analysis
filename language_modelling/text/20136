[[First Spouse of the Philippines|First Lady]] '''Imelda Marcos''', {{Post-nominals|post-noms= [[Philippine Legion of Honor|PLH]]}} (born July 2, 1929) is the widow of [[Philippines|Philippine]] [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and  forms half of their so-called conjugal dictatorship. She is remembered as an imeldific symbol of  extravagance during her and her husband's 20-year rule due to her collection of more than a thousand pairs of [[shoes]].

Imelda held positions in government that allowed her to travel the world and accumulate artwork and property. The couple consolidated their power allowing them to transport funds from the [[Economy of the Philippines|Philippine treasury]] into [[offshore account]]s, such as those in [[bank]]s in [[Switzerland]]. Her husband and their family was forced out of office as a result of the [[People Power Revolution]] but was later given [[amnesty]] after her husband's death. After an exile in [[Hawaii]], she was elected in the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] in 1996 for [[Leyte province|Leyte]] and again in 2010 for [[Ilocos Norte]].

Despite facing numerous cases involving alleged corruption, she has yet to be imprisoned and she continues to wield power. She remains one of the most [[enigma]]tic figures of both the [[20th century|20th]] and [[21st century|21st centuries]]. Her qualities of [[divine grace|grace]] and [[beauty]] along with her ability to survive upheavals has led her to be called the "[[Iron Lady|Iron Butterfly]]".

Imelda was also appointed as Ambassador Plenipotentiary and Extraordinary and she toured numerous countries, most notably the [[United States]], [[China]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Libya]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Iraq]], and [[Cuba]].

Imelda was instrumental in the 1980 exile in the [[United States]] of opposition leader [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]], who had suffered a heart attack during his imprisonment. [[Martial Law in the Philippines|Martial Law]] was later lifted in 1981 and her husband, Ferdinand, was again elected president in what was believed to be [[sham election]]s.<ref>''The Marcos Dynasty'', Sterling Seagrave, author, Harper & Row, New York, 1988, ISBN 0-06-015815-8</ref> Unfortunately, her husband began to suffer from [[lupus erythematosus]] so Imelda effectively ruled in his place.

In 1998, Imelda would again seek the presidency. She ran [[Philippine presidential election, 1998|presidential elections of that year]] but later withdrew to support the eventual winner [[Joseph Estrada]]. She finished 9th among 11 candidates.
