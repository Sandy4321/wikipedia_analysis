[[Image:ENlogoEN.gif|thumb|Europa Nostra Logo]]'''Europa Nostra''', the pan-European Federation for [[cultural heritage|Cultural Heritage]], is the representative platform of 250 heritage [[NGO]]s active in 45 countries across [[Europe]]. It is the voice of this vast movement of European [[civil society]] active in the field of heritage towards international bodies concerned, in particular the [[European Union]] Institutions, the [[Council of Europe]] and [[UNESCO]].

Europa Nostra is dedicated to putting heritage and its benefits in the mainstream of public consciousness and to making heritage a priority for public policies both at European and national levels. Its specific objectives are to promote, at a European level, high standards of quality in the fields of heritage conservation, architecture, urban and rural planning and to advocate a balanced and sustainable development of urban and rural, built and natural environment. 

Europa Nostra supports national and international campaigns for the preservation and rescue of Europe<U+2019>s heritage at risk. It encourages exemplary initiatives in favour of the conservation and enhancement of cultural heritage by recognising outstanding heritage achievements, in particular through the running of the '''European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Awards''', in partnership with the [[European Commission]]. In early 2006, Europa Nostra was selected as the new Liaison Office for the coordination of the '''[[European Heritage Days]]''', a joint action of the Council of Europe and the European Commission.

Europa Nostra was founded in [[1963]], upon the initiative of [[Italia Nostra]], as a response to the serious threat to the survival of [[Venice]], caused by the regular floods. In 1991 it merged with the ''Internationales Burgen Institut'' (the International Castles Institute). Today, through its various activities, Europa Nostra seeks to highlight the importance of cultural heritage as a building block of European identity and as a contribution to the strengthening of the sense of European citizenship.

Europa Nostra is presided over by [[Infanta Pilar, Duchess of Badajoz|HRH the Infanta Do<U+00F1>a Pilar de Borb<U+00F3>n]], who in 2007 succeeded [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|HRH the Prince Consort of Denmark]]. Its activities are coordinated by an International Secretariat based in [[The Hague]] ([[Netherlands]]). In several countries, the International Secretariat is assisted in its tasks by national representations.

[[Image:ENwindturbines.gif|thumb|Wind Turbines]]Acting as a true European cultural heritage lobby, Europa Nostra advocates the need to take cultural heritage concerns into consideration when formulating and implementing all European and national policies which have an impact on heritage. It also seeks to highlight the importance and the specific character of cultural heritage within the wider cultural and policy agenda of important international partners: namely the [[Council of Europe]], the [[European Union]] and [[UNESCO]].

* Cultural heritage and education in a European perspective

== Exchanging Ideas and Experiences ==
Europa Nostra serves as a platform for European [[civil society]] active in the field of heritage and for exchanging ideas and experiences. It organises International  Congresses and Forums on various heritage subjects that are of relevance to the whole of [[Europe]], and also smaller-scale national, regional and local meetings with heritage [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] in different parts of Europe.
