'''Matthew Cowley''' (August 2, 1897 <U+2013> December 13, 1953) was an American missionary and a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] from 1945 until his death. He was affectionately known as the "Polynesian Apostle" because of his intimate knowledge of [[Polynesian culture]] and the [[M<U+0101>ori language]].

==Early life==
Matthew Cowley was the son of [[Matthias F. Cowley]] and Abbie Hyde. After his birth, in the same year, his father was called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and they moved from [[Preston, Idaho|Preston]], [[Idaho]] to [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]. When Matthew was eight years of age, his father resigned from the quorum over the church's decision to [[Second Manifesto|excommunicate practitioners]] of [[plural marriage]]. In 1911, when Matthew was 14, his father was disciplined and had his priesthood temporarily rescinded. This did not stop Matthew from growing strong in the church.

He attended Latter-day Saints University in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] until his call as a missionary.

==Missionary==
In 1914, Cowley was called to serve as a [[Mormon missionary|missionary]] in [[New Zealand]]. There he developed an unusual talent with the [[M<U+0101>ori language]] and [[M<U+0101>ori|people]]. He was called upon to revise the translation of the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'' in that language; this revised edition appeared in 1917. He was also called to translate the ''[[Doctrine and Covenants]]'' and the ''[[Pearl of Great Price (Latter Day Saints)|Pearl of Great Price]]'' into M<U+0101>ori, with the assistance of Wiremu Duncan and Stuart Meha. The translated version of these sacred texts appeared in 1919. His mission was extended two years beyond the typical three to complete these tasks.

After returning from his mission, Cowley attended [[George Washington University Law School]] in [[Washington D.C.]]. Upon graduating, he worked for a short period under Senator [[Reed Smoot (U. S. Senator)|Reed Smoot]]. Afterwards, Cowley started his own law practice in Salt Lake City. He married Elva Eleanor Taylor in the [[Salt Lake Temple]] on July 13, 1922. They had one daughter.

In 1938, he was called to serve as the [[Mission president|president]] over the LDS Church's New Zealand [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]]. As [[World War II]] began, the church called the missionaries serving overseas back home to the [[United States]]. Cowley remained in New Zealand throughout the war. During his service, he adopted a M<U+0101>ori boy. He was known by both members and non-members alike for his dedication to the M<U+0101>ori people.

==Apostle==
Cowley was released from his mission presidency in September 1945, and that October, in [[General conference (Latter Day Saints)|general conference]], he was called to serve as an [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, filling the vacancy caused by the passing of [[President of the Church|church president]] [[Heber J. Grant]]. He was ordained on October 11, 1945 by new church president [[George Albert Smith]].

Cowley was affectionately known as the "Polynesian Apostle." He was also known for being exceptionally compassionate. He encouraged the members of the church to openly welcome sinners rather than ostracize them. He was also known for being an eloquent speaker and writer. A number of his sermons were compiled into ''Matthew Cowley Speaks'', which was published after his passing.

His contributions to the M<U+0101>ori and the church in New Zealand continued during his service as an apostle. As an apostle, he presided over all of the missions of the church in the Pacific. He played a crucial role in the building of the [[Hamilton New Zealand Temple]] and also worked in constructing a church school near the temple site.

Cowley died suddenly in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. He is interred in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. [[George Q. Morris]] was called to fill the void in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
