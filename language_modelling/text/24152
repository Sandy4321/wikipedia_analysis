'''Jeremiah Collins''' was played by [[Anthony George]] during the [[1795]] [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]] on the [[ABC-TV]] cult television [[gothic horror]] [[soap opera]] serial [[Dark Shadows]]. 

The character of Jeremiah Collins was born in [[1763]], and was the younger brother of Joshua Collins ([[Louis Edmonds]]), sister of [[Abigail Collins]] ([[Clarice Blackburn]]); also brother-in-law to [[Naomi Collins]] ([[Joan Bennett]]). Jeremiah was uncle to [[Barnabas Collins]] ([[Jonathan Frid]]) who intended to marry [[Josette du Pres]] ([[Kathryn Leigh Scott]]).

However, Barnabas had a last minute fling on [[Martinique]] in [[1795]] with Josette's maid, [[Angelique (Dark Shadows)|Angelique]]. Josette was never wiser, even to her death. Then, Angelique heard from Barnabas that he, Barnabas Collins still intended to wed Josette and that Angelique was the merest of flings. This news angered Angelique and she hexed Jeremiah, placing him in her [[enchantment|thrall]] so he would marry her instead.

After [[Barnabas Collins]] learned this,  Barnabas and Jeremiah fought in a [[duel]] in which Barnabas shot him; later he would die at 2:00 A.M.
