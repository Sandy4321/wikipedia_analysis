'''Keith Morton Houchen''' (born 25 July 1960) is a former [[English people|English]] [[Association football|footballer]] and football manager. A [[Forward (association football)|forward]], he scored 184 goals in 687 league and cup games.

He started his professional career at [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] in February 1978, after failing to win a contract at [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]]. He was coached by [[Billy Horner]] to become a strong centre-forward, using his natural strength and power to retain possession in attacking positions. Financial difficulties forced the club to sell him on to [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] for <U+00A3>25,000 in March 1982. After failing to impress in his two years in London, he was moved on to [[York City F.C.|York City]] for <U+00A3>15,000 in March 1984. He played seven games in the club's [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] title winning season in 1983<U+2013>84, before transferring to [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] for <U+00A3>40,000 in March 1986. He did not settle at the club, but in the summer he was fortunate enough to win a <U+00A3>60,000 move up through three tiers to [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]. Though never a prolific player for the "Sky Blues", he scored a spectacular headed goal in the [[1987 FA Cup Final]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], which earned him [[Match of the Day]]'s [[Goal of the Season]] award. He featured in the [[1987 FA Charity Shield]], but faded from the first team picture at [[Highfield Road]], and in March 1989 he joined [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Scottish Premier Division]] side [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] for a fee of <U+00A3>325,000. He returned to England in August 1991 when he was sold to [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] for <U+00A3>100,000. After falling out with manager [[John Rudge]] he returned to Hartlepool on a free transfer in June 1993. He was appointed as player-manager in April 1995, but endured a tough time at [[Victoria Park, Hartlepool|Victoria Park]], and left the club in November 1996. He later coached at the [[Middlesbrough F.C. Reserves and Academy|Middlesbrough Academy]] and entered the property market.

==Playing career==
===Early years===
Keith Morton Houchen was born in [[Middlesbrough]] to Ken and Vernie Houchen, who both worked in [[social club]]s, and grew up some five minutes from [[Ayresome Park]].<ref name="page 15">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=15}}</ref> He grew up with three brothers; Jimmy, Dennis, and Patrick, who all joined the [[Coldstream Guards]]; and one sister, Jackie.<ref name="page 17">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=17}}</ref> He attended [[St Mary's College, Middlesbrough|St Mary's College]] as a youth.<ref name="page 17"/> A promising athlete and gifted footballer, as a youngster he travelled to [[London]] for a trial with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] along with John and [[Terry Fenwick]], but was told he was too lightweight at the time.<ref name="page 13">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=13}}</ref> After an unsuccessful trial with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], he became an apprentice at [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] in 1977.<ref name="page 13"/> 

===Hartlepool United===
He was not offered a professional contract at Chesterfield by manager [[Arthur Cox (footballer)|Arthur Cox]] and so left the club without making a senior appearance at [[Saltergate]].<ref name="page 15"/> However he was soon spotted playing amateur football in [[Nunthorpe]] by [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] manager [[Billy Horner]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=26}}</ref> Houchen joined the "Monkey Hangers" on non-contract terms, before turning professional in February 1978, signing a one year contract on <U+00A3>30 a week.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=27}}</ref> When he arrived at the [[Victoria Park, Hartlepool|Victoria Park]], Hartlepool were a struggling [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] club.<ref name="page 29">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=29}}</ref> He made his debut in a 1<U+2013>1 home draw with [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]].<ref name="page 29"/> Though grateful for the opportunity and training, Houchen lamented that "we used to have a mad rush to the bank to cash our cheques. Only about six of them would go through and the rest would [[Non-sufficient funds|bounce]]."<ref name="page 33">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=33}}</ref> He scored his first senior goal against [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] on 24 March 1978.<ref name="page 33"/> He bagged further goals against [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]], [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] and [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] to end the [[1977<U+2013>78 Football League|1977<U+2013>78]] campaign with four goals in 13 games.<ref name="page 33"/> He played regular first team football in [[1978<U+2013>79 Football League|1978<U+2013>79]], and scored 13 goals in 42 games to become the club's top scorer.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=38}}</ref> He then went on to score 14 goals in 44 games in [[1979<U+2013>80 Football League|1979<U+2013>80]], as the club finished 19th, just two points above the re-election zone.<ref name="page 40">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=40}}</ref> His goalscoring record attracted the attention of bigger clubs, however club chairman Vince Barker told [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] that even if Houchen was available then they would not be able to afford him.<ref name="page 40"/> His exploits continued into the following season, and the club rejected bids of up to <U+00A3>80,000 from [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] and [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=43}}</ref> He scored 17 goals in 48 appearances in [[1980<U+2013>81 Football League|1980<U+2013>81]], yet again becoming the club's top scorer, as Hartlepool were in the promotion hunt until a late spell of bad form sent them down the table to ninth.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=44}}</ref> He hit 19 goals in 38 games in [[1981<U+2013>82 Football League|1981<U+2013>82]] to become the club's top-scorer for a fourth consecutive season. However, having scored 65 goals in 170 league appearances, Houchen wanted a move to a bigger club at a higher division; he regularly handed in transfer requests, but all were ignored by the club.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=51}}</ref>

===Leyton Orient===
Hartlepool United were in dire financial straits by March 1982, and were <U+00A3>60,000 in debt to the [[Inland Revenue]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=53}}</ref> This crisis at the club allowed [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] manager [[Ken Knighton]] to take Houchen to [[Brisbane Road]] for a bargain price of <U+00A3>25,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=59}}</ref> He signed a four year contract on <U+00A3>225 a week with a <U+00A3>1,000 signing on fee.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=65}}</ref> He scored one goal against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 14 appearances, as the "O's" finished in last place and were relegated out of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1982.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=61}}</ref> He missed the start of the [[1982<U+2013>83 Football League|1982<U+2013>83]] campaign due to injury, but managed to hit ten goals in 38 games by the end of the season.<ref name="page 64">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=64}}</ref> His ten goals included one against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on the last day of the season, in a win which kept Orient in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]].<ref name="page 64"/> He scored ten goals in 34 games in [[1983<U+2013>84 Football League|1983<U+2013>84]], but was not highly rated by new boss [[Frank Clark (footballer)|Frank Clark]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=66}}</ref> For his part, Houchen said that Clark "would shout, and rant and rave, and tactically he wasn't particularly brilliant."<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=67}}</ref> He handed in a transfer request, which was accepted.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=68}}</ref>

===York City===
On 22 March 1984, [[York City F.C.|York City]] manager [[Denis Smith (footballer)|Denis Smith]] signed Houchen for a <U+00A3>15,000 fee,<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=73}}</ref> later saying that "anybody who could score sixty-five goals playing for Hartlepool must have something".<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=69}}</ref> He signed a two year contract on <U+00A3>225 a week.<ref name="page 74">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=74}}</ref> He scored on his debut against [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]] at the [[Recreation Ground (Aldershot)|Recreation Ground]], despite missing a penalty; he replaced [[Steve Senior]] in the second half, who had broken his leg.<ref name="page 74"/> The "Minstermen" went on to win the Fourth Division championship by a 16 point margin, with Houchen featuring mostly as a substitute in the final seven games.<ref name="page 75">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=75}}</ref> With [[John Byrne (footballer born 1961)|John Byrne]] and [[Keith Walwyn]] forming an effective striking partnership, Houchen played as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]].<ref name="page 75"/> He hit a hat-trick in a 7<U+2013>1 thrashing of [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] at [[Bootham Crescent]],<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=76}}</ref> and also converted a [[penalty kick|penalty]] that he had won to knock [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] out of the [[FA Cup]] at the Fourth Round.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=81}}</ref> He scored a total of 18 goals in 45 appearances in [[1984<U+2013>85 Football League|1984<U+2013>85]] to become the club's [[List of York City F.C. seasons|top scorer]]. However injuries helped to limit him to eight goals in 38 games in [[1985<U+2013>86 Football League|1985<U+2013>86]], and he decided to accept a move back down to the Fourth Division.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=89}}</ref>

===Scunthorpe United===
He was sold on to [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] for <U+00A3>40,000 in March 1986, signing a contract of <U+00A3>250 a week and receiving a car and an [[ex gratia]] payment of <U+00A3>10,000.<ref name="page 93">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=93}}</ref> Houchen later said that "it was the only time I ever gave up... it wasn't the right club because it wasn't going anywhere... I said to Yvonne, 'I'm just going to take the money'".<ref name="page 93"/> In doing so he rejected moves to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] and Third Division [[Bury F.C.|Bury]].<ref name="page 93"/> He quickly regretted the move, and despite getting along well with manager [[Frank Barlow (footballer)|Frank Barlow]] he found himself hating everything at the club, from the supporters to the [[Old Showground]] itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=94}}</ref>

===Coventry City===
After 97 days with the "Iron" he moved on to [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] for a <U+00A3>60,000 fee, after impressing in a reserve team game between the two clubs.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=98}}</ref> The management team of [[George Curtis (footballer born 1939)|George Curtis]] and [[John Sillett]] offered Houchen <U+00A3>350 a week, <U+00A3>50 an appearance, a <U+00A3>10,000 signing-on fee, as well the chance to play [[Football League First Division|First Division]] football.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=100}}</ref> He struggled with injuries at the start of the [[1986<U+2013>87 Coventry City F.C. season|1986<U+2013>87]] campaign, but recovered to ensure his name went down in [[History of Coventry City F.C.|the club's history]] for his exploits in the [[FA Cup]]. He bagged five goals in their [[1986<U+2013>87 FA Cup|1986<U+2013>87]] cup-winning run, the first being the winning goal away at [[Old Trafford]] against [[Alex Ferguson]]'s [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|pp=108}}</ref>  He then scored two against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in the quarter-finals, and one against [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] in the semi-finals, both games being held at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|pp=110-12}}</ref> The final and most famous goal of the run came in the [[1987 FA Cup Final]] in front of 98,000 spectators at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in a 3<U+2013>2 win over [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. However Houchen almost missed the match after catching [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]] from a [[trout]] caught by reserve goalkeeper [[Jake Findlay]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=120}}</ref> The goal came from a [[Dave Bennett (footballer born 1959)|Dave Bennett]] cross and was an instinctive full-stretch diving header that was impossible for [[Ray Clemence]] to save.<ref name="page 137">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=137}}</ref> It levelled the score at 2<U+2013>2 on 63 minutes, and an own goal from [[Gary Mabbutt]] in extra time won the game for Coventry. As well as his FA Cup winning medal, Houchen's header also earned him the [[BBC]] [[Match of the Day]]'s [[Goal of the Season]] award for the 1986<U+2013>87 season. This was due to the acrobatic effort involved and partly due to the incredible run he had made from deep midfield to meet the crossed ball. It is generally considered as one of the most famous goals scored at Wembley,<ref name="We" /> and certainly the best headed goal.

{{Quote|"I never took my eyes off the ball. I ran looking over my shoulder, watching the ball on the turn, running, running, so if it came, that was where I went... I couldn't honestly say to you that I was consciously thinking that if the ball comes in I can dive and head it <U+2013> it's all instinct. I think all football is instinct and the only way I could get on the end of the ball was to throw myself. It all finishes up as perfect timing <U+2013> the perfect ball, the perfect run <U+2013> but in a lot of ways it's a fluke. When it is all perfect timing, it is like a dance <U+2013> it all comes together. I do remember actually heading it. I knew I was getting it, I  knew I was going to get a good head on it, and you do think in the split second, 'Don't head it wide, don't head it over, don't miss-head it.'... I headed right past him [Clemence], right in the corner. It was past him before he could move, so it was just the perfect header."|Houchen recalls the moment that made his name synonymous with the FA Cup.<ref name="page 137"/>}}

Ironically, manager John Sillett spent much of the money from Coventry's FA Cup run (<U+00A3>750,000) on [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] striker [[David Speedie]], who would replace Houchen in front of goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=154}}</ref> Sillett's one consolation to Houchen was that he would play him in the [[1987 FA Charity Shield]], which ended in a 1<U+2013>0 defeat to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].<ref name="page 155">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=155}}</ref> The [[1987<U+2013>88 Football League|1987<U+2013>88]] season was poor for both club and player, as illness, injury and competition from Speedie, [[Gary Bannister]] and [[Cyrille Regis]] restricted Houchen to just three goals and 24 appearances.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=158}}</ref> On 14 August 1988, he was selected by [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] to represent [[the Football League]] in a game against Scunthorpe United to celebrate the opening of [[Glanford Park]]; Houchen scored once in a 6<U+2013>1 victory.<ref name="page 160">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=160}}</ref> He scored just twice in sixteen appearances in [[1988<U+2013>89 Football League|1988<U+2013>89]], though one of these goals was the winner against [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]] rivals [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in a 2<U+2013>1 [[Boxing Day]] victory at [[Highfield Road]].<ref name="page 160"/> He also featured as a substitute in the [[Sutton United 2<U+2013>1 Coventry City (1989)|infamous 2<U+2013>1 defeat]] to [[Conference National|Conference]] club [[Sutton United F.C.|Sutton United]] at [[Borough Sports Ground|Gander Green Lane]]; the last time a non-league club has beaten a top-flight side in a competitive fixture.<ref name="page 161">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=161}}</ref> The result was all the more remarkable considering that Coventry went on to finish seventh in the league and that Houchen was one of ten Coventry players that day who had won the FA Cup less than two years previously.<ref name="page 161"/>

===Hibernian===
In March 1989, he took a <U+00A3>325,000 transfer to [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Scottish Premier Division]] side [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], banking a <U+00A3>65,000 signing-on fee.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=164}}</ref> He had come close to signing for [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], but was not willing to move to [[London]] following his experience with Orient.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=166}}</ref> He scored on his debut, in a 2<U+2013>1 defeat to [[Edinburgh derby|Edinburgh rivals]] [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] at [[Tynecastle Stadium|Tynecastle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=168}}</ref> A further goal against [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] gave him two goals in eight games at the end of the [[1988<U+2013>89 Scottish Premier Division|1988<U+2013>89]] campaign.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=169}}</ref> He hit 12 goals in 39 games to become the [[List of Hibernian F.C. seasons|club's top scorer]] in [[1989<U+2013>90 Scottish Premier Division|1989<U+2013>90]], including two in wins over [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] at [[Easter Road]] and [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]], and one [[Hibernian F.C. in Europe|in Europe]] against [[Hungary|Hungarian]] side [[Videoton FC|Videoton]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=175}}</ref> "Hibs" exited the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] at the Second Round following defeat to [[Belgium|Belgian]] club [[R.F.C. de Li<U+00E8>ge]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=177}}</ref> Already riled by a telling off from manager [[Alex Miller]], Houchen had a run in with his own supporters following a defeat to [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] at [[Stark's Park]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=180}}</ref> Following this confrontation he was singled out for abuse at Easter Road.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=181}}</ref> He made his last appearance for the club in a [[Scottish Cup]] game against [[St. Johnstone F.C.|St. Johnstone]], during which he was sent off for kicking [[Tommy Turner]].<ref name="page 183">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=183}}</ref> Houchen later said that he liked Scotland but did not enjoy Scottish football, and was particularly critical of the standard of refereeing; referees were unwilling to punish fouls from defenders but quick to brandish cards for attackers who reacted poorly to being kicked.<ref name="page 183"/>

===Port Vale===
In August 1991 he returned to England with a <U+00A3>100,000 move to [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]]; he was one of three new arrivals, along with [[Peter Swan (footballer born 1966)|Peter Swan]] (who took him in as a lodger) and [[Martin Foyle]].<ref name="page 192">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=192}}</ref> He scored a brace against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]] on 3 September, but tore his hamstring later in the month.<ref name="page 192"/><ref name="kent">{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Jeff|title=Port Vale Personalities|publisher=Witan Books|page=143|year=1996|isbn=0-9529152-0-0|url=http://www.amazon.ca/Port-Vale-Personalities-Jeff-Kent/dp/0952915200}}</ref> He finished [[1991<U+2013>92 Port Vale F.C. season|1991<U+2013>92]] with five goals in 24 games, and went on to help the "Valiants" to win the TNT Tournament in the summer.<ref name="page 194">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=194}}</ref> The club finished bottom of the Second Division, though the introduction of the [[Premier League]] meant that they were demoted to the Third Division, which was immediately re-branded as the Second Division.<ref name="page 194"/> He scored six goals in 28 league games in [[1992<U+2013>93 Port Vale F.C. season|1992<U+2013>93]], and did not feature in the [[1993 Football League Trophy Final|League Trophy final]] or the [[1993 Football League Second Division play-off Final|play-off final]].<ref name="page 194"/> He fell out with manager [[John Rudge]] and the two stopped speaking to each other, and Houchen later admitted that "I should have knocked on the door and said, 'This is stupid'".<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=195}}</ref>

===Return to Hartlepool===
He left [[Vale Park]] on a free transfer in June 1993 and turned down a move to [[Cyprus]] outfit [[AC Omonia]] to return to former club Hartlepool United.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=197}}</ref> Injury meant he did not play for the man who signed him, [[Viv Busby]], and instead he made his second debut for the club under [[John MacPhail]].<ref name="page 201">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=201}}</ref> Houchen went on to score eight goals in 37 games as Hartlepool were relegated into the bottom tier of the Football League in [[1993<U+2013>94 Football League|1993<U+2013>94]], finishing a massive 17 points behind [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]], who were one point above the relegation zone.<ref name="page 201"/> MacPhail was quickly sacked and replaced by [[David McCreery]]; MacPhail blamed the fact that the club was sometimes unable to pay the player's wages as a reason for poor results on the field.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=203}}</ref> Houchen was a coach at the club, but quickly fell out with temporary 'advisory coach' [[Sandy Clark]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=204}}</ref> Houchen scored a hat-trick against Bury, though was later sent off in the match for allegedly swearing at referee Kevin Lynch; at the time of the incident Houchen was receiving treatment for knee ligament damage which would keep him out of action for six weeks.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=205}}</ref> McCreery resigned on 20 April 1995, and chairman Harold Hornsey appointed Houchen as his replacement; he became the 23rd manager at the club in 38 years.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=206}}</ref> He appointed his former boss Billy Horner as youth team coach and also employed [[Brian Honour]] and [[Mick Tait]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=209}}</ref> His first game in charge was a 4<U+2013>0 home win over [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]], and a 3<U+2013>0 defeat at [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] and a final day 3<U+2013>2 victory over [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]] ensured Hartlepool an 18th place finish.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=210}}</ref> As a player, he was the club's top scorer with 14 goals in 39 appearances in [[1994<U+2013>95 Football League|1994<U+2013>95]], and was voted Player of the Year by the club's supporters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Profile|url=http://www.inthemadcrowd.co.uk/cgi-bin/itmc_view_person.asp?oid=375|work=inthemadcrowd.co.uk|accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref>

The [[1995<U+2013>96 Football League|1995<U+2013>96]] season was to be his only full season as a manager. He scored six goals in 41 games, leading "Pools" to a 20th place finish on a budget of <U+00A3>260,000 a year.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=221}}</ref> His team were beaten 8<U+2013>0 by Arsenal over two legs in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and <U+2013> more worryingly <U+2013> were beaten 8<U+2013>0 by Crewe Alexandra in the [[Football League Trophy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=214}}</ref> He sold [[Nicky Southall]] to [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] for <U+00A3>40,000 and spent the same amount on striker [[Joe Allon]].<ref name="page 215">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=215}}</ref> He proved a disappointment, and both Allon and Houchen were sent off against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] on 28 October.<ref name="page 215"/> Houchen's final career goal came in a 3<U+2013>0 win over Bury on [[New Year's Day]].<ref name="page 215"/> 

He released goalkeeper [[Brian Horne]], who he described as a "fat slob"; this proved to be an unpopular move with "a lot of nasty people who support Hartlepool... who purport to support this club [but] would rather back fat professional players than people who really care about Hartlepool United".<ref name="page 235">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=235}}</ref> As his replacement he signed [[Stephen Pears]] from [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], as well as young defenders [[Glen Davies]] and [[Christopher McDonald (footballer)|Chris McDonald]], teenage winger [[David Clegg]], [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] midfielder [[Mark Cooper (footballer born 1968)|Mark Cooper]], and Blackpool midfielder [[Chris Beech]].<ref name="page 235"/> Hartlepool started the [[1996<U+2013>97 Football League|1996<U+2013>97]] campaign with wins over [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], but his playing career came to an end after the fifth game of the season, against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], when he retired due to a persistent knee injury.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=222}}</ref> He continued to bemoan referring decisions which seemed to consistently go against Hartlepool.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=224}}</ref> This in turn lead to continued punishments from the [[the Football Association|FA]] over his use of foul language towards officials.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=226}}</ref> With his team on a poor run of results at the foot of the table, he left the club by mutual consent on 4 November 1996.<ref name="page 232">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=232}}</ref> His assistant Mick Tait led the club to a 20th place finish, and organized a benefit match for Houchen against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], which raised <U+00A3>23,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=236}}</ref>

{{Quote|"I had to walk away from all that nonsense. I didn't deserve it. I'd put too much into the club to be treated like that. I'd put in so many hours. I'd tried and tried to get it going. I thought, 'I just can't stand it.'... The whole ground was singing 'Houchen Out'. I was standing behind the dug-out and thinking, 'I don't need this'... I felt very, very let down by the supporters of Hartlepool United Football Club... There are a lot of shit people following every club. They are everywhere, that type, with brains the size of a pea. I wouldn't keep the players they wanted, players who were patently not good enough and were really, really bad professionals... the majority of them [supporters] are nasty people. There are more of them at Hartlepool than elsewhere <U+2013> without a shadow of doubt."|After his last game in charge, a defeat to [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], a gang of Hartlepool supporters stayed after the match to demand Houchen's dismissal <U+2013> he remained resentful of these individuals long after leaving the club.<ref name="page 232"/><ref name="page 235"/>}}

==Style of play==
Houchen was a big {{convert|6|ft|1|in|m|2|abbr=on}} [[Forward (association football)|centre-forward]] who had strength and power. Early in his career he broke his [[rib]]s and [[Human vertebral column|backbone]], but learned the tricks of the trade, such as interlinking arms with opposition players to prevent them from jumping.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=32}}</ref> [[Billy Horner]] compared him with [[Malcolm Poskett]], and stated the only quality missing in Houchen's game was aggression.<ref name="page 30">{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=30}}</ref> Horner and his coaching team of [[George Smith (footballer born 1936)|George Smith]] and [[Willie Maddren]] taught Houchen how to protect himself from the highly physical centre-halfs that dominated the division, and the youngster learned how to hold the ball up and bring other players into the attack.<ref name="page 30"/>

==Personal life and post-retirement==
He married wife Yvonne on 17 July 1982;
<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=63}}</ref> the couple had two children: Cara and Ross (born 19 April 1987).<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=114}}</ref> They now live in [[Thirsk]].<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=249}}</ref> After retiring as a player, Houchen spent his time coaching at schools and at the [[Middlesbrough F.C. Reserves and Academy|Middlesbrough Academy]], collecting football statistics for the [[Press Association]], and renting out properties.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fissler|first=Neil|title=Port Vale - H|url=http://www.where-are-they-now.co.uk/port-vale/h.php|work=where-are-they-now.co.uk|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=247}}</ref>

He was a supporter of [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref name="page 155"/> He appeared as one of the players selected for the new [[Wembley Stadium]]'s 'Walk of Fame' prior to the venue's first [[FA Cup]] final in May [[2007 FA Cup Final|2007]].<ref name="We">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/6663117.stm|title=Houchen ready for Wembley return |last=Oliver|first=Pete|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=2 June 2009|date=17 May 2007}}</ref> A 256-page biography of his footballing career entitled ''A Tenner and a Box of Kippers'', written by Jonathan Strange, was published in 2006.<ref>{{harvnb|Strange|2006|p=1}}</ref> After reading the book, Houchen admitted that his comments about [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] came across as "a bit harsh".<ref>{{cite news|title="I'll never forget the day I signed"|url=http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news/local/quot_i_ll_never_forget_the_day_i_signed_quot_1_1016824|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=Hartlepool Mail|date=16 January 2007}}</ref>
