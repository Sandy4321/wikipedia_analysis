==Background and recording==
Minaj said about the song: "'Starships' is one of my absolute, absolute favorite records on ''Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded''. It just sounds like a [[Ryan Seacrest]]-type of record. And I'm so excited for you to give this song your blessing, Ryan, because I know people are gonna love it. It feels right. It just feels good. It makes people feel happy and that's all I want. I want to start the year off with making people feel good. The [Grammy] performance was the performance, that was my clear craziness, and now it's time to make people dance and have fun, and that<U+2019>s all I want to do". In a separate interview, she gave further details on the recording of the track: "There was so much love surrounding the making of the song, because RedOne is just so sweet to work with, he just sent me that one day, and he said, 'Hey, I got something for you!' I was like, 'You got to be kidding me, right?' I went to the studio and started writing ... scratch that ... I didn't even write the first verse! That was just me mumbling and just saying the first thing that came to my head, and we recorded it, because I just felt like: 'Let's go to the beach ... let's go get away.' It was just so good. It feels good!"<ref name="eurodance">{{cite web|last=Vena|first=Joceyln|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1679255/nicki-minaj-starships.jhtml|title=Nicki Minaj Shows Off 'Big Talent' On 'Starships'|work=MTV|publisher=Viacom|date=February 14, 2012|accessdate=February 15, 2012}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
The song received mainly mixed reviews. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said that "The new single will undoubtedly divide Minaj's fan base. Longtime fans may want the cypher queen they fell in love with when she was young and hungry on the mixtape circuit, while her newer, sugar pop-loving delegation will likely crave the quirkier verses -- and cotton candy-colored wigs -- of today's Minaj".<ref>{{cite web|author=February 14, 2012&nbsp;|&nbsp; 1:21 pm |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2012/02/nicki-minaj-starships-pop-star-aims.html |title=Nicki Minaj's 'Starships' reaffirms her pop star aims - latimes.com |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date=2012-02-14 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}</ref> [[MTV]] said that "The song not only is pure pop perfection, but RedOne's influence is evident, thanks to its grinding Euro dance beats", adding that "It is certainly the perfect song for those who enjoyed shaking their groove thang to "[[Super Bass]]". The lighthearted, feel-good vibe of the song is perfect for casual Barbz to blast. It's hard not to see Britney Spears' influence on the rapper/singer when listening to the song, and given that the two toured together last year, Minaj may be trying to remind her pop fans that she has an ear for what they want".<ref name="eurodance"/> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave a negative review, stating that it's "super clubby and contains almost no rapping, which continues Minaj's push into the complete opposite direction she should be heading."<ref>{{cite web|last=Franich |first=Darren |url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2012/02/14/nicki-minaj-starships-new-single/ |title=Nicki Minaj releases new song 'Starships': Hear it here &#124; The Music Mix &#124; EW.com |publisher=Music-mix.ew.com |date=2012-02-14 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}</ref> Bill Lamb from [[About.com]] was mixed with his review, stating: "Starships is a solid outing for Nicki Minaj. However, the day-glo pop-rap success of "Super Bass", emotional power of "[[Fly (Nicki Minaj song)|Fly]]", and experimentation of her Grammy Awards performance has left us expecting Nicki Minaj to push boundaries. "Starships" feels a little bit like retreating into a musical pocket and trying a little too hard to insure another pop chart hit. The result is pleasurable but not particularly memorable".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/od/singles/gr/Nicki-Minaj-Starships.htm |title=Review: Nicki Minaj - Starships |publisher=Top40.about.com |date=2009-11-08 |accessdate=2012-03-29}}</ref> [[Blog]]gers for ''Billboard'' magazine, Andrew Hampp and Erika Ramirez, criticized the track for, "...monstrous pop [[Hook (music)|hooks]] that overshadow its throwaway lyrics," while stating that it was, "the most polarizing single in Minaj's career to date." The pair also noticed that Minaj seemed to be exploring her "musical identity" through [[singing]], instead of focusing on her strengths.<ref name=billboardblog/>

==Music video==
===Background===
In early March 2012, a fan asked Minaj on [[Twitter]] if there will be a video for "Starships". She quickly replied, "Yes. Of course barbz. Don't be silly".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twitter.com/#!/nickiminaj|title=@NickiMinaj Tweets|accessdate=March 11, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://femalerappers.net/nicki-minaj-pink-friday-roman-reloaded-tracklist-will-be-revealed-next-week/|title=Nicki Minaj <U+2018>Pink Friday Roman Reloaded<U+2019> Tracklist Will Be Revealed Next Week!|date=March 10, 2012|accessdate=March 11, 2012}}</ref> The  "Starships" video was filmed in Oahu Island, [[Hawaii]], it was a 3-day shoot, filming began on March 13, 2012 and ended on March 15, 2012.

===Synopsis===
The music video opens with a spacecraft flying towards the island which was summoned by four men in red tribal garb and fedoras and the other islanders slowly awake as the craft passes overhead. The spacecraft then beams a  pink bikini-clad electric green haired Nicki down onto the beach and she begins to sing and cuts to some parts where Nicki is presumed as a highly worshipped goddess as she is seen in a pale pink bikini with matching strands attached on the bottom and short green hair being carried through the jungle with the other islanders following. There are then some kaleidoscope effects of her in the same outfit and on the beach and it then goes to a scene where we see Nicki dancing in the mountains wearing a white, pink and black bodysuit as well as black and green wedges and purple hair behind a glass box while some of the male islanders run up to her. It then goes to nighttime near the volcano where Nicki is sitting on top of the box in the same outfit with some islanders dancing around her and show her again in the kaleidoscope effect and previous outfit but this time it's under blacklights. The final scene is Nicki with blonde hair wearing a white fringed strapless bikini and splattered with paint at a party in her honor. The music video ends with her singing the last line while looking directly into the camera.
===Reception===
John Mitchell of MTV criticized the video's postponed release, finding it strange that the video for the album's third single, "[[Beez in the Trap]]", was released before the "Starships" video.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=John|title=Nicki Minaj's 'Starships' Video 'May Be Too Saucy For TV'|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1683755/nicki-minaj-starships-music-video.jhtml|work=MTV News|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=27 April 2012}}</ref>
