'''Friedrich "Fritz" Gei<U+00DF>hardt''' (22 January 1919 &ndash; 6 April 1943) was a [[Germany|German]] former [[Luftwaffe]] [[fighter ace]] and recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] with Oak Leaves during [[World War II]]. A flying ace or fighter ace is a [[military aviation|military aviator]] credited with shooting down five or more enemy [[aircraft]] during aerial combat.<ref>Spick 1996, pp. 3<U+2013>4.</ref> The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, with its higher grade Oak Leaves, was awarded to recognise exceptional battlefield bravery or military leadership. 

"Fritz" Gei<U+00DF>hardt is credited with 102 victories in 642 combat missions, including 37 [[close air support]] missions. He achieved 63 of his victories over the Eastern front. In his total are at least seventeen [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]].<ref name="Obermaier p51">Obermaier 1989, p. 51.</ref> Gei<U+00DF>hardt was mortally wounded in combat with US bombers on 5 April 1943 and succumbed to his injuries the next day.

==Military career==
Friedrich "Fritz" Gei<U+00DF>hardt was born on 22 January 1919 in [[Sonnefeld]], near [[Coburg]] in [[Oberfranken]]. He joined the military service of the Luftwaffe in 1937 and was transferred to the 2./[[Lehrgeschwader 2]] (LG 2&mdash;2nd Squadron of the 2nd Demonstration Wing) on 1 July 1939.<ref name="Obermaier p51"/><ref group="Notes">For an explanation of the meaning of Luftwaffe unit designation see [[Luftwaffe Organization]]</ref>

During the opening phase of the German [[invasion of Poland]], I.(Jagd)/LG 2 (1st Fighter Group of the 2nd Demonstration Wing) relocated to Lauenburg (now [[L<U+0119>bork]]), near [[Bromberg]], in support of the [[4th Army (Germany)|4. ''Armee'']] (4th Army). ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' (a non-commissioned officer) Gei<U+00DF>hard claimed his first aerial victory, a [[PWS-26]] biplane, that day.<ref>Weal 1996, p. 10.</ref> The following day, flying his [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]], Gei<U+00DF>hardt had to make an emergency landing behind Polish lines. After several hours in Polish captivity, he escaped during the confusion caused by a German [[Stuka]] (Dive Bomber) attack. He reached German lines after walking for five days.<ref name="Obermaier p51"/>

Gei<U+00DF>hardt was transferred to the 1./LG 2 (1st Squadron of the 2nd Demonstration Wing) on 27 February 1940. By the end of 1940, he claimed six [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) aircraft shot down during the [[Battle of Britain]], followed by six more claims in early 1941. He achieved four victories on 6 April 1941 in the aerial battles of the [[Balkans Campaign]], and two [[Hawker Hurricane]]s in the German [[Invasion of Crete]].<ref name="Obermaier p51"/>

He was posted as an adjutant of the ''[[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|Stab]]'' to the I.(Jagd)/LG 2 at the end of April 1941. He achieved his 20th aerial victory on 23 June 1941 and received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes'') on 30 August 1941, after 27 aerial victories. He shot down further enemy aircraft in quick succession in the early part of 1942.<ref name="Obermaier p51"/> On 3 and 4 February 1942 Gei<U+00DF>hardt and ''Oberleutnant'' [[Erwin Clausen]] shot down three [[Polikarpov R-5]]s or [[Polikarpov R-Z]]s of 622 LBAP (''Legkii Bombardirovochnyy Aviatsionyy Polk''&mdash;Light Bomber Aviation Regiment) and 672 LBAP.<ref>Bergstr<U+00F6>m and Mikhailov 2001, p. 76.</ref> He claimed his 40th victory on 1 March 1942, his 50th on 19 April 1942, 52nd&ndash;56th on 20 April 1942, 61st&ndash;67th on 25 April 1942. He was appointed ''[[Staffelkapit<U+00E4>n]]'' of the 3./[[Jagdgeschwader 77]] (JG 77&mdash;3rd Squadron of the 77th Fighter Wing).<ref name="Obermaier p51"/>

''[[Oberleutnant]]'' (First Lieutenant) Gei<U+00DF>hardt was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves (mit Eichenlaub)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak leaves]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub'') on 23 June 1942 for 79 aerial victories. The award was presented at the ''[[F<U+00FC>hrerhauptquartier]]'' at [[Rastenburg]] on 28 and 29 June 1942. By this date, he had claimed three more victories for an accumulated number of 82 victories.<ref>Weal 2007, p. 26.</ref><ref name="Obermaier p51"/>

Shortly after the Oak Leaves presentation, the ''Gruppe'' transferred from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]] to [[Sicily]] in Italy. Gei<U+00DF>hardt destroyed nine enemy aircraft in the aerial battles of [[Siege of Malta|Malta]] by the end of October 1942 (83&ndash;91). He added nine more victories in the [[North African Campaign]], among them his century on 10 November 1942.<ref name="Obermaier p51"/>

''[[Hauptmann]]'' (Captain) Gei<U+00DF>hardt arrived at [[Wevelgem]] on 11 January 1943 to take over command as ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' (group commander) of the III. ''Gruppe'' (3rd group) of [[Jagdgeschwader 26]] (JG 26) from ''[[Major]]'' [[Josef Priller]]. Gei<U+00DF>hardt's arrogance grated on some of the pilots, who felt that he treated his fellow pilots who had not yet earned the Knight's Cross with too much disdain.<ref>Caldwell 1998, p. 43.</ref>

''Hauptmann'' Gei<U+00DF>hardt, who was flying [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Fw 190 A-4]] (''Werknummer'' 7051&mdash;factory number) in ''Major'' Priller's ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe during World War II#Schwarm, Rotte and Kette|Schwarm]]'', was severely wounded in combat with [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] of the [[306th Bomb Group]] on 5 April 1943. He had been hit by the defensive fire from the bombers. He was bleeding profusely from a wound in the [[Human abdomen|abdomen]] but managed to make a smooth landing on the airfield at [[Sint-Denijs-Westrem]], Belgium. He succumbed to his injuries early the next morning on 6 April 1943.<ref>Caldwell 1998, p. 43.</ref>
