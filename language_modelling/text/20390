'''''Le Menage Moderne Du Madame Butterfly''''' is a [[bisexuality|bisexual]], [[Hardcore pornography|hardcore]] [[pornographic film]] from [[France]]. It is notable for being the earliest known adult film to incorporate bisexual and homosexual intercourse.<ref name="Burger">Burger, John R.

==Background==
[[Bernard Natan]] was a [[Romania|Romanian]] [[Jew]] who had produced, directed and acted in at least one hardcore heterosexual pornographic film prior to 1920.  In 1920, at the end of [[World War I]], Natan emigrated to [[France]]. Between 1920 and 1927, he produced, directed and acted in at least 20 more porn films (a prolific number of films, considering the period and technology). Several of these films included homosexual and bisexual oral and anal intercourse. Natan himself engaged in homosexual and bisexual sex on film.<ref name="Waugh">Waugh, Thomas. ''Hard To Imagine.'' New York: Columbia University Press, 1996. ISBN 0231099983</ref><ref name="Slade">Slade, Joseph. "Bernard Natan: France's Legendary Pornographer." ''Journal of Film and Video.'' 45:2-3 (Summer-Fall 1993).</ref>

''Le Menage Moderne Du Madame Butterfly'' is one the earliest of Natan's pornographic films, and the first of his works to depict homosexuality and bisexuality.<ref name="Waugh" /> Although the release date is uncertain, scholars believe the film was distributed as early as 1920.<ref name="Burger" />

The production values on the film are notably high, even for a mainstream feature film.  It includes location shots of an Asian street full of [[rickshaw]]s and a sailing ship on the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The costumes and sets are almost lavish. The film has a lengthy and complex plot, and includes [[intertitle]]s.<ref name="Waugh" />

==Synopsis==
The film is based on the [[opera]] ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' by [[Giacomo Puccini]].<ref name="Waugh" />

"Lt. Pinkerton" (played by mainstream French actor J. R. Forsell) is a strapping American sailor on leave in [[Japan]]. He marries the young "Madame Butterfly" (an uncredited actress) and ravishes her while Butterfly's maid, "Soosooky" (another uncredited actress) watches and masturbates. Pinkerton then abandons Butterfly.  A new character, "the [[coolie]] boy" (played by Natan), spies on Butterfly and Soosooky as they engage in [[lesbian]] sex. He masturbates while watching them.

Pinkerton returns, and engages in oral and anal homosexual intercourse with the "coolie boy." Pinkerton then engages and oral, anal and vaginal sex with Soosooky.  Mr. Sharpless (an uncredited actor) meets with Butterfly and has various types of sex with her.  Afterward, he tells Butterfly that Pinkerton has returned, but is married to an American woman.  Pinkerton, Soosooky and the "coolie boy" enter. An angry Butterfly denounces Pinkerton, but cannot resist his charms.  All five individuals have sexual intercourse. The "coolie boy" engages in receptive anal intercourse with Pinkerton and Sharpless while performing [[cunnilingus]] on the women.  While having vaginal and anal sex with the women, the "coolie boy" also [[fellatio|fellates]] Pinkerton and Sharpless.

There are two extant sets of intertitles.  The French intertitles are generally witty and humorous, poking fun at racism and American arrogance while making a number of [[double entendre]]s. The [[English language|English]] intertitles are far more crude and [[racism|racist]] in tone.<ref name="Waugh" />

==Notability==
''Le Menage Moderne Du Madame Butterfly'' is the oldest known motion picture to depict hardcore homosexual sex acts on film.<ref name="Burger" /><ref name="Waugh" /><ref name="Slade">

The first known motion pictures depicting nude men were made by [[Eadweard Muybridge]] in the 1880s and 1890s as part of his studies of human locomotion.<ref>Williams, Linda. ''Hard Core: Power, Pleasure, and the "Frenzy of the Visible."'' Expanded ed. Berkeley, Calif.: University of California Press, 1999. ISBN 0520219430</ref>

The first known pornographic film was made in 1908.  Between 1908 and the advent of public theatrical screenings in the [[United States]] in 1970, about 2,000 hardcore pornographic films were made. About 500 of these were made prior to 1960. The best estimate is that about 10 percent of all hardcore "stag films" made prior to 1970 contain some sort of homosexual activity. This ranges from an innocuous hand on a shoulder, thigh or hip to hardcore anal and oral sex (and much more). Nevertheless, nearly all the extant works depict homosexual sex in the context of a heterosexual [[hegemony]]. Most depict homosexual sex occuring during heterosexual intercourse (essentially making the sex act bisexual in nature).<ref name="Waugh" />

''Le Menage Moderne Du Madame Butterfly'' is unusual in that it not only depicts homosexual sex acts, but that it does so very early in the history of pornographic film. However, like most of the films which came after it, ''Le Menage Moderne Du Madame Butterfly'' only shows male-male sex acts as deviant, firmly establishes the heterosexuality of the characters, and often depicts the sex acts as essentially bisexual (male-male sexual contact occurs while men are also having heterosexual intercourse).<ref name="Burger" /><ref name="Waugh" />

The film is also notable for being one of the first adult films to be produced or directed by Bernard Natan. Scholars have expressed surprise that a beginning filmmaker would produce a work which had the opportunity to anger or offend its target audience (straight men).<ref name="Slade" />

Natan's willingness to not only produce, write, and direct but also star in a hardcore bisexual film is even more startling when one recognizes that, within nine years of the release of ''Le Menage Moderne Du Madame Butterfly,'' Bernard Natan would be the owner of the largest mainstream film studio in France<U+2014>[[Path<U+00E9>]].<ref>Abel, Richard.
