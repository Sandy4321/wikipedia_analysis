'''Polish euro coins''' have not yet been designed.  

[[Poland]] has been a member of the [[European Union]] since [[May 2004]], and is a member of the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]] but has not completed the third stage of the EMU and therefore still uses its own [[currency]], the [[Polish z<U+0142>oty]].

Currently, there is no official information on the design process for the Polish national sides, though it has been indicated that some kind of public vote will be used.

Controversially, Poland has not yet set an official target date for introduction of the euro, which led to much criticism from the [[EU Commission]]. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Accession 2003]], all [[New Member States]] "shall participate in the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]] from the date of Accession as a Member State with a derogation", which means that Poland is obliged to introduce the euro. It should be noted, however, that [[Sweden]] is technically also obliged to introduce the euro, which is not planned to be reconsidered until [[2009]] after a referendum in [[2003]] resulted in a clear "no". It has been warned however, that any move similar to that of Sweden in the new states will not be tolerated, as it has been with Sweden.

The adoption of the euro is integral part of the [[Treaty of Accession 2003]]. A referendum on this accession has already been held in Poland, on [[June 2003#June 8, 2003|June 7-8]] [[2003]], but no separate referendum has been held on the adoption of the euro specifically.

On January 17, 2006, Polish Finance Minister [[Zyta Gilowska]] said in an interview that Poland will not adopt the euro before 2010, adding that [[2011]] was an achievable deadline.
