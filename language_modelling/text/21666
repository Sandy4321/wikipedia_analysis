'''Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton, Kt., '''  [[Royal Victorian Order|CVO]], [[Order of British Empire|OBE]] ([[15 February]] [[1874]] <U+2013> [[5 January]] [[1922]]) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[explorer]]. Born in Kilkea, [[Ireland]], Shackleton embarked on four [[Antarctic]] expeditions and was knighted for travelling the furthest south of any contemporary human on his voyage aboard ''[[Nimrod (ship)|Nimrod]]''. He was also an unsuccessful candidate for [[parliament]] and was involved in business ventures aimed at raising revenue for his [[polar exploration]]s.

Shackleton is most noteworthy for leading the unsuccessful [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]], colloquially known as the "[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]] Expedition" or "Shackleton's voyage", between 1914 and 1916. Although Shackleton failed to achieve his goal of crossing the Antarctic continent on foot, he demonstrated the leadership for which he is now  known when the ship ''Endurance'' became trapped in the ice and was destroyed.  Shackleton, known by his contemporaries as "the Boss", led his men to refuge on [[Elephant Island]] before heading across {{convert|1287|km|mi|0}} of the open [[Antarctic Ocean]] to [[South Georgia|South Georgia Island]] with five other men. Upon reaching the remote island, Shackleton crossed severe, mountainous terrain to reach a whaling station at [[Grytviken]], where he was able to muster a ship to rescue his men on Elephant Island. All the men on ''Endurance'' survived their ordeal after spending 22&nbsp;months in the Antarctic, although three men of the [[Ross Sea Party]] lost their lives.<ref name="PBS">{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/shackleton/surviving/quest.html |title=Quest for the Pole: Historic Antarctic Land Journeys|author=Tyler, Kelly |work= NOVA Online | publisher= PBS |accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref><ref name="Johnson">Johnson, pp.&nbsp;1-12</ref><ref name="Huntford">Huntford, pp.&nbsp;9<U+2013>11, 117</ref><ref name="Rubin">Rubin, pp.&nbsp;42<U+2013>55</ref> 

Shackleton was a key figure in the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]] alongside [[Roald Amundsen]], [[Douglas Mawson]], and [[Robert Falcon Scott]], each of whom is famed for exploits that captured the public imagination.  In recent times, he has become known for his leadership skills, and is the topic of many books and films that focus on the explorer's ability to lead men through challenging conditions.<ref name="Perkins">Perkins, p.&nbsp;89</ref>

==Life==
[[Image:Ernest Shackleton.jpg|thumb|left|Ernest Shackleton in the polar region, circa 1916]]
===Childhood===
Shackleton was born on [[15 February]] [[1874]], in Kilkea, [[County Kildare]], [[Ireland]], about {{convert|48|km|mi|0}} from [[Dublin]]. Ernest's father, Henry, and mother, Henrietta Sophia Gaven, were of English-Irish ancestry. Ernest was the second of their ten children and the first of two sons.<ref name="Johnson"/> In childhood he was described as "bright, good-natured,... and confident".<ref name="Huntford"/> In 1880, at six years old, Ernest moved to Dublin with his father, who was studying medicine.<ref name="Johnson"/> Four years later, the family moved from Ireland to [[Sydenham]] in suburban London to seek a better income and because their Anglo-Irish ancestry made them afraid to stay in Ireland after the  assassination of [[Lord Frederick Cavendish]] by Irish nationalists.<ref name="Mill"/> Shackleton spent the remainder of his childhood in Sydenham.<ref name="Johnson"/>  

Ernest was schooled by a governess until the age of 11, when he entered Fir Lodge Preparatory School in West Hill, and was educated from ages 13 to 16 at [[Dulwich College]], a public school for boys.<ref name="Mill"/> The young Shackleton did not distinguish himself as a scholar and was said to have been "bored" by his studies.<ref name="Huntford"/> He was quoted later as saying:

{{Quotation|"I never learned much geography at school... Literature, too, consisted in the dissection, the parsing, the analysing of certain passages from our great poets and prose-writers ... teachers should be very careful not to spoil their taste for poetry for all time by making it a task and an imposition."|Ernest Shackleton|<ref name="Huntford"/>}} 

In his final term at the college, however, he was able to achieve fifth place in his class of thirty-one.<ref name="Mill">Mill, pp.&nbsp;24, 72<U+2013>80, 104<U+2013>115, 150</ref>  Furthermore, throughout his career, Shackleton was a voracious reader, which contributed to the broadening of his horizons.<ref name="Kimmel">Kimmell, pp.&nbsp;4<U+2013>5</ref>

===Maritime career===
At 16, Shackleton embarked on his career by joining the [[British Merchant Navy|merchant marine]]. He chose this path for two reasons. Firstly, the fee to join a [[Royal Navy]] cadet ship was too expensive, and secondly, his father was able to procure him employment at the North Western Shipping Company aboard the sailing vessel ''Houghton Tower''.<ref name="Huntford"/> This position allowed Shackleton to experience life at sea without the strictness of the Navy. Hence, the young man formed acquaintances with a variety of people<U+2014>"officer, engineers, and apprentices alike."<ref name="Perkins"/> Following his initial voyage, Ernest agreed to a four-year commitment, and in 1898, at the age of 24, he became a [[Master Mariner]], which entitled him to command a vessel.<ref name="Kimmel"/>

After Shackleton completed the programme, his father arranged a meeting between Ernest and Antarctic expedition donor Llewellyn Longstaff. Longstaff admired the young man's keenness, and when Ernest asked him for assistance in joining [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s expedition to the Antarctic, Longstaff complied.  Shackleton was soon accepted as a member of the [[National Antarctic Expedition]].<ref name="Johnson"/>

==Expedition years==
===''Discovery'' Expedition (1901<U+2013>02)===
{{main|Discovery Expedition}}
[[Image:Discoveryboat.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Discovery'']]
The British National Antarctic Expedition, also known as the Discovery Expedition after the ship [[RRS Discovery|RRS ''Discovery'']] (1901<U+2013>04), was led by [[Robert Falcon Scott]] with the purpose of undertaking scientific research and exploration along the coast of the [[Ross Sea]] in [[Antarctica]].<ref name="Swan">Swan, pp.&nbsp;4<U+2013>5</ref> It was the first time Scott had led an expedition, although he did have command experience in the Royal Navy.<ref name="Speake">Speake, p.&nbsp;1072,1079</ref> Shackleton was assigned the duty of outfitting ''Discovery'' for the expedition.<ref name="Johnson"/> Scott and Shackleton had different backgrounds, with Scott having trained in the Royal Navy and preferring strict discipline. As a result, the relationship between Scott and Shackleton was tense.<ref name="Way"/>

''Discovery'' departed London on [[31 July]] [[1901]] for Antarctica.<ref name="Turley">Turley, p.&nbsp;31</ref> The team spent two summers in Antarctica, and Shackleton joined Scott and [[E. A. Wilson|Edward Wilson]], assistant surgeon and vertebrate zoologist, in an attempt on the [[South Pole]] in 1902.<ref name="Mill"/>  The journey proceeded under difficult conditions as food was in short supply, and the party was forced to march up to {{convert|40|km|mi}} a day. The team reached as far south as {{nowrap|82<U+00B0> 17' S}} on [[31 December]] [[1902]]; however they were unable to continue because of terrain, severe conditions, and the onset of scurvy. Shackleton also suffered from heart and lung ailments.<ref name="Mill"/><ref name="Way">Caparrell&nbsp;&&nbsp;Morrell, pages&nbsp;30,31,32,42,53,61,89,91,141.</ref> Notably, they were {{convert|857|km|mi|0}} from the Pole and {{convert|412|km|mi|0}} further south than any human had previously travelled.<ref name="Preston">Preston, pp.&nbsp;60<U+2013>68</ref>

Shackleton was sent home by Scott aboard the ship ''[[SY Morning|Morning]]'' because of illness, even though he had nearly fully recovered.<ref name="Mill"/> [[Roland Huntford]] (a noted critic of Scott) has posited that Scott resented Shackleton's popularity and used health as an excuse to remove him.<ref name="Huntford"/> Indeed, Shackleton had been well-liked among his men, even cheering the men by producing a Christmas pudding he had hidden in his socks, whereas Scott had reduced [[rationing|rations]] during the march and required military discipline, having the crew mop the decks despite the water freezing immediately.<ref name="Preston"/><ref name="Way"/> Diana Preston alleges that Scott had perhaps blamed Shackleton for the march's failure, as when he was confronted by the ship's doctor with evidence that Shackleton was not particularly sick he said, "If he does not go back sick he will go back in disgrace."<ref name="Preston"/> Contradicting Preston's claim is the work of biographer [[Ranulph Fiennes]] who asserts that there is little evidence that the two were unfriendly and that Shackleton was indeed sent home because he was ill. Regardless, Shackleton and Scott continued on friendly terms in subsequent correspondence, although the ''Discovery'' experience is described as a  "defining moment of Shackleton's life" and profoundly disappointing.<ref name="Huntford"/><ref name="Way"/><ref name="Speake"/> Though they were publicly amicable Shackleton and Scott continued to rival one another's exploits and compete for monetary resources and staff throughout their lives.<ref name="Way"/>

===Between the ''Discovery'' and ''Nimrod'' expeditions===
[[Image:Emily Dorman (Lady Shackelton).jpg|thumb|left|Ernest Shackleton's wife, Emily Dorman (Lady Shackleton)]]
Shackleton left ''The Discovery'' on [[28 February]] [[1902]] to cheers from her crew, and set off on ''Morning'' for Lyttleton, [[New Zealand]].<ref name="Mill"/><ref name="Huntford"/> In mid-June 1903, he returned to [[London]] to a good reception, particularly from Sir John Murray, president of the Royal Scottish Geographic Society, and Sir Joseph Hooker, a surgeon from an earlier expedition to the Antarctic.  They presented him as the first praiseworthy person to return from the ''Discovery'' Expedition.<ref name="Mill"/> Additionally, Shackleton noticed that Londoners had an unquenchable desire for his tales of the Antarctic, which helped him lay the groundwork for further expeditions.  

In London, Shackleton was offered a position in the Royal Navy as a [[lieutenant]].  Shackleton instead opted to assist in outfitting a supply ship for his old expedition. Further, he was offered a secretaryship with the [[Royal Geographic Society]].<ref name="Mill"/> He was searching for an office job in order to be able to marry 29-year-old Emily Mary Dorman, with whom he shared a love of literature, particularly [[Robert Browning]].<ref name="Johnson"/> Indeed, he did marry Dorman on [[9 April]] [[1904]]. The marriage produced three children, the youngest of which was Edward, who would be first Westerner to climb [[Mount Mulu]] in Borneo.<ref name="Way"/><ref name="Mill"/>. Throughout his explorations, Shackleton would write long letters to Emily.<ref name="Way"/> Although Shackleton was generous to the family of crew by providing provisions to them in the case of accidental death, he did not sufficiently protect his own family as his wife was required to live on her own resources following his death. Margot Morrell asserts that he was romantically connected with American actress Rosalind Chetwynd.<ref name="Way"/>

He was also active in organizing an Antarctic relief mission with the Argentine government and arranging troop transportation for the Russians.<ref name="Way"/> In 1906, Shackleton ventured into politics, supporting the [[Liberal Unionist Party]] and unsuccessfully standing for Parliament in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906 general election]] in [[Dundee (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee]], garnering 3,865&nbsp;votes to the victor's 9,276.<ref name="Morrell">Morrell, p.&nbsp;32</ref> At the same time, Shackleton was preparing for another expedition to the Antarctic by raising funds and thus was active as a mill promoter and in business ventures such as a tobacco company. The mill owner, [[William Beardmore]], was impressed with Shackleton and helped sponsor his next expedition. Shackleton also used his connections with wealthy friends to raise capital, and subsequently convinced Sir [[Phillip Lee Brocklehurst]] and author Campbell Mackellar to finance his expedition.<ref name="Rubin"/><ref name="Mill"/><ref name="Mill"/> With funds attained, Shackleton presented his idea for an Antarctic expedition to the Royal Geographic Society in competition with a proposal from [[Henryk Arctowski]].  Shackleton's project was chosen, and on [[12 February]] [[1907]], the details of the voyage, named the [[British Imperial Antarctic Expedition]], were published in the Royal Society's newsletter, ''Geographic Journal''.<ref name="Mill"/>

===''Nimrod'' Expedition (1907<U+2013>09) ===
{{main|Nimrod Expedition}}
[[Image:TheSouthernParty.jpg|thumb|left|The South Pole Party (left to right): Wild, Shackleton, [[Eric Marshall|Marshall]] and [[Jameson Adams|Adams]]]]

On [[1 January]] [[1908]], ''[[Nimrod Expedition|Nimrod]]'' sailed from [[Lyttleton Harbour]], beginning the [[British Imperial Antarctic Expedition]].<ref name="Davis">Davis, p.&nbsp;146</ref><ref name="Mill"/> The trip's goal was to land a party of between nine and twelve men, who would then proceed to the South Pole, at the site of ''Discovery'''s landing in February 1908 and to return to retrieve them in 1909. The party was to break into three groups, two of which would explore [[Edward VII Peninsula|King Edward VII Land]] and Mount Melbourne. The third and main team was to reach the geographic [[South Pole]].<ref name="Mill"/> 

To conserve coal, the ship was towed {{convert|2700|km|mi|0}} by ''Konya'' to the Antarctic ice. <ref name="Rubin"/>  Shackleton arranged for the expense to be split between the [[New Zealand]] government and the Union Steamship Company.<ref name="Mill"/><ref name="Rubin"/> Upon arrival on [[14 January]] [[1908]], at the Antarctic Circle, the crew found that ''Discovery'''s base camp was inaccessible. Accordingly, Shackleton's base camp was built on [[Ross Island]] at Cape Royds, about {{convert|40|km|mi|0}} north of the planned site.<ref name="Rubin"/><ref name="Mill"/> The party was in high spirits despite difficult conditions and the sickness of crew members. During this trip, Shackleton acquired his nickname, "the Boss", due to his leadership abilities, which focused on camaraderie and admiration.<ref name="Way"/>
[[Image:Shackleton-1909.jpg|right|thumb|Ernest Shackleton in a publicity photo taken before the 1907<U+2013>09 ''Nimrod'' Antarctic expedition]]

The team was unable to attain its goal of reaching the South Pole because team-member [[Frank Wild]] was almost killed when a pony fell into a crevasse, injuring him and depriving the party of rations. Indeed, they were desperate for food, and Shackleton decided that it would be impossible for the entire team to return alive if they continued.<ref name="Way"/> However, Shackleton and his companions reached {{nowrap|88<U+00B0> 23' S}}, a point only {{convert|180|km|mi|0}} from the Pole, which would stand as the "Farthest South" record until Amundsen reached the Pole in 1911 (followed shortly by Robert Scott's ill-fated [[Terra Nova Expedition]] which Shackleton had assisted by managing the ordering of provisions).<ref name="Mill"/><ref name="Way"/>  The expedition's accomplishments also included the first ascent of [[Mount Erebus]], an expedition to the approximate location of the [[Magnetic South Pole]] by [[Edgeworth David]], [[Douglas Mawson]], and [[Alistair MacKay]] ([[16 January]] [[1909]]), and the discovery of the [[Beardmore Glacier]] passage (named after Shackleton's patron). The group was the first to cross the Trans-Antarctic mountain range and to set foot on the South Polar Plateau.<ref name="Rubin"/>

Shackleton's party subsisted on half-rations during the return march, and at one point the Boss gave the one biscuit allotted for the day to Frank Wild.<ref name="Mill"/> With conditions dire, the group returned to base camp on [[28 February]] [[1909]], and found a letter stating that ''Nimrod'' had sailed two days earlier. In response, the men burnt the camp to attract the departing ship's attention. The ploy succeeded, and by 1&nbsp;a.m. on [[4 March]] [[1909]], the whole party boarded for home.<ref name="Shackleton_South"/> 

Shackleton returned to the [[United Kingdom]] as a hero and was [[knighthood|knighted]].<ref name="Mill"/> Soon after, he published a book about ''Nimrod'''s expedition titled ''The Heart of the Antarctic''.<ref>Shackleton,&nbsp;''Heart of the Antarctic...'',&nbsp;p.&nbsp;Front&nbsp;Cover</ref> Regarding the failure to reach the South Pole, Shackleton remarked to his wife: "Better a live donkey than a dead lion."<ref>Peter,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;347</ref>

Although Amundsen reached the South Pole in 1911, interest in the Antarctic continued. Shackleton solicited investment from donors to launch a trans-Antarctic expedition to carry the British flag across the continent from the Weddell Sea on the Atlantic side to the [[Ross Sea]] on the Pacific side by way of the pole. The largest contribution, <U+00A3>24,000, came from [[James Key Caird]]. Shackleton was also able to acquire funds from the British government (<U+00A3>10,000); the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (<U+00A3>1,000); [[Janet Stancomb-Wills|Dame Janet Stancomb-Wills]], daughter of a tobacco tycoon; and Dudley Docker of the [[Birmingham Small Arms Company]].<ref>According to Shackleton in ''South'', three glacial features along the [[Caird Coast]] of Antarctica have names chosen by him: the [[Stancomb-Wills Promontory]], the Dawson-Lambton Glacier, and the [[McDonald Ice Rumples]].</ref><ref name="Shackleton_South">Shackleton</ref> During his career Shackleton was able to raise the equivalent of what would today be $10 million for his trips.<ref name="Way"/> 

Interest in the expedition was enormous: Shackleton received more than 5,000&nbsp;applications for participation. He chose people he considered the most qualified candidates, either from his personal experience<U+2014>eight came from the ''Nimrod'' expedition<U+2014>or on the recommendation of his colleagues. Shackleton's interview process was unique: he frequently asked unconventional questions such as "what songs can you sing" or if the candidate "knew gold when he saw it."<ref name="Way"/> In this way he hoped to build group camaraderie for the difficult journey ahead. Shackleton also encouraged ''esprit de corps'' by dissolving traditional hierarchies. For example, all men were required to take shifts on watch and scrubbing the deck.<ref name="Way"/> In all, fifty-six men were chosen and divided into two groups, and Shackleton acquired two ships: ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'' for a Weddell Sea team and ''[[Aurora (ship)|Aurora]]'' for a Ross Sea Party.<ref name="Shackleton_South"/>

''Endurance'' departed [[Plymouth]] for the Antarctic on [[8 August]] [[1914]], with 28&nbsp;men.<ref name="Shackleton_South"/> As ''Endurance'' approached Antarctica, ice conditions worsened, until on [[17 January]] ''Endurance'' became frozen in place, and Shackleton ordered the ship wintered.<ref>Frank Worsley, captain of ''Endurance'', later wrote in ''Shackleton's Boat Journey'' that after the ship had initially become surrounded by ice, gales from the northeast swept the pack ice from the area from which they had come solidly around the ship.</ref><ref name="Shackleton_South"/>

In May, the Antarctic sun set for the last time before winter, and ''Endurance'' kept its position until spring in the hope that warmer weather would free the vessel from the ice. When spring arrived, however, the breaking of the ice and subsequent movement of giant ice floes splintered the ship's hull.<ref name="Worsley_Endurance">Worsley (1999), ''Endurance: An Epic of Polar Adventure''</ref> Although ''Endurance'' withstood considerable stress, on [[24 October]] she was forced against a large floe, and water began pouring in.<ref>This was reported by Shackleton in ''South'' as well as by sailor Walter How in a later interview included in a film documentary, ''The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition'' (2000).</ref> After a few days, on [[27 October]], Shackleton gave the abandon-ship order, and on [[21 November]] [[1915]], ''Endurance'' finally slipped beneath the ice at {{nowrap|69<U+00B0> 00<U+2032> S, 51<U+00B0> 30<U+2032> W.}}<ref name="Shackleton_South"/> To supplement their diet in Antarctica the men ate penguins and seals found in the area.<ref>According to Frank Worsley in ''Shackleton's Boat Journey,'' while stranded on the ice and during the time spent at Elephant Island, the men ate [[Weddell Seal]], [[Crabeater Seal]], and [[Elephant Seal]].</ref> This ceased when the local animals mysteriously disappeared; food became scarce, and the men resorted to eating their dogs.<ref>It was common for men on Antarctic expeditions to eventually consume the meat of their dogs and horses. This was true as well for the expeditions of Amundsen and Scott. Beyond providing sustenance, fresh meat was known to help prevent [[scurvy]]. Like [[citrus fruit]], fresh meat contains significant amounts of [[vitamin C]].</ref>  [[Mrs. Chippy]], the beloved cat of the carpenter, [[Harry McNish]], and the youngest of the pups born during the expedition were shot soon after ''Endurance'' was abandoned because Shackleton did not think they would survive the ordeal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3818613.stm|author=Kim Griggs|publisher=BBC|title=Antarctic hero 'reunited' with cat|date=2004-06-21|accessdate=27 October|accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="Alexander">Alexander,&nbsp;''Endurance''.</ref>

For almost two months, Shackleton and his men camped on an ice floe hoping that it would drift towards [[Paulet Island]] approximately {{convert|400|km|mi|-1}} away. On [[23 December]] Shackleton decided to start sledging towards the island. However, because of the constantly changing sea ice, the party only managed to march a few miles in a week before deciding to set up another more permanent camp (Patience Camp) on another floe and trust to the drift of the pack ice to take them in the right direction. By [[5 March]], their ice camp came close to Paulet Island but, separated by impassable ice, they were unable to reach the island as the floe continued to drift north.<ref name="Alexander" />

On [[9 April]] the ice floe that they were camped on broke into two, and Shackleton decided that the crew should enter the lifeboats and head for land. The question presented to the party was where to go. Shackleton decided to lead the crew to [[Deception Island]], about {{convert|320|km|mi|-1}} away.<ref name="Shackleton_South"><ref> A possible benefit of volcanic Deception Island, although not mentioned by Shackleton in ''South'', would have been the luxury of geothermally-heated water. Deception Island is often seen as a highlight of Antarctic cruises as people routinely swim in the warm water of Pendulum Cove while avoiding places where the water is scalding hot. The island's volcano last erupted in 1969. (See [http://www.deceptionisland.aq/ "Deception Island".])</ref> However, after a few days in the boats, the crew members realised that their scarce resources would not allow them to make that journey. On [[April 12]] Shackleton discussed with his crew the possibility of reaching [[Hope Bay]] on the continent, now only {{convert|130|km|mi}} distant.  However, ice conditions were treacherous and after another night the men looked "seriously worn and strained".<ref name="Shackleton_South"/> Shackleton realised the closer [[Elephant Island]] was the only option. After seven days at sea in the three small lifeboats, the men landed at Elephant Island.<ref name="Shackleton_South"/>

====Voyage of the ''James Caird''====
[[Image:LaunchingTheJamesCaird2.jpg|thumb|right|Launching the ''[[James Caird (boat)|James Caird]]'' from the shore of [[Elephant Island]], [[24 April]] [[1916]]]]
Elephant Island was an inhospitable place far from any shipping routes and thus a poor location to await rescue. Consequently, Shackleton felt it essential that he set out to find help immediately upon arrival, and to him, it was obvious that he must head back to South Georgia, even if it meant traversing {{convert|1287|km|mi|-2}} of open ocean in one of the lifeboats. The lifeboat ''[[James Caird (boat)|James Caird]]'' was chosen for the trip. To prepare for the journey, Shackleton chose his strongest sailors to accompany him, [[John Vincent (sailor)|John Vincent]] and [[Timothy McCarthy (sailor)|Timothy McCarthy]], as well as experienced officer [[Thomas Crean]]. Shackleton also selected the expedition's carpenter, [[Harry McNish]], who immediately made improvements to the open lifeboat. Morrell argues that Shackleton choose McNish and Vincent to accompany him not only for their talent and toughness, but also because they were noted malcontents. He did not want the atmosphere on Elephant Island to be disrupted. Shackleton had frequently chosen to have the most rebellious crew members close to him, in order to quell discontent amongst the party.<ref name="Way"/><ref>Worsley noted that McNish made various improvements to the vessel, including raising its sides, strengthening its keel, and building a makeshift deck of wood and canvas, sealing the work with oil paints and seal blood.</ref><ref name="<ref name="Boat_Journey"/> The difficult task of navigating the crossing was left to [[Frank Worsley]]. Ensuring they were on the correct course was of utmost importance as missing their target would certainly have doomed the team.<ref name="Shackleton_South"/>

The waters that Shackleton had to cross in his boat of 6.85&nbsp;m&nbsp;(22.5&nbsp;ft) are among the most treacherous in the world.<ref>Worsley wrote in ''Endurance: An Epic of Polar Adventure'' that it was common to hear phrases among the small crew such as "eight bells" indicating winds and seas of a force-8&nbsp;gale on the [[Beaufort scale]].</ref><ref name="Shackleton_South"/> Weather reports confirm that gale-force winds of {{convert|60|km/h|mph}} to {{convert|70|km/h|mph}} are present in the [[Drake Passage]] between South America and Antarctica on an average of 200&nbsp;days per year; they cause ocean swells of {{convert|6|m|ft|0}}, and Frank Worsley later commented on the poor weather conditions which complicated the task. [[Celestial navigation]] readings were only possible at four times during the 800&nbsp;mile journey. He also noted that waves of {{convert|16|m|ft|0}} were not uncommon.<ref>Worsley wrote of swells of 13&nbsp;metres (43&nbsp;ft) to {{convert|16|m|ft|0}} that crest-to-crest were {{convert|800|m|ft|0|}} apart and were moving at {{convert|40|km/h|mph|0}}; these could strike at {{convert|80|km/h|mph|0}}.</ref> Of one hair-raising moment of the journey, Shackleton wrote:

{{quotation|At midnight I was at the tiller and suddenly noticed a line of clear sky between the south and south-west. I called to the other men that the sky was clearing, and then a moment later I realised that what I had seen was not a rift in the clouds but the white crest of an enormous wave. During twenty-six years' experience of the ocean in all its moods I had not encountered a wave so gigantic. It was a mighty upheaval of the ocean, a thing quite apart from the big white-capped seas that had been our tireless enemies for many days. I shouted, "For God's sake, hold on! It's got us!" Then came a moment of suspense that seemed drawn out into hours. White surged the foam of the breaking sea around us. We felt our boat lifted and flung forward like a cork in breaking surf. We were in a seething chaos of tortured water; but somehow the boat lived through it, half-full of water, sagging to the dead weight and shuddering under the blow. We baled with the energy of men fighting for life, flinging the water over the sides with every receptacle that came to our hands, and after ten minutes of uncertainty we felt the boat renew her life beneath us.|Ernest Shackleton|South}}

Shackleton had refused to pack supplies for more than four weeks, knowing that if they did not reach land by that time the boat would be lost. And indeed, after 14&nbsp;days, the crew was within sight of [[Cave Cove]], [[South Georgia]]. To avoid a night landing on an unfamiliar shore Shackleton ordered the boat to sit out at sea until first light, during which time a storm with hurricane-force winds blew up. After battling against the storm for nine hours they were finally able to land.<ref>Worsley later wrote that a 500-ton steamer en route from [[Buenos Aires]] to South Georgia had foundered in the same storm with all aboard lost.</ref> Leaving McNish, Vincent and McCarthy at the landing point on South Georgia, Shackleton travelled with Worsley and Crean over mountainous terrain for 36&nbsp;hours to [[Stromness (South Georgia)|Stromness]]. No man had previously been able to venture more than {{convert|1|km|mi|1}} inland on the island.<ref name="Rubin"/> Staggering into Stromness, Shackleton and his team were welcomed into the whaling manager's house.<ref name="Boat_Journey">Worsley (1998), ''Shackleton's Boat Journey''</ref>

[[Image:AllSafeAllWell.jpg|thumb|left|Shackleton returned to Elephant Island in August 1916, and found that all 22&nbsp;men left behind had survived. The original nitrate photo of the departure of the ''James Caird'' was altered by photographer [[Frank Hurley]] to illustrate the return of Shackleton.<ref name="Hurley">Hurley,&nbsp; page&nbsp;196</ref>]]

====Rescue====
Shackleton's first three attempts to rescue his men on Elephant Island failed.  Desperate, he finally appealed to the [[Chile]]an government, which offered the help of ''Yelcho'', a small seagoing [[tugboat|tug]] from its navy. ''Yelcho'' reached Elephant Island on [[30 August]], and Shackleton, in a quick operation, evacuated all 22&nbsp;men, who had been stranded for 105&nbsp;days.<ref name="Rubin"/> Meanwhile, the [[Ross Sea Party]] was still stranded at [[Cape Evans]] on [[Ross Island]] because ''Aurora'' had been stuck in ice for 10&nbsp;months and could not reach them. Shackleton met ''Aurora'' in New Zealand and returned to rescue the Ross Sea Party. Although every member of the Weddell Sea Party that Shackleton had led survived,<ref>[[Perce Blackborow]] had to have his frostbitten toes amputated while on Elephant Island.</ref> three members of the Ross Sea Party lost their lives.<ref name="PBS"/><ref name="Rubin"/>

===World War I===
Shackleton returned to England in May 1917, while [[Europe]] was in the midst of the [[First World War]].  He suffered from a heart condition, most likely made worse by the fatigue of his arduous journeys.  He was too old to be conscripted, but nevertheless he volunteered for the army, repeatedly requesting to be sent to the front in France as a transport captain. Instead he was sent to [[Buenos Aires]] to boost British propaganda in South America. Unqualified as a diplomat, he unsuccessfully tried to persuade Argentina and Chile to enter the war on the side of the Allies.  He returned home in 1918.<ref name="Speake"/>

Shackleton was then asked to be the leader of a mission to [[Spitsbergen]], an island above the [[Arctic Circle]] and to the north of [[Norway]], in order to establish a British presence there in the guise of a mining operation. However, in [[Troms<U+00F8>]], Shackleton suffered a heart attack and had to return.  Despite this, he joined a military expedition to [[Murmansk]], [[Russia]], in the autumn of 1918; however the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|Armistice]] was signed on [[11 November]] [[1918]], two weeks after he landed in Russia, and Shackleton returned home to publish the book ''South'', about the ''Endurance'' expedition.<ref name="Rainey">Rainey,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;137</ref>

===Shackleton-Rowett Expedition and death (1921<U+2013>22)===
{{main|Shackleton-Rowett Expedition}}
[[Image:South Georgia Ernest Shackleton grave in Grytviken.jpg|thumb|left|Sir Ernest Shackleton's grave in [[Grytviken]], [[South Georgia]]]]
Despite the events of the ''Endurance'' expedition, Shackleton set out again for the Antarctic aboard ''Quest'' intending circumnavigate Antarctica by sea. Although some of his former crew members had not received all of their pay from the ''Endurance'' expedition, many of them signed on with their former "Boss". However, when the party arrived in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Shackleton fell ill after a heart attack. Even so, he refused to return the ship to England or seek treatment, and ''Quest'' continued south.<ref name="Speake"/>

On [[4 January]] [[1922]], the ship arrived off the coast of South Georgia. In the early morning hours, the expedition's physician, [[Alexander Macklin]], was called to Shackleton's cabin and noticed that he was ill. Macklin suggested to Shackleton that he "take things easier in the future", to which the reply was: "You are always wanting me to give up something, what do you want me to give up now?"<ref>Mickleburgh,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;95</ref>

These would be the last words spoken by Sir Ernest Shackleton.  A few moments later, at 2:50&nbsp;a.m. on [[5 January]] [[1922]], he suffered a fatal heart attack. He was 47. Macklin, who conducted the autopsy, concluded that the cause of death was [[atheroma]] of the coronary arteries exacerbated by "overstrain during a period of debility".<ref name="Alexander" /> [[Leonard Hussey]], a veteran of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic expedition, offered to return his body to Britain; however, while he was in [[Montevideo]] en route to England, a message was received from Shackleton's wife asking that her husband be buried in South Georgia.  Hussey returned with the body, and on [[5 March]] [[1922]], Ernest Shackleton was buried at [[Grytviken]].<ref name="Wheeler">Wheeler,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;11</ref>

==Legacy==

Although Shackleton was not immediately recognised for his achievements after the ''Endurance'' expedition, in later years his exploits have been the focus of many books, television shows, charities, and memorials. Among these are the James Caird Society, organised in 1994, which was set up to preserve the memory of Shackleton and his achievements. The society is named after Shackleton's benefactor, who was also honoured by the naming of the 6.85&nbsp;m&nbsp;(22.5&nbsp;ft) lifeboat used to travel between Elephant Island and South Georgia. Its first life president was Shackleton's younger son, [[Edward Shackleton]], and his granddaughter, Alexandra Shackleton, has been life president since 1995. The ''James Caird'' itself is at [[Dulwich College]] in [[London]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dulwich.org.uk/OA_Document_1.aspx?doc=1:26848&id=1:29465&id=1:29454&id=1:29431 |publisher=Dulwich College |title=Sir Ernest Shackelton |accessdate=2008-01-30}}</ref>

Additionally, Sir Ernest Shackleton is the subject of ''[[Shackleton (film)|Shackleton]]'', a two-part [[Channel 4]] drama directed by [[Charles Sturridge]] and starring [[Kenneth Branagh]] as the explorer. The same story is related in greater detail in the book ''[[Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage]]'', by [[Alfred Lansing]] and Shackleton is also the subject of a documentary, ''[[The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition]]'', produced and directed in 2000 by [[George Butler (filmmaker)|George Butler]] and narrated by [[Liam Neeson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272839/ |title=Shackleton (2002)(TV)|accessdate=2007-12-27 |work=Internet Movie Database}}</ref>

Shackleton's grave, near the former whaling station at [[Grytviken]] on South Georgia, is frequently visited by tourists from passing cruise ships.  The [[British Antarctic Survey]]'s logistics vessel [[RRS Ernest Shackleton|RRS ''Ernest Shackleton'']] (the replacement for [[RRS Bransfield|RRS ''Bransfield'']]) is named in his honour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/living_and_working/research_ships/rrs_ernest_shackleton/index.php |title=RRS Ernest Shackleton, Research Ship |accessdate=2007-12-27 |work=British Antarctic Survey}}</ref> In May 1998 the Shackleton Memorial Library opened at the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/library/ |title=RRS Ernest Shackleton, Research Ship |accessdate=2007-12-27 |work=Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge}}</ref>  He is commemorated with a statue outside the [[Lowther Lodge|headquarters of the Royal Geographical Society]] in Kensington, London, designed by the sculptor [[Charles Sargeant Jagger]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/images/image/1624-popup.html |title=Victoria & Albert |accessdate=2008-01-30|work=Architecture Trails, Kensington}}</ref> In recent years interest in Shackleton has revived, and he has become an icon of successful leadership for some modern business writers, who have published books extolling his leadership style.<ref name="Perkins"/> Lastly, Shackleton's death is considered the end of the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]], a period of discovery characterized by adventurers travelling to the South Pole, largely on their own without radio communication.<ref>Hince,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;227.</ref>

===Expedition advertisement===
The following advertisement is said to have appeared in ''[[The Times]]'' to recruit crew members for one of Shackleton's expeditions: 

{{quotation|Men Wanted: For hazardous journey. Small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in case of success.|Sir Ernest Shackleton.<ref name="Watkins">Watkins, p.&nbsp;1</ref>}}

Although the advertisement has been widely attributed to Shackleton, its existence in ''The Times'' or other contemporary London sources has not been confirmed.<ref>The [http://www.antarctic-circle.org/advert.htm Antarctic Circle] forum in 2001 offered a $100 prize for anyone able to find the original advertisement. As of January 2008, no one had won the prize.</ref>
