'''Siward Barn''' ({{lang-ang|Sigeweard Bearn}}) was an 11th century [[Anglo-Saxons|English]] [[thegn]] and landowner-warrior. He appears in the extant sources in the period following the [[Norman Conquest of England]], joining the northern resistance to [[William the Conqueror]] by the end of the 1060s. Siward's resistance continued until his capture on the [[Isle of Ely]] alongside [[<U+00C6>thelwine (Bishop of Durham)|<U+00C6>thelwine]], [[Bishop of Durham]], [[Morcar|Earl Morcar]], and [[Hereward]] ("the Wake"). Siward and his confiscated properties in central and northern [[England]] were mentioned in ''[[Domesday Book]]'', and from this it is clear that he was one of the main ''antecessors'' of [[Henry de Ferrers]], father of [[Robert de Ferrers, 1st Earl of Derby|Robert de Ferrers]], the first [[Earl of Derby]].

Following his capture in 1071, he was imprisoned. This incarceration lasted until 1087, when a guilt-ridden King William, in expectation of his own death, ordered Siward's release. Firm evidence of Siward's later life is non-existent, but some historians have argued that he took up a career in the [[Varangian Guard]] at [[Constantinople]], in the service of the Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]]. The sources upon which this theory is based also allege that Siward led a party of English colonists to the [[Black Sea]], who renamed their conquered territory [[New England (medieval)|New England]].  

==Origins==
Identifying Siward's origin is difficult for historians because of the large number of Siwards in England in the mid-11th century. Other notable Siwards include Siward of Maldon and Siward Grossus, both men of substance with landholdings larger or comparable to Siward Barn's.<ref>Clarke, ''English Nobility'', pp. 32&ndash;3</ref> The [[Anglo-Norman]] writer [[Orderic Vitalis]], when describing [[William the Conqueror]]'s stay at [[Barking]], says that [[Morcar of Northumbria|Morcar]], formerly [[Earl of Northumbria]], and [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwine]], [[Earl of Mercia]], came and submitted to King William, followed by Copsi, Earl of Northumbria, along with Thurkil of Limis, [[Eadric the Wild]], and "Ealdred and Siward, the sons of <U+00C6>thelgar, grandsons [or grand-nephews] (''pronepotes'') of King Edward".<ref>Chibnall (ed.), ''Ecclesiastical History'', vol. ii, p. 195</ref> 

[[Edward Augustus Freeman]] and other historians have thought that this Siward was Siward Barn, arguing that Siward must have been a descendant of [[Uhtred the Bold]], Earl of Northumbria, and <U+00C6>lfgifu, daughter of King [[Ethelred the Unready|<U+00C6>thelred the Unready]], King Edward's father.<ref>For some citations, see Chibnall (ed.), ''Ecclesiastical History'', vol. ii, p. 194, n. 4</ref> Historian and translator of Orderic, [[Marjorie Chibnall]], pointed out that this Siward is mentioned later in his ''Ecclesiastical History'' as a [[Shropshire]] landowner, in connection with the foundation of [[Shrewsbury Abbey]].<ref>Chibnall (ed.), ''Ecclesiastical History'', vol. ii, p. 194&ndash;5, n. 4,</ref> [[Ann Williams (historian)|Ann Williams]] likewise rejected this identification, identifying this Siward firmly with the Shropshire thegn Siward Grossus.<ref>Williams, ''The English'', pp. 8, 89&ndash;6, 175&ndash;6; she does not call him "Grossus", but this is the nickname used by Clarke, ''English Nobility'', pp. 339&ndash;40 et passim</ref> According to Williams' reconstruction, Siward Grossus and his brother Ealdred were the sons of <U+00C6>thelgar by a daughter of [[Eadric Streona]], [[Ealdorman of Mercia]] and Eadgyth, another daughter of King <U+00C6>thelred, explaining the relationship Orderic believed they had with Edward the Confessor.<ref>See, especially, table vi, Williams, ''The English'', p. 91</ref>

Another historian, Forrest Scott, guessed that Siward was a member of the family of Northumbrian earls, presumably connected in some way to [[Siward, Earl of Northumbria]].<ref>Scott, "Earl Waltheof", p. 172</ref> Margaret Faull and Marie Stinson, the editors of the Philimore ''[[Domesday Book]]'' for [[Yorkshire]], believed that Siward was "a senior member of the house of Bamburgh and possibly a brother or half-brother of [[Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria|Earl Gospatric]]".<ref>Faull and Stinson, ''Domesday Book: Yorkshire'', part ii, s.v. "SIGVARTHBARN", page number not marked, but in appendix, section 4 "Biographies of Tenants: English"</ref> Another historian, [[Geoffrey Barrow]], pointed out that Faull and Stinson gave no evidence for this assertion, and doubted the hypothesis because of Siward's Danish name.<ref>Barrow, "Companions of the Atheling", p. 40</ref>

==From York to Ely==

[[Image:River Thames near lechlade.JPG|thumb|River Thames and modern Lechlade, the location of Siward's Gloucestershire estate]]
In 1068, there was a revolt in the north of England against the rule of King William, few details of which are recorded.<ref>Green, ''Aristocracy'', p. 102</ref> It was serious enough to worry King William, who marched north and began the construction of castles at [[Warwick]], [[Nottingham]], [[York]], [[Lincoln]], [[Huntingdon]] and [[Cambridge]].<ref>Fleming, ''Kings and Lords'', p. 165</ref>
Earl Cospatric apparently fled to Scotland and in the beginning of 1069 King William appointed the [[Picardy|Picard]] [[Robert de Comines]] as the new earl of Northumbria.<ref>Fleming, ''Kings and Lords'', p. 166; Green, ''Aristocracy'', p. 102</ref> 

During the winter the English murdered Earl William and Robert fitz Richard, the custodian of the new castle at [[York]], and trapped [[William Malet (Norman conquest)|William Malet]], the first Norman [[sheriff]] of York, in the castle.<ref>Fleming, ''Kings and Lords'', p. 166; Green, ''Aristocracy'', p. 103</ref> King William went north in the spring or summer of 1069, relieved the siege of Malet, and restored the castle, placing William fitz Osbern in charge.<ref>Fleming, ''Kings and Lords'', p. 166; Green, ''Aristocracy'', p. 103; Kapelle, ''Norman Conquest'', p. 114</ref> The leaders of the revolt were [[Edgar the <U+00C6>theling]] (claimant to the English throne), Gospatric of Northumbria, and, among others, M<U+00E6>rle-Sveinn, former sheriff of Lincoln, and many senior Northumbria nobles.<ref>Fleming, ''Kings and Lords'', p. 166</ref>  

In the autumn of 1069, a fleet under the Danish king [[Sweyn Estridsson]] and his brother Earl Osbjorn arrived off the coast of England,.<ref>Douglas and Greenway (eds.), ''English Historical Documents'', vol. ii, p. 155; Kapelle, ''Norman Conquest'', p. 114</ref> It is from this point that Siward's involvement in the revolt is documented. [[Orderic Vitalis]] related that:<blockquote>The <U+00C6>theling, [[Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria|Waltheof]], Siward, and the other English leaders had joined the Danes ... The Danes reached York, and a general rising of the inhabitants swelled their ranks. Waltheof, Gospatric (''Gaius Patricius''), M<U+00E6>rle-Sveinn (''Marius Suenus''), Elnoc, Arnketil, and the four sons of Karle were in the advance guard and led the Danish and Norwegian forces.<ref>Chibnall (ed.), ''Ecclesiastical History'', vol. ii, pp. 226&ndash;9</ref></blockquote> 

What followed was William's most devastating punitive expedition, the so-called "Harrying of the North", conducted during the winter of 1069/70.<ref>Kapelle, ''Norman Conquest'', p. 119</ref> After two minor engagements disadvantageous to the Danes, King William came to an agreement with Earl Osbjorn that neutralised them.<ref>Kapelle, ''Norman Conquest'', p. 117</ref> William held Christmas court at the ruined city of York, and brought Waltheof and Gospatric back into his peace at the [[river Tees]].<ref>Green, ''Aristocracy'', pp. 103&ndash;4</ref> 

Siward was at [[Wearmouth]] in the summer of 1070, with Edgar and M<U+00E6>rle-Sveinn, while William marched to the [[river Tyne]] with his marauding army. Although William burnt down the church of [[Jarrow]], he left Edgar's party undisturbed.<ref>Kapelle, ''Norman Conquest'', p. 125; Williams, ''The English'', p. 39</ref> Siward must have gone to [[Scotland]] in this year, for the ''[[Historia Regum]]'' reports that in 1071 Morcar (previously earl of Northumbria) and [[Hereward]] went by ship to the Isle of Ely, and that "[[<U+00C6>thelwine (Bishop of Durham)|<U+00C6>thelwine]], [[bishop of Durham]], and Siward, nicknamed Barn, sailing back from Scotland" arrived there too.<ref>Arnold (ed.), ''Opera Omnia'', vol. i, p. 195; Stevenson, ''Simeon of Durham'', p. 142</ref> This is also related by the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', which confirms that:<blockquote>Bishop <U+00C6>thelwine and Siweard Bearn came to Ely and many hundred men with them".<ref>Douglas and Greenway (eds.), ''English Historical Documents'', vol. ii, p. 159</ref></blockquote> It was at Ely that Siward and all the other notables, save Hereward, were captured by King William.<ref>Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', p. 93, n. 2; Green, ''Aristocracy'', pp. 105&ndash;6; Williams, ''The English'', pp. 55&ndash;7</ref>

==Confiscation and release==
By 1086, perhaps soon before or after his capture, many of Siward's lands were given to the Norman warrior [[Henry de Ferrers]], though other successors included Geoffrey de La Guerche and William d'Ecouis.<ref>Fleming, ''Kings and Lords'', pp. 163, 176, n. 165; Williams and Martin (eds.), ''Domesday Book'', pp. 953&ndash;4, 1140</ref> According to the ''Domesday Book'', in "the time of Edward" (TRE), or rather on the day of the death of [[Edward the Confessor]], Siward held twenty-one manors in eight different English counties.<ref name=Clarkelist>List and table of property given, Clarke, ''English Nobility'', pp. 338&ndash;9</ref> 

In Berkshire, [[Greenham]] (<U+00A3>8), [[Lockinge]] (<U+00A3>10) and [[Stanford in the Vale]] (<U+00A3>30; now in [[Oxfordshire]]); in [[Gloucestershire]], [[Lechlade]] (<U+00A3>20); in Warwickshire, [[Grendon, Warwickshire|Grendon]] (<U+00A3>2), [[Burton Hastings]] (<U+00A3>4) and [[Harbury]] (<U+00A3>2); in [[Derbyshire]], [[Brassington]] (<U+00A3>6), [[Croxhall]] (<U+00A3>3), [[Catton, Derbyshire|Catton]] (<U+00A3>3), [[Cubley, Derbyshire|Cubley]] (<U+00A3>5), [[Norbury]] and [[Roston]] (<U+00A3>5), [[Duffield]] (<U+00A3>9), Breadhall (<U+00A3>4), "Wormhill" (waste) and [[Moreley]] (waste); in [[Nottinghamshire]], [[East Leake|Leake]] (<U+00A3>6) and [[Bonnington, Nottinghamshire|Bonnington]] (s. 6); in [[Yorkshire]] [[Adlingfleet]] (<U+00A3>4); in [[Lincolnshire]], [[Whitton, North Lincolnshire|Whitton]] (<U+00A3>10) and [[Haxey]] (5); and in [[Norfolk]] [[Sheringham]] (<U+00A3>4) and [[Salthouse]] (<U+00A3>2).<ref name=Clarkelist/> Ann Williams doubted that the estates in Berkshire belonged to Siward Barn, noting the possibility that these estates belonged to Siward of Maldon.<ref>Williams, ''The English'', p. 34, n. 72</ref>

The total value of his holdings is put at 142 libra ("pounds") and 6 solidi ("shillings").<ref>Clarke, ''English Nobility'', p. 339</ref> Siward Barn ranks 21st out of all the English landowners in the time of King Edward below the rank of earl.<ref>Clarke, ''English Nobility'', p. 38</ref>

Nothing more is heard of Siward until 1087, the year of the death of William the Conqueror. The ''Chronicle'' of [[John of Worcester]] relates that:<blockquote>On his [King William's] return [from France] fierce intestinal pains afflicted him, and he got worse from day to day. When, as his illness worsened, he felt the day of his death approaching, he set free his brother, [[Odo of Bayeux|Odo]], [[bishop of Bayeux]], earls Morkar and Roger, Siward called ''Barn'', and [[Wulfnoth]], [[Harold Godwinson|King Harold]]'s brother (whom he had kept in custody since childhood), as well as all he had kept imprisoned either in England or Normandy. Then he handed the English kingdom over to [[William Rufus|William]] [Rufus], and granted the Norman duchy to [[Robert Curthose|Robert]] [Curthose], who was then exiled in France. In this way, fortified by the holy [[viaticum]], he abandoned both life and kingdom on Thursday, 9 September, after ruling the English kingdom for twenty years, ten months, and twenty-eight days.<ref>McGurk (ed.), ''The Chronicle of John of Worcester'', vol. iii, p. 47</ref></blockquote> A similar account is in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', recension E, though specific names are omitted.<ref>McGurk (ed.), ''The Chronicle of John of Worcester'', vol. iii, p. 46, n. 7</ref> This unfortunately is also the last notice of Siward in any near-contemporary, reliable source.<ref>Williams, ''The English'', p. 34</ref> 

==Varangian and colonist?==
{{main|New England (medieval)}}
[[File:Skylitzis Chronicle iLLUMINATION.jpg|thumb|250px|Varangian guards depicted in an illumination from the ''Skylitzis Chronicle''; Siward is thought by a few historians to have become a Varangian after being released by the dying King William]]
Two modern historians, however, have argued that Siward subsequently became a [[mercenary]] in the service of the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Alexios I Komnenos]].<ref>Fell, "Anglo-Saxon Emigration to Byzantium", pp. 184&ndash;5; Shepard, "English and Byzantium", pp. 82&ndash;3; see also, below</ref> A 13th century French [[chronicle]] known as the ''Chronicon Laudunensis'' (or ''Chronicon universale anonymi Laudunensis'', "the anonymous universal chronicle of [[Laon]]") and the 14th century [[Iceland]]ic text, the ''[[J<U+00E1>tvar<U+00F0>ar Saga]]'', a short [[saga]] devoted to the life of Edward the Confessor, both relate a story about English warriors who sail to Constantinople in order to escape the dominion of the Normans, and found a colony in the [[Black Sea]] called [[New England (medieval)|New England]].<ref>Ciggaar, "L'<U+00C9>migration Anglaise", pp. 301&ndash;2; Fell, "Anglo-Saxon Emigration to Byzantium", pp. 179&ndash;82; ''J<U+00E1>tvar<U+00F0>ar Saga'' is translated in Dasent, ''Icelandic Sagas'', vol. iii, pp. 416&ndash;28, reprinted Ciggaar, "L'<U+00C9>migration Anglaise", pp. 340&ndash;2; the relevant portion of the ''Chronicon Laudunensis'' is printed in Ciggaar, "L'<U+00C9>migration Anglaise", pp. 320&ndash;3</ref> The ''J<U+00E1>tvar<U+00F0>ar Saga'' says that the leader of this expedition was one "Siward earl of Gloucester" (''Sigur<U+00F0> jarl af Glocestr'').<ref>Dasent, ''Icelandic Sagas'', vol. iii, pp. 425&ndash;6</ref> 

Siward and his force were said to have rescued Constantinople from a siege by "heathens", after which the emperor Alexios offered Siward and his men positions in the [[Varangian Guard]].<ref>Dasent, ''Icelandic Sagas'', vol. iii, pp. 426<U+2013>7</ref>According to both sources, Siward and some of the English expressed their desire to have a territory of their own, and so Alexius told them of a land over the sea that had formerly been part of the empire, but was now occupied by heathens.<ref name=C322-D427>Ciggaar, "L'<U+00C9>migration Anglaise", p. 322; Dasent, ''Icelandic Sagas'', vol. iii, p. 427</ref> The emperor subsequently granted this land to the English, and a party led by Earl Siward sailed onwards to take control of it.<ref name=C322-D427/> The land, the sources allege, lay "6 days north and north-east of Constantinople", a distance and direction that puts the territory somewhere in or around the [[Crimea]] and [[Sea of Azov]].<ref>Dasent, Icelandic Sagas, vol. iii, pp. 427&ndash;8; see also Ciggaar, "L'<U+00C9>migration Anglaise", pp. 322&ndash;3, and Shepard, "Another New England?", passim</ref> Earl Siward, after many battles, defeated and drove away the heathens.<ref name=Dasent-427-8>Dasent, Icelandic Sagas, vol. iii, pp. 427&ndash;8</ref> The ''Chronicon Laudunensis'' says that this territory was renamed "New England",<ref name=Cigaar-323>Ciggaar, "L'<U+00C9>migration Anglaise", p. 323</ref> while the ''J<U+00E1>tvar<U+00F0>ar Saga'' claims that the towns of the land were named after English towns, including London and York.<ref name=Dasent-427-8/> The ''Chronicon'' alleges that, later, the English rebelled against Byzantine authority and became pirates.<ref name=Cigaar-323/>
 
The theory that this Siward is Siward Barn was advocated by [[Jonathan Shepard]] and Christine Fell.<ref>Fell, "Anglo-Saxon Emigration to Byzantium", pp. 184&ndash;5; Godfrey, "The Defeated Anglo-Saxons", p. 69; Shepard, "English and Byzantium", pp. 82&ndash;3</ref> Shepard pointed out, although never called "Earl of Gloucester", Siward had holdings in Gloucestershire <U+2014> the only substantial Siward in ''Domesday Book'' with property in that county <ref>See Clarke, ''English Nobility'', pp. 338&ndash;42</ref> <U+2014> and was indeed a participant in resistance to the Normans.<ref>Shepard, "English and Byzantium", pp. 82&ndash;3</ref> Shepard argued that the narrative in question referred not, as the ''Chronicon Laudunensis'' had asserted, to the 1070s, but to the 1090s, after Siward's release from prison.<ref>Shepard, "English and Byzantium", pp. 83&ndash;4</ref> Fell, while acknowledging that there were two Siwards participating in resistance to William the Conqueror, Siward Barn and Siward of Maldon, pointed out that Siward Barn is more prominent in the literary sources and, unlike Siward of Maldon, had property in Gloucestershire.<ref>Fell, "Anglo-Saxon Emigration to Byzantium", pp. 184&ndash;5</ref> Two other historians who have since commented on the point, John Godfrey and Ann Williams, accepted that the identification is tenuous and remained neutral.<ref>Godfrey, "The Defeated Anglo-Saxons", p. 69; Williams, ''The English'', p. 34, n. 71</ref>
