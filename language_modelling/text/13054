The '''Seventh Ottoman<U+2013>Venetian War''' was fought between the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] between 1714 and 1718. It was the last conflict between the two powers, and ended with an Ottoman victory and the loss of Venice's major possession in the Greek peninsula, the [[Peloponnese]] ([[Morea]]). Venice was saved from a greater defeat by the intervention of [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] in 1716. The Austrian victories led to the signing of the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] in 1718, which ended the war.
This war was also called the '''Second Morean War''',<ref name=Lane411>Lane (1973), p. 411</ref> the '''Small War''' or, in [[Croatia]], the '''War of [[Sinj]]'''.<ref>[http://www.matica.hr/www/wwwizd2.nsf/AllWebDocs/soldosinjskakrajinau17i18stoljecu1 Matica hrvatska] Josip Ante Soldo: Sinjska krajina u 17. i 18. stolje<U+0107>u (knjiga prva), Matica hrvatska ogranak Sinj, Sinj, 1995, ISBN 953-96429-0-6</ref>

== Background ==

{{details|Morean War}}
In the [[Great Turkish War]] (1684<U+2013>1699) the Ottoman Empire was forced to make several territorial concessions to Austria and Venice, including the Morea peninsula. The Ottomans were determined to reverse these losses, and Venice, as the weaker of the two, was chosen as the first target. The time was judged as ripe in 1714: the Ottomans had just emerged from a [[Russo<U+2013>Turkish War (1710<U+2013>1711)|successful conflict]] with [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and Austria was embroiled in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].{{cn|date=December 2012}}

== The Ottoman conquest of the Morea ==

The Ottomans declared war on 9 December 1714, using some transgressions of Venetian merchants as a pretext. During the early months of 1715, they assembled an army of ca. 70,000 men in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] under the [[Grand Vizier]] [[Silahdar Damat Ali Pasha]]. The Grand Vizier marched south, reaching the main camp in [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] in early June. In the meantime, the Ottoman Fleet, numbering 80 warships under Canum Hoca, had captured the last Venetian possessions in the Aegean, the islands of [[Tinos]] and [[Aigina]].<ref>Finlay, p. 264</ref>

The Venetians, who did not have any standing army and relied mainly on mercenaries, could only muster 8,000 men and 42 mostly small ships, under the command of the Captain General Geronimo Delphino.<ref>Finlay, p.265</ref> This force was not only insufficient to meet the Ottoman army in the field, but also inadequate to man the many fortifications that the Venetians had built or enhanced during the past decades. In addition, the local Greek population disliked Venetian rule, something Damad Ali exploited, by ensuring that his troops respected their safety and property. Thus he was able to count on the good will of the Greeks, who provided his troops with ample provisions,<ref name=Stavrianos>L.S. Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'', p. 181</ref> while the Venetians, who hoped to recruit a militia amongst the native population, were left isolated in their forts.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

On 25 June, the Ottoman army crossed the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] and entered the Peloponnese. The citadel of [[Acrocorinth]], which controlled the passage to the peninsula, surrendered after a brief siege, on terms of safe passage for the garrison and the civilians. However, some [[Janissaries]], eager for plunder, disobeyed Damat Ali's orders and entered the citadel. A large part of the garrison, including the ''provedditore'' Giacomo Minoto, and most of the civilians were massacred or sold to [[Slavery (Ottoman Empire)|slavery]]. Only 180 Venetians were saved and transported to [[Corfu]].<ref>Finlay, pp.266<U+2013>268</ref> These tragic events later inspired [[Lord Byron]]'s poem ''[[The Siege of Corinth (poem)|The Siege of Corinth]]''.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

After Corinth, the Ottomans advanced against [[Nafplion]] (''Napoli di Romagna''), the main base of Venetian power in the Morea. Nafplion was well-protected by several strong forts and had a garrison of 2,000 men. However, on 20 July, after only nine days of siege, the Ottomans exploded a [[Mining (military)|mine]] under the bastions of [[Palamidi]] and successfully stormed the fort. The Venetian defenders panicked and retreated, leading to a general collapse of the defence.<ref>Finlay, pp.270<U+2013>271</ref>

The Ottomans then advanced to the southwest, where the forts of [[Pylos|Navarino]] and [[Koroni]] were abandoned by the Venetians, who gathered their remaining forces at [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]] (''Modon''). However, being denied effective support from the sea by Delfino's reluctance to endanger his fleet by engaging the Ottoman navy, the fort capitulated.<ref>Finlay, pp.272<U+2013>274</ref> The remaining Venetian strongholds, including the last remaining outposts on [[Crete]] ([[Spinalonga]] and [[Souda Island|Souda]]), likewise capitulated in exchange for safe departure. Within a hundred days, the entire Peloponnese had been re-taken by the Ottomans.<ref name=Stavrianos/>

== The Siege of Corfu ==

[[File:Plan Corfou 1688.jpg|thumb|right|200px|City plan of Corfu in 1688, depicting its fortifications]]
After their success in the Morea, the Ottomans moved against the Venetian-held [[Ionian Islands]]. They occupied the island of [[Lefkada]] (''Santa Maura''), which the Venetians had taken in 1684, and the fort of [[Buthrotum|Butrinto]] opposite the [[Corfu (city)|city of Corfu]]. On 8 July 1716, an Ottoman army of 33,000 men landed on [[Corfu]], the most important of the Ionian islands.<ref name="AD 1716">J. Norwich, ''A History of Venice'', 579</ref> Despite an indecisive [[Action of July 8, 1716|naval battle on the same day]], the Ottoman land army continued its disembarkment and advanced towards the city of Corfu. On 19 July, after capturing the outlying forts of Mantouki, Garitsa, Avrami and of the Saviour, the siege began.<ref name=Corfu1>[http://www.corfuweb.gr/gb-history6.htm The history of Corfu] at corfuweb.gr</ref> The defence was led by Count [[Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg]], who had roughly 8,000 men at his command. The extensive fortifications and the determination of the defenders withstood several assaults. After a great storm on 9 August<U+2014>which the defenders attributed to the intervention of Corfu's patron saint, [[Saint Spyridon]]<U+2014>caused significant casualties among the besiegers, the siege was broken off on 11 August and the last Ottoman forces withdrew on 20 August.<ref name=Corfu1/>

== Austrian intervention and conclusion of the war ==
{{main|Austro-Turkish War of 1716<U+2013>1718}}
In the summer of 1715, the pasha of [[Bosnia]] marched against the Venetian possessions in Dalmatia, with an army that reputedly numbered 40,000 men. The Ottomans were defeated at [[Sinj]], but the Ottoman threat to Dalmatia played a role in Austria's decision to intervene.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

With Pope [[Pope Clement XI|Clement XI]] providing financial support and [[Kingdom of France|France]] guaranteeing Austrian possessions in Italy, Austria felt ready to intervene. On 13 April 1716, Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] renewed his alliance with Venice, whereupon the Ottomans declared war on Austria. The Austrian threat forced the Ottomans to direct their forces away from the remaining Venetian possessions, but the ''Serenissima'' was too weak to mount any large-scale counter-offensive. Only its navy resumed a more aggressive stance, with naval actions between the Venetian and Ottoman fleets taking place in the [[Aegean Sea]], such as the [[Battle of Imbros (1717)|Battle of Imbros]] and the [[Battle of Matapan]] a month later, but these were generally indecisive and did not affect the outcome of the war.<ref name=Lane411/> The only permanent Venetian success was the capture of the fortresses of [[Preveza]] and [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] in 1717. With the Austrian victories at the [[Battle of Petrovaradin]] and the [[Siege of Belgrade (1717)|Siege of Belgrade]], however, the Ottomans were forced to sign the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]]. Although the Ottomans lost significant territories to Austria, they maintained their conquests against Venice in the Peloponnese and Crete, with the exception of Preveza (fell in 1717 to Venetians) and a few forts in [[Herzegovina]] ([[Imotski]] was taken in 1717).{{cn|date=December 2012}}
