'''Pyrrhus' invasion of the Peloponnese''' in 272 BC was an invasion of south Greece by the [[King of Epirus]]. He was opposed by [[Macedon]] and a coalition of [[Greeks|Greek]] [[city-states]] ([[poleis]]), most notably [[Sparta]]. The war ended in a Macedonian and Spartan victory.

After being defeated by the [[Roman Republic]] in the [[Pyrrhic War]] in 275 BC, Pyrrhus ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 297<U+2013>272 BC) decided to turn his attention to [[Greece]]. He declared war on [[Antigonus Gonatas]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 283<U+2013>239 BC) of [[Macedon]] and in a rapid campaign, managed to defeat him and make himself [[King of Macedon]]. In 272 BC, Pyrrhus agreed to assist the disgruntled [[Sparta]]n [[Prince]], [[Cleonymus of Sparta|Cleonymus]], who requested his assistance in securing the Spartan throne.

Pyrrhus advanced with his army through [[Central Greece]] and upon reaching the [[Peloponnese]], he marched against Sparta. The city was sparsely defended at the time as the majority of its army had been taken to [[Crete]] by [[List of kings of Sparta|King]] [[Areus I]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 309<U+2013>265 BC). The Spartans led by [[Crown Prince]] [[Acrotatus II|Acrotatus]] were able to withstand a series of Epiriote assaults until Macedonian reinforcements and Areus' army arrived to relieve the defenders.

Following the arrival of the relieving force, Pyrrhus lifted the siege and prepared to [[winter]] in [[Laconia]]. However, he was approached by an [[Argive]] citizen who requested his assistance in overthrowing the government of [[Argos]]. Seeking to take advantage of the opportunity, Antigonus took his army to Argos, being harried along the way by the Spartans. Whilst attempting to seize Argos by night, Pyrrhus was set upon by his Argive opponents as well as the Spartans and Antigonus' Macedonians. In the ensuing m<U+00EA>l<U+00E9>e, Pyrrhus was slain. His death prompted the capitulation of his army and the reestablishment of a Macedonian [[hegemony]] over Greece.

==Prelude==
[[Image:Pyrrhic War Italy en.svg|thumb|alt=Map depicting the south Adriatic littoral, Sicily and parts of central and southern Italy|Map depicting the campaigns of Pyrrhus in southern Italy and Sicily and the location of the Kingdom of Epirus in Greece]]
Following entreaties from the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[polis]] of [[Taranto|Tarentum]] in 281 BC, [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], the [[King of Epirus]] in northern [[Greece]], invaded [[Italy]] with an army of 25,500 and 20 [[war elephants]].<ref name="Plutarch13-15">{{harvnb|Plutarch|13-15}}.</ref> The aim of the expedition was to combat the aggression of the [[Roman Republic]], which was increasingly annexing the Greek cities of [[Magna Graecia]]. Upon arriving in Italy in 280 BC, Pyrrhus assumed command of an army consisting of the Greeks of Magna Graecia. Adding these forces to his own from Epirus, he engaged and defeated the [[Roman army]] at the [[Battle of Heraclea]], near Tarentum in 280 BC.<ref name="P16-17-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|16-17}}; Wylie, 306.</ref> The Epiriote victory caused a number of native groups such as the [[Samnites]] and the [[Lucanians]], who were also fearful of Roman expansionism to join Pyrrhus.<ref name="P17-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|17}}; Wylie, 306.</ref> Subsequently, Pyrrhus advanced towards [[Rome]] and at the [[Battle of Asculum]] he vanquished another Roman army.<ref name="P21-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|21}}; Wylie, 307.</ref>

Despite having bested the Romans in their battles, Pyrrhus had sustained heavy casualties. With his Italian allies wavering, Pyrrhus decided to abandon his campaign against Rome.<ref name="P21-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|21}}; Wylie, 308.</ref> At this point in time, Pyrrhus had two options available. Firstly, he could return to Greece where the throne of [[Macedon]] had been left vacant by the death of [[King]] [[Ptolemy Keraunos]] at the hands of the [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans|Gallic invaders of Greece]].<ref name="Wylie308">{{harvnb|Wylie|308}}.</ref> Pyrrhus had coveted the Macedonian throne and had briefly held it from 287 BC to 285 BC.<ref name="Hammond229">{{harvnb|Hammond|229}}.</ref> Alternatively, he could respond to the appeal of the Greek poleis of [[Sicily]] which were requesting his assistance to combat [[Carthaginian]] aggression.<ref name="P21-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|21}}; Wylie, 308.</ref>

Ultimately, in 278 BC, Pyrrhus decided to direct his army against the Carthaginians in Sicily.<ref name="Plutarch22">{{harvnb|Plutarch|22}}.</ref> Pyrrhus was highly successful in his campaign against Carthage and by 275 BC had managed to restrict them to the settlement of [[Lilybaeum]] in the far west of the island.<ref name="Wylie308">{{harvnb|Wylie|308}}.</ref> Despite these victories, Pyrrhus' despotic disposition and pretensions alienated his Sicilian allies who began to abandon him.<ref name="P23-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|23}}; Wylie, 309.</ref>  In light of these developments, Pyrrhus decided to return to mainland Italy to continue his war against Rome. The Epiriotes attacked the Roman army but after the inconclusive [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]], he return to Epirus.<ref name="P25-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|25}}; Wylie, 310.</ref> Despite Pyrrhus leaving a [[garrison]] there, Tarentum succumbed to Rome in 272 BC.<ref name="Fox306-307">{{harvnb|Fox|306-307}}.</ref>

==War against Macedon==
[[Image:Antigonus Gonatas British Museum.jpg|thumb|alt=A coin depicting a man with wavy hair|A Macedonian coin depicting King Antigonus II of Macedon ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 283<U+2013>239 BC), who managed to reclaim his kingdom after defeating Pyrrhus.]]
On his return to his homeland, Pyrrhus found himself in a difficult position. His Italian sojourn had emptied his coffers and crippled his army, leaving him reliant on Sicilian mercenaries who required payment.<ref name="P26-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|26}}; Wylie, 311.</ref> In order to secure funds to pay his troops, Pyrrhus planned a war against [[Antigonus II Gonatas]], the new King of Macedon. Citing Antigonus' refusal to provide him with aid during his Italian expedition as a [[casus belli]], Pyrrhus invaded Macedon in the spring of 274 BC. He was accompanied by an army consisting of 8,000 [[infantry]] and 500 [[cavalry]] although their numbers were probably augmented by [[Gauls|Gallic]] mercenaries.<ref name="Hammond260">{{harvnb|Hammond|260}}.</ref> It has been speculated that by invading Macedon, Pyrrhus was acting as the agent of the [[monarch]]s of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]],<ref name="Wylie311">{{harvnb|Wylie|311}}.</ref> [[Ptolemy II]] and [[Arsinoe II]], however [[N. G. L. Hammond]] posits that this is high unlikely.<ref name="Hammond260">{{harvnb|Hammond|260}}.</ref>

Initially, Pyrrhus had simply viewed his incursion into Macedon as an opportunity to plunder.<ref name="H263-N">{{harvnb|Hammond|1988|p=263}}; Plutarch, 26.</ref> However, the capture of numerous towns and the defection to his side of 2,000 Macedonian soldiers caused him to make his objective the seizure of the Macedonian throne. Antignous marched with his army to western Macedon and was confronted by Pyrrhus at the [[Battle of the Aous (274 BC)|Battle of the Aous]]. Pyrrhus began the engagements by slaughtering Antigonus' Gallic [[rearguard]] before securing the surrender of the Macedonian war elephants.<ref name="H263-N">{{harvnb|Hammond|1988|p=263}}; Plutarch, 26.</ref>  Demoralised by these sudden reverses, the Macedonian [[phalangites]] responded to Pyrrhus' appeals and defected to the Epiriote side.<ref name="H263-N">{{harvnb|Hammond|1988|p=263}}; Plutarch, 26.</ref> Abandoned by his army, Antigonus managed to escape to [[Thessaloniki]] with a small force of cavalry.<ref name="Green143">{{harvnb|Green|143}}.</ref> He was able to entrench himself there, protected by his strong [[navy]] which enabled him to maintain links with his possessions in southern Greece.<ref name="G143-P">{{harvnb|Green|1993|p=143}}; Hammond, p. 262.</ref>

Antigonus' flight left Pyrrhus in complete control of the Macedonian [[hinterland]] and [[Thessaly]] in [[Central Greece]].<ref name="G143-P">{{harvnb|Green|1993|p=143}}; Hammond, p. 262.</ref> However, not all of Macedon surrendered to the Epiriote King and he was compelled to send his [[general]], the [[Sparta]]n [[Prince]] [[Cleonymus of Sparta|Cleonymus]] to capture [[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]].<ref name="Hammond262">{{harvnb|Hammond|262}}.</ref> Despite initially being welcomed with enthusiasm by the Macedonians, he managed to alienate his new subjects when his Gallic troops ransacked the royal Macedonian [[tomb]]s at [[Vergina]].<ref name="G143-P">{{harvnb|Green|1993|p=143}}; Hammond, p. 263.</ref> By late 274 BC or early 273 BC, Pyrrhus secured the occupation of Macedonia and returned to Epirus, leaving his son [[Ptolemy (son of Pyrrhus)|Ptolemy]] to govern the region.<ref name="H263-N">{{harvnb|Hammond|1988|p=263}}; Green, p. 143.</ref>

==Advance into the Peloponnese==
[[File:Ancient peloponnese.svg|thumb|alt=Map depicting the Peloponnese, the southern region of Greece|A map depicting the Peloponnese. Pyrrhus advanced from Achaia in the north to Sparta before turning back north-est towards Argos.]]

Following his Macedonian triumph, Pyrrhus was approached by his officer Cleonymus. The Spartan convinced the Epiriote King to aid him in a scheme to seize control of his homeland.<ref name="H263-N">{{harvnb|Hammond|1988|p=263}}; Plutarch, 26.</ref> Cleonymus' reasons for seeking to attack Sparta were twofold. Firstly, he was angry that he had overlooked for the [[Kings of Sparta|Agiad]] kingship of Sparta in favour of his nephew, [[Areus II]]. [[Plutarch]] ascribes Cleonymus' failure to secure the throne to his arbitrariness and violent nature.<ref name="Plutarch26">{{harvnb|Plutarch|26}}.</ref> Furthermore, Cleonymus had become a target of ridicule in Lacedaimon by the fact that his new wife, [[Chilonis (daughter of Leotychidas)|Chilonis]], was engaging in an affair with [[Acrotatus II|Acrotatus]], the son of Areus.<ref name="P76-S">{{harvnb|Pomeroy|2002|p=76}}; Plutarch, 26.</ref>

Pyrrhus' motivation for agreeing to assist Cleonymus is more complex. By installing Cleonymus on the throne, the Epiriote would secure Sparta as an ally.<ref name="Wylie311">{{harvnb|Wylie|311}}.</ref> Additionally, by invading the [[Peloponnese]], Pyrrhus would be able to subdue any cities which had remained loyal to Antigonus. In doing so, he could prevent Antigonus using the [[peninsula]] as a base from which to launch a counter-attack on Macedon.<ref name="Hammond263">{{harvnb|Hammond|263}}.</ref> The size of the force assembled by Pyrrhus is indicative of his intention to extend his [[hegemony]] into the Peloponnese. The Epiriote King mustered an army consisting of 25,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry as well as 24 war elephants.<ref name="P26-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|26}}; Hammond, p. 264.</ref> In 272 BC, Pyrrhus marched his army through Central Greece to the city of [[Pleuron, Aetolia|Pleuron]] from where they were ferried across the [[Gulf of Corinth]] to the Peloponnese.<ref name="Hammond264">{{harvnb|Hammond|264}}.</ref> This suggests that the invasion was supported by the [[Aetolian League]], a powerful confederate in Central Greece which was allied with Pyrrhus and hostile to Antigonus.<ref name="Hammond260">{{harvnb|Hammond|260}}.</ref> Taking this route was highly advantageous to Pyrrhus as otherwise he would have had to cross the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] and Antigonus' stronghold [[Acrocorinth]]. {{citation needed}}

Antigonus attempted to exploit Pyrrhus' absence from Macedon by launching an invasion to reclaim his kingdom. However, his attack on Macedon was unsuccessful as he was defeated in battle by Pyrrhus' son, Ptolemy.<ref name="G144-P">{{harvnb|Green|1993|p=144}}; Plutarch, 26.</ref> Unperturbed by Antigonus' offensive, Pyrrhus advanced into the Peloponnese where he was welcomed in [[Achaia]].<ref name="Wylie311">{{harvnb|Wylie|311}}.</ref> The Epiriote army marched to [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]], a central Peloponnesian city which lay on the border with Sparta. Several of Sparta's neighbours, namely Megalopolis, [[Elis]] and many of the Achaians poleis, supported Pyrrhus invasion as they would profit from the reduction of Spartan influence in the region.<ref name="Cartledge and Spawforth33">{{harvnb|Cartledge and Spawforth|33}}.</ref> While his force was camped at Megalopolis, Pyrrhus received [[ambassador]]s from [[Messene]], [[Athens]], the [[Achaian League]] and Sparta.<ref name="P26-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|26}}; Cross, p. 85.; Hammond, p. 264.</ref> In response to the Spartans' inquires as to the reasons for his Peloponnesian incursion, Pyrrhus managed to dupe the envoys.<ref name="Cartledge and Spawforth33">{{harvnb|Cartledge and Spawforth|33}}.</ref> He told the Spartans that he had come to liberate any cities still held by Antigonus and that he hoped to sent his sons to Sparta to obtain a traditional education at the [[agoge]].<ref name="P26-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|26}}; Green, p. 144.</ref> However, when the emissaries return to Lacedaimon, Pyrrhus advanced into [[Laconia]]. He advanced south, following the course of the [[Eurotas River]] and ravaging the lands of the Spartan [[perioeci]].<ref name="Cartledge and Spawforth34">{{harvnb|Cartledge and Spawforth|34}}.</ref> It may have been at this time that Pyrrhus assigned Cleonymus a series of independent commands as he is recorded as subjugating the city of [[Alifeira]] in Elis as well as sacking Zarax in the [[Parnon]] region of Laconia.<ref name="C33-P">{{harvnb|Carledge and Spawforth|26}}; Hammond, p. 265.</ref> Pyrrhus' perfidy was met with anger in Sparta and ambassadors were immediately sent to Pyrrhus to rebuke him.<ref name="P26-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|26}}; Wylie, p. 311.</ref>

==Siege of Sparta==
{{Main|Siege of Sparta}}
[[File:Pyrrhus.JPG|left|thumb|alt=A bust of a man donned in a wreathed helmet.|A bust of Pyrrhus, King of Epirus, at the [[National Archaeological Museum of Naples]]. Pyrrhus' ambition and recklessness led to his untimely death at Argos.]]

The Spartans were caught unawares by Pyrrhus' invasion. Areus had taken the majority of the [[Spartan army]] with him to [[Crete]], where he was campaigning on behalf of [[Gortyn]] at the request of Ptolemaic Egypt.<ref name="P27-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|27}}; Hammond, p. 266.</ref> The result was that the settlement was lightly defended. Arriving at Lacedaimon as night fell, Cleonymus advised Pyrrhus to attack the city immediately. However, the Epiriote declined to as he was fearful of the damage that would be wrought by Gallic troops if they entered the city at night and moreover expected the sparsely defended city to surrender in the morning.<ref name="P27-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|27}}; Wylie, p. 312.</ref>

The Spartan [[gerousia]], council of Elders, suggested that the [[women in ancient Sparta|Spartan women]] be sent to Crete for their protection. They were dissuaded from doing so by [[Arachidamia]], the former [[queen consort|queen]] and grandmother of the [[List of kings of Sparta|Eurypontid King]] [[Eudamidas II]] who convinced them that the women could assist in the city's defence.<ref name="P16-S">{{harvnb|Pomeroy|2002|p=16}}; Plutarch, 28.</ref> In order to guarantee the fighting men some rest, the women and the elderly began bolstering defences. Aware that Pyrrhus had elephants with him, the defenders dug a large [[trench]] and sunk [[wagons]] into the ground at its flanks in order to hinder the Epiriote advance.<ref name="P16-S">{{harvnb|Pomeroy|2002|p=16}}; Plutarch, 28.</ref> Moreover, messengers were sent both to summon Areus back and to request aid from Antigonus, despite the fact the Sparta and Macedon had traditionally been hostile.<ref name="Wylie311">{{harvnb|Wylie|311}}.</ref> [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] claims that Sparta received some aid from Messene and the pro-Spartan faction at [[Argos]].<ref name="Pausanias1.13.6">{{harvnb|Pausanias|1.13.6}}.</ref>

The Epiriotes launched their first assault against the city at daybreak. However, they were unable to get a firm footing because of the trench and were repulsed by the defenders, who were encouraged by the women.<ref name="P76-S">{{harvnb|Pomeroy|2002|p=76}}; Plutarch, 28.</ref> In order to circumvent this obstacle. Pyrrhus ordered a 2,000 picked force of Gauls and [[Chaonians]] commanded by Ptolemy to attempt to go around the trench. Finding their path blocked by the wagons, they began to pulling them out of the ground.<ref name="Plutarch28">{{harvnb|Plutarch|28}}.</ref> Aware of the danger, Acrotatus used a series of depressions to attack this force from the rear and managed to the push the Epiriote flanking group into the trench after inflicting heavy casualties upon them.<ref name="Plutarch28">{{harvnb|Plutarch|28}}.</ref> Unable to make an impact on the defences, Pyrrhus ordered his troops to withdraw to their camp at nightfall.{{citation needed}}

[[File:Areus I King of Sparta.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A coin depicting the head of a man|A coin depicting King Areus of Sparta (309 BC-265 BC), whose arrival with reinforcements saved Sparta from Pyrrhus.]]
After receiving a favourable [[omen]] during the night Pyrrhus renewed his assault.<ref name="Plutarch29">{{harvnb|Plutarch|29}}.</ref> An effect of the shortage of warriors was that the Spartan women were active in providing the defenders with [[projectile|missiles]] and refreshments as well as taking away the wounded.<ref name="P29-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|29}}; Wylie, p. 312.</ref> In an attempt to nullify the Spartans' advantage, the Epiriotes tried to fill up with trench with debris and bodies but were prevented from doing so by the Lacedaimonians. Responding to this Spartan counter-attack, Pyrrhus personally led a charge against the Spartan lines and succeeded in entering the city, spreading panic amongst the defenders.<ref name="Plutarch29">{{harvnb|Plutarch|29}}.</ref> However, at this point his horse threw him after it was wounded by a [[javelin]] in the belly.<ref name="P29-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|29}}; Wylie, p. 312.</ref> Pyrrhus' fall threw his companion into a state of dismay, permitting the Spartans to rally and they managed to slay many of Pyrrhus' companions in a barrage of missiles. Despite this, the Epiriote King was taken safely back to tis camp.<ref name="P29-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|29}}; Wylie, p. 312.</ref>

Prompted by this unsuccessful foray, Pyrrhus order his army to return to its camp. He now expected the Spartans seek terms as the severity of their casualties would make the defence unsustainable.<ref name="Plutarch29">{{harvnb|Plutarch|29}}.</ref> However, Sparta was saved by the arrival of unexpected reinforcements. In the interim, Antigonus had launched another offensive in northern Greece and succeeded in evicting Pyrrhus' garrisons from Macedon (this possibly accounts for the presence of Ptomlemy in Pyrrhus' army).<ref name="H265-N">{{harvnb|Hammond|1988|p=265}}; Green, 144.</ref> Having reclaimed his kingdom, Antigonus moved south into the Peloponnese, probably using the sea route to avoid a confrontation with the Aetolian League.<ref name="Hammond266">{{harvnb|Hammond|266}}.</ref> Upon his arrival in [[Corinth]], he sent his general [[Ameinias the Phocian]] with a group of mercenaries to assist the Spartans.<ref name="P29-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|29}}; Hammond, p. 266.</ref> The arrival of the Macedonia mercenaries was closely followed by Areus' return from Crete with 2,000 men.  Enheartened by the arrival of these reinforcements, the defenders prepared to face Pyrrhus' next assault. The Epiriotes launched an attack in the morning but after this was repelled Pyrrhus became convinced of the futility of the situation and ordered his men to lift the [[siege]].<ref name="P30-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|30}}; Hammond, p. 266.</ref>

==March to Argos==
[[Image:SouthernPeloponessus.gif|right|thumb|alt=A map of the southern and central Peloponnese, the southernmost area of Greece. Most of the cities mentioned in the article text are shown.|A map of the southern and central Peloponnese (the southernmost area of Greece) showing important cities of the region.]]
Pyrrhus retreated with his army into the Laconian hinterland with the purpose of wintering there before making another attempt against Sparta.<ref name="Plutarch30">{{harvnb|Plutarch|30}}.</ref> However, as his troops were ravaging the surrounding countryside, he received news that Antigonus was marching on Argos from Corinth on his way to trap Pyrrhus in Laconia.<ref name="G144-G">Green. 144; {{harvnb|Hammond|1988|p=266}}.</ref> Pyrrhus was approached by Aristeas, the leader of the democratic faction in Argos, who sought Epiriote support to counter the pro-Macedonian aristocratic party of Argos led by Aristippos.<ref name="G144-G">Green. 144; {{harvnb|Hammond|1988|p=266}}</ref> Accepting Aristeas' proposal, Pyrrhus began his march north to the [[Argolis]].{{citation needed}}

Pyrrhus' advance on Argos did not go smoothly as his army was constantly harassed by vengeful Spartan troops led by Areus. By setting up ambushes and occupying strategic positions along the Epiriote line of retreat, the Lacedaimonians were able to inflict heavy casualties on Pyrrhus' rearguard of Gauls and [[Molossians]].<ref name="P30-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|30}}; Wylie, p. 312; Hammond, p. 266.</ref> In an attempt to restore the wavering morale of his rear, Pyrrhus sent Ptolemy to assume its command. Pyrrhus hoped that the presence this son amongst the troops would stiffen their resolve and enable to him to extricate the remainder of his troops from the narrow pass through which they were passing.<ref name="Plutarch30">{{harvnb|Plutarch|30}}.</ref> Ptolemy's position was attacked by a picked Spartan war band under the command of Evaclus. In the ensuing struggle, Ptolemy was slain by the Spartans causing his remaining troops to rout. The victorious Spartans pursued the fleeing Epiriote rearguard until they were checked by some Epiriote infantry.<ref name="P30-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|30}}; Wylie, p. 312; Hammond, p. 266.</ref>

Upon hearing of his son's death and the collapse of his rearguard, Pyrrhus summoned his Molossian cavalry and charged the Spartans. In the battle that followed, Pyrrhus killed the Spartan leader Evaclus with his own hand and succeeded in annihilating the pursuing Spartan troops.<ref name="P30-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|30}}; Wylie, p. 312.</ref> After this skirmish, the Epiriotes continued their march to Argos. However, upon reaching his destination, he found that Antigonus had arrived at Argos first and camped to the city's north.<ref name="Hammond266">{{harvnb|Hammond|266}}.</ref> The Macedonian presence compelled Pyrrhus to pitch camp at [[Nauplion]] to the south of Argos.<ref name="P31-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|31}}; Hammond, p. 266.</ref>

Pyrrhus attempted to goad Antigonus into fighting a pitched battle on the plain in front of Argos but the Macedonian King was unmoved.<ref name="P31-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|31}}; Wylie, p. 312</ref> The Argives sent ambassadors to both Kings, beseeching them to respect the city's neutrality. Antigonus agreed to the Argives' terms and gave his son as a hostage in order to demonstrate his sincerity. While Pyrrhus agreed to retreat from Argos, he failed to give a pledge and as a result was regarded with suspicion.<ref name="P31-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|31}}; Wylie, p. 312</ref>

==Battle of Argos==
[[File:Pyrrhus and his Elephants.gif|right|thumb|Depiction of war elephants in the midst of battle|A depiction of Pyrrhus and his war elephants. He brought 24 elephants with him to invade the Peloponnese. Pyrrhus' use of elephants in the Battle of Argos led to his demise.]]
During the night, Pyrrhus was able to enter Argos. While Pausanias recounts that he did so by force,<ref name="Pausanias1.13.7">{{harvnb|Pausanias|1.13.7}}.</ref> Plutarch asserts that Diamperes Gate had been left open for the Epiriotes by Aristeas.<ref name="Plutarch32">{{harvnb|Plutarch|32}}.</ref> Hammond opines that it is more likely that Aristeas admitted Pyrrhus into the city.<ref name="Hammond266">{{harvnb|Hammond|266}}</ref> Although Pyrrhus' Gauls were able to occupy the Argive [[agora]], the rest of the army was delayed due to the war elephants being too large to pass through the gate. In order for them to enter, the towers need to be taken off their backs and reattached once they were inside the city.<ref name="P32-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|32}}; Hammond, p. 266.</ref> Furthermore, Pyrrhus left the majority of his army outside the city walls under the command of his son Helenus.<ref name="Plutarch33">{{harvnb|Plutarch|33}}.</ref> This delay gave the Argives enough to reach their citadel, the Aspis, and seek aid from Antigonus. The Macedonian King responded immediately, advancing towards the city walls and sent a relief force inside under the command of his son Halcyoneus.<ref name="P32-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|32}}; Hammond, p. 267.</ref>

The situation further deteriorated for Pyrrhus when Areus entered Argos with a force of 1,000 lightly armed Cretans and Spartans.<ref name="P33-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|33}}; Hammond, p. 267.</ref> The Argives, assisted by their Spartan and Macedonian allies, launched a counter-attack on Pyrrhus' Gallic troops in the agora and threw them into a state of panic. Due to the labyrinthine layout of the city and the darkness, both Pyrrhus' advancing troops and those of his opponents become scattered throughout Argos. The result was that Pyrrhus, entering the city at the head of his cavalry to assist the Gauls, was unable to effectively communicate his commands to his soldiers.<ref name="P32-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|32}}; Wylie, p. 312.</ref> Realising the difficulty of his situation, Pyrrhus ordered his army to retreat from Argos as day broke.<ref name="P33-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|33}}; Hammond, p. 267.</ref>

Understanding that the gates were too narrow for his army to exit in an orderly fashion, Pyrrhus ordered Helenus to tear down part of the wall and to be prepared to fend off any enemy counter-attacks against the retreating troops.<ref name="P33-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|33}}; Wylie, p. 312.</ref> However, the instructions brought by the messenger were unclear and instead of organising the retreat, Helenus advanced with the rest of the army into Argos. With the majority of his troops streaming in through the gates, Pyrrhus' line of retreat was blocked off.<ref name="P33-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|33}}; Wylie, p. 312.</ref> The disorder was exacerbated when Pyrrhus' largest elephant fell and blocked the gateway and another elephant started running amok after his [[mahout]] was felled.<ref name="P33-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|33}}; Hammond, p. 267.</ref>  The weight of the enemy's assault pushed Pyrrhus and his troops from the agora and compelled them to fight in the narrow street leading to the Diamperes Gate. In the fighting which ensued, Pyrrhus was wounded by a spear wielded by an Argive. As Pyrrhus turned to strike down his assailant, he was hit on the head by a [[tile|roof tile]] thrown by his attacker's mother.<ref name="Plutarch33">{{harvnb|Plutarch|33}}.</ref> Pyrrhus was either killed by the force of the tile's impact<ref name="Hammond266">{{harvnb|Hammond|266}}.</ref> or, alternately, having fallen dazed from his horse he was [[decapitated]] by one of Antigonus' Macedonian soldiers, Zopyrus.<ref name="P34-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|34}}; Wylie, p. 313.</ref> Pyrrhus' head was brought by Halcyoneus to Antigonus, who expressed dismay when he saw it and upbraided his son for acting in such a barbarous manner.<ref name="P34-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|34}}; Green, p. 144.; Hammond, p. 267.</ref> Upon Pyrrhus' death, Epiriote resistance crumbled and Antigonus accepted the surrender of Helenus, giving him Pyrrhus' body for burial.<ref name="P34-P">{{harvnb|Plutarch|34}}; Hammond, p. 267.</ref>

==Aftermath==
The expedition into the Peloponnese was a disaster for Epiriote ambitions. Although Helenus was permitted by Antigonus to return to his homeland with the remainder of his army, Epirus ceased to be a regional power.<ref name="Plutarch34">{{harvnb|Plutarch|34}}.</ref> Pyrrhus' son and successor, [[Alexander II of Epirus]] was granted generous terms by the Macedonian King. Epirus was able to keep Pyrrhus' conquests of [[Tymphaea]], [[Parauaea]] and [[Atintanians|Atintania]] in western Macedon. Antigonus realised that an independent Epirus was essential in order to act as a buffer against the [[Illyrians]] to the north.<ref name="Hammond267">{{harvnb|Hammond|267}}</ref>

Antignous emerged from the conflict as the unchallenged ruler of Macedon and the leading power in Greece.<ref name="Hammond267">{{harvnb|Hammond|267}}</ref> After his victory in Argos, Antigonus was able to install his supporter Aristippos as [[tyrant]] of the city and appointed various pro-Macedonian leaders as tyrants in other Greek cities.<ref name="Green144">{{harvnb|Hammond|273}}</ref> His support for tyrants over democratic rulers would lead to growing resentment amongst the Greek cities against Macedon.<ref name="Green144">{{harvnb|Green|144}}</ref> On his journey north to Macedon, Pyrrhus succeeded in placing garrisons in the cities of [[Chalcis]] and [[Eretria]] on the important island of [[Euboia]] with the outcome being that he further consolidated his power in Greece.<ref name="Green144">{{harvnb|Green|144}}</ref> The Spartan-Macedon alliance proved to be transient. Angered by Macedon's supremacy and full of ambition, Areus formed a coalition with several Greek poleis, most notably Athens. In the resulting [[Chremonidean War]], Areus was slain by his former ally Antigonus in a battle on the Isthmus of Corinth in 265 BC.<ref name="Green147">{{harvnb|Green|147}}</ref> The war ended in a defeat that was so crushing for Sparta that it would not rise as a [[regional power]] again until the reign of [[Cleomenes III]] thirty years later.{{citation needed}}
