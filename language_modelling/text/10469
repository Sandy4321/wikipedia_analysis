'''Robert Augustus Toombs''' ([[July 2]], [[1810]] &ndash; [[December 15]], [[1885]]) was an [[United States|American]] political leader, Secretary of State of the Confederacy, and a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[general]] in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

== Early life ==
Born near [[Washington, Georgia|Washington]], [[Wilkes County, Georgia]], Robert Augustus Toombs was the fifth child of Catherine Huling and Robert Toombs. His father died when he was five, and he entered [[Franklin College of Arts and Sciences|Franklin College]] at the [[University of Georgia]] in [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]] when he was just fourteen. During his time at Franklin College he was a member of the [[Demosthenian Literary Society]], which reveres him as its most accomplished and legendary alumnus to this day.  After the university chastised him for unbecoming conduct in a card-playing incident, Toombs continued his education at [[Union College]], in [[Schenectady, New York]], from which he graduated in [[1828]]. Toombs went on to study law at the [[University of Virginia]] [[University of Virginia Law School|Law School]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]]. Shortly after his admission to the Georgia [[bar (law)|bar]], he married his childhood sweetheart, Julia A. Dubose, with whom he had three children.

== Public service ==
Toombs was admitted to the bar in [[1830]], and served in the [[Georgia House of Representatives]] ([[1838]], [[1840]]&ndash;[[1841]], and [[1843]]&ndash;[[1844]]). His genial character, proclivity for entertainment, and unqualified success on the legal circuit earned Toombs the growing attention and admiration of his fellow Georgians. On the wave of his growing popularity, Toombs won a seat to the [[United States House of Representatives]] ([[1844]]&ndash;[[1853]]), and joined his close friend and fellow representative [[Alexander H. Stephens]] from [[Crawfordville, Georgia]]. Their friendship forged a powerful personal and political bond that effectively defined and articulated Georgia's position on national issues in the middle decades of the [[nineteenth century]]. Toombs, like Stephens, emerged as a states' rights partisan, became a national Whig, and once the [[United States Whig Party|Whig Party]] dissolved, aided in the creation of the short-lived Constitutional Union Party in the early [[1850s]]. From [[1853]] to [[1861]] Toombs served in the [[United States Senate]], only reluctantly joining the Democratic Party when lack of interest among other states doomed the Constitutional Union Party. 

== From Unionist to Confederate ==

Throughout the [[1840s]] and [[1850s]], Toombs fought to reconcile national policies with sectional interests. His support for the Georgia Platform in [[1850]] demonstrated his commitment to preserving the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. He opposed the [[Annexation of Texas]], the [[Mexican-American War]], [[James K. Polk|President Polk]]'s [[Oregon]] policy, and the [[Walker Tariff]] of [[1846]]. In common with [[Alexander H. Stephens]] and [[Howell Cobb]], he defended [[Henry Clay]]'s [[Compromise of 1850]] against southerners who advocated [[secession]] from the Union as the only solution to sectional tensions over slavery. He denounced the [[Nashville Convention]], opposed the secessionists in Georgia, and helped to frame the famous [[Georgia platform]] (1850). His position and that of Southern Unionists during the decade [[1850]]&ndash;[[1860]] has often been misunderstood. They disapproved of secession, not because they considered it wrong in principle, but because they considered it inexpedient. He favored the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]], the admission of [[Kansas]] under the [[Lecompton Constitution]], and the [[English Bill]] ([[1858]]). However, his faith in the resiliency and effectiveness of the national government to resolve sectional conflicts waned as the 1850s drew to a close.

On [[June 24]], [[1856]], Toombs introduced in the Senate the [[Toombs Bill]], which proposed a constitutional convention in Kansas under conditions which were acknowledged by various anti-slavery leaders as fair, and which mark the greatest concessions made by the pro-slavery senators during the Kansas struggle. The bill did not provide for the submission of the constitution to popular vote, and the silence on this point of the territorial law under which the Lecompton Constitution of Kansas was framed in [[1857]] was the crux of the Lecompton struggle.

== Secession and Civil War ==
By [[1860]] Toombs had drifted into the [[States' Rights]] camp in opposition to northern abolitionists. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1860|presidential campaign of 1860]] he supported [[John C. Breckinridge]], and on [[December 22]], soon after the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]], sent a telegram to Georgia that asserted that "secession by the 4th of March next should be thundered forth from the ballot-box by the united voice of Georgia." He delivered a farewell address in the Senate ([[January 7]] [[1861]]), returned to Georgia, and with Governor [[Joseph E. Brown]] led the fight for secession against Stephens and [[Herschel V. Johnson]] ([[1812]]&ndash;[[1880]]). His influence was a most powerful factor in inducing the "old-line Whigs" to support immediate secession.

Benjamin]], [[Stephen Mallory]], [[Christopher Memminger]], [[Alexander Stephens]], [[LeRoy Pope Walker]], [[Jefferson Davis]], [[John Henninger Reagan|John H. Reagan]] and [[Robert Toombs]].]]
Unlike the crises of 1850, these events galvanized Toombs and energized ambitions for becoming the president of the new [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] nation. The selection of [[Jefferson Davis]] as the new nation's chief executive not only dashed Toombs's highest hopes but also turned him into one of the most outspoken critics of the Confederate government and its policies. Nevertheless, Davis chose Toombs as his first [[Confederate States Secretary of State]]. Within months of his appointment, a frustrated Toombs stepped down to join the [[Confederate States Army]]. He received a commission as a [[brigadier general]] on [[July 19]] [[1861]], and served first as a brigade commander in the (Confederate) [[Army of the Potomac (Confederate)|Army of the Potomac]], and then in [[David R. Jones]]'s [[division (military)|division]] of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] through the [[Peninsula Campaign]], [[Seven Days Battles]], [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], and [[Maryland Campaign]]. He was wounded in the hand at the [[Battle of Antietam]]. He resigned his CSA commission on [[March 3]] [[1863]], to become [[Colonel]] of the 3rd Cavalry of the Georgia [[Militia]], and subsequently served as a brigadier general and adjutant and inspector-general of General [[Gustavus Woodson Smith|Gustavus W. Smith]]'s division of Georgia militia. Denied a military promotion, he resigned his commission and returned home to [[Washington, Georgia]].

== Final years ==
When the Confederacy finally collapsed in [[1865]], Toombs barely escaped arrest by Union troops and went into hiding until he fled to [[Cuba]] on [[November 4]], and then to [[London]] and [[Paris]]. He returned to the United States via [[Canada]] in [[1867]]. Because he refused to request a pardon from Congress, he never regained his American citizenship. He did restore his lucrative law practice as an "unreconstructed" southerner. In addition, he dominated the Georgia constitutional convention of [[1877]], where once again he demonstrated the political skill and temperament that earlier had earned him a reputation as one of Georgia's most effective leaders.
