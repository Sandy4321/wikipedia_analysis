==History==

The church was founded around the end of the 11th century, probably by Hugh de Mara, Lord of Lawton.<ref name="richards"/>  There is a tradition that in the 8th century the body of [[Werburgh|St Werburgh]] rested overnight on the site of the church while it was being carried from [[Lincolnshire]] to [[Chester]].<ref name="hist"/>  In 1652 the church was struck by lightning and 11 people in the church were killed.  The body of the church was destroyed by fire in 1798 and rebuilt by 1803.<ref name="richards">{{citation | last =Richards | first =Raymond | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Old Cheshire Churches | publisher =B.
