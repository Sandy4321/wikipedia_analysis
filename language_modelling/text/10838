{{nihongo|'''''Aki'''''|<U+5B89><U+82B8> (<U+6226><U+8266>)|Aki (senkan}} was a [[semi-dreadnought]] [[battleship]] built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during the first decade of the 20th century. She was the second battleship built in Japan and the first to use [[steam turbine]]s. The ship was named for [[Aki Province]], now a part of [[Hiroshima Prefecture]]. The ship saw no combat during [[World War I]]. ''Aki'' was disarmed and sunk as a target in 1922<U+2013>24 in accordance with the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922.

==Background==
The ''Satsuma'' class was ordered in late 1904 under the 1904 War Naval Supplementary Program during the [[Russo-Japanese War]].<ref>Itani, Lengerer & Rehm-Takahara, p. 53</ref> Unlike the previous {{sclass-|Katori|battleship|0}} [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s, they were the first battleships ordered from Japanese shipyards.<ref name=e9>Evans & Peattie, p. 159</ref> They were originally designed with a dozen {{convert|12|in|adj=on|0}} guns, but had to be redesigned because of a shortage of guns in Japan<ref name=g8/> and to reduce costs.<ref name=e9/>

==Design and description==
The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|492|ft|m|1}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|83|ft|7|in|m|1}}, and a normal [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|27|ft|6|in|m|1}}. She displaced {{convert|20100|LT|t|lk=in}} at normal load. The crew consisted of 931 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=j7>Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 23</ref>

''Aki'' was fitted with a pair of Curtiss steam turbine sets using steam from 15 Miyabara [[water-tube boiler]]s. The turbines were rated at a total of {{convert|24000|shp|lk=in}} for a design speed of {{convert|20|kn}}. The ship reached a top speed of {{convert|20.25|kn}} during her sea trials from {{convert|27740|shp|abbr=on}}.<ref name=j4>Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, pp. 23<U+2013>24</ref> She carried enough coal and oil to give her a range of {{convert|9100|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. Unlike her [[sister ship|half-sister]], she had three [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s.<ref name=p5>Preston, p. 195</ref>

The ship was completed with four 45-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[EOC 12 inch/45 naval gun|12-inch 41st Year Type guns]] in two gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the [[superstructure]].<ref name=j7/> They fired {{convert|850|lb|kg|adj=on|0}}<ref>Friedman, p. 272</ref> [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] (AP) shells to a maximum range of {{convert|22000|m|yd|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.<ref>Itani, Lengerer & Rehm-Takahara, p. 67</ref> The [[Battleship secondary armament|intermediate armament]] consisted of six twin-gun turrets equipped with 45-caliber [[Vickers 10 inch /45 naval gun|Type 41 10-inch guns]], three turrets on each side of the superstructure.<ref name=p5/> Her heavy intermediate armament of guns larger than {{convert|9|in|0}} is why the ship is considered to be a semi-dreadnought.<ref name=j7/>

''Aki''{{'}}s secondary armament consisted of eight 45-caliber [[6-inch/45 41st Year Type naval gun|6-inch 41st Year Type guns]], mounted in [[casemate]]s in the sides of the hull.<ref name=g8/> The ship was also equipped with eight [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]] 40-caliber [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder 12-cwt guns]]<ref group=Note>"Cwt" is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.</ref> and four 28-caliber [[8-centimeter/40 41st Year Type naval gun|12-pounder QF guns]].<ref name=j7/> In addition, the battleship was fitted with five submerged {{convert|18|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s, two on each [[broadside]] and one in the stern.<ref name=p5/>

The [[waterline]] [[armor belt|main belt]] of the ''Satsuma''-class vessels consisted of [[Krupp cemented armor]] that had a maximum thickness of {{convert|9|in|mm|0}} [[amidships]]. It tapered to a thickness of {{convert|4|in|mm|0}} inches at the ends of the ship.<ref name=g8/> A {{convert|6|in|0|adj=on}} [[strake]] of armor protected the casemates.<ref name=j7/> The barbettes for the main guns were {{convert|7|-|9.5|in}} thick. The armor of ''Aki''{{'}}s main gun turrets had a maximum thickness of {{convert|8|in|0}} inches. The [[Deck (ship)|deck]] armor was {{convert|2|-|3|in|mm|0}} thick and the [[conning tower]] was protected by six inches of armor.<ref name=g8>Gardiner & Gray, p. 238</ref>

==Construction and career==
''Aki'', named for [[Aki Province]],<ref>Silverstone, p. 325</ref> was [[Keel|laid down]] at [[Kure Naval Arsenal]] on 15 March 1906. She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 15 April 1907,<ref name=g8/> but construction was suspended for about five months after the decision was made on 26 November to install steam turbines on ''Aki'' and the [[armored cruiser]] {{ship|Japanese armored cruiser|Ibuki||2}}. ''Aki''{{'}}s turbines were already behind schedule and the suspension allowed the less valuable ship to be completed first, and changes made to its turbines after testing were also incorporated into ''Aki''{{'}}s turbines.<ref>Itani, Lengerer & Rehm-Takahara, pp. 60 and footnote 19, p. 79</ref> ''Aki'' was finally completed on 11 March 1911<ref name=g8/> and her first [[captain (nautical)|captain]] was [[Tatsuo Matsumura]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/2096099?searchTerm=battleship%20aki&searchLimits=l-decade=191|title=Japanese Squadron Visiting Training Ships|date=14 June 1916|work=The Argus (Melbourne, Victoria)|page=9|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref>

When World War I began in August 1914, ''Aki'' was refitting at Kure Naval Arsenal. She was assigned to the 1st Battleship Squadron upon the completion of her refit and remained with it until she was transferred to the 2nd Battleship Squadron in 1918.<ref name=p5/> The ship was disarmed at Yokosuka in 1922 to comply with the provisions of the Washington Naval Treaty, stricken from the [[Navy List]] during 1923 and converted into a target ship. ''Aki'' was sunk by the battlecruiser {{ship|Japanese battleship|Kong<U+014D>||2}} and the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hy<U+016B>ga||2}} on 2 September 1924 in [[Tokyo Bay]].<ref>Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 24</ref> Two of her 10-inch gun turrets were installed as [[coastal artillery]] batteries on [[J<U+014D>gashima]] island to protect Tokyo Bay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www006.upp.so-net.ne.jp/fortress/tsugaru/ilien.htm|title=Coastal Fortresses|language=Japanese|accessdate=25 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/13811272/Survey-of-Japanese-Seacoast-Artillery-1946|title=Survey of Japanese Seacoast Artillery|date=1 February 1946|publisher=General Headquarters, United States Army Forces, Pacific|page=92|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref>
