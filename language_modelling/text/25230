==Discovery==
[[File:Turist den-peschera.jpg|thumb |right |250 px |Tourists in front of the Denisova Cave, where "X woman" was found]]
In 2008, Russian [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] from the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology of [[Novosibirsk]], working at the site of [[Denisova Cave]] in the [[Altai Mountains]] of [[Siberia]], uncovered a small bone fragment from the fifth finger of a juvenile [[hominin]], dubbed the "X woman" (referring to the maternal descent of mitochondrial DNA,<ref name="The Guardian"/>) or the Denisova hominin. Artifacts, including a bracelet, excavated in the cave at the same level were [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dated]] to around 40,000 [[Before Present|BP]].

A team of scientists led by Johannes Krause and Swedish biologist [[Svante P<U+00E4><U+00E4>bo]] from the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany, [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] mtDNA extracted from the fragment. Because of the cool climate in the location of the Denisova Cave, the discovery benefited from DNA's ability to survive for longer periods at lower temperatures.<ref name="P<U+00E4><U+00E4>bo et al." /> The average annual temperature of the cave remains at 0<U+00B0>C, which has contributed to the preservation of archaic DNA among the remains discovered.<ref name="NYT-01302012">{{cite news |last=Mitchell |first=Alanna|title=DNA Turning Human Story Into a Tell-All|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/31/science/gains-in-dna-are-speeding-research-into-human-origins.html|date=30 January 2012 |publisher=[[NYTimes]] |accessdate=31 January 2012 }}</ref> The analysis indicated that modern humans, [[Neanderthals]], and the Denisova hominin last shared a common ancestor around {{Nowrap|1 million}} years ago.<ref name="The Scientist">{{Citation |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/57254/#ixzz0j820ioz1 |title=New hominin found via mtDNA |work=The Scientist |date=24 March 2010 |first=Alla |last=Katsnelson }}</ref>

The mtDNA analysis further suggested this new hominin species was the result of an early migration [[Recent African origin of modern humans|out of Africa]], distinct from the later out-of-Africa migrations associated with Neanderthals and modern humans, but also distinct from the earlier African exodus of ''[[Homo erectus]]''.<ref name="The Scientist"/> P<U+00E4><U+00E4>bo noted the existence of this distant branch creates a much more complex picture of humankind during the [[Late Pleistocene]].<ref name="The Guardian">{{Citation |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/mar/24/new-human-species-siberia |title=New species of human ancestor found in Siberia |work=The Guardian |date=24 March 2010 |first=Ian |last=Sample }}</ref>

Later in 2010, a second paper from the Svante P<U+00E4><U+00E4>bo group reported the prior discovery, in 2000, of a third upper molar from a young adult, dating from about the same time (the finger was from level 11 in the cave sequence, the tooth from level 11.1). The tooth differed in several aspects from those of Neanderthals, while having archaic characteristics similar to the teeth of ''Homo erectus''.  They again performed mitochondrial DNA analysis on the tooth and found it to have a different but similar sequence to that of the finger bone, indicating a divergence time about 7,500 years before, and suggesting it belonged to a different individual from the same population.<ref name="Reich et al.">{{Citation |first1=David |last1=Reich

In 2011, a toe bone was discovered in layer 11 of the cave, and hence was contemporary with the finger bone.  Preliminary characterization of the bone's mitochondrial DNA suggests it belonged to a Neanderthal, not a Denisovan.<ref name="AAAS-Gibbons">{{Cite journal

==Anatomy==
Little is known of the precise anatomical features of the Denisovans since the only physical remains discovered thus far are the [[Phalanges of the hand|finger bone]] and two teeth from which genetic material has been gathered, and a [[Phalanges of the foot|toe bone]]. The single finger bone is unusually broad and robust, well outside the variation seen in modern people. Surprisingly, it belonged to a female, indicating the Denisovans were extremely robust, perhaps similar in build to the Neanderthals. The tooth that has been characterized shares no derived morphological features with Neanderthal or modern humans.<ref name="Reich et al."/> An initial morphological characterization of the toe bone led to the suggestion that it may have belonged to a Neanderthal-Denisovan hybrid individual, although a critic suggested the morphology was inconclusive. This toe bone is currently undergoing DNA analysis by P<U+00E4><U+00E4>bo.<ref name="newscientist"/>

Some older finds may or may not belong to the Denisovan line. These includes the skulls from [[Dali (fossil)|Dali]] and [[Maba Man|Maba]], and a number of more fragmentary remains from Asia. Asia is not well mapped with regard to human evolution, and the above finds may represent a group of "Asian Neanderthals".

==Mitochondrial DNA analysis==
The mtDNA from the finger bone differs from that of modern humans by 385 bases ([[nucleotide]]s) in the mtDNA strand out of approximately 16,500, whereas the difference between modern humans and [[Neanderthal genome|Neanderthals]] is around 202 bases. In contrast, the difference between [[chimpanzee]]s and modern humans is approximately 1,462 mtDNA base pairs.<ref name="P<U+00E4><U+00E4>bo et al." /> This suggested a divergence time around one million years ago. The mtDNA from a tooth bore a high similarity to that of the finger bone, indicating they belonged to the same population.<ref name="Reich et al."/>  From a second tooth, an mtDNA sequence was recovered that showed an unexpectedly large number of genetic differences compared to that found in the other tooth and the finger, suggesting a high degree of mtDNA diversity. These two individuals from the same cave showed more diversity than seen among sampled Neanderthals from all of Eurasia, and were as different as modern-day humans from different continents.<ref name=Pennisi />

==Nuclear genome analysis==
In the same second 2010 paper, the authors reported the isolation and sequencing of nuclear DNA from the Denisova finger bone. This specimen showed an unusual degree of DNA preservation and low level of contamination. They were able to achieve near-complete genomic sequencing, allowing a detailed comparison with Neanderthal and modern humans.  From this analysis, they concluded, in spite of the apparent divergence of their mitochondrial sequence, the Denisova population along with Neanderthal shared a common branch from the lineage leading to modern African humans. The estimated average time of divergence between Denisovan and Neanderthal sequences is 640,000 years ago, and the time between both of these and the sequences of modern Africans is 804,000 years ago. They suggest the divergence of the Denisova mtDNA results either from the persistence of a lineage purged from the other branches of humanity through [[genetic drift]] or else an [[introgression]] from an older hominin lineage.<ref name="Reich et al."/> In 2013, the mtDNA sequence from the femur of a 400,000 year old ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' from the [[Atapuerca Mountains#Sima de los Huesos .281983-.29|Sima de los Huesos Cave]] in Spain was found to be most similar to that of Denisova.<ref name="NAT-20131204" />

==Interbreeding==
{{see also|Archaic human admixture with modern humans}}
A detailed comparison of the Denisovan, Neanderthal, and human genomes has revealed evidence for a complex web of interbreeding among the lineages.  Through such interbreeding, 17% of the Denisova genome represents DNA from the local Neanderthal population, while evidence was also found of a contribution to the nuclear genome from an ancient hominin lineage yet to be identified,<ref name=Pennisi /> perhaps the source of the anomalously ancient mtDNA.

Analysis of genomes of [[modern humans]] show that they mated with at least two groups of [[ancient humans]]: [[Neanderthals]] (more similar to those found in the Caucasus than those from the Altai region)<ref name=Pennisi /> and Denisovans.<ref name="NYT-01302012" /><ref name="Reich et al."/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Green RE, Krause J, Briggs AW, ''et al.'' |title=A draft sequence of the Neandertal genome |journal=Science |volume=328 |issue=5979 |pages=710<U+2013>22 |date=May 2010 |pmid=20448178 |doi=10.1126/science.1188021 |url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/press/presskit-neandertal/pdf/Science_Green.pdf}}</ref> Approximately 4% of the [[DNA]] of non-African [[modern human]]s is shared with Neanderthals, suggesting interbreeding.<ref name="Reich et al."/> Tests comparing the Denisova hominin genome with those of six modern humans <U+2013> a [[<U+01C3>Kung people|<U+01C3>Kung]] from South Africa, a [[Nigerian]], a [[French people|Frenchman]], a [[Papua New Guinea]]n, a [[Bougainville Island]]er and a [[Han Chinese]] <U+2013> showed that between 4% and 6% of the [[genome]] of [[Melanesians]] (represented by the Papua New Guinean and Bougainville Islander) derives from a Denisovan population. This DNA was possibly introduced during the early [[human migration|migration]] to Melanesia. These findings are in concordance with the results of other comparison tests which show a relative increase in allele sharing between the Denisovan and the Aboriginal Australian genome, compared to other Eurasians and African populations, however it has been observed that Papuans, the population of Papua New Guinea, have more allele sharing than Aboriginal Australians.<ref>Rasmussen et al 2011  An Aboriginal Australian genome reveals separate human dispersals into Asia. Science. 2011 Oct 7;334(6052):94-8. {{DOI|10.1126/science.1211177}}</ref>

Melanesians may not be the only modern-day descendants of Denisovans. David Reich of [[Harvard University]], in collaboration with Mark Stoneking of the Planck Institute team, found genetic evidence that Denisovan ancestry is shared by Melanesians, [[Australian Aborigines]], and smaller scattered groups of people in Southeast Asia, such as the [[Mamanwa]], a [[Negrito]] people in the [[Philippines]]. However, not all [[Negritos]] were found to possess Denisovan genes; [[Onge people|Onge]] [[Andamanese people|Andaman Islanders]] and Malaysian [[Jehai language|Jehai]], for example, were found to have no significant Denisovan inheritance. These data place the interbreeding event in mainland Southeast Asia, and suggest that Denisovans once ranged widely over eastern Asia.<ref name="Callaway."/><ref name="Reich">{{Citation|author=Reich ''et al.''|journal=

The immune system's [[HLA type|HLA]] alleles have drawn particular attention in the attempt to identify genes that may derive from archaic human populations.  Although not present in the sequenced Denisova genome, the distribution pattern and divergence of HLA-B*73 from other HLA alleles has led to the suggestion that it [[introgression|introgressed]] from Denisovans into humans in west Asia. Indeed, half of the HLA alleles of modern Eurasians represent archaic HLA haplotypes, and have been inferred to be of Denisovan or Neanderthal origin.<ref name="10.1126/science.1209202">{{cite journal | author=Laurent Abi-Rached, ''et al.'' | title= The Shaping of Modern Human Immune Systems by Multiregional Admixture with Archaic Humans | journal=Science | volume=334 | issue=6052 | pages= | date=25 August 2011 |doi=10.1126/science.1209202 |archiveurl=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1122&context=publichealthresources|archivedate=Aug 2011|pmc=3677943| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2011/08/19/science.1209202 | pmid=21868630

There is evidence of a minimum 0.5% Neanderthal gene flow into the Denisovans.<ref name=prualtai>{{cite journal| last=Pr<U+00FC>fer|first=K.| coauthors=Racimo, Fe.; Patterson, N.; Jay, F.; Sankararaman, S.; Sawyer, S.; ''et al.''| title=The complete genome sequence of a Neanderthal from the Altai Mountains| journal=Nature| year=2013| volume=505| issue=7481| pages=43<U+2013>49| doi=10.1038/nature12886}}</ref> The Denisovan genome shared more derived alleles with the Altai Neanderthal genome from Siberia than with the Vindija Neanderthal genome from Croatia and the Mezmaiskaya Neanderthal genome from the Caucasus, suggesting that the gene flow came from a population that was more closely related to the Altai Neanderthal.<ref name=prualtai/>

It has also been observed that the Denisovan genome comprises a component derived from an unknown hominin that diverged long before the modern human/Neanderthal/Denisovan separated, suggesting a possible gene flow from said unknown hominin to Denisovans or a population sub-structure.<ref name=prualtai/>
