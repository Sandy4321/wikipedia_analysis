'''Donald "Donn" Cabral''' is an American [[Cross country running|cross country]] and [[track and field]] athlete from Connecticut who went on to star at [[Princeton University]].  As a long distance runner he has been most successful in the [[Steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]], but has also been a [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[All-American]] at cross country and the [[5000 metres]] as well as the [[Ivy League]] champion at the [[3000 metres]].
