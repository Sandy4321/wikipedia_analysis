'''''The Emancipation of Mimi''''' is the tenth [[studio album]] by American singer and songwriter [[Mariah Carey]], released in the United States on April 12, 2005, through [[Island Records]]. Following the relatively poor critical and commercial reception to her eighth and ninth studio albums ''[[Glitter (soundtrack)|Glitter]]'' (2001) and ''[[Charmbracelet]]'' (2002), ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' was considered Carey's "comeback album" by critics and became her highest-selling release in the US in a decade.<ref name=comm>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/267631/ask-billboard-madonna-vs-whitney-vs-mariah|title=Ask Billboard: Madonna vs. Whitney ... vs. Mariah|last=Trust|first=Gary|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=January 7, 2006|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref> In composing the album, the singer collaborated with many songwriters and producers throughout 2004, including [[Jermaine Dupri]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Twista]], [[Nelly]], [[Pharrell Williams]] and James "Big Jim" Wright, many of whom appeared as featured guests on select tracks.

Carey opted to use her personal nickname 'Mimi' in the title, revealing a more intimate side of the singer, as seen in the album's declarative theme of emancipation from her personal and commercial setbacks. Although it has similar vocal production to her previous works and an inclination towards her signature ballads, the album encompasses dance-oriented and uptempo styles in keeping with its celebratory motif. Critics noted the theme of independence and lack of restraint, dubbing the album a "party" record.<ref name=slant/> In contrast to the [[R&B music|R&B]] and [[adult contemporary]] music styles that framed her previous releases, ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' showcases a wider range of genres, exploring [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]-related styles, such as 1970s retro [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[soul music|soul]].

''The Emancipation of Mimi'' received generally positive reviews; critics billed it as Carey's best vocal performance in years and an improvement from ''Charmbracelet''. The album debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with the highest first-week sales of Carey's career at the time. It entered in the top five on the albums charts in Argentina, Canada, Denmark, France, and Japan, as well as on the European chart. ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' was the best-selling album of 2005 in the US, and the second-best seller worldwide. By April 2008, it had sold more than 12&nbsp;million copies.

Carey achieved international success with the first two singles from the album. "[[It's Like That (Mariah Carey song)|It's Like That]]" became one of her highest-charting songs in years, reaching the top twenty in several countries. "[[We Belong Together]]" accumulated 14 weeks at number one in the US, and was later hailed "song of the decade" by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.<ref name=songof/> It reached number one in Australia, number two in New Zealand, and achieved top-five positions in several European countries. To promote the album, Carey performed at the [[48th Grammy Awards]], the [[MTV Movie Awards 2005]], the [[2005 MTV Video Music Awards]] and the [[American Music Awards of 2005]]. In 2006, she embarked on her sixth concert tour, [[The Adventures of Mimi Tour|The Adventures of Mimi]].

== Background ==
In 2001, Carey had experienced critical, commercial, personal and professional struggles, following the poor reception to her debut film ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'' (2001).<ref name=careyon>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/983024561.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Feb+05%2C+2006&author=Joan+Anderman%2C+GLOBE+STAFF&pub=Boston+Globe&desc=CAREY%2C+ON!&pqatl=google|title=Carey, On!|last=Anderson|first=Joan|work=[[Boston Globe]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=February 6, 2006|accessdate=May 13, 2011}}</ref> The picture was panned by critics and earned less than eight million dollars at the box office.<ref name="Mayer">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/carey.html|title=Carey On|last=Meyer|first=Andre|publisher=[[CBC News]].

The company paid her $50&nbsp;million to part ways.<ref name="Mayer"/> Carey flew to [[Capri]], Italy, after her two-week hospitalization.<ref name="Vineyard"/> During her five-month stay, she began to write a new [[studio album]], using experiences she had gone through in recent months as inspirational themes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1077026,00.html|title=Working Vacation Revitalizes Mariah|last=Todd|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|date=November 26, 2002|accessdate=May 10, 2011}}</ref> After being signed by [[Island Records]] and starting her own imprint, [[MonarC Entertainment]], Carey released her intended "comeback" album ''[[Charmbracelet]]''.<ref name="Vineyard"/> Critics deemed it a strong improvement over ''Glitter'', but not something that would re-establish her popularity as in the early stages of her career.<ref name="Mayer"/>

After enduring three years of "carping" from critics, Carey planned her return to music.<ref name="Mayer"/> On November 18,&nbsp;2004, she revealed on her website that the name of the album would be ''The Emancipation of Mimi''.<ref name="Vineyard1">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1493885/mariah-reveals-personal-nickname-new-lp.jhtml|title=Janet Has Damita Jo, Madonna Has Esther <U+2013> Now, Mariah Has 'Mimi'|publisher=[[MTV News]]. [[Viacom]]|accessdate=February 24, 2011|date=November 18, 2004|first=Jennifer|last=Vineyard}}</ref> While Carey was recording the album, Island Records executive [[L.A. Reid]] had learned that close friends referred to the singer as "Mimi". He had told Carey, "I feel your spirit on this record. You should use that name in the title, because that's the fun side of you that people don't get to see <U+2013> the side that can laugh at the diva jokes, laugh at the breakdown jokes, laugh at whatever they want to say about you and just live life and enjoy it."<ref name="Vineyard"/> Carey explained that Mimi is a "very personal nickname" only used by those in her inner circle, and thus the title meant she was letting her guard down and inviting her fans to be that much closer to her.<ref name="Vineyard"/> She thought that naming her album ''The Emancipation of Mariah Carey'' would be "obnoxious".<ref name="Vineyard"/>

== Writing and recording ==
During a visit to a recording studio, Carey was given a beat by [[The Legendary Traxster]].<ref name=all>{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/2005/04/21/mariah-carey-make-it-happen/|title=Mariah Carey: Make It Happen|last=Williams|first=Houston|publisher=[[AllHipHop]]. AHH Holdings|date=April 12, 2005|accessdate=January 9, 2011}}</ref> On a later date, she met with American rapper [[Twista]] backstage after a show.<ref name=all/> When Carey mentioned the track, Twista told her that the beat had been originally intended for him, and that he had already written lyrics for it. They decided to collaborate on the track, which later was titled "One and Only".<ref name=all/> In the following months, Carey wrote and co-produced several songs including "[[Say Somethin' (Mariah Carey song)|Say Somethin']] (with [[Snoop Dogg]] and [[The Neptunes]]), "To the Floor" (with [[Nelly]]), and "[[Fly Like a Bird]]" with James "Big Jim" Wright.<ref name=happy/><ref name=flab/> By November, she felt that she had composed enough good material for ''The Emancipation of Mimi''.<ref name=mtvnews3>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1522707/road-grammys-mariah-carey.jhtml?headlines=true|title=Road To The Grammys: The Story Behind Mariah Carey's 'We Belong Together'|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|publisher=[[MTV News]]. [[Viacom]]|date=May 18, 2006|accessdate=May 10, 2011}}</ref> After Reid listened to the album, however, he suggested the singer compose a few more "strong" singles to ensure the project's commercial success.<ref name=mtvnews3/> Based on his recommendation, Carey met with [[Jermaine Dupri]] in Atlanta for a brief studio session, since Reid felt she had written some of her best work with him.<ref name=mtvnews3/> During this two-day trip, Carey and Dupri wrote and produced "[[Shake It Off]]" and "[[Get Your Number]]", which were released as the album's third and fourth singles.<ref name=mtvnews3/> Following this recording session, "Shake It Off" was briefly selected as the album's lead single, replacing the other contenders, "Stay The Night" and "Say Somethin'".<ref name=mtvnews3/> Carey later returned to Atlanta for a second meeting with Dupri; they then penned the last two songs for the album: "[[We Belong Together]]" and "[[It's Like That (Mariah Carey song)|It's Like That]]".<ref name=mtvnews3/> In an interview for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Carey described her sentiments regarding "It's Like That" during the production stage:
<blockquote>
I had the chills. I had a great feeling about it when we finished writing the song, and I was flying back from Atlanta at some crazy hour of the morning ... But we were listening to it on the plane ride on the way home, and even from the demo version, I really felt something very special.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2BQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA31&dq=mariah+carey+%22we+belong+together%22+fourteen+weeks&hl=en&ei=uPgvTobMIZCitgeKwKSkCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Race For Record Of The Year, A Close Call|last=Martens|first=Todd|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=January 7, 2006|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref>
</blockquote>
Carey and her management then decided to release "It's Like That" as the album's lead single, calling it "the right fire-starter".<ref name=mtvnews3/> The singer has praised Dupri for being "focused", and felt that together they had composed some of her favorite songs on the album.<ref name=mtvnews3/> She has told [[MTV]], "The album is not about making the older executives happy by making a bring-down-the-house, tearjerker ballad, or [something] steeped in the media dramas of my life. What I tried to do was keep the sessions very sparse, underproduced, like in '70s soul music ...

== Musical style ==
''The Emancipation of Mimi'' was Carey's most expressive album to that point according to [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]; it signified her creative freedom, as she had been oppressed by the expectations of record executives in the past.<ref name=exec>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,153124,00.html|title=Mariah Prepares 'The Emancipation of Mimi'|last=Friedman|first=Roger|publisher=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]. [[News Corporation]]|date=February 9, 2006|accessdate=June 30, 2011}}</ref> They noted the album's motif of professional and cultural emancipation throughout many songs. In an interview with the ''[[Hartford Courant]]'', Carey spoke about the album's lack of creative restraint she felt was not featured on ''Charmbracelet''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/1464224001.html?dids=1464224001:1464224001&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+17%2C+2008&author=Anonymous&pub=Hartford+Courant&desc=NEW+ON+DISC&pqatl=google|title=New on Disc|work=[[Hartford Courant]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=April 17, 2008|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}</ref> The latter album harbored on reviving Carey's popularity among the adult contemporary audience, following her decline with ''Glitter'', which found the singer [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] 1980s melodies.<ref name=lost>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MQ0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA29&dq=While+fans+of+her+early-'90s+material+will+find+much+to+embrace+here,+those+that+rallied+'round+the+singer+during+her+hip-hop+days+may+feel+lost+and+abandoned&hl=en&ei=OlL3TbGrDcPJgQetyfH9Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Reviews and Previews|last=Paoletta|first=Michael|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=December 14, 2002|accessdate= September 3, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/glitter-mw0000010437|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=Glitter|publisher=[[Allmusic]]. [[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=October 2, 2010}}</ref> While featuring ballads similar to those on ''Charmbracelet'', the songs on ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' drew influence from R&B and hip hop, and were composed at an elevated tempo.<ref name=vibe/> According to Dimitri Ehrlich, an editor from ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'', the album includes many musical facets:
<blockquote>
''Mimi'' pulls Carey in two opposite directions. Most of the tracks find her paired with the hottest hip hop producers of the day; there, she exercises restraint and settles into a groove. But on the rest, she does what comes most naturally to her<U+2014>belting to her heart's desire, perhaps to mollify those who don't care much for her detours into raunchier rap territory.<ref name=vibe/>
</blockquote>
''The Emancipation of Mimi'' explores various genres; Greg Kot of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' felt that the album effectively combines "elements of hip-hop and rhythm and blues into pop songs that appeal to a broad cross-section of listeners."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/939117331.html?dids=939117331:939117331&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Dec+09%2C+2005&author=Greg+Kot%2C+Tribune+music+critic+Tribune+arts+critic+Howard+Reich+contributed+to+this+report&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=Grammys+dig+West+%3B+Bold-talking+Chicago+star+grabs+8+nominations%3B+'Mimi'+leads+Mariah+to+8+nods%3B+50+Cent%2C+Beyonce%2C+U2%2C+Springsteen%2C+Stefani+also+score&pqatl=google|title=Grammys Dig West, Carey|last=Kot|first=Greg|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=November 15, 2005|accessdate=May 12, 2011}}</ref> Aside from the ballads and uptempo tracks, ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' incorporates elements of [[Soul music|soul]] and 1970s-inspired genres, evident on the [[Gospel music|gospel]]-tinged closing track, "Fly Like a Bird".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/820758661.html?dids=820758661:820758661&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+12%2C+2005&author=LARRY+KATZ&pub=Boston+Herald&desc=MUSIC%3B+Carey+tries+to+break+free+of+past+with+`Emancipation'&pqatl=google|title=Music; Carey Tries to Break Free of past With 'Emancipation'|last=Katz|first=Larry|work=[[Boston Herald]]|publisher=Herald Media|date=September 10, 2005|accessdate=May 10, 2011}}</ref> While most tracks derive instrumentation from live bands and musical instruments, some of the uptempo songs feature computerized arrangements and synthesizers.<ref name=popmatters/> Stylistically, critics considered the album Carey's most diverse record in years, and one that highlighted many different production choices and techniques.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nypost/access/1462349371.html?dids=1462349371:1462349371&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+15%2C+2008&author=DAN+AQUILANTE&pub=New+York+Post&desc=SINGLE+HER+OUT!+-+MARIAH'S+UPBEAT+AND+RECORD-SETTING&pqatl=google|title=Single Her Out; Mariah's Up-Beat and Record-Setting|last=Starr|first=Michael|work=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=May 10, 2005|accessdate=May 10, 2011}}</ref>

With this tour, I'm going to be working on some different arrangements for some of the older songs, to&nbsp;... give it a little more life to them.

The tour received a generally mixed reception from critics; while the singer's vocals were deemed a highlight, reviewers felt the show's excesses, such as the singer's frequent costume changes and pre-filmed clips, were distracting.<ref name=outshines>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1537972/mariah-carey-tour-kickoff-all-about-voice.jhtml|title=Mariah Carey Tour Kickoff: The Voice Outshines Costume Changes, Video Clips|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|publisher=[[MTV News]].

[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=February 5, 2011}}</ref> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] called the album a "highly crafted piece of dance-pop" and "relative comeback" for Carey, although it is not as "catchy" as he thought it should have been.<ref name=allm>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r729111|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Emancipation of Mimi > Overview|publisher=[[Allmusic]].

Jennifer Vineyard of [[MTV News]] considered the album's title to draw influence from [[Janet Jackson]]'s ''[[Damita Jo (album)|Damita Jo]]'', which was also based on an alternate persona.<ref>{{cite web|url= |title=Janet Has Damita Jo, Madonna Has Esther <U+2014> Now, Mariah Has 'Mimi'|work=MTV News|publisher=Vineyard, Jennifer|date=November 18, 2004|accessdate=December 28, 2013}}</ref> According to Jenson Macey from [[BBC News]], ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' was Carey's strongest effort from the 2000s; he said that the album "took her straight back to the top of the A-List."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4690602.stm|title=The Fall and Rise of Mariah Carey|publisher=BBC News.

He felt the record's sound was fresh and innovative: "on ''The Emancipation of Mimi'', she disciplines herself into coherence, using fewer tricks and sounding more believable. She also finds what lesser singers can take for granted: a certain lightness that eases her constant sense of control."<ref name=nyc/> Cummings from PopMatters gave the album seven stars out of ten, claiming it to be Carey's redemption from the manacles of her previous two releases.<ref name=pop/> He praised the album's singles, but called some of its music "corny" and "unnecessarily overproduced".<ref name=pop/> Todd Burns from Stylus Magazine gave the album a B<U+2212>, admiring its assortment of beats and tempos.<ref name=stylus/> Burns, however, called some of The Neptunes and Dupri's production "ill-advised".<ref name=stylus/> He called some of Carey's vocals "strained, thin and airy".<ref name=stylus/> While considering it as an improvement over her previous releases of the decade, he concluded that it "suffers from the fact that her vocals have deteriorated <U+2013> a simple fact of the ravages that her voice has undergone in the past fifteen years."<ref name=stylus/> Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' three and a half stars out of five, calling it "redemption". He complimented its array of beats and its production.<ref name=slant/> Critic Andre Meyer of [[CBS|CBS News]] thought the material on the album was "stronger" than on ''Charmbracelet'', and described it as a move in Carey's long-term plan for pop domination, while giving off the "jittery R&B vibe that made Destiny's Child so potent."<ref name="Mayer"/> He added that "Mariah has returned to singing <U+2013> while still pushing the limits of good taste with her barely there outfits."<ref name="Mayer"/>
