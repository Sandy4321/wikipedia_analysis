The '''waltz''' is a smooth, progressive [[ballroom dance|ballroom]] and [[folk dance|folk]] [[dance]] in {{audio|3-4_rhythm_metre_meter_time_measure.ogg|triple}} [[Time signature|time]], performed primarily in [[closed position]].

== History == 
There are several references to a sliding or gliding dance,- a waltz, from the 16th century including the representations of the printer H.S. Beheim. The French philosopher [[Montaigne]] wrote of a dance he saw in 1580 in [[Augsburg]], where the dancers held each other so closely that their faces touched. Kunz Haas, of approximately the same period wrote that, "Now they are dancing the godless, ''Weller'' or ''Spinner''."<ref name="Nettl, Paul page 211">Nettl, Paul. Birth of the Waltz, in Dance Index vol 5, no. 9. 1946 New York: Dance Index-Ballet Caravan, Inc. page 211</ref> "The vigorous peasant dancer, following an instinctive knowledge of the weight of fall, utilizes his surplus energy to press all his strength into the proper beat of the measure, thus intensifying his personal enjoyment in dancing".<ref>Nettl, Paul. Birth of the Waltz, in Dance Index vol 5, no. 9. 1946 New York: Dance Index-Ballet Caravan, Inc. pages 208, 211</ref>

The peasants of Bavaria, Tyrol, and Styria began dancing a dance called Walzer, a dance for couples, around 1750. The [[L<U+00E4>ndler]], also known as the Schleifer, a country dance in 3/4 time, was popular in Bohemia, Austria, and Bavaria, and spread from the countryside to the suburbs of the city. While the eighteenth century upper classes continued to dance the [[minuet]], bored noblemen slipped away to the balls of their servants.<ref>A Dictionary of Music and Musicians (A.D. 1450<U+2013>1880)  By George Grove, Sir George Grove, John Alexander Fuller-Maitland, Adela Harriet Sophia (Bagot) Wodehouse. Published 1889. Macmillan</ref>

In the 1771 German novel ''Geschichte des Fr<U+00E4>uleins von Sternheim'' by [[Sophie von La Roche]], a high-minded character complains about the newly introduced waltz among aristocrats thus: "But when he put his arm around her, pressed her to his breast, cavorted with her in the shameless, indecent whirling-dance of the Germans and engaged in a familiarity that broke all the bounds of good breeding<U+2014>then my silent misery turned into burning rage."<ref>''The History of Lady Sophia Sternheim'', trans. Christa Baguss Britt (State University of New York Press, 1991), p. 160.</ref>

Describing life in Vienna (dated at either 1776 or 1786<ref>Johann Strauss: Father and Son a Century of Light Music By H. E. Jacob. By H. E. Jacob. 2005. page 24 ISBN 1-4179-9311-1</ref>), Don Curzio wrote, " The people were dancing mad [...] The ladies of Vienna are particularly celebrated for their grace and movements of waltzing of which they never tire." There is a waltz in the second act finale of the opera "Una Cosa Rara" written by [[Martin y Soler]] in 1786. Soler's waltz was marked Andante con moto, or "at a walking pace with motion", but the flow of the dance was sped-up in Vienna leading to the Geschwindwalzer, and the Galloppwalzer.<ref>The Waltz Emperors. Wechsberg. 1973. C. Tinling & Company. page 49, 50)</ref><ref>A Dictionary of Music and Musicians (A.D. 1450<U+2013>1880) By George Grove, Sir George Grove, John Alexander Fuller-Maitland, Adela Harriet Sophia (Bagot) Wodehouse. Published 1889. Macmillan. page 385</ref>

In the transition from country to town, the hopping of the L<U+00E4>ndler, a dance known as Langaus, became a sliding step, and gliding rotation replaced stamping rotation.<ref>Johann Strauss: Father and Son a Century of Light Music By H. E. Jacob. By H. E. Jacob. 2005. page 25 ISBN 1-4179-9311-1</ref>

In the 19th century the word primarily indicated that the dance was a turning one; one would "waltz" in the [[polka]] to indicate rotating rather than going straight forward without turning.

The Viennese custom is to slightly anticipate the second beat, which conveys a faster, lighter rhythm, and also breaks of the phrase. The younger Strauss would sometimes break up the one-two-three of the melody with a one-two pattern in the accompaniment along with other rhythms, maintaining the 3/4 time while causing the dancers to dance a two-step waltz. The metronome speed for a full bar varies between 60 and 70, with the waltzes of the first Strauss often played faster than those of his sons.<ref>The Waltz Emperors. Wechsberg. 1973. C. Tinling & Company. pages 59<U+2013>61</ref>

Shocking many when it was first introduced,<ref>Mozart: A Cultural Biography By Robert W. Gutman. 1999. Harcourt. Pages 44<U+2013>45</ref> the waltz became fashionable in [[Vienna]] around the 1780s, spreading to many other countries in the years to follow. It became fashionable in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the [[British Regency|Regency period]], having been made respectable by the endorsement of  [[Dorothea Lieven]], wife of the Russian ambassador.<ref>Boyd Hilton, ''A Mad, Bad, and Dangerous People? England 1783<U+2013>1846'' (Oxford U P 2006).</ref> [[Almack's]], the most exclusive club in London, permitted the waltz from about 1812 on, though the entry in the Oxford English Dictionary shows that it was considered "riotous and indecent" as late as 1825. The waltz, and especially its closed position, became the example for the creation of many other ballroom dances. Subsequently, new types of waltz have developed, including many folk and several ballroom dances.

In the 19th and early 20th century, numerous different waltz forms existed, including versions performed in 2/4 or 6/8 (sauteuse), and 5/4 time (5/4 waltz, half and half)

In the 1910s, a form called the '''"Hesitation Waltz"''' was introduced by [[Vernon and Irene Castle]].<ref name="hes_waltz">{{cite web |url=http://www.danceintime.com/historyAmerica.htm |title=The History of Ballroom Dance in America |first= |last= |accessdate=2010-12-13}}</ref> It incorporated Hesitations and was danced to fast music. A hesitation is basically a halt on the standing foot during the full waltz measure, with the moving foot suspended in the air or slowly dragged. Similar figures ([[Hesitation Change]], [[Drag Hesitation]], and [[Cross Hesitation]]) are incorporated in the [[International Standard (dance)|International Standard]] Waltz Syllabus.

The '''Country Western Waltz''' is mostly progressive, moving counter clock wise around the dance floor. Both the posture and frame are relaxed, with posture bordering on a slouch. The exaggerated hand and arm gestures of some ballroom styles are not part of this style. Couples may frequently dance in the [[promenade position]], depending on local preferences. Within Country Western waltz there are the Spanish Waltz and the more modern (for the late 1930s- early 1950s) Pursuit Waltz. At one time it was considered ill treatment for a man to make the woman walk backwards in some locations.<ref>Cowboy Dances. Lloyd Shaw. 1939-1952. The Caxton Printers. pages 101-103. no ISBN</ref>

In California the waltz was banned by Mission fathers until after 1834 because of the "closed" dance position.<ref name="Early California Days 1950. page 44">Dances of Early California Days. Lucile K. Czarnoski. 1950. Pacific Books. page 44.</ref> Thereafter a Spanish Waltz was danced. This Spanish Waltz was a combination of dancing around the room in closed position, and a "formation" dance of two couples facing each other and performing a sequence of steps.<ref name="Early California Days 1950. page 44" /> "Valse a Trois Temps" was the "earliest" waltz step, and the Rye Waltz was favored as a couple dance.<ref>Dances of Early California Days. Lucile K. Czarnoski. 1950. Pacific Books. page 121.</ref>

* In contemporary [[ballroom dance]], the fast versions of the waltz are called [[Viennese Waltz]].
* In [[traditional Irish music]], the waltz was taught by traveling dancing masters to those who could afford their lessons during the 19th century. By the end of that century, the dance spread to the middle and lower classes of Irish society and traditional triple-tune tunes and songs were altered to fit the waltz rhythm. During the 20th century, the waltz found a distinctively Irish playing style in the hands of [[C<U+00E9>ilidh]] musicians at [[Ceili dance|dances]].<ref>Vallely, F. (1999). The Companion to Traditional Irish Music. New York University Press: New York, p. 431-433</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtune.info/rhythm/ |title=Rhythm Definitions - Irish Traditional Music Tune Index |publisher=Irishtune.info |date=2012-07-11 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>
* [[Waltz (International Standard)|International Standard Waltz]] has only closed figures; that is, the couple never breaks the embrace.
* The [[American Style Waltz]], part of the [[American Smooth]] ballroom dance syllabus, in contrast to the [[International Standard (dance)|International Standard]] Waltz, involves breaking contact almost entirely in some figures. For example, the Syncopated Side-by-Side with Spin includes a free spin for both partners. Open rolls are another good example of an [[Ballroom glossary#Open dance figure|open dance figure]], in which the follower alternates between the lead's left and right sides, with the lead's left or right arm (alone) providing the lead. Waltzes were the staple of many American musicals and films, including "Waltz in Swing Time" sung by [[Fred Astaire]].
* The [[Scandinavia]]n Waltz, performed as a part of [[Scandinavian folk dance]], can be fast or slow, but the dancers are always rotating.
*The [[Vals (Peruvian)|Peruvian Waltz]] is called and recognized in Peru as ''vals criollo''.
* The [[Mexican Waltz]] (''vals mexicano'') follows the same basic rhythmic pattern as the standard waltz, but the melodies reflect a strong Spanish influence. Mexico's [[Juventino Rosas]] wrote "[[Sobre las Olas]]" or "Over the Waves", commonly known in the U.S. as a circus song played during a trapeze show.
* The [[Cajun Waltz]] is danced progressively around the floor, and is characterized by the subtle swaying of the hips and step very close to ordinary walking. It is danced entirely in the closed position.
* The (Cuban or Tropical Waltz) follows the pattern of the standard waltz throughout the song.
*The [[Venezuelan waltz]] provided a basis for distinctive regional musical composition.
* The Contra Waltz (Freeform Waltz), included in most [[contra dance]] evenings, uses both open and closed positions, and incorporates moves from other dances such as [[swing (dance)|swing]], [[modern jive]] and [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]]. Basically the dancers progress around the dance floor with a waltz step, but with no constraints on what moves they can use.
* The [[Bal-musette|Valse Musette]],  a form of waltz popular in France, started in the late 19th century
* The [[cross-step waltz]] (French Valse Boston) developed in France in the early 20th century and is popular in social waltz groups today.
