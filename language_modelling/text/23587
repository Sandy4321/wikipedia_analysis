'''Influenza''', commonly known as the '''flu''', is an [[infectious disease]] of [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s caused by an [[RNA virus]] of the [[biological family|family]] [[Orthomyxoviridae]] (the influenza viruses). In people, common symptoms are [[fever]], [[pharyngitis|sore throat]], [[myalgia|muscle pains]], severe [[headache]], [[cough]]ing, and [[malaise|weakness and fatigue]].<ref name=Merck>{{cite web |author=Merck Manual Home Edition |title=Influenza: Viral Infections |url=http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec17/ch198/ch198c.html?}}</ref> In more serious cases, influenza [[sequela|causes]] [[pneumonia]], which can be fatal particularly in young children and the elderly. Sometimes confused with the [[common cold]], influenza is a much more severe disease and caused by a different type of virus.<ref name=Eccles>{{cite journal | author = Eccles R | title = Understanding the symptoms of the common cold and influenza. | journal = Lancet Infect Dis | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | pages = 718-25 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 16253889}}</ref> Similarly, the unrelated [[gastroenteritis]] is sometimes called "stomach flu" or "24-hour flu".

Typically, influenza is transmitted from infected mammals through the air by coughs or sneezes, creating [[particulate|aerosols]] containing the virus, and from infected birds through their [[feces|droppings]]. Influenza can also be transmitted by [[saliva]], [[mucus|nasal secretions]], [[feces]] and [[blood]]. Infections occur through contact with these bodily fluids or with contaminated surfaces. Flu viruses can remain infectious for over 30 days at 0<U+00B0>C (32<U+00B0>F), about one week at human body temperature, and indefinitely at very cold temperatures (such as lakes in northeast Siberia). They can be inactivated easily by [[disinfectants]] and [[detergents]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Suarez D, Spackman E, Senne D, Bulaga L, Welsch A, Froberg K | title = The effect of various disinfectants on detection of avian influenza virus by real time RT-PCR. | journal = Avian Dis | volume = 47 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 1091-5 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 14575118}}</ref><ref> [http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/biofacts/avflu_human.html CIDRAP] Avian Influenza (Bird Flu): Implications for Human Disease #  Physical characteristics of influenza A viruses</ref><ref> [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=204&objectid=10413124 nzherald] article ''Flu viruses 'can live for decades' on ice'' published November 30, 2006[</ref>

Flu spreads around the world in seasonal [[epidemics]], killing millions of people in [[pandemic]] years and hundreds of thousands in non-pandemic years. Three influenza pandemics occurred in the 20th century<U+2014>each following a major genetic change in the [[virus]]<U+2014>and killed tens of millions of people. Often, these pandemics result from the spread of a flu virus between animal [[species]]. Since it first killed humans in Asia in the 1990s a deadly avian strain of [[H5N1]] has posed the greatest [[influenza pandemic]] threat. However, this virus has not yet [[mutate]]d to spread easily between people.<ref>{{cite web | title=Avian influenza (" bird flu") | url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/avian_influenza/en/ | date=February 2006 | publisher=WHO | accessdate=2006-10-20}} - Fact sheet</ref>

==Etymology==
The term influenza has its origins in fifteenth-century [[Italy]], where the cause of the disease was ascribed to unfavourable [[astrology|astrological]] ''influences''. Evolution in medical thought led to its modification to ''influenza di freddo'', meaning "influence of the cold". The word "influenza" was first attested in English in 1743 when it was borrowed during an outbreak of the disease in Europe.<ref name=Harper>{{cite web | author=Harper D | title=Influenza | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=influenza&searchmode=none  | publisher=etymonline.com - Online [[etymology]] dictionary}}</ref> Archaic terms for influenza include epidemic catarrh, grippe, (sometimes spelt "grip" or "gripe"), sweating sickness and Spanish fever (particularly for the 1918 pandemic strain).<ref>{{cite web | author=Smith P | title=Archaic Medical Terms | url=http://www.paul_smith.doctors.org.uk/ArchaicMedicalTerms.htm  Online dictionary of archaic medical terms.

The symptoms of human influenza were clearly described by [[Hippocrates]] roughly 2400 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal  | author=Martin P, Martin-Granel E | title=2,500-year evolution of the term epidemic | url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no06/05-1263.htm#cit | journal=Emerg Infect Dis | year=2006 | month=Jun | volume=12 | issue=6 | id = PMID 16707055}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Hippocrates | title=Of the Epidemics | url=http://classics.mit.edu/Hippocrates/epidemics.html | format=written 400 BCE and translated by [[Francis Adams (translator)|Francis Adams]] | accessdate=2006-10-18}}</ref> Since then, the virus has caused numerous pandemics. Historical data on influenza are difficult to interpret, as the symptoms can be similar to those of other diseases, such as [[diphtheria]], [[pneumonic plague]], [[typhoid fever]], [[dengue]] or [[typhus]]. The first convincing record of an influenza pandemic was of an outbreak in 1580, which began in Asia and spread to Europe via Africa. In Rome over 8,000 people were killed and several Spanish cities were almost wiped out.<ref name=Potter>{{cite journal  | author=Potter CW| title=A History of Influenza | url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-2672.2001.01492.x | journal=J Appl Microbiol. | year=2006 | month=Oct | volume=91 | issue=4 | pages = 572-579 | id = PMID 11576290}}</ref> Pandemics continued sporadically throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, with the pandemic of 1830-1833 being particularly widespread; it infected approximately a quarter of the people exposed.<ref name=Potter/>

The most famous and lethal outbreak was the so-called [[Spanish flu]] pandemic ([[Influenzavirus A|type A influenza]], [[H1N1]] subtype), which lasted from 1918 to 1919. Older estimates say it killed 40-50 million people<ref name=Patterson1>{{cite journal  | author=Patterson KD, Pyle GF.| title=The geography and mortality of the 1918 influenza pandemic. | journal=Bull Hist Med. | year=1991 | month=Spring | volume=65 | issue=1 | pages = 4-21 | id = PMID 2021692}}</ref> while current estimates say 50 million to 100 million people worldwide were killed.<ref name=Knobler>{{cite book | editor=Knobler S, Mack A, Mahmoud A, Lemon S (Editors) | title=The Threat of Pandemic Influenza: Are We Ready?

One observer wrote, "One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine. Bleeding from the ears and petechial hemorrhages in the skin also occurred."<ref name=Knobler/> The majority of deaths were from [[bacterial pneumonia]], a [[secondary infection]] caused by influenza, but the virus also killed people directly, causing massive [[bleeding|hemorrhages]] and [[edema]] in the lung.<ref name=Taubenberger>{{cite journal | author = Taubenberger J, Reid A, Janczewski T, Fanning T | title = Integrating historical, clinical and molecular genetic data in order to explain the origin and virulence of the 1918 Spanish influenza virus. | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 356 | issue = 1416 | pages = 1829-39 | year = 2001 | month=Dec 29 | id = PMID 11779381 | url=http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/(3sud2455cjw1ut55yowx1d45)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&backto=issue,3,22;journal,61,225;linkingpublicationresults,1:102022,1}}</ref>

The Spanish flu pandemic was truly global, spreading even to the Arctic and remote Pacific islands. The unusually severe disease killed between 2 and 20 % of those infected, as opposed to the more usual flu epidemic [[mortality rate]] of 0.1 %.<ref name=Taubenberger/><ref name=Knobler/> Another unusual feature of this pandemic was that it mostly killed young adults, with 99% of pandemic influenza deaths occurring in people under 65 and more than half in young adults 20 to 40 years old.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Simonsen L, Clarke M, Schonberger L, Arden N, Cox N, Fukuda K | title = Pandemic versus epidemic influenza mortality: a pattern of changing age distribution. | journal = J Infect Dis | volume = 178 | issue = 1 | pages = 53-60 | year = 1998 | month=Jul | id = PMID 9652423}}</ref> This is unusual since influenza is normally most deadly to the very young (under age 2) and the very old (over age 70). The total mortality of the 1918-1919 pandemic is not known, but it is estimated that 2.5 % to 5 % of the world's population was killed. As many as 25 million may have been killed in the first 25 weeks; in contrast, [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]] has killed 25 million in its first 25 years.<ref name=Knobler/>

Later flu pandemics were not so devastating. They included the 1957 [[Asian Flu]] (type A, [[H2N2]] strain) and the 1968 [[Hong Kong Flu]] (type A, [[H3N2]] strain), but even these smaller outbreaks killed millions of people. In contrast to 1918 Spanish flu, in later pandemics [[antibiotics]] were available to control secondary infections, and this may have helped reduce mortality.<ref name=Taubenberger/>

The [[etiology|etiological]] cause of influenza, the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses, was first discovered in pigs by [[Richard Schope]] in 1931.<ref>{{cite journal  | author=Shimizu K. | title=History of influenza epidemics and discovery of influenza virus | journal=Nippon Rinsho. | year=1997 | month=Oct | volume=55 | issue=10| pages=2505-201 | id = PMID 9360364}}</ref> This discovery was shortly followed by the isolation of the virus from humans by a group headed by [[Patrick Laidlaw]] at the [[Medical Research Council]] of the [[United Kingdom]] in 1933.<ref>{{cite journal  | author=Smith W, Andrewes CH, Laidlaw PP.| title=A virus obtained from influenza patients. | journal=Lancet. | year=1933 | volume=2 pages = 66-68}}</ref> However, it was not until [[Wendell Stanley]] first crystallised [[tobacco mosaic virus]] in 1935 that the [[cell (biology)|non-cellular]] nature of viruses was appreciated.

The first significant step towards preventing influenza was the discovery by [[Thomas Francis, Jr.]] in 1944 of a live vaccine for influenza. This built on work by [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet]], who showed that the virus lost virulence when it was cultured in fertilised hen's eggs.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1960/burnet-bio.html Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet: Biography] The Nobel Foundation. Accessed 22 Oct 06</ref> Application of this observation by Francis allowed his group of researchers at the [[University of Michigan]] to develop the first [[flu vaccine]], with support from the U.S. army.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kendall H | title =  Vaccine Innovation: Lessons from World War II. | url=http://docstore.ingenta.com/cgi-bin/ds_deliver/1/u/d/ISIS/32620254.1/pal/jphp/2006/00000027/00000001/art00005/FB2494BF0313967611615398189A7A906334373166.pdf?link=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/error/delivery&format=pdf | journal = Journal of Public Health Policy | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 38-57 | year = 2006}}</ref> The U.S. army was deeply involved in this research due to its experience of influenza in World War I, when thousands of troops were killed by the virus in a matter of months.<ref name=Knobler/>

Although there were scares in [[New Jersey]] in 1976 (with the [[Swine Flu]]), world-wide in 1977 (with the [[Russian Flu]]), and in [[Hong Kong]] and other Asian countries in 1997 (with [[H5N1]] avian influenza), there have been no major pandemics since the 1968 Hong Kong Flu. Immunity to previous pandemic influenza strains and vaccination may have limited the spread of the virus, and may have helped prevent further pandemics.<ref name=Hilleman/>

===Types of influenza virus===
The influenza virus is an [[RNA]] [[virus]] of the family [[Orthomyxoviridae]], which comprises the influenzaviruses, [[Isavirus]] and [[Thogotovirus]]. There are three types of influenza virus: [[Influenzavirus A]], [[Influenzavirus B]] or [[Influenzavirus C]]. Influenza A and C infect multiple species, while influenza B almost exclusively infects humans.<ref name=hay>{{cite journal | author = Hay A, Gregory V, Douglas A, Lin Y | title = The evolution of human influenza viruses. | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 356 | issue = 1416 | pages = 1861-70 | year = 2001 | month=Dec 29 | id = PMID 11779385 | url=http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/media/hf0bujxwvrcxd7nwdrwq/contributions/l/x/y/v/lxyv2p8w45geev90.pdf | format=PDF}}</ref>
The type A viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the three influenza types and cause the most severe disease. The Influenza A virus can be subdivided into different [[serotype]]s based on the [[antibody]] response to these viruses.<ref name=hay/> The serotypes that have been confirmed in humans, ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths, are:

*[[H1N1]] caused "[[Spanish Flu]]".
*[[H2N2]] caused "Asian Flu".
*[[H3N2]] caused "Hong Kong Flu".
*[[H5N1]] is a [[pandemic]] threat in 2006-7 flu season.
*[[H7N7]] has unusual zoonotic potential.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fouchier R, Schneeberger P, Rozendaal F, Broekman J, Kemink S, Munster V, Kuiken T, Rimmelzwaan G, Schutten M, Van Doornum G, Koch G, Bosman A, Koopmans M, Osterhaus A | title = Avian influenza A virus (H7N7) associated with human conjunctivitis and a fatal case of acute respiratory distress syndrome. | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/101/5/1356 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 101 | issue = 5 | pages = 1356-61 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 14745020}}</ref>
*[[H1N2]] is endemic in humans and pigs.
*[[H9N2]], [[H7N2]], [[H7N3]], [[H10N7]].

Influenza B virus is almost exclusively a human pathogen, and is less common than influenza A. The only other animal known to be susceptible to influenza B infection is the seal.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Osterhaus A, Rimmelzwaan G, Martina B, Bestebroer T, Fouchier R | title = Influenza B virus in seals. | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1051-3 | year = 2000 | id = PMID 10807575}}</ref> This type of influenza mutates at a rate 2-3 times lower than type A<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nobusawa E, Sato K | title = Comparison of the mutation rates of human influenza A and B viruses. | journal = J Virol | volume = 80 | issue = 7 | pages = 3675-8 | year = 2006 | month=Apr | id = PMID 16537638}}</ref> and consequently is less genetically diverse, with only one influenza B serotype.<ref name=hay/> As a result of this lack of [[antigen|antigenic]] diversity, a degree of immunity to influenza B is usually acquired at an early age.

Newly-synthesised viral proteins are either secreted through the [[Golgi apparatus]] onto the cell surface (in the case of neuraminidase and hemagglutinin, step 5b) or transported back into the nucleus to bind vRNA and form new viral genome particles (step 5a). Other viral proteins have multiple actions in the host cell, including degrading cellular [[mRNA]] and using the released [[nucleotide]]s for vRNA synthesis and also inhibiting [[translation]] of host-cell mRNAs.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kash J, Goodman A, Korth M, Katze M | title = Hijacking of the host-cell response and translational control during influenza virus infection. | journal = Virus Res | volume = 119 | issue = 1 | pages = 111-20 | year = 2006 | month=Jul | id = PMID 16630668}}</ref>

Negative-sense vRNAs that form the [[genome]]s of future viruses, RNA-dependent RNA transcriptase, and other viral proteins are assembled into a virion. Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules cluster into a bulge in the cell membrane. The vRNA and viral core proteins leave the nucleus and enter this membrane protrusion (step 6). The mature virus buds off from the cell in a sphere of host phospholipid membrane, acquiring hemagglutinin and neuraminidase with this membrane coat (step 7).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nayak D, Hui E, Barman S | title = Assembly and budding of influenza virus. | journal = Virus Res | volume = 106 | issue = 2 | pages = 147-65 | year = 2004 | month=Dec | id = PMID 15567494}}</ref> As before, the viruses adhere to the cell through hemagglutinin; the mature viruses detach once their [[neuraminidase]] has cleaved sialic acid residues from the host cell.<ref name=Wagner/> After the release of new influenza virus, the host cell dies.

Because of the absence of RNA [[proofread]]ing enzymes, the RNA-dependent RNA transcriptase makes a single nucleotide insertion error roughly every 10 thousand nucleotides, which is the approximate length of the influenza vRNA. Hence, nearly every newly-manufactured influenza virus is a mutant.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Drake J | title = Rates of spontaneous mutation among RNA viruses. | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 90 | issue = 9 | pages = 4171-5 | year = 1993 | month=May 1 | id = PMID 8387212}}</ref> The separation of the genome into eight separate segments of vRNA allows mixing or ''reassortment'' of vRNAs if more than one viral line has infected a single cell. The resulting rapid change in viral genetics produces [[antigenic shift]]s and allow the virus to infect new host species and quickly overcome protective immunity.<ref name=Hilleman/> This is important in the emergence of pandemics, as discussed in the Epidemiology section.

== Diagnosis==
In humans, influenza's effects are much more severe than those of the [[common cold]], and last longer. Recovery takes about one to two weeks. Influenza can be deadly, especially for the weak, old or chronically ill.<ref name=Hilleman/>

===Symptoms===
According to the on-line version of the [[Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy]]:
:"Symptoms start 24 to 48 hours after infection and can begin suddenly. Chills or a chilly sensation are often the first indication of influenza. Fever is common during the first few days, and the temperature may rise to 102 to 103 <U+00B0>F (approximately 38 to 39 <U+00B0>C). Many people feel sufficiently ill to remain in bed for days; they have aches and pains throughout the body, most pronounced in the back and legs."<ref name=Merck />

Common symptoms of the flu such as fever, headaches, and fatigue, come from the huge amounts of proinflammatory [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s (such as [[interferon]] or [[tumor necrosis factor]]) produced from influenza-infected cells.<ref name=Eccles/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Schmitz N, Kurrer M, Bachmann M, Kopf M | title = Interleukin-1 is responsible for acute lung immunopathology but increases survival of respiratory influenza virus infection. | journal = J Virol | volume = 79 | issue = 10 | pages = 6441-8 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15858027}}</ref> In contrast to the [[rhinovirus]] that causes the [[common cold]], influenza does cause tissue damage, so symptoms are not entirely due to the inflammatory response.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Winther B, Gwaltney J, Mygind N, Hendley J | title = Viral-induced rhinitis. | journal = Am J Rhinol | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 17-20 | year = | id = PMID 9513654}}</ref>. Symptoms of influenza may include:

:* Body aches, especially joints and throat
:* Coughing and [[sneezing]]
:* Extreme coldness and [[fever]]
:* Fatigue
:* [[Headache]]
:* Irritated watering eyes
:* [[Nasal congestion]]
:* [[Nausea]] and [[vomiting]]
:* Reddened eyes, skin (especially face), mouth, throat and nose

It can be difficult to distinguish between the common cold and influenza in the early stages of these infections.<ref name=Eccles/> The [http://www.sgim.org/clinexam-rce.cfm Rational Clinical Examination] reviewed relevent research on signs and symptoms of influenza <ref name="pmid15728170">{{cite journal | author = Call S, Vollenweider M, Hornung C, Simel D, McKinney W | title = Does this patient have influenza? | journal = JAMA | volume = 293 | issue = 8 | pages = 987-97 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1001/jama.293.8.987 | id = PMID 15728170}}</ref> and found that the best findings for excluding the diagnosis of influenza were:

Notes to table:
* See [[sensitivity and specificity]] for explanation of these terms.
* All three findings, especially fever, were less sensitive in patients over 60 years of age.

Since anti-viral drugs are effective in treating influenza if given early (see treatment section, below), it can be important to identify cases early. Of the symptoms listed above, the combinations of findings below can improve diagnostic accuracy<ref name="pmid11088084">{{cite journal | author = Monto A, Gravenstein S, Elliott M, Colopy M, Schweinle J | title = Clinical signs and symptoms predicting influenza infection. | journal = Arch Intern Med | volume = 160 | issue = 21 | pages = 3243-7 | year = 2000 | url http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/160/21/3243 | id = PMID 11088084}}</ref>. Unfortunately, even combinations of findings are imperfect. However, [[Bayes Theorem]] can combine pretest probability with clinical findings to adequately diagnose or exclude influenza in some patients. The pretest probability has a strong seasonal variation and the current prevalence of influenza among patients receiving sentinel testing is available at the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/). Using the CDC data, the following table shows how the likelihood of influenza varies with prevalence:

Most people who get influenza will recover in one to two weeks, but others will develop life-threatening complications (such as [[pneumonia]]). According to the [[World Health Organization]]: "Every winter, tens of millions of people get the flu. Most are home, sick and miserable, for about a week. Some<U+2014>mostly the elderly<U+2014>die. We know the world-wide death toll exceeds a few hundred thousand people a year, but even in developed countries the numbers are uncertain, because medical authorities don't usually verify who actually died of influenza and who died of a flu-like illness."<ref>Peter M.

The flu can worsen chronic health problems. People with emphysema, chronic bronchitis or asthma may experience shortness of breath while they have the flu, and influenza may cause worsening of [[coronary heart disease]] or [[congestive heart failure]].<ref>Angelo SJ, Marshall PS, Chrissoheris MP, Chaves AM.

===Laboratory Tests===
The available laboratory tests for influenza continues to improve. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) maintains an [http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/labdiagnosis.htm up-to-date summary] of available laboratory tests.  According to the CDC, rapid diagnostic tests have a sensitivity of 70-75% and specificity of 90-95% when compared with viral culture. These tests may be especially useful during the influenza season (prevalence=25%) but in the absence of a local outbreak, or peri-influenza season (prevalence=10%<ref name="pimd12965940"/>).

Accessed 24 Oct. 2006</ref>  The regression curve for deaths is shown extended through the end of November, 2006.]]
===Seasonal variations===
{{further|[[Flu season]]}}
Influenza reaches peak prevalence in [[winter]], and because the [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] and [[Southern Hemisphere]] have winter at different times of the year, there are actually two flu seasons each year.  This is why the [[World Health Organization]] (assisted by the [[National Influenza Centers]]) makes recommendations for two different vaccine formulations every year; one for the Northern, and one for the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name=WHOrecommendation>[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/2007northreport.pdf Recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2006<U+2013>2007 influenza season] WHO report 2006-02-14. Accessed [[19 October]] [[2006]].</ref>

It remains unclear why outbreaks of the flu occur seasonally rather than uniformly throughout the year. One possible explanation is that, because people are indoors more often during the winter, they are in close contact more often, and this promotes transmission from person to person. Another is that cold temperatures lead to drier air, which may dehydrate mucus, preventing the body from effectively expelling virus particles. The virus may also survive longer on exposed surfaces (doorknobs, countertops, etc.) in colder temperatures.  Increased travel and visitation due to the Northern Hemisphere winter holiday season may also play a role.<ref> [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1551913 Weather and the Flu Season] NPR Day to Day, [[December 17]] [[2003]]. Accessed, [[19 October]] [[2006]]</ref> However, seasonal changes in infection rates are also seen in tropical regions and these peaks of infection are seen mainly during the rainy season.<ref> Shek LP, Lee BW. "Epidemiology and seasonality of respiratory tract virus infections in the tropics." ''Paediatr Respir Rev.'' 2003 Jun;4(2):105-11. PMID 12758047</ref> Seasonal changes in contact rates from school-terms, which are a major factor in other childhood diseases such as measles and pertussis, may also play a role in flu. A combination of these small seasonal effects may be amplified by "dynamical resonance" with the endogenous disease cycles.<ref>Dushoff J, Plotkin JB, Levin SA, Earn DJ. "Dynamical resonance can account for seasonality of influenza epidemics." ''Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.'' [[30 November]][[2004]];101(48):16915-6. PMID 15557003</ref> [[H5N1]] exhibits seasonality in both humans and birds.<ref name=WHOH5N1data/>

An alternative hypothesis to explain seasonality in influenza infections is an effect of vitamin D levels on immunity to the virus. <ref>{{cite journal | author = Cannell J, Vieth R, Umhau J, Holick M, Grant W, Madronich S, Garland C, Giovannucci E | title = Epidemic influenza and vitamin D. | journal = Epidemiol Infect | volume = 134 | issue = 6 | pages = 1129-40 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16959053}}</ref> This idea was first proposed by R. Edgar Hope-Simpson in 1965.<ref>{{cite journal | author = HOPE-SIMPSON R | title = The nature of herpes zoster: a long-term study and a new hypothesis. | journal = Proc R Soc Med | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 9-20 | year = | id = PMID 14267505}}</ref> He proposed that the cause of influenza epidemics during winter may be connected to seasonal fluctuations of [[vitamin D]], which is produced in the skin under the influence of solar (or artificial) [[UV radiation]]. This could explain why influenza occurs mostly in winter and during the tropical rainy season, when people stay indoors, away from the sun and their vitamin D levels fall. Furthermore, some studies have suggested that administering cod-liver oil, which contains large amounts of vitamin D, can reduce the incidence of respiratory tract infections.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Linday L, Shindledecker R, Tapia-Mendoza J, Dolitsky J | title = Effect of daily cod liver oil and a multivitamin-mineral supplement with selenium on upper respiratory tract pediatric visits by young, inner-city, Latino children: randomized pediatric sites. | journal = Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol | volume = 113 | issue = 11 | pages = 891-901 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15562899}}</ref>

===Epidemic and pandemic spread===
[[Image:Antigenic drift vs shift.png|thumb|right|400px|[[Antigenic drift]] creates influenza viruses with slightly-modified antigens, while [[antigenic shift]] generates viruses with entirely novel antigens.]]
{{further|[[Flu pandemic]]}}

As influenza is caused by a variety of species and strains of [[virus]]es, in any given year some strains can die out while others create [[epidemic]]s while yet another strain can cause a [[pandemic]]. Typically, in a year's normal two [[flu season]]s (one per hemisphere) there are between three and five million cases of severe illness and up to 500,000 deaths worldwide, which by some definitions is a yearly influenza epidemic.<ref> [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs211/en/ Influenza] WHO Fact sheet N<U+00B0>211 Revised March 2003.

New influenza viruses are constantly being produced by [[mutation]] or by [[reassortment]].<ref name=hay/> Mutations can cause small changes in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase [[antigen]]s on the surface of the virus. This is called [[antigenic drift]], which creates an increasing variety of strains over time until one of the variants eventually achieves higher [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]], becomes dominant, and rapidly sweeps through the human population often causing an epidemic.<ref>{{cite journal | author = | title = Long intervals of stasis punctuated by bursts of positive selection in the seasonal evolution of influenza A virus. | journal = Biol Direct | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 34 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 17067369}}</ref> In contrast, when influenza viruses re-assort, they may acquire new antigens - for example by reassortment between avian strains and human strains. This is called [[antigenic shift]]. If a human influenza virus is produced with entirely novel antigens, everybody will be susceptible and the novel influenza will spread uncontrollably, causing a pandemic.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Parrish C, Kawaoka Y | title = The origins of new pandemic viruses: the acquisition of new host ranges by canine parvovirus and influenza A viruses. | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 553-86 | year = | id = PMID 16153179}}</ref>

== Prevention ==
===Vaccination and hygiene===
{{further|[[Flu vaccine]]}}
[[Image:Vaccination US Navy.jpg|thumb|250px|left|US navy personnel receiving influenza vaccination]]
Vaccination against influenza with a [[flu vaccine]] is strongly recommended for high-risk groups, such as children and the elderly. These vaccines can be produced in several ways; the most common method is to grow the virus in fertilised hen eggs. After purification, the virus is inactivated (for example, by treatment with detergent) to produce an inactivated-virus vaccine. Alternatively, the virus can be grown in eggs until it loses [[virulence]] and the avirulent virus given as a live vaccine.<ref name=Hilleman/> The effectiveness of these flu vaccines is variable. Due to the high mutation rate of the virus, a particular flu vaccine usually confers protection for no more than a few years.  Every year, the [[World Health Organization]] predicts which strains of the virus are most likely to be circulating in the next year, allowing pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines that will provide the best immunity against these strains.<ref name=WHOrecommendation/> Vaccines have also been developed to protect poultry from avian influenza. These vaccines can be effective against multiple strains and are used either as part of a preventative strategy, or combined with culling in attempts to eradicate outbreaks.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Capua I, Alexander D | title = The challenge of avian influenza to the veterinary community. | url=http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/media/gmuaahtvwk6vweuhugdh/contributions/t/2/n/2/t2n2431j4u176p7g.pdf | journal = Avian Pathol | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 189-205 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16753610}}</ref>

It is possible to get vaccinated and still get influenza. The vaccine is reformulated each season for a few specific flu strains, but cannot possibly include all the strains actively infecting people in the world for that season. It takes about six months for the manufacturers to formulate and produce the millions of doses required to deal with the seasonal epidemics; occasionally, a new or overlooked strain becomes prominent during that time and infects people although they have been vaccinated (as by the [[Fujian flu|H3N2 Fujian flu]] in the 2003-2004 flu season).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Holmes E, Ghedin E, Miller N, Taylor J, Bao Y, St George K, Grenfell B, Salzberg S, Fraser C, Lipman D, Taubenberger J | title = Whole-genome analysis of human influenza A virus reveals multiple persistent lineages and reassortment among recent H3N2 viruses. | journal = PLoS Biol | volume = 3 | issue = 9 | pages = e300 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 16026181}}</ref> It is also possible to get infected just before vaccination and get sick with the very strain that the vaccine is supposed to prevent, as the vaccine takes about two weeks to become effective.<ref name=CDCkeyfacts/> 

Vaccination is most important in vulnerable populations, such as children or the elderly. The 2006-2007 season is the first in which the CDC has recommended that children younger than 59 months receive the annual flu vaccine.<ref name=cdcreport> [http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5510a1.htm Prevention and Control of Influenza: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)] CDC report (MMWR 2006 Jul 28;55(RR10):1-42) Accessed 19 Oct 06.</ref> Vaccines can cause the [[immune system]] to react as if the body were actually being infected, and general infection symptoms (many cold and flu symptoms are just general infection symptoms) can appear, though these symptoms are usually not as severe or long-lasting as influenza. The most dangerous side-effect is a severe [[allergy|allergic reaction]] to either the virus material itself, or residues from the hen eggs used to grow the influenza; however, these reactions are extremely rare.<ref> [http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/flushot.htm Questions & Answers: Flu Shot] CDC publication Updated Jul 24, 2006. Accessed 19 Oct 06.</ref>

[[Influenza pandemic#Personal health and hygiene|Good personal health and hygiene habits]] are reasonably effective in avoiding and minimizing influenza. Since influenza spreads through aerosols and contact with contaminated surfaces, it is important to persuade people to cover their mouths while sneezing and to wash their hands regularly.<ref name=cdcreport/>

== Treatment ==
{{further|[[Flu treatment]]}}

People with the flu are advised to get plenty of rest, drink a lot of liquids, avoid using [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[tobacco]] and, if necessary, take medications such as [[acetaminophen]] (paracetamol) to relieve the fever and muscle aches associated with the flu. Children and teenagers with flu symptoms (particularly fever) should avoid taking [[aspirin]] during an influenza infection (especially [[Influenzavirus B|influenza type B]]) because doing so can lead to [[Reye syndrome]], a rare but potentially fatal disease of the [[liver]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Glasgow J, Middleton B | title = Reye syndrome--insights on causation and prognosis. | url=http://adc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/85/5/351 | journal = Arch Dis Child | volume = 85 | issue = 5 | pages = 351-3 | year = 2001 | id = PMID 11668090}}</ref> Since influenza is caused by a virus, [[antibiotic]]s have no effect on the infection; unless prescribed for [[secondary infection]]s such as [[bacterial pneumonia]], they may lead to resistant bacteria. Antiviral medication is sometimes effective, but viruses can develop resistance to the standard antiviral drugs.

The two classes of anti-virals are neuraminidase inhibitors and M2 inhibitors (adamantanes). Neuraminidase inhibitors are currently prefered for flu virus infections.

Antiviral drugs such as [[oseltamivir]] (trade name Tamiflu) and [[zanamivir]] (trade name Relenza) are [[neuraminidase inhibitor]]s that are designed to halt the spread of the virus in the body.<ref name=Neuraminidase_inhibitors> {{cite journal | author = Moscona A | title = Neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza. | url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/353/13/1363 | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 353 | issue = 13 | pages = 1363-73 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 16192481}}</ref> These drugs are often effective against both influenza A and B.<ref name=Stephenson/>  The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] reviewed these drugs and concluded that they reduce symptoms and complications. <ref name="pmid16855962">{{cite journal | author = Jefferson T, Demicheli V, Di Pietrantonj C, Jones M, Rivetti D | title = Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in healthy adults. | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = CD001265 | year = | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001265.pub2 | id = PMID 16855962}}</ref> Resistance has not yet been a problem with neuraminidase inhibitors.

;M2 inhibitors (adamantanes)
The [[antiviral drug]]s [[amantadine]] and [[rimantadine]] are designed to block a viral [[ion channel]] and prevent the virus from infecting cells.

==Research==
[[Image:Influenza virus research.jpg|thumb|200px|right|CDC scientist working on influenza under high bio-safety conditions.]]
{{further|[[Flu research]]}}
Research on influenza includes studies on [[molecular virology]], how the virus produces disease ([[pathogenesis]]), host [[immune response]]s, [[genomics|viral genomics]], and how the virus spreads ([[epidemiology]]). These studies help in developing influenza countermeasures; for example, a better understanding of the body's immune response aids in [[vaccine]] development, and a detailed picture of how influenza invades cells aids in the development of antiviral drugs. One important basic research program is the [[Influenza Genome Sequencing Project]], which is creating a library of influenza sequences; this library should help to clarify which factors make one strain more lethal than another, which genes most affect [[immunogenicity]], and how the virus evolves over time.<ref> [http://msc.tigr.org/infl_a_virus/index.shtml Influenza A Virus Genome Project] at The Institute of Genomic Research. Accessed 19 Oct 06</ref>

Research into new vaccines is particularly important: as current vaccines are slow and expensive to produce and must be reformulated every year. The sequencing of the influenza genome and [[recombinant DNA]] technology may accelerate the generation of new vaccine strains by allowing scientists to substitute new antigens into a previously-developed vaccine strain.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Subbarao K, Katz J | title = Influenza vaccines generated by reverse genetics. | journal = Curr Top Microbiol Immunol | volume = 283 | issue = | pages = 313-42 | year = | id = PMID 15298174}}</ref> New technologies are also being developed to grow virus in [[cell culture]]; which promises higher yields, less cost, better quality and surge capacity.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bardiya N, Bae J | title = Influenza vaccines: recent advances in production technologies. | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/jdt26gc39v4bwk9q/ | journal = Appl Microbiol Biotechnol | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 299-305 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 15660212}}</ref> The US government has purchased from [[Sanofi Pasteur]] and [[Chiron Corporation]] several million doses of [[vaccine]] meant to be used in case of an [[influenza pandemic]] of [[H5N1]] avian influenza and is conducting clinical trials with these vaccines.<ref> [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/30/health/30vaccine.html?_r=1&oref=slogin New York Times article ""Doubt Cast on Stockpile of a Vaccine for Bird Flu""] by Denise Grady.

==Infection in other animals==
{{H5N1}}{{further|[[Influenzavirus A]], [[H5N1]] and [[Transmission and infection of H5N1]]}}
Influenza infects many animal species and transfer of viral strains between species can occur. [[Bird]]s are thought to be the main [[Host (biology)|animal reservoir]]s of influenza viruses.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gorman O, Bean W, Kawaoka Y, Webster R | title = Evolution of the nucleoprotein gene of influenza A virus. | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=2319644 | journal = J Virol | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | pages = 1487-97 | year = 1990 | id = PMID 2319644}}</ref> Sixteen forms of hemagglutinin and 9 forms of neuraminidase have been identified. All known subtypes (HxNy) are found in birds but many subtypes are endemic in humans, [[dog]]s, [[horse]]s, and [[pig]]s; populations of [[camel]]s, [[ferret]]s, [[cat]]s, [[pinniped|seal]]s, [[mink]], and [[whale]]s also show evidence of prior infection or exposure to influenza.<ref name=webster/> Variants of flu virus are sometimes named according to the species the strain is endemic in or adapted to. The main variants named using this convention are: [[Avian flu|Bird flu]], [[Human flu|Human Flu]], [[Swine flu|Swine Flu]], [[Horse flu|Horse Flu]] and [[Dog flu|Dog Flu]]. ([[Cat flu]] generally refers to [[Feline viral rhinotracheitis]] or [[Feline calicivirus]] and not infection from an influenza virus.) In pigs, horses and dogs influenza symptoms are similar to humans, with cough, fever and loss of appetite.<ref name=webster/> The frequency of animal diseases are not as well-studied as human infection, but an outbreak of influenza in harbour seals caused approximately 500 seal deaths off the New England coast in 1979-1980.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hinshaw V, Bean W, Webster R, Rehg J, Fiorelli P, Early G, Geraci J, St Aubin D | title = Are seals frequently infected with avian influenza viruses? | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=6471169 | journal = J Virol | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 863-5 | year = 1984 | id = PMID 6471169}}</ref> On the other hand, outbreaks in pigs are common and do not cause severe mortality.<ref name=webster/>

Flu symptoms in birds are variable and can be unspecific.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Elbers A, Koch G, Bouma A | title = Performance of clinical signs in poultry for the detection of outbreaks during the avian influenza A (H7N7) epidemic in The Netherlands in 2003. | journal = Avian Pathol | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 181-7 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 16191700}}</ref> The symptoms following infection with low-pathogenicity avian influenza may be as mild as ruf<U+FB02>ed feathers, a small reduction in egg production or weight loss combined with minor respiratory disease.<ref>Capua I, Mutinelli F. "Low pathogenicity (LPAI) and highly pathogenic (HPAI) avian in<U+FB02>uenza in turkeys and chicken." In: Capua I, Mutinelli F. (eds.), A Colour Atlas and Text on Avian In<U+FB02>uenza, Papi Editore, Bologna, 2001, pp. 13-20</ref> Since these mild symptoms can make diagnosis in the field difficult, tracking the spread of [[avian influenza]] requires laboratory testing of samples from infected birds. Some strains such as Asian [[H9N2]] are highly virulent to poultry, and may cause more extreme symptoms and significant mortality.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bano S, Naeem K, Malik S | title = Evaluation of pathogenic potential of avian influenza virus serotype H9N2 in chickens. | journal = Avian Dis | volume = 47 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 817-22 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 14575070}}</ref> In its most highly pathogenic form, influenza in chickens and turkeys produces a sudden appearance of severe symptoms and almost 100 % mortality within two days.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Swayne D, Suarez D | title = Highly pathogenic avian influenza. | journal = Rev Sci Tech | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 463-82 | year = 2000 | id = PMID 10935274}}</ref> As the virus spreads rapidly in the crowded conditions seen in the [[intensive farming]] of [[chicken]]s and [[turkey]]s, these outbreaks can cause large economic losses to poultry farmers.

An [[avian]]-adapted, highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 (called HPAI A(H5N1), for "highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of type A of subtype H5N1") causes [[transmission and infection of H5N1|H5N1 flu]], commonly known as "[[avian flu|avian influenza]]" or simply "[[bird flu]]", and is [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in many bird populations, especially in [[Southeast Asia]]. This Asian lineage strain of HPAI A(H5N1) is [[global spread of H5N1|spreading globally]]. It is [[epizootic]] (an epidemic in non-humans) and panzootic (a disease affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area) killing tens of millions of birds and spurring the [[culling]] of hundreds of millions of other birds in an attempt to control its spread. Most references in the media to "bird flu" and most references to H5N1 are about this specific strain.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Li K, Guan Y, Wang J, Smith G, Xu K, Duan L, Rahardjo A, Puthavathana P, Buranathai C, Nguyen T, Estoepangestie A, Chaisingh A, Auewarakul P, Long H, Hanh N, Webby R, Poon L, Chen H, Shortridge K, Yuen K, Webster R, Peiris J | title = Genesis of a highly pathogenic and potentially pandemic H5N1 influenza virus in eastern Asia. | journal = Nature | volume = 430 | issue = 6996 | pages = 209-13 | year = 2004 | id = PMID 15241415}}</ref><ref>Li KS, Guan Y, Wang J, Smith GJ, Xu KM, Duan L, Rahardjo AP, Puthavathana P, Buranathai C, Nguyen TD, Estoepangestie AT, Chaisingh A, Auewarakul P, Long HT, Hanh NT, Webby RJ, Poon LL, Chen H, Shortridge KF, Yuen KY, Webster RG, Peiris JS.

Workshop Summary] The National Academies Press (2005) "Today's Pandemic Threat: Genesis of a Highly Pathogenic and Potentially Pandemic H5N1 Influenza Virus in Eastern Asia", pages 116-130</ref>

At present, HPAI A(H5N1) is an avian disease and there is no evidence suggesting efficient human-to-human transmission of HPAI A(H5N1).  In almost all cases, those infected have had extensive physical contact with infected birds.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Liu J | title = Avian influenza--a pandemic waiting to happen? | url=http://jmii.org/content/pdf/v39n1p4.pdf | journal = J Microbiol Immunol Infect | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 4-10 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16440117}}</ref> In the future, H5N1 may  mutate or reassort into a strain capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. Due to its high lethality and [[virulence]], its [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] presence, its large and increasing biological [[host (biology)|host]] reservoir, the H5N1 virus is the world's pandemic threat in the 2006-7 flu season, and billions of dollars are being raised and spent researching H5N1 and preparing for a potential [[influenza pandemic]].<ref name=Rosenthal> Rosenthal, E. and Bradsher, K.

==Economic impact==
{{further|[[Social impact of H5N1]]}}
Influenza produces [[variable cost|direct cost]]s due to lost productivity and associated medical treatment, as well as [[indirect costs]] of preventative measures. In the United States influenza is responsible for a total cost of over $10 billion per year, while it has been estimated that a future pandemic could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in direct and indirect costs.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/pandemic-influenza.html Statement from President George W. Bush on Influenza] Accessed 26 Oct 2006</ref> However, the economic impact of past pandemics have not been intensively studied and some authors have suggested that the Spanish influenza actually had a positive long-term effect on per-capita income growth, despite a large reduction in the working population and severe short-term depressive effects.<ref>Brainerd, E. and M. Siegler (2003), <U+201C>The Economic Effects of the 1918 Influenza Epidemic<U+201D>, ''CEPR Discussion Paper'', no. 3791.</ref> Other studies have attempted to predict the costs of a pandemic as serious as the 1918 Spanish flu on the U.S. economy, where 30 percent of all workers became ill, and 2.5 percent were killed. A 30 percent sickness rate and a three-week length of illness would decrease [[gross domestic product]] by 5 percent. Additional costs would come from medical treatment of 18 million to 45 million people, and total economic costs would be approximately $700 billion.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Poland G | title = Vaccines against avian influenza--a race against time. | url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/13/1411 | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 354 | issue = 13 | pages = 1411-3 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16571885}}</ref>

Preventative costs are also high. Governments worldwide have spent billions of U.S. dollars preparing and planning for a potential H5N1 avian influenza pandemic: with costs associated with purchasing drugs and vaccines as well as developing disaster drills and strategies for improved border controls.<ref name=Rosenthal/> On [[November 1]] [[2005]] President George Bush unveiled the National Strategy To Safeguard Against The Danger of Pandemic Influenza<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/pandemic-influenza.html National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza] Whitehouse.gov Accessed 26 Oct 2006.</ref> backed by a request to Congress for 7.1 billion U.S. dollars to begin implementing the plan.<ref>[http://usinfo.state.gov/gi/Archive/2005/Nov/01-432345.html Bush Outlines $7 Billion Pandemic Flu Preparedness Plan] State.gov. Accessed 26 Oct 2006</ref> Internationally, on [[January 18]] [[2006]] donor nations pledged two billion U.S. dollars to combat bird flu at the two day International Pledging Conference on Avian and Human Influenza held in China.<ref>[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jan2006/2006-01-18-02.asp Donor Nations Pledge $1.85 Billion to Combat Bird Flu] Newswire Accessed 26 Oct 2006.</ref> 

Up to 2006, over ten billion dollars have been spent and over two hundred million birds have been killed to try to contain H5N1 avian influenza.<ref>[http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/acvfa/intro_ai.pdf Avian Influenza and its Global Implications] US AID. Accessed 26 Oct 2006.</ref> However, as these efforts have been largely ineffective at controlling the spread of the virus, other approaches are being tried: for example, the [[Vietnam]]ese government in [[2005]] adopted a combination of mass poultry vaccination, disinfecting, culling, information campaigns and bans on live poultry in cities.<ref> [http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&storyID=2006-04-28T080147Z_01_HAN5054_RTRUKOC_0_UK-BIRDFLU-VIETNAM.xml Reuters Vietnam to unveil advanced plan to fight bird flu] published on April 28, 2006. Accessed 26 Oct 2006</ref> As a result of such measures, the cost of poultry farming has increased, while the cost to consumers has gone down due to demand for poultry falling below supply. This has resulted in devastating losses for many farmers. Poor poultry farmers can not afford mandated measures keeping their bird livestock from contact with wild birds (and other measures) thus risking losing their livelihood altogether. Multinational poultry farming is increasingly becoming unprofitable as H5N1 avian influenza becomes endemic in wild birds worldwide.<ref>[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=52471 Poultry sector suffers despite absence of bird flu] UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Accessed 26 Oct 2006</ref> Financial ruin for poor poultry farmers, that can be as severe as threatening starvation, has caused some to commit suicide and many others to stop cooperating with efforts to deal with this virus; further increasing the human toll, the spread of the disease and the chances of a pandemic mutation.<ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/BOM269913.htm Nine poultry farmers commit suicide in flu-hit India] Reuters.
