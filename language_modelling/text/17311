'''Li Jiawei''' ({{zh|c=<U+674E><U+4F73><U+8587>|p=L<U+01D0> Ji<U+0101>w<U+0113>i}}; born 9 August 1981) is a [[People's Republic of China|China]] born [[Singapore]]an [[table tennis]] player who is ranked among the top ten athletes in her sport. Spotted by Singapore [[scout (sport)|talent scouts]] in [[Beijing]] in 1995, she moved to Singapore and commenced her international career in competitive table tennis in 1996. She became a [[Singaporean nationality law|Singapore citizen]] at the age of 18 years under the [[Foreign Sports Talent Scheme]].

As a singles player, Li was ranked sixth in the world as of August 2008. Her highest ranking was in December 2005, when she was third. Li is also a key player for women's team and doubles, and mixed doubles events. She finished in fourth place in singles at both the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]] and the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]]. On 15 August, the Singapore women's team composed of Li and her teammates [[Feng Tianwei]] and [[Wang Yuegu]] defeated [[South Korea]] 3<U+2013>2 in the semifinals. However in the finals on 17 August, the team lost to China and obtained a [[silver medal]], marking the first time that Singapore had won an Olympic medal since the nation's independence in 1965. The medal came 48&nbsp;years after [[Tan Howe Liang]] won the country's first medal, a silver in weightlifting at the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rome]]. Li ended 2008 on a high, winning gold in the women's team event with Feng and Wang at the ITTF Pro Tour ERKE German Open in Berlin in November, and in the doubles with Sun Beibei at the ITTF Volkswagen Pro Tour Grand Finals in Macau in December 2008.

==Personal life==
Li first met Singaporean badminton player and fellow Olympian [[Ronald Susilo]] in 2002 at a sports meet.<ref name="ST 20061022"/> They began dating after participating together in the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens Olympics]], and the "golden sports couple",<ref name=AsiaOne>{{citation|title=Golden couple Susilo and Li Jiawei break up|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Sports/Story/A1Story20080116-45299.html|publisher=AsiaOne|date=16 January 2008|accessdate=18 August 2008}}.</ref> as they were dubbed by the media, announced their engagement in September 2004. About two years later there were rumours that they were breaking up, but these were denied by them at the time.<ref name="ST 20061022"/> On 15 January 2008, when queried by a journalist, Susilo confirmed that he and Li had broken up amicably the previous week.<ref name=AsiaOne/> Following a report in ''[[The Straits Times|The Sunday Times]]'' that Susilo was contemplating legal action against her to recover money he claimed to have spent in buying their condominium apartment and car, Li disagreed that Susilo had a share in the apartment and implied he was trying to affect her mood and thus her chances of winning a medal at the Beijing Olympics. Susilo declined to discuss the matter with the press, saying it was a private matter between Li and himself; he wished her all the best for the Olympics.<ref>{{citation|author=Terrence Voon|title=Li Jiawei speaks out against ex-fiance|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Story/A1Story20080409-58989.html|newspaper=The Straits Times (reproduced on AsiaOne)|date=9 April 2008}}.
