'''Michael (Mick) Fitzpatrick''' ([[1933]]<U+2013>[[8 October]] [[1968]]) was an [[Irish Republicanism|Irish republican]] and [[List of IRA Chiefs of Staff|chief of staff]] of the [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA). 

Born in [[Wexford]] in [[1893]] he was one of the 'driving forces' behind the anti-[[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] IRA in [[Dublin]] during the [[Irish Civil War]]. He was briefly the [[officer commanding]] of the IRA's [[Dublin]] Brigade and was [[interned]] in [[1923]]. During this period he was also involved with the first [[Communist Party of Ireland]]. 

Fitzpatrick was a full-time official of the Grocers' [[trade union]] and secretary of its social club at the Banba Hall in Dublin<U+2019>s [[Parnell Square]]. He also managed the Balalaika Ballroom and restaurant in the same area. 

He was the key figure in IRA contacts with the [[Soviet Union]] during the late 1920s. In 1927 he attended the first International Congress of the [[Friends of Soviet Russia]] (FOSR) in [[Moscow]]. In 1928 he helped establish an Irish section of the FOSR. During 1929 he was involved in launching the [[Irish Labour Defence League]] and the [[Workers' Revolutionary Party (Ireland)]]. He was also involved in [[Comhairle na Poblachta]], a body set up the same year to heal the rift between the military and political anti-Treaty forces in Ireland. He visited the Soviet Union again in [[1932]]. 

Fitzpatrick chaired the [[1933]] [[IRA General Army Convention]] (GAC). At the 1934 GAC he disagreed with the call for a [[Republican Congress]] and remained within the IRA. His union was involved in a strike with O'Mara's Bacon Shops in late 1934 in which the IRA intervened violently. During 1935 he was involved in the IRA's intervention in the Dublin transport strike. 

In 1936 he was an unsuccessful candidate for [[Cumann Poblachta na h<U+00C9>ireann]], a political party set up by the IRA. Fitzpatrick succeeded [[Tom Barry]] as [[List of IRA Chiefs of Staff|chief of staff]] in 1937, only to be ousted by [[Se<U+00E1>n Russell]] at the 1938 GAC. 

He was involved in the launch of [[Clann na Poblachta]] in [[1946]] and a member of its national executive. At the 1948 Irish general election, he was elected as a [[Teachta D<U+00E1>la|TD]] for [[Dublin North West (D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann constituency)|Dublin North West]] for the party, winning 2,395 votes (10.33 percent of the vote).[http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=1948&cons=99] At the following general election in 1951, he received a meagre 458 votes (1.93 percent share) and lost his seat.[http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=1951&cons=99]
