'''Sir George Elliot, 1st Baronet''', [[Justice of the Peace|JP]] (18 March 1814 &ndash; 23 December 1893) was a self-made [[businessman]] from [[Gateshead]] in the North-East of [[England]]. A [[colliery]] labourer who went on to own several [[coal mine]]s, he later bought a [[wire rope]] manufacturing company which manufactured the first [[Transatlantic telegraph cable]]. He was also a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP).

==Early life==
Elliot was born in [[Gateshead]], the eldest son of Ralph Elliot, a coal miner. He started work at the age of 9 as a trapper boy at Whitefield Pit, [[Penshaw]], and eventually owned this colliery later in his life.

==Business developents==
In 1840 Elliot entered into a partnership and purchased Washington Colliery. In 1849, he purchased Kuper & Co, wire rope and telegraph cable manufacturer and formed a partnership with [[Richard Atwood Glass]]. Elliot purchased Whitefield Colliery, where he had worked as a boy in 1864 and in 1866 Elliot & Glass's Telegraph Construction & Maintenance Company laid the first Atlantic cable. In 1868 he was president of the North of England Institute of Mining Engineers.

==Political career==
At the 1868 general election, Elliot was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[North Durham (UK Parliament constituency)|North Durham]].<ref>{{Rayment-hc|d|2|date=March 2012}}</ref>  In 1873, with William Hunter of Sandhoe, he opened Kimblesworth Colliery. He lost his seat at Durham at the 1874 general election but regained it later in the year. He was created a [[Elliot Baronets|baronet]] on 15 May 1874 in recognition of his work for public services. He advised [[Benjamin Disraeli]] to invest in the [[Suez Canal]], which privided a faster shipping route to India. He was a financial advisor to the Egyptian Khedive (the viceroy under the Ottomans), and also received an honour from the King of Portugal <U+2013> the grand cross of the military order of Our Lady of Villa Viciosa. As an MP made arrangements for the new tongue of [[Big Ben]], in [[Westminster]], [[London]], to be forged at Hopper<U+2019>s Iron Foundry in [[Houghton-le-Spring]].

In 1874/5 he was president of Durham University Society and in 1876 he was Provincial Grand Master of the [[Freemasons]]. In 1877 Elliot donated the 130 foot tall tower and spire of St Mary<U+2019>s Church, West Rainton, in memory of his daughter, Elizabeth, and in 1878 he erected a stone tomb in the churchyard of All Saints<U+2019> Church, Penshaw to his father, mother and brothers and also to his son Ralph Elliot who had died in 1873 aged 35 at the Cape of Good Hope.

In 1880 Elliot lost his seat at North Durham but regained it in a by-election in 1881. In 1882 he purchased land in [[Aberamman]] as a gift in memory of his wife and daughter Elizabeth. Work commenced on the construction of St Margaret<U+2019>s Church and it was completed in 1883. In 1883 Elliot was president of the Association of Mining Engineers. In 1885 the North Durham constituency was reorganised under the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]] and at the 1886 general election Elliot was elected MP for [[Monmouth Boroughs (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouth Boroughs]]. He held the seat until 1892.<ref>{{Rayment-hc|m|3|date=March 2012}}</ref>

Elliot established the Elliot Home for Seamen, in Temple Street, Newport, Monmouthshire in 1886, and in 1889 donated the stained glass window of the Baptism, Resurrection and Ascension to All Saint<U+2019>s Church, Penshaw, in memory of his brothers and son. Elliot was visited at his residene at the Royal Crescent in [[Whitby]] by [[Bram Stoker]]. Elliot owned an Egyptian princess mummy and which may have inspired Stoker to write the ''Jewel of the Seven Stars'', a horror novel, in 1903.

Elliot worked on a plan to amalgamate the all the coalfields of Great Britain. He proposed that, to improve the working conditions of the miners, a proportion of the coal industry profits should be paid into a fund for retired miners.

Elliot died at the age of 79 and was buried at Houghton Hillside Cemetery on 28 December 1893.

==Family==
Elliot married Margaret Green of Shiney Row in 1836. Their son [[Sir George Elliot, 2nd Baronet|George]] was MP for Northallerton and Richmond and succeeded to the baronetcy.
