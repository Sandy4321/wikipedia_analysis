'''State Route 180''' runs for about 26 miles from [[State Route 60 (Georgia)|S.R. 60]] in [[Suches, Georgia|Suches]] to S.R. [[State Route 17 (Georgia)|17]]/[[State Route 75 (Georgia)|75]] halfway between [[Hiawassee, Georgia|Hiawassee]] and [[Helen, Georgia|Helen]] in [[Union County, Georgia|Union County]].  S.R. 180 traverses some of the most difficult terrain in Georgia, traveling the gaps of the highest mountains in the state.  The route has two sections known as Bald Mountain Road and Wolfpen Gap Road, which are joined by a 2.3 mile overlap with [[U.S. 19]]/[[U.S. 129|129]] in the north of [[Vogel State Park]].  Much of the highway is in the [[Chattahoochee National Forest]].

Bald Mountain Road, named for the state's highest peak ([[Brasstown Bald]]), is the eastern section of the highway and has been designated a [[National Scenic Byway]] and a [[Georgia Scenic Byway]].  Included in this section is a junction with the [[Richard B. Russell Scenic Highway]] and part of S.R. 180 is included in the [[Russell-Brasstown Scenic Byway]].  Bald Mountain Road crosses the [[Nottely River]] shortly before the overlap with U.S. 19/129.

Wolfpen Gap Road (11.8-mile western section of the highway) is known to be the curviest road in the state.  Sites along this section include various hiking trails and scenery as well as Vogel State Park, access to [[Sosebee Cove]], an intersection with the [[Coosa Back Country Trail]], [[Lake Winfield Scott]] (Georgia's highest lake) and [[Suches, Georgia|Suches]], <U+201C>The Valley Above The Clouds.<U+201D>  The highpoint of the highway is 3,260 feet at Wolfpen Gap.
