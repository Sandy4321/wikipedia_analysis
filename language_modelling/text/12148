'''W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Hugo Dionizy Steinhaus''' {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|h|j|u<U+02D0>|<U+0261>|o<U+028A>|_|<U+02C8>|s|t|a<U+026A>|n|<U+02CC>|h|a<U+028A>|s}} (January 14, 1887 <U+2013> February 25, 1972) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[mathematician]] and [[teacher|educator]]. Steinhaus obtained his PhD under [[David Hilbert]] at [[G<U+00F6>ttingen University]] in 1911 and later became a professor at the [[Lviv University#Jan Kazimierz University (1919<U+2013>39)|Jan Kazimierz University]] in [[Lw<U+00F3>w]] (now [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]), where he helped establish what later became known as the [[Lw<U+00F3>w School of Mathematics]]. He is credited with "discovering" mathematician [[Stefan Banach]], with whom he gave a notable contribution to [[functional analysis]] through the [[Banach<U+2013>Steinhaus theorem]]. After [[World War II]] Steinhaus played an important part in the establishment of the mathematics department at [[Wroc<U+0142>aw University]] and in the revival of Polish mathematics from the destruction of the war.

Author of around 170 scientific articles and books, Steinhaus has left its legacy and contribution on many branches of mathematics, such as functional analysis, [[geometry]], [[mathematical logic]], and [[trigonometry]]. Notably he is regarded as one of the early founders of the [[game theory]] and the [[probability theory]] preceding in his studies, later, more comprehensive approaches, by other scholars.

==Early life and studies==
Steinhaus was born on January 14, 1887 in [[Jas<U+0142>o]],<ref name="100y"/> [[Austria-Hungary]] to a family with Jewish roots. His father, Bogus<U+0142>aw, was a local industrialist, owner of a brick factory and a merchant. His mother was Ewelina, n<U+00E9>e Lipschitz. Hugo's uncle, Ignacy Steinhaus, was an activist in the ''Ko<U+0142>o Polskie'' (Polish Circle), and a deputy to the [[Diet of Galicia|Galician Diet]], the regional [[Legislative Assembly|assembly]] of the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]].<ref name="jaslo"/>

Hugo finished his studies at the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Jas<U+0142>o in 1905. His family wanted him to become an [[engineer]] but he was drawn to [[pure mathematics|abstract mathematics]] and began to study the works of famous contemporary mathematicians on his own. In the same year he began studying philosophy and mathematics at the [[Lviv University#Under Austrian rule|University of Lemberg]].<ref name=jaslo/> In 1906 he transferred to [[University of G<U+00F6>ttingen|G<U+00F6>ttingen University]].<ref name=100y/> At that University he received his Ph.D. in 1911, having written his doctoral dissertation under the supervision of [[David Hilbert]]. The title of his thesis was ''Neue Anwendungen des Dirichlet'schen Prinzips'' ("New applications to [[Dirichlet's principle]]").<ref name="kac"/>

At the start of [[World War I]] Steinhaus returned to Poland and served in [[J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski]]'s [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legion]], after which he lived in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]].<ref name="mac"/>

==Academic career==

===Interwar Poland===
During the 1916-1917 period and before Poland had regained its full [[Polish Independence Day|independence]], which occurred in 1918, Steinhaus worked in Krak<U+00F3>w for the [[Ministry of Interior and Administration of the Republic of Poland|Ministry of the Interior]] in the ephemeral puppet state of [[Kingdom of Poland (1916<U+2013>1918)|Kingdom of Poland]].<ref name=uniw/>

In 1917 he started to work at the [[Lviv University#Under Austrian rule|University of Lemberg]] (later ''[[Lviv University#Jan Kazimierz University (1919<U+2013>39)|Jan Kazimierz University]]'' in [[Poland]]) and acquired his [[habilitation]] qualification in 1920.<ref name=uniw/> In 1921 he became a ''profesor nadzwyczajny'' ([[associate professor]]) and in 1925 ''profesor zwyczajny'' (full professor) at the same university.<ref name=uniw/> During this time he taught a course on the then cutting edge theory of [[Lebesgue integration]], one of the first such courses offered outside of [[France]].<ref name=kac/>

While in Lw<U+00F3>w, Steinhaus co-founded the [[Lw<U+00F3>w School of Mathematics]]<ref name=wroc/> and was active in the circle of mathematicians associated with the [[Scottish Caf<U+00E9>|Scottish cafe]], although, according to [[Stanislaw Ulam]], for the circle's gatherings, Steinhaus would have generally preferred a more upscale tea shop down the street.<ref name=mac/>

===World War II===
[[File:KsiegaSzkocka1.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The [[Scottish Book]] from the [[Lw<U+00F3>w School of Mathematics]], which Steinhaus contributed to and probably saved during World War II.]]
In September 1939 after [[Invasion of Poland|Nazi Germany]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet Union]] both invaded and occupied Poland, as a fulfillment of the [[Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop Pact]] they had signed earlier, Lw<U+00F3>w initially came under Soviet occupation. Steinhaus considered escaping to [[Hungary]] but ultimately decided to remain in Lw<U+00F3>w. The Soviets reorganized the university to give it a more [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] character, but they did appoint [[Stefan Banach]] (Steinhaus's student) as the dean of the mathematics department and Steinhaus resumed teaching there. The faculty of the department at the school were also strengthened by several Polish refugees from German occupied Poland. According to Steinhaus, during the experience of this period, he "acquired a insurmountable physical disgust in regard to all sorts of Soviet administrators, politicians and commissars"{{Cref2|A}}

During the interwar period and the time of the Soviet occupation, Steinhaus contributed ten problems to the famous ''[[Scottish Book]]'', including the [[Banach's matchbox problem|last one]], recorded shortly before Lw<U+00F3>w was captured by the Nazis in 1941, during [[Operation Barbarossa]].<ref name=mac/>

Steinhaus, because of his Jewish background, spent the [[Nazi occupation of Poland|Nazi occupation]] in hiding, first among friends in Lw<U+00F3>w, then in the small towns of [[Osiczyna]], near [[Zamo<U+015B><U+0107>]] and [[Berdech<U+00F3>w]], near Krak<U+00F3>w.<ref name="wroc"/><ref name="kac2"/> The [[Polish anti-Nazi resistance]] provided him with false documents of a forest ranger who had died sometime earlier, by the name of Grzegorz Krochmalny. Under this name he taught clandestine classes (higher education was [[Education in Poland during World War II|forbidden for Poles under the German occupation]]). Worried about the possibility of imminent death if captured by Germans, Steinhaus, without access to any scholarly material, reconstructed from memory and recorded all the mathematics he knew, in addition to writing other voluminous memoirs, of which only a little part has been published.<ref name=kac2/>

Also while in hiding, and cut off from reliable news on the course of the war, Steinhaus devised a statistical means of estimating for himself the German casualties at the front based on sporadic obituaries published in the local press. The method relied on the relative frequency with which the obituaries stated that the soldier who died was someone's son, someone's "second son", someone's "third son" and so on.<ref name=kac2/>

According to his student and biographer, [[Marek Kac]], Steinhaus told him that the happiest day of his life were the twenty four hours between the time that the Germans left occupied Poland and the Soviets had not yet arrived ("They had left, and they had not yet come").<ref name=kac2/>

===After World War II===
[[File:Steinhaus-tablica.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Commemorative plaque, [[Wroc<U+0142>aw]], Poland]]
In the last days of World War II Steinhaus, still in hiding, heard a rumor that University of Lw<U+00F3>w was to be transferred to the city of [[Breslau]] ([[Wroc<U+0142>aw]]), which Poland was to acquire as a result of the [[Potsdam agreement]] (Lw<U+00F3>w became part of Soviet Ukraine). Although initially he had doubts, he turned down offers for faculty positions in [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]] and [[Lublin]] and made his way to the city where he began teaching at [[University of Wroc<U+0142>aw#The University of Wroc<U+0142>aw|University of Wroc<U+0142>aw]].<ref name=wroc/> While there, he revived the idea behind the ''Scottish Book'' from Lw<U+00F3>w, where prominent and aspiring mathematicians would write down problems of interest along with prizes to be awarded for their solution, by starting the ''[[New Scottish Book]]''. It was also most likely Steinhaus who preserved the original ''Scottish Book'' from Lw<U+00F3>w throughout the war and subsequently sent it to Stanis<U+0142>aw Ulam, who translated it into English.<ref name=mac/>

With Steinhaus' help, Wroc<U+0142>aw University became renowned for mathematics, much as the University of Lw<U+00F3>w had been.<ref name=kac2/>

Later, in the 1960s, Steinhaus served as a visiting professor at the [[University of Notre Dame]] (1961<U+2013>62)<ref name=mac/> and the [[University of Sussex]] (1966).<ref name="wprost"/>

==Mathematical contributions==
{{See also|Banach<U+2013>Steinhaus theorem}}

Steinhaus authored over 170 works.<ref name=mac/> Unlike his student, Stefan Banach, who tended to specialize narrowly in the field of [[functional analysis]], Steinhaus made contributions to a wide range of mathematical sub-disciplines, including [[geometry]], [[probability theory]], functional analysis, theory of [[Trigonometric series|trigonometric]] and [[Fourier series]] as well as [[mathematical logic]].<ref name=kac/><ref name=mac/> He also wrote in the area of [[applied mathematics]] and enthusiastically collaborated with [[engineers]], [[geologists]], [[economists]], [[physicians]], [[biologists]] and, in Kac's words, "even [[lawyers]]".<ref name=kac2/>

Probably his most notable contribution to [[functional analysis]] was the 1927 proof of the [[Banach<U+2013>Steinhaus theorem]], given along with Stefan Banach, which is now one of the fundamental tools in this branch of mathematics.

His interest in [[game]]s led him to propose an early formal definition of a [[Strategy (game theory)|strategy]], anticipating [[John von Neumann]]'s more complete treatment of a few years later. Consequently he is considered an early founder of modern [[game theory]].<ref name=uniw/> As a result of his work on infinite games Steinhaus, together with another of his students, [[Jan Mycielski]], proposed the [[Axiom of determinacy]].<ref name=kac2/>

Steinhaus was also an early contributor to, and co-founder of, probability theory, which at the time was in its infancy and not even considered an actual part of mathematics.<ref name=kac2/> He provided the first [[axiom (disambiguation)|axiom]]atic [[measure theory|measure-theoretic]] description of [[coin toss|coin-tossing]], which was to influence the full axiomatization of probability by the Russian mathematician [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] a decade later.<ref name=kac2/> Steinhaus was also the first to offer precise definitions of what it means for two events to be "[[Independence (probability theory)|independent]]", as well as for what it means for a [[random variable]] to be "[[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]]".<ref name=mac/>

While in hiding during World War II Steinhaus worked on the "[[cake-cutting problem]]":  how to divide a resource in a manner which is "fair" according to precisely defined criteria, such as [[Proportional (fair division)|proportionality]] and [[envy-free]].{{Cref2|B}}

Steinhaus was also the first person to conjecture the [[ham-sandwich theorem]],<ref name=kac2/><ref name= beyer/> and one of the first to propose the method of [[k-means clustering]].<ref name=cluster/>

==Legacy==
[[File:Hugo Steinhaus honoris causa UAM.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Honorary doctorate]] bestowed on Steinhaus by [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna<U+0144>|Pozna<U+0144> University]]]]

Steinhaus is said to have "discovered" the Polish mathematician Stefan Banach in 1916, after he overheard someone utter the words "[[Lebesgue integral]]" while in a Krak<U+00F3>w park (Steinhaus referred to Banach as his "greatest mathematical discovery").<ref name="Alfred Tarski: life and logic"/> Together with Banach and the other participant of the park discussion, [[Otto Nikodym]], Steinhaus started the ''Mathematical Society of Krak<U+00F3>w'', which later evolved into the [[Polish Mathematical Society]].<ref name=mac/> He was a member of ''PAU'' (the [[Polish Academy of Learning]]) and ''PAN'' (the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]), ''PTM'' (the [[Polish Mathematical Society]]), the ''Wroc<U+0142>awskie Towarzystwo Naukowe'' ([[Wroc<U+0142>aw Scientific Society]]) as well as many international scientific societies and science academies.<ref name=uniw/>

Steinhaus also published one of the first articles in ''[[Fundamenta Mathematicae]]'', in 1921.<ref name="One Hundred Volumes of ''Fundementa Mathematicae''"/> He also co-founded ''[[Studia Mathematica]]'' along with [[Stefan Banach]] (1929),<ref name=wroc/> and  ''Zastosowania matematyki'' (Applications of Mathematics, 1953), ''Colloquium Mathematicum'', and ''Monografie Matematyczne'' (Mathematical Monographs).<ref name="100y"/>

He received [[Honorary doctorate#Honorary doctorates|honorary doctorate degrees]] from [[Warsaw University]] (1958), [[Wroc<U+0142>aw Medical Academy]] (1961), [[Pozna<U+0144> University]] (1963) and Wroc<U+0142>aw University (1965).<ref name=wroc2/>

Steinhaus had full command of several foreign languages and was interestingly, known, for his [[aphorism]]s, to the point that a booklet of his most famous ones in [[Polish language|Polish]], [[French language|French]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] has been published posthumously.<ref name=kac2/>

In 2002, the Polish Academy of Sciences and Wroc<U+0142>aw University sponsored "2002, The Year of Hugo Steinhaus", to celebrate his contributions to Polish and world science.<ref name=rok/>

Notable mathematician [[Mark Kac]], Steinhaus's student, wrote:

{{quote|"He was one of the architects of the school of mathematics which flowered miraculously in Poland between the two wars and it was he who, perhaps more than any other individual, helped to raise Polish mathematics from the ashes to which it had been reduced by the second World War to the position of new strength and respect which it now occupies. He was a man of great culture and in the best sense of the word a product of Western civilization."<ref name=kac/>}}
