David Alexander Mulholland was born in [[Portadown]], [[County Armagh]], Northern Ireland and was brought up a [[Protestant]]. He lived in the town's Killycomain estate and made his living as a butcher. He also served as a part-time member of the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] (UDR).<ref name="Tiernan108">Tiernan, Joe (2000).

This brigade was founded in 1972 by UDR captain and Staff Instructor [[Billy Hanna]], who had appointed himself its commander.<ref name="tiernanind">[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/sunningdale-pushed-hardliners-into-fatal-outrages-in-1974-519004.html "Sunningdale pushed hardliners into fatal outrages in 1974".

===The attacks===

According to the sworn affidavit made by [[Special Patrol Group (RUC)|Special Patrol Group]] officer [[John Weir (loyalist)|John Weir]] in 1999, the Dublin car bombings which took place in the city centre on Friday 17 May 1974 during evening rush hour were organised by Billy Hanna, who led two UVF bombing teams, one from Belfast, the other from his own Mid-Ulster Brigade.<ref name="red">[http://www.seeingred.com/Copy/2.1_CODE_weiraff.html "Seeing Red", John Weir's Affidavit, John Weir's Statement. 01.03.99]</ref><ref name="barron145">[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/dublin/barron03.pdf The Barron Report (2003). pp.145-146]</ref> The bombings were carried out on the third day of the [[Ulster Workers' Council Strike]] which was a general strike in Northern Ireland called by hardline loyalists and [[Ulster unionism|Unionists]] in protest against the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] and the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] that had proposed their sharing political power with Catholic [[Irish nationalism|Nationalists]] and planned a greater role for the Republic of Ireland in the governance of Northern Ireland. 

The bombs were collected from a [[Glenanne gang|Glenanne, County Armagh farm]] where they had been constructed and stored. Weir alleged that the farm, owned by [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) reservist [[Glenanne gang|James Mitchell]], was used as a UVF arms dump and bomb-making site.<ref name="barron144">[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/dublin/barron03.pdf The Barron Report (2003). p.144-145]</ref> Journalist Joe Tiernan then suggested that the bombs were placed onto a poultry lorry belonging to senior Mid-Ulster UVF member [[Robin Jackson]], who drove it across the border into the Republic of Ireland and down to a carpark in the northern suburbs of Dublin. He was accompanied by Hanna.<ref name="tiernanind"/> The two men met up with the rest of the bomb team and the vehicles which were to be used in the attacks. After the bombs had been activated by Hanna, he and Jackson loaded the devices into the boots of the three designated cars that had been hijacked and stolen that morning in Belfast by a UVF gang known as "Freddie and the Dreamers", led by [[William Marchant (loyalist)|William "Frenchie" Marchant]]. Mulholland was ordered by Hanna to drive a metallic green 1970 model [[Hillman Avenger]] registration number DIA 4063 into [[Parnell Street]], located on the [[Northside (Dublin)|northside]] of Dublin's city centre.<ref name="Tiernan108">Tiernan. pp.108-109</ref> The Avenger, along with the second of the three bomb cars, was preceded by a lead "scout" car. Hanna and Jackson meanwhile headed back to Northern Ireland in the latter's poultry lorry.

Upon reaching the city centre, Mulholland, according to one eyewitness, drove up the wrong way of a one-way street (Cathedral Street), thereby attracting attention.<ref name="barron58">[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/dublin/barron03.pdf The Barron Report (2003).p.58]</ref> He then drove back down the same street and turned left into Marlborough Street where he proceeded towards Parnell Street.<ref name="barron61"/>  At about 17.12 he arrived at a parking bay in Parnell Street which was occupied by a married couple, Mortimer and Teresa O'Loughlin, who were just leaving. The latter had got a good, clear look at him.<ref name="barron53">[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/dublin/barron03.pdf The Barron Report (2003).pp.53,61]</ref> As soon as they pulled out, Mulholland moved into their space and parked the car bomb. This was close to the southwestern intersection with Marlborough Street, facing the direction of [[O'Connell Street]], Dublin's main thoroughfare. The green Avenger, hijacked that morning in Belfast, had reached its final destination in the parking bay outside the "Welcome Inn" pub and "Barry's Supermarket", with a butcher's shop and a petrol station, the "Westbrook Motors Company", nearby. Mulholland then got out of the car and walked away. 

At 17.28 the 100 pound bomb exploded and the Avenger came apart in a ball of flame. The blast blew out shop fronts, caused considerable damage to vehicles and buildings in the vicinity, and hurtled bodies, body parts, pieces of the car, glass and shrapnel in all directions. The blast also created a six-by-three feet crater in the street.<ref name="barron1">[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/dublin/barron03.pdf The Barron Report (2003). pp.1, 67]</ref> Ten people were killed, including a young inner-city Dublin couple, John and Anne O'Brien, and their two infant daughters. An elderly man had his leg and half his head blown away. Many others were seriously injured, among them a teenaged petrol-pump attendant and a four year-old boy, who suffered severe facial injuries. His father was one of the dead.<ref name="barron4">[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/dublin/barron03.pdf The Barron Report (2003). p.4]</ref> The force of the explosion had catapulted a brown [[Mini]] which had been parked behind the Avenger onto the pavement outside the "Welcome Inn" at a right angle. Two minutes later a second car bomb, a blue mink [[Ford Escort]] (whose driver remains unidentified), exploded in [[Talbot Street]], killing another 14 people, mostly young women. One of the victims, Colette Doherty, was nine months pregnant. The third bomb, planted inside a blue Austin 1800 Maxi, went off in South Leinster Street at 17.32 and two more women were killed outright. No warnings had been given and the bombs were so well constructed that 100% of each bomb exploded upon detonation. The bombers escaped from central Dublin in the scout cars and crossed the Northern Ireland border at Hackballscross, [[County Louth]] at about 19.30. Thirty minutes earlier a fourth bomb had exploded in [[Monaghan]]. This had been delivered by a team from the Portadown unit of the Mid-Ulster UVF inside a stolen [[Hillman Minx]]. A further seven people were killed in this final attack.

==Aftermath==
In the 2003 Barron Report which was the findings of an official investigation into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings commissioned by Irish Supreme Court Justice, [[Henry Barron]], it stated that Mulholland was identified as the driver of the Parnell Street car bomb by three separate eyewitnesses.<ref name="barron61">[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/dublin/barron03.pdf The Barron Report (2003). p.61]</ref> They picked him out from police file photographs during the investigation carried out by the [[Garda S<U+00ED>och<U+00E1>na]] following the attacks. A Garda report described him as follows:<blockquote>"David Alexander Mulholland, of 113 Ulsterville Park, Portadown. This man is a member of the UVF and has a history of involvement in car bomb explosions in Northern Ireland. He is 35 years of age, 6 feet in height, well built, blue eyes, light brown hair, turning grey, large round features, very pale complexion".<ref name="barron61"/></blockquote> Teresa O'Loughlin picked out three different photographs of him from two albums, maintaining that he was the driver of the green car that had taken their car's parking space in Parnell Street at 17.12. A second witness claimed to have seen Mulholland driving the Avenger at Sheephouse, County Louth at about 13.00. Journalist Joe Tiernan alleged that Mulholland was collected  in Portadown by the hijacker of the Avenger and he then drove the car down to Dublin.<ref name="tiernan97">Tiernan, Joe (2010). ''The Dublin and Monaghan Bombings''. Eaton publications. p.97</ref> The third eyewitness, Nora O'Mahoney, picked out two separate photos of Mulholland and alleged that she had spoken to him at about 16.20 in [[D'Olier Street]] having asked him directions, which he had given to her before getting inside a green car with the registration letters DIA. She later saw him driving the same green car onto O'Connell Street from North Earl Street against the direction of traffic. She additionally suggested that he had spoken with an English accent rather than Northern Irish which confused the police.<ref name="barron61"/>

The RUC arrested and questioned Mulholland for two days; a Garda detective was present during the interviews. Although, Mulholland admitted to knowing the other leading suspects, he denied involvement in the attacks. It was revealed in an RUC report that he was an occasional visitor to the Irish Republic, mainly to the border towns of [[Castleblaney]], [[Dundalk]] and Monaghan. He was released from custody without being charged.<ref name="barron86">The Barron Report (2003): p.86</ref> The Gardai never interrogated him about the bombings.

Tiernan alleged that sometime after the bombings, Mulholland was approached by an RUC detective who was acting on behalf of the Gardai. When the detective  threatened him with extradition to the Republic of Ireland due to the overwhelming evidence against him, Mulholland named Hanna as the leader of the UVF bombing team. Hanna was on the list of suspects for the Dublin bombings of both the Garda and the RUC, however he was never arrested or interrogated in connection with the attacks. The two men were subsequently offered immunity from prosecution on the condition that they both become informers and reveal the identities of their accomplices. They accepted the deal, although none of the UVF bomb unit were ever charged.<ref name="Tiernan108">Tiernan, pp.108-111</ref> The [[British Army]] was aware of this arrangement; Hanna allegedly had links to [[Military Intelligence]].<ref name="Tiernan89">Tiernan, pp.89-90</ref> On 27 July 1975 Hanna was shot dead outside his home in [[Lurgan]]. His purported assassin, Robin Jackson, assumed command of the Mid-Ulster UVF.<ref name="Tiernan110">Tiernan. pp.110-111</ref> Immediately after Hanna's killing, Mulholland and his family fled to [[Chester]], England.

In 1993, Yorkshire Television aired a documentary ''The Hidden Hand: The Forgotten Massacre'' about the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. Mulholland was questioned after the broadcast regarding his alleged central role in the Parnell Street blast; he staunchly denied involvement. No one was ever charged with the bombings which, with a final death toll of 33 people, resulted in the most casualties in any single day in the history of [[The Troubles]]. When British journalist [[Peter Taylor (journalist)|Peter Taylor]] asked former UVF member and [[Progressive Unionist Party]] (PUP) politician [[David Ervine]] the motive behind the attacks, Ervine replied that the UVF were "returning the serve". Although Ervine had nothing to do with the bombings, he explained to Taylor that the UVF had wanted Catholics in the Republic to suffer as the Protestants in Northern Ireland had on account of the intense bombing campaign waged by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]].<ref name="taylor">Taylor, Peter (1999).

==Death==
Mulholland died of kidney failure in Chester on Wednesday 10 December 2003 at the age of 65. His death came hours after the publication of the Barron Report which named him as a prime suspect in the 1974 Dublin bombings.<ref name="moriarty">[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-24710858.html "Dublin bombings suspect was senior figure in UVF".
