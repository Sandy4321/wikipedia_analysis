The '''''Heidi'' Game''' or '''''Heidi'' Bowl''' was an [[American football]] game played on November 17, 1968. The home team, the [[Oakland Raiders]], defeated the [[New York Jets]], 43<U+2013>32. The game is remembered for its exciting finish, as Oakland scored two [[touchdowns]] in the final minute to overcome a 32<U+2013>29 New York lead. The ''Heidi'' Game obtained its name because the [[National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC) controversially broke away from the game with the Jets still winning to air the [[television film]] ''[[Heidi (1968 film)|Heidi]]'' at 7&nbsp;p.m. in the [[Eastern Time Zone]].

In the late 1960s, few professional football games took longer than two and a half hours to play, and the Jets<U+2013>Raiders three-hour time slot was thought to be adequate. A high-scoring contest, together with a number of injuries and penalties for the two bitter [[American Football League]] rivals caused the game to run long. NBC executives had ordered that ''Heidi'' must begin on time, but given the exciting game, they decided to postpone the start of the film and continue football coverage. As 7&nbsp;p.m. approached, many members of the public called NBC to inquire about the schedule, to complain or opine, jamming NBC's switchboards, and the change could not be communicated. ''Heidi'' began as scheduled, preempting the final moments of the game and the two Oakland touchdowns in the eastern half of the country, to the outrage of viewers.

The ''Heidi'' Game led to a change in the way professional football is televised on network television; games are shown to their conclusion before evening programming begins. To ensure that network personnel could communicate under similar circumstances, special telephones (dubbed "''Heidi'' phones") were installed, with a connection to a different [[telephone exchange]] than other network phones. In 1997, the ''Heidi'' Game was voted the most memorable regular season game in pro football history.

The Jets' loss to the Raiders in 1967 knocked New York out of a tie for first place in their division<ref>{{cite news|title=Not like '67: Jets Winging|work=The Oakland Tribune|author=Valli, Bob|date=November 16, 1967|pages=13<U+2013>18}}</ref><U+2014>the AFL East was won by the [[Houston Oilers]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Oilers plan no change in offense|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QSgjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bWwDAAAAIBAJ&dq=houston%20oilers&pg=6956%2C5058377|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|author=Associated Press|date=December 30, 1967|accessdate=September 18, 2011}}</ref>

In the [[1968 AFL season|1968 season]], the Jets, [[San Diego Chargers]], Raiders, and [[Kansas City Chiefs]] established themselves as the leading teams. Going into Week 11 of the AFL season, each team had lost only two games; the Chiefs, who had not yet had a [[Bye (sports)|bye week]], had eight wins, the others seven. In an era with no [[Wild_card_(sports)#National_Football_League|wild card]] teams, the Raiders needed a victory over the Jets in Week 11 to avoid falling a game and a half behind the Chiefs in the AFL West<U+2014>finishing second, however good their record, would end their season. The Jets, on the other hand, would clinch at least a tie for the AFL East title with a victory over the Raiders in their only regular season meeting. Depending on the results of other games, the Jets could win the division if they beat the Raiders, gaining a berth in the AFL Championship Game, the winner of which would play the [[NFL]] champion in the [[Super Bowl]].<ref name="d316">Davis, p. 316.</ref> The ill-feeling of previous years was resurrected by an immense blown-up photograph of Davidson smashing Namath in the head posted in Raider headquarters. The photographed play was said to have broken the quarterback's jaw (though Namath stated he had broken it on a tough piece of steak, and some claim it was Raiders [[defensive end]] [[Ike Lassiter]] who injured Namath). Although the poster, which had been placed by Davis, was removed before the game, word of this "intimidation through photography" reached the Jets in New York.<ref name="topforty">Strother, pp. 90<U+2013>93.</ref><ref name="dave">{{cite news|title=Sports of The Times; In A.F.L.

In 2000, ''The New York Times'' sportswriter [[Dave Anderson (sportswriter)|Dave Anderson]] wrote of the Jets' preparations for the Oakland game:

<blockquote>When the Jets went to Oakland in 1968, that photo on the Raiders' wall symbolized the rivalry as well as Coach Weeb Ewbank's distrust of Davis. Whenever a helicopter flew anywhere near a Jets practice the week before a game against the Raiders, Ewbank would look up and shake his fist. He just knew Davis had somebody spying on the Jets.<ref name="dave"/></blockquote>

The Raiders declined to allow New York reporters to watch practices, a courtesy Ewbank extended to Oakland pressmen. Raiders assistant coach (later head coach) [[John Madden]] was responsible for the exchange of game films with upcoming opponents; he sent the films to the Jets through [[Chicago]] so they would arrive a day or two late, reasoning that Davis, not him, would be blamed for the delay. Ewbank blamed Davis for heavily watering the Coliseum field to slow the Jets' speedy receivers, a tactic the Oakland owner credited to Madden.<ref name="dave"/>

===Television===
NBC's preparations for the Sunday, November 17 game at Oakland were routine. This was a nationwide telecast, to be shown to the entire country at 4&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]. NBC hoped that viewers who tuned their television channel selectors to the game would not walk over to the television and change the channel or turn off the power switch, but would watch the evening's programming. They anticipated a good game, which would cause the audience to remain in their seats and watch the game in full, "a perfect lead in for the network's special presentation of ''Heidi'', the [[Johanna Spyri]] children's classic, which was scheduled to air after the game at 7&nbsp;p.m. (EST)".<ref name="topforty"/> The [[television film]] was preempting ''[[Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]'', the normal program shown by NBC Sundays at 7.<ref>Hanks, p. 68.</ref> As the game started at 1&nbsp;p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Standard Time]], the western half of the country would have to wait after the game for 7&nbsp;p.m. local time before seeing ''Heidi''.<ref name="think">Garlett, pp. 175<U+2013>178.</ref> Under television rules at the time, the Jets<U+2013>Raiders game was [[Blackout (broadcasting)|blacked out]] within 90 miles of Oakland, even though the game was a sellout.<ref>Travers, p. 114.</ref>

''[[Heidi (1968 film)|Heidi]]'' was heavily promoted by NBC in television commercials and newspaper advertisements. The network hoped to gain a large audience, especially among families, whom the network anticipated would watch the entire two-hour film. Commercials for the film were not sold by NBC, instead the entire block of two hours was sold to the [[Timex Group USA|Timex]] watch company which would air the film<!--If you call it a movie, that will be changed by our international people to film, so go with the flow.--> and have its own commercials run.<ref>Davis, pp. 315<U+2013>316, 318.</ref> ''The New York Times'' touted ''Heidi'' as the best TV program of the day.<ref name="sport">{{cite news|title=Great Games: Jets vs. Raiders, 1968|work=[[SPORT (magazine)|Sport]]|publisher=Macfadden Publications|pages=22<U+2013>23|author=Schuster, Joe|date=March 1993}}</ref> Under the terms of the contract between Timex and NBC, ''Heidi'' had to go to air promptly at 7 p.m. Eastern (6 p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central]]), and could not be delayed or joined in progress for any reason.<ref name=BRewound>{{cite web|title=The ''"Heidi"'' game in Birmingham|url=http://www.birminghamrewound.com/features/heidi.htm|publisher=Birmingham Rewound|date=October 25, 2008|accessdate=January 17, 2009}}</ref>

Steven Travers, in his history of the Raiders, noted:

<blockquote>That Sunday evening at 7:00&nbsp;pm the family classic ''Heidi'' was scheduled. This is the well-known story of a little Swiss girl who lives with her grandfather in the [Alps], a staple of wholesome entertainment. In the days before cable, pay-per-view, VHS, DVD, TiVo, record, rewind, and 700 channels<U+2014>what the choices came down to what NBC, ABC, CBS, and maybe a handful of local stations wanted to show the public, TV viewers scheduled their days around events like ''Heidi''. It was on once a year. If one missed it, they missed it until the next year.<ref>Travers, p. 115.</ref></blockquote>

The nerve center for NBC was known as Broadcast Operations Control (BOC). Dick Cline, the network BOC supervisor for sports telecasts, prepared the series of network orders which would result in the game running as scheduled, followed by ''Heidi''. Cline had no reason to believe that the game would run over three hours; no professional football game presented by NBC ever had. However, other NBC executives stressed that ''Heidi'' must start as scheduled. NBC President [[Julian Goodman]] told his executives before the weekend that the well-sponsored, well-promoted film must start on time. [[NBC Sports]] Executive Producer Don "Scotty" Connal took care to tell the game producer, Don Ellis, that ''Heidi'' must start at 7 in the East, over Ellis' objection that he had been trained never to leave a game in progress. Connal told Ellis that NBC had sold the time, and was obligated to switch to the film.<ref>Davis, pp. 317<U+2013>318.</ref>

NBC ran three BOCs, in [[Burbank, California]], Chicago, and New York, with the last the largest. Cline was stationed at the New York BOC for the game. In the era before [[satellite transmission]], programming was transmitted by coaxial cable line, with the cooperation of the telephone company. For this game, the Burbank BOC was to receive the feed from Oakland, insert commercials and network announcements, and send the modified feed via telephone wire to a switching station west of Chicago near the [[Mississippi River]]. An engineer was stationed there to activate the Oakland feed into the full network when the game began, to cut it on instruction and then to return to his base. He had been told to expect at 6:58:20 EST<!--The time, of course, was an hour earlier for him, as he was in the Central Time Zone, a fact not worth mentioning. These things are routine in television.--> a network announcement for ''Heidi'', after which he was to cut the feed from Burbank, and the ''Heidi'' feed from New York would begin. This placed Burbank in effective control of whether the engineer would cut the feed, since he would act upon hearing the announcement.<ref>Davis, pp. 315<U+2013>316.</ref>

Connal, Cline's boss, was available in case of trouble, watching from his home in [[Connecticut]]. His superior, NBC Sports Vice President [[Chet Simmons]], who alternated weekends with Connal as on-call in the event of difficulties, was also watching from his [[Manhattan]] home. NBC President Goodman and NBC Sports head Carl Lindemann also turned on the game, which was expected to be exciting, in their [[New York area]] homes.<ref>Davis, pp. 317, 319.</ref> The [[Buffalo Bills]] versus San Diego Chargers game, shown as the first of a [[Doubleheader (television)|doubleheader]], was running long in its 2<U+00BD> hour time slot, and NBC unhesitatingly cut its ending to go to the Jets and Raiders.<ref name="great">Clary, pp. 131<U+2013>133.</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Hot and cold streaks on the line|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B16F63D54157493C4A8178AD95F4C8685F9&scp=10&sq=chargers+bills&st=p|work=The New York Times|date=November 16, 1968|accessdate=September 5, 2011}} Fee for article.</ref>

==Game events==
===Football action===
[[File:Namath 1965.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Namath in 1965.]]
On the opening kickoff, the Jets were penalized for a [[personal foul (football)|personal foul]] against the Raiders. The Jets took an early 6<U+2013>0 lead on 44-yard and 18-yard [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|field goals]] made by [[Placekicker|kicker]] [[Jim Turner (placekicker)|Jim Turner]]. The Raiders, led by [[quarterback]] [[Daryle Lamonica]], who had been battling recent back and knee injuries, scored the game's first [[touchdown]], taking a 7<U+2013>6 lead on a 22-yard pass to receiver [[Warren Wells]] towards the end of the first quarter. The Raiders added to their lead when Lamonica threw a 48-yard pass to [[tight end]] [[Billy Cannon]] at the beginning of the second quarter.<ref name="topforty"/><ref name="drive">"Oakland Raiders v. New York Jets" (official typewritten statistical sheets). American Football League, November 17, 1968. On file with the Pro Football Hall of Fame and Museum, Canton OH, "''Heidi'' Game" file.</ref>

However, the Jets cut into Oakland's lead when Namath drove the offense 73 yards down field and ran the ball in for a 1-yard touchdown with five seconds remaining in the first half. Jets holder and backup quarterback [[Babe Parilli]] tried to complete a [[two-point conversion]] pass, but it fell incomplete and the Raiders led the Jets 14<U+2013>12 at halftime.<ref name="topforty"/><ref name="drive"/><ref>Sahadi, p. 182.</ref><!--Accounts differ as to whether or not it was a bad snap or a premeditated fake kick.-->

Approximately five minutes into the third quarter, Namath forged another Jets drive, following an [[interception]] by safety [[Jim Hudson]], that ended with halfback [[Bill Mathis]] scoring a 4-yard touchdown behind blocking guard [[Dave Herman]] to give New York a 19<U+2013>14 lead. The Raiders responded with an 80-yard drive that saw running back [[Charlie Smith (running back)|Charlie Smith]] score his first touchdown of the game on a 3-yard pass from Lamonica. The Raiders took a 22<U+2013>19 lead on a two-point conversion with Lamonica completing the attempt to receiver [[Hewritt Dixon]].<ref name="topforty"/><ref name="drive"/> During this drive, Hudson was ejected from the game after being called for a face mask penalty followed by a dispute with an official. As he left the field, he gave the jeering crowd [[Finger (gesture)|the finger]]. The penalties caused the ball to be placed at the Jets' 3-yard line, and Smith scored for Oakland one play later.<ref name="topforty"/>  

The fourth quarter began with Smith fumbling the football with Oakland in scoring position. New York defensive end [[Gerry Philbin]] recovered the football at the Jets' 3-yard line setting up a 97-yard drive, consisting entirely of two Namath passes to [[Don Maynard]], who was covered by Raiders' rookie cornerback [[George Atkinson (American football)|George Atkinson]]. The 50-yard touchdown pass followed a 47-yard throw, and gave the Jets a 26<U+2013>22 lead. Turner added another field goal to the Jets' total, giving them a 29<U+2013>22 lead. The Raiders promptly responded with Lamonica orchestrating an 88-yard drive that ended with a 22-yard pass to receiver [[Fred Biletnikoff]] with less than four minutes remaining in the game, tying the contest.<ref name="topforty"/><ref name="drive"/>

{{Quote box|quoted=true|bgcolor=#FDF0F0|salign=right|quote=I would have outrun Hudson, too. The play that was called back was a circle pattern, but teams were getting wise to that.

Our wide receivers ran deep patterns to clear out the secondary and then I just cut underneath.|source=Raiders running back [[Charlie Smith (running back)|Charlie Smith]]<ref>LaMarre, p. 59.</ref>|align=right|width=33%}}
Turner made a 26-yard field goal to break the tie and give the Jets a three point lead with a little over a minute remaining in the game. Turner kicked the ball off to the Raiders' Smith, who took the kick out of the end zone and to Oakland's own 22-yard line. Lamonica completed to Smith for an apparent touchdown, but the play was called back due to a penalty, causing New York cornerback [[Johnny Sample]] to say to Lamonica, "Nice try, Lamonica. Better luck next year."<ref>LaMarre, p. 58.</ref> On first down, Smith caught a 20-yard reception from Lamonica, while a 15-yard penalty was assessed against the Jets when a player grabbed Smith's facemask, moving the ball to the Jets' 43-yard line. On the ensuing play, Lamonica threw another pass to Smith who outpaced Jets safety [[Mike D'Amato (American football)|Mike D'Amato]], who replaced the ejected Jim Hudson, for a 43-yard touchdown. Kicker [[George Blanda]] made the extra point attempt which gave the Raiders a 36<U+2013>32 lead.<ref name="topforty"/><ref name="drive"/>

With 42 seconds remaining, the Jets still had a chance to score; however, on the kickoff, New York [[Kickoff returner|return man]] [[Earl Christy]] fumbled the ball at the Jets' 12-yard line when he was tackled by Raiders linebacker [[Bill Budness]]. Reserve running back [[Preston Ridlehuber]] picked up the fumbled ball and ran into the end zone, which with another Blanda extra point gave the Raiders a 43<U+2013>32 lead, deflating any hopes of the Jets coming back to win the contest. Ridlehuber could not remember whether AFL rules permitted advancing a fumbled kickoff return (they did), so tried to make it appear he was entering the end zone with the same motion he gathered in the ball. Oakland kicked off to New York again, but it could do little with the ball in the final seconds, and the game ended.<ref name="topforty"/><ref name="drive"/>

===Television and decisions===
The two starting quarterbacks combined for 71 pass attempts, with the clock stopping on each incompletion, and the officials called 19&nbsp;penalties, leading to more clock stoppages.<ref name="sport"/> Each team used all six of its allocated timeouts, and the many scores led to additional commercial breaks.<ref name="noway">Davis, pp. 318<U+2013>319.</ref> At halftime, Connal called Cline, and without urgency discussed the fact that the game seemed to be running longer than expected.<ref name="d317">Davis, p. 317.</ref>

As the fourth quarter began, it was 6:20 EST,<ref name = "drive"/><!--Official statistical sheets say the 4th quarter took 47 minutes to play, and we know the game ended at 7:07.--> and NBC executives began to realize the game might not end by seven. NBC Sports Vice President [[Chet Simmons]] recalled:

<blockquote>They kept promoting ''Heidi'', kept promoting ''Heidi''. I kept looking at my watch, and I said to myself, there's no way to me that ''Heidi'''s going to make this at seven o'clock. Julian Goodman, the president of the company, told us going into the weekend that ''Heidi'' had to start on time&nbsp;...I looked at my watch, looked at another table clock, looked at the game, and thought, no way is this going to happen.<ref name="noway"/></blockquote>

Connal, watching the game from his home in [[Old Greenwich, Connecticut]], also noticed the fourth quarter was running "terribly slow."<ref name=BRewound/> At 6:45, he called Cline again, and both men agreed the game would not end on time. Both supported running the end of the game, but given Goodman's instructions, his permission was required. Connal agreed to call NBC Sports President Lindemann, and that he and Lindemann would then speak to Goodman. After promising Cline a return call, Connal reached Lindemann by telephone. Lindemann agreed that the end of the game should be run, and both men began trying to reach Goodman. Lindemann was successful in reaching Goodman, and asked the network president, "What about the instruction to broadcast operations control that ''Heidi'' had to go on at 7:00 ET, no matter what?"<ref name="r87">Rappoport, p. 87.</ref> Goodman replied, "That's crazy. It's a terrible idea."<ref name="r87"/> Lindemann then set up a three-way conversation with himself, Goodman and NBC Television President Don Durgin. After several minutes of discussion, Durgin agreed to delay the start of ''Heidi'' until after the game was completed.<ref name=BRewound/> Sportswriter Kyle Garlett, in his history of sports gaffes, noted, "And even though earlier executives had told [Cline] to make sure he started ''Heidi'' on time, those same executives changed their minds late in the game."<ref name="think"/>

Cline, watching the clock nervously, attempted to call Connal back, only to find both lines busy. He waited as long as he could, then made one final, unsuccessful attempt. Unknown to Cline, Connal was talking to Goodman, who had agreed to "slide the network", that is, start ''Heidi'' as soon as Curt Gowdy signed off from the game. Connal called the game producer, Ellis, in Oakland, to tell him the news, then called the BOC supervisor in Burbank<U+2014>who, not knowing Connal, refused his order, and insisted on speaking with Goodman directly. As Goodman had disconnected to allow Connal to call Oakland, this could not be done.<ref name="refuse">Davis, pp. 321<U+2013>325.</ref>  

Beginning about 6:45, many members of the public began calling NBC network and affiliate switchboards. Some demanded the conclusion of the game, others wanted to know if ''Heidi'' would start on time. These calls jammed the switchboards, and even blew repeated fuses in them, preventing the executives from getting through to each other to resolve the situation. NBC protocol required an operations order from Connal, to countermand the midweek written orders, but Cline received no call from the increasingly desperate Connal, who was frustrated by the switchboard issues. Without such an order, and not knowing of Goodman's approval, Cline made the decision that ''Heidi'' would start on time.<ref name=Davis321>Davis, pp. 321<U+2013>323.</ref>  The television audience saw Smith return Turner's kickoff out of the end zone to the Oakland 22-yard line with 1:01 remaining. Burbank BOC played the closing football theme and gave the word cue, to the outraged shock of Ellis and Connal, and the connection was irretrievably broken. Although the western United States continued to view the game, the eastern half of the nation, including those expecting the finish of the football game saw instead a little girl on a Swiss mountain, and was unaware that Oakland was in the course of scoring two touchdowns to win the game.<ref name=Davis321/>

''[[Oakland Tribune]]'' reporter Bob Valli reported on the ''Heidi'' Game: "Television missed one of football's most exciting and exhausting minutes of emotion. In that minute, Oakland fans saw despair turn to delirium."<ref name="turn"/>

On realizing that NBC was switching away from the game, Goodman said to Lindemann by phone, "Where the hell has our football game gone?"<ref>Rappoport, p. 89.</ref> During the [[station break]] which began with the network announcement, Goodman called a BOC phone to which only he knew the number and which was not part of NBC's CIrcle-7<!--It is not an error that both the C and the I are capitalized, that is how telephone exchanges were designated, for example PEnnsylvania-6, or FLanders-1 --> exchange (which blew a fuse 26 times in an hour). When Cline answered it, Goodman ordered him to go back to the game. Although Cline knew there was no way to reconnect the feed, he promised to do the best he could.<ref>Davis, pp. 323<U+2013>324.</ref> By the time the game ended at 7:07, thousands of viewers were calling the network to complain about missing the end of the football game. Others called newspapers, television stations, even the [[New York City Police Department]], both to seek the final score, and simply to vent.<ref name="great"/> In Oakland, Gowdy and his broadcast partner, [[Al DeRogatis]], left the broadcast booth to tell Ellis that the final two minutes were the most exciting they had ever seen. Ellis replied, "It's too bad America didn't see it."<ref name="eagle">{{cite news|title=''Heidi'' game still memorable|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NfkhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=86IFAAAAIBAJ&dq=heidi%20game&pg=5358%2C2261458|pages=10, 13|work=Reading Eagle|date=November 19, 1988|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}</ref> Realizing that the original call had been lost, Ellis had the two sportscasters recreate their descriptions of the two Raider touchdowns on tape.<ref name="eagle"/>

In an attempt to inform the audience of the outcome of the game, NBC flashed the final score across the screen. It did so just as Heidi's paralyzed cousin, Klara, was taking her first, slow steps. According to sportswriter Jack Clary, "The football fans were indignant when they saw what they had missed. The ''Heidi'' audience was peeved at having an ambulatory football score intrude on one of the story's more touching moments. Short of pre-empting ''Heidi'' for a skin flick, NBC could not have alienated more viewers that evening."<ref name="great"/>

At 8:30, Goodman issued a statement apologizing for the incident, and stating that he had missed the ending of the game "as much as anybody".<ref name="great"/> He stated that it was "a forgivable error committed by humans who were concerned about children expecting to see ''Heidi''".<ref name="great"/> The following morning, Cline was called into a meeting with his bosses. He was told that if he had done anything other than what he did, NBC would have been at the mercy of Timex and Cline would have been fired.<ref name="d325">Davis, p. 325.</ref> The network turned the fiasco into an advantage by subsequent self-mockery, promoting the following week's Jets game telecast with an advertisement showing Namath with Heidi on his shoulders, and running another ad with testimonials about ''Heidi'', the last: "I didn't get to see it but I hear it was very good", signed by Namath.<ref name="d325"/> Other networks joined in: On Monday night's ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', [[Harry Reasoner]] announced the "result" of the game: "Heidi married the goat-herder".<ref name="think"/>

A special "''Heidi'' phone", a hotline connected to a different exchange and unaffected by switchboard meltdowns, was installed in BOC.<ref name="eagle"/> The network quickly changed its procedures to allow games to finish before other programming begins,<ref name="great"/> which is now standard practice.<ref name="eagle"/> Three weeks after the ''Heidi'' Game, NBC aired a special presentation of ''[[Pinocchio (1968 film)|Pinocchio]]''. In the promotional newspaper advertisement for the film, [[Pinocchio]] assured football fans that they would view the entire game before the film and that he would sooner cut off his nose than "have them cut off" the action.<ref name="h70">Hanks, p. 70. "The ad read: 'Pinocchio says, I'd rather cut off my nose than have them cut off any of today's AFL action.'"</ref> On December 15, the nationally televised game between the Raiders and Chargers ran over. NBC started ''[[The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' at 7:08 EST, and announced that all network programming would be eight minutes late. "I can't remember when we've done anything like this before," stated an NBC executive.<ref name = "un"/> "It's very unusual."<ref name="un">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F2RSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xHsDAAAAIBAJ&dq=huckleberry%20finn%20heidi&pg=4025%2C4732766|title=Huck Finn, etc., yield to grid|date=December 16, 1968|work=St. Petersburg Times|pages=1<U+2013>C|author=Associated Press|accessdate=September 18, 2011}}</ref>

In subsequent television contracts, the [[AFL<U+2013>NFL merger|merged NFL]] required language which obligated the networks to show games to completion in the road team's television market.<ref>LaMarre, p. 61.</ref> In 1975, NBC planned to run the heavily promoted children's film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' at 7&nbsp;p.m., right after a game between the Raiders and [[Washington Redskins]]. The game went into overtime, but NBC stayed with the game for almost 45&nbsp;minutes despite angry calls from parents.<ref name="great"/>

Cline stated in 1989, "I wonder if this ''Heidi'' thing will ever die&nbsp;...maybe now that it's past 20 years people will stop asking me about it."<ref name="h70"/> The ''Heidi'' Game, in 1997, was voted among the ten most memorable games in pro football history, and the most memorable regular season contest.<ref>Travers, p. 118.</ref> In 2005, ''[[TV Guide]]'' designated the ''Heidi'' Game as the sixth (of one-hundred) most unexpected TV moments. Interviewed by the magazine, [[Jennifer Edwards]], title star of ''Heidi'', commented: "My gravestone is gonna say, 'She was a great moment in sports.'&nbsp;"<ref>{{cite news|title=100 most unexpected TV moments|work=TV Guide|page=15|author=Edelstein, Robert|date=December 5, 2005}}</ref>

Cline summed up the events of the ''Heidi'' Game:

<blockquote>Everything had to be perfect. It was just a series of events that fit together. The game ran late, there was a lot of scoring; there were some injuries that stopped play. And if the Jets had won, there would not have been the to-do that was made. But the way they lost fanned the fires."<ref name="eagle"/></blockquote>

===Football events===
The Jets were enraged by the outcome of the game, for reasons having nothing to do with the television problems, of which they were initially unaware. Feeling that Hudson's disqualification was unjustified (his replacement, D'Amato, was beaten for the winning touchdown), assistant coach [[Walt Michaels]] chased after the officials, and he and team doctor [[James Nicholas]] banged on the door of their dressing room, complaining bitterly. Ewbank mentioned the officiating in his postgame press conference.<ref name="topforty"/> When told of Michaels' actions, the head coach ordered, "Get him out of there, it can only cost him money."<ref name="sullen">{{cite news|title=Sullen Jets want Raiders in rematch|work=The Oakland Tribune|author=Ross, George|date=November 18, 1968|pages=33, 39}}</ref> Oakland coach Rauch told reporters, "There were so many turning points which kept putting both teams back in the game, it's impossible to discuss them all."<ref name="turn">{{cite news|title=That clutch Raiders win|work=The Oakland Tribune|author=Valli, Bob|date=November 18, 1968|pages=33, 39}}</ref>

Ewbank learned of the television problems in the locker room when he received a telephone call from his wife congratulating him on a Jets victory<U+2014>Lucy Ewbank assumed the fact that the end of the game was not shown meant New York had won. Her husband profanely informed her of the game result.<ref>Davis, p. 324.</ref> She was not the only Jets relative deceived<U+2014>cornerback Johnny Sample flew back east after the game on personal business, and when his father picked him up at [[Philadelphia International Airport]], he congratulated his son on a Jets triumph.<ref>Hanks, pp. 67<U+2013>68.</ref>

Michaels accused Al Davis of getting the officials to inspect Turner's kicking shoes before a field goal attempt to see if they contained illegal metal plates, and called the Oakland owner "a man who has never contributed anything to football", to which Davis responded, "It's utterly ridiculous, unbelievable. It seems the Jets always lose to us because of penalties. But I like them and don't want any feud in case we visit New York December 29 [if both teams qualify for the AFL Championship Game]".<ref name="usher1">{{cite news|title=Bitter Oakland taste still choking Michaels|work=Newsday|author=Usher, George|date=November 19, 1968}}</ref> The Jets left their white road uniforms in Oakland to be laundered and sent to them in San Diego, where they were to play their next game. The uniforms were not seen again once the team removed them in the Oakland locker room, and Jets management hastily ordered the green home uniforms, as well as the white uniforms the team had worn in the preseason to be shipped from New York.<ref>{{cite news|title=Oakland jinx hits Jets: Even uniforms are lost|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A17F6395E1A7B93C1AB178AD95F4C8685F9&scp=9&sq=jets+chargers&st=p|work=The New York Times|date=November 23, 1968|accessdate=August 20, 2011}} Fee for article.</ref>

While in California, Michaels complained by phone to [[Mel Hein]], AFL supervisor of officials, stating that an official had cursed at  Hudson, provoking a response which led to Hudson's ejection.<ref name= "usher1"/>  Jets officials also showed excerpts from [[NFL Films|the game films]] to the sportswriters from the New York papers who were assigned to cover the team. Zimmerman, who wrote for the ''[[New York Post]]'', later stated, "I never saw such ferocity on a football field in my life" and remembered that the films showed Oakland defensive lineman [[Dan Birdwell]] punch Namath in the groin, causing him to remain on the ground for several minutes, though he did not have to leave the game. Birdwell's action was not penalized by the game officials.<ref name="h71"/> In early December, football Commissioner Pete Rozelle fined the Jets $2,000, Michaels $150, Hudson $200 (including a mandatory $50 fine for being ejected from the game), and Jets player [[John Elliott (defensive lineman)|John Elliott]], also disqualified, $50.<ref name="usher1"/><ref name="usher2">{{cite news|title=Jets' letter provokes 2,000 guesses|work=Newsday|author=Usher, George|date=December 4, 1968}}</ref> Rozelle cited the Jets' screening of the game excerpts as a factor contributing to the team's fine.<ref name="h71">Hanks, p. 71.</ref> To avoid adverse fan reaction, the AFL reassigned [[field judge]] Frank Kirkland, whom Hudson had accused of using foul language, from the December 1 Jets game against the [[Miami Dolphins]] at Shea Stadium, to another game.<ref name="fox">{{cite news|title=Rozelle fines Jets $2,000|work=New York Daily News|author=Fox, Larry|date=December 3, 1968}}</ref>

The Jets defeated San Diego, 37<U+2013>15, and clinched the AFL East four days later when the second-place Oilers lost to the Chiefs in a Thanksgiving Day game.<ref>Sahadi, p. 184.</ref> The Raiders finished tied for the AFL West title with Kansas City; they then defeated the Chiefs in a tiebreaking playoff game. This set up a December 29 rematch between the Jets and Raiders in the AFL Championship.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raiders recall ''Heidi'' win when last they met Jets|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=z7ZWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZOkDAAAAIBAJ&dq=raiders%20chiefs%20heidi%20playoff&pg=5551%2C2714799|work=The Spokesman-Review|page=15|author=Associated Press|date=December 25, 1968|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}</ref>

The Jets hosted the Raiders at [[Shea Stadium]] on a windy December afternoon to determine who would play in [[Super Bowl III]] against the NFL champions, who proved to be the [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]].<ref>Namath, p. 179.</ref> The Jets defeated the Raiders, 27<U+2013>23.<ref>LaMarre, pp. 55<U+2013>57.</ref> Two weeks later, the Jets defeated the Colts in the Super Bowl. According to sportswriter Doyle Dietz, in the Jets' upset victory (the Colts were [[spread betting|favored by]] as many as 19<U+00BD> points), "the American Football League came of age".<ref>{{cite news|title=Baker recalls Jets' flight into history|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RZUtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2qAFAAAAIBAJ&dq=heidi%20game&pg=5171%2C4848163|page=65|work=Reading Eagle|author=Deitz, Doyle|date=January 20, 1980|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}</ref>  Madden later stated that the Jets' Super Bowl upset "was great for the history of the game, but a part of me has always felt that should have been [the Raiders] who were the first AFL team to do it ... [Super Bowl III] changed pro football. But I will always believe we would have beaten the Colts, too."<ref>LaMarre, pp. 52<U+2013>53.</ref>

In 1988, Namath and Madden, by then both television analysts, were interviewed for the 20th anniversary of the ''Heidi'' Game. According to Madden, the Oakland victory in the ''Heidi'' Game "was kind of the start of the Raiders being a great team. One of the things we were doing was getting these fantastic come-from-behind things&nbsp;...We didn't even know about the ''Heidi'' thing until we read about it the next day."<ref name="usa">{{cite news|title=Twenty years later, NBC's ''Heidi'' game remembered|work=USA Today|author=Shuster, Rachel|date=November 17, 1988}}</ref> Namath noted, "When I remember that game, it brings to mind the revenge factor we had against them going into the championship game. We paid them back then," to which Madden chuckled, "He's full of crap."<ref name="usa"/>
