'''"Strawberry Fields Forever"''' is the title of a [[1967]] song recorded by [[The Beatles]]. Widely considered to be one of the group's best recordings, it is also one of the defining works of the [[psychedelic rock]] genre. Although conventionally credited to both [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] (see [[Lennon-McCartney]]), "Strawberry Fields Forever" is known to have been composed solely by Lennon.

== Release ==
The single was first released on [[February 13]], [[1967]], in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and on [[February 17]], [[1967]] in the [[United States]], as one side of a [[double A-side]] single, teamed with the McCartney composition "[[Penny Lane]]". The Beatles had originally planned to release "Strawberry Fields Forever" backed with "[[When I'm Sixty-Four]]". When manager [[Brian Epstein]] asked producer [[George Martin]] about the sessions for the single, Martin told Epstein the group had recorded what were, in his opinion, their two finest songs ("Strawberry Fields Forever" and "Penny Lane"). Epstein suggested that Martin issue the songs as a double A-sided single, as they had done with their previous single "Yellow Submarine/Eleanor Rigby".

The single reached #2 in the UK charts, behind [[Englebert Humperdinck (singer)|Englebert Humperdinck]]'s "Release Me". "Penny Lane" did reach #1 in the United States, with "Strawberry Fields Forever" peaking at #8.

In the U.S., both songs were also subsequently included on the LP ''[[Magical Mystery Tour]]'', which was only released as a six-track double-EP in the UK. The LP format is now the official version in The Beatles discography.

== Composition and recording ==
Lennon began writing the song in late 1966, while in Almeria, [[Spain]] filming [[Richard Lester]]'s ''[[How I Won The War]],'' though he can be seen and heard playing the introductory notes on a [[melodica]] in a hotel room in the film "[[The Beatles: The First U.S. Visit]]" which was filmed in February 1964.

Lennon and McCartney's songs shared a similar theme of nostalgia for their childhood in [[Liverpool]] and both referred to actual locations there, but they also had strong surrealistic and psychedelic overtones. [[Strawberry Field]] was a [[Salvation Army]] orphanage just around the corner from Lennon's boyhood home in [[Woolton]]. Lennon and his childhood friends [[Pete Shotton]] and [[Ivan Vaughan]] used to play in the trees behind the orphanage. 

The period of its composition was one of momentous change and dislocation for Lennon: The Beatles had just retired from touring after one of the most difficult periods of their career, including the infamous [[John Lennon#"More popular than Jesus" controversy|"more popular than Jesus" controversy]] and their disastrous tour of the [[Philippines]]; Lennon's marriage was failing; perhaps most significant of all, he was using increasing quantities of [[psychoactive drug|drug]]s, especially the powerful [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogen]] [[LSD]].    Although there are no obvious references to drugs, the song's style and tone and oblique, [[stream of consciousness]] lyrics often are thought to have been influenced by his LSD experiences. 

The song's groundbreaking production and complex arrangement gave clear evidence of the band's near-total mastery in the studio and their increasingly [[avant-garde]] approach to their music.  It featured extensive overdubbing, the prominent use of reverse tape effects and [[tape loop]]s, and extensive audio compression and equalisation. As well as the standard guitar-bass-drums backing, the arrangement also included piano, [[Mellotron]] (played by McCartney), slide guitar, [[trumpets]], cellos and some unusual instruments including the [[swarmandel]], an [[India]]n stringed instrument which provided the sitar-like sound at the end of each chorus.

The released version of the song is actually an edit of two different performances. The band recorded multiple takes of two quite distinct versions of the song. The first version was (reputedly) an attempt to emulate the [[acid rock]] sound of American bands like [[Jefferson Airplane]], and it featured a relatively basic instrumentation including [[Mellotron]], guitars, bass and drums. For the second version, recorded some weeks later, Lennon had opted for a much more complex arrangement (scored by [[George Martin]]) that included trumpets and cellos, along with the prominent sound of backwards cymbals during the verses.

Reviewing the various takes, Lennon decided that he liked the first minute of Take 7 (the "acid rock" version), and the ending of Take 26 (the "orchestral" version). He wanted the finished master to combine these sections from the two versions, so he nonchalantly gave producer George Martin the task of somehow joining them together.

The problem was that the two versions were played in different keys and tempos. Fortunately for Martin and his engineers, the faster version was also in the higher key, and so the two were reasonably easy to combine. The edit is subtle but detectable, at one minute into the song, though some CDs may show the edit at 59 seconds.  (The widely-repeated story is that the first version had to be speeded up and the second had to be slowed down.  Comparison of the original versions with the final one shows that both of the original versions were slowed down, the second by more than the first.)  The pitch-shifting used in joining the versions also gave Lennon's lead vocal a subtle "off-kilter" quality. 

Perhaps most distinctive of all was the instrument that produced the [[flute]]-like sound in the song's introduction &mdash; a [[Mellotron]], recently purchased by Lennon and brought in to the Abbey Road studio especially for the song.  This innovative British-made electronic keyboard used eight-second tape segments of real instruments such as strings (used on take 1 of the song) and flutes (on takes 2 through 7). The Beatles were one of the first rock bands to acquire a Mellotron and "Strawberry Fields Forever" is believed to be the first use of the instrument on a pop recording. As a result of The Beatles' patronage, the instrument was rapidly taken up by other groups and used on other famous recordings of the [[psychedelic]] era by [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], [[Family (band)|Family]] and [[The Rolling Stones]]. The Mellotron used in this song is currently owned by [[Trent Reznor]] of [[Nine Inch Nails]].

Contrary to belief of the [[Paul Is Dead]] hoax supporters, Lennon is actually saying "cranberry sauce" at the end of the song and not "I buried Paul", a fact that Lennon himself confirmed in a 1980 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview. He stated it was a kind of icing on the cake of the weirdness of song, where anything he might have imagined saying would have been appropriate.

== Promotion and reception ==
The song made it to number two on the British charts.  The number one single at the time was [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]'s "Release Me".  (An interesting note is that until February 1969, there was no single definitive singles chart in the UK.  The retroactive determination of "British chart history" flows smoothly from [[NME]]'s 1950s chart through [[Record Retailer]]'s expanded chart, which began in 1960, into the one compiled by the British Market Research Bureau that is used today.  "Strawberry Fields"/"Penny Lane" was ranked as a number one entry on [[Melody Maker]]'s weekly singles chart.)<ref>http://uproar.fortunecity.com/galaxy/399/extranoones.htm</ref>

The promotional film for the song is now recognized as one of the first and most successful conceptual [[music video]]s, featuring reverse film effects, [[stop motion]] animation, disconcerting jump cuts from daytime to nighttime and (among other things) The Beatles playing, then pouring paint over and smashing an upright piano. It was filmed on [[January 30]], [[1967]] in [[Knole Park]] in [[Sevenoaks]]. The exact location is fairly easy to find, being on one of the main roads through the park with a recognisable tree. Though filmed at the same time as the "[[Penny Lane]]" video, it is considerably more groundbreaking and adventurous (which probably has to do with the harsher tone of the song). Both videos were selected by [[New York]]'s [[MoMA]] as two of the most influential music videos in the late [[1960s]]; both originally were broadcast in the United States in early 1967 on the variety show ''Hollywood Palace'', with [[Liberace]] as host.

The song gave its name to the [[Strawberry Fields Memorial]] in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]], near the site of John Lennon's assassination.

[[Brian Wilson]] claimed that 'Strawberry Fields Forever' was partially responsible for the collapse of [[the Beach Boys]]' legendary unfinished album '[[SMiLE]]'. Wilson first heard the song on his car radio while driving, and was so affected by it that he had to pull over until the song finished. He then remarked to his companion (either wryly or in despair, according to the version of the story) that The Beatles had "got there first" (i.e., to the sound he was trying to achieve with the new album). [[SMiLE]] was shelved shortly afterwards.

Before playing the song on his radio show in Jan 2006, BBC Radio Two DJ [[Mark Radcliffe]] said it could be described "without fear of contradiction as the greatest double-A side ever".

== Pop culture ==
* American baseball player [[Darryl Strawberry]] was known as a "[[Baseball jargon#G|good hit, no field]]" kind of player during his career in the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]], and was also a troubled man off the field. A wag at ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' hypothesized what his version of [[Purgatory]] would be like: "Strawberry fields forever!"
* After he was arrested for illegal drugs, parody music maker [[Bob Rivers]] recorded a parody of "Strawberry Fields Forever" (titled "Strawberry Rehabs Forever") which popped up on radio stations (mostly morning "comedic" radio shows such as [[John Boy and Billy]]).
* Jack Jones' biography of [[Mark David Chapman]] ([[John Lennon]]'s murderer) is entitled ''Let Me Take You Down'', which is the first line of the song.
* [[Dominic Monaghan]] (of ''[[Lord of the Rings (film)|Lord of the Rings]]'' fame, and who plays [[Charlie Pace]] on ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'') has "Living is easy with eyes closed" tattooed on his left arm. He also said he can play "Strawberry Fields Forever" on his guitar.
