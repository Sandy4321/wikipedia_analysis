== Earthquake ==

The earthquake of 15 April 1185 in the region of [[East Midlands]] was one of the largest and most damaging earthquakes the British Isles had ever encountered. The magnitude has been estimated at something around 5 Mw. Some think the epicenter the earthquake was close to the town of [[Nottingham]] in East Midlands. Some references talk of the earthquake happening somewhere offshore in the North Sea east of north England and may have been felt as far away as Norway.<ref name=Mussondata>

There are reports of complete villages being totally demolished. One was the village of Raleigh
and another was the village of Danethorpe.  Another hamlet that may have been damaged was [[Grimston, Nottinghamshire|Grimston]], now referred to as Wellow, but that is debatable as the land was used for expansion of [[Rufford Abbey]] and there is confusion as to what actually happened to the small hamlet.<ref name=Mussondata/>

The earthquake epicenter has also been suggested to be in or around [[Lincolnshire]]. However some sources indicate it could possibly be anywhere from Dogger Banks to East Midlands. The historian [[Matthew Paris]] did not report it as being felt in London. His history records show that the first major earthquake in England since 1133 was the one of 13 February 1247.<ref name=Musson1994/>

== Damage ==

Masonry houses were knocked down completely, which indicates an intensity more than 7 EMS at certain locations. [[Ralph of Diceto]] reported in writings done in London that it struck in northern England and that <U+201C>in some places buildings were destroyed<U+201D>. There is also reports that stones were split (<U+201C>petrae enim scissae sunt<U+201D>); stone houses were knocked down;<ref name=Musson1994/> and that parts of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] was brought down due to the earthquake. The damage to Lincoln cathedral has been a controversial issue because it can't be determined to what extent the earthquake damaged it and what parts fell on their own due to poor construction.<ref name=Mussondata/>
