'''Pointe-Claire''' is an [[Greater Montreal|on-island suburb]] of [[Montreal]] in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. Pointe-Claire is largely residential in character, but is also the site of a lot of economic activity, such as retail activity, light manufacturing, various corporate offices, and a hospital. The symbol of the town is the [[Pointe-Claire Windmill]].

==History==
[[File:CarteIsleMontreal1700.jpg|thumb|left|alt=1700s map of Montreal Island.|On a map of the Island of Montreal dated 1700, the words "Pointe" and "Pointe Claire" are visible.]]

Pointe-Claire was first described by [[Nicolas Perrot]] in his account of 1669, and the name Pointe-Claire appeared on a map as early as 1686. Although [[Samuel de Champlain]] canoed through the  area in 1613, he reported no village or dwelling visible.<ref name=alapc>{{cite book|title=A la pointe claire|year=2005|publisher=Conseil du patrimoine de Montreal|isbn=2-9808545-4-9|pages=3<U+2013>47}}</ref> The [[toponym]] Pointe-Claire refers to the peninsula, or point, where the windmill, convent, and the [[Saint-Joachim de Pointe-Claire Church]] are sited. The point extends into [[Lac Saint-Louis|Lake Saint-Louis]] and has a clear view of its surroundings.<ref name="toponymie">{{cite web|author=toponymie|title=Pointe-Claire: Origine et signification|url=http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/ToposWeb/fiche.aspx?no_seq=388469|publisher=Commission de toponymie of Qu<U+00E9>bec|accessdate=27 September 2012}}</ref>

The first grant of land under the [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneurial system]] was in 1684 to Pierre Cabassier, for a lot just east of Pointe Charlebois.<ref>{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=Brian|title=A History of Pointe-Claire|year=1985|page=18}}</ref> Under the seigneurial system, the [[Society of Saint-Sulpice|Selpicians]] had to build a mill for the colonists, who in turn had to grind their grain there at a set fee.

In 1707, after the [[Great Peace of Montreal]] was signed in 1701, the Chemin du Roy (now Lakeshore Road) from [[Dorval]] to the western tip of [[Montreal Island]] was opened having been ordered by intendant [[Jacques Raudot]],<ref name=alapc/> and the parish was subdivided in three c<U+00F4>tes: St. R<U+00E9>my (present-day Boulevard-des-Sources), St. Jean and St. Charles. Between c<U+00F4>tes St. R<U+00E9>my and St. Charles lay 33 lots (numbered 145 to 177). These were generally three [[arpent]]s wide by 20 or 30 deep. Up to this time Pointe-Claire had only been accessible by boat.

In 1713 the seminary formed a parish on the land that now includes Pointe-Claire and much of the West Island, and in 1714 a church was built at the point, at the site of the present-day church.<ref name="matthews">{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=Brian|title=A History of Pointe-Claire|year=1985}}</ref> Up to that time the area was served by an itinerant missionary priest. Initially the church was called Sain-Francois-de-Sales, but it was renamed six months later to Saint-Joachim de la pointe claire. The church and presbytery, both built of stone, formed a fort about two arpents (7000 m<U+00B2>) in area, surrounded by stakes. The construction was ordered by [[Charles de Beauharnois de la Boische, Marquis de Beauharnois|Governor Beauharnois]] our of fear of the [[Iroquois]]. The point was used as a stopover by [[voyageurs]] en route for the back country.<ref name=alapc/>

In 1728-9 the first lots were granted, near the fort, to a blacksmith and to a carpenter. By 1765 there were 783 residents, 74 lots owned by 35 individuals, and 19 houses, some built of stone, but most of wood.<ref name=alapc/>

In 1854 the municipality of Saint-Joachim-de-la-Pointe-Claire was defined, and the name eventually shortened to Pointe-Claire.<ref name="toponymie" />

The [[Grand Trunk Railway]] built a line in 1855, linking Pointe-Claire to Montreal. This brought people, and with them property development in an area that up to then had been largely agricultural. It also improved the welfare of farmers by providing a ready market for their goods. Suburban development began in 1893 when Otto Frederick Lilly acquired land spanning Boulevard Saint Jean. He used his influence with the Canadian Pacific Railway to have a station added to the line at the end of Cedar avenue, which he also paved from there down to Lakeshore Road. Both sides of Cedar Avenue were built up by 1920.  Provincial highway number 2 (now [[Autoroute 20 (Quebec)|Autoroute 20]]) was built alongside the railway in 1940, following expropriation of property.  This led to a move of the much of the town from the south to the north of the highway, namely the town hall, recreation centre, police station, and fire station.<ref name="matthews"/>

After the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act of 1867]] Pointe-Claire was included in the new federal riding of [[Jacques Cartier (electoral district)|Jacques Cartier]]. In the election of the 7th of August, the men ([[suffrage]] did not extend to women until 1940) of Pointe-Claire elected the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] [[Guillaume Gamelin Gaucher]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jacques Cartier, Quebec (1867 - 1952)|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/FederalRidingsHistory/hfer.asp?Language=E&Search=Det&Include=Y&rid=313|publisher=Parliament of Canada|accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref>

In 1900 a major fire destroyed much of village. It was discovered in an uninhabited building around 02:00 on the morning of 22 May. The wind caused the fire to spread to surrounding houses. The only water supply was from village wells or carried in buckets from the river. A small two-wheeled hose reel and hand pump was the only village fire protection. Locals failed to put out the fire and asked for help from Montreal. Equipment was sent by train but did not arrive in time to help. The worst of the damage was on the rue de l'<U+00E9>glise. In all about 30 buildings were destroyed, including the post office, the town hall, and the residences of about 200 people.<ref>{{cite book|last=Milne|first=George E.R.|title=Recollections of Early Pointe Claire: Fire in Pointe Claire: May 22, 1900|year=1965|publisher=West Island School Commission|location=Pointe Claire, Quebec|pages=24|url=http://www.haya.qc.ca/fire/19000522.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://grandquebec.com/nouvelles-quebec/incendie-pointe-claire|title=Conflagration <U+00E0> la Pointe-Claire|language=French|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>

In 2002, as part of the [[2002<U+2013>2006 municipal reorganization of Montreal]], Pointe-Claire was merged into [[Montreal]] and became a borough.  However, after political changes ([[Quebec general election, 2003]] and the [[Quebec municipal referendums, 2004]]) it was re-constituted as an independent city in 2006.

==Geography==
The shoreline of Pointe-Claire along [[Lac Saint-Louis]] is at about 30 metres above sea level and rises along a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] by about 30 metres not far from shore, more steeply in the west. The eastern side has a soil rich in clay, which was once used for brick making, while the western side is stonier and limestone strata, once quarried, can be seen at the Beaconsfield Golf Course.<ref>{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=Brian|title=A History of Pointe-Claire|year=1985|page=17}}</ref> Stone used in the construction of [[Pont Victoria|Victoria Bridge]] was quarried in Pointe-Claire.<ref name="toponymie" /> Pointe-Claire is bounded on the north by [[Dollard-des-Ormeaux]], on the east by [[Dorval]], on the south by [[Lac Saint-Louis]], and on the west by [[Kirkland, Quebec|Kirkland]] and [[Beaconsfield, Quebec|Beaconsfield]].

==Economy==
The city has a large business and industrial park spanning both sides of [[Quebec Autoroute 40]]. The manufacturing sector is the largest provider of jobs in Pointe-Claire, with 7,005 employess or 23.7 percent of employment. Employment in manufacturing has been declining, while employment has been growing in healthcare and social services. Retail is the second biggest sector with 17.7 percent of the total. Major employers (more than 500 employees) include: [[Future Electronics]], [[Lakeshore General Hospital]], [[Avon Products|Avon]], Hewitt <U+00C9>quipement ([[Caterpillar Inc.|CAT]] dealer), City of Pointe-Claire, Lumen, [[Bell Expressvu|Bell TV]], and [[Epicor]]. Employers of more than 200 employees include: [[Merck KGaA|Merck]], [[R<U+00E9>no-D<U+00E9>p<U+00F4>t]], El Ran Furniture, [[Tyco Healthcare|Tyco]] Medical, [[Hudson's Bay Company]], and [[FPInnovations]].<ref name="economic profile">{{cite web|title=Pro<U+FB01>l <U+00E9>conomique: juillet 2010|url=http://collections.banq.qc.ca/ark:/52327/bs1989520|publisher=l<U+2019>Agglom<U+00E9>ration de Montr<U+00E9>al,|accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref>
