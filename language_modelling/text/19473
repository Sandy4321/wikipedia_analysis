'''Romualdas Marcinkus''' (22 July 1907 &ndash; 29 March 1944) was a [[Lithuania]]n [[fighter pilot|pilot]]. Marcinkus participated in an early trans-European flight on 25 June 1934, and was the only Lithuanian pilot to serve in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) during the [[Second World War]]. In his youth Romualdas Marcinkus was a Lithuanian multifold [[soccer|football]] champion and a playing coach for the [[Lithuania national football team]].

While serving in the [[Lithuanian Air Force]], Marcinkus was a [[paratrooper]] instructor, and headed the Aviation sport and physical education department, and during his later years coached a junior football team. After the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Soviet occupation of Lithuania]] early in the Second World War,  Marcinkus left Lithuania and enlisted in the [[French Air Force]]. After the [[Battle of France]] and the French capitulation, Marcinkus escaped to Britain, where he flew for the RAF. As a pilot for [[No. 1 Squadron RAF]], he took part in various missions, including escorting bombers and [[night fighters|night combat]]. On 12 February 1942, during [[Operation Cerberus]], he was shot down, became a prisoner of war, and sent to [[Stalag Luft III]].

At Stalag Luft III Romualdas Marcinkus became an active member of an underground group of prisoners who organized and executed the [[Stalag Luft III#The "Great Escape"|Great Escape]]. Marcinkus was responsible for analyzing the [[German Reich|German]] railway schedules - a vital part of the plan. On the night of 25 March 1944, Marcinkus became one of 76 servicemen who escaped the Stalag. After several days he was recaptured by the [[Gestapo]] and executed. 

At the end of the Second World War, Lithuania [[Occupation of the Baltic states|lost its independence]] and Romualdas Marcinkus was largely forgotten. His memory was kept alive by the Lithuanian <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9> press. After Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, more detailed accounts of his life were published there and abroad.                 

==Early life==
Romualdas Marcinkus was born on 22 July 1907 in the provincial [[Lithuania|Lithuanian]] town of [[Jurbarkas]]. At the time Jurbarkas, as well of the rest of Lithuania, [[Partitions of Poland|was]] part of the [[Russian Empire]]. Romualdas' father, Pranas Marcinkaus, served as a [[policeman]] in Jurbarkas, [[Taurag<U+0117>]], and [[Rum<U+0161>i<U+0161>k<U+0117>s]]. His mother, Honorata Kroaz<U+0117>-Marcinkien<U+0117>, came from town dwellers family of French origins.<ref name=SVIDER>{{cite book | last = Sviderskyt<U+0117> | first = Gra<U+017E>ina | authorlink = Gra<U+017E>ina Sviderskyt<U+0117> | coauthors = | title = "Uragano" kapitonas | publisher = Artseria | date = 2004 | location = Vilnius | pages = 327 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 9986-716-38-1 }}</ref>{{Rp|317}} Romualdas Marcinkus' cousin, Vanda Kroaz<U+0117>-<U+0160>estakauskien<U+0117>, stated that the Kroaz<U+0117> family's origins in Lithuania began with a Frenchman named Courvoisier, who came to Lithuania with [[Napoleon]]'s army during the [[French invasion of Russia]] in the 19th century and married a local Lithuanian woman.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|28}}

Romaualdas was the eldest of five children in the family. After his younger brother died during childhood he became the family's only son. Following the [[First World War]] Lithuania [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|successfully reestablished its independence]] and the first [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Jurbarkas was established. Soon afterwords, Romualdas Marcinkus attended the institution, and became passionate about sports, especially football. Romualdas, or Romas as his friends called him, played football for the local team. Marcinkus was known for his stamina and discipline among his peers.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|318}}

==In Lithuanian army service==
[[File:Lithuanian cadets near War school in Kaunas 1938.jpg|thumb|Gates of the Kaunas Military School. Marcinkus graduated from here in 1928]] 
At age 17,  Marcinkus moved from Jurbarkas to [[Kaunas]], the [[temporary capital of Lithuania]]. In Kaunas, he attended the Higher German School.<ref name=KAM>{{cite web | first= | last= |  title=Kapitonas Romualdas Marcinkus - tarpukario futbolo legenda | date=2009-09-01 | publisher=KAM | url =http://kariuomene.kam.lt/lt/kariuomenes_struktura/karines_oro_pajegos/karo_lakunu_portretai/karo_lakunai_1919_-1940_m./kapitonas_romualdas_marcinkus_-_tarpukario_futbolo_legenda.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2009-11-20 | language = }}</ref>  After graduating from the German School, he enrolled at the Kaunas Military School, intending to enlist in the [[Lithuanian army]].  

During this time the Lithuanian army was expanding and modernizing. The [[Lithuanian Air Force]] was especially targeted for rapid development and service in this branch was prestigious. Some of its earlier members such as [[Jurgis Dobkevi<U+010D>ius]] and [[Antanas Gustaitis]] were instrumental in improving on [[Aeronautics|aeronautical]] designs. While at the military school Marcinkus played for the KSK (''Kauno sporto klubas'') football club.<ref name=ENC>{{Citation | contribution = Romualdas Marcinkus | editor-last = Rudzikas| editor-first = Zenonas| title = [[Universal Lithuanian Encyclopedia]] | volume = 14  | pages = 800 | publisher = [[Science and Encyclopaedia Publishing Institute]] | place = Vilnius | year = 2008|ISBN=sssdsdd}}</ref>{{Rp|253-254}} After his father's death in 1927, Marcinkus took on the responsibility of supporting his remaining family, he also began playing football for [[LFLS Kaunas]].<ref name=KAM/> 

The aviator [[Steponas Darius]] with associates had established the Lietuvos Fizinio Lavinimo S<U+0105>junga, which soon became one of the leading club in Lithuania. Marcinkus joined the club and won a national championship during his first season.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|47}} On July 27, 1927, Marcinkus played for [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] in an international match. Although they lost, Marcinkus managed to score his first goal in an international game. The Lithuanian team's coach predicted a bright future for Marcinkus in  football. At that time football was among the most popular sports in Kaunas.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|48}}                               
[[File:Romuladas Marcinkus reporting.jpg|thumb|left|Romualdas Marcinkus reporting after a flight]]
[[File:Romualdas Marcinkus (2).jpg|thumb|left|Marcinkus later became a paratrooper instructor in the Lithuanian Air Force]]
In 1928 Romualdas Marcinkus graduated from the Kaunas Military School and received a commission as an infantry lieutenant. From 1930 until 1932 he attended the [[Vytautas the Great]] Military Institute's aviation department and became a [[military pilot]]. While pursuing his military career, Marcinkus did not abandon his passion for football. He became a Lithuanian football champion three times. His team won the cup for the [[Baltic States]]' championship twice, and he played over forty games for the national team.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|318}} Eventually, Marcinkus became a coach for the national team. He also wrote several articles about football and ethics in sports. His many successes made him a [[celebrity]] in his home county. He is considered one of the best Lithuanian players of that time.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|319}} 

In 1933, Marcinkus advanced to the rank of lieutenant, which was conferred by  [[President of Lithuania|Lithuanian President]], [[Antanas Smetona]]. In the same year he married Aleksandra Lingyt<U+0117>.<ref name=KAM/> Lingyt<U+0117> was also a prominent Lithuanian sportswoman; she won several basketball championships for Lithuania. Around the same time, inspired by [[Klemensas Martinkus]], Marcinkus became a [[paratrooper]] instructor. Soon he became a parachuting master in the Air Force and  participated in various [[air show]]s.<ref name=KAM/>

In 1934 Marcinkus was transferred to the [[air reconnaissance]] department, there he started improving his expertise in independent flying, [[mapping]], [[photography]], and weapon systems. 1934 proved to be a challenging year for Marcinkus. [[Antanas Gustaitis]], a prominent Lithuanian aircraft [[constructor]] and Commander of Lithuanian Military Aviation, invited Marcinkus to participate in a trans-European flight, along with [[Jonas Liorentas]], [[Juozas Namikas]], [[Jonas Mik<U+0117>nas]], and [[Kazys Rimkevi<U+010D>ius]]. After detailed planing and preparation, the trans-European flight was begun in the same year. During the 25 days of their flight, the pilots flew three of Gustaitis' designed aircraft, the [[ANBO IV]]s, over 10,000 kilometers and visited twelve European capitals.<ref name=ENC/>{{Rp|253-254}} The Lithuanian pilots were warmly welcomed in the countries they visited. They were received by the [[British Royal Family]] and [[Italia]]n [[dictator]] [[Benito Mussolini]].<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|320}} 
[[File:Karo Aviacijos garbes zenklas - Plieniniai Sparnai.jpg|thumb|''Steel Wings'' (''Plieno sparnai''), the highest award in Lithuanian military aviation. Marcinkus was decorated with the wings in 1939]]
Upon his return, Marcinkus was promoted to the rank of [[Captain (land)|Captain]] and  decorated with the [[Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas]] Knight's Cross.<ref name=KAM/> He was also named head of the Aviation Physical Education Department. He went on to establish a junior football team and teach [[German language|German]]. His superiors noted that Romualdas Marcinkus seemed more interested in sports than in his military duties at that time.<ref name=KAM/> His sporting career ended in 1938, however, when he injured a knee and was forced to abandon football .<ref name=KAM/> Despite the fact that he was decorated with ''Steel Wings'' (''Plieno sparnai''), the highest award in Lithuanian Military Aviation,<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|320}} the following year proved very trying on a personal level. He was burdened with debts and underwent a [[nervous breakdown]]. His military career was interrupted by a scandal and he was transferred to the reserves.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|320}}         

While the [[Winter War]] was gathering momentum, Marcinkus argued for supporting [[Finland]], but Lithuania remained neutral during the conflict. Nevertheless, some Lithuanians left to fight alongside the Finns. In 1940 Marcinkus also left Lithuania, apparently intending to help Finland,<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|145}} although the war had ended by the time he arrived. Soon afterwards he traveled to [[France]], then at war with Germany.

==In French army service==

Marcinkus arrived in France in mid-March of 1940 and immediately requested acceptance into the French Air Force.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|146}} Bureaucratic delays hindered his enlistment. By the time these hurdles were cleared, the [[Battle for France]] was rapidly drawing to a close. It is possible, however, that Marcinkus succeeded in shooting down several [[Luftwaffe|German military planes]] during his short career in the French Air Force.<ref name=KAM/>

After France surrendered, Marcinkus managed to make his way to the [[French colonies]] in [[Africa]] ([[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]]).<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|321}} He decided to go to Great Britain and continue fighting, but the French army's terms of armistice at [[Second Armistice at Compi<U+00E8>gne|Compi<U+00E8>gne]] and [[Attack on Mers-el-K<U+00E9>bir|tensions between Britain and France]] made this difficult. On 12 August 1940 he was finally demobilized from the French army. Marcinkus and some of his associates concocted a daring plan to commandeer several aircraft without authorization and fly to England. The plan was not executed due to increased security at airfields and other circumstances.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|321}} He finally received the necessary documents enabling him to go to Britain in autumn of 1940.

==In British service==
[[File:Hurricane mk1 r4118 fairford arp.jpg|thumb|In RAF Marcinkus flew with [[Hurricane (plane)| Hurricane]] [[fighter aircraft]]]]
In October 1940 Romualdas Marcinkus reached [[Liverpool]], and from there travelled on to [[London]]. On 24 December of the same year, Marcinkus became a pilot of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). To achieve this, he changed some of his personal data, he stated that he was three years younger, otherwise he would have been too old for service in the RAF.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|182}} At that time, his homeland Lithuania, had already [[Occupation of the Baltic States|lost its independence]], and the Lithuanian Air Force, was rapidly liquidated by its occupiers. Throughout the years,  Maricinkus maintained close contacts with the Lithuanian [[attach<U+00E9>]] in Britain in order to receive news about Lithuania and his family.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|182}} 

On 1 January 1941 Romualdas Marcinkus was transferred to a training base. He demonstrated his flying skills hoping to fly the British [[Hurricane (plane)| Hurricane]] [[fighter aircraft]]. He was successful and was transferred to [[No. 1 Squadron RAF]]. Romuladas Marcinkus became the only Lithuanian pilot to fly for the RAF during the Second World War.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|322}} Marcinkus wrote in his letter about the new challenges laying ahead:

{{blockquote|I was transferred to the [[night fighter]]s - at that time the most dangerous kind of military aviation. But I like danger - I faced danger during my entire life,  in flying, sports, and personal life. With this I am satisfied, but...I am lacking warmth and the comfort of my personal life in this country of "cold slob weather and so called correctness".<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|182}}}}      
 
In one of the Marcinkus letters to the Lithuanian envoy, Bronius Balutis, Romualdas notes that he shot down his first German [[bomber]] [[Dornier Do 17]] in March. Marcinkus also wrote that he was gathering skills and knowledge in order to make a contribution towards liberating Lithuania and restoring its independence.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|183}}  

In the RAF Romualdas Marcinkus carried out multiple tasks - various training missions, night combat, escort of bombers and others. In June Marcinkus and his squadron members engaged into prolonged [[air combat]] with Germans. As later reports confirm, the Germans lost 4 [[Me 109]] fighter aircraft, one of which was shot down by Marcinkus.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|198}} The original report submitted by Marcinkus claiming one Me 109 shot down on 21 June 1941 is held in [[The National Archives]], he states that he fired two short bursts from his guns from 100 yards behind the German, a Sergeant Blasil, also of 1 Squadron then witnessed the plane break up in the air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7737796|title=Air Ministry combat reports<U+2014>Marcinkus, R|work=DocumentsOnline|publisher=[[The National Archives]]|format=fee usually required to view pdf of original report|accessdate=3 March 2010}}</ref> On the allied side one [[United States|American]] pilot was missing. The last mission Marcinkus carried out as a RAF pilot was on 12 February 1942.

On 11 February 1942 German operation code named [[Operation Cerberus]] had commenced. In which a German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' squadron consisting of ''[[German battlecruiser Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]]'', ''[[German battlecruiser Gneisenau|Gneisenau]]'', ''[[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|Prinz Eugen]]'', supported by a number of smaller ships, attempted to sail to their home bases via the [[English Channel]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Vego | first = Milan | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Naval Strategy and Operations in Narrow Seas | publisher = Routledge | date = 2003 | location = | pages = 331 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0714653896 }}</ref>{{Rp|214}}  Six fighters from No. 1 Squadron RAF were tasked with intercepting German ships and attacking German torpedo boats.

==Great Escape and death==
{{see also2|[[Stalag Luft III#The .22Great Escape.22|The Great Escape]]}}

[[File:Model Stalag Luft III.jpg|thumb|A model of [[Stalag Luft III]], Marcinkus would spend two years there]]
Marcinkus was sent to [[Stalag Luft III]], a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] near [[<U+017B>aga<U+0144>|Sagan]] that housed captured [[air force]] servicemen during the [[Second World War]]. The camp was restructured several times in order to accommodate more POWs. It would eventually hold over 10,000 inmates. Marcinkus was the only known Lithuanian at the camp.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|82}}   

RAF [[Squadron Leader]] [[Roger Bushell]] selected inmates and began planning an escape, at first focused on digging a tunnel. Already experienced from earlier escapes, Bushell became the nominal leader of this endeavor.<ref>{{cite book | last = Kozak-Holland | first = Mark | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Project Lessons from the Great Escape (Stalag Luft III) | publisher = Multi-Media Publications Inc. | date = 2007 | location = | pages = 261 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1895186811 }}</ref>{{Rp|322}} The group expanded and accepted Marcinkus into their ranks<U+2014>his fluent command of several languages, most importantly German, was seen as valuable.  

The prisoners delegated various tasks amongst themselves in order to better implement their escape.

{{blockquote|While I didn't knew Marcinkus directly, but I remember him very well. I remember him as friendly guy, having a good character, he also had a phenomenal memory. He was especially good at memorizing numbers, dates, and after analyzing a pile of information, he made a precise compilation of the [[Reich]]'s railway schedules. These schedules were used by men, who during the Great Escape traveled by train, including me...He was fluent in German, perhaps this allowed him to bribe or negotiate with German officials in order to get needed information, but I know for sure, that Marcinkus' analyzed vast amounts of information and became very useful during the Great Escape.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|258-259}}}}              
        
During March 1944, final preparations for the escape gathered momentum. In its original form about 200 prisoners were to escape.

He was selected to lead a group of four prisoners posing as Lithuanian workers traveling back to Lithuania.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|264}} The group's prospects hinged on the hope that the Germans encountered on the way would not speak or understand Lithuanian, as Marcinkus was the only member fluent in that language.<ref name=Escape/>{{Rp|135}} 

On the night of 25 March, the prisoners enacted their plan. Serious problems arose immediately. The tunnel hatch proved difficult to open and the tunnel exit was several metres short of the relatively safe forested area. These problems led to delays and only 76 POWs managed to make their break for freedom.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|265-268}} As originally intended, Marcinkus was one of the first ten to escape.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|265-268}} 

Marcinkus and the three prisoners in his group posing as Lithuanians - Tim Walenn, Henri Picard and Gordon Bretell - managed to reach a train heading towards [[Danzig]] (now Gdansk, Poland). Most likely, they intended to travel to [[East Prussia]], cross the Lithuanian border, and somehow cross the [[Baltic Sea]] to neutral [[Sweden]].<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|276-279}} However, officials at the Stalag had discovered the escape and began manhunts. Marcinkus and his group travelled further than most of the escapees, but were captured by the [[Gestapo]] near [[Schneidem<U+00FC>hl]] on March 26.<ref name=SVIDER/>{{Rp|276-279}}<ref name=Justice/>{{Rp|207}} Marcinkus and his associates were brought to [[Stalag XXB]] and spent the night there.

After Lithuania [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|successfully re-established its independence]], interest in his story gained momentum in Lithuania and elsewhere. In Jurbarkas, a street was named after him. The [[Lithuanian Air Force]] now sponsors the ''Marcinkus Pistol Marksmanship Cup''. In 2001 the British Ambassador in Vilnius gave Marcinkus' previously unclaimed war medals to a surviving relative, his nephew, Alvydas Gab<U+0117>nas, during a commemorative ceremony. The RAF provided a fly-past of [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|Harrier jets]] from Marcinkus' No. 1 Squadron RAF, in which one aircraft saluted the ceremony. In the same year a plaque was dedicated to honour the famous Lithuanian pilot in Kaunas.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Pagerbtas kpt.
