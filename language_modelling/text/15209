The Wu Hu uprising was one of the most devastating events in Chinese history, causing close to 270 years of division, the longest period China had been divided since the Warring States Era. 
Wu Hu forces rose up agains the [[Jin Dynasty]] of China who they had formerly served in 304CE, and by 316CE their victory was complete. Jin Chinese forces were forced to retreat south of the Huai river.

==Background==

Most of the Wu Hu tribes had been moved into Jin China by the Chinese imperial government in order to serve as labourers for the Chinese economy(which was badly damaged during the Three Kingdoms period). These tribes, however, maintained their customs and organization, and were seen as a potential threat by some Jin officials, who recommended extermination or expulsion. Unfortunately, this sound advice was not heeded by the Jin court<ref> Li and Zheng, pg 381</ref>.

==Uprising==

===Beginnings of the uprising===

After the devastating war of the Eight Princes, the Jin Dynasty was exhausted and unable to control the barbarian hordes it had moved into its terroritory several decades earlier to provide labour. Taking advantage of this, Xiongnu Chieftain [[Liu Yuan]] rebelled against the Jin Dynasty and soon thousands of other barbarians joined his army in it's fight agains the Jin<ref> Li and Zheng, pg 382</ref>.

In an attempt to make claims to be a legitimate dynasty, Liu Yuan choose his imperial state to be named Han, after the previous Chinese dynasty before the Wei and Jin<ref> Li and Zheng, pg 382</ref>.

===Jin response===

The Jin Dynasty was ineffective in its attempts to halt the uprising. The Jin capital, Luoyang  was open to Liu Yuan's son Liu Chong(who was now commander of the Wu Hu forces), and he attacked Luoyang in 309 and 310 CE twice, without success. However, the Jin Challcenor Sima Yue fled Luoyang in 310CE with 40,000 troops to Shangcheng in Henan in an attempt to flee this threat<ref> Li and Zheng, pg 382</ref>.

After Sima Yue's death, the main Jin forces in Henan, led by Wang Heng, decided to proceed to Shantung to defeat Shi le(one of the Wu Hu generals), but was defeated by the Wu Hu forces and more than 100,000 soldiers perished, resulting in the loss of much of Jin's army<ref> Li and Zheng, pg 383</ref>.

===Capture of Luoyang and Chang'an===

After the defeat of Wang Heng's forces, Jin forces were no longer able to hold Luoyang, who fell to the Wu Hu in 311CE. Upon entering the city, the Wu Hu engaged in a promiscous massacre, killing over 30,000 people and turning the city into a pile of rubble. The Jin emperor was also captured and later killed. Although another Jin regime was set up in Chang'an, it too was captured in 316CE by Liu Chong<ref> Li and Zheng, pg 383</ref>. Following this, millions of Chinese fled to South China to escape barbarian rule.

==Aftermath==

Millions of Chinese were slaughtered by the Wu Hu in the Era following this uprising, and the once-powerful Chinese Empire had crumbled. Henceforth, much of North China was now under alien rule and would remain so until the Sui Dynasty.
