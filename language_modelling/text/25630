'''Tropical Depression Ten''' was the tenth [[tropical cyclone]] of the record-breaking [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The depression formed on August 13 from a [[tropical wave]] that emerged from the west coast of [[Africa]] on August 8. As a result of strong [[wind shear]] the depression remained weak, and it failed to strengthen past tropical depression status. The depression degenerated into a remnant low pressure area on August 14, although the remnants of the storm partially contributed to Tropical Depression Twelve, which eventually became [[Hurricane Katrina]]. No effects, fatalities, or damages were directly associated with the depression.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|10-L 2005 track.png}}
On August 8, a [[tropical wave]] emerged from the west coast of [[Africa]] and entered the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Tracking towards the west, the depression began to show signs of convective organization on August 11. The system continued to develop, and it is estimated that the wave spawned Tropical Depression Ten at 1200 UTC on August 13. At the time, it was located about {{convert|1600|mi|km}} east of [[Barbados]].<ref name="TCR"/> Upon being designated, the depression comprised of a large area of [[convection (meteorology)|convection]], with curved [[tropical cyclone#physical structure|banding features]] and expanding [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]]. However, the environmental conditions were predicted to quickly become unfavorable.<ref>{{cite web|author=Avila|title=Tropical Depression Ten Discussion Number 1|date=August 13, 2005|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-01-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al102005.discus.001.shtml?}}</ref> The depression moved erratically and slowly towards the west, and it failed to intensity significantly due to [[wind shear]]. Late on August 13, it was described as "beginning to look like [[Hurricane Irene (2005)|Irene]]-junior as it undergoes southwesterly mid-level shear beneath the otherwise favorable upper-level outflow pattern". The wind shear was expected to have relented within 48 hours, prompting some forecast models to indicate that the depression would eventually intensify to hurricane status.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stewart|title=Tropical Depression Ten Discussion Number 2|date=August 13, 2005|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-01-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al102005.discus.002.shtml?}}</ref>

By early on August 14 the shear had substantially disrupted the storm, leaving the low-level center of circulation exposed from the area of thunderstorm activity, which was also deteriorating. After moving at a slow drift, the storm began to move towards the west. Forecasters expected it to resume a northwestward track as [[high pressure area|high pressure]] to the south of [[Bermuda]] was forecast to weaken and another high was predicted to form southwest of the [[Azores]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Knabb|title=Tropical Depression Ten Discussion Number 3|date=August 14, 2005|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-01-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al102005.discus.003.shtml?}}</ref> By 1800 UTC on August 14, the strong shear further weakened the storm, and it no longer met the criteria for a tropical cyclone. It degenerated into a remnant low, and as such, the National Hurricane Center issued their last advisory on the tropical depression. Moving westward, the remnant low occasionally produced convective activity before dissipating on August 18.<ref name="TCR"/>

Tropical Depression Twelve formed over the southeastern [[Bahamas]] at 2100 UTC on August 23, partially from the remains of Tropical Depression Ten. While the normal standards for numbering tropical depressions in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] indicate that the old designation is retained when a depression dissipates and regenerates, satellite imagery indicated that a second [[tropical wave]] combined with Tropical Depression Ten north of [[Puerto Rico]] to form a new, more complex weather system, which was then designated as Tropical Depression Twelve.<ref>{{cite web | author = Stewart, Stacy | publisher = [[National Hurricane Center]] | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2005/dis/al122005.discus.001.shtml | title = Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number 1 | date=August 23, 2005 | accessdate = 2009-01-21}}</ref> In a later re-analysis, it was found that the low-level circulation of Tropical Depression Ten had completely detached and dissipated; only the remnant mid-level circulation moved on and merged with the second tropical wave. As a result, the criteria for keeping the same name and identity were not met.<ref name="KatrinaTCR"/>

==Impact==
Because Tropical Depression Ten never approached land as a [[tropical cyclone]], no [[tropical cyclone watches and warnings]] were issued for any land masses. No effects, damages, or fatalities were reported, and no ships reported tropical storm-force winds in association with the depression. The system did not attain tropical storm status; as such, it was not given a name by the [[National Hurricane Center]].<ref name="TCR">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|title=Tropical Depression Ten Tropical Cyclone Report|date=January 17, 2006|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-01-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL102005_Ten.pdf}}</ref> Due to the weak intensity, Tropical Depression Ten did not produce an [[Accumulated Cyclone Energy]] rating,<ref name="TCR"/> which is an approximation of the kinetic energy used by a tropical system.<ref name="ACE">{{cite web| author=Carl Drews| publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder| date=2007-08-24 | accessdate=2008-10-26| title=Separating the ACE Hurricane Index into Number, Intensity, and Duration|url=https://webfiles.colorado.edu/drewsc/www/hurricane/SeparatingTheACE.html}}</ref> Hurricane Katrina, which formed partially as a result of Tropical Depression Ten, would later intensify into a [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5]] hurricane and make landfall in [[Louisiana]], causing severe damage.
