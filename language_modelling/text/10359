''Me Against Myself'' was universally acclaimed by critics across the world, particularly for its [[Experimental music|experimental]], creative [[Fusion (music)|fusion]]<ref name=BoomBox/> of [[contemporary R&B]], [[hip hop music]] (including [[Old-school hip-hop|old-school]] and [[British hip hop]])<ref>{{cite web|title=Jay Sean: 'Ride It'|date=January 21, 2008|author=Alex Fletcher|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/singlesreviews/a87316/jay-sean-ride-it.html|accessdate=2009-12-08}}</ref> and [[Music of India|Indian music]] (including [[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]] and [[Bollywood songs|Bollywood music]]), as well as its social commentary. In the UK, Dan Gennoe of [[Yahoo! Music]] gave the album 8 out of 10 stars, referring to ''Me Against Myself'' as "an album of phenomenally accomplished R&B" and "an album of indisputable quality." He praised the [[Music of Asia|Asian musical]] influence, social commentary, and "well adjusted sense of humour", particularly the "hysterical crisis of integrity" shown in the title track "Me Against Myself" where "rapper Sean mercilessly derides his <U+201C>pansy<U+201D> singing alter ego".<ref name=Yahoo>{{cite web|author=Dan Gennoe|title=Jay Sean - Me Against Myself|publisher=[[Yahoo!

In particular, he also praised the title track "Me Against Myself", where Sean's singer and rapper personae go into [[Rap battle|battle]], for its honesty and self-awareness.<ref name=BBC>{{cite web|author=Antony Hatfield|title=Me Against Myself Review|publisher=[[BBC Music]]|date=2004-11-08|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/8nzf|accessdate=2009-12-05}}</ref>

Tareck Ghoneim of [[Contactmusic.com]] also praised the album, referring to Sean as an "[[British Asian|Asian]] sensation" who is breaking barriers "making [[Pop music|pop songs]] that include sounds from Sean<U+2019>s cultural background and with potential mass appeal." He stated that the "album is progressive in that it shows a fusion of Asian sounds with r<U+2019>n<U+2019>b and pop music."<ref name=Contactmusic>{{cite web|title=Tareck Ghoneim|title=Jay Sean - Me Against Myself - Album Review|publisher=[[Contactmusic.com]]|year=2004|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/home.nsf/webpages/jayseanx22x11x04|accessdate=2009-12-05}}</ref> Caroline Sullivan of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, praising "the Bollysoul arrangements that underscore his vocals", in reference to the fusion of Bollywood and [[soul music]], especially in the song "Stolen".<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news|title=Jay Sean, Me Against Myself (Relentless)|author=Caroline Sullivan|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 November 2004|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2004/nov/05/popandrock.shopping10|accessdate=2009-12-06 | location=London}}</ref> The ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]'' gave the album a score of 3 out of 4 stars.<ref name=Liverpool>{{cite web|title=CD review|work=[[Liverpool Daily Post]]|date=5 November 2004|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-124153082.html|accessdate=2009-12-08}}</ref> Peter Culshaw of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' referred to the album as "highly accomplished R&B, with minor Indian musical elements", but considered the best tracks in the album to be the hip hop tracks "You Don't Know Me" and "Me Against Myself" for their social commentary which deal with Sean's inner conflicts and the difficulties in "trying to make it as an Asian in the hip-hop arena." Culshaw praised Sean's talent and stated that, "currently attracting the attention of demi-god producer [[Timbaland]], it will be fascinating to see how Sean resolves his musical [[schizophrenia]]."<ref name=Telegraph>{{cite news|author=Peter Culshaw|title=Pop CDs of the week: Eminem, Destiny's Child, Jay Sean, Pavement|date=15 November 2004|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/cdreviews/3631877/Pop-CDs-of-the-week-Eminem-Destinys-Child-Jay-Sean-Pavement.html|accessdate=2009-12-06 | location=London}}</ref>

The album received similarly positive reviews in Asia, where its British-Asian fusion sounds were also seen as a novelty. In India, A. Vishnu of ''[[The Hindu]]'' stated that, "After having kick-started the `British sound with an Indian flavour' concept, Sean has created a cutting-edge formula, which appeals to Hip-hop fans and Bhangra enthusiasts alike." He concluded that the "album previews the future of Brit-Bhangra music, which sure is here to stay. It's time to take Bhangra to the next level."<ref name=Hindu/> ''[[The Statesman]]'' stated, "A mixture of R & B, hip hop and rap, it has [[desi]] flavours as well. With bhangra influences in the background, this album is one of the most popular UK Asian crossover offerings till date."<ref name=Statesman>{{cite web|title=Jay Sean: Me Against Myself|work=[[The Statesman]]|date=March 25, 2005|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19223534_ITM|accessdate=2009-12-08}}</ref> In Malaysia, Kiren Kaur of ''[[New Straits Times]]'' also praised the album, referring to the songs "Eyes On You" and "Dance With You" in particular as "dance-floor favourites with the fusion of Desi rhythms with R&B tones."<ref name=Kaur/> In the [[Africa]]n country of [[Zambia]], Candice Soobramoney of the ''[[Zambia Post]]'' gave the album a rating of 8/10.<ref name=Post>{{cite web|title=Good food and fast horses|author=Candice Soobramoney|work=[[Zambia Post]]|date=June 29, 2005|url=http://www.thepost.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=738&fArticleId=2603680|date=2009-12-08}}</ref>

The creativity and experimentalism of his debut album ''Me Against Myself'' later became a point of criticism towards Sean's more mainstream follow-up albums, ''[[My Own Way (album)|My Own Way]]'' (2008) and ''[[All or Nothing (Jay Sean album)|All or Nothing]]'' (2009), for lacking the experimental British-Asian fusion sounds (alongside [[Rishi Rich]]) and the social commentary that had characterized his debut album ''Me Against Myself'', in favour of mainstream American-influenced R&B pop music in his later albums.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mike Diver|title=Jay Sean All or Nothing Review|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2009-12-04|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/5zfd|accessdate=2009-12-05}}</ref><ref name=Batey/> In his review of ''My Own Way'', Angus Batey of ''The Guardian'' stated that Sean "has lost - not for ever, one hopes - the stuff that made him stand out" in ''Me Against Myself''.<ref name=Batey>{{cite news|author=Angus Batey|url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/urban/reviews/story/0,,2276023,00.html|title=Jay Sean, My Own Way|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2009-12-08 | location=London | date=2008-04-25}}</ref> Sean later responded that the reason he gave up on the Indian-R&B fusion music that he helped popularize is because it had eventually become too common in [[Asian Underground]] and [[Indian pop]] music.<ref name=AsianID/>
