The '''2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion''' was an [[industrial disaster]] that occurred on [[February 7]], [[2008]] in [[Port Wentworth, Georgia|Port Wentworth]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[United States]]. Thirteen people were killed and 42 injured when a [[dust explosion]] occurred at a sugar refinery owned by [[Imperial Sugar]]. Dust explosions had been an issue of concern amongst United States authorities since three fatal accidents in 2003, with efforts made to improve safety and reduce the risk of reoccurrence. However, a safety board had criticised this as inadequate.

The refinery was large and old, featuring outdated construction methods. This is thought to have contributed to the fire's severity. The origin of the explosion has been narrowed down to the center of the factory, and is believed to be a basement beneath storage silos. Investgations are ongoing, although deliberate crimminal activity has been ruled out.

As a result of the disaster new safety legislation has been proposed, while the local economy has slumped because the factory remains offline, although Imperial intends to rebuild it and return to production by the end of 2008, with replacement buildings completed by Summer the following year. Legal action has been filed by some victims against the owner and the company hired to clean it. Imperial also say the explosion was the main reason for a major loss in the first quarter of 2008.

==Background==
The sugar refinery was a four-story structure on the bank of the [[Savannah River]] that [[Sugar Land]], [[Texas]]-based [[Imperial Sugar]] had acquired from a previous local owner. Known since construction as the Dixie Crystals refinery, Dixie Crystals being a brand name owned by Imperial since the purchase, it was the main employer in the town of 3,500 prior to the disaster.<ref name="CNN-init">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/02/07/sugar.plant.explosion/index.html |title=Dozens hurt in Georgia sugar refinery explosion |date=2008-02-08 |accessdate=2008-06-17 |publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref><ref name="rebuild"/><ref name="NYT-init-overview"/> It was constructed in 1916 by 400 people who moved from [[Louisiana]] specifically for the purpose, opened the following year and became Imperial's property in 1997 when the latter bought Savannah Foods to form part of a national supply and distribution network to meet demand from businesses such as [[Piggly Wiggly]], [[General Mills]] and [[Wal-Mart]].<ref name="rebuild"/> The refinery sat on a {{convert|160|acre|km2 sqmi}} site and was spread across {{convert|872000|sqft|m2|sigfig=3}} of it.<ref name="USAToday-deahts-8">{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-02-14-refinery-blast_N.htm|title=Crews still battling refinery blast; toll rises to 8|date=2008-02-14 |accessdate=2008-06-22 |publisher=[[USA Today]]}}</ref><ref name="NYT-init-overview">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/09/us/09sugar.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1214147101-FDxU4jy1oY6rejeUzZaMJg&oref=slogin|title=Lives and a Georgia Community<U+2019>s Anchor Are Lost|date=2008-02-09 |accessdate=2008-06-22 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''}}</ref> This makes it the second largest in the US.<ref name="AP-silos-demolished"/>

Workers described the factory as antiquated, with much of the machinery dating back more than 28 years, but say the site was kept in operation because it had good access to rail and shipping links for transport.<ref name="NYT-init-overview"/>

In the last full [[fiscal year]] before the disaster, which ended on [[September 30]], [[2007]], the facility refined 14.51 million [[hundredweight]] of sugar, 9% of the nation's requirements, compared to Imperial's [[Gramercy, Louisiana|Gramercy]], [[Louisiana]] refinery, which refined 11.08 million hundredweight of sugar in the same time period. 90% of the raw sugar supplied to the facility came from overseas in that year, and the company expected the "vast majority" to come in from abroad in the year of the explosion as well.<ref name="Bloomberg"/><ref name="rebuild"/>

In the time leading up to the explosion Imperial Sugar had run into financial difficulties. In the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007 sales fell 8%, while profits were down 50% from that year's fourth quarter and stock also down by half since April 2007. The last two annual reports by Imperial before the explosion stated that any damage to the facility at Port Wentworth would "have a material effect on the company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows."<ref name="rebuild">{{cite news |first=Dan|last=Chapman |url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/business/stories/2008/04/12/sugar_0413.html|title=Sugar refinery near Savannah determined to rebuild|date=2008-04-13 |accessdate=2008-06-19 |publisher=''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]''}}</ref>

Meanwhile, in 2004 the [[U.S. Chemical Safety Board]] - which went on to investigate the disaster at Port Wentworth - conducted a study into the risks presented by dust explosions after three fatal accidents in the year before. The [[West Pharmaceutical Services explosion]] killed six, the [[CTA Acoustics fiberglass insulation manufacturing plant explosion]] killed seven and the [[Hayes Lemmerz automotive parts plant explosion]] killed one, prompting the report. It found that dust explosions posed a severe risk and made a number of recommendations to the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], which remain only partially acted upon. The board continued to be concerned about the potential for further fatal accidents up until Imperial's refinery was the scene of an explosion.<ref name="CSB-Selk-init"/>

==Explosion and emergency response==
[[Image:Imperial Sugar Georgia Two.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An overview of the fire damage to the refinery.]]
The explosion occurred at 7:00 p.m. local time in what was initially believed to be a room where sugar was bagged by workers. Witnesses from across the [[Savannah River]] in [[South Carolina]] reported seeing flames shoot up several stories high.<ref name="CNN-init"/> There were 112 employees on-site at the time.<ref name="OSHA-Act-08">Testimonial record on the{{cite news |url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=TESTIMONIES&p_id=433|title=Combustible Dust Explosion and Fire Prevention Act of 2008|date=2008-03-12 |accessdate=2008-06-22 |publisher=[[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]}}</ref> The explosion occurred in the center of the refinery, where bagging and storage facilities were fed completed product by a network of elevators and [[conveyor belts]].

Ambulances attended the scene from across twelve counties,<ref name="CNN-init"/> and firefighters from three.<ref name="NYT-init-overview"/> The [[United States Coast Guard]] closed off the river in the area, and a firefighting tug boat was used to douse the resulting fire from the river while a helicopter was used to search the river for anyone who may have been thrown into it by the blast.<ref name="CNN-init"/> Refinery workers were brought in to assist with [[search and rescue]] operations as emergency services personnel were unfamiliar with the plant's layout.<ref name="NYT-init-overview"/>

The [[Georgia Emergency Management Agency]] alerted local hospitals to prepare for up to 100 casualties. A doctor at nearby Memorial Health hospital described patients arriving at an emergency [[triage]] as varying in condition from suffering minor burns to their hands to having received 80-90% burns, with many in [[critical condition]],<ref name="CNN-init"/> and one with 95% burns. The victims' ages ranged from 18 to 50. Many victims were placed in artificial comas because they were on life support systems.<ref name="CNN-deaths-5"/> Eight were transported by helicopter to the specialist [[Joseph M.

By [[February 14]], [[2008]], the worst of the fire had been extinguished but the {{convert|100|foot|m}} sugar storage silos remained alight despite attempts to put the fire out by dousing them with thousands of gallons of water from a helicopter. Specialist crews and equipment were called in to complete work tackling the smoldering, molten sugar the silos contained. At this time seven of the eight bodies had been recovered, and an eighth person had died in hospital.<ref name="MSNBC-deaths-8">{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23165158/|title=Death toll in Georgia refinery blast rises to eight|date=2008-02-14 |accessdate=2008-06-22 |publisher=[[MSNBC]]}}</ref>

==Investigation==
[[Image:Imperial Sugar Georgia One.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The explosion was determined to have occurred in this building and two of the three silos visible behind it.]]
The location of the explosion was quickly established as a building used to store refined sugar prior to packaging it and two of three {{convert|100|foot|m}} tall, {{convert|18|in|cm}} thick [[reinforced concrete]] storage silos adjacent to it, as pictured.<ref name="CSB-Selk-init"/><ref name="AP-silos-demolished">{{cite news |url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jnq-lRpUoRXY_jeSCqw3lhlRbB3AD91GK8SG1|title=Ga. sugar refinery demolishing blasted silos|date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2008-06-26 |publisher=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> Heavy equipment had to be used to shore up the partially collapsed structure before firefighters could enter it to search for victims, as well as several other 'key' areas.<ref name="CNN-deaths-5">{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/US/02/09/refinery.blast/index.html|title=Death toll rises at Georgia refinery|date=2008-02-09 |accessdate=2008-06-22 |publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref> The explosive substance was also identified within 24 hours to be sugar dust.<ref name="Bloomberg"/>

Federal investigations by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) and the [[U.S. Chemical Safety Board]] (CSB) were launched and are continuing, with methods employed including interviewing witnesses, checking documentation and on-scene examination of the plant.<ref name="rebuild"/> OSHA arrived within two hours and the CSB within 48 hours.<ref name="OSHA-Act-08"/> Other brief investigations were conducted by state firefighters and police and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives]], but these were ended quickly after confirming there was no evidence of the explosion and fire having been deliberately started.<ref name="CSB-Selk-init">Press Release{{cite news |url=http://www.csb.gov/index.cfm?folder=news_releases&page=news&NEWS_ID=417|title=Statement of CSB Investigations Manager Stephen Selk, P.E., Updating the Public on the Investigation of the Imperial Sugar Company Explosion and Fire, Savannah, Georgia|date=2008-04-17 |accessdate=2008-06-21 |publisher=[[U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board]]}}</ref> In a press conference held on [[February 17]], [[2008]] one of the six members of the CSB team said that the explosion showed the ongoing risk from dust explosions despite their report highlighting the matter in 2004.<ref name="CSB-Selk-init"/>

Investigators were unable to enter the silos themselves as OSHA ruled them to be too hazardous after the explosion. They were only able to acess the area after their eventual demolition. By the time this occured, four months after the disaster, it was believed that the explosion initiated in a basment area beneath the silos, from which sugar was fed up to the packaging building on conveyor belts.<ref name="AP-silos-demolished"/> 

It is believed that the factory's outdated construction materials and methods contributed to the severity of the blaze. The ceiling was of wooden [[tongue and groove]] design, and creosote used throughout was known as <U+201C>fat lighter<U+201D> because of the fire risk it posed.<ref name="NYT-init-overview"/>

OSHA's final report must be released by August 7, six months after the accident.<ref name="AP-silos-demolished"/>

==Aftermath==
{{Wikinews|Sugar silos at centre of Georgia, US refinery blast that killed 13 demolished}}
Imperial's refinery in Louisiana was shut down by the company six weeks after the Port Wentworth disaster over fears a similar explosion would occur there, and was not returned to operation for a week. OSHA fined Imperial [[w:United States Dollar|$]]36,000 over safety legislation violations at that plant.<ref name="rebuild"/>

The plant's 371 workers continued to receive payment from Imperial, and 275 were rehired to assist with cleanup and demolition of unsavable parts of the refinery, with work commencing on [[April 18]], [[2008]] after Imperial's board confirmed their intention to rebuild. The plan is for the plant to return to sugar refining by the end of 2008.<ref name="rebuild"/><ref name="Imp-sug-rebuild-PR">Press Release{{cite news |url=http://msnmoney.brand.edgar-online.com/EFX_dll/EDGARpro.dll?FetchFilingHTML1?ID=5872080&SessionID=otHrWta-cweD4C1|title=Imperial Sugar Board Affirms Intention to Rebuild Damaged Areas of Its Port Wentworth Refinery|date=2008-04-18 |accessdate=2008-06-22 |publisher=[[Imperial Sugar]]}}</ref> Demolition of the sugar silos was conducted on [[June 24]], [[2008]] with a [[wrecking ball]]. Demolition is set to continue from that date for a week of the area at the center of the explosion. A replacement packaging building and new sugar silos are intended to be completed by Summer 2009. During demolition {{convert|2800000|lb|kg}} of fire-hardened sugar was recovered from one silo by a crane with a bucket, and another {{convert|500000|lb|kg}} from a second. The company hopes it can be recycled for [[ethanol]] production.<ref name="AP-silos-demolished"/>

In the first quarter of 2008 Imperial posted a $15.5 million loss, which they said was primarily due to the explosion.<ref name="AP-silos-demolished"/> Port Wentworth saw an economic depression after the accident, with local businesses losing much custom that would normally be supplied by the plant's workers.<ref name="rebuild"/>

Within a month of the accident OSHA, fearing that relevant employers may be unaware their facilities presented a risk of [[dust explosion|dust explosions]], sent a letter to 30,000 employees to alert them to the danger of a similar explosion occurring. OSHA also proposed the [[Combustible Dust Explosion and Fire Prevention Act of 2008]], a new bill aimed at introducing regulations to reduce the risk of dust explosions.<ref name="OSHA-Act-08"/> In March 2008 Raquel Islas, a female worker whose arms were burnt, sued Svannah company Stokes Cntracting, who had a contract to clean the factory. In April 2008 the widow of Shelathia Harvey also sued Stokes, as well as Savannah Foods, who remained a wholly owned subsiduary after Imperial bought them out and in whose name the factory was still owned.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2008/05/03/apsugarsuit_0504.html?cxntlid=inform_sr|title=Widow files lawsuit in refinery explosion|date=2008-04-05 |accessdate=2008-06-27 |publisher=''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]''}}</ref>
