The '''Rocky Mountains''', often called the '''Rockies''', are a broad [[mountain range]] in western [[North America]]. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than 4,800 [[kilometre|kilometers]] (3,000 [[mile]]s) from northernmost [[British Columbia]], in [[Canada]], to [[New Mexico]], in the [[United States]]. The range's highest peak is [[Colorado]]'s [[Mount Elbert]] at 14,440 feet (4,401 [[metre|meters]]) above [[sea level]]. Though part of North America's [[Pacific Cordillera]], the Rockies are not to be confused with the [[Pacific Coast Ranges]] which are located immediately adjacent to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific coast]].

The Eastern edge of the rockies rises impressively above the [[Interior Plains]] of central North America, including the [[Front Range]] which runs from northern [[New Mexico]] to northern [[Colorado]], the [[Wind River Range]] and [[Big Horn Mountains]] of [[Wyoming]], the [[Crazy Mountains]] and the [[Rocky Mountain Front]] of [[Montana]], and the [[Clark Range (Canada)|Clark Range]] of [[Alberta]], along with a series of ranges in Canada called the [[Continental Ranges]]. [[Mount Robson]] in [[British Columbia]], at 3,954 meters (12,972 ft) is the highest peak in the [[Canadian Rockies]].  

The western edge of the Rockies, such as the [[Wasatch Range]] near [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] divides the [[Great Basin]] from other mountains further to the west. The Rockies do not extend into the [[Yukon]] or [[Alaska]], or into central British Columbia. The [[Geography of the United States Rocky Mountain System|'''Rocky Mountain System''']] within the United States is a [[United States physiographic region]]. <!--this paragraph should give equal time to BC/AB and also ID--> 

==Geography and geology==

{{See also|Geography of the United States Rocky Mountain System|Geology of the Rocky Mountains}}

The Rocky Mountains are commonly allowed to stretch from the [[Liard River]] in British Columbia south to the [[Rio Grande]] in New Mexico. Other mountain ranges continue beyond those two rivers, including the [[Selwyn Range (Canada)|Selwyn Range]] in [[Yukon]], the [[Brooks Range]] in [[Alaska]], and the [[Sierra Madre]] in [[Mexico]], but those are not part of the Rockies, though they are part of the [[American cordillera]].  The United States definition of the Rockies, however, includes the [[Cabinet Mountains|Cabinet]] and [[Salish Mountains]] of Idaho and Montana, whereas their counterparts north of the [[Kootenai River]], the [[Columbia Mountains]], are considered a separate system in Canada, lying to the west of the huge [[Rocky Mountain Trench]], which runs the length of British Columbia from its beginnings in the middle Flathead River valley in western Montana.

The younger ranges of the Rocky Mountains uplifted during the late [[Cretaceous]] period (100 million-65 million years ago), although some portions of the southern mountains date from uplifts during the [[Precambrian]] (3,980 million-600 million years ago). The mountains' geology is a complex of [[igneous rock|igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]; younger [[sedimentary rock]] occurs along the margins of the southern Rocky Mountains, and volcanic rock from the [[Tertiary]] (65 million-1.8 million years ago) occurs in the [[San Juan Mountains]] and in other areas. Millennia of severe erosion in the [[Wyoming Basin]] transformed intermountain basins into a relatively flat terrain. The [[Tetons]] and other north-central ranges contain folded and faulted rocks of [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]] age draped above cores of [[Proterozoic]] and [[Archean]] igneous and metamorphic rocks ranging in age from 1.2 billion (e.g., Tetons) to more than 3.3 billion years ([[Beartooth Mountains]]).<ref name="USGS">{{cite book|url=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/wm146.htm|chapter=Rocky Mountains|title=Status and Trends of the Nation's Biological Resources|author=Stohlgren, T.J.|editor=M.J.

Periods of glaciation occurred from the [[Pleistocene]] Epoch (1.8 million-70,000 years ago) to the [[Holocene]] Epoch (fewer than 11,000 years ago). Recent episodes included the [[Bull Lake Glaciation]] that began about 150,000 years ago and the [[Pinedale Glaciation]] that probably remained at full glaciation until 15,000-20,000 years ago.<ref name="USGS" /><ref name="Pierce79">{{cite book|last=Pierce|first=K.

The [[Continental Divide]] is located in the Rocky Mountains and designates the line at which waters flow either to the [[Atlantic]] or [[Pacific]] Oceans. [[Triple Divide Peak (Montana)|Triple Divide Peak]] (8,020 feet / 2,444 m) in [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)]] is so named due to the fact that water which falls on the mountain reaches not only the Atlantic and Pacific, but the [[Arctic]] Ocean as well.

== Human history ==

Since the last great Ice Age, the Rocky Mountains were home first to [[Paleo-Indians]] and then to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes of the [[Apache]], [[Arapaho]], [[Bannock (tribe)|Bannock]], [[Blackfoot]], [[Cheyenne]], [[Crow]], [[Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation|Flathead]], [[Shoshone|Shoshoni]], [[Lakota people|Sioux]], [[Ute Tribe|Ute]], [[Kutenai]] (Ktunaxa in Canada), [[Sekani]], [[Dunne-za]]  and others.<ref name="USGS" /><ref name="Johnson94">{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=M. G.|year=1994|title=The native tribes of North America: a concise encyclopedia|publisher=Macmillian Publishing|location=New York|pages=1-210}}</ref> Paleo-Indians hunted the now-extinct [[mammoth]] and [[ancient bison]] (an animal 20% larger than modern bison) in the foothills and valleys of the mountains. Like the modern tribes that followed them, Paleo-Indians probably migrated to the plains in fall and winter for bison and to the mountains in spring and summer for [[fish]], [[deer]], [[elk]], [[root]]s, and [[berry|berries]]. In Colorado, along the crest of the Continental Divide, rock walls that Native Americans built for driving game date back 5,400-5,800 years.<ref name="USGS" /><ref name="Buchholtz83">{{cite book|last=Buchholtz|first=C.

Recent human history of the Rocky Mountains is one of more rapid change.<ref name="USGS" /><ref name="Lavender75">{{cite book|last=Lavender|first=D.|year=1975|title=The Rockies|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York|pages=1-433}}</ref><ref name="Knight94" />The Spanish explorer [[Francisco V<U+00E1>squez de Coronado]] <U+2014> with a group of soldiers, missionaries, and African slaves <U+2014> marched into the Rocky Mountain region from the south in 1540. The introduction of the horse, metal tools, rifles, new diseases, and different cultures profoundly changed the Native American cultures. Native American populations were extirpated from most of their historical ranges by disease, warfare, habitat loss (eradication of the bison), and continued assaults on their culture.<ref name="USGS" />

[[Image:Rockies USA1.jpg|thumb|300px|Colorado Rockies]]
In 1739, [[France|French]] [[fur trade]]rs Pierre and Paul Mallet, while journeying through the [[Great Plains]], discovered a range of mountains at the headwaters of the [[Platte River]], which local [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribes called the "Rockies", becoming the first Europeans to report on this uncharted mountain range<ref>http://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/events/1650_1800.htm</ref>.  

[[Alexander MacKenzie|Sir Alexander MacKenzie]] (1764 - [[March 11]], [[1820]]) became the first European to cross the Rocky Mountains in 1793. He found the upper reaches of the Fraser River and reached what is now the Pacific coast of Canada on [[July 20]] of that year, completing the first recorded transcontinental crossing of North America north of Mexico. He arrived at Bella Coola, British Columbia, where he first reached saltwater at South Bentinck Arm, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean. 

The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] (1804-1806) was the first scientific reconnaissance of the Rocky Mountains. Specimens were collected for contemporary botanists, zoologists, and geologists.<ref name="USGS" /><ref name="Jackson62">{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=D.|year=1962|title=Letters of the Lewis and Clark expedition with related documents|id=1783<U+00AD>1854|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana|pages=1-728}}</ref> The expedition was said to have paved the way to (and through) the Rocky Mountains for European-Americans from the East, although Lewis and Clark met at least 11 European-American mountain men during their travels.<ref name="USGS" /> 

Mountain men, primarily French, Spanish, and British roamed the Rocky Mountains from 1720 to 1800 seeking mineral deposits and furs.<!--"mountain men" seems US-language here; were these what Canadians think of as "voyageurs" and "fur traders"?--> The fur-trading [[Northwest Company]] established [[Rocky Mountain House]] as a trading post in what is now the Rocky Mountain foothills of Alberta in 1799, and their business rivals the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] established Acton House nearby. These posts served as bases for most European activity in the Canadian Rockies in the early 1800s, most notably the expeditions of [[David Thompson (explorer)]], the first European to follow the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean. After 1802, American [[fur trader]]s and explorers ushered in the first widespread [[caucasian|caucasian]] presence in the Rockies south of the 49th parallel. The more famous of these include Americans included [[William Henry Ashley]], [[Jim Bridger]], [[Kit Carson]], [[John Colter]], [[Thomas Fitzpatrick]], [[Andrew Henry (fur trader)|Andrew Henry]], and [[Jedediah Smith]]. On [[July 24]], [[1832]], [[Benjamin Bonneville]] led the first [[wagon train]] across the Rocky Mountains by using [[Wyoming]]'s South Pass.<ref name="USGS" />
     
Thousands passed through the Rocky Mountains on the [[Oregon Trail]] beginning in 1842.  The [[Mormon]]s began to settle near the [[Great Salt Lake]] in 1847. From 1859 to 1864, [[Gold]] was discovered in [[Colorado]], [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], and [[British Columbia]] sparking several [[gold rush]]es bringing thousands of prospectors and minors to explore every mountain and canyon and to create the Rocky Mountain's first major industry.  The Idaho gold rush alone produced more gold than the California and Alaska gold rushes combined and was important in the financing of the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].  The [[transcontinental railroad]] was completed in 1869, and [[Yellowstone National Park]] was established as the world's first national park in 1872. While settlers filled the valleys and mining towns, conservation and preservation ethics began to take hold. [[Benjamin Harrison|President Harrison]] established several forest reserves in the Rocky Mountains in 1891-1892. In 1905, [[Theodore Roosevelt|President Theodore Roosevelt]] extended the [[Medicine Bow Forest Reserve]] to include the area now managed as [[Rocky Mountain National Park]].<ref name="USGS" />.<ref name="Buchholtz83" /> Economic development began to center on [[mining]], [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], and [[recreation]], as well as on the service industries that support them.<ref name="USGS" />.<ref name="Lavender75" /> Tents and camps became ranches and farms, forts and train stations became towns, and some towns became cities.<ref name="USGS" />

== Industry and development ==

Economic resources of the Rocky Mountains are varied and abundant. [[Mineral]]s found in the Rocky Mountains include significant deposits of [[copper]], [[gold]], [[lead]], [[molybdenum]], [[silver]], [[tungsten]], and [[zinc]]. The Wyoming Basin and several smaller areas contain significant reserves of [[coal]], [[natural gas]], [[oil shale]], and [[petroleum]]. For example, the [[Climax, Colorado|Climax]] mine, located near [[Leadville, Colorado]], was the largest producer of [[Molybdenum]] in the world.  Molybdenum is used in heat-resistant steel in such things as cars and planes.  The Climax mine employed over 3,000 workers.  The [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho|Coeur d<U+2019>Alene]] mine of northern Idaho produces silver, lead, and zinc.  Canada's largest [[coal]] mines are near [[Fernie, British Columbia]] and [[Sparwood, British Columbia]]; additional coal mines exist near [[Hinton, Alberta]]<ref name="USGS" /> and in the [[Northern Rocky Mountains|Northern Rockies]] surrounding [[Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia]].
[[Image:Rig wind river.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A [[Drilling rig]] drills for [[Natural Gas]] just west of the [[Wind River Range]] in the [[Wyoming]] Rockies]]
Abandoned mines with their wakes of mine tailings and toxic wastes dot the Rocky Mountain landscape. In one major example, eighty years of zinc mining profoundly polluted the river and bank near [[Eagle River (Colorado)|Eagle River]] in north-central Colorado. High concentrations of the metal carried by spring runoff harmed [[algae]], [[moss]], and [[trout]] populations. An economic analysis of mining effects at this site revealed declining property values, degraded water quality, and the loss of recreational opportunities. The analysis also revealed that cleanup of the river could yield $2.3 million in additional revenue from recreation. In 1983, the former owner of the zinc mine was sued by the Colorado Attorney General for the $4.8 million cleanup costs; 5 years later, ecological recovery was considerable.<ref name="USGS" /><ref name="Brandt93">{{cite journal|last=Brandt|first=E.|year=1993|title=How much is a gray wolf worth?|journal=National Wildlife|volume=31|pages=4<U+00AD>12}}</ref>

Agriculture and forestry are major industries. Agriculture includes dryland and irrigated farming and [[livestock]] grazing. Livestock are frequently moved between high-elevation summer [[pasture]]s and low-elevation winter pastures,<ref name="USGS" /> a practice known as [[transhumance]].

Human population is not very dense in the Rocky Mountains, with an average of four people per square kilometer (10 per square mile) and few cities with over 50,000 people. However, the human population grew rapidly in the Rocky Mountain states between 1950 and 1990. The 40-year statewide increases in population range from 35% in Montana to about 150% in Utah and Colorado. The populations of several mountain towns and communities have doubled in the last 40 years. [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming]], increased 260%, from 1,244 to 4,472 residents, in 40 years.<ref name="USGS" />

==Climate==
[[Image:Rocky Mountains.aerial view.no snow.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the Colorado Rocky Mountains in summer]]
[[Image:Aerial Section of Snow Covered Rocky Mountain at Colorado.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the Colorado Rocky Mountains in winter]]

The Rocky Mountains have a highland climate. The average annual temperature in the valley bottoms of the Colorado Rockies near the latitude of  Boulder is 43 <U+00B0>F (6 <U+00B0>C).  July is the hottest month there with an average temperature of 82 <U+00B0>F (28 <U+00B0>C). In January, the average monthly temperature is 7 <U+00B0>F (&minus;14 <U+00B0>C), making it the region's coldest month. The average precipitation per year there is approximately 14 inches (360 mm).

The summers in this area of the Rockies are warm and dry, because the western fronts impede the advancing of water-carrying storm systems.  The average temperature in summer is 59 <U+00B0>F (15 <U+00B0>C) and the average precipitation is 5.9 inches (150 mm). Winter is usually wet and very cold, with an average temperature of 28 <U+00B0>F (&minus;2 <U+00B0>C) and average snowfall of 11.4 inches (29.0 cm). In spring, the average temperature is 40 <U+00B0>F (4 <U+00B0>C) and the average precipitation is 4.2 inches (107 mm).  And in the fall, the average precipitation is 2.6 inches (66 mm) and the average temperature is 44 <U+00B0>F (7 <U+00B0>C).
