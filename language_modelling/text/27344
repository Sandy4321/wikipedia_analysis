'''Johann Joseph Vilsmayr''' (1663 &ndash; 11 July 1722) was an [[Austria]]n [[violin]]ist and [[composer]]. From 1 September 1689 he worked at [[Salzburg]]'s Hofkapelle, where he almost certainly became a pupil of [[Heinrich Ignaz Biber]], one of the best contemporary European violinists. Judging from the regular increases of his salary, Vilsmayr must have quickly attained a good reputation at the court. He kept the Salzburg position until his death on 11 July 1722.

Vilsmayr's only surviving music is a collection published in Salzburg in 1715, titled ''Artificiosus Concentus pro Camera''. It contains six [[partita]]s ''<U+00E0> Violino Solo Con Basso bell<U+00E8> imitate''&mdash;a description that, until recently, was taken as "for solo violin and basso continuo". The bass part was presumed to be lost, however, scholar Pauline H. Nobes has recently demonstrated that the partitas were probably meant for violin solo, and ''Con Basso bell<U+00E8> imitate'' may refer to the [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] texture of the works.<ref>Letzbor, Gunar.
