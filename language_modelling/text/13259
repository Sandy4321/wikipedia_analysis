'''Erin Carmody''' (born 1988) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[curling|curler]] from [[Prince Edward Island]]. A native of the town of Summerside, Carmody was a biology student at the University of Prince Edward Island when she broke onto the curling scene by winning three consecutive provincial junior championships, twice with an undefeated record. She entered the national scene in 2010 after forming a rink with longtime teammate Geri-Lynn Ramsay and veteran curlers Kathy O'Rourke and Trisha Affleck that captured the 2010 provincial championships at the senior level. At the [[2010 Scotties Tournament of Hearts]], the squad made it all the way to the final, but lost in the last match to three-time tournament champion Jennifer Jones. After the event, Carmody was presented with the [[Sandra Schmirler Most Valuable Player Award]].

==Competitive career==

===2003-2007===
One of Carmody's earliest curling victories came in 2003, while skipping out of the [[Silver Fox Curling and Yacht Club]], when she won the Prince Edward Island provincial 15 and under championship alongside [[Geri-Lynn Ramsay]], Candace Cameron, and Courtney Champion.<ref name="Under15">{{Cite news|last = M|first = Derek|title = 15, 13, 11 and Under Ch'ships wrap up at Ch'town|publisher = PEIcurling.com|date = March 20, 2003|url = http://peicurling.com/cgi-bin/newspro/viewnews.pl?newsall|accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref> Later that year she and Ramsay were members of the Vanessa Aylward rink that won the junior women's Eastern Canadian Junior [[Cashspiel]].<ref name="EJCashpiel">{{Cite news|last = M|first = Derek|title = PEI rinks win Bass River/Howard Johnson Junior Cashspiel |publisher = PEIcurling.com|date = November 23, 2003|url = http://peicurling.com/cgi-bin/newspro/viewnews.pl?newsall|accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref> The following year, with Ramsay and new additions Anita Casey and Danielle Chaisson, Carmody's rink captured the provincial 17 and under championships,<ref name="Under1704">{{Cite news|last = M|first = Derek|title = VanOuwerkerk and Carmody Capture 17 and Under Crowns|publisher = PEIcurling.com|date = February 8, 2004|url = http://peicurling.com/cgi-bin/newspro/viewnews.pl?newsall|accessdate = 2010-02-11}}</ref> a feat that Carmody and Ramsay repeated as members of the Danielle Sharkey rink in 2005.

===2007-2009===
Carmody made her breakthrough in 2007 when her rink, consisting of herself as skip, Lisa Moerike as second, Ramsay as third, and Jessica van Ouwerkerk as lead stone (a lineup that had participated in several cashpiels the previous year), captured the 2007 provincial junior curling championships with a perfect 7-0 record.<ref name="FirstJunior">{{Cite news|last = M|first = Derek|title = Brett Gallant wins third Jr. Men's title; Erin Carmody goes undefeated to take Jr. Women's crown|publisher = PEIcurling.com|date = January 14, 2007|url = http://peicurling.com/cgi-bin/newspro/viewnews.pl?newsall|accessdate = 2010-02-10}}</ref> They then advanced to the [[2007 Canadian Junior Curling Championships]], where they finished eighth out of thirteen teams.<ref name="Results">{{Cite web|title = Canadian Junior Curling Championships|work = Women's Placements|publisher = Curling Almanac|year = 2008|url = http://www.curlingalmanac.com/cjcc.php|accessdate = 2010-02-10}}</ref> The squad took the provincial junior championships for a second time in 2008 and repeated their feat of a perfect record,<ref name="SecondJunior">{{Cite news|last = Simmonds|first = Jason|title = Carmody defends title in impressive fashion|newspaper = The Journal Pioneer|location = Summerside, Prince Edward Island|publisher = [[Transcontinental (publisher)|Transcontinental Media]]|date = 2008-01-06|url = http://www.journalpioneer.com/index.cfm?sid=95368&sc=118|accessdate = 2010-02-10}}</ref> before placing ninth out of thirteen at the [[2008 Canadian Junior Curling Championships]].<ref name="Results"/> Later that year the rink took the 2008 Codiac Curling Maritime Junior Bonspiel in the Under-21 category.<ref name="Codiac">{{Cite news|title = Junior bonspiel hands out titles|newspaper = Times & Transcript|location = [[New Brunswick]]|pages = B3|publisher = CanadaEast Interactive|date = 2008-10-20|url = http://timestranscript.canadaeast.com/sports/article/453841|accessdate = 2010-02-10}}</ref> In 2009 Moerike was replaced with Darcee Birch, but Carmody's rink won the provincial junior championship for the third consecutive time.<ref name="ThirdJunior">{{Cite news|title = Erin Carmody joins Brett Gallant as repeat Pepsi Juniors winner|publisher = PEIcurling.com|date = January 7, 2009|url = http://peicurling.com/pages/2009/01/07/erin-carmody-joins-brett-gallant-as-repeat-pepsi-juniors-winner/|accessdate = 2010-02-10}}</ref> The squad had their best national finish at the [[2009 Canadian Junior Curling Championships]] when they placed fourth, narrowly missing a spot in the semifinals.<ref name="Results"/>

===2009-2011===
In 2009 Carmody and Ramsay received a call from veteran curlers [[Kathy O'Rourke]] and [[Tricia Affleck]], who decided to join forces with the younger players under a team skipped by O'Rourke, but with Carmody throwing the skip rocks and O'Rourke throwing second. Ramsay would throw third and Affleck would take the lead position. The squad found quick success by winning the [[2010 Prince Edward Island Scotties Tournament of Hearts]], which earned them the right to represent [[Prince Edward Island]] at the [[2010 Scotties Tournament of Hearts]].<ref name="Orourke">{{Cite news|last = Simmonds|first = Jason|title = O'Rourke headed to sixth Scotties after putting retirement on hold|newspaper = The Journal Pioneer|location = Summerside, Prince Edward Island|publisher = [[Transcontinental (publisher)|Transcontinental Media]]|date = 2010-01-29|url = http://www.journalpioneer.com/index.cfm?sid=322408&sc=119|accessdate = 2010-02-10}}</ref> There they finished 8-3 in the round robin and eventually advanced to the final,<ref name="Robin">{{Cite news|last = Simmonds|first = Jason|title = <U+2018>Feeling pretty good<U+2019>|newspaper = The Guardian|location = [[Charlottetown]]|publisher = [[Transcontinental (publisher)|Transcontinental Media]]|date = 2010-02-09|url = http://www.theguardian.pe.ca/index.cfm?sid=325317&sc=99|accessdate = 2010-02-10}}</ref> where they lost against [[Jennifer Jones (curler)|Jennifer Jones]], who represented Team Canada as the competition's previous winner. Despite the loss, however, Carmody received the [[Sandra Schmirler]] Award as the tournament's [[Most Valuable Player]].<ref name="MVP">{{Cite news|last = Simmonds|first = Jason|title = Carmody presented with Sandra Schmirler award|newspaper = The Journal Pioneer|location = Summerside, Prince Edward Island|publisher = [[Transcontinental (publisher)|Transcontinental Media]]|date = 2010-02-09|url = http://www.journalpioneer.com/index.cfm?sid=325262&sc=119|accessdate = 2010-02-10}}</ref>

===Since 2011===
For the 2011-2012 curling season Carmody, along with [[Geri-Lynn Ramsay]], will play with Calgary skip [[Crystal Webster]]. Carmody will be attending the [[University of Calgary]] and Ramsay decided to make the move to Calgary when her boyfriend was offered a new job opportunity. Webster was looking for new teammates, as her third [[Lori Olson-Johns]] switiched rinks to curl with [[Cheryl Bernard]].<ref name="Tankard"/>
