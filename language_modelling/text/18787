==Plot==
After going to the doctor, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], along with his wife, [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], begin to return home. As they reach their car in the parking lot, actor [[Ryan Reynolds]] drives by them, and asks for directions. As he leaves, he indicates his enjoyment of Peter's presence. The next day, when Peter exits his home, he notices that Ryan has moved into the house formerly occupied by neighbor [[Cleveland Brown]] across the street. Peter then asks Ryan what he is doing in [[Family Guy#Setting|Quahog]], and he reveals that he is filming for a movie. Excited about the prospect of being neighbors, Peter attends a housewarming party for Ryan later that night. At the party, Ryan begins to tickle Peter, with Ryan requesting Peter to return the favor. Later that week, the two decide to have dinner together. While there, Ryan attempts to kiss Peter, who decides to run out of the restaurant immediately. The next day, Peter approaches Lois and tells her that he believes that Ryan is [[homosexuality|gay]]. Lois rejects the idea, causing Peter to visit Ryan and ask if he is attracted to him. Ryan tells Peter that he is not gay, and that he is only attracted to his spirit the way a man is attracted to a woman. Angered by Peter's accusation, Ryan then tells Peter to leave his home. As he leaves, however, Ryan hands him a cell phone so that the two "can stay in touch."

Meanwhile, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] goes to pick up [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] from day care. On the drive home, Stewie begins listening to the radio, and decides to stay in the car by himself to continue listening. As he begins to sing to the song, he becomes angered, and accidentally hits the stick shift, causing the car to move forward. Thinking he can now drive, Stewie decides to take the car for a drive later that day. Thrilled by the experience, he begins listening to the radio, and learns of a contest to win concert tickets to see [[Justin Bieber]]. Attempting to enter, Stewie uses his cell phone to call the radio station. As he does so, the car begins to spin out of control, and crashes into a lamp post. Stewie then returns the car home, with the entire front of the vehicle completely destroyed. Brian soon discovers the damage, and immediately blames Stewie, who tries to deny his accusation. Brian then tells him that he is going to tell Peter and Lois, to the dismay of Stewie, who begins crying. Afraid of being punished, Stewie decides to run away from home, and leaves a disc for Brian to play and learn about his plans to leave Quahog. Stewie then takes the bus to the airport, but is dropped off at the wrong neighborhood. [[List of characters in Family Guy#Consuela|Consuela]], the [[Griffin family]]'s former maid, finds him, and takes him home with her. Later, Brian is able to find Stewie, and tells him that he did not tell anyone about the incident. As the two attempt to leave Consuela's home, she insists on keeping him, to the chagrin of Stewie who steals a nearby gun, and shoots her in the foot. The two then leave, and return home.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/objects/121/121452.html |title=Stewie Goes for a Drive Family Guy |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2011-11-07}}</ref><ref name="flash">{{cite web |url=http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z4 |title=Ryan Reynolds and Peter Griffin are Just Friends on an All-New "Family Guy" |publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] |work=''Fox Flash'' |accessdate=2011-11-07}}</ref>

The episode also acquired a 3.0/7 rating in the 18<U+2013>49 demographic, beating ''Allen Gregory'' and ''American Dad'', in addition to significantly edging out both shows in total viewership.<ref name="ratings">{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/11/07/tv-ratings-sunday-once-upon-a-time-falls-but-not-far-ravens-steelers-dominates-night/109772/ |title=TV Ratings Sunday: 'Once Upon a Time' Falls, But Not Far; Ravens-Steelers Dominates Night |last=Seidman |first=Robert |accessdate=2011-11-07 |date=2011-11-07 |publisher=[[TV by the Numbers]]}}</ref> The episode's ratings decreased somewhat from the previous week's episode, "[[Screams of Silence: The Story of Brenda Q]]".<ref name="ratings2">{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/10/31/tv-ratings-sunday-once-upon-a-time-holds-up-allen-gregory-debuts-weakly/108988/ |title=TV Ratings Sunday: 'Once Upon a Time' Holds Up; 'Allen Gregory' Debuts Weakly |last=Seidman |first=Robert |accessdate=2010-10-31 |date=2010-10-31 |publisher=TV by the Numbers}}</ref>

Reviews of the episode were mostly mixed, calling the storyline a "much less extreme reversal" of the [[Family Guy (season 2)|season two]] episode "[[The Story on Page One]]", in which Peter attempts to seduce actor [[Luke Perry]].<ref name="avclub">{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/stewie-goes-for-a-drive,64546/?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=feeds&utm_source=channel_tv |title=Review: "Stewie Goes for a Drive" |publisher=The A.V. Club |accessdate=2011-11-07 |date=2011-11-06 |last=McFarland |first=Kevin}}</ref> Kevin McFarland of [[The A.V. Club]] wrote of the episode, "It was disappointing to see ''Family Guy'' bury a guest star like [[Kaitlin Olson]] in the background for much of her episode as [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]]'s sister last week, but it was even worse to see the show waste Ryan Reynolds."<ref name="avclub"/> He continued, "He may not fit an empirical definition of a movie star, but I think he<U+2019>s worth more as a guest than a tired trope like playing himself as a sexual predator towards Peter."<ref name="avclub"/> McFarland also criticized the episode's two storylines, noting, "Both plots paint themselves into a corner with no time to get out. In the third act, Stewie is trapped at Consuela's house and Peter hadn't succumbed to Reynolds' repetitive and slowly escalating advances or done anything about them, so the show snaps its fingers and ends each one prematurely."<ref name="avclub"/> He graded the episode as a C-.<ref name="avclub"/> In a much more positive review, Terron R. Moore of [[Ology]] criticized the episode for not featuring Griffin family siblings [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], but praised the series for adopting a Stewie-centric storyline.<ref name="ology">{{cite web |url=http://www.ology.com/tv/family-guy-recap-stewie-goes-drive |title='Family Guy' Recap: "Stewie Goes For A Drive" |last=Moore |first=Terron R. |accessdate=2011-11-07 |date=2011-11-06 |publisher=[[Ology]]}}</ref> Moore noted of the storyline involving Reynolds, "All pretty funny stuff, but Ryan Reynolds' entire guest slot is based on the fact that you like Ryan Reynolds and his occasionally homoerotic humor, which I can definitely appreciate."<ref name="ology"/> He concluded his review by writing, "Not the best ''Family Guy'', but a definite improvement on the week before, using some of the elements it knows best."<ref name="ology"/> Andy Neuenschwander of Yidio also gave mixed reaction to the episode, writing, "Something happens whenever a celebrity shows up on "Family Guy" and plays themselves. I can't quite put my finger on it, but everything just feels a bit off. This episode, which featured Ryan Reynolds as Ryan Reynolds, only confirmed that feeling."<ref name="yidio">{{cite web |url=http://www.yidio.com/show/family-guy/news/family-guy-season-10-episode-4-recap-stewie-goes-drive-4322 |title='Family Guy' Season 10, Episode 4 Recap - 'Stewie Goes for a Drive' |publisher=Yidio |last=Neuenschwander |first=Andy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |date=2011-11-07}}</ref> He also compared it to ''The Simpsons'', noting, "Maybe it's the way the celebrity is treated as a character: in shows like ''The Simpsons'', celebrities who play themselves appear as a relatively normal version of themselves {{interp|...}} But on ''Family Guy'', celebrities tend to appear as some bizarro version of themselves."<ref name="yidio"/>
