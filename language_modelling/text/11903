==History==
''Lysinibacillus fusiformis'' was initially isolated from the surface of [[beta vulgaris]] by [[Germans|German]] [[biologist]] Dr. O. Gottheil in 1901.<ref name=Botanische>"Botanische Beschreibung Einiger Bodenbakterien." Internet Archive. Illinois, 1901. Web. 30 Apr. 2014.</ref> Dr. Gottheil used a variety of [[isolation (health care)|isolation]] techniques, which included [[cultivating]] the [[organism]] on [[carrot]] and [[beet]] slices.<ref name="Botanische"/> ''L. fusiformis'' was originally known as ''Bacillus fusiformis'' prior to 2007; at which point it was reclassified to the [[genus]] ''[[Lysinibacillus]]'', along with its close [[Kinship|relative]] ''Bacillus sphaericus''.<ref name=Ahmed>Ahmed, Iftikhar et al. "Proposal of Lysinibacillus Boronitolerans Gen. Nov. Sp. Nov., and Transfer of Bacillus Fusiformis to Lysinibacillus Fusiformis Comb. Nov. and Bacillus Sphaericus to Lysinibacillus Sphaericus Comb. Nov." IJSEM. International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology, May 2007. Web. 29 Apr. 2014.</ref> The [[taxonomic classification]] of the [[organism]] was reassigned as a result of ''L. fusiformis''' distinctive characteristics, such as [[physiology]], [[phylogeny]], and [[peptidoglycan]] composition.

===Etymology===
The meaning of "lysini," as it pertains to members of the [[genus]] ''[[Lysinibacillus]]'', signifies the presence of [[lysine]], [[alanine]], [[glutamic acid]], and [[aspartic acid]] in the [[peptidoglycan]] layer of the [[cell wall]].<ref name="Ahmed"/> <U+201C>[[Bacillus]]<U+201D>, meaning small-rod, refers to the [[rod-shaped]] [[physiology]] of the [[bacterial]] form.<ref name="Priest"/> <U+201C>Fusum<U+201D> translates to [[spindle apparatus|spindle]] and <U+201C>forma<U+201D> denotes a particular figure, appearance, or configuration. Thus, <U+201C>fusiformis<U+201D> is derived from the bacteria<U+2019>s [[spindle apparatus|spindle]]-like [[structure]].<ref name="Priest"/>

==Morphology==
''Lysinibacillus fusiformis'' is [[gram-positive]], [[rod-shaped]], non-motile [[bacterium]].<ref name=Hendricks>David Hendricks, Paul De Vos, and William Barny Whitman. The Firmicutes. 2nd ed. Vol. 3. Dordrecht: Springer, 2009. Print.</ref> Active [[cells]] have an approximate [[length]] of 2.5-3.0 [[micrometers]] and an approximate [[width]] of 0.5-0.9 [[micrometers]].<ref name=He>He, M et al. "Characterization and Genomic Analysis of a Highly Chromate Resistant and Reducing Bacterial Strain Lysinibacillus Fusiformis ZC1." National Center for Biotechnology Information. U.S. National Library of Medicine, 30 Jan. 2011. Web. 29 Apr. 2014.</ref> Under strenuous conditions, this [[microbe]] can generate inactive [[spherical]] [[endospores]] that are resistant to high [[temperatures]], damaging [[chemicals]], and [[ultraviolet light]].<ref name="Hendricks"/> The developing [[endospores]] localize either centrally or terminally within the enlarged [[sporangia]] and can remain functional for long periods of [[time]].<ref name="Hendricks"/>

==Ecology==
''Lysinibacillus fusiformis'' is a naturally occurring [[bacterium]] and various [[strain (biology)|strain]]s have been isolated from multiple [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]s including [[farming]] [[soil]] and [[factory]] [[wastewater]].<ref name="Botanische"/><ref name="He"/> This [[organism]] is considered to be altogether [[mesophilic]]; growing best at a [[temperature]] range of 17-37 degrees [[Celsius]].<ref name="Hendricks"/> ''L. fusiformis'' is also considered to be mildly [[alkaliphilic]] and moderately [[halophilic]]; growing best at a [[pH]] range of 6-9.5 and an [[NaCl]] concentration of 2-7%.<ref name="Hendricks"/>

===Pathogenicity===
In the 20th Century, ''Lysinibacillus fusiformis'' was believed to cause a form of [[pathogenicity]] in [[humans]] relating to [[tropical ulcer]] formations and [[dermal]] and/or [[respiratory]] [[infections]].<ref name="Smith"/> Some [[researchers]] believed that ''L. fusiformis'' [[infections]] could only occur as a [[symbiotic]] relationship with certain [[spirochaete]] [[species]].<ref name="Peters"/> Multiple [[experiments]] to prove the existence of [[pathogenicity]] have turned up inconclusive<ref name="Smith"/><ref name="Peters"/> In 2010, researchers identified a [[strain (biology)|strain]] of ''L. fusiformis'', ''B-1'', from [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]] [[gene]] analysis.<ref name=Wang>Wang, Jun, Yanhui Fan, and Zhigang Yao. "Isolation of a Lysinibacillus Fusiformis Strain with Tetrodotoxin-producing Ability from Puffer Fish Fugu Obscurus and the Characterization of This Strain." ScienceDirect. Elservier, 15 Sept. 2010. Web. 29 Apr. 2014.</ref> This strain has been found exclusively in the [[toxin]] of the [[puffer fish]], ''[[Takifugu]] obscurus''.<ref name="Wang"/> This [[toxin]] is a [[tetrodotoxin]], which is a highly [[Death|fatal]] [[neurotoxin]] that destroys the [[central nervous system]] of [[humans]] causing [[paralysis]].<ref name="Wang"/> ''L. fusiformis'' is shown to be sensitive to the common [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] known as [[tetracycline]].<ref name="Priest"/>

==Metabolism==
''Lysinibacillus fusiformis'' tests positive for [[oxidase]] and is an [[obligate aerobe]].<ref name="Hendricks"/> This means that it can utilize [[oxygen]] to metabolize various [[sugars]] and other simple [[carbohydrates]].<ref name="Hendricks"/> However, it does not metabolize [[polysaccharides]] such as [[starch]].<ref name="Hendricks"/> This [[organism]] does not produce [[acid]] or [[gas]] from the [[metabolism]] of [[D-glucose]] or any other [[carbohydrates]] and does not reduce [[nitrate]] to [[nitrite]].<ref name="Hendricks"/> ''L. fusiformis'' can hydrolyze [[casein]] and [[gelatin]].<ref name="Hendricks"/> It can also utilize [[acetate]], [[citrate]], [[formate]], [[lactic acid|lactate]], and [[succinate]] as [[carbon]] sources.<ref name="Hendricks"/> From a metabolic standpoint, ''L. fusiformis'' and ''[[Lysinibacillus sphaericus]]'' are nearly identical.<ref name="Priest"/> As of now, the only known factor that distinguishes these two [[species]] is that ''L. fusiformis'' is positive for [[urease]].<ref name="Priest"/> This means that ''L. fusiformis'' can [[hydrolyze]] [[urea]] to produce [[ammonia]] and [[CO2]].<ref name=Brink>Brink, Benita. "Urease Test Protocol." ASM MicrobeLibrary. American Society For Microbiology, 11 Nov. 2011. Web. 29 Apr. 2014.</ref> In 2011, the [[strain (biology)|strain]] ''L. fusiformis ZC1'' was shown to retain the ability to reduce [[chromate]] to [[chromium]].<ref name="He"/>

==Genomics==
As of 2014, there are a couple partial [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]] [[gene]] sequences (GenBank No. AF169537 and EU430993) that have been analyzed for ''L. fusiformis'' and several whole [[genome sequences]] of various strains.<ref name="Lysinibacillus"/><ref name=Nakamura>Nakamura, L. K. "Phylogeny of Bacillus Sphaericus-Like Organisms." International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology 50 (2000): 1715-722. Web.</ref> There are multiple ongoing [[genome sequencing]] projects involving this [[organism]].<ref name="Lysinibacillus"/> Currently, these genomic sequences exist as scaffolds and include the following strains: ''Lysinibacillus fusiformis H1K'', ''Lysinibacillus fusiformis ZB2'', and ''Lysinibacillus fusiformis ZC1''.<ref name="Lysinibacillus"/> According to the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]], ''L. fusiformis ZC1'' (BioProject: PRJNA226204) is the current genomic representative for ''L. fusiformis''.<ref name="Lysinibacillus"/> The ''L. fusiformis ZC1'' [[genome]] was sequenced using the whole [[genome]] [[shotgun sequencing]] method.<ref name="He"/> Genomic analysis of strain ZC1 shows a [[genome]] with an approximate [[length]] of 4.65 [[megabases]] that contains 4,729 [[protein]]-coding [[genes]] and maintains a relatively moderate [[GC content]] (mol%) of 37.3%.<ref name="He"/> The [[gene]] chrA was found in ''L. fusiformis'' and encodes a [[chromate]] Cr(VI) [[Membrane transport protein|transporter]] that confirms [[chromate]] Cr(VI) [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]].<ref name="He"/>

==Applications to science and medicine==
The mechanism of ''L. fusiformis<U+2019>'' [[pathogenicity]] is not well understood by [[microbiologists]]. [[Chromium]] is an important [[Chemical element|element]] used in the [[manufacturing]] of many [[product (business)|product]]s such as [[leather tanning]], [[alloy]] production, and [[electroplating]].<ref name="He"/> For many [[countries]], [[factory]] [[waste]] contamination of [[soil]] waters is an ever-growing problem in the [[modern history|modern]] [[industry|industrial]] [[society]]. [[Chromate]] Cr(VI) [[contamination]] of [[soil]] waters can cause [[chromium toxicity]] in many [[biological systems]] that utilize or come into contact with this [[waste]].<ref name="He"/> Conventional methods for the [[detoxification]] of [[soil]] waters are not [[cost effective]] and can cause subsequent [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]al [[pollution]].<ref name="He"/> ''L. fusiformis ZC1'' has the ability to reduce [[toxic]] [[hexavalent chromium]] Cr(VI) to less-[[toxic]] trivalent [[chromium]] Cr(III).<ref name="He"/> This ability makes it a [[candidate]] for the [[detoxification]] of [[factory]] wastewaters.<ref name="He"/>
