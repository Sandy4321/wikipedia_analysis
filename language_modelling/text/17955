==History==
[[File:Big Cranes Mitsubishi.jpg|thumb|right|The Big Cranes at The Mitsubishi Dockyard Nagasaki, Meiji Period]]
In 1857, at the request of the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]], a group of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] engineers began work on the ''Nagasaki Yotetsusho'', a modern, Western-style [[foundry]] and shipyard near the Dutch settlement of [[Dejima]], at [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]].<ref name="nsmw_history">{{cite web|url=http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/nsmw/introduction/history/index.html|author=Nagasaki Shipyard & Machinery Works|title=History|accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref> This was renamed ''Nagasaki Seitetsusho'' in 1860, and construction was completed in 1861. Following the [[Meiji restoration]] of 1868, the shipyard was placed under control of the new [[Meiji government]]. The first dry dock was completed in 1879.

In 1884 [[Yataro Iwasaki]], the founder of Mitsubishi, leased the ''Nagasaki [[Ironworks|Seitetsusho]]'' from the Japanese government, renaming it the ''Nagasaki Shipyard & Machinery Works'' and entering the shipbuilding business on a large scale. Iwasaki purchased the shipyards outright in 1887. In 1891, '''Mitsubishi Heavy Industries - Yokohama Machinery Works''' was started as ''Yokohama Dock Company, Ltd''. Its main business was ship repairs, to which it added ship servicing by 1897.<ref name="ymw_outline">{{cite web|url=http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/ydmw/introduction/outline/index.html|author=Yokohama Machinery Works|title=Outline|accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref> The works was renamed ''Mitsubishi Shipyard of Mitsubishi [[G<U+014D>shi gaisha|Goshi Kaisha]]'' in 1893 and additional [[dry dock]]s were completed in 1896 and 1905.<ref name="nsmw_history" />

The '''Mitsubishi Heavy Industries - Shimonoseki Shipyard & Machinery Works''' was established in 1914. It produced industrial machinery and merchant ships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/ssmw/introduction/outline/index.html|author=Shimonoseki Shipyard & Machinery Works|title=Outline|accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref>

The Nagasaki company was renamed ''Mitsubishi Shipbuilding & Engineering Company, Ltd''. in 1917 and again renamed as ''Mitsubishi Heavy Industries'' in 1934. It became the largest private firm in Japan, active in the manufacture of ships, heavy machinery, airplanes and railroad cars. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries merged with the Yokohama Dock Company in 1935.<ref name="ymw_outline" /> From its inception, the Mitsubishi Nagasaki shipyards were heavily involved in contracts for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. The [[battleship]] [[Japanese battleship Musashi|Musashi]] was completed at Nagasaki in 1942.

The ''Kobe Shipyard of Mitsubishi Goshi Kaisha'' was established in 1905. The Kobe Shipyard merged with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in 1934. The Kobe Shipyard constructed the ocean liner Argentina Maru (later repurposed as the [[aircraft carrier]] [[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaiyo|Kaiyo]]), the submarine [[Japanese submarine I-19|I-19]] and the [[Japanese submarine I-25|I-25]].<ref name="ksmw_history">{{cite web|url=http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/kobe/introduction/history/briefhistory/index.html|author=Kobe Shipyard & Machinery Works|title=Brief History|accessdate=2011-03-02}}</ref>

Following the dissolution of the ''[[zaibatsu]]'' after the [[surrender of Japan]] at the end of [[World War II]], Mitsubishi divided into three companies. Mitsubishi Nagasaki became ''West Japan Heavy Industries, Ltd.,'' The Nagasaki Shipyard was renamed ''Mitsubishi Shipbuilding & Engineering Co., Ltd''. in 1952.<ref name="nsmw_history" /> The Mitsubishi Kobe Shipyard became ''Central Japan Heavy Industries,Ltd.'' in 1950.<ref name="ksmw_history" />

In 1964, the three independent companies from the 1950 break-up, were merged again into one company under the name of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. The Nagasaki works was renamed the ''Nagasaki Shipyard & Engine Works''. The Kobe works was remamed the '''Mitsubishi Heavy Industries - Kobe Shipyard & Machinery Works'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/kobe/introduction/outline/index.html|author=Kobe Shipyard & Machinery Works|title=Outline|accessdate=2011-02-28}}</ref>

In 1970, MHI's automobile parts department became an independent company as [[Mitsubishi Motors]].

MHI participated in a <U+00A5>540 billion emergency rescue of Mitsubishi Motors in January 2005, in partnership with [[Mitsubishi Corporation]] and [[Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group]].<ref name=nyt29105>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/28/business/worldbusiness/28iht-mitsu.html|title=Mitsubishi's rocky road|accessdate=17 July 2012|publisher=The New York Times| date=29 January 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4214655.stm|title=Mitsubishi seeks $5.2bn bail out |accessdate=17 July 2012|publisher=BBC News| date=28 January 2005}}</ref> As part of the rescue MHI acquired <U+00A5>50 billion of Mitsubishi Motors stock, increasing its ownership stake to 15 percent and making the automaker an affiliate again.<ref name=nyt29105/>
