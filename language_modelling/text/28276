The '''TNA X Division Championship''' is a [[professional wrestling]] [[World Heavyweight Championship (professional wrestling)|world]] [[championship (professional wrestling)|championship]] owned and copyrighted by [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA). It is currently tied with the [[TNA Legends Championship]] for second highest ranked championship in TNA, behind the [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]]. It is primarily defend in TNA's [[X Division]]&ndash;a division based on fast paced, high flying style of wrestling. It was created and debuted on June 19, 2002 at the [[broadcast delay|taping]] of TNA's second [[TNA Weekly PPV|weekly pay-per-view]] (PPV) [[List of TNA pay-per-view events|event]], where [[A.J. Styles]] was crowned the inaugural champion.<ref name="reign1"/>

Being a professional wrestling championship, title reigns are not won legitimately, instead are won via a scripted ending to a match or being awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline. There have been a total of 38 reigns among 19 different wrestlers. The belt has had three different names and two different designs during its entire existence. The title was referred to as the NWA X Championship, the NWA&ndash;TNA X Championship, and the NWA&ndash;TNA X Division Championship from the title's creation to mid-2004.<ref name="reign1"/>

The TNA X Division Championship was the first championship of its kind, making way for an entire new division in professional wrestling. When the championship was created, TNA were still apart of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA), as a result, several [[List of National Wrestling Alliance territories|subsidiaries]] of the NWA created their own [[:Category:X Division championships|X Division Championship]]. TNA considers the X Division Championship to be a world championship, not to be confused with a world "heavyweight" championship; this was made clear at their [[TNA Unbreakable|Unbreakable]] PPV event in September 2005.<ref name="worldX">{{cite episode|title=Total Nonstop Action Wrestling presents: TNA Unbreakable|series=TNA Unbreakable|serieslink=TNA Unbreakable|network=[[In Demand]]|airdate=2005-09-11|quote=This match was billed as being for the TNA X Division Championship of the World.}}</ref>

==History==
===X Division===
{{main|X Division}}
The TNA [[X Division]] is described as wrestling reinvented, as it takes traditional wrestling and mixes it with the fast paced, high-risk style of wrestling incorporated in [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|cruiserweight divisions]] and [[lucha libre]]. Unlike most [[professional wrestling promotions]], TNA decided not to name this division a cruiserweight division, seeing as most wrestlers who wrestle this style weigh under {{convert|220|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, the limit for most cruiserweight divisions. They instead wanted to emphasize a change in tradition. To show this change, the division's motto is ''"It is not about weight limits, it is about no limits"''. Since its creation in June 2002, the division has become a mainstay in the promotion, with multiple wrestlers from the division main eventing ''Impact!'' episodes, weekly PPV events, and monthly PPV events. Several wrestlers from the division have went on to compete in TNA's heavyweight division. [[A.J. Styles]], [[Samoa Joe]], and [[Jay Lethal]] are a few who have either won the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA]] or [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]] or competed for either championship.{{ref|1}}

===Creation and pivotal moments===

===Belt designs===
[[File:X Title compared.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The current design [top] and the previous design [bottom] of the TNA X Division Championship compared]]
The X Division Championship has had two designed during is existence. The first belt began with a black leather strap. Two metal plates were then placed at each end of the belt, with a larger plate at the very middle. Each plate had a sliver laying with gold outlining. The center plate had an enlarged red letter "X" directly in the center. An NWA&ndash;TNA logo with red lining was incorporated at the top of the belt with the word "Title" at the very bottom of the belt directly below the red letter "X" in black print. The second design was introduced in May 2007 after the NWA ended their five-year partnership with TNA.<ref name="end of NWA-TNA">{{cite web|url=http://revver.com/video/267425/nwatmtrobich-strips-tnacageteam-3-d-of-nwatm-branded-championships/|title=NWA<U+2122>/Trobich strips TNA/Cage/Team 3D of NWA<U+2122> branded Championships|accessdate=2009-04-15|publisher=[[National Wrestling Alliance]]}}</ref> The new and current design of the championship was introduced on May 16, 2007 on TNA's online podcast [[TNA Today]].<ref name="newbelt (X)">{{cite video|date2=15|month2=05|year2=2007|title=The 5/16 "TNA Today" - New X Title Revealed!|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frvIaUVPN6I&feature=player_embedded|publisher=[[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]|accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref> The title has a sliver base with gold outlining, just like the previous design, however also has a gold outlaying over the belt.

The NWA&ndash;TNA logo was removed and instead replaced with the then-current TNA logo in red letters. The previous smaller plates were re-designed to hold a sliver, gold, and red TNA logo on them. The entire design was then mounted onto a black leather belt, like the previous design.{{ref|2}}
