== Biography ==
Michael Levitt was born in Pretoria, South Africa, to a [[Jewish]] family from [[Plung<U+0117>]], [[Lithuania]].<ref>[http://en.delfi.lt/53464/foreign-minister-congratulates-litvak-levitt-on-winning-nobel-prize-201353464/ Foreign Minister congratulates Litvak Levitt on winning Nobel Prize]</ref> He attended Sunnyside Primary School, and Pretoria Boys High School between 1960 and 1962. The family moved to England when he was 15.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/world/.premium-1.551801 Nobel laureate Michael Levitt tells Haaretz: 'I still feel 16, so I have no ego<U+2019>]</ref> Levitt spent 1963 studying mathematics, physics and chemistry at the [[University of Pretoria]].<ref>http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=8641&ArticleID=18621</ref> He attended [[King's College London]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Physics]] in 1967.<ref name="whoswho"/><ref>http://csb.stanford.edu/levitt/2_Page_CV.html Michael Levitt CV</ref>

At the age of 21 he moved to Israel and served in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. Together with his Israeli wife, Rina, a sculptor, he left to study at Cambridge, where his three children were born. In 1979, he returned to Israel and taught at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] in [[Rehovot]]. In 1986, he began teaching at Stanford, and since then has split his time between Israel and California.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/world/.premium-1.551801 Nobel laureate Michael Levitt tells Haaretz: 'I still feel 16, so I have no ego<U+2019>]</ref>

Levitt holds American, British and Israeli citizenship (he is the 6th Israeli to win the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in under a decade).<ref>[http://www.timesofisrael.com/tiny-israel-a-nobel-heavyweight-especially-in-chemistry/ Tiny Israel a Nobel heavyweight, especially in chemistry]</ref><ref>[http://www.timesofisrael.com/two-americans-german-win-nobel-medicine-prize/] By Haviv Rettig Gur, 9 October 2013, ''Times of Israel''</ref>

Levitt spends half the year in Israel, where his wife and children live.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/world/1.551446 Two Israeli scientists who emigrated to U.S. win Nobel Prize in Chemistry] Haaretz, by Ido Efrati, 9 October 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4438751,00.html Nobel laureate: I didn't get tenure in Israel] Yitzhak Benhorin, Washington, [[Ynet]], 9 October 2013</ref>

==Academic career==
Levitt was a PhD student in [[Computational Biology]] at [[Peterhouse]], [[Cambridge]], and was based at the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] from 1968 to 1972, where he developed a computer programme for studying the conformations of molecules that underpinned much of his later work.<ref name="levittphd">{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Michael|last=Levitt |title=Conformation analysis of proteins |publisher=University of Cambridge |date=1972 |url=http://ulmss-newton.lib.cam.ac.uk/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=10796|authorlink=Michael Levitt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Nobel Prize in Chemistry for Peterhouse alumnus|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/news/nobel-prize-in-chemistry-for-peterhouse-alumnus|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref> In 1967, he was sent on behalf of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Cambridge University, to [[Israel]], to work at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], with Professor [http://www.weizmann.ac.il/chemphys/lifson/home.html Shneior Lifson]  and a student of his <U+2013> [[Arieh Warshel]], of the [[Technion]] in Haifa. They were using computer modelling to understand the behaviour of biological molecules.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24458534 Computer chemists win Nobel prize] By James Morgan and Jonathan Amos, BBC News, 9 October 2013</ref>

He went on to gain a research fellowship at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]].

From 1980 to 1987, he was Professor of Chemical Physics at [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], Israel. Thereafter, he has served as Professor of Structural biology, at [[Stanford University]], California.

==Research==
Levitt was one of the first researchers to conduct [[molecular dynamics]] simulations of DNA and proteins and developed the first [[software]] for this purpose.<ref>{{cite pmid|2687698}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|934293}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|985660}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|957439}}</ref> He is currently well known for developing approaches to predict macromolecular structures, having participated in many [[CASP|Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP)]] competitions,<ref>{{cite pmid|20589633}}</ref> where he criticized molecular dynamics for inability to refine protein structures.<ref name="Koehl">CASP participants usually did not try to use MD to avoid "a central embarrassment of molecular mechanics, namely that energy minimization or molecular dynamics generally leads to a model that is less like the experimental structure", Koehl P. and Michael Levitt (1999).
