According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the population is 29,377.  The city is named in honor of [[Patrick Cleburne]], a Confederate General.

== History ==
[[File:Main Street, Cleburne, TX, 1910s cph.3b18657.jpg|thumb|left|Main Street in Cleburne in the 1910s]]
Cleburne is Johnson County's third county seat. It was formerly known as Camp Henderson, a temporary Civil War outpost from which Johnson County soldiers would depart for war (most of them would serve under General Cleburne). The city was formally incorporated in 1871.

In August 1886 the Texas [[Farmers' Alliance]] met at Lee's Academy <ref name="HBTO">{{cite web

| title=The Handbook of Texas Online: Johnson County
| accessdate=2012-01-28
| publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}</ref> and adopted a seventeen point political resolution, commonly known as the Cleburne Demands, which was the first major document of the agrarian revolt occurring at the end of the late nineteenth century.<ref name="moment">{{Citation | title = The Populist Moment: A Short History of the Agrarian Revolt in America | last = Goodwyn | first = Lawrence | year = 1978 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | ISBN = 0-19-502417-6}}, p.46-49.</ref>

Cleburne was primarily an agricultural center and county seat until the Santa Fe Railroad opened a major facility there in 1898. During this time the population boomed, as it became a sizable city for the area with over 12,000 residents by 1920.

In 1985, the city was the petitioner in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.]]'' after being sued over a  [[special-use permit]].

Cleburne is on the fringe of the Dallas-Fort Worth [[Metroplex]].  Growth in the area can be primarily attributed to suburbanization. It is the second most populous city in Johnson County (slightly less populous than [[Burleson, Texas|Burleson]]).<ref>North Central Texas Council of Governments</ref>
