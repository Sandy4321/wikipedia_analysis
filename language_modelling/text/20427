'''Harbhajan Singh''' {{audio|Harbhajan_Singh.ogg|pronunciation}} ({{lang-pa|<U+0A39><U+0A30><U+0A2D><U+0A1C><U+0A28> <U+0A38><U+0A3F><U+0A70><U+0A18>}}, born: [[3 July]], [[1980]] in [[Jalandhar]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[India]]) is an [[Indian cricket team|Indian]] [[cricket]]er and India's most successful [[off spin]] [[bowling (cricket)|bowler]].

Harbhajan made his [[Test cricket|Test]] and [[One-day International]] (ODI) debuts in early 1998.  His career was initially beset by investigations into the [[Laws of Cricket|legality]] of his bowling action and disciplinary incidents that raised the ire of cricket authorities. However in 2001, with leading [[leg spin|leg spinner]] [[Anil Kumble]] injured, Harbhajan's career was resuscitated after [[Indian national cricket captains|Indian captain]] [[Sourav Ganguly]] called for his inclusion in the [[Border-Gavaskar Trophy]] team. In that series victory over [[Australian cricket team|Australia]], Harbhajan established himself as the team's leading spinner by taking 32 [[wicket]]s  and becoming the first Indian bowler to take a [[hat trick]] in Test cricket.<ref name="profile">{{cite web| first = Sambit| last= Bal|  title = Players and officials: Harbhajan Singh| url= http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/29264.html| publisher =[[Cricinfo]]| accessdate = 2007-02-27}}</ref>

A finger injury in mid 2003 sidelined him for much of the following year, allowing Kumble to regain his position as the first choice [[spin bowling|spinner]]. Harbhajan reclaimed a regular position in the team upon his return in late 2004, but often found himself watching from the sidelines in Test matches outside the [[Indian subcontinent]] with typically only one spinner, Kumble, being used. Despite unremarkable Test performances in 2006, which led to speculation about his lack of loop and his waning value as a strike bowler, he remains India's first-choice ODI spinner. 

== Early years and personal life ==
Harbhajan was born into a [[middle class]] [[Punjabi]] family, the only son of businessman Sardar Sardev Singh, who owned a [[ball bearing]] and [[valve]] factory.<ref name="bbcfire">{{cite news| title= The renaissance of Harbhajan| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/1638947.stm| date = [[2001-11-05]] | accessdate= 2007-02-12| publisher = [[BBC]]}}</ref><ref name="rediff">{{cite web| title=Bhajji and his papa's dream| url=http://clients.rediff.com/philipseyefi/bhaji.htm| publisher = [[Rediff]] | accessdate = 2007-02-28}}</ref> Growing up with five sisters, he was in line to inherit the family business, but his father insisted that he concentrate on his cricket career and represent India.<ref name="rediff"/>

Harbhajan was trained as a [[batsman]] by his first coach Charanjit Singh Bullar, but converted to spin bowling after his coach's untimely death saw him turn to the tutelage of Davinder Arora. Arora credits Harbhajan's success to a work ethic that included a three hour training session in the morning, followed by another in the afternoon lasting from 3pm until after sunset, using the headlights of a parked scooter to provide light.<ref name="rediff"/>

Following the death of his father in 2000, Harbhajan became the family head, and as of 2001, had organised marriages for three of his sisters.<ref name="bbcfire"/> In 2002, he ruled out his own marriage until at least 2008.<ref>{{cite news| title= I'll eat anything| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/224663.html|publisher =[[Cricinfo]] | date =[[2002]]| accessdate = 2007-03-02}}</ref> In 2005, he again fended off marriage rumours linking him to a [[Bangalore]] based bride, stating that he would only make a decision "after a couple of years", and that he would be seeking a [[Punjabi]] bride selected by his family.<ref>{{cite news| title= Harbhajan denies marriage reports| url=http://www.chennaionline.com/cricket/Features/2005/01news12.asp|publisher =Chennai Online | date =[[2005-01-06]]| accessdate = 2007-03-02}}</ref>

In a country where cricketers are idolised, Harbhajan's performances have brought him government accolades and lucrative sponsorships. Following his performance against [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] in 2001, the [[Government of Punjab]] awarded him [[Indian rupee|Rs.]] 5 [[lakh]], a plot of land, and an offer to become an honorary Deputy Superintendent of Punjab Police, which he declined.<ref name="bbcfire"/> Harbhajan is also an employee of [[Indian Airlines]], for whom he does promotions.<ref>{{cite news| title= DSP post offered to Harbhajan| url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/95597.html|publisher =[[Cricinfo]] | date =[[2001-04-26]]| accessdate = 2007-02-28}}</ref>

Somewhat ironically, after being offered an honorary post with the police, Harbhajan sustained minor injuries in March 2002 in an altercation with police outside the team hotel in [[Guwahati]]. The scuffle broke out when Harbhajan remonstrated with police officers after they refused to allow a photographer into the hotel.  Harbhajan was struck by the police, cutting his bowling arm and injuring his elbow.  Extensive negotiations from local officials and organisers were required to dissuade Harbhajan and captain [[Sourav Ganguly]] from leaving the area after Ganguly said that the Indian team would abandon the scheduled match against [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]].<ref name="cops"/>

[[Image:Harbhajan hair.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Harbhajan as he appeared in the Royal Stag advertisement.]]
One of his common nicknames, outside India, is ''The Turbanator'', deriving from his skill as a bowler in terminating the innings of the opposing team, and the fact that, as a [[Sikh]], he wears a black [[turban]] whenever he plays.<ref>{{cite news| first=Chloe |last=Saltau |title="I'll be back," says the Turbanator| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/09/1070732211286.html?from=storyrhs |publisher = [[The Age]] | date=[[2003-12-10]]| accessdate=2007-03-01}}</ref> Among Indians, Harbhajan is more commonly known as ''bhajji''.<!--meaning? language?--><!-- HarBHAJan--><ref name="rediff"/> It was estimated in 2005 that Harbhajan was the most recognised and commercially viable Indian cricketer after [[Sachin Tendulkar]], in part due to his colourful personality and iconic turban, as well as his reputation for enjoying the celebrity social scene.<ref name="es"/> His signing for English [[county cricket|county team]] [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] in 2005, based at [[The Oval]] in [[London]], was partly attributed to his marketability. Harbhajan had generated a large personal following in the western London suburb of [[Southall]], which boasts a majority Punjabi Sikh population, when he lived there in 1998 whilst training under [[Fred Titmus]].<ref name="es">{{cite news|first=Vivek| last=Chaudhary| title=Bank on Turbanator| url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4153/is_20050308/ai_n12411451| publisher = [[Evening Standard]] |date=[[2005-03-25]] |accessdate=2007-03-02}}</ref>

In 2006, Harbhajan's endorsements generated controversy when he appeared without his [[Turban (Sikhism)|turban]] in an advertisement for Royal Stag [[whisky]]. This angered many orthodox Sikhs, leading to anti-Harbhajan protests in the Sikh holy city of [[Amritsar]], with [[effigy|effigies]] of Harbhajan being burnt.<ref>{{cite news| title= Strictures for Harbhajan over commercial|url= http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/261738.html| publisher = [[Cricinfo]]|accessdate = 2007-02-07| date = [[2006-10-07]]}}</ref> The Sikh clergy and [[Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee]] (SGPC) demanded an apology from him and asked Seagram's to withdraw the advert, on the basis that it had "hurt the feelings of Sikhs". Harbhajan quickly issued an apology, but he was also unhappy at the clergy's interference, stating "If they were unhappy, they should have called me and talked to me like a son".<ref>{{cite news

== Early career ==
Harbhajan made his [[first-class cricket]] debut in late 1997, during the 1997/98 [[Ranji Trophy]] season for [[Punjab cricket team]]. Playing in six matches, he took 18 wickets at an [[bowling average|average]] of 22.5, ranking outside the top 20 in both wicket taking and averages.<ref>{{cite web| title= Bowling - Most Wickets| url= http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1997-98/IND_LOCAL/RANJI/STATS/IND_LOCAL_RANJI_AVS_BOWL_MOST_WKTS.html |accessdate=2007-01-17 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> He played in only one [[Duleep Trophy]] match for [[North Zone cricket team|North Zone]], in which he took 5/131.<ref>{{cite web| title= East Zone v North Zone at Hyderabad, Dec 1-5, 1997| url= http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1997-98/IND_LOCAL/DULEEP/EAST_NORTH_DULEEP_01-05DEC1997.html |accessdate=2007-01-17 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> Despite many bowlers having superior domestic performances, Harbhajan was selected to make his Test debut in the [[Australian cricket team in India in 1997-98|Third Test against Australia]] in [[Bangalore]], where he recorded the modest match figures of 2/136.<ref>{{cite news| title= 3rd Test:India v Australia at Bangalore, Mar 25-28, 1998| url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/engine/match/63796.html |accessdate=2007-01-15 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> He was subsequently overlooked for the ODI tournament that followed the Tests, involving [[Zimbabwe cricket team|Zimbabwe]] in addition to Austrlaian, but was selected for all group matches in the triangular tournament that followed soon after in [[Sharjah]], where he made his ODI debut against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]].<ref name ="odilist">{{cite web| title= Statsguru - Harbhajan Singh - ODIs - Innings by innings list|url=  http://statserver.cricket.org/guru?sdb=player;playerid=7139;class=odiplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1998-03-25;start=1998-03-25;enddefault=2006-07-02;end=2006-07-02;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_list;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |accessdate=2007-01-17 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> Harbhajan was fined and reprimanded by the [[Panel of ICC Referees|match referee]] in his first international series, when his on-field behaviour was adjudged to breach the [[ICC Code of Conduct]], following an altercation with [[Ricky Ponting]] after Ponting was dismissed by Harbhajan.<ref name = "bbcfire"/><ref>{{cite web|title=  1998: Penalties imposed on players for breaches of ICC Code of Conduct| url= http://www.icc-cricket.com/icc/rules/penalties/1998.html|publisher = [[International Cricket Council]]| accessdate = 2007-01-30}}</ref> 

Harbhajan was then omitted from the team during a home triangular ODI tournament against [[Bangladesh cricket team|Bangladesh]] and [[Kenyan cricket team|Kenya]], but was recalled for the [[Singer Trophy]] in [[Sri Lanka]], claiming eight wickets at an average of 24.1. After again being omitted for the [[Sahara Cup]] series against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] in [[Toronto]], Harbhajan took five wickets at an average of 22.6 on a [[Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 1998-99|tour to Zimbabwe]], in what would proved to be his last ODI appearances for India for more than two years.<ref name ="odiseries">{{cite web| title= Statsguru - Harbhajan Singh - ODIs - Series averages|url= http://statserver.cricket.org/guru?sdb=player;playerid=7139;class=odiplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1998-04-17;start=1998-04-17;enddefault=2006-12-03;end=2006-12-03;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_series;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |accessdate=2007-01-17 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> In all, he took 18 wickets at an average of 27.2 during the calendar year<!--1998?-->.<ref name ="odicareer">{{cite web| title= Statsguru - Harbhajan Singh - ODIs - Career summary|url= http://statserver.cricket.org/guru?sdb=player;playerid=7139;class=odiplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1998-04-17;start=1998-04-17;enddefault=2006-12-03;end=2006-12-03;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_summary;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |accessdate=2007-01-17 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> 

Harbhajan was retained in the Test team, taking 5/106 in the only Test on the Zimbabwe tour. However, his opportunities were limited in the 1998/99 season, playing in five of the seven Tests after being omitted for matches against New Zealand and Pakistan respectively. <ref name ="testlist">{{cite web| title= Statsguru - Harbhajan Singh - Tests - Innings by innings list|url=  http://statserver.cricket.org/guru?sdb=player;playerid=7139;class=testplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1998-03-25;start=1998-03-25;enddefault=2006-07-02;end=2006-07-02;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_list;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |accessdate=2007-01-17 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref><ref name ="testseries">{{cite web| title= Statsguru - Harbhajan Singh - Tests - Series averages|url= http://statserver.cricket.org/guru?sdb=player;playerid=7139;class=testplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1998-04-17;start=1998-04-17;enddefault=2006-12-03;end=2006-12-03;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_series;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |accessdate=2007-01-17 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> In all, he claimed 13 wickets at an average of 36.8.<ref name="testsum"/> When he was free of international fixtures for the season, he played in the Ranji Trophy matches, claiming 27 wickets at an average of 24.59 in five matches, including his first five-wicket haul at first-class level.<ref>{{cite web| title= Bowling - Most Wickets| url= http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1998-99/IND_LOCAL/RANJI/STATS/IND_LOCAL_RANJI_AVS_BOWL_MOST_WKTS.html |accessdate=2007-01-17 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> Harbhajan was overlooked for the ODI team for the whole season and missed selection for the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]].<ref name="odilist"/><ref>{{cite web|title= India Squad for 1999 World Cup| url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/WORLD_CUPS/WC99/SQUADS/WC99_IND-SQUAD.html| publisher=[[Cricinfo]]| accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref> He managed to retain his Test position for the [[New Zealand cricket team in India in 1999-2000|late 1999 home series against New Zealand]], as India fielded a three pronged spin attack <!--Kumble and ...?--> on dusty tracks, taking six wickets at an average of 32.66.<ref>{{cite web| title =New Zealand in India, 1999/00 Test Series Averages| url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1999-2000/NZ_IN_IND/STATS/NZ_IN_IND_SEP-NOV1999_TEST_AVS.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref>

Harbhajan [[Indian cricket team in Australia in 1999-2000|toured Australia in 1999/2000]], as the second spinner.

In mid-2000, an opportunity arose when Harbhajan was selected in the first group of trainees sent to the [[National Cricket Academy]] to study under [[Erapalli Prasanna]] and [[Srinivas Venkataraghavan]], two off spin bowlers from the [[Indian spin quartet]] of the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news|first = Partab| last = Ramchand| title= First list of NCA trainees| url = http://feedsuk.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/CRICKET_NEWS/2000/APR/029816_CI_15APR2000.html| publisher = [[Cricinfo]]| date = [[2000-04-15]]| accessdate = 2007-02-08}}</ref> However, his behaviour did not conform to requirements, and he was expelled on disciplinary grounds by director [[Hanumant Singh]].<ref>{{cite news|first = Partab| last = Ramchand| title= Three players offloaded from National Cricket Academy| url =http://feedsuk.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/CRICKET_NEWS/2000/JUN/038509_CI_20JUN2000.html| publisher = [[Cricinfo]]| date = [[2000-06-20]]| accessdate = 2007-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first =Woorkheri| last = Raman| title = Harbhajan has overcome problems and succeeded| url= http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/103827.html| publisher=[[Cricinfo]]| date = [[2001-06-29]]| accessdate = 2007-02-07}}</ref> His sponsorship job with [[Indian Airlines]] was also reviewed as a result of his indiscipline.<ref name = "bbcfire"/><ref>{{cite news|first= Anand| last= Vasu| title= Harbhajan Singh:Succeeding in trying circumstances| url= http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/105432.html| publisher = [[Cricinfo]]| date =[[2001-03-23]]| accessdate =2007-02-07}}</ref> Harbhajan later admitted that he had been at fault earlier in his career.<ref>{{cite news| first= Rahul| last = Bhattacharya| title = I'll eat anything|url= http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/224663.html| date = [[January 2002]]| accessdate = 2007-02-07}}</ref>

Following his run-ins with Indian cricket administrators, there was nothing to indicate that Harbhajan's chances of national selection had improved at the start of 2000/01. Despite Kumble being injured, Harbhajan was again overlooked as Kartik, [[Sunil Joshi]], and debutant [[Sarandeep Singh]] were entrusted with the spin bowling duties in Test matches against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe on the subcontinent.<ref>{{cite web| title =India in Bangladesh, 2000/01 Test Match Averages | url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2000-01/IND_IN_BDESH/IND_IN_BDESH_NOV2000_TEST_AVS.html| publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Zimbabwe in India, 2000/01 Test Series Averages| url=http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2000-01/ZIM_IN_IND/STATS/ZIM_IN_IND_NOV-DEC2000_TEST_AVS.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref> Having made little success in this phase of his international career, averaging 37.75 per wicket, and seemingly out of favour with selectors, Harbhajan faced a difficult decision.<ref name="testsum"/> His father had recently died; as the family's only son, Harbhajan was now obliged to support his mother and unmarried sisters.

== 2001 Border-Gavaskar Trophy ==

With Kumble injured during the home series in March 2001 against the visiting Australians, Harbhajan, whose previous best Test figures were only 3/30, was entrusted with a heavy burden. He was to lead the spin attack against an Australian team which had set a world record with 15 consecutive Test victories, and was searching for its first ever series victory on Indian soil [[Australian cricket team in India in 1969-70|since 1969]].

== Later career ==
Harbhajan's Test success saw him recalled to the ODI team after more than two years. He was unable to reproduce his Test form against Australia, managing only four wickets at an average of 59.25, and a cameo batting performance of 46 runs from 34 balls, including three sixes. He was dropped from the ODI team during a subsequent triangular tournament in [[Zimbabwe]] in 2001 after only managing two wickets at 69.<ref name="odiseries"/> Harbhajan was also unable to maintain his form in the [[Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2001|Test series]], taking eight wickets at 29.1 in the series against Zimbabwe, but did manage to post his first Test half-century, reaching 66 in the First Test in [[Bulawayo]].<ref name="testseries"/> The Indians subsequently [[Indian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2001|toured Sri Lanka]] in mid-2001, enjoying spinning wickets similar to those in India. Harbhajan managed to establish himself in the ODI team with eleven wickets at 21, but his Test form deteriorated further, yielding only four wickets at 73, while Sri Lankan spinner [[Muttiah Muralitharan]] was named man of the series with 23 at 19, in what was billed as a contest between the world's two leading off-spinners.<ref name="bbcfire"/> Harbhajan was omitted from the Indian team in favour of Kumble on the following [[Indian cricket team in South Africa in 2001-02|tour of South Africa]], only playing in the later matches when India fielded two spinners. Nevertheless, Harbhajan continued to average 20 in the ODI format, winning his first man of the match award in the ODI form in an ODI against South Africa in [[Bloemfontein]].<ref name="odiseries"/><ref name="testseries"/> His disciplinary problems continued when he was one of four Indian players fined and given a suspended one match suspension for dissent and attempting to intimidate the umpire by over-appealing.<ref>{{cite web|title=  2001: Penalties imposed on players for breaches of ICC Code of Conduct| url= http://www.icc-cricket.com/icc/rules/penalties/2001.html|publisher = [[International Cricket Council]]| accessdate = 2007-01-30}}</ref>

Harbhajan's Test fortunes improved immediately upon the start of the 2001/02 international season in India. Playing in his first international match at his home ground in [[Mohali]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], Harbhajan took match figures of 7/110, including 5/51 in the first innings, to help India win the First Test by ten wickets against the [[English cricket team in India in 2001-02|touring English team]].

Harbhajan was under pressure to perform when [[Sri Lankan cricket team in India in 2005-06|Sri Lanka toured India]] in late 2005 following his attack on Chappell and the replacement of Ganguly, who had frequently supported him during previous career difficulties, with new captain [[Rahul Dravid]].
