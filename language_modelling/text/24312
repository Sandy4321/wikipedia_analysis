The '''Big 12 Conference''' is a [[list of college athletic conferences|college athletic conference]] of twelve schools located mostly in the central United States, with headquarters located just outside of [[Dallas]], in [[Irving, Texas]]. It is a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] for all sports; its [[American football|football]] teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS; formerly Division I-A), the higher of two levels of NCAA Division I football competition.  Member schools are located in <!--COLORADO DOES NOT BEGIN PAC 10 PLAY UNTIL JULY 1, 2012, DO NOT REMOVE COLORADO FROM THIS PAGE UNTIL THEN-->[[Colorado]], [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Missouri]], <!--NEBRASKA DOES NOT BEGIN BIG TEN PLAY UNTIL JULY 1, 2011, DO NOT REMOVE NEBRASKA FROM THIS PAGE UNTIL THEN-->[[Nebraska]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Texas]].  Because some perceive the conference to revolve around The University of Texas, the conference has been referred to by some fans and media as "The Big Texas Conference".<ref>http://www.omaha.com/article/20100614/SPORTS/706149841</ref>  <ref>http://www.silverandbluesports.com/forum/showthread.php?t=2819</ref>

The conference was officially formed on February 25, 1994, when the members of the former [[Big Eight Conference]] joined with four Texas schools that had been members of the [[Southwest Conference]], which had just disbanded.<ref>http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/MYSA081405_3N_SWCbaylor_tech_1ca3e1c_html8528.html</ref> The Big 12 Conference considers itself a new conference, as opposed to an evolution of the Big Eight Conference, and does not claim the Big Eight Conference's history as its own.  Athletic competition in the conference commenced on August 31, 1996. 

The conference is split into two divisions for most major sports.  The Oklahoma and Texas schools make up the South Division, and the other former [[Big Eight Conference]] teams make up the North Division.  Due to the announced departures of Nebraska after 2010, and Colorado after 2011, the divisions will be re-consolidated into one conference of ten schools if the Big 12 Conference continues without adding any new members.<ref name=BigTen>{{cite web|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EXPANSION_NEBRASKA?SITE=TNMEM&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |title=Nebraska joins Big Ten |author=Eric Olson |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=June 11, 2010 |accessdate=June 11, 2010}}</ref><ref name=movetopac10>{{cite web|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/060610/red_649630073.shtml|title=Move to PAC-10 a possibility|publisher=''Lubbock Avalanche-Journal'' (Lubbock, Texas)|author=Linehan, Courtney|date=2010-06-06|accessdate=2010-06-11|pages=B1-B2}}</ref>

According to the Big 12 Conference's website, the use of the alternate names "Big Twelve" and "Big XII" are incorrect; the trademarked name of the conference is "Big 12 Conference" (notwithstanding the Roman numeral XII featured on the conference logo).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.big12sports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10410&KEY=&ATCLID=1514841|title=The Big 12 Conference - Outstanding Success|publisher=Big 12 Conference|accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref>

===Conference realignment===
{{main|2010 NCAA conference realignment}}
In June 2010 American intercollegiate sports news became rife with speculation that the Big 12 Conference was on the verge of dissolution, including rumors of dividing the teams largely between the [[Pacific 10 Conference|Pac 10]] and [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] conferences.  On June 10, the University of Colorado accepted an invitation to become the Pac 10's eleventh member, effective in 2012.<ref>[http://www.pac-10.org/genrel/061010aaa.html University of Colorado Joins Pac-10]</ref><ref>[http://ozarksfirst.com/fulltext?nxd_id=279955]</ref>  The following day (June 11) the University of Nebraska applied for, and was unanimously accepted to join the Big Ten conference, becoming the Big Ten's twelfth member, effective in 2011.<ref name=BigTen></ref>  According to multiple sources, the loss of Nebraska would set into motion the collapse of the Big 12.  <ref name=movetopac10></ref>  However, on June 14, Texas, Texas Tech, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, and Texas A&M officially declined the Pac-10 invitation in order to stay in the Big 12.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=5286672]</ref> A&M officials had also been unsuccessful in lobbying for invitation to the Southeastern Conference.<ref>http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/bohls/entries/2010/06/12/am_doesnt_have.html?cxntfid=blogs_bohl_games</ref> On June 16th, Texas State lawmakers Garnet Coleman and Bill Callegari, both from the Houston area, co-wrote a letter asking Big 12 officials to consider adding the [[University of Houston]] to the conference.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/football/ncaa/06/17/houston-big12.ap/index.html Texas lawmakers pushing Big 12 to consider adding Houston.]</ref>

The Big 12 Conference distributes revenue, mostly collected from television contracts, [[bowl game]]s, the [[NCAA]], merchandise, licensing, and conference-hosted sporting events, annually to member institutions.<ref name="espnrevenue">{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/big12/post/_/id/2094/how-the-big-12-teams-rank-in-revenue-sharing-funds |title=How the Big 12 teams rank in revenue-sharing funds  |publisher=[[ESPN]] |author=Griffin, Tim |date=2009-05-26 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref> One-half of all distributed revenue is allotted equally; the rest is distributed based upon the number of television appearances.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/colleges/topstories/stories/060610dnspobig12sider2.112db5e.html |title=Big 12 problems trace to league's roots |publisher=''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' |author=Kerkhoff, Blair |date=2010-06-05 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref> Due to this revenue-sharing model, larger schools in the conference, such as the University of Texas, can receive more revenue because television channels will schedule such schools more frequently than smaller schools that may have less national audience appeal.  In 2006, for example, Texas received $10.2 million, 44% more than Baylor University's $7.1 million.

Compared to other conferences, the Big 12's revenue is low for a [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] conference; this is due in part to television contracts signed with [[Fox Sports Net]] (four years for $48 million) and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[ESPN]] (eight years for $480 million) that are set to expire in 2012 and 2016, respectively.  In comparison, the [[Southeastern Conference]] will collect nearly $3 billion total from its two 15-year contracts with [[ESPN]] and [[CBS]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2010/jun/03/tv-is-big-12s-shot-at-curbing-grazing/ |title=TV is Big 12<U+2019>s shot at curbing grazing |publisher=''[[Columbia Daily Tribune]]'' |author=Matter, Dave |date=2010-06-03 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>

{{Main|Big 12 Conference football}}
There are many national football powerhouses in the Big 12 Conference, and when the league was formed, it was decided that the top team from the South Division would play the top team from the North Division at the end of the season to determine the conference champion.

Teams play eight conference games a season, facing all five opponents within its own division and three teams from the opposite division. Inter-divisional play is a "three-on, three-off" system, where teams will play three teams from the other division on a home-and-home basis for two seasons, and then play the other three foes from the opposite side for a two-year home-and-home. 

This format has come under considerable criticism, especially from fans at Nebraska and Oklahoma, who are denied a yearly matchup between two of college football's most storied programs. The Oklahoma<U+2013>Nebraska rivalry was one of the most intense rivalries in college football history. (Until 2006, the teams had never met in the Big 12 Championship.) There has been talk of modifying the current format to allow each team to have one permanent opponent from the opposite division (as is the case in the [[Southeastern Conference]] and [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]), or for Nebraska and Oklahoma to play a non-conference game when the two teams are not scheduled to meet in conference play.

==== Championship Game ====
{{Main|Big 12 Championship Game}}

The '''[[Big 12 Championship Game]]''' is held by the Big 12 Conference each year. The championship game pits the Big 12 North Division champion against the Big 12 South Division champion in a game held after the regular season has been completed. The first championship game was held during the 1996 season. Since the 1996 season, the most football championships have been held at [[Arrowhead Stadium]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. The [[2008 Big 12 Championship Game]] was held at Arrowhead, while the 2009 game was played at [[Cowboys Stadium]] in [[Arlington, Texas]] with the Texas Longhorns defeating the Nebraska Cornhuskers 13-12.  Barring a rule change by the NCAA (conferences currently must have 12 teams to contest a Championship game) or the addition of schools to replace Nebraska or Colorado, the 2010 Big 12 Championship Game will be the final championship game for the time being.

==== Rivalries ====
The Big 12 Conference has many rivalries among its member schools, primarily in [[American football|football]]. Most of the rivalries existed before the Big 12 was established. The Kansas-Missouri rivalry is the longest running in the Big 12, being played for 118 years; however the Texas<U+2013>Oklahoma rivalry is also unique, as it too was a major rivalry decades before the two schools were in the same conference.  Some of the longstanding football rivalries between Big 12 schools include:

==== Other notable series ====
<!--NEBRASKA DOES NOT BEGIN BIG TEN PLAY UNTIL JULY 1, 2011, DO NOT REMOVE NEBRASKA FROM THIS PAGE UNTIL THEN-->
*'''Kansas v. Nebraska''' - The series began in 1892 and has been played 116 times, making it the second most-played series in the Big 12 and tied for second oldest. The series is also the longest uninterrupted series in [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]], having been played each year since 1906<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/previews/2000/11/04/nnd_kka/ Kansas at Nebraska]</ref> While longstanding, the series is not known as a rivalry due to Nebraska's dominance. Nebraska once won 36 games in a row (the [[Most consecutive wins over one opponent (NCAA football)|second most consecutive wins]] over a team in college football history) and currently leads the series 89-23-3.<ref> [http://www.huskerpedia.com/games/kansas.html Nebraska vs. Kansas] </ref>
*'''Baylor v. Texas''' - The series began in 1901 and has been played 99 times, including annually since 1946.  Although Texas maintains a dominating 73&ndash;22&ndash;4 lead in the series and holds the series' longest winning streaks of 16, 11, and 11 games, Baylor has at times been very competitive, such as from 1913 to 1942, 1951 to 1957, and 1974 to 1992.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/bay/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/09-ma-section05.pdf |title=History |work=2009 Baylor Football Media Almanac |publisher=Baylor Athletics (Baylor University) |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref>

Although standings in the conference are combined and not split among divisions, the schedule is structured as if the schools were split into two divisions. Teams play a home-and-home against teams within its division and a single game against teams from the opposite division for a total of 16 conference games. This denies Oklahoma and Oklahoma State, formerly in the Big Eight, two games a season against their opponents from that former conference, but does allow most of the other traditional rivalries to be played home-and-home.
