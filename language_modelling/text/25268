'''Tuoba Yituo''' ({{zh|c=<U+62D3><U+8DCB><U+7317><U+340C>(<U+62D6> without <U+624B>)}}; [[pinyin]]: Tu<U+00F2>b<U+00E1> Y<U+012B>tu<U+014D>) (?-305) was the chieftain of the central [[Tuoba]] territory from 295-305. He is the son of Tuoba Shamohan (<U+62D3><U+8DCB><U+6C99><U+6F20><U+6C57>) and the brother of [[Tuoba Yilu]] and [[Tuoba Fu]].

In 295, [[Tuoba Luguan]] the chieftain of the [[Tuoba]] (a branch of the [[Xianbei]]) divided the territory under Tuoba control into three areas:
in a vast tract of land extending west from White Mountain (northeast of [[Zhangjiakou]]), to Dai ([[Datong]], [[Shanxi]]); an area from Shengle (south of [[Hohhot]]) and beyond; a central area, which included north [[Shanxi]] and the region to its north. Tuoba Yituo would be named chieftain of the central area. As chieftain of the central Tuoba territory, Tuoba Yituo in 297 passes through [[Outer Mongolia]] and conquers 30 territories, gained the support of various ethnically [[Han Chinese|Han]] people, in addition to his own Xianbei people. Tuoba Yituo is said to have rescued Sima Teng, governor of the Jin province of Bing, from the Xiongnu. In 304, Tuoba Yituo, along with Tuoba Yilu, joined forces with the [[J<U+00EC>n Dynasty (265-420)|Jin]] armies and defeated [[Han Zhao]] leader [[Liu Yuan (Han Zhao)|Liu Yuan]].  In 305, Tuoba Yituo died, and was succeeded by his son [[Tuoba Pugen]] as chieftain of the central Tuoba territory.
