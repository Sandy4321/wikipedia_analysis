Like [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], a driver's license is a standard form of identification in Bangladesh. A person having a driver's license in Bangladesh can avoid carrying a collection of additional certificates to prove his identity to different government or non-government agencies.

==Penalties==
Any law enforcer including the [[Bangladesh Police|police]], [[Rapid Action Battalion]], Armed Police Battalion or [[Bangladesh Army|military personnel]] in special duties are authorized to ask for driving license if that specific driver is found to violate or being subjected to violation of any of the traffic or other laws while driving a vehicle. However only the police is authorized to seize license and other authorization documents of vehicles and then file cases against the violators if necessary.
