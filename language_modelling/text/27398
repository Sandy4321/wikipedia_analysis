'''Quintuple meter''' (Brit. '''metre''') or '''quintuple time''' (chiefly Brit.) is a musical [[meter (music)|meter]] characterized by 5 beats in a measure. Like the more common [[Duple meter|duple]], [[triple meter|triple]], and [[quadruple meter|quadruple]] meters, it may be [[Meter (music)#Simple meter|simple]], with each beat divided in half, or [[Compound meter (music)|compound]], with each beat divided into thirds. The most common [[time signature]]s for simple quintuple meter are 5/4 and 5/8, and compound quintuple meter is most often written in 15/8. A time signature of 15/8, however, does not necessarily mean that the bar is a quintuple meter with each beat divided into three. It may, for example, be used to indicate a bar of triple meter in which each beat is subdivided into five parts. In this case, the meter is sometimes characterized as "triple quintuple time".<ref>Read 1964, 152.</ref> It is also possible for a 15/8 time signature to be used for an irregular, or "[[Additive meter|additive]]" metrical pattern, such as groupings of 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 eighth notes or, for example in the ''Hymn to the Sun'' and ''Hymn to Nemesis'' by [[Mesomedes|Mesomedes of Crete]], 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2, which may alternatively be given the composite signature (8+7)/8.<ref>West 1992, 304<U+2013>307.</ref> Quintuple meter can also be notated by using regularly ''alternating'' bars of triple and duple meters, for example 2/4 + 3/4, or 6/8 + 9/8, or through the use of "compound meters", in which two or three numerals take the place of the expected numerator 5, for example, (2 + 3)/8, or (2 + 1 + 2)/8.<ref>Read 1964, 161 and 164<U+2013>65.</ref> Conversely, the presence of a 5/4 or 5/8 meter signature does not necessarily mean that the music is in quintuple meter. The regular alternation of 5/4 and 4/4 in Bruce Hornsby's "The Tango King" (from the album [[Hot House (Bruce Hornsby album)|Hot House]]), for example, results in an overall nonuple meter (5 + 4 = 9).<ref>Hornsby 1995.</ref>

==History==
Before the 20th century, quintuple time was rare in European concert music, but is more commonly found in other world cultures. 

===Ancient Greek music===
[[File:FirstDelphicHymn800.png|thumb|500px|Transcription of the opening of the First Delphic Hymn, by Athenaeus, son of Athenaeus]]
Rhythm in ancient Greek music was closely tied to poetic meter, and included what are understood today as quintuple patterns. The two [[Delphic Hymns]] from the second century BC both provide examples. The First Delphic Hymn, by [[Athenaeus (musician)|Athenaeus, son of Athenaeus]], is in the quintuple [[Cretic]] meter throughout. The first nine of the ten sections of the Second Hymn, by [[Limenius]], are also in Cretic meter.<ref>P<U+00F6>hlmann and West 2001, 70<U+2013>71 and 85.</ref> In addition to the Cretic meter, which consisted of a long-short-long pattern, ancient Greek music had seven other quintuple meters: Bacchic (L-L-S ), Palimbacchic (or antibacchic: S-L-L), four species of Paeanic (L-S-S-S, S-L-S-S, S-S-L-S<U+2014>which is a composite of [[pyrrhic]] and [[trochee]]<U+2014>and S-S-S-L), and [[hyporchema]]tic (S-S-S-S-S).<ref>Salinas 1577, 251<U+2013>53.</ref>

===Asia and the Middle East===
Arabic theorists already in the early [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] period (AD 750<U+2013>900) described [[modal rhythm]]ic cycles (''<U+012B>q<U+0101><U+2018><U+0101>t''), that included quintuple meters, though taxonomies and terminology vary amongst writers. The first figure to describe these rhythms was [[Al-Kindi|Ab<U+016B> Y<U+016B>suf Ya<U+2018>q<U+016B>b al-Kind<U+012B>]] (ca 801<U+2013>ca 866), who divided them into two broad categories, ''<U+1E6F><U+1E96>aq<U+012B>l'' ("heavy", meaning slow) and ''khaf<U+012B>f'' ("light", meaning quick). Two of his ''<U+1E6F><U+1E96>aq<U+012B>l'' modes<U+2014>''<U+1E6F><U+1E96>aq<U+012B>l th<U+0101>n<U+012B>'' ("second heavy", S-S-L-S) and ''ramal'' (L-S-L)<U+2014>and one ''khaf<U+012B>f'' mode are quintuple.<ref>Wright and Poch<U+00E9> 2001, 2 (iv).</ref> The most important writers of the later Abbasid period (AD 900<U+2013>1258) were [[Al-F<U+0101>r<U+0101>b<U+012B>|Ab<U+016B> Na<U+1E63>r al-F<U+0101>r<U+0101>b<U+012B>]] (d. 950) and [[Avicenna|Ibn S<U+012B>n<U+0101>]] (d. 1037). Al-F<U+0101>r<U+0101>b<U+012B> elaborated the rhythmic system established a century earlier by another important early-Abbasid musician, Is<U+1E25><U+0101>q al-Maw<U+1E63>il<U+012B>, who had based it on local traditions, without any knowledge of classical Greek music theory.<ref>Neubauer 2001.</ref> Is<U+1E25><U+0101>q<U+2019>s and al-F<U+0101>r<U+0101>b<U+012B>'s system consisted of eight rhythmic modes, the third and fourth of which were quintuple: called ''<U+1E6F><U+1E96>aq<U+012B>l th<U+0101>n<U+012B>'' ("second heavy"), and ''khaf<U+012B>f al-<U+1E6F><U+1E96>aq<U+012B>l th<U+0101>n<U+012B>'' ("second light heavy"), both of which are short-short-short-long, in slow and fast tempo, respectively.<ref>Sawa 2004, 164<U+2013>66.</ref> This terminology and these definitions continued to be found as late as the 12th century in [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Spain]], for example in a document by Abd-All<U+0101>h ibn Mu<U+1E25>ammad ib al-<U+1E62><U+012B>d al-Ba<U+1E6D>aliaws<U+012B>.<ref>Sawa 2004, 151<U+2013>54; Neubauer 2001.</ref>

In the Moroccon ''Mal<U+1E25><U+016B>n'' repertory<U+2014>an urban song style closely associated with [[Andalusian classical music|Andalusian music]]<U+2014>5/8 rhythms are sometimes introduced into the basic metre of 2/4.<ref>Schuyler 2001.</ref> Turkish classical music employs a system of rhythmic modes (called ''usul''), which include units ranging from two to ten time units. The five-beat meter is called ''t<U+00FC>rk aksa<U+011F><U+0131>''.<ref>Reinhard and Stokes 2001.</ref>

The cyclically repeating fixed time cycles of [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] and [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] classical music, called [[Tala (music)|t<U+0101>las]], include both fast and slow quintuple patterns, as well as binary, ternary, and septuple cycles.<ref>Powers 2001, (i).</ref> In the Carnatic system, there is a complex "formal" system of t<U+0101>las which is of great antiquity, and a more recent, rather simpler "informal" system, comprising selected t<U+0101>las from the "formal" system, plus two fast t<U+0101>las called ''C<U+0101>pu''. The slow quintuple t<U+0101>la, called ''Jhamp<U+0101>'' is from the formal system, and consists of a pattern of 7&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;2 beats; the fast quintuple t<U+0101>la is called ''kha<U+1E47><U+1E0D>a C<U+0101>pu'' or ''ara Jhamp<U+0101>'', and consists of 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;2 beats. However, the pattern of beats marking the rotation of the cycle does not necessarily indicate the internal rhythmic organization. For example, although the ''Jhamp<U+0101>'' t<U+0101>la, in its most common ''mi<U+015B>ra'' variety, is governed by 7&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;2, the most characteristic rhythm of melodies in this t<U+0101>la is (2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3) + (2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3).<ref>Powers 2001, (iii).</ref>

The t<U+0101>las in Hindustani music are somewhat more complicated. To begin with, they are not systematically codified, but rather comprise a miscellany of patterns from a number of different repertories. Secondly, the counting units (''m<U+0101>tr<U+0101>'') of each t<U+0101>la are grouped into segments called ''vibh<U+0101>g'', which constitute slower "beats" of from 1<U+00BD> to 5 of those counting units. Third, in addition to the sounded ''vibh<U+0101>g'', marked by hand-claps (''t<U+0101>l<U+012B>''), there are also ''vibh<U+0101>g'' marked only by a wave of the hand<U+2014>the so-called ''kh<U+0101>l<U+012B>'' beats. The two quintuple t<U+0101>las in these repertories are ''Jhapt<U+0101>l''<U+2014>2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;+&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;+&nbsp;3<U+2014>and ''S<U+016B>lt<U+0101>l''<U+2014>2&nbsp;+&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;(2). Both are measured by ten ''m<U+0101>tr<U+0101>'' units, but ''Jhapt<U+0101>l'' is divided into four unequal ''vibh<U+0101>g'' (the third being a ''kh<U+0101>l<U+012B>'' beat) in two halves of five ''m<U+0101>tr<U+0101>'' each, and ''S<U+016B>lt<U+0101>l'' is divided into five equal ''vibh<U+0101>g'', the second and fifth of which are ''kh<U+0101>l<U+012B>''. <ref>Powers 2001, (iv).</ref>

The ''[[Gasa (poetry)|kasa]]'' repertory of traditional [[Korean court music]] often employs cycles in quintuple time, even though Korean traditional music terminology has no specific term for it, and the meter is rarely found in Korean folk music. This repertory can be traced back in some cases to the fifteenth century, and quintuple is the oldest surviving traditional Korean meter.<ref>Condit 1978, 3 and 7; Lee 1981, 119 and 123.</ref>

===Australia===
Quintuple meter occurs as a variation in some women's dance songs of [[Indigenous Australians]], where a 5/8 measure is occasionally inserted into songs with a basic duple or four-beat pattern.<ref>May and Wild 1967, 210, 216.</ref>

===European folk music===
Many European folk and traditional repertories also feature quintuple meter. This is particularly true of Slavic cultural groups. In north-eastern Poland, for example (especially in [[Kurpie]], [[Masuria]], and northern [[Podlaskie]]), five-beat bars are frequently found in wedding songs, with rather slow tempos and not accompanied by dancing. In the south, the dance ''ozwodny'' has five-bar phrases. Traditional Russian wedding songs also are in quintuple time.<ref>Taruskin 1992a; Taruskin 1992b.</ref> The Poles and Russians share this proclivity for quintuple meter with the Finns, [[Sami people|Sames]] (Lapps), Estonians, and Latvians.<ref>St<U+0119>szewski 2001.</ref> In Finland, the [[Kalevala]]ic "[[Trochaic tetrameter|runometric]]" songs are the most distinctive feature of folk music, and the most common melody of these epic songs is in quintuple meter. This melody was described in the oldest study of runo singing in 1766, but first published in a musical transcription only about 20 years later.<ref>Asplund 1985, 28.</ref> One South Slavic example is recorded in a manual published in 1714 by the Venetian dancing master Gregorio Lambranzi. It is a [[Furlana|forlana]] titled "Polesana", probably meaning "From [[Pula|Pola]]", a city in [[Istria]]<U+2014>today a part of Croatia but a Venetian possession until 1947. Although Lambranzi notated this dance in 6/8 time, its recurring phrase structure shows it to be in compound-quintuple time, so that its correct form is actually written in 15/8.<ref>Heartz 1999, 144<U+2013>46.</ref> 

Spanish folk music is also noted for the use of quintuple meter, particularly well-known examples being the [[Castile and Le<U+00F3>n|Castilian]] ''rueda'' and the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] ''[[zortziko]]'', but it is also found in the music of [[Extremadura]], [[Aragon]], [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], and [[Catalonia]].<ref>Cunningham and Aiats 2001, 2(ii)(a).</ref> Some types of the folk dances collectively referred to as [[gavotte]]s, and stemming from [[Lower Brittany]] in France are in 5/8 metre, though 4/4, 2/4, and 9/8 are also found.<ref>Little 2001.</ref> In the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] region of [[Kochersberg]], a peasant dance called the ''Kochersberger Tanz'' is in 5/8 time, and is similar to a dance of the [[Upper Palatinate]] in [[Bavaria]] called ''[[Zwiefacher|Der Zwiefache<!--So spelled in the source.-->]]'' or ''Gerad und Ungerad'', because it alternates even and uneven bars (2/8 and 3/8).<ref>Engel 1876, 12.</ref>

===European art music===
====Medieval and Renaissance====
In European art music it only became possible in the 14th century to notate quintuple rhythms unambiguously, through the use of minor or reversed [[Diatonic and chromatic#Medieval_coloration|coloration]].<ref name="Hiley 2001">Hiley 2001.</ref> In some instances from the late-14th-century [[Ars subtilior]] period, quintuple passages occur which are long enough to regard as an established meter. For example, in the ''secunda pars'' of an anonymous two-voice ''Fortune'' (MS Paris, Biblioth<U+00E8>que Nationale ''ital. 568'', fol. 3), a "clear and definite rhythm" in the upper part creates a 5/8 meter set against the 6/8 of the lower part.<ref>Apel 1961, 401.</ref>  The earliest ''complete'' European compositions in quintuple time, however, appear to be seven villancicos in the [[Cancionero de Palacio|Cancionero Musical de Palacio]], which were composed between 1516 and 1520.<ref>Hiley 2001; Schmitt 1995.</ref> Notation of the quintuple meter in these seven pieces is achieved in various ways<ref name="Hiley 2001"/>:
* [[Juan del Encina]] uses the mensuration {{music|cut-time}}5/1 in "Amor con fortuna", but in "Tan buen ganadico", he uses a signature of 3<sup>2</sup>/5<sup>2</sup>.
* [[Juan de Anchieta]] uses 5/1, the ''proportio quintupla'', in both "Con amores, mi madre", and "Dos <U+00E1>nades, madre".
* The anonymous "Pensad ora<U+2019>n al" uses the mensuration C5/2.
* "Las mis penas madre" by [[Pedro de Escobar]] and "De ser mal casada" by Diego Fern<U+00E1>ndez both use just the proportion sign 5/2.
Other examples from the 16th century include the ''[[In Nomine]] "Trust"'' by [[Christopher Tye]]<ref>Tye 1967, 39<U+2013>42, transcribed in 5/4 throughout by the editor, Robert W. Weidner. Paul Doe (1988, 105<U+2013>107), transcribes the same piece in 5/4 except for one passage of 40 beats, which he renders as ten bars of 4/4 instead of eight bars of 5/4, on the grounds that "repeated notes in the [[Cantus firmus|CF]] permit a harmonic structure based on a normal duple metre" (Doe 1988, 150).</ref>, the "Qui tollis" section of [[Jacob Obrecht]]<U+2019>s Missa "Je ne demande", the "Sanctus" from the ''Missa Paschalis'' by [[Heinrich Isaac]],<ref name="Hiley 2001"/> and the final "Agnus Dei" of [[Antoine Brumel]]'s Missa "Bon temps".<ref>Hudson 2001.</ref> Keyboard examples from this period include the first half of an English setting of the offertory ''Felix namque'' from about 1530, and a passage in no. 41 of the ''Libro de tientos'' (1626) by [[Francisco Correa de Arauxo]].<ref name="Hiley 2001"/>

====Baroque and Classical====
In the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] eras quintuple meter is, if anything, even less frequently encountered than in the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]]. Two brief passages of 5/8 occur in the "mad scene" (act 2, scene 11) from [[George Frideric Handel|Handel's]] opera ''[[Orlando (opera)|Orlando]]'' (1732), first at the words "Gi<U+00E0> solco l<U+2019>onde" ("Already I am cleaving the waves") when the demented hero believes he has embarked on [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]]<U+2019>s boat on the [[Styx]], and then again two bars later.<ref>Hiley 2001.</ref> [[Charles Burney]] found this whole scene admirable, as a portrait of Orlando's madness, but observed that "Handel has endeavoured to describe the hero's perturbation of intellect by fragments of symphony in 5/8, a division of time which can only be borne in such a situation".<ref>Burney 1789, 4:364.</ref> Burney's German contemporary, [[Johann Kirnberger]], also felt that "No one can repeat groups of five and even less of seven equal pulses in succession without wearisome strain".<ref>Kirnberger [1776] 1982, 383.</ref> Another exceptional 18th-century example is an entire aria composed in 5/4 time, "Se la sorte mi condanna" found in [[Andrea Adolfati]]'s opera ''Arianna'' (1750),<ref>Hansell and Steffan 2001; Hiley 2001.</ref> but the English theatre composer [[William Reeve]], with the last movement of his ''Gypsy's Glee'' (1796), to the words "Come, stain your cheeks with nut or berry" (in 5/4 time) is credited with having composed an example in true quintuple time, "for instead of the usual division of the bar into two parts, such as might be expressed by alternate bars of 3-4 and 2-4, or 2-4 and 3-4, there are five distinct beats in every bar, each consisting of an accent and a non-accent. This freedom from the ordinary alternation of two and three is well expressed by the grouping of the accompaniment, which varies throughout the movement<U+2026>"<ref>Taylor 1890, 3:61.</ref>

====19th century====
There appear to have been several motivations for composers to use quintuple time: (1) to demonstrate technical skill, as in the Tye and Correa de Arauxo examples, (2) to produce an atmospheric effect, or to suggest unease or unusual excitement, as in Handel's ''Orlando''. In the 19th century, a third motivation arises with the rise of [[Nationalism (music)|nationalistic music]], which often invokes folk-music elements.<ref name="Hiley 2001"/> In any case, quintuple time becomes much more frequent (though still not common) in the 19th century. Early examples include Fugue 20 (Allegretto) from [[Anton Reicha]]<U+2019>s ''[[36 Fugues (Reicha)|Trente-six fugues]]'' for piano (1805),<ref>Reicha 1973, 2:35<U+2013>40.</ref> the tenor aria "Viens, gentille dame" from act 2 of [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Adrien Boieldieu]]<U+2019>s opera ''[[La dame blanche]]'' (1825),<ref>Helmore 1879, 15; Hiley 2001.</ref> and the third movement (Larghetto, con molta espressione), from [[Frederic Chopin]]<U+2019>s [[Piano Sonata No. 1 (Chopin)|Piano Sonata No. 1 in C minor, op. 4]] (1828).<ref>Chopin 1976, 19<U+2013>21.</ref> Although Reicha's fugue probably falls into the category of technical skill, the composer does mention taking as a model for the meter the Alsatian ''Kochersberger Tanz''. Nationalistic influence is clearer in the operas of the Russian composer [[Mikhail Glinka]]. The "Nuptial chorus and scene" from act 3 of the opera [[A Life for the Tsar]] (1834<U+2013>36) was the first time a composer of art music set the pentasyllabic [[hemistich]]s of Russian wedding songs in quintuple meter instead of adapting it to a more conventional one.<ref>Taruskin 1992a; Glinka 1907, 262<U+2013>64.</ref> In his next opera, ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' (1837<U+2013>42) Glinka repeated the effect in the opening of act 1, where the chorus sings an epithalamium to Lel<U+2019>, the Slavonic god of love, once again in quintuple time.<ref>Taruskin 1992b.</ref> Later Russian examples are found in [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s folk-song settings: ''Fifty Russian Folk Songs'' for piano four-hands (1868<U+2013>69), ''Children's Ukrainian and Russian Folksongs'' (book 1: 1872, book 2: 1877), and ''Sixty-Six Russian Folk Songs'' for voice and piano (1872), where quintuple meter is notated by regularly alternating signatures, usually 3/4 and 2/4.<ref>Kroetsch 1996, 18.</ref>

Shorter passages also occur in the music of [[Hector Berlioz]]: ''La temp<U+00EA>te'' (1830), has "quintuple metre for a whole section, notated in compound duple; 'bars' of 15/4 are defined by a recurring rhythmic pattern and by accents (six 'bars' covering bars 289<U+2013>306 in the 6/4 notation)",<ref name="Rushton 1983, 128"/> and the "Combat de ceste" (No. 5), from ''[[Les troyens]]'' (1856<U+2013>58), has "an attractive 5/8 section, only eight bars long".<ref name="Rushton 1983, 128">Rushton 1983, 128.</ref>

From around the middle of the century, there is [[Carl Loewe]]'s ballad for voice and piano, ''[[Prinz Eugen, der edle Ritter (Loewe)|Prinz Eugen, der edle Ritter]]'', op. 92  (to the poem by [[Ferdinand Freiligrath]], 1844), which is in 5/4 time throughout<ref>Loewe [ca. 1900].</ref> [[Ferdinand Hiller]]'s Piano Trio No. 4, op. 64 (1855) and ''Rhythmische Studien'' for piano,<ref name="Hiley 2001"/> and a String Trio by K. J. Bischoff, which was awarded a prize by the Deutsche Tonhalle in 1853.<ref>Taylor 1890.</ref> The piano virtuoso [[Charles Valentin Alkan|Valentin Alkan]] showed an interest in unusual rhythmic devices, and composed at least four keyboard pieces in quintuple time: the first three of the ''Deuxi<U+00E8>me recueil d<U+2019>impromptus'', op. 32, no. 2 (1849), Andantino, Allegretto, and Vivace (the fourth and last piece in this collection is in [[septuple meter]]),<ref name="improptu">Eddie 2007, 104; MacDonald 2001.</ref> and a 5/4 "Zorzico dance" episode in the ''Petit Caprice, r<U+00E9>conciliation'', op. 42 (1857).<ref>Eddie 2007, 110.</ref> In opera, [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], inserted several 5/4 bars in "Tristan, der Held, in jubelnder Kraft", in act 3 of ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' (1856<U+2013>59).<ref>Wiehmayer 1917, 79.</ref> Another instance from around this same time is found in [[Anton Rubinstein]]'s "sacred opera" ''Der Thurm zu Babel'' (The Tower of Babel), op. 80 (1868<U+2013>69).<ref name="Hiley 2001"/>

Three of the best-known examples of quintuple meter in the [[Orchestra|symphonic]] repertoire are from late in the [[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]] (or [[Post-romanticism#Post-Romanticism in music|post-romantic]]) period, which reaches from the mid-19th century through World War I: the second movement, "Allegro con grazia", of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky's]] [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 6 in B minor, "Path<U+00E9>tique", op. 74]] (1893),<ref>Tschaikowsky [n.d.], 58<U+2013>87; Hiley 2001.</ref> [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff's]] ''[[Isle of the Dead (Rachmaninoff)|The Isle of the Dead]]'', op. 29 (1908),<ref>Rachmaninoff 2003.</ref> and the opening movement, "Mars, the Bringer of War", of ''[[The Planets]]'' (1914<U+2013>16) by [[Gustav Holst]].<ref>Holst 1979, 1<U+2013>31.</ref> The Finnish composer [[Jean Sibelius]] used a pattern of quintuple meter in the third movement of ''[[Kullervo (Sibelius)|Kullervo]]'' (1891<U+2013>92), where <U+201C>the orchestra maintains a pattern of five beats in a bar, while the chorus elongates its lines to phrases of fifteen, ten, eight, and twelve beats, respectively<U+201D>.<ref>Ross 2007.</ref> These are [[Karelia|Karelian]] rhythms, reflecting nationalism in Sibelius's music. He used these quintuple meters as well in several male-chorus works: <U+201C>Venematka<U+201D> (no. 3 from ''Six Partsongs'', op. 18, 1893), the third movement, <U+201C>Hyv<U+00E4><U+00E4>iltaa, Vintuseri<U+201D>, from ''Rakastava'', op. 14 (1894), and <U+201C>Sortunut<U+00E4><U+00E4>ni<U+201D> (no. 1 from ''Six Partsongs'', op. 18, 1898).<ref>Hepokoski 2001.</ref>

In 1895, the British composer [[Samuel Coleridge-Taylor]] wrote the second movement, "Serenade", of his ''Fantasiest<U+00FC>cke'', op. 5, for string quartet in 5/4 time.<ref>Richards 1987, 568.</ref>

In the piano repertoire, the "Promenade", from [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' (1874), has five versions, in each of which 5/4 is mixed with other metres, regularly or irregularly: (1) 5/4 alternates with 6/4 for eight bars, then two 6/4s and one pair of 5/4 + 6/4, ending with twelve bars of 6/4; (2) 5/4 alternates regularly with 6/4 throughout (effectively 11/4); (3) regular alternation of 5/4 and 6/4 until the final two bars, which are 5/4 and C; (4) irregular mixture of 5/4, 6/4, and 7/4, with a single 3/4 bar at the end; (5) four pairs of regularly alternating 5/4 and 6/4, then an irregular mixture of 5/4, 6/4, and 7/4 to the end.<ref>Mussorgsky 1914, 2<U+2013>3, 7, 12, 18, 24<U+2013>25.</ref> To this same period (and to the Russian tradition) also belongs "Prizrak" (Phantom), in 5/8 time, which is no. 4 of [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s Four Pieces for Piano, op. 3 (1911).<ref>Prokofiev 1926, 8<U+2013>9; Nice 2003, 50; [http://everynote.com/goods.1/Prok_P_Phant3_4.pdf first 24 bars].</ref> 

These examples are all simple quintuple time. Compound quintuple meter is less frequent, but an instance is found in the middle section of the third movement, "Andante grazioso", of  [[Johannes Brahms]]'s Trio No. 3 in C minor for Piano, Violin, and Violoncello, op. 101 (1886), which  is in 15/8 with 9/8 [[Turnaround (music)|turnarounds]].<ref>Brahms 1972, 134<U+2013>37 of the score (= piano part).</ref> "F<U+00EA>tes", the second movement of [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''Nocturnes'' for orchestra, also has a recurring passage of two 15/8 bars, embedded in a context of mainly compound triple (9/8) bars.<ref>Debussy 1941, 74<U+2013>83</ref>

====20th century====
The common occurrence of quintuple meter in many folk-music traditions caused an increase in its appearance in the works of composers with nationalistic tendencies in the early 20th century.<ref name="Hiley 2001"/> Examples are the Prelude in the Unison from [[George Enescu]]'s Orchestra Suite No. 1, Op. 9 (1903),<ref>Voicana et al. 1971, 1:231.</ref> "In Mixolydian Mode", "Bulgarian Rhythm (2)", and the third of "Six Dances in Bulgarian Rhythm", nos. 48, 115, and 150 from [[B<U+00E9>la Bart<U+00F3>k]]'s ''Mikrokosmos'' (1926, 1932<U+2013>39),<ref>Bart<U+00F3>k 1940 2:13, 4:36<U+2013>37, and 6:42<U+2013>44.</ref> the "Chanson <U+00E9>pique", no. 2 from [[Maurice Ravel]]'s song cycle ''Don Quichotte a Dulcin<U+00E9>e'' (1932<U+2013>33),<ref>Ravel 1934.</ref> and the first theme group of [[Carlos Ch<U+00E1>vez]]'s ''Sinfon<U+00ED>a India'' (1935<U+2013>36), which is predominantly in 5/8 time, but mixed with other meters.<ref>Ch<U+00E1>vez 1950, 2<U+2013>7; Garc<U+00ED>a Morillo 1960, 90<U+2013>92, 186.</ref> Another impulse for the use of quintuple meter was to evoke pagan and specifically Ancient Greek culture. The 5/4 meter of the [[bacchanalia]]n "Danse g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale" concluding Ravel's ballet ''[[Daphnis et Chlo<U+00E9>]]'' (1909<U+2013>12) is a particularly well-known example.<ref>Mawer 2000b, 144, 149</ref> In his First Symphony, the ''Sinfon<U+00ED>a de Ant<U+00ED>gona'' (1933), Carlos Ch<U+00E1>vez reworked incidental music he had composed in 1932 for a production of [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'' in the adaptation by [[Jean Cocteau]]. In this symphony Ch<U+00E1>vez made extensive use of the Greek paeonic (or cretic) meter, notated in 5/8 time in the score.<ref>Garc<U+00ED>a Morillo 1960, 76; Ch<U+00E1>vez 1948, 8<U+2013>10, 13, 20<U+2013>22.</ref> 

A third example from Ravel is a particularly intense, if brief use of quintuples for symbolic purposes. This is ''Frontispice'' for two pianos (1918), written at the request of [[Ricciotto Canudo]] to accompany a philosophical meditation on [[World War I]], titled ''S.P. 503, le po<U+00E8>me du Vardar''. Canudo's title bears the numerical designation of the postal sector of his combat division, and Ravel used the numbers as the basis of his composition. Five staves of music, "<U+2018>progressing<U+2019> vertically from flats through naturals to sharps, are played by five hands (three players) in metres of 15/8 (i.e., 3 <U+00D7> 5; 3 + 5) and 5/4".<ref>Mawer 2000a, 52<U+2013>53; Ravel 1975.</ref>

[[Igor Stravinsky]]'s name is often associated with rhythmic innovation in the 20th century, and quintuple meter is sometimes found in his music<U+2014>for example, the fugato variation in the second movement of his [[Octet (Stravinsky)|Octet]] (1922<U+2013>23) is written almost uniformly in 5/8 time.<ref>White 1979, 311.</ref> Much more characteristically, however, quintuple bars in Stravinsky's scores are found in a context of constantly changing meters, as for example in his ballet ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1911<U+2013>13), where the object appears to be the combination of two- and three-note subdivisions in irregular groupings.<ref>White 1979, 212<U+2013>13.</ref>
[[File:Stravinsky, The Rite of Spring, Sacrificial Dance.PNG|thumb|center|450px|Stravinsky, "Sacrificial Dance" (excerpt), from ''The Rite of Spring'']]
This treatment of rhythm subsequently became so habitual for Stravinsky that, when he composed his [[Symphony in C]] in 1938<U+2013>40, he found it worth observing that the first movement had no changes of meter at all (though the metrical irregularities in the third movement of the same work were amongst the most extreme in his entire output).<ref>White 1979, 404<U+2013>405.</ref>

So many other composers followed Stravinsky's example in the use of irregular meters that the occasional occurrence of quintuple-time bars becomes unremarkable from the 1920s onward.<ref name="Hiley 2001"/> This is as true for composers regarded as conservative as for those labeled "progressive" or "avant garde". Examples in conservative styles include [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''A Choral Fantasia'', op. 51 (1930), where bars 23<U+2013>24 and 199<U+2013>200 are in 5/4,<ref>Holst 1977, 3, 30<U+2013>31.</ref> [[Benjamin Britten]]'s String Quartet No. 2, op. 35 (1945), where the eleventh bar after rehearsal '''K''' in the first movement, "Allegro calmo senza rigore", is in 5/4,<ref>Britten 1946, 15.</ref> and all three movements of [[Samuel Barber]]<U+2019>s String Quartet, op. 11 (1936): 5/4 bars are found in the outer movements<U+2014>bars 28, 49, 55, 174, and 180 of the opening "Molto allegro e appassionato", and bar 19 of the "Molto allegro (come prima)" finale<ref>Barber 1943, 2<U+2013>4, 9<U+2013>10, 14.</ref><U+2014>and three 5/2 bars (4, 31, and 60) in the central "Molto adagio"<U+2014>the well-known [[Adagio for Strings]].<ref>Barber 1943, 11<U+2013>13.</ref> Examples in more progressive styles are found in the works of the Argentine [[Alberto Ginastera]], both in his early, nationalistic works, and in his later, "neo-expressionist" style: The four bars preceding rehearsal 66 in "Los peones de hacienda", from the ballet ''Estancia'', op. 8 (1941) are in 5/8,<ref>Ginastera 1955, 18.</ref> bars 16 and 21 of "In the First Pentatonic Major Mode (En el 1er modo pent<U+00E1>fono mayor)", no. 12 from ''12 American Preludes'' for piano (1944) is in 5/2),<ref>Ginastera 1946, 1:12<U+2013>13.</ref> and bar 179 of the third movement, "Vivace", of the Harp Concerto, op. 25 (1956<U+2013>65) is in 5/16.<ref>Ginastera 1974, 101.</ref>

Amongst entire movements with a constant five-to-a-bar rhythm is the second-movement "Lament" of the Double Concerto for Two Violins and Orchestra, op. 49 (1929), by Gustav Holst.<ref>Holst 1973, 13<U+2013>14.</ref> One particularly notable pre<U+2013>World War II quintuple-meter composition is the popular first movement, "Aria (Cantilena)" (1938), of the ''[[Bachianas Brasileiras|Bachianas Brasileiras no. 5]]'' by [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]] (the second movement was added only in 1945). The opening and closing parts of this aria for soprano and orchestra of cellos is predominantly in 5/4, and the middle section is entirely in that meter.<ref>Villa-Lobos 1947.</ref>

In the post-war period, Benjamin Britten set "Green Leaves Are We, Red Rose Our Golden Queen", the opening chorus from his opera ''[[Gloriana]]'', op. 53 (1952<U+2013>53, rev. 1966), in 5/4 time.<ref>Howard 1969, 108.</ref> [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] set Fugues 12, 17, and 19 from his Twenty-Four Preludes and Fugues for piano, op. 87 (1950<U+2013>51) entirely in 5/4 time, as well as interspersed this time signature with other meters in Preludes 9, 20, and 24, and in Fugues 15 and 16 from the same collection.<ref>Kroetsch 1996, 69<U+2013>70.</ref>

Quintuple meter is sometimes employed to characterize particular variations of works in [[variation form]]. Examples include the third movement, "Variations on a Ground", from the Double Concerto for Two Violins and Orchestra, op. 49 (1929), by Gustav Holst (11th and 18th variations in 5/4),<ref>Holst 1973, 17<U+2013>18, 22.</ref> "Variation IV: Pi<U+00F9> mosso" (in 5/8 time), in Part I of ''The Age of Anxiety: Symphony No. 2'' (1949) by [[Leonard Bernstein]].<ref>Bernstein 1993, 12<U+2013>16.</ref> Britten composed his ''Canticle III ("Still Falls the Rain")'', op. 55 (1954), in variation form, with the "Theme", "Variation IV", and "Variation VI" all in 5/4.<ref>Britten 1956, 1, 9, and 15.</ref> In a similar fashion, extended single-movement compositions may set off large sections by using contrasting meters. Quintuple meter is used in this way by [[Rob du Bois]] in his Concerto for Two Violins and Orchestra (1979), where bars 160<U+2013>75 and 227<U+2013>77 are in 5/8.<ref>Bois 1979, 28<U+2013>30 and 39<U+2013>42.</ref>

===Jazz and popular music===
Until after the Second World War, quintuple time was virtually unheard of in the American genres of [[jazz]] and popular music. When in 1944, Stravinsky was commissioned by [[Billy Rose]] to compose a fifteen-minute dance component to be incorporated into his Broadway revue, ''The Seven Lively Arts'', Stravinsky composed ''Sc<U+00E8>nes de ballet'', to be choreographed by [[Anton Dolin]]. Rose was enthusiastic about the new score when initially he saw the piano reduction made by [[Ingolf Dahl]], but later was dismayed by the sound of the orchestra, and offended the composer by telegraphing the suggestion that Stravinsky should allow the scoring to be "retouched" by [[Robert Russell Bennett]], who "orchestrates even the works of [[Cole Porter]]".<ref>White 1979, 420<U+2013>21.</ref> Whole sections of the score had to be cut for the Philadelphia premiere, because the New York [[Pit orchestra|pit musicians]], accustomed to the conventions of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musicals]] of that period, were unable to manage the 5/8 bars that feature in Stravinsky's score.<ref>Craft 2007, 6.</ref> A dozen years later, things were changing in musical theater in New York. [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]'' opened on Broadway in December 1956, and featured a variety of meters that Billy Rose's musicians would have found as impossible as Stravinsky's. In act 1, the quartet  "Universal Good" is a chorale in 5/4 time, and the main verses of "Ballad of Eldorado" in act 2 are in 5/8, with turnarounds in 7/8 or 3/4 + 7/8.<ref>Bernstein 1994, 40, 180<U+2013>85.</ref> Later examples in musical theatre include the song "Everything's Alright", from ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], which is mainly in 5/4.<ref>Lloyd Webber and Rice 1970, 12<U+2013>17.</ref>

In 1959, the [[Dave Brubeck Quartet]] released a jazz album with music in unusual meters. It included [[Paul Desmond]]'s "[[Take Five]]", in 5/4 time. Against all expectations, the album [[Music recording sales certification|went platinum]], and "Take Five" became a [[jazz standard]].<ref name="pandora_meters"/><ref name="grove_meter">Barry Kernfeld: 'Beat: 1. Meter', ''[http://www.grovemusic.com Grove Music Online]'' ed. L. Macy (Accessed November 9, 2007)</ref> Brubeck had studied with the French composer [[Darius Milhaud]], who in turn had been strongly influenced by Stravinsky, and is credited with the systematic introduction of asymmetrical and shifting rhythms that sparked a far-reaching surge of interest in jazz and popular music in the 1960s.<ref>Macan 1997, 47.</ref> Starting in 1964, the trumpeter and band leader [[Don Ellis]] sought to fuse traditional big-band styles with rhythms borrowed from Indian and Near Eastern music. One of his largest works, for example, ''Variations for Trumpet'', is divided into six sections with meters including 5/4, 9/4, 7/4, and 32/8.<ref>Dickow 2002.</ref> Two other Ellis compositions are entirely in 5/4 time: "Indian Lady" and "5/4 Getaway".<ref>Fenlon 2002, 35, 87<U+2013>88.</ref> In 1966, the popular American television drama series "[[Mission: Impossible]] began a five-season run, with "[[Theme from Mission: Impossible|the most famous TV theme ever composed in 5/4 time]]", by [[Lalo Schifrin]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.soundtrack-express.com/osts/missionimpossibletv.htm| title = Mission: Impossible - Then and Now| work = Soundtrack Express| first = Tom| last = Daish| accessdate = 2008-03-23}}</ref> Thirty years later, it remained his most famous composition.<ref>Karger 1996.</ref>

In the late 1960s, quintuple meters began to appear with some frequency in rock-music contexts as well, where exploration of meters other than 4/4 became one of the hallmarks of [[progressive rock]]. One of the earliest examples is "[[Within You Without You]]" by [[George Harrison]], recorded on [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' LP of 1967.<ref>Fujita et al. 1993, 1037<U+2013>48.</ref><ref>Macan 1997, 47<U+2013>48.</ref> In the next two years, 5/4 meter occurred in two more Beatles songs, both by [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]]: "[[Happiness Is a Warm Gun]]"<ref>Fujita et al. 1993, 353<U+2013>58.</ref> and "[[Across the Universe]]".<ref>Fujita et al. 1993, 12-17.</ref> Under the spell of Brubeck, [[Keith Emerson]] of [[Emerson, Lake and Palmer]] began exploring unusual meters at about this same time. His first quintuple-meter piece was "Azrael, the Angel of Death", written in 1968, and the meter cropped up again three years later in the opening instrumental section, "Eruption", of the [[Tarkus (song)|title track]] and some later passages from the album ''[[Tarkus]]''.<ref name="Macan">Macan 1997, 48.</ref><ref>Emmerson, Lake, and Palmer 1980.</ref>
