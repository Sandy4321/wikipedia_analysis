'''Philip Sayce''' is a [[Wales|Welsh]] born [[guitarist]], [[singer]] and [[songwriter]] from [[Canada]].

==Early life==
Sayce was born in [[Aberystwyth]], but family moved to Canada when he was two years old, and he grew up in [[Toronto]]. His parents, Kenneth and Sheila, listened to music by [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ry Cooder]] and [[Dire Straits]], among many other artists. His parents<U+2019> love of music inspired his love for the guitar, and he also learned to play the piano and other instruments. Sayce was fifteen years old when he played in his first band. Sayce and his best friend, drummer Cassius Pereira, played in bands together throughout high school at [[Brebeuf College School]], holding band practice in their basements. Sayce's style is strongly influenced by [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], whose untimely death in August 1990 greatly affected the young guitarist.

Sayce began playing in Toronto clubs at the age of sixteen. He quickly became a regular fixture on Toronto<U+2019>s bar-scene.  One of the clubs Sayce frequented was Grossman's Tavern in Toronto, known for its famous jam sessions with artists such as [[Robbie Robertson]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Jeff Healey]].  His other musical influences include [[B. B. King]], [[Albert King]], [[Albert Collins]], [[Buddy Guy]], and [[Robert Cray]].  Sayce joined Healey's band in 1997 and toured the world for three and a half years, playing such places as Baden Baden, Germany, Brazil, Finland and the prestigious [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland.

==Career==
Sayce quickly gained notoriety as a teenage axe-slinger through his regular gigs at Toronto clubs, and he gradually developed a solid fan base.

Looking to further expand his musical horizons, Sayce moved to Los Angeles.  He soon landed a gig with [[Uncle Kracker]] and toured with him for eighteen months. With Uncle Kracker, Philip appeared on ''New Year<U+2019>s Rockin<U+2019> Eve'', ''[[Regis and Kelly]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992 TV series)|The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', and ''The CBS Early Show''.

Sayce also starred in and wrote the music for the 2002 short film, ''Cockroach Blue'', produced and directed by award-winning Robert Crossman. The film was shown at the 2003 [[Woodstock Film Festival]] and received popular acclaim.

In the fall of 2003, Sayce unexpectedly met [[John Shanks]] at an impromptu jam session in the amp department at [[Westwood Music]] in Los Angeles.  Coincidentally, just a week before, two-time Grammy award winner [[Melissa Etheridge]] had mentioned to Shanks that she was looking for a guitar player and was thinking of trying somebody different. Shanks referred Sayce to her and in December 2003, Sayce joined Etheridge and her band for The Lucky Tour. Sayce also appears on Etheridge's ''[[Lucky (Melissa Etheridge album)|Lucky]]'' CD and the ''Lucky Live'' DVD, released in September, 2004, "Melissa Etheridge Greatest Hits: The Road Less Traveled" released in 2005, "The Awakening" released in 2007, and "A New Thought For Christmas" released in September 2008.

Sayce appeared with Etheridge at the [[2007 Academy Awards]], [[Live Earth]] in 2007, The [[2005 Grammy Awards]] as part of a tribute to [[Janis Joplin]] (along with [[Joss Stone]]), and at the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]] in Denver, Colorado.
