These documents formed the philosophical foundation for the nullification movement.]]

The '''Report of 1800''' was a resolution drafted by [[James Madison]] arguing for the [[sovereignty]] of the individual [[U.S. State|states]] under the [[United States Constitution]] and against the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]].<ref>The document is also known as the '''Virginia Report of 1800''', the '''Report of 1799''', '''Madison's Report''', or the '''Report on the Alien and Sedition Acts'''.</ref> The [[Virginia General Assembly]] adopted the Report in January 1800. The document primarily subtly amends arguments from the 1798 [[Virginia Resolutions]], and the main reason for producing the Report was to answer criticisms that had been leveled at the Resolutions. The Report was the last important explication of the Constitution produced before the 1817 Bonus Bill Veto Message by Madison, whose later repositioning as an extreme nationalist won him nationalist praise, despite his substantial defeat in the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, as the "Father of the Constitution."<ref>See, e.g., Brant's subtitle "Father of the Constitution."</ref>

The arguments made in the Resolutions and the Report were later used frequently during the [[nullification crisis]] of 1832, when [[South Carolina]] declared federal [[tariff]]s to be unconstitutional and void within the state. Madison, however, rejected the concept of nullification and the notion that his arguments supported such a practice. Whether Madison's theory of [[republicanism]] really supported the nullification movement, and more broadly whether the ideas he expressed between 1798 and 1800 are consistent with his work before and after this period, are the main questions surrounding the Report in the modern literature.

==Background==
Madison, a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], was elected to the Republican-dominated Virginia General Assembly from [[Orange County, Virginia|Orange County]] in 1799. A major item on his agenda was the defense of the General Assembly's 1798 [[Virginia Resolutions]], of which Madison had been the draftsman.<ref>Madison initially decided to run for office mainly to counteract the strength of prominent Federalist [[Patrick Henry]], who was set to be elected to the House. However, Henry died over the summer, leaving the Republicans free to pursue their plans with no substantial opposition. Madison, 303.</ref> The Resolutions, usually discussed together with [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s contemporaneous [[Kentucky Resolutions]], were a response to various perceived outrages perpetrated by the [[Federalist Party|Federalist]]-dominated national government. The most significant of these were the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], four laws that allowed the President to deport [[alien (law)|aliens]] at will, required a longer period of residence before aliens could become [[citizen]]s, and made it a crime to publish malicious or defamatory material against the government or its officials. Republicans were outraged by the legislation, and Madison and Jefferson drafted the highly critical Resolutions adopted in response by the [[Virginia]] and [[Kentucky]] state legislatures.

The Virginia Resolutions had in the year since publication received highly critical replies from state legislatures, including those of [[New York]], [[Delaware]], and the five [[New England]] states. The reason for the criticism was that the General Assembly, led in the effort by state-sovereignty advocate John Taylor of [[Caroline County, Virginia|Caroline]], had put a state-sovereignty spin on the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 despite Madison's hopes.  These replies contended that the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] had the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether federal laws were constitutional, and that the Alien and Sedition Acts were constitutional and necessary.<ref>Madison, 303.</ref> The Federalists accused the Republicans of seeking disunion, even contemplating violence.<ref>Koch and Ammon, 163.</ref> At the time, leading Virginia Republican figures such as Rep. William Branch Giles (in public) and Sen. John Taylor of Caroline (in private) actually were contemplating disunion, and the Virginia General Assembly chose this juncture for finally constructing a new state armory in Richmond, so there was some truth to the charge.

Jefferson, the leader of the Republican Party and then<U+2013>[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], wrote to Madison in August 1799 outlining a campaign to strengthen public support for the principles expressed in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 (commonly referred to as "the principles of '98"):
{{quotation|That the principles already advanced by Virginia & Kentucky are not to be yielded in silence, I presume we all agree. I should propose a declaration of Resolution by their legislatures on this plan. 1st. Answer the reasonings of such of the states as have ventured in the field of reason, & that of the Committee of Congress. ... 2. Make a firm protestation against the principle & the precedent; and a reservation of the rights resulting to us from these palpable violations of the constitutional compact by the Federal government, ... 3. Express in affectionate and conciliatory language our warm attachment to union with our sister-states, and to the instrument & principles by which we are united; <U+2026> fully confident that the good sense of the American people and their attachment to rally with us round the true principle of our federal compact. But determined, were we to be disappointed in this, to sever ourselves from that union we so much value, rather than give up the rights of self government which we have reserved, & in which alone we see liberty, safety & happiness.<ref>Letter from Jefferson to Madison of [[August 23]], [[1799]]. Quoted in Koch and Ammon, 165<U+2013>166.</ref>}}
In response to this letter, Madison visited Jefferson at [[Monticello]] during the first week of September.<ref>Madison, 304.</ref> Their discussion was important in that it persuaded Jefferson to depart from his radical stance on dissociation from the Union, which is expressed at the end of the excerpt above. At the very least, Virginia or Kentucky taking such a stance publicly would have justified the Federalist attacks against the secessionist tendencies of the Republicans. Madison won over Jefferson, who shortly thereafter wrote to [[Wilson Cary Nicholas]] that: "From [this position] I retreat readily, not only in deference to [Madison's] judgment but because as we should never think of separation but for repeated and enormous violations, so these, when they occur, will be cause enough of themselves."<ref>Letter from Jefferson to W.C. Nicholas of [[September 5]], [[1799]], quoted in Brant, 467.</ref> Adrienne Koch and Harry Ammon, examining Jefferson's later writing, conclude that Madison had a significant role "in softening Jefferson's more extreme views."<ref>Koch and Ammon, 167.</ref>

Jefferson hoped for further involvement with the production of the Report and planned to visit Madison at [[Montpelier (James Madison)|Montpelier]] on his way to [[Philadelphia]], the national capital, for the winter session of the [[United States Congress]]. However, [[James Monroe]], who would become Governor of Virginia before the end of the year, visited Jefferson at Monticello and cautioned him against meeting with Madison, since another meeting between two of the most important Republican leaders would provoke significant public comment.<ref>Koch and Ammon, 169<U+2013>170.</ref> The task of writing the Virginia Report was left solely to Madison. Jefferson underlined the importance of this work in a [[November 26]] letter to Madison in which he identified "protestations against violations of the true principles of our constitution" as one of the four primary elements of the Republican Party plan.<ref>Letter from Jefferson to Madison of [[November 26]], [[1799]], quoted in Koch and Ammon, 170.</ref>

==Production and passage==
The Assembly session began in early December. Once at [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], Madison began drafting the Report,<ref>Madison, 303.</ref> though he was delayed by a weeklong battle with dysentery.<ref>Brant, 467.</ref> On [[December 23]], Madison moved for the creation of a special seven-member committee with himself as chairman to respond to "certain answers from several of the states, relative to the communications made by the Virginia legislature at their last session." The committee members were Madison, [[John Taylor of Caroline|John Taylor]], [[William Branch Giles]], [[George Keith Taylor]], [[John Wise (Virginia politician)|John Wise]], [[John Mercer (Virginia politician)|John Mercer]], and [[William Daniel (Virginia politician)|William Daniel]].<ref>Madison, 296, 304.</ref> The next day, Christmas Eve, the committee produced a first version of the Report.<ref>Neither this version nor any of Madison's drafts survive.</ref> The measure came before the House of Delegates, the lower house of the General Assembly, on [[January 2]]. 

Though certain to pass due to the Republican majority, which had recently been solidified by the election of a Republican clerk and speaker of the House, the Report was debated for five days. The main point of contention was the meaning of the third of the Virginia Resolutions:
{{quotation|<U+2026>this Assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare, that it views the powers of the federal government, as resulting from the compact to which the states are parties; <U+2026> and that in case of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers not granted by said compact, the states who are parties thereto have the right <U+2026> to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil<U+2026>the authorities, rights, and liberties appertaining to them.<ref>Madison, 189. The Virginia Resolutions emerged from the House of Delegates on [[December 21]], [[1798]].</ref>}}
This resolution had been the principal target of the Federalist attack on the Resolutions.<ref>Gutzman, 582.</ref> Particularly at issue was the sense in which the states were parties to the federal compact. The Report was ultimately amended to provide greater clarity on this issue by emphasizing that it was the people themselves, acting through the states in their sovereign capacity, who were parties to the Constitution. The amended Report passed the House of Delegates on [[January 7]] by a margin of 60 to 40. At some point in the next two weeks, it passed the Senate by a margin of 15 to 6.<ref>Madison, 305.</ref>

The Report was received warmly by Virginia Republicans. The General Assembly arranged for five thousand copies to be printed and distributed in the state, but there was not much public response to the Report, and it appears to have had relatively little impact on the [[United States presidential election, 1800|presidential election of 1800]] (which was, nevertheless, a major victory for the Republicans and a repudiation of Federalist policies). Parties outside Virginia seemed uninterested in the rehashing of the 1798 Resolutions, and in other states there was very little public comment. Jefferson eagerly sought copies for distribution to Republican members of Congress departing for their home states, and when they failed to arrive he entreated Monroe for at least one copy that he could reproduce. Despite Jefferson's approval of and attempt to distribute Madison's work, the national reaction was tepid.<ref>Koch and Ammon, 171; Madison, 306.</ref> Though it had little impact on the immediate election, Madison's Report clarified the legal argument against the Acts and for [[states' rights]] in general, particularly in its advancement of the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] rather than the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth]] as the main bulwark against federal encroachment on state autonomy.<ref>Lash, 183<U+2013>184.</ref>

==Argument==
The general purpose of the Report was the affirmation and expansion of the principles expressed in the [[Virginia Resolutions]]. The first major goal of the Resolutions was to bring about the repeal of the Alien and Sedition Acts by generating public opposition that would be expressed through the state legislatures. Madison sought to accomplish this by demonstrating conclusively that the Acts violated the constitution. Laying into the Acts in his Report, Madison described many breaches of constitutional limits. The Alien Act granted the President the unenumerated power of deporting friendly aliens.<ref>The Republicans did not oppose the [[Alien Enemies Act]], which permitted the deportation of enemy aliens, and is still in force.</ref> Contrary to the Sedition Act, the federal government had no power to protect officials from dissent or libelous attack, beyond the protection it accorded to every citizen; indeed, such special intervention against the press was "expressly forbidden by a declaratory amendment to the constitution."<ref>Madison, 341.</ref> As well, Madison attacked Federalist carriage laws and bank laws as unconstitutional.

To remedy the defects revealed by the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts, Madison called for citizens to have an absolute right to free speech. Madison writes that the ability to prosecute speech amounts to "a protection of those who administer the government, if they should at any time deserve the contempt or hatred of the people, against being exposed to it."<ref>Madison, 344.</ref> [[Freedom of the press]] was necessary, because "chequered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted [to the press] for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression."<ref>Madison, 338.</ref> The Report supported a strict interpretation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. While the Federalists interpreted the amendment as limiting the power of Congress over the press, but implying that such power existed, Madison argued that the First Amendment wholly prohibited Congress from any interference with the press.

More generally, the Report made the argument in favor of the sovereignty of the individual states, for which it is best known. The basic message was that the states were the ultimate parties constituting the federal compact, and that therefore the individual states were ultimate arbiters of whether the compact had been broken by the usurpation of power. This doctrine is known as the  [[compact theory]]. It was the presence of this argument in the Resolutions that had allowed the Federalists to paint the Republicans as leaning toward secession; in the amended Report the line is moderated, with an emphasis that it is the states as political societies of the people (and therefore, one reads in, not the state legislatures alone) which possess this power. Either formulation would help the Republican cause by refuting the finality of any constitutional interpretation advanced by the Congress and federal judiciary, both of which were dominated by Federalists.

In defense of Virginia Republicans and the Resolutions, Madison emphasized that even if one disagreed with the compact theory, the Virginia Resolutions and the Report of 1800 themselves were simply protests, which states were surely entitled to produce. They were "expressions of opinion, unaccompanied with any other effect than what they may produce on opinion by exciting reflection."<ref>Madison, 348. It is worth noting that at this period Americans still followed a British understanding in which laws could be "unconstitutional" without being illegal. Virginia's declaration that the Alien and Sedition Acts were unconstitutional did not necessarily signify a belief that the Acts were without effect.</ref> By eschewing direct action in favor of influencing popular opinion, Madison tried to make clear that the Republicans were not moving toward disunion.

==Analysis==
The Report was regarded in the early 19th century as among the more important expressions of Republican principles. [[Spencer Roane]] described it as "the ''[[Magna Charta]]'' on which the republicans settled down, after the great struggle in the year 1799."<ref>Powell, 695.</ref> [[Henry Clay]] said on the floor of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] that it was from the Report of 1800, above other documents, that he had developed his own theories on constitutional interpretation.<ref>Powell, 696.</ref> [[H. Jefferson Powell]], a modern jurist, identifies three persistent themes of Republican constitutionalism which emerged from the Resolutions and the Report: (1) a textual approach to the Constitution, (2) the compact theory, and (3) that caution, not trust, should characterize our approach to those who hold political power.<ref>Powell, 705<U+2013>706.</ref> 

In more recent years, the main practical interest in the Report has been its absolutist understanding of the First Amendment. Multiple [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decisions have cited the case as evidence of the Framers' ideas on free speech. In the 1957 ''[[Roth v. United States]]'' opinion by [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]], Madison's Report is cited as evidence that "the fundamental freedoms of speech and press have contributed greatly to the development and well-being of our free society and are indispensable to its continued growth."<ref>''Roth v. United States'', 354 U.S. 476 (1957).</ref> Other cases to cite the Report for a similar purpose include ''[[Thornhill v. Alabama]]'' (1940)<ref>''Thornhill v. Alabama'', 310 U.S. 88 (1940).</ref> and ''[[Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC]]'' (2000).<ref>''Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC'', 528 U.S. 377 (2000).</ref>

In modern scholarship outside the legal arena the Report is mostly studied for its discussion of states' rights with regard to [[federalism]] and [[republicanism]]. According to Kevin Gutzman, the Report, together with the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, forms a foundation for the "radical southern states' rights tradition."<ref>Gutzman, 571.</ref> However, Madison rebuffed charges that his writings supported the constitutional interpretation advanced by pro-[[nullification]] Southerners. The Report of 1800, Madison argued, did not say the government was a compact of the individual states, as the pro-nullification elements suggested. Rather the Report of 1800 described a compact of "the people in each of the States, acting in their highest sovereign capacity."<ref>Gibson, 319. The quote is from Drew McCoy, ''The Last of the Fathers: James Madison & the Republican Legacy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), p. 134.</ref> The state governments themselves, no less than the federal judiciary, possess only delegated power and therefore cannot decide questions of fundamental importance. Madison thought the Resolutions and Report were consistent with this principle while the [[Ordinance of Nullification]] was not.<ref>Yarbrough, 42<U+2013>43.</ref>

Gutzman rejects Madison's gloss of the Report as a "specious distinction," saying it is reasonable to read into the Resolutions and the Report an "ominous challenge to federal supremacy."<ref>Gutzman, 589, 580.</ref> Drew McCoy, however, has argued that Madison indeed developed a moderate stance which stood between the nationalists and the pro-nullification camp.<ref>McCoy, cf. Gibson 320.</ref> Koch and Ammon agree, stating that "Nowhere in American political literature does there exist a more careful, precise and mature reiteration of the principles of republican self-government; and nowhere is it clearer that the intermediate existence of state governments between the people and the 'General Government' should function to prevent a totalitarian imbalance in any one center of authority."<ref>Koch and Ammon, 173.</ref>
