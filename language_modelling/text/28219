==Biography==
===Early life and Miss Chinese International===
Liu was born in [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]] on January 6, 1979 to a [[Christian]] family, the second oldest of three children.<ref name="sibling">{{cite news | autnhor= | title=Emme Wong waits to attend 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' premiere | date=2005-06-09 | work=CNMDB | pages=1 | url=http://hk.cnmdb.com/newsent/20050609/97747 | accessdate=2009-01-10 | language=Chinese}}</ref> She attended [[Pineridge Elementary School]] and [[Prince Rupert Secondary School]]. After graduating high school, she moved to [[Vancouver]] to attend [[University of British Columbia]]. Liu wanted to major in business administration, but the major required her to be [[bilingual]].<ref name="bernicespecial">{{cite news | author= | title=Miss Chinese International becomes famous in one night, Bernice Liu's sun | date=2006-08-24 | work=The Sun | pages=1 | url=http://the-sun.on.cc/channels/ent/20060814/20060813234751_0000.html?corp=1 | accessdate=2009-01-10 | language=Chinese}}</ref> Although both of her parents speak Cantonese, she had limited knowledge of the language. For the fastest and easiest way to learn it, her friends recommended she enter the [[Miss Chinese (Vancouver) Pageant]], which she did in 2000. The pageant is an annual beauty contest organized by [[Fairchild Television]], and it helps selects Vancouver representatives to enter the [[Miss Chinese International Pageant]] of [[Hong Kong]]. To Liu's surprise, she won the crown along with the title "Miss Photogenic."<ref name="bernicespecial" /> She then represented Vancouver and entered the promising Miss Chinese International Pageant a year later. She eventually won the Miss Chinese International title, as well as winning the "Miss Cosmopolitan" and "Miss Talent" awards.<ref name="chineseinternational">{{cite news | author= | title=Toronto beauty Bernice Liu wins crown and two other awards | date=2001-01-21 | work=Epoch Times | pages= 1 | url=http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/1/1/21/n37608.htm | accessdate=2009-01-09 | language=Chinese}}</ref> Soon after, Liu was offered an artist contract to Hong Kong's leading television company, [[TVB]], the same channel that hosted the Miss Chinese International pageant.<ref name="chineseinternational" /> Initially, she refused the contract, afraid that she would not be able to adapt to a new and unfamiliar environment. Eventually, she signed the contract with the support of her father, who was willing to give up work in Vancouver to help Liu develop her career in Hong Kong. The university also allowed her to put her degree on a hold for ten years.<ref name="bernicespecial" />

===Career===
Liu received her first role that same year and portrayed Princess Sam-tin in the 2001 costume sitcom, ''[[Virtues of Harmony]]''. The sitcom was a ratings hit, becoming a popular prime-time family watch for the audiences of Hong Kong. Originally an 100-episode sitcom, TVB extended the sitcom to 300 half-hour episodes, becoming the longest costume sitcom TVB has ever produced. Liu's role as the runaway princess was also highly recognized, and she became unofficially nicknamed as "Princess" by fans and the media.<ref name="bernicespecial" /> However, her portrayal earned mixed reviews, and she was criticized for her lack of fluency in [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]]. The criticism slowly decreased as she appeared in more episodes of the sitcom. Liu credited her father of this achievement, who moved to Hong Kong with her to help her in reading Cantonese dialogues and scripts.<ref name="cantonese">{{cite news | author= | title=Bernice Liu promotes new drama, must learn Mandarin first | date=2007-09-13 | work=Peng Peng | pages=1 | url=http://bbs.pengpeng.com/bbs/thread/1096705.html | accessdate=2009-01-09 | language=Chinese}}</ref> 

In 2002, after a successful reception of ''Virtues of Harmony'', TVB decided to produce a [[Virtues of Harmony II|modern spin-off]] for the sitcom.<ref name="voh2">{{cite news | author= | title=High ratings for TVB's "Virtues of Harmony" | date=2004-06-16 | work=Yinsha | pages=1 | url=http://ent.yinsha.com/file/200406/2004061615535707.htm | accessdate=2009-01-09 | language=Chinese}}</ref> Liu was given the role Joey Wong, an undergraduate fashion designer working for her father's company. That same year, Liu recorded songs for ''Happy Together'', a soundtrack consisting of songs recorded by the ''Virtues of Harmony'' cast. The album was released on February 6, 2003. While ''Virtues of Harmony II'' filming was active, Liu was given a recurring guest role in the 2002 serial drama, ''[[Golden Faith]]'' as Alice Yiu, starring opposite [[Gallen Lo]]. ''Golden Faith'' did well in Hong Kong but received mixed reviews from critics. While some critics regard it as a masterpiece, other critics whiplashes the series for its unrealistic characters. Nonetheless, the drama achieved a high rating spot, becoming one of the top ten most viewed Hong Kong series of 2002. ''[[Virtues of Harmony II]]'' was released in 2003 and also well received with good ratings. Liu, however left the series in 2004 due to co-star [[Frankie Lam]]'s marriage to actress [[Kenix Kwok]]. Lam ultimately never returned to the series even when it concluded in January 2005. The incomplete ending for Liu left viewers upset. 

Her first role in a theatrical motion picture was in ''[[My Wife is 18]]'' (2002). Liu portrayed the supporting role, Miss Lee, a [[P.E.]] teacher who has an attracting towards [[Ekin Cheng]]'s character, Sap-Saam. The film won "Best Comedy Film 2002" in Hong Kong. Liu then attracted broader attention for her role as Jessica Chiang in the 2003 serial drama ''[[Survivor's Law]]'', in which she played a sweet and clumsy trainee solicitor. The role received her critical praise and she became a popular candidate for Most Improved Actress at the annual [[TVB Anniversary Awards]]. ''Survivor's Law'' was the eighth most viewed series of 2003, peaking 37 ratings points.

Liu's singing career began a rise in 2005, when she sang the theme song for ''[[Into Thin Air]]''. The theme song became a promotional single for ''[[Lady In Red (TVB)|Lady In Red]]'', a compilation album consisting of TVB theme songs and sub songs. The single became a number one hit and won a [[Jade Solid Gold]] recognition in 2006. Following the success of the single that same year, Liu won the "Best Newcomer Awards at the [[Jade Solid Gold Top 10 Awards]]. Liu then began to sing a chain of other songs for television series, such as "Break Up" (also a track in the ''Lady In Red'' compilation), "Do You Still Need To Care," and "So In Love With You."
 
Liu emerged as a dark horse candidate by snagging the #2 spot amongst TVB's top-earning artists of 2006, mostly due to her numerous endorsement contracts. In the summer of 2006, LIu earned a contract with Nike, and became the first Asian spokesperson for the company. Her posters are now all over Asia promoting Nike yoga products. 

In 2007, Liu beat award winning-actress [[Charmaine Sheh]] to claim TVB's top earning artist spot of 2007 earning HK$4.8 million. Liu, along with [[Myolie Wu]], [[Nancy Wu]], and other TVB stars, became judges for [[Mr. Hong Kong|2007 Mr. Hong Kong]].
