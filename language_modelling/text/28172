{{Dutch Royal Family}}

'''Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange''' (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: Prins van Oranje). (given names: ''Willem-Alexander Claus George Ferdinand''; born 27 April 1967) is the eldest son of [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands]] and the Crown Prince heir apparent to the [[Dutch monarchy|Dutch throne]].

==Early life and education==
Willem-Alexander Claus George Ferdinand, The [[Prince of Orange]], Prince of the Netherlands, Prince of [[House of Orange-Nassau|Orange-Nassau]], [[Jonkheer]] van Amsberg is the eldest son of Queen [[Beatrix of the Netherlands]] and her late husband, [[Claus von Amsberg|Prince Claus of the Netherlands, Jonkheer van Amsberg]]. The Prince was born in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].  His godparents are [[Prince Bernhard of Lippe|Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands]] (his grandfather), Prince Ferdinand von Bismarck, former Dutch Prime Minister Dr. [[Jelle Zijlstra]], Gosta van Amsberg, [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II of Denmark]] (at the time Crown Princess of Denmark), and Renee Smith. He was educated at a [[Protestant]] high school in [[The Hague]], and also attended the [[Atlantic College|United World College of the Atlantic]] in Wales prior to university. He has been groomed in state affairs to assume the Dutch throne one day. He earned an [[academic degree]] in [[history]] from [[Leiden University]] and is interested in international [[water|water management]] issues.

==Work and royal duties==
Prince Willem-Alexander is an honorary member of the World Commission on Water for the 21st Century and patron of the Global Water Partnership, a body established by the [[World Bank]], the [[UN]], and the Swedish Ministry of Development. He was appointed as the Chairperson of the United Nations Secretary General<U+2019>s Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation on December 12th, 2006. 

The prince is a member of the [[Dutch Council of State|Raad van State]], the highest council to the Dutch government that is chaired by his mother, Queen Beatrix. As part of his Royal duties, he holds commissions in the Dutch Army (as brigadier), Navy (as commandeur) and Air Force (as commodore) and was a patron of the Dutch Olympic Games Committee until 1998 when he was made a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC). To celebrate the 100 year anniversary of [[1928 Summer Olympics]] held in Amsterdam, he has expressed support to bid for the [[2028 Summer Olympics]].<ref>[http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/olympic_bids/future_bids_2016/1216133621.html Netherlands May Bid For 2028 Games]</ref>

On behalf of the Crown, the Prince carries out various other representative duties.

==Leisure activities==
He is an aircraft pilot and sportsman. In 1989, the Prince flew as a volunteer for the "African Medical Research and Education Foundation" (AMREF) in [[Kenya]], and in 1991 he spent a month flying for the Kenya Wildlife Service.
To make sure he flies enough [[mile]]s a year, so that he can hold his license to fly, he also regularly flies the Dutch Royal Airplane when he and his family travel abroad.

Using the name "[[van Buren]]", one of the less well-known surnames of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]], he has participated in the New York City [[New York City Marathon|Marathon]], where his aunt, [[Princess Christina of the Netherlands|Princess Christina]], and several cousins live. In the Netherlands, he was a participant in the Frisian [[Elfstedentocht|Eleven Cities ice skating marathon]].

The Prince was also seen cheering on the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands' national football team]] during their hosting year, at [[Euro 2000]], allways wearing an orange vest. He memorably gave a nervous laugh of disbelief as the Netherlands missed their second penalty of normal time against the Italians in the semi-final.

==Marriage== 
[[Image:Willemmaxima trouwen.jpg|left|thumb|Prince Willem-Alexander and [[Princess M<U+00E1>xima of the Netherlands|Princess M<U+00E1>xima]] kiss on the balcony of the [[Royal Palace (Amsterdam)|Royal Palace]] in [[Amsterdam]] on their wedding day in 2002]]

In a 1999 television interview, the Prince declared that he wouldn't marry in the next 10 years.  At the time, he was 32 years old, and his father didn't marry until he was nearly 40.

Nonetheless, on 2 February 2002, he married at [[Beurs van Berlage]] in [[Amsterdam]] [[Princess M<U+00E1>xima of the Netherlands|M<U+00E1>xima Zorreguieta Cerruti]] (born 17 May 1971), an [[Argentina|Argentine]] woman of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[Italians|Italian]] ancestry who, prior to their marriage, worked as an [[investment]] [[banker]] in [[New York City]].

Like all Dutch monarchs, Prince Willem-Alexander is a nominal member of the [[Protestant]] [[Dutch Reformed Church]] but, unlike the highly controversial 1964 [[marriage]] to a Roman Catholic by his aunt, [[Princess Irene of the Netherlands|Princess Irene]], religion was not a major issue in the Prince's marriage.  

The prince is a direct descendant of [[Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange]], eldest daughter of British [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. However, under the [[Act of Settlement 1701|British Act of Settlement]], Prince Willem-Alexander forfeited his (distant) succession rights to the throne of each of the sixteen [[Commonwealth Realm]]s, because he married a Roman Catholic.

The issue of M<U+00E1>xima's father, Jorge Horacio Zorreguieta Stefanini, was rather sensitive. He was a civilian member of the [[Jorge Videla|Videla]] [[regime]], a [[dictatorship]] that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983. As a result of the controversy, Mr. Zorreguieta agreed not to attend the royal wedding when representatives of Prime Minister [[Wim Kok]] requested that he stay away.
