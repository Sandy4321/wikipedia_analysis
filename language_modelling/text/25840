The '''Nain Rouge''', French for "red [[dwarf]]" or "red [[gnome]]," is a mythical creature that haunts [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Michigan]], [[United States]] and feared by its residents as "the harbinger of doom."   Its appearance is said to presage terrible events for the city. The Nain Rouge appears as a small child-like creature with red or black fur. It is also said to have "blazing red eyes and rotten teeth."

The creature is said to have been attacked in [[1701]] by the first white settler of Detroit, [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]], who soon after lost his fortune. The creature is also said to have appeared in [[1763]] before the [[Battle of Bloody Run]], where 59 British soldiers were killed by Native Americans from [[Chief Pontiac]]'s tribe.

Famous multiple sighting occurred in the days before the [[1805]] fire which destroyed most of Detroit. General [[William Hull]] reported a "dwarf attack" in the fog just before his surrender of Detroit in the [[War of 1812]]. 

A woman claimed to have been attacked in [[1884]], and described the creature as resembling, "a baboon with a horned head...brilliant restless eyes and a devilish leer on its face." Another attack was reported in [[1964]].

Other sightings include the day before the [[12th Street Riot]] in [[1967]] and before a huge snow/ice storm of March [[1976]], when two utility workers are said to have seen what they thought was a child climbing a utility pole which then jumped from the top of the pole and ran away as they approached.  

More recently, in the autumn of [[1996]], according to an article in the ''Michigan Believer'', the Nain Rouge was spotted by two admittedly drunken nightclub patrons, who claimed to both have heard a strange "cawing sound, similar to a crow," coming from a "small hunched-over man" who was fleeing the scene of a car burglary. The creature was described as wearing "what looked like a really nasty torn fur coat."
