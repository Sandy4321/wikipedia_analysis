'''Glacier National Park''' is located in the U.S. state of [[Montana]], bordering the  Canadian provinces of [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]]. The park encompasses over {{convert|1000000|acre|km2}} and includes parts of two mountain ranges (sub-ranges of the [[Rocky Mountains]]), over 130 named lakes, more than 1,000 different species of plants and hundreds of species of animals. This vast pristine ecosystem is the centerpiece of what has been referred to as the "Crown of the Continent Ecosystem", a region of protected land encompassing {{convert|16000|mi2|km2}}.<ref name="crown">{{cite web| title =Welcome to the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem| publisher =Crown of the Continent Ecosystem Education Consortium| url =http://www.crownofthecontinent.org/coceec.htm| accessdate = 2010-04-13}}</ref>

The region that became Glacier National Park was first inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and upon the arrival of European explorers, was dominated by the [[Blackfeet]] in the east and the [[Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation|Flathead]] in the western regions. Soon after the establishment of the park on May 11, 1910, a number of hotels and chalets were constructed by the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]]. These historic hotels and chalets are listed as [[National Historic Landmarks]], and a total of 350 locations are on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. By 1932, work was completed on the [[Going-to-the-Sun Road]], later designated a [[National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark]], which provided greater accessibility for automobiles into the heart of the park.

The mountains of Glacier National Park began forming {{Nowrap|170 million}} years ago when ancient rocks were forced eastward up and over much younger rock strata. Known as the [[Lewis Overthrust]], these sedimentary rocks are considered to have some of the finest fossilized examples of extremely early life found anywhere on Earth. The current shapes of the [[Lewis Range|Lewis]] and [[Livingston Range|Livingston]] mountain ranges and positioning and size of the lakes show the telltale evidence of massive glacial action, which carved U-shaped valleys and left behind moraines which impounded water creating lakes. Of the estimated 150 glaciers which existed in the park in the mid-19th century, only 25 active glaciers remained by 2010.<ref name="Huffpo">{{Cite news | last = Brown| first = Matthew| title = Glacier National Park loses two glaciers| newspaper = Huffington Post| publisher = | date = 2010-04-07| url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20100407/us-disappearing-glaciers/| accessdate = 2011-05-09}}</ref> Scientists studying the glaciers in the park have estimated that all the glaciers may disappear by 2030 if the current climate patterns persist.

Glacier National Park has almost all its original endemic plant and animal species. Mammals such as the [[Grizzly Bear|grizzly]] and [[mountain goat]] as well as less common ones such as the [[wolverine]] and [[lynx]] are known to inhabit the park. Hundreds of species of birds, more than a dozen fish species and even a few reptile and amphibian species have been documented. The park has numerous ecosystems ranging from [[prairie]] to [[tundra]] and the easternmost forests of [[Thuja plicata|red cedar]] and [[Tsuga|hemlock]] normally found in large numbers closer to the Pacific Ocean. Though larger forest fires are uncommon in the park, in 2003 over 10% of the park was impacted by fires.<ref name="fire">{{cite web| title =Fire Regime | publisher =National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior| url =http://www.nps.gov/glac/naturescience/fireregime.htm| date= 2008-03-29 |accessdate = 2010-04-13}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Mountain Goat USFWS.jpg|thumb|The [[mountain goat]] is the official symbol of Glacier National Park]]

According to archeological evidence, Native Americans first arrived in the Glacier area some 10,000 years ago. The earliest occupants with lineage to current tribes were the [[Salish people|Salish]], [[Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation|Flathead]], [[Shoshone]] and [[Cheyenne]]. The [[Blackfeet]] arrived around the beginning of the 18th century and soon dominated the eastern slopes of what later became the park, as well as the [[Great Plains]] immediately to the east.<ref name="overview"/> The park region provided the Blackfeet shelter from the harsh winter winds of the plains, and supplemented their traditional bison hunts with other game meat. Today, the [[Blackfeet Indian Reservation]] borders the park in the east, while the [[Flathead Indian Reservation]] is located west and south of the park. When the Blackfeet Reservation was first established in 1855 by the Lame Bull Treaty, it included the eastern area of the current park up to the Continental Divide.<ref name="Manataka">{{cite web| title =The Blackfeet Nation| publisher =Manataka American Indian Council| url =http://www.manataka.org/page255.html| accessdate = 2010-04-13}}</ref> To the Blackfeet, the mountains of this area, especially [[Chief Mountain]] and the region in the southeast at [[Two Medicine]], were considered the "Backbone of the World" and were frequented during [[vision quest]]s.<ref name="Blackfeet">{{cite book |last=Grinnell |first=George Bird |authorlink=George Bird Grinnell |title=Blackfoot Lodge Tales|publisher=Charles Scribners Sons |location=New York |year=1892 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11547 |format=PDF |accessdate= 2010-04-24 |isbn=0-665-06625-2}}</ref> In 1895, Chief White Calf of the Blackfeet authorized the sale of the mountain area, some {{convert|800000|acre|km2|-2}}, to the U.S. government for {{Nowrap|$1.5 million}} with the understanding that they would maintain usage rights to the land for hunting as long as the ceded stripe will be ''public land of the United States''.<ref name="Spence">{{Cite book| last = Spence| first = Mark David| title = Dispossessing the Wilderness| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 1999| location = New York| isbn =978-0-19-514243-3 |page= 80}}</ref> This established the current boundary between the park and the reservation.

While exploring the [[Marias River]] in 1806, the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] came within {{convert|50|mi|km|0}} of the area that is now the park.<ref name="overview"/> A series of explorations after 1850 helped to shape the understanding of the area that later became the park. In 1885, [[George Bird Grinnell]] hired noted explorer (and later well regarded author) [[James Willard Schultz]] to guide him on a hunting expedition into what would later become the park.<ref name="Hanna">{{cite book |last=Hanna |first=Warren L |title=The Life and Times of James Willard Schultz (Apikuni) |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |location=Norman, Oklahoma |isbn=0-8061-1985-3 |chapter=Exploring With Grinnell |pages=133<U+2013>145 |year=1986}}</ref>  After several more trips to the region, Grinnell became so inspired by the scenery that he spent the next two decades working to establish a national park. In 1901, Grinnell wrote a description of the region, in which he referred to it as the "Crown of the Continent", and his efforts to protect the land make him the premier contributor to this cause.<ref name="Century">{{Cite journal| last = Grinnell| first = George Bird| title = The Crown of the Continent| journal = The Century Magazine| volume = 62| pages = 660<U+2013>672| publisher = MacMillan and Co.| location = London| date = May 1901 to October 1901| url = http://books.google.com/?id=WIPPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA660&lpg=PA660&dq=The+crown+of+the+continent+in+Century+magazine&q| accessdate =2010-04-13}}</ref> A few years after Grinnell first visited, [[Henry L. Stimson]] and two companions, including a Blackfoot, climbed the steep east face of [[Chief Mountain]] in 1892.

[[File:Many glacier hotel.jpg|thumb|right|The Many Glacier Hotel on [[Swiftcurrent Lake]]]]

In 1891, the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] crossed the Continental Divide at [[Marias Pass]] {{convert|5213|ft|m|0}}, which is along the southern boundary of the park. In an effort to stimulate use of the railroad, the Great Northern soon advertised the splendors of the region to the public. The company lobbied the [[United States Congress]], and in 1897, the park was designated as a forest preserve.<ref name="Spence2">{{Cite journal| last = Spence| first = Mark David| title = Crown of the Continent, Backbone of the World| journal = Environmental History| volume = 1| page =35| publisher = Forest History Society| location = Durham, NC| date = July 1996| url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/3985155| accessdate =2010-04-13| issue = 3}}{{registration required}}</ref> Under the forest designation mining was still allowed, but was not commercially successful. Meanwhile, proponents of protecting the region kept up their efforts, and in 1910, under the influence of George Bird Grinnell, [[Henry L. Stimson]] and the railroad, a bill was introduced into the U.S. Congress which redesignated the region from a forest reserve to a national park. This bill was signed into law by President [[William Howard Taft]] on May 11, 1910.<ref name="Centennial">{{cite web| title =Glacier Centennial 2010| publisher =National Park Service| url =http://www.nps.gov/glac/parknews/glacier-centennial-2010.htm|date=2009-02-17 | accessdate = 2010-04-13}}</ref> From May until August, the forest reserve supervisor, Fremont Nathan Haines, managed the Park's resources as the first acting superintendent. In August 1910, William Logan was appointed the Park's first superintendent. While the designation of the forest reserve confirmed the traditional usage rights of the Blackfeet, the enabling legislation of the National Park does not mention the guarantees to the Native Americans. It is the position of the United States government, that with the special designation as a National Park the mountains ceded their multi-purpose ''public land status'' and the former rights ceased to exist as it was confirmed by the Court of Claims in 1935. Some Blackfeet held that their traditional usage rights still exist ''de jure''. In the 1980s armed standoffs were avoided narrowly several times.<ref name="Spence3">{{Cite journal| last = Spence| first = Mark David| title = Crown of the Continent, Backbone of the World| journal = Environmental History| volume = 1| pages =40<U+2013>41| publisher = Forest History Society| location = Durham, NC| date = July 1996| url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/3985155| accessdate =2010-04-13| issue = 3}}{{registration required}}</ref>

The Great Northern Railway, under the supervision of president Louis W. Hill, built a number of hotels and [[chalet]]s throughout the park in the 1910s to promote tourism.  These buildings, constructed and operated by a Great Northern subsidiary called the [[Glacier Park Company]], were modeled on Swiss architecture as part of Hill's plan to portray Glacier as "America's Switzerland". Vacationers commonly took pack trips on horseback between the lodges or utilized the seasonal stagecoach routes to gain access to the [[Many Glacier]] area in the northeast.<ref name="many">{{cite web| title =Many Glacier Hotel Historic Structure Report| publisher =National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior| url =http://www.nps.gov/archive/glac/pdf/mghiststr.pdf |format=PDF |date= July 2002 |accessdate = 2010-04-13}}</ref>

The chalets, built between 1910 and 1913, included [[Belton Chalets|Belton]], St. Mary, Going-to-the-Sun, Many Glacier, Two Medicine, [[Sperry Chalet|Sperry]], [[Granite Park Chalet|Granite Park]], Cut Bank, and Gunsight Lake. The railway also built [[Glacier Park Lodge]], adjacent to the park on its east side, and the [[Many Glacier Hotel]] on the east shore of [[Swiftcurrent Lake]]. Louis Hill personally selected the sites for all of these buildings, choosing each for their dramatic scenic backdrops and views. Another developer, John Lewis, built the Lewis Glacier Hotel on [[Lake McDonald]] in 1913<U+2013>1914. The Great Northern Railway bought the hotel in 1930, and it was later renamed [[Lake McDonald Lodge]].<ref name="lm">{{cite web| last =Harrison| first =Laura Soulli<U+00E8>re| title =Lake McDonald Lodge| work =Architecture in the Parks| publisher =National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior| year =2001| url =http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/harrison/harrison9.htm| accessdate = 2010-04-13}}</ref>  Some of the chalets were in remote backcountry locations accessible only by trail.

[[File:Going to the Sun Mountain 1932.jpg|thumb|Road construction along the [[Going-to-the-Sun Road]] with [[Going to the Sun Mountain]] in background, 1932]]

After the park was well established and visitors began to rely more on automobiles, work was begun on the {{convert|53|mi|km|0}} long [[Going-to-the-Sun Road]], completed in 1932. Also known simply as the Sun Road, the road bisects the park and is the only route that ventures deep into the park, going over the Continental Divide at [[Logan Pass]], {{convert|6646|ft|m|0}} at the midway point. The Sun Road is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and in 1985 was designated a [[National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark]].<ref name="Guthrie">{{cite book| last = Guthrie| first = C.

During the 1930s, the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] assisted in the development of many of the park's trails and campgrounds.  The increase in motor vehicle traffic through the park during the 1930s also resulted in the construction of new concession facilities at [[Swiftcurrent Auto Camp Historic District|Swiftcurrent]] and [[Rising Sun (Montana)|Rising Sun]], both designed for automobile-based tourism.  These early auto camps are now also listed on the National Register.<ref name="Djuff"/>

In 2011, Glacier National Park was honored on the seventh quarter in the [[America the Beautiful Quarters]] series.<ref>[http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/atb/?local=Glacier The United States Mint Coins and Medals Program<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Glacier National Park is managed by the [[National Park Service]]; park headquarters is in West Glacier, Montana. Visitation to Glacier National Park averages slightly less than {{Nowrap|2 million}} visitors annually, however a relative few venture far from main roadways and hotels.

Glacier National Park had an operating budget of $13,190,000 for fiscal year 2008. The 2008 budget was an increase over 2007 and was used to increase employee staffing levels, but monies for maintenance projects and road work was not forthcoming.<ref name="budget">{{cite web| title = 2008 Budget for Glacier National Park| publisher = National Park Service| date = 2008-03-26| url = http://www.nps.gov/glac/parknews/news08-11.htm| accessdate = 2010-04-14 }}</ref> In anticipation of the 100th anniversary of the park in 2010, major reconstruction of the [[Going-to-the-Sun Road]] is underway, and temporary road closures are expected through then. The [[Federal Highway Administration]] is managing the reconstruction project in cooperation with the National Park Service.<ref name="FHA">{{cite web| title =Going-to-the-Sun Road project| publisher =U.S. Department of Transportation|date=2010-04-14 |url =http://www.wfl.fhwa.dot.gov/projects/gtsr/| accessdate = 2010-04-14}}</ref> Some rehabilitation of major structures such as visitor centers and historic hotels, as well as improvements in wastewater treatment facilities and campgrounds, are expected to be completed by the anniversary date. Also planned are fishery studies for Lake McDonald, updates of the historical archives and restoration of trails.

The mandate of the National Park Service is to "...&nbsp;preserve and protect natural and cultural resources". The [[Organic Act]] of August 25, 1916, established the National Park Service as a federal agency.  One major section of the Act has often been summarized as the "Mission", "...&nbsp;to promote and regulate the use of the&nbsp;... national parks&nbsp;... which purpose is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."<ref name="mission">{{cite web| title =The National Park System, Caring for the American Legacy| publisher =National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior|date=|url =http://www.nps.gov/legacy/mission.html| accessdate = 2010-04-14}}</ref> In keeping with this mandate, hunting is illegal in the park, as are [[mining]], [[forestry|logging]] and removal of natural or cultural resources. Additionally, [[oil exploration|oil]] and [[Natural gas|gas exploration]] and extraction are not permitted. These restrictions, however, caused a lot of conflict with the adjoining Blackfeet Indian Reservation considering that when they sold the land to the United States government it was with the stipulation of being able to maintain their usage rights of the area, many of which (such as hunting) had come into conflict with these regulations.<ref name="Spence"/> In 1974, a [[wilderness]] study was submitted to Congress which identified 95% of the area of the park as qualifying for wilderness designation. Unlike a few other parks, Glacier National Park has yet to be protected as wilderness, but National Park Service policy requires that identified areas listed in the report be managed as wilderness until Congress renders a full decision.<ref name="management1"/> Ninety-three percent of Glacier National Park is managed as wilderness, even though it has not been officially designated.<ref name="mammals">{{cite web|title =Mammals| publisher =National Park Service| url=http://www.nps.gov/glac/naturescience/mammals.htm | date= 2008-03-05 | accessdate = 2010-04-18}}</ref>

==Geography and geology==

[[File:Chief Mountain.jpg|thumb|[[Chief Mountain]] is an isolated peak on the easternmost boundary of the park.]]

The park is bordered on the north by Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, and the Flathead Provincial Forest and [[Akamina-Kishinena Provincial Park]] in British Columbia.<ref name="Akamina">{{cite web| title =Akamina-Kishinena Provincial Park| publisher =BC Parks|url =http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/akamina/| accessdate = 2010-04-19}}</ref> To the west, the north fork of the [[Flathead River]] forms the western boundary, while its middle fork is part of the southern boundary.

The park contains a dozen large lakes and 700 smaller ones, but only 131 lakes have been named.<ref name="lakes">{{cite web| title =Lakes and Ponds| work =Nature and Science| publisher =National Park Service|url =http://www.nps.gov/glac/naturescience/lakesandponds.htm|date=2008-03-29 |accessdate = 2010-04-19}}</ref> Lake McDonald on the western side of the park is the longest ({{convert|9.4|mi|km}}), largest in area ({{convert|6823|acre|km2}}) and deepest ({{convert|464|ft|m}}) of these lakes. Numerous smaller lakes, known as [[tarn (lake)|tarn]]s, are located in [[cirque (landform)|cirque]]s formed by glacial erosion. Some of these lakes, like Avalanche Lake and [[Cracker Lake]], are colored an opaque turquoise by suspended glacial [[silt]], which also causes a number of streams to run milky white. The lakes of Glacier National Park remain cold year round, with temperatures rarely above {{convert|50|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|0}} at their surface.<ref name="lakes"/> Cold water lakes such as these support little [[plankton]] growth, ensuring that the lake waters are remarkably clear. The lack of plankton, however, lowers the rate of pollution filtration, and pollutants have a tendency to linger longer. Consequently, the lakes are considered environmental [[bellwether]]s as they can be quickly affected by even minor increases in pollutants.<ref name="pollution">{{cite web| title =WACAP&nbsp;<U+2013> Western Airborne Contaminants Assessment Project| publisher =National Park Service|url =http://www.nature.nps.gov/air/studies/air_toxics/wacap.cfm#Database| date=2010-02-25 |accessdate = 2010-04-19}}</ref>

Two hundred waterfalls are scattered throughout the park, however, during drier times of the year, many of these are reduced to a trickle. The largest falls include those in the [[Two Medicine]] region, McDonald Falls in the McDonald Valley and Swiftcurrent Falls in the [[Many Glacier]] area, which is easily observable and close to the Many Glacier Hotel. One of the tallest waterfalls is [[Bird Woman Falls]], which drops {{convert|492|ft|m}} from a hanging valley beneath the north slope of [[Mount Oberlin]].<ref name="birdwoman">{{cite web| title =Bird Woman Falls| publisher =World Waterfall Database|url =http://www.world-waterfalls.com/waterfall.php?num=493| date=2005-09-13 |accessdate = 2010-04-21}}</ref>

===Geology===

The rocks found in the park are primarily [[sedimentary rock]]s of the [[Belt Supergroup]]. They were deposited in shallow seas over 1.6&nbsp;billion to 800&nbsp;million years ago. During the formation of the [[Rocky Mountains]] 170&nbsp;million years ago one region of rocks now known as the [[Lewis Overthrust]] was forced eastward {{convert|50|mi|km|0}}. This [[Thrust fault|overthrust]] was several miles thick and hundreds of miles long.<ref name="geology">{{cite web| title=Lewis Overthrust Fault| publisher =National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior|url =http://www.nature.nps.gov/geology/parks/glac/index.cfm| accessdate = 2010-09-03}}</ref> This resulted in older rocks being displaced over newer ones, so the overlying [[Proterozoic]] rocks are between 1.4 and 1.5&nbsp;billion years older than [[Cretaceous]] age rocks they now rest on.<ref name="geology"/><ref name="fieldnotes">{{cite web| title=Park Geology |work= Geology Fieldnotes| publisher =National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior |url= http://www.nature.nps.gov/geology/parks/glac/| date=2005-01-04 |accessdate = 2010-04-21}}</ref>

The rocks in Glacier National Park are the best preserved Proterozoic sedimentary rocks in the world, and have proved to be some of the world's most fruitful sources for records of early life. Sedimentary rocks of similar age located in other regions have been greatly altered by mountain building and other metamorphic changes, and consequently fossils are less common and more difficult to observe.<ref name="sedimentary">{{cite web|title=Exposed Rocks within the Park |work= America's Volcanic Past: Montana | publisher =United States Geological Survey|url =http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/LivingWith/VolcanicPast/Places/volcanic_past_montana.html| date= 2003-06-11 |accessdate = 2010-04-24}}</ref> The rocks in the park preserve such features as millimeter-scale lamination, ripple marks, mud cracks, salt-crystal casts, raindrop impressions, [[oolite]]s and other sedimentary bedding characteristics.

In the 1980s, the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] began a more systematic study of the remaining glaciers, which continues to the present day. By 2010, 37 glaciers remained, but only 25 of these were considered to be "active glaciers" of at least {{convert|25|acre|km2}} in area.<ref name="Huffpo"/><ref name="retreat"/> Scientists generally agree that if the current climate conditions continue, most of the remaining glaciers in the park will be gone by 2030 or even as soon as 2020.<ref name="features"/> This [[retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacier retreat]] follows a worldwide pattern that has accelerated even more since 1980. Without a major climatic change in which cooler and moister weather returns and persists, the [[Glacier mass balance|mass balance]], which is the accumulation rate versus the ablation (melting) rate of glaciers, will continue to be negative and the glaciers will eventually disappear, leaving behind only barren rock.<ref name="monitoring">{{cite web| title=Monitoring and Assessing Glacier Changes and Their Associated Hydrologic and Ecologic Effects in Glacier National Park |work=Glacier Monitoring Research | publisher =Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, United States Geological Survey |url= http://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/research/glaciers.htm| date= 2010-04-13 |accessdate = 2010-04-24}}</ref>

After the end of the Little Ice Age in 1850, the glaciers in the park retreated moderately until the 1910s. Between 1917 and 1941, the retreat rate accelerated and was as high as {{convert|330|ft|m}} a year for some glaciers.<ref name="retreat"/> A slight cooling trend from the 1940s until 1979, helped to slow the rate of retreat and in a few examples some glaciers even advanced a few tens of meters. However, during the 1980s, the glaciers in the park began a steady period of loss of glacial ice, which continues as of 2010. In 1850, the glaciers in the region near [[Blackfoot Glacier|Blackfoot]] and [[Jackson Glacier]]s covered {{convert|5337|acre|km2|1}}, but by 1979, the same region of the park had glacier ice covering only {{convert|1828|acre|km2|1}}.

The impact of glacier retreat on the park's ecosystems is not fully known, but cold water dependent plant and animal species could suffer due to a loss of habitat. Reduced seasonal melting of glacial ice may also affect stream flow during the dry summer and fall seasons, reducing water table levels and increasing the risk of forest fires. The loss of glaciers will also reduce the aesthetic visual appeal that glaciers provide to visitors.<ref name="hall"/>

===Climate===
[[File:Big Drift.jpg|thumb|The [[Big Drift]] covering the [[Going-to-the-Sun Road]] as photographed on March 23, 2006]]

As the park spans the Continental Divide, and has more than {{convert|7000|ft|m}} in elevation variance, many climates and [[microclimate]]s are found in the park. As with other alpine systems, average temperature usually drop as elevation increases.<ref name="montane">{{cite web| title =Montane Forest Ecotype|publisher =State of Montana| url =http://fwpiis.mt.gov/content/getItem.aspx?id=26470| accessdate = 2010-04-18}}</ref> The western side of the park, in the Pacific watershed, has a milder and wetter climate. Precipitation is greatest during the winter and spring averaging {{convert|2|to|3|in|mm|-1}} per month. Snowfall can occur at any time of the year, even in the summer, and especially at higher altitudes. The winter can bring prolonged cold waves, especially on the eastern side of the Continental Divide. Snowfalls are significant over the course of the winter, with the largest accumulation occurring in the west. During the tourist season daytime high temperatures average 60 to 70 <U+00B0>F (15 to 20 <U+00B0>C), and nighttime lows usually drop into the 40 <U+00B0>F (5 <U+00B0>C) range.

Glacier National Park has a highly regarded global [[climate change]] research program. Based in West Glacier, with its main headquarters in [[Bozeman, Montana]], the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] has performed scientific research on specific climate change studies since 1992. In addition to the study of the retreating glaciers, research performed includes forest modeling studies in which fire ecology and habitat alterations are analyzed. Additionally, changes in alpine vegetation patterns are documented, watershed studies in which stream flow rates and temperatures are recorded frequently at fixed gauging stations, and atmospheric research in which [[UV-B]] radiation, ozone and other atmospheric gases are analyzed over time. The research compiled contributes to a broader understanding of climate changes in the park. The data collected, when compared to other facilities scattered around the world, help to correlate these climatic changes on a global scale.<ref name="global">{{cite web| last =Fagre| first =Daniel| title =Global Change Research A Focus on Mountain Ecosystems| publisher =U.S. Geological Survey, Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center| date =2010-04-13| url =http://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/research/global.htm| accessdate = 2010-04-18}}</ref><ref name="wmi">{{cite web| title =Response of Western Mountain Ecosystems to Climatic Variability and Change: The Western Mountain Initiative| publisher =U.S. Geological Survey, Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center| date =2009-02-11| url =http://biology.usgs.gov/ecosystems/global_change/western_mountain.html| accessdate = 2010-04-18}}</ref>

Glacier is considered to have excellent air and water quality.

===Flora===
[[File:Beargrass.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Beargrass]] is a tall flowering plant commonly found throughout the park.]]

Glacier is part of a large preserved [[ecosystem]] collectively known as the "Crown of the Continent Ecosystem", all of which is primarily untouched wilderness of a pristine quality. Virtually all the plants and animals which existed at the time European explorers first entered the region are present in the park today.<ref name="bio">{{cite web| title =The Crown of the Continent Ecosystem| work= Biodiversity |publisher =National Park Service| url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/glac/resources/bio1.htm#Crown | accessdate = 2010-04-18}}</ref>

[[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwood]] and [[aspen]] are the more common deciduous trees and are found at lower elevations, usually along lakes and streams.<ref name="montane"/> The [[tree line|timberline]] on the eastern side of the park is almost {{convert|800|ft|m|0}} lower than on the western side of the Continental Divide, due to exposure to the colder winds and weather of the Great Plains. West of the Continental Divide, the forest receives more moisture and is more protected from the winter, resulting in a more densely populated forest with taller trees. Above the forested valleys and mountain slopes, alpine [[tundra]] conditions prevail, with grasses and small plants eking out an existence in a region that enjoys as little as three months without snow cover.<ref name="wildflowers">{{cite web| title =Wildflowers|work=Nature and Science| publisher =National Park Service| url = http://www.nps.gov/glac/naturescience/wildflowers.htm|date= 2008-03-25 | accessdate = 2010-04-18}}</ref> Thirty species of plants are found only in the park and surrounding National Forests.<ref name="flora"/> [[Beargrass]], a tall flowering plant, is commonly found near moisture sources, and is relatively widespread during July and August. Wildflowers such as [[Mimulus|monkeyflower]], [[lilium|glacier lily]], [[fireweed]], [[Balsamorhiza|balsamroot]] and [[Indian paintbrush]] are also common.

The forested sections fall into three major climatic zones. The west and northwest are dominated by spruce and fir and the southwest by [[Thuja plicata|redcedar]] and [[Tsuga|hemlock]]; the areas east of the Continental Divide are a combination of mixed pine, spruce, fir and prairie zones. The cedar-hemlock groves along the [[Lake McDonald]] valley are the easternmost examples of this Pacific climatic ecosystem.<ref name="forest">{{cite web| title =Forests|work=Nature and Science| publisher =National Park Service| url = http://www.nps.gov/glac/naturescience/forests.htm| date= 2008-03-29 |accessdate = 2010-04-18}}</ref>

[[Whitebark pine]] communities have been heavily damaged due to the effects of [[Cronartium ribicola|blister rust]], a non native fungus. In Glacier and the surrounding region, 30% of the Whitebark pine trees have died and over 70% of the remaining trees are currently infected. The Whitebark pine provides a high fat pine cone seed, commonly known as the pine nut, that is a favorite food of [[red squirrel]]s and [[Clark's Nutcracker]]. Both [[grizzly bear|grizzlies]] and [[American Black Bear|black bears]] are known to raid squirrel caches of the pine nuts, and it is one of the bears' favorite foods. Between 1930 and 1970, efforts to control the spread of blister rust were unsuccessful, and continued destruction of whitebark pines appears likely, with attendant negative impacts on dependent species.<ref name="whitebark">{{cite web| title =Whitebark Pine Communities| publisher =Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, U.S. Geological Survey| date =2010-04-13| url =http://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/research/whitebar.htm | accessdate = 2010-04-18}}</ref>

===Fire ecology===
[[File:GNP Wildfires 2003.jpg|thumb|Wildfires burned 10% of the park in 2003.]]

[[Wildfire|Forest fire]]s were viewed for many decades as a threat to protected areas such as forests and parks. As a better understanding of [[fire ecology]] developed after the 1960s, forest fires were understood to be a natural part of the ecosystem. The earlier policies of suppression resulted in the accumulation of dead and decaying trees and plants which would normally have been reduced had fires been allowed to burn. Many species of plants and animals actually need wildfires to help replenish the soil with nutrients and to open up areas that allow grasses and smaller plants to thrive.<ref name="fire2">{{cite web| title =A Fire Ecosystem | work =Glacier National Park Wildland Fire Management| publisher =National Park Service| url =http://www.nps.gov/archive/glac/resources/fire_2.htm| archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20061229021527/http://www.nps.gov/archive/glac/resources/fire_2.htm| archivedate =2006-12-29| accessdate =2010-04-18}}</ref>
Glacier National Park has a fire management plan which ensures that human-caused fires are generally suppressed as they always have been. In the case of natural fires, the fire is monitored and suppression is dependent on the size and threat a fire may pose to human safety and structures.<ref name="fire3">{{cite web| title =Working With Fire: a look at Fire Management

Increased population and the growth of suburban areas near parklands, has led to the development of what is known as Wildland Urban Interface Fire Management, in which the park cooperates with adjacent property owners in improving safety and fire awareness. This approach is common to many other protected areas. As part of this program, houses and structures near the park are designed to be more fire resistant. Dead and fallen trees are removed from near places of human habitation, reducing the available fuel load and the risk of a catastrophic fire, and advance warning systems are developed to help alert property owners and visitors about forest fire potentials during a given period of the year.<ref name="urban">{{cite web| title =Wildland Urban Interface | work =Glacier National Park Wildland Fire Management| publisher =National Park Service| url =http://www.nps.gov/archive/glac/resources/fire_4.htm| archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20061212051929/http://www.nps.gov/archive/glac/resources/fire_4.htm| archivedate =2006-12-12 | accessdate =2010-04-18}}</ref> Glacier National Park has an average of 14 fires with {{convert|5000|acre|km2}} burnt each year.<ref name="fire4">{{cite web| title =Fire in Glacier National Park | work =Glacier National Park Wildland Fire Management| publisher =National Park Service| url =http://www.nps.gov/archive/glac/resources/fires.htm| archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20061205053836/http://www.nps.gov/archive/glac/resources/fires.htm| archivedate =2006-12-05 | accessdate =2010-04-18}}</ref> In 2003, {{convert|136000|acre|km2}} burned in the park after a five year drought and a summer season of almost no precipitation.

[[File:Jammer.jpg|thumb|right|Glacier National Park Red Bus]]

Glacier is distant from major cities, and the closest airport is at [[Kalispell, Montana]], southwest of the park. Amtrak trains stop at East and West Glacier. A fleet of restored 1930s [[White Motor Company]] coaches, called [[Red jammer]]s, offer tours on all the main roads in the park. The drivers of the buses are called "Jammers," due to the gear-jamming that formerly occurred during the vehicles' operation. The tour buses were rebuilt in 2001. The buses were rebuilt by Ford Motor Company. The bodies were removed from their original chassis and built on modern Ford E-Series van chassis.<ref>[http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/top-1930s-White-Glacier-National-Park-Red-Bus.htm 1930s White Glacier National Park Red Bus<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> They were also converted to run on [[propane]], to lessen their environmental impact.<ref name="reds">{{cite web| author= Vanderbilt, Amy M |year= 2002 |title=On the Road Again: Glacier National Park's Red Buses | publisher =National Park Service| url =http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/25-05/25-05-06.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate =2010-04-18}}</ref>

A number of historic wooden tour boats, some dating back to the 1920s, operate on several of the larger lakes. Several of these boats have been in continuous seasonal operation on the major lakes of Glacier National Park since 1927 and carry up to 80 tourists.<ref name="boats">{{cite web| title =Our Historic Wooden Boats | publisher =Glacier Park Boat Company| url =http://www.glacierparkboats.com/historic.htm | accessdate =2010-04-18}}</ref>

Hiking is a popular activity in the park.  Over half of the visitors to the park report taking a hike on the park's nearly {{convert|700|mi|km|0}} of trails.<ref name="trails">{{cite web| author= Hayden, Bill |date= 2008-10-01 |title =Hiking the Trails | publisher =National Park Service| url =http://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/hikingthetrails.htm | accessdate =2010-04-18}}</ref> {{convert|110|mi|km|0}} of the [[Continental Divide National Scenic Trail]] spans most of the distance of the park north to south, with a few alternative routes at lower elevations if high altitude [[mountain pass|passes]] are closed due to snow. Due to the presence of bears and other large mammals, dogs are not permitted on any trails in the park, though they are permitted at front country campsites that can be accessed by a vehicle, and along paved roads. Anyone entering the United States over land or waterway from Canada must have an appropriate passport with them.<ref name="passport">{{cite web| title =Trail Status Report |publisher =National Park Service| url =http://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/trailstatusreports.htm| date= 2009-06-22 |accessdate =2010-04-18}}</ref>

[[File:GardenWall.jpg|thumb|right|A group of hikers follows the [[Garden Wall]] section of the trail, just north of the [[Logan Pass]] visitor center.  The fog is from a low-lying cloud in the valley. A red "jammer" bus can be seen on [[Going-to-the-Sun Road]] down below.]]

Numerous day hiking options are available throughout the park.  Backcountry camping is allowed at campsites along the trails.  A permit is required, which can be obtained from certain visitor centers or arranged for in advance. Much of Glacier's backcountry is usually inaccessible to hikers until early June due to accumulated snowpack and potential avalanche risk, and many trails at higher altitudes remain snow packed until July. The major campgrounds that allow vehicle access are found throughout the park, most of which are near one of the larger lakes. The campgrounds at [[St. Mary, Montana|St. Mary]] and at Apgar are open year round, but conditions are considered primitive in the off-season, as the restroom facilities are closed and there is no running water. All campgrounds with vehicle access are usually open from mid-June until mid-September.<ref name="backcountry">{{cite web| title =Backcountry Guide 2006 |publisher =National Park Service| url =http://www.nps.gov/archive/glac/pdf/BCGuide-web.pdf| archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20061230223619/http://www.nps.gov/archive/glac/pdf/BCGuide-web.pdf| archivedate =2006-12-30| format=PDF|accessdate =2010-04-18}}</ref> Guide and shuttle services are also available.

Fishing is a popular activity in the park and some of the finest [[fly fishing]] in North America can be found in the streams that flow through the park. Though the park requires that those fishing understand the regulations, no permit is required to fish the waters within the park boundary. The endangered bull trout must be released immediately back to the water if caught, otherwise, the regulations on limits of catch per day are liberal.<ref name="fishregs">{{cite web| title =Fishing Regulations 2008<U+2013>2009| publisher =National Park Service| url =http://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/upload/08Fishing.pdf |format=PDF | accessdate =2010-04-18}}</ref>

Winter recreation activities in Glacier are limited. [[Snowmobile|Snowmobiling]] is illegal throughout the park, but [[cross-country skiing]] is permitted in the lower altitude valleys away from potential avalanche zones.<ref name="winter">{{cite web| title =Operating Hours & Seasons |publisher =National Park Service| url =http://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/hours.htm|date=2010-01-05 |accessdate =2010-04-18}}</ref>
