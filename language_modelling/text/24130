The '''{{lang|fr|Grand Quartier G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral}}''' (abbreviated to '''{{lang|fr|GQG}}''' or '''{{lang|fr|Grand QG}}''' in spoken French)<ref>{{cite book|last=Becke|first=Archibald Frank|title=Military operations, France and Belgium, 1917 , Volume 2|year=1948|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fbU8AAAAIAAJ|OCLC=609151547|page=xxii}}</ref> was the [[Headquarters|general headquarters]] of the [[French Army]] during the [[First World War]].  It served as the wartime equivalent of the {{lang|fr|[[Conseil Sup<U+00E9>rieur de la Guerre]]}} and had extensive powers within an area defined by the French parliament. The {{lang|fr|GQG}} was activated by parliament on 2 August 1914, after the violation of French borders by German military patrols, and remained in existence until 20 October 1919.

The {{lang|fr|GQG}} was commanded by the Chief-of-Staff, assisted by a varying number of subordinate generals, and had representatives to the French government and president.  The physical headquarters of {{lang|fr|GQG}} was originally at [[Vitry-le-Fran<U+00E7>ois]] in the [[Marne]] department but rapid German advances in the early stages of the war forced its withdrawal to [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]], near [[Paris]], by November 1914 and it remained there for much of the rest of the war.  General [[Joseph Joffre]] served as the first Chief of Staff of {{lang|fr|GQG}} from the start of the war until December 1916 and his replacement by General [[Robert Nivelle]].  Nivelle himself was replaced in May 1917 after the failure of [[Nivelle Offensive|his Spring offensive]] and his successor was General [[Philippe P<U+00E9>tain]], who retained command of {{lang|fr|GQG}} until its dissolution in 1919.  In April 1918 the {{lang|fr|[[Grand Quartier G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral des Arm<U+00E9>es Alli<U+00E9>es]]}} was established under General [[Ferdinand Foch]] as an equivalent organisation with authority for all allied operations in France.

{{lang|fr|GQG}} was organised into a complex series of departments and bureaus that changed frequently throughout the war.  This structure has been criticised by historians for failing to encourage co-operation between departments and for widespread infighting.  There were also concerns about the autonomy and power vested in GQG.  French policy, laid down in 1913, had been for the two most important field armies, the North and North-East, to retain operational independence.  However GQG, under Joffre, assumed control of these armies in December 1915 and retained them until his replacement by Nivelle when the Minister of War, [[Joseph Gallieni]], raised concerns that the pre-war policy was being violated.  The {{lang|fr|GQG}} failed to accurately assess German casualties, basing military operations on wildly optimistic assessments of the weakness of German units and reserves.

== Origins and structure ==
[[File:Portrait of Joseph Joffre.jpg|thumb|General Joffre chief of staff from 1911 and head of the {{lang|fr|GQG}} from 1914<U+2013>16]]
The {{lang|fr|Grand Quartier G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral}} had its origins in the reforms instituted by France after their defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]].  The position, and supporting staff, of the [[Chief of Staff of the French Army]] was created with responsibility for training and mobilisation in peace and the formation of the army high command in times of war.<ref name=marshall17>{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Samuel Lyman Atwood|title=World War I|year=1964|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|location=New York|isbn=0-618-05686-6|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xN7t7DgsclcC|page=17}}</ref>  The establishment of {{lang|fr|GQG}} in 1911 formalised this situation, with {{lang|fr|GQG}} becoming the wartime counterpart of the {{lang|fr|[[Conseil Sup<U+00E9>rieur de la Guerre]] (CSG)}} and the vice-president of {{lang|fr|CSG}} becoming the chief of staff of the {{lang|fr|GQG}}.<ref name=king13>{{cite book|last=King|first=Jere Clemens|title=Generals & Politicians: Conflict Between France's High Command, Parliament, and Government, 1914<U+2013>1918|year=1951|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley & Los Angeles, USA|isbn=|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jd13Uw_ddH8C|page=13|OCLC=565328275}}</ref>  The {{lang|fr|GQG}} received extensive military powers within an area defined as the zone of army control; control of the remainder of the armed forces was retained by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|Minister of War]].  GQG was activated upon the mobilisation of the French Army by parliament, who also defined the zone of army control.<ref name=shd>{{cite web|last=LaGarde|first=Lieutenant Benoit|title=Grand Quartier G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral 1914<U+2013>1918|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:rf2vpKynLkwJ:www.servicehistorique.sga.defense.gouv.fr/contenu/functions/dc/attached/FRSHD_PUB_00000353_dc/FRSHD_PUB_00000353_dc_att-FRSHD_PUB_00000353.pdf+&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShS1YzsiejPPHuZ6YfVZTv_wN9ez71PUpHRm5OUbz4O7M7mJwXNxzWropiVntNwz3KM1LbrLSvDLZVssOo43JX3mEHfaJ8AfrKj88_xsuPZapJQJNDMBWc49MnXh2bk3-B3mbl7&sig=AHIEtbRY4leZfm3c_oVOmYk9KEjuWMnkcg|work=Sous-Serie GR 16 NN - R<U+00E9>pertoire Num<U+00E9>rique Detaille<U+00E9>|publisher=Service Historique de D<U+00E9>fense|accessdate=18 January 2013|language=French}}</ref> 

The chief of staff was assisted by an {{lang|fr|<U+00E9>tat-major-g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral}}, who ran the {{lang|fr|GQG}} general staff of around 50 officers and saw that the commander-in-chief's orders were carried out, and two aides-majors with responsibilities for the individual departments of GQG.<ref name=shd/><ref name=prete53>{{cite book|last=Prete|first=Roy A.|title=Strategy and Command: The Anglo-French Coalition on the Western Front, 1914|year=2009|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Montreal|isbn=978-0-7735-3522-0|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uAk3zxjAyO8C|page=53}}</ref> {{lang|fr|GQG}} was originally organised into four bureaus (or departments).  The First Bureau was responsible for organization, personnel and equipment; the Second Bureau for intelligence, information and political affairs; the Third Bureau for the planning of military operations and the Fourth Bureau (sometimes called the ''{{lang|fr|Direction de l'Arri<U+00E8>re}}'' - Directorate of the Rear [lines]) for transportation, communication and supply.<ref name=shd/><ref name=bourlet/>

The Third Bureau was considered by far the most powerful as it had control of active military operations.  Its staff consisted mainly of [[liaison officer]]s, embedded with individual unit headquarters.  Though these officers were junior in rank to the generals commanding the armies they held significant power over their careers through the reports made on their operations to {{lang|fr|GQG}}.  One officer from the Third Bureau was tasked as liaison to the French government and another to the president, they were said to wield "considerable political power".<ref name=prete54>{{cite book|last=Prete|first=Roy A.|title=Strategy and Command: The Anglo-French Coalition on the Western Front, 1914|year=2009|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Montreal|isbn=978-0-7735-3522-0|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uAk3zxjAyO8C|page=54}}</ref>  The Fourth Bureau had a wide remit, with responsibilities for the management of military railways, motor vehicles, water transport, financial offices, post offices and telegraphy and its chief was sometimes called the ''{{lang|fr|directeur de l'arri<U+00E8>re}}'' (director of the rear [lines]).<ref name=shd/>  In addition {{lang|fr|GQG}} was responsible for co-ordination with any allied armies.<ref name=prete53/>

=== Activation of GQG ===
[[File:Mobilisation order france 2 august 1914.JPG|thumb|A French poster declaring general mobilisation, published 2 August 1914]]
The French Chief of Staff, General [[Joseph Joffre]], was convinced of the inevitability of the outbreak of the [[First World War]] and, on 30 July 1914, began organising the personnel for his GQG staff.<ref name=king15>{{cite book|last=King|first=Jere Clemens|title=Generals & Politicians: Conflict Between France's High Command, Parliament, and Government, 1914<U+2013>1918|year=1951|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley & Los Angeles, USA|isbn=|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jd13Uw_ddH8C|page=15|OCLC=565328275}}</ref> Joffre persuaded the French government to enact mobilisation on 1 August and at 14.00 the next day parliament, following the violation of the French borders by German military patrols, gave Joffre full wartime powers and activated the {{lang|fr|GQG}}.<ref name=king15/> The zone of army control was initially limited to just 8 [[departments of France]], but on 10 August was expanded to 33 departments out of 86 in [[Metropolitan France]].<ref name=beckett157>{{cite book|last=Beckett|first=Ian Frederick William|title=The Great War: 1914<U+2013>1918|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Harlow, Cambridgeshire, UK|isbn=978-1-4058-1252-8|page=157|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CMYbKgcAW88C}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Rossiter|first=Clinton Lawrence|title=Constitutional Dictatorship: Crisis Government in the Modern Democracies|year=2009|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=Piscataway, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-7658-0975-9|page=92|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rsWXgBcTmbwC}}</ref> 

Upon activation the {{lang|fr|major-g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral}} of {{lang|fr|GQG}} was General [[Emile Belin]] and the two aides-majors were General [[Henri Berthelot]] and General [[C<U+00E9>leste Deprez]].

=== GQG during the war ===
[[File:6 september 1914 gqg joffre.jpg|thumb|A contemporary depiction of Joffre and his staff at the Ch<U+00E2>tillon-sur-Seine GQG on the night of 6 September 1914, during the First Battle of the Marne]]
GQG played a key role at the start of the war.  Due to illness Belin had delegated much of his role to Berthelot, further increasing the power of his influential Third Bureau.<ref name=prete53/>  The officers in that department, particularly the recent staff college graduates who were known as the [[Young Turks]], favoured strong offensive action.<ref name=prete54/>  They were key in persuading Joffre to attack the exposed German right flank during the [[Great Retreat]] from [[Mons]].<ref name=prete54/>  Joffre also used his new authority to exclude the press and his own government's parliamentary commission on military affairs from his zone of control.<ref name=beckett157/>  As a result of the German advances in late 1914 GQG was forced to relocate its headquarters progressively westwards.  It moved to [[Bar-sur-Aube]] on 31 August, [[Ch<U+00E2>tillon-sur-Seine]] on 6 September, [[Romilly-sur-Seine]] on 28 September 1914 and, on 29 November, to [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]], within the Paris metropolitan area, where it was to remain for the next few years.  This location was suited to GQG operations due to its proximity to the seat of government and the ministries in Paris.<ref name=shd/>

[[File:Romilly-sur-Seine - Plaque commemorating Joffre's medalling.jpg|thumb|left|A modern photograph of the GQG headquarters at Romilly-sur-Seine, a school, with plaque commemorating the awarding of the [[M<U+00E9>daille militaire]] to Joffre on 26 November 1914 by President [[Raymond Poincar<U+00E9>]]]]
Joffre found his new command difficult; while he was able to dismiss army commanders at will (he [[:wikt:limoger|limogered]] 54 generals by the time of the [[First Battle of the Marne]]) he seemed unable to remove officers from GQG.  The reasons for Joffre's lack of action are unknown but historian [[Alistair Horne]] speculated that it was due to the vast power granted to the GQG staff or to Joffre's desire not to be upstaged by his staff.  The GQG officers, isolated from the direct effects of the war, engaged in intrigue on a grand scale and there was little co-operation between the rival departments.  The Second Bureau maintained an inadequate means of calculating German casualty figures, simply assuming that for each two Frenchmen killed in battle three Germans must have fallen.  In reality the figures were almost the reverse.  By means of such estimations they calculated that Germany would run out of manpower reserves by early 1916.  Thus the Third Bureau found itself directing French generals to undertake military operations based on wholly inaccurate assessments of the strength of opposing units.<ref name=horne/>

French set-backs in 1915 forced Joffre to reorganise GQG<U+2014>on 11 December he replaced Belin with General [[No<U+00EB>l <U+00C9>douard, vicomte de Curi<U+00E8>res de Castelnau|No<U+00EB>l de Castelnau]]<U+2014>and expand its remit.<ref name=shd/><ref name=horne/>  Three entirely new bureaus were formed, that of the North Army ({{lang|fr|Arm<U+00E9>e du Nord}}), the North-East Army ({{lang|fr|Arm<U+00E9>e du Nord-Est}}) and for external theatres of war bringing GQG direct control of French armies in the field.  Two major-g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rals were appointed, General [[Maurice Janin]] for the two army bureaus and General [[Maurice Pell<U+00E9>]] for the Bureau for External Theatres of War.<ref name=shd/>  The Second Bureau was also reformed with its censorship, counter-espionage and intelligence gathering duties being passed to a new Fifth Bureau; though the Second Bureau retained some of its former intelligence responsibilities.<ref name=bourlet>{{cite journal|last=Bourlet|first=Micha<U+00EB>l|title=Des normaliens dans les services de renseignement du minist<U+00E8>re de la guerre (1914-1918)|journal=Revue Historique des Arm<U+00E9>es|year=2007|series=Le renseignement|issue=247|pages=31-41|url=http://rha.revues.org/index1823.html#ftn1|accessdate=17 March 2013|language=French|OCLC=1794161}}</ref> 

Despite this reorganisation GQG remained dysfunctional with the Second Bureau, described as "perennial optimists" by Horne, again responsible for providing deceptive assessments of German casualties, at one point in the [[Battle of Verdun]] simply adding "a hundred thousand or thereabouts" every fortnight to the figures.<ref name=horne/>  The confused responsibility for intelligence between the Second and Fifth Bureaus, the Ministry of the Interior and the police also led to delays in providing intelligence to the armies in the field during the battle.<ref name=antier>{{cite journal|last=Antier|first=Chantal|title=Espionnage et espionnes de la Grande Guerre|journal=Revue Historique des Arm<U+00E9>es|year=2007|series=Le renseignement|issue=247|pages=42-51|url=http://rha.revues.org/index1963.html|accessdate=17 March 2013|language=French|OCLC=1794161}}</ref>  The Third Bureau was responsible for withdrawing two and a half batteries of artillery from the fortresses of Verdun in the months leading up to that close-fought battle, despite receiving requests for reinforcements from the local commander General [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric-Georges Herr]], who stated he could not hold if attacked in force.<ref name=horne/>

[[File:Joffre and Haig at GQG 1916.jpg|thumb|Joffre and British General [[Douglas Haig]] inspecting French troops outside of GQG in Chantilly in 1916]]
The autonomy and power afforded to GQG worried Minister for War [[Joseph Gallieni]] and after his death, one of his successors, [[Hubert Lyautey]], ordered a reorganisation of GQG by ministerial decree on 13 December 1916.  Joffre was sidelined to a position as "technical adviser to the government", with few defined responsibilities, which led to his resignation on 27 December 1916 and replacement by General [[Robert Nivelle]].  Such was Joffre's fall from grace that, entitled to take three staff officers from GQG with him to his new post, he could find only one volunteer.<ref name=horne/>  The North Army and North-East Army were also removed from the direct control of GQG. This course of action was justified by the Ministry of War as an essential step in restoring the independence of the two armies, a key pre-war policy that had been established in a ministerial decree on 28 October 1913.<ref name=shd/> 

Nivelle ordered his own reorganisation on 1 January 1917, returning control of external theatres to the Ministry of War.<ref name=shd/>  In February the 2nd and 5th Bureaus were re-united, though there remained an informal division and intense rivalry between the officers of the "old" and "new" 2nd Bureau.  This division remained until the arrival of [[Georges Clemenceau]] as Prime Minister and Minister of War in November 1917.<ref name=bourlet/>

Nivelle moved the GQG headquarters forward to [[Beauvais]] in [[Picardy]] on 10 January and to [[Compi<U+00E8>gne]] in [[Oise]] on 4 April.  At this stage the GQG staff numbered 450 officers and 800 enlisted personnel.  However, the failure of the [[Nivelle Offensive]] of April 1917 led to his downfall and replacement by General [[Philippe P<U+00E9>tain]] on 17 May.  P<U+00E9>tain expanded GQG's operations, establishing a new Section for Relations with the Civil Authorities and a Bureau for Aeronatics, Telegraphy and Aviation.  He later reformed the Second Bureau, absorbing into it the newly formed section for relations with the civil authorities and a new responsibility for [[cryptography]].  A minor change in February 1918 saw the expansion of the Third Bureau, gaining telegraphy and liaison from the Bureau for Aeronautics and cryptography from the Bureau for Special Services.  In March the Bureau for Aeronautics gained control of [[anti-aircraft]] matters and the army medical departments under their own Bureau of Health Services.  This organisation would last until after the [[armistice with Germany]] in 1918.<ref name=shd/>

At 19.00 on 16 February 1918 the offices of the Third Bureau on Algiers Street in Compi<U+00E8>gne were hit by a bomb from a squadron of three German bombers.  Serious damage was caused to the building and two officers were killed, Commandant Mathis and Captain Mallet.  The dead officers were buried at the Saint-Jacques Church in Compi<U+00E8>gne.<ref>{{cite web|title=Journal de Marche de la Direction L'Arriere du GQG, Page 41|url=http://www.memoiredeshommes.sga.defense.gouv.fr/jmo/img-viewer/26_N_2_004/viewer.html|publisher=Secr<U+00E9>tariat G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral pour l'Administration|accessdate=27 January 2013|language=French}}</ref>  Fourteen additional officers were injured by flying glass, two of whom were hospitalised.<ref>{{cite web|title=Service de Sant<U+00E9> en Campagne - Grand Quartier G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral, Page 23|url=http://www.memoiredeshommes.sga.defense.gouv.fr/jmo/img-viewer/26_N_2_003/viewer.html|publisher=Secr<U+00E9>tariat G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral pour l'Administration|accessdate=27 January 2013|language=French}}</ref>

The {{lang|fr|GQG}} headquarters moved further eastwards to [[Provins]] in [[Seine-et-Marne]] on 26 March 1918.  After the armistice {{lang|fr|GQG}} moved to [[Metz]] in the newly reacquired [[Moselle]] department on 1 December 1918 and returned to Chantilly on 29 January 1919.  {{lang|fr|GQG}} was dissolved on 20 October 1919 in accordance with a request from the War Ministry on 14 October which also abolished the zone of army control.  The powers previously delegated to {{lang|fr|GQG}} were returned to the chief-of-staff of the army.  During the [[Second World War]] the German army took control of the {{lang|fr|GQG}} First World War archives and sent many of the most secret documents to Berlin for analysis.  These documents were recovered by the [[USSR]] at the [[End of World War II in Europe|end of the war]] and taken back to [[Moscow]] for processing.  They were not returned to France until after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in the 1990s.<ref name=shd/>
