The '''Church of World Messianity''' (<U+4E16><U+754C><U+6551><U+4E16><U+6559> ''Sekai ky<U+016B>sei ky<U+014D>'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]) is a so-called "new religion" ([[Shinshukyo]]) founded in [[1935]] by [[Mokichi Okada]] (1882-1955), a former staff member of [[Omoto-kyo]].  The religion's key concept is [[Johrei]], claimed to be a method of channeling divine light into the body of another for the purposes of [[healing]]. According to this religion, in 1926, Okada received a [[divine revelation]] and was empowered to be a channel of God's Healing Light (''johrei'') to remove illness, poverty, and strife from the world and inaugurate a new [[Messianic Age]]. Okada's teaching is represented by the scripture Johrei, which has been edited and translated by the Society of Johrei, an offshoot of Okada's movement. 

The religion currently claims 800,000 followers, including many in Brazil.

[[Sekai Mahikari Bunmei Kyodan]] founder Yoshikazu Okada (1901-1974) and [[Sukyo Mahikari]] founder Keishu Okada (1929- ) were both members of the Church of World Messianity prior to starting their own religions. 

According to a study by a religious anthropologist, Winston Davis (1980), it is clear the Mahikari groups are comparable to Church of World Messianity and follow basically the same healing ritual. <ref>{{harvnb|Winston, Davis|1980|p=75-76}}</ref>

== COWM in Brazil ==
Brazil has the largest concentration of Japanese outside of Japan. According to Hideaki Matsuoka, University of California, Berkeley, in a presentation at the Summer 2000 Asian Studies Conference Japan entitled "Messianity Makes the Person Useful: Describing Differences in a Japanese Religion in Brazil," new Japanese religions have propagated in Brazil since the 1930's and they now have at least a million non-Japanese Brazilian followers. Three major religions ranked by the number of followers are: [[Seicho-No-Ie]], Messianity, [[Mahikari]], and [[Perfect Liberty]]. Besides churches, these religions have their own sacred places around [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] state where their headquarters are typically located.

Matsuoka reports that there is a sharp contrast between these Japanese new religions' sacred places and those of other Brazilian religions in their size, structure, and symbolism. Compared to both Catholic churches and gathering places of Brazilian spiritism such as [[Umbanda]] and Kardecist [[Spiritism]], the sacred places of these new Japanese religions in Brazil are extensive. They look like small villages in the countryside; they have hills, creeks, and lodgings where pilgrims can stay. He opines that they may be considered theme parks full of religious symbols such as waterfalls, woods, and altars.

In Brazil, [[Guarapiranga]] is the sacred place of the Church of World Messianity (or Igreja Messi<U+00E2>nica Mundial).

==Other New Religious Movements==

[[Angeleno]]s may be familiar with the vintage [[neon sign]][http://www.publicartinla.com/neon_signs/superet_neon.html] of the [[Superet Light Church]] in the [[Mid-Wilshire]] district of [[Los Angeles]]. Such organizations offer<U+2014>often on a smaller scale<U+2014>some parallels to the Church of World Messianity in terms of [[spiritual healing]] practices using a form of "divine light", (see also [[Johrei]], [[Reiki]]),  and concern with global [[salvation]] and [[humanitarian]] causes. Interestingly, the Superet Light Church, whose literature also speaks of [[atom]]s and the [[aura]], was founded in 1925--around the same time as Okada's original revelation.

Such [[religious]], [[Spirituality|spiritual]], and [[occult]] movements, especially utilizing [[science|scientific]], (or [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]), terminology, may be considered as part of a global social phenomenon occurring in the "chaotic" era following the [[First World War]], and coinciding with liberal policies towards [[new religious movements]] in the [[U.S.]], [[Taisho]]- and [[Showa]]-era [[Japan]], and elsewhere.
