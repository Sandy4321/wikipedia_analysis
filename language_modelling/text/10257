The '''[[Slovakia|Slovak]] men's National [[Ice Hockey]] team''' is one of the major ice hockey powers in the world.  As of [[2007]], the International Ice Hocky Federation ([[IIHF]]), the world governing body of hockey, ranks them as the sixth best national team just ahead of the United States. The team is operated by the Slovak Ice Hockey Federation under general manager [[Peter <U+0160><U+0165>astn<U+00FD>]], and head coach J<U+00FA>lius <U+0160>upler. In the last six years, Slovakia has won three medals at the World Championships including a gold medal in [[2002]]. Slovakia has a total of 12,375 hockey players (0.23% of its population). 

The Slovak national team was formed following the breakup of [[Czechoslovakia]], as the country was split into the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]. For years, the Czechs kept control over how the national team was run, and even had quotas instituted to ensure a minimal participation of Slovak players on the Czechoslovakian national team.  While the Czechs were allowed to compete at the highest pool (A), the IIHF ruled that because fewer players of the former [[Czechoslovak national ice hockey team|Czechoslovak]] team were Slovaks, Slovakia would be required to start international play in
pool C.  However, Slovakia's play in the lower pools won it promotion to pool A by [[1996]]. ''See also [[Ice Hockey World Championships#Post-Cold War|Post-Cold War]] period of the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|IIHF world championships]] ''.

In the 2002 Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, the Slovak team was unable to use its NHL players in the preliminary round due to a scheduling conflict.  This effected all of the smaller countries, but devasted the Slovak team as most of their players were coming from NHL teams.  The NHL had decided to only allow their players to participate in the final medal round, and thus Slovakia failed to qualify finishing a disappointing 13th.  This turn of events was troubling to the entire hockey community, and the rules were changed for the 2006 Winter games in Torino. 

Notable Slovak national team members and current NHL players include [[Pavol Demitra]] and of [[Mari<U+00E1>n G<U+00E1>bor<U+00ED>k]] the Minnesota Wild, brothers [[Mari<U+00E1>n Hossa]] and [[Marcel Hossa]], [[Miroslav <U+0160>atan]], and the tallest player in hockey history [[Zdeno Ch<U+00E1>ra]].  In the late 1990's, the St. Louis Blues placed [[<U+013D>ubo<U+0161> Barte<U+010D>ko]], [[Michal Handzu<U+0161>]], and Demitra on the same line.  This trio became known as the "Slovak Pack," and were able to communicate in their native language without the opposition knowing what they were saying.
