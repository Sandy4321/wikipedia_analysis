"'''Pilot'''" is the series premiere of the American television series ''[[Nikita (TV series)|Nikita]]''. It premiered in the United States on [[The CW Television Network]] on September 9, 2010. The episode was written by series creator Craig Silverstein and directed by [[Danny Cannon]]. 

This episode introduces the series' main characters and the motivation behind the title character [[Nikita (Nikita character)|Nikita]]'s mission to bring down a secret agency in the government called Division. "Pilot" received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It was watched by 3.6 million viewers and earned a 1.9 rating for women 18-34, matching the CW's highest rating ever in the Thursday 9:00pm timeslot and drawing the largest audience that the CW had had in over a year and a half.

==Plot==
After escaping from a secret unit of the government known as Division three years ago, [[Nikita (Nikita character)|Nikita]] ([[Maggie Q]]) suddenly resurfaces when she visits her abusive foster father and tells him what happened to her after she had run away from his house as a teenager. She became addicted to drugs, and six years ago, she reportedly killed a police officer, though she cannot remember whether she did so or not. She was sentenced to death, but Division faked her execution and trained her to be an assassin. However, she broke one of their rules by falling in love with a civilian, Daniel Monroe. Division had Daniel killed in what appeared to be an accident, and this prompted Nikita to escape. Nikita explains all of this to her foster father, knowing full well that doing so would alert Division to her presence.

Meanwhile, in [[Detroit]], [[Alexandra (Nikita character)|Alex]] ([[Lyndsy Fonseca]]) is captured by the police during a failed robbery, while her accomplice escapes. Shortly after being brought to prison, Alex wakes up to find herself inside Division. [[Michael (Nikita character)|Michael]] ([[Shane West]]), Division's second-in-command, informs Alex that they have faked her death and that she is being offered a second chance - an opportunity to serve her government. She soon meets two other recruits, Thom ([[Ashton Holmes]]) and Jaden ([[Tiffany Hines]]), as well as Amanda ([[Melinda Clarke]]), Division's psychologist who also assists in training the recruits. Amanda guesses correctly that Alex had been smuggled to the US after being sold to human traffickers in Ukraine.

Percy ([[Xander Berkeley]]), the head of Division gets wind of Nikita's reemergence and assigns Michael to kill her. Nikita once again gets Division's attention by visiting Daniel's grave. A strike team is sent to go after her, but, during the attack, Nikita captures Birkhoff ([[Aaron Stanford]]), Division's head technician. She demands that he give her access to Division's computer network. Even though he doesn't comply, she lets Birkhoff return to Division unharmed. 

In spite of Nikita, Percy decides to go ahead with all of Division's operations, including Operation Black Arrow, in which the head of a West African nation is targeted for assassination. Nikita learns about Black Arrow from an unknown source and sabotages the mission. Nikita then comes face-to-face with Percy and Michael at a government fundraiser and tells Percy of her intentions to destroy Division. Michael chases her out of the building and has the opportunity to kill her, but he hesitates. He tells Nikita that Percy cannot be stopped because he has evidence of every illegal Division operation ever done and that this information would irreparably damage the US government. Michael decides to let Nikita escape, but she shoots him in the shoulder before running off, claiming that she is protecting him since the wound would make it look like he tried to stop her.

Percy immediately names Nikita Division's priority target and believes that she is working with someone who is giving her information on Division's operations. It is revealed that Alex is Nikita's source inside Division and that Nikita was Alex's accomplice during the robbery that resulted in Alex's recruitment into Division.
