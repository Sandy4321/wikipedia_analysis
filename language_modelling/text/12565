The '''Kapampangans''' or '''Capampa<U+00F1>gans''' ([[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]]: ''pampangos'' or ''pampangue<U+00F1>os''<!--Spanish does not capitalize names of ethnic groups-->) are the eighth largest [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|Filipino ethnic group]], numbering at about 2,890,000. Kapampangans are descended from [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]]-speaking immigrants to the Philippines during the [[Iron Age]]. They primarily live in the provinces of [[Pampanga]] and [[Tarlac]], as well as in the provinces of [[Nueva Ecija]], [[Bataan]], [[Bulacan]], and [[Zambales]].  To this day, the Kapampangans or Pampangans  are the dominant ethnic group in Central Luzon.

A little history of Pampanga shows that the Kapampangans take pride in their province for being one of the eight provinces in the country to revolt against Spain and having produced two presidents, three chief justices, a senate president, the first Filipino cardinal and many outstanding personalities in public service, education, diplomacy, journalism, the arts and sciences, entertainment and business. 

==History==
Legend has it that the Kapampangans were descended from a [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] princess who came to settle in the region now known as [[Pampanga]]. Before the arrival of the Spaniards in the late 16th century, the Kapampangan people made up the bulk of the population of what the Ming Dynasty texts referred to as the Kingdom of Lusong (<U+5442><U+5B8B><U+570B>). They were known to be traders and explorers. They penetrated the Chinese market at a time when the Ming Dynasty banned all foreign trade and so profited immensely from it. Although [[16th century]] Kapampangan society reflected most of what was prevalent in Southeast Asia ~ small communities made up chiefly of the same clans ruled by a council of elders ~ certain communities rose up to become centers of trade and power. Noted among these is the ancient state of Tungdo (<U+6771><U+90FD>) or "the Eastern Capital" and Betis. 

Extensive farming and fishing were the main industries of the Kapampangan people. But at the height of Lusong's importance in the China trade in the 16th century, maritime trading, and perhaps even piracy, became the main source of profit. As one of the Lu<U+00E7><U+00F5>es (people of Lusong), many Kapampangans worked as mercenaries for the various states and kingdoms in Southeast Asia. Lusong became such an important center in Chinese trade that the Kingdom of [[Brunei]] was forced to invade it in 1500. The city of [[Manila]] was created by the Burneians to oversee the trade in Brunei's interest. [[Japan]]ese records show that important traders like Luzon Sukezaemon and Shimai Soshitsu opened up shop in Lusong. At a time when the Ming Dynasty banned its citizens from going out of China, the Kapampangan traders from Lusong who brought Chinese goods all across Southeast Asia were thought of as Chinese. 

The Kapampangan people sense of [[ethnocentrism|self-importance]] must have risen in direct proportion to Lusong's growth and rise to prominence in the 16th century China trade. This development might have helped shape the Kapampangan people's attitude and the way that they were perceived historically by [[Ethnic groups of the Philippines|other ethnic groups]].

==Culture, language, and identity==
[[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]], a member of the Meso-Philippine group of the Western Malayo-Polynesian languages, is the ethnic language of the Kapampangans. However, many Kapampangans in other parts of the Philippines, especially large urban areas like [[Metro Manila]] and [[Metro Cebu]], neither speak nor understand Kapampangan, and, even in traditionally Kapampangan-speaking areas, the use of Kapampangan is in decline.<ref>In many gatherings Kapampangans seem more confident and articulate in exchanging views and ideas among their own K[abalen] <U+2018>countrymen<U+2019> ... in Tagalog than they would in their own [mother tongue]. For instance, many Catholic priests are now delivering their homilies in the Tagalog language during a Kapampangan liturgy while high school student meetings are conducted in the Tagalog language even if all the participants are Kapampangans. http://www.silinternational.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers/pangilinan-Dispute%20on%20Orthography.pdf</ref> Despite this, Kapampangans retain a strong, indomitable sense of identity and ethnic pride (often bordering on [[ethnocentrism]]), regardless of the native language of each Kapampangan family or individual. Kapampangan cuisine is widely thought to be among the most evolved and refined of [[Philippine cuisine]]s. Some popular Kapampangan dishes enjoyed all over the Philippines across ethnic boundaries include [[kare-kare]], [[sisig]], and [[kilawin]].

==Religion==
Most (not all) Kapampangans are extremely devout to the [[Roman Catholic|Roman Catholic faith]].  Every town within [[Pampanga]] has at least one church and several small chapels.   There are at least 26 churches all throughout the province.  Religious holidays such as Holy Week, Christmas, the feast of St. John the Baptist and Apung Iru Fluvial Parade are highly celebrated festivals often visited by local and international tourists.

Many Kapampangans are [[Roman Catholic]]s, [[Ang Dating Daan]] Members, and some are [[Protestant]]s. Very few are [[Buddhists]].Vaishnavas (or Worshippers of Krishna or Vishnu)have been slowly but surely increasing in number since the 70's.
