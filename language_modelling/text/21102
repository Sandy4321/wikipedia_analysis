'''Jeremiah G. Hamilton''' was a Wall Street [[broker]] noted as "the only [[Black people|black]] millionaire in New York" around the time of the [[American Civil War]]. Hamilton was a shrewd financial agent, amassing a fortune of $2 million<U+2014>over $250 million [[Inflation adjustment|in 2013 dollars]]<U+2014>by the time of his death in 1875.  Although he was the subject of much newspaper coverage and his life provides a unique perspective on [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|race]] in 19th century America, Hamilton is virtually absent from modern historical literature.<ref name="NYTimes_2013-07-25">{{cite news | title=Gotham<U+2019>s Only Black Millionaire | last=White | first=Shane | date=July 25, 2013 | accessdate=July 27, 2013 | publisher=The New York Times|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/25/gothams-only-black-millionaire/}}</ref>

Hamilton first came to prominence in 1828 after escaping [[Haiti|Haitian]] authorities who had discovered he was transporting counterfeit coins to Haiti for a group of New York merchants.  Almost a decade later, after the 1835 [[Great Fire of New York]] destroyed most of the buildings on the southeast tip of [[Manhattan]], Hamilton accrued about $5 million in 2013 dollars by "taking pitiless advantage of several of the fire victims' misfortunes".<ref name="NYTimes_2013-07-25"/>  Soon thereafter, he used about $7 million in 2013 dollars to buy up a substantial amount of land and property in modern-day [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]] and [[Poughkeepsie]].  Hamilton would go on to struggle with [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], the famous American industrialist, over control of the [[Nicaragua Transit Company]].

Although he circulated among the financial elite and was himself very wealthy, Hamilton was also the object of [[racism]] against [[African-American]]s that was pervasive during his time.  During the [[New York City draft riots]] in 1863, white men seeking to [[Lynching|lynch]] Hamilton broke into his house, but were turned away by his wife Eliza after she said her husband was not home.  While Eliza Hamilton was [[White people|white]]<U+2014>making her marriage to Jeremiah very [[taboo]] for the time<U+2014>she was also said to be the daughter of [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]],<ref name="NYTimes_2013-07-25"/> a US Senator from Pennsylvania and signer of the [[Declaration of Independence]].

At the time of his death in May 1875, Jeremiah Hamilton was said by obituaries to be the richest black man in the United States.  He is buried in his family lot in the [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn]].<ref name="NYTimes_2013-07-25"/>
