}}The 1997 Australian [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] premiership (known as the '''[[Telstra]] Cup''' for sponsorship purposes) was contested by ten clubs. It was the 90th season of professional [[rugby league football]] in Australia and the only top grade competition to be run by the [[News Limited]]-controlled Super League. 

Compared to the rival [[Australian Rugby League season 1997|Australian Rugby League competition]] being run at the same time, there were just three teams based in [[Sydney]]. A further team from greater [[New South Wales]], two teams from [[Queensland]], one from the [[Australian Capital Territory]], one from [[South Australia]], one from [[Western Australia]] and one from [[New Zealand]] made up the premiership.

==Background==
{{Main|Super League (Australia)}}
'''Super League''' was a [[rugby league]] competition that was held in Australia in [[1997]]. It was created by [[News Corporation]] after an unsuccessful attempt to purchase the pay television rights to Australian rugby league games. After two years of legal battles the competition was played for a single season in 1997 before merging with the rival [[Australian Rugby League]] competition in [[1998]] to form the [[National Rugby League]].

==Season Summary==
The Telstra Cup premiership was held over eighteen rounds. The season was dominated by the minor premiers, the [[Brisbane Broncos]], who won 14 of their 18 matches, losing only to the [[Penrith Panthers]], the [[Hunter Mariners]] and eventual runners-up, the [[Cronulla Sharks]]. The [[Brisbane Broncos 1997#1997 Grand Final|Grand Final]] was played at [[Brisbane]]'s [[Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre|ANZ Stadium]] in front of 58,000 people; the ground record for that venue. The Broncos defeated the Sharks 26-8 to win their third premiership. The [[Auckland Warriors]] had teams in both the reserve grade and two age-group Grand Finals but lost all three.

The winners in all grades were:
* First Grade: Brisbane Broncos
* Reserve Grade: Canterbury Bulldogs
* Under-19s: Penrith Panthers
* Under-17s: Brisbane Broncos

===Advertising===
Teaser ads had been created by Mojo Sydney in 1996 around the theme of "Superleague: It's Coming". They featured Super League players performing superhuman feats. One notable execution included Canberra's [[Bradley Clyde]] inside a rodeo corral being stormed by a runaway bull with the suggestion that he is about to singlehandedly bring the bull to ground.

By season launch in 1997 Foxtel's ad agency Young and Rubicam Sydney had the Super League account and created a space-themed ad with players running through outer-space and the tag-line "Super League: It's out of this world".

By mid season the account had moved again and Sydney agency VCD produced much of the game promotional and club fixture print ads that ran in newspapers throughout the season. This commenced VCD's association with Super League that would continue with the ARL post the re-unification.

|}Despite rain, a record crowd in Queensland rugby league history was at [[Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre|ANZ Stadium]] for the first ever night grand final and the only Australian top level grand final to be played outside Sydney. The match crowned a week of grand final festivities, including a ball, street parade and massive game-night fireworks display, of the sort the Broncos' management had wanted the ARL to bring to Brisbane before the code's big schism in 1995. [[Jon Stevens]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]] also performed in the pre-match entertainment.

[[Image:1997_super_league_grand_final_ticket.jpg|left|thumb|A ticket for the 1997 Super League Telstra Cup Grand Final.]]The talented Brisbane side, featuring young up-and-coming stars in [[Darren Lockyer]], [[Gorden Tallis]] and [[Shane Webcke]] overwhelmed a game Cronulla side 26<U+2013>8. [[Steve Renouf]], became only the third man to score three tries in a grand final. The win kept the Broncos' 100% record intact in Grand Finals making it three from three, while the Sharks had yet to make a grand final victory with zero from three.

==National Rugby League==
{{Main|National Rugby League}}
With twenty-two teams playing in two competitions in 1997 crowd attendances and corporate sponsorships were spread very thinly, and many teams found themselves in financial difficulty by the end of the season. On [[September 23]], [[1997]] the [[Australian Rugby League|ARL]] announced that it was forming a new company to control the competition in 1998 and invited Super League clubs to participate. On [[October 7]] [[Rupert Murdoch]] announced that he was confident that there would be a single competition in 1998 and in the following months the National Rugby League, jointly owned by the [[Australian Rugby League|ARL]] and News Limited, was formed.
