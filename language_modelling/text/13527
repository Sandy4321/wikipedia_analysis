'''Virginia State Route 89''' (SR 89) is a primary [[state highway]] in the U.S. state of [[Virginia]].  The state highway runs {{convert|7.85|mi|km}} from the [[North Carolina]] state line, where the highway continues as [[North Carolina Highway 89]] (NC 89), north to [[U.S. Route 58]] and [[U.S. Route 221 in Virginia|US 221]] in [[Galax, Virginia|Galax]].

==Route description==
SR 89 begins at the North Carolina state line a short distance south of Low Gap, where the highway crosses the [[Eastern Continental Divide]].  The highway continues south as NC 89, which descends the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] to the community of [[Lowgap, North Carolina|Lowgap]] in the valley of the [[Fisher River (North Carolina)|Fisher River]].  After entering the watershed of the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]], SR 89 crosses the West Fork of [[Chestnut Creek]] and has an interchange with the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]], which provides access to the [[Blue Ridge Music Center]] to the east.  North of the parkway, the state highway intersects SR 613 (Edmonds Road), which leads west to [[Big Spring Bog Natural Area Preserve]].  SR 89 heads straight north as Skyline Highway to McCarmant Hill, where the highway leaves [[Grayson County, Virginia|Grayson County]] and enters the [[independent city]] of Galax as Main Street.  The state highway crosses Chestnut Creek twice before meeting the western end of [[Virginia State Route 97|SR 97]] (Pipers Gap Road).  SR 89 heads through downtown Galax before reaching its northern terminus at US 58 and US 221 (Stuart Drive).<ref name="VDOT Traffic Data"/><ref name="Google Maps VA 89"/>

==History==
The whole route was added to the state highway system in 1928 as '''State Route 117'''.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.virginiadot.org/meetings/minutes_pdf/CTB-09-1928-01.pdf Minutes of the Meeting of the State Highway Commission of Virginia Held in Richmond, Virginia, September 27, 1928]|409&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 419678 bytes -->}}, page 10</ref> It was renumbered '''State Route 96''' in the [[1933 renumbering (Virginia)|1933 renumbering]], and in the [[1940 renumbering (Virginia)|1940 renumbering]] it was renumbered '''State Route 89''' to match [[North Carolina Highway 89]].<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.virginiadot.org/meetings/minutes_pdf/CTB-10-1940-01.pdf Minutes of the Meeting of the State Highway Commission of Virginia, Held in Richmond, October 10, 1940]|332&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 340879 bytes -->}}, page 13</ref>
