==History==
===Founding Fathers===
<U+0392><U+03A5><U+03A7> was founded at the University of Texas in 1985 by the national founding fathers, with Wendel Weaver being the first president (Today he sits on the National Board of Directors). This pioneering group of men saw the lasting bonds of deep friendship that [[fraternities and sororities|Greek life]] fostered and felt that such an order, dedicated to [[Christ]] and the edification of one another, could lead to a powerful social witness on their campus.  Thus, as an alternative to what was seen as the "normal" [[fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] scene, the Founding Fathers of Beta Upsilon Chi established their Fraternity as '''Brothers Under Christ''', and took the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letters [[Beta (letter)|Beta]], [[Upsilon]], and [[Chi]] to identify themselves to the world. They chose to make public their true name, Brothers Under Christ, so that they might always wear the name of [[Christ]] and demonstrate that one could remain true to one's faith and yet enjoy life in fellowship with others.<ref name="about"/> To announce the founding of their Fraternity, the Founding Fathers organized the first [[Island Party]] on the campus of the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]]. Chapters around the country now hold their own Island Party annually as an evangelical outreach to the chapters' respective campuses and communities.<ref name="chapter_list"/>

===Going national===
The process of growing from one chapter in [[Austin, Texas]] to a national organization across the country was slow at first.  Initially, the alpha chapter rejected requests from Christian men at other schools to be [[Fraternities and sororities#Joining a fraternity or sorority|initiated]] into the Fraternity or to start new [[chapter]]s.

Eventually, the leadership in Austin decided that this success of Beta Upsilon Chi should be shared with other campuses, and the Founding Fathers of Beta Chapter were initiated at [[Texas Christian University]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].  The fraternity then expanded its presence across Texas starting the Gamma and Delta chapters at [[Texas A&M University]] and [[Stephen F. Austin State University]].<ref name="chapter_list"/>

Today, the national fraternity is headquartered in Fort Worth, and an expansion program oversees the establishment of new chapters.<ref name="contact">"[http://www.brothersunderchrist.org/display.php?document=contact Contact]."

===Inspiration for new fraternities===
The influence of Beta Upsilon Chi on the [[Christian fraternity]] movement has been significant. In [[1988]], only three years after its founding, women from [[University of Texas at Austin|Texas]] established [[Sigma Phi Lambda]], or '''Sisters for the Lord'''.<ref name="SFL">"[http://www.sigma-phi-lambda.com/All%20About%20Phi%20Lamb.htm All About Sigma Phi Lambda]." ''[http://www.sigma-phi-lambda.com/ Sigma Phi Lambda].''

''History of Beta Upsilon Chi, 1985-2000.'' Fort Worth, Texas: Beta Upsilon Chi Fraternity, [[2000]].</ref> This women's Christian sorority is considered by many, but certainly not all, to be BYX's sister sorority. Their official name, '''Sisters for the Lord''', and their system of "cable groups" closely mirrors BYX.<ref name="SFL"/>

===Continued growth and new chapters===
[[Image:Vanderbilt_Homecoming_2003.jpg|thumb|right|265px|BYX brothers are active in the life of the universities they call home. Here, [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]] Nu alum Todd Dahmann is crowned Homecoming King in 2003.]]
As a [[Christian fraternity|Christian social fraternity]], BYX seeks both to edify college men through [[Bible]] study, worship, and outreach and to promote brotherhood and friendship among its members.

With twenty-one chapters across the country, BYX is the largest [[Christian fraternity|Christian social fraternity]] in the United States,<ref name="chapter_list"/> and it looks to continue to grow, as Christian men at other campuses continue to learn about the organization and petition to start new chapters through the [[Beta Upsilon Chi#Prospective chapters|BYX Expansion Process]] (see below).

BYX chapters continue to do well despite declines in other areas of Greek life: at [[Vanderbilt University]], Nu Chapter led all fraternities in [[pledge]]s for the second year in [[Spring (season)|Spring]] [[2006]].<ref name="vand_hustler">"Fraternity recruitment decreases slightly." ''The Vanderbilt Hustler,'' Vol. 123, May 7, 2006, p. 1, col. 1.</ref>

===UGA controversy===
In late 2006, the Pi Chapter of Beta Upsilon Chi at the [[University of Georgia]] was prevented from registering as a student organization by University officials "because the group requires its members and officers to share the group<U+2019>s Christian beliefs."<ref>Staff Writer. "[http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/news/story.aspx?cid=3938 University of Georgia: No religious fraternities]." ''[[Alliance Defense Fund]].'' [[December 5]], [[2006]]. Retrieved on [[April 2]], [[2007]].</ref>

After months of negotiation between University officials, student officers of the local chapter, and officials at the Fraternity's national headquarters in Texas, attorneys with the [[Christian Legal Society]] and [[Alliance Defense Fund]] filed a civil rights suit on [[December 5]], [[2006]] in [[United States District Court|federal court]] against the [[University of Georgia|University]] on behalf of the Fraternity.<ref>"[http://www.telladf.org/UserDocs/BYXcomplaint.pdf ''Beta Upsilon Chi v. Michael F. Adams'']." ''[[United States District Court]].'' [[December 5]], [[2006]].</ref>

On December 10, published reports by the [[Associated Press]] indicated that the University [would] "remove the religion clause from the [University's anti-discrimination] policy for the Christian fraternity to settle this particular situation and is discussing 'an exception to religious discrimination (that) could be put into place much like an exception to gender discrimination is in place for same-sex social fraternities and sororities.'<ref>The Associated Press.

Retrieved on [[April 4]], [[2007]].</ref>

==Organization==
===Board of Directors===
At the national level, <U+0392><U+03A5><U+03A7> is headed by a [[Board of Directors]]. This board is the ultimate authority and is responsible for the guidance of the [[fraternities and sororities|fraternity]]. 

The Board comprises the governing body of the Beta Upsilon Chi corporation, a 501(c)(3) organization, which controls the assets of the fraternity.  They appoint the National [[Executive Director]] to run the daily business of the Fraternity.  In conjunction with this Executive Director, they approve any [[charter]] changes. 

All members of the Board must be alumnus members of the Fraternity.  The National Executive Director is an ''ex officio'' member of the Board of Directors; he has a voice in decisions, but no vote.

The current members of the National Board of Directors are Wendel Weaver (Chairman), Chuck James, John Sherman, Kyle Hoover, and Brett Williams.<ref name="about"/>

===Executive Director===
[[Image:jhoyt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The current national Executive Director of BYX is [[Texas A&M University|Texas A&M]] Gamma alum '''Jason Hoyt'''.]]
The BYX Executive Director is the national administrator of the Fraternity.  Through his staff, he coordinates the activities of the Fraternity from its headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas.

The Executive Director's staff is equally responsible for the day-to-day operation of the national fraternity, and staff from National Headquarters frequently visit the chapters.

The following men have served as Executive Director of Beta Upsilon Chi<ref>Hoyt, Jason.  "Executive Director's Report."  ''Beta Upsilon Chi National Newsletter.''  July 2005.</ref>:

* Kyle Hoover, 1999&ndash;2001
* Kevin Peck, 2001&ndash;2004
* Jason Hoyt, 2004&ndash;Present<ref name="hoyt">"[http://www.brothersunderchrist.org/display.php?submenu=about&document=executivedirector Executive Director: Jason Hoyt]." ''Brothers Under Christ (website).'' Retrieved on [[April 2]], [[2007]].</ref>

===Chapter governance===
Chapters are authorized by a [[Charter]] from the National Board of Directors and denominated by a letter of the [[Greek alphabet]] that corresponds with their order of admission into the Fraternity (for example, the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] is [[Alpha]] Chapter.<ref name="chapter_list"/>

The Charter authorizes each chapter to work under a Chapter [[Constitution]] that provides for the election of chapter officers: [[president]], [[vice president]], [[secretary]], [[treasurer]], [[chaplain]], and [[Fraternities and sororities#Joining a fraternity or sorority|pledge trainer]].<ref>"[http://www.baylorbyx.com/main/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=22&Itemid=35 Contact Us]." ''Baylor Chapter (website).'' Retrieved on [[April 6]], [[2007]].</ref><ref>"[http://www.byx.tcu.edu/index.asp Officers]." ''Texas Christian Chapter (website).'' Retrieved on [[April 6]], [[2007]].</ref><ref>"[http://utbyx.moonfruit.com/ Officers]." ''Texas Chapter (website).'' Retrieved on [[April 6]], [[2007]].</ref>
These [[wikt:officer|officer]]s are responsible for the administration of the Chapter for a [[calendar year]], conducting [[ritual]], overseeing meetings, organizing trips, implementing the pledging program, organizing parties, etc.  The officers serve one year terms, and may only be re-elected once to a different office.

===National meetings===
Once each year, the chapter officers gather together for a National Leadership Conference, which consists of all the officers of the Fraternity and the national staff. This meeting is in the fall, and shortly follows the election of the local chapter leaders.<ref name="conference">"[http://www.brothersunderchrist.org/display.php?document=announcements&id=21 Next Leaders Conference]." ''Brothers Under Christ (website).'' Retrieved on [[April 2]], [[2007]].</ref>

In the early spring of each year, the entire Fraternity is called together for National Summit, held outside of [[Dallas, Texas]].  The event is the primary unifying experience of BYX members outside of their common commitment to Christ and their shared experience in ritual and ceremony of the Fraternity.  Its Bible studies, worship, fellowship, athletic competitions, and seminars on Fraternity issues attract the largest gatherings of Brothers Under Christ in any given year. It is also at Summit where the annual Delegate Convention of the Fraternity takes place.<ref name="national_summit">"[http://www.brothersunderchrist.org/display.php?document=events&id=84 National Summit Conference]." ''Brothers Under Christ.'' Retrieved on [[April 2]], [[2007]].</ref>

===Affiliating with local universities===
Since its inception in 1985, chapters of Beta Upsilon Chi have chosen not to affiliate with the Interfraternity Council (IFC) at the school where they are established.

This has proven controversial on some campuses, because it means that BYX does not pay IFC dues.  On the other hand, IFC membership sometimes involves sanctioning rules and regulations which would be contrary to the purpose of BYX.  Because of the potential for conflict inherent in such affiliations, the National Board of Directors continues to uphold a policy prohibiting local chapters from affiliating with host university IFCs.

At the same time, at some campuses where BYX is established, the local IFC prohibits BYX from affiliating because the National Fraternity is not a member of the [[North-American Interfraternity Conference]], the national group that oversees IFCs on campuses throughout [[North America]].<ref name="general">"[http://www.brothersunderchrist.org/docs/phase1-07.pdf General Information]." ''Beta Upsilon Chi.'' Retrieved on [[April 2]], [[2007]].</ref>

Despite questions about organization and university structure, BYX continues to be an integral part of Greek life on the campuses where its Chapters have been established.

==Membership==
[[Image:BYX_Miss_State_Omicron_Tailgate.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Founding Fathers from [[Mississippi State University|Mississippi State's]] Omicron Chapter at a BYX tailgate.]]There are three kinds of membership in the Fraternity: [[pledge]]s, active members, and [[alumni]] members.  Each local chapter is composed of its active members and pledges.

Active members form the backbone of the Fraternity, participating in ritual, leading [[worship]], [[Bible]] study, and other chapter activities.  Active members have voting rights within the chapter and become alumni members upon their [[graduation]].  Pledges become members by finishing the pledging process, a process that differs from chapter to chapter.

===Cell groups===
As Christian fraternities have proliferated across the country and into college campuses throughout the United States, there have been those who have questioned what makes each fraternity different.  BYX has continued to grow rapidly -- sustaining itself as the largest Christian fraternity in the U.S. -- by holding firmly to the traditions that have caused it to stand out from among the local and national fraternities vying for resources and interest among Christian men in college.

The attribute of BYX chapters that most clearly delineates it from other Christian fraternities -- and certainly from non-Christian social fraternities -- is that all BYX members are a part of "'''cell groups'''."<ref name="general"/> These weekly meetings bring four to six brothers (and pledges, when there are pledges) together into a group for close fellowship, Christian accountability, and Bible study.  Many times, brothers in Beta Upsilon Chi find that those with whom they share their cell group become their closest friends within the chapter and within their college.

The overall strength of the Fraternity's national and local unity is firmly rooted in this cell group structure, and their foundational place within Beta Upsilon Chi (cell groups were an original innovation of the Founding Fathers when they established the Fraternity at the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]]) has led to its continued growth and longevity.  Indeed, cell groups are one of the primary means by which the Fraternity's Christian character is maintained.<ref name="report2005">Hoyt, Jason.  "Executive Director's Report."  ''Beta Upsilon Chi National Newsletter.'' July 2005.</ref>

==Traditions and symbols==
[[Image:BYX_Texas_Alpha_Island_Party.jpg|thumb|right|350px|All BYX chapters hold an '''Island Party''' each spring, celebrating its founding and sharing Christ through entertainment.  Here, the [[Texas State Capitol]] dome is a backdrop to IP at [[University of Texas at Austin|Texas]] Alpha.]] 
As with any Greek letter organization, Beta Upsilon Chi is a ritualistic organization whose pledge induction, initiation, and other ceremonies are esoteric and not open to the general public.  Instead, these traditions serve to bind the brothers together such that any Brother Under Christ from across the country can feel welcome and among his brothers.

In addition to the usual Greek practices of grips, words, and memory work, Beta Upsilon Chi also utilizes several symbols whose meaning is open to anyone:

* '''Founding Scripture.''' "Behold, how good and how pleasing it is when Brothers to dwell together in Unity!" --[http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_%28American_Standard%29/Psalms#Chapter_133 Psalm 133:1]<ref name="about"/>

* '''Colors.'''  [[Purple]] and [[white]].<ref name="about"/>

* '''Coat of arms.'''  Each part on the crest has a meaning. The crown at the top is the Crown of Jesus, the Prince of Peace, the King of Kings. The purple and white fields are the fraternity's colors. The royal purple represents our heritage as sons of God. The white field symbolizes the purity we have through Christ's blood. The three-stranded cord, as the Bible teaches, cannot be broken. It represents unity and the Trinity of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. The communion chalice and wafer represent the blood and body of Christ. The cross depicts Christ's sacrifice for our salvation. The dove represents peace and the Holy Spirit.<ref name="about"/>

* '''Signature event.'''  [[Island Party]]

The rest of the Fraternity's traditions and symbols are closely guarded by the members of the Fraternity, whose oaths and duty compel them to maintain the secrecy that has kept BYX unique in Greek life.
