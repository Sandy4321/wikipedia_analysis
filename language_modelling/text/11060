'''Maurice Robert "Mike" Gravel''' ({{pronEng|<U+0261>r<U+0259><U+02C8>v<U+025B>l}}) (born [[May 13]], [[1930]]) is a former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Alaska]] who served two terms from 1969 to 1981, and is a candidate for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nomination in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]].

Born and raised in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] to [[French-Canadian]] immigrant parents, Gravel served in the [[United States Army]] in [[West Germany]] and graduated from [[Columbia University]].  He moved to Alaska in the late 1950s, becoming a [[real estate]] developer and entering politics.  He served in the [[Alaska House of Representatives]] from 1963 to 1966 and became its Speaker of the House.  Gravel was elected to the United States Senate in 1968.

As Senator, Gravel became nationally known for his forceful but unsuccessful attempts to end [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]] during the [[Vietnam War]] and for having put the [[Pentagon Papers]] into the public record in 1971 despite risk to himself. He conducted an unusual campaign for the Democratic nomination for [[Vice President of the United States]] in 1972, and then played a crucial role in getting Congressional approval for the [[Trans-Alaska pipeline]] in 1973.  He was re-elected to the Senate in 1974, but gradually alienated most of his Alaskan constituencies and his bid for a third term was defeated in a Democratic primary election in 1980.  

Gravel returned to business ventures and went through difficult times, suffering corporate and personal bankruptcies amidst poor health.  He became a passionate advocate of [[direct democracy]] and the [[National Initiative]], and in 2006 began a run for [[President of the United States]] in part to promote those ideas.  His campaign gained an Internet following and national attention from forceful and idiosyncratic debate appearances during 2007, but has consistently shown very little support in national polls.

==Early life, military service, education==
Gravel was born in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] to [[French-Canadian]] [[immigrant]] parents, Marie Bourassa and Alphonse Gravel,<ref>{{cite web| last =Battle| first =Robert| title =The Ancestors of Mike Gravel| publisher =WARGS.com| url =http://www.wargs.com/political/gravel.html| accessdate =2007-05-02}}</ref> a painting contractor.<ref name="wvn">[http://www.worldvoicenews.com/Article.cfm?ID=6465&CID=0&T=NO%20SHORTCUTS%20TO%20THE%20TOP%20(2)&APTMS=1&L=0 "No Shortcuts to the Top (2)"], [[World Voice News]], April 30, 2007.

==Move to Alaska==
Gravel "decided to become a pioneer in a faraway place,"<ref name="nyt022776"/> and moved to pre-statehood Alaska in 1956, without funds or a job, looking for a place where someone without social or political connections could be a viable candidate for [[public office]];<ref name="salon050707"/><ref name="wapo090907"/> Alaska's voting age of 19, less than most other states' 21, played a role,<ref name="nyt070271">{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20D10FD3A5B1A7493C0A9178CD85F458785F9 | title=Impetuous Senator: Maurice Robert Gravel | author=Warren Weaver, Jr. | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=[[1971-07-02]] | accessdate=2007-12-24}}</ref> as did its newness<ref name="wapo090907"/> and cooler climate.<ref name="salon050707"/>  He found work in several areas, including [[real estate]] sales, [[brakeman]] for the [[Alaska Railroad]], and as a very successful property developer on the [[Kenai Peninsula]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~action/2008/gravel/gravel041706int.html|title=Interview with Former U.S. Sen.

Gravel married Rita Jeannette Martin, who had been Anchorage's "[[Miss Fur Rendezvous]]" of 1958,<ref name="currbio86">''[[Current Biography]] Yearbook 1972'', H.W. Wilson Co., published in collection 1986, p. 184.</ref>  on [[April 29]], [[1959]].<ref name="currbio86"/>  They had two children, Martin Anthony Gravel and Lynne Denise Gravel,<ref name="currbio86"/> born circa 1960 and 1962 respectively.<ref name="nyt070271"/>  Meanwhile, he ran unsuccessfully for the territorial legislature in 1958.<ref name="salon050707"/>  He went on a national speaking tour concerning [[tax reform]] in 1959, sponsored by the [[Jaycees]].<ref name="westbio"/>  He ran unsuccessfully for the [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] City Council in 1960.<ref name="salon050707"/>

==State legislator==
With some newfound wealthy backers,<ref name="nyt070271"/> Gravel ran for the [[Alaska House of Representatives]] representing Anchorage in 1962 and won.<ref name="salon050707"/>

Gravel served in the [[Alaska House of Representatives]] from 1963 to 1966, winning re-election in 1964. During  1965 and 1966, he served as the Speaker of the House, surprising observers by winning that post.<ref name="nyt070271"/>  As Speaker he antagonized fellow lawmakers by imposing his will on the legislature's committees.<ref name="nyt070271"/>

He did not run for re-election in 1966, instead choosing to run for [[Alaska's At-large congressional district|Alaska's seat]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], losing to four-term incumbent Democrat [[Ralph Rivers]]<ref name="salon050707"/> by 1,300 votes<ref name="nyt070271"/> and splitting the Democratic party in the process.<ref name="nyt070271"/>

Following his defeat, Gravel returned to the real-estate business in Anchorage.<ref name="nyt070271"/>

==U.S. Senator==
[[Image:Mikegravel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Senator Mike Gravel]]
===Election to Senate in 1968===
In 1968 he ran against the 81-year-old incumbent Democratic Senator [[Ernest Gruening]], a popular former [[List of Governors of Alaska|governor]] of the [[Alaska Territory]] who was considered one of the fathers of Alaska's statehood,<ref name="salon050707"/> for his party's nomination to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].  Gravel's campaign was primarily based on his youth.<ref name="nyt070271"/>  He hired [[Joseph Napolitan]], the first self-described [[political consultant]], in late 1966,<ref name="nyt070271"/> and they spent over a year and a half planning a short primary election campaign that featured a half-hour, well-produced<ref name="salon050707"/> biographical film of Gravel that was shown frequently on both television and on home projectors in many [[Eskimo]] villages.<ref name="nyt070271"/>  The heavy showings quickly reversed a large Gruening lead in polls into a Gravel lead.<ref name="nyt070271"/>  Gravel also benefitted by being deliberately ambiguous about his Vietnam policy. Gruening had been one of only two Senators to vote against the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] and, according to Gravel, "...all I had to do was stand up and not deal with the subject, and people would assume that I was to the right of Ernest Gruening, when in point of fact I was to the left of him."<ref name="salon050707"/> 

Gravel unexpectedly beat Gruening in a tight result<ref name="hnn080706">Robert KC Johnson, [http://hnn.us/articles/28947.html "Not Many Senators Have Found Themselves in Joe Lieberman's Predicament"], [[History News Network]], August 7, 2006. Accessed July 7, 2007.</ref> in the primary and went on to win the general election, gaining 45% of the vote against 37% for Republican [[Elmer E. Rasmuson]] and 18% for Gruening, who ran a write-in campaign as an Independent.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0043-4078(196909)22%3A3%3C456%3AT1EIA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-U | last=Chinn | first=Ronald E. | title=The 1968 Election in Alaska  | year=1969 | month=September | journal=[[The Western Political Quarterly]] | volume=22 | issue=3 | pages=456-461 | accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref>

===Senate assignments and style===
Gravel served on the [[Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Environment and Public Works Committee]] throughout his Senate career. He also served on the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Finance]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs|Interior]] Committees and he chaired the [[Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|
Energy]], [[United States Senate Energy Subcommittee on Water and Power|Water Resources]], and [[United States Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health|Environmental Pollution]] subcommittees.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ni4d.us/people/gravel2.htm | title=Senator Mike Gravel | publisher=National Initiative for Democracy | accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> 

By his own admission Gravel was too new and "too abrasive" to be effective in the Senate by the usual means of seniority-based committee assignments or negotiating backroom deals with other senators,<ref name="nyt070271"/><ref name="nyt102671"/> and was sometimes seen as arrogant by the more senior members.<ref name="nyt070271"/>  Gravel instead relied upon attention-getting gestures to achieve what he wanted, hoping national exposure would force other senators to listen to him.<ref name="nyt102671"/>  As part of this he voted with Southern Democrats to keep the Senate [[filibuster]] rule in place,<ref name="nyt070271"/> and accordingly supported [[Russell Long]] and [[Robert Byrd]] and opposed  [[Ted Kennedy]] in Senate leadership battles.<ref name="nyt070271"/>

===Nuclear issues and the Cold War===
In the late 1960s and early 1970s the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] was in the process of performing  tests for the [[nuclear weapon|nuclear warhead]] for the [[LIM-49A Spartan|Spartan]] [[anti-ballistic missile]] interceptor. Two tests, the [[Amchitka#Milrow and Cannikin tests|Milrow and Cannikin tests]], were planned, involving the [[nuclear testing|detonation of nuclear bombs]] under [[Amchitka|Amchitka Island]] in Alaska.  The Milrow test would be a 1 megaton calibration exercise for the second, and larger 5 megaton, Cannikin test, which would measure the effectiveness of the warhead.  Gravel opposed the tests in Congress.  Before the October 1969 Milrow test took place, he wrote that there were significant risks of earthquakes and other adverse consequences, and called for an independent national commission on nuclear and seismic safety to be created;<ref>{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0F11F9355E1B7493C3AA178CD85F4D8685F9 | title=Risks in Alaska Tests | work=Letters to the Editor | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=[[1969-07-31]] | accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref> he then made a personal appeal to President Nixon to stop the test.<ref name="nyt082371">{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB081FFD3D591A7493C1AB1783D85F458785F9 | title=Underground A-Test Is Still Set For Aleutians but Is Not Final | author=Richard D.

Six months before [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]]'s secret mission to the [[People's Republic of China]] in July 1971, Gravel introduced legislation to [[diplomatic recognition|recognize]] and normalize relations with Communist China, including a proposal for unity talks between Communist China and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] regarding [[China and the United Nations|the China seat at the United Nations question]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/144452802.html?dids=144452802:144452802&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&date=Jan+29%2C+1971&author=&pub=The+Washington+Post%2C+Times+Herald++(1959-1973)&edition=&startpage=A12&desc=Sen.+Gravel+Urges+U.S.+to+Back+Taiwan-Red+China+Unity+Talks | title=Sen.

===Run for Vice President in 1972===

===Re-election to Senate in 1974===
Several years earlier, Alaskan politicians had speculated that Gravel would have a hard time getting both renominated and elected when his first term expired,<ref name="nyt102671"/> given that he was originally elected without a base party organization and tended to focus on national rather than local issues.<ref name="nyt102671"/>

In opposition to the Alaskan fishing industry, Gravel advocated American participation in the formation of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]]. For two years he opposed legislation that established a {{convert|200|mi|km|sing=on}} [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] for marine resources.

In the early 1970s Gravel supported a demonstration project that established links between Alaskan villages and the [[National Institute of Health]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], for medical diagnostic communications.

A key, emotional issue in the state at the time was "locking up Alaska", making reference to allocation of its vast, mostly uninhabited land.<ref name="nyt082680"/>

In 1978, Gravel authored and secured the passage into law of the [[General Stock Ownership Corporation]], that became Subchapter U of the Tax Code under the [[Internal Revenue Code of 1954]].<ref name="kelso-dates">{{cite web | url=http://www.kelsoinstitute.org/important-dates.html | title=Important Dates in the History of Binary Economics | publisher=[[Kelso Institute]] | date=2000 | accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref><ref name=gauche>{{cite journal | title=Binary Economic Modes for the Privatization of Public Assets  | first=Jerry N. | last=Gauche |date=2000 | journal=[[Journal of Socio-Economics]] | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages=445<U+2013>459 | url=http://kelsoinstitute.org/pdf/binaryeconomicmodes.pdf  | accessdate = 2007-12-31}}</ref>  While this was originally done as a prerequisite to a failed 1980 Alaskan ballot initiative that would have paid dividends to Alaskan citizens for pipeline-related revenue,<ref name="gauche"/> it also turned out to be a significant event in the history of the development of [[binary economics]].<ref name="kelso-dates"/>

===Loss of Senate seat in 1980===
{{main|United States Senate election in Alaska, 1980}}

In 1980 Gravel was challenged for the Democratic Party's nomination by State Representative [[Clark Gruening]], the grandson of the man Gravel had defeated in a primary twelve years earlier.  Gruening won the bitterly-fought<ref name="nyt082880"/> primary, with about 55&nbsp;percent of the vote to Gravel's 44&nbsp;percent.<ref name="nyt082880">{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB0817FA355F12728DDDA10A94D0405B8084F1D3 | title=Gravel Loses a Bitter Fight In Senate Primary in Alaska | author=Wallace Turner | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=[[1980-08-28]] | accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref>  As an incumbent candidate in 1968, Gravel had never established a firm party base;<ref name="hnn080706"/> a group of Democrats, including future governor [[Steve Cowper]],<ref name="nyt070682">Wallace Turner, [http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=FB0613F9385F0C758CDDAE0894DA484D81 "Side Issues Figure in Tricky Alaska Primary"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 6, 1982.

To date, Gravel is the last Democrat to represent Alaska in Congress.

==Career after leaving the Senate ==
===A difficult transition===
Gravel took the 1980 defeat hard, recalling years later: "I had lost my career. I lost my marriage. I was in the doldrums for ten years after my defeat,"<ref>Politics1, [http://www.politics1.com/blog-0406a.htm#0417 "P2008:  An Interview With Presidential Candidate Mike Gravel"] by Ron Gunzburger, April 17, 2006.</ref> and "Nobody wanted to hire me for anything important. I felt like I was worthless. I didn't know what I could do."<ref name="wapo090907"/>  Sometime in the early 1980s, he and his first wife Rita were divorced; she would later be the recipient of all of his Senate pension income.<ref name="salon050707"/>  

During the 1980s, Gravel was a [[real estate developer]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] and [[Kenai, Alaska]],<ref>''[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]]'', [http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=G000388 Mike Gravel profile]</ref> a [[consultant]], and a [[stockbroker]].<ref name="salon050707"/>  One of his real estate ventures, a [[condominium]] business, was forced to declare [[bankruptcy]] and a [[lawsuit]] ensued.<ref name="salon050707"/>  Gravel married his second wife, Whitney Stewart Gravel, a former administrative assistant for Senator [[Jacob Javits]],<ref name="wapo090907"/> circa 1984.<ref name="advo">Kerry Eleveld, [http://www.advocate.com/exclusive_detail_ektid47086.asp "Mike Gravel's big splash?"], ''[[The Advocate]]'', July 3, 2007.

===Return to politics===
[[Image:gravelcouple.JPG|thumb|right|Mike Gravel and Whitney Gravel with their dog Ginger]]
Beginning in 1989 he reentered the world of politics.<ref name="salon050707"/>  He became founder and head of [[The Democracy Foundation]], which promotes [[direct democracy]].<ref>[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/0413-11.htm "First Democrat to Announce Candidacy for President on Monday"], Joe Lauria, CommonDreams New Centre, Published [[April 13]], [[2006]]</ref>

Gravel led an effort to get a [[United States Constitution]]al [[Constitutional amendment|amendment]] to allow voter-initiated federal legislation similar to state ballot [[initiative]]s.  He argued that Americans are able to legislate responsibly, and that the Act and Amendment in the [[National Initiative]] would allow American citizens to become "law makers".

Mike and Whitney Gravel live in [[Arlington County, Virginia]].  They have the two grown children from his first marriage, Martin Gravel and Lynne Gravel Mosier, and four grandchildren;<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gravel2008.us/bio | title=Mike Gravel Biography | publisher=Mike Gravel for President 2008 | accessdate=2007-12-29}}</ref> her income has sustained the couple since 1998.<ref name="wapo090907"/>  In the 2000s, Gravel suffered from serious health issues, requiring three surgeries in 2003 for [[back pain]] and [[neuropathy]];<ref name="salon050707"/> due to unreimbursed medical expenses and credit debts taken out for his political causes, he declared [[personal bankruptcy]] in 2004.<ref name="salon050707"/><ref name="wapo090907"/>  After that, he began taking a salary from the non-profit organizations he was working for.  Much of that income was lent to his presidential campaign; in 2007, he declared that he has "zero [[net worth]]."<ref name="salon050707"/>

=== ''Barnes Review'' controversy===
In June 2003 Gravel gave a speech on [[direct democracy]] at a conference hosted by the ''[[American Free Press]]''.  The event was cosponsored by the ''[[Barnes Review]]'',<ref name="salon050707"/> a journal that endorses [[Holocaust denial]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wymaninstitute.org/articles/2003-denialreport.php | title=Holocaust Denial: A Global Survey - 2003 | author=Alex Grobman, Rafael Medoff | publisher=[[David S.

They're [referring to the ''Barnes Review'' and publisher [[Willis Carto]]] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened".<ref name="politics1"/> The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event: 
<blockquote>
"He [Carto] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to ''American Free Press''. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, and a lot of the ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that ''Barnes Review'' Conference. I had never heard of the ''Barnes Review'', didn't know anything about it or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. I could tell from the people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left. I never saw the agenda for the day or listened to any of the other presentations."<ref name="politics1">{{cite news | url=http://www.politics1.com/blog-0406a.htm | title=An Interview with Presidential Candidate Mike Gravel | author=Ron Gunzburger | publisher=Politics1.com | date=[[2006-04-17]] | accessdate=2007-12-29}}</ref>
</blockquote>
Gravel subsequently did get invited to speak before the group again, but declined.<ref name="pjv"/>

==Political positions==
[[Image:Graveld.JPG|thumb|right|Mike Gravel with [[campaign finance reform]] activist and friend Ethel ''[[Granny D]]'' Haddock]]
{{main|Political positions of Mike Gravel}}
Gravel has stated that he is an advocate for "a national, universal single-payer not-for-profit health care system" in the United States which would utilize vouchers and enable citizens to choose their own doctor.<ref name="issues">{{cite web | url=http://www.gravel2008.us/issues | title=How Mike Stands on the Issues | publisher=Mike Gravel for President 2008 | accessdate=2007-12-29}}</ref> He has proposed to index veteran health care entitlements to take full account of increases in the costs of care and medicine.<ref name="issues"/>  He supports a drug policy that legalizes and regulates all drugs, treating drug abuse as a medical issue, rather than a [[War on Drugs|criminal matter]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.iowaindependent.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=131 | title=Fmr.

He is avowedly [[pro-choice]] on the issue of abortion and women's reproductive rights. He supports constitutional amendments towards [[direct democracy]].

Some of his political leanings and convictions may also be gleaned from his 1972-published manifesto, ''Citizen Power''.

==Run for President in 2008==

[[Image:Mgravelgrandpa.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mike Gravel at the launch of his Presidential campaign in April 2006]]
At the start of 2006, Gravel decided the best way he could promote [[direct democracy]] and the [[National Initiative]] was to run for president.<ref name="salon050707"/>

Gravel Runs for President"], [[Associated Press]], April 17, 2006. Accessed March 10, 2007.</ref>
Other principal issues for Gravel were a progressive retail sales tax, which he saw as removing tax loopholes for the rich, relieving tax burdens on the middle class and the poor, and allowing abolition of the [[Internal Revenue Service]]; withdrawal from the [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003-2006|war in Iraq]] within 120 days; a [[single-payer health care|single payer national health care system]]; and [[term limits]].  

Gravel campaigned almost full time in [[New Hampshire]], [[New Hampshire primary|the first primary state]], following his announcement.  Prior to February 2007, [[Opinion polling for the Democratic Party (United States) 2008 presidential candidates|opinion polls of contenders for the Democratic nomination]] all showed Gravel with a 1% or less support level.  He addressed the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s Winter Convention in early February 2007 and was one of the participants in the Democratic Presidential Candidates forum in [[Carson City, Nevada]] later the same month.  At the end of March 2007, Gravel's campaign had less than $500 in cash on hand against debts of nearly $90,000.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/dcdev/forms/C00423202/285065/ | title=FEC Form 3P for Mike Gravel | publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]] | date=[[2007-04-15]] | accessdate=2007-12-29}}</ref> 

On [[April 26]], [[2007]], Gravel took part in the first Democratic presidential debate at [[South Carolina State University]] in [[Orangeburg, South Carolina]]. During the debate he suggested a Democratic bill requiring the president to withdraw from [[Iraq]] on pain of criminal penalties. He also advocated positions such as opposing preemptive [[nuclear war]].  He stated that the [[Iraq War]] had the effect of creating more terrorists and that the "war was lost the day that George Bush invaded Iraq on a fraudulent basis."
