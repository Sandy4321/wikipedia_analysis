"'''Fly on the Wall'''" is a [[pop music|pop]] song performed by American recording artist [[Miley Cyrus]]. It was released as the third international single from Cyrus's sophomore album, ''[[Breakout (album)|Breakout]]'' on February 16, 2009 with a remix of "[[7 Things]]" as a [[B-side]]. Replaced from "Full Circle" due to unknown reasons, it became the second single in the United States, Canada and other nations in which "[[See You Again]]" was not released as the [[See You Again#Rock Mafia remix|Rock Mafia remix]]. The song is one in association with [[pop rock]], [[dance-pop]] and [[synthpop]] elements. Lyrically, the song has had a variation of interpretations, such as one in which the songs are about an overprotective boyfriend. In actuality, Cyrus wrote the song in dedication to the [[paparazzi]] and their personal invasions.

The song received critical praise, with most critics mentioning it defied [[teen pop]] expectations and was ''Breakout'''s best track. Despite only reaching eighty-four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], "Fly on the Wall" also achieved average commercial outcomes for Cyrus in different regions. The song reached its highest international peak in the [[UK Singles Chart]], at number sixteen.

A corresponding music video to "Fly on the Wall," directed by [[Philip Andelman]], premiered on ''[[FNMTV]]''. The "[[Thriller (Michael Jackson song)|Thriller]]" inspired video follows Cyrus on encounters with and attempts to escape the paparazzi. Cyrus promoted the song by performing it at several venues, including on her second headlining tour, the [[Wonder World Tour]]. At one point during the performance she flies on top of the crowd. After, she and her background dancers perform another homage to the late [[Michael Jackson]] with a short segment of the "Thriller" dance.

I just want a couple of shots" and the music of "Fly on the Wall" begins to play. Cyrus starts running and finds herself hiding behind a column in a [[parking lot]]. The video transitions to another scene in which Cyrus is in a black background, wearing a long silver shirt and jeans. Cyrus hides behind a black [[convertible car]] and as soon as she comes from behind it, numerous [[paparazzi]] start chasing her with their cameras. Throughout most of the video Cyrus is hiding and in the other scene dancing in front of the convertible. Eventually, the paparazzi nestle her into a corner with no escape and start dancing meanwhile Cyrus is looking perplexed. Her love interest then arrives in the convertible to rescue her and while Cyrus confesses what occurred, a camera was recording her. In the conclusion, Cyrus's love interest's recording was shown on a website that headlined "Miley Cyrus Bugs at Paparazzi!!!"

It's kind of like where the paparazzi become these [[zombies]] and they're all like attacking me. And my boyfriend is trying to save me, but I don't know if he's a paparazzi too. So, it's like me trying to hide and get away. It's really fun, but I'm escaping from my boyfriend and escaping from the paparazzi and trying to find my way through the whole video."<ref name="accesshollywood" />}}
