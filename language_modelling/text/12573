'''Tropical Storm Dottie''' was the ninth [[tropical cyclone]] and fourth named storm of the [[1976 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The precursor to Dottie formed in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on August 17 and organized into a tropical depression on August 18. The storm drifted towards the east, and, after peaking as a moderate tropical storm, it accelerated northeastward and made landfall on [[Florida]]. Upon re-emerging in the Atlantic, Dottie turned northward and moved ashore near [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Damage from the storm was primarily insignificant and limited to gusty winds, heavy rainfall, and high tides; however, a fishing boat capsized in the [[Bahamas]], resulting in the deaths of four people. 

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Dottie 1976 track.png}}
Dottie originated in an area of [[low pressure area|low pressure]] that formed on August 17, about {{convert|150|mi|km|abbr=on|lk=on}} northwest of [[Key West, Florida]]. The center of the disturbance soon began to consolidate while [[barometric pressure]] fell 8 [[mbar]] in 24 hours;<ref name="TCR1">{{cite web|author=|title=Tropical Storm Dottie Preliminary Report Page 1|date=|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-07-05|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1976-prelim/dottie/prelim01.gif}}</ref> it was declared a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on August 18.<ref name="TCR2">{{cite web|author=|title=Tropical Storm Dottie Preliminary Report Page 2|date=|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-07-05|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1976-prelim/dottie/prelim02.gif}}</ref> The depression drifted east and northeastward over the next day, though it began to accelerate on August 19. The cyclone further intensified to tropical storm status by 1200 UTC. Operationally, however, it was not named until later that day.<ref name="TCR1"/>

Having made landfall in southwestern [[Florida]], Dottie quickly proceeded northeastward before re-emerging into the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. [[High pressure system|High pressure]] building to the north of the storm indicated it would turn more towards the west, but it moved nearly due northward.<ref name="TCR1"/> The cyclone attained its peak intensity with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) at 0600 UTC on August 20<ref name="TCR3">{{cite web|author=|title=Tropical Storm Dottie Preliminary Report Page 3|date=|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-07-05|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1976-prelim/dottie/prelim03.gif}}</ref> and subsequently began to weaken; by the time Dottie made landfall in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] later that evening, it was barely of tropical storm intensity.<ref name="TCR1"/> It deteriorated into a tropical depression on August 21 and dissipated shortly thereafter.<ref name="TCR3"/> The remnant low pressure system turned southward and once again entered the Atlantic before turning westward and crossing the Florida peninsula.<ref name="TCR2"/>

==Preparations and impact==

In response to the storm, [[gale warning]]s were issued on August 19 from [[Jacksonville, Florida]] to [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]. A [[hurricane watch]] was also posted between [[Savannah, Georgia]] and [[Cape Hatteras, North Carolina]]. The hurricane watch was later extended to Jacksonville when conditions appeared more favorable for the storm's intensification, but was soon discontinued.<ref name="TCR1"/> Flooding rains were anticipated in the [[Carolinas]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Thomas Cothran|title=Dottie hits South Carolina|date=August 21, 1976|publisher=''St. Petersburg Times''|accessdate=2009-07-05|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tR4MAAAAIBAJ&sjid=d10DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6810,3095116&dq=tropical+storm+dottie+evacuations}}</ref> though, in contrast, Dottie was compared to a mere thunderstorm by some local officials.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|title=Tropical Storm Dottie Limps Ashore at S.C.|date=August 21, 1976|publisher=''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette''|accessdate=2009-07-05|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nuUNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jW0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3823,1901175&dq=tropical+storm+dottie}}</ref>

Prior to being upgraded to a tropical storm, the depression spawned heavy precipitation and high winds throughout southern Florida and portions of the [[Bahamas]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|title=Heavy Rains Rake Florida, Bahamas|date=August 20, 1976|publisher=''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette''|accessdate=2009-07-06|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=neUNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jW0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3691,1802377&dq=tropical+storm+dottie+1976}}</ref> In the [[Miami]] area, 24-hour rainfall totals from the storm exceeded {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on|lk=on}}, with reports of up to {{convert|8|in|mm|abbr=on}}.

Near the latter location, a fishing boat capsized during the storm; four of its occupants drowned. Along the [[Southeastern U.S.]] coast, tides generally ran {{convert|1|to|2|ft|m|abbr=on}} above normal, peaking at {{convert|3.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} in [[North Carolina]]. Moderate to heavy rainfall was reported in the Carolinas.
