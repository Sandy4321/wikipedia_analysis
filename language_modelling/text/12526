'''Destiny's Child''', sometimes abbreviated as '''DC''', was an [[United States|American]] [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[pop music|pop]] [[girl group]]. Originally a [[quartet]], it eventually became a [[trio (music)|trio]] consisting of [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]], [[Kelly Rowland]], and [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]]. The group released four major [[studio albums]], and achieved numerous [[single (music)|singles]] which hit number one across the world. According to the [[World Music Awards]], Destiny's Child is the best selling female group of all time.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Keller |first=Julie |title=Destiny<U+2019>s World Domination |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/23584356 |work=Yahoo News |date=([[2005]]-[[09-01]]) |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine ranked the group as one of the greatest musical trios of all time.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Billboard Greatest Trios of All Time |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/greatesttrios/2006/destinys_child.jsp |work=Billboard |accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref> 

Formed in 1990 in [[Houston, Texas]], Destiny's Child members began their musical endeavors while in their pre-teens. For years of struggling on the road, they signed in to [[Columbia Records]]. The release of their breakthrough album, ''[[The Writing's On The Wall]]'', launched them to crossover mainstream that established them as a viable artist. While in their commercial peak, the group was plagued because of a public turmoil involving lawsuits; it eventually preempted two members. The strife, however, was believed to only usher the remaining members to wider scale of achievements; they recorded their third album, ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'', which the public inferred as a channel to the experience. Destiny's Child announced a hiatus which involved solo projects; the break facilitated them to earn individual success. They re-united to record their final album, and disbanded in 2005 to pursue their individual careers in music, theatre, television, and film.

==History==

Because of the group's defeat, Knowles' father, [[Mathew Knowles]], voluntarily dedicated his time to manage them; he resigned in 1995 from his job, who was then a medical-equipment salesman.<ref name="E!"/> The move significantly reduced Knowles' family's income by half, and her parents briefly separated due to the pressure.<ref name="E!"/><ref>{{Cite web |title=Beyonce Knowles' Biography |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,204978,00.html?sPage=fnc/entertainment/beyonce |work=FOX News |date=[[2007]]-[[01-18]] |accessdate=2008-04-13}}</ref> Mathew Knowles cut down the original lineup to four with the inclusion of [[LeToya Luckett]]'s in 1993;<ref name="Kaufman"/> he established a "boot camp" to train them.<ref name="E!"/> Rehearsing in the salon of Knowles' mother, Tina, and their backyards, they continued performing as openings for established [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] groups of that time such as [[SWV]], [[Dru Hill]] and [[IMx|Immature]].<ref name="Kaufman"/> Tina Knowles also helped design attires for their performances.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tyrangiel |first=Josh |title=Destiny's Adult |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1005114,00.html |work=TIME |date=[[2003]]-[[06-30]] |accessdate=2008-04-13}}</ref> They signed to [[Elektra Records]] in the same year, but were dropped before they could release an album.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Driven |url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/driven/65240/episode_about.jhtml |work=VH1 |publisher=MTV Networks |accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> In 1997, Knowles' father negotiated with record label [[Columbia Records]] and signed the group.<ref name="Kaufman"/><ref name="People"/>

===1997 &ndash; 1999: Career breakthrough===
Taken from a passage in the [[Book of Isaiah]], Girl's Tyme changed their name to the present Destiny's Child.<ref name="Kaufman"/> The same year they were signed to Columbia, the group recorded their first song, "Killing Time", which appeared on the soundtrack for the 1997 film ''[[Men in Black (film)|Men in Black]]''.<ref name="Kaufman"/>

Destiny's Child released their [[Destiny's Child (album)|self-titled debut album]] in the [[United States]] on [[February 17]], [[1998]], who found working with producers [[Jermaine Dupri]], [[Wyclef Jean]] and Corey Rooney.<ref name="Kaufman"/> ''Destiny's Child'' sold three million copies worldwide, and was certified platinum. The album released its lead single, "[[No, No, No (Destiny's Child song)|No, No, No]]"; its [[remix]] version, featuring [[The Fugees]] member Wyclef Jean, reached number one on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks]] and number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

Knowles considered their debut successful but not as huge because she claimed it a [[neo soul]] record and was way too mature for them.<ref name="Anthony">{{Cite web |last=Anthony |first=James |title='Of course you can lose yourself' |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1852025,00.html |work=The Guardian |date=[[2006]]-[[08-18]] |accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref>

After the success of their debut album, Destiny's Child re-entered the studio quickly, bringing in a new lineup of producers, including [[Kevin "She'kspere" Briggs]]<ref name="Kaufman"/> and [[Rodney Jerkins]]. Coming up with ''[[The Writing's on the Wall]]'', they released it in [[July 27]], [[1999]] and became their breakthrough album.<ref name="Anthony"/> The album debuted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number six, and topped both R&B and pop US charts in early 2000, launching them to crossover markets and establishing them a viable pop group.<ref name="Kaufman"/> "[[Bills, Bills, Bills]]" was released in the summer of 1999 as the album's lead single, which reached the top spot of the ''Billboard'' Hot&nbsp;100, becoming their first US number-one single.<ref name="Kaufman"/> The second single, "[[Bug a Boo]]", hit the Top 40 pop charts.

===1999 &ndash; 2000: Lineup changes===
[[Image:Destiny2000.jpg|thumb|right|The appearance of [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] and [[Farrah Franklin]] in the music video of "[[Say My Name]]" led to the eventual departure of [[LeToya Luckett]] and [[LaTavia Roberson]].]]

In late 1990s, Luckett and Roberson attempted to split with their manager, claiming that he kept a disproportionate share of the group's profits and unfairly favored Knowles and Rowland.<ref name="Kaufman"/> While they never intended to leave the group, when the video for "[[Say My Name]]" surfaced in February 2000, Roberson and Luckett were surprised to find two new members&mdash;[[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] and [[Farrah Franklin]]&mdash;joining Knowles and Rowland.<ref name="Kaufman"/> Roberson and Luckett took legal action in March, suing both Knowles and their band mates for breach of partnership and fiduciary duties.<ref name="Kaufman"/> The opposite sides were disparaging their selves over the media.

After five months of becoming part of Destiny's Child, Franklin left the group for various personal reasons, including her feeling of getting negative vibes because of the recent strife;<ref name="Kaufman"/> her departure, however, was less controversial. Towards the end of 2000, Roberson and Luckett dropped the portion of their lawsuit aimed at Rowland and Knowles in exchange for a settlement, though they continued to pursue action against Knowles' father; as part of the agreement, both sides were prohibited from attacking each other publicly.<ref name="Kaufman"/>

[[Image:Beyonce Independent.jpg|thumb|left|Knowles performing Destiny's Child's hit "[[Independent Women Part I]]", the best-charting single of the group]]

Although the group was plagued by the turmoil, it was never a hinder for them to continue. "It ushered in the group's most successful stretch",<ref name="Kaufman"/> becoming a pop-cultural phenomenon.<ref name="People"/> "Say My Name" became their second number-one and biggest single to date.<ref name="Anthony"/> The albums fourth single, "[[Jumpin' Jumpin']]", became a top-ten hit. ''The Writings on the Wall'' furthered the group's careers as it was one of the top ten-selling albums of 2000; it was eventually certified eight-time platinum in the United States.<ref name="Kaufman"/> Destiny's Child began performing as opening act for concert of American pop singers [[Britney Spears]] and [[Christina Aguilera]].<ref name="Kaufman"/>

Now in their final lineup, Destiny's Child recorded a theme song for the film version of ''[[Charlie's Angels (film)|Charlie's Angels]]''. Released as a single in October 2000, "[[Independent Women Part 1]]" spent eleven consecutive weeks on the ''Billboard'' Hot&nbsp;100 at number one,<ref name="People"/> the longest-running single of Destiny's Child and of that year in the US.

===2000 &ndash; 2002: More releases===
In late 2000, Destiny's Child announced plans of releasing individual side projects, including solo albums.<ref name="VanHornCDs">{{Cite news |last=VanHorn |first=Teri |title=Destiny's Child Solo CDs Won't Compete With Group, Each Other |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1375022/20001208/destinys_child.jhtml |work=MTV News |date=([[2008]]-[[12-08]]) |accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref> This time until early 2001, the group was recording their third album, ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]''. The record shifted the structure in the production process; Knowles assumed more control in co-producing and co-writing almost the entire album.<ref name="Kaufman"/><ref name="VanHornCDs"/> In addition, Knowles completely lead song like "Brown Eyes" and "[[Dangerously in Love (song)|Dangerously in Love]]". However, the lead vocals on the majority of songs on the album are divided evenly, where Knowles and Rowland sing a verse each and Williams does the bridge, although there are some variations.

''Survivor''&mdash;which title was reportedly inspired by a [[disc jockey|DJ]]'s joke about Destiny's Child members 'voting one another off the island', much like the popular [[CBS]] [[reality series]] ''[[Survivor (US TV series)|Survivor]]''<ref name="Kaufman"/>&mdash;hit record stores in the [[spring (season)|spring]] of 2001, and entered the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number one; the debut racked up over 663,000 copies in its first week sales.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cohen |first=Jonathan |title=Destiny's Child Shoot Straight To No. 1 |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=862896 |work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |date=([[2001]]-[[05-09]]) |accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> The first three singles, "[[Independent Women Part I]]", "[[Survivor (song)|Survivor]]" and "[[Bootylicious]]" were huge hits;<ref name="Kaufman"/> the first two were consecutive number-one singles in the UK.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sexton |first=Paul |title=Destiny's Child 'Survive' On U.K. Singles Chart |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=848568 |work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |date=([[2001]]-[[04-23]]) |accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> The album was certified four-time platinum in the US;<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gold and Platinum |url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=Survivor&artist=&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |work=Recording Industry Association of America |accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> it was certified double platinum in Australia and ''The Writing's On The Wall'' has reached triple platinum in the same year.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ARIA Charts - Accreditations - 2001 Albums |url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-albums-2001.htm |work=Australian Recording Industry Assocation |accessdate=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref>  

Toward the end of the year, the group released a [[holiday]] album, ''[[8 Days of Christmas]]''.

The lead single and Grammy-winning song "Survivor" was believed to be a response to the strife although Knowles claimed it as not directing to anybody. Taking it as a breach in agreement which bars every party to stop public disparaging, LeToya and Latavia once again filed another lawsuit against Destiny's Child and [[Sony Music]], shortly following the release of the ''This Is the Remix''; cases were settled in June 2002.<ref name="Kaufman"/>

===2002 &ndash; 2004: Group hiatus===
While on a year-long hiatus, Destiny's Child members successively emerged in the film and music scene. In 2002, Williams released her solo album, ''[[Heart to Yours]]'', a contemporary [[gospel]] collection.<ref name="Kaufman"/> The album reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Top Gospel Albums chart.

To capitalize the success of "Dilemma", Rowland's solo debut album ''[[Simply Deep]]'' was pulled from its early 2003 release to September 2002.<ref name="Corey6">{{Cite news |last=Moss |first=Corey |title=Nelly Hit Forces Change In Plans For Destiny's Child LPs |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1456206/20020722/destinys_child.jhtml |work=MTV News |date=([[2002]]-[[07-22]]) |accessdate=2008-05-08}}</ref>  Rowland took off internationally when ''[[Simply Deep]]'' hit number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]];<ref>{{Cite news |title=Tatu top singles chart again |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2742967.stm |work=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=([[2003]]-[[02-09]]) |accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> in the same year, Rowland made her [[feature film]] debut in the horror film ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]''.

The album released four singles: the lead "[[Lose My Breath]]", "[[Soldier (Destiny's Child song)|Soldier]]", "[[Cater 2 U]]" and "[[Girl (Destiny's Child song)|Girl]]"; the first two reached number three in the US. 

In support of the album, Destiny's Child embarked on their worldwide [[concert tour]], [[Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It Tour]]. On [[June 11]], [[2005]], while at the Palau Sant Jordi in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], the group announced before 16,000 audience their official breakup.<ref name="GilSplit"/> Destiny's Child claimed, however, that naming it ''Destiny Fulfilled'' was not a coincident of sort.<ref name="VineyardSplit">{{Cite news |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |title=Destiny's Child Talk Split: 'It's Not The End' |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1504619/20050623/destinys_child.jhtml |work=MTV News |date=([[2005]]-[[06-23]]) |accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref> Right in the making of the album, they planned to part ways after their fourteen-year career as a group to facilitate their continued pursuit in individual aspirations. Knowles stated that their destinies were already fulfilled.<ref name="VineyardSplit"/> The group exclusively sent a letter to [[MTV News]] about the decision:

<blockquote>
We have been working together as Destiny's Child since we were 9, and touring together since we were 14. After a lot of discussion and some deep soul searching, we realized that our current tour has given us the opportunity to leave Destiny's Child on a high note, united in our friendship and filled with an overwhelming gratitude for our music, our fans, and each other. After all these wonderful years working together, we realized that now is the time to pursue our personal goals and solo efforts in earnest. ... No matter what happens, we will always love each other as friends and sisters and will always support each other as artists. We want to thank all of our fans for their incredible love and support and hope to see you all again as we continue fulfilling our destinies. <br>&mdash;Destiny's Child, [[MTV News]]<ref name="GilSplit"/>

===2005 &ndash; 2006: Final releases===
The group released on [[October 25]], [[2005]] their greatest hits album, ''[[#1's (Destiny's Child album)|#1's]]''. The compilation includes number-one hits of the group, including "Independent Woman Part 1", "Say My Name" and "Bootylicious". Three new tracks were also added for the compilation; including "[[Stand Up For Love]]", which was recorded for the theme song of World Children's Day, and "[[Check on It]]", a song Knowles recorded for ''[[The Pink Panther (2006 film)|The Pink Panther]]'''s soundtrack.<ref name="Moss#1's">{{Cite news |last=Moss |first=Corey |title=Destiny's Child Look Back With #1's Before Going Their Separate Ways |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1510101/09212005/destinys_child.jhtml |work=MTV News |date=([[2005]]-[[09-21]]) |accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref> ''#1's'' was also released as a [[DualDisc]], featuring the same track listing, seven videos of selected songs and a trailer of ''[[Destiny's Child: Live in Atlanta]]'' concert DVD.<ref name="Moss#1's"/> The documentary was taken during the [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] visit of the [[Destiny Fulfilled ... And Lovin' It]] tour, and was released on [[March 28]], [[2006]].

The title of compilation fueled minor issues from concerned people as it only contains but not all number-ones. While the liner notes of the compilation does not present any information regarding commercial performances of the songs featured in it, Keith Caulfield of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' claimed that the name could only be "a marketing angle".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Caulfield |first=Keith |title=Ask Billboard |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001393289 |work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc |date=[[2005]]-[[11-01]] |accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref> Despite this, Chris Harris of [[MTV News]] said that it "lives up to its name";<ref name="Harris#1's">{{Cite news |last=Harris |first=Chris |title=Destiny's Child's #1's Hits <U+2014> You Guessed It <U+2014> #1 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1512779/20051102/destinys_child.jhtml |work=MTV News |date=([[2005]]-[[11-02]]) |accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref> ''#1's'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with sales of 113,000, becoming their second highest album debut.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Whitmire |first=Margo |title=Destiny's '#1's' Bows At The Top |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001432508 |work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |date=([[2005]]-[[11-02]]) |accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref> "Stand Up For Love" was released as Destiny's Child's last single.

Destiny's Child's last televised performance was at the 2006 [[NBA All-Star Game]] on [[February 19]] in [[Houston, Texas]]; however, Knowles commented, "It's the last album, but it's not the last show."<ref>{{Cite news |author=MTV News staff |title=For The Record: Quick News On Kanye West, Destiny's Child, Metallica, Kelly Clarkson, Paris Hilton & More |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1523969/20060208/west_kanye.jhtml? |work=MTV News |date=([[2006]]-[[02-08]]) |date=2008-05-13}}</ref> On [[March 28]], [[2006]], Destiny's Child was cemented on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], the 2,035th recipient of the coveted recognition.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Associated Press |title=Destiny's Child Gets Star on Walk of Fame |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,189491,00.html?sPage=fnc/entertainment/beyonce |work=FOX News |date=([[2006]]-[[03-29]] |accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref>

===2007: Mini-reunions===
Knowles' music video of her single "[[Get Me Bodied]]", features Rowland, Williams, and Knowles' sister [[Solange Knowles|Solange]]. The video was released on the ''[[B'Day Anthology Video Album]]'' in early April 2007. Knowles expressed: "It really sets the tone of the video, because you feel like you're there for part of the experience."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |title=Beyonce: Behind The B'Day Videos (Part 2) |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/b/beyonce/videos_07/news_feature_040207/index2.jhtml |work=MTV News |accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref> On [[June 26]], [[2007]], the group made a mini-reunion at the 2007 [[BET Awards]]. Knowles performed "Get Me Bodied" with special guests: Williams, Solange Knowles, and [[Mo'Nique]]. After her performance, Knowles introduced Rowland who performed her single "[[Like This (Kelly Rowland song)|Like This]]" with [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hudson, Beyonce, T.I.

During the [[September 2]], [[2007]] [[Los Angeles]] stop of [[The Beyonc<U+00E9> Experience]] tour, Knowles sang a snippet of "Survivor" with Rowland and Williams; they also sang "Happy Birthday" to Knowles. The performance was featured in Knowles' tour DVD, ''[[The Beyonc<U+00E9> Experience Live!]]'', released on [[November 20]], [[2007]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Crosley |first=Hillary |title=Billboard Bits: Beyonce, Bob Marley, Bragg/Brad |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003646949 |work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |date=([[2007]]-[[09-27]]) |accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref>

===Philanthropy===
In 2005, record producer [[David Foster]], his daughter Amy Foster-Gillies and Knowles wrote "[[Stand Up For Love]]" for the anthem of World [[Children's Day]], an event which takes place annually around the world on [[December 31]] to raise awareness and funds for children's causes worldwide. Over the past three years, more than $50 million has been raised to benefit Ronald McDonald House Charities and other children's organizations. Destiny's Child lent their voices and support as global ambassadors for the 2005 program.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Destiny's Child Releases New Anthem for World Children's Day at McD's |url=http://www.mcdonalds.com/corp/news/corppr/2005/CPR_09272005.html |work=McDonalds |date=([[2005]]-[[09-27]]) |accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref>

Rowland and Knowles, along with the latter's family, founded the Survivor Foundation, a charitable entity set up for the purpose of providing transitional housing for [[Hurricane Katrina]] victims and storm evacuees in the Houston, Texas area. The Survivor Foundation extended the mission of the Knowles-Rowland Center For Youth, a multi-purpose community outreach facility in downtown Houston.<ref name="Moss#1's"/>
