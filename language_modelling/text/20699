==Housing inequality (United States)==
'''Housing inequality''' refers to the differences in the quality of housing that exist within a given society.  It has implications for the [[functionings]] available to an individual or family and tends to focus on the negative aspects of inequality<ref>Sen 2004 p. 61</ref>.  The term may apply regionally across a geographic space, temporally between one generation and the next, or culturally between groups of varying racial or social backgrounds<ref>Pryce 2009 p. 145</ref>.  Housing inequality is directly related to concepts of [[Racism in the United States | racial inequality]], [[Social inequality]], [[Income inequality in the United States | income inequality]], and [[Wealth inequality in the United States | wealth inequality]].  
Housing inequality is the result of a number of factors including natural [[Free market | market forces]], [[Housing discrimination]], and [[Housing Segregation]].  Housing inequality is also often linked to discussions of [[Poverty]].  This is because it can be seen as both a cause and an effect of poverty<ref>Yinger 2001p. 360</ref>.  Housing inequality is especially relevant to discussions of poverty when considering [[Amartya Sen]]<U+2019>s definition of poverty as <U+201C>the deprivation of basic capabilities<U+201D><ref>Sen 1999 p. 87</ref>.
=== Relation to economic inequality ===
Housing inequality is a type of [[Economic inequality]].   This is due to the fact that disparities in housing explain variations in the conversion of income into [[Capability approach | human capabilities]] over differing social climates<ref>Sen 2004 p. 61</ref>.  Put more simply, income does not always translate to desirable outcomes like healthcare, education, and happiness.  The quality of one<U+2019>s housing is one factor that determines if such capabilities are readily available to an individual<ref>Yinger 2001 p. 367</ref>.  Amartya Sen reasons that an individual<U+2019>s available freedoms, or capabilities, are significant indicators of the kind of life one values or has reason to value<ref>Sen 1999 p. 18</ref>.  
===Causes===
[[John Milton Yinger | John Yinger]]<ref>Yinger 2001</ref> explains urban residential inequality as a result of natural housing market forces.  Yinger<ref>Yinger 2001p. 360</ref> reasons that, all else being equal, housing becomes relatively more expensive as it grows closer to work sites.  Because poorer families often cannot afford to pay transportation costs they may be forced to live in inner-city locations closer to employment opportunities.  Consequently in order to the win the spatial competition for housing near work sites, lower-income families must compensate for high priced location by accepting smaller housing, lower quality housing, or both <ref>Yinger 2001 p. 363</ref>.  Ultimately these market forces are subject to other socio-economic factors as no one cause can explain housing inequality.
In the United States, [[Thomas Shapiro]] and Jessica Kenty-Drane<ref>Shapiro 2005</ref> point to the wealth gaps between African Americans and other groups in the United States as likely causes of the housing disparity between African Americans and the rest of America.  The pair contends that obstacles exist that have prevented blacks from accumulating wealth.  Historical factors such as slavery and racial segregation, the two argue, have constrained African Americans from securing and accumulating assets <ref> Shapiro 2005 p. 176</ref>.  As a result, African Americans have had a difficult time acquiring high quality housing.  
Yinger<ref>Yinger 2001 p. 376</ref> also suggests that [[Racism | racial discrimination]] still plays a role in housing searches.  According to Yinger<ref>Yinger 1997 p. 23</ref>, black and Hispanic households must pay higher search costs, accept lower quality housing, and live in lower quality neighborhoods due to discrimination in the search process.  One study<ref>Yinger 1997 p. 32</ref> found that 20% of potential moves made by black households and 17% of potential moves made by Hispanic households were discouraged by existing discrimination within the housing search process.
===Effects===
The most direct effect of residential inequality is an inequality of neighborhood amenities.  Neighborhood amenities include factors such as the conditions of surrounding houses, the availability of [[Social network | social networks]], the amount of [[Air pollution]], the [[Crime statistics | Crime rate]], and the quality of local schools <ref>Yinger 2001 p. 362</ref>.  A neighborhood with a certain quality of amenities typically includes individual residences of corresponding quality. It follows then that those with lower incomes usually end up living in areas with poor amenities in order to win the [[Spatial mismatch | spatial competition]] for housing.  Apart from the intrinsic value of neighborhood amenities like the satisfaction derived from living in a nice area, many studies suggest that growing up in a high poverty neighborhood affects social and economic outcomes later in life <ref>Yinger 2001 p. 368</ref>.  
Another way that the poor compete in the spatial competition for housing is by renting homes rather than buying them.  This furthers the negative effects of housing inequality by restricting access to [[Personal finance | household wealth]] <ref>Krivo and Kaufman 2004</ref>.  The effects of housing inequality are necessarily related to economic inequality as they greatly affect the freedoms available to an individual.
===Proposed remedies===
There have been a number of plans proposed to remedy the negative effects of housing inequality.  Such plans include:
* [[Subsidized housing]]
** Co-operative housing
** Non-profit housing
** Rent supplements
* [[Section 8 (housing) | Private sector housing]]
* [[Predatory lending | Fair lending enforcement]]
* [[Scattered site housing]]
===International housing inequality===
While the focus of housing inequality has changed over time, contemporary international analyses tend to center on [[Urbanization]] and the move to metropolitan areas.  International housing inequality is largely characterized by urban disparities.  A 2007 UN-HABITAT<ref>UN-HABITAT 2007</ref> report estimated that over one billion people worldwide lived in [[Slum | slums]] at the time, with that figure expected to double by 2030.  
In developing countries, housing inequality is increasingly caused by rural-to-urban migration, increasing urban poverty and inequality, insecure tenure, and globalization <ref>UN-HABITAT)</ref>.  All of these factors contribute to the creation and continuation of slums in poorer areas of the world.  One proposed solution to slums is the concept of [[Slum upgrading]].
