He entered the [[2002 NBA Draft]], and after negotiating with the CBA and the Sharks to secure his release, he was selected by the Houston Rockets as the first overall pick of the draft. He has since been selected to start for the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] in the [[NBA All-Star Game]] in all six of his seasons, and has been named to the [[All-NBA Team]] team three times. However, the Rockets have not advanced past the first round of the playoffs since he joined the team, and he has missed significant time due to injury in each of the past three seasons.

Yao is married to [[Ye Li (basketball)|Ye Li]], a former player for the China's women's national team.

==Career in China==
===Early life and CBA career===
Yao was the only child of 6&nbsp;ft 7&nbsp;in (2.01&nbsp;m) Yao Zhiyuan and 6&nbsp;ft 3&nbsp;in<ref name="ref1">{{cite web | title = NBA: Yao Ming Info Page | publisher= NBA.com | url = http://www.nba.com/playerfile/yao_ming/bio.html | accessdate = 2007-05-04 }}</ref> (1.90&nbsp;m) Fang Fengdi, both of whom were former professional basketball players.<ref>{{cite book | last = Bucher | first = Ric | coauthors = Ming, Yao | title = Yao: A Life in Two Worlds | publisher = [[Miramax Books]] | date = 2004 | pages = xviii | isbn = 978-1401352141}}</ref> At {{convert|11|lb|kg}}, Yao weighed more than twice as much as the average Chinese newborn,<ref name="ref3">{{cite book | last = Larmer | first = Brook | title = The Creation of Yao Ming | publisher = [[Time (magazine)]] | date = [[November 7]], [[2005]] | url = http://www.time.com/time/asia/covers/501051114/story.html}}</ref> and he grew to be {{convert|5|ft|5|in|m}} by age ten.<ref name="book">{{cite book | last = Bucher | first = Ric | coauthors = Ming, Yao | title = Yao: A Life in Two Worlds | pages = 25}}</ref> At that age, he was examined by sports doctors, who predicted that he would grow to {{convert|7|ft|3|in|m}}.<ref name="book"/> Yao started playing basketball at age nine, and he went to a junior sports school at the same age.<ref>{{cite book | last = Bucher | first = Ric | coauthors = Ming, Yao | title = Yao: A Life in Two Worlds | pages = 29}}</ref> 

Yao first tried out for the Sharks junior team when he was 13, and he practiced for 10&nbsp;hours a day to make the team.<ref>{{cite book | last = Bucher | first = Ric | coauthors = Ming, Yao | title = Yao: A Life in Two Worlds | pages = 31}}</ref> After playing with the junior team for four years, Yao joined the senior team  of the Sharks at age 17, and averaged 10&nbsp;points and 8&nbsp;[[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] a game in his [[CBA 1997-98|rookie season]]. However, his next season was cut short when he broke his foot for the second time in his career, which Yao said decreased his jumping ability by four to six inches (10 to 15&nbsp;cm).<ref>{{cite book | last = Bucher | first = Ric | coauthors = Ming, Yao | title = Yao: A Life in Two Worlds | pages = 50}}</ref>  The Sharks made the finals of the CBA in Yao<U+2019>s [[CBA 1999-00|third season]] and again the [[CBA 2000-01|next year]], but lost both times to the [[Bayi Rockets]]. When [[Wang Zhizhi]] left for the NBA the [[CBA 2001-02|following year]], the Sharks finally won their first championship. During the playoffs in his final year with Shanghai, Yao averaged 38.9&nbsp;points and 20.2&nbsp;rebounds a game, while shooting 76.6% from the field,<ref>{{cite web | title = NBADraft.net <U+2013> Yao Ming Profile | publisher = nbadraft.net | url = http://www.nbadraft.net/profiles/yaoming.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-06 }}</ref> and made all 21 of his shots during one game in the finals.<ref>{{cite news | last = Beech | first = Hannah | title = China<U+2019>s Incredible Hulk of the hardcourt becomes an NBA sensation | publisher = Time Magazine | date = 2003 | url = http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/heroes/yao_ming.html | accessdate = 2007-05-08 }}</ref>

===Entering the NBA Draft===
Yao was initially pressured to enter the [[1999 NBA draft|NBA Draft in 1999]] by Li Yaomin, the deputy general manager of the Shanghai Sharks.<ref name="ref3"/> Li also influenced Yao to sign a contract for Evergreen Sports Inc. to serve as his agent. The agreement entitled Evergreen to 33% of Yao's earnings,<ref name="ref3"/> but the contract was later determined to be invalid.<ref>{{cite book | last = Bucher | first = Ric | coauthors = Ming, Yao | title = Yao: A Life in Two Worlds | pages = 68}}</ref>

When Yao decided to enter the [[2002 NBA Draft]], a team of advisers was formed that was collectively named <U+201C>Team Yao<U+201D>. The team consisted of Yao<U+2019>s negotiator, Erik Zhang; his NBA agent, Bill Duffy; his Chinese agent, Lu Hao; [[University of Chicago]] economics professor John Huizinga;<ref>{{cite web | title = John Huizinga Chicago GSB Faculty | publisher=  ChicagoGSB.com | url = http://www.chicagogsb.edu/faculty/bio.aspx?person_id=164395 | accessdate = 2008-03-13 }}</ref> and the vice president for marketing at BDA Sports Management, Bill Sanders.<ref>{{cite web | title = Introducing Team Yao | publisher = BusinessWeek | date = [[October 25]], [[2004]] | url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_43/b3905019.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-08 }}</ref> Yao was widely predicted to be picked number one overall.<ref>{{cite web | last = Ainge | first = Danny | title = Danny Ainge's Mock Draft | publisher = NBA | date = 2002 | url = http://www.nba.com/draft2002/ainge_mock_draft.html | accessdate = 2008-03-13 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Katz | first = Andy | title = Deals will likely shake up draft | publisher = [[ESPN.com]] | date = [[June 25]], [[2002]]| url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nbadraft/story?id=1398733 | accessdate = 2008-03-13 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Thomsen | first = Ian | title = Let the picking begin | publisher= [[Sports Illustrated]] | date = [[June 19]], [[2002]] | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/2002/draft/news/2002/06/19/thomsen_mock | accessdate = 2008-03-13 }}</ref> However, some teams were concerned about Yao's NBA eligibility due to uncertainty over whether the CBA would let Yao play in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | last = Katz | first = Andy | title = 2002 NBA Draft: ESPN's Takes | publisher = ESPN.com | date = [[June 25]], [[2002]]. | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nbadraft/story?id=1384375 | accessdate = 2007-06-26}}</ref>

Before Yao<U+2019>s first meeting with [[Shaquille O'Neal]] on [[January 17]], [[2003]], O'Neal said, "Tell Yao Ming, ching-chong-yang-wah-ah-soh", prompting accusations of racism from the [[Asian American]] community.<ref>{{cite news | last = Tang | first = Irwin | title = APA Community Should Tell Shaquille O<U+2019>Neal to <U+2018>Come down to Chinatown. | publisher = Asianweek | url = http://www.asianweek.com/2003_01_03/sports_yaoming.html | accessdate = 2007-05-08}}</ref> O'Neal denied that his comments were racist, and said he was only joking.<ref name="racism">{{cite news | title = Shaq says mock accent was used jokingly | | publisher = ESPN | url = http://espn.go.com/nba/news/2003/0110/1490645.html | accessdate = 2008-03-18}}</ref> Yao also said he believed O'Neal was joking,<ref name="racism"/> but the comments led to increased media coverage in the buildup to the nationally televised game.
