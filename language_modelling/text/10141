'''Keith Ormond Edley Johnson''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (28 December 1894 <U+2013> 19 October 1972) was an Australian [[cricket]] administrator. He was the manager of the [[Australian Services cricket team]] in England, India and Australia immediately after [[World War II]], and of the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian team that toured England in 1948]]. The 1948 Australian cricket team earned the [[sobriquet]] [[The Invincibles (cricket)|The Invincibles]] by being the first side to complete a tour of England without losing a single match.<ref>{{Cite web

Johnson's career in cricket administration was later affected by his involvement in the 1952 libel case brought by [[Sid Barnes]] over his exclusion from the [[Test cricket|Test]] team in the series against [[West Indies cricket team|the West Indies]]. Johnson's muddled evidence led to the collapse of the trial; after the proceedings he took no further part in cricket administration.

Johnson joined the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Board of Control for International Cricket]] in 1935 as a delegate for [[New South Wales]] and served in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] during [[World War II]], performing [[public relations]] work in [[London]]. With the [[VE Day|allied victory in Europe]], [[first-class cricket]] resumed and Johnson was appointed to manage the Australian Services team, which played England in a series of celebratory matches known as the [[Victory Tests]] to usher in the post-war era. The series was highly successful, with unprecedented crowds raising large amounts for war charities. As a result, further matches were scheduled and Johnson's men toured [[British India]] and Australia before being demobilised. Johnson's administration was regarded as a major factor in the success of the tour.

In 1948, Johnson managed the Australian tour of England, which again brought record profits and attendances, in spite of Australia's overwhelming dominance. Johnson's management of the tour<U+2014>which generated large amounts of media attention<U+2014>was again lauded. However, in 1951<U+2013>52, the Australian Board of Control excluded Barnes from the team for "reasons other than cricket". Barnes took the matter to court, and in the ensuing trial, his lawyer embarrassed Johnson, who contradicted himself several times under cross-examination. Following the trial, Johnson resigned from the board and took no further part in cricket administration.

== Early life and pre-war career ==
Johnson was born on 28 December 1894 in the inner-[[Sydney]] suburb of [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]].<ref name=ww2/> He later moved to the [[Sydney North Shore|north shore]] suburb of [[Mosman, New South Wales|Mosman]], working as a mechanic before serving briefly in the 3rd Field Company Army Engineers.<ref name=ww1/> On 8 October 1916, in the middle of [[World War I]], Johnson enlisted in the [[First Australian Imperial Force]] as a gunner in the 5th Field Artillery Brigade.<ref name=ww1/> His unit left Sydney on 10 February 1917 and headed for Europe.

During  [[World War II]], Johnson served in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). He enlisted in the RAAF on 13 April 1942 in Sydney.<ref name=ww2/> Johnson rose to the rank of [[Flight Lieutenant]] and was deployed to London,<ref name=wisdenobit/> where he did [[public relations]] work at the RAAF's overseas headquarters.<ref name=ww2/><ref name=h97>Haigh and Frith, p. 97.</ref> In June 1945, he was appointed as manager of the [[Australian Services cricket team]] on its tour of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] for the [[Victory Tests]], [[India]] and Australia from mid-1945 to early-1946.<ref name="wisdenobit">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/228453.html|title=Obituaries in 1972|publisher=[[Wisden]], [[Cricinfo]]|language=English|accessdate=2009-02-14}}</ref> Officially a military unit, the team's [[commanding officer]] was [[Squadron Leader]] [[Stan Sismey]] of the RAAF, although the on-field captain was [[Warrant Officer]] [[Lindsay Hassett]] of the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]].<ref>Perry, pp. 98&ndash;104.</ref> 

[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] praised Johnson's organisational work in arranging the services' tour: "A stranger to this country, he found the programme in only skeleton form; and that the tour proved such a success from every point of view was due to his hard work and courtesy."<ref>{{Cite book | title = [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] | edition = 1946 | publisher = [[Wisden]] | chapter = Australian Services in 1945 | page = 157 }}</ref> The almanack reprinted Johnson's message of thanks to the English cricket community in full before the team sailed to India.<ref name=wisdenobit/> 

The Victory Tests started in May 1945 between the Australian Services and England in celebration of [[VE Day|the allied victory in Europe]]. In previous seasons, the English cricket administrator and former captain [[Pelham Warner]] had organised matches between the [[Royal Australian Air Force cricket team|RAAF]] and various English military teams as an expression of defiance against [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] air raids, and the Victory Tests were a continuation of this, although the matches were only three days long and did not have [[Test cricket|Test status]].<ref>Perry, pp. 103&ndash;104.</ref><ref>Pollard (1988), pp. 358&ndash;362.</ref>

In the First Victory Test, the Australian Servicemen scraped home by six wickets with only two balls and minutes to spare. The last pre-war series between England and Australia in 1938 had been an attritional and hard-nosed contest, but in the afterglow of the war victory, the cricketers played flamboyantly with abandon in front of packed crowds. The attractive, attacking style of play was widely praised by commentators and the match raised <U+00A3>1,935 for war relief charities.<ref>Perry, pp. 106&ndash;110.</ref><ref>Pollard (1988), pp. 362&ndash;363.</ref> England then levelled the series by winning the Second Victory Test at [[Bramall Lane]], [[Sheffield]] with a hard-fought battle, by  41 runs.<ref>Perry, pp. 111&ndash;114.</ref> Australia won the Third Victory Test by four wickets late on the final day and drew the Fourth Victory Test at Lord's. That would have been the end of the series, but because of the record attendance of 93,000 at Lord's, another match was appended.<ref>Perry, pp. 122&ndash;128.</ref><ref>Pollard (1988), pp. 364&ndash;366.</ref> England drew the series by winning the Fifth Victory Test in front of another capacity crowd. The Victory Tests were regarded as an outstanding success, with a total attendance of 367,000 and bright and attacking play.<ref>Perry, pp. 130&ndash;132.</ref>

Due to the unexpectedly strong success of the Victory Tests, the [[government of Australia]], acting on the impetus of Foreign Minister [[Doc Evatt]], ordered the Australian Services to delay their demobilisation. With the team raising so much money for war charities, the government directed them to travel home via [[British India|India]] and [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] to play further matches, in order to raise more funds for the [[Red Cross]].<ref>Perry, pp. 137&ndash;138.</ref><ref>Pollard (1988), p. 367.</ref>

Johnson found himself in a difficult situation during the Indian leg of the tour. The team<U+2014>mostly made up of RAAF personnel<U+2014>had been ill with food poisoning and dysentery, and travelled across the [[Indian subcontinent]] by long train journeys. The airmen wanted to travel by air, and threatened to abandon the tour or replace Hassett, an AIF member, with either [[Keith Carmody]] or [[Keith Miller]], who were RAAF fighter pilots. However, the standoff was ended when Sismey arranged for a RAAF plane to transport the team.<ref>Perry, pp. 145&ndash;146.</ref><ref>Pollard (1988), p. 369.</ref> On the playing arena, it was not a happy tour for Johnson and his men. They lost the three-match series against India 1&ndash;0 and recorded only one victory, against [[South Zone cricket team|South Zone]], in their nine matches.<ref>Perry, pp. 151&ndash;152.</ref><ref>Pollard (1988), pp. 368&ndash;370.</ref>

Johnson's team arrived in Australia towards the end of 1945, but the armed services and Australian Board of Control ordered them to play another series against the various Australian states.<ref>Perry, p. 157.</ref> Johnson had sought fixtures for his team in Australia, but this was before the Evatt had added the matches in the subcontinent.<ref>Jaggard, p. 70.</ref> He implored the administrators to recognise that the players were already overworked, but was ignored.<Ref>Jaggard, p. 71.</ref> The Services performed poorly; after playing out consecutive draws against [[Western Warriors|Western Australia]] and [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]], they were crushed by an innings by both [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] and [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]], before drawing against [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] and [[Tasmanian Tigers|Tasmania]], the smallest state in the country.<ref>Perry, pp. 157&ndash;164.</ref><ref>Pollard (1988), pp. 371&ndash;374.</ref>

Johnson was involved in another administrative dispute during the Australian leg of the campaign. [[Cec Pepper]]<U+2014>whom teammates Miller and [[Dick Whitington]] regarded as one of the best [[all rounder]]s in the world and a certainty for Australian Test selection<U+2014>appealed for [[leg before wicket]] against Australian captain [[Don Bradman]] in the match against South Australia. The appeal was turned down and Pepper complained to the umpire [[John Scott (cricketer)|Jack Scott]], prompting Bradman&mdash;who was also a member of the Australian Board of Control and the board of the [[South Australian Cricket Association]]&mdash;to ask Scott whether Pepper's behaviour was acceptable. As he was an employee of the SACA, Scott answered to Bradman, and he lodged a complaint about Pepper to the Australian Board of Control. Pepper was subsequently never selected for Australia.<ref name=p372>Pollard (1988), p. 372.</ref> Cricket historian [[Gideon Haigh]] said that "Johnson was clearly upset by the affair, and also by the failure of the [national] selection panel [Bradman among them]&nbsp;... to send Pepper, second only to Miller as a cricketer in the Services XI, to [[Australian cricket team in New Zealand in 1945-46|New Zealand]]".<ref name=pepper>Haigh and Frith, pp. 98&ndash;99.</ref> Johnson tried to intercede on Pepper's behalf, to no avail, although the other board members claimed that no pressure had been placed on the selectors to exclude Pepper.<ref name=pepper/>

The home leg of the tour was a poor end to the long and taxing Australian Services campaign. As the military men played poorly in Australia, the national selectors concluded that their achievements against England must have been against weak opposition,<ref name=p372/> and only Hassett and Miller were selected for the Australian tour of New Zealand.<ref>Perry, pp. 164&ndash;165.</ref> Johnson then helped to arrange England's first post-war tour of Australia, in 1946&ndash;47.<ref name=h97/>

===1948 tour===
{{seealso|Australian cricket team in England in 1948}}
Johnson was a late appointment as manager for the 1948 tour of England, taking over from his New South Wales colleague Bill Jeanes, who was secretary of the Australian Board of Control and had managed the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1938|previous Australian tour of England in 1938]].<ref name=fortynine/> Jeanes had become increasingly unpopular among the players due because of an approach that Haigh called "increasingly officious and liverish".<ref>Haigh and Frith, p. 100.</ref> 

Led by Bradman<U+2014>widely regarded as the greatest batsman in history<U+2014>the Australians went through their 34 matches without defeat, earning the sobriquet ''The Invincibles''. They won 25 of their matches, 17 of these by an innings, and crushed England 4&ndash;0 in the five Tests, winning most games heavily.<ref name=h101/> 

Despite the Australians' domination of the local teams, the English public showed unprecedented levels of interest in the cricket.<ref name=h101/> Record gate takings were registered at most venues, even when rain affected the  matches,<ref name=p226>Perry, p. 226.</ref> and the record attendance for a Test match in England was broken twice, in the [[Second Test, 1948 Ashes series|Second Test]] at Lord's and the [[Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series|Fourth Test]] at [[Headingley]]. The 158,000 spectators that watched the proceedings at Headingley remain a record for a Test on English soil.<ref>{{Cite book | title = [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] | edition = 2007 | publisher = [[Wisden]] |  page = 505 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Allen |first= Peter |title= The Invincibles: The Legend of Bradman's 1948 Australians |year=1999 |publisher= Allen and Kemsley |location=Mosman, NSW, Australia |isbn= 1-875171-06-1 |pages=106&ndash;107}}</ref> As a result, Australia made <U+00A3>82,671 from the tour, resulting in a profit of <U+00A3>54,172.<ref name=h101>Haigh and Frith, p. 101.</ref> The popularity of the team meant that they were inundated with invitations for social appointments with government officials and members of the royal family, and they had to juggle a plethora of off-field engagements, with 103 days of scheduled cricket in the space of 144 days.<ref name=sched>{{cite web|title=Matches, Australia tour of England, Apr-September 1948 |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/invincibles/engine/series/61329.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> As a result, Johnson was flooded with phone calls and letters, which he had to attend to by himself, as he was the only administrator among the touring party.<ref name=b233>Bradman, p. 233.</ref> Bradman later said he was worried that Johnson's tireless work would cause health problems and that "it was the tribute to a bulldog determination to see the job through".<ref name=b233/>

Johnson was again praised by Wisden in its report on the 1948 tour. "Indebtedness for the smooth running of the tour and general harmony of the team was due largely to the manager, Mr Keith Johnson, hard-working and always genial," it said. "Paying tribute to the loyalty of the players, Mr Johnson said there had not been a discordant note in the party throughout the tour."<ref name="fortynine">{{Cite book | title = [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] | edition = 1949 | publisher = [[Wisden]] | chapter = Australians in England, 1948 | page = 211 }}</ref> The journalist [[Andy Flanagan]] labelled Johnson as "conscientious, reserved, dignified, extraordinarily industrious and scrupulously trustworthy".<ref name=b233/> Bradman said that Johnson "created friends and goodwill everywhere both for himself and the team, and no side could have wished for a better Manager".<ref name=b233/> On the journey back to Australia, the players presented Johnson with a silver Georgian salver, with their signatures engraved on the momento.<ref name=b233/>

In the light of subsequent events, Johnson's singling out of a meeting with the royal family as the highlight of the tour was perhaps significant. In a "farewell message" to England quoted in Wisden, he said that the "most lasting memory" would be the team's visit to [[Balmoral Castle]].<ref name=fortynine/> Johnson said "We felt we were going into an Englishman's home and into his family heart".<ref name=fortynine/> "It was difficult to believe that we were being entertained by Royalty. My personal wish would be for everybody in the Empire to spend an hour or so with the King and Queen. It would do them a tremendous amount of good."<ref name="fortynine"/>

===Barnes libel case===
{{seealso|Sid Barnes}}
[[File:Sid Barnes, 16 Petersham.jpg|thumb|left|Barnes at the age of 16 |alt=A teenage boy leans over his bat, in front of the stumps, in readiness to face a ball. He is wearing a white shirt, trousers and a cap]] 
Johnson's claim of tour harmony and player loyalty in 1948 was thrown into a different light by events less than four years later. The opening batsman [[Sid Barnes]]<U+2014>a core member of the 1948 team<U+2014>was seeking a return to Test cricket.<ref name=h107/> Barnes was known for being a somewhat eccentric self-promoter.<ref name=az>Cashman, pp. 27&ndash;33.</ref> During the 1948 tour, Barnes organised a multitude of business deals while not playing cricket,<ref name=h107/> and avoided paying customs [[Duty (economics)|duties]] on the enormous amount of goods he acquired in Britain by disembarking at Melbourne instead of Sydney.<ref>Smith, p. 130.</ref> 

Barnes then made himself unavailable for first-class cricket, preferring to pursue business interests instead, and ridiculed the fee paid for the 1949&ndash;50 tour of South Africa. He wrote a column for Sydney's ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]'', titled "Like It or Lump It", in which he often lampooned the administration of the game.<ref name="h107">Haigh and Frith, p. 107.</ref> 

However, in 1951&ndash;52, Barnes made a return to cricket, and sought selection in the national team to play the West Indies during the 1951&ndash;52 Australian season.<ref name=az/> Australia had been unable to find a reliable opener to accompany Barnes's former partner [[Arthur Morris]].<ref>Cashman, pp. 215&ndash;216.</ref><ref>Pollard (1990), p. 55.</ref> Australia's batsmen struggled in the first two Tests, and before the Third Test, Barnes scored 107 against Victoria, putting on 210 in partnership with Morris for New South Wales.<ref name=h107/> The ''Sporting Globe'' presciently predicted that the board would object if the selectors chose Barnes.<ref name=h107/>

Barnes was duly selected for the Third Test by a panel of three, chaired by his former captain Bradman, but the choice was vetoed by the Australian Board of Control "for reasons outside of cricket". Bradman was one of four board members to support Barnes's selection, while 10 objected, including Johnson.<ref name=h107/>

The matches took place and Barnes did not play. He was unable to find out why he had been excluded and was resigned to making an appearance before the board at its next meeting in September 1952 to ask for an explanation.<ref name=h108>Haigh and Frith, p. 108.</ref> 

In the meantime, the team was not announced at the scheduled time due to the delay caused by the veto. Journalists deduced the story and Barnes became a ''[[cause c<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>bre]]'' for many weeks, missing all of the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car,<ref name="Harte1">Harte, pp. 422&ndash;423.</ref> parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour.<ref name=h108/><ref>Pollard (1990), p. 57.</ref> In later years, a file of unknown authorship regarding Barnes's behaviour was deposited in the NSWCA library. It accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by cupping his hands over his eyes and showing dissent by implying that they were blind.<ref name=h107/> 

Barnes continued to score heavily, and during one match, he crossed paths with Johnson, who reportedly apologised to him for the exclusion from the team. However, Johnson advised Barnes to "keep quiet and say nothing" and added that "You will come out of it all right, you will be a certainty for the 1953 trip [to England]".<ref name=h108/>

On 24 April, a letter appeared in Sydney's ''Daily Mirror'' from Jacob Raith, a baker from Stanmore in Sydney, in response to a letter from Barnes's friend Stacy Atkin, which condemned the board for vetoing Barnes's selection.<ref>Barnes, p. 207.</ref> Raith's letter said that the board must have had good reason to exclude Barnes. 

{{quote|The board is an impartial body of cricket administrators made up of men who have given outstanding service to the game. It must be abundantly clear to all that they would not have excluded Mr Barnes from an Australian XI capriciously and only for some matter of a sufficiently serious nature. In declining to meet his request to publish reasons, the board may well be acting kindly towards him.<ref>Haigh and Frith, pp. 108&ndash;109.</ref>}}

The Board of Control had previously granted itself the power to exclude a player from the national team "on grounds other than cricket ability" following the poor behaviour of some members of the 1912 team that toured England.<ref>Harte, p. 256.</ref> Instead, Barnes sued Raith for libel and engaged a top Sydney lawyer, [[Jack Shand]]<U+2014>described by Haigh as "the foremost trial lawyer of his day"<U+2014><ref name=h109/> to represent him, with the aim of uncovering the reasons for his exclusion.<ref name=slee/> Bradman felt that Raith's letter was a premeditated set-up to give Barnes a pretext to instigate a trial.<ref name=h109/> The libel trial, held in August 1952, was a sensation, and Johnson, still a member of the board, was the central figure.<ref name=slee>Slee, pp. 216&ndash;217.</ref> According to Haigh, "it was effectively the Board, not Raith, in the dock".<ref name=h109>Haigh and Frith, p. 109.</ref>

It emerged very quickly during the trial that Raith had no particular knowledge of the workings of the board.<ref>Barnes, pp. 211&ndash;222.</ref> A series of administrators came forward to say that Barnes had reportedly misbehaved on the 1948 tour, even though Johnson's official report as manager had made no mention of any disharmony.<ref name=b216>Barnes, p. 216.</ref><ref name=h110>Haigh and Frith, p. 110.</ref> [[Aubrey Oxlade]], the chairman of the board and one of the four board members who voted to ratify Barnes's selection,<ref name=h109/> said that the batsman's indiscretions were "childish things" and "not serious at all".<ref name=h109/> Later, [[Frank Cush]], another board member who had supported Barnes's inclusion, replied "none at all" when asked if there were any legitimate reasons for excluding Barnes.<ref name=h110/> Selector [[Chappie Dwyer]] said "I have a very high opinion of him as a cricketer&nbsp;... and I have no objection to him as a man".<ref name=h110/>

Johnson was called as a witness,<ref name=h109/> and, under questioning from Shand, a different story came out.<ref name=h109/> Johnson agreed that his written report of the 1948 tour had said that the team had behaved "in a manner befitting worthy representatives of Australia" and that "on and off the field their conduct was exemplary".<ref name=b216/><ref name=h110/> However, in a verbal report, Johnson said he had drawn the board's attention to various misdemeanours by Barnes that, in his opinion, were sufficiently serious to warrant the player's exclusion from future Australian Test sides. Johnson said that Barnes had shown a "general reluctance for anything savouring of authority".<ref name=h110/> The misdeeds included taking pictures as the Australian team was presented to the royal family on the playing arena during the Test match at [[Lord's]], asking permission to travel alone in England (Barnes' family was living in Scotland at the time), and "abducting"  [[List of cricket terms#T|twelfth man]] [[Ernie Toshack]] to play tennis during the match at Northampton on a court "300 yards from the pavilion".<ref name=h109/><ref name=h110/> Under cross-examination, Johnson said that Barnes's taking pictures of the royal family at Lord's was the most serious of these misdemeanours. He admitted he had not known that Barnes had received permission from the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] and the royal family's protocol chief to take the photos. Shand also established that Barnes had then shown the films to raise money for various charities.<ref name=h109/> He further showed that Barnes had not agitated when reminded of the policy against players meeting with family members on tour.<ref name=h110/> However, Johnson believed that the cumulative effect of the misdeeds  "warranted omission from the team" and he saw no problem in the fact that his verbal advice to the board recommending Barnes' exclusion was at odds with the written report on the 1948 tour.<ref name=h110/> Under pressure from Shand, Johnson admitted that "I don't always write what I think".<ref name=h110/> According to Haigh, "Shand effortlessly twisted him [Johnson] inside out".<ref name=h110/>

*Shand: Will you admit one of two things: either your report to the Board or your statement that that was your state of mind, that you thought his conduct was so serious as to be left out of the team<U+2014>one or other is a deliberate lie?
*Johnson: No.
*Shand: Think what you are saying. One or other was a deliberate and wicked lie.
*Johnson: No.
*Shand: How could you really have thought that he had behaved in a manner befitting worthy representatives of Australia and on and off the field his conduct was exemplary if you thought his conduct was so serious as to warrant his omission from the team? How do you reconcile those two?
*Johnson: After a lot of thought.
*Shand: I am not asking for a lot of thought.
*Johnson: I have to report on the team as a whole, and that is my opinion.
*Shand: You admit that applies to every one of them.
*Johnson: Yes. 
*Shand: And yet one of them was guilty of conduct so serious in your opinion as to warrant his omission&nbsp;... These reports are circulated.
*Johnson: Yes.<ref name=h110/>
...
*Shand: And it would be a misleading report?
*Johnson: Yes.
*Shand: You still claim to be a responsible person?
*Johnson: Yes.
*Shand: You consider it is reasonable to mislead the various state associations?
*Johnson: In a case like that, yes.
*Shand: Depending on the circumstances you have no misgivings about misleading people?
*Johnson: I would not mislead people.
*Shand: You did, didn't you<U+2014>the state bodies, about Barnes?
*Johnson: Yes.<ref name=h110/>

Shand had nearly reduced Johnson to tears, having already caused a senior police officer to cry during the hearing of a royal commission the year before. A colleague of Shand's recalled his "capacity of insinuation in tone which could annoy and bring a witness into antagonism".<ref name=h110/> Shand then asked Johnson about a hypothetical case of Barnes being selected in the future. Johnson evaded the matter of whether he would select the player until Shand asked him to assume that "Barnes is in the best possible form and he is the best cricketer in Australia", to which Johnson replied in the negative.<ref name=h110/>

Johnson agreed that he had been a member of the NSWCA board that had appointed Barnes as captain of the state side. The libel trial collapsed on its second day, soon after Barnes had taken to the witness stand. Raith's counsel said it had been his task to prove a plea that the allegation in Raith's letter was true and that Barnes had not been excluded capriciously, and stated that "seldom in the history of libel actions has such a plea failed so completely and utterly."<ref>Barnes, p. 220.</ref> Raith's counsel issued Barnes with a public apology.<ref name=h111>Haigh and Frith, p. 111.</ref><ref>Pollard (1990), p. 58.</ref> According to fellow administrator [[Alan Barnes (cricket administrator)|Alan Barnes]], Johnson was a "wide-open type of bloke" who was vulnerable to manoeuvring.<ref name=d195/> Colleagues advised Johnson to hire a lawyer before the case started, but he refused, saying that the libel case was merely a sporting matter, not a legal one.<ref name=d195/>

===Aftermath===

After the libel trial, Johnson resigned from the board on 9 February 1953,<ref name=h112/> and played no further part in cricket administration in Australia.<ref name=wisdenobit/> He also resigned from the NSWCA and withdrew his candidature for the manager's position for the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1953|1953 tour of England]]. Philip Derriman wrote in his history of the NSWCA that Johnson "may be said to have been a victim of that affair no less than Barnes".<ref name=h112>Haigh and Frith, p. 112.</ref> Johnson wrote to the Australian Board of Control, ostensibly tendering his resignation on the grounds of difficulties in travelling to meetings,<ref name=d195>{{cite book |title= True to the Blue: A History of the New South Wales Cricket Association
|first=Philip |last=Derriman |publisher=Richard Smart Publishing |year=1985 |isbn=0958903808 |pages=194&ndash;195}}</ref> and thanking the other members for their "courtesy, cooperation and help".<ref name=h113/> He was not mentioned again in the board minutes again until his death was noted almost two decades later.<ref name=h113>Haigh and Frith, p. 113.</ref>

Johnson retained the support of many of the players: six Victorian members of the 1948 team, including [[Lindsay Hassett]], [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] and [[Neil Harvey]], wrote to the ''[[Herald Sun|Herald]]'' newspaper in Melbourne expressing their "confidence, respect and affection" for the tour manager. Derriman described Johnson as a "considerate, patient, inoffensive man for whom nothing was too much trouble. As a cricket official, he was efficient and dedicated."<ref name="Smith">Smith, p. 163. Quoted from Derriman, Phil. True to the Blue: A History of the NSW Cricket Association.</ref> Johnson was appointed a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to cricket in the 1964 [[Queen's Birthday Honours]],<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=43344|supp=yes|startpage=4975|date=1964-06-05|accessdate=2009-03-16}}</ref> and died in 1972 after collapsing when rising to make a speech at a charity lunch in Sydney.<ref name=wisdenobit/>
