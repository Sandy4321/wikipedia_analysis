[[Sanskrit]]: [[Devanagari]]: <U+0939><U+093F><U+092E><U+093E><U+0932><U+092F>, [[Urdu]]:<U+06C1><U+0645><U+0627><U+0644><U+06CC><U+06C1>, literally "abode of snow"), usually called the '''Himalayas''' or '''Himalaya''', is a [[mountain range]] immediately to the north of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. By extension, it can also refer to the massive mountain system that additionally includes the [[Karakoram]], the [[Hindu Kush]], and other lesser ranges that extend out from the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir Knot]]. Some of the world's major river systems arise in the Himalayas, and their combined [[drainage basin]]s are home to some 3.238 billion people (almost half of the Earth's population) in 18 countries. The Himalayas have profoundly shaped the cultures of [[South Asia]]; many Himalayan peaks are sacred in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Sikhism]].

Geologically, the Himalayas originate from the northward movement of the [[Indian Plate|Indian tectonic plate]] at 15&nbsp;cm{{fact|date=May 2012}} per year to impact the Eurasian continent, with first contact about 70 million years ago, and with movement continuing today. This caused the formation of the Himalayan arc peaks: the lighter rocks of the seabeds of that time were easily uplifted into mountains. An often-cited fact used to illustrate this process is that the summit of Mount Everest is made of marine [[limestone]].<ref>[http://geology.about.com/library/bl/peaks/bleverest.htm A site which uses this dramatic fact first used in illustration of "deep time" in John McPhee's book '''Basin and Range''']</ref>

The range consists of three coextensive sub-ranges, with the northernmost, and highest, known as the Great or Inner Himalayas.

==Ecology==
{{main|Ecology of the Himalaya}}
[[Image:yumthangnorth.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Himalayan range at Yumesongdong in [[Sikkim]], in the [[Yumthang]] River valley]]
The flora and fauna of the Himalayas vary with climate, rainfall, altitude, and soils. The climate ranges from tropical at the base of the mountains to permanent ice and snow at the highest elevations. Owing to the latitude near the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the permanent [[snow line]] is among the highest in the world at typically around {{convert|5500|m|ft|-2}} - for comparison, [[equator]]ial mountains in [[New Guinea]] and the [[Rwenzoris]] have a snow line some {{convert|900|m|ft|-1}} lower.{{contradict-inline|article=Snow line|date=August 2012}} The amount of yearly rainfall increases from west to east along the southern front of the range. This diversity of altitude, rainfall and soil conditions combined with the very high snow line supports a variety of distinct plant and animal communities. For example the extremes of high altitude (low atmospheric pressure) combined with extreme cold allow [[extremophile]] organisms to survive.<ref>C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Archaea?topic=49496 ''Archaea''. eds. E.Monosson & C.Cleveland, Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC.]</ref>

The unique floral and faunal wealth of the Himalayas is undergoing structural and compositional changes due to [[climate change]]. The increase in temperature may shift various species to higher elevations. The oak forest is being invaded by pine forests in the Garhwal Himalayan region. There are reports of early flowering and fruiting in some tree species, especially [[rhododendron]], [[apple]] and ''[[Myrica esculenta]]''. The medicinal properties of some important species may be affected by changing [[climate]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Kala|first=Chandra Prakash|title=Medicinal Plants and Sustainable Development|year=2011|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9781617619427|pages=280}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Kala|first=Chandra Prakash|title=Biodiversity, Communities and Climate Change|year=2012|publisher=Teri Publications|location=New Delhi|pages=358}}</ref>

==Geology==
[[Image:Himalaya-formation.gif|thumb|The 6,000 km plus journey of the India landmass (Indian Plate) before its collision with Asia (Eurasian Plate) about 40 to 50 million years ago]]
{{Main|Geology of the Himalaya}}

The Himalayas are among the youngest mountain ranges on the planet and consist mostly of uplifted [[sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rock]]. According to the modern theory of [[plate tectonics]], their formation is a result of a [[continental collision]] or [[orogeny]] along the [[convergent boundary]] between the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] and the [[Eurasian Plate]]. This is referred to as a [[fold mountain]].

The collision began in the [[Cretaceous|Upper Cretaceous]] period about 70 million years ago, when the north-moving [[Indo-Australian Plate]], moving at about 15&nbsp;cm per year, collided with the [[Eurasian Plate]]. About 50 million years ago, this fast moving Indo-Australian plate had completely closed the [[Tethys Ocean]], the existence of which has been determined by [[sedimentary rock]]s settled on the ocean floor, and the [[volcano]]es that fringed its edges. Since these sediments were light, they crumpled into mountain ranges rather than sinking to the floor. The Indo-Australian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the [[Tibetan plateau]], which forces the plateau to move upwards. The [[Arakan Yoma]] highlands in [[Myanmar]] and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]] were also formed as a result of this collision.

The Indo-Australian plate is still moving at 67&nbsp;mm per year, and over the next 10 million years it will travel about 1,500&nbsp;km into Asia. About 20&nbsp;mm per year of the India-Asia convergence is absorbed by [[Thrust fault|thrusting]] along the Himalaya southern front. This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5&nbsp;mm per year, making them geologically active. The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also makes this region [[seismic]]ally active, leading to [[earthquake]]s from time to time.

==Hydrology==
[[Image:Himalayan mountains from air 001.jpg|thumb|right|Glaciers near [[K2]] in the Xinjiang, China and [[Pakistan]].]]
The Himalayan range encompasses about 15,000 [[glacier]]s, which store about 12,000&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> (3000 cubic miles) of fresh water. The 70&nbsp;km-long [[Siachen Glacier]] at the India-Pakistan border is the second longest glacier in the world outside the polar region. Other famous glaciers include the [[Gangotri Glacier|Gangotri]] and [[Yamunotri]] ([[Uttarakhand]]), Nubra, [[Biafo Glacier|Biafo]] and [[Baltoro Glacier|Baltoro]] ([[Karakoram]] region), [[Zemu Glacier|Zemu]] ([[Sikkim]]) and [[Khumbu]] glaciers ([[Mount Everest]] region).

The higher regions of the Himalayas are snowbound throughout the year, in spite of their proximity to the [[tropics]], and they form the sources of several large [[perennial stream|perennial rivers]], most of which combine into two large river systems:
* The western rivers combine into the ''Indus Basin'', of which the [[Indus River]] is the largest. The Indus begins in [[Tibet]] at the confluence of Sengge and Gar rivers and flows southwest through [[India]] and then through [[Pakistan]] to the [[Arabian Sea]]. It is fed by the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]], the [[Chenab]], the [[Ravi River|Ravi]], the [[Beas River|Beas]], and the [[Sutlej]] rivers, among others.
* Most of the other Himalayan rivers drain the ''Ganges-Brahmaputra Basin''. Its two main rivers are the [[Ganges River|Ganges]] and the [[Brahmaputra]] and the [[Yamuna]], as well as other tributaries. The Brahmaputra originates as the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River (Tibet)|Yarlung Tsangpo River]] in western Tibet, and flows east through Tibet and west through the plains of [[Assam]]. The Ganges and the Brahmaputra meet in [[Bangladesh]], and drain into the [[Bay of Bengal]] through the world's largest [[river delta]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gits4u.com/wb/wb6a.htm|title=Sunderbans the world<U+2019>s largest delta|publisher=gits4u.com}}</ref>

The easternmost Himalayan rivers feed the [[Ayeyarwady River]], which originates in eastern Tibet and flows south through [[Myanmar]] to drain into the [[Andaman Sea]].

The [[Salween]], [[Mekong]], [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Huang He]] (Yellow River) all originate from parts of the [[Tibetan plateau]] that are geologically distinct from the Himalaya mountains, and are therefore not considered true Himalayan rivers. Some geologists refer to all the rivers collectively as the ''circum-Himalayan rivers''.<ref name=circum>{{cite journal

In recent years, scientists have monitored a notable increase in the rate of [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacier retreat]] across the region as a result of global [[climate change]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/42387/story.htm|title=Vanishing Himalayan Glaciers Threaten a Billion|date=June 5, 2007|publisher=Planet Ark|accessdate=2009-04-17}}</ref> For example, Glacial lakes have been forming rapidly on the surface of the debris-covered glaciers in the Bhutan Himalaya during the last few decades. Although the effect of this will not be known for many years, it potentially could mean disaster for the hundreds of millions of people who rely on the glaciers to feed the rivers of northern India during the dry seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90781/90879/6222327.html|title=Glaciers melting at alarming speed|date=July 24, 2007|publisher=People's Daily Online|accessdate=2009-04-17}}</ref>

===Lakes===
[[Image:Crows Lake in North Sikkim.jpg|thumb|250px|A high Himalayan lake at an altitude of around 5,000 metres [[Sikkim]], [[India]]]]

The Himalaya region is dotted with hundreds of lakes. Most lakes are found at altitudes of less than 5,000 m, with the size of the lakes diminishing with altitude. [[Pangong Tso]], which is spread across the border between India and China, and [[Yamdrok Tso]], located in central Tibet, are amongst the largest with surface areas of 700&nbsp;km<U+00B2>, and 638&nbsp;km<U+00B2>, respectively. Other notable lakes include [[Gurudogmar|Gurudogmar lake]]  in [[North Sikkim]], [[Tsongmo lake]], near the Indo-China border in Sikkim, and [[Tilicho lake]] in Nepal in the Annapurna massif.

The mountain lakes are known to geographers as ''[[tarn (lake)|tarns]]'' if they are caused by glacial activity. Tarns are found mostly in the upper reaches of the Himalaya, above 5,500 metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highestlake.com/highest-lake-world.html%7CThe Highest Lake in the World|first=Carl|last=Drews|accessdate=2010-11-14|title=Highest Lake in the World}}</ref>

==Impact on climate==
[[Image:Pass i n Ladakh.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pass in Ladakh with the typical Buddhist [[prayer flags]] and [[chorten]]]]
The Himalayas have a profound effect on the [[climate]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the [[Tibetan plateau]]. They prevent frigid, dry [[Arctic]] winds blowing south into the subcontinent, which keeps [[South Asia]] much warmer than corresponding [[temperate]] regions in the other continents. It also forms a barrier for the [[Monsoon of Indian subcontinent|monsoon]] winds, keeping them from traveling northwards, and causing heavy rainfall in the [[Terai]] region. The Himalayas are also believed to play an important part in the formation of [[Central Asia]]n [[deserts]], such as the [[Taklamakan]] and [[Gobi]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Devitt | first = Terry | title = Climate shift linked to rise of Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau | newspaper = [[University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Madison]] News | date = 3 May 2001 | url = http://www.news.wisc.edu/6138| accessdate = 1 November 2011}}</ref>

The mountain ranges also prevent western winter disturbances in [[Iran]] from traveling further, resulting in snow in [[Kashmir]] and rainfall in parts of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and northern India. Despite being a barrier to the cold, northerly winter winds, the Brahmaputra valley receives part of the frigid winds, thus lowering the temperature in the [[North East India]] and [[Bangladesh]].

The Himalayas, which are often called "The Roof of the World", contain the greatest area of glaciers and permafrost outside polar regions. Ten of Asia's largest rivers flow from here, and more than a billion people's livelihoods depend on them. To complicate matters, temperatures are rising more rapidly here than the global average. In Nepal, the temperature has risen 0.6 degree C over the last decade, whereas overall global warming has been around 0.7 degree C over the last hundred years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/asia/091208/nepal-glaciers-climate-change|first=Anna-Katarina|last=Gravgaard|date=2009-12-13|title=Nepalis note climate change|newspaper=Global Post}}</ref>

==Impact on politics and culture==
[[Image:yumthanghimalayas.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mountain sheds like these are used by the rural populace as shelter for cattle in summer months as they take them for grazing in higher altitudes.]]
Some of the world's major [[river]]s, the [[Ganges]], [[Indus]], [[Brahmaputra]], [[Yangtze]], [[Mekong]], [[Salween]], [[Red River (Asia)]], [[Xunjiang]], [[Chao Phraya]], [[Irrawaddy River]], [[Amu Darya]], [[Syr Darya]], [[Tarim River]] and [[Yellow River]], arise in the Himalayas, and their combined [[drainage basin]] is home to some 3 billion people (almost half of Earth's population) in [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[People's Republic of China]], [[India]] (almost half of the population of India live within 500&nbsp;km of the Himalayan range),{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, [[Nepal]], [[Burma]], [[Cambodia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Pakistan]].

The Himalayas, due to their large size and expanse, have been a natural barrier to the movement of people for tens of thousands of years. In particular, this has prevented intermingling of people from the [[Indian subcontinent]] with people from China and [[Mongolia]], causing significantly different languages and customs between these regions. The Himalayas have also hindered trade routes and prevented military expeditions across its expanse. For instance, [[Genghis Khan]] could not expand his empire south of the Himalayas into the subcontinent.

==Religion==
[[Image:Taktshang.jpg|250px|thumb|The [[Taktshang]] Monastery, also known as the "Tiger's Nest"]]

In Hinduism, the Himalaya have also been personified as the god [[Himavat]], the God of snow, who is mentioned in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''. He is father of [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganga]] and Saraswati, who became rivers, and [[Parvati]], who married [[Shiva]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend|isbn=0-500-51088-1|first=Anna|last=Dallapiccola|year=2002}}</ref>

Several places in the Himalaya are of religious significance in [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Buddhism]]. A notable example of a religious site is [[Paro Taktsang]],  where [[Padmasambhava]] is said to have founded Buddhism in [[Bhutan]].<ref name="Pommaret">{{cite book|author=Pommaret, Francoise|title=Bhutan Himlayan Mountains Kingdom|edition=5th|publisher=Odyssey Books and Guides|year=2006|pages=136<U+2013>7|isbn=978-9622178106}}</ref>

A number of [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] sites are situated in the Himalaya, including the residence of the [[Dalai Lama]]. There were over 6,000 [[List of Tibetan monasteries|monasteries]] in Tibet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7307495.stm|title=Tibetan monks: A controlled life|publisher=BBC News|date=March 20, 2008}}</ref> The [[Tibetan Muslims]] had their own mosques in [[Lhasa]] and [[Shigatse]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200510/27/eng20051027_217176.html|title=Mosques in Lhasa, Tibet|newspaper=People's Daily Online|date=October 27, 2005}}</ref>
