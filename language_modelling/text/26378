'''Personal digital assistants (PDAs)''' are [[handheld computer]]s, but have become much more versatile over the years.  PDAs are also known as '''[[small computer]]s''' or '''[[palmtop|palmtop computers]]'''.  PDAs have many uses: [[calculation]], use as a [[clock]] and [[calendar]], accessing the [[Internet]], sending and receiving [[E-mails]], [[video recording]], [[typewriting]] and [[word processing]], use as an [[address book]], making and writing on [[spreadsheets]], scanning [[bar codes]], use as a [[radio]] or [[stereo]], playing [[computer games]], recording survey responses, and [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS).  Newer PDAs also have both color screens and audio capabilities, enabling them to be used as [[mobile phone]]s ([[smartphones]]), [[web browser]]s, or [[portable media player]]s.  Many PDAs can access the [[Internet]], [[intranet]]s or [[extranet]]s via [[Wireless network|Wi-Fi]], or [[WWAN|Wireless Wide-Area Network]]s (WWANs).  Many PDAs employ [[touch screen]] technology.

==History==

The term "personal data assistant" was first used on [[January 7]], [[1992]] by [[Apple Computer]] [[CEO]] [[John Sculley]] at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], referring to the [[Apple Newton]].  PDAs are sometimes referred to as "Palms", "Palm Pilot" or "Palm Tops".

==Typical features==
Currently, a typical PDA has a touch screen for entering data, a memory card slot for data storage and at least one of the following for connectivity:  IrDA, Bluetooth and/or WiFi.  However, many PDAs (typically those used primarily as telephones) may not have a touch screen, using softkeys, a directional pad and either the numeric keypad or a thumb keyboard for input.

Software typically required to be a PDA includes an appointment calendar, a to-do list, an address book for contacts and some sort of note program.  Connected PDAs also typically include E-mail and Web support.
===Touch screen===
Many original PDAs, such as the [[Apple Newton]] and the [[Palm Pilot]], featured [[touch screens]] for user interaction, having only a few buttons usually reserved for shortcuts to often used programs.  Touch screen PDAs, including [[Windows Pocket PC]] devices, usually have a detachable [[Stylus#Modern use|stylus]] that can be used on the touch screen.  Interaction is then done by tapping the screen to activate buttons or menu choices, and dragging the stylus to, for example, highlight.
Text input is usually done in one of four ways:
*Using a [[virtual keyboard]], where a keyboard is shown on the touch screen.  Input is done by tapping letters on the screen.
*Using external [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] or [[chorded keyboard]] connected by [[USB]] or [[Bluetooth]].
*Using [[Handwriting recognition|letter or word recognition]], where letters or words are written on the touch screen, and then "translated" to letters in the currently activated text field.  Despite rigorous research and development projects, end-users experience mixed results with this input method, with some finding it frustrating and inaccurate, while others are satisfied with the quality.<ref>HWR accuracy:

* Stroke recognition (termed Graffiti by Palm).  In this system a predefined set of strokes are defined to represent the various characters needed. The user learns to draw these strokes on the screen or in an input area.  The strokes are often simplified character shapes to make them easier to remember.

PDAs for business use, including the [[BlackBerry]] and [[Treo]], have full keyboards and scroll wheels or thumb wheels to facilitate data entry and navigation, in addition to supporting touch-screen input.  There are also full-size foldable keyboards available that plug directly, or use wireless technology to interface with the PDA and allow for normal typing.  [[BlackBerry]] also has additional functionality as push based email and applications.

Newer PDAs, such as the Apple [[iPhone]] include new user interfaces using other means of input.  The iPhone uses a technology called [[Multi-touch]].

===Memory cards===

Although many early PDAs did not have [[memory card]] slots, now most have either an SD ([[Secure Digital]]) and/or a [[Compact Flash]] slot.  Although originally designed for memory, [[SDIO]] and Compact Flash cards are available for such things as Wi-Fi and Webcams.  Some PDAs also have a [[USB]] port, mainly for [[USB flash drives]].

As more PDAs include telephone support, to keep the size down, many now offer miniSD or microSD slots instead of full-sized SD slots.

===Wired connectivity===
While many earlier PDAs connected via [[serial port]]s or other proprietary format, many today connect via USB cable.  This served primarily to connect to a computer, and few, if any PDAs were able to connect to ''each other'' out of the box using cables, as USB requires one machine to act as a host - functionality which was not often planned.  Some PDAs were able to connect to the internet, either by means of one of these cables, or by using an extension card with an [[ethernet]] port/[[RJ-45]] adaptor.

===Wireless connectivity===

Most modern PDAs have [[Bluetooth]] wireless connectivity, an increasingly popular tool for mobile devices.  It can be used to connect keyboards, headsets, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and many other accessories, as well as sending files between PDAs. Many mid-range and superior PDAs have [[Wi-Fi]]/[[WLAN]]/[[IEEE 802.11|802.11]]-connectivity, used for connecting to Wi-Fi hotspots or wireless networks.  Older PDAs predominantly have an [[IrDA]] ([[infrared]]) port; however fewer current models have the technology, as it is slowly being phased out due to support for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.  IrDA allows communication between two PDAs: a PDA and any device with an [[IrDA]] port or adapter.  Most universal PDA keyboards use infrared technology because many older PDAs have it, and infrared technology is low-cost and has the advantage of being permitted aboard aircraft.

===Synchronization===
An important function of PDAs is synchronizing data with a PC. This allows up-to-date contact information stored on software such as [[Microsoft Outlook]] or [[ACT!]] to update the database on the PDA.  The data synchronization ensures that the PDA has an accurate list of contacts, appointments and e-mail, allowing users to access the same information on the PDA as the host computer.

The synchronizing also prevents the loss of information stored on the device in case it is lost, stolen, or destroyed. Another advantage is that data input is usually a lot quicker on a PC, since text input via a touch screen is still not quite optimal. Transferring data to a PDA via the computer is therefore a lot quicker than having to manually input all data on the handheld device.

Most PDAs come with the ability to synchronize to a PC. This is done through synchronization software provided with the handheld, such as HotSync Manager, which comes with Palm OS handhelds, Microsoft ActiveSync for older versions of Windows or Windows Mobile Device Center on Windows Vista, which comes with Windows Mobile handhelds.

These programs allow the PDA to be synchronized with a [[Personal information manager]].  This personal information manager may be an outside program or a proprietary program. For example, the BlackBerry PDA comes with the Desktop Manager program which can synchronize to both [[Microsoft Outlook]] and [[ACT!]]. Other PDAs come only with their own proprietary software.  For example, some early Palm OS PDAs came only with Palm Desktop while later Palms such as the Treo 650 has the built-in ability to sync to Palm Desktop and/or Microsoft Outlook, while Microsoft's ActiveSync and Windows Mobile Device Center only synchronize with Microsoft Outlook or a Microsoft Exchange server.

Third-party synchronization software is also available for many PDAs from companies like [[Intellisync]] and CompanionLink. This software synchronizes these handhelds to other personal information managers which are not supported by the PDA manufacturers, such as [[GoldMine]] and [[Lotus Notes]].

===Customization===
As with [[personal computers]], it is possible to install additional software on most PDAs. Software can be bought or downloaded from the Internet, allowing users to personalize their PDAs to their liking. An example of this would be the display theme for the PDA. Almost all PDAs also allow for adding some form of hardware.  The most common is a memory card slot, which allows the users to get additional and exchangeable storage space on their handheld devices.  There are also miniature keyboards that can be connected to most mainstream PDAs for quicker text input. PDAs with [[Bluetooth]] use Bluetooth-enabled devices like headsets, mice and (possibly foldable) keyboards.

==Uses==
PDAs are used to store information that can be accessed at any time and any where.

===Automobile navigation===
Many PDAs are used in car kits and are fitted with differential [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) receivers to provide realtime automobile navigation.  PDAs are increasingly being fitted as standard on new cars.

Many systems can also display traffic conditions, dynamic routing and roadside mobile radar guns.  Popular software in Europe for this functionality are [[TomTom]], [[Garmin]], [[iGO]] etc. showing road conditions and 2D or 3D environments.

===Ruggedized PDAs===
For many years businesses and government organizations have relied upon rugged PDAs for mobile data applications. Typical applications include supply chain management in warehouses, package delivery, route accounting, medical treatment and record keeping in hospitals, facilities maintenance and management, parking enforcement, access control and security, capital asset maintenance, meter reading by utilities, and "wireless waitress" applications in restaurants and hospitality venues.

===Medical and scientific uses===
{{Unreferencedsection|date=May 2007}}
In medicine, PDAs have been shown to aid diagnosis and drug selection and some studies have concluded that their use by patients to record symptoms improves the effectiveness of communication with hospitals during follow-up.  The first landmark study in testing the effectiveness of PDAs in a medical setting was conducted at the Brigham & Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospitals in affiliation with Harvard Medical School.  Led by the team of Steven Labkoff, MD and Sandeep Shah, the Constellation project used Apple's [[Apple Newton|Newton]] (first PDA in the market) to cater to the demands of the medical professionals.<p>
Constellation's objective was to test how clinicians in various medical environments (wired vs un wired) would use medical reference books on a hand-held device.  The study validated the hypothesis that PDAs with medical content would be used to a greater degree (>40% more often) in unwired environments.<p>
Today, the company evolved from the effort Skyscape offers a wide range of resources including drug information, treatment options, guidelines, evidence based information and journal summaries including the drug & safety alerts.  Other entrants include [[Epocrates]] and ABX guide, which supply drug databases, treatment information and relevant news in formats specific to mobile devices and services such as [[AvantGo]] translate medical journals into readable formats and provide updates from journals. WardWatch organizes medical records to remind doctors making ward rounds of information such as the treatment regimens of patients and programs. Finally, Pendragon and Syware provide tools for conducting research with mobile devices, and  connecting to a central server allowing the user to enter data into a centralized database using their PDA. Additionally, Microsoft Visual Studio and Sun Java provide programming tools for developing survey instruments on the handheld. These development tools allow for integration with SQL databases that are stored on the handheld and can be synchronized with a desktop/server based database.

Recently the development of [[Sensor Web]] technology has led to discussion of using wearable bodily sensors to monitor ongoing conditions like diabetes and epilepsy and alerting medical staff or the patient themselves to the treatment required via communication between the web and PDAs.

===Educational uses===
{{POV-section|date=December 2007}}
{{Essay-like|date=December 2007}}
As mobile technology has become almost a necessity, it is no surprise that personal computing has become a vital learning tool by this time. Educational institutes have commenced a trend of integrating PDAs into their teaching practices ([[mobile learning]]).  With the capabilities of PDAs, teachers are now able to provide a collaborative learning experience for their students. They are also preparing their students for possible practical uses of mobile computing upon their graduation.

PDAs and handheld devices have recently allowed for digital note taking. This has increased student<U+2019>s productivity by allowing individuals to quickly spell-check, modify, and amend their class notes or e-notes.  Educators are currently able to distribute course material through the use of the internet connectivity or infrared file sharing functions of the PDA.  With concerns to class material, textbook publishers have begun to release e-books, or electronic textbooks, which can be uploaded directly to a PDA.  This then lessens the effort of carrying multiple textbooks at one time.

To meet the instructive needs sought by educational institutes, software companies have developed programs with the learning aspects in mind.   Simple programs such as dictionaries, thesauri, and [[word processing]] software are important to the digital note taking process.  In addition to these simple programs, encyclopedias and digital planning lessons have created added functionality for users.

With the increase in mobility of PDAs, school boards and educational institutes have now encountered issues with these devices.  School boards are now concerned with students utilizing the internet connectivity to share test answers or to gossip during class time, which creates disruptions.  Many school boards have modernized their computer policies to address these new concerns.  Software companies such as [[Scantron]] Corp. have now created a program for distributing digital quizzes.  The quiz software disables the infrared function on PDAs, which eliminates the element of information sharing among individuals during the examination.[http://www.cnn.com/2003/EDUCATION/09/21/sprj.sch.classroom.gadgets.ap/index.html]

===Sporting uses===
PDAs are used by [[gliding|glider pilots]] for pre-flight planning and to assist navigation in cross-country competitions.  They are linked to a [[global positioning system|GPS]] to produce moving-map displays showing the tracks to turn-points, airspace hazards and other tactical information.

PDA's can be used by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_rally] road rally enthusiasts.  PDA software can be used for calculating distance, speed, time, and GPS navigation as well as unassisted navigation.

===Blind people use===
It is almost impossible to work on a PDA for a blind person because most of the controlls are touchscreen and you need to see the screen in order to operate the device.

With help of special PDAs blind people can work and entertain themselves; listen to music, chat with MSN Messenger and browse the internet - very amusing feature considering absence of any display. All operations are done using voice commands and buttons <U+2013> the control scheme was simplified to make controlling PDA easier.<ref>[http://www.gadgets-reviews.com/pda-for-blind-people.html PDAs for blind people]</ref>

==Technical details==
===Architecture===
Many PDAs run using a variation of the [[ARM architecture]] (usually denoted by the [[Intel]] [[XScale]] [[trademark]]).  This encompasses a class of [[RISC]] [[microprocessor]]s that are widely used in [[Mobile computing|mobile devices]] and [[embedded system]]s, and its design was influenced strongly by a popular [[1970s]]/[[1980s]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], the [[MOS Technology 6502]].

===OS===
The currently major PDA [[operating system]]s are:
*[[Palm OS]] - owned by [[PalmSource]] 
*[[Windows Mobile]] Professional and Classic for use on [[Pocket PC]]s, (based on the [[Windows CE]] kernel) - owned by [[Microsoft]]
*[[BlackBerry]] OS - owned by [[Research In Motion]]
*Many operating systems based on the [[Linux]] kernel - [[Free software|free]] (not owned by any company) These include
**[[Familiar Linux|Familiar]] (comes in three flavours: [[GPE Palmtop Environment|GPE]], [[OPIE user interface|Opie]] and barebone)
**[[OpenZaurus]] (for [[Zaurus|Zaurus PDAs]])
**Intimate (for PDAs with an exceedingly large amount of memory)
*[[Symbian OS]] (formerly [[EPOC (computing)|EPOC]]) owned by [[Motorola]], [[Panasonic]], [[Nokia]], [[Samsung]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] and [[Sony Ericsson]]

==Decreasing popularity?==
{{accuracy|Study details needed}}

PDA sales fell 43.5% from 2006 to 2007.  Approximately 4 million PDAs are sold per year, while [[smartphone]] sales are approximately 60 million per year.

According to a [[Gartner]] [[market]] study, the overall market for PDAs grew by 20.7% in the third [[fiscal year|quarter]] (Q3) of [[2005]], compared to Q3 [[2004]], with marketshare resolving as follows (by operating system):{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
*[[Palm OS]] for Palm, Inc. PDAs and some other [[List of PalmOS Devices|licensees]]- 14.9% (declining)
*[[Windows Mobile]] for PDAs that comply with the Microsoft's [[Pocket PC]] specifications - 49.2% (increasing)
*[[BlackBerry|RIM BlackBerry]] for [[BlackBerry|BlackBerry PDA]] (produced by [[Research In Motion]]) - 25.0% (increasing)
*Symbian OS - 5.8% (increasing)
*Various operating systems based on the [[Linux]] kernel for [http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT8728350077.html various special designed PDAs] ([http://tuxmobil.org/pda_linux.html many other supported]) - 0.7% (stable)
*Other - 4.4% (stable)

==Shortcomings==
Perhaps, more than any other computer devices, the PDA lacks the fully-blown infrastructure of a Wireless Broadband network.  This could be offered in future by [[WiMax]].
Nowadays prices of [[laptop]]s are coming down. Though somewhat bigger in size, laptops have better visibility and are more powerful.  However, the [[OQO]] [[OQO Model 2|Model 2]] has been released as an [[IBM-PC compatible]] PDA with a USB port so that people can play computer games from ubiquitous operating systems such as [[Windows XP]] and connect typical PC peripherals.
