'''Paul Rand''' (born '''Peretz Rosenbaum''', [[August 15]], [[1914]] &ndash; [[November 26]], [[1996]]) was a well-known [[United States|American]] [[graphic design]]er, best known for his corporate [[Logotype|logo]] designs. Rand was educated at the [[Pratt Institute]] (1929&ndash;1932), the [[Parsons School of Design]] (1932&ndash;1933), and the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] (1933&ndash;1934). He was one of the originators of the [[Swiss Style]] of graphic design. From 1956 to 1969, and beginning again in 1974, Rand taught design at [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. Rand was inducted into the New York [[Art Directors Club]] Hall of Fame in 1972. He designed many posters and corporate identities, including the logos for [[IBM]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Rand died of cancer in 1996.

==Early life and education ==
Peretz Rosenbaum was born in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]] in [[1914]].<ref name="behrens">Behrens, Roy. <U+201C>Paul Rand.<U+201D> ''Print'', Sept&ndash;Oct. 1999: 68+</ref>  As [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] law forbade the creation of images, the very idea of artistry was a sacrilegious act of rebellion. It was one that he embraced at a very young age, painting signs for his father<U+2019>s grocery store as well as for school events at P.S. 109.<ref name="heller">[[Steven Heller (graphic design)|Heller, Steven]]. <U+201C>Thoughts on Rand.<U+201D> ''Print'', May&ndash;June 1997: 106&ndash;109+</ref>  Rand<U+2019>s father did not believe art could provide his son with a sufficient livelihood, and so he required Paul to attend Manhattan<U+2019>s Harren High School while taking night classes at the [[Pratt Institute]], though <U+201C>neither of these schools offered Rand much stimulation."<ref name="heller"/>  Despite studying at Pratt and other institutions in the New York area (including [[Parsons School of Design]] and the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]]), Rand was by-and-large <U+201C>self-taught as a designer, learning about the works of [[Cassandre]] and [[L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> Moholy-Nagy|Moholy-Nagy]] from European magazines such as ''Gebrausgraphic''.<U+201D><ref name="beirut2">[[Michael Bierut|Bierut, Michael]]. <U+201C>Tribute: Paul Rand 1914&ndash;1996.<U+201D> ''ID'', Jan&ndash;Feb. 1997: 34</ref>

==Early career==
His career began with humble assignments, starting with a part-time position creating [[stock image]]s for a syndicate that supplied graphics to various newspapers and magazines.<ref name="heller"/>  Between his class assignments and his work, Rand was able to amass a fairly large portfolio, largely influenced by the [[Germany|German]] advertising style [[Sachplakat]] (ornamental poster) as well as the works of [[Gustav Jensen]].  It was at around this time that he decided to shed the Jewish stigma associated with <U+2018>Peretz Rosenbaum,<U+2019> shortening his forename to <U+2018>Paul<U+2019> and taking <U+2018>Rand<U+2019> from an uncle to form his new surname. [[Morris Wyszogrod]], a friend and associate of Rand, noted that <U+201C>he figured that <U+2018>Paul Rand,<U+2019> four letters here, four letters there, would create a nice symbol.  So he became Paul Rand."<ref name="behrens"/> Peter Behrens notes the importance of this new title: <U+201C>Rand<U+2019>s new persona, which served as the brand name for his many accomplishments, was the first corporate identity he created, and it may also eventually prove to be the most enduring."<ref name="behrens"/>  Indeed, Rand was rapidly moving into the forefront of his profession.  In his early twenties he was producing work that began to garner international acclaim, notably his designs on the covers of ''Direction'' magazine, which Rand produced for no fee in exchange for full artistic freedom.<ref name="heller"/>  Among the accolades Rand received were those of Moholy-Nagy:

:Among these young Americans it seems to be that Paul Rand is one of the best and most capable [. . .] He is a painter, lecturer, industrial designer, [and] advertising artist who draws his knowledge and creativeness from the resources of this country.  He is an idealist and a realist, using the language of the poet and business man.  He thinks in terms of need and function.  He is able to analyze his problems but his fantasy is boundless.<ref name="heller"/>

The reputation Rand so rapidly amassed in his prodigious twenties never dissipated; rather, it only managed to increase through the years as the designer<U+2019>s influential works and writings firmly established him as the ''<U+00E9>minence grise'' of his profession.<ref name="beirut2"/>

[[Image:paul_rand_direction.png|thumb|left|'''Figure A:''' ''Direction'' Dec. 1940 cover.]]Although Rand<U+2019>s fame has been largely established by the [[corporate identity]] solutions he created in the 1950s and 1960s, his early work in [[Typesetting|page design]] was the initial source of his reputation.  In 1936, Rand was given the job of setting the page layout for an ''Apparel Arts'' magazine anniversary issue.<ref name="heller"/>  <U+201C>His remarkable talent for transforming mundane photographs into dynamic compositions, which [. . .] gave editorial weight to the page<U+201D> earned Rand a full-time job, as well as an offer to take over as art director for the [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]-[[Coronet (magazine)|Coronet]] magazines. Initially, Rand refused this offer, claiming that he was not yet at the level the job required, but a year later he decided to go ahead with it, taking over responsibility for Esquire<U+2019>s fashion pages at the young age of twenty-three.  

The cover art for ''Direction'' magazine proved to be an important step in the development of the <U+201C>Paul Rand look<U+201D> that was not as yet fully developed.<ref name="heller"/>  The December 1940 cover (''See Figure A''), which uses [[barbed wire]] to present the magazine as both a war-torn gift and a crucifix, is indicative of the [[artistic freedom]] Rand enjoyed at ''Direction''; in ''Thoughts on Design'' Rand notes that it <U+201C>is significant that the crucifix, aside from its religious implications, is a demonstration of pure plastic form as well . . . a perfect union of the aggressive vertical (male) and the passive horizontal (female)."<ref name="rand2">Rand, Paul. ''Thoughts on Design.'' New York: Wittenborn: 1947.</ref> In ways such as this, Rand was experimenting with the introduction of themes normally found in the <U+201C>high arts<U+201D> into his new graphic design, further advancing his life-long goal of bridging the gap between his profession and that of Europe<U+2019>s modernist masters.

==Corporate identities==
[[Image:Eye-Bee-M-Poster.jpg|thumb|right|'''Figure B''': ''Eye Bee M'' poster designed by Paul Rand in early 1970s for [[IBM]].]]
Indisputably, Rand<U+2019>s most widely known contribution to graphic design are his [[Corporate Identity|corporate identities]], many of which are still in use. [[IBM]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[Cummins Engine]], [[Westinghouse]], and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], among many others, owe their graphical heritage to him, though UPS recently carried out a controversial update to the classic Rand design.<ref name="beirut2"/>  One of his primary strengths, as Maholy-Nagy pointed out, was his ability as a salesman to explain the needs his identities would address for the corporation.  According to graphic designer [[Louis Danziger]]:
:He almost singlehandedly convinced business that design was an effective tool. [. . .] Anyone designing in the 1950s and 1960s owed much to Rand, who largely made it possible for us to work.  He more than anyone else made the profession reputable.  We went from being commercial artists to being graphic designers largely on his merits.<ref name="heller"/>
Rand<U+2019>s defining corporate identity was his IBM logo in 1956, which as Mark Favermann notes <U+201C>was not just an identity but a basic design philosophy that permeated corporate consciousness and public awareness."<ref name="favermann">Favermann, Mark. <U+201C>Two Twentieth-Century Icons.<U+201D> ''Art New England'' Apr&ndash;May 1997: 15.</ref> The logo was modified by Rand in 1960, and the striped logo in 1972. Rand also designed packaging and marketing materials for IBM from the early 1970s until the early 1980s, including the well known Eye-Bee-M poster (''See Figure B'').  [[Ford]] appointed Rand in the 1960s to redesign their corporate logo, but afterwards chose not to use his modernized design (''See Figure C''). 

[[Image:rand_ford.gif|thumb|left|'''Figure C''': Unimplemented logo designed by Rand for [[Ford]].]]Although his logos may be interpreted as simplistic, Rand was quick to point out in ''A Designer<U+2019>s Art'' that <U+201C>ideas do not need to be esoteric to be original or exciting."<ref name="rand2"/>  His American Broadcasting Company trademark<!-- (see fig. ''to be added'')-->, created in 1962, epitomizes that ideal of minimalism while proving Rand<U+2019>s point that a logo <U+201C>cannot survive unless it is designed with the utmost simplicity and restraint.<U+201D><ref name="rand2"/>  Rand remained vital as he aged, continuing to produce important corporate identities into the eighties and nineties with a rumored $100,000 price per single solution.<ref name="beirut2"/> The most notable of his later works was his collaboration with [[Steve Jobs]] for the [[NeXT|NeXT Computer]] corporate identity<!-- (see fig. ''to be added'')-->; Rand<U+2019>s simplistic black box breaks the company name into two lines, producing a visual harmony that endeared the logogram to Jobs.  If ever there was a pleased client, it was indeed Steve Jobs: just prior to Rand<U+2019>s death in 1996, his former client labeled him, simply, <U+201C>the greatest living graphic designer.<U+201D><ref name="behrens"/>{{-}}

==Influences and other works==

===Development of theory===

Though Rand was a reclusive loner in his creative process, doing the vast majority of the design load despite having a large staff at varying points in his career, he was very interested in producing books of theory to illuminate his philosophies.  Maholy-Nagy may have incited Rand<U+2019>s zeal for knowledge when he asked his colleague if he read art criticism at their first meeting.  Rand said no, prompting Maholy-Nagy to reply <U+201C>Pity.<U+201D><ref name="heller"/>  Heller elaborates on this meeting's impact, noting that, <U+201C>from that moment on, Rand devoured books by the leading philosophers on art, including [[Roger Fry]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and [[John Dewey]]."  These theoreticians would have a lasting impression on Rand<U+2019>s work; in a 1995 interview with Michael Kroeger discussing, among other topics, the importance of Dewey<U+2019>s ''Art as Experience'', Rand elaborates on Dewey<U+2019>s appeal:

:Rand: [. . . ''Art as Experience''] deals with everything -- there is no subject he does not deal with. That is why it will take you one hundred years to read this book. Even today's philosophers talk about it[.] [E]very time you open this book you find good things. I mean the philosophers say this, not just me. You read this, then when you open this up next year, that you read something new.<ref>Kroeger, Michael. Interview with Paul Rand. MK Graphic Design. 8 Feb. 1995. 15 Feb. 2006 <http://www.mkgraphic.com/paulrand.html></ref>.

As is obvious, Dewey is an important source for Rand<U+2019>s underlying sentiment in graphic design; on page one of Rand<U+2019>s groundbreaking ''Thoughts on Design'', the author begins drawing lines from Dewey<U+2019>s philosophy to the need for <U+201C>functional-aesthetic perfection<U+201D> in modern art.  Among the ideas Rand pushed in ''Thoughts on Design'' was the practice of creating graphic works capable of retaining their recognizable quality even after being blurred or mutilated (''see Figure D''), a test Rand routinely performed on his corporate identities.<ref name="rand2"/>

====Criticism====

Despite the prestige graphic designers place on his first book, subsequent works, notably From ''Lascaux to Brooklyn'' (1996), earned Rand accusations of being <U+201C>reactionary and hostile to new ideas about design.<U+201D><ref name="heller"/>  Heller defends Rand<U+2019>s later ideas, calling the designer <U+201C>an enemy of mediocrity, a radical modernist<U+201D> while Mark Favermann considers the period one of <U+201C>a reactionary, angry old man.<U+201D><ref name="heller"/><ref>Favermann, Mark. <U+201C>Two Twentieth-Century Icons.<U+201D> ''Art New England'' Apr&ndash;May 1997: 15</ref>  Regardless of this dispute, Rand<U+2019>s contribution to modern graphic design theory in total is widely considered intrinsic to the profession<U+2019>s development.

===Modernist influences===

Undoubtedly, the core ideology that drove Rand<U+2019>s career, and hence his lasting influence, was the modernist philosophy he so revered.  He celebrated the works of artists from [[Paul C<U+00E9>zanne]] to [[Jan Tschichold]], and constantly attempted to draw the connections between their creative output and significant applications in graphic design.  In A Designer<U+2019>s Art Rand clearly demonstrates his appreciation for the underlying connections:

:From Impressionism to Pop Art, the commonplace and even the comic strip have become ingredients for the artist<U+2019>s caldron.  What Cezanne did with apples, Picasso with guitars, L<U+00E9>ger with machines, Schwitters with rubbish, and Duchamp with urinals makes it clear that revelation does not depend upon grandiose concepts.  The problem of the artist is to defamiliarize the ordinary.<ref name="rand1">Rand, Paul. ''Paul Rand: A Designer<U+2019>s Art.'' New Haven: Yale University Press, 1985</ref>

This idea of <U+201C>defamiliarizing the ordinary<U+201D> played an important part in Rand<U+2019>s design choices.  Working with manufacturers provided him the challenge of utilizing his corporate identities to create <U+201C>lively and original<U+201D> packaging for mundane items, such as light bulbs for [[Westinghouse]]. <ref name="rand2"/>
