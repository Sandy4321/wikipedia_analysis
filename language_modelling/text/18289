==Early life==
Bhindranwale was born in the village of Rode, in the [[Faridkot District]] located in the region of [[Malwa (Punjab)]]. His father, Joginder Singh, was a farmer and a local Sikh leader.<ref name="SH"/> Jarnail Singh was the seventh of eight brothers. He was brought up as a strict [[vegetarian]].<ref name="IT">{{cite news|title= An India Today-100 People Who Shaped India|publisher=''[[India Today]]''|last=Singh|first=Tavleen|date=2002-01-14|url=http://www.india-today.com/itoday/millennium/100people/jarnail.html|accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref>  In 1965, he was enrolled by his father at the [[Damdami Taksal]], a religious school, near [[Moga, Punjab]], then headed by  Gurbachan Singh Khalsa.<ref name="SH"/> After a one year course in Sikh studies he returned to farming again. He continued his studies under Kartar Singh, who was the new head of the Taksal. He quickly became the favourite student of Kartar Singh.<ref>{{cite book | last=Deol| first=Harnik | title=Religion and Nationalism in India: The Case of the Punjab| publisher=Routledge
 | location= | year =2000 |isbn=041520108X | pages=168 }}</ref> Kartar Singh was fatally injured in a car accident and nominated Bhindranwale as his successor, in preference to his son Amrik Singh. Amrik Singh later became close associate of Bhindranwale.<ref>{{cite book | last=Tully | first=Mark |authorlinks=[[Mark Tully]]| coauthors=Satish Jacob|title=Amritsar: Mrs Gandhi's Last Battle| publisher=[[Jonathan Cape]] | location=London | year = 1985|isbn=0-224-02328-4 | pages=54}}</ref>

He married Pritam Kaur, daughter of Sucha Singh of [[Bilaspur, Yamuna Nagar|Bilaspur]].<ref name="SH"/> His wife bore him two sons, Ishar and Inderjit Singh, in 1971 and 1975, respectively.<ref name="SH"/> Pritam Kaur died of heart ailment at age 60, on September 15, 2007 in Jalandhar.<ref>{{cite news|title= Bhindranwale's widow dead|publisher=''[[The Tribune]]''|last=|first=|date=2007-09-16|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20070916/punjab1.htm#20|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref>

==Rise to popularity==
In Punjab, Bhindranwale went from village to village as a [[missionary]] and asked people to live according to the rules and tenets of [[Sikhism]]. He preached to disaffected young Sikhs, encouraging them to return to the path of [[Khalsa]] by giving up vices like sex, drugs, alcohol and tobacco.<ref>{{cite book |title=Soft target: the real story behind the Air India disaster|last=Kashmeri |first=Zuhair|coauthors=Brian McAndrew |year=2005 |publisher=James Lorimer & Company |location= |isbn=1550289047 |page=40|chapter=Section 3}}</ref> His focus on fighting for the Sikh cause made appealed to many young Sikhs. Due to his religious background{{Dubious|date=November 2008}} as a preacher, his followers formally called him ''Bhindranwale Mahapurkh'', which meant "The Great Man from Bhindran". Bhindranwale became the new leader of the [[Damdami Taksal]] when Kartar Singh Khalsa, the successor to Gurbachan Singh Khalsa, who died in a road accident on August 16, 1977, nominated Bhindranwale.<ref name="SH"/> Bhindranwale was formally elected at a [[bhog]] ceremony at Mehta Chowk on August 25, 1977.<ref name="SH"/>

Bhindranwale participated in some behind-the-scene political work. In 1979, Bhindranwale put up forty candidates in the SGPC elections for a total of 140 seats, he lost all seats except 4.<ref>{{cite book | last=Singh |first=Khushwant | year=2005 | month= | title=A History of the Sikhs: Volume II: 1839-2004 | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | location=[[New Delhi]] | isbn=0195673093 | pages=332 }}</ref> A year later, Bhindranwale campaigned actively for Congress in three constituencies' during the general elections.<ref>Tully (1985), p177.</ref> Due to his lack of success in election politics, he later claimed he did not personally seek any political offices. As stated in a 1984 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' article, Bhindranwale's popularity reached a peak that he overthrew the authority of the [[Shiromani Akali Dal]], a [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]-based [[Sikh]] [[political party]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lopez |first=Laura |year=1984 |month=June |title=India, Diamonds and the Smell of Death |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|volume= |issue=June 25, 1984 }}</ref> Bhindranwale wielded a great deal of power, and the political factions within Punjab could not commit any major action without considering Bhindranwale's reaction.<ref>{{cite book | last=Robin |first=Jeffrey| year=1994 | month= |edition=2nd| title=What's Happening to India? | publisher=Holmes & Meier Publishing| location=New York | isbn=0841913501 | pages=146<U+2013>147 }}</ref>

Bhindranwale was widely perceived to be a supporter for the creation of a proposed Sikh majority state of [[Khalistan]]. However, in a BBC interview, he stated that if the government agreed to the creation of such a state, he would not refuse. Other quotes attributed to Bhindranwale on Khalistan include "we are not in favour of Khalistan nor are we against it". Responding to the formation of Khalistan he is quoted as saying, "I don't oppose it nor do I support it. We are silent. However, one thing is definite that if this time the Queen of India does give it to us, we shall certainly take it. We won't reject it. We shall not repeat the mistake of 1947. As yet, we do not ask for it. It is Indira Gandhi's business and not mine, nor Longowal's, nor of any other of our leaders. It is Indira's business. Indira should tell us whether she wants to keep us in Hindostan or not. We like to live together, we like to live in India."<ref>Sandhu (1999), pLVI.</ref> To which he added, "if the Indian Government invaded the Darbar Sahib complex, the foundation for an independent Sikh state will have been laid."<ref>Sandhu (1999), pLVII.</ref> The BBC reported that he was daring law enforcement to react to his actions of fortifying the Golden Temple in order to bolster support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6570000/newsid_6572600/6572653.stm?bw=bb&mp=rm&news=1&bbcws=1 |title=Player - 1984: Troops raid Golden Temple |publisher=BBC News |date=1984-06-06 |accessdate=2009-08-09}}</ref>

==Role in the militancy==
On April 13, 1978, a few [[Amritdhari]] Sikhs of [[Akhand Kirtani Jatha]] went to protest against [[Nirankari]]s.  The confrontation led to the murder of thirteen members of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha and three members of the Nirankaris. The victims were implicated. This infuriated many Sikhs further. On April 24, 1980, the leader of [[Sant Nirankari Mission|Nirankaris]], Baba [[Gurbachan Singh]] Nirankari, was assassinated. The [[First Information Report|FIR]] named nearly twenty people involved in the murder, most of whom had ties to Bhindranwale.<ref name="SikhCoalition">{{cite web|title= Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale - Life, Mission, and Martyrdom|publisher=Sikh Educational and Religious Foundation|last=Sandhu|first=Ranbir S.|
date=1997-05|url=http://sikhcoalition.org/SantJarnailSingh.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref> Bhindranwale was subsequently implicated in ordering the assassination. A member of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Ranjit Singh, surrendered to committing the assassination three years later, and was sentenced to serve thirteen years at the [[Tihar Jail]]. Bhindranwale was later released due to absence of evidence.

On September 9, 1981, [[Lala Jagat Narain|Jagat Narain]], the proprietor of the Hind Samachar Group, was shot dead near the Amaltas Motel.<ref name="IT"/> Jagat Narain was a prominent opponent of Bhindranwale. He was present during the clash that occurred between Nirankaris and Akhand Kirtni Jatha Members, and stood witness at the Karnal Trial, in favour of the accused.<ref>{{cite book

==Sanctuary in the Golden Temple==

In 1982, Bhindranwale took shelter with a large group of his armed followers, in the Guru Nanak Niwas (Guest house), in the precincts of the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]].<ref name="IT"/> On December 15, 1983, Bhindranwale, forced out of Guru Nanak Niwas by Longowal,  then moved into the temple compound itself. He fortified the temple with light machine-guns
and sophisticated self-loading rifles were brought in.<ref name="SikhCoalition"/> Mark Tully and Satish Jacob wrote, "All terrorists were known by name to the shopkeepers and the householders who live in the narrow alleys surrounding the Golden Temple. ...The Punjab police must have known who they were also, but they made no attempt to arrest them. By this time Bhindranwale and his men were above the law."<ref>Tully and Jacob, p94.</ref>

==Death==
On June 3, 1984 Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] initiated [[Operation Blue Star]] and ordered the [[Indian Army]] to surround the Golden Temple complex to remove armed militants from the complex. Bhindranwale reportedly did not survive the operation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Brar |first=K.

According to [[Lieutenant General]] [[Kuldip Singh Brar]], who commanded the operation, the body of Bhindranwale was identified by a number of agencies, including the police, the Intelligence Bureau and militants in the Army's custody.<ref>{{cite book | last=Brar |first=K.

BBC correspondent [[Mark Tully]] also reported seeing Bhindranwale's body during his funeral.

[[Vir Sanghvi]], one of India's leading political commentators said, "[Bhindranwale] remains a [[martyr]] in the eyes of many Sikhs.
