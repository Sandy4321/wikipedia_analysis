'''Geoffrey I of Villehardouin''' ({{lang-fr|Geoffroi Ier de Villehardouin}}) (''c.'' 1169-''c.'' 1229) was a [[French people|French]] [[knight]] from the [[County of Champagne]] who joined the [[Fourth Crusade]].<ref>Runciman 1951, p. 126.</ref><ref name='Evergates 246'>Evergates 2007, p. 246.</ref><ref name='Setton 24'>Setton 1976, p. 24.</ref><ref name='Longnon 242'>Longnon 1969, p. 242.</ref> He participated in the conquest of the [[Peloponnese]] and became the second [[prince of Achaea]] (1209/1210-''c.'' 1229).<ref name='Evergates 246'/> 

Under his reign, the [[principality of Achaea]] became the direct vassal of the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]].<ref name='Longnon 239'>Longnon 1969, p. 239.</ref> He extended the borders of his principality, but the closing years of his rule were marked by his conflict with the church.<ref>Longnon 1969, pp. 240-241.</ref>

== Early years and the Fourth Crusade ==

Geoffrey was the eldest son of John of Villeharouin and his wife, Celine of Briel.<ref name='Evergates 246'/><ref name='Cawley'>{{cite web|url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/LATIN%20LORDSHIPS%20IN%20GREECE.htm#_Toc219779590|publisher= fmg.ac (Foundation for Medieval Genealogy)|title=Greece, Latin Lordships <U+2013> Chapter 1: Achaia <U+2013> B.: Princes of Achaia 1209-1278 (Villehardouin)|work=Medieval Lands|date=2010-07-03|author=Cawley, Charles|accessdate=2010-11-27}}</ref> He married Elisabeth of Chappes.<ref name='Cawley'/><ref>Evergates 2007, p. 263.</ref>

He took the cross with his uncle, [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin]], the future chronicler of the Fourth Crusade, at a tournament of <U+00C9>cry-sur-Aisne in late November 1199.<ref name='Setton 24'/> Geoffrey were among the crusaders who went directly to [[Syria]].<ref name='Setton 24'/> Thus he was not present at [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|the occupation of Constantinople by the crusaders on April 13, 1204]].<ref>Setton 1976, pp. 12., 24.</ref>

But hearing of the capture of the great city on the [[Bosporus]], he decided to sail west in the summer of 1204.<ref name='Setton 24'/><ref name='Fine 69'>Fine 1994, p. 69.</ref> But the weather became bad, and adverse winds drove him westward.<ref name='Setton 24'/> He landed at [[Methoni, Messenia|Modon]] (now Methoni, [[Greece]]) in the southern Peloponnese where he spent the winter of 1204-1205.<ref name='Setton 24'/><ref name='Fine 69'/>

== Conquest of the Peloponnese ==
[[Image:Peloponnese Middle Ages map-en.svg|thumb|left|250px|The Peloponnese in the Middle Ages]]
At Modon, Geoffrey entered into an alliance with a [[Greeks|Greek]] archon (nobleman) from [[Messenia]] to conquer as much of the western Peloponnese as they could.<ref name='Setton 24'/><ref name='Fine 69'/> Almost immediately afterward, however, the Greek died, and his son broke of the alliance.<ref name='Fine 69'/> It was at this point that Geoffrey learned of the appearance of King [[Boniface I, Marquess of Montferrat|Boniface I of Thessalonica]] (1204-1207) with his army before [[Nauplia]] (now Nafplion, Greece).<ref name='Setton 24'/> He determined to seek aid and rode up early in 1205 to join the king.<ref name='Setton 24'/><ref name='Fine 69'/> He was well received by Boniface I who would have retained Geoffrey in his service.<ref name='Setton 24'/> But in the camp at Nauplia Geoffrey found his good friend [[William of Champlitte]] and offered to the latter to share the conquest of the Peloponnese.<ref name='Setton 24'/><ref name='Longnon 237'>Longnon 1969, p. 237.</ref> His friend accepted the offer and the two also received royal permission for their expedition.<ref name='Setton 24'/>

They set out with 100 knights and 400 mounted men-at-arms upon their campaign in the spring of 1205.<ref name='Setton 25'>Setton 1976, p. 25.</ref> They took [[Patras]] and Pondikos by assault, and [[Andravida]] opened its gates.<ref name='Longnon 237'/> The people of the countryside came to make their submission and were confirmed in their property and local customs.<ref name='Longnon 237'/> Only in [[Arcadia]] were the crusaders resisted.<ref name='Fine 69'/> This opposition was led by landlords from Arcadia and [[Laconia]], particularly the Chamaretos family, allied to the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[Melingoi]] tribe.<ref>Fine 1994, pp. 69-70.</ref> The resistance was soon joined by a certain Michael identified by most scholars with [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas]] (1204-1215) who was then creating his own [[Despotate of Epirus|principality in Epiros]].<ref>Fine 1994, pp. 70., 614.</ref> Michael advanced into the Peloponnese with 5,000 men, but [[Battle of the Olive Grove of Koundouros|the little crusader army defeated him at Koundouros]] in northeast Messenia.<ref name='Longnon 237'/><ref name='Fine 70'>Fine 1994, p. 70.</ref> Then the crusaders completed the conquest of the region and advanced into the interior of the country, occupying the entire peninsula with the exception of Arcadia and Laconia.<ref name='Longnon 237'/>

William of Champlitte thus became master of the Peloponnese with the title prince of Achaea (1205-1209) under the suzerainty of the king of Thessalonica.<ref name='Longnon 237'/><ref name='Fine 70'/> Geoffrey received [[Kalamata]] and Messenia as a fief from the new prince.<ref name='Fine 70'/> However, the [[Republic of Venice]] proceeded to make good [[Latin Empire#History#Creation of the Latin Empire|her claims that the leaders of the Fourth Crusade had guaranteed it by the partition treaty of 1204]] to the important way stations along the sea route to Constantinople.<ref name='Longnon 238'>Longnon 1969, p. 238.</ref><ref name='Fine 71'>Fine 1994, p. 71.</ref> Thus the Venetians armed a fleet which took Modon and [[Koroni|Coron]] (now Koroni, Greece) in 1206.<ref name='Longnon 238'/><ref name='Fine 71'/> But William of Champlitte compensated Geoffrey by assigning Arcadia to him.<ref name='Fine 71'/>

== His reign in Achaea ==

In 1208 William I of Achaea departed for [[France]] in order to claim an inheritance his brother had left to him.<ref name='Longnon 239'/><ref>Setton 1976, p. 33.</ref> William I appointed Geoffrey to administer the principality as [[bailiff]] until the prince<U+2019>s nephew, Hugh should arrive.<ref name='Fine 71'/> However, both the first prince of Achaea and his nephew died very shortly.<ref>Setton 1976, pp. 33-34.</ref>

In May 1209, Geoffrey went to the parliament that the Latin Emperor [[Henry of Flanders|Henry I]] (1206-1216) had convoked at Ravennika to assure the emperor of his loyalty.<ref name='Longnon 239'/><ref>Fine 1994, p. 614.</ref> The emperor confirmed Geoffrey as prince of Achaea and made him immediate imperial vassal.<ref name='Longnon 239'/> Moreover, Henry I also appointed Geoffrey [[seneschal]] of the Latin Empire.<ref name='Setton 34'>Setton 1976, p. 34.</ref>

The ''[[Chronicle of the Morea]]'' narrates that Geoffrey only became prince of Achaea some time later, because the late William I<U+2019>s nephew, Robert had a year and a day to travel to the Peloponnese and claim his inheritance.<ref>Fine 1994, pp. 71-72.</ref> According to the story, all sorts of ruses were used to cause delays in Robert<U+2019>s trip east, and when he finally arrived in the Peloponnese Geoffrey kept moving from place to place with the leading knights until the time had elapsed.<ref name='Fine 72'>Fine 1994, p. 72.</ref> Geoffrey then held an assembly that declared that the heir had forfeited his rights and elected Geoffrey hereditary prince of Achaea.<ref name='Fine 72'/>

Nevertheless, Geoffrey I made a pact with the Venetians already in June 1209 on the island of [[Sapientza]].<ref name='Longnon 239'/> He acknowledged himself to be the vassal of the Republic of Venice for all the lands extending from [[Corinth]] to the roadstead of [[Pylos|Navarino]] (now Pylos, Greece).<ref name='Longnon 239'/><ref name='Setton 34'/> Geoffrey I also gave Venice the right to free trade throughout his principality.<ref name='Fine 71'/> According to the treaty, he and his successors were also to receive Venetian citizenship, own a house in [[Venice]], and present the Republic with three silk broadcloths a year, one for the [[Doge of Venice|doge]] and two for [[St Mark's Basilica]].<ref name='Setton 34'/>
[[Image:Larissa2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The medieval castle on Larissa Hill in Argos]]
Afterward Geoffrey I devoted himself to enlarging his possessions.<ref name='Longnon 240'>Longnon 1969, p. 240.</ref> With the aid of [[Otto de la Roche|Otto I]], the [[Duchy of Athens|lord of Athens]] (1204-1225), he seized, in 1209, the fortresses of [[Acrocorinth]] where first [[Leo Sgouros]], and then [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]], brother of Michael I of Epirus had resisted the attacks of the crusaders.<ref name='Longnon 240'/><ref>Fine 1994, p. 614.</ref> In 1210 he also achieved the surrender of Corinth, the other fortress held by the Greeks.<ref name='Setton 36'>Setton 1976, p. 36.</ref> In the month that followed, Nauplia was also taken, and early in 1212 the stronghold of [[Argos]], where Theodore Komnenos Doukas had stored the treasure of the Church of Corinth, likewise fell into the hands of Geoffrey I and Otto I.<ref name='Setton 36'/> When Albertino and Rolandino of Canossa, the lords of Thebes had left their town, the lordship of Thebes was divided equally between Geoffrey I and the lord of Athens.<ref name='Longnon 241'>Longnon 1969, p. 241.</ref>

Geoffrey I sent to France, mainly to Champagne, for young knights to occupy the newly conquered lands and the fiefs of those who had returned to the west.<ref name='Longnon 240'/> Under Geoffrey I the assignment of [[fief]]s and the obligations which went with them were reviewed before the barons assembled in a great parliament at Andravida.<ref>Setton 1976, p. 30.</ref> Thus a dozen or so great baronies came into being in the principality, and those who received the titles to them made up with their many vassals the High Court of Achaea.<ref>Setton 1976, p. 31.</ref> 

At the time of the conquest much ecclesiastical property had been secularized and, despite the demands of the clergy, this had not been returned to the churches.<ref name='Longnon 241'/> The ''Chronicle of the Morea'' reports that when the churches refused to provide their fair share of military aid, Geoffrey I seized their property and devoted the income from it to the construction of the powerful castle of Clermont.<ref name='Longnon 241'/> Furthermore, Geoffrey I was also accused of treating the Greek priests as serfs because their numbers had considerably increased, since the Greek prelates showed no hesitation in conferring orders on peasants to permit them to escape the burdens of serfdom.<ref name='Longnon 241'/> These events resulted in a prolonged conflict with the church.<ref name='Longnon 241'/>

First the [[Latin Patriarch of Constantinople]], Gervasius promulgated a decree of [[excommunication]] against Geoffrey I and laid an [[interdict]] upon Achaea.<ref name='Setton 46'>Setton 1976, p. 46.</ref> Upon the request of Geoffrey I, however, on February 11, 1217 [[Pope Honorius III]] (1216-1227) declared that the patriarch was to relax the sentence within a week after the receipt of the papal letter.<ref name='Setton 46'/> Then the patriarch sent out a legate who laid a new interdict upon the Principality of Achaea.<ref name='Setton 47'>Setton 1976, p. 47.</ref> But his act was again qualified by the pope as usurpation of the power of the [[Holy See]].<ref name='Setton 47'/> 

Next the [[papal legate]] Cardinal Giovanni Colonna who was travelling through the Peloponnese in 1218 excommunicated Geoffroy I because of the prince's contumacious retention of certain abbeys, churches, rural parishes, and ecclesiastical goods.<ref>Setton 1976, pp. 47-48.</ref> Upon the request of the local high clergy, the pope confirmed Geoffrey I's excommunication on January 21, 1219.<ref name='Setton 47'/> The pope even declared Geoffrey I to be an enemy of God <U+201C>more inhuman than Pharaoh<U+201D>.<ref name='Longnon 241'/>

The conflict lasted some five years, until 1223 when Geoffrey I decided to negotiate and sent one of his knights to [[Rome]].<ref name='Longnon 241'/> Finally on September 4, 1223 Pope Honorius III confirmed the accord that had been drawn up between the prince and the church of Achaea.<ref name='Longnon 241'/> According to the treaty, Geoffrey I restored the church lands, but he kept the treasures and furnishings of the churches in exchange for an annual indemnity and the number of Greek priests enjoying liberty and immunity was also to be limited in proportion to the size of the community.<ref name='Longnon 241'/>

In the meantime, Theodore I of Epirus (1215-1224) had attacked the kingdom of Thessalonica and laid siege the kingdom's capital.<ref name='Longnon 242'/> William I, despite the urgent appeals of the pope, did not appear to have assisted the threatened city that finally surrendered near the end of 1224.<ref name='Longnon 242'/><ref>Setton 1976, p. 51.</ref>

Geoffrey died sometime between 1228 and 1230 at the age of about sixty.<ref name='Longnon 242'/> He was buried in the Church of St James in Andravida.<ref name='Cawley'/>
