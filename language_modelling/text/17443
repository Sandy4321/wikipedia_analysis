The '''Mutual Defense Treaty Between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America''' was signed on August 30, 1951 in [[Washington, D.C.]] between representatives of the [[Philippines]] and the [[United States]]. The overall accord contained eight articles and dictated that both nations would support each other if either the Philippines or the United States were to be attacked by an external party.

==Brief History==

[[Image:George Dewey at the National Portrait Gallery IMG 4432.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Admiral Dewey as he appears at the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]     

After Admiral George Dewey's defeat of the Spanish fleet at the [[Battle of Manila Bay]] in May 1898, the U.S. occupied the [[Philippines]]. In the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris]] which officially ended the [[Spanish-American War]] Spain ceded official control of the islands to the United States. A [[Philippine revolution|war of revolution]] which had been waged during the final decades of [[History of the Philippines (1521&ndash;1898)|Spanish rule in the Philippines]] was reignited after the transition of power from Spain to the United States as the [[Philippine&ndash;American War]].{{#tag:ref|The conflict was long referred to as the "Philippine insurrection" by  many U.S. Historians. Filipinos and, increasingly,  American historians now refer to these hostilities as the [[Philippine-American War]] (1899-1902). In 1999, the U.S. Library of Congress reclassified its references to use this term.{{citation needed|date=April 2012|reason=I've seen a supporting source, but couldn't locate it again}}|group=note}} The resistance to U.S. Rule led by revolutionary General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. During this war, fighting and disease claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Filipinos and thousands of Americans. After Aguinaldo was captured in 1901 and swore allegiance to the United States, resistance gradually died out until the conflict officially ended with a unilateral peace proclamation by the U.S. on July 4, 1902. Armed resistance continued sporadically until 1913, however, especially among the Muslims in Mindanao and Sulu.<ref name="U.S. Department of State"/>

Five years after the end of the resistance movement and the peace proclamation of 1902 the first bicameral legislative body was elected in 1907. Coinciding with the establishment of the legislature, a civil service was formed under the guidance of the U.S. and was gradually taken over by the Filipinos. By the end of the first world war the Filipinos had rightly established control over their own civil services. Shortly thereafter the Catholic Church was largely disestablished and a considerable amount of church land was purchased and redistributed.<ref name="U.S. Department of State"/>

The U.S. passed the [[Tydings-McDuffie Act]] on March 24, 1934, during the interwar years in the midst of the [[Great Depression]] .<ref name="Philippine History Organization"/> In 1935, under the terms of that act, the Philippines became a self-governing commonwealth. [[Manuel Quezon]] was the first elected president of the new commonwealth. Under Quezon's administration, the new Philippine commonwealth was tasked with preparing their country for eventual independence from the United States after a 10 year transition period. However, the [[Empire of Japan]] attacked the Philippines in December 1941 bringing World War II to the Philippines.<ref name="U.S. Department of State"/>

In May 1942 the remaining U.S. and Filipino forces on [[Corregidor]] surrendered to the Japanese and with it, the Philippines. U.S. forces under the command of [[General Douglas MacArthur]] landed on the island of Leyte on October 20, 1944 to retake the islands. During the war, Filipinos and Americans fought side by side to retake the islands. The fighting continued until the Japanese surrender in August 1945.<ref name="U.S. Department of State"/>

As a result of the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese invasion and occupation]] and the battles of liberation, climaxing in the 1945 [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]], the Philippines suffered tremendous damage which resulted in a complete organizational breakdown of government and civil services. In total, an estimated one million Filipinos lost their lives resisting the Japanese. Despite the shaken state of the country, the United States and the Philippines decided to continue with their initial plans for independence as stipulated in 1934 in accordance with the terms of the [[Tydings-McDuffie Act]]. On July 4, 1946, the Commonwealth of the Philippine Islands officially became the Republic of the Philippines.<ref name="U.S. Department of State"/>

In the aftermath of World War II, the [[Cold War]] erupted. From 1945-1949 the [[Soviet Union]] was solidifying itself as a global superpower opposed to the United States and China was thrust back into its civil war. The Chinese civil war ultimately lead to the conquest of [[Mao Tse Tung]] and [[Red China]] after the defeat of the Chinese Nationalist under [[Chiang Kai-shek]].<ref name="Hoover Institute at Standford University"/> In addition, the Korean war was waging for control of the Korean peninsula between the U.S. led United Nations forces and the Communist forces of [[North Korea]] and [[Red China]].<ref name="BBC"/>  As a response to the growing threat of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Red China]] mutual defense treaties were drafted and ratified between the United States and several key Asian allies in efforts to contain the growing communist threat of the 1950s.<ref name="Congressional Research Services"/>

After the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] and the decline of the threat of communism in the 1990s bilateral support for the mutual defense treaty has taken a roller coaster ride especially in the [[Philippines]]. Generally, the Philippine Government has remained favorable towards the treaty ever since its inception, more often coming to rely on the U.S. for its defenses as it has done ever since World War II. This was nonetheless more apparent during the [[Cold War]] given the numerous active U.S. Military bases in the Philippines. The most notable and controversial of these bases are [[Clark Air Force Base]] outside of metro[[Manila]], and the U.S. Naval Station [[Subic Bay]]. The bases were garrisoned for nearly 40 years after the end of [[World War II]] until the early 1990s. In 1991 anti-US sentiment in the Philippines forced the Philippine Senate to reject a new base agreement treaty that subsequently forced the removal of all US forces from Philippine soil.<ref name="New York Times"/> However, given the rise of global terrorism with the events of [[9/11]] and the subsequent economic rise and militant expansion of China,  the United States has strengthened its ties to its Asian allies especially the [[Philippines]].<ref name="Congressional Research Services"/>
 
Recently, both the [[U.S.]] and the [[Philippines]] boast ongoing support for the bilateral treaty. In the wake of continual unsettling international events in the [[South China Sea]] involving the increasingly aggressive approaches by China towards the [[Philippines]] over a territorial dispute in the resource laden [[Spratly Islands]],<ref name="Fox News Corporation"/> U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] visited the [[Philippines]] in November 2011 to reaffirm their countries ties to one another. On November 16, 2011 the 60th Anniversary of the signing if the U.S.-Philippine Mutual Defense Treaty Secretary Clinton addressed the defense concerns of the Filipino people on the deck of the guided missile destroyer [[USS Fitzgerald]].<ref name="Fox News Corporation"/> The Fitzgerald was docked in [[Manila Bay]] during such time Secretary Clinton signed the Manila Declaration along side her Filipino counterpart Foreign Secretary Alberto Del Rosario.<ref name="Fox News Corporation"/>

The Manila Declaration was a formal affirmation of defensive ties between the two countries that date back over a century. The declaration states that "The Republic of the Philippines and the United States reaffirm our shared obligations under the Mutual Defense Treaty. We expect to maintain a robust, balanced, and responsive security partnership including cooperating to enhance the defense, interdiction, and apprehension capabilities of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America today commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Philippines-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty. On this historic occasion, we reflect on the rich history of our alliance and the continuing relevance of the treaty for peace, security, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. We also reaffirm the treaty as the foundation of our relationship for the next 60 years and beyond.

The United States and the Philippines are bound by a deep and abiding friendship forged by a history of shared sacrifice and common purpose. The many Filipinos who bravely served side-by-side with American servicemen and women during World War II and the veterans of our two nations buried at the Manila American Cemetery in Fort Bonifacio bear testament to our profound and enduring bonds. These bonds are enriched by the presence in the US of over four million Filipinos and Filipino Americans, and in the Philippines by over 150,000 Americans, who help shape the political and economic future of both countries".<ref name="US Department of State"/>

In a followup to the signing of the Manila Declaration the U.S. and Philippine representatives met to sign onto a new partnership strengthening the economic and defensive ties of the two countries. This new formal agreement is  the Partnership for Growth. This new agreement comes as a part of President Obama's Global development initiative which is designed to strengthen the [[Philippines]] business development and commercial ties between the two countries.<ref name="Initiative For Global Development"/> During the signing ceremony of this new agreement Secretary Clinton reaffirmed the U.S.'s position on the mutual defense of the Philippines through the statement "The US will always be in the corner of the Philippines. We will always stand and fight with you to achieve the future we seek".<ref name="Inquirer Global Nation"/>  

Official support for the treaty appears to be growing in the face of foreign threats and fears especially as they pertain to China. Under the Aquino Administration in the Philippines and the Obama Administration in the United States neither country appears to be giving any indication of weakening its economic or military ties to one another.

==Opposition Movement==

[[File:Evacuees from Mount Pinatubo board the USS Abraham Lincoln.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Evacuees board the [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'']]]]
Opposition to the U.S.-Philippine Mutual Defense Treaty has had its periods of escalations and mediocrity on both sides of the Pacific. The fiercest opposition to the treaty has been the most notable in the Philippines over the past 25 years. Given the longevity of the U.S. Military presence in the Philippines opposition to the U.S. Military presence in the Philippines and the treaty itself began in the 1980s with the escalating tensions surrounding U.S. policy decisions and their repercussions.<ref name="Anti-Americanism Comparative Perspectives"/> The late 1970s and 1980s saw a rise in anti-us sentiment following the increasing allegations and perpetration's of U.S. military personnel misconduct towards Filipino men and women. The nightclubs and social hotspots surrounding [[Clark Air Force Base]] and [[Naval Base Subic Bay]] became flashpoints of allegations of assaults by U.S. service-members on the local Filipinos.<ref name="Anti-Americanism Comparative Perspectives"/>
Political tensions steadily grew. In 1991 the Military Bases Agreement of 1947 were expiring and the [[George H.W. Bush]] Administration of the U.S. and the Benoit Aquino II Administration of the Philippines were in talks to renew the agreement. A new treaty was drafted and the new "Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation" specified the renewal of the leases.<ref name="University of California at Berkley"/> Anti-US sentiment continued to grow in the [[Philippines]] and it was reflected in the election of the Philippine Senate. The majority of the Philippine Senate were in opposition to Philippine President Aquino's Administrations treaty. On September 13, 1991 the Philippine Senate voted and refused to ratify it. As a result, the last of the U.S. military personnel in the [[Philippines]] were removed from on November 24, 1992.<ref name="New York Times"/>
[[File:US Flag lowered and Philippine flag raised during turnover of NS Subic Bay.jpg|thumb|The American Flag is lowered and Philippine flag is raised during turnover of Naval Station Subic Bay.]]
The opposition movement within the Philippines subsided after the removal of U.S. personnel from the Philippines in the early 90's. It never truly dissipated in its entirety however. Anti-US sentiment remained a prevalent social issue within the collegiate community in metro Manila and relatively small anti-US demonstrations routinely took place outside the U.S. Embassy until the early 2000s.<ref name="Congressional Research Service"/> As a result of the unfortunate events surrounding [[9/11]] the U.S. began restructuring and exercising its rights of the U.S. Philippine Defense Treaty as a part of its [[War on Terrorism]].<ref name="Congressional Research Service"/> As the U.S. Military and Philippine Armed Forces began training and conducting anti-terrorist missions within the Philippine archipelago anti-US sentiment began to slowly rise. Opposition has risen to its current levels as a result of seemingly ignorance on the part of the U.S. towards the Philippine's plight involving the [[Spratly Islands dispute]].<ref name="Inquirer-Global Nation"/> Fairly large recent protests have taken place in the streets of Manila showing their resentment of the defense treaty and its implications. Some of these protests went as far as harassing U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton during her latest visit to the Philippines to celebrate the treaty's 60th anniversary.<ref name="Inquirer-Global Nation"/> Protestors marked their displeasure with the treaty by throwing obstacles such as rocks and red paint at Secretary Clinton's convoy causing a very brief security altercation between Secret Service Agents and protestors.<ref name="Inquirer-Global Nation"/> Although protests have remained relatively peaceful up to this point opposition to the treaty shows no signs of quelling and only smaller signs of strengthening. The majority of the Philippine politicians remain on the fence about the issue however the Aquino Administration remains heavily in favor of the treaty as did his mother's administration.<ref name="Inquirer-Global Nation"/>
