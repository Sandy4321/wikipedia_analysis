{{nihongo|'''Kakashi Hatake'''|<U+306F><U+305F><U+3051><U+3000><U+30AB><U+30AB><U+30B7>|Hatake Kakashi}} is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] in the ''[[Naruto]]'' [[manga]] and [[anime]] series created by [[Masashi Kishimoto]]. Kishimoto originally planned to introduce Kakashi in the manga to the series' titular character, [[Naruto Uzumaki]], early on, but pushed back this meeting so that Naruto's teammates could be better developed.<ref name="FailedCh2">{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 1|year=2003|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-56931-900-6|page=128}}</ref>

In the story, Kakashi is the leader and teacher of Team 7, consisting of the series' primary characters, [[Sasuke Uchiha]], [[Sakura Haruno]], and [[Naruto Uzumaki]]. He is initially portrayed as a detached and [[apathetic]] figure, but as the series progresses, his loyalty to his friends and students becomes increasingly apparent. Kakashi's past has been extensively explored in the series, resulting in a ''[[gaiden]]'' being devoted to his past experiences. Kakashi has appeared in several pieces of ''Naruto'' media, including three of the four featured films in the series, all of the original video animations, and several video games.

Numerous anime and manga publications have praised and criticized Kakashi's character. Although he has been noted to be an echo of similar detached ''[[sh<U+014D>nen manga]]'' characters, the [[dualism|duality]] of Kakashi's apathetic and serious sides have been praised.<ref name="IGNNarutoReader">{{cite web|url=http://anime.ign.com/articles/834/834323p4.html|title=IGN: Naruto Reader's Guide|publisher=IGN|author=Sparrow, A.E.|date=October 9, 2007|accessdate=February 8, 2008}}</ref><ref name="THEMAnimeReview">{{cite web|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=120|title=THEM Anime Reviews 4.0 - Naruto|publisher=T.H.E.M.

==Creation and conception==
Masashi Kishimoto originally intended for Kakashi to debut in the second chapter of the ''Naruto'' manga, appearing prior to the other members of [[List of Naruto characters#Team 7|Team 7]]. This Kakashi was designed as a laid back, affected, skilled [[ninja]] that ended his sentences with the polite "''de gozaru''" in the Japanese versions of the series. After speaking with his editor, Kishimoto pushed this debut back, allowing him to better develop Kakashi and the rest of Team 7.<ref name="FailedCh2"/> Despite this, Kakashi retains many of his original personality traits, being easygoing, unfazed by the actions of others, and appearing to be half-asleep. Kishimoto feels that this makes Kakashi a compelling leader and helps to keep the diverse members of Team 7 unified.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-1407-9|page=141}}</ref> Because he acts as a link between the other main characters of the series, Kakashi is rarely featured prominently in promotional artwork, instead appearing in the background while his students are the focus of the scene.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-1407-9|page=121}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-1407-9|page=124}}</ref> In an interview in [[Weekly Sh<U+014D>nen Jump|''Sh<U+014D>nen Jump'']]'s, Kishimoto said that if he were to make an extra story from the manga with a different character, such character would be Kakashi.<ref name="AnimeProfiles">{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi |title=Naruto Anime Profiles, Volume 1: Episodes 1-37|year=2006|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|pages=|isbn=1421506572}}</ref>

When deciding upon Kakashi's name, Kishimoto considered a number of possibilities: Kuwa (<U+30AF><U+30EF>, "[[hoe]]"), Kama (<U+30AB><U+30DE>, "[[scythe]]"), Botan (<U+30DC><U+30BF><U+30F3>, "[[peony]]"), Enoki (<U+30A8><U+30CE><U+30AD>, a nettle tree), and Kakashi (<U+30AB><U+30AB><U+30B7>, "[[scarecrow]]"). He eventually decided upon Kakashi, and remains glad that he did to this day.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 2|year=2003|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-59116-178-9|page=126}}</ref> In keeping with the meaning of his name, scarecrows are occasionally used to represent Kakashi; Naruto, for example, uses a scarecrow that is dressed like Kakashi to help him train for a combat test between the two.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 1|year=2003|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 4|isbn=1-56931-900-6|page=121}}</ref> Likewise, scarecrows are at times added to the background of scenes in which Kakashi appears, as is the case with the cover of the ''Naruto'' manga volume three.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-1407-9|page=129}}</ref>

==Character outline==
===Background===
Kakashi's background goes unexplored for the first part of the series, not being shown in any detail until ''Kakashi Gaiden'', a six chapter series that divides the gap between Part I and II of the manga. During Kakashi's youth, his father, a ninja who was highly revered in [[World of Naruto#Konohagakure|Konohagakure]], abandoned a mission crucial to the village in order to save the lives of his teammates. Disgraced by the villagers and those he had saved because of the repercussions the village suffered, Kakashi's father committed suicide. Wishing to avoid his father's dishonor, Kakashi adopted the philosophy that the success of a mission must always come first, becoming humorless and by-the-book in the process.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 27|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 240|pages=103<U+2013>105|isbn=1-4215-1863-5}}</ref>

In later years Kakashi was assigned by his teacher, [[List of Naruto characters#Minato Namikaze|Minato Namikaze]], to lead a mission that would turn the current war in Konoha's favor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 27|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 239|pages=78<U+2013>79|isbn=1-4215-1863-5}}</ref> When his teammate, Rin, was captured by enemy ninja, Kakashi elected to leave her behind and finish the mission. His other teammate, Obito Uchiha, rejected this alternative, stating that those who abandon their mission are trash but those who abandon their teammates are worse than trash and that Kakashi's father had done the right thing by saving his teammates.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 27|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 241|isbn=1-4215-1863-5}}</ref> Touched by Obito's words, Kakashi joined him in a rescue effort, though his left eye became damaged in the ensuing battle.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 27|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 242|isbn=1-4215-1863-5|page=140}}</ref> After finding Rin and preparing to escape, an enemy-induced cave-in crushed Obito's right half. With his dying wish and the possibility of enemy reinforcements, Obito urged his teammates to leave and finish the mission. Before leaving, Obito had Rin implant his newly acquired [[Jutsu (Naruto)#Sharingan|Sharingan]] into Kakashi's damaged eye socket as a gift.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 27|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 243|isbn=1-4215-1863-5}}</ref> His new eye in place, Kakashi fled with Rin as the cave collapsed, eventually completing their mission and forever mourning Obito's death.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 27|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 244|pages=184<U+2013>185|isbn=1-4215-1863-5}}</ref>

===Personality===
Obito's death greatly changed Kakashi, as he adopted many of Obito's traits and philosophies. Most recurring of these is his concept of teamwork: when first forming Team 7, Kakashi gauges their abilities with a bell test in which the three must capture the two bells he keeps on his person. Only by working as a team, regardless of the fact that there aren't enough bells for each of them, are Naruto, Sakura, and Sasuke able to pass, instilling in them the concept of teamwork early on.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 2|year=2003|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 8|pages=20<U+2013>25|isbn=1-59116-178-9}}</ref> Kakashi continues to further this philosophy for the duration of [[List of Naruto chapters (Part I)|Part I]] upon [[Sasuke Uchiha]], whose drive to get stronger causes him to slowly turn against his friends and teammates. Though Kakashi frequently reminds Sasuke of the importance of teamwork and tries to show him how strength can be found in friendship, he is unable to get through to him before the latter's defection from Konoha.<ref name="c177">{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 20|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 177|pages=109<U+2013>114|isbn=1-4215-1655-1}}</ref>

Kakashi keeps his personal life separate from his interactions with his students, only going so far as to say that he has a number of hobbies and dreams that are "none of [their] business".<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 1|year=2003|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 4|isbn=1-56931-900-6|page=113}}</ref> He also states that everyone precious to him is dead.<ref name="c177"/> What is known of Kakashi's personal life is that he spends much of his free time at a memorial site where Obito's name is engraved. He tends to lose track of time when he is there, and is frequently late to his appointments as a result (another trait adopted from Obito).<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 16|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 139|isbn=1-4215-1090-1|page=80}}</ref> Similarly, Kakashi constantly keeps the lower half of his face covered, and thus the appearance of his face remains a mystery. [[List of Naruto episodes (seasons 3-4)#ep101|Episode 101]] of the anime, an [[omake]] episode dedicated to Team 7's efforts to unmask Kakashi, implies he is quite handsome, as two employees from the Ichiraku [[ramen]] shop (male and female) are left awestruck after he briefly removes his mask to eat (although a distraction prevents Team 7 and the viewer from seeing his face). In another omake included with the third ''Naruto'' databook, his own pack of dogs struggles with remembering what he looks like: each remembers him as having a completely different face and, after they finally agree about what he looks like, they realize that their description was entirely wrong.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|title=Naruto Character Official Data Book Hiden Sha no Sho|year=2008|publisher=Shueisha|isbn=978-4-08-874247-2|pages=352<U+2013>356}}</ref>

One pastime that Kakashi makes no attempt to hide from even his students is his fondness for the {{nihongo|''Make Out''|<U+30A4><U+30C1><U+30E3><U+30A4><U+30C1><U+30E3>|Icha Icha}} series of erotic novels. The books, detailing the author's ([[Jiraiya (Naruto)|Jiraiya]]) experiences in love, are runaway [[best-seller]]s within the ''Naruto'' world.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 11|year=2006|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 91|pages=9<U+2013>10|isbn=1-4215-0241-0}}</ref> When asked more specifically about the contents of the books, Masashi Kishimoto explained that ''Naruto'''s target demographic was not old enough for him to disclose the details of the plot.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 2|year=2003|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-59116-178-9|page=166}}</ref> Kakashi is usually seen reading one of the books during events that do not require his complete attention, such as his early conversations and training sessions with Team 7.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 1|year=2003|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 5|pages=132<U+2013>135|isbn=1-56931-900-6}}</ref> Naruto has on occasion used Kakashi's attachment to the books against him; he threatens to spoil the ending of the latest installment in the series, forcing Kakashi to shut his eyes and cover his ears to avoid learning the secret and leaving him off guard in the process.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 28|year=2008|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 246|pages=45<U+2013>47|isbn=1-4215-1864-3}}</ref>

===Abilities===
[[Image:KakashiMangekyoSharinganAnime.jpg|thumb|Kakashi's Mangekyo Sharingan.]]
The Sharingan given to him by Obito is a sticking point to Kakashi's fame in the ''Naruto'' world. Granting him the ability to [[mimic]] the movements and [[Jutsu (Naruto)|jutsu]] of others, the Sharingan gives him an edge in battle by allowing him to turn his opponent's abilities against them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 2|year=2003|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 12|isbn=1-59116-178-9|page=94}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 2|year=2003|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 15|isbn=1-59116-178-9}}</ref> This has allowed him to add over one thousand different attacks to his repertoire, leading to his nickname of {{nihongo|"Copy Ninja Kakashi"|<U+30B3><U+30D4><U+30FC><U+5FCD><U+8005><U+306E><U+30AB><U+30AB><U+30B7>|Kop<U+012B> Ninja no Kakashi}}.<ref name="Stats">{{cite book|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|title=Naruto Character Official Data Book Hiden Sha no Sho|year=2008|publisher=Shueisha|page=133|isbn=978-4-08-874247-2}}</ref> Because the Sharingan only naturally occurs in those of Uchiha lineage, and because his is always active, Kakashi depletes his energy quickly when using it and so must cover it with his headband during his daily activities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 16|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 142|isbn=1-4215-1652-7|page=143}}</ref> During the gap in time between Part I and [[List of Naruto chapters (Part II)|II]] of the series, Kakashi develops a [[Jutsu (Naruto)#Mangekyo Sharingan|Mangekyo Sharingan]] through unknown means. With it he can perform a jutsu called {{nihongo|Kamui|<U+795E><U+5A01>||literally "God's Authority"}}, which sends any targeted object to another dimension.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|title=Naruto Character Official Data Book Hiden Sha no Sho|year=2008|publisher=Shueisha|isbn=978-4-08-874247-2|pages=240<U+2013>241}}</ref> Because performing this ability requires extended bed rest afterwards, Kakashi avoids using it unless absolutely necessary.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 38|year=2007|publisher=Shueisha|chapter=Chapter 243|isbn=4-08-874364-6}}</ref>

[[Image:KakashiLightningBlade.jpg|thumb|Kakashi using Lightning Blade.]]
Although most of Kakashi's abilities were acquired with his Sharingan, he has two abilities he developed by himself. [[Jutsu (Naruto)#Chidori|Lightning Blade]], a collection of lightning [[Jutsu (Naruto)#Chakra|chakra]] in one's hand, was created by Kakashi in his youth. By rushing at the enemy and thrusting the Lightning Blade into his target, he can kill most opponents with one strike. He was not able to effectively utilize the Lightning Blade until gaining his Sharingan, as regular eyes experience a tunnel-vision effect when using it and thus leaving the user open to [[counterattacks]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 27|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 240|isbn=1-4215-1863-5}}</ref> In Part II he displays other lightning-based abilities, such as a clone that can act in his place and paralyze what it comes into contact with, but it is unclear if these are his own creations.

He has a second unique ability of being able to [[Jutsu (Naruto)#Summoning Technique|summon]] a pack of eight {{nihongo|ninja dogs|<U+5FCD><U+72AC>|Ninken}} to his side. The dogs are capable of talking and each one has a [[henohenomoheji]] on his back, a face used on [[scarecrow]]s. He primarily uses them for tracking purposes, sending them out to find and if necessary pin down a target until he arrives.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 4|year=2004|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 29|isbn=1-59116-358-7}}</ref> Because of his proficiency and well-roundedness with ninja abilities, Kakashi is noted to be an obvious candidate for the position of [[World of Naruto#Kage|Hokage]], the protector of Konoha, should the position ever become vacant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 40|year=2007|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 367|isbn=4-08-874432-2}}</ref>

==Plot overview==
Kakashi's role in the series predominately consists of his time with Team 7, leading them on missions and training them to improve their ninja abilities. He takes a special interest in Sasuke Uchiha during Part I, who he trains exclusively in an attempt to steer him away from [[Orochimaru (Naruto)|Orochimaru]], an enemy to Konoha. His efforts prove unsuccessful when Sasuke defects from Konoha at the end of Part I.<ref name="c177"/> Naruto and Sakura also part ways at this time, leaving Kakashi's tutelage to train under new teachers. Two-and-a-half years later in Part II, Kakashi reforms Team 7 with Naruto, Sakura, Sai, and Yamato.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 28|year=2008|publisher=Viz Media|chapter=Chapter 245|isbn=1-4215-1864-3|page=26}}</ref> He assists and leads the new Team 7 in their continued efforts to find and retrieve Sasuke, but with each attempt Sasuke has eluded them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 43|year=2008|publisher=Shueisha|chapter=Chapter 396|isbn=4-08-874552-7}}</ref> Because his students are now capable of taking care of themselves, Kakashi takes a more active role in the battles that go on during the series, particularly those with the criminal organization [[List of Naruto antagonists#Akatsuki|Akatsuki]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|title=Naruto, Volume 37|year=2007|publisher=Shueisha|chapter=Chapter 331|isbn=4-08-874338-7}}</ref> When the Akatsuki leader, [[List of Naruto antagonists#Pain|Pain]], invades Konoha, Kakashi engages him in battle but he is defeated and killed. However, after his confrontation with Naruto, Pain decides to use all of his remaining power to revive all those killed in the battle at Konoha, including Kakashi. He later finds and decides to engage Sasuke in battle having realized he has become a menace. <!-- Chapter 483 --> Following Madara Uchiha's declaration of war, he is been selected by the five kages to be a captain in the joint shinobi army created to combat the former.

Several publications for manga, anime, video games, and other related media have provided praise and criticism on Kakashi's character. [[IGN]] noted the duality of Kakashi's serious persona in combat and his laid back, apathetic countenance when dealing with his students, but accepted that he is one of the most popular characters in the series.<ref name="IGNNarutoReader"/> They also commented that Kakashi is one of the more popular characters they have seen [[cosplay]]ed at anime conventions.<ref name="IGNNarutoReader"/> Active Anime celebrated Kakashi's abilities, noting that he fell into the overall theme of characters hiding detailed personalities and secrets.<ref name="AnimeJumpReview">{{cite web|url=http://www.activeanime.com/pn/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=3414|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080728170141/http://www.activeanime.com/pn/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=3414|archivedate=2008-07-28|title=ActiveAnime.com :: NARUTO UNCUT BOX SET 1 (ADVANCE REVIEW)|publisher=Active Anime|date=July 3, 2006|accessdate=February 8, 2008}}</ref> T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews derided Kakashi as a stereotypical "Man of Mystery" seen in other ''sh<U+014D>nen'' manga, but praised him as being "much more interesting" than the three main characters, and felt that for all intents and purposes, the show could be renamed simply "Kakashi".<ref name="THEMAnimeReview"/> Mania Entertainment's Dani Moure likes how Kakashi fits into Team 7 due to the fact he is a "hilarious character in that sometimes he doesn't seem all that bothered about things and yet is so masterful of his craft."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/naruto-unleashed-set-11_article_78617.html|title=Naruto Unleashed Set 1.1|publisher=Mania Entertainment|author=Moure, Dani|date=September 1, 2006|accessdate=September 4, 2009}}</ref> Chris Beveridge from the site stated that Kakashi is his favorite character from the series because of his personality and praised his fight against Pain, and that after its ending, the character gets "a very humanizing moment", making the episode from the battle stand out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/naruto-shippuden-episode-159_article_122399.html|title=Naruto: Shippuden Episode #159|publisher=Mania Entertainment|author=Beveridge, Chris|date=May 6, 2010|accessdate=May 6, 2010}}</ref> Manga author [[Yoshihiro Togashi]] found Kakashi's first battle against his students as one of the first series' moments that impressed him due to how the difference in strength between such characters was shown by just making Kakashi read a book during the fight.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|authorlink=Masashi Kishimoto|title=NARUTO<U+2015><U+30CA><U+30EB><U+30C8><U+2015>[<U+79D8><U+4F1D><U+00B7><U+7686><U+306E><U+66F8>]<U+30AA><U+30D5><U+30A3><U+30B7><U+30E3><U+30EB><U+30D7><U+30EC><U+30DF><U+30A2><U+30E0><U+30D5><U+30A1><U+30F3>BOOK|series=Naruto|date=December 4, 2009|publisher=Shueisha|location=Japan|language=Japanese|isbn=978-4-08-874834-4|page=74<U+2013>81}}</ref>
