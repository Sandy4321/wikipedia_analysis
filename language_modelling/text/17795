'''Godstone''' is a village in the county of [[Surrey]], [[England]]. It is located approximately six miles east of [[Reigate]] at the junction of the [[A22 road|A22]] and [[A25 road|A25]] major roads, and near the [[M25 motorway]].

==History==
The village lay within the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] administrative division of [[Tandridge (hundred)|Tandridge]] [[hundred (division)|hundred]]. It is built along a stretch of the [[London to Brighton Way (Roman road)|London to Brighton Way]] Roman road, which comes through the Caterham Gap and continues southward along Tilburstow Hill Road.

Godstone initially had a different name. The village had been known as Walkingstead, meaning 'Wolcen's place', from the [[Old English language|Old English]] [[personal name]] Wolcen (related to modern English "[[:wikt:welkin|welkin]]" meaning [[cloud]]") and ''stede'' "place, homestead", related to modern [[English language|English]] stead. A record of the name from 932 as ''Wuulicinsted'' proves this. Another record, undated, shows the name as ''Wolinstede'', suggesting the same etymology. In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 it was ''Wachelstede''.<ref>[http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/g1ntw/ Norman Marshal]</ref>

The name of the village was recorded in 1248 as ''Godeston'', suggesting an etymology of the [[Old English language|Old English]] personal name [[Goda of England|Goda]] and tun "farm, village", here in the sense "village" rather than "estate" considering the village size. Thus the suggested etymology is "Goda's farm". [[Goda of England|Goda]] was the daughter of [[Aethelred The Unready]]. She died in 1055 but the [[Domesday book]] of 1086 records the parish as being held by her husband, Count [[Eustace II of Boulogne]].

However, earlier records have the name listed as ''Cudeston'' (1153) and ''Codstune'' (1173) suggesting "farmstead of a man called C<U+014D>d" (pronounced as "[[code]]", not "[[cod]]"), as with the [[Cotswolds]], high-forest land of a man called C<U+014D>d. However, if this etymology is proven, then it would almost certainly not be the same individual who gave his name to the [[Cotswolds]].

==Geography==
The heart of Godstone consists of two centres which are now conservation areas, Church Town and Godstone Green.<ref>Jaques, J (1992) : "Bygone Godstone", Phillimore</ref>

Church Town, with its old timber framed buildings, is quiet and secluded. The Old Packhouse, dating from the 15th century, is the oldest timber framed building in the town.  In the 18th Century, brick became the fashionable material for house building, and Church End and Church House, opposite the church, are two fine examples.

St Nicholas Church dominates Church Town. The North aisle was built in about 1845. Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]]'s [[Victorian restoration|restoration]] of the church in 1872-3 involved widening of the chancel arch, inserting a new north side to the chancel, new windows to the nave and east end, and adding the south aisle. The churchyard contains a notable [[Sarsen Stones|sarsen stone]] marking the grave of
[[Edmund Seyfang Taylor|Walker Miles]] whose work in the early days of the Rambler's movement contributed to the formation of the [[Ramblers]] of Great Britain.

At the same time, Sir George Gilbert Scott designed St Mary's almshouses next to St Nicholas Church for Mrs Mabel Hunt of Wonham House, in memory of her only daughter who had died at the age of sixteen. Built in a Victorian Tudor/gothic style, they include eight self contained houses, a wardens house and a beautiful little chapel, dedicated to St Mary. The fl<U+00E8>ch-capped chapel and the gables compose a very pretty hamlet.[[File:The Bell, Godstone.jpg|thumb|right|The Bell Inn]]

Godstone Green became a busy centre of roads and vehicles during the growth of wheeled traffic in the 16th century, an era which spawned the establishment of Godstone's numerous inns. A number of houses built entirely of brick appeared in the 18th Century, notably the row in the High Street.

During the 19th Century, The Pond at Godstone Green was used as a horse-pond with a sloping bank down which the wagoners drove their horses.

In the very core of the village is a triangular island, which in Victorian times, was densely packed with a remarkable number of cottages intersected by alleys. It is claimed to have been the worst slum in Surrey, which is no longer the case, with each dwelling having been paid much care and attention.

The two parts of Godstone are linked by Bullbeggars Lane, a narrow road leading from the south of the village to the church, and the footpath running from the White Hart pub and its barn, along Bay Pond to Church Lane. The original village around St Nicholas Church was decimated during the [[Black Death|great plague]] of 1342 with the victims being buried in two 'plague pits' in Bullbeggars Lane.  Even in death the sexes were kept separate.  Men and women were interred in separate pits.  The road running past the church was at one time the main coastal road with the present village not being built until Tudor times.  The Pack House featured in the [[Gracie Fields]] film 'Sing as you dance along', with Gracie dancing along the lane past the cottage which used to be an Inn.

===South Godstone===
South Godstone was originally known as ''Lagham'' and centred on the old medi<U+00E6>val moated manor house of Lagham, a scheduled ancient monument and Grade II* [[listed building]]. It also features a listed brew house, [[oast house]] and stable just north on its moat.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Heritage List for England|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1029769&searchtype=mapsearch|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref>  It forms a neighbourhood buffered by countryside immediately north of [[Godstone railway station]].

It has St Stephens Church, St Stephens C of E primary school, a fireplace shop, an antiques shop, a garage, and a sports and social club. There is a pub opposite the railway station, originally name 'The Railway' it has been renamed 'The Lagham.' serving Indian and Nepalese food.It is home to <ref>{{cite web|title=South Godstone FC|url=http://www.southgodstonefc.com|publisher=South Godstone Football Club Ltd}}</ref> whose first team currently compete in Intermediate Division One of the [[Surrey South Eastern Combination]], there are reserve, Sunday and youth teams. 

===Blindley Heath===

The same distance again to the south, separated by fields is the southernmost portion of the parish, centred on the hamlet of Blindley Heath.  Here there is a habitat of [[SSSI|special scientific interest]] of the same name that is the best known example of a relict damp grassland on Weald Clay in Surrey and has several ponds and a stretch of the Ray Brook.<ref>{{cite web|title=Natural England - SSSIs|url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/sssi_details.cfm?sssi_id=1004437|publisher=Natural England}}</ref>  There is an active [[Church of England|C of E]] church to St [[John the Evangelist]] built in 1842.<ref>{{cite web|title=Church of England "a church near you" website.|url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/blindley-heath-st-john-the-evangelist/|publisher=Church of England|accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref>

===The Enterdent===
This is a small parcel of land, tucked away in between Tilburstow Hill Road and Eastbourne Road, to the south of Godstone.<ref>Lotter, A (1988) "The Enterdent", Surrey Mirror, Thursday December 15, 1988, p.12</ref>

The name ''Enterdent'' alludes to a cluster of cottages on the land set in a wooded valley. The origin of the name the Enterdent has never been satisfactorily explained. It has previously been known as Lower and Upper Henterden, and in the 19th century, Polly Pains Bottom. It is perhaps the [[Dene (valley)|dene]] or valley between two hills.

The first two dwellings appeared in 1842, and improvements began on the cottages in 1857, now number 6 and 7 The Enterdent. These buildings were enlarged with an extension at the rear and five further cottages were added, making a row of seven. A second terrace of cottages, this time eight in number, appeared further up the valley.

Today the fifteen original cottages have been converted to eight homes. The additional five cottages from the original terrace have since been converted into two larger properties, number 1 comprising three cottages, and number 5 comprising the remaining two.  Numbers 6 and 7 still remain as individual cottages. At the entrance to the Enterdent, from Eastbourne Road, is a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]-style house, which was a tea room and a hotel from the 1920s to the 1940s. It has since been converted into two cottages, River Cottage and White Cottage.

Despite all the changes, the Enterdent has essentially remained relatively unaltered. The cottage gardens and vegetable [[Allotment (gardening)|allotment]]s stand to this day, so too does the [[sandpit]], the [[stream|brook]], the woods and the [[Hyacinthoides|bluebells]].
