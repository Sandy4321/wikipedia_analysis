'''Arthur Chevrolet''', (April 25, 1884 &ndash; April 16, 1946) was a [[Swiss American]] racecar driver and automobile manufacturer.

Born in [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]], [[Canton of Neuch<U+00E2>tel|Neuchatel]], [[Switzerland]], he was the middle brother of [[Louis Chevrolet|Louis]] (1878-1941) and [[Gaston Chevrolet]] (1892-1920). After brother Louis immigrated to [[United States|America]] and earned enough money, he sent for Gaston and Arthur to join him. Once there, Arthur worked as an automotive mechanic and joined his brother in auto racing. In 1911, he competed in the inaugural [[Indianapolis 500]] but had to drop out after 30 laps when his [[Buick]] developed mechanical problems. 

In 1916, Gaston Chevrolet became a partner with his brothers in the [[Frontenac Motor Corporation]]. Driving a Frontenac, he qualified for the Indianapolis 500 again in 1916, but was forced out after 35 laps when the car developed magneto problems. His driving career ended during practice rounds for the 1920 Indianapolis 500 when he was severely injured in a crash. Brother Gaston won that year's race but tragedy struck when Gaston was killed in a California race a few months later.

In 1928, Arthur filed with the US Patent Office for an 'Overhead Valve Engine'. Patent #1,744,526 was awarded on January 21, 1930.

In 1929 Louis and Arthur Chevrolet left the auto business altogether to form the Chevrolet Brothers Aircraft Company with a new engine of their design but could not make a go of the business and it was eventually taken over by investors. Arthur Chevrolet then began building sprint type race cars and became one of the pioneer leaders in that field. In 1990, his efforts were recognized when he was named to the [[National Sprint Car Hall of Fame & Museum]].

Eventually Arthur Chevrolet retired to [[Slidell, Louisiana]] where, suffering from depression, he committed suicide by hanging in 1946.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiritus-temporis.com/arthur-chevrolet/|title=Arthur Chevrolet - Biography of Arthur Chevrolet|publisher=www.spiritus-temporis.com|accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref>

Arthur Chevrolet is interred next to his brothers in the [[Roman Catholic]] Holy Cross and Saint Joseph Cemetery in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]].
