'''Ixlu''' is a small [[Maya civilization|Maya]] archaeological site that dates to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic and Postclassic Periods]].<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.618. Vald<U+00E9>s & Fahsen 2005, pp.151-152.</ref> It is located on the isthmus between the [[Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>]] and Salpet<U+00E9>n lakes, in the northern [[Pet<U+00E9>n Department]] of [[Guatemala]].<ref>Aguilar 2000, p.259.</ref> The site was an important port with access to Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> via the Ixlu River.<ref>Aguilar 2000, p.259.</ref> The site has been identified as '''Saklamakhal''', also spelt '''Saclemacal''', a capital of the [[Ko'woj|Kowoj]] Maya.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.618. Aguilar 2000, p.259.</ref>

The site has over 150 structures, the majority of which in the site core display typically Postclassic characteristics.<ref>S<U+00E1>nchez Polo ''et al'' 1995, p.592.</ref> The site was briefly investigated by Don and Prudence Rice in 1980.<ref>S<U+00E1>nchez Polo ''et al'' 1995, p.592.</ref>

Ixlu is located approximately {{convert|23|km|abbr=on}} east of the departmental capital of [[Flores, El Pet<U+00E9>n|Flores]] and {{convert|275|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Guatemala City]]. Ixlu is approximately {{convert|28|km|abbr=on}} south of the ruins of the major Classic Period city of [[Tikal]].

==Occupation==
Archaeological investigations have uncovered potsherds dating as far back as the early Middle Preclassic (1000 BC&ndash;800 BC).<ref>Aguilar 2000, p.261. S<U+00E1>nchez Polo ''et al'' 1995, p.593. Castellanos Cabrera 2008, p.7.</ref> Postclassic potsherds are widely distributed in the upper levels of the site to a depth of {{convert|30|to|40|cm|abbr=on}}.<ref>Aguilar 2000, p.261.</ref> Evidence from the Temple of the Hidden Jars indicates a continuous occupation from the Preclassic right through the Classic (AD 200&ndash;900) to the Postclassic Period (AD 900&ndash;1525), with occupation continuing until approximately 1700, well after the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish Conquest]] of most of Guatemala, according to [[ethnohistory|ethnohistoric]] sources.<ref>Aguilar 2000, p.261.</ref> The Pet<U+00E9>n Lakes region finally fell to the Spanish Crown in 1697,<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp.776-778.</ref> at which time Ixlu was in disputed territory between the mutually hostile [[Itza]] and Kowoj kingdoms.<ref>Jones 2009, p.62.</ref>

==Structures==
Fifty structures have been mapped at Ixlu by the Central Peten Historical Ecology Project.<ref>Bey, Hanson & Ringle 1997, p.247.</ref> Nine of these are C-shaped bench superstructures and two are L-shaped.<ref>Bey, Hanson & Ringle 1997, p.247.</ref>

Ixlu has two [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]] and is one of only two Postclassic sites in the central Pet<U+00E9>n lakes region to have a recognisable ballcourt.<ref>Vald<U+00E9>s & Fahsen 2005, pp.151-152.</ref> However, both ballcourts at Ixlu apparently date to the Late Classic.<ref>Vald<U+00E9>s & Fahsen 2005, pp.151-152.</ref> The site possesses a twin-pyramid complex, a feature that is rare outside of Tikal and probably indicates the political influence of that great city.<ref>Martin & Grube 2000, p.51.</ref>

[[Image:Tayasal.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Altar 1 from Ixlu, which contains a section of text comprising eight glyphs that are identical to a phrase on Dos Pilas Stela 8<ref>Schele & Freidel 1990, p.390.</ref>]]
The architecture at Ixlu resembles that at the Late Classic site of [[Seibal]] on the [[Pasi<U+00F3>n River]].<ref>chele & Freidel 1990, p.389.</ref>

===The Temple of the Hidden Jars===
The Temple of the Hidden Jars (''Templo de las Vasijas Escondidas'') has been labelled as Structure 2034.<ref>Aguilar 2000, p.259.</ref> It is bordered by Structure 2041 on the south side, Structure 2036 to the west and Structure 2035 to the north, its eastern side faces onto Patio B.<ref>Aguilar 2000, p.259.</ref> The temple measures {{convert|13.9|by|9.6|m|ft}} and consisted of a two-level platform, the first level was {{convert|1.15|m|ft}} high and the second level had a height of {{convert|1.2|m|ft}}.<ref>Aguilar 2000, pp.259-260.</ref> The temple has been dated to the Late Postclassic Period (AD 1200-1525).<ref>Aguilar 2000, p.260.</ref> A stairway ascended the west side of the temple and there was an altar on the summit that measured {{convert|1|m|ft}}.<ref>Aguilar 2000, pp.259-260.</ref> The temple is named from two hidden niches on the west side of the temple, one at the foot of the stairway and the second under an altar on the temple steps.<ref>Aguilar 2000, p.261.</ref> Each contained a single red-brown ceramic vessel measuring approximately {{convert|16|cm|in}} in diameter and {{convert|14|cm|in}} high, each with its respective concave lid.<ref>Aguilar 2000, p.261.</ref> The vessels have four handles spaced equidistantly around the circumference, with the lids also possessing a handle.<ref>Aguilar 2000, pp.261, 273.</ref> The jars contained only brown soil.<ref>Aguilar 2000, p.261.</ref> This style of hidden niche is similar to niches associated with ceremonial structures in distant [[Mayapan]] in the north of the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]].<ref>Aguilar 2000, p.261.</ref>

==Monuments==
Four Classic Period sculpted monuments were recovered from the site, two [[stela]]e and two [[altars]].<ref>S<U+00E1>nchez Polo ''et al'' 1995, p.593.</ref> Ixlu Stela 1 bears the date 879 AD, in the Late Classic Period, and depicts a ruler who used the [[Tikal]] [[Maya script#Emblem glyphs|Emblem Glyph]] and the ''K'ul Mutul Ahaw'' title ("holy lord of Tikal").<ref>Vald<U+00E9>s & Fahsen 2005, pp.9, 151. Drew 1999, p.352.</ref> The stelae at Ixlu resemble traditional Classic Period stelae such as those at Tikal.<ref>Schele & Freidel 1990, p.389.</ref> Both Stelae 1 and 2 show bloodletting rituals and the materialisation of the [[Maya religion|Paddler Gods]].<ref>Schele & Freidel 1990, p.389.</ref> Ixlu Stela 2 is now located in the main plaza of [[Flores, El Pet<U+00E9>n|Flores]].<ref>Kelly 1996, p.111.</ref>

The monuments of Ixlu bear some hieroglyphic texts that closely resemble texts from the site of [[Dos Pilas]], suggesting that the lords of Ixlu may have been refugees from the collapse of that state in the [[Petexbat<U+00FA>n]] region of the [[Pet<U+00E9>n Basin]],<ref>Schele & Freidel 1990, pp.389-390, 505n20.</ref> a state that itself professed to have a legitimate claim to the rulership of Tikal.<ref>Webster 2002, p.275.</ref>
