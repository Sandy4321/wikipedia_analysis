'''Cairo''' is a [[software library]] used to provide a [[vector graphics]]-based, device-independent [[Application programming interface|API]] for [[software developer]]s. It is designed to provide primitives for [[2-dimensional]] drawing across a number of different backends. Cairo is designed to use [[hardware acceleration]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cairographics.org/ | title = Cairo homepage | accessdate = 2010-10-30 }}</ref> when available.

It is written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and has [[Language binding|bindings]] available for many programming languages, including [[C++]], [[PHP]], [[Factor (programming language)|Factor]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[Smalltalk]] and several others.<ref>[http://cairographics.org/bindings Language bindings<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Cairo is [[free software]]. The majority of it is [[Dual license]]d under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] and the [[Mozilla Public License]], though some parts of it are licensed only under the [[GNU General Public License]].

== History ==

The cairo project was founded by [[Keith Packard]] and Carl Worth for use in the [[X Window System]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Xr: Cross-device Rendering for Vector Graphics | url=http://cworth.org/~cworth/papers/xr_ols2003/html/ | accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref> It was originally called '''Xr''' or '''Xr/Xc'''.  The name was changed to emphasize the idea that it was a cross-platform library and not tied to the [[X server]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Mailing list thread about the cairo name change | url=http://lists.cairographics.org/archives/cairo/2003-July/000192.html | accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref> The name ''cairo'' was derived from the original name ''Xr'', similar to the Greek letters [[chi (letter)|chi]] and [[rho (letter)|rho]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Mailing list thread about the cairo name change | url=http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/cairo/2003-July/000184.html | accessdate=2006-12-02}}</ref>

== Backends ==

Cairo supports output to a number of different [[backend]]s, known as "surfaces" in its code. Backend support includes output to the [[X Window System]], [[Graphics Device Interface|Win32 GDI]], [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Mac OS X Quartz]], the [[BeOS]] API, [[OS/2]], [[OpenGL]] contexts (directly<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lists.cairographics.org/archives/cairo/2009-July/017713.html |title=New OpenGL backend merged |author=Chris Wilson |date=2009-07-22 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref> and via [[Glitz (software)|glitz]]), local image buffers, [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] files, [[Portable document format|PDF]], [[PostScript]], [[DirectFB]] and [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] files.

There are other backends in development targeting the graphics APIs [[OpenVG]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/cairo/2008-January/012833.html |title=Announcing OpenVG backend |author=<U+00D8>yvind Kol<U+00E5>s |date=2008-01-24 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref> [[Qt (framework)|Qt]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.vlad1.com/2008/05/06/well-isnt-that-qt/ |title=Well Isn<U+2019>t That Qt |author=Vladimir Vuki<U+0107>evi<U+0107> |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref> [[Skia Graphics Engine|Skia]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lists.cairographics.org/archives/cairo/2009-August/018052.html |title=Cool Stuff |author=Chris Wilson |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref> and Windows' [[Direct2D]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.basschouten.com/blog1.php/2009/11/22/direct2d-hardware-rendering-a-browser |title=Direct2D: Hardware Rendering a Browser |author=Bas Schouten |date=2009-11-22 |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref>

== Notable usage ==

Cairo is popular in the open source community for providing cross-platform support for advanced 2D drawing.

* [[GTK+]], starting in 2005 with version 2.8, uses cairo to render the majority of its [[widget (computing)|widget]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/02/04/2021236 |title=GTK+ to Use Cairo Vector Engine |accessdate=2009-12-27}}</ref>
* The [[Mono (software)|Mono Project]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mono-project.com/Drawing |title=Mono - Drawing |accessdate=2009-12-27}}</ref> including [[Moonlight (runtime)|Moonlight]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mono-project.com/MoonlightNotes#Rendering |title=Moonlight Notes |accessdate=2009-12-27}}</ref> has been using cairo since very early in conception to power the backends of its [[GDI+]] (libgdiplus) and System.Drawing [[Namespace (computer science)|namespaces]].
* The [[Mozilla]] project has made use of cairo in recent versions of its [[Gecko layout engine]], used for rendering the graphical output of Mozilla products. Gecko 1.8, the layout engine for Mozilla Firefox 2.0 and [[SeaMonkey]] 1.0, used cairo to render SVG and [[Canvas element|<canvas>]] content. Gecko 1.9,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko_1.9_Roadmap#cairo_Graphics_Substrate |title=Gecko 1.9 Roadmap |accessdate=2009-12-27}}</ref> the release of Gecko that serves as the basis of [[Mozilla Firefox 3|Firefox 3]], uses cairo as the graphics backend for rendering both web page content and the [[user interface]] (or "chrome").
* The [[WebKit]] framework uses cairo for all rendering in the [[GTK+]] and [[Enlightenment_Foundation_Libraries|EFL]] ports. Support has also been added for SVG and <canvas> content using cairo.
* The [[Poppler (software)|Poppler]] library uses cairo to render PDF documents. Cairo enables the drawing of antialiased vector graphics and transparent objects.
* The vector graphics application [[Inkscape]] uses the cairo library for its outline mode display, as well as for [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] and [[PostScript]] export since release 0.46.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/ReleaseNotes046 |title=ReleaseNotes046 |work=Inkscape Wiki |accessdate=2008-03-31}}</ref>
* [[MorphOS]] 2.5 features a shared library implementation of cairo, which was available as stand-alone release for earlier MorphOS versions.
* [[AmigaOS]] 4.1 supports a shared object library of cairo (libcairo.so) in its default installation.
* [[FontForge]] switched to cairo for all rendering in mid-October 2008.
* [[R (programming language)|R]] can output plots in [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[PostScript]] and [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] formats using cairo if available.
* [[Gnuplot]] 4.4 now uses cairo for rendering [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] and [[Portable_Network_Graphics|PNG]] output.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gnuplot.info/announce.4.4.0 | title = Gnuplot version 4.4.0 announcement | work = Gnuplot homepage | accessdate = 2011-02-22}}</ref>
* Internet Browser for PlayStation 3 uses cairo since system software update 4.10.
