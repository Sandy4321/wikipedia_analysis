'''Nightmarch''', foaled in 1925 was an outstanding [[New Zealand]] bred [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse known as ''The Kiwi''. He won the [[New Zealand Derby]] and Dunedin Cup as a three-year-old before going to [[Australia]] where he became the first horse to win both the [[Melbourne Cup]] and [[Cox Plate]] in the same year, as well as other [[Group races|Principal races]].

He was by [[Night Raid]], the sire of Phar Lap, out of the good racemare and broodmare, Marsa (1911) by Martian, a mare that traced to Manto. Marsa produced five foals, all of which raced and were winners.

==Racing record==
As a two-year-old he had eight starts and won two, the Dunedin J.C. Juvenile (by two lengths) and Hopeful Handicaps, having [[Tie (draw)|dead heated]] with Full Feather in the latter race.

Nightmarch was then sold privately to Alan Louisson, and won the Canterbury Linwood Handicap, [[New Zealand Derby]], Marton Cup, Dunedin Cup, and Great Autumn Handicap for him when he was a three-year-old.<ref name="Barrie">Barrie, Douglas M., "The Australian Bloodhorse'', Angus & Robertson, Sydney, 1956</ref>

In the spring of 1929, Louisson took Nightmarch to Sydney where he was unplaced in his first start at [[Rosehill, New South Wales]]. The big betting punter, Eric Connolly offered <U+00A3>10,000 for Nightmarch (which was rejected) after a [[betting plunge]] by others, had been made on Nightmarch's [[Metropolitan Handicap]] winning chances. Connolly instead became the horse's "campaign manager" and his training was then altered to suit the one mile of the AJC [[Epsom Handicap]] instead of the 13 furlongs of the Metropolitan Handicap. A big betting plunge succeeded then when Nightmarch won the Tattersall's Spring Handicap.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/horseracing/how-night-vision-highlighted-a-mastermind/2006/11/06/1162661619228.html SMH: Eric Connolly played the Melbourne Cup and won, writes Max Presnell] Retrieved 2010-9-18</ref> A Metropolitan Handicap start agreed upon and was won by Loquacious (a sister to Windbag) with Nightmarch, who carried 9 st. 12&nbsp;lbs.

After the race Connolly received numerous threatening phone calls, some indicating possible personal injury.<ref name="Cavanough">Cavanough, Maurice, ''The Melbourne Cup'', Jack Pollard P/L, North Sydney, 1976</ref>

Nightmarch firmed from 20-1 to 3-1 favourite before he won the AJC [[Epsom Handicap]] (carrying 9 stone 4 pounds). Following this he won the Randwick Plate, the [[W S Cox Plate]] and the Melbourne Cup (after another huge betting plunge by Connolly, which netted him at least <U+00A3>100,000) with two pounds over [[weight-for-age]] from Phar Lap.<ref>''Bookmakers did not wake up to Nighmarch plunge'', p. 30, Racetrack magazine, April 1982</ref> After that, until the end of his long career, Nightmarch was seldom unplaced. In [[Dunedin, New Zealand]] Nightmarch won the James Hazlett Gold Cup and back again in [[New South Wales]] won the Rawson Stakes and AJC Autumn Stakes (defeating Amounis). During his four-year-old season he had a total of 16 starts for 8 wins, 3 seconds and 4 thirds.<ref>[http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080099b.htm?hilite=connolly ADB: Connolly, Eric Alfred (1880 - 1944)] Retrieved 2010-9-18</ref>

As a five-year-old he placed third to Amounis and Phar Lap in the Warwick Stakes and was also third in the Canterbury Stakes. In his next four starts he ran second to Phar Lap each time<U+2014>in the Chelmsford Stakes, Hill Stakes, AJC Spring Stakes, and [[Craven Plate]]. Back in New Zealand he won the [[New Zealand Cup]] and Canterbury Cup and was second in the GG Stead Memorial Gold Cup before winning the Trentham Gold Cup and Awapuni Cup, and ended his fourth racing season with a second at Canterbury, New Zealand, in the CJC Challenge Stakes, conceding the winner 43 pounds.<ref name="Pring"/>

At his first start as a six-year-old Nightmarch was second in the James Hazlett Gold Cup. Back in Sydney, Ammon Ra defeated him into second place in both the Rawson Stakes and AJC Chipping Norton Stakes. His won his next two races, the AJC Autumn Stakes and AJC Cumberland Stakes, which he won from Veilmond on each occasion. In the A.J.C. Plate he was unplaced to Veilmond but finished the racing year by again winning the Awapuni Cup.<ref name="Pring"/><ref>[http://www.studbook.org.au/horse.aspx?hid=6312&pagetype=RACEWINS ASB: Nightmarch (NZ) - wins] Retrieved 2010-9-18</ref>

As a seven-year-old Nightmarch did not win again, although he was second to Peter Pan by half a length in the Rosehill Hill Stakes next spring. His last stake-earning was third place behind Veilmond in the AJC Spring Stakes.

===Summary===
Nightmarch was the first horse to win both the [[Melbourne Cup]] and [[Cox Plate]] in the same year (1929), a feat repeated by Phar Lap the following year (1930), fellow New Zealand racehorse [[Rising Fast]] in 1954, [[Saintly]] in 1996 and [[Makybe Diva]] in 2005. Overall he had 69 starts for 23<U+00BD> wins (including a [[Tie (draw)|dead heat]]), 18 seconds and 11 thirds for <U+00A3>32,116. At the time the two greats [[Gloaming (horse)|Gloaming]] and Nightmarch were considered [[New Zealand]]'s true champions.<ref name="Barrie"/>
