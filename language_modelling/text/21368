'''Anthony John "Tony" Abbott''' (born 4 November 1957) is the current [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the [[Australian House of Representatives]] and federal leader of the [[centre-right]] [[Liberal Party of Australia]].

Representing the seat of [[Division of Warringah|Warringah]] since the [[Warringah by-election, 1994|1994 by-election]], Abbott was [[Minister for Employment Participation (Australia)|Minister for Employment Services]], [[Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations (Australia)|Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations]], and [[Minister for Health and Ageing (Australia)|Minister for Health and Ageing]] in the [[Howard government]] at various times from 1998 to 2007, and Leader of the House of Representatives in the [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]] from 2001 to 2007. After the defeat of the Howard government at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]], he was Shadow [[Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs]] until he resigned from the [[Malcolm Turnbull]] [[Shadow Cabinet (Australia) September 2008 to November 2009|shadow cabinet]] in protest against Liberal Party policy on 26 November 2009.<ref>http://www.theage.com.au/national/abbott-quits-as-new-leadership-revolt-escalates-20091126-jtzh.html</ref> Following a successful spill motion, Abbott defeated Turnbull 42 votes to 41 in the [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership election, 2009|Liberal Party of Australia leadership election of 2009]]. 

== Early life and family ==
 
Abbott was born in [[London]], England<ref name="houseofrepsbio">{{cite web | url = http://www.aph.gov.au/house/members/biography.asp?id=EZ5 | title = The Hon Tony Abbott MP, Member for Warringah (NSW) - Parliament of Australia: House of Representatives biography | accessdate = 2006-04-04 }}</ref> to Australian parents. In 1960, his family returned to Australia, living first in the [[Sydney]] suburbs of [[Bronte, New South Wales|Bronte]] then moving to [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]]. Abbott was schooled at [[St Aloysius' College (Sydney)|St Aloysius' College]] before completing his secondary school education at [[Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview|St Ignatius' College, Riverview]] in [[Sydney]].<ref name="Sunday Profile">{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/The-Abbott-paradox/2005/03/24/1111525288735.html | title=The Abbott paradox | author= Jason Koutsoukis|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=2005-03-25|accessdate=2009-12-1}}</ref> He graduated from the [[University of Sydney]], residing at [[St John's College, University of Sydney|St John's College]], with a Bachelor of Economics (BEc) and a Bachelor of Laws (LLB).<ref name="houseofrepsbio" /> At university he was active in student politics, gaining media attention for his political stance opposing the then dominant left-wing student leadership. He was also a prominent student boxer. He then went on to attend the [[Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] as a [[Rhodes Scholar]] and graduated with a Master of Arts (MA). Said to be a devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], he wanted to join the Catholic priesthood, and entered [[St Patrick's Seminary, Manly]]. It was this time in the seminary that earned Abbott the nickname "The Mad Monk".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/27/2755182.htm |title=The Liberal Catch-22 |date=26 November 2009 |work= |publisher=[[The 7.30 Report|ABC 7:30 Report]] |accessdate=27 November 2009}}</ref> He subsequently decided to leave the seminary and choose another career path.

Despite his right-wing leanings, Abbott has acknowledged he voted [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] in the [[New South Wales state election, 1988|1988 NSW State Election]] as he thought "[[Barrie Unsworth]] was the best deal Premier that New South Wales had ever had."<ref name="Sunday Profile">{{ cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/sundayprofile/stories/s1389511.htm|title=Tony Abbott: Sunday Profile|author=Monica Attard|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2005-06-12|accessdate=2007-11-28}}</ref>

After leaving the seminary, Abbott worked as a journalist for ''[[The Bulletin]]'', an influential news magazine, and ''[[The Australian]]''. He became well-known for his strongly worded criticism of [[trade union]]s and left-wing politics. For a period, Abbott was a plant manager for [[Pioneer Concrete]] before becoming press secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, [[John Hewson|Dr John Hewson]] in 1990-93.  Between 1993 and 1994 he was the Executive Director of [[Australians for Constitutional Monarchy]].<ref name="houseofrepsbio" />

Abbott is married to Margaret, with whom he has three daughters (Louise, Bridget and Frances).<ref name="partypage">{{cite web | title = Tony Abbott-Liberal for Warringah - About Tony | url = http://www.tonyabbott.com.au/abouttony.aspx | accessdate = 2006-04-04 }}</ref>

When Abbott was 19 his then girlfriend became pregnant. She was keen to get married but Abbott refused, so she left him seven months into her pregnancy. She later gave birth to a son and had him adopted.<ref name="Summers2005-02-25">{{cite news | last = Summers | first = Anne | date = 25 February 2005 | title = Abbott's tale is grubbier than it seems | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | location = [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2005/02/24/1109180038442.html | accessdate = 4 December 2009 }}</ref> Abbott believed that he fathered this child.<ref>{{Cite news|last = Murphy|first = Damien|title = Abbott's love child turns into shaggy dog story|newspaper = The Sydney Morning Herald|pages = 1|publisher = Fairfax Media|date = 22 March 2005|url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Abbotts-love-child-turns-into-a-shaggy-dog-story/2005/03/21/1111253960197.html|accessdate = 04 December 2009}}</ref> The identity of this son was not known until late 2004, when it was publicly revealed that he was an [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] sound recordist who worked in [[Parliament House]], [[Canberra]], and who had often been involved in making television programs in which Abbott appeared.<ref name="Abbott reunited">{{ cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200502/s1306958.htm|title=Abbott reunited with long-lost son|author=|work=ABC News Online|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2005-03-21|accessdate=2007-11-28 }}</ref> [[DNA testing]] later revealed, however, that Abbott was not the man's father.<ref name="DNA Test">{{ cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200503/s1328485.htm|title=DNA test shows Abbott not father of 'son'|author=|work=ABC News Online|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2005-03-21|accessdate=2007-11-28 }}</ref>

== Political life ==

Abbott was elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives]] for the [[Division of Warringah]] at a [[Warringah by-election, 1994|by-election in March 1994]] following the resignation of [[Michael MacKellar]]. He served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (1996-98), Minister for Employment Services (1998-2001), [[Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations (Australia)|Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Small Business]] (2001), Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations (2001-03) and Minister for Health and Ageing from 2003 to November 2007.

As Minister for Health and Ageing, Abbott introduced the [[Medicare (Australia)#Medicare Safety Net|Medicare Safety Net]] to cap the annual [[Out-of-pocket expenses|out-of-pocket costs]] of Medicare cardholders to a maximum amount. In 2007, he attracted criticism over long delays in funding for cancer diagnostic equipment ([[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scanners).<ref name="ABC20070709_730Report">{{ cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2007/s1998936.htm|title='Scientific fraud' hampered spread of cancer technique|author=Matt Peacock|work=7.30 Report|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2007-07-09|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref><ref name="ABC20070711_News">{{ cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/07/11/1975390.htm|title=Govt rethinks PET scan funding decision|author=Alison Caldwell|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2007-07-11|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref><ref name="ABC20070926_730Report">{{ cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2007/s2043989.htm|title=Cancer detection technology waits for Govt approval|author=Matt Peacock|work=7.30 Report|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2007-09-26|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref><ref name="ABC20070927_News">{{ cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/27/2044610.htm|title=Doctors angry as PET scan delay wears on|author=Matt Peacock|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2007-09-27|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref>

Abbott is widely known as an outspoken [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] [[Catholic]]. Abbott sees reducing the number of [[abortion]]s performed each year as a national priority. In March 2004 he asked "Why isn't the fact that 100,000 women choose to end their pregnancies regarded as a national tragedy approaching the scale, say, of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] [[life expectancy]] being 20 years less than that of the general community?" <ref name="Catholic News">{{ cite news|url=http://www.cathnews.com/news/403/97.php|title=Abbott stirs Christians on abortion complacency|author=|work=|publisher=Catholic News|date=2004-03-17|accessdate=2007-11-28 }}</ref> Abbott promised to launch an investigation into a product called [[Baby Gender Mentor#Competition|Pink or Blue]], which is made by [[United Kingdom|UK-based]] DNA Worldwide, a division of [[United States|US-based]] Consumer Genetics. This test is one of several pre-natal blood tests designed to detect the sex of a fetus as early as six weeks into pregnancy.  Ethicists have raised concerns that knowing the sex of a foetus so early into pregnancy would facilitate [[Sex-selective abortion and infanticide]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,21715528-5001021,00.html | title=Pick-your-baby test investigated | publisher=The Daily Telegraph | date=May 12, 2007 | author=Masters, Clare | accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref>

A [[conscience vote]] took place in February 2006, approving a measure that deprived the Health Minister of regulatory control of the abortion drug [[RU486]]. Abbott and previous Health Ministers had decided not to allow it to be made available. Abbott responded to the vote by calling for funding of alternative counselling to pregnant women through church-affiliated groups.  During this time he criticised the acceptance of abortion, saying "... we have a bizarre double standard, a bizarre double standard in this country where someone who kills a pregnant woman's baby is guilty of murder but a woman who aborts an unborn baby is simply exercising choice."<ref name="AM on RU486">{{ cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2006/s1571075.htm|title=MPs to vote on RU486 control|author=Jennifer Macey|work=AM, ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2006-02-16|accessdate=2007-11-28 }}</ref>

Abbott opposed allowing the introduction of [[Embryonic stem cell research]] or ''[[therapeutic cloning]]'' in another [[conscience vote]], preferring continued use of [[Adult stem cell]]s for research into cures for debilitating diseases. He argued that:
"there are very important ethical questions here and even the very best end does not justify every possible means."<ref name="Cloning laws">{{ cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/science/abbott-opposes-call-to-relax-cloning-laws/2005/09/29/1127804597157.html|title=Abbott opposes call to relax cloning laws|author=AAP, with Chris Evans|work=|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2005-08-29|accessdate=2007-11-28 }}</ref>
He has proposed a return to [[Divorce#At-fault_divorce|at-fault divorce]], similar to the ''Matrimonial Causes Act'', which would require spouses to prove offences like adultery, habitual drunkenness or cruelty before a divorce is granted.

Abbott is a supporter of the [[Queen of Australia|constitutional monarchy]] in Australia. He has previously accused some sections of the Australia public of "suffering self-imposed historical and cultural amnesia" in relation to Australia's British heritage and acting like "teenagers blowing raspberries at their parents".<ref name="Menzies Lecture">{{ cite news|url=http://www.nationalobserver.net/2004_spring_abbott.htm|title=The Brother Countries|author=Tony Abbott|work=|publisher=National Observer|date=2004-05-17|accessdate=2007-11-28 }}</ref>

After the Coalition lost government in 2007 and he lost his health portfolio, in Opposition Abbott was re-elected to the seat of Warringah with a 1.79% swing toward the Labor Party.<ref name="2007_Election">{{cite web | url=http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-13745-151.htm | title=Australian Electoral Commission summary of Warringah, Federal Election 2007. | publisher=''[[Australian Electoral Commission]]'' | date=2007-12-19 | accessdate=2007-12-19}}</ref> Following [[Peter Costello]]'s rejection of the leadership of the Parliamentary Liberal Party, Abbott [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership election, 2007|nominated for the position of party leader]], along with [[Malcolm Turnbull]] and [[Brendan Nelson]].

At an October, 2009, meeting in the town of [[Beaufort, Victoria]], Abbott told the audience that the concept of [[Global warming|climate change]] was "absolute crap". Some months later, when questioned about that statement, he said he had used "a bit of hyperbole" at that meeting, rather than it being his "considered position".<ref>{{cite news |title=We will have climate policy, Abbott says |author=[[Michelle Grattan]] |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=2 December 2009 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/we-will-have-climate-policy-abbott-says-20091201-k3vb.html }}</ref>  On 1 December 2009, he succeeded Malcolm Turnbull as leader of the Opposition, defeating Turnbull and [[Joe Hockey]] in a leadership ballot, with [[Julie Bishop]] remaining as deputy leader.

{{criticism}}
* In May 2006, Abbott, as Leader of the House, called the Opposition MP, [[Kelvin Thompson]], a "snivelling grub" in the Parliament for speaking about [[National Party of Australia|Nationals]] MP [[John Anderson (Australian politician)|John Anderson]]'s shares in the [[Cole Inquiry|disgraced]] [[Australian Wheat Board]]. Abbott then said "If I've offended grubs, I withdraw unconditionally." The comments were not widely reported until a week later when (Labor's) Manager of Opposition Business [[Julia Gillard]] (then Shadow Minister for Health and Ageing) used exactly the same phrase about Abbott, refused to withdraw it, and was ejected from Parliament for 24 hours with [[David Hawker#Questions over impartiality|questions over Speaker impartiality]]. Abbott later told the Parliament "It would have been better if I had not moved the motion in the terms that I originally did."<ref name="Gillard Ejected">{{ cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2006/s1652219.htm|title=Gillard ejected over 'snivelling grub' remark|author=Louise Yaxley|work=PM, ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2006-05-31|accessdate=2007-11-28 }}</ref>

* In July 2007, Abbott gained attention after swearing once on a national TV interview and repeating the phrase when asked about the incident by journalists the next day. After renewed controversy over John Howard's alleged broken promise to hand over the Liberal leadership position to Peter Costello, Abbott said to an interviewer: "Not to put too fine a point on it, shit happens, Tony". When asked if he regretted it he cackled and repeated "shit happens", receiving some laughs from the journalists.<ref name="TV Swearing">{{ cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22104377-29277,00.html|title=S**t, Tony Abbott swears on TV|author=|work=|publisher=News.com.au|date=2007-07-20|accessdate=2007-11-28 }}</ref>

* In the 2007 federal election campaign, Abbott was again drawn into controversy over comments he made about [[asbestos]] campaigner [[Bernie Banton]]. Banton, who was suffering from terminal [[mesothelioma]], attempted to deliver a petition to Abbott's electorate office in [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]]. As Abbott was not there, he was accused of being "gutless". Abbott said the event was a ''stunt'' and said: "I know Bernie is very sick, but just because a person is sick doesn't mean that he is necessarily pure of heart in all things." Abbott later apologised for the comments.<ref name="Asbestos Comments">{{ cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22678290-5013945,00.html|title=Abbott insults asbestos sufferer|author=Sid Marris & AAP|work=|publisher=The Australian|date=2007-10-31|accessdate=2007-11-28 }}</ref>

* The next day, 30 October 2007, Abbott arrived more than 30 minutes late for a nationally televised debate with his Labor counterpart in the health portfolio ([[Nicola Roxon]]) after being held up by masses of journalists in relation to the incident the day before. Roxon answered questions and joked with the media about "debating herself" while waiting. After the debate, Abbott was heard saying to Roxon that her suggestion that he could have made the debate on time was "[[bullshit]]".<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/video/2007/10/31/2077894.htm Tony Abbott caught swearing at Nicola Roxon: ABC News 31/10/2007]</ref><ref name="Campaign Wheels">{{ cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22688978-11949,00.html|title=Liberal campaign wheels get wobbly|author= John Lyons|work=|publisher=The Australian|date=2007-11-02|accessdate=2007-11-28 }}</ref> Abbott was a recipient of ''[[The Chaser Decides]]''' 'Mal Award' for this and later bungles in the campaign.

It was Sharples' legal action that laid the basis for the prosecution of the One Nation founders, Pauline Hanson and [[David Ettridge]], which ultimately resulted in Hanson being imprisoned.<ref name="Watchdog">{{ cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/27/1061663855108.html|title=Watchdog rethinks Liberal links to Abbott's slush fund|author=Mike Seccombe and Damien Murphy|work=|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2003-08-28|accessdate=2007-11-28 }}</ref>

Opposition MP [[Craig Emerson]] demanded to know where the money for the trust, reportedly $100,000, had come from, saying that taxpayers had a right to know.<ref name="Emerson">{{ cite news|url=http://www.australianpolitics.com/news/2003/08/03-08-26.shtml|title=Truth Overboard Again Says ALP|author=Craig Emerson|work=Doorstop Interview|publisher=AustralianPolitics.com|date=2003-08-26|accessdate=2007-11-28 }}</ref>
Treasurer [[Peter Costello]] said of Abbott's actions, "I don't think that the way to resolve political disputes is through the courts. I think the way to resolve it is at the ballot box."<ref name="Costello Riley">{{ cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/02/1062403516586.html|title=Costello does it his way|author=Mark Riley|work=|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2003-09-03|accessdate=2007-11-28 }}</ref>

The conviction against Hanson was ultimately overturned, leading to criticism of a range of polititians for political interference by the adjudicating justice. Abbott conceded that the political threat One Nation posed to the Howard Government was "a very big factor" in his decision to pursue the legal attack, but he also claimed to be acting "in Australia's national interest". Mr Howard also defended Abbott's actions saying "It's the job of the Liberal Party to politically attack other parties - there's nothing wrong with that."<ref name="Watchdog"/>
