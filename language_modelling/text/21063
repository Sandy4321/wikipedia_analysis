'''The Royal Bank of Canada Plaza''', also reffered to as the ''RBC Plaza'' or the ''RBC Tower'', is the largest and tallest [[skyscraper]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].  Standing 540 feet tall, the RBC Plaza building encompasses more than 730,000 square feet of office and retail space, parking and residential condominiums.  The building at the corner of [[Fayetteville Street]], Martin Street and Wilmington Street serves as corporate headquarters for [[RBC Centura]], the U.S. banking arm of [[Royal Bank of Canada]].

RBC Centura had been courted for years by cities across the East Coast to move its headquarters from [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina|Rocky Mount]], and in August 2005, CEO [[Scott Custer]] announced the bank's intentions to relocate to downtown Raleigh.  RBC wanted a tall building that would add to the Raleigh skyline, but the bank needed only 130,000 square feet of office space, enough to fill about five floors of an office building. So, Highwoods partnered with Dominion Partners of Raleigh to build 139 residential condos on top of the office building, enough to stretch the building to 33 floors and make it taller than any other office building in the Triangle.   

As a testament to the plan's success, all of the RBC Plaza condominiums sold out in August 2008, less than three months after Dominion started taking non-refundable deposits on the units, which ranged in price from $230,000 to $800,000.   There are separate lobbies for the office tenants and the residential tenants, a rooftop swimming pool for residents, and a second parking garage with 1,050 spaces across the street. The building has 275,000 square feet of office space on 11 floors, of which 65 percent is leased to RBC Centura and Raleigh law firm [[Poyner & Spruill]]. In September 2009, the Raleigh office of the [[Williams Mullen]] law firm moved into 62,500 square feet of office space, located on floors 15, 16 and 17 of the RBC Plaza. The facility also has 17,000 square feet of street-level retail and seven floors of parking.<ref>http://triangle.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/2008/01/07/story12.html</ref>

==RBC Bank USA==

[[RBC]] has a large retail banking presence in the southeastern United States, marketing itself there as [[RBC Bank]]. [[RBC Bank]] is headquartered in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. The bank has recently merged with [[Flag Bank]], increasing its presence in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. RBC continues to grow in the Southeast after acquiring 39 branches of [[AmSouth Bank]] in Alabama on March 9, 2007 (previously RBC Centura had no locations in this state). RBC announced on January 17, 2008 that it would abandon the "[[Centura]]" brand in April 2008 and the U.S. operations would operate as [[RBC Bank]]. RBC's footprint in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida expanded significantly after its acquisition of [[Alabama National Bancorporation]] in June 2008.

==RBC presence in Raleigh, NC==

The building of the RBC Plaza is not the first major move by RBC to become a major part of the community in [[Raleigh, NC]].  In 2002, RBC purchased the naming rights for the [[Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena]], home to the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] of the [[National Hockey League]] and [[North Carolina State University]] basketball. The arena was renamed the [[RBC Center]], with a 20-year lease at a cost of $80 million. In June 2006, the RBC Center was host for the NHL's [[Stanley Cup]] Finals, and on June 19, 2006, the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] defeated the [[Edmonton Oilers]] in the [[RBC Center]] to win the [[Stanley Cup]].
