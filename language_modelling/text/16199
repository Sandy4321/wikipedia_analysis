The '''fifth season''' of the [[science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]'' commenced airing on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network in the United States on November 2, 1997, concluding on the same channel on May 17, 1998, and contained 20 episodes. The season was the last in [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]]; subsequent episodes would be shot in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. In addition, this was the first season of the show where the course of the story was planned in advance, due to the 1998 [[The X-Files (film)|''The X-Files'' feature film]] being filmed before it, but schedule to be released after it aired.

The fifth season of the series focused heavily on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] federal agents [[Fox Mulder]]'s ([[David Duchovny]]) loss of faith in the existence of [[extraterrestrials]] and his partner, [[Dana Scully]]'s ([[Gillian Anderson]]), resurgence of health following her bout with cancer. New characters were also introduced, including agents [[Jeffrey Spender]] ([[Chris Owens (actor)|Chris Owens]]) and [[Diana Fowley]] ([[Mimi Rogers]]) and the psychic [[Gibson Praise]] (Jeff Gulka). The finale, "[[The End (The X-Files)|The End]]", led up to both the 1998 film and the [[The X-Files (season 6)|sixth season]] premiere "[[The Beginning (The X-Files)|The Beginning]]".

Debuting with high viewing figures and ranking as the eleventh most watched television series during the [[1997<U+2013>98 United States network television schedule|1997<U+2013>98]] television year in the United States, the season was a success, with figures averaging around 20 million viewers an episode. This made it the year's highest-rated Fox program as well as the highest rated season of ''The X-Files'' to air. Critical reception from television critics was generally positive.

{{see also|Mythology of The X-Files}}
The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s.  At the end of [[The X-Files (season 4)|fourth season]], Scully is dying of cancer. Mulder is convinced that her condition is a result of her earlier abduction, and is prepared to make a deal with the [[Syndicate (The X-Files)|Syndicate]] to find a cure. While being pursued by an assassin responsible for a hoax alien corpse discovered on a mountaintop, Mulder fakes his own suicide, mutilating the assassin's face to provide a decoy body.<ref name="gethsemane">{{cite episode| episodelink=Gethsemane (The X-Files) | title=Gethsemane | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[R.W.

==Production==
===Writing===
Due to the pending release of [[The X-Files (film)|''The X-Files'' feature film]], this was the first season where the course of the season was planned in advance, as it had to set up for the film.<ref name="TheTruthBehind">{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]], et al |date=1998 |title=The Truth Behind Season 5 |medium= DVD |location = ''The X-Files: The Complete Fifth Season''|publisher=Fox Home Entertainment}}</ref> Originally, the season was supposed to be the show's last.<ref name="bigbook2">Hurwitz and Knowles (2008), p. 117</ref> In this manner, the finale was originally supposed to have segued the television series into a movie franchise. David Duchovny explained, "we were saying, 'Okay, we're going to do five. We'll get out of here at five.' And then five came around, and no one was going anywhere."<ref name="comp"/> The series proved to be so lucrative for Fox that two additional seasons were ordered. Thus, the season was created in a way to segue into the 1998 film, as well as the [[The X-Files (season 6)|sixth season]] premiere, "[[The Beginning (The X-Files)|The Beginning]]".<ref name="bigbook3">Hurwitz and Knowles (2008), p. 139</ref>

===Filming===
[[File:Downtown Vancouver Sunset.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The season was the last to be filmed in [[Vancouver, Canada]].]]
Due to the necessity of filming reshoots for the upcoming movie, both Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny are absent in places throughout the season. For instance, the episodes "[[Unusual Suspects]]" and "[[Travelers (The X-Files)|Travelers]]"<U+2014>both of which being [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] episodes<U+2014>do not feature Anderson's character Dana Scully at all.<ref name=huwitz119>Hurwitz and Knowles (2008), p. 119</ref> In fact, the former was written entirely as a stop-gap episode when the show's producers were forced to start production of the fifth season in the last week of August in Vancouver, but still needed series stars Duchovny and Anderson]] for the filming of ''[[The X-Files]]'' movie in Los Angeles. The producers decided to create an episode dedicated to The Lone Gunmen, and writing duties were assigned to [[Vince Gilligan]].<ref name="unusual">Meisler (1999), p. 24</ref> Other episode, like "Chinga" and "[[Christmas Carol (The X-Files)|Christmas Carol]]" feature minimal appearances by Duchovny's character Fox Mulder.

The season's fifth episode, "[[The Post-Modern Prometheus]]", written and directed by Carter, was filmed entirely in black-and-white<U+2014>in homage to [[James Whale]]'s 1931 film version of ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''.<ref name=Meisler85>Meisler (1999), pp. 84<U+2013>85</ref> The director of photography, Joel Ransom, had to spend longer than usual lighting each scene because of the [[grayscale]]. The stormy skies in the episode, added to emulate the atmosphere of old ''Frankenstein'' movies, were a [[visual effects|visual effect]]. Carter also used a [[wide-angle lens|wide-angle]] camera lens throughout the episode, which forced the actors to act directly to the camera, rather than to each other. According to Carter, it also enabled him to give scenes in the episode a more surreal staging than was usual for the show.<ref name=commentary>{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]] |date=2005 |title=Audio Commentary for "The Post-Modern Prometheus" |medium= DVD |location=''The X-Files: The Complete Fifth Season'' |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>

This season finale, "[[The End (The X-Files)|The End]]", was the last episode of the series to be filmed in [[Vancouver, Canada]] prior to production moving to [[Los Angeles, California]], although the second film in the franchise, ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]'', released in 2008, was once more filmed in Vancouver. The move was influenced in part by Duchovny, who after five years of filming wanted to be closer to his wife.<ref name="comp">Hurwitz and Knowles (2008), pp. 131<U+2013>133</ref> The audience at the chess match was made up of local fans as a "thank you" to the city for hosting the production during its first five years. The chess match was filmed at [[Rogers Arena]]<U+2014> then known as GM Place<U+2014>the home of the [[Vancouver Canucks]] as well as the [[Vancouver Grizzlies]] at the time. While the producers expected five thousand people to show up, twelve thousand appeared.<ref name="offprod"/> Instructions were given to the crowd by director [[R. W. Goodwin]] using giant video screens attached to the scoreboard. During breaks between shooting concession stands, music and videos were made available to the attendees. Actors Duchovny and Anderson also answered questions for the audience and over [[US dollar|$]]20,000 worth of equipment was raffled off. Series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] directed the second unit filming for the episode in order to be with the show's Canadian crew members.<ref name="offprod">Meisler (1999), p. 281</ref>
