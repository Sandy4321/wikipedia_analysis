'''Edward Wright''' ([[baptism|baptised]] [[8 October]] [[1561]]; died November 1615) was an [[England|English]] [[mathematician]] and [[cartographer]] noted for his book ''Certaine Errors in Navigation'' (1599; 2nd ed., 1610), which for the first time explained the mathematical basis of the [[Mercator projection]], and set out a reference table giving the linear scale multiplication factor as a function of [[latitude]], calculated for each [[minute of arc]] up to a latitude of 75<U+00B0>. This was the essential step needed to make practical both the making and the navigational use of Mercator charts.

Wright was educated at the [[University of Cambridge]], and was subsequently a [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge, and other Colleges|fellow]] of [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius College]] between 1587 and 1596. In 1589 the College granted him leave after [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] requested that he carry out [[navigation]]al studies with a raiding expedition organised by the [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland|Earl of Cumberland]] to the [[Azores]] to capture Spanish [[galleon]]s. The expedition's route was the subject of the first map to be prepared according to Wright's projection, which was published in ''Certaine Errors'' in 1599. The same year, Wright created and published the first world map produced in England and the first to use the Mercator projection since [[Gerardus Mercator]]'s original 1569 map.

In the early 1600s Wright was appointed as [[Surveying|surveyor]] to the [[New River (England)|New River]] project, which successfully directed the course of a new man-made channel to bring clean water from [[Ware]], [[Hertfordshire]], to [[Islington]], London. Around this time, Wright also lectured mathematics to [[British Merchant Navy|merchant seamen]], and from 1608 or 1609 was mathematics tutor to the son of [[James I of England|James I]], the [[heir apparent]] [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]], until the latter's untimely death at the age of 18 in 1612. A skilled designer of mathematical instruments, Wright made models of an [[astrolabe]] and a [[pantograph]], and a type of [[armillary sphere]] for Prince Henry. In the 1610 edition of ''Certaine Errors'' he described inventions such as the "sea-ring" that enabled mariners to determine the [[Magnetic declination|magnetic variation]] of the [[compass]], the sun's altitude and the time of day in any place if the latitude was known; and a device for finding latitude when one was not on the [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] using the height of the [[North Star|pole star]].

Apart from a number of other books and pamphlets, Wright translated [[John Napier]]'s pioneering 1614 work which introduced the idea of [[logarithm]]s from [[Latin]] into English. This was published after Wright's death as ''A Description of the Admirable Table of Logarithmes'' (1616). Wright's work influenced, among other persons, Dutch astronomer and mathematician [[Willebrord Snellius]]; [[Metius|Adriaan Metius]], the geometer and astronomer from Holland; and the English mathematician [[Richard Norwood]], who calculated the length of a [[Degree (angle)|degree]] on a [[great circle]] of the earth using a method proposed by Wright.

Wright was conferred a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A.) in 1580<U+2013>1581. He remained a scholar at Caius, receiving his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] (M.A.) there in 1584, and holding a [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge, and other Colleges|fellowship]] between 1587 and 1596.<ref>{{citation|author=[[John Venn]], comp.|title=Biographical History of Gonville and Caius College, 1349<U+2013>1897: Containing a List of All Known Members of the College|location=Cambridge|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1897|volume=1|pages=88<U+2013>89}}.</ref> At Cambridge, he was a close friend of [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Robert Devereux]], later the Second [[Earl of Essex]], and met him to discuss his studies even in the weeks before Devereux's rebellion against [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1600<U+2013>1601.

==Foreign expedition==

In 1589, two years after being appointed to his fellowship, Wright was requested by Elizabeth I to carry out [[navigation]]al studies with a raiding expedition organised by the [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland|Earl of Cumberland]] to the [[Azores]] to capture Spanish [[galleon]]s. The Queen effectively ordered Caius to grant him leave of absence for this purpose, although the College expressed this more diplomatically by granting him a [[sabbatical]] "by Royal mandate".<ref name="Caius Engineer">{{citation|author=Derek Ingram|contribution=The First Caian Engineer and the First Caian Pirate|url=http://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/students/study/engineering/engineer01/cepirate.htm|journal=The Caius Engineer|volume=13|issue=1|date=[[Michaelmas term]] 2001|accessdate=2008-05-02}}.</ref> Wright participated in the confiscation of "lawful" [[Prize (law)|prizes]] from the French, Portuguese and Spanish <U+2013> Derek Ingram, a life fellow of Caius, has called him "the only Fellow of Caius ever to be granted sabbatical leave in order to engage in piracy".<ref name="Caius Engineer"/> Wright sailed with Cumberland in the ''Victory'' from [[Plymouth]] on [[8 June]] [[1589]]; they returned to [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] on [[27 December]] of the same year.<ref name="P&M 61"/> An account of the expedition is appended to Wright's work ''Certaine Errors of Navigation'' (1599), and while it refers to Wright in the third person it is believed to have been written by him.<ref name="ODNB"/>

In Wright's account of the Azores expedition, he listed as one of the expedition's members a "Captaine ''Edwarde Carelesse, alias Wright'', who in S. Frauncis Drakes ''West-Indian'' voiage was Captaine of the ''Hope''". In another work, ''The Haven-finding Art'' (1599) (see [[#Navigation and cartography|below]]), Wright stated that "the time of my first employment at sea" was "now more than tenne yeares since".<ref name="P&M 61"/> The ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' asserts that during the expedition Wright called himself "Captain Edward Carelesse", and that he was also the [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] of the ''Hope'' in Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s voyage of 1585<U+2013>1586 to the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], which evacuated Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]'s [[Colony of Virginia]]. One of the colonists was the mathematician [[Thomas Harriot]], and if the ''Dictionary'' is correct it is probable that on the return journey to England Wright and Harriot became acquainted and discussed navigational mathematics.<ref name="ODNB"/> However, in a 1939 article, E.J.S. Parsons and W.F. Morris note that in Capt. Walter Bigges and Lt. Crofts' book ''A Summarie and True Discourse of Sir Frances Drakes West Indian Voyage'' (1589),<ref>{{citation|author=Walter Bigges|author2=Lieutenant Crofts|author3=Thomas Cates, ed.|title=A Summarie and True Discourse of Sir Francis Drakes VVest Indian Voyage wherein were Taken, the Townes of Saint Iago, Sancto Domingo, Cartagena & Saint Augustine: With Geographicall Mappes exactly Describing each of the Townes with their Scituations, and the Manner of the Armies Approching to the Winning of them.

[b]y Richard Field, dwelling in the Blacke-Friars by Ludgate|year=1589}}.</ref> Edward Careless was referred to as the commander of the ''Hope'', but Wright was not mentioned. Further, while Wright spoke several times of his participation in the Azores expedition, he never alluded to any other voyage. Although the reference to his "first employment" in ''The Haven-finding Art'' suggests an earlier venture, there is no evidence that he went to the West Indies. Gonville and Caius College holds no records showing that Wright was granted leave before 1589.<ref name="P&M 61"/>

There is nothing to suggest that Wright ever went to sea again after his expedition with the Earl of Cumberland.<ref name="ODNB"/>

==Mathematician and cartographer==
===Navigation and cartography===
Wright resumed his Cambridge fellowship upon returning from the Azores in 1589,<ref name="Lewi"/> but it appears that he soon moved to London for he was there with Christopher Heydon making observations of the sun between 1594 and 1597, and on [[8 August]] [[1595]] Wright married Ursula Warren (died 1625) at the [[parish church]] of [[St Michael, Cornhill|St. Michael, Cornhill]], in the [[City of London]].<ref>Parish register, London, St. Michael Cornhill, [[8 August]] [[1595]], GL [marriage]: see Apt, "Wright, Edward", ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''.</ref> They had a son, Samuel (1596<U+2013>1616), who was himself admitted as a sizar<ref name="ODNB"/> at Caius on [[7 July]] [[1612]].<ref name="P&M 71">Parsons & Morris, p. 71.</ref> The St. Michael parish register also contains references to other children of Wright, all of whom died before 1617.<ref name="P&M 71"/> Wright resigned his fellowship in 1596.<ref name="ODNB"/>

Wright helped the mathematician and globe maker [[Emery Molyneux]] to plot coastlines on his terrestrial globe, and translated some of the legends into [[Latin]].<ref>{{citation|author=Susan M. Maxwell|contribution=Molyneux, Emery (''d.'' 1598)|title=[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|edition=Online|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=September 2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/50911|accessdate=2008-01-28}}.</ref> Molyneux's terrestrial and celestial globes, the first to be manufactured in England, were published in late 1592 or early 1593, and Wright explained their use in his 1599 work ''Certaine Errors in Navigation''.

[[Image:Usgs map mercator.svg|thumb|413px|Wright explained the [[Mercator projection]] with the analogy of a sphere being inflated like a [[wikt:bladder|bladder]] inside a hollow [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]].<ref>Parsons & Morris, p. 63; see also {{citation|author=[[Marie Boas Hall]]|chapter=The Uses of Mathematics &#91;ch. 7&#93;|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TnW2YIrn2pEC&pg=PA208&lpg=PA208&ots=qbJClV2I5d&sig=f5eH6V2IiSV1XiaZwZLloTJi6zg&hl=en|title=The Scientific Renaissance 1450<U+2013>1630|location=New York, N.Y.; London|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]; [[Constable & Robinson|Constable]]|year=1994|pages=197<U+2013>237 at 208|isbn=0486281159 (pbk.)}}.</ref> The sphere is expanded uniformly, so that the [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]]s lengthen in the same proportion as the [[Circle of latitude|parallel]]s, until each point of the expanding spherical surface comes into contact with the inside of the cylinder. This process [[Conformal map|preserves the local shape and angles]] of features on the surface of the original globe, at the expense of parts of the globe with different latitudes becoming expanded by different amounts.<ref>It is a common misconception that the Mercator projection is mathematically the same as projecting rays of light through the globe onto the cylinder from a source at the centre: {{citation|author=Eli Maor|chapter=A Mapmaker's Paradise &#91;ch. 13&#93;|url=http://press.princeton.edu/books/maor/chapter_13.pdf|title=Trigonometric Delights|location=Princeton, N.J.; Chichester|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1998|page=165 at 176|isbn=0691057540}}.</ref>  The cylinder is then opened out into a two-dimensional [[rectangle]]. The projection is a boon to navigators as [[rhumb line]]s are depicted as straight lines.]]

The most significant aspect of the book was Wright's method for dividing the [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]], an explanation of how he had constructed a table for the division, and the uses of this information for navigation. Essentially, the problem that occupied Wright was how to accurately depict a globe on a two-dimensional map according to the projection used by [[Gerardus Mercator]] in his map of 1569. Mercator's projection was advantageous for nautical purposes as it represented lines of constant [[Bearing (navigation)|true bearing]] or [[Course (navigation)|true course]], known as loxodromes or [[rhumb line]]s, as straight lines. However, Mercator had not explained his method.<ref name="Monmonier">{{citation|author=[[Mark Monmonier|Mark [Stephen] Monmonier]]|chapter=The Wright Approach &#91;ch. 5&#93;|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nvwu4Ba_Qp0C&pg=PA63&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=0_0&sig=iMF8eEcNW1HsNQH8NTq-2DGGuVs#PPA70,M1|title=Rhumb Lines and Map Wars: A Social History of the Mercator Projection|location=Chicago, Ill.|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=2004|pages=65<U+2013>67|isbn=0-226-53431-6 (hbk.)}}.</ref>

On a globe, [[circles of latitude]] (also known as parallels) get smaller as they move away from the [[Equator]] towards the [[North Pole|North]] or [[South Pole]]. Thus, in the Mercator projection, when a globe is "unwrapped" on to a rectangular map, the parallels need to be stretched to the length of the Equator. In addition, parallels are further apart as they approach the [[Geographical pole|poles]]. Wright compiled a table with three columns. The first two columns contained the [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] and [[Minute of arc|minutes]] of [[latitude]]s for parallels spaced 10&nbsp;minutes apart on a sphere, while the third column had the parallel's projected distance from the Equator. Any cartographer or navigator could therefore lay out a Mercator grid for himself by consulting the table.<ref>Monmonier, ''Rhumb Lines and Map Wars'', pp. 63<U+2013>64.</ref> Wright explained:

{{quote|I first thought of correcting so many gross errors ... in the sea chart, by increasing the distances of the parallels, from the [[Equator|equinoctial]] towards the poles, in such sort, that at every point of latitude in the chart, a part of the meridian might have the same proportion to the like part of the parallel, that it has in the globe.<ref>Quoted in Lewi, "Mercator, Wright and Mapmaking", p. 25 (the reference in Lewi to Parsons & Morris, p. 65, is incorrect).</ref>}}

[[Image:JodocusHondius-ChristianKnightMap-1597.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jodocus Hondius|Hondius]] made use of Wright's calculations without acknowledgment in his "Christian Knight Map" of 1597, prompting Wright to publish ''Certaine Errors in Navigation'' in 1599.]]

While the first edition of ''Certaine Errors'' contained an abridged table six pages in length, in the second edition which appeared in 1610 Wright published a full table across 23 pages with figures for parallels at one-minute intervals. The table is remarkably accurate <U+2013> American geography professor [[Mark Monmonier]] wrote a computer program to replicate Wright's calculations, and determined that for a Mercator map of the world {{convert|3|ft|m}} wide, the greatest discrepancy between Wright's table and the program was only {{convert|0.00039|in|mm}} on the map.<ref>Monmonier, ''Rhumb Lines and Map Wars'', p. 68.</ref> In the second edition Wright also incorporated various improvements, including proposals for determining the magnitude of the Earth and reckoning common linear measurements as a proportion of a degree on the Earth's surface "that they might not depend on the uncertain length of a barley-corn"; a correction of [[Parallax error|errors arising from the eccentricity of the eye]] when making observations using the [[Jacob's staff|cross-staff]]; amendments in tables of [[declination]]s and the positions of the sun and the stars, which were based on observations he had made together with Christopher Heydon using a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]; and a large table of the [[Magnetic declination|variation of the compass]] as observed in different parts of the world, to show that it is not caused by any [[Geomagnetic Pole|magnetic pole]]. He also incorporated a translation of Rodrigo Zamorano's ''Compendio de la Arte de Navegar'' (''Compendium of the Art of Navigation'', Seville, 1581; 2nd ed., 1588).<ref name="Hutton">{{citation|author=[[Charles Hutton]]|contribution=Wright (Edward)|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lsdJAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA619&lpg=PA61#PPA619,M1|title=A Philosophical and Mathematical Dictionary|location=London|publisher=Printed for the author by F.C. and J.

Wright was prompted to publish the book after two incidents of his text, which had been prepared some years earlier, being used without attribution. He had allowed his table of meridional parts to be published by Thomas Blundeville in his ''Exercises'' (1594)<ref>{{citation|author=Thomas Blundeville|title=M.

However, an experienced navigator, believed to be Abraham Kendall, borrowed a draft of Wright's manuscript and, unknown to him, made a copy of it which he took on Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s 1595 expedition to the West Indies. In 1596 Kendall died at sea. The copy of Wright's work in his possession was brought back to London and wrongly believed to be by Kendall, until the Earl of Cumberland passed it to Wright and he recognised it as his work.<ref>Parsons & Morris, p. 62; Monmonier, ''Rhumb Lines and Map Wars'', p. 70.</ref> Also around this time, the Dutch cartographer [[Jodocus Hondius]] borrowed Wright's draft manuscript for a short time after promising not to publish its contents without his permission. However, Hondius then employed Wright's calculations without acknowledging him for several regional maps and in his world map published in Amsterdam in 1597. This map is often referred to as the "Christian Knight Map" for its engraving of a Christian knight battling sin, the flesh and the Devil. Although Hondius sent Wright a letter containing a faint apology, Wright condemned Hondius's deceit and greed in the preface to ''Certaine Errors''.<ref>Monmonier, ''Rhumb Lines and Map Wars'', pp. 68<U+2013>70.</ref> He wryly commented: "But the way how this [Mercator projection] should be done, I learned neither of Mercator, nor of any man els.

Wright translated into English ''De Havenvinding'' (1599) by the [[Flanders|Flemish]] mathematician and engineer [[Simon Stevin]], which appeared in the same year as ''The Haven-Finding Art, or the Way to Find any Haven or Place at Sea, by the Latitude and Variation''. He also wrote the preface to physician and scientist [[William Gilbert]]'s great work ''[[De Magnete|De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure]]'' (''The Magnet, Magnetic Bodies, and the Great Magnet the Earth'', 1600),<ref>{{citation|author=[[William Gilbert]]|title=De Magnete, magneticisque corporibus, et de magno magnete tellure; Physiologia nova, plurimis & argumentis, & experimentis demonstrata [The Magnet, Magnetic Bodies, and the Great Magnet the Earth; New Natural Science, Demonstrated by Many Arguments and Experiments]|location=London|publisher=Excudebat Petrus Short|year=1600}} (Latin).</ref> in which Gilbert described his experiments which led to the conclusion that the [[Earth's magnetic field|Earth was magnetic]], and introduced the term ''electricus'' to describe the phenomenon of [[static electricity]] produced by rubbing [[amber]] (called ''<U+0113>lectrum'' in [[Classical Latin]], derived from ''<U+2019><U+03AE><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03BD>'' (''elektron'') in [[Ancient Greek]]).<ref>{{citation|contribution=electrum, ''n.''|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50073059|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED Online]]|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=March 2008|accessdate=2008-05-03}}.</ref> According to the mathematician and physician [[Mark Ridley (physician)|Mark Ridley]],<ref>{{citation|author=[[Mark Ridley (physician)|Mark Ridley]]|title=Magneticall Animadversions ... upon certaine Magneticall Advertisements lately Published, from Maister W.

Gilbert had invented a [[Dip circle|dip-compass]] and compiled a table recording the [[Magnetic dip|dip]] of the needle below the horizon. Wright believed that this device would prove to be extremely useful in determining latitude and, with the help of Blundeville and Briggs, wrote a small pamphlet called ''The Making, Description and Use of the Two Instruments for Sea-men to find out the Latitude ... First Invented by Dr. Gilbert''. It was published in 1602 in Blundeville's book ''The Theoriques of the Seuen Planets''.<ref>{{citation|author=Thomas Blundeville|author2=[[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]]|author3=Edward Wright|title=The Theoriques of the Seuen Planets shewing all their Diuerse Motions, and all other Accidents, called Passions, thereunto Belonging.

Wright also developed a reputation as a [[Surveying|surveyor]] on land. He prepared "a [[plat]] of part of the waye whereby a newe River may be brought from [[Uxbridge]] to [[St. James's|St. James]], [[Whitehall]], [[Westminster]][,]<!--A comma is missing at this point in the Parsons & Morris article.--> the [[Strand, London|Strand]], [[St Giles' Circus|St. Giles]], [[Holborn|Holbourne]] and London",<ref>[[British Museum]], [[Cotton library|Cotton manuscript]], [[Titus]] book viii, folio 318: see Parsons & Morris, p. 69.</ref> However, according to a 1615 paper in Latin in the annals of Gonville and Caius College, he was prevented from bringing this plan to fruition "by the tricks of others".<ref name="Hutton"/><ref name="P&M 70">Parsons & Morris, p. 70.</ref> Nonetheless, in the early 1600s he was appointed by Sir [[Hugh Myddelton]] as surveyor to the [[New River (England)|New River]] project, which successfully directed the course of a new man-made channel to bring clean water from Chadwell Spring at [[Ware]], [[Hertfordshire]],<ref name="Hutton"/> to [[Islington]], London. Although the distance in a straight line from Ware to London is only slightly more than {{convert|20|mi|km}}, the project required a high degree of surveying skill on Wright's part as it was necessary for the river to take a route of over 40&nbsp;miles following the {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} [[contour line]] on the west side of the [[River Lee (England)|Lee Valley]]. As the technology of the time did not extend to large pumps or pipes, the water flow had to depend on gravity through canals or [[aqueduct]]s over an average fall of 5.5&nbsp;inches a mile (approximately 8.7&nbsp;centimetres per kilometre).<ref name="Caius Engineer"/><ref name="Thames Water">{{citation|title=The story of the New River|url=http://www.thameswater.co.uk/waterinschools/newriver/story.html|publisher=[[Thames Water]]|accessdate=2008-05-01}}.</ref>

Work on the New River started in 1608 <U+2013> the date of a monument at Chadwell Spring <U+2013> but halted near [[Wormley]], [[Surrey]], in 1610. The stoppage has been attributed to factors such as Myddelton facing difficulties in raising funds, and landowners along the route opposing the acquisition of their lands on the ground that the river would turn their meadows into "bogs and quagmires".<ref name="Thames Water"/> Although the landowners petitioned [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] they did not succeed in having the legislation authorizing the project repealed prior to Parliament being dissolved in 1611; the work resumed later that year. The New River was officially opened on [[29 September]] [[1613]] by the [[Lord Mayor of the City of London|Lord Mayor of London]], Sir John Swinnerton, at the Round Pond, New River Head, in Islington. It still supplies the capital with water today.<ref name="Thames Water"/>

===Other mathematical work===
For some time Wright had urged that a navigation lectureship be instituted for [[British Merchant Navy|merchant seamen]], and he persuaded Admiral Sir [[William Monson]], who had been on Cumberland's Azores expedition of 1589, to encourage a [[stipend]] to be paid for this. At the beginning of the 17th century, Wright succeeded Thomas Hood as a mathematics lecturer under the patronage of the wealthy merchants Sir Thomas Smyth and Sir John Wolstenholme; the lectures were held in Smyth's house in Philpot Lane.<ref>{{citation|author=[[Clements Markham|Clements R[obert] Markham]]|title=Commemoration of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth: Address by the President, Sir Clements R.

Wright was a skilled designer of mathematical instruments. According to the 1615 Caius annals, "[h]e was excellent both in contrivance and execution, nor was he inferior to the most ingenious mechanic in the making of instruments, either of brass or any other matter".<ref name="Hutton"/> For Prince Henry, he made models of an [[astrolabe]] and a [[pantograph]],<ref name="P&M 70"/> and created or arranged to be created out of wood a form of [[armillary sphere]] which replicated the motions of the [[celestial sphere]], the circular motions of the sun and moon, and the places and possibilities of them [[Eclipse|eclipsing]] each other. The sphere was designed for a motion of 17,100&nbsp;years, if the machine should last that long.<ref name="Hutton"/> In 1613 Wright published ''The Description and Use of the Sph<U+00E6>re'', which described the use of this device.<ref name="ODNB"/> The sphere was lost during the [[English Civil War]], but found in 1646 in the [[Tower of London]] by the mathematician and surveyor Sir [[Jonas Moore]], who was later appointed Surveyor General of the [[Ordnance Survey|Ordnance Office]] and became a patron and the principal driving force behind the establishment of the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory at Greenwich]]. Moore asked the King to let him have it, restored the instrument at his own expense and deposited it at his own house "in the Tower".<ref name="Hutton"/><ref>John Aubrey's manuscripts, later published as {{citation|author=[[John Aubrey]]|editor=Andrew Clark|title=&#39;Brief Lives,&#39; chiefly of Contemporaries, set down ... between the Years 1669 & 1696.

[[Image:John Napier.JPG|thumb|upright|The Scotsman [[John Napier]] (1550<U+2013>1617), the inventor of [[logarithm]]s, depicted in an engraving by Samuel Freeman (1773<U+2013>1857) based on a 1616 painting at the [[University of Edinburgh]]]]

In 1614 Wright published a small book called ''A Short Treatise of Dialling Shewing, the Making of All Sorts of Sun-dials'', but he was mainly preoccupied with [[John Napier]]'s ''Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio'' (''Description of the Wonderful Rule of Logarithms''),<ref>{{citation|author=[[John Napier]]|title=Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis descriptio; ejusque usus, in utraque trigonometria, ut etiam in omni logistica mathematica, amplissimi, facillimi, & expeditissimi explicatio [Description of the Wonderful Rule of Logarithms: Its use in Trigonometry, as well as in all types of Mathematical Calculations, Explained Broadly, Easily and in an Unemcumbered Manner]|location=Edinburgh|publisher=Ex officina Andre<U+00E6> Hart|year=1614}} ([[Latin]]).</ref> which introduced the idea of [[logarithm]]s. Wright at once saw the value of logarithms as an aid to navigation, and lost no time in preparing a translation which he submitted to Napier himself. The preface to Wright's edition consists of a translation of the preface to the ''Descriptio'', together with the addition of the following sentences written by Napier himself:

{{quote|But now some of our countreymen in this Island well affected to these studies, and the more publique good, procured a most learned Mathematician to translate the same into our vulgar English tongue, who after he had finished it, sent the Coppy of it to me, to bee seene and considered on by myselfe.

While working on the translation, Wright died in late November 1615 and was buried on [[2 December]] [[1615]] at [[St Dionis Backchurch|St. Dionis Backchurch]] in the City of London.<ref>Parish register, London, St. Dionis Backchurch, [[2 December]] [[1615]], GL [burial]: see Apt, "Wright, Edward", ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''.</ref> The Caius annals noted that although he "was rich in fame, and in the promises of the great, yet he died poor, to the scandal of an ungrateful age".<ref name="Hutton"/> Wright's translation of Napier, which incorporated tables that Wright had supplemented and further information by Henry Briggs, was completed by Wright's son Samuel and arranged to be printed by Briggs.<ref name="ODNB"/> It appeared posthumously as ''A Description of the Admirable Table of Logarithmes'' in 1616, and in it Wright was lauded in verse as "[t]hat famous, learned, Errors true Corrector, / England's great Pilot, Mariners Director".<ref>Lewi, "Mercator, Wright and Mapmaking", p. 31.</ref>

According to Parsons and Morris, the use of Wright's publications by later mathematicians is the "greatest tribute to his life's work".<ref name="P&M 70"/> Wright's work was relied on by Dutch astronomer and mathematician [[Willebrord Snellius]], noted for the law of [[refraction]] now known as [[Snell's law]], for his navigation treatise ''Tiphys Batavus'' (''Batavian Tiphys'', 1624);<ref>{{citation|author=[[Willebrord Snellius]]|title=Willebrordi Snellii <U+00E0> Royen Tiphys Batavus, sive histiodromice, de navium cursibus et re navali.
