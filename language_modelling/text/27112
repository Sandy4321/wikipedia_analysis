The '''Washington Capitals''' are a professional [[ice hockey]] team based in [[Washington, D.C.]]. They are members of the [[Southeast Division (NHL)|Southeast Division]] of the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).

==Early history==
[[Image:WashingtonCapitals1980s.png|left|thumb|The original Capitals logo, used from 1974-95.]]
Along with the [[Kansas City Scouts]], the Capitals joined the National Hockey League as an [[expansion team]] for the [[1974-75 NHL season|1974-75]] season.  The team was owned by [[Abe Pollin]], owner of the [[NBA]]'s [[Washington Wizards]].  Pollin had built the Capital Centre in suburban [[Landover, Maryland]], to house both the Wizards (who formerly played in [[Baltimore]]) and the Capitals.  His first act as owner was to hire [[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Milt Schmidt]] as general manager.  

With a combined 30 teams between the NHL and the rival [[World Hockey Association]], the Capitals had few players with professional experience and were at a disadvantage against the long-standing teams that were stocked with more experienced players.  Like the other three teams who joined the league during the WHA era &ndash; the Scouts, [[Calgary Flames|Atlanta Flames]] and [[New York Islanders]] &ndash; the Capitals did not factor the arrival of the WHA into their plans.  

The Capitals' inaugural season was dreadful, even by expansion standards.  They finished 8-67-5, far and away the worst record in the league.  Their 21 points were half that of their expansion brethren, the Scouts.  They won only eight games, the fewest ever by a team playing at least 70 games.  Their .131 winning percentage is still the worst in NHL history.  They also set records for most road losses (39 out of 40), most consecutive road losses (37) and most consecutive losses (17), most of which have now been broken.  Schmidt himself had to take over the coaching reins late in the season.

In [[1975-76 NHL season|1975-76]], Washington went 25 straight games without a win and allowed 394 goals en route to another horrendous record &ndash; 11-59-10 (32 points).  For the rest of the 1970s and early 1980s, the Capitals alternated between dreadful seasons and finishing only a few points out of the playoffs.  In [[1979-80 NHL season|1980]] and [[1980-81 NHL season|1981]], for instance, they were in playoff contention until the last day of the season.  By the summer of [[1981-82 NHL season|1982]], there was serious talk of the team moving out of the U.S. capital, and a "Save the Caps" campaign was underway. Then two significant events took place to solve the problem.

==Playoffs==
First, the team hired [[David Poile]] as General Manager. Second, as his first move, Poile pulled off one of the biggest trades in franchise history on [[September 9]], [[1982]], when he dealt longtime regulars [[Ryan Walter]] and [[Rick Green (ice hockey)|Rick Green]] to the [[Montreal Canadiens]] for [[Rod Langway]], [[Brian Engblom]], [[Doug Jarvis]], and [[Craig Laughlin]]. This move turned the franchise around, as Langway's solid defense helped the team to dramatically reduce its goals-against, and the explosive goal-scoring of [[Dennis Maruk]], [[Mike Gartner]], and [[Bobby Carpenter]] fueled the offensive attack.  The result was a 29-point jump, a third-place finish in the powerful [[Patrick Division]], and the team's first playoff appearance in [[1982-83 NHL season|1983]]. Although they were swept by the three-time-defending [[Stanley Cup]] Champion [[New York Islanders]], the Caps' dramatic turnaround ended any talk of the club leaving Washington.

The Capitals would make the playoffs for each of the next 14 years in a row.  They became known for starting slow before catching fire in January and February.  However, regular-season success did not carry into the playoffs.  Despite a continuous march of stars like Gartner, Carpenter, Langway, [[Bengt-Ake Gustafsson]], [[Mike Ridley]], [[Dave Christian]], [[Dino Ciccarelli]], [[Larry Murphy]], and [[Kevin Hatcher]], Washington was knocked out in either the first or second round eight years in a row.  In [[1985-86 NHL season|1985-86]], for instance, the Caps finished with 107 points (a franchise record that still stands today) and won 50 games for the only time in franchise history, good enough for the fourth-best record in the league.  However, they were bounced out of the playoffs in the second round by the [[New York Rangers]]. 

[[1986-87 NHL season|The next season]] brought even more heartbreak, with a loss to the Islanders in the Patrick Division Semifinal.  This series was capped off by the classic [[Easter Epic]] game, which ended at 1:56 am on Easter Sunday 1987.  The Capitals had thoroughly dominated most of the game, outshooting the Islanders 75-52, but lost in overtime when goaltender [[Bob Mason]] was beaten on a [[Pat LaFontaine]] shot from the blue line.  The Capitals finally made the Wales Conference Finals in [[1989-90 NHL season|1990]], but went down in a four-game sweep at the hands of the first-place [[Boston Bruins]]. Gartner had been traded to the [[Minnesota North Stars]] in [[1988-89 NHL season|1989]].

==Lost chances==
By the mid-[[1990s]], the [[Stanley Cup]] seemed to elude the Capitals. Despite having rising stars in right-winger [[Peter Bondra]], defenseman [[Sergei Gonchar]], and center/left-wing [[Jo<U+00E9> Juneau|Joe Juneau]], the team's core players were mostly aging. 

The Capitals were favourites during the [[1992-93 NHL season|1993]] playoff series with the [[New York Islanders]] but they were upset in six games. That series was most remembered when center and [[Enforcer (hockey)|enforcer]] [[Dale Hunter]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xte-Vtxg-m8 checked] the Isles' [[Pierre Turgeon]] from behind in Game 6 ''after'' Turgeon scored a goal. Turgeon fell awkwardly onto the ice and suffered a separated shoulder.  Turgeon would miss the Isles' entire second round series against the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] as a result.  Hunter's post-goal check earned him a suspension for the first 21 games of the [[1993-94 NHL season|next season]] -- at the time the longest suspension for an on-ice incident in NHL history.  Hunter had otherwise been the team's best player in that series with eight postseason goals.

==Eastern Conference champions==
Then in [[1997-98 NHL season|1998]], Peter Bondra's 52 goals led the team, veterans Hunter, Juneau and [[Adam Oates]] returned to old form, and [[Olaf Kolzig]] had a solid .920 save percentage as the Caps got past the [[Boston Bruins]], [[Ottawa Senators]], and [[Buffalo Sabres]] (the latter on a dramatic overtime win in game six on a goal by Joe Juneau) en route to the team's first (and to date, only) Stanley Cup finals appearance. The Capitals won six overtime games, three in each of their series against the Bruins and Sabres. However, the team was no match for the defending champs, the [[Detroit Red Wings]], who won in a four-game sweep.  

That same season, Oates, [[Phil Housley]], and [[Dale Hunter]], all scored their 1,000th career point, the only time in NHL history that one team had 3 different players reach that same milestone in a single season.

==Disappointments and rebuilding==
[[Image:WashingtonCapitals1990s.png|right|thumb|200px|Capitals logo 1996-2007]]
In [[1998-99 NHL season|1999]], the Capitals missed the playoffs due to numerous injuries, one of the highest in the league that season. They went on to win back-to-back Southeast Division titles in 2000 and 2001, yet both years lost in the first round to the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]. After the 2000-01 season, [[Adam Oates]] demanded a trade but management refused and stripped him of his team captaincy. 

In the summer of [[2001 in sports|2001]], the Capitals landing five-time [[Art Ross Trophy]] winner [[Jaromir Jagr]], one of the best players in the NHL in the [[1990s]], by trading three young prospects to the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]. Jagr was signed to the largest contract ever in NHL history - $77 million over 7 years at an average salary of $11 million per year, with an option for an eighth year. That's over $134,000 ''per game''. However, Jagr did not live up to expectations, as the Capitals failed to defend their division title and missed the playoffs in [[2002 in sports|2002]]. 

In the summer of 2002, the Caps made even more roster changes, including the signing the highly regarded [[Robert Lang (hockey player)|Robert Lang]] as a free agent, a linemate of Jagr's from Pittsburgh. The Capitals were back in the playoffs [[2002-03 NHL season|2003]], but disappointed fans again by losing in six games to the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] after starting off with a two-game lead in the best-of-seven first-round series. The series is well-remembered for the three-overtime Game 6 at the then-[[Verizon Center|MCI Center]], the longest game in the building's history, which was eventually decided by a power play goal as a result of [[Jason Doig]] skating on the ice too early and warranting a too-many-men-on-the-ice penalty.

In the 2003-2004 season, the Caps unloaded a lot of their high-priced talent in order to save money &mdash; not just a cost-cutting spree, but also an acknowledgment that their attempt to build a contender with high-priced veteran talent had failed. Jagr had failed to finish among the league's top scorers or make the postseason All-Star Team during his time with the Capitals. They tried to trade Jagr, but as only one year was left on the existing [[collective bargaining|Collective Bargaining Agreement]] before it expired, few teams were willing to risk $11 million on an underperforming player. In 2004, Jagr was finally sent to the [[New York Rangers]] for [[Anson Carter]] and an agreement that Washington would pay approximately four million dollars per year of Jagr's salary, with Jagr himself agreeing to defer (with interest) $1 million per year for the remainder of his contract to allow the trade to go ahead. This was quickly followed by Bondra going to the [[Ottawa Senators]]. Not long after, [[Robert Lang]] was sent to [[Detroit Red Wings|Detroit]] and Gonchar to the [[Boston Bruins|Bruins]]. The Robert Lang trade marked the first time in the history of the [[National Hockey League]] that the league's leading scorer was traded in the middle of the season. The Capitals ended the year 23-46-10-6, tied for the second worst record, along with the [[Chicago Blackhawks]].

[[Image:WashingtonCapitals2000s.png||thumb|right|150px|Capitals' former home logo; two hockey sticks crossed behind the image of the [[United States Capitol]], with stars flanking it, a hockey puck at the front, and the team's name emblazoned across the Capitol.]]
In the [[2004 NHL Entry Draft]], the Capitals won the Draft Lottery, and selected [[Alexander Ovechkin]] first overall. During the [[2004-05 NHL lockout|NHL labor dispute of 2004-05]], which cost the NHL its entire season, Ovechkin stayed in Russia, playing for [[Moscow Dynamo]]. Several other Capitals played part or all of the lost season in [[Europe]], including [[Olaf K<U+00F6>lzig|Olaf Kolzig]], [[Brendan Witt]], and [[Jeff Halpern]]. The Capitals' 2005 off-season consisted of making D.C.-area native Halpern the team's captain, signing [[Andrew Cassels]], [[Ben Clymer]], [[Mathieu Biron]] and [[Jamie Heward]], and acquiring [[Chris Clark (hockey player)|Chris Clark]] and [[Jeff Friesen]] via trade.

==Post-lockout==
The Capitals finished the 2005-2006 NHL season in the cellar of the Southeastern Division again, with a 29-41-12 campaign, having 12 more points then the 2003-04 Season, good for 27th out of the 30 NHL teams. Yet the team played close in every game, playing in 42 one-goal games, although losing 2/3 of those games. Ovechkin's rookie season exceeded the hype, as he led all 2005-06 NHL rookies in goals, points, power-play goals and shots. He finished third overall in the NHL in scoring and tied for third in goals; and his 425 shots not only led the league, but also set an NHL rookie record and was the fourth-highest total in NHL history. Ovechkin's rookie point total was the second-best in Washington Capitals history, and his goal total was tied for third in franchise history. Ovechkin won the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]], beating out Pittsburgh center [[Sidney Crosby]] and [[Calgary Flames]] defenseman [[Dion Phaneuf]]. Many longtime Capitals had career years, with [[Dainius Zubrus]] netting 57 points, Halpern having a career-best 33 assists, [[Matt Pettinger]] putting in a career-best 20-goal, 38-point effort and seven others on the relatively young team topping 20 points for the first time. Two notable landmarks were also hit by Capitals, as the team's longest tenured Capital, Olaf Kolzig, won his 250th game in goal and [[Andrew Cassels]] became the 204th player to play 1,000 games, although he did not finish out his season with the team. A notable first was that [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] area native [[Jeff Halpern]] was named captain of the hometown Capitals. At the 2006 trade deadline, March 8, Witt was traded to [[Nashville Predators|Nashville]].

===2006-2007 season===
In the 2006 offseason, Halpern left the Capitals to join the [[Dallas Stars]]; [[Chris Clark (hockey player)|Chris Clark]] became the Capitals' new captain. [[Richard Zedn<U+00ED>k|Richard Zednik]] returned to the Capitals in [[2006-07 NHL season|2006-07]] after a disappointing 16-goal, 14-assist season in 2005-06 with Montreal, but was later dealt at the trade deadline to the New York Islanders after a disappointing and injury plagued season; the Caps also signed former [[Philadelphia Flyers]] enforcer [[Donald Brashear]].

Yet the Capitals finished with the same point total (70) in 2006-2007 as they did the year before, although they won one less game. [[Alexander Ovechkin]] was the Capitals' lone representative in the All-Star game. The year was also notable for [[Alexander Semin]]'s breakout, who notched 38 goals in only his 2nd NHL season.

==2007 offseason==
[[Image:WashingtonCaps.PNG|left|thumb|The Capitals alternate logo, beginning in 2007. {{deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 29 July 2007}}]]
The Capitals unveiled new uniforms on [[June 22]], [[2007]] which coincided with the NHL Entry Draft and the new league-wide adaptation of the [[Reebok]]-designed uniform system for 2007-2008.  The change marks a return to the red, white, and blue color scheme originally used from 1974 to 1995.<ref>http://www.washingtoncaps.com/news/news.asp?story_id=4783</ref>  The new primary logo is reminiscent of the original Capitals' logo, complete with a hockey stick formed by the letter "t"; it also includes a new feature the original logo didn't have: 3 stars representing [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], and [[District of Columbia|DC]].<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/21/AR2007062102100.html "Back in Red, White and Blue, Caps Make a Colorful Statement"] ''Washington Post'' June 22, 2007</ref> These stars also appear on the [[flag of Washington, D.C.]].

The Capitals finally signed Swedish phenom [[Nicklas Backstrom]], the fourth overall pick in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft, to three-year entry-level contract. They also recently signed 19 year old Simeon Varlamov to a three-year entry-level contract. They then went on to fill needs at defense, by signing puck moving defenseman Tom Poti, right wing, by signing Viktor Kozlov, and center, by signing playmaker [[Michael Nylander]]. The moves have brought hope for the 07-08 season, that the Caps might finally make the playoffs again.

===Honored Members===
''Retired Numbers'': The Capitals have retired three numbers.  Defenseman [[Yvon Labre]]'s number '''7''' was retired in 1980, during the last season of the career of this original Capital.  In 1997, the Capitals retired the number '''5''' of defenseman [[Rod Langway]], and center [[Dale Hunter]]'s number '''32''' was raised in 2000.  The Capitals also honor the leaguewide retirement of [[Wayne Gretzky]]'s '''99'''.  

''Hall of Famers'': The Capitals have four former players in the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]].  Right wing [[Mike Gartner]] was the first to be inducted, in 2001, after a long NHL career that included ten years (1979-89) with the Caps.  A year later, defenseman [[Rod Langway]] (1982-93 with Washington) joined Gartner, and in 2004, defenseman [[Larry Murphy]] (1984-89) was selected.  In 2007, defenseman Scott Stevens became the fourth Washington Capital to be inducted to the Hall of Fame. In addition, Langway and former team owner [[Abe Pollin]] are honored in the Washington Hall of Stars, a series of banners honoring D.C. sports figures on the right-field wall at [[Robert F. Kennedy Stadium]].
