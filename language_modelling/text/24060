"'''Canada on Strike'''" is the fourth episode of the [[South Park (season 12)|twelfth season]] of the American [[cartoon series|animated series]] ''[[South Park]]'',<ref name="South Park Studios">{{cite web | title=Episode 1204 Press Release | publisher=South Park Studios | year=2008 | url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/news/3414 | accessdate=2008-03-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080403014038/http://www.southparkstudios.com/news/3414 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-03}}</ref> and the 171st episode of the series overall. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the [[United States]] on April 2, 2008. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]], and was rated [[TV-MA]] LV in the United States.

The nation of Canada, feeling disrespected by the rest of the world, goes on a general strike, demanding money, spurring the boys to raise money by creating a [[viral video]]. The episode, which is inspired by the [[2007<U+2013>2008 Writers Guild of America strike]], features appearances by the creators of a number of famous viral videos.

==Plot==
[[Mr. Mackey]] informs the students that it is Canada Appreciation Day. He plays a video in which [[Stephen Harper|Steven Aboutman]] (pronounced "Abootman"), President of the World Canadian Bureau (acronym: [[2007<U+2013>2008 Writers Guild of America strike|WGA]]),<ref name="IGN"/> asks the students to remember all of Canada's contributions to the world. When he asks, "When you think of Canada, what's the first thing that comes to mind?", to which [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] responds, "[[gay|Gayness]]!" Aboutman also asks, "What is it that makes Canada so important?" and [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] replies "Nothing!" All other students laugh and ridicule the Canadians (except for [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]], who is the only South Park Elementary student of Canadian descent). In Canada, Aboutman learns of the world's lackluster response to Canada Appreciation Day, and resolves to have the country go on strike, spurring the Canadians break out into a choreographed song and dance number. When Aboutman and his cohorts announce their strike to an assembly of world leaders, the other countries' delegates are confused as to what exactly Canada wants. Aboutman responds "more money", and when asked where this money should come from he exclaims "the Internet makes lots of money. Give us some of that money!" When the other delegates try to explain that they cannot give Canada money, Aboutman storms out and shouts that the strike will continue.

Meanwhile, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] is watching Ike stand outside his house, picketing. Kyle approaches the other boys with worries about his brother, but they are too busy watching ''[[Terrance and Phillip]]'' to care. Realizing that all the ''Terrance and Phillip'' episodes are reruns, they attempt to call Steven Aboutman to end the strike. While on the phone with him, they agree that Canada deserves more money but they do not have any to give. In a plan to raise money from the Internet, the boys post a video on "[[YouTube|YouToob]]" of Butters singing [[Samwell (entertainer)|Samwell]]'s "[[What What (In the Butt)]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?month=6&year=2008|title=FAQ}}.

In an argument over who is more famous, most of the other Internet celebrities kill each other (the fate of Laughing Baby, Back Dorm Boys and Afro Ninja is never depicted), the boys advance in line, and they receive 10 million "theoretical dollars", which are printed on clear plastic [[cheque]]s with no monetary value.

Still striking, many Canadians are dying of starvation, and a news report shows that America has brought in Danish people to fill their positions. Despite protests from Terrance and Phillip, Aboutman vows to continue the strike. When the boys present him their theoretical dollars, Aboutman is outraged, and refuses to call off the strike until he feels he has won something. Kyle convinces the world leaders to give Canada a consolation prize of gumballs and [[Bennigan's]] coupons. The strike is settled, and the boys go home where Kyle gives an extremely verbose speech about the current feasibility of generating revenue on the Internet. Aboutman throws a party to celebrate end of the strike, treating it as a great victory for Canada, but Terrance and Phillip realize that the gumballs and coupons are worth $3,008, whereas Canada lost $10.4 million by striking. As Terrance and Phillip finally reveal this to the Canadian public, as punishment, Mr. Aboutman and his men are banished by being set adrift on a block of ice.

==Production==
"Canada on Strike" was written and directed by series co-founder [[Trey Parker]], and was rated [[TV-MA]] L in the United States. It first aired on April 2, 2008 in the United States on [[Comedy Central]].

==Theme==
The episode was a criticism of the [[2007<U+2013>2008 Writers Guild of America strike]]. [[TV Squad]]'s Brad Trechak noted that "Trey Parker and Matt Stone are not members of any of the unions, and they negotiated Internet profit-sharing before it became an issue for the WGA. They have also remained consistent with their dislike of the Hollywood creative elite (including actors and writers, although they are both) and their willingness to take a different viewpoint than the popular media."<ref name="TV Squad">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/04/02/south-park-canada-on-strike/|title=South Park: Canada On Strike!|publisher=[[TV Squad]]|date=2 April 2008|accessdate=4 May 2009}}</ref> [[IGN]]'s Travis Fickett stated that "It was probably inevitable that South Park would comment on the writers' strike in some fashion, and here they do <U+2013> by way of Canada."<ref name="IGN"/> Josh Modell, writing for [[The A.V. Club]] suggested that "it's clear that Parker and Stone feel that the writers completely screwed themselves in the long run, but that subplot is almost beside the point."<ref name="AV Club">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/south-park-canada-on-strike,12905/|title=South Park: "Canada On Strike"|publisher=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=3 April 2008|accessdate=4 May 2009}}</ref>

==Reception==
Modell gave the episode an A grade as it "was a great episode because the jokes came quick and funny, not because there was some huge point to be made". A notable part of the episode for him was the viral video, "What What (In The Butt)".<ref name="AV Club"/>

Fickett gave the episode a rating of 7.6. He noted that though it was an "issue" episode, it was still humorous, unlike other such episodes like "[[Britney's New Look]]". Overall, while it wasn't a bad episode "the show muddles the argument it's trying to make by letting the parallels to Canada get off track."<ref name="IGN"/>

Trechak noted especially "the battle royal [sic] scene with all the YouTube people" and the "scintillating conversation" of the Canadians at the episode end. Trechak was "happy to see ''South Park'' get back on track to the focus and humor from the previous seasons."<ref name="TV Squad"/>

==Lawsuit==
In November 2010, Comedy Central and [[Viacom]], Comedy Central's parent company, was sued for copyright infringement for their recreation of the viral video, [[What What (In the Butt)]].<ref>http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/11/15/south-park-sued-over-two-year-old-what-what-parody/</ref>
