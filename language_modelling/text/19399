'''''The Blues Brothers''''' is a 1980 American [[musical film|musical]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[John Landis]] and starring [[John Belushi]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]] as "Joliet" Jake and Elwood Blues, characters developed from a musical sketch on the [[NBC]] variety series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. It features musical numbers by [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[soul music|soul]] singers [[James Brown]],  [[Cab Calloway]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Ray Charles]], and [[John Lee Hooker]]. The film is set in and around [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and also features non-musical supporting performances by [[John Candy]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]], and [[Henry Gibson]].

The story is a tale of [[wikt:redeem|redemption]] for [[parole]]d [[convict]] Jake (Belushi) and his brother Elwood (Aykroyd), who take on "a mission from [[God]]" to save from foreclosure the [[Catholic]] [[orphanage]] in which they grew up. To do so they must reunite their [[rhythm and blues]] band, [[The Blues Brothers]], and organize a performance to earn $5,000 to pay the tax assessor. Along the way they are targeted by a destructive "mystery woman", [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazis]], and a [[country music|country and western]] band<U+2014>all while being relentlessly pursued by the police.

Released in the United States on June&nbsp;20, 1980, it received generally good reviews with 84% of reviews positive according to the review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. It earned just under $5&nbsp;million in its opening weekend and went on to gross more than $115&nbsp;million in theaters worldwide before its release on home video.

==Plot==
"Joliet" Jake Blues is released from prison after serving three years for armed robbery. Jake is irritated at being picked up by his brother Elwood in the [[Bluesmobile]], a battered former [[Mt. Prospect, Illinois|Mount Prospect]] police car, instead of the [[Cadillac]] the brothers used to own. The brothers visit their childhood home, a [[Roman Catholic]] [[orphanage]]. They learn it will be closed unless $5,000 in [[property tax]]es is collected. The brothers visit an [[evangelism|evangelical church]] service where Jake has an epiphany: they can legitimately raise the funds by re-forming their rhythm and blues band.
  
Elwood's driving alerts two [[Illinois State Police]] troopers who learn of his suspended license. When they attempt to arrest him, he speeds off, escaping through the [[Dixie Square Mall]]. Arriving at Elwood's home, the brothers are unharmed from a [[bazooka]] attack launched by a mystery woman. The next morning, she detonates a bomb that demolishes the building, which inadvertently saves the brothers from another arrest.

Jake and Elwood begin tracking down members of the band. Trombonist Tom "Bones" Malone and the rhythm section of the group (Willie "Too Big" Hall, Steve "The Colonel" Cropper, Donald "Duck" Dunn, and Murphy "Murph" Dunne) are playing in an empty [[Holiday Inn]] lounge, and are convinced to rejoin. Trumpeter "Mr. Fabulous", now [[ma<U+00EE>tre d']] at a restaurant, is harder to sway, but Jake and Elwood rudely convince him. ''En route'' to meet saxophonist Louis "Blue Lou" Marini and guitarist Matt "Guitar" Murphy, the brothers drive through a [[neo-Nazi]] rally of "the Illinois Nazis", adding another enemy to the brothers' growing list. Marini and Murphy are at the [[soul food]] restaurant which Murphy owns with his wife. Against her advice, the two musicians leave and rejoin the band. The reunited group get instruments and equipment from a [[pawn shop]] on loan.

Jake is unable to book a gig in advance, so the band stumbles into a gig at Bob's Country Bunker, a country bar. After a rocky start, the band wins over the bottle-tossing crowd. At the end of the evening, however, not only is their bar tab greater than the pay for the gig, but the brothers infuriate the band that was actually meant to play, the Good Ol' Boys.

The Blues Brothers blackmail a booking agent into securing a gig for them&mdash;a performance at the Palace Hotel Ballroom, located 106 miles (171 km) north of Chicago. After being driven all over the area promoting the concert, the Bluesmobile runs out of gas, making Jake and Elwood late for the concert. The ballroom is packed, and the concert-goers are joined by the Good Ol' Boys and scores of police officers. Jake and Elwood sneak into the venue and perform two songs. A record company executive offers them a cash advance on a recording contract, more than enough to cover the orphanage's property taxes and the cost of the band's instruments, and tells the brothers how to slip out unnoticed.

As the brothers escape via a service tunnel, they are confronted by the mystery woman, whereupon it is revealed she is Jake's ex-[[fianc<U+00E9>e]]. She fires an [[M16 rifle]] at them, but Jake charms her before dropping her, allowing the two brothers to escape to the Bluesmobile. They head back to Chicago with dozens of state/local police and the Good Ol' Boys in pursuit. Jake and Elwood eventually elude them all, leaving piled-up police cars in their wake.

After a gravity-defying escape from the Illinois Nazis, Jake and Elwood arrive at the [[Richard J. Daley Center]], where the Bluesmobile literally falls to pieces. They rush inside the adjacent [[Chicago City Hall]] building, soon followed by hundreds of police, state troopers, SWAT teams, firefighters, Illinois National Guardsmen, and the Military Police. Finding the office of the [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] Assessor, the brothers pay the tax bill. Just as their receipt is stamped, they are arrested by a large crowd of armed law officers. Jake, now joined by Elwood and the rest of the band, are sent to prison where they play "[[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]" for fellow inmates.

==Production==
===Origins===
{{See also|The Blues Brothers}}
The characters, Jake and Elwood Blues, were created by Belushi and Aykroyd in performances on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. The name "The Blues Brothers" was the idea of [[Howard Shore]]. The fictional back story and character sketches of [[blood brother]]s Jake and Elwood were developed by Aykroyd in collaboration with Ron Gwynne, who is credited as a story consultant for the film.  As related in the liner notes of the band's debut album, ''[[Briefcase Full of Blues]]'', the brothers grew up in an [[orphanage]], learned the blues from a janitor named Curtis and sealed their brotherhood by cutting their middle fingers with a steel string said to have come from the [[guitar]] of [[Elmore James]].<ref name="Bio">{{cite web | title=Fortune City-Blues Brothers | work=Biography of the Blues Brothers-From their album, A Briefcase Full of Blues | url=http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/fitzgerald/12/bio.html|accessdate=December 16, 2008}}</ref>

When it was decided the act could be made into a film by [[Universal Pictures]], Aykroyd set about writing the script. He had never written a [[screenplay]] before, he said in the 1998 documentary, ''Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers'', and he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited. It was 324 pages, which was three times longer than a standard screenplay. To soften the impact, Aykroyd made a joke of the thick script and had it bound with the cover of the [[Los Angeles]] [[Yellow Pages]] directory for when he turned it in to producer [[Robert K. Weiss]]. [[John Landis]] was given the task of editing the script into a usable screenplay.<ref name="DVD doc">''Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers'', documentary feature on 1998 DVD and 25th Anniversary DVD (2005).</ref>

The premise of the underlying plot, that a church-owned orphanage would have to pay a property tax bill, has been questioned<U+2014>in Illinois, and generally elsewhere in the world, religious property is exempt from taxes. However, at the time of writing of the film, a legislative proposal to tax such property was under consideration. The proposal was never enacted into law.<ref name="411Mania">{{cite web|title=411Mania | work=Band: The Blues Brothers Movie: The Blues Brothers | url=http://www.411mania.com/music/columns/44932|accessdate=December 16, 2008}}</ref>

The first traffic stop was in [[Park Ridge, Illinois]]. The [[shopping mall|mall]] [[car chase]] was filmed in the real, albeit abandoned, [[Dixie Square Mall]] in [[Harvey, Illinois|Harvey]].<ref name="CLUI">{{cite web|title=The CLUI Land Use Database-Dixie Square Mall|work=The Center for Land Use Interpretation|url=http://www.clui.org/clui_4_1/ludb/sites/IL6020.html | accessdate=December 16, 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080120004258/http://www.clui.org/clui_4_1/ludb/sites/IL6020.html |archivedate = January 20, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The bridge jump was filmed on an actual drawbridge, the 95th Street bridge over the [[Calumet River]], on the southeast side of Chicago. The main entrance to [[Wrigley Field]] (and its sign reading "Save lives. Drive safely, prevent fires.") makes a brief appearance when the "Illinois Nazis" visit it after Elwood falsely registers the ball field's location, 1060 West Addison, as his home address on his driver's license. (Elwood's Illinois driver's license number is an almost-valid encoded number, with Dan Aykroyd's own birth date embedded). The other chase scenes included Lower [[Wacker Drive]], Lake Street and [[Richard J. Daley Center]].<ref name="KF1">{{cite web|title=The Blues Brothers - Chicago Filming Locations|work=Locations in the Blues Brothers|url=http://kevinforsyth.net/film/blues.htm|accessdate=December 16, 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080524050219/http://kevinforsyth.net/film/blues.htm |archivedate = May 24, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

In the final car chase scene, the production actually dropped a [[Ford Pinto]], representing the one driven by the "Illinois Nazis," from a helicopter at an altitude of more than a mile<U+2014>and had to gain a [[Special Airworthiness Certificate]] from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] to do it.<ref name="DVDLaser">{{cite web|title=The Blues Brothers|work=DVD Laser|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071014070914/http://dvdlaser.com/search/detail.cfm?id=22868|accessdate=December 16, 2008}}</ref> The FAA was concerned that the car could prove too [[aerodynamic]] in a high-altitude drop, and pose a threat to nearby buildings.  The shot leading up to the car drop, where the "Illinois Nazis" drive off a freeway ramp, was shot in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] near the [[Hoan Bridge]] on [[Interstate 794]].  The [[Lake Freeway|Lake Freeway (North)]] was a planned but not completed 6-lane freeway and [[Interstate 794|I-794]] contained an unfinished ramp that the Nazis drove off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhighways.org/milwaukee/lake.html|title=Milwaukee Freeways: Lake Freeway|first=Christopher|last=Bessert|accessdate=December 16, 2008|publisher=Wisconsin Highways}}</ref> Several Milwaukee skyscrapers are visible in the background as the [[Bluesmobile]] flips over, notably the [[US Bank Center (Milwaukee)|US Bank Center]].

The "Palace Hotel Ballroom," where the band performs its climactic concert, was at the time of filming a country club, but later became the [[South Shore Cultural Center]], named after the Chicago neighborhood in which it is located.

The filming in downtown Chicago was conducted on Sundays during the summer of 1979, and much of the downtown was cordoned off from the public.

===Bluesmobile===
{{Main|Bluesmobile}}
The film used 13 different cars bought at auction from the [[California Highway Patrol]] to depict the [[Bluesmobile]], a retired 1974 [[Mount Prospect, Illinois]] [[Dodge Monaco]] patrol car.  The vehicles were outfitted by the studio to do particular driving chores; some formatted for speed and others for jumps, depending on the scene. For the large car chases, filmmakers purchased 60 police cars at $400 each, and most were destroyed at the completion of the filming.<ref name="Chicago Sun-Times2">{{cite news|last=Newbart|first=Dave|title=Incredible stunt driving: "That was all real"|publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050728125722/http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-bbcarchase23.html|date=June 23, 2005|accessdate=December 16, 2008}}</ref> More than 40 stunt drivers were hired and the crew kept a 24-hour body shop to repair cars.<ref name="Chicago Sun-Times2">{{cite web | title=Chicago Sun-Times | work=Incredible stunt driving: "That was all real" | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050728125722/http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-bbcarchase23.html | accessdate=December 16, 2006}}</ref>

At the time of the film's release, it held the world record for the most cars destroyed in one film until it was surpassed by [[Blues Brothers 2000|its own sequel]].<ref name="Chicago Sun-Times2" />

===Casting===
In addition to recognized [[soul music|soul]] and [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] stars [[James Brown]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Ray Charles]], and [[Aretha Franklin]], the members of [[The Blues Brothers]] band are notable for their musical accomplishments as well. [[Steve Cropper]] and [[Donald Dunn]] are architects of the [[Stax Records]] sound and were half of [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]] - it is Cropper's guitar heard at the start of the [[Sam and Dave]] song "[[Soul Man (song)|Soul Man]]". Horn players [[Lou Marini]], [[Tom Malone (musician)|Tom Malone]], and [[Alan Rubin]] had all played in [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]] and the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' band. Drummer [[Willie Hall (drummer)|Willie Hall]] had played in the [[Bar-Kays]] and backed [[Isaac Hayes]]. [[Matt Murphy (blues guitarist)|Matt Murphy]] is a veteran [[blues music|blues]] guitarist. Blues performers were featured in the cast as well, with [[John Lee Hooker]] backed by harmonica player [[Big Walter Horton]] and pianist [[Pinetop Perkins]], playing "Boom Boom" on [[Maxwell Street]].

As the band developed at ''Saturday Night Live'', pianist [[Paul Shaffer]] was part of the act and was cast in the film. However, due to contractual obligations with ''SNL'', he was unable to participate. So actor-musician [[Murphy Dunne]] (whose father, [[George Dunne]], was the Cook County Board President) was hired to take his role.<ref name="DVD doc"/> Shaffer later did appear in ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]''.

[[Carrie Fisher]], [[Kathleen Freeman]], [[Henry Gibson]], and [[John Candy]] were cast in non-musical supporting roles. The film is also notable for the number of [[cameo appearance]]s by established celebrities and entertainment industry figures, including [[Steve Lawrence]] as a booking agent, [[Frank Oz]] as a corrections officer, [[Twiggy]] as a "chic lady" in a [[Jaguar E-type|Jaguar convertible]] whom Elwood propositions at a gas station, and [[Steven Spielberg]] as the Cook County Assessor's clerk. [[John Landis]] plays a state trooper in the mall chase. [[Paul Reubens]] (pre-[[Pee-wee Herman]]) has a small role as a waiter in the Ch<U+00E9>z Paul. [[Joe Walsh]] has a cameo as the first prisoner to jump up on a table in the final scene, and [[Chaka Khan]] is the soloist in James Brown's choir. The character portrayed by Cab Calloway is named Curtis as an homage to [[Curtis Salgado]], a [[Portland, Oregon]], blues musician who inspired Belushi while he was in Oregon filming ''[[Animal House]]''.<ref name="CS">{{cite web|title=Biography|work=Curtis Salgado|url=http://www.curtissalgado.com/biography.html|accessdate=December 16, 2008}}</ref>

Over 500 extras were used for the next to the last scene, the blockade on the building at Daley Center, including 200 [[National Guard]]smen, 100 state and city police officers, and 15 [[horse]]s.<ref name="HappyRam"/><ref name="Chicago Sun-Times3">{{cite news|title=Blues Brothers 25th Anniversary|publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''| url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050721084943/http://www.suntimes.com/special_sections/bluebros/|accessdate=December 16, 2008}}</ref> Additionally, three [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]], three [[helicopter]]s, and three [[Fire apparatus|fire engines]] were used.<ref name="HappyRam"/> The movie ends with a performance of "Jailhouse Rock" in prison.

''The Blues Brothers'' has been criticized for its simplistic plot and being overly reliant on [[car chase]]s. Among the reviewers at the time of the film's release who held that opinion was [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. However, Ebert praised it for its energetic musical numbers and said that the car chases were "incredible".<ref name="RE">{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|title=The Blues Brothers|publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19800101/REVIEWS/1010306/1023|accessdate=December 16, 2008}}</ref> In his review for the ''[[Washington Post]]'', Gary Arnold criticized Landis engorging "the frail plot of ''The Blues Brothers'' with car chases and crack-ups, filmed with such avid, humorless starkness on the streets of Chicago that comic sensations are virtually obliterated".<ref name="Arnold">{{cite news|last=Arnold|first=Gary|authorlink=|title=Oh, Brothers!|publisher=''[[Washington Post]]''|url= | accessdate=}}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, "''The Blues Brothers'' is a demolition symphony that works with the cold efficiency of a Moog synthesizer gone sadistic".<ref name="Corliss">{{cite news|last=Corliss|first=Richard|authorlink=|title=A Great Rock-'n'-Roll Caravan|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952710-1,00.html | accessdate=September 15, 2009 | date=July 7, 1980}}</ref>

[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' criticized the film for shortchanging viewers on more details about Jake and Elwood's affinity for African-American culture. She also took director Landis to task for "distracting editing", mentioning the Soul Food diner scene in which saxophonist [[Lou Marini]]'s head is cut off as he dances on the counter. In the documentary, ''Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers'', Landis acknowledges the criticism, and Marini recalls the dismay he felt at seeing the completed film.<ref name="JM">{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|authorlink=Janet Maslin|title=The Blues Brothers (1980)|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C05E6D61638F933A15755C0A966948260 | accessdate=December 16, 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071014070449/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C05E6D61638F933A15755C0A966948260 |archivedate = October 14, 2007|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>

''The Blues Brothers: Music from the Soundtrack'' was released on June 20, 1980 as the second album by [[The Blues Brothers|the Blues Brothers Band]], which also toured that year to promote the film. "[[Gimme Some Lovin']]" was a Top 20 [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] hit, peaking at number 18.<ref name="Billboard18">{{cite web|title=The Billboard Hot 100: Gimme Some Lovin'|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=379&cfgn=Singles&cfn=The+Billboard+Hot+100&ci=3071100&cdi=8892332&cid=06%2F07%2F1980|accessdate=June 6, 2009}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref> The album was a followup to their debut, the live album, ''[[Briefcase Full of Blues]]''. Later that year they released a second live album, ''[[Made in America (Blues Brothers album)|Made in America]]'', which featured the Top 40 track, "Who's Making Love".<ref name="Billboard39">{{cite web|title=The Billboard Hot 100: Who's Making Love|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=379&cfgn=Singles&cfn=The+Billboard+Hot+100&ci=3071136&cdi=8895937&cid=02%2F14%2F1981|accessdate=June 6, 2009}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref>

The songs on the soundtrack album are a noticeably different [[audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mix]] than in the film, with a prominent [[baritone saxophone]] in the horn line (also heard in the film during "Shake a Tail Feather," though no bari sax is present), and female backing vocals on "Everybody Needs Somebody to Love", though the band had no backup singers in the film. A number of regular Blues Brothers' members, including saxophonist [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]] and drummer [[Steve Jordan (musician)|Steve Jordan]], perform on the soundtrack album but are not in the film.

According to director Landis in the 1998 documentary ''The Stories Behind the Making of 'The Blues Brothers''', filmed musical performances by Franklin and Brown took more effort, as neither artist was accustomed to [[Lip sync|lip-synching]] their performances on film. Franklin required several takes, and Brown simply rerecorded his performance live. Cab Calloway initially wanted to do a disco variation on his signature tune, "Minnie The Moocher", having done the song in several styles in the past, but Landis insisted that the song be done faithful to the original big band version.

==Sequel==
{{Main|Blues Brothers 2000}}
The 1998 sequel, ''Blues Brothers 2000'', had similar traits to the original, including large car chase scenes and musical numbers. John Landis returned to direct the film and [[Dan Aykroyd]] reprised his role, joining [[John Goodman]], [[Joe Morton]], and 10-year-old [[J. Evan Bonifant]] as the new Blues Brothers. [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[James Brown]] were among the celebrities returning from the first film. There were also musical performances by [[Sam Moore]], [[Wilson Pickett]], [[Paul Shaffer]], [[B. B. King]], and [[Eric Clapton]], among others. Dozens of artists were packed into an all-star band called [[Blues Brothers 2000#The Louisiana Gator Boys|The Louisiana Gator Boys]].

The film was considered a box office failure, only generating a little over $14 million in box office sales<ref name="BOM2">{{cite web|title=Blues Brothers 2000|work=Box Office Mojo| url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bluesbrothers2000.htm|accessdate=December 16, 2008}}</ref> on an approximate $28 million budget.<ref name="RTBudget"/>
