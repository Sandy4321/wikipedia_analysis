'''Andre Joseph Lacroix''' (born [[June 5]], [[1945]], in [[Lauzon, Quebec]]) is a retired professional [[ice hockey]] player in the [[National Hockey League]] and the [[World Hockey Association]], and was the WHA's all-time leading career scorer.

==Playing career==
A small center notable for his playmaking, penalty-killing and faceoff skill, Lacroix played his junior hockey for the [[Peterborough Petes]], leading the [[Ontario Hockey Association|league]] in assists in both the 1964-65 and 1965-66 seasons and in points the latter season.  He then played two seasons for the minor-league [[Quebec Aces]] of the [[American Hockey League|AHL]], playing brilliantly in the 1968 season before being recalled by the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] of the NHL in the spring of [[1967-68 NHL season|1968]].  Paired on a forward line with fellow ex-Quebec wingers [[Jean-Guy Gendron]] and [[Simon Nolet]], he was an immediate star, leading the Flyers in scoring in both [[1968-69 NHL season|1969]] and [[1969-70 NHL season|1970]].

After the [[1970-71 NHL season|1971]] season Lacroix was traded to the [[Chicago Black Hawks]], and dismayed at the change of scenery, played poorly the next year.  However, in the fall of 1972, the upstart [[World Hockey Association]] began play, and he lost no chance to return to Philadelphia and sign with the league's [[Philadelphia Blazers]] franchise.  Despite the team going through much tumult and controversy, Lacroix was an immediate star for the squad, leading the WHA in points that season with a 50-74-124 mark.

However, in the offseason, the franchise was transferred to [[Vancouver]], and Lacroix was traded to an even shakier team, the [[New York Golden Blades]] for the [[1973-74 WHA season|1974]] season.  Again, despite tumult that caused the team to be moved to New Jersey mid-season and payrolls to be missed, he was a standout, leading the WHA in assists with 80.  That fall, Lacroix was named to [[Team Canada]] for the [[1974 Summit Series]] against the [[Soviet national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]], scoring one goal and six assists in eight games to be the team's second leading scorer.

The New York-New Jersey team moved yet again for the [[1974-75 WHA season|1975]] to California to become the [[San Diego Mariners]], and Lacroix continued his success.  In that first season in San Diego, he achieved his second league scoring title and racked up 106 assists, the professional record at the time and the only player other than [[Bobby Orr]] who had ever reached 100 assists in a single season.  Lacroix scored over 100 points the next two seasons with the Mariners as well, before the franchise folded.

He continued to star in two more seasons before the end of the WHA, for the [[Houston Aeros]] in [[1977-78 WHA season|1978]] and the [[New England Whalers]] in [[1978-79 WHA season|1979]].  His skills diminishing at last, Lacroix played briefly and respectably for the Whalers after their move to the NHL in the [[1979-80 NHL season|1980]] season before retiring.

Andre has been involved with hockey since retiring, creating the Andre Lacroix Power Hockey Academy and was the Director of hockey programs at the Oakland Ice Center until 2005.
