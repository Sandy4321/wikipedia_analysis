'''Robert Winchelsey''' or '''Winchelsea''' ([[Circa|c]]. 1245&ndash;1313) was an English [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology|theologian]] and [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. He studied at the universities of [[Paris]] and [[Oxford]], and later taught at both schools. Influenced by [[Thomas Aquinas]], Winchelsey was a [[scholasticism|scholastic]] theologian. He held various benefices in England and was named chancellor of [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] before being elected to Canterbury in early 1293. Although he initially had the support of King [[Edward I of England]], later Winchelsey was a forceful opponent of the king. The archbishop was encouraged by the papacy to resist Edward's attempts to tax the clergy. Winchelsey was also an opponent of the king's treasurer [[Walter Langton]] as well as other clergy. At one point, the archbishop rebuked an abbot so sternly that the abbot suffered a fatal heart attack.

With the election of a former royal clerk as [[Pope Clement V]] in 1305, the king was able to secure the archbishop's exile in 1305. After the succession of Edward's son, King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], Winchelsey was allowed to return to England when the new king petitioned the pope to allow the archbishop's return. Winchelsey soon joined the king's enemies, however, and was the only bishop to object to the return of the king's favorite [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]].  He died in 1313, and while miracles were alleged to have happened at his tomb, an attempt to have him declared a saint led nowhere.

He studied and then taught at the universities of [[University of Paris|Paris]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], where he attained celebrity as a scholar, and became rector of the former, and subsequently chancellor of the latter university. While in Paris, Robert read, and possibly met, [[Thomas Aquinas]], and his own theology was thereafter purely scholastic.<ref name=DNB>Denton "Winchelsey, Robert (c.1240<U+2013>1313)" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29713 Online Edition] accessed November 8, 2007</ref> In 1283, he was appointed canon of [[St Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul's]] in [[London]], but it is unclear exactly when he returned to [[England]]. He held the [[Prebendary|prebend]] of [[Oxgate]] in the [[diocese of London]],<ref name=BHOOxgate>[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=33829 British History Online Prebends of Oxgate] accessed on September 11, 2007</ref> and was made [[archdeacon of Essex]], also in the London diocese, about 1288.<ref name=BHOArchDEssex>[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=33803 British History Online Archdeacons of Essex in London] accessed on September 11, 2007</ref>

==Archbishop==
===Election===
In December of 1292 [[John Peckham]], archbishop of Canterbury, died, and early in the following year Winchelsea was elected as his successor, the election taking place on [[February 13]].<ref name=Handbook233>Fryde ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 233</ref> Unusually, neither the pope nor the king had a hand in his election.<ref name=DNB/> His consecration, which took place at [[L'Aquila|Aquila]] in September of 1294, was delayed owing to the vacancy in the [[Pope|papacy]], but he found no difficulty in obtaining the consent of his election from [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]].<ref name=BHOCant>[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=33853 British History Online Archbishops of Canterbury] accessed on September 11, 2007</ref>

===Disputes with Edward===
[[Image:Edward I & II.jpg|thumb|left|Edward I creating his son Prince of Wales. Robert served both kings]]
He was a fearless opponent of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]. When he swore his oath of fealty to Edward, he got off on the wrong foot, because he tacked on to the oath a declaration that he was only swearing fealty for the [[temporalities]], not the [[spiritualities]]. From the start of his reign as archbishop, he proved willing to refuse to allow Edward to tax the clergy beyond certain levels, and withstood severe pressure to change his mind. In August of 1295, he would only offer the king a tenth of all ecclesiastical revenues, which was less than what Edward had hoped to collect from the clergy. Winchelsey did say that if the war with France, which was what the money was requested to fund, continued into the next year, that the clergy would be amenable to further contributions.<ref name=Edward405>Prestwich ''Edward I'' p. 405</ref>

Strengthened by the issue of the papal bull ''[[Clericis laicos]]'' in 1296, which forbade the payment of taxes to a secular power, he stimulated the clergy of his province to refuse pecuniary assistance to Edward in 1297. However, the clergy of the province of York paid a tax of a fifth of their revenues with only a little grumbling. Edward then pronounced a sentence of [[outlaw]]ry against the clerical delinquents, and ordered that all the property of the clergy should be seized. Edward offered that the clergy could return to the king's protection if they paid a fine of a fifth of their revenues, exactly what the northern clergy had offered in the way of taxation. The northern clergy paid their fines, as well as the royal clerks and many other of the clergy. In March, the southern clergy met again, and after a long debate, Winchelsley instructed each clerk to decide whether to pay the fine for himself. It appears that most clergy paid.<ref name=Edward415>Prestwich ''Edward I'' p. 415-417</ref> Personally the archbishop still declined to make any contribution towards the expenses of the French war, and his lands were seized and held by Edward until July of 1297, when a somewhat ostentatious reconciliation between king and prelate took place at [[Westminster]].<ref name=Powell232>Powell ''The House of Lords in the Middle Ages'' p. 232-235</ref> Winchelsey then tried to mediate between Edward and the earls, who had also objected to Edward's taxation demands.<ref name=Edward420>Prestwich ''Edward I'' p. 420</ref>

Winchelsea further irritated Edward with his opposition to the [[Bishop of Lichfield]], [[Walter Langton]], who was the king's [[Lord High Treasurer|treasurer]].<ref name=DNB/> Robert didn't only irritate the king. When he rebuked the abbot of Oseney in 1297, the poor abbot was so affected that he suffered a fatal heart attack.<ref name=Edward412>Prestwich ''Edward I'' p. 412-413</ref>

His struggles with the king did not exhaust his energies. He asserted his authority over his suffragans to the full; quarrelled with [[Pope Boniface VIII]] over the presentation to a [[Sussex]] living, and was [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by one of the pope's clerks in 1301 but was absolved in 1302;<ref name=BHOCant/> and vigorously contested the claim of the archbishop of [[York]] to carry his cross erect in the province of Canterbury.

Briefly in 1299, Winchelsey and the king were on good enough terms that the archbishop who officiated at the second marriage of the king, when he married [[Marguerite of France (born 1282)|Margaret of France]] at Canterbury.<ref name=Edward521>Prestwich ''Edward I'' p. 521</ref>

===Exile and return===
[[Image:Bonifatius VIII Grabstatue.JPG|right|thumb|A statue of Pope Boniface VIII, from Florence. Robert supported Boniface's claims to be protector of Scotland.]] 
Joining the barons in demanding certain reforms from Edward at the parliament of Lincoln in 1301, he compelled the king to give way on the main issues; but the indignation which followed the claim of [[Pope Boniface VIII]] to be the protector of Scotland, a claim which was supported by Winchelsea, led to the rupture of this alliance. It is probable that one of the reasons which led the archbishop to join in these proceedings was his hostility to Edward's adviser, [[Walter Langton]], bishop of [[Lichfield]], whom he sought to disgrace both in England and at Rome. The king cherished his indignation until the Gascon and a former royal clerk Bertrand de Got was named [[Pope Clement V]] in 1305, when he made his final move against Winchelsea.<ref name=Edward540>Prestwich ''Edward I'' p. 540-541</ref> Listening to Edward's envoys, Langton and [[Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln|Henry Lacy]], [[earl of Lincoln]] who claimed that the archbishop had plotted against the king, Clement suspended the archbishop on [[February 12]] [[1306]],<ref name=BHOCant/> who, after vainly imploring the intercession of the king, left England and journeyed to the papal court at [[Bordeaux]], remaining in exile until Edward's death in July of 1307. Only [[Antony Bek]], [[Bishop of Durham]] supported the archbishop.<ref name=DNB/>

After the death of Edward I, the new king, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], requested Clement to allow Winchelsea to return to his see.<ref name=Powell266>Powell ''The House of Lords in the Middle Ages'' p. 266</ref> The pope assented and restored him to his see on [[January 22]] [[1308]],<ref name=BHOCant/> but soon after his return to England in early 1308 the archbishop joined the king's enemies;<ref name=Weir42>Weir ''Queen Isabella'' p. 42</ref> even demanding the release from prison of his old enemy, Langton. He, along with the [[Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], was the only person to object to the return of [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]] to England in 1309.<ref name=Weir49>Weir ''Queen Isabella'' p. 49</ref> He aided the [[baron]]s in their prosecution of Edward II by sentencing their enemies to [[excommunication]],<ref name=Weir55>Weir ''Queen Isabella'' p. 55</ref> and took part in the proceedings against the [[Knights Templar]]s. He was one of the [[Ordinances of 1311|Ordainers]] appointed in 1310.<ref name=Powell275>Powell ''The House of Lords in the Middle Ages'' p. 275-276</ref> He died at [[Otford]] on [[May 11]] [[1313]].<ref name=Handbook233/><ref name=DNB/>

==Legacy==
Robert was a preacher of some note, and when he was preaching at St. Paul's he attracted large crowds to his sermons and lectures.<ref name=Moorman162>Moorman ''Church Life in England in the Middle Ages'' p. 162-163</ref> Robert of Winchelsea's theological writings date primarily from his time at St. Paul's, where he delivered a number of ''quodibeta''.  The ''quaestiones disputatae'' from those sessions survive and illustrate his highly orthodox trinitarian views and his scholastic method.<ref name=DNB/>

Miracles were said to have been worked at his tomb in Canterbury cathedral, but efforts to procure his canonization were unavailing.<ref name=DNB/> Although a secular priest, Winchelsea was somewhat ascetic, and his private life was distinguished for sanctity and generosity. As an ecclesiastic, however, he was haughty and fond of power; and he has been not inappropriately described as "the greatest churchman of the time."
