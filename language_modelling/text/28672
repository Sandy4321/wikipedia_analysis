'''Ambattur''' is a part of Chennai Corporation. Closer to [[Anna Nagar]], [[Padi]] and [[Avadi]], Ambattur is a fast developing residential locality and [[Information technology|IT]] hub of Chennai. It covers an area of 45&nbsp;km<U+00B2>.

==Etymology==
This place is one of 108 Shakthi Sthals in the country. The Amman (Durga) temple here is 51st in the order and therefore this place was called "aimbaththu Oram ur', meaning 51st place/Temple village in Tamil, which later transmuted as Ambattur. The Goddess is worshiped in the form of Vaishnavi.

Ambattur comes under the new Sriperumbudur parliamentary constituency. It was previously under the North Chennai parliamentary constituency and along with Villivakkam, it was the largest assembly constituency in India. The [[delimitation]] process of assembly constituencies has given Ambattur a new identity of its own. Constituency no : 8, Tamil Nadu.  Once a major panchayat, Ambattur was made a township in the 1960s and a selection grade municipality from April 1975. In May 1992, it was raised to special grade municipality.<ref>[http://municipality.tn.gov.in/Ambattur/about_municipality.html]</ref> It was a municipality till October 2011. It was divided into 52 wards. Ambattur Municipality includes [[Padi, Chennai|Padi]], [[Korattur]], [[Anna Nagar]] Western Extension, [[Mogappair]] and Ambattur Industrial Estate areas.

Ambattur has two main waterbodies, namely  the [[Ambattur Lake|Ambattur Eri]] and the [[Chithu Oragadam Eri|Chithu Oragadam Lake]] and the bigger [[Puzhal eri]] on the outskirts. The upkeep of the Ambattur Eri is plagued by problems such as dumping of garbage,<ref>[http://archives.chennaionline.com/science/Environment/dump.asp  Chennai Online]</ref> water mining and construction of buildings and the Chithu Oragadam (Thangal) Eri suffers due to pollution by sewage.<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/2004/06/06/stories/2004060611440300.htm  The Hindu]</ref> The local body generates nearly 250 tonnes of garbage daily.<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/2011/04/27/stories/2011042751080300.htm Garbage burning sets off problems for Ambattur]</ref>

==Economy==

The Economy of Ambattur is mainly industrial. It was well known as an Auto ancillary hub. However, recently many IT companies have come up in Ambattur.

===Ambattur Industrial Estate===
The Ambattur Industrial Estate, spread over an area of 1,430 acres (4.9&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), houses about 1,800 units<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Chennai/article1547862.ece Arterial roads in Ambattur Estate to be widened soon]</ref> and is the biggest small scale industrial estate in [[South Asia]]. It was commissioned in the year 1964 by the Government of Tamil Nadu. Several factors such as suitability of the soil, communication facilities, availability of raw materials, a large volume of ground water suitable for industrial and domestic purposes, and the like were responsible for seeking this place for the setting up of an industrial estate. An area of 4&nbsp;km<U+00B2> adjoining the industrial estate was acquired by the Tamil Nadu Housing Board for housing purposes.

Companies like [http://www.britannia.co.in Britannia Industries Limited], [[TI Cycles of India]], [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]], [[TVS, India|TVS]] have their plants in Ambattur.
