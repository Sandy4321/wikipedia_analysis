The '''effects of Hurricane Isabel in New York and New England''' were relatively minor and primarily limited to wind damage. [[Hurricane Isabel]] formed from a [[tropical wave]] on September 6 2003 in the tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165&nbsp;mph (265&nbsp;km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] with winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] over western [[Pennsylvania]] the next day.

Damage in [[New York]] totaled $90&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $105&nbsp;million 2008&nbsp;USD),<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven & Hugh Cobb|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2007-01-30|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003isabel.shtml}}</ref> with [[Vermont]] reporting about $100,000 in damage (2003&nbsp;USD, $117,000 in 2008&nbsp;USD). Falling trees from moderate winds downed power lines across the region, causing sporadic power outages. Two people died as a result of the hurricane, both due to the rough surf from Isabel.

==Preparations==
Hours before Isabel made landfall on North Carolina, the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] for a portion of the southern [[Long Island]] coastline from the [[New Jersey]]/New York border to [[Moriches, New York|Moriches]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven & Hugh Cobb|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2007-01-30|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2003isabel.shtml}}</ref> About a day before the hurricane moved ashore, forecasters estimated the hurricane possessed a 10% chance of passing within 75&nbsp;miles (120&nbsp;km) of [[New York City]]. Other portions of southern [[New England]] were estimated to have similar probabilities, with the same forecast predicting a 3% chance for it passing within 75&nbsp;miles (120&nbsp;km) of [[Eastport, Maine]].<ref name="prob45">{{cite web|author=Beven|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Probabilities 45|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-01-30|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/prb/al132003.prblty.045.shtml?}}</ref> By about two days before Isabel struck land until several hours after it moved ashore, forecasters predicted the storm to pass over western New York as a transitioning tropical cyclone before passing into [[Canada]] as an extratropical cyclone.<ref name="archive">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2003|title=Hurricane Isabel Advisory Archive|accessdate=2007-01-30|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/ISABEL.shtml}}</ref>

[[List of Governors of New York|New York Governor]] [[George Pataki]] urged residents to purchase emergency supplies and to fill cars with gasoline. The State Emergency Management Office began preparing for the hurricane about a week before it moved ashore. The office also issued a Level 1 emergency activation, with a planning unit readying contingency plans and in coordinating the efforts of other state offices. The state's [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] began preliminary preparations for possible support efforts by reviewing the list of personnel able to be mobilized in the event of an emergency. Army and Air National Guard officials identified needed equipment in the event of an emergency, such as helicopters, generators, high-axle vehicles, and communications equipment. State police officers established contingency plans for personnel and equipment to assist as needed. The State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation ensured needed equipment were operational, and also secured buildings with sandbags to prevent flooding.<ref name="nysdot">{{cite web|author=Office of Media Relations|year=2003|title=Governor Pataki Announces State Gearing Up for Isabel|publisher=New York State Department of Transportation|accessdate=2007-01-31|url=https://www.nysdot.gov/portal/page/portal/news/press-releases/2003/2003209}}</ref> Seven airlines allowed travelers potentially affected by the hurricane to reschedule their flights to a later date.<ref name="airtravel">{{cite web|author=Air Travel.com|year=2003|title=Changing Tickets in the Path of a Hurricane|accessdate=2007-01-31|url=http://airtravel.about.com/cs/airtravellinks/a/hurricane.htm}}</ref>
