Norwich City F.C. was formed following a meeting at the Criterion Cafe in Norwich on 17 June 1902 and then a sub meeting occurred on 2 July 1902 by a group of friends led by three former [[Norwich CEYMS F.C.|Norwich CEYMS]] players, Robert Webster, Joseph Cowper and Brad Skelly,<ref name=founded/><ref>[http://www.canaries.co.uk/page/History/0,,10355~1023784,00.html Club history 1902 to 1940] Norwich City FC</ref> and played their first competitive match against [[Harwich & Parkeston F.C.|Harwich & Parkeston]], at Newmarket Road on 6 September 1912.<ref>{{cite book

</ref>  Following a [[the Football Association|FA]] Commission, the club was ousted from the amateur game in 1905, deemed a professional organisation.  Later that year Norwich were elected to play in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] and with increasing crowds, they were forced to leave Newmarket Road in 1908, moving to The Nest, a disused chalk pit. The club's original nickname was the Citizens, although this was superseded by 1907 by the more familiar Canaries.This was because the breeding and keeping of the birds was popular at this time. During the [[First World War]], with football suspended and facing spiralling debts, City went into voluntary [[liquidation]] on 10 December 1917.<ref name=earlyhistory>{{Cite web

==Colours and crest==
Norwich City's nickname, "The Canaries", has long influenced the team's colours and crest.<!-- references follow! --> Originally, the club was nicknamed the '''Citizens''' ("Cits" for short<!-- referenced below -->), and played in light blue and white halved shirts,<ref name=earlyhistory>{{Cite web

The earliest known recorded link between the club and canaries, comes in an interview recorded in the [[Eastern Daily Press]] with newly appointed manager, [[John Bowman (football manager)|John Bowman]] in April 1905. The paper quotes him saying "Well I knew of the City's existence... I have... heard of the canaries."<ref name = p24/> "This as far as we can tell is the first time that the popular pastime of the day ie... rearing... canaries was linked with Norwich City FC<!-- sic -->... the club still played in blue and white, and would continue to do so for another two seasons."<ref name=p24/> But the city of Norwich had long connections with canaries owing to its 15th and 16th century links to Flemish weavers who had imported the birds to the Low Countries from the Dutch colonies in the Caribbean.

By February 1907, the nickname '''Canaries''' had come more into vogue; thoughts that an FA Cup tie against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] (nicknamed "Throstles" after a bird) was "a bird -singing contest" were dismissed by the [[polymath]] [[C.B. Fry]] as "humbug" but Bowman and Fry's colleagues in the national press increasingly referred to the team as Canaries.<ref>{{cite book

  | pages = 28<U+2013>29 }}</ref>
[[Image:Arms of Norwich.svg|100px|thumb|City of Norwich Coat of Arms]]
The following season, to match the nickname, City played for the first time in Canary livery; "yellow shirts with green collars and cuffs. One paper produced the quote 'The Cits are dead but the Canaries are very much alive'."<ref>{{cite book
  | last =  Eastwood
  | title = Canary Citizens
  | pages = 29 }}</ref> Apart from the obvious colour link, a canary may seem an odd choice; however, many English football clubs have adopted small birds as emblems that symbolise agility and deftness around the field.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Soccer Tribe |last=Morris |first=Desmond |authorlink=Desmond Morris|year=1981 |publisher=Jonathan Cape |location=London |isbn=0-224-01935-X |pages=210}}</ref>

The French [[Ligue 1]] team [[FC Nantes]] which was founded 41 years after Norwich City is also nicknamed The Canaries ''(Les Canaris)'' and again, like the Norfolk team, also sports a green and yellow home strip. Turkish S<U+00FC>per Lig club [[Fenerbah<U+00E7>e S.K.|Fenerbah<U+00E7>e]] are also known as The Canaries; they wear a yellow and blue home strip. Japanese J.

A two-tier terrace was built at the River End and soon after seats began to replace the terraces.  By 1979 the stadium had a capacity of 28,392 with seats for 12,675.

Locally, much is made of the informal title "[[Pride of Anglia]]". Fans variously claim the title for either winning the East Anglian Derby, finishing highest in the league, having the better current league position, having the more successful club history or for reasons without any apparent logical basis.  The club's main local rival is [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].  When Norwich and Ipswich meet it is known as the '[[East Anglian Derby]]', or, informally, as the '[[Old Farm Derby]]', a comic reference to the '[[Old Firm]] Derby' played between Scottish teams [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].<ref>{{cite news

On 8 May 2007 the football club announced that [[Andrew and Sharon Turner]] had bought out all 5,000 shares belonging to former Board member, [[Barry Skipper]] and had given the club an interest-free loan of <U+00A3>2m. Mr and Mrs Turner are owners and directors of personal finance company [[Central Trust|Central Trust plc]].

During July 2008 [[Peter Cullum]] declared that he was interested in a takeover of the club, and pledged that he would invest <U+00A3>20m for enhancement of the playing squad. On 8 July the EDP reported that [[Delia Smith]] and the board had invited [[Peter Cullum]] for talks. Reports later stated that the talks had been terminated with immediate effect, and no deal was to be reached.

On 2 September 2008, [[Andrew and Sharon Turner]] announced that they were leaving the football club's board of directors. This left a <U+00A3>2 million hole in Norwich City's budget. On 4 September 2008, [[Delia Smith]] and [[Michael Wynn Jones]] announced that they would be injecting <U+00A3>2 million, avoiding financial problems for the club. 

It is, however, widely believed despite this <U+00A3>2 million injection, [[Delia Smith]] and [[Michael Wynn Jones]] are interested in selling their majority shareholding in the club. Chairman [[Roger Munby]] confirmed on 4 September 2008 that talks are ongoing with multiple potential investors.

Norwich's record home attendance is 43,984 for a sixth round [[FA Cup]] match against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] on 30 March 1963.  With the introduction of regulations enforcing all-seater stadiums, it is unlikely that this record will be beaten in the foreseeable future.

}}</ref> the eponymous hero, played by [[Ricky Tomlinson]], rises to prominence as a result of success as manager of Norwich City, having won the 'Mr Clutch Cup'. The celebratory scenes of the open-top bus ride around the city (right) were actually shot in [[St Albans]], rather than Norwich.

In 1972 the [[Children's Film Foundation]] released a movie called "[[The Boy Who Turned Yellow]]", about a boy living in London who supports Norwich City. In the film, he and everyone and everything else on his [[London Underground|tube]] train are turned yellow. That night he is visited by a yellow alien called Nick, short for electronic, who teaches him all about electricity. The link to the football club is used to explain why the boy already has so many yellow things in his bedroom.<ref>[http://www.powell-pressburger.org/Reviews/72_BWTY/BWTY00.html The Powell & Pressburger Pages]</ref>

In 1997, the film version of [[Nick Hornby]]'s book ''[[Fever Pitch (1997 film)|Fever Pitch]]'' told of the 1988-89 season, in which Norwich City, still in contention for the league title on May 1, when games were resumed following the [[Hillsborough disaster]], played at [[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]], the favorite club of the film's protagonist, Paul Ashworth ([[Colin Firth]]).  Notoriously pessimistic about Arsenal's chances despite their current first-place status, Paul says, "I want us to win.  And I think we will." His friend Steve ([[Mark Strong]]) says, "Well, that's new.  Home to Norwich, you'd usually be predicting, what, a 2-0 defeat? Nil-nil, maybe, if you was really on top of the world?" But, buoyed by several strokes of good luck (and by Hornby, also the film's scriptwriter, having the benefit of hindsight), Paul predicts a 5-0 victory, which turns to be the exact score, knocking Norwich out of the race, in which they finished fourth, their best first-division finish until the 1992-93 season.
 
On 28 February 2005, majority shareholder Delia Smith put Norwich into the limelight at half-time during a televised home match against Manchester City. With relegation from the Premier League looking likely, Delia took hold of the microphone and in an effort to rally the crowd, shouted <U+201C>A message for the best football supporters in the world: We need a 12th man here.
