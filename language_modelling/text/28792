The '''Battle of Taejon''' (July 14&ndash;21, 1950) was an early battle between [[United States]] and [[North Korean]] forces during the [[Korean War]]. Forces of the [[United States Army]], attempting to defend the headquarters of the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]] were overwhelmed by numerically superior [[Korean People's Army]] at the major city and transportation hub of [[Taejon]]. The 24th Infantry Division's regiments were already exhausted from the previous two weeks of fighting to stem the advance of the North Korean Army. 

The entire division gathered to make a final stand around Taejon, holding a line along the [[Kum River]] to the east of the city. Hampered by lack of communications equipment and shortages of heavy weapons to match North Korean fire-power, the American forces, outnumbered, ill-equipped and untrained, were pushed back from the river bank after several days, before fighting an intense [[urban warfare|urban battle]] to defend the city. After a fierce three-day struggle, the Americans withdrew. 

Although they could not hold the city, the 24th Infantry Division achieved a tactical victory by delaying the North Koreans, providing time for other American divisions to establish a [[Pusan Perimeter|defensive perimeter around Pusan]] further south. The delay imposed at Taejon probably prevented an American rout during the subsequent [[Battle of the Pusan Perimeter]]. Also significant, the North Koreans captured [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[William F. Dean]], the commander of the 24th Infantry Division, and highest ranking American [[prisoner of war|prisoner]] during the Korean War.

== Background ==
=== Outbreak of war ===
[[File:Korean front 071350.JPG|thumb|left|Front line of Korean War, July 13, 1950|alt=Arrows symbolizing the North Korean Army pressing against US and South Korean positions]]
Following the invasion of the [[Republic of Korea]] (South Korea) by its northern neighbour, the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (North Korea), the [[United Nations]] committed troops to the conflict on behalf of South Korea. The United States subsequently sent ground forces to the Korean peninsula to contain the North Korean invasion and to prevent the collapse of the South Korean state. Problematically, US forces in the [[Far East]] had been steadily decreased since the end of [[World War II]], five years earlier. When troops were initially committed, the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]] of the [[Eighth United States Army]], headquartered in [[Japan]], was the closest US division.<ref name="Apple59">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=59}}</ref> The division was understrength, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to [[Louis A. Johnson#Defense budget reductions|defense cutbacks]] enacted in the first [[Harry S. Truman#Defense cutbacks|Truman administration]]. Regardless, the 24th Infantry Division was ordered into South Korea.<ref name="Var3">{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=3}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=60}}</ref>

The 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea to absorb the initial "shock" of North Korean advances, and delay the much larger North Korean units. Its delaying tactic would buy time for the deployment of additional forces.<ref name=Alexander52>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=52}}</ref> The 24th Division single-handedly delayed the North Korean advance to allow the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]], [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]], [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]], and other Eighth Army supporting units to move into position.<ref name=Alexander52/>

=== Delaying action ===
Advance elements of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the [[Battle of Osan]] on July 5, during the first battle between American and North Korean forces.<ref>{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=15}}</ref> The force at the battle, Task Force Smith, retreated from Osan to [[Pyongtaek]], where US forces were again defeated in the [[Battle of Pyongtaek]].<ref name="Alex90"/> For the first month after the defeat of Task Force Smith, 24th Infantry Division soldiers were repeatedly defeated and forced south by the North Korean force's superior numbers and equipment.<ref name="Alex90">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=90}}</ref><ref name="Var4">{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=4}}</ref> The regiments of the 24th Infantry Division were systematically pushed south at and around [[Battle of Chochiwon|Chochiwon]], [[Battle of Chonan|Chonan]], Pyongtaek, [[Hadong]], and [[Yechon]].<ref name="Var4"/> American soldiers were untrained and unprepared for war at the outbreak of the conflict in Korea, and this lack of training showed in engagements with North Korean units which were much more disciplined. Most of the Americans were out of shape, untrained, undisciplined and used to occupation duty in Japan.<ref>{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=60}}</ref> Most were raw recruits who had never seen combat before.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=63}}</ref>

On July 12, the division's commander, [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[William F. Dean]], ordered the division's three regiments, the [[19th Infantry Regiment (United States)|19th Infantry Regiment]], [[21st Infantry Regiment (United States)|21st Infantry Regiment]], and [[34th Infantry Regiment (United States)|34th Infantry Regiment]], to cross the Kum River, destroying all bridges behind them, and to establish defensive positions around Taejon. Taejon was a major South Korean city {{convert|100|mi}} south of Seoul and {{convert|130|mi}} northwest of Pusan, and was the site of the 24th Infantry Division's headquarters.<ref>{{harvnb|Summers|2001|p=266}}</ref> Dean formed a line with the 34th Infantry and 19th Infantry facing east, and held the heavily-battered 21st Infantry in reserve to the southeast.<ref name="Fehr88"/> The Kum River wrapped north and west around the city, providing a defensive line 10 to 15 miles from the outskirts of Taejon, which is surrounded to the south by the [[Sobaek Mountains]]. With major railroad junctions and numerous roads leading into the countryside in all directions, Taejon stood as a major transportation hub between Seoul and [[Taegu]], giving it great strategic value for both the American and North Korean forces.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|1998|p=121}}</ref> The division was attempting to make a last stand at Taejon, the last place it could conduct a delaying action before the North Korean forces would converge on the unfinished Pusan Perimeter.<ref name="Fehr92"/>

== Forces Involved ==
=== US 24th Infantry Division ===
[[File:KumRiver Howitzer.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A group of soldiers readying a large gun in some brush.|A US howitzer position near the Kum River, July 15.]]
The 24th Infantry Division's three infantry regiments, which had a wartime strength of 3,000, were already below strength on their deployment, and heavy losses in the preceding two weeks had reduced their numbers further. The 21st Infantry had 1,100 men left, having suffered 1,433 casualties.<ref name="Fehr88"/> The 34th Infantry had only 2,020 and the 19th had 2,276 men. Another 2,007 men stood in the 24th Infantry Division artillery formations.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=122}}</ref> These counts placed the division's total strength at 11,400.<ref name="Var4"/> This was severely reduced from the 15,965 men and 4,773 vehicles that had arrived in Korea at the beginning of the month.<ref name="Apple59"/> Each of the regiments had only two battalions of infantry as opposed to the normal three.<ref name="Var4"/> Large numbers of men had to be pulled from the lines for [[combat fatigue]].<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=125}}</ref> Morale was extremely low for the soldiers, who were exhausted from days without sleep.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=147}}</ref> Casualties among the division's [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officers]] were extremely high, forcing younger officers and [[non-commissioned officers]] to take leadership positions normally occupied by more experienced ones.<ref>{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=85}}</ref>

In addition to casualties, shortages of equipment hampered the 24th Infantry Division's efforts. Losses in earlier fighting reduced artillery support to two battalions.<ref name="Fehr92">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=92}}</ref> Communications equipment, weapons, and ammunition was largely absent, large amounts of equipment had been lost or destroyed in previous engagements. Most of the radios available to the division did not work, and batteries, communication wire, and telephones to communicate among units were in short supply, with some [[Company (military unit)|company formations]] having only one radio for one [[squad]].<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|p=123}}</ref> The division had no tanks: its new [[M26 Pershing]] and older [[M4 Sherman|M4A3 Sherman]] tanks were still ''en route''. One of the few weapons that could penetrate the North Korean T-34, [[High Explosive Anti Tank|high explosive anti-tank]] ammunition, was in short supply.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=93}}</ref> The paucity of radios and wire hampered communication between and among the American units.<ref name="Fehrenbach 2001 89">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=89}}</ref> 

=== North Korean units ===
North Korean planners intended for three divisions to attack Taejon from three directions, supported by heavy armor. The [[3rd Division (North Korea)|North Korean 3rd Division]] was ordered to attack from the north, against the flank. The [[4th Division (North Korea)|North Korean 4th Division]] would attack across the [[Kum River]] from the east and south, in order to envelop Taejon and the US 24th Infantry Division with it.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=96}}</ref> Eventually they would also be supported by elements of the [[105th Armored Division (North Korea)|North Korean 105th Armored Division]]. Although the [[2nd Infantry Division (North Korea)|North Korean 2nd Infantry Division]] was ordered to attack from [[Cheongju|Chongju]] against the American right flank, it was slow to move and arrived too late to participate in the battle.<ref name="Sum269"/>

The North Koreans advanced on the town with the 3rd and 4th Divisions supported by over 50 [[T-34]] tanks. Each North Korean division, normally operating with 11,000 men, was at 60 to 80 percent strength, giving them nearly a two to one numerical superiority over the American forces.<ref name="Fehr88">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=88}}</ref> Morale of the two divisions was low, owing to repeated air attacks on equipment and overall exhaustion from continuous combat. [[Political commissar|Political officer]]s promised the divisions they would be able to rest in Taejon after they took the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=134}}</ref>

== Battle ==
=== First North Korean attack ===
[[File:Battle of Kum River 14Jul1950b.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Map of the US 34th Infantry Regiment's defense at the Kum River|alt=A map illustrating the contents at this section]]
On the morning of July 14, American soldiers from 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry on the heights {{convert|2|mi|km}} above the Kum River spotted T-34s across the river. The T-34s fired on the 3rd Battalion's position from across the river, to no effect. By mid-morning, North Korean infantry were spotted crossing the river by boat and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] and [[artillery]] fire began hitting the 34th Infantry's lines. In the confusion and poor communication, the North Korean infantry managed to move around the American lines.<ref name="Fehrenbach 2001 89"/> The 1st Battalion, further north, also came under heavy attack by advancing North Korean forces, and though it repulsed the attack with the help of artillery, it was forced to withdraw to safer positions.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=97}}</ref>

In the early afternoon, the North Koreans captured an outpost of the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion, supporting the 34th Infantry with 105-mm [[Howitzer]] guns. They turned a captured machine gun on the battalion's HQ battery and began to fire, taking it by surprise. Artillery fire aimed at the battery destroyed communications and vehicles, and inflicted heavy casualties.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=127}}</ref> Its survivors retreated on foot to the south. Meanwhile, only {{convert|250|yd}} away, A Battery of the battalion also came under attack by 100 North Korean infantrymen, resulting in similar casualties and retreat. B Battery was attacked by 400 North Koreans, but an advance of [[South Korean]] horse cavalry spared the battery from heavy losses, allowing it to make an organized retreat.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=128}}</ref> The 63rd Field Artillery lost all of its guns and 80 of its vehicles, many still intact for North Korean forces to seize.<ref>{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=90}}</ref> 

Later in the evening, 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry counterattacked the positions but was unable to take them back, suffering machine gun and small arms fire, and was forced to withdraw by nightfall.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=129}}</ref> After this failed attempt to retake the equipment, Dean ordered the positions where the captured equipment was located to be destroyed by an [[airstrike]].<ref name="Fehr91">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=91}}</ref> With the 1st Battalion having taken heavy casualties and the 3rd Battalion forced to move to counter North Korean attacks, the northwest flank of the American line had been beaten back.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=98}}</ref> The North Korean 4th Division began crossing the river, only slightly impeded by US aircraft attacking its boats on the river.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=131}}</ref>

=== Second North Korean attack ===

Following the initial penetration, the collapsed 34th Infantry line moved south to [[Nonsan]]. The 19th Infantry moved its 2nd Battalion to fill some of the gaps left by the 34th. There, it was reinforced by South Korean troops from the [[Republic of Korea Army]]. The combined forces observed a large build-up of North Korean troops on the other side of the river. At 0300 on July 16, the North Koreans launched a massive barrage of tank, artillery and mortar fire on the 19th Infantry positions and North Korean troops began to cross the river in boats.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=135}}</ref> The North Korean forces gathered on the west bank and assaulted the positions of 1st Battalion's C and E Companies, followed by a second landing against B Company.<ref>{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=93}}</ref> North Korean forces pushed against the entire battalion, threatening to overwhelm it. The regimental commander ordered all support troops and officers to the line and they were able to repulse the assault. However, in the melee, North Korean forces infiltrated their rear elements, attacking the reserve forces and blocking supply lines. Stretched thin, the 19th Infantry was unable to hold the line at the Kum River and simultaneously repel the North Korean forces.<ref>{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=94}}</ref>

[[File:19th Kum River Map2.JPG|thumb|left|Map of the US 19th Infantry Regiment's defense at the Kum River|alt=A map illustrating the contents at this section]]
That evening, 2nd Battalion was moved to attempt to deal with the North Koreans in the rear but suffered casualties as well, and was unable to break the roadblocks. By July 17, the 19th Infantry withdrew, and was ordered {{convert|25|mi|km}} southwest to regroup and re-equip. Less than half of 1st Battalion returned, and only two of 2nd Battalion's companies remained intact. All three regiments of the 24th Infantry Division, having each been defeated and overwhelmed, were down to battalion-strength formations.<ref>{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=96}}</ref> The division's 19th and 34th Regiments had engaged the North Korean 3rd Infantry Division and the North Korean 4th Infantry Division<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=79}}</ref> between July 13 and July 16 and suffered 650 casualties among the 3,401 men committed there.<ref name="Var4"/> On July 18, the Eighth Army Commander, [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Walton Walker]], ordered William Dean  to hold Taejon until the 20th so that the 1st Cavalry Division and 25th Infantry Division could establish defensive lines along the [[Naktong River]], forming the Pusan Perimeter.<ref name="Fehrenbach, p. 97">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=97}}</ref>

=== Taejon surrounded ===
[[File:General Dean's Kill!.jpg|thumb|A T-34 knocked out by General Dean on July 20|alt=Soldiers stand around a destroyed tank with writing on it reading "Knocked out 20 July 1950 with the supervision of Maj. Gen. W.F. Dean".]]
The North Koreans then moved against Taejon. On July 19, North Korean forces entered Taejon, the site of the 24th Infantry Division's headquarters.<ref>{{harvnb|Malkasian|2001|p=23}}</ref> The North Korean 3rd Division formed a roadblock between Taejon and [[Okchon]], cutting off the 21st Infantry in its reserve positions. The 21st Infantry would subsequently be unable to join the fight.<ref name="Sum268"/> However it would attempt to hold the route of escape for the rest of the division during most of the fight at Taejon.<ref>{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=20}}</ref> At the same time, tanks from the North Korean 105th Armored Division began to enter the city, followed by troops of the 3rd and 4th Infantry Divisions.<ref name="Sum269">{{harvnb|Summers|2001|p=269}}</ref> There, the North Korean forces spread out, occupying key buildings throughout the city to establish sniper positions. American attacks against these positions later set fire to many of Taejon's wooden buildings.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=99}}</ref> North Korean forces first attacked American gun emplacements, food stores, and ammunition dumps, having received information on the location of these facilities through agents operating in the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=21}}</ref> 

At Taejon, the battered 24th Infantry Division was ordered to make a stand.<ref>{{harvnb|Malkasian|2001|p=24}}</ref> The 34th Infantry also moved to the city to oppose the North Korean forces, which assaulted it head-on while attempting to flank and cut off retreat from the rear. Dean began ordering elements of the division, including much of his headquarters, to retreat via train to Taegu, although he remained behind.<ref name="Fehrenbach, p. 97"/> By this time, several [[M24 Chaffee]] light tanks had been sent to re-enforce the division from A Company of the 78th Tank Battalion.<ref name="Sum268">{{harvnb|Summers|2001|p=268}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=103}}</ref> Regardless of the additional tanks, on July 20, North Korean armored units pushed American forces back from the Taejon Airfield, several miles northwest of Taejon, overwhelming the last American units defending the Kum River and forcing the remnants of the division into Taejon itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Summers|2001|p=267}}</ref>
[[File:William F. Dean.jpg|thumb|150px|left|William F. Dean, commander of the 24th Infantry Division during the fight at Taejon |alt=A Caucasian man in his late 50s with gray hair in a military uniform.]]
For two days, the 34th Infantry fought the advancing North Koreans in bitter house-to-house fighting. North Korean soldiers continued to infiltrate the city, often disguised as farmers. The remaining elements of the 24th Infantry Division were pushed back block-by-block.<ref name="Alex102"/> Without radios, and unable to communicate with the remaining elements of the division, Dean joined the men on the front lines, hunting the T-34 tanks with the help of the new shaped-charge, armor-piercing [[bazooka#Korean War|3.5 inch "Super Bazookas"]], which had only been in production since two weeks before the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|pp=94, 98}}</ref> At least a dozen North Korean tanks were destroyed.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=100}}</ref> Large columns of North Korean forces began marching on the city from the south roads, reinforcing those that had crossed the river. American forces pulled back after suffering heavy losses, allowing the North Korean 3rd and 4th Divisions to move on the city freely from the north, south, and east roads.<ref name="Alex102">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=102}}</ref>  The 34th Infantry Division repeatedly attempted to establish its defensive lines, and were repeatedly pushed back by the numerically superior North Koreans.<ref name="Var4"/>

=== Taejon falls ===
At the end of July 20, Dean ordered the headquarters of the 34th Infantry to withdraw. His command was reinforced by several more light tanks from the 1st Cavalry Division. As the tanks fought through a North Korean roadblock, Dean, with a small force of soldiers, followed them.<ref>{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=99}}</ref> At the edge of the city, the final elements of the 34th Infantry, leaving the city in 50 vehicles, were ambushed and many of their vehicles were destroyed by machine guns and mortars, forcing the Americans to retreat on foot.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=104}}</ref> In the ensuing fight, Dean's [[jeep]] made a wrong turn and was separated from the rest of the American forces.<ref>{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=84}}</ref> Unable to turn back, Dean and his party attempted to retreat to American lines on their own, but 35 days later, alone and lost in the hills, Dean was captured by North Korean forces.<ref>{{harvnb|Ecker|2004|p=7}}</ref> For most of his incarceration, the North Koreans were not aware of his rank. Dean repeatedly attempted to make the North Koreans kill him for fear of divulging information under torture. Eventually his rank was uncovered, but they were unable to force any intelligence from him.<ref name="Fehr100">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=100}}</ref> 

When the last of the 34th Infantry's defenders left the city, the 21st Infantry, which had been protecting the road to Taegu, also withdrew, leaving Taejon in the hands of the North Korean forces.<ref name="Alexander, p. 107">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=107}}</ref> By the end of the fight, the Americans counted 922 men killed and 228 wounded with almost 2,400 missing, most of these men from the 34th Infantry.<ref>{{harvnb|Ecker|2004|p=6}}</ref> Evidence suggests that the North Koreans executed some of the missing and captured prisoners immediately after the battle.<ref>{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=22}}</ref> North Korean casualties could not be estimated due to lack of communications between units during the battle, which limited the value of American [[signals intelligence]].<ref name="Var3"/><ref name="Alexander, p. 107"/>

==Aftermath==
Although badly mauled, the 24th Infantry Division accomplished its mission of delaying North Korean forces from advancing until July 20.<ref name="Fehr103"/><ref name="Alex105"/> By that time, American forces had set up a defensive perimeter along the Naktong River and Taegu to the southeast, known as the Pusan Perimeter. On July 22, the 24th Infantry Division was relieved by the 1st Cavalry Division. It was put under the command of Major General [[John H. Church]], in the absence of Dean, whose whereabouts were unknown. After three weeks of fighting, the Division had suffered almost 30 percent casualties.<ref name="Fehr101"/> Historians attribute the substantial tactical losses of the 24th Infantry division to a lack of training, equipment, and readiness, owing to extended time spent on occupation duty in Japan and without training.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=180}}</ref> North Korean casualties are difficult to estimate, owing to the breakdown in communication among units on both sides during the battle. North Korean armor is known to have suffered heavier casualties. A total of 15-20 North Korean tanks were destroyed by anti-tank weapons and US aircraft, and North Korean prisoners estimated 15 76-mm guns, six 122-mm mortars, and 200 artillerymen were killed. Losses among North Korean infantry were apparently light.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=179}}</ref>

Although the cost was high, the 24th Infantry Division's efforts allowed establishment of the strategically important Pusan Perimeter.<ref name="Fehr101">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=101}}</ref> By the time the battle ended, the United Nations had moved enough forces onto the Korean Peninsula to roughly equal the number of attacking North Korean forces.<ref name="Fehr103">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=103}}</ref> For its delaying actions in and around Taejon, the 24th Infantry Division was awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] and the [[Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation]].<ref name="Sum269"/> The Division went into reserve status while it rested and rebuilt, and the first unit of the division back into action, the 19th Infantry Regiment, moved to the front lines of the Pusan Perimeter on August 1.<ref name="Var4"/>

The first two [[Medals of Honor]] for the Korean War were awarded for the battle of Taejon.<ref>{{harvnb|Ecker|2004|p=8}}</ref> For his actions on the front lines, Dean was awarded the first Medal of Honor, although he remained a prisoner of the North Koreans until the end of the war (released in September 1953).<ref name="Fehr100"/> A second soldier, Sergeant [[George D. Libby]], received the Medal of Honor [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]], for tending to wounded soldiers during the evacuation: he repeatedly passed over shelled roads to help evacuate them.<ref name="Alex105">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=105}}</ref>
