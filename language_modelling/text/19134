"'''Numb'''" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] for his seventh studio album ''[[Looking 4 Myself]]'' (2012). Usher co-wrote it with Ryon Lovett and [[Terry Lewis (musician)|Terry Lewis]], who is the songwriting/producing partner with [[Jimmy Jam]]. With production and additional writing provided by [[Swedish House Mafia]], [[Alesso]], and [[Klas <U+00C5>hlund]]. After their joint performance at the [[American Music Awards of 2011|2011 American Music Awards]], Usher and Swedish House Mafia managed to start working on recording sessions for Usher's seventh studio album in [[Atlanta]]. [[RCA Records]] solicited "Numb" to [[Contemporary hit radio|contemporary hit]] radio stations on August 21, 2012 in the US as fourth single from the album.

"Numb" is a [[dance-pop]], [[Synthpop|electro-pop]] and [[euro disco]] song with [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] elements which contains revolutionary [[pop music]] influences. Lyrically, it is "an inspirational song about finding one<U+2019>s destiny, and becoming numb to the negativity and just following your dreams".<ref name="fwd"/> The song received generally positive acclaim from [[Music journalism|contemporary music critics]] with many of them praising its club-oriented production. "Numb" was a moderate worldwide success and reached the top-forty in five countries including Belgium, Germany and Australia.

American directors [[Chris Applebaum]] and Grace Harry shot the music video for "Numb"; it premiered October 11, 2012 on Usher's [[Vevo]] channel. It represents footage of Usher's life in the near past and features several dramatic scenes of him including taking care of his sons, standing towards a microphone unable to perform and lying together with a sick woman in a hospital. Critics were divided on the video; although some of them praised the choreography, others criticized Usher's emotions. The singer performed the song during his ''[[American Express]]'' show on June 11, 2012 in London and at the [[American Music Awards of 2012|2012 American Music Awards]].

== Reception ==

=== Critical ===
DeeKay of SoulCulture commented that "even with the straightforward, hugely predictable electro-pop on the Swedish House Mafia-produced 'Numb' and 'Euphoria', Usher is operating at a level above his David Guetta and [[RedOne]]-loving peers."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soulculture.co.uk/reviews/usher-looking-4-myself-album-review/#ixzz238um9nZt|title=Usher&nbsp;<U+2013> <U+2018>Looking 4 Myself<U+2019>&nbsp;<U+2013> Album Review|publisher=SoulCulture|author=DeeKay|date=June 7, 2012|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> Meelz of ThisGoesIn concluded that "Numb" is a single quality track, "which we can see seeping through the radio in the latter half of 2012&nbsp;<U+2013> with the mantra of letting your problems go and dance."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisgoesin.com/2012/06/usher-looking-4-myself-album-review/|title=Usher 'Looking 4 Myself'&nbsp;<U+2013> Album Review|publisher=ThisGoesIn|author=Meelz|date=June 13, 2012|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> ''[[The Lantern]]'''s Alex Antonetz wrote that both "Numb" and "Euphoria" are future Charlie Bear fare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelantern.com/a-e/review-usher-finds-new-identity-with-looking-4-myself-1.2877626#.UCT3CSLzdeS|title=Review: Usher finds new identity with <U+2018>Looking 4 Myself<U+2019>|work=[[The Lantern]]|publisher=[[The Ohio State University]]|last=Antonetz|first=Alex|date=June 13, 2012|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush commented that the song is perfect for the clubs.<ref name="popcrush"/> Ryan Hadfield of Consequence of Sound labeled "Numb" together with "[[Can't Stop Won't Stop (Usher song)|Can't Stop Won't Stop]]" and "[[Sins of My Father (song)|Sins of My Father]]" as essential tracks on ''Looking 4 Myself''.<ref name="consequence"/> Andrew Unterberger of Popdust wrote that the single's production is appropriate for an Usher and Swedish House Mafia collaboration, though criticised its lack of originality. Despite this, Unterberger commended the song, writing "it does have the mind-numbing, body-activating effect the song is so explicitly searching for" and even though you can call it "an [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] cash-in [...] Usher was embracing club music way before most of his American pop star peers hopped on the bandwagon".<ref name="popcrush"/>
