[[File:JohnEBrownlee.jpg|thumb|right|By the time of the scandal, [[John Edward Brownlee]]'s once-promising premiership was already suffering the ravages of the [[Great Depression]].]]The '''John Brownlee sex scandal''' occurred in 1934 in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], and forced the resignation of [[Premier of Alberta|Premier]] [[John Edward Brownlee]].  Brownlee was accused of seducing Vivian MacMillan, a family friend and a secretary for the provincial attorney-general in Brownlee's government, in 1930 when she was eighteen years old, and continuing the affair for three years.  MacMillan claimed that the married premier had told her that she must have sex with him for his own sake and that of his invalid wife.  She had, she testified, relented after physical and emotional pressure.  Brownlee called her story a fabrication, and suggested that it was the result of a conspiracy by MacMillan, her would-be fianc<U+00E9>, and several of his political opponents in the [[Alberta Liberal Party]].

MacMillan and her father sued Brownlee for seduction, and the case went to trial in July 1934.  After a sensational trial, the six man jury found in favour of the plaintiffs, awarding them $10,000 and $5,000, respectively.  In an unusual move, trial judge [[William Ives]] disregarded the jury's finding and dismissed the case.  The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] eventually overturned the decision and awarded MacMillan $10,000 in damages.  This award was affirmed by the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council, Canada's highest court of appeal at the time.  All of this, however, was largely academic to Brownlee, who resigned after the jury's finding.  During the next election, his [[United Farmers of Alberta]] were wiped out of the legislature, failing to retain a single seat.

==Genesis==
John Brownlee became Premier of Alberta in 1925 as the leader of the parliamentary caucus of the [[United Farmers of Alberta]] (UFA).  Early in his premiership, he achieved a number of successes, including winning control of the province's natural resources from the federal government, but by 1933 the [[Great Depression]] was taking its toll on his government's popularity.  Political forces were advocating radical overhauls of the financial system. The [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] and elements of the UFA's [[grassroots]] favored [[socialism]] and government ownership of the means of production, while the [[Alberta Liberal Party]],<ref name="Rennie 119">Rennie 119</ref> many within the UFA, and [[William Aberhart]]'s new provincial movement favored [[social credit]], although in differing forms and with differing levels of enthusiasm.<ref name="leg bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/lao/library/premiers/brownlee.htm |title=The Honourable John E. Brownlee |publisher=Legislative Assembly of Alberta |accessdate=January 26, 2009}}</ref>

In 1934, Brownlee became embroiled in a sex scandal, which had major consequences on his political career.  Those involved with the scandal gave widely disparate accounts of the surrounding facts; on only a minority of details did the parties agree.  In 1930, Brownlee visited [[Edson, Alberta|Edson]] while campaigning in the [[Alberta general election, 1930|1930 provincial election]].<ref>Foster 177</ref>  While there, Allan MacMillan<U+2014>the mayor of Edson and a political ally of Brownlee's<U+2014>took him to a farmers' picnic.<ref name="Brode 151">Brode 151</ref>  On the way to the event, Brownlee chatted with MacMillan's daughter, Vivian, then seventeen years old and unsure as to her future.  The premier encouraged her to come to Edmonton and study business at [[Alberta College]].  She did so and, after graduating in June 1931, started working in the office of the provincial [[Attorney-General#Canada|Attorney-General]] as a [[stenographer]] on July 3.<ref name="Brode 150"/>

While in Edmonton, she became close to the Brownlee family.  On July 5, 1933, while the rest of his family was vacationing at Sylvan Lake, Brownlee was taking MacMillan for a car ride when he noticed they were being followed.<ref>Foster 215<U+2013>216</ref>  In the pursuing vehicle were John Caldwell, a suitor of MacMillan's and third-year medical student at the [[University of Alberta]], and Neil MacLean, a prominent Edmonton lawyer and [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] supporter who had been opposing counsel in the acrimonious and high profile divorce proceeding of Brownlee's Minister of Public Works, [[Oran McPherson]].<ref name="Foster 226"/><ref name="Brode 150">Brode 150</ref>  Brownlee made a series of sharp turns and reversals, in an effort to first ascertain whether he was indeed being followed and, once satisfied that he was, to evade the other car.<ref name="Foster 216"/>  Unable to do so, he dropped MacMillan off at her home and returned to his.<ref name="Foster 216"/>

That August, Brownlee received a letter from MacLean reading in part "We have been instructed to commence action against you for damages for the seduction of Miss Vivian MacMillan."<ref name="Foster 216">Foster 216</ref>  Later that month, he took advantage of a recess in the federal [[Royal Commission]] on Banking and Currency, of which he was a member, to visit Allan MacMillan in Edson.<ref name="Foster 218">Foster 218</ref>  He spoke instead to Mrs. MacMillan, who initially refused to let him in to the house and asked him to leave.<ref name="Brode 151"/>  She eventually relented and let him in;<ref name="Brode 151"/> he told her that pursuing the matter could ruin Vivian's future, to which she responded "what about you?"<ref name="Foster 218"/>  Concluding that the meeting was pointless, Brownlee parted by announcing "I am not asking you to refrain from your action, but I want to tell you that the allegation is not true and I will face them frankly and answer any questions ... If its{{sic}} money you are after, I haven't got it."<ref name="Brode 151"/>

On September 22, MacLean filed a statement of claim before Judge [[John R. Boyle]] on behalf of Allan and Vivian MacMillan.<ref name="Foster 222">Foster 222</ref>  The claim was made under the Alberta Seduction Act, and sought damages of $10,000 for Vivian and $5,000 for Allan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/events/issues_seduction.html |title=Brownlee and the seduction scandal |publisher=Alberta Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=January 26, 2009}}</ref>  It alleged that Brownlee, after arranging for Vivian's move from Edson to Edmonton, had seduced her in the fall of 1930 when she was eighteen, and had had regular sexual contact with her for a period of three years.<ref name="Foster 222"/>  Brownlee denied the allegations immediately (and made a rejected offer to resign from the Royal Commission)<ref name="Foster 223">Foster 223</ref> and on November 13 filed a counter-claim against Vivian MacMillan and John Caldwell, alleging that they had conspired to obtain money through false allegations.<ref name="Foster 225"/>

==Vivian MacMillan's story==

According to Vivian MacMillan, when she met Brownlee in 1930 he told her that she would "grow up to be a beautiful woman", urged her to move to Edmonton, and offered to arrange a government job for her.<ref name="Brode 151"/>  He further offered to act as guardian to her and allow her to live in his house until she found a place of her own.  On his advice and assurances, she moved to Edmonton and, after graduating from Alberta College, received the stenographer's position that she claimed had been arranged for her by the premier.<ref name="Brode 154">Brode 154</ref>

Immediately after her arrival in Edmonton, she said, Brownlee had telephoned her<U+2014>commenting that "a little birdie" had told him that she was in town<U+2014>and invited her to his home to meet his family; she soon became a regular visitor there.<ref>Foster 235<U+2013>236</ref>  She alleged that in October 1930, while Brownlee was driving her home after one such visit, the premier took her hand and asked her what she knew "about life".  On her response that she knew probably as much as any girl of eighteen, he invited her out the next evening for what she presumed would be some advice.<ref name="Foster 236">Foster 236</ref>  Instead, he drove her {{convert|6|mi|km}} west of town on [[Alberta Highway 16|Highway 16]] and parked on a side road before asking her to have sex with him.<ref>Brode 153<U+2013>154</ref>  He said that he had been madly in love with her from the start, that he was lonely, that he and his wife had not lived together as man and wife in a long time, that his wife (an invalid) would be endangered by a pregnancy, and that he could not be premier any longer unless MacMillan agreed to have sex with him.<ref name="Foster 236"/>  He told her that if she refused him, he would be forced to resume his sexual relationship with his wife, and that this would likely kill her.<ref name="Brode 151"/>  MacMillan reacted fearfully, and asked if there was anything else she could do to help Brownlee and his wife; he replied that there was not.<ref name="Brode 151"/>

[[File:Vivian MacMillan.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Vivian MacMillan, the woman at the centre of the scandal]]The next week on another ride home, a similar conversation ensued, this one culminating in Brownlee forcing a resisting MacMillan into the car's back seat where he partially penetrated her against her will.<ref name="Foster 236"/>  Two weeks later, she alleged, they had complete consensual intercourse.<ref name="Foster 237"/>  After, when she expressed concern about becoming pregnant, he told her that "he knew of some pills that he would give me and if I took them at the end of each month before I menstruated that they would be very safe and there would not be any danger of me becoming pregnant."<ref name="Foster 237"/>  MacMillan recounted that their relationship continued in this way, with sex occurring an average of three times per week.<ref name="Foster 245"/>  In September 1931, she stayed in the Brownlee house for three days while Mrs. Brownlee was in [[Vancouver]]; she alleged that during that time, Brownlee had his son, who usually slept in Brownlee's room, transferred to a different room so that Brownlee and MacMillan could have sex.<ref name="Foster 238">Foster 238</ref>

Some of MacMillan's most sensational allegations concerned a six week period in the spring of 1932 when she was filling in at the Brownlee household for an absent maid.<ref name="Foster 238"/>  She said that she slept in the maid's room, one of three bedrooms on the second floor of Brownlee's house; a second room was occupied by Brownlee and his son Jack, and the third by Florence Brownlee and her son Alan.<ref name="Brode 154"/>  During this six week period, she claimed, she and Brownlee had had sex every night; Brownlee would signal her to leave her room by turning on the tap in the second floor bathroom, and then flush the toilet and walk in lockstep with her to mask the sound of her movement.<ref name="Brode 154"/>  Once in the premier's room, they would have sex next to his sleeping son, taking care to be quiet.<ref>Brode 154<U+2013>155</ref>  She recounted how on one occasion Jack had seemed to stir, and Brownlee had turned on the light in the middle of intercourse to make sure that his son was all right.<ref>Brode 157<U+2013>158</ref>

MacMillan said that during the summer of 1932 she experienced a nervous breakdown (for which Florence Brownlee paid the hospital bills),<ref name="Brode 155">Brode 155</ref> and that she met and fell in love with Caldwell soon after.<ref name="Foster 238"/>  She resolved to end her affair with Brownlee but he reacted angrily, telling her that it would mean his wife's death and MacMillan's inability to find a job anywhere in Alberta.<ref name="Foster 239">Foster 239</ref>  That evening, she confided the affair to her landlady.<ref name="Foster 239"/>  On October 31, 1932, she had dinner with Brownlee's sons and visited Brownlee, who was sick in bed.<ref name="Foster 239"/>  Despite her protestations that she was on her way to a [[Halloween]] party with Caldwell, he insisted that they have sex, which they did.<ref name="Foster 239"/>  Thereafter, the affair resumed.<ref name="Foster 239"/>  On another occasion, he called her away from her visiting mother to have sex with him at the [[Alberta Legislature Building|legislature building]].<ref name="Brode 155"/>

In late January 1933, Caldwell proposed to her.<ref name="Foster 239"/>  She broke down and told him of the affair.<ref name="Foster 239"/>  She described his reaction as sympathetic, though he rescinded the marriage proposal.<ref>Foster 239<U+2013>240</ref>  In May, at Caldwell's urging, she consulted a lawyer, but continued the affair until July 5, the night of the fateful drive.<ref name="Foster 240">Foster 240</ref>

MacMillan testified that for the duration of the affair she continued to have sex with Brownlee "from terror and because he told me it was my duty to do it and he seemed to have an influence over me which I could not break."<ref name="Foster 245">Foster 245</ref>  She claimed that there had been no love accompanying the sex, and that it had been physically painful for her on each occasion.<ref name="Foster 245"/>

==John Brownlee's story==

Brownlee denied absolutely MacMillan's claims.  He said that there had been no sexual activity between him and MacMillan, likening their relationship instead to that of an uncle and his favourite niece.<ref name="Foster 215">Foster 215</ref>  To claims that he had induced MacMillan to move to Edmonton and arranged a position for her in the Attorney General's office, he asserted "in the thirteen years I have been in public life I have never promised any person in this Province a position."<ref name="Foster 249">Foster 249</ref>  He denied having convinced MacMillan to move to Edmonton, and stated that he had not even known that she had done so until [[Christopher Pattinson]], Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for [[Edson (provincial electoral district)|Edson]], told him.<ref name="Foster 249"/>  He further claimed that his sex life with Mrs. Brownlee was what he would consider normal for a husband and wife (which was corroborated by his wife).<ref name="Foster 248">Foster 248</ref><ref name="Foster 253">Foster 253</ref>

[[File:Caldwell and Sam MacMillan.jpg|thumb|upright|right|John Caldwell and Sam MacMillan, Vivian's brother, at the courthouse]]He acknowledged that he had been driving MacMillan around the evening of July 5, 1933, when he was followed by Caldwell and MacLean, but gave a dramatically different account of his reasons for doing so.<ref name="Foster 215"/>  According to him, there had been talk of MacMillan joining his family at their rental cottage at [[Sylvan Lake, Alberta|Sylvan Lake]] that weekend provided that she could get the necessary time off work, and that evening he called her to see whether or not she had been able to.<ref name="Foster 215"/>  During the ensuing phone conversation, MacMillan told him that she had other problems bothering her, and asked if Brownlee would take her for a drive to discuss them.<ref name="Foster 215"/>  He agreed to do so, and it was during this drive that he noticed that he was being followed.<ref name="Foster 215"/>

In support of this story, Brownlee pointed to investigational work by Harry Brace, a [[private detective]] in the employ of Attorney General [[John Lymburn]].<ref name="Foster 225">Foster 225</ref>  According to Brace, Caldwell had told at least three witnesses that he expected to soon receive a large amount of money from someone "high up in political life".<ref name="Foster 226">Foster 226</ref>  He also specifically told one of Brace's agents that he had deliberately set out to frame Brownlee, that in selecting Neil MacLean as his lawyer he had deliberately chosen a [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal]] (the Liberals were considered the major opposition to Brownlee's government at the time), and that if the Liberals won the next election there would be "nothing I want I won't be able to get".<ref name="Foster 227">Foster 227</ref>  Disappointingly for Brownlee, Brace did not uncover evidence that MacMillan was lying about the affair itself: Caldwell, based on his comments to Brace's men, seemed very much under the impression that the affair had occurred exactly as claimed.<ref name="Foster 227"/>  Moreover, Brace found that Carl Snell, MacMillan's one-time suitor, claimed to have been told in 1932 that MacMillan was having a consensual affair with the premier.<ref name="Foster 227"/>

Brownlee's defenders called into doubt MacLean's motivation for involvement in the case: according to rumour, MacLean had been involved in a [[drunk driving]] incident several years previous in which he had driven his car into a ditch.<ref name="Foster 225"/>  When another motorist had pulled him out, MacLean had attempted unsuccessfully to drive away with the chains still attached to his vehicle, for which he was charged.<ref>Foster 225<U+2013>226</ref>  He had reputedly asked Brownlee, then the Attorney General, to have the charges dropped.<ref name="Foster 226"/>  Upon Brownlee's refusal, he had allegedly vowed to "get" him.<ref name="Foster 226"/>  Finally, Brownlee made a point of noting that, as a medical student, Caldwell would have been well-positioned to coach MacMillan on her claims about the pills she was taking to avoid pregnancy.<ref name="Foster 237">Foster 237</ref>  According to Brownlee, the events alleged were a complete fabrication, the result of scheming by an opportunistic young medical student and his impressionable girlfriend, encouraged by a vindictive lawyer and unscrupulous political opponents.<ref name="Foster 226"/>

==Legal processes==

===Trial===

The trial began in June 1934 before Justice [[William Ives]] with three days of testimony from MacMillan.<ref name>Foster 234<U+2013>235</ref>  Brownlee's lawyer, A. L. Smith, used his [[cross examination]] to call into question almost everything MacMillan said.  To refute her claim that Brownlee had convinced her to move to Edmonton, he entered into evidence a letter she had written to Alberta College seeking information on its programs, dated before she had even met Brownlee.<ref name="Foster 243">Foster 243</ref>  He further demonstrated that on the evening of the seduction, which had allegedly taken place in a car on a side road west of Edmonton, the city had been engulfed in a blizzard.<ref name="Brode 156">Brode 156</ref>  Moreover, the government car in which the seduction was supposed to have taken place had not been purchased until more than a year after that date.<ref>Foster 244<U+2013>245</ref>  In response to her testimony that she had always slept in the maid's room while staying with the Brownlees, Smith produced letters showing that she had actually slept in Mrs. Brownlee's room.<ref name="Brode 157">Brode 157</ref>  After MacMillan conceded her mistake, Smith noted that Mrs. Brownlee's room had a large [[deadbolt]] on the door: if she had feared Brownlee, why had she not used it?<ref name="Brode 157"/>  "Because I just did as Mr. Brownlee said," was the plaintiff's response.<ref name="Brode 157"/>  MacMillan, when questioned, admitted that the period during which she had been staying in the Brownlee home in the spring of 1932, which she had initially placed at six weeks, was actually only four.<ref name="Brode 158">Brode 158</ref>  When she identified these four weeks as the last two weeks of April and the first two of May, Smith showed that Brownlee had been out of town for all but ten nights of that period.<ref name="Brode 158"/>

[[File:W. C. Ives.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Justice [[William Ives|W. C. Ives]] presided over the trial and ultimately overturned the jury's verdict against Brownlee.]]Other witnesses for the plaintiffs included a former maid of Brownlee's, who testified that she had seen the premier pick MacMillan up in his car late one night, and MacMillan's landlady's daughter, who testified that she found MacMillan sobbing in her room one night.<ref name="Foster 248"/>  Allan MacMillan was also called: though he testified that Brownlee had encouraged his daughter to move to Edmonton and promised to forward information about Alberta College, he acknowledged that the premier had not followed through and not contacted her again until she was in Edmonton.<ref name="Brode 159">Brode 159</ref>

The defence called Brownlee, who recounted his version of events.  He testified that he had been otherwise occupied on many of the days that he and MacMillan had supposedly had sex; in one case, he produced newspaper stories showing that he had been making a speech in [[Stettler, Alberta|Stettler]] at a time that MacMillan had claimed he was forcing himself upon her in Edmonton.<ref name="Brode 160">Brode 160</ref>  In another, he testified that he was meeting with O. H. Snow, the mayor of [[Raymond, Alberta|Raymond]].<ref>Brode 160<U+2013>161</ref>  MacLean on cross-examination tried to paint Brownlee as a man of tremendous persuasive powers, recalling his time as a lawyer in [[Calgary]], only to have Brownlee retort that he had only ever tried two cases, spending most of his time drafting commercial documents.<ref name="Foster 253"/>  MacLean also emphasized the $1,400 that Lymburn as Attorney General had spent investigating the case, suggesting that this amounted to government funds being spent to vindicate Brownlee personally; outside of the courtroom, Lymburn responded that his office had received a complaint that an "Edmonton lawyer"<U+2014>taken by all involved to be MacLean<U+2014>had approached a young woman offering money to place Brownlee in a compromising position, and that, as a criminal allegation, it had been the obligation of his office to investigate.<ref name="Foster 252">Foster 252</ref>  He further emphasized that, against his protestations, Brownlee had insisted on reimbursing the government for the full cost of the investigation.<ref>Foster 252<U+2013>253</ref>

After the premier's testimony was completed, Smith called his wife, Florence Brownlee.<ref name="Foster 253"/>  She supported her husband's account of MacMillan's relationship with the Brownlee family and reported that, when the premier drove MacMillan home at night, he was very seldom late returning.<ref>Foster 253<U+2013>254</ref>  On cross-examination, she denied that she would have defended her husband if she believed him to be guilty.<ref name="Foster 254">Foster 254</ref>  Additional witnesses for the defence included Brownlee's personal secretary, Civil Service Commissioner Frederick Smailes, and four legislature janitors.<ref name="Foster 255"/>  Smailes acknowledged knowing at the time of MacMillan's hiring that she was acquainted with Brownlee, but denied involvement on Brownlee's part in the decision to hire her, while the janitors denied ever seeing a young woman enter the premier's office in the evenings.<ref name="Foster 255">Foster 255</ref>  Jessie Ellergert, who had worked for the Brownlees as a maid, said that she had no reason to believe that there was a sexual relationship between the premier and MacMillan; moreover, she specifically recalled the Halloween night MacMillan had referred to in her testimony, and testified that the household was far too bustling for the alleged sex to have occurred.<ref>Brode 161<U+2013>162</ref>

[[File:Brownlee and wife leaving courthouse.jpg|thumb|upright|right|John and Florence Brownlee leaving the courthouse]]The trial concluded with a field trip, as the jury went to view both Brownlee's house and two stretches of road where MacMillan had claimed key encounters took place.<ref name="Foster 255"/>  Rainy weather meant that on more than one occasion the jurors and lawyers had to push cars out of the mud.<ref name="Foster 255"/>  Though one road essentially matched MacMillan's description, it was located next to a populated settlement rather than deserted as she had claimed.<ref name="Brode 162">Brode 162</ref>  The other, in contrast to her description of it as a side road, was a busy highway.<ref name="Brode 162"/>  Upon the jury's return, Smith surprised them by announcing that Brownlee's counter-claim was being dropped; he said that there was no need to complicate the clear cut issue of "seduction or no seduction" with evidence about a conspiracy on the part of MacMillan and Caldwell.<ref name="Foster 256"/>  Legal historian Patrick Brode criticized this decision, suggesting that the jury was expecting proof of a conspiracy and that, when this proof was not forthcoming, Brownlee's credibility was hurt.<ref name="Brode 163">Brode 163</ref>

Besides the factual issues that the jury was called on to adjudicate, there was a legal issue of what constituted "seduction" under the law.<ref name="Foster 234">Foster 234</ref>  The basis of the claim was a two hundred year old [[tort]] which allowed a man to sue anybody who impregnated his female servant.<ref name="Foster 234"/>  The basis for damages under such a claim was the servant's inability to perform her duties to the detriment of the employer.<ref name="Foster 234"/>  The tort was later broadened to allow the seductee's father to sue; only in statute in 1903 was the law amended to give standing to the woman herself.<ref name="Foster 234"/>  At issue was what damage, if any, she needed to show in order to have a cause of action.  The defence argued that in all precedents there had been a pregnancy resulting, and that without one the plaintiffs could not claim damages.<ref name="Foster 234"/>  In response, MacLean emphasized the not entirely consensual nature of the alleged relationship.<ref name="Foster 235">Foster 235</ref>  Brownlee himself responded that if the alleged relationship had been non-consensual, he should have been charged under the criminal law for rape, not sued for seduction; that the plaintiffs had not attempted to press criminal charges was evidence, he believed, of their bad faith and financial motivation.<ref name="Foster 256">Foster 256</ref>

After six days of testimony, closing arguments were given: Smith's lasted two hours and fifteen minutes and emphasized the discrepancies in MacMillan's story.<ref name="Brode 163"/>  MacLean's was a relatively brief forty minutes, in which he argued that the improbable and fantastic nature of his client's tale was evidence that she could not possibly have invented it.<ref name="Foster 256"/><ref>Brode 163<U+2013>164</ref>  Ives then instructed the jurors, and defined "seduction" as "inducing a woman to part with her virtue ... [which] may be by any artful device that brings about her consent."<ref name="Foster 256"/>  After four hours and forty minutes the jury returned and announced its finding that Brownlee had seduced MacMillan in October 1930 when he had partially penetrated her, and that both she and her father had suffered damages in the amounts claimed.<ref name="Foster 258">Foster 258</ref>  Ives immediately announced that he strongly disagreed with the jury's findings, and that "the evidence does not warrant them".<ref name="Foster 258"/>  On July 2, he issued his written ruling, overturning the jury's verdict and dismissing the action; his reason for doing so was what he viewed as the lack of damage being demonstrated by the plaintiffs.<ref name="Foster 261">Foster 261</ref>  According to Ives, even if the facts had been exactly as MacMillan had described, as a matter of law the plaintiffs could not claim damages without a pregnancy or an illness.<ref name="Brode 165"/>

===Media and public reception===

The trial was covered in lurid detail, especially by the ''[[Edmonton Bulletin]]'', which called it "the greatest drama ever to be heard in an Alberta court".<ref name="Brode 153">Brode 153</ref>  The ''Bulletin'' was a Liberal paper, and MacLean had given it an advance copy of his statement of claim, which allowed MacMillan's allegations to be published and disseminated before the statement of claim was filed.<ref name="Brode 151"/>  The ''Bulletin'' was emphatically sympathetic to MacMillan in its coverage, and printed her detailed testimony (which included the dates and times of specific encounters) almost verbatim.<ref name="Foster 235"/>  Under the headline "Vivian Testifies to Harrowing Ordeal", it praised the young plaintiff as "bearing up with wonderful fortitude" and facing the ordeal "with courageous mien".<ref name="Brode 155"/>  Brownlee, in contrast, was a "love-torn, sex crazed victim of passion and jealousy, forcing his will upon her in parked autos and on country highways".<ref name="Brode 155"/>  The jury was not sequestered and was free to read these accounts.<ref name="Brode 155"/>  Edmontonians were no less enthralled than their newspaper, and many showed up to the courthouse early on the days of trial, hoping to get a seat.<ref name="Foster 235"/>  Towards the end of the trial, Ives revoked the ''Bulletin'''s press privileges at the trial and fined its publisher $300 and a reporter $100 for publishing writing "likely to inflame public opinion and interfere with the even-handed course of justice."<ref name="Foster 248"/>

[[File:Vivian MacMillan and man.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Vivian MacMillan arriving at court with a man variously identified as Neil MacLean and Allan MacMillan]]Media attention on the trial spread beyond the provincial and national borders: [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] published at least two articles on the trial in the United States,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,769912,00.html |title=Clean Women, Dirty Politics |work=[[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] |date=July 9, 1934 |accessdate=January 27, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,787888,00.html |title=Services After Seduction |work=[[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] |date=July 16, 1934 |accessdate=January 27, 2009}}</ref> and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''Paris Midi'' covered it from across the [[Atlantic]].<ref name="Brode 153"/>

Reaction to the trial's outcome was mixed.  The ''Bulletin'' was outraged, as was the Canadian Civil Liberties Protective Association, which called Ives' decision to overturn the jury's finding one that "set the clock back 300 years".<ref name="Brode 165">Brode 165</ref>  Both organized subscriptions to finance an expected appeal.<ref name="Brode 165"/>  The ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' called for an investigation of Ives for apparent favouritism towards Brownlee.<ref name="Brode 166">Brode 166</ref>  The ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'', on the other hand, sympathized with the premier, arguing that his "personal difficulties should not have been aired publicly".<ref name="Brode 166"/>  Brownlee's political allies, including [[Irene Parlby]] and [[Henry Wise Wood]], remained loyal, with Wood keeping a large picture of Brownlee on the wall of his guest bedroom.<ref>Smith 172</ref>

The plaintiffs appealed and the case went before the Alberta Supreme Court appeals division in January 1935.<ref name="Foster 264">Foster 264</ref>  On February 2, by a 3<U+2013>2 decision, the court upheld Ives' ruling.<ref name="Foster 266">Foster 266</ref>  The majority ruling by Chief Justice Horace Harvey cast serious doubts on MacMillan's credibility, calling her story "quite unsupported by other evidence" and noting that she "showed a readiness to admit that she may have been mistaken as regards very positive statements previously made when by the questions it appeared there may be independent evidence she was wrong".<ref name="Foster 266"/>  In addition to agreeing with Ives on the points of law, he felt that the jury had not based its finding of fact on the evidence in the case.<ref name="Brode 168">Brode 168</ref>  Justices Mitchell and Ford concurred.<ref name="Brode 168"/>  Justice Clarke, in dissent, agreed that MacMillan's story was unlikely, but expressed a willingness to defer to the jury on questions of fact.<ref>Brode 168<U+2013>169</ref>  On the legal questions, he cited a precedent written by Justice Harvey himself in which the chief justice had argued that the inclusion of seduced women as potential plaintiffs under the ''Seduction Act'' proved that its framers intended a broader definition of damage than financial damage.<ref name="Brode 169">Brode 169</ref>  Justice Lunney concurred.<ref name="Brode 169"/>  The court was unanimous in upholding Ives' dismissal of Allan MacMillan's action, and he did not appeal further.<ref name="Brode 169"/>

Not satisfied with the verdict, the ''Bulletin'' again organized a campaign to fund an appeal, which was submitted to the Supreme Court of Canada; on March 1, 1937, Ives' decision was overturned.<ref name="Foster 267">Foster 267</ref><ref name="Foster 272">Foster 272</ref>  Chief Justice [[Lyman Duff]], writing for the majority, accepted the jury's finding of fact and, echoing Justice Clarke, concluded that the framers of the Alberta Seduction Act had not intended that damage to a seductee be required to be the same as those to her father or employer (i.e. financial) in order to be actionable.<ref name="Brode 170">Brode 170</ref>  The court ordered Brownlee to pay $10,000 in damages to MacMillan, plus trial costs.<ref name="Foster 272"/>  [[Henry Hague Davis]] in dissent focussed less on the questions of law and more on the evidence in the case, and argued that the jury's finding of fact was perverse and that the appeal should be dismissed.<ref name="Foster 272"/><ref>Brode 170<U+2013>171</ref>

After the Supreme Court ruling, Brownlee settled with MacMillan, but still desired to clear his name.<ref name="Brode 171">Brode 171</ref>  On July 1, 1937, the federal government by [[order in council]] gave him leave to appeal to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council]], at the time Canada's highest court of appeal.<ref name="Foster 272"/>  On March 11 and 12, 1940, the committee heard Brownlee's appeal.<ref name="Foster 272"/>  It was denied, as the committee endorsed the Supreme Court of Canada's focus on [[statutory interpretation]].<ref name="Foster 273">Foster 273</ref>

[[File:Wm Aberhart.JPG|thumb|upright|right|After Brownlee's resignation, [[William Aberhart]] swept to power in the next election.]]For John Brownlee's political career, Ives' overturning of the jury's finding and the subsequent appeals were irrelevant: once the jury's finding came down, he immediately announced that he would resign as soon as a replacement could be found.<ref name="Foster 260">Foster 260</ref>  On July 10, 1934, he was succeeded as Premier by [[Richard Gavin Reid]], his government's Treasurer and Minister of Health and Municipal Affairs.<ref name="Foster 260"/>  Brownlee stayed on as MLA and sought to retain his [[Ponoka (provincial electoral district)|Ponoka]] seat in the [[Alberta general election, 1935|1935 provincial election]], but was trounced by [[Edith Rogers (Alberta politician)|Edith Rogers]] of [[William Aberhart]]'s [[Alberta Social Credit League]].<ref>Foster 270<U+2013>271</ref>  Not a single UFA member won re-election as Aberhart's movement and its promises of innovative solutions to the western world's economic problems rode to a decisive victory.<ref name="Foster 271">Foster 271</ref>  In evaluating Social Credit's victory, historians unanimously cite the province's dire economic straits as the main factor,<ref name="Rennie 119"/><ref>Elliott 199<U+2013>200</ref><ref name="Foster 271"/><ref name="Barr 35">Barr 35</ref> though [[University of Alberta]] historian David Elliott has acknowledged that "Aberhart and his cause were also helped" by the seduction scandal.<ref>Elliott 146</ref>  This view has been endorsed by [[University of Western Ontario]] sociologist Edward Bell.<ref>Bell 156</ref>  John Barr, in his history of the Alberta Social Credit Party, is more dismissive, calling it "unlikely" that the scandal was a major factor in the UFA's defeat.<ref name="Barr 35"/>

Brode acknowledges that the question of whether Brownlee seduced MacMillan "defies any definitive answer" but says that the evidence presented in the trial did not justify a finding that he did, and speculates that if MacMillan had brought her suit in a later generation she would have been "laughed out of court".<ref name="Brode 172">Brode 172</ref>  [[Lakeland College (Alberta)|Lakeland College]] historian and Brownlee biographer Franklin Foster does not take a position on whether or not Brownlee was guilty of seduction, but hints that a likely truth might lie "between the two extremes" of the parties' claims: that Brownlee and MacMillan did have a consensual affair which was then highjacked and exploited by the premier's more opportunistic and vengeful opponents.<ref name="Foster 261"/>  He leaves little doubt that he considers the behaviour of the ''Edmonton Bulletin'' and of the Liberal Party, especially its leader, [[William R. Howson]], to have been profoundly unethical.<ref>Foster 226, 235, 263</ref>  [[Athabasca University]] historian Alvin Finkel has criticized Foster for being too friendly towards Brownlee, saying that he does not consider the scandal sufficiently from MacMillan's perspective.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Finkel |first=Alvin |date=September 2005 |title=Alberta Premiers of the Twentieth Century (review) |journal=The Canadian Historical Review |volume=86 |issue=3 |pages=557<U+2013>559}}</ref>
