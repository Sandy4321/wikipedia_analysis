'''McColl<U+2013>Richardson Field at Jerry Richardson Stadium''' is a [[college football]] [[stadium]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. It is the future home stadium of the [[Charlotte 49ers football|Charlotte 49ers football team]] representing the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]] (UNC Charlotte), and it is due to open for the [[2013 Charlotte 49ers football team|49ers' first football season]] as members of the [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Championship Subdivision|Football Championship Subdivision]].

Proposed by the university's chancellor in 2008, the stadium was approved by the school's [[Higher_education_governing_board#Trustees|Board of Trustees]], the Board of Governors for the [[University of North Carolina]], and North Carolina Governor [[Bev Perdue]] before officially beginning construction in April 2011.<ref name="GB1">{{cite press release |url=http://www.charlotte49ers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=590213&SPID=72735&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=23200&ATCLID=205144342 |title=Football Breaks Ground on Stadium|date=April 28, 2011|publisher=Charlotte Sports Information|accessdate=September 3, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120325125210/http://www.charlotte49ers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=590213&SPID=72735&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=23200&ATCLID=205144342 |archivedate=March 25, 2012 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Businessmen [[Hugh McColl]] and [[Jerry Richardson]] purchased the naming rights to the stadium's playing field in 2011, and the stadium was named for Richardson in 2013 after an additional $10 million donation. Construction finished in October 2012, and the football team began hosting informal scrimmages in November.

The horseshoe-shaped stadium has a capacity of 15,300 people, but since Charlotte will rejoin [[Conference USA]] in 2013, it is now almost certain that the stadium will be expanded well beyond the originally planned capacity.<ref name="observer">{{cite news |url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/06/24/3339614/charlotte-49ers-football-in-a.html |accessdate=July 9, 2012 |last=Scott |first=David |title=Charlotte 49ers Football in a Hurry-up Before Games Even Start |newspaper=[[The Charlotte Observer]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120704002002/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/06/24/3339614/charlotte-49ers-football-in-a.html |archivedate=July 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes}}</ref> Much of the current home side seating area is available with the purchase of a [[personal seat license]]. The venue includes various amenities, such as the Judy W. Rose football center, which includes athletic and academic facilities.

==History==
===Funding===
In February 2008, a university-appointed committee presented a report to UNC Charlotte [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] Phil Dubois recommending the addition of a football program at the school, which would cost approximately $11.5 million per year and would be funded primarily through an annually increasing student athletic fee.<ref>{{cite report |last1=Everett |first1=Mac |last2=Atkinson |first2=Johnson |last3=Beaver |first3=Jeff |last4=Grainger |first4=Ike |last5=Hensley |first5=Bill |last6=Leak |first6=Jeff |last7=Morgan |first7=Bob |last8=Price |first8=Joe |last9=Rouse |first9=Mary Ann |last10=Scheer |first10=Carl |last11=Tillman |first11=Krista |others=David Broome&ndash;legal counsel, Judy Rose&ndash;athletic director, Darin Spaese&ndash;senior associate athletic director |date=February 15, 2008 |title=UNC &ndash; Charlotte Football Study |url=http://explorefootball.kennesaw.edu/docs/unc_charlotte_football_study.pdf |publisher=The Lee Institute |pages=6&ndash;8 |accessdate=July 9, 2012 |format=PDF |laysummary=http://nineronline.com/2012/unc-charlotte-will-not-see-marching-band-with-addition-of-football/ |laydate=February 5, 2012 |laysource=Elizabeth Bartholf }}</ref> In June 2008, Dubois presented a report to the school's [[Higher_education_governing_board#Trustees|Board of Trustees]] addressing the potential impact of the addition of a football stadium on the university. In the report, Dubois suggested two possible locations for a new stadium: a renovated [[Irwin Belk Track and Field Center/Transamerica Field]] or a new facility at the site of recreational fields on the northwestern part of the campus. Dubois preferred the latter for cost reasons.<ref name="Report">{{cite news |title=UNCC Chancellor's Football Report Sobering|first=Peter|last=St. Onge|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2008/06/03/34188/uncc-chancellors-football-report.html|newspaper=[[The Charlotte Observer]]|date=June 3, 2008|accessdate=September 3, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120919211151/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2008/06/03/34188/uncc-chancellors-football-report.html |archivedate=September 19, 2012 |deadurl=no}}</ref> In November 2008, the board unanimously approved Dubois' proposal to add a football program.<ref>{{cite news |title=UNCC Kicks Off Move to Launch Football|first=Erik|last=Spanberg|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/stories/2008/11/10/daily41.html|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|newspaper=[[American City Business Journals|Charlotte Business Journal]]|date=November 8, 2008|accessdate=September 3, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121103042831/http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/stories/2008/11/10/daily41.html |archivedate=November 3, 2012 |deadurl=no }}</ref>

On December 11, 2009, the Board of Trustees approved a financing plan for football, which called for the university to borrow $40.5 million in state-issued bonds to construct a permanent football stadium and [[field house]], citing a favorable bidding environment and greater interest in ticket sales as their reasons for building a new facility rather than expanding [[American Legion Memorial Stadium]].<ref name="approve">{{cite press release |url=http://publicrelations.uncc.edu/news-events/news-releases/unc-charlotte-trustees-approve-financing-plan-football|title=UNC Charlotte Trustees Approve Financing Plan for Football|publisher=UNC Charlotte Office of Public Relations|date=December 11, 2009|accessdate=September 3, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120321202932/http://publicrelations.uncc.edu/news-events/news-releases/unc-charlotte-trustees-approve-financing-plan-football |archivedate=March 21, 2012 |deadurl=no}}</ref> On February 12, 2010, the [[University of North Carolina]] [[Higher_education_governing_board#Governors|Board of Governors]] approved a student fee increase to fund the construction of the facility.<ref name="UNCapprove">{{cite press release |url=http://publicrelations.uncc.edu/news-events/news-releases/unc-board-governors-approve-football-funding|title=UNC Board of Governors Approve Football Funding|publisher=UNC Charlotte Office of Public Relations|date=February 12, 2010|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}</ref> Students pay an annual fee of $120 to fund the stadium's construction debt.
