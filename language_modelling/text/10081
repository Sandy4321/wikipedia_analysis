The '''Rhine''' ({{lang-de|Rhein}}; {{lang-nl|Rijn}}; {{lang-fr|Rhin}}; {{lang-rm|Rain}}; {{lang-it|Reno}}; {{lang-la|Rhenus}}) is one of the longest and most important [[river]]s in [[Europe]], at {{convert|1320|km|abbr=on}}, with an average discharge of more than {{convert|2000|m3/s|abbr=on}}.

The name of the Rhine comes from [[Old High German]]: ''Rhine'', which in turn comes from [[Middle High German]]: ''Rin'', from the [[Proto-Indo-European root]] *''reie-'' ("to move, flow, run").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Rhine|title=Rhine|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2009-02-10|publisher=Douglas Harper|year=2001|month=November}}</ref> The [[Reno River]] in Italy shares the same etymology.

The Rhine and the [[Danube]] formed most of the northern inland frontier of the [[Roman Empire]] and since those days, the Rhine has been a vital, navigable waterway, carrying trade and goods deep inland. It has also served as a defensive feature and has been the basis for regional and international borders. The many [[castle]]s and prehistoric [[fortification]]s along the Rhine testify to its importance as a waterway. River traffic could be stopped at these locations, usually for the purpose of collecting tolls, by the state controlling that portion of the river.

==Geography==
===Switzerland===
The Rhine's origin is in the [[Swiss Alps]], in the canton of [[Graub<U+00FC>nden]], where its two main [[tributary|tributaries]] are called the ''Vorderrhein'' and ''Hinterrhein''. The ''Vorderrhein'' or Anterior Rhine, springs from ''Lai da Tuma'' ([[Tomasee]]), near the [[Oberalp Pass]] and passes the impressive ''[[Ruinaulta]]'' or Swiss Grand Canyon. The ''Hinterrhein'' or Posterior Rhine, starts from the [[Paradies Glacier]], near the Rheinquellhorn at the southern border of Switzerland. One of the latter tributaries originates in ''Val di Lei'' in Italy. Both tributaries meet near [[Reichenau, Switzerland]], a village in the municipality of [[Tamins]]. From Reichenau, the Rhine flows north as the ''Alpenrhein'', passing [[Chur]], forming the border between [[Liechtenstein]] and then [[Austria]], on the east side and [[Canton of St. Gallen]] of Switzerland, on the west side, then emptying into [[Lake Constance]]. Emerging from Lake Constance, flowing generally westward, as the ''Hochrhein'', it passes the [[Rhine Falls]] and is joined by the river [[Aar]]. The Aar more than doubles the Rhine's water discharge, to an average of nearly {{convert|1000|m3/s|abbr=on}}. The Aar also contains the waters from the {{convert|4274|m|abbr=on}} summit of [[Finsteraarhorn]], the highest point of the Rhine [[drainage basin|basin]]. The Rhine roughly forms the boundary with Germany from Lake Constance, until it turns north at the so-called [[Rhine knee]] at [[Basel]].

===Germany, France, Luxembourg=== 
The Rhine is the longest river in [[Germany]]. It is here that the Rhine encounters some of its main tributaries, such as the [[Neckar]], the [[Main]] and later, the [[Moselle River|Moselle]], which contributes an average discharge of over {{convert|300|m3/s|abbr=on}}. Northeastern [[France]] drains to the Rhine via the [[Moselle River|Moselle]]; smaller rivers drain the [[Vosges]] and [[Jura Mountains]], uplands. Most of [[Luxembourg]] and a very small part of [[Belgium]], also drain to the Rhine via the [[Moselle River|Moselle]]. Approaching the Dutch border, the Rhine has an annual mean discharge of {{convert|2290|m3/s|abbr=on}} and an average width of {{convert|400|m|abbr=on}}. 

Between [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]] and [[Bonn]], the [[Middle Rhine]] flows through the [[Rhine Gorge]], a formation created by erosion, which happened at about the same rate as an [[tectonic uplift|uplift]] in the region, leaving the river at about its original level and the surrounding lands raised. This gorge is quite deep and is the stretch of the river known for its many [[castle]]s and [[vineyard]]s. It is a [[List of World Heritage Sites in Europe|UNESCO World Heritage Site (2002)]] and known as "the Romantic Rhine", with more than 40 castles and fortresses from the [[Middle Ages]] and many quaint and lovely country villages. 

Until the early 1980s, industry was a major source of water [[pollution]]. Although many plants and factories can be found along the Rhine up into [[Switzerland]], it is along the [[Lower Rhine]] in the [[Ruhr Area]], that the bulk of them are concentrated, as the river passes the major cities of [[Cologne]], [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]] and [[Duisburg]]. Duisburg is the home of Europe's largest inland port, functioning as a hub to the sea ports of [[Rotterdam]], [[Antwerp]] and [[Amsterdam]]. The [[Ruhr]], which joins the Rhine in Duisburg, is nowadays a clean river, thanks to a combination of stricter environmental controls, a transition, from heavy industry to light industry and cleanup measures, such as the [[reforestation]] of slag heaps and brownfields. The Ruhr currently provides the region with drinking water. It contributes {{convert|70|m3/s|abbr=on}} to the Rhine. Other rivers in the [[Ruhr Area]], above all, the [[Emscher]], still carry a considerable degree of [[pollution]].

===Netherlands===
The Rhine then turns west and enters the [[Netherlands]], where together with the rivers [[Meuse River|Meuse]] and [[Scheldt]], it forms the extensive [[Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta]], one of the larger [[river delta]]s in western Europe. Crossing the border into the Netherlands at [[Spijk (Lingewaal)|Spijk]], close to [[Nijmegen]] and [[Arnhem]], the Rhine is at its widest, but the river then splits into three main [[distributary|distributaries]]: the [[Waal River]], [[Nederrijn]] ("Lower Rhine") and [[IJssel]].

From here, the situation becomes more complicated, as the Dutch name ''Rijn'', no longer coincides with the main flow of water. Two-thirds of the Rhine water flows farther west, through the Waal and then, via the [[Merwede]] and [[Nieuwe Merwede]] ([[De Biesbosch]]), merging with the Meuse, through the [[Hollands Diep]] and [[Haringvliet]] [[estuary|estuaries]], into the [[North Sea]]. The [[Beneden Merwede]] branches off, near [[Hardinxveld-Giessendam]] and continues as the [[Noord River|Noord]], to join the [[Lek River|Lek]], near the village of [[Kinderdijk]], to form the [[Nieuwe Maas]], then flows past [[Rotterdam]] and continues via [[Het Scheur]] and the [[Nieuwe Waterweg]], to the North Sea. The [[Oude Maas]] branches off, near [[Dordrecht]], farther down rejoining the [[Nieuwe Maas]] to form [[Het Scheur]].

The other third portion of the water flows through the [[Pannerdens Kanaal]] and redistributes in the IJssel and Nederrijn. The IJssel branch carries one ninth of the water volume north, into the [[IJsselmeer]] (a former bay), while the Nederrijn flows west, parallel to the Waal and carries approximately two ninths of the flow. However, at [[Wijk bij Duurstede]], the Nederrijn changes its name and becomes the [[Lek River|Lek]]. It flows farther west, to rejoin the [[Noord River]] into the [[Nieuwe Maas]] and to the North Sea.

The name ''Rijn'', from here on, is used only for smaller streams farther to the north, which together once formed the main river Rhine in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times. Though they retained the name, these streams do not carry water from the Rhine anymore, but are used for draining the surrounding land and [[polder]]s. From Wijk bij Duurstede, the old north branch of the Rhine is called [[Kromme Rijn]] ("Bent Rhine") past [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], first [[Leidse Rijn]] ("Rhine of [[Leiden]]") and then, [[Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)|Oude Rijn]] ("Old Rhine"). The latter flows west into a [[sluice]] at [[Katwijk]], where its waters can be discharged into the [[North Sea]]. This branch once formed the line along which the [[Limes Germanicus]] were built. During periods of lower sea levels within the various ice ages, the Rhine took a left turn, creating the [[Channel River]], the course of which now lies below the [[English Channel]].

The bridges at Huningue, Rastatt, R<U+00FC>desheim (Hindenburgbr<U+00FC>cke) and Remagen (Ludendorffbr<U+00FC>cke), were built for strategic military reasons only, in order to allow the Imperial German Army and later on, the Wehrmacht, to quickly transport forces by rail to Germany's western border in the event of a war with France. Unlike other bridges built for the same purpose, such as the ones at Koblenz or Cologne, these bridges were of almost no use in peacetime and thus, were never rebuilt, after their destruction during the last months of World War II, except for the one at Rastatt, which was used to supply units of the French Army stationed in the area.

==Geologic history==
===Alpine orogeny===
[[Image:Rhinegrabencross.jpg|thumb|Schematic cross section of the [[Upper Rhine Graben]].]]

The Rhine flows from the [[Alps]] to the [[North Sea#Geological history|North Sea Basin]]; the geography and geology of its present day watershed has been developing, since the [[Alpine orogeny]] began. 

In southern [[Europe]], the stage was set in the [[Triassic]] Period of the [[Mesozoic]] Era, with the opening of the [[Tethys Ocean]], between the Eurasian and African [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]], between about 240 [[Before Present|MBP]] and 220 MBP (million years before present). The present [[Mediterranean Sea]] descends from this somewhat larger Tethys sea. At about 180 MBP, in the [[Jurassic]] Period, the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the Tethys floor, causing it to be subducted under Eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the Alpine Orogeny of the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] Periods. Several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally, generating the individual features of Mediterranean geography: Iberia pushed up the [[Pyrenees]]; [[Italy]], the Alps, and [[Anatolia]], moving west, the mountains of [[Greece]] and the islands. The compression and orogeny continue today, as shown by the ongoing raising of the mountains a small amount each year and the active volcanoes.

In northern [[Europe]], the North Sea Basin had formed during the [[Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]] periods and continued to be a sediment receiving basin since. In between the zone of Alpine orogeny and North Sea Basin subsidence, remained highlands resulting from an earlier orogeny ([[Variscan orogeny|Variscan]]), such as the [[Ardennes]], [[Eifel]] and [[Vosges]].

From the [[Eocene]] onwards, the ongoing [[Alpine orogeny]] caused a N-S rift system to develop in this zone. The main elements of this rift are the [[Upper Rhine Graben]], in southeast [[Germany]] and eastern [[France]] and the [[Lower Rhine Embayment]], in northwest [[Germany]] and the southeastern [[Netherlands]]. By the time of the [[Miocene]], a river system had developed in the [[Upper Rhine Graben]], that continued northward and is considered the first Rhine river. At that time, it did not yet carry discharge from the [[Alps]]; instead, the watersheds of the [[Rhone]] and [[Danube]] drained the northern flanks of the Alps.

===Stream capture===
The watershed of the Rhine reaches into the [[Alps]] today, but it did not start out that way.<ref name="Ber">{{Cite book|last1=Berendsen|first1=Henk J. A.|last2=Stouthamer|first2=Esther|title=Palaeogeographic Development of the Rhine-Meuse Delta, the Netherlands: With Maps|date=2001|publisher=Van Gorcum Ltd|location=Assen|url=http://www.geo.uu.nl/fg/palaeogeography/books/palaeogeographic-development|isbn=90-232-3695-5|oclc=248331033}}</ref> In the [[Miocene]] period, the watershed of the Rhine reached south, only to the [[Eifel]] and [[Westerwald]] hills, about {{convert|450|km|abbr=on}} north of the Alps. The Rhine then had the [[Sieg]] as a tributary, but not yet the [[Moselle River]]. The northern Alps were then drained by the [[Danube]].

Through [[stream capture]], the Rhine extended its watershed southward. By the [[Pliocene]] period, the Rhine had captured streams down to the [[Vosges Mountains]], including the Mosel, the [[Main]] and the [[Neckar]]. The northern Alps were then drained by the [[Rhone]]. By the early [[Pleistocene]] period, the Rhine had captured most of its current Alpine watershed from the Rh<U+00F4>ne, including the [[Aar]]. Since that time, the Rhine has added the watershed above [[Lake Constance]] (Vorderrhein, [[Hinterrhein River]], Alpenrhein; captured from the Rh<U+00F4>ne), the upper reaches of the Main, beyond [[Schweinfurt]] and the Vosges Mountains, captured from the [[Meuse River]], to its watershed.

===Ice Ages===
The [[Pleistocene]] (~2.5 million years ago - 11,600 years ago) was the geological period of the Ice Ages. Since approximately 600,000 years ago, six major Ice Ages have occurred, in which sea level dropped {{convert|120|m|abbr=on}} and much of the continental margins became exposed. In the Early Pleistocene, the Rhine followed a course to the northwest, through the present North Sea. During the so-called Anglian glaciation (~450,000 yr BP, marine oxygen isotope stage 12), the northern part of the present North Sea was blocked by the ice and a large lake developed, that overflowed through the English Channel. This caused the Rhine's course to be diverted through the English Channel. Since then, during glacial times, the river mouth was located offshore of [[Brest, France]] and rivers, like the [[River Thames|Thames]] and the [[Seine]], became tributaries to the Rhine. During interglacials, when sea level rose to approximately the present level, the Rhine built deltas, in what is now the Netherlands.

The last [[glacier|glacial]] ran from (~74,000 BP = Before Present), until the end of the [[Pleistocene]] (~11,600 BP). In northwest [[Europe]], it saw two very cold phases, peaking around 70,000 BP and around 29,000-24,000 BP. The last phase slightly predates the global last ice age maximum ([[Last Glacial Maximum]]). During this time, the lower Rhine flowed roughly west through the Netherlands and extended to the southwest, through the English Channel and finally, to the Atlantic Ocean. The English Channel, the Irish Channel and most of the [[North Sea]] were dry land, mainly because sea level was approximately {{convert|120|m|abbr=on}} lower than today. 

Most of the Rhine's current course was not under the ice during the last Ice Age; although, its source must still have been a glacier. A [[tundra]], with Ice Age flora and fauna, stretched across middle Europe, from Asia to the Atlantic Ocean. Such was the case during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], ca. 22,000-14,000 yr BP, when ice-sheets covered Scandinavia, the Baltics, Scotland and the Alps, but left the space between as open tundra. The [[loess]] or wind-blown dust over that tundra, settled in and around the Rhine Valley, contributing to its current agricultural usefulness.

===End of the Last Ice Age===
As northwest Europe slowly began to warm up from 22,000 years ago onward, frozen subsoil and expanded alpine glaciers began to thaw and fall-winter snow covers melted in spring. Much of the discharge was routed to the Rhine and its downstream extension. <ref>Menot et al. 2006, Science</ref> Rapid warming and changes of vegetation, to open forest, began about 13,000 BP. By 9000 BP, Europe was fully forested. With globally shrinking ice-cover, ocean water levels rose and the English Channel and North Sea re-inundated. Meltwater, adding to the ocean and land [[subsidence]], drowned the former coasts of Europe [[transgression (geology)|transgressionally]].

About 11000 yr ago, the Rhine estuary was in the Dover Strait. There remained some dry land in the southern [[North Sea]], connecting mainland [[Europe]] to Britain. About 9000 yr ago, that last divide was overtopped / dissected. These events were well within the residence of man. 

Since 7500 yr ago, a situation with tides and currents, very similar to present has existed. Rates of sea-level rise had dropped so far, that natural sedimentation by the Rhine and coastal processes together, could compensate the transgression by the sea; in the last 7000 years, the coast line was roughly at the same location. In the southern [[North Sea]], due to ongoing tectonic subsidence, the sea-level is still rising, at the rate of about {{convert|1|-|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} per century (1 metre or 39 inches in last 3000 years).

About 7000-5000 BP, a general warming encouraged migration up the [[Danube]] and down the Rhine, by peoples to the east, perhaps encouraged by the sudden massive expansion of the [[Black Sea]], as the [[Mediterranean Sea]] burst into it through the [[Bosporus]], about 7500 BP.

===Holocene delta===
At the begin of the Holocene (~11,700 years ago), the Rhine occupied its Late-Glacial valley. As a [[meander]]ing river, it reworked its ice-age braidplain. As sea-level continued to rise in the Netherlands, the formation of the Holocene Rhine-Meuse delta began (~8,000 years ago). Coeval absolute sea-level rise and tectonic subsidence have strongly influenced delta evolution. Other factors of importance to the shape of the delta are the local tectonic activities of the Peel Boundary Fault, the substrate and geomorphology, as inherited from the Last Glacial and the coastal-marine dynamics, such as barrier and tidal inlet formations.<ref>Cohen, et al., 2002)</ref>

Since ~3000 yr BP (= years Before Present), human impact is seen in the delta. As a result of increasing land clearance ([[Bronze Age]] agriculture), in the upland areas (central [[Germany]]), the sediment load of the Rhine River has strongly increased<ref>Hoffmann et al. 2007</ref> and delta growth has sped up.<ref>Gouw & Erkens, 2007</ref> This caused increased flooding and sedimentation, ending peat formation in the delta. The shifting of river channels to new locations, on the floodplain (termed avulsion), was the main process distributing sediment across the subrecent delta. Over the past 6000 years, approximately 80 avulsions have occurred.<ref name="Ber" /> Direct human impact in the delta started with peat mining, for salt and fuel, from [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times onward. This was followed by embankment, of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries, which took place in the 11-13th century AD. Thereafter, canals were dug, bends were short cut and groynes were built, to prevent the river's channels from migrating or silting up. 

At present, the branches Waal and Nederrijn-Lek discharge to the North Sea, through the former Meuse [[estuary]], near Rotterdam. The river IJssel branch flows to the north and enters the [[IJsselmeer]], formerly the [[Zuider Zee]] brackish lagoon; however, since 1932, a freshwater lake. The discharge of the Rhine is divided among three branches: the River Waal (6/9 of total discharge), the River Nederrijn - Lek (2/9 of total discharge) and the River IJssel (1/9 of total discharge). This discharge distribution has been maintained since 1709, by river engineering works, including the digging of the Pannerdens canal and since the 20th century, with the help of weirs in the Nederrijn river.

==Prehistory==
===Paleolithic===
During the [[Middle Paleolithic]] (ca 100,000-30,000 BP), Western Europe, including the Rhine and Danube Valleys, was occupied by the [[Neanderthal]], to which belonged the [[Mousterian]] culture of stone tools. Mousterian sites are not considered intrusive. It is believed that the Neanderthals may have evolved from the preceding [[Homo erectus]] in the vicinity of the glaciers, but the question has by no means been settled definitively.

Neanderthal sites are denser to the south, where open forest prevailed and the limestone terrain offered more caves as dwellings. The Rhine ran through an open tundra, where Neanderthals hunted big game, such as the [[rhinoceros]] and the [[woolly mammoth]]. Accordingly, open air Mousterian sites have been discovered in and around the Rhine valley.

===Mesolithic===
Before approximately 5600 BC, the Rhine Valley, along with most of Europe, was occupied by [[Cro-Magnon]] man, in the [[Mesolithic]] stage of cultural development; that is, they hunted and gathered, but owned a larger and more specialized tool kit than the [[Paleolithic]] people, knew more about the plants and animals, and even may have kept a few animals.

===Iron Age===
During the early [[Iron Age]], both banks of the Rhine were inhabited by [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribes]]. However, in the beginning of the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] (ca 600 BC), the [[Proto-Germanic]] tribes crossed the [[Weser River]] and the [[Aller]], expanding the whole distance to the banks of the Rhine. This expansion is shown archaeologically in the form of the [[Jastorf culture]]. From ca 500 BC onwards, the lower Rhine, not the Weser or the Aller, would increasingly mark the border between the Celtic and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]].

==Historic and military relevance==
[[Image:Loreley von Spitznack.jpg|thumb|[[Loreley]]]]

The human history of the Rhine begins with the writers of the late [[Roman Republic]] and early [[Roman Empire]]. Nearly all the classical sources mention the Rhine and the name is always the same: Rhenus in Latin or Rheonis in Greek. The Romans viewed the Rhine as the outermost border of civilization and reason, beyond which were mythical creatures and wild Germanic tribesmen, not far themselves from being beasts of the wilderness, they inhabited. As it was a wilderness, the Romans were eager to explore it. This view is typified by ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', a long public inscription of [[Augustus]], in which he boasts of his exploits; including, sending an expeditionary fleet north of the Rheinmouth, to [[Old Saxony]] and [[Jutland]], which he claims no Roman had ever done.

Throughout the long history of Rome, the Rhine was considered the border between [[Gaul]] or the [[Celts]] and the Germanic peoples; although, it should be noted that the historical ethnonyms do not carry their modern ethno-linguistic definitions. Typical of this point of view is a quote from [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]], ''Commentary on the Aeneid of Vergil'' (On Book 8 Line 727): 
:"''(Rhenus) fluvius Galliae, qui Germanos a Gallia dividit''"
:"''(The Rhein is a) river of Gaul, which divides the Germanic people from Gaul.''"

The Rhine, in the earlier sources, was always a Gallic river.

As the [[Roman Empire]] grew, the Romans found it necessary to station troops along the Rhine. They kept two army groups there (exercitus), the inferior or "lower", and the superior or "upper", which is the first distinction between upper Germania and lower Germania. It originally probably only meant upstream and downstream, the Niederrhein and Oberrhein regions of the map, included with this article.

The Romans kept eight legions in five bases along the Rhine. The actual number of legions present at any base or in all, depended on whether a state or threat of war existed. Between about 14 AD and 180 AD, the assignment of legions was as follows: for the army of [[Germania Inferior]], two legions at Vetera ([[Xanten]]), [[Legio I Germanica|I Germanica]] and [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|XX Valeria]] ([[Pannonia]]n troops); two legions at oppidum Ubiorum ("town of the [[Ubii]]"), which was renamed to Colonia Agrippina, descending to [[Cologne]], [[Legio V Alaudae|V Alaudae]], a Celtic legion recruited from [[Gallia Narbonensis]] and [[Legio XXI Rapax|XXI]], possibly a [[Galatia]]n legion from the other side of the empire.

For the army of [[Germania Superior]]: one legion, [[Legio II Augusta|II Augusta]], at Argentoratum ([[Strasbourg]]); and one, [[Legio XIII Gemina|XIII Gemina]], at Vindonissa ([[Windisch]]). Vespasian had commanded II Augusta, before his promotion to imperator. In addition, were a double legion, XIV and XVI, at Moguntiacum ([[Mainz]]).

The two originally military districts, of [[Germania Inferior]] and [[Germania Superior]], came to influence the surrounding tribes, who later respected the distinction in their alliances and confederations. For example, the upper Germanic peoples combined into the [[Alamanni|Alemanni]]. For a time, the Rhine ceased to be a border, when the [[Franks]] crossed the river and occupied Roman-dominated Celtic [[Gaul]], as far as [[Paris]].

The first urban settlement, on the grounds of what is today the centre of Cologne, along the Rhine, was ''Oppidum Ubiorum'', which was founded in 38 BC, by the [[Ubii]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]]. Cologne became acknowledged, as a city by the Romans in 50 AD, by the name of ''Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium''. Considerable Roman remains can be found in contemporary Cologne, especially near the wharf area, along the Rhine, where a notable discovery, of a 1900 year old Roman boat, was made on the Rhine banks, in late 2007.<ref>[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18208 C. Michael Hogan, ''Cologne Wharf'', the Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham, 2007]</ref>

Subsequently, language changes began to play a major political role. [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] dissimilated into [[West Low German|Low Saxon]]; [[Low Franconian languages]] and [[High German languages]], roughly along the old lines. Perhaps, it had been doing so all along. [[Charlemagne]] united all the Franks in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], but he did not rule over a people of uniform language. After his death, the empire split, more or less along language lines, with the Low Franconian being spoken in the Netherlands and the Low Saxon and High German, in what became Germany. The Romanized Franks became the French. The Rhine once again became a political border.

The Rhine as a border has been and still is a mystical and political symbol. German authors and composers have written reams about it. During World War II, it was still considered the sacred border, of Germany and still was a defensive barrier. The Germans fought especially hard to defend it. 

The Rhine is closely linked to many important historical events <U+2014> particularly military ones <U+2014> as well as myths. For example:
* The [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]], which finally established the Rhine as the northern frontier of the [[Roman Empire]].
* It was a historic object of frontier trouble, between [[France]] and [[Germany]]. Establishing "[[natural border]]s" on the Rhine was a long term goal of French foreign policy, since the [[Middle Ages]]; though, the [[language border]] was - and is - far more to the west. French leaders, such as [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], tried with varying degrees of success to annex lands west of the Rhine. The [[Confederation of the Rhine]] was established by Napoleon, as a [[French client republic]], in 1806 and lasted until 1814, during which time it served as a significant source of resources and military manpower for the [[First French Empire]]. In 1840, the ''Rhine crisis'' evolved, because the French prime minister, [[Adolphe Thiers]], started to talk about the Rhine border. In response, the poem and song, ''[[Die Wacht am Rhein]]'' (''The Watch on the Rhine''), was composed at that time, calling for the defense of the western bank of the Rhine against France. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]], it rose to the de-facto status of a national anthem in Germany. The song remained popular in [[World War I]] and was used in the movie ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''.
* At the end of [[World War I]], the [[Rhineland]] was subject to the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. This decreed that it would be occupied by the allies, until 1935 and after that, it would be a demilitarised zone, with the German army forbidden to enter. The Treaty of Versailles and this particular provision, in general, caused much resentment in Germany and is often cited as helping [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power. The allies left the Rheinland, in 1930 and the German army re-occupied it in 1936, which was enormously popular in Germany. Although the allies could probably have prevented the re-occupation, Britain and France were not inclined to do so, a feature of their policy of [[appeasement]] to Hitler. 
* In [[World War II]], it was recognised that the Rhine would present a formidable natural obstacle to the invasion of Germany, by the western allies. The Rhine bridge at [[Arnhem]], immortalized in the book, [[A Bridge Too Far (book)|''A Bridge Too Far'']] and the [[A Bridge Too Far (film)|film]], was a central focus of the battle for Arnhem, during the failed [[Operation Market Garden]] of September 1944. The bridges at [[Nijmegen]], over the Waal distributary of the Rhine, were also an objective of Operation Market Garden. In a separate operation, the [[Ludendorff Bridge]], crossing the Rhine at [[Remagen]], became famous, when U.S. forces were able to capture it intact <U+2014> much to their own surprise <U+2014> after the Germans failed to demolish it. This also became the subject of a film, ''[[The Bridge at Remagen]]''.
* In November 1986, a terrible disaster happened, as fire broke out in a chemical factory near [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]].  Chemicals soon made their way into the river and caused pollution problems. About 30 tons<!--metric, short, or long--> of chemicals were discharged into the river. Locals were told to stay indoors, as foul smells were present in the area. The pollutants included chemicals, such as: pesticides, mercury and other highly poisonous agricultural chemicals.
* [[Mainz Cathedral]] <U+2014> this more than 1,000-year-old cathedral is seat to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz|Bishop of Mainz]]. It holds significant historic value, as the seat of the once politically powerful secular prince-archbishop within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It houses historical funerary monuments and religious artifacts.
* The ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', an epic poem in Middle High German, tells the saga of Siegfried/[[Sigurd]], who killed a dragon on the [[Drachenfels (Siebengebirge)]] ("dragons rock"), near [[Bonn]] at the Rhine and of the Burgundians and their court at Worms, at the Rhine and Kriemhild's golden treasure, which was thrown into the Rhine by Hagen.
* ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' <U+2014> inspired by the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', the Rhine is one of the settings for the first opera of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]''. The action of the epic opens and ends underneath the Rhine, where three Rheinmaidens swim and protect a hoard of [[gold]].
* The [[Loreley]]/Lorelei is a rock on the eastern bank of the Rhine, that is associated with several legendary tales, poems and songs. The river spot has a reputation for being a challenge for inexperienced navigators.
* Many historic [[List of castles in Rhineland-Palatinate|castles]] are located along the Rhine.
