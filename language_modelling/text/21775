''Viggo Stoltenberg-Hansen'', professor at [[Uppsala University]], Department of Mathematics, is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] mathematician/logician and expert on [[domain theory]] and [[recursion theory]] (also known as [[computability theory]]). Viggo received his PhD in Mathematics (titled "On Priority Arguments In Friedberg Theories") from [[University of Toronto]] in 1973, supervised by [[Douglas Clarke]]. 

One of his PhD students is [[Erik Palmgren]], now himself also a professor in mathematical logic at [[Uppsala University]], with a wide range of contributions in mathematical logic, domain theory, type theory, and topos theory. Another is Jens Blanck, known for his thesis which developed a theory for domain representations of metric spaces, an area to which Viggo himself has contributed.

==Work on domain theory==

Research contributions not listed here yet.

Viggo Stoltenberg-Hansen and [[John V. Tucker|John Tucker]] developed in the early 1980s a general method of domain representations of topological algebras.

Viggo is the main author of the textbook "Mathematical Theory of Domains", Cambridge University Press, 1994 (coauthored by I. Lindstr<U+00F6>m and E. Griffor), and also of a set of [[Marktoberdorf]] summer school lecture notes on domain theory.

==Work on effective domains==

Viggo Stoltenberg-Hansen and John Tucker made a thorough analysis of the computability associated to ''effective algebras''  and continuity of homomorphisms between such.
