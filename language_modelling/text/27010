The '''1959 Mexico Hurricane''' was a devastating [[tropical cyclone]] that was one of the worst [[Pacific hurricane]]s ever. It impacted the Pacific coast of [[Mexico]] in October 1959. It killed at least 1,000 people, and perhaps double that, a record that still stands, and caused at least 280&nbsp;million dollars in damage. The system's worst impact was in the [[States of Mexico|Mexican States]] of [[Colima]] and [[Jalisco]] due to high winds, and flooding. This hurricane was also a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] and set several records, related to both impact and meteorological statistics.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|1959 Mexico hurricane track.png}}
The fifteenth known tropical cyclone of the [[1950-1969 Pacific hurricane seasons#1959 season|1959 season]] was first noticed on [[October 23]], south of Mexico. As it was already a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1 hurricane]], it had probably formed a little bit earlier than this date. It took the usual northwesterly track for hurricanes in the eastern Pacific. It steadily intensified, becoming a major hurricane on [[October 25]] and reaching Category 4 on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir-Simpson Scale]] the next day. This was followed by a turn to the northeast. It continued to intensify, and became a Category 5 on [[October 27]]. It smashed ashore close to [[Manzanillo, Colima]]. Weakened quickly by landfall, it dissipated over central Mexico on [[October 29]].<ref name="best track">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1949to2007_epa.txt|title=Eastern North Pacific Tracks File 1949-2007|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|date=2008-03-04|accessdate=2008-03-11}}</ref>

This hurricane's lowest [[atmospheric pressure|central pressure]] is 958&nbsp;millibars. Its highest windspeed is 140&nbsp;knots(160&nbsp;mph, 260&nbsp;km/h). The official "best track" data set indicates that this velocity was attained after landfall.<ref name="best track"/> However, a minor revision corrects this error, making it clear that the hurricane strengthened over water and confirming that the hurricane made landfall with strong winds due to a reading above 135&nbsp;knots (155&nbsp;mph, 250&nbsp;km/h) in Manzanillo. The revision also indicates that the hurricane may have had higher winds than officially recorded.<ref name="revised best track">{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/metadataEPAC.html|title=EPAC HURDAT Metadata|accessdate=2008-03-11}}</ref>

==Impact==
{{Category 5 Pacific hurricanes|align=right}}
Thousands of people were unprepared for the storm. Thus, the system was dubbed "a sneak hurricane". After passing well offshore from [[Acapulco]], it was forecast to head out to sea. Instead, it recurved east and made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]].<ref name="San Mateo Times 1959-10-30"/>

The hurricane had devastating effects on the places it hit.
