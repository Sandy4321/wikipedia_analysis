The '''[[PlayStation 3]]'s [[Computer hardware|hardware]]''' consists of both the internal systems and a number of peripherals such as the SIXAXIS controller.

Unless otherwise noted, the following specifications are based on a press release by Sony at the [[E3]] 2005 conference,<ref name="pr_specs">{{cite press release|publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.|date=[[2005-05-16]]|title=SONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT INC. TO LAUNCH ITS NEXT GENERATION COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM, PLAYSTATION3 IN SPRING 2006|url=http://www.scei.co.jp/corporate/release/pdf/050517e.pdf|accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref> and slides from a Sony presentation at the 2006 [[Game Developers Conference|Game Developer's Conference]].<ref name=gdcslides>{{cite web | url=http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/game/docs/20060329/3dps3.htm | title=Slides from Sony's 2006 GDC Presentation | publisher=Game Watch | accessdate=2006-05-25}}</ref>

===Central processing unit===
{{main|Cell (microprocessor)}}

The PS3 uses the [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell microprocessor]], which is made up of one 3.2 GHz [[PowerPC]]-based "[[Cell (microprocessor)#Power Processor Element|Power Processing Element]]" (PPE) and six accessible [[Cell (microprocessor)#Synergistic Processing Elements (SPE)|Synergistic Processing Elements (SPEs)]]. A seventh runs in a special mode and is dedicated to aspects of the OS and security, and an eighth is disabled to improve production yields. The floating point performance of the whole system (CPU + GPU) is reported to be 2 [[FLOPS|TFLOPS]].<ref name="pr_specs"/> PlayStation 3's Cell CPU achieves 204 GFLOPS [[single precision]] [[floating point|float]] and 15 GFLOPS [[double precision]]. The PS3 has 256 MB of [[Rambus]] [[XDR DRAM]], clocked at CPU die speed. As of firmware update 2.0101478, 32 MB of the XDR memory is reserved by the PS3's XrossMediaBar user interface.

===Graphics processing unit===
{{main|RSX 'Reality Synthesizer'}}

The [[PS3 GPU|Graphics Processing Unit]] according to Nvidia is based on the [[NVIDIA]] [[GeForce 7 Series|G70]] (previously known as NV47) architecture. The GPU makes use of 256 MB [[GDDR3]] [[Dynamic random access memory|RAM]] clocked at 650 MHz with an [[Double data rate|effective transmission rate]] of 1.3 GHz and up to 224 MB of the 3.2 GHz XDR main memory via the CPU (480 MB max).

===Connectivity===
{{see|PlayStation_3_accessories#AV_Cables{{!}}PlayStation 3 AV Cables}}
The PS3 supports numerous SDTV and HDTV resolutions (from [[480i]] / [[576i]] up to [[1080p]]) and connectivity options (such as [[HDMI]] 1.3a and [[component video]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/pr/pr_20060622.asp|title=Press Releases|publisher=hdmi.org|accessdate=2006-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/videooutput.html|title=Video Output Settings|publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment|accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref> In terms of audio, the PS3 supports a number of formats, including 7.1 digital audio, [[Dolby TrueHD]], and others; audio output is possible over stereo RCA cables (analog), [[TOSLINK|optical digital]] cables, or [[HDMI]]. For the optical disc drive, a wide variety of DVD and CD formats are supported, as well as [[Blu-ray Disc]]s. A 20, 40, 60, or 80GB 2.5" [[Serial ATA|SATA 150]] [[hard disk]] is pre-installed. In the 60&nbsp;GB and 80&nbsp;GB configurations, flash memory can also be used &mdash; either [[Memory Stick]]s, [[CompactFlash]] cards, or [[Secure Digital card|SD]]/[[Multimedia Card|MMC]] cards. All models support USB memory devices; flash drives and external hard drives are both automatically recognized. However, they must be formatted with the [[File Allocation Table#FAT32|FAT32]] file system <U+2014> the PS3 does not support the Microsoft-developed [[NTFS]] file system that is the standard in the [[Windows NT family]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomkiss.net/games/usb-hdd-not-working-with-playstation-3-format-as-fat32/ |title=USB HDD not working with PlayStation 3? Format as FAT32... |accessdate=2007-06-19 |last=Kiss |first=Tom |date=[[2007-03-25]] |publisher=TomKiss.net}}</ref> For communication, the PS3 has one [[Gigabit Ethernet]] port, depending on the version two or four [[Universal Serial Bus|USB 2.0]] ports at the front, Bluetooth 2.0 support, and built-in Wi-Fi on the 40, 60 and 80&nbsp;GB versions.

===Form and power consumption===
The PlayStation 3 console is approximately 5&nbsp;kg, 325&nbsp;mm (W) <U+00D7> 98&nbsp;mm (H) <U+00D7> 274&nbsp;mm (D).<ref>[http://www.scei.co.jp/corporate/release/071009ae.html NEW PLAYSTATION3 (CECHH00 SERIES) COMES IN TWO COLOR VARIATIONS AT A NEW PRICE | PRESS RELEASES <U+FF5C> Sony Computer Entertainment Inc<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The power consumption of the initial PlayStation 3 units based on 90nm [[Cell (microprocessor)]] CPU ranges from 170<U+2013>200 watts during normal use, despite having a 380 watt power supply.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/av/docs/20061111/ps3.htm |title=Blu-ray<U+306E><U+8D77><U+7206><U+5264><U+300C>PLAYSTATION 3<U+300D><U+306E>AV<U+6A5F><U+80FD><U+3092><U+8A66><U+3059><U+3002>|accessdate=2007-02-19 |date=[[2006-11-11]] |publisher=AV Watch |language=Japanese}}</ref>  The power consumption of newer PlayStation 3(65nm process)units ranges from 120-140 watts during normal use.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/03/sony-says-the-40gb-ps3-is-still-using-90nm-chips/ |title=Sony says the 40GB PS3 is still using 90nm chips |accessdate=2008-01-08 |date=[[2007-11-03]] |publisher=Engadget |language=English}}</ref>

===Universal power supply===

The console has a universal power unit built in which makes a 120 V PlayStation 3 suitable in a 240 V region. The power supply can operate on both 60&nbsp;Hz and 50&nbsp;Hz power grids. 
It uses a standard C14 [[IEC connector]] and a C13 power cord appropriate for the region being used in. Some consoles, however, read 220v~240v 1.8a which are not universal. The power supply is capable of delivering approximately 380W, although the PS3 has never been measured using this much power.

==Official accessories==
{{main|PlayStation 3 accessories}}
The PlayStation 3 [[PlayStation 3 accessories#SIXAXIS|Sixaxis]]<ref name="pr accessories">{{cite press release |title=ACCESSORIES FOR PLAYSTATION3 BECOME AVAILABLE |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment |date=2006-10-03 |url=http://www.scei.co.jp/corporate/release/pdf/061003e.pdf |accessdate=2006-10-03 }}</ref> is a controller that is very similar in appearance to that of its predecessors, the [[DualShock]] and [[DualShock#DualShock 2|DualShock 2]]. The SIXAXIS features finer analog sensitivity;<ref name="pr_control">{{cite press release|publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.|date=[[2006-05-09]]|title=SCE ANNOUNCES NEW CONTROLLER FOR PLAYSTATION3|url=http://www.scei.co.jp/corporate/release/pdf/060509be.pdf|accessdate=2006-05-24}}</ref> more trigger-like R2 and L2 buttons; a PS (<U+201C>home<U+201D>) button; and a [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] [[Universal Serial Bus#Types of USB connectors|mini-B]] port for charging the internal battery and for wired play. The PlayStation 3 supports up to 7  simultaneous controllers over Bluetooth.<ref name="pr_specs" /> The Sixaxis is named for its ability to detect motion in the [[Degrees of freedom (engineering)|full six degrees]]; however, unlike the PlayStation 2's DualShock, the Sixaxis controller has no vibration feature.

At its press conference at the 2007 [[Tokyo Game Show]], Sony announced the [[DualShock|DualShock 3]] (trademarked DUALSHOCK 3), a PlayStation 3 controller with the same function and design as the Sixaxis, but with vibration capability.<ref name="DualShock 3 PR">{{cite web |url=http://www.scei.co.jp/corporate/release/070920be.html |title=DUALSHOCK3 Wireless Controller With Rumble Feature To Be Introduced FOR PLAYSTATION3 |accessdate=2007-09-20 |date=2007-09-20 |work= |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment}}</ref> Hands-on accounts describe the controller as being slightly heavier than the standard Sixaxis controller, and capable of vibration forces comparable to the DualShock 2.<ref name="TGS DualShock 3 hands-on">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6179170.html |title=TGS '07: Spot On - The Dual Shock 3 |accessdate=2007-09-20 |author= |date= |work=GameSpot |publisher=CNET }}</ref>

The PlayStation 3 Memory Card Adaptor is a device that allows data to be transferred from PlayStation and PlayStation 2 memory cards to the PlayStation 3's hard disk. The device has a cable that connects to the PS3's USB port on one end, and features a legacy PS2 memory card port on the other end.

Using Bluetooth, the PlayStation 3 BD Remote allows users to control videos and music on Blu-ray Disc and DVD. In Japan, the device was available starting [[December 7]], [[2006]]. The PS3 will accept signals only via its Bluetooth Remote, as the console does not have an [[infrared]] receiver; this prevents the use of [[universal remote]]s with the system. The Blu-ray Disc movie ''[[Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby]]'' was included with the initial 400,000 release copies of the PS3 in North America,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tgdaily.com/2006/10/20/ps3_launch_details/ |title=Sony unveils details of PS3 online services |accessdate=2007-01-24 |last=Raby |first=Mark |date=[[2006-10-20]] |publisher=Tom's Guide Publishing}}</ref> while the first 500,000 European PlayStation Network activations after launch received a free copy of the Blu-ray release of ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://threespeech.com/blog/?p=283 |title=CASINO ROYALE FOR FIRST 500,000 PS3 REGISTRANTS |accessdate=2007-02-22 |date=[[2007-02-12]] |publisher=Three Speech}}</ref>

On [[April 25]], [[2007]], Sony announced the [[PlayStation Eye]]. This is an updated version of the PlayStation&nbsp;2 peripheral, the [[EyeToy]]. The camera is capable of capturing 60&nbsp;[[Frame rate|frames per second]] video at 640<U+00D7>480 resolution and 120&nbsp;fps video at 320<U+00D7>240 resolution. The four-channel microphone on the Eye can block out background noise. The camera will support live video chat and voice chat without a headset, and will be launched in the United States on [[October 23]] for [[United States dollar|US$]]39.99,<ref name="little more">{{cite web |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2007/10/10/playstation-eye-a-little-more-info/ |title=PlayStation Eye, A Little More Info<U+2026> |accessdate=2007-10-11 |last=Stocker |first=Sarah |date=[[October 10]], [[2007]] |format= |work=PlayStation.Blog |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> and in Australia on [[November 8]] for AU$79.95.<ref name="AU page">{{cite web |url=http://au.playstation.com/ps3/hw/playstation3eye.jhtml |title=PLAYSTATION Eye |accessdate=2007-10-12 |work=au.playstation.com |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> It will also be bundled with the card game ''[[The Eye of Judgment]]'' in the United States on the same day as the camera itself for US$69.99,<ref name="5 things">{{cite web |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2007/09/20/5-things-you-dont-know-the-eye-of-judgment/ |title=5 Things You *Don<U+2019>t* Know: THE EYE OF JUDGMENT |accessdate=2007-08-25 |last=Valledor |first=Mark |date=[[September 20]], [[2007]] |format= |work=PlayStation.Blog |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> and in Japan and Australia on [[October 25]], [[2007]] for [[Japanese yen|JP<U+00A5>]]9,980<ref name="JP EOJ site">{{cite web |url=http://www.jp.playstation.com/scej/title/eoj/ |title=The Eye of Judgment<U+FF08><U+30A2><U+30A4><U+30FB><U+30AA><U+30D6><U+30FB><U+30B8><U+30E3><U+30C3><U+30B8><U+30E1><U+30F3><U+30C8><U+FF09> Biolith Rebellion <U+FF5E><U+6A5F><U+795E><U+306E><U+53DB><U+4E71><U+FF5E> |accessdate=2007-08-25 |format=[[Adobe Flash]] |work=jp.playstation.com |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> and [[Australian dollar|AU$]]159.95,<ref name="AU EOJ page">{{cite web |url=http://au.playstation.com/games_media/games/ps3/e/eyejudgment.jhtml |title=Eye of Judgment |accessdate=2007-10-12 |work=au.playstation.com |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> respectively.

Official PlayStation 3 HDMI and Component AV cables are also available for retail.

==Backward compatibility==
The PlayStation 3 does not include interfaces for legacy PlayStation peripherals, though IGN.com tested a legacy controller using a PS2-to-USB adapter, finding that it is compatible, though most other devices (such as the ''[[Guitar Hero (2005 video game)|Guitar Hero]]'' controller) may not be compatible.<ref name="PS2-to-USB">{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/745/745329p1.html|title=Guitar Hero II Compatible with PS3?|publisher=IGN.com|date=[[2006-11-10]]|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref> [[Nyko]] started production on the "Play Adaptor", a PS2-to-USB adapter allowing for guitars and other PlayStation 2 peripherals to be used on the PlayStation 3 and was scheduled for release in Q2/2007, but Nyko stated at the end of March that the production of this device had been postponed due to compatibility problems with the PS3.<ref name="Nyko PS3-to-USB">{{cite web |url=http://www.qj.net/Nyko-Clarifies-Guitar-Hero-Play-Adapter-cancellation/pg/49/aid/87965 |title=Nyko Play Adaptor Cancelled |publisher=qj.net |date=[[2007-03-30]] |accessdate=2006-04-09}}</ref> The PS3 supports both the USB [[EyeToy]] camera/webcam and SOCOM Headset for video and voice chat.
