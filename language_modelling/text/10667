The school emphasizes growth of the students academically, intellectually, spiritually, and ethically by engaging students, their families and the Quaker community in the educational process. Students are given the opportunity to become well-grounded in core Quaker values such as non-violence, integrity, simplicity,  mutual respect and trust.  The school does this by offering activities that promote clear and careful thinking, accountability, the value to one-self to be found in serving others, the value of creativity, and a love for learning. This prepares them to seek and achieve greater success in life. Since there are no class ranks, there is less stress on the kids and little teasing about grades.

The warm atmosphere and small classes provide for a community in which children can grow, learn, and become their own person, with room to make decisions for themselves and find their own individual views. The whole school community participates in weekly meeting for worship, and all are actively engaged in community service.

NGFS welcome families of all races, nationalities, creeds, religions, sexual orientations, and social and economic backgrounds.
