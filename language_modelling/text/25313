'''Canadian Vickers Limited''' was an aircraft and shipbuilding company that operated in [[Canada]] during the early part of the 20th century until 1944.
A subsdiary of [[Vickers Limited|the UK parent]], it built its own aircraft designs as well as others under licence.

==Shipbuilding==
British ship building and weapons manufacturing conglomerate [[Vickers|Vickers Sons & Maxim]] was invited by the Government of Canada in 1911 to establish a Canadian division to manufacture vessels for the nascent [[Royal Canadian Navy]].  Vickers Sons & Maxim established Canadian Vickers Ltd. and constructed a shipyard in the east end of [[Montreal]].

This shipyard would go on to produce many civilian and military ships in Canada, including:

* {{sclass|St. Laurent|destroyer|1}}
** {{HMCS|St. Laurent|DDH 205}}
** {{HMCS|Ottawa|DDH 229}}

* {{sclass|Restigouche|destroyer|1}}
** {{HMCS|Restigouche|DDE 257}}

* {{sclass|Mackenzie|destroyer|1}}
** {{HMCS|Mackenzie|DDE 261}}

In addition, Canadian Vickers has also manufactured a number of luxury yachts

==Aerospace==
Canadian Vickers ventured into aircraft manufacturing in 1923 when it won a contract to supply [[Vickers Viking]] [[flying boat]]s to the recently formed [[Canadian Air Force]]. Between 1923 and 1944, Canadian Vickers produced over 400 aircraft, some of which were original Vickers' designs while the remainder were other manufacturers' designs built under license.

In July 1941, the Canadian government awarded Canadian Vickers a contract to produce PBV-1 "Canso" amphibians (a version of the Consolidated [[PBY Catalina]] flying boat) for the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF). To speed Canso production, the government also authorized construction of a new manufacturing facility at Cartierville Airport in [[Ville Saint Laurent]], on the north-western outskirts of Montreal, and appointed Canadian Vickers to supervise the plant's construction and manage its operation on the government's behalf. Independently Boeing also produced Catalinas in Canada.

In 1944, business pressure compelled Canadian Vickers Ltd. to ask the government to relieve it of its management responsibilities regarding the Cartierville plant. Ottawa agreed and entered into a management contract with [[Canadair]] Limited, a new company founded by a small group of former senior Canadian Vickers personnel headed by Benjamin W. Franklin (no relation to his famous namesake). On [[4 November]] [[1944]], Canadair Limited took over operation of the plant.  In September 1946, Canadair Limited and the plant were acquired by the [[Electric Boat Company]] of Groton, Connecticut.

In 1952, Electric Boat bought [[Consolidated Vultee]] and combined it, Canadair, and several smaller companies to form [[General Dynamics]] Corporation. General Dynamics later became one of the largest U.S. aerospace corporations. Canadair remained a General Dynamics subsidiary until January 1976 when it was re-acquired by the Canadian government.

In December 1986, the government again sold Canadair, this time to [[Bombardier]] Inc., a Quebec-based international conglomerate. Today, Canadair no longer exists having been absorbed into [[Bombardier Aerospace]], the third largest civil aircraft manufacturer in the world.
