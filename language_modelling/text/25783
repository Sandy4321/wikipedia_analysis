'''Herman's Hermits''' were an [[England|English]] [[rock band]] in the [[1960s]], formed in [[Manchester]] in [[1963 in music|1963]]. Part of the [[British Invasion]], their trademark simple, non-threatening, and clean-cut "boys next door" image made them easier to listen to and more accessible than other British Invasion bands.

== Early history ==
Original members were [[Keith Hopwood]] (guitar, vocals), [[Karl Green]] (bass, vocals), [[Alan Wrigley]] (bass guitar, vocals), [[Steve Titterington]] (drums), and  [[Peter Noone]] (lead vocals). Although the youngest of a remarkably young band, fifteen year old Noone was already a veteran actor, with experience on the British [[soap opera]], ''[[Coronation Street]]''. [[Derek Leckenby|Derek "Lek" Leckenby]] (guitar, vocals), and [[Barry Bean Whitwam]] (drums), joined later from another local group The Wailers. After Leckenby joined the band obtained a deal with producer Mickie Most and signed to EMI records in Europe and MGM records in the United States.

After playing live for a time, they met future producer [[Mickie Most]] and released "[[I'm Into Something Good]]". The band played on the singles "I'm Into Something Good", "Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter" (1965) and "[[I'm Henry the Eighth, I Am|I'm Henry VIII, I Am]]". The last was said at the time to be "the fastest-selling song in history".<ref>MacInnes, Colin (1965) "The Old English Music Hall Songs Are New." ''The New  York Times,'' November 28, 1965, p. SM62: "''Henry''&mdash;which hit the top of the record lists and, according to one American expert, was 'the fastest-selling song in history'&mdash;was in fact an old English music hall song enjoying a new lease on life.</ref>

Despite the band being more than competent as musicians, many of their subsequent singles employed  some session musicians, including [[Jimmy Page]] and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], with contributions from the band, although the role of session players on Herman's Hermits records has been greatly exaggerated in the rock media. This has been made worse by the inaccurate liner notes on the recent ABKCO "Retrospective", which fail to credit the Hermits playing. Leckenby in particular was a gifted guitarist. 

While the band's singles were written by top songwriters of the day, Noone, Leckenby, Hopwood and Green contributed some excellent songs on the band's albums, some of which could have been "A" sides. The songs "My Reservation's Been Confirmed" and "Take Love, Get Love" are standouts. 

Regardless of how the records were made, the band was able to deliver the goods live, as can be evidenced on the 1965 NME Awards Show and on 1966's "Herman's Hermits Hilton Show" which aired on Australian television. Leckenby in particular was able to flesh out the bands songs in concert with numerous guitar fills not readily evident on the recordings.  Copies of both the NME Awards Show and the Australian concert are available from internet sources. 

Despite a tendency to disregard the band in critical circles, all the members were capable players, and Noone was a charismatic front man whose singing ability has often been underrated. 

The band was nominated for two Grammy awards in 1965, both for "Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter." According to Noone and Hopwood , the song was recorded as an afterthought in two takes, using two microphones with Hopwood on guitar, Green on bass and Whitwam on drums. Noone and the band deliberately emphasized their English accents on the record, which was never intended to be a single. Hopwood recalls playing a Gretsch Country Gentleman guitar in the studio with its strings muted in order to create the distinctive sound. When playing the song live, Hopwood often used a Rickenbacker guitar with a rag under the bridge to duplicate the sound. (Noone and Hopwood personal correspondence.) 

The album "Blaze" in 1967 found the group at its best with Leckenby, Hopwood , Green and Noone contributing several fine orginal songs and Noone demostrating an excellent vocal range. The psychedlic "Moon Shine Man" and the rocker "Ace King Queen" being standouts. The album garnered critical acclaim but barely made the top 100 in the U,S, and wasn't released in the U.K.

== Origin of the "Herman" name ==
Born in Manchester, England, Noone was a child TV star playing Stanley Fairclough in ''Coronation Street''. He was also featured in ''Knight Errant'', ''Family Solicitor'' and ''Monro's Saki Stories''. Noone was only 15 when he achieved international fame as teenage heart-throb, Herman. On stage, Noone initially used his existing stage name Peter Novak. The change to Herman came after the owner of a pub that they were rehearsing in, remarked on his resemblance to the character Sherman in ''[[Peabody's Improbable History]]'', a supporting cartoon in ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'', which they misheard as Herman. The group, who by now were a popular [[dance hall]] and [[youth club]] attraction, and managed by [[Harvey Lisberg]] and [[Charlie Silverman]], changed their name to Herman and The Hermits, and it soon became abbreviated to Herman's Hermits.

== Original band ==
Herman's Hermits were hugely successful in the mid-[[1960s]]. Their first hit was "I'm Into Something Good", which reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 13 in the US in 1964. They never topped the British charts again, but had two US No. 1's with "Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter" and "I'm Henry the Eighth, I Am". The band disliked both songs, and never released them as singles in Britain, although Mrs. Brown featured excellent rhythm guitar by Hopwood, and Henry featured an excellent guitar solo by Leckenby. (Peter Noone Interview) They appeared in several movies, including ''When The Boys Meet The Girls'' (1965) and ''Hold On!'' (1966). They appeared on the ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' and ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]''.


=== Peter Noone (Herman) ===
Noone left the band in [[1971]]. He starred in ABC's The Canterville Ghost and played [[Pinocchio]] in Hallmark's Hall Of Fame version of that story. His other TV credits include ''[[Married With Children]]'', ''[[Quantum Leap]]'', ''[[My Two Dads]]'', ''[[Dave's World]]'', ''[[Too Close for Comfort (TV series)|Too Close For Comfort]]'', ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'', ''[[Easy Street]]'' and has a recurring role on ''[[As The World Turns]]''. He also hosted [[VH1]]'s ''My Generation''.In March 2007, he is appearing on the top rated show, American Idol.

As a singer he had a hit with [[David Bowie]]'s, "Oh, You Pretty Things". Later, Noone recorded the album "One of the Glory Boys" for Beach Boy Bruce Johnston's label as well as an album fronting the new wave band "The Tremblers." His song "God Knows" was covered by Debbie Boone.

=== Keith Hopwood ===
Hopwood left as well, starting his own music company, Pluto Music, with Leckenby. [[As of 2007]], Pluto Music is still in business, and works primarily on commercial and animation soundtracks. The studio has provided services to many top acts including [[The Clash]]. Hopwood has released several rare solo and band recordings (not with Peter). Hopwood's releases show a depth to the band not generally perceived. The CDs "Vault 69" and "Waterloo Road" contain original songs written during Herman's Hermits existence. Both are available from Pluto Music. Considering the quality and maturity of these recordings, it is surprising that the Hermits never recorded the material, although perhaps it was due to the band's fan base which was accustomed to more straight ahead pop.

=== Derek Leckenby ===
Lek died in [[1994]] after a  battle with cancer. His final performance was just five days before his death. Lek was a kind man and one of rock's most underrated guitarists. Lek often spoke very well of Peter in interviews as does Hopwood on the VH1 Herman's Hermits  My Generation episode. Leckenby as part of the band "Sour Mash" recorded an album with the former Hermits and Peter Cowap for RCA records which featured Leckenby on dobro and guitar. The album was country flavored rock and was a far cry from earlier Herman's Hermits material.

=== Barry Whitwam ===
Whitwam has continued touring in Europe with a band under the ''Herman's Hermits starring Barry Whitwam'' name.

=== Andrew Mason===
[[In 2007]], Peter Noone and the band had an altercation with Andrew Mason at the Benton Harbor concert in late February. The Hermits have yet to issue an apology.

== Competing "Herman's Hermits" ==

Since the mid 1970's there has been significant conflict over the use of the name Herman's Hermits. Between [[1974]] and [[1994]], Barry and Lek toured with versions of the band that at times included original members Keith and Karl and newer members such as former Toggery Five guitarist, Frank Renshaw and Peter Cowap. After a show in 1985 Lek confided in fans that he missed working with Peter. (Leckenby pers. correspondence). Fans should be warned that several "fake" Hermits records exist. These recordings show up frequently as compilations of Hermits' hits. This problem has been made worse by several small labels hiring musicians to re-record Hermits records. These recordings feature neither Peter Noone nor any original band members. Additionally both former band members and Peter have separately re-recorded old Hermits material. Noone and Whitwam continue to tour seperately. A long standing legal issue remains between Noone and Whitwam over Whitwam's failure to accurately inform the public that his band is "Herman's Hermits Starring barry Whitwam" and not simply "Herman's Hermits", Noone on the other hand makes clear that his band is called "Herman's Hermits Starring Peter Noone" at all shows and on all merchandise. This regrettable situation will probably cause there never to be a reunion of all surviving band members which many fans hope for. Whitwam no longer tours in the United States where Noone makes his base and where Noone is hugely successful on tour and in television.

Noone currently tours worlwide ,to great success,under the billing ''Herman's Hermits, starring Peter Noone'', often appearing at concerts in American state fairs, theaters, and major casinos. 

Peter often fondly credits Leckenby and Hopwood for their work in the Hermits. See Peter Noone's website.
