===Casting===
Fans of actor [[Rupert Hill]] speculated that he claimed that the plot involving on-screen granddad [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]]'s ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) death was unpleasant, this even inspired him to raise cash to help individuals diagnosed with such diseases. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs-old/latest/2006/03/18/exclusive-mike-fall-inspires-rupert-115875-16828787/|title=MIKE'S FALL INSPIRES RUPERT|publisher=[[Sunday Mirror]]|author=Brian Roberts|date=2006-03-18|accessdate=2008-12-23}}</ref>

Based on the sexual relationship between Jamie's character and his step-mum, Rupert Hill claimed that he wasn't quite sure about Jamie's true feeling for Frankie, though he could clarify why Jamie had such feelings, he was concerned about how the stroyline had an uncomfortable atmosphere, he admitted that he and [[Debra Stephenson]], who played Frankie, were wary about filming these scenes, thinking it was sensational and irregular, though the scripts they received were more than interesting. He claimed that it had given he and Debra a new dimension to their relationship, and that the filming was enjoyable as of the deep plot. <ref name="A family affair"/>

He also described the plotline as "fantastic". <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a38470/corrie-actor-praises-fantastic-plot.html|title=Corrie actor praises "fantastic" plot|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|author=Daniel Kilkelly|date=2006-10-22|accessdate=2008-12-23}}</ref>

Following the character's departure, Rupert Hill considered taking on Hollywood, when he was asked to whether or not he would return to ''Coronation Street'', he replied:
