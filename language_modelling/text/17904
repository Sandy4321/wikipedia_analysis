"'''The Long Bright Dark'''" is the [[series premiere]] of the [[anthology series|anthology]] [[crime drama]] ''[[True Detective (TV series)|True Detective]]'', which initially aired on [[Home Box Office|HBO]] in the United States on January 12, 2014. It was directed by executive producer [[Cary Joji Fukunaga]] and written by series creator [[Nic Pizzolatto]]. The episode introduces a pair of [[Louisiana State Police]] homicide detectives, [[Rustin Cohle|Rustin "Rust" Cohle]] ([[Matthew McConaughey]]) and Martin "Marty" Hart ([[Woody Harrelson]]), as well as series regulars played by [[Michelle Monaghan]], [[Michael Potts (actor)|Michael Potts]], and [[Tory Kittles]]. In "The Long Bright Dark", Martin and Rustin are forced to recount the history of the Dora Lange murder investigation as new evidence suggests the perpretator remains at large.

Pizzolatto began writing ''True Detective'' as a novel, but, as the project began taking definite form, felt it was more suitable for television. [[Principal photography]] was initially scheduled to take place in [[Arkansas]]; however, [[Louisiana]] was ultimately preferred for its generous statewide tax incentives and unique landscape. "The Long Bright Dark" was shot entirely in [[35 mm film]] and filming for the season lasted for 100 consecutive days.

Most press reviews for "The Long Bright Dark" were very positive, although some reviewers criticized the dialogue and other aspects of the program. Critics that held the episode in high regard applauded its complex narrative and sleek production, and there was a surfeit of praise for the performances of McConaughey and Harrelson. The initial broadcast of "The Long Bright Dark" drew 2.3 million viewers, becoming HBO's highest rated series premiere since [[Boardwalk Empire (episode)|the pilot episode]] of ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]''.

==Plot==

===2012===
The episode opens with Martin "Marty" Hart ([[Woody Harrelson]]), a homicide detective of the [[Louisiana State Police]]'s Criminal Investigations Division, beginning an interview with detectives Maynard Gilbough ([[Michael Potts (actor)|Michael Potts]]) and Thomas Papania ([[Tory Kittles]]). His former partner, detective [[Rustin Cohle|Rustin "Rust" Cohle]] ([[Matthew McConaughey]]), is being questioned separately; they have not seen nor spoken to each other since an altercation over a decade ago. The two men are asked to recount their relationship and the history of the Dora Lange murder investigation of 1995, the files of which are presumed to have been destroyed in [[Hurricane Rita]]. Martin and Rustin claim to have apprehended the killer, but the crime scene of a recently slain woman is found to closely mirror the Dora Lange murder scene, leading investigators to believe that the perpretrator is still at large.

===1995===
Martin and Rustin are summoned to [[Vermillion Parish, Louisiana|Vermillion Parish]] to examine the murder scene of a young prostitute, 28-year-old Dora Lange. The woman's corpse, crowned with deer [[antlers]] and bound to a tree in a kneeling position, is surrounded by numerous twig [[latticework]]s loosely resembling [[Cajun]] [[bird trapping|bird traps]]. Rustin notices several stab wounds and ligature marks scattered about on the corpse, suspecting Dora to be the centerpiece of a [[ritual murder]]<U+2014>the "paraphiliac love map" to the perpretrator's fantasy. Martin dismisses his suspicions, and suddenly invites Rustin to dinner at his wife Maggie's ([[Michelle Monaghan]]) insistence, much to Rustin dismay as it is his deceased daughter's birthday. However, he reluctantly agrees to come, but infuriates Martin when he shows up to the occasion intoxicated.

Meanwhile, Major Ken Quesada ([[Kevin Dunn]]) immediately sets up a [[press conference]] and assigns Martin responsibility over the briefing session for the following day. Rustin continues the investigation at a bar that evening and asks two prostitutes<U+2014>Anette (Charleigh Harmon) and Lucy (Alyshia Ochse)<U+2014>about Dora's whereabouts, to no avail. By the next morning, there were several breakthroughs in the investigation: Dora's body had been successfully identified, an [[autopsy]] revealed she had been strangled, tortured, and possibly raped, and early toxicology reports found traces of [[lysergic acid]] and [[methamphetamine]] in her bloodstream. Martin, Rustin, and Quesada brief their colleagues with the new evidence.

The duo visit Dora's ex-husband Charlie Lange (Brad Carter) in [[prison]] for questioning. Charlie, incarcerated on charges of [[check fraud]], claims to have not seen the woman since she filed for divorce a year into his prison sentence. He informs the detectives of Dora's risky drug habits as well as the details of his final phone conversation with her.

The investigation takes a brief detour as Martin and Rustin direct their attention to a five-year-old missing-persons case, a little girl named Marie Fontenot, after being mentioned by one of the locals. Authorities believe she is in the care of her father, and during a visit to see her uncle Danny Fontenot (Christopher Berry), his caretaker echoed their beliefs. Rustin searches the property for potential evidence, and while in a shed, stumbles upon a twig sculpture eerily similar to those discovered at the Dora Lange murder scene.

===Development===

An accomplished writer, series creator [[Nic Pizzolatto]] delved into [[fiction writing]] and published a novel, titled ''Galveston'' (2010), before being appointed as a screenwriter for [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]'s ''[[The Killing (U.S. TV series)|The Killing]]'' the following year.

Pizzolatto's stint with ''The Killing'' provided him a glimpse of the inner workings of the television industry, but grew increasingly dissatisfied with the show's creation direction, eventually leaving the writing staff two weeks into the program's second season.

===Filming===
The initial location for [[principal photography]] for ''True Detective'' was [[Arkansas]]; however, Pizzolatto later opted to film in southern [[Louisiana]] to capitalize on [[Film industry in Louisiana|generous statewide tax incentives]] and the area's distinctive landscape,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cenlamar.com/2014/01/16/exclusive-nic-pizzolattos-louisiana/ |title=Exclusive: Nic Pizzolatto<U+2019>s Louisiana|publisher=CenLamar |date= January 16, 2014 |first=Lamar |last=White, Jr. |accessdate=December 25, 2014 }}</ref> which he felt illustrated a striking paradox. "There's a contradictory nature to the place and a sort of sinister quality underneath it all," the native Louisianan noted. "Everything lives under layers of concealment. The woods are thick and dark and impenetrable.

===Critical response===
"The Long Bright Dark" was critically acclaimed by most critics. Tim Goodman from ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said Fukunaga develops "a beautiful, sprawling sense of place" in the premiere, and identified the ensemble and the writing, which he believed "undulates from effectively brash soliloquies to penetratingly nuanced moments carried by sparse prose", as two of its other most satisfying attributes.<ref name=thr2>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/hbos-true-detective-starring-matthew-668182|title=True Detective: TV Review|first=Tim|last=Goodman|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=January 2, 2014|accessdate=December 25, 2014}}</ref> Marshall Crook of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' agreed, writing the show hits the mark with "good acting, smart writing, and lush cinematography".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/01/12/true-detective-season-1-episode-1-the-long-bright-dark-tv-recap/|title='True Detective,' Season 1, Episode 1, 'The Long Bright Dark': TV Recap|first=Marshall|last=Crook|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[News Corp]]|date=January 12, 2014|accessdate=December 28, 2014}}</ref> Willa Paskin of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' described the episode as "creepy, gorgeous, unsettling, and searching" and noticed "a literary quality, an accretion of meaningful detail" within the show's narrative.<ref name=slate>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2014/01/true_detective_on_hbo_starring_matthew_mcconaughey_and_woody_harrelson_reviewed.html|title=True Great|first=Willa|last=Paskin|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|date=January 8, 2014|accessdate=December 25, 2014}}</ref> ''[[The Daily Beast]]''{{'s}} Andrew Romano said the premiere, together with the former half of the season, compose "one of the most riveting and provocative series I've ever seen",<ref name=tdb2>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/11/true-detective-review-you-have-to-watch-hbo-s-revolutionary-crime-classic.html|title=<U+2018>True Detective<U+2019> Review: You Have to Watch HBO<U+2019>s Revolutionary Crime Classic|first=Andrew|last=Romano|work=The Daily Beast|publisher=The Newsweek Daily Beast Company|date=January 11, 2014|accessdate=December 25, 2014}}</ref> while ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' critic Jeff Jensen called it  "an enthralling murder mystery about history, culture, and heroic character".<ref name=ent>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20776204,00.html|title=True Detective (2014)|first=Jeff|last=Jensen|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=February 5, 2014|accessdate=December 25, 2014}}</ref>

Not all critics were as enthusiastic in their reviews of "The Long Bright Dark". Hale, despite commending the flashback narrative, believed the dialogue devolved into "a languid character study and a vehicle for long-winded exchanges about religion and responsibility that are writerly in the worst way."<ref name=nyt/> Chris Cabin from ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' agreed that the writing too readily "defers to an earnest, rote view of bad religion", but wrote that Pizzolatto and Fukunaga "smartly embrace the pulpiness of their material".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/review/true-detective-season-one|title=True Detective: Season One|first=Chris|last=Cabin|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=January 8, 2014|accessdate=December 28, 2014}}</ref> Hank Stuever, writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', observed "mumbly, bloodshot fatigue" in the story, and felt the series fell short of its ambitions.
