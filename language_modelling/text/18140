In [[dinghy]] [[sailing]], a boat is said to be '''turtling''' or to '''turn turtle''' when the boat is fully inverted with the mast pointing down to the lake bottom or seabed.  The name stems from the appearance of the upside-down boat, similar to the shell of a [[sea turtle]]. The term can be applied to any vessel; turning turtle is less frequent but more dangerous on ships than on smaller boats.  It is more hazardous on multihulls.  Measures can be taken to prevent a capsize from becoming a turtle.{{sfn|George|1971|p=82-9}}

==Definition and prevention==
Prevention is the first priority.<ref name="Rosmaniere"/><ref name="f15"/> <ref group=upper-alpha>"A seaman laboring under an undue sense of security becomes at once worth hardly half his salt." {{ndash}} [[Joseph Conrad]]. {{cite book |first1=Joseph |last1=Conrad |authorlink1=Joseph Conrad |title=The Mirror of the Sea |page=18 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=t3hJAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=%22A+seaman+laboring+under+an+undue+sense+of+security+becomes+at+once+worth+hardly+half+his+salt.%22&source=bl&ots=L2dGyVXWWx&sig=NNmcg7TGONfyAbMpyMqQKFmTVig&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YiaOUrLdIKPSyAG05ICwBA&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22A%20seaman%20laboring%20under%20an%20undue%20sense%20of%20security%20becomes%20at%20once%20worth%20hardly%20half%20his%20salt.%22&f=false |accessdate=November 21, 2013}} cited in Rosmaniere at p. 19.</ref>

Turtling commonly occurs when a boat [[capsize]]s and is not righted or attended to in time, allowing it to roll through the approximately 90 degrees of a capsize through to 180 degrees from upright.<ref name="Rosmaniere"/><ref name="f15"/>

Prevention and delay of turtling in dinghies is the highest priority {{mdash}} turtling can be catastrophic in consequences {{mdash}} but it depends on skill, ability and athleticism, which vary greatly.  As [[John Rousmaniere]] wrote: Testing confirms the [[Royal Yachting Association]]'s conclusion that "a decisive way to address entrapment is to immediately right the boat by putting weight on the centerboad."<ref name="Rosmaniere"/> This should be adopted by [[US Sailing]] and other organizations "as doctrine."<ref name="Rosmaniere"/> Thus, reliance on boat handling and [[seamanship]] may be misplaced.<ref name="Rosmaniere"/>  

Sealing masts and attaching flotation are effective preventatives, but not widely utilized.<ref name="Rosmaniere"/><ref name="f15"/>  More certain preventatives for this includes various forms of flotation added to the tip of the mast or top of the mainsail.<ref group=upper-alpha>Intended for "rough weather or novice racers." {{cite web |url=http://www.hartleyboats.com/index.php?id=70&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=202&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=70&cHash=36dc41327bdc7307410d22ab7c0cb7f3 |title=Hartley Wayfarer Mark IV |accessdate=13 November 2013}} Distances and the likelihood of rescue are other factors that should be considered in deciding whether to prepare for the worst.  As [[Franz Kafka]] and [[Huey Lewis and the News]] have written: "It is better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it."</ref> These include floats (e.g., one that looks like a streamlined [[blimp]] used on [[Hobie 16]]s)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sailsportmarine.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=277 |title=Hobie Mast Float {{ndash}} Mama Bob |publisher=Sailboat Marine |accessdate= November 17, 2013}}</ref><ref name="forum">{{cite web |url=http://sailingforums.com/threads/faq-what-should-i-do-to-prevent-turtling.26221/ |title=What Should I do to Prevent Turtling |publisher=sailingforums.com |accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref> or a "sail patch" {{mdash}} a sleeve with built in flotation that fits over the top of the sail, available for example as option on the [[Wayfarer (dinghy)]] Mark IV.  Another alternative is to seal the mast, thereby increasing its [[buoyancy]].<ref name="forum"/> 

As an emergency palliative, putting flotation (''i.e.'', a spare [[life vest]] or other [[personal flotation device]]), onto the end of the mast straight away after a capsize and without delay, can forestall a turtle.  Conversely, climbing onto the side of a knocked down boat can increase the likelihood of turtling, as it moves weight higher over the [[center of gravity]], may also increase windage, and thus can effectively drive the mast downward.<ref name="f15"/>

Several devices have been patented to prevent turtling.<ref name="Legare"/><ref>{{cite patent

==Practice and cure==
Righting a turtled boat is one of the most difficult maneuvers.  Recovery in a monohull requires releasing the [[main sheet]], lowering the [[spinnaker]] if it is deployed, standing on the bottom of the boat and levering on the centerboard, or standing on the centerboard (there may be weight and placement restrictions).  It is important that other members of the crew not be on top the boat, as this can drastically increase resistance to righting the craft.<ref name="f15">{{cite web |url=http://www.fusionboats.com/pdf/FusionRighting.pdf |title=Fusion Capsize Manual |publisher=F-15 dinghy |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=November 18, 2013}}</ref>  The use of "righting ropes" materially aids the process. Standing on the centerboard and "piggybacking" of crew members can be highly effective to right a turtled dinghy, as it increases both the weight and leverage being applied.  Use of powerboats to aid is problematical, and depending on the technique used {{mdash}} there are several {{mdash}} may or may not succeed.<ref name="Rosmaniere">{{cite web |url=http://offshore.ussailing.org/AssetFactory.aspx?vid=19214 |title=Tests of Sailor Retrieval, Capsize Recovery and Entrapment |first1=John |last1=Rousmaniere |authorlink1=John Rousmaniere |publisher=[[US Sailing]] |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |format=[[PDF]]}}</ref>  See [[Capsize#Training|Capsize]].<ref name="hb"/>

==Multihulls==

In [[yacht]] sailing, [[multihull]]s are deemed to be more prone to turtling than [[keel]]ed monohulls, and there is essentially no way to right them if they overturn.  The juxtaposition of the hulls and sail when turtled {{mdash}} it makes them inherently stable when inverted {{mdash}} makes them especially resistant to righting.<ref name="Rosmaniere"/><ref name="Legare"/>  Consequently, some are built with a turtle emergency [[escape hatch]] beneath the hull. Indeed, some locales require such safety hatches.<ref name="Kelsall"/>  There are, however, those who feel that the likelihood of a capsize of a large multihull is overrated.<ref name="Farrier">{{cite web |url=http://www.f-boat.com/safety/ |title=Multihull Safety |publisher=Farrier Marine |first1=Ian |last1=Farrier |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |format=HTML}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tritonsatsea.blogspot.com/2005/05/never-buy-boat-unless-your-friends.html |title=Don't buy a Catamaran, you'll die!! |date=May 30, 2005 |publisher=Triton Boat Works |first2=Ann Marie Powers |last2=Triton |first1=Robb Kane |last1=Triton |accessdate=November 20, 2013 |format=HTML}}</ref>  There are others who state that a self righting multihull is the answer, along with designing in safety and proper operation.<ref name="Kelsall">{{cite web |url=http://www.kelsall.com/TechnicalArticles/KCSeaworthinessAndSafety.pdf |first1=Derek |last1=Kelsall |publisher=Kellsall Catamarans |title=Catamaran Seaworthiness and Safety |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |format=PDF}}</ref>   A patent has been issued specifically concerning righting of turtled large multihulls.<ref name="Lake"/>  It is intended to avoid the necessity to use divers and special equipment in a recovery.<ref name="Lake">{{cite web |url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/4651666/description.html |first1=John A. |last1=Lake |title=Patent 465166 Description, Multi-hull sailboat righter |accessdate=November 20, 2013}}</ref>

It is, however, possible (and often successfully) to right a capsized small multihull, e.g., a [[Beachcat]].  The process begins with positioning ropes so that the crew can get leverage (acting together is key). Righting [[Beachcat|Beach catamaran]]s that are turtled can be extremely difficult.  Loss of sails, rigging, masts and boats can occur.  A singled-handed self rescue can be assisted by carrying a [[garbage bag]] which is filled with water, and thrown over the rescuer's shoulder.<ref name="hb">{{cite web |url=http://www.hobiecat.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=143 |title=Righting a Hobie cat |accessdate=November 21, 2013}}</ref>

Even some large multihulls can be righted at sea {{mdash}} it is a long shot {{mdash}} provided that the skipper is well prepared, knows what he is doing, and has appropriate devices, tools, skills and a workable plan.<ref name="Kelsall"/><ref name="Farrier"/>

==Notable events==

On June 13, 2012, in the trials leading to the [[America's Cup]], [[Oracle Team USA]] on an [[AC45]] spectacularly capsized the boat. and it was righted with minimal damage ("there's a little rip there") ten minutes later.  Skipper [[Russell Coutts]] dismissed it as "a learning experience."  This was an epilogue to earlier similar incidents by other teams in Australia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KNql99zT6s |title=America's Cup: Russell Coutts on AC45 Oracle capsizes spectacularly in San Francisco |publisher=[[Sailing News]] |format=video |accessdate=November 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sail-world.com/USA/Americas-Cup:-Coutts-capsizes-in-San-Francisco---crew-injured-+-Video/84704 |title=America's Cup: Coutts capsizes in San Francisco - crew injured |format=Video |first1=Richard |last1=Gladwell |publisher=Sail-World.com |accessdate=November 19, 2013}}</ref>

On May 9, 2013, the [[2013 America's Cup]] challenger Artemis broke apart, [[Broach (sailing)|broached]]. capsized, and turtled destroying its wing/sail and trapping two crew members under its hull.  The [[AC72]] [[Wingsail|wing-sail]] [[catamaran]] was sailed on behalf of the [[Kungliga Svenska Segels<U+00E4>llskapet|Royal Swedish Yacht Club]] (KSSS), sponsoring [[Team Artemis]]. [[Andrew Simpson (sailor)|Andrew "Bart" Simpson]], an Olympic-gold-medal winning [[United Kingdom|British]] sailor, died as a result.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/09/americas-cup-sailor-dies_n_3248418.html |title=America's Cup Sailor Dies In Boat Capsize |first1=Paul |last1=Elias |first2=Bernie |last2=Wilson |location=San Francisco |date=May 9, 2013 |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/video/americas-cup-boat-capsizes-leaving-1-dead-19146864 |title=America's Cup Boat Capsizes, Leaving 1 Dead |newspaper=[[ABC News]] |date=May 9, 2013 |format=video |accessdate=November 19, 2013}}</ref>

In one notable crash, the high speed experimental [[sailing hydrofoil]] [[trimaran]] [[Hydropt<U+00E8>re]] set a world speed record, then [[pitchpoled]] while going over 60 knots,  The turtled yacht had to be towed back to port for being turned right side up.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catsailingnews.com/2008/12/hydroptere-61knots-and-huge-crash-with.html |title=Hydropt<U+00E8>re: 61 knots and huge crash with 35-38 knots, gusts over 45 |publisher=Catamaran Racing |date=December 22, 2008 |location=[[Fos-sur-Mer]] |accessdate=November 19, 2013}}</ref>

==Legal implications==
Capsize and turtling can result in legal liability for damages due to [[negligence]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2087529/Girl-11-drowned-gust-wind-capsized-sailing-boat-Greece.html |title=Girl, 11, 'drowned after freak gust of wind capsized catamaran, trapping her underwater in harness' |first1=Andy |last1=Dolan |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=17 January 2012 |accessdate=21 November 20123}}</ref>
