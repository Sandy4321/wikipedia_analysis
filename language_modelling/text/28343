'''Zipcar''' is a for-profit, membership-based [[carsharing]] company providing [[automobile]] rental to its members, billable by the hour or day. Zipcar was founded in 1999 by [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] residents [[Robin Chase]] and [[Antje Danielson]]. On October 31, 2007 Zipcar merged with rival [[Flexcar]].<ref name="Zipcar 31OCT07">{{cite web |url=http://www.flexcar.com/Portals/0/10About/PressReleases/pr103107.html |title=Zipcar and Flexcar Agree to Merge |accessdate=2007-10-31 |date=[[2007-10-31]] |work=Press Release |publisher=Flexcar}}</ref> By 2009 Zipcar has become the world's largest car-sharing vice, sharing 6,000 vehicles between 275,000 drivers<ref name=Economist0609/> in 49 U.S. cities, [[Vancouver]], [[Toronto]], and [[London]],

==Membership details== 

Members, called "zipsters", are able to view vehicle availability and reserve a self-service car via the internet or by telephone, in increments as short as one hour and pay only for time they reserve. Zipcar vehicles report their positions to a control center using in-car technology.<ref name=Economist0609/> In the U.S. each reservation entitles the members up to 180 miles for each each 24 hour period,<ref name="learnmore">{{cite web |url=http://www.zipcar.com/111welcome/learnmore-22 |title=Zipcar : Flexcar : Member Q&A |accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref>) while Canadian members receive up to 200 kilometers with each reservation for the first 24 hours, and 15 kilometers per each additional hour beyond the initial 24.<ref name="Zipcar: Vancouver, BC - FAQ">{{cite web |url=http://www.zipcar.com/how/faqs/one-faq?faq_number=57 |title=Zipcar ... frequently asked questions |accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref> Each vehicle has a home location: a reserved parking space located on a street, driveway, or neighborhood parking lot in the member's area. Individual members can sign up for one of two different plans, the "Occasional Driving Plan" and the "Extra Value Plan".<ref name="learnmore"/> 
[[File:Zipcar DC 4996 03 2009.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Zipcar in downtown [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
Members are given an [[RFID|access card]] containing a wireless chip, called a "Zipcard", which will open the vehicle they have reserved only at the time they have reserved it.<ref name=Economist0609/> Each vehicle records hours of usage and milage, which is uploaded to a central computer via a [[wireless]] [[data]] link. The location of the vehicles is not tracked during a reservation for privacy reasons but is trackable and all cars are equipped with a "kill" function that allows the company to prevent the car from starting in the event of theft (it does not cause the car to turn off, for safety reasons).{{Fact|date=February 2008}} The reservation includes [[vehicle insurance|driver's insurance]], a gas card for the car, and reimbursements for typical car maintenance items like car washes and window wiper fluid refills. When someone becomes a member, they can automatically reserve and use a Zipcar in any Zipcar city.

On May 1, 2007, Zipcar announced that it was ending its partnership with [[XM Radio]] and the service would be removed from its cars over the subsequent two months.<ref name="xmgone">{{cite web |url=http://mediabiz.blogs.cnnmoney.cnn.com/2007/05/01/zipcar-drops-xm/

Additionally, the Z2B program provides discounts on Monday - Friday driving. They have also partnered with over 30 colleges and universities to provide students with access to their car sharing service on or near campus, the first being the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].

{{See|Plug-in hybrids in California}}
In February 2009 was announced the launch of a pilot project to promote [[plug-in hybrid vehicle]]s in Zipcar's fleet in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. This pilot is a partnership between Zipcar and the [[City of San Francisco]]. The vehicle showcased during the announcement was a [[Toyota Prius]] converted for plug-in capabilities with range of up to 30-40 miles of electrically assisted driving on a single charge.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sustainablebusiness.com/index.cfm/go/news.display/id/17703|title=Zipcar, San Francisco Launch Plug-in Hybrid Pilot Program|publisher=Sustainable Bussiness|date=2009-02-19|accessdate=2009-06-05}}</ref><ref name=GCC>{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/02/zipcar-launches.html|title=Zipcar Launches Pilot PHEV Program in San Francisco|publisher=Green Car Congress|date=2009-02-19|accessdate=2009-06-05}}</ref> The program is aimed to provide Zipcar members with a convenient and cost-effective way to test drive PHEVs.<ref name=GCC/> The city installed a plug-in charging stations in front of [[San Francisco City Hall]] that can be used by the existing fleet of municipal plug-in vehicles and also for plug-in hybrids available through Zipcar and [[City CarShare]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/19/electric-vehicle-charging-stations-for-san-francisco/?scp=3&sq=Zipcar%20San%20Francisco&st=cse|title=Electric-Vehicle Charging Stations for San Francisco|publisher=[[New York Times]]|author=Tom Zeller Jr|date=2009-02-19|accessdate=2009-06-05}}</ref>

For members under 21, Zipcar provides insurance coverage at state-mandated levels.

Insurance coverage may vary depending on the region of use. For example, Canadian members in Toronto, ON are provided with $1,000,000 in liability coverage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zipcar.com/toronto/apply/rules-of-vehicle-use |title=Zipcar: Toronto, ON Terms and Conditions |accessdate=2008-05-18}}</ref> Vancouver, BC members are provided with $2,000,000 in liability coverage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zipcar.com/vancouver/apply/rules-of-vehicle-use |title=Zipcar: Vancouver, BC Terms and Conditions |accessdate=2008-05-18}}</ref> Both regions in Canada also include comprehensive and collision coverage in addition to liability insurance.
