'''Hanpu''' ({{zh|t=<U+51FD><U+666E>|p=H<U+00E1>np<U+01D4>}}) or  '''Hambo''' ({{lang-ko|<U+D568><U+BCF4>}}), later '''Wanyan Hanpu''', was a leader of the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Wanyan]] clan in the early tenth century. According to the ancestral story of the Wanyan clan, Hanpu came from [[Goryeo]] ([[Korea]]) when he was sixty years old, reformed Jurchen [[customary law]], and then married a sixty-year-old local woman who bore him three children. His descendants eventually united Jurchen tribes into a federation and established the [[Jin Dynasty, 1115<U+2013>1234|Jin dynasty]] in 1115. In 1136 or 1137, Hanpu was retrospectively given the [[temple name]] '''Jin Shizu''' ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+91D1><U+59CB><U+7956>}}), or "'''first ancestor of Jin'''."

Chinese historians have long debated whether Hanpu was of [[Silla]], Goryeo, or Jurchen [[ethnicity]]. Since the 1980s, they have chiefly argued that he was a Jurchen who had lived in Silla, the state that had dominated the [[Korean peninsula]] until it was destroyed by Goryeo in 935. Western scholars usually treat Hanpu's story as a legend, but agree that it hints to contacts between some Jurchen clans and the states of Goryeo and [[Balhae]] (a state located between Jurchen lands and Silla until it was destroyed in 926) in the early tenth century.

==Name==
Hanpu is known under different [[transliteration]]s in Chinese sources. He is called '''Kanfu''' ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+9F95><U+798F>}}) in the ''Records of Things Heard in Songmo'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+677E><U+6F20><U+7D00><U+805E>}}; after 1155), the memoirs of a [[Song Dynasty|Song Chinese]] ambassador who was forced to stay in [[Jurchen Jin|Jin]] territory for more than 10 years starting in 1131. The ''Shenlu Ji'' {{lang|zh-Hant|<U+795E><U+9E93><U+8A18>}}, a lost book cited in the ''Collected Documents on the Treaties with the North during Three Reigns'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+4E09><U+671D><U+5317><U+76DF><U+6703><U+7DE8>}}; {{circa}} 1196), refers to him as '''Kenpu''' ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+63AF><U+6D66>}}), whereas ''Research on the Origin of the Manchus'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+6EFF><U+6D32><U+6E90><U+6D41><U+8003>}}; 1777) calls him '''Hafu''' ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+54C8><U+5BCC>}}).{{sfn|Chen|1960|pp=37<U+2013>38}}

==Ancestor of the Wanyan clan==
Because the early Jurchens had no written records, the story of Hanpu was first transmitted orally.{{sfn|Franke|1994|p=219}} According to the ''[[History of Jin]]'' (compiled in the 1340s), Hanpu arrived from [[Goryeo]] at the age of sixty and settled among the Jurchen Wanyan clan.{{sfn|Franke|1990|pp=414<U+2013>15. ''[[History of Jin]]'', chapter 1 (Beijing: [[Zhonghua Book Company|Zhonghua shuju]], 1974), p. 2. (Original passage: {{lang|zh-Hant|<U+91D1><U+4E4B><U+59CB><U+7956><U+8AF1><U+51FD><U+666E><U+FF0C><U+521D><U+5F9E><U+9AD8><U+9E97><U+4F86><U+FF0C><U+5E74><U+5DF2><U+516D><U+5341><U+9918><U+77E3>}})}} Other sources claim that Hanpu was from [[Silla]], the state that had ruled the Korean peninsula since 668 but that was destroyed by Goryeo in 935.{{sfn|Zhao|2006|pp=68<U+2013>69}} The same story recounts that when Hanpu left Goryeo, his two brothers remained behind, one in Goryeo and one in the [[Balhae]] area.{{sfn|Mote|1999|p=212}} Because the Jurchens considered Hanpu to be the sixth-generation ancestor of [[Wanyan Wugunai]] (1021<U+2013>1074), historians postulate that Hanpu lived in the early tenth century, when the [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]] still consisted of independent tribes, or sometime between the founding of Goryeo in 918 and its destruction of Silla in 935.{{sfnm|Mote|1999|1p=212 ("little more than 100 years before the time of Wugunai")|Franke|1981|2p=219 ("beginning of the 10th century A.D.")|Franke|1994|3p=219 ("around the year 900, which is about when the Jurchens appear on the diplomatic scene")|Tillman|1995|4p=25 ("early 10th cent.")|Menggutuoli|2000|5p=65 (around 921, that is, 100 years before the birth of Wugunai)|Wang|2010|6p=251, note 3 (Silla<U+2013>Goryeo transition), citing {{harvnb|Jin|1969}}}}

The Wanyan clan then belonged to a group of Jurchen tribes that Chinese and [[Khitan people|Khitan]] documents called "Raw" or "Uncivilized" (''sh<U+0113>ng'' {{lang|zh-Hant|<U+751F>}}).{{sfn|Franke|1994|p=219}} These "Uncivilized Jurchens" lived between the [[Changbai Mountains]] in the south (now at the border between [[North Korea]] and [[Northeast China]]) and the [[Sungari River]] in the north, outside the territory of the rising [[Liao dynasty]] (907<U+2013>1125) and little influenced by Chinese culture.{{sfn|Chan|2003|p=3}}

To resolve an endless cycle of [[feud|vendettas]] between two clans, Hanpu managed to make both parties accept a new rule: from then on, the family of a killer would compensate the victim's relatives with a gift of horses, cattle, and money.{{sfn|Franke|1994|p=218}} Historian [[Herbert Franke (sinologist)|Herbert Franke]] has compared this aspect of Jurchen [[customary law]] to the old [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] practice of [[Wergeld]].{{sfn|Franke|1981|p=219}} As a reward for putting an end to the feuds, Hanpu was married to a sixty-year-old woman who then bore him one daughter and two sons.{{sfn|Franke|1990|pp=414<U+2013>15}} A lost book called the ''Shenlu Ji'' states that Hanpu's wife was 40 years old.{{sfn|He|2004|p=37}} Hanpu and his descendants were then formally received into the Wanyan clan.{{sfn|Franke|1990|pp=414<U+2013>15}}

==Hanpu's ethnicity==
Chinese scholars have debated the [[ethnicity]] of Hanpu. They usually agree that Hanpu's "coming from Goryeo" does not mean he was of Goryeo ethnicity, since the Goryeo territory was populated by several ethnic groups.{{sfnm|Wang|2010|1p=250|Menggutuoli|2000|2p=65|Zhao|2006|3p=71}} The people of the time did not always distinguish between state and ethnic group, so that in modern terms Hanpu may have been a Jurchen from the state of Silla, a man of Goryeo, or a Silla man.{{sfn|Sun|1987|p=81}}

Chinese historian Jin Yufu (1887<U+2013>1962) was aware that historical documents claim that Hanpu was either from Goryeo or from Silla, and found both views worthy of consideration.{{sfnm|Wang|2010|1p=251, note 3|Menggutuoli|2000|2p=65 (both citing the same passage from {{harvnb|Jin|1969}})}} Many historians have accepted the claim found in ''Records of Things Heard in Songmo'' and other sources like [[Ma Duanlin]]'s ''[[Wenxian Tongkao]]'' (1317) that Hanpu was "a man of Silla".{{sfn|Zhao|2006|pp=68-69}} The annals of [[Yejong of Goryeo|king Yejong]] (r. 1105<U+2013>1122) in the ''[[Goryeosa|History of Goryeo]]'' report that Wanyan Wugunai's son [[Wanyan Yingge|Yingge]] (<U+76C8><U+6B4C>; 1053-1103) considered Goryeo as his "parent country" ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+7236><U+6BCD><U+4E4B><U+90A6>}}) because his clan's ancestor Hanpu had come from Goryeo.<ref>''[[Goryeosa|History of Goryeo]]'', fascicle 13, under the 6th month of Yejong's 4th year of reign (i.e., 1108). Cited in {{harvnb|Wang|2010|p=251}}, note 3.</ref> However, such a statement may have been part of the Jurchens' diplomatic efforts to obtain Goryeo's help in fighting the Khitan Liao.{{sfnm|Wang|2010|1p=251, note 3|Zhao|2006|2p=74}}

Historian Sun Jinji has claimed that Hanpu's surname was already Wanyan before he moved from Goryeo, and that he was therefore a Jurchen whose family had lived in Silla and then Goryeo before moving back to Jurchen land.{{sfn|Sun|1987|p=81}} Chinese historians Menggutuoli and Zhao Yongchun both argue that Hanpu's ancestors were Jurchens who had lived in Silla and had been absorbed into Goryeo after the latter defeated Silla.{{sfnm|Menggutuoli|2000|1pp=65<U+2013>67|Zhao|2006|2p=68}}

Western scholars usually consider Hanpu's story legendary. Herbert Franke explains that this Jurchen "ancestral legend" probably indicates that the Wanyan clan absorbed immigrants from Goryeo and Balhae sometime in the tenth century.{{sfn|Franke|1990|pp=414<U+2013>15}} [[Frederick W. Mote]], who calls this account of the founding of the Wanyan clan a "tribal legend", claims that Hanpu's two brothers (one who stayed in Goryeo and one in Balhae) might have represented "the tribe's memory of their ancestral links to these two peoples."{{sfn|Mote|1999|p=212}}

==Legacy==
[[File:Wanggiyan Aguda.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Emperor Taizu of Jin|Aguda]], eighth-generation descendant of Hanpu, founded the [[Jurchen Jin|Jin dynasty]] in 1115]]
The Wanyan clan rose to prominence among the Jurchens after 1000 CE.{{sfn|Franke|1990|p=414}} It was Hanpu's sixth-generation descendant Wanyan Wugunai (1021<U+2013>1074) who started to consolidate the dispersed Jurchen tribes into a federation.{{sfn|Franke|1994|p=219}} Wugunai's grandson [[Emperor Taizu of Jin|Aguda]] (1068<U+2013>1123) defeated the Jurchens' Khitan overlords of the Liao dynasty and founded the [[Jurchen Jin Dynasty|Jin dynasty]] in 1115.{{sfn|Franke|1994|p=221}} In 1136 or 1137, soon after [[Emperor Xizong of Jin]] (r. 1135<U+2013>1150) had been crowned, Hanpu was given the [[posthumous name]] "Jingyuan Emperor" ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+666F><U+5143><U+7687><U+5E1D>}}) and the [[temple name]] "Shizu" ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+59CB><U+7956>}}), or "first ancestor."{{sfn|Franke|1994|pp=219 (for the date) and 313 (for translation of the title "Shizu"); ''[[History of Jin]]'', chapter 1 (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1974), p. 3}} In 1144 or 1145, Hanpu's burial site was named "Guangling" ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+5149><U+9675>}}).<ref>''[[History of Jin]]'', chapter 1 (Beijing, Zhonghua shuju, 1974), p. 3.</ref> In December 1145 or January 1146, his posthumous title was augmented to that of "Yihui Jingyuan Emperor" ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+61FF><U+61B2><U+666F><U+5143><U+7687><U+5E1D>}}).<ref>''[[History of Jin]]'', chapter 32 (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1974), p. 779, specifies the date as the [[intercalary month|intercalary]] 11th month of the 5th year of the Huangtong {{lang|zh-Hant|<U+7687><U+7D71>}} era; that month spanned from 16 December 1145 to 13 January 1146.</ref>
