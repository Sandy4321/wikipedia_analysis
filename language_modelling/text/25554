According to [[Philip D. Curtin]], '''Trading Diasporas''' <U+201C>are communities of merchants living among aliens in associated networks<U+201D>.<ref>Gosch, Steve. "Cross Cultural Trade as a Framework for Teaching World History: Concepts and Applications." ''The History Teacher'' 27, no. 4 (1994): 427.</ref>

==History==
Trading [[Diasporas]] were formed as a result of [[international trade]] that resulted in the settlement of [[merchant]]s in certain countries where they sold their products. Their importance to the global world was marked by their impact on the spread of cultures and ideologies of certain areas to the rest of the world. First mention of Trading Diasporas dates back around 2000 BCE when the [[Assyria]]n merchants traveled to the [[Anatolian Peninsula]] in order to sell their goods.<ref>Gosch, 427</ref> Trading Diasporas in this period of time were created as a result of the Assyrian traders staying as <U+201C>semi-permanent residents<U+201D> in cities of the Anatolian peninsula. According to Steve Gosch of the [[University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Eau Claire]] divides the Assyrian traders into <U+201C>stayers<U+201D> and <U+201C>movers.<U+201D><ref>Gosch , 428</ref> Gosch further explains that <U+201C>stayers<U+201D> were the merchants who permanently settled on the [[Anatolian peninsula]] while <U+201C>movers<U+201D> traveled back and forth in order to sell their goods.

According to Jane Schneider, the [[merchants]] trading prior to 15th century were able to create <U+201C>[[asymmetrical]] links between world regions.<U+201D><ref name="Gosch , 429">Gosch , 429</ref> [[Barry Gillis]] and [[Andre Gunder Frank]] go on to say that <U+201C>the earliest world system contained the essential features of its modern counterpart: asymmetrical relationships between regions in the core and periphery, continuing struggles for [[hegemony]] within the core and alternating periods of expansion and contraction in the system as a whole.<U+201D><ref name="Gosch , 429"/> This means that the relations between different regions in the early modern world were not perfect and differed from the international relations of the modern time. Trading [[Diasporas]] were able to create cultural and economical ties with different regions rather than a political relationship.

==Causes==
There are several reasons for the creation of Trading [[Diasporas]] some of which included a demand for products that were not available in particular regions of the world, the division of the world into small [[city states]] who wanted to create economic and cultural ties with the rest of the world and the willingness of people living in certain areas to create their communities abroad and to be represented by them. As Gosch explains <U+201C>[[premodern]] world system was to some extent an <U+201C>[[archipelago]] of towns<U+201D> in which [[Urban area|urban]] centers in [[Europe]] ([[Bruges]], [[Ghent]], [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]]), the [[Middle East]] ([[Cairo]], [[Aden]], and [[Hormuz, Iran|Hormuz]]), and [[Asia]] ([[Samarkand]], [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], [[Kanchipuram]], [[Malacca]], [[Quanzhou]] and [[Hangzhou]]) were connected to one another by trade and shared in a common culture of [[commerce]].<U+201D><ref name="Gosch , 429"/> Strong empires like [[China]] and several [[European states]] were also using the merchants to create trading [[Diasporas]] in order to gather information about a certain country and possibly exploit it either in the event of conflict or just for sociable reasons. Long distance trade at this time mainly <U+201C>dealt largely if not exclusively with [[luxury goods]] or high value relative to their bulk.<U+201D><ref>Bentley, Jerry H. "Cross Cultural interaction and [[Periodization]] in [[World History]]." ''[[The American Historical Review]]'' 101, no. 3 (1996): 752.</ref> Therefore protection of Trading Diasporas in the countries where Diasporas settled was important as it guaranteed supply of [[luxury good|luxury]] products into the country.

==Jewish diaspora==
The [[Jewish Diaspora]] in [[India]] in an area called [[Goa]] is considered one of the oldest and strongest of the Early Modern World Diasporas. The [[human migration|migration]] of [[Jews]] to [[India]] can be marked by the discovery of the route to [[India]] through the South African coast by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]].<ref>Fischel, Walter J. "Leading [[Jews]] in the Service of Portuguese [[India]]." The Jewish quarterly review 47, no. 1 (1956): 37</ref> As Walter Fischel, the author of Leading [[Jews]] in the service of Portuguese [[India]] notes <U+201C>Already in 1498 there appeared in the vicinity of [[Goa]] on the island of [[Anjediva]] the first Western [[Jew]] to play a role in the Portuguese [[India]]n history.<U+201D><ref name="Fischel , 38">Fischel , 38</ref> Prior to the diamond trade, [[Jews]] in [[Portugal]] were employed as [[letter carriers]], [[translators]] and agents.<ref name="Fischel , 38"/> As the Portuguese expansion in [[India]] continued, [[Jews]] were able to create their own communities and practice their [[religious traditions]]. As [[Netherlands|Dutch]] traveler J. Van Linschoten noted <U+201C>There are great numbers of Moores and [[Jews]] in all places of [[India]] as at [[Goa]], [[Cochin]] and within the land<U+2026> amongst the [[India]]ns they have their [[Synagogues]]<U+2026> wherein they use all ceremonies according to their law.<U+201D><ref>Fischel , 39</ref> Linschoten<U+2019>s statement clearly explains that Spanish Muslims<U+2013>[[Moors]] and [[Jews]] were able to practice their religions in [[India]]. This meant that they were able to create communities within the [[India]]n peninsula and preserve their culture and religion. Such cases strongly suggest that rather than living like [[India]]ns, [[Jews]] created Diasporas which helped them preserve their identity. [[Jews]] in [[India]] were able to trade and practice their religion unlike in [[Europe]], where they were oppressed and killed. This meant that <U+201C>a [[Jew]] could rise to power and prominence in public life and could become an agent and diplomat in the service of the Portuguese viceroy in [[Goa]].<U+201D><ref>Fischel , 40</ref>

As Fischel states [[Jews]] were also used by the Portuguese to negotiate with the [[Muslim]] rulers of [[India]]. This was due to the <U+201C>skill, knowledge and linguistic abilities of non-Christians.<U+201D><ref>Fischel , 43</ref>
COMMENT: Actually the most important part of the Jewish diaspora in [[India]] was along the South West Coast, from [[Goa]] in the North to [[Quilon]] (Kailam) in the South. [[Goa]] was only one portion of the diaspora. Dan Koch

==Surat==
[[Surat]] was a city in [[Gujarat]] which at the time of the Portuguese conquest on the northern shores of [[India]] became one of the most important trading centers of [[Asia]]. [[Jewish Diaspora]] was closely related to [[Surat]] as [[Jewish]] [[merchants]] plied their [[commerce]] through [[Surat]]. They, for the most part were jewelers and [[diamond]] merchants.<ref name="Fischel, 47">Fischel, 47</ref>

<U+201C>They came from many parts of the world, from [[Constantinople]], [[Safed]], [[Baghdad]] and [[Portugal]], [[Italy]] and [[England]], as well as from [[Yemen]], [[Persia]] and Jewish [[colony]] at [[Cochin]]<U+2013>all attracted by the great economic potential and possibilities of [[Surat]].<U+201D><ref name="Fischel, 47"/> Therefore [[Surat]] can be considered to be one of the largest centers of Jewish trading and [[Diaspora]].

==Significance==
[[Trade|Trading]] [[diasporas]] were important in a way that they were crucial in a process of establishing long-distance trade, <U+201C>transfers of [[technology]], imperial and [[colonialism|colonial]] ventures, [[missionary]] campaigns, the [[transatlantic slave trade]], and the development of global [[capitalism]]."<ref>Bentley, p.752</ref> Therefore Trading [[diasporas]] were not always a positive community as it led to the establishment of the [[slave trade]] and [[colonialism]].{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} However, the interaction between the different nations and long distance trade which was made possible by the existence of Trading [[diasporas]] was an important vanguard as it led to the development of [[global markets]]. In addition to the development of [[global markets]] Trading [[diasporas]] also triggered an exchange of [[cultures]], ideas and [[technology]] between the host country and the [[merchant]].
