'''Charles Allan Stuart''' (August 3, 1864 - died March  5, 1926) was a Canadian politician and jurist in the province of [[Alberta]].

==Early life==

Stuart was born in [[Caradoc, Ontario|Caradoc]], [[Ontario]] on August 13, 1894.<ref name="U of A">{{cite web |url=http://www.ualbertacentennial.ca/organization/chancellors/stuart.html |title=Charles Allan Stuart, 1908 <U+2013> 1926 |publisher=[[University of Alberta]] |accessdate=October 30, 2009}}</ref>  He attended Middlesex County College and then the [[University of Toronto]], graduating from the latter in 1891 with a gold medal in classics;<ref name="Calgary">{{cite web |url=http://www.calgary.ca/DocGallery/BU/cityclerks/caldermen.pdf |page=41 |title=Corporate Records, Archives |publisher=City of Calgary |accessdate=October 30, 2009}}</ref> he subsequently lectured there in constitutional history.<ref>Thomas 35</ref>  He graduated from [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] in 1894 with a [[Bachelor of Laws]], and was admitted to the [[Law Society of Upper Canada]] in 1896.<ref name="U of A"/>

He practiced briefly in Ontario before falling ill, prompting him to travel to Mexico to recuperate.<ref name="U of A"/>  In the spring of 1897, he travelled west to stay at his brother's ranch.  In February 1898, he moved to Calgary and set up a law practice with Peter McCarthy, K.C.  McCarthy died in 1901, at which time Stuart joined Sifton and Short, one of whose partners was future [[Premier of Alberta]] [[Arthur Sifton]].<ref name="Calgary"/>

==Political career==
Stuart first sought political office when he ran in [[West Calgary (N.W.T. electoral district)|West Calgary]], a district in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories]], in a by-election variously identified as taking place in March 1900<ref name="U of A"/><ref name="Calgary"/> or on March 22, 1901.<ref name="by-election"/>  He was soundly defeated by future [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[R. B. Bennett]].<ref name="by-election"/>  Stuart was elected alderman on the Calgary city council in the December 1904 election, and served from January 2, 1905 until January 2, 1906.<ref name="Calgary"/>

During the lead-up to [[Alberta]]'s 1905 creation as a province, Stuart was initially critical of the terms imposed by the Liberal federal government of [[Wilfrid Laurier]]; these terms kept control of natural resources, which was held by the provincial governments of the older provinces, under federal control.  Stuart was a Liberal, however, and he eventually joined his party in defending these terms.<ref>Thomas 11</ref>  He was less sanguine about Alberta's new electoral boundaries, which disproportionately favoured the province's north, and about the Liberals' policy of fixing Calgary's rival [[Edmonton]] as the interim provincial capital, with the first legislature to make the final decision<U+2014>he felt that the issue should be put to a vote in the first provincial election.  He lost both of these fights, and once again loyally adhered to his party's program.<ref>Thomas 13<U+2013>14</ref>

When Alberta became a province, Stuart became secretary of the [[Alberta Liberal Party|Alberta Liberal Association]], and he played a significant role in the Liberal campaign in the [[Alberta general election, 1905|1905 provincial election]].<ref name="Calgary"/>  He ran as the Liberals' candidate in [[Gleichen (electoral district)|Gleichen]] that election, and defeated [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] John W. Hayes 667 votes to 640.<ref name="1905 results"/>  As MLA, Stuart advocated for Calgary's selection as permanent capital (among other arguments, he pointed out Calgary's proximity to the beautiful [[Rocky Mountains]]).<ref>Thomas 38</ref>

Stuart's time in the legislature came to a close after less than a year, when in October 1906 he resigned to take up a judgeship on the [[Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories]]; when Alberta created [[Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta|its own court]] the following year, he became one of its first judges.<ref name="U of A"/>

==Life after politics==
In 1921, Stuart was elevated to the Supreme Court's newly created [[Court of Appeal of Alberta|Appellate Division]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legalarchivessociety.ab.ca/Architypes/Architypes15_2.pdf |title=Family Tree of Court of Appeal of Alberta |work=Architypes |date=Winter 2006/2007 |publisher=Legal Archives Society of Alberta |page=6 |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>  While sitting on this court, he upheld a trial decision convicting a prostitute, who appealed on the basis that the magistrate who convicted her, Alice Jamieson, was, by virtue of being a women, not legally a person and therefore ineligible to serve as magistrate.  This decision was a prelude to the famous [[Persons Case]], which found that Canadian women were indeed persons.<ref>{{cite web |title=Women in the legal profession |publisher=Legal Archives Society of Alberta |url=http://www.archivesalberta.org/women/LASA/index.html |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>

Stuart became the first Chancellor of the [[University of Alberta]] in 1908, and served until his death; the university awarded him an honorary [[doctorate of laws]] in 1915.  Charles Stuart died March 5, 1926.<ref name="U of A"/>
