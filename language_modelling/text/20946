'''Wuffa''' (ruled from 571 to 578, according to [[Roger of Wendover]]) may have been an early ruler the [[Kingdom of East Anglia]], an independent and long-lived [[Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom which today includes the English counties of [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]]. By tradition Wuffa was named as the son of [[Wehha of East Anglia|Wehha]] and the father of [[Tytila of East Anglia|Tytila]], but it is not known with any certainty that Wuffa was an actual historical figure. The name ''Wuffa'' was the [[eponym]] for the [[Wuffingas|Wuffingas dynasty]], the ruling royal family of the East Angles until 749.

[[Bede]] regarded Wuffa as the first king of the East Angles, but the author of the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', writing a century later, named Wehha as the first ruler.

== Background ==

[[Image:East Anglian kingdom.svg|150px|thumb|left|A topographical map of the [[Kingdom of East Anglia|kingdom of the East Angles]]]] 
The kingdom of the East Angles was an independent and long-lived Anglo-Saxon kingdom that was established after migrants arrived in southeast Suffolk from the area now known as [[Jutland]]. Rainbird Clarke identified Wehha as one of the leaders of the new arrivals: the East Angles are tentatively identified with the [[Geats]] of the [[Old English]] poem ''[[Beowulf]]''.<ref>Rainbird Clarke, ''East Anglia'', pp. 138-139.</ref> Historians have used sources such as the ''[[Anglian collection]]'' to as an aid in calculating a date for the establishment of the kingdom. Collingwood and Myers note the use of both literacy sources and archaeological finds as evidence in how the region was settled during and after the 5th century, when various disparate groups arrived in Norfolk and Suffolk from different parts of the coast and the rivers of the Fens.<ref>Collingwood and Myers, ''Roman Britain and English Settlements'', pp. 389-390.</ref>

The kingdom of the East Angles was bordered to the north and east by the [[North Sea]], to the south by mainly impenetrable forests and by the [[Fens]] marshes on its western border. The main land route from East Anglia would at that time have been a corridor, along which ran the prehistoric [[Icknield Way]].<ref>Collingwood & Myres, ''Roman Britain and English Settlements'', p. 391.</ref> The [[Devil's Dyke, Cambridgeshire|Devil's Dyke]] (near modern [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]]) may have at one time formed part of the kingdom's western boundary, but its construction cannot be dated accurately enough to establish it as of Anglo-Saxon origin.<ref>Carver, ''The Age of Sutton Hoo'', p. 6.</ref>


== Pedigree and reign ==

[[Image:East Anglian tally (Textus Roffensis).png|100px|thumb|'Wuffa Wehhing', as recorded in the ''[[Textus Roffensis]]'' ]]
According to the East Anglian dynastic tally in the ''Anglian collection'', Wuffa was the son of Wehha and the father of Tytila.<ref>Plunkett, ''Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times'', p. 63.</ref> His name, which is a diminutive form of the Old English word for [[wolf]], is the eponym for his dynasty, the Wuffingas, (which taken literally, means 'the kin of Wuffa').<ref>Plunkett, ''Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times'', p. 61.</ref><ref name="W-70">Warner, ''The Origins of Suffolk'', p. 70.</ref> It has been suggested that Wuffa and his dynasty may possibly have originated from  a [[Germanic tribe]] known as the [[Warini|Warni]]: Wuffa has been identified with the 'King of the Angli', as depicted by the [[Byzantine]] scholar [[Procopius]].  According to Procopius, a 6th century Warni prince called Radiger was brotrothed to the sister of the 'King of the Angli'.<ref name=W-70 /> The historian [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]] has suggested that before the arrival of Wuffa's dynasty in Britain, it had been founded by "some powerful and important warrior" that was of an ancient royal line.<ref>Wood, ''In Search of the Dark Ages'', pp. 62-63.</ref> 

According to the 13th century [[chronicle]]r Roger of Wendover, Wuffa ruled from 571 to 578,<ref>Giles, J. A., ''Roger of Wendover's Flowers of History'', volume 1, pp. 49-50.</ref> but the origin of his information is unknown.<ref>Fryde, ''Chronology'', p. 8.</ref> According to Michael Wood, current evidence suggests that Wuffa ruled the East Angles in around 575.<ref>Wood, ''In Search of the Dark Ages'', p. 62.</ref> 

Bede named Wuffa as the grandfather of R<U+00E6>dwald, "from whom the East Anglian kings are called Wuffingas",<ref name=W-70 /> but his view that Wuffa was the first King of the East Angles is contradicted by the 9th century ''Historia Brittonum'', which instead apparently names a person called Guillem Guercha. In the ''Historia Brittonum'', Guillem Guercha is listed as part of a long pedigree: 

<blockquote>Woden begat Casser, who begat Titinon, who begat Trigil, who begat Rodmunt, who begat Rippa, who begat Guillem Guercha, who was the first king of the East Angles.  Guercha begat Uffa, who begat Tytillus, who begat Eni, who begat Edric, who begat Aldwulf, who begat Elric.<ref>Nennius, ''History of the Britons'', section 59.</ref>
</blockquote>

The 19th century historian [[Francis Palgrave|Sir Francis Palgrave]] confused matters when he stated that, "''Guercha'' is a distortion of the name Uffa, or Wuffa, arising in the first instance from the pronunciation of the British writer, and in the next place from the error of the transcriber".<ref>Palgrave, ''The Rise and Progress of the English Commonwealth'', p. 413, note 2.</ref> D. P. Kirby has however concluded that Nennius intended to mean that it was Wehha, and not Wuffa, who was the earliest Wuffingas king.<ref>Kirby, ''The Earliest English Kings'', p. 15.</ref>

A lack of documentary evidence prevents scholars from knowing if Wuffa is anything more than a legendary figure and the true identity of the first East Anglian king cannot be known with certainty.<ref>Carver, ''The Age of Sutton Hoo'', p.5.</ref> The historian [[Martin Carver]] has argued that Wuffa is "best regarded as an emblematic figure personified from royal origin-myth" <ref>Carver, ''The Age of Sutton Hoo'', p. 71.</ref>

Later East Anglian kings claimed their right to rule by being descended from Wuffa, in the same way that the [[Kingdom of Kent|Kentish kings]] claimed descent from [[Oisc of Kent|Oisc]].<ref>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 61.</ref>
