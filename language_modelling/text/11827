'''Sai Wan War Cemetery''' ({{zh-c|c=<U+897F><U+7063><U+570B><U+6BA4><U+7D00><U+5FF5><U+58B3><U+5834>}}) is a military cemetery located in [[Chai Wan]], [[Hong Kong]]. The cemetery interred the war dead of the Second World War, mostly soldiers from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], and [[Allied Forces]] during the [[Battle of Hong Kong]].

==Background==
On [[8 December]] [[1942]] -- less than eight hours after the [[attack on Pearl Harbour]] -- Japanese forces launched an invasion into Hong Kong territory, then a British [[Crown colony]]. The invasion started a lesser-known chapter of World War II when Commonwealth forces -- mainly British and Canadian -- struggled to defend the territory albeit outnumbered two-to-one and lacked any recent combat experience.

The Japanese forces easily crossed [[Sham Chun River]], and entered into the territory through the [[Mainland China|Mainland]] in the north. They successively forded two lines of defense and eventually crossed [[Victoria Harbour]]. Intense battles were fought on Hong Kong Island until the British surrendered the territory at the end of the month on [[Christmas Day]]. The surrender started the [[Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong|Japanese occupation]] of the territory for the next three years until Japan surrendered at the conclusion of the War.  

Casualties were heavy among defending forces. Many [[prisoners of war]] had surcome to torture, maltreatment, or were executed. Some POWs were sent to Japan where some of those did not survived. 

The Allied dead from the campaign, including British, Canadian and Indian soldiers were eventually interred at the Sai Wan Military Cemetery. A total of 1,528 soldiers, mainly Commonwealth, are buried there. There are also graves of other Allied combatants who died in Hong Kong during the war, including some Dutch sailors.

==Location==
[[Image:Sai Wan War Cemetary 1.jpg|left|250px|thumb|General view of the cemetery in 2005.]]
The cemetery is located on the northeastern corner of [[Hong Kong Island]]. The site of the cemetery is situated midway up on the north side of Mount Collinson on Cape Collinson Road. The site gradually slopes down towards the sea which used to provide a magnificent view of the harbour narrow at [[Lei Yue Mun]]. Incidentally Lei Yue Mun was where the Japanese had crossed the harbour on the evening of [[18 December]] and landed on Hong Kong Island. That same night 20 gunners at the Sai Wan Battery were massacred.

Today, the view of the harbour is obstructed by residential high rises in Chai Wan, and only on a clear day [[Kowloon]] would be visible across the harbour. The area also has a few other cemeteries. The Holy Cross Roman Catholic Cemetery; Hong Kong Military Cemetery; and the Cape Collinsion Muslim and Buddhist Cemeteries are within walking distance from one another. Further east just a few hundred meters away on the side of Pottinger Peak is the larger Cape Collinson Chinese Permanent Cemetery.

==The cemetery==
The cemetery was built in 1946 and it is now one of the many maintained by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]. A memorial hall marks the entrance into the cemetery, which bears the names of more than 2,000 Commonwealth servicemen who died in the Battle of Hong Kong or subsequently in captivity and who have no known grave. Additional panels form the cremation memorial bearing the names of 144 casualties whose remains were cremated in accordance with their faith. Also, the Sai Wan (China) Memorial commemorating 72 casualties of both World Wars whose graves in [[mainland China]] could not be maintained can found at the memorial hall. A plaque displaying the battle and army advances gives visitors the insight into the extent of the campaign.

The graves are marked with white upright granite headstones depicting the regiment's insignia. The cemetery is enclosed within a wall of flowering shrubs and bushes. A 'Stone of Remembrance', bearing the words from ''[[Ecclesiasticus]]'': "Their name liveth for evermore" marks the top of the flight of stone steps leading down a center aisle towards the Cross of Sacrifice. Both the cemetery and memorial were designed by Colin St. Clair Oakes.

Other than those died in defense of Hong Kong, the remains of POWs died in Taiwan were brought to Sai Wan for burial as well. There are now 1,528 casualties of World War II buried or commemorated at Sai Wan War Cemetery, 444 of the burials are unidentified. In addition, there are special memorials to 16 World War II casualties buried in Kowloon whose graves were lost. There are also 77 war graves of other nationalities from this period, the majority of them Dutch. The cemetery also contains special memorials to 12 World War I casualties buried in Kowloon whose graves have since been lost.

==Notable graves==
About 280 servicemen were from [[Canada]], including Brigadier [[J.K. Lawson]], and [[Colonel]] [[P. Hessessy]]. Lawson was the highest rank to be killed in action during the defence of Hong Kong, his remains were originally buried by the Japanese upon the occupation but was re-buried at the cemetery.

Company [[Sergeant]]-[[Major]] [[John Robert Osborn]], the only [[Victoria Cross]] awarded for the defence, has no grave at this cemetery, but his name is engraved on the memorial hall. His statue, however, can be found in [[Hong Kong Park]].

==Other commemorations==
Beside Osborn's statue in Hong Kong Park, other memorials to World War II exist in Hong Kong. The [[Stanley Military Cemetery]] in one of the southen tips of [[Hong Kong Island]] interred many of the prisoners of war. The [[cenotaph]] in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] commemorates both World War I and World War II.
