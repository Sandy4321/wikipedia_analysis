The '''Toutorsky Mansion''' is a five-story, 18-room house located at 1720 [[16th Street Northwest (Washington, D.C.)|16th Street]], [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|NW]] in the [[Dupont Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]] 

The {{convert|12000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} mansion was completed in 1894 for [[U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[Henry Billings Brown]], who paid $25,000 in 1891 to buy the land from the [[George Washington Riggs|Riggs]] family<ref name="storied">{{cite news | last = Hales | first = Linda | coauthors = | title = The Many-Storied Toutorsky Mansion; Historic 16th-Street Music School Opens for a 'Bare Bones' Preview| work = | pages = T9| language = | publisher = Washington Post| date = 1992-08-13| url = | accessdate = }}</ref> and spent $40,000 on its construction.<ref name="toutorsky">{{cite web| url=http://www.toutorsky.com/ | title=Toutorsky Mansion: History | accessdate=2008-09-27 }}</ref>

The house was designed by architect [[William Henry Miller (architect)|William Henry Miller]], the first graduate of [[Cornell University]]'s School of Architecture, who modeled the exterior on 16th-century [[Flanders|Flemish]] buildings, and the interior using a mixture of [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]], [[Elizabethan architecture|Elizabethan]], [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]], and [[American colonial architecture|Colonial]] elements.<ref name="toutorsky"/> The house contains eight fireplaces and a main staircase featuring hand-carved [[griffins]].<ref name="irks">{{cite news | last = Woodlee| first =Yolanda | coauthors = | title = Bed-and-Breakfast Plan Irks Dupont Neighbors; Opponents Cite Potential Traffic, Noise| work = | pages = T03| language = | publisher = Washington Post| date = 2002-06-27| url = | accessdate = }}</ref> "With its stepped and scroll-edged gables, insistent rows of windows, dark red brick, and strong horizontal stone courses, it is a rare iteration of Renaissance Flemish architecture in a city whose architectural ancestry is overwhelmingly English and French," according to the [[American Institute of Architects|AIA]] Guide to the Architecture of Washington, D.C.<ref name="aia">{{cite book| author=Moeller, Gerard Martin | title=AIA Guide to the Architecture of Washington, D.C., 4th edition| location=Baltimore, Maryland| publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press| year=2006|pages=261 | url= http://books.google.com/books/jhu?id=HwxObsj2GOQC&pg=PA261&dq=toutorsky&ei=HRHtSMC3L4TkygS44szNBg&sig=ACfU3U1X993swKk4cpghoVxHv5sUMb7HMw| isbn=0801884683}}</ref>

==History==
The mansion "provided shelter for some of the most profound deliberations and negotiations in the nation's history"; while living at the house, Justice Brown wrote the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]]-justifying [[Plessy v. Ferguson]] decision and voted to uphold the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]], the nation's first law banning a class of immigrants by race or nationality.<ref name="washbiz">

The house had several owners over the next several decades. From 1924 to 1927, the mansion was rented to the [[Iran|Persian]] [[Legation]] to the United States.<ref name="manse">{{cite news | last = Conroy| first =Asrah Booth | coauthors = | title =

In 1942, the house was purchased by the [[Zionist Organization of America]], which pushed the U.S. government, Congress, and the American public to create [[Israel]] in 1948. The group, which used the building as its headquarters through 1947, moved some interior walls to create better office spaces.<ref name="thomason"/>

===Toutorsky purchase===
The house was purchased in 1947 by Basil Peter Toutorsky. Born in 1896 in [[Novocherkassk]], [[Russia]], Toutorsky was a hereditary nobleman who had studied law at the nobles-only [[Imperial University of Moscow]] and music at the [[Moscow Conservatory of Music]]. He served in the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] during [[World War I]], surviving the explosion of the Russian battleship [[Russian battleship Imperatritsa Mariya|''Empress Maria'']] in the Black Sea in 1916; then fought for the [[White movement|White Russian]]s who tried to overthrow the [[October Revolution]].<ref name="post"/> In 1920, he fled from the [[Crimea]] to Turkey and arrived in the United States in 1923.<ref name="obit">{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = David van Tijn, Vice President Of TvT Consulting Firm, Dies| work = | pages = | language = | publisher = Washington Post | date = 1989-08-17| url = | accessdate = }}</ref> With his wife of 11 years, the Mexican opera singer Maria Ignacia Howard Toutorsky, he opened the Toutorsky Academy of Music and ran it for nearly four decades.

Among the furnishings were collections of dolls; swans; World War I medals, decorations and uniforms; stuffed wild animals; Persian carpets and tapestries; heavy antique furniture; and 21 pianos,<ref name="showhouse"/> including a [[C. Bechstein Pianofortefabrik|Bechstein]] [[grand piano|concert grand]] on which [[Franz Liszt]] had played.<ref name="storied"/> 

In November 1988, the Toutorskys bequeathed the house to [[Johns Hopkins University]]'s [[Peabody Conservatory of Music]] in exchange for an annuity and lifetime use of the mansion's carriage house.<ref name="post"/>

===Post-Toutorskys===
After Maria's death in 1988 and Basil's in 1989, the university rented some rooms to students for $1 a month to keep the house occupied.<ref name="thomason"/> University officials sought $1.5 million for the house,<ref name="manse"/> but ultimately sold it December 1990 for $808,000<ref name="thomason">{{cite news | last = Thomason| first = Robert | coauthors = | title = Toutorsky Mansion To Be Restored| work = | pages =T5 | language = | publisher = Washington Post | date = 1991-01-17| url = | accessdate = }}</ref> and used the proceeds to endow a piano studio and a scholarship fund named for Toutorsky.<ref name="toutorsky"/>

The buyer was Bruce Johnson, who owned a [[Dupont Circle]] firm that performed historic renovations. He pronounced it fundamentally sound, and planned some painting, patching and plastering.<ref name="thomason"/> Ultimately, he added air-conditioning and bathrooms.<ref name="storied"/> The building received much restoration and cosmetic work in preparation for a 1992 fundraising event called "[[National Symphony Orchestra (United States)|National Symphony Orchestra]] Decorators' Show House."<ref name="showhouse">{{cite news | last = Hales | first = Linda | coauthors = | title = Show House;

These included "Broadway Cares" benefits for AIDS/HIV research and treatment that featured live performances by cast members of "Angels in America" and other shows visiting the [[Kennedy Center]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Johnson and his partner Keith Kreger also rented out rooms in the house to members of the DC LGBT community, celebrated authors, political biographers, writers for national publications, political organizers, and others.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In 2001, realtor Humberto Gonzalez bought the property for $2.2 million. He sought to run it as a 16-room [[Bed and breakfast|bed-and-breakfast inn]] and event venue, but nearby residents objected, and the city ultimately granted him a license to offer just six rooms for rent. In 2008, Gonzalez began seeking to sell the mansion.<ref name="washbiz"/>
