The '''Krulak Mendenhall mission''' was a fact finding expedition despatched by the [[Kennedy administration]] to [[South Vietnam]] in early September 1963. The stated purpose of the expedition was to investigate the progress of the war by South Vietnam and the American military advisers against the [[Vietcong]] insurgency. The mission was led by [[US Marines|Marine]] Major General [[Victor Krulak]] and [[Joseph Mendenhall]], a senior Foreign Service Officer with Vietnam experience. The four day whirlwind trip was dispatched on the same day of a [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] meeting on September 6 and came in the wake of increasingly strained relations between the [[United States]] and [[South Vietnam]]. Civil unrest gripped that nation as [[Buddhist crisis|Buddhist demonstrations]] against the religious discrimination of President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] escalated. Following the [[Xa Loi Pagoda raids|raids on Buddhist pagodas]] on August 21 which left an estimated triple figure death toll, the US had authorised investigations into a possible [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|coup]] in a [[Cable 243|cable]] to US Ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] as South Vietnam descended into chaos. The report of the conclusion was that Krulak presented an extremely optimistic report on the progress of the war, while Mendenhall presented an extremely bleak picture of military failure and public discontent. The divergent reports led US President [[John F. Kennedy]] to famously ask his two advisers whether they had visited the same country.

==Background ==

== Initiation ==

At the end of the September 6 NSC meeting, it was agreed that the first priority was to obtain more information on the ground situation in Vietnam. [[US Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] proposed sending General Krulak on an immediate fact-finding trip. The NSC agreed that Mendenhall, would accompany him, and that on the return trip to Washington they would bring back [[John Mecklin]], the [[United States Information Service]] director, and [[Rufus Phillips]], the director of rural programs for [[United States Operation Mission]] and American adviser for the [[Strategic Hamlet Program]] to report. Krulak and Mendenhall left later that day. The State Department sent the Saigon embassy a detailed cable containing questions about Vietnamese attitudes at all levels of society. In Krulak's words, "the effect of recent events upon the attitudes of the Vietnamese in general, and upon the war effort against the Viet Cong."<ref name="pp"/>

== Expedition to Vietnam ==

In a fast paced four-day trip, the two men travelled throughout Vietnam and returned to Washington to report. Krulak went to ten different locations in all four Corps zones of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] and spoke with Lodge, the head of US forces in Vietnam General [[Paul Harkins]] and his staff, 87 US advisors, and 22 ARVN. Mendenhall went to [[Saigon]], [[Hue]], [[Da Nang]], and several other provincial cities, talking primarily to old Vietnamese friends. Their estimates of the situation were almost completely opposite.<ref name="pp"/> Mecklin wrote afterwards:"It was a remarkable assignment, to travel twenty-four thousand miles and assess a situation as complex as Vietnam and return in just four days. It was a symptom of the state the US Government was in." The mission was also marked by tension between its two leaders. Mendenhall and Krulak disliked one another intensely and spoke to each other only when necessary. Mecklin and Krulak became embroiled in a dispute on the journey to Washington. Krulak disapporaved of Mecklin's decision to bring back television footage that the Diem regime had censored, believing it to be a violation of sovereignty. After a bitter and lengthy argument on the aircraft, Krulak ordered Mecklin to leave the film in[[Alaska]] during a refuelling stop at [[Elmendorf Air Base]] and further suggested that Mecklin remain with the film in Alaska.<ref>Jones, p. 356&ndash;357.</ref>

== Report and debriefing ==

The NSC convened in the morning on September 10, immediately after the return of the delegation, to hear their reports. Mendenhall had previously worked in Vietnam under the previous US ambassador [[Elbridge Durbrow]] who had long urged political reform on the part of Diem. Krulak was a short and fiery marine who was known for his belief in military action, having earned the nickname ''brute'' in his wrestling career while in the military academy at [[Annapolis]]. [[Ross Gilpatric]], the Deputy Secretary of Defense under McNamara, noted that Mendenhall was regarded "with great suspicion on the Virginia side of the [[Potomac River|river]] [the Pentagon, headquarters of the Defense Department]" whereas Krulak was "universally liked and trusted in the Pentagon, both on the civilian and military side."<ref>Jones, p. 357.</ref> 

Their backgrounds were reflected in their divergent and diametrically opposite analyses of the war. Krulak gave a very optimistic analysis the military progress of the war and discounted the effect of the Buddhist crisis the Vietnamese army. His general conclusion was that
{{cquote|The shooting war is still going ahead at an impressive pace. It has been affected adversely by the political crisis, but the impact is not great.<ref name="pp"/>}}


Krulak asserted that a substantial amount of fighting was still required, particularly in the [[Mekong Delta]] where the Vietcong was regarded to be at its strongest. Krulak asserted at the ARVN officer corps at all levels were very conscious of the Buddhist issue, but believed that most viewed it in a detached manner and had allowed religious differences to significantly affect their internal military relationship. He believed that Vietnamese military commanders, at the various echelons, were obedient and could be expected to execute any order they view as lawful. Krulak went on to assert that bilateral military ties had not been damaged by the political crisis in any notable manner. Moving along to the Vietnamese view of the political leadership, Krulak predicted that ther was dissatisfaction among the officer, directed mainly at [[Ngo Dinh Nhu]], the younger borther of Diem who was widely seen as the power behind the regime. Krulak believed that most of the officers wanted him gone, but few were willing to remove him in a coup. Krulak noted that that three ARVN advisers strongly criticised Nhus and advocated their departure from the country to avoid a public relations disaster at the [[United Nations]]. Krulak felt that these warning signs were outweighed by what he believed was a successful military effort. Krulak felt that the war would be won irrespective of the political leadership.<ref>Jones, p. 357.</ref> He predicted that the army had little power to influence any improvement in governance and thought that they would not use what they had. Krulak optimistically concluded: 
{{cquote|Excluding the very serious political and military factors external to Vietnam, the Viet Cong war will be won if the current U.S. military and sociological programs are pursued, irrespective of the grave defects in the ruling regime.<ref name="pp"/>}}

Mendenhall strongly disputed the assessments made by Krulak. He argued that the discontent with Diem's regime had reached the point where a collapse of civil government was threatened. He reported a "reign of terror" in Saigon, Hue and Da Nang. Mendenhall reported that the populace hated the Nhus but had begun to turn against the generally respected Diem. Mendenhall asserted that many Vietnamese had come to believe that life under the Diem regime was such that they may as well submit to Vietcong control.<ref>Jones, p. 357.</ref> Mendenhall thought that the possibility of a civil war on religious grounds could be possible. Mendenhall predicted that the war could only be won with a regime change, and that without, South Vietnam would collapse under a massive communist offensive or sectarian infighting.<ref>Jones, p. 357.</ref> The diametrically opposite nature of the two reports prompted Kennedy's famous query, "You two did visit the same country, didn't you?"<ref name="pp"/>

=== Debate ===

Krulak attempted to account for the contrasting assessments by pointing out that Mendenhall had focused on surveying urban areas while he had ventured into the rural areas "where the war is." Krulak asserted that whatever political issues were gripping Saigon, they did not interfere with military progress, stating "We can stagger through to win the war with Nhu remaining in control." Hilsman asserted that "it was the difference between a military and a political view."<ref>Jones, p. 357.</ref> During the debate over the differences in outlook, Mendenhall asserted that the Saigon government had suffered "a virtually complete breakdown" following the [[Xa Loi Pagoda raids|pagoda raids]]. Mendenhall reported that Vietnamese officials feared being seen with Americans and that on one visit, Mendenhall had to remain quiet while his Vietnamese host crept around the office, searching for hidden microphones before speaking. Mendenhall asserted that "Saigon was heavy with an atmosphere of fear and hate" and that the people feared the government more than the Vietcong. He went on to state that many public servants no longer slep t at home due to the fear of being arrested by Nhu's secret police at night. Many officials had spent the bulk of their day in recent times negotiationg the release of their children who had been incarcerated for protesting against oppression of Buddhism and. Mendenhall asserted that this had relgated the war against communist insurgents from the top priority.<ref name="j358"/> 

Mendenhall went on to report that the Saigon regime's display of reconciliation and goodwill gestures towards the Buddhists were a public relations stunt. He reported that monks from provincial areas who had been arrested for demonstrating in Saigon were not returned to their original homes as promised. Mendenhall noted that when they were released, regime officials retained their idenitifcation papers, resulting in the re-arrest of the monks when they attempted to leave Saigon. They were then branded as Vietcong because they did not have government papers. As news of such tactics spread across Saigon, some monks sought refuge in the city in the homes of ARVN officers. Mendenhall reported that a growing number of people were beginning to see the Vietcong as a viable alternative to Diem. Mendenhall insisted htat the United State bore the chief responsibility for this state of affaires as it had helped the Ngo family to gain power and armed and funded it. He asserted that as Diem now used the arms against his own people, Washington also shared responsilbity. He stated that "a refusal to act would be just as much interference in Vietnam's affairs as acting."<ref name="j358">Jones, p. 358.</ref>

According to the [[Pentagon Papers]], "the critical failure of both reports was to understand the fundamental political role that the army was coming to play in Vietnam". The Papers concluded that the ARVN was the only potential force with enough power to pose an alternative to Diem. Diem and Nhu fully realized this fact, and had dealt with this with the [[divide and conquer]] paradigm. They usurped the prerogative of senior officer promotion, and promoted on loyalty to the palace, giving orders directly to generals. This sowed deep seeds of distrust among the senior officers and fragmented their potential power. Krulak failed to see that once the domestic political situation deteriorated to the point where large scale disaffection with the regime posed the possibility of a communist victory, the generals interfere in politics out of common necessity. Neither Krulak nor Mendenhall seemed to anticipate in the scenario of a military junta, the divisive effect of Diem's promotion politic would manifest itself in an internal army power struggle. Neither of the pair put any emphasis on the detrimental effects that political infighting among the generals would have had.<ref name="pp"/>

During the NSC meeting, Lodge's predecessor as US ambassador [[Frederick Nolting]] and Diem apologist took issue with Mendenhall's analysis. He pointed out that Mendenhall had been pessimistic about the situation in Vietnam for several years. Mecklin, the USIS director, reinforced and pushed Mendenhall's view further, calling on the administration to apply direct pressure by suspending nonmilitary aid, to bring about a regime change. In Mecklin's words:

{{cquote|This would unavoidably be dangerous. There was no way to be sure how events would develop. It was possible, for example, that the Vietnamese forces might fragment into warring factions, or that the new government would be so incompetent and/or unstable that the effort against the Viet Cong would collapse. The US should therefore resolve now to introduce American combat forces if necessary to present a Communist triumph midst the debris of the Diem regime.<ref name="pp"/>}}

Mecklin understood the potential for instability inherent in any military juntae that Krulak and Mendenhall had overlooked. Nevertheless, Mecklin concluded that the US should proceed in fostering a regime change, accept the consequences thereof, and contemp late the introduction of US combat troops to stop a possible  Vietcong victory.<ref name="pp"/>


The NSC meeting went on to hear Phillips' bleak report on the situation in the Mekong Delta, and his doubts about the validity of Krulak's optimistic outlook on the military prospects. Phillips argued that the struggle was mainly a political contest for popular allegiance, not a military battle, and that Diem  was failing in this regard. He claimed that the [[Strategic Hamlet Program]] was a shambles in the villages, particularly in the Delta. The meeting ended on this note and no decisions were made as a consequence of the presentations.<ref name="pp"/> When it was noted that Phillips had recently been on the battle scene in the [[Mekong Delta]], Keenedy asked for his assessment of the situation. Phillips replied:"Well, I don't like to contradict Gneral Krulak, but I have to tell you, Mr. President, that we're not winning the war, particularly in the Delta. The troops are paralysed, they're in the barracks, and this is what is actually going on in one province that's right next to Saigon." Phillips asserted that only the removal of Nhu could possibly boost the situation. Phillips asserted that the only way this could be effected was to bring in Colonel [[Edward Lansdale]], the CIA operative who had facilitated Diem's rise to power a decade earlier. Kennedy dismissed that proposal. Phillips recommended three measures

#Terminate aid to the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces|ARVN Special Forces]] of Colonel [[Le Quang Tung]], who took his orders directly from Nhu and not the Army Command. Tung had led the [[Xa Loi Pagoda raids|raids on Buddhist pagodas]] on August 21 which had killed hundreds and saw widespread physical destruction.
#Cut funds to the Motion Picture Center for producing hagiographic films about the Nhus
#Pursue covert actions aimed at diving and discrediting Tung and Major General [[Ton That Dinh]], the military governor of Saigon and the Commander of the ARVN III Corps. Dinh was the youngest general in the histroy of the ARVN, primarily due to his loyalty to the Ngo family.<ref>Jones, pp. 358&ndash;359.</ref>

When Kennedy asked Phillips what would happen if Nhu diverted money away from the war to prop up his personal schemes and then blame the United States for any military deterioration which resulted, Phillips replied that the ARVN would revolt. Phillips argued that the presence of ARVN officers on Vietcong hit lists would not allow Nhu to drop the fight against the communists. Phillips said that if Nhu refused to distribute the money to the troops in the province, the Americans could transport the money directly into the countryside in suitcases.<ref>Jones, p. 359.</ref>

=== Robust disagreement ===

The atmosphere of the meeting became confrontational when Krulak interrupted Phillips to assert that American military adviser in south Vietnam rejected the USOM officer's assessments. Phillips conceded that although the overall fighting level had improved, this was not the case in the crucial delta areas where "the strategic hamlets are being chewed to pieces by the Vietcong." Phillips noted that the provincial military adviser in [[Long An Province]] adjacent to Saigon had reported that the Vietcong had overrun 200 Strategic Hamlets in the previous week, forcing the villages to destroy their houses and remove the barbed wire fencing. McNamara shook his head at the radically divergent reports. When Krulak derided Phillips, Assistant Secretary of State [[Averell Harriman]] could no longer restrain himself shouted "You're a damn fool" to the general. Phillips diplomatically took over from Harriman and asserted that it was a battle for hearts and minds rather than pure military metrics.<ref>Jones, p. 359.</ref> 

Mecklin generated more disquiet during the meeting by advocating the use of American combat troops to unseat the Diem regime and win the war. He asserted that "the time had come for th US to apply direct pressure to bring about a change of government, however distasteful." Mecklin asserted that there would be a backlash if aid was simply cut, so US troops would have to directly fix the problem. Mecklin later wrote to USIS head Edward R. Murrow to inist that US troops would welcome combat in the case of a communist escalation. On the journey back to the United States, he had  asserted that the use of American combat forces would encourage and coup and lift morale against the Vietcong. He also called for the engineering of a coup. He called for the US to show more intent.<ref>Jones, p, 360.</ref> 

The pessimism expressed by Phillips and Mecklin surprised [[Frederick Nolting]], Lodge's predecessor as US ambassador in Saigon. Nolting said that Phillips' account "surprised the hell out of me. I couldn't believe my ears." Nolting asserted that Mecklin was psychologically vulnerable after his wife had left him and had been brainwashed by his roommates. At the time, Mecklin was living with journalists [[David Halberstam]] and [[Neil Sheehan]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' and [[UPI]] respectively. Halberstam and Sheehan both won [[Pulitzer Prize]]s and were strident critics of Diem.<ref>Jones, p. 360.</ref>


== Aftermath ==

One strategy which was being given increasing consideration in these meetings, as well as at the US embassy in Saigon and in Congress, was a suspension of non-military aid to Diem. After the erroneous [[Voice of America]] broadcast of aid suspension on August 26, Lodge had been authorized on August 29 to suspend aid at his discretion if it would facilitate the [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|coup]]. In the meantime, the US Senate began to put pressure on the Administration to act against Diem. Assistant Secretary of State [[Roger Hilsman]] was lobbied by the Senate Subcommittee on the Far East. Senator [[Frank Church]] informed the administration that he intended to introduce a resolution condemning Diem's anti-Buddhist repression and calling for the termination of aid to South Vietnam unless the religious equality was insituted. Church agreed to temporarily delay the introduction of the bill to avoid embarrassing the administration.<ref name="pp"/>

The proposed usage a selective aid suspension to push Diem into end religious discrimination was actively discussed at the State Department during the Krulak Mendenhall mission, Mecklin later specifically suggested it to the NSC. On September 8, AID Director David Bell warned in a television interview that Congress might cut aid to the Diem regime if it did not change its policies. On September 9, Kennedy backed away from Bell's comments, stating "I don't think we think that [a reduction in aid to Saigon] would be helpful at this time." On September 11, the day after Kennedy received the Krulak Mendenhall reports, Lodge reversed his position in a long cable, proposing detailed consideration be given to methods in which non-military aid suspension might be utilised as a sanction to topple Diem. Lodge concluded that the US could not get satisfaction from Diem, and had force events to come to a head. After a further White house meeting on September 11, Senator Church was informed that his bill was acceptable and he introduced the legislation into the Senate.<ref name="pp"/> 

The National Security Council convened again on Spetember 17 to consider two alternative proposals for dealing with Diem prepared by Hilsman. The first one favoured by Hilsman and others at the State Department was the "pressures and persuasion track" and involved a escalating series of measures at both public and private level including selective aid suspension and pressuring Diem to remove Nhu from power. The alternative was "reconciliation with arehabilitated GVN track" which involved a public appearance of acquiescence of recent GVN actions and a decision to salvage as much as possible from the situation. Both proposals assumed that a coup was out of the question.<ref name="pp"/>
