The {{nihongo|'''''Metroid'''''|<U+30E1><U+30C8><U+30ED><U+30A4><U+30C9>|''Metoroido''}} is a series of [[science fiction]] [[adventure game|adventure]] [[video game]]s produced by [[Nintendo]]. The series was conceived by longtime Nintendo designer [[Gunpei Yokoi]].<ref name="history"/> Metroid combined the platforming of ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' and the exploration aspect of ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' with a decidedly darker atmosphere. The series features one of the first female [[protagonist]]s in a video game. The series is also noted for [[linearity (computer and video games)|nonlinear gameplay]]. ''Metroid'' chronicles the missions of [[bounty hunter]] [[Samus Aran]] to protect the galaxy from the depradations of the Space Pirates and their attempts to harness the power of fictional organisms such as the Metroid against civilization.

The ''Metroid'' series currently consists of ten games across different video game platforms. All of the games in the series have been both critically acclaimed and commercially successful, though each installment has seen varying levels of success. It is also one of Nintendo's best selling franchises with 13 million games sold.<ref name="history">{{cite web|author=Rus McLaughlin|url=http://games.ign.com/articles/815/815011p1.html|title=IGN Presents The History of Metroid|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2007-08-24]]|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref> Samus Aran has also been featured in many other Nintendo produced games.

==Overview==
===Common gameplay elements===
The ''Metroid'' series games contain elements from shooter, platforming, and adventure games.<ref name="history"/> The games are notable for their non-linear progression and solitary exploration format where the player only controls [[Samus Aran]], with few or no other characters to interact with. The series has been a 2D side scroller in all its incarnations until the Metroid Prime series changed the format to a [[first person (video games)|first-person perspective]], leading to a strong [[first-person shooter]] element while still retaining its adventure and exploration features. The player gains items and [[power-up]]s for Samus' cybernetic suit by defeating alien creatures through real-time combat with her arm cannon, which enables further exploration.<ref name="history"/><ref name="pro">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/gamepro/domestic/games/features/71888.shtml|author=July 11th, 2006|author=GamePro Staff|title=Feature: The 10-Best Video-Game Franchises|publisher=GamePro|accessdate=2008-02-26}}</ref> Frequently recurring upgrades include the ''Morph ball'', where Samus curls into a tight ball and can roll into tight places and plant bombs.<ref name="history"/> ''[[Metroid Prime 3: Corruption]]'' is the first game in the ''Metroid'' series to use extensive voice acting; however, Samus remains a [[silent protagonist]].<ref name="history"/> There is very little story explanation in the first few Metroid games, though more backstory was introduced in [[Super Metroid]] with its opening narration, and the Prime series with the scanning visor that allows the player to read information off of walls and computer terminals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/557/557284p1.html|author=IGN Staff|year=October 14th, 2004|title=A Space Bounty Hunter's Arsenal|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-02-26}}</ref>

The ''Metroid'' games have been a popular for [[Speedrun#Metroid series|speedrunning]], which is the act of completing a game in the fastest time possible. Speedrunning is encouraged by the game design as the completion time has often determined what ending a player gets to see, with a shorter time being better.<ref name="history"/> ''Super Metroid'' is thought to have helped popularize speedrunning in video games through the non-linear design that allowed for sequence breaking through secret passages and other means.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/813/813952p1.html|author=Lucas M. Thomas|year=August 20th, 2007|title=Super Metroid Review|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-02-26}}</ref> Also, the original Metroid introduced the challenge of having 3 minutes to escape from either a planet or a ship that is set to self destruct, which is another gameplay innovation of the Metroid series.<ref name="history"/>

The games are influenced by the two other major [[Nintendo]] franchises, [[Super Mario Bros.]] and [[The Legend of Zelda]].<ref name="history"/> From Mario, the game had extensive areas of platform jumping, and from Zelda, non-linear exploration, but Metroid decidedly differs from those games in its atmosphere of solitude and foreboding.<ref name="history"/> Further, Metroid had five different endings based on how quickly a player could complete the game, a design unheard of at the time.<ref name="history"/>

===Recurring characters===
{{seealso|Samus Aran}}
The heroine, ''Samus Aran'', is a proficient galactic [[bounty hunter]].  She wears an extremely powerful and adaptable exoskeleton suit made by the ancient [[Metroid (series)#Chozo|Chozo]] who specifically designed it for her.<ref name ="samus"/>

The antagonists of the ''Metroid'' series, the ''Space Pirates'' are a hostile group of "interstellar nomads" resembling humanoid [[insects]], who plunder colonies and ships. A single Pirate may have many biological differences between individuals of their own species, most likely because of their willingness to perform self-experimentation and mutation. Important leaders include Ridley, the Space Pirate commander, Mother Brain, the biomechanical defense of Zebes controlled by the Space Pirates, and Kraid, a recurring boss. The organization also includes a winged, ''[[mantis]]''-like species, the Ki Hunters. The Space Pirates are interested in Metroid research, especially in using Metroids for energy generation, as soldiers, and for experimentation&nbsp;<U+2014> their Phazon experiments produced all the Metroid variants seen in the ''Prime'' games with the exception of Prime itself.

''Mother Brain'' is a recurring game boss in the series.

The ''Galactic Federation'' is as its name suggests, the governing body of the galaxy. The GF was formed after numerous space-faring species made contact, and the subsequent cultural convergence led to rapid technological advancements.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.mechadrake.com/metroidmanga.html|title=Metroid eManga pgs. 9-11|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref> They often contract Samus with large missions to complete, and aim to eradicate the Space Pirates.
Samus trained in the Federation's military before becoming a bounty hunter. It is assumed that she left following the death of her commanding officer, ''Adam Malkovich''. Samus has a profound respect for Adam because he died in order to save Samus in a previous mission.<ref name="FusionAdamDiscussion">'''Computer:''' Did this "Adam" care for you?  Would he sit in a safe Command Room and order you to die? / '''Samus:''' He would understand that some must live and some must die...  He knew what it meant.  He made that sacrifice once. / '''Computer:''' So he chose life for you?  Our fair warrior, Samus Aran...  Your Adam gave his life so that you might keep yours...  For the sake of the universe... {{cite video game|title=[[Metroid Fusion]]|developer=[[Nintendo R&D1]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=2002-11-15|platform=[[Game Boy Advance]]|language=English}}</ref> The Galactic Federation's soldiers use [[Powered exoskeleton|powered armor]] similar to Samus's; however, they are much weaker. Their technology usually bears multiple versions of their symbol, a stylized cross-shape that seems based on their visors. Troopers are also given a basic repeating assault weapon, and in ''Metroid Prime 3: Corruption'', some are equipped with the Phazon Enhancement Device.

A species of bird-like bipeds, the ''Chozo'' raised Samus Aran and outfitted her with armaments.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.mechadrake.com/metroidmanga.html|title=Metroid eManga Vol. 2 pgs. 2-70|accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref> They are portrayed as mysterious and sage-like throughout the Metroid series. The origins and age of the Chozo race and civilization are unknown, but they were once spread across several planets in the Metroid universe, though none have been seen alive in the current time of the games. The Chozo were extremely technologically advanced, but took pride in their elaborate statuary. They also exchanged knowledge with other species, including the Luminoth of Aether, the Reptilici of Bryyo, the Elysians of Elysia ([[robots]] which they themselves built), and several other as yet unseen species.<ref name="AgeofScienceScan">The ships of Bryyo sped to the stars, in all directions, bearing the banner of peace.  Soon we found stellar brethren in the ''Chozo'', the '''Luminoth''', and the Vlla.  Starborne knowledge came to Bryyo, and we gladly sent our wisdom to our new friends in return.{{cite video game|title=[[Metroid Prime 3: Corruption]]|developer=[[Retro Studios]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=2007-8-27|platform=[[Wii]]|language=English}}</ref> In the Japanese versions of the games, the Chozo are only ever identified by the generic term {{nihongo|ch<U+014D>jin-zoku|<U+9CE5><U+4EBA><U+65CF>|lit. "race of bird-humans"}}, of which the name "Chozo" is an anglicized version.  In ''Super Metroid'', some of the Chozo statues would rise up and attack Samus; these bosses are called ''Torizos''.  In ''Metroid Prime'', in some areas later on in game play, ''Chozo'' ghosts appear and attack Samus. Although originally allies, they have been maddened by the Phazon corruption of their planet, and can no longer distinguish friend from foe. However, they appear only at important Chozo religious sites, greatly limiting their range.

The eponymous in-game ''Metroids'' are large [[jellyfish]]-like with quadripartite [[cell nucleus|nuclei]]. They are capable of [[siphon]]ing an undetectable [[life energy]] from any animal, generally causing the death of the victim in the process.<ref name="history"/> This energy can also be siphoned from the Metroid in turn, allowing it to be used as a living power source. ''[[Metroid II: Return of Samus|Metroid II]]'' established a five-stage [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] in which those Metroids native to SR-388 go through two stages of [[ecdysis]] followed by two stages of [[mutation]], thus maturing through five previously unknown forms: ''Alpha'', ''Gamma'', ''Zeta'', ''Omega'', and ''[[Eusociality|Queen]]''. ''[[Metroid Prime]]'' introduced two new, [[Metroid (series)#Phazon|Phazon]]-mutated forms: ''Hunter Metroids'', and ''[[Nuclear fission|Fission]] Metroids'', ''[[Metroid Prime 2: Echoes]]'' has a Phazon-mutated strain of Metroid, the ''Tallon Metroid''. Instead of siphoning all of their power from victims, they can feed directly off Phazon. They are born as Infant Metroids from [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoons]] and mature into adulthood when exposed to Phazon. The game also introduces ''Dark Tallon Metroids'', Tallon Metroids corrupted by the [[Metroid Prime 2: Echoes|Ing]]. In ''[[Metroid Prime 3: Corruption]]'', three new forms of Metroid appear: ''Phazon Metroid'', which is almost exactly like a common Metroid, except that it is capable of phasing in and out of local timespace; ''Hopping Metroid'', which cannot hover, phase out of local timespace, or drain energy, but can fight using its claws as melee weapons and armor for defense; and the ''Metroid Hatcher'', a boss which can float and spawn Phazon Metroids, but cannot phase out of local timespace.

[[Image:PhazonPile.JPG|thumb|A close-up image of Phazon]]
A highly radioactive and mutagenic, cancerous element, ''Phazon'' is a major plot point of the ''Metroid Prime'' trilogy. Phazon is harvested for use in weaponry. In the third game of the Metroid Prime series, [[Dark Samus]] ambushes Samus and her fellow hunters, corrupting their bodies with phazon. Samus and the other hunters barely survive this. Because of this corruption, the cells in their bodies naturally produce phazon on their own. All of them were given PED suits (Phazon Enhancement Devices). Some federation soldiers have been given PED suits, but they have to wear backpacks filled with phazon energy to enhance their weapons. However, the corrupted hunters can extract the phazon that their cells are producing and use that. There is a danger to the corruption however. If their cells create too much phazon, then they will be "corrupted" into a dark version of their former selves, much like Dark Samus. In the case of Samus herself, the game will end with her screaming and turning into a second Dark Samus. Apparently the other hunters of ''[[Metroid Prime 3: Corruption]]'' were not able to correctly use the PED, as you must fight them all at least once. In ''[[Metroid Prime]]'', the regular blue variant is seen in the game, as well as a more potent and more dangerous orange variant, found only in the Impact Crater. This Phazon is deadly to even Samus with her Phazon Suit.

''Metroid Prime'' is a sapient Metroid, heavily mutated by Phazon, who serves as the main antagonist of the Metroid Prime trilogy.  Upon its defeat at the end of ''[[Metroid Prime]]'', it absorbed Samus's Phazon Suit and was reborn as ''Dark Samus''.  In ''Metroid Prime 2: Echoes'', Dark Samus is fought several times, and each time is stronger than before.  In ''Metroid Prime 3: Corruption'' Dark Samus is seen several times, but only fought at the very end of the game, where she has become powerful enough to create clones of herself.  Her destruction in ''Prime 3'' is seemingly final, and all Phazon is destroyed with her.

===Story===
The ten games in the ''Metroid'' series focus on the adventures of [[Samus Aran]] and her assignments to wipe out threats to the Galactic Federation presented by the Space Pirates and their attempts to harness various biological weapons such as the Metroids and the also the [[radioactive]] and [[mutagenic]] compound Phazon. The first ''Metroid'' game had Samus exploring the planet Zebes to stop the Space Pirates from exploiting the Metroid species to conquer the galaxy. She confronts the cybernetic lifeform Mother Brain, as well as its guardians, Kraid and Ridley.

;''[[Metroid]]'' and ''[[Metroid: Zero Mission]]'' (1986/2004): Samus travels through the caverns of the planet Zebes to stop the Space Pirates from exploiting the Metroid species for galactic domination. She confronts the cybernetic lifeform Mother Brain, as well as its guardians, Kraid and Ridley.<ref name="timelines"/> In the 2004 remake ''[[Metroid: Zero Mission]]'', it is [[retcon]]ned that she was ambushed by Space Pirates after defeating Mother Brain and escaped from Zebes, and her ship crash-lands back on the surface. Stripped of her Power Suit and her ship destroyed, she is forced to infiltrate the Space Pirate mothership in order to find a way off the planet with only an emergency pistol for protection. After receiving a fully powered suit from deep within the Chozo ruins, she defeats Mecha-Ridley and escapes from the mothership before it self-destructs.<ref name ="samus"/>
;''[[Metroid Prime]]'' (2002): Samus receives a distress signal in her new ship and travels to Tallon IV to stop the Space Pirates from exploiting a powerful [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] substance known as Phazon. She discovers that the Chozo once settled on this planet, and their disappearance, as well as the emergence of Phazon, is due to a meteor impacting the planet decades ago. After ruining a Space Pirate mining operation and collecting the twelve Chozo Artifacts that allow access to the sealed impact crater, she confronts, and seemingly destroys, Metroid Prime, the apparent source of the planet's Phazon corruption.
:;''[[Metroid Prime Pinball]]'' (2005): Not a separate canon game in the ''Metroid'' storyline but actually retells the story of the original ''Metroid Prime'' in pinball format.<ref>{{cite web | author=Craig Harris|url = http://ds.ign.com/articles/660/660466p1.html | title = Metroid Prime Pinball | year = October 21st, 2005 | accessdate = 2008-02-27 | publisher = [[IGN]]}}</ref>
;''[[Metroid Prime Hunters]]'' (2006): When the Federation receives an unusual telepathic message, Samus is sent to the remote Alimbic Cluster in the Tetra Galaxy to uncover the rumored "Ultimate Power."  Six rival bounty hunters that also heard the message actively attempt to secure the power before anyone else, including Samus. It transpires that the promise of ultimate power was actually a lie sent by the creature Gorea, sealed away by the Alimbics in a void between dimensions. After killing Gorea, Samus and the 6 bounty hunters all leave the cluster, empty handed, but alive.
;''[[Metroid Prime 2: Echoes]]'' (2004): Samus is sent to investigate the planet Aether after a squad of GF Marines was lost there. Samus finds them all dead, killed by several creatures, mainly consisting of an evil race called the Ing.  Upon meeting the only remaining member of Luminoth (the others were frozen in stasis chambers until the end of the game, where the last of the energy is replaced, and Dark Aether is destroyed), Samus learns Aether has been split into [[Parallel universe (fiction)|two dimensions]] by a meteor similar to the one that crashed on Tallon IV. Samus helps save Aether from the Ing, but encounters Metroid Prime once again, now called Dark Samus, a heavily mutated being who had copied Samus' genetic code and stolen her Phazon suit at the end of her Tallon IV adventure.
;''[[Metroid Prime 3: Corruption]]'' (2007): Space Pirates shut down Galactic Federation computer systems and then engage in large scale combat in an attempt to further spread Phazon. Enormous Phazon-based seedships, known as Leviathans, impact planets and begin corrupting them with Phazon. Samus is charged with destroying the 'Phazon Seeds' and restoring functionality to the Federation's computer network. After purging three planets of Phazon (including the Space Pirate homeworld), the Federation locates the source of Phazon, planet Phaaze, which is made entirely of Phazon. As the Federation engages the Space Pirates in orbit, Samus enters the depths of the planet, and succeeds at finally destroying Dark Samus and Phazon once and for all.
;''[[Metroid II: Return of Samus]]'' (1991): Following the events of the previous chapters, the Galactic Federation deems the Metroid species too dangerous to exist, and, after their own failed attempts, employs Samus to travel to the Metroid homeworld, SR388, and exterminate the entire species. After killing every Metroid, Samus finds an unhatched egg behind the Queen Metroid's chamber. Before she gets the chance to destroy it, it hatches a tiny Metroid larva which imprints Samus as its mother. Helping her escape back to her ship, it is handed over by Samus to the Galactic Federation's research station for study.<ref name="timelines"/>
;''[[Super Metroid]]'' (1994): Before the scientists could conduct extensive research, Samus received a distress signal from the research lab. She returns just in time to see Ridley stealing the hatchling, having killed all of the scientists. She then follows Ridley to the rebuilt base on Zebes to stop the Space Pirates in their new plan to clone the Metroids and use them as a weapon. She kills the reborn versions of Ridley and Kraid, as well as new guardians Phantoon and Draygon, in order to confront Mother Brain once again. Samus is nearly killed in the battle, but is saved, and her suit supercharged, by the Metroid hatchling, shortly before Mother Brain kills it.<ref name="timelines"/> Samus proceeds to destroy Mother Brain, and once again escapes Zebes during a countdown to an explosion. This time, the entire planet explodes, taking with it the few remaining cloned Metroids.
;''[[Metroid Fusion]]'' (2002): While acting as a bodyguard for researchers on the planet SR388, Samus is infected by a creature known as the [[X Parasite]], originally the [[prey]] of the Metroid species. Doctors surgically remove portions of her Power Suit and cured the X infection with a vaccine created from the [[DNA]] of the baby Metroid from her previous adventure. The vaccine not only allowed her to survive the parasite, but to absorb them to power up her energy and weapons. She is then sent to investigate a disturbance at the space research facility, Biologic Space Labs, where researchers attempted to contain the infected Power Suit. It is revealed that an X mimicking Samus, nicknamed the SA-X, has taken control of Samus's suit and released other X parasites inside the other specimens, infecting the entire station as they assimilate other organisms.<ref name="timelines"/> While trying to destroy the rapidly multiplying SA-X clones, Samus discovers a secret Federation Metroid breeding program for peaceful purposes and new plans to capture SA-X and conduct research on her. Realizing the threat this would pose, Samus's CO computer, Adam, suggests that she self-destruct the station, as well as alter its propulsion to intercept with SR388, causing the station's self-destruct vaporization field to include the planet eliminating the X and Metroid threat once and for all. Samus is confronted by one of the SA-X which she defeats but the parasite escapes. After changing the station's propulsion to intercept with SR388, Samus races back to her ship before the station crashes, only to have to battle the SA-X and a large Omega Metroid and then reach her ship before the station crashes.

==Development==
===History===
[[Image:NES Metroid.png|thumb|left|''Metroid'' provided a thoroughly nonlinear gaming experience.]]
In the mid-[[1980's]], Nintendo's [[Nintendo Research & Development 1|RD&1]] team started simultaneous development of two games for the [[Famicom Disk System]]: ''[[Kid Icarus]]'' and ''[[Metroid]]'', both released in 1986. ''Metroid'' was designed to be a shooting game that combined the platform jumping of the [[Super Mario Bros.]] with the non-linear exploration of ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' and also as intensive. Half way through development, one of the staff said "Hey, wouldn't that be kind of cool if it turned out that this person inside the suit was a woman?", and the vote carried.<ref name="history"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/488/488084p3.html|title=Metroid: Zero Mission director roundtable|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2004-01-30|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref> While ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' was never mentioned during development, the team is said to have been influenced by that film's atmosphere, and the [[Alien (film series)|films]] have since been one of their biggest inspiration origins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.n-retro.com/reportajes/origenmetroid.htm|title=El Origen de Metroid|language=Spanish|publisher=N-Retro|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref>

After ''Super Metroid'''s release, it would take eight years until the next game was released. A [[Nintendo 64]] title was considered during the period, but Nintendo "couldn't come up with any concrete ideas".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/377/377563p2.html|title=Metroid Prime Roundtable QA|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2002-11-15|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref> Then in 1999, [[Retro Studios]], a newly formed [[second-party developer]] based in Texas, was given the project for ''[[Metroid Prime]]''. It was the first time that Nintendo allowed a studio outside of [[Japan]] to work on one of their titles.<ref>{{cite web|author=IGN Staff|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/377/377001p1.html|title=Quotes from Metroid Prime Roundtable|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2002-11-11]]|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref>

Rumors abounded since 2005 about the development of a title called ''Metroid Dread''. In [[Metroid Prime 3]], there is a message on a computer panel that if scanned says "Experiment status report update: Metroid project 'Dread' is nearing the final stages of completion." Developers from [[Retro Studios]] gave a full but cryptic denial of any connection with the rumored game, and Nintendo has denied they are making another 2D Metroid title at this time.

===Creation and design===
[[Image:Metroidprime10101.jpg|thumb|''Metroid Prime'' introduced 3D to the series]]
''[[Metroid]]'', ''[[Metroid II: Return of Samus]]'', ''[[Super Metroid]]'', ''[[Metroid Fusion]]'' and ''[[Metroid: Zero Mission]]'' were all developed by Nintendo's internal [[Nintendo Research & Development 1|R&D1 section]]. The games which have been developed by separate teams are ''[[Metroid Prime|Metroid Prime 1]]'', ''[[Metroid Prime 2: Echoes|2]]'', and ''[[Metroid Prime 3: Corruption|3]]'' ([[Retro Studios]]), ''[[Metroid Prime Hunters]]'' ([[Nintendo Software Technology|Nintendo Software Technology Corporation]]), and ''[[Metroid Prime Pinball]]'' ([[Fuse Games]]).

The central figures in the production and development of the ''Metroid'' series are [[Yoshio Sakamoto]] who has directed or supervised the development of all the games (excluding ''Metroid II''), [[Gunpei Yokoi]] who headed R&D1 and produced the first three games before his death in 1997, Makoto Kanoh who directed and designed scenarios for the first three games, and [[Hiroji Kiyotake]] who designed the characters for the original game. [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], who made the ''[[Mario]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda (series)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' series, has not been involved with the production of ''Metroid'', but he did act as producer for both ''Metroid Prime'' and its sequel.

==Audio==
The ''Metroid'' series has been especially noted for its [[video game music|music]]. [[Hirokazu 'Hip' Tanaka]], composer of the original ''Metroid'', has said that he wanted to make a score that made players feel like they were encountering a "living organism", that had no distinction between music and sound effects.<ref name="original">{{cite web|author=IGN Staff|url=http://games.ign.com/articles/811/811667p1.html|title=Top Ten Tuesday: Best 8-Bit Soundtracks|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=[[2007-08-08]]|accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref> The only time the main Metroid theme was heard was once Mother Brain was defeated, giving the victorious player the [[catharsis]].

===Live-action movie===
A live-action movie version of ''Metroid'' was reportedly in development by [[Lion Rock Productions]], based around [[Samus Aran]], along with her early battles with the Metroids and the Mother Brain. It was scheduled to be released in theaters around 2006, but either has been canceled or remains in [[development hell]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news.php?id=4202|title= John Woo Bringing Metroid to the Big Screen|accessdate=2007-10-18|date=[[2004-04-07]]|publisher=Crave Online}}</ref> On [[April 1]], 2005, [[IGN]] posted an article reporting that critically panned director [[Uwe Boll]] would be directing the ''Metroid'' movie, with Samus herself being portrayed by [[Michelle Rodriguez]], despite her opinion that the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]] was a "machine for kids". The supposed movie, with a $19 million budget, wouldn't follow the games' storylines; instead, it would have Samus, a "scientist for the government," donning a Power Suit to defend Earth from alien invaders in the near future, in a plot similar to that of ''[[Half-Life]]''. At the end of the "report," however, Casamassina reveals the whole article was an [[April Fools Joke]].<ref>{{citeweb|author=Matt Casamassina|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/600/600860p1.html|title= Metroid Movie Details Announced|accessdate=2008-02-17|date=[[2005-04-01]]|publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref>
