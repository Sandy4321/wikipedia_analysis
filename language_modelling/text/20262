Romberg was removed from the office due to his support for the challenging clauses in a political unification treaty governing the allocation of tax revenues. He also angered the West German officials with his continous demands for more cash help to bail out the weak East German industries and to finance welfare payments.<ref name=chitri/> The other reason for his removal was related to the East Germany's rapidly deteriorating economic status.<ref name=lat90>{{cite news|last=Marshall|first=Tyler|title=Two ministers are fired and two resign.
