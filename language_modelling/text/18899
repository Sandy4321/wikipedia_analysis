'''State Road 836''', locally known as the '''Dolphin Expressway''', is a 13-mile-long six-lane divided [[toll road|tollway]] currently extending from [[U.S. Route 1|US 1]] ([[State Road 5 (Florida)|SR 5]]) and [[State Road A1A (Florida)|SR A1A]]) in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], westward past [[Miami International Airport]] to the Homestead Extension of [[Florida's Turnpike]] (SR 821) in [[Sweetwater, Florida|Sweetwater]], [[Florida]], [[United States|USA]].  It is maintained and operated by the [[Miami-Dade Expressway Authority]].  

The toll for eastbound automobiles is $1.25, paid at a toll booth between Northwest 22d and Northwest 17th Avenues (toll is not collected from westbound traffic).  The easternmost 1.29 miles of SR 836 (from [[Interstate 95]] to US 1) is signed [[Interstate 395 (Florida)|Interstate 395]].

Originally envisioned as the '''Twentieth Street Tollway''' in 1964 (with a spur to the airport along LeJeune Road), construction on the '''Fourteenth Street East-West Expressway''' between the [[State Road 826 (Florida)|Palmetto Expressway]] and US 1 started in 1967 and was completed in 1969. Two years later, construction of the western extension to the Turnpike commenced (and finished in 1974).  Also in 1974, the name of the tollway was changed to commemorate the success of the [[Miami Dolphins]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]], after back-to-back wins in the [[Super Bowl]].

With the failure of the [[Florida Department of Transportation]] to build either the previously-planned airport spur or the proposed LeJeune Road Expressway to give additional access to the airport, [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]]'s sole complete east-west throughway is now often congested, most commonly in the stretch between LeJeune Road ([[State Road 953 (Florida)|SR 953]]) and the Palmetto Expressway ([[State Road 826 (Florida)|SR 826]]).  Short range plans include the construction of additional lanes and a redesign of a heavily-used interchange with SR 826.  In addition, [[Miami-Dade Transit]] has begun the process of extending its [[Miami-Dade Transit#Metrorail|Metrorail]] line along the Dolphin Expressway from a newly-relocated SR 953 west to the Turnpike and south to [[Florida International University]].

Damage occurred to SR 836 during [[Hurricane Katrina]] when the high winds took down the 97th Avenue bridge which was already under construction. Nobody was injured.

==Dolphin Expressway Extension (2004)==
Construction of yet another extension of SR 836 started in 2004 [http://www.mdxway.com/improvements/docs/Transportation_Improvement.pdf].  The first segment (westward to Northwest 137th Avenue) is scheduled to be completed in 2007; the second segment (southward to Southwest 136th Street) is in the development stage.  The extension will be accessible only to motorists with [[electronic toll collection|electronic toll-paying]] capability: there will be no capacity for the collection of cash at the planned [[toll booth]].

Below are a series of photos of the under construction segment.
