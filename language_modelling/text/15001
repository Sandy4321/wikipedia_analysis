'''Somerset''' is a [[Counties of England|county]] in the south-west of [[England]].                                                         The [[county town]] is [[Taunton]]. The [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Somerset borders the counties of [[Bristol]] and [[Gloucestershire]] to the north, [[Wiltshire]] to the east, [[Dorset]] to the south-east, and [[Devon]] to the south-west. It is also partly bounded to the north and west by the coast of the [[Bristol Channel]] and the [[estuary]] of the [[River Severn]].

Somerset is a [[rural]] county of rolling hills such as the [[Mendip Hills]] and [[Exmoor National Park]], downland, and large flat expanses of land including the [[Somerset Levels]].

==Administration==
The [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Somerset consists of a [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|non-metropolitan county]] and two [[Unitary authority|unitary authorities]]. The [[Districts of England|districts]] of Somerset are [[West Somerset]], [[South Somerset]], [[Taunton Deane]], [[Mendip]] and [[Sedgemoor]]. The two administratively independent unitary authorities, which were established on [[1 April]] [[1996]] following the break up of the [[county of Avon]], are [[North Somerset]] and [[Bath and North East Somerset]]. These unitary authorities include areas that were once part of Somerset before the creation of Avon in 1974.

The [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] is considering a proposal by Somerset County Council to change Somerset's administrative structure by abolishing the five districts to create a Somerset unitary authority. The changes are planned to be implemented no later than [[1 April]] [[2009]].
<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.somerset.gov.uk/somerset/features/unitarycouncil/page8.cfm | work= Somerset County Council | title= A unitary council for Somerset | accessdate=2007-06-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1509022 | work= Communities and Local Government | title= Proposals for future unitary structures: Stakeholder consultation |accessdate=2007-06-29 }}</ref>
However, support for the county council's bid is not guaranteed and opposition among the district council and local population is strong, with 82% of people responding to a referendum organized by the five district councils rejecting the proposals.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.tauntondeane.gov.uk/tdbcsites/council/press/latestnewsitems.asp?id=222 | work= Taunton Deane Council | title= Residents reject Unitary Council bid | accessdate=2007-06-29 | date= June 2007 }}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name is pronounced as though spelled 'Summerset'. The name derives from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''Sumors<U+01E3>te'', which is short for ''Sumort<U+016B>ns<U+01E3>te'' = "the people living at or dependent upon Sumort<U+016B>n.
<ref name="watts1">{{cite book | last=Watts | first=Victor (Ed.) | title=The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | date=2004 | id=ISBN 0-521-36209-1}}</ref> 
''Sumort<U+016B>n'' is modern [[Somerton]] and means "summer settlement", a [[farmstead]] tended during the summer but not occupied in winter.<ref name="name">{{cite web | title=Mesolithic hunters and fishermen | work=Somerset History |url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/archives/ASH/Meshuntfish.htm|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> However, Somerton is not down on the moors where only summer occupation was possible because of flooding but on a hill where winter occupation would have been feasible.

The name continues in the [[motto]] of the county, 'Sumorsaete ealle', meaning 'all the people of Somerset' in [[Old English language|Old English]].

==History==
:''For the full article see [[History of Somerset]]''

The [[Somerset Levels]], and specifically the [[dry point]]s such as [[Glastonbury]] and [[Brent Knoll]], have a long history of settlement, and are known to have been settled by [[Mesolithic]] hunters.
<ref name="Mesolithic">{{cite web | title=Somerset | work=Camelot Village: Britain's Heritage and History |url=http://www.camelotintl.com/heritage/counties/england/somerset.html|accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref> 
The caves of the [[Mendip Hills]] were settled during the [[Neolithic]] period and contain extensive [[archaeology|archaeological]] sites such as the [[Cheddar Gorge and Caves|caves of Cheddar Gorge]]. There are numerous [[Iron Age]] [[Hill fort|Hill Forts]], some of which were later reused in the [[Dark Ages]], such as [[Cadbury Castle]].
<ref>{{cite web | title=Mendip Hills An Archaeological Survey of the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty | work=Somerset County Council Archaeological Projects | url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/media/896B4/MendipAONB.pdf| format=pdf | accessdate=2006-10-28}}</ref> 
Somerset, like [[History of Dorset|Dorset]] to the south, held the [[Saxon people|Saxon]] invasion back for over a century, remaining a frontier between the Saxons and the Romano-British Celts. The first known use of the name ''Somers<U+00E6>te'' was in [[845]] after the region fell to the Saxons. After the [[Norman Conquest]] the county was divided into 700 [[Fiefdom|fiefs]], and large areas were owned by the crown.

In the [[English Civil War]] Somerset was largely [[Parliamentarian]]. In [[1685]] the [[Monmouth Rebellion]] was played out in Somerset and neighbouring Dorset. The rebels landed at [[Lyme Regis]] and travelled north hoping to capture [[Bristol]] and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], but were defeated at the [[Battle of Sedgemoor]].

The traditional northern border of the county is the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]], but the administrative boundary has crept southwards, with the creation and expansion of the [[Bristol|City of Bristol]]. 

Somerset contains [[England]]'s oldest [[prison]] still in use, in the small town of [[Shepton Mallet]], and the world's oldest known engineered [[road]]way, the [[Sweet Track]].

==Geology, landscape and ecology==
{{main|Geology of Somerset}}

Much of the landscape of Somerset falls into types determined by the underlying [[geology]]. These landscapes are the [[limestone]] [[karst]] and [[lias]] of the north, the [[clay]] [[vale]]s and [[wetlands]] of the centre, the [[oolite]]s of the east and south, and the [[Devonian]] [[sandstone]] of the west. To the north east of the [[Somerset Levels]], the [[Mendip Hills]] are moderately high, often mountain [[limestone]] [[hill]]s with an extensive network of [[cave]]s and underground [[river]]s and a number of [[gorge]]s, famously [[Cheddar Gorge]]. {{convert|76|sqmi|sqkm|0}} of the central and western Mendip Hills was designated an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] in 1972. The main [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] on these hills is [[calcareous grassland]], with some [[arable]] [[agriculture]]. To the north of the hills is the [[Chew Valley]] and to the south, on the clay substrate, are a number of broad valleys which support [[dairy farming]] and drain into the [[Somerset Levels]]. This expanse of flat land, stretching up to {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} inland, is only a few feet above sea level. Before it was drained, much of the land was under a shallow brackish sea in winter and a marsh in summer. Drainage started in [[ancient Rome|Roman]] times, restarting in [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] times and is continuing now. According to legend [[Joseph of Arimathea]] sailed across the levels to [[Glastonbury]], a dry point near the eastern edge of the levels. In the far west of the county, running into [[Devon]], is [[Exmoor]], a high Devonian sandstone [[moorland|moor]], which was designated as a national park in 1954. The highest point in Somerset is [[Dunkery Beacon]] on Exmoor, with an altitude of {{convert|1704|ft|m|0}}. Over 100 sites have been designated as [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Somerset|Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Somerset]].

The coastline of the [[Bristol Channel]] and [[River Severn|Severn estuary]] forms part of the northern border of Somerset. The Bristol Channel has one of the largest tidal ranges in the world, at [[Burnham-on-Sea]], for example, the tidal range of a spring tide is over {{convert|39|ft|m|0}}. Proposals for the construction of a [[Severn Barrage]] aim to harness this energy. The main coastal towns of today are, from the west to the north east, [[Minehead]], [[Watchet]], Burnham-on-Sea, [[Weston-super-Mare]], [[Clevedon]] and [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]]. The coastal area between Minehead and the eastern extreme of the administrative county<U+2019>s coastline at Brean Down is known as Bridgwater Bay, which is a [[National Nature Reserves in England|National Nature Reserve]].<ref name="topo">{{cite web | title=Somerset Topography | work=Somerset County Council |url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/somerset/cultureheritage/heritage/info/somersetlandscape/ | accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref>  
North of that, the coast forms Weston Bay and Sand Bay, then the Mouth of the Severn.
<ref name="osgb">{{cite map | publisher=Ordnance Survey | title=OS MasterMap | accessdate=2007-04-12}}</ref>

In the mid and north of the county the coastline is low as the flat wetlands of the levels meet the sea. In the west the coastline is high and dramatic as the plateau of Exmoor meets the sea with high [[cliffs]] and [[waterfalls]].<ref name="topo" />

The county has many rivers, including the [[River Axe, Somerset|Axe]], [[River Brue|Brue]], [[River Cary|Cary]], [[River Parrett|Parrett]], Sheppey, [[River Tone|Tone]] and [[Congresbury Yeo|Yeo]]. These both feed and drain the flat levels and moors of mid and west Somerset.<ref name="topo" />

The [[Somerset coalfield]] in the north of the county is part of a larger coalfield which stretches into [[Gloucestershire]].

==Climate==
Along with the rest of [[South West England]], Somerset has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of [[England]]. The annual mean temperature is approximately 10&nbsp;<U+00B0>C and shows a [[seasonal]] and a [[Diurnal motion|diurnal]] variation, but due to the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts of the UK. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1 and 2&nbsp;<U+00B0>C. July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around 21&nbsp;<U+00B0>C.

The number of hours of bright [[Sunlight|sunshine]] is controlled by the length of day and by cloudiness. In general December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south-west of England has a favoured location with respect to the [[Azores]] high pressure when it extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK, particularly in summer. [[Convective]] cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and acts to reduce sunshine amounts. The average annual sunshine totals around 1600 hours.

[[Precipitation (meteorology)|Rainfall]] tends to be associated with [[Atlantic]] [[Low pressure area|depressions]] or with convection. The Atlantic depressions are more vigorous in autumn and winter and most of the rain which falls in those seasons in the south-west is from this source. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower [[cloud]]s and a large proportion of rainfall falls from showers and [[thunderstorms]] at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 31&ndash;35&nbsp;inches (800&ndash;900&nbsp;mm). About 8&ndash;15 days of [[snowfall]] is typical. November to March have the highest mean [[wind]] speeds, with June to August having the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the South West.
<ref name="weather">{{cite web | title=About south-west England | work=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/location/southwestengland/index.html | accessdate=2006-05-28}}</ref>

==Economy and industry==
[[Image:somerset.dunster.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Dunster]] Yarn Market was built in 1609 for the trading of local cloth]]
Somerset has few industrial centres. [[Bridgwater]] was developed during the [[Industrial Revolution]] as the West Country's leading port. [[Yeovil]] is important in the manufacture of [[helicopter]]s. Many towns have developed small-scale [[light industry|light industries]], such as [[Crewkerne]]'s [[Ariel Ltd|Ariel Motor Company, Ltd]], one of the UK's smallest car manufacturers.

[[Agriculture]] continues to be a major business in the county, if no longer a major employer. [[Apple (fruit)|Apple]] [[orchard]]s were once plentiful, and to this day Somerset is linked to the production of strong [[cider]], arguably more so than any other part of the world. The towns of [[Taunton]] and [[Shepton Mallet]] are involved with the production of cider, especially [[Blackthorn Cider]], which is sold nationwide.

Much of the county is scenic and unspoilt. Tourism is a major industry in the county, estimated in [[2001]] to support around 23,000 people.

Attractions include its coastal towns, part of the [[Exmoor National Park]], the [[West Somerset Railway]] (a [[heritage railway]]), and the museum of the [[Fleet Air Arm]] at [[RNAS Yeovilton]]. The town of [[Glastonbury, England|Glastonbury]] is famous for its mythical associations, and open-air [[rock festival]] (actually in [[Pilton, Somerset|Pilton]]), while the [[Cheddar Gorge]] is famous for [[cave]]s open to visitors, as well as its locally produced [[cheese]].

==Culture==
[[Image:Cathedrale_de_wells_front_ouest.JPG|thumb|right|The west front of [[Wells Cathedral]]]]
Somerset has traditions of art, music and literature. [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] wrote while staying in [[Nether Stowey]], [[Alfoxden]] and [[Porlock]] in the west of the county. The writer [[Evelyn Waugh]] spent his last years in the village of [[Combe Florey]]. Traditional folk music, both song and dance, was important in the agricultural communities. Somerset songs were collected by [[Cecil Sharp]] and incorporated into a number of works including [[Gustav Holst|Holst's]] ''[[A Somerset Rhapsody]]''. Halsway Manor near [[Williton]] is an international centre for folk music. The tradition continues today with groups such as [[The Wurzels]].

The [[Glastonbury Festival]] of Performing Arts takes place most years in [[Pilton, Somerset|Pilton]], near [[Shepton Mallet]], attracting over 100,000 music and culture lovers from around the world, and world-famous entertainers.

The annual circuit of [[West Country Carnival]]s is held in a variety of Somerset towns during the autumn, forming a major regional festival, and the largest light festival in Europe.

==Place names==
Somerset settlement names are mostly Anglo-Saxon in origin. A few hill names include [[Brythonic]] elements, for example a charter of 682 concerning Creechborough Hill defines it as "the hill the British call ''Cructan'' and we call ''Crychbeorh''". A few modern names are Brythonic in origin, such as Tarnock, while a few others have both Saxon and Brythonic elements such as Penhill.

Many of the river names are Brythonic, while a few may be pre-British such as Parret (earlier Pedred).
