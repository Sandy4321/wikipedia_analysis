The '''Greenlandic language''' is an [[Eskimo-Aleut languages|Eskimo-Aleut language]] spoken by about 57,000 people in [[Greenland]] and [[Denmark]]. It is closely related to the [[Inuit language]]s in [[Canada]], such as [[Inuktitut]]. The main dialect, '''Kalaallisut''' or West Greenlandic, has been the official language of the Greelandic autonomous territory since June 2009. Other dialects are [[East Greenlandic]] (Tunumiisut) and the Thule dialect [[Inuktun]]. Greenlandic is a [[Polysynthesis|polysynthetic]] language that allows the creation of long words by stringing together [[Root (linguistics)|roots]] and [[suffix]]es. Its morphosyntactic alignment is [[Ergative-absolutive language|ergative]]. Nouns are inflected for one of the eight cases and for possession. Verbs are inflected for one of the eight moods and for the number and person of its subject and object. Both nouns ad verbs have complex derivational morphology. Basic word order in transitive clauses is [[Subject Object Verb]]. The language is written in the Latin script, and underwent an extensive orthographic reform in 1973. It is an ongoing debate in linguistics whether Greenlandic has grammatical [[Tense (grammar)|tense]] or not; several linguists regard the language as esssentially tenseless. Another unanswered question is whether the language has [[Noun incorporation]], or whether the processes that create complex predicates that include nominal roots are derivational in nature.

==History==
The Greenlandic language was brought to Greenland with the arrival of the [[Thule culture]] in the 13th century. It is unknown which languages were spoken by the earlier [[Saqqaq culture|Saqqaq]] and [[Dorset culture|Dorset]] cultures in Greenland.
The first descriptions of Greenlandic date from the 17th century, and with the arrival of Danish missionaries in the early 18th century the elaboration of dictionaries and grammar description began to implemented.  [[Paul Egede]] wrote the first Greenlandic dictionary in 1750, and the first grammar in 1760.<ref name="encyc"/>

[[File:Inuktitut dialect map.png|350px|right|thumb|Illustration 1: Distribution of Inuit language variants across the Arctic.]]
From the time of the Danish colonization of Greenland in the [[18th century]] to the beginning of Greenlandic homerule in 1979, Greenlandic experienced increasing pressure from the Danish language. In the 1950s, Danish linguistic policies in Greenland were aimed to replace Greenlandic with Danish in Greenlandic society.  Of most importance was that post primary education and the language of government were conducted in Danish.<ref name="SocEd"/>

From 1851 to 1973 Greenlandic was written in a complicated orthography devised by the missionary linguist [[Samuel Kleinschmidt]], but in 1973 a new orthography was introduced, intended to bring the written language closer to the spoken standard, which had changed considerably since Kleinschmidt's times. The reform was effective and in the years following it Greenlandic literacy received a boost.<ref name="SocEd">Goldbach & Winther-Jensen (1988)</ref>

Since 1979 a Greenlandic policy of "greenlandization" has reversed the former trend, and monolingual Danish speaking parents in Greenland are now raising bilingual-Danish/Greenlandic speaking children, thanks to a Greenlandic-only policy in primary schooling.<ref>Iutzi-Mitchell & Graburn (1993)</ref> 

Before June 2009, Greenlandic shared its status as the official language in Greenland with [[Danish language|Danish]].<ref group="note">According to the Namminersornerullutik Oqartussat / Gr<U+00F8>nlands Hjemmestyres (Greenlands Home, official website): <U+00AB> ''Language. The official languages are Greenlandic and Danish... Greenlandic is the language used in schools and dominates in most towns and settlements'' <U+00BB>. [http://uk.nanoq.gl/Emner/About/Culture.aspx]</ref> Since then, Greenlandic has become the sole official language.<ref name="law"/> This has made Greenlandic a unique example of an [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous language of the Americas]] that serves exclusively as an official language of a semi-independent country, yet it is still considered to be in a "vulnerable" state by the UNESCO [[Red Book of Endangered Languages|Red Book of Language Endangerment]].<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World<U+2019>s Languages in Danger]</ref> The country has a 100% literacy rate.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gl.html|title= Greenland|work= CIA World Factbook|date= 2008-06-19|accessdate= 2008-07-11}}</ref>

==Classification==
Kalaallisut and the other Greenlandic dialects belong to the [[Eskimo-Aleut languages|Eskimo-Aleut family]] and are closely related to the [[Inuit languages]] of [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]]. Illustration 1 shows the locations of the different Eskimoan languages, among them the three main dialects of Greenlandic.

The most prominent Greenlandic dialect is '''Western Greenlandic''' ''(Kalaallisut),'' which is the official language of Greenland. The name ''Kalaallisut'' is often used as a cover term for all of Greenlandic. The northern dialect, ''[[Inuktun]] (Avanersuarmiutut),'' spoken in the vicinity of the city of [[Qaanaaq]] (Thule) is particularly closely related to Canadian Inuktitut. The Eastern dialect ''(Tunumiit oraasiat)'' is spoken in the vicinity of the towns of [[Ammassalik]] and [[Scoresbysund]] and is the most innovative of the Greenlandic dialects, having assimilated consonant clusters and vowel sequences even more than West Greenlandic.<ref name="MahieuTersis"/> Kalaallisut is further divided into four subdialects: one spoken around [[Upernavik]] which has certain similarities to Eastern Greenlandic, possibly because of a previous migration from eastern Greenland; and a second dialect spoken in the area of [[Uummannaq]] and the [[Disko Bay]]. The standard language is based on the central kalaallisut dialect spoken in [[Sisimiut]] in the north, around [[Nuuk]] and as far south as [[Maniitsoq]]. Southern Kalaallisut is spoken around [[Narsaq]] and [[Qaqortoq]] in the south.<ref name="encyc">Rischel, J<U+00F8>rgen. Gr<U+00F8>nlandsk sprog.[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Sprog/Eskimoisk_sprog/gr%C3%B8nlandsk?highlight=gr%C3%B8nlandsk] [[Den Store Danske Encyklop<U+00E6>di]] Vol. 8, Gyldendal</ref> Table 1 shows the differences in the pronunciation of the word for "humans" in the three main dialects. It can be seen that Inuktun is the most conservative, and Tunumiisut the most innovative.

[[Michael Fortescue]], a specialist in [[Eskimo-Aleut languages|Eskimo-Aleut]] as well as in Chukotko-Kamchatkan, argues for a link between [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Yukaghir]], [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan]], and Eskimo-Aleut in ''Language Relations Across Bering Strait'' (1998). He calls this proposed grouping [[Uralo-Siberian languages|Uralo-Siberian]].

==Phonology==
In this section letters between slashes // mean [[Phoneme|phonemic transcription]], letters in square brackets mean [[International Phonetic Alphabet|phonetic transcription]] and letters in triangular brackets <nowiki><></nowiki> mean orthographic rendering according to the standard Greenlandic orthography.<ref group="note">The most thorough study of Greenlandic phonology is [[J<U+00F8>rgen Rischel|Rischel, J<U+00F8>rgen]] (1974) ''Topics in West Greenlandic Phonology''. Copenhagen: Akademisk Forlag.</ref>

===Vowels===
Greenlandic' three vowel system, composed of /i/, /u/ and /a/, is typical for an Eskimo-Aleout language. Before an [[uvular consonant]] ({{IPA|[q]}} or {{IPA|[<U+0281>]}}) /i/ is realized allophonically as {{IPA|[e]}} or {{IPA|[<U+025B>]}} and /u/ as {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[<U+0254>]}}. This alternation is shown in the modern standard orthography by writing /i/ and /u/ as <e> and <o> respectively when occurring before uvulars (<q> and <r>). Double vowels are pronounced as two [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]s, so they are phonologically a vowel sequence and not a long vowel; they are also written as two vowels in the orthography.<ref>Rischel (1974) pp. 79 - 80</ref> The only diphthong in the language is /ai/ which only occurs at the end of words.<ref>Bj<U+00F8>rnum (2003) p. 16</ref> For example:

:/''ui''/ "husband" pronounced [ui].
:/''uiqarpuq''/ "she has a husband" pronounced {{IPA|[ueqa<U+0281>p<U+0254>q]}} and written <ueqarpoq>.

:/''illu''/ "house" pronounced [i<U+026B>:u].
:/''illuqarpuq''/ "he has a house" pronounced {{IPA|[i<U+026B>:oqa<U+0281>p<U+0254>q]}} and written <illoqarpoq>.

===Consonants===
Greenlandic has consonants at five different points of articulation: [[Labial consonant|labial]], [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], [[Palatal consonant|palatal]], [[Velar consonant|velar]] and [[Uvular consonant|uvular]]. It does not have a [[phoneme|phonemic]] [[voicing]] contrast, but rather distinguishes plain stops from fricatives. It distinguishes stops, fricatives and nasals at the labial, alveolar, velar and uvular points of articulation.<ref group="note">The uvular nasal {{IPA|[<U+0274>]}} is not found in all dialects and there is dialectal variability regarding its degree of phonemicness (Rischel 1974:176-181)</ref> The earlier palatal sibilant {{IPA|[<U+0283>]}} has merged with {{IPA|[s]}} in all but a few dialects.<ref>Rischel (1974) pp.173-177</ref> The labiodental fricative {{IPA|[f]}} is only contrastive in [[loanword]]s. The alveolar stop {{IPA|[t]}} is pronounced as an affricate {{IPA|[t<U+0361>s]}} before the high front vowel /i/. Often Danish loanwords are written with Danish letters for voiced stops <nowiki><b d g></nowiki>, for example ''<baaja>'' "beer" and ''<Guuti>'' "God" but in Greenlandic these stops are pronounced exactly as if they began with /p t k/ i.e. {{IPA|[pa:ja]}} and {{IPA|[ku:t<sup>s</sup>i]}}.<ref name="encyc"/>

===Phonological constraints===
The Kalaallisut syllable is simple, allowing syllables of (C)(V)V(C), where C is a consonant and V is a vowel and VV is a double vowel or wordfinal /ai/.<ref>Fortescue(1984) p. 338</ref> Native words may begin only with a vowel or with /p, t, k, q, s, m, n/; they may end only with /p, t, k, q/ and rarely /n/. 

Consonant clusters only occur over syllable boundaries and their pronunciation is subject to regressive assimilations converting them into geminates. All non nasal consonants in a cluster are voiceless.
<ref>Sadock (2003) pp. 20-21</ref>

===Prosody===
Greenlandic prosody does not include [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] as an autonomous category, instead [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] is determined by [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]] and durational parameters.<ref>Jacobsen (2000)</ref> [[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]] is influenced by syllable weight: heavy syllables are pronounced in a way that may be perceived as stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters. In words with less than four syllables without long vowels or consonant clusters, the last syllable is stressed. In words without long vowels or consonant clusters the antepenultimate syllable is stressed. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster.<ref name="BjornumProsody">Bj<U+00F8>rnum (2003) pp. 23-26</ref>

Geminate consonants are pronounced long, almost exactly with the double duration of a single consonant.<ref>Sadock (2003) p. 2</ref>

Intonantion in indicative clauses usually rises on the antepenultimate syllable, falls on the penult and rises on the last syllable. Interrogative intonation rises on the penultimate and falls on the last syllable.<ref name="BjornumProsody"/><ref>Fortescue (1984) p. 5</ref>

===Morphophonology===
Greenlandic phonology distinguishes itself phonologically from the other Inuit languages by a series of assimilations. 

Greenlandic phonology allows clusters, but it does not allow clusters of two different consonants unless the first one is /r/. The second consonant in a cluster is always assimilated to the first one resulting in a geminate consonant. Geminate /tt/ is pronounced [ts] and written <ts>. Geminate /ll/ is pronounced [<U+026B><U+02D0>] (/l/ is also devoiced to [<U+026B>] after r). Geminate /gg/ is pronounced [<U+00E7><U+02D0>]. Geminate /vv/ is pronounced [f<U+02D0>] and written <ff>. /v/ is also pronounced and written as [f] after r.<ref>Bj<U+00F8>rnum,(2003) p. 27</ref> 

These assimilations mean that one of the most famous Inuktitut words, ''iglu'' ("house"), is ''illu'' in Greenlandic, where the /gl/ consonant cluster of Inuktitut is assimilated into an unvoiced lateral affricate. And that the word ''Inuktitut'' itself, when translated into Kalaallisut, is ''Inuttut''. The Old Greenlandic diphthong /au/ has become assimilated to /aa/.

The consonant /v/ has disappeared when occurring between /u/ and /i/ or /a/; in these environments it is neither pronounced nor written. This means that affixes beginning with -va or -vi have forms without [v] when suffixed on stems ending in /u/.

The vowel /i/ of modern Greenlandic is the result of an historic merger of the Proto-Eskimo-Aleut vowels *i and *<U+026A>. The fourth vowel was still present in Old Greenlandic as attested by [[Hans Egede]].<ref>Rischel (1985) pp. 553</ref> In modern west Greenlandic the difference between the two original vowels can only be discerned [[morphophonology|morphophonologically]] in certain environments. The vowel that was originally *<U+026A>, called /i<sup>2</sup>/ in Greenlandic phonological studies, has the variant [a] when preceding another vowel and it sometimes disappears before certain suffixes.<ref>Underhill (1976)</ref>

The degree to which the assimilation of consonant clusters has taken place is an important dialectal feature separating Polar Eskimo, [[Inuktun]], which still allows some ungeminated consonant clusters, from Western and Eastern Greenlandic. Eastern Greenlandic has shifted some geminate consonants, e.g. [<U+026B><U+02D0>] to [t<U+02D0>]. In Tunumiisut, for example, the name of the town of [[Scoresbysund]] is ''ittoqqotoormiit'' which would be ''illoqqortoormiut'' in Kalaallisut.<ref name="Mennecier"/><ref name="MahieuTersis">Mahieu & Tersis (2009) p. 53</ref>

==Grammar==
[[File:Parkverbot.JPG.jpg|350px|thumb|A bilingual sign in Nuuk, showing the stark contrast between [[Danish language|Danish]] (which is related to [[English language|English]]) and Kalaallisut (which is not). The sign translates to "parking forbidden for all vehicles".]]
The morphology of Greenlandic is highly [[polysynthetic|synthetic]] and exclusively suffixing.<ref>Sadock (2003) p. 12</ref> It creates very long words by means of adding strings of suffixes to a stem. <ref group="note">For example the word ''Nalunaarasuartaatilioqateeraliorfinnialikkersaatiginialikkersaatilillaranatagoorunarsuarooq'' which means something like "Once again they tried to build a giant radiostation, but it was apparently only on the drawing board"</ref> In principle there is no limit to the length of a Greenlandic word, but in practice words with more than half a dozen derivational suffixes, and the average number of morphemes per word is 3 to 5.<ref>Sadock (2003) pp. 3 & 8</ref><ref group="note">compare with the English rate of slightly more than one morpheme per word.</ref> The language employs around 318 inflectional suffixes and between four and five hundred derivational ones.<ref>Fortescue & Lennert Olsen (1992) p. 112</ref> 

There are few compound words, but lots of derivations.<ref>Sadock (2003) p. 11</ref> The grammar employs a mixture of [[Head-marking language|head]] and [[Dependent-marking language|dependent marking]]: both agent and [[Patient (grammar)|patient]] are marked on the predicate and the possessor is marked on nouns, while dependent noun phrases inflect for case. The morpho-syntactic alignment of Kalaallisut is [[Ergative language|ergative]].

The language distinguishes four persons (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 3rd reflexive), two numbers (singular and plural; no dual as in Inuktitut), eight moods (indicative, participial, imperative, optative, past subjunctive, future subjunctive and habitual subjunctive) and ten cases (absolutive, ergative, equative, instrumental, locative, allative, ablative and prolative). Verbs carry bipersonal inflection for subject and object (distinguished by person and number). Possessed noun phrases inflect for person and number of their possessor, as well a for case.<ref>Bj<U+00F8>rnum (2003) pp. 33-34</ref>
 
In this section examples are written in Greenlandic standard orthography except that morpheme boundaries are indicated by a hyphen. 

===Syntax===
Greenlandic distinguishes three [[Open class (linguistics)|open word classes]]: [[noun]]s, [[verb]]s and particles. Verbs inflect for person and number of subject and object, and for mood. Nouns inflect for possession and for case. Particles do not inflect.<ref name="Bj<U+00F8>rnum 2003">Bj<U+00F8>rnum (2003)</ref>

Verb:
:''Oqar-poq'' "he says"
:say-HE/INDICATIVE

Noun:
:''Angut''  "A man"
:man.ABS

Particle:
:''Naamik'' "No"
:No

The verb is the only word required to build a sentence. Since verbs inflect for number and person of both subject and object, the verb is in fact a clause itself. This means that Greenlandic is a so-called [[pro-drop]] language that allows noun phrases to be left out. Therefore, clauses where all participants are expressed as free-standing noun phrases are rather rare.<ref name="Bj<U+00F8>rnum 2003"/> The following examples show the possibilities of leaving out these verbal arguments:

Intransitive clause with no subject noun phrase:
:''Sini-ppoq'' "(S)he sleeps"
:sleep-HE/INDICATIVE

Intransitive clause with subject noun phrase:
:''Angut sinippoq'' "the man sleeps"
:man.ABS sleep-HE/INDICATIVE

Transitive clause with no overt arguments:
:''Asa-vaa'' "(S)he loves him/her/it"
:love-HE/HE

Transitive clause with agent noun phrase:
:''Angu-p asa-vaa'' "the man loves her"
:man-ERG love-HE/HE

Transitive clause with patient noun phrase:
:''Arnaq asa-vaa'' "he loves the woman"
:woman.ABS love-HE/HE

====Morphosyntactic alignment====
The Greenlandic language uses [[case (grammar)|case]] to express grammatical relations between participants in a sentence. Nouns are inflected with one of the two core cases or one of the six oblique cases.<ref>Bj<U+00F8>rnum (2003) p. 71</ref> 

Greenlandic is an [[Ergative-absolutive language|ergative]] language. This means that, instead of treating the [[morphosyntax|grammatical relations]] as in most European languages where grammatical [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] are marked with [[nominative case]] and [[object (grammar)|objects]] with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently. In Greenlandic instead the ergative case is used for [[Agent (grammar)|agent]]s of transitive verbs and for possessors. Absolutive case is used for patients of transitive nouns and subjects of intransitive nouns.<ref>Bj<U+00F8>rnum (2003) pp. 71-72</ref> Research of Greenlandic as used by the younger generations of Greenlanders, has shown that the use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into an [[nominative-accusative language]].<ref>Langg<U+00E5>rd, Karen (2009) "Grammatical structures in Greenlandic as found in texts written by young Greenlanders at the turn of the millenium" chapter 15 in Mahieu & Tersis (2009) pp. 231-247</ref>

Intransitive:
:''Anda sini-ppoq'' "Anda sleeps"
:Anda.ABS sleep-HE/IND

Transitive with agent and object:
:''Anda-p nanoq taku-aa'' "Anda sees a bear" 
:Anda.ERG bear-ABS see-HE/HE

====Word order====
In transitive clauses where both object and subject are expressed as free noun phrases, basic word order is [[Subject Object Verb|SOXV]], where X is a a noun phrase in one of the oblique cases. In contrast to other [[Polysynthesis|polysynthetic]] languages and also other Eskimoan languages which have rather free word order, Greenlandic word order is quite fixed. 

In copula clauses the order is usually Subject-Copula-Complement. As the possessor precedes the possessum and heads precede their modifiers, this order is strictly obligatory.<ref>Fortescue (1993) p. 269-270</ref>

:''Andap tujuuluk pisiaraa'' "Anda bought the sweater"
:Anda  sweater  bought
:S      O         V

An appositional phrase appears after its head noun. 
:''Andap tujuuluk tungujortok pisiaraa'' "Anda bought the blue sweater"
:Anda sweater blue bought
:S      O       X    V

An appositional phrase to an incorporated noun appears after the verb:
:''Anda sanasuuvoq pikkorissoq'' "Anda is a skilled carpenter"
:Anda carpenter.IS skilled
:S     V          APP

[[Topic (linguistics)|Topical]] noun phrases occur at the beginning of a clause whereas new or emphasized information generally come last. This is generally the verb, but it can also be a foregrounded grammatical subject or object. In spoken language also "afterthought" material or clarifications may follow the verb, usually in a lowered pitch.<ref>Fortescue (1993) p. 269</ref>

====Coordination and Subordination====
Syntactic [[Coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] and [[Subordination (linguistics)|subordination]] is done by combining predicates in the superordinate moods (indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative) with predicates in the subordinate moods (conditional, causative, contemporative and participial). The contemporative has both coordinative and subordinative functions depending on context.<ref>Fortescue(1984) p. 34</ref> The relative order of the main clause and any coordinate or subordinate clauses is relatively free, and mostly subject to [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] concerns.<ref>Fortescue (1993) p. 270</ref>

====Obviation and switch reference====
The Greenlandic pronominal system includes a distinction known as [[obviative|obviation]]<ref>Bittner (1995) p. 80</ref> or [[switch reference]]<ref>Fortescue 1991. 53 ff.</ref>: There is a special so-called fourth person<ref>Woodbury (1983)</ref> used to mark when a third person subject of a subordinate verb or the possessor of a noun is coreferent with the third person subject of the matrix clause.<ref>Bj<U+00F8>rnum (2003) pp. 152-154</ref> Below are given examples of the difference between third and fourth person:

:''illu-a taku-aa'' "he saw his (the other man's) house"
:house-3POSS see-HE/IT

:''illu-ni taku-aa'' "he saw his own house"
:house-4POSS see-HE/IT

:''Ole oqar-poq tillu-kkiga'' "Ole said I had hit him (the other man)"
:Ole say-HE hit-I/him3

:''Ole oqar-poq tillu-kkini'' "Ole said I had hit him (Ole)"
:Ole say-HE hit-I/him4

:''Eva iser-uni sini-ssaa-q'' "When Eva comes in she'll sleep"
:Eva come.in-She4 sleep-FUT-she

:''Eva iser-pat sini-ssaa-q'' When Eva comes in (s)he'll sleep (someone else).
:Eva come.in-She3 sleep-FUT-(s)he

====Indefiniteness construction====

There is no category of [[definiteness]] in Greenlandic, instead the status of participants as either new information or already known to the listener is encoded by other means. Specifically, transitivity related morphology such as the use of the construction sometimes called antipassive <ref>Kappel Schmidt (2003)</ref><ref name="Sadock 2003">Sadock (2003)</ref><ref name="Bittner 1987">Bittner (1987)</ref> or intransitive object<ref>Fortescue (1984) p. 92 & p. 249</ref> conveys this meaning, and is used, along with strategies of noun incorporation of non-topical noun phrases, to encode information status.<ref name="Bittner 1987"/><ref>Hallman, Peter (n.d.) "Definiteness in Inuktitut"[http://hallklar.bol.ucla.edu/Inuktitut.pdf] p. 2</ref><ref>van Geenhoven (1998)</ref>

Active:
:''Piitap arfeq takuaa'' "Peter saw the whale"
:Peter-ERG whale see

Antipassive/intransitive object:
:''Piitaq arfermik takuvoq'' "Peter saw (a) whale"
:Peter-ABS whale-INSTR see

===Verbs===
Greenlandic verbs are morphologically enormously complex. The two main processes are inflection and derivation. Inflectional morphology includes the processes of obligatory inflection for mood, person, and voice (tense/aspect is not an obligatory inflectional category<ref name="Shaer">Shaer (2003)</ref><ref name="Bittner2005">Bittner (2005)</ref><ref name="HayashiSprenger">Hayashi& Spreng (2005)</ref>). Derivational morphology includes processes of adverbial modification of verbs by a large number of different suffixes (numbering in their hundreds). Many of these suffixes are so semantically salient that they are often referred to as [[postbase]]s rather than suffixes, especially in the American tradition of Eskimo grammar.<ref>Fortescue (1980) note 1</ref>Such semantically "heavy" suffixes may express concepts such as "to have", "to be", "to say", or "to think". The Greenlandic verb word consists of a root + derivational suffixes/postbases + inflectional suffixes. Tense and aspect is marked by optional suffixes that appear between the derivational and inflectional suffixes.

====Inflection====
Greenlandic verbs inflect for [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with agent and patient, for mood and voice. It distinguishes 8 moods, four of which are used in independent clauses and four of which are used in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative and participial. Verbal roots can take either transitive or intransitive inflections and all the mood suffixes have both transitive and intransitive forms. They also have a separate negative form.<ref>Bj<U+00F8>rnum (2003)p. 35-50</ref> This gives a total of 24 different inflectional paradigms. The inflectional system is further complicated by the fact that transitive suffixes encode both patient and agent in a single morpheme, requiring 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient for each of the eight transitive paradigms.

'''Indicative and interrogative moods'''

Indicative mood is used in all independent expository clauses. The interrogative mood is used for posing questions. Questions with the question particle ''imaqa'' "maybe" cannot use the interrogative mood.<ref>Bj<U+00F8>rnum (2003) p. 39</ref>

:no, be.sick-NEG-I/IND

In table 5. shows the intransitive indicative inflection for patient person and number of the verb ''neri-'' "to eat" in indicative and interrogative moods (question mark marks interrogative intonation - questions have falling intonation on the last syllable as opposed to most indo-european languages in which questions are marked by rising intonation). Both the indicative and the interrogative mood have both a transitive and an intransitive inflection, but here only the intransitive inflection is given.

Table 6. shows the transitive indicative inflection for patient person and number of the verb ''asa-'' "to love" (an asterisk means that this form does not occur as such but would have to use a different reflexive inflection).

'''Imperative and Optative moods'''

Imperative mood is used to issue orders. It is always combined with the second person. Optative is used to express wishes or exhortations and is never used with the second person. There is a negative imperative form used to issue prohibitions. Both optative and imperative exists in transitive and intransitive paradigms. There are in fact two transitive positive imperative paradigms, a standard one and one which is considered rude and is mostly used when adressing children.<ref>Bj<U+00F8>rnum (2003) p. 40-42</ref>

:''sini-langa'' "let's sleep"
:sleep-1p.OPT

:''sini-nak''! "Don't sleep!"
:sleep-NEG.IMP

'''Conditional mood'''

The conditional mood is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning "if" or "when".<ref>Bj<U+00F8>rnum (2003) p. 45</ref> 

:''seqinner-pat Eva ani-ssaa-q'' "If the sun shines Eva will go out"
:Sunshine-COND Eva go.out-FUT/SHE

'''Causative mood'''

The causative mood is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning "because" or "since" or "when"; it is also sometimes used with the meaning of "that". Often the causative is used as a main clause, but it then implies some underlying cause.<ref>Bj<U+00F8>rnum(2003) pp. 43-44</ref>

:''qasu-gami innar-poq'' "he went to bed because he was tired"
:be.tired-CAU/HE go.to.bed-HE

:''matta-tor-ama'' "I've eaten blubber (that's why I'm not hungry)"
:blubber-eat-CAU/I 

:''ani-guit eqqaama-ssa-vat teriannia-qar-mat'' "if you go out, remember that there are foxes"
:go.out-COND/YOU remember-fut-IMP fox-are-CAUS

'''Contemporative mood'''

The contemporative mood is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning of "being x" or "x ing". It is only used if the subject of the subordinate clause is coreferent with the subject of the matrix clause. If the two clauses have different subjects the participial mood or the causative mood is used. It can also be used to form complement clauses for expression verbs.<ref>Bj<U+00F8>rnum(2003) pp.46-49</ref>

:''qasu-llunga angerlar-punga'' "being tired, I went home"
:be.tired-CONT/I go.home-I

:''98-inik ukio-qar-luni toqu-voq'' "being 98-years old, he died/he was 98 when he died"
:98-INSTR/PL year-have-CONT/HE die-HE

:''Eva oqar-poq kammi-t akiler-lugit'' "Eva said she had paid for the boots"
:Eva say-SHE boot-PL pay-CONT/SHE

'''Participial mood'''

The participial mood is used to construct a subordinate clause with the meaning "that", "when" or "as". It is used when the matrix clause and the subordinate clause have different subjects. It is often used in appositional phrases such as [[relative clauses]].<ref>Bj<U+00F8>rnum (2003) pp. 50-51</ref>

:''atuar-toq taku-ara'' "I saw him read/I saw that he read"
:read-PART/HE see-I/HIM

:''neriu-ppunga tiki-ssa-soq'' "I hope he is coming/I hope he'll come"
:hope-I come-FUT-PART/HE

====Derivation====
Verbal derivation is extremely productive and Greenlandic employs many hundreds derivational suffixes. Often a single verb will use more than one derivational suffix, leading to very long words. Below are given some examples of how derivational suffixes can change the meaning of verbs.

-''katap''- "be tired of"
:''taku-katap-para'' "I am tired of seeing it"
:see-tired.of-I/IT

-''ler''- "begin to/be about to"
:''neri-ler-pugut'' "we are about to eat"
:eat-begin-WE

-''llaqip''- "be proficient at"
:''erinar-su-llaqip-poq'' "She is good at singing"
:sing-HAB-proficiently-SHE

-''niar''- "plans to/wants to"
:''aallar-niar-poq'' "he plans to travel"
:travel-plan-HE

:''angerlar-niar-aluar-punga'' "I was planning to go home though"
:go.home-plan-though-I

-''ngajappoq''- "almost"
:''sini-ngajap-punga'' "I had almost fallen asleep"
:sleep-almost-I

-''nikuu-nngila''- "has never"
:''taku-nikuu-nngila-ra'' "I have never seen it"
:see-never-NEG-IT

-''nnitsoor''- "not anyway/afterall"
:''tiki-nngitsoor-poq'' "he hasn't arrived afterall"
:arrive-not.afterall-HE

====Tense====
It is an open discussion among specialists in Greenlandic whether the language should be considered to have [[Tense (grammar)|tense]] or not. Because the manner by which the language refers to time grammatically is so different from European languages, it becomes a question of whether the Greenlandic method qualifies as being the same thing as what is usually referred to as tense in European languages. Proponents of classifying Greenlandic as a tenseless language hold that since time is not a part of the Greenlandic inflectional system and most verbal forms can be interpreted as either past, present or future according to context, Greenlandic does not have grammatical tense.<ref name="Shaer"/><ref name="Bittner2005"/> Other scholars hold that since Greenlandic is perfectly capable of constructing verbs that have only one possible temporal reading by using different derivational affixes related to time, it does have grammatical tense.<ref name="HayashiSprenger"/> The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic  expresses temporal relations.

All verbs can take past readings with the simple indicative or interrogative moods; some verbs can also take present readings. Whether a verb can take present readings or not is determined by their semantics: verbs that describe a change of state take past readings whereas verbs that describe states can take either past or present readings depending on context. Verbs can be fixed in time by using different derivational affixes expressing pastness, presentness or futurity of time, or by using temporal expressions like "today", "yesterday" or "tomorrow" in the clause.<ref>Bj<U+00F8>rnum (2003) pp. 37-38</ref><ref>Trondhjem, Naja Frederikke, "The marking of past time in Kalaallisut", in Mahieu & Tersis (2009) p. 180-181</ref>

:''aserorpoq'' "it is broken/it broke"

:''siallerpoq'' "it rained/it rains"
:''itsaq siallerpoq'' "in the old days it rained" (''itsaq'' = "in the old days")
:''massakkut siallerpoq'' "its raining now" (''massakkut'' = "now")

The derivational suffix -''ssaa''- is used to express events that are predicted to take place in the future:
:''unnugu siallerssaaq'' "it will rain tonight" (''unnugu'' = "tonight")

The derivational suffix -''sima''- is used to express events that concluded at some moment in the past or which one has been told about, it is often translated with the perfect past or with a hearsay marker. The derivational suffix -''reer''- is used to express events that happened and which were supposed to happen, it is often translated with "already" The derivational suffix -''ler''- expresses events that are just about to begin or which have just begun.

:''aallarpoq'' "he left/he leaves"
:''aallarsimavoq'' "he has left (they say)"
:''aallareerpoq'' "he has already left"

:''nerivoq'' "he ate/he eats"
:''nerereerpoq'' "he already ate/he finished eating"
:''nerilerpoq'' "he's about to eat"

====Noun Incorporation====
It is also an ongoing debate in the linguistc literature whether Greenlandic has [[noun incorporation]] or not. This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root can be incorporated into almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning. On the other hand Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots. The question then becomes whether to analyse this verb formation as incorporation or as denominal verbal derivation. Greenlandic has a number of [[morpheme]]s that require a noun root as their host and which form complex predicates that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation. Linguists who propose  that Greenlandic does have incorporation argue these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses.<ref name="Sadock 2003"/><ref>Sadock (1980)</ref><ref>Sadock(1986)</ref> <ref>Sadock (1999)</ref><ref>[http://bulba.sdsu.edu/~malouf/papers/greenlandic.pdf Malouf (1999)]</ref><ref>van Geenhoven (2002)</ref> This argument is supported by the fact that many morphemes require a nominal work almost syntactically identically as canonical noun incorporation and allow the formation of words that express an entire sentence with verb, subject and object in English. Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs. This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element.<ref>Mithun (1986)</ref><ref>Mithun (1984)</ref><ref>Rosen (1989)</ref> The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots.

''qimmeq'' "dog" + ''-qar- "have"
:''qimme-qar-poq'' "he has a dog"
:dog-have-HE

''illu'' "house" + -'lior''- "make"
:''illu-lior-poq'' "he makes a house"

''kaffi'' "coffee" + -''tor''- "drink/eat"
:kaffi-tor-poq "he drinks coffee"

''puisi'' "seal" + -''niar''- "hunt"
:puisi-niar-poq "he hunts seal"

''allagaq'' "letter" + -''si''- "receive"
:allagar-si-voq "he has received a letter"

''anaana'' "mother" + -''a''- "to be"
:anaana-a-voq "She is a mother"

===Nouns===
Nouns are obligatorily inflected for case and number and optionally for number and person of possessor. Singular and plural are distinguished and 8 cases used: absolutive, ergative (relative), instrumental, allative, locative, ablative, prosecutive (also called vialis or prolative), and equative.<ref>Fortescue (1984) p. 71</ref> Case and number is marked by a single suffix. Nouns can also be derived from verbs or from other nouns by a number of suffixes. e.g. ''atuar''- "to read" + -''toq'' becomes ''atuartoq'' "student" or ''atuar'' + -''fik'' "place" becomes ''atuarfik'' "school". 

The fact that the possessive agreement suffixes on nouns and the transitive agreement suffixes on verbs have quite similar shapes has caused some scholars to interpret Greenlandic as having a distinction between transitive and intransitive nouns, parallel to the same distinction in the verbs.<ref>Sadock (2003) p. 5</ref> <ref group="note">For example the suffix with the shape -aa means "His/Hers/its" when suffixed to a noun, but "him/her/it" when suffixed to a verb, likewise the suffix -ra means either "my" or "me" depending on whether it is suffixed on a verb or a noun.</ref>

====Oblique Cases====
The use of the two grammatical core cases Ergative and Absolutive are used to express grammatical and syntactical roles of participant noun phrases. The oblique case express information relating to movement and manner.

The [[instrumental case]] is versatile. It is used for the instrument with which an action is carried out, for oblique objects of intransitive verbs (also called [[antipassive]] verbs)<ref name="Sadock 2003"/><ref>Kappel Schmidt (2003) passim</ref><ref>Bittner (1987) passim</ref> and for secondary objects of transitive verbs.<ref>Bj<U+00F8>rnum (2003) p. 73</ref>

It is also used for the meaning of "give me":
:''imer-mik''! "(give me) water"
:water-INSTR

And for forming adverbs from nouns
:
:sivisuu-mik sinip-poq "he slept late"
:late-INSTR sleep-HE

The [[allative case]] describes movment towards something.<ref name="BjornumCase">Bj<U+00F8>rnum (2003) p.74</ref>.
:''illu-mut'' "towards the house"

It is also used with numerals and the question word ''qassit'' to express time of clock, and to mean "per"
:''qassi-nut? pingasu-nut''. "When? At three o'clock"
:when-ALL three-ALL

:kiilu-mut tivi krone-qar-poq "it costs 20 crowns per kilo"
:kilo-ALL twenty crown-have-IT

The locative case describes location in a space.<ref name="BjornumCase"/>
:''illu-mi'' "in the house"

The [[ablative case]] describes movement away from something or the source of something<ref name="BjornumCase"/>

:''Rasmussi-mit allagarsi-voq'' "he got a letter from Rasmussi"
:Rasmus-ABL receiveletter-HE

:''tuttu-mit nassuk'' " (antler)horn from a rein-deer"
:rein.deer-ABL horn

The [[prosecutive case]] (also called vialis or prolative) describes movement through something, also the medium of writing or a location on the body. It is also used to describe a group of people, for example a family.<ref name="BjornumCase2">Bj<U+00F8>rnum (2003) p. 75</ref>

:''matu-kkut iser-poq'' "he entered through the door"

:''su-kkut tillup-paatit''? "where did he hit you (on the body)"
: where-PROS hit-HE/YOU

:''palasi-kkut'' "the priest and his family"
:priest-PROS

In Greenlandic possession is marked on the noun which agrees with the person and number of its possessor. The possessor is in the ergative case. There are different possessive paradigms for all of the different cases.<ref>Bj<U+00F8>rnum (2003)  p. 86</ref> Table 4. gives the possessive paradigm for the absolutive case of ''illu'' "house". Below are given examples of the use of the possessive inflection, the use of the ergatve case for possessors and the use of fourth person possessors.

:''Anda-p illu-a'' "Andas house"
:Anda-ERG house-HE3/POSS

:''Anda-p illu-ni taku-aa'' "Anda sees his own house"
:Anda-ERG house-HE4/POSS see-HE/IT

:''Anda-p illu-a taku-aa'' "Anda see's his (the other man's) house"
:''Anda-ERG house-HE3/POSS see-HE/IT

==Vocabulary==
Greenlandic vocabulary is mostly inherited from [[proto-Eskimo-Aleut]]ian, but it has also taken a large number of loans from other languages, especially from Danish. Early loans from Danish have often become acculturated to the Greenlandic phonological system, for example the Greenlandic word ''palasi'' "priest" is a loan from the Danish "pr<U+00E6>st". But since Greenlandic has an enormous potential for the derivation of new words from existing roots, many modern concepts have Greenlandic names that have been invented rather than borrowed, e.g. ''qarasaasiaq'' "computer" which literally means "artificial brain". This potential for complex derivations also means that Greenlandic vocabulary is built on very few roots which combined with affixes come to form large word families.<ref name="encyc"/> For example the root for "tongue" ''oqaq'' is used to derive the following words:

*''oqarpoq'' 	        'says'
*''oqaaseq'' 	        'word'
*''oqaluppoq'' 	        'speaks'
*''oqaasilerisoq '' 	'linguist'
*''oqaasilerissutit'' 	'grammar'
*''oqaluttualiortoq'' 	'author'
*''oqaasipiluuppaa'' 	'harangues him'
*''oqaatiginerluppaa'' 	'speaks badly about him'

Often differences in vocabulary between dialects are considerable. This is due to the earlier cultural practice of imposing [[taboo]] on words which had served as names for a deceased person. Since people were often named after everyday objects, many of these have changed their name several times because of taboo rules, causing dialectal vocabulary to diverge further.<ref name="encyc"/>

==Orthography==
In contrast to most Eskimo-Aleut languages in [[Canada]], Greenlandic is written with the [[Latin alphabet]] and not with the [[Inuktitut syllabics|Inuktitut syllabary]].

From 1851 and untill 1973 Greenlandic was written in the orthography invented by [[Samuel Kleinschmidt]]. This orthography employed the special character, ''[[Kra (letter)|kra]]'' ('''{{unicode|<U+039A><U+02BB> / <U+0138>}}'''), which was replaced by [[q]] in the 1973 reform.<ref>http://www.evertype.com/alphabets/greenlandic.pdf</ref> In the Kleinschmidt orthography long vowels and geminate consonants were indicated by means of diacritics on the vowels (in the case of consonant gemination, the diacritics were placed on the vowel preceding the affected consonant).  For example, the name ''Kalaallit Nunaat'' was spelled ''Kal<U+00E2>dlit Nun<U+00E1>t''. This scheme uses an [[acute accent]] ( <U+00B4> ) to indicate vowel gemination (''i.e.'', ''<U+00E1>'', ''<U+00ED>'', ''<U+00FA>'' modern: ''aa'', ''ii'', ''uu''), a [[tilde]] ( <U+02DC> ) or a [[grave accent]] ( ` ), depending on the author, indicates gemination of the consonant following (''e.g.'', ''<U+00E3>t'', ''<U+0129>t'', ''<U+0169>t'' or ''<U+00E0>t'', ''<U+00EC>t'', ''<U+00F9>t'', modern: ''att'', ''itt'', ''utt''), while a [[circumflex accent]] ( <U+02C6> ) indicates a sequence of a geminated vowel followed by a geminated consonant (''e.g.'', ''<U+00E2>t/<U+00EE>t/<U+00FB>t'', modern: ''aatt'', ''iitt'', ''uutt''). The letters ''<U+00EA>'' and ''<U+00F4>'', used only before ''r'' and ''q'', are now written ''er/eq'' and ''or/oq'' in Greenlandic.  (The vowels ''e'' and ''o'' are position-dependent phonemic variants of ''i'' and ''u'', as described in the discussion of ''[[#Vowels|vowels]]'' above.)  The spelling system of [[Nunatsiavummiutut]], spoken in [[Nunatsiavut]] in northeastern [[Labrador]], is derived from the old Greenlandic system.

The alphabet for Greenlandic is: A E F G I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V. To spell loanwords from other languages, especially from [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[English language|English]], the additional letters ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''h'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''w'', ''<U+00E6>'', ''<U+00F8>'' and ''<U+00E5>'' are used.<ref>Gr<U+00F8>nlands sprogn<U+00E6>vn (1992)</ref><ref>(Petersen) 1990</ref> Greenlandic uses the symbols <U+203A>...<U+2039> and <U+00BB>...<U+00AB> as quotation marks.
