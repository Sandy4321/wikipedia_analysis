<!--NB<U+2014>THE DATES IN THIS ARTICLE ARE NON-AUTOFORMATTED-->'''Greater Manchester''' is a [[metropolitan county]] in [[North West England]], with a population of [[List of ceremonial counties of England|2.57&nbsp;million]]. It encompasses one of the largest [[metropolitan area]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] and comprises ten [[metropolitan borough]]s: [[Metropolitan Borough of Bolton|Bolton]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Bury|Bury]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham|Oldham]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale|Rochdale]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Stockport|Stockport]], [[Tameside]], [[Trafford]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Wigan|Wigan]], and the cities of [[Manchester]] and [[City of Salford|Salford]]. Greater Manchester was created on 1&nbsp;April 1974 as a result of the [[Local Government Act 1972]].

There is a mix of high density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester, but overwhelmingly the land use is urban.<!--REF IN MAIN BODY--> It has a focussed central business district, formed by [[Manchester city centre]] and the adjoining parts of [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] and Trafford, but Greater Manchester is also a polycentric county with ten metropolitan districts, each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs.<!--REF IN MAIN BODY--> The [[Greater Manchester Urban Area]] is the [[List of conurbations in the United Kingdom|third most populous conurbation in the UK]], and spans across most of the county's territory.

For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government; district councils shared power with the [[Greater Manchester County Council]]. The county council was abolished in 1986, and so its districts (the metropolitan boroughs) are now effectively [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority areas]]. However, the metropolitan county continues to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference,<ref name="geographic frame of reference">{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/ons_geography/Gazetteer_v3.pdf|author=[[Office for National Statistics]]|title=Gazetteer of the old and new geographies of the United Kingdom|page=48|format=PDF|publisher=statistics.gov.uk}} Retrieved on 6&nbsp;March 2008.<br /><U+2022>{{Cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/geography/metropolitan.asp |title=Beginners' Guide to UK Geography: Metropolitan Counties and Districts|author=[[Office for National Statistics]]|publisher=statistics.gov.uk|date=17&nbsp;September 2004}} Retrieved on 6&nbsp;March 2008.<br /><U+2022>{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/boundary-reviews/all-reviews/north-west|title=North West&nbsp;<U+2013> Electoral Commission|publisher=The Electoral Commission}} Retrieved on 7&nbsp;July 2008.</ref> and several county-wide services are co-ordinated through the [[Association of Greater Manchester Authorities]].

Before the creation of the metropolitan county, the name ''SELNEC'' was used for the area, taken from the initials of "South East Lancashire North East Cheshire".

{{See also|History of Manchester}}

=== Origins ===
Although the modern county of Greater Manchester was not created until 1974, the history of its constituent settlements and parts goes back centuries. There is evidence of [[Iron Age]] inhabitation, particularly at [[Mellor, Greater Manchester|Mellor]],<ref name="Mellor hill fort">Nevell and Redhead (2005), p.&nbsp;20.</ref> and [[Celtic people|Celtic activity]] in a settlement named [[Chochion]], believed to have been an area of [[Wigan]] settled by the [[Brigantes]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Roman Wigan |url=http://www.wiganarchsoc.co.uk/how.html#Roman |author=Adrian Morris |publisher=Wigan Archaeological Society}} Retrieved on 10&nbsp;July 2008.</ref> [[Stretford]] was also part of the land believed to have been occupied by the Celtic Brigantes tribe, and lay on their border with the [[Cornovii (Midlands)|Cornovii]] on the southern side of the [[River Mersey]].<ref>Bayliss (1996), p.&nbsp;6.</ref> The remains of 1st century [[castra|forts]] at [[Castlefield]] in Manchester,<ref>{{cite web |title=Mamucium Roman fort |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=76731 |publisher=Pastscape.org.uk}} Retrieved on 29&nbsp;December 2007.</ref> and [[Castleshaw Roman fort]] in [[Saddleworth]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Castle Shaw |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=45891 |publisher=Pastscape.org.uk}} Retrieved on 29&nbsp;December 2007.</ref> are evidence of [[Roman Britain|Roman occupation]]. Much of the region was omitted from the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086; Redhead states that this was because only a partial survey was taken, rather than sparsity of population.<ref>Redhead, Norman, in: Hartwell, Hyde and Pevsner (2004), p.&nbsp;18.</ref>
[[File:Weavers' cottages, Wardle.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Former [[weavers' cottage]]s in [[Wardle, Greater Manchester|Wardle]]. The development of Greater Manchester is attributed to a shared tradition of [[domestic system|domestic]] cloth production, and  [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]].]]
During the [[Middle Ages]], much of what became Greater Manchester lay within the [[Salford (hundred)|hundred of Salfordshire]]&nbsp;<U+2013> an ancient division of the county of [[Lancashire]]. Salfordshire encompassed several [[parish]]es and [[Township (England)|townships]], some of which, like [[Rochdale]], were important market towns and centres of England's woollen trade. The development of what became Greater Manchester is attributed to a shared tradition of [[domestic system|domestic]] [[flannel]] and [[fustian]] cloth production, which encouraged a system of cross-regional trade.<ref name="FrangopuloPix">Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;ix.</ref><ref>Frangopulo (1977), pp.&nbsp;24<U+2013>25.</ref><ref name="M&N">McNeil and Nevell (2000), pp.&nbsp;1<U+2013>3.</ref> The [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed the local domestic system, and much of Greater Manchester's heritage is related to [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]] and the infrastructure that grew up to support this sector.<ref name="M&N"/> The townships in and around Manchester began expanding "at an astonishing rate" around the turn of the 19th century as part of a process of unplanned [[urbanisation]] brought on by a boom in textile processing.<ref name="Cotton">Aspin (1981), p.&nbsp;3.</ref> Places such as [[Bury]], [[Oldham]] and [[Bolton]] played a central economic role in the nation, and by the end of the 19th century had become some of the most important and productive [[mill town]]s in the world.<ref>Cowhig (1976), pp.&nbsp;7<U+2013>9.</ref> However, it was Manchester that was the most populous settlement, a major city and the world's largest marketplace for cotton goods.<ref name="Kidd">Kidd (2006), pp.&nbsp;12,&nbsp;15<U+2013>24,&nbsp;224.</ref><ref name=Hall>{{cite book | last = Hall | first = Peter | title = Cities in Civilization | publisher = Weidenfeld & Nicolson | location = London | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-297-84219-6 | chapter = The first industrial city: Manchester 1760<U+2013>1830 | unused_data = ISBN status = May be invalid - please double check<U+2014>IS OK via http://www.jstor.org/pss/823133}}</ref> By 1835 "Manchester was without challenge the first and greatest industrial city in the world",<ref name=Hall/> and due to its commercial and socioeconomic success the need for local government and geo-administrative reform for the region in and around the city was proposed in as early as the 1910s.<ref name="FrangopuloP226">Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;226.</ref>

By the 18th century, traders from [[Germany]] had coined the name ''Manchesterthum'', meaning "Greater Manchester", and were using that as a name for the region in and around Manchester.<ref>Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;268.</ref> However, the English term "Greater Manchester" did not appear until the start of the 20th century. One of its first known recorded uses was in a 1914 report put forward in response to what was considered to have been the successful creation of the [[County of London]] in 1889. The report suggested that a county should be set up to recognise the "Manchester known in commerce", and referred to the areas that formed "a substantial part of South Lancashire and part of Cheshire, comprising all municipal boroughs and minor authorities within a radius of eight or nine miles of Manchester".<ref name="FrangopuloP226"/><ref>Swarbrick, J., (February 1914), ''Greater Manchester: The Future Municipal Government of Large Cities'', pp.&nbsp;12<U+2013>15.</ref> In his 1915 book ''Cities In Evolution'', innovative [[urban planning|urban planner]] [[Patrick Geddes|Sir Patrick Geddes]] wrote "far more than Lancashire realises, is growing up another Greater London".<ref>Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;229.</ref>

Most of Greater Manchester lay within the ancient county boundaries of [[Lancashire]]; those areas south of the [[River Mersey|Mersey]] and [[River Tame, Greater Manchester|Tame]] were in [[Cheshire]]. The [[Saddleworth]] area and a small part of [[Mossley]] are historically part of [[Yorkshire]] and in the south-east a small part in [[Derbyshire]]. The areas that were incorporated into Greater Manchester in 1974 previously formed parts of the [[Administrative counties of England|administrative counties]] of Cheshire, Lancashire, the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] and of eight independent [[county borough]]s.<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> By the early 1970s, this system of demarcation was described as "archaic" and "grossly inadequate to keep pace both with the impact of motor travel, and with the huge increases in local government responsibilities".<ref>{{Harvnb|Clark|1973|p=1.}}</ref>

The ''[[Manchester Evening News|Manchester Evening Chronicle]]'' brought to the fore the issue of "regional unity" for the area in April 1935 under the headline "Greater Manchester&nbsp;<U+2013> The Ratepayers' Salvation". It reported on the "increasing demands for the exploration of the possibilities of a greater merger of [[public services]] throughout Manchester and the surrounding municipalities".<ref name="FrangopuloP227">Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;227.</ref> The issue was frequently discussed by civic leaders in the area at that time, particularly those from Manchester and [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]]. The Mayor of Salford pledged his support to the idea, stating that he looked forward to the day when "there would be a merging of the essential services of Manchester, Salford, and the surrounding districts constituting Greater Manchester."<ref name="FrangopuloP227"/> Proposals were halted by the [[World War II|Second World War]], though in the decade after it, the pace of proposals for local government reform for the area quickened.<ref name="FrangopuloP228">Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;228.</ref> In 1947, [[Lancashire County Council]] proposed a three "[[Riding (division)|ridings]]" system to meet the changing needs of the county of Lancashire, including those for Manchester and surrounding districts.<ref name="FrangopuloP228"/> Other proposals included the creation of a Manchester County Council, a directly elected regional body. In 1951, the [[census in the United Kingdom|census in the UK]] began reporting on South East Lancashire as a homogeneous conurbation.<ref name="FrangopuloP228"/>

=== Redcliffe-Maud Report ===
{{Further|[[Redcliffe-Maud Report]]}}
The [[Local Government Act 1958]] designated the south east Lancashire area (which, despite its name, included part of north east Cheshire), a Special Review Area. The [[Local Government Commission for England (1958<U+2013>1967)|Local Government Commission for England]] presented draft recommendations, in December 1965, proposing a new county based on the conurbation surrounding and including Manchester, with nine most-purpose boroughs corresponding to the modern Greater Manchester boroughs (excluding Wigan). The review was abolished in favour of the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report|Royal Commission on Local Government]] before issuing a final report.<ref>Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;231.</ref>

The Royal Commission's 1969 report, known as the Redcliffe-Maud Report, proposed the removal of much of the then existing system of local government. The commission described the system of administering [[Urban district|urban]] and [[rural district]]s separately as outdated, noting that urban areas provided employment and services for rural dwellers, and open countryside was used by town dwellers for recreation. The commission considered interdependence of areas at many levels, including travel-to-work, provision of services, and which local newspapers were read, before proposing a new administrative [[metropolitan area]].<ref>Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;234.</ref> The area had roughly the same northern boundary as today's Greater Manchester (though included [[Rossendale]]), but covered much more territory from Cheshire (including [[Macclesfield]], [[Warrington]], [[Alderley Edge]], [[Northwich]], [[Middlewich]], [[Wilmslow]] and [[Lymm]]), and Derbyshire (the towns of [[New Mills]], [[Whaley Bridge]], [[Glossop]] and [[Chapel-en-le-Frith]]&nbsp;<U+2013> a minority report suggested that [[Buxton]] be included).<ref name="Redcliffe"/> The metropolitan area was to be divided into nine metropolitan districts, based on Wigan, Bolton, Bury/Rochdale, Warrington, Manchester (including Salford and Old Trafford), Oldham, Altrincham, Stockport and Tameside.<ref name="Redcliffe"/> The report noted "The choice even of a label of convenience for this metropolitan area is difficult".<ref>Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;233.</ref> Seven years earlier, a survey prepared for the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science|British Association]] intended to define the "South-East Lancashire conurbation" noted that "Greater Manchester it is not&nbsp;... One of its main characteristics is the marked individuality of its towns,&nbsp;... all of which have an industrial and commercial history of more than local significance".<ref>Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;264.</ref> The term ''Selnec'' (or ''SELNEC'') was already in use as an abbreviation for south east Lancashire and north east Cheshire; Redcliffe-Maud took this as "the most convenient term available", having modified it to south east Lancashire, north east and central Cheshire.<ref name="Redcliffe">Redcliffe-Maud ''et al.'' (June 1969), pp.&nbsp;219<U+2013>235.</ref>
Following the [[Transport Act 1968]], in 1969 the [[Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive|SELNEC Passenger Transport Executive]] (an authority to co-ordinate and operate public transport in the region) was set up, covering an area smaller than the proposed Selnec, and different again to the eventual Greater Manchester. Compared with the Redcliffe-Maud area, it excluded Macclesfield, Warrington, and Knutsford but included Glossop and [[Saddleworth]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. It excluded Wigan, which was in both the Redcliffe-Maud area and in the eventual Greater Manchester (but had not been part of the 1958 act's review area).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.selnec.org.uk/selnec.htm|publisher=selnec.org.uk|author=The SELNEC Preservation Society|title=The Formation of the SELNEC PTE}} Retrieved on 6&nbsp;July 2008.</ref>

Redcliffe-Maud's recommendations were accepted by the Labour-controlled Government in February 1970.<ref name="Redcliffe2">Redcliffe-Maud and Wood (1975), pp.&nbsp;46<U+2013>7, 56, 157.</ref>  Although the Redcliffe-Maud Report was rejected by the Conservative government after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]], there was a commitment to local government reform, and the need for a metropolitan county centred on the conurbation surrounding Manchester was accepted. The new government's original proposal was much smaller than the Redcliffe-Maud Report's Selnec, with areas such as Warrington, Winsford, Northwich, Knutsford, Macclesfield and Glossop retained by their original counties to ensure their [[county council]]s had enough revenue to remain competitive ([[Cheshire County Council]] would have ceased to exist).<ref name="Redcliffe2"/> Other late changes included the separation of the proposed Bury/Rochdale authority (retained from the Redcliffe-Maud report) into the [[Metropolitan Borough of Bury]] and the [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale]]. Bury and Rochdale were originally planned to form a single district (dubbed "Botchdale" by local MP [[Michael Fidler]])<ref>{{cite hansard|house=House of Commons|date=6 July&nbsp; 1972|column_start=763|column_end=834}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Lancashire saved from 'Botchdale'|work=[[The Times]]|date=7&nbsp;July 1972}}</ref> but were divided into separate boroughs. To re-balance the districts, the borough of Rochdale took [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]] from Oldham.<ref>{{cite news|title=Philosophy on councils has yet to emerge|work=[[The Times]]|date=8&nbsp;July 1972}}</ref>  During the passage of the bill, the towns of [[Whitworth, Lancashire|Whitworth]], Wilmslow and [[Poynton]] successfully objected to their incorporation in the new county.<ref name= "Redcliffe2"/>

The plan set out strategic and long-term objectives for the forthcoming metropolitan county.<ref>Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;246.</ref> The highest priority was to increase the quality of life for its inhabitants by way of improving the county's physical environment and cultural facilities which had suffered following [[deindustrialisation]]<U+2014>much of Greater Manchester's basic infrastructure dated from its 19th century industrial growth, and was unsuited to modern communication systems and life-styles.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bristow|Cross|1983|p=30}}.</ref> Other objectives were to reverse the trend of depopulation in central-Greater Manchester, to invest in the county's country parks to improve the region's poor reputation on leisure and recreational facilities, and to improve the county's transport infrastructure and journey to work patterns.<ref>Frangopulo (1977), pp.&nbsp;246<U+2013>255.</ref>

Because of political objection, particularly from Cheshire, Greater Manchester covered only the inner, urban 62 of the 90 former districts that the Royal Commission had outlined as an effective administrative metropolitan area.<ref name="Wannop">{{Harvnb|Wannop|2002|pp=144<U+2013>145}}.</ref> In this capacity, GMCC found itself "planning for an arbitrary metropolitan area&nbsp;... abruptly truncated to the south", and so had to negotiate several land-use, transport and housing projects with its neighbouring county councils.<ref name="Wannop"/> However a "major programme of environmental action" by GMCC broadly succeeded in reversing social deprevation in its [[inner city]] slums.<ref name="Wannop"/> Leisure and recreational successes included the Greater Manchester Exhibition Centre (better known as the G-Mex centre and now branded [[Manchester Central (Conference Centre)|Manchester Central]]), a converted former railway station in Manchester city centre used for cultural events,<ref>Parkinson-Bailey (2000), pp.&nbsp;214<U+2013>5.</ref> and GMCC's creation of five new [[country park]]s within its boundaries.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|Evans|Fraser|1996|p=76}}.</ref>

Unlike most other modern counties (including [[Merseyside]] and [[Tyne and Wear]]), Greater Manchester was never adopted as a [[Postal counties of the United Kingdom|postal county]] by the [[Royal Mail]]. A review in 1973 noted that "Greater Manchester" would be unlikely to be adopted because of confusion with the [[M postcode area|Manchester post town]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Changes in local government units may cause some famous names to disappear|work=[[The Times]]|date=2&nbsp;January 1973}}<br /><U+2022>{{cite news|title=Post Office will ignore some new counties over addresses|work=[[The Times]]|date=26&nbsp;November 1973}}</ref> And so the component areas of Greater Manchester held on to their pre-1974 postal counties until 1996, when they were abolished.<ref name=guide>{{cite book|publisher=[[Royal Mail]]|title=Address Management Guide|year=2004}}</ref>

A decade after they were established, the mostly [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]-controlled metropolitan county councils and the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) had several high profile clashes with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]], with regards overspending and high [[rates (tax)|rates]] charging. Government policy on the issue was considered throughout 1982, and the Conservative Party put a "promise to scrap the metropolitan county councils" and the GLC, in their manifesto for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]].<ref name="UK61">{{Harvnb|Wilson|Game|2002|p=61}}.</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Tory plan to abolish GLC and metropolitan councils, but rates stay|author=Walker, David|work=[[The Times]]|date=15&nbsp;January 1983}}<br /><U+2022>{{cite news|title=Tories may abolish county councils if they win election|author=Haviland, Julian|work=[[The Times]]|date=5&nbsp;May 1983}}<br /><U+2022>{{cite news|title=Big cities defiant over police|author=Tendler, Stewart|work=[[The Times]]|date=16&nbsp;June 1983}}</ref> Greater Manchester County Council was abolished on 31&nbsp;March 1986 under the [[Local Government Act 1985]].

Greater Manchester is a landlocked county spanning [[List of ceremonial counties of England by area|492.7&nbsp;square miles (1,276&nbsp;km<U+00B2>)]]. The [[Pennines]] rise along the eastern side of the county, through parts of [[Oldham]], [[Rochdale]] and [[Tameside]]. The [[West Pennine Moors]], as well as a number of coalfields (mainly sandstones and shales) lie in the west of the county. The rivers [[River Mersey|Mersey]] and [[River Tame, Greater Manchester|Tame]] run through the county boundaries, both of which rise in the Pennines. Other rivers run through the county, including the [[River Beal|Beal]], the [[River Douglas|Douglas]] and the [[River Irk|Irk]].

There is a mix of high density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester, but overwhelmingly the land use in the county is urban.<ref name="GMLTP">{{cite web|url=http://www.gmltp.co.uk/gmltp2_html/section_123173639918.html |title=The Greater Manchester Area and its Regional Context |author=[[GMPTE|Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority]] |publisher=gmltp.co.uk}} Retrieved on 11&nbsp;April 2007.</ref> It has a strong regional central business district, formed by [[Manchester city centre]] and the adjoining parts of [[City of Salford|Salford]] and [[Trafford]].

Greater Manchester is arguably the most complex urban area in the UK outside London,<ref name="GMLTP"/> and this is reflected in the density of its transport network and the scale of its needs for investment to meet the growing and diverse movement demands generated by its development pattern.

The [[Greater Manchester Urban Area]] is an area of land defined by the [[Office for National Statistics]] consisting of the large conurbation surrounding and including the City of Manchester. Its territory spans much, but not all of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. It excludes settlements such as [[Wigan]] and [[Marple, Greater Manchester|Marple]] from within the Greater Manchester county boundaries, but includes some settlements which are outside of the county boundaries, such as [[Wilmslow]] and [[Alderley Edge]] in [[Cheshire]], and [[Whitworth, Lancashire|Whitworth]] in [[Lancashire]]. Although neither the Greater Manchester county, nor the [[Greater Manchester Urban Area]] have been granted [[city status in the United Kingdom]], [[European Union]] literature suggests that the conurbation surrounding Manchester constitutes a homogonous urban [[city region]].<ref>[http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/strongprosperous State of the English Cities: Volume 1] Produced for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, (2006).

[[Local government in England|Local governance]] in Greater Manchester is currently provided by the councils of ten [[Districts of England|districts]], known as [[metropolitan borough]]s, these are: [[Metropolitan Borough of Bolton|Bolton]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Bury|Bury]], the [[Manchester|City of Manchester]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham|Oldham]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale|Rochdale]], the [[City of Salford]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Stockport|Stockport]], [[Tameside]], [[Trafford]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Wigan|Wigan]].

Eight of the ten metropolitan boroughs of Greater Manchester are named after the eight former county boroughs that now compose the largest centres of population and greater historical and political prominence.<ref name="FrangopuloP138">Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;138.</ref> As an example, the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport is centred on the town of [[Stockport]], a former county borough, but includes other smaller settlements, such as [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]], [[Gatley]], and [[Bramhall]].<ref name="FrangopuloP138"/> The names of two of the metropolitan boroughs were given a neutral name because, at the time they were created, there was no agreement on the town to be put forward as the administrative centre and neither had a [[county borough]]. These boroughs are [[Tameside]] and [[Trafford]], centred on [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] and [[Stretford]], respectively, and are named with reference to geographical and historical origins.<ref name="FrangopuloP138"/>

For the first 12&nbsp;years after the county was created in 1974, the county had a two-tier system of [[local government in England|local government]], and the metropolitan borough councils shared power with the [[Greater Manchester County Council]].<ref name="politics">{{cite journal | title= Greater Manchester: conurbation complexity and local government structure | author= Barlow, Max | journal= Political Geography | volume= 14 | year= 1995 | pages= 379<U+2013>400 | issue= 4| doi= 10.1016/0962-6298(95)95720-I | ref= harv}}</ref> The Greater Manchester County Council, a strategic authority running regional services such as transport, strategic planning, emergency services and waste disposal, comprised 106 members drawn from the ten [[metropolitan borough]]s of Greater Manchester.<ref>Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council (N.D.), p.&nbsp;65.</ref> However in 1986, along with the five other [[metropolitan county]] councils and the [[Greater London Council]], the Greater Manchester County Council was abolished, and most of its powers were devolved to the boroughs.<ref name="politics"/> Various [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]]es exist in certain parts of Greater Manchester.

Although the [[county council]], which was based in what is now Westminster House off [[Piccadilly Gardens]], has been abolished, a number of local government functions take place at the county level. That eight of the ten borough councils have (for the most part) been [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]-controlled since 1986, has helped maintain informal co-operation between the districts at a county-level.<ref name="Wannop">{{Harvnb|Wannop|2002|p=148}}.</ref> However, the ten authorities of Greater Manchester co-operate formally through the [[Association of Greater Manchester Authorities]] (AGMA), which meets to create a co-ordinated county-wide approach to many issues.

These joint boards are made up of councillors appointed from each of the ten boroughs (except the Waste Disposal Authority, which does not include the [[Metropolitan Borough of Wigan]]). The ten boroughs jointly own the [[Manchester Airport Group]] which controls [[Manchester Airport]] and three other UK airports. Other services are directly funded and managed by the local councils.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Greater Manchester&nbsp;<U+2013> 'up and going'?  |author=Hebbert, Michael|coauthors=Iain Deas |journal=Policy & Politics |volume=28 |year=2000 |pages= 79<U+2013>92 |issue=1 |issn=0305 5736 |ref=harv}}</ref>

Greater Manchester is a [[ceremonial county]] with its own [[Lord-Lieutenant]] who is the personal representative of the monarch. The Local Government Act 1972 provided that the whole of the area to be covered by the new metropolitan county of Greater Manchester would also be included in the [[Duchy of Lancaster]]&nbsp;<U+2013> extending the duchy to include areas which were formerly in the counties of Cheshire and the West Riding of Yorkshire.

<!-- too much 'racing'-->Horse racing has taken place at several sites in the county. The two biggest courses were both known as [[Manchester Racecourse]]&nbsp;<U+2013> though neither was within the boundaries of Manchester&nbsp;<U+2013> and ran from the 17th century until 1963. Racing was at [[Kersal Moor]] until 1847 when the racecourse at [[Castle Irwell]] was opened. In 1867 racing was moved to New Barnes, [[Weaste]], until the site was vacated (for a hefty price) in 1901 to allow an expansion to [[Salford Docks|Manchester Docks]]. The land is now home to Dock 9 of the re-branded [[Salford Quays]]. Racing then moved back to Castle Irwell which later staged a [[British Classic Races|Classic]]&nbsp;<U+2013> the 1941 [[St. Leger Stakes|St. Leger]]&nbsp;<U+2013> and was home to the [[Lancashire Oaks]] (nowadays run at [[Haydock Park Racecourse|Haydock Park]]) and the [[November Handicap]], which was traditionally the last major race of the flat season.
