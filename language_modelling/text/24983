Kjerringberget is a [[hill]] located in [[Trondheim]], [[Lade]] in central [[Norway]]. The small mountain is about 45 meters over the ocean. [[Ladestien]], which goes from Ladehammeren to Rotvoll, goes over Kjerringberget. The top of Kjerringberget provides a view over Trondheim West, [[Munkholmen]], [[Trondheimsfjorden]] and [[Fosen]].

Kjerringberget is made of green stone. These stones were made originally by subterranean lava flow from an ocean that no longer exists. When the lava got in contact with water it became stone. After a while new stone types got mixed with the stone trondhjemitt, as indicated by the mountain's cushion structure and irregular pattern. [[Bymarka]] and [[Vassfjellet]] in Trondheim also have these structures. 

Kjerringberget also has some connections to the [[second world war]]. Stone from Kjerringberget was used to build a [[Mole_(architecture)|mole]] in Korsvika. The mole was never finished because the war ended prior to its completion.
