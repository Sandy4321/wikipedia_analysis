'''McGill University''' is a publicly funded, co-educational research university located in the city of [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. McGill's main campus is set upon 32 hectares (80 acres) at the foot of [[Mount Royal]] in Montreal's downtown district. A second campus&mdash;[[Macdonald Campus]]&mdash;is situated on 650 hectares (1,600 acres) of fields and forested land in [[Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec|Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue]], 32 km (20 miles) west of the downtown campus. McGill has 21 faculties and professional schools and offers degrees and diplomas in over 300 fields of study. The university also has field research stations in [[Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Quebec|Mont-Saint-Hilaire]] and [[Schefferville, Quebec]]; [[Axel Heiberg Island]] in [[Nunavut]]; and [[Holetown]], [[Barbados]].

McGill was founded in 1821 from a bequest by [[James McGill]], a prominent Montreal merchant, who left an endowment in addition to the property on which the university now stands. McGill would become the first non-denominational university in the [[British Empire]].

The university ranked first among Canadian medical-doctoral universities in ''[[Maclean's]]'' 2006 University Rankings issue for the second year in a row,<ref>{{cite web | title = McGill ranked at the top of the class by Maclean's; Again this year, McGill earns first place among medical-doctoral universities | publisher = Canada Newswire | date = [[November 2]], [[2006]] | work = Lexis Nexis | url = http://alacarte.lexisnexis.com/partners/int/google/landingpage.asp?id=26736463&mtid=1&ws=9j0hDk1UboE=&ws_pub=Canada%20NewsWire&ws_date=November%202,%202006&ws_len=529&ws_lni=4M82-2B50-TX2X-031P-00000-00&ws_lastupdate=20061102&ws_title=McGill%20ranked%20at%20the%20top&ws_refer=http://news.google.com/archivesearch?client=safari&rls=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=Maclean's+University+Rankings+McGill&as_ldate=2006&as_hdate=2006&um=1&scoring=t&sa=X&oi=archive&ct=title | accessdate = 2007-03-21}}</ref> and is among the top 25 universities in the world according to the 2006 ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Top 200: World University Rankings | publisher = The Times Higher | work = Parked.net | url = http://www.paked.net/higher_education/rankings/times_rankings.htm }}</ref>  McGill and its affiliated hospitals were awarded $423 million in research funding in 2004-05.<ref>[http://www.mcgill.ca/about/quickfacts/research/ Research], McGill Quick Facts</ref>

McGill's [[Redpath Museum]], commissioned in 1880 and opened in 1882, is the oldest building built specifically as a [[museum]] in [[North America]]. Its natural history collections boast material collected by the same individuals who founded the collections of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] and the [[Smithsonian]].

== History ==
=== The Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning ===
[[Image:James McGill.JPG|left|140px|thumb|[[James McGill]], the original benefactor of McGill University]]

The '''Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning''' (R.I.A.L.), McGill's predecessor institution, was created in 1801 by an Act of the [[Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada]], which called for the "Establishment of Free Schools and the advancement of Learning in this Province."<ref name=charter>''[http://www.mcgill.ca/secretariat/charter-statutes/royal/ The Royal Charter of McGill University], accessed January 21, 2006.</ref> The institution's initial purpose was to administer the provision of [[elementary education]] in Quebec, but the R.I.A.L. spent most of its early years trying to get funds from the government to enable it to establish and operate these schools, which were primarily for the Protestant English-speaking inhabitants of [[Lower Canada]] (now largely comprising modern-day Quebec). The R.I.A.L. was the first institution in Canada to receive [[List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage|royal patronage]].

In 1811, [[James McGill]], a [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrant and successful English- and French-speaking merchant, drew up a will leaving a 19 hectare (46 acre) tract of land&mdash;his estate, which he called ''Burnside''&mdash;in what was then rural land. In addition, he bequeathed the sum of 10,000 pounds to the R.I.A.L. As a condition of the bequest, the land and funds would have to be used for the establishment of a "University or College, for the purposes of Education and the Advancement of Learning in the said Province."<ref name=charter/> When he died in December 1813, this task became the responsibility of the R.I.A.L. The will specified that, if a college was not established within 10 years of his death, the estate and the money would revert to the heirs of his wife, Charlotte Desrivieres. As an added condition, the new institution would be required to bear his name.

In 1821, after protracted legal battles with the Desrivieres family, '''McGill College''' received a [[Royal Charter]] from [[King George IV]], establishing it as a university. In fact, due to the lawsuits&mdash;which did not finally end until 1835&mdash;and because the college had little money (the government was not funding the institution at the time), classes were not held until 1829, when McGill College was officially inaugurated. That same year, the Montreal Medical Institution became the college's Faculty of Medicine, which would be the school's first academic unit. This remained the college's only functioning faculty until 1843 when the Faculty of Arts commenced teaching in the newly constructed Arts Building and East Wing (Dawson Hall).

In due course, the R.I.A.L. lost control of the 84 grammar schools it had administered. At that point, its sole purpose was to administer the McGill bequests on behalf of the college. The Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning continues to exist and is the "legal person" that runs the university and its various constituent bodies, including the former Macdonald College (now Macdonald Campus), Royal Victoria College (the former women's college turned residence) and the Montreal Neurological Institute. The Institution's name appears on all cheques cut by the university. The Trustees of the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning comprise, since the revised Royal Charter of 1852, the Board of Governors of McGill University.<ref>Frost, Stanley Brice.

=== Early years ===
[[Image:Mcgill University Arts Building.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Arts Building, built in 1843 by John Ostell, is the oldest building on campus.]]

The first classes were held in Burnside Place, James McGill's country home, until the 1840s when the university began construction on its first buildings, the central and east wings of the Arts Building.<ref>[http://cac.mcgill.ca/campus/evolution.html The Early Campus], Virtual McGill.</ref>  However, the rest of the campus was essentially a cow pasture.  [[John William Dawson|Sir John William Dawson]], McGill's fifth president (from 1855 to 1893) is often credited with transforming the school into a modern university.<ref>[http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/history/]</ref>  He recruited the aid of Montreal's wealthiest citizens, many of whom donated the property and funding needed to construct the campus' buildings.  Their names adorn many of the campus's prominent buildings including the [[Redpath Museum]] (1880), Macdonald Physics Building (1893), the Redpath Library (1893), the Macdonald Chemistry Building (1896), the Macdonald Engineering Building (1907), and the Strathcona Medical Building (1907 - now the Strathcona Anatomy and Dentistry Building).  This expansion of the campus continued through to 1920.  In 1885, the university's Board of Governors formally adopted the use of the name McGill University.

Women's education at McGill began in 1884 when Donald Smith, also known as [[Lord Strathcona]], began funding separate lectures for women, given by university staff members.  The first degrees granted to women at McGill were conferred in 1888.<ref>[http://www.ccheritage.ca/biographies/williamdawson.php William Dawson], CCHeritage.</ref>  Later, in 1899, the Royal Victoria College (RVC) opened as a residential college for women at McGill.  Until the 1970s, all female undergraduate students, known as "Donaldas," were considered to be members of RVC.<ref>[http://www.archives.mcgill.ca/public/hist_mcgill/rvc/rvc.htm Royal Victoria College], McGill University Archives.</ref>  Today, the College is an all-women's dormitory forming part of the university's residence system.

In 1905, the university acquired a second campus when [[William Christopher Macdonald|Sir William C. Macdonald]], one of the university's major benefactors, endowed a college in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, 32 kilometres west of Montreal. [[Macdonald Campus|Macdonald College]], now known as the Macdonald Campus, opened to students in 1907, originally offering programs in agriculture, household science, and teaching.

McGill established the first post-secondary institutions in [[British Columbia]], to provide degree programs to the growing cities of [[Vancouver]] and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]. It created [[Victoria College, British Columbia|Victoria College]] in 1903, a two-year college offering first- and second-year McGill courses in arts and science, which was the predecessor institution to the modern [[University of Victoria]]. The province's first university was incorporated in Vancouver in 1908 as the McGill University College of British Columbia. The private institution granted McGill degrees until it became the independent [[University of British Columbia]] in 1915.<ref>[http://www.library.ubc.ca/archives/mucbc.html Higher Education in British Columbia Before the Establishment of UBC], UBC Archives.</ref>

The ''[[McGill Daily]]'' was first published in 1911.

=== McGill fran<U+00E7>ais movement ===

[[Image:McGill_University_Building3.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The [[William Christopher Macdonald|Macdonald]]-Harrington Building, home to the School of Architecture]]

The 1960s represented an era of large nationalist and labour mobilizations in Quebec.  At the time, English was seen as the privileged language of commerce, and McGill, with [[francophone]]s comprising only three percent of the student population, was seen by some as a bastion of [[anglophone]] privilege in a predominantly French-speaking city.<ref>[http://www.reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r3114/francais.html]</ref><ref>[http://www.reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r3111/scope.html]</ref> In addition, there was only one French-language university in Montreal at the time: the [[Universit<U+00E9> de Montr<U+00E9>al]]. McGill was largely out of reach to the 10,000 francophone graduates of the newly-created [[CEGEP]] system who had nowhere else to go, locally, to continue their studies.

The ''McGill fran<U+00E7>ais'' movement began in 1969, clamouring for a new McGill that would be francophone, pro-nationalist, and pro-worker. The movement was led by Stanley Gray, a political science professor from [[Ontario]].  It was argued that, since McGill received the lion's share of government funding, paid by a taxpayer base that was largely francophone, the university should equally be accessible to that segment of the population. Gray led a demonstration of 10,000 trade unionists, leftist activists, CEGEP students, and even some McGill students, at the university's Roddick Gates on March 28, 1969, with protesters shouting ''McGill fran<U+00E7>ais'', ''McGill aux Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois'', and ''McGill aux travailleurs'' (McGill for workers). Of course, the majority of students and faculty opposed such a position, and many of the protesters were arrested.<ref>Chester, Bronwyn. [http://www.reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r3114/francais.html "McGill fran<U+00E7>ais and Quebec society"]. ''McGill Reporter'', April 8, 1999. Accessed on January 20, 2006.</ref><ref>Provart, John. ''[http://www.news-archive.mcgill.ca/s99/demoen.htm McGill fran<U+00E7>ais 30 years later]''. McGill News, Summer 1999.</ref>

McGill never became a francophone or bilingual university. However, francophones now make up approximately 20 percent of the student body, a goal set by the administration in the wake of the movement.<ref>[http://www.mcgill.ca/facts2004-05/students/ McGill Facts 2004-2005]</ref>

== Language of instruction ==

McGill is one of three English-language universities in Quebec (the others being [[Concordia University]], also in Montr<U+00E9>al, and [[Bishop's University]] in [[Lennoxville]]); fluency in French is not a requirement to attend.  The Faculty of Law does, however, require all students to be "passively bilingual," meaning that all students must be able to read and understand spoken French, or English if the student is Francophone, since English or French may be used at any time in a course.  Since 1964, students in all faculties have been able to write exams and papers in either English or French, provided that the objective of the class is not to learn a particular language.<ref>[http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-0-10-1249-6929-10/index_souvenirs/vie_societe/mcgill_francais]</ref>

== Academic profile ==
[[Image:McGill_University_Building2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|688 Sherbrooke Street West, a high-rise office building, is situated directly across from the main campus. It houses many of the university's continuing education and language classes.]]

McGill's student population includes 23,559 [[undergraduate]] and 7,375 [[graduate student]]s in over 340 academic programs in eleven faculties (as of 2006-2007). Its students represent a diverse geographic and linguistic background. 46.1% of undergraduates are from Quebec, while 31.8% come from the rest of Canada and 22.0% come from abroad. 53.8% of students speak English as their mother tongue, while 19.6% speak French and 26.6% speak a first language other than English or French. About 90% of students ranked in the top 10% of their high school graduating class.<ref>[http://www.mcgill.ca/arr/registration-statistics/ McGill Enrolment reports ]</ref>

McGill has produced 128 [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]], more than any other Canadian university.<ref>[http://www.mcgill.ca/about/intro/]</ref> It has also produced six [[Nobel Laureate]]s.

Nearly 30% of undergraduate students are enrolled in the [[McGill University Faculty of Arts|Faculty of Arts]], McGill's largest academic unit. Of the remaining faculties, the Centre for Continuing Education enrolls 18%, the [[McGill University Faculty of Science|Faculty of Science]] enrolls 16%, and the [[McGill University Faculty of Engineering|Faculty of Engineering]] enrolls 10%. The remainder of undergraduate students are enrolled in McGill's smaller schools, including the [[McGill University Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences|Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences]], [[McGill University Faculty of Dentistry|Faculty of Dentistry]], [[McGill University Faculty of Education|Faculty of Education]], [[McGill University Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]], [[Desautels Faculty of Management]], [[McGill University Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine]], [[Schulich School of Music]], and the [[McGill University Faculty of Religious Studies|Faculty of Religious Studies]].

Comprising  20% of the university's student body, international students are a significant presence on the McGill campus.  The majority of McGill's international students are from the United States, making up 33% of all foreign students and 53% of all undergraduate international students.  A growing number of American students are attending McGill, with such students representing 8.7% of all undergraduates and 6.1% of all students at the university. Many are attracted to the culture and dynamism of Montreal, the university's reputation, and the relatively low tuition in comparison to many top public and private universities in the United States.<ref>Bauer, Andrew.

''McGill Tribune'', October 26, 2004.</ref> However, this trend is being repeated at many other Canadian universities, particularly those close to the Canada/U.S. border.

Since 1996, McGill, in accordance with the Minist<U+00E8>re de l'<U+00C9>ducation, du Loisir et du Sport (MELS), has had eight categories qualifying certain international students an exemption from paying international fees.  These categories include students from France, a quota of students from select countries which have agreements with MELS (including Algeria, China, and Morocco)<ref>[http://www.mels.gouv.qc.ca/ens-sup/ens-univ/droits_scolarite-A_pays-organisations.pdf Countries and International Organizations Granted Exemptions from the Additional Financial Contribution by the Government of Quebec], Minist<U+00E8>re de l'<U+00C9>ducation, du Loisir et du Sport.</ref>, students holding diplomatic status (and their dependants), and students enrolled in certain language programs leading to a degree in French.<ref>[http://www.mcgill.ca/student-records/fees/exemption/ International Fee Exemption]</ref>
[[Image:McGill_Macdonald_Engineering_Building.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Macdonald Engineering Building is adjacent to the Milton Street Gates, the campus's eastern entrance.]]

There are nearly 1,500 [[tenure|tenured]] or tenure-track professors, plus another 4,300 adjunct and visiting professors teaching at the university. McGill consistently leads the rest of Canada in terms of research dollars per full-time faculty member and number of refereed publications per full-time faculty member. According to a study by Research Infosource, research funding represents approximately $286,600 per faculty member, the third highest in the country. McGill also has one of the most per faculty research dollars nationwide from federal and provincial sources of funding (including the Canada Foundation for Innovation and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council).<ref>[http://www.researchinfosource.com/top50.shtml Research Infosource]</ref> McGill professors have won 26 [[Prix du Qu<U+00E9>bec]], 14 Prix de l'Association francophone pour le savoir and 13 Killam Prizes.

McGill University is Canada's top-ranked medical-doctoral university, scoring the highest marks in the country for a second consecutive year in the ''[[Maclean's]]'' 16th annual University Rankings issue. Last year, McGill tied for the number-one spot with the [[University of Toronto]], but occupies the top position alone this year ahead of [[Queen's University]] in second and University of Toronto in third.<ref>[http://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/news/?ItemID=22555]</ref> McGill ranked 21st worldwide (first in Canada and 12th in North America, ahead of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], and [[New York University]]) in the 2006 ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]'', making it the only Canadian university to rank in the top 25 universities in the world.<ref>[http://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/news/?ItemID=22166]</ref> [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]], in its [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]], ranked McGill 62nd in the world and third amongst Canadian universities.<ref>Institute of Higher Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14321230/site/newsweek/ Top 100 Universities]</ref>

McGill is a member of the [[Association of American Universities]] (AAU), an organization of research-intensive universities in North America. It is also a member of [[Universitas 21]], an international association of research-driven universities. In addition, it is a member of the [[G10 (Canadian universities)|G13]], a group of prominent research universities in Canada.

== Research ==
McGill is ranked third in Canada in research-intensity and total-research funding<ref>http://www.researchinfosource.com/top50.shtml</ref>, and is recognized as one of the top research universities in Canada and was named "Research University of the Year" by Research Infosource in its 2003 and 2005 ranking of "Canada's Top 50 Research Universities."<ref>Zeindler, Christine. [http://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/38/05/times/ "McGill is research university of the year, tops in Times"]. ''McGill Reporter'', October 27, 2005.</ref> Researchers and scientists at the university are affiliated with nearly 100 research centres and networks.

The university is perhaps best recognized for its research and discoveries in the health sciences. [[William Osler]], [[Wilder Penfield]], [[Donald Olding Hebb|Donald Hebb]], [[Brenda Milner]], and others made significant discoveries in [[medicine]], [[neuroscience]] and [[psychology]] while at McGill. The invention of the world's first artificial cell was made by an undergraduate student at the university.

While he was chair of physics at McGill, nuclear physicist [[Ernest Rutherford]] performed the experiment that led to the discovery of the alpha particle and its function in radioactive decay, which won him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1908.

In terms of contributions to computing, [[MUSIC/SP]], a piece of software for mainframes once popular among universities and colleges around the world at its time, was developed at McGill. A team also contributed to the development of [[Archie search engine|Archie]], one of the pre-WWW search engines. A 3270 terminal emulator developed at McGill was commercialized and later sold to Hummingbird Software.

McGill's [[Bellairs Research Institute]], in Barbados, serves as Canada's only teaching and research facility in the tropics. These facilities are used by the [[Canadian Space Agency]] for research.

== Campus ==
[[Image:McGill_Campus_Twilight.jpg|right|600px|thumb|McGill's downtown campus at night viewed from [[Mount Royal]]. The circular building in the foreground is the McIntyre Medical Sciences Building.]]

The main campus is situated in downtown Montr<U+00E9>al at the foot of [[Mount Royal]]. Most of the buildings are situated in a park-like campus north of Sherbrooke Street and south of Avenue des Pins between Peel and Aylmer streets. North of Docteur-Penfield, it also extends west of Peel for several blocks. The campus is near the [[Peel (Montreal Metro)|Peel]] and [[McGill (Montreal Metro)|McGill]] [[Montreal Metro|metro]] stations.

The downtown campus reflects an eclectic mix of old and new buildings, reflecting the various periods in which the buildings were erected and a variety of architectural styles. All of the major university buildings were constructed using local grey limestone, which serves as a unifying element.

The university's athletic facilities, including Molson Stadium, are located on Mount Royal, near the residence halls and the Montreal Neurological Institute.
[[Image:McGill_University_Building4.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The Birks Building, located on University Street.]]
A second campus, the [[Macdonald College|Macdonald Campus]], in [[Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec|Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue]] houses the Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Science, the School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition, the Institute of Parasitology and the McGill School of Environment.  The [[Morgan Arboretum]] and the [[J.S. Marshall Radar Observatory]] are nearby.

There are plans to consolidate the various hospitals of the [[McGill University Health Centre]] on the site of an old [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP]] railyard adjacent to the [[Vend<U+00F4>me (Montreal Metro)|Vend<U+00F4>me]] [[Montreal Metro|metro]] station.  This site, known as Glen Yards, comprises 17 hectares (43 acres) and spans portions of Montreal's [[Notre-Dame-de-Gr<U+00E2>ce]] neighborhood and the city of [[Westmount, Quebec|Westmount]].<ref>''[http://www.muhc.ca/media/ensemble/2001july/land/ This Land Was Made for You and Me...]'', McGill University Health Centre Journal, July/August 2001.</ref>  The Glen Yards project has been fraught with controversy due to local opposition to the project, environmental issues, and the cost of the project itself.<ref>McCabe, Daniel. ''[http://www.reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r3105/muhc.html MUHC site chosen]'', McGill Reporter, November 5, 1998.</ref>  The project, which has received approval from the provincial government, is expected to be complete by 2010.<ref>Reynolds, Mark.

== Student life ==
=== Residential life ===

[[image:McgillMCTAVISHbroulliard.jpg|thumb|260px|right|McTavish Street on a foggy day, looking towards Mount Royal. The street is the formal western boundary of the downtown campus (although some McGill buildings are located west of McTavish).]]

Unlike other large schools, most McGill students do not live in residence (known colloquially as "rez") after their first year of study, even if they are not from the Montreal area. This is due to the fact that McGill's residence system is relatively small for a school of its size, housing approximately 2,400 undergraduate students and a handful of graduate students.<ref>[http://www.mcgill.ca/residences/ McGill Residences]</ref> With the exception of upper year students returning as "floor fellows," the majority of McGill residences are for first-year undergraduate students only. Upper-year students are expected to find off-campus housing.

Residences at McGill come in a variety of forms. Most first-years live in ''Upper Rez'', a series of dormitories on the slope of Mount Royal, consisting of Douglas Hall, [[McConnell Hall]], Molson Hall and Gardner Hall. ''Royal Victoria College'', once a women's college affiliated with McGill, is a dormitory for women and is the closest to campus. McGill's newest residence, aptly named ''New Residence Hall'', was converted from a four-star hotel and is perhaps the most luxurious of the residences at McGill. ''Solin Hall'', an apartment-style residence four [[Montreal Metro|metro]] stops from campus, is the farthest from campus. The university also maintains apartment style housing around campus.
[[Image:Roddick Gates (McGill University) 2005-09-02.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Roddick Gates, the university's "main entrance" from Sherbrooke Street. The gates were erected in 1925 in memory of Sir Thomas Roddick, former Dean of the Faculty of Medicine. Roddick lobbied for the creation of the Medical Council of Canada which established common standards for medical practice in Canada. Burnside Hall, the tower in the background, houses a number of science departments.]]

Second-year students are expected to transition to off-campus apartment housing, and apartment hunting is sometimes seen as a "rite of passage" for McGill students. In recent years, finding affordable housing has been challenging because of the city's tight housing market, particularly in neighbourhoods close to the McGill campus. Many students end up living in the "[[McGill Ghetto]]," the neighbourhood directly to the east of campus, although students have, in recent years, begun moving out to other areas because of rising rent prices in the "Ghetto."

=== Activities ===

There are hundreds of clubs and student organizations at the university. Many of them are centred around McGill's student union building&mdash;the University Centre&mdash;known unofficially as the Shatner Building. In 1992, students held a [[referendum]] and named the building after actor and McGill alumnus [[William Shatner]], although the university administration refuses to accept the name. Traditionally, the administration names buildings in honour of deceased members of the university community or for major benefactors (of which Shatner is neither).<ref>Stojsic, Leslie. [http://www.reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r3112/shatner.html "The trek back home"]. ''McGill Reporter'', March 11, 1999.</ref><ref>[http://www.ssmu.ca/en/rteHistoryoftheSSMU.ch2 History of the SSMU]</ref>

McGill has two English-language student-run newspapers: the ''[[McGill Daily]]'', which is a financially independent publication, and the ''[[McGill Tribune]]'', which is published through the [[Students' Society of McGill University]]. The ''[[D<U+00E9>lit fran<U+00E7>ais]]'' is the Daily's French-language counterpart. [[CKUT]] (90.3 FM) is the campus radio station.

The university is represented in [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] by the [[McGill Redmen]] (men's) and the [[McGill Martlets]] (women's).

McGill maintains a [[McGill-Queen's rivalry|friendly rivalry]] with [[Queen's University]] in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Ontario]]. Animosity between rowing athletes at the two schools has inspired an annual boat race between the two universities in the spring of each year since 1997. This academic and athletic rivalry, which was once very intense, waned after Queen's pulled their football team out of the Ontario-Quebec Intercollegiate Football Conference in 2000 but the intensity returned in 2002 and transferred to the annual home-and-home varsity hockey games between the two institutions. Nevertheless, the two share a successful publishing house ([[McGill-Queen's University Press]]). The school also competes in the annual "[[Old Four]]" soccer tournament, with Queen's, the [[University of Toronto]] and the [[University of Western Ontario]].

The inventions of North American [[Gridiron football|football]], [[ice hockey|hockey]], and [[basketball]] are all related to McGill in some way. The first game of North American football was played between McGill and [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1874. The world's first organized hockey club (known as the Redmen since 1927), played their first game on January 31, 1877. McGill alumnus [[James Naismith]] invented basketball in early December of 1891.<ref>[http://www.mcgill.ca/prospective/viewbook/athletics/ Athletics], ''Viewbook 2005-2006''.</ref>

There has been a McGill alumnus or alumna competing at virtually every [[Olympic Games]] since 1912. Gold medallists include swimmer [[George Hodgson]]&mdash;winner of two gold medals&mdash;at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]], ice hockey goaltender [[Kim St-Pierre]]&mdash; also a winner of two gold medals&mdash;at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], and at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]], where recently, [[Jennifer Heil]] (a current student) was a gold medallist in the women's freestyle mogul event and goaltender [[Charline Labont<U+00E9>]] (also a current student) helped Canada win gold in women's ice hockey.

McGill's Redmen football program was rocked by a [[hazing]] scandal in 2005 forcing the cancellation of the final two games of the season by school officials. A formal investigation into the hazing scandals showed that "the event did involve nudity, degrading positions and behaviours, gagging, touching in inappropriate manners with a broomstick, as well as verbal and physical intimidation of rookies by a large portion of the team."<ref>"McGill University cancels football season", McGill University Press Release, October 19, 2005. Available online at http://www.football.mcgill.ca/mediaroom/2005/10_19_2005.php</ref> Dubbed 'Hazegate' by the local ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'', the scandal made national news. In 2006, McGill's Senate approved a proposed anti-hazing policy to define forbidden initiation practices.<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070111.HAZING11/TPStory/?query=mcgill McGill get tough with hazing].

== Symbols ==
The university's symbol is the [[martlet]], stemming from the presence of the mythical bird on the official Arms of the university. Inscribed on its arms is also ''In Domino Confido'' (I trust in the Lord), James McGill's personal motto.

The University's patent of arms was granted by England's Garter-King-at-Arms in 1922 and registered in 1956 with Lord Lyon King of Arms in Edinburgh and in 1992 with the Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada. In [[heraldic]] terms, the arms are described as follows:
<blockquote>''Argent three Martlets Gules, on a chief dancette of the second, an open book proper garnished or bearing the legend In Domino Confido in letters Sable between two crowns of the first. Motto: Grandescunt Aucta Labore.''</blockquote>

The school song is entitled "Hail, Alma Mater." The lyrics to the song are:

<blockquote>Hail, Alma Mater, we sing to thy praise;<br>
Loud in thy Honour, our voices we raise.<br>
Full to thy fortune, our glasses we fill.<br>
Life and Prosperity, Dear Old McGill.<br>
<br>
Hail, Alma Mater, thy praises we sing:<br>
Far down the centuries, still may they ring.<br>
Long through the ages remain &mdash; if God will,<br>
Queen of the Colleges, Dear Old McGill.</blockquote>

An audio recording of "Hail, Alma Mater," as well as other [http://www.archives.mcgill.ca/public/hist_mcgill/songs/songs.htm[McGill University songs]], is available on the McGill University Archives website.

McGill's motto is ''Grandescunt Aucta Labore'', [[Latin language|Latin]] for "by work, all things grow."  Its official colours are red and white.

== Notable alumni and faculty ==
