'''Stanley George "Frenchy" Bordagaray''' (January 3, 1910&nbsp;<U+2013> April 13, 2000) was an American [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[outfielder]] and [[third baseman]]. Bordagaray played for the [[Chicago White Sox]], [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]], [[St. Louis Cardinals]], [[Cincinnati Reds]], and [[New York Yankees]] between 1934 and 1945. He had a .283 [[batting average]] for his career.

Bordagaray gained publicity through the press through his colorful personality and various gimmicks. He appeared in [[bit part]]s in movies and grew a mustache in a time when baseball players were expected to be clean shaven. He has been inducted into the Brooklyn Dodgers Hall of Fame, and the [[Fresno County|Fresno]] and [[Ventura County]] Sports Halls of Fames.

==Early life==
Bordagaray was born in [[Coalinga, California]] on January 3, 1910 to Dominique and Louise Bordagaray, who were original settlers of the [[San Joaquin Valley]]. Bordagaray was the middle of seven children.<ref name=latobit/>

Of French descent, Bordagaray got his nickname from his mother.<ref name=obituary>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/23/sports/frenchy-bordagaray-is-dead-the-colorful-dodger-was-90.html|title=Frenchy Bordagaray Is Dead; The Colorful Dodger Was 90|first=Richard|last=Goldstein|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 23, 2000|accessdate=December 8, 2011}}</ref> His father wanted him to become a [[violin]]ist.<ref name=obituary/> He [[Letterman (sports)|lettered]] in baseball, [[American football|football]], and [[track and field]] at [[California State University, Fresno|Fresno State College]].<ref name=obituary/>

==Professional career==
===Early career (1931<U+2013>1933)===
Bordagaray made his professional baseball debut in [[minor league baseball]] with the [[Sacramento Solons|Sacramento Senators]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]] (PCL) during the [[1931 in baseball|1931 season]]. They originally gave him a three week tryout without pay, so that he could retain his amateur status; at the end of the tryout, the Senators offered Bordagaray his first professional contract.<ref name=lat/> At only 20 years of age, Bordagaray's father needed to provide his consent. Though his father initially refused and threatened to take the Senators to court, he changed his mind after visiting his son.<ref name=lat>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-25/sports/sp-2588_1_frenchy-bordagaray|title=The News of the Day: Frenchy Bordagaray, an 82-Year-Old Great-Grandfather Living in Ventura, Shocked the Baseball Establishment in 1930s With Such Gimmicks as Racing a Horse on Foot and Growning a Mustache, but His Flair Made Him a Media Darling|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|first=Jeff|last=Meyers|date=December 25, 1992|page=8|accessdate=December 9, 2011}}</ref> Fresno State's football coach, [[Stan Borleske]], attempted to negotiate Bordagaray's release, but Senators owner [[Lewis Moreing]] refused.<ref name=lat/>

Bordagaray led the PCL in [[batting average]] (.373) during the 1931 season.<ref name=lat/> He publicly held out from the Senators for more money during the offseason, which became an annual tradition for Bordagaray.<ref name=lat/> In the 1932 season, he batted&nbsp;.322 in [[games played]]. He followed this up by batting .351 in 117 games during the 1933 season.<ref name=minors>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=bordag001sta|title=Frenchy Bordagaray Minor League Statistics & History|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}</ref>

While he was off the field, the pitcher threw the ball, unaware he had no right fielder. The batter hit the pitch to right field, leading to a double. Manager [[Earl McNeely]] did not criticize Bordagaray, rather telling the pitcher to make sure his fielders were in place before throwing.<ref>Salin, pp. 180<U+2013>182</ref>
