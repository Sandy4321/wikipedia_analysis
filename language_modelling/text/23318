Venezuelan opposition parties, which had boycotted the [[Venezuelan parliamentary election, 2005|previous election]], thus allowing  the governing [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] (PSUV) to gain a two-thirds supermajority, participated in the election through the [[Coalition for Democratic Unity]] (MUD). Nationally, the popular vote was split equally between PSUV and MUD, but PSUV won a majority of the [[first-past-the-post]] seats and consequently retained a substantial majority in the Assembly, although falling short of the two-thirds majority mark.<ref name=Devereux>Devereux, Chrlie and Corina Rodriguez Pons.

Of the 165 deputies, 110 were constituency representatives elected on a [[first-past-the-post]], the system in 87 electoral districts, 52 elected on a [[party list]] system (two or three deputies per [[States of Venezuela|state of Venezuela]], depending on population), and 3 seats were reserved for indigenous peoples, with separate rules. Additionally, 12 representatives were chosen for the [[Latin American Parliament]]. 

There was initially a dispute between alliances that participated in the election as to which alliance received a plurality of votes.<ref>Dan Molinski, "Venezuela's Chavez Claims Popular-Vote Victory In Election", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100928-706902.html</ref><ref>"Venezuelan leader claims 'victory'", ''[[Al-Jazeera]]'', http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2010/09/201092812726888590.html</ref><ref>"Venezuelan opposition alliance claims it won 52 percent of popular vote", ''[[El Universal (Venezuela)|El Universal]]'', http://www.eluniversal.com/2010/09/27/en_pol_esp_venezuelan-oppositio_27A4527293.shtml</ref><ref>{{es icon}} "Sobre representaci<U+00F3>n perjudica a la oposici<U+00F3>n", ''[[El Universal (Venezuela)|El Universal]]'', http://eluniversal.com/2010/09/27/v2010_ava_sobre-representacion_27A4527053.shtml</ref>  Long-term international electoral observers were not invited to observe the election in any technical capacity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Instead, each coalition was allowed to invite 30 foreign officials to observe the elections.<ref name="eu">[[European Union]], "Declaration by the High Representative on behalf of the European Union on the elections in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela", http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/cfsp/116787.pdf</ref><ref name="oas">[[Organization of American States]], "OAS Officials are Special Guests to Election Day in Venezuela", http://www.oas.org/OASpage/press_releases/press_release.asp?sCodigo=E-349/10</ref>

==Background==
===Electoral reform===
Elections for the [[National Assembly of Venezuela]] in the [[Venezuelan parliamentary election, 2000|2000]] and the [[Venezuelan parliamentary election, 2005|2005]] were conducted under a weak [[mixed member proportional]] system, with 60% elected in [[first-past-the-post]] [[voting district]]s and the remainder by closed [[party list]] [[proportional representation]].<ref name=CNN>[[CNN]], [http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/election.watch/americas/venezuela.html Venezuela (Presidential)], accessed 27 September 2010</ref> This was an adaptation of the system previously used for the [[Venezuelan Chamber of Deputies]],<ref>Donna Lee Van Cott (2005), ''From movements to parties in Latin America: the evolution of ethnic politics'', [[Cambridge University Press]]. p29</ref> which had been introduced in 1993, with a 50-50 balance between voting districts and party lists,<ref name=Crisp>Crisp, Brian F. and Rey, Juan Carlos (2003), "The Sources of Electoral Reform in Venezuela", in Shugart, Matthew Soberg, and Martin P. Wattenberg, ''Mixed-Member Electoral Systems - The Best of Both Worlds?'', Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2003. pp. 173<U+2013>194(22)</ref> and deputies per state proportional to population, but with a minimum of three deputies per state.<ref>Crisp and Rey (2003:175)</ref>

For the 2010 election, the ''Ley Org<U+00E1>nica de Procesos Electorales (LOPE)'' (Basic law of electoral process) among other changes reduced the party list proportion to 30%.<ref>[[Venezuelanalysis.com]], 2 August 2009, [http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/4681 Venezuela Passes New Electoral Law]</ref> In addition, the law completely separated the district vote and the party list votes, creating a [[mixed member majoritarian]] system. Previously, parties winning nominal district seats had had these subtracted from the total won under the proportional party list, which had encouraged parties to [[game the system]] by creating separate parties for the party list.<ref>''[[Venezuelanalysis.com]]'', 1 October 2010, [http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/5683 A New Opportunity for Venezuela<U+2019>s Socialists]</ref> Under the new law, in 2009, electoral districts were [[Redistribution (election)|redefined]] in a way that has been accused of favouring the PSUV, particularly in giving more weight to votes in the countryside over those in the city.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite web|author=Carroll, Rory |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/27/hugo-chavez-congressional-election-venezuela|title=Venezuela election loosens Ch<U+00E1>vez's grip on power|date=27 September 2010|accessdate=27 September 2010|work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian Media Group}}</ref><ref name= NYTVote>Romero, Simon.

===Electoral process===
In August 2010 the CNE carried out vote simulations, with an average wait of 15<U+2013>22 minutes. In August/September it also carried out a series of electoral fairs, providing 1500 vote machines in 11 cities for educational purposes, to allow voters to familiarize themselves with the process. As usual in Venezuela, the voting will take place on a non-work day, and the sale of alcohol will be banned starting the day prior to elections. Voting booth attendees are chosen at random by the CNE; for this election, over 400,000 were chosen. Over 80,000 participated in training, compared to 40,000 in 2005.<ref name="VA100910">[[Venezuelanalysis.com]], 10 September 2010, [http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/5627 Chavez Allowed to Campaign Says Venezuelan Electoral Council]</ref>

Four domestic [[NGO]]s registered 624 observers each.<ref name=MH210910/> Unlike the election in 2005, major independent election observing organisations such as the [[Organization of American States]], the [[European Union]] and the [[Carter Center]] were not invited to observe this election in a technical capacity. Guests from those bodies allowed to observe the final days of the election were not given the technical observation role they had been given in the past. Instead, each alliance participating in the election was permitted to bring "up to 30 witnesses from abroad."<ref name="eu"/><ref name="oas"/><ref name=MH210910>''[[Miami Herald]]'', 21 September 2010, [http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/09/21/1836039/election-observers-coming-to-venezuela.html#ixzz10q7YpFPK "Election observers coming to Venezuela -- what will they see?"]</ref><ref>Center for Strategic and International Studies, "PSUV Seeks to Maintain a Majority in Venezuela<U+2019>s Upcoming Legislative Elections", http://csis.org/blog/psuv-seeks-maintain-majority-venezuela%E2%80%99s-upcoming-legislative-elections</ref> Around 150 international observers were accredited by the CNE, including from the [[United Nations]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[African Union]], the [[European Union]] by the end of August.<ref name=VA300810>[[Venezuelanalysis.com]], 30 August 2010, [http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/5600 As Elections Approach Venezuela Holds Vote Simulation, Promotes Voter Education]</ref> The European Union noted in a press release that "the Venezuelan National Electoral Council accredited more than 200 international guests to accompany the day of the election. No long-term international electoral observation missions participated."<ref name="eu" /> Foreign observers were warned in a full-page newspaper advertisement "not to interfere with the nation's internal affairs." An opposition spokesman said that "If observers were allowed to watch the campaign, they would have seen the abuse of power and of public resources and public media."<ref name=MH210910/> The government's [[Roy Chaderton]] said that foreign observers were present and that comments like this from the opposition were "part of the media terrorism they like to practice".<ref name=MH210910/> 

The CNE monitors political advertisements during campaigns, and reported that for a 3-day period at the end of August, opposition ads made up 75.4% of the airtime given to such ads, across the five main channels [[Venevisi<U+00F3>n]], [[Televen]], [[Globovisi<U+00F3>n]], [[Tves]] and [[Venezolana de Televisi<U+00F3>n]].<ref>Suggett, James.

In early September, one member of the five-person CNE, the pro-opposition councillor Vicente D<U+00ED>az, publicly accused Chavez of breaking campaign laws by using state-run television to "berate rivals and praise friends" during the election campaign.<ref name=Grapples/><ref name=Chavezbreaking/> Chavez denied breaking the law, and said that Diaz could be prosecuted for making false accusations.<ref name=Chavezbreaking>Toothaker, Christopher.

==Campaign==
A total of 6,465 candidates registered with the [[National Electoral Council (Venezuela)|National Electoral Council]] by the June deadline.<ref name=VA070610/> Around 17.5 million of the country's 28.5 million population are eligible to vote.<ref name=IPS270410/> The ruling [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] (PSUV), with around 7 million members, is by far the largest party in the country by membership.<ref name=VA170810/>

===PSUV===
In order to revise the party's statutes, programme, and primary voting methods, the ruling [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] planned a congress of 772 members representing the country's 759 municipalities. These members were elected by the members of the party in an election held on 15 November 2009.<ref>{{es icon}} {{verify credibility|date=October 2010}} {{Cite web|author=14.Nov.2009 / 06:21 am / Haga un comentario |url=http://www.psuv.org.ve/?q=node/6838 |title=listo para elecci<U+00F3>n de delegados al Congreso Extraordinario |publisher=PSUV |date=2009-11-14 |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> At this congress, beginning on 21 November 2009 and ending in March 2010,<ref>{{es}} {{Cite web|url=http://www.vtv.gov.ve/noticias-nacionales/26364 |title=1er Congreso Extraordinario del PSUV debatir<U+00E1> hasta el primer trimestre de 2010 &#124; Venezolana de Televisi<U+00F3>n |publisher=Vtv.gov.ve |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> members were to debate each weekend over the new standards of the party, in which are included voting and selection method for the upcoming parliamentary elections.<ref>{{es}} {{Cite web|author=pgbservices.com |url=http://www.antv.gob.ve/m8/noticiam8.asp?id=28849 |title=PSUV listo para Congreso Extraordinario - Noticia en ANTV |publisher=Antv.gob.ve |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> [[Primary election]]s were held on 2 May 2010, with over 2.5 million party members choosing over 3500 nominees for the 110 constituency representatives, in 87 electoral districts.<ref name=VA070610>[[Venezuelanalysis.com]], 7 June 2010, [http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/5412 6,465 Venezuelans to Run in National Assembly Elections]</ref> Nominees for the PSUV party lists were announced later that month.<ref>[[Venezuelanalysis.com]]'', 25 May 2010, [http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/5385 Venezuela<U+2019>s Chavez Announces PSUV Candidate Lists]</ref>

===Opposition===
The main Venezuelan opposition parties had boycotted the [[Venezuelan parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary election]], unexpectedly withdrawing just before election day, despite a dispute over the voting process apparently having been resolved with the support of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS).<ref>In the run-up to the election, there were concerns about the use of digital fingerprint scanners as part of the voting process. On 28 November the [[National Electoral Council (Venezuela)|National Electoral Council]] (CNE), in a decision brokered by the OAS, announced that it would not use the controversial machines. Despite this, several days later five opposition parties withdrew from the elections. "The move surprised election officials, and some reports indicate that international observers were unhappy that the opposition had reneged on a commitment to participate in the elections if the digital fingerprint machines were not used." - Mark Sullivan, Congressional Research Service, 28 July 2009, [http://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL32488.pdf Venezuela: Political Conditions and U.S. Policy]. (Archived by [[WebCite]] at [http://www.webcitation.org/5riTiru9f http://www.webcitation.org/5riTiru9f])</ref> Eleven deputies subsequently defected to the opposition or declared themselves independent.<ref name=IPS270410/>

In June 2009, it was reported that the opposition parties were planning to create the ''[[Mesa de la Unidad Democr<U+00E1>tica]]'' (Coalition for Democratic Unity, MUD) a coalition that would include all of the opposition parties which might select unique candidates for the upcoming elections.<ref>{{es}} {{Cite web|url=http://www.noticiasve.com/partidos-de-oposicion-conforman-mesa-de-la-unidad-democratica/ |title=Partidos de oposici<U+00F3>n conforman Mesa de la Unidad Democr<U+00E1>tica |publisher=Noticiasve.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> A previous opposition umbrella group, the ''[[Coordinadora Democr<U+00E1>tica (Venezuela)|Coordinadora Democr<U+00E1>tica]]'', had collapsed after the failure of the [[Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004|2004 recall referendum]].

By April 2010, the MUD included around 50 political parties, of which 16 were national in scope and the rest regional, and received support from some other social organisations and opinion groups.<ref name=IPS270410/> The main parties included in MUD are the traditional [[Democratic Action]] and [[COPEI]] (which held power from 1958 to 1998); the left groups [[Movement for Socialism (Venezuela)|Movement for Socialism]], [[Radical Cause]] and [[Red Flag Party]]; and more recently established parties [[A New Era]], [[Justice First]] and [[For Social Democracy]] ("PODEMOS").<ref name=IPS270410/> In April the MUD held primaries in 15 electoral districts, with 361,000 voters participating, and selecting 22 candidates (the remaining 143 candidates were chosen "by consensus").<ref name=IPS270410/> The candidates chosen included [[Maria Corina Machado]] (of [[Sumate]]) and [[Manuel Rosales]], the opposition's candidate in the [[Venezuelan presidential election, 2006|2006 presidential election]] and now in exile in Peru (due to corruption charges, which he denies).<ref name=IPS270410>IPS News, 27 April 2010, [http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=51218 Opposition Plans Return to Venezuelan Congress]</ref> In addition, a number of the nine police officials imprisoned for participating in the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'<U+00E9>tat attempt]], regarded by the MUD as political prisoners, were also nominated, in districts with a real chance of opposition success;<ref name=IPS270410/> winning would require their release due to [[parliamentary immunity]].<ref name=IPS270410/>

The MUD is supported by the [[Movimiento 2D]] opposition movement led by ''[[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]]'' editor and proprietor [[Miguel Henrique Otero]].<ref>{{es}} ''[[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]]'', 26 February 2010, [http://el-nacional.com/www/site/p_contenido.php?q=nodo/124882/Nacional/Movimiento-2D-apoyar%C3%A1-a-Mesa-de-la-Unidad-para-comicios-del-26-S Movimiento 2D apoyar<U+00E1> a Mesa de la Unidad para comicios del 26-S]</ref>

===Events===
In mid-August 2010 ''El Nacional'' sparked an international outcry when its frontpage publication of a graphic archival photo of bodies in a morgue, to illustrate a story about [[Venezuela#Crime|rising crime rates]], led the government to temporarily ban such publications.<ref>BBC, 18 August 2010, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11018751 Venezuela bans 'violent' photos in newspapers]</ref> The ban was later overturned.<ref>[[Venezuelanalysis.com]], 20 August 2010, [http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/5585 Venezuelan Court Retracts Ruling in Graphic Image Controversy]</ref> ''[[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]]'' editor and proprietor [[Miguel Henrique Otero]], leader of the opposition movement [[Movimiento 2D]], said that "The editorial reasoning behind the photo was to create a shock so that people could in some way react to a situation that the government has done absolutely nothing about."<ref>[[CNN]], 18 August 2010, [http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/08/17/venezuela.media.probe/index.html#fbid=vqKNdBhyH03&wom=false Venezuelan newspaper owner defends photo that spurred investigation]</ref> The incident brought further international attention to the issue of Venezuela's crime rates (having already received widespread attention as a leading issue of public concern<ref>[[Venezuelanalysis.com]], 30 March 2009, [http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/4338 Crime in Venezuela: Opposition Weapon or Serious Problem?]</ref>), and was followed by a ''[[New York Times]]'' article claiming Venezuela's murder rate was higher than that of Iraq,<ref>[[Simon Romero]]. ''[[New York Times]]'', 22 August 2010, [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/world/americas/23venez.html?_r=1 Venezuela, More Deadly Than Iraq, Wonders Why]</ref> although the comparison used [[Iraq Body Count]]'s numbers derived from media reports rather than the [[World Health Organization]]'s survey-based estimates, which are three times higher. The article mentioned the recent creation of the [[Bolivarian National Police]], and [[Experimental Security University]], but omitted the government's claim that as a result of these and other measures, Venezuela's homicide rate had fallen 18% in three months in the first half of 2010.<ref>[[Venezuelanalysis.com]], 3 June 2010, [http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/5407 National Police Deployment Reduces Homicides in Venezuela<U+2019>s Most Dangerous Municipalities],</ref> A September 2010 poll conducted by Alfredo Keller & Associates confirmed that crime was the top concern for Venezuelans heading into the September 26 parliamentary elections,<ref>''[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]'', 3 September 2010, [http://english.eluniversal.com/2010/09/03/en_ing_esp_election-campaign-fo_03A4423171.shtml Election campaign for new National Assembly heats up]</ref> as it had been for some time.

At the end of August the death of [[Franklin Brito]] due to a [[hunger strike]] led to widespread domestic and international media coverage. He had, since 2004, launched a series of unsuccessful legal challenges and dramatic public protests (including a series of hunger strikes) against an alleged government confiscation of part of his farm. The government maintained that his protests were related to land legally owned by his neighbours, and that his final hunger strike came after the disputed land titles had been withdrawn from his neighbours. The government accused the Venezuelan opposition of acting like "vultures" and desiring Brito's death for their own political ends in the context of the coming election.<ref>Cawthorne, Andrew.

Opinion polls vary widely, but the government-aligned GIS XXI (directed by former Chavez interior minister [[Jesse Chac<U+00F3>n]]) consistently gives poll predictions more favourable to PSUV than other pollsters. GIS XXI's predictions for the [[Venezuelan constitutional referendum, 2009|February 2009 constitutional referendum]] just before polling day tallied closely with those of the independent Instituto Venezolano de An<U+00E1>lisis de Datos (IVAD),<ref name=CP13Feb/> and both closely matched the outcome (a nearly 10 percent margin of victory for approval); opposition-linked companies were predicting heavy defeat as late as December 2008.<ref name=CP13Feb>''[[CounterPunch]]'', 13 February 2009,[http://www.counterpunch.org/maher02132009.html Venezuela's Term Limits]</ref>

In August 2010, the newspaper ''[[<U+00DA>ltimas Noticias]]'' published what it said was the result of an unpublished opinion poll by Datan<U+00E1>lisis, which showed the PSUV was likely to win 124 of the National Assembly's 165 seats, which would give it a two-thirds majority.<ref name=VA170810>[[Venezuelanalysis.com]], 17 August 2010, [http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/5576 As PSUV and Opposition Intensify National Assembly Campaigns, Polls Indicate Majority for Socialists]</ref> Datan<U+00E1>lisis later clarified that the results were a February 2010 extrapolation of the results of the last national election, the 2009 constitutional referendum.<ref name=EU082010>{{es}} ''[[El Universal (Venezuela)|El Universal]]'', 20 August 2010, [http://politica.eluniversal.com/2010/08/20/pol_art_datanalisis-niega-pr_2011494.shtml Datan<U+00E1>lisis niega proyecci<U+00F3>n de 124 curules para el PSUV]</ref>

==Results==

Complete results were available on 28 September, showing a turnout of 66.45%. The PSUV won 96 seats, the MUD 64 and the PPT 2. The PSUV thus lost their two-thirds majority in the assembly, and thus would not be able to pass [[organic law|organic legislation]] on its own, without the support of at least some members of the MUD opposition.  The PSUV also did not attain a three-fifths majority, which means it would not be able to pass [[enabling act|enabling legislation]] without the aid of 3 non-PSUV members of the National Assembly.<ref>Constitution of Venezuela, article 203 (page 75) http://www.analitica.com/bitblioteca/venezuela/constitucion_ingles.pdf</ref> The three seats reserved for indigenous peoples were elected from the [[Foundation for Integration and Dignification]], the [[Autonomous Movement of Zulia]] and from [[CONIVE]].<ref name=VA270910/> 

The election saw the PSUV total 58.18% of the Assembly seats (96 of 165 seats);<ref>59.26% of the Assembly seats not reserved for indigenous Venezuelans (96 of 162 seats).</ref> the PSUV attained this percentage of seats with 48.20% of the national vote.<ref>48.20% of the popular vote in the election for the 162 seats not reserved for indigenous Venezuelans; the PSUV did not run candidates for the 3 indigenous seats, nor did its main opponents, the MUD and the PPT.</ref>

PSUV got 95 seats and their coalition partner, the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV), got 3 seats. The PCV, Fatherland for All (PTT), and For Social Democracy (PODEMOS) were three of many parties who were part of Chavez's previous coalition, the Fifth Republic Movement, but which refused to be part of the fusion of several parties into the PSUV.

In the elections for the [[Latin American Parliament]], PSUV and MUD won five seats each, with the remaining seat going to an indigenous representative from CONIVE.<ref name=VA270910/> PSUV and MUD won 46.62% and 45.1% of the vote, respectively.<ref name=VA270910>[[Venezuelanalysis.com]], 27 September 2010, [http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/5662 (UPDATED) National Assembly Election Results- 95 Legislators for PSUV]</ref>

Chavez called the results a "solid victory."<ref name=APAllies>Toothaker, Christopher, The Associated Press, 27 September 2010.[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hnH8H_eglFrymD2NranoLmqWSN-QD9IG95980 The Associated Press "Chavez allies win congressional majority in vote".]</ref>

The price on Venezuelan bonds increased on news of the election results, described by Bloomberg as "Chavez<U+2019>s worst setback at the ballot box since taking office in 1999".<ref name=Bonds>Jaramillo, Andrea. Bloomberg, 27 September 2010. [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-27/venezuela-bond-yields-fall-to-five-week-low-as-chavez-loses-congress-vote.html Venezuelan Bonds Gain as Chavez Loses Congressional Seats in Worst Setback.]</ref>

===Analysis===
According to Reuters, "The new parliamentarians do not take their seats until January, so Chavez has a compliant Assembly for three months more to push through legislation."<ref name=Cawthorne>Cawthorne, Andrew. Reuters, 27 September 2010, [http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE68Q33O20100927 Analysis: Venezuela opposition buoyed for 2012 presidential race.]</ref>

After the election, the [[Spain|Spanish]] newspaper ''[[El Pa<U+00ED>s]]'' suggested that the PSUV and the MUD would have finished with 80&nbsp;seats each had the elections been run under the previous system.<ref>{{citation | title = Ch<U+00E1>vez se atraganta con su ley electoral | url = http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/Chavez/atraganta/ley/electoral/elpepuint/20100928elpepuint_7/Tes | newspaper = El Pa<U+00ED>s | date = 28 September 2010}}.</ref><ref>Indeed, the number of seats which would have been obtained in a strictly proportional system are close to these numbers. If the percentage of the 2010 party list vote gained by each of the main party alliances were multiplied by 165, the number of seats contested in the Assembly, the PSUV would have won 79.54 seats, the MUD would have won 77.83 seats, and the PPT would have won 5.17 seats (these figures are presented as decimals to reflect that different proportional representation rounding methods might round these figures up or down, depending on the methodology used to round the value to a whole number).  Multiplying the vote percentages instead by 162 (to reflect that three seats were elected separately by indigenous Venezuelans) would lower the results of the calculation to PSUV, 78.08 seats; MUD 76.42 seats; and PPT 5.09 seats.  (Figures derived from the CNE official vote results.)</ref> The Director of the [[National Electoral Council (Venezuela)|National Electoral Council]] (CNE) said that districts were drawn according to a standard national formula, and pointed out that the disproportionality involved in Venezuela's state-based mixed member majoritarian system didn't uniquely favour one party: in four states (Zulia, Tachira, Anzoategui and Nueva Esparta) PSUV obtained over 40% of the vote, but won only 7 seats against the opposition's 27.<ref>''[[Venezuelanalysis.com]]'', 28 September 2010, [http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/5674 CNE: Venezuelan Electoral Districts Drawn by Standard Method, Not Partisan Politics]</ref>
