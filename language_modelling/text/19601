'''Ohio State Route 130''' '''(OH 130)''' is a short east<U+2013>west [[state route]] in southwestern [[Ohio]].  The entirety of OH 130 lies within [[Butler County, Ohio|Butler County]].  OH 130 has its western terminus at a singalized intersection with [[U.S. Route 27 (Ohio)|US 27]] in [[McGonigle, Ohio|McGonigle]].  Its eastern terminus is also at a signalized intersection, this time at [[Ohio State Route 177|OH 177]] in the extreme northwestern corner of [[Hamilton, Ohio|Hamilton]].  For its entire length, OH 130 is alternately known as Old Oxford Road.

== Route description ==
OH 130 commences at a traffic signal with [[U.S. Route 27 (Ohio)|US 27]] immediately north of the CSX railway overpass of US 27 in the hamlet of [[McGonigle, Ohio|McGonigle]].  Just feet east of the beginning of OH 130 in the eastbound direction, the highway intersects Lanes Mill Road.  Turning southeasterly, OH 130 travels through [[Hanover Township, Butler County, Ohio|Hanover Township]] paralleling the CSX railway for a short distance.  Curving to the east, OH 130 passes by a fair mix of homes and farmland.  Approaching the Darrtown Road intersection, OH 130 begins to trend more southeasterly.  Beyond Darrtown Road, OH 130 continues as such through where it meets Morman Road.<ref name="yahoo">{{cite map|url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=39.436017&lon=-84.643559&zoom=14&q1=39.445396%2C-84.683363&q2=39.429736%2C-84.599807|title=Overview map of OH 130|publisher=Yahoo Maps|cartography=NAVTEQ|accessdate=2009-01-21}}</ref>  

At Krucker Road, OH 130 starts to resume a more easterly path.  The number of homes that appear along OH 130 starts to increase as the route passes by intersections with Boyle Road and Vizedom Road, and closes in on [[Hamilton, Ohio|Hamilton]].  OH 130, now serving a primarily residential vicinity, rounds some gentle curves, but maintains a generally easterly path as it nears its terminus.  Just barely sneaking into the northwestern corner of the City of Hamilton, OH 130 comes to an end as it meets [[Ohio State Route 177|OH 177]] at a signalized intersection.<ref name="yahoo"/>

== History ==
Through 1926, what is now OH 130 was part of then [[Ohio State Route 126|OH 126]], which included the entirety of the current OH 130 and the portion of the current [[U.S. Route 27 (Ohio)|US 27]] from OH 130 to the [[Indiana]] State Line at [[College Corner, Ohio|College Corner]].  Concurrent with the establishment of the U.S. highway system in 1926, the OH 126 designation was moved to another routing farther south, and OH 130 came into being along the routing that it occupies today.<ref name="1926map">{{cite map|title=Ohio State Map|year=1926|publisher=[[Ohio Department of Transportation]]}}</ref><ref name="1927map">{{cite map|title=Ohio State Map|year=1927|publisher=Ohio Department of Transportation}}</ref>
