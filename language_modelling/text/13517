'''Anne Hyde''' (12 March 1637{{spaced ndash}} 31 March 1671){{efn|All the dates in this article are [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]].}} was [[Duke of York and Albany|Duchess of York and Albany]] as the first wife of [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]] (later King James II and VII). Originally the Anglican daughter of a lawyer, Anne became James' first wife in 1660 after she fell pregnant by him, whereas James is said to have promised to marry her in 1659. The two had first met in Holland, while Anne was living in the household of James' sister Mary. However, of the eight children James and Mary had, six died in early childhood or early infancy.{{sfn|Weir|2008|pp=259<U+2013>60}} The two that survived to adulthood were [[Mary II of England|Lady Mary]], who succeeded her father after his deposition during the "[[Glorious Revolution]]" of 1688, and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Lady Anne]], who succeeded her brother-in-law and became the first monarch of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]].

Born the daughter of a commoner, Anne is primarily remembered for her marriage to James, which caused much gossip. Two months after the marriage, Anne gave birth to the couple's first child: it was obvious that the child had been conceived out of wedlock. Until towards the end of Anne's life, some observers disapproved of James' decision to marry Anne, all except King Charles II, James' brother, who wanted the marriage to take place. Another source of disapproval was the public affection James showed towards Anne, such as kissing and leaning against each other, which was improper behavior during the 1600s.

James was a known womanizer who kept many mistresses, for which Anne often gave him a hard time, once even complaining to the king, who sent one of James' mistresses to the countryside, where she remained until her death. Nonetheless, James [[Descendants of James II of England#Illegitimate issue|fathered many illegitimate children]]. Moreover, Anne was the reason her husband became a Roman Catholic. During Anne's and James' stays in Holland and France, respectively, they had both been exposed to Catholicism. Anne was so strongly attracted to this religion that she converted quickly after her marriage. Years later, James followed her example, which was a contributing factor to the [[Glorious Revolution]]. Suffering from advanced breast cancer, Anne died after the birth of her last child.

== Early years ==
In 1629, [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde]] married his first wife, Anne Ayliffe of Gretenham. Six months into the marriage, Anne caught smallpox, miscarried and died.{{sfn|Lister|1838|p=9}} Three years later, Hyde married his second wife, [[Frances Hyde, Countess of Clarendon|Frances Aylesbury]]. In 1637, Anne, the eldest daughter of the couple, was born at [[Cranbourne Lodge]] in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]].{{sfn|Weir|2008|p=259}} Virtually nothing, except that she was named after Edward Hyde's first wife, is known of her life before 1649, when her family fled to [[Holland]] after the execution of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]].{{sfn|Henslowe|1915|p=18}} They settled in [[Breda]], where the [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Princess of Orange]] (and also the Princess Royal), as she had done with many English fugitives,{{sfn|Henslowe|1915|p=19}} offered them a home and appointed Anne a maid of honor, apparently against the wishes of her mother and late father.{{sfn|Everett Green|1857|p=235}}

Anne became a general favorite with all the people she met either at [[The Hague]] or at the Princess of Orange's country house at Teyling. She was very attractive and stylish,{{sfn|Melville|2005|p=3}} and attracted many men. One of the first men to fall in love with Anne was Lord Spencer Compton, a son of the [[Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]].{{sfn|Henslowe|1915|p=34}} However, Anne quickly fell in love with [[Henry Jermyn, 1st Baron Dover|Lord Henry Jermyn]], who returned her feelings. Nonetheless, Anne dismissed Jermyn as quickly as she fell in love with him, when she met the [[James II of England|Duke of York]], the brother of the [[Charles II of England|deposed king]].{{sfn|Melville|2005|pp=3<U+2013>4}} On 24 November 1659, two{{sfn|Melville|2005|p=4}} or three{{sfn|Gregg|1984|p=2}} years after she first met him, James promised he would marry Anne.{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=44}} Charles, James' brother, forced the reluctant James to marry Anne, saying that her strong character would be a positive influence on his weak-willed brother.{{sfn|Softly|1979|p=91}}

As Anne was obviously pregnant, the couple were obliged to marry.{{sfn|Henslowe|1915|pp=130<U+2013>1}} They went through an official but private marriage ceremony on 3 September 1660, in [[London]], following the [[Restoration (England)|restoration]] of the [[monarchy]]. The wedding took place between eleven o'clock at night and two o'clock in the morning at Worcester House, her father's house in the [[Strand, London|Strand]], and was solemnised by James's chaplain, Dr. Joseph Crowther. The French Ambassador described Anne as having "courage, cleverness, and energy almost worthy of a King's blood".{{sfn|Fraser|2002|p=202}} The couple's first child, [[Charles Stuart, Duke of Cambridge (1660<U+2013>1661)|Charles]], was born in October of that year, but died seven months later. Seven children followed: [[Mary II of England|Mary]] (1662<U+2013>1694), [[James Stuart, Duke of Cambridge|James]] (1663<U+2013>1667), [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] (1665<U+2013>1714), [[Charles Stuart, Duke of Kendal|Charles]] (1666<U+2013>1667), [[Edgar Stuart, Duke of Cambridge|Edgar]] (1667<U+2013>1671) and two daughters, Henrietta (1669<U+2013>1669) and Catherine (1671<U+2013>1671); all of her sons and two of her daughters died in infancy.{{sfn|Weir|2008|pp=259<U+2013>60}}

Even well after James married Anne, some observers still disapproved of the prince's decision, regardless of what he had promised beforehand.{{sfn|Miller|2000|pp=44<U+2013>45}} Samuel Pepys said of the marriage: "[...] that the Duke of York<U+2019>s marriage with her hath undone the kingdom, by making the Chancellor so great above reach, who otherwise would have been but an ordinary man, to have been dealt with by other people [...]"<ref name="Pepys" /> In fact, after Anne's death, everyone at court struggled to find a new wife for James, but this new wife was not, under any circumstances, to be of humble birth.{{sfn|Strickland|1882|pp=242<U+2013>3}} As good a father as Pepys portrayed James to be, he strangely stated that Anne and James were unaffected by the death of their firstborn son.<ref>The Diary of Samuel Pepys, [http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/05/06/index.php Monday 6 May 1661].</ref> Pepys also described Anne as "not only the proudest woman in the world, but the most expensefull."<ref name="Pepys">The Diary of Samuel Pepys, [http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1667/06/24/index.php Monday 24 June 1667].</ref> Even in the minds of Anne's future son-in-law, [[William III of England|William III of Orange]] and that of her cousin-by-marriage, [[Sophia of Hanover]], the stigma of the Hydes' low birth could not disappear.{{sfn|Gregg|1984|pp=3<U+2013>4}}

[[File:The Duke and Duchess of York with their two daughters..jpg|thumb|right|A portrait of Anne, James and their two daughters, Lady Mary and Lady Anne.]]
Anne's married life was sometimes problematic,{{sfn|Melville|2005|p=17}} and she was not very much liked at court{{sfn|Melville|2005|p=19}} and James was unfaithful: he kept a variety of younger mistresses such as [[Arabella Churchill (royal mistress)|Arabella Churchill]], by whom he fathered many illegitimate children, including two born during Anne's lifetime; thus, he was called "the most unguarded ogler of his time."{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=46}} Anne did not turn a cold shoulder to this: Pepys wrote that she gave James a hard time because of her jealousy; but he also wrote that Anne and James were notorious for their public affections: they were kissing and leaning on each other in public. Pepys also wrote that when James fell in love with [[Elizabeth Stanhope, Countess of Chesterfield (d. 1665)|Lady Chesterfield]], Anne complained to the King Charles so insistently that Lady Chesterfield had to retreat to the countryside, where she remained until she died.{{sfn|Melville|2005|pp=21<U+2013>2}} Nonetheless, Anne was reported to have had her lovers as well, such as Lord Spencer Compton and [[Henry Sydney, 1st Earl of Romney|Lord Henry Sydney]] (son of the [[Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester|second Earl of Leicester]]). Others, however, state that only Henry was in love with Anne, but Anne was simply nice to Henry, in "an innocent way."{{sfn|Melville|2005|pp=25<U+2013>7}}

Anne became drawn to the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] faith, to which both she and James had been exposed during their time abroad.{{sfn|Miller|2000|pp=58<U+2013>9}}{{sfn|Callow|2000|pp=144<U+2013>5}} Almost immediately after the Restoration, Anne converted to Catholicism. In his biography of James II, John Callow states that Anne "made the greatest single impact upon his thinking."{{sfn|Callow|2000|p=144}} James also converted to Catholicism, but eight or nine years after his wife; however, he still attended Anglican services until as late as 1676.{{sfn|Callow|2000|pp=143<U+2013>4}}{{sfn|Waller|2002|p=135}} Additionally, James preferred to associate himself with Anglican and Protestant people, such as [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|John Churchill]],{{sfn|Callow|2000|p=149}} whose wife would later become a very close friend of Anne's youngest surviving daughter, Lady Anne.{{sfn|Curtis|1972|p=27}}{{sfn|Green|1970|p=21}} King Charles, although himself converting to Catholicism on his deathbed,{{sfn|Hutton|1989|pp=443; 456}} at the time opposed this religion and insisted that James' children be raised in the Anglican faith.{{sfn|Waller|2002|p=92}} Indeed, both of James and Anne's surviving daughters were raised as Anglicans.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|2003|p=32}}

Anne never quite recovered after the birth of her youngest son, Edgar; she was ill for fifteen months.{{sfn|Henslowe|1915|p=289}} After giving birth to one further child, Henrietta, in 1669, Anne gave birth to her youngest child in 1671, another daughter, whom she named Catherine.{{sfn|Weir|2008|p=260}} Anne never recovered from this last birth, her eighth.{{sfn|Gregg|1984|p=10}} Suffering from [[breast cancer]],{{sfn|Melville|2005|p=32}} Anne died on 31 March 1671.{{sfn|Weir|2008|p=259}}{{efn|England used the [[Julian calendar]] (OS) during Anne's lifetime.}} On her deathbed, her two brothers, [[Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon|Henry]] and [[Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester|Laurence]], tried to bring an Anglican priest to give her communion, but Anne refused{{sfn|Gregg|1984|p=10}} and furthermore, she received [[viaticum]] of the Roman Catholic Church.{{sfn|Melville|2005|p=32}} Two days later, her embalmed body was interred into [[Westminster Abbey]]'s [[Henry VII Chapel]] (precisely, into the vault of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]).{{sfn|Henslowe|1915|p=300}} In June, her only surviving son, Edgar, died of natural causes and in December, Anne's youngest daughter, Catherine, also died, leaving Ladies Mary and Anne as the Duke of York's heiresses.{{sfn|Waller|2002|pp=49<U+2013>50}} Two years after the loss of his first wife, James married a Catholic princess, [[Mary of Modena]], who offered James his only son that survived to adulthood, [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Francis Edward]]. During the [[Glorious Revolution]], James was deposed and the throne was occupied by Anne's eldest daughter Mary and her husband.{{sfn|Devine|2006|p=3}} After their respective deaths, Anne's youngest daughter, Anne, became the first sovereign of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].{{sfn|Gregg|1984|p=240}} After Anne's death, a portrait of her painted by [[Willem Wissing]], commissioned by the future Mary II used to hang above the door of the Queen's Drawing Room of the Garden House at [[Windsor Castle]].<ref>''[[Royal Collection]]'': [http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/401234 James, Duke of Cambridge (1663-7) by Wissing]</ref>
