'''Olvir Rosta''' ([[Old Norse]]: '''<U+00D6>lvir r<U+00F3>sta <U+00DE>orlj<U+00F3>tsson'''), also known as '''Aulver Rosta''', is a character within the mediaeval ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]'', who is purported to have lived during the early 12th century. His Old Norse [[byname]], ''r<U+00F3>sta'', means "brawl", "riot". 

Olvir appears in the saga as the son of <U+00DE>orlj<U+00F3>t, and Steinnv<U+00F6>r 'the Stout'. The mother of Steinnv<U+00F6>r is Frak<U+00F6>kk, who has been described as one the great villains of the entire saga. One of Frak<U+00F6>kk's sisters, Helga, is the [[concubine]] of Earl [[Haakon Paulsson|H<U+00E1>kon P<U+00E1>lsson]]. Part of the saga relates of how the [[Earldom of Orkney]] is for a time jointly run by half-brothers<U+2014>[[Harald Haakonsson|Haraldr H<U+00E1>konsson]] and [[Paul Haakonsson|P<U+00E1>ll H<U+00E1>konsson]], who are both sons of Earl H<U+00E1>kon. With the death of Earl Haraldr, son of Helga, Frak<U+00F6>kk's family falls out of favour, and are forced to leave Orkney. In time, Frak<U+00F6>kk conspire with the father of Earl [[R<U+00F6>gnvald Kali Kolsson|R<U+00F6>gnvaldr]], and agrees to a plan to take the Orkney by force and split it with Earl R<U+00F6>gnvaldr. She and Olvir eventually make their way to the ''[[Su<U+00F0>reyjar]]'', and may their return in a bid to win half of the earldom. However, their small fleet of ships are defeated in battle against Earl P<U+00E1>ll. The saga also tells of how Olvir kills an Orkney chieftain who fought against him during the sea-battle<U+2014>by burning the man to death within his house. The chieftain's vengeful son later tracks down Olvir and Frak<U+00F6>kk, at their own home in [[Sutherland]]. After a short battle behind their homestead, Olvir's men are routed and Frak<U+00F6>kk is burned to death within her house; Olvir flees from the scene, making for the ''Su<U+00F0>reyjar'', and is not heard from again. 

Olvir has also been associated with several places in Sutherland, some of which may bear his name. It has been proposed that Olvir Rosta may be an ancestor of either one of two [[Scottish clan]]s from the [[Outer Hebridean]] island of [[Lewis]].  In 1962 a runestone was uncovered in the [[Inner Hebrides]] which bore the name ''<U+00D6>lvir''. It has been suggested that the men mention on this stone were family relations of Olvir.

==Background==

Olvir Rosta, is a character in the mediaeval ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]''. His name in [[Old Norse]] is ''<U+00D6>lvir r<U+00F3>sta''. The 17th century [[Icelandic people|Icelandic]] historian [[<U+00DE>orm<U+00F3><U+00F0>ur Torfason]], who wrote [[Latin]] histories which covered events the [[Northern Isles]] and north-east of [[Scotland]], rendered Olvir's name as ''Aulver Rosta''.<ref name="P1-94130">[[#P1|Pope 1866]]: pp. 94<U+2013>130.</ref> Olvir's [[byname]], ''r<U+00F3>sta'', means "brawl", "riot".<ref>[[#V2|Vigfusson 1874]]: pp. 501, 503.</ref> Both his name and byname are represented various ways in English [[secondary sources]].{{#tag:ref|Over the years, Olvir Rosta has been referred to with several different English names: "Olvir the Turbulent",<ref name="T1-364"/> "Aulver the Brawler",<ref>[[#C1|Carr 1864<U+2013>66]]: p. 78.</ref> "Olvir Brawl",<ref name="W1-129133"/> "Olvi Riot",<ref>[[#A2|Anderson, AO; Anderson, MO 1990]]: pp. 191<U+2013>192.</ref> "Olvir the Riotous",<ref>[[#M2|Moncreiffe of that Ilk 1967]]: p. 160.</ref> and "<U+00D6>lvi the Unruly";<ref name="J1-157165">[[#J1|Johnson 1912]]: pp. 157<U+2013>165.</ref> his [[byname]] has also been rendered into English as "strife".<ref name="A1-6973"/><ref name="ref-APMacLeod"/>|group=note}} The saga describes him as "the tallest of men, and strong in limb, exceedingly overbearing, and a great fighter".<ref>[[#R1|Roberts 1999]]: p. 129.</ref><ref name="Matheson1"/>

The ''Orkneyinga saga'' states that Olvir was the son of <U+00DE>orlj<U+00F3>t, from ''Rekav<U+00ED>k''. The 19th century historian Joseph Anderson was of the opinion that ''Rekav<U+00ED>k'' likely refers to Rackwick on the island of [[Hoy]], [[Orkney]]; or possibly, but less likely, to Rackwick on the island of [[Westray]], Orkney. The saga states that Olvir's mother was <U+00DE>orlj<U+00F3>t's wife, Steinnv<U+00F6>r 'the Stout'.<ref name="A1-6973"/> Olvir's parents had several other children in the saga: sons Magn<U+00FA>s, Ormr, Moddan, Eindri<U+00F0>i; and daughter Au<U+00F0>hildr.<ref name="W1-129133"/> Steinnv<U+00F6>r's mother is given as Frak<U+00F6>kk; her father was Frak<U+00F6>kk's husband, Lj<U+00F3>tr 'Villain', from [[Sutherland]].<ref name="A1-6973"/> The saga states that Frak<U+00F6>kk was a daughter of Moddan, a wealthy and noble farmer from ''i Dali'', "Dale". According to 21st century historian Gareth Williams, this probably refers to a dale within the "Dales of Caithness". The 21st century historian Barbara Crawford stated that the Dales of Caithness refer to "that part of Caithness which includes the river valleys running down towards the [[Pentland Firth]]".<ref name="W1-133137">[[#W1|Williams 2007]]: pp. 133<U+2013>137.</ref> The saga records that another daughter of Moddan's was Helga, who was the [[concubine]] of the [[Earl of Orkney|Orcadian earl]], [[Haakon Paulsson|H<U+00E1>kon P<U+00E1>lsson]], and the mother of the earl's son, Earl [[Harald Haakonsson|Haraldr H<U+00E1>konsson]].<ref name="A1-6973"/> According to the saga, Frak<U+00F6>kk's brothers included: Engus 'the Generous'; and Earl <U+00D3>ttarr, from [[Thurso]], who is described as "a man worthy of honour". The saga declares that the descendants of Moddan "were high-born and thought a lot of themselves". Williams noted that Frak<U+00F6>kk appears as one of the great [[villain]]s of the ''Orkneyinga saga''. Williams noted that while some of Moddan's descendants had legitimate claims for the earldom, Frak<U+00F6>kk did not<U+2014>however, she made a claim on behalf of her descendants, specifically Olvir.<ref name="W1-129133">[[#W1|Williams 2007]]: pp. 129<U+2013>133.</ref>

Williams was of the opinion that the power base of Moddan, and his son Earl <U+00D3>ttarr, was in [[Caithness]] and [[Sutherland]], not in Orkney.<ref name="W1-129133"/> The saga states that Frak<U+00F6>kk held lands, which according to Williams, were located near the modern town of [[Helmsdale]], Sutherland. Williams noted that the saga specifically states that Frak<U+00F6>kk's husband was from Sutherland. and in consequence, Williams considered that these lands probably passed to her through her marriage. The size of these lands is unknown. Crawford suggested that they covered most of Sutherland: that after the Frak<U+00F6>kk's death, and the departure of Olvir, the lands were inherited by her relative Eir<U+00ED>kr 'Stay-brail' (see illustrated family tree), and in turn by his son, before passing into the possession of the [[Clan Murray|de Moravia family]]. In Williams' opinion, Crawford may have exaggerated the extent of these lands somewhat. Williams observed that another base of power for Frak<U+00F6>kk and Olvir may have been the ''[[Su<U+00F0>reyjar]]'' ("Southern Islands")<U+2014>which can include both the [[Hebrides]], and the [[Isle of Mann]]. The saga states at one point, Frak<U+00F6>kk and Olvir traveled to the ''Su<U+00F0>reyjar'' to gather ships and men; later the ''Su<U+00F0>reyjar'' are the destination of Olvir in his last appearance in the saga. Williams noted that the ''Su<U+00F0>reyjar'' appear many times in the sagas as a target for raids, and conquests, for Orcadian earls; as well as being the source for attacks on the earldom itself. Williams also noted that it is possible that saga's association of Frak<U+00F6>kk and Olvir with the ''Su<U+00F0>reyjar'' may be a [[Red herring (idiom)|red-herring]]. He stated that "if there was an Orcadian tradition of the Su<U+00F0>reyjar as a haunt of ne<U+2019>er-do-wells, this would provide an alternative explanation for the references within Orkneyinga saga, including those to do with Moddan's family". Even so, Williams considered that the saga seems to imply that the family had dynastic connections with important individuals of the ''Su<U+00F0>reyjar'', including [[Olaf I Godredsson|'<U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fr 'Titbit']], [[King of Mann and the Isles]].<ref name="W1-133137"/>

==''Orkneyinga saga''==
[[File:Flatey Book, Orkneyinga saga.jpg|thumb|A page from chapter 93 of the ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]'', as it appears in the 14th century ''[[Flateyarb<U+00F3>k]]''.<ref>[[#V1|Vigfusson 1887]]: pp. xxxvi<U+2013>xxxvii.</ref>]]
    
The main source for the life of Olvir is the ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]'', which was compiled sometime around 1200 by an unknown [[Icelandic people|Icelander]]. The saga is thought to have been based upon poetry, [[oral tradition]], and other written material. The original version ended with the death of [[Sweyn Asleifsson|Sveinn <U+00C1>sleifarson]] (an enemy of Olvir and Frak<U+00F6>kk). The saga is considered to become more accurate as events approach the writer's own time.<ref>[[#P2|P<U+00E1>lsson 1981]]: pp. 9<U+2013>12.</ref> In the late 14th century, the saga was revised and edited and included in the Icelandic ''[[Flateyarb<U+00F3>k]]''. The saga can be summed up as an account of the lives of many of the earls of Orkney, from the 9th to 13th centuries. According to [[research fellow]] Ian Beuermann, the saga is useful not for the specific events it describes, but rather for the ability to learn of "the ideas shaping the texts during the periods of composition or revision". For example, it is possible that one of the main characters of the saga, Sveinn <U+00C1>sleifarson, never existed; or at least it is quite possible that the historical Sveinn was different than the saga's portrayal of him.<ref name="Beuermann">{{cite web |url=http://www.cas.uio.no/Publications/Seminar/Confluence_Beuermann.pdf |format=[[pdf]] |title=A Chieftain in an Old Norse Text: Sveinn <U+00C1>sleifarson and the Message behind Orkneyinga Saga |author=Beuermann, Ian |date= |work=www.cas.uio.no |publisher= |accessdate=21 March 2010}}</ref> Another source which mentions Olvir is [[<U+00DE>orm<U+00F3><U+00F0>ur Torfason]]'s 17th century history of Orkney, which follows the ''Orkneyinga saga''.

===Frak<U+00F6>kk, and Helga, forced out of Orkney by Earl P<U+00E1>ll===

The ''Orkneyinga saga'' relates how after the death of Earl H<U+00E1>kon P<U+00E1>lsson, his sons, Haraldr H<U+00E1>konsson, and [[Paul Haakonsson|P<U+00E1>ll H<U+00E1>konsson]], divided the earldom between themselves. However, the half-brothers soon began to disagree with one another, and their [[vassal]]s divided into competing factions. The saga relates how one day Frak<U+00F6>kk, and her sister Helga (mother of Earl Haraldr), were [[sewing]] a snow-white garment embroidered with gold. This garment was enchanted, and the two sisters had intended it for Earl Haraldr's half-brother, Earl P<U+00E1>ll. Unfortunately for the sisters, Earl Haraldr noticed the beautiful garment and, despite their protestations, put the garment on and soon after died. The saga states that Earl P<U+00E1>ll immediately took control of his deceased half-brother's possessions, and that he was highly suspicious of the two sisters. In consequence, Frak<U+00F6>kk and Helga were no longer welcome in the earldom, and they left for Caithness, and from there move to Sutherland where Frak<U+00F6>kk had an estate. In time, several of Frak<U+00F6>kk's descendants were brought up in Sutherland<U+2014>including her daughter, Steinnv<U+00F6>r 'the Stout', and grandson, Olvir.<ref name="A1-6973">[[#A1|Anderson, J 1873]]: pp. 69<U+2013>73.</ref>

===Alliance with Earl R<U+00F6>gnvaldr against Earl P<U+00E1>ll===

The saga relates of how, during an earlier time, [[R<U+00F6>gnvald Kali Kolsson|Kali Kolsson]] assisted [[Harald Gilli|Haraldr gilli]] in being recognised as an [[illegitimate]] son of the deceased Norwegian king, [[Magnus Barelegs|Magn<U+00FA>s 'Barefoot']].<ref>[[#A1|Anderson, J 1873]]: pp. 75<U+2013>76.</ref> In consequence, the reigning king, [[Sigurd I of Norway|Sigur<U+00F0>r Magn<U+00FA>sson]], was Haraldr gilli's half-brother. The Norwegian king, appointed Kali as an earl of one half of Orkney, and also had Kali's name changed to ''R<U+00F6>gnvaldr'' (after [[Rognvald Eysteinsson|a prominent earl]] from the past).<ref>[[#A1|Anderson, J 1873]]: pp. 82<U+2013>83.</ref> On the death of Sigur<U+00F0>r, his son, [[Magnus IV of Norway|Magn<U+00FA>s Sigur<U+00F0>arson]], succeeded to the kingdom. When Haraldr gilli learned of Sigur<U+00F0>r's death he gathered his supporters and successfully underwent an [[ordeal]] to prove his paternity, and was accepted as king of one half of the kingdom. For three years the joint-kings maintained an uneasy peace with one another, but on the fourth year hostilities finally broke out. A battle was fought where the vastly outnumbered Haraldr gilli was defeated; in consequence he fled to the protection of the [[King of Denmark]]. The following Yule-tide, Haraldr gilli returned to Norway, captured Magn<U+00FA>s and [[maim]]ed him. Haraldr gilli then became king of the entire kingdom. That spring, in recognition for R<U+00F6>gnvaldr's assistance, the king renewed the grant of islands and the title of earl to R<U+00F6>gnvaldr.<ref>[[#A1|Anderson, J 1873]]: pp. 83<U+2013>85.</ref> James Gray, who summarised the events depicted within the saga, dated the death of Sigur<U+00F0>r Magn<U+00FA>sson to the year 1126; he dated the capture and mutilation of Magn<U+00FA>s Sigur<U+00F0>arson to 1135.<ref>[[#G1|Gray 1922]]: p. 61.</ref>

According to the saga, sometime after Haraldr gilli's victory over Magn<U+00FA>s Sigur<U+00F0>arson, Earl R<U+00F6>gnvaldr's father, Kolr, sent messengers to Earl P<U+00E1>ll, demanding that Earl P<U+00E1>ll hand over the lands which the Norwegian king had granted to Earl R<U+00F6>gnvaldr. When Earl P<U+00E1>ll refused this, Kolr's messengers proceeded to Caithness, where Frak<U+00F6>kk lived. The messengers related to Frak<U+00F6>kk of Kolr's proposal<U+2014>that if she and Olvir were to defeat Earl P<U+00E1>ll, half of the earldom would be theirs. Frak<U+00F6>kk agreed to the plan, saying that she would attack in mid-summer; she promised that during upcoming winter she would gather forces from her kinsmen, friends, and connections in Scotland and the ''Su<U+00F0>reyjar'' for the task. The next winter Earl R<U+00F6>gnvaldr and two of his chiefs, S<U+00F6>lmundr and J<U+00F3>n, gathered a force of men and about five or six ships for their expedition. The following summer their forces sailed from Norway to Shetland, where they were well received by the local [[bondsmen]]. Meanwhile, Frak<U+00F6>kk and Olvir assembled a small fleet of twelve ships in the ''Su<U+00F0>reyjar''<U+2014>although the saga describes the ships as small and poorly manned. At the middle of summer, Frak<U+00F6>kk and Olvir sailed for Orkney to fulfil their pledge of wresting the earldom from Earl P<U+00E1>ll.<ref>[[#A1|Anderson, J 1873]]: pp. 85<U+2013>87.</ref>

===Sea-battle against Earl P<U+00E1>ll===

According to the ''Orkneyinga saga'' saga, when Earl P<U+00E1>ll herd of Earl R<U+00F6>gnvaldr's arrival in Shetland, he held council and decided to immediately gather forces and attack Earl R<U+00F6>gnvaldr before he could be reinforced by the incoming men he knew were coming from the ''Su<U+00F0>reyjar''. That night Earl P<U+00E1>ll was joined by five chieftains, with four ships<U+2014>this brings his total forces to five ships. The fleet sailed to [[Rousay]], where they arrive at sunset. During the night the force is further strengthened by arriving men. In the morning, as the fleet is about to set out for Shetland to meet Earl R<U+00F6>gnvaldr, about ten or twelve ships were spotted coming from the [[Pentland Firth]]. Earl P<U+00E1>ll and his men were certain these ships were those of Frak<U+00F6>kk and Olvir; in consequence, the earl ordered the fleet to intercept. The saga states that when Olvir's ships were east of Tankerness, they then sailed west from Mulls Head, Deerness. By this time, Earl P<U+00E1>ll was further strengthened by a chieftain from Tankerness. The earl then ordered his ships to be bound together, and for a bondi to gather stones for the upcoming battle. When the earl and his troops have fully prepared themselves, the saga states that Olvir's forces madd their attack.<ref name="A1-8790"/>

Although the saga states that the forces of Olvir were superior in numbers to those of Earl P<U+00E1>ll, it also notes that Olvir's ships were smaller. Olvir brought his own ship up next to the earl's, where the fighting was the fiercest. One of the earl's chieftains, <U+00D3>lafr Hr<U+00F3>lfsson, attacked Olvir's smallest ships, and cleared three of them in a short time. Olvir urged his men forward and was the first to board Earl P<U+00E1>ll's own ship. When he spotted Earl P<U+00E1>ll, Olvir threw a spear at him, and although it was blocked by a shield, the force of the blow knocked the earl onto the deck. With the fall of Earl P<U+00E1>ll, a great shout goes up; but just at that moment, one of the earl's best men, Sveinn 'Breastrope', hurled a large stone at Olvir, hitting him square in the chest and knocked him overboard. Although Olvir's men dragged him from the water, it was unclear to the battlers whether he lived or not. Olvir's disheartened men were driven off the earl's ship, and began to withdraw. Olvir eventually recovered his wits, but was unable to rally his troops<U+2014>the battle was lost. Earl P<U+00E1>ll pursued Olvir's fleeing fleet into the Pentland Firth, before giving up the chase. Five of Olvir's ships were left behind, and were captured and manned by the forces loyal to Earl P<U+00E1>ll. The earl is later further strengthened by two [[longship]]s, and his forces swells to twelve ships. The next day, Earl P<U+00E1>ll sailed to Shetland, where he destroyed Earl R<U+00F6>gnvaldr's fleet. Although, Earl R<U+00F6>gnvaldr's forces remained on Shetland itself, Earl P<U+00E1>ll successfully held onto the earldom.<ref name="A1-8790">[[#A1|Anderson, J 1873]]: pp. 87<U+2013>90.</ref> Gray stated that these battles were fought in the year 1136.<ref>[[#G1|Gray 1922]]: p. 62.</ref>

===Burning of <U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fr Hr<U+00F3>lfsson===

The ''Orkneyinga saga'' states that three days before [[Yule]], Olvir, and his band of men, arrived in Duncansby.<ref name="A1-9192"/> Williams stated that the farm of [[Duncansby Head|Duncansby]], located near the Dales of Caithness, was then in hands of an Orkney chieftain, <U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fr Hr<U+00F3>lfsson.<ref name="W1-129133"/> Joshua Prescott stated that <U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fr appears to have been Earl P<U+00E1>ll's main supporter in Caithness;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/741 |title=University of St Andrews Digital Research Repository: Earl Rognvaldr Kali: crisis and development in twelfth-century Orkney |work=[[University of St Andrews]] |accessdate=5 March 2010 }} The specific link to the cited thesis is: {{cite web |url=https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/10023/741/6/Joshua%20Prescott%20MPhil%20thesis.PDF |format=[[pdf]] |author=Prescott, Joshua |title=Earl Rognvaldr Kali: crisis and development in twelfth-century Orkney |date=June 2009 |work=[[University of St Andrews]] |accessdate=5 March 2010 }}</ref> according to Williams, <U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fr appears to have held these lands directly from the Earls of Orkney, rather than as a family possession.<ref name="W1-129133"/> The saga relates of how at Duncansby, Olvir and his party surprised <U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fr within his own house. They then set fire to the house, and burn <U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fr to death within. Olvir and his men took all the [[loot|movable property]] they could get their hands on, before leaving the scene. When Earl P<U+00E1>ll heard of what has happened, he takes-in the slain chieftain's son, Sveinn <U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fsson. With the death of his father, Sveinn <U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fsson becomes known as [[Sweyn Asleifsson|Sveinn <U+00C1>sleifarson]]<U+2014>after his mother.<ref name="A1-9192">[[#A1|Anderson, J 1873]]: pp. 91<U+2013>92.</ref> Such house-burnings<U+2014>in which individuals are burnt to death, or slain as they flee the fire<U+2014>are found throughout the sagas as a part of [[blood feud]]s.<ref name="J1-157165"/> The saga states that some time later, Sveinn, who has spent time in the ''Su<U+00F0>reyjar'' and [[Atholl]], returned to Orkney. On his way, Sveinn he stopped at Thurso, where his accomplice, [[Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr]], negotiated a truce between Sveinn and Frak<U+00F6>kk's brother, Earl <U+00D3>ttarr. The earl payed Sveinn compensation for the death of <U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fr, and promised his friendship. In return, Sveinn promised to aid Earl <U+00D3>ttarr's relative, [[Erlend Haraldsson|Erlendr Haraldsson]], in a possible bid for the earldom of Orkney.<ref>[[#A1|Anderson, J 1873]]: pp. 105<U+2013>106.</ref>

===Defeat of Olvir, and the burning of Frak<U+00F6>kk===

The saga states that some time later, Sveinn approached Earl R<U+00F6>gnvaldr, and asked the earl for men and ships to take vengeance upon Olvir and Frak<U+00F6>kk who were involved in the burning of his father. The earl consented to this request, and gave Sveinn two ships. Sveinn traveled south to ''Borgarfi<U+00F6>rd'', and then west to ''D<U+00FA>feyrar''. According to Anderson, ''Borgarfi<U+00F6>rd'' may refer to the [[Moray Firth]]; and ''D<U+00FA>feyrar'' likely refers to the shore in the parish of [[Duffus]], on the coast of [[Moray]]. The saga states that from ''D<U+00FA>feyrar'', Sveinn traveled to ''Ekkialsbakki'', and from there went to Atholl, where he met Earl Madda<U+00F0>r.<ref name="A1-114116"/> Anderson stated that ''Ekkialsbakki'', in the case, likely refers to the coast on the Moray Firth, next to Atholl.<ref>[[#A1|Anderson, J 1873]]: p. 107.</ref> The saga then relates how the earl gave Sveinn guides, and how Sveinn traveled through the interior of the country<U+2014>over mountains, and through woods, away from inhabited areas<U+2014>until he came upon Strath Helmsdale, near where Olvir and Frak<U+00F6>kk lived.<ref name="A1-114116"/> Williams stated that since the saga records that Sveinn approached the area by land, the site of Olvir and Frak<U+00F6>kk's estate was probably located somewhere in the dale of Helmsdale<U+2014>not where [[Helmsdale|the modern village]] is situated on the coast. Williams also noted that this area was quite remote from Orkney, and that it may have been outside of the control of the earldom.<ref name="W1-129133"/> The saga states that Olvir and Frak<U+00F6>kk had spies on the lookout; however, because of the route taken by Sveinn, they were unaware of his presence until Svienn occupied a certain slope behind their homestead. The saga states that Olvir and sixty of his men confronted Sveinn,<ref name="A1-114116"/> although <U+00DE>orm<U+00F3><U+00F0>ur Torfason's account of the incident gives forty.<ref name="P1-94130"/> After a short clash, the saga states that, Olvir's men soon gave way, and many were killed in the ensuing rout. Olvir survived the clash, and fled up Helmsdale river. Meanwhile, Sveinn and his men continued on towards the houses. The are was plundered, and the houses were burnt to the ground with their inmates still inside<U+2014>and in this way Frak<U+00F6>kk perished. The saga states that Sveinn and his men commit many ravages in Sutherland before returning home. Upon reaching the river, Olvir flees through the mountains, and is last heard making for the ''Su<U+00F0>reyjar''; he is not mentioned again within the ''Orkneyinga saga''.<ref name="A1-114116">[[#A1|Anderson, J 1873]]: pp. 114<U+2013>116.</ref>{{#tag:ref|When noting how [[<U+00DE>orm<U+00F3><U+00F0>ur Torfason]]'s account relates of how Olvir fled towards the [[Western Isles]], Pope considered it probable that he was the man who married Paul Mactier's daughter, and who had in consequence received her lands of [[Strath Oykel]]. To back up this proposition, Pope stated that the man was supposed to have been a [[Danish people|Dane]] or a [[Norwegian people|Norweigian]]; Pope also considered that ''Aulver'' was the same name as ''Leander''. According to Pope, there was a common tradition which stated that Paul Mactier gave the lands of Strath Oykel to his daughter after she married a nobleman from [[Norway]], who was named ''Leander''. Pope stated that this man's descendants were called "Clan Landus".<ref name="P1-131132"/> However, Pope's ''Leander'' actually refers to the Gaelic name ''GillAndrais'' / ''GilleAnrias'', meaning 'the servant of St Andrew', which has been [[Anglicised]] as ''[[Gillanders]]''.|group=note}} Later on within the saga, another of Frak<U+00F6>kk's grandsons, [[Thorbjorn Thorsteinsson|<U+00DE><U+00F3>rbj<U+00F6>rn 'Clerk']], who is a [[brother-in-law]] and close friend of Sveinn, has two of Sveinn's men killed for their part in the burning.<ref>[[#A1|Anderson, J 1873]]: pp. 118<U+2013>119.</ref>

Several writers have noted a place which is said to be the location of the burning. The [[CANMORE]] website states that a supposed castle in which Frak<U+00F6>kk was burned is supposed to be located at {{gbmapping|NC8728}}, near [[Kinbrace]], within the parish of Kildonan.<ref name="canmore1">{{cite web |url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/6653/details/kinbrace/ |title=Kinbrace |work=[[CANMORE]] |accessdate=6 March 2010 }}</ref> In 1769, [[Thomas Pennant]] noted the episode of the burning, and stated that certain ruins at Kinbrace were called "Cairn Shuin"; and that these were the remnants of the homestead that Sveinn burnt.<ref>[[#P3|Pennant 1769]]: pp. 361<U+2013>363.</ref> [[Reverand|Rev.]] Sage, in his account of the parish in the ''[[Statistical Account of Scotland|(Old) Statistical Account of Scotland]]'', noted the ruins mentioned by Pennant; he called them "Cairn-Suin", and translated this to "Old Cairns".

Pope also stated that to the south-west of this location there was a part of Helmsdale river called "Avin Aulver". Another location he connected with Olvir was a hill, in the forest of "Sletie", called "Craggan Aulver".<ref name="P1-131132">[[#A1|Pope 1866]]: pp. 131<U+2013>132.</ref>

==Speculation of Scottish descendants==

According to Williams, it is possible that after Sveinn defeated Olvir and Frak<U+00F6>kk, Olvir may have fled to kinsmen of his in the ''Su<U+00F0>reyjar''. Williams suggested that the [[blood feud]] between the families may be a reason for Sveinn's military activities in the Hebrides and the Isle of Mann, afterwards; although Sveinn had other interests in the area, since he is stated to have married the window of a Manx king.<ref name="W1-137149">[[#W1|Williams 2007]]: pp. 137<U+2013>149.</ref> In the late 19th century, [[antiquary]] [[F. W. L. Thomas|F.W.L. Thomas]] speculated that the memory of Olvir may have been preserved in the Hebrides. Thomas stated that within the mythological history of the [[Outer Hebrides|Outer Hebridean]] island of [[Lewis]], the island clan of [[Clan Macaulay of Lewis|Macaulays]] were said to be the descendants of a man named ''[[Amhlaebh]]'', who was one of the twelve sons, or near relations, of a man named ''[[Oliver (given name)|Oliver]]'', among whom Lewis was divided. This ''Oliver'' was said to have been the eldest son of the Norse king who was given the Isles and [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] by a son of [[Kenneth MacAlpin]], for his assistance in driving his own brother from Scotland.<ref name="T1-364">[[#T1|Thomas 1879<U+2013>80]]: p. 364.</ref> Thomas speculated that ''Oliver'' could represent Olvir Rosta; meaning that he was the progenitor of the Macaulays.<ref name="T1-364"/><ref>[[#M1|Mackenzie 1903]]: p. 64.</ref><ref name="G1-multiple">[[#G1|Gray 1922]]: pp. 59, 61<U+2013>62, 64, 72, 76, 148''n20''.</ref>

[[File:Leod, relevant pedigrees.svg|thumb|Several [[Gaelic-language]] pedigrees of the [[Clan MacLeod|MacLeods]] contain names which may be forms of the [[Old Norse]] ''<U+00D6>lvir''.]]

It has also been suggested that Olvir may be an ancestor of the [[Clan MacLeod|MacLeods]]. Until quite recently, it was commonly believed by historians that the [[eponymous]] ancestor of the MacLeods, [[Leod]], was the son of [[Olaf the Black]], King of Mann and the Isles. In the late 20th century, William Matheson proposed that the MacLeods descended in the male line from Olvir Rosta, rather than Olaf the Black. Matheson proposed that, within several Gaelic pedigrees which record ancestors of Leod, the great-grandfather of Leod has Gaelic names which very likely represent the Old Norse name ''<U+00D6>lvir''.<ref name="Matheson1">{{cite web |url=http://www.macleodgenealogy.org/Research/Matheson1.html |title=The Ancestry of the MacLeods |accessdate=January 16, 2010 |work=www.macleodgenealogy.org}} This webpage cited: {{cite journal |last=Matheson |first=William |title=The MacLeods of Lewis |journal=Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness |year=1978<U+2013>80 |volume=51 |location=[[Inverness]] |pages=pp. 68<U+2013>80}}</ref> These Gaelic names are considered to equate to other Gaelic names found within the early bardic poetry of the MacLeods.<ref name="ref-APMacLeod">{{cite web |url=http://www.macleodgenealogy.org/Research/APMacLeod.html |title=The Ancestry of Leod |accessdate=8 December 2009 |work=www.macleodgenealogy.org}} This webpage cited: {{cite journal |last=MacLeod |first=Andrew P. |year=2000 |title=The Ancestry of Leod |journal=Clan MacLeod Magazine |volume= |issue=91 }}</ref> About a century before, Thomas had noted the similarity in these names, when discussing Olvir, but he did not pursue a specific link between Olvir and the MacLeods.<ref name="ref-Sellar"/> Matheson speculated that Leod's great-grandfather would have flourished at roughly the same time as when Olvir is said to have fled to the ''Su<U+00F0>reyjar''. Matheson noted that Leod's name is derived from the Old Norse name ''Lj<U+00F3>tr'': a name which Matheson considered to be rare in [[Scandinavia]] and [[Iceland]], and even more so in Scotland. In consequence, he considered it significant that Olvir's maternal grandfather (Lj<U+00F3>tr 'Villain') also had this name. When comparing the relevant Gaelic pedigrees, Matheson noted that they were inconsistent in the generations preceding Leod's great-grandfather. In lieu of this, Matheson proposed that these inconsistencies may show that the Leod's great-grandfather was a newcomer to the Hebrides, like Olvir.<ref name="Matheson1"/> 

Later, historian [[David Sellar|W.D.H. Sellar]] noted Matheson's proposed link between the MacLeods and Olvir, but commented that the evidence Matheson used was entirely [[circumstantial evidence|circumstantial]]. Sellar was of the opinion that ''<U+00D6>lvir'' was not such a rare name as Matheson had previously thought. Sellar also noted that the genealogy and family of Olvir, recorded in the ''Orkneyinga saga'', has no similarity with the line recorded in the Gaelic genealogies concerning the ancestry of Leod.<ref name="ref-Sellar">{{cite web |url=http://www.macleodgenealogy.org/Research/Sellar.html |title=The Ancestry of the MacLeods Reconsidered |accessdate=8 December 2009 |work=www.macleodgenealogy.org}} This webpage cited: {{cite journal |last=Sellar |first=William David Hamilton |authorlink=David Sellar |year=1997<U+2013>1998 |title=The Ancestry of the MacLeods Reconsidered |journal=Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness |volume=60 |pages=pp. 233<U+2013>258 }}</ref> Matheson's association of Olvir to the Macleods was also attacked by clan historian Alick Morrison. Morrison commented that the name ''Ljotr'' was also not as rare as Matheson had proposed. Morrison noted that, in the previous century, Thomas had considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods<U+2014>this character was [[Lj<U+00F3>t<U+00F3>lfr]] (mentioned earlier in the article), who would have lived on Lewis about a century before Leod's time.<ref name="Morrison">{{cite web |url=http://www.macleodgenealogy.org/Research/Morrison.html |title=The Origin of Leod |accessdate=17 January 2010 |work=www.macleodgenealogy.org}} This webpage cited: {{cite book |title=The Chiefs of Clan MacLeod |last=Morrison |first=Alick |year=1986 |publisher=Associated Clan MacLeod Societies |location=[[Edinburgh]] |pages=1<U+2013>20 }}</ref><ref>[[#V1|Vigfusson 1887]]: pp. xxxvii<U+2013>xxxviii.</ref> In fact, Morrison did not consider Olvir's name<U+2014>and the singled-out Gaelic names<U+2014>to be anything but other forms of ''<U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fr''.<ref name="Morrison"/>{{#tag:ref|Morrison was convinced that [[Leod]] was the son of [[Olaf the Black]], and  thus ''not'' a male-line descendant of Olvir Rosta. Historically, the grandfather of Olaf the Black was <U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fr 'Titbit' (mentioned earlier in the article). To help bolster his argument that Olvir's name<U+2014>and the Gaelic names<U+2014>equate to ''<U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fr'', Morrison quoted an 18th century traditional account of Leod's father, which claimed the names were one-and-the-same: that "the father of Leod, the eponymous of the Clan MacLeod, was Olave, or Olgair, Olaus or Auleus, King of Man and the Isles".<ref name="Morrison"/>|group=note}} However, ''<U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fr'' and ''<U+00D6>lvir'' are considered by others to be quite different names, with separate origins.<ref name="ref-APMacLeod"/> Morrison, and Sellar, also noted that the bynames of Olvir, and Leod's great-grandfather, do not appear to match up<ref name="ref-Sellar"/><ref name="Morrison"/><U+2014>in three of the relevant Gaelic pedigrees, the byname of Leod's great-grandfather appears as ''snoice'', ''snaige'', and ''sn<U+00E1>ithe''.<ref name="ref-Sellar"/> Thomas considered these bynames to mean "hewer";<ref name="T1-364"/> although, both Matheson and Sellar disagreed with this translation.<ref name="Matheson1"/><ref name="ref-Sellar"/> Morrison considered these to equate to ''snaith'', "white";'<ref name="Morrison"/> however, Sellar noted that Morrison gave no further explanation for this assertion. Sellar, himself, proposed that the byname may be not be Gaelic, but Norse in origin. He suggested that it may refer to some sort of deformity to the man's nose; another suggestion forwarded to him was that it may refer to a [[cleft palate]].<ref name="ref-Sellar"/> Later, A.P. MacLeod noted that the Gaelic ''snatha''<U+2014>which has a secondary meaning of "grief", and "trouble"<ref>[[#D1|Dwelly 1902]]: p. 864.</ref><U+2014>may be a [[nominative]] form of the [[genitive]] ''snaithe'', and thus may equate to Olvir's byname.<ref name="ref-APMacLeod"/>

==Hebridean runes: possible family connections==
{{Contains Runic text|section}}
In 1962, on the [[Inner Hebridean]] island of [[Iona]], close to Reilig Odhrain {{gbmapping|NM22SE10}}, a fragment of a carved stone bearing the runic inscription of a man named ''<U+00D6>lvir'' was found.<ref name="canmore2"/> It is one of only three examples of rune-stones found in the west of Scotland.<ref name="G2-43">[[#G2|Graham-Campbell 1998]]: p. 43.</ref> This stone, in it's original form, would have measured {{convert|1.11|by|0.77|m|ft}}. The stone is decorated with a [[celtic cross|knotted cross]]; on the side, along the border, are Norse [[runes]]. The spelling of them suggests that they date to the late 10th or 11th centuries. The runes are thought to translate to: "Kali, son of <U+00D6>lvir, laid this stone over Fugl his brother".<ref name="canmore2">{{cite web |url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/129125/details/iona+iona+abbey+museum/ |title=Iona, Iona Abbey Museum |work=[[CANMORE]] |accessdate=1 April 2010 }}</ref> The men may have been part of a leading family in the Hebrides.
