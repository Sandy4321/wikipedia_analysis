'''State Road 874''' ('''SR 874'''), named the '''Don Shula Expressway''' for its length, is an [[open road tolling|electronic toll road]] in southern [[Miami-Dade County]], [[Florida]]. It extends {{convert|7|mi|km}} northeast from the [[Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike]] (HEFT) in southwestern [[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]] to the [[Florida State Road 826|Palmetto Expressway]] (SR 826) in [[Glenvar Heights, Florida|Glenvar Heights]], allowing traffic from the far south of Miami-Dade County and the [[Florida Keys]] to move to more central regions of metropolitan [[Miami]] and vice-versa, bypassing communities along [[U.S. Route 1 in Florida|U.S. Route 1]], while also permitting local access to the Kendall [[Census-designated place|district]]. The road, named in honor of the [[Don Shula|long-serving coach]] of the [[Miami Dolphins]] [[National Football League|NFL]] team, is maintained and tolled by the [[Miami-Dade Expressway Authority]] (MDX). Contrary to the [[State Roads in Florida#Numbering|numbering plan of Florida State Roads]], SR 874 is signed north<U+2013>south.

==Route description==
SR 874 begins at an interchange with the HEFT on the boundary of the [[Census-designated place|communities]] of [[Three Lakes, Florida|Three Lakes]], [[Richmond Heights, Florida|Richmond Heights]] and Kendall,<ref name="CensusMapFLMiDa99">{{cite map |url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/pl10map/cou_blk/st12_fl/c12086_miami-dade/PL10BLK_C12086_099.pdf |publisher=[[U.S. Census Bureau]] |title=P.L. 94-171 County Block Map (2010 Census): Miami-Dade County, FL |date=January 7, 2011 |cartography=Geography Division |at=Sheet 99 |format=PDF |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref> about {{convert|15|mi|km}} southwest of [[Downtown Miami]].<ref name="CensusMapFLMiDa">{{cite map |url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/pl10map/cou_blk/st12_fl/c12086_miami-dade/PL10BLK_C12086_000.pdf |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |title=P.L. 94-171 County Block Map (2010 Census): Miami-Dade County, FL |date=January 7, 2011 |cartography=Geography Division |at=Index Sheet |format=PDF |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref> The expressway is formed from the [[Median (road)|median]] lanes of the HEFT, and immediately turns to the northeast, passing under the HEFT's northbound lanes. Southbound HEFT traffic cannot access northbound SR 874; likewise, southbound SR 874 traffic cannot access the HEFT northbound. After turning to the northeast and entering Kendall, the six-laned Don Shula Expressway subsequently follows a [[CSX Transportation|CSX-owned]] railroad past predominantly residential neighborhoods for its entire route. SR 874 meets its first of three [[open road tolling|toll gantries]] about {{convert|1.4|mi|km}} north of its southern terminus, just north of its former lone toll plaza.<ref name="SLD" /><ref name="Google Maps">{{Google maps |url=https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!data=!1m4!1m3!1d121194!2d-80.3415318!3d25.6917208!4m23!3m20!1m5!1sDon+Shula+Expy%2C+Miami%2C+FL+33186%2C+USA!2s0x88d9c1424d60e1a9%3A0xc0ac7442f7fd822e!3m2!3d25.6448499!4d-80.3855052!1m4!3m2!3d25.7264149!4d-80.3181859!6e2!3m8!1m3!1d3786!2d-80.3167589!3d25.7264487!3m2!1i1440!2i809!4f13.1!7m1!6i1&fid=0 |title=Map of Florida State Road 874 |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref>

About {{convert/spell|2|mi|km}} from SR 874's southern terminus, the expressway interchanges with [[Florida State Road 990|Killian Parkway]] (SR 990) and [[Florida State Road 985|Southwest 107th Avenue]] (SR 985) at a [[partial cloverleaf interchange]]. The Don Shula Expressway continues on for {{convert|1.1|mi|km}}, passing through another toll gantry, before reaching an interchange with [[Florida State Road 94|Kendall Drive]] (SR 94). Almost immediately afterwards, SR 874 crosses the [[Snapper Creek]] Canal and enters the [[Sunset, Florida|Sunset]] [[Census-designated place|district]].<ref name="CensusMapFLMiDa85">{{cite map |url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/pl10map/cou_blk/st12_fl/c12086_miami-dade/PL10BLK_C12086_085.pdf |publisher=[[U.S. Census Bureau]] |title=P.L. 94-171 County Block Map (2010 Census): Miami-Dade County, FL |date=January 7, 2011 |cartography=Geography Division |at=Sheet 85 |format=PDF |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref> It then reaches the partial interchange with the [[Florida State Road 878|Snapper Creek Expressway]] (SR 878); indeed, southbound motorists along the Don Shula Expressway who wish to exit to Kendall Drive are directed onto the westernmost portion of SR 878. Once past the Snapper Creek Expressway, SR 874 features no interchanges for the remainder of its route. Just north of the bridge over [[Florida State Road 986|Sunset Drive]] (SR 986), about {{convert/spell|1/2|mi|m}} north of SR 878, motorists in both directions are provided with a separated lane to take their vehicles to if caught in an accident. {{convert/spell|1/4|mi|m|case=u}} past the accident investigation sites, the Don Shula Expressway swings north over the railroad, crossing over [[Florida State Road 973|Galloway Road]] (SR 973) in the process, and resumes its northeasterly orientation, now forming the boundary between the communities of [[Olympia Heights, Florida|Olympia Heights]], to the road's north, and [[Glenvar Heights, Florida|Glenvar Heights]], to the south.<ref name="CensusMapFLMiDa71">{{cite map |url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/pl10map/cou_blk/st12_fl/c12086_miami-dade/PL10BLK_C12086_071.pdf |publisher=[[U.S. Census Bureau]] |title=P.L. 94-171 County Block Map (2010 Census): Miami-Dade County, FL |date=January 7, 2011 |cartography=Geography Division |at=Sheet 71 |format=PDF |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref> {{convert|0.6|mi|m}} later, SR 874 passes through its third and final toll gantry, before reaching its northern terminus in a partial interchange with the [[Florida State Road 826|Palmetto Expressway]] after another {{convert/spell|1|mi|km}}. Like at its southern terminus, SR 874 forms the central lanes of SR 826 northbound; however, its interchange is integrated with SR 826's interchange with [[Florida State Road 976|Bird Road]] (SR 976). Also like its southern terminus, there is no access for northbound SR 874 or SR 826 traffic to the other route's southbound counterpart.<ref name="SLD" /><ref name="Google Maps" /><ref name="dademap">{{cite map |publisher=[[Florida Department of Transportation]] |title=General Highway Map Miami-Dade County, Florida |url=http://www.dot.state.fl.us/surveyingandmapping/geomap/mida_c.pdf |edition=May 2010 |year=April 2007 |cartography=Surveying and Mapping Office, State of Florida, Department of Transportation |format=PDF |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref>

==Tolls==
SR 874's tolls are entirely [[Electronic toll collection|electronic]]: cash cannot be accepted along its length. Payment is done either via [[SunPass]] transponders or via toll-by-plate billing, the latter of which attracts a higher cost. Three toll gantries are located along the Don Shula Expressway: the first between the HEFT and Killian Parkway, the second between Killian Parkway and Kendall Drive, and the last between the Snapper Creek and Palmetto Expressways. The relationship between the tolling points and interchanges along SR 874 and SR 878 is that all motorists are charged at least one toll for using the road; there are no "free sections".<ref name="tollcard">{{cite web |url=http://www.mdxort.com/pdf/1740_MDXRateCard_874-878.pdf |format=PDF |title=Welcome to Open Road Tolling: SR 874 Don Shula Expressway & SR 878 Snapper Creek Expressway |publisher=Miami-Dade Expressway Authority |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref> As of July 1, 2013, the cost for a two-axled vehicle to drive the entire length of SR 874 is $1.00 with a SunPass transponder, or $2.00 via the toll-by-plate program, with the two southern gantries charging $0.25 (SunPass) or $0.50 (toll-by-plate) each, and the northern one charging twice as much. Each additional axle on a vehicle attracts a surcharge equal to the cost of a two-axled vehicle for each gantry passed.<ref name="tollschedule">{{cite web |url=http://www.mdxway.com/pdf/Toll_Rate_Schedule.pdf |format= PDF |title=Toll Rate Schedule |publisher=[[Miami-Dade Expressway Authority]] |date=July 1, 2013 |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref>

==History==
The history of the Don Shula Expressway can be traced back to 1957 when, in planning for the [[Florida State Road 826|Palmetto Expressway]]'s routing, [[Miami-Dade County|Dade County]] Commissioner Ralph Fossey proposed an alternative southern alignment of the expressway to follow the then [[Seaboard Air Line Railroad|Seaboard-owned]] railroad southwest from near Miller Drive (Southwest 56th Avenue) to Southwest 117th Avenue, before heading south to US 1 at [[Goulds, Florida|Goulds]], instead of heading due south to Kendall.<ref name="fosseyplan">{{cite news |author=Verne O.

==Future==
As part of its long-term plans for the region, MDX is seeking to improve access to the Don Shula Expressway from its surrounding communities, particularly from the areas west of the HEFT.<ref name="MDXMasterPlan">{{cite web |title=Miami-Dade Expressway Authority Long-Range Master Transportation Plan |url=http://www.mdxway.com/pdf/strategic_plan/2035_LRMP_FINAL.pdf |publisher=Miami-Dade Expressway Authority |date=December 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2013}}</ref> Notably, MDX has launched a project to build exit and entry ramps from SR 874 into the Three Lakes district west of its southern terminus, aiming to relieve congestion at the Southwest 120th Street and [[Florida State Road 992|Coral Reef Drive]] (SR 992) interchanges with the HEFT by providing alternative access and egress of the area via SR 874. Studies to build the connection ran from 2010 until early 2012, in which six alternative routes for the ramps were suggested: the preferred route sees Southwest 128th Street widened east of Southwest 137th Avenue to four lanes, with [[Overpass|flyovers]] from east of Southwest 122nd Avenue, heading over the HEFT/SR 874 interchange, to merge with SR 874 east of Southwest 117th Avenue. Construction is set to begin in 2015, with completion sometime two years later.<ref name="874ramppublichearing">{{cite web |author=Tere C.

An additional project to improve connectivity with the Don Shula Expressway sees the construction of a partial [[diamond interchange]] between SR 874 and Sunset Drive (SR 986), so as to relieve congestion along SR 986 and improve access to the Sunset and neighboring districts. The interchange's ramps would permit movement only to and from SR 874 north of SR 986. MDX began preliminary studies of the project in 2009, but no timeline for construction has yet been published.<ref name="sunsetramp">{{cite web |author=Angela Marino |title=MDX SR 874/Don Shula Expressway <U+2013> Proposed Partial Interchange at SW 72nd Street (Sunset Drive) [Newsletter] |url=http://www.mdxway.com/pdf/future_projects/SR_874_Sunset_Interchange_Preliminary_Evaluation.pdf |publisher=Miami-Dade Expressway Authority |year=2011 |accessdate=October 2, 2013}}</ref>
