'''Predrag ''Pe<U+0111>a'' Mijatovi<U+0107>''' ([[Cyrillic]]: ''<U+041F><U+0440><U+0435><U+0434><U+0440><U+0430><U+0433> <U+041C><U+0438><U+0458><U+0430><U+0442><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+045B>'') (born [[January 19]], [[1969]] in [[Titograd]], [[Montenegro]], [[SFR Yugoslavia]]) is a former [[Serbian]] [[football (soccer)|football]] player and current sports director of [[Real Madrid]]. He is considered one of his country's best players of the 1990s. During his career his position on the pitch was striker.

On the club level, Mijatovi<U+0107> has played for 6 different clubs: [[FK Budu<U+0107>nost Podgorica|Budu<U+0107>nost Podgorica]], [[FK Partizan]], [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], [[Real Madrid]], [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], and [[Levante UD|Levante]]. Internationally, Mijatovi<U+0107> has been capped 73 times, scoring 28 goals (the appearances are split between the [[Yugoslavia national football team|SFR Yugoslavia]] and the [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|FR Yugoslavia]] national teams). He played in the [[Football World Cup 1998|1998 World Cup]] and [[2000 European Football Championship|Euro 2000]].

A very technically gifted player, Mijatovi<U+0107> is well remembered for scoring a goal for Real Madrid in the 1998 Champions' League final that brought the biggest European title back to Madrid after 32 years. He also had many memorable moments on the big stage, both on club and international levels. 

In 1995/1996 season for [[Valencia CF]], he scored 28 goals in [[La Liga|Primera Divisi<U+00F3>n]] which earned him a big-time move to [[Real Madrid]]. 
==Club career==
===FK Partizan===
In the summer of [[1989]], the talented 20-year-old was very close to signing with [[Hajduk Split]] before [[FK Partizan|Partizan]]'s president [[Mirko Marjanovi<U+0107>]] stepped in and convinced him to come to [[Belgrade]].

Mijatovi<U+0107>'s first season in Partizan was mostly spent settling into the new surroundings with only 1 goal in 15 league matches. The next 1990/91 season provided a bit of breakthrough as he became a prominent team member with 14 goals in 33 league appearances. However, the team's failure to win any silverware combined with [[Red Star Belgrade]]'s rampage through Yugoslav League and Europe meant that the entire Partizan team was in constant shadow of their crosstown rivals.

For his part, Mijatovi<U+0107> continued improving, becoming the team's undisputed leader during 1991/92 season under coach [[Ivica Osim]], and leading Partizan to 1992 Yugoslav Cup title over European Cup champions Red Star. He also picked up the Yugoslav Footballer of the Year award along the way.

Before the start of 1992/93 season [[SFR Yugoslavia]] disintegrated meaning that the new Yugoslav League consisted of teams from [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] only. Mijatovi<U+0107> put in another impressive season, helping Partizan finally overcome their Red Star jinx, and leading them to Yugoslav title.

Ever since he established himself at Partizan, Mijatovi<U+0107> had been linked with various top European sides - [[Real Madrid]], [[Atl<U+00E9>tico Madrid]] and [[Juventus]], among others. However, none of them expressed sufficient interest and he eventually ended up at [[Valencia CF]] in the summer of [[1993]]. Then Real president, [[Ram<U+00F3>n Mendoza]], later admitted that [[Robert Prosine<U+010D>ki]]'s failure to live up to expectations in Madrid made his club wary of young Yugoslavs.<small>[http://www.fifa.com/en/organisation/index/0,1521,6602,00.html?articleid=6602]</small>

===Valencia CF===
Mijatovi<U+0107> made his [[La Liga]] debut on [[September 5]], [[1993]] against [[Real Oviedo]] and immediately became an integral part of coach [[Guus Hiddink]]'s squad. He would go on to make 35 league appearances and score 16 goals in his debut season.

After steady progression he got the Spanish Footballer of the Year honours in 1995/96, season in which he led Valencia to second place La Liga finish with 28 goals in 40 league matches - a truly impressive tally considering he was often deployed as midfield creator.

The glowing performance didn't go unnoticed by the Spanish giants [[Real Madrid]] who, now under new club president [[Lorenzo Sanz]], started courting Mijatovi<U+0107> again after failing to commit to him three years earlier.

===Real Madrid===
Mijatovi<U+0107> finally arrived at the Spanish capital as a highly touted 27-year-old during the [[1996]] summer transfer window. At [[Real Madrid|Real]], playing in a slightly withdrawn forward/playmaker role, Mijatovi<U+0107> linked up with [[Davor <U+0160>uker]] (also freshly arrived from [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]]) to form a formidable strike partnership. Under manager [[Fabio Capello]], they both featured in all 38 league matches during 1996/97 season leading their team to [[Primera Liga]] title with Suker scoring 24, and Mijatovi<U+0107> 14 goals while also laying on many others.

Though the following, 1997/98 season at Real wasn't quite as successful for Mijatovi<U+0107> from personal standpoint, it still provided many memorable moments. Despite injuries and somewhat inconsistent form, he still managed 10 goals in 24 league games, linking up well with emerging 21-year-old forward [[Fernando Morientes]] who arrived from [[Real Zaragoza]] at the beginning of the season and all but squeezed <U+0160>uker out of the squad by the end of it. And even though [[FC Barcelona]] led by, among others, [[Sonny Anderson]], [[Lu<U+00ED>s Figo]], and [[Lu<U+00ED>s Enrique Mart<U+00ED>nez Garc<U+00ED>a|Lu<U+00ED>s Enrique]] beat them to the league title, the season was still deemed a success since the elusive [[UEFA Champions League 1997-98|European trophy]] was finally back at Bernabeu after a 32-year wait. Real beat [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in May 1998 in [[Amsterdam]]'s ArenA with Mijatovi<U+0107> scoring the only goal - incidentally his first of that year's Champions League.

However, after being on top of the world in May, Mijatovi<U+0107> came back to Real Madrid in August with lukewarm feelings due to his poor showing at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]]. The following 1998/99 season turned out to be his last with the ''royal'' club. Despite winning the Champions League trophy, coach [[Jupp Heynckes]]' contract was not extended. The new coaching set-up employed by first [[Jos<U+00E9> Antonio Camacho]] and subsequently [[Guus Hiddink]] often used Mijatovi<U+0107> out of position on the wing, while [[Ra<U+00FA>l]] and [[Fernando Morientes|Morientes]] were the preferred attacking duo most of the time. Though at moments he displayed old brilliance, his performance was much too streaky and inconsistent for a club of Real's stature. Even when Hiddink got fired mid-season, it still didn't spell the start of better days for Mijatovi<U+0107>, as he openly feuded with new coach [[John Toshack]]. After going out in [[UEFA Champions League 1998-99|Champions League quarterfinals]] to [[Andriy Shevchenko|Shevchenko]]-led [[Dynamo Kyiv]] (incidentaly, 2 matches where Mijatovi<U+0107> played some excellent football) and failing to win the [[Primera Liga|league]] for the second season in a row, changes were clearly in order especially knowing the triggerhappy nature of Real brass. They were getting ready to clear the space upfront for promising 20-year-old [[Nicolas Anelka]] from [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] to be brought in. The management decided that the best days of now 30-year-old Mijatovi<U+0107> were behind him and sold him to [[Fiorentina]] at the end of the season.

===Fiorentina===
In [[Florence]] Mijatovi<U+0107> played under coach [[Giovanni Trapattoni]], with [[Gabriel Batistuta]] and [[Enrico Chiesa]] providing competition for places upfront. Fortunately for all three, Trapattoni favoured an attacking formation that season, allowing each forward his share of playing time. This also meant Mijatovi<U+0107> dropped further into midfield which was a role he quickly adopted to.

==National team==
Simultaneously with Mijatovi<U+0107>'s transfer from [[Valencia CF]] to [[Real Madrid]], [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|Yugoslavia]] returned to playing competitive matches after a 4 year ban due to the UN embargo. Naturally, Mijatovi<U+0107>, by this time a bone fide European football star, played a prominent role for [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|Yugoslavia]] as well. Playing in the pure attacking role for his country, he was seemingly scoring at will. In late 1997, during the 2-game World Cup playoff qualifiers against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], he notched 7 goals (hat-trick in the first leg in [[Budapest]] and 4 goals in the return home leg at ''[[Stadion Crvena Zvezda|Marakana]]''). [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|Yugoslavia]] demolished their opposition 12-1 on aggregate and qualified for the [[Football World Cup 1998|1998 World Cup]] in France. 

===World Cup 1998===
The expectations in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|France 98]] were undoubtedly substantial. In many circles Yugoslavia was considered to be the tournament's dark horse as a team full of players with prominent roles in top European clubs. Now 29 years of age, Mijatovi<U+0107>, arguably the squad's biggest star was in the prime of his career and also heading into the tournament on a high from his Champions League final success. Furthermore, with 14 qualifying campaign goals to his name, he was expected to provide most of the scoring punch. He himself beamed with confidence, even cautiously suggesting Yugoslavia will go far in the tournament. 

However, he performed way below expectations, managing to score only one goal in 4 matches - a fluky effort during group phase match against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] that was awarded to him only after further video examination because at first it seemed like [[Dejan Stankovi<U+0107>]] provided the final touch to put the ball in the net. To compound his subpar performance, Mijatovi<U+0107> slammed a crucial penalty against the crossbar in the round-of-16 elimination game against [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] that Yugoslavia subsequently lost to injury time goal by [[Edgar Davids]].

==Post-football==
After retiring in [[2004]], Mijatovi<U+0107> continued living in Valencia and soon became a player agent.

In June [[2006]], he hooked up with [[Ram<U+00F3>n Calder<U+00F3>n]] as part of his candidate bid for the position of [[Real Madrid]] president. When Calder<U+00F3>n won the closely contested club election on [[July 2]], [[2006]], Mijatovi<U+0107> became Real's new sporting director.

==Personal==
Mijatovi<U+0107>'s personal life has also been well publicized due to his turbulent relationship with Belgrade socialite Elena Karaman. They were married for 1<U+00BD> years during the early 1990s, and had two sons before divorcing. During the divorce proceedings, he often wore a [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] baseball cap with the initials "L.A.", dedicated to their sons Luka and Andreja.

He was involved in several high-profile protests against the NATO bombing campaign of his home country. He was fined over 5 million pesetas by [[Real Madrid]] after refusing to play against [[Deportivo Alav<U+00E9>s|Alav<U+00E9>s]] in April 1999.

In the years following his divorce, Mijatovi<U+0107> got remarried to fashion model Aneta Mili<U+0107>evi<U+0107>. The couple has three daughters: Na<U+0111>a (born 1999), Nina, and Lola.

Since becoming [[Real Madrid]] football director, Mijatovi<U+0107> lives in [[Madrid]].
