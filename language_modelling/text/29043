[[File:Brighton railway works.jpg|thumb|250px|The works in 1846 (detail from an engraving of [[London Road viaduct]]).]]
'''Brighton railway works''' was one of the earliest railway-owned locomotive repair works, founded in 1840 by the [[London and Brighton Railway]] in [[Brighton]], England, and thus pre-dating the more famous railway works at [[Crewe Works|Crewe]], [[Doncaster Works|Doncaster]] and [[Swindon Works|Swindon]]. The works grew steadily between 1841 and 1900 but efficient operation was always hampered by the restricted site, and there were several plans to close it and move the facility elsewhere. Nevertheless between 1852 and 1957 more than 1200 [[steam locomotive]]s as well as prototype [[diesel electric locomotive|diesel electric]] and [[electric locomotive]]s were constructed there, before the eventual closure of the facility in 1962.

After use as a factory for constructing [[bubble car]]s, the facility was demolished and has since been redeveloped as part of the [[New England Quarter]] of Brighton.

== London and Brighton Railway ==

The earliest locomotive servicing facility at Brighton was a small engine shed to the north-west of the station, serving the [[West Coastway Line|Brighton <U+2013> Shoreham line]] of the London and Brighton Railway in May 1840.<ref>{{cite book | last = Griffiths | first = Roger & Smith, Paul | title = The directory of British engine sheds and principal locomotive servicing points: 1 Southern England, the Midlands, East Anglia and Wales | publisher = Oxford Publishing Co.| year = 1999 | pages = 69 | isbn = }}</ref> The following year, with the completion of the [[Brighton main line|London <U+2013> Brighton main line]], the railway opened a larger repair facility and [[motive power depot]] on the eastern side of the main line adjacent to the [[Brighton railway station]]. However a new workshop at [[Horley railway station|Horley]], midway between London and Brighton, also opened in 1841, was then planned to become the principal locomotive and carriage workshop of the new railway.<ref>Griffiths (1999), pp. 79</ref>

==London Brighton and South Coast Railway==

Following his appointment as the Locomotive Superintendent of the successor company, the [[London Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LB&SCR) in November 1847, [[John Chester Craven]] changed the plan of moving the works to Horley. Carriage construction began in 1848, having previously been carried out by contractors at New Cross.<ref>Gray (1977), p.123.</ref> Craven also set about enlarging and equipping Brighton works for new steam locomotive construction, which began in May 1852. However the situation of the works, close to the main line, on top of a cliff, in what would soon become a built-up area, always imposed restrictions on the space available for its efficient operation.

===Expansion 1860<U+2013>1900===

During 1860 and 1861 Craven began the removal of a large chalk hill on the western side of the main line, which had been dumped during the construction of the main line. The space created was used to accommodate a new much enlarged motive power depot in 1861, thereby permitting the closure of the existing facilities and their incorporation into the works proper.<ref>{{cite book | last = Cooper | first = B.K. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Rail Centres: Brighton | publisher = Ian Allan | year = 1981 | location = London | pages = 58 | url =  | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7110-1155-9}}</ref><ref>Griffiths (1999), pp.69</ref> Nevertheless, by 1866 consideration was again being given to concentrating repairs at [[New Cross Gate railway station]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Marshall | first = C.F. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = History of the Southern Railway | publisher = Ian Allan | year = 1963 | location = London | pages = 442 | url =  | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7110-0059-X}}</ref>

In the 1870s [[William Stroudley]] considered moving the works to the site at Horley once again, but instead moved the carriage repair shed and paint shops to new sites on the western side of the main line, and transferred the marine engineering work undertaken by the works to a new facility in [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Cooper | first = B.K. | title = Rail Centres: Brighton | publisher = Ian Allan | year = 1981 | location = London | pages = 58 | isbn = 0-7110-1155-9}}</ref> This allowed for the further enlargement of the locomotive building and repair facilities, including the addition of an iron foundry in 1873, and a new carriage painting and cleaning shop in 1878, and a coppersmith's shop in 1881.<ref>{{Cite book| last= Robertson| first= Kevin| year=2004 | title= London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Miscellany| publisher=Oxford Publishing | isbn= 0-86093-583-3}} 44.</ref><ref>Marshall (1963), p.443.</ref> This new construction solved the problem for a while, but did not address the underlying issue of the inadequate site so that by the end of the century the works was again suffering from serious difficulties affecting its efficient operation.

===Crisis at Brighton===

From 1905 Brighton works was unable to keep pace with the locomotives requiring to be serviced, and backlogs began to build up. As a result the LB&SCR established concentrations of locomotives awaiting entry to the works or else scrapping at [[East Grinstead railway station|East Grinstead]], [[Horsted Keynes railway station|Horsted Keynes]] and [[Horley railway station|Horley]]. An outside investigation in 1908, conducted by [[Robert Urie]], then Works Manager of [[Nine Elms Locomotive Works|Nine Elms Works]] found 108 of the LB&SCR's 541 locomotives (20%) were awaiting or under repair, and that a general overhaul at Brighton took 43 days, compared with 7.2% of the locomotives of the [[South Eastern and Chatham Railway]] under repair and 21 days taken by [[Ashford Works]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Aves | first = W.A.T. | title = The Locomotives built at the Southern Railway Works, 2 <U+2013> Brighton, Part 1 1871<U+2013>1906 | journal = Locomotives Illustrated | issue = 159 | pages = 5<U+2013>6 | publisher = Ian Allan Publ. | year = 2005 | issn = 0307-1804}}
</ref> By 1910 30% of the locomotive stock was unusable due to delays and inefficiencies at Brighton works.<ref>{{cite book| last = Marx | first = Klaus | title = Lawson Billinton: a career cut short | publisher = Oakwood Press | year = 2007 | location = Usk | pages = 9 | isbn = 978-0-85361-661-0}}</ref>

[[L.B. Billinton|Lawson Billinton]], the District Locomotive Superintendent at [[New Cross Gate railway station|New Cross depot]] had sought to alleviate the situation by executing repairs and boiler changes, but this had little impact on the problem. The LB&SCR Locomotive, Carriage and Wagon Superintendent [[D.E. Marsh]] received much of the blame for the problem, which had been developing for some years, and he was granted leave of absence due to sickness in 1910, followed by his resignation in July 1911. Billinton had been invited to take over on a temporary basis during Marsh's sickness, and promptly set about re-organising the works and reducing the backlog by using emerging [[Time and motion study]] techniques.<ref>Marx, (2007), pp.9<U+2013>10.</ref>

===Plans to move the works===

The LB&SCR directors recognised that part of the problem at Brighton was that the works was overwhelmed with work. In 1910 they purchased land at [[Lancing Carriage Works|Lancing]] for a new carriage and wagon works, which was opened in 1912. This allowed Stroudley's carriage shed to be used as an overflow 'stock shed' by the locomotive works and the motive power depot. Locomotives repaired at Brighton were also sometimes taken to Lancing for their final painting.

Once confirmed in his post as Locomotive Superintendent in 1913 Billinton presented proposals to the LB&SCR board to close Brighton works and concentrate all locomotive building and repair at a new facility adjacent to the carriage works at [[Lancing, West Sussex|Lancing]]. However the advent of the [[First World War]] in 1914 put an end to this plan.

Locomotive building was severely curtailed at Brighton after 1916 and the works became involved in munitions production. After the war there was again a substantial backlog of repairs and new construction did not resume until late 1920.

==Grouping & impending closure==

Following the [[Railways Act 1921|grouping]] of the LB&SCR and other railways in southern England to form the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]], in 1923, much of the new locomotive construction for the new railway was transferred to the more modern facilities at [[Eastleigh Works]]. After mid-1931, with the impending electrification of the [[Brighton main line]], the locomotive works once again seemed likely to close. Many of the skilled workmen and much of the equipment were transferred to [[Eastleigh Works|Eastleigh]] and [[Ashford railway works|Ashford]], the Paint Shop was converted into an [[Electric multiple unit]] maintenance facility,<ref>Cooper (1981), pp. 86</ref> and the former carriage shed was converted for use by the Southern Railway's new Road Motor Engineers Department. Similarly the steam motive power depot was rebuilt and reduced in size.<ref>Cooper (1981), pp. 58.</ref>

===The Second World War and Revival===

Fears of possible air attacks on Ashford and Eastleigh together with the need for more steam locomotive and armaments construction during [[World War II]] brought about the re-opening and re-equipment of the workshops in 1941. Throughout the remaining years of the war Brighton works was used for locomotive construction, initially for the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]], but also later for the [[War Department (UK)|War Department]], the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] and the [[London and North Eastern Railway]]. It also manufactured component parts for tanks and anti-aircraft guns.<ref>{{cite book | last = Larkin | first = Edgar  | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = An illustrated history of British Railway Workshops | publisher = Oxford Publishing Co. | year = 1992| location = Oxford| pages = 33 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-86093-503-5}}</ref> The workshops were damaged during the "[[Brighton Blitz]]" in May 1943 but soon repaired.

==British Railways and closure==

In the decade after the [[nationalisation]] of [[British Rail]]ways(BR) in 1948 Brighton works was again used for new locomotive construction, being responsible for both design work and construction of several of the new BR Standard classes. At the time of the centenary of locomotive building in 1952 the works covered {{convert|9|acre|m2}} and employed about 650 staff.<ref>Cooper (1981), p. 65</ref> However, under the modernisation plan for BR announced in 1954, Brighton Works was once again passed over. Locomotive building ceased in 1957, and locomotive repairs ceased the following year. The buildings were closed in 1962 and demolished in 1969. The motive power depot was officially closed 15 June 1961, but remained in use for stabling steam locomotives until 1964, and was demolished in 1966.

== Later uses of the site ==
After the closure of the main works, part of the workshop was used for the building of [[Isetta]] microcars between 1957 and 1964 and some of the land remained in railway use, associated with the stabling of [[electric multiple unit]] trains and other maintenance functions. Much of the land later became a large open car park, and was used for a popular market every Sunday morning. Some land on the eastern side was given over to an assortment of retail units including a number of car dealers with temporary structures being the predominant building type, and a strip below the yard was used for retail premises; behind these remained the stone and brick columns over which the yard had been extended when space was at a premium. Much of the land which was not suitable for use either by lock-up traders or for car parking or still in use by British Rail was left derelict. The final traces of the locomotive works vanished with the demolition of the elevated 1930s Southern Railway signal box in the mid-1980s, the signal box having used part of the main locomotive erecting-shop wall as support.

In the early years of the 21st Century the site has finally seen redevelopment begin, and it lies at the heart of the [[New England Quarter]].

== Locomotive construction at Brighton ==

The first locomotive to be constructed at Brighton was a [[2-2-2]], No.14.<ref name="Larkin 1992, pp. 33">Larkin (1992), pp. 33</ref> Thereafter Brighton works was responsible for the design and construction of a large proportion of the locomotives operated by the LB&SCR under the engineers [[John Chester Craven|Craven]], [[William Stroudley]], [[R. J. Billinton]], [[D. E. Marsh]] and [[L. B. Billinton]].

===London Brighton and South Coast Railway===
Notable locomotive types constructed at Brighton included the [[LB&SCR A1 Class|A1 "Terrier" class]], awarded a Gold medal at the 1870 Paris Exhibition, the [[LB&SCR B1 Class|B1]] "Gladstone" class [[0-4-2]] (awarded a Gold medal at the 1889 [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Paris Exhibition]]), the [[LB&SCR D1 class|D1]] 0-4-2T, the Billinton [[LB&SCR B4 class|B4]] [[4-4-0]], and [[LB&SCR D3 class|D3]] [[0-4-4]]T classes, the Marsh [[LB&SCR H2 class|H2 class]] [[4-4-2 (locomotive)|4-4-2]], and [[LB&SCR L Class|L Class]] [[4-6-4]]T. Locomotive building at Brighton ceased at the end of 1916 with the building of the last [[LB&SCR E2 class|E2]] [[0-6-0]] tank, and five [[LB&SCR K Class|K]] class [[2-6-0]], and did not resume until late 1920, with further members of the K and L classes. The last locomotive to be built at the works by the LB&SCR was L class No. 333 ''Remembrance''.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Aves | first = W.A.T. | title = The Locomotives built at the Southern Railway Works, 2 <U+2013> Brighton 1906<U+2013>1957 | journal = Locomotives Illustrated | issue = 163 | pages = 3<U+2013>47 | publisher = Ian Allan Publ. | year = 2006 | issn = 0307-1804 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

===Southern Railway===
For the first three years of [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] ownership no new locomotives were built at Brighton, although rebuilding of the B4 class into virtually new locomotives took place. During 1926 the works was responsible for building ten examples of [[Richard Maunsell|Maunsell's]] [[Southern Railway U Class|"River class"]] and then rebuilding of six of them into [[Southern Railway U Class|"U class"]] [[2-6-0]] tender locomotives two years later. The works also built a further ten "U" class in 1928. The following year the works constructed all of the designer's [[SR Z class|Z class]] [[0-8-0]]T locomotives, before locomotive construction again ceased.

During the war years Brighton works built more than half of [[Oliver Bulleid|Bulleid's]] [[SR Class Q1|Q1 class]] 0-6-0 freight locomotives, and the drawing office was primarily responsible for the detailed designs of his revolutionary [[SR Merchant Navy Class|Merchant Navy]] [[4-6-2]] express passenger locomotives, although the locomotives were built at [[Eastleigh|Eastleigh Works]]. From 1943 they built 93 of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]] [[William Stanier|Stanier]] type [[2-8-0]] freight locomotives for the [[War Department (UK)|War Department]], at the incredible rate of one every 4.5 days.<ref name="Larkin 1992, pp. 33" />

The heyday of locomotive building at the works was during the decade after the war, when Brighton built more than 100 [[Oliver Bulleid|Bulleid]] light pacifics of the [[SR West Country class|West Country]] and [[SR Battle of Britain class|Battle of Britain]] classes. The works also constructed the boilers and tenders for the final batch of ten Merchant Navy class, although the locomotives were constructed at Eastleigh.<ref>Bradley (1976), pp.26<U+2013>7</ref> The thousandth locomotive to be constructed at the works was 21C164 "Fighter Command" in June 1947.<ref>Bradley (1976), p. 60.</ref> This figure did not take into account 12 [[LB&SCR B4 class|B4X class]] [[4-4-0]] from 1922<U+2013>24 which were officially classified as rebuilds rather than new locomotives.

===British Railways===
[[File:Leader at Brighton.jpg|thumb|250px|The Leader being lifted onto its power bogies at Brighton, May 1949.]]
During the early years of [[British Railways]] Brighton works constructed two further batches of "West Country" pacifics and would have been responsible for the entire class of 110 locomotives, had not the works become overstretched due to its involvement in the design and construction of [[Oliver Bulleid|Bulleid's]] problematic and ultimately ill-fated [[SR Leader class|Leader class]] in 1949. Thereafter it was responsible for building 41 examples of the [[LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T]] for use on the Southern Region.

In addition to the Leader class, other prototype locomotives constructed at Brighton included the third [[3rd rail]] [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] [[electric locomotive]], [[British Rail Class 70 (electric)|numbered 20003]] in 1948, and the third [[1Co-Co1]] [[diesel electric locomotive]] [[British Rail Class D16/2|numbered 10203]] in 1954.

Brighton staff were involved in the design of three of the most successful BR standard classes <U+2013> the [[BR standard class 4 4-6-0|class 4 4-6-0 tender]], and [[BR standard class 4 tank|class 4 2-6-4 tank]] classes together with the [[BR standard class 9F|9F]] 2-10-0 class <U+2013> and the works built 130 examples of the class 4 tank locomotives after 1951. New locomotive construction ceased in 1957 with the construction of [[BR standard class 4 tank]] 80154, which was the 1,211th locomotive to be constructed there.

==Other engineering work undertaken at Brighton works==
As mentioned above, the works undertook marine engineering for the railway until the mid-1870s and carriage construction until the opening of [[Lancing Carriage Works]]. In addition it constructed [[Turntable (rail)|turntable]]s and other heavy equipment for the railway.
