{{Islam}}

A '''mosque''' ({{IPAc-en|m|<U+0252>|s|k}}; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]:<U+0645><U+0633><U+062C><U+062F> ''masjid'' pl. <U+0645><U+0633><U+0627><U+062C><U+062F> ''mas<U+0101>jid''), sometimes spelt '''[[wikt:mosk|mosk]]''', is a [[place of worship]] for followers of [[Islam]].

There are strict and detailed requirements in [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] ''[[fiqh]]'' for a place of worship to be considered a mosque, with places that do not meet these requirements regarded as ''[[Jama'at Khana|musallas]]''.<ref name="qaSunniPathFiqhMasjid">{{cite web|url=http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&ID=4347&CATE=4 |title=Fiqh of Masjid & Musalla |publisher=Qa.sunnipath.com |date=2005-07-03 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}</ref> There are stringent restrictions on the uses of the area formally demarcated as the mosque (which is often a small portion of the larger complex), and, in the Islamic ''[[Sharia]]'' law, after an area is formally designated as a mosque, it remains so until the [[Islamic view of the Last Judgment|Last Day]].<ref name="qaSunniPathFiqhMasjid"/>

[[Quba Mosque]] in [[Medina]], [[Saudi Arabia]] is the oldest mosque in the world. Many mosques have elaborate [[dome]]s, [[minaret]]s, and prayer halls, in varying styles of architecture. Mosques originated on the [[Arabian Peninsula]], but are now found in all inhabited continents. The mosque serves as a place where [[Muslim]]s can come together for ''[[salat]]'' (prayer) ({{lang-ar|<U+0635><U+0644><U+0627><U+0629>}}, ''<U+1E63>al<U+0101>t'') as well as a center for information, education, and dispute settlement. The [[imam]] leads the congregation in prayer.

== Etymology ==
The word entered [[English language|English]] from a [[French language|French]] word which probably derived from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''moschea'', a variant of Italian ''moscheta'', from either [[Armenian language|Armenian]] <U+0574><U+0566><U+056F><U+056B><U+0569> (''mzki<U+1E6D>'') or [[Medieval Greek|Greek]] <U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03B3><U+03AF><U+03B4><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03BD> (''masg<U+00ED>dion'') or Spanish ''mesquita'', from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] <U+0645><U+0633><U+062C><U+062F> (''masjid''), meaning "place of worship" or "prostration in prayer", either from [[Nabataean language|Nabataean]] ''masg<sup><U+0115></sup>dh<U+0101><U+0301>'' or from Arabic <U+0633><U+062C><U+062F> (''sajada)'', meaning "to bow down in prayer" or "worship", probably ultimately from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] ''s<sup><U+0115></sup>gh<U+0113>dh''.<ref>For the word's origin from French and probable origin from Italian ''moscheta'', see "mosque, n.".

==History==
[[File:Supplicating Pilgrim at Masjid Al Haram. Mecca, Saudi Arabia.jpg|thumb|The [[Masjid al-Haram]] was one of the first mosques, and today is considered the holiest site in Islam]]
[[File:Kairouan Mosque Stitched Panorama.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]], in Tunisia, is the oldest mosque in the Muslim West.]]
The first mosque in the world is often considered to be the area around the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] now known as the [[Masjid al-Haram]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kuban|1974|p=1}}</ref> Since as early as 638 AD, the Masjid al-Haram has been expanded on several occasions to accommodate the increasing number of Muslims who either live in the area or make the annual pilgrimage known as ''[[hajj]]'' to the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Dumper|Stanley|2007|p=241}}</ref> Others regard the first mosque in history to be the [[Quba Mosque]] in present-day [[Medina]] since it was the first structure built by [[Mahammad]] upon his [[Hijra (Islam)|emigration from Mecca]] in 622.<ref>{{harvnb|Tajuddin|1998|p=135}}</ref>

Muhammad went on to establish another mosque in Medina, which is now known as the [[Masjid an-Nabawi]], or the Prophet's Mosque. Built on the site of his home, Muhammad participated in the construction of the mosque himself and helped pioneer the concept of the mosque as the focal point of the Islamic city.<ref name="chiu678">{{harvnb|Chiu|2010|pp=67<U+2013>8}}</ref> The Masjid al-Nabawi introduced some of the features still common in today's mosques, including the niche at the front of the prayer space known as the ''[[mihrab]]'' and the tiered pulpit called the ''[[minbar]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Cosman|Jones|2008|p=610}}</ref> The Masjid al-Nabawi was also constructed with a large courtyard, a motif common among mosques built since then.<ref name="chiu678" />

===Diffusion and evolution===
Mosques had been built in [[Iraq]] and [[North Africa]] by the end of the 7th century, as Islam spread outside the Arabian Peninsula with early [[caliphate]]s. The [[Imam Husayn Shrine]] in [[Karbala]] is one of the oldest mosques in Iraq, although its present form<U+2014>typical of [[Persian architecture]]<U+2014>only goes back to the 11th century. The shrine, while still operating as a mosque, remains one of the holiest sites for [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]], as it honors the death of the third [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Shia imam]], [[Hussein ibn Ali]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bellows|2008|p=249}}</ref> The [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As]] was the first mosque in [[Egypt]], serving as a religious and social center for [[Fustat]] (present-day [[Cairo]]) during its prime. Like the Imam Husayn Shrine, though, nothing of its original structure remains.<ref>{{harvnb|Netton|1996|p=149}}</ref> With the later [[Fatimid Caliphate]], mosques throughout Egypt evolved to include schools (known as ''[[madrasa]]s''), hospitals, and tombs.<ref>{{harvnb|Budge|2001|pp=123<U+2013>8}}</ref>

[[File:1 great mosque xian 2011.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Great Mosque of Xi'an]] incorporates traditional elements of [[Chinese architecture]].]]
The [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in present-day [[Tunisia]] was the first mosque built in northwest Africa, with its present form (dating from the 9th century) serving as a model for other Islamic places of worship in the [[Maghreb]]. It was the first to incorporate a square [[minaret]] (as opposed to the more common circular minaret) and includes [[nave]]s akin to a [[basilica]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=1287&lang=en | publisher=The Qantara Project | title=Minaret of the Great Mosque of Kairouan | year=2008 | accessdate=5 October 2013}}</ref><ref name="elleh114">{{harvnb|Elleh|2002|pp=114<U+2013>5}}</ref> Those features can also be found in [[Andalusia]]n mosques, including the [[Grand Mosque of Cordoba]], as they tended to reflect the architecture of the [[Moors]] instead of their [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] predecessors.<ref name="elleh114" /> Still, some elements of [[Visigothic architecture]], like [[horseshoe arch]]es, were infused into the mosque architecture of Spain and the Maghreb.<ref>{{harvnb|Ruggles|2002|p=38}}</ref>

The first mosque in East Asia was established in the 8th century in [[Xi'an]]. However, the [[Great Mosque of Xi'an]], whose current building dates from the 18th century, does not replicate the features often associated with mosques elsewhere.<ref name="cow30">{{harvnb|Cowen|1985|pp=30<U+2013>5}}</ref> Indeed, minarets were initially prohibited by the state.<ref name="ahm109">{{harvnb|Ahmed|2002|p=109}}</ref> Following traditional [[Chinese architecture]], the Great Mosque of Xi'an, like many other mosques in eastern China, resembles a [[pagoda]], with a green roof instead of the yellow roof common on imperial structures in China. Mosques in western China were more likely to incorporate elements, like domes and minarets, traditionally seen in mosques elsewhere.<ref name="cow30" />

A similar integration of foreign and local influences could be seen on the [[Indonesia]]n islands of [[Sumatra]] and [[Java]], where mosques, including the [[Demak Great Mosque]], were first established in the 15th century.<ref name="blobla439">{{harvnb|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=439}}</ref> Early Javanese mosques took design cues from [[Hindu temple architecture|Hindu]], [[Buddhist architecture|Buddhist]], and Chinese architectural influences, with tall timber, multi-level roofs similar to the pagodas of [[Balinese temple|Balinese Hindu temples]]; the ubiquitous Islamic dome did not appear in Indonesia until the 19th century.<ref name="ahm109" /><ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=281}}</ref> In turn, the Javanese style influenced the styles of mosques in Indonesia's [[Austronesia]]n neighbors<U+2014>[[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], and the [[Philippines]].<ref name="blobla439" />

[[File:Jama Masjid, Delhi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] in Delhi remains India's largest mosque and a classic example of the Mughal style of architecture.]]
Muslim empires were instrumental in the evolution and spread of mosques. Although mosques were first established in India during the 7th century, they were not commonplace across [[Indian subcontinent|the subcontinent]] until the arrival of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in the 16th and 17th centuries. Reflecting their [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] origins, [[Mughal architecture|Mughal-style]] mosques included [[onion dome]]s, [[ogee|pointed arches]], and elaborate circular minarets, features common in the [[Persian architecture|Persian]] and [[Architecture of Central Asia|Central Asian styles]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=182}}</ref> The [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] in [[Delhi]] and the [[Badshahi Mosque]] in [[Lahore]], built in a similar manner in the mid-17th century,<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=187}}</ref> remain two of the largest mosques on the Indian subcontinent.<ref>{{harvnb|Asher|1992|p=202}}</ref>

The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] was particularly instrumental in spreading Islam and establishing mosques within the [[Levant]], as the Umayyads constructed among the most revered mosques in the region<U+2014>the [[al-Aqsa Mosque]] and [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kuban|1985|p=27}}</ref> The designs of the Dome of the Rock and the Umayyad Mosque were influenced by [[Byzantine architecture]], a trend that continued with the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>{{harvnb|Flood|2001|pp=101<U+2013>3}}</ref> Several of the early mosques in the Ottoman Empire were originally churches or cathedrals from the [[Byzantine Empire]], with the [[Hagia Sophia]] (one of those converted cathedrals) informing the architecture of mosques from after the [[fall of Constantinople|Ottoman conquest of Constantinople]].<ref>{{harvnb|Essa|Ali|2010|pp=230<U+2013>1}}</ref> Still, the Ottomans developed [[Ottoman architecture|their own architectural style]] characterized by large central rotundas (sometimes surrounded by multiple smaller domes), pencil-shaped minarets, and open [[facade]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Essa|Ali|2010|pp=231<U+2013>2}}</ref>

[[File:Shah Jahan Mosque TQ0159 214.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Shah Jahan Mosque, Woking|Shah Jahan Mosque]], built in 1889, was the first mosque in the United Kingdom; today, the country has more than 1500.<ref>{{harvnb|Nielsen|Akg<U+00F6>n<U+00FC>l|Aliba<U+0161>i<U+0107>|Goddard|Mar<U+00E9>chal|2011|p=603}}</ref><ref name="blobla193" />]]
Mosques from the Ottoman period are still scattered across Eastern Europe, but the most rapid growth in the number of mosques in Europe has occurred within the past century as more Muslims have migrated to the continent. Many major European cities are home to mosques, like the [[Grand Mosque of Paris]], that incorporate domes, minarets, and other features often found with mosques in Muslim-majority countries.<ref name="blobla193">{{harvnb|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=193}}</ref> The first mosque in North America was founded by [[Albanian American]]s in 1915, but the continent's oldest surviving mosque, the [[Mother Mosque of America]], only dates back to the 1930s.<ref>{{harvnb|Nimer|2002|pp=39<U+2013>40}}</ref> As in Europe, the number of American mosques has rapidly increased in recent decades as Muslim immigrants, particularly from South Asia, have come in the United States. Greater than forty percent of mosques in the United States were constructed after 2000.<ref>{{cite web | last=Grossman | first=Cathy Lynn | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/religion/story/2012-02-29/islamic-worship-growth-us/53298792/1 | publisher=USA Today | title=Number of U.S. mosques up 74% since 2000 | date=29 February 2012 | accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref>

===Conversion of places of worship===
{{Main|Conversion of non-Muslim places of worship into mosques}}
According to early [[List of Muslim historians|Muslim historians]], towns that surrendered without resistance and made treaties with the Muslims gave the Muslims permission to take their churches and [[synagogue]]s. One of the earliest examples of these kinds of conversions was in [[Damascus]], Syria, where in 705 [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[caliph]] [[Al-Walid I]] bought the church of [[John the Baptist|St. John]] from the [[Christian]]s and had it rebuilt as a mosque in exchange for building a number of new churches for the Christians in Damascus. Overall, [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] (Al-Waleed's father) is said to have transformed 10 churches in Damascus into mosques.<ref>{{cite book|author=M. Th. Houtsma|title=E.J. Brill's First Encyclopedia of Islam, 1913-1936|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Va6oSxzojzoC&pg=PA321|accessdate=21 February 2013|year=1993|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-09791-9|page=21}}</ref>

The process of turning churches into mosques was especially intensive in the villages where most of the inhabitants [[Religious conversion|converted]] to Islam. The [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] turned many churches into mosques. [[Ottoman Turks]] converted nearly all churches, monasteries, and chapels in [[Constantinople]], including the famous [[Hagia Sophia]], immediately after [[fall of Constantinople|capturing the city in 1453]] into mosques. In some instances mosques have been established on the places of [[Judaism|Jewish]] or Christian sanctuaries associated with [[Bible|Biblical]] personalities who were also recognized by Islam.<ref name="Masdjid1">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hillenbrand| first = R | editor = P.

In the central Islamic lands | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | issn = 1573-3912 }}</ref>

Mosques have also been converted for use by other religions, notably in southern Spain, following the conquest of the Moors in 1492.<ref>{{cite book|title=How Islam Plans to Change the World |last=Wagner |first=William |accessdate=June 22, 2006 |publisher=Kregel Publications |page=99 |quote=When the Moors were driven out of Spain in 1492, most of the mosques were converted into churches |isbn=978-0-8254-3965-0|year=2004 |origyear=2004-05-27}}</ref> The most prominent of them is the [[Cathedral<U+2013>Mosque of C<U+00F3>rdoba|Great Mosque of Cordoba]]. The [[Iberian Peninsula]] and southeast Europe are other regions in the world where such instances occurred once no longer under Muslim rule.

==Religious functions==
The ''masjid j<U+0101>mi''', a central mosque, can play a role in religious activities such as teaching the [[Quran]] and educating future imams.

===Prayers===
[[File:Istiqlal Mosque Eid ul Fitr Jamaah 2.JPG|thumb|Inside the [[Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]], during [[Eid ul-Fitr]].]]
There are two holidays (''Eids'') in the [[Islamic calendar]], [[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha]], during which there are special prayers held at mosques in the morning. These [[Salat al Eid|Eid prayers]] are supposed to be offered in large groups, and so, in the absence of an outdoor ''[[eidgah]]'' larger mosques will normally host them for their congregants as well as the congregants of smaller local mosques. Some mosques will even rent [[convention center]]s or other large public buildings to hold the large number of Muslims who attend. Mosques, especially those in countries where Muslims are the majority, will also host Eid prayers outside in courtyards, [[town square]]s or on the outskirts of town in an ''[[Eidgah]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/prayer/Eid-Prayers_1.html |accessdate=April 8, 2006 |title='Id Prayers (Salatul 'Idain) |publisher=University of Southern California |work=Compendium of Muslim Texts}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/eidgah.htm Performance of Eid Salah in Eidgah (Open Field)]</ref>

===Ramadan events===
Islam's holiest month, ''[[Ramadan]]'', is observed through many events. As Muslims must [[sawm|fast]] during the day during Ramadan, mosques will host ''[[iftar]]'' dinners after sunset and the fourth required prayer of the day, ''[[maghrib]]''. Food is provided, at least in part, by members of the community, thereby creating nightly [[potluck]] dinners. Because of the community contribution necessary to serve iftar dinners, mosques with smaller congregations may not be able to host the ''iftar'' dinners daily. Some mosques will also hold ''[[suhoor]]'' meals before [[dawn]] to congregants attending the first required prayer of the day, ''[[fajr]]''. As with iftar dinners, congregants usually provide the food for suhoor, although able mosques may provide food instead. Mosques will often invite poorer members of the Muslim community to share in beginning and breaking the fasts, as providing [[Alms|charity]] during Ramadan is regarded in Islam as especially honorable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/fasting/tajuddin/fast_51.html| accessdate=April 17, 2006| title=Charity| publisher=University of Southern California |work=Compendium of Muslim Texts}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>

Following the last obligatory daily prayer (''[[Isha']]'') special, optional ''[[tarawih]]'' prayers are offered in larger mosques. During each night of prayers, which can last for up to two hours each night, usually one member of the community who has memorized the entire Quran (a [[Hafiz (Quran)|Hafiz]]) will recite a segment of the book.<ref name="teach-islam">{{cite book|title=Teach Yourself Islam |last=Maqsood |first=Ruqaiyyah Waris |isbn=978-0-07-141963-5 |date=April 22, 2003 |edition=2nd |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=57<U+2013>8, 72<U+2013>5, 112<U+2013>120 |location=Chicago}}</ref> Sometimes, several such people (not necessarily of the local community) take turns to do this. During the last ten days of Ramadan, larger mosques will host all-night programs to observe [[Laylat al-Qadr]], the night Muslims believe that Muhammad first received Quranic revelations.<ref name="teach-islam" /> On that night, between [[sunset]] and [[sunrise]], mosques employ speakers to educate congregants in attendance about Islam. Mosques or the community usually provide meals periodically throughout the night

During the last ten days of [[Ramadan (calendar month)|Ramadan]], larger mosques within the Muslim community will host ''[[I<U+02BF>tik<U+0101>f]]'', a practice in which at least one Muslim man from the community must participate. Muslims performing itikaf are required to stay within the mosque for ten consecutive days, often in worship or learning about Islam. As a result, the rest of the Muslim community is responsible for providing the participants with food, drinks, and whatever else they need during their stay.<ref name="teach-islam" />

===Charity===
The third of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]] states that Muslims are required to give approximately one-fortieth of their wealth to charity as ''[[zakat]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Matthew Clarke|title=Development and Religion: Theology and Practice|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DIvHQc0-rwgC&pg=PA156|accessdate=21 February 2013|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-0-85793-073-6|page=156}}</ref> Since mosques form the center of Muslim communities, they are where Muslims go to both give ''zakat'' and, if necessary, collect it. Prior to the holiday of Eid ul-Fitr, mosques also collect a special zakat that is supposed to assist in helping poor Muslims attend the prayers and celebrations associated with the holiday.

==Contemporary political roles==
{{See also|Political aspects of Islam}}
[[File:Islamic Centre, Little Harwood, Blackburn - geograph.org.uk - 35559.jpg|thumb|Muslim men standing outside an Islamic center in [[Little Harwood]], [[United Kingdom]].]]

The late 20th century saw an increase in the number of mosques used for political purposes. Today, civic participation is commonly promoted in mosques in the [[Western world]]. Because of the importance in the community, mosques are used for preaching peaceful coexistence with non-believers, even in times of adversity.

Large mosques sometimes play a political role as well. In Islamic countries like Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq (after 2003), political subjects are preached by imams at Friday congregations on a regular basis.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,411903,00.html |title=What Muslims Hear at Friday Prayers |accessdate=October 31, 2010 |publisher=Der Spiegel | date=April 19, 2006}}</ref> In other Islamic countries, imams are usually banned from mentioning political issues.

===Advocacy===
Countries with a minority Muslim population are more likely than Muslim-majority countries of the [[Greater Middle East]] to use mosques as a way to promote civic participation.<ref name="tc">{{cite web|url=http://www.tc.edu/muslim-nyc/research/projects/role%20of%20muslims.html |publisher=Teachers' College <U+2013> Columbia University |title=The Role of Mosques in the Civic and Political Incorporation of Muslim American |last=Jamal |first=Amany |accessdate=April 22, 2006}}</ref> American mosques host [[voter registration]] and civic participation drives that promote involving Muslims, who are often first- or second-generation immigrants, in the political process. As a result of these efforts as well as attempts at mosques to keep Muslims informed about the issues facing the [[Ummah|Muslim community]], regular mosque attendants are more likely to participate in [[protest]]s, sign [[petition]]s, and otherwise be involved in politics.<ref name="tc" />

Nevertheless, a link between [[Ideology|political views]] and mosque attendance can still be seen in other parts of the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Study: Islam devotion not linked to terror|url=http://www.umich.edu/~urecord/0405/Jun13_05/03.shtml|publisher=The University Record Online |last=Swanbrow |first=Diane |date=June 23, 2005 |accessdate=February 24, 2007}}</ref> Following the [[2006 al-Askari Mosque bombing|al-Askari Mosque bombing]] in February 2006, imams and other Islamic leaders used mosques and [[Jumu'ah|Friday prayers]] as vehicles to call for calm and peace in the midst of widespread violence.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4747886.stm |date=February 24, 2006 |accessdate=April 23, 2006 |title=Friday prayer plea for Iraq calm |publisher=BBC}}</ref>

===Social conflict===
{{See also|Islamophobia|Israeli<U+2013>Palestinian conflict}}

As they are considered important to the Muslim community, mosques, like other places of worship, can be at the heart of social conflicts. The [[Babri Mosque]] was the subject of such a conflict up until the early 1990s when it was demolished. Before a mutual solution could be devised, the mosque was destroyed on December 6, 1992 as the mosque was built by [[Babur]] allegedly on the site of a previous [[Hindu temple]] marking the birthplace of [[Rama]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Flashpoint Ayodhya |url=http://www.archaeology.org/0407/abstracts/ayodhya.html |date=July/August 2004 |publisher=Archaeology |last=Romey |first=Kristen M.}}</ref> The controversy surrounded the mosque was directly linked to [[Bombay Riots|rioting in Bombay]] (present-day [[Mumbai]]) as well as [[1993 Bombay bombings|bombings in 1993]] that killed 257 people.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Rollins|title=International Terrorism and Transnational Crime: Security Threats, U.

A February 2006 and [[2007 al-Askari Mosque bombing|June 2007 bombing]] that seriously damaged Iraq's [[al-Askari Mosque]], exacerbated tensions that had already existed. Other mosque bombings in Iraq, both before and after the February 2006 bombing, have been part of the conflict between the country's groups of Muslims. However, mosque bombings have not been exclusive to Iraq; in June 2005, a [[suicide attack|suicide bomber]] killed at least 19 people at an Afghan [[Shia Islam|Shia]] mosque near Jade Maivand.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/01/AR2005060100263.html |date=June 2, 2006 |accessdate=April 23, 2006 |title=Suicide Bomber Kills 20 in Afghan Mosque |publisher=The Washington Post |page=A16 |last=Aizenman |first=N.C.}}</ref> In April 2006, [[2006 Jama Masjid explosions|two explosions]] occurred at India's Jama Masjid.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mahendra Gaur|title=Indian Affairs Annual 2006|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fo-LS2-nOZMC&pg=PA146|accessdate=21 February 2013|date=1 June 2006|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7835-529-0|page=146}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Pratiyogita Darpan|title=Pratiyogita Darpan|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=trBMVnMmk6oC&pg=PT175|accessdate=21 February 2013|date=February 2009|publisher=Pratiyogita Darpan|page=1509}}</ref>

===Saudi influence===
[[File:Faisal mosque2.jpg|thumb|Funded by King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]], the [[Faisal Mosque]] in [[Islamabad]] is the largest mosque in [[Pakistan]].]]
Although the Saudi involvement in mosques around the world can be traced back to the 1960s, it was not until later in the 20th century that the government of Saudi Arabia became a large influence in foreign mosques.<ref name="money-trails">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A13266-2004Aug18 |title=U.S. Eyes Money Trails of Saudi-Backed Charities |date=August 19, 2004 |accessdate=February 24, 2007|last=Ottoway |first=David B. |page=A1 |publisher=The Washington Post}}</ref> Beginning in the 1980s, the Saudi Arabian government began to finance the construction of mosques in countries around the world. An estimated [[United States dollar|US$]]45 billion has been spent by the Saudi Arabian government financing mosques and Islamic schools in foreign countries. ''[[Ain al-Yaqeen]]'', a Saudi newspaper, reported in 2002 that Saudi funds may have contributed to building as many as 1,500 mosques and 2,000 other Islamic centers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/031215/15terror.htm |title=The Saudi Connection |date=December 15, 2003 |accessdate=April 17, 2006 |last=Kaplan |first=David E. |publisher=U.S. News and World Report}}</ref>

Saudi citizens have also contributed significantly to mosques in the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], especially in countries where they see Muslims as poor and oppressed. Following the fall of the Soviet Union, in 1992, mosques in war-torn Afghanistan saw many contributions from Saudi citizens.<ref name="money-trails" /> The King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, California and the Islamic Cultural Center of Italy in [[Rome]] represent two of Saudi Arabia's largest investments in foreign mosques as former Saudi king [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|Fahd bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud]] contributed US$8 million<ref name="money-trails" /> and US$50&nbsp;million<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingfahdbinabdulaziz.com/main/m4506.htm |accessdate=April 17, 2006 |publisher=King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz |title=Islamic Center in Rome, Italy}}</ref> to the two mosques, respectively.

==Architecture==

===Styles===
{{Further|Islamic architecture}}
[[File:Shahmosque.jpg|thumb|The [[Shah Mosque]] in Iran represents [[Iranian architecture]]. It was constructed during the Persian [[Safavid dynasty]].]]
''Arab-plan'' or [[hypostyle]] mosques are the earliest type of mosques, pioneered under the Umayyad Dynasty. These mosques have square or rectangular plans with an enclosed courtyard and covered prayer hall. Historically, in the warm Middle Eastern and [[Mediterranean climate]]s, the courtyard served to accommodate the large number of worshippers during Friday prayers. Most early hypostyle mosques had flat roofs on prayer halls, which required the use of numerous [[column]]s and [[Support (structure)|supports]].<ref name="Masdjid1" /> One of the most notable hypostyle mosques is the Great Mosque of Cordoba in Spain, the building being supported by over 850 columns.<ref name = "mit-handout"/> Frequently, hypostyle mosques have outer [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] so that visitors can enjoy the shade. Arab-plan mosques were constructed mostly under the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties; subsequently, however, the simplicity of the Arab plan limited the opportunities for further development, the mosques consequently losing popularity.<ref name="Masdjid1" />

The first separate brand within mosque designs started appearing in Persia (Iran). The [[Persian people|Persians]] had inherited a rich architectural legacy from the earlier Persian dynasties, and they started incorporating elements from earlier [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] palace-designs into their mosques, influenced by buildings such as the [[Palace of Ardashir]] and the [[Sarvestan Palace]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/arc/ind/2_meisaku/55_shah/sha_eng.htm |title=THE ROYAL MOSQUE (MASJED-e-EMAM) in Isfahan, Iran |publisher=Ne.jp |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}</ref> Thus, [[Islamic architecture]] started witnessing the introduction of such structures as domes and large, arched entrances, referred to as ''[[iwan]]s''. During [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq rule]], as [[Sufism|Islamic mysticism]] was on the rise, the [[Shah Mosque#Design <U+2013> the four-iwan style|four-iwan]] arrangement took form. The four-iwan format, finalized by the Seljuqs, and later inherited by the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]]s, firmly established the courtyard facade of such mosques, with the towering gateways at every side, as more important than the actual buildings themselves,<ref name="autogenerated1"/> and they typically took the form of a square-shaped, central courtyard with large entrances at each side, giving the impression of being gateways to the spiritual world.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen P. Blake|title=Half the world: the social architecture of Safavid Isfahan, 1590-1722|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AVAqAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=21 February 2013|year=1999|publisher=Mazda Pub.|isbn=978-1-56859-087-5|pages=143<U+2013>144}}</ref> Soon, a distinctly [[Iranian architecture|Persian style]] of mosques started appearing that would significantly influence the designs of later [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]], and also Mughal, mosque designs.

[[File:Cairo Al Hakim 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Al-Hakim Mosque]] in Cairo is an exemplar of [[Fatimid architecture]].]]

The Ottomans introduced central dome mosques in the 15th century. These mosques have a large dome centered over the prayer hall. In addition to having a large central dome, a common feature is smaller domes that exist off-center over the prayer hall or throughout the rest of the mosque, where prayer is not performed.<ref name="mit-vocab">{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 |accessdate=April 9, 2006 |title=Vocabulary of Islamic Architecture |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060918221451/http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 |archivedate = September 18, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> This style was heavily influenced by Byzantine architecture with its use of large central domes.<ref name="Masdjid1" /> Hajja Soad's mosque took a [[pyramid]] shape which is a creative style in Islamic architecture.

The [[Faisal Mosque]] in [[Islamabad]], Pakistan in a relatively unusual design fuses contemporary lines with the more traditional look of an Arab [[Bedouin]]'s tent, with its large triangular prayer hall and four minarets. However, unlike traditional mosque design, it lacks a dome. The mosque's architecture is a departure from the long history of South Asian Islamic architecture. It is one of the most outstanding and modern Islamic architecture examples in the world.

Mosques built in Southeast Asia often represent the [[Architecture of Indonesia|Indonesian-Javanese style architecture]], which are different from the ones found throughout the Greater Middle East. The ones found in Europe and North America appear to have various styles but most are built on Western artchitectural designs, some are former churches or other buildings that were used by non-Muslims. In Africa, most mosques are old but the new ones are built to give it a look of the Greater Middle East. This can be seen in the [[Abuja National Mosque]] in Nigeria and others.

===Minarets===
[[File:The Blue Mosque at sunset.jpg|thumb|The [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]] in Istanbul]]

A common feature in mosques is the [[minaret]], the tall, slender tower that usually is situated at one of the corners of the mosque structure. The top of the minaret is always the highest point in mosques that have one, and often the highest point in the immediate area. The tallest minaret in the world is located at the [[Hassan II Mosque]] in [[Casablanca]], Morocco.<ref>{{cite book|title=Call to Prayer: My Travels in Spain, and Morocco |last=Walters |first=Brian |date=May 17, 2004 |publisher=Virtualbookworm Publishing |isbn=978-1-58939-592-3 |page=14 |chapter=The Prophet's People |quote=Its 210-meter minaret is the tallest in the world}}</ref>

The first mosques had no minarets, and even nowadays the most conservative Islamic movements, like [[Wahhabi]]s, avoid building minarets, seeing them as ostentatious and [[hazard]]ous in case of collapse. The first minaret was constructed in 665 in [[Basra]] during the reign of the Umayyad caliph [[Muawiyah I]]. Muawiyah encouraged the construction of minarets, as they were supposed to bring mosques on par with Christian churches with their [[bell tower]]s. Consequently, mosque architects borrowed the shape of the bell tower for their minarets, which were used for essentially the same purpose<U+2014>calling the faithful to prayer.<ref name="Manara">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hillenbrand| first = R | editor = P.J.

Before the five required daily prayers, a ''[[muezzin]]'' calls the worshippers to prayer from the minaret. In many countries like Singapore where Muslims are not the majority, mosques are prohibited from loudly broadcasting the call to prayer (''[[adhan]]''), although it is supposed to be said loudly to the surrounding community. The adhan is required before every prayer. However, nearly every mosque assigns a muezzin for each prayer to say the adhan as it is a recommended practice or ''[[sunnah]]'' of the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. At mosques that do not have minarets, the adhan is called instead from inside the mosque or somewhere else on the ground.<ref name="teach-islam" /> The ''[[iqama]]'', which is similar to the adhan and said immediately before the start of prayer, is usually not said from the minaret even if a mosque has one.

===Mihrab===
[[File:Prophet Mohammad Mihrab.jpg|thumb|Prophet Mohammad Mihrab in Masjid al-nabawi]]
[[Mihrab]] is semicircular [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] in the wall of a mosque that indicates the ''[[qibla]]''; that is, the direction of the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] and hence the direction that [[Muslim]]s should face when praying. The wall in which a ''mihrab'' appears is thus the "''qibla'' wall."

''Mihrab''s should not be confused with the ''[[minbar]]'', which is the raised platform from which an [[Imam]] (leader of prayer) addresses the congregation.

===Domes===
The domes, often placed directly above the main prayer hall, may signify the vaults of [[jannah|heaven]] and the sky.<ref>{{cite book|title=Symmetries of Nature: A Handbook for Philosophy of Nature and Science |last=Mainzer |first=Klaus |date=June 1, 1996 |isbn=978-3-11-012990-8 |page=124 |chapter=Art and Architecture |quote=the dome arching over the believers like the spherical dome of the sky|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin}}</ref> As time progressed, domes grew, from occupying a small part of the roof near the mihrab to encompassing the whole roof above the prayer hall. Although domes normally took on the shape of a hemisphere, the Mughals in India popularized onion-shaped domes in South Asia.<ref>{{cite book|title=Architecture of Mughal India |last=Asher |first=Catherine B. |date=September 24, 1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=256 |isbn=978-0-521-26728-1 |chapter=Aurangzeb and the Islamization of the Mughal style}}</ref> Some mosques have multiple, often smaller, domes in addition to the main large dome that resides at the center.

===Prayer hall===
The prayer hall, also known as the ''musallah'', rarely has furniture; chairs and pews are generally absent from the prayer hall so as to allow as many worshipers as possible to line the room.<ref name="unitulsa">{{cite web|url=http://www.utulsa.edu/iss/Mosque/MosqueFAQ.html |accessdate=April 9, 2006 |publisher=The University of Tulsa |title=Mosque FAQ|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070330202640/http://www.utulsa.edu/iss/Mosque/MosqueFAQ.html |archivedate = March 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Some mosques have [[Islamic calligraphy]] and Quranic verses on the walls to assist worshippers in focusing on the beauty of Islam and its holiest book, the Quran, as well as for decoration.<ref name="teach-islam" />

[[File:Great Mosque of Kairouan, prayer hall.jpg|thumbnail|left|The hypostyle prayer hall in the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]].]]
Often, a limited part of the prayer hall is sanctified formally as a masjid in the sharia sense (although the term masjid is also used for the larger mosque complex as well). Once designated, there are onerous limitations on the use of this formally designated masjid, and it may not be used for any purpose other than worship; restrictions that do not necessarily apply to other areas of the mosque complex (although such uses may be restricted by the conditions of the ''[[waqf]]'' that owns the mosque).<ref name="qaSunniPathFiqhMasjid"/>

In many mosques, especially the early congregational mosques, the prayer hall has the hypostyle form (the roof held up by a multitude of columns).<ref>{{cite book|author=Fred S. Kleiner|title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IJrN8rDirxkC&pg=PA265|accessdate=21 February 2013|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-57355-5|page=265}}</ref> One of the finest examples of the hypostyle-plan mosques is the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] (also known as the Mosque of Uqba) in Tunisia.<ref>{{cite book|author=Fred S. Kleiner|title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IJrN8rDirxkC&pg=PA267|accessdate=21 February 2013|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-57355-5|page=267}}</ref>

Usually opposite the entrance to the prayer hall is the ''[[qibla]]h'' wall, the visually emphasized area inside the prayer hall. The qiblah wall should, in a properly oriented mosque, be set perpendicular to a line leading to [[Mecca]], the location of the ''[[Kaaba]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Writing Signs: Fatimid Public Text |date=December 16, 1998 |last=Bierman |first=Irene A. |publisher=University of California Press |page=150 |isbn=978-0-520-20802-5}}</ref> Congregants pray in rows parallel to the qiblah wall and thus arrange themselves so they face Mecca. In the qiblah wall, usually at its center, is the mihrab, a niche or depression indicating the direction of Mecca. Usually the mihrab is not occupied by furniture either. Sometimes, especially during Friday prayers, a raised ''[[minbar]]'' or pulpit is located to the side of the mihrab for a ''[[khatib]]'' or some other speaker to offer a sermon (''[[khutbah]]''). The mihrab serves as the location where the imam leads the five daily prayers on a regular basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ioc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~islamarc/WebPage1/htm_eng/index/keyword1_e.htm |accessdate=April 9, 2006 |title=Terms 1: Mosque |publisher=University of Tokyo Institute of Oriental Culture}}</ref>

===Ablution facilities===
[[File:Ablution area inside Eastern wall of Badshahi mosque.JPG|thumb|The [[wudu]] (or ablution) area, where Muslims wash their hands, forearm, face and feet before they pray.]]
As [[Ritual purification#Islam|ritual purification]] precedes all prayers, mosques often have [[wudu|ablution]] fountains or other facilities for washing in their entryways or courtyards. However, worshippers at much smaller mosques often have to use restrooms to perform their ablutions. In traditional mosques, this function is often elaborated into a freestanding building in the center of a courtyard.<ref name="mit-handout">{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/4.614/www/handout02.html |accessdate=April 9, 2006 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |title=Religious Architecture and Islamic Cultures}}</ref> This desire for cleanliness extends to the prayer halls where shoes are disallowed to be worn anywhere other than the cloakroom. Thus, foyers with shelves to put shoes and racks to hold coats are commonplace among mosques.<ref name="unitulsa" />

===Contemporary features===
Modern mosques have a variety of amenities available to their congregants. As mosques are supposed to appeal to the community, they may also have additional facilities, from [[clinic|health clinics]] to [[library|libraries]] to [[gym]]nasiums, to serve the community.

==Makeshift and temporary structures for Islamic worship==
A temporary place set aside for Islamic worship is called a musalla (''Jama'at Khana'' in South Asia). A musallah is often not part of a permanent endowment (waqf), or it is otherwise not intended to become a permanent legal masjid (as defined in the Sharia). Often musallas are used while a community looks for a piece of land for a permanent masjid, or the establishment of a masjid is not practical at the time. They could be located in rented apartments, industrial units or store fronts.<ref name="qaSunniPathFiqhMasjid"/>

==Rules and etiquette==
Mosques, in accordance with Islamic practices, institute a number of rules intended to keep Muslims focused on worshipping [[God in Islam|God]]. While there are several rules, such as those regarding not allowing shoes in the prayer hall, that are universal, there are many other rules that are dealt with and enforced in a variety of ways from mosque to mosque.

===Prayer leader===
[[File:Interiormosquekrekelstraatnijmegen.jpg|left|thumb|Muslims praying inside a mosque in the [[Netherlands]].]]
Appointment of a prayer leader is considered desirable, but not always obligatory.<ref name="mawardi112">{{cite book | last=Abu al-Hasankok Ibn Muhammad Ibn Habib |first=Al-Mawardi |authorlink=Al-Mawardi | title=The Ordinances of Government (''Al-Ahkam al-Sultaniyya w'al-Wilayat al-Diniyya'') | publisher=Garnet Publishing | location=Lebanon | year=2000 | isbn=978-1-85964-140-8|page=184}}</ref> The permanent prayer leader (imam) must be a free honest individual and is authoritative in religious matters.<ref name="mawardi112" /> In mosques constructed and maintained by the government, the prayer leader is appointed by the ruler;<ref name="mawardi112" /> in private mosques, however, appointment is made by members of the congregation through [[majority rule|majority voting]]. According to the [[Hanafi]] [[Madh'hab|school]] of Islamic jurisprudence, the individual who built the mosque has a stronger claim to the title of imam, but this view is not shared by the other schools.<ref name="mawardi112" />

Leadership at prayer falls into three categories, depending on the type of prayer: five daily prayers, Friday prayer, or optional prayers.<ref name="mawardi112" /> According to the Hanafi and [[Maliki]] school of Islamic jurisprudence, appointment of a prayer leader for Friday service is mandatory because otherwise the prayer is invalid. The [[Shafi'i]] and [[Hanbali]] schools, however, argue that the appointment is not necessary and the prayer is valid as long as it is performed in a congregation. A slave may lead a Friday prayer, but Muslim authorities disagree over whether the job can be done by a minor.<ref name="mawardi112" /> An imam appointed to lead Friday prayers may also lead at the five daily prayers; [[List of Islamic studies scholars|Muslim scholars]] agree to the leader appointed for five daily services may lead the Friday service as well.<ref name="mawardi112" />

All Muslim authorities hold the consensus opinion that only men may lead prayer for men.<ref name="mawardi112" /> Nevertheless women prayer leaders are allowed to lead prayer in front of all-female congregations.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=Z9WF1fRGOsQC&pg=PA63&dq=false#v=onepage&q=false&f=false |title=Karin van Nieuwkerk, "Women Embracing Islam"|page=63|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292773769|year=2006}}</ref>

===Cleanliness===
{{See also|Ritual purity in Islam}}
[[File:Zoetermeer Meerzicht Moskee Qibla (04).JPG|upright|thumb|Storage for shoes]]
All mosques have rules regarding cleanliness, as it is an essential part of the worshippers' experience. Muslims before prayer are required to cleanse themselves in an ablution process known as ''wudu''. However, even to those who enter the prayer hall of a mosque without the intention of praying, there are still rules that apply. Shoes must not be worn inside the carpeted prayer hall. Some mosques will also extend that rule to include other parts of the facility even if those other locations are not devoted to prayer. Congregants and visitors to mosques are supposed to be clean themselves. It is also undesirable to come to the mosque after eating something that smells, such as garlic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunnipath.com/Resources/PrintMedia/Hadith/H0002P0016.aspx |publisher=SunniPath |work=SunniPath Library |accessdate=July 12, 2006 |title=Chapter 16.

===Dress===
Islam requires that its adherents wear [[Islam and clothing|clothes]] that portray [[modesty]]. As a result, although many mosques will not enforce violations, both men and women when attending a mosque must adhere to these guidelines. Men are supposed to come to the mosque wearing loose and clean clothes that do not reveal the shape of the body. Likewise, it is recommended that women at a mosque wear loose clothing that covers to the wrists and ankles, and cover their heads with a ''[[hijab]]'' or other covering. Many Muslims, regardless of their ethnic background, wear Middle Eastern clothing associated with Arabic Islam to special occasions and prayers at mosques.<ref name="teach-islam" />

===Concentration===
As mosques are places of worship, those within the mosque are required to remain respectful to those in prayer. Loud talking within the mosque, as well as discussion of topics deemed disrespectful, is forbidden in areas where people are praying. In addition, it is disrespectful to walk in front of or otherwise disturb Muslims in prayer.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Connecting Cultures, Inc. |title=Building Cultural Competency: Understanding Islam, Muslims, and Arab Culture |publisher=Connecting Cultures, Inc. |url=http://www.maec.org/2004conferencepapers/ismail.doc |page=15 |format=Doc |accessdate=July 12, 2006}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> The walls within the mosque have few items, except for possibly Islamic calligraphy, so Muslims in prayer are not distracted.<ref>[http://books.google.fr/books?id=ondWbP0sB-MC&pg=PA47&dq=false#v=onepage&q&f=false John Renard (1996), ''Seven Doors to Islam: Spirituality and the Religious Life of Muslims''. University of California Press. p. 47]</ref> Muslims are also discouraged from wearing clothing with distracting [[image]]s and [[symbol]]s so as not to divert the attention of those standing behind them during prayer. In many mosques, even the carpeted prayer area has no designs, its plainness helping worshippers to focus.

===Gender separation===
{{Further|Gender segregation and Islam}}
[[File:Frauengebetsraum Khadija-Moschee.jpg|thumb|Women's prayer hall in the [[Khadija Mosque]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].]]
There is nothing written in the Qur<U+02BC>an about the issue of space in mosques and gender separation. However, traditional rules have segregated women and men. By traditional rules, women are most often told to occupy the rows behind the men. In part, this was a practical matter as the traditional posture for prayer - kneeling on the floor, head to the ground - made mixed-gender prayer uncomfortably revealing for many women and distracting for some men. Traditionalists try to argue that Muhammad preferred women to pray at home rather than at a mosque, and they cite a ''[[hadith]]'' in which Muhammad supposedly said: "The best mosques for women are the inner parts of their houses," although women were active participants in the mosque started by Muhammad. Muhammad told Muslims not to forbid women from entering mosques. They are allowed to go in. The second Sunni caliph <U+02BB>[[Umar]] at one time prohibited women from attending mosques especially at night because he feared they may be sexually harassed or assaulted by men, so he required them to pray at home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/humanrelations/womeninislam/womeninsociety.html#mosque |accessdate=April 15, 2006 |title=Women in Society |publisher=University of Southern California |work=Compendium of Muslim Texts |last=Doi |first=Abdur Rahman I.}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> Sometimes a special part of the mosque was railed off for women; for example, the governor of Mecca in 870 had ropes tied between the columns to make a separate place for women.<ref name="Masdjid1" />

Many mosques today will put the women behind a barrier or partition or in another room. Mosques in South and Southeast Asia put men and women in separate rooms, as the divisions were built into them centuries ago. In nearly two-thirds of American mosques, women pray behind partitions or in separate areas, not in the main prayer hall; some mosques do not admit women at all due to the lack of space and the fact that some prayers, such as the Friday Jumu<U+02BB>ah, are mandatory for men but optional for women. Although there are sections exclusively for women and children, the [[Masjid al-Haram|Grand Mosque]] in Mecca is desegregated.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.columbiajournalist.org/rw1_dinges/2005/article.asp?subj=national&course=rw1_dinges&id=624 |accessdate=April 9, 2006 |date=January 26, 2006 |title=Muslim Women Seek More Equitable Role in Mosques |last=Rezk |first=Rawya |publisher=The Columbia Journalist}}</ref>

===Non-Muslims in mosques===

Under most interpretations of sharia, non-Muslims may be allowed into mosques, as long as they do not sleep or eat there. A dissenting opinion is presented by followers of the [[Maliki]] school of Islamic jurisprudence, who argue that non-Muslims may not be allowed into mosques under any circumstances.<ref name="mawardi112" />

The Quran addresses the subject of non-Muslims, and particularly [[polytheism|polytheists]], in mosques in two verses in its ninth chapter, [[At-Tawba|Sura At-Tawba]]. The seventeenth verse of the chapter prohibits those who ''join gods with Allah''<U+2014>polytheists<U+2014>from entering mosques:
{{Quote|It is not for such as join gods with Allah, to visit or maintain the mosques of Allah while they witness against their own souls to infidelity. The works of such bear no fruit: In Fire shall they dwell.|Quran, ''[[Sura]]'' 9 (At-Tawba), ''[[ayah]]'' 17<ref>{{Cite quran|9|17|s=ns|t=y}}</ref>}}

The twenty-eighth verse of the same chapter is more specific as it only considers polytheists in the Sacred Mosque, the [[Masjid al-Haram]] in Mecca:
{{Quote|O ye who believe! Truly the Pagans are unclean; so let them not, after this year of theirs, approach the Sacred Mosque. And if ye fear poverty, soon will Allah enrich you, if He wills, out of His bounty, for Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.|Quran, Sura 9 (At-Tawba), ayah 28<ref>{{Cite quran|9|28|s=ns|t=y}}</ref>}}

According to [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], these verses were followed to the letter at the times of Muhammad, when [[Jews]] and Christians, considered [[monotheism|monotheists]], were still allowed to the Masjid al-Haram. However, the Umayyad caliph [[Umar II]] later forbade non-Muslims from entering mosques, and his ruling remains in practice in present day Saudi Arabia.<ref name="Masdjid1" /> Today, the decision on whether non-Muslims should be allowed to enter mosques varies. With few exceptions, mosques in the Arabian Peninsula as well as Morocco do not allow entry to non-Muslims. For example, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca is one of only two mosques in Morocco currently open to non-Muslims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/02/25/morocco.travel.ap/index.html|title=Morocco travel|publisher=CNN|accessdate=September 22, 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012004112/http://edition.cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/02/25/morocco.travel.ap/index.html |archivedate = October 12, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

However, there are also many other places in the west as well as the Islamic world where non-Muslims are welcome to enter mosques. Most mosques in the United States, for example, report receiving non-Muslim visitors every month.<ref name="mosquesinamerica">{{Cite journal | coauthors=Bagby, Ihsan; Perl, Paul M.; and Froehle, Bryan T. | title=The Masjid in America: A National Portrait | publisher=[[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] | year=2001 | url=http://www.cair-net.org/mosquereport/Masjid_Study_Project_2000_Report.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=April 17, 2006}}</ref> Many mosques throughout the United States welcome non-Muslims as a sign of openness to the rest of the community as well as to encourage conversions to Islam.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Takim |first=Liyakatali |month=July |year=2004 |title=From Conversion to Conversation: Interfaith Dialogue in Post 9<U+2013>11 America |journal=The Muslim World |volume=94 |pages=343<U+2013>355 |url=http://www.macdonald.hartsem.edu/articles/mw943f.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=June 16, 2006 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.2004.00058.x|issue=3}} [http://www.ltakim.com/ Liyakatali Takim] is a professor at [[McMaster University]]</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4511780.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=June 16, 2006 |title=Laptop link-up: A day at the mosque |date=December 5, 2005}}</ref>

In modern-day Saudi Arabia, the Grand Mosque and all of Mecca are open only to Muslims. Likewise, the Al-Masjid al-Nabawi and the city of [[Medina]] that surrounds it are also off-limits to those who do not practice Islam.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Beliefs & Religions|last=Goring |first=Rosemary |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |date=May 1, 1997 |isbn=978-1-85326-354-5}}</ref> For mosques in other areas, it has most commonly been taken that non-Muslims may only enter mosques if granted permission to do so by Muslims and if they have a legitimate reason. All entrants regardless of [[List of religions and spiritual traditions|religious affiliation]] are expected to respect the rules and [[decorum]] for mosques.<ref name="teach-islam" />

In modern Turkey non-Muslim tourists are allowed to enter any mosque, but there are some strict rules. Visiting a mosque is allowed only between prayers; visitors are required to wear long trousers and not to wear shoes, women must cover their heads; visitors are not allowed to interrupt praying Muslims, especially by taking photos of them; no loud talk is allowed; and no references to other religions are allowed (no crosses on necklaces, no cross gestures etc.) Similar rules apply to mosques in Malaysia, where larger mosques that are also tourist attractions (such as the [[National Mosque of Malaysia|Masjid Negara]]) provide robes and headscarves for visitors who are deemed inappropriately attired.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Peter|title=Malaysia, Singapore & Brunei|year=1996|publisher=Lonely Planet|location=Hawthorn, Vic.|isbn=978-0-86442-393-1|edition=6|first2=Chris|last2=Taylor|first3=Hugh|last3=Finlay}}</ref>

In certain times and places, non-Muslims were expected to behave a certain way in the vicinity of a mosque: in some Moroccan cities, Jews were required to remove their shoes when passing by a mosque;<ref>{{cite book | first=Norman | last=Stillman | title=The Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book | publisher=Jewish Publication Society of America | location=Philadelphia | year=1979 | isbn=978-0-8276-0116-1 |page=83}}</ref> in 18th century Egypt, Jews and Christians had to dismount before several mosques in veneration of their sanctity.<ref>{{cite book | author=Bat Ye'or| authorlink = Bat Ye'or | title=Islam and Dhimmitude.
