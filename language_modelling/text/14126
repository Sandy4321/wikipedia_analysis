'''Herpangina''' from ''herp'', an itching, and ''angina'', a sore throat, literally "a choking"; also called mouth [[blister]]s) is the name of a painful mouth [[infection]] caused by [[coxsackievirus]]es.  Usually, herpangina is produced by one particular strain of coxsackievirus A, but it can also be caused by coxsackievirus B or [[echovirus|echoviruses]].  It is most common in children.  Though herpangina can be asymptomatic, symptoms usually associated are high [[fever]] and [[sore throat]].

A small number of lesions (usually 2 - 6) form in the back area of the [[mouth]], particularly the [[soft palate]] or [[tonsil|tonsillar pillars]].  The lesions progress initially from red [[macule]]s to [[vesicle]]s and lastly to [[ulcer|ulcerations]] which can be 2 - 4 mm in size.  The lesions heal in 7 - 10 days.

[[Histology|Histologically]], the [[epithelium|epithelial]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] show signs of intracelular and intercellular [[edema]].  A [[diagnosis]] can be made from clinical signs and symptoms, and treatment consists of minimizing the discomfort of symptoms.  [[Aspirin]] is avoided.
