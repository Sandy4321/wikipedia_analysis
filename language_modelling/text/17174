'''Operation Crimp'''<U+2014>also known as the Battle of the Ho Bo Woods<U+2014>was a joint US-Australian military operation during the [[Vietnam War]], which took place {{convert|20|km|mi}} north of [[Cu Chi]] in [[Binh Duong Province]], [[South Vietnam]], between 8<U+2013>14 January 1966. The operation targeted a key [[Viet Cong]] headquarters that was believed to be concealed underground, and involved two [[brigades]] of the [[US 1st Infantry Division]] including the [[1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (1RAR), which was attached to the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team (United States)|US 173rd Airborne Brigade]]. Heavy fighting developed resulting in significant casualties on both sides, however the combined American and Australian force was able uncover an extensive tunnel network covering more than {{convert|200|km|mi}}. Despite some success, the allied force was only able to partially clear the area and consequently it remained a key communist transit and supply base thoroughout the war. The operation was the largest allied military action mounted in South Vietnam to that point, being the first [[division (military)|divisional]]-sized operation of the war.

==Background==
[[File:III CTZ May to September 1965.jpg|thumb|220px|left|III CTZ May to September 1965.]]
The initial American commitment to the war in Vietnam was limited to materiel and advisors, although by 1964 there were 21,000 US advisors in South Vietnam.<ref>McNeill 1993, p. 54.</ref> However, the worsening situation led to a significant escalation of the war in 1965, and the large-scale commitment of ground troops under the command of [[General]] [[William Westmoreland]].<ref>McNeill 1993, pp. 53<U+2013>67.</ref> Initially the Americans had adopted a cautious strategy, applied to the strictly limited role of base defence by [[US Marine]] units. This was abandoned in April 1965, and replaced by a new 'enclave strategy' of defending key coastal population centres and installations.<ref>McNeill 1993, pp. 63<U+2013>67.</ref> This strategy required the introduction of nine additional US battalions<U+2014>or 14,000 troops<U+2014>to bring the total in Vietnam to 13. Allied nations of the [[Free World Military Forces]] were expected to contribute another four battalions.<ref>McNeill 1993, p. 67.</ref>

Australia's growing involvement in Vietnam reflected the American build-up. In 1963, the Australian government had committed a small advisory team, known as the [[Australian Army Training Team Vietnam]] (AATTV), to help train the [[ARVN|South Vietnamese forces]].<ref>Dennis et al 2008, p. 555.</ref> However in June 1965 the decision to commit ground troops was made, and the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment<U+2014>originally commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan 'Lou' Brumfield<U+2014>was dispatched. Supporting 1RAR was [[1st Armoured Personnel Carrier Squadron (Australia)|1 Troop, A Squadron, Prince of Wales Light Horse]] with [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M-113 Armoured Personnel Carriers]], 105 Field Battery, [[Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery]], and 161 Field Battery, [[Royal New Zealand Artillery]]; in total 1,700 personnel.<ref name=McAulay4>McAulay 2005, p. 4.</ref> The Australian units were attached to the US 173rd Airborne Brigade under the command of [[Brigadier General]] Ellis W. Williamson in [[Bien Hoa]]<ref>Faley 1999, pp. 34<U+2013>36.</ref> and operated throughout the [[III Corps (South Vietnam)|III Corps Tactical Zone]] to help establish the Bien Hoa-Vung Tau enclave.<ref>McNeill 1993, p. 65.</ref> Although logistics and resupply were primarily provided by the Americans, a small logistic unit<U+2014>1st Australian Logistics Company<U+2014>was situated at Bien Hoa airbase.<ref name=McAulay4/>

Unlike later Australian units that served in Vietnam, which included [[Conscription|conscripts]], 1RAR was manned by [[Regular army|regular personnel]] only.<ref>Breen 1988, p. 12.</ref> The battalion commenced operations in late June 1965 and initially focussed on defeating the Viet Cong's wet season offensive. During this time US 173rd Brigade, including 1RAR, conducted a number of operations into [[War Zone D]]<U+2014>a major communist base area at the junction of Phuoc Long, Long Khanh, Bien Hoa and Binh Duong provinces. Operations were also conducted in the notorious [[Iron Triangle (Vietnam)|Iron Triangle]], formed by the confluence of the [[Saigon River|Saigon]] and Thi Tinh rivers and Route 7, where they fought a number of significant actions including the [[Battle of Gang Toi]] in November, before launching ''Operation Marauder'' in the Plain of Reeds in the [[Mekong Delta]] on New Years Day 1966.<ref>McNeill 1993, pp. 85<U+2013>109.</ref><ref>Coulthard-Clark 2001, pp. 277<U+2013>279.</ref><ref>Faley 1999, p. 36.</ref>

==Prelude==
Located {{convert|4|km|mi}} west of the Iron Triangle, the Ho Bo Woods were believed to contain the political-military headquarters of the communist 4th Military Region, which controlled all [[Viet Cong]] activity around the South Vietnamese capital, [[Saigon]]. Although its precise position was unknown, it was believed to be concealed in an extensive underground bunker system.<ref name=Coulthard279>Coulthard-Clark 2001, p. 279.</ref> Agents' reports, the interrogation of prisoners, and aerial surveillance all pointed to the presence of this vital communist facility. The headquarters itself was believed to be located in a {{convert|31|km<U+00B2>|sqmi|adj=on}} area of jungle and marshland, and to have four entrances guarded by a Viet Cong Regional Force company, while two Main Force [[battalions]] were also thought to be in the vicinity to afford additional security.<ref>McNeill 1993, p. 165.</ref> Communist units detected in the Ho Bo Woods by allied intelligence included the C306 Local Force Company, 3rd Quyet Thang Battalion and 7th Cu Chi Battalion.<ref>McAulay 2005, pp. 89<U+2013>90.</ref><ref group="Note">The PAVN official history written after the war mentions only C306 Local Force Company specifically by name during its recount of the battle, although it does allude to the presence of other units. See Van Thai 2002, p. 176.</ref><ref group="Note">Quy<U+1EBF>t Th<U+1EAF>ng means "resolve to win".</ref> The commander of the Cu Chi Battalion was later identified after the war as Captain Nguyen Thanh Linh.<ref name=Arnett/>

In response, a large American 'search-and-destroy' operation was launched, involving more the 8,000 troops of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|US 1st Infantry Division]], including the US 173rd Airborne Brigade and the [[3rd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division (United States)|US 3rd Infantry Brigade]], under the overall command of [[Major General]] [[Jonathan O. Seaman]]; in total six [[battalion]]s plus supporting arms.<ref name=Ham152/><ref name=McNeill166/> Still attached to the US 173rd Brigade was the Australian battalion, 1RAR<U+2014>by now commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Alex Preece<U+2014>with 105 Field Battery in direct support, as well as engineers from 3rd Field Troop, Royal Australian Engineers and the M113s from the Prince of Wales Light Horse.<ref name=McNeill442>McNeill 1993, p. 442.</ref> At the time it was the largest military operation mounted in South Vietnam, being the first divisional offensive to date.<ref name=Ham152>Ham 2008, p. 152.</ref> The scheme of manoeuvre envisioned an airmobile assault by the US 173rd Brigade in the north and west, while the US 3rd Infantry Brigade would seal off the area to the south, in preparation for a sweep designed to push trapped communist forces eastwards against the Saigon River. 1RAR's role was to establish a blocking position in a village beside the river on the northern flank of the brigade's [[area of operations]].<ref name=Coulthard279/> In order to achieve tactical surprise, the operation was launched immediately following ''Operation Marauder'', with the Australians and Americans redeployed by air.<ref>Breen 1988, p. 176.</ref><ref>Faley 1999, p. 40.</ref>

Prior to the assault, the 1RAR Operations Officer, Major John Essex-Clarke, conducted an aerial reconnaissance of the proposed Landing Zone<U+2014>known as LZ June<U+2014>on 7 January. Observing a lack of ground foliage he was concerned about the possibility of extensive Viet Cong defensive works close to the LZ, and with the support of Williamson it was subsequently switched to a less-exposed location. The original plan would have seen 1RAR inserted directly on top of a heavily defended bunker system, and would have likely resulted in heavy casualties.<ref name=Coulthard279/> Captain Alec MacGregor, the commander of the 3rd Field Troop, was of the opinion that the "...decision almost certainly saved hundreds of Australian lives."<ref>MacGregor and Thomson 1993, p. 102.</ref>

==Battle==
===Insertion, 8 January 1966===
[[File:Boeing B-52 dropping bombs.jpg|thumb|220px|right|An American [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] on a bomb run over South Vietnam, similar to those used during Operation Crimp.]]
The battle began at 0930 on 8 January with heavy American preparatory fire from artillery, as well as [[napalm]] and [[airstrikes]] from [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bombers which resulted in significant defoliation.<ref name=Ham152153>Ham 2008, pp. 152<U+2013>153.</ref> Soon after the airmobile operation commenced with the first American units being inserted by helicopter to the north, west and south.<ref name=Ham152153/> The US 3rd Infantry Brigade<U+2014>under the command of Colonel William Brodbeck<U+2014>was subsequently inserted by helicopter and by road. The brigade headquarters and command element departed Di An in convoy and reached Trung Lap on the western boundary of the brigade<U+2019>s area of operations by midday. Concurrently, two battalions were inserted by helicopter to the south-west, one blocking the south side of the Ho Bo Woods while the other conducted a sweep. The Americans were in contact almost immediately, although the engagements were generally small scale, or involving snipers.<ref name=TunnelRats>{{cite web|last =|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Tunnel Rats: 1 Field Squadron RAE |work=|publisher=|date=|url=http://www.1fieldsappers.org/files/page.php?p=22 |doi=|accessdate=09 December 2009}}</ref> Meanwhile the brigade's third battalion moved by road to Trung Lap and then moved on foot to its assigned search area.<ref name=Carland170>Carland 2000, p. 170.</ref>

In the north, 1RAR was inserted into its new landing zone<U+2014>LZ March<U+2014>{{convert|3|km|mi}} to the south-west.<ref name=Coulthard280/> With B Company securing the site, the battalion moved on foot to the line of departure but not before they were mistakenly engaged by US helicopter gunships and artillery fire. However, after the Australians established communications, the shelling was halted and they began their advance.<ref name=Ham155>Ham 2008, p. 155.</ref> No sooner had the lead elements<U+2014>D Company, under the command of Major Ian Fisher<U+2014>emerged into the cleared area that was originally to have been used as the battalion's LZ, the forward [[platoon]]<U+2014>12 Platoon<U+2014>came under fire from Viet Cong positions in the tree-line on the north-east corner.<ref name=Coulthard280/> In the action which followed, six Australians were wounded, including platoon commander Lieutenant Jim Bourke, who was shot through the jaw but remained in command until he passed out from loss of blood.<ref name=Ham155/> Two medics who attempted to move forward to treat the casualties were themselves shot and killed.<ref name=Coulthard280/>

Preece moved to push his other companies around each flank of D Company, and towards the battalion's original blocking position. Soon they were also in contact with small groups of Viet Cong from positions behind trees and in bunkers, while others popped up from spider holes and tunnel entrances; it became apparent to the Australians that they had stumbled across a significant Viet Cong force in extensive fortifications, sufficient to hold a battalion.<ref name=Coulthard280/> B Company, under the command of Major Ian McFarlane, also uncovered a small dug-in hospital with simple transfusion equipment, documents and bandages.<ref>McNeill 1993, p. 167</ref> Meanwhile, the remaining battalions of the US 173rd Airborne Brigade had also been inserted. The 1st Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment flew into LZ April at 1200, while 2/503rd Battalion arrived at LZ May at 1430.<ref name=Carland172>Carland 2000, p. 172.</ref> With the insertion going largely according to plan, the brigades began their advance eastwards.<ref name=McNeill166>McNeill 1993, p. 166.</ref> Converging on the suspected location of the communist headquarters, a thorough search of the area yielded little, and it was believed that the Viet Cong had withdrawn earlier in response to the initial Australian advance.<ref name=Carland172/>

Amid strong resistance, the Australians were made to fight their way through the maze of bunkers, [[Punji stick|punji stakes]] and booby traps but they were eventually able to force a Viet Cong regional force company to withdraw as they continued their advance.<ref name=Coulthard280/> The area was heavily seeded with trip wires connected to shells and grenades dangling from branches, one of which blew McFarlane and several of his men off their feet.<ref>Ham 2008, p. 156.</ref> The defenders subsequently withdrew, with 7th Cu Chi Battalion forced north and 3rd Quyet Thang Battalion to the east.<ref>McAulay 2005, p. 90.</ref> Suspecting they were being drawn into a trap<U+2014>as one the American battalions of the brigade had been previously during [[Operation Hump]]<ref name=McNeill166/><U+2014>the Australians moved into a tightly defended perimeter before dark and waited for the communists to counter-attack.<ref name=Coulthard280/> As night fell, movement was detected along a trench on the C Company perimeter when a squad of Viet Cong attempted to infiltrate the Australian position. Initially believing the movement to be another Australian patrol that had just departed on a clearing patrol, the machine gunner on sentry duty finally opened fire at the last safe moment, killing one of the infiltrators at point-blank range and wounding a number of others before they withdrew.<ref>Breen 1988, p. 189.</ref>

Minor actions continued into the night, with small groups of Viet Cong found to be able to pop up undetected and then disappear at will from within the Australian defensive position. With the searching units were unable to locate Viet Cong in large numbers, and yet still experiencing a significant number of sudden engagements and ambushes throughout the day, it became clear that the communists were using tunnels for movement and concealment. Preece suspected that the area was honeycombed with tunnels and that the communist headquarters that he had been tasked to destroy was in fact located beneath the feet of the battalion.<ref name=Coulthard280/> The Australians were the only battalion in the US 173rd Brigade to strike significant resistance and by the end of the first day 1RAR had suffered a total of three killed and 15 wounded, while the artillery [[Forward Observer]] from 105 Field Battery had also been killed.<ref>McNeill 1993, pp. 166<U+2013>167.</ref> The battalion spent a sleepless night and in the early hours of the morning there were a number of short exchanges of fire as small groups of Viet Cong returned to the area. Not wanting to fire the machine guns for fear of giving their positions away or hitting other friendly troops, the Australians resorted to using grenades forward of the perimeter.<ref>Breen 1988, p. 190.</ref> Meanwhile, in the US 3rd Infantry Brigade area of operations contact had been light, although six Viet Cong were killed.<ref>McAulay 2005, p. 41.</ref>

===Tunnels of Cu Chi, 9 January 1966===
{{main|Cu Chi tunnels}}
[[File:Operation Crimp Tunnels.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Australian soldier in Viet Cong tunnel uncovered during Operation Crimp.]]
The process of breaking into and exploring the communist tunnels began on 9 January, with the objective now switching to the location, clearance and destruction of the tunnel complexes.<ref name=Coulthard280/> Whereas standard US Army practice was to seal, blow up or otherwise attempt to render tunnel systems unusable with smoke, tear gas and explosives before quickly moving on, the Australians spent the next few days laboriously searching and mapping the complexes they found using military engineers.<ref name=Coulthard280/> Led by Captain Sandy MacGregor, the Australian sappers from 3 Field Troop systematically tackled the tunnels, using telephone line and compasses to plot the subterranean passages. Small-scale contacts between the communists and the Australians continued and MacGregor was later awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his leadership.<ref>Ham 2008, p. 157.</ref>

Originally constructed in 1945 by the [[Viet Minh]] during the fighting with the French in the [[First Indochina War]], the tunnels at Cu Chi had taken decades to build but later had lain dormant after the war until 1960, when they were reactivated. Since then they had endured constant bombing, all the while being expanded. By 1965 they formed an underground maze of passages, fighting tunnels, meeting rooms and food caches, stretching from Saigon to the Cambodian border. Given their headquarters function, the tunnels were equipped with an array of communications and medical facilities and were defended by interlocking [[Crossfire|arcs of fire]] and connecting fire tunnels.<ref>Ham 2008, p. 153.</ref> Dug into hard clay which had largely protected them from American bombing, some trenches were reported as being more {{convert|1.8|m|ft}} deep, and some tunnels as long as {{convert|460|m|yd}}, while numerous side tunnels led from the main tunnels.<ref name=NYTimes>New York Times 1966, p. 3.</ref> In places the system was between one, two and even three levels deep.<ref name=Arnett>Arnett 1977, p. 4.</ref> The network was so extensive that they were rumoured to be able to hold 5,000 men, many of whom lived underground for up to six months at a time.<ref name=MacGregor126/> On seeing the tunnels one American soldier described them at the time as "the New York subway".<ref name=NYTimes/>

In the southern area of operations, the US 3rd Infantry Brigade was making slow progress, with the Viet Cong using [[Hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run]] and [[ambush]] tactics to inflict casualties on the Americans, before withdrawing into the sanctuary of their underground tunnels.<ref name=Carland171>Carland 2000, p. 171.</ref> On 9 January, the Americans located and destroyed a cache of medical supplies, as well as a large amount of rice and a small hospital, as well as capturing 30 Viet Cong during a series of skirmishes.<ref name=Carland170/> To the north, while 1RAR searched the tunnel complex the American battalions of the US 173rd Airborne Brigade continued to sweep their area of operations, while a number of [[friendly fire]] incidents also complicated their task.<ref name=Carland173>Carland 2000, p. 173.</ref><ref name=Breen193/> Both the 1/503rd and 2/503rd Battalions searched eastward toward the Saigon River and, although they continued to find supply caches and abandoned positions, they were involved in only minor skirmishes with the Viet Cong.<ref name=Carland173/> Concealed in well-camouflaged ambush positions however, the communists inflicted a number of casualties on the Americans.<ref name=Breen193>Breen 1988, p. 193.</ref> Only one Viet Cong was killed during the fighting, bringing the total for the operation to just 22. Despite the large number of US troops involved they had experienced only limited contact to that point, and criticism of the operation consequently began to mount in the American media.<ref>Mohr 1966, p. 3.</ref><ref name=NYTimes/>

===Fighting intensifies, 10<U+2013>11 January 1966===
The Australians continued to explore the tunnels, finding a large quantity of documents and equipment, and by 10 January they had recovered 59 weapons, 20,000 rounds of ammunition, 100 fragmentation grenades, one 57-mm recoilless rifle, explosives, clothing and medical supplies. At least 11 Viet Cong had also been killed in the fighting.<ref name=McNeill168>McNeill 1993, p. 168.</ref> Contact also continued, and overnight the Australians killed another five Viet Cong outside their perimeter, while numerous actions occurred during the day as the US 173rd Brigade maintained its sweep.<ref>McAulay 2005, pp. 129<U+2013>135.</ref> On 10 January at 0900 the American cavalry from [[17th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|Troop E, 17th Cavalry Regiment]] and the Australians from the Prince of Wales Light Horse commenced a combined search operation and fought communist snipers and small groups throughout most of the day. At 1400 a number of Viet Cong dug-in in trenches were encountered, and following a series of air-strikes and artillery barrages, the cavalry and the Australian M113s swept the area during which several Australians were slightly injured by a misdirected [[US Navy]] air-strike. Sixteen Viet Cong bodies were subsequently recovered, and another 60 were believed to have been killed but had been removed from the battlefield.<ref>McAulay 2005, pp. 135<U+2013>136.</ref> 

Williamson subsequently ordered the 1/503rd Battalion<U+2014>under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Tyler<U+2014>to change the direction of its advance.<ref name=Carland173/> During the morning the battalion had conducted platoon-sized patrols south, south-west and west, locating a well-constructed defensive position, including bunkers and trenches connected by tunnels. With no contact as yet made with the Viet Cong, the battalion prepared to move to a new AO in the north by 1330. During this move the battalion, and armour from Troop D, 16th Cavalry Regiment, engaged a dug-in Viet Cong Main Force company less than {{convert|2000|m|yd}} west of the Australians. Following air-strikes and heavy artillery bombardment the communists withdrew, leaving 29 dead during a sharp engagement.<ref name=Carland173/><ref name=Breen193/><ref name=McAulay137>McAulay 2005, p. 137.</ref> The 2/503rd Battalion had also sent out a number of squad-sized patrols during the day, but no recent signs of Viet Cong activity were found, and only minor sniper fire encountered.<ref name=McAulay137/> However, like the Australians, the American paratroopers also uncovered a large number of tunnels and other fortifications.<ref name=Breen193/>

Meanwhile, the US 3rd Brigade continued to make slow progress and, despite reaching the banks of the Saigon River by 10 January, only a few brief glimpses of the Viet Cong had been made.<ref name=TunnelRats/><ref name=Ham154>Ham 2008, p. 154.</ref> A small base camp was discovered and destroyed however, while another battalion captured more than 10 tons of rice and 15 bales of [[cotton]].<ref name=Carland171/> The following day the Americans found and destroyed more bunkers and a number of houses and [[sampans]], as well as quantities of supplies and food. They also uncovered a tunnel complex and a quantity of maps, charts and documents, although still little resistance was met. During these actions the Americans lost more men to [[booby traps]] than enemy fire.<ref name=Carland171/> Advancing on a {{convert|1500|m|yd}} front, troops from the 1/28th Battalion<U+2014>commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Haldane<U+2014>took a number of casualties from snipers, although the source of the fire was not immediately obvious.<ref name=Ham154/> The Commanding Officer of 2/28th Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel George Eyster, was himself shot and killed during the fighting.<ref name=TunnelRats/><ref name=Ham154/><ref name=Arnett/> Regardless, after receiving word of the discovery of the tunnels by US 173rd Airborne Brigade to their north, the brigade began another sweep.<ref name=TunnelRats/> 

[[File:Australians OP Crimp Vietnam.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Australian soldiers being served a hot meal near the fighting zone.]]

The US 3rd Brigade subsequently uncovered a significant tunnel complex themselves after Sergeant Stewart Green from 1/28th Battalion accidentally sat down on a nail and uncovered a trap door on 11 January. Volunteering to enter the tunnel, Green subsequently located an underground dispensary occupied by more than 30 Viet Cong. Later a smoke machine was used to pump smoke into the tunnel system, and this was successful in locating numerous tunnel entrances and bunkers as the smoke rose above the jungle canopy.<ref name=Ham154/> They were the first American troops to enter the tunnels, and they proceeded to attack them with [[CS gas]], and later explosives.<ref name=WashingtonPost>Sullivan 2008, p. B06.</ref> However, such tactics met with limited success with the tear gas flushing out large numbers of women and children, but few Viet Cong.<ref name=NYTimes/>

Even as the Americans were attempting to clear the tunnels, heavy hand-to-hand fighting broke out above ground and Haldane was later awarded the [[Silver Star]] for his actions when he rushed a bunker while under fire and armed only with a [[pistol]], in order to give first aid to a number of wounded soldiers. His courage inspired his men to complete the assault, and ultimately helped ensure the successful evacuation of the casualties and the capture of their objective.<ref name=WashingtonPost/> That evening the battalions of US 3rd Infantry Brigade had completed searching their assigned area of operation, and the following morning they were withdrawn from the operation. The brigade's involvement in Crimp had been limited, losing six killed and 45 wounded, while 22 Viet Cong had been killed.<ref name=Carland171/> It was subsequently redeployed on ''Operation Buckskin''.<ref>McAulay 2005, p. 168.</ref>

===Crimp continues, 12<U+2013>13 January 1966===
As they had done previously, the communists continued to attempt to infiltrate the 1RAR perimeter during the night, and a minor clash with an Australian standing patrol occurred at dawn.<ref>McAulay 2005, p. 143.</ref> Over the next two days, operations to exploit the tunnels continued, with the US 173rd Brigade and the Australians involved in a number of contacts, as well as suffering from sporadic sniper and mortar fire. Significant quantities of documents, equipment and rice were captured however, and large numbers of civilians detained for questioning.<ref>McAulay 2005, pp. 228<U+2013>231.</ref>  On 12 January, 1RAR continued its patrolling program and one patrol subsequently located 15 tons of rice and destroyed it after killing six Viet Cong during a 20-minute battle.<ref>The Evening Independent 1966, p. 10.</ref><ref>McAulay 2005, p. 145.</ref> The task was complicated by the presence of a large number of civilians however, and many were found hiding in shelters and tunnels and they had to be coaxed out of hiding by the Australians and transported to a refugee camp which had been established nearby.<ref>McAulay 2005, pp. 143<U+2013>144.</ref> Another patrol from 11 Platoon later uncovered a tunnel system just {{convert|50|m|yd}} from their position, and found it to be occupied by a large Viet Cong force after a dog and its handler were sent into the tunnel to investigate. Eight Viet Cong were subsequently killed after the tunnel was destroyed by Australian engineers.<ref>McAulay 2005, p. 146.</ref> 

The same day, however, the Australian efforts to clear the tunnels had suffered a setback after an engineer became stuck in a trap door between one underground gallery and another, more than {{convert|2|m|ft}} below the surface. Despite the efforts of his comrades, he could not be recovered and died after being overcome by a combination of tear gas, carbon monoxide, and lack of oxygen when he dislodged his respirator during the struggle to free himself.<ref name=McNeill168/> After days of living in close proximity to the enemy, the constant strain of sniper fire and the pressure of searching the tunnels was also beginning to take its toll, and a number of Australians were killed and wounded in otherwise avoidable friendly fire incidents on the evenings of 10 and 12 January.<ref>Breen 1988, pp. 194<U+2013>195.</ref> During the early afternoon of 12 January the Australians encountered a large group of armed Viet Cong during a tunnel clearance and called on them to surrender. Failing to emerge, the tunnel was subsequently demolished, probably killing eight Viet Cong who were entombed as it collapsed.<ref>McAulay 2005, p. 161 and p. 228.</ref> 

Later, as the 1/503rd continued to search its area with platoon-size patrols during the afternoon of 13 January, a clash between Company C and a Viet Cong platoon developed into a heavy contact. An air-strike was successfully called in by the Americans however, and a search of the area recovered 10 dead Viet Cong, while blood trails and human remains indicated that perhaps another 20 were also killed.<ref>McAulay 2005, p. 173.</ref>

===Action concludes, 14 January 1966===
Ultimately, more than {{convert|17|km|mi}} of tunnels had been uncovered and searched by the Australians. A large quantity of documents had been recovered, including more than 100,000 pages detailing operational structure as well as the name of agents operating in Saigon. 90 weapons were also captured, as well as thousands of rounds of ammunition and enough equipment, food and other supplies to fill eight 2<U+00BD>-tonne trucks.<ref name=Coulthard280/> The Australians had actually partially searched a tunnel leading to the headquarters that was their objective, but did not learn how close they had come to succeeding until decades after the war ended.<ref>MacGregor and Thomson 1993, pp. 125<U+2013>126.</ref> During the course of these activities one engineer had died of [[asphyxiation]] as previously described, while a number of other fatalities among the searchers were caused by snipers.<ref name=Coulthard280/>

Fully exploring and destroying the tunnels was well beyond the allied resources available, and the decision was eventually made to call a halt to operations.<ref name=Breen193/> Six days after it began, ''Operation Crimp'' ended, with 1RAR returning to Bien Hoa on 14 January.<ref name=Coulthard280>Coulthard-Clark 2001, p. 280.</ref> By the time the operation was concluded, only a fraction of the known tunnel network had been destroyed. It was only after the war that it was learnt that the system at Cu Chi actually included more than {{convert|200|km|mi}} of tunnels.<ref name=Coulthard280/> Although further American ground operations as well a number of heavy B52 bombing raids resulted in further damage to the tunnel complexes, the Ho Bo Woods were never occupied on a permanent basis and the Viet Cong were successful in restoring their transit and supply functions.<ref name=Breen196/> As such, despite significant disruption, the military and political apparatus in Cu Chi remained largely intact, allowing the communists freedom of action for later operations against Saigon.<ref name=MacGregor126>MacGregor and Thomson 1993, p. 126.</ref>

==Aftermath==
During the fighting the Australians had faced stiff resistance and had suffered eight killed and 29 wounded, while claiming 27 Viet Cong killed and a further 30 probably killed.<ref name=McNeill442/> The Americans had also been involved in heavy fighting and their casualties included 14 killed and 76 wounded.<ref name=McNeill442/> Total communist casualties included 128 confirmed killed, and another 190 probably killed, as well as 92 captured and another 509 suspects detained.<ref>McNeill 1993, p. 443.</ref> In addition many more Viet Cong were thought likely to have perished in the tunnels as they were collapsed by charges laid by the Australian engineers.<ref name=Breen196>Breen 1988, p. 196.</ref> The Americans later claimed that the headquarters of the communist 4th Military Region had also been destroyed.<ref>Bradley 2006, p. 16.</ref> Due to the quantity of information recovered from the thousands of captured documents alone, the battle was later described as the first allied strategic intelligence victory of the war.<ref>Horner 2008, p. 175.</ref> So significant was the find that both Westmoreland and General [[Joseph A. McChristian|Joseph McChristian]], the head of Intelligence at [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam|MACV]], visited 1RAR during ''Operation Crimp''.<ref>McAulay 2007, p. 34.</ref><ref group="Note">Neither Westmoreland nor McChristian referred to the operation in their end of tour reports, however. See McAulay 2007, p. 34.</ref> Later, as a result of the success of the Australians in clearing the tunnels, American units soon adopted the same tactics, creating a number of tunnel-clearance teams, popularly known as [[Tunnel rat (military)|Tunnel Rats]].<ref>Mangold 2005.</ref> 

Despite the losses suffered by the communists, the combined American and Australian force had only succeeded in partially clearing the area and the tunnel network it concealed, and consequently the Ho Bo Woods would remain a key communist transit and supply base thorough out the war.<ref name=Coulthard280/> Equally the bulk of the communist force had been withdrawn intact, leaving only rear guard elements in defence. As such the communists also declared the operation a victory, claiming almost 2,000 American troops killed or wounded, 100 vehicles destroyed, and 50 aircraft shot down.<ref>Van Thai 2002, p. 176.</ref> However, such claims were based on estimates of casualties caused by command-detonated mines, punji sticks and other booby traps, and proved to be widely inaccurate.<ref>McAulay 2005, p. 200.</ref> Indeed, Operation Crimp rattled the communists and they subsequently ordered their units in the south to prevent the Americans from concentrating their forces in the future.<ref>Ang 2002, p. 104.</ref> The Ho Bo Woods were again targeted by the Americans in January 1967, during a much larger operation known as [[Operation Cedar Falls]].<ref>McAulay 2005, pp 232<U+2013>234.</ref> Despite  heavy casualties being inflicted on the Viet Cong, the tunnels remained a problem for the Americans and they were later used as a communist staging area for the attack on Saigon during the [[Tet Offensive|1968 Tet offensive]].<ref>McAulay 2005, p. 235.</ref> In 1970, American B-52 bombers carried out a number of heavy air-strikes, dropping thousands of delayed-fuse bombs that buried deep into the ground before exploding, finally ending the tunnels' utility.<ref name=WashingtonPost/>

At the strategic level, the allied enclave strategy proved only transitory.<ref>McNeill 1993, p. 66.</ref> Further setbacks led to additional troop increases to halt the losing trend, with US troop levels planned to rise from 210,000 in January to 326,000 by December 1966.<ref>McNeill 1993, p. 171.</ref> In March 1966, as part of this strategy, the Australian government also increased its commitment to the ground war in Vietnam, committing a two battalion brigade<U+2014>known as the [[1st Australian Task Force]]<U+2014>with armour, aviation and artillery support; in total 6,300 personnel.<ref>Horner 2008, p. 177.</ref> 1RAR was subsequently replaced and 1ATF was allocated its own area of operations in [[Phuoc Tuy Province]], thereby allowing the Australians to pursue operations more independently using their own tactics. The task force arrived between April and June 1966, constructing a base at [[Nui Dat]], while logistic arrangements were provided by 1st Australian Logistic Support Group which was subsequently established at the port of [[Vung Tau]].<ref>Dennis et al 2008, p. 556.</ref> ''Operation Crimp'' was 1RAR's third and last foray into the communist heartland and following the fighting they had more than two weeks rest in Bien Hoa<U+2014>their longest break from operations during the battalion's tour.<ref>McNeill 1993, p. 164.</ref><ref>McNeill 1993, p. 169.</ref> Further operations followed in the months afterwards however, including the [[Battle of Suoi Bong Trang]] on the night of 23<U+2013>24 February 1966.<ref name=Coulthard280/>
