'''''King Solomon's Mines''''' (1885) is a popular novel by the [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] adventure writer and [[fable|fabulist]] Sir [[H. Rider Haggard]]. It tells of a search of an unexplored region of Africa by a group of adventurers led by [[Allan Quatermain]] for the missing brother of one of the party. It is the first English [[adventure novel]] set in Africa, and is considered to be the genesis of the [[Lost World (genre)|Lost World]] [[literary genre]].

==Background==
The book was first published in September 1885 amid considerable fanfare, with billboards and posters around London announcing "The Most Amazing Book Ever Written". It became an immediate best seller. By the late 19th century, explorers were uncovering [[ancient civilisations]] around the world, such as Egypt's [[Valley of the Kings]], and the empire of [[Assyria]]. Inner Africa remained [[Association for Promoting the Discovery of the Interior Parts of Africa|largely unexplored]] and ''King Solomon's Mines'', the first novel of African adventure published in English, captured the public's imagination.

The "[[Solomon|King Solomon]]" of the book's title is the [[:Category:Monarchs of the Hebrew Bible|Biblical king]] renowned both for his wisdom and for his wealth. A number of sites have been suggested as the location of his mines, including the workings at the [[Timna valley]] near [[Eilat]]. Research published in September 2013 has shown that this site was in use during the 10th century BC as a copper mine possibly by the [[Edomites]],<ref>http://phys.org/news/2013-09-proof-solomon-israel.html</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Proof of Solomon's mines found in Israel|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/proof-of-solomons-copper-mines-found-in-israel/2013/09/08/|accessdate=17 September 2013|newspaper=The Jewish Press|date=September 8, 2013 Read more at: http://www.jewishpress.com/news/proof-of-solomons-copper-mines-found-in-israel/2013/09/08/}}</ref> who the Bible reports were rivals of and frequently at war with King Solomon.<ref>[[Edom#Biblical Edom]]</ref><ref>http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0006_0_05562.html</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Boyle|first=Alan|title=Reality check on King Solomon's mines: Right era, wrong kingdom|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/reality-check-king-solomons-mines-right-era-wrong-kingdom-f8C11073742|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=NBC News|date=September 5, 2013}}</ref>

Haggard knew Africa well, having travelled deep within the continent as a 19-year-old during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] and the [[First Boer War]], where he had been impressed by South Africa's vast mineral wealth and by the ruins of ancient lost cities being uncovered, such as [[Great Zimbabwe]]. His original Allan Quatermain character was based in large part on [[Frederick Courtney Selous]], the famous British [[white hunter]] and explorer of [[Colonial Africa]].<ref name="mandiringana">{{Cite journal|quotes= |last=Mandiringana |first=E.  |authorlink= |coauthors=T.

Haggard also owed a considerable debt to [[Joseph Thomson (explorer)|Joseph Thomson]], the Scottish explorer whose book ''Through Masai Land'' was a hit in January 1885.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}<!-- need source supporting "hit" --> Thomson had terrified warriors in Kenya by taking out his false teeth and claiming to be a magician, just as Captain Good does in ''King Solomon's Mines''.

==Plot summary==
[[File:Kukuanaland.jpg|thumb|right|The way to Kukuanaland]]
[[Allan Quatermain]], an adventurer and [[white hunter]] based in [[Durban]], in what is now South Africa, is approached by aristocrat [[Sir Henry Curtis]] and his friend Captain Good, seeking his help finding Sir Henry's brother, who was last seen travelling north into the unexplored interior on a quest for the fabled King Solomon's Mines. Quatermain has a mysterious map purporting to lead to the mines, but had never taken it seriously. However, he agrees to lead an expedition in return for a share of the treasure, or a stipend for his son if he is killed along the way. He has little hope they will return alive, but reasons that he has already outlived most people in his profession, so dying in this manner at least ensures that his son will be provided for. They also take along a mysterious native, Umbopa, who seems more regal, handsome and well-spoken than most porters of his class, but who is very anxious to join the party.

Travelling by oxcart, they reach the edge of a desert, but not before a hunt in which a wounded elephant claims the life of a servant. They continue on foot across the desert, almost dying of thirst before finding the oasis shown halfway across on the map. Reaching a mountain range called Suliman Berg, they climb a peak (one of "[[Queen of Sheba|Sheba]]'s Breasts") and enter a cave where they find the frozen corpse of [[Jos<U+00E9> Silvestre]] (also spelt Silvestra), the 16th-century Portuguese explorer who drew the map in his own blood. That night, a second servant dies from the cold, so they leave his body next to Silvestra's, to "give him a companion".
They cross the mountains into a raised valley, lush and green, known as Kukuanaland. The inhabitants have a well-organised army and society and speak an ancient dialect of [[IsiZulu]]. Kukuanaland's capital is Loo, the destination of a magnificent road from ancient times. The city is dominated by a central royal [[kraal]].

They soon meet a party of Kukuana warriors who are about to kill them when Captain Good nervously fidgets with his false teeth, making the Kukuanas recoil in fear. Thereafter, to protect themselves, they style themselves "white men from the stars" <U+2013> sorcerer-gods <U+2013> and are required to give regular proof of their divinity, considerably straining both their nerves and their ingenuity.

They are brought before King Twala, who rules over his people with ruthless violence. He came to power years before when he murdered his brother, the previous king, and drove his brother's wife and infant son, Ignosi, out into the desert to die. Twala's rule is unchallenged. An evil, impossibly ancient hag named Gagool is his chief advisor. She roots out any potential opposition by ordering regular witch hunts and murdering without trial all those identified as traitors. When she singles out Umbopa for this fate, it takes all Quatermain's skill to save his life.

Gagool, it appears, has already sensed what Umbopa soon after reveals: he is Ignosi, the rightful king of the Kukuanas. A rebellion breaks out, the Englishmen gaining support for Ignosi by taking advantage of [[Solar eclipses in fiction|their foreknowledge of a solar eclipse]] to claim that they will black out the sun as proof of Ignosi's claim. The Englishmen join Ignosi's army in a furious battle. Although outnumbered, the rebels overthrow Twala, and Sir Henry lops off his head in a duel.

The Englishmen also capture Gagool, who reluctantly leads them to King Solomon's Mines. She shows them a treasure room inside a mountain, carved deep within the [[rock-cut architecture|living rock]] and full of gold, diamonds and ivory. She then treacherously sneaks out while they are admiring the hoard and triggers a secret mechanism that closes the mine's vast stone door. Unfortunately for Gagool, a brief scuffle with a beautiful native named Foulata <U+2013> who had become attached to Good after nursing him through his injuries sustained in the battle <U+2013> causes her to be crushed under the stone door, though not before fatally stabbing Foulata. Their scant store of food and water rapidly dwindling, the trapped men prepare to die also. After a few despairing days sealed in the dark chamber, they find an escape route, bringing with them a few pocketfuls of diamonds from the immense trove, enough to make them rich.

The Englishmen bid farewell to a sorrowful Ignosi and return to the desert, assuring him that they value his friendship but must return to be with their own people, Ignosi in return promising them that they will be venerated and honoured among his people forever. Taking a different route, they find Sir Henry's brother stranded in an oasis by a broken leg, unable to go forward or back. They return to Durban and eventually to England, wealthy enough to live comfortable lives.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Haggard wrote the novel as a result of a five-[[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] wager with his brother,<ref>[http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/haggard.htm Henry Rider Haggard] URL accessed 15 December 2008</ref> namely whether he could write a novel half as good as [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Treasure Island]]'' (1883).<ref name=Monsman>Gerald Monsman (ed.), ''King Solomon's Mines'', Broadview Press, 2002. ISBN 1-55111-439-9.

However, because the book was a complete novelty, it was rejected by one publisher after another.  When, after six months, ''King Solomon's Mines'' finally was published, the book became the year's best seller; the only problem (much to the chagrin of those who had rejected the manuscript) was how to print copies fast enough.<ref name=Monsman/>

In the process, ''King Solomon's Mines'' created a new genre, known as the "[[Lost World (genre)|Lost World]]", which would inspire [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' ''[[The Land That Time Forgot (novel)|The Land That Time Forgot]]'', [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'', [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Man Who Would Be King]]''<ref>Robert E. Morsberger, "Afterword" in ''King Solomon's Mines'' ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' edition 1994. ISBN 0-89577-553-0</ref> and [[HP Lovecraft]]'s ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]''. [[Lee Falk]]'s ''[[The Phantom]]'' was initially written in this genre. A much later Lost World novel was [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[Congo (novel)|Congo]]'', which involves a quest for King Solomon's lost mines, supposedly located in a lost African city called [[Congo (novel)|Zinj]].

As in ''Treasure Island'', the narrator of ''King Solomon's Mines'' tells his tale in the first person in an easy conversational style. Almost entirely missing (except in the speech of the Kukuanas) is the ornate language usually associated with novels of this era. Haggard's use of the first person subjective perspective also contrasts with the omniscient third-person viewpoint then in vogue among influential writers such as [[Anthony Trollope|Trollope]], [[Thomas Hardy|Hardy]], and [[George Eliot|Eliot]]. With its central "[[quest]]" motif and its richly [[mythopoeia|mythopoeic]] imagery, the book has also provided abundant material for psychologists, notably [[Carl Jung|Jung]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]].<ref>Norman A. Etherington "Rider Haggard, Imperialism, and the Layered Personality"  Victorian Studies , Vol. 22, No. 1 (Autumn, 1978), pp. 71<U+2013>87</ref>

The book has scholarly value for the [[colonialism|colonialist]] attitudes Haggard expresses,<ref>Etheridge, ibid., pp. 91<U+2013>106</ref> and for the way he portrays the relationships among the white and African characters. While Haggard does indeed portray some Africans (such as Twala and Gagool) in their traditional (for Victorian literature) literary posts as barbarians, he also presents the other side of the coin, showing some black Africans as heroes and heroines (such as Ignosi), and shows respect for their culture. Although the book is certainly not devoid of racism, it expresses much less prejudice than some of the later books in this genre. Indeed, Quatermain states that he refuses to use the word "nigger" and that many Africans are more worthy of the title of "gentleman" than the Europeans who settle or adventure in the country.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2166/2166-h/2166-h.htm#chap01 Project Gutenberg EBook of King Solomon's Mines] URL accessed 22 February 2009</ref> Haggard even includes an interracial romance between a Kukuana woman, Foulata, and the white Englishman Captain Good. The narrator tries to discourage the relationship, dreading the uproar such a marriage would cause back home in England; however, he has no objection to the lady, whom he considers very beautiful and noble. Haggard soon "kills off" Foulata, but has her die in Good's arms.

Kukuanaland is said in the book to be forty [[League (unit)|leagues]] north of the [[Kafue River|Lukanga river]] in modern Zambia, which would place it in the extreme south-east of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. The culture of the Kukuanas shares many attributes with other South African tribes, such as [[Zulu language|Zulu]] being spoken and the [[kraal]] system being used.

The novel has been adapted to film [[King Solomon's Mines (film)|at least six times]].
