{{Acids and Bases}}
'''pH''' is a measure of the [[acid]]ity or [[Base (chemistry)|basicity]] of a [[solution]]. It is defined as the [[cologarithm]] of the [[Activity (chemistry)|activity]] of dissolved [[hydrogen ion]]s (H<sup>+</sup>). Hydrogen ion [[activity coefficient]]s cannot be measured experimentally, so they are based on theoretical calculations. The pH scale is not an absolute scale; it is relative to a set of standard solutions whose pH is established by international agreement.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.iupac.org/reports/provisional/abstract01/rondinini_prs.pdf|title=The Measurement of pH - Definition, Standards and Procedures] <U+2013> Report of the Working Party on pH, IUPAC Provisional Recommendation |date=2001}} A proposal to revise the current IUPAC 1985 and ISO 31-8 definition of pH.</ref>

The concept of pH was first introduced by [[Danish people|Danish]] [[chemist]] [[S<U+00F8>ren Peder Lauritz S<U+00F8>rensen]] at the [[Carlsberg Laboratory]] in 1909. It is unknown what the exact definition of p is.

Pure water is said to be neutral. The pH for pure water at {{convert|25|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|abbr=on|lk=on}} is close to 7.0. Solutions with a pH less than 7 are said to be [[acidic]] and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are said to be [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] or [[alkaline]]. pH measurements are important in [[medicine]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[food science]], [[environmental science]], [[oceanography]] and many other applications.

== Definitions ==
===pH===
pH is defined as minus the decimal [[logarithm]] of the [[hydrogen ion]] activity in an aqueous solution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/P04524.html|title=pH|work=IUPAC Goldbook}}</ref> By virtue of its logarithmic nature, pH is a [[dimensionless]] quantity.

:<math>\mathrm{pH} = - \log_{10} a_ \mbox{H} = \log_{10} \frac{1}{a_ \mbox{H}}</math>

where ''a''<sub>H</sub> is the (dimensionless) [[activity (chemistry)|activity]] of [[hydrogen ion]]s. The reason for this definition is that ''a''<sub>H</sub> is a property of a single ion which can only be measured experimentally by means of an ion-selective electrode which responds, according to the [[Nernst equation]], to hydrogen ion activity. pH is commonly measured by means of a combined [[glass electrode]], which measures the potential difference, or [[electromotive force]], ''E'', between an electrode sensitive to the hydrogen ion activity and a reference electrode, such as a [[Saturated calomel electrode|calomel electrode]] or a [[silver chloride electrode]]. The combined glass electrode ideally follows the Nernst equation:

:<math> E = E^0 + \frac{RT}{nF} \log_e(a_\mbox{H}); \qquad \mathrm{pH} = \frac{E^0-E}{2.303 RT/F}</math>

where ''E'' is a measured potential , ''E''<sup>0</sup> is the standard electrode potential, that is, the electode potential for the standard state in which the activity is one. ''R'' is the [[gas constant]] ''T'' is the temperature in Kelvin, ''F'' is the [[Faraday constant]] and ''n'' is the number of electrons transferred, one in this instance. The electrode potential, ''E'', is proportional to the logarithm of the hydrogen ion activity.

This definition, by itself, is wholly impractical because the hydrogen ion activity is the product of the [[concentration]] and an [[activity coefficient]]. The single-ion activity coefficient of the hydrogen ion is a quantity which cannot be measured experimentally. To get round this difficulty the electrode is [[calibrate]]d in terms of solutions of known activity. 

The [[operational definition]] of pH is officially defined by International Standard [[ISO 31-8]] as follows: <ref>Quantities and units <U+2013> Part 8: Physical chemistry and molecular physics, Annex C (normative): pH. [[International Organization for Standardization]], 1992.</ref> For a solution X, first measure the electromotive force ''E''<sub>X</sub> of the [[galvanic cell]]
:reference electrode | concentrated solution of KCl || solution X | H<sub>2</sub> | Pt
and then also measure the electromotive force ''E''<sub>S</sub> of a galvanic cell that differs from the above one only by the replacement of the solution X of unknown pH, pH(X), by a solution S of a known standard pH, pH(S). The pH of X is then

:<math> \text{pH(X)} - \text{pH(S)} = \frac{E_\text{S} - E_\text{X} }{2.303RT/F}</math>

The difference between the pH of solution X and the pH of the standard solution depends only on the difference between two measured potentials. Thus, pH is obtained from a potential measured with an electrode calibrated against one or more pH standards; a [[pH meter]] setting is adjusted such that the meter reading for a solution of a standard is equal to the value pH(S). Values pH(S) for a range of standard solutions S, along with further details, are given in the [[IUPAC]] recommendations.<ref>[http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1985/pdf/5703x0531.pdf Definitions of pH scales, standard reference values, measurement of pH, and related terminology]. Pure Appl. Chem. (1985), 57, pp 531<U+2013>542.</ref> The standard solutions are often described as standard buffer solution. In practice it is better to use two or more standard buffers to allow for small deviations from Nernst-law ideality in real electrodes.
Note that because the temperature occurs in the defining equations, the pH of a solution is temperature-dependent.

Measurement of extremely low pH values, such as some very acidic mine waters,<ref> Nordstrom, DK ''et al'' (2000) Negative pH and extremely acidic mine waters from Iron Mountain California. ''Environ Sci Technol'','''34''', 254-258.</ref> requires special procedures. Calibration of the electrode in such cases can be done with standard solutions of concentrated sulfuric acid whose pH values can be calculated with using Pitzer parameters to calculate activity coefficients.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zemaitis|first=J.F.|coauthors=Clark, D.M;  Rafal, M; Scrivner, N.C.|title=Handbook of Aqueous Electrolyte Thermodynamics: Theory & Application|publisher=Wiley|date=1986|isbn=978-0-8169-0350-4}} Chapter 4</ref>

pH is an example of an [[acidity function]]. Hydrogen ion concentrations can be measured in non-aqueous solvents, but this leads, in effect, to a different acidity function because the standard state for a non-aqueous solvent is different from the standard state for water. [[Superacid]]s are a class of non-aqueous acids for which the [[Hammett acidity function]], ''H''<sub>0</sub>, has been developed.

===p[H]===
This was the original definition of S<U+00F8>rensen, <ref name="Sor" /> which was superseded in favour of pH. However, it is possible to measure the concentration of hydrogen ions directly, if the electrode is calibrated in terms of hydrogen ion concentrations. One way to do this, which has been used extensively, is to titrate a solution of known concentration of a strong acid with a solution of known concentration of strong alkali in the presence of a relatively high concentration of background electrolyte. Since the concentrations of acid and alkali are known it is easy to calculate the concentration of hydrogen ions so that the measured potential can be correlated with concentrations. The calibration is usually carried out using a [[Gran plot#electrode calibration|Gran plot]].<ref>{{cite journal| last=Rossotti| first=F.J.C.| coauthors=Rossotti, H.|date=1965|title=Potentiometric titrations using Gran plots: A textbook omission|journal=J. Chem. Ed.|volume=42|pages=375<U+2013>378}}</ref> The calibration yieds a value for the standard electrode potential, ''E''<sup>0</sup>, and a slope factor, ''f'', so that the Nernst equation in the form
:<math>E = E^0 + f\frac{RT}{nF} \log_e[\mbox{H}^+]</math>
can be used to derive hydrogen ion concentrations from experimental measurements of ''E''. The slope factor is usually slightly less than one. A slope factor of less than 0.95 indicates that the electrode is not functioning correctly. The presence of background electrolyte ensures that the hydrogen ion activity coefficient is effectively constant during the titration. As it is constant its value can be set to one by defining the [[standard state]] as being the solution containing the background electrolyte. Thus, the effect of using this procedure is to make activity equal to the numerical value of concentration.

The difference between p[H] and pH is quite small. It has been stated<ref>{{VogelQuantitative}} Section 13.23, "Determination of pH"</ref> that pH = p[H] + 0.04. Unfortunately it is common practice to use the term "pH" for both types of measurement.

=== pOH ===

pOH is sometimes used as a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions, OH<sup>&minus;</sup>, or [[alkalinity]]. pOH is not measured independently, but is derived from pH. The concentration of hydroxide ions in water is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions by

:[OH<sup>&minus;</sup>] = ''K''<sub>W</sub> /[H<sup>+</sup>]

where K<sub>W</sub> is the [[self-ionisation of water|self-ionisation]] constant of water. Taking [[cologarithm]]s

:pOH = p''K''<sub>W</sub> &minus; pH.

So, at room temperature pOH <U+2248> 14 &minus; pH. However this relationship is not strictly valid in other circumstances, such as in measurements of [[Alkali soils|soil alkalinity]].

==Applications==
[[Image:PH scale.png|thumb|350px|right|Some typical pH values]]
<!-- [[Image:PH scale 2.png|thumb|right|Another visual representation of the pH scale.]] -->
Pure water has a pH around 7; the exact values depends on the temperature. When an [[acid]] is dissolved in water the pH will be less than 7 and when a [[base (chemistry)|base]], or [[alkali]] is dissolved in water the pH will be greater than 7. A solution of a strong acid, such as [[hydrochloric acid]], at concentration 1&nbsp;mol dm<sup>-3</sup> has a pH of 0. A solution of a strong alkali, such as [[sodium hydroxide]], at concentration 1&nbsp;mol dm<sup>-3</sup> has a pH of 14. Thus, measured pH values will mostly lie in the range 0 to 14. Since pH is a logarithmic scale a difference of one pH unit is equivalent to a ten-fold difference in hydrogen ion concentration.

Because the glass electrode (and other [[ion selective electrode]]s) responds to activity, the electrode should be calibrated in a medium similar to the one being investigated. For instance, if one wishes to measure the pH of a seawater sample, the electrode should be calibrated in a solution resembling seawater in its chemical composition, as detailed below.

An approximate measure of pH may be obtained by using a [[pH indicator]]. A pH indicator is a substance that changes colour around a particular pH value. It is a [[weak acid]] or [[weak base]] and the colour change occurs around 1 pH unit either side of its [[acid dissociation constant]], or p''K''<sub>a</sub>, value. For example, the naturally occurring indicator [[Litmus test (chemistry)|litmus]] is red in acidic solutions (pH<7) and blue in alkaline (pH>7) solutions. [[Universal indicator]] consists of a mixture of indicators such that there is a continuous colour change from about pH 2 to pH 10. Universal indicator paper is simple paper that has been impregnated with universal indicator.

A solution whose pH is  7 is said to be neutral, that is, it is neither acidic nor basic. Water is subject to a [[Self-ionization of water|self-ionisation]] process.
:H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} H<sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>&minus;</sup>
The dissociation constant, ''K''<sub>W</sub>, has a value of about 10<sup>-14</sup>, so in neutral solution of a salt both the hydrogen ion concentration and [[hydroxide ion]] concentration are about 10<sup>-7</sup> mol dm<sup>-3</sup>.
The pH of pure water decreases with increasing temperatures. For example, the pH of pure water at 50 <U+00B0>C is 6<U+00B7>55. Note, however, that water that has been exposed to air is mildly acidic. This is because water absorbs [[carbon dioxide]] from the air, and carbon dioxide is an acid. After absorption it is slowly converted into the weak acid, [[carbonic acid]], which then dissociates to liberate hydrogen ions. 
:CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> {{eqm}} HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>

== Calculation of pH for weak and strong acids ==
In the case of a strong acid, there is complete dissociation, so the pH is simply equal to minus the logarithm of the acid concentration. For example, a 0.01 [[molar (concentration)|molar]] solution of hydrochloric acid has a pH of &minus;log(0.01), that is, pH = 2.

The pH of a solution of a weak acid may be calculated by means of an [[ICE table]]. For acids with a p''K''<sub>a</sub> value greater than about 2, 

:pH = <U+00BD> ( pK<sub>a</sub> &minus; log c<sub>0</sub>),

where c<sub>0</sub> is the concentration of the acid. This is equivalent to Burrows' weak acid pH equation

:<math>\text{pH} = -\log_{10}\left(\sqrt{K_a c_0}\right)\,</math>

A more general method is as follows. Consider the case of dissolving a [[weak acid]], HA, in water. First write down the equilibrium expression.
:HA <math>\rightleftharpoons</math> A<sup>&minus;</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is specified by
:<math>K_\text{a}=\mathrm{\frac{[A^-][H^+]}{[HA]}}</math>
where [] indicates a concentration. The [[analytical concentration]] of the two reagents, C<sub>A</sub> for [A<sup>&minus;</sup>] and C<sub>H</sub> for [H<sup>+</sup>] must be equal to the sum of concentrations of those species that contain the reagents. C<sub>H</sub> is the concentration of added mineral acid.

:C<sub>A</sub> = [A<sup>&minus;</sup>] + ''K''<sub>a</sub>[A<sup>&minus;</sup>][H<sup>+</sup>]

:C<sub>H</sub> = [H<sup>+</sup>] + ''K''<sub>a</sub>[A<sup>&minus;</sup>][H<sup>+</sup>]

From the first equation

:<math>\mathrm{[A^-]=\frac{\mathit C_A}{1+\mathit K_a[H^+]}}</math>

Substitution of this expression into the second equation gives

:<math>\mathrm{\mathit C_ H=[H^+] + \frac{\mathit K_a \mathit C_A [H^+]}{1+\mathit K_a [H^+]}}</math>

This simplifies to a [[quadratic equation]] in the hydrogen ion concentration

:<math>\mathrm{\mathit K_a[H^+]^2 + \bigg(1+(\mathit C_A-\mathit C_H)\mathit K_a \bigg)[H^+] -\mathit C_H = 0}</math>

Solution of this equation gives [H<sup>+</sup>] and hence pH.

This method can also be used for [[polyprotic]] acids. For example, for the diprotic acid [[oxalic acid]], writing A<sup>2&minus;</sup> for the oxalate ion,

:C<sub>A</sub> = [A<sup>2&minus;</sup>] + &beta;<sub>1</sub>[A<sup>2&minus;</sup>][H<sup>+</sup>] + &beta;<sub>2</sub>[A<sup>2&minus;</sup>][H<sup>+</sup>]<sup>2</sup>

:C<sub>H</sub> = [H<sup>+</sup>] + &beta;<sub>1</sub>[A<sup>2&minus;</sup>][H<sup>+</sup>] + 2&beta;<sub>2</sub>[A<sup>2&minus;</sup>][H<sup>+</sup>]<sup>2</sup>

where <U+03B2><sub>1</sub> and <U+03B2><sub>2</sub> are [[equilibrium constant|cumulative]] protonation constants. Following the same procedure of substituting from the first equation into the second, a [[cubic equation]] in [H<sup>+</sup>] results. In general, the degree of the equation is one more than the number of ionisable protons. The solution of these equations can be obtained relatively easily with the aid of a spreadsheet such as [[EXCEL]] or [[Origin (software)|Origin]].

pH-dependent [[plant pigment]]s that can be used as [[pH indicator]]s occur in many plants, including [[hibiscus]], [[marigold]], [[red cabbage]] ([[anthocyanin]]),<ref>[http://chemistry.about.com/library/weekly/aa012803a.htm chemistry.about.com]</ref> and [[red wine]].

===Seawater ===
The pH of [[seawater]] is very important and there is evidence for [[ocean acidification]]. Distinct pH scales exist depending on the method used to calibrate the electrode.<ref name="zeebe">{{cite book|last=Zeebe|first=R.E.|coauthors=Wolf-Gladrow, D.|title=CO<sub>2</sub> in seawater: equilibrium, kinetics, isotopes|publisher=Elsevier|date=2001|isbn=0 444 50946 1}}</ref>   

#Using [[#definitions|standard buffers]]: The [[ionic strength]] of standard buffer solutions is much lower, at about 0.1 M, than that of seawater, which is about 0.7 M. Consequently they are not recommended for use in measuring the pH of seawater.
#A set of buffers based on [[artificial seawater]] was developed.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Hansson| first=I| date=1973|title=A new set of pH-scales and standard buffers for seawater|journal=Deep Sea Research|volume=20|pages=479<U+2013>491|doi=10.1016/0011-7471(73)90101-0 }}</ref> This pH scale is referred to as the total scale, denoted by pH<sub>T</sub>.

The utility of this scale is limited by the complexity of the calculations. pH values measured on the free scale differ by up to 0.12 pH units from both the total and seawater scales.
#The seawater scale, denoted by pH<sub>SWS</sub> , takes account of the fact that [[hydrogen fluoride]] is a weak acid, H<sup>+</sup> + F<sup><U+2212></sup> {{eqm}} HF. However, the concentration of sulfate ions is about 400 times larger than the concentration of fluoride, so the difference between the total and seawater scales is very small.

The pH of different cellular compartments, [[body fluid]]s, and organs is usually tightly regulated in a process called [[acid-base homeostasis]].

The pH of blood is usually slightly basic with a value of pH 7.4. This value is often referred to as physiological pH in biology and medicine.

[[Dental plaque|Plaque]] can create a local acidic environment that can result in [[tooth decay]] by [[demineralization]].

[[Enzyme]]s and other [[protein]]s have an optimum pH range and can became inactivated or [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] outside this range.

The most common disorder in acid-base homeostasis is [[acidosis]], which means an acid overload in the body, generally defined by pH falling below 7.35.

In the body, pH can be estimated from known [[base excess]] (be) and [[bicarbonate]] concentration (HCO<sub>3</sub>) by the following equation:<ref name=cornell> [http://www-users.med.cornell.edu/~spon/picu/calc/basecalc.htm Medical Calculators > Calculated Bicarbonate & Base Excess] teven Pon, MD, Weill Medical College of Cornell University</ref>
