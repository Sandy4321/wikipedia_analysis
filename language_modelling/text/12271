He was a blogger and chat host on [[mlive.com]] until signing with 97.1 in December 2009. Stone also appears weekly on [[WXYZ-TV]]'s Sunday night sports newscast to offer his editorial opinion on the latest sports issues.

Stone began his sports journalism career as a television producer for [[The George Michael Sports Machine]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. He attended [[American University]] and worked at [[WRC-TV]] for [[George Michael (sportscaster)|George Michael]] after graduating. He came to Detroit to work as the sports producer for [[WDIV-TV]]. He was an original on-air personality of WDFN when it changed its format to all sports on July 11, 1994. He first worked with ''[[Detroit News]]'' reporter [[Rob Parker (sports journalist)|Rob Parker]]. Beginning in the late 1990s, he partnered with ''[[Detroit News]]'' [[columnist]] [[Bob Wojnowski]].  Prior to joining [[WXYT-FM]], Stone worked with [[Detroit Free Press]] columnist [[Mitch Albom]] on [[The Sunday Sports Albom]], Albom's sports talk radio show which at that time was being broadcast on [[WLLZ]], a now defunct Detroit FM rock station.

==The ''Stoney and Wojo'' show==

The ''Stoney and Wojo'' show was a three hour radio [[broadcast]] that included listener call-in segments, regular guests, and [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] talk slanted towards the Detroit and [[Michigan]] sports fan. The tone of ''Stoney and Wojo'' was light-hearted, with Stone playing straight man to Wojo's more clownish comments.  The heart of the show was sports and the breaking news of the Detroit sports market was paramount. Included were interviews, where the professional journalism strengths of both Stone and Wojnowski come to the fore. Occasionally, political news was featured: Governor [[Jennifer Granholm]] appeared several times, for example. 

Stone had a distinctive, entertaining and knowledgeable on-air presence that came to represent WDFN and the Detroit sports market. He often appeared on national media outlets to discuss Detroit sports events, such as the [[Pacers<U+2013>Pistons brawl]]. He had been a guest several times on the nationally syndicated [[Jim Rome Show]]. Additionally, on July 13, 2007 Stoney and Wojo filled in as hosts for [[Jim Rome|Rome]]'s show. 

Stoney and Wojo conducted an annual 28 hour radiothon in support of research for a cure of [[leukemia]] and [[lymphoma]]. The event was started when Sabrina Black, WDFN update reporter, was diagnosed with lymphoma, and continued after her long battle with the disease lead to her passing in 2006. It was typically held in a [[Metro Detroit]] restaurant and includes many regular guest appearances including [[Tony Dungy]] and [[Joe Dumars]], among many others.
 
In August of 2009, rumors of a revived [[WDFN]] live local sports talk line up surfaced; however, in September Stoney and Wojo's time slot was filled by Matt Shepard and Drew Sharp.

In January of 2010 he was listed as a possible replacement to Jay Towers on the 97.1 The Ticket Morning show.
