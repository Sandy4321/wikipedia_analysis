'''Wembley Park tube station''' is a [[London Underground]] station in [[Wembley Park]], [[Greater London]]. The station is served by the Underground's [[Metropolitan Line|Metropolitan]] and [[Jubilee Line|Jubilee]] Lines and is in [[Travelcard]] [[Travelcard Zone 4|Zone 4]]. It is located on Bridge Road (A4089) amd is the nearest Underground station to the [[Wembley Stadium]] and [[Wembley Arena]] complex.

==History==
Tracks were laid through the area by the [[Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railways#Metropolitan Railway|Metropolitan Railway]] (MR, now the Metropolitan Line) when it extended its services from [[Willesden Green tube station|Willesden Green]] to [[Harrow-on-the-Hill tube station|Harrow-on-the-Hill]]. Services to Harrow started on [[2 August]] [[1880]] although Wembley Part station was not constructed until later. 

Wembley Park station was constructed to serve the pleasure grounds developed by the MR at Wembley Park, a former country estate bought by the company  in [[1881]]<ref name=EHO-01>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22465&strquery=Wembley%20Park#p12 English History Online - A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 4 (1971), pp. 198-203]</ref> as a destination for excursion trips on the company's trains. The station opened for the first time on [[14 October]] [[1893]] and initally operated to serve only Saturday football matches in the park. It opened fully on [[12 May]] [[1894]]<ref name=CULG_01>[http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/metropolitan.html Clive's UndergrounD Line Guides - Metropolitan Line]</ref>. Later in the [[1890s]], the [[Great Central Railway]]'s (GCR's) London extension was constructed adjacent to the MR's tracks. The tracks pass under the entrance building but the station has never been served by mainline operators.

In 1905 the tracks were electrified and the first electric trains became operational. Between 1913 and 1915, the MR added additional tracks to double the line's capacity<ref name=DRose>{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Douglas |authorlink= |title=The London Underground, A Diagrammatic History |year=1999 |publisher=Douglas Rose |isbn=1-85414-219-4}}</ref>. On [[10 December]] [[1932]]<ref name=CULG_01>[http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/metropolitan.html Clive's UndergrounD Line Guides - Metropolitan Line]</ref>, the MR opened a branch line north from Wembley Park to [[Stanmore tube station|Stanmore]].

Originally, the MR served all stations south from Wembley Park to [[Baker Street tube station|Baker Street station]] but the line suffered from congestion due to limited capacity on the tracks heading into Baker Street. Following the combination of the MR and London's other underground railways to form the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB) in 1933, the LPTB took steps to alleviate the congestion by constructing new [[Bakerloo Line]] tunnels from Baker Street to connect to the Metropolitan's tracks south of [[Finchley Road tube station|Finchley Road station]]. From [[20 November]] [[1939]]<ref name=CULG_02>[http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/bakerloo.html Clive's UndergrounD Line Guides - Bakerloo Line]</ref>, the Bakerloo Line then took over the Metropolitan stopping services between Wembley Park and Finchley Road and the Stanmore branch.

To handle the exceptional passenger numbers associated with the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Olympics]] held at Wembley stadium, the original station building was extended and given a new ticket hall and additional circulation routes and platform stairs.

At the opening of the Jubilee Line on [[1 May]] [[1979]], the Bakerloo service from Baker Street to Stanmore was transferred to the new line.

In conjunction with the reconstruction of Wembley stadium, the station was again modified. Additional facilities were provided to handle event crowds and a more direct access route to the stadium was constructed.

==Operations==
The station currently has six London Underground tracks, with the two Jubilee Line tracks in the centre flanked in turn by the Slow and Fast Metropolitan Line tracks. Fast trains call at the station only during off-peak periods. Both Metropolitan and Jubilee Line trains may start or end their service at the station. Jubilee Line trains that terminate at Wembley Park reverse via sidings between the running lines to the north of the station.
