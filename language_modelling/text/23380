'''Ockert Wessel "Ockie" Oosthuizen''' (born 1 April 1955 in Johannesburg, South Africa) is a former [[South Africa national rugby union team|South African]] [[Rugby union|rugby]] player. He was capped nine times, scoring one try.

==Rugby career==
He first played for Western Transvaal (now known as the Leopards) as a 20 year old in 1975, and later moved on to provincial giants Northern Transvaal (Blue Bulls) and Transvaal (Golden Lions).<ref>{{af icon}} [http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/rapport/1999/08/29/5/10.html ''OCKIE OOSTHUIZEN: Die korrelkop-stut Rugbypolitiek te veel vir hom'']</ref> He made his international debut against [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] in 1981 and was part of the ill-fated [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand]]. 

Oosthuizen quit rugby in 1985, as he was unhappy with the rugby administration at the time. Along with former Transvaal centre Dries Maritz, he tried to negotiate better financial advantages for their fellow players, which inevitably led to numerous clashes with the powers that be. He later had to appear in front of disciplinary committee after allegations of receiving payment for playing form the ''Rand Afrikaanse Universiteit'' (Rand Afrikaans University, now the [[University of Johannesburg]]).<ref name="Luyt153">Luyt (2003), pg 153.</ref> Although he won the case after an appeal, he was never selected for Transvaal again. He then briefly served as chairman of the now-defunct Randburg RFC, before getting fed up with the politics of the game.

==Life after rugby==
After his retirement from playing, he went into business and became chairman of a company specializing in financial services. In the early 1990s, he got involved in efforts to restart [[rugby league]] in South Africa.
