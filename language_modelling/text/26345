The '''Yugoslav submarine ''Hrabri''''' was a [[submarine]] built by the [[Vickers-Armstrongs|Vickers-Armstrong Naval Yard]], [[River Tyne]], [[United Kingdom]], for the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia) and was launched in 1927. Her design was based on that of the [[British L-class submarine]] of [[World War I]], and she was built using parts originally assembled for an L-class submarine that was never built. During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, she was captured by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian forces]]. She was given the number ''N3'' but was not commissioned and was subsequently scrapped due to her poor condition.

==Description and construction==
''Hrabri'' was built for the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia) by the [[Vickers-Armstrongs|Vickers-Armstrong Naval Yard]], [[River Tyne]], [[United Kingdom]].{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} Her design was based on that of the [[British L-class submarine]] of [[World War I]], and she was built using parts originally assembled for HMAS ''L-67'', which was never built.{{sfn|Akermann|2002|p=168}} Along with her [[sister ship]] ''[[Yugoslav submarine Nebojsa|Nebojsa]]'', she had an [[Length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|72.05|m|ft|abbr=on}}, a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|7.32|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and a surfaced draught of {{convert|3.96|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Her surfaced displacement was {{convert|1164|LT}} ({{convert|1164|LT}} submerged), and her crew consisted of 45 officers and enlisted men. The ship had two shafts driven by two diesel engines or two electric motors. The diesel engines were rated at {{convert|2400|bhp|lk=in|abbr=on}} and the electric motors at {{convert|1600|shp|lk=in|abbr=on}}, and she was designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|15.7|kn|km/h}} under diesel power and {{convert|10|kn|km/h}} on her electric motors. ''Hrabri'' was armed with six bow-mounted {{convert|533|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tubes]],  two {{convert|102|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns (one forward and one [[aft]] of the [[conning tower]]), and one [[machine gun]].{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}}

==Career and fate==
''Hrabri'' was launched in 1927 as the first submarine of the navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which subsequently became the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]].{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}} During the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-led [[Axis Powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, she was captured by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian forces]] at the [[Bay of Kotor]].{{sfn|Bagnasco|1977|p=251}} She was given the number ''N3'' but was not commissioned and was subsequently scrapped later that year due to her poor condition.{{sfn|Fontenoy|2007|p=148}}{{sfn|Chesneau|1980|p=358}}
