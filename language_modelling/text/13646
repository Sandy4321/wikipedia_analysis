'''''Treasure Planet'''''  is a [[2002 in film|2002]] [[United States|American]] [[animated]] [[feature film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] on November 27, 2002. The forty-third [[Animation|animated feature]] in the [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Disney animated features canon]], the film is a [[science fiction]] adaptation of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s adventure [[novel]] ''[[Treasure Island]]'' and was the first film to be released simultaneously in regular and [[IMAX]] theaters.<ref name="bigbang">{{cite web | last = Murray | first = Rebecca | title = John Rzeznik Sets Sail for "Treasure Planet" | date = November 19, 2002  |work = movies.about.com | url =http://movies.about.com/library/weekly/aatreasureplanetsoundtrack.htm | accessdate = 2007-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last =Diorio | first =Carl | title =Big Bang for Disney's 'Planet' | newspaper =[[Daily Variety]] | pages =51 | date =January 25, 2002 | year =2002 }}</ref> The film employs a novel technique of hand-drawn 2D [[traditional animation]] set atop 3D [[computer animation]].

The musical score was composed by [[James Newton Howard]], while the songs were written and performed by [[John Rzeznik]].

==Plot==
The film's prologue depicts Jim Hawkins as a three-year-old (voiced by Austin Majors) reading a storybook in bed.  Jim is enchanted by stories of the legendary [[pirate]] Captain Flint and his ability to appear from nowhere, raid passing ships, and disappear in order to hide the loot on the mysterious "Treasure Planet". Twelve years later, Jim (now voiced by [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]) is shown to have grown into an aloof and alienated teenager. He is shown begrudgingly helping his mother Sarah ([[Laurie Metcalf]]) run an inn and deriving amusement from "solar surfing" (a hybrid of [[skysurfing]] and [[windsurfing]] atop a board attached to a [[solar energy|solar]]-powered [[rocket]]), a pastime that frequently gets him in trouble.

One day, a spaceship crashes near the inn. The dying pilot, Billy Bones ([[Patrick McGoohan]]), gives Jim a [[sphere]] and tells him to "beware the [[cyborg]]". Shortly thereafter, a gang of pirates raid and burn the inn. Jim, his mother, and their dog-like friend Dr. Delbert Doppler ([[David Hyde Pierce]]) barely escape. The sphere turns out to be a holographic projector, showing a map that Jim realizes leads to Treasure Planet.

Doppler commissions a ship called "RLS Legacy" on a mission to find Treasure Planet. The ship is commanded by the cat-like, sharp-witted Captain Amelia ([[Emma Thompson]]) along with her stony-skinned, loyal, and disciplined [[Chief Mate|First Mate]], Mr. Arrow ([[Roscoe Lee Browne]]). The crew is a motley bunch, secretly led by cook John Silver ([[Brian Murray]]), whom Jim suspects is the cyborg of whom he was warned. Jim is sent down to work in the galley; despite his mistrust of Silver, they soon form a tenuous father-son relationship (a montage featuring the song "[[I'm Still Here]]" shows Jim and the cyborg bonding over various sailing chores, interspersed with flashbacks from Jim's childhood, during which his father appears indifferent to him and finally leaves without warning when Jim is a pre-teen). During an encounter with a [[black hole]], Arrow drifts overboard and is lost, for which Jim blames himself for failing to secure the lifelines. Viewers, however, see that Arrow's line was cut by a ruthless [[insectoid]] crew member named Scroop ([[Michael Wincott]]).

As the ship reaches Treasure Planet, [[mutiny]] erupts, led by Silver. Jim, Doppler, and Amelia abandon the ship, accidentally leaving the map behind. Silver, who believes that Jim has the map, has a chance to kill Jim, but refuses to do so because of his attachment to the boy. The fugitives are shot down by a mutineer during their escape, causing injury to Amelia.

While exploring Treasure Planet's forests, the fugitives meet B.E.N ([[Martin Short]]), an abandoned, whimsical robot who claims to have lost most of his memory, and who invites them to his house to care for the wounded Amelia. The pirates corner the group here; using a back-door, Jim and B.E.N. return to the ship in an attempt to recover the map. Scroop, aboard the ship as lookout, stalks and fights Jim. B.E.N., working to sabotage the ship's artillery, accidentally turns off the artificial [[gravity]], whereupon Jim and Scroop threaten to float off into [[space]]. Jim grabs the mast while Scroop becomes entangled in the flag and cuts himself free; no longer connected to the ship, Scroop floats away, presumably to his death. Jim and B.E.N. obtain the map. Upon their return, they are captured by Silver, who has already captured Doppler and Amelia.

When Jim is forced to use the map, the group finds their way to a metaphysical portal that can be opened to any place in the [[universe]]; this being the means by which Flint conducted his raids. The treasure is at the center of the planet, accessible only via the portal. Treasure Planet is revealed to be a large, complex [[space station]] built by unknown architects and commandeered by Flint. In the stash of treasure, Jim comes across the skeletal remains of Flint himself, holding a missing part of B.E.N's cognitive computer. Jim replaces this piece, causing B.E.N. to remember that the planet is set to explode upon the treasure's discovery. In the ensuing catastrophe, Silver finds himself torn between holding onto a literal boat-load of gold and saving Jim, who hangs from a precipice after a fall. Silver saves Jim, and the group escapes to the Legacy, which is damaged and lacks the motive power required to leave the planet in time to escape. Jim attaches a rocket to a narrow plate of [[metal]] and rides it toward the portal to open it to a new location while Doppler pilots the ship behind him. Jim manages to open the portal to his home world's spaceport, through which all escape the destruction of Treasure Planet.

After the escape, Amelia has the surviving pirates imprisoned aboard ship and offers to recommend Jim to the Interstellar Academy for his heroic actions. Silver sneaks below deck, where Jim finds him preparing his escape. Jim lets him go, inheriting Silver's shape-changing pet called Morph (Dane A. Davis). Silver predicts that Jim will "rattle the stars", then tosses him a handful of jewels and gold he had taken from Treasure Planet to pay for rebuilding the inn. The film ends with a party at the rebuilt inn, showing Doppler and Amelia now married with children, and Jim a military cadet. He looks to the skies and sees an image of Silver in the clouds.

==Production==
=== Development ===
''Treasure Planet''  took roughly four and a half years to create, but the concept for ''Treasure Planet'' (which was called "Treasure Island in Space" at the time) was originally [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] by Ron Clements in 1985 during the meeting wherein he and John Musker also pitched ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''.<ref name="scenefilm">{{cite web | last = Everett | first = Clayton | title = Treasure Island as it has never been seen before | work = www.scene-magazine.com | date = June 6, 2002 | url = http://www.scene-magazine.com/archive/filmarchive.php?filmarcid=38 | accessdate = 2008-11-06}}</ref><ref name="commentary">{{cite video | people =Ron Clements, Roy Conli, Dan Cooper, Roy Disney, Ian Gooding, Glen Keane, John Musker, John Ripa | title =Treasure Planet DVD Bonus Materials: Visual Commentary | medium =DVD | publisher =[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] | year = 2003 }}</ref> Clements stated that [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], who was the chief of Disney Animation at the time, "just wasn't interested" in the idea.<ref name="ew">{{Citation | last =  | first =  | author-link =  | title = Treasure Planet | newspaper = Entertainment Weekly | issue=668-668 |pages = 64 | year = 2002 | date = August 2002}}</ref> Since Musker and Clements wanted to be able to move "the camera around a lot like Steven Spielberg or James Cameron," the delay in production was beneficial since "the technology had time to develop in terms of really moving the camera."<ref name="ign">{{cite web | last = B. | first = Scott | title = An Interview with Ron Clements and John Musker | work = movies.ign.com | date = November 27, 2002 | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/378/378511p1.html | accessdate = 2008-11-07}}</ref> Principal animation for the film began in 2000 with roughly 350 crew members working on it.<ref name="techtreasure">{{Citation | last =Ferguson | first =Amy | author-link =Amy Ferguson | title =Technological Treasure: Disney's planet breaks new ground in animation.(Walt Disney Pictures)('Treasure Planet') | journal=[[Film Journal International]] | volume=105 | pages =16<U+2013>17 | year =2002 | date =November 2002 }}</ref> In 2002, Roy Conli estimated that there were around 1,027 crew members listed in the screen credits with "about four hundred artists and computer artists, about a hundred and fifty musicians and another two hundred technologists".<ref name="scenefilm" />

According to Conli, Clements wanted to create a space world that was "warm and had more life to it than you would normally think of in a science fiction film", as opposed to the "stainless steel, blue, smoke coming from the bowels of heavily pipe laden" treatment of science fiction.<ref name="scenefilm" /> In order to make the film "fun" by creating more exciting action sequences and because they believed that having the characters wear space suits and helmets "would take all the romance out of it",<ref name="p9muskerclements">{{cite web | title = TREASURE PLANET Q&A with producers / directors / co-writers RON CLEMENTS & JOHN MUSKER | work = www.phase9.tv | publisher =   | date = 2005 | url = http://www.phase9.tv/moviefeatures/treasureplanetq&a-ronclements&johnmusker1.shtml | format =  | doi =  | accessdate = 2008-12-12 }}</ref> the crew created the concept of the "Etherium," an "outer space filled with atmosphere".<ref>{{cite book | last =Kurtti | first =Jeff | title =Treasure Planet: A Voyage of Discovery | publisher =[[List of assets owned by Disney#Consumer Products|Disney Editions]] | date =October 1, 2002 | pages = | isbn = 0786853662}}</ref><ref name="commentary" />

Several changes were made late in the production to the film. The prologue of the film originally featured an adult Jim Hawkins narrating the story of Captain Flint in [[First-person narrative|first person]],<ref name="commentary" /><ref>{{cite video | people =Ron Clements, John Musker | title =Treasure Planet DVD Bonus Materials: Deleted Scenes - Original Prologue: Adult Jim | medium =DVD | publisher =[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] | year = 2003 }}</ref> but it was considered by the crew to be too "dark" and lacked character involvement.<ref name="commentary" /> The crew also intended for the film to include a sequence showing Jim working on his solar surfer and interacting with an alien child, which was intended to show Jim's more sensitive side and as homage to ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]''.<ref name="jimethan">{{cite video | people =Ron Clements, John Musker | title =Treasure Planet DVD Bonus Materials: Deleted Scenes - Jim Meets Ethan | medium =DVD | publisher =[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] | year = 2003 }}</ref> Because of the intention to begin the film with a scene of Jim solar surfing, the sequence had to be cut.<ref name="jimethan" />

=== Writing ===
Writer Rob Edwards stated that "it was extremely challenging" to take a classic novel and set it in outer space, and that they did away with some of the science fiction elements ("things like the metal space ships and the coldness") early on. Edwards goes on to say that they "did a lot of things to make the film more modern" and that the idea behind setting the movie in outer space was to "make the story as exciting for kids now as the book was for kids then".<ref name="edwards">{{cite web | last = Lee | first = Alana | title = Rob Edwards: Treasure Planet | work = www.bbc.co.uk | date =  | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2003/02/04/rob_edwards_treasure_planet_interview.shtml | accessdate = 2008-11-05}}</ref>

With regard to adapting the characters from the book to film, Ron Clements mentioned that the Jim Hawkins in the book is a "a very smart, very capable kid", but they wanted to make Jim start out as "a little troubled kid" who "doesn't really know who he is" while retaining the aforementioned characteristics from the original character. The "mentor figures" for Jim Hawkins in the novel were Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey, whom John Musker described as "one is more comic and the other's very straight"; these two characters were fused into Dr. Doppler. Clements also mentions that though the father-son relationship between Jim Hawkins and John Silver was present "to some degree" in the book, they wanted to emphasize it more in the film.<ref name="white" />

=== Casting ===
Casting director Ruth Lambert held a series of casting auditions for the film in [[New York]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[London]], but the crew already had some actors in mind for two of the major characters.<ref name="p9conli">{{cite web | title = TREASURE PLANET Q&A with producer ROY CONLI | work = www.phase9.tv | publisher =  | date = 2005 | url = http://www.phase9.tv/moviefeatures/treasureplanetq&a-royconli1.shtml | format =  | doi =  | accessdate = 2008-12-12 }}</ref> The character of Dr. Doppler was written with David Hyde Pierce in mind,<ref name="scenefilm" /><ref name="white">{{cite web | last = White | first = Cindy | title = The creators of Treasure Planet sail the animated spaceways | work = www.scifi.com | date = November 25, 2002 | url = http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw9163.html | accessdate = 2008-11-05}}</ref> and Pierce was given a copy of the ''Treasure Planet'' script along with preliminary sketches of the character and the movie's scenic elements while he was working on ''[[A Bug's Life]].'' He stated that "the script was fantastic, the look was so compelling" that he accepted the role.<ref name="joblo">{{cite web | last = Gunn | first = John | title = Interviews: Treasure Planet | work = www.joblo.com | date = November 28, 2002 | url = http://www.joblo.com/index.php?id=1118 | accessdate = 2008-11-05}}</ref> Likewise, the character of Captain Amelia was developed with the idea that Emma Thompson would be providing her voice. "We offered it to her and she was really excited," Clements said. "She sent us a lovely note saying 'I get to do an action film without having a [[Train (clothing)|train]] at all!'"<ref name="ign" /> There were no actors initially in mind for the characters of John Silver and Jim Hawkins, but the crew settled on Brian Murray as John Silver and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Jim Hawkins after months of auditions.<ref name="scenefilm" /> Gordon-Levitt stated that he was attracted to the role because "it's a Disney animated movie and Disney animated movies are in a class by themselves," and that "to be part of that tradition is unbelievable to me".<ref name="gordon-levitt">{{cite web | last = Lee | first = Alana | title = Joseph Gordon-Levitt: Treasure Planet | work = www.bbc.co.uk | date =  | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2003/02/04/joseph_gordon_levitt_treasure_planet_interview.shtml | accessdate = 2008-11-05}}</ref> Musker mentioned that Gordon-Levitt "combined enough vulnerability and intelligence and a combination of youthfulness but incompleteness" and that they liked his approach.<ref name="white" />

Among the lead actors, only Pierce had experience with voice acting prior to the making of ''Treasure Planet''. Conli explained that they were looking for "really the natural voice of the actor", and that sometimes it was better to have an actor with no experience with voice work as he utilizes his natural voice instead of "affecting a voice".<ref name="scenefilm" /> The voice sessions were mostly done without any interaction with the other actors,<ref name="joblo" /><ref name="white" /> but Gordon-Levitt expressed a desire to interact with Brian Murray because he found it difficult to act out most of the scenes between Jim Hawkins and John Silver alone.<ref name="white" />

=== Design and animation ===
While designing for ''Treasure Planet'', the crew operated on rule they call the "70/30 Law" (an idea that art director Andy Gaskill has credited to Ron Clements), which meant that the overall look of the film's artwork should be 70% traditional and 30% [[sci-fi]].<ref>{{cite video | people =Andy Gaskill, Ian Gooding | title =Treasure Planet DVD Bonus Materials: The 70/30 Law | medium =DVD | publisher =[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] | year = 2003 }}</ref> The overall look of ''Treasure Planet'' was based on the art style promoted by illustrators associated with the [[Brandywine School|Brandywine School of Illustration]] (such as [[Howard Pyle]] and [[N.C. Wyeth]]), whose illustrations have been described by the film's crew as being the "classic storybook illustration," having a [[painterly]] feel to it, and being composed of a warm color [[palette]].<ref>{{cite video | people =Ron Clements, Dan Cooper, Roy Disney, Andy Gaskill, Ian Gooding, John Musker | title =Treasure Planet DVD Bonus Materials: The Brandywine School | medium =DVD | publisher =[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] | year = 2003 }}</ref> The animators took ''Deep Canvas'', a technology which they had initially been developed for ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'', and came up with a process they called "Virtual Sets," wherein they created entire 360 [[Degree (angle)|degree]] sets before they began staging the scenes.<ref name="scenefilm" /> They combined this process with traditionally-drawn characters in order to achieve a "painted image with depth perception" and enabled the crew to place the camera anywhere in the set and maneuver it as they would maneuver a camera for a live-action film.<ref name="techtreasure" /> In order to test how a computer-generated body part (specifically John Silver's cyborg arm) would mesh with a traditionally animated character, the crew took a clip of [[Captain Hook]] from [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|''Peter Pan'']] and replaced his arm with the cyborg arm.<ref>{{cite video | people =Glen Keane | title =Treasure Planet DVD Bonus Materials: The "Hook" Test | medium =DVD | publisher =[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] | year = 2003 }}</ref>

There were around forty animators on the crew, and were further divided into teams; for example, sixteen animators were assigned to Jim Hawkins because he appeared on the screen the most, and twelve were assigned to John Silver. To ensure "solidity" in illustration and personality, each major character in the film had a team of animators led by one supervisor. Conli mentioned that the personalities of the supervisors affect the final character, giving Glen Keane (the supervisor for John Silver) as well as John Ripa (the supervisor for Jim Hawkins) as examples. The physical appearance, movements, and facial expressions of the voice actors were infused into the characters as well.<ref name="scenefilm" />

When asked if they drew inspiration from the previous film adaptations of ''Treasure Island'' for the character designs, Glen Keane stated that he disliked looking at previous portrayals of the character in order to "clear his mind of stereotypes", but that he drew some inspiration for the manner by which Silver spoke from actor [[Wallace Beery]], whom he "loved because of the way he talked out of the side of his mouth." For the characterization and design for Jim Hawkins, John Ripa cited [[James Dean]] as an important reference because "there was a whole attitude, a posture" wherein "you felt the pain and the youthful innocence", and he also cited the film ''[[Braveheart]]'' because "there are a lot of close-ups on characters...who are going through thought processes, just using their eyes."<ref name="p9keaneandripa">{{cite web | title = TREASURE PLANET Q&A with animators JOHN KEANE & JOHN RIPA

=== Music and sound ===
This "70/30 Law" was not only applied to the visual designs for the film, but also for the sound effects and music. Sound designer Dane Davis mentioned that he and his team "scoured hobby shops and junk stores for antique windup toys and old spinning mechanisms" in order to create the sound effects for John Silver to "avoid sounding slick or sci-fi". The team did some experimentation with the sound used in dialogues, especially with the robot B.E.N., but opted to keep the actor's (Martin Short's) natural voice because everything they tried "affected his comedy", and "the last thing you want to do in a story like this is affect performances".<ref name="sound">{{cite web | last = Droney | first = Maureen | title = Avast and Away! | work = mixonline.com | date = January 1, 2003 | url = http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_avast_away/ | accessdate = 2008-11-07}}</ref>

The music from the movie is largely orchestral in nature, although it includes two moderately successful pop singles ("[[I'm Still Here]]" and "Always Know Where You Are") from [[The Goo Goo Dolls]] [[frontman]] [[John Rzeznik]] and British pop-rock group, [[BBMak]]. Both songs were written and performed by John Rzeznik in the film, but BBMak recorded "Always Know Where You Are" for the soundtrack. The [[musical score|score]] was composed by [[James Newton Howard]], who said that the score is "very much in the wonderful tradition of [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold|Korngold]] and [[Dimitri Tiomkin|Tiomkin]] and [[Max Steiner|Steiner]]."<ref>{{Citation | last =Flick | first =Larry | title =Soundtracks | newspaper =[[Billboard]] | pages =16 | year =2002 | date =December 7, 2002}}</ref> The score has been described as a mixture of modern music in the spirit of [[Star Wars]] and [[Celtic music]].<ref name="klein"/><ref>{{cite web | last =Brennan | first =Mike | title =Soundtrack.Net: Treasure Planet Soundtrack | date = April 12, 2005  | work=www.soundtrack.net| url =http://www.soundtrack.net/soundtracks/database/?id=3291 | accessdate = 2007-08-04 }}</ref> Scottish fiddler [[Alasdair Fraser]] is credited as the co-composer of the track "Silver Leaves",<ref>{{cite web | last =  | first =  | title = Treasure Planet Soundtrack - James-Newton-Howard.com | work = www.james-newton-howard.com | date = October 30, 2005 | url = http://www.james-newton-howard.com/main.html?/discography/treasureplanet.html | accessdate = 2008-11-05}}</ref> and is also listed as a soloist in the film's credits.

== Release ==
''Treasure Planet'' is "the first major studio feature" to be released in regular and [[IMAX]] theaters simultaneously. This was done in the light of the success of Disney films that were re-released in IMAX format, such as ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'' and ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''.<ref name="bigbang" /> [[Dick Cook]], chairman of [[Walt Disney Studios]], also mentioned that the simultaneous release was a good way to distinguish themselves during the competitive holiday season.<ref name="ew" />

== Critical reaction ==
The overall critical reaction to the film was mixed. Several critics panned the film, among them being renowned film critic [[Roger Ebert]], who said that a more traditional take on the film would have been "more exciting" and "less gimmicky".<ref name="egbert">{{cite web | last =Ebert| first =Roger |authorlink =Roger Ebert| title =Treasure Planet | date = November 27, 2002 | work=rogerebert.suntimes.com | url =http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021127/REVIEWS/211270302/1023 | accessdate = 2007-08-18}}</ref> Andy Klein of ''[[Daily Variety|Daily Variety Gotham]]'' complained about the script, describing it as "listless" and remarked, "If only its script were as amusing as its visuals."<ref name="klein">{{Citation | last =Klein| first =Andy | title =Film Review: Treasure Planet | newspaper =[[Daily Variety|Daily Variety Gotham]] | pages =14 | year =2002 | date =November 25, 2002}}</ref>  [[A.

==Other media==
Before ''Treasure Planet'' was shown in cinemas, [[Thomas Schumacher]], the president of [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], mentioned the possibilities of having direct-to-video releases for ''Treasure Planet'' as well as a television series. He stated that they already had "a story and some storyboards and concepts up and a script for what a sequel to [Treasure Planet] could be," and that they also had a "notion" of what the series would be.<ref>{{cite web | last = Tomooka | first = Jennifer | title = Future TREASURE PLANET projects could be in the works | work = www.mania.com | date = October 16, 2002 | url = http://www.mania.com/future-treasure-planet-projects-could-works_article_36554.html | accessdate = 2008-11-05}}</ref>
