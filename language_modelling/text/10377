'''Billy Talent''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] rock band formed in [[1993 in music|1993]] in [[Mississauga, Ontario]]. The band consists of [[Benjamin Kowalewicz]] ([[lead vocals|vocals]]), [[Ian D'Sa]] ([[lead guitar|guitar]]/[[backing vocals|vocals]]), [[Jonathan Gallant]] ([[Bass guitar|bass]]/[[backing vocals|vocals]]), and [[Aaron Solowoniuk]] ([[Drum kit|drums]]/[[percussion]]).

Although they are often described as having [[punk rock]] roots, the band claims that they have no bands that they have drawn inspiration from; they did not "emulate popular bands at the time." The sound is original and unique, something different that they recognized when they first started playing together.<ref name=MuchBio>[http://www.muchmusic.com/music/artists/bio.asp?artist=785 Artist Bio: Billy Talent].

The band existed for almost a decade before hitting mainstream success. The members met and played in high school under the name Pezz, and remained underground in [[Toronto]]'s indie music scene until 2001. The band renamed itself Billy Talent after running into legal trouble with the old name. It was then that Kowalewicz's connection with a worker in [[Warner Music Canada]]'s [[A&R]] landed the band a record deal and launched them into mainstream success.<ref name=Accessmag>Bliss, Karen.

==History==
===Origins as Pezz: 1993&ndash;1998===
The band originated in [[Meadowvale, Ontario|Meadowvale]] and [[Streetsville]], two neighbouring districts in [[Mississauga, Ontario]]. In 1993, [[Ben Kowalewicz]] and [[Jon Gallant]] were part of a band called "To Each His Own", where Gallant played bass, and Kowalewicz was on drums. Kowalewicz moved to vocals, and [[Aaron Solowoniuk]] was recruited in his place. Then backstage at the talent show of their high school, [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel Secondary School|Our Lady of Mount Carmel Secondary]], they met [[Ian D'Sa]], who played with a different band by the name of "Dragonflower".<ref name=BeforeFamous>"Before They Were Famous". [http://www.edge102.com/station/ongoing_history_of_new_music.cfm The Ongoing History of New Music]. Aired [[November 11]], [[2005]] on [[CFNY]].</ref> The two bands started playing local pool halls and bars together. Eventually Kowalewicz asked D'Sa about starting a new band with him, Gallant, and Solowoniuk. He wanted to make a band that focused more on creativity, and D'Sa agreed.<ref name=MuchBio/> This merger would bring on the name "The Other One" for a short time, and eventually '''Pezz'''.<ref name=BeforeFamous/>

{{Sound sample box align right|Music sample:}}
{{Listen|filename=Pezz - M & M.ogg|title="M & M"|description=A sample of "M & M" from the album ''[[Watoosh!]]'', the band's first album. This song was about a bunch of [[Goth subculture|goth kids]] that came into the record store where Kowalewicz worked.<ref name=BeforeFamous/> They were still known as '''Pezz''' at this time, and the different name carried a different sound and style. |format=[[Ogg]]}}
{{sample box end}}

Pezz began writing, performing songs, and gaining attention and credibility at first locally, and soon in [[Toronto]]'s broader [[Independent music|indie music]] scene. Their first recording was a cheap 4-track demo. It was recorded in Ian D'Sa's basement in July of 1994, and was named ''[[Demoluca]]'', after a friend of the band named Jason Deluca had stopped by the house, banging on a basement window while the band was recording.  Soon after, in January 1995, they all put in money to record another demo of better quality with engineer/producer Dave Tedesco at the "Signal to Noise" studio which they called ''[[Dudebox]]''.<ref name=BeforeFamous/> Originally, two tracks from ''Demoluca'' and four newly recorded tracks were compiled onto it, but a year later the band recorded four more tunes live in the studio and re-released it. After these releases and their continued performances in the immediate area, Pezz was gaining a following in Mississauga and it continued to spread.<ref name=PezzBio>Bowman, Trevor. "[http://www.billytalent.com/pezz/bio.html BIO]", billytalent.com. Retrieved on [[September 4]], [[2007]].</ref>

Eventually the boys left high school and had to move onto other head spaces. D'Sa studied classical animation at [[Sheridan College]], and even worked on [[Angela Anaconda]] as an animator. Gallant almost finished a business degree. Kowalawicz was inbetween jobs, one which included working at [[CFNY-FM|102.1 the edge]]. Solowoniuk worked at [[Chrysler Canada]]. But during all this, the each member found the time and finances to max-out their credit cards, and record their first full-length album in 1998.<ref name=BeforeFamous/> They laid down twelve tracks at a studio called "Great Big Music", collaborating with [[Juno Award|Juno]]-nominated [[music producer]] [[Brad Nelson]]. Kowalawicz started singing in melody with D'Sa. The music began to transform from a "raw rap-rock" songs into "catchy and angst-ridden pop punk anthems". With that, ''[[Watoosh!]]'' was born and independently released.<ref name=PezzBio/> While popular within Toronto's [[indie (music)|indie]] scene, it did not reach large mainstream sales levels.<ref name=BeforeFamous/>

===Billy Talent and mainstream success: 1999&ndash;2004===
In 1999, Pezz ran into some legal trouble over their name. In time, the band relented, and soon renamed themselves Billy Talent in 2001. The name was inspired by "Billy Tallent",<!-- This is the name of the character in Hard Core Logo, and is PROPERLY SPELLED WITH 2 L's. Do not be mistaken and change it to one L --> the name of a guitarist in ''[[Hard Core Logo]]'', a novel by [[Michael Turner (musician)|Michael Turner]] with a film adaptation by [[Bruce McDonald]].<ref name=BeforeFamous/><ref name=Accessmag/> However, this still led to fans mistaking Kowalewicz of being named Billy Talent.<ref name=ProudofBTII>Wood, Sherry.

{{Listen|filename=Billy Talent - Try Honesty.ogg|title="Try Honesty"|description=A sample of "Try Honesty" from Billy Talent's [[Billy Talent (album)|self-titled album]], the band's first album under the name. The album showed evidence of being more aggressive and influenced by punk rock.<ref name=Accessmag/> |format=[[Ogg]]}}
{{sample box end}}

Now known as Billy Talent, their sound began to move in a more aggressive, punk rock direction. During this time, Kowalewicz ran into a co-worker, Jen Hirst, at [[CFNY-FM|102.1 the edge]], the Toronto radio station he worked at. She had previously seen the band perform as Pezz, and he asked her to check out the band's performance at a club. This would prove to pay off, as Hirst was later hired by [[Warner Music Canada]] to work in [[A&R]]. This connection would get the band their producer [[Gavin Brown]], and a demo deal with the label. Before the demos were recorded, a local manager called [[Atlantic Records]] A&R executives, who were already in Toronto, to see the band perform in its tiny rehearsal space.<ref name=Accessmag/> The demos were recorded and released as a four song EP, ''[[Try Honesty EP|Try Honesty]]'', in September 2001. 

In 2002, the band met with record executives, and ended up signing a co-venture agreement with [[Atlantic Records]] and [[Warner Music Canada]].<ref name=Accessmag/> In the fall of 2003, the band released their full-length self-titled album, ''[[Billy Talent (album)|Billy Talent]]''. The album found considerable mainstream airplay and sales success. "[[Try Honesty]]" was a successful first single, and was followed by other singles "[[The Ex]]", "[[River Below]]", and "[[Nothing To Lose]]" into late 2003 and 2004. The band played sold-out shows in Canada and the United States and had success in [[Europe]] as well. The band received [[Juno Award|Juno]] and [[MuchMusic Video Award]] nominations and awards, and spent late 2004 and most of 2005 touring. ''Billy Talent'' went on to be certified 3x Platinum in Canada.<ref name=CRIA0107/>

A track from the album was titled "This Is How It Goes", and it was about one of Kowalewicz's friends who had [[multiple sclerosis]]. On [[March 17]], [[2006]], Aaron Solowoniuk revealed in a personal letter to fans that the friend in that song was him. Solowoniuk was confirmed to have the disease, which causes anything from numbness in the limbs to paralysis or loss of vision, in January 1999. His [[neurologist]] prescribed him medication that he would have to self inject himself with three times a week, possibly for the rest of his life. Although it was a struggle for Solowoniuk to come to terms with the reality of the disease, going to numerous doctor appointments, and touring with the band with a mini-fridge in their van has become normal routine. The medication has let him continue drumming with the band, as it eliminated his symptoms, and he has stated that "this changes nothing about my band or me."<ref>[http://www.billytalent.com/tool/display_newsbt_new.jsp?id=2537 Personal letter from Aaron] ([[March 17]], [[2006]]).
