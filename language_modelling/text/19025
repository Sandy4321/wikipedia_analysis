The '''Battle of al-Mazra'a''' ({{lang-ar|<U+0645><U+0639><U+0631><U+0643><U+0629> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0645><U+0632><U+0631><U+0639><U+0629>}}) was one of the major battles of the [[Great Syrian Revolt]], that led to the spread of the rebellion throughout the [[French Mandate of Syria]]. It was fought on 2<U+2013>3 August 1925 between [[Druze]] and [[Bedouin]] rebels led by [[Sultan Pasha al-Atrash]] and a heavily-armed French force of the [[Army of the Levant]] near the town of [[al-Mazraa]], around {{convert|12|km}} northwest of the city of [[al-Suwayda]].<ref name="Betts139">Betts, 2010, p. 139.</ref>

==Prelude==
[[France]] established its [[French Mandate of Syria|Mandate in Syria]] in 1920 following the [[Allied Forces|Allied]] victory over the [[Ottoman Empire]] during [[World War I]] in which France gained the territory of modern-day Syria. French authority over the area was finalized after their decisive victory over [[Faisal I|Emir Faisal]]'s [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] forces in the [[Battle of Maysalun]] on 24 July 1920. The French authorities divided the territory of Syria into separate autonomous entities based on the different sects in the country, including the [[Jabal al-Druze]] area of [[Hauran]] with its [[Druze]] majority of 90%.<ref>Betts, 2010, pp. 85-86.</ref> While the Druze, unlike their [[Arab Christian]] and [[Sunni Muslim|Arab Sunni]] counterparts, were not as active in the [[Syrian nationalism|Syrian nationalist movement]] during the early years of the Mandate, they feared the consequences of French rule. Because of their [[1860 conflict in Lebanon|conflict]] with the Maronites of Lebanon who maintained close ties with the French before World War I, the Druze leadership worried about faring poorly under French authority.<ref>Betts, p. 85.</ref> 

In the beginning years, the Druze under the leadership of the [[al-Atrash]] family were satisfied with the idea of autonomous rule, but disagreements with the authorities arose relating to the extent of Druze independence, the powers of the al-Atrash over Jabal al-Druze and the overriding power of the mandate authorities.<ref>Betts, 2010, p. 86.</ref> Conflicts between the French authorities and the Druze of Hauran arose in July 1922 after the latter agreed to protect the Lebanese rebel [[Adham Khanjar]] who allegedly attempted to assassinate High Commissioner [[Henri Gouraud]]. When Khanjar was apprehended near Sultan Pasha al-Atrash's home in [[al-Qurayya]], Druze fighters attacked the arresting authorities, killing a lieutenant. After the French appointed army officer Captain Carillet as governor of Jabal al-Druze in violation of the 1921 French-Druze Agreement which stipulated that a Druze be in charge, tensions between al-Atrash and the authorities increased, particularly after October 1924. General tensions relating to the success of French taxation and attempts to instill the values of French society through the building of secular schools, courts and roads led to resentment by the Druze inhabitants.<ref>Betts, 2010, p. 87</ref> 

After the high commissioner, General [[Maurice Sarrail]] arrested and banished three Druze [[sheikh]]s to [[Palmyra]] on 11 July 1925, Sultan al-Atrash launched a rebellion which became known as the [[Great Syrian Revolt]]. After shooting down a number of French military planes, al-Atrash's forces destroyed a French Army reinforcement column in the [[Battle of al-Kafr]] on 21 July.<ref name="Betts88">Betts, 2010, p. 88.</ref>

==The battle==
Following their defeat at [[al-Kafr]], the French General Michaud assembled his troops in Damascus to launch a punitive expedition against the Druze. The total number of troops has also been estimated at 3,500.<ref name="Provence63">Provence, 2005, p. 63.</ref> By 29 July, al-Atrash's rebel fighters destroyed railroad tracks at [[al-Mismiyya]] between [[Damascus]] and [[Daraa]] and parts of the paved road between [[Izra']] and [[al-Suwayda]], slowing the advance of Michaud's troops.<ref name="Provence63"/> In the town of Izra' the French garrison finally mobilized a force consisting of roughly 1,000 French soldiers and about 2,000 Syrian and French African soldiers.<ref name="Betts88"/> Their convoy was made up five infantry battalions, three squadrons of cavalry on the flanks, backed by armored vehicles and artillery at the rear. On 31 July the French army began its march through the midsummer heat, first entering the town of [[Busra al-Harir]] which had been experiencing a drought.<ref name="Provence63"/>  

The French reached the agricultural town of [[al-Mazraa]] at the base of Jabal al-Druze after a march of 25 kilometers on 2 August. The terrain consisted of largely flat open areas with little vegetation. Movement in al-Mazraa could be easily detected from the slopes of Jabal al-Druze and al-Atrash was able to plainly view the French force when they stopped in the town.<ref name="Provence63"/> Al-Atrash's cavalry, which consisted of roughly 500 Druze and [[Bedouin]] fighters, subsequently assaulted the French convoy, inflicting moderate casualties before being routed.<ref name="Provence63"/> 

Afterward, in the early hours of 3 August, al-Atrash's men launched a second attack on a supporting [[ammunition column]], forcing it to retreat to Izra'. Consequently, and because of the hot and dry weather conditions, General Michaud also decided to  withdraw to Izra'. Seeing the French column in full retreat, al-Atrash's forces assaulted Michaud's troops, completely routing the French advance on al-Suwayda. The French force's second-in-command Major Jean Aujac and his [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] unit covered Michaud's withdrawal, resulting in the unit's destruction.<ref name="Provence63"/>

Survivors of the Malagasy unit fled while Major Aujac committed suicide on the battlefield by shooting himself.<ref name="Provence63"/> At the end of the battle, over 800 French soldiers and officers had been killed, while much of the remainder of the French forces were captured, although several deserted prior.<ref name="Betts88"/>

==Aftermath==
The battle at al-Mazraa ended in a victory for Sultan al-Atrash, and his men were able to capture 2,000 rifles with ammunition and supplies, several machine guns and an [[artillery battery]].<ref name="Betts88"/><ref>Provence, 2005, pp. 63-64.</ref> Negotiations between the mandatory authorities led by delegation head Captain Raynaud and the Druze sheikhs led by delegation head Hamad al-Atrash began on 11 August. The French demanded the release of all [[prisoners of war|military prisoner]]s and the right to bury their dead that were left on the battlefields of both Kafr and Mazraa. The Druze demanded the release of ten of their own captured from the citadel of al-Suwayda on 3 July and the Druze sheikhs who were imprisoned in Palmyra. On 14 August the prisoner-exchange took place in the Hauran village of [[Umm Walad]] where the negotiations took place. Over 2,000 Druze [[horsemen]] attended the exchange to celebrate the release of their comrades.<ref>Provence, 2005, p. 75.</ref> 

Most of Jabal al-Druze became absent of French authority as a result of the battle, although a French garrison remained in control of al-Suwayda for over a month.<ref name="Betts88"/> Short of supplies, the French departed al-Suwayda by 24 September, leaving much of the town destroyed.<ref>Jacques, 2007, p. 980.</ref> Following his defeat, which brought great embarrassment to Mandate government,<ref name="Betts139"/> General Michaud was recalled to France in disgrace.<ref name="Provence91">Provence, 2005, p. 91.</ref><ref name="Betts88"/> He was replaced General [[Maurice Gamelin]].<ref name="Provence91"/>

The victory of Sultan al-Atrash reached Damascus shortly after the battle's end, inspiring Syrian nationalists in the country's capital and the countryside to join the Druze in their revolt. During the succeeding months, most of the territories under French rule in Syria rose in rebellion.<ref>Provence, 2005, p. 64.</ref> Al-Atrash was regarded as a hero by the people of Jabal al-Druze and nationalists throughout the country. His forces were elevated by the nationalist leadership of Damascus, particularly [[Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar]], to the role of [[Vanguardism|vanguard]] of the nationalist movement for an independent [[Arab]] Syria.<ref name="Betts88"/>
