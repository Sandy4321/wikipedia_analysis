'''Manuel Luis Quezon y Molina''' (b. [[August 19]], [[1878]] in [[Baler, Aurora]], [[Philippines]] - d. [[August 1]], [[1944]] in [[Saranac Lake, New York|Saranac Lake]], [[New York]], [[United States]]) was the first [[Filipino people|Filipino]] president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] under U.S. occupation rule in the early period of the 20th century. He is also considered by most Filipinos, as the second [[President of the Philippines|President]], after [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] (whose administration did not receive international recognition at the time and is not considered the first Philippine president by the [[United States]]). He has the distinction of being the first Senate President elected to the presidency, the first president elected through a national election, and was also the first incumbent to secure re-election (for a partial second term, later extended, due to amendments to the 1935 Constitution).

==Early life and career==
Manuel L. Quezon, a [[Filipino mestizo|Filipino-Spanish mestizo]], was born in [[Baler, Aurora|Baler]], [[Tayabas Province|Tayabas]] (now found at [[Aurora Province|Aurora]]). His parents were [[Lucio Quezon]] and [[Maria Dolores Molina]].  While serving as [[aide-de-camp]] to Emilio Aguinaldo (he had been a  Lieutenant, then a Major, in the Bataan sector during the retreat and surrender in 1901), he fought with Filipino nationalists in the [[Philippine-American War]]. 

He received his primary education from his mother (a Spanish mestiza, and school teacher in their home town) and tutors (his father, a Chinese mestizo from Paco, Manila, was a Sergeant in the [[Spanish Army]]), and later boarded at the [[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]] where he completed secondary school. After the war, he completed Law at the [[University of Santo Tomas]] and passed the bar examinations in 1903, placing fourth.  He worked for a time as a clerk and surveyor, entering government service as an appointed fiscal for Mindoro and later Tayabas. He became a councilor and was elected governor of Tayabas in 1906 as an independent. In 1907, he was elected to the first Philippine Assembly, where he served as majority floor leader and chairman of the committee on appropriations. From 1909-1916, he served as one of the Philippines' two [[resident commissioner]]s to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], lobbying for the passage of the Philippine Autonomy Act or Jones Law.

==Senate Presidency and Independence Missions==
[[Image:Manuel_Quezon_inauguration.JPG|right|190px|thumb|President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] prepares for his inaugural address]]
He was elected senator in 1916 and became Senate President, serving continuously until 1935 (19 years).  He headed the first Independence Mission to the U.S. Congress in 1919, and brought home the Tydings-McDuffie Independence Law in 1934.

While in the United States, he personally met [[Napoleon Hill]] and was inspired to continue seeking the Independence of the Philippines.

==Presidency==
[[Image:Ph_pres_quezon.jpg|thumb|The official Malaca<U+00F1>an Palace portrait of President Quezon from 1935 to 1978]]
In 1935 Manuel L. Quezon won the Philippine's first national presidential election against Emilio Aguinaldo and Bishop [[Gregorio Aglipay]]. His original six-year term, without reelection, was extended by constitutional amendment, allowing him to serve two additional years for a total of eight. He was reelected in November, 1941.  In a notable humanitarian act, Quezon, in cooperation with United States [[High Commissioner of the Philippines|High Commissioner]] [[Paul V. McNutt]], facilitated the entry into the Philippines of [[Jew]]ish refugees fleeing [[fascist]] regimes in Europe. Quezon was also instrumental in promoting a project to resettle the refugees in [[Mindanao]].

==Administration, Cabinet, and Supreme Court appointments 1935-1941==

President Quezon was given the power under the reorganization act, to appoint the first all-Filipino [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] in 1935. From 1901 to 1935, although a Filipino was always appointed chief justice, the majority of the members of the Supreme Court were Americans. Complete Filipinization was achieved only with the establishment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines in 1935. Claro M. Recto and Jose P. Laurel were among Quezon's first appointees to replace the American justices.  The membership in the Supreme Court increased to 11: a chief justice and ten associate justices, who sat en banc or in two divisions of five members each.

==Government-in-exile==

[[Image:Quezon_Roosevelt.jpg|thumb|right|220px|President Quezon, with some of his family members, are welcomed in Washington, D.C. by President Roosevelt]]After the [[Japan|Japanese]] invasion of the Philippines during [[World War II]] he evacuated to Corregidor, then the Visayas and Mindanao, and upon the invitation of the US government, was further evacuated to Australia and then to the United States, where he established the Commonwealth [[government in exile]] with headquarters in Washington, D.C.. There, he served as a member of the [[Pacific War Council]], signed the declaration of the [[United Nations]] against the [[Axis Powers]], and wrote his autobiography (''[[Good Fight]]'', 1946).

Quezon suffered from [[tuberculosis]] and died in [[Saranac Lake, New York|Saranac Lake]], [[New York]] on [[August 1]], [[1944]]. He was initially buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. His body was later carried by the [[USS Princeton (CV-37)]] and re-interred in [[Manila]], at the [[Manila North Cemetery]] and then moved to [[Quezon City]] within the monument at the [[Quezon Memorial Circle]].

Quezon was married to his first cousin, [[Aurora A. Quezon|Aurora Arag<U+00F3>n Quezon]], and had four children: Mar<U+00ED>a Aurora "Baby" Quezon (1919-1949), Mar<U+00ED>a Zeneida "Nini" Quezon Avancena (1921-), Luisa Coraz<U+00F3>n Paz "Nenita" Quezon (1923-1923) and Manuel L. "Nonong" Quezon, Jr. (1926-1998). His grandson, Manuel L. "Manolo" Quezon III (1970-),a prominent writer and political pundit, was named after him.

In their column on the pronunciation of names, ''The [[Literary Digest]]'' wrote "The President and his wife pronounce the name ''keh'-zon''.  The pronunciation ''keh-son','' although widely heard in the Philippine Islands, is incorrect." (Charles Earle Funk, ''What's the Name, Please?'', Funk & Wagnalls, 1936.)

==War Cabinet 1941-1944==
{{Col-begin}}
The outbreak of World War II and the Japanese invasion resulted in periodic and drastic changes to the government structure. Executive Order 390, December 22, 1941 abolished the Department of the Interior and established a new line of succession. Executive Order 396, December 24, 1941 further reorganized and grouped the cabinet, with the functions of Secretary of Justice assigned to the Chief Justice of the Philippines.
