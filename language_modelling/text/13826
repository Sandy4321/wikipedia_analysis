A '''Kobzar''' ({{lang-ua|<U+043A><U+043E><U+0431><U+0437><U+0430><U+0440>}}) was a Ukrainian itinerant [[Cossack]] bard. During battles, some Cossacks would carry [[kobzas]] with them into battle.  They would sing about what they and their companions had done in battle <U+201C>to instill courage for the fight ahead and offering consolation for past losses<U+201D> (Kononeko, p. 566).  Soon, the performers of the dumy became the Cossacks who were injured in battle and could no longer fight. Kobzars  were sometimes blind, but became blind stereotypically by 19th century.  ''Kobzar'' literally means ''one who plays a [[kobza]]'', a Ukrainian stringed instrument.  This tradition was established during the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate Era]] around the 16th century in [[History of Ukraine|Ukraine]]. Kobzari, a plural of Kobzar, accompanied their singing with a [[kobza]], [[bandura]] or [[lira]]. After the abolition of the Hetmanate by Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]] the apellation "kobzar" was applied to all itinerant blind singers. Their repertoire included epic poems known as [[Duma (epic)|dumas]]. The stereotypical kobzar of the 19th century was usually blind. In Ukraine, kobzars were organized in Guilds, known as [[Kobzars'kyj Tsekh]] and had to undergo a rigorous apprenticeship (usually 3 years in length) before undergoing the first set of open examinations before becoming a kobzar. These guilds were similar to Orthodox Church brotherhoods in which each guild was associated with a specific church.  These guilds then would take care of one church icon or purchase new religious ornaments for their affiliated church (Kononeko, p. 568-569).  The members of these guilds thought of themselves as orally spreading knowledge about Orthodoxy by reciting the dumy that they knew (Kononeko, p. 570).

The institution of the kobzardom essentially ended in the [[Ukrainian SSR]] in the mid 1930's, when authentic kobzar performance was replaced with stylized performances of folk and classical music utilising the [[bandura]].

In recent times there has been an interest in reviving of authentic kobzar traditions which is marked by the re-establishing the [[Kobzarskyi Tsekh|Kobzar Guild]] as a school of historical Ukrainian performance practice.

At the turn of the 19th century there were three regional kobzar schools: [[Chernihiv kobzars|Chernihiv]], [[Poltava kobzars|Poltava]], and [[Slobozhan kobzars|Slobozhan]], each with some differences in repertoire and playing style.

'''''Kobzar''''' is also a seminal book of poetry by [[Taras Shevchenko]], the great national poet of [[Ukraine]].

==Discussion==
One of the problems in the contemporary study of the bandura and its art is the definition of what is and what is not a kobzar. What are the parameters for being a kobzar? When does one stop being a kobzar? Can a woman be a kobzar?

Some people have the notion that anyone that holds a bandura in his hands is a kobzar. Others feel that the term can only be used for a male, and excludes females. Still others feel that it is all dependent on repertoire. When one becomes even more specific, some categorize kobzars as the singers of dumy, historic songs and psalms. Still others state that true kobzars were blind.

In recent times the term kobzar is being more specific, being used for the vocation of a blind itinerant musician who played the [[bandura]] or [[kobza]] and led a specific lifestyle. With the great social upheavals of the 20th century, this lifestyle and vocation ceased to exist. With it disappeared much of the kobzar legacy. This cessation has been strongly missed by sections of the Ukrainian society and attempts were made to document and revive it. Thus we have bandurists who are not kobzars in the traditional sense, who perform music which may, or may not have been greatly influenced by the kobzars. These performers are however not true kobzars.

There are even instances of blind musicians who play the contemporary bandura - conservatory trained who remind us in may ways of the traditional kobzar, - however these are not true kobzars - these are more accurately categorized as [[Blind bandurists]].

The problem then stands as to how to categorize these many related groups of performers. 

It may be better to confine the definition of kobzar to just those musicians who lead a specific lifestyle, performed in a traditional manner and a specific repertoire. '''Soviet pseudo-kobzars''' (usually blind musicians whose lifestyle, repertoire and bandura technique differs considerably from that of their predecessors), '''authentic performers''' (contemporary bandurists performing in a manner as similar to the authentic kobzars as possible), '''kobzar-bandurists''' (non-blind performers on contemporary instruments with metal pegs and chromatic strings using contemporary bandura techniques) and '''bandurists''' (conservatory trained instrumentalists who usually play non-traditional repertoire).
