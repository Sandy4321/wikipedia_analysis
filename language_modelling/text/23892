[[Image:B-d.png|thumb|A Diagram of the Station]]'''Bloor-Yonge''' is a [[List of Toronto TTC stations|station]] on the [[Yonge-University-Spadina (TTC)|Yonge-University-Spadina line]] and the [[Bloor-Danforth (TTC)|Bloor-Danforth Line]] of the [[Toronto]], [[Canada]] [[Toronto Subway and RT|subway]].  It is located at 733 [[Yonge Street]] at [[Bloor Street]] West/East. It opened in [[1954]]. Nearby landmarks include the [[Toronto Reference Library]], the [[Hudson Bay Company]]'s [[The Bay]] Uptown [[department store]], and the northern end of the Yonge Street Strip.

The only daytime bus route that serves Bloor-Yonge is the 97B Yonge. At night, this is a key transfer between the '''300 Bloor-Danforth''' and '''320 Yonge''' ''Blue Night'' Buses.

The station was originally simply named 'Bloor', and connected with a pair of enclosed platforms in the centre of Bloor Street to allow interchange with Bloor [[Toronto streetcar system|streetcar]]s within the fare-paid zone. When the streetcars were replaced with the Bloor-Danforth subway in [[1966]], the station was renamed 'Bloor-Yonge', but actual platform signs still show 'Bloor' on the Yonge-University-Spadina line and 'Yonge' on the Bloor-Danforth Line, following the style common in the [[New York City Subway]]. It is the only TTC station named in this way; all other interchanges share the same name for both lines.

Bloor is the busiest station in the system, serving nearly 400,000 people a day in both platforms, and in [[1992]] the TTC took advantage of building construction over the station to open it out and widen the platforms. This was actually the first stage of a plan to eventually enable trains to open their doors on both sides: the tracks would next have been slewed outwards within the widened station, and a central platform built between them. The TTC does not currently intend to proceed with this, as it would require closing the station for many months.

After leaving the station northbound on the Yonge-University Spadina line and crossing under Church Street in a tunnel, the line returns to the surface, mostly in an open cut, for some 800 metres going through [[Rosedale (TTC)|Rosedale station]].

Immediately west of the station on the Bloor-Danforth Line, the second pair of connecting tracks from the University section of the Yonge-University Spadina line join onto the running lines from the inside.  Within the station, the Yonge section of the Yonge-University-Spadina line crosses above the Bloor-Danforth line.

East of the station, the Bloor-Danforth line goes into bored tunnel to cross to the south side of Bloor Street, and arrives at [[Sherbourne (TTC)|Sherbourne station]].
