'''Radcliffe''' is a town within the [[Metropolitan Borough of Bury]], in [[Greater Manchester]], England.<ref name="GM Gazetteer">{{citation |url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/guides/gazette/gazframe.htm |title=A select gazetteer of local government areas, Greater Manchester County|publisher=[[Greater Manchester County Record Office]]|accessdate=2008-10-17|date=2003-07-31}}</ref> It lies on undulating ground in the [[Irwell Valley]], along the course of the [[River Irwell]], {{convert|2.5|mi|km|1}} south-west of [[Bury]] and {{convert|6.5|mi|km|1}} north-northwest of [[Manchester]]. Radcliffe is contiguous with the town of [[Whitefield, Greater Manchester|Whitefield]] to the south.  The disused [[Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal]] bisects the town.

Historically a part of [[Lancashire]], evidence of [[Mesolithic]], [[Roman Britain|Roman]] and [[Normans|Norman]] activity has been found in Radcliffe and its surroundings. A Roman road passes through the area, along the border between Radcliffe and Bury. Radcliffe appears in an entry of the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' as "Radeclive". During the [[High Middle Ages]] Radcliffe formed a small parish (one of the smallest in England) and the township centred on the [[Parish Church of St Mary, Radcliffe|Church of St Mary]] and the manorial [[Radcliffe Tower]], both of which are local landmarks and [[Grade I listed buildings in Greater Manchester|Grade I listed buildings]]. Two [[hamlet]]s lay within the parish boundaries: Radcliffe, around the church; and Radcliffe Bridge, which lay by a bridge over the River Irwell and later developed into Radcliffe's commercial centre.

[[Coal measure]]s underlie the area, and a series of mines opened during the [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed Radcliffe into an important industrial area. Locally sourced coal provided the fuel for a variety of cotton spinning and papermaking industries. The adoption of the [[factory system]] facilitated a process of unplanned urbanisation in the area, and by the mid-19th century Radcliffe had emerged as an important [[mill town]] at a convergence of [[cotton mill]]s, [[bleach]]works, and a newly constructed road, canal and railway network.<ref name="McNeil">{{Harvnb|McNeil|Nevell|2000|pp=24&ndash;25}}.</ref>  The town no longer has any working collieries, and imports of cheaper foreign goods led to the decline of Radcliffe's heavy industries during the mid-20th century.

Radcliffe is a predominantly residential area of mixed affluence, with a population of&nbsp;34,239. The legacy of its industrial past can be seen in the few remaining cotton mills which now are occupied by small businesses. Economically, the town's industrial diversity has allowed it to weather the decline of its heavy industries.<ref name="McNeil"/>  A study commissioned by Bury [[Metropolitan Borough]] Council in 2003 recommended improvements for the town, including new housing, jobs, and a new school.<ref name="Re-inventingRadcliffeReport"/>

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name Radcliffe is derived from the [[Old English]] words ''read'' and ''clif'',<ref name="LAP">{{Citation | title = Radcliffe Local Area Partnership | url = http://www.bury.gov.uk/LocalAreaPartnerships/Radcliffe/default.htm | publisher = Bury Metropolitan Borough Council | accessdate = 2008-10-26 }}</ref> meaning "the red cliff or bank",<ref>{{Harvnb|Mills|1998|p=292.}}</ref> on the River Irwell in the Irwell Valley.  The ''[[Domesday Book]]'' records the name as "Radeclive".<ref name="Farrerpp5667"/><ref name="LAP"/>  Other archaic spellings include "Radclive" (recorded in 1227), and "Radeclif" (recorded in 1309 and 1360).<ref name="Farrerpp5667"/>  The [[Radcliffe Baronets|Radcliffe family]] took its name from the town.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sunderland|1995|p=15.}}</ref>

===Early history===
The first human settlements in the area, albeit seasonal, are thought to have been as far back as 6,000BC during the [[Mesolithic]] period.  Archaeological excavations in 1949 at Radcliffe E'es (a level plain along the north bank of the Irwell, formed by retreating [[glacier|glacial]] deposits during the previous [[ice age]])<ref name="Sunderlandp10">{{Harvnb|Sunderland|1995|p=10.}}</ref> found evidence of pre-historic activity, suggesting a lake village site, but dating techniques of the time were unreliable.  Further investigations in 1961 revealed rows of sharpened posts and worked timbers, but no further dating evidence was collected.  In 1911 while repairs to the bridge at Radcliffe bridge were underway, a stone axe-hammer was found in the river bed.  The {{convert|8.5|in|cm|sing=on}} artefact weighs {{convert|4|lb|kg}} and is made from polished [[Quartzite]], with a bore to take a shaft.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sunderland|1995|pp=10<U+2013>11.}}</ref><ref>Although the Sunderland book mentions that this axe is kept at Bury Museum the Museum has been unable to verify this, but it does possess three axe-hammers of indeterminate origin</ref>  

South of the present-day Withins reservoir is a possible location for a [[Henge|Hengi-form]] [[Tumulus]].<ref>{{Citation | title = Bury Archaeological Project | url = http://www.bury.gov.uk/Environment/Planning/PlanningProjects/PastProjects/BAP.htm | publisher = Bury Metropolitan Borough Council | accessdate = 2009-02-09 }}</ref>  The town also has Roman associations; a [[Roman road]] passes through the town, along the border between Radcliffe and Bury on a south-east to north-west route.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1852|p=98.}}</ref>  It allowed easy travel between the [[castra|Roman forts]] at Manchester ([[Mamucium]]) and [[Ribchester]] ([[Bremetennacum]]).<ref>{{Citation | title = Roman Roads in Lancashire | url=http://www.lancscc.gov.uk/environment/historichighways/roman2.asp |publisher = Lancashire County Council | accessdate = 2008-10-26 }}</ref>  The approximate route was through Higher Lane in nearby Whitefield, through Dales Lane and across the Irwell over Radcliffe E'es through the site of the former East Lancashire Paper Mill.  The route passes up Croft Lane, over Cross Lane and over the route of the [[Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal]] under the 10&nbsp;3/4&nbsp;milestone.  It then crosses Bury and Bolton Road, and heads through Higher Spen Moor.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sunderland|1995|p=11.}}</ref>

Other than placenames, little information about the area survives from the [[Dark Ages]].  Radcliffe was likely comprised of [[moorland]] and [[swamps]].<ref name="Sunderlandp15">{{Harvnb|Sunderland|1995|p=15.}}</ref>

Following the 11th century [[Norman conquest of England]], Radcliffe became a parish and [[Township (England)|township]] in the [[Salford (hundred)|hundred of Salford]], and [[Historic counties of England|county]] of [[Lancashire]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Farrer|Brownbill|1911a|pp=171&ndash;173.}}</ref>  One of only four parishes from the hundred mentioned in the ''Domesday Book'' and held by [[Edward the Confessor]] as a [[Royal Manor]],<ref name="Sunderlandp15"/> it initially consisted of two [[hamlet]]s; Radcliffe, near to the border with Bury and centred on the [[Medieval]] [[Parish Church of St Mary, Radcliffe|Church of St Mary]] and the manorial [[Radcliffe Tower]], and further to the west Radcliffe Bridge, at a crossing of the Irwell.<ref name="Farrerpp5667"/>  As a Royal Manor, the [[Hide (unit)|hide]] may originally have been up to four times the size it was when it was recorded in 1212 as being held by William de Radeclive, of the "Radclyffes of the Tower" family.<ref name="Sunderlandp15"/>

In the 15th century the Pilkington family who, during the [[Wars of the Roses]], supported the [[House of York]], owned much of the land around the parish.  Thomas Pilkington was at this time [[Lord of the Manor|lord]] of many estates in Lancashire.<ref name="FarrerBrownbillpp8892">{{Harvnb|Farrer|Brownbill|1911b|pp=88&ndash;92.}}</ref><ref name="Cowardpp1314">{{Harvnb|Coward|1983|pp=13&ndash;14.}}</ref>  In 1485 [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] was killed in the [[Battle of Bosworth]].  The [[Duke of Richmond]], representing the [[House of Lancaster]], was crowned [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]].  [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|Sir William Stanley]] may have placed the crown upon his head.  As a reward for the support of his family, on 27 October 1485 Henry made [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Thomas Stanley]] the [[Earl of Derby]].  Thomas Pilkington was [[Attainder|attainted]], and in February 1489 Earl Thomas was given many confiscated estates including those of Pilkington, which included the township of [[Pilkington (ancient township)|Pilkington]], and [[Bury]].<ref name="Cowardpp1314"/>  During the [[English Civil War]] Radcliffe, along with nearby [[Bolton]], fought on the side of the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] against the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] Bury.<ref name="renaissanceradcliffept1">{{Citation | title = The Renaissance of Radcliffe - Part 1 | url = http://www.bury.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/7CCC918F-6D0C-420F-A4C6-79E68FD2B3B8/0/Section3TherenaissanceofRadcliffePart1.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = Bury Metropolitan Borough Council | accessdate = 2008-11-04 }}</ref>

In 1561 after about 400&nbsp;years rule by the Radclyffes, Robert Assheton (Lord of the Manor of [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]]) bought the manor of Radcliffe for 2,000&nbsp;[[Mark (money)|Marks]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Sunderland|1995|p=17.}}</ref><ref name="Farrerpp5667">{{Harvnb|Farrer|Brownbill|1911c|pp=56&ndash;67.}}</ref>  From 1765 the Assheton estates were divided between the two daughters of the late Ralph Assheton, one of whom married [[Thomas Egerton, 1st Earl of Wilton]].  The manor of Radcliffe appears to have been included in her share, and thereafter was included in the Wilton estates.<ref name="Farrerpp5667"/>

[[Image:Radcliffe looking east 1902 .jpg|thumb|During the [[Industrial Revolution]] the [[River Irwell]] was badly polluted by industry, such as that pictured in this photograph of Radcliffe taken in 1902.]]
The first documented reference to industry in Radcliffe was after 1680, in the Radcliffe [[parish register]]s, which make increasing mention of occupations such as woollen webster ([[weaving]]), linen webster, and whitster (bleacher).  These were [[Putting-out system#Cottage industry|cottage industries]] which worked alongside local agriculture.  In 1780 [[Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet|Robert Peel]] built the first factory in the town, several hundred yards upstream from Radcliffe Bridge (at the end of Peel Street).  With a [[weir]] and [[goit]] providing motive power for a [[water wheel]], the factory was built for throstle spinning and the weaving of cotton&mdash;a relatively new introduction to Britain. The water wheel proved to be insufficient, and so around 1804 the goit was extended.  The weir (known as Rectory Weir)<ref name="Ordnancesurvey">{{Citation | publisher = Ordnance Survey |title = Radcliffe, Lancashire & Furness & Stoneclough, Lancashire & Furness | url = http://www.old-maps.co.uk | year = 1848 | accessdate = 2009-01-03}}</ref> was made from timber.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1900|p=164.}}</ref>  Conditions were poor; the mill employed [[child labour]] bought from [[workhouse]]s in [[Birmingham]] and London  Children were boarded on an upper floor of the building, and bound until they reached the age of 21.  They were unpaid, and were kept locked up each night.  Shifts were typically 10&ndash;10.5&nbsp;hours in length, and children returning from a day shift would sleep in the same bed as children leaving for a night shift.  Peel himself admitted that conditions at the mill were "very bad".<ref>{{Harvnb|Augusta|1969|p=5.}}</ref>  In 1784 an outbreak of [[typhoid]] prompted [[Thomas Egerton, 1st Earl of Wilton|Lord Grey de Wilton]] to inform the magistrates of the [[Salford (hundred)|Salford Hundred]];<ref>{{Harvnb|Landau|2002|p=238.}}</ref> keen to prevent the spread of the disease to neighbouring towns and villages, they sent doctors to assess the situation.  Their recommendations included leaving the windows of the mill open at night, [[fumigation]] of rooms with [[tobacco]] (as this was thought to discourage disease), regular cleaning of rooms and toilets, and occasional bathing of children.<ref>{{Citation | title = Outbreak of Fever in Cotton Mills at Radcliffe, 1784 | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1037863 | last = Meiklejohn | first = A. | publisher = British Journal of Industrial Medicine | date = 1959-01-16 | accessdate = 2008-11-16 }}</ref>  The report forced the magistrates, led by Thomas Butterworth Bayley, to abandon the practice of binding parish apprentices to any mill not adhering to these conditions.  The report also prompted Peel to introduce an [[Act of Parliament]] to improve factory hygiene, which later became the [[Factory_Act#Factory_Act_1802|Factory Act of 1802]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Sunderland|1995|p=65.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Russell|2001|p=86.}}</ref>  Over time, conditions at the mill improved; in the mid-1790s the physician [[John Aikin]], a critic of the factory system, praised working conditions at the mill,<ref>{{Harvnb|Landau|2002|p=248.}}</ref> and in 1823 inspections by local magistrates of conditions in mills across the county revealed that unlike many others, the factory at Radcliffe was adhering to all requirements of the [[Factory Acts]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Augusta|1969|p=73.}}</ref>

The underlying coal measures throughout the parish were a valuable source of fuel.  Radcliffe already had an established textile industry before the arrival of [[Steam power during the Industrial Revolution|steam power]].  The first recorded instance of coal getting in the [[North West of England]] was in 1246, when Adam de Radeclyve was fined for digging ''de minera'' on [[common land]] in the Radcliffe area.  Coal outcroppings were not uncommon; as recently as 1936 members of the public were seen carrying away large pieces of coal from a seam revealed by the landslip caused when the [[Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal]] breached at Ladyshore.  Mining was initially limited to [[bell pit]]s until the arrival of steam engines, which along with improved ventilation, made possible much deeper pits.  The earliest known local use of such an engine was in 1792 at Black Cat Colliery.  The parish of Radcliffe was once home to as many as 50&nbsp;pits, but with the exceptions of [[Outwood Colliery]] and [[Ladyshore Colliery]], all were either exhausted or closed by the end of the 19th century.  During the [[1926 General Strike]] many striking miners illegally took coal from exposed seams around the Coney Green area of the town, to sell to local housewives.  In the 1950s to the north of the town the [[National Coal Board]] did some [[open cast mining]] near Radcliffe Moor Road, but the last legal instance of coal mining in Radcliffe was between 1931 and 1949, close to Bury and Bolton Road.<ref name="Sunderlandpp8385">{{Harvnb|Sunderland|1995|pp=83&ndash;85.}}</ref>  

The transformation of the area from an industry based upon water power, to one based upon steam power, may not have been without problems. A story in W. Nicholl's ''History and Traditions of Radcliffe'' (1900) told of a "great crowd" of protesters from Bury who marched on Bealey's Works, and demanded that work be halted. James Booth ordered the gates closed, gave the ringleaders <U+00A3>5, and promised to halt work the next day. The crowd then marched on other businesses within the town before heading along the canal to Bolton, at which point they were apparently turned back by news of approaching soldiers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1900|pp=167&ndash;168.}}</ref>

[[Image:Mount sion beam pump radcliffe.jpg|left|thumb|The [[beam engine]] used to pump water for Mount Sion Mill]]
There were many smaller textile concerns in the parish.  Thomas Howarth owned a cottage in Stand Lane from where he sent yarn to be dyed and sized.  He made his own [[Warp (weaving)|warps]] which were weaved in the town.  He would then travel to [[Preston]] and [[Kendal]] where [[draper]]s would purchase his products.  His nephews founded A. & J. Hoyle's Mill in Irwell Street, which employed power weaving to produce their specialities in [[Gingham]]s and [[shirt]]ing. The mill closed in 1968.  Messrs Stott & Pickstone's Top Shop on Stand Lane was the first company to employ powered looms and spinning around 1844.  Many of their employees would eventually leave to start their own businesses, such as Spider Mill, built by Robert and William Fletcher, and John Pickstone. This mill closed around 1930.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sunderland|1995|pp=65&ndash;66.}}</ref>

Radcliffe was at one time home to around 60 textile mills and 15 spinning mills, along with 18 bleachworks of which the Bealey family were prominent owners.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sunderland|1995|p=67.}}</ref>  However, the textile industry was not the town's major employer; other industries such as mining and paper making were also important sources of employment.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sunderland|1995|p=68.}}</ref>

Mount Sion Mill along Sion Street was founded in the early 1800s and during the First World War manufactured [[Nitrocellulose|guncotton]]. A weir was constructed along with a goit, used to turn a water wheel which powered a [[beam engine]] to pump water to the reservoirs above.<ref>This engine was mentioned in Sunderland's ''Book of Radcliffe'' (1995) as existing at the time of publication.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Sunderland|1995|p=73.}}</ref>  

Radcliffe became well known for its paper industry; its mills included the East Lancashire Paper Mill and Radcliffe Paper Mill. The former was founded by the Seddon family on 29&nbsp;March 1860, along the banks of the Irwell.  Its construction provided much-needed employment: in the 1860s living standards within the town were poor, and local mills often operated on "short time".  A reduction in the demand for coal had placed many colliers out of work, and the [[Lancashire Cotton Famine]] was starving [[Lancashire]] of raw materials, especially cotton. [[Soup kitchen]]s were opened by local benefactors, and many local residents were on [[poor relief]].<ref name="Goodersonp8"/>  The mill began producing low grade paper and newsprint, moving on to other products including high quality printing and writing papers.  Radcliffe Paper Mill was formed during the First World War, when it took over from a paper mill and a pipe plant.  It originally produced paper suitable for roofing felt, to cater for a national shortage.  After World War II the mill employed over 600&nbsp;people and produced 70,000&nbsp;tons of paper annually.  British Plaster Board Industries (BPB) took over the company in 1961.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sunderland|1995|p=74.}}</ref>

Other industries in the town included [[Brickworks#Brick_making|brick making]] and chimney pot manufacture.  Raw materials were sourced from local collieries.  In Mill Street carts, waggons, and bicycles were manufactured from 1855, and elsewhere motor vehicles were also produced until the late 1950s.  [[John Cockerill]] moved to the town from [[Haslingden]] before leaving for continental Europe to become the founder of [[Cockerill-Sambre]].  His son, James Cockerill, employed Radcliffe man William Yates as his manager.  Several [[Foundry|foundries]] and machine manufacturers were located around the town, including Dobson and Barlow at Bradley Fold, and Wolstenholme's along Bridgewater Street.  Munitions, aircraft, and tank components were manufactured during the Second World War.  Chemicals were manufactured by companies such as Bealey's and J. & W. Whewell.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sunderland|1995|pp=78&ndash;79.}}</ref>

===Post-industrial history===
From the 1950s Radcliffe's textile industry went into terminal decline, and although its paper industry survived to the end of the 20th century, both the town's largest paper mills have now been closed and demolished.<ref name="renaissanceradcliffept1"/>  One of the larger mills in Radcliffe was the Pioneer Mill, built between 1905 and 1906, and which ceased weaving in July 1980<U+2014>the last mill in Radcliffe to use cotton.<ref name="Sunderlandp66">{{Harvnb|Sunderland|1995|p=66.}}</ref>  The building is now occupied by several different businesses. 

Although the town retains much of its existing Victorian and Edwardian housing stock, new estates have been built on former [[Brownfield land]] including that of the Radcliffe Paper Mill Company.<ref name="renaissanceradcliffept1"/>  Since [[deindustrialisation]] the local population has continued to grow.<ref>see Population and employment change</ref>  Radcliffe's housing stock of 23,790&nbsp;properties is a mixture of mainly [[semi-detached]] and [[terrace (building)|terrace]]d housing, with smaller percentages of [[detached]] housing and flats.<ref>{{Citation |title=Household Spaces and Accommodation Type (KS16), Radcliffe Central Ward|publisher=Statistics.gov.uk |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=5941668&c=radcliffe&d=14&e=7&g=350504&i=1001x1003x1004&o=1&m=0&r=1&s=1232388751686&enc=1&dsFamilyId=49 |date=2004-11-09 | accessdate = 2009-01-19}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=Household Spaces and Accommodation Type (KS16), Radcliffe East Ward |publisher=Statistics.gov.uk |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=6101262&c=radcliffe&d=14&e=7&g=350509&i=1001x1003x1004&o=1&m=0&r=1&s=1232388922214&enc=1&dsFamilyId=49 |date=2004-11-09 | accessdate = 2009-01-19}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=Household Spaces and Accommodation Type (KS16), Radcliffe North Ward |publisher=Statistics.gov.uk |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=6101263&c=radcliffe&d=14&e=7&g=350517&i=1001x1003x1004&o=1&m=0&r=1&s=1232388937370&enc=1&dsFamilyId=49 |date=2004-11-09 | accessdate = 2009-01-19}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=Household Spaces and Accommodation Type (KS16), Radcliffe South Ward |publisher=Statistics.gov.uk |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=5941666&c=radcliffe&d=14&e=7&g=350587&i=1001x1003x1004&o=1&m=0&r=1&s=1232388947479&enc=1&dsFamilyId=49 |date=2004-11-09 | accessdate = 2009-01-19}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=Household Spaces and Accommodation Type (KS16), Radcliffe West Ward |publisher=Statistics.gov.uk |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=6101264&c=radcliffe&d=14&e=7&g=350504&i=1001x1003x1004&o=1&m=0&r=1&s=1232388955291&enc=1&dsFamilyId=49 |date=2004-11-09 | accessdate = 2009-01-19}}</ref>  In 1974 the town became a part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Bury]], and as a result has been described as losing its independence, and to some extent its identity.<ref name="renaissanceradcliffept1"/>

Radcliffe became a part of the [[Municipal Borough]] of Bury in 1876, but following the [[Local Government Act 1894]] it left the district (by then the [[County Borough of Bury]]), becoming an [[urban district]] within the [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of Lancashire.<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Youngs|1991|pp=195, 679, 680, 689.}}</ref>  The district boundary was extended to include the Stand Lane district<ref>This district was formerly within the [[Whitefield, Greater Manchester|Whitefield]] Local Board district.</ref>  The extension made the area covered by Radcliffe [[Urban District]] {{convert|3084|acre|km2 sqmi}}.<ref name="BoroRadcliffep10"/>  Radcliffe Urban District was governed by a council of 24&nbsp;members, made from six [[councillor]]s from each of the four [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]], Radcliffe Hall, Radcliffe Bridge, Black Lane, and Stand Lane.<ref name="Farrerpp5667"/>  Alker Allen J.P. was the first chairman of the new council.<ref name="BoroRadcliffep10"/>  A [[town hall]] was built in 1911, replacing an earlier building on the junction of Water Street and Spring Lane.  It formed the public administrative centre for the district with a large council chamber on the first floor, with public gallery, and four committee rooms.<ref name="boroughradcliffep26"/>

The Lancashire (Southern Areas) Review Order of 1933 extended the district to include the township of [[Ainsworth, Greater Manchester|Ainsworth]], and a portion of the township of [[Outwood, Greater Manchester|Outwood]]. This increased the area covered by Radcliffe District to {{convert|4915|acre|km2}}.  A new ward was created for Ainsworth, comprising the former township and a portion of the Black Lane ward.

The larger towns of [[Bury]] and [[Bolton]] lie to the northeast and northwest.  For the purposes of the [[Office for National Statistics]], Radcliffe forms a northerly part of the [[Greater Manchester Urban Area]],<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/census2001/ks_urban_north_part_5.pdf|format=PDF| title=Census 2001:Key Statistics for urban areas in the North; Map 3|author=[[Office for National Statistics]]|publisher=statistics.gov.uk|accessdate=2008-10-14|year=2001}}</ref> with [[Manchester city centre]] {{convert|6.5|mi|km|1}} to the south-southeast.<ref>{{Citation | title= Landranger 109: Manchester & surrounding area | publisher= [[Ordnance Survey]] | scale= 1:50,000 | year= 1983 | edition=5th | isbn=0319221091}}</ref>

Radcliffe's position on the River Irwell has proved important in its history and development as the river provided a source of water for local industry.  Radcliffe E'es, a level plain formed along the north bank of the Irwell during the previous [[ice age]],<ref name="Sunderlandp10"/> is now derelict and the planned location of a new school.<ref>{{Citation | title = East Lancashire Paper Mill | url = http://www.bury.gov.uk/Environment/Planning/DevelopmentPlanning/LocalDevelopmentFramework/SupplementaryPlanningGuidance/MasterplansDevelopment/elpm.htm | publisher = Bury Metropolitan Borough Council | accessdate = 2008-10-30}}</ref>  From a highpoint of {{convert|500|ft|m|0}} above sea level in the northwest of Radcliffe, the surface gradually descends, particularly in the south and east, being the lowest along the River Irwell.  The geology is represented by [[coal measure]].<ref name="Farrerpp5667"/>

Radcliffe is surrounded by open space and rural land, much of which is visible from the town centre.<ref name="renaissanceradcliffept1"/>  To the east of the town the [[River Roch]] flows under Blackford Bridge, and joins the Irwell shortly thereafter, along which several [[weir]]s and [[Leat|goits]] were built as it passes through the town.  Flowing from east to west the river divides the town on the north and south sides of the valley respectively.  The [[town centre]] sits on the north side of the valley . Two road bridges cross the river: one in the former hamlet of Radcliffe Bridge, and another newer bridge built as part of the [[A665 road|A665 Pilkington Bypass]].  Another bridge crosses the river along the eastern border with Bury.  Various smaller pedestrian footbridges and two railway [[viaduct]]s (one disused) also exist.<ref name="OSradcliffe">{{Citation | title = OS Landranger Map sheet 109 | url = http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/ | publisher = Ordnance Survey | accessdate = 2008-12-31 }}</ref>

The residential areas of Radcliffe both to the north and the south of the town centre operate as suburbs of Bury and Manchester, such that their populations are not necessarily linked to the town.  The socio-demographic characteristics of the town's population includes a mix of working and suburban middle classes, the layout of which are both linked to neighbouring towns.<ref name="renaissanceradcliffept1"/>

==Economy==
Radcliffe's first market was built by the [[Thomas Egerton, 2nd Earl of Wilton|Earl of Wilton]] and opened in 1851.<ref name="Farrerpp5667"/>  The town was home to twelve [[Co-op]] stores,<ref name="Hudsonp39">{{Harvnb|Hudson|2001|p=39.}}</ref> the largest of which was on Stand Lane.

The construction in the 1980s of the A665 Pilkington Way [[bypass (road)|Bypass]] relieved traffic congestion along the traditional route through the town, Blackburn Street. A new bridge across the Irwell was constructed for the road, and part of Blackburn Street was [[Car-free zone|pedestrianised]].  The road has attracted developments along former industrial land to the west of the town, including a large [[Asda]] supermarket, although it has exacerbated the decline of the retail outlets in the town centre.

"Re-inventing Radcliffe" is the name given on a report of a proposed improvement scheme.  The report envisages several initiatives, and includes the creation of new housing both to the north and south of the town.  Existing industry to the west of the town and along Milltown Street would be retained and improved, along with sections of the former Radcliffe Paper Mill and Pioneer Mill.  The market would be redeveloped along with the [[Kwik Save]] site and bus station, and the town could become a centre for the arts.  To improve transport links, new crossings of the Irwell and canal are proposed, along with a new school to replace the two existing [[secondary school]]s.  Finally, the report suggests improving the image of Radcliffe within the Bury area.<ref name="Re-inventingRadcliffeReport"/>

==Transport==
The Manchester to Blackburn [[packhorse]] route passed through the town (hence the name Blackburn Street).  The bridge across the Irwell was likely first erected during the late Medieval period at the site of a ford.  An [[Act of Parliament]] in 1754 authorised the first turnpike through the hamlet of Radcliffe Bridge,<ref name="Wellspp102103">{{Harvnb|Wells|1995|pp=102&ndash;103.}}</ref> and included Manchester to Bury via [[Crumpsall]], and from [[Prestwich]] to Radcliffe.  An Act of 1821 created a turnpike from Bury to Radcliffe, [[Stoneclough]] and [[Bolton]].  An Act of 1836 created a turnpike from Starling Lane to [[Ainsworth, Greater Manchester|Ainsworth]], and Radcliffe to Bury and Manchester Road (near Fletcher Fold).  A turnpike from Whitefield to Radcliffe Bridge via Stand Lane was created in 1857 with [[toll house]]s at [[Besses o' th' Barn]], Stand Lane, the junction of Dumers Lane and Manchester Road, on Bolton Road near Countess Lane, and on Radcliffe Moor Road at Bradley Fold.  Radcliffe New Road was created in an Act of 1860 which enabled the construction of a toll road between Radcliffe and Whitefield.<ref name="Sunderlandp53">{{Harvnb|Sunderland|1995|p=53.}}</ref>  To prevent damage to the road surfaces, weighing machines were used at various strategic positions including at the bridge end of Dumers Lane, at Sandiford turning, and on Ainsworth Road.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1900|pp=108, 111.}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | title = Records of Prestwich, Bury and Radcliffe Turnpike Trust | url = http://archives.bury.gov.uk/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqCmd=NaviTreeX.tcl&dsqField=RefNo&dsqItem=APT#HERE | publisher = Bury Archives Catalogue | location = Bury Archives Service, Moss Street, Bury | accessdate = 2008-10-28}}</ref>

[[Image:1911 radcliffe manchester.png|left|thumb|This 1911 map demonstrates the significant railway infrastructure through the town]]
During the [[Industrial Revolution]], as local [[Cottage_industry#Cottage_industry|cottage industries]] were gradually supplanted by the [[factory system]] the roads became inadequate for use.  A convoy of horse-drawn lorries carrying salt between Bealey's Bleach Works and [[Northwich]] would take up to two weeks to make a return journey.<ref name="Sunderlandp53"/>  These problems gave rise to the construction of the [[Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal]], which reached the town in 1796 and which was navigable throughout in 1808.  For 38&nbsp;years the canal was the town's main route for trade and transport, with a [[wharf]] near Hampson Street.  The proprietors later converted into a railway company and built a line between [[Salford]] and [[Bolton]], which opened in 1838.  A branch from this line was to have been built to [[Bury]], along the line of the canal, but due to technical constraints this did not happen.<ref name="Wellsp3">{{Harvnb|Wells|1995|p=3.}}</ref>  Radcliffe's closest railway connection therefore several miles distant at [[Kearsley railway station|Stoneclough]].<ref name="Ordnancesurvey"/>

The opening of the [[Manchester, Bury and Rossendale Railway]] (later known as the [[East Lancashire Railway 1844<U+2013>1859|East Lancashire Railway]] (ELR)) in 1846<ref>{{Harvnb|Wells|1995|p=4.}}</ref> brought the town a direct connection to Manchester and [[Bury Bolton Street railway station|Bury]].  Two stations served the town, [[Radcliffe Bridge railway station|Radcliffe Bridge station]], and [[Withins Lane railway station|Withins Lane station]] (although this closed in 1851 after only a few years of operation).  [[Ringley Road railway station|Ringley Road station]] was located to the south of the parish, close to the civil parish of Pilkington.  The line crossed the Irwell over [[Outwood Viaduct]], an impressive structure which remains to this day.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wells|1995|pp=109&ndash;115.}}</ref>

The [[Liverpool and Bury Railway]] (L&BR) opened on 28 November 1848, with a station to the north of the town, called [[Black Lane railway station (Radcliffe)|Black Lane station]]. On 18 July 1872 the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] (L&YR), which had amalgamated with the ELR some years previously, gained an Act of Parliament to construct a railway between Manchester and Bury, via [[Whitefield, Greater Manchester|Whitefield]] and [[Prestwich]].  This opened in 1879 with a new station, known as [[Radcliffe Metrolink station|Radcliffe New Station]],<ref>From 1933 this station was renamed "Radcliffe Central"</ref> with a link to the L&BR line at Bradley Fold (near the present day Chatsworth Road), and a new station along Ainsworth Road, [[Ainsworth Road Halt railway station|Ainsworth Road Halt]]. The new L&YR route joined the existing ELR route near Withins Lane (North Junction), whereon they shared the connection to Bury.  The L&YR gained a further Act of 1877 to construct a link between North Junction and Coney Green Farm (West Junction). The LY&R line was electrified in 1916 for which a substation was constructed, between the canal and the West Fork.<ref name="Wellspp102103"/>

The town also had an extensive [[Tram#Electric_.28trolley_cars.29|tram]] network.  The first tram ran from Black Lane (latterly Ainsworth Road) in 1905, with a terminus next to St Andrew's Church on Black Lane Bridge.  In 1907 a branch was built to connect to the Bury to Bolton part of the network.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sunderland|1995|p=43.}}</ref>  A large bus station is located between Dale Street and the river.<ref name="GMPTEradcliffe">{{Citation | title = Radcliffe Bus Station | url = http://www.gmpte.com/destination/Radcliffe.pdf | publisher = GMPTE | date = 2008-06-09 | accessdate = 2009-01-01 | format = PDF}}</ref>  Officially abandoned in 1961, the canal is currently undergoing restoration on the [[Salford]] arm,<ref name=fullsteam>{{Citation | title = Full Steam Ahead For Canal Restoration In Salford | publisher = British Waterways | url = http://www.britishwaterways.co.uk/newsroom/all-press-releases/display/id/1738 | accessdate=2008-06-27}}</ref> although a rebuilt bridge along Water Street presents a barrier to its full restoration.<ref>{{Citation | title = History of the Waterway - Restoration | url = http://www.mbbcs.org.uk/history/restoration.htm | publisher = Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal Society | accessdate = 2008-12-12 }}</ref>

{{seealso|List of schools in Bury}}
[[Image:Radcliffe technical school 1896 greater manchester.jpg|thumb|upright|The former entrance to Radcliffe Technical School. The building is now used by the local council as office space.]]
One of the earliest schools in the parish was the Close Wesleyan Day School, a [[Dame school]] opened around 1840.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1900|p=30.}}</ref>  St Thomas's day school was opened on 4 March 1861, and housed over 500&nbsp;children.  Due to overcrowding and the risk of subsidence caused by local mining activity, the school was rebuilt on a new site along School Street, provided by the [[Thomas Egerton, 2nd Earl of Wilton|Earl of Wilton]].  It was opened in October 1877 by Lady Wilton.  On the opposite side of the town St John's school started life in 1860 as an institute along Irwell Street, and by 1864 contained 120&nbsp;children.  The buildings were enlarged in 1869.  In 1897 eight teachers and a monitor taught 358&nbsp;children.  In 1899 the school leaving age was twelve, and many of the senior class were "half-timers" who would spend half the day at school, and the other half at work.  This system was abolished in 1919.  Regular epidemics of [[scarlet fever]], [[chicken pox]], [[mumps]], and especially [[measles]], meant that in 1897 and 1903 the school was temporarily closed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gooderson|1985|pp=62&ndash;63.}}</ref>  St John's school and the nearby Church were demolished in the 1970s.<ref name="StThomasHistory"/>  Radcliffe also had a Technical school on Whittaker Street.

===Church of England===
Radcliffe was an ancient parish which in its early history had duties which combined both ecclesiastical and civil matters.  In 1821 Radcliffe St. Thomas [[ecclesiastical parish]] was created from the ancient parish, and it was re-founded in 1839.  In 1873 further parts of the ancient parish were taken to form Bury St. Peters ecclesiastical parish.  In 1878 parts of the ancient parish as well as part of Radcliffe St. Thomas were taken to form Radcliffe St. Andrew, Black Lane ecclesiastical parish.<ref name=youngsp195-196/>  The [[Parish Church of St Mary, Radcliffe|Parish Church of St Mary]] was built during the 14th century, and the tower added in the 15th century.  In 1966 it was designated a [[Grade I]] [[listed building]] by [[English Heritage]] under its former name of the Church of St Mary and St Bartholomew.<ref name="Stmarylisted"/>  In 1991 some local parishes were merged, and the church adopted its present name.<ref>{{Citation |title=Radcliffe Parish Church |publisher=Radcliffe Parish Church |url=http://www.radcliffeparishchurch.org.uk/index.htm |accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref>

[[Image:Stand Lane Radcliffe looking north 1902.jpg|thumb|The many chimneys visible in this 1902 image of the town give an indication as to the degree of industrialisation. The Church of St John is visible here.]]
Radcliffe is also served by the Parish of St Thomas and St John.  St Thomas' is visible on the horizon for many miles. The original church was built in 1819 by Countess Grosvenor<ref name="Goodersonp8">{{Harvnb|Gooderson|1985|p=8.}}</ref> and is visible above in the image of Radcliffe Bridge.

==Sports==
Radcliffe has a rich history of sport, including [[association football|football]], [[rugby league|rugby]], cricket and swimming, but entertainment in Radcliffe once included [[bear-baiting]], [[bull-baiting]], and [[Cockfight|cock-fighting]].  Cock fights were prevalent in the town and took place in local "hush-shops", generally viewed by invitation only.  Bull and bear baiting was held in the Radcliffe Bridge area of the parish.  In Nicholls' ''History and Traditions of Radcliffe'' (1900) the author describes the contents of the diary of a Lord Kenyon, who wrote "W.M. Robt. James, and Thomas Radcliffe, were fined for causing a Bayre to be bayted upon Saturday being the 18th of March 1587<U+2013>8, at the Bull-Ringe neere the conduite in Manchester."<ref name="Nicholls208">{{Harvnb|Nicholls|pp=207&ndash;208.}}</ref>  Trained dogs were used to attack a bull, which was donated by the Earl of Wilton.  Such entertainment would take place where the bridge now stands, along the banks of the river near the ford.  Such spectacles were eventually outlawed by Act of Parliament, and the last bull bait in the town was held on 26&nbsp;September 1838.  Horse racing replaced the sport the following year, with a course alongside the river.  During the first year of racing the main spectator stand collapsed, injuring many spectators.  In 1876 events were moved to a new course<ref name="Nicholls208"/> approximately one mile in circumference<ref>{{Harvnb|Langley|1854|p=248.}}</ref> at Radcliffe Moor, upon which site the town's cricket club now stands.<ref name="Nicholls208"/>

===History===
The [[Rivers Pollution Prevention Act 1876]] posed a problem for the local authorities; disposal of sewage was generally an expensive proposition, and efforts to resolve the practical problems involved were often unsatisfactory.  After initial experiments, in 1894 contracts were let for work.  Chairman of the Local Board Samuel Walker Esq cut the first sod on 23 April 1894, and the works were completed in the following year.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1900|pp=242&ndash;243.}}</ref>

The town was provided with electricity by a coal-fired power station along the south bank of the river, to the west of the town.  Authorised by the Radcliffe Electric Lighting Order of 1894, and inaugurated on 5 October 1904,<ref>{{Harvnb|Borough of Radcliffe|1935|p=19.}}</ref> [[Radcliffe Power Station]] was opened by the [[Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] on 9 October 1905.<ref name=Times>{{Citation | title = Lancashire Electric Light and Power | publisher = ''[[The Times]] newspaper'' | page=22 | date = 1922-02-19}}</ref>  It originally had two 1,500&nbsp;kW turbo sets made by [[British Thomson-Houston]], and was the first power station in the country to transmit electricity over bare electrical conductors.<ref>{{Harvnb|Frost|1993|p=}}</ref>

In 1921 the Radcliffe and Little Lever Joint Gas Board purchased the Radcliffe & Pilkington Gas Company.  Constituted in 1921 by an Act of Parliament, the board consisted of six members of the Radcliffe Council and one member of the Little Lever Council.  The area supplied included all the districts of Radcliffe and Little Lever, and also Prestwich, Whitefield, Unsworth, Outwood, and Ainsworth.

Radcliffe's wealth as a mill town gave rise to many outlets for the entertainment of its population.  These included cinemas and [[public house]]s.  Several cinemas were built in the town, including the Picturedrome in Water Street,<ref name="Hudsonp39"/> and an Odeon cinema, built in 1937 along Dale Street.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hudson|2001|pp=108&ndash;109.}}</ref>  Whittaker Street [[Public bathing|public baths]] were built in 1898 and demolished in 1971.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hudson|2001|p=46.}}</ref>  Radcliffe Pool now provides swimming facilities for the local population.
