'''Delorimier Stadium''' ({{IPA-fr|d<U+0259>l<U+0254><U+0281>imje}}; also known as ''Montreal Stadium'', ''Hector Racine Stadium'' and ''Delorimier Downs'') <ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Delorimier_Downs Baseball Reference: Delorimier Downs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> was a 20,000-seat [[sports stadium]] at 2101 Ontario Street East, at the corner of De Lorimier Avenue in the present-day [[Montreal]] borough of [[Ville-Marie, Montreal|Ville-Marie]]. The stadium was home to the [[Montreal Royals]] [[International League]] baseball team, top farm club of the Brooklyn Dodgers [[Major League Baseball]] team, from 1928 to 1960, and from 1946 to 1953, home to the [[Montreal Alouettes]] of the [[Canadian Football League]].

Delorimier Downs, as it was originally called, was built by former [[Major League Baseball]] manager, [[George Stallings]], Montreal lawyer and politician, [[Athanase David]], and Montreal businessman, [[Ernest Savard]]. Among the stadium's other local affluent financiers were close friends Lucien Beauregard, Romeo Gauvreau, Hector H. Racine, and [[Charles Trudeau (businessman)|Charles E. Trudeau]]. The stadium opened in May 1928 following a parade and a large inauguration ceremony. Royals' general manager [[Frank Shaughnessy]] had a lighting system installed in the stadium for the 1935 season.

The stadium saw the launching of the baseball career of [[Gene Mauch]], who later came back to manage the [[Montreal Expos]], plus future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] members [[Sparky Anderson]], [[Roberto Clemente]] and [[Jackie Robinson]], the man who, first debuting in professional baseball with the Montreal Royals in 1946, would go on to break baseball's color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Other Royals' players of note include player-turned-actor [[Chuck Connors]] and Hall of Fame members [[Duke Snider]], [[Don Drysdale]], [[Walter Alston]], [[Roy Campanella]] and [[Tommy Lasorda]].

The Montreal Alouettes were founded in 1946 and played there to capacity crowds until 1953 when the team moved to larger facilities. It is where [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]] quarterback [[Sam Etcheverry]] made his [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] debut.

In 1951, several British [[football (soccer)]] teams toured North America. [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] played an exhibition match at Delorimier Stadium on May 20th against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. In 1957 Celtic returned to Delorimier for a June 9th exhibition match against [[Tottenham Hotspur]]. Although six years apart, on both occasions the ticket price was 15<U+00A2>. <ref>[http://www.celticprogrammesonline.com/PROGRAMME%20COVERS/FREINDLIES/USAcelts/intheusa.htm Celtic Programmes Online - Tours of the USA and Canada<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Delorimier Stadium was also the site of a number of professional [[boxing]] and [[wrestling]] matches.

In June 1952, [[Walter O'Malley]], Brooklyn Dodgers chief shareholder (owner) and president, <ref>[http://www.walteromalley.com/hist_dtown_page6.php O'Malley Seidler Partners, LLC.

Only this time it was to dedicate a plaque to honor Hector Racine's memory. <ref name="walteromalley.com" /> Hector Racine died that same year in Miami, Florida after watching the Brooklyn Dodgers lose to the Boston Red Sox in an exhibition game. <ref>"Hector Racine, 69, Baseball Leader; President of Montreal Royals, who was also a director of the Dodgers, and numerous Montreal and Midtown Manhattan firms, dies." The New York Times. March 13, 1956. "Hector Racine, president of the Montreal Baseball Club and a Brooklyn Dodgers executive, died early yesterday."<!-- Bot generated title --></ref> With Racine in the Delorimier Stadium president's office, the Royals won more pennants, playoffs and Little World Series than any club in International League history to date. <ref name="walteromalley.com" />

After the Montreal Royals ceased to operate in 1960, the stadium saw limited use and was eventually torn down. Prior to the demolition of the stadium, the building was torn down in bits, and the interior was used to house makeshift classrooms as the student population in Quebec grew rapidly (due to kids staying in school longer) in the late 1960s (see External link below). The site is now occupied by the Pierre Dupuy School, a secondary school. There is a small stone memorial at the corner of the park (Ontario and Delorimier) with a bronze plaque honouring  Mr. Robinson's accomplishments.
