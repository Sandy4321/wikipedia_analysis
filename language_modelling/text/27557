The '''Baggara''' or '''Baqqarah''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: <U+0627><U+0644><U+0628><U+0642><U+0627><U+0631><U+0629>) are a nomadic [[Bedouin]] people inhabiting Africa from between [[Lake Chad]] and the [[Nile]], in the states of [[Sudan]] (particularly [[Darfur]]), [[Niger]], [[Chad]], [[Cameroon]], [[Nigeria]], and the [[Central African Republic]]. They are also known as '''[[Shuwa Arabs]]'''. They are cattle-herders, migrating seasonally between grazing lands in the wet season and river areas in the dry season. They are mostly speakers of the [[Shuwa Arabic|Shuwa]] dialect of [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. 

== Origins and divisions ==
Baggara are [[Muslim]]s, thought to be partly descendants of [[Arab]] tribes who settled the region primarily from the fourteenth to the eighteenth century, descendants of the [[Juhayna]] group of Arabs that trace their ancestry to [[Libya]]. Those Juhayna who moved south where rainfall was more plentiful, such as south of the [[Marrah Mountains]], took up the herding of [[Baggara_Cattle|cattle]] and became known as the Baggara, literally "cattelers" or "cattle people".  Their kinspeople who stayed north remained [[Abbala]], "camel-men".<ref>de Waal, Alex and Julie Flint, ''Darfur: A Short History of a Long War'', Zed Books, London March 2006, ISBN 1-84277-697-5, p. 9</ref> 

The Baggara include several tribes, such as the [[Rizeigat]], [[Ta<U+2019>isha]], [[Habbaniya]] in [[Darfur]], and [[Misseiria]], [[Humur]] and [[Hawazma]] in [[Kordofan]].   The Misseiria of [[Jebel Mun]] speak a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan language]], [[Tama language|Tama]] (also called Miisiirii.)

==History==
[[Image:Cavalier arabe du D<U+00E9>kakir<U+00E9> sur un cheval capara<U+00E7>onn<U+00E9>.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Arab horseman photographed by French Colonials, at D<U+00E9>kakir<U+00E9>, Chad. c.1910s. From ''L'Afrique <U+00C9>quatoriale Fran<U+00E7>aise: le pays, les habitants, la colonisation, les pouvoirs publics''. Pr<U+00E9>f. de M. Merlin. (published 1918).]] The Baggara of Darfur and [[Kordofan]] were the backbone of the [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdist]] revolt against Turko-Egyptian rule in Sudan in the 1880s. The Mahdi's second-in-command, the Khalifa [[Abdallahi ibn Muhammad]], was himself a Baggara of the Ta'aisha tribe. During the Mahdist period (1883-98) tens of thousands of Baggara migrated to Omdurman and central Sudan where they provided many of the troops for the Mahdist armies. After their defeat at the Battle of Karari in 1898, the remnants returned home to Darfur and Kordofan. Under the British system of indirect rule, each of the major Baggara tribes was ruled by its own paramount chief, known as Nazir. Most of them were loyal members of the Umma Party, headed since the 1960s by Sadiq el Mahdi.

The main Baggara tribes of Darfur were awarded "hawakir" (land grants) by the Fur Sultans in the 1750s. As a result, the four largest Baggara tribes of Darfur--the [[Rizeigat]], [[Habbaniya]], [[Beni Halba]] and [[Ta<U+2019>isha]]--have been only marginally involved in the [[Darfur conflict]]. However, the Baggara have been deeply involved in other conflicts in both Sudan and Chad. Starting in 1985, the Government of Sudan armed many of the local tribes among them the Rizeigat of south Darfur and the Missiriya and Hawazma of neighboring Kordofan as militia to fight  a proxy war against the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] in their areas.  In Darfur, a Benni Halba militia force was organized by the government to defeat an SPLA force led by [[Daud Bolad]] in 1990-91. However, by the mid-1990s the various Baggara groups had mostly negotiated local truces with the SPLA forces.  The leaders of the major Baggara tribes have stated that they have no interest in joining the fighting.
