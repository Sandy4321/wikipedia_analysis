'''Repetitive tunings''' are [[guitar tunings#Alternate|alternative tuning]]s for the [[guitar]]. A repetitive tuning begins with a list of notes that is duplicated, often at higher [[octave]]s. Repetition eases the learning of [[fretboard]] and [[guitar chord|chord]]s and eases [[improvisation]].

Repetitive tunings are listed after their ''period'', the number of strings after which they repeat.

==One==

The [[Ostrich guitar|trivial tuning]] repeats the same note every string, for example
:C-C-C-C-C-C.<ref name="Sethares"/>
Other trivial-tunings may repeat its note on a higher octave (or on higher octaves), for example,
:C-C-c-c-c'-c'.

==Two==
[[File:Tritone in the chromatic circle.png|right|thumb|Every [[Augmented-fourths tuning|augmented-fourths (tritone) tuning]]s repeats its two notes three times.]]

The following tunings repeat their notes on a higher octave after two strings:
* [[augmented-fourths tuning]], for example, B-F-b-f-b'-f',
* a [[cittern]] tuning, C-G-c-g-c'-g'.
There are other tunings for the cittern.<ref name="Sethares">{{harvtxt|Sethares|2011}}</ref>
