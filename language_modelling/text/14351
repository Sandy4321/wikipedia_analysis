He continued in the post after [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] became prime minister in May 1812 after Perceval's assassination, but relinquished it in July of that year. The same year he was appointed [[Lord Warden of the Stannaries]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=16632 |date=11 August 1812 |startpage=1579 }}</ref> a post he held until his death. He succeeded his father in the marquessate in 1822. The same year he was also made a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]]<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=17872 |date=23 November 1822 |startpage=1914 }}</ref> and appointed [[Vice-Admiral of Suffolk]], a post he retained until his death.

Lord Hertford was also a considerable art collector, as were his son and grandson; many of his pictures are in the [[Wallace Collection]] which they founded.<ref>[http://www.wallacecollection.org/thecollection/historyofthecollection/thecollectors/the3rdmarquessofhertford wallacecollection.org The 3rd Marquess of Hertford]</ref>

==Family==
Lord Hertford married [[Maria Seymour-Conway, Marchioness of Hertford|Maria Emilia Fagnani]], reputedly the illegitimate daughter of the [[William Douglas, 4th Duke of Queensberry|4th Duke of Queensberry]] and a married Italian aristocrat, the Marchesa Fagnani, on 18 May 1798. They had three children:

*Lady Francis Maria Seymour-Conway (d. 1822).
*[[Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford|Captain Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford]] (1800&ndash;1870).
*Lord Henry Seymour-Conway (1805&ndash;1859).

Lord Hertford was the prototype for the characters of the Marquess of Monmouth in [[Benjamin Disraeli]]'s 1844 novel, ''[[Coningsby (novel)|Coningsby]]'' and the Marquess of Steyne in [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s 1848 novel, ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]''. In his last years he was said to live with a retinue of prostitutes.<ref>Hyde, Montgomery  ''The Strange Death of Lord Castlereagh'' William Heinemann 1959 p.157</ref> [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Charles Greville]] described him as broken with infirmities and unable to speak due to paralysis of the tongue, and claimed " there has been, so far as I know, no such example of undisguised debauchery."<ref>Hyde, p.157</ref> He died in March 1842, aged 64, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Richard. The Marchioness of Hertford died in March 1856, aged 84.
