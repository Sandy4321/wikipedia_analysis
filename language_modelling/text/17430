'''''Ghost Rider''''' is a [[2007 in film|2007]] [[superhero film]] based on the [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]]. The film is directed by [[Mark Steven Johnson]] and stars [[Nicolas Cage]] as Johnny Blaze / Ghost Rider.

==Plot==
In the days of the American Old West, [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephistopheles]] sent a [[bounty hunter]] of the damned, a Ghost Rider named [[Phantom Rider#Carter Slade|Carter Slade]], to retrieve a contract for a thousand corrupt [[soul]]s from the town of San Venganza. Seeing the horror aftermath of the townfolk murdering each other, their souls traped in ghost town San Venganza had became, Slade refused to give the contract <U+2014> and therefore, the souls <U+2014> to Mephistopheles; he outran Mephistopheles and hid himself and the contract.

A century and a half later, a stunt motorcycle rider [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] ([[Matt Long]]/[[Nicholas Cage]]) discovers his father is dying of [[lung cancer]]. Mephistopheles ([[Peter Fonda]]) approaches him with a promise to rid his father of his cancer once and for all if Johnny gave his soul. Johnny inadvertently signs the contract when a spike located on its central bar breaks his [[skin]] and causes his [[blood]] to fall onto the [[parchment]]. The next morning, his father's cancer is gone; but later that same day, he dies mid-stunt in a horrific bike crash. Johnny accuses Mephistopheles regarding his father's [[death]]; Mephistopheles informs Johnny that he now owns the boy's soul, as agreed. Johnny then abandons his girlfriend, [[Roxanne Simpson]] ([[Raquel Alessi]]/[[Eva Mendes]]).

Years later, Johnny has become a stunt rider known for his dynamic stunts and for his uncanny ability to walk away from life-threatening crashes. His manager and best friend Mack ([[Donal Logue]]) speculates that Johnny must have a [[guardian angel]] protecting him. Johnny, however, speculates that it could be something else. Later, on his next stunt, he meets Roxanne again, now a journalist, and they renew their relationship.

However, [[Blackheart]] ([[Wes Bentley]]), son of Mephistopheles, comes to [[Earth]] to find the lost contract and overpower his father. He calls forth the fallen angel trio known as the Hidden, Wallow (Daniel Frederiksen), [[Gressil]] (Laurence Breuls) and [[Eligos|Abigor]] (Mathew Wilkinson), to act as his allies. To stop his son, Mephistopheles goes to Johnny and forces him to become the fiery Ghost Rider, promising to free his soul if he hunts and defeats Blackheart and the Hidden; thus turning Johnny into his personal bounty hunter. Meanwhile, Blackheart and his team have gone to an old train station, looking for an old graveyard. Johnny is driven straight to the station on his "first ride", his awakening power causing a great deal of damage to roadways and storefronts before ensorcelled [[Chopper (motorcycle)|Chopper]] brings him to the train station where he transforms fully into the Ghost Rider and a fight ensues. In the process, Johnny acquires a [[weapon]]; a length of heavy chain, using to kill Gressil while the others escaped. 

Ghost Rider is returning to town when he hears a woman ([[Rebel Wilson]]) being mugged. He saves the woman by using the [[Penance Stare]], a power by which a person is declared "guilty" and all the wrong done by that person is returned upon them, burning their soul in the process. The mugger's soul is seared and he falls to the ground, [[catatonic]]. He is condemned to a fate worse than death.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

The next day Johnny wakes up in a cemetery chapel where he meets a man called the [[Caretaker (comics)|Caretaker]] ([[Sam Elliott]]), who seems to know all about the history of the Ghost Rider. When he arrives home, Johnny finds Roxanne and reveals himself as the Devil's bounty hunter.  She leaves in anger and disbelief at his tale. As Roxanne leaves, the police arrive and take Johnny into custody for his connection to the damage done to the city and the deaths caused by Blackheart. He is put in a holding cell with some other prisoners, who mock Johnny and beat him. He becomes the Ghost Rider, then strikes down all those who have done [[violence]] to him. He spares one whom his [[intuition]] identifies as "innocent". That [[night]], Roxanne recognizes Johnny, while he (as the Ghost Rider) is fighting Abigor, in full view of the city and a large police force. Johnny destroys Abigor, faces the police then leaves. Observing after he got the location of the contract, Blackheart realizes that Roxanne is Johnny's weakness.

Johnny goes to the Caretaker, who tells him about Johnny's predecessor, [[Phantom Rider#Carter Slade|Carter Slade]], a Texas Ranger who was a man of [[honor]] before his greed placed him before the gallows for his misdeeds. Slade then made a deal with Mephistopheles to break free; in return, becoming the Ghost Rider who hid the contract of San Venganza. The Caretaker then warns Johnny to stay away from those whom Blackheart and the fallen angels can use against him. Unfortunately, after the Caretaker was later beaten to death by him, Blackheart decides to do that to get the contract.

Finding her at Johnny's apartment, reading the books pertaining to demonic lore, Blackheart kills Mack and stuns Roxanne before Johnny arrives and is assaulted by Blackheart. Transforming into the Ghost Rider, he attempts to use the Penance Stare on Blackheart, but finds his enemy is impervious due to his lack of a soul. Blackheart then proceeds to take him to bring him the contract at San Venganza or he'll kill Roxanne, warning " Johnny, don't keep me waiting." Johnny returns to the Caretaker to get the contract; the Caretaker begrudgingly gives it to him. 

The Caretaker tells Johnny that San Venganza will be "Hell on Earth" if Blackheart claims it, and admonishes Johnny to think before he acts. Johnny convinces the Caretaker that he has a plan. The Caretaker then reveals that he is Carter Slade, still alive because of his own power as a Ghost Rider, and offers to show him the way to San Venganza. They ride together into the desert <U+2013> Carter Slade on a skeletal, flaming phantom [[horse]], Johnny Blaze on his skeletally decorated, flaming motorcycle <U+2013> leaving a destructive trail of [[fire]] in their wake (and killing a lizard in the process). Some distance from the town, they both stop. Slade gives Johnny his shotgun (a sawn-off [[Winchester Model 1887/1901|Winchester Model 1887 shotgun]]) before he rides off, fading away due to his lack of [[energy]] after using it to assume his Ghost Rider form one last time. 

Johnny was momentarily held off by Wallow before he he killed the demon and arrived; Johnny gives the contract to Blackheart but becomes the Ghost Rider as he does, hoping to pummel his foe into submission. Blackheart shrugs off the attack and uses the contract to absorb the 1,000 souls, taking on the name "[[Legion (demon)|Legion]]" as he does. The fight continues; during it, Roxanne grabs the discarded shotgun, blasting Blackheart several times before tossing it to Johnny. Holding the weapon in the shadows - the source of his power - he transforms the shotgun into a Ghost Rider weapon and blasts Blackheart apart with hellfire. The souls of San Venganza restore the demon quickly but Johnny uses the Penance Stare, which is effective because Blackheart now has one thousand corrupt souls to burn. Ghost Rider then tosses Blackheart's comatose body aside, and reverts to his normal form. He is at first ashamed of his monstrous appearance before Roxanne, until she shows him that she is not afraid of what Johnny has become.

Mephistopheles appears and gives him back his soul, offering to take back the curse of the Ghost Rider. Johnny refuses, saying that he will use his power against Mephistopheles, and against all harm that comes to the innocent. Realizing he has been tricked and robbed of both a soul and the power, Mephistopheles vows to make Johnny pay; Johnny in response recites his favorite saying: "You can't live in [[fear]]"; Mephistopheles then disappears. Johnny and Roxanne share some parting words at the [[tree]] on which Johnny carved, "J&R FOREVER", at the beginning of the film. Roxanne then tells Johnny that he got his second chance just before sharing a final kiss with him. Johnny then rides away on his motorcycle, transforming into Ghost Rider just before the credits roll. The credits are accompanied by [[Spiderbait|Spiderbait's]] cover of the song "[[(Ghost) Riders in the Sky]]".

In May 2000 at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], [[Marvel Studios]] announced an agreement with Crystal Sky Entertainment to film ''Ghost Rider'' with actor [[Jon Voight]] attached as a producer.  Production was scheduled to start in early 2001 with a budget of $75 million, with actor [[Johnny Depp]] expressing interest in the lead role.<ref>{{cite news | author=Michael Sangiacomo | url= | title=More Marvel heroes to join X-Men on film over next few years | publisher=[[The Star-Ledger]] | date=[[2000-05-25]] | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref>  The following August, [[Dimension Films]] joined Crystal Sky to co-finance the film, which would be written by [[David S.

According to producer Steven Paul, Cage had found out about Depp being a possibility for the role and contacted the director to express his own interest, being an avid Ghost Rider fan.<ref>{{cite news | author=Julia Brinksneader | url= | title=Another 'ER' casualty | publisher=[[The Columbus Dispatch]] | date=[[2001-07-31]] | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref>

In the following August, Norrington abandoned the project due to a scheduling conflict, leaving to film the action flick ''Tick Tock'' starring [[Jennifer Lopez]].<ref>{{cite news | author=James Berkshire | url= | title=Cage GHOST RIDER Burning Out? | publisher=Cinescape | date=[[2001-08-20]] | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref>  Cage eventually left the project as well.  By May 2002, the studio [[Columbia Pictures]] sought to acquire rights to the film in [[turnaround (film)|turnaround]] from Dimension Films following the success of ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]''.<ref>{{cite news | author= | url= | title=`Ghost Rider' could follow Spidey film | publisher=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] | date=[[2002-05-24]] | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref>  In April 2003, under Columbia Pictures, director [[Mark Steven Johnson]] took over the helm for ''Ghost Rider'' with Cage returning for the lead role.  Both had been drawn by a script written by screenwriter [[Shane Salerno]].

===Character portrayal===
[[Image:Ghost rider bike.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Ghost Rider's motorcycle.]]

Instead of a "hard drinking and smoking bad ass" Johnny Blaze, Nicolas Cage decided to give him more depth.  "I'm playing him more as someone who... made this deal and he's trying to avoid confronting it, anything he can do to keep it away from him."  Cage also explained that Blaze's stunt riding was a form of escape and a way to keep him connected to his deceased father, who taught him to ride.  Cage rode a [[Buell Motorcycle Company|Buell]] motorcycle for Blaze's stunt cycle, and a heavily customized hardtail chopper named Grace which transforms into the "Hell Cycle", along with the character.<ref>{{cite news | author=Andrew Weil | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/featuresnews.php?id=3153 | title=SET VISIT: Nicolas Cage on ''Ghost Rider''! | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=[[2005-06-16]] | accessdate=2007-01-29 }}</ref>  The Hell Cycle's wheels, made of pure flames in the comics, were changed to be solid tires covered in flames in order to give the motorcycle more weight onscreen.<ref name="comic con">{{cite news | author=Scott Chitwood | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/featuresnews.php?id=3304 | title= The ''Ghost Rider'' Panel at Comic-Con | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=[[2005-07-17]] | accessdate=2007-01-29 }}</ref>

Davis filtered Cage's line readings through three different kinds of animal growls that were played backwards and covered separate frequencies.  Davis then amplified the dialogue through a mechanical volumizer.  Director Johnson described the sound as a "deep, demonic, mechanical lion's roar".<ref>{{cite news | author= | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/ghostridernews.php?id=3374 | title=Mark Steven Johnson on ''Ghost Rider''! | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=[[2005-08-07]] | accessdate=2007-01-29 }}</ref>
