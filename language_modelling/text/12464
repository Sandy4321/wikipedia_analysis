'''D<U+00F9>n''' (or "Dun" without the diacritic) is one of the [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]] archipelago. It is nearly a mile long. Its name simply means "fort" in [[Scottish Gaelic]] (for more information, see "[[dun]]"), but the fort itself has been lost - old maps show it on Gob an D<U+00F9>in ({{gbmappingsmall|NF109972}}), which is at the seaward end.

Almost joined to [[Hirta]] at Ruiaval, the two islands are separated by Caolas an D<U+00F9>in (the straits of D<U+00F9>n). This prevents [[Soay sheep]] from Hirta straying onto the island, and thus it is more vegetated.

The small island is home to the largest colony of [[fulmar]]s in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Prior to 1828 St Kilda was their only [[British Isles]] breeding ground but they have since spread and established colonies elsewhere such as at [[Fowlsheugh]].<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0021-8790(194111)10%3A2%3C204%3ATBDHAP%3E2.0.CO%3B2-1 Fisher, James & Waterston, George (Nov. 1941) ''The Breeding Distribution, History and Population of The Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) in the British Isles''.

D<U+00F9>n protects Village Bay on Hirta from the prevailing south-westerly winds, was at one time joined to Hirta by a natural arch.  MacLean (1972) suggests that the arch was broken when struck by a [[galleon]] fleeing the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada|Armada]], but other sources, such as Mitchell (1992), provide the more credible (if less romantic) explanation that the arch was simply swept away by one of the many fierce storms which batter the islands every winter.
