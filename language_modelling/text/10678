She was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]] with influence from [[Yoshinori Kitase]], [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] and [[Yoshitaka Amano]].

In ''Final Fantasy VII'', she is a 22-year-old woman who joins the [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]] organization [[AVALANCHE]]. As the story progresses, AVALANCHE begin to pursue the game's antagonist [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], and the player learns that she is the last surviving Cetra, or "Ancient", one of the planet's oldest races. She has also appeared in the later-released ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series.

Her voice actor is [[Maaya Sakamoto]] in Japanese. In English releases, her voice actors are singer and actress [[Mandy Moore]] in ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', actress [[Mena Suvari]] in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VII Advent Children]]'', and actress [[Andrea Bowen]] in ''[[Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII]]''. The character and the events surrounding her death in ''Final Fantasy VII'' have met with an overall positive reception from critics and fans.

==Appearances==
===''Final Fantasy VII''=== <!-- NOTE: Consensus has decided to keep her name as Aerith in the FFVII and FFT sections. Do not change it without talk page discussion, please. -->
Aerith Gainsborough is first introduced as a flower seller<!-- NOTE: A 'flower girl' is part of a wedding ceremony (see article) -->, when she briefly converses with [[Cloud Strife]], a [[mercenary]] working for the anti-government group AVALANCHE, who are fleeing from the bombing of a [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Mako|Mako]] reactor. The two later meet in Aerith's church in the Sector 5 [[slum]]s, where she is faced with the possibility of capture by [[Turks (FF7)|the Turks]]. Aerith asks Cloud to be her [[bodyguard]] for the cost of one date. She is eventually apprehended, but is ultimately rescued by Cloud and his allies. Aerith then joins them in the pursuit of Sephiroth, while also embarking on her own journey of self-discovery.

After a failed attempt to foil Sephiroth's theft of the [[Black Materia]], Aerith ventures alone into the Forgotten City. Cloud and his companions give chase, eventually finding her praying at an altar. As Aerith looks up to smile at Cloud, Sephiroth appears and kills her by impaling her through the [[Trunk (anatomy)|torso]]. Cloud carries Aerith's body out into a lake in the Forgotten City, and releases her back to the Planet. Reeve Tuesti, the head of Shinra Urban and Development, brings the news of her death to Elmyra Gainsborough, Aerith's adoptive mother. The party later learns the reason for Aerith being in the Forgotten City; through her White Materia, Aerith was able to summon Holy, the only force capable of repelling the ultimate destructive magic, Meteor, which has been summoned by Sephiroth.<ref name="holy">'''Bugenhagen:''' It says, when the time comes, we must search for "Holy". / '''Cloud:''' Holy? / '''Bugenhagen:''' Holy... the ultimate White Magic. Magic that might stand against Meteor. Perhaps our last hope to save the planet from Meteor. {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy VII]] |developer=[[Square (company)|Square]] |publisher=SCE America |date=7 September 1997 |platform=PlayStation }}</ref><ref name="holy2">'''Cloud:''' Aerith has already prayed for Holy. ... She said, she was the only one who could stop Sephiroth...... And to do that, there was a secret here... That was Holy...... That's why, she had the White Materia. {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy VII]] |developer=[[Square (company)|Square]] |publisher=SCE America |date=7 September 1997 |platform=PlayStation }}</ref> Although Aerith successfully cast Holy before her death, it is held back by the power of Sephiroth's will. When Sephiroth is finally defeated and Holy is released, it appears that it is too late to function as effectively as it should, as Meteor has already come too near to the Planet's surface. While Holy clashes with Meteor, attempting to prevent its impact, the gravity of both Meteor and the Planet pulling on Holy in opposite directions weakens it. Aerith is seen praying with both hands interlocked whilst urging the lifestream to ultimately defend the planet. <ref name="gravity">{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania <U+03A9> | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | isbn=4-7575-1520-0 | page=591}}</ref> The Planet's [[Mako (Final Fantasy VII)|Lifestream]] then flows forth, intervening between Holy and Meteor, and acting as a battering ram while aiding in the destruction of Meteor.

===''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII''===
In ''[[Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII]]'', set several years prior to the events of ''Final Fantasy VII'', Aerith becomes the target of the original incarnation of AVALANCHE, led by Elf<U+00E9>, who seek to prevent [[Shinra Electric Power Company|Shinra]] from acquiring the last surviving Cetra. Instead, AVALANCHE intend to use her to learn the whereabouts of the Promised Land for their own purposes, although a member of the Turks tries to protect her.

Aerith makes several appearances in the CGI film ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'', as Cloud's spiritual guide, urging him to move on with his life and to forgive himself for the tragedies that were beyond his control, telling him that she never blamed him for her death. During their spiritual reunion, Aerith speaks to Cloud in an open meadow laden with flowers, cheerfully and kindheartedly poking fun at how he needlessly burdens himself with the past. However, she also acknowledges his suffering and offers kind words of support.<ref>'''Aerith:''' So, why did you come? / '''Cloud:''' I think ... I want to be forgiven, more than anything. / ... / '''Cloud:''' But... I let you die... / '''Aerith:''' Dilly dally, shilly shally. Isn't it time ''you'' did the forgiving? / ... / '''Aerith:''' I never blamed you, not once. You came for me, that's all that matters. {{cite video| people = [[Tetsuya Nomura]] (Director)| date = 14 September 2005| title = [[Final Fantasy VII Advent Children]]| medium = DVD| publisher = [[Square Enix]]| time = }}</ref> One of Aerith's interactions with Cloud comes when each member of the original game's party helps in Cloud's final attack against Bahamut SIN; she appears as the last party member to assist Cloud. She also appears in the final scene of the movie, along with [[Zack Fair]], where she gives Cloud more words of encouragement before she and Zack walk into the light.<ref>'''Aerith:''' You see? Everything's all right. {{cite video| people = [[Tetsuya Nomura]] (Director)| date = 14 September 2005| title = [[Final Fantasy VII Advent Children]]| medium = DVD| publisher = [[Square Enix]]| time = }}</ref> Near the end of the film, it is discovered that water mixed with the Lifestream flows beneath the flowerbed in Aerith's church, which manifests itself as a cure for [[Geostigma]].

The ''[[On the Way to a Smile]]'' novella "Case of the Lifestream&nbsp;<U+2013> Black & White" focuses on Aerith and Sephiroth's respective journeys through the Lifestream after the end of the game but before the events of the film. The "Black" section deals with Sephiroth, the "White" section with Aerith.<ref>{{cite web | title=<U+5C0F><U+8AAC> On the Way to a Smile <U+30D5><U+30A1><U+30A4><U+30CA><U+30EB><U+30D5><U+30A1><U+30F3><U+30BF><U+30B8><U+30FC>VII| publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |language=Japanese |isbn=4757524625 }}</ref>

Aerith also appears in the prequel game ''[[Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII]]''. At the age of 16, she meets [[Zack Fair|Zack]], for whom she develops feelings during his stay in Midgar.<ref name="zack">'''Aerith:''' What a shock..... I didn't know Zack was from this town. / '''Cloud:''' You know him? / '''Aerith:''' Didn't I tell you? He was my first love. {{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy VII]] |developer=[[Square (company)|Square]] |publisher=SCE America |date=7 September 1997 |platform=PlayStation }}</ref>  Aerith and Zack develop a romantic relationship, but Zack is killed at the end of ''Crisis Core'' after being held in a Mako chamber for four years in the Shinra Mansion basement. During those years, Aerith helped her adopted mother earn a living by growing and selling flowers, a job that results in her meeting Cloud at the beginning of ''Final Fantasy VII''.

===Other appearances===
Aerith's character has appeared in several games outside of the ''Final Fantasy VII'' continuity. In ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'', she appears as a flower girl;<ref name="knave">'''Town Knave:''' I've been looking for you, Aerith... Selling flowers for your mom?

Aerith makes an appearance in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series as a member of a group dedicated to defeating the [[Nobodies|Heartless]]; the group also includes other ''Final Fantasy VII'' characters and [[Squall Leonhart|Leon]] of ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]''. In the plot of ''Kingdom Hearts'', Aerith suggests a method for defeating the Heartless to protagonists [[Donald Duck]], [[Goofy]] and [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]]. Throughout the game, she also gives advice to the player.<ref name="KHII-StrategyGuide">{{cite book| last = Hollinger| first = Elizabeth| year = 2006| title = Kingdom Hearts II Official Strategy Guide| publisher = [[BradyGames]] Publishing| isbn= 0-7440-0526-4}}</ref> She also appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'' as a perceptive figment of Sora's memories.<ref>'''Aerith:''' We don't know you, Sora, but your heart is full of memories of us together.

''Hoshi o Meguru Otome'' (''Maiden who Travels the Planet''), a novel written by Benny Matsuyama which appears in the ''Final Fantasy VII Ultimania <U+03A9>'' guide, follows Aerith's journey through the Lifestream immediately after her death in ''Final Fantasy VII''.<ref>{{cite book | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania <U+03A9> | publisher=Square Enix | author=Studio BentStuff | year=2005 | isbn=978-4757515208}}</ref> Aerith is mentioned in a graffiti in the subway station early in the animated film ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]''; the graffiti reads "Aerith Lives".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://movieline.com/2012/11/12/wreck-it-ralph-best-video-game-references-aerith-kano-konami-code/ | title=Leeroy Jenkins Lives!

==Concept and creation==
Aerith was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], with influence from director and scenario writer [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], whilst [[Yoshitaka Amano]] created conceptual artwork which also helped to influence her design. She has green eyes and long brown hair tied in a [[braid]] with a pink ribbon. She wears a long pink dress, a [[Shrug (clothing)|bolero jacket]], and brown [[hiking boot]]s. The long dress was designed to appear ladylike and as a contrast to [[Tifa Lockhart]]'s [[miniskirt]].<ref name="gamesTM-63">{{Cite news| last= gamesTM Staff|  publication-date= November 2007| title=Hall Of Fame...

Late during development, Aerith's first love was changed to [[Zack Fair]].<ref>{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania <U+03A9> | language=Japanese | publisher=Square-Enix | isbn=4-7575-1520-0 | page=525}}</ref>

Her green eyes were meant to symbolize nature and also served as another contrast to Tifa's brown eyes. Nomura did not change much of Aerith's design for ''Advent Children'', but her design was updated in ''Kingdom Hearts'' with the removal of her bolero jacket, which made her attire appear more as Amano had originally drawn her. Other changes included the addition of bracelets and a belt. Nomura modified her dress in ''Before Crisis'', adding white and green colors, and this version was also used as the basis for her design in ''Kingdom Hearts II''.<ref name="gamesTM-63"/>

Aerith's original Japanese name is <U+30A8><U+30A2><U+30EA><U+30B9> ''Earisu,'' {{IPA-ja|ea<U+027D>isu<U+0325>|pron|Aerith (Japanese).ogg}}. This was [[Transliteration|transliterated]] to "Aeris" in ''Final Fantasy VII'' and ''Final Fantasy Tactics'', but in later products has been changed to "Aerith". Both transliterations have basis, as the Japanese "su" (<U+30B9>) is used when transcribing "s" ({{IPA|/s/}}) and "th" ({{IPA|/<U+03B8>/}}) to Japanese. However, official Japanese material uses the spelling "Aerith",<ref>Final Fantasy VII instruction manual, Characters</ref><ref>V Jump Final Fantasy VII the Perfect</ref><ref>Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Ultimania</ref> and developers have stated that "Aerith" is a near-anagram of "Earth".<ref name="kaitai">{{Cite book | year=1997 | editor=Famitsu | title=Final Fantasy VII Kaitai Shinsho | language=Japanese | publisher=Famitsu | isbn=4-7577-0098-9 | page=14}}</ref> Prior to the game's release, Western [[video game journalism|gaming magazines]], such as the May 1996 issue of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', also referred to her as "Aerith".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Final Fantasy VII|journal=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=174|date=May 1996|pages=106<U+2013>111 [109]}}</ref>

In early planning stages of ''Final Fantasy VII'', Aerith was to be one of only three protagonists; herself, Cloud and Barret. During a phone call to Kitase, it was suggested that at some point in the game, one of the main characters should die, and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith. Nomura stated in a 2005 ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' interview: "Cloud's the main character, so you can't really kill him. And Barrett... {{sic}} well, that's maybe too obvious."<ref name="egm">{{cite web| title = Interivew with Yoshinori Kitase and Tetsuya Nomura from Electronic Gaming Monthly, issue No. 196, October 2005.| url = http://www.ff7citadel.com/press/int_egm.shtml| publisher = Final Fantasy VII Citadel|date=October 2005| work = [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]| accessdate =9 October 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071011164522/http://ff7citadel.com/press/int_egm.shtml| archivedate= 11 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> While designing ''Final Fantasy VII'', Nomura was frustrated with the "perennial clich<U+00E9> where the protagonist loves someone very much and so has to sacrifice himself and die in a dramatic fashion to express that love." He found this trope appeared in both films and video games from North America and Japan, and asked "Is it right to set such an example to people?"<ref name="edge">{{Cite book | year=2003 | editor=Editors of EDGE magazine | title=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]], May 2003 | pages=112<U+2013>113  | publisher=[[Future plc]]}}</ref> Kitase concluded: "In the real world things are very different. You just need to look around you. Nobody wants to die that way. People die of disease and accident. Death comes suddenly and there is no notion of good or bad. It leaves, not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness. When you lose someone you loved very much you feel this big empty space and think, 'If I had known this was coming I would have done things differently.' These are the feelings I wanted to arouse in the players with Aerith's death relatively early in the game. Feelings of reality and not [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]."<ref name="edge" />

According to Nomura, "death should be something sudden and unexpected, and Aerith's death seemed more natural and realistic." He said: "When I reflect on ''Final Fantasy VII'', the fact that fans were so offended by her sudden death probably means that we were successful with her character. If fans had simply accepted her death, that would have meant she wasn't an effective character."<ref name="egm" /> From the original release of the game, rumors have circulated that Aerith can be resurrected in or that the original plan was to have her come back, but this was scrapped in development. Nomura has categorically stated that neither of these rumors were ever true; "the world was expecting us to bring her back to life, as this is the classic convention." A lengthy petition asking for Aerith's revival by Japanese players was sent to Kitase, but he dismissed it, pointing out that "there are many meanings in Aerith's death and [her revival] could never happen."<ref name="edge" />

A [[leitmotif]] associated with Aerith is played several times throughout ''Final Fantasy VII''; it is first heard during the flashback scenes with Aerith's mother at her house, and is repeated as she is killed by Sephiroth. It was composed by famed ''Final Fantasy'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Final Fantasy Symphony&nbsp;<U+2013> Vocalists| url = http://www.ffsymphony.net/vocalists.php| publisher = Final Fantasy Symphony| accessdate =17 October 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071015035847/http://www.ffsymphony.net/vocalists.php| archivedate= 15 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The piece "Flowers Blooming in the Church" is based on it.<ref>{{cite web| title = Final Fantasy VII OST| url = http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff7ost/index.html| publisher = RPG Fan| accessdate =17 October 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071014004057/http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff7ost/index.html| archivedate= 14 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> 

"Aerith's Theme" is very popular among ''Final Fantasy'' fans, and has inspired an [[orchestra]]l version, a piano version, and a vocal version performed by the artist [[Rikki]] ( who also performed "[[Suteki Da Ne]]" for ''[[Final Fantasy X]]''). A piano arrangement of the theme appears twice in ''Advent Children'', and the track "Water" also echoes shades of the theme: the opening phrase of "Aerith's Theme" appears just prior to the climax of the track "Divinity II", which shortly thereafter includes as its final line the Latin phrase "Sola Dea fatum novit" ("Only the goddess knows fate"), and is also featured during the end credits of the film.<ref>{{cite web| title = Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Original Soundtrack :: Review| url = http://www.squareenixmusic.com/albums/f/ff7advent.shtml| publisher = Square Enix Music Online| accessdate =6 June 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080612105727/http://www.squareenixmusic.com/albums/f/ff7advent.shtml| archivedate= 12 June 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It also has been reinterpreted on the [[OverClocked ReMix]] ''Final Fantasy VII'' compilation ''[[Voices of the Lifestream]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://ff7.ocremix.org/tracks/| publisher = [[OverClocked ReMix]]| title = Tracks&nbsp;<U+2013> Final Fantasy VII: Voices of the Lifestream, an OverClocked ReMix Album| accessdate =26 September 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080912154719/http://ff7.ocremix.org/tracks/| archivedate= 12 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In 2013, "Aerith's Theme" achieved the third place in the [[Classic FM Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://halloffame.classicfm.com/2013/chart/p/50-1/#pieces-10-1 |title=Hall of Fame &#124; Classic FM |publisher=Halloffame.classicfm.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}</ref> {{-}}
