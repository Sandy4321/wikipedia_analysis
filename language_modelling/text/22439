'''I'll Be Gone''' is a [[song]] by [[Australian]] [[progressive rock]] group [[Spectrum]].
The song was released in Australia through [[EMI]] in February 1971. It was written by [[Guitarist]] and [[Vocalist]] with the group, [[Mike Rudd]] and produced by '''Howard Gable'''.

The song's highest chart position on the national [[Top 40]] was number one, while it reached Top 5 in [[Melbourne]], [[Sydney]] and [[Brisbane]]. Unfortunately [[Spectrum]] would never ever repeat the success of "I'll Be Gone.

In [[1984]] [[Australian]] [[Country Music]] singer [[John Williamson]], paid tribute to the song by recording his own version, a version which kept the originality but also suited his own brand of country music.

Several other versions of '''I'll Be Gone''' have been recorded by artists including [[Colleen Hewett]], [[Margret RoadKnight]] and [[Manfred Mann's Earth Band]].  The latter was released, along with '''I'll Be Gone''''s B side '''Launching Place Part II''', on [[Manfred Mann's Earth Band]]'s 1974 LP [[The Good Earth]].

Since it's release more than 30 years ago, the song has become an [[FM Radio]] staple, evidence has recently been provided with the [[4MMM]] "Essential 2006" countdown of listeners favourite songs of all time, [[I'll Be Gone]] came in at a very complimentary 331.
