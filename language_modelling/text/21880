In traditional societies, '''myth and ritual''' are two central components of religious practice.  Although [[Mythology|myth]] and [[ritual]] are commonly united as parts of [[religion]], the exact relationship between them has been a matter of controversy among scholars. One of the approaches to this problem is "the myth and ritual, or myth-ritualist, theory", which holds that "myth does not stand by itself but is tied to ritual".<ref>Segal, p. 61</ref> This theory has never been demonstrated, and the current view among scholar is that the link between myth and ritual is that they share common [[Paradigmatic analysis|paradigms]].<ref>Meletinsky, p.117</ref>

== Overview ==
Historically, the important approaches to the study of [[mythological]] thinking have been those of [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Schiller]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]], [[Freud]], [[L<U+00E1>vy-Bruhl]], [[Levi-Strauss]], [[Northrop Frye|Frye]], the [[Soviet school]], and the Myth and Ritual School.<ref>Guy Lanoue, Foreword to Meletinsky, p.viii</ref>

In the 1930s, Soviet researchers such as [[Jakov E. Golosovker]], [[Frank-Kamenecky]], [[Olga Freidenberg]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], "grounded the study of myth and ritual in [[folklore]] and in the [[world view]] of [[popular culture]]."<ref>Meletinsky, p.109-110</ref>

The "Myth and ritual school" is the name given to a series of authors that have focused their [[philological]] studies on the "ritual purposes of myths".<ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica entries on [http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-400991/Myth-and-Ritual-School Myth and Ritual School (religion)]</ref> They include the supporters of the "priority of ritual over myth" hypothesis, [[W. Robertson-Smith]], [[James Frazer]], [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], [[S. H. Hooke]], that claimed that "every myth is derived from a particular ritual and that the [[syntagmatic]] quality of myth is a reproduction of the succession of ritual act".<ref>Meletinsky, p.117</ref>

The [[semantic]] unity of myth and ritual has been demonstrated by anthropology research works made in the period following the World War II, particularly by [[Bill Stanner]] and [[Victor Turner]]; however, hypotheses of a relation of descent, as the "priority of ritual over myth", have not. The major view held currently in the field is that the link between myth and ritual is that they share common [[Paradigmatic analysis|paradigms]].<ref>Meletinsky, p.117</ref>

== Ritual from myth ==
One possibility immediately presents itself: perhaps ritual arose from myth. Many religious rituals--notably [[Passover]] among Jews, [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]] among Christians, and the [[Hajj]] among Muslims--commemorate, or involve commemoration of, events in religious literature.

===E. B. Tylor===
Leaving the sphere of historical religions, the ritual-from-myth approach often sees the relationship between myth and ritual as analogous to the relationship between science and technology. The pioneering anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] is the classic exponent of this view.<ref>Segal, p. 63</ref> He saw myth as an attempt to explain the world: for him, myth was a sort of proto-science.<ref>Segal, p. 14</ref> Ritual is secondary: just as technology is an application of science, so ritual is an application of myth--an attempt to produce certain effects, given the supposed nature of the world: "For Tylor, myth functions to explain the world as an end in itself.  Ritual applies that explanation to control the world."<ref>Segal, p. 63</ref> A ritual always presupposes a preexisting myth: in short, myth gives rise to ritual.

== Myth from ritual ==

Against the intuitive idea that ritual reenacts myth or tries to persuade mythical beings, many 19th century anthropologists argued the opposite position: that myth and religious doctrine result from ritual.

===William Robertson Smith===
This view, also known as "primacy of ritual", was dogmatically pioneered by the bible scholar [[William Robertson Smith]].<ref>Meletinsky p.19</ref> In his ''Lectures on the Religion of the Semites'', he draws a distinction between ancient and modern religion: in modern religion, doctrine is central; in ancient religion, ritual is central.<ref>Segal, p. 61</ref> On the whole, Smith argues, ancients tended to be relatively conservative with regard to rituals, making sure to pass them down faithfully; in contrast, the myths that justified those rituals could change. In fact, Smith claims that the myths that have come down to us are usually those that arose "after the original, nonmythic reason [...] for the ritual had somehow been forgotten".<ref>Segal, p. 62</ref>

As an example, Smith gives the worship of [[Adonis]]. Worshipers mourned Adonis's mythical death in a ritual that coincided with the annual withering of the vegetation. According to Smith, the ritual mourning had originally had a nonmythical explanation: with the annual withering of plants, "the worshippers lament out of natural sympathy [...] just as modern man is touched with melancholy at the falling of autumn leaves".<ref>Smith, p. 392</ref> Once worshipers forgot the original, nonmythical reason for the mourning ritual, they created "the myth of Adonis as the dying and rising god of vegetation [...] to account for the ritual".<ref>Segal, p. 63</ref>

===Stanley Edgar Hyman===
In his essay "The Ritual View of Myth and the Mythic," Stanley Edgar Hyman makes an argument similar to Smith's:
<blockquote>"In Fiji [...] the physical peculiarities of an island with only one small patch of fertile soil are explained by a myth telling how Mberewalaki, a culture hero, flew into a passion at the misbehavior of the people of the island and hurled all the soil he was bringing them in a heap, instead of laying it out properly.  Hocart points out that the myth is used aetiologically to explain the nature of the island, but did not originate in that attempt. The adventures of Mberewalaki originated, like all mythology, in ritual performance, and most of the lore of Hocart's Fijian informants consisted of such ritual myths.  When they get interested in the topology of the island or are asked about it, Hocart argues, they do precisely what we would do, which is ransack their lore for an answer."<ref>''Myth: A Symposium'', pg. 91</ref></blockquote>
Here Hyman argues against the aetiological interpretation of myth, which says that myths began as explanations for the origins of natural phenomena.  If true, the aetiological interpretation would make myth older than, or at least independent of, ritual--as E.B. Tylor believes it is. But Hyman argues that traditional man only uses myth for aetiological purposes after myth is already in place. For scholars like Smith and Hyman, myth appears only as a justification for ritual after people forget ritual's original purpose.

===James Frazer===
The famous anthropologist [[Sir James George Frazer]] claimed that myth emerges out of ritual during the natural process of religious evolution. In ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', Frazer famously argues that man progresses from belief in magic (and rituals based on magic), through belief in religion, to science.<ref>Frazer, pg. 711''</ref> His argument is as follows.

Man starts out with a reflexive belief in a natural law, and he assumes that he can influence nature by the correct application this law: "In magic man depends on his own strength to meet the difficulties and dangers that beset him on every side. He believes in a certain established order of nature on which he can surely count, and which he can manipulate for his own ends."<ref>Frazer, pg. 711''</ref>

However, the natural law man imagines--namely, magic--does not work. When he sees that his pretended natural law is false, man gives up the idea of a knowable natural law and <U+201C>throws himself humbly on the mercy of certain great invisible beings behind the veil of nature, to whom he now ascribes all those far-reaching powers which he once arrogated to himself.<U+201D><ref>Frazer, pg. 711</ref> In other words, when man loses his belief in magic, he justifies his formerly magical rituals by saying that they reenact myths or honor mythical beings. Frazer argues that
<blockquote>"myth changes while custom remains constant; men continue to do what their fathers did before them, though the reasons on which their fathers acted have been long forgotten.  The history of religion is a long attempt to reconcile old custom with new reason, to find a sound theory for an absurd practice."<ref>Frazer, pg. 477</ref></blockquote>

===Jane Ellen Harrison and S. H. Hooke===
The classicist [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] and the biblical scholar [[S. H. Hooke]] regarded myth as intimately connected to ritual. However, "against Smith", they "vigorously deny" that myth's main purpose is to justify a ritual by giving an account of how it first arose (e.g., justifying the Adonis worshipers' ritual mourning by attributing it to Adonis's mythical death)<ref>Segal, p. 71</ref>. Instead, these scholars think a myth is largely just a narrative description of a corresponding ritual: according to Harrison, "the primary meaning of myth ... is the spoken correlative of the acted rite, the thing done".<ref>Harrison; quoted in Segal (no specific text cited), p. 72</ref>

Harrison and Hooke given an explanation for why ancients would feel the need to describe the ritual in a narrative form. They suggest that the spoken word, like the acted ritual, was considered to have magical potency: "The spoken word had the efficacy of an act."<ref>Hooke; quoted in Segal (no specific text cited), p. 72</ref>

Like Frazer, Harrison believed that myths could arise as the initial reason for a ritual was forgotten or became diluted. As an example, she cited rituals that center on the annual renewal of vegetation. Such rituals often involve a participant who undergoes a staged death and resurrection. Harrison argues that the ritual, although "performed annually, was exclusively initiatory";<ref>Segal, p. 71</ref> it was performed on people to initiate them into their roles as full-standing members of society. At this early point, the "god" was simply "the projection of the euphoria produced by the ritual".<ref>Segal, p. 71</ref> Later, however, this euphoria became personified as a distinct god, and this god later became the god of vegetation, for "just as the initiates symbolically died and were reborn as fully fledged members of society, so the god of vegetation and in turn crops literally died and were reborn".<ref>Segal, p. 71</ref> In time, people forgot the ritual's initiatory function and only remembered its status as a commemoration of the Adonis myth.<ref>Segal, p. 71</ref>

== Myth and ritual as non-coextensive ==
Not all students of mythology think ritual emerged from myth or myth emerged from ritual: some allow myths and rituals a greater degree of freedom from one another. Although myths and rituals often appear together, these scholars do not think every myth has or had a corresponding ritual or vice versa.

===Walter Burkert===
The classicist [[Walter Burkert]] assumes that myths and rituals were originally independent.<ref>Segal, p. 76</ref> When myths and rituals do come together, he argues, they do so to reinforce each other. A myth that tells how the gods established a ritual reinforces that ritual by giving it divine status: "Do this because the gods did or do it."<ref>Segal, p. 76</ref> A ritual based on a mythical event makes the story of that event more than a mere myth: the myth becomes more important because it narrates an event whose imitation is considered sacred.<ref>Segal, p. 76</ref>

Furthermore, Burkert argues that myth and ritual together serve a "socializing function".<ref>Segal, p. 77</ref> As an example, Burkert gives the example of hunting rituals. Hunting, Burkert argues, took on a sacred, ritualistic aura once it ceased to be necessary for survival: "Hunting lost its basic function with the emergence of agriculture some ten thousand years ago. But hunting ritual had become so important that it could not be given up."<ref>Burkert (1979), p. 55</ref> By performing the ritual of hunting together, an ancient society bonded itself together as a group, and also provided a way for its members to vent their anxieties over their own aggressiveness and mortality.<ref>Segal, p. 78</ref>

===Bronislaw Malinowski===
Like William Smith, the anthropologist [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] argued that myths function as fictitious accounts of the origin of rituals, thereby providing a justification for those rituals: myth "gives rituals a hoary past and thereby sanctions them".<ref>Segal, p. 73</ref> However, Malinowski also points out that many cultural practices besides ritual have related myths: for Malinowski, "myth and ritual are therefore not coextensive".<ref>Segal, p. 73</ref> In other words, not all myths are outgrowths of ritual, and not all rituals are outgrowths of myth.

===Mircea Eliade===
Like Malinowski, the religious scholar [[Mircea Eliade]] thinks one important function of myth is to provide an explanation for ritual. Eliade notes that, in many societies, rituals are considered important precisely because they were established by the mythical gods or heroes.<ref>Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 7</ref> Eliade approvingly quotes Malinowski's claim that a myth is "a narrative resurrection of a primeval reality".<ref>Malinowski, ''Myth in Primitive Psychology'' (1926; reprinted in ''Magic, Science and Religion'' [New York: 1955], pp. 101, 108), quoted in Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 20</ref> Eliade adds: "Because myth relates the ''gesta'' [deeds] of Supernatural Beings [...] it becomes the exemplary model for all significant human actions".<ref>Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 6</ref> Traditional man sees mythical figures as models to be imitated. Therefore, societies claim that many of their rituals were established by mythical figures, thereby making the rituals seem all the more important. However, also like Malinowski, Eliade notes that societies use myths to sanction all sorts of activities, not just rituals: "For him, too, then, myth and ritual are not coextensive"<ref>Segal, p. 73</ref>

Eliade goes beyond Malinowski by giving an explanation for why myth can confer such an importance upon ritual: according to Eliade, "when [ritually] enacted myth acts as a time machine, carrying one back to the time of the myth and thereby bringing one closer to god".<ref>Segal, p. 73</ref> But, again, for Eliade myth and ritual are not coextensive: the same return to the mythical age can be achieved through myth alone, without ritual. According to Eliade, traditional man sees both myths and rituals as vehicles for "eternal return" to the mythical age (see [[Eternal return (Eliade)]]):<blockquote>"In imitating the exemplary acts of a god or of a mythic [[hero]], or simply by recounting their adventures, the man of an archaic society detaches himself from profane time and magically re-enters the Great Time, the sacred time."<ref>Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p. 23</ref> </blockquote> Recital of myths and enactment of rituals serve a common purpose: they are two different means to remain in sacred time.
