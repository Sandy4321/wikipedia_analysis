'''Route 47''' is a [[Connecticut]] state highway from [[U.S. Route 6|US 6]] in [[Woodbury, Connecticut|Woodbury]] to [[U.S. Route 202|US 202]] in [[Washington, Connecticut|Washington]], in the west-central part of the state.  It is 12.27 miles long and runs roughly northwest-southeast, signed north-south.

== Route description ==

Route 47 begins at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 6 (Connecticut)|U.S. Route 6]] in North Woodbury and heads northwestward as ''Washington Road''. It crosses the [[Nonewaug River]] 0.6 miles later, then [[Route 132 (Connecticut)|Route 132]] (for [[Bethlehem, Connecticut|Bethlehem]]) splits off to the north after another 0.7 miles . The road then travels for 3.5 miles through rural northwestern Woodbury and enters the town of [[Roxbury, Connecticut|Roxbury]]. Route 47 travels briefly through the northeast corner of Roxbury where it is known as ''Washington-Woodbury Road''. After 0.8 miles, Route 47 then enters the town of [[Washington, Connecticut|Washington]], becoming ''Woodbury Road''. After another 2.4 miles through rural southern Washington, Route 47 meets with [[Route 199 (Connecticut)|Route 199]] in the town center. Continuing north as ''Green Hill Road'' for another mile, Route 47 soon crosses the [[Shepaug River]] into Washington Depot, where it has a junction with [[Route 109 (Connecticut)|Route 109]]. Route 47 and Route 109 turn right together on ''Bee Brook Road'' as they leave the village. Route 109 splits off to the east (for [[Morris, Connecticut|Morris]]) about 0.3 miles later while Route 47 heads north. Route 47 re-crosses the Shepaug River in the vicinity of the Bee Brook Rest Area, a picnic area along the highway. The road ends after another 1.9 miles at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 202]] in northern Washington, just east of [[New Preston]].<ref name=ctlog/>

== History ==
In October 1803, the Woodbury to Washington road was chartered as a toll road known as the '''Washington Turnpike'''. It ran from Woodbury center through Washington center up to the village of [[New Preston, Connecticut|New Preston]]. The turnpike used modern Route 47 from Woodbury to [[Washington Depot, Connecticut|Washington Depot]], then used Baldwin Hill Road to reach New Preston. In 1922, most main highways in Connecticut were now managed by the state highway department. The Washington Turnpike alignment had been designated as '''State Highway 154'''. The new state highway had a slightly different northern alignment, using Bee Brook Road instead of Baldwin Hill Road. In the [[1932 state highway renumbering (Connecticut)|1932 state highway renumbering]], old Highway 154 became Route 47. No major changes have occurred since then.<ref>[http://www.kurumi.com/roads/ct/ctx45.html#47 Connecticut Roads, Route 47]</ref>
