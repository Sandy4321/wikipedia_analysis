The '''Coast Range Arc''' was a large [[volcanic arc]] system, extending from northern [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] through [[British Columbia]] and the [[Alaska Panhandle]] to southwestern [[Yukon]].<ref name="KO">{{cite book | last = Stowell | first = Harold H. | coauthors = McClelland William C. | title = Tectonics of the Coast Mountains, Southeastern Alaska and British Columbia |publisher = [[Geological Society of America]] |year = |month = |pages = 101 |url = http://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&id=5SgAthT0MuAC&dq=tectonics+of+the+Coast+Mountains+southeastern+Alaska+and+British+Columbia&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=VTbyAo5kZR&sig=p9GFjhGDysA1miKDghAvzNQnMf8&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result |isbn = 0-8137-2343-4 |accessdate =2008-09-04}}</ref> The Coast Range Arc lies along the western margin of the [[North American Plate]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]] of western [[North America]]. Although taking its name from the [[Coast Mountains]], this term is a geologic grouping rather than a geographic one, and the Coast Range Arc extended south into the [[Cascade Range|High Cascades]] of the [[Cascade Range]], past the [[Fraser River]] which is the northward limit of the Cascade Range proper.

The Coast Range Arc formed as a result of [[subduction]] of the [[Kula Plate|Kula]] and pre-existing [[Farallon Plate]]s. It is most famous for being the largest [[granite|granitic]] outcropping in North America,<ref name="SI"/> which then it is usually referred to as the '''Coast Plutonic Complex''' or the '''Coast Mountains Batholith'''. It is a coast-parallel continental volcanic arc similar to the [[Andes]] of [[South America]] and the largest  [[continent]]ial volcanic arc fossil in the world.<ref name="DF">{{cite web|publisher=Carlson R.W.|url=http://geoweb.princeton.edu/people/hollister/H_and_A.pdf |title=Formation of new continental crust in Western British Columbia during transpression and transtension |accessdate=2008-09-04}}</ref>

===Evolution===
[[Image:Late Cretaceous Coast Mountains plate tectonics.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Plate tectonics of the Coast Range Arc about 75 million years ago]]
Volcanism in the arc began during the [[Late Cretaceous]] period 100 million years ago based on [[andesite|andesitic]] composition of the [[Early Cretaceous]] volcanic sections and their close temporal and spatial association with masses of [[felsic]] [[intrusive]] [[igneous rock]] with [[phaneritic]] texture called [[tonalite]].<ref name="KO"/> The basement of the Coast Range Arc was likely Early Cretaceous and [[Late Jurassic]] intrusions.<ref name="KO"/> Stratigraphic and field relations in the arc suggest that the Coast Range Arc was created on [[Stikinia]], a geologic feature that formed in an older volcanic arc environment during the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]] periods.<ref name="KO"/>

One of the major events during the Coast Range Arc was about 85 million years ago when a huge [[rift]] developed near the center of the oceanic [[Farallon Plate]]. This rifting event created the oceanic [[Kula Plate]].<ref name="SI"/> It is unknown why such a large rupture of the Farallon Plate occurred.<ref name="SI"/> Some geologists believe some fundamental change in convection within the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] caused the rifting event, while others believe the huge oceanic plate became mechanically unstable as it continued to subduct beneath the Pacific Northwest.<ref name="SI"/> The Kula Plate once again continued to subduct beneath the continental margin, supporting the Coast Range Arc.<ref name="SI"/>

Volcanism began to decline along the length of the arc about 60 million years ago during the [[Albian]] and [[Aptian]] [[faunal stage]]s of the Cretaceous period as the rapid northern movement of the Kula Plate became parallel with the Pacific Northwest, creating a [[transform fault|transform fault plate boundary]] similar to the [[Queen Charlotte Fault]].<ref name="KO"/><ref name="SI"/> During this passive plate boundary, the Kula Plate began subducting underneath [[Alaska]] and southwestern [[Yukon]] at the northern end of the arc during the early [[Eocene]] period.

The Coast Range Arc was home to some of the world's most dangerous and explosive volcanoes. Cataclysmic eruptions at the British Columbia<U+2013>Yukon border created a huge nested [[caldera]] called the [[Bennett Lake Volcanic Complex]] about 50 million years ago during the early [[Eocene]] period. These eruptions were from vents along arcuate fracture systems associated with the caldera, which discharged about {{convert|850|km3}} of pyroclastic material.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lambert | first = Maurice B. | pages = 39 | title = Volcanoes | year =1978 |publisher = [[Energy, Mines and Resources Canada]] | location = [[North Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] |isbn = 0-88894-227-3}}</ref> This volcanic event occurred shortly before nearly all the Kula Plate had been subducted beneath the North American Plate about 40 million years ago.

Since the end of the Coast Range Arc about 50 million years ago, many volcanoes have disappeared from [[erosion]].<ref name="SI"/> What remains of the Coast Range Arc to this day are [[granite|granitic]] [[intrusion]]s, which were formed when magma intruded and cooled at depth beneath the volcanoes.<ref name="SI">{{cite web|publisher=Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture|url=http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/geo_history_wa/Coast%20Range%20Episode.htm |title=The Coast Range Episode (115 to 57 million years ago)|accessdate=2008-04-09}}</ref> However, remnants of some volcanoes exist in southwestern Yukon, including [[Montana Mountain]], [[Mount Nansen (Yukon)|Mount Nansen]], and the [[Bennett Lake Volcanic Complex|Bennett Lake]], [[Mount Skukum Volcanic Complex|Mount Skukum]] and [[Sifton Range volcanic complex]]es.

Many granitic rocks of the Coast Range Arc are plentiful in the North Cascades of the Cascade Range, which is the southernmost boundary of the arc.<ref name="SI"/> Here, these granites intruded highly deformed ocean rocks and assorted fragments from pre-existing island arcs, largely remnants of the ancient [[Bridge River Ocean]] which lay between North America and the pre-existing [[Insular Islands]].<ref name="SI"/> Massive amounts of molten granite injected over this period, burning the old oceanic sediments into a glittering medium-grade [[metamorphic rock]] called [[schist]].<ref name="SI"/>

The older intrusions of the Coast Range Arc were then deformed under the heat and pressure of later intrusions, turning them into a layered metamorphic rock known as [[gneiss]].<ref name="SI"/> In some places, mixtures of older intrusive rocks and the original oceanic rocks have been distorted and warped under intense heat, weight and stress to create unusual swirled patterns known as [[migmatite]], appearing to have been nearly melted in the procedure.<ref name="SI"/> The remarkable migmatite of the [[Chelan, Washington|Chelan]] and [[Skagit County, Washington|Skagit]] areas in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] are well-known in geologic circles.<ref name="SI"/> During construction of intrusions 70 and 57 million years ago, the northern motion of the [[Kula Plate]] might have been between {{convert|140|and(-)|110|mm}} per year.<ref name="KC">{{cite web|publisher=[[University of Arizona]]|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/tectonics/Ducea/Batholiths/Tectonics.htm|title=Tectonic overview of the CPC|accessdate=2008-09-07}}</ref> However, other geologic studies determined the Kula Plate moved at a rate as fast as {{convert|200|mm}} per year.<ref name="KC"/>

Intrusions of the Coast Range Arc are intruded by widespread [[basalt]]ic [[dike (geology)|dikes]]. These dikes, although not voluminous, provide an important sampling of the post-arc [[lithosphere]]. Additionally, widespread [[volcanic belt]]s, such as the [[Anahim Volcanic Belt]], lie in the middle of the Coast Range Arc. Volcanics that form the Anahim Volcanic Belt are not strictly related to Coast Range Arc subduction, but might have formed as a result of the North American Plate sliding over a place that has experienced active volcanism for a long period of time which is described as the [[Anahim hotspot]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes- Anahim volcanic belt | work = Natural Resources Canada | publisher = [[Geological Survey of Canada]] | date = 2008-02-13 | url = http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/belt_anahim_e.php | doi = | accessdate = 2008-06-14}}</ref> During its formation, it lay beneath granitic intrusions of the Coast Range Arc. The approximately {{convert|20|km|0|adj=on}} long Bella Bella and approximately {{convert|6|km|0|adj=on}} long Gale Passage [[dike swarm]]s lie in granitic intrusions of the Coast Range Arc and are used to calculate the first appearance of the Anahim hotspot about 13 and 12 million years ago.<ref name=QW>{{cite book | last = Ernst | first = Richard E.| coauthors = Kenneth L.
