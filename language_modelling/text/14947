==History==

The original castle was built at the end of the 11th century, making it one of the oldest castles in the Auvergne.<ref>''Le Guide du patrimoine en  France'',  pg. 107</ref> It belonged to the Counts, and then the Dauphins, of Auvergne, and it guarded a pass through which ran the old Roman road from Clermont to [[Puy-en-Velay]]. Its name came from the Latin word [[Oppidum]] from the Gallo-Roman hilltop fortress towns of the region. The first castle had an interior court surrounded by five towers, three of which still stand. In the 12th century a taller square castle keep with crenolation replaced one of the corner towers. The castle was captured by the English in 1381, then recaptured in 1393 by Marechal Boucicault and Marechal Sancerre.

In 1613, the castle became the property of Antoine de Ribeyre, the treasurer of France under the very young King [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]. Ribeyre transformed it from a fortress  into an elegant residence in the style of the period; he built a ceremonial entrance, an interior stairway, and large windows, and created ornamental gardens on two terraces overlooking the valley.

In 1940 and 1941, the castle was the home and later hiding place of General [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]], a hero of the Free French Army. During the German occupation, he established a school for officers for the new French army. in Opme, and later escaped France to join the Free French forces of General DeGaulle. The inner courtyard of the Chateau has a small museum of photos and objects relating to his stay there.

The castle was classified as an historic monument in 1916, and the gardens were classified in 1969.
