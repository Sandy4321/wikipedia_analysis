'''Alexander Stoddart''' (born in [[Edinburgh]], 1959) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] sculptor, who, since 2008, has been [[Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland|Her Majesty's Sculptor in Ordinary in Scotland]]. He works primarily on figurative sculpture in clay within the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical tradition]]. Stoddart is best known for his civic monuments, including {{convert|10|ft|m}} bronze statues of David Hume and Adam Smith, philosophers during the Scottish Enlightenment, on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh, and others of [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[John Witherspoon]]. Stoddart says of his own motivation, "My great ambition is to do sculpture for Scotland", primarily through large civic monuments to figures from the country's past.<ref name='telegraph'/>

He was raised in [[Paisley]], Scotland, where he developed an early interest in the arts and music, and later trained in fine art at the [[Glasgow School of Art]] (1976<U+2013>1980) and read the [[History of Art]] at the [[University of Glasgow]]. During this time he became increasingly critical of contemporary trends in art, such as [[pop art]], and concentrated on creating figurine pieces in clay. Stoddart associates the lack of form in modern art with social decay, by contrast, his works include many classical allusions.

===Early life===
Stoddart's grandfather was an evangelical Baptist preacher, and his parents met through that church.<ref name='guardian'>Jack, Ian [http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2009/jun/06/alexander-stoddart-interview Set in stone] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 6 June 2009. Retrieved 01 November 2010.</ref>  He was born in Edinburgh, though his father, also an artist, moved the family to [[Paisley]], where the young Stoddart immediately noticed the monument there to [[William Wallace]]. Stoddart continues to live and work in the town. At school Stoddart became interested in music (and remains so) but decided he was not good enough to become a professional.<ref name='guardian'/>

===Education===
Stoddart went, aged seventeen, to train in fine art at the [[Glasgow School of Art]] where he studied from 1976 to 1980. There he settled on sculpture and initially worked within the modernist vogue.<ref name='guardian'/> Stoddart has recalled an epiphany moment several times: when, after finishing a riveted metal pop-art sculpture (praised by his tutors) he found a bust of the [[Apollo Belvedere]], "I thought my pop-riveted thing was rubbish by comparison. It's extraordinarily easy to pop-rivet two bits of metal together and extraordinarily difficult to make a figure like the Apollo, but I thought I had to try."<ref name='guardian'/><ref name='scotsman'/>

Stoddart wrote his undergraduate thesis on the life and work of [[John Mossman]], an English sculptor who worked in Scotland for fifty years. His work remains an influence on Stoddart.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nisbet|first=Gary|publisher=Glasgow <U+2013> City of Sculpture |title =Alexander (Sandy) Stoddart | url =http://glasgowsculpture.com/pg_biography.php?sub=stoddart_a | accessdate = 2008-01-06 }}</ref>
Stoddart graduated in 1980 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, first class, though he was demoralised by his peers ignorance of the [[Old Masters]]--the name [[Raphael]] meant nothing to them"--and so went to read History of Art at the [[University of Glasgow]].<ref name='guardian'/> Afterwards, he worked for six "difficult" years in the studio of [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]].<ref name='scotsman'/> Though Hamilton Finlay is considered one of the most important Scottish artists of the 20th century, Stoddart profoundly disagrees with his working methods: "Finlay was the godfather of a problem that's rampant everywhere today. He called the people who made his work 'collaborators'. What we call them nowadays is 'fabricators'. They're talented people who are plastically capable, but they never meet their 'artist'. They're grateful, desperate and thwarted."<ref name='guardian'/>  

He is an Honorary Professor at the [[University of the West of Scotland]].<ref name="Alexander Stoddart CV">{{cite web|title =Alexander Stoddart CV| url =http://www.alexanderstoddart.com/biography/cv.html | accessdate = 2008-01-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080120132646/http://www.alexanderstoddart.com/biography/cv.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-01-20}}</ref>
On 30 December 2008, it was announced that Stoddart had been appointed [[Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland|Her Majesty's Sculptor in Ordinary in Scotland]].<ref>[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2008/12/23110750 No ordinary sculptor] The Scottish Government, 30 December 2008.

==Aesthetic viewpoint==
Stoddart is deeply critical of modernism and contemporary art, and scornful of "public art", a phrase which makes him search for "a glass of whisky and a revolver".<ref name='guardian'/> He has repeatedly criticised winners of the [[Turner Prize]], such as [[Damien Hirst]] "there's plenty of them",  and [[Tracey Emin]], whom he calls "the high priestess of societal decline".<ref name='guardian'/> Stoddart said of his own repeated public denouncements, "Somebody will be exhibiting a bunch of bananas in a gallery, and they'll [radio producers] get me on to talk dirty about it".<ref name='guardian'/> Stoddart has characterised modern art as dominated by left-wing politics, to the extent that "certain artistic forms likewise became suspect: the tune; the rhyme; the moulding; the plinth" as coercive and overly traditional.<ref name='spectator'>Stoddart, Alexander [http://www.spectator.co.uk/arts-and-culture/featured/797141/part_2/how-the-west-was-won.thtml How the West Was Won] ''[[The Spectator]]'', 28 June 2008. Retrieved 1 November 2010.</ref>  He argued that an equestrian statue of the [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Mariner King, William IV]] should be placed on the [[Fourth plinth|fourth plinth]] in [[Trafalgar Square]], as originally intended.<ref name='spectator'/>
{{quotebox|A painting by Titian is like a Leningrad, holding out against the forces of the world... Whereas the art of Tracey Emin is a complete capitulation to the world.

He developed an interest in music at school, where he learned to play the piano, which he still does daily. He called his own medium, [[sculpture]] "an art inferior to the super-art of music" and nominated Wagner as the greatest composer.<ref name='scotsman'/>

Stoddart works within the neo-classical tradition of art, and believes that greatness and respect for posterity are important considerations. In 2010 he rebuffed a query about his interest in sculpting a memorial to [[Bill McLaren]], a rugby broadcaster. <U+201C>I do not do sportsmen and I certainly do not do sports commentators. I do artists, philosophers and poets", he said,  warning that memorials are often hastily erected.<ref name='mcclaren'>{{cite news|publisher=Times Online |title=Sculptor sneers at Bill McLaren tribute by Marc Horne | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article7000234.ece | accessdate = 2009-03-11 }}</ref> Advocates of the memorial described the remarks as insensitive, and said that "To have Bill looking down on the fans at Murrayfield, microphone in hand, would bring a huge smile to so many faces.<U+201D><ref name='mcclaren'/>

Despite their idiomatic differences, Raymond McKenzie argues that the works of both Hamilton-Finlay and Stoddart combine formal and intellectual elegance with sharp, sometimes satirical critiques of contemporary society.<ref> McKenzie (2001:499)</ref>

===Civic monuments===

In his own work, Stoddart has developed "heroic-realist" neo-classical representations of historical figures.<ref name="Alexander Stoddart CV" />
Stoddart works as a civic-monumentalist for Scotland, and described the need his work fills thus: "We need serious monuments which don't have the Braveheart touch. If we're to be a nation, we need that. Fletcher of Saltoun is absolutely urgent if we're to show we mean business. We don't do it with a stupid Parliament building that looks like a Barcelona-inspired cafeteria. It's a bloody outrage."<ref name='scotsman'>[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/features/Alexander-Stoddart-interview-39I-believe.4717087.jp Alexander Stoddart interview: 'I believe in the elite for all'] ''[[The Scotsman]]'' 22 November 2008.

He has made sculptures of [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]], philosophers of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], which stand in the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. Hume is depicted in a  philosopher's toga, representing the timelessness of philosophical thought, a decision which was criticised as atavistic after the unveiling in 1996, though Stoddart remained stoic, "So here I discovered that the right thing, done in public, will often earn one great disapproval: a lesson for life <U+2013> in the modern age at least."<ref name='guardian'/> Local philosophy students soon began a tradition of rubbing the statue's toe to absorb some of his knowledge. Though Stoddart placed the foot over the edge of the plinth to encourage such engagement, the irony of the practice given Hume's critiques of superstition has been remarked upon.<ref>Wiseman, Richard [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/education/article5992248.ece It moved me:Statue of David Hume on the Royal Mile] ''The Times'', 29 March 2009.

Smith, a philosopher who forged the new discipline of [[economics]], is, by contrast, depicted in contemporary attire, showing his concern for the practical matters of economic activity, a gown draped over his shoulder retains the connection to philosophy and academia.<ref name='telegraph'>Aslet, Clive [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3556356/Alexander-Stoddart-talking-statues.html Alexander Stoddart:talking statues] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 12 July 2008. Retrieved 1 November 2010.</ref> Smith's economic ideas are also encoded into the statue: the plough behind him represents the agrarian economics he supplanted, the beehive before, is a symbol of the industry he predicted would come. His hand, resting on a globe, is obscured by the gown: a literal presentation of Smith's famous metaphor of the [[invisible hand]].<ref>[http://www.adamsmith.org/the-adam-smith-statue/ A monument to Adam Smith] Adam Smith Institute.

Stoddart's statue of [[James Clerk Maxwell]], a physicist, stands in George's Street in Edinburgh and a memorial to [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], a novelist, is on Corstorphine Road.<ref name='scotsman'/> His monument to [[John Witherspoon]] stands in Paisley, with a copy outside [[Princeton University]].

There are several pieces by Stoddart in Glasgow's [[Merchant City]] quarter. ''Italia'', a 2.6 metre, glass re-in-forced polymer statue on top of Ingram Street represents the contribution of Italian traders to the area. Classical in style, the female form is swathed in a [[chiton]] and carries symbols of ancient Italy: a palm branch in her right hand and an inverted cornucopia in her left.<ref> McKenzie (2001:215)</ref> On John Street, a trio of figures, ''Mercury'', ''Mercurius'' and ''Mercurial'' form a triangle. The first two, identical figures, sit above the John St. fa<U+00E7>ade of the Italian centre; their English and Roman names signify the two different manifestations of the deity in Roman mythology. Here, they embody a "dialogue" between ancient lore and modern city life. Opposite, on a plinth on the street, stands ''Mercurial'', cast in bronze and with the adjectival form of the name, it complements the duality of the other two with an underlying unity.<ref> McKenzie (2001:216)</ref>

Putative projects include a monument to [[Willie Gallacher]], the Paisley-born Communist MP, championed by [[Tony Benn]] and funded by a public appeal and "Oscar", an amphitheatre carved into the rock on the Scottish coast dedicated to [[Ossian]], the mythical Scot bard.<ref name='scotsman'/><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Morris Singer Art Founders |title =Adam Smith by Sandy Stoddart | url =http://www.msaf.co.uk/news-adamsmith.htm | accessdate = 2008-01-06 }}</ref>
