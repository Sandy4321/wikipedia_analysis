{{otherships|HMS Bellona}}

'''HMS ''Bellona''''' was one of two [[Boadicea class cruiser|''Boadicea''-class]] [[scout cruiser]]s built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the first decade of the 20th century. She led the [[2nd Destroyer Flotilla]] from completion until 1912. During World War I, she was assigned to [[battleship]] [[squadron (naval)|squadron]]s of the [[Grand Fleet]]. She was present at, but did not fight in, the [[Battle of Jutland]] in mid-1916. The ship was converted into a [[minelayer]] in mid-1917 and made four [[sortie]]s to lay her [[naval mine|mines]] before the end of the war. ''Bellona'' was [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in 1919 and sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1921.  

==Design and description==
Designed to provide [[destroyer]] [[flotilla]]s with a [[command ship]] capable of outclassing enemy destroyers with her six {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on|0|spell=in}} guns, ''Bellona'' proved too slow in service from the start of her career. Her {{convert|25|kn|adj=on|lk=in}} speed was barely capable of matching the speeds of the [[River class destroyer|''River''-class]] destroyers she led in her flotilla in 1909 and proved inadequate to match the speed of later destroyers.<ref name=gg0>Gardiner & Gray, p. 50</ref>

[[Displacement (ship)|Displacing]] {{convert|3350|LT|t}}, the ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|405|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|41|ft|6|in|m|1}} and a deep [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|14|ft|m|1}}. She was powered by four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s, each driving one shaft. The turbines produced a total of {{convert|18000|ihp|lk=in}}, using steam produced by 12 [[Yarrow boiler]]s, and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|25|kn}}. She carried a maximum of {{convert|780|LT|t}} of coal and {{convert|189|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]].<ref name=f5>Friedman 2009, p. 295</ref> Her crew consisted of 317 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=gg0/>

Her main armament consisted of six [[List of British ordnance terms#BL|breech-loading (BL)]] [[BL 4 inch naval gun Mk VII|four-inch Mk VII guns]]. The forward pair of guns were mounted side by side on a platform on the [[forecastle]], the middle pair were [[amidships]], one on each broadside, and the two remaining guns were on the centreline of the quarterdeck, one ahead of the other.<ref name=gg0/> The guns fired their {{convert|31|lb|adj=on}} shells to a range of about {{convert|11400|yd}}.<ref>Friedman 2011, pp. 75<U+2013>76</ref> Her secondary armament was four [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]] [[Ordnance QF 3-pounder Vickers|three-pounder ({{convert|47|mm|in|abbr=on}}) Vickers Mk I gun]]s and two submerged [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45 cm)]] [[torpedo tube]]s. During the war, four additional four-inch guns were added amidships to increase her firepower. A [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|QF three-inch 20 cwt]]<ref group=Note>"Cwt" is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 20 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.</ref> anti-aircraft gun was also added. In 1918 it was replaced by a four-inch gun.<ref name=gg0/>

As a scout cruiser, the ship was only lightly protected to maximize her speed. She had a curved protective [[deck (ship)|deck]] that was {{convert|1|in|mm|0|spell=in}} thick on the slope and {{convert|.5|in}} on the flat.<ref name=f5/> Her [[conning tower]] was protected by four inches of armour.<ref name=gg0/>

==Construction and service== 
''Bellona'', the sixth ship of that name,<ref name=c5/> was [[Keel|laid down]] at [[Pembroke Royal Dockyard]], on 5 June 1908 and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 20 March 1908. She was completed in February 1910 and became the leader of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla through 1912.<ref name=gg0/> She was assigned to the [[1st Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Battle Squadron]] of the Grand Fleet in [[Scapa Flow]] at the start of the war.<ref>Corbett, Vol. I, p. 439; Vol. II, pp. 412, 417</ref> ''Bellona'' was at the [[Battle of Jutland]] but was assigned to a position at the rear of the squadron and did not fire her guns.<ref>Corbett, Vol. III, p. 345</ref> She was converted to a [[minelayer]] in June 1917 and laid 306 mines in four missions.<ref name=gg0/> After the war she was in 1919 and sold for scrap on 9 May 1921 to [[Thomas William Ward (industrialist)|T. W. Ward]] at [[Lelant]].<ref name=c5>Colledge, p. 37</ref>
