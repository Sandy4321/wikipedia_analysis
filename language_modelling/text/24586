{{History of China|BCE=1}}
[[China|Chinese]] civilization originated in various city-states along the [[Yellow River]] valley in the [[Neolithic]] era. The written '''history of China''' begins with the  [[Shang Dynasty]] (ca. 1700 BCE &ndash; ca. 1046 BCE).<ref name="state1">{{cite web|url=http://exchanges.state.gov/culprop/cn04sum.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071215094418/http://exchanges.state.gov/culprop/cn04sum.html|archivedate=2007-12-15|title=Cultural History and Archaeology of China|publisher=Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, U.S. State Department|accessdate=2008-01-12}}{{Dead link|url=http://exchanges.state.gov/culprop/cn04sum.html|date=December 2008}}</ref> [[Oracle bone|Turtle shells]] with ancient [[Chinese writing]] from the Shang Dynasty have been [[carbon dated]] to as early as 1500 BCE.<ref>Henry Cleere.

The [[feudal]] Zhou Dynasty eventually broke apart into individual smaller states, beginning the [[Warring States period]]. In 221 BCE, [[Qin Shi Huang]] united the various warring kingdoms and created the first Chinese empire. Successive [[dynasties in Chinese history]] developed [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] systems that enabled the [[Emperor of China]] to directly control the vast territories.

The conventional view of Chinese history is that of a dynasty alternating between periods of political unity and disunity and occasionally becoming dominated by foreign Asian peoples, most of whom were assimilated into the [[Han Chinese]] population. Cultural and political influences from many parts of [[Asia]], carried by successive waves of [[immigration]], expansion, and [[cultural assimilation]], merged to create the modern [[culture of China]].

The early history of China is complicated by the lack of a written language during this period coupled with the existence of documents from later time periods attempting to describe events that occurred several centuries before. The problem in some sense stems from centuries of introspection on the part of the Chinese people which has blurred the distinction between fact and fiction in regards to this early history. By 7000 BCE, the Chinese were farming [[millet]], giving rise to the [[Jiahu]] culture. At [[Damaidi]] in [[Ningxia]], 3,172 [[Neolithic signs in China|cliff carvings]] dating to 6,000-5,000 BCE have been discovered "featuring 8,453 individual characters such as the sun, moon, stars, gods and scenes of hunting or grazing." These pictographs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written Chinese.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6669569.stm BBC NEWS | Asia-Pacific | Chinese writing '8,000 years old'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-05/18/content_6121225.htm|title=Carvings may rewrite history of Chinese characters|publisher=[[Xinhua]] online|date=2007-05-18|accessdate=2007-05-19}}</ref> Later [[Yangshao culture]] was superseded by the [[Longshan culture]] around 2500 BCE.

== Ancient era ==
=== Xia Dynasty (ca. 2,100-ca. 1,600 BCE) ===
{{Main|Xia Dynasty}}
{{See also|Xia Shang Zhou Chronology Project}}
The Xia Dynasty of China (from ca. 2,100 BCE to 1,600 BCE) is the first dynasty to be described in ancient historical records such as ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' and ''[[Bamboo Annals]]''.<ref name="state1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-chaos.umd.edu/history/ancient1.html|title=The Ancient Dynasties|publisher=University of Maryland|accessdate=2008-01-12}}</ref>

Although there is disagreement regarding the actual existence of the dynasty, there is some archaeological evidence pointing to its possible existence. The historian [[Sima Qian]] (145 BCE-90 BCE), who wrote the ''[[Shiji]]'' or ''Records of the Grand Historian'' and the so-called ''Bamboo Annals'' date the founding of the [[Xia Dynasty]] to 4,200 years ago, but this date has not been corroborated. Most archaeologists now connect the Xia to excavations at [[Erlitou culture|Erlitou]] in central [[Henan]] province,<ref>[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/chbro_bron.shtm Bronze Age China] at [http://www.nga.gov/ National Gallery of Art]</ref> where a bronze smelter from around 2000 BCE was unearthed. Early markings from this period found on pottery and shells are thought to be ancestors of modern Chinese characters.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20050213035644/http://www.gog.com.cn/gz/art0402/ca615230.htm Scripts found on Erlitou pottery] (written in [[Simplified Chinese]])</ref> With few clear records matching the Shang [[oracle bones]] or the [[Zhou Dynasty (1122 BCE - 256 BCE)|Zhou]] bronze vessel writings, the Xia era remains poorly understood.

=== Shang Dynasty (ca. 1700-1046 BCE) ===
{{Main|Shang Dynasty}}
[[Image:China 1.jpg|left|thumb|Remnants of advanced, stratified societies dating back to the Shang found in the Yellow River Valley]]
The earliest discovered written record of China's past dates from the Shang Dynasty in perhaps the 13th century BCE, and takes the form of inscriptions of divination records on the bones or shells of animals<U+2014>the so-called ''[[oracle bones]]''. Archeological findings providing evidence for the existence of the Shang Dynasty, c 1600-1046 BCE are divided into two sets. The first set, from the earlier Shang period (ca.1600-1300 BCE) comes from sources at [[Erligang culture|Erligang]], [[Zhengzhou]] and Shangcheng. The second set, from the later Shang or Yin (<U+6BB7>) period, consists of a large body of oracle bone writings. [[Anyang]], in modern-day [[Henan]], has been confirmed as the last of the Shang's nine capitals (c 1300-1046 BCE). The Shang Dynasty featured 31 kings, from [[Tang of Shang]] to [[King Zhou of Shang]]. In this period, the Chinese worshiped many different gods - weather gods and sky gods - and also a supreme god, named [[Shang-Ti]], who ruled over the other gods. Those who lived during the Shang Dynasty also believed that their ancestors - their parents and grandparents - became like gods when they died, and that their ancestors wanted to be worshipped too, like gods. Each family worshiped its own ancestors.

Around 1500 BCE, the Chinese began to use written oracle bones to predict the future. By the time of the Chou Dynasty (about 1100 BCE), the Chinese were also worshiping a natural force called t'ien, which is usually translated as Heaven. Like Shang-Ti, Heaven ruled over all the other gods, and it decided who would rule China, called the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. The ruler could rule as long as he or she had the Mandate of Heaven; it was believed that the emperor or empress had lost the Mandate of Heaven when natural disasters occurred in great number, and when, more realistically, the sovereign had apparently lost his concern for the people. In response, the royal house would be overthrown, and a new house would rule, having been granted the Mandate of Heaven.

The ''Records of the Grand Historian'' states that the Shang Dynasty moved its capital six times. The final (and most important) move to [[Yinxu|Yin]] in 1350 BCE led to the dynasty's golden age. The term Yin Dynasty has been synonymous with the Shang dynasty in history, although it has lately been used to specifically refer to the latter half of the Shang Dynasty.

Chinese historians living in later periods were accustomed to the notion of one dynasty succeeding another, but the actual political situation in early China is known to have been much more complicated. Hence, as some scholars of China suggest, the Xia and the Shang can possibly refer to political entities that existed concurrently, just as the early Zhou is known to have existed at the same time as the Shang.

Written records found at Anyang confirm the existence of the Shang dynasty. However, Western scholars are often hesitant to associate settlements contemporaneous with the Anyang settlement with the Shang dynasty. For example, archaeological findings at [[Sanxingdui]] suggest a technologically advanced civilization culturally unlike Anyang. The evidence is inconclusive in proving how far the Shang realm extended from Anyang. The leading hypothesis is that Anyang, ruled by the same Shang in the official history, coexisted and traded with numerous other culturally diverse settlements in the area that is now referred to as China proper.

=== Zhou Dynasty (1066-ca. 221 BCE) ===
[[Image:You with zigzag thunder pattern.jpg|thumb|[[Chinese bronzes|Bronze]] ritual vessel ([[You (vessel)|You]]), Western Zhou Dynasty]]
{{Main|Zhou Dynasty}}
The Zhou Dynasty was the longest dynasty in Chinese history, from 1066 to approximately 221 BCE. By the end of the 2nd millennium BCE, the [[Zhou Dynasty]] began to emerge in the [[Yellow River]] valley, overrunning the Shang. The Zhou appeared to have begun their rule under a semi-feudal system. The Zhou were a people who lived west of [[Shang]], and the Zhou leader had been appointed "Western Protector" by the Shang. The ruler of the Zhou, [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]], with the assistance of his brother, the [[Duke of Zhou]], as regent managed to defeat the Shang at the [[Battle of Muye]]. The king of Zhou at this time invoked the concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] to legitimize his rule, a concept that would be influential for almost every successive dynasty. The Zhou initially moved their capital west to an area near modern [[Xi'an]], near the Yellow River, but they would preside over a series of expansions into the [[Yangtze River]] valley. This would be the first of many population migrations from north to south in Chinese history.

=== Spring and Autumn Period (722-481 BCE) ===
{{Main|Spring and Autumn Period}}
[[Image:Pu with openwork interlaced dragons design.jpg|thumb|Chinese pu vessel with interlaced [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] design, [[Spring and Autumn Period]].]]
In the 8th century BCE, power became decentralized during the [[Spring and Autumn Period]], named after the influential [[Spring and Autumn Annals]]. In this period, local military leaders used by the Zhou began to assert their power and vie for [[hegemony]]. The situation was aggravated by the invasion of other peoples from the northwest, such as the Qin, forcing the Zhou to move their capital east to [[Luoyang]]. This marks the second large phase of the Zhou dynasty: the Eastern Zhou. In each of the hundreds of states that eventually arose, local strongmen held most of the political power and continued their subservience to the Zhou kings in name only. Local leaders for instance started using royal titles for themselves. The [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] of Chinese philosophy blossomed during this period, and such influential intellectual movements as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] and [[Mohism]] were founded, partly in response to the changing political world.
The Spring and Autumn Period is marked by a falling apart of the central Zhou power. China now consists of hundreds of states, some only as large as a village with a fort.

=== Warring States Period (476-221 BCE) ===
{{Main|Warring States Period}}
After further political consolidation, seven prominent states remained by the end of 5th century BCE, and the years in which these few states battled each other are known as the [[Warring States Period]]. Though there remained a nominal [[Zhou Dynasty (1122 BCE - 256 BCE)|Zhou]] king until 256 BCE, he was largely a figurehead and held little real power.
As neighboring territories of these warring states, including areas of modern [[Sichuan]] and [[Liaoning]], were annexed, they were governed under the new local administrative system of [[commandery]] and [[prefecture]] (<U+90E1><U+7E23>/<U+90E1><U+53BF>). This system had been in use since the Spring and Autumn Period and parts can still be seen in the modern system of [[Political divisions of China|Sheng & Xian]] (province and county, <U+7701><U+7E23>/<U+7701><U+53BF>). The final expansion in this period began during the reign of [[Ying Zheng]], the king of Qin. His unification of the other six powers, and further annexations in the modern regions of [[Zhejiang]], [[Fujian]], [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] in 214 BCE enabled him to proclaim himself the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]] (Qin Shi Huang).

== Imperial era ==
=== Qin Dynasty (221-206 BCE) ===
[[File:QinshihuangBW.jpg|thumb|[[Qin Shi Huang]]]]
{{Main|Qin Dynasty}}
Historians often refer to the period from [[Qin Dynasty]] to the end of [[Qing Dynasty]] as Imperial China. Though the unified reign of the [[Qin Shi Huang|Qin]] Emperor lasted only 12 years, he managed to subdue great parts of what constitutes the core of the [[Han Chinese]] homeland and to unite them under a tightly centralized [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalist]] government seated at [[Xianyang]] (close to modern [[Xi'an]]). The doctrine of legalism that guided the Qin emphasized strict adherence to a legal code and the absolute power of the emperor. This philosophy of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], while effective for expanding the empire in a military fashion, proved unworkable for governing it in peace time. The Qin presided over the brutal silencing of political opposition, including the event known as the [[To burn the classics and to bury the scholars|burning and burying of scholars]]. This would be the impetus behind the later Han Synthesis incorporating the more moderate schools of political governance.

[[Image:Terracotta Army-China2.jpg|thumb|The [[Terracotta Army]] of [[Qin Shi Huang]].]]
The [[Qin Dynasty]] is well known for beginning the [[Great Wall of China]], which was later augmented and enhanced during the [[Ming Dynasty]]. The other major contributions of the Qin include the concept of a centralized government, the unification of the legal code, written language, measurement, and currency of China after the tribulations of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States Periods. Even something as basic as the length of axles for carts
had to be made uniform to ensure a viable trading system throughout the empire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uobuy.com/upload/2005/9/19/200591911278032621125.jpg|title=Book "QINSHIHUANG"|accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref>

=== Han Dynasty (202 BCE&ndash;220 CE) ===
{{Main|Han Dynasty}}
{{See|History of the Han Dynasty}}
[[Image:ChangXingongdeng.jpg|thumb|A [[Han Dynasty]] [[oil lamp]] with a sliding shutter, in the shape of a kneeling female servant, 2nd century BCE]]
The [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BCE &ndash; 220 CE) emerged in 206 BCE, with its founder [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]] proclaimed emperor in 202. [[History of the Han Dynasty#Reign of Wu|It was the first dynasty]] to embrace the philosophy of [[Confucianism]], which became the ideological underpinning of all regimes until the end of imperial China. Under the Han Dynasty, China made great advances in many areas of the arts and sciences. [[Emperor Wu of Han China|Emperor Wu]] consolidated and extended the Chinese empire by pushing back the [[Xiongnu]] (identified with the [[Huns]]) into the steppes of modern [[Inner Mongolia]], wresting from them the modern areas of [[Gansu]], [[Ningxia]] and [[Qinghai]]. This enabled the first opening of trading connections between China and the West, the [[Silk Road]]. Han Dynasty general [[Ban Chao]] expanded his conquests across the [[Pamirs]] to the shores of the [[Caspian Sea]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/440601/Ban-Chao Ban Chao], Britannica Online Encyclopedia</ref> The first of several [[Roman embassies to China]] is recorded in Chinese sources, coming from the sea route in 166, and a second one in 284.

Nevertheless, land acquisitions by elite families gradually drained the tax base. In [[9|CE 9]], the usurper [[Wang Mang]] founded the short-lived [[Xin Dynasty|Xin ("New") Dynasty]] and started an extensive program of land and other economic reforms. These programs, however, were never supported by the land-holding families, for they favored the peasants. The instability brought about chaos and uprisings.

[[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Emperor Guangwu]] reinstated the Han Dynasty with the support of land-holding and merchant families at [[Luoyang]], east of [[Xi'an]]. This new era would be termed the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]]. Han power declined again amidst land acquisitions, invasions, and feuding between [[consort clan]]s and [[Eunuch (court official)#China|eunuch]]s. The [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out in 184, ushering in an era of [[warlord]]s. In the ensuing turmoil, three states tried to gain predominance in the Period of the [[Three Kingdoms]]. This time period has been greatly romanticized in works such as ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]''.

===Wei and Jin Period (265&ndash;420 CE)===
{{Main|Cao Wei|Jin Dynasty (265-420)}}
After Cao Cao reunified the North in 208CE, his son proclaimed the Wei dynasty in 220CE. Soon, Wei's rivals Shu and Wu proclaimed their independence, leading China into the Three Kingdoms Period. This period was characterized by a gradual decentralization of the state that had existed during the Qin and Han Dynasties, and an increase in the power of great families. Although the Three Kingdoms were reunified by the Jin Dynasty in 280 CE, this structure was essentially the same until the Wu Hu uprising.

=== Wu Hu Period  (304&ndash;439 CE)===
{{Main|Sixteen Kingdoms|Wu Hu uprising}}
Taking advantage of civil war in the Jin Dynasty, the contemporary non-Han Chinese ([[Wu Hu]]) ethnic groups controlled much of the country in the early 4th century and provoked large-scale Han Chinese migrations to south of the [[Yangtze River|Chang Jiang]]. In 303 the [[Di (ethnic group)|Di]] people rebelled and later captured [[Chengdu]], establishing the state of [[Cheng Han]]. Under [[Liu Yuan (Han Zhao)|Liu Yuan]] the [[Xiongnu]] rebelled near today's [[Linfen County]] and established the state of [[Han Zhao]]. His successor [[Liu Cong (Han Zhao)|Liu Cong]] captured and [[execution (legal)|executed]] the last two Western Jin emperors. [[Sixteen Kingdoms|Sixteen kingdoms]] were a plethora of short-lived non-Chinese dynasties that came to rule the whole or parts of northern China in the 4th and 5th centuries. Many ethnic groups were involved, including ancestors of the [[Turkic people|Turks]], [[Mongols|Mongolians]], and [[Tibetans]]. Most of these [[nomadic]] peoples had to some extent been "Sinicized" long before their ascent to power. In fact, some of them, notably the Ch'iang and the Xiong-nu, had already been allowed to live in the frontier regions within the Great Wall since late Han times.

[[Image:Chinese Boddhisattva statue.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[limestone]] statue of the [[Bodhisattva]], from the [[Northern Qi|Northern Qi Dynasty]], 570 AD, made in what is now modern [[Henan]] province.]]

=== Southern and Northern Dynasties (420&ndash;589 CE) ===
{{Main|Southern and Northern Dynasties}}
Signaled by the collapse of [[East Jin Dynasty]] in 420, China entered the era of the Southern and Northern Dynasties. The Han people managed to survive the military attacks from the nomadic tribes of the north, such as the [[Xianbei|Xian Bei]], and their civilization continued to thrive.

In Southern China, fierce debates about whether [[Buddhism]] should be allowed to exist were held frequently by the royal court and nobles. Finally, near the end of the Southern and Northern Dynasties era, both Buddhist and [[Taoist]] followers compromised and became more tolerant of each other.

In 589, Sui annexed the last Southern Dynasty, Chen, through military force, and put an end to the era of Southern and Northern Dynasties.

=== Sui Dynasty (589&ndash;618 CE) ===
{{Main|Sui Dynasty}}
The [[Sui Dynasty]], which managed to reunite the country in 589 after nearly four centuries of political fragmentation, played a role more important than its length of existence would suggest. The Sui brought China together again and set up many institutions that were to be adopted by their successors, the Tang. Like the Qin, however, the Sui overused their resources and collapsed. Also similar to the Qin, traditional history has judged the Sui somewhat unfairly, as it has stressed the harshness of the Sui regime and the arrogance of its second emperor, giving little credit for the Dynasty's many positive achievements.

=== Tang Dynasty (618&ndash;907 CE) ===
[[Image:Tang horse.jpg|thumb|A Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] tri-colored [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]] porcelain horse (ca. 700 CE)]]
{{Main|Tang Dynasty}}
On June 18, 618, [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang China|Gaozu]] took the throne, and the [[Tang Dynasty]] was established, opening a new age of prosperity and innovations in arts and technology. [[Buddhism]], which had gradually been established in China from the [[1st century|first century]], became the predominant religion and was adopted by the imperial family and many of the common people.

[[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]), the national capital, is thought to have been the world's largest city at the time. The Tang and the Han are often referred to as the most prosperous periods of Chinese history.

The Tang, like the Han, kept the trade routes open to the west and south and there was extensive trade with distant foreign countries and many foreign merchants settled in China.

The Tang introduced a new system into the Chinese government, called the "[[equal-field system]]". This system gave families land grants from the Emperor based on their needs, not their wealth.

From about 860 the Tang Dynasty began to decline due to a series of rebellions within China itself, and in the previously subject Kingdom of [[Nanzhao]] to the south. One of the warlords, [[Huang Chao]], captured [[Guangzhou]] in 879, killing most of the 200,000 inhabitants including most of the large colony of foreign merchant families there.<ref>[http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/judaism/kaifung.html Kaifung Jews]. University of Cumbria.</ref> In late 880 Luoyang surrendered to him and on 5 January, 881 he conquered [[Chang'an]]. The emperor [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Xizong]] fled to [[Chengdu]] and Huang established a new temporary regime, which was eventually destroyed by Tang forces, but another time of political chaos followed.

=== Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms (907&ndash;960 CE) ===
{{Main|Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period}}
The period of political disunity between the Tang and the Song, known as the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period]], lasted little more than half a century, from 907 to 960. During this brief era, when China was in all respects a multi-state system, five regimes succeeded one another rapidly in control of the old Imperial heartland in northern China. During this same time, 10 more stable regimes occupied sections of southern and western China, so the period is also referred to as that of the Ten Kingdoms.

=== Song Dynasty and Liao, Jin, Western Xia (960&ndash;1234 CE) ===
[[Image:Li Di, Homeward Oxherds in Wind and Rain.jpg|thumb|''Homeward Oxherds in Wind and Rain'', by Li Di, 12th century]]
{{Main|Song Dynasty|Liao Dynasty|Western Xia|Jin Dynasty, 1115-1234}}
{{See|History of the Song Dynasty}}
In 960, the [[Song Dynasty|Song Dynasty (960-1279)]] gained power over most of China and established its capital in [[Kaifeng]] (later known as [[Bianjing]]), starting a period of economic prosperity, while the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao Dynasty]] ruled over [[Manchuria]], present-day [[Mongolia]], and parts of [[North China|Northern China]]. In 1115 the [[Jin Dynasty (1115<U+2013>1234)|Jurchen Jin Dynasty (1115-1234)]] emerged to prominence, annihilating the Liao Dynasty in 10 years. Meanwhile, in what are now the northwestern Chinese provinces of [[Gansu]], [[Shaanxi]], and [[Ningxia]], there emerged a [[Western Xia|Western Xia Dynasty]] from 1032 up to 1227, established by [[Tangut]] tribes.

The Jin Dynasty also took power over northern China and Kaifeng from the Song Dynasty, which moved its capital to [[Hangzhou]] (<U+676D><U+5DDE>). The Southern Song Dynasty also suffered the humiliation of having to acknowledge the Jin Dynasty as formal overlords. In the ensuing years China was divided between the Song Dynasty, the Jin Dynasty and the [[Tangut]] [[Western Xia]]. Southern Song experienced a period of great technological development which can be explained in part by the military pressure that it felt from the north. This included the use of [[gunpowder]] weapons, which played a large role in the Song Dynasty naval victories against the Jin in the [[Battle of Tangdao]] and [[Battle of Caishi]] on the Yangtze River in 1161. Furthermore, China's first permanent standing [[navy]] was assembled and provided an [[admiral]]'s office at [[Dinghai]] in 1132, under the reign of [[Emperor Renzong of Song]].

The Song Dynasty is considered by many to be classical China's high point in science and technology, with innovative [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-officials]] such as [[Su Song]] (1020<U+2013>1101) and [[Shen Kuo]] (1031<U+2013>1095). There was court intrigue with the political rivals of the Reformers and Conservatives, led by the chancellors [[Wang Anshi]] and [[Sima Guang]], respectively. By the mid to late 13th century the Chinese had adopted the dogma of [[Neo-Confucian]] philosophy formulated by [[Zhu Xi]]. There were enormous literary works compiled during the Song Dynasty, such as the historical work of the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]''. Culture and the arts flourished, with grandiose artworks such as ''[[Along the River During Qingming Festival]]'' and ''[[Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute]]'', while there were great Buddhist painters such as [[Lin Tinggui]].

[[Jurchen people|Jurchen tribes']] [[Jin Dynasty, 1115<U+2013>1234|Jin Dynasty]], whose names are also rendered "Jin" in pinyin, was defeated by the [[Mongol]]s, who then proceeded to defeat the Southern Song in a long and bloody war, the first war where firearms played an important role. During the era after the war, later called the ''[[Pax Mongolica]]'', adventurous Westerners such as [[Marco Polo]] travelled all the way to China and brought the first reports of its wonders to Europe. In the Yuan Dynasty, the Mongols were divided between those who wanted to remain based in the steppes and those who wished to adopt the customs of the Chinese.

[[Kublai Khan]], grandson of [[Genghis Khan]], wanting to adopt the customs of China, established the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. This was the first dynasty to rule the whole of China from [[Beijing]] as the capital. Beijing had been ceded to Liao in CE 938 with the [[Sixteen Prefectures|Sixteen Prefectures of Yan Yun]]. Before that, it had been the capital of the [[Jin Dynasty, 1115<U+2013>1234|Jin]], who did not rule all of China.

Before the [[Timeline of Mongol conquests|Mongol invasion]], Chinese dynasties reportedly had approximately 120 million inhabitants; after the conquest was completed in 1279, the 1300 census reported roughly 60 million people.<ref>Ping-ti Ho, "An Estimate of the Total Population of Sung-Chin China", in ''<U+00C9>tudes Song'', Series 1, No 1, (1970) pp. 33-53.</ref> The 14th century epidemics of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] ([[Black Death]]) is estimated to have killed 30% of the population of China.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://web.archive.org/web/20071118121009/http://chip.med.nyu.edu/course/view.php?id=13&topic=1|title = Course: Plague}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Black_Death_-_Consequences/id/617544|title = Black Death - Consequences}}</ref>

=== Ming Dynasty (1368&ndash;1644 CE) ===

[[File:Hongwu1.jpg|left|thumb|[[Hongwu Emperor]], founder of [[Ming Dynasty]]]]
Throughout the Yuan Dynasty, which lasted less than a century, there was relatively strong sentiment among the populace against the Mongol rule. The frequent natural disasters since the 1340s finally led to peasant revolts. The Yuan Dynasty was eventually overthrown by the [[Ming Dynasty]] in 1368.

Urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex. Large urban centers, such as [[Nanjing]] and [[Beijing]], also contributed to the growth of private industry. In particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however, relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil.

Despite the [[xenophobia]] and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of [[neo-Confucianism]], China under the early Ming Dynasty was not isolated. Foreign trade and other contacts with the outside world, particularly [[Japan]], increased considerably. Chinese merchants explored all of the [[Indian Ocean]], reaching [[East Africa]] with the voyages of [[Zheng He]].

[[Zhu Yuanzhang]] or ([[Hongwu Emperor of China|Hong-wu]], the founder of the dynasty, laid the foundations for a state interested less in commerce and more in extracting revenues from the agricultural sector. Perhaps because of the Emperor's background as a peasant, the Ming economic system emphasized agriculture, unlike that of the Song and the Mongolian Dynasties, which relied on traders and merchants for revenue. Neo-feudal landholdings of the Song and Mongol periods were expropriated by the Ming rulers. Land estates were confiscated by the government, fragmented, and rented out. Private slavery was forbidden. Consequently, after the death of [[Yongle Emperor of China|Emperor Yong-le]], independent peasant landholders predominated in Chinese agriculture. These laws might have paved the way to removing the worst of the poverty during the previous regimes.

[[Image:Ming-Empire2.jpg|left|thumb|Ming China under the reign of the [[Yongle Emperor]]]]
The dynasty had a strong and complex central government that unified and controlled the empire. The emperor's role became more autocratic, although Zhu Yuanzhang necessarily continued to use what he called the "Grand Secretaries" (<U+5185><U+9601>) to assist with the immense paperwork of the bureaucracy, including memorials (petitions and recommendations to the throne), imperial edicts in reply, reports of various kinds, and tax records. It was this same bureaucracy that later prevented the Ming government from being able to adapt to changes in society, and eventually led to its decline.

Emperor Yong-le strenuously tried to extend China's influence beyond its borders by demanding other rulers send ambassadors to China to present tribute. A large navy was built, including four-masted ships displacing 1,500&nbsp;tons. A standing army of 1 million troops (some estimate as many as 1.9 million {{Who|date=March 2009}}) was created. The Chinese armies [[L<U+00EA> L<U+1EE3>i|conquered Vietnam]] for around 20 years, while the Chinese fleet sailed the China seas and the Indian Ocean, cruising as far as the east coast of Africa. The Chinese gained influence in [[Eastern Turkestan]]. Several maritime Asian nations sent envoys with tribute for the Chinese emperor. Domestically, the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] was expanded, and proved to be a stimulus to domestic trade. Over 100,000&nbsp;tons of iron per year were produced. Many books were printed using movable type. The imperial palace in Beijing's [[Forbidden City]] reached its current splendor. It was also during these centuries that the potential of south China came to be fully exploited. New crops were widely cultivated and industries such as those producing porcelain and textiles flourished.

In 1449 [[Esen Tayisi]] led an [[Oirats|Oirat]] Mongol invasion of northern China which culminated in the capture of the [[Zhengtong Emperor]] at [[Battle of Tumu Fortress|Tumu]]. In 1542 the Mongol leader [[Altan Khan]] began to harass China along the northern border. In 1550 he even reached the suburbs of Beijing. The empire also had to deal with [[Wokou|Japanese pirates]] attacking the southeastern coastline;<ref>"China > History > The Ming dynasty > Political history > The dynastic succession", ''Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online'', 2007</ref> General [[Qi Jiguang]] was instrumental in defeating these pirates. The deadliest earthquake of all times, the [[1556 Shaanxi earthquake|Shaanxi earthquake]] of 1556 that killed approximately 830,000 people, occurred during the [[Jiajing Emperor]]'s reign.

During the Ming dynasty the last construction on the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] was undertaken to protect China from foreign invasions. While the Great Wall had been built in earlier times, most of what is seen today was either built or repaired by the Ming. The brick and granite work was enlarged, the watch towers were redesigned, and cannons were placed along its length.

=== Qing Dynasty (1644&ndash;1911 CE)===
[[Image:The Reception.JPG|thumb|left|"The reception of the Diplomatique ([[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Macartney]]) and his suite, at the Court of Pekin". Drawn and engraved by [[James Gillray]], published in September 1792.]]
[[Image:Qing china.jpg|thumb|300px|Territory of [[Qing Dynasty|Qing China]] in 1892]]
{{Main|Qing Dynasty}}
The [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644&ndash;1911) was founded after the defeat of the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]], the last [[Han Chinese]] [[dynasty]], by the [[Manchus]]. The Manchus were formerly known as the ''[[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]''. When Beijing was captured by [[Li Zicheng]]'s peasant rebels in 1644, the last Ming Emperor [[Chongzhen]] committed suicide. The Manchu then allied with Ming Dynasty general [[Wu Sangui]] and seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty. The Manchus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule of [[China proper]].

The Manchus enforced a 'queue order' forcing the Han Chinese to adopt the Manchu [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue hairstyle]] and Manchu-style clothing. The traditional Chinese clothing, or [[Hanfu]] was also replaced by Manchu-style clothing. [[Qipao]] (bannermen dress and ''[[Tangzhuang]]''). The penalty for not complying was death.

[[Kangxi Emperor of China|Emperor Kangxi]] ordered the creation of [[Kangxi Dictionary|the most complete dictionary]] of [[Chinese character]]s ever put together at the time. The Manchus set up the "[[Eight Banners]]" system in an attempt to avoid being assimilated into Chinese society. The "Eight Banners" were military institutions set up to provide a structure with which the Manchu "bannermen" were meant to identify. Banner membership was to be based on traditional Manchu skills such as archery, horsemanship, and frugality. In addition, they were encouraged to use the Manchu language, rather than Chinese, though this had been changed significantly in the later course of the dynasty. Bannermen were given economic and legal privileges in Chinese cities.

Over the next half-century, the Qing consolidated control of some areas originally under the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]], including [[Yunnan]]. They also stretched their sphere of influence over [[Xinjiang]], [[Tibet]] and [[Mongolia]]. But during the nineteenth century, [[Qing]] control weakened. Britain's desire to continue its opium trade with China collided with imperial edicts prohibiting the addictive drug, and the [[First Opium War]] erupted in 1840. [[Hong Kong]] was ceded to Britain in 1842 under the [[Treaty of Nanking]].

A large [[List of revolutions and rebellions|rebellion]], the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1851<U+2013>1864), involved around a third of China falling under control of the Taiping Tianguo, a quasi-Christian religious movement led by the "Heavenly King" [[Hong Xiuquan]]. Only after fourteen years were the Taipings finally crushed - the Taiping army was destroyed in the [[Third Battle of Nanking]] in 1864. The death toll during the 15 years of the rebellion was about 20 million.<ref name="Userserols">Userserols. "[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/wars19c.htm Userserols]." ''Statistics of Wars, Oppressions and Atrocities of the Nineteenth Century.'' Retrieved on 2007-04-11.</ref>

In addition, more costly rebellions in terms of human lives and economics followed with the [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]], [[Nien Rebellion]], [[Dungan revolt|Muslim Rebellion]], [[Panthay Rebellion]] and the [[Boxer Rebellion]].<ref>Damsan Harper, Steve Fallon, Katja Gaskell, Julie Grundvig, Carolyn Heller, Thomas Huhti, Bradley Maynew, Christopher Pitts. Lonely Planet China. 9. 2005. ISBN 1-74059-687-0</ref> In many ways, the rebellions and the [[unequal treaties]] the Qing were forced to sign with the imperialist powers are symptomatic of the Qing's inability to deal with the new challenges of the 19th century.

[[Image:The Portrait of the Qing Dynasty Cixi Imperial Dowager Empress of China in the 1900s.PNG|thumb|right|The [[Empress Dowager Cixi]]]]
By the 1860s, the [[Qing]] Dynasty had put down the rebellions at enormous cost and loss of life. This undermined the credibility of the Qing regime and, spearheaded by local initiatives by provincial leaders and gentry, contributed to the rise of warlordism in China. The Qing Dynasty under the [[Emperor Guangxu]] proceeded to deal with the problem of modernization through the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]]. However, between 1898 and 1908 the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] had the reformist Guangxu imprisoned for being 'mentally disabled'{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. The Empress Dowager, with the help of conservatives, initiated a military coup, effectively removed the young Emperor from power, and overturned most of the more radical reforms. He died one day before the death of the Empress Dowager (some believe Guangxu was poisoned by Cixi). Official corruption, cynicism, and imperial family quarrels made most of the military reforms useless. As a result, the Qing's "[[New Armies]]" were soundly defeated in the [[Sino-French War (1883-1885)]] and the [[Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895)]].

At the start of the 20th century, the [[Boxer Rebellion]] threatened northern China. This was a conservative anti-imperialist movement that sought to return China to old ways. The Empress Dowager, probably seeking to ensure her continued grip on power, sided with the Boxers when they advanced on Beijing. In response, a [[China Relief Expedition|relief expedition]] of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] invaded China to rescue the besieged foreign missions. Consisting of British, Japanese, Russian, Italian, German, French, US and Austrian troops, the alliance defeated the Boxers and demanded further concessions from the Qing government.

== Modern era ==
=== Republic of China ===
{{Main|History of the Republic of China}}

Frustrated by the Qing court's resistance to reform and by China's weakness, young officials, military officers, and students&mdash;inspired by the revolutionary ideas of [[Sun Yat-sen]] &mdash;began to advocate the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the creation of a republic.

[[File:Sunyatsen1.jpg|thumb|[[Sun Yat-sen]], founder and first president of the Republic of China.]]
[[Slavery]] in China was abolished in 1910.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://web.archive.org/web/20071114095017/http://www.uclan.ac.uk/facs/class/cfe/ceth/abolition/history.htm|title = Commemoration of the Abolition of Slavery Project}}</ref>

A revolutionary military uprising, the [[Wuchang Uprising]], began on October 10, 1911 in [[Wuhan]]. The provisional government of the [[Republic of China]] was formed in [[Nanjing]] on March 12, 1912 with [[Sun Yat-sen]] as [[President of the Republic of China|President]], but Sun was forced to turn power over to [[Yuan Shikai]], who commanded the [[New Army]] and was [[Prime Minister]] under the Qing government, as part of the agreement to let the [[Ai-xin-jue-luo Pu-yi|last Qing monarch]] abdicate (a decision Sun would later regret). Over the next few years, Yuan proceeded to abolish the national and provincial assemblies, and declared himself emperor in late 1915. Yuan's imperial ambitions were fiercely opposed by his subordinates; faced with the prospect of rebellion, he abdicated in March 1916, and died in June of that year. His death left a power vacuum in China; the republican government was all but shattered. This ushered in the [[warlord era]], during which much of the country was ruled by shifting coalitions of competing provincial military leaders.

In 1919, the [[May Fourth Movement]] began as a response to the terms imposed on China by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] ending [[World War I]], but quickly became a protest movement about the domestic situation in China. The discrediting of liberal Western philosophy amongst Chinese intellectuals was followed by the adoption of more radical lines of thought. This in turn planted the seeds for the irreconcilable conflict between the left and right in China that would dominate Chinese history for the rest of the century.

In the 1920s, [[Sun Yat-Sen]] established a revolutionary base in south China, and set out to unite the fragmented nation. With Soviet assistance, he entered into an alliance with the fledgling [[Communist Party of China]]. After Sun's death from cancer in 1925, one of his prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>s, [[Chiang Kai-shek]], seized control of the [[Kuomintang|''Kuomintang'' (Nationalist Party or KMT)]] and succeeded in bringing most of south and central China under its rule in a military campaign known as the [[Northern Expedition (1926<U+2013>1927)|Northern Expedition]]. Having defeated the warlords in south and central China by military force, Chiang was able to secure the nominal allegiance of the warlords in the North. In 1927, Chiang turned on the CPC and relentlessly chased the CPC armies and its leaders from their bases in southern and eastern China. In 1934, driven from their mountain bases such as the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]], the CPC forces embarked on the [[Long March]] across China's most desolate terrain to the northwest, where they established a guerrilla base at [[Yan'an]] in [[Shaanxi]] Province.

During the [[Long March]], the communists reorganized under a new leader, [[Mao Zedong]] (Mao Tse-tung). The bitter struggle between the KMT and the CPC continued, openly or clandestinely, through the 14-year long Japanese occupation (1931<U+2013>1945), of various parts of the country. The two Chinese parties nominally formed a united front to oppose the Japanese in 1937, during the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)]], which became a part of [[World War II]]. Following the defeat of Japan in 1945, the war between the KMT and the CPC resumed, after failed attempts at reconciliation and a negotiated settlement. By 1949, the CPC had occupied most of the country. ''(see [[Chinese Civil War]])''

At the end of WWII in 1945 as part of the overall Japanese surrender, Japanese troops in Taiwan surrendered to Republic of China troops giving Chiang Kai-shek effective control of Taiwan.<ref>[http://www.taiwandocuments.org/ghq.htm Surrender Order of the Imperial General Headquarters of Japan], 2 September 1945, "(a) The senior Japanese commanders and all ground, sea, air, and auxiliary forces within China (excluding Manchuria), [[Formosa]], and [[French Indochina]] north of 16 degrees north latitude shall surrender to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek."</ref> When Chiang was defeated by CPC forces in mainland China in 1949, he fled to [[Taiwan]] with his government and the remnants of his army, along with most of the KMT leadership and a large number of their supporters.

===1949 to Present===
{{See also|People's Republic of China|Republic of China|Legal status of Taiwan|Political status of Taiwan}}
With the CPC's victory, and their proclamation of the [[People's Republic of China]] on October 1, 1949, Taiwan was again politically separated from mainland China, and continues to be governed by the [[Republic of China]] to the present day. No peace treaty has ever been signed between the two opposing parties.
