Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station.<ref name=raw>{{Cite news | title = Cambridge bow to raw power | work = [[The Times]] | date = 1 April 1991 | page = 23 | issue = 63980 | first = Mike |last = Rosewell}}</ref>  Rating higher, Cambridge took an early lead under the guidance of experienced stroke Adam Wright, and were almost a length up after two-and-a-half minutes.  By the Mile Post, the lead was just a second and the long bend around [[Harrods Furniture Depository]], afforded Oxford the advantage, and by [[Hammersmith Bridge]] the Dark Blues were over two seconds ahead. Extending their lead to seven seconds by Chiswick Steps, Oxford took control of the race and passed under [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]] with a twelve-second advantage.  Oxford passed the finishing post in a time of 16 minutes 59 seconds, the third-fastest time in the history of the Boat Race, winning their 18th race in 23 years.<ref name=arr>{{Cite news | title = Oxford's triumph sullied by their arrogance | first = David | last = Miller | work = [[The Times]] | date = 1 April 1991 | page = 19 | issue = 63980}}</ref>  The Beefeater Gin Trophy was presented to the victorious Oxford Boat Club president Obholzer by the [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Royal]].<ref name=arr/>

==Reaction==
Oxford's finishing coach was surprised that Cambridge made such a good start, while his counterpart, [[Stephen Peel]], had hoped that his crew would "rattle Oxford by breaking contact".<ref name=raw/> Winning head coach Stephen Royle praised his stroke, Obholzer: "Rupert was brilliant.  He took the race by the scruff of the neck."<ref name=raw/>  Despite Michels shouting "see you at the finish" as his boat pulled away from Cambridge, and a celebration considered "street-gang-style prancing" by the Oxford crew,<ref name=arr/> Michels explained: "without Cambridge, there is no race.  The beauty of the event is the personal conflict, and that is what it brings out in the crowds."<ref name=arr/>
