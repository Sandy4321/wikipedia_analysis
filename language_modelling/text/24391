[[Image:MimiPollak.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mimi Pollak, 1920s]]'''Mimi Pollak''', ''Maria Helena Pollak'', ([[9 April]] [[1903]] &ndash; [[11 August]] [[1999]]) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[actor|actress]] and [[theatre]] [[Theatre director|director]].

== Mini biography ==
Actress Mimi Pollak was born in [[Hammar<U+00F6> Municipality|Hammar<U+00F6>]], [[V<U+00E4>rmland]] of [[Austria|Austrian]] parents of [[Jewish]] descent and was trained in the performing arts at the prestigious [[Dramatens elevskola]]  (the Royal Dramatic Theatre's acting school) in [[Stockholm]] 1922-24.

In 1948 Pollak became the first contracted female director at the Royal Dramatic Theatre (aka [[Dramaten]]) with the production of [[Jean Genet]]'s ''Jungfruleken'' (Les Bonnes/The Maids), starring [[Anita Bj<U+00F6>rk]] and [[Maj-Britt Nilsson]] in the leads. Pollak became a very successful director at Dramaten and staged altogether 60 plays at the national stage over the years. Pollak worked first mainly as an actress at Dramaten (in the 1920s-50s) and then primarily as director 1950s-70s.

She also appeared in about 30 film and TV productions. Notable film roles are her supporting parts in [[Schamyl Bauman]]'s film comedy ''Skolka skolan'' in 1949, in [[Vilgot Sj<U+00F6>man]]'s ''Kl<U+00E4>nningen'' (aka ''The Dress'') in 1964, in [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[Autumn Sonata]]'' (starring [[Ingrid Bergman]]) as the piano teacher, in the 1982 film ''[[Flight of the Eagle]]'' (starring [[Max von Sydow]]) directed by [[Jan Troell]] and in the very popular Swedish TV mystery ''Agnes Cecilia - en s<U+00E4>llsam historia'' (1991), adapted from the successful books by [[Maria Gripe]].

Pollak was for some years married to Swedish actor Nils Lundell. 

Sometimes credited as ''Mimmi Pollak'', ''Mimi Pollack'' or ''Mimmi Pollack''.

== Personal life ==
Pollak attended drama school in [[Stockholm, Sweden]] with fellow actress [[Greta Garbo]] 1922-24. The two became involved in an affair. Circumstances did not allow the two to continue the relationship, as Pollak married and later had children, although they did maintain contact for over 60 years. Garbo would go on to become involved with several other [[Hollywood]] actresses, though keeping her [[bisexuality]] a secret. As recorded in the personal writings of Garbo, released in [[Sweden]] in 2005, Garbo remained in love with Pollak until her death in 1990. <ref>http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1567211,00.html</ref>

Their relationship and love letters are portrayed (published in parts) in the Swedish book ''Dj<U+00E4>vla <U+00E4>lskade unge!'', written by Pollak's personal friend Tin Anders<U+00E9>n Axell (2005).
