{{nihongo|'''Felicia'''|<U+30D5><U+30A7><U+30EA><U+30B7><U+30A2>|Ferishia}} is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[Darkstalkers]]'' series of video games. Created by [[Capcom]], she first appeared in the original ''[[Darkstalkers]]'' video game and its subsequent sequels, later appearing in other Capcom games outside of the ''Darkstalkers'' series and related media and merchandise. Felicia is voiced by [[Kae Araki]] in video games, [[Lisa Ann Beley]] in the cartoon series, and by [[Yukana Nogami]] in the Japanese anime series and [[Janyse Jaud]] in the English dub.

==Conception and design==
{{Expand section|date=January 2009}}
Early in the development of ''Darkstalkers'', the development team decided to have two female characters: a catwoman and a female vampire, characters who would become Felicia and Morrigan respectively.<ref>{{cite book |title=Darkstalkers Graphic File |last=Udon Staff |year=2008 |publisher=Udon Entertainment |isbn=1897376049 |page=56}}</ref> Initially, Felicia was intended to be the "sexy" female character of the title, while the vampire would be the "cute" female character. However, as Morrigan's design took on a tone that emphasized sexiness, Felicia's character concept was altered accordingly.<ref>{{cite book |title=Darkstalkers Graphic File |last=Udon Staff |year=2008 |publisher=Udon Entertainment |isbn=1897376049 |page=68}}</ref>

==Appearances==
===In video games===
Felicia was raised by a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[nun]] named Rose. When Rose died, Felicia left her town hoping to be a [[music]]al star. During her travels, she met many other catgirls of her kind. With her newfound friends, she set out for her dream of being on stage. Eventually, she and her friends started a musical with Felicia being the main star.

In the events of ''Vampire Savior'', she wondered about how she could make others happy. In her ending, Felicia became a nun herself and founded an [[orphanage]] named "Felicity House."

In ''[[Namco x Capcom]]'', Felicia teams up with [[King (Tekken)|King II]] from [[Tekken (series)|Tekken]]. Of all the two-character teams in the game, this is the only one to include both a Namco character and a Capcom character.  They have a single-unit Multiple Assault, the ''W Shining Wizard'', and her ''Please Help Me'' is also a Multiple Assault with the added assistance of [[Armor King]].

Felicia is also a [[player character|playable character]] in ''[[Pocket Fighter]]'', ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom series|Marvel vs. Capcom 2]]'', ''[[Puzzle Fighter]]'', ''[[Capcom Fighting Evolution]]'', ''[[SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium]]'' and is a playable card in ''[[SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash]]'', ''SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash 2'' and ''[[Namco x Capcom]]''. She is also a character card in the ''[[Universal Fighting System]]'' TCG. She will also be a character in the upcoming game [[Cross Edge]] along with [[Morrigan Aensland]],[[Lilith Aensland]],[[Demitri Maximoff]] and [[Jedah Dohma]].

===In animation===
The anime version, Felicia is shown as already having a certain amount of success as an entertainer and is just starting a tour in the human world with her own traveling show. However, her tour gets off to a rough start when she is almost killed by monks pertaining to an anti Darkstalker militia. (The world is shown as effectively being under vampire Demitri Maximov's rule with various resistance groups opposing him.) She watches as soul reaver [[Lord Raptor]] saves her by promptly killing them all.

Later, as Pyron begins his bid for world domination, interest in Felicia's show dwindles and she petulantly vents her anger on Pyron's Huitzil army. She destroys a few of the robots before being overwhelmed and she is saved when [[Jon Talbain]] intervenes. She is taken in by a human doctor and is befriended by the local children but she is later captured by a paramilitary group who have come to destroy the rest of the advancing Huitzuls. The doctor rescues her and with her faith in humanity renewed she, along with Jon Talbain, lures the Huitzils out of the town using an explosives laden train; when out of the town, Felicia and Jon Talbain escape the train and detonates it, destroying the train and all the robots that had been following.

A major difference between this Felicia and the game's Felicia is that there is no mention of her origin and her religiosity is reversed. While it can be assumed from her being raised by a nun that the game Felicia is Catholic, her anime counterpart informs Raptor she is ambivilent to organized religion. In the anime, she is voiced by [[Yukana Nogami]] {Japanese} and [[Janyse Jaud]] {English dub}.

Felicia was the main hero in the American cartoon series. Her voice actor was [[Lisa Ann Beley]]. She was perhaps the least altered, though (in accordance with American TV S&P) her breasts were considerably downsized and she appeared to be wearing a bra instead of having patches of fur. She was accompanied by Harry Grimoire, a character created for this particular series whose purpose (aside from a plot device) was mainly to get Felicia into trouble. She's also stated to be several hundred years old in this version (in fact, she got stuck with Harry when she went looking for an ancestor of his), though at this point, she would technically be 28 since the show takes place in 1995. Her dreams of being a singer are never mentioned (although in the first episode she was fired from [[Cats (musical)|Cats]] because her "costume" was "out of date").  Felicia was also depicted as possibly being the last of her kind, despite having other catgirl friends in the game series itself.

===In literature===
In the [[UDON|UDON Comics]] version of ''Darkstalkers'', Felicia is still looking for her big break into stardom; unfortunately being a catgirl proves to be a very large roadblock on the path to fame. Along the way, she runs into the [[werewolf]], Jon Talbain who believes that humans are treacherous and vile, while she thinks that the current hatred between humans and Darkstalkers are just a few "bumps in the road." Despite the fact that his interference costs her a potential gig, Felicia asks Jon to accompany her, so that she can try to prove to him that humanity is not all bad. Eventually, they end up at the Catholic orphanage where Felicia grew up. Felicia's origins are much the same as well. One notable exception is the character of the nun who raised her. Here her foster mother is named Sister Cecillia and is still alive and active in her beloved foster daughter's life.

==Promotion and reception==
Several figurines of Felicia have been made since her introduction, ranging from immobile figurines by companies such as [[Kaiyodo]], [[Volks]], Yujin, Clayz, Kotobukiya, and MIT Japan, to a posable action figure by Medicom Toy.<ref>{{cite book |title=Darkstalkers Graphic File |last=Udon Staff |year=2008 |publisher=Udon Entertainment |isbn=1897376049 |pages=136-137}}</ref>
