'''Zdenko Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107>''' (23 September 1915 <U+2013> 12 January 1947) was a Croatian [[fascist]] official who held several posts in the [[World War II]] [[Usta<U+0161>e]] regime in the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH). He was the student commissar at the Usta<U+0161>e University Centre (USS), leader of the male [[Usta<U+0161>e Youth]] organisation and a sports commissioner in the NDH. 

Born in the town of [[Biha<U+0107>]], he graduated from high school in [[Osijek]] before applying to join a polytechnic college in [[Zagreb]] with the intention of becoming a builder. He was a member of various Croatian cultural and athletic organizations during his youth, and even played as [[goalkeeper]] for Hajduk Osijek and [[HA<U+0160>K Gra<U+0111>anski]] [[association football|football]] clubs.

Briefly a member of the conservative [[Croatian Peasant Party]] (HSS), Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> was imprisoned several times by the Yugoslav authorities because of his involvement with various Croatian youth organizations which saw him often involved in clashes with left-wing students. He joined the far-right [[Usta<U+0161>e]] in 1939, and following the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]] and the establishment of the Usta<U+0161>e-led NDH in April 1941, went on to be appointed to the newly formed Usta<U+0161>e supervisory committee by [[Slavko Kvaternik]]. That same month he also became the leader of the Usta<U+0161>e University Headquarters and the Usta<U+0161>e Youth, charged with organizing student bodies at the [[University of Zagreb]] and promoting Usta<U+0161>e's policy of preventing all non-[[Croats]] from attending universities in the country.

In 1942 he was involved in the formation of the 13th Usta<U+0161>e Assault Company and by 1943 had attained a seat in the [[Croatian Parliament]]. Between 1942 and 1943 he was involved in recruiting students to join Ante Paveli<U+0107>'s personal bodyguard and was promoted to the rank of [[major]]. He held the position of head of the Usta<U+0161>e University Headquarters and Usta<U+0161>e Youth until January 1945, when he was appointed Commissioner for Physical Education and Sport. Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> fled Zagreb from the advancing [[Yugoslav Partisans]] in May 1945 and ended up in a [[refugee camp]] in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]]. In August, he was arrested by American forces who extradited him to Yugoslavia on 12 February 1946. He was tried in Zagreb on 12 January 1947, sentenced to death, and executed the same day.

==Early life and family==
Zdenko Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> was born on 23 September 1915 in the town of [[Biha<U+0107>]], the son of local politician Emilijan "Milan" Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107>.{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=41}} Ethnically [[Croats|Croat]], the Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> family was descended from  15th century tribesmen in the town of [[Livno]].<ref>{{cite web| publisher=Hrvatska enciklopedija| title=Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107>| url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=8117|accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref>

Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> finished high school in [[Osijek]] and later applied to join a polytechnic college in [[Zagreb]] with the intention of becoming a builder. In 1935, he became a member of the "Croatian Academic Society August <U+0160>enoa" ({{lang-hr|Hrvatsko akademsko dru<U+0161>tvo August <U+0160>enoa}}, HADA<U+0160>) and by 1936 he became its vice-president. A versatile athlete, he played as [[goalkeeper]] for the [[association football|football]] clubs Hajduk in Osijek and [[HA<U+0160>K Gra<U+0111>anski]] in Zagreb. He also played tennis and was one of the founders of the Drava [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] club in Osijek. For a short period of time, Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> was a member of the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] ({{lang-hr|Hrvatska selja<U+010D>ka stranka}}, HSS). After leaving the party, he became involved in various Croatian youth organizations and was imprisoned several times in Zagreb and Osijek as a result.{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=41}} During this time, he was also involved in numerous violent confrontations with [[Communist]] students.{{sfn|Yeomans|2013|p=43}}

After attending a public celebration of HSS leader [[Vladko Ma<U+010D>ek]]'s birthday on 20 June 1935, Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> was imprisoned by Yugoslav authorities and tortured for twelve days in a prison on the island of [[Kor<U+010D>ula]]. He was subsequently taken to [[Dubrovnik]] and charged with conspiring against the Yugoslav state, but was not convicted. In 1939, he joined the [[Usta<U+0161>e]],{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=41}} a Croatian [[fascist]] organization which advocated armed struggle in achieving Croatia's independence from the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=52}} During this period, he came into contact with the fascist leader [[Slavko Kvaternik]]. From late 1940 to early 1941, Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> was pursued by Yugoslav authorities because of his association with the Usta<U+0161>e and hid in Zagreb to avoid capture.{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=41}}

==World War II==

===Invasion of Yugoslavia===
On 6 April 1941 [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded Yugoslavia]]. Poorly equipped and poorly trained, the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] was quickly defeated.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=28}} The country was then dismembered by the occupying forces and the extreme nationalist and fascist Croat leader of the Usta<U+0161>e [[Ante Paveli<U+0107>]] <U+2013> who had been in exile in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] <U+2013> was appointed ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (leader) of a newly established Usta<U+0161>e-led Croatian state, the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-hr|Nezavisna Dr<U+017E>ava Hrvatska}} or NDH). The NDH combined almost all of present-day countries of [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], as well as parts of [[Serbia]], into what was described as an "Italian-German quasi-protectorate".{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=272}} Under the Usta<U+0161>e regime, genocidal policies were implemented and directed against the [[Serb]], [[Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] populations living within the country.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=52}}

===Command of the Usta<U+0161>e University Centre and Usta<U+0161>e Youth===
On 11 April, Kvaternik named Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> to the newly formed Usta<U+0161>e supervisory committee.{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=41}} On 23 April, Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> led a crowd of more than 1,100 Croatian students as they gathered in the courtyard of the [[University of Zagreb]] before going to [[St. Mark's Square, Zagreb|St. Mark's Square]] in central Zagreb to watch Paveli<U+0107> give a speech. Here, Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> and the students swore loyalty to the ''Poglavnik'' and the NDH. In a speech of his own, Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> told Paveli<U+0107> that he and the students were ready to follow him "in life and death".{{sfn|Yeomans|2013|p=29}} When the Usta<U+0161>e supervisory committee was disbanded on 9 May, Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> was named a commissioner in the main headquarters of the NDH. That same month, he was named the commander of the Usta<U+0161>e University Headquarters ({{lang-hr|Usta<U+0161>ki sveu<U+010D>ili<U+0161>ni sto<U+017E>er}}, USS).{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=41}} Although this organization technically required all students in the NDH to become members, most kept away from membership. Increasingly, the USS became a wing of the NDH's student elite with strict rules of membership and privileges, with members attending rallies at which Paveli<U+0107> spoke and wearing Usta<U+0161>e uniform.{{sfn|Yeomans|2013|p=43}} 

In an interview with ''Novi list'', Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> stated that all work at the University of Zagreb would be "in harmony with the new Usta<U+0161>a spirit&nbsp;... with which youth had been imbued for years in the decades when the university was the "battleground" of the Croatian struggle for liberation." He went on to say that the first priority of the USS was to be the social welfare of students and the expansion of student dining rooms and residential halls.{{sfn|Yeomans|2013|p=43}} He declared that the structure of the university would change to conform with Usta<U+0161>e principles <U+2013> each faculty would have its own camp, consisting of a camp leader and seven adjutants responsible for military training, socio-economic welfare, contacts, sports, professional training, education and journals. Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> explained that for the first year of academic study, the university would employ "veteran warriors" as teachers who were to be replaced by fully trained "younger forces" who had spent the previous year preparing for their new roles. Furthermore, he stated that student volunteers would collaborate in the creation and popularization of the USS and other Usta<U+0161>e organizations, which, once they had established themselves in university life, were to establish a professional, non-ideological student organization meant to incorporate all Croatian students. When asked if Serbs and Jews were to be permitted to attend universities in the NDH, Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> replied: "In the coming academic year, the university will be swept clean of foreigners hostile to Croatians and the Usta<U+0161>e movement, and in this way our endeavours at the university will be made easier."{{sfn|Yeomans|2013|p=44}} Later, while dining with the wife of a [[Sweden|Swedish]] diplomat, Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> boasted of the large number of Serbs he had killed, claiming that he placed the ears of murdered Serbs on a necklace worn over his [[smoking jacket]].{{sfn|Yeomans|2013|p=51}}

At the same time that he was appointed leader of the USS, Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> was also named commander of the male [[Usta<U+0161>e Youth]] organisation.{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=41}} In its first months, many young Croats joined the movement, with recruitment being fuelled  mostly by extreme [[Croatian nationalism]].{{sfn|Yeomans|2013|pp=89<U+2013>90}} In addition, many were motivated to join because the Youth provided athletic, intellectual and artistic training for "the next generation of Usta<U+0161>e leaders." For others, membership gave "a sense of meaning to their lives" and was appealing because it represented "a youthful rebellion against the Yugoslav state."{{sfn|Yeomans|2013|p=89}} By May, some Usta<U+0161>e Youth camps publicly announced their refusal to accept new members as they lacked the capacity to do so. Although it is unclear how many young Croats joined the movement, Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> claimed a figure of half a million members.{{sfn|Yeomans|2013|pp=89<U+2013>90}} He defined the Usta<U+0161>e Youth as a "secular movement" meant to promote "brotherly cooperation and mutual life" of peasant, working-class and intellectual youths in the NDH.{{sfn|Yeomans|2013|pp=105<U+2013>106}}

In late 1941 Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107>'s father was appointed [[mayor]] of Osijek, holding this position until 1942. That year, the younger Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> became involved in the formation of the 13th Usta<U+0161>e Assault Company, using his position as commander of the Usta<U+0161>e Youth to convince many young Croats to join. In February 1942, he became a member of the [[Croatian Parliament]]. Between 1942 and 1943 he participated in recruiting many students for Ante Paveli<U+0107>'s personal bodyguards (''Poglavnikov Tjelesni Zdrug'', PTZ) He was later promoted to the rank of army [[major]]. In 1944, he wrote a book titled ''The Youth and the State'' ({{lang-hr|Mlade<U+017E> i dr<U+017E>ava}}).{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=41}}

===Commissioner for Physical Education and Sport===
Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> held the post of commander of the USS and commander of the Usta<U+0161>e Youth until January 1945,{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=41}} when he was named Commissioner at the State Directorate for Physical Education and Sports ({{lang-hr|Dr<U+017E>avno vodstvo za tjelesni odgoj i <U+0161>port}}, DVTO<U+0160>) in the NDH. Upon taking this position, he introduced strict new sports laws that emphasized discipline during football matches and criminalised monetary and material rewards for athletes. Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> justified the new laws by saying: "Croatian sport is an amateur sport, and as such it will remain".{{sfn|Yeomans|2013|p=232}} Attempting to tackle the problem of unruly crowds, he introduced new laws banning disorderly spectators from ever entering football stadiums. Warnings by Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> and the DVTO<U+0160> were regularly printed in daily party newspapers, calling for citizens and athletes to abide by the new laws.{{sfn|Yeomans|2013|p=233}}

===Capture and execution===
As [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces descended on Zagreb, Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> left the city on 6 May 1945 and fled from Slovenia into [[Austria]]. He was subsequently placed in a [[refugee camp]] in [[Salzburg]]. On 28 August, American forces arrested him and sent him to a detainment camp before having him extradited to Yugoslavia on 12 February 1946. Bla<U+017E>ekovi<U+0107> was tried in Zagreb on 12 January 1947, sentenced to death, and executed the same day.{{sfn|Dizdar|Gr<U+010D>i<U+0107>|Ravli<U+0107>|Stupari<U+0107>|1997|p=41}}
