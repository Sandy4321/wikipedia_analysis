'''Donald Tallon''' ([[February 17]] [[1916]] in [[Bundaberg]], [[Queensland]] - [[September 7]] [[1984]] in Bundaberg) was a [[wicket-keeper]] who played [[cricket]] for [[Queensland Bulls|Queensland]] and [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] between 1946 and 1953. He is regarded as one of the finest glovemen in Test history and was part of [[Don Bradman]]'s [[The Invincibles (cricket)|Invincibles]] of 1948.

== Early years ==
Tallon was raised in the Queensland coastal sugar and rum town of [[Bundaberg]], 400 km north of [[Brisbane]]. He learned to play cricket on a backyard wicket with his three brothers and father Les, a moulder at the Bundaberg foundry. Les also played as a [[slow bowling|slow bowler]] in the local cricket competition. Tallon was formally trained as a wicket-keeper at North Bundaberg State School where he and his brothers were coached by Tom O'Shea, a teacher and former [[Sheffield Shield]] wicket-keeper. He became the primary school<U+2019>s wicket-keeper at the age of seven, when he barely stood higher than the stumps. He learned to keep to the [[leg spin]] of his brother [[Bill Tallon|Bill]], who also represented Queendsland. Tallon later said of his decision to don gloves, "You are never out of the game [as a keeper], and that suits me fine" He became the [[School Captain]] at the age of 11 and rose to become captain of Queensland Schoolboys at age 13. He played in Bundaberg<U+2019>s A grade team at 14, and came to the attention of state selectors when Bundaberg played a team captained by [[Alan Kippax]] in 1931.<ref>Perry, p. 187.</ref> 

The following season, he was playing in the Country trials in [[Brisbane]]. He was selected for the Queensland Colts in 1932-33 and represented Queensland Country against [[Douglas Jardine]]<U+2019>s [[England cricket team]] during the [[bodyline]] tour.<ref>Perry (2001), p. 187.</ref> In England<U+2019>s innings of 376, Tallon conceded only five byes and stumped [[Herbert Sutcliffe]], regarded as one of the finest batsmen in Test history.<ref name="wisden"/> He did not get a chance to display his batting prowess as the bodyline spearhead [[Harold Larwood]] rattled him with a series of deliveries aimed at the throat before bowling him. Tallon's fast and efficient skills behind the stumps further caught the eye of cricket officials in early 1933 at the Country Week Carnivals. The carnival was highlighted by the presence of [[Australian Aborigine|aboriginal]] bowler [[Eddie Gilbert]], judged by [[Don Bradman]] to be the fastest bowler he ever faced. Gilbert had caused a stir by knocking Bradman's bat out of his hand in a [[Sheffield Shield]] match and bowled at around 160 km/h, which compares favourable with the fastest bowlers of all time. Gilbert had a [[throwing (cricket)|suspect arm action]] which made it hard to spot the ball. Combined with his ethnicity in the era of the [[White Australia Policy]], Gilbert's performances attracted the spotlight. Tallon distinguished himself with his tidy keeping to Gilbert.<ref name="p early">Perry (2001), p. 188.</ref>

== First class debut ==

He made his [[first-class cricket|first-class]] debut for Queensland at 17 against [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]] in December 1933,<ref name="az">{{cite book | last = Cashman, Franks, Maxwell, Sainsbury, Stoddart, Weaver, Webster | year = 1997 | title = The A-Z of Australian cricketers|pages =289-290}}</ref> the first time he witnessed a first class match. He conceded only six byes in an innings of 542 in a tidy performance, but was dropped after the match. Queensland officials had ruled that it was not advisable to take such a young player on away trips to [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]] and [[New South Wales]]. Tallon reclaimed his position when Queensland returned for their home games and form then on, was Queensland<U+2019>s first choice. In his fourth match, he displayed his batting ability with 58 and 86 against the [[Clarrie Grimmett]] led [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]]. At the time, Grimmerr was the world's leading [[leg spin]]ner.<ref name="wisden"/>

Towards the end of 1934, Tallon moved to Brisbane where he worked as a storeman for a car company.<ref name="p early"/> In 1935-36, Tallon was the top Queensland batsman with 503 runs at an average of 55.88. He started well in a match against South Australia in Adelaide where Bradman was making a comeback from illness. The match was mainly noted for Bradman's blazing 233 but Tallon impressed Bradman with two difficult catches, one of which dismissed Bradman. Bradman praised Tallon for conceding only seven byes in a total of 642, particularly his ability to glove balls passing down the leg side. He then  scored 88 in Queensland's reply. Bradman opined that he had a "clean-hitting crisp style... attacking, positive, and with a technique to rival most first-class batsmen."<ref>Perry (2001), p. 189.</ref> The highlight was his highest first class score of 193, against Victoria in Brisbane, a match in which he also took five catches in an innings. As he continued his consistent form with both bat and glove, he came into consideration for Test selection.<ref name="wisden"/>

== Pre-war non-selection ==

At the time, Queensland was a weak cricketing state and the  Australian Board of Control's selectors tended to choose teams comprised entirely of New South Welshmen, Victorians and South Australians. [[Bert Oldfield]] was the incumbent and had no plans to retire, while Victoria's [[Ben Barnett]] had been the reserve keeper on the 1934 tour of England. South Australia's [[Charles Walker]] was also talked of as a possible Test player. When England toured for the 1936-37 Ashes series, Tallon was overlooked as the selectors persisted with Oldfield. He continued his form for Queensland, taking three dismissals against England in a tour match and 22 in total for the season. However, his position of the periphery of the team was acknowledged with a selection in an Australian XI for a trial match at the start of the season. After another strong season in 1937-38, he was tipped for selection in squad for the 1938 Ashes tour.<ref>Perry (2001), p. 190.</ref> 

Tallons's non-selection for the 1938 Ashes touring party surprised commentators. Bradman had lobbied on the selection panel for Tallon and Walker, asserting that Oldfield was past his best. The other two selectors, E A Dwyer from New South Wales and Bill Johnson from Victoria, outvoted Bradman. They selected Barnett because of his previous tour to England, and Walker. Tallon's omission was overshadowed by that of Grimmett, still regarded alongside [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] as the world's leading legspinner. No official reason was given for Tallon's omission. An unofficial reason for his omission was that he was not familiar with the bowling of Australia's three spinners: O'Reilly, [[Chuck Fleetwood-Smith]] and [[Frank Ward]]. Another was Tallon's preference in standing back to medium pacers. In reality, Tallon stood back and stood up to the stumps depending on the situation. While the ball was swinging, he would stand back to avoid the risk of missing an edge. When the the ball was old, he would stand up to the stumps and effect many stumpings with his fast reflexes. During the series, Barnett made two notable errors. With Australia leading the series 1-0 going into the Fifth Test at [[The Oval]]. Barnett dropped [[Len Hutton]] and [[Maurice Leyland]] when both were on 40. Leyland went on to post 177 while Hutton set a Test world record of 364. In effect, England were gifted an extra 461 runs as they set a world record score of 7/903. Bradman injured himself during the marathon innings in a rare stint at the bowling crease after the specialist bowlers had failed to break the Englishmen. With ten men, Australia fell to its heaviest innings defeat in Test history and the series was drawn.<ref>Perry (2001), p. 191.</ref> 

His response to Australian selectors during the 1938-39 season was to equal two world records. Against [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] in [[Sydney]], he dismissed twelve batsmen, six in each innings, a feat performed only once before, in 1868 by [[surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]]'s [[Edward Pooley]]. Two matches later he became the fourth keeper to make seven dismissals in an innings, in a match against Victoria. He did not concede a bye in the innings of 348.<ref name="wisden"/> Tallon finished the season with 34 dismissals in six matches, setting a new Australian season record. He took more than five dismissals in an innings in four of the ten innings in which he kept wickets. Observers noted Tallon to be more motivated than ever; his catching and stumping style became more furious, and his appealing reached new levels of sound. He passed 100 first class dismissals during the season in 32 matches - the fastest Australian to reach the mark. He also struck a century before lunch in a 90 minute session against New South Wales in Brisbane, the first player to achieve such a feat in Queensland history.<ref>Perry (2001), p. 192.</ref>

== Post war resumption of career ==
[[Image:Don Tallon graph.png|300px|right|thumb|Don Tallon's Test career performance chart.]]
Following his form in 1938&ndash;39, Tallon eagerly awaited for the 1940&ndash;41 tour to Australia by England, when he would only be 24. He was regarded as almost a certain selection following his record-breaking performance with both bat and glove. The outbreak of the [[Second World War]] put a halt of Tallon<U+2019>s rise and robbed him of his physical prime; he was 23 when war broke out and cricket did not resume until he was 29. First class cricket was canceled and Tallon joined the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian Army]] in 1939. He was dischared in 1942 with a stomach ulcer and later had a major operation to remove part of his stomach. His chances of international selection waned as the war dragged on. He was 30 when first class cricket resumed in 1945&ndash;46.<ref>Perry (2001), p. 193.</ref>

Upon the resumption, Tallon's chances of selection had improved due to the fate of his wicketkeeping contemporaries during the war. Oldfield had long retired. Barnett was a captain in the army and had been a prisoner of the Japanese at [[Changi]] prison in [[Singapore]] for four years. Emaciated, he slowly recovered his fitness and forced his way back into the Victorian team, but was almost 40 and intended to retire in the near future. Walker was a gunner in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] and was killed in a duel with German fighter pilots over [[Soltau]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. This left Tallon as the front-runnner, but there was a possibility that the selectors would opt for generational change and install a youthful gloveman like [[Gil Langley]] or [[Ron Saggers]] with an eye to a prolonged stint as the Test keeper. With pressure mounting for selection, Tallon took eight wickets in a match against New South Wales in Brisbane. It was marked by three stumpings and three catches from the [[leg spin]] of [[Colin McCool]], a future Test team-mate. The performance was to herald the start of a prolific bowler-wicketkeeper duo.<ref name="postwarearly">Perry (2001), p. 194.</ref>

== Test debut ==

Tallon made his debut in the retrospectively accredited one-off Test against [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] at [[Wellington]] in March 1946. On a wet wicket, New Zealand were dismissed for 42 and 54 against the slow bowling of [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Ernie Toshack]]. Tallon made a stumping, [[run out]] and took a catch. He made only five runs as Australia won by an innings and 103 runs. Tallon had rarely kept to O'Reilly's leg spin and impressed the bowler, who compared him with Oldfield.<ref name="postwarearly"/><ref name="testlist">{{cite web

The following season saw Australia's first Test series since the war interruption, with five matches scheduled against [[Wally Hammond]]'s touring Englishmen in 1946&ndash;47. Tallon staked his claim for the national wicketkeeping position in Queensland's first match of the season, which was against England. Tallon combined with McCool in four stumpings and two catches to register 170 first class dismissals in only 50 matches. Tallon's proficiency with McCool was another factor in his favour as McCool was now Australia's first-choice spinner after the retirement of O'Reilly.<ref name="postwarearly"/> Tallon was duly selected for the First Test of the series in ??. In his first Test on Australian soil, he took two catches but scored only 14 in a victory. Tallon was worried that his poor batting might lead to him being replaced, but was retained as Australia took an innings victory in Sydney. He performed strongly, with four catches and two stumpings and a knock of 30. The only downside was a dislocated finger.<ref name="eng47"/> Beyond the raw statistics, two of the catches that Tallon made in the first innings were regarded as one of his finest ever and turned the tide of the match. [[Len Hutton]] and [[Bill Edrich]], two of England's leading batsmen had seen their team to lunch with only one wicket down. Tallon declared to Bradman that he intended to dismiss Hutton down the leg side, so Bradman brought [[off spin]]ner [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] into the attack immediately after lunch. Johnson was instructed to bowl at Hutton's legs to give him an opportunity to glance the ball. Hutton obliged and struck the ball from the middle of his bat, expecting a [[four (cricket)|boundary]]. He turned around and was shocked to see that Tallon had intercepted the ball from a blind position at a range of just one metre. The score was 2/88 as the man who held the Test world record score of 364 was dismissed and [[Denis Compton]] replaced him at the batting crease. Bradman introduced McCool and Compton misjudged a cut shot which went wide of Tallon and struck Johnson, fielding at slip, in the chest. The ball bounced past Tallon's shoulder and was headed for the ground when he spun and dived backwards to catch it just before it landed. According to [[Roland Perry]], it was "an acrobatic feat that would put any trapeze artist in the shade, taking one of the most brilliant catches in Test history." Tallon took another difficult catch from McCool to dismiss Hammond and England fell to 4/99 with the loss of their three finest batsmen to improbable catches. This restricted England and allowed Australia to set up a large total, and with it, a large match-winning lead.<ref>Perry (2001), pp. 185&ndash;186.</ref>

Tallon now felt secure about his place in the team for the rest of the series. This lead to increased confidence in his play in the Third Test at [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|Melbourne]]. After keeping tidily and scoring 35 in the first innings, Tallon combined with [[Ray Lindwall]] in the second innings for a 154 run partnership in just 92 minutes. Described by [[Wisden]] as a <U+2018><U+2018>hurricane<U+2019><U+2019>, the partnership was marked by Tallon<U+2019>s powerful driving. Lindwall reached his century, but Tallon fell for 92 to [[Doug Wright]] after a display which featured prolific cutting. Tallon's keeping was further lauded in the second innings of the Fifth Test, when he stumped Edrich, [[Jack Ikin]] and [[Alec Bedser]] from McCools' bowling. By series end, Tallon had set a Test record of twenty dismissals in a series and averaged 29 with the bat.<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="testlist"/><ref name="eng47">Perry (2001), p. 195.</ref>

Tallon played in all five Tests against [[India national cricket team|India]] in 1947&ndash;48, and earned praise from Indian skipper [[Lala Amarnath]] who described him as the "greatest keeper he had seen".<ref>Perry (2001), p. 196.</ref>

== Invincibles tour ==
Tallon's form in the two preceding Australian seasons saw him selected for the 1948 Ashes tour as part of Don Bradman<U+2019>s <U+2018><U+2018>Invincibles<U+2019><U+2019>. Tallon was the first-choice gloveman with Saggers as his deputy. Having spent the majority of his life in sunny Queensland and growing up in  tropical Bundaberg, the cold English climate initially caught Tallon off guard. He did not wet his inner gloves as was his custom due to the temperature. In the early part of the tour he sustained a bruised right finger when he lost sight of a [[Ray Lindwall]] [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]] on a misty morning at [[The Oval]] and was hit as he put hand over his face. As England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, this meant that the ball would frequently be in a favourable state for fast bowling. As a result, Australia adopted a pace-oriented strategy and McCool was not to play a Test on the tour as Johnson was the only regular spinner. This deprived Tallon of an opportunity to show his stumping abilities standing up the batsmen.<ref>Perry (2001), pp. 197&ndash;198.</ref>


He played in all the Tests except the Fourth Test at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] due to injury. Tallon batted modestly, with a best of 53 in the Second Test at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]]. His acrobatic catch of [[Len Hutton]] down the leg side in the Fifth test at [[The Oval]] was considered the catch of the season.<ref name="wisden">{{cite web| title= Wisden 1949 - Don Tallon |url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/154630.html| year= 1949 |accessdate=2007-05-31| publisher=-[[Wisden]]}}</ref>

== Later career ==

Upon his return to Australia, he made an unbeaten 146 in Bradman<U+2019>s Testimonial match. He featured in a tenth wicket stand of 100 with [[Geff Noblet]], who scored only nine as Tallon farmed the strike effectively. Tallon withdrew from the 1949-50 tour to [[South Africa]] due to personal reasons. He returned for the home Ashes series against England in 1950-51, playing in all five Tests. He missed the 1951-52 season due to health reasons, and was unable to reclaim his Test place in 1952-53 despite making a century against the touring [[South African cricket team|South Africans]] for Queensland. He was selected for the 1953 tour of England, and played in the First Test before being dropped in place of [[Gil Langley]]. He retired after the first match of the 1953-54 Sheffield Shield season, continuing to play in Bundaberg for the next decade.<ref name="az"/>

Regarded as one of Australia<U+2019>s finest ever wicket-keepers, Tallon was known for his understated style, which was without flourish or flamboyancy. He was known for his anticipation of the flight, length and spin of the ball. He was in particular known for his stumping efficiency and his ability to catch balls down the leg side. Strong driving and quick scoring noted his batting, which was enabled by his swift footwork.<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="az"/>

Tallon married and his son Ross played one match for Queensland Colts in 1967-68.<ref name="az"/>
