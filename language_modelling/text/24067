'''Sheerness''' is a town on the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in [[Kent]], [[England]]. It is the largest town on the island with a population of about 20,000.

==History==
Sheerness was the focus of an attack by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] navy in June [[1667]], when 72 hostile ships during the [[Raid on the Medway]] compelled the little "sandspit fort", to surrender and landed a force which for a short while occupied the town. Impressed by the civil behavior of the Dutch marines - they paid for their dinner - the town reinvited the [[Dutch Marine Corps]] for the third centennial of the raid. Pepys at [[Gravesend, England|Gravesend]] remarked in his diary "we do plainly at this time hear the guns play" and in fear departed to [[Brampton, Cambridgeshire|Brampton]] in [[Huntingdonshire]].

Sheerness was also the site of a Royal Dockyard which, although not as large as those at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] and [[Deptford]] was still of some importance in [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and [[Stuart]] England. During the Victorian age a warship was built which still exists - HMS Gannet (an "Osprey" class Sloop) which was launched on 31 August 1878. She was capable of running under sail or steam and served the Royal Navy throughout the world, and has now been restored to her 1878 glory and is preserved in dry dock at the former Royal Dockyard at Chatham (having arrived at Chatham in 1987).

Sheerness was the home of the [[Nore Command]] which spread from [[Portsmouth]] to the Wash. So was the main Naval Dockyard in the region and was the site of the [[Nore mutiny]]. It was also the location of the 2nd major arsenal after [[Woolwich Arsenal]] and included HMS Wildfire the Naval Gunnery School

==Railways==
In 1860 the town was linked to mainland by a branch railway line from [[Sittingbourne]]; at the same time the Kingsferry bridge gave better communications with the island, succeeding the ferries which had at one time been the only connection.This was built by the London Chatham and Dover Railway Company,involving an opening span bridge to allow large ships to pass through.The rail bridge was also surfaced as a road bridge and was originally a toll bridge.In 1959 a new Kingsferry Bridge involving a tall concrete liftable span and towers was opened with separate lanes for road and rail. The line opened on [[19 July]] [[1860]]. A branch to a pier at [[Queenborough]] served a steamer service to [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]] in Holland for many years. The [[Sheppey Light Railway]], opened in 1901, also provided services to Leysdown on the opposite end of the island from the town until its closure in 1948.

==Sheerness Docks==
The dockyard <U+2014> now Sheerness Docks <U+2014> is a significant feature of the Isle of Sheppey's economy, which includes the extensive export-garden ornaments,import of cars, and a steel works, with extensive railway fixtures. It is one of the biggest fruit-handling ports in the UK, with 800,000 tonnes of fruit and vegetables being offloaded each year. The dockyard wall is notable for a large population of scorpions, thought to have been introduced with fruit imports. Fortunately they are a harmless variety.
