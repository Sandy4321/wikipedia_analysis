The '''Special Activities Division''' ('''SAD''') is a division in the [[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s (CIA) [[National Clandestine Service]] (NCS) responsible for [[covert operations]] known as "special activities". Within SAD there are two separate groups, one for tactical paramilitary operations and another for covert political action.<ref name="Daugherty 2004">Daugherty (2004)</ref>
The Political Action Group within SAD is responsible for covert activities related to political influence, [[Psychological warfare|psychological]] and [[economic warfare]]. The rapid development of technology has added [[cyberwarfare]] to their mission. A large covert operation usually has components that involve many, or all, of these categories, as well as paramilitary operations.

Special Operations Group (SOG) is the element within SAD responsible for paramilitary operations. These operations include the collection of [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] in hostile countries and regions, and all high threat military or intelligence operations with which the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] does not wish to be overtly associated.<ref name="dallas">{{cite news |work=[[Dallas Morning News]] |date=October 27, 2002 |title=CIA commandos remain covert |last=Robberson |first=Tod |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2002/021027-cia1.htm}}</ref>  As such, members of the unit (called Paramilitary Operations Officers and Specialized Skills Officers) normally do not carry any objects or clothing (e.g., military uniforms) that would associate them with the United States government.<ref name="woodward-post">{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Woodward |authorlink=Bob Woodward |date=November 18, 2001 |title=Secret CIA Units Playing  Central Combat Role |work=Washington Post |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/CIA18.html}}</ref> If they are compromised during a mission, the government of the United States may [[Plausible deniability|deny all knowledge]].<ref>Special Operations Forces (SOF) and CIA Paramilitary Operations: Issues for Congress, CRS-2 http://ftp.fas.org/sgp/crs/intel/RS22017.pdf</ref>

The SAD/SOG is generally considered the most secretive special operations force in the United States. The group selects operatives from [[Delta Force]], [[DEVGRU]], and other special operations forces from within the [[U.S. military]].

SAD/SOG Paramilitary Operations Officers are a majority of the recipients of the [[Distinguished Intelligence Cross]] and the [[Intelligence Star]], the two highest medals for valor in the CIA. They also make up the majority of those honored on the [[CIA Memorial Wall|Memorial Wall at CIA headquarters]].<ref>Gup, Ted (2000). ''The Book of Honor: Cover Lives and Classified Deaths at the CIA.''</ref>

==Overview==
SAD provides the President of the United States with an option when overt military and/or diplomatic actions are not viable or politically feasible. SAD can be directly tasked by the President of the United States or the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] at the President's direction. This is unlike any other U.S. special mission force. However, SAD/SOG has far fewer members than most of the other special missions units, such as the U.S. Army's 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta ([[Delta Force]]) or [[United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group|Naval Special Warfare Development Group]] (formerly known as SEAL Team Six).<ref name='Southworth'>Southworth (2002)</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Joint Publication 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] |date=October 17, 2008 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf |format=PDF |pages=512 |accessdate=November 29, 2008}}</ref><ref name='Waller'>Waller, Douglas (February 3, 2003).

As the action arm of the NCS, SAD/SOG conducts [[military direct action]] missions such as [[Raid (military)|raids]], [[ambush]]es, [[sabotage]], [[targeted killing]]s<ref>{{cite news |title=CIA Pakistan Campaign is Working Director Say |first=Mark |last=Mazzetti |coauthors=Helene Cooper |work=New York Times |date=February 26, 2009 |page=A15}}</ref><ref name="CIA Secret Program PM">{{cite news |title=CIA Secret Program: PM Teams Targeting Al Qaeda |first=Greg |last=Miller |work=Los Angeles Times |date=July 14, 2009 |page=A1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=CIA Had Plan To Assassinate Qaeda Leaders |first=Mark |last=Mazzetti |coauthors=Shane Scott |work=New York Times |date=July 14, 2009 |page=A1}}</ref> and [[unconventional warfare]] (e.g., training and leading [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] and military units of other countries in combat). SAD/SOG also conducts [[special reconnaissance]], that can be either military or [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] driven, but is carried out by Paramilitary Officers (also called Paramilitary Operatives) when in "[[denied area|non-permissive environment]]s". Paramilitary Operations Officers are also fully trained case officers and as such conduct clandestine human intelligence ([[HUMINT]]) operations throughout the world.<ref name='Coll 2004'>Coll (2004)</ref> SAD/SOG officers are selected from the most elite U.S. military units.<ref name='Waller'/>

The political action group within SAD conducts the deniable [[Psychological warfare|psychological operations]], also known as [[black propaganda]], as well as "Covert Influence" to effect political change as an important part of any Administration's foreign policy.<ref name="Daugherty 2004"/> Covert intervention in a foreign election is the most significant form of political action. This could involve financial support for favored candidates, media guidance, technical support for [[public relations]], get-out-the-vote or political organizing efforts, legal expertise, advertising campaigns, assistance with poll-watching, and other means of direct action. Policy decisions could be influenced by assets, such as subversion of officials of the country, to make decisions in their official capacity that are in the furtherance of U.S. policy aims. In addition, mechanisms for forming and developing opinions involve the covert use of [[propaganda]].<ref name="americanforeignrelations.com">"americanforeignrelations.com"</ref>

Propaganda includes leaflets, newspapers, magazines, books, radio, and television, all of which are geared to convey the U.S. message appropriate to the region. These techniques have expanded to cover the internet as well. They may employ officers to work as journalists, recruit agents of influence, operate media platforms, plant certain stories or information in places it is hoped it will come to public attention, or seek to deny and/or discredit information that is public knowledge. In all such propaganda efforts, "black" operations denote those in which the audience is to be kept ignorant of the source; "white" efforts are those in which the originator openly acknowledges himself; and "gray" operations are those in which the source is partly but not fully acknowledged.<ref name="americanforeignrelations.com"/><ref>name="foreignpolicyjournal.com">http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/04/15/u-s-aggressiveness-towards-iran/</ref>

Some examples of political action programs were the prevention of the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) from winning elections between 1948 and the late 1960s; overthrowing the governments of [[1953 Iranian coup d'<U+00E9>tat|Iran in 1953]], [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'<U+00E9>tat|Guatemala in 1954]], and [[Indonesia]] in 1957, as well as providing funds and support to the [[trade union]] federation [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] following the imposition of [[martial law in Poland]] after 1981.<ref>Daugherty (2004), p.83</ref>

SAD's existence became better known as a result of the "[[War on Terror|Global War on Terror]]". Beginning in autumn of 2001, SAD/SOG paramilitary teams arrived in [[Afghanistan]] to hunt down [[al-Qaeda]] leaders, facilitate the entry of [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]] and lead the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan]] against the ruling [[Taliban]]. SAD/SOG units also defeated [[Ansar al-Islam]] in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] prior to the [[invasion of Iraq]] in 2003<ref name='Woodward 2004'/><ref name='Tucker 2008'>Tucker (2008)</ref> and trained, equipped, organized and led the [[Kurd]]ish [[peshmerga]] forces to defeat the [[Iraqi army]] in northern Iraq.<ref name='Coll 2004'/><ref name='Woodward 2004'>Woodward (2004)</ref> Despite being the most covert unit in U.S. Special Operations, numerous books have been published on the exploits of CIA paramilitary officers, including Conboy & Morrison's "Feet to the Fire: CIA Covert Operations in Indonesia",<ref name='feettofire'>Conboy (1999)</ref> and Warner's "Shooting at the Moon: The Story of America's Clandestine War in Laos.<ref>Warner" (1996)</ref> Most experts consider SAD/SOG the premiere force for [[unconventional warfare]] (UW), whether that warfare consists of either creating or combating an insurgency in a foreign country.<ref name='Southworth'/><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TLu2K11cXSMC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=Special+activities+division+most+elite&source=bl&ots=USD9Znu89N&sig=aZxMxKAMi4r0iAtgn6xdDK_-o5U&hl=en&ei=gvaFSp61JJWEtge77tXnDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title="Special OPS: America's elite forces in 21st century combat" By Fred J.

In the 2003 book, "Special OPS: America's elite forces in 21st century combat", the author states:

:"Highly classified, the SAD is regarded as the preeminent special operations unit in the world. Members are the elite of the elite; "the best period."  This results from the sources from which the organization recruits its members: Special missions units (SMUs); such as Delta Force and NSWDG (United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group)..."<ref>Special OPS: America's elite forces in 21st century combat, Fred J.

[[File:SOCOM.jpg|right|150px|]]
There remains some conflict between the [[National Clandestine Service]] and the more clandestine parts of the [[United States Special Operations Command]] (USSOCOM),<ref>{{cite journal |last=Vickers |first=Michael G |authorlink=Michael G. Vickers |title=Testimony of Michael G.

One of these missions is the recruiting, training, and leading of indigenous forces in combat operations.<ref name='USAWC 2003'/> SAD/SOG and its successors have been used when it was considered desirable to have [[plausible deniability]] about U.S. support (this is called a [[covert operation]] or "covert action").<ref name='Coll 2004'/> Unlike other special missions units, SAD/SOG operatives combine special operations and clandestine intelligence capabilities in one individual.<ref name='Waller'/> These individuals can operate in any environment (sea, air or ground) with limited to no support.<ref name='Southworth'/>

==Covert action==
Under U.S. law, the CIA is authorized to collect intelligence, conduct counterintelligence and to conduct [[Covert operation|covert action]] by the [[National Security Act of 1947]].<ref name='Daugherty 2004'/> President [[Ronald Reagan]] issued [[Executive Order 12333]] titled "United States Intelligence Activities" in 1984. This order defined covert action as "special activities," both political and military, that the U.S. government would deny, granting such operations exclusively to the CIA. The CIA was also designated as the sole authority under the 1991 Intelligence Authorization Act and mirrored in [[Title 50 of the United States Code]] Section 413(e).<ref name='Daugherty 2004'/><ref name='USAWC 2003'/> The CIA must have a "Presidential Finding" issued by the President of the United States in order to conduct these activities under the Hughes-Ryan amendment to the 1991 Intelligence Authorization Act.<ref>Daugherty (2004), p.25</ref>  These findings are then monitored by the oversight committees in both the [[US Senate|U.S. Senate]], called the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] (SSCI) and the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], called the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] (HPSCI).<ref>Daugherty (2004), p.28</ref>

Every U.S. President since [[George Washington]] has used covert action as a part of their broader foreign policy, whether Republican or Democrat, [[Liberalism|liberal]] or conservative.<ref>Daugherty (2004), p.23.</ref>  A majority of these covert action operations were successful.<ref name="Daugherty 2004, Preface XX">Daugherty (2004), Preface XX.</ref>  Most of the operations that were not successful were directed by the President over the objections of the CIA.<ref name="Daugherty 2004, Preface XX"/>  Some of the most controversial "covert action" programs, such as the [[Iran-Contra]] affair, were not primarily the work of the CIA.<ref>Daugherty (2004), p.30.</ref> Covert action programs are also much less expensive than overt political or military actions.<ref name='Daugherty 2004'/> The Pentagon commissioned a study to determine whether the CIA or the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) should conduct covert action paramilitary operations. Their study determined that the CIA should maintain this capability and be the "sole government agency conducting covert action."  The DoD found that, even under U.S. law, it does not have the legal authority to conduct covert action, nor the operational agility to carry out these types of missions.<ref>Study Urges CIA Not To Cede Paramilitary Functions to Pentagon, Ann Scott Tyson, Washington Post Staff Writer, February 5, 2005; Page A08, http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A168-2005Feb4.htm</ref>  The operation in May 2011 that resulted in the death of [[Osama bin Ladin]] was a covert action under the authority of the CIA.<ref name="washingtonpost1">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/osama_bin_laden_killed_in_cia_operation/2011/05/01/AFLiqoVF_gallery.html?wprss=rss_national-security |title=Osama bin Laden killed in CIA operation |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=May 19, 2011 |date=May 8, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Dilanian">{{cite news|last=Dilanian |first=Ken |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-osama-bin-laden-cia-20110502,0,6466214.story?track=rss |title=CIA led U.S. special forces mission against Osama bin Laden |work=Los Angeles Times  |date=May 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref>

==Selection and training==
[[File:JSOC emblem.jpg|right|150px|Emblem of the [[Joint Special Operations Command]]]]
SAD/SOG has several hundred officers, mostly former members of [[special operations forces]] (SOF) and a majority from the [[Joint Special Operations Command]] (JSOC).<ref>http://www.haqeeqat.org/2009/07/20/dick-cheney-ordered-benazirs-assassination/</ref> The CIA has also recruited individuals within the agency.<ref name='so'>{{cite web|url=http://cia.americanspecialops.com// |title=CIA Special Operations Group , Special Activities Division |publisher=Cia.americanspecialops.com |accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref> The CIA's formal position for these individuals is "Paramilitary Operations Officers" and "Specialized Skills Officers." Paramilitary Operations Officers attend the Clandestine Service Trainee (CST) program, which trains them as clandestine intelligence operatives (i.e. "spies"; known as "Core Collectors" within the Agency). The primary strengths of SAD/SOG Paramilitary Officers are agility, adaptability, and deniability. They often operate in small teams, typically with six operators (with some operations being carried out by a single officer), all with extensive military special operations expertise and specialized skills that do not exist in any other unit.<ref name='Waller'/>
As fully trained intelligence case officers, Paramilitary Operations Officers possess all the clandestine skills to collect human intelligence<U+2014>and most importantly<U+2014>to recruit assets from among the indigenous troops receiving their training. These officers often operate in remote locations behind enemy lines to carry out [[direct action (military)|direct action]] (including [[Raid (military)|raids]] and [[sabotage]]), [[counter-intelligence]], [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] or [[unconventional warfare]] (UW), [[counter-terrorism]], and [[Hostage crisis|hostage rescue]] missions, in addition to being able to conduct espionage via [[Human intelligence (espionage)|HUMINT]] assets. 

There are four principal elements within SAD's Special Operations Group: the Air Branch, the Maritime Branch, the Ground Branch, and the Armor and Special Programs Branch. The Armor and Special Programs Branch is charged with development, testing, and covert procurement of new personnel and vehicular armor and maintenance of stockpiles of ordnance and weapons systems used by SOG, almost all of which must be obtained from clandestine sources abroad, in order to provide SOG operatives and their foreign trainees with plausible deniability in accordance with U.S. Congressional directives.

Together, SAD/SOG contains a complete [[combined arms]] covert military. Paramilitary Operations Officers are the core of each branch and routinely move between the branches to gain expertise in all aspects of SOG.
<ref name="so"/> As such, Paramilitary Operations Officers are trained to operate in all of these areas and environments. Because these officers are taken from the most highly-trained units in the U.S. military and then provided with extensive additional training to become CIA clandestine intelligence officers and SAD/SOG operatives in all of these environments, many U.S. security experts assess them as the most elite of the U.S. special missions units.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TLu2K11cXSMC&pg=PA24&dq=special+ops:+america%27s+elite+forces+delta+the+best+period&lr=#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title="Special OPS: America's elite forces in 21st century combat" By Fred J.

Many have advanced degrees such as Master's and law degrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/about-cia/faqs/index.html |title=FAQs <U+2013> Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref>  Many candidates come from notable schools, such as many [[Ivy League]] institutions, but the majority of recruits today come from middle-class backgrounds.<ref>{{cite web|last=Luttwak |first=Edward N. |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2433/ |title=The CIA Is D<U+00E9>class<U+00E9> <U+2013> By Edward N.

==History==
===World War II===
[[File:William Donovan.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[William Joseph Donovan]]]]
While the [[World War II]] [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) was technically a military agency under the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], in practice it was fairly autonomous of military control and enjoyed direct access to [[List of Presidents of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Major General [[William Joseph Donovan]] was the head of the OSS. Donovan was a soldier and [[Medal of Honor]] recipient from [[World War I]]. He was also a lawyer and former classmate of FDR at [[Columbia Law School]].<ref>Wild Bill Donovan: The Last Hero, Anthony Cave Brown, New York City, Times Books, 1982</ref>  Like the subsequent CIA, OSS included both [[HUMINT|human intelligence functions]] and special operations paramilitary functions. Its Secret Intelligence division was responsible for espionage, while its [[Operation Jedburgh|Jedburgh]] teams, a joint U.S.-UK-French unit, were an ancestor of groups that create guerrilla units, such as the U.S. Army Special Forces and the CIA. OSS' Operational Groups were larger U.S. units that carried out direct action behind enemy lines. Even during World War II, the idea of intelligence and special operations units not under strict military control was controversial. OSS operated primarily in the [[European Theater of Operations]] (ETO) and to some extent in the [[China-Burma-India Theater]], while [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] was extremely reluctant to have any OSS personnel within his area of operations.

From 1943<U+2013>1945, the OSS also played a major role in training [[Kuomintang]] troops in China and [[Burma]], and recruited other indigenous irregular forces for sabotage as well as guides for [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] in [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|Burma]] fighting the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]]. OSS also helped arm, train and supply [[resistance movement]]s, including [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's Liberation Army]] in China and the [[Viet Minh]] in [[French Indochina]], in areas [[military occupation|occupied]] by the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]]. Other functions of the OSS included the use of [[propaganda]], espionage, [[Subversion (politics)|subversion]], and post-war planning.

One of the greatest accomplishments of the OSS during World War II was its penetration of [[Nazi Germany]] by OSS operatives. The OSS was responsible for training German and [[Austrian people|Austrian]] commandos for missions inside Nazi Germany. Some of these agents included exiled communists and socialist party members, [[labor activist]]s, [[anti-Nazi]] [[POW]]s, and German and [[Jewish refugees]]. At the height of its influence during World War II, the OSS employed almost 24,000 people.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/spies.revealed.ap/index.html Chef Julia Child, others part of World War II spy network], CNN, August 14, 2008</ref>

OSS Paramilitary Officers parachuted into many countries that were behind enemy lines, including France, Norway, Greece and The Netherlands. In [[Crete]], OSS paramilitary officers linked up with, equipped and fought alongside [[Greek resistance]] forces against the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation]].

OSS was disbanded shortly after World War II, with its intelligence analysis functions moving temporarily into the U.S. [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]. Espionage and counterintelligence went into military units. The paramilitary and related functions went into an assortment of ''ad hoc'' groups such as the [[Office of Policy Coordination]]. Between the original creation of the CIA by the [[National Security Act of 1947]] and various mergers and reorganizations through 1952, [[Office of Strategic Services#How the OSS became the CIA|the wartime OSS functions generally went into CIA]]. The mission of training and leading of guerrillas generally stayed in the [[United States Army Special Forces]], but the missions that were required to remain covert went to the paramilitary arm of the CIA. The direct descendant of the OSS' special operations is the CIA's Special Activities Division.

===Tibet===
[[File:Tenzin Gyatzo foto 1.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[14th Dalai Lama]]]]
After the [[Chinese invasion of Tibet]] in October 1950, the CIA inserted SAD paramilitary teams into [[Tibet]] to train and lead [[Tibetan resistance]] fighters against the [[People's Liberation Army]] of China. These teams selected and then trained Tibetan soldiers in the [[Rocky Mountains]] of the United States.<ref name="The CIA 2002">The CIA's Secret War in Tibet, Kenneth Conboy, James Morrison, The University Press of Kansas, 2002.</ref>  The SAD teams then advised and led these [[commando]]s against the Chinese, both from [[Nepal]] and India. In addition, SAD Paramilitary Officers were responsible for the [[Dalai Lama]]'s clandestine escape to India, narrowly escaping capture and certain execution by the Chinese government.<ref name="The CIA 2002"/>

According to a book by retired CIA officer John Kenneth Knaus, entitled "Orphans Of The Cold War: America And The Tibetan Struggle For Survival", Gyalo Thondup, the older brother of the 14th (and current) Dalai Lama, sent the CIA five Tibetan recruits. These recruits were then trained in paramilitary tactics on the island of [[Saipan]] in the [[Northern Marianas]].<ref>Fitsanakis, Joseph, CIA Veteran Reveals Agency<U+2019>s Operations in Tibet, intelNews, 2009-03-14 <http://intelligencenews.wordpress.com/2009/03/14/01-100></ref>  Shortly thereafter, the five men were covertly returned to Tibet <U+201C>to assess and organize the resistance<U+201D> and selected another 300 Tibetans for training. U.S. assistance to the Tibetan resistance ceased after the [[1972 Nixon visit to China]], after which the U.S. and Communist China normalized relations.<ref>Orphans Of The Cold War America And The Tibetan Struggle For Survival, John Kenneth Knaus, 1999 IBN 1-891620-85-1</ref>

===Korea===
[[File:Battle of Inchon.png|thumb|left|200px|[[Battle of Incheon]]]]The CIA sponsored a variety of activities during the [[Korean War]]. These activities included maritime operations behind North Korean lines. Yong Do Island, connected by a rugged isthmus to [[Pusan]], served as the base for those operations. These operations were carried out by well-trained Korean guerrillas. The four principal U.S. advisers responsible for the training and operational planning of those special missions were Dutch Kramer, [[Tom Curtis]], George Atcheson and Joe Pagnella. All of these Paramilitary Operations Officers operated through a CIA front organization called the [[Joint Advisory Commission, Korea]] (JACK), headquartered at Tongnae, a village near Pusan, on the peninsula's southeast coast.<ref name="historynet.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/korean-war-cia-sponsored-secret-naval-raids.htm |title=Korean War: CIA-Sponsored Secret Naval Raids |publisher=History Net |accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref>  These paramilitary teams were responsible for numerous maritime raids and ambushes behind North Korean lines, as well as [[prisoner of war]] rescue operations. These were the first maritime [[unconventional warfare]] units that trained indigenous forces as [[Proxy war|surrogates]]. They also provided a model, along with the other CIA-sponsored ground based paramilitary Korean operations, for the [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam-Studies and Observations Group]] (MACV-SOG) activities conducted by the U.S. military and the CIA/SAD in [[Vietnam]].<ref name='Southworth'/><ref name="historynet.com"/> In addition, CIA paramilitary ground-based teams worked directly for U.S. military commanders, specifically with the 8th Army, on the "White Tiger" initiative. This initiative included inserting South Korean commandos and CIA Paramilitary Operations Officers prior to the two major amphibious assaults on [[North Korea]], including the landing at [[Inchon]].<ref name='Southworth'/>

===Cuba (1961)===
{{Main|Bay of Pigs Invasion}}
[[File:Cuba Bahia de Cochinos-en.svg|200px|right|thumb|Map showing the location of the [[Bay of Pigs]]]]
The Bay of Pigs Invasion (known as "La Batalla de Gir<U+00F3>n", or "Playa Gir<U+00F3>n" in Cuba), was an unsuccessful attempt by a U.S.-trained force of [[Cuban exile]]s to invade southern [[Cuba]] with support from U.S. government armed forces, to overthrow the Cuban government of [[Fidel Castro]]. The plan was launched in April 1961, less than three months after [[John F. Kennedy]] assumed the presidency in the United States.

===Vietnam and Laos===
[[File:South Vietnam Map.jpg|thumb|left|150px|South Vietnam, Military Regions, 1967]] The original OSS mission in [[Vietnam]] under Major Archimedes Patti was to work with [[Ho Chi Minh]] in order to prepare his forces to assist the United States and their [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in fighting the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]. After the end of World War II, the United States ignored the attempts of Ho Chi Minh to maintain a friendly relationship. Instead, in 1945 the US agreed at Potsdam to turn Vietnam back to their previous French colonizers, and in 1950 the US began providing military aid to the French.<ref>http://www.historyplace.com/unitedstates/vietnam/index-1945.html</ref> This angered Vietnamese groups.<ref>Why Viet Nam?

CIA Paramilitary Operations Officers trained and led [[Hmong people|Hmong]] tribesmen in [[Laos]] and Vietnam. This effort was considered a significant success, and the actions of these officers were not known for several years. [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] was the air component of the CIA's paramilitary mission in Southeast Asia and was responsible for all combat, logistics and search and rescue operations in Laos and certain sections of Vietnam.<ref>[[Air America (airline)|Air America]] and The Ravens- by Chris Robbins&nbsp;<U+2014> Both are the history of CIA/IAD's war in Laos, providing biographies and details on such CIA Paramilitary Officers as Wil Green, Tony Poe, Jerry Daniels, Howie Freeman, Bill Lair, and the pilots, ground crew and support personnel managed by IAD/SOG/AIR BRANCH under the proprietaries Bird Air, Southern Air Transport, China Air Transport and Air America-- and the U.S. Air Force forward air controllers (RAVENS) who were brought in under CIA/IAD command and control as "civilians" to support secret combat ops in Laos.</ref> The ethnic minority forces numbered in the tens of thousands and they conducted direct actions mission, led by Paramilitary Operations Officers, against the communist [[Pathet Lao]] forces and their North Vietnamese allies.<ref name='Southworth'/>

Elements of SAD were seen in the CIA's [[Phoenix Program]]. One component of the Phoenix Program was involved in the capture and killing of suspected [[Viet Cong]] (National Liberation Front <U+2013> NLF) members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0595007384|title=The Phoenix Program|author=Douglas Valentine|year=2000}}</ref>  Between 1968 and 1972, the Phoenix Program captured 81,740 National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (NLF or Viet Cong) members, of whom 26,369 were killed. This was a large proportion of U.S. killings between 1969 and 1971. The program was also successful in destroying their infrastructure. By 1970, communist plans repeatedly emphasized attacking the government's "[[pacification]]" program and specifically targeted Phoenix agents. The NLF also imposed quotas. In 1970, for example, communist officials near [[Da Nang]] in northern [[South Vietnam]] instructed their agents to "kill 400 persons" deemed to be government "tyrant[s]" and to <U+201C>annihilate<U+201D> anyone involved with the "pacification" program. Several North Vietnamese officials have made statements about the effectiveness of Phoenix.<ref>http://usacac.army.mil/CAC/milreview/English/MarApr06/Andrade-Willbanks.pdf</ref><ref>^ Colby, William; Peter Forbath (1978) (extract concerning Gladio stay-behind operations in Scandinavia).

MAC-V SOG ([[Studies and Observations Group]]) (which was originally named the Special Operations Group, but was changed for cover purposes), was created and active during the [[Vietnam War]]. While CIA was just one part of MAC-V SOG, it did have operational control of some of the programs. Many of the military members of MAC-V SOG joined the CIA after their military service. The legacy of MAC-V SOG continues within SAD's Special Operations Group.<ref>''Shooting at the Moon'' by Roger Warner, The history of CIA/IAD'S 15-year involvement in conducting the secret war in Laos, 1960<U+2013>1975, and the career of CIA PMCO (paramilitary case officer) Bill Lair.</ref>

===Maritime activities against the USSR===
In 1973, SAD/SOG and the CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology built and deployed the [[USNS Glomar Explorer (T-AG-193)]], a large deep-sea salvage ship, on a secret operation. This operation was called [[Project Azorian]] (erroneously called [[Project Jennifer]] by the press).<ref name="Drew, 1998 p.196">Sontag and Drew, ''Blind Man's Bluff.''

===Nicaragua===
In 1979, the U.S.-backed [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]] dictatorship in [[Nicaragua]] fell to the socialist [[Sandinistas]]. Once in power, the Sandinistas disbanded the [[Nicaraguan National Guard]], who had committed many human rights abuses, and arrested and executed some of its members. Other former National Guard members helped to form the backbone of the Nicaraguan Counterrevolution or [[Contras|Contra]]. SAD/SOG paramilitary teams were deployed to train and lead these forces against the Sandinista government. These paramilitary activities were based in [[Honduras]] and [[Costa Rica]]. Direct military aid by the United States was eventually forbidden by the [[Boland Amendment]] of the Defense Appropriations Act of 1983. The Boland Amendment was extended in October 1984 to forbid action by not only the Defense Department, but also to include the Central Intelligence Agency.<ref>Theodore Draper. A Very Thin Line: The Iran-Contra Affair. New York: Hill and Wang</ref><ref name='Woodward 1987'>Bob Woodward (1987) VEIL: The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981<U+2013>1987. Simon and Schuster</ref>

The Boland Amendment was a compromise because the [[U.S. Democratic Party]] did not have enough votes for a comprehensive ban on military aid. It covered only appropriated funds spent by intelligence agencies. Some of Reagan's national security officials used non-appropriated money of the National Security Council (NSC) to circumvent the Amendment. NSC officials sought to arrange funding by third-parties. These efforts resulted in the [[Iran-Contra Affair]] of 1987, which concerned Contra funding through the proceeds of arms sales to the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]. No court ever made a determination whether Boland covered the NSC and on the grounds that it was a prohibition rather than a criminal statute, no one was indicted for violating it. Congress later resumed aid to the Contras, totaling over $300&nbsp;million. The Contra war ended when the Sandinistas were voted out of power by a war-weary populace in 1990.<ref name='Woodward 1987'/><ref>Riesenfeld, Stefan A. (January 1987).

===Somalia===
[[Image:LocationSomalia.svg|thumb|Location of Somalia]]
SAD sent in teams of Paramilitary Operations Officers into [[Somalia]] prior to the [[Unified Task Force|U.S. intervention]] in 1992. On December 23, 1992, Paramilitary Officer [[Intelligence Star#Larry N. Freedman|Larry Freedman]] became the first casualty of the conflict in Somalia. Freedman was a former Army [[Delta Force]] operator who had served in every conflict that the U.S. was involved in, both officially and unofficially, since Vietnam.<ref name="arlingtoncemetery.net">{{cite web|author=Michael Robert Patterson |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/lnfreedman.htm |title=Lawrence N.

In June 2006, the [[Islamic Courts Union]] seized control of southern Somalia, including the country's capital [[Mogadishu]], prompting the [[Ethiopian government]] to send in troops to try to protect the transitional government. In December, the Islamic Courts warned [[Ethiopia]] they would declare war if Ethiopia did not remove all its troops from Somalia. [[Sheikh Sharif Ahmed]], leader of the Islamic Courts, called for a [[jihad]], or holy war, against Ethiopia and encouraged foreign Muslim fighters to come to Somalia.

===Afghanistan===
[[File:Hamid Karzai with American Special Forces.PNG|thumb|right| [[Hamid Karzai]] with Special Forces and CIA Paramilitary in late 2001.]] During the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] in the 1980s, Paramilitary Operations Officers were instrumental in training, equipping and sometimes leading [[Mujaheddin]] forces against the [[Red Army]]. Although the CIA in general and a Texas congressman named [[Charles Wilson (Texas politician)|Charlie Wilson]] in particular, have received most of the attention, the key architect of this strategy was [[Michael G. Vickers]]. Vickers was a young Paramilitary Operations Officer from SAD/SOG. The CIA's efforts have been given credit for assisting in ending the [[Soviet]] occupation of [[Afghanistan]].<ref name="Crile 2003">{{cite book |first=George |last=Crile |title=Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of the Largest Covert Operation in History |publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press |year=2003 |isbn=0871138549}}</ref>

SAD paramilitary teams were active in Afghanistan in the 1990s in clandestine operations to locate and kill or capture [[Osama Bin Laden]]. These teams planned several operations, but did not receive the order to execute from President [[Bill Clinton]] because the available intelligence did not guarantee a successful outcome weighed against the extraordinary risk to the SAD/SOG teams that would execute the mission.<ref name='Coll 2004'/> These efforts did however build many of the relationships that would prove essential in the 2001 [[U.S. Invasion of Afghanistan]].<ref name='Coll 2004'/>

In 2001, SAD units were the first U.S. forces to enter Afghanistan. Their efforts organized the [[Afghan Northern Alliance]] for the subsequent arrival of [[United States Special Operations Command|USSOCOM]] forces.

The [[Washington Post]] stated in an editorial by [[John Lehman]] in 2006:

:"What made the Afghan campaign a landmark in the U.S. Military's history is that it was prosecuted by Special Operations forces from all the services, along with Navy and Air Force tactical power, operations by the Afghan Northern Alliance and the CIA were equally important and fully integrated. No large Army or Marine force was employed".<ref>Washington Post Editorial, John Lehman former Secretary of the Navy, October 2008</ref>

In a 2008 [[New York Times]] book review of ''Horse Soldiers'', a book by [[Doug Stanton]] about the invasion of Afghanistan, [[Bruce Barcott]] wrote:

Also in 2009, General [[Stanley McChrystal]], the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, planned to request an increase in teams of CIA operatives, including their elite paramilitary officers, to join with U.S. military special operations forces.

He is well known in CIA lore as "the man who saved [[Hamid Karzai]]'s life when the CIA led the effort to oust the Taliban from power in 2001". President Karzai is said to be greatly indebted to this officer and was pleased when the officer was named chief of station again. According to interviews with several senior officials, this officer "was uniformly well-liked and admired. A career paramilitary officer, he came to the CIA after several years in an elite Marine unit".<ref>{{cite web|author=Page 2 of 3 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/hed-cias-influence-wanes-afghanistan-war-intelligence-officials/story?id=9879696&page=2 |title=Page 2: CIA'S Influence Wanes in Afghanistan War, Say Intelligence Officials DEK: Officials Cite Agency's Losing Battle Over Station Chief Job as Evidence of Military's New Dominance By MARK SCHONE <U+2013> ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=February 19, 2010 |accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2010/07/23/ST2010072306082.html?sid=ST2010072306082 | work=The Washington Post | first=Greg | last=Jaffe | title=Gen.

SAD Paramilitary teams entered Iraq before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 invasion]]. Once on the ground they prepared the battle space for the subsequent arrival of U.S. military forces. SAD teams then combined with U.S. Army Special Forces (on a team called the Northern Iraq Liaison Element or NILE).<ref name='Woodward 2004'/> This team organized the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[Peshmerga]] for the subsequent U.S.-led invasion. This joint team combined in Operation Viking Hammer to defeat [[Ansar al-Islam]], a [[Islamist]] group allied to al-Qaeda, which several battle-hardened fighters from Afghanistan had joined after the fall of the Taliban, in a battle for control over the northeast of Iraq <U+2013> a battle that turned out being one of the "most intense battles of Special Forces since Vietnam".<ref name="usnews.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/041018/18excerpt.htm |title=A firefight in the mountains: Operation Viking Hammer was one for the record books <U+2013> US News and World Report |publisher=Usnews.com |accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref>  This battle was for an entire territory that was completely occupied by Ansar al-Islam and was executed prior to the invasion in February 2003.

SAD/SOG teams also conducted high risk special reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines to identify senior leadership targets. These missions led to the initial assassination attempts against [[Iraqi President]] [[Saddam Hussein]] and his key generals. Although the initial [[air strike]] against Hussein was unsuccessful in killing the dictator, it was successful in effectively ending his ability to command and control his forces. Other strikes against key generals were successful and significantly degraded the command's ability to react to and maneuver against the U.S.-led invasion force.<ref name='Woodward 2004'/><ref>Behind lines, an unseen war, Faye Bowers, Christian Science Monitor, April 2003.</ref> SAD operations officers were also successful in convincing key Iraqi army officers to surrender their units once the fighting started and/or not to oppose the invasion force.<ref name='Tucker 2008'/>

NATO member [[Turkey]] refused to allow its territory to be used by the U.S. Army's 4th Infantry Division for the invasion. As a result, the SAD/SOG, U.S. Army Special Forces joint teams, the Kurdish Peshmerga and the [[173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team|173d Airborne Brigade]] were the entire northern force against the Iraqi army during the invasion. Their efforts kept the 13 Divisions of the Iraqi Army in place to defend against the Kurds rather allowing them to contest the coalition force coming from the south.<ref name="usnews.com"/> This combined U.S. Special Operations and Kurdish force defeated the Iraqi army.<ref name='Woodward 2004'/> Four members of the SAD/SOG team received CIA's rare [[Intelligence Star]] for "extraordinary heroism".<ref name='Tucker 2008'/>

The mission that captured Saddam Hussein was called "[[Operation Red Dawn]]". It was planned and carried out by JSOC's Delta Force and SAD/SOG teams (together called [[Task Force 121]]). The operation eventually included around 600 soldiers from the 1st Brigade of the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]].<ref name="Iraq War 2004">'Black ops' shine in Iraq War, VFW Magazine, Feb, 2004, Tim Dyhouse.</ref><ref>"Saddam 'caught like a rat' in a hole".

"They can't be denied a role anymore."<ref name="Iraq War 2004"/>

CIA paramilitary units continued to team up with the JSOC in Iraq and in 2007 the combination created a lethal force many credit with having a major impact in the success of "[[the Surge]]".

These operations would be against [[Quds Force]], the commando arm of the [[Iranian Revolutionary Guard]], public and private sector strategic targets, and <U+201C>high-value targets<U+201D> in the war on terror. Also enrolled to support CIA objectives were the [[Jundallah]], [[Mujahideen-e-Khalq]], known in the West as the M.E.K.,and the [[Baluchis]] insurgents.<ref name="newyorker.com">Hersh, Seymour (July 7, 2008).

==Worldwide mission==
[[File:Khalid Shaikh Mohammed after capture.jpg|thumb|[[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] after his capture]] The [[CIA]] has always had a Special Activities Division, which secretly carries out special operations mission. However, since September 11, 2001 the US government has relied much more on SAD/SOG because fighting terrorists does not usually involve fighting other armies. Rather, it involves secretly moving in and out of countries like [[Pakistan]], Iran and [[Somalia]] where the American military is not legally allowed to operate.<ref>C.I.A.

In 2002, the [[George W.

The list includes key al Qaeda leaders like [[Osama bin Laden]] (deceased) and his chief deputy, [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], as well as other principal figures from al Qaeda and affiliated groups.

Their efforts have already resulted in 15 [[Arab]] militants linked to al Qaeda being captured.<ref name="timesonline.co.uk"/>

The SAD/SOG teams have also been active in the [[Philippines]], where 1,200 U.S. military advisers helped to train local soldiers in "counter-terrorist operations" against [[Abu Sayyaf]], a radical Islamist group suspected of ties with al Qaeda. Little is known about this U.S. covert action program, but some analysts believe that "the CIA<U+2019>s paramilitary wing, the Special Activities Division (SAD), has been allowed to pursue terrorist suspects in the Philippines on the basis that its actions will never be acknowledged".<ref name="timesonline.co.uk"/>

On July 14, 2009, several newspapers reported that DCIA [[Leon Panetta]] was briefed on a CIA program that had not been briefed to the oversight committees in Congress. Panetta cancelled the initiative and reported its existence to Congress and the President. The program consisted of teams of SAD paramilitary officers organized to execute [[targeted killing]] operations against al Qaeda operatives around the world in any country. According to the Los Angeles Times, DCIA Panetta "has not ruled out reviving the program".<ref name="CIA Secret Program PM"/> There is some question as to whether former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] instructed the CIA not to inform Congress.<ref>CIA Had Plan To Assassinate Qaeda Leaders, [[Mark Mazzetti]] and Shane Scott, New York Times, July 14, 2009, A1</ref> Per senior intelligence officers, this program was an attempt to avoid the civilian casualties that can occur during predator drone stikes using [[hellfire missiles]].<ref>CIA Plan Envisioned Hit Teams Killing al Qaeda Leaders, Siobahn Gorman, Wall Street Journal, July 14, 2009, A3</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/04/29/this_week_at_war_company_men |title=This Week at War: Company Men <U+2013> By Robert Haddick |publisher=Foreign Policy |accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref>

==Innovations in special operations==
[[File:Fulton system1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Fulton system in use]]The [[Fulton surface-to-air recovery system]] (STARS) is a system developed in the early 1950s by [[CIA]] paramilitary officers for retrieving persons on the ground from a [[MC-130E Combat Talon I]] aircraft. It uses a harness and a self-inflating balloon that carries an attached lift line. An MC-130E engages the line with its V-shaped yoke and the individual is reeled on board.<ref>Ihttps://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol52no2/iac/seven-days-in-the-arctic.htmlnsert footnote text here</ref> [[Project COLDFEET]] was a very successful mission in 1962 in which two military officers parachuted into a remote abandoned Soviet site in the Arctic.

As an OSS officer, Berg was parachuted into [[Yugoslavia]] to gather intelligence on [[Yugoslav Front of World War II|resistance groups]] the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] was considering supporting. He was then sent on a mission to Italy, where he interviewed various [[physicist]]s concerning the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[German nuclear energy project|nuclear program]] to assess whether they should be killed. After [[World War II]], Berg worked for the OSS's successor, the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].

*[[William Colby]] was another famous OSS Paramilitary Officer<U+2014>although Colby never served in SAD/SOG as a PMOO. Colby parachuted behind enemy lines into France and Norway during World War II. He was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for his actions. After the war, Colby went to Columbia Law School and practiced law in [[William Joseph Donovan|William Donovan]]'s law firm. He became bored quickly and accepted a position with the CIA, where he ended up serving in many important positions culminating in his becoming the [[Director of Central Intelligence]] in 1973. Colby died in 1996 in a boating accident. The circumstances surrounding his death were viewed as suspicious by many.<ref>Colby, William; James McCargar (1989).

*[[Douglas Mackiernan]] was the first of over 80 officers of the CIA to be killed in the line of duty. Publicly working under diplomatic cover as a State Department employee, he worked as a covert intelligence officer for the CIA in its earliest days after its creation in 1947. His assignment in [[<U+00DC>r<U+00FC>mqi|Tihwa]], [[Sinkiang]] included the collection of intelligence about Russian nuclear activities in Western China and Chinese intentions on the Korean Peninsula. Mackiernan was killed in April, 1950 accidentally by [[Tibet]]an outposts as he was trying to flee into Tibet with information on these intentions.<ref>Gup, Ted (2000).

*[[John T. Downey|John Downey]] and [[Richard Fecteau]] were 25 year-old Agency Paramilitary Officers assigned to China operations and based in Japan when the Civil Air Transport (CAT) C-47 in which they were working was shot down by the Communist Chinese in November 1952.  Downey and Fecteau were enroute to retrieve an agent inside China at the time of the incident.  Both officers survived the crash but the CAT pilot and co-pilot Norman Shwartz and Robert Snoddy perished.  The C-47 was equipped with a "cow catcher" rigged to the nose designed to snare a cable attached by harness to the agent on the ground and sent aloft by a small inflated baloon.  Once the aircraft snagged the cable, the agent would be lifted into the air and the cable would be cranked up by Downey and Fecteau to retrieve the agent into the cargo bay of the C-47.  Unbeknown to CIA, the agent network had been compromised by the Chinese, who laid a trap for the retrieval team.  Downey had trained this particular agent and had a personal interest in the rescue mission.  Downey and Fecteau were presumed dead until 1954, when Red China publicly announced that the two had been captured and convicted of espionage.  Downey received a life sentence, while Fecteau was sentenced to 20 years.  Despite protests from Washington that Downey and Fecteau were "Department of the Army civilian employees," both endured brutal interrogation and years of solitary confinement.  In 1971, following President Richard Nixon's overtures to establish diplomatic relations with China, Nixon acknowledged the CIA affiliation of both men and Fecteau was released. Two years later, John Downey walked across the Wo-Lu Bridge from China into British Hong Kong.  During their two decades of imprisonment, CIA placed their salaries in escrow accounts, with interest, granted both men periodic promotions on schedule with their Agency peers, maintained their life and health insurance and assigned Case Officers to look after the welfare of their families. Downey and Fecteau were awarded medals in a ceremony at Langley years after their release.  Richard Fecteau became the Athletic Director at Boston University, his alma mater, retiring in 1989.  John Downey entered the Connecticutt Bar and became a judge.  The New Haven Connecticutt court house is named in his honor.

Poe was involved in training indigenous forces from Tibet in the early 1950s, landed by sea in Sumatra in 1955 with equally legendary SAD officer Tom Fosmire to command rebel Indonesian troops. He went to Laos in the early 1960s, where he served with distinction, including several years at a remote mountain post near the Chinese border. He is sometimes labeled as the model for the character Colonel Kurtz in the 1979 film [[Apocalypse Now]].<ref name="feettofire"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Covert Ops: The CIAS's Secret War in Laos |first=James E |last=Parker |year=1995}}</ref> Poe was awarded the [[Intelligence Star]] twice, a very rare occurrence.<ref>Ehrlich, Richard S.

* [[James (Jim) Glerum]].  James Glerum was among the second generation of Agency  Paramilitary Case Officers and he played an integral role in paramilitary operations in China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Laos. Widely respected by subordinates and superiors alike, he rose to become the Chief of the Special Activities Division and was a key figure in the division's post-Vietnam era professional development and modernization.  Mr. Glerum continued to act in a consulting capacity following his retirement and was also involved in a successful program to collect and organize an enormous body of files and records documenting the 60 plus year history of the Special Activities Division.

* Wilbur "Will" Green. A former Army Special Forces Sergeant, Will Green went to Laos as a Paramilitary Case Officer in the 1960s and served with distinction. Known by his callsign "Black Lion," Green remained in the most dangerous forward Hmong outposts even when ordered to evacuate. From there he directed Hmong troops in heavy combat and was wounded more than once. Ironically, he succumbed to a liver fluke after several tours in-country.

* Tom Fosmire. Fosmire joined SOG in the 1950s and was given responsibility (along with Tony Poe) in training Tibetan tribesmen to fight against the Chinese Communists in the early part of his career.  The training occurred first at a base on Saipan in the Marianas islands but was later moved to a colder mountainous climate at Camp Hale, Colorado.  One battalion was trained at the Farm, near Williamsburg, Virginia.  After the Tibetan operation concludes, Fosmire llanded with Tony Poe in Sumatra, Indonesia to supply and train mutinous forces there in an effort by the Eisenhower administration to destabilize the communist-leaning regime of Sukarno. He and Poe were evacuated from Sumatra by US Navy submarine when the troops they were training fled to the mountains. In the 1980s, Fosmire served in El Salvador and Honduras, training Nicaraguan rebel troops opposed to the Sandanista government.

* [[Howard Freeman]]. In 1972, Freeman was assigned to command a remote outpost at Phu Pa Thi (Site 85) north of the CIA base at Long Tieng, Laos where the US Air Force had installed a strategic radar system to enable US bombers to launch more accurate raids on North Vietnam. When the Vietnamese overran the {{convert|3000|ft|m|adj=on}} mountain outpost, Freeman and a small security detachment of Hmong rushed to the top of the mountain where they engaged in close combat with the enemy, resulting in Freeman's wounding. Freeman was carrying only a sawed-off shotgun and a side arm when he was hit in the back of the leg. Unable by that time to rescue any of the Air Force personnel, Freeman, and his Hmong team were ordered off the mountain. In his later career, Freeman served with distinction in the Agency's Counterterrorism Center, where he handled some of the CTC's most dangerous assignments.

* [[Dick Holm|Richard (Dick) Holm]]. After serving an initial two-year tour upcountry in Laos, former US Army intelligence officer Holm was assigned to the Congo. Flying as back-seat observer in an agency T-28, he was seriously wounded when the aircraft crash-landed in a remote location hundreds of miles from any large population center. Holm, who sustained 3rd degree burns over his face and much of his upper torso, survived and was evacuated after almost a month in the care of local natives. After a lengthy recovery of several years, Holm went on to a distinguished career as a CIA Case Officer, finishing his career as Chief of Station in a Western European country.

* [[William Lair]]. Bill Lair was among the most distinguished officers ever to have served in SOG. In 1952 he was sent to Bangkok to work with the Thai Government in development of a counter-insurgency program. Lair developed, trained and led the Thai Parachute Reconnaissance Units (PARU), a highly effective and elite force, which later engaged in combat in Laos. After some 8 years, Lair was reassigned as Chief of Operations in Laos and almost single-handedly developed the Hmong indigenous forces there to combat the Communist Pathet Lao and the two main-force Vietnamese infantry divisions supporting them. With fellow officers like [[Vint Lawrence]] and [[Tony Poe]], the Hmong forces developed into an effective army that kept the Pathet Lao from seizing Vientianne and tied up the two Vietnamese divisions for 12 years<U+2014>departing country only after the US military evacuated South Vietnam.

* Gar Thorsrud.  Thorsrud was a Montana pilot and smoke jumper who was initially contracted by CIA to fly aircraft for the Tibetan insertion operation, encrypted STBARNUM, in the early 1950s,  He was subsequently offered a staff position in SOG and, together with Major (later Brigadier General) Heinie Aderholt<U+2014>who had been seconded to the Agency from the US Air Force<U+2014>stood up a separate paramilitary air wing<U+2014>later formalized as Air Branch.  SOG/Air Branch (and Thorsrud) subsequently played a major role in virtually every Agency covert action in the Third World during the cold war and beyond.  In 1956, Thorsrud established an air operations base carved out of the jungle in a western pacific location and from there he oversaw air delivery of men and supplies to support President Eisenhower's program to de-stabilize the Sukarno regime in Indonesia.  When the Soviets abandoned an arctic weather and listening station in the mid-1960s, after the ice pack it was built on broke adrift, Thorsrud organized the air assets for a remarkable joint CIA-US Navy operation that put 2 officers on the floating ice flow to recover a treasure trove of documents, instruments and equipment abandoned there by the Soviets.  Thorsrud then successfully extracted the two officers by means of a "cow catcher" attached to a converted B-17 bomber that snagged a line attached to an inflated baloon and connected to the men by harness.  This incredible feat in the arctic slowly leaked out and became the basis for the spy thriller film "Ice Station Zebra."  During the early years of China operations, Air Branch assumed control of several private Asian cargo airlines and turned them into CIA proprietary companies.  These included Civil Air Transport (CAT), purchased from its founder General Claire Chennaul, as well as Air America, and lesser known air props such as Bird Air, and Southern Air Transport.

* [[George Bacon]]. After serving several tours in Laos as a PMOO, Bacon left the Agency and went to Angola, where he was killed in action while working as an independent contractor.

* [[Grayston Lynch|Grayston "Gray" Lynch]]. Lynch and William "Rip" Robertson led the CIA-trained Cuban exile brigade at the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. Lynch had been a career Army infantry officer prior to joining the Agency. He and Robertson were the only Americans who actually went ashore with their charges; both were ordered off the beach and watched in desperation as the Kennedy administration refused to provide air cover for the Cuban brigade ashore. Lynch's memoirs provide one of the few true ground-truth account of the Bay of Pigs operation.

* [[William "Rip" Robertson]]. A former US Marine, Rip Robertson had served in SOG for some 10 years before being fired after a sabotage operation he was in charge of in Nicaragua went wrong, resulting in the accidental sinking of a British vessel. Undeterred, Robertson went into private business in Nicaragua, and when the CIA was looking for remote bases to train the Cuban exile 2506 brigade for an invasion of Cuba, Robertson was quietly brought back on board at Langley to engage in training the Cubans at some of his Nicaraguan locations. On D-Day, Robertson and Grayston Lynch went ashore with the Cuban 2506 Brigade and were engaged in close combat with Castro's forces. Both were ordered off the beach and watched, frustrated, as Castro's Air Force<U+2014>unfettered by President Kennedy's fatal decision to cease air support for the 2506 Brigade<U+2014>moved in and destroyed the 2506 Brigade and several of its support vessels at the Bay of Pigs.

*William [[Billy Waugh]], Sergeant Major, U.S. Army-Retired (born December, 1929), is a highly decorated American [[United States Army Special Forces|Special Forces]] soldier and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] Paramilitary Operations Officer who served in the [[United States military]] and CIA special operations for more than fifty years. Billy Waugh was a Special Forces soldier and served in the [[Korean War]]. When the Vietnam War began Waugh was a member of [[5th Special Forces Group]] and joined the [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group]] (MACV-SOG). While working for US ARMY MACV-SOG (NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH SAD/SOG), Waugh helped train Vietnamese and [[Cambodia]]n forces in [[unconventional warfare]] tactics primarily directed against the [[North Vietnamese Army]] operating along the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. He received a [[Silver Star]], four [[Bronze Star]]s for Valor and eight [[Purple Heart]]s. Waugh joined the CIA as a low-level and limited duty employee in 1961, however when the Agency re-tooled SAD in the early 1970s to require all Paramilitary staff to either take training as formal Case Officers or lose their employment, Waugh never received his professional certification as a Core Collector and left the Agency along with some 300 similar employees at the end of the Vietnam War. His later work for the Agency in the 1980s was as a surveillance team member for CTC<U+2014>a low-level para-professional position that also included dozens of ex-cops, Army officers, house wives and veterans of assorted other common occupations.. The most significant of these surveillance operations was in Sudan and included spotting [[Carlos the Jackal]] and [[Osama bin Laden]]. At the age of 71, Waugh asked to be assigned to one of the later SAD/SOG Jawbreaker teams to enter Afghanistan, but he was accepted only with great reluctance by both SAD and CTC due not only to his age but also due to his lack of Case Officer training and certification.  In his self-serving autobiography, Waugh admits that he was unable to withstand both the rigors and the climate of Afghanistan and he himself requested to be sent home well short of tour.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fury |first=Dalton |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060564105 |title=Hunting the Jackal: A Special Forces and CIA Soldier's Fifty Years on the Frontlines of the War Against Terrorism 2004 |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780307345455 |title=Robert Young Pelton,',Licenced to Kill: Hired Guns in the War on Terror (Crown, September 2006) |publisher=Randomhouse.com |accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref> PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF BILLY WAUGH'S SUDANESE AND AFGHANISTAN SERVICE WITH CIA.

*[[Johnny Micheal Spann]], the first American casualty in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]], was a [[Paramilitary]] Officer in Special Activities Division and former United States Marine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/jmspann.htm|title=Johnny Micheal Spann, Captain, [[United States Marine Corps]], Central Intelligence Agency Officer|publisher=[[Arlington National Cemetery]]}}</ref>  Officer Spann was killed in a prison uprising at the Qala-i-Jangi compound at [[Mazari Sharif]].

Officer Spann was awarded the [[Intelligence Star]] for his actions.<ref>Johnny Micheal Spann, Captain, United States Marine Corps, Central Intelligence Agency Officer".  While Spann was highly regarded by his SOG colleagues, his notoriety as a "famous" paramilitary officer derives not from his good service or tragic death, but primarily because his family refused to honor his cover status, making his death a cause celebe'.  Faced with an uncooperative family, the Director of CIA chose to publicly acknowledge Spann's employment with the Agency, however Mike was just the first of many many more paramilitary officers to pay the ultimate price in Iraq and Afghanistan.  All the rest have remained as anonymous in death as they were in life.

* Ernest "Chick" Tsikerdanos. A veteran of OSS, 82nd Airborne Sergeant Chick Tsikerdanos served with Chiang Kai Shek in Kunming, China and later in Burma with the famous OSS Detachment 101. Tsikerdanos had a close relationship with General and Madame Chiang and was held in high esteem by them and other Chinese Nationalist leaders. On the last day of the war, August 9, 1945, Tsikerdanos was wounded in the right eye by a Japanese mortar shell fragment when his battalion of Burmese irregulars were ambushed while moving across a valley. After leaving the service, Tsikerdanos joined CIA and was assigned to Taiwan where he ran cross-channel reconnaissance and harassment operations into Red China from Nationalist-held islands. A legend in his own lifetime, he later served multiple tours in Greece, and later was entrusted with the difficult assignment of cleaning up the large mess of internal "dirt" files collected over twenty-five years by the paranoid former CI Chief<U+2014>James Jesus Angleton<U+2014>after Angleton's forced retirement. After his own retirement, Tsikerdanos returned to CIA as a Contract Case Officer, working with distinction in the Agency's Counterterrorism Center for several years. He was personally engaged against some of the most dangerous terrorist suspects in Europe. Ernie Tsikerdanos is warmly remembered for his outrageous sense of humor, his integrity and his trade-mark stogie, which he rarely went anywhere without.

*[[William (Bill) Young]] was the son of American missionaries and was born in Thailand and raised there and in Burma.  Young's father, Harold, aided CIA with intelligence gathering trips into Southern China during the late 1940s and 1950s.  Son Bill followed in his father's footsteps by joining CIA following a hitch in the US Army in the early 1960s.  Young's knowledge of the region and command of indigenous languages made him an ideal candidate for service in the CIA's paramilitary wing--then known as the Special Operations Division.  Young-- along with Bill Lair, Vint Lawrence, Tony Poe, Jim Glerum and others-- was a key officer involved in the formation of the guerrilla army of Hhmong (Meo) hill tribesmen and in using that force to mount harrassment and interdiction operations against the Communist Pathet Lao forces and their North Vietnamese sponsors.  In 1968, Mr. Young strongly objected to proposals to widen the conflict with the introduction of US military resources-- including widespread US Air Force carpet bombing in the Plain Des Jarres region of northcentral Laos and along the Bolovens Plateau and the Ho Chi Minh trail in southern Laos.  Young's strident objections to this new US strategy resulted in the unfortunate termination of his employment.  The loss of Bill Young was a significant blow to the program, for few of his peers possessed such deep insight into the culture of the locals.   Mr. Young remained in Thailand for the rest of his life, with the exception of a brief period of a few months when he worked in the corporate world in the United States.  He soon returned to Thailand.  Serious health problems beset him during his final years and he died by his own hand on April 1, 2011.  When Thai Police discovered the body of Mr. Young, they discovered a semiautomatic pistol in his right hand and a Crucifix in his left hand.


* On October 25, 2003, paramilitary officers Christopher Mueller and William "Chief" Carlson were killed while conducting an operation to kill/capture high level [[al-Qa'ida]] leaders near [[Shkin, Paktika|Shkin]], Afghanistan.

==Famous political action officers==
*[[Virginia Hall]] Goillot started as the only female paramilitary officer in the OSS. She shot herself in the leg while hunting in Turkey in 1932, which was then amputated below the knee. She parachuted into France to organize the resistance with her prosthesis strapped to her body. She was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]]. She married an OSS officer named Paul Goillot and the two joined the CIA as paramilitary operations officers in SAD. Once aboard, Mrs. Goillot made her mark as a political action officer playing significant roles in the Guatemala and Guyana operations. These operations involved the covert removal of the governments of these two countries, as directed by the President of the United States.<ref>Safe For Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA, John Prados, 2006 page 10</ref>

*[[E. Howard Hunt]] (October 9, 1918 <U+2013> January 23, 2007) was an Ivy league educated Naval officer who joined the CIA in 1949 after serving with the OSS in World War II. Hunt was a political action officer in what came to be called their Special Activities Division.<ref>Safe For Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA, John Prados, 2006 page xxii</ref>  He became station chief in Mexico City in 1950, and supervised [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]], who worked for the CIA in Mexico during the period 1951<U+2013>1952. Buckley, another SAD political action specialist, only served briefly in the CIA and went on to be considered the father of the modern American conservative movement. Buckley and Hunt remained lifelong friends.<ref>William F.

* [[David Atlee Phillips]] Perhaps the most famous propaganda officer ever to serve in CIA, Phillips began his career as a journalist and amateur actor in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He joined the Agency in the 1950s and was one of the chief architects of the operation to overthrow Communist president Arbenz in Guatemala in 1954. He was later heavily engaged as a principal member of the Bay of Pigs Task Force at Langley, and in subsequent anti-Castro operations throughout the 1960s. He founded the Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO) after successfully contesting a libel suit against him. His book, "The Night Watch" is a must for anyone studying CIA operations in the 1950s and 1960s.

*[[Kermit Roosevelt, Jr.]] (February 16, 1916 <U+2013> June 8, 2000), was a political action officer in SAD who coordinated the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s (CIA) [[Operation Ajax]], which orchestrated the coup d<U+2019><U+00E9>tat against Iran's [[Mohammed Mossadegh]] and returned [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the Shah of Iran, to Iran's [[Peacock Throne]] in August 1953. He was also the grandson of American president [[Theodore Roosevelt]].
