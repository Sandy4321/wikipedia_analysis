In [[geometry]], the '''truncated cuboctahedron''' is an [[Archimedean solid]]. It has 12 [[Square (geometry)|square]] faces, 8 regular [[hexagon]]al faces, 6 regular [[octagon]]al faces, 48 vertices and 72 edges. Since each of its faces has [[point symmetry]] (equivalently, 180<U+00B0> [[rotation]]al symmetry), the truncated cuboctahedron is a [[zonohedron]].

==Cartesian coordinates==
The [[Cartesian coordinates]] for the vertices of a truncated cuboctahedron having edge length&nbsp;2 and centered at the origin are all permutations of:
:(<U+00B1>1, <U+00B1>(1+<U+221A>2), <U+00B1>(1+2<U+221A>2))

==Area and volume==
The area ''A'' and the volume ''V'' of the truncated cuboctahedron of edge length ''a'' are:
:<math>A = 12\left(2+\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}\right) a^2 \approx 61.7551724a^2</math>
:<math>V = \left(22+14\sqrt{2}\right) a^3 \approx 41.7989899a^3.</math>

==Vertices==
To derive the number of vertices, we note that each vertex is the meeting point of a square, hexagon, and octagon.  
*Each of the 12 squares with their 4 vertices contribute 48 vertices because 12 <U+00D7> 4 = 48.
*Each of the 8 hexagons with their 6 vertices contribute 48 vertices because 8 <U+00D7> 6 = 48.
*Each of the 6 octagons with their 8 vertices contribute 48 vertices because 6 <U+00D7> 8 = 48.

Therefore, there may seem to exist {{nowrap|48 + 48 + 48 {{=}} 144}} vertices. However, we have over-counted the vertices thrice since a square, hexagon, and octagon meet at each vertex. Consequently, we divide 144 by 3 to correct for our over-counting: {{nowrap|144 / 3 {{=}} 48.}}

==Dual==
If the original truncated cuboctahedron has edge length 1, its dual [[disdyakis dodecahedron]] has edge lengths <math>\tfrac{2}{7}\scriptstyle{\sqrt{30-3\sqrt{2}}}</math>, <math>\tfrac{3}{7}\scriptstyle{\sqrt{6(2+\sqrt{2})}}</math> and <math>\tfrac{2}{7}\scriptstyle{\sqrt{6(10+\sqrt{2})}}</math>.

==Uniform colorings==
There is only one [[uniform coloring]] of the faces of this polyhedron, one color for each face type.

A 2-uniform coloring also exists with alternately colored hexagons.

==Other names==
Alternate interchangeable names are:
*''Truncated cuboctahedron'' ([[Johannes Kepler]])
*''Rhombitruncated cuboctahedron'' ([[Magnus Wenninger]]<ref>{{Citation |last1=Wenninger |first1=Magnus |author1-link=Magnus Wenninger |title=Polyhedron Models |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-09859-5 |id={{MathSciNet|id=0467493}} |year=1974}} (Model 15, p. 29)</ref>)
*''Great rhombicuboctahedron'' (Robert Williams<ref>{{The Geometrical Foundation of Natural Structure (book)}} (Section 3-9, p. 82)</ref>)
*''Great rhombcuboctahedron'' (Peter Cromwell<ref>Cromwell, P.; [http://books.google.com/books?id=OJowej1QWpoC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA82#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Polyhedra''], CUP hbk (1997), pbk. (1999). (p. 82) </ref>)
*''Omnitruncated cube'' or ''cantitruncated cube'' ([[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]])

The name ''truncated cuboctahedron'', given originally by [[Johannes Kepler]], is a little misleading. If you [[truncation (geometry)|truncate]] a [[cuboctahedron]] by cutting the corners off, you do ''not'' get this uniform figure: some of the faces will be [[rectangle]]s. However, the resulting figure is [[topologically]] equivalent to a truncated cuboctahedron and can always be deformed until the faces are regular. 

The alternative name ''great rhombicuboctahedron'' refers to the fact that the 12 square faces lie in the same planes as the 12 faces of the [[rhombic dodecahedron]] which is dual to the cuboctahedron. Compare to [[small rhombicuboctahedron]].

One unfortunate point of confusion: There is a [[nonconvex uniform polyhedron]] by the same name. See [[nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron]].
==Orthogonal projections==
The truncated cuboctahedron has two special [[orthogonal projection]]s in the A<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> [[Coxeter plane]]s with [6] and [8] projective symmetry, and numerous [2] symmtries can be constructed from various projected planes relative to the polyhedron elements.

== Related polyhedra==
The truncated cuboctahedron is one of a family of uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.

{{Octahedral truncations}}

This polyhedron can be considered a member of a sequence of uniform patterns with vertex figure (4.6.2p) and [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]] {{CDD|node_1|p|node_1|3|node_1}}.  For ''p'' &lt; 6, the members of the sequence are [[Omnitruncation (geometry)|omnitruncated]] polyhedra ([[zonohedron]]s), shown below as spherical tilings. For ''p'' &gt; 6, they are tilings of the hyperbolic plane, starting with the [[truncated triheptagonal tiling]].
