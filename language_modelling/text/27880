'''''Geastrum welwitschii''''' is a species of [[fungus]] in the [[Geastraceae|earthstar family]]. When young and unopened, the [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] resemble small spheres lying in the soil. As the mushroom matures, the thick leathery outer layer of tissue (the [[peridium]]) splits star-like to form a number of fleshy arms, which curve downward to reveal the inner spore sac that contains the fertile tissue known as the [[gleba]]. The spore sac has a narrow grooved opening at the top where the spores are released. Fully expanded, the fruit bodies are up to {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|58|mm|in|abbr=on}} tall. First collected from Spain in the mid-1800s, the fungus is distributed in Europe, North America, and [[Bermuda]].

==Taxonomy==
[[image:Friedrich Welwitsch.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Friedrich Welwitsch]]
The fungus was first collected in Spain by the Austrian explorer and botanist [[Friedrich Welwitsch]].<ref name=Lloyd1907/> British mycologist [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] obtained the specimens and thought them to be ''[[Geastrum fimbriatum]]''. He sent a specimen to the French mycologist [[Camille Montagne]] in 1856, who named it ''Geaster Welwitschii'' (''Geaster'' is an [[orthographical variant]] of ''Geastrum'').<ref name=Demoulin1984/><ref name=Montagne1856/> [[Patricio Ponce de Le<U+00F3>n]] in his 1968 world [[monograph]] of ''Geastrum'', considered the species a [[wikt:fornicate|fornicate]] [[variety (botany)|variety]] of ''G. javanicum'', and described it as ''Geastrum javanicum'' var. ''welwitschii'';<ref name=PoncedeLeon1968/> this is now a [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]].<ref name="urlMycoBank: Geastrum javanicum var. welwitschii"/>

According to Stanek's infrageneric (ranks below the level of [[genus]]) concept of the genus ''[[Geastrum]]'', ''G.&nbsp;welwitschii'' is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Basimyceliata'', which includes species in which the outer part of the mycelial layer do not incorporate sand and encrusting debris. It is further classified in the subsection ''Laevistomata'' because its [[peristome]] (an opening at the top of the spore sac) is even to fibrillose (with [[wikt:fibril|fibrils]]).<ref name=Sunhede1989/>

==Description==
The mature fruit body of ''G.&nbsp;welwitschii'' is small to medium-sized, with a fornicate spore sac, meaning that the spore sac is raised into the air as the rays press down. Unlike some other earthstar fungi, the [[mycelium|mycelial]] layer does not encrust debris as the fruit body develops. The peristome is even, and has an indistinct boundary. The young fruit bodies just prior to opening are found near the surface of the ground, and are rounded, with or without an [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]], and attached to the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] with a basal [[mycelium|mycelial]] tuft or cord. The expanded fruit body is small to medium-sized. The fornicate exoperidium (outer [[peridium]]) has the upper, arched part (fibrous and pseudoparenchymatous layers) split to about the half-way point or more into 4<U+2013>7 rays. The mycelial cup is free (only attached at its base), with 4<U+2013>7 more or less well-developed lobes corresponding to the 4<U+2013>7 rays. The width of the fruit body is about {{convert|20|<U+2013>|35|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and in height about {{convert|40|<U+2013>|58|mm|in|abbr=on}} (including the 15<U+2013>20&nbsp;mm high mycelial cup). The diameter of the exoperidium is about {{convert|39|<U+2013>|72|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Sunhede1989/>

The pseudoparenchymatous layer (a layer of thin-walled, usually angular, randomly-arranged cells that are tightly packed) is initially beige, later brownish, in age dark brown, cracked and if moist reddish-brown. The fibrous layer is beige-colored, with its outer side free from the mycelial layer except at the tips of the rays. The mycelial layer has a beige brown to somewhat yellowish-brown, felted to tufted outer surface, darkening to reddish brown if moist. It is not encrusted with debris, but some debris and sand may adhere. The inner side is smooth, dull to somewhat glossy, and hazelnut brown.<ref name=Sunhede1989/>

The spore sac is [[stipe (mycology)|stalked]], and roughly spherical, with a diameter of about {{convert|8|<U+2013>|20|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The stalk is short but distinct, up to {{convert|1.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} high, light beige in color, and sometimes indistinctly developed. The endoperidium (inner peridium) is more or less smooth to the unaided eye, but densely protruding light to grayish-brown [[hypha]]l tips are present. The peristome is indistinctly delimited (without distinct boundaries), and the mouth area fibrillose. The [[wikt:columella|columella]] is not well-developed, and broadly club-shaped to columnar; in cross-section it is whitish to pale beige. The mature [[gleba]] is brown and powdery.<ref name=Sunhede1989/>

The [[spore]]s of ''Geastrum welwitschii'' are roughly spherical, sometimes contain an oil droplet, and measure 4.5<U+2013>5.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|<U+03BC>m]] in diameter. [[Scanning electron microscopy]] has revealed that the spore surface is covered with column-like processes, up to 0.45&nbsp;<U+03BC>m high, that may be more or less [[wikt:confluent|confluent]].<ref name=Sunhede1989/>

==Similar species==
[[image:Geastrum.jpg|thumb|right|234px|''Geastrum'' aff. ''welwitschii'' is found in [[Hawaii]].]]
''Geastrum welwitschii'' is [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] similar to ''[[Geastrum fornicatum|G.&nbsp;fornicatum]]'' in having fornicate, mostly 3<U+2013>6 rays, of exoperidia and a cup-shaped mycelial layer. ''Geastrum welwitschii'' is distinguished from ''G.&nbsp;fornicatum'' by its epigeal mycelial cup with a felted or tufted outer surface.<ref name=Sunhede1989/><ref name=Kasuya2009/>

''Geastrum welwitschii'' also has similar morphological characters to ''[[Geastrum minimum|G.&nbsp;minimum]]'' in having small fruit bodies, whitish spore sacs, and fibrillose peristomes. However ''G.&nbsp;welwitschii'' is differentiated from ''G.&nbsp;minimum'' by its fornicate, mostly 3<U+2013>6, rays of the exoperidia, and the mycelial layer that easily loosens from the fibrous layer to form a mycelial cup.<ref name=Coker1974/><ref name=Sunhede1989/> ''G.&nbsp;welwitschii'' is distinguished from ''[[Geastrum entomophilum|G.&nbsp;entomophilum]]'' by its dark and sessile endoperidium, and smaller spores (2.8<U+2013>3.5&nbsp;<U+03BC>m).<ref name=Fazolino2008/>

According to mycologists [[Done E. Hemmes|Hemmes]] and [[Daniel E. Desjardin|Desjardin]], the most common earthstar in the coastal ''[[Casuarina]]'' forests of [[Hawaii]] is a species "closely allied" with ''G.&nbsp;welwitschii'', which they name ''Geastrum'' aff. ''welwitschii''.{{#tag:ref|The term "aff." (for ''affinis'') indicates that the specimen or group of specimens is closely related to the named species, but shows features that suggest it is a different species.|group=nb}} It differs from the main species in its much coarser pyramidal warts on the exoperidial surface, a sessile and sac-shaped endoperidial body, and smaller spores. They likened the roughened outer surface of the exoperidium to [[lychee]] fruit.<ref name=Hemmes2002/>

==Habitat and distribution==
The fungus is [[saprobic]], and grows on the ground, in leaf litter, or on decomposing wood. It has been collected in Spain, [[South Carolina]], [[Florida]], and [[Bermuda]].<ref name=Sunhede1989/>
