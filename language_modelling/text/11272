Notable examples include two of the eight [[Bedside-films|''Bedside''-films]] and the six [[Zodiac-films|''Zodiac''-films]] from the 1970s, all of which were produced in Denmark and had many pornographic sex scenes, but were nevertheless considered mainstream films (they all had mainstream casts and crews, and premiered in mainstream cinemas).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jensen|first=Michael|date=November 2006|title=LEGITIMIZING ILLEGITIMACY: IDENTITY SPACES AND MARKETS FOR ILLEGITIMATE PRODUCTS|journal=Organizations & Markets Workshop|publisher=Chicago Booth|url=http://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/workshops/orgs-markets/docs/jensen-legitimacy.pdf}}</ref> The last of these films, ''Agent 69 Jensen i Skyttens tegn'', was made in 1978.

==Films with non-simulated sexual activity==
The following mainstream films have scenes with verified real sexual activity, meaning actors or actresses are filmed engaging in actual [[coitus]] or performing related sexual acts such as [[fellatio]] and [[cunnilingus]]. Some simulated sex scenes are so realistic that critics mistakenly believe that they are real, such as the cunnilingus scene in the 2006 film ''[[Red Road (film)|Red Road]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/london_film_festival/article651832.ece|title=Sealed with a Glasgow kiss|last=Dalton|first=Stephen|date=7 October 2006|work=The Times|accessdate=10 January 2010|location=London}}</ref>

While the sex scenes may have been explicit and the actor maintains that they were real, nothing is shown onscreen that could not have been faked.

==Pornographic films reedited as mainstream releases==

Examples of this type of hybrid release include ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1976 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1976) shot as X-rated but first released as an R-rated version.
