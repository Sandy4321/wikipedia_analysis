The '''Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame''', located in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], [[United States]], honors exceptional [[basketball]] players, [[coach (sport)|coaches]], [[Official (basketball)|referees]], executives, and other major contributors to the game of basketball worldwide. The Basketball Hall of Fame was first incorporated in 1959 at [[Springfield College]]<U+2014>the institution where [[James Naismith]] invented the sport in 1891<U+2014>and in that year, the hall inducted its first class of members.

Located in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], the Basketball Hall of Fame is dedicated to preserving and promoting basketball at all levels and also serving as the ultimate library of the sport's history. To date, the Basketball Hall of Fame has honored [[List of members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|314 individuals and nine teams]].<!--Numbers as of September 7, 2012 induction ceremony-->

==History of the Springfield building==
The Naismith Hall of Fame was established in 1959 by [[Lee Williams (basketball)|Lee Williams]], a former athletic director at [[Colby College]]. In the 1960s, the Basketball Hall of Fame struggled to raise enough money for the construction of its first facility. However, during the following half a decade, the necessary amount was raised and the building opened on Feb. 17, 1968, less than one month after the [[National Basketball Association]] played its 18th All-Star Game. The Basketball Hall of Fame's Board named four inductees in its first year. In addition to honoring those who contributed to basketball, the Hall of Fame sought to make contributions of its own. In 1979, the Hall of Fame sponsored the Tip-Off Classic, a pre-season college basketball exhibition. This Tip-Off Classic has been the start to the college basketball season ever since - and although it does not always take place in Springfield, Massachusetts, generally it returns every few years.

In the 17 years that the original Basketball Hall of Fame operated at [[Springfield College]], it drew more than 630,000 visitors. The popularity of the Basketball Hall of Fame necessitated that a new facility be constructed - and in 1985, an $11 million facility was built beside the scenic [[Connecticut River]] in Springfield. As the new hall opened, it also recognized women for the first time, with inductees such as [[Senda Berenson Abbott]], who first introduced basketball to women at [[Smith College]]. During the years following its construction, the Basketball Hall of Fame's second facility drew far more visitors than ever anticipated, due in large part to the increasing popularity of the game but also to the scenic location beside the river and the second Hall's interesting modern architecture.

In 2002, the Basketball Hall of Fame moved again - this time merely 100 yards south along Springfield's riverfront - into a $47 million facility designed by renowned architects [[Gwathmey Siegel & Associates Architects|Gwathmey Siegel & Associates]]. The building's architecture features a metallic silver, basketball-shaped sphere flanked by two similarly symmetrical rhombuses. The dome is illuminated at night and features 80,000 square foot (7,400 m<U+00B2>,) including numerous restaurants and an extensive gift shop. The second Basketball Hall of Fame was not torn down but rather converted into an [[LA Fitness]] center and a Mexican restaurant (Mama Iguana's). The current Basketball Hall of Fame features Center Court, a full-sized basketball court on which visitors can play. Inside the building, there is a game gallery, many interactive exhibits, several theaters, and an honor ring of inductees. A large theater for ceremonies seats up to 300. The honorees inducted in 2002 included the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] and [[Magic Johnson]], a five-time NBA champion, three-time NBA finals MVP and Olympic gold medalist.<ref> http://www.livestrong.com/article/356457-the-history-of-the-basketball-hall-of-fame/#ixzz1Pbup9ruI</ref>

As of 2011, the current Basketball Hall of Fame has greatly exceeded attendance expectations, with basketball fans traveling to the Hall of Fame from all over the world. Despite the new facility's success, a logistical problem remains for the Basketball Hall of Fame and the City of Springfield. The two entities are separated by the [[Interstate 91]] elevated highway - one of the eastern United States' busiest highways - which, essentially, inhibits foot-traffic and other interaction between the Basketball Hall of Fame and Springfield's increasingly lively [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]]. Both the Hall and Springfield have made public statements about cooperating further so as to facilitate even more business and recreational growth for both; however the placement and height of Interstate 91 remain physical obstacles. Urban planners at universities such as [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|UMass Amherst]] have called for the I-91 to be moved, or to be re-configured so as to be pedestrian-friendly to Hall of Fame visitors. In 2010, the [[Urban Land Institute]] announced a plan to make the walk between Springfield's [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]] and the Hall of Fame (and riverfront) easier.<ref>http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/riverfront-proj.0.html</ref>

==Criteria for induction==
In contrast to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Pro Football]] and the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball]] Halls of Fame, Springfield honors international and American professionals, as well as American and international amateurs, making it arguably the most comprehensive Hall of Fame among major sports. As of 2011, the induction process employs a total of six committees to both screen and elect candidates. Four of these committees screen prospective candidates:<ref name="2011 class">{{cite press release|url=http://www.hoophall.com/news/2011/2/18/naismith-memorial-basketball-hall-of-fame-announces-12-final.html |title=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Announces 12 Finalists for 2011 Election |publisher=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame |date=February 18, 2011 |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}</ref>
* North American Screening Committee (9 members)
* Women's Screening Committee (7 members)
* International Screening Committee (7 members)
* Veterans Screening Committee (7 members), with "Veterans" defined as individuals whose careers ended at least 35 years before they are considered for election.<ref name=Enshrinement>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoophall.com/enshrinement-process/ |title=Guidelines For Nomination and Election Into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame |publisher=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}</ref>

Two committees formed in 2011 directly elect one candidate for each induction class:<ref name="2011 class"/>
* [[American Basketball Association]] Committee
* Early [[African American|African-American]] Pioneers of the Game Committee

Individuals who receive at least seven votes from the North American Screening Committee or five votes from one of the other screening committees in a given year are eligible to advance to an Honors Committee, composed of 12 members who vote on each candidate and rotating groups of 12 specialists (one group for female candidates, one group for international candidates, and one group for American and veterans candidates). However, each screening committee is limited as to the number of candidates it can put forth to the Honors Committee<U+2014>10 from the North American Committee, and two from each other committee. Any individual receiving at least 18 affirmative votes (75 percent of all votes cast) from the Honors Committee is approved for induction into the Hall of Fame. As long as the number of candidates receiving sufficient votes from a screening committee is not greater than the number of finalists that committee can put forth, advancement to the Honors Committee is generally pro forma, although the Hall's Board of Trustees may remove any candidate who "has damaged the integrity of the game of basketball" from consideration.<ref name=Enshrinement/>

To be considered for induction by a screening committee, a player must be fully retired from play for at least five years, while a coach or referee must be fully retired for at least five years or have been active full time in his/her respective craft on the professional, collegiate or high school level for at least 25 years. No years of service criterion is applied to those who have made a "significant contribution to the game of basketball". Sportswriters and commentators are elected as full-fledged members (in contrast to the Baseball Hall of Fame that places them in separate wings that are not considered in the "real" Hall of Fame).<ref name=Enshrinement/>

===Controversy===
Controversy has arisen over many aspects of the Hall's voting procedures, including voter anonymity. While sportswriter voters of other major sports' Halls of Fame openly debate their choices, the Naismith Hall does [http://www.nba.com/2010/news/features/steve_aschburner/08/12/hall.process/index.html not make the process transparent]. The Hall has also been [http://nba.fanhouse.com/2010/03/30/fans-to-vote-for-basketball-hall-of-fame-inductees/ criticized] in opinion columns for a tendency to enshrine active collegiate coaches and relatively obscure players while omitting some accomplished players and coaches.

==Other Hall awards==
In conjunction with the [[Final Four]] of each year's men's and women's [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Division I NCAA basketball tournaments]] the Naismith Hall gives out several awards to college basketball athletes: 

For men, the Hall presents the [[Bob Cousy Award]] to the top [[point guard]] from among players in [[Division I (NCAA)|Divisions I]], [[Division II (NCAA)|II]], and [[Division III (NCAA)|III]]. This award, given since 2004, is voted on by [[Bob Cousy|Cousy]] and a selection of basketball writers, college basketball coaches, sports information directors and fans.  

The Hall also presents the [[Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award]] to two college seniors<U+2014>one male player no taller than {{convert|72|in|m|sigfig=3}}, and one female player no taller than {{convert|68|in|m|sigfig=3}}<U+2014>determined to have been the nation's best student-athletes. The men's award, given since 1969, is voted on by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), and the women's, given since 1984, by members of the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]].
