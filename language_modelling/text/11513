The '''Izak catshark''' (or simply '''Izak''', ''Holohalaelurus regani'') is a [[species]] of [[catshark]], [[family (biology)|family]] [[Scyliorhinidae]], common off [[South Africa]] and southern [[Namibia]]. It typically inhabits the outer [[continental shelf]] at depths of {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with the males found deeper than females and juveniles. The Izak catshark has a short, wide, flattened head and a robust body tapering to a long, slender tail. It can be identified by its ornate color pattern of dark brown spots (in juveniles) or reticulations and blotches (in adults) on a light yellowish background, as well as by the enlarged [[dermal denticle]]s over its [[pectoral fin]]s and along its dorsal midline from the snout to the second [[dorsal fin]]. This species reaches {{convert|69|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, with the males larger than females.

[[Benthic fish|Bottom-dwelling]] and perhaps relatively active in nature, the Izak catshark feeds mainly on a diverse of [[bony fish]]es, [[crustacean]]s, and [[cephalopod]]s. A significant portion of its diet may be [[scavenger|scavenged]] from [[offal]] discarded by [[fisheries]]. This species is [[oviparous]], with females producing [[egg case (Chondrichthyes)|encapsulated eggs]] two at a time year-round. The Izak catshark is regularly [[bycatch|caught incidentally]] by a South African [[bottom trawl]] [[commercial fishing|commercial fishery]], but is discarded rather than utilized. Despite the fishing pressure, its population has been increasing and thus the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has assessed it as [[Least Concern]].

==Taxonomy==
The Izak catshark was originally described by [[South Africa]]n [[ichthyologist]] John Gilchrist in a 1922 [[fishery|fisheries]] survey report. He assigned the new species to the genus ''[[Scyliorhinus|Scylliorhinus]]'', and gave it the [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''regani'' in honor of fellow ichthyologist [[Charles Tate Regan]].<ref name="gilchrist"/> In 1934, [[Henry Weed Fowler]] assigned this species to his newly created ''[[Holohalaelurus]]'', a subgenus of ''[[Halaelurus]]''. ''Holohalaelurus'' has since been elevated to the rank of full genus.<ref name="compagno"/> As there do not appear to be any existing [[type specimen]]s referable to Gilchrist's account, in 2006 Brett Human designated a {{convert|63|cm|in|abbr=on}} long male caught in [[Hondeklip Bay]] as the species [[neotype]].<ref name="human"/>

Historically, there has been much confusion in the scientific literature between ''H. regani'', ''[[white-spotted Izak|H. punctatus]]'', and [[crying Izak|''H. melanostigma'']], the last of which at various times had been considered a [[junior synonym]] of ''H. regani'' and was itself confounded with [[crying Izak|''H. grennian'']]. Furthermore, two forms of ''H. regani'' were once recognized: the "Cape" or "typical" form and the "Natal" or "northeastern" form. The latter "northeastern" form was described as a separate species, [[honeycomb Izak|''H. favus'']], in 2006.<ref name="human"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Endemism|Endemic]] to the southern tip of Africa, the range of the Izak catshark extends from [[L<U+00FC>deritz]], [[Namibia]] in the west to [[Durban]], South Africa in the east. Older records further north along the [[East Africa]]n coast (e.g. [[Somalia]]) most likely refer to other ''Holohalaelurus'' species.<ref name="human"/> This abundant, [[benthic fish|bottom-dwelling]] species inhabits the outer [[continental shelf]] and upper [[continental slope]], from {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} to at least {{convert|1075|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="human"/> Off South Africa, it is most common in areas with a wider continental shelf, and at depths of {{convert|100|-|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} off the south coast and {{convert|200|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} off the west coast. Females and juveniles tend to be found in shallower water than males. For the most part, the number of sharks in a given area remains largely constant throughout the year.<ref name="richardson et al"/> However, sharks at the southernmost point of the [[Agulhas Bank]] may perform a small autumn [[fish migration|migration]] towards the shore.<ref name="iucn"/>

==Description==
[[Image:Holohalaelurus regani side.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|left|The Izak catshark has a very long caudal peduncle and distinctively ornate dorsal markings.]]
The body of the Izak catshark is firm and stout, tapering dramatically towards the tail. The head is very short, wide, and flattened, with a blunt snout. The horizontally oval eyes are placed high on the head and have thick ridges beneath; each has a rudimentary [[nictitating membrane]] and is followed by a [[spiracle]]. The nostrils are preceded by triangular flaps of skin that almost reach the long, angular mouth. The mouth contains prominent [[papilla (fish anatomy)|papillae]] on both the roof and the floor, and lacks furrows at the corners. The upper and lower jaws contain on average 65 and 60 tooth rows respectively; each tooth is relatively large, with a narrow central [[Cusp (dentistry)|cusp]] flanked by 1<U+2013>2 smaller cusplets. There are five pairs of [[gill slit]]s.<ref name="human"/><ref name="compagno"/>

The [[pectoral fin]]s are rather long and broad. The first [[dorsal fin]] originates over the rear of the [[pelvic fin]] bases; the second dorsal fin is slightly larger and originates over the rear of the [[anal fin]] base. The pelvic and anal fins are long and low, and larger than the dorsal fins. The free rear tips of the pelvic fins may be fused together to some degree, but never completely; males have slender, pointed [[claspers]]. The [[caudal peduncle]] is long and thin, particularly in younger sharks. The [[caudal fin]] makes up one-fourth to one-fifth of the total length and has a weak lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The thick skin is covered by well-[[calcification|calcified]] [[dermal denticle]]s, except around the gill slits. Enlarged, spike-like denticles are found on the upper surface of the pectoral fins and along the dorsal midline from the snout to the second dorsal fin origin.<ref name="human"/><ref name="compagno"/> Juvenile Izak catsharks are boldly patterned with many irregularly shaped dark brown spots on a light yellow to yellowish brown background. The spots enlarge and fuse with age to form an intricate pattern of reticulations and U-shaped markings in adults. The underside is plain white, with obvious black sensory pores beneath the head, body, and paired fins.<ref name="human"/> Like other ''Holohalaelurus'' species, but contrary to the pattern in most [[cartilaginous fish]]es, males attain a much greater maximum length than females: {{convert|69|cm|in|abbr=on}} versus {{convert|52|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="richardson et al"/>

==Biology and ecology==
[[Image:Lesser Flying Squid - Todaropsis eblanae.jpg|thumb|Squid such as ''[[Todaropsis eblanae]]'' are preyed upon by the Izak catshark.]]
Compared to other deep-sea sharks, the Izak catshark has a large [[heart]] suggestive of a relatively active lifestyle. It is a [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]] that feeds on a wide variety of [[bony fish]]es, [[crustacean]]s, and [[cephalopod]]s; larger sharks consume proportionately more crustaceans and fewer fishes. At least some part of its recorded diet probably represents [[scavenger|scavenging]] from [[fishery]] discards, given the presence of fast-moving, [[pelagic]] species that the shark is unlikely to have captured live. [[Polychaete worm]]s, [[hydrozoa]]ns, [[gastropod]]s, and [[hagfish]] eggs may also be occasionally ingested.<ref name="richardson et al"/><ref name="fishbase"/> This species often has [[nematode]] and [[flatworm]] [[parasite]]s in its [[stomach]].<ref name="richardson et al"/>

The Izak catshark is [[oviparous]] and reproduction proceeds throughout the year without seasonal patterns. Mature females have a single functional [[ovary]] and two functional [[oviduct]]s; a single egg matures within each oviduct at a time. Each egg is contained within a purse-shaped [[egg case (Chondrichthyes)|capsule]] {{convert|3.6|-|4.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1.2|-|1.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} across. The capsule is light brown with long tendrils at the four corners that likely serve to anchor it to rocks; its surface has a [[velvet]]-like texture and bears lengthwise striations. The rate of egg laying is unknown but thought to be high, based on this shark's resilience to fishing pressure. The preponderance of females and juveniles at shallower depths may indicate that such waters serve as nursery areas. The young hatch at under {{convert|11|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. Males and females [[sexual maturity|mature sexually]] at {{convert|45|-|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|40|-|45|cm|in|abbr=on}} long respectively.<ref name="richardson et al"/>

==Human interactions==
The Izak catshark is harmless and of no commercial value.<ref name="compagno"/><ref name="fishbase"/> It is regularly [[bycatch|caught incidentally]] (and discarded) by a [[bottom trawl]] [[fishery]] targeting [[Merluccidae|hake]] south of [[Cape Town]]. In contrast to most cartilaginous fishes, its numbers have been increasing in the presence of [[commercial fishing]].<ref name="iucn"/> The reasons for this may include its high reproductive rate, its breeding in less-fished shallower waters, its hardiness allowing for high post-capture survival, and its opportunistic diet.<ref name="richardson et al"/> The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has consequently listed the Izak catshark under [[Least Concern]], while still noting that it merits continued population monitoring because of its highly restricted range.<ref name="iucn"/>
