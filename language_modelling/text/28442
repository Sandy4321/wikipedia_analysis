Chorz<U+00F3>w used to be one of the most important cities in the largest Polish economic area (the [[Upper Silesian Industrial Region|Upper Silesian Industry Area]]) with extensive industry in [[coal mining]], steel, chemistry, manufacturing, and energy sectors. Many heavy-industry establishments were closed or scaled down in the last two decades because of [[List of environmental issues|environmental issues]] in the center of a highly urbanized area, and also because of decades-long lack of investment. Others were restructured and modernized. Wedged between a dozen of other cities, the population has been decreasing. The city character has been evolving towards the [[service economy]] as new industrial development takes mostly place at the border of the [[Upper Silesian Metropolitan Union]]. The [[Unemployment|unemployment rate]] is high (12.6% on 2007-12-31) but decreasing;<ref>Official regional statistics, [http://www.wup-katowice.pl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=119&Itemid=37&WUPSID=a253649ede1bf9901bced0cc69e9df6a Wup.katowice.pl], Retrieved 2008-03-18.</ref> the workforce is generally highly technically skilled.

==History==

===City name===
[[File:Chorzow Saint Barbara.jpg|thumb|250px|Saint Barbara Church, the oldest church in Chorz<U+00F3>w (from year 1859)]]
[[File:Chorzow Saint Lawrence.jpg|thumb|250px|16th-century St. Lawrence wooden church, moved to Chorz<U+00F3>w from [[Knur<U+00F3>w]] in 1935]]

The city of Chorz<U+00F3>w was formed in 1934-1939 by a merger of 4 adjacent cities: Chorz<U+00F3>w, Kr<U+00F3>lewska Huta, Nowe Hajduki and Hajduki Wielkie. The name of the oldest settlement ''Chorz<U+00F3>w'' was applied to the amalgamated city.

In 2007, Chorz<U+00F3>w became a part of [[Upper Silesian Metropolitan Union]], effectively forming the largest legally recognized urban entity in Poland. The Latin word [[Silesia]] seems to be the favourite candidate for the name of the new metropolis.

'''Chorz<U+00F3>w''' (German Chorzow): The etymology of the name is not known. Chorz<U+00F3>w is believed to be first mentioned as Zversov or Zuersov (u and v were written similar in [[Middle Ages]]) in a document of 1136 by [[Pope Innocent II]] as village with peasants, silver miners and two inns. Another place name likely indicating Chorz<U+00F3>w is Coccham or Coccha, which is mentioned in a document of 1198 by the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]], who awarded this place to the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre|Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem]]. Next, Chorz<U+00F3>w is mentioned as Chareu (Charev) in 1257 and then ''Charzow'' in 1292. The last name may originate from the [[personal name]] ''Charz'', short for ''Zachary'' and may mean ''Zachary's place''. The ''a'' in the early names may have been later modified to the current pronunciation with ''o'' perhaps due to similarity to the [[Proper adjective|common adjective]] ''chory''=''ill'' and a presence of a hospital (which was moved in 1299 to [[Bytom]]). Today, the place of the old village is a subdivision called ''Chorz<U+00F3>w III'' or ''Chorz<U+00F3>w Stary'' = ''the Old Chorz<U+00F3>w''.

'''Kr<U+00F3>lewska Huta''' (German K<U+00F6>nigsh<U+00FC>tte): The industrial and residential settlement south-west of Chorz<U+00F3>w constructed since 1797 around the ''Royal Coal Mine'' and ''Royal Iron Works'' was named ''Kr<U+00F3>lewska Huta'' by the Poles or ''K<U+00F6>nigsh<U+00FC>tte'' by the Germans, both names meaning ''Royal Iron Works''. As it was growing quickly this settlement was granted [[Town privileges|city status]] in 1868. Today this neighbourhood is called ''Chorz<U+00F3>w I'' or ''Chorz<U+00F3>w-Miasto'' meaning ''Chorz<U+00F3>w Centre''.

'''Hajduki''' (German Heiduk): the name etymology is ambiguous and is interpreted<ref>Jacek Kurek "Historia Wielkich Hajduk", Zwi<U+0105>zek G<U+00F3>rno<U+015B>l<U+0105>ski Ko<U+0142>o, Wielkie Hajduki, Chorz<U+00F3>w, 2001</ref> as either (1) related to the German word for [[moorland]] (German: die Heide), or (2) adopted from the German/Polish/Silesian term for [[hajduk]](s) (Polish (plural): Hajduki; German (singular): Heiduck), which locally meant bandits. The place was first mentioned in 1627 as ''Hejduk'' and shown on 18th century maps as "Ober Heiduk" and "Nieder Heiduk" (i.e., Upper and Lower Heiduk). The later names ''Hajduki Wielkie'' and ''Nowe Hajduki'' mean ''Great Hajduks'' and ''New Hajduks'', respectively. The two settlements were merged in 1903 and named after the [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] [[Ironworks|Iron Works]] ''Bismarckh<U+00FC>tte''. When the international borders shifted, the name of Bismarck was replaced with the name of the [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish king]] [[B<U+00E1>thory|Batory]] (so-chosen to preserve that initial "B", which appeared on an economically important local trademark). Today this city subdivision is called ''Chorz<U+00F3>w IV'' or ''Chorz<U+00F3>w-Batory''.

===From 12th century to World War I===

====Village of Chorz<U+00F3>w====
In the 12th century, the [[castellany]] of [[Bytom]], including the Chorz<U+00F3>w area, belonged to the province of [[Krak<U+00F3>w]]. In 1179 it was awarded by Duke [[Casimir II the Just|Casimir the Just]] to the Duke of [[Opole]], and since that time the history of Chorz<U+00F3>w has been connected to the history of [[Upper Silesia]] ([[Duchy of Opole]]).

The oldest part of the city, the village of Chorz<U+00F3>w, today called ''Chorz<U+00F3>w Stary'', belonged since 1257 to the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre|Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem]]. Already at that time silver and lead ores were mined nearby, later also the ores of iron. There is more documentation for 16th century developments.

From 1327, the Upper Silesian duchies were ruled by the dukes of the [[Piast dynasty]] and were subject to [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]] overlordship.  The [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] elected Polish-Lituanian [[Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellon]]s kings from 1490 and Austrian [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]]s kings after 1526. In 1742, the area was conquered by the Prussian [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]]s in [[Silesian Wars]], setting the stage for the Prussian industrial might. The Prussian and then German period lasted for about 180 years and overlapped with the time of rapid industrialization.

====Royal iron works, coal mines and chemistry====
[[File:Adolph Menzel - Eisenwalzwerk - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Steelworks at K<U+00F6>nigsh<U+00FC>tte, 1872-1875 ("Das Eisenwalzwerk" by [[Adolph Menzel|Adolf von Menzel]])]]
With the discovery of [[bituminous coal]] deposits at the end of the 18th century by a [[local church]] priest, new industrial sectors developed in the Chorz<U+00F3>w area. In the years 1791&ndash;1797 the Prussian [[Public ownership|state-owned]] Royal Coal Mine was constructed (''Kopalnia Kr<U+00F3>l'', ''K<U+00F6>nigsgrube'', later renamed several times with the changing political winds). In 1799,  first [[pig iron]] was made in the Royal Iron Works (''Kr<U+00F3>lewska Huta'', ''K<U+00F6>nigsh<U+00FC>tte''). At the time, it was a pioneering industrial establishment of its kind in [[continental Europe]]. In 1819 the iron works consisted of 4 [[blast furnace]]s, producing 1,400 tons of pig-iron. In the 1800s the modern Lidognia Zinc Works was added in the area. In 1871 the iron works were taken over by the holding called ''Vereingte K<U+00F6>nigs- und Laurah<U+00FC>tte [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]] f<U+00FC>r Bergbau und H<U+00FC>ttenbetrieb'', which added a [[steel mill]], rail mill and workshops. In the vicinity of the Royal Coal Mine, ''Countess Laura'' Coal Mine was opened in 1870, and by 1913&ndash;1914 coal production increased to 1 million tons a year. In 1898, a [[Thermal power station|thermal power plant]] was commissioned which was, until the 1930s, the biggest electricity producer in Poland with power of 100 MW (electrical). Today, it operates as [[Chorz<U+00F3>w Power Station|"ELCHO"]]. In 1915, nitrogen chemical works (Oberschlesische Stickstoffwerke) were built nearby to produce fertilizers and explosives by newly invented processes: from air, water and coal (see [[Haber process|Haber-Bosch process]]). Today, it operates as "Zak<U+0142>ady Azotowe SA".

====Kr<U+00F3>lewska Huta: from village to city====
Settlements grew near the new coal and iron works. Since 1797, one group of settlements was called ''K<U+00F6>nigsh<U+00FC>tte'' (''Kr<U+00F3>lewska Huta'' in Polish) after the iron works. In 1846 Kr<U+00F3>lewska Huta received a [[Rail tracks|railway track]] to [[<U+015A>wi<U+0119>toch<U+0142>owice]] and [[Mys<U+0142>owice]], in 1857 to [[Bytom]] and till 1872 to all major cities in the Silesian region. Kr<U+00F3>lewska Huta received city status in 1868 as part of [[Bytom]] County, and in 1898 it was made a separate [[Consolidated city-county|city-county]].

The population of Kr<U+00F3>lewska Huta was increasing rapidly: from 19,500 inhabitants in 1870 to 72,600 in 1910. Among them 17,300 workers were employed in the industry (similar number for 1939). The population spoke mostly Silesian or German.

====Hajduki Wielkie suburb====
In the village of Hajduki Wielkie, just south of Chorz<U+00F3>w and Kr<U+00F3>lewska Huta, Bismarck Iron Works (''Bismarckh<U+00FC>tte''), were opened in 1872, later called Bathory Iron Works (''Huta Batory''). A large [[carbochemistry|carbochemical]] plant was started in 1889, the first such [[chemical plant]] in what was to later become the Polish state. Today the company operates as "Zak<U+0142>ady Koksochemiczne Hajduki SA".

====Polish minority====
Towards the end of 19th century, Chorz<U+00F3>w experienced a revival of Polish national feelings. Ethnic tensions were mixed with the religious and [[Class struggle|class conflict]]s. [[Karol Miarka]] was the editor of Polish books and newspapers including ''Katolik'' (The Catholic) published in Kr<U+00F3>lewska Huta since 1868, ''Poradnik Gospodarski'' since 1879. He was also the founder of several organizations: Upper Silesian Union, Upper Silesian Peasants Union. [[Juliusz Ligon|Juliusz Ligo<U+0144>]] was a Polish activist and poet.

===In Poland (1922<U+2013>1939)===
In the [[Upper Silesia plebiscite]] a majority of 31,864 voters voted to remain in Germany while 10,764 votes were given for Poland<ref>[http://www.herder-institut.de/startseite/dokumente-und-materialien/moduluebersicht/zweite-polnische-republik/materialien.html?tx_himmat_pi1&#x5B;showUid&#x5D;=169&cHash=64c5894541f8d9b304ebee841028f938 Herder Institut] {{de icon}}</ref> Following three [[Silesian Uprisings|Silesian uprisings]], the eastern part of Silesia, including Chorz<U+00F3>w and Kr<U+00F3>lewska Huta, was separated from Germany and awarded to [[Poland]] in 1922. Migrations of people followed. Because of its strategic value, the case of the nitrogen factory [[Oberschlesische Stickstoffwerke]] was argued for years before the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]], finally setting some new legal precedences on what is "just" in international relations.<ref>"The Seventh Year of the Permanent Court of International Justice", Manley O. Hudson, The American Journal of [[International law|International Law]], Vol. 23, No. 1 (Jan., 1929), pp. 1-29, {{doi|10.2307/2190232}}, [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9300(192901)23%3A1%3C1%3ATSYOTP%3E2.0.CO%3B2-6 Jstor.org]</ref> In 1934 the industrial communities of Chorz<U+00F3>w, Kr<U+00F3>lewska Huta and Nowe Hajduki were merged into one municipality with 81,000 inhabitants. The name of the oldest settlement ''Chorz<U+00F3>w'' was given to the whole city. In April 1939 the settlement of Hajduki Wielkie with 30,000 inhabitants was added to Chorz<U+00F3>w.

In part due to the German-Polish [[trade war]] in the 1920s, the industry of Chorz<U+00F3>w, a border city at that time, stagnated until 1933. In 1927, a division of [[Huta Pi<U+0142>sudski]] was separated into a company making rail cars, trams and bridges; today it operates as [[Alstom|Alstom-Konstal]]. The State Factory of [[Nitrogen|Nitrogen Compounds]] (Pa<U+0144>stwowa Fabryka Zwi<U+0105>zk<U+00F3>w Azotowych) was in 1933 merged with a similar company (largely its copy) in [[Tarn<U+00F3>w|Tarn<U+00F3>w-Mo<U+015B>cice]].

===German period during World War II (1939<U+2013>1945)===
On the day of the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, Chorz<U+00F3>w was taken by [[Nazi Germany]]. Polish irregulars, mainly Silesian uprising veterans and [[Polish Scouting Association|Scouts]], put up resistance to the regular German forces for three days, most of them were  murdered in mass executions. Polish property was confiscated, and Chorz<U+00F3>w (with the balance of Polish Silesia) was promptly re-incorporated into German Silesia (''Preu<U+00DF>ische Provinz Schlesien'', from 1941 ''Oberschlesien''); the Upper Silesian industry being one the pillars of the Nazi Germany [[war effort]]. There were several enforced [[labor camp]]s in Chorz<U+00F3>w and, in years 1944&ndash;1945, two [[List of subcamps of Auschwitz|branches]] of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Chorz<U+00F3>w was occupied by Soviet [[Red Army]] in January 1945 with the subsequent persecution of many ethnic Silesians and Germans.<ref>"The Dynamics of the Policies of [[Ethnic cleansing|Ethnic Cleansing]] in Silesia in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries" by Tomasz Kamusella, Chapter 8, [[Open Society Institute]], Center for Publishing Development, Budapest, Hungary, 1999, [http://rss.archives.ceu.hu/archive/00001016/01/17.pdf RSS.archives.ceu.hu]</ref>

===After 1945===
At the end of World War II, Chorz<U+00F3>w (with the balance of Silesia) was re-incorporated into Poland. Generally, the Chorz<U+00F3>w industry suffered little damage during World War II due to its inaccessibility to [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing]], a Soviet Army [[Pincer movement|enveloping maneuver]] in January 1945,<ref>Max Hastings, "Armageddon. The Battle for Germany 1944-1945", [[Alfred A. Knopf]], New York, 2004, page 248</ref> and perhaps [[Albert Speer]]'s slowness or refusal to implement the [[scorched earth]] policy. This intact industry now played a critical role in the post-war reconstruction and industralization of Poland. After the war, businesses were nationalized and operated, with minor changes, till 1989. At the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] in 1989, the area was in decline. Since 1989, the region has been transitioning from [[heavy industry]] to a more diverse economy. In 2007, Chorz<U+00F3>w became a part of [[Upper Silesian Metropolitan Union]], a voluntary union of a continuous chain of cities aimed at increasing the poor visibility of the area, improving its competitiveness, and modernizing the infrastructure.

In this period, the region experienced several waves of migrations, including those commencing in 1945 (to Germany and from Poland), in 1971 (to Germany), in 1982 (to [[Western world|Western countries]]), and in 2005 (to other countries of the [[European Union|EU]]).
