It opened in early [[2007]]. It is the fifth tallest building in Japan behind [[Yokohama Landmark Tower]], [[Rinku Gate Tower Building]], [[Osaka WTC Building|Osaka World Trade Center Building]] and [[Tokyo Midtown|Midtown Tower]]. Midland Square houses offices of many companies including [[Toyota Motor Corporation]], Towa Real Estate and [[Mainichi Shimbun]]. 

At 247m (810 feet), it is slightly taller than the nearby [[JR Central Towers]]. Midland Square features a shopping center with 60 name-brand stores, two automobile showrooms and a cinema. It also holds the record for the highest open-air observation deck in Japan. Also of note are the unusual double-floored elevators, which take only 40 seconds to rise to the top.
