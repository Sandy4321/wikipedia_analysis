'''Betzdorf Castle''' ({{lang-lb|Betzder Schlass}}, {{lang-fr|Ch<U+00E2>teau de Betzdorf}}, {{lang-de|Betzdorf Schloss/Schloss Betzdorf}}) is a former castle in the [[Communes of Luxembourg|commune]] of [[Betzdorf, Luxembourg|Betzdorf]], in eastern [[Luxembourg]].  It is the headquarters of [[SES S.A.]], the world's largest satellite operator in terms of revenue and the largest component of [[Luxembourg Stock Exchange]]'s main [[LuxX Index]].  It is located north-west of Betzdorf village, to the north of the [[CFL Line 30]] railway line.  Since its acquisition by SES, the company has built a large commercial and industrial centre around the castle.

It should not be confused with Berg Castle, located in nearby [[Berg, Luxembourg|Berg]], which serves as the communal headquarters for Betzdorf.

==History==
The castle was the home of [[Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Hereditary Grand Duke Jean]] from his marriage to [[Jos<U+00E9>phine-Charlotte of Belgium]], on 9 April 1953, until 16 November 1964,<ref name="Parverband Widdebierg">{{de icon}} {{cite web |url=http://parverband.betzdorf.lu/chronik_betzdorf.html |title=Lokalchronik von Dorf und Pfarrei Betzdorf |accessdate=2008-05-15 |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Parverband Widdebierg }}</ref> when he succeeded to the [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duchy]] upon [[Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Grand Duchess Charlotte]]'s resignation.  All of Jean and Jos<U+00E9>phine-Charlotte's children were born at Betzdorf Castle: 
* [[Archduchess Marie Astrid of Austria|Princess Marie-Astrid]] (born 17 February 1954)
* [[Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke Henri]] (born 16 April 1955)
* [[Prince Jean of Luxembourg|Prince Jean]] and [[Princess Margaretha of Liechtenstein|Princess Margaretha]]  (twins born 15 May 1957)
* [[Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg|Prince Guillaume]] (born 1 May 1963)

After the vacation by new Grand Duke's family, the castle became a nursing home, which it remained until [[1982]].  In July of that year, the castle served as a base camp for 3,000 [[Scouting|Scout]]s celebrating the 75th anniversary of the movement's foundation.<ref name="Parverband Widdebierg" />  Afterwards, it was left empty until SES bought the castle in [[1986]] and began extensive development work to make it their headquarters.<ref name="Parverband Widdebierg" />
