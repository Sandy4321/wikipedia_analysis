The '''Kalungas''' are descendants of run-away slaves who lived in remote settlements in northeastern [[Goi<U+00E1>s]] state, [[Brazil]].  Most of the 4,000 Kalungas, who are of mixed race, black and native Indian, live in very poor conditions in near the town of [[Cavalcante]], Goi<U+00E1>s.

All of the area occupied by the Kalungas was officially recognized by the state government in 1991 as a Historical Site and the Kalunga are preserved as Patrim<U+00F4>nio Cultural Kalunga.  The Kalungas settled in the mountains on both sides of the [[Paran<U+00E1> River]], on slopes and in valleys, called V<U+00E3>os.  Today they occupy the territory of Cavalcante, [[Monte Alegre]] e [[Teresina de Goi<U+00E1>s]].   The four main settlements are in the region of Contenda, the V<U+00E3>o do Calunga, the V<U+00E3>o de Almas, the V<U+00E3>o do Moleque and the Ribeir<U+00E3>o dos Bois. 

==History== 
There is confusion about the meaning of the word Kalunga or Calunga, which, despite the same sound, have totally different meanings: Kalunga <U+2013> connected to religious beliefs, world of the ancestors, cult of the forefathers, from them came the force; Calunga - small or insignificant thing; a way to call Negros, considered inferior; a famous or important person.
 
In the land of the Kalunga people, calunga is the name of a plant - ''Simaba ferruginea'' <U+2013> and the place where it grows, near a stream of the same name.  It makes the land where it grows sacred, a land that never dries, good for planting food for all of life.  

They chose the [[Chapada]] region because of its inaccessibility, since their former "owners" would not risk searching for them in that place.    It is a sea of mountains and hills full of [[buriti]] palms extending to the horizon.  They are steep slopes, full of stones.  The narrow trails wind and climb, almost lost in the dense vegetation and stone walls fall abruptly into the low valleys.  

These descendants of slaves lived isolated from the towns of Goi<U+00E1>s. They learned to live with what the [[cerrado]]  gave them, in food as well in building materials and tools.  Even living isolated from each other they considered themselves relatives.  Periodically, they would make their way out of the wasteland to venture down to the towns to buy kitchen utensils or certain foods.  Their means of transport was primitive boats or troops of donkeys.
