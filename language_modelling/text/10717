'''Kingsland Station''' is a [[New Jersey Transit]] rail station on the carrier's [[Main Line (NJ Transit)|Main Line]]. It is located under Ridge Road ([[New Jersey Route 17]]) between New York and Valley Brook Avenue in [[Lyndhurst, New Jersey]], and is one of two stations in Lyndhurst.  The station is not staffed, and passengers use Ticket Vending Machines (TVM) which are located at street level to purchase tickets.  The station is not handicapped-accessible. Originally part of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]]'s [[Boonton Branch]], Kingsland station was built in 1903. The design of the station depot located above the tracks was later replicated by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western's [[Montclair Branch]] for its [[Watsessing Avenue (NJT station)|Watsessing Avenue station]] in [[Bloomfield, New Jersey]].<ref name="yanosey">{{cite book|last=Yanosey|first=Robert J.|title=Lackawanna Railroad Facilities (In Color)|publisher=Morning Sun Books Inc.|location=[[Scotch Plains, New Jersey]]|date=2007|volume=Volume 1: Hoboken to Dover|isbn=1582482144|pages=104}}</ref>

== Station layout and services ==
Kingsland station is located on a bridge over the Main Line on [[New Jersey Route 17]], near the intersection with Milton Road. The station depot is located above the tracks, which has a short tunnel leading down stairs to the two side platforms. The station platform on the [[Hoboken Terminal]]-bound side has a third track that heads through the platform, the western leg of a wye used for the Harrison Cut-Off, built by the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]]. Above ground, the station is provided with just nineteen spaces of parking, none of which are built for handicapped persons, and cost nothing to use on a daily basis. Parking is also provided by New Jersey Transit on Route&nbsp;17 under short term limits.<ref name="parkinginfo">{{cite web|url=http://www.njtransit.com/rg/rg_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=TrainStationLookupFrom&selStation=66|title= Station and Parking Info: Kingsland|date=2010|publisher=New Jersey Transit|location=[[Newark, New Jersey]]|accessdate=July 9, 2010}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad ===

[[File:Harrison Cut-Off Track at Kingsland.jpg|right|thumb|The Harrison Cut-Off track just south of the Kingsland station platform. The track continues through the platform]]
The [[Boonton Branch]] of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] was first constructed as a freight bypass of the [[Morris & Essex Railroad]] in 1868. This was constructed due to the lack of freight along its passenger lines and stretched from [[Denville (NJT station)|the Denville station]] to [[Hoboken Terminal]] via [[Boonton, New Jersey|Boonton]] and [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]]. The line had shops at Kingsland, built in 1868 for the purpose of repairing, restoring and re-erecting train cars and locomotives for the line. In 1875, shop equipment from Hoboken was moved over to Kingsland. However, just seven years later, the machine shop, also the main building of the shops, caught fire and was completely destroyed. However, despite the fire, the structure was immediately reconstructed for use. During this time, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western used a small house as a station depot.<ref name="historyof">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9KwPofkJTHYC&pg=PA421&dq=Kingsland+Station+NJ&hl=en&ei=K-w0TP_5JMH6lweKuODTBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Kingsland%20Station%20NJ&f=false|title=History of Bergen County, New Jersey|first=James M.|last=Van Valen|year=1900|publisher=New Jersey Publishing and Engraving Company|location=[[New York, New York]]|accessdate=July 7, 2010|page=421}}</ref> 

When the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western expanded the Kingsland Shops in 1903,<ref name="expand">{{cite journal|date=May 1905|title=Railway and locomotive engineering: a practical journal of railway motive power and rolling stock|publisher=A. Sinclair Co.,|volume=18|page=442|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EQdLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA442&dq=Kingsland+Station+NJ&hl=en&ei=9Ow0TNe-CMOAlAfJ6_XVBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDge#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=July 7, 2010}}</ref> a new station depot was constructed of brick along with a cut and cover tunnel. The tunnel itself cost $71,500 (1903 USD) and permitted the local street, Schuyler Avenue to cross over the rail line. The new station depot was built on Ridge Road over the tracks, with platforms crossing over the new bridge. The station design was later replicated on the Montclair Branch for [[Bloomfield, New Jersey|Bloomfield
s]] [[Watsessing Avenue (NJT station)|Watsessing Avenue station]] in 1912.<ref name="yanosey" />

In 1917, the railroad was brought in front of the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, due to an accident on November 28, 1916 at Kingsland station. As passenger train No. 582, a special train for employees of the Canadian Car Company, was near stopped at Kingsland station. The train never left at any defined time, although averaged around 6:30 in the evening. However, around 6:30 that evening, Train No. 479 came in twelve minutes late at a high rate of speed, and as a result could not slow down fast enough to avoid hitting passengers. At that time, the station had no inter-track fencing to prevent crossing of both Boonton Branch tracks, and because of this, people could board trains from either platform. That, day the engineer of Train No. 479 was unable to see the platform or the special train, and due to the lack of signals, was devoid of knowing anything until leaving the west portal of Kingsland Tunnel. However, signals were set for west-bound trains if said problems were to occur. After the accident, the Lackawanna was requested by the board to install a westbound signal to prevent further accidents, while the Canadian Car Company moved their boarding to the company's rail siding.<ref name="accident">{{cite book|title=Reports of the Board of Public Utility Commissioners of the State of New Jersey,|publisher=New Jersey.

=== Erie-Lackawanna Railroad and the Passaic Plan ===
After several years of sharing railroad facilities, the [[Erie Railroad]] and Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad merged on October 17, 1960, replaced by the [[Erie-Lackawanna Railway]]. Since 1949 the Erie Railroad had been dealing with the city of [[Passaic, New Jersey]] about its double track mainline through the city via [[Rutherford, New Jersey|Rutherford]].<ref name="trackrem1949">{{cite news|title=Track Removal Sought|date=July 14, 1961|work=The New York Times|publisher=Time Warner|page=6|accessdate=7 July 2010|location=New York, New York}}</ref> Due to the high cost of removing the main line with no back-up service, it was unable to progress forward, and as a result, the Erie built some new stations to replace old wooden ones in 1952.<ref name="yanosey2" /> With the railroad merge in 1960, the Erie-Lackawanna had the Boonton Branch that also served Passaic, and on August 23, 1960, with pressure from the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] to go ahead with it, a deal was struck between the city of Passaic and the railroad.<ref name="dealstrike">{{cite news|title=Erie Agrees to Let Passaic Eliminate Downtown Tracks|date=August 24, 1960|work=The New York Times|publisher=Time Warner|page=31|accessdate=7 July 2010|location=New York, New York}}</ref> A new connection was to be made via the Erie's old Newark Branch to connect the Boonton Branch to the old Erie main at South Paterson. The old Erie main line through Passaic was abandoned at a ceremony on April 2, 1963, when service was terminated and service. Trains were re-routed via a "new" main line, using the Boonton Branch from Kingsland to Athenia.<ref name="yanosey" />

The remainder of the Boonton Branch was steadily decommissioned through 1963, as the New Jersey Department of Transportation requested the Boonton Branch's alignment through Paterson as part of [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|Interstate 80]] and [[New Jersey Route 21]] through Passaic near BE Drawbridge and the [[Passaic Park (Erie Railroad station)|Passaic Park station]]. This was turned over to the Department of Transportation on October 27, 1963 after a connection was constructed at [[Mountain View (NJT station)|Mountain View]] to the Erie's former New York and Greenwood Lake Railroad. The stretch from Paterson Junction to Totowa, including the Paterson High Bridge built in 1902, was abandoned and soon dismantled.<ref name="yanosey" /> However, despite the changes, the Erie-Lackawanna continued to lose strength and in 1975, agreed to become of the [[Consolidated Rail Corporation]], dubbed Conrail, which took effect on April 1, 1976.<ref name="yanosey2">{{cite book|last=Yanosey|first=Robert J.|title=Erie Railroad Facilities (In Color)|publisher=Morning Sun Books Inc.|location=[[Scotch Plains, New Jersey]]|date=2006|volume=Volume 1: New Jersey|isbn=1582481830}}</ref> 

=== New Jersey Transit ===

On September 20, 2002, as part of the [[Montclair Connection]], merging the [[Montclair Branch]] and [[Boonton Line]], the [[Arlington (NJT station)|Arlington station]] in [[Kearny, New Jersey|Kearny]] was closed, resulting in the lack of a station in Kearny. As a result, a rail shuttle bus was formed by the town of Kearny to bus passengers from Arlington station up to Kingsland via Route 76 bus route, giving rail passenger service to [[New York Penn Station]] and Hoboken Terminal. Shuttle buses were aligned at that time with the 5:02 AM, 6:03 PM and 7:08 PM. Services were adjusted for the timetable services on September 30, 2002.<ref name="arlingtonclosure">{{cite press release|title=Rail Shuttle Buses To Transport Commuters Affected By Station Closures|publisher=New Jersey Transit Rail Operations|date=August 27, 2002|url=http://www.njtransit.com/tm/tm_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=PressReleaseTo&PRESS_RELEASE_ID=527|accessdate=July 7, 2010}}</ref>

On June 22, 2010, the town of Lyndhurst put forward the proposal to buy the station depots at both Kingsland and sister [[Lyndhurst (NJT station)|Lyndhurst stations]]. The mayor of Lyndhurst, Richard DiLascio, said that the stations have seen better days and New Jersey Transit has no interest in renovating both buildings, rather selling both at a fee to the town of Lyndhurst. Design plans for Kingsland station look towards a new coffee shop, after repairing and renovating the building. The station would also be converted from its old subway tile to a newer retro look for the building, paid for by leasing the building. Because an average of 440 of over 1,000 people use the Kingsland station daily, it would look better for the town of Lyndhurst to make a good impression on the riders.<ref name="sale">{{cite news|url=http://leadernewspapers.net/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=12991&new_topic=18|title=Lyndhurst may purchase train stations|last=Moeller|first=Susan C.|date=June 22, 2010|work=The Leader|publisher=The Leader|accessdate=7 July 2010|location=[[Lyndhurst, New Jersey]]}}</ref>
