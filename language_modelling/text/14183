A '''racing bicycle''', also known as a '''road bike''', is a [[bicycle]] designed for competitive [[Road bicycle racing|road cycling]], a sport governed by according to the rules of the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI). The UCI rules were altered in 1934 to exclude [[recumbent bicycle]]s. 

The most important characteristics about a racing bicycle are its weight and [[stiffness]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} which determine the efficiency at which the power from a rider's pedal strokes can be transferred to the drive-train and subsequently to its wheels. To this effect racing bicycles may sacrifice comfort for speed. The drop [[handlebar]]s are positioned lower than the [[saddle]] in order to put the rider in a more aerodynamic posture. The front and back wheels are close together so the bicycle has quick handling. The [[derailleur gear]] ratios are closely-spaced so that the rider can pedal at his or her optimum [[Cadence (cycling)|cadence]]. Other racing bicycles, especially those used in [[Individual time trial|time trialling]] prioritize aerodynamics over comfort.

== Distinction between racing bicycles and others ==
Bicycles for racing on [[velodrome]]s are [[track bicycle]]s; bicycles for racing offroad are [[mountain bicycle]]s, [[cyclo-cross bicycle]]s or [[cycle speedway]] bicycles; bicycles that race according to the rules of the [[International Human Powered Vehicle Association]] include faired [[recumbent bicycle]]s which, on flat ground, are the fastest bicycles in the world.<ref>{{cite web

[[Time trial bicycle]]s are a subset of racing bicycles that are designed for [[time trial]] events.  The UCI rules for these bikes are slightly less prescriptive than those for "massed start road races".  (See rules 1.3.020 to 1.3.023)

[[Triathlon]] bicycles are governed by [[International Triathlon Union]] (ITU) rules, which allow more recent technological developments than do the UCI rules.

== Racing wheels and tires ==
The [[bicycle wheel|wheels]] greatly affect the [[bicycle performance|performance]] of a racing bike. The rim of the wheel can be shaped for greater aerodynamic efficiency making a triangular cross-section to form a teardrop with the [[Bicycle tire|tire]]. For hill climbs, however, energy losses due to the higher weight of most aerodynamic rims are greater than the aerodynamic drag reduction that they offer, so a traditional lighter box-sectioned rim is often used.

Wheel [[moment of inertia]] is a controversial subject. In this article: [http://www.biketechreview.com/archive/wheel_theory.htm wheel theory], the author does some calculations on wheel effects.  Moment of inertia changes result in a decrease in watts of between .004 and .022%, while lower mass provided between .2 and .46%, and better aerodynamics provided between .6 and 1.8% decrease in wattage.  Therefore, wheel moment of inertia effects are neither noticeable nor important. At the same time, a product launched in 2008 to dynamically alter the rotating inertia of bicycle wheels claims to have "outperformed the standard, equivalent wheel by 5.6sec/mile."<ref>{{cite web

For aerodynamics and rotating weight, it is generally better to reduce the number of [[spoke]]s in the wheel. For high-end wheelsets, the spokes can be shaped to have a bladed cross-section, further reducing wind resistance.

The most common material for a wheel rim is [[aluminium|aluminum]] alloy, with molded [[Carbon fiber reinforced plastic|carbon fiber]] rims being a popular choice for pro-level racers and enthusiasts due to its weight reduction compared to a metal rim.  Using exotic materials, race-grade wheelsets are very expensive.  Riders who race often choose to own at least two pairs of wheels: a heavier, more durable, and cheaper wheelset for training, and a lighter, more aerodynamic wheelset for racing.

To reduce both air resistance and [[rolling resistance]] on the road, tires are lightweight, narrow, and have a thin, smooth tread. They are inflated to a high pressure, typically around 8 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (820[[kPa]]/120[[pound-force per square inch|psi]]); track racing tires can be inflated up to circa 14 bar. Until recently, most racing bikes used [[tubular tyre|tubular tires]] which have no beads: they are sewn around the tube and glued to the rim. These tires provide an advantage in weight (lacking the relatively heavy wire bead), rolling resistance, grip and pinch flat protection, but their greatest advantage lies in the ability to use a very lightweight simple box-section rim, rather than the U-shaped clincher rim.  A U-shaped clincher rim must use relatively heavier gauge to prevent the tire pressure from spreading the inherently weak U shape and allowing the tire to come off the rim.  Advances in tire technology, however, have seen the far more practical (due to greater ease of changeability) [[Bicycle_tire#Clincher|clincher]] (beaded) tire close the gap.  Some manufacturers create tubular-clincher tires, where the tires are sewn around the tubes and have a bead, but there is some debate as to the effectiveness of a tubular-clincher tire. Proponents believe that it has all the advantages of a tubular tire made to fit a clincher rim, but critics argue that the design includes disadvantages inherent to both systems---the rim weight is still high, the tire is more expensive than a standard clincher tire, and repairing a puncture on a tubular clincher is as inconvenient as it is with a standard tubular tire. However, a particular benefit of the tubular-clincher design is that the risk of pinch flats is very low (like the tubular tire), yet it allows the use of the more popular clincher wheel.

==Racing components==
{{RoadBikeComponents}}Race bike components (excluding frame, fork, wheelset, bars, stem, pedals, saddle and seatpost) are collectively referred to as the [[groupset]]. The quality of the groupset determines how refined the bike feels, how much maintenance it requires, and contributes to the performance of the bike. The two major groupset manufacturers of complete groupsets for racing bicycles are [[Shimano]] and [[Campagnolo]]. In 2006 [[SRAM (bicycles)|SRAM]] introduced their ''Force'' and ''Rival'' racing groupsets [http://willyoumaketheleap.com/]. The companies have different design philosophies, and some cyclists have great brand loyalty for one or the other.
In the early 1990s, [[Shimano]] introduced dual-control with a system called [[Shimano Total Integration]] (STI). STI is characterized by its combined brake and [[shifter (bicycle part)|shift levers]], or "brifters".  Previously, the shifters were mounted on the stem, handlebar ends or the down tube of the frame. Dual control addressed the problem of having to reposition a hand to change gears. STI was followed by the competing [[Campagnolo]]/Sachs [[Ergo Shifting|Ergolever]].  Other than this, the general design of a racing bicycle has changed little since the development of derailleurs.

The road groupset levels that these companies offer are as follows, from highest to lowest level. The number in the brackets indicates the number of cogs on the freewheel.
Shimano: Dura-Ace (10s), Ultegra SL (10s), Ultegra (10s), 105 (10s), Tiagra (9s), SORA (9s), 2300 (8s).
Campagnolo: Super Record (11s), Record (11s), Chorus (11s), Athena (11s), Centaur (10s), Veloce (10s), Mirage (10s), Xenon (10s).
SRAM: Red (10s), Force (10s), Rival (10s), Apex(10s).

In the mid 1990s [[Mavic]], known for their wheelsets, introduced an [[Electronic Gear-Shifting System|electronic shifting system]] which was pioneered in the [[Tour de France]] by American [[Greg LeMond]] and later on by Briton [[Chris Boardman]], who liked the fact that the system allowed him to shift from his [[Bicycle handlebar#Triathlon or aero|aerobars]] and his brake levers.  The system did not catch on due to technological hurdles.

In early March 2006, some pro riders were seen riding with Shimano electronic shifting groupsets; further testing in the pro-ranks continued during the next 2 years.  In late 2009, Shimano released their electronically shifted Dura-Ace Di2 groupset, consisting of battery powered, servo actuated front and rear derailleurs controlled wirelessly by electronic bar-end or brake lever integrated shifting paddles. Other components such as the crankset and brakeset are carryovers from the standard Dura-Ace 7900 group.

Recently in 2010, Campagnolo officially announced the finalization of their yet to be named electronic shifting groupset.  Unveiled as part of the new Pinarello Dogma Giro d'Italia road bike, the new electronic groupset appears to be similar in structure to Shimano's Dura Ace Di2 groupset in that it combines existing top of the line 11 speed Super Record parts such as the crankset and brakeset with new battery powered, servo actuated front and rear derailleurs controlled wirelessly by an electronic Ergopower styled brake lever/shifter.  No specific details about the operation, performance or pricing of the groupset have been released, but Campagnolo did announce that the Spanish Movistar cycling team will be the first professional team to use their electronic gear system in 2011.

[[Carbon fiber reinforced plastic|Carbon fiber]] has also become more popular for components.  Shimano, Campagnolo and SRAM have introduced carbon fiber for their high-end shifters and brake levers, cranks, and parts of their [[derailleur]]s.  Carbon fiber stems, handlebars, shoe soles, forks and seatposts are also more commonplace, including integrated stem/handlebar combinations. The advantages of carbon fiber are low weight as well as increased vibration dampening leading to a more comfortable ride.

==Other uses==
For [[recreational cycling|recreational]] road cycling, the racing-style bicycles with drop handlebars used to be the norm in the 80s, along with the ''[[touring bicycle]]'', (a drop-handlebar bike with a slightly longer wheelbase to provide a smoother ride and less sensitivity to steer and balance disturbances).  These designs, called "road bikes" or colloquially, "roadies" or "racing bikes", have become less popular in recent years. The [[Mountain bike]] geometry with its straight handle bar and comfortable sitting position (resembling the [[city bike]]), have moved into the high-performance spaces, and high production volumes have brought down costs significantly. 

Owing to the lower air resistance and better body stance for pushing, road bicycles tend to be  more efficient for use on smooth roads. [[Cyclo-cross bicycle]]s, which are used for racing on off-road circuits, are closer to racing bikes than to mountain bikes. They have wider, treaded tires and cantilever brakes instead of caliper brakes but are still less efficient than racing bikes at higher speeds.

==UCI rules==
The UCI rules currently specify<ref>{{cite web

The top tube may slope, provided that this element fits within a horizontal template defined by a maximum height of 16&nbsp;cm and a minimum thickness of 2.5&nbsp;cm

Note that the regulations regarding the dimensions of the bike are allowed exception, given that the rider can demonstrate a morphological need for the exception based on limb size or other factors.

These rules effectively and purposely rule out [[recumbent bicycle]]s, and have done so since 1934, after manufacturers of upright bicycles had lobbied to have recumbent bicycles out-lawed.

== Racing bicycles for non-competitive use ==
Racing bicycles are built for casual recreational use, often labelled as "sportif" bicycles or "dropped-bar fitness bikes".  These have much in common with a competitive racing bicycle, but the frame geometry is relaxed to make the bicycle more comfortable over long distances, though less effective for short bursts of speed; as such, they usually have more gear combinations and fewer hi-tech racing features.<ref>{{cite book
