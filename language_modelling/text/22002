'''Mont Granier''' is a [[limestone]] mountain located between the [[Departments_of_France|d<U+00E9>partements]] of [[Savoie]] and [[Is<U+00E8>re]] in [[France]]. It lies in the [[Chartreuse Mountains]] range between the towns of [[Chapareillan]] and [[Entremont-le-Vieux]]. It has an altitude of  1933 metres above sea level.  Its east face overlooks the valley of [[Gr<U+00E9>sivaudan]] and Combe de Savoie, and the north face overlooks [[Chamb<U+00E9>ry]].  At 900 meters, Mont Granier is among one of the highest cliffs in France.

==Catastrophic 1248 Landslide==
In the year 1248, between November 24-25, the face of the mountain broke off, causing a massive [[landslide]] that crushed many villages at the base & killed over a thousand people.  This event created the sheer 700m north face of the mountain.  

Five villages were completely destroyed by the avalanche:
* Cognin
* Vourey
* Saint-Andr<U+00E9>
* Granier
* Saint-P<U+00E9>range (also called Saint-P<U+00E9>ran)

Two villages were partially destroyed:
* Myans
* Les Murs (Les Marches)

==Activities==

It is a popular spot for hiking, spelunking, rock climbing, and [[BASE jumping]].  There are many tunnels and caves inside the mountain that have been carved over time by water.

On November 13, 1988, spelunkers Pierre Guichebaron and Marc Papet discovered the Balme Collomb cave on the west side of the mountain at an altitude of 5,577 feet (1,700 meters) that contained the skeletons of over 1,000 [[Cave_bear|cave bears]] that date between 24,000 and 45,000 years.

Around the base of Mont Granier are many vineyards that produce the [[Apremont,_Savoie|Apremont]] and Abymes [[Appellation|appellations]].  These wines are made from the white [[Jacqu<U+00E8>re]] grape, unknown outside [[Savoie]].
