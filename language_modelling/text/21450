The '''University of Oxford''' (informally referred to as '''Oxford University''' or  simply '''Oxford''') is a [[collegiate university|collegiate]] [[research university]] located in [[Oxford]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]. 

Although its exact date of foundation is unclear, there is evidence of teaching as far back as 1096,<ref name="OxHist"/> making it the oldest university in the [[English-speaking world]], and the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|second-oldest surviving university]] in the world, after the [[University of Bologna]].<ref name="OxHist"/><ref>Sager, Peter (2005).

In [[Post-nominal letters|post-nominals]], the University of Oxford is commonly abbreviated as "'''Oxon.'''", from the Latin ''Universitas Oxoniensis''. Since 2007, "'''Oxf'''" has been used in official university publications, though this "has been criticized by some readers".<ref>[http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/global/wwwoxacuk/localsites/gazette/documents/universitycalendar/Calendar_Style_Guide_2012.pdf  "''Oxford University Calendar'':].

==History==
===Founding===
[[Image:Oxford - Balliol College - geograph.org.uk - 1329613.jpg|right|thumb|[[Balliol College]] - one of the university's oldest constituent colleges.]]
The University of Oxford has no known foundation date. Teaching at Oxford existed in some form in 1096, but it is unclear at what point a university came into being.<ref name="OxHist"/>

The expulsion of foreigners from the [[University of Paris]] in 1167 caused many English scholars to return from France and settle in Oxford. The historian [[Gerald of Wales]] lectured to such scholars in 1188, and the first known foreign scholar, [[Emo of Friesland]], arrived in 1190. The head of the University was named a [[chancellor]] from at least 1201, and the masters were recognised as a ''universitas'' or corporation in 1231.

[[File:John Speed's map of Oxford, 1605..jpg|thumb|left|In 1605 Oxford was still a walled city, but several colleges had been built outside the city walls. (North is at the bottom on this map.)]]
The students associated together on the basis of geographical origins, into two "[[Nation (university)|nations]]", representing the North (including the [[Scots people|Scots]]) and the South (including the Irish and the [[Welsh people|Welsh]]). In later centuries, geographical origins continued to influence many students' affiliations when membership of a [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|college]] or [[Permanent Private Hall|hall]] became customary in Oxford. In addition to this, members of many [[religious order]]s, including [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Franciscan]]s, [[Carmelites]], and [[Augustinians]], settled in Oxford in the mid-13th century, gained influence, and maintained houses for students. At about the same time, private benefactors established colleges to serve as self-contained scholarly communities. Among the earliest such founders were [[William of Durham]], who in 1249 endowed [[University College, Oxford|University College]], and [[John I de Balliol|John Balliol]], father of a future [[John of Scotland|King of Scots]]; [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] bears his name. Another founder, [[Walter de Merton]], a [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]] of England and afterwards [[Bishop of Rochester]], devised a series of regulations for college life; [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]] thereby became the model for such establishments at Oxford, as well as at the University of Cambridge. Thereafter, an increasing number of students forsook living in halls and religious houses in favour of living in colleges.

In 1333<U+2013>34, an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]] was blocked by the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning king [[Edward III]].<ref>May McKisack, The Fourteenth Century, Oxford History of England, p. 501</ref> Thereafter until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to start in England, even in London; and, subsequently, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly unusual in western European countries.<ref>Daniel J. Boorstin. (1958.) ''The Americans; the Colonial Experience'', Vintage, pp. [http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/learn/99AHLstuff.htm/Boorstin.htm 171<U+2013>184].</ref><ref>Christopher Nugent Lawrence Brooke. (1988.) ''Oxford and Cambridge'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, p. 56.</ref>

===Renaissance period===
[[Image:Magdalen-may-morning-2007-panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Magdalen College]] - founded in the mid 15th century.]]
The new learning of the [[Renaissance]] greatly influenced Oxford from the late 15th century onwards. Among university scholars of the period were [[William Grocyn]], who contributed to the revival of [[Greek language]] studies, and [[John Colet]], the noted [[Biblical Theology|biblical scholar]].

With the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the breaking of ties with the Roman Catholic Church, [[Recusancy|Recusant]] scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the [[University of Douai]]. The method of teaching at Oxford was transformed from the medieval [[Scholasticism|Scholastic method]] to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university suffered losses of land and revenues.

In 1636, [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] [[William Laud]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], codified the university's statutes. These, to a large extent, remained its governing regulations until the mid-19th century. Laud was also responsible for the granting of a charter securing privileges for the [[Oxford University Press|University Press]], and he made significant contributions to the [[Bodleian Library]], the main library of the university. From the inception of the [[Church of England]] until 1866, membership of the church was a requirement to receive the B.A. degree from Oxford, and "[[dissenter]]s" were only permitted to receive the M.A. in 1871.

The university was a centre of the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] party during the [[English Civil War]] (1642<U+2013>1649), while the town favoured the opposing [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] cause. From the mid-18th century onwards, however, the University of Oxford took little part in political conflicts.

===Modern period===
[[File:ChristChurchOxfordEngraving1742.jpg|thumb|left|An engraving of Christ Church, Oxford, 1742.]]
The mid-nineteenth century saw the impact of the [[Oxford Movement]] (1833<U+2013>1845), led among others by the future [[Cardinal Newman]]. The influence of the reformed model of German university reached Oxford via key scholars such as [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]], [[Benjamin Jowett]] and [[Max M<U+00FC>ller]].

The system of separate [[Honour Moderations|honour schools]] for different subjects began in 1802, with ''Mathematics'' and ''[[Literae Humaniores]]''.<ref name="boase"/> Schools for ''Natural Sciences'' and ''Law, and Modern History'' were added in 1853.<ref name="boase">{{cite book |pages=208<U+2013>209 |last=Boase |first=Charles William |year=1887 |title=Oxford |edition=2nd |url=http://purl.ox.ac.uk/uuid/743404c6bb6c4b16880e9dfce4000622  |accessdate=3 February 2013}}</ref> By 1872, the latter was split into ''Jurisprudence'' and ''Modern History''; and, ''Theology'' became the sixth honour school.<ref>{{Citation| title = The New Examination Statues | publisher = Clarendon Press | place = Oxford | year = 1872 | url = http://purl.ox.ac.uk/uuid/4a66e363bf9544a8b81e48fe1335e4f6| accessdate =4 February 2013 }}</ref> In addition to these B.A. Honours degrees, the postgraduate [[Bachelor of Civil Law|Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.)]] was, and still is, offered.<ref>{{Citation| title = The New Examination Statues | publisher = Clarendon Press | place = Oxford | year = 1873 | url = http://purl.ox.ac.uk/uuid/0ccd63bb36204432baafdcd706508ea4| accessdate =4 February 2013 }}</ref>

Administrative reforms during the 19th century included the replacement of oral examinations with written entrance tests, greater tolerance for [[English Dissenters|religious dissent]], and the establishment of four women's colleges.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} 20th-century Privy Council decisions (e.g., the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of theological bequests to colleges to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Furthermore, although the university's emphasis traditionally had been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded in the course of the 19th century to encompass [[science|scientific]] and medical studies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Knowledge of [[Ancient Greek]] was required for admission until 1920, and Latin until 1960.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The mid-20th century saw many distinguished continental scholars, displaced by Nazism and Communism, relocating to Oxford.

The list of distinguished scholars at the University of Oxford is long and includes many who have made major contributions to [[Politics of the United Kingdom|British politics]], the sciences, medicine, and literature. More than 40 Nobel laureates and more than 50 [[World Leaders|world leaders]] have been affiliated with the University of Oxford.<ref name="Famous"/>

===Women's education===
[[Image:Somerville College.jpg|thumb|left|[[Somerville College]] was founded as one of Oxford's first women's colleges in 1879, it is now fully co-educational.]]
The University passed a Statute in 1875 allowing its delegates to create examinations for women at roughly undergraduate level.<ref name="Lannon">Frances Lannon [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/404111.article "Her Oxford",] ''Times Higher Education'', 30 October 2008</ref> The first four women's colleges were established thanks to the activism of the Association for Promoting the Higher Education of Women (AEW). [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]] (1878)<ref>[http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/About-LMH/College-history.aspx "History"], Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford</ref> was followed by [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]] in 1879;<ref>[http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/199/all/1/History.aspx "History"], Somerville College, University of Oxford</ref> the first 21 students from Somerville and Lady Margaret Hall attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker's shop.<ref name="Lannon"/> The first two colleges for women were followed by [[St Hugh's College, Oxford|St Hugh's]] (1886),<ref>[http://www.st-hughs.ox.ac.uk/about-sthughs/history-of-the-college "History of the College"], St Hugh's College, University of Oxford</ref> [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]] (1893)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.st-hildas.ox.ac.uk/index.php/history/histconst.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120423094628/http://www.st-hildas.ox.ac.uk/index.php/history/histconst.html |archivedate=23 April 2012 |title=Constitutional History |publisher=St Hilda's College |accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref> and [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's College]] (1952).<ref>[http://www.st-annes.ox.ac.uk/about/st-annes-history.html "St Anne's History"], St Anne's College, University of Oxford</ref> Oxford was long considered a bastion of male privilege,<ref>Joyce S. Pedersen [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=453 Book review], H-Albion, May 1996, reprinted on H-Net Review website</ref> and it was not until 7 October 1920 that women became eligible for admission as full members of the university and were given the right to take degrees.<ref>1965. <U+2013> ''Handbook to the University of Oxford''. <U+2013> University of Oxford. <U+2013> p.43.</ref> In 1927 the University's dons created a quota<ref>{{cite journal | url = https://www.oxfordtoday.ox.ac.uk/page.aspx?pid=1044 | journal = Oxford Today | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | date = Hilary 2009 | title = A woman's place | author = Judy Batson}}</ref> that limited the number of female students to a quarter that of men, a ruling which was not abolished until 1957.<ref name="Lannon"/> However, before the 1970s all Oxford colleges were for men or women only, so that the number of women was effectively limited by the capacity of the women's colleges to admit students. It was not until 1959 that the women's colleges were given full collegiate status.

In 1974, [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose]], [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus]], [[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham]], [[Hertford College, Oxford|Hertford]] and [[St Catherine's College, Oxford|St Catherine's]] became the first previously all-male colleges to admit women.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/1998-9/weekly/290799/news/story_3.htm | title = Colleges mark anniversary of 'going mixed' | date = 29 July 1999 | publisher = [[Oxford University Gazette]]}}</ref><ref name="Women_at_Oxford">{{cite web | url = http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/introducing_oxford/women_at_oxford/index.html | title = Women at Oxford | publisher = University of Oxford | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6678DAEL2 | archivedate=12 March 2012 }}</ref>

In 2008, the last single-sex college, St Hilda's, admitted its first men, meaning all colleges are now co-residential. By 1988, 40% of undergraduates at Oxford were female;<ref>Jenifer Hart [http://www.jstor.org/pss/1050413 "Women at Oxford since the Advent of Mixed Colleges",] ''Oxford Review of Education'', 15:3, 1989, p.217</ref> the ratio is now about 48:52 in men's favour.

The detective novel ''[[Gaudy Night]]'' by [[Dorothy Sayers]], herself one of the first women to gain an academic degree from Oxford, takes place in a (fictional) women's college at Oxford, and the issue of women's education is central to its plot.

==Buildings, collections, and facilities==

===Main sites===
[[File:Chemistry Research Laboratory Atrium.JPG|thumb|The atrium of the Chemistry Research Laboratory. The university has invested heavily in new facilities in recent years.]]
The University is a "city university" in that it does not have a main campus; instead, colleges, departments, accommodation, and other facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. The [[Science Area, Oxford|Science Area]], in which most science departments are located, is the area that bears closest resemblance to a campus. The ten-acre [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] in the northwest of the city is currently under development. However, the larger colleges' sites are of similar size to these areas.

Iconic university buildings include the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] used for music concerts, lectures, and university ceremonies, and [[Examination Schools]], where examinations and some lectures take place. The [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin]] was used for university ceremonies before the construction of the Sheldonian. [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford|Christ Church Cathedral]] uniquely serves as both a college chapel and as a cathedral.

In 2012, the University embarked on the controversial one-hectare (400m <U+00D7> 25m) [[Castle Mill]] development of 4<U+2013>5 storey blocks of student flats overlooking [[Cripley Meadow]] and the historic [[Port Meadow]], blocking views of the spires in the city centre.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/universities-and-colleges/9912968/Philip-Pullman-campaigns-for-demolition-of-brutal-new-Oxford-University-buildings.html| title=Philip Pullman condemns Port Meadow buildings | first=Gordon | last=Rayner | date=6 March 2013 | newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref> The development has been likened to building a "skyscraper beside [[Stonehenge]]".<ref>{{cite news| title=Historian takes university to task over 'visual disaster' of Port Meadow flats |first=Reg | last=Little | newspaper=The Oxford Times| page=3 | date=7 February 2013 }}</ref>

[[File:Pitt-rivers-m2.jpg|thumb|upright|The interior of the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]]]]
Adjoining the Museum of Natural History is the [[Pitt Rivers Museum]], founded in 1884, which displays the University<U+2019>s archaeological and anthropological collections, currently holding over 500,000 items. It recently built a new research annexe; its staff have been involved with the teaching of anthropology at Oxford since its foundation, when as part of his donation General [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]] stipulated that the University establish a lectureship in anthropology.

The [[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford|Museum of the History of Science]] is housed on Broad St in the world<U+2019>s oldest-surviving purpose-built museum building.<ref>{{cite web |title=

In the Faculty of Music on [[St Aldate's, Oxford|St Aldate's]] is the [[Bate Collection]] of Musical Instruments, a collection mostly of instruments from Western classical music, from the medieval period onwards. [[Christ Church Picture Gallery]] holds a collection of over 200 [[old master]] paintings.

===Parks===
[[File:Oxford Botanic Garden in Autumn 2004.jpg|thumb|left|Autumn in the [[Oxford Botanic Garden|Botanic Garden]].]]
The [[University Parks]] are a 70-acre parkland area in the northeast of city. It is open free of charge to the public during daylight hours. As well as providing beautiful gardens and rare and exotic plants, the parks contains numerous sports fields, used for official and unofficial fixtures. In addition to this, the University Parks contain sites of special interest including the Genetic Garden, an experimental garden to elucidate and investigate evolutionary processes.

The [[University of Oxford Botanic Garden|Botanic Garden]] on the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]] is the oldest [[botanical garden|botanic garden]] in the UK and the third-oldest scientific garden in the world. It contains over 8,000 different plant species on 1.8 hectares (4<U+00BD> acres). It is one of the most diverse yet compact collections of plants in the world and includes representatives from over 90% of the higher plant families. The [[Harcourt Arboretum]] is a 130-acre site six miles south of the city that includes native woodland and 67 acres of meadow. The 1,000-acre [[Wytham Woods]] are owned by the University and used or research in [[zoology]] and [[climate change]].

There are also various collegiate-owned open spaces open to the public, including [[Bagley Wood]] and most notably [[Christ Church Meadow, Oxford|Christ Church Meadow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/395-732/Biological-Sciences-.html |title=Biological Sciences - St John's College Oxford |publisher=Sjc.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>

==Organisation== <!-- "s" spelling per talk page consensus on 20 April 2009 -->
{{See also|Category:Departments of the University of Oxford}}
As a [[collegiate university]], Oxford's structure can be confusing to those unfamiliar with it. The university is a federation, comprising over forty self-governing [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|colleges]] and [[Permanent Private Hall|halls]], along with a central administration headed by the [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Vice-Chancellor]].

Academic departments are located centrally within the structure of the federation; they are not affiliated with any particular college. Departments provide facilities for teaching and research, determine the syllabi and guidelines for the teaching of students, perform research, and deliver lectures and seminars.

Colleges arrange the tutorial teaching for their undergraduates, and the members of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., [[Nuffield College]] as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the [[Bodleian]]), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).

===Affiliations===
[[File:Sheldonian Theatre Oxford.jpg|thumb|The [[Sheldonian Theatre]], built by [[Sir Christopher Wren]] between 1664 and 1668, hosts the University's [[Congregation (university)|Congregation]], as well as concerts and degree ceremonies.]]

Oxford is a member of the [[Russell Group]] of research-led [[Universities in the United Kingdom|British universities]], the [[Coimbra Group]], the [[G5 (education)|G5]], the [[League of European Research Universities]], and the [[International Alliance of Research Universities]]. It is also a core member of the [[Europaeum]] and forms part of the "[[Golden triangle (universities)|golden triangle]]" of British universities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/2005/050707/full/nj7047-144a.html| title=Golden opportunities|accessdate=19 October 2010|publisher=Nature| date=6 July 2005}}</ref>

===Central governance===
The university's formal head is the [[List of Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Chancellor]]{{anchor|Chancellor of the University of Oxford}}, currently [[Chris Patten|Lord Patten of Barnes]], though as at most British universities, the Chancellor is a titular figure, and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The Chancellor is elected by the members of [[Convocation]], a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.

[[Image:Wellington Square Oxford 1.jpg|thumb|left|Wellington Square, the name of which has become synonymous with the university's central administration.]]
The [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Vice-Chancellor]], currently [[Andrew D. Hamilton|Andrew Hamilton]], is the ''de facto'' head of the University. Five Pro-Vice-Chancellors have specific responsibilities for Education; Research; Planning and Resources; Development and External Affairs; and Personnel and Equal Opportunities. The University Council is the executive policy-forming body, which consists of the Vice-Chancellor as well as heads of departments and other members elected by Congregation, in addition to observers from the [[OUSU|Student Union]]. [[Congregation (university)|Congregation]], the "parliament of the dons", comprises over 3,700 members of the University<U+2019>s academic and administrative staff, and has ultimate responsibility for legislative matters: it discusses and pronounces on policies proposed by the University Council. Only Oxford and Cambridge (which is similarly structured) have this democratic form of governance.

Two university [[Proctor#Oxford University|proctors]], who are elected annually on a rotating basis from two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes. This role incorporates student welfare and discipline, as well as oversight of the university's proceedings. The University Professors are collectively referred to as the Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford. They are particularly influential in the running of the university's graduate programmes. Examples of Statutory Professors are the [[Chichele Professorship]]s and the Drummond Professor of Political Economy. The various academic faculties, departments, and institutes are organised into four divisions, each with its own Head and elected board. They are the [[Humanities Division, University of Oxford|Humanities Division]]; the Social Sciences Division; the Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division; and the [[Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford|Medical Sciences Division]].

The University of Oxford is a "public university" in the sense that it receives some public money from the government, but it is a "private university" in the sense that it is entirely self-governing and, in theory, could choose to become entirely private by rejecting public funds.<ref name='OXCHEPS39'>{{cite web | url = http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/MainSite%20pages/Resources/OxCHEPS_OP39.pdf | title = OFFA and <U+00A3>6000-9000 tuition fees | accessdate =20 March 2011 | last = Dennis | first = Farrington | coauthors = David Palfreyman | date = 21 February 2011 | format = PDF | work = OxCHEPS Occasional Paper No. 39 | publisher = Oxford Centre for Higher Education Policy Studies | quote = Note, however, that any university which does not want funding from HEFCE can, as a private corporation, charge whatever tuition fees it likes (exactly as does, say, the University of Buckingham or BPP University College). Under existing legislation and outside of the influence of the HEFCE-funding mechanism upon universities, Government can no more control university tuition fees than it can dictate the price of socks in Marks & Spencer. Universities are not part of the State and they are not part of the public sector; Government has no reserve powers of intervention even in a failing institution. }}</ref>

===Colleges===

To be a member of the university, all students, and most academic staff, must also be a member of a college or hall. There are 38 [[colleges of the University of Oxford]] and six [[Permanent Private Hall]]s, each controlling its membership and with its own internal structure and activities.<ref name=CollegesandHalls>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/colleges/colleges_and_halls_az/index.html|title=Colleges and Halls A-Z|publisher=University of Oxford |accessdate=4 October 2008}}</ref> Not all colleges offer all courses, but they generally cover a broad range of subjects.

The Permanent Private Halls were founded by different Christian denominations. One difference between a college and a PPH is that whereas the former are governed by the fellows of the college, the governance of a PPH resides, at least in part, with the corresponding Christian denomination. The six current PPHs are:

The PPHs and colleges  join together as the Conference of Colleges, which represents the common concerns of the several [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|colleges]] of the University, and to discuss policy and to deal with the central University administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.confcoll.ox.ac.uk/ |title=Conference of Colleges |publisher=Confcoll.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://weblearn.ox.ac.uk/access/content/group/test1-conf-coll/Public%20Documents/conf_coll_leaflet_web%20final.pdf | title = Who we are, what we do - The Conference of Colleges | publisher = Oxford University | format = PDF | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6DN1K4kio | archivedate = 2013-01-02}}</ref> The Conference of Colleges was established as a recommendation of the [[Oliver Franks, Baron Franks|Franks]] Commission in 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/councilsec/gov/gov_expl/ |title=A brief history and overview of the University's governance arrangements (see footnote 1) |publisher=Admin.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>

Teaching members of the colleges (i.e., fellows and tutors) are collectively and familiarly known as "dons", although the term is rarely used by the University itself. In addition to residential and dining facilities, the colleges provide social, cultural, and recreational activities for their members. Colleges have responsibility for admitting undergraduates and organising their tuition; for graduates, this responsibility falls upon the departments. There is no common title for the heads of colleges; the names used include warden, provost, principal, president, rector, master and dean.

In 2011/12, the University had an income of <U+00A3>1,016m; key sources were research grants (<U+00A3>409m), teaching funding (<U+00A3>204m), and academic fees (<U+00A3>173m).<ref name="financial-statements">{{Citation | year = 2012 | title = 2011/12 Financial Statements | publisher = University of Oxford | publication-place = Oxford | url = http://www.ox.ac.uk/document.rm?id=2741 | accessdate = 2013-03-17 }}</ref> The colleges had a total income of <U+00A3>361m,<ref>{{cite web |title= Philanthropic support vital to health of Oxford's colleges |work=University of Oxford |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2012/120307.html |date=7 March 2012 |accessdate=17 March 2012}}</ref> of which <U+00A3>47m was flow-through from the University.<ref name="financial-statements"/>

===Teaching and degrees===
{{Main|Degrees of the University of Oxford|List of professorships at the University of Oxford}}
[[Image:Encaenia 2009 Radcliffe square.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Members of the University Congregation pass through Radcliffe square after [[Encaenia]].]]
Undergraduate teaching is centred on the tutorial, where 1<U+2013>4 students spend an hour with an academic discussing their week<U+2019>s work, usually an essay (humanities, most social sciences, some mathematical, physical, and life sciences) or problem sheet (most mathematical, physical, and life sciences, and some social sciences). Students usually have one or two tutorials a week, and can be taught by academics at any other college<U+2014>not just their own<U+2014>as expertise and personnel require. These tutorials are complemented by lectures, classes and seminars, which are organised on a departmental basis. Graduate students undertaking taught degrees are usually instructed through classes and seminars, though there is more focus upon individual research.

The university itself is responsible for conducting examinations and conferring degrees. The passing of two sets of examinations is a prerequisite for a first degree. The first set of examinations, called either Honour Moderations ("Mods" and "Honour Mods") or Preliminary Examinations ("Prelims"), are usually held at the end of the first year (after two terms for those studying [[Bachelor of Laws|Law]]; [[Bachelor of Theology|Theology]]; Philosophy and Theology; Experimental Psychology; or [[Psychology, Philosophy and Physiology]] or after five terms in the case of [[Classics]]). The second set of examinations, the Final Honour School ("Finals"), is held at the end of the undergraduate course (for humanities and most social sciences) or at the end of each successive year of the course after the first (most mathematical, physical and life sciences, and some social sciences). Successful candidates receive [[First-Class Honours|first-]], [[Upper second-class honours|upper]] or [[Lower second-class honours|lower second-]], or [[Third-class honours|third-class]] honours, or simply a "pass" without honours, based on their performance in Finals. An upper second is the most usual result, and a first is often prerequisite for graduate study. A "double first" reflects first-class results in both Honour Moderations and Finals.

As a matter of tradition, bachelor's degree graduates are eligible, after seven years from matriculation (formal induction of students into the university) and without additional study, to purchase for a nominal fee an upgrade of their bachelor's degree to an "MA" or Master of Arts. All MAs were members of Convocation; and, until 1913, all resident members of [[Convocation]] were members of [[Congregation (university)|Congregation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oua.ox.ac.uk/enquiries/congandconvthree.html |title=Oxford University Archives: A history of Congregation and Convocation, 3.

Research degrees at the master's and doctoral level are conferred in all subjects studied at graduate level at the university.

===Academic year===
[[File:Tom Quad, Christ Church 2004-01-21.jpg|thumb|[[Tom Quad]], [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] in the snow.]]
The academic year is divided into three [[Academic term|terms]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Regulations on the number and length of terms |work=University of Oxford |url=http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/examregs/03-00_REGULATIONS_ON_THE_NUMBER_AND_LENGTH_OF_TERMS.shtml |accessdate=9 October 2007 }}</ref> [[Michaelmas term|Michaelmas Term]] lasts from October to December; [[Hilary term|Hilary Term]] from January to March; and [[Trinity term|Trinity Term]] from April to June. Within each of these terms, Council determines an eight-week period called [[Full Term]], during which undergraduate teaching takes place. These teaching terms are shorter than those of many other British universities,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hepi.ac.uk/files/33TheacademicexperienceofstudentsinEnglishuniversities2007.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Academic Experience of Students in English Universities (2007 report)|publisher=Higher Education Policy Institute|last=Sastry |first=Tom|coauthors=Bekhradnia, Bahram |date=25 September 2007|pages=footnote 14|accessdate=4 November 2007|quote=Even within Russell Group institutions, it is remarkable how consistently Oxford and Cambridge appear to require more effort of their students than other universities. On the other hand, they have fewer weeks in the academic year than other universities, so the extent to which this is so may be exaggerated by these results.}}</ref> and the total duration of Full Terms amounts to less than half the year. However, undergraduates are also expected to do some academic work during the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacations).

Internally at least, the weeks in the term are often referred to by the time elapsed since the start of each Full Term: thus the first week of any Full Term is called "1st week" and the last is "8th week". The numbering of the weeks continues up to the end of the term, and begins again with negative numbering from the beginning of the succeeding term, through "minus first week" and "noughth week", which precede "1st week". These weeks begin on a Sunday. Undergraduates must be in residence from Thursday of 0th week.

==Undergraduate admissions==

===Age===
In line with the other UK universities, almost all students are aged 17 or over, and the majority commence undergraduate courses at 18 or 19. However there is no upper or lower limit on the age of those admitted. There is a college, [[Harris Manchester College, Oxford|Harris Manchester]], that caters only for students aged 21 or over.

Historically, it was common for boys to become members of the university between the ages of 14 and 19.<ref>John Hooper Harvey, ''Mediaeval craftsmen'' (Batsford, 1975), p. 45</ref> [[Jeremy Bentham]] matriculated in 1761 at the age of 13, which was unusually young.<ref>''Museum of foreign literature, science and art'', vol. 23, p. 322</ref> Much younger people are still occasionally admitted to the university if they are of the required standard; for example, [[Ruth Lawrence]] matriculated age 12 in 1983,<ref>{{cite news |title= Child prodigy Ruth tells why she's all tied up in knots |author=Charles Arthur |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/child-prodigy-ruth-tells-why-shes-all-tied-up-in-knots-1273133.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DFgLrke4 |archivedate=28 December 2012 |deadurl=no |newspaper=The Independent |date=Sunday 16 March 1997 |accessdate=28 December 2012}}</ref> as did [[Sufiah Yusof]] aged 13 in 1997.<ref>{{cite news |title= How a child prodigy at Oxford became a <U+00A3>130-an-hour prostitute |author=Andy Dolan |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-550549/How-child-prodigy-Oxford-130-hour-prostitute.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DFh2GI6E |archivedate=28 December 2012 |deadurl=no |newspaper=The Daily Mail |date=5 April 2008 |accessdate=28 December 2012}}</ref>

===Procedure===
[[File:Oxford University Coat Of Arms.svg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Arms of the University of Oxford|coat of arms]] of the university]]
In common with most British universities, prospective students apply through the [[UCAS]] application system; but, prospective applicants for the University of Oxford, along with those for medicine, dentistry, and [[University of Cambridge]] applicants, must observe an earlier deadline of 15 October.<ref>{{cite web |title=UCAS Students: Important dates for your diary |quote=15 October 2009 Last date for receipt of applications to Oxford University, University of Cambridge and courses in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science or veterinary medicine. |url=http://www.ucas.com/students/importantdates |accessdate=23 November 2009}}</ref>

To allow a more personalised judgement of students, who might otherwise apply for both, undergraduate applicants are not permitted to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same year. The only exceptions are applicants for [[organ scholar|Organ Scholarships]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.music.ox.ac.uk/assets/files/Chor_Org_Downloads/OrgAwards2009.pdf |quote=It is possible for a candidate to enter the comparable competition at Cambridge which is scheduled at the same time of year. |title=Organ Awards Information for Prospective Candidates|publisher=Faculty of Music, University of Oxford |accessdate=22 March 2009}}</ref> and those applying to read for a second undergraduate degree.<ref>{{cite web |title=UCAS Students FAQs: Oxford or Cambridge |quote=Is it possible to apply to both Oxford University and the University of Cambridge? |url=http://www.ucas.com/students/applying/faqs/eligibility/faq1 |accessdate=23 November 2009}}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref>

Students from all backgrounds are encouraged to apply, with "contextual data" (factors that may have influenced prior exam performance) taken into account during the admission procedure. The university believes that there are many potential students from less well-off backgrounds whom the university cannot admit simply because they do not apply.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7939230.stm |title=UK &#124; Education &#124; More state pupils head to Oxford |publisher=BBC News  |date=12 March 2009 |accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref>

Most applicants choose to apply to one of the individual colleges, which work with each other to ensure that the best students gain a place somewhere at the University regardless of their college preferences.<ref>{{cite web |title=How do I choose a college? <U+2013> Will I be interviewed only at my chosen college?|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/colleges/how_do_i_choose_a_college/index.html |publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=23 November 2009}}</ref> Shortlisting is based on achieved and predicted exam results; school references; and, in some subjects, written admission tests or candidate-submitted written work. Approximately 60% of applicants are shortlisted, although this varies by subject. If a large number of shortlisted applicants for a subject choose one college, then students who named that college may be reallocated randomly to under-subscribed colleges for the subject. The colleges then invite shortlisted candidates for interview, where they are provided with food and accommodation for around three days in December. Most applicants will be individually interviewed by academics at more than one college. Students from outside Europe can be interviewed remotely, for example, over the Internet.

In 2007, the colleges, faculties and departments published a "common framework" outlining the principles and procedures they observe.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Common Framework for colleges and faculties and departments |url=http://www.admissions.ox.ac.uk/news/common_framework.shtml |publisher=Undergraduate Admissions Office, University of Oxford |date=2 April 2007 |accessdate=23 November 2009}}</ref>

Offers are sent out shortly before Christmas (exceptionally, in early January for the 2012-13 admissions round), with an offer usually being from a specific college. One in four successful candidates receive offers from a college that they did not apply to. Some courses may make "open offers" to some candidates, who are not assigned to a particular college until [[A Level]] results day in August.<ref>{{cite web |title=Open Offer Scheme |url=http://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/aspsite/index.asp?pageid=462 |publisher=Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford |accessdate=23 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Open Offer Scheme |url=http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduates/faqs/faq-admissions |publisher=Department of Physics, University of Oxford |accessdate=27 March 2013}}</ref>

In 2007, the university refined its admissions procedure to take into account the academic performance of its applicants' schools.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Oxford digs deeper to seek out the best students |work=Observer |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/jul/22/highereducation.accesstouniversity |date=22 July 2007 |accessdate=9 October 2007 | location=London | first=Anushka | last=Asthana}}</ref>

[[Image:Oxford - Bridge of Sighs- Hertford College, Passes over New College Lane.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Hertford College, Oxford|Hertford College]]'s Bridge of Sighs. Hertford was one of the first colleges to encourage applicants from state schools through the Hertford Scheme.]]
Students who apply from [[state school]]s and colleges have an acceptance rate broadly comparable to those from independent schools (19% and 24% of applicants accepted respectively, 2010).<ref name="Admissions Statistics 2010">[http://www.ox.ac.uk/document.rm?id=1924 Undergraduate Admissions Statistics: 2010 entry]. Retrieved 12 April 2011.</ref> More than half of applications come from the state sector,<ref name="Admissions Statistics 2010"/> and the University of Oxford funds many initiatives to attract applicants from this sector, including the UNIQ Summer Schools, Oxford Young Ambassadors, Target Schools, and the FE Access Initiative.<ref name="Working with Schools and Colleges"/> Regarding the UNIQ Summer School, of all the UNIQ students who went on to make applications in autumn 2010 to enter the university in 2011/12, 39 per cent ended up with places. The overall success rate for Oxford applicants is around 20 per cent. Most colleges also run their own access schemes and initiatives.

The Oxford Admissions Study was a research project set up to investigate access issues, in which data were collected on 2,000 students who applied to the university in 2002, including exam results from the universities they went on to attend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onsir.ox.ac.uk/index.php/research/55-projects/112-oxford-admissions-study.html |title=The Oxford Admissions Study |doi=10.1080/01411920903165611 |publisher=Onsir.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-01-28}}</ref> A number of reports were published based on these data. It was found that, if anything, admissions tutors treat applicants from state schools more favourably than applicants from private schools with the same attainment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ora.ouls.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:0e9cf555-a921-4134-baf4-ce7114795f36 |title=ORA Thesis: "Challenges to meritocracy?

Contrastingly, participation in cultural activities such as visiting museums, art galleries, classical concerts, and ballet made no difference.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://soc.sagepub.com/content/43/4/648.abstract |title=Elite Higher Education Admissions in the Arts and Sciences: Is Cultural Capital the Key? |author=Amma Zimdars; Alice Sullivan; [[Anthony Heath]] |publisher=soc.sagepub.com }}</ref>

Veiled accusations of racism regarding the 2009 intake were dismissed on the grounds that ethnic minority applicants apply disproportionately more to the most competitive courses, and that black candidates had lower A-level scores nationally.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Wallace|first=David|work=The Guardian|title=Letters: Our education system's great shame|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/dec/14/education-shame-oxbridge-schools-race|date=14 December 2010|accessdate=6 October 2012|location=London}}</ref> However, further analysis of entrance figures for 2010 and 2011 by ''The Guardian'' reported what was termed an "institutional bias" in favour of white candidates; ethnic minority candidates had significantly lower success rates in individual subjects even when they had the same grades as white candidates. In medicine, for instance, ethnic minority applicants who went on to score three A* grades at A level were almost half as likely to gain admission as white applicants with similar grades.<ref>{{cite web |last1= Kurien |first1= Parel |last2= Ball |first2= James |date= 26 February 2013 |title= Oxford University accused of bias against ethnic minority applicants |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2013/feb/26/oxford-university-ethnic-minority-applicants |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 26 February 2013 }}</ref>

===Scholarships and financial support===
[[Image:RhodesHouseOxford20040909 CopyrightKaihsuTai.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rhodes House]] - home to the awarding body for the [[Rhodes Scholarships]], often considered to be "the world's most prestigious scholarship".]]
There are many opportunities for students at Oxford to receive financial help during their studies. The Oxford Opportunity Bursaries, introduced in 2006, are university-wide means-based bursaries available to any British undergraduate. With a total possible grant of <U+00A3>10,235 over a 3-year degree, it is the most generous [[bursary]] scheme offered by any British university.<ref>{{cite web |title=Oxford Opportunity Bursaries |work=University of Oxford |url=http://www.oxfordopportunity.com/ |accessdate=9 October 2007 }}</ref> In addition, individual colleges also offer bursaries and funds to help their students. For graduate study, there are many scholarships attached to the university, available to students from all sorts of backgrounds, from [[Rhodes Scholarships]] to the relatively new Weidenfeld Scholarships.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Oxford targets bright young things of eastern Europe |work=The Guardian |location=UK |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2007/mar/22/highereducation.internationaleducationnews |date=22 March 2007 |accessdate=9 October 2007  | first=Jessica | last=Shepherd}}</ref>

Students successful in early examinations are rewarded by their colleges with scholarships and [[exhibition (scholarship)|exhibitions]], normally the result of a long-standing endowment, although since the introduction of tuition fees the amounts of money available are purely nominal. Scholars, and exhibitioners in some colleges, are entitled to wear a more voluminous undergraduate gown; "commoners" (originally those who had to pay for their "commons", or food and lodging) being restricted to a short, sleeveless garment. The term "scholar" in relation to Oxford therefore had a specific meaning as well as the more general meaning of someone of outstanding academic ability. In previous times, there were "noblemen commoners" and "gentlemen commoners", but these ranks were abolished in the 19th century. "Closed" scholarships, available only to candidates who fitted specific conditions such as coming from specific schools, exist now only in name.

===Traditions===
{{See also|Academic dress of the University of Oxford}}
[[Image:Toby Virno sub fusc.JPG|thumb|upright|Sub Fusc|An undergraduate student at the University of Oxford in sub fusc for Matriculation.]]
[[Academic dress]] is required for examinations, matriculation, disciplinary hearings, and when visiting university officers. A referendum held amongst the Oxford student body in 2006 showed 81% against making it voluntary in examinations <U+2014> 4,382 voted in the poll, almost 1,000 more than voted in the previous term's students' union elections.<ref>Patrick Foster, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article737217.ece    21st-century students vote to keep Oxford tradition],       ''[[The Times]]'', 4 March 2006.</ref> This was widely interpreted by students as not so much being a vote on making subfusc voluntary, but rather a vote on whether or not to effectively abolish it by default, as it was assumed that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow.<ref>See, for instance, [http://web.archive.org/web/20061001000000*/http://oxfordstudent.com/ht2006wk1/News/end_of_an_era:_subfusc_could_be_sent_down this article in the student press].</ref>  In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to [[transgender]] people.<ref>[http://www.govtoday.co.uk/education/40-higher-education/12099-support-for-transgender-students-taking-oxford-university-exams Support for transgender students taking Oxford University exams ] retrieved 29 July 2012</ref>

Other traditions and customs vary by college. For example some colleges hold [[formal hall]] six times a week, but for others happens on an irregular basis. At most colleges such meals require gowns to be worn and a Latin grace is said.

''Balls'' are major events held by colleges, The largest, held trienally in 9th week of Trinity term, are called [[Commemoration ball]]s and the dress code is usually [[white tie]]. Many other colleges hold smaller events during that they call summer balls or parties. These are usually held on an annual or irregular basis, and are usually [[black tie]].

[[Punt (boat)|Punting]] is a common summer leisure activity.

===Clubs and societies===
{{See also|Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Oxford}}
[[File:Eights 2005.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Rowing at Summer Eights, an annual intercollegiate [[bumps race]]]]
Sport is played between collegiate teams, in tournaments known as [[cuppers]] (the term is also used for some non-sporting competitions). In addition to these there are higher standard [[:Category:Oxford student sports clubs|university wide groups]]. Significant focus is given to annual [[Varsity match|varsity]] matches played against Cambridge, the most famous of which is [[The Boat Race]], watched by a TV audience of between five and ten million viewers. This outside interest reflects the importance of rowing to many of those within the university. Much attention is given to the termly intercollegiate rowing regattas: Christ Church Regatta, [[Torpids]] and [[Summer Eights]]. A [[Blue (university sport)|blue]] is an award given to those who compete at the University team level in certain sports. As well as traditional sports, there are teams for activities such as [[Octopush]] and [[Muggle Quidditch|Quidditch]].

There are two weekly student newspapers: the independent ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]'' and OUSU's ''[[The Oxford Student]]''. Other publications include the [[Isis magazine|''Isis'' magazine]], ''[[The Owl Journal]]'', the satirical ''[[The Oxymoron|Oxymoron]]'', and the graduate ''[[The Oxonian Review of Books|Oxonian Review]]''. The [[Campus radio|student radio]] station is [[Oxide Radio]]. Most colleges have chapel choirs. Music, drama, and other arts societies exist both at collegiate level and as university-wide groups. Unlike most other collegiate societies, musical ensembles actively encourage players from other colleges.

[[Image:UnionBuildingsDebateChamber.jpg|thumb|The [[Oxford Union]]'s debating chamber.]]
Most academic areas have student societies of some form which are open to all students, regardless of course, for example the [[Oxford University Scientific Society|Scientific Society]]. There are groups for almost all faiths, political parties, countries and cultures.

The [[Oxford Union]] (not to be confused with the Oxford University Student Union) hosts weekly debates and high profile speakers. There have historically been elite invite-only societies such as the [[Bullingdon Club]].

Sports teams, but also other societies and groups constructed especially for the purpose, often take part in ''crewdate''s. These evenings involve 'crews' (often one of each gender, hence the name) going for an meal and consuming much alcohol, before heading to a nightclub.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Beardswoth |first1=Tom |year=2012 |title=Crude dating |journal=Keep Off The Grass |page=9 |publisher=Oxford Student Publications Ltd  |url=http://issuu.com/keepoffthegrass/docs/0_front_cover |accessdate=23 December 2012}}</ref>

===OUSU and Common Rooms===

The [[Oxford University Student Union]], better known by its acronym OUSU, exists to represent students in the University's decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students. The OUSU Executive Committee includes six full-time salaried sabbatical officers, who generally serve in the year following completion of their Final Examinations.

Due to the importance of collegiate life, for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (It is worth noting that JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example Wadham College's entire student population is represented by a combined "Students' Union" and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.

==Notable alumni and academics==
{{Main|List of University of Oxford people}}

{{Main|University of Oxford in popular culture}}
Oxford University is the setting for numerous works of fiction. Oxford was mentioned in fiction as early as 1400 when [[Chaucer]] in his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' referred to a "Clerk [student] of Oxenford". As of 1989, 533 Oxford-based novels had been identified, and the number continues to rise.<ref>Oxford in Fiction: an annotated bibliography, Judy G. Batson</ref> Famous literary works range from ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'' by [[Evelyn Waugh]], to the trilogy ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' by [[Philip Pullman]], which features an alternate-reality version of the University.
