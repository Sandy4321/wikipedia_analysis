'''Paul Kogerman''' (5 December 1891 in [[Tallinn]] &ndash; 27 July 1951 [[Tallinn]]) was an [[Estonia]]n [[chemist]] and founder of modern research in [[oil shale]].

Paul Kogerman was born into a sailor's family. In 1913, he was graduated from the Alexander Gymnasium in Tallinn. Starting in 1913, he studied at the [[University of Tartu]], graduating from its Department of Chemistry in 1918. In 1919&ndash;1920 he got a state scholarship to study at the [[Imperial College London]].<ref name=chemistry>

==Career==
From 1921 to 1936, Kogerman was active at the University of Tartu. After the defence of his Master's thesis on the thermal decay of oil-shale, he was elected docent of Organic Chemistry of the University in 1922.  He went on to become extraordinary professor in 1924 and full professor in 1925.<ref name=chemistry/> In 1926 and 1933 he was guest lecturer at the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Z<U+00FC>rich]] and in 1927&ndash;1928 at [[Harvard University]]. In 1934, he defended, in [[Z<U+00FC>rich]], his doctoral thesis on the combining
and [[Polymerization|polymerization reactions]] of the isolated [[Covalent bond|double bond]] [[diene]]s.<ref name=chemistry/>

From 1936 to 1941, Kogerman was professor of organic chemistry at the [[Tallinn University of Technology|Tallinn Technical Institute/Tallinn Technical University]], in 1936&ndash;1939 he was also a rector of the University.  In 1938, Kogerman was selected to the newly established [[Estonian Academy of Sciences]] and in 1946 reselected after reestablishment of the Academy as the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1938&ndash;1939 Kogerman was ''ex officio'' member of the National Council. From October 1939 until the Soviet occupation of Estonia on 21 June 1940 Kogerman served as Minister of Public Education.

In 1941, Kogerman, together with his family, was deported by Soviet authorities to the prisoner camp in [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]].<ref name=whitebook>
