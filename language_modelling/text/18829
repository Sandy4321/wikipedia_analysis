==History==

In 1841, a tower mill was built on this site by [[millwright]] R Vlieghuis of [[Borger (Drenthe)|Borger]]. The mill was later fitted with Patent sails, the leading edges of which were streamlined using the Van Bussel system. The mill was demolished in 1963.<ref name=History>{{cite web|url=http://www.molens.nl/dbase/molen.php?&molenid=326 |title=Geschiedenis |publisher=De Hollandsche Molen |language=Dutch |accessdate=30 August 2009}} Click on "Geschiedenis" to view.</ref> The brake wheel was used in the restoration of [[De Bonte Hen, Zaandam|De Bonte Hen]], [[Zaandam]].<ref name=Data/>

In 1968, it was decided to rebuild the mill. The tower was built by G J Warmink of Gasselternijveen, incorporating material from the mill demolished in 1963. Millwrighting work was by Medendorp of [[Zuidlaren]].<ref name=History/> The brake wheel and wallower came from a demolished drainage mill ''De Breeken'', which had stood in [[Westerwijtwerd]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]. New sails were fitted in 2009.<ref name=Data>{{cite web|url=http://www.molendatabase.nl/nederland/molen.php?nummer=11 |title=Gasselternijveen, Drenthe |publisher=Molendatabase |language=Dutch |accessdate=30 August 2009}}</ref>

==Description==
{{For|an explanation of the various items of machinery|Mill machinery}}
''De Juffer'' is what the Dutch describe as a "ronde stenen stellingmolen". It is a five storey brick tower mill with a staqe. The stage is at third floor level, it is {{convert|6.20|m|ftin}} above ground level. The four Common sails, which have a span of {{convert|19.20|m|ftin}}, are carried in a cast iron ''windshaft''. This was made by Fabrikaat De Muinck Keizer, of [[Martenshoek]], Groningen in 1899. The ''windshaft'' also carries the ''brake wheel'' which has 57 cogs. The ''brake wheel'' drives the ''wallower'' (32 cogs) at the top of the ''upright shaft''. At the bottom of the ''upright shaft'', the ''great spur wheel'' (72 cogs) drives the lantern pinion ''stone nut'', which has 19 staves. This drives the {{convert|1.10|m|ftin}} diameter French Burr millstones.<ref name=Tech/>
