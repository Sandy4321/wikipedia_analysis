'''Siv Jensen''' (born 1 June 1969) is a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] [[conservative liberalism|conservative-liberal]] politician, and the current leader of the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]]. She was the Progress Party's candidate for [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime Minister]] in the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2009|2009 parliamentary election]].

==Early and personal life==
Jensen was born in [[Oslo]] to [[self-employment|self-employed]] Tore Jensen (1926<U+2013>1989), and Monica Kjelsberg (born 1939),<ref name=stort>{{cite web|url=http://www.stortinget.no/no/Representanter-og-komiteer/Representantene/Representantfordeling/Representant/?perid=SIVJ|title=Jensen, Siv (1969-)|work=Stortinget.no|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> owners of a shoe store during her childhood.

Jensen is educated from the [[Norwegian School of Economics]]. In September 2006, a biography on Siv Jensen was released, written by [[Martine Aurdal]], chief editor of the feminist magazine ''[[Fett (magazine)|Fett]]'', later chief editor of the [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] news magazine ''[[Ny Tid]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.klassekampen.no/39923/article/item/null|title=Avviser drahjelp til Frp|work=[[Klassekampen]]|date=4 October 2006|first=Christiane Jordheim|last=Larsen|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

==Political career==
Her political interest was according to herself sparked at her school, ''Marienlyst skole'', where discussions were common in class. These discussions would include two students who were members of the [[Socialist Youth (Norway)|Socialist Youth]], one being her socialist-turned best friend.<ref name=snl/> Jensen however soon found herself strongly opposed to their views.<ref name=p4port/> She joined the Progress Party around 1988,<ref name=snl/> having partly been introduced to the party through her mother,<ref name=hh/> though she had found her own views to closely fit those of the party herself.<ref name=p4port/> Sometime before this, she had also shortly been a member of the [[Norwegian Young Conservatives|Young Conservatives]], but left after a mere week after attending a meeting where she didn't feel comfortable.<ref name=snl/><ref name=p4port/> 

She was elected deputy [[Member of Parliament]] for Oslo in the period 1993-1997, and has since 1997 been a regular Member of Parliament.<ref name=stort/> During the early 1990s conflict within the party started by many younger libertarians, Jensen stood firmly by party chairman [[Carl I. Hagen]].<ref name=snl/> In 2001 she said Hagen had been like a father figure for her, and she expressed a great admiration of him.<ref name=db011201/> She became first deputy chairman of the Progress Party in 1998, and parliamentary leader of the party in 2005. In 2006, Carl I. Hagen, the prominent chairman of the party since 1978 resigned to become vice president of parliament, and Jensen assumed leadership of the Progress Party temporarily for two years, until finally being elected as regular chairman at the national convention of the party in 2008. While many had been speculating about the viability of the party and its future after a resignation of Carl I. Hagen, a 2004 survey actually showed that Jensen had a better approval rating than Hagen, which was explained by her not being as controversial.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/politikkSamfunn/article399445.ece|title=Siv Jensen danker ut Hagen|work=[[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]]|date=21 December 2004|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Many had also predicted a more [[moderate]] course for the party with her being the leader, but she has however stood firmly by the policies of the party.<ref name=snl/>

Since becoming chairman of the party in 2006, the Progress Party even became the largest party in Norway in many opinion polls, led November 2006 opinion polls with a support of 32.9% of respondents, and continued to poll above 25 percent during the following years.<ref name="Gallup">{{cite news|url=http://www.tns-gallup.no/default.aspx?did=9078387|title=FrP og H<U+00F8>yre g<U+00E5>r kraftig fram|work=TNS Gallup|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref name="VG">{{cite news|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/norsk-politikk/artikkel.php?artid=195848|title=Fosser frem p<U+00E5> diesel-oppr<U+00F8>r: Siv n<U+00E6>r statsministerstolen|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=31 May 2008|first1=Lars Halvor|last1=Mager<U+00F8>y|first2=Bj<U+00F8>rn|last2=Haugan|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref name="VG2">{{cite news|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/norsk-politikk/artikkel.php?artid=528033|title=Frp st<U+00F8>rst p<U+00E5> ny m<U+00E5>ling|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=4 June 2008|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref name="VGmeningsm<U+00E5>ling">{{cite news|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/norsk-politikk/artikkel.php?artid=501050|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|title=Frp over 30 prosent p<U+00E5> ny m<U+00E5>ling|date=26 June 2008|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> With the recent popular support, Jensen has managed to increase the party's appeal to voters and has built bridges to liberal-conservative parties, such as the [[Conservative Party of Norway|Conservative Party]], the party likely to join the Progress Party in an eventual government.

In May 2009, Jensen held a lecture in the British [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] at the invitation of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] MP [[Malcolm Rifkind|Sir Malcolm Rifkind]]. Media director [[Alex Try]] of the [[think tank]] [[Henry Jackson Society]], who was responsible for the arrangement, said that the main background for the invitation was her "engagement in questions about terrorism and challenges attached to the multicultural society." Up to one-hundred MP's, business leaders and key persons in British politics was expected to show up at the arrangement. Jensen said that "we have much to learn from the British, but when it comes to the immigration policy I think Britain has failed completely".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.frp.no/Siv+Jensen+holder+foredrag+for+ledere+i+britisk+politikk+og+n%C3%A6ringsliv.d25-TgZbK3j.ips|title=Siv Jensen holder foredrag for ledere i britisk politikk og n<U+00E6>ringsliv|work=[[Progress Party (Norway)|Frp.no]]|date=8 May 2009|first=Camilla|last=Mollatt|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

In 2011, [[Aftenposten]] wrote that the Progress Party during Jensen's leadership, experienced their "two best national elections".<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=2011-11-17|quote=I den virkelige verden har Frp under Siv Jensen gjort sine beste valg gjennom historien.}}</ref>

==Bilderberg meeting==
In 2006 she attended the annual Bilderberg conference.

==Political views==
[[File:Valg 2009 029.jpg|thumb|Siv Jensen speaking at a rally in Oslo in the 2009 electoral campaign.]]

===Economy===
A big political role model for Jensen is former [[United Kingdom|UK]] Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], and she has in Britain been called a "Norwegian Margaret Thatcher".<ref name=standp/> She therefore holds many [[Thatcherism|Thatcherite]] policies, such as "[[there is no alternative]] to [[market economy]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/05/07/nyheter/inneriks/politikk/regjeringen/siv_jensen/6110686/|title=Norges nye jernlady|first=Gunnar|last=Thorenfeldt|date=7 May 2009|work=[[Dagbladet]]|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

===Populism===
During a [[May Day]] speech in [[Drammen]] in 2009, Jensen stated, after a traditional recurring claim by political opponents that she and the Progress Party is [[populism|populist]], that "if populism is to try to solve the everyday problems of people, then I'm proud to lead a populist party".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/politikk/article3253315.ece|title=Hedersordet som ble skjellsord|date=6 September 2009|work=[[Aftenposten]]|first=Halvor|last=Hegtun|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

===Islam and immigration===
In February 2009, Jensen held a speech where she warned about what she called ''sneaking Islamisation'' (''snikislamisering'') of Norway.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/02/21/nyheter/politikk/innenriks/frp/siv_jensen/4966977/|title=Siv Jensen advarer mot snikislamisering|work=[[Dagbladet]]|date=21 February 2009|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> The speech turned out to be highly controversial among the other mainstream parties.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/norsk-politikk/artikkel.php?artid=547178|title=Vil stenge Siv ute fra innvandringsdebatten|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=23 February 2009|first=Kathrine|last=Hammerstad|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/1.6493505|title=- Sivs beskrivelse er langt fra sann|work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=23 February 2009|first1=Bj<U+00F8>rn|last1=Myklebust|first2=Kristine Grue|last2=Langset|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> She used the immigrant-heavy [[Malm<U+00F6>]], [[Sweden]] city district of [[Roseng<U+00E5>rd]] to illustrate failed integration policies. She also claimed that [[Sharia law]] had replaced Swedish law and that emergency staff were afraid of driving into certain areas. While [[Mattias Gardell]] ridiculed the claims,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abcnyheter.no/node/84139|title=Siv Jensen oppr<U+00F8>rt over Hitler-sammenligning|work=ABC Nyheter|date=23 February 2009|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> the debate itself was welcomed by Norwegian Liberal Party MP [[Abid Raja]] and left-wing newspaper ''[[Klassekampen]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abcnyheter.no/node/84171|title=- Siv Jensen overdriver|work=ABC Nyheter|date=23 February 2009|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> The statements were highly controversial in Sweden, and the Progress Party accepted an invitation to a tour around Roseng<U+00E5>rd by the mayor and police chief of Malm<U+00F6>.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=547220|title=Politisjefen i Roseng<U+00E5>rd "arresterer" Siv Jensen - Svensk lov gjelder i Roseng<U+00E5>rd|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=23 February 2009|first=Bj<U+00F8>rnar|last=Tommelstad|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dagsavisen.no/innenriks/article400282.ece|title=<U+00D8>nsker Frp velkommen til Roseng<U+00E5>rd|work=[[Dagsavisen]]|date=24 February 2009|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Jensen did not join the tour herself, which was instead attended by party colleagues [[Per Sandberg]], [[Per-Willy Amundsen]], [[Solveig Horne]] and [[Mazyar Keshvari]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nettavisen.no/innenriks/politikk/article2569815.ece|title=Jensen st<U+00E5>r over Sverige-tur|work=[[Nettavisen]]|date=9 March 2009|first1=Trond|last1=Lepper<U+00F8>d|first2=Heidi Schei|last2=Lille<U+00E5>s|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

Further, in March 2009, she stated that the fight against radical Islam "is the most important fight of our time." She said that she, as a classical liberal, would always fight against such ideas and movements as [[communism]] and [[nazism]], and that radical Islam "is a dark and scary ideology." She also accused the other parties of being cowardly, ignoring the questions raised by the Progress Party, and claimed that "it is probably an expression of the fact that they don't understand what's happening in society around them. They close their eyes and try to present themselves as tolerant and liberal, when in fact they are deeply intolerant."<ref name=dag23>{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/03/02/nyheter/innenriks/politikk/siv_jensen/islam/5100011/|title=- Kampen mot radikal islam er v<U+00E5>r tids viktigste|work=[[Dagbladet]]|first=Arnhild Aass|last=Kristiansen|date=2 March 2009|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Both these controversies resulted in large popular gains for the Progress Party in polls.<ref name=dag23/>

In response to an incident in early February 2010, where thousands of Muslims demonstrated in Oslo, she changed her claim of a "sneak-Islamisation" of Norway, to instead claim that the debate now was about a full-blown [[Islamisation]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article3515805.ece|work=[[Aftenposten]]|title=Frykter <U+00E5>pen islamisering|date=13 February 2010|first=Gunnar|last=Magnus|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/nett-tv/nyheter/spill/verdi/123458/|title=Siv Jensens tordentale|work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}} (Video clip)</ref> During the demonstration (a response to newspaper ''[[Dagbladet]]'' publishing a [[Muhammad]] cartoon in the context of a news story) activist [[Mohyeldeen Mohammad]] had notably "warned" of a [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] or [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7/7]] in Norway to applause from the crowd.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2010/02/12/nyheter/karikatur/utenriks/politikk/innenriks/10369255/|title=Advarte mot 11. september i Norge|work=[[Dagbladet]]|date=12 February 2010|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

===Israel===
Jensen is a staunch supporter of [[Israel]], and claims to "not [be] afraid to defend Israel's right to defend itself." She visited the Israeli city of [[Sderot]] in the summer of 2008, and experienced [[Hamas]] bombing first hand, and said that she and others had to "run for the air-raid shelter". She strongly opposed the Norwegian government's decision to recognise Hamas as she holds that "you don't negotiate with terrorists, you just don't."<ref name=standp>{{cite news|url=http://www.standpointmag.co.uk/node/692/full|title=A Norwegian Thatcher?|work=[[Standpoint (magazine)|Standpoint]]|date=December 2008|authorlink=Bruce Bawer|first=Bruce|last=Bawer|accessdate=21 December 2010}}</ref> 

In January 2009, in light of the [[Gaza War]], she also held an appeal at a demonstration called "Let Israel live" in support of Israel in Oslo. The Progress Party's general Israel-policy, supported by the appearance at the demonstration by Jensen and the fact that [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democratic Party]] leader [[Dagfinn H<U+00F8>ybr<U+00E5>ten]] had not joined the demonstration, resulted in many Christian Democratic voters fleeing to the Progress Party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tv2nyhetene.no/innenriks/politikk/valg09/-israels-krigfoering-var-ogsaa-terror-2884507.html|title=- Israels krigf<U+00F8>ring var ogs<U+00E5> terror|work=[[TV 2 (Norway)|TV 2]]|date=1 September 2009|first=Eivind|last=Fondenes|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Soon after, the [[Norwegian Police Security Service]] went public, fearing that Jensen might be the target of an attack by "some". Jensen herself did however not fear any trouble.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/norsk-politikk/artikkel.php?artid=539656|title=Politiet frykter angrep p<U+00E5> Siv Jensen |work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=8 January 2009|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> While political scientists had speculated that the Progress Party would lose more voters than they would gain by this strong support for Israel,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/01/08/nyheter/innenriks/politikk/valg/frp/4289846/|title=- Frps Israel-st<U+00F8>tte gir velgertap|work=[[Dagbladet]]|date=8 January 2009|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nettavisen.no/innenriks/article2496700.ece|title=- Siv spiller h<U+00F8>yt|work=[[Nettavisen]]|date=9 January 2009|first=Heidi Schei|last=Lille<U+00E5>s|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> polls rather seemed to show a slight increase in support for the party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nettavisen.no/innenriks/politikk/article2502767.ece|title=Dette kan Siv ha tjent p<U+00E5> |work=[[Nettavisen]]|date=13 January 2009|first=Lars Joakim|last=Skarv<U+00F8>y|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

===Global warming===
About [[global warming]], Jensen said in December 2008 that "we can see that climate changes are happening, but they have been happening for as long as the world has existed. The question is whether they are man-made or not, or whether they are dangerous or not. Just some 30 years ago, all these scientists said that the world was getting colder, and now they have changed their mind and say that the world is getting warmer. So is that what's happening, or isn't it?" Regardless, she is largely supportive of expanding and researching into renewable energy production.<ref name=standp/> In January 2010 she attacked the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]], accusing the report from the panel of being based on fraudulent data. She referred to the erroneous statement of [[Himalaya]]n [[glacier]]s melting by 2035, ice melting predictions by [[Al Gore]] and [[Jonas Gahr St<U+00F8>re]], questions of [[Sampling (statistics)|statistical sampling]], and emails from climate scientists at the [[Climatic Research Unit email incident|Climatic Research Unit]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/politikk/article3493769.ece|work=[[Aftenposten]]|title=- Ikke mer snakk om global oppvarming|first=Gunnar Magnus Paul|last=Audestad|date=31 January 2010|accessdate=21 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref>
