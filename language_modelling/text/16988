''For other roads with the same name see [[A21]].''

The '''A21''' is a major [[trunk road]] in [[Southern England]], and is one of the many, connecting [[London]], and various commuter towns to the south coast. It provides a link to [[Hastings]], [[East Sussex]] and parts of [[Kent]]. Half of the distance covered is over difficult terrain, and the hills and bends on the road result in slow-moving traffic, particularly during weekdays over the more rural stretches; and during the summer with holiday traffic. Once clear of London, the [[Bypass (road)|by-passes]] which exist along the road mean that there are few major settlements directly on the route.
The road is frequently congested due to roundabouts and stretches of single carriageway. 
People have described the A21 as "A Joke" and Business people were reported to <U+201C>hate coming down
the A21<U+201D> <ref>[http://www.hastings.gov.uk/access_hastings/a2hfinalreport_appx.pdf Access to Hastings - Consultation Report - Multi-Modal Study - September 2000]</ref>.
The Highways Agency has plans to dual more of the A21.
Parts of the A21 follow the [[Toll road|turnpike road]]s: one being the section from [[Sevenoaks]] to [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]], opened in 1710;<ref>[http://www.chiddingly.gov.uk/History/The%20Bow%20Bells%20Milestones.html Note on turnpike: Sussex Industrial Archaeological Study Group]</ref> other sections of the road were similarly dealt with later in the century.
The road between the [[M25 motorway|M25]] and Hastings is designated a [[trunk road]], and is maintained and managed by the [[Highways Agency]].

The A21 is used for the {{mi to km|55}} [[Maydayrun]] to [[Hastings]] in which motor cyclers race from South [[London]] to the Hastings seafront. It claims to be the largest non-organised event in the UK,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7383169.stm |title=BBC NEWS &#124; England &#124; Police seek safe May Day bike run |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=4 May 2008<!-- 17:47 UK -->|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref> attracting over 20,000 bikers.

==Overall view of the road==

[[Image:A21highway.jpg|200px|thumb|left|A21 approaching a queue, on the two-span bridge crossing the [[Medway Valley|Valley]] of the [[River Medway]] near Haysden.]]


The A21 begins in [[London Borough of Lewisham|Lewisham]], almost {{mi to km|4}} southeast of the centre of London. Passing through [[Catford]], [[Bromley]] and [[Farnborough, London|Farnborough]], twenty miles (32km) from the start of the journey,  it reaches the Kent border and the open countryside. Shortly afterwards the first of the [[bypass]]es is reached, that avoiding [[Sevenoaks]], [[Tonbridge]] and [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]]. The second bypass takes the road around [[Lamberhurst]], avoiding a river valley, after which the terrain becomes more difficult for the remainder of the journey. The steep hills and long bends typical of the region contribute to the slow-moving traffic at busy periods.
The most recent bypass is the two mile Lamberhurst bypass and a short dual carriageway immediately before the crossroads at Flimwell gives little redress, for the 2nd lane in both directions has been permanently coned off, although may re-open if it is extended. Near the end of this dual cariageway the road enters East Sussex. Another bypass takes the road around the narrow road through [[Salehurst]]  and [[Robertsbridge]]. Immediately before Hastings outskirts is the final hill, almost four miles (6.4km) in length.

==The route in detail==
===London===
The A21 starts in [[Lewisham]] in [[London]] at a roundabout on the [[A20 road|A20]] known as "Loampit Vale Junction". From there the road uses various roads in [[Catford]], where the [[A205 road|A205]] (the South Circular Road) crosses the A21; it runs south east up ''Bromley Hill'' to enter the [[London Borough of Bromley]], where there are sections of dual carriageway, on the town<U+2018>s [[Roundabout|gyratory system]] (part of which is called ''Kentish Way'') .

Up ''Masons Hill'' the road reaches [[Bromley Common]], the first large-scale open space negotiated; briefly, just before Farnborough, the road becomes ''Hastings Road''. The original A21 went though the suburb, the High Street is now the B2158. Until now the road has been in a south-easterly direction, but after [[Green Street Green]] it turns eastwards towards the valley of the [[River Darent]], and it is at this point that the road pattern makes a complete change from its original route.  

The A21 originally entered Kent here and climbed to the scarp of the [[North Downs]] at Polhill, and then descended through [[Dunton Green]] and up the valley of the [[River Darent]] to [[Sevenoaks]]; through the town centre and then down into the [[River Medway|Medway valley]]  via [[Hildenborough]] to Tonbridge.  The ''London Road'' at the north of the town is now the B245; it continued through the long High Street, over the many bridges of the river (during which time it was also part of the [[A26 road|A26]] from [[Maidstone]] ). As the road began to climb out of the valley it took a left fork; shortly after this the route of the modern A21 is rejoined.

===Badgers Mt. to Pembury===
[[Image:LamerhurstA21.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A21 [[Lamberhurst]] Bypass, Completed in 2005]]
[[Image:A21 Oakhhurst.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A21 at [[Oakhurst, Kent|Oakhurst]], [[Kent]]. ]]
Where the new A21 begins, and also where the [[A224 road|A224]] joins from the north, the road is called the ''Sevenoaks Road'';  at [[Knockholt]] (''Hewitts Roundabout''), the road enters [[Kent]] near its junction with a spur from the [[M25 motorway]]. The A21 actually [[Multiplex (road)|multiplexes]] with the M25 and descends the North Downs Scarp here. The M25 then has to use a slip road in the left lane and the A21 takes priority although is still technically a motorway until the junction with the [[A25 road|A25]] to [[Sevenoaks]] and the [[M26 motorway|M26]]. The oddness of Junction 5 is due to the M26 once being part of the M25.
Before the M25 was built, the A21 was the modern A224 near Polhill and then became the Dual Carriageway Sevenoaks bypass

South of the junction with the A25, the road becomes the Sevenoaks bypass which generally has two lanes in each direction. The Sevenoaks bypass runs down around nearby valleys and at one point includes the widest part of the A21 with three lanes climbing Riverhill northbound from the junction near the village of Sevenoaks Weald. The road is then the Tonbridge Bypass. This section bypasses the original route of the A21 along the B245 through [[Hildenborough]], Tonbridge High Street, and Pembury Road to join the current route near the second A26 junction.
The section has not very many junctions and runs partly through the [[High Weald]] [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].
Between [[Leigh, Kent|Leigh]] and [[Haysden, Kent|Haysden]] the road crosses the [[Medway Valley]] by the means of a two-span lengthy viaduct which crosses the [[River Medway]] and passes Haysden Water.

The A21 then curves round the area until eventually reaching two junctions with the [[A26 road|A26]] through Tonbridge and [[Tunbridge Wells]].

South of here the A21 remains dualled until becoming a {{mi to km|1.7}} single-carriageway between ''Castle Hill'' and [[Pembury]], which has had a long history of delays, causing a major bottleneck which is still not resolved as of 2008. <ref>[http://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2005-03-01a.239.0&s=speaker%3A10404 Parliamentary speech 2005]</ref>

===Pembury to Lamberhurst===
The dual carriageway resumes after the Castle Hill bottleneck at the  first roundabout since leaving the M25; this section was built to bypass [[Pembury]]. The dual carriageway has more bends than before and has less bridges. The road comes to a grade separated junction with the [[A264 road]] to [[Tunbridge Wells]] and the [[A228 road|A228]] to [[Maidstone]]. There is also a local turning later on into Pembury. From here the road is generally more straight than normal and travels uphill and then level. Later on the dual carriageway ends at a roundabout. 
The next section of A21 is another major bottleneck, being a single carriageway with frequent bends however in October 2005 the "Preferred Route" to deal with this {{mi to km|3}} section was announced.<ref>[http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/5701.aspx Kippings Cross to Lamberhurst road improvements].</ref> 

===Lamberhurst to John's Cross===
[[Image:A21 road.jpg|thumb|200px|A21 near [[Hildenborough]].]]
However, some work has been completed. One of these, the 2 mile <U+00A3>18 million [[Lamberhurst]] bypass, was opened on 23 March 2005. Here the road had steep inclines into the village and the valley of the [[River Bewl]].  Included in the scheme is a [[land bridge]] at [[Scotney Castle]].<ref>[http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/a_roads/a21/lamberhurst_bypass/ Lamberhurst Bypass Information]</ref>  The scheme was also constructed by [[May Gurney]] and 50,000 trees are planted on the new road.<ref>[http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/documents/49_bypass_opening05.pdf Bypass Opening - Highways Agency]</ref>  On the current bypass the A21 skirts to the east on a road through farms until eventually it gets to Scotney Castle where the dual carriageway ends at a roundabout.

The next section of road is a single-carriageway which travels past [[Bewl Water]] until it becomes the {{mi to km|1.2}} ''[[Flimwell]] bypass''. This has recently been reduced to one lane in each direction to reduce speeding.
As the Dual Carriageway ends, the road enters [[East Sussex]].
The road afterwards near [[Salehurst]], where the  1992 [[Robertsbridge]] bypass begins, taking traffic away from the narrow main street in the village.
Unlike the bypasses north of here, this is built to a Single-Carriageway standard.

===Mountfield to Hastings===
At Johns Cross the original A21 followed the present day [[A2100 road]] through [[Mountfield]], [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]] and across the north of Hastings around [[Hollington]] and ended at the Baldslow Interchange where the [[A28 road|A28]] made for the town centre.  The present route uses the original B2091, [[A229 road|A229]] and [[A28 road|A28]] which takes the present route to the east on a relatively straight, though undulating, journey, bypassing [[Sedlescombe]] before climbing a four-mile (6.4km) long hill to enter [[Hastings]] where the first junction reached is the Baldslow Interchange where currently the A28, A2100 and B2093 roads all terminate.  The A21 then heads through on a wide single-carriageway bypass of Baldslow (''Sedlescombe road north'') along with access to sub-urban streets until eventually the A2101 heads for the Town Centre.  The A21 then enters [[Silverhill, Hastings|Silverhill]] where it gets to a junction which is sometimes a major bottleneck. Afterwards the A2102 heads for St Leonards and the A21 becomes the high street for Bohemia where the road is quite narrow and there are often roadworks.  The route then heads down with access to various emergency services and then enters the town centre.  From here the original A21 cut through the town centre to meet the [[A259 road|A259]] at a roundabout near Pelham Crescent however since the town centre has been [[pedestrianised]] the A21 heads down on the sub-urban streets to the east.  The remainder of the A21 heads around partly on a one-way system near the [[Hastings railway station|railway station]] and the new Priory Quarter business development and then meets the A2101 road again which continues through the town centre to the A259.

==Proposed Improvements==
{{Future road}}
Large portions of the A21, through Kent mostly, are dual carriageway with intervening stretches of single carriageway.
The current plans are to dual the rest of the road through Kent to alleviate congestion, safety and accessibility problems in the villages along the route.<ref>[http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4018.aspx A21 South Pembury to Hastings Route Improvements - Highways Agency]</ref>  There are also proposals to dual all of the remaining stretches of [[Single carriageway]] which may cause the lane on the short dualled section through the Kent/East Sussex border to reopen. 

In 2002 , it was reported that a 22 kilometers (14 mi) section of the A21 south of [[Flimwell]] was the most dangerous road in the [[South East England|south east]] outside [[London]], and the 38th most dangerous in the country,<ref>[http://www.hastingsobserver.co.uk/newshastings/ROADS-NAMED-AND-SHAMED-IN.258259.jp ROADS NAMED AND SHAMED IN REPORT - Hastings Today - Back to Home Page], 19 February 2002.

The Highways Agency has proposed dualling of the short single carriageway around
Castle Hill which is one of the most congested sections of the road.
This section will be a two-lane dual carriageway with, possibly, a third lane up the hill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/4003.aspx |title=Highways Agency - A21 Tonbridge to Pembury Dualling |publisher=Highways.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7293666.stm BBC article on improvements]</ref>
There will also be a [[Flyover]]/Improvement at Longfield road roundabout, giving access to a proposed new regional hospital at [[Pembury]],<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4317470.stm Funding recommended for A21 plans 				BBC news]</ref> as well as another unclassified road being Grade Separated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/documents/A21_Tonbridge_to_Pembury_AST.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - A21 Tonbridge to Pembury AST Version 05.2 ISSUE VERSION _24 August 07_.doc |date= |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref>  The Bypass will cost <U+00A3>64 million.<ref>[http://www.southeast-ra.gov.uk/documents/factsheet/39.pdf A21 Tonbridge Bypass to Pembury Dualling] - Factsheet 39 (PDF)</ref>

===Kippings Cross to Forstal Farm===
When the Pembury bypass ends at ''Kippings Cross'', the next section of A21  is a low quality single carriageway road with several steep gradients across the [[Weald]]. There are few major centres of habitation on the road
and limited or no footpaths.
There are many houses next to the route an the road has very frequent bends.
The Kippings Cross to Lamberhurst section has a high accident rate and congestion occurs particularly at peak times. <ref>[http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/5701.aspx Kippings Cross to Lamberhurst - Highways Agency]</ref>

It is proposed that this section should be turned into a two-lane dual carriageway  with footpaths
and is proposed to be completely off-line, although mainly following the existing route, and have
improvements to the [[A262 road|A262]] roundabout. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/documents/A21_Kippings_Cross_AST.pdf |title=Economy: Economic Efficiency of the Transport System (TEE)<!-- Bot generated title --> |date= |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref>
The Bypass is said to cost <U+00A3>40 million. <ref>[http://www.southeast-ra.gov.uk/documents/factsheet/40.pdf SE fact sheet scheme for Kippings Cross to Lamberhurst scheme]</ref>

===Flimwell to Northbridge street===
Plans have been published for a new road between the southern end of the Flimwell bypass and the beginning of the [[Robertsbridge]] bypass.The 5.5 mile (8.9km) improvement will bypass the villages of Flimwell, Hurst Green and Silver Hill.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4275369.stm Bypasses for A21 villages unveiled - BBC News]</ref>  The improvement will commence at the B2079 junction (Lady Oak Lane) on the short section of existing dual carriageway north of Flimwell and terminate at the roundabout at the northern end of the Robertsbridge Bypass.
Although part of the road will be brought up to a dual carriageway standard, parts will become a 'wide single carriageway'

===Baldsow Interchange===
When the Hastings-Bexhill Link Road is complete, more traffic will use the already congested road from the [[A2100 road|A2100]]/[[A28 road|A28]] to the A21 at Baldslow Interchange, Hastings.
There are plans to build a short link road to the A21 south of the interchange and bring more of the A21, from there up past to a new roundabout in an area north of the interchange, to [[dual carriageway]] standard.
Another option is to realign the A2100 north of the junction, but this option is less favourable due to environmental concerns.<ref>[http://www.uk-roads.co.uk/gallery/albums/userpics/10259/A21BaldslowJunction.pdf Baldslow-Queensway Link Road Options]</ref>
