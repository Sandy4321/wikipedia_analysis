'''St Briavels Castle''' is a [[moat]]ed [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[castle]] at [[St Briavels]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Gloucestershire]]. The castle is noted for its huge [[Edward I of England|Edwardian]] [[gatehouse]] that guards the entrance.

St Briavels Castle was originally built between 1075 and 1129 as a royal administrative centre for the [[Forest of Dean]]. During the 13th century the castle became first a favourite hunting lodge of [[King John I of England|King John]], and then the primary centre in England for the manufacture of [[quarrel]]s, large numbers of which were required for [[crossbow]]s in medieval warfare. The castle was transferred many times between royal favourites in the 14th and 15th centuries and slowly declined in appearance and importance. St Briavels Castle became used primarily as a court and as a notorious debtors' prison, conditions being documented by the prison reformer [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]] in 1775. Following local riots and a parliamentary investigation in the 1830s, [[prison reform|reforms]] in the 19th century brought an end to the castle's use as a prison.

Extensive renovation at the turn of the 20th century allowed St Briavels Castle to be taken over as a [[hostel|Youth Hostel]] in 1948. It remains in this role today, owned by [[English Heritage]] and open to the public. The castle is classed as a Grade I [[listed building]] and as a [[Scheduled Monument]].

==Architecture==

St Briavels Castle is located on a spur dominating a position above the [[River Wye]], on the western edge of the [[Forest of Dean]].<ref name=RemfryP1>Remfry, p. 1.</ref> The castle is predominantly built of local [[Old Red Sandstone|old red sandstone]] and [[limestone]].<ref name=CurnowJohnsonP91>Curnow and Johnson, p. 91.</ref> The castle site is surrounded by an in-filled [[moat]]; now a garden, the moat was originally wet and fed by a spring underneath the moat itself.<ref>Urban, p. 503.</ref>

The castle [[keep]], which collapsed and was demolished in the 18th century, was originally a square Norman design, 15.6 m by 13.9 m (51&nbsp;ft by 45&nbsp;ft) in size, built on a [[motte]] of clay and stone.<ref name=VereyP333>Verey, p. 333; Curnow and Johnson, p. 92.</ref> Intact, it would have been approximately 20&nbsp;m (66&nbsp;ft) tall, and would have resembled the keeps at [[Goodrich Castle]] and [[White Castle (Wales)|White Castle]], both of a similar period and design in the region.<ref>Curnow and Johnson, p. 93.</ref>

The keep was protected by the stone [[curtain wall]] that still survives today, forming the castle [[Ward (fortification)|bailey]].<ref name=CurnowJohnsonP94>Curnow and Johnson, p. 94.</ref> Its irregular polygonal plan suggests that it was built on the site of an earlier [[Earthwork (archaeology)|earthwork]].<ref name=VereyP333/> It originally had a small round tower protecting the south-east corner and probably a [[gate]]way in the south wall alongside the keep.<ref name=CurnowJohnsonP94/> Other demolished buildings included a [[forge]] and assorted buildings along the north-east of the bailey.<ref name="Curnow and Johnson, p. 95"/> A set of medieval domestic buildings still stand along the north-west side of the bailey, however, including a [[hall]], [[Solar (room)|solar]] and [[chapel]], originally providing accommodation for the castle constable and the King.<ref name="Curnow and Johnson, p. 95">Curnow and Johnson, p. 95.</ref> These buildings were restored in the 19th century to their current condition.<ref name="Curnow and Johnson, p. 95"/> Some features, including the hall range, fireplace and capitals appear to date from the 13th century.<ref name=VereyP333/>  The hall and solar form a two-storey building 23 m by 10 m (75&nbsp;ft by 33&nbsp;ft) wide, alongside the 14th century chapel, which still incorporates later 17th century adjustments and windows.<ref>Curnow and Johnson, pp. 96, 98.</ref>  At one end of the domestic range is the famous "Forester's Horn" chimney, crested with the forest warden's horn, a symbol of [[Forest law#Forest law|Forest Law]] and the castle's authority.<ref>Urban, p. 503; Curnow and Johson, p. 97.</ref>  The buildings include a sunken pit prison; [[graffiti]] dated 1671 show that it was still in use for that purpose at that time.<ref>Pettifer, p. 80; Verey, p. 333.</ref>

[[File:St Briavels Castle - geograph.org.uk - 22533.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The Edwardian castle [[gatehouse]].]]
The [[gatehouse]] of St Briavels Castle is described in [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]]'s ''[[Buildings of England]]'' as "magnificent... a very fine example of the royal masons' work of the period."<ref name=VereyP332>Verey, p. 332.</ref> It is a massive structure of two large D-shaped towers flanking a wide gate passage 14.8&nbsp;m (48&nbsp;ft) long, and linked above by a large room.<ref>Curnow and Johnson, p. 99; Verey, p. 332.</ref> This sort of gatehouse is sometimes termed a keep-gatehouse or gatehouse-keep because of the massive size and defences on both the inner and outer sides of the building.<ref>King, p. 119; Curnow and Johnson, p. 99; Verey, p. 332.</ref> The first gatehouse of this sort was built at [[Caerphilly Castle]]; other examples exist in North Wales and at [[Tonbridge Castle]].<ref name=KingP119>King, p. 119.</ref> Uniquely, St Briavels' gatehouse is protected with three sets of [[portcullis]]es{{spaced ndash}}although some gatehouses, such as [[Harlech Castle|Harlech]] and [[Beaumaris Castle]] were built for slots for three, they were only installed with two.<ref name=KingP119/> A notable feature is the existence of smaller portcullises to defend the doorways from the passage to the porters' lodges.<ref name=VereyP332/> The gatehouse was originally taller than it is today and the entrance would also have included a [[drawbridge]], removed during the 20th century.<ref name=CurnowJohnsonP100/>

The base of the gatehouse is defended from [[Mining (military)|undermining]] by large [[Spur (architecture)|"spurs"]]. This design feature is characteristic of castles in the [[Welsh Marches]], including [[Goodrich Castle|Goodrich]] and [[Tonbridge Castle]], but unlike these castles depends on a solid octagonal, rather than square, based interacting with the form of the circular towers.<ref>Curnow and Johnson, p.99; Pettifer, pp. 96<U+2013>7; Thompson, p. 114.</ref> The gatehouse is well defended, except for the upper windows at the rear; the upper floors were designed for high status guests and these windows would have provided adequate light for the chambers.<ref name="CurnowJohsonP99"/> The south-east of the gatehouse is relatively modern, however, having been rebuilt after a past collapse.<ref name=CurnowJohnsonP100>Curnow and Johnson, p. 100.</ref>

==History==
===11th and 12th centuries===
[[File:St Briavel Castle Gatehouse Spur.JPG|thumbnail|right|225px|The octagonal [[Spur (architecture)|"spurs"]] designed to prevent [[Mining (military)|undermining]].]]
St Briavels Castle appears to date from [[Normans|Norman]] times, although the village itself predates the Norman period.<ref name=RemfryP1/> The area was acquired by [[William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford|William FitzOsbern]], the first [[Earl of Hereford]] in 1067, who built a number of castles across the region, including [[Chepstow Castle|Chepstow]], [[Monmouth Castle|Monmouth]], [[Clifford Castle|Clifford]] and [[Wigmore Castle|Wigmore]].<ref name=RemfryP1/> It does not appear that FitzOsbern built a castle on the St Briavels site, however, and the revolt of FitzOsbern's son, [[Roger de Breteuil, 2nd Earl of Hereford|Roger de Breteuil]] resulted in the village being taken into the possession of the royal [[bailiff]]s of the [[Forest of Dean]].<ref name=RemfryP1/>

St Briavels Castle was constructed sometime between 1075 and 1129 by royal mandate, although the precise date is uncertain.<ref name=RemfryP2>Remfry, p. 2.</ref> [[Walter de Gloucester]], the Sheriff of Gloucester and his son [[Miles de Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford|Miles de Gloucester]] made St Briavels Castle the administrative centre of the Forest of Dean.<ref name=RemfryP1/> The location of the castle placed it well behind the English border, in an area with little Welsh presence before the invasion, and it therefore appears to have been established for the purposes of royal governance, rather than to protect the [[Welsh Marches]] to its west.<ref name=CurnowJohnsonP91/> Equivalents elsewhere in the south-west include [[Restormel Castle]] and [[Lydford Castle]] in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], both regional royal administrative centres.<ref name=CurnowJohnsonP92>Curnow and Johnson, p. 92.</ref> One alternative view, however, sees St Briavels as intended to protect the [[Severn estuary]] to the south, along with the royal castles of [[Bristol Castle|Bristol]] and [[Gloucester Castle|Gloucester]].<ref name="Emery, p. 15">Emery, p. 15.</ref> This early castle was of [[motte and bailey]] design, the keep probably of wood.<ref name=CurnowJohnsonP92/>

Miles and his partner [[Pain fitzJohn]] strengthened their hold on the Welsh border during the last years of [[King Henry I of England|Henry I]], but after the king's death in 1135 England descended into the civil war of [[the Anarchy]], as factions loyal to [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] and the [[Empress Matilda]] fought for control of the country.<ref name=RemfryP2/> Fitz John was killed early in the fighting, but Miles declared in favour of Matilda and took control of the castle in his own right.<ref name=RemfryP2/> In 1141 the Empress confirmed Miles as the [[Earl of Hereford]] and formally granted him St Briavels Castle.<ref name=RemfryP2/> Under Miles, the castle escaped the worst of the fighting of the Anarchy. Miles' son, [[Roger Fitzmiles, 2nd Earl of Hereford|Roger Fitzmiles]] continued to hold the castle into the reign of [[King Henry II of England|Henry II]], the empress' son, but a confrontation with the king resulted in it being removed from the earldom and taken back into royal ownership, once again as part of the Forest of Dean.<ref name=RemfryP2/> Henry II rebuilt the castle keep in the 1160s, replacing the older wooden structure with stone.<ref name=CurnowJohnsonP92/>

Royal forests in the early medieval period were subject to special royal jurisdiction; forest law was "harsh and arbitrary, a matter purely for the King's will".<ref name=HuscroftP97>Huscroft, p.97.</ref> Forests were expected to supply the king with hunting grounds, raw materials, goods and money.<ref name=HuscroftP97/> The Forest of Dean could be used for hunting, but was more important to the king as a major metalworking centre, thanks to the plentiful supply of trees for making [[charcoal]] and the iron deposits in the limestone stone of the region.<ref>Curnow and Johnson, p.92; Pounds, p. 200.</ref> The iron goods constructed locally were stored at the castle before being shipped to other royal locations.<ref name=RemfryP2/> The quantities being produced were substantial{{spaced ndash}}in 1172, for example, Henry II received 100&nbsp;[[axe]]s, 1,000&nbsp;[[Pickaxe|picks]], 2,000&nbsp;[[shovel]]s and 60,000&nbsp;[[Nail (fastener)|nails]] from St Briavel Castle.<ref name=RemfryP2/> [[King Richard I of England|Richard I]] took 50,000 [[horseshoe]]s on [[Third Crusade|crusade]] with him from St Briavel.<ref name=RemfryP2/> The constable of St Briavel Castle had wide ranging responsibilities within the Forest, including managing the rights and privileges of the iron-workers, exercised through the Miners' and the [[St Briavels (hundred)|Hundreds Court]] of the castle.<ref>Curnow and Johnson, p. 91; Rudge, p. 22.</ref>

===13th century===

[[File:Rear of St Briavels Castle Gatehouse.JPG|thumbnail|180px|right|The inner face of St Briavels Castle [[gatehouse]].]]
[[King John I of England|King John]] enjoyed regular [[hunting]] in the Forest each November, and used St Briavels Castle as his base for such trips. The king entertained the Welsh lord Gruffyd ap Cadwallon at the castle in 1207.<ref name=RemfryP3>Remfry, p. 3; Curnow and Johnson, p.96.</ref> This royal interest resulted in further building works and substantial expenditure, with <U+00A3>291 being spent in the next four years.<ref name=RemfryP3/> A stone curtain wall replaced an earlier wooden one between 1209<U+2013>11, complete with a tower and gateway.<ref name="CurnowJohnsonP94"/> Inside the bailey a number of buildings suitable for use by the king as a lodge were constructed.<ref name="Curnow and Johnson, p. 95"/> A wooden chapel was built within the castle in 1236<U+2013>7.<ref name="Curnow and Johnson, p. 98">Curnow and Johnson, p. 98.</ref> The castle expansion may have been funded by the increased taxes from iron-working across the areas, and by the end of John's reign, the castle was almost in its mature form.<ref>Nicholls 1858, p. 11; Remfry, p. 3.</ref>

In 1217 the [[Charter of the Forest]] was passed, in part to mitigate the worst excesses of royal jurisdiction.<ref>Huscroft, p. 173.</ref> The forest laws, however, did allow for a very wide range of fines to be imposed on local peasants who broke the numerous edicts in place to protect both wildlife and the trees in the forest.<ref>Birrell, p. 149.</ref> The courts held at St Briavels Castle imposed a relatively large number of fines, or [[amercement]]s, for both illegal wood-cutting and the poaching of venison during the period.<ref>Birrell, p. 154.</ref>  The castle also began to be used a prison shortly afterwards, partially for forest trespassers and for those who could not pay the required fines.<ref>Pugh, p. 79.</ref>

After King John's death, however, St Briavels Castle became the primary centre for English [[quarrel]] manufacture. The [[crossbow]] was an important military advance on the older [[short bow]] and was the favoured weapon by the time of Richard I{{spaced ndash}}many crossbows and even more quarrels were needed to supply royal forces.<ref>Pounds, p. 108.</ref> Crossbows were primarily built at the [[Tower of London]], but St Briavels Castle, with the local forest to provide raw materials, became the national centre for quarrel manufacture.<ref>Pounds, p. 110.</ref>
[[File:St Briavels Castle Gateway Passage.JPG|thumbnail|180px|left|The gatehouse passageway, uniquely defended with three [[portcullis]]es.]]
In 1228 John Malemort, William the Smith and William the Fletcher arrived at the castle and began production operations at a [[forge]] built within the bailey.<ref>Remfry, p. 3; Curnow and Johnson, p. 95.</ref> A production level of 120,000 quarrels in a 120 day period was achieved by 1233, with men like Malemort being able to produce up to 100&nbsp;quarrels a day.<ref>Curnow and Johnson, p. 91; Pounds, p. 109; Remfry, p. 3.</ref> Quarrels were then put into barrels and shipped across the kingdom in large quantities.<ref>Pounds, p. 109.</ref> Other iron from the castle was sent to build [[siege engine]]s in [[Hereford]].<ref name=CurnowJohnsonP92/> The manufacturing capability of St Briavels Castle gave the king a distinct advantage over potential baronial enemies, with the supply of arms from the castle to Marcher Lords threatened by the Welsh being one of the levers of royal power during the period.<ref>Pounds, p. 146.</ref>

Now a centre for arms manufacture, the castle was made more secure, with a new defensive ditch, freshly repaired walls and a new chapel.<ref name=RemfryP3/> The castle was garrisoned with royal troops during the uprising of [[Richard Marshal, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Richard Marshal]] against [[King Henry III of England|Henry III]] in 1233<U+2013>4, suggesting it had considerable military value at this time.<ref>Remfry, p. 4.</ref> Another indicator of the military importance of the castle and the surrounding forest was the <U+00A3>20 fee each year being paid to the constable of the castle by 1287, on a par with the much larger castles of [[Rhuddlan Castle|Rhuddlan]] or [[Nottingham Castle|Nottingham]].<ref>Pounds, p. 88.</ref>

Under Edward I, the massive gatehouse was built to protect the castle entrance, including special protection against undermining.<ref>Pettifer, p. 80.</ref> There has been speculation that the royal architect [[James of Saint George]] may have been responsible for the building work, which occurred between 1292<U+2013>3 at a cost of <U+00A3>477.<ref>Curnow and Johnson, p. 99, 103.</ref> The reason for the king extending the castle at this time is unclear, as the castle was relatively far from the Welsh border and in no particular risk of attack.<ref name=CurnowJohnsonP103>Curnow and Johnson, p. 103.</ref> One popular explanation is that given the quantities of weapons and money being stored at the property by this time, the gatehouse was designed to improve the internal security of the castle; the presence of the additional portcullises would also support this explanation.<ref name=CurnowJohnsonP103/> In 1300, the old wooden chapel was rebuilt in stone and in 1310, an extension to the castle wall was constructed at a cost of <U+00A3>40; called 'the Peel', this followed the line of the old motte and gave additional protection to the keep.<ref>Curnow and Johnson, p. 94, 98.</ref>

===14th<U+2013>17th centuries===

[[File:St Briavels Castle Chapel.JPG|thumbnail|right|225px|St Briavel's Castle [[chapel]], redesigned in the 17th century]]
St Briavels Castle remained an important location in the reign of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], as the [[Welsh Marches]] were a key region in the wars between the king, his favourites and various noble factions during the period.<ref>Weir, p. 129.</ref> [[Roger d'Amory]] was the constable of the castle during the early years of Edward's reign. D'Amory was a royal favourite and Edward II visited the Castle several times, with an extensive renovation of the rooms and quarters occurring during this time.<ref name=CurnowJohsonP99>Curnow and Johnson, p. 99.</ref> Around <U+00A3>500 was spent on the work, a substantial sum.<ref name=CurnowJohsonP99/>

D'Amory was supplanted in the king's favour by [[Hugh Despenser the Younger]], and d'Amory fought against the king in the [[Despenser War]] of 1321-22. After the war, Edward placed the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]] under the control of the Despensers, with [[Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester|Hugh Despenser the Elder]] taking particular responsibility for St Briavels.<ref>MacKenzie, p. 323; Vickers, p. 117.</ref> The Despensers appointed Robert Sapy as the keeper of St Briavels and the other confiscated castles across the Marches.<ref name=FrydeP176>Fryde, p. 176.</ref> Violence began to break out across the region in response to the Despenser's harsh rule, and Sapy's deputy was attacked in July 1325 on his way back from St Briavels Castle to London; his eyes were torn out, his arms and legs broken and all his records and money stolen.<ref name=FrydeP176/> Edward and the Despensers were deposed shortly afterwards by Edward's wife, [[Isabella of France]].<ref>Weir, p. 255.</ref> Isabella set about expanding her own lands after her victory, and took St Briavels Castle and various other royal castles into her own possession.<ref>Weir, p. 257.</ref> When Isabella herself was overthrown by her son, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], in 1330 the castle then reverted back to the crown.

Towards the end of the 14th century, England saw increasing conflict between the rival [[Yorkist]] and [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] factions. St Briavels Castle passed back and forth between the senior nobility on either side, but without playing a major part in the conflict itself. The castle was initially given to King Edward's son [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Thomas, Duke of Gloucester]]; with the fall of Thomas from favour after his uprising against [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], [[Thomas le Despenser, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Thomas le Despenser]] received a life grant of the castle in 1397, as part of his reward for serving Richard.<ref>Dunn, p. 59.</ref> With Thomas' own fall from power under [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], the castle was then given to Henry's son, the [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]].<ref name="MacKenzie, p. 323">MacKenzie, p. 323.</ref> [[Henry de Beauchamp, 1st Duke of Warwick|Henry Beauchamp, the Duke of Warwick]] and a close friend of [[Henry VI of England|Henry IV]], then acquired St Briavels Castle and the Forest of Dean around 1445.<ref>Hicks, p. 31.</ref> [[William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1423<U+2013>1469)|William Herbert]] was rewarded with the castle in 1467 for his support for [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] and the Yorkist faction during the [[Wars of the Roses]]; he was then executed by the Lancastrian [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick]], who took the castle for his own.<ref name=Nicholls1863P14>Nicholls, 1863, p. 14.</ref> Warwick died himself at the [[Battle of Barnet]] in 1471, but after being briefly held by Richard Hyet, [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] restored St Briavels Castle to Neville's widow, [[Anne Neville, 16th Countess of Warwick]].<ref name=Nicholls1863P14/> With Anne's death in 1492, the castle passed into the control of Thomas Baynham.<ref name=Nicholls1863P14/>

[[File:St Briavels Castle Victorian print.JPG|left|thumb|225px|St Briavels Castle in 1823]]
By this time, however, St Briavels Castle had been in a slow period of decline for many years, similar to that of several other royal castles in the region, including Bristol and Gloucester.<ref name="Emery, p. 15"/> Minor improvements were made, including various light windows added to the internal buildings in the 15th century,<ref>Curnow and Johnson, p. 96.</ref> and extensive restyling of the chapel in the 17th century, but not to the extent of those castles successfully converted to more luxurious dwellings.<ref name="Curnow and Johnson, p. 98"/>

Under [[James I of England|James I]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles]] the castle was traditionally granted to the [[Earl of Pembroke|Earls of Pembroke]].<ref name=Nicholls1863P16>Nicholls, 1863, p. 16.</ref> By the time of the [[English Civil War]], St Briavels Castle was held by [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke|Philip Herbert]], the 4th earl and a friend of the king's.<ref name=Nicholls1863P16/> Philip Herbert sided with [[Roundheads|Parliament]], however, and St Briavels' played little part in the conflict.<ref name=Nicholls1863P16/> With the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] and the return of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to power in 1660, the castle was removed from the Earls of Pembroke and given instead to [[Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester|Henry, Lord Herbert of Raglan]] for life. After Henry's death, [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Duke of Beaufort]] was granted the property; after the disgrace of the Duke of Beaufort a few years later, the castle changed hands again, with the subsequent owners being more modest figures in English public life than had been the case in previous years.<ref name="MacKenzie, p. 323"/>

===18th and 19th centuries===

[[File:St Briavels Castle Courtroom.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The [[courtroom]] at St Briavels Castle in early Victorian times.]]
In the 18th century many of the buildings inside the bailey were knocked down and the more valuable materials, including the [[lead]] from the roof, recycled.<ref name="Curnow and Johnson, p. 95"/> The keep partially collapsed in 1752, with the remainder falling down in 1777.<ref>Brayley and Tombleson, "St. Briavel's Castle"; Storer, p. 2; [http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=109524&sort=4&search=all&criteria=st%20briavels%20castle&rational=q&recordsperpage=10#aRt National Monuments Record, accessed 13 August 2010.]</ref> Victorian writers blamed both the progress of time and the theft of stones by local peasants for the collapse.<ref>Thomas, p. 59.</ref> The famous "forester's horn" chimney was moved from its original location to the west side of the building between 1783 and 1824.<ref>Curnow and Johnson, p.97.</ref> Whilst not achieving the [[picturesque]] status of other ruined castes in the area, [[Georgian era|Georgian]] visitors noted the "beautiful and romantic scenery that surrounds these ruins".<ref>Storer, p. 2.</ref>

The castle was now principally a prison and a court, still operating under the authority of the constable and the Forest Law originally established in 1217.<ref>King, p. 5; Curnow and Johnson, p. 95.</ref> The remaining buildings inside the bailey were converted into a courtroom and jury room, with the west side of the gatehouse being used as a jail for detaining prisoners.<ref name="Curnow and Johnson, p. 95"/> St Briavels Castle was primarily a [[debtors' prison]]&nbsp;<U+2013> in England up until the [[Debtors' Act of 1869]], individuals unable to pay their debts or fines could be detained in prison indefinitely to encourage payment. The conditions in the castle prison became increasingly notorious after a visit from the prison reformer [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]] in 1775 as part of his research for the first edition of his book ''The State of the Prisons'', published two years later. Howard found the prison "greatly out of repair", with the two inmates locked in a single room without exercise for the best of a year, with no fresh water, financial support or firewood.<ref>Brown, p. 182.</ref> Graffiti on the stone walls of the castle jail includes the mournful inscription by a prisoner of the period "For I have been here a great space; And I am weary of the place."<ref>King, p. 5.</ref>

In 1831 there were extensive riots in the Forest of Dean, led by [[Warren James]].<ref>Nicholls 1858, p. 122.</ref> After the intervention of the military, the rioters were dispersed and order restored, but a range of complaints were levied about the enforcement of the local laws on miners and metal-workers.<ref name=Nicholls1858P112>Nicholls 1858, p. 112.</ref> There had been attacks against St Briavels Castle by discontented locals before during the 1780s, but the degree of violence in this case was much greater.<ref>Fisher, 13.</ref> An [[act of Parliament]] followed, establishing a number of commissioners who investigated local practices and recent events at the Castle.<ref name=Nicholls1858P112/>

[[File:St Briavels Castle Debtors Prison.jpg|left|thumb|225px|The notorious [[debtors' prison]] at St Briavels Castle in early Victorian times.]]
The debtors' prison at the castle came in for particular scrutiny. It emerged that out of the 402 cases brought before the court at St Briavels' Castle, 397 of them were for extremely small sums of debt of <U+00A3>5 or less (<U+00A3>373 in 2009 prices), increasingly unacceptable in Victorian eyes.<ref name=Nicholls1858P113>Nicholls 1858, p. 113.</ref> A penalty of up to <U+00A3>7 (<U+00A3>522 in 2009 prices) was also being charged for each case, making the process extremely onerous for the local poor being prosecuted in this way.<ref name=Nicholls1858P113/> The investigation found that the keeper of the debtors' prison, which could hold up to six inmates at a time, was appointed by the constable, and made part of his income by charging each prisoner one shilling a week for the use of the beds in the prison; with no other public funding, prisoners depended on friends or relatives for food and other essentials, or from donations from their original [[parishes]].<ref>House of Lords, p. 40; Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline, p. 175.</ref>

The castle prison was found to still be in a very bad condition. The commissioners noted how the prison had "only one window, which is one foot wide and in a recess. It does not open.... There is a door at the outer end of the passage, and in it a hole which is considered necessary for air... The privy is a dark winding recess... It leads to a hole going down to the bottom of the building, which is always inaccessible for cleaning, but which until six years ago had a drain from it to the moat; the air draws up from it into the passage and the room. There is no water within for the prisoners' liberty, and they are obliged to get some person to fetch it."<ref>Nicholls 1858, pp. 113-4.</ref>

[[Prison reform]]s followed, including improving the conditions of the castle facilities, although visitors continued to note how the castle was "patched and cobbled like a worn-out shoe".<ref>Nicholls 1858, p. 114; The Saturday Magazine, p. 218.</ref> In 1838 the role of constable was transformed into the Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests.<ref>Nicholls 1858, p. 10.</ref> The court and jury rooms were turned into a local school,<ref>Curnow and Johnson, p. 95; Thomas, p. 59.</ref> although occasional [[Attachment (law)|Courts of Attachment]] were held in the chapel and the castle retained its function as a prison until 1842, when the remaining inmates were transferred to the prison at [[Littledean]].<ref>Thomas, p. 59; Kettilby, p. 668.</ref>

The gatehouse and the buildings inside the bailey were made habitable again in 1906 and became a [[Hostel|Youth Hostel]] in 1948. In 1961 the moat was partly infilled and turned into a garden.<ref>[http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=109524&sort=4&search=all&criteria=st%20briavels%20castle&rational=q&recordsperpage=10#aRt National Monuments Record, accessed 13 August 2010.].</ref> The castle is classed as a Grade I [[listed building]] and as a [[Scheduled Monument]].<ref>[http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=109524&sort=4&search=all&criteria=st%20briavels%20castle&rational=q&recordsperpage=10#aRt National Monuments Record, accessed 12 August 2010.]</ref> The site as a whole remains open to the public, managed by [[English Heritage]].
