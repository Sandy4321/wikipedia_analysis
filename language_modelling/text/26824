'''Leif Ericson''' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: '''Leifr Eir<U+00ED>ksson''')<ref>In [[Icelandic language|modern Icelandic]] the first name is '''Leifur''' and in [[Norwegian language|modern Norwegian]] '''Leiv'''. The [[patronym]] is Anglicized in various ways, such as '''Ericson''', '''Eriksson''', '''Ericsson''', '''Erickson''', '''Erikson''' and '''Eiriksson'''.</ref> (''[[circa|c.]]'' [[980]] &ndash; ''c.'' [[1020]]) was an Icelandic explorer who was the first [[Europe]]an known to have discovered [[North America]]&mdash;more specifically, the region that would become [[Newfoundland]] and, by later extension, [[Canada]].

It is believed that Leif was born around [[980]] (in [[Iceland]]), the second son of [[Erik the Red]] ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: ''Eir<U+00ED>kr rau<U+00F0>i''), a [[Norway|Norwegian]]-Icelandic [[outlaw]], himself the son of another Norwegian outlaw, [[<U+00DE>orvaldr <U+00C1>svaldsson]]. Leif's mother was Thorhild (''<U+00DE>j<U+00F3><U+00F0>hildr'').<ref>Sanderson, Jeanette. (2002) ''Explorers'', Teaching Resources/Scholastic. p. 14. ISBN 0-439-25181-8.</ref> Erik had started two Norse colonies, the Western Settlement and the Eastern Settlement, in [[Greenland]], which he had named. As far as it is known, Leif Ericson had two brothers, [[Thorvald Eriksson|<U+00DE>orvaldr]] and [[Thorstein Eir<U+00ED>ksson|<U+00DE>orsteinn]], and one sister, [[Freyd<U+00ED>s Eir<U+00ED>ksd<U+00F3>ttir|Freyd<U+00ED>s]]. Leif married a woman by the name of <U+00DE><U+00F3>rgunnr, and they had one son, [[Thorkell Leifsson|<U+00DE>orkell Leifsson]].

During a stay in Norway, Leif was converted to [[Christianity]], like many Norse around that time. He also went to Norway to serve the [[List of Norwegian monarchs|King of Norway]], [[Olaf I of Norway|Olaf Tryggvason]]. When he returned to Greenland, he bought the boat of [[Bjarni Herj<U+00F3>lfsson]], and set out to explore the land that Bjarni had found, today known as North America. 

The ''[[Saga of the Greenlanders]]'' tells that Leif set out around [[1000]] to follow Bjarni's circular route with 35 crew members, but in the opposite direction.<ref>Another saga, ''[[The Saga of Eric the Red]]'', relates that it was actually Leif who discovered the American mainland while returning from Norway to Greenland in [[1000]] or thereabouts; but the saga does not mention any attempts to settle there. However, the ''Saga of the Greenlanders'' is considered to be the more reliable of the two.</ref> The first land he met was covered with flat rock slabs (Old Norse: ''hellur''). He therefore called it [[Helluland]] ("Land of the Flat Stones"), probably the present day [[Baffin Island]]. Next he came to a land that was flat and wooded, with white sandy beaches, which he called [[Markland]] ("Wood-land"), usually assumed to have been [[Labrador]].

When Leif and his crew left Markland and found land again, they landed and built some houses. They found the land pleasant: there were plenty of [[salmon]] in the river, and the climate was mild, with little frost in the winter, and green grass year-round. They remained at this place over the winter. The sagas mention that one of Leif's men, Tyrkir, possibly a German warrior, found [[grape]]s, and that Leif named the country [[Vinland|V<U+00ED>nland]] after them.

On the return voyage, Leif rescued an Icelandic castaway named <U+00DE><U+00F3>rir and his crew &mdash; an incident that earned Leif the [[nickname]] 'Leif the Lucky' (Old Norse: ''Leifr hinn heppni'').

Research done in the [[1950s]] and [[1960s]] by explorer [[Helge Ingstad]] and his wife, archaeologist [[Anne Stine Ingstad|Anne Stine]], strongly suggests that the settlement of Leif Ericson and his party in V<U+00ED>nland was actually the tip of Newfoundland later known as [[L'Anse aux Meadows]].

In [[1964]], [[President of the United States]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] declared [[October 9]] to be "[[Leif Erikson Day]]" in the [[United States]].
