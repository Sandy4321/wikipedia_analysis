[[File:Batteuse 1881.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Horse-powered [[threshing machine]]]]The '''Swing Riots''' were a widespread uprising by agricultural workers; it began with the destruction of [[threshing machines]] in the [[Elham Valley]] area of [[East Kent]] in the summer of 1830, and by early December had spread throughout the whole of southern England and [[East Anglia]].<ref name="harrison249">Harrison. The Common People. pp. 249<U+2013>253</ref>   
As well as the attacks on the popularly hated, labour-displacing, threshing machines the protesters reinforced their demands with wage and tithe riots and by the destruction of objects of perceived oppression, such as [[workhouse]]s and [[tithe barn]]s, and also with the more surreptitious [[hay|rick]]-burning, and [[cattle]]-maiming.<ref name="harrison249"/> The first threshing machine was destroyed on Saturday night, 28&nbsp;August 1830, and by the third week of October more than 100&nbsp;threshing machines had been destroyed in [[East Kent]].<ref name="hungerfordmuseum">Hungerford Museum. The Swing Riots 1830.</ref> 

The anger of the rioters was directed at three targets that were seen as the prime source of their misery: the [[tithe]] system, the [[English Poor Laws|Poor Law]] guardians, and the rich [[tenant farmer]]s who had been progressively lowering wages while introducing [[agricultural machinery]].<ref name="harrison249"/>  If caught, the protesters faced charges of arson, robbery, riot, machine breaking and assault.<ref name="leslie74">Andrew Charlesworth, Brian Short and Roger Wells. Riots and Unrest ''in'' Kim Leslie's. An Historical atlas of Sussex. pp. 74<U+2013>75</ref> Those convicted faced imprisonment, transportation, and ultimately execution.<ref name="leslie74"/>

The Swing Riots had many immediate causes, but were overwhelmingly the result of the progressive impoverishment and dispossession of the English agricultural workforce over the previous fifty years, leading up to 1830.<ref name="harrison249"/> In parliament [[Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]] had said that the English labourer was reduced to a plight more abject than that of any race in Europe, with their employers no longer able to feed and employ them.<ref name="hammondxi">Hammond.

The name "Swing Riots" was derived from the name that was often appended to the threatening letters sent to farmers, [[magistrate]]s, [[parson]]s, and others, the fictitious [[Captain Swing]], who was regarded as the mythical figurehead of the movement.<ref name="horspool339">Horspool. ''The English Rebel''. pp.339<U+2013>340</ref> The Swing letters were first mentioned by ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper on 21&nbsp;October 1830.<ref name="times14363">The Times, Thursday, 21 October 1830; p. 3; Issue 14363; col C</ref>

==Background==
Early nineteenth-century England was virtually unique among major nations in having no class of landed smallholding [[peasant]]ry.<ref name="dorset">Coffin. The Dorset Page. Captain Swing in Dorset.</ref> Probably one of the main reasons for the Swing Riots were the [[Enclosure Acts]] of rural England.<ref name="hammond3" >Hammond. The Agricultural Labourer 1760<U+2013>1832. Chapter III Enclosure</ref> Between 1770 and 1830 about {{convert|6|e6acre|km2}} of common land were enclosed.<ref name="hammond3" /> The common land had been used for centuries by the poor of the countryside to graze their animals and grow their own produce.<ref name="hammond3" /> This land was now divided up among the large local landowners, leaving the landless farmworkers solely dependent upon working for their richer neighbours for a cash wage.<ref name="hammond3"/> Whilst this may have offered a tolerable living during the boom years of the [[Napoleonic wars]], when labour had been in short supply and corn prices high, the return of peace in 1815 brought with it plummeting grain prices and an oversupply of labour.<ref name="dorset"/> According to social historians [[John Lawrence Hammond|John and Barbara Hammond]], enclosure was fatal to three classes: the small farmer, the cottager and the squatter.<ref name="hammond97">Hammond. The Village Labourer, 1760<U+2013>1832. p.&nbsp;97</ref><ref name="elmes178">Elmes. Architectural Jurisprudence. Title LXVI. pp.&nbsp;178<U+2013>179. Definition of a cottage is a small house for habitation without land. Under an Elizabeth I statute they had to be built with at least {{convert|4|acre|m2}} of land. Thus a cottager is someone who lives in a cottage with a smallholding of land</ref> Before [[enclosure]] the cottager was a labourer with land; after enclosure he was a labourer without land.<ref name="hammond100">Hammond. The Village Labourer, 1760<U+2013>1832. p.&nbsp;100</ref>

In the 1780s workers would be employed at annual hiring fairs (or [[Mop Fair|mops]]), to serve for the whole year. During this period the worker would receive payment in kind and in cash from his employer, would often work at his side, and would commonly share meals at the employer's table. As time passed the gulf between farmer and employee widened. Workers were hired on stricter cash-only contracts, which ran for increasing shorter periods. First monthly terms became the norm; later contracts were offered for as little as a week.<ref name="hobsbawm18">Hobsbawm/ Rude. Captain Swing. pp.&nbsp;18<U+2013>33</ref> Between 1750 and 1850 the farm labourer faced the loss of his land, the transformation of his contract and the sharp deterioration of his economic situation by the time of the 1830 riots he had retained very little of his former status except the right to parish relief, under the [[Elizabethan Poor Law (1601)|Old Poor Law]] system.<ref name="hobsbawmxxi">Hobsbawm/ Rude. Captain Swing. pp.&nbsp;xxi<U+2013>xxii</ref> 

Historically the monasteries had taken responsibility for the [[Classifications of poor used in the Poor Law system|impotent poor]], but after their dissolution in 1536-9, it passed to the parishes.<ref name="sutton3242">Friar. Sutton Local History. pp.&nbsp;324<U+2013>325</ref> [[Poor Relief Act 1662|The Act of Settlement in 1662]], had confined relief strictly to those who were natives of the parish.<ref name="hobsbawm29">Hobsbawm/ Rude. Captain Swing. p.&nbsp;29</ref> The poor law system charged a [[Rates_(tax)#United_Kingdom|Parish Rate]] to landowners and tenants, which was used to provide relief payments to settled residents of the parish who were ill or out of work.<ref name="hobsbawm29"/> These payments were minimal, and at times degrading conditions were required for their receipt.<ref name="harrison249"/><ref name="sutton3242"/> As more and more people became dependent on parish relief, ratepayers rebelled ever more loudly against the costs, and a lower and lower level of relief was offered.<ref name="hammond183">Hammonds. The Village Labourer. pp.&nbsp;183<U+2013>185</ref> Three and a half "one gallon" bread loaves were considered necessary for a man in [[Berkshire]] in 1795.<ref name="hammond183"/> However provision had fallen to just two similar-sized loaves being provided in 1817 [[Wiltshire]].<ref name="hammond183"/> The way in which poor law funds were disbursed led to a further reduction in agricultural wages, since farmers would pay their workers as little as possible, knowing that the parish fund would top up wages to a basic subsistence level (see [[Speenhamland system]]).<ref name="hammond183"/><ref name="friar324">Friar. Sutton Companion to Local History. pp.&nbsp;324<U+2013>325</ref>

To this mixture was added the burden of the [[Tithe#England|church tithe]].<ref name="hobsbawm14">Hobsbawm/ Rude. Captain Swing. pp.&nbsp;14<U+2013>15
</ref> Originally this had been the church's right to a tenth of the parish harvest.<ref name="hobsbawm14"/> However the earlier collection of goods in kind had been replaced by a cash levy that was payable to the [[Church of England]] Parson and went to pay his (often considerable) wages.<ref name="lee27">Lee. Rural Society and the Anglican Clergy 1815<U+2013>1914. pp.&nbsp;27<U+2013>29</ref> The cash levy was generally rigorously enforced, whether the resident was a Church member or not, and the sum demanded was often far higher than a poor person could afford.<ref name="lee27"/> Calls for a large reduction in the tithe payment were prominent among the demands of the rioters.<ref name="lee27"/>

The final straw was the introduction of horse-powered threshing machines, which could do the work of many men.<ref name="harrison249"/><ref name="hobsbawmiv">Hobsbawm/Rude. Captain Swing. Appendix IV</ref> They spread swiftly among the farming community, threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of farmworkers.<ref name="hobsbawmiv"/> Following the terrible harvests of 1828 and 1829, farm labourers faced the approaching winter of 1830 with dread.<ref name="harrison249"/>

==Rioting==
[[File:Swingletter.jpg|right|thumb|Typical 'Swing' letter]]
Starting in the south-eastern county of [[Kent]], the Swing Rioters smashed the threshing machines and threatened farmers who had them.<ref name="hobsbawm71">Hobsbawm/ Rude. Captain Swing. p. 71</ref> The riots spread rapidly through the southern counties of [[Surrey]], [[Sussex]], [[Middlesex]] and [[Hampshire]], before spreading north into the [[Home Counties]], the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and [[East Anglia]].<ref name="hammondxi"/> Moving on as far as [[Lincolnshire]], [[Yorkshire]] and [[Nottinghamshire]].<ref name="hammondxi"/> Originally the disturbances were thought to be mainly a southern and East Anglian phenomenon, but subsequent research has revealed just how widespread Swing riots really were, with virtually every county south of the Scottish border involved.<ref>John Beckett  "Swing riots"  The Oxford Companion to British History. Oxford Reference Online.</ref> In all sixty per cent of the disturbances were concentrated in (Berkshire 165, Hampshire 208, Kent 154, Sussex 145, Wiltshire 208); whereas East Anglia had fewer incidents (Cambridge 17, Norfolk 88, Suffolk 40), while the south<U+2010>west, the midlands and the north were only marginally affected.<ref name="armstrong75">Armstrong. Farmworkers: A Social and Economic History, 1770<U+2013>1980. p. 75 and Table 3.1</ref> 

The tactics varied from county to county but typically, threatening letters, often signed by Captain Swing, would be sent to magistrates, parsons, wealthy farmers or Poor Law guardians in the area.<ref name="hobsbawmc10">Hobsbawm/ Rude. Captain Swing. Ch. 10</ref> The letters would call for a rise in wages, a cut in the [[tithe]] payments and for the destruction of threshing machines, otherwise people would take matters into their own hands.<ref name="hobsbawmc10"/> If the warnings were not heeded local farmworkers would gather, often in groups of 200 <U+2013> 400, and would threaten the local oligarchs with dire consequences if their demands were not met.<ref name="hobsbawmc10"/> Threshing machines would be broken, workhouses and tithe barns would be attacked and then the rioters would disperse or move on to the next village.<ref name="hobsbawmc10"/> The buildings containing the engines that powered the threshing machines were also a target of the rioters and many ''[[gin gang]]s'', also known as ''horse engine houses'' or ''wheelhouses'', were destroyed, particularly in south<U+2212>east England.<ref name="HuttonAHR-1976">Hutton. The distribution of wheelhouses in Britain. pp. 30<U+2013>35</ref> Other actions included incendiary attacks on farms, barns and hayricks in the dead of night, as it was easier then to avoid detection.<ref name="hobsbawmc10"/> Although a lot of the actions of the rioters, such as arson, were conducted in secret at night, meetings with farmers and overseers about the grievances were conducted in daylight.<ref name="harrison249" />

Despite the prevalence of the slogan "Bread or Blood", only one person is recorded as having been killed during the riots, and that was one of the rioters by the action of a soldier or farmer.<ref name="harrison249" /> The rioters only intent being to damage property.<ref name="hobsbawmc10"/>
Similar patterns of disturbances, and their rapid spread across the country, were often blamed on agitators or on "agents" sent from France, where the [[July Revolution|revolution of July 1830]] had broken out a month before the Swing Riots began in Kent.<ref name="smith16">Smith. ''One Monday in November... And Beyond''. p.16.</ref>

Despite all of the different tactics used by the agricultural workers during the unrest, their principle aims were simply to attain a minimum living wage and to end rural unemployment.<ref name="hobsbawmc10"/>

==Aftermath==
[[File:Charlesgrey2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey]]

Eventually the farmers agreed to raise wages, and the parsons and some landlords reduced the tithes and rents.<ref name="leslie74"/> But many farmers reneged on the agreements and the unrest increased.<ref name="leslie74"/> Many people advocated political reform as the only solution to the unrest. <ref name="leslie74"/> This included [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]], who speaking in a debate in  the House of Lords in November suggested the best way to reduce the violence was to introduce reform of the House of Commons.<ref name="hansard37">Hansard. ADDRESS IS ANSWER TO THE SPEECH.

[[File:2nd V Melbourne.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Lord Melbourne]]
On 15 November 1830 Wellington's government was defeated in a vote in the House of Commons. Two days later, Earl Grey  was asked to form a [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] government.<ref name="gash1"/><ref name="mandler1">Mandler, <U+2018>Lamb, William, second Viscount Melbourne (1779<U+2013>1848)<U+2019></ref> Grey assigned a cabinet committee to produce a plan for parliamentary reform.<ref name="mandler1"/>  [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]] became Home Secretary in the new government. 

During the disturbances of 1830<U+2013>32, Melbourne ''acted vigorously and sensitively, and it was for this that his reforming brethren thanked him heartily''.<ref name="mandler1"/> Melbourne blamed local magistrates for being too lenient and the government appointed a Special Commission of three judges to try rioters in the counties of [[Berkshire]], [[Buckinghamshire]], [[Dorset]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Hampshire]].<ref name="dorset"/>

The landowning class in England felt severely threatened by the riots, and responded with harsh punitive measures.<ref name="harrison249" /> Nearly 2000 protesters were brought to trial in 1830<U+2013>1831;<ref name="harrison249"/> 252 were sentenced to death (though only 19 were actually hanged), 644 were imprisoned, and 481 were transported to penal colonies in Australia.<ref name="harrison249"/><ref name="douglas297">Brian T.

The authorities had received many requests to prosecute radical politician and writer [[William Cobbett]] for the speeches he had made in defence of the rural labourer; however it was for his articles in the ''[[Political Register]]'' that he was eventually charged with [[seditious libel]].<ref name="hammondxi"/><ref name=hansard2>Hansard.COBBETT'S REGISTER<U+2014> INFLAMMATORY PUBLICATIONS, Debate.HC Deb 23 December 1830 vol 2 cc71-81</ref>He wrote an article entitled ''The Rural War'' that was about the Swing Riots. He blamed those in society who lived off unearned income at the expense of hard-working agricultural labourers; his solution was parliamentary reform.<ref name=dyck7>Dyck.

He tried to ask the government ministers awkward questions supporting his case, but they were disallowed by the Lord Chief Justice. However, he was able to discredit the prosecution's case, and at great embarrassment to the government he was acquitted.<ref name="hammondxi"/>

The 'Swing' riots were a major influence on the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] Government. They added to the strong social, political and agricultural unrest throughout Britain in the 1830s, encouraging a wider demand for  political reform, culminating in the introduction of the [[Reform Act 1832]];<ref name="leslie74"/><ref name="hammondxi"/> and also to the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]] ending "outdoor relief" in cash or kind, and setting up a chain of [[workhouse]]s across the country, to which the poor had to go if they wanted help.<ref name="green13">Green.
