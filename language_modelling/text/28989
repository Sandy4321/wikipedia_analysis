The '''NBA Store''' is a series of officially licensed [[retailers]] which sell [[merchandise]] for the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). The most prominent of these stores was located in the [[United States]] on [[Fifth Avenue]] and [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]], [[Manhattan]], [[New York]]. There are two other locations in [[Beijing]], [[People's Republic of China|China]].

The New York location sold many basketball related items and featured several attractions; it was often visited by transient players, celebrities, and political leaders. It also served as a headquarters for the NBA where the association hosts charity events.

Since opening its first store in 1998, the NBA has seen increasing business opportunities in foreign markets mainly due to the influx of new [[National Basketball Association|international players]]. The biggest growth has been in China, where players [[Yao Ming]] and [[Yi Jianlian]], combined with the interest generated by the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], created enough demand to open two new stores. The NBA has also expanded into games like [[Second Life]] where it created a virtual NBA Store in 2007.  

The Fifth Avenue store closed on February 13, 2011. The league is currently searching for a new location.
