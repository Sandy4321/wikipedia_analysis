==Career==
Vic Aldridge was a dependable second or third starter throughout most of his career.  He was known for his curve ball and pinpoint accuracy.  He began his pro-career by signing a contract with Indianapolis of the [[American Association]] in 1915, but first played for Denver of the [[Western League]] and then Erie of the [[Central League]].  He played for Indianapolis in 1916, where he was scouted for the Chicago Cubs<ref>http://www.baseballhistorian.com/html/american_heroes.cfm?page=153</ref>  He batted and threw right.<ref>http://www.baseballhistorian.com/html/american_heroes.cfm?page=153</ref>

He spent [[1917]] and [[1918]] with the Chicago Cubs, serving in the [[bullpen]].  In 1917 he played in thirty games, winning six games, losing six games, with a 3.12 earned run average and two saves.  In 1918 he played only three games, pitching only twelve innings, before joining the [[United States Navy]] during the final year of [[World War I]].  After returning from World War I, he played for the [[Los Angeles Angels (PCL)|Los Angeles Angels]], an affiliate of the Chicago Cubs, in the [[Pacific Coast League]].  He returned to the Cubs for the [[1922]] season.  He played the next three years for the Chicago Cubs, with consistent performances in the three years.  In 1922, 1923, and 1924 he played 36, 30, and 32 games respectively, with 16, 16, and 15 wins in the three seasons, with respective earned run averages of 3.52, 3.48, and 3.50.  During this time his son Vic Aldridge Jr. served as the Chicago Cubs bat boy, and even had an uniform donated by [[Mordecai Brown]] so he looked the part.<ref>Thomson, Cindy. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=Us8oN1PFtMYC Three Finger: the Mordecai Brown Story]]'' (University of Nebraska Press, 2006) pg.203</ref><ref>http://www.baseball-reference.com/a/aldrivi01.shtml</ref>

Vic Aldridge was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates after the [[1924]] season on October 27, 1924, along with [[George Grantham]] and [[Al Niehaus]], for [[Wilbur Cooper]], [[Charlie Grimm]], and [[Rabbit Maranville]].  The change in stadiums prompted him to rely more on his fastball than his curveball, as he felt he needed to protect himself from home runs in Wrigley Field and its smaller field, thus using the curveball to reduce the risk of being homered against, but the larger field in Pittsburgh made fastballs safer to use, and thus a better pitch to rely upon.<ref>James, Bill. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=9i8cr_g8hHIC The Neyer/James guide to pitchers]'' (Simon and Schuster, 2004) pg.117</ref>  The next year, he won fifteen games (ninth highest total in the National League in 1925), losing seven, for a .682 win percentage that was the fourth highest for any National League pitcher that year.  Aldridge's finest moments were in the postseason that year when he pitched two complete game victories against the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]] as the Pirates won the [[1925 World Series|World Series]].  He won game two of the series 3-2 on October 8, 1925, and the game five at a score of 6-3, the first two wins the Pirates had that series.  Aldridge used the money from the World Series to buy a home in Terre Haute, Indiana.<ref>Finoli, David.

Vic Aldridge also started the seventh game on October 15, 1925.  It had been raining for a week in Pittsburgh, and the sixth game had been rainy.  The weather for the seventh was even worse, and the game was played in thick [[pea soup]] [[fog]] and [[drizzle]], with a very wet pitching mound.  It was hoped that Aldridge would continue his success in the first two games to the seventh, but it was not to be.  Although noted for his consistency, in this game Aldridge was very wild; he had had only two days rest and he kept slipping on the slick pitcher's plate.  [[Sam Rice]] was first at bat, and hit a single.  Then [[Bucky Harris]] came out, who's fly out was the only success Aldridge had during the game.  [[Goose Goslin]] was walked after a wild pitch.  [[Joe Harris]] was walked after a wild pitch advanced the baserunners.  After a full count, [[Joe Judge]] was walked, scoring in one run.  Then [[Ossie Bluege]] hit a single.  Pirates manager [[Bill McKechnie]] had seen enough and relieved Aldridge   In total, Aldridge gave up three walks, two hits, and two wild pitches, resulting in the Senators having a 4-0 lead in the first inning.  The Pirates would rally to win the game and the World Series with a score of 9-7, the first time a team won the World Series after a 3-1 deficit.  It was the worst start of the seventh game for a pitcher in World Series history.<ref>Levenson pg.26</ref><ref>Finoli pg.366</ref><ref>Koppett, Leonard. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=cjrbVkGAsHcC Koppett's Concise History of Major League Baseball]'' (Carroll & Graf, 2004) pg.160</ref>

In 1926 he suffered with a ten win, thirteen loss record, with a 4.07 earned run average.<ref>http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=aldrivi01</ref><ref>Finoli pg.366</ref>

The 1927 was a better year for Vic Aldridge.  Aldridge won fifteen games, losing only ten, with a 4.25 earned run average.  Vic Aldridge also played in the 1927 World Series, losing the second game of the series 6-2 as the [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Lou Gehrig]] led [[New York Yankees]] swept the Pirates in four games.  He gave up all six runs in the seven and a third innings he pitched.<ref>http://www.baseballhistorian.com/html/american_heroes.cfm?page=153</ref><ref>Finoli pg.366</ref><ref>http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=aldrivi01</ref>

After winning 15 games again in [[1927]], Vic Aldridge expected a raise, but instead Pittsburgh owner [[Barney Dreyfuss]] traded him to the [[New York Giants]] on February 11, 1928 for [[Burleigh Grimes]]; citing Aldridge's 4.25 ERA in 1927 as a reason not to give him a raise.<ref>Finoli pg.366</ref>  He held out for much of the year; by the time he returned, he was out of shape and pitched poorly.  During this time Aldridge refused to report, John McGraw threatened Aldridge with less pay, and at one point tried to trade him to the [[Cincinnati Reds]].  After the season, where Aldridge's record was four wins and seven losses, with a 4.83 earned run average after 119 innings pitched, he was sent to the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]].  However, Aldridge refused to report and retired from baseball instead.<ref>'''Reds Decline McGraw's Offer Of Vic Aldridge in Trade''' ''[[New York Times]]'' March 31, 1928</ref><ref>http://www.baseball-reference.com/a/aldrivi01.shtml</ref>

In total, Vic Aldridge pitched 1601 innings, won 97 games, lost 80, had 102 complete games, and had a combined earned run average of 3.76.  [[Rogers Hornsby]] said that Aldridge had one of the three best curveballs he had ever seen.  His batting average was .229, a respectable average for a pitcher.  Aldridge twice attempted to steal a base, one each in 1922 and 1926, and succeeded both times.<ref>http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Vic_Aldridge_1893&page=stats</ref><ref>http://www.thetoolsofignorance.com/stats/player.php?id=aldrivi01</ref><ref>James 117</ref>

==Post career==
After his playing career ended, Vic Aldridge went to law school at the Voorhees School of Law and served in the Indiana state senate from [[1937]] to [[1948]].  He was first elected on November 4, 1936, as a Democrat.  He served as a schoolmaster full-time before his baseball career, and after his baseball career he served as schoolmaster part-time, hence his nickname "The Hoosier Schoolmaster".<ref>'''Democrats Elect Vic Aldridge to Indiana Senate''' ''[[Washington Post]]'' November 5, 1936</ref><ref>http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=aldrivi01</ref><ref>Finoli pg.366</ref>

Vic Aldridge was inducted into the [[Indiana Baseball Hall of Fame]] on [[January 19]], [[2007]] as its 131st member. His granddaughter, Mary Turner, and grandson, Vic Aldridge III, accepted the award on his behalf. He is buried in Trinity Springs Cemetery of [[Trinity Springs, Indiana]].<ref>http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=aldrivi01</ref><ref>McCormick, Mike  '''[http://www.tribstar.com/archivesearch/local_story_027232126.html Historical Perspecitve: William Benjamin Caulk acclaimed as magician]''' ''The Tribune Star'' January 27, 2007</ref>
