'''Halestorm''' is an American [[hard rock]] band from [[Red Lion, York County, Pennsylvania|Red Lion, Pennsylvania]].{{r|biosummary}} The group's [[Halestorm (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released on April 28, 2009 through [[Atlantic Records]].

==History==
Siblings Arejay and Elizabeth "Lzzy" Hale have been actively writing and performing original music since 1998 when they were 10 and 13 years old, respectively. Both brother and sister started learning piano at the age of 5; Lzzy later progressed to a [[keytar]] and Arejay to the [[drum kit|drums]]. Lzzy took guitar lessons at 16. The teen siblings released an [[extended play|EP]] titled ''Don't Mess With the Time Man'' in 2000. In Halestorm's earliest incarnation, Lzzy and Arejay's father played bass before Josh Smith joined the group in 2004. Guitarist Joe Hottinger joined in 2003.

The group signed a recording contract with [[Atlantic Records]] on June 28, 2005 and released a live EP titled ''One and Done''. The EP, now out of print, featured an early live version of "It's Not You." Their [[Halestorm (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released on April 28, 2009. The song "I Get Off" served as the album's [[lead single]] and has gained heavy radio play. Both the song and video for their second single, "It's Not You", were released in late November 2009. In early 2010, the band released a promotional music video for their song "Love/Hate Heartbreak". Their most recent single, "Familiar Taste of Poison", was released in 2010.{{r|erg}} The official music video was released on August 10, 2010.

Lzzy Hale's use of Gibson guitars is well known; models she plays includes the Tribal Flying V, Gibson Explorer, Les Paul Custom, Firebird and the Joan Jett Signature Melody Maker.{{r|gibson}} Arejay Hale was featured in the June 2010 issue of ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' magazine, and is endorsed by [[Ludwig-Musser|Ludwig Drums]], [[Avedis Zildjian Company|Zildjian Cymbals]] and [[Pro-Mark]] Drumsticks.
