[[File:Map3.8Government Participation by Women compressed.jpg|right|thumb| 350px| A world map showing countries governmental participation by women, 2010.]]

'''Women and governance''' worldwide reflect the current transitions in women's roles and the evolution of modern governance systems in general. A broad range of political systems have been founded on principles that support participation by women in government, through the influence of [[feminism]]'s growth during recent centuries, and more particularly, the proliferation of popular awareness of feminist ideas. The reality of women's activities in government institutions is in some instances relegated to superficial and symbolic functions empty of means to directly affect local, national, or international matters. On the other hand, gradual change has led to an increasing number of women participating in the decision-making forums that hold real power to impact legislation, policies and programs. 

==Overview==
Increasing women<U+2019>s representation in governance is necessary to achieve gender parity.<ref name="unicef.org">UNICEF. 2006. <U+201C>Equality in Politics and Government<U+201D> and <U+201C>Reaping the Double Dividend of Gender Equality,<U+201D> in The State of the World Children 2007, pp. 51<U+2013>87. New York: The United Nations Children<U+2019>s Fund. http://www.unicef.org/sowc07/report/report.php</ref>  The third [[Millennium Development Goal]] calls for [[gender equality]] and women<U+2019>s empowerment.<ref>http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/gender.shtml</ref> Increasing women<U+2019>s representation in the spheres of governance can, in turn, result in increased female empowerment.<ref name="unicef.org"/>This notion of women<U+2019>s empowerment is rooted in the human [[capabilities approach]], in which individuals are empowered to choose the functioning that they deem valuable.<ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003"/> Women<U+2019>s access to [[education]], [[nutrition]], and [[healthcare]] are central capabilities that influence their ability to enter the spheres of governance. Women in governance is a significant area in which increased gender parity may initiate a cycle to ultimately increase opportunities and capabilities of women and children worldwide.

Women, as the conventional primary caretakers of children, often have a more prominent role than men in advocating for children, resulting in a <U+201C>double dividend<U+201D> in terms of the benefits of women<U+2019>s representation.<ref name="unicef.org"/> Women representatives not only advance women<U+2019>s rights, but also advance the rights of children.  In national legislatures, there is a notable trend of women advancing gender and family friendly legislation.  This advocacy has been seen in countries ranging from France, Sweden and the Netherlands, to South Africa, Rwanda, and Egypt.  Furthermore, a number of studies from both industrialized and developed countries indicate that women in local government tend to advance social issues.  In India, for instance, greater women<U+2019>s representation has corresponded with a more equitable distribution of community resources, including more gender-sensitive spending on programs related to health, nutrition, and education.

In recent decades there has been a shift from a [[Sovereign state|state]]-centered definition of [[governance]] to a more encompassing definition that includes three areas of social action: the state, the market, and the [[civil society]].<ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003">Basu, Amriyta; Jayal, Naraja Gopal; Nussbaum, Martha; Tambiah, Yasmin. 2003. Essays on Gender and Governance. India: Human Development Resource Center, United Nations Development Programme.</ref>  The notion of governance includes how these entities interact, whether working together or in opposition.  Rather than being structure-based, governance is now defined as being more process-based.  This broader conception of governance allows for more organizations, and the relationships between them, to be included in its definition.  For example, these institutions include civil society organizations ([[social movements]], [[non-governmental organizations]], civic associations), private corporations, and market institutions.  These three domains of governance <U+2013> the state, the market, and the civil society <U+2013> exist on multiple levels.  These levels of governance include global, national, and local levels.  On each of these three levels, there is now greater emphasis on participation, [[decentralization]], and accountability.


==Challenges faced by women==
Women face numerous obstacles in achieving representation in governance.<ref name="unicef.org"/>  Their participation has been limited by the assumption that women<U+2019>s proper sphere is the <U+201C>private<U+201D> sphere.  Whereas the <U+201C>public<U+201D> domain is one of political authority and contestation, the <U+201C>private<U+201D> realm is associated with the family and the home.<ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003"/>  By relegating women to the private sphere, their ability to enter the political arena is curtailed.

Gender inequality within families, inequitable [[division of labor]] within households, and cultural attitudes about [[gender roles]] further subjugate women and serve to limit their representation in public life.<ref name="unicef.org"/>  Societies that are highly [[patriarchal]] often have local power structures that make it difficult for women to combat.<ref name="Social Development 2005">United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD). 2005. Gender Equality: Striving for Justice in an Unequal World. France: UNRISD.</ref>  Thus, their interests are often not represented.

Even once elected, women tend to hold lesser valued cabinet ministries or similar positions.<ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003"/>  These are described as <U+201C>soft industries<U+201D> and include health, education, and welfare.  Rarely do women hold executive decision-making authority in more powerful domains or those that are associated with traditional notions of masculinity (such as finance and the military).  Typically, the more powerful the institution, the less likely it is that women<U+2019>s interests will be represented.  Additionally, in more autocratic nations, women are less likely to have their interests represented.<ref name="Social Development 2005"/> Many women attain political standing due to kinship ties, as they have male family members who are involved in politics.<ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003"/> These women tend to be from higher income, higher status families and thus may not be as focused on the issues faced by lower income families.

==Policies to increase women<U+2019>s participation==
The United Nations has identified six avenues by which female participation in politics and governance may be strengthened. These avenues are: equalization of educational opportunities, quotas for female participation in governing bodies, legislative reform to increase focus on issues concerning women and children, financing gender-responsive budgets to equally take into account the needs of men and women, increasing the presence of sex-disaggregated statistics in national research/data, and furthering the presence and agency of grassroots women<U+2019>s [[empowerment]] movements <ref name="unicef.org"/>

===Education===
Women with formal education (at any level) are likelier to delay marriage and subsequent childbirth, be better informed about infant/child nutrition, and ensure childhood immunization. Children of mothers with formal education are better nourished and have higher survival rates.<ref name="unicef.org"/> Equalization of educational opportunities for boys and girls may take the form of several initiatives:

* abolishment of educational fees which would require parents to consider financial issues when deciding which of their children to educate. Poor children in rural areas are particularly affected by inequality resulting from educational fees.<ref>United Nations Children<U+2019>s Fund and World Bank, <U+2018>Building on what we know and defining sustained support<U+2019>, School Fee Abolition Initiative Workshop, organized by UNICEF and the World Bank, Nairobi, 5<U+2013>7 April 2006, p. 3</ref>

* encouragement of parents and communities to institute gender-equal educational agendas. Perceived [[opportunity cost]] of educating girls may be addressed through a [[conditional cash transfer]] program which financially reward families who educate their daughters (thus removing the financial barrier that results from girls substituting school attendance for work in the family labor force).<ref>United Nations Children<U+2019>s Fund, The State of the World<U+2019>s Children 2004: Girls<U+2019> education and development, UNICEF, New York, 2003.</ref>
*creation of <U+201C>girl-friendly<U+201D> schools to minimize bias and create a safe school environment for girls and young women. Currently, a barrier to female school attendance is the risk of [[sexual violence]] en route to school.<ref name="Fund 2004">United Nations Children<U+2019>s Fund, The State of the World<U+2019>s Children 2004.</ref> A <U+201C>safe school environment<U+201D> is one in which the school is located to minimize such violence, in addition to providing girls with educational opportunities (as opposed to using female students to perform janitorial work or other menial labor).<ref name="Fund 2004"/>

===Quotas===
Quotas are mechanisms by which governments seek to numerically increase the numbers of female represented in the governing body.<ref name="Fund 2004"/> Types of quotas include:<ref name="Fund 2004"/>
* Gender quota systems: institute a <U+201C>critical value<U+201D> below which is deemed an imbalanced government. Examples of such critical values include 20% of legislators, 50% of politicians, etc.
* Legal quota systems regulate the governance of political parties and bodies. Such quotas may be mandated by electoral law (as in Ecuador, for example) or may be constitutionally required (as in Nepal).
* Voluntary party quota systems may be used by [[political parties]] at will, yet are not mandated by electoral law or by a country<U+2019>s constitution. If a country<U+2019>s leading or majority political party engages in a voluntary party quota system, the effect may <U+201C>trickle down<U+201D> to minority political parties in the country (as in the case of the African National Congress in South Africa).
Quotas may be utilized during different stages of the political nomination/selection process to address different junctures at which women may be inherently disadvantaged:<ref name="Fund 2004"/>
* Potential candidacy: gender quota systems can mandate that from the pool of aspirants, a certain percentage of them must be female.
* Nomination: legal or voluntary quotas are enforced upon this stage, during which a certain portion of nominated candidates on the party<U+2019>s ballot must be female.
* Election: <U+201C>reserved seats<U+201D> may be filled only by women.
Quota usage can have marked effects on female representation in governance. In 1995, Rwanda ranked 24th in terms of female representation, and jumped to 1st in 2003 after quotas were introduced. Similar effects can be seen in Argentina, Iraq, Burundi, Mozambique, and South Africa, for example.<ref name="Fund 2004"/> Of the top-ranked 20 countries in terms of female representation in government, 17 of these countries utilize some sort of quota system to ensure female inclusion. Though such inclusion is mainly instituted at the national level, there have been efforts in India to addresses female inclusion at the subnational level, through quotas for parliamentary positions.<ref>Inter-Parliamentary Union, <U+2018>Women in Parliaments: World classification<U+2019>, <www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classsif.htm>; and International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance and Stockholm University, <U+2018>Global Database of
Quotas for Women<U+2019>, www.quotaproject.org/country.cfm?SortOrder=LastLowerPercenta</ref>

===Legislation===
Legislative agendas, some pushed by female political figures, may focus on several key issues to address ongoing gender disparities:
* Reducing domestic and gender-based violence. The Convention on the Rights of the Child, in 1989, addressed home violence and its effects on children. The Convention stipulates that children are holders of human rights, and authorizes the State to 1) prevent all forms of violence, and 2) respond to past violence effectively.<ref>United Nations, Report of the independent expert for the United Nations study on violence against children, Provisional version, UN A/61/150 and Corr. 1, United Nations, New York, 23 August 2005</ref> Gender-based violence, such as the use of rape as a tool of warfare, was addressed in Resolution 1325 of the UN Security Council in 2000. It calls for <U+201C>all parties of armed conflict to take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence.<U+201D> <ref>United Nations, Security Council Resolution 1325, para. 10, adopted by the Security Council at its 4213th Meeting, United Nations, New York, 31 October 2000</ref>  Currently, 64 countries have either drafted or are in the process of drafting laws to criminalize gender violence.<ref name="unicef.org"/>
* Reducing in-home discrimination through equalizing [[property]] and [[inheritance]]  rights. National legislation can supersede traditionally male-dominated inheritance models. Such legislation has been proven effective in countries like Colombia, where 60% of land is held in joint titles between men and women (compared to 18% before the passage of joint titling legislation in 1996).<ref>King, Elizabeth M., and Andrew D. Mason, <U+2018>Engendering Development Through Gender Equality in Rights, Resources, and Voice<U+2019>, World Bank and Oxford University Press, Washington, D.C., January 2001, p. 120</ref>

===Financing===
Gender-responsive budgets address the needs and interests of different individuals and social groups, maintaining awareness of gender issues within the formation of policies and budgets. Such budgets are not necessarily a 50-50 male-female split, but accurately reflect the needs of each gender (such as increased allocation for women<U+2019>s reproductive health.<ref name="United Nations Development Programme 2005">United Nations Development Programme, Gender-Based Budgeting: Manual for Trainers. 2005.</ref> Benefits of gender-responsive budgets include:
* Improved budget efficiency by ensuring that funds are allocated where they are needed most
* Strengthened government position by advocating for needs of all, including the poor and the underrepresented
* Increased information flow surrounding needs of those who are usually discriminated against
A gender-responsive budget may also work to address issues of unpaid care work and caring labor gaps.<ref name="United Nations Development Programme 2005"/>

===Research/data improvements===
Current research which uses sex-aggregated statistics may underplay or minimize the quantitative presentation of issues such as maternal mortality, violence against women, and girls<U+2019> school attendance.<ref>UNICEF. 2006. <U+201C>Equality in Politics and Government<U+201D> and <U+201C>Reaping the Double Dividend of Gender Equality,<U+201D> in The State of the World Children 2007, pp. 51<U+2013>87. New York: The United Nations Children<U+2019>s Fund. ttp://www.unicef.org/sowc07/report/report.php</ref> Sex-disaggregated statistics are lacking in the assessment of maternal mortality rates, for example. Prior to [[UNICEF]] and [[UNIFEM]] efforts to gather more accurate and comprehensive data, 62 countries had no recent national data available regarding maternal mortality rates.<ref>United Nations, The World<U+2019>s Women 2005: Progress in statistics, United Nations Division of Economic and Social Affairs, New York, 2006, p. 26</ref> Only 38 countries have sex-disaggregated statistics available to report frequency of violence against women.<ref name="United Nations 2006">United Nations, Department of Social and Economic Affairs, The World<U+2019>s Women 2005: Progress in Statistics, United Nations, New York, 2006.</ref> 41 countries collect sex-disaggregated data on school attendance, while 52 countries assess sex-disaggregated wage statistics.<ref name="United Nations 2006"/>

===Grassroots women<U+2019>s empowerment movements===
Women<U+2019>s informal collectives are crucial to improving the standard of living for women worldwide. Collectives can address such issues as nutrition, education, shelter, food distribution, and generally improved standard of living.<ref>McNulty, Stephanie, <U+2018>Women<U+2019>s Organizations During and After War: From service delivery to policy advocacy<U+2019>, Research and Reference Services Project, United States Agency for International Development Center for
Development Information and Evaluation, Washington, D.C., 2 October 1998, p. 3.</ref> Empowering such collectives can increase their reach to the women most in need of support and empowerment.

==Case studies==
===Brazil===
A 1995 Brazilian gender quota was extended first to city councilor positions in 1996, then extended to candidates of all political legislative positions by 1998.<ref>Sacchet, Teresa. "Beyond Numbers -- The Impact of Gender Quotas in Latin America" International Feminist Journal of Politics 10.3 (2008)</ref> By 1998, 30% of political candidates had to be women, with varied results in terms of the gender balance of the officials ultimately elected. Though the percentage of national legislature seats occupied by women dropped in the initial years following the passage of the quota law, the percentage has since risen (from 6.2% pre-quota, to 5.7% in 1998, to 8.9% in 2006). However, Brazil has struggled with the quota law in several respects:
* Though the quota law mandates a certain percentage of candidate spots be reserved for women, it is not compulsory that those spots be filled by women.
* The quota law also allowed political parties to increase the number of candidates, further increasing electoral competition and having a negligible impact on the actual number of women elected.
* Brazil is the fifth-largest country in the world (in terms of both population size and also land area), making it difficult for women to accept the distance from home which would accompany traveling to seek a spot in the national legislative body.

===Finland===
The Finnish national quota law, introduced in 1995, mandates that among all indirectly elected public bodies (at both a national and a local level), at least 40% of the governing body must be female.<ref>Holli, Anne Maria; Luhtakallio, Eeva; Raevaara, Eeva. "Quota trouble: Talking about gender quotas in finnish local politics" International Feminist Journal of Politics 8.2 (2006).</ref> The 1995 laws was a reformed version of a similar 1986 law. Unlike other countries<U+2019> quota laws, which affect party structure or electoral candidate lists, the Finnish law addresses indirectly elected bodies (nominated by official authorities)<U+2014>the law does not address popularly elected bodies. The Finnish law heavily emphasizes local municipal boards and other subnational institutions. From 1993 (pre-quota law) to 1997 (post-quota law), the proportion of women on municipal executive boards increased from 25% to 45%. The quota law also affected gender segregation in local governance: before the passage of the law, there had been a gender imbalance in terms of female overrepresentation in <U+201C>soft-sector<U+201D> boards (those concerned with health, education, etc.) and female underrepresentation in <U+201C>hard-sector<U+201D> boards (those concerned with economics and technology). In 1997, the boards were balanced horizontally. However, areas not subject to quota laws continue to be imbalanced. In 2003, it was determined that only 16% of the chairs of municipal executive boards are female<U+2014>chair positions in this area are not quota-regulated.<ref>Pikkala, S. 2000. <U+2018>Representations of Women in Finnish Local Government: Effects of the 1995 Gender Quota Legislation<U+2019>, paper presented at the European Consortium on Political Research Joint Sessions of Workshops, Copenhagen, 14<U+2013> 19 April.

===Spain===
In 2007, Spain passed the Equality Law, requiring a <U+201C>principle of balanced presence<U+201D> by mandating political parties to include 40-60% of each sex among electoral candidates.<ref>Verge, T<U+00E0>nia. "Gendering Representation in Spain: Opportunities and Limits of Gender Quotas" Journal of Women, Politics & Policy 31.2 (2010). 23 Mar. 2011</ref> This law is unique in that surpasses the 40% parity figure established by the European Commission in 1998; a figure which (according to the EC) indicates <U+201C>parity democracy.<U+201D> Though there is anecdotal of increasing female representation on a local and national level, there has not yet been national-level data to quantitatively bolster this assertion.

==Comparing women's integration into branches of government==
===Executive branch===
Women have been notably underrepresented in the executive branch of government.  The gender gap has been closing, however, albeit slowly <ref name="Social Development 2005"/> The first women other than monarchs to hold head of state positions were in socialist countries. The first was [[Khertek Anchimaa-Toka]] of the [[Tuvan People's Republic]] from 1940<U+2013>1944, followed by [[S<U+00FC>khbaataryn Yanjmaa]] of the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] 1953-1954 and [[Soong Ching-ling]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] from 1968<U+2013>1972 and 1981.

Following the socialist countries, the Nordic countries have been forerunners in including women in the executive branch. The [[second cabinet Brundtland]] (1986<U+2013>1989) was historical in that 8 out of 18 cabinet members were women, and in 2007 the [[second cabinet Stoltenberg]] (2005<U+2013>present) was more than 50% women. Some current female politicians that have reached top positions in the Nordic countries are the President of [[Finland]], [[Tarja Halonen]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden]], [[Maud Olofsson]].

In 2003, Finland had a historical moment when all top leaders of the country were women and also represented different political parties: [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social democrat]] [[Tarja Halonen]] was President, [[Riitta Uosukainen]] from [[National Coalition Party]] was [[Speaker of the Parliament of Finland|Speaker of the Parliament]] and after the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2003|parliamentary elections of 2003]] [[Anneli J<U+00E4><U+00E4>tteenm<U+00E4>ki]] from [[Centre Party (Finland)|Center party]] was on her way to become the first female [[Prime Minister of Finland]]. By June 22, 2010 [[Mari Kiviniemi]] of the Centre Party was appointed the second female [[Prime Minister of Finland]].

The world's first elected [[List of elected or appointed female heads of state|female president]] was [[Vigd<U+00ED>s Finnbogad<U+00F3>ttir]] of [[Iceland]], whose term lasted from 1980 to 1996.

In 2005, [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] of [[Liberia]] became Africa's first elected female head of state.

===Legislative branch===
It was not until World War I and the first socialist revolutions that the first few women became members of governments. [[Alexandra Kollontai]] became the first female to hold a minister position, as the People's Commissar for Social Welfare in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] in 1917.<ref>http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/First-female-ministers.htm</ref> [[Nina Bang]], Danish Minister of Education from 1924<U+2013>26, was the world's second full female cabinet minister.

The first female head of government was [[Evgeniia Bosh]], the Bolshevik military leader who held the People's Secretary of Internal Affairs position in the Ukraine People's Republic of the Soviets of Workers and Peasants from 1917<U+2013>1918, which was responsible for executive functions.<ref>http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/Premier_Ministers.htm</ref><ref>http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Ukraine.html</ref><ref>http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/uk/publish/article?art_id=1261011&cat_id=661258</ref> Nevertheless, development was slow and it was not until the end of the 20th century that female ministers stopped being unusual.

The first government organization formed with the goal of women's equality was the [[Zhenotdel]], in Soviet Russia.

According to a 2006 report by the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]], 16% of all parliament members in the world are female. In 1995, the [[United Nations]] set a goal of 30% female representation.<ref name="2006report">{{Cite news|author= |title=Women politicians 'making gains' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4758036.stm |work=BBC News |date=28 February 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-18 }}</ref> The current annual growth rate of women in national parliaments is about 0.5% worldwide. At this rate, gender parity in national legislatures will not be achieved until 2068.<ref name="unicef.org"/>

The top ten countries in terms of number of female parliamentary members are [[Rwanda]] with 56.3%, [[Sweden]] (47.0%), [[Cuba]] (43.2%), [[Finland]] (41.5%), [[the Netherlands]] (41.3%), [[Argentina]] (40.0%), [[Denmark]] (38.0%), [[Angola]] (37.3%), [[Costa Rica]] (36.8%), [[Spain]] (36.3%)<ref>[http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/arc/classif301108.htm]</ref>. Cuba has the highest percentage for countries without a quota. In South Asia, Nepal is highest in the rank of women participation in politics with (33%)<ref>[http://www.sapint.org/]</ref>. In the United States in 2008, the [[New Hampshire State Senate]] became the first state legislature upper house to possess an elected female majority.

The United Kingdom and United States are roughly in line with the world average. The [[House of Lords]] has 139 women (19.7%), while there are [[Women in the British House of Commons|125 women]] (19.4%) in the [[British House of Commons]].

===Local representation===
There has been an increasing focus on women<U+2019>s representation at a local level.<ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003"/>  Most of this research is focused on developing countries.  Governmental decentralization often results in local government structures that are more open to the participation of women, both as elected local councilors and as the clients of local government services.<ref name="Social Development 2005"/>
A 2003 survey conducted by United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), a global network supporting inclusive local governments, found that the average proportion of women in local council was 15%.  In leadership positions, the proportion of women was lower: for instance, 5% of mayors of Latin American municipalities are women.

According to a comparative study of women in local governments in East Asia and the Pacific, women have been more successful in reaching decision-making position in local governments than at the national level.<ref name="unicef.org"/>  Local governments tend to be more accessible and have more available positions.  Also, women<U+2019>s role in local governments may be more accepted because they are seen as an extension of their involvement in the community.

====Indian panchayats====
The local panchayat system in India provides an example of women<U+2019>s representation at the local governmental level.<ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003"/> The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments in 1992 mandated panchayat elections throughout the country.  The reforms reserved 33% of the seats for women and for castes and tribes proportional to their population.  Over 700,000 women were elected after the reforms were implemented in April 1993.
