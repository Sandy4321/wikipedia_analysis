'''Erie''' ([[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] {{IPA|<U+02C8>i.<U+0279>i}}) is a major industrial city on the shore of [[Lake Erie]] in the northwestern corner of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. Named for the lake and the [[Erie tribe|Native American tribe]] that resided along its southern shore, Erie is the state's fourth-largest [[city]] with a population of 104,000.<ref name="county facts">{{cite web|publisher=Erie County Government|url=http://www.eriecountygov.org/default.aspx?id=rec&HeadlineID=394298488593750&Action=ShowArticle|title=Interesting Facts about Erie County|accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> Erie's Metropolitan Area consists of 281,000 residents. The city is the seat of government for [[Erie County, Pennsylvania|Erie County]].

Erie is centrally located between [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]; [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York]]; and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Once swarming with heavy industry, Erie's heavy manufacturing sector now consists mainly of plastics and locomotive building. Known for its [[lake effect snow]], Erie is in the heart of the [[rust belt]]. The city has begun to focus on tourism as a driving force in its economy. Annually over four million people go to swim, hike, and fish at [[Presque Isle State Park]],<ref name="bob">{{cite web|publisher=Pennsylvania DCNR|url=http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/STATEPARKS/parks/presqueisle.aspx|title=Presque Isle State Park|accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> while a [[Presque Isle Downs|new casino]] named for the state park is growing in popularity.

Erie is known as the ''Flagship City'' because of the presence of [[Oliver Hazard Perry]]'s flagship [[U.S. Brig Niagara (replica)|''Niagara'']].<ref name="city facts">{{cite web|publisher=The City of Erie|url=http://www.erie.pa.us/AboutErie/Facts/tabid/80/Default.aspx|title=About Erie&mdash;Facts|accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> Erie has also been called the ''Gem City'' because of the sparkling lake.<ref name="city facts"/>

== History ==
{{main|History of Erie, Pennsylvania}}
The [[Iroquois|Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy]] and the [[Seneca Nation]] occupied the lands now known as Erie. The French built [[Fort Presque Isle]] near present day Erie in 1753, as part of their effort to garrison New France against the encroaching English. The French word "[[Presque-isle]]" means peninsula (literally "almost an island") and refers to that piece of land that juts into Lake Erie that is now called [[Presque Isle State Park]]. When the fort was abandoned by the French in 1760, it was their last post west of Niagara. The British occupied the fort at Presque Isle that same year, three years before the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763.<ref>''History of Erie County, Pennsylvania, Vol I'' (1884:Warner, Beer's and Company, Chicago), pg 503</ref>

[[Image:Niagara small.jpg|thumb|left|The brig ''[[U.S. Brig Niagara (replica)|Niagara]]'' played an important role in the history of  Erie.]]
Present day Erie would have been situated in a disputed [[Erie Triangle|triangle]] of land that was claimed by the states of [[New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Connecticut]] (as part of its [[Connecticut Western Reserve|Western Reserve]]), and [[Massachusetts]]. It officially became part of Pennsylvania on [[March 3]], [[1792]], after Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York released their claims to the federal government, which in turn sold the land to Pennsylvania for [[United States dollar|$]]151.6 million in [[Continental (currency)|Continental certificates]]. The [[Iroquois|Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy]] released the land to Pennsylvania in January 1789 for payments of $2,000 from Pennsylvania and $1,200 from the federal government. The [[Seneca Nation]] separately settled land claims against Pennsylvania in February 1791 for the sum of $800.<ref name="sex">''Nelson's Biographical Dictionary and Historical Reference Book of Erie County, Pennsylvania, Vol I'', pp 103&ndash;04</ref> 

The General Assembly of Pennsylvania commissioned the surveying of land near Presque Isle through an act passed on [[April 18]], [[1795]]. [[Andrew Ellicott]], who famously completed [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]]'s survey of [[Washington, D.C.]] and helped resolve the boundary between Pennsylvania and New York, arrived to begin the survey in June 1795. Initial settlement of the area began that year.<ref name="sex"/><ref>''History of Erie County, Pennsylvania, Vol I'' (1884:Warner, Beer's and Company, Chicago), pg 505&ndash;06</ref>
[[Image:662006erie-1922.jpg|thumb|right|A street in downtown Erie in the early [[1920's]]]]
In order to wrest control of Lake Erie from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] during the [[War of 1812]], President [[James Madison]] ordered the construction of a naval fleet at Erie. Noted shipbuilders Daniel Dobbins of Erie and Noah Brown of New York led construction of four schooner&ndash;rigged gunboats and two brigs. Commodore [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] arrived from Rhode Island and led the squadron to success in the historic [[Battle of Lake Erie]].<ref>{{citeweb|publisher=Flagship Niagara League|url=http://www.brigniagara.org/battle.htm|title=Niagara History&ndash;Battle of Lake Erie|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref>

Erie was an important railroad hub in the mid&ndash;nineteenth century, the city being the site where three sets of [[rail gauge|track gauges]] met. While the delays required to unload and load passengers and cargo were a problem for commerce and travel, they provided much needed local jobs in Erie. When a national [[standard gauge|standardized gauge]] was proposed, those jobs, and the importance of the rail hub itself, were put in jeopardy. The citizens of Erie, led by the mayor, set fire to bridges, ripped up track, and rioted to stop standardization.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.railroad.net/articles/columns/history/gauges/index.php|last=Shapiro| first=Carl|publisher=History in Motion|title=Railroad Guages (sic): A Standards Battle|accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> 

On [[August 5]], [[1915]], the Mill Creek (the creek that [[Millcreek Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania|Millcreek Township]] was named after) [[flood|flooded]] downtown Erie when a [[culvert]] blocked by debris, gave out.<ref name="hanna">{{citeweb|publisher=Erie County Historical Society|url=http://www.eriecountyhistory.org/GlobalPages/Photo4/LlbPhoto.html|title=Mill Creek Flood|accessdate=2007-06-22}}</ref> A four block reservoir, caused by torrential [[downpour]]s,  had formed behind it.

Erie's importance gradually faded thought the 1900's as the age of lake trade and commercial fishing began to end.<ref name="mary">{{citeweb|publisher=City-data.com|url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Northeast/Erie-History.html|title=Erie Detailed History|accessdate=2007-06-22}}</ref> Downtown Erie continued to grow for most of the [[20th century]], before taking a major population downturn in the [[1970]]'s.<ref name="mary"/> With the advent of motor vehicle's, [[urban sprawl]] has started a exit of Erie into the suburbs, including [[Millcreek Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania|Millcreek Township]]; who now has over 50,000 people.<ref name="mary"/>

==Geography and cityscape==
[[Image:Bicentennial Tower.JPG|none|thumb|right|The [[Bicentennial Tower]] at the end of State Street on Dobbins Landing.]]
Erie is located at {{coor dms|42|6|52|N|80|4|34|W|city}} (42.114507, -80.076213){{GR|1}} in the [[Erie Triangle]]. Erie is on the south-central shores of Lake Erie, directly in between [[Cleveland]], [[OH]] and [[Buffalo, NY|Buffalo]], [[NY]]. Many streams and rivers bisect the city and surrounding areas, leading to the lake. 

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{sq mi to km2|28.0|wiki=yes}} with {{sq mi to km2|22.0}} of it being land and the remaing (21.54%) being water. Erie is home to [[Presque Isle State Park]] (known to the locals as "The Peninsula"), a [[peninsula]] that juts out into [[Lake Erie]] and has 7 miles of public beaches, wetlands, and fishing locations. 
[[Image:Erie, Pennsylvania map.png|thumb|left|A road map of Erie showing the major routes that travel through it.]]
Erie is laid out in a grid pattern, centering from [[Perry Square]] in the center of downtown.<ref name="emma">{{citeweb|publisher=Google Maps|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?client=firefox-a&hl=en&q=Erie,+PA&ie=UTF8&ll=42.165439,-80.085526&spn=0.191873,0.4422&z=11&iwloc=addr&om=1| title=Map of Erie, PA|accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref>The downtown buildings, although none of 20 stories, are separated from the waterfront by the Bayfront Parkway.<ref name="emma"/> Erie has generally small ethnic neighborhoods including Little Italy. South of 38th Street, the grid pattern gives way to curvilinear roads of post&ndash;1970 suburban development. [[Millcreek Township, PA|Millcreek Township]] and [[Peach Street]] are among Erie's newer areas.

Most of the cityscape includes abandoned factories, mid&ndash;rise housing, single family homes, as well as corporate  buildings. Eries waterfront includes the [[List of city parks of Erie, Pennsylvania|Pepsi Amphitheater]] and surrounding parkland, that hosts numerous festivals. The [[Bayfront Convention Center|Bayfront Convention Center and Hotel]] is on Sassafras Pier next to Dobbins Landing.<ref name="emma"/> The [[Bicentennial Tower]] dominates the city's skyline. On the east end of the waterfront, the [[Erie Maritime Museum]] and the city's main library host the [[U.S. Brig Niagara (replica)|Brig ''Niagara'']]. Docks and Marinas make up the distance between.

==Climate==
[[Image:Snowapril.jpg|thumb|right|Snow in April]]
The climate of Erie is typical of the Great Lakes. Winters are cold with lake effect snow; summer is hot and humid. On the [[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]], Erie is in the warm summer humid continental climate zone (Dfa). The city experiences a full range of weather events, including snow, ice, rain, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and fog.

{{main|Economy of Erie, Pennsylvania}}
[[Image:Eriefactory01.jpg|thumb|right|Old factory in Erie]]

Erie is the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's primary access point to [[Lake Erie]], the Great Lakes, and the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]]. The city emerged as a maritime center after the [[American Revolution]], then as a railroad hub during the great American westward expansion. Erie became an important city for iron and steel manufacturing during the [[Industrial Revolution]] and thrived well into the 20th century with big industry. 

While only electric [[locomotive]] building remains of the large manufacturers in the early 21st century, a more diverse mix of mid-sized industries has emerged. This broader economic base includes not only smaller and more agile steel and plastic plants, but also a vigorous service sector: health, insurance and tourism thrive in Erie. As of March 2007, Erie's unemployment rate was 4.1%, more than a point's improvement over the 5.2% rate a year earlier.<ref>{{cite web|first=Lou|last=Baxter|date=[[May 1]], [[2007]]|publisher=YourErie.com|url=http://www.wjettv.com/content/fulltext/?cid=2114|title=Erie Unemployment Falls |accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> The national unemployment rate was 4.4%.
