'''Kain''' is a [[fictional character]], and the main [[protagonist]] and [[titular character]] of the ''[[Legacy of Kain]]'' [[video game]] series. First introduced in ''[[Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain]]'' in 1996, he was created by [[Denis Dyack]] and [[Silicon Knights]], and has appeared in all subsequent ''Legacy of Kain'' games under the direction of developer [[Crystal Dynamics]]. Between games, he serves as either the central [[playable character]], or as an [[antagonist]], but in all his depictions he has consistently been described as an [[antihero]].

Drawing inspiration from the morally-ambiguous character of William Munny from [[Clint Eastwood]]'s 1992 [[film]] ''[[Unforgiven]]'', Silicon Knights conceived Kain as a nobleman murdered and revived as a [[vampire]] to take revenge on his assassins. He gradually embraces his new existence, and learns of his birthright to maintain balance in Nosgoth (the [[Setting (narrative)|fictional setting]] of the series). Crystal Dynamics later portrayed Kain as an [[Oedipus]]-like figure, seeking to thwart the fate determined for him before his birth.

Beyond his role in the series, Kain has also featured in tie-in comics, and in Crystal Dynamics' ''[[Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light]]''. In all of his [[voice acting|voiced]] appearances, he has been played by actor [[Simon Templeman]]. He has been favorably received by video game critics and enthusiasts, with praise attributed to his antagonistic role in ''[[Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver]]'', and his status as a strong example of a memorable, nuanced antihero in the medium.

==Concept and creation==
{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=Kain is very much the focus of the series, though. If you remove the melodrama and just look at the human elements of his character, you can see that he's flawed. Depending on how you look at things you could call him a tragic hero or an anti-hero. In my opinion, characters painted as 'true villains' just aren't interesting. They're too two-dimensional; no one is ever really so uncomplicated. Everyone always has their motives for what they're doing - everybody believes they're doing the right thing within their belief system. Kain is basically screwed by his own character flaws - which is more interesting than the idealized hero figure.|source=<U+2014>[[Amy Hennig]], ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'', September 2002<ref name="SR2-OPM"/>}}

Kain's character was originally conceived circa 1993 by [[Silicon Knights]]' president, [[Denis Dyack]], as the protagonist of ''The Pillars of Nosgoth'', an initial [[video game]] concept for what would become 1996's ''[[Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain]]''. He was modeled in part on William Munny, the [[protagonist]] of [[Clint Eastwood]]'s 1992 [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[film]], ''[[Unforgiven]]''.<ref name="BO1-SK-1">{{cite web |title=SK: The Complete Guide To Legacy of Kain - Behind The Scenes |publisher=[[Silicon Knights]] |url=http://www.dark-chronicle.co.uk/resources/bo1_faq/faqbehin.htm |date= January 13, 1997 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref> The developers set out to craft an [[antihero]] to suit "a game where the player is put in the position where everyone believes you are evil", feeling that the industry required a story addressing issues of moral ambiguity and wondering how players would react when "everyone in the world was your enemy (including yourself) [...] where you had to kill innocents to survive [and] you are the ultimate pawn".<ref name="BO1-SK-1"/><ref name="BO1-SK-2">{{cite web |title=Recreated PSXnation.com Interview with Denis Dyack |publisher=psxnation.com |url=http://nosgoth.net/Blood_Omen/PSNinterview1.htm |accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref> Other influences which helped to define Kain's character arc included ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'', ''[[Necroscope]]'', and cover art from ''[[The Pillars of the Earth]]''.<ref name="BO1-SK-1"/> In comparison to [[Count Dracula]], Dyack commented in an interview that he believed Kain would "kick his ass" in a fight. He and writer Ken McCulloch considered [[Simon Templeman]]'s voiceover for the character superlative, despite initial apprehensions that the actors they had hired might not be able to convey the game's complicated dialogue.<ref name="BO1-SK-2"/>

In this game, which built upon the ''Blood Omen'' [[Types of fiction with multiple endings|ending]] in which he damns the world, Kain adopted the role of [[antagonist]], with new character [[Raziel (Legacy of Kain)|Raziel]] serving as the lead. Hennig justified this choice, believing that it would prove interesting to see what his decision had engendered after a few millennia. She emphasized, though, that she did not consider him a monster or mustache-twirling villain, remarking that "in many ways, he's a more complex and sympathetic character than Raziel himself".<ref name="Kain-Hennig">{{cite journal |date=September 1999 |title=Face To Face: Demon Meet Your Maker |work=[[Game Informer]]}}</ref> Sources which helped to formulate his role in the plot ranged from [[Bible|Biblical]] lore to [[Eastern world|Eastern]] myth and [[mysticism]].<ref name="SR1-Inspirations">{{cite web |first=Craig |last=Hansen |title=Interview: Soul Reaver's Amy Hennig |publisher=GamerWeb Sega |url=http://sega.gamerweb.com/features/srint.asp |date=January, 2000 |accessdate=2012-10-31  |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030325071423/http://sega.gamerweb.com/features/srint.asp |archivedate=2003-03-25}}</ref>

No longer acting as a pure villain, Kain was intended to function as a "steadfast character", coming to the story from a position of knowledge in contrast to Raziel's relative ignorance. Hennig expressed that, by ''Soul Reaver 2'', her personal perception of Kain's character had changed over the years, and that she now considered him a somewhat more attractive and interesting individual than Raziel due to his complexity. She dubbed him a [[tragic hero]], "screwed by his own character flaws", and argued that this [[hamartia]] added to his depth.<ref name="SR2-OPM">{{cite journal |first1=John |last1=Davison |first2=Joe |last2=Rybicki |date=September 2000 |title=[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]] |issue=36}}</ref> Since joining [[Naughty Dog]], when asked whether Raziel or Kain is closest to her heart, Hennig has said that while Raziel is a sympathetic protagonist, she probably prefers Kain as a character.<ref name="BtC-SR1">{{cite web |first=Sid |last=Shuman |title=Behind the Classics: Amy Hennig Talks Soul Reaver Secrets |publisher=[[PlayStation Network|PlayStation Blog]] |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/10/12/behind-the-classics-amy-hennig-talks-soul-reaver-secrets/ |date=October 12, 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref>

''[[Legacy of Kain: Defiance]]'', released in 2003, returned to the aged, elder Kain from ''Soul Reaver'' and ''Soul Reaver 2'', now controllable alongside Raziel.

==Characteristics==
Kain's appearance undergoes "pretty dramatic changes" throughout the games as he ages,<ref name="Defiance-Kyle"/> but core personality attributes cited by ''Defiance'''s developers include his intelligence and cynicism,<ref name="Defiance-Richard"/> arrogance and regality,<ref name="Defiance-Richard"/><ref name="SR1-Kain-Symbol">{{cite web |first=Daniel |last=Cabuco |title=Kain's symbol |publisher=The Art of Daniel Cabuco |url=http://spectraljin.com/Soul%20Reaver/SR1_misc/Kain%20symbol.htm |accessdate=2012-10-22 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101003054353/http://www.spectraljin.com/Soul%20Reaver/SR1_misc/Kain%20symbol.htm |archivedate=2010-10-03}}</ref> and his defiant nature.<ref name="IGN-LitMyth"/> In the series' fictional universe, he is described as the guardian of balance, a being responsible for preserving the health and integrity of Nosgoth (the games' setting), but left incapable of realizing this duty due to spiritual corruption he inherited at birth.<ref name="Defiance-Kyle"/>

The character's transformation into a vampire, and the visceral nature this trait lends the series, was derived from [[William Shakespeare]]'s classical models: "for the drunken commoners in the front rows he would insert dirty jokes to keep them entertained but for the aristocracy in the balconies he would write very cerebral metaphors". According to Silicon Knights, the gore and vampirism in ''Blood Omen'' served as their "dirty jokes", supplemented by a complex story.<ref name="BO1-SK-2"/>

As the story progresses, Kain evolves from a directionless young nobleman, to a lithe and devious vampire, to a "craggy" figure.<ref name="Defiance-Richard"/><ref name="Defiance-Kyle"/> As a playable character, he frequently narrates his thoughts through the dramatic device of [[soliloquy]]. In ''Blood Omen'' and ''Defiance'', his [[battle cry]] and [[catchphrase]] is [[Vae victis]], a [[Latin]] phrase attributed to [[Brennus]] meaning "woe to the conquered".<ref name="VaeVictus">{{cite web |title=Gallic Sack of Rome |publisher=UNRV.com |url=http://www.unrv.com/empire/gallic-sack-of-rome.php/ |accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref>

In ''Soul Reaver 2'', Kain acts as a [[non-player character]] encountered by Raziel in several cutscenes. As the game's plot progresses, his agenda and motives become clearer. He seeks a third option to the dilemma prescribed for him at the end of ''Blood Omen'',<ref name="Dilemma"/> hoping to both restore Nosgoth and return the Pillars to vampire control.<ref>'''Raziel:''' We agree then that the Pillars are crucial, and must be restored? / '''Kain:''' Yes, Raziel <U+2013> that's why we've come full-circle to this place. / '''Raziel:''' So after all this you make my case for me. To end this stalemate, you must die so that new Guardians can be born. / '''Kain:''' The Pillars don't belong to them, Raziel... they belong to us. / '''Raziel:''' Your arrogance is boundless, Kain. / '''Kain:''' There's a third option <U+2013> a monumental secret, hidden in your very presence here.

''Blood Omen 2'' pursues a younger Kain during his early conquests of Nosgoth,<ref name="Defiance-Richard"/> in the altered timeline triggered by the changes to Raziel's destiny at the end of ''Soul Reaver 2''.<ref name="Defiance-Q&A-AH">{{cite web |first=Amy |last=Hennig |authorlink=Amy Hennig |title=Question and Answer with Amy Hennig |publisher=The Lost Worlds |url=http://www.thelostworlds.net/Defiance/Question_and_Answer_with_Amy_Hennig.html |accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref> ''Legacy of Kain: Defiance'' takes place in the same altered timeline, periodically switching between the characters of the elder Kain and Raziel from ''Soul Reaver 2'', with both acting as playable protagonists. Over the course of the game, Moebius manipulates Kain into believing he is a champion prophesied to fight against and destroy Raziel,<ref>'''Kain:''' Here, no doubt, was the evidence Moebius wished me to have... For the Vampires had prophesied not one, but two champions <U+2013> one destined to be Nosgoth's redeemer, the other, its destroyer. The Vampires' hero wielded the Reaver, forged for this very purpose. His opponent was clearly the hero of their adversaries <U+2013> the Hylden <U+2013> and brandished a flaming sword. The foretold outcome was unambiguous: the Vampire hero would fall. {{cite video game |title=Legacy of Kain: Defiance |developer=Crystal Dynamics |publisher=Eidos Interactive |date=November 11, 2003 |platform=PlayStation 2}}</ref> culminating in a final battle between the two characters which Raziel wins.<ref>'''Raziel:''' And will that knowledge sustain you?

Which hero do you think you are now? The vampire savior? Or the other one? Have you realized yet that it didn't matter to us which one either of you thought you were, so long as the result was the same in the end? And now, Kain is dead. Really, I cannot thank you enough. {{cite video game |title=Legacy of Kain: Defiance |developer=Crystal Dynamics |publisher=Eidos Interactive |date=November 11, 2003 |platform=PlayStation 2}}</ref> It is discovered that The Elder God is malevolent, and he and Moebius<U+2014>his servant<U+2014>had conspired against Kain from the outset of the series, considering vampires an abomination.<ref>'''Kain:''' This history, in part, I knew already... How, as the Vampires began to die out, the Pillars summoned human Guardians to fulfill their roles. It seemed the ancient Vampires had adopted <U+2013> and, when necessary, abducted <U+2013> the human Guardians, and made vampires of them when they came of age. Until the humans rebelled against their masters... And here I made a surprising discovery: it was Moebius the Time Streamer, and Mortanius, Guardian of Death, who led the bloody revolt. Now I understood why Moebius hated me so intensely. I was the first vampire Guardian in all these centuries <U+2013> and he knew what my coming signified... or perhaps I reminded him of all he had forsaken. {{cite video game |title=Legacy of Kain: Defiance |developer=Crystal Dynamics |publisher=Eidos Interactive |date=November 11, 2003 |platform=PlayStation 2}}</ref><ref>'''Raziel:''' I had seen this symbol throughout these ruins.

Finally I understood <U+2013> it was not their blood-thirst, but their immortality that was the true nature of their enemies' curse. The wisest, strongest, most noble race <U+2013> gulled by the voice of that old parasite.

Opinion on Kain's character has been largely positive in critical reviews of the ''Legacy of Kain'' games. Praise has frequently been directed towards Simon Templeman's voice acting, with [[IGN]], [[Game Revolution]] and Adrenaline Vault citing Kain's soliloquies as "both gruesome and entertaining", "the best part [of the game's audio]" and "one of the best stints of voice acting ever recorded" respectively in their assessments of his debut in the original ''Blood Omen''.<ref name="BO1-IGN">{{cite web |title=Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain - PlayStation Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/152/152024p1.html |date=January 31, 1997 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref><ref name="BO1-GR">{{cite web |first=Baldric |title=Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain Review |publisher=[[Game Revolution]] |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/blood-omen-legacy-of-kain |date=December 5, 1996 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref><ref name="SR2-AV">{{cite web |first=Mike |last=Laidlaw |title=Soul Reaver 2 |publisher=Adrenaline Vault |url=http://avault.com/consoles/reviews/ps2/review_temp.asp?game=soulr2&page=3 |date=May 3, 2002 |accessdate=2012-10-22 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030608053041/http://avault.com/consoles/reviews/ps2/review_temp.asp?game=soulr2&page=3 |archivedate=2003-06-08}}</ref> For ''Blood Omen 2'', although critics expressed disappointment with the game itself, they praised Kain's character nevertheless; [[GameSpot]]'s [[Greg Kasavin]] branded him "a very intriguing protagonist" and "as memorable of a main character as they come",<ref name="BO2-GS-PS2">{{cite web |first=Greg |last=Kasavin |authorlink=Greg Kasavin |title=Blood Omen 2 Review (PlayStation 2) |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |url=http://gamespot.com/blood-omen-2/reviews/blood-omen-2-review-playstation-2-2858657/ |date=March 27, 2002 |accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref> while IGN's [[Douglass C.
