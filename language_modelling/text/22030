{{2010 Big Ten football standings}}

The '''2010 Michigan Wolverines football team''' represented the [[University of Michigan]] in the [[2010 NCAA Division I FBS football season]]. They played their home games at [[Michigan Stadium]] in [[Ann Arbor|Ann Arbor, Michigan]] and competed in the [[Big Ten Conference]]. The season was the first since the renovation of Michigan Stadium, begun in 2007, was completed. The Wolverines were led by third-year head coach [[Rich Rodriguez]]. After their week 10 win against Illinois, Michigan became bowl eligible for the first time since [[2007 Michigan Wolverines football team|2007]], and they later accepted a bid to play in the [[2011 Gator Bowl|Gator Bowl]] against [[2010 Mississippi State Bulldogs football team|Mississippi State]] on January 1, 2011, losing 52&ndash;14. The Wolverines finished the season sixth out of 120 [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] teams in [[total offense]], 110th in total defense and 112th in passing defense. Michigan finished with an overall record of 7<U+2013>6, 3<U+2013>5 in Big Ten play. After the season, head coach Rich Rodriguez and his staff were dismissed on January 5, 2011.

Several individual players had standout performances. [[Quarterback]] [[Denard Robinson]] set several school records, became the first quarterback in college football history to rush and pass for 1,500 yards, and finished sixth in [[Heisman Trophy]] voting. He surpassed [[Drew Brees]]' single-season Big Ten Conference total offense record and the FBS single-season quarterback rushing record. He also won the [[2010 Big Ten Conference football season|2010 Big Ten]] rushing title, the [[Chicago Tribune Silver Football]] for being the Big Ten's Most Valuable Player, and was named the [[Big Ten Conference football individual honors#Offensive_Player_of_the_Year|Big Ten's Offensive Player of the Year]]. 

[[Jonas Mouton]] was the Big Ten's statistical champion in tackles, while [[Jordan Kovacs]] finished second. In conference games alone, [[Roy Roundtree]] led the conference in receiving yards per game, in part on the strength of a school single-game record 246-yard outing against [[2010 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]]. Reserve quarterback [[Tate Forcier]] also set a school single-game [[completion percentage]] record with a 12-for-12 performance against [[2010 Bowling Green Falcons football team|Bowling Green]]. The defense also set several records, including most points allowed and yards allowed.

==Preseason==
In [[2009 Michigan Wolverines football team|2009]], the Wolverines started out 4-0, but finished the season 5-7 and missed a [[bowl game]] for the second year in a row.<ref name=MWFP>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegesports-fans.com/football-previews/2010-preview/michigan-wolverines-preview.html|title=2010 Michigan Wolverines Football Preview|accessdate=2010-11-11|publisher=CollegeSports-fans.com|author=Baxendell, Max}}</ref> Michigan finished the season seventh in the Big Ten in total offense and ninth in total defense.<ref>{{cite web|title=2009 Michigan Football Ranking Summary|publisher=NCAA|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/football/exec/rankingSummary?year=2009&org=418|accessdate=2010-11-11}}</ref>

The team entered the season surrounded by questions of how they would overcome the late season collapse from last year and what it would take for Rich Rodriguez to return for a fourth year.<ref name=MWFP/> On January 5, Michigan hired [[David Brandon]] to replace [[William C.

Following their win against Connecticut, the Wolverines traveled to [[South Bend, Indiana]] to take on their long-time rivals, the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame Fighting Irish]], in their first road game of the season. Michigan won the previous year's contest on a Tate Forcier to [[Greg Mathews (American football)|Greg Mathews]] touchdown pass with 11 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=292550130|title=Forcier's TD pass in final seconds seals Michigan's upset of Irish|accessdate=2010-11-19|date=2009-09-12|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}</ref> The game was seen as a crucial test to Michigan's season, as it was Michigan's first game in a hostile environment.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael Rosenberg|title=Notre Dame will reveal Michigan's, Michigan State's true colors|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=2010-11-29|date=2010-09-06|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20100906/COL22/9060367/Notre-Dame-will-reveal-Michigan-s-Michigan-State-s-true-colors}}</ref>

Notre Dame began the scoring early in the first quarter with a 1-yard touchdown run by quarterback [[Dayne Crist]]; however, Crist suffered a concussion during the opening drive and was forced to miss the remainder of the first half. Michigan responded with three unanswered touchdowns. First was a 31-yard reception by Roy Roundtree midway through the first quarter, then a 1-yard run by [[Stephen Hopkins (American football)|Stephen Hopkins]] near the end of the first, and later an 87-yard run by QB Denard Robinson, the longest in Notre Dame Stadium history. After halftime, the Fighting Irish responded with two touchdowns and a field goal. First was a 53-yard pass to [[TJ Jones]], followed by a 24-yard field goal by [[David Ruffer]]. Next was a 95-yard catch by [[Kyle Rudolph]], which put Notre Dame ahead late in the game. Michigan retook the lead with 27 seconds left with a 2-yard run by Denard Robinson. Michigan's defense held off Notre Dame on its final drive of the game, with Crist's final pass sailing over everyone and out of the end zone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Recap Week 2 Michigan at Notre Dame|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=302540087|date=2010-09-11|accessdate=2010-09-11|publisher=ESPN.com}}</ref>

Denard Robinson set a school record for total offense at 502 total yards - 258 rushing, 244 passing. The rushing yards set a new high for yards on the ground in one game by a Big Ten quarterback, as Robinson broke the league record of 217 yards set by Mike Kafka at Minnesota on November 1, 2008. Robinson became the ninth quarterback in NCAA history to rush and pass for 200 yards or more in a game, the last being West Virginia's Pat White against Pittsburgh on November 16, 2006 (220 rushing and 204 passing).  The last 200-yard rusher for Michigan was Mike Hart, who had 215 yards against Eastern Michigan on October 6, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/091110aac.html|title=Postgame Notes: Michigan 28, Notre Dame 24|date=2010-09-11|accessdate=2010-09-11|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=MGoBlue.com}}</ref>

After their dramatic win in South Bend against Notre Dame, Michigan played the [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Championship Subdivision|Division I FCS]] [[UMass Minutemen football|Massachusetts Minutemen]] (UMass) in Ann Arbor, the first ever meeting between the two teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/091810aac.html|title=Games Notes - Massachusetts at Michigan|date=2010-09-18|accessdate=2010-09-18|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=MGoBlue.com}}</ref> Michigan sought to avoid an upset similar to the 2007 team, which lost to [[Appalachian State Mountaineers football|Appalachian State]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Tim Rohan|title=Robinson, Wolverines try to avoid letdown against UMass|newspaper=The Michigan Daily|accessdate=2010-11-29|date=2010-09-16|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/robinson-wolverines-try-avoid-letdown-against-umass}}</ref>

The game proved to be much closer than expected, and much more similar to the [[2007 Appalachian State vs. Michigan football game|upset of 2007]] than Michigan desired. On the opening drive, UMass drove to the Michigan 12-yard line, but was forced to settle for a 29-yard field goal. On Michigan's first possession, Denard Robinson threw an interception on the second play (and first pass) of the drive. After a defensive stop, Michigan drove 93 yards for a touchdown on a drive that featured passes of 16 yards to [[Martavious Odoms]] and 43 yards to [[Kelvin Grady]].

On Michigan's first possession of the fourth quarter, Shaw led the way with a 50-yard run and a 4-yard touchdown run to put Michigan ahead 42-24. UMass responded with its second touchdown of the quarter on a five-yard pass from Havens to Julian Talley, but missed on the two-point conversion attempt. After a three-and-out by Michigan, UMass blocked Michigan's punt and drove for its third fourth-quarter touchdown aided by a pass interference penalty against Michigan's James Rogers. With 2:05 left to play, and Michigan leading 42-37, UMass attempted an onside kick that went out of bounds at the 40-yard line, allowing Michigan to run out the clock for the win.<ref>{{cite web|title=Michigan holds on as Denard Robinson accounts for 345 yards, 3 TDs|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2010-09-18|accessdate=2011-02-01|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=302610130}}</ref>

Following their close win against UMass, Michigan hosted the [[Bowling Green Falcons football|Bowling Green Falcons]]. This was the first meeting between the schools since 2000, which saw Michigan emerge victorious 42-7.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/preview?gid=201009250029|title=Bowling Green (1-2) at Michigan (3-0)|accessdate=2010-11-29|date=2010-09-21|publisher=[[Rivals]]}}</ref>

After the opening kickoff, Michigan drove 80 yards for a touchdown on a 2-yard run by quarterback Denard Robinson.

To open Big Ten play, Michigan traveled to [[Bloomington, Indiana]] for a shootout with the [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana Hoosiers]].

After the opening kickoff, Chappell led the Hoosiers on a six-minute, 77-yard drive capped by a 5-yard touchdown pass to [[Duwyce Wilson]]. Michigan responded less than a minute later on its second play from scrimmage with a 72-yard touchdown run by Denard Robinson. On its second possession, Robinson led an 85-yard drive concluding with a 32-yard touchdown pass to Roy Roundtree. On Michigan's third possession of the first quarter, Robinson completed a 74-yard pass to Roundtree who was tackled at the 1-yard line. However, Robinson fumbled the snap and the ball was recovered by Indiana.  Following the fumble, Chappell led Indiana on a five-minute, 99-yard touchdown drive capped by a 22-yard touchdown run by [[Darius Willis]].

The score remained 35-28 until the closing minutes as the defensive units held the offenses without a score for more than 20 minutes. Late in the fourth quarter, Chappell led Indiana on a six-minute, 80-yard drive. On fourth down with 1:20 remaining in the game, Chappell completed a 19-yard touchdown to Darius Willis to tie the game at 35-35.

In week 6, Michigan hosted their in-state rivals, the [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State Spartans]], for the coveted [[Paul Bunyan Trophy]]. This game was the 103rd edition of the rivalry. The game marked the first time since 1999 where both teams entered the game undefeated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Michigan St.-Michigan Preview|date=2010-10-09|accessdate=2010-12-14|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/preview?gameId=302820130|publisher=ESPN.com}}</ref> Expectations ran high for both teams, as Michigan State came into the game ranked 17th in the AP Poll and 16th in the Coaches Poll, while Michigan entered ranked 18th in the AP Poll and 17th in the Coaches Poll. Michigan State was victorious in the previous meeting in the series, winning 26-20 in overtime after a 23-yard touchdown run by Larry Caper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=292760127&period=0|title=(22) Michigan 20, Michigan State 26: Complete Play-by-Play|accessdate=2010-11-03|date=2009-10-03|work=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref>

Although Michigan was able to score first, it was Michigan State that dictated the pace of the game. After Michigan's 34-yard field goal, the only scoring in the first quarter, Michigan State responded with a 61-yard rushing touchdown by [[Edwin Baker (American football)|Edwin Baker]], which were the first points of the second quarter. Michigan took the lead a few minutes later with a 12-yard touchdown reception by Martell Webb, but the Spartans responded with a 41-yard rushing touchdown by [[Le'Veon Bell]], and later added to their lead with a 38-yard field goal by [[Dan Conroy]] just before halftime. State built on their lead in the third quarter with 2 touchdowns: first a 41-yard reception by [[Mark Dell]], then a 8-yard run by [[Larry Caper]]. Michigan's only points of the second half came on a 4-yard rushing touchdown by Denard Robinson. Michigan State sealed their win with a 28-yard field goal midway through the fourth quarter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=302820130|title=Michigan State Spartans at Michigan Wolverines Box Score|accessdate=2010-02-02|date=2010-10-09|work=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref>

Denard Robinson had perhaps his worst game up to this point in the season: he threw three interceptions and was held to only 84 yards rushing. This marked the first time that Michigan State had defeated Michigan three years in a row since they accomplished this feat from 1965-1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=302820130|title=Recap Week 6 Michigan State at Michigan|accessdate=2010-10-10|date=2010-10-09|work=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref> The announced crowd of 113,065 was, at the time, the second largest crowd ever at Michigan Stadium.

The previous year's contest saw Illinois emerge victorious, winning by a score of 38-13.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=293040356|title=Illinois breaks out with 500+ total yards against struggling Michigan|accessdate=2010-11-19|date=2009-10-31|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}</ref>

The game began with an auspicious start for Michigan, as they scored on the first play of the game from scrimmage with a 75-yard touchdown reception by Roy Roundtree. Illinois responded with two field goals by [[Derek Dimke]]: first from 43 yards, and then from 44 yards out.

Michigan tied it back up with a 4-yard run by Stephen Hopkins, and took the lead back with a 45-yard reception by Junior Hemingway. The first half ended with 2 field goals that left the game tied: a 35-yard Michigan field goal, and a 43-yard Illinois field goal. Contrary to the explosive nature of the first half, the third quarter was relatively quiet, with the only scoring being an 18-yard run by Michigan's Michael Shaw. The fourth quarter saw a reemergence of offense, as Illinois tied it back up with a 27-yard reception by Mikel Leshoure and then took the lead with a 1-yard run by Leshoure. Michigan was able to tie the game late with a 9-yard catch by Darryl Stonum. Illinois chose to run out the clock, taking it to overtime.

Michigan got the ball first to start the third overtime and scored on a 1-yard run by Michael Shaw. By rule, they had to go for a 2 point conversion, which they completed with a pass to Junior Hemingway. Illinois' Mikel Leshoure ran in a 3-yard touchdown, but their 2 point conversion failed, giving Michigan the win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=303100130|title=Illinois Fighting Illini vs. Michigan Wolverines Box Score|accessdate=2011-02-02|date=2010-11-06|work=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref>

The high scoring game set several school and conference records: the 132-point combined score was the highest-scoring game of the year in major college football (so far), and the highest in both the 131-year history of Michigan football and in the history of the Big Ten. The Illini's 65 points were the most ever allowed by Michigan. They also established Michigan records for combined points in a half (62) and combined points in a quarter (49). Michigan's previous records in those categories were: 130 points (vs. West Virginia, 1904), 55 points (vs. Chicago, 1939) and 39 points (vs. Penn State, 2005), respectively.

Michigan was never in contention during the game, as Michigan's offense was shut out in the first half, while Wisconsin's offense dominated Michigan's defense and jumped out to a 24-0 halftime lead. Wisconsin's only score of the first quarter was a 1-yard touchdown run by [[Montee Ball]]. In the second quarter, they added to their lead with a 25-yard field goal by [[Philip Welch]], a 27-yard touchdown run by Montee Ball, and a 61-yard run by [[James White (running back)|James White]].
