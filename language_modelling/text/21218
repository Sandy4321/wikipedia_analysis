'''James Evan Gattis''' (born August 18, 1986) is an American [[professional baseball]] player. He is currently a [[catcher]] and [[left fielder]] with the [[Atlanta Braves]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). He made his MLB debut with the Braves on April 3, 2013.

Gattis was a premier amateur baseball player in the [[Dallas<U+2013>Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas<U+2013>Fort Worth]] area through high school. However, anxiety and [[substance abuse]] led him to abandon his scholarship to [[Texas A&M University]]. After wandering around the [[Western United States]] for four years, he returned to baseball, and was drafted by the Braves in 2010.

After playing in [[minor league baseball]] for the Braves, Gattis made the team's [[Opening Day]] roster in 2013. Receiving playing time with [[Brian McCann (baseball)|Brian McCann]] on the [[disabled list]], Gattis won the [[National League Rookie of the Month Award]] for both April and May 2013. He became the Braves' primary catcher in 2014.

==Early life==
Gattis grew up in [[Forney, Texas]] and played baseball from the time he was six years old.<ref name=dallas/> His parents divorced when he was eight years old, and at the age of 12, he moved from his mother's house to live with his father's new family. Busy playing baseball, Gattis never processed his parents' divorce.<ref name=usatoday_profile/>

Gattis played for the [[Dallas]] Tigers, one of the premier amateur teams in the [[Dallas<U+2013>Fort Worth metroplex]].<ref name=dallas/> [[Clayton Kershaw]] was one of his teammates. He played on traveling [[All-Star]] teams with [[Austin Jackson]] and in the [[AAU Junior Olympic Games|Junior Olympic Games]] with [[Billy Butler (baseball)|Billy Butler]], [[Homer Bailey]], and [[Justin Upton]].<ref name=usatoday_profile>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/braves/2013/04/29/atlanta-braves-evan-gattis-improbable-path-to-majors/2122585/|title=Braves rookie: 'All I could think about was killing myself'|publisher=[[USA Today]]|first=Bob |last=Nightengale|date=April 30, 2013|accessdate=April 11, 2014}}</ref> He attended high schools in the Forney area, including [[R. L. Turner High School]], [[Forney High School]], and [[Bishop Lynch High School]], in order to play for specific [[coach (baseball)|coaches]].<ref name=dallas/>

Projected as a potential [[draft (sports)|draft pick]] in the first eight rounds of the [[2004 Major League Baseball Draft|2004 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft]], Gattis instead intimated that he intended to attend college and play [[college baseball]]. While [[Rice University]] offered him a [[scholarship]] to play [[first base]], he accepted an offer from [[Texas A&M University]], who wanted him to play as their [[catcher]].<ref name=usatoday_profile/><ref name=ajc/> However, the divorce of his parents and anxiety derived from the fear of failing at college baseball led Gattis into [[substance abuse]].<ref name=usatoday_profile/><ref name=ajc/> He went undrafted in the 2004 draft.<ref name=usatoday_profile/><ref name=nyt/>

Instead of going to college, Gattis' mother took him to a drug rehabilitation facility, where he had a 30-day inpatient stay. He then went to [[Prescott, Arizona]], where he had three months of outpatient therapy while living in a [[halfway house]].<ref name=usatoday_profile/><ref name=ajc>{{cite web|date=February 29, 2012 |first=David |last=O'Brien |url=http://blogs.ajc.com/atlanta-braves-blog/2012/02/29/braves-slugger-gattis-has-a-story-man-does-he-ever/ |title=Braves slugger Gattis has a story.

He sold his truck and worked in a pizza parlor and as a ski-lift operator at the [[Eldora Mountain Resort]].<ref name=ajc/>  Depressed, unable to sleep, and contemplating [[suicide]], Gattis entered an [[inpatient]] [[psychiatric ward]] for three days in the summer of 2007, where he was diagnosed with [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]] and an [[anxiety disorder]]. He was released into the care of his father.<ref name=usatoday_profile/>

After living in Colorado for seven months, Gattis moved to Dallas with his brother, where they worked as janitors for [[Datamatics Global Services]]. He met a [[New Age]] spiritual advisor there, and on her advice, he followed her to [[Taos, New Mexico]].<ref name=ajc/> There, he lived in a [[hostel]] and worked at a ski resort. Three months later, he moved to [[California]] to find more spiritual gurus.<ref name=ajc/> Gattis also moved to [[Wyoming]], where he worked at [[Yellowstone National Park]].<ref name=dallas/>
