'''Dwight Grant''' (born on [[March 6]], [[1974]]) better known as '''Beanie Sigel''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Muslim]]<ref>http://www.sohh.com/articles/article.php/6039</ref> [[rapping|rapper]] from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], signed to [[Damon Dash]] and [[Jay-Z]]'s [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] in [[1998]]. Beanie founded the group and label [[State Property]] as well as the clothing company.

Beanie Sigel's name derives from the street in Philadelphia where he was raised, Sigel Street, and "Beans" is what people used to call him as a child because he had a [[disposition]] towards [[flatulence]].  It is also a play on the name of the famous gangster, [[Bugsy Siegel]].

==Early career==
Sigel's debut LP, ''The Truth'', was released [[February 28]], [[2000]] on [[Roc-A-Fella Records]]. The album went gold with hits like "The Truth" and  "Remember The Days" featuring [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]]. His second album ''[[The Reason (2001 album)|The Reason]]'' was released in mid-2001. ''The Reason'' was lighter material compared to his debut album and introduced the world to his own rap group [[State Property]], a band of Philly rappers signed to the Roc.

==Feud==
Around [[2001]], Beanie Sigel and [[Jadakiss]] from the group [[D-Block]] (formerly known as ''The LOX'') were involved in an incident that stemmed from Jadakiss claiming rappers from Sigel's home city of [[Philadelphia]] got their style & flow from Jada. Sigel took offense to this, and they sent several tracks back and forth. Eventually [[Styles P]] (also from D-Block) and [[Jay-Z]] got involved. Sigel even called out [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]] (from the [[Ruff Ryders]] crew, to whom Jadakiss is affiliated), but received no response. Eventually Beanie Sigel, Jadakiss, and Styles P squashed their beef and performed together on Sheek Louch's album ''[[After Taxes]]'' on the song "Kiss Your Ass Goodbye".

The incident continued even after [[Russell Simmons]], owner at the time of [[Def Jam]] (the label which Jay-Z's [[Roc-A-Fella]] was under and Ruff Ryders was affiliated with through DMX) forced the two to declare a brief truce. Jay-Z apologized to Jadakiss and bowed out. Disses finally stopped flying after Sigel released a diss track over Jada's "Put Ya Hands Up" beat, recalling when the [[D-Block]] wore shiny suits in a [[Bad Boy]] video, among other things.

==Career since the split of [[Roc-A-Fella Records]]==
While he was in jail, it is said that none of the State Property members except for [[Oschino Vazquez]] came to visit him. He told Dame to pass the word on that State Property was no longer in effect, until after he was released. When the split between Roc-A-Fella owners occurred, Dame made it clear that Beanie's intentions were to move State Property to his new [[Dame Dash Music Group]].

However, all members except for the aforementioned Oschino, chose to go with Jay-Z. When questioned, they claimed they were signed by Jay and never needed State Property or Beanie Sigel to make them popular. When he was released from jail, Sigel had a few choice words for his friends, claiming "I still love them like brothers... I just don't know if we can make music again."

It was thought that Sigel had chosen to sign with Dame; however, this is unclear, as he was present at [[Jay-Z]]'s '''I Declare War''' concert in 2005.  He recently stated his next Def Jam release would be a mixtape, which would fulfill his contract with them.  He is currently working on his new album, [[Return of the Bad Guy]].

==Legal Trouble==
[[Image:Thebcoming.jpg|thumb|right|Beanie Sigel on the cover of "The B. Coming]]
In September, [[2005]], a jury acquitted him of charges that he nearly shot to death a man on a crowded city street two years prior. In August, Sigel left federal prison after serving nearly a year on a federal weapons charge that stemmed from a [[2002]] traffic stop in [[Philadelphia]].

Sigel also has fallen behind in child-support payments. He was briefly jailed in November until he paid $27,000 in child support and $2,000 in fines, but seems to be paying off his debts.

With the case behind him, Sigel now plans to "make music, make movies and work on his clothing line," said his attorney, [[Fortunato N. Perri Jr.]]  The case was the last in a series of criminal charges against Sigel, who has a long arrest record dating back to his days growing up in [[South Philadelphia]].

On Tuesday, [[January 10]], [[2006]], Sigel was convicted of assault for a fight in 2003. He agreed with the prosecutor's version of events, and was convicted of misdemeanor simple assault. He was immediately sentenced to two years probation plus $180 in court costs.

The charges stem from an argument between Sigel and a man who said the rapper punched him in both eyes, breaking his left eye socket, during a January 2003 argument outside a Chinese restaurant.

In Oct. [[2005]], his step-father, Sam Derry was murdered.

==Shooting==
On [[May 25]], [[2006]] shortly after 8:00 am, Sigel was shot twice in the upper right arm during a robbery attempt. He was hospitalized and is said to be in good condition.<ref>http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Music/05/25/music.beaniesigelshot.ap/index.html</ref>
According to Philly.com, sources at the [http://google-yahoo-buzz-index.blogspot.com/2006/05/google-news-buzz-police-doubt-beanie.html Philadelphia Police are skeptical] of the details of the shooting because no shell casings, or witnesses to the shooting have been located.
