The '''GT-1''' was an early form of [[guided missile|missile]] developed by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]]. Intended to deliver an [[aerial torpedo]] at a safe range from the launching aircraft, the weapon proved successful enough in testing to be approved for operational use, and the GT-1 saw limited use in the closing stages of the war.

==Design and development==
The GT-1 was derived from the [[Aeronca GB-1|GB-1]] series of glide bombs, developed by [[Aeronca]] for the United States Army Air Forces.<ref name="DS">Parsch 2003</ref> The weapon's airframe was inexpensive and simply designed, with a basic wing and twin tails attached to a cradle for carrying the payload.<ref name="DS"/> The GT-1 was unguided; the flight path of the glider was determined by a preset autopilot that kept the weapon on a steady course after release.<ref name="DS"/>

The GT-1 was usually released from its carrier aircraft at an altitude of {{convert|10000|ft}}; this provided a standoff range of as much as {{convert|25|mi}} under ideal conditions.<ref name="Esq">''[[Esquire Magazine|Esquire]]'' 1947; [http://books.google.com/books?ei=XdVJTfLFOsXpgQf19fEo&ct=result&id=QKE5AQAAIAAJ&dq=%22GT-1%22+glide+torpedo&q=%2225+miles%22#search_anchor Volume 28, p.70].</ref><ref name="ADPA"/> The GT-1's warload consisted of a [[Mark 13 torpedo|Mark 13 Mod 2A]] aerial torpedo. The GT-1 was fitted with a [[paravane]], trailing {{convert|20|ft}} below the main body of the craft; upon the paravane's striking the surface of the water, [[explosive bolt]]s would fire to release the torpedo, which would then execute a preset search pattern to locate and destroy its target.<ref name="DS"/><ref name="Esq"/>

==Operational history==
Initially tested during 1943,<ref name="DS"/><ref name="AAF"/> the GT-1 proved to be successful,<ref>Daso 1997, p.82.</ref> and was issued to operational units for service.<ref name="VS">Goebel 2010</ref> Launched from [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] bombers,<ref name="DS"/><ref name="Har">Hanle 2011</ref> the GT-1 saw brief operational service late in the war;<ref name="DS"/><ref name="AAF">Cate and Craven 1958, p.259.</ref> three missions are known to have been flown using the weapon from [[Okinawa]] in late 1945.<ref name="Har"/> On one mission eleven of thirteen GT-1s launched successfully entered the water; three hits were recorded.<ref name="Har"/>  The [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] was also capable of carrying the GT-1.<ref name="ADPA">''Army Ordnance'', Volume 30, 1946. American Defense Preparedness Association.

Following the end of World War Two, the aerial torpedo rapidly fell out of favor as a weapon of war, and the 'GT' category of weapons was abolished in 1947.<ref>Mann 2008, p.256.</ref>
