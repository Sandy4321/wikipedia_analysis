A '''cataract''' is an [[opacity]] that develops in the [[lens (anatomy)|crystalline lens]] of the [[eye]] or in its envelope. Early on in the development of age-related cataract the power of the crystalline lens may be increased, causing near-sightedness ([[myopia]]), and the gradual yellowing and opacification of the lens may reduce the perception of blue colours. Cataracts typically progress slowly to cause [[vision loss]] and are potentially [[blindness|blinding]] if untreated.<ref>http://www.aafp.org/afp/990700ap/99.html</ref> Moreover, with time the cataract cortex liquefies to form a milky white fluid in a '''Morgagnian Cataract''', and can cause severe inflammation if the lens capsule ruptures and leaks. Untreated, the cataract can cause [[glaucoma|phacomorphic glaucoma]]. Very advanced cataracts with weak zonules are liable to dislocation anteriorly or posteriorly.  Such spontaneous posterior dislocations (akin to the earliest surgical procedure of [[couching]]) in ancient times were regarded as a blessing from the heavens, because it restored some perception of light in the bilaterally affected patients. 

''Cataract'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''cataracta'' meaning "waterfall" and the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''kataraktes'' and ''katarrhaktes'', from ''katarassein'' meaning "to dash down" (''kata''-, "down"; ''arassein'', "to strike, dash"<ref>http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2003/10/29.html]</ref>). As rapidly running water turns white, the term may later have been used metaphorically to describe the similar appearance of mature ocular opacities. In Latin, ''cataracta'' had the alternate meaning, "[[portcullis]]"<ref>http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cataract</ref>, so it is also possible that the name came about through the sense of "obstruction".

[[Image:Human eyesight two children and ball with cataract.jpg|right|thumb|216px|Hazy view as seen by a person with a cataract, Courtesy NIH]]Cataracts develop from a variety of reasons, including long-term ultraviolet exposure, exposure to radiation, secondary effects of diseases such as [[diabetes]], and advanced age; they are usually a result of [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] of lens [[protein]]s. [[genetics|Genetic]] factors are often a cause of [[congenital]] cataracts and positive family history may also play a role in predisposing someone to cataracts at an earlier age, a phenomenon of "anticipation" in pre-senile cataracts. Cataracts may also be produced by [[eye injury]] or [[physical trauma]]. A study among [[Icelandair]] pilots showed commercial airline pilots as three times more likely to develop cataracts than people with non-flying jobs. This is thought to be caused by excessive exposure to radiation coming from [[outer space]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Rafnsson | first = V | coauthors = Olafsdottir E, Hrafnkelsson J, Sasaki H, Arnarsson A, Jonasson F | title = Cosmic radiation increases the risk of nuclear cataract in airline pilots: a population-based case-control study | journal = Arch Ophthalmol | volume = 123 | pages = 1102-1105}}</ref> Cataracts are also unusually common in persons exposed to infrared radiation, such as [[Glassblowing|glassblowers]] who suffer from  "exfoliation syndrome". Exposure to microwave radiation can cause cataracts.

Cataracts may be partial or complete, stationary or progressive, hard or soft.

Some drugs can induce cataract development, such as [[Corticosteroids]]<ref name=spencer>{{cite journal |author=SPENCER R, ANDELMAN S |title=STEROIDSAREBAD CATARACTS. POSTERIOR SUBCAPSULAR CATARACT FORMATION IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS PATIENTS ON LONG TERM STEROID THERAPY |journal=Arch Ophthalmol |volume=74 |issue= |pages=38-41 |year= |pmid=14303339}}</ref>
and [[Ezetimibe]]{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

There are various types of cataracts, e.g. nuclear, cortical, mature, hypermature.  Cataracts are also classified by their location, e.g. posterior (classically due to steroid use<ref name=spencer/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Greiner J, Chylack L |title=Posterior subcapsular cataracts: histopathologic study of steroid-associated cataracts |journal=Arch Ophthalmol |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=135-44 |year=1979 |pmid=758890}}</ref>) and anterior (common (senile) cataract related to aging).

==Cataract surgery==
{{main|Cataract surgery}}

The most effective and common treatment is to surgically remove the cloudy lens. There are two types of [[surgery]] that can be used to remove cataracts: extra-capsular (extracapsular cataract extraction, or ECCE) and intra-capsular (intracapsular cataract extraction, or ICCE).

Extra-capsular (ECCE) surgery consists of removing the lens but leaving the majority of the [[lens capsule]] intact. [[High frequency]] [[sound wave]]s ([[phacoemulsification]]) are sometimes used to break up the lens before extraction.

Intra-capsular (ICCE) surgery involves removing the entire lens of the eye, including the lens capsule, but it is rarely performed in modern practice. In either extra-capsular surgery or intra-capsular surgery, the cataractous lens is removed and replaced with a [[plastic]] lens (an [[intraocular lens]] implant) which stays in the eye permanently.

Cataract operations are usually performed using a [[local anaesthetic]] and the patient is allowed to go home the same day. Recent improvements in intraocular technology now allow cataract patients to choose a multifocal lens to create a visual environment in which they are less dependent on glasses. Under some medical systems multifocal lenses cost extra. Traditional intraocular lenses are monofocal.

Complications after cataract surgery, including endophthalmitis, [[posterior capsular opacification]] and [[retinal detachment]], are possible. 

In ICCE there is the issue of the Jack in the box phenomenon where the patient has to wear [[aphakic]] glasses - alternatives include contact lenses but these can prove to be high maintenance, particularly in dusty areas.

==Prevention==
Although cataracts have no scientifically proven prevention, it is sometimes said that wearing [[ultraviolet]]-protecting [[sunglasses]] may slow the development of cataracts.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}<ref>Epidemiology. 2003 Nov;14(6):707-12. Sun exposure as a risk factor for nuclear cataract</ref>  Regular intake of [[antioxidants]] (such as vitamin C and E) is theoretically helpful, but this is also not proven by large, randomized, double blind studies.

== Recent research ==
Although [[statins]] are known for their ability to lower lipids, they are also believed to have antioxidant qualities.  It is believed that oxidative stress plays a role in the development of nuclear cataracts, which are the most common type of age-related cataract.  To explore the relationship between nuclear cataracts and statin use, a group of researchers took a group of 1299 patients who were at risk of developing nuclear cataracts and gave some of them statins.  Their results suggest that statin use in a general population may be associated with a lower risk of developing nuclear cataract disease. <ref>{{ cite journal | first = Barbara | last = Klein | coauthors = Ronald Klein, Kristine Lee, and Lisa Grady | title = Statin Use and Incident Nuclear Cataract | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 295 | issue = 23 | pages = 2752-2758}}</ref>

The following is a classification of the various types of cataracts. This is not comprehensive and other unusual types may be noted.
*Classified by etiology
:*Age-related cataract
::*Immature Senile Cataract (IMSC) - partially opaque lens, [[Optic disc|disc]] view hazy
::*Mature Senile Cataract (MSC) - Completely opaque lens, no disc view
::*Hypermature Senile Cataract (HMSC) - Liquefied cortical matter: '''Morgagnian Cataract'''
:*Congenital cataract
::*Sutural cataract
::*Lamellar cataract
::*Zonular cataract
::*Total cataract
:*Secondary cataract
[[Image:Anterior capsular opacification.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Slit lamp]] photo of Anterior capsular opacification visible few months after implantation of Intraocular lens in eye, magnified view]]
::*Drug-induced cataract (e.g. Corticosteroids)
:*Traumatic cataract
::*Blunt trauma (capsule usually intact)
::*Penetrating trauma (capsular rupture & leakage of lens material - calls for an emergency surgery for extraction of lens and leaked material to minimize further damage)

*Classified by location of opacity within lens structure (However, mixed morphology is quite commonly seen, e.g. PSC with nuclear changes & cortical spokes of cataract)
:*Anterior cortical cataract
:*Anterior polar cataract
:*Anterior subcapsular cataract
[[Image:Posterior capsular opacification on retroillumination.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Slit lamp]] photo of Posterior capsular opacification visible few months after implantation of Intraocular lens in eye, seen on retroillumination]]

:*Nuclear cataract - Grading correlates with hardness & difficulty of surgical removal 
::*1 - Grey 
::*2 - Yellow 
::*3 - Amber 
::*4 - Brown/Black (Note: "Black cataract" translated in some languages (like [[Hindi]]) refers to [[Glaucoma]], not the color of the lens nucleus)
:*Posterior cortical cataract
:*Posterior polar cataract (importance lies in higher risk of complication - posterior capsular tears during surgery)
:*Posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC) (clinically common)
::*After-cataract - posterior capsular opacification subsequent to  a successful extracapsular cataract surgery (usually within 3 months - 2 years) with or without IOL implantation. Requires a quick & painless office procedure with [[Nd:YAG laser]] capsulotomy to restore optical clarity.
