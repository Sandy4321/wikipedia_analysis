'''''Mother and Son''''' was an [[Australian]] [[television]] [[sitcom]] produced by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] from 1984 until 1994. The show starred [[Ruth Cracknell]], [[Garry McDonald]], [[Henri Szeps]] and [[Judy Morris]]. It was written by [[Geoffrey Atherden]].  

==Characters==
Cracknell played the aging Maggie Beare; an independent and determined woman gradually becoming [[senility|senile]] but who has, nevertheless, retained a difficult stubbornness and shrewd manipulative streak. This was most evident in her relationship with her sons, whom she manipulated in order to get away with more than she was entitled to. McDonald played her long-suffering care-giver son Arthur, whom she constantly, and, with breathtaking unfairness, blames for all the mishaps resulting from her own failing faculties. Maggie's tendency to forget previous things she had organised, sudden decisions to go off wandering, and invariable ability to ruin almost every attempt by Arthur to mix with friends, progress at work, or live a normal adult life (done, it is hinted, with some degree of shrewd purpose so she can keep her son completely devoted to caring for her) provided the basis for most of the episodes' plots. Henri Szeps plays the 'good' son, as Maggie thinks of him as an 'ANGEL' only finding out he's having an affair with Helen the nurse at his dental clinic.

==Storylines==
The storylines addressed the problem of ageing and caring for somebody with [[Alzheimer's disease]] with an often sharp-edged humour which carried with it a tinge of sadness. Despite its unlikely subject-matter for a comedy, the show was a popular favourite with audiences. Maggie and Arthur's relationship was presented with a fascinating complexity - Maggie's cruel attacks on and emotional manipulation of Arthur disguised her deep dependence on and need of him, and Arthur's dutiful love of Maggie was constantly in conflict with his guilty frustration at the huge limitations for his own life which looking after his mother entailed. The performance of Cracknell, a famous stage actress, as Maggie was particularly widely lauded as one of the finest characterisations Australian television has ever seen.

==The Beare Family==
'''Maggie Beare''': Widow of [[World War II|WWII]] veteran Leo, mother of Robert and Arthur, sister to Lorna and grandmother to Damien and Teonie. Maggie is in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease and her youngest son Arthur lives with and takes care of her. However, despite being increasingly forgetful, Maggie is lucid enough to manipulate Arthur when she wants to, usually for something devilish that will seriously inconvenience him.   

'''Arthur Beare''': Youngest son of Maggie and Leo, brother of Robert, uncle to Damien and Teonie and recent ex-husband of Deidre. Arthur is an [[Copy editing|editor]] and [[journalist]] for a newspaper, who, when he isn't working, is usually at home attending to the demands of his impish and increasingly confused mother. He drives a 1955 Morris Minor Series II Tourer <ref>http://www.caradvice.com.au/9296/mother-and-son-morris-for-sale/</ref> convertible that is constantly breaking down, has trouble bringing dates back to the house, and is almost always thwarted by Maggie whenever he attempts to socialize with his work-friends.

'''Robert Beare''': Eldest son of Maggie and Leo, brother of Arthur, husband to Liz and father of Damien and Teonie. Robert is a successful dentist who likes to take lots of holidays and have extramarital affairs. He is a 'man of leisure' who is adept at providing excuses as to why it is Arthur and not him that must take the primary care of their elderly mother. Robert loves to play tennis and golf and throughout the show, owns 3 cars; a Jaguar, Volvo and a [[BMW]]. When Arthur asked him for a loan to buy a new car, all Robert would offer him was a seriously impaired Volvo at a discount.   

'''Liz Beare''': Wife of Robert, mother to Damien and Teonie. The long-suffering Liz is well-aware of her husband's affairs but finds it difficult to prove any of them, due to Robert's well-honed skill at covering them up. So in the meantime, Liz compensates by spending Robert's money and socialising with her equally rich, bored and unhappy friends. She occasionally seeks consolation from Arthur, using behaviour that could suggest that she is attracted to him.  She is frequently, however, just as insensitive and selfish as Robert is and just as eager to put Maggie in a home.  Liz has a verbal drawl, and is frequently heard to say "Oh Gawd" or "You're weird Arthur".

'''Damien Beare''': Grandson of Maggie, son of Robert and Liz, nephew to Arthur and brother of Teonie. Appears in only one episode. Somewhat ill-behaved and bored of family outings.

'''Teonie Beare''': Granddaughter of Maggie, daughter of Robert and Liz, niece to Arthur and sister of Damien. Appears in only one episode. Constantly reminding her mother to compare her behaviour to her brother's.

'''Deidre Beare''': Ex-Wife of Arthur. Appears in 5 episodes. They decide to get back together in the last episode.

'''Aunty Lorna''': Sister of Maggie. Appears in only 3 episodes. She is married to Stan and has 3 children - Colin, Dawn and Murray. She is the "younger and prettier" sister, much to Maggie's chagrin. (Note: Stan, Colin, Dawn and Murray do not appear in the show, and in the second episode in which Lorna appears, it is revealed that Stan has recently died).
