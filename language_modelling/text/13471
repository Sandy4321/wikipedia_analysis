The building operated as a mill for more than a century until its closure in the 1960s. Following restoration, it operated again for a short while as a working mill for the creation of [[Wholemeal flour|wholemeal flour]] for Lifeforce Foods.<ref name="Ingenious Ireland Mulvihill">{{cite book|last1=Mulvihill|first1=Mary|title=Ingenious Ireland|date=2002|publisher=TownHouse and CountryHouse Ltd|location=Dublin|isbn=1860591450|page=226|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=exics12jmtwC&pg=PA226&lpg=PA226&dq=Lifeforce+Mill+%2B+A+Darling+Little+Mill&source=bl&ots=n2pVHkMMws&sig=2Y8Q3akMMnjHYKeAGG8zC5hunPY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=59VhVYmtNcSt7gaV6IDYAw&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Lifeforce%20Mill%20%2B%20A%20Darling%20Little%20Mill&f=false|accessdate=24 May 2015}}</ref>
   
==Design of the building==
The two-storey design has a three-bay extension at split level to the west and a two-storey return to the side. An adjacent mill building to the north was removed from its original site and rebuilt here in 1995 as part of the mill's restoration.<ref name="National Inventory of Architectural Heritage">{{cite web|title=Main Record <U+2013> County Cavan|url=http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=CV&regno=40001069|website=buildingsofireland.ie|publisher=National Inventory of Architectural Heritage|accessdate=24 May 2015}}</ref> As the only surviving example of one of the five mills that stood in Cavan Town, it is listed on the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage for Ireland.<ref name="National Inventory of Architectural Heritage">{{cite web|title=Main Record <U+2013> County Cavan|url=http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=CV&regno=40001069|website=buildingsofireland.ie|publisher=National Inventory of Architectural Heritage|accessdate=24 May 2015}}</ref>

=== MacAdam Turbine ===
[[image: Copy10_(2).jpg|thumb|160px|Cavan Water Mill cogs]]    
Cavan Water Mill operates a MacAdam [[turbine]] as opposed to a conventional [[water wheel]]. The turbine was described as one of the few, if not the only surviving MacAdam Turbines in [[Ulster]] in 1983.<ref name ="Anglo Celt">Anglo Celt, Professor Alan Crocker. Retrived from http://www.anglocelt.ie/photostore/image-31352</ref> The turbine may be an example of 19th-century industrial espionage, as it is believed to be a pirated copy of a design by [[Beno<U+00EE>t Fourneyron]].<ref name="Ingenious Ireland Mulvihill">{{cite book|last1=Mulvihill|first1=Mary|title=Ingenious Ireland|date=2002|publisher=TownHouse and CountryHouse Ltd|location=Dublin|isbn=1860591450|page=226|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=exics12jmtwC&pg=PA226&lpg=PA226&dq=Lifeforce+Mill+%2B+A+Darling+Little+Mill&source=bl&ots=n2pVHkMMws&sig=2Y8Q3akMMnjHYKeAGG8zC5hunPY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=59VhVYmtNcSt7gaV6IDYAw&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Lifeforce%20Mill%20%2B%20A%20Darling%20Little%20Mill&f=false|accessdate=24 May 2015}}</ref> A similar turbine was installed at [[Ballincollig Royal Gunpowder Mills]], [[Cork]] in 1853.<ref name="Ingenious Ireland Mulvihill">{{cite book|last1=Mulvihill|first1=Mary|title=Ingenious Ireland|date=2002|publisher=TownHouse and CountryHouse Ltd|location=Dublin|isbn=1860591450|page=226|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=exics12jmtwC&pg=PA226&lpg=PA226&dq=Lifeforce+Mill+%2B+A+Darling+Little+Mill&source=bl&ots=n2pVHkMMws&sig=2Y8Q3akMMnjHYKeAGG8zC5hunPY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=59VhVYmtNcSt7gaV6IDYAw&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Lifeforce%20Mill%20%2B%20A%20Darling%20Little%20Mill&f=false|accessdate=24 May 2015}}</ref>
